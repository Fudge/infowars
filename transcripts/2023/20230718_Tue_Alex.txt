[00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:14.117]  First of all, we have accusatory commentary of Soros' DAs.
[00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:24.622]  Let us not put an individual that is not here, a contributing American, and jeopardize his life by always throwing his name out in the most ugliest way.
[00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:26.162]  I am offended by that.
[00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:29.964]  Ladies and gentlemen, the system isn't going to save you and isn't going to be there when this goes down.
[00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:32.645]  Mr. Soros does not deserve that.
[00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:34.926]  He is an American and a patriot.
[00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:35.126]  But...
[00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:43.724]  If we work hard, the globalists won't come out on top of this collapse as the bosses to bring in a tyranny a thousand times worse.
[00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:51.126]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest in the very poorest places.
[00:00:51.126 --> 00:01:02.970]  And so it's really an acute problem in a certain number of places and we've got to make sure that we help out with the tools now so that they don't have an impossible situation later.
[00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.471]  That's their admitted plan.
[00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.231]  I'd like to call
[00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:17.874]  This idea, creative capitalism, an approach where governments, businesses, and non-profits work together to stretch the reach of market forces.
[00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:34.965]  So, we better be fighting as hard as we can, and fighting five times harder than these devils, to be affecting the battle space psychologically with the truth, exposing that they did it, they're the ones behind it, here's what they're going to try once the collapse accelerates, so people don't comply with them during the collapse.
[00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:38.387]  It is about having a world government.
[00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:40.128]  A new world order.
[00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:43.050]  They are the ones who will govern the world.
[00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:52.116]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[00:01:52.116 --> 00:02:00.462]  There was to be a government by these elites who will impose their rules on everyone in this world.
[00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:09.256]  And for those who are unwilling to submit to them, there will be punishment.
[00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:13.060]  Now the population of the world is 7 billion.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.801]  There will be a need
[00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:25.374]  To kill many billions of people, or to stop them to death, or to prevent them from giving birth, in order to reduce the population of this world.
[00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:40.703]  Because they're gonna release a new virus, and, you know, be locking people up, and promising to bring back the good times, if you just take your shot, or oh, if your neighbor went away, but Bob was causing a problem and not going along with it, you know, they're the non-compliers, you'll get your electricity back.
[00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:42.905]  So we, you know, we'll have to
[00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:55.206]  You're being put in the process of being once free, now being a slave.
[00:02:55.206 --> 00:03:02.175]  Like the Bank of England already prepared their microchip implant RFID chip to be implanted under your skin.
[00:03:04.114 --> 00:03:11.536]  And why is the sudden discussion about universal basic income from all the grassroots and inverted commas movements and billionaires?
[00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:15.017]  Oh, universal basic income is the bribe for you to accept the microchip.
[00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:22.099]  The downside of governments being able to track digitally every single product or service you buy and sell is chilling.
[00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.741]  CBDC can improve financial inclusion is through what we call programmability.
[00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.541]  They think you're weak.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.362]  They think you're stupid?
[00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:41.269]  What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.954]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:53.680]  We're now seeing mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.364]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[00:03:58.044 --> 00:04:02.189]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.671]  Now it's going under the skin.
[00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:08.395]  I don't hate the military, I don't hate the Border Patrol, but they're just like average Americans.
[00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:10.537]  They follow criminal orders.
[00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:11.899]  Is there a crisis at our southern border?
[00:04:13.362 --> 00:04:17.704]  Senator, there is a very significant... That's a yes or no question.
[00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:19.205]  Is there a crisis?
[00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:32.071]  Mr. Secretary, I want to say to you right now, your behavior is disgraceful, and the deaths, the children assaulted, the children raped, they are at your feet, and if you had integrity, you would resign.
[00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.553]  Just keep pretending, everybody, that we aren't overrun.
[00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:40.623]  You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.
[00:04:40.623 --> 00:04:42.844]  But it ain't about how hard you hit.
[00:04:42.844 --> 00:04:46.465]  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
[00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:49.946]  How much you can take and keep moving forward.
[00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:51.486]  That's how winning is done!
[00:04:51.486 --> 00:04:54.027]  Nobody's coming to save you but yourself.
[00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.507]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:56.948]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[00:04:56.948 --> 00:04:57.888]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:10.151]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:15.456]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:05:15.896 --> 00:05:17.577]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:20.559]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:22.199]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.102]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:05:27.102 --> 00:05:28.843]  This is something you need now.
[00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:33.425]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:39.129]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:45.312]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:46.512]  We're good to go.
[00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.512]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:38.182]  I demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated.
[00:06:38.182 --> 00:06:40.743]  Lawfully slated.
[00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:44.466]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building
[00:06:45.339 --> 00:07:02.833]  To peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today, we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections, but whether or not they stand strong for our country.
[00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:07.156]  That was President Trump on January 6th, 2021.
[00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.098]  I was there in the second row right in front of him.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:30.614]  And we had every intention of marching peacefully, as we've done in hundreds of marches around the country and several to the Capitol just in the months before, to then show the world that Biden couldn't get a big crowd at his events, that we had big crowds at our events, and push for what the Democrats have done many times before, the challenging of an election in the U.S.
[00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:31.975]  Senate with a 10-day investigation.
[00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:42.646]  Can play you hours of compilations of them going back over the decades, but just 8, 9, 10 years ago saying this election's a fraud, we're challenging the electors, we're bringing forth our own electors.
[00:07:42.646 --> 00:08:00.652]  You have the Democratic Party of the New York Times, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, saying a month before the election in 2020 that we don't care if he wins, we're not going to accept the results if we're going to have our own inauguration somewhere else in the country for Joe Biden.
[00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:03.866]  Then they said, oh, the red mirage.
[00:08:03.866 --> 00:08:05.787]  It'll look like he's going to win.
[00:08:05.787 --> 00:08:08.468]  And then he'll really lose weeks after from the mail-in ballots.
[00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:10.449]  Wink, wink.
[00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:12.690]  And the rest is history.
[00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.591]  So now Trump has come out this morning in a press release.
[00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.871]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:21.153]  Let's put the live show feed up because it boils it down the best.
[00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:29.097]  And said he's been told by the FBI and Justice Department in a targeting letter that he is the main target of a grand jury.
[00:08:30.114 --> 00:08:34.039]  That he has four days to be ready to appear before the grand jury.
[00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:39.726]  And at that point, they'll probably sneak attack him and indict him and arrest him on the spot and may even try to put him in the D.C.
[00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:40.487]  jail.
[00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:42.450]  They own D.C.
[00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.711]  94% Democrat.
[00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:47.997]  They could, again, send a newborn baby to the gas chamber if the Democrat ordered a jury tube.
[00:08:49.778 --> 00:08:56.243]  Trump received target letter from Biden's DOJ, says they will arrest and indict him over January 6th.
[00:08:56.243 --> 00:09:02.348]  Just like he said Alvin Bragg was going to indict him and have him turn himself in, and it happened.
[00:09:02.348 --> 00:09:09.393]  And just like he said again, they would do it with the presidential document issues.
[00:09:09.393 --> 00:09:12.615]  After all, you can't have a president with any presidential documents.
[00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:16.538]  It belongs to bureaucracy, not to the president we elected.
[00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:18.200]  And now he's saying this is imminent.
[00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:21.846]  This is beyond a constitutional crisis, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:29.270]  This is the globalists completing the coup that they've been involved in over this country for a long time.
[00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.211]  They have control of the federal government.
[00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:32.431]  They have control of many state governments.
[00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:39.235]  They have control of 900 plus district attorneys, county attorneys, 20 plus state attorney generals.
[00:09:39.235 --> 00:09:45.799]  But they want to complete the total control with their surveillance and their censorship and the pushing by the puppet president.
[00:09:46.713 --> 00:09:50.494]  Biden's just Obama's puppet.
[00:09:50.494 --> 00:10:01.197]  That anyone challenging elections, anyone challenging open borders, anyone challenging any type of tyranny is a white supremacist and is a terrorist and is an enemy.
[00:10:01.197 --> 00:10:06.578]  So they're outlawing their political opposition in front of the whole world right now.
[00:10:06.578 --> 00:10:08.999]  They're converting us to a classical tyranny.
[00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:12.620]  Our country is occupied by an out of control bureaucracy.
[00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:14.369]  We're good to go.
[00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:36.454]  But nevertheless, they are moving forward with it, not just here, but around the world.
[00:10:36.454 --> 00:10:38.614]  This is a huge deal.
[00:10:38.614 --> 00:10:41.035]  We knew this was coming just two weeks ago.
[00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:49.517]  It broke in the Washington Post, a lengthy 20-page article saying that the D.C.
[00:10:49.517 --> 00:11:01.660]  prosecutors had come to the Justice Department a year and a half ago and said, we want to indict Roger Stone and Alex Jones, claiming that we got orders from Trump to attack the Capitol.
[00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:14.633]  With no evidence and the DOJ said, Merrick Garland said, no, you didn't complete evidence from the bottom to the top that they were connected to Trump.
[00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:24.177]  We're going after Trump for challenge the election period and saying that that was an attempt to set up a coup d'etat.
[00:11:24.177 --> 00:11:28.179]  And so with no evidence, they're preparing to indict the president.
[00:11:30.734 --> 00:11:39.321]  They indicted him in DC, but the Supreme Court has ruled that you have to try somebody where their crime was committed, so he supposedly
[00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:46.767]  Has the stolen documents that were his at Mar-a-Lago, so the nearest federal courthouse is in Miami.
[00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:48.588]  And so that's where that trial's happening.
[00:11:48.588 --> 00:11:53.930]  And by luck of the draw, it's a judge that Trump put in that hopefully is fairer, so they're a little panicked by that.
[00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.491]  They're talking about indicting him in New Jersey, where he had documents at his golf club.
[00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:01.772]  And of course, the January 6th indictment is going to be the key one.
[00:12:01.772 --> 00:12:07.594]  And then they have to legitimize that he's really a terrorist and have his supporters supposedly stage events.
[00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:08.715]  And that's when you're going to see
[00:12:10.523 --> 00:12:21.667]  January 6th on steroids, where the deep state, the NGOs stage massive shootings, massive bombings, chemical attacks on apartment buildings, chemical weapons dumped in lakes.
[00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:27.430]  I'm giving you a smattering of what they're, from my research, up to.
[00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.670]  All to be blamed on us.
[00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.612]  Then they cut one of the main power grids off, one of the big six.
[00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.483]  And blame it on us.
[00:12:36.483 --> 00:12:40.506]  And I told you before they floated that last month that that's what I would do if I was them.
[00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:45.409]  Because I can already see the pre-programming that power outages are imminent, cyber attacks are imminent.
[00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:57.417]  They don't want to actually attack the infrastructure with 50 caliber rifles or something that the Congress has had hearings on that can easily be done with any caliber rifle, quite frankly, but just take more rounds with a smaller caliber.
[00:12:57.417 --> 00:12:58.298]  A hundred people
[00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:07.874]  Putting the right places around the country in two hours could shut down most of the grid, shooting the key transformers.
[00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:08.895]  And they know that.
[00:13:08.895 --> 00:13:10.156]  They should be shielded.
[00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:15.579]  They could shield them for $100 million, just put a little bit of armor around each one.
[00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:16.480]  But they don't do that.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.881]  They've decided to leave that there.
[00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:21.423]  But they're not saying that's how they're going to attack, because that would actually take the power off.
[00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:22.504]  The globalists want the power for now.
[00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:25.296]  Literal and figurative.
[00:13:25.296 --> 00:13:35.581]  So instead, I predicted they would not say it was going to be weapons or bombs taking out the key control centers around the country, the switch centers.
[00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:43.485]  It would be a cyber attack blamed on the Russians working with Trump supporters.
[00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:45.266]  And then sure enough, I've been saying that for two years.
[00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:48.508]  Sure enough, they come out last month and say, FBI bulletin.
[00:13:49.935 --> 00:13:55.688]  The Trump supporters working with the Russians are going to shut the power off using a cyber attack and then they'll have to cut the internet off.
[00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.270]  I predicted this too.
[00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:04.512]  The internet kill switch so that the evil right-wingers can't attack through the internet and keep the power off.
[00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:09.093]  And then, oh my gosh, we've got to have an internet ID after they turn the power back on.
[00:14:09.093 --> 00:14:16.215]  Only if you sign up online, sign up at an approved government site that you'll be able to go to, will you then get access to the web.
[00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:18.676]  And now they've got the internet ID in place.
[00:14:18.676 --> 00:14:25.338]  Now they've got the social credit score, carbon tax, vaccine passport, node.
[00:14:25.338 --> 00:14:25.798]  Skip this break.
[00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:30.074]  In place.
[00:14:30.074 --> 00:14:33.795]  And so they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:14:33.795 --> 00:14:38.976]  And I specifically laid all this out from their pre-brainwashing.
[00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:47.818]  I can see the next few pieces they would lay, and now they've... The only thing left now is for them to pull it off.
[00:14:47.818 --> 00:14:55.240]  Now, remember, the average leftist, the average person out there is still not awake, and if they don't have internet, or they don't have power,
[00:14:56.584 --> 00:15:03.186]  They're going to blame whoever the government and the media blames to get that back on.
[00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:06.747]  Just like, just take the shot, and they'll let you out of the house.
[00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:09.207]  Just stay in your house for 15 days, and they'll let you out.
[00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:11.708]  Oh, sorry, it's two years.
[00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:14.069]  Just take the shot, one shot, you're covered 100%.
[00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:15.189]  Sorry, it's two.
[00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:18.170]  No, I'm at three, five, eight, nine, ten.
[00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.250]  It's a weekly shot.
[00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:24.011]  I'm sorry, and it doesn't protect you, but I forget why I'm taking shots.
[00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:25.772]  So it's all about roping the dope
[00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:35.441]  Because if you remember, the general public, the way television's been designed the last 70 years, this is on record, is to shorten attention spans down to less than 12 seconds.
[00:15:35.441 --> 00:15:40.562]  The average person has less than a 12 second attention span.
[00:15:40.562 --> 00:15:43.823]  A goldfish has a little over that, 14.
[00:15:43.823 --> 00:15:52.345]  So you've seen like Dory, who's not a goldfish, but it's a similar fish, doesn't have an attention span, that's a known species that doesn't remember who you are second to second.
[00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:52.945]  The public
[00:15:54.697 --> 00:15:57.338]  Most of the public is not even mentally retarded.
[00:15:57.338 --> 00:16:02.380]  They're just been brainwashed and programmed to have no attention span.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:11.864]  That's why they hate the clips of me 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, predicting this word for word because people see those clips and it's a younger Alex Jones.
[00:16:11.864 --> 00:16:13.984]  They see the date and they go, well, that's exactly what happened.
[00:16:13.984 --> 00:16:15.745]  How the hell does this guy know this?
[00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:21.287]  Well, because the enemy thinks you're a goldfish and has a plan.
[00:16:21.287 --> 00:16:22.948]  I'd liken it to the fictional movie
[00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:37.558]  What was the fictional movie where the aliens are able to time travel back in time every time they start losing a battle and then end up defeating the humans?
[00:16:37.558 --> 00:16:39.439]  They land in Paris.
[00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:40.379]  It's a Tom Cruise movie.
[00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:43.881]  What's it called?
[00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:48.782]  No, that's not what it's called.
[00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:52.924]  Oh, they change the title from Day After Tomorrow to whatever it is.
[00:16:53.874 --> 00:16:54.614]  Live, die, repeat.
[00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:55.215]  Live, die, repeat.
[00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.015]  Yeah.
[00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:58.056]  So it's kind of the same deal.
[00:16:58.056 --> 00:17:05.319]  Someone without an attention span who doesn't access all their memory literally is like waking up new all the time.
[00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:12.962]  So the humans are always in the same position and wondering why the aliens are kicking their ass because it turns out they've already had like 500 battles with us.
[00:17:14.642 --> 00:17:17.308]  And so, in your memory, you think you're getting your ass kicked right away.
[00:17:17.308 --> 00:17:18.070]  No, no, no.
[00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.313]  They've got long-term memory.
[00:17:19.313 --> 00:17:21.117]  They've been strategically planning it out.
[00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:24.064]  All you've got to do is access your long-term memory.
[00:17:25.293 --> 00:17:42.023]  All you've got to do is start literally realizing they write books and white papers and say, we're going to take everything you've got, we're going to cut your resources off, we're going to slowly starve you to death, but because you don't have a memory, we'll do it in steps, and you'll actually think we're the saviors as we take it away from you piece by piece by piece.
[00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:45.485]  I mean, folks, this is so simple.
[00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:54.370]  And the power of having a memory, the power of reading their plans, and then knowing they're going to carry them out, and being able to know what their next move is, we have their battle plan.
[00:17:56.556 --> 00:18:08.965]  But because you won't have a memory, or because you won't value having a memory, then what would happen?
[00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:11.207]  You see?
[00:18:11.207 --> 00:18:12.228]  But one character
[00:18:13.504 --> 00:18:18.970]  In this fictional world Tom Cruise for some reason does have a memory each time he gets killed and remember.
[00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:27.760]  So one human has some weird evolutionary mind warp or something that he's able to psychically tune into the mothership alien pod brain
[00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:29.861]  I'm going from memory, I only saw it once.
[00:18:29.861 --> 00:18:32.202]  I'm going to watch the movie again.
[00:18:32.202 --> 00:18:41.044]  And he's able to dial into the pod brain, too, like the other aliens are, so one guy knows how to beat him just because he has the knowledge of their long-term plan.
[00:18:41.044 --> 00:18:44.465]  And folks, that's how this is, except this isn't a Tom Cruise movie.
[00:18:44.465 --> 00:18:46.525]  This is for real, okay?
[00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:51.286]  I mean, these people are literally putting chemicals in the food and water that sterilize you.
[00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:57.468]  They're literally putting up 5G that kills even the birds that live by and the bees, not to mention you.
[00:18:58.317 --> 00:19:00.658]  We are literally already in the boiling pot.
[00:19:00.658 --> 00:19:02.998]  They are already carrying this out.
[00:19:02.998 --> 00:19:08.559]  And I am sitting here like Tom Cruise in Day After Tomorrow.
[00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:11.280]  Knowing the whole battle plan.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.520]  Knowing what's going on.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:21.202]  We'll put it's IMDB up.
[00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.142]  Edge of tomorrow.
[00:19:22.142 --> 00:19:23.902]  Edge of tomorrow.
[00:19:23.902 --> 00:19:26.403]  So, that's where we are.
[00:19:26.403 --> 00:19:26.523]  And
[00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:33.523]  It's time for people to realize we're on the edge of tomorrow.
[00:19:33.523 --> 00:19:35.266]  We are on the edge of oblivion here.
[00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:37.476]  Because I understand.
[00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.617]  You want to go home and eat a good dinner.
[00:19:38.617 --> 00:19:40.337]  You want to go home and watch your Netflix show.
[00:19:40.337 --> 00:19:42.518]  You want to go home and have sex with your wife.
[00:19:42.518 --> 00:19:47.400]  You want to go home and play ping pong or video games or go to the gym.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.560]  And that's all fine and dandy.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:56.783]  But while you're doing that, the globalists have a 50-year plan, a 100-year plan, a 500-year plan, and they're carrying out this globalist plan against us.
[00:19:56.783 --> 00:20:03.826]  And we're now in the last 10% of the plan where they start cutting all the resources off and having us fight with each other as everything collapses.
[00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:10.640]  Let me just get back to what I was going to say.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.201]  To have a president, now listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:20:15.201 --> 00:20:33.545]  All the evidence says Trump won the 2020 election by 15 points or so, but they were able, with tens of millions of mail-in ballots and the database that Zuckerberg spent hundreds of millions on of dead people and people that had moved out of the districts, they were able to then have safe houses all over the key battleground states, about eight of them,
[00:20:34.847 --> 00:20:37.671]  Go and fill out those with the people's info.
[00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:38.633]  Get rid of the regulations.
[00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:43.600]  There has to be ID shown or signature verification.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.503]  And they were able to steal it.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:48.587]  After the polls closed, they were able to do it the next week.
[00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:52.055]  But that's not even the issue for debate.
[00:20:52.055 --> 00:20:54.176]  They censored the laptop.
[00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:56.077]  They blocked Republican information.
[00:20:56.077 --> 00:21:00.900]  They censored Trump supporters from going out and getting people to vote Trump.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.821]  That was admitted election meddling.
[00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:06.683]  So they did steal the 2020 election anyway you slice it.
[00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:07.063]  But now...
[00:21:08.348 --> 00:21:12.269]  Undeniably, zero chance it's not happening.
[00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:22.631]  They are indicting over and over and over again, someone who's getting 75% of the votes in major polls against all other Republicans.
[00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:24.772]  You got like nine other Republicans running.
[00:21:24.772 --> 00:21:29.753]  Trump gets 75% against them in polls.
[00:21:29.753 --> 00:21:32.093]  He's 20 to 30 points, depending on the poll.
[00:21:32.093 --> 00:21:33.954]  I had a Biden in every poll.
[00:21:33.954 --> 00:21:34.694]  At least 20 points ahead.
[00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:46.447]  Never in a hundred plus years of modern polling has anybody ever been 25 points ahead of the Democrat nominee, or the Democrat president, or the presumptive nominee.
[00:21:48.752 --> 00:21:58.539]  That is 100% bona fide, the real McCoy, not just election meddling, it is precluding you, they're saying, from being able to vote for this man.
[00:21:58.539 --> 00:22:06.686]  And Biden said in December last year, it doesn't matter what Trump does, we're not going to let him get elected, we're going to use constitutional means.
[00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:10.629]  The only constitutional means are criminal!
[00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:16.093]  It's in the Constitution that if somebody can be impeached if they're involved in all these crimes.
[00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:20.526]  So they're impeaching him, not through Congress.
[00:22:20.526 --> 00:22:21.787]  Both of their impeachments failed.
[00:22:21.787 --> 00:22:24.628]  I think the public's so stupid they don't know that those failed.
[00:22:24.628 --> 00:22:25.729]  The House indicts you.
[00:22:25.729 --> 00:22:26.789]  The Senate tries you.
[00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:28.050]  It never got to the Senate.
[00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:33.192]  So they've already indicted him twice federally in Congress, and he beat those.
[00:22:33.192 --> 00:22:35.513]  And they had the fake Russiagate and all the rest of that crap.
[00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:45.646]  And then now they're bringing forward multiple federal indictments, state indictments, because Georgia's about to do it as well, not just New York, with Alvin Bragg.
[00:22:45.646 --> 00:22:48.807]  I mean, this is coup d'etat.
[00:22:48.807 --> 00:22:56.411]  You always hear about third world countries where, well, the high court and the Congress have had the former president indicted during the campaign.
[00:22:56.411 --> 00:23:03.455]  We all go, man, how dare them do that in Nicaragua or in some place like Venezuela.
[00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:12.092]  So you see the headlines, Trump target January 6th probe, indictment watch, Republicans debate impeaching Attorney General.
[00:23:12.092 --> 00:23:14.654]  Yes, that needs to happen immediately.
[00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:20.478]  We have to get back on the offense because people say, oh that's meddling in government to impeach.
[00:23:20.478 --> 00:23:22.219]  No, that's Congress's power.
[00:23:22.219 --> 00:23:29.305]  This is the bureaucracy and the sitting president that stole the election, that couldn't get 10 people in his rallies, literally.
[00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:37.184]  Going and shutting down the incredibly popular president they stole the election from, and if you doubt that...
[00:23:38.905 --> 00:24:05.645]  They had Elias, the Democrat lawyer, run around in eight different states, nine different states, and try to get courts to preclude Marjorie Taylor Greene and Gozer and a bunch of others from being able to run again, saying, because you were in the Capitol on January 6th as elected members of Congress, it's your fault protesters were there by extension, guilt by association, so you can't run for Congress because you're winning by 20 points as MTG did.
[00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:16.100]  Well, Trump's set to win not by 20 points, 21 points, which is the largest winning margin for a Republican, is MTG.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.440]  She wins by the biggest landslide.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:26.361]  And now Trump's got a bigger landslide ready, and they say, you can't have Trump.
[00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:31.602]  You can't have who you want.
[00:24:31.602 --> 00:24:33.963]  Even if I didn't like Trump, I would say this is wrong.
[00:24:35.285 --> 00:24:36.385]  I mean, I don't like Obama.
[00:24:36.385 --> 00:24:38.586]  He was a horrible person, but he did get elected.
[00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:39.426]  He was popular.
[00:24:39.426 --> 00:24:40.827]  He was able to con people.
[00:24:40.827 --> 00:24:44.508]  That's not the case with Biden, and we all know that.
[00:24:44.508 --> 00:24:49.110]  And so, the deep state is destroying our country.
[00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.230]  They're starting World War III.
[00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.531]  Trump has pledged to stop it.
[00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:52.051]  The U.S.
[00:24:52.051 --> 00:24:52.431]  runs it.
[00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:53.271]  Of course he can stop it.
[00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:54.692]  They're like, how are you going to stop it?
[00:24:54.692 --> 00:24:55.032]  Like that.
[00:24:55.922 --> 00:24:57.063]  He's pledged to control the border.
[00:24:57.063 --> 00:24:58.204]  He's pledged to bring jobs back.
[00:24:58.204 --> 00:25:02.006]  He's pledged to get legislation in so they can't force you to take shots.
[00:25:02.006 --> 00:25:03.327]  He says he'll make the military take them.
[00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:04.348]  He's not perfect.
[00:25:04.348 --> 00:25:07.250]  But ladies and gentlemen, he's not out to get us.
[00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:14.595]  He isn't banning oil drilling all over the country and gas drilling and draining our strategic reserve down to almost nothing while
[00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:19.153]  Asking Saudi Arabia to increase output at our expense.
[00:25:19.153 --> 00:25:24.318]  The globalists are trying to break our will, make us poor, to put us all on welfare, to run our lives.
[00:25:24.318 --> 00:25:27.021]  Cloward and Pippen, that's their plan.
[00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:29.343]  And it is such a big deal.
[00:25:29.343 --> 00:25:32.266]  It is so unbelievably over the top.
[00:25:32.266 --> 00:25:33.127]  And so tone deaf.
[00:25:34.383 --> 00:25:49.845]  That this maniac Justice Department, with the above the law Biden and his son, the crackhead pedophiles, and the cocaine in the White House, and the Chinese spies, and the groping of kids in public, and just all the bizarreness, and then you've got them going after this
[00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:54.063]  Straight-laced person compared to them.
[00:25:54.063 --> 00:25:56.345]  Donald Trump with all these fake indictments.
[00:25:56.345 --> 00:25:58.506]  They are insane to try this.
[00:25:58.506 --> 00:25:59.707]  They are crazy.
[00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:11.156]  Do they think if he went up 10, 20, 30 points with the first indictment, and the second indictment, the third indictment... Do they think when he's in front of a DC kangaroo operation, that's circus?
[00:26:11.156 --> 00:26:12.397]  Then what do you think that's gonna be?
[00:26:12.397 --> 00:26:14.238]  Well, I know what their plan is.
[00:26:14.238 --> 00:26:18.702]  Any way you slice it, the globalists will be destroyed by this politically, except the false flag.
[00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:30.061]  First press conference Biden had with Psaki, he said, anybody questioning open borders, the election, or forced injections, or lockdowns is a terrorist.
[00:26:30.061 --> 00:26:35.604]  And worse, our main directive for the agencies is to fight with the American people, and to surveil them and go after them.
[00:26:35.604 --> 00:26:37.145]  And then he put it under U.S.
[00:26:37.145 --> 00:26:41.688]  directive in June of that same year, saying the American people are the number one enemy.
[00:26:41.688 --> 00:26:43.129]  What an incredible statement!
[00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:44.309]  I made a big deal about it.
[00:26:44.309 --> 00:26:46.551]  Now they've mainlined that, and they admit that.
[00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:50.352]  You go and you don't want your kid being taught how to have sex with adults?
[00:26:50.352 --> 00:26:54.273]  You don't want triple X child porn in your school?
[00:26:54.273 --> 00:26:55.633]  The FBI's coming after you.
[00:26:55.633 --> 00:26:56.334]  Well, you know what?
[00:26:56.334 --> 00:26:59.555]  Get all of us then!
[00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:03.916]  But see, they're gonna cut the power.
[00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:06.216]  They're gonna take the internet.
[00:27:06.216 --> 00:27:07.597]  They're gonna make January 6th
[00:27:09.636 --> 00:27:15.539]  Persecution of the American people looked like child's play because that was just the beginning to brand us as the enemy.
[00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:16.959]  And what was that based on?
[00:27:16.959 --> 00:27:18.680]  Provocateurs.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.542]  The DC Police attacking the Capitol Police dressed as Trump supporters.
[00:27:22.542 --> 00:27:23.823]  Antifa, same deal.
[00:27:23.823 --> 00:27:26.364]  Ray Epps orchestrating, in his own words, all of it.
[00:27:28.473 --> 00:27:29.274]  They're not going to.
[00:27:29.274 --> 00:27:31.115]  I don't believe they're going to indict Ray Epps.
[00:27:31.115 --> 00:27:34.959]  That's his lawyers saying that in a filing to make it sound like he was indicted.
[00:27:34.959 --> 00:27:37.741]  People believe he's been indicted now because you have a short memory.
[00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:39.382]  People tell me, no, no, Ray Epps was indicted.
[00:27:39.382 --> 00:27:44.287]  I get my phone out and I go, no, his lawyers say they said he may be indicted.
[00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:45.528]  Oh, I thought he was indicted.
[00:27:45.528 --> 00:27:46.589]  See, it's all mind games.
[00:27:46.589 --> 00:27:52.314]  And even if they do, they'll drop the prosecution later because people know, wait, he's ramming signs into people.
[00:27:52.314 --> 00:27:53.394]  He's the first to break in.
[00:27:53.394 --> 00:27:55.176]  He says, go into the Capitol for days.
[00:27:55.176 --> 00:27:55.977]  He's there that day.
[00:27:56.597 --> 00:28:04.722]  And then the media says he's an angel, but Owen Schroyer's been charged at the Capitol outside trying to stop people getting in?
[00:28:04.722 --> 00:28:11.727]  So they'll probably will maybe indict him, but just on the surface, because they're getting ready to indict the President of the United States.
[00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:18.204]  Who is the frontrunner against the Republicans and Democrats in the primary and general election.
[00:28:18.204 --> 00:28:19.684]  That is criminal.
[00:28:19.684 --> 00:28:21.205]  That is outrageous.
[00:28:21.205 --> 00:28:25.045]  And that on a scale of 1 to 10 on tyranny is a 10, baby.
[00:28:25.045 --> 00:28:27.846]  That is the end of the Republic as we know it.
[00:28:27.846 --> 00:28:35.867]  But these cokehead maniac pedophiles that run the Justice Department at the top were put in there because they're full of hate of this country and bravado and chutzpah.
[00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:38.488]  And they're going for the juggler of this country right now.
[00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:39.128]  And when they're done,
[00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:47.518]  When they're done setting off bombs and blaming it on the American people, they're gonna take everything you've got, including your children's genitals.
[00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:51.122]  They're gonna have lawnmowers out there just chopping your son's balls off.
[00:28:51.122 --> 00:28:54.225]  I mean, these are psychotic pedophiles.
[00:28:54.225 --> 00:28:56.187]  Mad dog, they want our blood.
[00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.852]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:29:01.852 --> 00:29:05.875]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can't be defeated.
[00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:09.058]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:29:09.058 --> 00:29:17.285]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:29:17.285 --> 00:29:20.888]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:29:20.888 --> 00:29:21.729]  This thing does 10,000 gallons
[00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:30.352]  You can sit there, put hundreds of gallons through it a day, it purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:32.373]  This is what I use, which my family uses.

[00:29:48.939 --> 00:29:55.922]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:29:55.922 --> 00:29:59.485]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:03.927]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Superfemale Vitality.
[00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:12.752]  Go to mfoolerstore.com, read about the ingredients, look them up for yourself, and then understand this is cold-pressed herbs, so it has a more powerful effect on the body.

[00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:23.921]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:29.305]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[00:30:29.305 --> 00:30:30.086]  It boosts men.
[00:30:30.086 --> 00:30:31.107]  It boosts women.
[00:30:31.107 --> 00:30:31.867]  It works great.
[00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:33.748]  But women like pink labels.
[00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:35.710]  Men like different color labels.
[00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.751]  So it works for men as well.
[00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:38.812]  It's the same formula.
[00:30:38.812 --> 00:30:40.073]  It's an incredible formula.
[00:30:40.073 --> 00:30:41.014]  And it funds our operation.
[00:30:41.014 --> 00:30:42.715]  And there's another important part of the
[00:30:43.055 --> 00:30:44.376]  Overall information.

[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.341]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:31:31.341 --> 00:31:33.082]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[00:31:33.082 --> 00:31:36.045]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:31:36.045 --> 00:31:38.046]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[00:31:38.046 --> 00:31:39.447]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:31:39.447 --> 00:31:41.549]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:44.532]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[00:31:44.532 --> 00:31:45.453]  I know times are tough.
[00:31:45.453 --> 00:31:46.895]  So, thank you for your support.
[00:31:46.895 --> 00:31:50.719]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[00:31:50.719 --> 00:31:52.020]  That you can do for free.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.183]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:31:54.183 --> 00:31:57.426]  So, however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[00:31:57.426 --> 00:31:58.528]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:31:59.088 --> 00:31:59.529]  God bless you.
[00:32:16.303 --> 00:32:20.287]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:32:20.287 --> 00:32:24.250]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:29.815]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:32:29.815 --> 00:32:37.522]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:43.167]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:32:43.587 --> 00:32:44.348]  Alright, we love you.
[00:32:44.348 --> 00:32:44.968]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:44.968 --> 00:32:49.972]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[00:32:49.972 --> 00:33:00.959]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:33:00.959 --> 00:33:06.864]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.531 --> 00:33:15.232]  Big Brother.
[00:33:15.232 --> 00:33:17.552]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:17.552 --> 00:33:19.313]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:19.313 --> 00:33:21.414]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:21.414 --> 00:33:23.555]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.555 --> 00:33:28.536]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.536 --> 00:33:41.941]  Alright, Roger Stone with the huge news that Trump is set to be indicted, according to Trump's lawyers and President Trump, as early as next week, maybe even tomorrow, as early as tomorrow, in the district of Mordor.
[00:33:43.829 --> 00:33:47.932]  Hell on the Potomac, the incredibly rigged court system.
[00:33:47.932 --> 00:33:51.434]  This is just terrible news.
[00:33:51.434 --> 00:33:52.635]  But we knew it was coming.
[00:33:52.635 --> 00:33:54.636]  Jack Smith is a U.N.
[00:33:54.636 --> 00:33:56.198]  operative.
[00:33:56.198 --> 00:34:02.302]  He's one of the most overturned prosecutors in history because he engages in just witch hunt after witch hunt.
[00:34:02.302 --> 00:34:06.765]  But they chose him because he does engage in so much fraud.
[00:34:07.523 --> 00:34:14.946]  And bullying of witnesses, blackmailing of witnesses, paying off witnesses, that's all coming out as well.
[00:34:14.946 --> 00:34:20.789]  So this is a very hardcore, serious group of criminals we're dealing with.
[00:34:20.789 --> 00:34:23.790]  And they've been tasked with completing their dictatorial takeover.
[00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.271]  And you're like, wow, they're really bold.
[00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:27.652]  Yeah, they've got the country under their control right now.
[00:34:27.652 --> 00:34:34.495]  They've opened the border up, they're involved in giant human trafficking, including children by the hundreds of thousands, many of which go into sex slavery.
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:43.373]  They don't do DNA testing of unaccompanied minors now so they find them dead later they know what happened or they find them alive later.
[00:34:43.373 --> 00:34:44.634]  They're covering their tracks.
[00:34:44.634 --> 00:34:46.596]  They're as bad as it gets.
[00:34:46.596 --> 00:34:52.421]  They're totally selfish, wicked villains who don't just don't care about you.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.601]  They hate your guts.
[00:34:55.601 --> 00:35:04.524]  I hate the proverbial statement of, oh, you know, people in government, these bureaucrats and these globalists, they just don't care about us.
[00:35:04.524 --> 00:35:08.185]  Oh, they care about you deeply.
[00:35:08.185 --> 00:35:11.207]  They want to kill you.
[00:35:11.207 --> 00:35:15.408]  I got stacks of articles of them admitting humans are scourges.
[00:35:15.408 --> 00:35:21.370]  If we can't kill babies in the womb, we're going to poison them later, or we're going to at least cut their genitals off.
[00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.711]  I'm going to play you the clips.
[00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:39.183]  Starting about five years ago, the left started saying, including Gloria Steinem, CIA officer, yeah, you know what, you say a baby's a human, they are, and I kill those little bastards, and I enjoy chopping up my children.
[00:35:39.183 --> 00:35:47.466]  And Peter Nygaard says, I get women pregnant with artificial insemination, and at least once a week, I suck one of my children dry.
[00:35:47.466 --> 00:35:52.188]  We take that dead baby, and I suck all its juices out, and I inject it into my veins.
[00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:55.810]  I kill my children.
[00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.751]  I suck their juice.
[00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:01.012]  But vampires aren't real.
[00:36:01.012 --> 00:36:05.913]  You've got to come to grips that you haven't turned yourself over to evil.
[00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:08.114]  So you're like, why do they even like this stuff?
[00:36:08.114 --> 00:36:15.036]  Once you get into evil and you're predisposed to it, I guess genetically, culturally, there's no bottom, folks.
[00:36:15.036 --> 00:36:16.676]  You're like, how evil do they get?
[00:36:16.676 --> 00:36:19.577]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, how evil can people get?
[00:36:20.529 --> 00:36:23.052]  And he said, as evil as good people let them.
[00:36:23.052 --> 00:36:26.937]  And there's letters back and forth, and they say, well, what do you mean, as evil as we let them get?
[00:36:26.937 --> 00:36:30.782]  And he goes, well, you'll always have one generation of corruption that's pretty bad.
[00:36:32.063 --> 00:36:37.927]  But there's always a group worse that will replace them, because evil won't constrain evil, only good will.
[00:36:37.927 --> 00:36:50.677]  So you're going to always basically develop a strain of evil that is so evil you can't even get your mind around it, and you're just dumbfounded like, you get women pregnant and then suck your babies dry and inject it into you?
[00:36:51.517 --> 00:36:58.802]  You make bioweapons in a lab and release it and then inject us with something that erases our immune system with an HIV spike protein?
[00:36:58.802 --> 00:37:00.763]  And you look at Fauci and he's like, yeah!
[00:37:00.763 --> 00:37:05.807]  And if you have discernment, not just his actions, he's an evil little man!
[00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:09.489]  I mean, you wouldn't turn your back on him for a second.
[00:37:09.489 --> 00:37:11.291]  You wouldn't let him babysit your children.
[00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:13.972]  You wouldn't do business with him.
[00:37:13.972 --> 00:37:15.253]  I mean, you can look at him.
[00:37:15.253 --> 00:37:17.575]  He's a disingenuous, evil man!
[00:37:20.051 --> 00:37:25.974]  A lot of times the book does judge the cover or a lot of times you do judge a book by its cover.
[00:37:25.974 --> 00:37:31.237]  So Trump has come out and put a statement out.
[00:37:31.237 --> 00:37:35.219]  He says, when you get these, it always means they're going to indict you.
[00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:42.282]  They let you know you're the target of a grand jury report to it within four days.
[00:37:42.282 --> 00:37:49.186]  So Trump now reports to a DC handpicked group and it turned out in Roger Stone's trial, you name it.
[00:37:50.151 --> 00:38:00.295]  Half the jury were Democratic Party operatives and were married to NSA officials that were Democrats and were posting on social media how they wanted to put Trump in prison.
[00:38:00.295 --> 00:38:01.635]  Should have been a total mistrial.
[00:38:01.635 --> 00:38:09.278]  Should have been the courts overturning Roger's conviction for lying to Congress, which he didn't do.
[00:38:09.278 --> 00:38:16.461]  And instead, Trump had to pardon him.
[00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:23.909]  The only thing necessary for triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
[00:38:23.909 --> 00:38:28.592]  Edmund Burke said something similar to Thomas Jefferson.
[00:38:28.592 --> 00:38:31.695]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[00:38:31.695 --> 00:38:34.037]  That's Thomas Jefferson.
[00:38:34.037 --> 00:38:36.939]  Who came first, chicken or the egg?
[00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:46.407]  So this is another Rubicon moment, this is another crossing the line moment, and all I can tell you is these people are incredibly dangerous and incredibly bold and incredibly insane.
[00:38:48.465 --> 00:39:00.631]  And I pray for President Trump, and I pray for an accelerated awakening, and I pray for all the enemy's plans to be confounded and for all their crimes to come out, which is happening.
[00:39:00.631 --> 00:39:02.531]  There's not this evil in the universe.
[00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:07.154]  And they have really engaged in the dark arts here.
[00:39:09.338 --> 00:39:11.359]  This is not going to end well for anybody.
[00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:20.142]  I mean, I can tell you right now, this is a gigantic, flaming disaster on a thousand different fronts.
[00:39:20.142 --> 00:39:24.144]  And we'll open the phones up after Roger leaves us for the balance of the broadcast.
[00:39:24.144 --> 00:39:27.345]  He'll pop in for a 30-minute start on the next hour.
[00:39:27.345 --> 00:39:32.147]  And so I'll give the number out when we're at about 12.06 when we come in to interview Roger.
[00:39:32.147 --> 00:39:33.048]  I'll give the number up.
[00:39:33.048 --> 00:39:34.568]  We'll get your calls all teed up.
[00:39:34.568 --> 00:39:36.869]  And we're going to talk about one subject.
[00:39:36.869 --> 00:39:37.870]  Republican crisis.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.681]  The looming D.C.
[00:39:40.681 --> 00:39:46.286]  swamp indictment of President Trump, the tentacles of the swamp reaching out and grabbing him.
[00:39:46.286 --> 00:39:48.267]  When what did Trump say on January 6th?
[00:39:48.267 --> 00:39:50.489]  We're going to play the clip in a moment.
[00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:51.390]  He said it over and over again.
[00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:58.295]  He said, we're going to peacefully and respectfully march down to our Capitol and let them know.
[00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:07.102]  And he'd been told that we had a stage at the corner, northeast corner by the Supreme Court on the Capitol grounds.
[00:40:08.175 --> 00:40:13.299]  And there was a stage set up there and we just figured, well, the Secret Service would be there and the police would be there.
[00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:20.464]  And we showed up and there were like 50 police at the Capitol being attacked by a couple thousand people led by raps.
[00:40:20.464 --> 00:40:24.367]  And it turns out the DC police were involved in attacking the Capitol Police.
[00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:27.189]  That's come out in Congress.
[00:40:27.189 --> 00:40:28.310]  And tear gas and everything.
[00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.751]  And they'd already got into the Capitol.
[00:40:29.751 --> 00:40:31.092]  And I said, you better get out of there.
[00:40:31.092 --> 00:40:33.233]  It's going to be Kent State.
[00:40:33.233 --> 00:40:34.134]  And it was Kent State.
[00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:41.274]  Ashley Babbitt and four other citizens got killed, but the truth didn't matter.
[00:40:41.274 --> 00:40:43.055]  They said five cops got killed that day.
[00:40:43.055 --> 00:40:46.257]  No cops got killed.
[00:40:46.257 --> 00:40:56.004]  And then they said by guilt by association, the million people stretched out from the Capitol down to the Ellipse, that million plus people stretched out for miles.
[00:40:56.004 --> 00:40:57.726]  You were all guilty!
[00:40:59.372 --> 00:41:08.057]  And the NSA and private companies, Datamine, whoever was in DC, and people that were there for a wedding, and people that were there for business, they got raided by the police.
[00:41:08.057 --> 00:41:09.958]  Because you're all part of an insurrection.
[00:41:09.958 --> 00:41:15.521]  You were all there with Trump ordering you to attack.
[00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:19.483]  Here's Trump saying at his political rally that he set up,
[00:41:20.515 --> 00:41:22.716]  Now let's peacefully march to the Capitol.
[00:41:22.716 --> 00:41:26.938]  And the globalists saw that weak point, and the Secret Service stood down.
[00:41:26.938 --> 00:41:29.259]  Trump's like, I'm going to my rally, I'm going to my speech.
[00:41:29.259 --> 00:41:30.320]  No, sir, you're not.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.820]  The Capitol's been attacked.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.322]  But the thing was, the Secret Service knew he was going.
[00:41:35.322 --> 00:41:37.563]  They knew it was all set up.
[00:41:37.563 --> 00:41:46.207]  Weeks before, they knew, but they withdrew the bureaucracy where I was counting on them, Trump was counting on them, and they did that.
[00:41:47.642 --> 00:41:52.386]  I'm not saying the rank-and-file Secret Service are involved, but we know the rest of the history.
[00:41:52.386 --> 00:41:56.850]  We were set up, and now they've got big enough balls in the rigged D.C.
[00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:01.294]  court to indict him for the federal false flag operation they ran on January 6th.
[00:42:01.294 --> 00:42:02.615]  Here's a clip of Trump.
[00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:11.863]  Come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated.
[00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:12.904]  Lawfully slated.
[00:42:14.406 --> 00:42:23.434]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.
[00:42:23.434 --> 00:42:35.083]  Today, we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections, but whether or not they stand strong for our country.
[00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:37.305]  All right, we're going to break.
[00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:41.569]  I'm going to come back and give you a little prelude to the other news we'll cover.
[00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:44.230]  Admiral Rodgers Stone leaves us and we take your calls.
[00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.230]  And it's crazy.
[00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.151]  It's wild.
[00:42:46.151 --> 00:42:47.592]  It's amazing.
[00:42:47.592 --> 00:42:48.272]  It's important.
[00:42:48.272 --> 00:42:49.633]  It's the real world.
[00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:52.674]  You're not tuned into Fantasy World, Netflix, or HBO.
[00:42:52.674 --> 00:42:54.195]  You're tuned into the real world.
[00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:54.455]  Earth 2023.
[00:42:54.455 --> 00:42:54.895]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.773 --> 00:43:01.953]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:43:01.953 --> 00:43:05.954]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:43:05.954 --> 00:43:09.155]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:43:09.155 --> 00:43:17.377]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:43:17.377 --> 00:43:20.978]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:43:20.978 --> 00:43:21.818]  This thing does 10,000 gallons
[00:43:23.198 --> 00:43:25.901]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[00:43:25.901 --> 00:43:30.465]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:43:30.465 --> 00:43:32.486]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:43:32.486 --> 00:43:34.628]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[00:43:34.628 --> 00:43:37.431]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:42.535]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:46.138]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:43:46.138 --> 00:43:47.860]  Get it today and it funds the Infowar.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.041]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:56.024]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:43:56.024 --> 00:43:58.486]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:43:59.406 --> 00:44:06.830]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.632]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:44:09.632 --> 00:44:17.997]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:44:17.997 --> 00:44:20.418]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:44:20.418 --> 00:44:23.420]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.301]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:34.706]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[00:44:34.706 --> 00:44:36.567]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:43.170]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:48.835]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:44:48.835 --> 00:44:54.962]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[00:44:54.962 --> 00:44:57.324]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:44:59.178 --> 00:45:04.882]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[00:45:04.882 --> 00:45:07.564]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:45:07.564 --> 00:45:10.186]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:45:10.186 --> 00:45:10.927]  Period.
[00:45:10.927 --> 00:45:12.027]  Case closed.
[00:45:12.027 --> 00:45:13.388]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:45:13.388 --> 00:45:13.869]  We sell.
[00:45:14.389 --> 00:45:21.656]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:45:21.656 --> 00:45:29.242]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[00:45:30.043 --> 00:45:34.405]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:45:34.405 --> 00:45:35.946]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:45:35.946 --> 00:45:38.768]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:45:38.768 --> 00:45:43.991]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:49.474]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:45:49.474 --> 00:45:51.115]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:52.696]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:45:52.696 --> 00:45:54.236]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:45:54.236 --> 00:45:56.878]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[00:45:56.878 --> 00:45:57.998]  They're discounted right now.
[00:45:57.998 --> 00:45:58.719]  Finally back in stock.
[00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:04.951]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4 Store and M4's life not in a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:46:05.407 --> 00:46:06.607]  The answer is simple.
[00:46:06.607 --> 00:46:09.548]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:46:09.548 --> 00:46:13.670]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:19.852]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[00:46:19.852 --> 00:46:25.354]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:46:25.354 --> 00:46:29.595]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:47:01.812 --> 00:47:07.718]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:34.497 --> 00:47:40.621]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up here in the next three hours plus.
[00:47:40.621 --> 00:47:48.105]  Roderick Stone, obviously, responding to Trump getting the word he'll be indicted tomorrow, the next day, by next week, he believes.
[00:47:48.105 --> 00:47:54.249]  Got a statement right here for attacking the Capitol and questioning the election.
[00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:56.090]  And if they can take down a popular U.S.
[00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.492]  president who's 30, 40, 50 points, 70 points ahead of the Republicans,
[00:48:00.558 --> 00:48:01.279]  They can do anything.
[00:48:01.279 --> 00:48:06.142]  I mean, that takes a lot of chutzpah, a lot of balls, a lot of bravado.
[00:48:06.142 --> 00:48:07.784]  But you know what goes before a fall?
[00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:10.166]  Pride.
[00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:25.398]  Then we've got massive Sound of Freedom news with an admitted pedo-apologist that promotes pedophilia for Bloomberg and Rolling Stone and other publications that defends him attacking the movie.
[00:48:25.398 --> 00:48:26.138]  It's like, wow!
[00:48:27.987 --> 00:48:28.847]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:48:28.847 --> 00:48:30.468]  These people are crazy.
[00:48:30.468 --> 00:48:34.569]  But they believe they have all the power, so they're full of bravado.
[00:48:34.569 --> 00:48:37.029]  They're full of hubris, is really the word.
[00:48:37.029 --> 00:48:40.210]  You say chutzpah, bravado, it's hubris.
[00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:43.771]  Let's put the definition of hubris up on screen if we can.
[00:48:43.771 --> 00:48:54.054]  We have incredible pedo news, and incredible globalist sex cult mutilating children news from Admiral Levin and the rest of the freaks.
[00:48:55.819 --> 00:49:00.360]  YouTube officially replaces the American flag emoji with the trans flag.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.200]  So you can't even find the American flag.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.921]  It's about taking our flag down and putting their pedo flag up.
[00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:15.382]  Zelensky Pentagon acknowledges counter offensive had to be paused and that it's been smashed.
[00:49:15.382 --> 00:49:20.083]  We've got mainstream news just lying about the heat wave.
[00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:24.444]  Bright red weather map and fake temperature records drive climate panic.
[00:49:26.634 --> 00:49:28.734]  We have a lot of Fauci news.
[00:49:28.734 --> 00:49:37.716]  As it turns out, he's got illegal presidential-level protection, and the federal marshal's got caught lying, saying the feds weren't paying.
[00:49:37.716 --> 00:49:40.437]  This is a felony.
[00:49:40.437 --> 00:49:47.038]  The federal government's illegally paying for a retired federal employee to have an entire security detail.
[00:49:47.038 --> 00:49:47.858]  It's like Al Capone.
[00:49:47.858 --> 00:49:53.639]  They didn't get him for running murder operations and money laundering and all, but they got him on income tax.
[00:49:55.584 --> 00:49:58.445]  So again, Fauci's a little royal princeling in all this.
[00:49:58.445 --> 00:50:01.526]  He's got hundreds of millions of dollars he stole with all his scams.
[00:50:01.526 --> 00:50:09.449]  The guy's super rich, but why then does he get a full federal marshal detail?
[00:50:09.449 --> 00:50:11.129]  Not to mention all the other crimes he's committed.
[00:50:11.129 --> 00:50:13.010]  That's coming out.
[00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.811]  But let's get into this right now.
[00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:16.631]  Tucker Carlson
[00:50:17.927 --> 00:50:31.311]  Over the weekend, talked to the globalist Trojan horse, fake Christian, fake conservative, in my view, Mike Pence, and said, hey, our cities are collapsing, record suicide, homeless everywhere.
[00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:32.272]  And he said, I don't care.
[00:50:32.272 --> 00:50:34.192]  I'm not worried about that.
[00:50:34.192 --> 00:50:37.493]  That's not even on my mind.
[00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.774]  Because war with Russia is number one.
[00:50:42.608 --> 00:50:44.591]  It's like Pence is under mind control or something.
[00:50:44.591 --> 00:50:50.960]  When you watch the full 30 minute interview, I mean, Pence is just collapsing.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.963]  And he says, that's none of my concern, America.
[00:50:53.962 --> 00:50:58.045]  So our crew put together a little joke video that will actually show you the real raw videos.
[00:50:58.045 --> 00:51:00.226]  This will accuse us of disinfo.
[00:51:00.226 --> 00:51:05.911]  That creature that looked like Zelensky and Pence was not really Zelensky or Pence.
[00:51:05.911 --> 00:51:09.773]  Infowars used a morphing program and deepfake to put them on.
[00:51:09.773 --> 00:51:12.095]  Yes, it's called a joke, a meme.
[00:51:12.095 --> 00:51:16.978]  So whenever we show a meme or a joke now, we then show the raw footage after of what actually happened.
[00:51:16.978 --> 00:51:18.479]  And of course, you know it's a meme.
[00:51:18.479 --> 00:51:19.360]  You know it's a joke.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.401]  They know it's a joke.
[00:51:20.401 --> 00:51:21.642]  It's how they play their games.
[00:51:22.836 --> 00:51:25.298]  They're the ones that put out lies.
[00:51:25.298 --> 00:51:31.842]  You'll read mainstream articles, no quote, no link, no video clip, almost, because they're lying to you.
[00:51:31.842 --> 00:51:40.088]  When we say something, when I say Trump said be peaceful and go to our capital, we show you the clip.
[00:51:40.088 --> 00:51:43.651]  When CNN says Trump said all Hispanics are criminals and bad people.
[00:51:43.651 --> 00:51:44.351]  We're like, where's the clip?
[00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:45.332]  Didn't say anything close to that.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.544]  So a lot of great people coming across the border, but a lot of bad people are coming across illegally.
[00:51:51.544 --> 00:51:53.385]  Rapists, murderers, child traffickers.
[00:51:53.385 --> 00:51:54.046]  It's all true!
[00:51:54.046 --> 00:51:56.128]  I mean, who denies that?
[00:51:56.128 --> 00:52:00.271]  So again, remember how many times they've lied to you.
[00:52:00.271 --> 00:52:05.896]  And never let them condition you to accept their lies and just take their lies.
[00:52:05.896 --> 00:52:08.638]  So here's a little piece we put together.
[00:52:08.638 --> 00:52:10.100]  Tucker told me last night he really liked it.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:10.400]  Here it is.
[00:52:11.391 --> 00:52:27.899]  The economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country most people can't find on a map, who've received tens of billions of U.S.
[00:52:27.899 --> 00:52:29.919]  tax dollars, don't have enough tanks.
[00:52:29.919 --> 00:52:33.941]  I think it's a fair question to ask, like, where's the concern for the United States in that?
[00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:36.883]  Well, it's not my concern.
[00:52:36.883 --> 00:52:39.464]  That's called World War III.
[00:52:41.406 --> 00:52:45.295]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:52:51.918 --> 00:52:57.402]  Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years.
[00:52:57.402 --> 00:52:58.102]  Drive around.
[00:52:58.102 --> 00:53:01.525]  There's not one city that's gotten better in the United States.
[00:53:01.525 --> 00:53:02.945]  And it's visible.
[00:53:02.945 --> 00:53:04.847]  Our economy has degraded.
[00:53:04.847 --> 00:53:06.748]  The suicide rate has jumped.
[00:53:06.748 --> 00:53:10.971]  Public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased.
[00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:19.763]  And yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country most people can't find on a map, who've received tens of billions of U.S.
[00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.784]  tax dollars, don't have enough tanks.
[00:53:21.784 --> 00:53:25.805]  I think it's a fair question to ask, like, where's the concern for the United States in that?
[00:53:25.805 --> 00:53:28.806]  Well, it's not my concern.
[00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:32.847]  Tucker, I've heard that routine from you before, but that's not my concern.
[00:53:32.847 --> 00:53:33.948]  No, no, no, no!
[00:53:35.171 --> 00:53:48.902]  But if I could make some general observations, which I think are more edifying than just, like, savaging Mike Pence, um... I think... Which I'm not gonna do.
[00:53:48.902 --> 00:53:51.424]  Because that would be wrong.
[00:53:51.424 --> 00:53:53.586]  And it would be wrong because it's too easy.
[00:53:53.586 --> 00:53:55.707]  And the easy things are not rewarding, are they?
[00:53:55.707 --> 00:53:59.630]  You don't feel good when you beat your five-year-old in soccer or ping-pong.
[00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:00.111]  Like, what?
[00:54:03.297 --> 00:54:06.898]  Yep, that's ending Mike Pence's career, which he already did being a traitor.
[00:54:06.898 --> 00:54:12.140]  He just puts on that good ol' boy Johnny Quest dad act he does.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:16.622]  The guy is a complete fraud.
[00:54:16.622 --> 00:54:20.123]  In fact, just looking at him, I bet his basement's got some wild stuff in it.
[00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.084]  Probably a big-ass pentagram.
[00:54:22.084 --> 00:54:24.024]  I'm serious.
[00:54:24.024 --> 00:54:25.205]  And he trips to Epstein Island.
[00:54:25.205 --> 00:54:31.887]  How compromised are you that America collapsing, mass suicide, total crime on the streets, none of your concern?
[00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:39.858]  He's heard your routine, Tucker, caring about the country and what the $200 billion sent to Ukraine could have done for this nation.
[00:54:39.858 --> 00:54:43.140]  It's not a routine, Pence!
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.121]  It's called our country going to hell, son!
[00:54:45.121 --> 00:54:47.883]  And you elitists up there playing God!
[00:54:49.824 --> 00:54:51.585]  You are an elite maggot.
[00:54:51.585 --> 00:54:57.228]  All right, speaking of action, the action conference Tucker was at, I need action from you.
[00:54:57.228 --> 00:55:03.072]  The number one thing I'm asking for is prayer for this broadcast and that people be brought to it and have a sermon.
[00:55:03.072 --> 00:55:04.813]  The number two thing is that you bring people.
[00:55:05.333 --> 00:55:07.394]  By sending them and saying, hey, you've heard it's demonized?
[00:55:07.394 --> 00:55:08.375]  You've heard it's attacked?
[00:55:08.375 --> 00:55:09.276]  Let's just tell them the truth.
[00:55:09.276 --> 00:55:10.716]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:55:10.716 --> 00:55:11.637]  Tell them in your email.
[00:55:11.637 --> 00:55:12.558]  Tell them verbally.
[00:55:12.558 --> 00:55:13.698]  Tell them by text message.
[00:55:13.698 --> 00:55:16.000]  Realize the enemy's fighting around the clock to stop that.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.504]  There's even censorship in Google Mail and in WhatsApp on text messages trying to block people promoting InfoWars.
[00:55:22.504 --> 00:55:26.286]  That's because the enemy sees it as the cure to their disease.
[00:55:26.286 --> 00:55:27.067]  So let's share it.
[00:55:28.007 --> 00:55:29.829]  Shareinfowars.com.
[00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:31.130]  Share Bandot videos.
[00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.391]  Share Newswars.com, a backup site.
[00:55:33.391 --> 00:55:35.373]  You ever see Infowars down occasionally under attack?
[00:55:35.373 --> 00:55:37.154]  Newswars will be up, hopefully.
[00:55:37.154 --> 00:55:39.456]  Bandot videos, sometimes you can't share that URL.
[00:55:39.456 --> 00:55:42.478]  Madmaxworld.tv, they haven't blocked that URL yet.
[00:55:42.478 --> 00:55:47.902]  But whatever you do, continue to realize we're in an Infowar, up against AI, up against globalists.
[00:55:47.902 --> 00:55:52.606]  But when you get excited, and you decide to spread the word, nothing can stop you, even separately.
[00:55:52.606 --> 00:55:55.468]  We have been right in the red, right in the black.
[00:55:55.468 --> 00:55:56.509]  We are now into the black.
[00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:04.415]  And I want to go major into the black so that we can get out of this bankruptcy organization and then say, okay, we're going to hire more reporters.
[00:56:04.415 --> 00:56:07.457]  We're going to expand.
[00:56:07.457 --> 00:56:08.838]  And I'm making those arguments right now.
[00:56:08.838 --> 00:56:12.280]  I'm about to make them to the bankruptcy court in like a month.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.281]  Looks like it's going to go through.
[00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:19.885]  We're going to stay on air, but I don't want to just sit here and have some court deal where we just operate and crawl along.
[00:56:19.885 --> 00:56:24.128]  I want to supercharge and I want to expand and build this operation.
[00:56:25.305 --> 00:56:26.226]  That takes funds.
[00:56:26.226 --> 00:56:28.628]  Plus, that's a side issue.
[00:56:28.628 --> 00:56:29.729]  These are great products.
[00:56:29.729 --> 00:56:32.732]  Our Nitric Mist is incredible.
[00:56:32.732 --> 00:56:33.893]  Cleans out your blood.
[00:56:33.893 --> 00:56:34.593]  Highest quality.
[00:56:34.593 --> 00:56:36.515]  You've heard Dr. Minkovitch say how amazing it is?
[00:56:36.515 --> 00:56:37.196]  It's discounted.
[00:56:37.196 --> 00:56:38.577]  Double Patreon points right now.
[00:56:38.577 --> 00:56:41.159]  Up to 60% off on products at Infowarshaw.com.
[00:56:41.159 --> 00:56:43.721]  And then this final point.
[00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:45.243]  It's been three years since we had it.
[00:56:46.325 --> 00:56:47.406]  We got it back in stock.
[00:56:47.406 --> 00:56:49.708]  The amazing 30 parts per million.
[00:56:49.708 --> 00:56:53.511]  Highest quality colloidal silver in all the great things and all the great uses.
[00:56:53.511 --> 00:56:54.512]  Back in stock.
[00:56:54.512 --> 00:56:55.793]  Limited supply.
[00:56:55.793 --> 00:56:58.095]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:58.095 --> 00:56:59.316]  30% off.
[00:56:59.316 --> 00:57:04.561]  And it's a very limited supply, but we have it back.
[00:57:04.561 --> 00:57:05.942]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:05.942 --> 00:57:07.263]  Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[00:57:07.263 --> 00:57:11.446]  The Infowars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has returned.
[00:57:11.446 --> 00:57:12.768]  Silver Bullet is the answer.
[00:57:13.834 --> 00:57:26.363]  To Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product that utilizes high-quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.
[00:57:26.363 --> 00:57:27.664]  It is amazing.
[00:57:27.664 --> 00:57:30.746]  It's got thousands of reviews, five-star reviews.
[00:57:30.746 --> 00:57:33.308]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:33.308 --> 00:57:36.491]  Silver Bullet returns to InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:43.076]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[00:57:43.076 --> 00:57:45.118]  Because they're all about to sell out.
[00:57:45.118 --> 00:57:49.662]  And krill oil's amazing as well.
[00:57:49.662 --> 00:58:04.575]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:06.696]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:58:06.696 --> 00:58:09.676]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:58:09.676 --> 00:58:11.297]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:58:11.297 --> 00:58:16.218]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:58:16.218 --> 00:58:17.959]  This is something you need now.
[00:58:17.959 --> 00:58:22.520]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:28.242]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[00:58:28.242 --> 00:58:34.404]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[00:58:34.784 --> 00:58:37.586]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:58:37.586 --> 00:58:38.926]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:38.926 --> 00:58:41.127]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:58:41.127 --> 00:58:45.310]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:09.000]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:15.884]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:59:15.884 --> 00:59:16.805]  It's really just incredible.
[00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:20.706]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:20.706 --> 00:59:27.249]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:59:27.249 --> 00:59:30.270]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:38.513]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:59:39.213 --> 00:59:43.515]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[00:59:43.515 --> 00:59:48.457]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:48.457 --> 00:59:51.558]  Please take action now.
[00:59:51.558 --> 00:59:57.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.538 --> 01:00:13.561]  Congress, do the right thing.
[01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:40.004]  And only count the electors who have been lawfully slated.
[01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:42.566]  Lawfully slated.
[01:00:42.566 --> 01:00:51.593]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.
[01:00:51.593 --> 01:01:01.800]  Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections, but whether or not they stand strong for our country.
[01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:06.028]  We need to peacefully march to the Capitol.
[01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:22.746]  Thank you.
[01:01:41.621 --> 01:01:43.603]  Well, Alex, I don't want to speculate.
[01:01:43.603 --> 01:02:08.462]  We obviously don't know whether they are seeking to charge the former president regarding the riot at the Capitol, although that would seem to me, based on what I've read, to be outside the scope of Mr. Smith's investigation, and that's, generally speaking, being prosecuted by others, or whether it is a challenge to the electors in certain states
[01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:21.426]  Very famously, John Kennedy filed a slate of alternative electors in Hawaii in 1960 when there was a dispute about the outcome in that state.
[01:02:21.426 --> 01:02:27.428]  That was, of course, not considered to be unconstitutional or illegal or treasonous.
[01:02:27.428 --> 01:02:28.948]  So there is some precedent for that.
[01:02:28.948 --> 01:02:34.810]  But we don't really know enough about what they intend to try to
[01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:40.412]  Bring against the president, other than to say it really is unprecedented.
[01:02:40.412 --> 01:02:43.013]  He is a candidate for the White House.
[01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:44.373]  He is leading Joe Biden.
[01:02:44.373 --> 01:02:47.174]  That is what's got them petrified.
[01:02:47.174 --> 01:03:02.299]  Biden is snared up in an extortion, money laundering, influence peddling, illegal lobbying, treasonous scandal for which there's far more hard evidence than there ever was.
[01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:07.764]  But forward regarding President Trump in the two phony impeachments.
[01:03:07.764 --> 01:03:09.305]  So what did they do?
[01:03:09.305 --> 01:03:14.528]  They go out and they seek to remove Donald Trump from the equation.
[01:03:14.528 --> 01:03:17.930]  It is only a conviction, Alex.
[01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:26.473]  For violation of the Constitution pertaining to insurrection that would make him ineligible to be a candidate.
[01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:33.015]  And as long as he is legally eligible to be a candidate, he will never give up the fight.
[01:03:33.015 --> 01:03:46.620]  So perhaps, perhaps that is the game plan here to try to take him out of contention because they already know they cannot beat him in a free, fair, honest, transparent election.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.381]  Well, what you just said is huge.
[01:03:48.381 --> 01:03:51.745]  I just think you said we can't speculate, but I don't think there's any speculation.
[01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:58.391]  None of their other kangaroo charges, alternate electors, which the Democrats called for just a few elections ago.
[01:03:58.391 --> 01:03:59.512]  Kennedy used it.
[01:03:59.512 --> 01:04:01.534]  It's all there.
[01:04:01.534 --> 01:04:03.816]  Trump went with standard stuff.
[01:04:03.816 --> 01:04:04.777]  They think the public's dumb.
[01:04:05.798 --> 01:04:09.861]  Obviously, they want the insurrection clause so they can preclude him.
[01:04:09.861 --> 01:04:17.567]  The question is, can they indict him, have a kangaroo trial quick enough to then claim that he's precluded before he wins in a landslide?
[01:04:17.567 --> 01:04:21.609]  That's the $64 quadrillion question.
[01:04:21.609 --> 01:04:24.832]  We're going to cover that when we come back in detail.
[01:04:24.832 --> 01:04:26.433]  What else are you going to be breaking down?
[01:04:29.102 --> 01:04:29.442]  It is.
[01:04:29.442 --> 01:04:33.468]  I must tell you, the president is absolutely at the top of his game.
[01:04:33.468 --> 01:04:37.593]  I was with him in Palm Beach on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:42.099]  I've never seen him in this fighting mode.
[01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:45.324]  I mean, he's given everything on his shoulders.
[01:04:45.324 --> 01:04:46.065]  He's relaxed.
[01:04:46.585 --> 01:04:47.746]  He's determined.
[01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:49.147]  He's confident.
[01:04:49.147 --> 01:04:52.990]  He's really at his best under crisis.
[01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:55.352]  He's at his best when under fire.
[01:04:55.352 --> 01:04:57.113]  He really is a warrior.
[01:04:57.113 --> 01:04:59.275]  A lesser man would have thrown in a child.
[01:05:00.114 --> 01:05:06.476]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:05:06.476 --> 01:05:12.918]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:05:12.918 --> 01:05:16.259]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:05:16.259 --> 01:05:25.422]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:25.882]  Look it up.
[01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:27.882]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:31.103]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:05:31.103 --> 01:05:34.244]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[01:05:34.244 --> 01:05:36.564]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:05:36.564 --> 01:05:39.005]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:05:39.005 --> 01:05:40.785]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:05:40.785 --> 01:05:41.766]  It is amazing.
[01:05:41.766 --> 01:05:43.406]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:46.627]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:05:46.627 --> 01:05:48.047]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:05:48.047 --> 01:05:51.808]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[01:05:52.068 --> 01:05:54.491]  Get yours today at importworkstore.com for a limited time.
[01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:56.094]  We're running a 10% discount.
[01:05:56.094 --> 01:05:57.055]  That is a huge discount.
[01:05:57.055 --> 01:05:58.477]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:05:58.477 --> 01:05:59.138]  You need this filter.
[01:06:10.353 --> 01:06:26.986]  Free country, whether you will have a rule of tyrants or the rule of law, whether Marxist radicals burn our civilization to the ground, which they're looking to do, or young patriots like you propel America to glorious new heights greater than ever before.
[01:06:26.986 --> 01:06:30.169]  Side by side, we're going to fight and we're going to win.
[01:06:30.169 --> 01:06:37.694]  We have no choice, actually.
[01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.236]  We're going to evict
[01:06:40.387 --> 01:06:41.268]  Crooked Joe Biden.
[01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:43.632]  You know, I took the name off of Hillary.
[01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:44.434]  You know that, right?
[01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:45.575]  Everybody here knows that.
[01:06:45.575 --> 01:06:46.497]  It was Crooked Hillary.
[01:06:46.497 --> 01:06:49.081]  It was very successful.
[01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:50.523]  But I think she's out of it now.
[01:06:52.011 --> 01:06:57.195]  But no, I thought it was more appropriate because he's crooked, as you can get.
[01:06:57.195 --> 01:07:00.577]  This is the most dishonest president in history.
[01:07:00.577 --> 01:07:01.558]  And I wouldn't have said it.
[01:07:01.558 --> 01:07:06.001]  You know, I have I have pride in the presidency and respect for the presidency.
[01:07:06.001 --> 01:07:07.462]  I wouldn't have said it.
[01:07:07.462 --> 01:07:13.327]  But I say things about him over the last three weeks that I would have never said before about any president.
[01:07:13.327 --> 01:07:17.170]  He is a corrupt, horrible, incompetent man.
[01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.691]  And he's destroying our country.
[01:07:18.691 --> 01:07:20.192]  And we have to have it changed.
[01:07:23.271 --> 01:07:27.833]  With God's help, we're going to save America on November 5th, 2024.
[01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:34.097]  And when I said originally in 2016, it's the most important election, I meant that this is far more important.
[01:07:34.097 --> 01:07:37.979]  This is far more important because our country is ready to go down.
[01:07:39.187 --> 01:07:43.068]  Ready to go possibly into World War III and this won't be a war like others.
[01:07:43.068 --> 01:07:46.369]  This will be a nuclear war and the level of destruction.
[01:07:46.369 --> 01:07:47.810]  It's called obliteration.
[01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:52.051]  It's not two army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other.
[01:07:52.051 --> 01:07:59.954]  This is big stuff and we have a man who's grossly incompetent, who doesn't even know where he is, who can't put two sentences... This is not HBO.
[01:07:59.954 --> 01:08:01.134]  This is not Netflix.
[01:08:01.134 --> 01:08:02.354]  This is the real world.
[01:08:02.354 --> 01:08:03.775]  July 2023, edge of nuclear war.
[01:08:07.336 --> 01:08:13.497]  A psychotic, drug addict, pedophile, and his son running the country under CHICOM control.
[01:08:13.497 --> 01:08:21.139]  A literal lunatic, UN prosecutor, Jack Smith, preparing to indict Trump.
[01:08:21.139 --> 01:08:24.840]  Trump's put out a letter saying, when they send you this letter, you're a target.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.520]  It almost always means you're being indicted.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.540]  He says his indictment is imminent.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:34.562]  Told to report within four days to the puppet grand jury in the rigged system of DC.
[01:08:34.562 --> 01:08:36.682]  This is just so wild.
[01:08:37.921 --> 01:08:50.671]  Incredibly dangerous, and Roger Stone joins us, who just spent two days with the President, and was just saying earlier, if a station just joined us, that Trump is energized like never before.
[01:08:50.671 --> 01:08:55.475]  Well, you can see it in these clips, but elaborate on that and how big a constitutional crisis this is.
[01:08:55.475 --> 01:08:57.877]  I mean, this is election meddling.
[01:08:57.877 --> 01:08:59.098]  Imagine a Republican
[01:08:59.738 --> 01:09:00.299]  I don't know.
[01:09:20.598 --> 01:09:21.480]  Yes, we are.
[01:09:33.678 --> 01:09:39.859]  Which we know they wanted to indict you and I. Washington Post two weeks ago reported claiming we were being ordered by Trump to attack the Capitol.
[01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.699]  All of it totally made it preposterous.
[01:09:41.699 --> 01:09:44.580]  For me, it is otherworldly.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.540]  I feel like I'm in a dream right now, Roger.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.681]  Like, I'm pinching myself.
[01:09:47.681 --> 01:09:49.861]  Like, am I really talking to his top advisor?
[01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:53.201]  Did this all really just... Are they really trying to frame us right now?
[01:09:53.201 --> 01:09:56.102]  And the answer is, yeah, we testified to Congress, both of us.
[01:09:56.102 --> 01:09:57.982]  You know, had to tell them, no, we didn't attack the Capitol.
[01:09:57.982 --> 01:09:59.203]  You weren't even there.
[01:09:59.203 --> 01:10:01.603]  I mean, this is just surreal, Roger Stone.
[01:10:03.126 --> 01:10:10.592]  Yeah, it's Kafka-esque, you're absolutely right, but it just demonstrates what an existential threat Donald Trump is to the established order.
[01:10:10.592 --> 01:10:14.516]  He is a disruptor, and they can't have that.
[01:10:14.516 --> 01:10:26.546]  They're trying to move the country as briskly to World War III as they can, while Joe Biden and the members of his family line their own pockets with multi-million dollar payments from
[01:10:26.906 --> 01:10:29.527]  Foreign governments and entities.
[01:10:29.527 --> 01:10:35.809]  So, you know, this is all coming down very, very quickly because the calendar is crucial.
[01:10:35.809 --> 01:10:54.075]  You know, it has always been clear to me that they would seek to charge Trump in the District of Columbia, where the system is so broken that no Republican, no conservative, no free thinker, no non-liberal Democrat can get a fair trial under any circumstances.
[01:10:54.455 --> 01:11:08.243]  And when I see these lawyers on TV making cogent arguments, please understand, in D.C., the law, the Constitution, the rules, the facts, the evidence, none of these things matter.
[01:11:08.243 --> 01:11:13.206]  In my case, I had a jury forewoman who testified in jury selection.
[01:11:13.206 --> 01:11:14.527]  She didn't know who I was.
[01:11:14.527 --> 01:11:16.028]  She knew nothing about my case.
[01:11:16.696 --> 01:11:23.702]  But she had been attacking me on Twitter and Facebook for a year before she was chosen as a juror in my case.
[01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:33.010]  She kept those attacks on me and on Donald Trump on a private setting and then tried to quietly delete them after the trial.
[01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:36.452]  And the judge actually ruled that none of that was evidence of bias.
[01:11:36.452 --> 01:11:40.656]  So the rule book, the Constitution, the law, these things are out the window.
[01:11:41.136 --> 01:11:47.477]  Which is why Mr. Smith is so anxious to find some charge in the District of Columbia.
[01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:51.498]  The charges pending against the president in Florida are important.
[01:11:51.498 --> 01:11:57.820]  It's a flawed case, as Trump has pointed out, under the Presidential Records Act.
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:04.121]  As decided by the judge in my case, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, a president can do whatever he wants with the records.
[01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:08.422]  Uh, but more importantly... Yeah, Roger, let's not even defend Trump.
[01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:09.863]  Everybody knows he's innocent.
[01:12:09.863 --> 01:12:11.445]  Everyone knows you're innocent.
[01:12:11.445 --> 01:12:12.406]  I don't need to believe you.
[01:12:12.406 --> 01:12:15.269]  I was there saying, I'll give you a job at InfoWars.
[01:12:15.269 --> 01:12:16.890]  I'm not acting powerful, but you wanted one.
[01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:18.312]  Well, you got one later anyways.
[01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:20.193]  If you'll get me Julian Assange.
[01:12:20.193 --> 01:12:22.916]  You said, well, I know this Randy Credico guy that talks to him.
[01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:24.097]  I'm going to try to get him on the show.
[01:12:24.818 --> 01:12:29.420]  And then, and then, and then Assange was on TV saying, it's Hillary's, it's gonna hurt Hillary.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.401]  And you're like, I hear it's gonna hurt Hillary.
[01:12:31.401 --> 01:12:36.123]  And off of that, they indicted and convicted you for running WikiLeaks?
[01:12:36.123 --> 01:12:37.443]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:12:37.443 --> 01:12:40.764]  Julian Assange was all over TV then.
[01:12:40.764 --> 01:12:43.465]  Yeah, it's, I'm not trying to rehash my own case.
[01:12:43.465 --> 01:12:47.027]  No, I mean, but it was crazy because they convicted you for nothing.
[01:12:48.055 --> 01:12:56.361]  But here's an important point, and that is, there were challenges to the legitimacy of Robert Mueller's appointment in D.C.
[01:12:56.361 --> 01:13:08.090]  He was never confirmed by the Congress, and for a number of other constitutional reasons, absent a special counsel law, which we do not have in place right now, he never had the authority to prosecute anyone.
[01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:11.212]  That was wrongly decided in the District of Columbia.
[01:13:11.212 --> 01:13:15.576]  When Trump's lawyers, who I have minimal confidence in, in all honesty,
[01:13:16.096 --> 01:13:21.201]  At least his current legal team filed their response to the court.
[01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:27.568]  They did have a marker in there that allows them to question the legitimacy of Jack Smith's appointment.
[01:13:27.568 --> 01:13:39.000]  I expect that, I hope that, will be a major thrust of their defense in Florida, because if it were found to be true in Florida, it would knock out Mr. Smith's authority in New York.
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.401]  I don't know.
[01:13:54.697 --> 01:14:08.891]  This case had to be brought, the documents case had to be brought in Florida because under the constitutional decision by the Supreme Court, the case against you must be brought in the jurisdiction where the crime allegedly took place.
[01:14:08.891 --> 01:14:13.656]  And then just through the hand of God, Donald Trump got an honest judge.
[01:14:13.656 --> 01:14:15.357]  Yeah, it's a judge he appointed.
[01:14:15.357 --> 01:14:15.878]  So what?
[01:14:16.434 --> 01:14:25.239]  You had no problem with me being tried by an activist Democrat left-wing judge appointed by Barack Obama.
[01:14:25.239 --> 01:14:26.899]  You had no problem with that.
[01:14:26.899 --> 01:14:38.345]  So they're apoplectic that Trump might actually get a fair trial, will probably be acquitted in Florida, which is why they have to do this Andrew Weissman dictation.
[01:14:38.345 --> 01:14:40.246]  No, no, I totally agree, but let's pull back to 100,000 feet here.
[01:14:43.194 --> 01:14:46.315]  You don't need to be a rocket scientist, but you are when it comes to politics.
[01:14:46.315 --> 01:15:00.138]  What does this do if New York boosted Trump 10 points, the federal indictment 15, 20 points, 75 points in polls now ahead of all Republicans in the field, 20, 30 points ahead of Biden?
[01:15:00.138 --> 01:15:03.759]  I think it's fair to say he's as popular as George Washington was in 1789.
[01:15:03.759 --> 01:15:04.379]  I don't know how
[01:15:08.729 --> 01:15:13.851]  They think they're going to follow through with this, but how do you expect this with the timing to play out?
[01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:16.612]  Clear election meddling, clearly trying to block who we want.
[01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.912]  The public sees it.
[01:15:18.912 --> 01:15:21.973]  I go out in public, you go out in public, I've got nothing but love now.
[01:15:21.973 --> 01:15:23.194]  The worm has really turned.
[01:15:23.194 --> 01:15:35.118]  I think Jack Smith and Merrick Garland and their little bubbles don't get this, but how do you see this unfolding as they try to convict the obvious mega frontrunner
[01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:38.562]  I mean, I don't see them getting away with this.
[01:15:38.562 --> 01:15:41.024]  This is crazy.
[01:15:41.024 --> 01:15:47.409]  Well, first of all, I wasn't alive in 1789, and I categorically deny that I was the head of youth for Washington.
[01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.910]  But putting that aside...
[01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:50.709]  No, I think you're right.
[01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:52.370]  It's a massive miscalculation.
[01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:53.950]  Look, we've seen this before.
[01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:59.674]  Jimmy Carter and his top advisors wanted to run against Ronald Reagan, thought he would be easy to beat.
[01:15:59.674 --> 01:16:07.618]  Hillary Clinton and her corrupt advisors wanted to get run against Donald Trump, thought he would be the easiest candidate to beat.
[01:16:07.618 --> 01:16:11.720]  I expect Trump will take a further advance in his poll ratings.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.882]  He's going to become even more popular, if that's possible.
[01:16:15.602 --> 01:16:20.304]  Because I've never seen poll numbers like this, and I've been doing this for 45 years.
[01:16:20.304 --> 01:16:25.746]  He's more popular than the great Ronald Reagan, and Reagan was very, very, very popular.
[01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:34.949]  The intensity of Trump's support is going to be further galvanized, and he's going to take in millions of dollars more in small and medium-sized contributions.
[01:16:34.949 --> 01:16:38.830]  Meanwhile, the candidacy of his various challengers, including Governor DeSantis, are
[01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:48.995]  On the verge of collapse if they haven't already collapsed as most Republicans, many Americans, particularly independents, rally behind the president.
[01:16:48.995 --> 01:16:52.057]  So that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
[01:16:52.057 --> 01:16:56.559]  I think Nietzsche said that, but it's a perfect example of what's going on here.
[01:16:56.559 --> 01:17:07.605]  Every time they charge Trump with another fabricated crime in an effort to cheat in the next election or not have a next election that involves Donald Trump.
[01:17:07.905 --> 01:17:11.488]  They're only boosting his strength, and he will use it.
[01:17:11.488 --> 01:17:12.969]  So I totally agree.
[01:17:12.969 --> 01:17:19.435]  So how do you see these waves, this giant populist wave coming in that's way bigger than the left, but they've got the Justice Department.
[01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:21.016]  They still think they're going to do it.
[01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:24.299]  Don't they see that that is just destroying them?
[01:17:24.299 --> 01:17:25.780]  So they've got to have some plan.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:27.322]  I think it's false flag terror.
[01:17:27.322 --> 01:17:33.007]  I think they blow up buildings after they indict Trump and say a Trump supporter blows up federal buildings.
[01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.189]  Or something like that.
[01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:37.591]  Schools, you name it, for Trump.
[01:17:37.591 --> 01:17:39.433]  In fact, I don't think I know.
[01:17:39.433 --> 01:17:40.815]  Clinton did that in 95.
[01:17:40.815 --> 01:17:46.180]  He credited on Air Force One to the whole media that Oklahoma City saved him.
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:47.402]  It was 15 points behind.
[01:17:47.402 --> 01:17:50.405]  I think they're going to false flag stuff and blame Trump supporters.
[01:17:51.823 --> 01:17:59.627]  Well, Alex, this is a very, very key point because I'm sure right now across the country there are many, many Americans who are very, very upset.
[01:17:59.627 --> 01:18:01.287]  That's part of the plan, folks.
[01:18:01.287 --> 01:18:04.729]  They want to goad you into doing something stupid.
[01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:08.030]  They want to goad you into breaking the law or
[01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:09.811]  We're good.
[01:18:30.392 --> 01:18:31.654]  How do we respond to that ahead of time?
[01:18:31.654 --> 01:18:32.796]  Because you know it's coming.
[01:18:32.796 --> 01:18:36.463]  I'd say 95% chance, truck bombs, mass shootings.
[01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:38.787]  Blamed on Trump, blamed on you, blamed on me.
[01:18:38.787 --> 01:18:41.692]  I would say right after he's indicted.
[01:18:41.692 --> 01:18:42.033]  What do you think?
[01:18:43.289 --> 01:18:48.191]  This is the importance of Infowars remaining the force and the voice that it is.
[01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:52.792]  This is why it's so vitally important that we have alternative media in this country.
[01:18:52.792 --> 01:19:01.395]  Because when we try to defend ourselves and we try to correct the record, trust me, the folks at MSNBC and CNN and CBS and ABC and NBC,
[01:19:01.975 --> 01:19:05.958]  And the New York Times and the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal simply won't cover it.
[01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:07.419]  They won't cover it.
[01:19:07.419 --> 01:19:13.983]  You agree that minus them doing a false flag, these attacks on populism and who we want and our president won't work.
[01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:18.947]  I'm just saying, how else are they going to do this when it's destroying them and get away with it?
[01:19:18.947 --> 01:19:20.788]  I don't see how else.
[01:19:20.788 --> 01:19:21.949]  Another war?
[01:19:21.949 --> 01:19:22.769]  A power outage?
[01:19:22.769 --> 01:19:23.970]  A meteorite?
[01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:29.294]  How do they change the subject from the persecution of who we want and who our president is?
[01:19:29.654 --> 01:19:32.316]  How do they grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:19:32.316 --> 01:19:34.137]  Roger Stone.
[01:19:34.137 --> 01:19:45.785]  The people who are capable of covering up the finding of a bag of cocaine in one of the most heavily surveilled places on earth, the White House, are capable of anything.
[01:19:45.785 --> 01:19:50.929]  And therefore, I think their guess is that if they can just eliminate Trump,
[01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:54.592]  They can railroad anything they want through the D.C.
[01:19:54.592 --> 01:20:05.201]  courts, including his incarceration, and they know that the people will not, based on what they've seen January 6th, be able to do anything lest they too be crushed and incarcerated.
[01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:07.923]  We don't advocate that, by the way, just to be clear.
[01:20:09.063 --> 01:20:09.923]  It's a power play.
[01:20:09.923 --> 01:20:11.864]  It's the ultimate power play.
[01:20:11.864 --> 01:20:15.665]  Once they got power, they never intended to relinquish it.
[01:20:15.665 --> 01:20:18.566]  And therefore, they are capable of absolutely anything.
[01:20:18.566 --> 01:20:31.349]  People who will charge a former President of the United States, who is the leading candidate for President, leading in the polls by, as he would say, a lot, will do absolutely anything to cling to power and money.
[01:20:31.349 --> 01:20:35.150]  And as I said at the conference on Sunday,
[01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:37.011]  I still believe.
[01:20:37.011 --> 01:20:43.256]  I still absolutely believe that it is their intention to give Joe Biden the hook.
[01:20:43.256 --> 01:20:44.437]  The guy can't stand up.
[01:20:44.437 --> 01:20:45.878]  He's not coherent.
[01:20:45.878 --> 01:20:47.520]  He's embarrassing them.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.702]  And his thievery is now there for everybody to see.
[01:20:50.702 --> 01:20:55.366]  It's one of the reasons they chose him, by the way, is because they had the goods on him and they knew they could control him.
[01:20:56.006 --> 01:20:58.128]  He just mentally degraded faster than they thought.
[01:20:58.128 --> 01:21:04.132]  So they wanted to have him there to blame for their criminality, to control him, to flush him, but he's rotted so bad they've got to get rid of him.
[01:21:04.132 --> 01:21:06.534]  And you say, you still say, you've been vindicated.
[01:21:06.534 --> 01:21:15.840]  You were on my show three years ago during the campaign when I got banned again on Facebook even more as a dangerous person for saying he's obviously had a stroke or something wrong.
[01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:28.418]  And you said all of this at the time, what Biden was going to do, what he was going to carry out, and that they would then replace him with Big Mike or Gavin Newsom.
[01:21:28.418 --> 01:21:29.919]  You say you're still saying it.
[01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:34.882]  Now there's op-eds in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, everywhere saying, we got to get rid of Biden.
[01:21:34.882 --> 01:21:35.823]  How does he step down?
[01:21:35.823 --> 01:21:36.603]  Politico.
[01:21:36.603 --> 01:21:37.564]  He's got to go.
[01:21:37.564 --> 01:21:39.945]  And they're clearly trying to give him the hook.
[01:21:39.945 --> 01:21:46.010]  But I'm told Jill Biden, like you said, likes the parties and all of it too much, that he's now holding on
[01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:53.068]  Like a, like a, you know, old cicada on a tree in the wintertime before he blows away.
[01:21:53.068 --> 01:21:54.132]  How do you see that unfolding?
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.841]  Well, first of all, I think Dr. Jill's not going to go easily.
[01:21:57.841 --> 01:22:04.242]  I mean, she wouldn't have access then to the curtains and tablecloths that she uses to make her clothing, quite obviously.
[01:22:04.242 --> 01:22:12.364]  And Joe Biden has endless supply of children that he can sniff and otherwise, you know, nuzzle.
[01:22:12.364 --> 01:22:13.205]  What do you call that?
[01:22:13.205 --> 01:22:14.925]  A video still blows my mind.
[01:22:14.925 --> 01:22:16.345]  No, he raves them with his nose.
[01:22:16.345 --> 01:22:18.246]  It's disgusting.
[01:22:18.246 --> 01:22:18.866]  I mean, they're not...
[01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:32.956]  Not going to go easily but they will go because in the end if he refuses to go he will be removed under the 25th amendment which only requires a majority of the cabinet and the acquiescence of the sitting vice president.
[01:22:32.956 --> 01:22:34.277]  Barack Obama could orchestrate
[01:22:35.322 --> 01:22:37.784]  In an afternoon, in an afternoon.
[01:22:37.784 --> 01:22:46.010]  And then Joe wouldn't have the opportunity to pardon himself and his brother and his son and other members of the Biden crime family.
[01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:48.471]  Now, Alex, this is a key point.
[01:22:48.471 --> 01:22:58.979]  When it was speculated that Trump was going to pardon himself for some unspecified crime before leaving office, lunatics like Lawrence tried, the worst lawyer in America.
[01:22:59.299 --> 01:23:02.804]  Nothing this guy says is accurate or true.
[01:23:02.804 --> 01:23:04.306]  He's embarrassing.
[01:23:04.306 --> 01:23:08.071]  Oh, Trump doesn't have the authority to pardon himself, but watch.
[01:23:08.071 --> 01:23:16.401]  When Joe Biden pardons himself, every left-wing legal scholar in the world will be telling you, oh, it's perfectly constitutional.
[01:23:16.401 --> 01:23:16.702]  Watch.
[01:23:18.354 --> 01:23:27.660]  Is the system so static and so stagnant that perhaps Biden is just able to stay in control because he is the puppet president?
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:40.107]  And imagine by the time he is inaugurated again via fraud or killing Trump or assassinating him or whatever they're going to do or putting him in prison, that we literally have a president that isn't seen and can't talk, kind of like Woodrow Wilson?
[01:23:41.673 --> 01:23:52.077]  Well, Wilson was only able to get away with that because at the times we had no mass media and therefore the only people that were ever seen were his wife and Colonel House, his major handler.
[01:23:52.077 --> 01:23:57.939]  But he, you know, she would actually put the pen in his hand and move it to sign important documents.
[01:23:57.939 --> 01:24:08.102]  Joe Biden's problem is that he really doesn't have the power because were he to give any order whatsoever, none of the people around him, all of whom are loyal to and actually work for Barack Obama,
[01:24:08.382 --> 01:24:10.863]  Would carry out those orders.
[01:24:10.863 --> 01:24:12.343]  So, I think he's cooked.
[01:24:12.343 --> 01:24:13.764]  I think he's done.
[01:24:13.764 --> 01:24:17.465]  I kind of feel sorry for him because at this point it's elder abuse.
[01:24:17.465 --> 01:24:22.227]  It's time for him to retire to the beach in Rehoboth.
[01:24:22.227 --> 01:24:26.449]  If he pardons himself, he'll still have all that money that he and his son stole.
[01:24:26.449 --> 01:24:29.370]  He really ought to ride off into the sunset if he were smart.
[01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:32.031]  But the Obamas play for keeps.
[01:24:32.031 --> 01:24:35.272]  If he won't go along, if he won't resign quietly,
[01:24:35.952 --> 01:24:42.499]  Uh, then they will actually, I think, remove him because they cannot possibly pull off an election with him at the helm.
[01:24:42.499 --> 01:24:53.091]  If you went into election day and he's trailing by 10 points, which is entirely possible, it's going to be very hard to convince people when you steal the election that the election wasn't stolen.
[01:24:53.211 --> 01:24:57.392]  Well, the last thing I want is anything to happen to Obama's third term.
[01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.232]  Violent, because that'll make them victims.
[01:24:59.232 --> 01:25:01.513]  But Joe Biden is a total puppet.
[01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.093]  Some people say, oh, what about Kamala?
[01:25:03.093 --> 01:25:06.594]  She's completely drugged out of her head, even dumber than Biden.
[01:25:06.594 --> 01:25:11.575]  Some people would say, oh, the elite doesn't want her in there as president, don't know what they're talking about.
[01:25:11.575 --> 01:25:19.097]  But I'm really concerned about them assassinating Biden, recycling him to then say a Trump supporter killed him.
[01:25:19.617 --> 01:25:22.318]  I mean, I think that's a perfect scripting for them.
[01:25:22.318 --> 01:25:23.998]  I'm very concerned about that.
[01:25:23.998 --> 01:25:27.419]  So I pray for Joe Biden.
[01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:30.140]  That actually sent a shiver up my spine, Alex.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.980]  Look, I think these people are capable of absolutely anything.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.441]  We don't wish any ill will on Joe Biden.
[01:25:35.441 --> 01:25:38.882]  I just like him to step aside and live out his years in peace.
[01:25:38.882 --> 01:25:40.462]  I don't think he's going to do that.
[01:25:40.462 --> 01:25:47.404]  But if they remove him, they are now stuck with their own hand-picked choice for vice president, Kamala Harris.
[01:25:48.104 --> 01:25:52.807]  She doesn't have senile dementia, but she makes even less sense than Joe Biden.
[01:25:52.807 --> 01:26:09.757]  So therefore, I have said the only way within the current modern Democratic Party, which will not nominate a white male for president again in our lifetimes, is to replace a woman of color, Kamala Harris, with a more popular woman of color, Michelle Obama.
[01:26:09.757 --> 01:26:12.779]  They can raise the $100 million they need overnight.
[01:26:12.779 --> 01:26:14.800]  So you really think it's going to be Big Mike?
[01:26:16.184 --> 01:26:18.945]  I really think it will be Michelle Obama, yes.
[01:26:18.945 --> 01:26:21.267]  Just say Big Mike.
[01:26:21.267 --> 01:26:29.951]  I don't mean to speculate about Michelle Obama's sexual orientation on your show, for period.
[01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:31.212]  Will you say Mike Tyson's Big Mike?
[01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.790]  Mike Tyson
[01:26:52.103 --> 01:26:53.084]  Oh, let's bring up that.
[01:26:53.084 --> 01:26:55.525]  I love the callers that think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:26:55.525 --> 01:26:56.585]  is a Trojan horse.
[01:26:56.585 --> 01:26:58.026]  He may be wrong on some policies.
[01:26:58.026 --> 01:26:59.126]  He's his own guy.
[01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:01.908]  Just like Trump, he runs his own life.
[01:27:01.908 --> 01:27:02.928]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'
[01:27:02.908 --> 01:27:06.550]  's father and uncle were murdered by the Deep State.
[01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:09.051]  I don't see any way he works for them.
[01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:10.132]  What do you say?
[01:27:10.132 --> 01:27:10.932]  I say he's out to get them.
[01:27:12.246 --> 01:27:12.906]  Zero chance.
[01:27:12.906 --> 01:27:13.927]  He's a free thinker.
[01:27:13.927 --> 01:27:17.828]  He has identified who murdered his father and his uncle.
[01:27:17.828 --> 01:27:20.509]  He wants to seal our southern border.
[01:27:20.509 --> 01:27:22.409]  He is for health freedom.
[01:27:22.409 --> 01:27:26.531]  He's against this insane rush to war in Ukraine.
[01:27:26.531 --> 01:27:27.751]  On many issues, I agree with him.
[01:27:27.751 --> 01:27:31.132]  On the other hand, he believes in climate.
[01:27:31.132 --> 01:27:33.873]  So if he's the Democrat nominee, you're going to support Trump?
[01:27:35.245 --> 01:27:37.167]  I'm supporting Trump no matter what.
[01:27:37.167 --> 01:27:40.029]  It's ride or die with Donald Trump for me.
[01:27:40.029 --> 01:27:43.252]  But I like Robert Kennedy because he's unafraid.
[01:27:43.252 --> 01:27:49.197]  Because he challenges the left-wing orthodoxy on some of the most important issues in the country.
[01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:51.499]  I don't agree with him when it comes to abortion.
[01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:54.061]  He is pro-abortion, I'm pro-life.
[01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:56.203]  I don't agree with him about the climate hoax.
[01:27:56.903 --> 01:27:59.104]  Well, now he's saying the climate things and power grabs.
[01:27:59.104 --> 01:28:00.564]  He's moving towards us.
[01:28:00.564 --> 01:28:01.664]  The system hates him.
[01:28:01.664 --> 01:28:02.684]  30 seconds left.
[01:28:02.684 --> 01:28:04.905]  Roger Stone, you host a weekday show.
[01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:07.086]  You've got a very popular WNBC show.
[01:28:07.086 --> 01:28:09.786]  Tell people how we find everything Roger Stone.
[01:28:09.786 --> 01:28:16.848]  Sure, go to stonezone.live every day at 5 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Central for my daily show.
[01:28:16.848 --> 01:28:24.610]  Today I have Colby Covington, the UFC champion, who's headed to a big, big fight at Madison Square Garden for the championship.
[01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:33.192]  Today at StoneZone.live at 4 o'clock Central, 5 o'clock Eastern, and just go to StoneZone.com.
[01:28:33.192 --> 01:28:34.632]  StoneZone.com.
[01:28:34.632 --> 01:28:48.916]  You can see all my videos, read what I have written, and go by the store and get yourself a copy of The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ, or your Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong t-shirt, or your epically hysterical Roger Stone.
[01:28:49.096 --> 01:28:49.737]  Go there now.
[01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:50.478]  All right, Roger.
[01:28:50.478 --> 01:28:51.139]  We love you.
[01:28:51.139 --> 01:28:52.260]  Praying for President Trump.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:52.961]  Big news.
[01:28:52.961 --> 01:28:53.942]  Breaking news.
[01:28:53.942 --> 01:28:55.123]  Your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:28:55.123 --> 01:28:56.345]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[01:28:56.345 --> 01:28:57.046]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:58.649 --> 01:29:05.012]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:11.436]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:29:11.436 --> 01:29:14.798]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[01:29:14.798 --> 01:29:23.962]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:29:23.962 --> 01:29:24.423]  Look it up.
[01:29:25.043 --> 01:29:26.403]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:29.624]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[01:29:29.624 --> 01:29:32.765]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.

[01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:37.866]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:29:37.866 --> 01:29:39.306]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:29:39.306 --> 01:29:40.287]  It is amazing.
[01:29:40.287 --> 01:29:41.927]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:29:41.927 --> 01:29:45.148]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:29:45.148 --> 01:29:46.568]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:29:46.568 --> 01:29:50.329]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[01:29:50.569 --> 01:29:53.112]  Get yours today at Infowarshore.com for a limited time.
[01:29:53.112 --> 01:29:54.613]  We're running a 10% discount.
[01:29:54.613 --> 01:29:55.574]  That is a huge discount.
[01:29:55.574 --> 01:29:56.996]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:29:56.996 --> 01:29:58.457]  You need this filter.
[01:29:58.457 --> 01:30:00.680]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.321]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:30:02.321 --> 01:30:03.302]  They have a lot of power.
[01:30:03.302 --> 01:30:04.664]  But they can be defeated.
[01:30:04.664 --> 01:30:07.206]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:30:07.807 --> 01:30:08.167]  I think so.
[01:30:22.824 --> 01:30:29.169]  Put hundreds of gallons through it a day, it purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:29.169 --> 01:30:31.171]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:30:31.171 --> 01:30:33.312]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[01:30:33.312 --> 01:30:36.115]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[01:30:36.115 --> 01:30:41.199]  Exclusively at InfoWarpStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[01:30:41.199 --> 01:30:44.821]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[01:30:44.821 --> 01:30:46.563]  Get it today and it funds the InfoWarp.
[01:30:46.883 --> 01:30:47.725]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:30:47.725 --> 01:30:54.718]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:30:54.718 --> 01:30:57.182]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:06.717]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:08.178]  That is the hellish future.
[01:31:08.178 --> 01:31:17.606]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[01:31:17.606 --> 01:31:23.190]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:25.152]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:31:25.752 --> 01:31:31.134]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[01:31:31.134 --> 01:31:35.075]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:31:35.075 --> 01:31:40.956]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:31:40.956 --> 01:31:43.037]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[01:31:43.797 --> 01:31:44.398]  We're good to go.
[01:31:58.875 --> 01:32:05.498]  In the 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:32:05.498 --> 01:32:08.299]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:32:08.299 --> 01:32:16.663]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:16.663 --> 01:32:19.084]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:32:19.084 --> 01:32:22.086]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:32:22.406 --> 01:32:24.968]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:32:24.968 --> 01:32:33.375]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:32:33.375 --> 01:32:35.236]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:32:35.236 --> 01:32:41.842]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:32:42.302 --> 01:32:47.486]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:32:47.486 --> 01:32:53.630]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[01:32:53.630 --> 01:33:00.314]  Available now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:33:00.314 --> 01:33:06.198]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.922 --> 01:33:15.066]  We are here today to tell you.
[01:33:15.066 --> 01:33:16.668]  You picked this fight.
[01:33:16.668 --> 01:33:18.550]  You wanted this fight.
[01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:20.292]  Well, guess what?
[01:33:20.292 --> 01:33:21.053]  You've got it.
[01:33:22.094 --> 01:33:23.314]  Let's fight!
[01:33:23.314 --> 01:33:30.036]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:33:30.036 --> 01:33:34.057]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:33:34.057 --> 01:33:36.097]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:36.097 --> 01:33:38.318]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:38.318 --> 01:33:40.318]  John has a long mustache.
[01:33:40.318 --> 01:33:41.938]  John has a long mustache.
[01:33:41.938 --> 01:33:45.359]  It's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:33:45.359 --> 01:33:49.280]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:33:53.049 --> 01:33:59.879]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:33:59.879 --> 01:34:02.463]  You better believe you got one!
[01:34:02.463 --> 01:34:09.112]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:11.044 --> 01:34:14.546]  Humanity's not going down without a fight.
[01:34:14.546 --> 01:34:21.890]  At the very front of the battle for humanity and our future is InfoWars and this operation.
[01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:22.970]  You've got my pledge.
[01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:24.431]  You're the best job I can.
[01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:28.273]  But I can't do it without you.
[01:34:28.273 --> 01:34:29.614]  All right, folks.
[01:34:29.614 --> 01:34:35.277]  I want to open the phones up for several hours here and take your phone calls on Trump.
[01:34:36.485 --> 01:34:38.566]  And I love, that's a whole other story.
[01:34:38.566 --> 01:34:48.771]  He comes out a few months ago and he goes, yeah, I've been told we're going to be indicted by Alvin Bragg for this kangaroo garbage with Stormy Daniels in New York.
[01:34:48.771 --> 01:34:50.031]  And the media goes, he's crazy.
[01:34:50.031 --> 01:34:50.652]  He's a liar.
[01:34:50.652 --> 01:34:51.732]  No one's indicting him.
[01:34:51.732 --> 01:34:54.814]  And they indicted him, not the week he said, but the next week.
[01:34:54.814 --> 01:35:02.717]  And then he goes, yeah, I've been told I'll be indicted in the next week to two weeks for the documents that are my documents.
[01:35:02.717 --> 01:35:03.738]  They indicted him the next day.
[01:35:05.003 --> 01:35:10.807]  And so now his lawyers have talked to him and they said, no, the grand jury's indicted and you get ready.
[01:35:10.807 --> 01:35:12.749]  And the corporate media wants to edge this out.
[01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:14.890]  They're like, oh, they're looking at indicting him.
[01:35:14.890 --> 01:35:15.911]  No, it's done.
[01:35:19.153 --> 01:35:20.814]  And it's for January 6th.
[01:35:20.814 --> 01:35:24.357]  And they literally say that Roger Stone and I quarterbacked an attack and worked with Trump.
[01:35:24.357 --> 01:35:25.198]  None of it's true.
[01:35:25.198 --> 01:35:26.799]  I can tell you on my children.
[01:35:26.799 --> 01:35:29.101]  Strike me down with a bolt of lightning if I'm lying.
[01:35:29.101 --> 01:35:30.522]  We walked into a trap.
[01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:32.303]  Everybody already knows that.
[01:35:32.303 --> 01:35:36.687]  But it is, I mean, I feel like I'm in a dream right now.
[01:35:36.687 --> 01:35:42.871]  People ask, like, how are you taking being followed by the feds every day and PI groups and they're all after you and they're harassing all your crew and everything.
[01:35:42.871 --> 01:35:43.312]  And I'm just like,
[01:35:44.824 --> 01:35:46.785]  They're killing unborn babies.
[01:35:46.785 --> 01:35:48.606]  They're trying to cut little kids' penises off.
[01:35:48.606 --> 01:35:50.167]  They're cutting millions of them off.
[01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:52.368]  I mean, we're getting screwed over here.
[01:35:52.368 --> 01:35:55.210]  I mean, at least I am a big, strong man.
[01:35:55.210 --> 01:36:01.734]  I'm not saying I'm the biggest or the strongest, but I can take a lot of pain and I can sure as hell fight.
[01:36:01.734 --> 01:36:06.437]  And I mean, I'm a full-grown 49-year-old man, and man, I'm shook up by this.
[01:36:06.437 --> 01:36:09.158]  I feel really sorry for the women and children.
[01:36:09.158 --> 01:36:10.839]  People ask, how are you handling it, Jones?
[01:36:10.839 --> 01:36:11.180]  I'm a man.
[01:36:12.631 --> 01:36:13.932]  And I'm pretty upset.
[01:36:13.932 --> 01:36:18.095]  So all I can tell you is this is bad news, folks.
[01:36:18.095 --> 01:36:23.979]  And when the general public figures out how much trouble they're in, I mean, we got crazy people running stuff.
[01:36:23.979 --> 01:36:33.165]  I mean, these lunatics came up with a poison shot with an HIV delivery system to fry our immune systems, and they just injected two billion people with it.
[01:36:33.165 --> 01:36:34.546]  People go, well, they're getting exposed.
[01:36:34.546 --> 01:36:39.470]  Yeah, they got something bigger they're about to launch where you're not even going to be thinking about what they just hit you with.
[01:36:45.692 --> 01:36:48.813]  So people say, well, what are you doing scaring us for the enemy?
[01:36:48.813 --> 01:36:52.054]  No, I'm telling you how bad it is.
[01:36:52.054 --> 01:36:57.555]  I mean, you better come to grips, ladies and gentlemen, with the fact that these people don't just want to eat your lunch.
[01:36:57.555 --> 01:37:00.036]  They want to eat you.
[01:37:00.036 --> 01:37:10.699]  And realize that because of normalcy bias, someone that always loses kind of gives up on average and thinks they're a loser.
[01:37:13.635 --> 01:37:15.616]  Winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:37:15.616 --> 01:37:19.278]  To quote Vince Lombardi.
[01:37:19.278 --> 01:37:22.320]  Nothing succeeds like success.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:41.331]  Well the criminals like Fauci and Bill Gates and Bill Gates' father have gotten away with such massive crimes against humanity that they believe they can't be defeated.
[01:37:41.331 --> 01:37:42.772]  And that's really what we're dealing with right now.
[01:37:43.852 --> 01:37:45.734]  So I want to hit all the rest of the news.
[01:37:45.734 --> 01:37:48.878]  I want to open the phones up, but I want to open the phones up and I'm being really nice.
[01:37:48.878 --> 01:37:52.262]  I love the listeners, but I do this like once a month.
[01:37:52.262 --> 01:37:54.205]  We're on one topic, folks, not.
[01:37:55.285 --> 01:38:00.769]  Not the Loch Ness Monster, not Flying Saucers, not Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:38:00.769 --> 01:38:03.632]  We all know he's a cokehead pedophile and the government's covering it up.
[01:38:03.632 --> 01:38:04.913]  We already know all that.
[01:38:04.913 --> 01:38:06.794]  All the other shows cover that ad nauseum.
[01:38:06.794 --> 01:38:09.917]  We're not talking about Hunter Biden, the crackhead Chinese agent.
[01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:10.617]  We already know that.
[01:38:10.617 --> 01:38:14.781]  It's like, we're going to talk how stop signs are red for two hours.
[01:38:14.781 --> 01:38:17.843]  We already know that.
[01:38:17.843 --> 01:38:19.845]  We are talking about
[01:38:22.307 --> 01:38:29.529]  The front-runner presidential candidate, who had the last election stolen, being prepared to be indicted in D.C.
[01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:34.570]  Because let me tell you, indicted in Florida, he'll probably get somewhat of a fair trial.
[01:38:34.570 --> 01:38:36.470]  He's gonna win that.
[01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:38.491]  Indicted by that idiot Bragg?
[01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:40.191]  They got that.
[01:38:40.191 --> 01:38:43.792]  Indicted in D.C.?
[01:38:43.792 --> 01:38:46.233]  He could be as pure as Jesus Christ.
[01:38:46.233 --> 01:38:47.833]  They're gonna nail his ass to a cross.
[01:38:50.256 --> 01:38:53.181]  I'm not saying Trump is as pure as Jesus Christ.
[01:38:53.181 --> 01:38:56.166]  But when it comes to corruption, he basically is.
[01:38:56.166 --> 01:39:00.433]  The guy does not take bribes, orders from no one.
[01:39:00.433 --> 01:39:01.655]  He gives the orders.
[01:39:01.655 --> 01:39:02.596]  And that's why they don't like him.
[01:39:05.359 --> 01:39:07.642]  This is where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:07.642 --> 01:39:12.086]  These people are crazy enough with the most popular president in modern history.
[01:39:12.086 --> 01:39:13.068]  You heard Roger Stone.
[01:39:13.068 --> 01:39:14.109]  He doesn't speculate.
[01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:18.413]  He said he's never seen anybody since polling began as popular as Trump.
[01:39:18.413 --> 01:39:23.219]  I mean, they took him from being popular to ultra popular with this move.
[01:39:25.365 --> 01:39:29.989]  And anybody can look at that and say, that's not going to go well for the people that did that.
[01:39:29.989 --> 01:39:30.950]  They don't care.
[01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:37.416]  Though you see Jax with his press conferences, his knees are knocking, he's stuttering, he looks like he's about to frickin' die.
[01:39:39.144 --> 01:39:44.246]  Yeah, dude, you just took on the President of the United States who's super popular and is a good person.
[01:39:44.246 --> 01:39:46.287]  I mean, you're crazy.
[01:39:46.287 --> 01:39:50.149]  Four Chinese communist pedophile crackhead puppets?
[01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:53.311]  I mean, like, you know, it's not like you took down some good dude for something better.
[01:39:53.311 --> 01:40:01.975]  I'd be like, well, I don't like that, doing that, but I kind of see what you're... No, no, you're literally trying to shoot down somebody good for absolute total crap.
[01:40:03.834 --> 01:40:10.798]  That wants to cut off our energy and cut our kids' penises off and butcher the border and smuggle kids.
[01:40:10.798 --> 01:40:13.759]  I mean, you guys are villains, villains.
[01:40:13.759 --> 01:40:16.121]  I got a hand in the Democrats and their handlers.
[01:40:16.121 --> 01:40:17.962]  You guys are really bad.
[01:40:17.962 --> 01:40:24.285]  I mean, if you're trying to be bad, let me tell you, like MS-13 tries to be as... MS-13 has come out in their own documents.
[01:40:24.285 --> 01:40:27.067]  It's like, how do we get worse?
[01:40:27.067 --> 01:40:30.048]  Let's grab an eight-year-old girl, rape her and cut her heart out for Satan.
[01:40:30.048 --> 01:40:30.829]  Let's go do that, yeah.
[01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:38.526]  You're like, well, they've been on methamphetamine for five years and they're whacked out of their minds.
[01:40:38.526 --> 01:40:39.567]  It's like, that's crazy.
[01:40:39.567 --> 01:40:46.390]  You're like, why would you kidnap a girl out of her backyard and rape her and then cut her heart out and deliver it to her mom?
[01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:48.250]  Well, it's a nasty, horrible thing to do.
[01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:48.771]  Why not?
[01:40:48.771 --> 01:40:53.873]  You're like, you know, a normal person's like, that doesn't sound too nice.
[01:40:53.873 --> 01:40:55.554]  That doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do.
[01:40:59.073 --> 01:41:06.722]  But see, you're not MS-13, you're not Merrick Garland, you're not Barack Obama, who has a heart on for this country.
[01:41:07.984 --> 01:41:13.547]  Who feels slighted when he's on a 300-foot luxury yacht eating caviar.
[01:41:13.547 --> 01:41:14.848]  Oh, America sucks.
[01:41:14.848 --> 01:41:16.049]  I gotta beat it.
[01:41:16.049 --> 01:41:18.510]  While you own stock in slave mines in Africa.
[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:22.992]  It's all just an excuse to rape and kill and have power over something.
[01:41:22.992 --> 01:41:27.255]  Because America had a potential to defeat evil and Satan knew that.
[01:41:27.255 --> 01:41:32.558]  So the main mission to all of Satan's minions is destroy America now!
[01:41:32.558 --> 01:41:32.978]  Now!
[01:41:32.978 --> 01:41:33.298]  Go!
[01:41:33.298 --> 01:41:33.598]  Go!
[01:41:33.598 --> 01:41:33.859]  Go!
[01:41:33.859 --> 01:41:34.119]  Go!
[01:41:34.119 --> 01:41:34.639]  Go!
[01:41:34.639 --> 01:41:36.100]  I'll give you power, just destroy it!
[01:41:38.604 --> 01:41:39.684]  So here's the toll-free number.
[01:41:39.684 --> 01:41:40.125]  We'll go to break.
[01:41:40.125 --> 01:41:41.225]  Come back with your phone calls.
[01:41:41.225 --> 01:41:44.647]  On Trump and the looming D.C.
[01:41:44.647 --> 01:41:49.849]  January 6th indictment, which means the American people and all his supporters framed for terror.
[01:41:49.849 --> 01:41:51.630]  And all of us persecuted more.
[01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:53.250]  It's just the detonator.
[01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:55.891]  Just the cap on the back of the cartridge.
[01:41:55.891 --> 01:41:59.473]  If you think the January 6th persecution was bad so far, that's just the beginning.
[01:42:01.118 --> 01:42:06.201]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, on this one subject, to focus on this one big subject today, on this Tuesday, July 18th, worldwide transmission.
[01:42:23.325 --> 01:42:24.606]  Well, we're getting the calls lined up.
[01:42:24.606 --> 01:42:26.648]  I'm going to come back and take Fauci to the woodshed.
[01:42:26.648 --> 01:42:30.291]  Then we'll take the Pitots to the woodshed with a lot of breaking news.
[01:42:30.291 --> 01:42:30.732]  So much.
[01:42:30.732 --> 01:42:32.353]  We'll be interspersing with your calls.
[01:42:32.353 --> 01:42:34.695]  What'll happen is I'll hit a story, take three or four calls.
[01:42:34.695 --> 01:42:36.897]  Hit a story, take three or four more calls.
[01:42:36.897 --> 01:42:38.119]  And who knows?
[01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:43.223]  We got another great guest host the fourth hour, but you know, I've been a little bit of a Miss Piggy these days.
[01:42:43.223 --> 01:42:44.064]  Maria Z's awesome.
[01:42:44.064 --> 01:42:45.485]  I'm going to take 15 minutes to the fourth hour.
[01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:50.269]  Just to make sure we get to all your calls and cover all the news.
[01:42:50.269 --> 01:42:55.013]  So that means we've got like an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and 30 minutes straight ahead.
[01:42:55.013 --> 01:42:56.194]  Your phone calls and news.
[01:42:56.194 --> 01:42:57.234]  InfoWars.com.
[01:42:57.234 --> 01:42:57.735]  Spread that link.
[01:42:58.826 --> 01:43:03.009]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:43:03.009 --> 01:43:08.252]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:08.252 --> 01:43:20.600]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.762]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:43:24.582 --> 01:43:37.609]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:39.910]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:43.972]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve
[01:43:45.033 --> 01:44:05.248]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:44:05.248 --> 01:44:07.170]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:08.671]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:44:08.671 --> 01:44:11.473]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:44:11.473 --> 01:44:13.494]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:44:14.275 --> 01:44:16.237]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:44:16.237 --> 01:44:18.659]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:44:18.659 --> 01:44:20.801]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:44:20.801 --> 01:44:26.186]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:44:26.186 --> 01:44:27.408]  Jail background.
[01:44:27.408 --> 01:44:28.448]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:44:28.448 --> 01:44:32.592]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:44:32.592 --> 01:44:34.194]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:44:34.194 --> 01:44:35.215]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:44:35.215 --> 01:44:37.757]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:44:37.757 --> 01:44:38.538]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:39.419]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:44:40.099 --> 01:44:42.961]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:44:42.961 --> 01:44:44.823]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:44:44.823 --> 01:44:54.210]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free AAA-253-3139.

[01:45:11.512 --> 01:45:13.734]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:57.781]  Please take action.
[01:45:58.121 --> 01:46:03.144]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:46:03.144 --> 01:46:05.705]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:46:05.705 --> 01:46:07.186]  So let me get this straight.
[01:46:07.186 --> 01:46:26.637]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[01:46:26.937 --> 01:46:53.232]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:46:53.232 --> 01:46:54.453]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:47:00.703 --> 01:47:06.644]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:14.685 --> 01:47:18.830]  We are now in the final segment of hour number two on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:27.500]  I'm set to go right back to your phone calls here in just a moment with more news and information following in the next two hours that follow after this hour.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:30.764]  Let me just say this very simply, very succinctly, very historically.
[01:47:33.735 --> 01:47:38.399]  The corruption we see unfolding is the way it's unfolded throughout human history over and over again.
[01:47:38.399 --> 01:47:39.780]  We're in a cycle.
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:57.075]  So as bad as it seems, as invincibly ignorant as the public looks, and as invincibly arrogant and humorous filled as the establishment is, we have to understand that their time is short and this always ends.
[01:47:57.075 --> 01:48:00.899]  The question is this time with nuclear and biological weapons and they destroy us in the process.
[01:48:02.011 --> 01:48:11.237]  So you have Fauci that, body language-wise, puts off the most insane arrogance I've ever seen.
[01:48:11.237 --> 01:48:20.143]  When I watch footage of him bringing out the AIDS virus and the poison treatments in the 80s, and you watch those footage of him, he was super arrogant back then.
[01:48:20.143 --> 01:48:26.587]  But now, this guy's been running all the major federal agencies that respond to diseases for 45 years.
[01:48:26.587 --> 01:48:26.847]  That's 40
[01:48:30.066 --> 01:48:31.687]  Five years.
[01:48:31.687 --> 01:48:38.409]  And he is just beyond entitled, and his brain cells are trained, I win, you lose.
[01:48:38.409 --> 01:48:46.712]  I can lie to Congress, I can gain a function, I can make hundreds of millions of dollars myself and tell Congress I don't make any money, like Hotez does.
[01:48:46.712 --> 01:48:51.854]  I can get away with murder, which he has so far.
[01:48:51.854 --> 01:48:55.755]  But we know this guy's made hundreds of millions off his poison shots.
[01:48:55.755 --> 01:48:58.256]  Just his piece of it.
[01:48:58.256 --> 01:48:58.536]  And then,
[01:48:59.898 --> 01:49:05.321]  They can't get him for the gain of function, all these crimes they've committed, because the Justice Department won't indict him.
[01:49:05.321 --> 01:49:20.650]  But it's weird how, in the federal bureaucracy, if the law says once you're retired, even if you're a high-level general or whoever you are, unless you're a president or vice president, you don't get Secret Service or federal protection.
[01:49:22.731 --> 01:49:32.936]  So just like they couldn't get Al Capone for all the murders and all the money laundering and all the torture, they got him on income tax evasion.
[01:49:32.936 --> 01:49:34.336]  And so it's the same thing.
[01:49:34.336 --> 01:49:39.879]  It turns out Fauci, since he left a year ago, has an entire federal marshal detail.
[01:49:39.879 --> 01:49:44.461]  Then the federal marshals got asked in interrogatories by Congress, they said, no, we're not funding it.
[01:49:46.144 --> 01:49:50.786]  Now they've been caught lying, and they said, well, someone reimburses us.
[01:49:50.786 --> 01:50:02.832]  So we have a federal agency lying to Congress, saying we don't get money, we don't fund this, and they're lying.
[01:50:02.832 --> 01:50:13.918]  I mean, crime upon crime upon crime, because Fauci's the little darling, and let me tell you, I'm sure Fauci, after all the people he killed, is not a very popular person.
[01:50:15.555 --> 01:50:28.442]  But it's the new elite, where now all these people get federal protection illegally, just like there's congressional hearings that tens of trillions is missing at the Pentagon in the last 25 years.
[01:50:28.442 --> 01:50:31.803]  It was 2 trillion on 9-11, 2001.
[01:50:31.803 --> 01:50:34.365]  They had a conference a few days before.
[01:50:34.365 --> 01:50:35.646]  Oh, 2 trillion missing.
[01:50:35.646 --> 01:50:40.868]  Now it's tens of trillions missing, and they have hearings where they failed all the audits they've done.
[01:50:40.868 --> 01:50:41.989]  It's the same culture.
[01:50:43.857 --> 01:50:49.620]  The same entitled bureaucratic culture of criminals robbing and stealing everything.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:58.484]  And so Fauci may not ever get in trouble for his mass murder and releasing COVID-19 or the poison shots or lying about the efficacy of the shots.
[01:50:58.484 --> 01:51:11.111]  But he may go down for having the security detail and the security detail, the federal marshals lying to Congress and saying, we don't pay for his detail.
[01:51:12.435 --> 01:51:14.657]  And now going, well actually we do.
[01:51:14.657 --> 01:51:18.099]  We're told it's reimbursed by somebody.
[01:51:18.099 --> 01:51:19.800]  It doesn't matter if you're reimbursed.
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.021]  You just lied to Congress.
[01:51:21.021 --> 01:51:25.123]  So see, this is just, this is how the corruption works.
[01:51:25.123 --> 01:51:29.406]  And pretty soon, if you're a corrupt federal marshal, why should your guys even show up on work on time?
[01:51:29.406 --> 01:51:31.848]  Because they're already, see, it breaks everything down.
[01:51:34.895 --> 01:51:45.360]  It's like if you work in a company and somebody in the company refuses to come to work, other people start refusing to come to work, and you say, well, no, Bill doesn't come to work.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:58.386]  It's the unfairness of this system across the board that the public can get, like, wait a minute, you're retired and you've got a whole federal marshal detail, like 10 dudes, five people at a time, 24 hours a day?
[01:51:58.386 --> 01:52:01.968]  Why don't you spend your own stolen money, you little murderer?
[01:52:01.968 --> 01:52:03.369]  Why don't you get your own security?
[01:52:07.352 --> 01:52:08.394]  But Fauci's a Democrat.
[01:52:08.394 --> 01:52:09.856]  He doesn't support the Second Amendment.
[01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:17.546]  He wants to take your gun in your crime-infested city where George Soros got rid of the cops or cut them back.
[01:52:17.546 --> 01:52:24.356]  He doesn't want you to have a gun, but he's got ten federal marshals, ten, that protect him seven days a week.
[01:52:25.683 --> 01:52:28.445]  He goes to the grocery store, the movie theater, out to eat.
[01:52:28.445 --> 01:52:30.186]  Five men with guns go with him.
[01:52:30.186 --> 01:52:32.108]  They drive him around in government SUVs.
[01:52:32.108 --> 01:52:34.229]  They kiss his murdering ass.
[01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:40.814]  And then when it comes out it's illegal, they lie to Congress and say, no, we aren't doing the security.
[01:52:40.814 --> 01:52:44.237]  Well, there's video of you doing security from your own marshals.
[01:52:44.237 --> 01:52:47.999]  Well, uh, we... Okay.
[01:52:47.999 --> 01:52:51.582]  It's not being paid for by us.
[01:52:51.582 --> 01:52:52.643]  Oh, now you're rent-a-cops.
[01:52:55.071 --> 01:53:04.260]  Lies, lies, lies, on top of lies, on top of lies, on top of lies, on top of lies, on top of lies.
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:10.265]  That sound like a free, open society you want to live in?
[01:53:10.265 --> 01:53:12.067]  And I don't think those federal marshals are our enemy.
[01:53:12.067 --> 01:53:15.490]  I'm just asking them, well obviously they're the ones that blew the whistle.
[01:53:15.490 --> 01:53:16.311]  Is this good?
[01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:18.653]  No, it's not good for that little monster.
[01:53:23.103 --> 01:53:26.204]  Play the clip of Rand Paul going after him.
[01:53:26.204 --> 01:53:28.025]  Let's move to Dr. Fauci.
[01:53:28.025 --> 01:53:34.287]  So now we've proven that Dr. Fauci is getting around-the-clock security provided by the U.S.
[01:53:34.287 --> 01:53:35.148]  Marshals.
[01:53:35.148 --> 01:53:42.231]  That means they station someone outside his house, the limousines take him wherever he needs to go to the airport.
[01:53:42.231 --> 01:53:45.572]  Why, if he's not in government anymore, would he get this?
[01:53:47.799 --> 01:53:49.421]  So we've been hearing these rumors.
[01:53:49.421 --> 01:53:50.862]  He announced his retirement.
[01:53:50.862 --> 01:53:51.683]  By the way, hit pause.
[01:53:51.683 --> 01:53:53.165]  Hit pause and back it up.
[01:53:53.165 --> 01:53:59.972]  Rand Paul's had his ribs broken, his lung punctured, attacked in public, shot at, trying to kill him.
[01:53:59.972 --> 01:54:01.954]  They shot Scalise.
[01:54:01.954 --> 01:54:03.796]  There's like five attacks on Rand Paul.
[01:54:03.796 --> 01:54:06.479]  He gets no security.
[01:54:06.479 --> 01:54:07.661]  Fine.
[01:54:07.661 --> 01:54:08.722]  I don't think we're in the business of that.
[01:54:08.722 --> 01:54:09.603]  He should be able to carry a gun.
[01:54:11.872 --> 01:54:15.353]  But Fauci gets 10 agents a day.
[01:54:15.353 --> 01:54:16.293]  I looked at the documents.
[01:54:16.293 --> 01:54:17.873]  Five a day.
[01:54:17.873 --> 01:54:18.973]  Five a shift.
[01:54:18.973 --> 01:54:20.274]  There's like two shifts.
[01:54:20.274 --> 01:54:22.654]  They're long shifts, I guess.
[01:54:22.654 --> 01:54:24.054]  So they're doing like 12 hours apiece.
[01:54:24.054 --> 01:54:28.615]  They work like four days a week.
[01:54:28.615 --> 01:54:32.176]  He's got two shifts of all these armed people.
[01:54:32.176 --> 01:54:37.557]  And then again, back to Rand Paul.
[01:54:37.557 --> 01:54:37.917]  Fauci.
[01:54:38.399 --> 01:54:44.662]  So now we've proven that Dr. Fauci is getting around-the-clock security provided by the U.S.
[01:54:44.662 --> 01:54:45.523]  Marshals.
[01:54:45.523 --> 01:54:52.606]  That means they stationed someone outside his house, the limousines take him wherever he needs to go to the airport.
[01:54:52.606 --> 01:54:55.948]  Why, if he's not in government anymore, would he get this?
[01:54:58.154 --> 01:54:59.795]  So we've been hearing these rumors.
[01:54:59.795 --> 01:55:07.201]  He announced his retirement, and then somebody said, oh, well, he still comes into the office periodically, and he still has his security detail, and we're like, how come?
[01:55:07.201 --> 01:55:09.162]  He's no longer working.
[01:55:09.162 --> 01:55:18.028]  So we asked HHS early in the summer, we said, is he still working, and does he have his limo, and does he have a driver, and does he have a security detail?
[01:55:18.028 --> 01:55:22.652]  Well, HHS actually came back to us and said they haven't been paying for it since January.
[01:55:23.132 --> 01:55:32.298]  But then we discovered that Fox did a Freedom of Information Act and a judge forced them to say that, well, while HHS wasn't directly funding it, the U.S.
[01:55:32.298 --> 01:55:33.759]  Marshals were funding it.
[01:55:33.759 --> 01:55:34.940]  So can you imagine?
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:39.042]  We asked the government, are you funding his limo and his driver and his security detail?
[01:55:39.042 --> 01:55:41.124]  And they say, oh, we're not doing it.
[01:55:41.124 --> 01:55:43.005]  Oh, but somebody else is doing it.
[01:55:43.005 --> 01:55:44.846]  And then we're reimbursing them.
[01:55:44.846 --> 01:55:45.947]  So it's a terrible,
[01:55:46.527 --> 01:55:46.967]  I'm not.
[01:56:03.579 --> 01:56:06.300]  We want to know, does he still get legal representation?
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:08.400]  Because I think he may need that eventually.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.460]  But he's a rich man.
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:12.881]  His wealth increased by 30% during the pandemic.
[01:56:12.881 --> 01:56:17.442]  I think he ought to pay for his own security detail and his own legal defense if he needs one.
[01:56:17.442 --> 01:56:18.042]  I do too.
[01:56:18.042 --> 01:56:21.703]  Senator Rand Paul, thanks so much for joining PRIMETIME.
[01:56:21.703 --> 01:56:23.803]  The truth is he murdered millions of Americans.
[01:56:23.803 --> 01:56:26.844]  He quarterbacked the global attack.
[01:56:26.844 --> 01:56:28.924]  He's a very important person because he's Joseph Mengele.
[01:56:30.472 --> 01:56:35.836]  And you better believe Joseph Mengele, their mad scientist doctor in Nazi Germany, was protected.
[01:56:35.836 --> 01:56:37.778]  So was Fauci.
[01:56:37.778 --> 01:56:38.559]  But I want to be clear.
[01:56:38.559 --> 01:56:42.522]  I don't want anybody to kill him.
[01:56:42.522 --> 01:56:43.803]  Or hurt him.
[01:56:43.803 --> 01:56:45.865]  I want to destroy him.
[01:56:45.865 --> 01:56:47.586]  I want him indicted.
[01:56:47.586 --> 01:56:53.531]  And one day, on national television, after he's convicted and had his appeal, I want to see him hung.
[01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:56.452]  I don't say that vindictively.
[01:56:56.452 --> 01:56:57.293]  He's a mass murderer.
[01:56:57.293 --> 01:56:58.234]  He's an arrogant monster.
[01:56:58.234 --> 01:57:11.492]  We need to send a message to other medical serial killers, like Joseph Mengele and Anthony Fauci, that killed Mickey Willis' brother, that you're gonna pay.
[01:57:12.682 --> 01:57:17.623]  And I don't get up here to act bravado, like I'm ready to have people killed or whatever, to act tough.
[01:57:17.623 --> 01:57:19.564]  No, they don't like it when we say this.
[01:57:19.564 --> 01:57:21.764]  I want them to know, you want to kill me?
[01:57:21.764 --> 01:57:24.405]  I legally and lawfully in the system want to kill you too.
[01:57:24.405 --> 01:57:25.705]  You want to kill me, Fauci?
[01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.345]  I want you to die too, buddy.
[01:57:27.345 --> 01:57:28.086]  But through the system.
[01:57:28.086 --> 01:57:29.326]  We'll do it right.
[01:57:29.326 --> 01:57:34.327]  And if nobody will pull the switch after you're convicted, I will pull the switch to hang your ass.
[01:57:34.327 --> 01:57:38.528]  I will walk up there and pull that lever and break your neck in a second, you mass murdering monster.
[01:57:39.807 --> 01:57:42.089]  So fill your hand, you son of a bitch.
[01:57:42.089 --> 01:57:42.809]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:42.809 --> 01:57:43.449]  Hour number three.
[01:57:43.449 --> 01:57:44.530]  Stay with us.
[01:57:44.530 --> 01:57:48.373]  Justice is coming.
[01:57:48.373 --> 01:58:03.303]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:05.424]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:58:05.424 --> 01:58:08.406]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:58:08.406 --> 01:58:10.028]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:58:10.028 --> 01:58:14.971]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:58:14.971 --> 01:58:21.275]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:58:21.275 --> 01:58:26.979]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:58:26.979 --> 01:58:33.144]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water
[01:58:34.884 --> 01:58:37.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:58:37.565 --> 01:58:38.865]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:58:38.865 --> 01:58:41.726]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:58:41.726 --> 01:58:49.548]  Go to nfowarrestore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:58:49.548 --> 01:58:59.630]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at nfowarrestore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[01:58:59.630 --> 01:59:01.211]  We have the turmeric toothpaste,
[01:59:02.148 --> 01:59:14.757]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Pearl Calcium Toothpaste, and we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[01:59:14.757 --> 01:59:16.838]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[01:59:16.838 --> 01:59:18.179]  They're very, very strong.
[01:59:18.179 --> 01:59:20.281]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[01:59:20.281 --> 01:59:21.322]  Ours don't.
[01:59:21.322 --> 01:59:22.763]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[01:59:22.763 --> 01:59:24.364]  It is just chock-full.
[01:59:25.044 --> 01:59:26.186]  We're good to go.
[01:59:51.954 --> 02:00:06.218]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.218 --> 02:00:12.079]  First of all, we have an accusatory commentary of Soros DAs.
[02:00:12.079 --> 02:00:19.041]  Let us not put an individual that is not here, a contributing American and jeopardizes life, but always
[02:00:19.721 --> 02:00:24.102]  Throwing his name out in the most ugliest way, I am offended by that.
[02:00:24.102 --> 02:00:27.904]  Ladies and gentlemen, the system isn't gonna save you and it ain't gonna be there when this goes down.
[02:00:27.904 --> 02:00:30.585]  Mr. Soros does not deserve that.
[02:00:30.585 --> 02:00:32.885]  He is an American and a patriot.
[02:00:32.885 --> 02:00:41.148]  But, if we work hard, the globalists won't come out on top of this collapse as the bosses to bring in a tyranny a thousand times worse.
[02:00:41.752 --> 02:01:00.852]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest in the very poorest places and so it's really an acute problem in a certain number of places and we've got to make sure that we help out with the tools now so that they don't have an impossible situation later.
[02:01:04.039 --> 02:01:15.826]  This idea, creative capitalism, an approach where governments, businesses, and non-profits work together to stretch the reach of market forces.
[02:01:15.826 --> 02:01:32.917]  So, we better be fighting as hard as we can, and fighting five times harder than these devils, to be affecting the battle space psychologically with the truth, exposing that they did it, they're the ones behind it, here's what they're going to try once the collapse accelerates, so people don't comply with them during the collapse.
[02:01:33.337 --> 02:01:36.340]  It is about having a world government.
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:38.081]  A new world order.
[02:01:38.081 --> 02:01:41.004]  They are the ones who will govern the world.
[02:01:41.004 --> 02:01:50.072]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[02:01:50.072 --> 02:01:58.420]  There was to be a government by these elites who will impose their rules on everyone in this world.
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:07.164]  And for those who are unwilling to submit to them, there will be punishment.
[02:02:07.164 --> 02:02:10.985]  Now the population of the world is 7 billion.
[02:02:10.985 --> 02:02:12.066]  There will be a need
[02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:23.294]  To kill many billions of people, or to stop them to death, or to prevent them from giving birth, in order to reduce the population of this world.
[02:02:23.294 --> 02:02:38.627]  Because they're going to release a new virus, and, you know, be locking people up, and promising to bring back the good times, if you just take your shot, or oh, if your neighbor went away, but Bob was causing a problem and not going along with it, you know, they're the non-compliers, you'll get your electricity back.
[02:02:38.627 --> 02:02:40.829]  So we, you know, we'll have to
[02:02:42.171 --> 02:02:53.124]  You're being put in the process of being once free, now being a slave.
[02:02:53.124 --> 02:03:00.093]  Like the Bank of England already prepared their microchip implant RFID chip to be implanted under your skin.
[02:03:01.212 --> 02:03:02.913]  They think you're weak!
[02:03:28.618 --> 02:03:30.279]  They think you're stupid?
[02:03:30.279 --> 02:03:39.182]  What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[02:03:39.182 --> 02:03:43.864]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[02:03:43.864 --> 02:03:51.586]  We're now seeing mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[02:03:51.586 --> 02:03:55.288]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[02:03:55.968 --> 02:04:00.092]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[02:04:00.092 --> 02:04:02.594]  Now it's going under the skin.
[02:04:02.594 --> 02:04:06.317]  I don't hate the military, I don't hate the Border Patrol, but they're just like average Americans.
[02:04:06.317 --> 02:04:08.459]  They follow criminal orders.
[02:04:08.459 --> 02:04:09.820]  Is there a crisis at our southern border?
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.623]  Senator, there is a very significant... That's a yes or no question.
[02:04:15.623 --> 02:04:17.124]  Is there a crisis?
[02:04:17.124 --> 02:04:29.992]  Mr. Secretary, I want to say to you right now, your behavior is disgraceful and the deaths, the children assaulted, the children raped, they are at your feet and if you had integrity you would resign.
[02:04:29.992 --> 02:04:33.474]  Just keep pretending everybody that we aren't overrun.
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:38.522]  You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.
[02:04:38.522 --> 02:04:40.783]  But it ain't about how hard you hit.
[02:04:40.783 --> 02:04:44.384]  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
[02:04:44.384 --> 02:04:47.866]  How much you can take and keep moving forward.
[02:04:47.866 --> 02:04:49.406]  That's how winning is done!
[02:04:49.406 --> 02:04:51.947]  Nobody's coming to save you but yourself.
[02:04:51.947 --> 02:04:53.428]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[02:04:53.428 --> 02:04:54.868]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[02:04:54.868 --> 02:04:55.809]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[02:04:59.349 --> 02:05:05.714]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:05:05.714 --> 02:05:12.160]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.503]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[02:05:15.503 --> 02:05:24.690]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:25.131]  Look it up.
[02:05:25.751 --> 02:05:27.112]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:05:27.112 --> 02:05:30.333]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:05:30.333 --> 02:05:33.474]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:05:33.474 --> 02:05:35.795]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[02:05:35.795 --> 02:05:38.596]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[02:05:38.596 --> 02:05:40.016]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:05:40.016 --> 02:05:41.016]  It is amazing.
[02:05:41.016 --> 02:05:42.657]  It's great for your home, your business.
[02:05:42.657 --> 02:05:45.858]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[02:05:45.858 --> 02:05:47.279]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[02:05:47.279 --> 02:05:51.040]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.721]  Get yours today at importworkstore.com for a limited time.
[02:05:53.721 --> 02:05:55.322]  We're running a 10% discount.
[02:05:55.322 --> 02:05:56.422]  That is a huge discount.
[02:05:56.422 --> 02:05:57.703]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:05:57.703 --> 02:06:15.571]  You need this filter.
[02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:19.393]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.063 --> 02:06:25.486]  Alright, we are now into our number three.
[02:06:25.486 --> 02:06:28.028]  Loaded phone lines, about to go to your calls.
[02:06:28.028 --> 02:06:30.329]  Let me get one more big story.
[02:06:30.329 --> 02:06:35.013]  A group of stories before I go to your phone calls.
[02:06:35.013 --> 02:06:38.435]  A prominent podcaster sent me this next video I want to play.
[02:06:38.435 --> 02:06:42.658]  And this is Disney television with a dinosaur show.
[02:06:42.658 --> 02:06:47.482]  Where it shows two boy dinosaurs being gay, wanting to have their own egg.
[02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:51.711]  And again, this is just everywhere.
[02:06:51.711 --> 02:06:53.331]  What is the sexualization?
[02:06:53.331 --> 02:06:54.252]  Why is this happening?
[02:06:54.252 --> 02:06:58.553]  Because they want to confuse things and depopulate the earth.
[02:06:58.553 --> 02:07:17.200]  And then we get Charles Barkley, hopefully we bleep this, out of the bar two nights ago saying, F you redneck racist, F you people, we need trans, we need... What does it have to do with rednecks not wanting kids targeted to be sterilized?
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:21.861]  But that's just Charles Barkley getting his contract redone.
[02:07:21.861 --> 02:07:26.062]  That's just Charles Barkley getting his ESG done.
[02:07:26.062 --> 02:07:28.563]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:07:28.563 --> 02:07:30.863]  Up there saying, I'm going to buy you all Bud Light.
[02:07:30.863 --> 02:07:33.464]  Man, they lost $35 billion.
[02:07:33.464 --> 02:07:36.085]  They're now gone from number one to number 20.
[02:07:36.085 --> 02:07:42.567]  And I love watching Charles Barkley, who I've never even been against, but man, I'm done with him forever.
[02:07:42.567 --> 02:07:47.388]  We're not against Bud Light because we're white people and we're bad because we're white, you racist.
[02:07:49.505 --> 02:07:53.287]  We are against it because it's sexualizing children.
[02:07:53.287 --> 02:07:54.948]  And particularly targeting black children.
[02:07:54.948 --> 02:07:59.631]  If you look at Black Lives Matter, that's their main mission.
[02:07:59.631 --> 02:08:09.556]  But the first thing is this program on Disney television.
[02:08:09.556 --> 02:08:13.878]  Nickelodeon Plus, owned by Disney.
[02:08:13.878 --> 02:08:14.859]  Disney Plus, here it is.
[02:08:18.004 --> 02:08:20.405]  T-Rexes have a nest, too.
[02:08:20.405 --> 02:08:22.025]  But those aren't eggs.
[02:08:22.025 --> 02:08:24.566]  They're rocks!
[02:08:24.566 --> 02:08:28.087]  So that's why they want to be around other dinosaur nests.
[02:08:28.087 --> 02:08:30.227]  These Dino Daddies want eggs of their own.
[02:08:30.227 --> 02:08:32.788]  They want a family.
[02:08:32.788 --> 02:08:37.049]  Aw, they'd be great dads.
[02:08:37.049 --> 02:08:39.970]  There must be something we can do to help them.
[02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:40.510]  There is.
[02:08:42.213 --> 02:08:45.814]  There are lots of eggs that need loving parents to raise them.
[02:08:45.814 --> 02:08:49.334]  And we happen to have a rucksack back in the hatchery that needs a home.
[02:08:49.334 --> 02:08:50.915]  That's right, and two daddies.
[02:08:50.915 --> 02:08:54.455]  So that's Dino Ranch on Disney Plus.
[02:08:54.455 --> 02:08:59.616]  Literally pushing that the two males love each other and they want to have a baby.
[02:08:59.616 --> 02:09:08.878]  So don't worry, they'll find a Christian family to take the baby from and they'll raise it themselves or they'll get some lab-made humanoid with their own DNA spliced together as England's already done.
[02:09:11.522 --> 02:09:14.503]  So now, let's look at the next group of stories here.
[02:09:14.503 --> 02:09:19.264]  YouTube replaces American flag emoji with gay and trans pride flag.
[02:09:19.264 --> 02:09:24.745]  So now you try to find the American flag, all you get is the pedo flag.
[02:09:24.745 --> 02:09:28.666]  YouTube is truly the enemy of the American people.
[02:09:28.666 --> 02:09:31.207]  Because they remove the language, how do you even communicate?
[02:09:31.207 --> 02:09:31.907]  Hilarious!
[02:09:31.907 --> 02:09:36.528]  Obama's brother tweets he's definitely gay after former president defends school porn books.
[02:09:37.247 --> 02:09:38.708]  Well, Barack Obama is gay.
[02:09:38.708 --> 02:09:39.929]  I don't hate him for that.
[02:09:39.929 --> 02:09:45.352]  He's pushing genderqueer that tells children how to have sex with adults and is pro-pedophile.
[02:09:45.352 --> 02:09:46.593]  So I wouldn't say he's definitely gay.
[02:09:46.593 --> 02:09:49.755]  I'd say he's definitely pro-pedo.
[02:09:49.755 --> 02:09:55.559]  Obama slammed for endorsing books banning in school libraries containing graphic sexual content.
[02:09:55.559 --> 02:09:57.440]  Some of the books that shape my life.
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.182]  He then lists books that promote pedophilia.
[02:10:00.182 --> 02:10:03.704]  So he's definitely out of the closet himself pro-pedo.
[02:10:03.704 --> 02:10:06.126]  Just like his best buddy, Tom Hanks.
[02:10:07.285 --> 02:10:14.029]  So, again, think about how wild this has gotten.
[02:10:14.029 --> 02:10:20.352]  Where these books that he promotes, we can't even show you on air, they are so vile.
[02:10:20.352 --> 02:10:25.835]  Birthstrikers, meet the women who refuse to have children until climate change ends.
[02:10:25.835 --> 02:10:30.898]  Meet the women that don't want you to have children, who want to depopulate you.
[02:10:30.898 --> 02:10:34.060]  That's who you're really meeting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:34.861 --> 02:10:40.605]  That's all this agenda is, is depopulation.
[02:10:40.605 --> 02:10:42.206]  Here's a clip I want to play.
[02:10:42.206 --> 02:10:43.847]  Admiral!
[02:10:43.847 --> 02:10:45.128]  Admiral!
[02:10:45.128 --> 02:10:53.814]  Rachel Levine says prepubescent minors should have access to sex change surgeries because they might be going through the wrong puberty.
[02:10:53.814 --> 02:11:02.840]  And Dr. Levine, a man who's really gross looking, who wears a woman's outfit with an admiral outfit and says he's an admiral,
[02:11:04.622 --> 02:11:07.423]  Wants to cut your children's genitals off.
[02:11:07.423 --> 02:11:08.503]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:11:08.503 --> 02:11:09.603]  Here it is.
[02:11:09.603 --> 02:11:15.465]  What would you say to folks who think that they're being reasonable by saying, why can't children just wait till they're 18?
[02:11:15.465 --> 02:11:18.126]  Adolescence is hard and puberty is hard.
[02:11:18.126 --> 02:11:20.707]  What if you're going through the wrong puberty?
[02:11:20.707 --> 02:11:27.069]  What if you inside feel that you are female, but now you're going through a male puberty?
[02:11:27.069 --> 02:11:29.329]  That's right.
[02:11:29.329 --> 02:11:31.430]  Some creepy dude in an admiral outfit
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.161]  Says your child's going through the wrong puberty.
[02:11:35.161 --> 02:11:35.882]  I love the memes.
[02:11:35.882 --> 02:11:38.443]  One of them's hanging on the door out there.
[02:11:38.443 --> 02:11:42.325]  And it shows a woman, nine months pregnant, the doctor's got a stethoscope that goes in her stomach.
[02:11:42.325 --> 02:11:43.786]  And she goes, what's the sex, doctor?
[02:11:43.786 --> 02:11:50.750]  He says, oh, we're going to wait and let the kindergarten teacher decide that.
[02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:53.211]  And you joke about it, but this is their plan.
[02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:55.773]  Oh, look, look at this.
[02:11:55.773 --> 02:11:56.873]  Shocker!
[02:11:56.873 --> 02:12:01.016]  Trans swimmer Leah Thomas comes out as Antiva's super soldier.
[02:12:01.977 --> 02:12:07.159]  So a 6 foot 4 dude beating all the women in sports is an Antifa Creepazoid.
[02:12:07.159 --> 02:12:08.520]  Look at the shirt.
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.200]  Antifa Super Soldier.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:12.722]  What a nice man.
[02:12:12.722 --> 02:12:13.422]  Got another clip.
[02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:16.147]  The worst Freudian slip in history.
[02:12:16.147 --> 02:12:19.208]  He thought Kamala Harris was bad, saying we want to depopulate people.
[02:12:19.208 --> 02:12:20.949]  That wasn't a Freudian slip.
[02:12:20.949 --> 02:12:26.552]  Dubbed grandmother of transhumanism, Barbara Max Hubbard, who called for a Luciferian world government.
[02:12:26.552 --> 02:12:28.673]  She says the babies we eat.
[02:12:28.673 --> 02:12:32.575]  She was nominated for vice president as Democrat and preached population control.
[02:12:33.869 --> 02:12:36.931]  One-fourth of humanity must be eliminated from societal body.
[02:12:36.931 --> 02:12:39.933]  We are in charge of God's selection process for the planet.
[02:12:39.933 --> 02:12:41.334]  Earth, she selects.
[02:12:41.334 --> 02:12:42.295]  We destroy.
[02:12:42.295 --> 02:12:44.056]  We are the riders of the pale horse.
[02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:44.336]  Death.
[02:12:44.336 --> 02:12:46.158]  Barbara Max Herbert wrote in her own book.
[02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:49.620]  That was 40 years ago, back when they said, we only want to kill one-fourth.
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.602]  Now they're like, we want to kill 90%.
[02:12:51.602 --> 02:12:52.922]  We're really nice people.
[02:12:52.922 --> 02:12:53.363]  Here she is.
[02:12:55.413 --> 02:13:08.745]  We are the first species on the face of this earth to be aware of evolution, to be aware that we are affecting our own evolution by everything that we do.
[02:13:08.745 --> 02:13:15.011]  The babies we eat, the food we eat, the wars we fight, the babies we eat.
[02:13:15.011 --> 02:13:19.275]  The babies we eat.
[02:13:19.275 --> 02:13:20.917]  Is that a golden noose around her neck?
[02:13:22.611 --> 02:13:24.212]  So I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:13:24.212 --> 02:13:28.796]  We got loaded phone lines here, but let's go to Charles Barkley.
[02:13:28.796 --> 02:13:32.499]  Charles Barkley, obviously in a stunt, a stage dealer, like, hey, Bud Light's collapsing.
[02:13:32.499 --> 02:13:33.880]  Everybody's tried to push it.
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:34.840]  Everybody's saying drink it.
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.742]  The more that you say drink it, the more we don't want it.
[02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:41.205]  That could be the domino that brings their whole ESG, New World Order, social credit score down.
[02:13:41.205 --> 02:13:44.268]  But you got to do it early before they get it in place.
[02:13:44.268 --> 02:13:48.531]  So Charles Barkley, who loves to play both sides, gets up there.
[02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:52.902]  And he says, the full clip's like three minutes long, I'll play a little bit of it.
[02:13:52.902 --> 02:13:55.645]  He's like, you rednecks, how dare you not drink Bud Light?
[02:13:55.645 --> 02:13:58.667]  First, Bud Light sucks.
[02:13:58.667 --> 02:14:06.494]  And I love how Modelo, Especial, that is a good Mexican beer, is now number one.
[02:14:06.494 --> 02:14:14.821]  Their ads are about families and sports heroes and firefighters and police officers and really everything we want.
[02:14:14.821 --> 02:14:17.284]  It's gone from like number six or seven to number one now.
[02:14:18.370 --> 02:14:20.491]  Because it shows what we want as marketing.
[02:14:20.491 --> 02:14:23.132]  Marketing's not just marketing, it's who we are.
[02:14:23.132 --> 02:14:26.353]  Versus Dylan Mulvaney.
[02:14:26.353 --> 02:14:33.257]  So here is Charles Barkley definitely getting his contract renewed now with the ESG.
[02:14:33.257 --> 02:14:38.959]  Up there telling you why it's the KKK if you don't want to cut little children's weenies off.
[02:14:38.959 --> 02:14:40.160]  Because that's what they're pushing.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:40.980]  That's what they're doing.
[02:14:42.421 --> 02:14:44.162]  He's like, no, no, you just don't like black people.
[02:14:44.162 --> 02:14:48.384]  So black people are defined by cutting children's genitals off.
[02:14:48.384 --> 02:14:49.645]  No, they're not.
[02:14:49.645 --> 02:14:57.369]  You're trying to define it as racist if people don't submit to depopulation, which is the most racist thing against humans ever.
[02:14:57.369 --> 02:15:00.610]  I'm a human supremacist, Charles, and you should become one too.
[02:15:00.610 --> 02:15:01.771]  You got children, right?
[02:15:01.771 --> 02:15:03.012]  You care about their future?
[02:15:03.012 --> 02:15:05.693]  Stop selling out to the system.
[02:15:05.693 --> 02:15:11.016]  I want y'all to drink this f***ing beer.
[02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:22.393]  So the new sacrament he goes on to attack rednecks and white so so
[02:15:43.652 --> 02:15:44.413]  It's a sacrifice.
[02:15:44.413 --> 02:15:45.373]  I'll bless you.
[02:15:45.373 --> 02:15:46.574]  I want you to drink this bit.
[02:15:46.574 --> 02:15:47.755]  No, sir.
[02:15:47.755 --> 02:15:50.297]  I predict Bud Light goes down even further.
[02:15:50.297 --> 02:15:51.298]  So does Anheuser-Busch.
[02:15:51.298 --> 02:15:59.724]  And I predict Charles Barkley, who's already a joke, is an even bigger joke.
[02:15:59.724 --> 02:16:02.726]  Here's another article, full video at InfoWars.com.
[02:16:02.726 --> 02:16:09.171]  Woman poses as girl, bus, New York City health care provider, offering kids trans services.
[02:16:09.171 --> 02:16:11.153]  So the girl calls up and talks about birth control.
[02:16:12.523 --> 02:16:16.365]  Posing as a little girl, and they say, hey, how about we just cut your breast off?
[02:16:16.365 --> 02:16:21.348]  Come on in.
[02:16:21.348 --> 02:16:22.949]  So she calls up and says, I'm underage.
[02:16:22.949 --> 02:16:23.489]  Well, don't worry.
[02:16:23.489 --> 02:16:26.351]  We'll come in here and we'll cut your uterus out.
[02:16:26.351 --> 02:16:29.753]  Want to hear the audio?
[02:16:29.753 --> 02:16:34.355]  So, see, Charles Barkley thought about us not loving the gay people.
[02:16:34.355 --> 02:16:38.077]  It's about the system and the corporations coming after the children.
[02:16:38.077 --> 02:16:40.339]  And now Charles Barkley signed on to the pedo wagon.
[02:16:41.431 --> 02:16:47.958]  He just signed on to the whole sick agenda while everybody else is jumping ship.
[02:16:47.958 --> 02:16:50.100]  That's quite the IQ test.
[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:55.566]  But they're not just killing us with GMO and 5G and sterile chemicals in the water.
[02:16:55.566 --> 02:16:57.188]  They're killing us with the fentanyl.
[02:16:57.188 --> 02:17:00.872]  Let's show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[02:17:00.872 --> 02:17:02.073]  There's thousands of these videos.
[02:17:02.073 --> 02:17:02.734]  This is the latest one.
[02:17:04.145 --> 02:17:12.952]  Of black, white, hispanic, old, young, literal zombies on drugs that kill them within a few years, if they're lucky.
[02:17:12.952 --> 02:17:17.036]  George Floyd was on this, but we didn't make that his cause of death, even though the coroner said so.
[02:17:17.036 --> 02:17:18.557]  No, it was a cop.
[02:17:18.557 --> 02:17:19.398]  It's his fault.
[02:17:19.398 --> 02:17:21.539]  So don't stop the drugs.
[02:17:21.539 --> 02:17:24.922]  Just talk about white people all day, right?
[02:17:24.922 --> 02:17:25.623]  Charles Barkley?
[02:17:25.623 --> 02:17:28.025]  Because that's the script you're given to say?
[02:17:30.083 --> 02:17:32.004]  Should I stand up for humanity?
[02:17:32.004 --> 02:17:41.927]  Here's footage in London of a man dressed as a woman with a giant black dildo in front of dozens of little children ages six months to five years.
[02:17:41.927 --> 02:17:43.147]  Parental discretion is advised.
[02:17:43.147 --> 02:17:43.407]  Roll it.
[02:17:56.491 --> 02:18:02.695]  So ugly men dress as prostitutes, committing sex acts in front of children.
[02:18:02.695 --> 02:18:07.838]  I thought women were supposed to protect their kids from that, but now they get women to think it's trendy?
[02:18:07.838 --> 02:18:16.584]  Let pedo-supporting type culture groom your children.
[02:18:16.584 --> 02:18:18.105]  Absolutely disgusting.
[02:18:18.105 --> 02:18:20.487]  Here's Serena Williams, top women's
[02:18:21.641 --> 02:18:29.987]  All time tennis champion because they had transgender men come out and challenge her and say, no, no, no, men can compete against women.
[02:18:29.987 --> 02:18:33.690]  And she said, no, men in tennis are a whole nother level we can't.
[02:18:33.690 --> 02:18:36.532]  And now the media is attacking her saying, well, there are no men or women.
[02:18:36.532 --> 02:18:38.053]  They're stealing your identity.
[02:18:38.053 --> 02:18:43.177]  I know this is simple for our audience, but the general public doesn't get how fundamental this is.
[02:18:43.177 --> 02:18:43.858]  Here's Serena Williams.
[02:18:44.992 --> 02:18:49.056]  Oh, he was been joking about myself and him playing a match.
[02:18:49.056 --> 02:18:52.099]  And I'm like, Andy, seriously, like, are you kidding me?
[02:18:52.099 --> 02:18:57.124]  Because for me, tennis and men's tennis and women's tennis are completely almost two separate sports.
[02:18:57.124 --> 02:19:04.511]  So I'm like, if I were to play Andy Murray, I would lose 6-0, 6-0 in five to six minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
[02:19:04.511 --> 02:19:06.432]  Because it's true.
[02:19:06.432 --> 02:19:06.973]  It's completely.
[02:19:08.274 --> 02:19:10.115]  It's a completely different sport.
[02:19:10.115 --> 02:19:12.015]  The men are a lot faster.
[02:19:12.015 --> 02:19:15.256]  And they serve harder, they hit harder.
[02:19:15.256 --> 02:19:16.337]  It's just a different game.
[02:19:16.337 --> 02:19:19.298]  And I love to play women's tennis.
[02:19:19.298 --> 02:19:21.679]  I only want to play girls because I don't want to be embarrassed.
[02:19:21.679 --> 02:19:23.399]  I would not do the tour.
[02:19:23.399 --> 02:19:25.160]  I wouldn't do Billie Jean, any justice.
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:27.121]  So Andy, stop it.
[02:19:27.121 --> 02:19:29.221]  I'm not going to let you kill me.
[02:19:29.221 --> 02:19:34.083]  I mean, it's almost like saying a pit bull's tougher than a chihuahua.
[02:19:37.105 --> 02:19:39.007]  Or a mouse.
[02:19:39.007 --> 02:19:43.891]  I mean, we can't have babies, but women can't compete against men.
[02:19:43.891 --> 02:19:48.335]  And it's an overstatement of the obvious.
[02:19:48.335 --> 02:19:58.664]  But now in South Korea, a man who had his penis cut off so he could do it, went and won the National Cycling Championship.
[02:19:59.707 --> 02:20:08.218]  When he was ranked multi-thousands in the mail and he did it he said to bring attention to the fact that this is a fraud and is disgraceful.
[02:20:08.218 --> 02:20:10.681]  Had to get his penis cut off just to make the point.
[02:20:10.681 --> 02:20:11.302]  Wow.
[02:20:11.302 --> 02:20:12.063]  That's dedication.
[02:20:13.237 --> 02:20:25.229]  Look at this, Team Canada's powerlifting coach Avi Silverberg just broke the Alberta woman's bench press record by 84 kilogram category at the Heroes Classic.
[02:20:25.229 --> 02:20:27.491]  Former record holder, trans-identifying male.
[02:20:30.299 --> 02:20:30.839]  I think so.
[02:20:59.062 --> 02:21:00.563]  Here's the story I told you about.
[02:21:00.563 --> 02:21:08.706]  First Korean transgender athlete wins women's cycling competition and delivers a shocking message to the world.
[02:21:08.706 --> 02:21:14.408]  And for the Koreans to let him in the race, he had to cut his penis off.
[02:21:14.408 --> 02:21:16.569]  Cut his penis off to prove it.
[02:21:16.569 --> 02:21:17.330]  That's dedication.
[02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:18.910]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:26.273]  And then went and won, and he's not even a top contender in men's cycling.
[02:21:26.273 --> 02:21:27.094]  That's some dedication.
[02:21:27.844 --> 02:21:31.387]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls for the balance of the hour into the next hour.
[02:21:31.387 --> 02:21:38.512]  I appreciate everybody holding so patiently and so nicely, and so I'm going to take your calls, the order they are received.
[02:21:38.512 --> 02:21:51.543]  We're talking about the looming Trump indictment that Trump says is imminent, and he's told us so far in the last two, for January 6th, and what that imports when Trump famously said, march peacefully to the Capitol.
[02:21:51.543 --> 02:21:52.363]  That's your right?
[02:21:52.363 --> 02:21:54.045]  First Amendment?
[02:21:54.045 --> 02:21:55.206]  Not according to Jack Smith.
[02:21:56.581 --> 02:21:57.562]  He's a lawyer.
[02:21:57.562 --> 02:21:58.142]  He's a U.N.
[02:21:58.142 --> 02:21:58.663]  bureaucrat.
[02:21:58.663 --> 02:21:59.743]  He's God.
[02:21:59.743 --> 02:22:03.166]  You sit down, Americans, and you shut up and keep your mouth shut.
[02:22:03.166 --> 02:22:05.628]  All right?
[02:22:05.628 --> 02:22:06.769]  Don't you understand?
[02:22:06.769 --> 02:22:08.710]  They went to Harvard, so they rule you.
[02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:12.313]  It's a Harvard mafia, folks.
[02:22:12.313 --> 02:22:13.734]  People ask you who runs the New World Order?
[02:22:13.734 --> 02:22:15.095]  Harvard.
[02:22:15.095 --> 02:22:17.817]  Seriously, that's the guys.
[02:22:17.817 --> 02:22:18.698]  That's the people.
[02:22:18.698 --> 02:22:21.360]  They're bad, bad, bad, man.
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.441]  Woo!
[02:22:22.441 --> 02:22:24.523]  They rolled out poison shots against our people.
[02:22:25.367 --> 02:22:29.268]  I mean, they are bad, bad, bad.
[02:22:29.268 --> 02:22:33.470]  Jeremy in FEMA Region 5, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:22:33.470 --> 02:22:41.872]  Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.
[02:22:41.872 --> 02:22:44.453]  Alex, you and I both know Trump is in the way.
[02:22:44.453 --> 02:22:47.374]  He stands in between them and us.
[02:22:47.374 --> 02:22:49.635]  They get Trump out of the way, they get us.
[02:22:50.205 --> 02:22:55.791]  But unfortunately, their fluoride, their jab hasn't worked on the mask.
[02:22:55.791 --> 02:23:00.176]  There's a majority of patriots out there that are going to stand up and fight.
[02:23:00.176 --> 02:23:04.040]  If they take Trump down, that's going to be the last straw for a lot of these patriots.
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:06.262]  I'm not saying it's my last straw.
[02:23:06.262 --> 02:23:08.144]  I'm a peaceful man.
[02:23:08.144 --> 02:23:10.767]  If it finally gets to that, I'll
[02:23:12.338 --> 02:23:13.719]  Go down that road when I get there.
[02:23:13.719 --> 02:23:14.280]  No, I hear you.
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:17.082]  I mean, clearly Trump's not perfect, but they hate him legitimately.
[02:23:17.082 --> 02:23:18.803]  They hate RFK legitimately.
[02:23:18.803 --> 02:23:20.545]  There's no way RFK's on their side.
[02:23:20.545 --> 02:23:23.167]  They murdered his dad and uncle.
[02:23:23.167 --> 02:23:23.607]  Exactly.
[02:23:23.607 --> 02:23:25.268]  There is absolutely no way.
[02:23:25.268 --> 02:23:27.510]  They're going to take Trump down.
[02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:28.951]  They're going to take RFK down.
[02:23:28.951 --> 02:23:32.314]  They're going to stop them from getting in office, whatever they can do, because they know
[02:23:32.833 --> 02:23:37.196]  That the people support them, and so they will be the voice of the people.
[02:23:37.196 --> 02:23:38.957]  But how are they going to manage that?
[02:23:38.957 --> 02:23:43.300]  I mean, Trump has the highest approval ratings ever recorded.
[02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:46.623]  They're going to assassinate him, in my opinion.
[02:23:46.623 --> 02:23:50.185]  If they can't get him... Well, I mean, I said that a month ago, and the media was like, that's crazy.
[02:23:50.185 --> 02:23:52.527]  No, that's what political assassination is.
[02:23:52.527 --> 02:23:56.209]  When a system can't beat somebody, they kill them or try.
[02:23:56.209 --> 02:23:57.791]  Alex, two years ago, I had a vision.
[02:23:57.791 --> 02:23:59.732]  I saw Trump, and he got shot in the head.
[02:24:00.339 --> 02:24:03.080]  And God was telling me that they're going to assassinate him.
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.360]  It might not be physically.
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:06.581]  It could be, like you said, politically.
[02:24:06.581 --> 02:24:07.581]  It could be legally.
[02:24:07.581 --> 02:24:09.222]  They're going to derail him.
[02:24:09.222 --> 02:24:21.606]  He's an unstoppable force that is going to penetrate right through their darkness and then it's going to let our light shine forth because they are trying to hold back the light that we have inside of us.
[02:24:21.606 --> 02:24:22.426]  No, I agree with you.
[02:24:22.426 --> 02:24:23.026]  I agree with you.
[02:24:23.026 --> 02:24:24.146]  And evil's not all-powerful.
[02:24:24.146 --> 02:24:25.047]  Pray for President Trump.
[02:24:25.047 --> 02:24:26.227]  Thank you, Jeremy.
[02:24:26.227 --> 02:24:27.508]  Let's go to Justin in Missouri.
[02:24:27.508 --> 02:24:28.368]  Justin, thanks for calling.
[02:24:28.368 --> 02:24:28.608]  Go ahead.
[02:24:31.275 --> 02:24:35.077]  We're talking about Trump and all the parallels with the JFK thing.
[02:24:35.077 --> 02:24:39.420]  It's like if anybody ever really wondered why there's no answer to who killed him, think about it.
[02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:40.721]  Everybody hates Trump.
[02:24:40.721 --> 02:24:42.943]  It's got to be the same atmosphere that it was back then.
[02:24:44.318 --> 02:24:51.025]  Yeah, Kennedy was wildly popular, pulling us out of Vietnam, and more importantly, he was calling the shots.
[02:24:51.025 --> 02:24:52.026]  He was the president.
[02:24:52.026 --> 02:24:54.228]  He would tell the generals, no, you don't tell me.
[02:24:54.228 --> 02:24:55.730]  He'd tell the bureaucrats, no.
[02:24:55.730 --> 02:25:00.935]  He'd tell the Carnegie and Ford endowment and the Rockefeller endowment, no, I'm in charge.
[02:25:00.935 --> 02:25:01.716]  They went, really?
[02:25:01.716 --> 02:25:02.677]  You die.
[02:25:02.677 --> 02:25:05.900]  And then Nixon got in later after LBJ.
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:06.841]  He tried to be president.
[02:25:06.841 --> 02:25:07.462]  They got rid of him.
[02:25:09.372 --> 02:25:14.677]  Exactly, and so it's just, if something's coming for these guys, RFK Jr.
[02:25:14.677 --> 02:25:16.338]  and Trump, they can't have it.
[02:25:16.338 --> 02:25:17.479]  So, I mean, that's just obvious.
[02:25:17.479 --> 02:25:19.141]  But can you believe how history works?
[02:25:19.141 --> 02:25:25.286]  That the Deep State killed the Kennedys, and now their scion is battling and is incredibly articulate.
[02:25:25.286 --> 02:25:30.170]  Then we got Trump, that's got to really scare them, because they're going to have to kill both of them.
[02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:35.175]  Exactly, and it's like, when people talk the grudge thing, it's like a grudge match between Trump and this guy.
[02:25:35.999 --> 02:25:37.580]  Come on, they killed his dad and his uncle.
[02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:38.481]  That's a grudge, Jack.
[02:25:38.481 --> 02:25:43.685]  So, anybody that thinks he's playing ball with these people is just out of their mind.
[02:25:43.685 --> 02:25:48.009]  Yeah, I don't mean he's perfect either, but I mean, definitely RFK's the real deal.
[02:25:48.009 --> 02:25:50.030]  So, Trump, so how do you see this unfolding?
[02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:53.673]  How do we stop the deep state from trying to kill him?
[02:25:53.673 --> 02:25:55.335]  Well, I think it's the obvious again.
[02:25:55.335 --> 02:25:57.536]  Should Trump and RFK Jr.
[02:25:57.536 --> 02:26:00.559]  get past all of their attempts to stop them, whatever those may be,
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:02.981]  I think they have to unify.
[02:26:02.981 --> 02:26:04.082]  I mean, that's obvious.
[02:26:04.082 --> 02:26:04.623]  No, I agree.
[02:26:04.623 --> 02:26:06.524]  One of them should be the Vice President, one the President.
[02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:10.127]  And let me tell you, they got it rigged against Democrats.
[02:26:10.127 --> 02:26:12.229]  I don't like Bernie Sanders, but he was the nominee.
[02:26:12.229 --> 02:26:13.009]  They stole it.
[02:26:13.009 --> 02:26:15.031]  So they're going to take it from RFK Jr.
[02:26:15.031 --> 02:26:17.052]  And I think at that point, RFK Jr.
[02:26:17.052 --> 02:26:18.954]  should switch over to his VP.
[02:26:18.954 --> 02:26:20.815]  They'll have to kill them both.
[02:26:20.815 --> 02:26:23.697]  I mean, that is an incredible ticket.
[02:26:23.697 --> 02:26:25.219]  So how do they think, though?
[02:26:25.219 --> 02:26:26.800]  And another thing I'm curious about is,
[02:26:28.078 --> 02:26:33.001]  Well, I mean, normally New Hampshire and Iowa have these special caucuses and things to see who the frontrunner is.
[02:26:33.001 --> 02:26:34.042]  Democrats have gotten rid of that.
[02:26:44.810 --> 02:26:47.213]  Bernie Sanders won those, and he won California.
[02:26:47.213 --> 02:26:48.755]  That's at the end.
[02:26:48.755 --> 02:26:50.277]  And they just said, we don't care.
[02:26:50.277 --> 02:26:53.260]  The electors got together and decided it's going to be Hillary.
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:56.564]  That's why Trump went, well, fine, I'll get the electors decided it's me.
[02:26:56.564 --> 02:26:58.847]  And Jack Smith's like, no, we're going to arrest you.
[02:26:58.847 --> 02:27:02.712]  But the Democrats did exactly what Trump tried, which I think was a little
[02:27:03.372 --> 02:27:11.316]  I don't really agree with having electors ignore the popular vote, but Trump was saying, well, you've done it, I'll do it, because the popular vote was a fraud, but it was still weird.
[02:27:11.316 --> 02:27:12.156]  It was a gray area.
[02:27:12.156 --> 02:27:14.997]  But the point is, Trump was copying what Democrats have done.
[02:27:14.997 --> 02:27:16.818]  Does that make sense?
[02:27:16.818 --> 02:27:18.299]  Yes, it does.
[02:27:18.299 --> 02:27:20.420]  Alex, do you have time for one point?
[02:27:20.420 --> 02:27:20.780]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:23.641]  That's not on this subject.
[02:27:23.641 --> 02:27:29.344]  I know that you missed last time the big run in Bitcoin and Max Keiser was on you about it.
[02:27:29.344 --> 02:27:32.425]  I don't know if you have anybody that keeps up with this stuff or what's going on.
[02:27:33.246 --> 02:27:36.278]  But the SEC just lost their case against the big one, XRP.
[02:27:37.842 --> 02:27:41.824]  And, you know, over the next couple of years, that could put you in the black permanent.
[02:27:41.824 --> 02:27:43.264]  That's just a suggestion.
[02:27:43.264 --> 02:27:46.986]  Well, we wouldn't be here except for the Bitcoin donations.
[02:27:46.986 --> 02:27:51.267]  And so people can go to InfoWars.com forward slash crypto and make donations.
[02:27:51.267 --> 02:27:51.947]  We're very thankful.
[02:27:51.947 --> 02:27:53.508]  I don't plan to be an expert on it.
[02:27:53.508 --> 02:27:56.169]  I had to study all this other stuff for decades, what I'm talking about.
[02:27:56.169 --> 02:27:58.710]  And the cryptocurrency gives me a headache.
[02:27:58.710 --> 02:28:00.571]  So I'm smart enough to tell you I don't understand it all.
[02:28:00.571 --> 02:28:01.511]  But we do take donations.
[02:28:01.511 --> 02:28:03.532]  And I really appreciate your support.
[02:28:03.532 --> 02:28:03.912]  All right.
[02:28:03.912 --> 02:28:05.693]  Here's the deal.
[02:28:05.693 --> 02:28:06.273]  We're going to go on a break.
[02:28:06.977 --> 02:28:21.981]  We're going to come back and go to Robert, and then we're going to go to Joey, and we're going to go to Daryl, and Bob, and Vic, and Savicks, and Carlos, and Misha, and Mark, in the order they're received.
[02:28:21.981 --> 02:28:33.585]  So stay tuned with us, and please remember, three years not having it in stock, finally back, the original, 30 parts per million, the highest quality coiled silver, such a great useful thing in your life.
[02:28:34.966 --> 02:28:36.147]  Back in stock.

[02:28:50.559 --> 02:28:50.960]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.725 --> 02:28:59.927]  The globalists are only humans.
[02:28:59.927 --> 02:29:03.929]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[02:29:03.929 --> 02:29:07.131]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[02:29:07.131 --> 02:29:15.357]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[02:29:15.357 --> 02:29:18.940]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:19.800]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[02:29:21.161 --> 02:29:23.862]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[02:29:23.862 --> 02:29:28.443]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:28.443 --> 02:29:30.443]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[02:29:30.443 --> 02:29:32.584]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[02:29:32.584 --> 02:29:35.384]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.

[02:29:47.009 --> 02:29:54.001]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[02:29:54.001 --> 02:29:56.465]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[02:29:59.349 --> 02:30:05.693]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:05.693 --> 02:30:10.716]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get them individually.
[02:30:10.716 --> 02:30:13.378]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[02:30:13.378 --> 02:30:14.819]  Two separate formulas.
[02:30:14.819 --> 02:30:17.401]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[02:30:18.041 --> 02:30:23.644]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again with no hangover or letdown.
[02:30:23.644 --> 02:30:29.227]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits really, really quick.
[02:30:29.227 --> 02:30:29.687]  And I love it.
[02:30:29.687 --> 02:30:31.148]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[02:30:31.148 --> 02:30:35.410]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[02:30:35.410 --> 02:30:38.572]  Got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and boom!
[02:30:39.572 --> 02:30:39.873]  I think so.
[02:31:00.532 --> 02:31:02.074]  Or like a vitamin shop.
[02:31:02.074 --> 02:31:04.036]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:31:04.036 --> 02:31:06.079]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:31:06.079 --> 02:31:08.562]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:31:08.562 --> 02:31:09.383]  Hey, what's better?
[02:31:09.383 --> 02:31:10.224]  Knockout?
[02:31:10.224 --> 02:31:11.565]  What's better?
[02:31:11.565 --> 02:31:12.306]  Down and out?
[02:31:12.306 --> 02:31:12.847]  What's better?
[02:31:12.847 --> 02:31:15.110]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:20.036]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:31:20.726 --> 02:31:24.691]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:31:24.691 --> 02:31:26.032]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:31:26.032 --> 02:31:27.334]  They're all very diverse.
[02:31:27.334 --> 02:31:37.525]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.
[02:31:38.246 --> 02:31:43.872]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.

[02:31:48.416 --> 02:31:52.400]  So get your M4 Wars MD, good night's sleep today, at m4warsware.com.
[02:32:02.685 --> 02:32:04.087]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:32:04.087 --> 02:32:06.011]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:32:06.011 --> 02:32:06.592]  It is!
[02:32:06.592 --> 02:32:08.134]  But if you took it with bish oil...
[02:32:09.435 --> 02:32:11.476]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[02:32:11.476 --> 02:32:12.796]  The fish oil's better than it.
[02:32:12.796 --> 02:32:14.636]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:32:14.636 --> 02:32:17.117]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:32:17.117 --> 02:32:18.737]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:32:18.737 --> 02:32:20.237]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:32:20.237 --> 02:32:21.698]  Krill oils is the best.
[02:32:21.698 --> 02:32:23.058]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:32:23.058 --> 02:32:23.938]  And I'm sorry.
[02:32:23.938 --> 02:32:24.919]  You want something like this?
[02:32:24.919 --> 02:32:25.879]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:32:25.879 --> 02:32:27.799]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:32:27.799 --> 02:32:28.419]  It's so good.
[02:32:28.419 --> 02:32:29.019]  In my view.
[02:32:29.019 --> 02:32:31.240]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:34.061]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:32:34.061 --> 02:32:35.641]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:32:37.446 --> 02:32:44.951]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:32:44.951 --> 02:32:50.994]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:32:50.994 --> 02:32:52.115]  I just can't do it!
[02:32:52.115 --> 02:32:59.339]  Infowarsstore.com!
[02:32:59.339 --> 02:33:05.243]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.284 --> 02:33:21.967]  Woe to you, O Earth and Sea, for the Devil sends the Beast with wrath, because he knows the time is short.
[02:33:21.967 --> 02:33:28.909]  Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the Beast, for it is a human number.
[02:33:28.909 --> 02:33:30.269]  Its number is 666.
[02:33:40.753 --> 02:33:46.277]  We're halfway into the third hour on this Tuesday, July 18th, Twin Way 3 Transmission.
[02:33:46.277 --> 02:33:48.358]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.358 --> 02:33:51.720]  What a wild, crazy time to be alive.
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:34:00.545]  We got Zelensky, Pentagon acknowledged counter-offensive had to be paused amid major losses.
[02:34:00.545 --> 02:34:06.409]  Biden, meanwhile, approves pumping another $1.3 billion in arms in a stalemate Ukraine war.
[02:34:09.454 --> 02:34:14.557]  Just gets crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[02:34:14.557 --> 02:34:17.499]  Let's go right back to your phone calls right now.
[02:34:17.499 --> 02:34:19.160]  Let's talk to Robert in New York.
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:20.181]  Robert, thanks for calling.
[02:34:20.181 --> 02:34:21.362]  Go ahead.
[02:34:21.362 --> 02:34:22.122]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:22.122 --> 02:34:24.204]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:34:24.204 --> 02:34:28.447]  In terms of the Trump pending indictment, three points.
[02:34:28.447 --> 02:34:32.389]  Point number one is it's very obvious what they want to do.
[02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:36.512]  There's no way they're going to let Trump or Kennedy win the nomination.
[02:34:37.071 --> 02:34:44.593]  Now, in the case of Kennedy, they could easily take out Kennedy by having Biden win, and he's the president, everything is stacked for him.
[02:34:44.593 --> 02:34:50.815]  In terms of Trump, it's obvious there's no way he could lose unless they don't legally let him run.
[02:34:50.815 --> 02:34:53.696]  It's obvious that what they do to Trump is what they did to Bolsonaro.
[02:34:54.276 --> 02:34:55.057]  We're good to go.
[02:35:13.613 --> 02:35:19.663]  And this ruthless Republican establishment, who'll be worse than the Democrat, he will defeat Biden.
[02:35:19.663 --> 02:35:20.925]  That's no big secret.
[02:35:20.925 --> 02:35:26.714]  And when this horrible rhino gets in, that's when the false flags are going to take place.
[02:35:27.355 --> 02:35:28.756]  So, no, no, no.
[02:35:28.756 --> 02:35:33.518]  They're not going to have Mike, Big Mike, or they're not going to have Gavin Newsom.
[02:35:33.518 --> 02:35:38.121]  They want Biden to lose the general election, but they want him to defeat Kennedy.
[02:35:38.121 --> 02:35:42.063]  Now, the question is, what could we do about it, and what should Trump do about it?
[02:35:42.063 --> 02:35:43.964]  Now, in terms of what Trump should do about it,
[02:35:44.444 --> 02:35:47.007]  Trump better get a very good legal team.
[02:35:47.007 --> 02:35:51.431]  Now, Giuliani, they're looking to take away his ability to practice law, I heard, in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:51.431 --> 02:35:53.433]  They already took him out in New York City.
[02:35:53.433 --> 02:35:56.136]  Now they want to mess around with him in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:56.136 --> 02:36:00.681]  He better get a good team of lawyers, because Roger Stone pointed out he has a very weak team.
[02:36:01.341 --> 02:36:08.243]  And he better fight very hard, legally, not to get out of that venue in Washington, D.C.
[02:36:08.243 --> 02:36:09.563]  Because that's a kangaroo.
[02:36:09.563 --> 02:36:11.403]  That's a kangaroo.
[02:36:11.403 --> 02:36:12.463]  That's a joke.
[02:36:12.463 --> 02:36:13.884]  He has to do everything he can.
[02:36:13.884 --> 02:36:15.624]  He should appeal to the Supreme Court.
[02:36:15.624 --> 02:36:23.026]  He should have everything he can do to highlight that there's no way he can get a fair shake in Washington, D.C.
[02:36:24.946 --> 02:36:26.527]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:36:26.527 --> 02:36:32.270]  And the old saying of kangaroo courts in Australia comes from Australia is all railroads and kangaroos.
[02:36:32.270 --> 02:36:34.431]  They railroad you right into conviction.
[02:36:34.431 --> 02:36:34.831]  Thank you.
[02:36:34.831 --> 02:36:35.391]  Great points.
[02:36:35.391 --> 02:36:36.452]  Amazing, Robert.
[02:36:36.452 --> 02:36:37.633]  I totally agree with you.
[02:36:37.633 --> 02:36:38.493]  Bob in New York.
[02:36:38.493 --> 02:36:39.133]  You're on the air.
[02:36:39.133 --> 02:36:40.714]  Go ahead.
[02:36:40.714 --> 02:36:42.015]  Hey, Alex.
[02:36:42.015 --> 02:36:42.715]  Love you, man.
[02:36:42.715 --> 02:36:43.996]  Love you.
[02:36:43.996 --> 02:36:46.617]  And I wanted to stay on your topic with Trump.
[02:36:46.617 --> 02:36:51.740]  And I feel that the moves that are being played out against him
[02:36:52.646 --> 02:36:56.989]  Are really just kicking the can, the deep state kicking the can down the road.
[02:36:56.989 --> 02:37:01.532]  They're running out of moves, and they have to distract from all the other things that are coming out.
[02:37:01.532 --> 02:37:08.055]  They don't talk about the number one movie in the country, a $15 million film that makes $100 million.
[02:37:08.055 --> 02:37:14.119]  They don't talk about what Tim Ballard and Jim Caviezel are talking about when they get interviewed.
[02:37:14.119 --> 02:37:20.903]  They're mentioning the organ harvesting, the blood, the 15 rapes, the marrow, the adrenochrome.
[02:37:20.903 --> 02:37:22.104]  They're talking about this stuff.
[02:37:22.682 --> 02:37:24.804]  It's being left on YouTube, somehow.
[02:37:24.804 --> 02:37:27.827]  It's not... It's being... No, you're right.
[02:37:27.827 --> 02:37:33.331]  Everywhere the truth's coming out, the Deep State New World Order is burning down in front of our eyes.
[02:37:33.331 --> 02:37:34.673]  Absolutely.
[02:37:34.673 --> 02:37:48.785]  And the only thing that they have to get at us is to go after the fearless leader, the one who, in my opinion, really just keeps his mouth tightly closed, doesn't talk about all this stuff because it's not time to.
[02:37:49.269 --> 02:37:54.033]  Get one person or this one or a Weiner's laptop or Hunter Biden.
[02:37:54.033 --> 02:37:58.757]  The only time that it's going to come forward is in God's timing.
[02:37:58.757 --> 02:38:00.138]  And you see God's hand moving.
[02:38:00.138 --> 02:38:01.920]  We see God's hand working.
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:03.361]  And that's something I want to say.
[02:38:03.361 --> 02:38:07.725]  Despite how dark things are and how bad they are, we're seeing record awakening.
[02:38:07.725 --> 02:38:09.527]  The globalists, they're in trouble.
[02:38:09.527 --> 02:38:11.608]  That's why I'm saying they're going to counter strike.
[02:38:11.608 --> 02:38:13.850]  And that's why this is so crazy.
[02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:14.291]  Yeah.
[02:38:14.291 --> 02:38:16.653]  And there are a lot of things that he doesn't talk about that
[02:38:17.629 --> 02:38:18.569]  Other people are.
[02:38:18.569 --> 02:38:19.750]  I mean, I'll say it.
[02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:21.670]  I'm Q-adjacent, right?
[02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:30.053]  So you talk about Executive Order 13838, which talks about relieving people of their ill-gotten gains.
[02:38:30.053 --> 02:38:33.034]  You talk about who are the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:38:33.034 --> 02:38:35.615]  If you look now, they were appointed in 2019.
[02:38:35.615 --> 02:38:42.637]  Now, if you were Joe Biden, wouldn't you get rid of Trump's Joint Chiefs of Staff?
[02:38:42.637 --> 02:38:45.638]  Of course, Milley was in there, but, you know, I think also Pence's
[02:38:46.531 --> 02:38:46.671]  It's
[02:39:05.073 --> 02:39:06.995]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:06.995 --> 02:39:11.159]  I mean, a lot of what you're saying I agree with, some I don't.
[02:39:11.159 --> 02:39:15.263]  The fact that Trump knows everything works as his master super genius is not true.
[02:39:15.263 --> 02:39:19.907]  He thinks about freedom, he cares about the country, but it's not 3D chess.
[02:39:19.907 --> 02:39:22.850]  He brought in all sorts of folks that were bad because he didn't know.
[02:39:22.850 --> 02:39:24.372]  Once we warned him, he'd try to get rid of them.
[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:29.981]  Trump's got it all handled.
[02:39:29.981 --> 02:39:30.681]  Everything's fine.
[02:39:30.681 --> 02:39:31.762]  Everything's beautiful.
[02:39:31.762 --> 02:39:32.582]  It's not the case.
[02:39:32.582 --> 02:39:42.387]  It's that evil's not that powerful, and that if we all take action and speak up and don't submit and pray to God and do the right thing, we'll beat this.
[02:39:42.387 --> 02:39:43.908]  Let's talk to Mark in Utah.
[02:39:43.908 --> 02:39:44.588]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:39:44.588 --> 02:39:45.969]  Go ahead.
[02:39:45.969 --> 02:39:46.649]  Yes.
[02:39:46.649 --> 02:39:48.730]  I'm just going to bring up these two quick points.
[02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:55.654]  With Tom Hanks and his bosom buddies, Alex, there was a TV show around 40 years ago, and he mostly played a woman.
[02:39:56.292 --> 02:39:59.053]  Throughout the show, Tom Hanks did that.
[02:39:59.053 --> 02:40:03.274]  That's where he really got his start, if I'm not mistaken, was with Bosom Buddies.
[02:40:03.274 --> 02:40:05.075]  Your crew could look that up.
[02:40:05.075 --> 02:40:16.498]  Now, the other point I just want to bring up, this is separate, because you keep saying things about JFK and the father, and then, okay.
[02:40:16.498 --> 02:40:20.319]  I believe JFK Jr., in my opinion, was killed.
[02:40:20.319 --> 02:40:23.600]  I don't remember some form of assassination.
[02:40:24.113 --> 02:40:33.897]  Because I don't remember ever hearing any plane found, any body found, JFK Jr., his wife, the baby, his sister-in-law.
[02:40:33.897 --> 02:40:38.999]  OK, they were going towards, I think it's, I call it the compound in Massachusetts.
[02:40:38.999 --> 02:40:39.580]  OK.
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:45.942]  And the plane, in bad weather, I think, to come to the bad weather and they died, supposedly.
[02:40:45.942 --> 02:40:49.504]  But I don't remember ever hearing a finding luggage, finding the body.
[02:40:50.246 --> 02:40:51.667]  Or finding the plane.
[02:40:51.667 --> 02:40:52.668]  If you could add to that later.
[02:40:52.668 --> 02:40:54.730]  That's a very popular idea that he was murdered.
[02:40:54.730 --> 02:40:55.791]  I wouldn't put it past him.
[02:40:55.791 --> 02:40:57.212]  So what are you saying?
[02:40:57.212 --> 02:41:04.639]  In my opinion, if they didn't find anything, I believe 99% he was probably assassinated.
[02:41:04.639 --> 02:41:05.960]  So what does that mean?
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.001]  How does that affect today?
[02:41:08.137 --> 02:41:11.959]  No, no, I'm just bringing that out.
[02:41:11.959 --> 02:41:15.981]  You've been bringing up lately the Kennedys, so I'm just throwing that out.
[02:41:15.981 --> 02:41:17.681]  He was going to run for president, you know.
[02:41:17.681 --> 02:41:17.922]  Sure.
[02:41:17.922 --> 02:41:19.322]  He had a lot of support.
[02:41:19.322 --> 02:41:20.363]  Excuse me?
[02:41:20.363 --> 02:41:21.343]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:41:21.343 --> 02:41:23.384]  I think they probably did murder him.
[02:41:23.384 --> 02:41:24.525]  Yeah, that's what I believe.
[02:41:24.525 --> 02:41:26.986]  Okay, can I go to my real point, please?
[02:41:26.986 --> 02:41:27.226]  Okay.
[02:41:27.611 --> 02:41:28.411]  I don't know.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:51.361]  And he was tried in absentia by the Missouri and the governor of Missouri.
[02:41:51.361 --> 02:41:52.762]  And listen to this for one minute.
[02:41:52.762 --> 02:41:53.682]  You could have your crew.
[02:41:53.682 --> 02:41:55.482]  I wish you would have your crew look it up.
[02:41:55.482 --> 02:41:58.083]  Because that's why I bring these points up to you, Alex.
[02:41:58.083 --> 02:41:58.803]  Okay?
[02:41:58.803 --> 02:42:08.685]  What I'm bringing up to you is the New Yorker, the New Yorker magazine, in 2019, the March edition, will say that Joseph Smith
[02:42:09.392 --> 02:42:11.273]  Alright, we're going to go on a break.
[02:42:34.252 --> 02:42:38.517]  Vic, Savicks, Carlos, Daryl, Joey, we're taking your calls.
[02:42:38.517 --> 02:42:39.718]  The order, they are received.
[02:42:39.718 --> 02:42:45.043]  I'll host a little bit in the next hour with some other breaking news, and then hand the baton to our special guest.
[02:42:45.043 --> 02:42:46.445]  Then, at 3 p.m.
[02:42:46.445 --> 02:42:53.652]  Central, in about an hour and 20 minutes, Owen Schroyer with The War Room takes over InfoWars.com.
[02:42:53.652 --> 02:42:55.694]  Please, link to his show and promote it.
[02:42:55.694 --> 02:42:56.996]  He's covering critical information.
[02:42:58.183 --> 02:43:07.713]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:43:07.713 --> 02:43:13.019]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[02:43:13.459 --> 02:43:15.140]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:18.121]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:43:18.121 --> 02:43:19.762]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[02:43:19.762 --> 02:43:24.664]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[02:43:24.664 --> 02:43:26.404]  This is something you need now.
[02:43:26.404 --> 02:43:30.986]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[02:43:30.986 --> 02:43:36.688]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[02:43:36.688 --> 02:43:42.851]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[02:43:43.231 --> 02:43:44.613]  And air filtration.
[02:43:44.613 --> 02:43:47.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[02:43:47.277 --> 02:43:48.578]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[02:43:48.578 --> 02:43:51.462]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[02:43:51.462 --> 02:43:55.368]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.

[02:44:03.602 --> 02:44:11.208]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[02:44:11.208 --> 02:44:13.430]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:21.233]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWareStore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.

[02:44:56.816 --> 02:44:57.477]  Please take action.
[02:44:58.195 --> 02:45:05.138]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:45:05.138 --> 02:45:14.123]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:45:14.123 --> 02:45:16.324]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:45:16.944 --> 02:45:20.265]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:45:20.265 --> 02:45:28.767]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:45:28.767 --> 02:45:33.608]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:45:33.608 --> 02:45:44.551]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:45:45.111 --> 02:45:47.152]  Pure nascent iodine.
[02:45:47.152 --> 02:45:51.174]  Stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:54.315]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.

[02:46:02.239 --> 02:46:11.063]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, read about the ingredients, look them up for yourself, and then understand this is cold-pressed herbs, so it has a more powerful effect to the body.

[02:46:16.047 --> 02:46:18.069]  Super Mel Vitality is selling out.
[02:46:18.069 --> 02:46:20.911]  It's an incredible formula for stamina, energy, libido.
[02:46:20.911 --> 02:46:22.232]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[02:46:22.232 --> 02:46:27.616]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[02:46:27.616 --> 02:46:28.396]  It boosts men.
[02:46:28.396 --> 02:46:29.417]  It boosts women.
[02:46:29.417 --> 02:46:30.198]  It works great.
[02:46:30.198 --> 02:46:32.059]  But women like pink labels.
[02:46:32.059 --> 02:46:34.041]  Men like different color labels.
[02:46:34.041 --> 02:46:36.062]  So it works for men as well.
[02:46:36.062 --> 02:46:37.123]  It's the same formula.
[02:46:37.123 --> 02:46:38.384]  It's an incredible formula.
[02:46:38.384 --> 02:46:39.345]  And it funds our operation.
[02:46:39.345 --> 02:46:41.046]  And there's another important part of the

[02:46:42.687 --> 02:46:45.289]  It's 50% off for a limited time.

[02:46:59.458 --> 02:47:05.362]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.395 --> 02:47:20.296]  You can see it!
[02:47:20.296 --> 02:47:24.698]  You don't have a choice.
[02:47:24.698 --> 02:47:28.559]  You're not looking for the five, folks.
[02:47:28.559 --> 02:47:30.780]  You didn't start it.
[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:36.122]  You're not getting out of this without a major fight.
[02:47:36.122 --> 02:47:37.722]  Go ahead.
[02:47:37.722 --> 02:47:39.923]  Turn it loose.
[02:47:39.923 --> 02:47:41.484]  Open it up.
[02:47:41.484 --> 02:47:43.104]  Give them what they want.
[02:47:43.104 --> 02:47:44.205]  Give them what they came looking for.
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:51.860]  All right, let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:53.621]  He's got a theory on Trump's indictment.
[02:47:53.621 --> 02:47:55.621]  Give us your take, Carlos.
[02:47:55.621 --> 02:47:56.901]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:56.901 --> 02:48:08.083]  You remember during the Clinton-Trump debate when Hillary Clinton said, it's a good thing that you don't control the judicial system?
[02:48:08.083 --> 02:48:11.124]  And he said, yeah, because I put you in jail about it.
[02:48:11.124 --> 02:48:16.065]  Yeah, well, it has her fingerprints all over this persecution.
[02:48:16.684 --> 02:48:19.485]  is to show him that she can put him in jail.
[02:48:19.485 --> 02:48:20.125]  That's number one.
[02:48:20.125 --> 02:48:25.528]  Number two, she needs him to be in jail, because she cannot run against him and win.
[02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:27.108]  That would be something else.
[02:48:27.108 --> 02:48:31.730]  Especially if by then, perchance, she should be a widow.
[02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:36.632]  Why do you think Trump said a few days ago, sarcastically, oh, I love Hillary now.
[02:48:36.632 --> 02:48:37.633]  My problem is Biden.
[02:48:37.633 --> 02:48:38.193]  What was that about?
[02:48:39.508 --> 02:48:42.870]  Well, he can believe whatever he wants to believe.
[02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:43.790]  I don't know.
[02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:53.334]  But certainly, she certainly was told by Lynne Forrester de Rothschild shortly after she lost the election that she would be president one day.
[02:48:53.334 --> 02:48:58.517]  And she had all the backing of the Rothschild family, of Lynne Rothschild and so on at that time.
[02:48:58.517 --> 02:49:01.258]  And the fundraising was a limited amount.
[02:49:01.258 --> 02:49:03.059]  So that promise is still there.
[02:49:03.059 --> 02:49:06.260]  She promised that perhaps within 90 days, he'd be out of office.
[02:49:07.173 --> 02:49:10.376]  Well, I remember they had CIA guys saying it'll be gone in a few months.
[02:49:10.376 --> 02:49:11.897]  That's why they're so panicked.
[02:49:11.897 --> 02:49:15.580]  That's why they've had to, like, totally... Trump did this.
[02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:19.003]  He made the deep state show its butt.
[02:49:19.003 --> 02:49:20.605]  He made them come right out in the open.
[02:49:20.605 --> 02:49:24.749]  And they don't get how they're like a vampire hauled out in the middle of high noon.
[02:49:24.749 --> 02:49:25.849]  They don't get that.
[02:49:25.849 --> 02:49:26.590]  Forget Trump.
[02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:27.491]  They're done now.
[02:49:27.491 --> 02:49:28.512]  They've destroyed themselves.
[02:49:29.369 --> 02:49:31.050]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:54.342]  There is a tendency, and also in a future program, we'll talk about this, if you may, John F. Kennedy's death and assassination wasn't a total failure of his policy, because after 60 years, he demonstrated a secret power, a great, great power, that could have the President of the United States killed in the middle of the day in front of everybody on a convertible.
[02:49:54.913 --> 02:49:59.535]  And that power is what I call the hidden monarch.
[02:49:59.535 --> 02:50:03.277]  Someone had to have the nod to go ahead.
[02:50:03.277 --> 02:50:08.000]  All the other agencies, all the people that wanted him killed, none of them had the capability.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.561]  They're all a bunch of yes-men, so who gave the order?
[02:50:10.561 --> 02:50:13.803]  In fact, because of course they had the mafia there and the army there.
[02:50:14.703 --> 02:50:18.885]  I'll tell you in a final, in another time when we have the opportunity to discuss, John F. Kennedy assassination.
[02:50:44.755 --> 02:50:48.316]  The order was given by a monarchical power.
[02:50:48.316 --> 02:50:52.798]  It would have been someone who was told the president has to go.
[02:50:52.798 --> 02:50:54.139]  Well, do you have it all set up?
[02:50:54.139 --> 02:50:55.059]  Can it be done?
[02:50:55.059 --> 02:50:55.459]  Yes.
[02:50:55.459 --> 02:50:58.781]  And then lowering of the eyes and a nod of the head.
[02:50:58.781 --> 02:51:03.322]  Once that happens, everybody else mobilized to cover up, to clean it up.
[02:51:03.322 --> 02:51:07.304]  But if you look at very, very, very carefully at December 20th, 1963,
[02:51:10.046 --> 02:51:18.912]  Almost a month after, on the front cover of Time Magazine, which was owned, of course, by, you know, people that belong to Skull and Bones, okay?
[02:51:18.912 --> 02:51:21.074]  The Luce family, and so on.
[02:51:21.074 --> 02:51:28.859]  This picture was the signal to go ahead and pay $200,000 to all the participants that took place.
[02:51:28.859 --> 02:51:32.842]  And so, instead of going through the weeds at the top, let's go from the top to the bottom.
[02:51:32.842 --> 02:51:39.126]  Check the December 20th, 1963 front cover of Time Magazine, and the nod was given
[02:51:39.517 --> 02:51:43.241]  Okay, I'll look up that date, but tell us who you think was in charge there.
[02:51:43.241 --> 02:51:43.481]  Oh, of course.
[02:52:02.003 --> 02:52:12.971]  The most powerful, richest man in the world, and there was an article written, I believe by a gentleman called Hoffman, on the very title, The Richest Man in the World, I think that was called, yes.
[02:52:12.971 --> 02:52:15.813]  Alright, thank you Carlos, always interesting.
[02:52:15.813 --> 02:52:18.395]  Let's go to Vic in Tennessee, then Sadex, Daryl, and Joey.
[02:52:18.395 --> 02:52:20.776]  Go ahead, Vic.
[02:52:20.776 --> 02:52:22.378]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:52:22.378 --> 02:52:28.982]  First off, I love your down and out, I sleep like a baby, and I wake up ready to take on the world.
[02:52:28.982 --> 02:52:29.302]  Thank you.
[02:52:31.328 --> 02:52:37.691]  I believe the feds incited the riot on January 6th and this is why and I want to get your take on it.
[02:52:37.691 --> 02:52:47.635]  Imagine an inauguration day with 50,000 Biden supporters and 500,000 Trump supporters or a million MAGA folks on the streets of DC.
[02:52:47.635 --> 02:52:51.217]  They needed a virtual inauguration.
[02:52:51.217 --> 02:52:55.419]  They needed a reason to use the military to lock down DC.
[02:52:58.627 --> 02:52:59.888]  I think those are optics.
[02:52:59.888 --> 02:53:02.571]  Yeah, I think even the complicit lapdog media couldn't hide those kind of optics.
[02:53:02.571 --> 02:53:03.172]  Social media giants.
[02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:26.794]  With their proven ties to the captured intel community and all the three-letter agencies, they couldn't overcome those kind of optics.
[02:53:26.794 --> 02:53:31.817]  And even if they had failed to incite violence that day, they still had the pipe bombers.
[02:53:31.817 --> 02:53:34.118]  You know, the pipe bombers that they never looked for.
[02:53:34.118 --> 02:53:34.679]  That's exactly.
[02:53:34.679 --> 02:53:38.401]  If they couldn't have broken into the Capitol, they ran a detonated pipe bomb.
[02:53:38.401 --> 02:53:40.962]  Right when Trump pulled up.
[02:53:40.962 --> 02:53:42.903]  Yeah, they never even looked for those folks.
[02:53:42.903 --> 02:53:46.285]  And I think even if that had failed, they just still just used COVID
[02:53:47.048 --> 02:53:56.918]  They'd lock down the city, use the military, and they'd put up their little flags and said, these flags represent our supporters who just couldn't be here this day.
[02:53:56.918 --> 02:54:00.421]  I think what you're saying is 100% true.
[02:54:00.421 --> 02:54:01.582]  That's what they did.
[02:54:01.582 --> 02:54:02.483]  So what do they do now?
[02:54:02.483 --> 02:54:04.185]  I mean, they're really biting off a lot.
[02:54:04.185 --> 02:54:09.129]  What do you think their plan is to be able to indict Trump, have a show trial in D.C.?
[02:54:09.129 --> 02:54:11.552]  I mean, that is going to be really hard to pull off.
[02:54:12.577 --> 02:54:14.559]  You know, they've already gone so far.
[02:54:14.559 --> 02:54:18.583]  I never imagined that we could fall this low.
[02:54:18.583 --> 02:54:22.427]  I'm really disappointed, but I don't know.
[02:54:22.427 --> 02:54:27.052]  I don't think there's anything they're not willing to do at this point.
[02:54:28.275 --> 02:54:28.655]  I agree.
[02:54:28.655 --> 02:54:30.556]  I think war with Russia is already happening.
[02:54:30.556 --> 02:54:34.277]  I think they'll set off... I think they're going to attack the power grid and say, we did it.
[02:54:34.277 --> 02:54:36.298]  I mean, they're already saying that's going to happen.
[02:54:36.298 --> 02:54:44.161]  Imagine the FBI a month and a half ago put out a memo, we believe the main threat is right-wingers with Russia are going to turn the power off.
[02:54:44.161 --> 02:54:46.282]  The Democrats are the ones cutting the power off.
[02:54:46.282 --> 02:54:48.763]  I mean, that is so ridiculous.
[02:54:48.763 --> 02:54:50.904]  Yeah, they've always got their invisible boogeyman.
[02:54:55.051 --> 02:54:56.433]  Well, they're definitely crazy as hell.
[02:54:56.433 --> 02:54:57.554]  What do you make of Biden?
[02:54:57.554 --> 02:54:59.717]  I mean, he doesn't even know who he is now.
[02:54:59.717 --> 02:55:00.478]  Oh, he's a puppet.
[02:55:00.478 --> 02:55:02.881]  He's just a puppet.
[02:55:02.881 --> 02:55:04.263]  He's a feckless old fool.
[02:55:04.263 --> 02:55:05.705]  He's the perfect Democrat.
[02:55:09.212 --> 02:55:10.353]  Well, I gotta say this.
[02:55:10.353 --> 02:55:12.514]  Trump's not perfect, but man, I gotta support him.
[02:55:12.514 --> 02:55:13.435]  He's definitely real.
[02:55:13.435 --> 02:55:14.075]  I mean, he is.
[02:55:14.075 --> 02:55:14.876]  He is.
[02:55:14.876 --> 02:55:15.796]  And I'm proud of him.
[02:55:15.796 --> 02:55:18.678]  Charged up, going in, not afraid.
[02:55:18.678 --> 02:55:23.261]  He's like really an example of manly will.
[02:55:23.261 --> 02:55:24.582]  I mean, let's just say it.
[02:55:24.582 --> 02:55:26.063]  Trump's really amazing.
[02:55:26.063 --> 02:55:31.767]  At almost 80 years old, that guy is something else, man.
[02:55:31.767 --> 02:55:32.928]  What do you think about Trump, Vic?
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:40.185]  I didn't support him in 2016 because I didn't believe he could do what he said he was going to do.
[02:55:40.185 --> 02:55:49.111]  And I didn't, of course, support Hillary Clinton because I believed she'd do everything she said she was going to do.
[02:55:49.111 --> 02:55:56.176]  So I retreated into my party and I voted Libertarian, even though I didn't really agree with Gary Johnson on much of anything.
[02:55:58.317 --> 02:56:00.558]  And I had to eat a lot of crow in the year after that.
[02:56:00.558 --> 02:56:05.781]  I had to call up those people who told me Trump was the real deal and tell them, hey man, you were right.
[02:56:05.781 --> 02:56:09.563]  You know, everything I feared about Trump hasn't come to fruition.
[02:56:09.563 --> 02:56:15.946]  And everything that I was hopeful he would do, he's at least trying to get done.
[02:56:15.946 --> 02:56:23.690]  And I tell you what, you have got to treat a man pretty freaking bad to get me to feel sorry for a billionaire.
[02:56:23.690 --> 02:56:24.671]  I just don't do that.
[02:56:26.184 --> 02:56:27.604]  Oh, it's insane.
[02:56:27.604 --> 02:56:31.286]  And look, I think there's a good chance they're going to kill him and RFK Jr.
[02:56:31.286 --> 02:56:33.026]  And you say that's so over the top.
[02:56:33.026 --> 02:56:36.847]  These people are over the top because they've never faced defeat.
[02:56:36.847 --> 02:56:38.728]  And I can tell you, this is their defeat.
[02:56:38.728 --> 02:56:39.428]  Here's the good news.
[02:56:39.428 --> 02:56:41.649]  Whether they kill Trump or not, they're done.
[02:56:41.649 --> 02:56:44.310]  The only question is, will they drag us with them in a nuclear war?
[02:56:44.310 --> 02:56:47.391]  And I've got to tell you, good chance we're all dead.
[02:56:47.391 --> 02:56:51.412]  But I think the Southern Hemisphere will rebuild things and we'll come back in a few thousand years.
[02:56:52.392 --> 02:56:53.233]  All right, thank you, Vic.
[02:56:53.233 --> 02:56:55.754]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back, start the next hour.
[02:56:55.754 --> 02:57:00.937]  Savicks, Jody, and Daryl, and then I'm going to let the guest hosts take over.
[02:57:00.937 --> 02:57:04.059]  Don't forget, it supports the broadcast, plus it's not going to last long.

[02:57:24.791 --> 02:57:27.713]  And we're going to keep that at 30% off until it sells out.
[02:57:27.713 --> 02:57:29.534]  I bet it sells out in like a week.
[02:57:29.534 --> 02:57:35.438]  But the big thing is, up to 60% off to all Patriot points as part of the Patriot Pride Month that runs through July.

[02:57:47.540 --> 02:57:53.901]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:57:53.901 --> 02:58:00.322]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:58:00.322 --> 02:58:03.683]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[02:58:03.683 --> 02:58:12.845]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:58:12.845 --> 02:58:13.305]  Look it up.
[02:58:13.925 --> 02:58:15.306]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:58:15.306 --> 02:58:18.508]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:58:18.508 --> 02:58:21.651]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.

[02:58:28.195 --> 02:58:29.196]  It is amazing.

[02:58:34.039 --> 02:58:35.460]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[02:58:35.460 --> 02:58:39.223]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[02:58:44.589 --> 02:58:45.890]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:58:45.890 --> 02:58:46.551]  You need this filter.
[02:58:58.223 --> 02:59:01.744]  Don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[02:59:01.744 --> 02:59:05.645]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[02:59:05.645 --> 02:59:13.127]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[02:59:13.127 --> 02:59:19.949]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship,

[02:59:50.891 --> 02:59:55.633]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:55.633 --> 03:00:05.298]  People wonder how Trump or R.F.K.
[03:00:05.298 --> 03:00:06.538]  Jeter could be ready to die.
[03:00:06.538 --> 03:00:14.061]  I think a lot of you have the idea, but I'm going to explain it to those who don't understand it at the start of the next segment.
[03:00:14.061 --> 03:00:16.443]  Because I've been down the same road.
[03:00:16.443 --> 03:00:18.323]  And there are things worse than death.
[03:00:18.323 --> 03:00:19.304]  I'll explain it when we come back.
[03:00:20.232 --> 03:00:23.675]  Let's go ahead and go to Savicks in Seattle.
[03:00:23.675 --> 03:00:24.516]  You're on the air.
[03:00:24.516 --> 03:00:26.618]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[03:00:26.618 --> 03:00:28.539]  Yes, Alex.
[03:00:28.539 --> 03:00:41.390]  President Trump, Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, everybody else, beware of the deepfake AI, deep state God, which I believe is going to be, they're going to ramp up that.
[03:00:41.390 --> 03:00:47.375]  They're going to start accelerating the deepfakes with what happened to Gregg Reese's voice.
[03:00:47.375 --> 03:00:48.196]  They do his voice.
[03:00:48.837 --> 03:00:49.457]  I agree.
[03:00:49.457 --> 03:00:51.078]  They've already done it with Tucker Carlson and me.
[03:00:51.078 --> 03:00:58.503]  And I've talked about some of the behind the scenes stuff where people have been spoofing my voice and calling family and things like that.
[03:00:58.503 --> 03:01:00.665]  So it's definitely going on.
[03:01:17.662 --> 03:01:21.005]  Yeah, I believe that's what they're going to do before the election.
[03:01:21.005 --> 03:01:27.812]  They're going to start creating these deepfakes, either video or voice or something, to create confusion.
[03:01:27.812 --> 03:01:30.094]  Is he really saying that?
[03:01:30.094 --> 03:01:31.996]  And then get us all distracted.
[03:01:31.996 --> 03:01:38.323]  No, I agree, but at the end of the day, doesn't it show the establishment's losing?
[03:01:38.323 --> 03:01:40.405]  Yes, it is losing, and we're winning.
[03:01:40.405 --> 03:01:41.626]  We're growing by the minute.
[03:01:42.638 --> 03:01:51.123]  And that's the next step I think they're going to do before they try to kill anybody, any of us that are on the Freedom Movement.
[03:01:51.123 --> 03:01:55.986]  So I think they're going to accelerate the deepfakes all over the place.
[03:01:55.986 --> 03:01:57.387]  That's my opinion.
[03:01:57.387 --> 03:01:57.947]  I agree with you.
[03:01:57.947 --> 03:02:00.909]  What else do you think is going to happen, Savick?
[03:02:00.909 --> 03:02:04.371]  Well, I believe that they're going to keep pushing the
[03:02:07.975 --> 03:02:20.859]  The LGBT agenda, the acceptance of pedophilia in our states, like right here, Washington State, with the public schools, we know that they're already doing it.
[03:02:20.859 --> 03:02:27.001]  If you want to go get surgery, if you're in middle school, go ahead, and without a parent's consent.
[03:02:27.001 --> 03:02:32.183]  So they're going to accelerate everything else as much as they can, as much garbage as they can.
[03:02:32.183 --> 03:02:37.405]  That's right, and when parents opt out of it, even if they find out about it, they get socially penalized for opting out of it.
[03:02:39.045 --> 03:02:39.786]  That's right, yep.
[03:02:39.786 --> 03:02:46.210]  I believe they're going to accelerate everything else before the election, so it's a cluster mess.
[03:02:46.210 --> 03:02:47.091]  I agree.
[03:02:47.091 --> 03:02:49.892]  Anybody saying we live in boring times is crazy.
[03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:53.455]  I mean, Savick, is this not a crazy time to be alive?
[03:02:53.455 --> 03:03:02.281]  It is crazy, amazing, and we're living in the prophecies that our ancestors
[03:03:03.306 --> 03:03:04.066]  I don't know.
[03:03:26.062 --> 03:03:29.384]  And so, we are going to get front row seats.
[03:03:29.384 --> 03:03:35.747]  We'll go to break, come back with Daryl, thank you Sadik, and Joey, then I'm going to hand the baton to our special guest host.
[03:03:35.747 --> 03:03:37.328]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but...
[03:03:38.604 --> 03:03:41.805]  I mean, I really was thinking about why is RFK Jr.
[03:03:41.805 --> 03:03:42.445]  willing to die?
[03:03:42.445 --> 03:03:44.345]  Why is Trump willing to die?
[03:03:44.345 --> 03:03:50.347]  And why Trump, particularly in the face of all these threats, and in prison and death, why is he so confident?
[03:03:50.347 --> 03:03:52.627]  And it's the same reason Robert F. Kennedy's confident.
[03:03:52.627 --> 03:03:54.488]  He was there when his dad was gunned down and murdered.
[03:03:54.488 --> 03:03:57.788]  He was there when his dad died, holding his hand.
[03:03:57.788 --> 03:04:02.689]  Before that, he watched his uncle murdered on television, the president.
[03:04:02.689 --> 03:04:04.610]  And you just realize there are things worse than death.
[03:04:05.575 --> 03:04:07.617]  Just realize, like, I'm not gonna bow down.
[03:04:07.617 --> 03:04:08.978]  I'm not gonna be these people's slave.
[03:04:08.978 --> 03:04:14.043]  I have to stand against them.
[03:04:14.043 --> 03:04:17.547]  And I have to call them out on the fact that they want to intimidate me.
[03:04:17.547 --> 03:04:18.548]  And just let them know that...
[03:04:20.134 --> 03:04:21.996]  In the end, they're going to go down.
[03:04:21.996 --> 03:04:23.697]  And they will go down.
[03:04:23.697 --> 03:04:27.360]  This country's been hijacked by covert intelligence agencies since the end of World War II.
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:30.622]  British intelligence basically involved running it.
[03:04:30.622 --> 03:04:32.984]  I'm not blaming the British, but it's that model.
[03:04:32.984 --> 03:04:36.567]  And they've run the country in the ground and they've got to be stopped.
[03:04:36.567 --> 03:04:39.810]  And a lot of us won't make it in the fight, but in the end, these guys will be removed.
[03:04:40.612 --> 03:04:41.553]  They will be dealt with.
[03:04:41.553 --> 03:04:43.174]  They will be crushed.
[03:04:43.174 --> 03:04:47.858]  Back in 60 seconds for two final calls as Maria Zee from Australia takes over.
[03:04:47.858 --> 03:04:50.180]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:52.382]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:57.455 --> 03:05:02.257]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:05:02.257 --> 03:05:04.818]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:05:04.818 --> 03:05:06.299]  So let me get this straight.
[03:05:06.299 --> 03:05:25.747]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter, to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia,
[03:05:26.047 --> 03:05:52.364]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:05:52.364 --> 03:05:53.565]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:23.903]  Why would President Trump, why would Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who both know the deep state, the corrupt, entitled bureaucracy is gunning for, they're trying to put him in prison, trying to kill him, trying to destroy him, still have the courage to fight?
[03:06:23.903 --> 03:06:27.044]  Because submitting to these tyrants is worse than death.
[03:06:27.044 --> 03:06:31.945]  It's turning your soul and your will over to these horrible people.
[03:06:32.836 --> 03:06:41.123]  That are carrying out these incredibly destructive agendas against the children, against the women, against the men, against culture and society.
[03:06:41.123 --> 03:06:53.832]  It is a genetic, spiritual will to build something better and to not be slaves that demands, that commands, that compels us to do the right thing.
[03:06:53.832 --> 03:06:56.374]  And that's why I don't fear death.
[03:06:56.374 --> 03:06:57.415]  I don't fear prison.
[03:06:57.415 --> 03:06:57.916]  I don't fear
[03:06:59.335 --> 03:07:00.315]  Being destroyed.
[03:07:00.315 --> 03:07:03.937]  I certainly want to keep working and keep fighting and spending time with my family.
[03:07:03.937 --> 03:07:06.318]  But at the end of the day, I know I can't ever stop.
[03:07:06.318 --> 03:07:10.360]  There's not even 1% of me that wants to give up or give in.
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:12.241]  Because I understand the larger mission.
[03:07:12.241 --> 03:07:15.163]  Now I get frustrated by prosecuting the war against the globals.
[03:07:15.163 --> 03:07:18.564]  And I get frustrated by my own weakness and other people's weakness around me.
[03:07:18.564 --> 03:07:21.986]  But at the end of the day, there's no discussion of quitting out of fear.
[03:07:23.311 --> 03:07:27.335]  Sometimes you're like, well, I've kind of run my course and already put in my fight.
[03:07:27.335 --> 03:07:29.718]  And so it's now up to others to finish the fight.
[03:07:29.718 --> 03:07:34.763]  But it's like the movie The Patriot, based on a composite, two stories after his son dies, his second son dies.
[03:07:34.763 --> 03:07:37.426]  And he's been to the war for five, six years.
[03:07:37.426 --> 03:07:39.748]  And he just says, it's up to other people now.
[03:07:39.748 --> 03:07:40.789]  I'm going to go home and just...
[03:07:41.673 --> 03:07:47.655]  And then he sees the flag that his son had carried, and remembers what he did, his dedication.
[03:07:47.655 --> 03:07:50.756]  He says, too many people have died for this.
[03:07:50.756 --> 03:07:59.120]  Too many people have struggled and everything they built, taken from them for us to then act like half measures are the only way.
[03:07:59.120 --> 03:08:01.921]  No, it's because our enemy is so bad they've got to be beaten.
[03:08:01.921 --> 03:08:08.963]  It's because they are so evil and sick that we've got to go all the way and never give up and put our full energy against them.
[03:08:08.963 --> 03:08:10.424]  That's what God's looking for.
[03:08:11.124 --> 03:08:13.205]  Total commitment!
[03:08:13.205 --> 03:08:16.907]  And only total commitment will beat these people.
[03:08:16.907 --> 03:08:18.668]  And they will be beaten.
[03:08:18.668 --> 03:08:20.849]  But we don't beat them to prove we're better than them.
[03:08:20.849 --> 03:08:22.010]  We know they're better than them.
[03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:27.913]  We beat them because the children are counting on us to build a real future world for them.
[03:08:27.913 --> 03:08:38.179]  And just as we stand on the shoulders of the men and women that came before us and sacrificed everything, we're going to do that now in this fight and complete that circle into the future.
[03:08:39.185 --> 03:08:42.807]  Alright, Joey in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[03:08:42.807 --> 03:08:53.751]  Hey, I completely agree with you that evil has no power, because evil has already been destroyed by my father.
[03:08:53.751 --> 03:09:03.415]  He sent the son, Jesus Christ, to destroy sin and to destroy death, and people are still sinning, and people are still dead.
[03:09:04.420 --> 03:09:18.626]  So I'm here to tell you that all of this would not be happening if people simply died with me, as I did on the cross, and my Father in Heaven would resurrect you with me into eternal life.
[03:09:18.626 --> 03:09:24.188]  So are you speaking second or third person as Christ, or are you saying you are Christ?
[03:09:24.188 --> 03:09:26.509]  If you knew me, you would abide in my love?
[03:09:26.509 --> 03:09:27.550]  Joey, I appreciate your call.
[03:09:28.186 --> 03:09:30.228]  I appreciate it.
[03:09:30.228 --> 03:09:30.989]  I believe in Christ.
[03:09:30.989 --> 03:09:33.010]  I believe what you're saying, but you're not Christ.
[03:09:33.010 --> 03:09:34.972]  Let's talk to Daryl in North Carolina.
[03:09:34.972 --> 03:09:35.513]  You're on the air.
[03:09:35.513 --> 03:09:37.494]  Welcome.
[03:09:37.494 --> 03:09:38.695]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:09:38.695 --> 03:09:39.536]  Wow.
[03:09:39.536 --> 03:09:41.017]  For the last caller.
[03:09:41.017 --> 03:09:48.704]  I want to talk about the Trump indictment and some potential offensive game plans that we can take.
[03:09:48.704 --> 03:09:52.908]  Not only Trump, but others who are being persecuted by this D.C.
[03:09:52.908 --> 03:09:53.148]  court.
[03:09:53.841 --> 03:10:04.847]  So my question is this, if the courts are criminal and evil, and you know that, and you're going to go get sentenced, do you martyr yourself and just take the sentence?
[03:10:04.847 --> 03:10:12.331]  Or do you maybe become a fugitive, thus maybe becoming an American hero or a folk legend?
[03:10:12.331 --> 03:10:16.574]  Now, you know, I might want to do that, man.
[03:10:16.574 --> 03:10:18.595]  I could go hang out in the Appalachian Mountains
[03:10:19.022 --> 03:10:20.123]  I mean, I hear you.
[03:10:20.123 --> 03:10:25.186]  I mean, in the past, if Trump ran off to some undisclosed location, they'd say, oh, he's a coward.
[03:10:25.186 --> 03:10:27.708]  No, I mean, this system is so discredited, who knows?
[03:10:27.708 --> 03:10:29.429]  I mean, I hear what you're saying.
[03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:30.250]  It's definitely crazy times.
[03:10:44.042 --> 03:11:01.807]  Yeah, like, you know, if non-compliance is the answer, then not complying with the criminal kangaroo court seems to be the next logical step for an American that's being... Well, I think the way to do it is what Congress is talking about, impeaching the Attorney General and these judges.
[03:11:01.807 --> 03:11:02.968]  Yes, if they can do it.
[03:11:02.968 --> 03:11:06.549]  But, I mean, do you see McCarthy today when he's asked about the Trump indictment?
[03:11:06.549 --> 03:11:07.329]  Total jello.
[03:11:07.754 --> 03:11:08.775]  I mean, nothing.
[03:11:08.775 --> 03:11:15.500]  I don't think any of these politicians are going to do anything except jockey for a position in the new world order.
[03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:16.121]  No, I hear you.
[03:11:16.121 --> 03:11:17.042]  That's why they were chosen.
[03:11:17.042 --> 03:11:19.203]  I didn't see what McCarthy said.
[03:11:19.203 --> 03:11:21.505]  What happened?
[03:11:21.505 --> 03:11:25.448]  He gave a quick 30 second spiel on, you know, what do you think about the Trump endowment?
[03:11:25.448 --> 03:11:27.630]  Oh, well, gosh, they sure shouldn't be doing that.
[03:11:27.630 --> 03:11:29.472]  And I'm real mad about that.
[03:11:29.472 --> 03:11:31.313]  You know, this is not right.
[03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:33.735]  Just the same old finalists.
[03:11:33.735 --> 03:11:35.076]  There's nothing there.
[03:11:35.076 --> 03:11:36.037]  It's like they're all just
[03:11:36.587 --> 03:11:38.568]  They're playing us for fools.
[03:11:38.568 --> 03:11:40.148]  And we need to go on the offensive.
[03:11:40.148 --> 03:11:43.569]  And all I'm saying is, is it time for an American, another Tea Party?
[03:11:43.569 --> 03:11:45.330]  You know, and all we do is just say, you know what?
[03:11:45.330 --> 03:11:52.012]  I'm not going to comply with, with your, you know, if you get sentenced, if they say, hey, we're going to put you in for five years.
[03:11:52.012 --> 03:11:53.192]  Why?
[03:11:53.192 --> 03:11:54.293]  Why comply with that?
[03:11:54.293 --> 03:11:55.553]  Unless you want to be a martyr.
[03:11:55.553 --> 03:11:56.453]  And that's the way to do it.
[03:11:56.453 --> 03:11:57.854]  Hey, be a martyr.
[03:11:57.854 --> 03:11:58.534]  Or don't.
[03:11:59.212 --> 03:12:00.013]  Do something else.
[03:12:00.013 --> 03:12:01.254]  I'm just coming up with an idea.
[03:12:01.254 --> 03:12:02.055]  And I would help out.
[03:12:02.055 --> 03:12:02.955]  Because you know what?
[03:12:02.955 --> 03:12:06.939]  If you harbor a fugitive, I think you get a bigger sentence than the fugitive.
[03:12:06.939 --> 03:12:09.301]  So actually, the one harboring is really sticking out.
[03:12:09.301 --> 03:12:13.025]  Yeah, but I don't think Trump can go to Saudi Arabia or something.
[03:12:13.025 --> 03:12:16.308]  Russia's already inviting him over there, but the office wouldn't be right on that.
[03:12:16.308 --> 03:12:17.609]  All right, Darrell, I hear your point.
[03:12:17.609 --> 03:12:18.489]  I really appreciate you.
[03:12:19.310 --> 03:12:22.092]  All right, Maria Z, great talk show host out of Australia.
[03:12:22.092 --> 03:12:25.274]  Zmedia, z-e-e-e-media.com.
[03:12:25.274 --> 03:12:26.574]  She's been fighting the tyranny over there.
[03:12:26.574 --> 03:12:27.995]  They're planning more lockdowns here.
[03:12:27.995 --> 03:12:30.196]  It's the same globalist army we're facing.
[03:12:30.196 --> 03:12:31.157]  Look forward to her insight.
[03:12:31.157 --> 03:12:32.198]  Maria Z, thanks for being here.
[03:12:32.198 --> 03:12:32.578]  Take over.
[03:12:33.902 --> 03:12:35.463]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:12:35.463 --> 03:12:40.245]  We are all so, so grateful for all of your years of service and waking up the world.
[03:12:40.245 --> 03:12:45.867]  It is because of Alex Jones and InfoWars that so many people are waking up to the truth.
[03:12:45.867 --> 03:12:55.531]  And we have made so much progress, so much progress in people realising, you know, just the other day Alex was talking about a real life vampire.
[03:12:55.531 --> 03:12:58.992]  Back maybe 10 years ago, some people would have thought that's crazy.
[03:12:59.552 --> 03:13:04.433]  Ten years on, a lot of people are saying, yeah, wow, this stuff really does exist.
[03:13:04.433 --> 03:13:14.175]  And so the topic that we're going to be covering today with my special guest is no less crazy than all of the other things that have come out to be true.
[03:13:14.175 --> 03:13:21.496]  She's one of the most comprehensive researchers that I know on the topics of synthetic biology, transhumanism, the AI takeover.
[03:13:21.496 --> 03:13:25.437]  And the last time that we had Celeste Solem here on this broadcast with us,
[03:13:25.897 --> 03:13:31.542]  She talked to us about the hidden tech out there ready to manipulate human beings and hack the soul.
[03:13:31.542 --> 03:13:35.345]  She joins us today with more breaking news on the transhumanism front.
[03:13:35.345 --> 03:13:38.087]  Celeste Solem from CelestialReport.com.
[03:13:38.087 --> 03:13:39.848]  Welcome.
[03:13:39.848 --> 03:13:42.450]  It's great to be here, Maria.
[03:13:42.450 --> 03:13:43.991]  It's so good to see you again.
[03:13:43.991 --> 03:13:47.674]  Well, give us a brief outline of what you're going to be covering today.
[03:13:47.674 --> 03:13:51.557]  I know the news is hot, hot, hot off the press.
[03:13:51.557 --> 03:13:52.598]  It is, it is.
[03:13:52.598 --> 03:13:53.839]  So when I did
[03:13:54.281 --> 03:14:08.873]  The synthetic biology webinar, what I discovered was that there was a link between synthetic biology, Marxism and the LGBT movement.
[03:14:08.873 --> 03:14:12.516]  And we think that it just kind of all sprang up at one time.
[03:14:12.516 --> 03:14:13.797]  It didn't.
[03:14:13.797 --> 03:14:17.661]  This has been very well planned out really since Darwin.
[03:14:18.341 --> 03:14:35.335]  But what we're going to talk about today, and I do have some notes to keep me on track Because I do do deep dives and we can't do that today So I'm just gonna be giving you all a brief overview of some of the things that I discovered as I was going down the rabbit hole and
[03:14:35.755 --> 03:14:51.742]  But we have to realize that this is just one component, even though we're talking about synthetic biology, Marxism, and the LGBT community, it is only one component in an integrated weapon system.
[03:14:51.742 --> 03:14:55.864]  You need to realize that this is a weapon system.
[03:14:55.864 --> 03:14:59.546]  So that's what we're going to be talking about today.
[03:14:59.546 --> 03:15:02.727]  Well, I absolutely agree with you and I've said
[03:15:03.377 --> 03:15:10.329]  On many broadcasts, especially of late Celeste, that the technology that these people have is so much further advanced.
[03:15:10.771 --> 03:15:39.889]  I just interviewed a researcher couple from Morocco, Hope and Tavon, they're scientists and researchers, former government employees as well, and they've been looking a lot into synthetic biology, the links between 5G, 6G, 7G, what the capabilities are of this technology in terms of controlling the human being, the technology that's in the injections, the technology that's in the upcoming injections, so the little needleless
[03:15:40.329 --> 03:15:44.115]  Vaccine patches that we're creating here in Australia.
[03:15:44.115 --> 03:15:47.420]  400 million of them for a population of 25 million a year.
[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:48.842]  Very, very interesting.
[03:15:48.842 --> 03:15:51.827]  So right after this short break, we're going to dive in with Celeste.
[03:15:51.827 --> 03:15:52.648]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:52.648 --> 03:15:54.211]  This is groundbreaking information.
[03:15:56.926 --> 03:16:03.576]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:16:03.576 --> 03:16:05.499]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:16:05.499 --> 03:16:07.021]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:16:07.021 --> 03:16:09.805]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:16:09.805 --> 03:16:11.828]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:16:12.589 --> 03:16:14.570]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:16:14.570 --> 03:16:17.011]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:16:17.011 --> 03:16:19.151]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:16:19.151 --> 03:16:24.533]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:16:24.533 --> 03:16:25.734]  Jail background.
[03:16:25.734 --> 03:16:26.774]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:16:26.774 --> 03:16:30.916]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:16:30.916 --> 03:16:32.516]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:16:32.516 --> 03:16:33.536]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:16:33.536 --> 03:16:36.077]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:16:36.077 --> 03:16:36.858]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:16:36.858 --> 03:16:37.738]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:16:38.238 --> 03:16:39.439]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:16:58.993 --> 03:17:02.976]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:17:02.976 --> 03:17:06.178]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:17:06.178 --> 03:17:13.903]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:17:14.403 --> 03:17:17.985]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:17:17.985 --> 03:17:20.206]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:17:20.206 --> 03:17:22.907]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[03:17:22.907 --> 03:17:27.490]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:17:27.490 --> 03:17:29.491]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:17:29.491 --> 03:17:31.652]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:17:31.652 --> 03:17:34.434]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[03:17:34.434 --> 03:17:39.536]  Exclusively at InfowarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.

[03:17:46.042 --> 03:17:53.051]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:17:53.051 --> 03:17:55.514]  In some cases they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:17:56.479 --> 03:17:58.059]  Hey everybody, Rodney Altbrown here.
[03:17:58.059 --> 03:18:03.420]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[03:18:03.420 --> 03:18:11.042]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[03:18:11.042 --> 03:18:15.623]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[03:18:15.623 --> 03:18:21.964]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[03:18:22.444 --> 03:18:34.009]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship, that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation in the earth today.
[03:18:34.009 --> 03:18:40.572]  We have graduates going all over the world, from the Arctic to the outback, and right here, this is what we do.
[03:18:40.572 --> 03:18:47.375]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for transformation, and that's what you'll do.

[03:18:58.923 --> 03:19:02.906]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:19:02.906 --> 03:19:06.109]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.

[03:19:57.976 --> 03:20:03.858]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.052 --> 03:20:14.673]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.673 --> 03:20:20.015]  Right before the break, I mentioned a recent interview I did with Hope and Tevon, a couple out of Morocco.
[03:20:20.015 --> 03:20:23.637]  That's actually up on the Z-Media tab on band.video right now.
[03:20:23.637 --> 03:20:26.618]  It's also the featured video on zmedia.com.
[03:20:26.618 --> 03:20:28.379]  I really do encourage everyone to watch that.
[03:20:28.379 --> 03:20:34.041]  In that video, there's a lot of discussion around this technology, how it integrates with 5G, 6G, the satellites, all of that.
[03:20:34.601 --> 03:20:40.722]  And they mention a particular man named Achildes, who's working on a lot of this tech.
[03:20:40.722 --> 03:20:45.783]  And he actually slips up in one of his presentations, and we've got evidence of it.
[03:20:45.783 --> 03:20:52.044]  This is on YouTube, where he talks about the COVID shots being essentially programmable technology.
[03:20:52.044 --> 03:21:00.025]  And so I think that what we said before, and what Celeste said before, a lot of this tech supersedes many people's understanding.
[03:21:00.025 --> 03:21:02.306]  But Celeste is going to give us some more insight.
[03:21:02.306 --> 03:21:04.086]  So please, you've got the floor Celeste.
[03:21:05.649 --> 03:21:10.594]  Okay, so this is basically, we've entered a time of the real life Hunger Games.
[03:21:10.594 --> 03:21:19.183]  They've arranged that it's a gladiatorial competition between the kinds, which is like humans and animals and plants.
[03:21:19.659 --> 03:21:25.101]  that have always been known and existed on our planet, versus the clades.
[03:21:25.101 --> 03:21:29.943]  And clades are the new synthetic biology that is replacing us.
[03:21:29.943 --> 03:21:32.764]  And they are digitized, so it is programmable.
[03:21:32.764 --> 03:21:35.385]  It also includes things like the selfish gene.
[03:21:35.385 --> 03:21:38.766]  And you guys, I know you've all heard about the selfish gene.
[03:21:38.766 --> 03:21:42.688]  There was Bill Gates, I think, talking about it a while ago.
[03:21:44.857 --> 03:21:48.380]  Now, so we're going to go into the weeds just a little bit.
[03:21:48.380 --> 03:21:52.163]  So there's a weaponization of identity.
[03:21:52.163 --> 03:22:01.571]  So basically, the power elite have decided that you do not have ownership of your identity.
[03:22:01.571 --> 03:22:03.333]  So this is going to play a factor.
[03:22:03.333 --> 03:22:05.835]  We're going to go through this pretty quickly.
[03:22:05.835 --> 03:22:12.240]  That is why they said you will have nothing and be happy that that is your
[03:22:14.115 --> 03:22:16.958]  Partly includes your identity.
[03:22:16.958 --> 03:22:28.970]  And another thing that many of us have not dove into, I did a year ago, is that you will not persist in space and time.
[03:22:29.397 --> 03:22:36.940]  They want to rob you of eternal life or having having a good life here on this planet.
[03:22:36.940 --> 03:22:44.004]  But then they also want to rob you of this eternal life that you're that we are going to have.
[03:22:44.004 --> 03:22:48.226]  So basically, they want to eradicate you for all time.
[03:22:48.226 --> 03:22:51.407]  Then basically, whoops, just a sec.
[03:22:52.455 --> 03:22:56.418]  I just... While you look, that statement's absolutely true.
[03:22:56.418 --> 03:23:03.163]  We're dealing with Satanists here who don't want you to go into the eternal life that you're destined for.
[03:23:03.163 --> 03:23:06.425]  They want you to be damned with them.
[03:23:06.425 --> 03:23:07.746]  Absolutely.
[03:23:07.746 --> 03:23:08.707]  And the bottom line...
[03:23:10.919 --> 03:23:17.702]  Erased for all time, which is what I discovered through synthetic biology and the Soul Catcher series.
[03:23:17.702 --> 03:23:21.364]  But in this process, there are weapon systems.
[03:23:21.364 --> 03:23:25.146]  There's layer upon layer, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it sometime.
[03:23:25.146 --> 03:23:28.167]  And what they do is confuse individuals.
[03:23:28.167 --> 03:23:29.708]  And what have we been noticing?
[03:23:29.708 --> 03:23:33.330]  A lot of people since 2020 have gotten confused.
[03:23:34.242 --> 03:23:44.631]  And they say, notice that they say individuals, you know, the semantic shell game that you see, I see, they say individuals.
[03:23:44.631 --> 03:23:50.656]  So they are not even acknowledging us as humans or mankind.
[03:23:50.656 --> 03:23:55.300]  So they're confusing all of the things, even the synthetic biology is confusion, chaos.
[03:23:57.562 --> 03:24:01.786]  It destroys mankind's perception of themselves.
[03:24:01.786 --> 03:24:06.310]  So basically your identity is who you are, who you think you are.
[03:24:06.310 --> 03:24:13.777]  They are in the process of doing this through their weapon systems and using synthetic biology.
[03:24:13.777 --> 03:24:16.500]  One of the big things that I found in synthetic biology
[03:24:17.305 --> 03:24:18.246]  It's good to be here.
[03:24:49.267 --> 03:24:51.089]  Just the physicality.
[03:24:51.089 --> 03:24:55.073]  All the things that we knew and took for granted, they're erasing.
[03:24:55.073 --> 03:24:59.837]  Let me make sure that I'm understanding you right here, Celeste.
[03:24:59.837 --> 03:25:09.687]  So when we're saying that the whole concept of synthetic biology is they're recreating our biology the way that they want it to work or be programmed.
[03:25:10.027 --> 03:25:22.317]  And so when you're saying they're breaking down even things like fruits and vegetables to that molecular level and re-engineering them, that also would react with the human biology when consuming that.
[03:25:22.317 --> 03:25:32.164]  And so all of these things are integrated and the weapon systems that you're talking about, I'm presuming, have to do with the frequencies in 5G and other, you know, EMF.
[03:25:32.164 --> 03:25:34.166]  Am I right?
[03:25:34.166 --> 03:25:35.167]  Absolutely.
[03:25:35.167 --> 03:25:35.847]  Absolutely.
[03:25:35.847 --> 03:25:39.490]  Because where does synthetic biology get its orders from?
[03:25:40.057 --> 03:25:44.861]  It's from the 5G, 6G, 7G.
[03:25:44.861 --> 03:25:47.282]  That's what's driving it, kind of.
[03:25:47.282 --> 03:25:49.484]  It's the driver of the car.
[03:25:49.484 --> 03:25:57.890]  You can think of synthetic biology as kind of a vehicle, a transport vehicle, and it will transport many things and it will do.
[03:25:57.890 --> 03:26:03.154]  Synthetic biology at its core changes your function and my function.
[03:26:03.154 --> 03:26:05.756]  We had a function when we were born and a calling.
[03:26:07.501 --> 03:26:22.290]  And it changes our function down at the molecular level to do something else, to serve the agenda that we don't consciously, at this point, I don't agree with.
[03:26:22.290 --> 03:26:29.214]  And so basically they're turning things like our hair into hair bots that will suck out the UN pollution.
[03:26:30.404 --> 03:26:32.786]  We're just getting a few noises on your answer list.
[03:26:32.786 --> 03:26:35.068]  I don't know if you're getting notifications.
[03:26:35.068 --> 03:26:36.610]  I just want to make you aware of that.
[03:26:36.610 --> 03:26:54.786]  So are you saying that based on this, they're already deploying the weapons system through the frequencies with the fact that they've, you know, the tech that's kind of already inside human beings, and this is being found by
[03:26:55.166 --> 03:27:04.209]  So many people around the world, Dr Anna Mihaiča, along with Clifford Carnicom, Karen Kingston, spoken about this before, former Pfizer employee and biotech analyst.
[03:27:04.209 --> 03:27:07.330]  So there are so many people around the world that are finding this tech.
[03:27:07.330 --> 03:27:11.171]  I've exposed it and brought it up on this broadcast many times.
[03:27:11.171 --> 03:27:17.553]  That's already integrating and this is why we're seeing the explosion of all of this debauchery.
[03:27:17.553 --> 03:27:20.854]  We're seeing this explosion of kids confused about their gender.
[03:27:20.854 --> 03:27:23.395]  Is this the reason it's already being deployed?
[03:27:24.781 --> 03:27:32.505]  Yes, it actually, there were a number of us that were electronically identified in the 50s and 60s through vaccination.
[03:27:32.505 --> 03:27:39.469]  Remember, those were the years that if there was a huge push for vaccination, and so it has been only increasing.
[03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:45.312]  2005 was a pivotal year where it really went operational.
[03:27:45.312 --> 03:27:54.357]  That was, there was a UN mandate for something called the National Animal Identification System, and they consider us animals
[03:27:55.117 --> 03:27:57.078]  And it had three pillars.
[03:27:57.078 --> 03:28:02.300]  All property or everything belongs to the government is pillar one.
[03:28:02.300 --> 03:28:07.462]  Pillar two is all biological life must be electronically identified.
[03:28:07.462 --> 03:28:09.863]  And the third was 24 seven surveillance.
[03:28:09.863 --> 03:28:11.903]  And this is what we're seeing now.
[03:28:11.903 --> 03:28:16.565]  They believe that they own all of us and everything, every cell in us.
[03:28:16.565 --> 03:28:20.827]  And so that they have the right to do an incursion into our body and changes.
[03:28:22.659 --> 03:28:25.441]  I have some interesting facts to add to that.
[03:28:25.441 --> 03:28:29.104]  I just did a three-part series on biodigital convergence.
[03:28:29.642 --> 03:28:32.004]  For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's up on Zaymedia.com.
[03:28:32.004 --> 03:28:33.965]  I really encourage people to watch it.
[03:28:33.965 --> 03:28:41.131]  And I include a paper written by legal experts on this difference between an owned human and a pwned human.
[03:28:41.131 --> 03:28:48.076]  Who owns the human now that this technology is inside of them when we consider the Internet of Bodies, Internet of Things?
[03:28:48.076 --> 03:28:50.358]  These people actually think they own you.
[03:28:50.358 --> 03:28:52.820]  We'll get into that a little bit more on the other side of this break.
[03:28:52.820 --> 03:28:54.822]  Don't go anywhere, this is mind-blowing stuff!
[03:28:56.653 --> 03:29:01.378]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[03:29:01.378 --> 03:29:03.460]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[03:29:03.460 --> 03:29:05.382]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[03:29:05.382 --> 03:29:07.864]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[03:29:07.864 --> 03:29:08.665]  Hey, what's better?
[03:29:08.665 --> 03:29:09.526]  Knockout?
[03:29:09.526 --> 03:29:10.867]  What's better?
[03:29:10.867 --> 03:29:11.608]  Down-and-out?
[03:29:11.608 --> 03:29:12.149]  What's better?
[03:29:12.149 --> 03:29:14.411]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:29:14.411 --> 03:29:19.336]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[03:29:20.026 --> 03:29:23.991]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:29:23.991 --> 03:29:25.332]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:29:25.332 --> 03:29:26.634]  They're all very diverse.
[03:29:26.634 --> 03:29:36.825]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[03:29:37.546 --> 03:29:43.169]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[03:29:43.169 --> 03:29:47.711]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.
[03:29:47.711 --> 03:29:51.693]  So get your M4 Wars MD, good night's sleep today, at M4WarsWare.com.
[03:29:56.826 --> 03:30:03.191]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:30:03.191 --> 03:30:09.616]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:30:09.616 --> 03:30:12.978]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:30:12.978 --> 03:30:22.165]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:30:22.165 --> 03:30:22.606]  Look it up.
[03:30:23.226 --> 03:30:24.587]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[03:30:38.471 --> 03:30:40.112]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:30:40.112 --> 03:30:43.333]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:30:43.333 --> 03:30:44.754]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:30:44.754 --> 03:30:48.515]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[03:30:53.880 --> 03:30:55.181]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:30:55.181 --> 03:30:56.522]  You need this filter.
[03:30:56.522 --> 03:30:58.264]  Turbo Force is back.
[03:30:58.264 --> 03:31:00.025]  Sold out for eight months.
[03:31:00.025 --> 03:31:01.527]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:31:01.527 --> 03:31:03.709]  We made it even stronger.
[03:31:03.709 --> 03:31:07.452]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:31:07.452 --> 03:31:11.676]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:11.676 --> 03:31:12.396]  It's not just
[03:31:15.679 --> 03:31:20.740]  Wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:31:20.740 --> 03:31:22.500]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:31:22.500 --> 03:31:35.563]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:31:35.563 --> 03:31:37.563]  It is the super fuel.
[03:31:37.563 --> 03:31:39.043]  RainForce Plus is great.
[03:31:39.043 --> 03:31:39.903]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:31:39.903 --> 03:31:40.863]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:31:40.863 --> 03:31:42.044]  They go good with this.
[03:31:42.044 --> 03:31:44.064]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:31:44.801 --> 03:31:46.282]  This is the boss.
[03:31:46.282 --> 03:31:47.022]  TurboForce.
[03:31:47.022 --> 03:31:48.043]  Back in stock.
[03:31:48.043 --> 03:31:49.043]  Discounted.

[03:31:51.645 --> 03:31:52.645]  More strength.
[03:31:52.645 --> 03:31:56.368]  More energy.
[03:31:56.368 --> 03:32:11.296]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:32:11.716 --> 03:32:13.417]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:32:13.417 --> 03:32:16.398]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:32:16.398 --> 03:32:18.019]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:32:18.019 --> 03:32:22.941]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:32:22.941 --> 03:32:24.681]  This is something you need now.
[03:32:24.681 --> 03:32:29.243]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[03:32:29.243 --> 03:32:34.965]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:32:34.965 --> 03:32:41.128]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[03:32:41.428 --> 03:32:44.809]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.278 --> 03:33:17.323]  And we are back with my special guest Celeste Solem.
[03:33:17.323 --> 03:33:25.715]  You know, while humanity is fighting against the New World Order, one of the biggest components of that fight is the fight against transhumanism.
[03:33:25.715 --> 03:33:29.040]  And so many people may not be aware that this is
[03:33:29.620 --> 03:33:32.302]  Something that's already a very real threat.
[03:33:32.302 --> 03:33:38.387]  I just read an article this morning, Celeste, about someone creating a rival to chat GPT.
[03:33:38.387 --> 03:33:42.029]  This thing is already being weaponised to hack people.
[03:33:42.029 --> 03:33:46.933]  And, you know, one of the last callers was talking about deep fakes and things of this nature.
[03:33:46.933 --> 03:33:49.235]  But we're talking about something even beyond that.
[03:33:49.975 --> 03:33:54.179]  So what links do we think there are, Celeste?
[03:33:54.179 --> 03:34:01.244]  Because you're right, there's been this explosion in kids just being confused about their identity.
[03:34:01.244 --> 03:34:07.109]  Of course, that's partly due to the education indoctrination centres that they call schools.
[03:34:07.109 --> 03:34:12.514]  And it's also because of the culture and social media and all of this.
[03:34:12.514 --> 03:34:14.115]  But are we saying that there's more to it?
[03:34:15.421 --> 03:34:16.441]  There is more to it.
[03:34:16.441 --> 03:34:19.582]  So let's look briefly at a person.
[03:34:19.582 --> 03:34:32.807]  So only a legal person has rights and a person can be like the government or whatever.
[03:34:32.807 --> 03:34:36.028]  It doesn't necessarily have to be a human.
[03:34:37.133 --> 03:34:50.726]  Think about the ramifications when we talk about synthetic biology, which in synthetic biology, they mix all these different creatures, nanobots, plants, insects into your DNA.
[03:34:50.726 --> 03:34:55.110]  So you're like, just this mixed soup, so to speak.
[03:34:55.110 --> 03:35:02.957]  And then, but only a legal person, and they're not saying a legal man or woman,
[03:35:03.718 --> 03:35:09.682]  So you are looking at a time when we have no rights as a man or a woman.
[03:35:09.682 --> 03:35:19.329]  As a matter of fact, hopefully in the next segment, we'll just deep dive really quick and go through what they are doing to sexuality.
[03:35:19.329 --> 03:35:27.035]  Because basically they say, the powers that be, say you don't have a right to your own sexuality.
[03:35:27.035 --> 03:35:32.299]  Your sexuality is determined by hormones, environment, and
[03:35:33.115 --> 03:35:38.860]  And anything that we give you, but you don't own your sexuality.
[03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:44.184]  And so this is... You all know what Harari has said, that AI is going to tell you if you're gay.
[03:35:44.184 --> 03:35:47.266]  You don't know if you're gay, AI is going to tell you if you are.
[03:35:47.266 --> 03:35:48.788]  So these are statements that have been made.
[03:35:48.788 --> 03:35:49.468]  You're not wrong.
[03:35:49.468 --> 03:35:49.969]  Keep going.
[03:35:49.969 --> 03:35:50.429]  We have time.
[03:35:51.775 --> 03:35:59.697]  Yeah, so let's just dive into the, well, I want to talk about something that I discovered.
[03:35:59.697 --> 03:36:14.820]  I was on a legal forum in the 1990s, and it was between academia and the lawyers, and they were discussing who has got supremacy on the earth, whether it's human or whether it's animal.
[03:36:14.820 --> 03:36:20.861]  And it was decided already in the 1990s that humans have primacy in the law.
[03:36:21.497 --> 03:36:22.558]  Over humans.
[03:36:22.558 --> 03:36:26.742]  And then I watched that happen at work.
[03:36:26.742 --> 03:36:29.704]  You know, the day came there was a disaster.
[03:36:29.704 --> 03:36:34.068]  And this guy calls up and he says, Can I save my property?
[03:36:34.068 --> 03:36:37.251]  Can I do whatever I need to do to save my property?
[03:36:37.251 --> 03:36:44.578]  And we had to say, because the Corps of Engineers said no, that was the first time we had to say no, because of the fish.
[03:36:45.490 --> 03:36:50.553]  But so the guy hung up, it was before caller ID, I thought he was safe.
[03:36:50.553 --> 03:36:56.437]  But when I was back at FEMA, they had installed some satellites.
[03:36:56.437 --> 03:36:59.339]  And they actually took pictures.
[03:36:59.339 --> 03:37:10.486]  And this guy comes out from the bottom of where I work with, like pictures of every little rock, like this big.
[03:37:10.486 --> 03:37:12.167]  So they were monitoring.
[03:37:12.167 --> 03:37:14.388]  So basically, humans
[03:37:15.069 --> 03:37:16.530]  No longer have rights.
[03:37:16.530 --> 03:37:20.673]  We have to abdicate to animals.
[03:37:20.673 --> 03:37:24.776]  That set the stage for what they're doing now with this transhumanism.
[03:37:24.776 --> 03:37:37.386]  So now anything has a right over human, including artificial and synthetic, a synth, something that is a synthetic humanoid,
[03:37:37.691 --> 03:37:41.733]  That is not even a human at all, has nothing human.
[03:37:41.733 --> 03:37:47.836]  It looks human, but it has artificial blood, artificial organs, artificial brain.
[03:37:47.836 --> 03:37:51.657]  It can be inhabited by demonic entities.
[03:37:51.657 --> 03:38:06.484]  So it set the stage and a precedent so that that that is considered a legal individual, not a human or not, not a person, a man or a woman.
[03:38:07.802 --> 03:38:15.551]  Well, what you're talking about is incredibly complicated, but I'm going to do my best to sort of break this down and explain how it's the case.
[03:38:15.551 --> 03:38:20.778]  So that's not what we believe, and that's not what God says, but that's what the globalist mentality is.
[03:38:20.778 --> 03:38:24.763]  And I referenced these legal papers that I was reading.
[03:38:25.183 --> 03:38:34.731]  As part of the Biodigital Convergence Series, and there was a discussion about whether a human being was owned or pwned, and they gave the example of a pacemaker.
[03:38:34.731 --> 03:38:42.196]  When someone has a pacemaker installed in them, the people that have created that pacemaker own that pacemaker.
[03:38:42.196 --> 03:38:53.045]  So they were talking about, okay, well, when we're looking at synthetic biology and all of this tech being inside the human, weaved inside them and linking them to the Internet of Bodies,
[03:38:53.903 --> 03:39:00.008]  Is that human being now owned because they're essentially integrated with the technology of the creators?
[03:39:00.008 --> 03:39:09.816]  And so it really was not able the paper was not able to answer the question because again, if the pacemaker is owned by the maker and they're now
[03:39:10.716 --> 03:39:20.082]  They're changing the human being with their tech, and we're talking about technology that goes in and essentially hacks your brain neurons.
[03:39:20.082 --> 03:39:24.165]  It creates new neurons and overcomes your existing brain neurons.
[03:39:24.165 --> 03:39:31.250]  I know it sounds wacky, but this is absolutely evidenced in their peer-reviewed papers, in so many publications on nanotech.
[03:39:31.650 --> 03:39:42.059]  So am I correct then in my explanation, Celeste, of how this actually becomes a reality for those creating this technology?
[03:39:42.059 --> 03:39:50.847]  Back in 2005, we found out with this National Animal Identification System that the government was all the different.
[03:39:50.847 --> 03:39:56.592]  You were issued when you were electronically identified an alphanumeric number with the country code in front.
[03:39:57.358 --> 03:40:01.299]  That put the government in first position of owning.
[03:40:01.299 --> 03:40:17.945]  Then in the 1990s, we also saw, remember that genetically modified farm that was right next to an organic farm and the wind blew and it blew the genetic, the Monsanto pollen over to the organic farm.
[03:40:17.945 --> 03:40:22.226]  It went to court and it set the precedent because they were found that
[03:40:22.847 --> 03:40:27.850]  The organic farm stole the property of Monsanto.
[03:40:27.850 --> 03:40:32.593]  So what you're talking about, now we have synthetic biology.
[03:40:32.593 --> 03:40:33.693]  Let me explain.
[03:40:33.693 --> 03:40:38.556]  In one of the, it can be in a therapeutic, it can be in a vaccine.
[03:40:38.556 --> 03:40:40.957]  It has a substrate, which is a foundation.
[03:40:40.957 --> 03:40:43.299]  This is nano-sized.
[03:40:43.299 --> 03:40:46.160]  This is at the molecular level or atomic level.
[03:40:46.160 --> 03:40:48.562]  Then there's writing in there.
[03:40:48.562 --> 03:40:50.263]  It's a nano-lithography.
[03:40:50.943 --> 03:40:52.745]  And then they encrypt it.
[03:40:52.745 --> 03:40:55.067]  Now, anything can be in there.
[03:40:55.067 --> 03:41:07.579]  I believe, and I saw evidence in 2005, along with some other lawyers, that they were changing ownership, that there is a change of ownership or a shift.
[03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:21.236]  from you as being this, this person into being owned, and then it's encrypted, it goes into a therapeutic, it goes into a vaccine, it's into goes into your body.
[03:41:21.236 --> 03:41:25.798]  And there is this contract in the blockchain.
[03:41:25.798 --> 03:41:26.238]  And yes,
[03:41:27.190 --> 03:41:32.974]  Given the precedent back in 1990, you are in fact owned.
[03:41:32.974 --> 03:41:35.015]  This is intellectual property.
[03:41:35.015 --> 03:41:41.579]  That's what Monsanto claimed is that this organic farm stole their intellectual property.
[03:41:41.579 --> 03:41:50.525]  And actually, when we take something in, then this has even deeper depths to it.
[03:41:50.525 --> 03:41:54.608]  Yes, then we're owned, but we can transmit this.
[03:41:54.608 --> 03:41:56.569]  Like if I go to shake your hand,
[03:41:57.401 --> 03:42:04.848]  And I have spike protein or any of these sapphire nanocubes in me.
[03:42:04.848 --> 03:42:06.810]  I can actually transmit it.
[03:42:06.810 --> 03:42:11.335]  These are called memetic mind virus.
[03:42:11.335 --> 03:42:12.656]  It can go out.
[03:42:12.656 --> 03:42:13.677]  It's self-spreading.
[03:42:13.677 --> 03:42:14.558]  It's transmissible.
[03:42:15.307 --> 03:42:16.948]  It's been known for a long time.
[03:42:16.948 --> 03:42:20.229]  This is another one of the weapon systems.
[03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:35.454]  So then if I shake your hand, Rhea, and you get it, then you also are owned just by the mere fact that I shook your hand and it was transmitted to you because you're holding that intellectual property.
[03:42:36.773 --> 03:42:38.834]  Very, very interesting.
[03:42:38.834 --> 03:42:40.695]  And I have something to add to that.
[03:42:40.695 --> 03:42:50.478]  From an attorney and an admission in courts, as well as what an Australian court recently said to someone that we interviewed, these people really think like this.
[03:42:50.478 --> 03:42:53.459]  So let's expand on that right after this short break.
[03:42:53.459 --> 03:42:54.320]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:55.220]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.698 --> 03:42:58.880]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:42:58.880 --> 03:43:02.884]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:43:02.884 --> 03:43:06.087]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:43:06.087 --> 03:43:14.315]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:43:14.315 --> 03:43:17.918]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:43:17.918 --> 03:43:18.759]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:43:20.120 --> 03:43:22.821]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day.
[03:43:22.821 --> 03:43:27.383]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:43:27.383 --> 03:43:29.404]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:43:29.404 --> 03:43:31.545]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:43:31.545 --> 03:43:34.346]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[03:43:34.346 --> 03:43:39.449]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.

[03:43:45.131 --> 03:43:45.951]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:43:45.951 --> 03:43:52.953]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:43:52.953 --> 03:43:56.414]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[03:43:56.414 --> 03:44:01.295]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of the Reiss Report.
[03:44:01.295 --> 03:44:04.936]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:04.936 --> 03:44:07.617]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reiss.
[03:44:07.617 --> 03:44:13.539]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[03:44:13.539 --> 03:44:14.299]  Greg, what do you got there?
[03:44:14.795 --> 03:44:23.761]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[03:44:23.761 --> 03:44:30.005]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[03:44:30.005 --> 03:44:30.565]  Absolutely.
[03:44:33.231 --> 03:44:36.032]  Couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[03:44:36.032 --> 03:44:38.854]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[03:44:38.854 --> 03:44:40.574]  The real NPR of The Based Right.
[03:44:40.574 --> 03:44:43.616]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[03:44:43.616 --> 03:44:44.576]  Take out your phone.
[03:44:44.576 --> 03:44:45.677]  Click that QR code.
[03:44:45.677 --> 03:44:47.838]  It'll take you directly to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:47.838 --> 03:44:48.758]  Buy something.
[03:44:48.758 --> 03:44:49.839]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:44:49.839 --> 03:44:54.261]  Keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schwoyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[03:44:54.261 --> 03:44:55.061]  Do it today!
[03:44:55.061 --> 03:44:55.901]  Do it now!
[03:44:55.901 --> 03:44:56.762]  Support the InfoWars!
[03:44:57.642 --> 03:45:04.003]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:45:04.003 --> 03:45:10.425]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:45:10.425 --> 03:45:13.786]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:45:13.786 --> 03:45:22.948]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:45:22.948 --> 03:45:23.408]  Look it up.
[03:45:24.048 --> 03:45:25.408]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:45:25.408 --> 03:45:28.629]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[03:45:28.629 --> 03:45:31.750]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:34.070]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:36.711]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:45:36.711 --> 03:45:38.311]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:45:38.311 --> 03:45:39.292]  It is amazing.
[03:45:39.292 --> 03:45:40.932]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:45:40.932 --> 03:45:44.133]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:45:44.133 --> 03:45:45.573]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:45:45.573 --> 03:45:49.334]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:45:49.634 --> 03:46:01.602]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:46:01.602 --> 03:46:03.923]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:46:03.923 --> 03:46:06.985]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:46:06.985 --> 03:46:11.789]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:46:13.226 --> 03:46:16.772]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:16.772 --> 03:46:23.683]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:46:23.683 --> 03:46:24.584]  It's really just incredible.
[03:46:25.589 --> 03:46:29.231]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:29.231 --> 03:46:35.014]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:46:35.014 --> 03:46:38.055]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:46:38.055 --> 03:46:46.300]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[03:46:47.020 --> 03:46:51.301]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[03:46:51.301 --> 03:46:56.243]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:46:56.243 --> 03:46:58.863]  Please take action now.
[03:46:58.863 --> 03:47:04.745]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.774 --> 03:47:21.985]  Last year, I did an interview with attorney Todd Callender, who's been on this broadcast with me before, and Forbes and USA Today wrote an article about it.
[03:47:21.985 --> 03:47:22.646]  The team have got it.
[03:47:22.646 --> 03:47:25.349]  They'll bring it up on the screen right now.
[03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:28.093]  Todd spoke about the term homoborgenesis.
[03:47:28.353 --> 03:47:28.913]  I don't know.
[03:47:48.160 --> 03:48:02.195]  He's asking, in one of his cases that he was dealing with, whether the court considered human beings their property, because they were now patented based on a US Supreme Court decision many years ago, and they could not answer his question.
[03:48:02.907 --> 03:48:15.335]  Then in Australia in recent times, we had an instance of a gentleman who went into court over a nonsense accusation that he was breaching COVID rules.
[03:48:15.335 --> 03:48:21.038]  You know, I won't get into the details, but he actually said to the judge, Your Honour, am I your property?
[03:48:21.038 --> 03:48:23.620]  And she said, yes, you are actually.
[03:48:24.380 --> 03:48:29.011]  And so at the time I asked the question, how widespread is this thinking?
[03:48:29.011 --> 03:48:31.939]  How widespread is the thinking that human beings are now owned?
[03:48:31.939 --> 03:48:32.720]  Now, again,
[03:48:33.487 --> 03:48:41.490]  We don't believe that, and I'm absolutely no one's property but God Almighty's, but they do because they think they're gods on earth.
[03:48:41.490 --> 03:48:43.170]  They've said this multiple times.
[03:48:43.170 --> 03:49:00.116]  So I think it's a very important conversation that we're having right here with Celeste Solom, because it's important to understand your enemy and how they actually think, and how far will humanity go to have to fight to remain human or retain the essence of humanity?
[03:49:00.116 --> 03:49:03.037]  I mean, Celeste, how far down the path are we?
[03:49:05.675 --> 03:49:08.867]  I would say we're at the endgame and we have a big decision.
[03:49:08.867 --> 03:49:10.594]  Are we going to remain human or not?
[03:49:12.995 --> 03:49:18.617]  For instance, our sexuality, they consider it a construct, a social construct.
[03:49:18.617 --> 03:49:19.858]  It is evolutionary.
[03:49:19.858 --> 03:49:29.021]  That's how Karl Marx fits into this whole picture, because Karl Marx was a devotee of Darwin.
[03:49:29.021 --> 03:49:37.684]  And so everything that they're doing is an evolutionary experiment, either directed evolution or experimental evolution.
[03:49:38.411 --> 03:49:43.333]  And so even our sexuality, they are evolving it.
[03:49:43.333 --> 03:49:47.315]  And why are they doing this?
[03:49:47.315 --> 03:49:50.837]  To cross the dimensional boundaries.
[03:49:50.837 --> 03:49:55.579]  Remember at the beginning, we talked about the barriers that kind of God put in place.
[03:49:55.579 --> 03:49:59.281]  Like my skin is a barrier from lots of bad things.
[03:49:59.281 --> 03:49:59.941]  So
[03:50:02.719 --> 03:50:05.080]  They want to break the bonds.
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:13.042]  In Psalm 2, it talks about humanity throwing off the bonds, the chains that they feel that they have.
[03:50:13.042 --> 03:50:15.263]  And that's what we're seeing.
[03:50:15.263 --> 03:50:21.085]  And now it's drilling down to the family, to sexuality, to our individuality.
[03:50:21.085 --> 03:50:22.366]  Who is a person?
[03:50:22.366 --> 03:50:24.026]  Who isn't a person?
[03:50:24.026 --> 03:50:29.228]  These days, they have defined us right out of
[03:50:30.043 --> 03:50:35.745]  Any rights, legal rights, or privileges, or anything.
[03:50:35.745 --> 03:50:42.987]  It is the same model that they used in World War II against certain populations.
[03:50:42.987 --> 03:50:46.428]  They made them like, they demonized them.
[03:50:46.428 --> 03:50:49.449]  They said they were like apes and that type of thing.
[03:50:49.449 --> 03:50:55.311]  And that's why they went to all this trouble to, in their therapeutics, vaccinations,
[03:50:56.091 --> 03:51:24.015]  To mix it with all these different things so they can say and there's a person called Bruce Lipton He's an evolutionist and he said you're not human you you don't have You've got more Non-human cells in you than you have human and that's their take is that we are not human any longer And that we never have been human and so we can be tinkered with just like you would play with an ant or a
[03:51:24.975 --> 03:51:25.515]  I think so.
[03:51:40.408 --> 03:51:46.690]  And kill us and cause death and suffering every which way you can imagine, including mutilate children and tell you that it's really great.
[03:51:46.690 --> 03:51:58.113]  So the thinking of these people that they own us and that we're nothing makes a lot of sense when you consider all of the other things that they're doing, Celeste.
[03:51:58.113 --> 03:51:59.654]  Absolutely.
[03:51:59.654 --> 03:52:03.395]  So have you looked into APEEL?
[03:52:03.395 --> 03:52:05.855]  It's A-P-E-E-L.
[03:52:05.855 --> 03:52:06.696]  Okay.
[03:52:06.696 --> 03:52:08.276]  Yes, but please share it with the audience.
[03:52:09.602 --> 03:52:36.842]  But that is so it's a spray on it and to put on your fruit and veg we don't do it but the manufacturers and you know when it goes to the big warehouses that type of stuff puts it on to increase shelf life up to a year two years but did you know that that technology is based on it's the technology is actually Medusa and that is a Greek God
[03:52:37.532 --> 03:52:42.514]  that murdered her children to save the cherry crop.
[03:52:42.514 --> 03:52:45.454]  And this is a cherry-based spray.
[03:52:45.454 --> 03:52:59.939]  Now, so it's got a Greek god, goddess, and that is affiliated with the cherries, and she murders her children to save the cherry crop.
[03:52:59.939 --> 03:53:06.081]  Now, today, we're putting it on all of our fruits and vegetables to murder our children
[03:53:08.438 --> 03:53:14.340]  The same to save the planet, to save the planet.
[03:53:14.340 --> 03:53:20.181]  Everything that you're talking about is, you know, incredibly deep Celeste.
[03:53:20.181 --> 03:53:27.743]  I know it's taken you years and years and thousands upon thousands of hours of research to come to some of these conclusions.
[03:53:27.743 --> 03:53:33.805]  Just the other day when I mentioned the real-life vampire that Alex was talking about and he said, how did
[03:53:34.232 --> 03:53:45.020]  How did every single civilization throughout history come to the conclusion that there were evil people coming in the middle of the night to steal the children so they could drink their blood?
[03:53:45.020 --> 03:53:52.906]  How did so many societies come to that conclusion and have that story told throughout their societies?
[03:53:52.906 --> 03:54:00.752]  And the reality is that the globalists and the people that are doing this to us practice a very, very old religion.
[03:54:01.272 --> 03:54:03.834]  It's essentially Satanism.
[03:54:03.834 --> 03:54:08.117]  These occult practices, something that you're talking about, you found the link to Medusa.
[03:54:08.117 --> 03:54:10.638]  Most people would think that's perhaps far-fetched.
[03:54:10.638 --> 03:54:13.900]  No, this is genuinely what these people live and breathe.
[03:54:13.900 --> 03:54:19.904]  They serve a very, very dark spiritual force.
[03:54:19.904 --> 03:54:20.825]  Absolutely.
[03:54:20.825 --> 03:54:22.866]  I mean, I was pretty horrified.
[03:54:22.866 --> 03:54:26.209]  Everybody was talking about it, but they, you know, that's the thing.
[03:54:26.209 --> 03:54:27.689]  We don't dig.
[03:54:27.689 --> 03:54:29.811]  And I think if we are going to preserve
[03:54:30.580 --> 03:54:35.703]  Humanity, man and woman, are kind.
[03:54:35.703 --> 03:54:38.425]  Not our species, because that's evolutionary.
[03:54:38.425 --> 03:54:42.688]  Species is evolutionary, but bottom line, we're kind.
[03:54:42.688 --> 03:54:45.490]  Man and mankind.
[03:54:45.490 --> 03:54:47.511]  We are going to have to dig.
[03:54:47.511 --> 03:54:56.617]  We are, like, I just got, somebody let me know this, I think it was just yesterday, that on Campbell's Soup, now it says,
[03:54:57.245 --> 03:54:59.206]  This is biotechnology.
[03:54:59.206 --> 03:55:01.426]  This is synthetic biology.
[03:55:01.426 --> 03:55:07.728]  On Campbell's soup, chicken noodle soup, this is the soup that your mother would give you when you're not feeling good.
[03:55:07.728 --> 03:55:16.250]  And if you don't dig, if you don't learn a little bit about synthetic biology, you don't have to do what you do and what I do.
[03:55:16.250 --> 03:55:20.451]  But you should have a cursory understanding of it.
[03:55:20.451 --> 03:55:24.052]  I did the webinar for free so that you can have that understanding.
[03:55:25.416 --> 03:55:47.026]  So that you don't get caught in this trap and then all of a sudden you're sick and you have morbidity, you know, you've got things growing inside of you, you may have stroke, you may have heart attack, you may have many, a plethora of different pain, insomnia.
[03:55:47.026 --> 03:55:51.708]  You need to know that this exists and how to take precaution.
[03:55:52.569 --> 03:56:07.028]  And that's why we all need to do and we all need to press into our Creator, quite frankly, because quite frankly, in the Bible, it says that if Jesus didn't cut short the days, there would be no flesh left alive.
[03:56:07.028 --> 03:56:08.290]  That's what we're staring at.
[03:56:09.142 --> 03:56:14.227]  And on top of that, we've got we're moving into the sixth extinction level event.
[03:56:14.227 --> 03:56:22.954]  So the elite knew this, they obscurated it, they classified a document called the Adam and Eve story.
[03:56:22.954 --> 03:56:27.198]  And then they unclassified it about, I don't know, five or six years ago.
[03:56:27.198 --> 03:56:28.079]  And they
[03:56:30.629 --> 03:56:33.410]  It tells about what's going to be happening.
[03:56:33.410 --> 03:56:40.332]  And this is a time, given the magnetosphere and what's happening on our planet, this is a very cyclical event.
[03:56:40.332 --> 03:56:46.634]  The last time this happened, and we're in it, we're in the very beginning of it, 90% of all life went extinct.
[03:56:50.498 --> 03:56:53.883]  But the elite knew ahead of time.
[03:56:53.883 --> 03:56:56.407]  We didn't know, so we couldn't prepare.
[03:56:56.407 --> 03:56:59.732]  But they got their, they're getting their system.
[03:56:59.732 --> 03:57:01.595]  This is a system.
[03:57:01.595 --> 03:57:04.539]  And synthetic biology is a system.
[03:57:04.539 --> 03:57:05.841]  And we have to realize that.
[03:57:06.616 --> 03:57:09.477]  I agree with you Celeste.
[03:57:09.477 --> 03:57:11.378]  We're almost out of time for today.
[03:57:11.378 --> 03:57:13.899]  I could talk to you literally for hours.
[03:57:13.899 --> 03:57:16.960]  We will definitely speak with you again.
[03:57:16.960 --> 03:57:21.522]  Celeste has released a very, very important series on synthetic biology.
[03:57:21.522 --> 03:57:22.943]  It's a four-part webinar.
[03:57:23.323 --> 03:57:25.364]  I do encourage everyone to go and watch that.
[03:57:25.364 --> 03:57:26.564]  You can find her on Rumble.
[03:57:26.564 --> 03:57:30.145]  Her website is also CelestialReport.com.
[03:57:30.145 --> 03:57:38.086]  Just amazing information, amazing research, and most of all, faith in Jesus, which is what we need to get us through this and preserve mankind.
[03:57:38.086 --> 03:57:40.987]  And I know God will give us the strength to do the right thing.
[03:57:40.987 --> 03:57:43.087]  Thank you so much for tuning in today.

[03:58:10.342 --> 03:58:11.443]  So please do that as well.
[03:58:11.443 --> 03:58:16.687]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[03:58:16.687 --> 03:58:18.288]  But these really are amazing products.
[03:58:18.288 --> 03:58:20.370]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[03:58:20.370 --> 03:58:22.992]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:58:22.992 --> 03:58:24.974]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[03:58:24.974 --> 03:58:26.375]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:58:26.375 --> 03:58:28.497]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[03:58:29.057 --> 03:58:31.458]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[03:58:31.458 --> 03:58:32.398]  I know times are tough.
[03:58:32.398 --> 03:58:33.839]  So thank you for your support.
[03:58:33.839 --> 03:58:38.941]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos that you can do for free.
[03:58:38.941 --> 03:58:41.122]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[03:58:41.122 --> 03:58:43.442]  So however, God leads you in your heart to support us.
[03:58:43.442 --> 03:58:44.343]  Please support us now.
[03:58:44.343 --> 03:58:46.023]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:58:46.023 --> 03:58:52.046]  God bless you.
[03:58:52.046 --> 03:58:53.466]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:53.466 --> 03:58:55.387]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:55.387 --> 03:58:55.987]  It is.
[03:58:55.987 --> 03:58:57.568]  But if you took it with bish oil,
[03:58:58.821 --> 03:59:00.863]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[03:59:00.863 --> 03:59:02.204]  The fish oil's better than it.
[03:59:02.204 --> 03:59:04.026]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:59:04.026 --> 03:59:06.508]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:59:06.508 --> 03:59:08.149]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:09.631]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:09.631 --> 03:59:11.112]  Krill oil is the best.
[03:59:11.112 --> 03:59:12.453]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:59:12.453 --> 03:59:13.194]  And I'm sorry.
[03:59:13.194 --> 03:59:14.315]  You want something like this?
[03:59:14.315 --> 03:59:15.275]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:15.275 --> 03:59:17.197]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:59:17.197 --> 03:59:17.818]  It's so good.
[03:59:17.818 --> 03:59:18.418]  In my view.
[03:59:18.418 --> 03:59:20.760]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:59:20.760 --> 03:59:23.462]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:59:23.462 --> 03:59:25.064]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:26.832 --> 03:59:34.336]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:34.336 --> 03:59:40.379]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:40.379 --> 03:59:41.499]  I just can't do it!
[03:59:41.499 --> 03:59:48.743]  InfoOrStory.com!
[03:59:48.743 --> 03:59:54.646]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
