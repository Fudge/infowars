[00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.096]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:31.462]  That's right, and you have found it.
[00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:33.564]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.874]  There is so much news to get through today.
[00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:49.119]  And luckily, I'm going to have seven hours to do it, because there's no way you could fill it in a four-hour transmission.
[00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:54.202]  Plus, we have big guests coming up today as well.
[00:00:54.202 --> 00:01:00.206]  And I'll let you know the guests that we have coming up after this short intro segment.
[00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:14.386]  But I'm just overwhelmed trying to decide what is the biggest story going on and we can kind of maybe rank them from most important to least, but they're all important.
[00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:17.967]  They all have a serious level of importance.
[00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:48.210]  Now obviously the big story the last two days has been the Pfizer executive getting caught on a hidden camera where he's talking about, bragging about, gain-of-function research, lies about COVID, lies about the vaccine, really just in a truly diabolical, evil, twisted, wicked display of arrogance and entitlement
[00:01:50.416 --> 00:02:00.743]  And just really an expose on how out of touch with reality, how out of touch with the common man these individuals are.
[00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:11.571]  And while we don't know Jordan Thriston, the Pfizer executive's politics, while we don't know his politics,
[00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:18.535]  I'll tell you, I'm confident enough to bet my house on where he lies politically.
[00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.738]  That'd be a little too bold or pretty safe bet.
[00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:26.721]  How much you want to bet, that guy's a liberal Democrat.
[00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.484]  I'd bet my house on it.
[00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:36.948]  So, but that's just a common trend that we're going to follow up with today.
[00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:43.073]  And look, I don't even necessarily know what the outcome for all of this is.
[00:02:44.994 --> 00:02:54.137]  To just expose the psychology of liberal left Americans, to expose the ideology and psychology of the American left.
[00:02:54.137 --> 00:03:06.861]  And I was thinking about this last night, I don't know why, but of all of Rush Limbaugh's years on the air, this is the one thing that he had right, and he was way above his time with.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.321]  He always warned you what the American left was really about.
[00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:25.264]  He always told you that American liberals were pretty much faking all of their virtue signaling, social justicing, they're the moral high ground, they're your moral superiors.
[00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:30.146]  Rush Limbaugh had that tagged day one, warning us about the American left.
[00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:31.406]  But we're really seeing it now.
[00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:39.764]  We are really seeing it now, and it's not just this Pfizer executive.
[00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:41.264]  It goes beyond that.
[00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:44.165]  These people truly despise you.
[00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:45.945]  These people truly hate humanity.
[00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:51.166]  They really have it in them to wreck civilization.
[00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:55.947]  I mean, you are witnessing it now, and it's funny to them.
[00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:56.648]  It's funny to them.
[00:03:56.648 --> 00:03:59.208]  It's a game to them.
[00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:00.489]  But I digress.
[00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.889]  I'll have more on that issue
[00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:04.328]  But again, what's the goal?
[00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.649]  What's the end game?
[00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:06.169]  Well, I don't know.
[00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:27.575]  Maybe it's a service of warning you not to put any faith or trust in American liberals, Democrats, or maybe it's just a public shaming so that people will no longer be tricked and deceived into going with the American left liberal, realizing who and what they really are now.
[00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:30.461]  And so I've got a bunch of that.
[00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.683]  But then, I mean, there's big Biden news.
[00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:41.506]  And the big Biden news, with his corruption, is probably number three on the most important, because of what's going on in Russia.
[00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:45.367]  With Ukraine, which really might be the most important.
[00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:47.208]  Because we're talking about World War III, and I mean...
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.183]  Unofficially, Joe Biden has already declared World War III against Russia.
[00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:57.664]  With his own words, as we showed you yesterday.
[00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.165]  But now they're just ramping it up more.
[00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:07.791]  Early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:16.177]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[00:05:16.177 --> 00:05:18.419]  So I thank you for your passion for support.
[00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.264]  Now, that was a three coin series, the founding member coin, the final coin that we're putting out for a long time.
[00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:32.700]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com?
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.484]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[00:05:38.484 --> 00:05:41.726]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:42.667]  We're good to go.
[00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.732]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:20.258]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:06:20.258 --> 00:06:29.604]  I've got to tell you, I'm overwhelmed with the news today.
[00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:33.247]  And it's not that I'm overwhelmed with the news and, oh my gosh, how am I going to cover it?
[00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:40.774]  No, I can come on air, I can talk about news for ten hours.
[00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:53.681]  No, the issue is that I'm sitting here staring all of this down, just like you are, and just wondering, will there ever be anybody serious enough
[00:06:54.943 --> 00:07:00.124]  With enough gumption and gall in positions of leadership to do something.
[00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:02.125]  Why is Pfizer still operating today?
[00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.145]  Why is Pfizer not being investigated?
[00:07:04.145 --> 00:07:07.066]  Why aren't there raids on Pfizer?
[00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:16.708]  Hell, forget about that deranged maniac they have bragging about doing gain-of-function research on a grinder date.
[00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:22.028]  How about the fact they lied about the vaccines?
[00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:23.569]  We know they lied about the vaccines.
[00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.049]  They knew they lied about the vaccines.
[00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:29.971]  They're killing tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people.
[00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:34.033]  Got a whole stack of... died suddenly to death.
[00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:34.493]  By the way, um...
[00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:38.348]  You know, InfoWars hasn't really made a big fuss of this.
[00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:57.271]  I've mentioned it a couple of times, and maybe I'll mention it at some point in time today, but all the conspiracy theories out there about DeMar Hamlin and his appearance at the football game, I have reached a conclusion on what's going on there, and now pretty much we have all the evidence to know what's really going on.
[00:07:57.271 --> 00:07:59.452]  So I may talk about that, too.
[00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.871]  But it's the same thing.
[00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:08.354]  They don't want you to ask the question, was DeMar Hamlin vaccinated?
[00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:12.296]  And is that what led to his cardiac event on the football field?
[00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:19.100]  But in the last 24 hours, two other football players have died suddenly.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.781]  Oh!
[00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.243]  But they aren't current football players.
[00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:28.246]  They didn't die on the football field of a nationally televised game.
[00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:39.289]  And so they also didn't have the team of paramedics and the emergency crew right there on the field immediately, so they didn't make it.
[00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.951]  And they don't make the headlines.
[00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:42.513]  But we'll talk about it.
[00:08:42.513 --> 00:08:48.820]  So forget about the executive Jordan Thurston Walker and his deranged behavior there.
[00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:57.578]  Uh, no, it's this vaccine is killing people and they knew it was going to and they still lied to you about it.
[00:08:57.578 --> 00:09:06.367]  And then now we just have, thanks to Project Veritas, insider accounts of this exact operation.
[00:09:07.682 --> 00:09:10.264]  And you tell me why Pfizer is still operating.
[00:09:10.264 --> 00:09:18.411]  You tell me why there isn't a big Senate hearing, congressional hearing, speech on the Capitol steps, big mainstream media push.
[00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:30.062]  Only individual across all cable news last night, you can take a guess, who do you think was the only person that played any of the Project Veritas videos last night?
[00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:31.383]  Yeah, Tucker Carlson.
[00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:32.243]  That's it.
[00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:33.364]  No one else.
[00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:33.745]  No one else.
[00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.427]  No one else wanted to make a big deal about that.
[00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:40.267]  Hmm.
[00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.527]  Why wouldn't Sean Hannity want to talk about the vaccine?
[00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:46.108]  Oh, that's right, he promoted it and told you how great it was.
[00:09:46.108 --> 00:09:47.088]  Ah.
[00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:49.449]  Guess he doesn't want to talk about that.
[00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:53.650]  Guess he doesn't want to talk about Tide suddenly.
[00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.130]  So, that's the problem.
[00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:02.312]  Pfizer controls Congress with its money, power, and influence.
[00:10:02.312 --> 00:10:03.992]  Along with other big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.925]  And the same thing goes for the mainstream media.
[00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:17.519]  And so now, that little ad we run, that commercial we run, or that special report, really, I mean most of our breaks are special reports.
[00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.181]  It's like half ads, half special reports.
[00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:26.489]  Where we're just running all these different news clips or sports clips, and then what does it say?
[00:10:26.489 --> 00:10:27.529]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:28.530]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.530]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.531]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:31.492]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:32.452]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:32.452 --> 00:10:34.433]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:35.814]  Oh, now you understand.
[00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:38.376]  Why weren't there raids of Pfizer?
[00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.077]  Why aren't there big investigations?
[00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:44.279]  Why aren't there products being recalled?
[00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:46.060]  Because Pfizer owns the media.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.621]  Because Pfizer owns the government.
[00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.692]  You're witnessing pure evil.
[00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:57.377]  You are witnessing pure corruption.
[00:10:57.377 --> 00:10:59.799]  So, again, that's what I was saying at the beginning of the show.
[00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:02.061]  It's like, look, I can cover the news all day.
[00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.842]  I have no problem covering news.
[00:11:03.842 --> 00:11:05.243]  Believe me.
[00:11:05.243 --> 00:11:08.006]  I could sit on here for ten hours a day and cover news.
[00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:08.826]  That's fine.
[00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:10.848]  You know what's going on.
[00:11:10.848 --> 00:11:16.233]  We have millions, if not hundreds of millions of Americans that now know what's going on more than ever.
[00:11:18.154 --> 00:11:26.200]  And so it's reached this point where, you know, you kind of feel like InfoWars, I mean, we want to be here forever, folks.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:33.586]  You continue to shop at InfoWarsStore.com, you continue to donate at InfoWarsStore.com, you continue to buy the products, share the links, pray for us, support us.
[00:11:33.586 --> 00:11:34.667]  We're not going anywhere.
[00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:38.189]  We have no intentions of going anywhere.
[00:11:38.189 --> 00:11:47.777]  But I kind of feel like, you know, at some point there was supposed to be a handing off of the torch, or there was supposed to be a handing off of the
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:57.465]  Whatever it is they call it in the race, I can't even think of it now, I'm having a total brain fart.
[00:11:57.465 --> 00:11:58.326]  But you get the point.
[00:11:58.326 --> 00:12:16.762]  A passing of the torch, where, okay, it's like, here's the Pfizer executives bragging about the gain of function, here's the Pfizer executives bragging they know it was in Wuhan, here's the Pfizer executives talking about how they're making viruses to have a vaccine to sell you in response to,
[00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:21.778]  Anybody want to take the torch on this one?
[00:12:21.778 --> 00:12:32.822]  I mean, I can sit here for 10 hours a day, 24 hours a day, if there's a hundred hours in the day, and tell you about what's going on.
[00:12:32.822 --> 00:12:37.043]  Okay, when is someone from the Justice Department going to pick up the torch?
[00:12:37.043 --> 00:12:44.586]  When is somebody from the FBI, the CIA, Congress, the White House, anybody?
[00:12:44.586 --> 00:12:47.347]  Or does Pfizer, does Big Pharma really have that much
[00:12:48.783 --> 00:12:51.544]  Ownership over our media and over our government.
[00:12:51.544 --> 00:12:53.165]  So we'll have more on that.
[00:12:53.165 --> 00:13:03.248]  Really though, even though that's a huge news story, maybe the biggest in the country right now, all things considered, what's happening in Ukraine is a bigger deal.
[00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:15.053]  And by Joe Biden's own admissions, though clunky and unintentional, Joe Biden has unofficially and illegally launched World War III against Russia.
[00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:21.433]  And some other leaders on the planet realize this.
[00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:32.150]  Now most leaders that are witnessing this are really just keeping their mouth shut because they kind of just want to see where it goes.
[00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:46.629]  But that's different than the normal approach from years past, where there'd be much more support of the Western interventionism, or there'd be much more support over whatever the military-industrial complex is up to.
[00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:49.031]  But on this deal, it ain't there, folks.
[00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:51.133]  The international support is not there.
[00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:54.335]  They had to beg Germany to give those tanks up.
[00:13:54.335 --> 00:13:54.896]  Beg!
[00:13:54.896 --> 00:13:57.398]  And it took months.
[00:13:57.398 --> 00:14:02.142]  And the only reason why it went down is because, here's the new lie about Russia,
[00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:10.847]  Yeah, look, I didn't even see this headline today, but it's just right on par with what I'm saying.
[00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:11.968]  Oh, oh, it's madness!
[00:14:11.968 --> 00:14:17.212]  France and Croatia deny West at war with Russia after German Foreign Minister sparks outrage.
[00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:20.896]  I don't think that's a good headline from Zero Hedge.
[00:14:20.896 --> 00:14:26.921]  They're basically saying, no, we don't want war with Russia.
[00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:30.325]  They're not saying the West is, they're saying we are not at war with Russia.
[00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:33.632]  The Biden administration, the U.S.
[00:14:33.632 --> 00:14:35.253]  is trying to start a war with Russia.
[00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:35.713]  Not us.
[00:14:35.713 --> 00:14:40.435]  We don't want anything to do with this.
[00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:42.736]  But so that's the point here.
[00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:50.540]  You have basically the Polish who have their own historical beefs with Russia, just frothing at the mouth for a war with Russia.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.001]  I don't get that one at all.
[00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.282]  Truly just weirdness from the Polish.
[00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:58.992]  And so they're begging Biden to do something.
[00:14:58.992 --> 00:15:01.393]  They're begging Germany to do something.
[00:15:01.393 --> 00:15:08.215]  And the big threat now is they're claiming that Russia is going to go into Europe, and Russia's going to go into Poland, and Russia's going to go into Germany.
[00:15:08.215 --> 00:15:09.956]  You know, I don't think that that's a threat.
[00:15:09.956 --> 00:15:12.077]  I would say that's a 0% threat.
[00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:17.178]  But now... Now that Poland is stoking the war?
[00:15:17.178 --> 00:15:19.119]  Now that Germany is supplying tanks?
[00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:21.900]  Well, geez!
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.861]  Bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy there, isn't it?
[00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:27.924]  Putin had no intentions to go into Europe.
[00:15:27.924 --> 00:15:35.166]  Putin had no intentions to do any operations or military activity outside of Ukraine.
[00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:35.807]  Zero.
[00:15:35.807 --> 00:15:36.287]  Zero.
[00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:37.047]  Zero.
[00:15:37.047 --> 00:15:50.232]  But what are you going to do now if Poland and Germany and the rest of these countries, under the influence of Joe Biden, the most corrupt politician on the planet probably, well now what is Putin supposed to do?
[00:15:51.957 --> 00:15:55.038]  Well, we know what's about to happen, folks, and it's not good.
[00:15:55.038 --> 00:16:01.101]  And we have a psychotic leadership dragging us into war again.
[00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:04.242]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:16:04.242 --> 00:16:06.543]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:16:06.543 --> 00:16:10.484]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:14.406]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:19.413]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:26.296]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:16:26.296 --> 00:16:27.197]  It's really just incredible.
[00:16:28.217 --> 00:16:31.839]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:37.642]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:16:37.642 --> 00:16:48.928]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[00:16:49.628 --> 00:16:53.909]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWars.com.
[00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:58.870]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.931]  Please take action now.
[00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:02.971]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[00:17:02.971 --> 00:17:05.752]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[00:17:05.752 --> 00:17:11.153]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:13.354]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:19.922]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:17:19.922 --> 00:17:24.304]  It's finally back in stock for 50% off at importrestore.com.
[00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:30.227]  Now, in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it, but this sucker is amazing.
[00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:35.530]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.892]  Every one of these will supercharge your day in everything you do.
[00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.754]  Just look at the Preglanone that we've got that's in this product.

[00:17:56.268 --> 00:17:57.770]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:00.052 --> 00:18:06.215]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[00:18:06.215 --> 00:18:19.201]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarStore.com right now and taking action.
[00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:24.143]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[00:18:24.563 --> 00:18:26.204]  Steve, InfoWars on the air.
[00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:28.506]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:29.967]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:18:29.967 --> 00:18:31.228]  They're coming for me.
[00:18:31.228 --> 00:18:32.449]  They're coming for the children.
[00:18:32.449 --> 00:18:35.031]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:38.434]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[00:18:38.434 --> 00:18:39.955]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:42.057]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[00:18:42.057 --> 00:18:47.081]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:51.386]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[00:18:51.386 --> 00:18:52.608]  Let's do it together.
[00:18:52.608 --> 00:18:54.911]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:54.911 --> 00:18:58.715]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:58.715 --> 00:18:59.697]  Now take action now!
[00:19:01.581 --> 00:19:06.403]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[00:19:06.403 --> 00:19:14.265]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:17.806]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:26.389]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:34.241]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at Mega Corporation.
[00:19:35.077 --> 00:19:45.501]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:48.222]  You will then be my slaves.
[00:19:48.222 --> 00:19:53.484]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:58.966]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[00:20:01.249 --> 00:20:07.154]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:22.136 --> 00:20:24.357]  Alright, cut off by the break.
[00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:26.557]  Talking about, I don't know, kind of a serious issue.
[00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:27.858]  World War III, potentially.
[00:20:27.858 --> 00:20:31.119]  Eh, you know, kind of a serious issue.
[00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:36.120]  And, again, I just... I don't even have time to delve into it.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.661]  We do have guests coming up today.
[00:20:37.661 --> 00:20:42.462]  I've got a guest coming up about the current state of the economy, and then we've got guests coming up about...
[00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:47.642]  The situation with the vaccines and airline pilots, and they know now.
[00:20:47.642 --> 00:21:09.880]  I mean, everybody's making the adjustments knowing, okay, well, the average risk of a heart attack is skyrocketing now because of all these people taking the vaccine, so now we have to adjust our health protocols, and specific requests for pilots are being made that are not vaccinated because they don't want to have a cardiac event while they're being flown around the world.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.761]  Amazing stuff.
[00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:17.905]  And then, it's like, I can't even barely mention the leftist riots that are still going on.
[00:21:17.905 --> 00:21:21.487]  Oh, no, no, no, you don't hear about that in the mainstream news, no.
[00:21:21.487 --> 00:21:26.811]  Brian Kemp declares state of emergency after anti-police Democrat riots in Georgia.
[00:21:26.811 --> 00:21:29.874]  Activates National Guard.
[00:21:29.874 --> 00:21:34.838]  Yeah, you don't hear about the radical Democrat terrorism that's been going on for a week now, do ya?
[00:21:34.838 --> 00:21:41.523]  Maybe that's why CNN is closing its Atlanta headquarters, because of the Democrat terrorists out there.
[00:21:42.608 --> 00:21:43.609]  No, you don't hear about that.
[00:21:43.609 --> 00:21:52.493]  You're still hearing about January 6th and people who walked into the Capitol and walked out and didn't even touch anything getting months in prison.
[00:21:52.493 --> 00:21:59.876]  Veterans, Marines, teachers, priests, doctors, grandmothers.
[00:21:59.876 --> 00:22:01.297]  Our wicked, evil government.
[00:22:01.297 --> 00:22:10.762]  Our disgusting, demonic, diabolical, hate-filled, alien, satanic government.
[00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:16.043]  That wants to get us into World War 3 now with Russia.
[00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:21.228]  And then they just put, they just want you to know about their symbolism and they just put blatant demonic symbolism up.
[00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:28.302]  Golden Demon statue placed atop New York Courthouse to honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg and abortion.
[00:22:28.302 --> 00:22:31.184]  Oh, and once again, liberals don't even know their own issues.
[00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:34.426]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was anti-Roe vs. Wade.
[00:22:34.426 --> 00:22:40.569]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg on multiple occasions said Roe vs. Wade should be overturned.
[00:22:40.569 --> 00:22:43.631]  I guess you leftists don't even know your own history.
[00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:48.214]  I guess you leftists don't even know the facts about your own idols.
[00:22:49.164 --> 00:23:02.005]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was against the Roe vs. Wade decision, set it on record multiple times, and I don't think that she would like having a statue in her honor made out looking like a femme demon.
[00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:06.272]  And now she's associated with baby murder.
[00:23:06.272 --> 00:23:12.374]  Yeah, I don't think that's how Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted to go out, but now you've stolen Ruth Bader Ginsburg's identity.
[00:23:12.374 --> 00:23:21.037]  Now you've stolen the lifetime achievements of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and you're now using it for your own political propaganda.
[00:23:21.037 --> 00:23:25.379]  Why am I not surprised?
[00:23:25.379 --> 00:23:28.780]  Of course, this being revealed two weeks after the
[00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:33.290]  Phallus statue, they revealed.
[00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.113]  A nice big statue of a penis, they revealed.
[00:23:37.113 --> 00:23:39.455]  They really get art, don't they?
[00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:40.797]  They really get art.
[00:23:40.797 --> 00:23:42.779]  Oh, here's a penis to honor Martin Luther King.
[00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:43.940]  Oh, nice!
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:51.386]  Hey, here's a golden demagogue, female goddess, demon, to honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg in abortion.
[00:23:51.386 --> 00:23:53.268]  Oh!
[00:23:53.268 --> 00:23:55.710]  But hey, I guess at the end of the day, those are just clumps of metal, right?
[00:23:56.854 --> 00:23:58.675]  Till they put it into your skin.
[00:23:58.675 --> 00:24:04.438]  New York to hire a chief customer experience officer to oversee digital ID plans.
[00:24:04.438 --> 00:24:05.999]  But this is just me going into the headlines.
[00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:10.221]  So.
[00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:11.162]  It's just unbelievable stuff.
[00:24:11.162 --> 00:24:13.463]  I'm going to get into the headlines when it comes to Ukraine and Russia.
[00:24:13.463 --> 00:24:16.504]  I'm going to get into the headlines when it comes to the latest with the Biden corruption.
[00:24:16.504 --> 00:24:23.168]  We're going to play more of the video clips from the bombshell Project Veritas reports.
[00:24:23.168 --> 00:24:23.788]  Videos.
[00:24:29.397 --> 00:24:36.904]  But I'll finish it where I left off, cut off by the break in the last segment.
[00:24:36.904 --> 00:24:42.309]  Who is going to carry this torch forward?
[00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:44.091]  You can only do so much in the media, folks.
[00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:45.933]  I don't have subpoena power.
[00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:48.235]  I don't have investigative power.
[00:24:48.235 --> 00:24:49.416]  I can't indict people.
[00:24:49.416 --> 00:24:50.817]  I can't arrest people.
[00:24:50.817 --> 00:24:51.718]  I'm not a judge.
[00:24:51.718 --> 00:24:52.419]  I'm not a jury.
[00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:53.540]  I'm not a lawyer.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.461]  I'm not a congressman.
[00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:06.535]  When will somebody take this torch and finally clean up some of this mess?
[00:25:06.535 --> 00:25:10.057]  Why is Pfizer not being raided and investigated?
[00:25:10.057 --> 00:25:19.423]  Why is Joe Biden not... I mean, I guess we know the answer why Biden is not being impeached, but where are the investigations?
[00:25:19.423 --> 00:25:20.804]  Maybe they're going on behind the scenes.
[00:25:20.804 --> 00:25:23.465]  I mean, we're getting some information, but this is just out of control.
[00:25:23.465 --> 00:25:25.887]  This guy's about to get us into World War III with Russia.
[00:25:25.887 --> 00:25:28.028]  You know, maybe it's time to do something about him.
[00:25:31.835 --> 00:25:33.616]  Oh, and now the U.S.
[00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:47.506]  dollar as the world reserve currency, and the currency used for oil purchases, that's all gone as well.
[00:25:47.506 --> 00:25:54.591]  Petrodollar on shaky ground, Saudi Arabia willing to discuss selling oil and other currencies, just like Russia.
[00:25:56.624 --> 00:25:59.246]  And your media has sold you out.
[00:25:59.246 --> 00:26:02.610]  And your politicians have sold you out.
[00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:09.736]  We here at InfoWars have been warning about this for a year.
[00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:10.337]  You know, I just...
[00:26:12.995 --> 00:26:34.663]  You know, I'm sorry that the people on television and in your local news are fat and happy and wealthy and so they don't care or they might not even understand how this country is collapsing right under their feet because they got nice fancy cars, nice fancy suits, and nice fancy houses, nice fancy vacations, so they don't really feel the pinch.
[00:26:34.663 --> 00:26:37.884]  They can come on and, hey, everything's fine, don't worry about it, America.
[00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:40.512]  No, not the case, actually.
[00:26:40.512 --> 00:26:44.253]  We are losing our ground in the international community.
[00:26:44.253 --> 00:26:50.056]  Our current White House, our current administration is a laughingstock of the planet.
[00:26:50.056 --> 00:26:53.718]  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are a joke.
[00:26:53.718 --> 00:26:55.418]  They are a joke.
[00:26:55.418 --> 00:26:58.200]  Nobody respects them.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.980]  Nobody.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.182]  And how do you think that's going to go when Biden gets us into World War III?
[00:27:04.182 --> 00:27:05.243]  Do you really think
[00:27:06.488 --> 00:27:09.410]  The world community is going to side with Joe Biden.
[00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:14.954]  Are you out of your minds?
[00:27:14.954 --> 00:27:22.400]  But see, there's your fat cats in the American media with their million dollar contracts, their million dollar homes, their million dollars worth of vehicles.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.002]  They don't give a damn about you.
[00:27:25.002 --> 00:27:28.325]  So they're not going to tell you how Joe Biden is ruining your life.
[00:27:28.325 --> 00:27:31.147]  They're not going to tell you how Joe Biden is destroying your future.
[00:27:31.147 --> 00:27:33.809]  They're not going to tell you how Pfizer's vaccines are killing you.
[00:27:35.179 --> 00:27:36.300]  They're not interested in that.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:42.183]  They don't want to stop that gravy train from coming in.
[00:27:42.183 --> 00:27:47.827]  Big vote today for the RNC chair.
[00:27:47.827 --> 00:27:49.988]  We'll be monitoring that.
[00:27:49.988 --> 00:27:55.312]  The Paul Pelosi police body cam footage has just dropped.
[00:27:55.312 --> 00:27:56.413]  I mean, like, I just...
[00:27:57.546 --> 00:28:08.651]  I don't know how we're going to cover it all today, folks, especially with the guests, and then the War Room is the veteran call-in show, so it's all of this important news, but we've got so many guests and other things to do, I don't even know how we're going to cover it, but it's all out there.
[00:28:09.761 --> 00:28:13.944]  And we're going to try our best to cover it here today, so I don't know where we'll go when we come out.
[00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:23.550]  Probably get into this Pfizer stuff, but big news out of Ukraine, big news from the Pfizer executives telling the truth and claiming they're lying.
[00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.472]  By the way, we know he's lying about that.
[00:28:25.472 --> 00:28:27.313]  I'll explain that as well.
[00:28:27.313 --> 00:28:28.273]  Oh, I'm just a liar.
[00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:29.935]  Well, yeah, you're lying about that, too.
[00:28:29.935 --> 00:28:31.716]  You are a liar, but you were being honest there.
[00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:35.753]  And then, uh, so here we go.
[00:28:35.753 --> 00:28:37.014]  Here's the body cam footage.
[00:28:37.014 --> 00:28:38.835]  You're seeing it on the screen right now.
[00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:41.157]  Oh, that's cute.
[00:28:41.157 --> 00:28:41.978]  My goodness.
[00:28:41.978 --> 00:28:43.599]  Oh, the American media lied again?
[00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.581]  Oh, the Democrat Party lied again?
[00:28:45.581 --> 00:28:46.962]  Oh, the Pelosi's lied again?
[00:28:46.962 --> 00:28:50.985]  It wasn't a conservative assault on the Pelosi's?
[00:28:50.985 --> 00:28:52.807]  Yeah, all they do is lie.
[00:28:52.807 --> 00:28:54.248]  Have you not figured that out yet?
[00:28:54.248 --> 00:28:54.769]  Of course you have.
[00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:56.230]  That's why you're tuned in to InfoWars.

[00:29:12.686 --> 00:29:14.446]  The information war.
[00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:16.427]  There's nothing you can do more important
[00:29:16.727 --> 00:29:17.468]  We're good to go!

[00:30:20.888 --> 00:30:26.351]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:29.052]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,

[00:30:31.733 --> 00:30:36.915]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[00:30:36.915 --> 00:30:39.276]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:43.057]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[00:30:43.057 --> 00:30:45.698]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[00:30:45.698 --> 00:30:51.820]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.

[00:30:56.181 --> 00:30:56.902]  A true 360 win.
[00:31:00.154 --> 00:31:07.839]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:09.900]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.601]  They know we're telling the truth.
[00:31:11.601 --> 00:31:13.162]  They know we've got their number.
[00:31:13.162 --> 00:31:17.885]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:20.487]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[00:31:21.027 --> 00:31:21.227]  Thank you.
[00:31:37.185 --> 00:31:42.169]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds.
[00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:12.395]  Famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[00:32:12.395 --> 00:32:16.418]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:32:16.418 --> 00:32:18.720]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.023]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[00:32:23.023 --> 00:32:25.586]  And because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:35.116]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:32:35.116 --> 00:32:40.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:32:41.283 --> 00:32:43.224]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:32:43.224 --> 00:32:50.509]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:51.909]  It is all in your hands.
[00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:53.250]  So thanks for your support.
[00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.451]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:32:54.451 --> 00:32:57.733]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:32:57.733 --> 00:33:01.335]  It's up to you.
[00:33:01.335 --> 00:33:07.239]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.663 --> 00:33:19.168]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[00:33:19.168 --> 00:33:21.930]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:30.238]  Alright, we're gonna get into this Pfizer executive having a complete psychotic break.
[00:33:31.653 --> 00:33:33.154]  Confronted by Project Veritas.
[00:33:33.154 --> 00:33:33.975]  But of course!
[00:33:33.975 --> 00:33:37.298]  I mean, this is a guy who's in way over his head.
[00:33:37.298 --> 00:33:42.482]  He was hired probably because of affirmative action.
[00:33:42.482 --> 00:33:54.811]  And I think Pfizer, in their compartmentalization of all their activities, they want dumb people that kind of feel like, well, you know, do I really deserve this spot?
[00:33:54.811 --> 00:33:56.072]  Do I really deserve this paycheck?
[00:33:56.072 --> 00:33:57.674]  I better just shut up and do my job.
[00:33:58.979 --> 00:34:15.052]  And to me, that's my analysis of this Pfizer executive, Jordan Tristan Walker, is that probably an affirmative action hire, and they wanted somebody that wasn't, you know, the brightest or most stable individual.
[00:34:15.052 --> 00:34:16.614]  Clearly, the individual's not stable.
[00:34:16.614 --> 00:34:17.995]  I mean, that's undeniable.
[00:34:17.995 --> 00:34:19.296]  The guy's clearly unstable.
[00:34:20.888 --> 00:34:21.769]  And that's what they want.
[00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:24.130]  They want people that they know don't belong there.
[00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:25.712]  They want people that are not the smartest.
[00:34:25.712 --> 00:34:29.755]  They want people that will comply knowing they don't belong there.
[00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:35.699]  So that they can compartmentalize and keep somebody like this in the dark about what's really going on.
[00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:41.103]  But he obviously had enough information about what was going on to expose Pfizer.
[00:34:41.103 --> 00:34:44.646]  Know what they're doing is illegal and evil.
[00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:47.288]  You can hear it in the original report when he's on the date.
[00:34:50.084 --> 00:34:53.166]  And then, of course, has the psychotic break.
[00:34:53.166 --> 00:34:55.407]  So why would you have a psychotic break like that?
[00:34:55.407 --> 00:35:12.877]  Well, because you know what you were doing was probably illegal and evil, and you've just exposed the company, Pfizer, that you work for, and you know that this now is a genie being let out of the bottle, so you just have a complete psychotic break.
[00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:17.620]  Now, here's my further evidence of what I'm talking about here.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.240]  When Albert
[00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:23.029]  Was confronted by the rebel.
[00:35:23.029 --> 00:35:25.390]  Did he behave like this?
[00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.151]  Of course not!
[00:35:27.151 --> 00:35:31.412]  Albert Brüller is a stable psycho.
[00:35:31.412 --> 00:35:38.315]  Albert Brüller is a contemplated psychopath.
[00:35:38.315 --> 00:35:40.636]  Consciously doing evil.
[00:35:40.636 --> 00:35:44.237]  So he is not having the psychotic breaks when he's confronted.
[00:35:44.237 --> 00:35:48.019]  He knows what he's doing and he is stable enough
[00:35:49.571 --> 00:35:54.515]  To like what he's doing and know not to have a complete psychotic break when confronted about it.
[00:35:54.515 --> 00:36:11.410]  But this individual, who clearly probably did not even belong in the position he had, affirmative action hire, hired as a low IQ moron to be part of the compartmentalization at Pfizer, and now that he's exposed the whole thing, he has a psychotic break while he's confronted.
[00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:13.232]  Now, I'm gonna cover some headlines here.
[00:36:14.557 --> 00:36:21.800]  And let me just explain one thing about this video, though, folks, that's important before we get back to it, so you have some context when we roll it.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:29.122]  The original, and I, look, I did not mean to let the cat out of the bag.
[00:36:29.122 --> 00:36:32.404]  We love our friends over at Project Veritas.
[00:36:32.404 --> 00:36:35.845]  They did not tell me that this was a Grindr date.
[00:36:35.845 --> 00:36:40.507]  I assumed that and reported that.
[00:36:40.507 --> 00:36:44.168]  But, well, it was a Grindr date.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.561]  I didn't get that from Project Veritas.
[00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:55.244]  That was my assumption, just with enough circumstantial evidence, we'll say, and background information.
[00:36:55.244 --> 00:37:03.548]  But here's what's important to try to wrap our heads around, and there's going to be more videos coming.
[00:37:03.548 --> 00:37:12.432]  The video that we're going to show of him having the psychotic break when confronted by James O'Keefe is from Tuesday night.
[00:37:12.432 --> 00:37:13.233]  Tuesday night.
[00:37:14.127 --> 00:37:15.988]  Now why am I telling you this?
[00:37:15.988 --> 00:37:25.135]  Because the first video of him on the Grindr dates, the Pfizer executive on the Grindr dates, that came out Wednesday night.
[00:37:25.135 --> 00:37:39.126]  So that means on Tuesday night, when James O'Keefe confronted Jordan Tristan Walker, the first video had never been released.
[00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:40.767]  Are you picking up what I'm putting down yet?
[00:37:41.411 --> 00:37:45.852]  How did Walker know about the Project Veritas video?
[00:37:45.852 --> 00:37:48.693]  How did Walker know about James O'Keefe?
[00:37:48.693 --> 00:37:52.574]  How did Walker know he was recorded on undercover video?
[00:37:52.574 --> 00:37:56.675]  And who coached Walker to come out and say, I'm just a liar!
[00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:58.336]  Literally, I'm just a liar!
[00:37:58.336 --> 00:38:00.716]  I'm just a liar!
[00:38:00.716 --> 00:38:02.457]  Who coached him to say that?
[00:38:02.457 --> 00:38:10.559]  This was all coached, this was all discussed by Walker and Pfizer before any of this footage came out.
[00:38:12.062 --> 00:38:13.763]  Are you picking up what I'm putting down?
[00:38:13.763 --> 00:38:14.944]  And I'm not trying to be funny.
[00:38:14.944 --> 00:38:15.624]  I'm actually asking.
[00:38:15.624 --> 00:38:16.645]  I'll ask my camera guy.
[00:38:16.645 --> 00:38:18.266]  Do you understand what I'm saying here?
[00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:22.969]  Because I was explaining this to some people last night that called me and were like, hey, how do you know so much about this?
[00:38:22.969 --> 00:38:24.390]  What do you know?
[00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.811]  Thank you.
[00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:25.871]  And I was trying to explain to them.
[00:38:25.871 --> 00:38:27.292]  I was like, no, no, no.
[00:38:27.292 --> 00:38:29.574]  The video was released Wednesday.
[00:38:29.574 --> 00:38:31.175]  He freaked out on Tuesday.
[00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:32.376]  He knew this was coming.
[00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:33.236]  They knew this was coming.
[00:38:33.236 --> 00:38:34.297]  He was coached.
[00:38:34.297 --> 00:38:35.578]  And I was talking to some people last night.
[00:38:35.578 --> 00:38:36.338]  They were like, I don't get it.
[00:38:36.338 --> 00:38:37.119]  What are you saying?
[00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:37.959]  I don't get it.
[00:38:37.959 --> 00:38:38.480]  So I'm trying.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.981]  I'm really trying to see if you understand.
[00:38:41.178 --> 00:38:49.500]  Walker was clearly coached before any of the videos came out to say, oh, I'm just a liar.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.640]  So how did he know the videos were coming out?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.921]  And who coached him to say, I'm just a liar.
[00:38:54.921 --> 00:38:57.341]  I'm just a liar.
[00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:57.802]  Nice.
[00:38:57.802 --> 00:39:00.002]  Nice admission, bro.
[00:39:00.002 --> 00:39:00.942]  Oh, you're a liar.
[00:39:00.942 --> 00:39:01.562]  Well, exactly.
[00:39:01.562 --> 00:39:02.382]  We know you're a liar.
[00:39:02.382 --> 00:39:05.403]  So we're not going to trust you now either.
[00:39:05.403 --> 00:39:09.384]  And, you know, I'll just say this before I get into the headlines and we're going to roll the entire video in the next segment.
[00:39:12.674 --> 00:39:16.876]  You know, Jordan, you might not be a bad person.
[00:39:16.876 --> 00:39:31.925]  You might have done some bad things and you might have worked for an evil company, but I'm going to give you some free advice because clearly you're not smart enough to think of this yourself and you're not being influenced by the right people.
[00:39:31.925 --> 00:39:36.768]  Jordan, you've got a window of time here to do the right thing.
[00:39:36.768 --> 00:39:42.191]  And if you do want to save yourself, you need to come out and become a Pfizer whistleblower.
[00:39:43.649 --> 00:39:50.294]  Because if you try to protect Pfizer, and if you trust Pfizer is going to protect you, you're done, buddy.
[00:39:50.294 --> 00:39:51.856]  You're done.
[00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:52.596]  You're done.
[00:39:52.596 --> 00:39:54.317]  There is no hope for you.
[00:39:54.317 --> 00:40:02.824]  The only hope you have to redeem yourself is to come out as a Pfizer whistleblower.
[00:40:02.824 --> 00:40:10.010]  And if you really think you can trust Pfizer to protect you and have your back when this is all going down, you're dumber than I thought.
[00:40:11.758 --> 00:40:16.801]  So, Jordan, come to the good side, do the right thing.
[00:40:16.801 --> 00:40:18.643]  I do believe you are a real person.
[00:40:18.643 --> 00:40:22.105]  I do believe that you might not even be a bad guy.
[00:40:22.105 --> 00:40:28.269]  But you now have the fork in the road of your life ahead of you.
[00:40:28.269 --> 00:40:31.892]  And the decision you make at this fork will determine the rest of your life.
[00:40:31.892 --> 00:40:36.094]  If you go down the road of Pfizer, that's it for you.
[00:40:36.094 --> 00:40:37.636]  Pfizer's fate will be your fate.
[00:40:38.676 --> 00:40:43.577]  And if you think you can trust Pfizer with your fate, then you're even dumber than I thought.
[00:40:43.577 --> 00:40:50.459]  Or you can become a Pfizer whistleblower and do the right thing and salvage your future.
[00:40:50.459 --> 00:40:52.560]  But so, this is what they do.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.921]  Now, this was a syndicated headline all over the media.
[00:40:57.136 --> 00:41:05.124]  Last night and today, on Trump's social network, ads for miracle cures, scams, and fake merchandise.
[00:41:05.124 --> 00:41:07.407]  So, oh, oh, oh!
[00:41:07.407 --> 00:41:11.811]  On Truth Social, people are selling stuff and they say it's fake and all these scams.
[00:41:11.811 --> 00:41:14.815]  Oh, okay, well, now do the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:41:14.815 --> 00:41:15.896]  What do you call that?
[00:41:15.896 --> 00:41:16.837]  Was that a scam?
[00:41:16.837 --> 00:41:18.298]  Was that fake?
[00:41:18.298 --> 00:41:19.680]  Was that a fake miracle cure?
[00:41:20.765 --> 00:41:21.847]  That's exactly what it was.
[00:41:21.847 --> 00:41:23.269]  What about FTX?
[00:41:23.269 --> 00:41:26.876]  What about that giant scam with FTX that they're covering up right now?
[00:41:26.876 --> 00:41:27.797]  I've got news on that.
[00:41:27.797 --> 00:41:28.779]  They're covering the whole thing up.
[00:41:28.779 --> 00:41:29.480]  Was that a scam?
[00:41:32.398 --> 00:41:36.559]  What about that lady that sold the fake cancer screenings that got investigated?
[00:41:36.559 --> 00:41:41.981]  That all the big leftist networks got behind and promoted and she went down as a scam artist.
[00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:42.661]  Was that a scam?
[00:41:42.661 --> 00:41:43.682]  Was that fake merchandise?
[00:41:43.682 --> 00:41:45.542]  Was that a miracle cure?
[00:41:45.542 --> 00:41:46.443]  Yes, it was.
[00:41:46.443 --> 00:41:54.205]  But see, when they promote the fake scams, when they promote the miracle cures, when they promote the fake merchandise, it's all fine!
[00:41:54.205 --> 00:41:56.406]  Oh, they can do FTX scams all day long!
[00:41:57.537 --> 00:42:09.525]  They can do COVID-19 vaccine scams all day long, but you do a funny marketing thing on Truth Social with a $1,000 gold Trump bill as a joke.
[00:42:09.525 --> 00:42:11.366]  They say, this is fake.
[00:42:11.366 --> 00:42:12.607]  This is a scam.
[00:42:12.607 --> 00:42:14.968]  Look out for Truth Social scams.
[00:42:14.968 --> 00:42:16.449]  Oh, but you promote FTX.
[00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:17.930]  I got it.
[00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:18.311]  I got it.
[00:42:18.311 --> 00:42:19.892]  You promote Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:42:19.892 --> 00:42:22.874]  You tell us Joe Biden has his mental faculties together.
[00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:24.635]  I see.
[00:42:24.635 --> 00:42:25.295]  I see.
[00:42:25.295 --> 00:42:25.936]  But what about this?
[00:42:26.966 --> 00:42:32.208]  Getting Pfizer's COVID booster and flu shot on the same day may raise risk of a stroke.
[00:42:32.208 --> 00:42:32.788]  Daily Mail.
[00:42:32.788 --> 00:42:33.209]  Oh, really?
[00:42:33.209 --> 00:42:34.789]  You don't say?
[00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:39.551]  Deaths running at a 26% above pre-pandemic levels.
[00:42:39.551 --> 00:42:42.392]  Yeah, the vaccines are causing the death rates to rise.
[00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:43.013]  Not COVID.
[00:42:43.013 --> 00:42:44.053]  COVID never did.
[00:42:44.053 --> 00:42:46.434]  The vaccines are surely doing that.
[00:42:46.434 --> 00:42:51.356]  Another former National League football player nearly died from a stroke.
[00:42:51.356 --> 00:42:54.277]  Spain's under-15 football star dies suddenly.
[00:42:54.277 --> 00:42:55.758]  I got stats of this news here.
[00:43:00.026 --> 00:43:04.748]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:09.950]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.812]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[00:43:14.812 --> 00:43:19.734]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[00:43:19.734 --> 00:43:28.778]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:41.634]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series from Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[00:43:41.634 --> 00:43:45.980]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[00:43:47.702 --> 00:43:48.222]  300%.
[00:43:48.222 --> 00:43:50.745]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[00:43:50.745 --> 00:43:55.249]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on WhatCoinsRemain.
[00:43:55.249 --> 00:43:56.790]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[00:43:59.921 --> 00:44:03.285]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[00:44:03.285 --> 00:44:06.088]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:44:06.088 --> 00:44:08.812]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.113]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:44:10.113 --> 00:44:14.018]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:18.904]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:44:19.204 --> 00:44:25.388]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[00:44:25.388 --> 00:44:34.014]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:44:34.014 --> 00:44:39.698]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:44:39.698 --> 00:44:45.122]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot Video for granted.
[00:44:45.362 --> 00:44:47.845]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:44:47.845 --> 00:44:50.528]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:44:50.528 --> 00:44:52.010]  So go check out the store.
[00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.211]  Go support their store.
[00:44:53.211 --> 00:44:54.713]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:44:54.713 --> 00:44:56.075]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:44:56.075 --> 00:44:57.576]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.354]  It's been a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:45:06.354 --> 00:45:12.759]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:45:12.759 --> 00:45:17.884]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:45:17.884 --> 00:45:19.605]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:45:19.605 --> 00:45:26.031]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who supported Infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:45:26.751 --> 00:45:32.172]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:45:32.172 --> 00:45:36.493]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:45:36.493 --> 00:45:45.655]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:46.535]  God bless you all.
[00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:48.116]  I salute you.
[00:45:48.116 --> 00:45:48.876]  I thank you.
[00:45:48.876 --> 00:45:54.557]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:45:55.258 --> 00:45:56.565]  The fight is my fight.
[00:45:56.565 --> 00:45:57.209]  It's your fight.
[00:45:57.209 --> 00:45:57.953]  It's our fight.
[00:45:57.953 --> 00:45:58.737]  God bless you all.
[00:45:59.986 --> 00:46:03.228]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[00:46:03.228 --> 00:46:19.520]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.825]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:46:26.385 --> 00:46:28.947]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[00:46:28.947 --> 00:46:32.889]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[00:46:32.889 --> 00:46:37.392]  You'll get them at InfoWarsStore.com under our exclusive label.
[00:46:37.392 --> 00:46:43.316]  We're bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory, right here in the USA, to your door.
[00:46:43.316 --> 00:46:49.180]  It'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system, and it keeps InfoWars Store on the air.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:54.664]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com with
[00:46:54.924 --> 00:46:56.166]  Massive, massive savings.
[00:47:21.408 --> 00:47:24.250]  Look folks, I understand the frustration as much as you.
[00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:30.574]  The fact that Pfizer is not being investigated, raided, shut down, products recalled after all of this.
[00:47:30.574 --> 00:47:39.280]  But, that's just because our media is corrupt, that's just because our government is corrupt, our law enforcement, our justice system is corrupt, we know this.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.763]  But still, this cat's out of the bag, this genie's out of the bottle, there's no saving Pfizer now.
[00:47:44.844 --> 00:48:04.897]  Any human being on this planet, any American that has any common sense, any logic, reasoning combined with just a tiny bit of thirst and interest in information and news is now never going to look at a Pfizer product the same way, never going to see a Pfizer ad the same way.
[00:48:04.897 --> 00:48:06.418]  It's done.
[00:48:06.418 --> 00:48:12.623]  And now our government and our media will be further exposed as how corrupt it is for not doing anything about it.
[00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:14.384]  Now, before I play this video, folks, look,
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.904]  You know the situation, InfoWars is in here, and thanks to your support, we're still on the air.
[00:48:20.904 --> 00:48:30.032]  The problem that I face here, and it's a heavy burden, it's a heavy weight to lift, I have no problem trying to lift it myself, but it's not me, it's you.
[00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:31.153]  I need your help.
[00:48:31.153 --> 00:48:34.495]  When Alex is gone, funding just falls off the table, folks.
[00:48:34.495 --> 00:48:36.277]  I'm just going to tell you like it is.
[00:48:36.277 --> 00:48:40.080]  People tune into the Alex Jones Show, they hear Owen Schroer, most of them just tune right out.
[00:48:41.147 --> 00:48:41.507]  I get it.
[00:48:41.507 --> 00:48:43.829]  You tuned in to hear Alex, not Owen.
[00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:48.751]  So, when Alex takes off and Owen fills in, the funding goes down dramatically.
[00:48:48.751 --> 00:48:50.512]  So, help me out here.
[00:48:50.512 --> 00:48:51.593]  Do some heavy lifting.
[00:48:51.593 --> 00:48:54.014]  Let's shop at Infowarsstore.com today.
[00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:56.616]  Let's make a donation at Infowarsstore.com today.
[00:48:56.616 --> 00:49:01.859]  Now, actually, I've got some exclusive news because to try to help this effort,
[00:49:03.419 --> 00:49:13.066]  I went to our team that kind of does the marketing and the product stuff, and I said, hey, I know when Alex goes that the funding goes way down.
[00:49:13.066 --> 00:49:14.828]  What can I do to try to mitigate that?
[00:49:14.828 --> 00:49:17.429]  And so we were discussing some different things.
[00:49:17.429 --> 00:49:18.610]  And so what we're going to do is...
[00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:33.357]  He said, well, why don't we just do a special for you, and while Alex is gone, you can have an exclusive coupon code to give people a discount, and maybe that will drive people to the store, and we can mitigate some of the losses when Alex is gone.
[00:49:33.357 --> 00:49:39.479]  So, you saw it on the screen, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, 25% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:50:41.027 --> 00:50:41.628]  Thank you.
[00:50:54.845 --> 00:50:58.667]  So they're admitting now that the Pfizer jabs are causing strokes and heart attacks.
[00:50:58.667 --> 00:50:59.788]  It's all mainstream news.
[00:50:59.788 --> 00:51:00.508]  The numbers are out.
[00:51:00.508 --> 00:51:01.229]  Everybody knows it.
[00:51:01.229 --> 00:51:02.509]  They're still pushing them.
[00:51:02.509 --> 00:51:07.292]  They're admitting now that the death rate has increased after COVID.
[00:51:07.292 --> 00:51:09.594]  There was no increase in the death rate during COVID.
[00:51:09.594 --> 00:51:16.117]  There's been a massive increase in the death rate post-COVID vaccines, and we all know what that is.
[00:51:16.117 --> 00:51:20.600]  More football players, former football players dying, having strokes.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.401]  The latest, Chris Baker,
[00:51:23.715 --> 00:51:28.618]  Former defensive tackle, 35-year-old, had a stroke.
[00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.919]  We had a story yesterday, a former linebacker dying suddenly.
[00:51:30.919 --> 00:51:33.841]  Spain's under-15 football star, Estrella Martin, dies suddenly.
[00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:36.783]  15-years-old, dies suddenly.
[00:51:36.783 --> 00:51:39.104]  Cardiac events everywhere.
[00:51:39.104 --> 00:51:43.987]  Tributes paid to kind and caring Cheshire woman, 19-years-old, dies suddenly.
[00:51:43.987 --> 00:51:44.968]  Dies suddenly.
[00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:50.331]  Sopranos actor, John Vitamiglia's daughter, Odell, dead at 25, dies suddenly.
[00:51:53.393 --> 00:51:55.734]  So, I mean, these things are just in the news every day.
[00:51:55.734 --> 00:51:56.394]  Never saw them before.
[00:51:56.394 --> 00:52:02.476]  I've been in news for more than 10 years now, hard to believe, but I've been on air reading news more than 10 years.
[00:52:02.476 --> 00:52:06.517]  Never seen died suddenly, never seen young athletes, all of this happening all at once.
[00:52:06.517 --> 00:52:09.998]  And these are just people we know because they're athletes, they're in the spotlight.
[00:52:09.998 --> 00:52:17.381]  Imagine just, you know, the average Joes out there, the guys working normal 9-to-5s or whatever, and they don't get the press attention, they're dying too.
[00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:22.864]  And right there at the heart of it, no pun intended, is Pfizer.
[00:52:22.864 --> 00:52:25.906]  So, here is the recent Project Veritas video.
[00:52:25.906 --> 00:52:29.509]  The Pfizer executive has a complete breakdown.
[00:52:29.509 --> 00:52:34.072]  Even after he's been coached by Pfizer that this is about to come, here's how to handle it.
[00:52:34.072 --> 00:52:35.193]  Still can't.
[00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:37.895]  This deranged lunatic has a complete breakdown.
[00:52:37.895 --> 00:52:41.137]  I've explained what his potential salvation could be here.
[00:52:41.137 --> 00:52:42.639]  He's probably not smart enough to do it.
[00:52:42.639 --> 00:52:44.180]  Here's the latest Project Veritas video.
[00:52:45.442 --> 00:52:46.262]  Hey there.
[00:52:46.262 --> 00:52:46.903]  Is this seat taken?
[00:52:46.903 --> 00:52:48.544]  You work for Pfizer.
[00:52:48.544 --> 00:52:55.207]  My question for you is, why does Pfizer want to hide from the public the fact that they're mutating the COVID viruses?
[00:52:55.207 --> 00:52:56.347]  Is this real life?
[00:52:56.347 --> 00:52:58.408]  I'm literally a liar.
[00:52:58.408 --> 00:53:00.549]  I was trying to impress a person on a date.
[00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:02.150]  You're lying.
[00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.071]  This is absurd.
[00:53:03.071 --> 00:53:04.451]  Please don't touch me.
[00:53:04.451 --> 00:53:05.772]  Why are you doing this?
[00:53:05.772 --> 00:53:07.013]  Don't tell anybody.
[00:53:07.013 --> 00:53:07.633]  Imagine that.
[00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:12.074]  I'm literally just a liar!
[00:53:12.074 --> 00:53:12.795]  I'm a liar!
[00:53:12.795 --> 00:53:13.735]  I'm just a liar!
[00:53:13.735 --> 00:53:15.635]  Imagine, that's your out!
[00:53:15.635 --> 00:53:17.736]  Like, that's how bad it is that your out is, I'm just a liar!
[00:53:17.736 --> 00:53:18.076]  I mean, wow!

[00:53:42.483 --> 00:53:44.585]  By the way, folks, more videos are coming.
[00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:48.228]  What's going on here?
[00:53:48.228 --> 00:53:50.610]  That feels like an interview.
[00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.351]  I don't know.
[00:53:52.351 --> 00:54:05.803]  It's like a flashback to that Steam organization of those conservative people who randomly go into organizations and then befriend people who work in these organizations and then report them, which happened to people at Pfizer.
[00:54:05.803 --> 00:54:09.646]  So it freaks me out when people start asking a lot of questions about what's going on.
[00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:09.866]  Really?
[00:54:09.866 --> 00:54:10.567]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.031]  We don't like being asked questions.
[00:54:16.031 --> 00:54:17.572]  You can't record us.
[00:54:17.572 --> 00:54:19.534]  Oh, we just we just mutate viruses.
[00:54:19.534 --> 00:54:21.275]  We just do gain-of-function research.
[00:54:21.275 --> 00:54:25.239]  We just give you deadly vaccines and deadly products and lie about them.
[00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:26.740]  But don't dare record me!
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.541]  I'm just a liar!
[00:54:29.861 --> 00:54:31.442]  Hi.
[00:54:31.442 --> 00:54:32.503]  You work for Pfizer.
[00:54:32.503 --> 00:54:39.210]  My question for you is, why does Pfizer want to hide from the public the fact that they're mutating the COVID viruses?
[00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.171]  Is this real life?
[00:54:40.171 --> 00:54:41.151]  What is happening?
[00:54:41.151 --> 00:54:42.373]  Oh, you know what's happening, bud.
[00:54:42.373 --> 00:54:43.394]  What is going on here?
[00:54:43.394 --> 00:54:44.314]  This is absurd.
[00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.436]  Why does Pfizer want to hide from the public?
[00:54:46.436 --> 00:54:49.799]  You're a demented lunatic that works for a demonic corporation.
[00:54:49.799 --> 00:54:51.461]  That's what's going on here, and you've been caught.
[00:54:51.461 --> 00:54:52.021]  You know it.
[00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:52.522]  You're on video.
[00:54:53.042 --> 00:54:55.604]  And your only defense is that you're a liar.
[00:54:55.604 --> 00:54:55.684]  Ha!
[00:54:55.684 --> 00:54:56.845]  Imagine that as a defense.
[00:54:56.845 --> 00:54:57.445]  Oh, you'll love it.
[00:54:57.445 --> 00:54:59.006]  I need to call the police right now.
[00:54:59.006 --> 00:55:01.387]  This is my restaurant.
[00:55:01.387 --> 00:55:02.948]  I don't know what's going on either.
[00:55:02.948 --> 00:55:04.049]  This is ridiculous.
[00:55:04.049 --> 00:55:05.550]  I have no idea what's going on.
[00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:06.630]  I don't know anything.
[00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.251]  I'm a journalist.
[00:55:07.251 --> 00:55:10.453]  Bro, first of all, I'm literally a liar.
[00:55:10.453 --> 00:55:11.193]  He's on video.
[00:55:11.193 --> 00:55:12.234]  I'm just a liar.
[00:55:12.234 --> 00:55:14.875]  You're saying we're exploring how the virus keeps mutating.
[00:55:14.875 --> 00:55:19.878]  One of the things we're exploring is why don't we mutate the virus?
[00:55:19.878 --> 00:55:22.500]  I don't know what's happening, but I really need the cops here right now.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:28.002]  So, please do... Please do call the police.
[00:55:28.002 --> 00:55:31.424]  Please do call the police.
[00:55:31.424 --> 00:55:36.546]  Please do.
[00:55:36.546 --> 00:55:39.347]  You're gonna call the police.
[00:55:39.347 --> 00:55:42.969]  He's gonna call the police for asking him a question.
[00:55:42.969 --> 00:55:44.430]  Please do call the police.
[00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:44.770]  Please do.
[00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:51.026]  He's, uh, on tape here talking about mutating the COVID virus.
[00:55:51.026 --> 00:55:51.766]  It's gain of function.
[00:55:51.766 --> 00:56:00.451]  Can I talk to you outside about this?
[00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:02.892]  Oh yeah, you're the one doing gain of function research.
[00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.413]  You're the one promoting deadly vaccines.
[00:56:04.413 --> 00:56:04.953]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:04.953 --> 00:56:06.194]  But, oh, Project Maritime.
[00:56:06.194 --> 00:56:06.894]  They're the bad guy.
[00:56:06.894 --> 00:56:07.234]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:07.234 --> 00:56:09.215]  I was trying to impress a person on a date.
[00:56:10.956 --> 00:56:16.778]  I was literally trying, I'm not even a scientist by background, you would know that I came from a consulting firm that does business.
[00:56:16.778 --> 00:56:17.358]  What are you then?
[00:56:17.358 --> 00:56:18.038]  This is absurd!
[00:56:18.038 --> 00:56:18.839]  Please don't touch me.
[00:56:18.839 --> 00:56:20.459]  This is absurd!
[00:56:20.459 --> 00:56:22.580]  Please do call the cops!
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.760]  Please do!
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.221]  Why would you call the cops if you have nothing to hide?
[00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:36.835]  So he's obviously having one of the most outrageous reactions I've ever seen in the history of Project Veritas.
[00:56:36.835 --> 00:56:39.877]  He's threatened to call the police.
[00:56:39.877 --> 00:56:41.258]  Okay, he grabbed the microphone.
[00:56:41.258 --> 00:56:43.039]  And the real psychotic break hasn't even happened yet.
[00:56:43.039 --> 00:56:44.981]  The question is, why is he calling the police?
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.943]  Do you want to put me in jail for asking you a question?
[00:56:59.943 --> 00:57:02.504]  What is the intention of calling the police?
[00:57:02.504 --> 00:57:05.527]  Can I talk to you please about this video?
[00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:14.057]  Okay, so there's one, two, three, four, five white people.
[00:57:24.992 --> 00:57:27.713]  This is why liberals love keeping racism alive.
[00:57:27.713 --> 00:57:33.776]  So when they get caught committing crimes, and they get caught in a situation, their out is racism.
[00:57:33.776 --> 00:57:34.796]  Oh, white people!
[00:57:34.796 --> 00:57:37.257]  It's all white people's fault!
[00:57:37.257 --> 00:57:43.860]  That's why they build all this stuff up, because they view it as an easy out, and they hope other liberals will just say, oh, it's white people?
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:49.602]  Oh, well, then this gay black man, he must be the good guy.
[00:57:49.602 --> 00:57:50.602]  Well, aren't they fantastic, Sam?
[00:57:52.543 --> 00:57:54.364]  Diet Force is amazing!
[00:57:54.364 --> 00:57:56.625]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:59.967]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[00:57:59.967 --> 00:58:04.110]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:08.913]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[00:58:08.913 --> 00:58:11.114]  Man, if you're struggling to get
[00:58:12.293 --> 00:58:14.574]  Like, chip shake for the ladies.
[00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:17.295]  Mate, DietForce is the go.
[00:58:17.295 --> 00:58:20.197]  You have to get the DietForce and have two a day.
[00:58:20.197 --> 00:58:21.958]  And just keep at it.
[00:58:21.958 --> 00:58:23.458]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:24.859]  X7 DietForce.

[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:28.481]  Now on sale.
[00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:29.361]  DietForce.
[00:58:29.361 --> 00:58:30.101]  We're cutting that ad.
[00:58:30.101 --> 00:58:31.362]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[00:58:31.362 --> 00:58:32.162]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:58:32.162 --> 00:58:34.183]  Thank you so much for the call, Grant.
[00:58:34.183 --> 00:58:35.724]  God bless Australia.
[00:58:35.724 --> 00:58:36.845]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:58:36.845 --> 00:58:37.465]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:58:37.465 --> 00:58:38.525]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:38.525 --> 00:58:39.166]  DietForce.
[00:58:39.166 --> 00:58:39.606]  Get it now.
[00:58:49.315 --> 00:58:56.880]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.501]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[00:58:58.501 --> 00:59:08.688]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts, whose information is beyond incredible.
[00:59:08.688 --> 00:59:14.392]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at Bandot Video.
[00:59:14.392 --> 00:59:16.614]  Millions of people a day, visiting Bandot Video.
[00:59:16.954 --> 00:59:26.539]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[00:59:26.539 --> 00:59:29.101]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:59:29.101 --> 00:59:32.243]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[00:59:32.243 --> 00:59:37.506]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[00:59:37.506 --> 00:59:44.910]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[00:59:51.368 --> 00:59:54.590]  So this is amazing.
[00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.391]  James O'Keefe confronting Jordan.
[01:00:13.078 --> 01:00:18.520]  From Pfizer, who's now massively viral thanks to last night's Project Veritas video.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:27.983]  Now the new one, O'Keefe confronting him at some cafe, and he is just going ballistic, losing his mind, and we pick it back up where we left off.
[01:00:33.124 --> 01:00:38.568]  Why would you bring race into this?
[01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:42.710]  We have you on tape talking about mutating the COVID virus.
[01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.391]  Pause this, this is hilarious.
[01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.593]  Pause it, pause it.
[01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.715]  Of course he goes for the racial angle.
[01:00:49.715 --> 01:00:55.358]  Look, do you see what a dishonest liar this person is?
[01:00:55.358 --> 01:00:58.060]  Let's just put some of the basics out here.
[01:00:59.218 --> 01:01:02.159]  This person is a dishonest liar.
[01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.519]  And so he calls the police.
[01:01:03.519 --> 01:01:04.699]  He says, I'm in danger.
[01:01:04.699 --> 01:01:05.540]  I'm in danger.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.360]  I'm surrounded by four white people.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.881]  Nobody's touching him.
[01:01:09.881 --> 01:01:11.661]  Nobody's surrounding him.
[01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:12.901]  Nobody's assaulting him.
[01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:15.482]  He's not at any physical risk.
[01:01:15.482 --> 01:01:17.482]  He's lying.
[01:01:17.482 --> 01:01:21.383]  So we're watching him lie in live time.
[01:01:21.383 --> 01:01:24.404]  It's like, hey, we're all in the room recording you right now.
[01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:26.605]  We're catching you lying about your situation.
[01:01:26.605 --> 01:01:28.045]  You sure you want to do this?
[01:01:29.292 --> 01:01:30.914]  So clearly, this guy's a liar.
[01:01:30.914 --> 01:01:34.097]  Now, was he lying about the gain-of-function research?
[01:01:34.097 --> 01:01:36.639]  Obviously, that's the story that they're going to go with.
[01:01:36.639 --> 01:01:40.763]  From my perspective, it appears that that's what he's been coached to do.
[01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:50.692]  And without going into too much information, let's just say that this isn't the first time Pfizer's been exposed by Project Veritas.
[01:01:50.692 --> 01:01:51.113]  And so,
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:02:00.324]  They may have had an idea that these videos were going to come out ahead of time and they prepared him for this.
[01:02:00.324 --> 01:02:06.367]  But what I can tell you, this video was shot Tuesday night in New York City.
[01:02:06.367 --> 01:02:07.728]  Just so you understand the timeline.
[01:02:07.728 --> 01:02:09.969]  This video was shot Tuesday night.
[01:02:09.969 --> 01:02:12.270]  That's all I can tell you right now.
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.251]  But the silence from Pfizer is obviously damning.
[01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:15.972]  They knew these videos were about to come out.
[01:02:17.285 --> 01:02:21.968]  And here's their guy, Tristan Walker, lying on camera.
[01:02:21.968 --> 01:02:27.011]  We're witnessing him lying on camera, freaking out because he's been caught and now he's being confronted again.
[01:02:27.011 --> 01:02:27.391]  Continue.
[01:02:29.836 --> 01:02:30.056]  Really?
[01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:30.196]  Really?
[01:03:00.635 --> 01:03:03.637]  No, that's not what normal men do.
[01:03:03.637 --> 01:03:07.460]  That's what scumbags like you do, punk.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.841]  Punk.
[01:03:08.841 --> 01:03:10.642]  Don't try to drag good men down.
[01:03:10.642 --> 01:03:13.044]  Don't try to drag gentlemen down.
[01:03:13.044 --> 01:03:14.565]  You're just a punk.
[01:03:14.565 --> 01:03:21.089]  You're just a lying punk that works for a satanic company and you've been caught.
[01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:28.595]  And now you're throwing an absolute fit, just like we would expect you to, as you're being exposed for what you really are.
[01:03:28.595 --> 01:03:29.015]  Continue.
[01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:32.745]  Do you, do you not work for Pfizer?
[01:03:32.745 --> 01:03:33.565]  Yes, I do!
[01:03:33.565 --> 01:03:34.906]  I thought he was the dean!
[01:03:34.906 --> 01:03:36.266]  Sir, do you not work for Pfizer?
[01:03:36.266 --> 01:03:38.147]  Do you work for- I'm part of the contractor!
[01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.348]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:41.188]  Do you currently work for Pfizer, yes or no?
[01:03:41.188 --> 01:03:42.489]  What are you talking about?
[01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.130]  Do you currently work for Pfizer, yes or no?
[01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.871]  What are you talking about here?
[01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:49.612]  Please, I want to talk to Peter.
[01:03:49.612 --> 01:03:52.713]  So you don't work for Pfizer?
[01:03:52.713 --> 01:03:54.894]  He doesn't want you to leave, ma'am.
[01:03:54.894 --> 01:03:57.635]  Oh, you can't do this to people!
[01:03:57.635 --> 01:03:59.336]  You can't do this to people!
[01:04:00.214 --> 01:04:00.834]  You!
[01:04:00.834 --> 01:04:04.457]  You work for a company that makes viruses in a lab!
[01:04:04.457 --> 01:04:10.120]  You work for a company that makes viruses so you can make vaccines and make billions of dollars!
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:16.244]  You work for a company that's already paid out the biggest medical malpractice lawsuits in all time!
[01:04:16.244 --> 01:04:22.008]  You work for a company whose products are known to kill hundreds of thousands of people!
[01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:27.071]  And you're gonna sit there and throw your arms in the air flamboyantly and say, You can't do this!
[01:04:27.071 --> 01:04:28.292]  You can't do this!
[01:04:29.514 --> 01:04:31.715]  You said you do gain-of-function research.
[01:04:31.715 --> 01:04:34.116]  You said you do directed evolution.
[01:04:34.116 --> 01:04:39.078]  You said you make viruses so you can sell vaccines to people as a cash cow.
[01:04:39.078 --> 01:04:43.719]  And now you're in a cafe throwing your arms in the air saying, you can't do this to me!
[01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:47.301]  Yeah, right, punk.
[01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:49.742]  Boy, I'll tell you, we thought you were bad before.
[01:04:49.742 --> 01:04:51.002]  You're even worse.
[01:04:51.002 --> 01:04:52.883]  This video makes you look even worse.
[01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.578]  I just want to say about diet force.
[01:05:02.578 --> 01:05:04.419]  Diet force is amazing!
[01:05:04.419 --> 01:05:10.022]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[01:05:10.022 --> 01:05:14.144]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:18.967]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[01:05:18.967 --> 01:05:21.168]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[01:05:22.347 --> 01:05:25.188]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.
[01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:27.348]  DietForce is the go.
[01:05:27.348 --> 01:05:30.249]  You have to get the DietForce and have two a day.
[01:05:30.249 --> 01:05:32.009]  And just keep active.

[01:06:08.036 --> 01:06:10.562]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:43.357 --> 01:06:50.444]  It's a story that we've talked about but it's not getting near enough attention and I think it's partly because...
[01:06:53.271 --> 01:07:03.854]  People were reporting on the consumer price index rising and the producer price index and the inflation that's been going on since Biden took office, but really that was the tip of the iceberg.
[01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:17.239]  Now we're actually starting to see the true economic devastation of Democrat Party politics, Joe Biden's policies, and so much more.
[01:07:18.627 --> 01:07:21.608]  And so it's really amazing to sit here and watch this.
[01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:22.808]  Oh, there's an egg shortage.
[01:07:22.808 --> 01:07:23.809]  Oh, egg prices are up.
[01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:24.809]  Your grocery bill is up.
[01:07:24.809 --> 01:07:25.669]  Your gas bill is up.
[01:07:25.669 --> 01:07:26.750]  Your electricity bill is up.
[01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:27.970]  It's all going up.
[01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:33.111]  The interest rates on your mortgage has more than doubled since Trump left office.
[01:07:33.111 --> 01:07:34.892]  And so there's all different examples of this.
[01:07:34.892 --> 01:07:39.473]  And joining me now to discuss it is Dave Krieger from CloudedTitles.com.
[01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.734]  I guess specifically, Dave,
[01:07:41.354 --> 01:07:51.056]  As far as the housing market is concerned, what are we seeing post-Biden, and how does the housing market reflect what's going on in the economy at large?
[01:07:52.133 --> 01:08:06.403]  Well, Owen, first off, I gotta say, it's great to be here, and congratulations on your rankings at number 11 in the latest listener poll that just came out with The War Room, and just wanna let you know, we're paying attention to what's going on over there.
[01:08:06.403 --> 01:08:09.766]  You know, that's really kind of you, I appreciate that.
[01:08:09.766 --> 01:08:12.248]  You struck a nerve with that one, I'm just gonna leave it be.
[01:08:13.328 --> 01:08:13.668]  Yeah.
[01:08:13.668 --> 01:08:14.009]  All right.
[01:08:14.009 --> 01:08:20.653]  Well, I mean, the thing is, is that, you know, we're looking at a serious foreclosure crisis now that is looming over America.
[01:08:20.653 --> 01:08:29.339]  And we basically, as you know, we have a pre-pandemic level measurement atom data, which we look at a lot.
[01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:33.843]  They supply RealtyTrack with a lot of this information.
[01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:40.948]  And RealtyTrack obviously monitors a lot of foreclosures for all the mainstream foreclosure mills and the back channel networks.
[01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:46.468]  And we're talking about networks like the NDEX, which nobody pays attention to.
[01:08:46.468 --> 01:08:50.591]  It's the nickname for the National Default Exchange.
[01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:57.976]  And they're a group of foreclosure mill law firms and servicers that are literally watching the country unfold.
[01:08:57.976 --> 01:09:00.838]  And I'm talking about all these mortgages and stuff.
[01:09:00.838 --> 01:09:03.981]  They continue to go out and securitize mortgages even after
[01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:07.932]  You know, the meltdown in 2008.
[01:09:07.932 --> 01:09:16.539]  We went through 2009 through 2016 where 97.5% of people vacated their homes when they were served with foreclosure notice.
[01:09:16.539 --> 01:09:18.781]  Didn't matter what state they were in.
[01:09:18.781 --> 01:09:21.703]  Florida and Texas and California.
[01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:29.025]  All the sand states, as a matter of fact, Arizona, Nevada, they were all involved in the seizure of all these properties.
[01:09:29.025 --> 01:09:31.067]  Well, here's something unique now.
[01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:45.896]  Right now in California, which is where I'm headed this afternoon, tomorrow we're going to be teaching an actual foreclosure relief defense workshop with Attorney Al West and myself and a former law professor who teaches bankruptcy.
[01:09:45.896 --> 01:09:50.699]  Because, as you know, the OCC, of course, they say that bankruptcy is a stall tactic.
[01:09:51.236 --> 01:09:53.993]  Well, you see, the thing is, is these attorneys, they're lying to you.
[01:09:54.528 --> 01:09:58.929]  When they tell you that, oh, you just need to wait and just wait for 90 days.
[01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:03.290]  And see, these are the foreclosure servicer employees telling you this, too.
[01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:11.351]  But they've been instructed to tell you by the banking cartels and the servicers that are handling all these real estate mortgage investment conduit mortgages.
[01:10:11.351 --> 01:10:21.333]  They're there to basically say, let's stall them and make them wait and don't make any payments for 90 days, because on day 91, all that insurance, the credit default swap, everything
[01:10:22.205 --> 01:10:38.529]  Kicks in, and these people literally, a $500,000 mortgage will net all of the players in the securitization market $7 million off of a $500,000 mortgage because it gets sold and resold and resold.
[01:10:38.529 --> 01:10:47.352]  And of course, way back when, when I was talking to Alex about the book-clotted titles, we were talking about an entity called MERS, Mortgage Electronic Registration System.
[01:10:47.352 --> 01:10:48.392]  Well, since I've been on the show,
[01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:58.190]  MERS and its parent, MERS Corp, were sold in October of 2018 to the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.
[01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:02.372]  And they are the same outfit that owns the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:11:02.372 --> 01:11:05.473]  What a merry bunch of bedfellows we have!
[01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:16.959]  And then on the outside, in the periphery, you've got Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, all operating shell corporations, and they're on the web saying, look, we have nothing to do, we're not stealing people's homes.
[01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:26.364]  Now they just let their shell corporations go in and bid $5,000 to $10,000 more than market value to get a hold of that house because they're going to turn us into a nation of renters.
[01:11:26.364 --> 01:11:27.705]  That's the intention.
[01:11:27.705 --> 01:11:29.986]  It's not ESG they're really after.
[01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:39.070]  They're after everybody who's got a mortgage property and as time goes on they're going to find reasons to put you in default.
[01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:40.391]  And you have to understand something.
[01:11:40.391 --> 01:11:43.833]  If MERS is listed on your mortgage or deed of trust document,
[01:11:45.265 --> 01:11:47.506]  Your loan has been securitized on Wall Street.
[01:11:47.506 --> 01:11:54.108]  You're in the secondary markets and some remit trust that was created in New York or Delaware owns your property.
[01:11:54.108 --> 01:12:02.710]  They're the ones who actually loaned you the money, not the corresponding letter that you met at the closing table when you got the keys to the house, because that's what people wanted.
[01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:05.531]  And they didn't care how screwed up their credit score was back then.
[01:12:05.531 --> 01:12:07.532]  Well, they kind of modified things around a little bit.
[01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:09.132]  So you got to work a little bit harder.
[01:12:09.132 --> 01:12:13.534]  And if you got 20 percent down, that's great, because now we have equity we can steal.
[01:12:13.534 --> 01:12:14.914]  And this is what the servicers are doing.
[01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:24.610]  And back in 2012, Owen, you probably remember that what they did was they signed an agreement with 49 states' Attorneys General, excepting Oklahoma.
[01:12:25.979 --> 01:12:35.768]  And they agreed in 2012, in February of 2012, which became effective a month later, that they weren't going to file any more of these nefarious documents in the land records.
[01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:42.134]  And as soon as the ink was dry, it's business as usual, they just went back and did everything they said they weren't going to do.
[01:12:42.134 --> 01:12:49.521]  And they still are to this day, because we conducted forensic examinations and audits in Williamson County, Texas and Osceola County, Florida.
[01:12:50.237 --> 01:13:06.614]  And of course, the proverbial caca hit the fan after those came out, and the banks literally in the Williamson County, Texas audit, when we got done there, we had a law firm of Bryce, Vander Linden, and Wernick actually disband and scatter because they were named in the report.
[01:13:07.114 --> 01:13:13.858]  And this is something that came straight out of my corporate attorney's mouth in Austin three weeks after that report was released.
[01:13:13.858 --> 01:13:20.403]  MERS published in the Austin American-Statesman a full-page ad rebutting the audit that we conducted.
[01:13:20.403 --> 01:13:28.748]  And eventually, Williamson County joined Travis and Nueces County and sued MERS and several banks in Nueces County, Texas.
[01:13:28.748 --> 01:13:32.670]  And of course, they lost that one because they have to prove damage.
[01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:35.192]  And see, most county recorders and clerks don't have the right
[01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:36.805]  To sue!
[01:13:36.805 --> 01:13:40.747]  That was proven in the case with Jeff Thigpen in Guilford County, North Carolina.
[01:13:40.747 --> 01:13:43.609]  Register of Deeds there, who I talked to on occasion.
[01:13:43.609 --> 01:13:46.890]  And the thing is, is I still am doing the foreclosure stuff.
[01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:50.272]  And with this workshop that came out, you know what's really crazy?
[01:13:50.272 --> 01:13:55.214]  We were putting out the word that we were going to be in L.A.
[01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:58.136]  And all of a sudden, I was getting back-channel communication, Owen.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.301]  I passed away.
[01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:06.086]  People were literally freaking out wondering where to send flowers and stuff because they heard I died.
[01:14:06.086 --> 01:14:13.792]  Who was putting this information out right before we're getting ready to launch a workshop to teach people how to fight the banks?
[01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:21.739]  99.9% of all REMIT foreclosures are illegal in the United States of America and they're continuing to do it and they're filing phony documents in the land records.
[01:14:21.739 --> 01:14:22.960]  I can't help stress enough.
[01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:29.043]  What has happened in the housing market, and this has been going on well before I was interested or paying attention, or even a homeowner myself.
[01:14:46.852 --> 01:14:54.177]  Buying a house for most people is probably the biggest purchase you're ever going to make, you know, just as far as financially and just as a life decision.
[01:14:54.177 --> 01:15:00.381]  And it's slowly but surely, generationally, it gets harder and harder and harder to do.
[01:15:00.381 --> 01:15:03.403]  And this is all by design so that you actually never own property.
[01:15:03.403 --> 01:15:06.865]  Essentially, you're an indentured servant to the banks or whoever has your mortgages.
[01:15:07.325 --> 01:15:11.389]  And as you were just explaining, Dave, they can come in and they'll try to take your property.
[01:15:11.389 --> 01:15:13.851]  And now I think that's actually the agenda.
[01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:19.896]  You know, even with some of the stuff that went down at Berkshire Hathaway over the years, I still think they were in the consumer market.
[01:15:19.896 --> 01:15:21.537]  They still wanted to buy and sell homes.
[01:15:21.537 --> 01:15:24.900]  But with BlackRock and Vanguard, it's like, no, they just want to own everything.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.283]  They want to price Americans out of the process altogether.
[01:15:28.283 --> 01:15:32.506]  And so I want to talk about that when we come back from the break, just kind of the overall story.
[01:15:32.506 --> 01:15:33.627]  And here's a headline from today.
[01:15:34.728 --> 01:15:40.951]  GDP report reveals second worst drop in real disposable income ever since 1932.
[01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:43.192]  So folks, how are you going to buy a house?
[01:15:43.192 --> 01:15:43.933]  Well, you're not.
[01:15:43.933 --> 01:15:47.415]  You're going to either try to rent one or you're just going to be a renter.
[01:15:47.415 --> 01:15:53.398]  And they even try to, even when the housing prices drop, they still rig the market by raising the interest rates.
[01:15:53.398 --> 01:15:54.959]  So we'll talk about that with Dave on the other side.
[01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:55.479]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:16:00.171 --> 01:16:03.313]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:16:03.313 --> 01:16:05.614]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:16:05.614 --> 01:16:09.557]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:16:09.557 --> 01:16:17.642]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:16:17.642 --> 01:16:26.287]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:16:27.296 --> 01:16:30.917]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:36.720]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.761]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:46.803]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:48.004]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:53.005]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[01:16:53.005 --> 01:16:57.947]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.228]  Please take action now.
[01:16:59.228 --> 01:17:03.009]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:16.219]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:17:16.219 --> 01:17:17.379]  These are high-end.
[01:17:17.379 --> 01:17:18.780]  These are the very best.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.262]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:21.783]  Well, guess what?
[01:17:21.783 --> 01:17:27.567]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:17:27.567 --> 01:17:29.549]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:37.051]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[01:17:37.051 --> 01:17:42.272]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:42.272 --> 01:17:52.315]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:17:52.315 --> 01:17:54.316]  InfoWars MD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:58.959 --> 01:18:01.141]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:02.942]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:18:02.942 --> 01:18:05.004]  This is an information war.
[01:18:05.004 --> 01:18:09.688]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:18:09.688 --> 01:18:16.174]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:18:16.634 --> 01:18:17.394]  We're good to go.
[01:18:38.203 --> 01:18:46.131]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[01:18:46.131 --> 01:18:48.453]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[01:18:48.453 --> 01:18:50.295]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:18:50.295 --> 01:18:51.436]  We're going over the top.
[01:18:51.436 --> 01:18:52.938]  But right now is a critical juncture.
[01:18:52.938 --> 01:18:55.961]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:03.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[01:19:03.699 --> 01:19:12.562]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[01:19:12.562 --> 01:19:17.644]  Down-and-out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast-acting, take it under the tongue.
[01:19:17.644 --> 01:19:25.906]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[01:19:25.906 --> 01:19:28.087]  All of these compounds are documented on record.
[01:19:28.527 --> 01:19:29.188]  We're good to go.
[01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:06.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:30.971 --> 01:20:38.990]  I want to talk into the subject of how the housing market has gotten so out of control.
[01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:52.593]  Where it used to be the average middle American family could afford a home or at least not be facing, you know, 30 years of paying half their paycheck to own a home.
[01:20:52.593 --> 01:21:05.423]  And of course, this has been slowly but surely used against the American people by the central banks and by these predatory real estate groups, which we're getting a better idea of now.
[01:21:05.423 --> 01:21:07.604]  And I kind of tie it all together with this headline from today.
[01:21:08.618 --> 01:21:14.300]  GDP report reveals second worst drop in real disposable income ever since 1932.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.621]  So less and less people are able to afford a house.
[01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:18.281]  The big banks love this.
[01:21:18.281 --> 01:21:28.085]  The big real estate companies love this because they can go in and buy them up at whatever price they want and then either sell them at a higher price or just rent them to you perpetually.
[01:21:29.265 --> 01:21:40.937]  And the banks like this because now they know they're dealing with people that have billions, if not trillions of dollars, instead of you, the average American, you know, working every day to try to pay off your mortgage.
[01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:46.622]  But you know what I saw recently, Dave, was this phenomenon, because there was a big housing boom during Trump.
[01:21:47.483 --> 01:21:54.469]  And people were buying and selling houses more than they had in recent history, and this caused a lot of prices to go up.
[01:21:54.469 --> 01:21:59.354]  A lot of housing prices went up, and homeowners felt good about that, and purchasers were okay with that.
[01:21:59.354 --> 01:22:00.615]  They had more disposable income.
[01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:04.310]  But now, obviously, in the Biden economy, not so good.
[01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:06.071]  Post-COVID, not so good.
[01:22:06.071 --> 01:22:07.391]  Housing prices drop again.
[01:22:07.391 --> 01:22:10.673]  And here's the big disturbance.
[01:22:10.673 --> 01:22:12.373]  People see this not knowing any better.
[01:22:12.373 --> 01:22:15.415]  And they say, oh, that house I was looking at that was $450,000 three years ago.
[01:22:15.415 --> 01:22:15.975]  Look at this.
[01:22:15.975 --> 01:22:16.455]  It's down to $350,000.
[01:22:16.455 --> 01:22:17.516]  Maybe now's a good time.
[01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:17.676]  Oh, oops.
[01:22:21.357 --> 01:22:28.483]  Except the interest rate, which was, let's say you got your house at $450,000 at a 2.7% interest rate.
[01:22:28.483 --> 01:22:33.608]  Well, okay, now it's $350,000, but now you're at a 7.5% interest rate.
[01:22:33.608 --> 01:22:35.369]  So the banks are still getting their money.
[01:22:35.369 --> 01:22:38.992]  They're still getting their money for a $450,000 house.
[01:22:38.992 --> 01:22:42.635]  You just don't see it because it's all in the fine print, it's all in the numbers.
[01:22:44.813 --> 01:22:53.615]  How can Americans understand this market better on top of not just knowing what to do to protect their property, but what is the overall story?
[01:22:53.615 --> 01:23:05.538]  How has this been done where Americans, with the highest standard of living and the greatest economy on planet Earth in recent history, and most people can't even really afford to own a home?
[01:23:05.538 --> 01:23:06.478]  That's easy to answer.
[01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:11.652]  It's called, We Have a Plandemic, and that was all part of the big takedown.
[01:23:11.652 --> 01:23:15.334]  Because look what happened, Owen, when the plandemic hit.
[01:23:15.334 --> 01:23:20.716]  And I call it a plandemic, and obviously, I mean, thank you for running the Pfizer video, we appreciate that.
[01:23:20.716 --> 01:23:22.197]  I even, when I saw it, I go,
[01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:23.617]  Where did they record this?
[01:23:23.617 --> 01:23:24.298]  In New York?
[01:23:24.298 --> 01:23:25.158]  Oh, well, no wonder.
[01:23:25.158 --> 01:23:27.159]  It's a one-party consent state.
[01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:33.621]  That means you're legally allowed to record a conversation if you're a contributor or, you know, part of the interview.
[01:23:33.621 --> 01:23:37.382]  You can record without their consent or even their knowledge and get away with it.
[01:23:37.382 --> 01:23:40.203]  So there is nothing that that wimp can do.
[01:23:40.203 --> 01:23:41.624]  And I'm glad you played the video.
[01:23:41.624 --> 01:23:50.967]  See, that's all leading up to the bigger game plan here, because Big Pharma and medical tyranny, and we're talking Moderna, we're talking J&J, we're talking all of them.
[01:23:51.508 --> 01:23:52.589]  I mean, they're all in on it.
[01:23:52.589 --> 01:24:03.636]  And the thing is, is the fear-mongering that was going on, and then Congress going out, when Biden came in, the first thing he did was wreck the economy with 44 different executive orders.
[01:24:03.636 --> 01:24:12.061]  Shutting down Keystone, driving energy prices up, and then Congress, under Democratic control, turned around and started spending money like whores.
[01:24:13.138 --> 01:24:18.180]  And literally drove because of all the excess borrowing they were doing from the Fed.
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:22.402]  The Fed had to raise interest rates to try to control inflation and that didn't work.
[01:24:22.402 --> 01:24:23.683]  It's not working.
[01:24:23.683 --> 01:24:28.065]  And so what happens is here you have pre-pandemic.
[01:24:28.065 --> 01:24:30.486]  All of a sudden the pandemic hits.
[01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:32.927]  They issue a moratorium.
[01:24:32.927 --> 01:24:34.108]  People stop paying.
[01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:37.594]  There's a lot of forbearances going on.
[01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:40.619]  People are starting to go, oh, how are we going to survive?
[01:24:40.619 --> 01:24:45.445]  All of a sudden, all the mom and pop businesses we used to work at aren't open anymore.
[01:24:45.445 --> 01:24:47.909]  Oh my God, what are we going to do for income?
[01:24:47.909 --> 01:24:48.810]  And now what have they done?
[01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:51.995]  They've gone out and used their credit cards to live on.
[01:24:52.555 --> 01:25:02.267]  And pay their bills and buy their groceries and get deeper and deeper in debt to where now all that disposable income is paying interest on interest.
[01:25:02.267 --> 01:25:08.034]  I mean, they just keep peeling those dollar bills off folks and just set them on fire because they're all just going to the bank.
[01:25:08.849 --> 01:25:13.570]  And literally, then all of a sudden here, the pandemic is now supposedly over.
[01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:21.212]  If they don't keep, you know, if Scarecrow in the White House and giggles his sidekick doesn't keep extending the emergency, the COVID emergency.
[01:25:21.212 --> 01:25:26.073]  The thing is, is that the your basic pandemic is over.
[01:25:26.073 --> 01:25:28.253]  And all of a sudden, the moratorium has been lifted.
[01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:31.094]  And all of a sudden, look at all those people that got into trouble.
[01:25:32.057 --> 01:25:36.139]  Are now at risk of losing their house in the state of California alone.
[01:25:36.139 --> 01:25:43.764]  We have 14,000 plus active foreclosures, followed by Texas and Florida, ranking second and third.
[01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:46.425]  And the states, I mean, all the numbers are stacking up.
[01:25:46.425 --> 01:25:56.211]  If you just go online and look at all of the foreclosure activity, look at Adam Data and the number of foreclosures that we're getting from Adam Data, it's just ridiculous.
[01:25:56.211 --> 01:26:01.114]  I mean, we have direct contact with them in San Diego and we're constantly talking to them about the data.
[01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:04.435]  And the data is showing that people are faltering.
[01:26:04.435 --> 01:26:10.558]  At least 25% of America right now is 60 days behind in their mortgage payment.
[01:26:10.558 --> 01:26:13.719]  Believe it or not, they're struggling to keep up.
[01:26:13.719 --> 01:26:18.581]  And this is exactly what the banks want, because when you're 30 days behind, you're in default.
[01:26:18.581 --> 01:26:22.442]  And when you're in default, well, see, if you don't know, you might not be in default.
[01:26:22.442 --> 01:26:24.183]  And that's where MERS comes in.
[01:26:24.183 --> 01:26:29.325]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got to tell you these things, because if you have a MERS mortgage,
[01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:35.173]  It means, you know, one, yeah, the price of the house is going down, like you said, Owen.
[01:26:35.173 --> 01:26:40.058]  But the thing is, is I see prices of real estate in Florida are going through the roof.
[01:26:40.058 --> 01:26:44.442]  A house that, you know, I may have sold for $450,000 is now worth $650,000.
[01:26:44.442 --> 01:26:45.804]  So in certain areas of the country,
[01:26:46.454 --> 01:26:56.018]  They're skyrocketing because Florida is like the last free state in America where people want to live 12 months of the year.
[01:26:56.018 --> 01:27:04.361]  And you know, you mentioned the thing about the extension of the COVID emergency, and maybe that's why our governor, Greg Abbott, he just extended it in Texas and didn't barely make the news.
[01:27:04.361 --> 01:27:06.782]  Greg Abbott just extended the COVID emergency here.
[01:27:06.782 --> 01:27:11.264]  Maybe that's because he's seeing all these people still behind in their payments, because it's definitely not a health thing.
[01:27:12.668 --> 01:27:13.208]  Oh no.
[01:27:13.208 --> 01:27:21.793]  No, this is a real problem because see people get behind and they get into credit debt and I mean if you look at the statistics on credit debt, it's huge.
[01:27:21.793 --> 01:27:26.296]  One of the things that we're trying to impress on people is look, you've got to go to the land records.
[01:27:27.034 --> 01:27:30.576]  In Florida, for example, all 67 counties are online.
[01:27:30.576 --> 01:27:36.219]  You can actually go and look up anybody's land record online, which identity thieves are now doing.
[01:27:36.219 --> 01:27:44.464]  And if you're not living in Florida full-time, and you're not checking your land records, you literally risk having identity thieves come in, find the place that you're living,
[01:27:45.084 --> 01:27:55.071]  Go look up your utility bills using the information from the land records, finding out how leveraged you are, and then saying, oh, they got a lot of equity in their house, let's steal the title.
[01:27:55.071 --> 01:28:03.696]  So they go and record a phony quitclaim deed and turn around and put your house on the market and sell it, and you're not there because you're a snowbird and you live there six months out of the year.
[01:28:03.696 --> 01:28:07.399]  So, you know, if you're not paying attention to what's going on in the land records at least now,
[01:28:08.112 --> 01:28:09.653]  With all of this garbage going on?
[01:28:09.653 --> 01:28:17.377]  I mean, seriously, somebody is going to come in, could it be a servicer, an identity thief, or whatever the case may be, you risk having your house stolen out from under you.
[01:28:18.146 --> 01:28:28.554]  This is basically a no-holds-barred, get-everything-you-can, grab-everything-you-can, while-the-panic-is-going-on, and all the stuff that you're watching right now, Rowan, Owen, is a rope-a-dope.
[01:28:28.554 --> 01:28:29.956]  Remember Sugar Ray Leonard?
[01:28:29.956 --> 01:28:33.038]  Used to do this, he used to swing with one hand while he was beating you with the other.
[01:28:33.038 --> 01:28:42.185]  I mean, this is exactly what's going on, and people gotta get this cognitive dissonance out of their brain and start looking at the Hegelian dialectic, which is exactly what's getting played.
[01:28:42.185 --> 01:28:43.947]  They want a solution, they want globalist government.
[01:28:43.947 --> 01:28:45.588]  Well, let's do that, let's talk solutions.
[01:28:45.588 --> 01:28:46.549]  We're inching closer.
[01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:49.496]  Let's talk solutions on the other side here.
[01:28:49.496 --> 01:28:52.904]  People are struggling with this so they don't lose their property.
[01:28:52.904 --> 01:28:54.909]  Let's talk about solutions on the other side with Dave Krieger.
[01:28:59.093 --> 01:29:03.655]  Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:29:03.655 --> 01:29:08.857]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[01:29:08.857 --> 01:29:13.700]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:18.642]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:29:18.642 --> 01:29:27.686]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[01:29:28.166 --> 01:29:41.153]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[01:29:41.153 --> 01:29:45.095]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[01:29:45.975 --> 01:29:46.556]  300%.
[01:29:46.556 --> 01:29:49.657]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:29:49.657 --> 01:29:55.940]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.042]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[01:29:59.042 --> 01:30:04.405]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[01:30:05.285 --> 01:30:13.667]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[01:30:13.667 --> 01:30:15.908]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[01:30:15.908 --> 01:30:19.389]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[01:30:19.389 --> 01:30:22.750]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[01:30:23.468 --> 01:30:30.151]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:35.974]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[01:30:35.974 --> 01:30:39.215]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[01:30:39.275 --> 01:30:40.155]  We're good to go.
[01:30:58.726 --> 01:31:11.233]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[01:31:14.053 --> 01:31:24.298]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[01:31:24.298 --> 01:31:36.123]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:37.644]  This is why they attack us.
[01:31:38.144 --> 01:31:40.665]  This is why we need your support.
[01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:42.466]  Because we tell the truth.
[01:31:42.466 --> 01:31:44.647]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:44.647 --> 01:31:46.128]  Join the resistance.
[01:31:46.128 --> 01:31:47.408]  Buy products.
[01:31:47.408 --> 01:31:49.209]  Donate to the cause.
[01:31:49.209 --> 01:31:50.550]  Share the links.
[01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.991]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[01:31:52.991 --> 01:31:55.192]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:04.884]  The Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:32:04.884 --> 01:32:12.787]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:32:12.787 --> 01:32:16.307]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:32:16.307 --> 01:32:24.910]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:32:25.671 --> 01:32:32.747]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at Mega Corporation.
[01:32:33.576 --> 01:32:43.982]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:32:43.982 --> 01:32:46.744]  You will then be my slave.
[01:32:46.744 --> 01:32:51.526]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:32:51.526 --> 01:32:57.450]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[01:33:00.447 --> 01:33:05.050]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:15.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.017 --> 01:33:19.360]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.064]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:24.064 --> 01:33:26.846]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:27.691 --> 01:33:41.962]  Alright, we've got Dave Krieger with us, talking about the issues in the housing market, and I want him to address how you can protect your property from these predatory bankers and real estate agents.
[01:33:41.962 --> 01:33:46.665]  Folks, remember everything we do here is made possible by your support at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:33:46.665 --> 01:33:55.252]  And you know Bone Broth Plus is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com, but for today's audience, if you're tuned in, you can get it 40% off
[01:33:56.613 --> 01:34:09.020]  With coupon code FREEALEX at checkout, we'll get you 40% off Ultimate Bone Broth Plus back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:19.567]  I know personally I'm excited this is finally back in stock because I like putting the Ultimate Bone Broth Plus powder in my protein shakes post-workout to get a nice recovery and
[01:34:20.814 --> 01:34:21.755]  Muscle gain.
[01:34:21.755 --> 01:34:27.382]  So, you can get it 40% off right now at Infowarsstore.com using coupon code FREEALEX.
[01:34:27.382 --> 01:34:32.688]  Alright, Dave, how can individuals dealing with this protect their property?
[01:34:32.688 --> 01:34:33.489]  What do they need to know?
[01:34:34.676 --> 01:34:38.198]  Well, the first thing, Owen, they've got to look at their chain of title.
[01:34:38.198 --> 01:34:43.402]  They've got to know what's in their documents that they signed when they took out their mortgage loan.
[01:34:43.402 --> 01:34:44.183]  That's number one.
[01:34:44.183 --> 01:34:52.208]  Because we see more people now affected by securitized paper and they have absolutely zero idea who actually owns their home.
[01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:56.751]  This has been discussed, you know, we did that when I wrote the book Clouded Titles and released it in 2010.
[01:34:58.312 --> 01:35:11.315]  Who'd have thought that I'd have been running into federal judges who were literally asking me, what is it you're doing that has MERS so mad at you that they're exploding in the courtroom while you're sitting in there trying to have you thrown out?
[01:35:11.315 --> 01:35:13.455]  What has MERS freaked out about?
[01:35:13.455 --> 01:35:14.535]  Because I'm telling the truth.
[01:35:14.535 --> 01:35:18.676]  And I handed them a copy of the book, Clauded Titles, and the federal magistrate started laughing.
[01:35:18.676 --> 01:35:20.117]  They know the truth.
[01:35:20.117 --> 01:35:22.217]  It's just that nobody's given them a decent case.
[01:35:22.972 --> 01:35:24.093]  To hang their hat on.
[01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:28.096]  They can't rule on something when you don't have concrete evidence.
[01:35:28.096 --> 01:35:30.658]  And here's part of the problem we have right now.
[01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:40.445]  In getting to your solution, you actually have to prove according to a case ruled in 2016 called Spokio v. Robbins by the Supreme Court.
[01:35:40.965 --> 01:35:45.327]  That's that little social media site, the platform Spokio.
[01:35:45.327 --> 01:35:46.887]  Kind of works like Ben Verified.
[01:35:46.887 --> 01:35:50.349]  It's a place where you can go look up people like MyLife.com and all that.
[01:35:50.349 --> 01:35:53.990]  Well, Spokio was sued by a guy named Robbins in the Ninth Circuit.
[01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:55.551]  Went to the Supreme Court.
[01:35:55.551 --> 01:35:59.673]  He was saying, oh, well, you pretty much messed me over under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
[01:35:59.673 --> 01:36:06.995]  And the Supreme Court goes, uh, you don't have a case because you haven't suffered actual concrete injury in fact.
[01:36:06.995 --> 01:36:08.096]  So now what that means
[01:36:09.729 --> 01:36:12.031]  It speaks to the homeowner.
[01:36:12.031 --> 01:36:15.534]  And Texas, by the way, has accepted the jurisprudence of that case.
[01:36:15.534 --> 01:36:26.481]  I have been told by attorneys I work with all over the country, and in Texas, that Spokane v. Robbins actually is acknowledged in the state of Texas and elsewhere.
[01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:27.462]  You have to look that up.
[01:36:27.462 --> 01:36:28.903]  You've got to know.
[01:36:28.903 --> 01:36:29.764]  Knowledge is power.
[01:36:29.764 --> 01:36:31.585]  And if you don't have it, you're going to lose.
[01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.727]  If you think that you can go into court pro se,
[01:36:34.486 --> 01:36:41.648]  Or pro per, or you're a patriot and you think that you can go in and yell Title 41, or I don't care what these people are doing.
[01:36:41.648 --> 01:36:43.429]  These judges are gearing up for this.
[01:36:43.429 --> 01:36:44.989]  This is like a SWAT team.
[01:36:44.989 --> 01:36:47.810]  They know you are armed, you're inside your house.
[01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:51.111]  See, the way to keep them away from you is knowledge.
[01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:54.712]  And if you don't check your land records, first off, that's number one.
[01:36:54.712 --> 01:36:56.133]  Check your land records.
[01:36:56.133 --> 01:37:01.134]  Get every single document from the time that you got a hold of the property by warranty deed.
[01:37:01.134 --> 01:37:02.735]  If you're in California, it's a grant deed.
[01:37:03.496 --> 01:37:18.030]  And then, once you have that warranty deed in your hot little hand, pull every other document, mortgage, whatever the case may be, if you're in a deed of trust state, like Texas or California, most of the Ninth Circuit is a deed of trust state.
[01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:24.376]  And they, you know, there are mortgage states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, these are people that actually get sued!
[01:37:25.553 --> 01:37:29.976]  And when they get sued, they at least have time to go to court and respond.
[01:37:29.976 --> 01:37:32.818]  In the deed of trust states, you don't have any time.
[01:37:32.818 --> 01:37:37.421]  They immediately put your house on the auction block, they set a date, and it's gone.
[01:37:37.421 --> 01:37:39.562]  So the one thing you have to do is be aware.
[01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:48.948]  The time to prepare to do battle with the banks is before you feel like, Oh, I can't make my mortgage payment this month.
[01:37:48.948 --> 01:37:50.449]  Oh, I just lost my job.
[01:37:50.449 --> 01:37:52.130]  I got a medical emergency.
[01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:52.791]  What do I do?
[01:37:53.672 --> 01:38:06.495]  You just need to start researching your land records and see what kind of garbage is being filed because the first time you're 30 days late, all of a sudden, one of these securitized mortgage loans all of a sudden rears its ugly head vis-a-vis the servicer.
[01:38:06.495 --> 01:38:12.917]  Now the mortgage loan servicers won't tell you the truth, and the truth is the remix according to the Internal Revenue Code
[01:38:13.895 --> 01:38:27.479]  Section 860G, D through G, they can only stay open one year, which means that when you took your mortgage loan out, say you took out a mortgage loan in 2004, in 2005 that remit is closed.
[01:38:27.479 --> 01:38:29.959]  They lose their tax-exempt status.
[01:38:29.959 --> 01:38:40.902]  So the servicer, what they're doing now with their little employee base out there, is they're going and they're drafting these assignments, which they agreed in 2012 they weren't going to do.
[01:38:40.902 --> 01:38:42.983]  And they record these assignments in the land records.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.121]  And they basically are claiming they own your loan.
[01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:52.043]  Or they transferred it into a REMIC trust, which was created in New York or Delaware.
[01:38:52.043 --> 01:38:56.444]  What they're not telling you is the REMIC trust closed.
[01:38:56.444 --> 01:38:58.325]  It's not in existence anymore, so...
[01:38:59.341 --> 01:39:02.564]  Who's really trying to come after your property?
[01:39:02.564 --> 01:39:04.046]  You see, that's the big secret.
[01:39:04.046 --> 01:39:07.349]  Well, it's not a secret now because I'm going to tell you who's coming after it.
[01:39:07.349 --> 01:39:09.651]  It's the bloody mortgage loan servicer.
[01:39:09.651 --> 01:39:10.091]  Why?
[01:39:10.091 --> 01:39:14.836]  Because they have an agreement under the operating agreements of the prospectus.
[01:39:14.836 --> 01:39:20.061]  The investors popped all that money into that trust that you got loaned to buy your home.
[01:39:20.061 --> 01:39:21.062]  They have to pay.
[01:39:21.062 --> 01:39:24.305]  The servicer's got to pay your principal and interest every month.
[01:39:25.265 --> 01:39:28.007]  Whether you pay it or not.
[01:39:28.007 --> 01:39:29.828]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:39:29.828 --> 01:39:45.299]  If you don't make a mortgage payment for six months, the Remix Servicer has to make the payment principal and interest for you on the distribution date, which is usually somewhere between the 20th and 25th of every month before the due date.
[01:39:45.299 --> 01:39:47.340]  So if you don't make your payment, guess what?
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.361]  It's still being paid!
[01:39:49.039 --> 01:39:50.980]  How then can you be in default?
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:53.362]  And what does the mortgage loan servicer do?
[01:39:53.362 --> 01:40:02.267]  They hire a law firm, they come after you, and they send you letters saying you're in default, you haven't made a payment in six months, and now we're going to take your house.
[01:40:02.267 --> 01:40:06.829]  Well, the thing is, is what they don't want to tell the judge or anybody else is they're lying.
[01:40:06.829 --> 01:40:08.790]  They don't own your mortgage loan.
[01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:11.572]  They're servicing your mortgage loan, and what they're trying to do
[01:40:12.435 --> 01:40:18.720]  Is dummy up phony documents, put them in the land records, and if you don't go check them, you don't know if they're gonna be there.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.104]  Solution number one, you gotta go check the land records and see if one of these bogus documents is in there.
[01:40:24.104 --> 01:40:26.806]  If it is, you've got ammunition.
[01:40:26.806 --> 01:40:37.994]  And if it's recently recorded, you are allowed to, like for example under Texas law, under 16.033 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, you are allowed to challenge the validity of that document.
[01:40:38.587 --> 01:40:41.850]  But you see, the legislature got manipulated, Owen!
[01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:45.812]  And they said they put a two-year cap on when the document was recorded.
[01:40:45.812 --> 01:40:52.558]  So if you're not paying attention to what's in the land records, you're already at a disadvantage when it comes to the foreclosure.
[01:40:52.558 --> 01:40:55.680]  I have seen stuff where I know the REMIC is closed.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:00.243]  We've got proof from the Secretary of State of Delaware that the REMIC is closed.
[01:41:00.243 --> 01:41:02.765]  Yet the servicer is trying to steal the house.
[01:41:02.765 --> 01:41:03.826]  And why?
[01:41:03.826 --> 01:41:06.148]  Because they're going to sell it on the courthouse steps.
[01:41:06.758 --> 01:41:16.841]  They're going to get the proceeds, and the servicer's going to put it in their pocket, and the investors and the lender, who was originally in the game, isn't going to get a dime.
[01:41:16.841 --> 01:41:18.001]  Neither is the REMIC.
[01:41:18.001 --> 01:41:34.586]  They've already been paid off because of the credit default swaps, the default insurance, the LPMI, the PMI, all of the stuff that you were paying for as a homeowner, they're getting paid multiple times over, which is why I said earlier in the show, you have a $500,000 mortgage that is making securitization
[01:41:35.146 --> 01:41:36.967]  That whole game, $7 million.
[01:41:36.967 --> 01:41:38.688]  And that's how they're doing it.
[01:41:38.688 --> 01:41:41.529]  And now the servicer comes in, they want the gravy.
[01:41:41.529 --> 01:41:50.072]  So they're going to sell your house, and they're going to reimburse themselves for all that money they had to pay the Remick investors when you didn't make your payment.
[01:41:50.072 --> 01:41:51.093]  And then some.
[01:41:51.093 --> 01:41:52.753]  Good luck getting the surplus.
[01:41:52.753 --> 01:42:01.777]  They're going to pocket all that money, you get nothing, but butkus, and you end up out on the street joining all those other homeless people that are out there in tent cities.
[01:42:01.777 --> 01:42:02.918]  We don't want that to happen.
[01:42:03.858 --> 01:42:14.142]  Numero uno, and I know we're coming up to the break here, numero uno, you've got to go to the land records and get out your complete chain of title as both the grantee and the grantor.
[01:42:14.142 --> 01:42:15.422]  And you've got to pull this stuff.
[01:42:15.422 --> 01:42:18.043]  If you need more information, there's my website.
[01:42:18.043 --> 01:42:20.484]  You can email me at cloudedtitles at gmail.com.
[01:42:20.484 --> 01:42:23.245]  I don't mind giving you the information because that's what we're here to do.
[01:42:23.245 --> 01:42:24.266]  We're helping.
[01:42:24.266 --> 01:42:26.727]  And I don't take money from people I can't help, frankly, Owen.
[01:42:26.727 --> 01:42:28.747]  We're very honest and we're very transparent here.
[01:42:28.747 --> 01:42:32.849]  And that's one of the reasons why I'm glad we're on the show, because we get to explain what's going on.
[01:42:33.464 --> 01:42:36.225]  Well, and this is going to become, I think, more of an issue, sadly.
[01:42:36.225 --> 01:42:41.026]  I don't see the economy getting any better in the next two years with Biden still in the White House.
[01:42:41.026 --> 01:42:42.707]  So, this could be an issue for many people.
[01:42:42.707 --> 01:42:47.649]  Remember that website, cloudedtitles.com, and, of course, the Power Hour as well.
[01:42:47.649 --> 01:42:50.890]  Dave Krieger, appreciate your time and service today.
[01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:51.930]  We appreciate you, Owen.
[01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:53.431]  Thanks so much for bringing the truth out.
[01:42:53.431 --> 01:42:57.532]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, the Paul Pelosi body cam footage.
[01:42:59.366 --> 01:43:02.548]  InfoWars MD is finally here.

[01:43:59.445 --> 01:44:02.827]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:44:02.827 --> 01:44:13.112]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:44:13.112 --> 01:44:16.874]  But, through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds.
[01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:18.112]  We're good to go.
[01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:38.312]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now.

[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.201]  I'm good.
[01:45:27.461 --> 01:45:34.863]  What they're sold on stores, over 20% off what they're sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[01:45:34.863 --> 01:45:35.963]  These are incredible.
[01:45:35.963 --> 01:45:42.405]  Pain MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course, 1776 Testosterone Boost.

[01:45:55.869 --> 01:45:56.709]  InfoWars Platinum.

[01:45:59.170 --> 01:46:06.754]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:46:06.754 --> 01:46:08.355]  We're actually winning the InfoWare.
[01:46:08.355 --> 01:46:18.520]  And when you realize that BandDot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:24.243]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at BandDot Video.
[01:46:24.243 --> 01:46:25.144]  Millions of people a day
[01:46:25.504 --> 01:46:26.285]  We're good to go.
[01:47:00.618 --> 01:47:06.504]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:24.758 --> 01:47:42.426]  Alright, the Paul Pelosi hammer attack body cam footage has just been released and so I just want to play it for you raw here and then kind of give you some of the commentary or observations that are being made afterwards.
[01:47:42.426 --> 01:47:49.090]  So let's just first go, it's about just under two minutes here, police body cam footage just released of the police
[01:47:50.467 --> 01:47:55.930]  Approaching the house and opening the door and then the hammer attack all in a short two minute time span.
[01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:56.330]  Here it is.
[01:47:56.330 --> 01:48:07.296]  I definitely don't want all of you.
[01:48:07.296 --> 01:48:09.477]  I definitely don't want all of you.
[01:48:09.477 --> 01:48:09.637]  Hello?
[01:48:25.103 --> 01:48:26.763]  Yeah.
[01:48:26.763 --> 01:48:29.164]  He said 2620, right?
[01:48:29.164 --> 01:48:30.104]  No, 2640.
[01:48:30.104 --> 01:48:30.244]  Oh.
[01:48:30.244 --> 01:48:32.525]  Yeah, it literally said that.
[01:48:32.525 --> 01:48:32.645]  Hi.
[01:48:32.645 --> 01:48:33.105]  Hey, guys.
[01:48:33.105 --> 01:48:37.006]  How you doing?
[01:48:37.006 --> 01:48:38.066]  How are you?
[01:48:38.066 --> 01:48:38.926]  What's going on, man?
[01:48:38.926 --> 01:48:42.427]  Everything's good.
[01:48:42.427 --> 01:48:43.107]  Hi.
[01:48:43.107 --> 01:48:44.308]  Drop the hammer.
[01:48:44.308 --> 01:48:45.168]  Um, no.
[01:48:45.168 --> 01:48:45.708]  Hey.
[01:48:45.708 --> 01:48:46.588]  Hey, hey, hey.
[01:48:46.588 --> 01:48:47.689]  What is going on right now?
[01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:48.829]  Sorry, I'm not getting an answer.
[01:48:48.829 --> 01:48:49.309]  I'm probably...
[01:49:06.525 --> 01:49:08.706]  Everyone, 14 Edwards, send backup, Code 3.
[01:49:08.706 --> 01:49:11.126]  Code 3, back up.
[01:49:11.126 --> 01:49:14.567]  Give me your f***ing hand!
[01:49:14.567 --> 01:49:27.031]  Give me your f***ing hand!
[01:49:27.031 --> 01:49:31.172]  Everyone, 14 Edwards, send medics, Code 3 as well.
[01:49:31.172 --> 01:49:31.792]  You got it?
[01:49:31.792 --> 01:49:32.452]  Affirmative.
[01:49:36.823 --> 01:49:42.584]  Now, there's also been a new police phone call recording released.
[01:49:42.584 --> 01:49:44.564]  I don't know, do we have that one on hand, guys?
[01:49:44.564 --> 01:49:46.425]  I didn't send that to you.
[01:49:46.425 --> 01:49:53.466]  But the Paul Pelosi phone call to the police has been released as well.
[01:49:53.466 --> 01:49:56.267]  Do we do have that?
[01:49:56.267 --> 01:49:59.907]  It's about 30 or a minute.
[01:49:59.907 --> 01:50:02.928]  So, from the video though, and let's be clear, I mean, look.
[01:50:04.192 --> 01:50:06.154]  That's brutal.
[01:50:06.154 --> 01:50:11.718]  Paul Pelosi gets whacked over the head with a hammer and is bleeding out on the ground there.
[01:50:11.718 --> 01:50:14.200]  And so that's not fun to watch.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:22.847]  But the narrative that this was right-wing, MAGA extremist, Trump caused it, clearly that's BS.
[01:50:22.847 --> 01:50:26.630]  And there's something else going on here that we don't know about.
[01:50:26.630 --> 01:50:32.735]  Now, whatever the guy's politics were, there's something else going on here.
[01:50:34.468 --> 01:50:42.397]  Because in the police phone call that's just been released, Pelosi actually says, no, I don't need police.
[01:50:42.397 --> 01:50:45.681]  In the phone call, he says, no, I don't need the police.
[01:50:45.681 --> 01:50:53.631]  He then goes on to request capital police, which to me indicates that
[01:50:54.847 --> 01:51:17.666]  The Pelosi family has some sort of a deal with the Capitol Police that he felt more comfortable having the Capitol Police there so they could control this situation, whatever it is, and he didn't want the local police there because they're not under the control, the influence, the corruption of the Pelosi family, is kind of my response to that.
[01:51:17.666 --> 01:51:22.490]  Because why wouldn't you want the San Francisco police there if you're about to be hammered with a
[01:51:24.091 --> 01:51:27.012]  Ballpoint hammer or whatever.
[01:51:27.012 --> 01:51:31.013]  Why would you not want the police there, whether it was Capitol Police or the San Francisco Police?
[01:51:31.013 --> 01:51:34.914]  To me, that's, hey, I know I got to deal with the Capitol Police, I can cover this thing up.
[01:51:34.914 --> 01:51:38.775]  I don't want the San Francisco Police coming here, because then I might end up in some trouble.
[01:51:38.775 --> 01:51:42.176]  But that's all on the phone call.
[01:51:42.176 --> 01:51:47.538]  And then, guys, just give me the moment when they open the door again, if you would, in slow motion here.
[01:51:49.006 --> 01:52:08.394]  Because I just got a it's kind of hard to see it's moving quickly, but Paul Pelosi is in his underwear The other guy he's with also appears to perhaps be in underwear I mean his his his butt gets exposed during this whole thing So why is Paul Pelosi in his pajamas and his underwear?
[01:52:08.394 --> 01:52:16.558]  Why does he seem so cool calm and collected when he opens the door even though they're both holding on to the hammer and kind of smirking to there's like a weird smirk and
[01:52:19.031 --> 01:52:22.353]  Right, and there is the drink in his hand too.
[01:52:22.353 --> 01:52:23.394]  What is that about?
[01:52:23.394 --> 01:52:33.001]  Now look, I'll be honest, you listen to Pelosi call in the police phone call that was released, and you listen to Pelosi talk, I mean, he doesn't sound drunk.
[01:52:33.001 --> 01:52:35.843]  I mean, he doesn't sound like he's drunk.
[01:52:35.843 --> 01:52:40.086]  So I don't know if him being drunk is an issue on this.
[01:52:41.906 --> 01:52:47.050]  But, uh, again, it just, where is any evidence that this has anything to do with politics?
[01:52:47.050 --> 01:52:50.772]  Where is any evidence that this has anything to do with Trump or conservatives?
[01:52:50.772 --> 01:52:52.653]  It's not there, it never was there.
[01:52:52.653 --> 01:52:58.758]  That was the narrative that the Pelosi's wanted out there, and so their friends in the media helped them out in that regard.
[01:52:58.758 --> 01:52:59.979]  What is the true story here?
[01:52:59.979 --> 01:53:01.239]  I'm not sure.
[01:53:01.239 --> 01:53:03.341]  Obviously more questions are going to be asked.
[01:53:03.341 --> 01:53:07.604]  Here is the Pelosi phone call to the police, which again, just begs more questions.
[01:53:08.522 --> 01:53:09.603]  Please stand at 4.
[01:53:09.603 --> 01:53:14.706]  Oh, I guess I, I guess I, uh, I told my mistake.
[01:53:14.706 --> 01:53:16.246]  What is this?
[01:53:16.246 --> 01:53:17.607]  This is San Francisco Police.
[01:53:17.607 --> 01:53:21.049]  Do you need help?
[01:53:21.049 --> 01:53:22.330]  Oh, what is this, gentlemen?
[01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:25.832]  Uh, here, just waiting for my wife to come back.
[01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:27.153]  Nancy Pelosi.
[01:53:27.153 --> 01:53:35.217]  Uh, he's just, uh, waiting for her to come back, but she's not going to be here for a day, so I guess we'll have to wait.
[01:53:35.217 --> 01:53:35.958]  So, so, pause it.
[01:53:37.048 --> 01:53:37.488]  Why?
[01:53:37.488 --> 01:53:39.509]  Pelosi seems a little confused at the beginning there.
[01:53:39.509 --> 01:53:40.250]  He says, what is this?
[01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:41.871]  What am I doing here?
[01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:44.072]  So who called the police?
[01:53:44.072 --> 01:53:47.014]  Did he call the police?
[01:53:47.014 --> 01:53:49.375]  Was he expecting to get the Capitol police?
[01:53:49.375 --> 01:53:53.777]  And when it was the San Francisco police, all of a sudden he didn't want to talk, but he kind of felt awkward on the phone?
[01:53:53.777 --> 01:53:55.679]  That's odd.
[01:53:55.679 --> 01:53:56.819]  Continue.
[01:53:56.819 --> 01:53:58.700]  Did police fire a medical for anything?
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:01.962]  I don't think so.
[01:54:01.962 --> 01:54:02.642]  I don't think so.
[01:54:05.823 --> 01:54:10.205]  Is the Capitol Police around?
[01:54:10.205 --> 01:54:14.626]  They usually protect my wife.
[01:54:14.626 --> 01:54:16.267]  They're usually here at the house.
[01:54:16.267 --> 01:54:17.487]  Protecting my wife.
[01:54:17.487 --> 01:54:19.248]  No, this is San Francisco Police.
[01:54:19.248 --> 01:54:19.728]  I understand.
[01:54:38.288 --> 01:54:42.329]  Now he's asking the other guy what he thinks.
[01:54:42.329 --> 01:54:45.230]  Thinks about what?
[01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:48.191]  So Pelosi obviously didn't want to talk to the San Francisco police.
[01:54:48.191 --> 01:54:50.312]  He didn't want the San Francisco police to even show up.
[01:54:51.806 --> 01:54:57.430]  Why was the demand or the request made for Capitol Police multiple times?
[01:54:57.430 --> 01:55:04.134]  Why is he asking his supposed home invader, hammer attacker, what he thinks about the situation?
[01:55:04.134 --> 01:55:05.055]  That don't add up.
[01:55:05.055 --> 01:55:05.515]  Continue.
[01:55:05.515 --> 01:55:10.478]  He thinks everything's good.
[01:55:10.478 --> 01:55:13.861]  I've got a problem, but he thinks everything's good.
[01:55:13.861 --> 01:55:14.541]  Okay.
[01:55:14.541 --> 01:55:17.103]  Call us back if you change your mind.
[01:55:17.103 --> 01:55:17.843]  No, no, no.
[01:55:17.843 --> 01:55:19.965]  This gentleman just came into the house.
[01:55:20.794 --> 01:55:23.936]  Uh, and he wants you to wait here for my wife to come home.
[01:55:23.936 --> 01:55:27.819]  And so, uh... Anyway, he told me to put the phone down.
[01:55:27.819 --> 01:55:30.361]  Do you know who the person is?
[01:55:30.361 --> 01:55:31.682]  No, I don't know who he is.
[01:55:31.682 --> 01:55:38.367]  He, uh... Uh, he has just, he's telling me... He's telling me not to, uh... He's telling me not to do anything.
[01:55:38.367 --> 01:55:39.548]  What is your address, sir?
[01:55:39.548 --> 01:55:42.089]  Uh... 26... What is your name?
[01:55:42.089 --> 01:55:44.091]  Uh, my name is Paul Pelosi.
[01:55:53.226 --> 01:56:01.170]  Anyway, this gentleman says that, uh, he thinks everything oughta, you know, he's telling me to put the phone down.
[01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:03.731]  And, uh, just do what he says.
[01:56:03.731 --> 01:56:04.552]  Okay?
[01:56:04.552 --> 01:56:06.212]  Okay, who, what's the gentleman's name?
[01:56:06.212 --> 01:56:07.773]  I don't know.
[01:56:07.773 --> 01:56:08.614]  What's that?
[01:56:08.614 --> 01:56:10.174]  My name's David.
[01:56:10.174 --> 01:56:12.896]  David, his name is David.
[01:56:12.896 --> 01:56:15.137]  Okay, and who is David?
[01:56:15.137 --> 01:56:16.377]  I, I don't know.
[01:56:16.377 --> 01:56:17.738]  What's that?
[01:56:17.738 --> 01:56:19.279]  I'm a friend of theirs.
[01:56:19.279 --> 01:56:21.600]  Yeah, I, I, um, he says he's a friend, but...
[01:56:22.105 --> 01:56:25.188]  But you don't know who he is?
[01:56:25.188 --> 01:56:25.868]  No, ma'am.
[01:56:25.868 --> 01:56:26.709]  Okay.
[01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:35.817]  He's telling me I'm being very leading, so I gotta stop talking to you, okay?
[01:56:35.817 --> 01:56:36.458]  Okay.
[01:56:36.458 --> 01:56:36.878]  You sure?
[01:56:36.878 --> 01:56:39.921]  I can stay on the phone with you just to make sure everything's okay.
[01:56:39.921 --> 01:56:44.225]  No, he wants me to get the hell off the phone.
[01:56:44.225 --> 01:56:44.445]  Okay.
[01:56:44.445 --> 01:56:44.945]  Okay.
[01:56:44.945 --> 01:56:45.285]  Thank you.
[01:56:45.285 --> 01:56:45.666]  Okay, bye.
[01:56:49.679 --> 01:56:54.762]  And then obviously the San Francisco police show up at the house and then you saw the body cam footage.
[01:56:54.762 --> 01:56:59.365]  So look, there's more questions than answers here.
[01:56:59.365 --> 01:57:09.711]  And what DePape was doing there, why he was requesting Nancy Pelosi, or what's going on between him, Paul, and the Hammer, we still don't know.
[01:57:10.796 --> 01:57:14.419]  But boy, they love to jump to the conclusions and blame Trump.
[01:57:14.419 --> 01:57:17.622]  And they love to jump to the conclusions and blame Republicans.
[01:57:17.622 --> 01:57:21.966]  And they love to jump to conclusions and say, see, conservative terrorism.
[01:57:21.966 --> 01:57:25.750]  With, so far, I've seen no evidence of the sort.
[01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:26.991]  Maybe there's something there.
[01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:28.292]  Haven't seen it, though.
[01:57:28.292 --> 01:57:29.954]  Here's what we do know is going on.
[01:57:29.954 --> 01:57:34.358]  Democrats and liberals are burning the city of Atlanta to the ground again.
[01:57:35.572 --> 01:57:42.698]  State of emergency, National Guard called in, more Democrat Party terrorism, completely ignored by the mainstream media.
[01:57:42.698 --> 01:57:43.859]  We know what that is.
[01:57:43.859 --> 01:57:45.701]  We don't know what that was, but they lie about that.
[01:57:49.386 --> 01:57:51.388]  Infowars has made history.
[01:57:51.388 --> 01:57:54.010]  You have made history by supporting Infowars.
[01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:57.193]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[01:57:57.193 --> 01:58:00.656]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[01:58:00.656 --> 01:58:02.197]  Let's win the war.
[01:58:02.197 --> 01:58:03.959]  The information war.
[01:58:03.959 --> 01:58:08.743]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping Infowars on air and the fight for liberty.
[01:58:08.743 --> 01:58:10.545]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[01:58:10.805 --> 01:58:24.913]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four-coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[01:58:49.301 --> 01:58:55.726]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.
[01:58:55.726 --> 01:59:00.349]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD.
[01:59:00.349 --> 01:59:03.151]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[01:59:03.151 --> 01:59:05.373]  for supplements is owned by a Patreon.
[01:59:05.373 --> 01:59:12.138]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[01:59:12.138 --> 01:59:15.521]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.
[01:59:16.141 --> 01:59:26.806]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands that are the highest rated under the InfoWars label, InfoWars MD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:59:41.853 --> 01:59:44.176]  Of Infowars MD.
[01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:47.361]  This is the best deal out there and it keeps Infowars on the air.
[01:59:47.361 --> 01:59:52.467]  Infowars MD.
[01:59:52.467 --> 01:59:56.392]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:11.846 --> 02:00:12.567]  So the U.S.
[02:00:12.567 --> 02:00:24.879]  flag was seen flying upside down over the House of Republicans, or excuse me, the House of Representatives this morning, but it appears really that the bracket at the top of it just broke.
[02:00:24.879 --> 02:00:31.325]  But some strong symbolism there, even though unintentional.
[02:00:31.325 --> 02:00:34.489]  Some strong symbolism there.
[02:00:36.058 --> 02:00:39.141]  Now, you want to see the state of things with the Democrat Party.
[02:00:39.141 --> 02:00:41.824]  You want to see the state of things with the Biden administration.
[02:00:41.824 --> 02:00:46.808]  Remember, you had Biden's Supreme Court justice nominee.
[02:00:47.964 --> 02:00:49.545]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations to all of you.
[02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:31.608]  Judge, on the far end, tell me what Article 5 of the Constitution does.
[02:01:31.608 --> 02:01:34.169]  Article 5 is not coming to mind at the moment.
[02:01:34.169 --> 02:01:35.310]  Okay.
[02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:40.374]  How about Article 2?
[02:01:40.374 --> 02:01:41.275]  Neither is Article 2.
[02:01:48.015 --> 02:01:50.091]  Do you know what purposivism is?
[02:01:54.304 --> 02:02:04.589]  Um, in my twelve years as an Assistant Attorney General, and my nine years serving as a judge, I was not faced with that precise question.
[02:02:04.589 --> 02:02:19.456]  Um, we are the highest trial court in Washington State, so I'm frequently faced with, um, issues that I'm not familiar with, and I thoroughly review the law, our research, and apply the law to the facts presented to me.
[02:02:19.456 --> 02:02:22.318]  Well, you're going to be faced with it as a, if you're confirmed.
[02:02:23.283 --> 02:02:28.545]  I can assure you of that.
[02:02:28.545 --> 02:02:37.787]  So, Biden nominees don't know what a woman is, and Biden nominees don't even know the Constitution!
[02:02:37.787 --> 02:02:39.948]  Are we really that surprised?
[02:02:39.948 --> 02:02:43.789]  Now imagine this, I've got this whole story about all the economic devastation.
[02:02:44.949 --> 02:02:49.931]  Biden to families struggling to put food on the table, buy a new energy efficient refrigerator.
[02:02:49.931 --> 02:02:51.451]  Imagine the out of touch here.
[02:02:51.451 --> 02:02:54.532]  Hey, I can't afford my gas at the pump anymore.
[02:02:54.532 --> 02:02:57.493]  By the way, gas prices are back up, in case you didn't notice.
[02:02:57.493 --> 02:03:00.574]  Oh, I can't afford price of the pump anymore, so buy a new car.
[02:03:00.574 --> 02:03:02.455]  Oh, that's even more expensive.
[02:03:02.455 --> 02:03:05.256]  Hey, I can't afford groceries anymore, so buy a new fridge.
[02:03:05.256 --> 02:03:06.817]  That's even more expensive.
[02:03:06.817 --> 02:03:09.238]  Just totally out of touch.
[02:03:09.238 --> 02:03:12.119]  Americans fall behind on car payments at higher rate than in 2009.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:20.996]  And then Debbie Stabenow has the nerve to tell you this, Democrat Senator in clip 13.
[02:03:22.168 --> 02:03:25.989]  They all ran on how costs were too high in the election.
[02:03:25.989 --> 02:03:38.654]  I mean, we're the ones fighting to bring down energy costs, $1,000 per family back in their pockets, $35 cap on insulin for seniors right now, right now, happening right now.
[02:03:38.654 --> 02:03:44.936]  So what do they say we should do to deal with this debt, with the debt they're talking about?
[02:03:44.936 --> 02:03:47.177]  Oh, let's have a 30% sales tax increase.
[02:03:49.096 --> 02:03:58.199]  So, imagine a Democrat sitting there, the economy has tanked since they took over, and imagine them sitting there acting like it's Republicans' fault, which they're doing.
[02:03:58.199 --> 02:04:07.301]  Karine Jean-Pierre, in a press conference just two days ago, said that, I literally, you can't even make this stuff up.
[02:04:07.301 --> 02:04:12.603]  She said that they were cutting taxes, but they were also raising taxes.
[02:04:12.603 --> 02:04:14.063]  I can't even remember what she said.
[02:04:14.063 --> 02:04:17.324]  It was just, it's total insanity.
[02:04:17.324 --> 02:04:17.524]  So,
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:21.442]  I just, I don't even know what to say.
[02:04:21.442 --> 02:04:27.288]  I mean, you've seen what's happened to the economy post Biden.
[02:04:27.288 --> 02:04:31.832]  You've seen all the energy bills, the gas bills, the grocery bills, all of it go up.
[02:04:31.832 --> 02:04:34.135]  And then they sit there and they tell you they're fighting it.
[02:04:34.135 --> 02:04:36.557]  They sit there and they tell you they're making the economy better.
[02:04:36.557 --> 02:04:39.640]  They sit there and they tell you Republicans are the problem.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:42.063]  And then they say, we're raising taxes.
[02:04:44.568 --> 02:04:50.089]  You know, folks, look, I don't like... I wish we could all get along, but I'm just gonna tell it like it is.
[02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:53.289]  Liberal Democrats are psychotic, lying scumbags.
[02:04:53.289 --> 02:04:54.070]  I'm sorry!
[02:04:54.070 --> 02:04:56.550]  We all have friends, we all have family, but that's what they are!
[02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:57.070]  I'm sick of it!
[02:04:57.070 --> 02:05:03.371]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:05:03.371 --> 02:05:05.692]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:05:05.692 --> 02:05:09.632]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:05:09.632 --> 02:05:13.553]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:05:15.003 --> 02:05:18.547]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:05:18.547 --> 02:05:25.435]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:27.377]  It's really just incredible.
[02:05:27.377 --> 02:05:30.260]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:35.966]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:05:36.787 --> 02:05:37.748]  I know you spread the word.
[02:05:37.748 --> 02:05:39.250]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:39.830]  Keep doing it.
[02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:48.759]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarestore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:05:48.759 --> 02:05:53.084]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarestore.com.
[02:05:53.084 --> 02:05:58.029]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarestore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:05:58.029 --> 02:05:58.810]  Please take action now.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:12.145]  We're now joined by Dr. Kevin Stillwagon and Josh Yoder, U.S.
[02:06:12.145 --> 02:06:15.808]  Freedom Flyers, and we're discussing
[02:06:34.042 --> 02:06:40.165]  What's going on with the vaccine, the airline pilots, the freedom to choose.
[02:06:40.165 --> 02:06:49.869]  But guys, I mean, I guess the story kind of tells itself here, where now you have private flights, private pilots with the elite that fly on these.
[02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:53.111]  Saying, oh, we only want pilots that are not vaccinated.
[02:06:53.111 --> 02:06:55.332]  Oh boy, that's a telling story!
[02:06:55.332 --> 02:07:04.858]  You also have airline companies loosening their medical requirements when it comes to cardiac events, because they know that these are becoming a more significant issue.
[02:07:04.858 --> 02:07:11.221]  So, Dr. Kevin Stillwagon and Josh Yoder with us here at usfreedomflyers.org.
[02:07:11.221 --> 02:07:13.623]  Where do you guys want to begin on this issue today?
[02:07:14.463 --> 02:07:19.768]  The people that didn't take the vaccine are the ones that are feeling a lot better about that decision now.
[02:07:19.768 --> 02:07:23.951]  And now it looks like maybe the rest of the economy is starting to catch up with that.
[02:07:23.951 --> 02:07:28.075]  Where do you guys want to start this conversation?
[02:07:28.075 --> 02:07:35.641]  Well, I'd like to start with the fact that the FAA has totally turned their head and looked the other way on this issue.
[02:07:35.641 --> 02:07:38.284]  Pilots have in fact been injured by vaccines.
[02:07:38.983 --> 02:07:42.206]  We have documented evidence of that.
[02:07:42.206 --> 02:07:53.835]  The chief surgeon at the FAA, her name is Dr. Susan Northrup, she has stated that no pilot has been incapacitated or injured by the shot.
[02:07:53.835 --> 02:07:55.256]  That's an absolute lie.
[02:07:55.256 --> 02:07:56.377]  She knows that.
[02:07:56.377 --> 02:08:00.881]  She's been provided with the names and telephone numbers of pilots that have been injured.
[02:08:01.421 --> 02:08:04.202]  And she wants to do absolutely nothing about it.
[02:08:04.202 --> 02:08:10.984]  Now listen, this is a government organization that is totally broken, and it needs to be fixed.
[02:08:10.984 --> 02:08:15.285]  Another one that's broken is the CDC, but they're finally starting to crack.
[02:08:15.285 --> 02:08:28.008]  In fact, just a couple of days ago, his name is Dr. Shyam Shimabukuro, and he is the Deputy Director of the Immunization Safety Office of the CDC, and he admitted
[02:08:28.638 --> 02:08:33.781]  That the COVID-19 shot is in fact causing debilitating illnesses.
[02:08:33.781 --> 02:08:48.111]  Now, if the CDC can go ahead and admit that, it's time for somebody at the FAA to step up and acknowledge that yes, there have been injuries and we need to do something about it before we have a disaster.
[02:08:49.502 --> 02:08:52.424]  Now, Josh, I would imagine the group U.S.
[02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:56.867]  Freedom Flyers has grown a lot since you had initially launched it.
[02:08:56.867 --> 02:09:00.250]  What is the current status of that?
[02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:00.670]  It has.
[02:09:00.670 --> 02:09:03.652]  It is growing by leaps and bounds, Owen.
[02:09:03.652 --> 02:09:09.076]  And what's really interesting is now it's the vaccinated who are joining us and we're helping them get medical care.
[02:09:09.076 --> 02:09:17.743]  You know, the administration, the FAA, the airlines are completely gaslighting these four individuals who are now being affected by these toxic shots.
[02:09:18.423 --> 02:09:24.047]  Just in the past five days now, I've received eight phone calls from pilots who are experiencing issues.
[02:09:24.047 --> 02:09:26.388]  In one case, it was a young female.
[02:09:26.388 --> 02:09:28.230]  She's 24 years old.
[02:09:28.230 --> 02:09:42.339]  She was a bodybuilder, got the first Moderna shot, and within 18 hours, she was having cardiac arrest symptoms, and now she's been diagnosed with vaccine-induced myocarditis, and we've put her in touch with cardiologists who are now treating her for that.
[02:09:42.819 --> 02:09:44.082]  That's just one story of many.
[02:09:44.082 --> 02:09:54.000]  We obviously have, you know, Captain Bob Snow, who everyone knows, you know, he went into cardiac arrest within, you know, six minutes of landing in Airbus 321 in Dallas Fort Worth back in April 22.
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:55.620]  I think so.
[02:10:17.811 --> 02:10:24.320]  There was an experienced Czech airman in that right seat that was able to bring that aircraft back around and land it in Chicago, O'Hare.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:29.527]  If we keep burying our heads in the sand and we don't address this issue, this is something that's not going to end well.
[02:10:30.083 --> 02:10:35.066]  Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, the next event might not be so lucky, let's say.
[02:10:35.066 --> 02:10:42.349]  And another question I have here, I've probably, I mean, I'm not the guy flying around thousands of times, but I've probably been on 50, 60 flights in my life.
[02:10:42.349 --> 02:10:48.232]  I've never had an incident of a medical emergency while in flight.
[02:10:48.232 --> 02:10:53.995]  My most recent flight that happened, and luckily enough for the gentleman that was having the
[02:10:55.416 --> 02:11:03.181]  Heart problems on the plane, we were about 30 minutes from landing anyway, so the emergency landing was the desired airport already, where we were going to land.
[02:11:03.181 --> 02:11:12.747]  But it was like, this guy was having a medical emergency, when as soon as we landed, they had the team get him off the plane, the medical team was there waiting as soon as he got there.
[02:11:12.747 --> 02:11:14.988]  I've never seen that in my life, flying.
[02:11:14.988 --> 02:11:17.630]  Are we hearing more about these events happening on planes as well?
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:22.241]  Well, I can't say for sure.
[02:11:22.241 --> 02:11:29.064]  I have been contacted by air traffic controllers who have told me that the incidence of flight diversions is up considerably.
[02:11:29.064 --> 02:11:33.627]  Now, as far as getting that actual data, it's something that would probably have to be done through a lawsuit.
[02:11:33.627 --> 02:11:39.630]  We have been trying to gather that data, but unfortunately, the air traffic controllers, if they were to provide me that, they would be fired.
[02:11:40.823 --> 02:11:46.147]  There has been a significant increase in emergency calls by aircraft.
[02:11:46.147 --> 02:11:48.288]  There's actually an app, a bot, that tracks that.
[02:11:48.288 --> 02:11:50.290]  So that's been something interesting to watch.
[02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:55.034]  But what I'm hearing just from my fellow crew members and what I've seen myself, there seems to be an uptick.
[02:11:55.034 --> 02:11:59.337]  You know, while anecdotal, there certainly is something going on.
[02:11:59.337 --> 02:12:01.219]  Dr. Stillwagon, you can respond to that as well.
[02:12:02.794 --> 02:12:07.376]  Yeah, so, you know, before I get going too much here, I need to give you a little bit of my background.
[02:12:07.376 --> 02:12:23.284]  So, I'm not a cardiologist, I'm actually a retired chiropractor, and I've been in the aviation industry for a very long time, since 1973, and professionally for over 33 years as an airline pilot, over 21 years as a captain for Delta Airlines.
[02:12:23.823 --> 02:12:33.570]  During that time, I got a chiropractic degree and I did some extracurricular studies on the immune system and also the dangers of all vaccines, not just this one.
[02:12:33.570 --> 02:12:37.834]  I've kept up on the pathophysiology of what vaccines can do to your body.
[02:12:37.834 --> 02:12:48.482]  I've also kept up on general anatomy and physiology for the entire body because I was teaching chiropractors courses on how to keep their licenses active.
[02:12:49.262 --> 02:12:51.964]  I'm up on everything that's going on right now.
[02:12:51.964 --> 02:12:57.569]  I can talk intelligently about aviation safety because I've been involved in it for so long.
[02:12:57.569 --> 02:13:03.914]  And I also understand the pathophysiology of what's going on when this shot is injected into the body.
[02:13:03.914 --> 02:13:09.279]  And so, yeah, we are seeing definite incidences of pilot injuries that are occurring.
[02:13:09.279 --> 02:13:14.243]  Now, the problem is some of these injuries that are happening are what's called subclinical.
[02:13:14.243 --> 02:13:16.925]  In other words, there are absolutely no symptoms whatsoever.
[02:13:17.423 --> 02:13:20.705]  And a classic example of that is myocarditis.
[02:13:20.705 --> 02:13:24.668]  Myocarditis is an inflammation of the musculature around the heart.
[02:13:24.668 --> 02:13:29.712]  It can be the heart muscle itself or it can be the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart.
[02:13:29.712 --> 02:13:34.275]  And what this does is it causes some swelling that occurs in there.
[02:13:34.275 --> 02:13:36.297]  More fluids come in.
[02:13:36.297 --> 02:13:39.980]  Cytokines, which are secreted by your immune cells, come in.
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:45.744]  And what this does is it disrupts the normal flow of electrical energy through your heart.
[02:13:46.434 --> 02:13:57.603]  And this can be completely undetected by the pilot, but the problem is it can lead to a sudden death syndrome, a sudden stoppage of the heart.
[02:13:57.603 --> 02:14:01.286]  We've seen this happen to many athletes on the field.
[02:14:01.286 --> 02:14:07.050]  It's happening right in front of your face, and people are just denying the fact that that's what this could be.
[02:14:07.050 --> 02:14:09.953]  A very simple explanation is an increase of
[02:14:10.655 --> 02:14:13.778]  Uh, what are called endorphins or adrenalines.
[02:14:13.778 --> 02:14:20.843]  Uh, if, if you get overexcited and, uh, for example, and this, this can happen on sports fields.
[02:14:20.843 --> 02:14:22.544]  It can also happen in the cockpit.
[02:14:22.544 --> 02:14:24.966]  And this is what we're kind of concerned about.
[02:14:24.966 --> 02:14:33.393]  Aviation has been described as hours and hours and hours of boredom interspersed with just a few seconds of stark terror.
[02:14:34.068 --> 02:14:54.889]  And when you get that surprise in the cockpit, whether it be a medical emergency, which you just mentioned happening, Owen, or maybe something goes wrong with the aircraft, or maybe there's a delay of the aircraft and you're getting low on fuel, you know, all of these things will cause the body to call for an increased heart rate.
[02:14:55.289 --> 02:15:09.380]  Now, if you've got myocarditis, it's causing these very subtle arrhythmias, you could end up getting a major fibrillation of either the atricles or the ventricles of your heart and they just basically sit there and flutter.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:16.786]  They don't pump the blood properly and you're going to lose consciousness and that's a significant problem.
[02:15:16.786 --> 02:15:17.186]  It's hidden.
[02:15:18.527 --> 02:15:29.709]  Well, and again, the media and even our politicians have an interest in making sure the public doesn't know this is going on, because they pushed the vaccines for over a year.
[02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:32.970]  They said safe and effective over and over and over again.
[02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:41.571]  And so instead of doing the right thing and just saying, hey, I was wrong, or even if they want to say, hey, I was misled, instead they just want to bury it and they want to act like it's not going on.
[02:15:41.571 --> 02:15:45.212]  But like you both have said, I mean, this is getting to be such a big issue.
[02:15:45.212 --> 02:15:46.412]  Eventually, there's no way.
[02:15:46.892 --> 02:15:48.133]  To avoid this conversation.
[02:15:48.133 --> 02:15:52.676]  Eventually there's no way to avoid the cause of all of these issues.
[02:15:52.676 --> 02:15:56.398]  We'll be right back with Josh Yoder and Dr. Kevin Stillwagon.
[02:15:57.677 --> 02:16:00.698]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[02:16:00.698 --> 02:16:03.478]  And InfoWars has been the tip of the spear against tyranny.
[02:16:03.478 --> 02:16:08.900]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:11.780]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:17.642]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:16:17.642 --> 02:16:20.663]  It's finally back in stock for 50% off at InfoWarsHaw.com.
[02:16:22.523 --> 02:16:27.945]  Now, in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients that are in it, but this sucker is amazing.
[02:16:27.945 --> 02:16:33.267]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:33.267 --> 02:16:37.609]  Every one of these will supercharge your day and everything you do.
[02:16:37.609 --> 02:16:40.470]  Just look at the Preglanone that we've got that's in this product.
[02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:44.351]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:17:04.989 --> 02:17:15.359]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:17:15.359 --> 02:17:28.111]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:17:28.792 --> 02:17:29.373]  We're good to go.
[02:17:57.788 --> 02:18:10.310]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:18:13.115 --> 02:18:23.361]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:35.187]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:18:35.187 --> 02:18:36.708]  This is why they attack us.
[02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.732]  This is why we need your support.
[02:18:39.732 --> 02:18:41.534]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:18:41.534 --> 02:18:43.717]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:43.717 --> 02:18:45.159]  Join the resistance.
[02:18:45.159 --> 02:18:46.460]  Buy products.
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:48.263]  Donate to the cause.
[02:18:48.263 --> 02:18:49.625]  Share the links.
[02:18:49.625 --> 02:18:52.068]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[02:18:52.068 --> 02:18:54.271]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:18:57.634 --> 02:19:03.796]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[02:19:03.796 --> 02:19:16.779]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarstore.com right now and taking action.
[02:19:16.779 --> 02:19:21.740]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.801]  Keep Info Wars on the air.
[02:19:23.801 --> 02:19:26.102]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:19:26.102 --> 02:19:27.562]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:19:27.562 --> 02:19:28.803]  They're coming for me.
[02:19:28.803 --> 02:19:30.043]  They're coming for the children.
[02:19:30.043 --> 02:19:32.624]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:19:32.624 --> 02:19:35.985]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:19:35.985 --> 02:19:37.306]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:19:37.546 --> 02:19:39.628]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[02:19:39.628 --> 02:19:45.072]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[02:19:45.072 --> 02:19:48.975]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[02:19:48.975 --> 02:19:50.196]  Let's do it together.
[02:19:50.196 --> 02:19:52.497]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:52.497 --> 02:19:56.300]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:00.023]  Now take action now!
[02:20:00.023 --> 02:20:05.928]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:18.744 --> 02:20:26.745]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:26.745 --> 02:20:30.426]  Guests Dr. Kevin Stillwagon and Josh Yoder are with me.
[02:20:39.082 --> 02:20:44.704]  And Josh, what have you noticed in the last two years or so?
[02:20:44.704 --> 02:20:51.167]  You know, the vaccine mandates, but the wishy-washy from the FAA.
[02:20:51.167 --> 02:20:55.868]  Just all the different changes in policy, all the different standards.
[02:20:55.868 --> 02:21:02.731]  I mean, talk about where it's at, all the flip-flopping, and what they need to do now to address this issue.
[02:21:04.636 --> 02:21:10.956]  Well, the FAA essentially broke their own regulations when they brought these emergency use drugs on the market and encouraged all pilots to take them.
[02:21:11.534 --> 02:21:19.941]  In their own guidance for aeromedical examiners, it states very clearly that no medical product should be given to a pilot until 12 months post-full FDA approval.
[02:21:19.941 --> 02:21:24.905]  And this is for the very purpose of ensuring that there are no negative side effects that could affect the safety of flight.
[02:21:24.905 --> 02:21:28.228]  We warned the FAA about this back on December 15th of 2021.
[02:21:28.228 --> 02:21:38.537]  We put cases in front of them of pilots who had been incapacitated and they did not heed those warnings and they've continued to push forward, once again violating their own guidance and regulations.
[02:21:39.117 --> 02:21:46.340]  So as we find ourselves in this current position where pilots are being vaccine injured, they obviously don't want to admit that they were wrong.
[02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:51.742]  This also goes for the airlines who mandated the product and then the unions who didn't represent the unvaccinated.
[02:21:51.742 --> 02:22:02.886]  Everybody in this scenario has criminal and civil liability, so you're not going to see them coming forward and admitting that they made a mistake and being proactive in ensuring that we don't end up with a fatal accident on our hands.
[02:22:02.886 --> 02:22:05.467]  We've come so close so many times now.
[02:22:05.467 --> 02:22:06.788]  There's been a significant increase
[02:22:07.428 --> 02:22:13.095]  In single-pilot aircraft accidents that have gone up, I talk routinely with people inside the FAA.
[02:22:13.095 --> 02:22:16.940]  They're telling me that what they're seeing is exceptionally concerning.
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:18.561]  I know what we're seeing at the airlines.
[02:22:18.561 --> 02:22:22.286]  Obviously, the people that reach out to me, which is a small percentage of the people actually being affected.
[02:22:22.987 --> 02:22:29.690]  Now why is it with the small private aircraft, we're seeing more of an incident, I mean the crashes are up, we know that.
[02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:33.271]  Is that because there's really only one trained pilot?
[02:22:33.271 --> 02:22:34.632]  Is there less autopilot?
[02:22:34.632 --> 02:22:36.072]  Is there a trainee with him?
[02:22:36.072 --> 02:22:40.834]  Why does that phenomenon happen more often than with the big commercial flights?
[02:22:40.834 --> 02:22:41.674]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:22:41.674 --> 02:22:42.915]  There's no pilot redundancy.
[02:22:42.915 --> 02:22:48.517]  You see what the FAA and the airlines are counting on is something we call pilot redundancy, where you have two fully qualified pilots in the flight deck.
[02:22:49.048 --> 02:22:54.391]  However, if you're out here flying around in a small private aircraft, in most cases, you don't have that.
[02:22:54.391 --> 02:22:57.033]  They're certified to be flown single pilot.
[02:22:57.033 --> 02:23:07.660]  So should that pilot experience a cardiac event or a stroke or something like that while they're flying, there's a high probability they're not going to be able to recover from that.
[02:23:07.660 --> 02:23:13.083]  Dr. Kevin Stillwagon, what does the FAA need to do right now to correct this issue?
[02:23:13.083 --> 02:23:14.004]  What should they be doing?
[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:19.402]  Okay, first of all, I'd like to talk about why we got to where we are.
[02:23:19.402 --> 02:23:22.024]  This all rolled out because of fear.
[02:23:22.024 --> 02:23:24.785]  It was unsubstantiated, propagated fear.
[02:23:24.785 --> 02:23:29.468]  They had everybody convinced that this was a deadly virus and it was going to kill everybody.
[02:23:29.468 --> 02:23:33.130]  Now look, they had a Petri dish to look at.
[02:23:33.130 --> 02:23:37.453]  It was the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off of Japan for two weeks.
[02:23:38.371 --> 02:23:43.492]  And the only people that died after becoming infected were old and frail.
[02:23:43.492 --> 02:23:46.413]  So it's basically the same as a normal flu season.
[02:23:46.413 --> 02:23:54.175]  Now I realize that people did get sick and some of them got really sick, yes, but the people who died were elderly and they were comorbid.
[02:23:54.175 --> 02:23:57.436]  That does not fit into the category of airline pilots.
[02:23:58.118 --> 02:24:23.582]  And so it was a lie right from the start when they said that you need to go out and get this vaccine because it is going to protect you from becoming infected and it's also going to protect others from being infected because it will stop the spread and they've admitted that now that it was a total lie and they knew that from the beginning and any any doctor worth their salt would know that because very simply the
[02:24:24.142 --> 02:24:27.504]  The goal of a vaccine is to create what's called an antibody.
[02:24:27.504 --> 02:24:31.085]  An antibody is something that is always inside of your body.
[02:24:31.085 --> 02:24:37.008]  It can't stop a virus from getting in and it can't stop the virus from spreading once it does get in.
[02:24:37.008 --> 02:24:39.629]  That's basic immunology 101.
[02:24:39.629 --> 02:24:49.034]  And so the idea of this creating an antibody is so that the antibody will be there to react to the infection when you get infected again
[02:24:49.574 --> 02:24:49.875]  I think so.
[02:25:08.016 --> 02:25:16.097]  What this shot does is it creates one little part of that virus called the spike protein that has already mutated in nature.
[02:25:16.097 --> 02:25:18.178]  It doesn't even exist anymore.
[02:25:18.178 --> 02:25:25.139]  And so the antibody that's being created by this shot cannot stop the infection, cannot stop the spread.
[02:25:25.139 --> 02:25:30.540]  In fact, it binds to the virus in such a way that it actually makes it easier for you to get infected.
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:35.381]  And in some instances, the cases actually get worse and the people end up in the hospital.
[02:25:35.381 --> 02:25:36.401]  So that's what we're seeing.
[02:25:37.037 --> 02:25:38.278]  That's what it doesn't do.
[02:25:38.278 --> 02:25:39.639]  It doesn't stop infection.
[02:25:39.639 --> 02:25:40.920]  It doesn't stop the spread.
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:42.701]  But what does it do?
[02:25:42.701 --> 02:25:45.364]  It does cause myocarditis.
[02:25:45.364 --> 02:25:46.544]  That's known.
[02:25:46.544 --> 02:25:49.847]  It's in the black box warning that comes with the shot.
[02:25:49.847 --> 02:25:52.969]  Myocarditis is a problem in a pilot.
[02:25:52.969 --> 02:26:00.015]  If you have a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis, you absolutely are not to be issued a medical certificate.
[02:26:00.015 --> 02:26:03.978]  You can't fly an aircraft of any size, even a small Cessna.
[02:26:04.398 --> 02:26:09.886]  And the reason is because you could end up getting sudden death with this.
[02:26:09.886 --> 02:26:10.867]  This is not good.
[02:26:10.867 --> 02:26:13.250]  And they knew that right from the start.
[02:26:13.250 --> 02:26:15.433]  So what does the FAA need to do right now?
[02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:18.217]  They need to start looking for this problem.
[02:26:18.217 --> 02:26:19.038]  They need to look.
[02:26:19.631 --> 02:26:22.593]  The way you look is you do simple tests right now.
[02:26:22.593 --> 02:26:28.455]  They're not expensive, but they can be rolled out where pilots can be tested for levels of D-dimer.
[02:26:28.455 --> 02:26:32.297]  That will show that there's increased clotting that's happening in your body.
[02:26:32.297 --> 02:26:34.779]  And we know that clotting is an issue with the shot.
[02:26:34.779 --> 02:26:37.220]  And you can also do troponin level checks.
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:40.642]  Troponin level checks will tell you if you have heart damage.
[02:26:40.642 --> 02:26:48.686]  Now, these things aren't necessarily going to ground a pilot, but it will give indication that we need to look further in that pilot.
[02:26:48.686 --> 02:26:49.086]  Now, look.
[02:26:49.686 --> 02:26:53.770]  I realize that not every pilot is going to get myocarditis.
[02:26:53.770 --> 02:27:03.098]  Not everybody who got the shot is going to have an adverse reaction, and that's because of the extreme variability of the way this shot is put into people.
[02:27:03.098 --> 02:27:06.661]  You have no idea where the tip of the needle is when they push that plunger.
[02:27:06.661 --> 02:27:16.510]  If it's in a vein or an arterial bed, those lipid nanoparticles that are in the shot are going to rapidly spread to your brain and to your heart, and then you increase your chances of having an adverse reaction.
[02:27:16.989 --> 02:27:21.574]  Also, you have absolutely no idea how many particles are in that shot.
[02:27:21.574 --> 02:27:26.640]  It all depends upon how it was manufactured and how it was mixed when it gets on the other end.
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:31.485]  The technician has to mix it in a very special way and pull it into that syringe.
[02:27:31.485 --> 02:27:38.093]  And they're instructed to look at it three times to make sure it looks a certain way so that you don't get injected with coagulating goo.
[02:27:39.491 --> 02:27:49.476]  There is polyethylene glycol in there that's supposed to keep those lipid nanoparticles separated because they're fatty bubbles and they'll tend to stick together.
[02:27:49.476 --> 02:27:57.699]  So if you get injected with something that's already coagulating, you could end up having a serious stroke or a heart attack within hours.
[02:27:59.184 --> 02:28:02.646]  Or even minutes sometimes, and we've seen that happen.
[02:28:02.646 --> 02:28:06.828]  So the FAA needs to right now admit that they made a mistake.
[02:28:06.828 --> 02:28:10.170]  Now, as Josh mentioned, they're probably not going to do that.
[02:28:10.170 --> 02:28:12.391]  They're a government entity.
[02:28:12.391 --> 02:28:14.232]  They're afraid of what could happen.
[02:28:14.232 --> 02:28:24.297]  And so Josh is ready to pull the trigger right now on a major lawsuit against the FAA so that we can force them to look into these pilot
[02:28:25.037 --> 02:28:33.104]  Incapacitations, pilot deaths that have happened, and also pilots that have become disabled after they got this shot.
[02:28:33.104 --> 02:28:35.927]  Now listen, that takes money, okay?
[02:28:35.927 --> 02:28:37.288]  Lawyers are involved.
[02:28:37.288 --> 02:28:39.410]  This is going to be a very expensive thing.
[02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:42.252]  We're fighting a big government organization here.
[02:28:42.252 --> 02:28:43.673]  So Josh has 501c3 status with
[02:28:46.015 --> 02:28:46.296]  U.S.
[02:28:46.296 --> 02:28:53.321]  Freedom Flyers dot org and he has a give send go that's set up right now and it should be in the show notes.
[02:28:53.321 --> 02:28:54.102]  The give send go.
[02:28:54.102 --> 02:28:54.762]  Gotta take a break.
[02:28:54.762 --> 02:28:55.423]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.423 --> 02:28:57.925]  One more segment.
[02:28:57.925 --> 02:29:02.609]  I just want to say that Diet Force is amazing.
[02:29:02.609 --> 02:29:04.871]  I'm 45 and I have bits.
[02:29:04.871 --> 02:29:08.213]  I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[02:29:08.213 --> 02:29:10.735]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[02:29:12.350 --> 02:29:17.160]  Under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:19.365]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[02:29:20.541 --> 02:29:23.382]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.
[02:29:23.382 --> 02:29:25.542]  Diet Force is the go.
[02:29:25.542 --> 02:29:28.443]  You have to get the Diet Force and have to a day.
[02:29:28.443 --> 02:29:30.203]  And just keep at it.
[02:29:30.203 --> 02:29:31.704]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:31.704 --> 02:29:33.104]  X7 Diet Force.
[02:29:33.104 --> 02:29:36.065]  InfoWarsStore.com, baby!
[02:29:36.065 --> 02:29:37.605]  Now on sale.
[02:29:37.605 --> 02:29:38.326]  We're cutting that ad.
[02:29:38.326 --> 02:29:39.586]  We're cutting that call into an ad.
[02:29:39.586 --> 02:29:40.406]  I can guarantee you that.
[02:29:40.406 --> 02:29:42.407]  Thanks so much for the call, Grant.
[02:29:42.407 --> 02:29:43.947]  God bless Australia.
[02:29:43.947 --> 02:29:45.067]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:29:45.067 --> 02:29:45.687]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:29:45.687 --> 02:29:46.768]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:46.768 --> 02:29:47.388]  Diet Force.
[02:29:47.388 --> 02:29:47.828]  Get it now.
[02:29:57.799 --> 02:30:04.065]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[02:30:04.065 --> 02:30:12.433]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[02:30:12.433 --> 02:30:14.675]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[02:30:14.675 --> 02:30:21.541]  Now, that was a three coin series, the founding member coin, the final coin that we're putting out for a long time.
[02:30:22.239 --> 02:30:28.923]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com?
[02:30:28.923 --> 02:30:34.747]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[02:30:34.747 --> 02:30:37.969]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[02:30:38.149 --> 02:30:39.050]  We're good to go.
[02:30:58.038 --> 02:31:05.724]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[02:31:05.724 --> 02:31:07.786]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[02:31:07.786 --> 02:31:09.487]  They know we're telling the truth.
[02:31:09.487 --> 02:31:11.048]  They know we've got their number.
[02:31:11.048 --> 02:31:15.772]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[02:31:15.772 --> 02:31:18.374]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[02:31:18.894 --> 02:31:23.638]  That will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[02:31:23.638 --> 02:31:34.026]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[02:31:35.029 --> 02:31:35.329]  Thank you.
[02:31:57.612 --> 02:31:59.433]  Infowars is winning.
[02:31:59.433 --> 02:32:01.474]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:32:01.474 --> 02:32:04.255]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:32:04.255 --> 02:32:07.016]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:32:07.016 --> 02:32:09.117]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:32:09.117 --> 02:32:11.178]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:32:11.178 --> 02:32:12.158]  None of that's true.
[02:32:12.158 --> 02:32:13.039]  It's all being appealed.
[02:32:13.519 --> 02:32:22.486]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:32:22.486 --> 02:32:25.929]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:32:25.929 --> 02:32:28.651]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[02:32:28.651 --> 02:32:38.539]  Go to InfoWarshow.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[02:32:38.979 --> 02:32:40.340]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:44.703]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:32:44.703 --> 02:32:48.945]  Because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:32:48.945 --> 02:32:52.227]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[02:32:52.227 --> 02:32:54.208]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[02:32:54.208 --> 02:33:00.192]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:33:00.192 --> 02:33:06.096]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.059 --> 02:33:20.741]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:20.741 --> 02:33:22.442]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:22.442 --> 02:33:24.404]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.404 --> 02:33:27.447]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:32.139 --> 02:33:52.622]  You know, I want to go back into the topic about what happens when the vaccine is injected into you with Dr. Kevin Stillwagon that he brought up in the last segment, but I do want to ask about the airline standards, the health standards, and what we're seeing there, because obviously the recommendations from Dr. Stillwagon are being ignored by the FAA.
[02:33:53.843 --> 02:33:59.313]  But Josh, when it comes to the airlines, what do we know and what are we hearing about their standards or their qualifications?
[02:33:59.313 --> 02:34:05.523]  Because what I've heard is that they're loosening them so that, oh, you may have myocarditis or something, no, it's okay, you can still fly.
[02:34:05.523 --> 02:34:06.124]  What are you hearing?
[02:34:07.625 --> 02:34:10.026]  Well the FAA is actually the one who sets that standard.
[02:34:10.026 --> 02:34:14.208]  The airlines really have nothing to do with that unless it's like through lobby power.
[02:34:14.208 --> 02:34:20.511]  But it's the FAA that has made these changes and they've done it against good sound medical evidence and science.
[02:34:20.511 --> 02:34:28.335]  They claim that the recent changes were made off of new science and yet they refuse to produce the studies and the science which they claim to have in their possession.
[02:34:29.035 --> 02:34:31.157]  So this is what makes us so suspicious.
[02:34:31.157 --> 02:34:33.098]  You know, we ask for proof, we ask for evidence.
[02:34:33.098 --> 02:34:41.684]  They can never, you know, rather than produce anything, all they do is come back and basically tell us to shut up and go away and there's nothing to see here.
[02:34:41.684 --> 02:34:42.705]  And of course, U.S.
[02:34:42.705 --> 02:34:46.868]  Freedom Flyers now on the brink of bringing a lawsuit forward.
[02:34:48.692 --> 02:34:49.633]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:34:49.633 --> 02:34:51.335]  We believe that's the only way forward.
[02:34:51.335 --> 02:34:53.317]  You know, we've attempted to use dialogue.
[02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.278]  That's not working.
[02:34:54.278 --> 02:34:57.922]  Anyone who's not following Steve Kersh's substack should do so.
[02:34:57.922 --> 02:34:58.943]  This is really important.
[02:34:58.943 --> 02:35:01.946]  Steve Kersh has really helped us take the lead on this.
[02:35:01.946 --> 02:35:04.429]  He's been pummeling the FAA with questions.
[02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:06.251]  They really refuse to get back to him.
[02:35:06.251 --> 02:35:08.093]  When they do, they say things like, no comment.
[02:35:08.673 --> 02:35:13.034]  And there's nothing to see here, and we're not aware of any pilot vaccine injuries.
[02:35:13.034 --> 02:35:14.195]  These are all blatant lies.
[02:35:14.195 --> 02:35:19.316]  We put vaccine injured pilots directly in touch with the FAA, with Susan Northrup.
[02:35:19.316 --> 02:35:25.418]  They've been filling up her email inbox, sending her text messages, and yet she refuses to talk to anyone.
[02:35:25.418 --> 02:35:33.421]  She doesn't want to sit down with Captain Snow or Cody Flint or Captain Greg Pearson or Sierra Lund, all these people who have been severely injured.
[02:35:33.421 --> 02:35:34.321]  She doesn't want to hear it.
[02:35:34.321 --> 02:35:36.962]  They're putting their heads in the sand, and they're saying nothing's going on.
[02:35:38.755 --> 02:35:40.035]  Really incredible stuff, folks.
[02:35:40.035 --> 02:35:44.657]  You just saw the give-send-go for the fundraiser up there.
[02:35:44.657 --> 02:35:46.998]  We put it on the screen now.
[02:35:46.998 --> 02:35:57.061]  Dr. Stillwagon, this question kind of goes beyond just the issue with the COVID vaccines, but with the focus on the COVID vaccines, I think some other questions are being asked about all vaccines.
[02:35:57.061 --> 02:36:07.005]  But you mentioned something that kind of drew my attention for stuff I was wondering and never have been able to get a clear answer on this from multiple doctors even, oddly enough, and that's
[02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:18.715]  When they actually put that needle into your body, I mean, they just shove it right into your arm, I've never been able to get a clear answer, even from doctors, and I say, where does it go?
[02:36:18.715 --> 02:36:20.937]  Where does the juice they inject go?
[02:36:20.937 --> 02:36:22.499]  Whatever's in there, where does it go?
[02:36:22.499 --> 02:36:24.080]  I mean, they just stick it in.
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:25.421]  And so, it's interesting what you said.
[02:36:25.421 --> 02:36:27.864]  It's like, well, if it goes directly into your vein,
[02:36:28.544 --> 02:36:31.005]  You're looking at a bad situation.
[02:36:31.005 --> 02:36:39.369]  Maybe if it goes into some body fat or some muscle tissue, maybe you just get the soreness and you're not dealing with the long-term effects or some of these adverse reactions.
[02:36:39.369 --> 02:36:46.972]  But I mean, just generally speaking, because maybe there's a big answer here to some of these issues of what happens.
[02:36:46.972 --> 02:36:49.413]  The shot goes into your arm, they inject it.
[02:36:49.413 --> 02:36:49.973]  Is that it?
[02:36:49.973 --> 02:36:54.535]  If it goes right into your blood, if it goes right into your vessel, that's like, that's the bad news?
[02:36:54.535 --> 02:36:57.917]  But if it goes maybe into some fat or some muscle tissue, you're okay?
[02:36:59.454 --> 02:37:07.057]  Well, not necessarily, because it's still going to be able to spread through your body in what's called the lymphatic system.
[02:37:07.057 --> 02:37:11.379]  So, the whole idea of these shots, as I mentioned, is to create an antibody.
[02:37:11.379 --> 02:37:16.942]  And they think that the more antibodies that are made inside of you, the more protection that you're going to have.
[02:37:16.942 --> 02:37:18.062]  That's false thinking.
[02:37:18.062 --> 02:37:19.603]  It doesn't work that way.
[02:37:19.603 --> 02:37:23.365]  The protection of infection is on your epithelial barrier.
[02:37:23.365 --> 02:37:24.705]  It's mucosal.
[02:37:24.705 --> 02:37:25.666]  It's cellular.
[02:37:25.666 --> 02:37:28.187]  It doesn't have anything to do with antibodies.
[02:37:28.823 --> 02:37:42.340]  And so it's actually worse with these shots that they're using now with this mRNA technology because they're putting the messenger RNA, which is actually the message to make the spike protein.
[02:37:42.944 --> 02:37:45.887]  The spike protein is supposed to create an antibody.
[02:37:45.887 --> 02:37:49.750]  So they wrap it in what's called a lipid nanoparticle.
[02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:54.474]  Now the lipid nanoparticle is made of normal body fats.
[02:37:54.474 --> 02:37:59.039]  It's made of cholesterol and another one called DSPC.
[02:37:59.039 --> 02:38:01.701]  These are totally normal body fats.
[02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:05.985]  So when they inject this stuff into you, your body doesn't reject them.
[02:38:05.985 --> 02:38:08.227]  It fully accepts these lipid nanoparticles.
[02:38:08.767 --> 02:38:13.573]  And basically, it's made of the same stuff that all cells of your body are made of.
[02:38:13.573 --> 02:38:25.006]  And so basically, any cell that it bumps up against you, it can merge with and allow that messenger RNA that's inside of the lipid nanoparticle to get into your cell.
[02:38:25.006 --> 02:38:29.351]  It gets into the cytoplasm, it hooks up with a ribosome, and then it starts cranking out these
[02:38:30.018 --> 02:38:30.418]  I think?
[02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:54.052]  It literally goes everywhere and it does.
[02:38:54.052 --> 02:39:03.985]  And what people don't realize is that with traditional shots called vaccines or when you get a natural infection, that's not what happens in those instances.
[02:39:03.985 --> 02:39:07.831]  These things need to attach to receptors on your cells.
[02:39:08.419 --> 02:39:12.382]  There are specific receptors that will accept the attachment.
[02:39:12.382 --> 02:39:14.224]  And that's how those things work.
[02:39:14.224 --> 02:39:16.786]  This thing is totally different.
[02:39:16.786 --> 02:39:20.549]  It starts cranking out antibodies by the billions.
[02:39:20.549 --> 02:39:25.493]  Now, you know, antibodies can either be helpful or they can be very, very harmful.
[02:39:25.493 --> 02:39:30.116]  If you get the wrong kind of antibody, you're headed for serious trouble.
[02:39:30.116 --> 02:39:34.660]  Which, by the way, these COVID vaccines, that's all they produce is the wrong antibody.
[02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:35.941]  They never produce the right one.
[02:39:36.914 --> 02:39:37.695]  That's right.
[02:39:37.695 --> 02:39:44.965]  It's producing a spike protein that's creating an antibody against a protein that no longer exists in nature.
[02:39:45.669 --> 02:39:47.130]  This is not good.
[02:39:47.130 --> 02:39:51.392]  People need to wake up and just stop this nonsense right now.
[02:39:51.392 --> 02:39:57.756]  I'll give you a very simple explanation now as to why you should never get a booster shot.
[02:39:57.756 --> 02:39:59.777]  And I think this will make sense to you.
[02:39:59.777 --> 02:40:05.200]  When you get the first shot, it's going to tell your body to make spike proteins, and that's what it does.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.923]  And then your body's reaction to that is to make an antibody against the spike protein.
[02:40:09.923 --> 02:40:10.503]  That's normal.
[02:40:11.192 --> 02:40:15.155]  Also, the levels of those antibodies will naturally drop over time.
[02:40:15.155 --> 02:40:16.716]  That's normal also.
[02:40:16.716 --> 02:40:19.598]  We don't keep all of the antibodies that we ever made.
[02:40:19.598 --> 02:40:21.840]  If we did, our blood would be sludge.
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:24.382]  We'd never even be able to pump it, right?
[02:40:24.382 --> 02:40:27.805]  And so, the important thing is the memory.
[02:40:27.805 --> 02:40:30.907]  It's the memory to quickly remake these antibodies.
[02:40:31.167 --> 02:40:31.947]  Okay?
[02:40:31.947 --> 02:40:36.389]  So Fauci says, oh, your antibody levels have dropped.
[02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:38.289]  You've got to go out and get a booster shot.
[02:40:38.289 --> 02:40:40.570]  Get those antibody levels back up.
[02:40:40.570 --> 02:40:43.151]  That is the most dangerous thing that you could ever do.
[02:40:43.151 --> 02:40:44.311]  And here's why.
[02:40:44.311 --> 02:40:48.172]  Because when you get that second shot, what's it going to do?
[02:40:48.172 --> 02:40:52.234]  It's going to tell your body to make spike proteins again.
[02:40:52.234 --> 02:40:53.074]  Billions of them.
[02:40:53.715 --> 02:40:57.796]  Your immune system already dealt with that spike protein.
[02:40:57.796 --> 02:41:02.598]  So the idea of that antibody is to stop this from happening.
[02:41:02.598 --> 02:41:03.698]  You understand?
[02:41:03.698 --> 02:41:08.320]  The antibody is there to stop more of this from happening.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:09.220]  That's the whole idea.
[02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:15.462]  So what you're doing is you're injecting something into your body that your immune system cannot see.
[02:41:15.462 --> 02:41:18.203]  It's called the lipid nanoparticle.
[02:41:18.203 --> 02:41:25.886]  Again, it binds with any and all cells of your body and starts cranking out those spike proteins again by the billions.
[02:41:25.886 --> 02:41:28.687]  Your immune system sees that and overreacts.
[02:41:28.687 --> 02:41:31.128]  It kicks in what's called the complement system.
[02:41:31.648 --> 02:41:43.756]  It's highly inflammatory, it's very destructive, it brings in white blood cells to all cells of your body now that are either making spike proteins or have spike proteins attached.
[02:41:43.756 --> 02:41:51.501]  Not only is it going to destroy those cells but it's so aggressive in the way it attacks these things that it will attack normal tissue around it.
[02:41:52.171 --> 02:41:56.373]  And when this happens in the heart, that is called myocarditis.
[02:41:56.373 --> 02:42:04.278]  And this is exactly one reason why you're seeing the levels of myocarditis significantly increased after people go out and get these booster shots.
[02:42:04.278 --> 02:42:06.359]  Yeah, and that's what all the data is showing now, folks.
[02:42:06.359 --> 02:42:06.999]  It's like we said,
[02:42:07.399 --> 02:42:16.166]  I mean, you get one, you might be alright, two, okay, you get up to three and four, you're really getting to like 50% shot, you're gonna have a really bad reaction to this.
[02:42:16.166 --> 02:42:18.768]  And we thank Dr. Kevin Stillwagon for his time.
[02:42:18.768 --> 02:42:21.650]  Just quick final comment here, we got 30 seconds left, Josh Yoder.
[02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:26.634]  Just generally speaking, have the COVID vaccines made air travel more or less safe?
[02:42:28.191 --> 02:42:29.511]  They've certainly made them less safe.
[02:42:29.511 --> 02:42:34.613]  You know, the one thing that I can confidently say is that air travel is not as safe today as it was three years ago.
[02:42:34.613 --> 02:42:39.154]  Our goal is not to instill fear in the flying public, not at all, but rather to spur action.
[02:42:39.154 --> 02:42:40.795]  We need you to email the FAA.
[02:42:40.795 --> 02:42:43.655]  If you're a pastor, email the FAA, email the airlines.
[02:42:43.655 --> 02:42:46.896]  I believe we've provided you, Owen, with the email addresses for these people.
[02:42:46.896 --> 02:42:54.118]  You need to bombard them, and you need to demand that they do something about this, that they invoke change, and they admit that they're wrong.
[02:42:54.118 --> 02:42:56.899]  You know, we can work with them if they're willing to admit that we have a problem.
[02:42:58.106 --> 02:43:00.489]  Cavalry has arrived.
[02:43:00.489 --> 02:43:13.543]  Ultimate Bone Broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.
[02:43:13.903 --> 02:43:16.186]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[02:43:16.186 --> 02:43:24.254]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth, the strongest out there with chaga mushroom and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.
[02:43:24.254 --> 02:43:25.315]  The list goes on and on.

[02:44:01.243 --> 02:44:04.244]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[02:44:04.244 --> 02:44:06.825]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[02:44:06.825 --> 02:44:08.126]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[02:44:08.126 --> 02:44:12.028]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[02:44:12.028 --> 02:44:16.910]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:23.393]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[02:44:23.393 --> 02:44:32.117]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:44:32.117 --> 02:44:37.699]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[02:44:37.699 --> 02:44:43.122]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot Video for granted.
[02:44:43.362 --> 02:44:45.845]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:44:45.845 --> 02:44:48.527]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:44:48.527 --> 02:44:50.029]  So go check out the store.
[02:44:50.029 --> 02:44:51.210]  Go support their store.
[02:44:51.210 --> 02:44:52.732]  Go support InfoWars.
[02:44:52.732 --> 02:44:54.093]  Leave a donation right now.
[02:44:54.093 --> 02:44:55.574]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[02:44:57.935 --> 02:45:02.677]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[02:45:02.677 --> 02:45:07.879]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[02:45:07.879 --> 02:45:12.740]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:17.062]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[02:45:17.682 --> 02:45:27.186]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento, so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[02:45:27.186 --> 02:45:40.191]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last, at 1776coin.com.
[02:45:40.191 --> 02:45:44.133]  And just like an NPR pledge drive, where they mark up a coffee cup, or a t-shirt, or a DVD,
[02:45:45.013 --> 02:45:46.155]  300%.
[02:45:46.155 --> 02:45:48.677]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[02:45:48.677 --> 02:45:54.964]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[02:45:54.964 --> 02:45:58.107]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[02:45:58.107 --> 02:46:01.150]  InfoWars secret weapon is finally here.
[02:46:01.150 --> 02:46:06.015]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido.
[02:46:06.575 --> 02:46:09.478]  And it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:46:09.478 --> 02:46:19.025]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:46:19.025 --> 02:46:24.489]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:46:24.489 --> 02:46:29.893]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner is a listener, and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:46:29.893 --> 02:46:30.574]  You're not going to find
[02:46:30.834 --> 02:46:31.574]  We're good to go.
[02:47:00.242 --> 02:47:04.878]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:04.878 --> 02:47:06.183]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:47:34.394 --> 02:47:42.957]  You know, there's so many other things happening here, and this is my final segment before Alex and Dr. Michael Yeadon take over.
[02:47:42.957 --> 02:47:44.158]  I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[02:47:44.158 --> 02:47:45.238]  It's Veterans Call-In Show.
[02:47:45.238 --> 02:47:48.420]  We got a couple great veterans guests, plus I got all this news on my desk I haven't covered.
[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:56.423]  And, you know, there was this incident in Memphis with a police killing of an individual, and
[02:47:57.861 --> 02:47:59.802]  You're not hearing much about it.
[02:47:59.802 --> 02:48:00.342]  Why?
[02:48:00.342 --> 02:48:06.665]  Because all of the supposedly offending police officers are black.
[02:48:06.665 --> 02:48:25.055]  And so now, the left anti-police, anti-white movement, who originally built this up as, look, more police brutality, look, more white supremacy, oops, all five cops involved were black, now they're changing their tune, and they're saying, well, it's still white supremacy, it's still white culture.
[02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:40.302]  It's just unbelievable the way they'll twist and maneuver and change their logic just to fit whatever the scenario is, but always trying to maintain the same narrative, the same bottom line, despite all the evidence going against it.
[02:48:40.302 --> 02:48:44.426]  So I may get into that, but I got so much other more important news to cover.
[02:48:44.426 --> 02:48:45.927]  But I barely even plugged today, folks.
[02:48:45.927 --> 02:48:49.170]  We won't even be on air here if we don't get funding, so shop at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:48:49.170 --> 02:48:49.491]  Remember,
[02:48:50.737 --> 02:48:55.839]  Yes, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com and 25% off.

[02:49:22.549 --> 02:49:29.132]  So, you've also heard doctors coming on telling you about the Nitric Boost.
[02:49:29.132 --> 02:49:31.793]  I happen to have a bottle of this right here.
[02:49:31.793 --> 02:49:36.375]  Now, I'm somebody that's been supplementing with NO or Nitric Oxide.
[02:49:37.984 --> 02:49:38.445]  I don't know.
[02:49:54.028 --> 02:50:05.392]  This is really just kind of the super formula of years of all of that research put into a capsule, and now it's the InfoWars MD product line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:05.392 --> 02:50:19.378]  Nitric Boost promotes the synthesis and discourages the degradation of nitric oxide, which is beneficial for cardiovascular function, circulation, and muscular performance.
[02:50:20.646 --> 02:50:22.847]  So we've done a great job here with this product.
[02:50:22.847 --> 02:50:28.249]  And of course, you can get it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:28.249 --> 02:50:31.530]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:33.910]  Don't take these transmissions for granted.
[02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:36.691]  Don't take our great guests for granted, the crew for granted.
[02:50:36.691 --> 02:50:39.632]  Keep us on air shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:39.632 --> 02:50:41.613]  All right.
[02:50:41.613 --> 02:50:42.853]  Where do you go from here?
[02:50:42.853 --> 02:50:44.254]  I mean, just so much.
[02:50:44.254 --> 02:50:47.515]  I just, I don't even know where to go.
[02:50:47.515 --> 02:50:49.516]  So let's just start digging through some of these headlines.
[02:50:50.455 --> 02:50:56.840]  Before I come back and host the war room.
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:51:04.906]  Why is the Marco Polo Group editing documents found on Hunter Biden's laptop?
[02:51:04.906 --> 02:51:06.207]  Why are they?
[02:51:06.207 --> 02:51:08.909]  Well, they just don't want you to know anything about that laptop.
[02:51:08.909 --> 02:51:11.231]  They don't want you to know anything about the Biden crime family.
[02:51:11.231 --> 02:51:12.872]  Apparently the media that is so.
[02:51:16.004 --> 02:51:18.806]  The Marco Polo Group is changing documents.
[02:51:18.806 --> 02:51:20.928]  They claim to be from Hunter Biden's laptop.
[02:51:20.928 --> 02:51:27.314]  The documents might have originally been from the laptop, but the Marco Polo Group is editing them, and now they are useless because they've been edited.
[02:51:27.314 --> 02:51:28.695]  I mean, how ironic.
[02:51:28.695 --> 02:51:29.656]  Marco!
[02:51:29.656 --> 02:51:31.557]  Polo!
[02:51:31.557 --> 02:51:32.958]  Marco!
[02:51:32.958 --> 02:51:33.599]  Polo!
[02:51:33.599 --> 02:51:37.642]  You know, the whole joke is how he's blind.
[02:51:37.642 --> 02:51:38.483]  Yeah.
[02:51:38.483 --> 02:51:40.365]  And so that's how they want you to be, blind.
[02:51:40.365 --> 02:51:42.707]  They don't want you to see the political corruption of the Biden crime family.
[02:51:44.964 --> 02:51:52.666]  Ukrainian bank behind Burisma Holdings and linked to the Bidens looted and lost billions of IMF and U.S.
[02:51:52.666 --> 02:51:53.686]  funds.
[02:51:53.686 --> 02:51:59.128]  Again, the Biden crime family and all the different strings attached to them.
[02:51:59.128 --> 02:52:01.828]  Back in 2019, when the corrupt U.S.
[02:52:01.828 --> 02:52:12.231]  House under Nancy Pelosi was frantically putting together a garbage narrative of President Trump saying something wrong on a phone call, The Gateway Pundit was putting together reasons why these crooks were so adamant to get President Trump.
[02:52:13.268 --> 02:52:20.551]  Well, for many reasons, but now they put Biden in there as the placeholder and it's just been a complete disaster.
[02:52:20.551 --> 02:52:24.393]  He's been a disaster for the country and now it's all coming out.
[02:52:24.393 --> 02:52:28.334]  The criminal enterprise he was running with his family, his son, his brother.
[02:52:28.334 --> 02:52:36.098]  Hunter Biden was receiving classified State Department briefings on a regular basis used to promote Biden family business.
[02:52:37.878 --> 02:52:39.558]  This deal's not going away, folks.
[02:52:39.558 --> 02:52:40.579]  I'm telling you, it's the real deal.
[02:52:40.579 --> 02:52:45.440]  Now, they're going to try to cover it up, and they're going to try to get, you know, they don't want Biden to go down with this.
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:46.880]  They're afraid they might go down with it.
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:48.420]  But no, this is the real deal.
[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:54.662]  There are good people at the FBI investigating this, and Biden's crimes are caught.
[02:52:54.662 --> 02:52:56.362]  I mean, he's caught.
[02:52:56.362 --> 02:53:01.243]  I'm not saying that there's going to be any punishment for Biden's crimes.
[02:53:01.243 --> 02:53:03.044]  It's clear Democrats are above the law.
[02:53:03.044 --> 02:53:03.644]  We know that.
[02:53:05.236 --> 02:53:08.117]  But this is, I mean, there's going to be serious fallout from this.
[02:53:08.117 --> 02:53:13.139]  They're not going to be able to put this thing to bed so easily.
[02:53:13.139 --> 02:53:21.382]  Meanwhile, the completely insane liberals continue to display their insanity on television.
[02:53:21.382 --> 02:53:26.244]  New York Times editorial board member thinks Trump returning to Facebook would take down the country.
[02:53:26.244 --> 02:53:32.267]  I mean, just can you imagine being such a deranged lunatic?
[02:53:32.267 --> 02:53:34.848]  Can you imagine being so mentally impaired?
[02:53:37.021 --> 02:53:42.583]  Oh, the open borders with millions and millions of illegal immigrants pouring in here in a welfare state.
[02:53:42.583 --> 02:53:45.064]  Oh, that's no big deal.
[02:53:45.064 --> 02:53:50.387]  Oh, our energy being shut off, no more coal, no more natural gas, pipelines being shut down.
[02:53:50.387 --> 02:53:52.167]  Ah, that's no big deal.
[02:53:52.167 --> 02:53:57.950]  Oh, Joe Biden and the current administration wanting to start a nuclear war with Russia.
[02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:59.510]  Nah, nothing to see here.
[02:53:59.510 --> 02:54:01.891]  But Trump getting back on Facebook?
[02:54:01.891 --> 02:54:03.132]  Oh my God!
[02:54:06.087 --> 02:54:07.608]  These people are deranged, folks.
[02:54:07.608 --> 02:54:10.270]  They're mentally ill and disturbed.
[02:54:10.270 --> 02:54:16.835]  They belong in funny farms, not on TV and government.
[02:54:16.835 --> 02:54:21.019]  New poll finds significant number of Democrats doubt Joe Biden's mental fitness for office.
[02:54:21.019 --> 02:54:24.922]  Yeah, even Democrats know this guy is demented.
[02:54:24.922 --> 02:54:26.243]  His brain is broke.
[02:54:26.243 --> 02:54:26.883]  Harvard poll.
[02:54:26.883 --> 02:54:30.406]  6 in 10 have doubts over Biden's mental fitness.
[02:54:30.406 --> 02:54:31.487]  60% of America knows Biden.
[02:54:31.487 --> 02:54:31.807]  65% actually.
[02:54:33.911 --> 02:54:37.493]  No, Biden is mentally unfit for the job.
[02:54:37.493 --> 02:54:40.615]  And this whole thing is just a farce.
[02:54:40.615 --> 02:54:46.719]  Biden jokes about people thinking he's stupid, then makes another stupid verbal gaffe.
[02:54:46.719 --> 02:54:48.900]  How many times has he done this?
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:51.541]  Let me just say this clearly for you.
[02:54:51.541 --> 02:54:54.103]  Has men have finished shimminimin?
[02:54:54.103 --> 02:54:57.185]  Huh?
[02:54:57.185 --> 02:54:58.406]  Biden reading off a teleprompter.
[02:54:58.406 --> 02:54:59.646]  End of quote.
[02:54:59.646 --> 02:55:00.627]  Read next line.
[02:55:02.045 --> 02:55:04.106]  And now the more recent one.
[02:55:04.106 --> 02:55:11.368]  During an event in Springfield, Virginia, Joe Biden joked about people thinking he was stupid before making yet another embarrassing verbal gaffe.
[02:55:11.368 --> 02:55:16.350]  He was introducing Representative Don Beyer and called him Doug.
[02:55:16.350 --> 02:55:18.711]  Oops!
[02:55:18.711 --> 02:55:22.972]  Oops!
[02:55:22.972 --> 02:55:25.433]  Yikes.
[02:55:25.433 --> 02:55:29.375]  What's going on over there with Georgia and your senator?
[02:55:29.375 --> 02:55:30.215]  He is really
[02:55:32.298 --> 02:55:35.600]  Truly a scumbag, and we knew this.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:43.884]  Raphael Warnock buys $1.1 million DC home as allegations of church-sanctioned evictions resurface.
[02:55:43.884 --> 02:55:58.292]  So not only was Warnock evicting people, poor people, black people, with the housing that he owned, he was also taking in a massive salary from the church he supposedly pastors.
[02:55:59.414 --> 02:56:04.255]  Was this before or after he ran his wife over with his car?
[02:56:04.255 --> 02:56:05.475]  Just another Democrat.
[02:56:05.475 --> 02:56:14.817]  But see, the George Santos situation on the Republican side of the aisle, look, it's weird, it's odd, but here's what I like about it.
[02:56:14.817 --> 02:56:17.437]  George Santos might be good, he might be bad.
[02:56:17.437 --> 02:56:28.019]  What I like about this situation is how the House leadership under Ken McCarthy has not buckled to all the attacks against Santos demanding he resign.
[02:56:29.315 --> 02:56:32.238]  So let's just even say Santos, bad guy, scumbag.
[02:56:32.238 --> 02:56:33.339]  Well, you know what?
[02:56:33.339 --> 02:56:39.445]  You've got your entire party is filled, if you're a Democrat, with lying scumbags.
[02:56:39.445 --> 02:56:41.607]  And yet, we have to sit here and deal with them all day long.
[02:56:41.607 --> 02:56:44.169]  Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, Raphael Warnock.
[02:56:44.169 --> 02:56:50.776]  And so now, you having to sit here and deal with George Santos is just a taste of your own medicine.
[02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:54.991]  His tweet from late last night.
[02:56:54.991 --> 02:57:01.414]  From interviewing clowns to creating fake posts, the media continues to down spiral as their attempt to smear me fails.
[02:57:01.414 --> 02:57:05.997]  I am getting the job I signed up for done while you all spiral out of control.
[02:57:05.997 --> 02:57:11.740]  So look, again, whatever the case is with Santos, it's definitely a weird case.
[02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:12.600]  Doesn't look good.
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:19.244]  But, all the Democrats in the mainstream media clamoring and demanding his resignation and not getting it is just beautiful.
[02:57:20.350 --> 02:57:21.430]  It's just beautiful.
[02:57:21.430 --> 02:57:27.872]  Oh, oh, there's a guy on Congress that you look at as a total corrupt criminal scumbag, and he won't leave office?
[02:57:27.872 --> 02:57:29.992]  Now you know how we feel!
[02:57:29.992 --> 02:57:32.032]  With your entire party!
[02:57:32.032 --> 02:57:36.553]  I love it when liberals get a taste of their own medicine.
[02:57:36.553 --> 02:57:38.894]  They don't like it so much, but I enjoy it.
[02:57:38.894 --> 02:57:41.995]  Alright, Dr. Michael Eden and Alex Jones coming up next.
[02:57:41.995 --> 02:57:43.935]  I'll be back hosting the War Room Veterans Call-In Show.
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:57:58.580]  Hey, what's up, Bone?
[02:57:58.580 --> 02:57:59.521]  Hey, McBreen.
[02:57:59.521 --> 02:58:01.541]  What's going on, man?
[02:58:01.541 --> 02:58:04.622]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece.
[02:58:04.622 --> 02:58:06.282]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[02:58:06.282 --> 02:58:07.183]  I worked hard on that.
[02:58:07.183 --> 02:58:12.944]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[02:58:12.944 --> 02:58:18.246]  Oh, um, no.
[02:58:18.246 --> 02:58:19.706]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[02:58:25.615 --> 02:58:27.036]  No.
[02:58:27.036 --> 02:58:27.796]  Hmm.
[02:58:27.796 --> 02:58:28.556]  Okay.
[02:58:28.556 --> 02:58:29.497]  Yeah.
[02:58:29.497 --> 02:58:30.057]  Thanks anyway.
[02:58:30.057 --> 02:58:30.217]  Yep.
[02:58:30.217 --> 02:58:36.579]  Good luck with that project, though.
[02:58:36.579 --> 02:58:41.541]  Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at m4store.com.
[02:58:48.063 --> 02:58:49.744]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:58:49.744 --> 02:58:51.604]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:58:51.604 --> 02:58:59.688]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[02:58:59.688 --> 02:59:03.830]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:08.372]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:59:08.372 --> 02:59:13.033]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[02:59:13.033 --> 02:59:15.054]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[02:59:15.054 --> 02:59:16.435]  So please, keep me on the field.
[02:59:16.875 --> 02:59:22.079]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[02:59:33.527 --> 02:59:35.028]  But I thank you all for your support.
[02:59:35.028 --> 02:59:39.471]  Please commit now to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get great products and make donations.
[02:59:39.471 --> 02:59:40.432]  I thank you for your support.
[02:59:40.432 --> 02:59:41.653]  Now take action.
[02:59:41.653 --> 02:59:44.395]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[02:59:49.679 --> 02:59:54.285]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:54.285 --> 02:59:58.430]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.430 --> 03:00:07.502]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in existence.
[03:00:07.502 --> 03:00:08.503]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.884 --> 03:00:28.886]  Prepare yourself for a perfectly outrageous motion picture.
[03:00:28.886 --> 03:00:39.052]  Howard Beale went up there last night and said what every American feels, that he's tired of all the bull- For the sakes, Diana, we're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on national television.
[03:00:39.052 --> 03:00:44.095]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:00:44.095 --> 03:00:46.117]  There is no America.
[03:00:46.117 --> 03:00:48.638]  There is no democracy.
[03:00:48.638 --> 03:00:52.921]  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T.
[03:00:54.298 --> 03:01:00.060]  And DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.
[03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:03.262]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[03:01:03.262 --> 03:01:10.504]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!
[03:01:10.504 --> 03:01:16.347]  And you will atone!
[03:01:16.347 --> 03:01:18.828]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[03:01:18.828 --> 03:01:19.248]  Why me?
[03:01:19.892 --> 03:01:22.633]  It was your own television, dummy.
[03:01:22.633 --> 03:01:26.434]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Network News Hour with Howard Bieler!
[03:01:26.434 --> 03:01:40.080]  I can't do it.
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:41.900]  We'll do it live.
[03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:42.941]  Okay.
[03:01:42.941 --> 03:01:45.562]  We'll do it live!
[03:01:45.562 --> 03:01:46.562]  Do it live!
[03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:48.503]  I'll write it and we'll do it live!
[03:01:50.851 --> 03:01:52.753]  This whole thing sucks!
[03:01:52.753 --> 03:01:53.714]  What the hell's going on?
[03:01:53.714 --> 03:01:54.374]  I don't know.
[03:01:54.374 --> 03:01:56.517]  He just said he was going to pour his brains out.
[03:01:56.517 --> 03:01:58.659]  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today.
[03:01:58.659 --> 03:01:59.479]  I'm Bill O'Reilly.
[03:01:59.479 --> 03:02:00.560]  Thanks again for watching.
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:03.543]  We'll leave you with Sting and a cut off his new album.
[03:02:03.543 --> 03:02:04.304]  Take it away.
[03:02:04.304 --> 03:02:06.046]  Congresswoman, let me interrupt you just for a moment.
[03:02:06.046 --> 03:02:07.988]  We've got some breaking news out of Miami.
[03:02:07.988 --> 03:02:08.889]  Stand by if you will.
[03:02:10.069 --> 03:02:13.992]  Right now, in Miami, Justin Bieber has been arrested on a number of charges.
[03:02:13.992 --> 03:02:19.895]  The judge is reading the charges, including resisting arrest and bribing under the influence.
[03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:24.138]  He's appearing now before the judge for his bond hearing.
[03:02:24.138 --> 03:02:29.301]  I want a show developed based on the activities of a terrorist group.
[03:02:29.301 --> 03:02:31.243]  Well, I'm in.
[03:02:31.243 --> 03:02:33.944]  I'm gonna make a TV star out of you.
[03:02:33.944 --> 03:02:35.786]  You gonna be a household word.
[03:02:35.786 --> 03:02:37.507]  Osama Bin Laden is just one person.
[03:02:38.482 --> 03:02:49.451]  He is representative of networks of people who absolutely have made their cause to defeat the freedoms that we understand.
[03:02:49.451 --> 03:02:51.332]  And we will not allow them to do so.
[03:02:51.332 --> 03:02:56.896]  Death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat Al Qaeda.
[03:02:56.896 --> 03:03:00.219]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S.
[03:03:00.219 --> 03:03:01.260]  helicopter.
[03:03:01.260 --> 03:03:05.543]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are U.S.
[03:03:05.543 --> 03:03:06.224]  Navy SEALs.
[03:03:06.764 --> 03:03:14.427]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet.
[03:03:14.427 --> 03:03:16.767]  NATO is in command of the entire U.S.
[03:03:16.767 --> 03:03:18.428]  military publicly.
[03:03:18.428 --> 03:03:22.749]  Homeland Security now says their mission has nothing to do with Al-Qaeda, our Muslim extremists.
[03:03:22.749 --> 03:03:28.691]  It has to do with the Tea Party, who will launch police-killing terror attacks any minute.
[03:03:28.691 --> 03:03:31.292]  With no evidence of that, now it's beginning.
[03:03:31.832 --> 03:03:34.292]  The borders are completely wide open.
[03:03:34.292 --> 03:03:37.913]  Tens of millions of people are flooding here as we speak.
[03:03:37.913 --> 03:03:44.834]  Hundreds of thousands a month pouring over the borders, being given driver's license in California to pull the lever to ban guns.
[03:03:44.834 --> 03:03:49.835]  We are in the middle of a globalist revolution against this country right now.
[03:03:49.835 --> 03:03:51.756]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[03:03:51.756 --> 03:03:53.516]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[03:03:53.516 --> 03:03:55.456]  It's a depression.
[03:03:55.456 --> 03:03:58.337]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[03:03:59.744 --> 03:04:01.727]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[03:04:01.727 --> 03:04:02.808]  Banks are going bust.
[03:04:02.808 --> 03:04:05.392]  Shopkeepers keep a gun to the counter.
[03:04:05.392 --> 03:04:06.994]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[03:04:06.994 --> 03:04:09.898]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[03:04:09.898 --> 03:04:10.719]  We know.
[03:04:10.719 --> 03:04:13.883]  The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
[03:04:14.684 --> 03:04:23.449]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[03:04:23.449 --> 03:04:26.110]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:27.071]  They're crazy!
[03:04:27.071 --> 03:04:30.452]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore!
[03:04:30.452 --> 03:04:37.416]  We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms!
[03:04:37.416 --> 03:04:41.959]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios, and I won't say anything!
[03:04:41.959 --> 03:04:43.019]  Just leave us alone!
[03:04:43.019 --> 03:04:44.380]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone!
[03:04:45.257 --> 03:04:46.079]  I want you to get mad!
[03:04:57.765 --> 03:04:59.767]  InfoWars has made history.
[03:04:59.767 --> 03:05:02.389]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:05.572]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[03:05:05.572 --> 03:05:09.035]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[03:05:09.035 --> 03:05:10.576]  Let's win the war.
[03:05:10.576 --> 03:05:12.338]  The information war.
[03:05:12.338 --> 03:05:17.122]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping InfoWars on air and the fight for liberty.
[03:05:17.122 --> 03:05:18.924]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[03:05:19.184 --> 03:05:30.868]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[03:05:50.741 --> 03:05:51.782]  Thank you for your support.
[03:06:04.071 --> 03:06:08.453]  A poll went up on Infowars.com this morning.
[03:06:08.453 --> 03:06:11.975]  It's got 15,700 votes as of a few minutes ago when I printed this off.
[03:06:11.975 --> 03:06:15.256]  And we asked, what issue is most concerned to you right now?
[03:06:15.256 --> 03:06:19.878]  Illegal immigration, economy, censorship, medical tyranny?
[03:06:33.300 --> 03:06:38.742]  Illegal immigration was 26 percent, economy 25, citizenship 11, medical tyranny 37.
[03:06:38.742 --> 03:06:54.328]  And whoever the crew put that up, it's a good poll, but I would have just added the other point of the war in Ukraine leading to nuclear war with the doomsday clock moved by the International Committee to 90 seconds to total Armageddon.
[03:06:54.328 --> 03:06:57.229]  But I would ask our next guest, what does he think is a bigger issue, the medical tyranny
[03:06:58.112 --> 03:07:00.353]  Or the world marching towards thermonuclear war?
[03:07:00.353 --> 03:07:06.595]  And I think both of them are the same subject of an establishment that's gone quite mad.
[03:07:06.595 --> 03:07:26.441]  Well, we've had a lot of big guests on here, but of the top two or three people that from the beginning have exposed this, the guy that first, well over two years ago, that specifically predicted everything was going to happen, filed emergency motions, the European Union Parliament that I saw with Wolfgang Wudarg and others, was Dr. Michael Yedon, and he couldn't have a better
[03:07:27.139 --> 03:07:31.180]  Curriculum vitae or a background.
[03:07:31.180 --> 03:07:34.081]  Dr. Gidon is a professional research scientist.
[03:07:34.081 --> 03:07:42.143]  He's a lifelong career in big pharma and biotech R&D, preceded by training with joint first-class honors in biochemistry and toxicology.
[03:07:42.143 --> 03:07:46.244]  Also did three years of research based on impact of opiates on receptors.
[03:07:46.244 --> 03:07:50.545]  Even more noteworthy is that he used the fentanyl class of synthetic opiates
[03:07:51.969 --> 03:07:57.632]  Invented at Janssen Labs, now part of Johnson & Johnson, which places him in a unique position to offer expert testimony as well.
[03:07:57.632 --> 03:08:01.934]  He has trained and practiced research across a wide range of relevant life sciences.
[03:08:01.934 --> 03:08:08.677]  For 40 years he retired, what, four years ago or so, or you can correct me, from Pfizer as their vice president, one of their main directors.
[03:08:08.677 --> 03:08:13.200]  I'm gonna let him give you his background so I don't get it wrong, but you couldn't have a more credentialed
[03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:19.468]  Individual, and I'd call him literally establishment whistleblower, then Dr. Michael Yedon.
[03:08:19.468 --> 03:08:28.661]  I'm going to do my best because we have millions of people tuned in to try to let him just lead this discussion where he wants to go here in the next 50 minutes we have.
[03:08:28.661 --> 03:08:29.903]  So Dr. Yedon, take it over.
[03:08:31.061 --> 03:08:32.263]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:08:32.263 --> 03:08:39.512]  It's a real privilege to speak to you and through you, hopefully to a large audience, some of whom have not heard from me before.
[03:08:39.512 --> 03:08:47.422]  So yes, I think it would be fair to say I'm the most qualified former pharmaceutical company executive
[03:08:48.062 --> 03:08:49.363]  Speaking anywhere in the world.
[03:08:49.363 --> 03:08:52.624]  That was true early in 2020, and it's still true now.
[03:08:52.624 --> 03:09:02.026]  Sadly, as you say, I have a proper training in biochemistry, toxicology, and then a research-based PhD on opiates and respiration.
[03:09:02.026 --> 03:09:09.569]  Then I spent 23 years in big pharma, leaving Pfizer as their vice president and worldwide head of respiratory research in 2011.
[03:09:11.234 --> 03:09:13.216]  And then I worked for 10 years in biotech.
[03:09:13.216 --> 03:09:15.517]  I founded a biotech company myself.
[03:09:15.517 --> 03:09:23.443]  I was the CEO and I led that through financing clinical trials and it was acquired by Novartis in 2017.
[03:09:23.443 --> 03:09:28.507]  So the point of saying this is I think I am the peer scientifically
[03:09:28.507 --> 03:09:29.248]  We're good to go.
[03:09:51.227 --> 03:09:59.411]  Very early on, March 2020, that basically we were under attack and I knew this for this reason.
[03:09:59.411 --> 03:10:13.537]  We had imposed upon us lockdowns, an absurd prison slang type of approach for which there was no precedent anywhere in public health.
[03:10:13.537 --> 03:10:15.778]  All right.
[03:10:15.778 --> 03:10:17.839]  Sorry sir, your Skype broke up for five seconds.
[03:10:17.839 --> 03:10:18.619]  Please continue.
[03:10:18.619 --> 03:10:18.799]  Okay.
[03:10:19.508 --> 03:10:29.973]  So, yeah, so basically the lockdown told us that there was a supranational plot, I'm afraid, to impose these measures upon us.
[03:10:29.973 --> 03:10:35.115]  And then if I just make three quick points, the first is we've been lied to.
[03:10:36.175 --> 03:10:46.179]  By government officials and corporate types about absolutely everything to do with this so-called virus pandemic.
[03:10:46.179 --> 03:10:58.383]  The severity of the public health threats, the necessity to lock down, asymptomatic transmission, the use of masks, mass testing and finally vaccines.
[03:10:58.923 --> 03:11:03.726]  Every single part of the narrative, every single part, is a lie.
[03:11:03.726 --> 03:11:05.407]  Scientifically proven.
[03:11:05.407 --> 03:11:15.393]  And I know that the people like Fauci, like Sympathetic Balance, were lying through the TVs to the audience because we share a common training.
[03:11:15.393 --> 03:11:19.015]  I trained at the same kind of universities at the same time.
[03:11:19.015 --> 03:11:20.016]  That meant we had the same
[03:11:20.655 --> 03:11:29.785]  Foundational training, for example, in immunology, and then when they said things I knew were not true, I knew that they knew that too, and that they were lying to you.
[03:11:29.785 --> 03:11:33.329]  And that was what kick-started me from very early on.
[03:11:34.517 --> 03:11:42.481]  Well, I'm not a famous, well-known scientist, top of your class like you, but I know basic things like learned immunity is better than artificial immunity.
[03:11:42.481 --> 03:11:44.062]  And then they said, no, that's not the case.
[03:11:44.062 --> 03:11:47.684]  Or they said this was a vaccine when it wasn't a classic vaccine.
[03:11:47.684 --> 03:11:54.688]  I mean, they were attacking therapeutics that the Pentagon had tested years ago and said were really good, but these type of viruses.
[03:11:54.688 --> 03:11:57.489]  So I was having the same concerns as a layperson.
[03:11:57.489 --> 03:12:02.272]  And then I saw your research and it really validated my basic understanding.
[03:12:03.334 --> 03:12:03.915]  No, you're right.
[03:12:03.915 --> 03:12:08.118]  And in fact, I've got a couple of phrases people told me were very powerful.
[03:12:08.118 --> 03:12:09.379]  Just threw them out there.
[03:12:09.379 --> 03:12:11.761]  So I've got this rhetorical question, Alex.
[03:12:11.761 --> 03:12:18.686]  What's the right number of times your public health officials should lie to you in a way that could cost you your health or your life?
[03:12:18.686 --> 03:12:19.787]  What's the right number?
[03:12:19.787 --> 03:12:22.309]  Now, I think the answer is zero, right?
[03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:26.052]  It shouldn't deliberately tell you things that they know to be untrue.
[03:12:26.052 --> 03:12:27.973]  Well, you've just listed three or four.
[03:12:27.973 --> 03:12:29.815]  I've found six, seven, eight.
[03:12:29.815 --> 03:12:31.416]  There is no question.
[03:12:31.416 --> 03:12:32.517]  These people are lying to
[03:12:33.198 --> 03:12:38.302]  When people lie to you, it's to hide something or to introduce something.
[03:12:38.302 --> 03:12:43.346]  And I think they are introducing these so-called vaccines.
[03:12:43.346 --> 03:12:52.634]  And while the lot cut to the chase, there was no necessity whatsoever to introduce something called a vaccine.
[03:12:52.634 --> 03:12:54.115]  Let me just explain why.
[03:12:54.115 --> 03:13:00.120]  The younger people, people my age, I'm 62, so a youngish fit person or younger,
[03:13:01.361 --> 03:13:05.423]  Almost none of them died of this so-called virus.
[03:13:05.423 --> 03:13:11.527]  So why would you want to vaccinate all the population when most people have got perfectly satisfactory immunity?
[03:13:11.527 --> 03:13:19.092]  So that was one thing and yet Bill Gates and others wanted a needle in every arm and they still want a needle in every arm.
[03:13:19.092 --> 03:13:22.475]  But I've got something even more fateful to the narrative.
[03:13:22.475 --> 03:13:24.596]  Most people will know that you're offered
[03:13:26.074 --> 03:13:28.557]  An annual flu vaccine.
[03:13:28.557 --> 03:13:41.930]  Well, the thing is, I had a look at the meta-analysis over a decade in the UK, and it turns out that flu vaccines do not reduce severe flu or deaths from flu in the UK.
[03:13:41.930 --> 03:13:44.012]  And I can tell you why they don't work.
[03:13:44.770 --> 03:13:52.193]  The reason that elderly, frail people are vulnerable is their immune system has slowed down and doesn't respond well to new challenges.
[03:13:52.193 --> 03:13:52.553]  Right?
[03:13:52.553 --> 03:13:54.394]  That sounds uncontroversial.
[03:13:54.394 --> 03:13:58.716]  Why in the world, Alex, would you think they'd respond well to vaccines?
[03:13:58.716 --> 03:13:59.957]  And they don't!
[03:13:59.957 --> 03:14:05.839]  So the people who get benefit don't need it, and the people who are at risk of death don't get the benefit.
[03:14:05.839 --> 03:14:08.080]  The whole thing is a lie.
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:11.782]  Don't go near these so-called vaccines, which I will talk about in depth.
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:25.471]  We've got a few minutes to break and we'll come back, but you've really called it years ago, it was happening, but you've now said, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but your own words, that this is a premeditated, poisonous or dangerous thing.
[03:14:25.471 --> 03:14:29.474]  Speak to how you know it's premeditated and then why would they do it?
[03:14:29.474 --> 03:14:31.155]  Why would they think they're going to get away with it?
[03:14:31.155 --> 03:14:33.998]  Because now it looks like they're not getting away with it thanks to you.
[03:14:35.430 --> 03:14:37.231]  Well, I'm not the only one.
[03:14:37.231 --> 03:14:42.974]  I think the main weapon they have against people like me, and you will know all about this, is censorship.
[03:14:42.974 --> 03:14:46.536]  I'm probably one of the most censored people.
[03:14:46.536 --> 03:14:51.799]  I've been ejected off Twitter and I've not been allowed back despite my appeals.
[03:14:51.799 --> 03:14:56.862]  I can't comment under a YouTube video or post any, they get deleted in real time as I type them.
[03:14:57.502 --> 03:15:03.127]  I can't, you know, if you Google me, you'll find I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[03:15:03.127 --> 03:15:10.693]  But if you use something like Yandex, which is a Russian browser, you will find 80 interviews by me.
[03:15:10.693 --> 03:15:17.898]  So, you know, so basically they're not frightened of people like me because they figure that I won't be heard.
[03:15:17.898 --> 03:15:18.579]  So here's the thing.
[03:15:19.159 --> 03:15:27.488]  Please, listener, what I ask you to do is memorise two or three of the most powerful things I told you.
[03:15:27.488 --> 03:15:30.651]  Please, you must go and tell ten other people.
[03:15:30.651 --> 03:15:31.852]  Please don't tell me it's hard.
[03:15:31.852 --> 03:15:32.653]  I know it's hard.
[03:15:32.653 --> 03:15:34.815]  I've been trying to do this film for almost three years.
[03:15:34.815 --> 03:15:38.479]  But the only way we'll win is if you tell ten other people.
[03:15:38.479 --> 03:15:40.221]  The mass media is never going to tell them.
[03:15:40.681 --> 03:15:40.901]  Right?
[03:15:40.901 --> 03:15:42.322]  They're never going to tell them.
[03:15:42.322 --> 03:15:43.823]  And they weren't working out on their own.
[03:15:43.823 --> 03:15:45.443]  They're still in the narrative.
[03:15:45.443 --> 03:15:45.904]  Well, that's right.
[03:15:45.904 --> 03:15:46.264]  Stay there.
[03:15:46.264 --> 03:15:47.404]  That's so powerful, though.
[03:15:47.404 --> 03:15:48.645]  The people have to mobilize.
[03:15:48.645 --> 03:15:49.285]  They tell 10.
[03:15:49.285 --> 03:15:49.625]  They tell 10.
[03:15:49.625 --> 03:15:50.866]  Tell them, tell 10.
[03:15:50.866 --> 03:15:51.666]  Chain reaction.
[03:15:51.666 --> 03:15:52.587]  Stay there, Dr. Michael Udom.
[03:15:52.587 --> 03:15:57.349]  We'll come right back.
[03:15:57.349 --> 03:16:00.491]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[03:16:00.491 --> 03:16:03.012]  If we're so stupid, we let them tell us.
[03:16:03.012 --> 03:16:04.853]  We deserve it.
[03:16:04.853 --> 03:16:08.715]  Except children don't deserve it, do they?
[03:16:10.476 --> 03:16:30.412]  And I looked and behold a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[03:16:30.412 --> 03:16:34.335]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse
[03:16:36.297 --> 03:16:40.139]  And his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[03:16:40.139 --> 03:16:44.300]  The Book of Revelation.
[03:16:44.300 --> 03:16:45.961]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[03:16:45.961 --> 03:16:47.682]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[03:16:47.682 --> 03:16:49.242]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[03:16:49.242 --> 03:16:50.603]  This is our fight.
[03:16:50.603 --> 03:16:51.944]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[03:16:51.944 --> 03:16:53.404]  The Globalists even admit it's leaked.
[03:16:53.404 --> 03:16:57.726]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:16:57.726 --> 03:17:04.289]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.

[03:17:57.332 --> 03:18:01.436]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[03:18:02.077 --> 03:18:07.281]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[03:18:07.281 --> 03:18:12.145]  And InfoWars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[03:18:12.145 --> 03:18:17.089]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[03:18:17.089 --> 03:18:26.116]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[03:18:26.596 --> 03:18:39.591]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[03:18:39.591 --> 03:18:43.535]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[03:18:44.416 --> 03:18:44.997]  300%.
[03:18:44.997 --> 03:18:48.080]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:54.366]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[03:18:54.366 --> 03:18:57.489]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[03:18:57.489 --> 03:19:02.854]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[03:19:03.715 --> 03:19:12.101]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[03:19:12.101 --> 03:19:14.343]  So I thank you for your passion for support.
[03:19:14.343 --> 03:19:21.188]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin, the final coin that we're putting out for a long time.
[03:19:21.775 --> 03:19:25.078]  Yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[03:19:37.988 --> 03:19:43.771]  The coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[03:19:43.771 --> 03:19:55.138]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[03:19:55.138 --> 03:19:58.640]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:19:58.640 --> 03:20:04.523]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:26.925]  I've been following Dr. Michael Yeadon for almost three years and totally admiring him.
[03:20:26.925 --> 03:20:28.826]  And of course I get his name wrong and say Yeadon.
[03:20:28.826 --> 03:20:30.286]  It's Yeadon.
[03:20:30.286 --> 03:20:35.468]  And we've got until the end of the hour and I really want him to just know he has the floor and laser focus on
[03:20:36.152 --> 03:20:50.303]  What he saw, he's already on his curriculum, the background, his predictions that came exactly true in that emergency filing he did in the EU in December of 2000 that was so powerful, the predicted blood clots, the heart attacks, the myocarditis, the infertility.
[03:20:51.513 --> 03:20:58.759]  And then now the vindication is all this comes out as it confirmed, and then where does he see this needs to go to bring justice to these people?
[03:20:58.759 --> 03:21:05.644]  Because he's right, the censorship day one is what allowed them to get away with this attack.
[03:21:05.644 --> 03:21:10.408]  It's obviously bringing their global social credit score, their vaccine passports, all of that.
[03:21:10.408 --> 03:21:11.589]  So sir, please continue.
[03:21:12.529 --> 03:21:13.569]  Yeah, no, certainly.
[03:21:13.569 --> 03:21:21.793]  You asked me before the break how I was so sure that this was deliberate rather than some sort of accidental overreaction.
[03:21:21.793 --> 03:21:28.216]  Well, what I can tell you is that the this idea of telling us that there's a pandemic.
[03:21:29.108 --> 03:21:32.894]  And using coordinated media to terrify people in every country.
[03:21:32.894 --> 03:21:38.582]  And then, as you said, using the lockdown, a kind of prison term.
[03:21:38.582 --> 03:21:42.187]  That didn't just get worked out in the first quarter of 2020.
[03:21:43.550 --> 03:22:05.724]  I didn't realize till about a year, but at least 10 rehearsals have taken place and I prompted your researchers to look and pick up a video by a German journalist called Paul Schreier, S-C-H-R-E-Y-E-R, on YouTube, surprisingly, called Pandemic Simulations, Preparation for a New Era.
[03:22:05.724 --> 03:22:11.907]  They have been running simulations of worldwide pandemics, mostly respiratory disease, since 1997.
[03:22:13.887 --> 03:22:22.113]  And they've involved every country and institution, including coming up to the Bill Gates-sponsored event 201 at the end of 2019.
[03:22:22.113 --> 03:22:24.995]  They've rehearsed this again and again and again and again.
[03:22:24.995 --> 03:22:29.117]  That tells me it's deliberate, that they intended to execute this plan.
[03:22:29.117 --> 03:22:30.238]  That's the first thing to say.
[03:22:30.238 --> 03:22:35.622]  And then the second thing, like I've said, is all the things they told us about the virus were lies.
[03:22:35.622 --> 03:22:36.643]  Absolutely everything.
[03:22:36.643 --> 03:22:38.484]  It's not very serious.
[03:22:38.484 --> 03:22:39.985]  It doesn't kill many people.
[03:22:39.985 --> 03:22:42.406]  Children are not faintly at risk, and so on.
[03:22:43.467 --> 03:22:44.648]  That's one thing.
[03:23:01.019 --> 03:23:01.319]  I think.
[03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:20.933]  Vaccination is the wrong strategy for any new outbreak like this.
[03:23:20.933 --> 03:23:22.475]  It should always be early treatment.
[03:23:37.632 --> 03:23:38.573]  So what are they doing?
[03:23:38.573 --> 03:23:39.654]  They've lied.
[03:23:39.654 --> 03:23:50.741]  They're going forward with a strategy that I've just explained as an expert could not possibly work, does not work in the case of flu, and yet they've injected I think five and a half billion people.
[03:23:54.602 --> 03:24:21.836]  And then I'm going to tell you, I don't know why other people aren't saying it in the industry, if you introduce to the human body mRNA, basically wrapped in lipid, which is like the Pfizer and Moderna products, if they get expressed, taken up in your body, you hijack the manufacturing machinery in your body, and you make whatever's encoded, Alex, you will turn yourself into a virus, protein, or foreign protein factory.
[03:24:22.603 --> 03:24:24.005]  This is terrible.
[03:24:24.005 --> 03:24:28.969]  Your body demarks the inside and keeps it as self.
[03:24:28.969 --> 03:24:30.551]  And the outside is non-self.
[03:24:30.551 --> 03:24:33.994]  And when they mix, you get an immune reaction.
[03:24:33.994 --> 03:24:44.345]  So when the shot skips the sinus and your body's first line of defense is it goes in, explain this, you're a scientist, it programs your cells to make the spike protein similar to prions, right?
[03:24:47.095 --> 03:24:52.778]  Not necessarily, but the main thing is they're making a protein that does not belong in your body.
[03:24:52.778 --> 03:25:00.101]  Your body notices that those cells and tissues are expressing non-self.
[03:25:00.101 --> 03:25:05.904]  Your immune soldiers are platoon, heavy weapons, go to work, and their job is to destroy that cell.
[03:25:05.904 --> 03:25:08.745]  That's how they stop you getting cancer every day.
[03:25:08.745 --> 03:25:14.308]  If there's a single cell that goes aberrant, tumorous... So they know, they know that it's going to cause an autoimmune response to the body?
[03:25:15.399 --> 03:25:16.760]  Definitely.
[03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:17.860]  Every time.
[03:25:17.860 --> 03:25:31.707]  And here's the worst part, the thing that's... I mean, I wish it didn't, but things keep confirming what I guessed in 2020, which was this is totalitarian control and ultimately they're going to depopulate, which sounds crazy.
[03:25:31.707 --> 03:25:35.929]  I was the sort of person who listened to the BBC and read the Times newspaper until 2020.
[03:25:36.949 --> 03:25:44.311]  I have no history of involvement in unusual campaigns, and I probably would have chuckled at conspiracy theorists.
[03:25:44.311 --> 03:25:45.631]  Present company accepted.
[03:25:45.631 --> 03:25:46.851]  But I'm now joining you.
[03:25:46.851 --> 03:25:53.073]  It's absolutely obvious that if you inject people with mRNA, it doesn't matter what it encodes for.
[03:25:53.073 --> 03:25:54.573]  What did we hear a month ago?
[03:25:54.573 --> 03:25:59.214]  The pharmaceutical companies are re-manufacturing
[03:26:01.970 --> 03:26:29.453]  In MRNA form and they've ordered or there are business terms with each government force to buy 10 injections per man woman and baby in every country and I can assure you you could not possibly stand up to 10 of these injections but I can see how easily they could put us in a position where you get no choice so just cutting to the chase what I think is going to happen I wish I wasn't being right I think they will make a
[03:26:30.473 --> 03:26:32.714]  Digital ID mandatory.
[03:26:32.714 --> 03:26:34.835]  Not necessarily vaccine passport, but that would do.
[03:26:34.835 --> 03:26:36.976]  Digital ID will become mandatory.
[03:26:36.976 --> 03:26:41.358]  You will not be able to shop or travel or work without it or get health care.
[03:26:41.358 --> 03:26:47.640]  And I think the other thing they'll do is withdraw cash and replace all currency with central bank digital currencies.
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:56.944]  At that point, Alex, if they say, if you don't get your next jab, we will not allow you to buy gasoline or travel or buy food.
[03:26:57.864 --> 03:27:00.025]  The system I've just described is trivial.
[03:27:00.025 --> 03:27:01.806]  It's already ready to go.
[03:27:01.806 --> 03:27:04.628]  So I say to people, use cash.
[03:27:04.628 --> 03:27:08.289]  Diversify the businesses you buy from.
[03:27:08.289 --> 03:27:12.471]  Any business that won't take cash, tell them you're not going to work with them anymore.
[03:27:12.471 --> 03:27:15.533]  And for goodness sake, tell people.
[03:27:15.533 --> 03:27:17.454]  I don't care if it might be a little embarrassing.
[03:27:17.454 --> 03:27:21.896]  I can assure you what I've been doing for the last few years has not enhanced my reputation.
[03:27:22.456 --> 03:27:25.018]  With people I used to work with, the cowards.
[03:27:25.018 --> 03:27:26.419]  I'll call them out again.
[03:27:26.419 --> 03:27:29.241]  Patrick Vallance, you're a liar.
[03:27:29.241 --> 03:27:34.065]  Mattai Mammon, who was the head of R&D at Johnson & Johnson.
[03:27:34.065 --> 03:27:38.948]  I told him that he should resign before he gets imprisoned, and he's resigned.
[03:27:38.948 --> 03:27:42.431]  He resigned making no announcement as to the reason why.
[03:27:42.431 --> 03:27:43.411]  Who else?
[03:27:43.411 --> 03:27:46.293]  Manny Pangolos at AstraZeneca, you're a criminal.
[03:27:46.293 --> 03:27:50.476]  You need to sue me, otherwise everyone will know what I've just said is true.
[03:27:52.389 --> 03:28:03.117]  Every person who's injected with a product that contains messenger RNA that codes for something that doesn't belong in your body will induce an autoimmune reaction.
[03:28:03.117 --> 03:28:05.539]  So here's the thing, this I think will resonate.
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:07.802]  No one else has said this.
[03:28:07.802 --> 03:28:12.888]  Have you noticed that there's a wide range of side effects from the existing mRNA vaccines?
[03:28:12.888 --> 03:28:20.818]  Myocarditis, neurological conditions, brain blood clots, deep vein thrombosis and so on.
[03:28:20.818 --> 03:28:21.699]  I think I know why.
[03:28:22.319 --> 03:28:28.622]  When you get injected with one of these materials, they don't deposit evenly around the body.
[03:28:28.622 --> 03:28:32.264]  Sometimes more of it will go to one vascular bed than another.
[03:28:32.264 --> 03:28:37.747]  So if it goes mostly to your heart, I think those are the people who've got myocarditis.
[03:28:37.747 --> 03:28:38.968]  Stay there, this is too important.
[03:28:38.968 --> 03:28:40.349]  Longer segment coming up.
[03:28:40.349 --> 03:28:41.949]  Incredibly important information.
[03:28:41.949 --> 03:28:44.811]  Dr. Michael Yeadon, stay right there.
[03:28:44.811 --> 03:28:46.532]  Oh man, this is so important.
[03:28:46.532 --> 03:28:48.553]  And it's all been vindicated, everything he said has come true.
[03:28:49.113 --> 03:28:51.395]  We're going to talk about it all and what he believes is coming next.
[03:28:51.395 --> 03:28:54.278]  We're going to stop this takeover, this biomedical tyranny together.
[03:28:54.278 --> 03:28:57.340]  Stay with us.
[03:28:57.340 --> 03:29:01.864]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[03:29:01.864 --> 03:29:14.315]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[03:29:14.315 --> 03:29:15.516]  These are high-end.
[03:29:15.516 --> 03:29:16.557]  These are the very best.
[03:29:16.877 --> 03:29:19.359]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[03:29:19.359 --> 03:29:19.880]  Well, guess what?
[03:29:19.880 --> 03:29:25.666]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[03:29:25.666 --> 03:29:28.288]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[03:29:28.288 --> 03:29:35.175]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[03:29:35.175 --> 03:29:40.400]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:40.400 --> 03:29:41.361]  The highest quality.
[03:29:41.721 --> 03:29:50.803]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:22.676]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[03:30:22.676 --> 03:30:34.504]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:30:34.504 --> 03:30:36.045]  This is why they attack us.
[03:30:36.525 --> 03:30:39.046]  This is why we need your support.
[03:30:39.046 --> 03:30:40.847]  Because we tell the truth.
[03:30:40.847 --> 03:30:43.048]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:43.048 --> 03:30:44.489]  Join the resistance.
[03:30:44.489 --> 03:30:45.790]  Buy products.

[03:31:09.697 --> 03:31:11.458]  The information war.
[03:31:11.458 --> 03:31:13.420]  There's nothing you can do more important
[03:31:13.720 --> 03:31:14.460]  We're good to go.

[03:32:58.570 --> 03:33:04.472]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.742 --> 03:33:20.307]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.307 --> 03:33:23.569]  Well, this is such life-saving information.
[03:33:23.569 --> 03:33:25.010]  Dr. Mike Keenan is our guest.
[03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:28.953]  I would invite him back for a commercial-free podcast that we tape on Saturdays.
[03:33:28.953 --> 03:33:31.975]  We can tape at any time, but those are usually at about 2-3 million views.
[03:33:32.739 --> 03:33:34.241]  People love those commercial-free podcasts.
[03:33:34.241 --> 03:33:36.244]  That way he can even send us a PowerPoint if he wants.
[03:33:36.244 --> 03:33:37.726]  We can put slides up there.
[03:33:37.726 --> 03:33:40.530]  He can do a whole presentation without me even talking.
[03:33:40.530 --> 03:33:41.892]  But we ran another break, sir.
[03:33:41.892 --> 03:33:44.436]  You're trying to make a point that was really key as we went to break.
[03:33:45.911 --> 03:33:47.331]  Yeah, sure, thank you.
[03:33:47.331 --> 03:33:56.234]  I was talking just before the break that when a person's injected with one of these mRNA so-called vaccines, they don't distribute evenly around the body.
[03:33:56.234 --> 03:33:58.414]  There'll be kind of lumpy distribution.
[03:33:58.414 --> 03:34:14.438]  And so I believe that wherever it lands in your body, in the heart or blood vessels in the brain or in your legs, whatever, if it gets taken up and expressed there, you end up showing non-self to your immune system, which comes in and destroys that tissue.
[03:34:15.533 --> 03:34:16.613]  Maybe cell by cell.
[03:34:16.613 --> 03:34:18.415]  It won't kill you on day one.
[03:34:18.415 --> 03:34:23.059]  That's why people get progressive illness quite often, and they're just constantly sick.
[03:34:23.059 --> 03:34:24.280]  So here's the thing.
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:29.984]  If you get a lot of deposition in the heart, you'll get myocarditis or pericarditis.
[03:34:29.984 --> 03:34:42.655]  If you get a lot of distribution in your brain or spinal cord or peripheral nervous system, any one of a number of horrible neurological conditions that you've seen, people shaking uncontrollably and so on, if it lands in the back of your eye,
[03:34:43.385 --> 03:34:47.768]  You'll get loss of vision suddenly in one eye and that's happened to two people I know.
[03:34:47.768 --> 03:34:49.609]  What else?
[03:34:49.609 --> 03:34:53.111]  If it lands in your ovaries, infertility.
[03:34:53.111 --> 03:34:58.054]  Your immune system will destroy the egg cells in your ovary.
[03:34:58.054 --> 03:35:03.638]  If it lands in pregnant uterus, stillbirth or premature delivery.
[03:35:03.638 --> 03:35:05.139]  So you get the point.
[03:35:05.139 --> 03:35:08.381]  What I've told you explains all the effects.
[03:35:08.381 --> 03:35:10.382]  The fact that people aren't becoming ill and dying.
[03:35:11.443 --> 03:35:15.986]  And the huge diversity of adverse events that they are just ignoring.
[03:35:15.986 --> 03:35:22.070]  It's all clearly there in public databases like VAERS in the US, very good system.
[03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:26.273]  The military has a similar system, shows same pattern.
[03:35:26.273 --> 03:35:28.115]  Yellow card and so on.
[03:35:28.115 --> 03:35:34.679]  Everywhere in the world, honest public health officials can see what I'm saying is true, but they're just lying, lying, lying.
[03:35:34.679 --> 03:35:39.623]  And the insurance company actuaries are showing a massive increase in death never before seen, correct?
[03:35:40.629 --> 03:35:42.470]  They are, absolutely.
[03:35:42.470 --> 03:35:44.870]  And then when people say, oh, well, it's COVID.
[03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:46.051]  No, it isn't.
[03:35:46.051 --> 03:35:49.692]  The people who are dying now are the people who've been injected.
[03:35:49.692 --> 03:35:57.394]  And a lot of those people are young and middle-aged people, which is why lots of workforces have enormous sickness absence rates at the moment.
[03:35:57.394 --> 03:35:57.954]  So you're right.
[03:35:57.954 --> 03:36:02.775]  The life insurance excess claims is for the working age population.
[03:36:02.775 --> 03:36:08.357]  They're not the people who typically would have perished with flu at 80 or 90 years of age.
[03:36:08.357 --> 03:36:09.117]  It's young people.
[03:36:09.617 --> 03:36:17.959]  It's all around the world, almost without exception, where Covid-19 vaccines have been rained upon the population.
[03:36:17.959 --> 03:36:24.280]  And again, just a quick point so that people will know you're being lied to.
[03:36:24.280 --> 03:36:29.361]  So, for example, we were told it's safe to give to pregnant women.
[03:36:29.361 --> 03:36:33.002]  Well, I can tell you, 60 years of experience since thalidomide,
[03:36:33.783 --> 03:36:37.864]  Has that produced a red line that operated all the way through my career?
[03:36:37.864 --> 03:36:42.246]  You never give experimental medical interventions to a pregnant woman, Alex.
[03:36:42.246 --> 03:36:43.766]  You never do it.
[03:36:43.766 --> 03:36:50.868]  Even if it might save her life, you still have to have that argument about whether it's worth risking birth malformations or killing the fetus.
[03:36:50.868 --> 03:36:52.049]  That's one group.
[03:36:52.049 --> 03:36:56.350]  We never should inject people who already apparently had this disorder.
[03:36:56.990 --> 03:37:03.293]  As you said, immunity from prior illness of the same type is the strongest defence.
[03:37:03.293 --> 03:37:05.914]  And then thirdly, we should never inject children.
[03:37:05.914 --> 03:37:09.816]  Not one of them in Europe died because of this so-called virus.
[03:37:09.816 --> 03:37:11.677]  So they're chasing pregnant women.
[03:37:12.257 --> 03:37:18.682]  Your children or grandchildren, and they're chasing you if you've not been jabbed, even if you think you've had it already.
[03:37:18.682 --> 03:37:23.026]  These guys are literally, they are psychopaths at this point.
[03:37:23.026 --> 03:37:32.032]  And one thing I wanted to mention, people might say, well, you know, if it wasn't as bad as you say, you know, this virus and it wasn't an emergency, how did they all die?
[03:37:32.032 --> 03:37:34.955]  And I can tell you, medical murder.
[03:37:34.955 --> 03:37:36.576]  I mean, it's absolutely shocking.
[03:37:36.676 --> 03:37:40.538]  And by the way, since you're a world-leading expert in opiates and drugs for surgery,
[03:38:04.273 --> 03:38:17.098]  I forget the name of the drug but I saw it in the UK that the government stocked up on before COVID and that they gave patients that had COVID and were on respirators but the drug was known to kill respiration.
[03:38:17.098 --> 03:38:17.618]  What was that drug?
[03:38:18.577 --> 03:38:25.520]  Yeah, that's called Midazolam, and the mixture of Midazolam, which is like a granddaddy of Valium.
[03:38:25.520 --> 03:38:28.941]  So it's a real strong sedative, the Midazolam.
[03:38:28.941 --> 03:38:33.443]  And they were also giving them morphine, which is like a fentanyl-type drug.
[03:38:33.443 --> 03:38:35.524]  Midazolam, morphine and remdesivir.
[03:38:35.524 --> 03:38:39.145]  But here's the thing, they were also giving them mechanical ventilation.
[03:38:39.805 --> 03:38:46.891]  What you would not be expected to know and the public should not be expected to know because they think of mechanical ventilation as life-saving.
[03:38:46.891 --> 03:38:53.015]  Well sure it is if you've come in with a road traffic accident or if you happen to have open chest surgery.
[03:38:53.015 --> 03:38:56.358]  But I tell you what in my 30 years experience we never
[03:38:56.598 --> 03:38:58.801]  If you're breathless, you need oxygen.
[03:39:14.285 --> 03:39:21.572]  But you definitely don't want to be sevated, intubated and ventilated because that on its own is incredibly aggressive to an elderly person.
[03:39:21.572 --> 03:39:26.336]  And then they whacked IV remdesivir, midazolam and morphine.
[03:39:26.336 --> 03:39:28.618]  And they did it at higher doses than usual.
[03:39:28.618 --> 03:39:29.359]  It's not hidden.
[03:39:29.359 --> 03:39:32.242]  It was globally standardized.
[03:39:33.103 --> 03:39:36.267]  Even the UN had meetings and said we're told what to do by Big Pharma.
[03:39:36.267 --> 03:39:47.563]  So Big Pharma got together these confabs, decided the policy, did the drills beforehand, suppressed therapeutics, suppressed speech, suppressed the truth, and then rolled something out, as you said, that's premeditated murder.
[03:39:50.211 --> 03:39:52.532]  Yeah, there's no question, there is no question about it.
[03:39:52.532 --> 03:39:56.913]  And you might say, well, or people might say, well, surely the doctors would know this is not right.
[03:39:56.913 --> 03:40:10.218]  No, only a small percentage of people like the ER people or people who are skilled in acute medicine would understand what I just said, that mechanical ventilation in the right place is life saving and a miracle for everybody else.
[03:40:10.218 --> 03:40:15.099]  Stay away from it and giving it to elderly people without obstructed airways.
[03:40:15.099 --> 03:40:16.600]  They just have flu like illness.
[03:40:17.180 --> 03:40:20.661]  So you should give them, um, you should give them oxygen and calm them down.
[03:40:20.661 --> 03:40:24.582]  Seriously, Doctor, the time we have, and I could have it back for 10 hours, but you were so gracious to join us.
[03:40:24.582 --> 03:40:26.823]  We've got a few minutes to break.
[03:40:26.823 --> 03:40:29.464]  Just 35,000 foot view, and I want you to say it in your own words.
[03:40:29.464 --> 03:40:38.747]  You were on a show about a month ago, we played it a lot, and you said, look, I didn't really believe in God or any of this, but looking at this, it makes you know there's organized evil.
[03:40:38.747 --> 03:40:41.648]  Can you, in your own words, elaborate on that and restate that?
[03:40:42.839 --> 03:40:44.641]  Yes, I certainly can.
[03:40:44.641 --> 03:40:46.303]  I've looked very hard.
[03:40:46.303 --> 03:40:49.266]  People always ask me, why are they doing it?
[03:40:49.266 --> 03:40:56.374]  And they claim there's a necessity to reduce the population because the world is overpopulated.
[03:40:56.374 --> 03:40:57.695]  It's not true.
[03:40:57.695 --> 03:41:03.682]  If you look at the density of people on the planet and the rate of growth now is almost here, it's almost flattened out.
[03:41:04.642 --> 03:41:08.823]  People like Musk have said the biggest problem in 50 years is a falling population.
[03:41:08.823 --> 03:41:09.983]  So rule that one out.
[03:41:09.983 --> 03:41:11.544]  We're not overpopulated.
[03:41:11.544 --> 03:41:14.645]  We're also not running out of so-called fossil fuels.
[03:41:14.645 --> 03:41:16.545]  There's loads of coal and oil.
[03:41:16.545 --> 03:41:19.826]  And the climate, we are not destroying the climate.
[03:41:19.826 --> 03:41:23.387]  They've had 50 years worth of lies on that front.
[03:41:23.387 --> 03:41:24.847]  So I've ruled out
[03:41:25.989 --> 03:41:31.895]  The things I would like there to be a reason, and I get to the conclusion that they're doing it because, one, because they can.
[03:41:31.895 --> 03:41:34.617]  I think they've been planning it for decades.
[03:41:34.617 --> 03:41:39.001]  And secondly, I think they believe it's their, I don't know, birthright.
[03:41:39.001 --> 03:41:41.203]  But I do believe it's diabolical.
[03:41:41.203 --> 03:41:42.324]  It's not science-based.
[03:41:42.324 --> 03:41:45.607]  These people, they want control, and they're quite happy to.
[03:41:45.607 --> 03:41:50.391]  I think they're going to kill 90% of the population if we don't stop them.
[03:41:50.391 --> 03:41:51.452]  But here's the point.
[03:41:51.452 --> 03:41:52.453]  One of the ways they'll do it,
[03:41:53.033 --> 03:41:56.734]  The WHO, I think, is a horrible organisation.
[03:41:56.734 --> 03:41:58.934]  It's not really anything to do with health.
[03:41:58.934 --> 03:42:18.679]  They are trying at the moment, folks, to get all the countries of the world to sign updated international health regulations whereby, in the events of public health emergency of international concern, then Tedros, the head of the WHO, I'm not kidding you here, will have legal autonomy, legal power
[03:42:19.474 --> 03:42:25.080]  To set health policy in your country, in the US, in Europe, in the UK.
[03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:28.784]  And they're close to doing it, the international health regulations.
[03:42:28.784 --> 03:42:36.233]  But I should point out to you that even if you trusted the WHO, it's mad to centralise power.
[03:42:36.853 --> 03:42:38.474]  When you're facing a new challenge.
[03:42:38.474 --> 03:42:41.996]  How have humans solved new challenges?
[03:42:41.996 --> 03:42:44.618]  The answer is they've done lots of different experiments.
[03:42:44.618 --> 03:42:46.559]  A different community... You're totally right.
[03:42:46.559 --> 03:42:46.939]  Stay there.
[03:42:46.939 --> 03:42:48.880]  Final segment under my lead on Amazing.
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:50.101]  It's a long segment.
[03:42:50.101 --> 03:42:51.542]  I'm going to try to just shut up and give you the floor.
[03:42:51.542 --> 03:42:52.543]  So much to cover.
[03:42:52.543 --> 03:42:53.863]  Everybody, we need to share this interview.
[03:42:53.863 --> 03:42:57.426]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:57.426 --> 03:42:58.867]  Well, I just want to say... Fantastic stuff.
[03:43:00.356 --> 03:43:02.198]  Diet force is amazing!
[03:43:02.198 --> 03:43:07.782]  I'm 45 and I have bits, I go to the gym and I have bits that won't move.
[03:43:07.782 --> 03:43:10.385]  And diet force has helped me move those bits.
[03:43:10.385 --> 03:43:16.730]  Like, under my pecs, my belly, I'm just taking diet force two tablets a day.
[03:43:16.730 --> 03:43:18.952]  Man, if you're like struggling to get
[03:43:20.111 --> 03:43:22.952]  Like, chip shake for the ladies, mate.
[03:43:22.952 --> 03:43:25.113]  Diet Force is the go.
[03:43:25.113 --> 03:43:28.014]  You have to get the Diet Force and have it to a day.
[03:43:28.014 --> 03:43:29.775]  And just keep at it.
[03:43:29.775 --> 03:43:31.275]  Infowarsstore.com.

[03:43:43.539 --> 03:43:44.660]  We'll be right back, folks.
[03:43:44.660 --> 03:43:45.280]  Don't go anywhere.

[03:43:46.981 --> 03:43:47.401]  Get it now.
[03:43:57.293 --> 03:44:03.458]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[03:44:03.458 --> 03:44:16.469]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarStore.com right now and taking action.
[03:44:16.469 --> 03:44:21.413]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[03:44:21.813 --> 03:44:23.454]  Steve, InfoWars on the air.
[03:44:23.454 --> 03:44:25.756]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[03:44:25.756 --> 03:44:27.217]  They're coming for you and your family.
[03:44:27.217 --> 03:44:28.478]  They're coming for me.
[03:44:28.478 --> 03:44:29.719]  They're coming for the children.
[03:44:29.719 --> 03:44:32.281]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[03:44:32.281 --> 03:44:35.664]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[03:44:35.664 --> 03:44:36.965]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[03:44:37.205 --> 03:44:39.307]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[03:44:39.307 --> 03:44:44.732]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[03:44:44.732 --> 03:44:48.655]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[03:44:48.655 --> 03:44:49.856]  Let's do it together.
[03:44:49.856 --> 03:44:52.158]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[03:44:52.158 --> 03:44:55.982]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:55.982 --> 03:44:56.943]  Now take action now!
[03:45:05.970 --> 03:45:07.612]  Hey, what's up, Paul?
[03:45:07.612 --> 03:45:08.553]  Hey, McBreen.
[03:45:08.553 --> 03:45:10.555]  What's going on, man?
[03:45:10.555 --> 03:45:13.658]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece.
[03:45:13.658 --> 03:45:14.899]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[03:45:14.899 --> 03:45:16.200]  Right on, I worked hard on that.
[03:45:16.200 --> 03:45:21.966]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[03:45:21.966 --> 03:45:25.770]  Oh, um, no.
[03:45:25.770 --> 03:45:27.291]  No, nothing.
[03:45:27.291 --> 03:45:28.733]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[03:45:34.628 --> 03:45:36.049]  No.
[03:45:36.049 --> 03:45:36.810]  Hmm.
[03:45:36.810 --> 03:45:37.570]  Okay.
[03:45:37.570 --> 03:45:38.511]  Yeah.
[03:45:38.511 --> 03:45:39.231]  Thanks anyway.
[03:45:39.231 --> 03:45:39.411]  Yeah.
[03:45:39.411 --> 03:45:45.596]  Good luck with that project though.
[03:45:45.596 --> 03:45:51.580]  Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:57.045 --> 03:46:01.789]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[03:46:01.789 --> 03:46:06.993]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[03:46:06.993 --> 03:46:11.857]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[03:46:11.857 --> 03:46:16.781]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[03:46:16.781 --> 03:46:25.829]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[03:46:26.289 --> 03:46:39.304]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[03:46:39.304 --> 03:46:43.248]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD,
[03:46:43.949 --> 03:46:45.250]  Three hundred percent.
[03:46:45.250 --> 03:46:47.791]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[03:46:47.791 --> 03:46:54.073]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[03:46:54.073 --> 03:46:58.655]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[03:46:58.655 --> 03:47:04.557]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:09.047 --> 03:47:16.896]  Alright, final segment with Dr. Michael Yeadon.
[03:47:16.896 --> 03:47:18.898]  We could listen to him for 10 hours.
[03:47:18.898 --> 03:47:23.523]  And I want to really ask him the next month, whenever he can, to come back and do a commercial free broadcast.
[03:47:23.523 --> 03:47:25.666]  Because those podcasts get millions and millions of views.
[03:47:25.666 --> 03:47:27.287]  We've got to get him on Joe Rogan as well.
[03:47:27.287 --> 03:47:28.569]  His studio is right down the street.
[03:47:29.392 --> 03:47:35.397]  We've got Dr. Peter McCullough coming in here in studio next segment to talk about the vindication and everything that's come out of it.
[03:47:35.397 --> 03:47:36.538]  It's not about a victory lap.
[03:47:36.538 --> 03:47:40.000]  It's about these experts weren't lying to you and they went through hell.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:41.221]  He's been sued.
[03:47:41.221 --> 03:47:42.402]  He's been attacked.
[03:47:42.402 --> 03:47:44.384]  Everybody's been attacked.
[03:47:44.384 --> 03:47:47.366]  Dr. Peter McCullough, I've been viciously attacked, but it's okay.
[03:47:47.366 --> 03:47:49.508]  We can stare on air.
[03:47:49.508 --> 03:47:53.631]  If you just support us and if you just go to infowarestore.com and get the great products we have.
[03:47:53.631 --> 03:47:55.872]  This has been sold out for over two and a half years.
[03:47:55.872 --> 03:47:56.753]  We have the new formula.
[03:47:56.753 --> 03:47:57.674]  It's even stronger.
[03:47:57.674 --> 03:47:58.835]  It's got the
[03:47:59.657 --> 03:48:00.937]  Concentrated turmeric.
[03:48:00.937 --> 03:48:03.338]  It's got the concentrated chicken broth.
[03:48:03.338 --> 03:48:07.400]  It's got the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen, everything that's so good for your immune system.
[03:48:07.400 --> 03:48:08.200]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:48:08.200 --> 03:48:09.300]  The best out there.
[03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:11.801]  You're not going to find anything better.
[03:48:11.801 --> 03:48:12.281]  Back in stock.
[03:48:12.281 --> 03:48:12.561]  25% off.
[03:48:12.561 --> 03:48:14.142]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:48:14.142 --> 03:48:16.542]  And I just went off what the scientists and experts said that's good for your blood.
[03:48:16.542 --> 03:48:24.105]  Nitric Boost is our already number one best-selling product that we're able to private label that has compounds that really make your blood a lot healthier and cleaner and better.
[03:48:24.105 --> 03:48:27.206]  This is what a lot of doctors on the show have been recommending just with all the stuff going on.
[03:48:27.922 --> 03:48:36.946]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com and we have full-spectrum CBD, no THC, full-spectrum high-end CBD for about half the price you get it in stores.
[03:48:36.946 --> 03:48:43.329]  Private label by us, already top-selling brand in the country at InfoWarsTore.com and that's how we fight through this.
[03:48:43.329 --> 03:48:45.110]  By the grace of God, stay on air.
[03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:50.512]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com so we can continue to have these incredible guests on and fight through this together.
[03:48:50.512 --> 03:48:51.813]  But this is a war.
[03:48:51.813 --> 03:48:56.955]  So Dr. Yeadon, please continue in the 10 minutes we have left with other key points you want to add.
[03:48:58.009 --> 03:49:01.394]  I think the vedication is important because it shows you were right and others were right.
[03:49:01.394 --> 03:49:04.258]  So we can now prosecute and go after the folks that did this.
[03:49:04.258 --> 03:49:09.927]  Nuremberg 2, criminal investigations in Japan, Europe, Florida.
[03:49:09.927 --> 03:49:11.890]  I mean all over the place these things are starting.
[03:49:11.890 --> 03:49:12.431]  Please continue.
[03:49:13.453 --> 03:49:14.274]  Yeah, certainly.
[03:49:14.274 --> 03:49:21.961]  So, like I said, they lied to us from the beginning and the right number of times that your public health officials will lie zero.
[03:49:21.961 --> 03:49:26.946]  Soon as you realise they are lying, why would you believe anything else that they say?
[03:49:26.946 --> 03:49:32.692]  So, and then the main theme about the so-called vaccines is
[03:49:33.312 --> 03:49:37.795]  That even if the narrative was accurate, which it's not, they would not work.
[03:49:37.795 --> 03:49:41.037]  They're not life-saving, just as flu vaccines are not life-saving.
[03:49:41.037 --> 03:49:51.084]  And in particular, these messenger RNA creations, when they're expressed in various tissues of your body, cause your body to attack that tissue.
[03:49:51.084 --> 03:49:52.745]  And it will happen automatically.
[03:49:52.745 --> 03:49:55.627]  It's not an accidental side effect.
[03:49:55.627 --> 03:49:57.228]  It's built into the mechanism.
[03:49:57.228 --> 03:50:01.951]  So I describe these as toxic by design.
[03:50:01.951 --> 03:50:02.992]  And that's why I know it's
[03:50:03.012 --> 03:50:04.593]  It's deliberate and malign.
[03:50:04.593 --> 03:50:07.074]  I would say it's immunology 101.
[03:50:07.074 --> 03:50:11.316]  You would be taught it in the first couple of weeks of any basic immunology course.
[03:50:11.316 --> 03:50:16.519]  That's how you distinguish self from non-self and keep yourself safe and healthy.
[03:50:16.519 --> 03:50:22.382]  So don't, do not allow yourself, no matter the price and the punishment and the threats,
[03:50:22.882 --> 03:50:25.485]  to be injected by these mRNA products.
[03:50:25.485 --> 03:50:31.372]  If you've been unfortunate enough to have had one, today's a good day to resolve not to have any more.
[03:50:31.372 --> 03:50:37.959]  There are several groups working on potential antidotes and recoveries, but don't take the chance.
[03:50:37.959 --> 03:50:39.201]  They're not there for your health.
[03:50:39.201 --> 03:50:42.124]  They're there ultimately to, I think, to depopulate.
[03:50:42.784 --> 03:50:43.665]  So what are they going to do?
[03:50:43.665 --> 03:51:10.121]  Just to say it again, I predict that we will see ever more encroachment over our freedom of movement, our freedom to buy things, our freedom to consume fresh natural products, for example, and things will become more and more factory farms, including the ghastly news I heard tomorrow, the EU will approve a law that allows them to add a ground-up cricket
[03:51:10.641 --> 03:51:27.437]  So almost every baked goods and people don't know about the stuff they're going to be eating these but the other thing I predict I predicted as I said earlier is the introduction of a mandatory digital ID they'll say oh well you really need to have one in order that we know that it's you that's operating your bank account.
[03:51:27.877 --> 03:51:30.980]  Alex, I point out, banks have been around for centuries.
[03:51:30.980 --> 03:51:34.782]  We've never needed a digital ID, and we do not need one now.
[03:51:34.782 --> 03:51:35.843]  So, reject it.
[03:51:35.843 --> 03:51:38.906]  Push back any bank... By the way, just to interrupt, back to the crickets.
[03:51:38.906 --> 03:51:45.170]  I've seen a bunch of studies that the chitin shell of bugs, humans aren't meant to eat those.
[03:51:45.170 --> 03:51:52.436]  We can eat grubs and things that don't have that, the larval form, but it's very toxic to mammals, particularly humans, to eat bugs.
[03:51:53.638 --> 03:51:59.642]  Yeah, we do not have the enzymes in our guts to break down the shell chitin, as you said.
[03:51:59.642 --> 03:52:01.624]  We cannot eat it.
[03:52:01.624 --> 03:52:06.687]  So, you know, they might say, well, we'll take the wing cases off and we'll just use the squashy parts.
[03:52:06.687 --> 03:52:08.568]  It's a revolting idea.
[03:52:08.568 --> 03:52:13.812]  And the whole basis of it, that meat is environmentally bad, is just BS.
[03:52:13.812 --> 03:52:16.133]  So, you know, don't let them do it to us.
[03:52:16.133 --> 03:52:22.658]  And don't let them... I've explained why digital IV is the heart of tyranny.
[03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:24.340]  You do not need it.
[03:52:24.340 --> 03:52:25.461]  You've never needed it.
[03:52:25.461 --> 03:52:26.942]  You don't need it now.
[03:52:26.942 --> 03:52:31.663]  Someone's trying to make you have one and they're giving you bullshit reasons why you must have one.
[03:52:31.663 --> 03:52:39.367]  I think if they say without digital ID you can't travel overseas, I would say I'm going to campaign against it and I ain't traveling overseas until I win.
[03:52:39.367 --> 03:52:39.647]  That's right.
[03:52:39.647 --> 03:52:40.587]  We've got to draw a line in the sand.
[03:52:40.587 --> 03:52:41.928]  But you've said some really eloquent words.
[03:52:41.928 --> 03:52:47.610]  Can you repeat them or expand on them about Nuremberg 2, prosecutions, what needs to be done, Fauci gain of function?
[03:52:48.624 --> 03:52:50.706]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[03:52:50.706 --> 03:52:58.714]  I've just listed out several of the things that public health officials and senior people in pharmaceutical companies add a minimum, and there are many others.
[03:52:58.714 --> 03:53:07.122]  They've lied to us, they've destroyed or damaged with the intention to destroy the economy of the developed world, and I think that's deliberate.
[03:53:07.122 --> 03:53:07.863]  I think they want to
[03:53:08.443 --> 03:53:21.006]  Tell us, oh dear, the economy's broken, everyone's lost confidence in your currency, but the Bank of International Settlements and we, like the Fed, Federal Reserve, working together will bring out cashless central bank digital currency.
[03:53:21.006 --> 03:53:26.847]  Combination digital ID, mandatory, and cashless CBDC is the end of your freedom.
[03:53:26.847 --> 03:53:29.148]  We must not let this happen.
[03:53:29.148 --> 03:53:30.448]  So use cash
[03:53:31.346 --> 03:53:31.987]  I don't care.
[03:53:31.987 --> 03:53:37.156]  You know, it cannot be too inconvenient to save your life by going to an ATM if you haven't got an ATM.
[03:53:37.156 --> 03:53:40.662]  Oh, this makes me want to move to the country next to Amish and start bartering with them.
[03:53:40.662 --> 03:53:42.826]  I mean, the whole future is going to be getting away from this.
[03:53:44.320 --> 03:53:51.063]  Exactly, so I've written, you know, so use the cash, do some basic preparation, you know, whatever.
[03:53:51.063 --> 03:54:03.627]  I'm not a prepper, but I make sure that I know what my next move is, so I'm gonna, I will minimize the degree to which they can... But what about when you talk about going on the offense, though, peacefully, to prosecute him and nip it in the bud?
[03:54:03.627 --> 03:54:05.928]  Yeah, yeah, obviously, it's not my, not my...
[03:54:06.747 --> 03:54:15.194]  Field of expertise, but I have, I have written affidavits for at least 10 different court cases.
[03:54:15.194 --> 03:54:30.247]  So yes, I think wherever in the world and on whatever basis related to all these these COVID lies and the poisonous injections and the terrible hospital treatment on any of those bases, we need to attack, you know, using using law as well as
[03:54:31.701 --> 03:54:36.563]  Letting people know that this is happening and just trying to persuade them.
[03:54:36.563 --> 03:54:43.866]  As soon as people turn off mass media and start to think, they realize what I've said to you is absolutely true.
[03:54:43.866 --> 03:54:47.667]  So I say never give up, because these people are not going to... No, I agree.
[03:54:47.667 --> 03:54:57.811]  And how powerful it is that even if Musk doesn't let you and I back on, the people that really have an effect, that at least a lot of the stuff's coming out proving Big Pharma with Big Tech colluded to suppress people.
[03:54:57.811 --> 03:54:59.612]  I mean, that is a scandal of scandals.
[03:55:00.673 --> 03:55:01.294]  Absolutely.
[03:55:01.294 --> 03:55:10.820]  I'm not a bragging person, but I think the reason they have not allowed me back on, Alex, is that I am absolutely kryptonite for their narrative.
[03:55:10.820 --> 03:55:13.161]  People will believe me because I'm telling the truth.
[03:55:13.161 --> 03:55:14.862]  I've lost money.
[03:55:14.862 --> 03:55:15.943]  People say I'm a grifter.
[03:55:15.943 --> 03:55:17.824]  I've lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[03:55:17.824 --> 03:55:23.307]  I've made not one dollar in earnings, and I've not accepted one dollar in gifts.
[03:55:23.307 --> 03:55:24.748]  Which I think is your mistake.
[03:55:24.748 --> 03:55:27.010]  When you're championing freedom, you should be writing books.
[03:55:27.010 --> 03:55:27.490]  You should be...
[03:55:29.720 --> 03:55:38.850]  The point I wanted to make there is, I'm not making money from this, even though I could, and I think that improves the confidence the audience should have that I'm doing it honestly.
[03:55:38.850 --> 03:55:44.256]  But what proves it is you fouled stuff with the EU in 2000 saying everything was going to happen in the dead.
[03:55:44.256 --> 03:55:45.858]  You're totally vindicated in spades.
[03:55:47.528 --> 03:55:48.249]  Absolutely.
[03:55:48.249 --> 03:55:54.433]  Unfortunately, what is going on at high level is incredibly simple.
[03:55:54.433 --> 03:56:01.699]  I remember I read the canon of American sci-fi as a teenager, and this plot is really dull.
[03:56:01.699 --> 03:56:04.281]  It's horrible and frightening, but it's really straightforward.
[03:56:05.021 --> 03:56:09.207]  Digital ID, roll up for your vaccine, else we will not let you.
[03:56:09.207 --> 03:56:16.038]  Mad medical scientists kill most of us, the rest of us are sick for life, make us so sick we gotta be in artificial wombs, take over the human species.
[03:56:16.038 --> 03:56:20.164]  I mean, it's a THX 1138 meets Brave New World meets The Matrix.
[03:56:21.155 --> 03:56:22.396]  It is, it's all of that.
[03:56:22.396 --> 03:56:25.378]  So what else I would say, engage local leaders.
[03:56:25.378 --> 03:56:31.083]  If you've got a sheriff or a city mayor in a small town or whatever, go and find these people.
[03:56:31.083 --> 03:56:44.733]  Just take a half an hour meeting, respectfully, turn up with just two or three pieces of information that says we're clearly being lied to, it's not as described, and this guy in Yeaton and Malone and McCulloch and so on are really worrying me.
[03:56:44.934 --> 03:56:47.682]  And the good news is we're starting to win, but we can't give up now.
[03:56:47.682 --> 03:56:49.006]  We gotta push, push, push.
[03:56:49.006 --> 03:56:51.653]  Like you said, they've got new pandemics ready they're drilling for.
[03:56:52.754 --> 03:56:57.679]  Yeah, no, pandemics are, I think, I should tell you, pandemics are actually impossible.
[03:56:57.679 --> 03:57:02.484]  And I'll just explain what respiratory, severe respiratory disease pandemics are impossible.
[03:57:02.484 --> 03:57:03.705]  Let me say why.
[03:57:03.705 --> 03:57:12.654]  That just like Ebola, if you've got a really serious respiratory infection, you become symptomatic the day you were infected, and that means you withdraw from circulation.
[03:57:12.654 --> 03:57:14.916]  You're sick in your bed, in your living room or in bed.
[03:57:15.416 --> 03:57:17.938]  So that means you've stopped infecting other people.
[03:57:17.938 --> 03:57:24.202]  It's literally not possible to have a severe respiratory disease pandemic, and that's why we've never had one.
[03:57:24.202 --> 03:57:27.283]  The Spanish flu, they've lied to us about that.
[03:57:27.283 --> 03:57:31.226]  People died of bacterial pneumonia in a pre-antibiotic era.
[03:57:31.226 --> 03:57:33.487]  All right, Dr. Michael Yeadon, incredible.
[03:57:33.487 --> 03:57:36.209]  Please come back soon for a commercial-free podcast.
[03:57:36.209 --> 03:57:37.089]  I'd love to.

[03:57:37.650 --> 03:57:37.990]  Thank you.
[03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:40.452]  We're going to go to break and come back with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[03:57:40.452 --> 03:57:40.912]  Incredible.
[03:57:40.912 --> 03:57:41.892]  Thank you, Dr. Yeadon.
[03:57:41.892 --> 03:57:42.473]  God bless you.

[03:58:47.535 --> 03:59:00.161]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:59:00.161 --> 03:59:04.183]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:59:04.183 --> 03:59:06.484]  And it's the same scion today.
[03:59:06.484 --> 03:59:13.368]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, and because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[03:59:14.048 --> 03:59:22.878]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:59:22.878 --> 03:59:28.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
