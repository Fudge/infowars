[00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:16.366]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.547]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:17.908]  Today.
[00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:35.301]  Founded by David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission has been an arm of the globalist Deep State since 1973.
[00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:41.728]  Last week at their annual meeting, a speaker who cannot be identified according to Commission rules
[00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:48.614]  Said that we are now in a period of structural inflation that will last for decades.
[00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:53.638]  They said that the free market is over and industry now sets policy.
[00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:56.401]  And they said that this year, 2023, is year one of this new global order.
[00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:11.611]  Days later, the Federal Reserve Bank announces a July launch for their new FedNow service, which was first announced in October of 2021.
[00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:20.415]  The too-big-to-fail banks and all the large processors are already on board, and so is the U.S.
[00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:20.736]  Treasury.
[00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:35.560]  The first week of April, the Federal Reserve begins the FedNow pilot program for early adopters to become certified participants to help the Fed confirm readiness for their July launch.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:47.349]  FedNow is an instant payment processing system that seeks to be the base of all digital transactions, acting as an umbrella company to manage all financial payments.
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:54.252]  This has been shown to be the gateway to a central bank digital currency, CBDC.
[00:01:54.252 --> 00:02:03.697]  FedNow is much like the Reserve Bank of India's instant payment system, the Unified Payments Interface, or UPI.
[00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:10.541]  UPI has had huge success in converting rural communities into a complete cashless society.
[00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:21.304]  According to the International Monetary Fund, UPI democratized the payment system and paved the way for central bank digital currencies.
[00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:33.608]  Central bank instant payment processing is also how the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced its CBDC, INIRA, which has been, so far, violently rejected.
[00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:35.909]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:55.353]  Welcome to America, communist Chinese style.
[00:02:55.353 --> 00:02:56.894]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:57.054]  Inc.
[00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:59.055]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:00.856]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.737]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:03:04.503 --> 00:03:08.826]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.326]  Target selection complete.
[00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:12.208]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:19.372]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:25.255]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:31.659]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.080]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:37.725]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:38.846]  You bet!
[00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:43.171]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.135]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:47.677]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:51.561]  Shall we play a game?
[00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:52.603]  Call it down.
[00:03:59.562 --> 00:04:04.428]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:06.710]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.132]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:04:08.132 --> 00:04:09.493]  We are on a launch mode.
[00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:13.819]  Without provocation.
[00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.701]  We're in!
[00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:21.481]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:24.002]  We have a Soviet submarine watch detection.
[00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:26.063]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:28.024]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:30.165]  Friends pretend.
[00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:31.285]  The only winning who is.
[00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:40.948]  It's Monday.
[00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:46.271]  That's Monday, March 20th, 2023.
[00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:48.532]  Big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:51.793]  Robert Barnes on in the second hour.
[00:04:51.793 --> 00:04:54.455]  We're going to open the phones up.
[00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:57.316]  We are on Trump indictment arrest watch.
[00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:01.318]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:04.739]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:10.829]  I want you all to know something.
[00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:12.791]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.313]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:19.436]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:23.679]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:25.901]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.423]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:32.866]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:36.027]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:37.067]  Years ago.
[00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:39.128]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:41.129]  Not for a second.
[00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.650]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.110]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.231]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:53.873]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:16.869]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:21.474]  Here we are, Monday, March 20th, 2023.
[00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:30.810]  We're host Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.752]  We'll be here for the next four hours and then the great Owen Troyer takes over 3 p.m.
[00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:37.495]  Central, NymphoWars.com and stations across the country.
[00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:47.744]  All right, obviously we're on Trump indictment arrest watch with the kangaroo puppet George Soros' DA.
[00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:53.769]  They're carrying out the operations in New York City.
[00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:55.690]  We have all of the accoutrements.
[00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.443]  That goes with that.
[00:06:58.443 --> 00:07:06.072]  We have Xi Jinping arriving in Moscow to meet with Putin.
[00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:10.337]  And the arrest warrant obviously issued for Putin last Friday.
[00:07:10.337 --> 00:07:12.519]  Notice all this is happening at the same moment.
[00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:15.583]  UN arrest warrants for Putin.
[00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:17.405]  Arrest being prepared for Trump.
[00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:22.442]  Basically, it's anybody that opposes the globalists that run this country.
[00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:29.985]  I'm certainly not saying Xi Jinping's a good guy or Putin's perfect, just because they're not part of this New World Order.
[00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:32.646]  Xi Jinping has his New World Order.
[00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:41.630]  Russia just wants to be left alone, but the United States is occupied and hijacked by some very, very serious criminals.
[00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.632]  So we're going to be laying it all out here today.
[00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:46.992]  Also,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.721]  We're going to be looking at what's happening with the economy.
[00:07:52.721 --> 00:08:04.183]  We have different international bank monitoring groups and rating services like Moody's and others saying that over 200 banks are on the verge of insolvency.
[00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:05.123]  It's real bad.
[00:08:05.123 --> 00:08:14.785]  Western countries, central banks over the weekend organized to provide daily liquidity of dollars in the event of a worldwide bank collapse.
[00:08:16.937 --> 00:08:24.643]  We'll also be looking at more studies coming out that lockdowns massively increase illness and death.
[00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:31.668]  Not just from the virus, but from suicide more and how they knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:08:31.668 --> 00:08:44.298]  Also have a big stack of articles of so-called intellectuals, thought leaders, philosophers of the left praising censorship and saying those we don't agree with don't deserve to be heard.
[00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:51.512]  You should not have opinions on Ukraine, vaccines, or climate change.
[00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:54.794]  That's leftist thinker, they call him.
[00:08:54.794 --> 00:08:58.117]  Sam Harris, the condescension, the arrogance.
[00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:02.180]  These self-appointed control freaks is flabbergasting.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:09.745]  And that ties in with Yahoo News promoting, it's reasonable, we should rewrite Shakespeare, Orwell, and everything else.
[00:09:09.745 --> 00:09:14.009]  It's not censorship.
[00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:15.610]  It's evolution.
[00:09:17.113 --> 00:09:19.934]  Yes, it's not rewriting literary history.
[00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.115]  It's not super scary.
[00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:24.296]  It's not a 10 on the Richter scale of tyranny.
[00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:24.956]  No!
[00:09:24.956 --> 00:09:37.422]  I mean, Ed Harris is a philosopher who comes off like someone with an A.D.I.Q., but we've got Sam Harris.
[00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:40.303]  We've got to bow down to him.
[00:09:40.303 --> 00:09:42.444]  We've got to worship him.
[00:09:42.444 --> 00:09:45.305]  We're going to be going over all of that as well.
[00:09:47.788 --> 00:10:06.052]  Also, I've seen three reports the last couple days of young people dying in Mexico unexplainedly, and then later it's linked to fentanyl, and our media says, don't go to Mexico, it's so dangerous.
[00:10:06.052 --> 00:10:15.194]  Well, in the last week, three people I know, two of them very well, or three groups I know, because in one group I'm good friends with them,
[00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:18.715]  Husband and the wife have known him for 27 years.
[00:10:18.715 --> 00:10:20.536]  I'm not going to say their names.
[00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:23.577]  They asked me not to this morning.
[00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:40.144]  But three groups of people in the last week who lost family members to fentanyl and at least in one case their niece was a medical student who didn't do drugs and went to a party and fell down dead and they tested her blood.
[00:10:40.144 --> 00:10:41.165]  It was fentanyl.
[00:10:41.165 --> 00:10:43.826]  Somebody obviously slipped it in her drink.
[00:10:44.943 --> 00:10:47.685]  Thinking it would make her, I guess, more pliable.
[00:10:47.685 --> 00:10:49.826]  And she's dead.
[00:10:49.826 --> 00:10:51.887]  And I actually knew her.
[00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:54.469]  Met her a couple times.
[00:10:54.469 --> 00:10:56.050]  When she was a little girl.
[00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.932]  She was 24 years old.
[00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:04.314]  And is dead.
[00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:10.078]  And so my point is, oh, three people died in Mexico in the last couple days of fentanyl.
[00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:11.659]  Okay.
[00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:13.400]  Well, I know three people
[00:11:14.397 --> 00:11:24.608]  Who died just in my circle of friends who had family die from fentanyl in the last week.
[00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:26.611]  I mean, it is scary.
[00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:31.256]  They say it's killing 100,000 people a year, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.218]  It's killing way more than that.
[00:11:33.218 --> 00:11:34.840]  I know so many people.
[00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:43.364]  Who have lost family members, including sons and daughters to this.
[00:11:43.364 --> 00:11:52.249]  And now there's cases of 50, 60 year olds in places like Dominican Republic, which has been a nice place to go previously.
[00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:55.911]  I've never been there, but I hear it's nice and expensive.
[00:11:55.911 --> 00:12:04.015]  But they get in the mini bar and somebody sticks fentanyl in the whiskey and they die.
[00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:09.375]  So this isn't something like you're a drug addict or you're a druggie.
[00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:13.918]  You go to a party, you take a hit off somebody's vape, they tell you it's THC or marijuana, you're dead.
[00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:16.680]  Or a baby's crawling around.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:23.505]  You hear about this all the time on the ground, at the park, or outside, and gets some fentanyl on their finger and sticks it in their mouth and dies, or almost dies.
[00:12:23.505 --> 00:12:25.807]  I mean, we see them every day.
[00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:31.631]  It's just, to me, what are we going to do about this?
[00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.751]  I mean, it is just so...
[00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:37.421]  Crazy, and I have four children.
[00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:50.950]  And I'm very blessed that the adult children don't even drink or smoke marijuana.
[00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.851]  And then the 15-year-old doesn't.
[00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:55.088]  Not into that, that's good.
[00:12:55.088 --> 00:13:02.051]  And then of course my five and a half year old has not ever had a chance to experience that, and that's good.
[00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:22.297]  But it just enrages me that you could have a child, or they can be 15, they can be 30, they can be 25, and they go to a party, and now it's happened to older folks, and somebody hands you a marijuana cigarette, and you take a puff off of it, and you're dead five minutes later.
[00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:29.495]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:33.458]  Absolutely crazy.
[00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:44.667]  I have another friend who's in his early seventies, and he was just having a four or five months ago, his pacemaker updated.
[00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:50.044]  It said to go in and pick something and it's a minor surgery.
[00:13:50.044 --> 00:13:51.405]  It's seen as a minor heart surgery.
[00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:55.548]  No heart surgery is minor in my view, but it's seen as one of the safest procedures.
[00:13:55.548 --> 00:14:00.072]  And it almost killed him.
[00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:04.155]  And he went into a coma for a couple days.
[00:14:04.155 --> 00:14:13.943]  Because they decided to use the anesthesiologist, Sentinel, as the anesthesia.
[00:14:13.943 --> 00:14:14.504]  And it almost
[00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:19.195]  Killed him.
[00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:21.695]  So this fentanyl, and you can look it up, the U.S.
[00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:26.316]  government created it, of course.
[00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:29.977]  Back in the 70s.
[00:14:29.977 --> 00:14:38.920]  And now the Communist Chinese and MS-13 and the rest of the criminal groups have figured out how to make it.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.001]  And this is just the beginning of all these super synthetic drugs and stuff.
[00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:43.801]  I gotta tell you this.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.861]  I don't trust this criminal government to carry out the death penalty.
[00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:51.042]  I know they love to target innocent people.
[00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:57.484]  But at the same time, I really think they should expedite the execution of people selling fentanyl.
[00:14:57.484 --> 00:15:07.128]  You know, they don't have any fentanyl deaths in Communist China, because if they catch you with opiates, they execute your ass.
[00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:13.230]  And there's very few executions a year in China of drug dealers, because people know, you do it, you're dead.
[00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:26.503]  But this has gotten so out of control, now we have hundreds of thousands of people dying a year, and I want to ask the question, the numbers are going straight up by the way, it's getting worse every few months.
[00:15:26.503 --> 00:15:32.549]  What about all the people that are innocent, who didn't even know they were taking fentanyl?
[00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:34.311]  I want to warn young people out there.
[00:15:35.117 --> 00:15:44.803]  I'm never a big drug guy, but in high school and college I tried this, I tried that, I never stuck a needle in my arm, but I tried cocaine a couple times, tried methamphetamine, you know, tried things that always did not like it.
[00:15:44.803 --> 00:15:46.604]  That's why I never did it again.
[00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:50.267]  But you can't experiment with anything.
[00:15:50.267 --> 00:15:52.668]  Not pills, not somebody tells you it's ecstasy, anything.
[00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:56.070]  Young people, don't do anything.
[00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.972]  You cannot take anything.
[00:15:57.972 --> 00:15:58.452]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:03.413]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[00:16:03.413 --> 00:16:14.287]  The globalists are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others.

[00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:53.030]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.911]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:55.671]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:18:55.671 --> 00:19:00.173]  You can get them right now.
[00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:04.315]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:19:04.315 --> 00:19:08.057]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:19:08.057 --> 00:19:10.438]  Jerzy Bolton from CBS News.
[00:19:10.438 --> 00:19:12.059]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:16.154]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:20.619]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:24.023]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:19:24.023 --> 00:19:28.068]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:30.410]  It was almost as if it were a plan in full.
[00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.111]  It just can't get through.
[00:19:32.072 --> 00:19:33.473]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:33.873]  Stop!
[00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:34.193]  Stop!
[00:19:34.193 --> 00:19:35.954]  Stop!
[00:19:35.954 --> 00:19:38.075]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:39.696]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:41.897]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:44.378]  You silenced those voices.
[00:19:44.378 --> 00:19:48.140]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:54.563]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:20:00.737 --> 00:20:05.318]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:19.623]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:19.623 --> 00:20:24.104]  The world is in deep crisis.
[00:20:24.104 --> 00:20:26.625]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:29.306]  If you're a TV viewer, we have the
[00:20:30.879 --> 00:20:43.069]  Set lit up as Washington DC, what it would look like after a hydrogen bomb detonated over it.
[00:20:43.069 --> 00:20:45.231]  And that's really the future that I'm trying to avoid.
[00:20:45.231 --> 00:20:47.633]  And I think most of us here don't want to be in.
[00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:52.356]  I'm going to replace this background with the American flag.
[00:20:52.356 --> 00:20:59.822]  And the better things this country stands for than fentanyl and drag queen pedophile time and the new world order.
[00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:02.486]  So next segment, we'll go with the American flag.
[00:21:02.486 --> 00:21:11.092]  I know I said go with this background because it is the destruction of our republic we're witnessing, but I'm going to put up a more hopeful image because things are so dark.
[00:21:11.092 --> 00:21:12.633]  Why?
[00:21:12.633 --> 00:21:14.955]  Why have things clash?
[00:21:14.955 --> 00:21:21.759]  So let's get into the Trump situation, and then I'm going to open the phones up in the next two segments.
[00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:24.761]  I'm only going to take six, seven calls.
[00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:29.905]  I want to hear from you ahead of Robert Barnes joining us on the impending Trump indictment.
[00:21:31.345 --> 00:21:45.499]  Now they're saying that the George Soros DA may get cold feet because even the feds didn't charge Trump with this and there's a statute of limitations of five years and it's not a state felony but they've made it a felony and so how are they even doing that?
[00:21:45.499 --> 00:21:55.929]  No president's ever been charged and the reason no former or current president's ever been charged is then any district attorney could remove a president anytime they wanted basically.
[00:21:57.728 --> 00:21:59.409]  That's why presidents have veto power.
[00:21:59.409 --> 00:22:02.652]  It's why they have the power of the pardon.
[00:22:02.652 --> 00:22:05.695]  Because you've got to have a separation of powers in the government.
[00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:06.916]  Doesn't mean a president's above the law.
[00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:08.337]  They can be impeached.
[00:22:08.337 --> 00:22:16.164]  But there's never been a charge where anyone was willing to go that far to do it because it's so dangerous.
[00:22:16.164 --> 00:22:23.911]  And I'll hand it to DeSantis that he came out to Trump's defense and said this is wrong and a constitutional crisis.
[00:22:24.955 --> 00:22:30.479]  Even though Trump is his main political adversary.
[00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:32.200]  But DeSantis also understands the numbers.
[00:22:33.413 --> 00:22:41.257]  Trump, just since this started, has gone from a dead heat in polls with DeSantis to at least 15 points on average ahead of him.
[00:22:41.257 --> 00:22:54.364]  It'll be political suicide for DeSantis not to do this because this is a question that's been fought for 240 years in the courts and it's been a common sense decision that you do not indict current or former presidents.
[00:22:54.364 --> 00:23:00.427]  It opens too big a can of worms and allows voters to have their will of who they're going to vote for blocked.
[00:23:00.427 --> 00:23:01.808]  And with Trump being the frontrunner,
[00:23:02.901 --> 00:23:15.792]  In the presidential field, in the Republican nomination department, and in any real numbers you look at beating Democrats easily as well except for election fraud, this will only supercharge him.
[00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:20.135]  So, why do they do it?
[00:23:20.135 --> 00:23:24.539]  Because they can't help it and they're hysterical and they want total power.
[00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:30.784]  Why do you think Soros would get in over a thousand district attorneys in the country, get them into office with billions of dollars of money,
[00:23:32.554 --> 00:23:35.996]  And then have them release mass shooters.
[00:23:35.996 --> 00:23:51.246]  Right here where I live in Texas last year, two different mass shooters, one in Fort Worth and one in Austin, after they shot multiple people, were released within days from jail by Soros DAs because they were black.
[00:23:51.246 --> 00:23:53.027]  That's just cases where I live.
[00:23:53.027 --> 00:23:56.730]  It is crazy town, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:57.773 --> 00:24:04.116]  But at the same time, they let shooters and criminals and murderers and rapists out of jail.
[00:24:04.116 --> 00:24:14.701]  They want to prosecute Trump for a seven-year-old supposed crime that's not even been proven, but is alleged, of paying off a high-end hooker.
[00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:17.202]  Not like she's 17 years old or 16.
[00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:20.464]  Boy, I'd be against Trump in two seconds right there.
[00:24:20.464 --> 00:24:24.706]  A 30-something-year-old woman who supposedly even went on.
[00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:26.947]  So, it's just crazy, and Trump never claimed
[00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:33.747]  To be Lily Pure, Trump basically is well known as a womanizer.
[00:24:33.747 --> 00:24:36.910]  So who'd you think you were electing?
[00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.833]  At least he wasn't a hypocrite about it.
[00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:46.219]  So, New York City braces for unrest after Trump calls for protest over possible arrest indictment.
[00:24:47.557 --> 00:24:57.265]  We've got all the clips, we'll play one here in a moment of Maxine Waters saying he's mobilizing his terrorists, he's mobilizing his terrorists for violence, but she's the one that actually calls for violence.
[00:24:57.265 --> 00:25:03.050]  And listen, I don't think people should be intimidated because of January 6th to protest, but call for peaceful protest.
[00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:08.696]  Trump is in his right to say our country is collapsing, it's in deep trouble.
[00:25:08.696 --> 00:25:11.219]  They're destroying the nation at every level.
[00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:14.662]  They're destroying our currency, annihilating our borders, starting World War III.
[00:25:14.662 --> 00:25:17.866]  You know what he said, but then he says, take back our country, protest!
[00:25:19.141 --> 00:25:22.703]  Now that's not a call for violence, but it can be interpreted as that.
[00:25:22.703 --> 00:25:29.427]  So when they have provocateurs trying to stir people up, they can then demonize everybody else, including Trump.
[00:25:29.427 --> 00:25:34.530]  So the press release he put out Friday, you can tell he wrote it, had spelling errors in it, all the rest of it.
[00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:44.276]  It's kind of endearing, but not the smartest thing to do to give them any type of cover for what they did on January 6th, now that that's all coming out.
[00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:46.938]  I would have added the word peaceful protest.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:58.182]  But you can't then not see Conservatives or Populists or Christians or Nationalists protest, not just this, but all sorts of events, because of January 6th.
[00:25:58.182 --> 00:26:09.285]  We've seen a marked, massive decrease in protesting and demonstrations since January 6th by what you call the Tea Party Populist-Nationalist because of that.
[00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:15.446]  And we can't let ourselves be intimidated just because we got tricked into a few thousand people
[00:26:16.414 --> 00:26:25.739]  Not even that, maybe a couple hundred being violent, participating in the federal event, the provocateur event of January 6th.
[00:26:25.739 --> 00:26:26.960]  Let's continue with these headlines.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.063]  New York City braces for unrest after Trump calls for protests over possible arrest indictment.
[00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:35.089]  The Hill reports, don't worry, we'll get Trump.
[00:26:35.089 --> 00:26:37.869]  There's all sorts of new indictments, both federal and state, coming.
[00:26:37.869 --> 00:26:38.730]  This is just the beginning.
[00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.050]  That's their plan.
[00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.931]  Georgia, D.C., you name it.
[00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:42.791]  Breaking.
[00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:43.771]  Is this all a scam?
[00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:49.333]  Now it looks like President Trump will not be arrested Tuesday.
[00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:58.036]  Now, talking to mainstream news, sources in the DA's office are saying, well, they have more witnesses to call Monday, and so they're not sure now.
[00:26:58.036 --> 00:27:00.757]  Well, it would be a smart move for everybody for them not to do that.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.482]  Unless they just want to supercharge Trump even more.
[00:27:03.482 --> 00:27:06.624]  So now they suddenly want to hear Trump's witnesses.
[00:27:20.623 --> 00:27:27.645]  Because I think the same people in the federal government that killed the federal indictment of Trump understand that this isn't even good for the deep state, folks.
[00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:29.646]  And it's certainly not good for the general public.
[00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:34.308]  We need to stop the escalation of destabilization.
[00:27:34.308 --> 00:27:35.288]  It needs to stop.
[00:27:35.288 --> 00:27:38.469]  No president's been indicted in 240-something years for a reason.
[00:27:38.469 --> 00:27:40.870]  We need to follow the precedent.
[00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.491]  It needs to not happen.
[00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:46.492]  But if you want to see the world go crazy,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:55.466]  Like some of the Soros steep-stainers do, the same ones start World War III by all means.
[00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:59.869]  Let's continue down this insane path.
[00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:00.689]  I'm going to come back.
[00:28:00.689 --> 00:28:08.395]  Nancy Pelosi condemns Trump's reckless push for arrest protests, and Maxine Waters and the rest of it.
[00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:11.457]  How dare them imply protests are somehow bad?
[00:28:12.861 --> 00:28:15.523]  Because they claim this is a legitimate indictment.
[00:28:15.523 --> 00:28:24.568]  Well, whether it's legitimate or illegitimate, it's obviously illegitimate to the statute of limitations front, then it's your right to protest.
[00:28:24.568 --> 00:28:27.389]  Even if you're wrong, you're allowed to protest.
[00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:34.713]  So the idea that, well, you're not the right, so you don't get to protest, that's what Sam Harris actually says in a new video coming up.
[00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:40.997]  We'll talk about it all with Robert Barnes in about 30 minutes, but I want to give the number out and take your calls on the Trump indictment arrest watch.
[00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:46.673]  Numbers 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[00:28:46.673 --> 00:28:54.199]  Alright folks, it's Monday, March 20th, 2023.
[00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:56.121]  Big Broadcast rolls forward.
[00:28:56.121 --> 00:29:00.464]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.464 --> 00:29:05.809]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[00:29:07.383 --> 00:29:11.407]  Dr. Jones Natural's Turmeric Toothpaste that just came into stock.
[00:29:11.407 --> 00:29:14.690]  And I gotta tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.634]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth, is insane.
[00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:21.918]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory.
[00:29:21.918 --> 00:29:23.059]  It does such great things for the body.
[00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:26.842]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[00:29:26.842 --> 00:29:28.043]  It is just dynamite.
[00:29:28.043 --> 00:29:32.626]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[00:29:32.626 --> 00:29:36.890]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.612]  Dr. Jones Naturals Turmeric Toothpaste.

[00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.272]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[00:30:02.272 --> 00:30:05.455]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[00:30:05.455 --> 00:30:06.076]  You know why?
[00:30:06.076 --> 00:30:07.517]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[00:30:07.517 --> 00:30:10.280]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[00:30:11.138 --> 00:30:14.661]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:20.145]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:30:20.145 --> 00:30:23.127]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:30:23.127 --> 00:30:24.448]  This is reality.
[00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:26.130]  It's just pancakes.
[00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.752]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:30:28.752 --> 00:30:30.833]  A revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:33.635]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[00:30:33.635 --> 00:30:34.856]  You're lying to the public.
[00:30:34.856 --> 00:30:35.897]  It's disgusting.
[00:30:35.897 --> 00:30:37.999]  The media continues to misrepresent
[00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:39.200]  What I've said.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.224]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[00:30:42.224 --> 00:30:46.209]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[00:30:46.209 --> 00:30:48.172]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[00:30:48.172 --> 00:30:50.174]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[00:30:50.174 --> 00:30:52.518]  We're gonna get fired up about the real things!
[00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:53.559]  The things that matter!
[00:30:58.194 --> 00:30:59.215]  Burn in hell, New World Order!
[00:31:15.196 --> 00:31:15.456]  I think so.
[00:31:31.238 --> 00:31:38.360]  High quality ashwagandha root for your libido, your stamina, your testosterone with black pepper extract to accelerate it as a pill.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.241]  And we have ashwagandha root gummies as well.
[00:31:41.241 --> 00:31:42.941]  Very strong, very powerful.

[00:32:13.827 --> 00:32:14.467]  So on it.

[00:32:18.831 --> 00:32:19.951]  I'm praying for the broadcast.
[00:32:19.951 --> 00:32:20.932]  I'm buying product.
[00:32:20.932 --> 00:32:38.017]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence, that have never actually gone to Infowarshore.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life, but again, will keep this broadcast transmitted.
[00:32:38.017 --> 00:32:41.939]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus or our super high quality CBD oil for the 50% off
[00:32:42.719 --> 00:32:43.400]  We're good to go.
[00:33:23.746 --> 00:33:24.767]  Big Brother.
[00:33:24.767 --> 00:33:26.549]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:28.471]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:28.471 --> 00:33:30.153]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:30.153 --> 00:33:31.815]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:31.815 --> 00:33:36.360]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.946 --> 00:34:01.058]  So here is the maniac who, three years ago, in dozens of speeches on the House floor, on MSNBC, on CNN, in the streets, called for people to go out and be violent and confront Republicans and get in their faces and praise the mostly peaceful protesters burning down two and a half billion dollars of stuff, killing over a hundred people, including seven police officers.
[00:34:01.058 --> 00:34:04.780]  I mean, antifa members shot dozens of people in the back or in their cars.
[00:34:05.951 --> 00:34:06.832]  Over a hundred deaths.
[00:34:06.832 --> 00:34:09.953]  And it would just be a blip on the radar screen.
[00:34:09.953 --> 00:34:21.619]  Two weeks ago, they attacked the new police training center in Atlanta, burning down part of the building and cars and bulldozers and firing improvised explosive devices at the police.
[00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:23.020]  Not even a blip on the radar screen.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.582]  And now they're like, oh, he called for protest.
[00:34:25.582 --> 00:34:27.242]  It's the end of the world.
[00:34:27.242 --> 00:34:31.064]  Trump's gonna, oh, he's mobilizing his terrorists.
[00:34:31.064 --> 00:34:31.705]  Listen, lady.
[00:34:34.514 --> 00:34:39.279]  If there had been a real insurrection on January 6th, you'd have known it, sweetheart.
[00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:42.922]  And if a million Trump supporters showed up in D.C., there wouldn't be a thing you could do.
[00:34:42.922 --> 00:34:44.584]  But we're not like you.
[00:34:44.584 --> 00:34:46.746]  We don't want a dictatorship.
[00:34:46.746 --> 00:34:47.747]  Not yours, not ours.
[00:34:47.747 --> 00:34:49.809]  We want our republic back.
[00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:51.551]  You wicked woman.
[00:34:51.551 --> 00:34:52.032]  Here she is.
[00:34:53.988 --> 00:35:06.962]  Oh, I just wanted to, you know, have you to understand that perhaps he was trying to organize the domestic terrorists to protest his arrest.
[00:35:06.962 --> 00:35:07.242]  Right.
[00:35:07.242 --> 00:35:11.446]  Yeah, and I think we have to be careful about him making that announcement.
[00:35:11.446 --> 00:35:12.748]  He's doing it for a reason.
[00:35:13.793 --> 00:35:20.275]  Right, and we are being careful about reporting that aspect of his Truth Social post, but I want to be clear.
[00:35:20.275 --> 00:35:24.697]  The former president has not officially been indicted.
[00:35:24.697 --> 00:35:34.840]  We, and as a result, we do not know what, if any, charges he could be indicted on until we hear from the Manhattan D.A.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.800]  So, did you hear?
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.901]  The protesters are terrorists, so protesting is terror.
[00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:50.075]  Trey Gowdy, former federal prosecutor, says Manhattan's DA case against President Trump risked the demise of our country.
[00:35:50.075 --> 00:35:52.657]  Well, yeah, that's how republics end.
[00:35:52.657 --> 00:35:58.341]  Democrats accuse Trump of inciting violence as all part of his playbook.
[00:35:58.341 --> 00:36:04.225]  DA leading Trump case says rhetoric won't intimidate his office.
[00:36:04.225 --> 00:36:06.527]  Trump's call for protest gets muted.
[00:36:06.527 --> 00:36:07.728]  Reaction by supporters.
[00:36:07.728 --> 00:36:09.770]  Yeah, they think they're going to be set up.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.321]  Like January 6th.
[00:36:11.321 --> 00:36:14.405]  Well, it's going to be a lot harder now.
[00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:18.069]  We thought Antifa might bomb us or attack us on January 6th, 2021.
[00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:21.313]  We were looking for that.
[00:36:21.313 --> 00:36:28.301]  And instead, they put provocateurs in our midst and got a tiny fraction of people to actually go to the Capitol.
[00:36:29.315 --> 00:36:31.076]  That's all come out now.
[00:36:31.076 --> 00:36:37.518]  But people do need to protest, they need to demonstrate, not just this, but open borders, and fentanyl, and World War III.
[00:36:37.518 --> 00:36:44.161]  So don't let Maxine Waters say you're a terrorist if you protest, and don't listen to that intimidation.
[00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:52.224]  All right, let's open the phones up ahead of Robert Barnes joining us to cover this big subject with the Trump indictment, arrest watch, and more.
[00:36:52.224 --> 00:36:57.707]  But just on the statute of limitations, and the fact they've had to change this from a misdemeanor in New York,
[00:36:58.584 --> 00:36:58.844]  D.A.
[00:36:58.844 --> 00:37:01.305]  says he can do that, he really can't, to a felony.
[00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:04.246]  That alone makes it a stunt.
[00:37:04.246 --> 00:37:16.070]  Even if he gets a controlled jury, even if they convict him, there's no appeals court in the country that's going to uphold something when the statute of limitations is absolutely clear.
[00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.511]  So again, why are they doing it?
[00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:20.872]  Because all these other D.A.s are scared to do it.
[00:37:20.872 --> 00:37:22.953]  They've all got their cooked up cases in D.C.
[00:37:22.953 --> 00:37:24.974]  and Georgia and a bunch of other places.
[00:37:25.925 --> 00:37:37.131]  So they want somebody to jump off the cliff first and maybe the DA's starting to second guess himself a little bit here.
[00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:41.213]  Does he want to be the first idiot to jump?
[00:37:41.213 --> 00:37:43.495]  All right, let's talk to Brett in Maine.
[00:37:43.495 --> 00:37:46.096]  You're on the air, Brett.
[00:37:46.096 --> 00:37:46.956]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:37:46.956 --> 00:37:47.297]  Good, sir.
[00:37:47.297 --> 00:37:49.158]  Go ahead.
[00:37:49.158 --> 00:37:53.560]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring up, I mean, I myself have voted for Trump twice.
[00:37:54.313 --> 00:37:55.774]  I used to live in California.
[00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:57.895]  I'm from Maine, originally.
[00:37:57.895 --> 00:38:05.058]  And I've kind of seen the gamut of how it's been under Trump's presidency, especially wearing a Trump hat in California and things like that.
[00:38:05.058 --> 00:38:12.941]  But I also am kind of concerned with this DeSantis-Trump war that's kind of evolved in front of us.
[00:38:12.941 --> 00:38:21.905]  And I, from a very long time ago, have kind of had Roger Stone's position of Yale-y people's bad, especially people who are openly part of the St.
[00:38:21.905 --> 00:38:22.966]  Elmo Society, like
[00:38:23.393 --> 00:38:25.235]  Ron DeSantis is.
[00:38:25.235 --> 00:38:37.504]  But at the same time, we can't be leveling the same criticisms that we would against Trump five, six months ago against DeSantis now, and acting like it's something different.
[00:38:37.504 --> 00:38:44.810]  A lot of things Trump promised us that he would do, this whole Caesar versus Augustus kind of thing, he wasn't Caesar.
[00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:45.651]  He had his chance.
[00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:54.474]  I don't know if we can really trust Trump, even if he's our guy and he's so wonderful and this indictment, you know, it passes over him and nothing happens and he gets back in office.
[00:38:54.474 --> 00:38:57.816]  Can we really trust him with all the power to really do anything?
[00:38:57.816 --> 00:39:00.597]  And I think, like, I don't trust DeSantis at all.
[00:39:15.506 --> 00:39:24.653]  But at the same rate, I think he's trying to make a name for himself, and I trust him to do more things in office than I actually trust Trump to do.
[00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:25.634]  Alright, interesting points.
[00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:27.155]  Appreciate your call.
[00:39:27.155 --> 00:39:28.717]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Canada.
[00:39:28.717 --> 00:39:30.498]  You're on the air talking about the Trump indictment.
[00:39:30.498 --> 00:39:32.700]  Go ahead.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:38.665]  Hey Alex, this indictment is bad news for the United States, as you have mentioned.
[00:39:39.548 --> 00:39:43.190]  However, Trump's coming up on his 80th birthday.
[00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.310]  The guy's getting pretty old.
[00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:49.192]  I think it's time for DeSantis to really make a run at the presidency.
[00:39:49.192 --> 00:39:52.174]  I'd like to see Trump be his VP.
[00:39:52.174 --> 00:39:52.994]  What's your take on that?
[00:39:54.827 --> 00:39:56.648]  You know, I don't think the two are going to work together.
[00:39:56.648 --> 00:39:59.250]  I've heard this talk that they're supposedly in some secret alliance.
[00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.411]  I don't buy it.
[00:40:00.411 --> 00:40:02.593]  I don't want to put all my hope into any one man.
[00:40:02.593 --> 00:40:09.078]  I think I put it into the people working, you know, through God's will to restore our republic and, you know, fix our planet.
[00:40:09.078 --> 00:40:14.162]  But I'm just asking the Democrats, what are you thinking?
[00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:17.725]  Because indicting Trump will ensure he gets the nomination.
[00:40:17.725 --> 00:40:18.145]  And so
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.241]  Why are they doing it?
[00:40:20.241 --> 00:40:22.223]  Well, I don't think they're working with Trump.
[00:40:22.223 --> 00:40:23.164]  I've been around these people.
[00:40:23.164 --> 00:40:24.586]  I've dealt with them myself.
[00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:28.430]  They are completely crazed and hate Trump's guts.
[00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:37.940]  And so, just like Hillary, it came out, told the networks, I want you to make Trump the front runner because she thought she could beat him easily.
[00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:40.833]  And he beat her.
[00:40:40.833 --> 00:40:44.176]  So Trump never ran for office, ran once and won.
[00:40:44.176 --> 00:40:48.680]  And I think the way things are going, we're going to end up with Trump as president again.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:58.408]  My concerns are the way he energizes the left to commit even more crimes than usual, just to try to spite the country.
[00:40:58.408 --> 00:41:02.832]  So I think we're in for an incredible next few years, my friend.
[00:41:02.832 --> 00:41:03.793]  Thank you for the call.
[00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:07.016]  Brandon in Georgia, what's your view on the looming Trump indictment?
[00:41:08.386 --> 00:41:09.267]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:09.267 --> 00:41:10.167]  Honored to talk to you.
[00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:12.468]  I'm a first-time caller.
[00:41:12.468 --> 00:41:20.232]  I really haven't heard anybody make this point or argument, this conundrum, with the Secret Service and the U.S.
[00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:24.794]  Code to protect the President at all times.
[00:41:24.794 --> 00:41:27.675]  If he gets arrested, how is that going to conflict with
[00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:35.827]  Well, that's part of the discussion, is you have federal laws that are very strong and very established on this.
[00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:40.949]  So they're talking about the Secret Service staying with him in his jail cell.
[00:41:40.949 --> 00:41:52.975]  And they're saying if he actually went to prison for it, they'd have to create a special wing or a special area, and that the Secret Service would guard him and live with him.
[00:41:52.975 --> 00:41:53.695]  Okay, yeah.
[00:41:53.695 --> 00:41:55.456]  That's one thing I was thinking about.
[00:41:55.456 --> 00:41:57.837]  They couldn't just throw him in, you know, General Pop.
[00:41:59.076 --> 00:42:07.482]  Well, whether it was the Roman Empire or any other empire or Napoleon, they didn't throw Napoleon in jail, they locked him on an island with his own troops.
[00:42:07.482 --> 00:42:13.087]  Twice, once he escaped and the other time they didn't give him 200 troops, gave him like five so he couldn't escape.
[00:42:13.087 --> 00:42:19.472]  But yeah, I mean, this is a precedent where elites don't like to lock up other elites and set the precedent where they can be locked up.
[00:42:19.472 --> 00:42:23.094]  That's why this is so dangerous and I'm not even against elites being punished.
[00:42:23.094 --> 00:42:24.976]  But what I'm saying is once you let the
[00:42:25.796 --> 00:42:27.478]  Genie out of the bottle.
[00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:31.684]  Once Pandora's Box is open, this always leads to a country collapsing.
[00:42:31.684 --> 00:42:35.228]  That's why all these other experts are saying that, because this is really bad.
[00:42:35.228 --> 00:42:37.191]  It's another sign of how sick this country is.
[00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:39.970]  I totally agree.
[00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.871]  And that's the only point I wanted to bring up, sir.
[00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:42.751]  I appreciate your time.
[00:42:42.751 --> 00:42:45.513]  I appreciate you getting in on the show.
[00:42:45.513 --> 00:42:47.194]  Welcome as a first-time caller.
[00:42:47.194 --> 00:42:48.254]  Glad to have you.
[00:42:48.254 --> 00:42:48.835]  We're going to go to break.
[00:42:48.835 --> 00:42:52.297]  I'm going to connect with Jefferson, Angela, Baldy, Patrick, and others.
[00:42:52.297 --> 00:42:57.679]  Then Robert Barnes has got a lot to say on this subject and more in the second hour.
[00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:00.361]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:00.361 --> 00:43:05.704]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[00:43:07.301 --> 00:43:11.306]  Dr. Jones Natural's Turmeric Toothpaste that just came into stock.
[00:43:11.306 --> 00:43:14.590]  And I gotta tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.554]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth, is insane.
[00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:22.960]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and does such great things for the body.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.741]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[00:43:26.741 --> 00:43:27.941]  It is just dynamite.
[00:43:27.941 --> 00:43:32.543]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:36.764]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:43:36.764 --> 00:43:39.245]  Dr. Jones Naturals Turmeric Toothpaste.

[00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:02.239]  InfoWars.

[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.101]  This is their big move.
[00:44:05.993 --> 00:44:09.798]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:44:09.798 --> 00:44:11.500]  He doesn't care.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.741]  That's not his job.
[00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:14.503]  He's not the president of the United States.
[00:44:14.503 --> 00:44:18.368]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:44:18.368 --> 00:44:22.873]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:44:22.873 --> 00:44:23.975]  They must be opposed.
[00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:28.013]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:44:28.013 --> 00:44:29.193]  No.
[00:44:29.193 --> 00:44:30.034]  No.
[00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:30.794]  No.
[00:44:30.794 --> 00:44:31.694]  Exactly.
[00:44:31.694 --> 00:44:35.256]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:38.358]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:44:38.358 --> 00:44:40.839]  We say no to you taking our firearms.

[00:44:46.962 --> 00:44:49.483]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:44:49.483 --> 00:44:49.883]  You're right.
[00:44:50.163 --> 00:44:54.906]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[00:44:54.906 --> 00:45:04.252]  And we say no to your war!
[00:45:04.252 --> 00:45:06.014]  This is their big move.
[00:45:06.014 --> 00:45:09.816]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:45:09.816 --> 00:45:11.517]  He doesn't care.
[00:45:11.517 --> 00:45:12.778]  That's not his job.
[00:45:12.778 --> 00:45:14.519]  He's not the president of the United States.
[00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:17.061]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:45:18.368 --> 00:45:22.866]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:45:22.866 --> 00:45:24.031]  They must be opposed.
[00:45:24.745 --> 00:45:28.027]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:45:28.027 --> 00:45:29.208]  No.
[00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:30.048]  No.
[00:45:30.048 --> 00:45:30.809]  No.
[00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:31.709]  Exactly.
[00:45:31.709 --> 00:45:35.271]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:38.373]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.

[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:49.900]  You're right.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.923]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!

[00:47:01.628 --> 00:47:07.492]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:29.474]  Warrior Calls coming up here on the Alex Jones Show, but first, here's a couple minutes of what Governor DeSantis said about the looming indictment of former president, who really is the current president, Donald John Trump.
[00:47:29.474 --> 00:47:40.638]  We wanted to know what your thoughts are on the rumored Trump indictment, and if you have any role in it, if charges are brought on him, will you have any role in extradition to New York?
[00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:47.378]  So, I've seen rumors swirl, I have not seen any facts yet, and so I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:47:47.378 --> 00:47:53.324]  But I do know this, the Manhattan District Attorney is a Soros-funded prosecutor.
[00:47:53.324 --> 00:48:06.476]  And so, he, like other Soros-funded prosecutors, they weaponize their office to impose a political agenda on society at the expense of the rule of law and public safety.
[00:48:06.896 --> 00:48:11.399]  He has downgraded over 50% of the felonies to misdemeanors.
[00:48:11.399 --> 00:48:16.942]  He says he doesn't want to even have jail time for the vast, vast majority of crimes.
[00:48:16.942 --> 00:48:23.246]  And what we've seen in Manhattan is we've seen the crime rate go up, and we've seen citizens become less safe.
[00:48:23.246 --> 00:48:34.152]  And so, you're talking about this situation with, and look, I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.
[00:48:34.152 --> 00:48:35.513]  I just, I can't speak to that.
[00:48:36.994 --> 00:49:02.879]  But what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction, and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, you know, that's an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office.
[00:49:02.879 --> 00:49:05.120]  And I think that that's fundamentally wrong.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:28.555]  I also think it's important to point out when you're talking about these Soros-funded prosecutors, yes, they may do a high-profile politicized prosecution, and that's bad, but the real victims are ordinary New Yorkers, ordinary Americans in all these different jurisdictions, that they get victimized every day because of the reckless political agenda
[00:49:28.855 --> 00:49:29.115]  Absolutely.
[00:49:29.115 --> 00:49:37.302]  I mean, we talk about Russians meddling in our election when they can't even know how to run their own country and not put them down, which is true.
[00:49:57.199 --> 00:50:00.000]  That Putin can't even administer half this country, it's so big.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:11.484]  The Chinese have infiltrated us big time, Chinese communists, but the left, these multinational think tanks and corporations, like Soros' Open Society, they have really taken us over.
[00:50:11.484 --> 00:50:17.406]  And I have gotten to enjoy Soros-funded judges and people here in Austin with all the rigged stuff we've gone through.
[00:50:17.406 --> 00:50:23.468]  And I mean, these people literally hate the rule of law and due process, and they're tyrants.
[00:50:25.948 --> 00:50:29.451]  On its face, what Soros has done is illegal.
[00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:37.417]  It's a multi-national crime group that controls almost every major DA in the country.
[00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:39.499]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:50:39.499 --> 00:50:43.422]  Jefferson in Virginia, go ahead and thanks for calling.
[00:50:43.422 --> 00:50:47.325]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:50:47.325 --> 00:50:47.525]  Go ahead.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:51:06.250]  I'm fine that we're not supposed to indict former presidents when they haven't done anything wrong for any significant crime, but we sort of dropped the ball on Woodrow Wilson when he signed into law the unconstitutional Federal Banking Act to create the Federal Reserve.
[00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.011]  The Supreme Court should have stepped in on that.
[00:51:08.011 --> 00:51:12.414]  We should have like a national grand jury that can make the Supreme Court
[00:51:13.406 --> 00:51:16.627]  Hold presidents accountable for doing things that are unconstitutional office.
[00:51:16.627 --> 00:51:18.628]  No, no, I agree presidents should not be above the law.
[00:51:18.628 --> 00:51:20.068]  It's why we have impeachment.
[00:51:20.068 --> 00:51:22.689]  It's why we have Congress with the checks and balances of laws.
[00:51:22.689 --> 00:51:25.470]  And it's why we have the Supreme Court.
[00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:31.612]  I mean, I agree that we, I'm just saying you can't have an average DA indict a president.
[00:51:31.612 --> 00:51:34.793]  I mean, it's, it's just, it just, it creates a constitutional crisis.
[00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:41.570]  Yeah, it should happen at a much higher level, and the people should be behind the indictment, not some DA.
[00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:45.793]  But Lyndon Johnson certainly should have been indicted for JFK's assassination.
[00:51:45.793 --> 00:51:48.535]  There should have been a criminal investigation at the highest level.
[00:51:48.535 --> 00:51:58.301]  And that was a good DA, Jim Garrison, doing what he did, but he was trying to indict the minions under it to then trigger a federal investigation.
[00:51:58.301 --> 00:52:00.843]  But he himself was not trying to indict LBJ.
[00:52:02.583 --> 00:52:03.023]  Right.
[00:52:03.023 --> 00:52:06.446]  He was trying to work up the chain, so to speak.
[00:52:06.446 --> 00:52:10.189]  But yeah, we need some remedy to this.
[00:52:10.189 --> 00:52:14.112]  We're behind the curve on this, really.
[00:52:14.112 --> 00:52:15.013]  No, I agree with you.
[00:52:15.013 --> 00:52:18.556]  But what do you think the deep state's thinking to indict Trump?
[00:52:18.556 --> 00:52:22.719]  I mean, anybody knows that's going to supercharge him and get him even more support.
[00:52:22.719 --> 00:52:23.440]  Why are they doing that?
[00:52:25.243 --> 00:52:28.127]  I can't figure out the logic of why they're trying to push this forward.
[00:52:28.127 --> 00:52:29.849]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:52:29.849 --> 00:52:32.993]  It only emboldens his base.
[00:52:32.993 --> 00:52:35.136]  I don't get it myself.
[00:52:35.136 --> 00:52:36.778]  They're panicking, I guess.
[00:52:36.778 --> 00:52:37.619]  I just don't think they're...
[00:52:38.277 --> 00:52:42.301]  They're aware of what they're doing in terms of what their plan is in the long run.
[00:52:42.301 --> 00:52:46.745]  They're just sort of ad hoc doing this flying by their seat of their pants.
[00:52:46.745 --> 00:52:48.787]  Just like the war with Russia.
[00:52:48.787 --> 00:52:51.609]  Eight months ago, Biden's like, we can't send in Abrams tanks.
[00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:52.410]  That's World War III.
[00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.351]  Then he does it.
[00:52:53.351 --> 00:52:53.831]  Exactly.
[00:52:53.831 --> 00:52:55.833]  They're out of control.
[00:52:55.833 --> 00:52:56.754]  It's so dangerous.
[00:52:56.754 --> 00:52:58.896]  I appreciate your call.
[00:52:58.896 --> 00:53:02.119]  Angela in Wisconsin, thanks for calling.
[00:53:02.119 --> 00:53:02.900]  Good morning, Alec.
[00:53:03.709 --> 00:53:24.863]  I heard the tail end of Harrison's show today, and he did point out something I didn't know, which is that DeSantis actually has the power to stop them from extraditing Trump from Florida for this indictment.
[00:53:24.863 --> 00:53:26.784]  I'm not sure if I'm saying it right.
[00:53:26.784 --> 00:53:30.266]  No, he does have the power to block the extradition.
[00:53:30.266 --> 00:53:31.567]  But I would expect Trump...
[00:53:33.271 --> 00:53:35.032]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:53:35.032 --> 00:54:01.441]  I'm sorry, that is so significant that I believe, you know, I actually emailed DeSantis, and I pointed that out, and since I started that article about Maxine Waters, I did a true social thing on there, and I had heard or seen video, on-band video, about Soros.
[00:54:02.381 --> 00:54:06.183]  An interview on 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace.
[00:54:06.183 --> 00:54:08.083]  Now, I couldn't find it.
[00:54:08.083 --> 00:54:10.024]  I was strapped for time.
[00:54:10.024 --> 00:54:13.305]  My mind was, you know, this popped in my head.
[00:54:13.305 --> 00:54:16.527]  So I went to YouTube, and I found the full interview.
[00:54:16.527 --> 00:54:19.528]  The one you have is a segment of it.
[00:54:19.528 --> 00:54:23.169]  So I listened to it, and it is so revealing, Alex.
[00:54:23.169 --> 00:54:29.512]  The full one's even better, of how Soros, from age 14, he was trained by Nazis.
[00:54:32.634 --> 00:54:42.482]  And he is a self-professed, God-rejecting, and like, it's kind of cool because he's real honest and open about who he is and what he is.
[00:54:42.482 --> 00:54:59.817]  I mean, and Mike Wallace is just interviewing him saying, okay, so on one hand, it's okay for you to wield your power up with money to do what you think is good, but on the other hand, there's so much
[00:55:01.529 --> 00:55:09.954]  And then Soros goes on to say, well if I don't do these evil things, somebody else will.
[00:55:09.954 --> 00:55:17.597]  So he goes, I don't mean to be evil, but it's just the way the market works, so I'm going to fill this place, and it was the best time of my life rounding up Jews.
[00:55:17.597 --> 00:55:21.839]  Yeah, actually, up until about a year ago, they would never allow it on YouTube.
[00:55:21.839 --> 00:55:25.061]  And no one could find the full Soros clip, and all we had was pieces.
[00:55:25.061 --> 00:55:28.583]  I noticed about a year ago, it went back on YouTube, and the whole
[00:55:29.343 --> 00:55:33.367]  15-minute interview is there and it's just mind-blowing.
[00:55:33.367 --> 00:55:38.251]  In fact, I meant when I saw it last year to come and play the whole thing here on air.
[00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:40.252]  I never got around to it, but you're absolutely right.
[00:55:40.252 --> 00:55:42.434]  Last time I checked, that whole thing is there.
[00:55:42.434 --> 00:55:43.355]  I've never seen the whole thing.
[00:55:43.355 --> 00:55:45.717]  It's even worse than the two minutes we had.
[00:55:45.717 --> 00:55:46.278]  Thanks for the call.
[00:55:48.052 --> 00:55:53.316]  All right, Patrick, Baldy, and others will take your calls when Robert Barnes is on with us on the same subject.
[00:55:53.316 --> 00:56:02.261]  More calls, we'll go ahead and open the phones up for more callers on the Trump indictment, the constitutional crisis, 2024 elections, and all the things that are unfolding.
[00:56:02.261 --> 00:56:04.063]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[00:56:04.063 --> 00:56:13.089]  I wasn't going to take too many calls, but now that I think about it, I think Barnes will like to take some calls on this subject.
[00:56:14.149 --> 00:56:16.511]  So, 877-789-2539.
[00:56:16.511 --> 00:56:18.893]  Please remember, we're not funded by Jordan Sorrells and the Globals.
[00:56:18.893 --> 00:56:20.854]  We're funded by you.
[00:56:20.854 --> 00:56:27.899]  And when you make the decision to go to InfoWareStore.com and get great, life-empowering products, it also funds this operation, which changes the world.
[00:56:27.899 --> 00:56:35.124]  So, it is a default position for me, in my mind, that you would want to get these great products, and you'd want to keep us on the air.
[00:56:35.124 --> 00:56:36.025]  So, please take action.
[00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:37.066]  I want to thank those of you that have.
[00:56:37.066 --> 00:56:40.628]  I want to encourage those of you that have never gone to InfoWareStore.com to go there.
[00:56:40.628 --> 00:56:41.429]  And maybe you don't want
[00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:46.484]  Tumeric 95, the strongest curcuminoid product out there.
[00:57:12.801 --> 00:57:14.723]  But maybe you just want to make a straight donation.
[00:57:14.723 --> 00:57:15.923]  Just donate up at the top.
[00:57:15.923 --> 00:57:16.364]  $5, $10, $100, $20.
[00:57:16.364 --> 00:57:23.329]  You can do a recurring donation every month or every two months in your profile.
[00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:24.669]  Cancel anytime.
[00:57:24.669 --> 00:57:27.952]  Anytime you set up for auto-ship for a product you like, we'll be able to give you a later date.
[00:57:27.952 --> 00:57:29.813]  You get 10% off on that as well.
[00:57:29.813 --> 00:57:30.934]  A lot of great products.
[00:57:30.934 --> 00:57:32.815]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:32.815 --> 00:57:36.117]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:57:36.117 --> 00:57:37.778]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:37.778 --> 00:57:39.480]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:50.059]  I've got a little report I'm going to play when we come back dealing with critical race theory.
[00:57:50.059 --> 00:57:52.701]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:57:58.168 --> 00:57:59.550]  I want you all to know something.
[00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.533]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:05.078]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[00:58:05.078 --> 00:58:08.023]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:58:08.023 --> 00:58:12.469]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[00:58:12.469 --> 00:58:14.212]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:58:14.632 --> 00:58:18.154]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:58:18.154 --> 00:58:21.896]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:58:21.896 --> 00:58:24.758]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:58:24.758 --> 00:58:25.798]  Years ago.
[00:58:25.798 --> 00:58:27.879]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:29.880]  Not for a second.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.382]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:58:32.382 --> 00:58:34.863]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:58:34.863 --> 00:58:37.984]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:58:37.984 --> 00:58:42.627]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:58:52.242 --> 00:58:58.646]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[00:58:58.646 --> 00:59:00.387]  World War III has already started.
[00:59:00.387 --> 00:59:02.709]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[00:59:02.709 --> 00:59:03.869]  There's mass censorship.
[00:59:03.869 --> 00:59:06.091]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[00:59:06.091 --> 00:59:08.352]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[00:59:08.352 --> 00:59:12.735]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[00:59:12.995 --> 00:59:16.937]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[00:59:16.937 --> 00:59:25.342]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting great products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:59:25.342 --> 00:59:34.007]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out, or the great reset in the War for the World, or ultimate bone broth, finally back in stock after over two years, it's all available at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:59:34.007 --> 00:59:35.628]  These are truly amazing products.
[00:59:35.788 --> 00:59:41.973]  So, get your InfoWars products at InfoWarsStore.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcast on the air.
[00:59:41.973 --> 00:59:51.662]  It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air, so please take action now at InfoWarsStore.
[00:59:51.662 --> 00:59:57.567]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.784 --> 01:00:23.803]  So, the big think tanks, the UN, all of them are funding critical race theory, not just here but around the Western world, that whites are inherently bad people.
[01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:29.414]  Then they bring in giant third world populations and brainwash them that white people are inherently bad.
[01:00:29.414 --> 01:00:31.095]  That's replacement migration.
[01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:36.296]  That's an official UN plan going back 15 years that you now see being implemented.
[01:00:36.296 --> 01:00:39.677]  But the ADL and others say arrest anybody that talks about it.
[01:00:39.677 --> 01:00:41.118]  It doesn't exist.
[01:00:41.118 --> 01:00:42.478]  Well, yes, it does exist.
[01:00:42.478 --> 01:00:44.799]  And here's just a few examples in their own words.
[01:00:46.095 --> 01:00:52.962]  Officials believe the gunman accused of the mass shooting in Buffalo was inspired by the white replacement conspiracy theory.
[01:00:52.962 --> 01:01:00.290]  Now this is a baseless belief that white people are being slowly but intentionally replaced by minorities and immigrants.
[01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:06.136]  The concept was once a fringe theory but now it's embraced by many Republican lawmakers and Fox hosts.
[01:01:06.676 --> 01:01:11.882]  There's no economic justification whatsoever for these levels of immigration.
[01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:15.626]  And of course, immigration destabilizes your society.
[01:01:15.626 --> 01:01:17.407]  It makes it far less cohesive.
[01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:18.308]  That's always true.
[01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.170]  It doesn't matter where they're coming from.
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:23.474]  If you have a ton of new people, you're less cohesive.
[01:01:23.474 --> 01:01:24.155]  So why are they coming?
[01:01:24.155 --> 01:01:25.716]  Well, there's only one reason.
[01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:27.979]  Because the Democratic Party wants new voters.
[01:01:28.953 --> 01:01:29.755]  Period.
[01:01:29.755 --> 01:01:35.806]  What was once a fringe white supremacist conspiracy theory has now become mainstream.
[01:01:38.803 --> 01:01:42.706]  The theory has been amplified by voices on Fox News.
[01:01:42.706 --> 01:01:45.007]  I mean, everyone wants to make a racial issue out of it.
[01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:46.688]  Ooh, the, you know, white replacement theory.
[01:01:46.688 --> 01:01:47.609]  No, no, no.
[01:01:47.609 --> 01:01:50.071]  This is a voting rights question.
[01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:54.594]  I have less political power because they're importing a brand new electorate.
[01:01:54.594 --> 01:01:56.255]  Why should I sit back and take that?
[01:01:56.255 --> 01:02:04.100]  The racist anti-immigrant theory that says non-white immigrants are being brought to replace America's white population.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.841]  That's not a racist conspiracy.
[01:02:05.841 --> 01:02:06.682]  It's a racist conspiracy.
[01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:07.902]  No, it's not.
[01:02:07.902 --> 01:02:08.443]  It's true.
[01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:17.970]  And we know that it's true, not because we heard on Alex Jones, but because leading Democrats have said so repeatedly in public for years.
[01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:27.318]  It seems harder and harder to ignore that the echoes of replacement theory and other racially motivated views are increasingly coming out into the open.
[01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:30.560]  In a few years we're going to be a majority brown country.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.881]  White people will not be the majority in the country anymore.
[01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:40.565]  This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a minority of the generation at some point.
[01:02:40.565 --> 01:02:46.068]  As of 2007, every year babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority.
[01:02:46.068 --> 01:02:48.669]  In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.
[01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:53.773]  As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which is coming.
[01:02:53.773 --> 01:02:55.454]  Demographics is destiny.
[01:02:55.454 --> 01:02:56.935]  Demographics is destiny.
[01:02:56.935 --> 01:02:58.837]  Demographics is destiny, right?
[01:02:58.837 --> 01:03:00.118]  The country is changing.
[01:03:00.118 --> 01:03:05.382]  I've been saying it here, other people have been saying it here for years now, even before Donald Trump.
[01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:07.804]  The demographics is destiny.
[01:03:07.804 --> 01:03:15.610]  The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.
[01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:18.272]  So we live in a country where the demographics are changing, it's becoming less white.
[01:03:19.219 --> 01:03:19.680]  Correct.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.221]  Okay.
[01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:22.123]  Whites will not be the majority.
[01:03:22.123 --> 01:03:26.809]  I mean, that's, it's an exciting transformation of the country.
[01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:31.595]  It's an exciting evolution and, you know, progress of our country in many different ways.
[01:03:31.595 --> 01:03:33.858]  The white population is declining.
[01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:37.508]  It was always on the upswing.
[01:03:37.508 --> 01:03:41.470]  So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.
[01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:48.734]  It speaks to how that population will, the demographics, will weigh in politically.
[01:03:48.734 --> 01:03:55.679]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the Dreamers, and all of them.
[01:03:55.679 --> 01:04:04.024]  Because our ultimate goal is to help the Dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[01:04:05.025 --> 01:04:12.032]  Fewer than 50% of the people in America, from then and on, will be white European stock.
[01:04:12.032 --> 01:04:16.797]  They say out loud, we are doing this because it helps us to win elections.
[01:04:16.797 --> 01:04:20.781]  That's not something they've said once, it's something they've gloated about again and again.
[01:04:21.421 --> 01:04:24.703]  In a couple of presidential cycles, you'll be on election night.
[01:04:24.703 --> 01:04:30.706]  You'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic nominee for president.
[01:04:30.706 --> 01:04:31.786]  It's changing.
[01:04:31.786 --> 01:04:35.488]  It's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of the demographics.
[01:04:35.488 --> 01:04:37.089]  Demographics is destiny.
[01:04:37.089 --> 01:04:38.450]  Call out Tucker Carlson.
[01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:41.851]  Call out the politicians and make this, make them own it.
[01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:43.893]  This is a Republican platform.
[01:04:43.893 --> 01:04:46.654]  It's the racist Republican replacement theory.
[01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:51.511]  So you play clips of them saying it, and you're the deranged conspiracy nut!
[01:05:00.213 --> 01:05:03.636]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[01:05:03.636 --> 01:05:05.397]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[01:05:05.397 --> 01:05:14.484]  But they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down Infowars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others.
[01:05:14.484 --> 01:05:16.286]  So please, pray for us now more than ever.

[01:06:16.633 --> 01:06:24.517]  Well-known constitutional lawyer and, of course, Republican brain.
[01:06:25.805 --> 01:06:26.725]  Insider, you can call him.
[01:06:26.725 --> 01:06:28.546]  Robert Barnes joins us for the balance of the hour.
[01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:35.049]  We'll also take some calls with the loaded phone lines on the one subject of the looming Trump indictment.
[01:06:35.049 --> 01:06:35.989]  Is it really going to happen?
[01:06:35.989 --> 01:06:38.330]  Is it going to be over Stormy Daniels?
[01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:44.613]  Why are the Democrats at a state level doing this when the Feds declined not to do it?
[01:06:44.613 --> 01:06:48.694]  The issue of the statute of limitations, just all of it is so important.
[01:06:48.694 --> 01:06:52.036]  Trey Gowdy says the Manhattan DA case against Trump
[01:06:53.012 --> 01:06:55.213]  Risk the demise of our country.
[01:06:55.213 --> 01:07:02.037]  And I agree, but we're going to explain with an expert on the history of this legally, Robert Barnes, joining us.
[01:07:02.037 --> 01:07:03.678]  Robert, great to have you on with us.
[01:07:03.678 --> 01:07:06.320]  I've been watching a lot of your work since you were on a few weeks ago.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.721]  You've been killing it.
[01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:08.821]  And so congratulations.
[01:07:08.821 --> 01:07:11.903]  You've always been successful for many years, but you've really been nailing it.
[01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:15.886]  I see you everywhere with massive following increasing, which is a good thing.
[01:07:15.886 --> 01:07:18.527]  We need more smart people to be more prominent.
[01:07:18.527 --> 01:07:20.108]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[01:07:20.108 --> 01:07:21.269]  Let's tackle into this.
[01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:32.172]  Then obviously it ties into Ukraine, it ties into the banks, it ties into Sam Harris and the Democrats saying, yeah, we're for censorship, big deal, get used to it, you don't deserve to have a voice.
[01:07:32.172 --> 01:07:43.096]  And the incredible hearings in the last few weeks in Congress with the admitted weaponization and surveillance and censorship, and for me it's not a First Amendment issue, that's a side issue, it's an important issue.
[01:07:43.096 --> 01:07:49.078]  The organized nature of intelligence agencies with government, with think tanks, with big tech, with dinosaur media,
[01:07:49.818 --> 01:07:55.164]  Working to surveil, censor, and then deplatform and debank people.
[01:07:55.164 --> 01:07:57.566]  To me, that's racketeering, but you've got the legal brain.
[01:07:57.566 --> 01:07:59.168]  I want to get your finer point on that.
[01:07:59.168 --> 01:08:00.129]  So, Robert, great to have you with us.
[01:08:01.975 --> 01:08:03.196]  Absolutely.
[01:08:03.196 --> 01:08:10.242]  I mean, the bottom line is the deep state isn't going to indict Trump in order to get DeSantis to challenge Trump.
[01:08:10.242 --> 01:08:15.707]  That's the story that's not being fully told or has been fully vetted yet, but will start to come out over.
[01:08:15.707 --> 01:08:18.290]  And DeSantis' statement today is revelatory of that.
[01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:25.176]  The fact he's not going to use his Florida governor's powers to even protest or contest such an indictment and arrest.
[01:08:25.176 --> 01:08:28.779]  He's going to pretend that it's inconsequential, that it's a sideshow, that it's a circus.
[01:08:29.459 --> 01:08:29.880]  I think?
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.523]  That got him to reverse was, hey Trump's going to be taken out by criminal indictments.
[01:08:53.523 --> 01:08:55.764]  That's going to pave a path for you to run.
[01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:58.506]  Don't align with Trump because that's a dead path.
[01:08:58.506 --> 01:09:01.427]  Challenge Trump because Trump's going to be DOA.
[01:09:01.427 --> 01:09:03.869]  We're going to guarantee it because he's going to get indicted.
[01:09:04.449 --> 01:09:07.513]  And they launched four different criminal investigations against them.
[01:09:07.513 --> 01:09:13.640]  They did Mar-a-Lago classified documents, Georgia election issues, January 6th, and New York.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.886]  And New York was dead because career prosecutors looked at the case in New York and said, there's no case here.
[01:09:19.386 --> 01:09:24.050]  And so they said, don't worry, we got Mar-a-Lago, we got January 6th, we got Georgia.
[01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:27.673]  But then, of course, Mar-a-Lago blew up on him by the public backlash.
[01:09:27.673 --> 01:09:36.341]  Not only that, Mar-a-Lago blew up on him again when White Hats and the FBI disclosed how Biden had even more classified documents, by any estimation.
[01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:38.583]  Biden is the only one to commit a real crime in this context.
[01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.065]  So that made that case die on the vine.
[01:09:41.065 --> 01:09:44.568]  No, but they couldn't get anybody to flip in either Georgia or the D.C.
[01:09:44.568 --> 01:09:47.151]  cases to give a credible case against Trump.
[01:09:47.151 --> 01:09:54.817]  And the grand jury person is a complete nutjob who went on CNN and even no less than Anderson Cooper admitted she was a nutjob.
[01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:56.359]  So that killed those cases.
[01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.261]  So they went back to the Soros elected D.A.
[01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:02.004]  out of New York and said, buddy, you got to revive that dead case.
[01:10:02.444 --> 01:10:08.512]  So he removed the career prosecutors from the case, put on these heavily political prosecutors on the case.
[01:10:08.512 --> 01:10:11.735]  I know some of the career prosecutors who said no to the case.
[01:10:11.735 --> 01:10:13.818]  And they said there's no basis for it.
[01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:15.440]  It's outside the statute of limitations.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.803]  It's a made-up, manufactured criminal allegation.
[01:10:18.624 --> 01:10:38.344]  But they have to go forward with it because it's the only way they can trick DeSantis into making political suicide by challenging Trump because they think the only way to take out Trump is to get DeSantis to weaken him so much in the primaries that even if Trump wins in the primaries he's beaten up and vulnerable by the time of the general election.
[01:10:38.744 --> 01:10:41.526]  And they want to take out DeSantis at the same time.
[01:10:41.526 --> 01:10:53.014]  This was how they tricked and deceived DeSantis, because after DeSantis went rogue on the pandemic in terms of deep state priorities, they decided they could no longer trust him.
[01:10:53.014 --> 01:11:00.599]  And even though he'd been a deep state recruited candidate going back to Guantanamo and Harvard and Yale and prep school and the fraternities tied to Skull and Bones,
[01:11:01.119 --> 01:11:07.024]  He proved that his working class roots and his political pragmatism could go populist at key junctures.
[01:11:07.024 --> 01:11:08.506]  So they no longer trusted him.
[01:11:08.506 --> 01:11:09.707]  So they thought, this is genius.
[01:11:09.707 --> 01:11:11.729]  At a minimum, we get to take out DeSantis.
[01:11:11.729 --> 01:11:17.714]  Maybe we take out DeSantis and Trump, but the linchpin to all of it is a bogus criminal indictment.
[01:11:17.714 --> 01:11:20.016]  And all they have left is the Stormy Daniels case.
[01:11:20.456 --> 01:11:38.623]  But as Clinton, we lived through it, when a desperate political prosecutor resorts to just charging sex crimes, people tend to rally to the victim of that accusation, rather than rally to the prosecutor's side, as Bill Clinton proved in 1998.
[01:11:38.623 --> 01:11:44.745]  By reducing Bill Clinton's crimes to just a sex crime, he actually rebounded in political popularity.
[01:11:44.745 --> 01:11:48.807]  Democrats did great in the 98 midterm elections, to everybody's shock and surprise.
[01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:59.249]  And so I think the Empire is going to strike back tomorrow with an indictment on Donald Trump, but it will be the beginning of the return of the Jedi and the resurrection of Trump's career.
[01:11:59.249 --> 01:12:08.071]  And maybe DeSantis will get wise and realize he needs to not take the bait and challenge Trump in the first place because he would only be doing the deep states bidding.
[01:12:08.071 --> 01:12:12.052]  And the numbers show that this is going to supercharge Trump.
[01:12:13.456 --> 01:12:17.200]  But it again shows the clear desperation of these people.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:30.092]  And every criminal case they've tried to launch against Trump, right at the magic moment, then FBI whistleblowers release info basically showing it's a fraud or showing things Democrats have done a thousand times worse.
[01:12:30.092 --> 01:12:32.234]  But look, Bill Clinton was not really popular.
[01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:33.816]  A lot of people.
[01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.818]  He was a bad guy.
[01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:42.684]  But they still went after him on sex crimes because they didn't want to go after him on other issues because Republicans were involved in a lot of the same issues.
[01:12:42.684 --> 01:12:45.807]  But with Trump, this is a grown woman.
[01:12:45.807 --> 01:12:51.612]  There's not allegations that he was beating them or attacking them or raping them like Bill Clinton likes to do.
[01:12:52.776 --> 01:12:54.980]  But what about the Statute of Limitations?
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:06.499]  If this happened seven years ago, and right when the statutes were almost up two years ago, the last group, as you pointed out, New York, declined, the feds declined, then how are they doing this outside the Statute of Limitations?
[01:13:08.226 --> 01:13:16.767]  They're just gambling that the grand jury will indict a ham sandwich, particularly in Manhattan, so they know they won't pay attention and put a block and stop to the case.
[01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:25.069]  They're gambling that a New York state court judge, and there's reasons to think they're right, will play ball with the prosecution.
[01:13:25.069 --> 01:13:33.610]  And so the theory they're going to use is the idea that Trump was both unavailable to be indicted and outside the state, and they need to prove both.
[01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:37.391]  They need to prove they couldn't find him for purposes of indictment and that he was unavailable.
[01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:44.258]  There are some bad cases out there in New York case law that can could allow this, but it's not what the law is supposed to be.
[01:13:44.258 --> 01:13:52.647]  So what they're really gambling on is that they'll get a political enough judge that will let Trump not get to dismiss the indictment.
[01:13:53.047 --> 01:13:58.170]  Drag out the case, and again, I think their real goal isn't even to get a conviction in this case.
[01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:04.835]  Their real goal is to trick DeSantis into challenging Trump, thinking that the New York indictment will be enough to derail Trump.
[01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:17.183]  And isn't it also meant to have the first guy jump off the bridge, the first lemming of the Soros DA, to encourage other investigations that have stalled, because they're not a case, to go ahead and file their indictments and try to swarm Trump?
[01:14:18.914 --> 01:14:20.175]  Oh yeah, no doubt about this.
[01:14:20.175 --> 01:14:26.199]  I mean, they're desperate to take out Trump, but the primary strategy they have is to get DeSantis to challenge him.
[01:14:26.199 --> 01:14:30.002]  The backup strategy is to just weaponize the legal system everywhere.
[01:14:30.002 --> 01:14:31.523]  I mean, they did this to him his whole term.
[01:14:31.523 --> 01:14:35.045]  I mean, he was subject to several bogus criminal investigations.
[01:14:35.045 --> 01:14:38.627]  Remember, anytime he, like, some people were being critical of him relating to Ukraine.
[01:14:38.627 --> 01:14:45.312]  Well, anytime he tried to put a halt to aid to Ukraine, or sending money to Ukraine, or sending arms to Ukraine, they impeached him.
[01:14:45.733 --> 01:14:48.440]  I mean, so that was what the first impeachment was all about.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:48.982]  They neutered him.
[01:14:48.982 --> 01:14:49.524]  They neutered him.
[01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:51.351]  Completely.
[01:14:51.351 --> 01:15:02.094]  And even before that, they were scared of him reaching a rapprochement with Putin in Russia that would create an allied relationship with Russia to separate them from China.
[01:15:02.094 --> 01:15:08.336]  And we just saw this past week how Biden's strategy has backfired as he is hanging out in Moscow with Putin.
[01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:09.857]  And how did they do it?
[01:15:09.857 --> 01:15:11.257]  A bogus criminal investigation.
[01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.278]  Well, Robert, let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:15:13.278 --> 01:15:16.659]  But I want to finish up on the indictment situation.
[01:15:16.659 --> 01:15:19.920]  You do think, indeed, they're going to go ahead to spike these new witnesses today.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.802]  And they're going to go ahead and indict Trump tomorrow?
[01:15:23.802 --> 01:15:24.182]  Yes.
[01:15:24.182 --> 01:15:28.264]  I mean, they're already putting out the steel barriers outside the Manhattan courthouse.
[01:15:28.264 --> 01:15:31.126]  And they only do that when a high profile person is going to come in.
[01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:33.627]  I've been there like three different times where that's occurred.
[01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:39.371]  So when you see those barriers going up, it means they believe that tomorrow he's going to be indicted.
[01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:40.752]  Another question.
[01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:44.834]  Could it just be the Stormy Daniels or could there be surprise indictments?
[01:15:46.035 --> 01:15:51.278]  Syndicated talk show host, lawyer, good friend of mine, Robert Barnes, with us straight ahead.
[01:15:51.278 --> 01:15:52.459]  InfoWars.com.
[01:15:52.459 --> 01:15:55.141]  Tomorrow's news today, your calls and more coming up.
[01:15:55.141 --> 01:15:58.823]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.823 --> 01:16:02.205]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:08.338]  I want you all to know something.
[01:16:08.338 --> 01:16:10.279]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:13.821]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:16:13.821 --> 01:16:16.943]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:16:16.943 --> 01:16:21.206]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:23.407]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:16:23.407 --> 01:16:26.950]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:30.392]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.534]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:16:33.534 --> 01:16:34.554]  Years ago.
[01:16:34.554 --> 01:16:38.637]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:41.158]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:16:41.158 --> 01:16:43.619]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:16:43.619 --> 01:16:46.741]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:16:46.741 --> 01:16:51.384]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:16:58.945 --> 01:17:01.026]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[01:17:01.026 --> 01:17:04.326]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:04.907]  You know why?
[01:17:04.907 --> 01:17:06.387]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[01:17:06.387 --> 01:17:10.008]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:17:10.008 --> 01:17:13.529]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:16.910]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:17:18.991 --> 01:17:21.993]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:17:21.993 --> 01:17:23.493]  This is reality.
[01:17:23.493 --> 01:17:27.456]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:17:27.456 --> 01:17:29.697]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[01:17:29.697 --> 01:17:32.498]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[01:17:32.498 --> 01:17:33.739]  You're lying to the public.
[01:17:33.739 --> 01:17:34.760]  It's disgusting.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.861]  The media continues to misrepresent.
[01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:38.062]  What I've said.
[01:17:38.062 --> 01:17:41.086]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:17:41.086 --> 01:17:45.071]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[01:17:45.071 --> 01:17:47.033]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:49.036]  The biggest megaphone in the country.

[01:17:51.379 --> 01:17:52.440]  The things that matter!

[01:19:45.953 --> 01:19:47.714]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[01:19:47.714 --> 01:19:49.035]  So, get off the bench.
[01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:49.875]  Get in the game.
[01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:56.620]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now, and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:00.382 --> 01:20:05.003]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:05.003 --> 01:20:18.065]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:18.065 --> 01:20:22.646]  It's 1220 Central Time, broadcasting live from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[01:20:22.646 --> 01:20:24.806]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.806 --> 01:20:26.947]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.367]  Barnes, finishing up, I had that question before we
[01:20:31.129 --> 01:20:37.920]  I mean, I raised several big questions there, but why doesn't the deep state understand what even the ancients knew?
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:43.549]  That they're making martyrs out of people doing this, but they just can't help themselves.
[01:20:43.549 --> 01:20:45.252]  Why are they moving to indict Trump tomorrow?
[01:20:47.419 --> 01:20:54.884]  It's the primary objective is they figure they'll at least take out DeSantis because this is what was promised to DeSantis in order to induce DeSantis to run.
[01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:59.306]  And they figure they'll get at least that benefit even if it doesn't damage Trump.
[01:20:59.306 --> 01:21:01.387]  Secondly, they're delusional too, though.
[01:21:01.387 --> 01:21:02.688]  That can't be underestimated.
[01:21:02.868 --> 01:21:17.996]  In the same way that they believe constantly coming after you and coming after InfoWars will get the audience to go away, will get you to forfeit and give up and go sit in a ransom place and be quiet and not talk anymore, and it doesn't happen.
[01:21:17.996 --> 01:21:30.243]  Instead, the audience gets bigger, the audience grows stronger, the audience continues to go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy products that make the network stronger, that make the information stronger and make themselves personally healthier.
[01:21:30.783 --> 01:21:32.264]  Uh, they can't, they can't stop it.
[01:21:32.264 --> 01:21:41.888]  They can't stop the message, they can't stop the messenger, they can't stop the audience, and they should know that in fact it tends to backfire, but it's because they know that they tend to confession through projection.
[01:21:41.888 --> 01:21:48.211]  Just as they confess their own crimes, like you go through all the things they accuse Trump of, Biden is pretty much guilty of all the way through.
[01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:55.595]  You know, family criminality, corruption foreign overseas, corruption connected to Ukraine, World War III, all those things Biden is guilty of.
[01:21:56.015 --> 01:21:59.260]  When Trump has secret bank accounts and now they've got all his numbers, he doesn't.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:02.425]  The New York Times basically said, I have secret bank accounts of the Kamens.
[01:22:02.425 --> 01:22:04.749]  Totally made up, 100% not true, but they don't care.
[01:22:06.158 --> 01:22:07.099]  Oh, completely!
[01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:10.121]  And so I think that's the other aspect.
[01:22:10.121 --> 01:22:13.584]  They confess their own fears through projection.
[01:22:13.584 --> 01:22:24.634]  So they think that if they were in Trump's shoes and somebody came after them criminally, they would shut up, go silent, go mute, go quiet, play ball, do what the system tells them to do.
[01:22:24.634 --> 01:22:26.976]  And so they assume Trump would do the same.
[01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:28.997]  And they don't understand Trump will never do that.
[01:22:28.997 --> 01:22:33.321]  Trump's reaction to people coming after him is to fight back twice as hard.
[01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:38.226]  Trump's reaction to the Empire Strikes Back is going to be Return of the Jedi.
[01:22:38.226 --> 01:22:40.929]  We've seen this script before and that's who Trump is.
[01:22:40.929 --> 01:22:55.984]  They've never understood this because they can't understand Trump because they themselves are cowards and criminals and so they assume everybody else is a coward and a criminal and they act accordingly and when they discover otherwise they don't know what to do and that's why they're getting burned.
[01:22:58.832 --> 01:23:00.333]  I totally agree with you.
[01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:09.660]  How would you, before we get into the geopolitical issues, the banking issues, and take calls, describe the state of the left and the globalists worldwide?
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.481]  I mean, they have world government summits.
[01:23:11.481 --> 01:23:14.183]  Elon Musk rebukes them to their face.
[01:23:14.183 --> 01:23:17.226]  International polls show globalists are the most unpopular group.
[01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:20.208]  People now know they're the people in charge, ruining our lives.
[01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:21.489]  But they just keep doubling down.
[01:23:21.489 --> 01:23:24.111]  How would you describe this moment in history right now?
[01:23:26.184 --> 01:23:27.364]  You have a corrupt
[01:23:47.831 --> 01:23:48.252]  We're good.
[01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:12.275]  As we know from history, that's what led to World War I and the complete collapse of four great civilizations.
[01:24:12.275 --> 01:24:20.082]  The Russian Empire, the Turkish Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the German Empire, and to a large degree, even the British Empire.
[01:24:20.082 --> 01:24:25.827]  I was about to say, the British won World War I, which they started, but it was a Pyrrhic victory that later brought their empire down.
[01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:27.791]  Completely!
[01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:29.872]  And that's what you're seeing the same thing is.
[01:24:29.872 --> 01:24:31.213]  I mean, take the European Union.
[01:24:31.213 --> 01:24:38.999]  The European Union has gone from 30% of the world's GDP when it was just the Europe's much smaller version of the European Community Organization.
[01:24:38.999 --> 01:24:44.162]  Now it's almost less than 10% of GDP, world GDP, as it's much bigger and broader.
[01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:44.422]  Why?
[01:24:44.422 --> 01:24:46.424]  Because these bureaucrats are corrupt cowards.
[01:24:46.884 --> 01:24:49.046]  And they're incompetent, they're incapable.
[01:24:49.046 --> 01:24:56.370]  Even Kissinger has been warning about this in places like Ukraine and other places where he said we should be getting out rather than getting deeper in.
[01:24:56.370 --> 01:25:02.294]  And that's where we see, you know, we see Xi going to Putin and what it's shown is they have the same estimation of Putin.
[01:25:02.294 --> 01:25:10.159]  They thought Putin would be intimidated, that Putin would be threatened, that Putin was kind of a coward and he would capitulate if they escalated economic sanctions.
[01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:14.942]  Now they've issued a bogus international criminal court warrant again for his arrest.
[01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:18.004]  I mean, this is at the same time they're going after Trump.
[01:25:18.004 --> 01:25:19.986]  But Putin doesn't respond that way.
[01:25:19.986 --> 01:25:23.548]  It's like, whatever people think of Putin, he's not a coward.
[01:25:23.548 --> 01:25:26.331]  So the idea that he would react this way is dumb.
[01:25:26.331 --> 01:25:27.952]  And so this is bad politics.
[01:25:27.952 --> 01:25:29.433]  This is dumb politics.
[01:25:29.433 --> 01:25:44.865]  And what we're seeing is a dangerous politics, because when you're over open political weaponization of the legal system, like they did in trying to go after you in ways that expose the legal system, not you, now they're doing with Trump, which is exposing the criminal justice system, not Trump.
[01:25:45.365 --> 01:25:47.986]  Everybody knows this is a political prosecution.
[01:25:47.986 --> 01:25:51.108]  There's nobody who thinks this is a sincere, justified case.
[01:25:51.108 --> 01:25:56.491]  Obama committed massive campaign finance violations, paid major fines.
[01:25:56.491 --> 01:25:58.312]  Nobody talked about putting him in prison.
[01:25:58.312 --> 01:26:09.457]  Hillary Clinton committed massive violations, including the Russiagate steel dossier, was a massive money laundering criminal conspiracy involving Mark Ellis and Perkins Co., the big Democratic law firms at the time.
[01:26:09.457 --> 01:26:10.838]  And yet, did she go to jail?
[01:26:10.838 --> 01:26:13.259]  No, she just paid a few fines to the FEC.
[01:26:13.259 --> 01:26:14.400]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:18.963]  Let's expand on that and tie into what you just said.
[01:26:18.963 --> 01:26:20.644]  Take SVB.
[01:26:20.644 --> 01:26:29.671]  Now the New York Times and Washington Post are blaming right-wing groups who did not support the bank's transgenderism and critical race theory and 74 million of Black Lives Matter.
[01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:34.955]  They're now claiming that's why it went under, though regulators are even having to admit now they weren't even keeping ballot sheets.
[01:26:34.955 --> 01:26:39.038]  They were running it like drunken sailors, which goes back to the incompetence.
[01:26:39.038 --> 01:26:44.603]  They literally use wokeism as the cover for everything they do for their incompetence, but it's them destroying themselves.
[01:26:46.321 --> 01:26:46.721]  Absolutely.
[01:26:46.721 --> 01:26:54.764]  I mean, you see in Hollywood, you know, the reason why you have such bad writing is because they use wokeism to disguise the fact that they're just bad writers or bad storytellers.
[01:26:54.764 --> 01:27:08.790]  And the bigger story with the banks that we can probably get into a little more detail, but what may be happening behind the scenes is a combination of an attempt to take out the alternative crypto economy from central bank digital controlled central bank digital currency where they want to go.
[01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:15.753]  And part of the predicate to the success of a central bank digital currency is taking out the crypto alternatives to it.
[01:27:16.133 --> 01:27:22.518]  Which was SVB and was Signature, so the Deep State takes out their own banks to stop crypto and then blames us.
[01:27:23.974 --> 01:27:24.474]  Exactly.
[01:27:24.474 --> 01:27:27.977]  And I think the second stage is they want to consolidate banking power.
[01:27:27.977 --> 01:27:32.880]  You know, banks, we went from, I mean, we'll remember growing up, there were, you know, 5,000 plus banks in the United States.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.681]  There are all kinds of institutions.
[01:27:34.681 --> 01:27:35.422]  Now there's like 1,500.
[01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:38.283]  They want to shrink that even more.
[01:27:38.283 --> 01:27:39.804]  What they want to do is to the J.P.
[01:27:39.804 --> 01:27:49.791]  Morgan, because the whole key to the financial liquidity crisis, even what happened with Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, these other banks, is because big banks wouldn't lend to them.
[01:27:50.331 --> 01:28:14.553]  Even they could the big banks could have easily taken care of it flip their treasuries around for some cash for liquidity They wouldn't instead they're having to go to the small regional banks are having to go to the Federal Reserve window And so the reason that all of this is maybe happening is big banks are trying to take over all of the financial economy in order to set up the stage for a central bank digital currency and they're using the liquidity problems to
[01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:16.794]  And they're doing it to prop themselves up.
[01:28:16.794 --> 01:28:21.076]  I said that Friday when it started a week and a half ago, and I got criticism.
[01:28:21.076 --> 01:28:22.057]  Now Janet Yellen
[01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:39.001]  Last Friday says no, it's true to Congress.
[01:28:39.001 --> 01:28:41.064]  So it's all very transparent.
[01:28:41.064 --> 01:28:43.106]  How do you see this going when we come back?
[01:28:43.106 --> 01:28:54.098]  More on Ukraine, more on the banks, more on the weaponization hearings of the deep state against the American people and calls with Robert Barnes.
[01:28:54.098 --> 01:28:56.181]  I'm Alex Jones, Banned.Video.
[01:28:58.763 --> 01:29:02.165]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[01:29:02.165 --> 01:29:13.031]  The globalists are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others.
[01:29:13.031 --> 01:29:15.412]  So please, pray for us now more than ever.

[01:30:05.902 --> 01:30:09.905]  Dr. Jones Naturals Tumor Toothpaste that just came into stock.

[01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:21.914]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and does such great things for the body.
[01:30:21.914 --> 01:30:24.756]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[01:30:25.336 --> 01:30:26.557]  It is just dynamite.
[01:30:26.557 --> 01:30:31.142]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[01:30:31.142 --> 01:30:35.386]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at InFootworkStore.com.

[01:31:07.397 --> 01:31:08.217]  That's the good news.
[01:31:08.217 --> 01:31:09.358]  They're amazing.
[01:31:09.358 --> 01:31:17.564]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[01:31:17.564 --> 01:31:20.987]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWar.
[01:31:20.987 --> 01:31:25.911]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.

[01:31:55.956 --> 01:31:57.278]  InfoWarsTore.com

[01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:19.410]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:21.912]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[01:32:21.912 --> 01:32:32.079]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:36.983]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[01:32:36.983 --> 01:32:40.125]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[01:32:40.265 --> 01:32:44.789]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.539 --> 01:33:18.461]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:18.461 --> 01:33:21.062]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:26.064]  Alright, Robert Barnes is going to be co-hosting with me into the next hour.
[01:33:26.064 --> 01:33:28.185]  We'll start taking your phone calls next segment.
[01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:34.588]  We're going to cover Elon Musk and big developments there, the economy, the weaponization, hearings that were so bombshell the last few weeks.
[01:33:34.588 --> 01:33:35.508]  Incredible.
[01:33:35.508 --> 01:33:38.509]  Corporate media didn't cover it, but the internet was on fire with it.
[01:33:38.509 --> 01:33:41.831]  Hundreds of millions of views of those hearings and so much more.
[01:33:42.651 --> 01:33:47.954]  But Barnes, this philosophy of the globalist and the left, it caught off their nose despite their face.
[01:33:47.954 --> 01:33:49.795]  I know where it comes from at the top.
[01:33:49.795 --> 01:33:57.879]  When they control the central banks and can issue quadrillions in currency to themselves, they have a reckless attitude because they see themselves destroying economies.
[01:33:57.879 --> 01:33:59.700]  Consolidating power, they vertically integrate.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:05.465]  But at a certain point, they destroy the economy so much that there's real no assets for them to own.
[01:34:05.465 --> 01:34:12.012]  And if the public's aware that it's globalists doing it all, then their own supporters start to realize that it's a suicide pact.
[01:34:12.012 --> 01:34:14.174]  People ask why the left in Europe or the U.S.
[01:34:14.174 --> 01:34:17.417]  and any city they control run into the ground with the exact same policies.
[01:34:17.417 --> 01:34:24.584]  Well, they're auditioning to be a higher-level Deimos group person to show they're ready to destroy civilization and build a post-industrial world.
[01:34:24.944 --> 01:34:25.925]  Which is what the globalists do.
[01:34:25.925 --> 01:34:28.867]  They're so rich they think they'll be on their high-tech reservations.
[01:34:28.867 --> 01:34:36.354]  Above all the destruction they've created for us, they'll be in their District 12 while we're all off here in the Hunger Games hinterland.
[01:34:36.354 --> 01:34:38.556]  But that's not the way history works.
[01:34:38.556 --> 01:34:41.238]  It's always a two-way street, no matter how rigged it is.
[01:34:41.238 --> 01:34:45.382]  And I see so many examples of that in my own life, but I see it in their persecution of others.
[01:34:45.862 --> 01:34:48.607]  That really, at the end of the day, it's only making us stronger.
[01:34:48.607 --> 01:34:56.701]  As Nietzsche said, that which does not kill me only makes me stronger, as long as we aren't convinced by their wizardry to give up ourselves.
[01:34:58.208 --> 01:34:58.789]  Well, exactly.
[01:34:58.789 --> 01:35:00.790]  We can look at either history or look at literature.
[01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:04.974]  You look at history, you look at what's happening right now in France, mass protests.
[01:35:04.974 --> 01:35:12.941]  Macron is probably on his way out because he tried to do pension reform and he did pension reform in a way that circumvented the entire French Parliament.
[01:35:12.941 --> 01:35:13.221]  Why?
[01:35:13.221 --> 01:35:20.067]  Because Macron is probably auditioning for some globalist perk job that doesn't require him to answer to any of the plebs or the people.
[01:35:20.447 --> 01:35:30.731]  But what it's producing is a massive backlash in France that might finally align the populist left and populist right that has been so long divided in France that has allowed the establishment to maintain power.
[01:35:30.731 --> 01:35:33.912]  We already saw populist rebellions take place in Italy.
[01:35:33.912 --> 01:35:37.133]  Populist success continued unabated in Hungary and in Serbia.
[01:35:37.133 --> 01:35:48.978]  We're seeing populist rebellions likely going to take out the Schulz regime just as ultimately it took out the Tories in terms of Boris Johnson because of his Ukraine affectations and his pretend Churchill approach.
[01:35:49.358 --> 01:36:05.203]  What we see is a common, constant approach of elites at the end of a dying empire, so parochial, so provincial, so parasitic, that they see their own power, often at their own expense, and definitely at the expense of the constituents and communities they're supposed to serve.
[01:36:05.203 --> 01:36:09.885]  To use just one practical illustration, take what is happening in the Sandy Hook cases.
[01:36:10.345 --> 01:36:20.814]  Here, your ethical professional obligation as a lawyer is to maximize the economic benefit to your client, or whatever your client prioritizes as their interest.
[01:36:20.814 --> 01:36:29.341]  Here, in the bankruptcy proceedings, the Sandy Hook parents are being afforded an opportunity for, in my view, an extraordinary windfall.
[01:36:29.341 --> 01:36:33.225]  And yet, it's their own lawyers interfering in that process.
[01:36:33.225 --> 01:36:35.847]  It's their own lawyers preventing them from recovery.
[01:36:36.347 --> 01:36:50.622]  Because their own lawyers care more about censoring and silencing InfoWars and Alex Jones than they do performing their ethical professional duties to their own clients to maximize potential recovery for those clients.
[01:36:50.622 --> 01:36:58.850]  They're the ones sandbagging and sabotaging potential settlements out of the bankruptcy court from what is now public news and public information
[01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:02.092]  Based on the statements they made after the Connecticut trial.
[01:37:02.092 --> 01:37:05.015]  Based on the statements they made during the Texas trial.
[01:37:05.015 --> 01:37:09.999]  Which they said was about shutting up and silencing Infowars and Alex Jones.
[01:37:09.999 --> 01:37:12.260]  Not about economic recovery.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.123]  Which is their duty and obligation to the court and their clients.
[01:37:16.123 --> 01:37:19.826]  And what they said was supposed to be the case of the whole legal proceedings.
[01:37:19.826 --> 01:37:21.207]  They're committing legal malpractice.
[01:37:21.207 --> 01:37:25.491]  The Sandy Hook lawyers are setting themselves up to get sued by their own clients.
[01:37:25.891 --> 01:37:34.496]  The Sandy Hook parents' ultimate biggest recovery may come from the Sandy Hook plaintiffs' lawyers who are sabotaging their own opportunities at settlement.
[01:37:34.496 --> 01:37:35.136]  Extraordinary.
[01:37:35.136 --> 01:37:36.157]  But why does that happen?
[01:37:36.157 --> 01:37:38.658]  Why do you have lawyers betray their own clients?
[01:37:38.658 --> 01:37:44.922]  Why do you have elite governors and presidents and premiers and prime ministers betray their own communities and constituencies?
[01:37:45.342 --> 01:37:51.664]  Because they become obsessed with their own power, even at the ultimate expense of their long-term power.
[01:37:51.664 --> 01:37:54.444]  I mean, look at what... I mean, we blow up Nord Stream 2.
[01:37:54.444 --> 01:37:55.925]  That didn't really hurt Russia.
[01:37:55.925 --> 01:37:56.605]  Who did it hurt?
[01:37:56.605 --> 01:37:58.085]  It hurt the United States.
[01:37:58.085 --> 01:37:59.385]  And it hurt Germany.
[01:37:59.385 --> 01:38:03.946]  And Germany just goes along with it and pretends it didn't happen.
[01:38:03.946 --> 01:38:09.808]  Just as throughout Europe, they said, we're going to not let you Russians give us your natural oil and natural gas.
[01:38:09.808 --> 01:38:14.709]  Okay, your economy's going to shrink and you're going to be... Okay, we'll just sell it all to India that's now booming.
[01:38:16.192 --> 01:38:16.792]  Exactly!
[01:38:16.792 --> 01:38:19.834]  We'll cut a sweetheart deal with China so that Xi is happy.
[01:38:19.834 --> 01:38:28.579]  I mean, the Chiang and Russia have been adversaries for centuries, literally centuries, and now you have Xi and Putin smiling and hugging for the cameras.
[01:38:28.579 --> 01:38:40.086]  This is exactly what Trump set out to prevent, was he not only wanted to ally with Putin on issues of common cause... General Flynn had the master plan to cut off China with Obama, and Obama didn't follow the plan.
[01:38:40.086 --> 01:38:43.448]  Trump was about to play it, and of course now it's all been screwed up.
[01:38:44.088 --> 01:38:48.592]  Just one more thing on my own personal issue and in case.
[01:38:48.592 --> 01:38:51.255]  Remember, they asked for $2.7 trillion.
[01:38:51.255 --> 01:38:52.936]  I didn't have $3 million in the bank then.
[01:38:52.936 --> 01:38:55.018]  I don't have half a million dollars in the bank now.
[01:38:55.018 --> 01:38:56.600]  But the show's bigger and more successful than ever.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.821]  I never did this for money.
[01:38:57.821 --> 01:39:00.143]  I put 95% of the money over the years into the operation.
[01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:01.284]  Had a little bit of backup money.
[01:39:01.664 --> 01:39:05.946]  But they just keep pretending, like that New York Times article, I read it, nothing in it was true.
[01:39:05.946 --> 01:39:08.368]  We didn't offer them $44 million, totally made up.
[01:39:08.368 --> 01:39:10.749]  I don't have $270 million, totally made up.
[01:39:10.749 --> 01:39:15.932]  And they just put things in the paper that none of it's even true, and then the Connecticut lawyers get mad.
[01:39:15.932 --> 01:39:20.894]  I saw her in the news saying, oh, we're never going to settle and we're going to get the $1.5 billion.
[01:39:20.894 --> 01:39:22.335]  It doesn't exist.
[01:39:22.335 --> 01:39:25.176]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, so I don't, none of it even makes sense.
[01:39:25.176 --> 01:39:25.997]  It's like crazy.
[01:39:27.185 --> 01:39:32.747]  Well, I think that it's the lawyers lying to their own clients with the help of the New York Times.
[01:39:32.747 --> 01:39:50.693]  Because I think if you're one of these plaintiffs, and you have the chance for a windfall recovery, what I would call a windfall recovery, seven figures, you know, even if it's just a million, two million, whatever it is, on the lower end of the scale, but you have a real chance of real money, that for almost all people really matters.
[01:39:51.113 --> 01:40:04.924]  So if, but if you're the lawyers and you're the New York Times and what you're really doing is conspiring to silence Alex Jones and Infowars, then you, and that's how you're using this case for that purpose, not actually the case of recovery for these plaintiffs.
[01:40:04.924 --> 01:40:17.233]  And you use these plaintiffs merely as a tool, as a technique, as a tactic to try to achieve this political objective, this ethically impermissible objective, this professional malpractice objective.
[01:40:17.233 --> 01:40:19.695]  How do you convince the Sandy Hook plaintiffs
[01:40:19.995 --> 01:40:24.159]  To stay silent while they lose their chance at economic recovery.
[01:40:24.159 --> 01:40:28.904]  You convince them there's secretly hundreds of millions of dollars out there.
[01:40:28.904 --> 01:40:40.396]  And if we just wait, if we just take time, if we just keep marching and trying to completely destroy Infowars, magically that will lead to gold at the end of the rainbow and you'll actually make a lot more money.
[01:40:40.396 --> 01:40:42.158]  They are lying to their clients.
[01:40:42.558 --> 01:40:50.665]  And they're misleading their clients so their clients knowing that there's a real risk that their clients never get paid a penny.
[01:40:50.665 --> 01:40:57.772]  If they achieve what they're really out for, which is completely shutting down InfoWars, their clients never get paid.
[01:40:57.772 --> 01:40:59.914]  And that's what they have to hide from their clients.
[01:41:00.234 --> 01:41:04.778]  Because if they're honest with their clients, their clients are going to stop them from doing this.
[01:41:04.778 --> 01:41:06.560]  Their clients are going to sue them.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.662]  It's clear to me they're committing legal malpractice.
[01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:14.347]  It's clear the New York Times is in collusion with these corrupt road plaintiff's lawyers.
[01:41:14.347 --> 01:41:17.030]  I have no doubt that that is what is in fact taking place.
[01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:23.676]  And the people being screwed over are the people that they claimed were their victims if they were championing the Sandy Hook parents themselves.
[01:41:24.875 --> 01:41:29.584]  Well, we now know in hindsight that I was not removed off anything for Sandy Hook covers.
[01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:30.346]  It wasn't even the news.
[01:41:30.346 --> 01:41:33.552]  It was something I covered years before they sued me, barely covered it.
[01:41:33.552 --> 01:41:36.538]  A PR firm took it, blew it up, made it a huge national issue.
[01:41:37.421 --> 01:41:57.286]  Basically then exaggerated what I said and did to then get the parents basically harassed, make them mad, then they sue me and then they have judges find us in default because there was no evidence and the judges then tell the juries I'm guilty to then set this precedent to take not just myself off the air but Tucker Carlson and everybody else.
[01:41:57.286 --> 01:42:04.848]  They're now in the news article saying our goal was to take him off the air and then all other conservatives using this new system of lawfare
[01:42:05.268 --> 01:42:09.092]  They're admitting it in the newspaper that this was their goal.
[01:42:09.092 --> 01:42:16.199]  So I'm actually honored that there was this big of a deep state system that set all this up and did all this.
[01:42:16.199 --> 01:42:18.321]  But then I realized it wasn't just for Alex Jones.
[01:42:18.321 --> 01:42:19.222]  I was the first domino.
[01:42:20.914 --> 01:42:21.875]  Oh yeah, you're the template.
[01:42:21.875 --> 01:42:27.522]  Just like you're the template for social media censorship, you're the template for lawfare, and Donald Trump is the template.
[01:42:27.522 --> 01:42:38.014]  If they can come after the President of the United States, the future President of the United States, the leading presidential contestant to the existing President of the United States, then they can destroy any of us.
[01:42:38.414 --> 01:42:50.338]  That's what their goal is, to prove to the world that not only that they take out Trump, take out DeSantis in one clean sweep, but if they can take Trump out, they can take you out anytime they want, anywhere they want.
[01:42:50.338 --> 01:42:53.300]  That's why defending Trump is critical for all of our freedoms.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:53.600]  That's right.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.720]  This is the modern form of political assassination.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:56.561]  It's in the legal system.
[01:42:56.561 --> 01:42:57.041]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.959 --> 01:43:01.041]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:04.345]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:04.925]  You know why?
[01:43:04.925 --> 01:43:06.407]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[01:43:06.407 --> 01:43:10.031]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:10.031 --> 01:43:13.554]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:16.958]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[01:43:18.991 --> 01:43:22.015]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:43:22.015 --> 01:43:23.196]  This is reality.
[01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:25.018]  It's just pancakes.
[01:43:25.018 --> 01:43:27.581]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:43:27.581 --> 01:43:29.704]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:32.507]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[01:43:32.507 --> 01:43:33.609]  You're lying to the public.
[01:43:33.609 --> 01:43:34.770]  It's disgusting.
[01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:36.893]  The media continues to misrepresent.
[01:43:37.413 --> 01:43:38.174]  What I've said.
[01:43:38.174 --> 01:43:41.095]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:41.095 --> 01:43:45.077]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[01:43:45.077 --> 01:43:47.038]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[01:43:47.038 --> 01:43:49.159]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[01:43:49.159 --> 01:43:53.662]  We're gonna get fired up about the real things!
[01:43:53.662 --> 01:43:57.083]  The things that matter!
[01:43:57.083 --> 01:43:58.124]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[01:43:59.306 --> 01:44:03.229]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:44:29.246 --> 01:44:31.167]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[01:44:31.167 --> 01:44:31.748]  Stop!
[01:44:31.748 --> 01:44:32.708]  Stop!
[01:44:32.708 --> 01:44:35.110]  Stop!
[01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:37.211]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:37.211 --> 01:44:38.852]  They are nothing but distraction.
[01:44:38.852 --> 01:44:41.074]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:44:41.074 --> 01:44:43.535]  You silenced those voices.
[01:44:43.535 --> 01:44:47.298]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:44:47.298 --> 01:44:53.722]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[01:45:00.174 --> 01:45:03.316]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:45:03.316 --> 01:45:05.597]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:05.597 --> 01:45:09.540]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:17.625]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:17.625 --> 01:45:26.270]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:45:27.282 --> 01:45:30.926]  So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:30.926 --> 01:45:36.712]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:36.712 --> 01:45:39.755]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:45:39.755 --> 01:45:46.802]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:45:46.802 --> 01:45:48.004]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:48.864 --> 01:45:51.046]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:45:51.046 --> 01:45:55.030]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:58.754]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:46:11.966 --> 01:46:22.715]  That's why I asked listeners respectively to go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:46:22.715 --> 01:46:37.967]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:46:38.567 --> 01:46:42.610]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com, some of the very best products.
[01:46:42.610 --> 01:46:44.732]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[01:46:44.732 --> 01:46:50.076]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[01:46:50.076 --> 01:46:54.299]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[01:46:54.299 --> 01:46:55.801]  So again, please take action.
[01:46:55.801 --> 01:47:00.484]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[01:47:00.484 --> 01:47:06.369]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:23.473 --> 01:47:27.414]  All right, callers, we're going to be going to you this segment into the next hour.
[01:47:27.414 --> 01:47:28.814]  Robert Barnes rides shotgun with us.
[01:47:28.814 --> 01:47:32.375]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:32.375 --> 01:47:49.780]  One thing the New York Times got wrong, amongst almost everything else they got wrong in their big hit piece that's been put all over every newspaper I've seen and it's everywhere, including in the local statesman, is that we're booming here and that we've just rivers of money and rivers of gold and rivers of diamonds.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.560]  None of that's true.
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:48:01.086]  It's kind of apropos that Infowars is barely paying the bills, so they're wanting all this money that doesn't exist, but we don't want to be too good at that and have zero money.
[01:48:01.086 --> 01:48:05.309]  In fact, I'd like to have plenty of money to fight the appeals and move forward.
[01:48:05.309 --> 01:48:11.593]  There's been big rulings in Texas and federally, and almost every mainline analyst, including at the AP, says that they're
[01:48:12.293 --> 01:48:14.154]  Trials will be overturned.
[01:48:28.744 --> 01:48:30.126]  No, it's chapter 11, subchapter 5, which is a reorganization.
[01:48:30.126 --> 01:48:32.188]  So I want to just make that announcement to listeners again.
[01:48:45.905 --> 01:48:46.105]  This is
[01:49:04.706 --> 01:49:11.708]  So that any profits are put into a settlement trust in the future on the appeals that are three to four years and almost every expert agrees they will lose.
[01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:18.091]  I don't talk about us personally anymore but I get the questions all the time in text messages and on the street and you know the crew asking all the time.
[01:49:18.091 --> 01:49:19.591]  Any other points you want to add on that Barnes?
[01:49:19.591 --> 01:49:21.952]  We'll go to calls, start the next hour, get all the other news.
[01:49:24.459 --> 01:49:26.741]  The whole goal was to separate the audience.
[01:49:26.741 --> 01:49:32.103]  The same way that the Trump indictment is trying to separate Trump from his audience, from his base, from his supporters.
[01:49:32.103 --> 01:49:38.386]  The goal of the lawfare against Alex Jones at Infowars was all about stopping the audience from having its voice heard.
[01:49:38.826 --> 01:49:44.169]  Through Alex Jones, through InfoWars, through sharing the links, through continuing to support it.
[01:49:44.169 --> 01:49:48.471]  That's what they explicitly said in the Connecticut press conference right after the Connecticut verdict.
[01:49:48.471 --> 01:49:54.194]  They made an explicit and express call, please InfoWars supporters, stop supporting InfoWars.
[01:49:54.594 --> 01:50:13.609]  So if you want to continue to get back at protecting the First Amendment and continue to support independent populist information that was ahead of the curve on almost everything, whether it was global war, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was Epstein, whether it was any of these scandals, whether it was the Biden family, whether it was Biden's bad health.
[01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:14.690]  There was a reason people forget.
[01:50:14.690 --> 01:50:16.332]  That's why they kicked off of Instagram.
[01:50:16.332 --> 01:50:22.897]  You exposed Biden's first one to expose Biden's serious health problems, which now are a constant meme and source of comedy.
[01:50:23.257 --> 01:50:28.861]  The best way to do that is to continue to support InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:28.861 --> 01:50:31.302]  And I speak from personal lived experience.
[01:50:31.302 --> 01:50:33.624]  I've been a supporter for the better part of a decade.
[01:50:33.624 --> 01:50:37.706]  I continue to, mostly because it's great products at a great price.
[01:50:37.706 --> 01:50:44.951]  But I love supporting something that keeps free populist information on the air out to the American people.
[01:50:45.191 --> 01:50:47.432]  This is a perspective you don't get anywhere else.
[01:50:47.432 --> 01:50:55.096]  If you want to keep it, if you want to keep the First Amendment, if you want to keep this voice on the air, continue to support InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:55.096 --> 01:51:06.522]  Find something you like, that you need anyway, at an affordable, accessible price, and get back at the deep state, because this is still the best public tool against the deep state that exists.
[01:51:06.522 --> 01:51:09.163]  That's the reason why it was such a target for the last half decade.
[01:51:09.443 --> 01:51:22.509]  I want to go to calls, but I took my parents out to dinner last night, and when I was leaving, an older man came over and he said, listen, I'm a local bank executive, and he mentioned the bank's a pretty big Texas bank.
[01:51:23.319 --> 01:51:33.267]  And he said, I want to know how you knew a week and a half ago, this was a plan for the central bank digital currencies that they weren't going to extend lending to small and regional lending banks.
[01:51:33.267 --> 01:51:33.988]  How did you know that?
[01:51:33.988 --> 01:51:38.992]  Because he said, I saw the clips on Twitter and I wasn't sure if you were right.
[01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:40.873]  And then I saw Tucker the next week and I saw others.
[01:51:40.873 --> 01:51:41.414]  How did you know?
[01:51:41.414 --> 01:51:43.636]  And I just gave him like a one minute summation.
[01:51:43.636 --> 01:51:47.639]  And I said, it's the globalist policy to consolidate power, vertically integrate.
[01:51:47.639 --> 01:51:48.880]  He goes, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:49.680]  And I said, and they want to.
[01:51:50.521 --> 01:52:03.184]  Prepare the way to consolidate power to prop themselves up as a form of quantitative easing to use new liquidity out of the Federal Reserve, but that's only given to the large mega banks, to continue that policy of consolidation.
[01:52:03.184 --> 01:52:07.605]  And I knew that they did not prop up SVB when they could have done it for a couple million dollars.
[01:52:07.605 --> 01:52:09.225]  So they let the contagion grow.
[01:52:09.225 --> 01:52:12.025]  So knowing their past policies, it was easy to call what they did.
[01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:17.807]  He said, well, yeah, because I just saw two days ago Yellen on Friday admitted all this.
[01:52:17.807 --> 01:52:19.167]  I just want to know who are your sources?
[01:52:19.767 --> 01:52:22.529]  And I said, it's not sources, sir.
[01:52:22.529 --> 01:52:23.289]  I live this.
[01:52:23.289 --> 01:52:24.110]  I breathe this.
[01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:24.790]  I eat this.
[01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:25.951]  I sleep this.
[01:52:25.951 --> 01:52:28.032]  And that's why we're almost always right.
[01:52:28.032 --> 01:52:28.992]  It's not hard.
[01:52:28.992 --> 01:52:31.154]  Once you immerse yourself in the policy, you know it.
[01:52:31.154 --> 01:52:32.775]  It's why Barnes doesn't listen to me a lot.
[01:52:32.775 --> 01:52:33.775]  I listen to him some.
[01:52:33.775 --> 01:52:34.656]  He listens some.
[01:52:34.656 --> 01:52:37.417]  But he has basically the same views because he's historical.
[01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:38.018]  He's a lawyer.
[01:52:38.018 --> 01:52:39.358]  He's been around a while.
[01:52:39.358 --> 01:52:43.941]  Once you get the perspective of how it really works, it's the same process.
[01:52:43.941 --> 01:52:45.462]  It's the same organization.
[01:52:45.462 --> 01:52:48.063]  Just something that it's expanding.
[01:52:48.063 --> 01:52:48.504]  And so
[01:52:49.761 --> 01:52:55.364]  That's my main message is once people get how this works, then everything makes sense.
[01:52:55.364 --> 01:52:59.687]  If you don't know how politics really works and buy into the pop version of it, nothing ever makes sense.
[01:52:59.687 --> 01:53:01.007]  It's designed to confound you.
[01:53:01.007 --> 01:53:02.208]  It's a smokescreen.
[01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.689]  But what we are is like radar.
[01:53:03.689 --> 01:53:06.390]  You can have all the smoke you want, but radar sees right through it.
[01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:10.193]  And that's really why InfoWars is so valuable is we really get their plan.
[01:53:11.013 --> 01:53:11.433]  I don't know.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.243]  Notice the whole world, they say, is like Alex Jones now.
[01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:38.685]  Oh, Russell Brand's Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.685 --> 01:53:40.387]  Joe Rogan's Alex Jones.
[01:53:40.387 --> 01:53:41.588]  Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones.
[01:53:41.588 --> 01:53:43.430]  All these other people are Alex Jones now.
[01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:44.331]  Jimmy Dore's Alex Jones.
[01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:45.533]  No, they're not Alex Jones!
[01:53:45.533 --> 01:53:52.621]  They've taken the blinders off, they've switched the radar on, so no matter how much smokescreen there is, we can now see what the enemy's doing.
[01:53:54.306 --> 01:53:54.927]  Precisely.
[01:53:54.927 --> 01:54:00.351]  And being accurate over and over and over again at key and critical junctures has proven that.
[01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:09.738]  But it's also because, as you know, understanding the template, understanding what the pattern is, understanding what the methodologies are, understanding who the motives are, understanding what these participants are up to.
[01:54:09.738 --> 01:54:10.598]  And that's critical.
[01:54:10.598 --> 01:54:12.580]  And the audience has been leading that.
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:23.108]  It was not a coincidence that the leader leading protests against the lockdowns, leading protests against mask mandates, leading protests against the vaccines and its dangers and inefficiencies.
[01:54:23.408 --> 01:54:35.055]  We're waiting on a federal judge to make a ruling on that motion to dismiss that we held that InfoWars audience got an exclusive of right after the hearing when I was on as to that case and its critical essential nature.
[01:54:35.055 --> 01:54:50.904]  So all of those issues were issues the InfoWars audience was ahead of the curve on because they spend the time to study and understand what the issues are politically, what the template is, what the path is, and they understand the world and can foresee the world and can predict the world
[01:54:51.244 --> 01:54:57.852]  A lot better than the deep state types that are still making the fundamental mistake of believing the world looks like them.
[01:54:57.852 --> 01:55:00.935]  They think the world is all criminals.
[01:55:00.935 --> 01:55:05.240]  I know I was under investigation seven years ago and again five years ago by the FBI.
[01:55:07.222 --> 01:55:09.603]  You know, counter espionage groups and others.
[01:55:09.603 --> 01:55:14.424]  And I later had a chance to talk to and run into and meet with a few of these people.
[01:55:14.424 --> 01:55:17.925]  And they said, no, no, we know you have no foreign connections and no one advising you.
[01:55:17.925 --> 01:55:23.006]  We were just ordered to because no one believed you knew all this without some type of state sponsoring.
[01:55:23.006 --> 01:55:26.667]  And when I explain to these people is, you know, the states listen to us.
[01:55:26.667 --> 01:55:28.127]  And I want to be clear, it's not Alex Jones.
[01:55:28.127 --> 01:55:29.208]  It's my guest.
[01:55:29.208 --> 01:55:30.068]  It's the callers.
[01:55:30.068 --> 01:55:31.528]  It's the it's the journalist.
[01:55:31.528 --> 01:55:34.529]  It's this consortium of all we do is study this.
[01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:41.013]  Show anybody that studied this 15 hours a day, who doesn't have, you know, brain damage, is going to figure it out.
[01:55:41.013 --> 01:55:46.797]  And the globalists are scared that as soon as their own people figure this out, most of them are compartmentalized, it's game over.
[01:55:46.797 --> 01:55:55.983]  Because this confusion is key for the system to maintain control of its own people, who, with this knowledge, could easily overtake the system themselves.
[01:55:57.928 --> 01:55:58.828]  Completely.
[01:55:58.828 --> 01:56:03.010]  It's what's in common between people like Trump, Orban, and Putin.
[01:56:03.010 --> 01:56:03.230]  Right?
[01:56:03.230 --> 01:56:09.913]  Like, whatever people think of either Trump, Orban, or Putin, what they all have in common is that they've seen through globalist lies.
[01:56:09.913 --> 01:56:12.834]  And they know that they can take on globalists and win and succeed.
[01:56:13.434 --> 01:56:21.641]  And what the globalists have done is convince themselves that these people are like themselves, that they're cowards, that they're corrupt, that they're incapable.
[01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:29.767]  And the reality is that confession through projection is their biggest venal crime, because what it does is it subjects them to failure over and over again.
[01:56:29.767 --> 01:56:33.930]  We just have to make sure we're not part of the collateral damage when they blow things up.
[01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:50.997]  When they blow up the banking system with the global liquidity problems we're witnessing around the world, when they're trying to trigger World War III in Ukraine repeatedly and over and over again, when they're trying to so overtly and openly politically weaponize our legal system to where people no longer have confidence or faith in it,
[01:56:51.457 --> 01:57:07.961]  When they do these things that could have the collateral damage of exploding the whole system, we have to make sure we're not the collateral damage, and instead are in a position to take advantage of those situations to do what our founding fathers did, which was use it as an opportunity to restore faith and trust.
[01:57:07.961 --> 01:57:08.742]  That's right!
[01:57:08.742 --> 01:57:14.043]  Our job is not running around setting bombs, it's disarming bombs.
[01:57:15.729 --> 01:57:16.269]  Exactly.
[01:57:16.269 --> 01:57:17.530]  That's exactly right.
[01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:21.012]  And there's nobody that does that better than the InfoWars audience.
[01:57:21.012 --> 01:57:32.019]  And they do it better by continuing to support InfoWars, keeping it on the air despite all the assaults and attacks, all the lies and all the libels, by going to InfoWarsStore.com and finding things they support.
[01:57:32.019 --> 01:57:33.219]  So credit to the audience.
[01:57:33.219 --> 01:57:33.840]  Shout out to the audience.
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:34.320]  Absolutely.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.561]  And speaking of them, I know they've been holding, and I apologize.
[01:57:36.561 --> 01:57:38.362]  We're going to talk to Robert Barnes in two minutes.
[01:57:38.362 --> 01:57:40.784]  We're coming right back with Patrick and others straight ahead.
[01:57:40.784 --> 01:57:42.665]  Back in two minutes with Robert Barnes.
[01:57:42.665 --> 01:57:44.126]  I'm going to twist his arm, get him to stay longer.
[01:57:48.712 --> 01:57:52.116]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[01:57:52.116 --> 01:57:53.879]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[01:57:53.879 --> 01:58:02.990]  But they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down info wars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson and countless others.
[01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:04.792]  So please, pray for us now more than ever.

[01:59:51.993 --> 01:59:55.936]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:02.943 --> 02:00:06.305]  All right, folks, into hour number three with Robert Barnes.
[02:00:06.305 --> 02:00:07.846]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.846 --> 02:00:09.507]  Patrick in Massachusetts, thanks for holding.
[02:00:09.507 --> 02:00:10.968]  You're on the air.
[02:00:10.968 --> 02:00:18.892]  You've got your comments on Trump and protest that Maxine Waters is calling terrorist if you protest tyranny.
[02:00:18.892 --> 02:00:20.593]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:00:20.593 --> 02:00:25.856]  Yes, Patrick Vincent Deitner, former candidate for state rep for Mass.
[02:00:25.856 --> 02:00:30.139]  You know, it's obvious what's going on here is the January 6th narrative is blowing up in their face.
[02:00:30.802 --> 02:00:34.085]  And they're trying to manufacture another event like that.
[02:00:34.085 --> 02:00:35.546]  But I do think it's interesting.
[02:00:35.546 --> 02:00:39.910]  There's a little criticism about how Trump worded his call for protest.
[02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:53.842]  And I do understand that criticism, but, you know, it puts MAGA in a really interesting position to now not take the bait and thus prove that Trump doesn't have some sort of cult-like control over his supporters.
[02:00:53.842 --> 02:00:55.544]  We can think for ourselves.
[02:00:55.544 --> 02:00:58.026]  We can assess the situation, organize peacefully.
[02:00:58.909 --> 02:01:04.938]  And, you know, if people do feel compelled to protest, I would argue maybe go to your local church and organize a prayer rally.
[02:01:04.938 --> 02:01:05.679]  Something like that.
[02:01:05.679 --> 02:01:07.341]  Leave the picket signs at home.
[02:01:07.341 --> 02:01:09.404]  Power of prayer will work just as well as some...
[02:01:09.946 --> 02:01:11.507]  You know, clever words on a sign.
[02:01:11.507 --> 02:01:33.998]  And let me add this, then put your peaceful rally, whether it's in a courthouse or a capitol or a church or wherever it is, or a party at your house with friends, praying for due process, praying for justice, praying to save our republic, shoot it live, stream it live, and millions of people protesting peacefully, all digitally magnifying it, will reach hundreds of millions of people.
[02:01:33.998 --> 02:01:37.540]  So many activists think, I'm going to go protest but not put it out digitally.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.000]  No.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.501]  That's the most important part, Barnes.
[02:01:41.010 --> 02:01:41.551]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:01:41.551 --> 02:01:42.191]  Exactly.
[02:01:42.191 --> 02:01:57.647]  The way the model is, the model the InfoWars audience used against the lockdowns, which was a combination of in-person protest at the right locations, avoid certain democratic areas, democratic states, counties, and cities, do it in other places and other locations generally,
[02:01:58.487 --> 02:02:01.850]  So that's step one to avoid a January 6th entrapment plot.
[02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:05.053]  But secondly, the critical point, as you note, could be very loud.
[02:02:05.053 --> 02:02:07.295]  There's many ways to protest today.
[02:02:07.295 --> 02:02:13.500]  And you can protest digitally, you can protest physically, but as you note, record it and broadcast it everywhere.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:19.245]  You know, Owen Schroyer's little Ukraine thing this weekend, you know, went viral in a bunch of different places.
[02:02:19.245 --> 02:02:23.088]  People should not underrate or underestimate their ability to make a difference.
[02:02:23.568 --> 02:02:35.973]  There's a reason the FBI was spending time on small Twitter accounts because small Twitter accounts can have a big impact because they're connected to local people that have real roots and authenticity in organic protest.
[02:02:35.973 --> 02:02:37.954]  So there's lots of ways to protest.
[02:02:37.954 --> 02:02:39.635]  People should definitely protest.
[02:02:39.635 --> 02:02:41.815]  Just protest smart and peaceful.
[02:02:41.815 --> 02:02:44.617]  Use the Lockdown InfoWars model to do so.
[02:02:44.617 --> 02:02:48.958]  And that is a combination of physical protest in the right location and digitally.
[02:02:48.958 --> 02:02:50.519]  Be very active in the social media.
[02:02:50.519 --> 02:02:50.799]  That's right.
[02:02:50.799 --> 02:02:51.319]  Let's be clear.
[02:02:51.319 --> 02:02:52.720]  You go protest in New York.
[02:02:53.180 --> 02:03:00.243]  The Democrats have crazy antifa willing to wrestle up like a Trump supporter and throw a firebomb at police and then say you're part of it because you're there.
[02:03:00.243 --> 02:03:04.245]  Still shouldn't be intimidated to go out, just be aware, be taping everything.
[02:03:04.245 --> 02:03:08.747]  But exactly, we bought the armored vehicle four years ago for $300,000.
[02:03:08.747 --> 02:03:10.208]  It paid for itself the first few trips.
[02:03:10.208 --> 02:03:19.412]  We go to any Trump rally, get all the news attention, then put our key stories out against the New World Order, hijacking the whole Trump narrative and making him more anti-New World Order, more radical.
[02:03:19.412 --> 02:03:21.413]  And yeah, the left attacks us, so we have an armored vehicle.
[02:03:21.813 --> 02:03:32.002]  We may only just get love, but we go to any event, we take over the narrative, whether it's a Beto event, whatever it is, with the armored vehicle, with the loudspeakers, it's a very simple, effective thing to do.
[02:03:32.002 --> 02:03:36.827]  And I think county Republican Party groups should get an armored vehicle and use it.
[02:03:36.827 --> 02:03:43.653]  You take over any event peacefully, you're safe inside of it, and it's what we need to do.
[02:03:46.494 --> 02:03:49.857]  Oh exactly, and people should not underestimate their own voice.
[02:03:49.857 --> 02:03:54.240]  I often say the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he did not exist.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:58.244]  The greatest trick the system ever pulled is convincing you that you cannot resist.
[02:03:58.244 --> 02:04:12.255]  So people should not overreact to January 6th's entrapment by saying, oh now I should be silent, now I should be mute, now I shouldn't say anything in social media, now I shouldn't go to InfoWarsTore.com, now I shouldn't support InfoWars, now I shouldn't go out in public and protest.
[02:04:12.595 --> 02:04:13.576]  That would be a mistake.
[02:04:13.576 --> 02:04:16.077]  That would be a misread and misinterpretation.
[02:04:16.077 --> 02:04:22.282]  Avoid the evidence of entrapment locations and places, but that does not mean you cannot protest physically.
[02:04:22.282 --> 02:04:26.144]  That does not mean you cannot protest in the digital social media space.
[02:04:26.144 --> 02:04:32.709]  That doesn't mean you can find other ways of effective protest by supporting the networks that support you and support your message.
[02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:34.750]  Remember, it worked against lockdowns.
[02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:36.171]  It worked against mask mandates.
[02:04:36.491 --> 02:04:40.333]  It has ultimately worked in many ways at limiting how many people took the vaccine.
[02:04:40.333 --> 02:04:47.857]  A bunch of people didn't give their kid the vaccine because ordinary people in this InfoWars audience shared enough information links that prevented them from doing it.
[02:04:47.857 --> 02:04:50.018]  So don't underestimate your own voice.
[02:04:50.018 --> 02:04:51.779]  That's right, and use it or be a slave.
[02:04:51.779 --> 02:04:53.500]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with more phone calls.
[02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:54.480]  Baldy, you're up next.
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.443]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.443 --> 02:05:04.786]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.384]  Dr. Jones Natural's Turmeric Toothpaste that just came into stock.
[02:05:10.384 --> 02:05:13.666]  And I gotta tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[02:05:13.666 --> 02:05:17.610]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth, is insane.
[02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:22.374]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and does such great things for the body.
[02:05:22.374 --> 02:05:25.237]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[02:05:25.817 --> 02:05:27.018]  It is just dynamite.
[02:05:27.018 --> 02:05:31.602]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[02:05:31.602 --> 02:05:35.845]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at InfoWorksTour.com.
[02:05:35.845 --> 02:05:38.567]  Dr. Jones Naturals Turmeric Toothpaste.
[02:05:38.567 --> 02:05:41.830]  And while you're at it, check out the new Ashwagandha line of products.
[02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:46.674]  We have Ashwagandha with black pepper extract for your libido, your testosterone, in pill form.
[02:05:46.914 --> 02:05:52.656]  And we have the Pure Ashwagandha Root Gummies as well, now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:52.656 --> 02:05:55.177]  They're amazing products, and they fund the Info War.
[02:05:55.177 --> 02:06:00.118]  Take action now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:06:00.118 --> 02:06:03.319]  Frontlines of the Information War.
[02:06:03.319 --> 02:06:04.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.655 --> 02:06:11.977]  All right, into hour number three, taking your phone calls with Robert Barnes.
[02:06:11.977 --> 02:06:17.640]  But I want to just briefly hit on something he just said before the last segment ended.
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:26.024]  It is not myself that gets the credit, but you need to understand the credit you get, audience, so you realize how much power you have, so that you realize you should do more of what you did.
[02:06:26.024 --> 02:06:28.766]  I know that's a very simple statement, but it's profound and true.
[02:06:29.997 --> 02:06:38.080]  This operation was the first to bring on expert guess and analysis that it was made in a lab and to predict what the shot would do with top scientists.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:41.821]  We breached the wall because we were already censored off social media.
[02:06:41.821 --> 02:06:43.822]  Everybody else was scared to do it.
[02:06:43.822 --> 02:06:44.482]  We weren't.
[02:06:44.482 --> 02:06:53.605]  Barnes was right there with us as well with other great researchers and lawyers like Dr. Francis Boyle.
[02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:55.826]  We hit the barbed wire as the shock trips of truth.
[02:06:55.826 --> 02:06:58.907]  We've been totally vindicated and
[02:06:59.893 --> 02:07:04.675]  You listened to us, you did your own research, and you did protests all over the country three years ago.
[02:07:04.675 --> 02:07:08.817]  They were going to keep the lockdowns going indefinitely.
[02:07:08.817 --> 02:07:14.520]  They admit, and I learned this from another prominent lawyer, it's going to be coming out soon, they're going to be filing a lawsuit over it.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:16.781]  Not on my behalf, but for whistleblowers.
[02:07:16.781 --> 02:07:25.205]  A whistleblower from one of the largest, most powerful, A-tier, A-plus tier,
[02:07:26.374 --> 02:07:35.257]  And I was asked not to say the name, but when I say the most powerful, there's only three big global foundations that are the most powerful.
[02:07:35.257 --> 02:07:36.717]  Okay?
[02:07:36.717 --> 02:07:39.898]  One of them runs the CIA today publicly.
[02:07:39.898 --> 02:07:45.480]  But they have the documents from three years ago, two years ago, and six months ago.
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:49.581]  And I'm so honored by this, even though it is scary.
[02:07:49.581 --> 02:07:55.163]  But I came looking, you know, to take these folks on, so you gotta, when God gives you your, answer your prayers, better be ready for them.
[02:07:56.141 --> 02:08:11.292]  But this major foundation is most concerned about InfoWars and how we take control of the narratives and they've tracked back to this show literally stopping 90% of what they're doing and triggering everybody else to the chain reaction.
[02:08:11.292 --> 02:08:16.135]  So when I say that, folks, it's not Alex Jones that's saying we're the most effective.
[02:08:16.135 --> 02:08:23.981]  It's one of the three largest, most powerful foundations in the world that basically created the New World Order.
[02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:31.033]  I'm going a little too far there, I promise I wouldn't say who, but that's a pretty obvious guess.
[02:08:31.033 --> 02:08:35.036]  Created, physically, where the New World Order is.
[02:08:35.036 --> 02:08:36.217]  Okay, now I'm giving it away.
[02:08:36.217 --> 02:08:41.180]  The point is, most people are like, well, that's really frightening, but I mean, I asked for it.
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:49.306]  It's actually very exciting that literally very soon, this is going to be coming out, because the folks that told me this have brought forward some of the biggest whistleblowers.
[02:08:51.124 --> 02:08:52.385]  Well, I mean, they kind of gave it away.
[02:08:52.385 --> 02:08:56.008]  There was a lawyer on the air a few weeks ago, and he said, hey, a big group's after you.
[02:08:56.008 --> 02:08:58.591]  And off air, I asked who, and he gave me the details.
[02:08:58.591 --> 02:09:02.134]  But the point is, that's when you know you've got real success.
[02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:03.775]  You're over the target barns.
[02:09:03.775 --> 02:09:11.202]  To have one of the big three foundations, and it's Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:09:11.202 --> 02:09:14.024]  But really, the most powerful is Carnegie and Rockefeller, and below that's Gates.
[02:09:14.024 --> 02:09:15.966]  It's really a subgroup of those two.
[02:09:15.966 --> 02:09:17.828]  To have one of those top three,
[02:09:19.787 --> 02:09:24.911]  Say that I'm the number one enemy, or this show is, is, I think, the greatest reward of my life so far.
[02:09:24.911 --> 02:09:27.153]  What do you think of that?
[02:09:27.153 --> 02:09:28.333]  Oh, I think, no doubt.
[02:09:28.333 --> 02:09:29.795]  And it's a credit to the audience.
[02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:32.396]  Their audience is continuing support of InfoWars.
[02:09:32.396 --> 02:09:35.379]  The audience continuing embrace and sharing of the message.
[02:09:35.379 --> 02:09:36.660]  They're doing their own research.
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:46.507]  This is why the FBI, as has now been publicly confirmed by the Twitter files released, was following Twitter accounts with as little as 50 followers, that like 500 people would read the tweet.
[02:09:46.967 --> 02:09:47.308]  Why?
[02:09:47.308 --> 02:10:00.123]  Because they were trying to track the original source of a range of information that took over large parts of the public narrative that changed the position of key decision makers even because of it.
[02:10:00.123 --> 02:10:03.648]  They're like, how did we fail where we previously succeeded?
[02:10:04.068 --> 02:10:05.008]  And they're trying to figure that out.
[02:10:05.008 --> 02:10:07.709]  The pandemic's supposed to lead to long-term lockdowns.
[02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:14.631]  Pandemic's supposed to lead to central bank digital currencies and modern monetary theory on a quick and consistent basis.
[02:10:14.631 --> 02:10:18.312]  It was supposed to lead to the destruction of their political opposition.
[02:10:18.312 --> 02:10:22.153]  It was supposed to do a bunch of things that it didn't achieve, that in fact backfired.
[02:10:22.153 --> 02:10:23.633]  Vaccine strategy backfired.
[02:10:23.633 --> 02:10:28.214]  More than 90% of parents are not vaccinating using COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:10:28.214 --> 02:10:30.615]  Well, that's exactly what the foundation document said is.
[02:10:31.195 --> 02:10:32.296]  They lead it back here.
[02:10:32.296 --> 02:10:37.458]  So it's not me, it's the audience, it's the guests, but this is the main breach point in their operation, folks.
[02:10:37.458 --> 02:10:41.940]  This is the place to continue to support because literally the enemy recognizes that.
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:45.722]  And I think we all have to recognize that a prophet's not known in his own land.
[02:10:45.722 --> 02:10:47.202]  I'm not saying I'm the prophet.
[02:10:47.202 --> 02:10:51.144]  I'm saying this operation is seen by the enemy as their number one enemy.
[02:10:51.144 --> 02:10:52.845]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:10:52.845 --> 02:10:54.545]  Valdi in Florida, you're on the air with Robert Barnes.
[02:10:54.545 --> 02:10:56.706]  Thank you for the beautiful segue.
[02:10:58.675 --> 02:11:02.118]  So, first, I just want to address one thing quick.
[02:11:02.118 --> 02:11:12.747]  Dr. Francis Boyle sat behind Kissinger's desk at Harvard and was groomed, but just like the Santas, that does not disqualify him from being a patriot.
[02:11:12.747 --> 02:11:16.871]  We need to judge people, what they do on the field and what they do in the arena.
[02:11:16.871 --> 02:11:23.557]  When I first started listening to you, I heard you on Coast to Coast, and I would click onto the site and click off real fast because I was scared.
[02:11:23.557 --> 02:11:24.657]  But then I figured, you know what?
[02:11:24.657 --> 02:11:26.259]  I'm already on that list.
[02:11:27.025 --> 02:11:32.049]  So why not get to the top, top, tip top of the list, and that's what I've been doing ever since.
[02:11:32.049 --> 02:11:33.630]  Thank you for the motivation.
[02:11:33.630 --> 02:11:48.842]  My whole life, you know, I know it's been a scam, a crooked game, but you really, you're even a John the Baptist of Patriots because you've baptized more Patriots in this battle against the New World Order than anybody.
[02:11:48.842 --> 02:11:50.744]  Two quick solutions.
[02:11:50.744 --> 02:11:56.068]  One, if anyone listening to this has money or knows anyone that has money, one of the
[02:11:56.892 --> 02:12:00.816]  I don't mean to interrupt you, but that's a great idea.
[02:12:00.816 --> 02:12:04.359]  What if we have a run on big, big banks and put it in little banks, Barnes?
[02:12:15.194 --> 02:12:17.596]  Well, I think it's also another mechanism of protest.
[02:12:17.596 --> 02:12:19.758]  I mean, look at how the French protest.
[02:12:19.758 --> 02:12:29.867]  So if people both want to have more stable, reliable savings, it's always advisable not to have too much money in any Fed bank, period.
[02:12:29.867 --> 02:12:33.590]  Definitely not any of the big connected Fed banks to the Federal Reserve.
[02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:36.373]  That's just politically wise in any circumstance.
[02:12:37.013 --> 02:12:44.819]  And it's always good to have some cash, some diamonds, some things, whatever you can to have tangible, to have some land and farm and water access.
[02:12:44.819 --> 02:12:48.982]  There's a range of storable foods you can get at importstore.com.
[02:12:48.982 --> 02:12:55.127]  It's always smart to have that backup plan and available because you want the plan and not need it rather than need the plan and not have it.
[02:12:55.447 --> 02:12:57.510]  So that's always sound and sage.
[02:12:57.510 --> 02:13:01.955]  And as to the callers' notice about DeSantis, that's what the Deep State concluded.
[02:13:01.955 --> 02:13:11.546]  They concluded he was not a reliable ally after he went AWOL against the World Economic Forum during the pandemic and, you know, came out ultimately even against the vaccine.
[02:13:11.546 --> 02:13:14.149]  And that's why they're trying to trick him into running against Trump.
[02:13:14.389 --> 02:13:17.210]  No, I totally agree with what Baldy said and what you just said.
[02:13:17.210 --> 02:13:19.290]  We don't judge people about where they came from.
[02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:27.332]  Saul of Tarsus was the number one persecutor for the Sanhedrin against Christians, and he literally became the Christians' greatest defender.
[02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:33.034]  And so, sometimes, in fact, a lot of the time, God takes evil people who are not totally turned over.
[02:13:33.034 --> 02:13:35.434]  It's like Darth Vader at the end kills Palpatine.
[02:13:35.434 --> 02:13:39.735]  And we have to, when somebody goes our way, whether it's Musk or anybody, we've got to give them a chance.
[02:13:39.735 --> 02:13:41.195]  Thank you, Baldy, great points.
[02:13:41.195 --> 02:13:43.296]  Let's go to Trucking Tim in Iowa.
[02:13:43.496 --> 02:13:44.436]  Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:13:44.436 --> 02:13:45.897]  Go ahead.
[02:13:45.897 --> 02:13:46.637]  Hey, Alex.
[02:13:46.637 --> 02:13:47.437]  Love you, brother.
[02:13:47.437 --> 02:13:48.597]  Love all the crew.
[02:13:48.597 --> 02:13:50.118]  Love all the audience.
[02:13:50.118 --> 02:13:51.998]  Two points.
[02:13:51.998 --> 02:13:55.159]  One, you're on the fence about the products.
[02:13:55.159 --> 02:14:03.181]  You're only doing yourself a disservice, because it'll turn your life 180 degrees around, and you'll never look back.
[02:14:03.181 --> 02:14:08.283]  Two, you were talking about smoke screens.
[02:14:08.283 --> 02:14:11.424]  This whole Trump thing, what are they really doing?
[02:14:13.206 --> 02:14:15.067]  We're being distracted from Ms.
[02:14:15.067 --> 02:14:17.248]  Trump.
[02:14:17.248 --> 02:14:20.289]  And one more thing, if I could.
[02:14:20.289 --> 02:14:29.854]  I found somebody that made quite a great point about the 15-minute cities and all the people that, you know, build the cities and keep them running, which is us.
[02:14:29.854 --> 02:14:38.758]  We all band together and refuse to build them, refuse to... and call out all the companies supporting them and everything else.
[02:14:38.758 --> 02:14:40.759]  They ain't got a leg to stand on with these cities.
[02:14:41.801 --> 02:14:49.824]  I totally agree, and people are protesting by the hundreds of thousands in the UK and Europe against him, and in Canada.
[02:14:49.824 --> 02:14:51.504]  I don't know why we're not seeing more protests here.
[02:14:51.504 --> 02:14:51.924]  Great point.
[02:14:51.924 --> 02:14:53.205]  Anything else, Trucker?
[02:14:53.205 --> 02:15:00.867]  There's a guy that started a website, it's not up yet, but it's called Blue Collar Boycott, that will do just that.
[02:15:00.867 --> 02:15:03.728]  Call out companies supporting cities, call out the people.
[02:15:04.392 --> 02:15:06.915]  And basically tell them to go screw themselves.
[02:15:06.915 --> 02:15:08.196]  We're not built in your city.
[02:15:08.196 --> 02:15:08.637]  Exactly.
[02:15:08.637 --> 02:15:10.979]  We should not participate in these anti-human cities.
[02:15:10.979 --> 02:15:11.860]  Great point.
[02:15:11.860 --> 02:15:13.402]  Barnes, we'll come back with more calls on the other side.
[02:15:13.402 --> 02:15:14.082]  Hit some other news.
[02:15:14.082 --> 02:15:18.127]  But just in 40 seconds, what do you make of the open rollout of 15-Minute Cities?
[02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:30.213]  Yeah, I mean what they did is they took a concept that was a popular urban planning concept and made things accessible and converted and distorted it into a de facto prison.
[02:15:30.213 --> 02:15:38.395]  So it's extraordinary how they take good ideas, convert them and contort them into terrible ideas, and then we get what the approach is now, which is to take
[02:15:38.775 --> 02:15:44.660]  Something that's supposed to make things more accessible and available to you, and actually make it less accessible and less available to you.
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:45.761]  That's why you have to be careful.
[02:15:45.761 --> 02:15:49.804]  Whenever they promise something for safety or convenience, chances are you get neither.
[02:15:49.804 --> 02:15:51.666]  You just get the deprivation of liberty.
[02:15:51.666 --> 02:15:52.766]  Sean, you're up next.
[02:15:52.766 --> 02:15:54.328]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:15:54.328 --> 02:15:57.911]  Robert Barnes is live.
[02:15:57.911 --> 02:16:00.112]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:16:00.112 --> 02:16:03.255]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:16:03.255 --> 02:16:03.875]  You know why?
[02:16:03.875 --> 02:16:04.956]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:08.059]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:16:08.936 --> 02:16:12.479]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:16:12.479 --> 02:16:17.963]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:16:17.963 --> 02:16:20.945]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:16:20.945 --> 02:16:22.266]  This is reality.
[02:16:22.266 --> 02:16:23.948]  It's just pancakes.
[02:16:23.948 --> 02:16:26.510]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:28.631]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:16:28.631 --> 02:16:31.453]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:16:31.453 --> 02:16:32.674]  You're lying to the public.
[02:16:32.674 --> 02:16:33.715]  It's disgusting.
[02:16:33.715 --> 02:16:35.797]  The media continues to misrepresent
[02:16:36.337 --> 02:16:36.998]  What I've said.
[02:16:36.998 --> 02:16:40.041]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:16:40.041 --> 02:16:44.006]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[02:16:44.006 --> 02:16:45.968]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[02:16:45.968 --> 02:16:48.090]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:16:48.090 --> 02:16:52.435]  We're gonna get fired up about the real thing!
[02:16:52.435 --> 02:16:56.019]  The things that matter!
[02:16:56.019 --> 02:16:57.081]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:16:58.231 --> 02:17:02.234]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:17:02.234 --> 02:17:06.096]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:17:06.096 --> 02:17:08.498]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:17:08.498 --> 02:17:10.900]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:14.262]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:17:14.262 --> 02:17:18.705]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:17:18.705 --> 02:17:21.647]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:17:28.751 --> 02:17:36.133]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:17:36.133 --> 02:17:37.774]  They are nothing but distraction.
[02:17:37.774 --> 02:17:40.575]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:17:40.575 --> 02:17:42.455]  You silenced those voices.
[02:17:42.455 --> 02:17:46.216]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:17:46.216 --> 02:17:52.638]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[02:17:58.652 --> 02:18:10.621]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[02:18:10.621 --> 02:18:14.844]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in
[02:18:15.524 --> 02:18:18.968]  Many of you for years have never gone to InfoWarsHaw.com.

[02:18:27.777 --> 02:18:30.821]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:18:30.821 --> 02:18:31.782]  That's great and I thank you.
[02:18:32.182 --> 02:18:33.723]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:18:33.723 --> 02:18:42.069]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill.
[02:18:42.069 --> 02:18:44.130]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[02:18:44.130 --> 02:18:45.031]  They keep us on air.
[02:18:45.031 --> 02:18:46.812]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:18:46.812 --> 02:18:48.113]  So get off the bench.
[02:18:48.113 --> 02:18:48.953]  Get in the game.
[02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:55.698]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:58.041 --> 02:19:00.764]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:19:00.764 --> 02:19:05.628]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:19:05.628 --> 02:19:10.953]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[02:19:10.953 --> 02:19:20.962]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to MFORWARESTORE.COM and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[02:19:21.662 --> 02:19:27.905]  Infowarstore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[02:19:27.905 --> 02:19:28.925]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[02:19:28.925 --> 02:19:29.826]  Back in stock.
[02:19:29.826 --> 02:19:31.166]  Nitric Boost.
[02:19:31.166 --> 02:19:36.929]  The amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:39.751]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:39.751 --> 02:19:41.592]  Some of the very best products.
[02:19:41.592 --> 02:19:43.714]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTore.
[02:19:43.714 --> 02:19:49.058]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[02:19:49.058 --> 02:19:51.940]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:53.281]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[02:19:53.281 --> 02:19:54.782]  So again, please take action.
[02:19:54.782 --> 02:19:58.925]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today, and I thank you.
[02:19:58.925 --> 02:20:04.830]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:35.759 --> 02:20:38.140]  Folks, if we take some more phone calls, Barnes has got to leave us in 10 minutes.
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:39.561]  I'll continue with all the other callers that are on hold.
[02:20:39.561 --> 02:20:42.042]  We'll get to every single one of you before this hour ends.
[02:20:42.042 --> 02:20:43.623]  We're about to go to Sean and others.
[02:20:43.623 --> 02:20:51.428]  But, I was scheduled to go to Dallas tomorrow night and co-host with Crowder on his official kickoff of his new show.
[02:20:52.589 --> 02:20:55.973]  But he called me this weekend and said, you know, we're going to launch a day early.
[02:20:55.973 --> 02:20:58.456]  We're going to launch tomorrow on Tuesday.
[02:20:58.456 --> 02:21:00.378]  And we'd like you to co-host the first two shows.
[02:21:00.378 --> 02:21:01.559]  You can host your show from there.
[02:21:01.559 --> 02:21:03.462]  I come on right after he does.
[02:21:03.462 --> 02:21:05.544]  He goes off at 11 a.m.
[02:21:05.544 --> 02:21:07.246]  I go live at 11 a.m.
[02:21:07.246 --> 02:21:10.891]  So I'm going to be hosting the whole show tomorrow and Wednesday with Crowder.
[02:21:11.371 --> 02:21:15.235]  He's done a lot for the show, so I want to go up and support him in doing that.
[02:21:15.235 --> 02:21:19.979]  And he also has said we're the biggest draw to his show, so we're happy to work with him on that.
[02:21:19.979 --> 02:21:25.925]  But just in case, I need a break, because I'll be on 8.30 in the morning, basically commercial-free until 11.
[02:21:25.925 --> 02:21:28.227]  I'll be a little cross-eyed after that.
[02:21:28.227 --> 02:21:29.288]  And Barnes is a heavy hitter.
[02:21:29.288 --> 02:21:31.990]  He's going to be hosting Wednesday, the first hour.
[02:21:32.791 --> 02:21:35.112]  And then I will come in after that.
[02:21:35.112 --> 02:21:40.013]  Barnes, you had one more point you were making during the break, and I said, please make that about Trump.
[02:21:40.013 --> 02:21:43.394]  Before we go to calls, you were tying into David Letterman.
[02:21:43.394 --> 02:21:43.854]  Yeah, no doubt.
[02:21:43.854 --> 02:21:48.136]  I mean, this has happened before in New York where someone's been the victim of extortion.
[02:21:48.136 --> 02:21:54.278]  David Letterman had illicit relationships with a bunch of his staff and somebody extorted him.
[02:21:54.278 --> 02:21:58.179]  He ultimately went public about it and paid, but paid hush money during the process.
[02:21:58.639 --> 02:22:01.822]  They didn't accuse him of a crime by paying hush money.
[02:22:01.822 --> 02:22:06.185]  Instead, they accused the people trying to extort him of committing the crime.
[02:22:06.185 --> 02:22:12.410]  And it's important to note in this context, this is who her lawyer has been throughout large parts of this process.
[02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:15.652]  Michael Avenatti, what is he in federal prison for?
[02:22:15.652 --> 02:22:16.313]  Extortion!
[02:22:16.773 --> 02:22:21.454]  So, when he tried to do this to Nike in New York, they prosecuted Avenatti.
[02:22:21.454 --> 02:22:27.095]  Why haven't they prosecuted Stormy Daniels' lawyers that were part of this extortion scheme, rather than prosecute Trump?
[02:22:27.095 --> 02:22:30.475]  That's what shows what an embarrassment this whole prosecution is.
[02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:42.237]  Trump did nothing wrong, wasn't a crime, wasn't a campaign finance violation, didn't meet state criminal standards anyway, but the criminal were the people on behalf of Stormy Daniels extorting Trump, not Trump.
[02:22:42.237 --> 02:22:43.118]  Incredible.
[02:22:43.118 --> 02:22:44.358]  Let's talk to Sean in New Jersey.
[02:22:44.358 --> 02:22:45.758]  Thanks for holding, Sean, you're on the air.
[02:22:47.614 --> 02:22:49.415]  How's it going today, my brothers in Christ?
[02:22:49.415 --> 02:22:51.256]  How are we on this blessed day?
[02:22:51.256 --> 02:22:54.418]  Man, we're fighting hard for the future of humanity.
[02:22:54.418 --> 02:22:56.599]  Amen.
[02:22:56.599 --> 02:23:00.581]  So, my question is for Mr. Barnes.
[02:23:00.581 --> 02:23:08.105]  Under the First Amendment, we're permitted our right to address the government for grievances.
[02:23:08.105 --> 02:23:10.006]  So, hi, sweetheart.
[02:23:10.006 --> 02:23:11.367]  My daughter came out to see me.
[02:23:11.367 --> 02:23:13.588]  It's okay, go ahead.
[02:23:13.588 --> 02:23:14.749]  So, isn't there a way
[02:23:16.306 --> 02:23:35.938]  That we can sign a petition with, at a minimum, 60% of the population and do so with, like legitimately, two proofs of ID, having it notarized, because they don't seem to listen to what we have to say.
[02:23:36.741 --> 02:23:50.166]  So if we do a petition with more than 60% of the population and done so legally, two forms of ID notarized to recall these traitors.
[02:23:50.166 --> 02:23:51.107]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[02:23:51.107 --> 02:23:55.788]  We see a lot of recalls at the state level that have been effective against Governor Davis of California.
[02:23:55.788 --> 02:23:58.209]  What about federal recalls with the petition?
[02:23:58.209 --> 02:24:02.331]  Because it's in the First Amendment that we should petition, but we don't see a lot of that, Barnes.
[02:24:03.777 --> 02:24:05.658]  Yeah, there's not enough of it.
[02:24:05.658 --> 02:24:09.601]  The audience, the speaker, the telephone caller is absolutely correct.
[02:24:09.601 --> 02:24:15.206]  The right to petition for redress of grievances is completely constitutionally protected.
[02:24:15.206 --> 02:24:22.571]  It goes all the way back to the principle that Martin Luther and Wittenberg, now his daughter, might have heard petition for redress of grievances and had her own petition.
[02:24:22.571 --> 02:24:27.315]  But the nature of it, absolutely, filing petitions is absolutely a great idea.
[02:24:27.315 --> 02:24:28.676]  I always support petitions.
[02:24:29.156 --> 02:24:37.047]  Uh, whether it's online or in person or, or physically, however it's done, it's, it's much more effective than people realize or people recognize.
[02:24:37.047 --> 02:24:46.000]  So the petitioning for re, I mean, calling into your congressman, your state legislator, all these things make more impact than people expect because it's so rarely happened.
[02:24:46.491 --> 02:24:48.232]  They rarely get major petitions.
[02:24:48.232 --> 02:24:51.014]  They rarely get tons of calls in Congress.
[02:24:51.014 --> 02:24:52.175]  They don't get any of it at the local level.
[02:24:52.175 --> 02:24:53.156]  That's right.
[02:24:53.156 --> 02:24:55.618]  And a lot of us are politically active, so I'm not beating up the audience.
[02:24:55.618 --> 02:24:57.079]  But for the general public, they've been asleep.
[02:24:57.079 --> 02:25:01.863]  So really, at the end of the day, it's our fault that this has basically unfolded.
[02:25:01.863 --> 02:25:05.205]  Sunken Fever Vendetta, he said, you know, we're all to blame here.
[02:25:05.205 --> 02:25:07.407]  There are those that are more guilty, and they will be held accountable.
[02:25:07.407 --> 02:25:10.869]  But if you want to know who really did it, you only need to look in the mirror.
[02:25:10.869 --> 02:25:13.031]  Andrew in New York on the Trump indictment, what's your view?
[02:25:14.514 --> 02:25:20.296]  Stormy, Avenatti, Cohn, they're all proven in court to be lying about this.
[02:25:20.296 --> 02:25:24.198]  I mean, Melania is a lot better looking than Stormy anyways.
[02:25:24.198 --> 02:25:26.619]  I mean, it's obviously lawfare.
[02:25:26.619 --> 02:25:32.941]  Like, you guys obviously know about how ridiculous it's saying the lawfare has gotten.
[02:25:32.941 --> 02:25:33.881]  No, I agree.
[02:25:33.881 --> 02:25:37.203]  So what do you think is going to happen tomorrow?
[02:25:37.203 --> 02:25:43.105]  Well, I think that there's been some infighting within the Southern District of New York.
[02:25:44.321 --> 02:25:53.866]  I'm not sure if they're going to indict him or not, but it's definitely not going to go anywhere because the higher courts would definitely reverse it.
[02:25:53.866 --> 02:26:02.871]  Well, you have the Southern District that's federal and it's declined, and then you have this Soros DA, who I don't think is being set up, doesn't know he's being set up for a fall.
[02:26:02.871 --> 02:26:05.893]  I mean, no one else will do this, but he's been chosen to do it.
[02:26:05.893 --> 02:26:06.974]  Appreciate your call.
[02:26:06.974 --> 02:26:11.256]  Barnes, I mean, I kind of see they're making this idiot DA walk the plank.
[02:26:12.648 --> 02:26:15.211]  Well, not only that, these people believe two things.
[02:26:15.211 --> 02:26:20.917]  One, if he's loyal to Soros and the Deep State, he knows he's going to get rewarded no matter what over time.
[02:26:20.917 --> 02:26:29.106]  So it's like, you know, why is the German foreign minister saying she doesn't care what the German public thinks and how much economic pain they go through?
[02:26:29.106 --> 02:26:33.131]  She's going to go through with Brussels' agenda of economic war against Russia regardless.
[02:26:33.331 --> 02:26:35.453]  And by the way, she said it like that.
[02:26:35.453 --> 02:26:41.198]  Why would you make an arrogant, supervillain comment like that in public, even if you were a bad person?
[02:26:41.198 --> 02:26:42.820]  Again, why do they love to rub it in, Barnes?
[02:26:44.204 --> 02:26:47.885]  Because she's auditioning for future work in the globalist empire.
[02:26:47.885 --> 02:27:02.088]  She knows that even if she's no longer an elected official, she's guaranteed a future career path with the European Union, with the United Nations, with the George Soros Open Society Foundation, with either Carnegie or Rockefeller or Gates Foundation.
[02:27:02.088 --> 02:27:05.169]  She knows she has an income guaranteed for life.
[02:27:05.749 --> 02:27:06.789]  And let's go further and back you up.
[02:27:06.789 --> 02:27:08.730]  The minister in the Netherlands over-farming
[02:27:34.915 --> 02:27:37.442]  Who said we're going to shut down a third of the farms this year, 90% by 2030, for the earth.
[02:27:40.552 --> 02:27:46.736]  Is totally unpopular, gets removed, and then made the head of the UN program worldwide over farming.
[02:27:46.736 --> 02:27:54.120]  So people always criticize Israel, and I don't hate Israel, but I do not like the fact that Israelis come here and commit crimes, dual citizens run back there.
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:28:02.125]  Well, if you're worried about people running back to Israel, what about people worldwide running to the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, because that's really the real power.
[02:28:02.125 --> 02:28:07.849]  They commit all these crimes, rape us, and then they get teleported up a diplomatic immunity to this whole system.
[02:28:09.398 --> 02:28:09.899]  Exactly.
[02:28:09.899 --> 02:28:12.582]  And then usually there's extortion and blackmail on these people.
[02:28:12.582 --> 02:28:17.247]  Like the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court bringing the bogus arrest warrant against Putin.
[02:28:17.247 --> 02:28:21.892]  His brother is a convicted pedophile, connected to pedophilia rings.
[02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:24.735]  So, you know, they also often have blackmail on all these people too.
[02:28:25.916 --> 02:28:30.098]  By the way, I actually hit your Skype button and cut you off for a minute.
[02:28:30.098 --> 02:28:34.881]  I know you got to go, Barnes, but do five more minutes because I want to talk about the Putin indictment by the U.N.
[02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:38.003]  and I almost forgot I wanted to cover this when you first came on.
[02:28:38.003 --> 02:28:40.224]  Big developments in the Jeffrey Epstein case, so thank you.
[02:28:40.224 --> 02:28:43.146]  We'll come right back with what you were just saying and then I'm over here
[02:28:43.826 --> 02:28:45.327]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[02:29:06.348 --> 02:29:07.669]  I want you all to know something.
[02:29:07.669 --> 02:29:09.630]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:13.192]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:29:13.192 --> 02:29:16.114]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:29:16.114 --> 02:29:20.557]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:29:20.557 --> 02:29:22.758]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:22.758 --> 02:29:26.281]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:29:26.281 --> 02:29:29.743]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:29:30.003 --> 02:29:32.864]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:29:32.864 --> 02:29:33.905]  Years ago.
[02:29:33.905 --> 02:29:35.986]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:29:35.986 --> 02:29:37.967]  Not for a second.
[02:29:37.967 --> 02:29:40.508]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:29:40.508 --> 02:29:42.949]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:29:42.949 --> 02:29:46.071]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:29:46.071 --> 02:29:50.733]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:29:58.243 --> 02:30:00.223]  I've got some good news.
[02:30:00.223 --> 02:30:07.105]  Our high-quality supplements really work, and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[02:30:07.105 --> 02:30:07.925]  That's the good news.
[02:30:07.925 --> 02:30:09.065]  They're amazing.
[02:30:09.065 --> 02:30:17.246]  The bad news is, around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWareStore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[02:30:17.246 --> 02:30:20.687]  So you're missing out on these products, plus it funds the InfoWare.
[02:30:20.687 --> 02:30:25.608]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:30:25.608 --> 02:30:26.448]  Think what would happen.
[02:30:27.368 --> 02:30:40.917]  If those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarStore.com and got some of these amazing products, I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation, to get one of the biggest effects, so you reorder it and see how great it is.
[02:30:40.917 --> 02:30:49.883]  Also, we've got the super high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oil that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones, as well.
[02:30:49.883 --> 02:30:51.264]  Or Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:30:51.264 --> 02:30:55.687]  Just go try the product, fund the InfoWar, and help us defeat the new order together.
[02:30:55.687 --> 02:30:56.948]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:30:58.169 --> 02:31:00.251]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:03.555]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:31:03.555 --> 02:31:04.135]  You know why?
[02:31:04.135 --> 02:31:05.617]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:31:05.617 --> 02:31:09.241]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:31:09.241 --> 02:31:12.764]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:31:12.764 --> 02:31:16.188]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:31:18.226 --> 02:31:21.209]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:31:21.209 --> 02:31:22.411]  This is reality.
[02:31:22.411 --> 02:31:24.233]  It's just pancakes.
[02:31:24.233 --> 02:31:26.795]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:31:26.795 --> 02:31:28.898]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:31:28.898 --> 02:31:31.741]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:31:31.741 --> 02:31:32.962]  You're lying to the public.
[02:31:32.962 --> 02:31:33.703]  It's disgusting.
[02:31:33.963 --> 02:31:37.384]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:31:37.384 --> 02:31:40.305]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:31:40.305 --> 02:31:44.287]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[02:31:44.287 --> 02:31:46.247]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[02:31:46.247 --> 02:31:48.388]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:31:48.388 --> 02:31:50.589]  We're gonna get fired up about the real thing!
[02:31:50.589 --> 02:31:51.649]  The things that matter!
[02:31:59.335 --> 02:32:02.457]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:32:02.457 --> 02:32:04.758]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:32:04.758 --> 02:32:08.701]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:32:08.701 --> 02:32:17.647]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:32:17.647 --> 02:32:24.531]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:32:24.531 --> 02:32:25.432]  It's really just incredible.
[02:32:26.443 --> 02:32:29.324]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:32:29.324 --> 02:32:35.867]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:32:35.867 --> 02:32:36.807]  I know you spread the word.
[02:32:36.807 --> 02:32:37.747]  I know you pray for us.
[02:32:37.747 --> 02:32:38.348]  That's wonderful.
[02:32:38.348 --> 02:32:38.908]  Keep doing it.
[02:32:38.908 --> 02:32:45.950]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:47.151]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:32:47.871 --> 02:32:52.135]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[02:32:52.135 --> 02:32:57.099]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:32:57.099 --> 02:32:58.960]  Please take action now.
[02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:04.865]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.898 --> 02:33:20.848]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:29.104 --> 02:33:34.305]  Well, I always like doing my broadcast, but I really love it.
[02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:37.945]  Robert Barnes is on with us.
[02:33:37.945 --> 02:33:39.126]  He'll leave us here in a few minutes.
[02:33:39.126 --> 02:33:41.306]  There's so much breaking news, a lot of it good.
[02:33:41.306 --> 02:33:49.988]  We're going to be hitting here, but he got cut off by the break talking about the UN prosecutor that's gone after Putin.
[02:33:49.988 --> 02:33:56.329]  Even John Bolton has come out and said this isn't good, of all people.
[02:33:56.329 --> 02:33:58.449]  Is the UN going to have the power to arrest whoever they want?
[02:33:59.781 --> 02:34:01.682]  They don't even have due process?
[02:34:01.682 --> 02:34:06.706]  So you were getting into the prosecutor having skeletons in his closet, Robert?
[02:34:06.706 --> 02:34:13.571]  Yeah, with a lot of these, when people try to understand why does somebody like the Soros DA do something that could backfire on him politically?
[02:34:13.571 --> 02:34:15.773]  Why do some people commit political suicide?
[02:34:15.773 --> 02:34:21.697]  Why do they elevate the interest of globalists and explicitly say they're doing so at the expense of their own domestic political careers?
[02:34:22.077 --> 02:34:22.577]  We're good to go.
[02:34:38.604 --> 02:34:40.666]  It's because often they have compromise on them.
[02:34:40.666 --> 02:34:42.869]  Again, it's an example of confession through projection.
[02:34:42.869 --> 02:34:44.351]  Look at what they're accusing Trump of.
[02:34:44.351 --> 02:34:45.172]  It's what they're guilty of.
[02:34:45.172 --> 02:34:50.438]  They're literally political kamikazes because they were put in there as globalist agents to carry out a mission.
[02:34:50.438 --> 02:34:52.781]  There was never a debate on whether they were going to betray.
[02:34:52.781 --> 02:34:55.084]  They had nothing but disdain for the constituency.
[02:34:56.613 --> 02:35:04.845]  Exactly, and they often have complicity, and there's usually a Hoover-style blackmail file on these people.
[02:35:04.845 --> 02:35:07.649]  So the prosecutor... He was a 14-year-old, as you said, sex operative.
[02:35:11.562 --> 02:35:12.343]  Exactly.
[02:35:12.343 --> 02:35:26.158]  And so the prosecutor who's led the effort at the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not part of, India is not part of, China is not part of, Russia is now rejected, but so its legal authority is non-existent because it's become so politically weaponized.
[02:35:26.158 --> 02:35:29.461]  But who is this prosecutor that's bringing this case against Putin?
[02:35:29.461 --> 02:35:32.024]  He's someone who has family ties to a pedophile ring.
[02:35:32.464 --> 02:35:37.307]  So it's not a coincidence that there's a reason why Jeffrey Epstein existed.
[02:35:37.307 --> 02:35:43.069]  There's a reason why his list, his real client list, not his phone list, is still secret and hidden.
[02:35:43.069 --> 02:35:45.451]  It's because of what's being exposed in the U.S.
[02:35:45.451 --> 02:35:47.852]  Virgin Islands lawsuit against Chase Bank.
[02:35:48.172 --> 02:35:50.814]  Which was that high-ranking Chase bankers are implicated.
[02:35:50.814 --> 02:35:52.636]  The Mossad is implicated.
[02:35:52.636 --> 02:35:54.017]  MI6 is implicated.
[02:35:54.017 --> 02:35:56.099]  It goes back to why Ghislaine Maxwell.
[02:35:56.099 --> 02:35:58.301]  Ghislaine Maxwell's father is Robert Maxwell.
[02:35:58.301 --> 02:36:03.666]  Robert Maxwell was an Intel operative connected to the KGB, the Mossad, the Stasi, and the MI6.
[02:36:04.306 --> 02:36:07.088]  Well, that was my point about the lawsuit in the Virgin Islands.
[02:36:07.088 --> 02:36:07.749]  Here it is right here.
[02:36:07.749 --> 02:36:08.309]  JP Morgan Chase, CNBC.
[02:36:33.322 --> 02:36:38.004]  Can be sued by Virgin Islands over Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking claims.
[02:36:38.004 --> 02:36:41.965]  That just broke today.
[02:36:41.965 --> 02:36:53.269]  Also, we have another federal judge saying that these lawsuits on people that confirmed by the Twitter files that they were censored by Biden can go forward.
[02:36:53.269 --> 02:36:57.010]  Biden White House accused of silencing opposition views on Opposition Ship Enterprise.
[02:36:57.010 --> 02:36:59.431]  Now the judge just ruled that can go forward.
[02:36:59.431 --> 02:37:01.232]  Let's talk about the JP Morgan situation.
[02:37:01.232 --> 02:37:01.612]  That's big.
[02:37:03.288 --> 02:37:03.728]  Oh, completely.
[02:37:03.728 --> 02:37:04.289]  I mean, J.P.
[02:37:04.289 --> 02:37:05.670]  Morgan was neck deep in this.
[02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:13.576]  I mean, the other reason they want to centralize banking controls is that they want to have centralized control over money laundering.
[02:37:13.576 --> 02:37:16.439]  That all of these banks, I mean, you have Credit Suisse went under.
[02:37:16.439 --> 02:37:17.359]  And who got them?
[02:37:17.359 --> 02:37:18.140]  UBS.
[02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:20.382]  Who's the biggest global money launderer in the last 25 years?
[02:37:20.382 --> 02:37:20.442]  UBS.
[02:37:22.163 --> 02:37:23.864]  And the UBS course, not alone.
[02:37:23.864 --> 02:37:25.706]  HSBC was one of the big ones.
[02:37:25.706 --> 02:37:30.650]  We remember the stories that broke about BCCI, which showed this is how the model operates.
[02:37:30.650 --> 02:37:31.830]  This is the template.
[02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:32.931]  This is the pattern.
[02:37:32.931 --> 02:37:33.572]  Well, J.P.
[02:37:33.572 --> 02:37:48.443]  Morgan Chase, properly named for the guy who helped found the Fed at Jekyll Island in the early 1900s, with the formation and the planning of it, being John Pyrmont Morgan himself, being the lead orchestrator and organizer of it,
[02:37:48.803 --> 02:37:54.448]  Well, they were the main bank facilitating all the activities of Epstein, but it went beyond that.
[02:37:54.448 --> 02:38:01.555]  The text and emails show the high-ranking bank executives making Snow White-type jokes.
[02:38:01.555 --> 02:38:04.478]  And you don't have to be a genius to know what that's in reference to.
[02:38:05.018 --> 02:38:08.120]  So this was knowing complicity and culpability.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:14.885]  And here you have to wonder, what were some of the compromise lawyers doing that were supposedly representing Epstein victims?
[02:38:14.885 --> 02:38:17.547]  People like David Bowies, other people.
[02:38:17.547 --> 02:38:19.568]  Why didn't they ever sue?
[02:38:19.568 --> 02:38:29.155]  Not only did they never sue Clinton, never sue Gore, even though there were ties to both of them in Epstein, never sued George Stephanopoulos or anybody else tied to Epstein, never sued Bill Gates.
[02:38:29.455 --> 02:38:31.137]  No, he was tied to Epstein.
[02:38:31.137 --> 02:38:36.363]  Instead, they tried to take out Dershowitz based on what we now know were bogus claims against Dershowitz.
[02:38:36.363 --> 02:38:39.466]  But why did they never try to take out JPMorgan Chase?
[02:38:39.466 --> 02:38:40.968]  Why did they never sue him?
[02:38:40.968 --> 02:38:46.594]  Because they know going after somebody who was innocent like Dershowitz, and he was, folks, would be a dead end.
[02:38:49.774 --> 02:38:58.739]  Their goal was to use the Epstein case to defame Dershowitz while protecting the real criminals and culprits behind the Epstein empire.
[02:38:58.739 --> 02:39:01.160]  That's what the Southern District of New York was about.
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:11.966]  It was about containing the Epstein case, indict him, he suicides himself, he Clintons himself, like that recent person somehow did on a plane.
[02:39:11.966 --> 02:39:16.288]  It's amazing, the Clinton death curse has got to be the worst death curse in the history
[02:39:16.428 --> 02:39:21.091]  Yeah, when I saw Clinton official top lawyer dies in plane, I thought it was a crash.
[02:39:21.091 --> 02:39:24.913]  Then I read, everybody else is fine, she broke her neck, she's dead on the plane.
[02:39:24.913 --> 02:39:28.235]  I was thinking of Ron Brown, the Treasury Secretary or the Commerce Secretary.
[02:39:28.235 --> 02:39:30.857]  So in closing here, pulling back.
[02:39:32.128 --> 02:39:36.211]  The weaponization hearings, destroying them, all their criminality.
[02:39:36.211 --> 02:39:44.078]  Redfield coming out two weeks ago saying, Fauci lied, I knew it was man-made, we released the worst plague ever.
[02:39:44.078 --> 02:39:50.483]  On every front, Jan 6, all the truth coming out, on every front, everything the deep state's done is blowing up in their face.
[02:39:50.483 --> 02:39:52.345]  How would you quantify why that's happening?
[02:39:53.928 --> 02:39:59.370]  So it's critical there's continued to be pushback on behalf of the popular side of the equation.
[02:39:59.370 --> 02:39:59.710]  J.D.
[02:39:59.710 --> 02:40:09.493]  Vance has done some great work on this, pushing back against what's happening in East Palestine, Ohio, pushing back against the Iraq War recently, reminding everybody what a disaster and debacle that was.
[02:40:10.133 --> 02:40:20.300]  So that the populist voice continues to be heard because places like InfoWars exist and the InfoWars audience exist and the InfoWars audience won't go away no matter how much lawfare is waged against them.
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:27.124]  That's part of the reason why the people should not underestimate their ordinary voice, their Paul Revere effect on the American court of public opinion.
[02:40:27.124 --> 02:40:37.531]  It keeps showing up and keeps pushing back and keeps resisting these globalist agendas and globalist plans that continue to fall apart and fail when they're exposed to the public scrutiny and public truth.
[02:40:37.711 --> 02:40:41.532]  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you this in closing, and you gotta go or come back and take calls, you gotta leave.
[02:40:41.532 --> 02:40:44.794]  And this isn't me kissing your ass, it's Celebrating Success.
[02:40:44.794 --> 02:40:54.337]  You've been around, I knew who you were, you know, way back 20 years ago with the whole Wesley Snipes case and, you know, we've been having you on for many years, you've always been popular.
[02:40:54.337 --> 02:41:00.699]  But I look at you and Viva Frye, your co-host, he's being retweeted daily by Elon Musk.
[02:41:00.699 --> 02:41:04.981]  You guys are now not reaching hundreds of thousands a day, you're reaching millions a day, your show's exploded.
[02:41:05.781 --> 02:41:18.846]  And it's not like you came along later like, you know, so many other people, which is fine with me, like the, you know, folks that are out there, like Russell Branton people, which is great.
[02:41:18.846 --> 02:41:20.387]  We're not mad they're adopting the truth now.
[02:41:20.387 --> 02:41:21.427]  We expect that.
[02:41:21.427 --> 02:41:22.568]  We don't territorialize it.
[02:41:22.568 --> 02:41:23.288]  We love it.
[02:41:23.288 --> 02:41:25.329]  But, you know, you've been awake the whole time.
[02:41:25.329 --> 02:41:29.950]  But just the manifestation of that victory is huge, and it shows we're winning.
[02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:31.711]  I use the example of the listeners every day.
[02:41:31.711 --> 02:41:32.771]  I go out in public all the time.
[02:41:34.986 --> 02:41:35.966]  Hate now.
[02:41:35.966 --> 02:41:38.647]  Okay, I used to get 95% love, but a lot of hate.
[02:41:38.647 --> 02:41:39.427]  Okay?
[02:41:39.427 --> 02:41:40.068]  No hate.
[02:41:40.068 --> 02:41:41.608]  I mean, maybe I'm jinxing myself.
[02:41:41.608 --> 02:41:45.969]  I'll get some hate soon, but no hate for like four or five months.
[02:41:45.969 --> 02:41:47.090]  I mean, no hate.
[02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:48.190]  Nothing but love.
[02:41:48.190 --> 02:41:51.131]  So it shows that there's a critical awakening.
[02:41:51.131 --> 02:41:52.631]  How do people find your show?
[02:41:52.631 --> 02:41:53.752]  How do people find Robert Barnes?
[02:41:53.752 --> 02:41:54.652]  How do they find Viva Frye?
[02:41:56.081 --> 02:42:08.418]  Sure, so yeah, people can go to one location that has all the content, including exclusive content, hush-hush videos and alternative theories about what's happened in the past, predicted what was happening with January 6th, right after January 6th.
[02:42:08.418 --> 02:42:10.661]  You can go to Viva Barnes Law.
[02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:16.705]  And it's also a great community, great curational tool.
[02:42:16.705 --> 02:42:19.147]  We get 500 posts a day from a bunch of people.
[02:42:19.147 --> 02:42:21.828]  The audience is much like the InfoWars audience.
[02:42:21.828 --> 02:42:26.131]  The power of VivaBarnesLaw.locals.com is the audience.
[02:42:26.131 --> 02:42:37.099]  Ordinary people who care about the country, who are helping to change the country in ways they don't even fully understand or appreciate yet, but their children and their grandchildren, their great-grandchildren will be the great recipients and beneficiaries of.
[02:42:37.179 --> 02:42:46.802]  And that was my point talking about your success is, listeners are out there, they're independent, they're not connected to all this in a massive way, but an individual way.
[02:42:46.802 --> 02:42:50.203]  They need to know we're winning together, but we haven't won the war yet.
[02:42:50.203 --> 02:42:51.523]  We're winning major battles.
[02:42:51.523 --> 02:42:54.084]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[02:42:54.084 --> 02:42:54.844]  Glad to be here.
[02:42:54.844 --> 02:42:55.945]  I'm going to go right back to your calls.
[02:42:55.945 --> 02:42:58.606]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:42:58.606 --> 02:43:01.606]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:43:06.434 --> 02:43:07.755]  I want you all to know something.
[02:43:07.755 --> 02:43:09.716]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:43:09.716 --> 02:43:13.258]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:43:13.258 --> 02:43:16.400]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:20.643]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[02:43:20.643 --> 02:43:22.844]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:43:22.844 --> 02:43:26.367]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:43:26.367 --> 02:43:29.809]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:43:30.089 --> 02:43:32.971]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:43:32.971 --> 02:43:33.991]  Years ago.
[02:43:33.991 --> 02:43:36.072]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[02:43:36.072 --> 02:43:38.054]  Not for a second.
[02:43:38.054 --> 02:43:40.575]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:43:40.575 --> 02:43:43.056]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:43:43.056 --> 02:43:46.178]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:43:46.178 --> 02:43:47.739]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[02:43:47.739 --> 02:43:50.821]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:43:58.383 --> 02:44:00.024]  InfoWars.
[02:44:00.024 --> 02:44:02.646]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:44:02.646 --> 02:44:04.387]  This is their big move.
[02:44:04.387 --> 02:44:08.189]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:44:08.189 --> 02:44:09.890]  He doesn't care.
[02:44:09.890 --> 02:44:11.150]  That's not his job.
[02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:12.891]  He's not the President of the United States.
[02:44:12.891 --> 02:44:16.754]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:16.754 --> 02:44:21.256]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:21.256 --> 02:44:22.357]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:23.124 --> 02:44:26.405]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:44:26.405 --> 02:44:27.606]  No.
[02:44:27.606 --> 02:44:28.426]  No.
[02:44:28.426 --> 02:44:29.186]  No.
[02:44:29.186 --> 02:44:30.087]  Exactly.
[02:44:30.087 --> 02:44:33.668]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.668 --> 02:44:36.749]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:36.749 --> 02:44:39.230]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:39.230 --> 02:44:41.731]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:41.731 --> 02:44:45.352]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:45.352 --> 02:44:47.873]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:44:47.873 --> 02:44:48.273]  You're right!
[02:44:48.573 --> 02:44:53.325]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[02:44:53.325 --> 02:44:54.869]  And we say no to your war!
[02:45:00.117 --> 02:45:09.826]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[02:45:09.826 --> 02:45:13.509]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.

[02:45:49.155 --> 02:45:51.597]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[02:45:51.597 --> 02:45:52.477]  We didn't have them for sale.
[02:45:52.477 --> 02:45:54.138]  But now, I signed the last books.
[02:45:54.138 --> 02:45:58.301]  You can get them right now.
[02:45:58.301 --> 02:46:07.806]  We now have three new game-changing products that are in stock at InfoWarsTore.com, and one of our best-selling products sold out for over a year that's now back in stock.

[02:46:21.015 --> 02:46:22.476]  This one is really special.

[02:47:13.294 --> 02:47:14.855]  They came and took it all away.
[02:47:14.855 --> 02:47:17.137]  It was an inside job.
[02:47:17.137 --> 02:47:21.801]  The way it always is.
[02:47:53.742 --> 02:47:55.363]  Michael in D.C., thanks for calling.
[02:47:55.363 --> 02:47:58.826]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:58.826 --> 02:48:00.467]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:48:00.467 --> 02:48:01.568]  This is Michael Graves.
[02:48:01.568 --> 02:48:03.569]  I've been on your program a couple of times.
[02:48:03.569 --> 02:48:04.930]  I was in a D.C.
[02:48:04.930 --> 02:48:10.394]  courtroom this morning testifying in defense of the Proud Boys of January 25th.
[02:48:10.394 --> 02:48:11.395]  You're the Misfits singer.
[02:48:12.498 --> 02:48:12.838]  I am.
[02:48:12.838 --> 02:48:14.039]  Hey, buddy.
[02:48:14.039 --> 02:48:14.579]  I love you, man.
[02:48:14.579 --> 02:48:16.280]  How you doing?
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:17.481]  I'm good, Alex.
[02:48:17.481 --> 02:48:19.462]  I'm good.
[02:48:19.462 --> 02:48:29.788]  Listen, I want to tell everybody, these prosecutors and all the things that support them, they don't care about the truth.
[02:48:29.788 --> 02:48:33.170]  They know that even if they know the truth, they don't care about the truth.
[02:48:34.034 --> 02:48:39.983]  And they are willing to do anything to get their prosecutions in place.
[02:48:39.983 --> 02:48:42.387]  They don't care if you're a priest, a pastor.
[02:48:42.387 --> 02:48:44.250]  They don't care if you're in the military.
[02:48:44.250 --> 02:48:46.713]  They will come for all of us.
[02:48:46.713 --> 02:48:49.638]  The truth is a byproduct.
[02:48:50.453 --> 02:48:51.674]  Of what they're after.
[02:48:51.674 --> 02:48:52.714]  They don't care.
[02:48:52.714 --> 02:48:54.755]  By the way, brother, you haven't been on my show in a while.
[02:48:54.755 --> 02:48:55.916]  You've been on the others.
[02:48:55.916 --> 02:48:57.497]  A month ago, I said, hey, we ought to get him on.
[02:48:57.497 --> 02:49:00.638]  I knew you were following and covering the trial.
[02:49:00.638 --> 02:49:02.419]  We should get you on as a guest this week.
[02:49:02.419 --> 02:49:05.781]  Let's just talk about what you witnessed.
[02:49:05.781 --> 02:49:07.462]  Alex, any time.
[02:49:07.462 --> 02:49:07.982]  Any time.
[02:49:07.982 --> 02:49:09.803]  So in a nutshell, tell us what you're witnessing.
[02:49:09.803 --> 02:49:12.204]  And then when we put you on hold, we'll set you up as a guest this week.
[02:49:12.204 --> 02:49:15.066]  But go ahead.
[02:49:15.066 --> 02:49:17.887]  I'm witnessing what everybody else sees.
[02:49:17.887 --> 02:49:19.328]  I mean, in the courtroom,
[02:49:20.191 --> 02:49:31.177]  The prosecutors are mealy-eyed, you know, weasel-looking jerks that are just attacking everybody.
[02:49:31.177 --> 02:49:36.660]  They're visiting, they're going to see the different defendants.
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:43.844]  I heard about them showing up at defendants' houses and intimidating people.
[02:49:44.898 --> 02:49:55.060]  Oh, I mean the judge said, we got the documents, that the feds ran the attack, and they had informants say they were not doing anything violent, and they gave them all the secret files on accident.
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:59.761]  For the first time in modern history that we've ever heard of, a judge said they're allowed to destroy evidence.
[02:49:59.761 --> 02:50:02.962]  I mean, that came out two weeks ago.
[02:50:02.962 --> 02:50:08.543]  Everybody that has eyes to see and ears to hear know what the truth is and what's happening.
[02:50:09.307 --> 02:50:15.832]  I think this Trump indictment, aside of the legal things that are going on, is also a provocation.
[02:50:15.832 --> 02:50:19.675]  They're trying to provoke us into violence.
[02:50:19.675 --> 02:50:35.608]  Or they're trying to provoke us to gather together so that they can instigate and agitate and provoke violence to then prosecute us, to continue to get us, move people like me, obviously people like you and Owen.
[02:50:36.512 --> 02:50:39.955]  And everybody else off the chessboard, they're trying to intimidate us.
[02:50:39.955 --> 02:50:49.722]  Your first caller, Rob, his solutions were incredible where we can have prayer vigils or these protests where we're being smart.
[02:50:49.722 --> 02:50:58.969]  Paul Joseph Watson had a put up on Truth Social a poll and polling people
[02:50:59.855 --> 02:51:08.220]  Whether they believe that this is another January 6th setup and 85% of the people that responded to that poll said yes.
[02:51:08.220 --> 02:51:16.525]  So we know what they're trying to do and we cannot walk through that door and have it again because it doesn't matter.
[02:51:16.525 --> 02:51:19.787]  The judges don't care and the prosecutors don't care.
[02:51:19.787 --> 02:51:22.208]  They're just trying to to get us all
[02:51:24.581 --> 02:51:28.924]  It's a total criminal commitment.
[02:51:28.924 --> 02:51:33.087]  We see it with you and we see it with Roger Stone and so many others.
[02:51:33.087 --> 02:51:36.209]  The process is the punishment.
[02:51:36.209 --> 02:51:38.090]  The process is the punishment.
[02:51:38.090 --> 02:51:50.039]  So for people like me and Joe Biggs and all these other people that are trying to defend themselves that don't have, in a lot of the cases, the means to defend themselves
[02:51:52.252 --> 02:52:02.094]  They're rolling the bus over them and they're trying to intimidate us all into just staying in our houses and quarreling.
[02:52:02.094 --> 02:52:06.335]  So you're there covering the trial and you're witnessing all this?
[02:52:06.335 --> 02:52:09.276]  I'm actually on my way home to see my family.
[02:52:09.276 --> 02:52:11.596]  I've been out for a couple weeks now.
[02:52:11.596 --> 02:52:17.237]  My birthday is tomorrow so I'm going to go home and be with my family.
[02:52:17.237 --> 02:52:20.138]  But you're saying you've never even heard of anything like what you're witnessing?
[02:52:21.608 --> 02:52:23.790]  No, no.
[02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:29.877]  I've never experienced anything like this in my life.
[02:52:29.877 --> 02:52:36.563]  What do you make of this so-called Trump judge?
[02:52:36.563 --> 02:52:40.527]  I think that he's obviously part of the problem.
[02:52:40.527 --> 02:52:43.130]  He's part of the problem because he's not allowing
[02:52:44.127 --> 02:52:47.650]  Well look, if they'll rig everything, they'll rig anything.
[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:14.702]  Okay, so they'll reg anything, they'll reg everything.
[02:53:14.702 --> 02:53:16.563]  I mean, we know this.
[02:53:16.563 --> 02:53:19.545]  Hey, come on the show soon, whenever you want to.
[02:53:19.545 --> 02:53:20.825]  I really appreciate you calling in, brother.
[02:53:20.825 --> 02:53:22.126]  Great work.
[02:53:22.126 --> 02:53:23.527]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:53:23.527 --> 02:53:27.069]  The quintessential punk band is the Misfits.
[02:53:27.069 --> 02:53:29.551]  And all three of their singers have been amazing.
[02:53:29.551 --> 02:53:34.574]  And it's all not for children to listen to, but it's pretty good.
[02:53:34.574 --> 02:53:36.375]  Pretty good, to say the least.
[02:53:36.375 --> 02:53:38.736]  Started with Evil Elvis and just moved on from there.
[02:53:38.736 --> 02:53:40.417]  Let's go to Tim in Seattle.
[02:53:40.417 --> 02:53:40.918]  You're on the air.
[02:53:40.918 --> 02:53:41.418]  Thanks for holding.
[02:53:42.884 --> 02:53:43.945]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:53:43.945 --> 02:53:46.327]  What an amazing show.
[02:53:46.327 --> 02:53:49.009]  I'm the guy in Seattle that's been bullhorning the Gates Foundation.
[02:53:49.009 --> 02:53:50.530]  You had me on your show last year.
[02:53:50.530 --> 02:53:51.972]  Yes, I did.
[02:53:51.972 --> 02:53:54.634]  Yeah, I just want to encourage everybody to not live in fear.
[02:53:54.634 --> 02:53:56.916]  We must live in freedom.
[02:53:56.916 --> 02:53:59.518]  It's important that we do that.
[02:53:59.518 --> 02:54:05.343]  So, as far as the reaction to what Trump's call for protest and everybody
[02:54:06.355 --> 02:54:08.876]  Even if they're doing that, and Trump might not hear it.
[02:54:08.876 --> 02:54:11.376]  Yeah, even though they're going to try to provocateur it, we're watching this time.
[02:54:11.376 --> 02:54:12.136]  We know what to look for.
[02:54:12.136 --> 02:54:12.876]  I agree.
[02:54:12.876 --> 02:54:16.497]  We shouldn't have our free speech chilled.
[02:54:16.497 --> 02:54:17.237]  No, we shouldn't.
[02:54:17.237 --> 02:54:22.978]  We should have, like I said earlier on Harrison's show, we should have been protesting the entire time.
[02:54:22.978 --> 02:54:28.379]  And in honor of the Proud Boys and the Patriots Locked Up, I made a decision to never stop.
[02:54:28.379 --> 02:54:29.759]  So it's important.
[02:54:29.759 --> 02:54:33.800]  And I'm curious, because you were saying that that foundation, that mystery foundation,
[02:54:34.781 --> 02:54:43.085]  Are they afraid of your show because I'm out there in their parking lot, in their driveway, bullhorning your broadcast live?
[02:54:43.085 --> 02:54:47.107]  Well, I'll cut it from three foundations to two.
[02:54:47.107 --> 02:54:48.808]  No, it's not the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:54:48.808 --> 02:54:54.071]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation or it's the Carnegie Foundation, which is the same thing.
[02:54:54.071 --> 02:54:55.652]  But I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:54:55.652 --> 02:54:58.353]  Bill Gates is their minion.
[02:54:58.353 --> 02:54:59.734]  Yeah, Bill Gates is their minion.
[02:54:59.734 --> 02:55:03.356]  I mean, but he's got no power over me because I'm not steering what
[02:55:03.857 --> 02:55:04.537]  He can do to me.
[02:55:04.537 --> 02:55:07.959]  I'm fearing what I can do to the future if I don't act.
[02:55:07.959 --> 02:55:09.299]  Brother, keep it up.
[02:55:09.299 --> 02:55:10.340]  I'll give you an example.
[02:55:10.340 --> 02:55:22.424]  Two years ago, they attacked Joe Rogan for having me on and said Jones made it up that Bill Gates said 80% of people taking the shot are getting sick in their study.
[02:55:22.424 --> 02:55:25.465]  Joe just played the clip of him on CBS News admitting it.
[02:55:25.465 --> 02:55:28.306]  That got, last time I checked, 10 million views.
[02:55:28.306 --> 02:55:32.208]  It had over a million comments and literally you could read for two hours
[02:55:34.383 --> 02:55:36.185]  The comments on Instagram.
[02:55:36.185 --> 02:55:37.286]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:55:37.286 --> 02:55:44.293]  You could read the comments for two hours and not find one pro Bill Gates comment.
[02:55:44.293 --> 02:55:46.094]  So now he's on a world tour.
[02:55:46.094 --> 02:55:48.577]  What a great guy he is and all this crap.
[02:55:48.577 --> 02:55:49.778]  And I meant to hit that yesterday.
[02:55:49.778 --> 02:55:50.499]  I barely covered it.
[02:55:50.499 --> 02:55:56.484]  That guy's pulled it from the Sunday stack so tomorrow I can cover it.
[02:55:56.484 --> 02:55:56.725]  Out of
[02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:00.696]  Stephen Crowder Studios.
[02:56:00.696 --> 02:56:01.457]  I'm Carlos with him.
[02:56:01.457 --> 02:56:04.279]  I'm going to host my show from his studios tomorrow.
[02:56:04.279 --> 02:56:08.201]  ABC News admits more polio caused by Bill Gates' vaccine again.
[02:56:08.201 --> 02:56:11.364]  I mean, you just can't make that up.
[02:56:11.364 --> 02:56:12.765]  We'll go on a break.
[02:56:12.765 --> 02:56:14.566]  Spring and others, we're going to come right back to you.
[02:56:14.566 --> 02:56:16.527]  But I'm going to say this again.
[02:56:16.527 --> 02:56:25.434]  Infowars is operating in the absolute edge of black.
[02:56:26.505 --> 02:56:30.970]  And God just keeps us there, right on the edge of black, right on the edge of red.
[02:56:30.970 --> 02:56:35.916]  And... If I don't admit that to you, and if I don't beg you...
[02:56:36.792 --> 02:56:38.893]  Then it's my fault we go under.
[02:56:38.893 --> 02:56:41.515]  So we've got great products you need, and we really need your support.
[02:56:41.515 --> 02:56:45.478]  That's why they have articles every day saying Alex Jones has hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:56:45.478 --> 02:56:48.260]  Alex Jones, none of it's true, folks.
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:55.524]  On my children, may I be struck by lightning if I've got a million dollars cash, or if we're not in trouble and I'm lying.
[02:56:55.524 --> 02:56:58.186]  And I'd like to tempt God, but in front of everybody, I swear to you
[02:57:00.658 --> 02:57:04.940]  On my children, that everything I've said here has been consciously true.
[02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:10.282]  Doesn't mean I don't make mistakes sometimes, but when it comes to finances, I can tell you we are out of money.
[02:57:10.282 --> 02:57:11.842]  We're just paying the bills.
[02:57:11.842 --> 02:57:12.703]  We need support.
[02:57:12.703 --> 02:57:17.565]  I need you to decide to keep us on air and go to mFullerTour.com and get the best CBD oil.
[02:57:17.565 --> 02:57:25.408]  Get incredible other products like our Bone Broth and like our prebiotics back in stock and Physibagnesium and Pazzo Beets and Ultra 12 and so much more.
[02:57:26.343 --> 02:57:31.246]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[02:57:55.592 --> 02:57:59.617]  Dr. Jones Natural's Turmeric Toothpaste that just came into stock.
[02:57:59.617 --> 02:58:02.881]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[02:58:02.881 --> 02:58:06.845]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[02:58:06.845 --> 02:58:11.611]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things for the body.
[02:58:11.611 --> 02:58:14.475]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[02:58:15.035 --> 02:58:16.256]  It is just dynamite.
[02:58:16.256 --> 02:58:20.839]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[02:58:20.839 --> 02:58:25.082]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at InFloorStore.com.
[02:58:25.082 --> 02:58:27.804]  Dr. Jones Naturals Turmeric Toothpaste.
[02:58:27.804 --> 02:58:31.046]  And while you're at it, check out the new Ashwagandha line of products.

[02:58:41.895 --> 02:58:44.397]  They're amazing products, and they fund the InfoWar.

[02:58:48.301 --> 02:58:50.384]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:58:50.384 --> 02:58:53.647]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:58:53.647 --> 02:58:54.267]  You know why?
[02:58:54.267 --> 02:58:55.729]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:58:55.729 --> 02:58:58.492]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:58:59.329 --> 02:59:02.872]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:59:02.872 --> 02:59:08.356]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:59:08.356 --> 02:59:11.318]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:59:11.318 --> 02:59:12.659]  This is reality.
[02:59:12.659 --> 02:59:14.341]  It's just pancakes.
[02:59:14.341 --> 02:59:16.903]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:59:16.903 --> 02:59:19.024]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:59:19.024 --> 02:59:21.846]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punish.
[02:59:21.846 --> 02:59:23.067]  You're lying to the public.
[02:59:23.067 --> 02:59:24.088]  It's disgusting.
[02:59:24.088 --> 02:59:26.190]  The media continues to misrepresent
[02:59:26.730 --> 02:59:27.490]  What I've said.
[02:59:27.490 --> 02:59:30.432]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:30.432 --> 02:59:34.393]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[02:59:34.393 --> 02:59:36.374]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[02:59:36.374 --> 02:59:38.495]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:59:38.495 --> 02:59:42.817]  We're gonna get fired up about the real things!
[02:59:42.817 --> 02:59:44.097]  The things that matter!
[02:59:51.286 --> 03:00:04.676]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:04.676 --> 03:00:05.837]  Spring in Missouri.
[03:00:05.837 --> 03:00:07.158]  Thank you for calling in today.
[03:00:07.158 --> 03:00:08.159]  Great to have you with us.
[03:00:08.159 --> 03:00:08.539]  Go ahead.
[03:00:08.539 --> 03:00:11.321]  How you doing Alex?
[03:00:11.321 --> 03:00:16.104]  I just want to say also, you know, I really got mad when I saw your court cases on TV.
[03:00:16.104 --> 03:00:17.966]  It was really, it really aggravated me.
[03:00:17.966 --> 03:00:19.487]  So I started getting stuff from you.
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:21.601]  Um, keep doing what you're doing.
[03:00:21.601 --> 03:00:29.265]  But you know, everybody's always talking about why indict Trump, you know, he's going to surely win and all this stuff, even though they cheated the last election.
[03:00:29.265 --> 03:00:37.929]  But what I was wondering is, is it a chance, is it a possibility they might want to try to assassinate him either as he's going?
[03:00:37.929 --> 03:00:39.330]  Your phone's over modulating.
[03:00:39.330 --> 03:00:41.631]  I'm really, I heard the first part of what you're saying.
[03:00:41.631 --> 03:00:44.232]  Just back off a little bit.
[03:00:44.232 --> 03:00:45.013]  Okay.
[03:00:45.013 --> 03:00:46.573]  I'm going to take it off the speaker.
[03:00:46.573 --> 03:00:47.634]  Hold on.
[03:00:48.604 --> 03:00:50.725]  Okay, can you hear me better now?
[03:00:50.725 --> 03:00:52.967]  Yeah, as a rule, let's not do talk radio on speaker.
[03:00:52.967 --> 03:00:54.728]  Go ahead.
[03:00:54.728 --> 03:00:56.329]  I'm trying to take it off.
[03:00:56.329 --> 03:00:57.530]  It's okay, go ahead.
[03:00:57.530 --> 03:01:10.598]  Anyway, okay, so I was just wondering, is there a possibility that maybe the reason they want to do this indictment is to actually assassinate him on the way to the jail or whatever or on the way back?
[03:01:10.598 --> 03:01:13.480]  Yeah, they could bite Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:17.323]  That's why the Secret Service is saying they're going to stay with him even if he's in jail.
[03:01:17.323 --> 03:01:17.763]  I mean, look.
[03:01:18.853 --> 03:01:30.764]  When they're just driving him to the jail, if at that point with all the protesters, let's say protesters will be out there, there might be a lot of people out there, that would be a time that they could take advantage of.
[03:01:30.764 --> 03:01:32.445]  No, I mean, I think that's a great point.
[03:01:32.445 --> 03:01:35.528]  I think anything's possible.
[03:01:35.528 --> 03:01:40.793]  And then I also wanted to ask you real quick, that one guy was talking about petitioning the court.
[03:01:40.793 --> 03:01:45.477]  Didn't some of the court cases for the 2020 election petition the court and they still got denied?
[03:01:47.759 --> 03:01:53.043]  I think he was generally talking about petitions for recalls of politicians.
[03:01:53.043 --> 03:01:53.803]  Okay.
[03:01:53.803 --> 03:02:02.449]  Because I wondered if we could just, if some lawyer would start like a class action lawsuit against, they keep saying it's a big lie.
[03:02:02.449 --> 03:02:05.211]  Well, let's have you prove that it's a big lie.
[03:02:05.211 --> 03:02:08.613]  Would we be able to produce evidence in a court of law?
[03:02:08.613 --> 03:02:10.374]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[03:02:10.374 --> 03:02:13.917]  We know they had a bunch of people vote for dead folks.
[03:02:13.917 --> 03:02:15.638]  The machine stuff hasn't really been proven.
[03:02:15.638 --> 03:02:16.699]  It's happened in past elections.
[03:02:17.489 --> 03:02:19.190]  Hi Alex, thanks for having Barnes on.
[03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:20.732]  Thanks for all your great callers.
[03:02:42.509 --> 03:02:45.570]  By the way, boss, 27 years listener of you.
[03:02:45.570 --> 03:02:46.530]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:46.530 --> 03:02:47.731]  Love you, brother.
[03:02:47.731 --> 03:02:48.051]  All right.
[03:02:48.051 --> 03:02:51.192]  Well, man, oh, man, I tell you, here we go again.
[03:02:51.192 --> 03:02:57.714]  Another attack, you know, by the hating Marxist Democrats and leftist lawyers.
[03:02:57.714 --> 03:02:59.894]  They're just they're insane.
[03:02:59.894 --> 03:03:06.556]  Anyhow, you know, I'm kind of wondering, I voted twice for Trump now and and we got the up and coming campaigns coming.
[03:03:06.556 --> 03:03:11.558]  And with that being said, I hope this time, Alex, that Trump
[03:03:12.259 --> 03:03:32.455]  If he got to be really loaded with some just absolute facts, truth, proof to be able to drop bombshell after bombshell, that he and his non-backing, stabbing swampers, whoever they may be, can get their minds blown in the mainstream media.
[03:03:32.455 --> 03:03:33.896]  In other words, that
[03:03:34.821 --> 03:03:39.022]  That his backers have got his back this time for sure.
[03:03:39.022 --> 03:03:44.663]  Oh, I think, I think, no doubt Trump's set on the ball, bring down the New World Order, I'll bring down the Deep State.
[03:03:44.663 --> 03:03:48.344]  There is no doubt Trump gets back in, he's going to war with these people.
[03:03:48.344 --> 03:04:00.047]  I'm just wondering, I mean, I wonder if him and his crew, everybody that's backing him, I just wonder, Alex, if they've really got something under their table secretly that's never been leaked out.
[03:04:01.085 --> 03:04:05.271]  And he's got something big that we just don't know about yet.
[03:04:05.271 --> 03:04:06.312]  Well, I know this.
[03:04:06.312 --> 03:04:08.755]  If they got it, they should release it now.
[03:04:08.755 --> 03:04:11.959]  We need to fire our political torpedoes of truth now.
[03:04:11.959 --> 03:04:13.601]  No one should sit on anything.
[03:04:13.601 --> 03:04:15.584]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:15.584 --> 03:04:17.886]  All right.
[03:04:17.886 --> 03:04:19.529]  Royce White is set to take over.
[03:04:20.834 --> 03:04:22.595]  I just did his show last week.
[03:04:22.595 --> 03:04:25.816]  I promise to get to every caller, so I'll come back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:25.816 --> 03:04:32.440]  I'm going to give Mike and Marilyn a minute and a half, and I'm going to introduce the great Royce White, who's kicking ass on the other side.
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:38.563]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Vandop Video, and then I'm going to drive up to Dallas tonight.
[03:04:38.563 --> 03:04:40.064]  I'll be co-hosting with
[03:04:42.443 --> 03:04:47.952]  Steven Crowder, Tuesday and Wednesday kicking off his new show for millions of viewers.
[03:04:47.952 --> 03:04:50.836]  And I'll be hosting my show from Dallas.
[03:04:50.836 --> 03:04:51.477]  So look for that.
[03:04:51.477 --> 03:04:55.243]  But in one hour, Owen Schroeder takes over at 3 p.m.
[03:04:55.243 --> 03:04:55.624]  Central.
[03:04:55.624 --> 03:04:55.964]  Stay with us.
[03:04:58.404 --> 03:05:06.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars has proven itself in the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[03:05:06.850 --> 03:05:12.294]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.
[03:05:12.294 --> 03:05:16.658]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners who have supported us over the years by spreading the word.
[03:05:17.278 --> 03:05:19.399]  I'm praying for the broadcast and buying product.
[03:05:19.399 --> 03:05:36.483]  But I really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence and never actually gone to Infowarshore.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements and survival gear that's there that won't just empower you and enrich your life but again will keep this broadcast transmitting.
[03:05:36.483 --> 03:05:40.384]  So whether it's Real Red Pill Plus or our super high quality CBD oil or the 50% off
[03:05:41.184 --> 03:05:41.864]  We're good to go.
[03:06:15.436 --> 03:06:18.218]  All right, we're into hour number four.
[03:06:18.218 --> 03:06:25.904]  The great Royce White, former NBA player, MMA fighter, constitutional congressional candidate who just gets better and better.
[03:06:25.904 --> 03:06:27.366]  He's a great talk show host.
[03:06:27.366 --> 03:06:28.907]  He was about to take over his show last week.
[03:06:28.907 --> 03:06:30.128]  It was amazing.
[03:06:30.128 --> 03:06:32.270]  But I promise to get every caller on the board.
[03:06:32.270 --> 03:06:36.153]  The last one here of the calls we took, we have unlimited great callers.
[03:06:36.153 --> 03:06:37.334]  I could take 50 hours of calls.
[03:06:37.334 --> 03:06:39.035]  Maybe we should do a show like that.
[03:06:39.035 --> 03:06:43.499]  But Mike, you're the last caller on the board from Maryland on the Trump indictment that they say is happening tomorrow.
[03:06:43.499 --> 03:06:43.739]  Go ahead.
[03:06:45.134 --> 03:06:47.555]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:06:47.555 --> 03:06:50.296]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[03:06:50.296 --> 03:06:53.597]  So I've been thinking about this Trump indictment.
[03:06:53.597 --> 03:06:58.478]  I think the timing is highly suspicious.
[03:06:58.478 --> 03:07:08.381]  I believe a Trump indictment and arrest could be a false flag that the deep state needs to blame a collapsing banking system on.
[03:07:08.381 --> 03:07:12.022]  If they can get enough people to write it,
[03:07:13.260 --> 03:07:14.480]  I totally agree with you.
[03:07:14.480 --> 03:07:18.981]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's definitely something in their playbook.
[03:07:18.981 --> 03:07:22.662]  Because it's a very reckless thing to do, never been done in U.S.
[03:07:22.662 --> 03:07:24.382]  history before.
[03:07:24.382 --> 03:07:28.743]  So the fact they're getting ready to do it, I think all options are on the table for the enemy.
[03:07:42.828 --> 03:07:43.330]  I agree.
[03:07:43.330 --> 03:07:49.331]  I think the best thing Trump supporters could do would be to not take the bait and stay at home.
[03:07:51.564 --> 03:08:09.651]  Well, you know, I don't want to get in the game and tell people to not go protest, and I get you're not saying that, you're saying that's your opinion, and I respect your opinion, but I wouldn't go to D.C., I wouldn't go to areas like New York, but I would have like church events and demonstrations in front of capitals, and then put it out over the internet to show we don't support it.
[03:08:09.651 --> 03:08:20.256]  If people think going out and protesting is important, more important is the backdrop of a capital and a bunch of people protesting, so then millions or hundreds of thousands conservatively watch it, and then we win.
[03:08:21.216 --> 03:08:23.177]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[03:08:23.177 --> 03:08:26.138]  Well, we're about to get Royce White's take on all this.
[03:08:26.138 --> 03:08:31.761]  RoyceWhite.substack.com, RoyceWhite.us and on Twitter, Highway underscore 30.
[03:08:31.761 --> 03:08:38.284]  Royce White is our guest host taking over right now and it's great to have him here with us.
[03:08:38.284 --> 03:08:38.964]  Royce, take it away.
[03:08:41.263 --> 03:08:41.823]  Thanks Alex.
[03:08:41.823 --> 03:08:43.404]  I appreciate the time once again.
[03:08:43.404 --> 03:08:46.565]  Thank you to the entire InfoWars team.
[03:08:46.565 --> 03:08:49.106]  Thank you to the entire InfoWars audience for having me.
[03:08:49.106 --> 03:08:58.729]  I can't tell you how much I get feedback on a daily basis that people were first introducing me on this show here and I really appreciate that.
[03:08:58.729 --> 03:09:02.110]  Tonight my podcast will air again at 9 p.m.
[03:09:02.110 --> 03:09:09.493]  Central on YouTube and we really like premiering on YouTube and we love having figures like Alex Jones on YouTube.
[03:09:10.093 --> 03:09:14.296]  I remember the day that they banned Alex Jones from YouTube.
[03:09:14.296 --> 03:09:27.586]  It was a dark day, but it was a day that I remember clear, and I told myself if I ever had the opportunity to have a podcast and interview Alex Jones, then we would bring him back on YouTube as much as we can, and we look forward to having him again in the future.
[03:09:27.586 --> 03:09:37.113]  Tonight's episode on the podcast will cover much of what I'm going to cover here today, and that is the wild, wildly
[03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:56.770]  Tyrannical Trump indictment and you know here's what we have to consider and and you know I go deep in my podcast I go go all the way to the root and I talk about the human condition and I talk about what led us here and the trajectory of history and the entire deal so if you get a chance tune in tonight at 9 p.m.
[03:09:56.770 --> 03:10:04.494]  on on YouTube please call me crazy but I'm gonna say it here again because I think this is one of the most spiritually alive audiences in the world
[03:10:08.390 --> 03:10:12.214]  And this is a completely spiritual matter.
[03:10:12.214 --> 03:10:15.416]  And yes, you know, the entire war is spiritual.
[03:10:15.416 --> 03:10:17.678]  It's all spiritual warfare, you could say, at a level.
[03:10:17.678 --> 03:10:21.642]  But this is a spiritual matter in a different sense.
[03:10:21.642 --> 03:10:33.271]  This is the neocon neoliberal order or the normalcy that has grown out of a post-enlightenment technological world.
[03:10:36.130 --> 03:10:43.175]  Getting people to voluntarily surrender their rights and their freedom for two prominent things, security and materialism.
[03:10:43.175 --> 03:10:47.297]  And I probably, you know, if you've heard me on the show before, you've heard me stress that.
[03:10:47.297 --> 03:10:58.845]  But we really have to stress it here today with this Donald Trump news coming down, because effectively what the federal government is saying is we're too big to be held accountable.
[03:10:58.845 --> 03:10:59.445]  We're too big.
[03:10:59.445 --> 03:11:00.346]  We're too powerful.
[03:11:00.346 --> 03:11:05.349]  Our scope, the reach of our governance is too much for you to resist.
[03:11:06.258 --> 03:11:12.002]  And what's scary, what's most worrisome, is that in many ways they're correct.
[03:11:12.002 --> 03:11:24.312]  Because in many ways, on both sides of the aisle, we've had this concession of freedom for security and materialism.
[03:11:24.312 --> 03:11:33.138]  And right now, what's being waged against Donald Trump, and what's being waged against all American citizens, is the rule of law.
[03:11:33.138 --> 03:11:35.140]  They're going to use the rule of law
[03:11:36.227 --> 03:11:44.290]  Uh, to tell the story that no, no one man is bigger than the law, even the president of the United States, even a former president.
[03:11:44.290 --> 03:11:46.791]  And we all just saw this day coming.
[03:11:46.791 --> 03:11:48.611]  Alex Jones certainly saw this day coming.
[03:11:48.611 --> 03:11:50.532]  That's why many of you tune in and listen to him.
[03:11:50.532 --> 03:11:55.494]  But for all those out there that still continue to say that he's crazy and whatnot,
[03:11:57.578 --> 03:12:12.104]  I mean, you can tell yourself that they're going after Donald Trump because Donald Trump is, you know, a jerk, or Donald Trump is a racist, or Donald Trump is a white nationalist, or is a conspiracy theorist, or whatever you want to say.
[03:12:12.104 --> 03:12:14.345]  You can tell yourself that story.
[03:12:14.345 --> 03:12:20.407]  But the reality is the apparatus is swinging around, they're swinging the cannons around, and they're aiming them right at you.
[03:12:20.407 --> 03:12:22.768]  And Donald Trump is just an example.
[03:12:22.768 --> 03:12:26.250]  He's an example of one of the most energetic grassroots movements
[03:12:27.034 --> 03:12:38.256]  In recent political history, maybe in political history, all of political history, all of American history, one of the most energetic grassroots movements that we have.
[03:12:38.256 --> 03:12:42.557]  And if they can take him out, what they're saying is your movements don't matter.
[03:12:42.557 --> 03:12:44.257]  Your movements don't matter.
[03:12:44.257 --> 03:12:47.298]  You're not really willing to die for what you believe in.
[03:12:47.298 --> 03:12:53.139]  You're not really ready to even fight for what you believe in, let alone sacrifice any huge part of your daily life.
[03:12:55.701 --> 03:12:58.983]  And that is a testament of where American citizenship is today.
[03:12:58.983 --> 03:13:07.106]  It's a testament of where the corruption of the establishment and the status quo is, but it's also a reflection of where the citizens are today.
[03:13:07.106 --> 03:13:19.652]  And I just continue to hearken to the citizens that we have to, we have to decide here and now, whether it's this Donald Trump situation, whether it's this banking collapse in the Federal Reserve with these
[03:13:20.490 --> 03:13:31.393]  Liquidity swaps and basically bailing out the entire world banking system or the western banking system or the trilateral banking system on the back of the American taxpayer.
[03:13:31.393 --> 03:13:33.334]  We have to decide right here.
[03:13:33.334 --> 03:13:36.374]  COVID, shot, the list goes on.
[03:13:36.374 --> 03:13:39.415]  We have to decide right here, right now.
[03:13:39.415 --> 03:13:41.016]  What are we willing to tolerate?
[03:13:41.016 --> 03:13:44.457]  What does American citizenship really mean to us?
[03:13:44.457 --> 03:13:45.577]  What does it mean to us?
[03:13:45.577 --> 03:13:46.777]  What is it served as?
[03:13:46.777 --> 03:13:48.178]  What will it mean in the future?
[03:13:50.243 --> 03:13:58.885]  What what can and will we do to save this nation and to save ourselves in the process?
[03:13:58.885 --> 03:14:05.807]  And you know, I just I can't even believe, you know, I was on Whitlock today and you can tune in to Jason Whitlock at 6 p.m.
[03:14:05.807 --> 03:14:07.707]  Central on YouTube as well.
[03:14:07.707 --> 03:14:10.788]  And we went over this exact topic there as well.
[03:14:10.788 --> 03:14:14.249]  This is one of the darkest days in this Republic's history.
[03:14:14.249 --> 03:14:15.309]  Even the proposition
[03:14:15.959 --> 03:14:23.362]  That a former president would be arrested and targeted by his political opponents for being a dissident.
[03:14:23.362 --> 03:14:28.264]  And make no mistake about it, regardless of how you feel about Donald Trump, in many ways, he's a dissident.
[03:14:28.737 --> 03:14:36.499]  Okay, anytime you dissent against the prevailing status quo narrative on as many different issues as he has, you're a dissident.
[03:14:36.499 --> 03:14:39.180]  I don't care if you agree with his level of dissidence.
[03:14:39.180 --> 03:14:42.001]  I don't care if you are in alignment on key issues.
[03:14:42.001 --> 03:14:42.901]  Doesn't matter.
[03:14:42.901 --> 03:14:45.221]  The point is dissidents are being targeted.
[03:14:45.221 --> 03:14:49.923]  When that happens, when that happens, we no longer live in a republic.
[03:14:49.923 --> 03:14:51.203]  These are kangaroo courts.
[03:14:51.203 --> 03:14:53.364]  These are, these are weaponized courts.
[03:14:55.330 --> 03:14:58.153]  And what makes it even worse is they insult your intelligence.
[03:14:58.153 --> 03:15:09.483]  They tell you that it's about his taxes, or it's about, you know, having sex with Stormy Daniels, or him paying off all of the... I mean, how stupid do you have to be?
[03:15:09.483 --> 03:15:11.965]  How dumb do you have to be to even believe something like that?
[03:15:11.965 --> 03:15:14.447]  Of course it has nothing to do with those things.
[03:15:14.447 --> 03:15:15.868]  Of course it has nothing to do with those.
[03:15:15.868 --> 03:15:17.530]  This isn't about his taxes.
[03:15:18.266 --> 03:15:19.027]  They're all running it.
[03:15:19.027 --> 03:15:21.850]  The entire system is run on tax loopholes.
[03:15:21.850 --> 03:15:22.831]  We all know it.
[03:15:22.831 --> 03:15:23.491]  It's ridiculous.
[03:15:23.491 --> 03:15:31.760]  Anybody who even forwards the notion that it's about taxes is completely and utterly out of their mind or they're 100% in on the scam.
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:33.601]  This isn't about sexual improprieties.
[03:15:33.601 --> 03:15:35.103]  That's ridiculous.
[03:15:35.103 --> 03:15:38.947]  Sexual impropriety is the backbone of this entire culture.
[03:15:40.234 --> 03:15:50.625]  Okay, it's been the backbone of American culture for a long time, but it's definitely the backbone of the 21st century and the social media or a big technocracy culture.
[03:15:50.625 --> 03:15:53.668]  I can't go on Instagram without seeing a naked girl's butt.
[03:15:53.668 --> 03:15:54.309]  I mean, this is absurd.
[03:15:58.462 --> 03:16:15.874]  One thing the New York Times got wrong, amongst almost everything else they got wrong, and their big hit piece has been put all over every newspaper I've seen and since it's everywhere, putting in the local statesman, is that we're booming here and that we've just rivers of money and rivers of gold and rivers of diamonds.
[03:16:15.874 --> 03:16:16.655]  None of that's true.
[03:16:17.535 --> 03:16:27.041]  It's kind of apropos that Infowars is barely paying the bills, so they're wanting all this money that doesn't exist, but we don't want to be too good at that and have zero money.
[03:16:27.041 --> 03:16:31.384]  In fact, I'd like to have plenty of money to fight the appeals and move forward.
[03:16:31.384 --> 03:16:37.668]  There's been big rulings in Texas and federally, and almost every mainline analyst, including at the AP, says that they're
[03:16:38.408 --> 03:16:39.790]  We're good to go.
[03:16:54.830 --> 03:16:57.412]  But Lister's then thought, oh my God, you are going under.
[03:16:57.412 --> 03:16:59.093]  And that almost created what they wanted.
[03:16:59.093 --> 03:17:03.055]  Massive support was withdrawn six, eight months ago when the bankruptcies began.
[03:17:03.055 --> 03:17:04.776]  People really thought we were going to be closing.
[03:17:04.776 --> 03:17:08.798]  No, it's Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, which is a reorganization.
[03:17:08.798 --> 03:17:11.240]  So I want to just make that announcement to Lister's again.
[03:17:12.060 --> 03:17:12.300]  This is
[03:17:30.791 --> 03:17:37.539]  So that any profits are put into a settlement trust in the future on the appeals that are three to four years and almost every expert agrees they will lose.
[03:17:37.539 --> 03:17:44.188]  I don't want to talk about us personally anymore, but I get the questions all the time in text messages and on the street and you know the crew ask me all the time.
[03:17:44.188 --> 03:17:45.690]  Any other points you want to add on that, Barnes?
[03:17:45.690 --> 03:17:48.053]  We'll go to calls, start the next hour, get all the other news.
[03:17:49.378 --> 03:17:50.558]  Just that the key is the audience.
[03:17:50.558 --> 03:17:52.459]  The whole goal was to separate the audience.
[03:17:52.459 --> 03:17:57.821]  The same way that the Trump indictment is trying to separate Trump from his audience, from his base, from his supporters.
[03:17:57.821 --> 03:18:04.123]  The goal of the lawfare against Alex Jones at Infowars was all about stopping the audience from having its voice heard.
[03:18:04.543 --> 03:18:09.889]  Through Alex Jones, through InfoWars, through sharing the links, through continuing to support it.
[03:18:09.889 --> 03:18:14.194]  That's what they explicitly said in the Connecticut press conference right after the Connecticut verdict.
[03:18:14.194 --> 03:18:19.900]  They made an explicit and express call, please InfoWars supporters, stop supporting InfoWars.
[03:18:20.300 --> 03:18:38.995]  So if you want to continue to get back at protecting the First Amendment and continue to support independent populist information that was ahead of the curve on almost everything, whether it was global war, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was Epstein, whether it was any of these scandals, whether it was the Biden family, whether it was Biden's bad health.
[03:18:39.315 --> 03:18:40.415]  There's a reason people forget.
[03:18:40.415 --> 03:18:42.036]  That's why they kicked off of Instagram.
[03:18:42.036 --> 03:18:48.958]  You exposed Biden's first one to expose Biden's serious health problems, which now are a constant meme and source of comedy.
[03:18:48.958 --> 03:18:53.760]  The best way to do that is to continue to support InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:54.580 --> 03:18:57.021]  And I speak from personal lived experience.
[03:18:57.021 --> 03:18:59.322]  I've been a supporter for the better part of a decade.
[03:18:59.322 --> 03:19:03.424]  I continue to, mostly because it's great products at a great price.
[03:19:03.424 --> 03:19:10.908]  But I love supporting something that keeps free populist information on the air out to the American people.
[03:19:10.908 --> 03:19:13.149]  This is a perspective you don't get anywhere else.
[03:19:13.149 --> 03:19:20.192]  If you want to keep it, if you want to keep the First Amendment, if you want to keep this voice on the air, continue to support InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:20.812 --> 03:19:32.236]  Find something you like, that you need anyway, at an affordable, accessible price, and get back at the Deep State, because this is still the best public tool against the Deep State that exists.
[03:19:32.236 --> 03:19:35.096]  That's the reason why it was such a target for the last half decade.
[03:19:35.096 --> 03:19:49.441]  And there's nobody that does that better than the InfoWars audience, and they do it better by continuing to support InfoWars, keeping it on the air despite all the assaults and attacks, all the lies, and all the libels, by going to InfoWarsStore.com and finding things they support.
[03:19:57.805 --> 03:20:02.426]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.426 --> 03:20:12.689]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:12.689 --> 03:20:14.250]  Welcome back.
[03:20:14.250 --> 03:20:15.430]  Welcome back.
[03:20:15.430 --> 03:20:16.450]  My name is Royce White.
[03:20:16.450 --> 03:20:17.991]  I'm your guest host for the hour.
[03:20:17.991 --> 03:20:22.172]  I am here in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the belly of the beast at Free People Radio.
[03:20:22.927 --> 03:20:27.390]  Please, please tune in tonight to my podcast, airing at 9 p.m.
[03:20:27.390 --> 03:20:28.590]  Central on YouTube.
[03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:30.411]  That's Please Call Me Crazy on YouTube.
[03:20:30.411 --> 03:20:36.374]  If you haven't already, go back and check out the great Alex Jones, who we interviewed last Friday.
[03:20:36.374 --> 03:20:39.596]  And it was epic, to say the least, legendary, a true honor.
[03:20:39.596 --> 03:20:46.420]  And I'm honored to be back here at InfoWars, hosting during this most historic time.
[03:20:46.420 --> 03:20:51.723]  In that interview, I talked a little bit about this document, the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[03:20:52.714 --> 03:21:08.761]  And in this document, it basically lays out all the reasons why they should be able to take your rights and that terrorism, the apparatus that was formerly aimed at radical Islam is now aimed directly at you all.
[03:21:08.761 --> 03:21:13.462]  And when I say you all, I mean specifically Christians, white men,
[03:21:15.658 --> 03:21:19.380]  Vaccine deniers, election integrity deniers, and the list goes on.
[03:21:19.380 --> 03:21:20.500]  But really, any dissident.
[03:21:20.500 --> 03:21:40.028]  And now, you know, in the culminating act, in the climax of this document, or this domestic terrorism, they go after a former president who, by many people's standards, if you venture to question the integrity of the 2020 election, is in fact the sitting president.
[03:21:40.783 --> 03:21:52.514]  Now, I won't make any definitive claims about the overall election, the integrity of the election, although I think our elections have had a lack of integrity for a long time on many fronts.
[03:21:52.514 --> 03:22:03.124]  Most importantly, I think, campaign finance and the infinite supply of contribution from the liberal mainstream
[03:22:03.900 --> 03:22:05.881]  Media industrial complex.
[03:22:05.881 --> 03:22:11.705]  That would be the biggest example of campaign finance violation in my opinion.
[03:22:11.705 --> 03:22:15.608]  But regardless, I mean, you know, this is the culminating event.
[03:22:15.608 --> 03:22:22.372]  This is the culminating act to go after the figurehead of one of the most energetic political movements in American history.
[03:22:22.372 --> 03:22:26.014]  And whether you like Donald Trump or not, it's not the point.
[03:22:26.014 --> 03:22:27.895]  It's just not the point.
[03:22:27.895 --> 03:22:28.596]  The point is,
[03:22:29.602 --> 03:22:37.006]  That conservatives, Christians, Republicans all across this country have been cold is what they've been.
[03:22:37.006 --> 03:22:39.587]  They've been shepherded into a shooting gallery.
[03:22:39.587 --> 03:22:42.669]  They sit right over a target and X marks the spot.
[03:22:42.669 --> 03:22:50.352]  And in the same place where they have abnegated their freedom for security, because that's more of a conservative Republican Christian motif.
[03:22:52.970 --> 03:22:54.211]  501c3 Christians at that.
[03:22:54.211 --> 03:22:57.674]  You know, it's, it's, oh, we want more police.
[03:22:57.674 --> 03:23:01.538]  You know, we want a stronger military, right?
[03:23:01.538 --> 03:23:12.107]  We want, we want funding for federal agencies, federal intelligence community, governing agencies like the FBI and the CIA and the NSA and so on and so forth.
[03:23:12.107 --> 03:23:13.549]  Everybody was having a ball.
[03:23:14.372 --> 03:23:33.720]  When the NSA was preaching that they needed funding to surveil radical Islamic terrorists in the hills of Afghanistan or some other third-world shithole in order to keep you safe, everybody clapped and we cheered and we said, America's a guns-blazing cowboy western country that can't be defeated.
[03:23:33.720 --> 03:23:36.441]  We know how to do war.
[03:23:36.441 --> 03:23:41.123]  Nobody stopped to think that eventually, eventually, domestic terrorism
[03:23:42.646 --> 03:23:51.956]  A strategy against domestic terrorism and those same legal institutions would be aimed right at the former president of the United States.
[03:23:51.956 --> 03:23:54.218]  Alex Jones saw it.
[03:23:54.218 --> 03:23:55.319]  Alex Jones saw it.
[03:23:55.319 --> 03:23:56.080]  Some others saw it.
[03:23:56.964 --> 03:24:01.787]  But they were a whistle in the wind, so to speak, in terms of the greater narrative.
[03:24:01.787 --> 03:24:02.868]  They were called crazy.
[03:24:02.868 --> 03:24:04.609]  They were called conspiracy theories.
[03:24:04.609 --> 03:24:06.310]  Oh, you're an alarmist.
[03:24:06.310 --> 03:24:07.330]  You're anti-government.
[03:24:07.330 --> 03:24:17.437]  In fact, it actually lays out that, aside from being a racist or a white supremacist, being anti-government is a qualification for domestic terrorism.
[03:24:18.692 --> 03:24:21.755]  The grandiosity of the federal government couldn't get any bigger.
[03:24:21.755 --> 03:24:29.663]  They're actually now saying that no matter how corrupt the government may be, if you're anti-government or anti-corruption, you're a terrorist.
[03:24:29.663 --> 03:24:38.111]  And in the same apparatus that they use to make you feel safe at night, to make you lay your head down and feel this warm sense of security.
[03:24:39.016 --> 03:24:46.563]  This warm sense of security that will enable you to carry on with your radical materialism on a daily basis.
[03:24:46.563 --> 03:24:49.426]  Now they're going to swing it right around at you.
[03:24:49.426 --> 03:24:51.628]  And the question remains.
[03:24:51.628 --> 03:24:57.894]  It's the question that we we've had to ask ourselves and a number of times in this country's history.
[03:24:57.894 --> 03:25:01.057]  A question that we've we've answered.
[03:25:02.893 --> 03:25:13.657]  With a lack of righteousness at a number of times in this country's history, a question that now hangs over all of us like the sword of Damocles, how far are we willing to let this federal government go?
[03:25:13.657 --> 03:25:16.738]  I mean, Alex is tied up in any number of court cases.
[03:25:16.738 --> 03:25:17.738]  Maybe he can't say it.
[03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:19.899]  Steve Bannon, he's tied up in a number of court cases.
[03:25:19.899 --> 03:25:21.499]  Maybe he can't say it.
[03:25:21.499 --> 03:25:22.920]  But I'm going to ask the question.
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:27.161]  As a young 30-year-old man, I absolutely think people should protest.
[03:25:27.964 --> 03:25:47.155]  And it's not because Donald Trump is being mistreated or treated unfairly or that this is unjust or that George Soros, you know, basically paid for the campaign of this district attorney, which is an example and a reflection of many district attorneys that he's put into power and finance campaign for us all across the country.
[03:25:47.155 --> 03:25:50.477]  I mean, we are living in occupied territory.
[03:25:50.477 --> 03:25:54.500]  I mean, when you let the people who are living, when you let the people who
[03:25:55.660 --> 03:26:04.787]  Our foreign occupiers financed the political administrations who put out documents on domestic terrorism.
[03:26:04.787 --> 03:26:07.629]  I would say the Republic is now dead.
[03:26:07.629 --> 03:26:09.970]  The question is, how do we get it back?
[03:26:09.970 --> 03:26:20.458]  And absolutely, there is a need for a revolution of Christian ministry and, last but certainly not least, Christian charity.
[03:26:21.351 --> 03:26:22.812]  And the two must go together.
[03:26:22.812 --> 03:26:25.933]  We need Christian ministry, and we need Christian charity.
[03:26:25.933 --> 03:26:27.633]  And we need it yesterday.
[03:26:27.633 --> 03:26:29.874]  And we need it to be a priority.
[03:26:29.874 --> 03:26:35.016]  And we need the demonstrations to be Christian-driven.
[03:26:35.016 --> 03:26:36.917]  Where are all the Christians?
[03:26:36.917 --> 03:26:37.717]  Where have we been?
[03:26:37.717 --> 03:26:47.901]  We've been in our churches, we've been in our, you know, in our homes, with our Bibles, in our little communities, in our Bible studies, and that's all great.
[03:26:47.901 --> 03:26:49.101]  Christian community is great.
[03:26:50.292 --> 03:26:52.033]  And believing in faith in the Word is great.
[03:26:52.033 --> 03:27:00.119]  But at some point, you know, I just I just see that one of the greatest sinful wars is that there are no righteous and divine wars.
[03:27:00.119 --> 03:27:15.510]  That all Christians should just abnegate their their they should resign from the world and and and only concern themselves with the metaphysical or the spiritual and let all the other chips fall where they will.
[03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:18.872]  I mean, yeah, okay, I guess.
[03:27:20.069 --> 03:27:30.213]  If that's the story you want to tell, I have a hard time believing that this country is as Christian as it claims to be.
[03:27:30.213 --> 03:27:35.395]  If that's the story we're going to tell, I have a hard time believing this country was ever as Christian as it claimed to be.
[03:27:35.395 --> 03:27:39.437]  And that's not a knock on Christianity, that's a knock on man taking the Lord's name in vain.
[03:27:39.437 --> 03:27:41.898]  What's happening now is we're getting our bluff called.
[03:27:41.898 --> 03:27:43.739]  As a sportsman, when I'm a fighter,
[03:27:50.282 --> 03:28:00.867]  And I pretend like I, you know, like my game is sharp in one area, and you get another fighter who's smart enough and skilled enough and experienced enough, they'll call your bluff.
[03:28:00.867 --> 03:28:04.849]  Same thing with a basketball game, same thing with football, same thing with any competitive sport.
[03:28:06.216 --> 03:28:09.017]  You can only present a false narrative.
[03:28:09.017 --> 03:28:14.939]  You can only present a false position too long until you run up against somebody with the balls to call your bluff.
[03:28:14.939 --> 03:28:24.441]  And right now, a bunch of tyrannical, anti-American, globalist, Satanists are calling Christians bluff.
[03:28:24.441 --> 03:28:27.582]  They're saying, how much do you really believe in freedom?
[03:28:27.582 --> 03:28:29.503]  How much do you really believe in America?
[03:28:29.503 --> 03:28:31.023]  How much do you really believe in God?
[03:28:31.764 --> 03:28:34.106]  How much do you really believe in your own righteous position?
[03:28:34.106 --> 03:28:36.267]  How much do you really believe in your own ideas?
[03:28:36.267 --> 03:28:37.768]  Show us!
[03:28:37.768 --> 03:28:38.189]  Show us!
[03:28:38.189 --> 03:28:45.073]  And we should rightfully be ready to live, fight, and die for that position.
[03:28:45.073 --> 03:28:46.234]  And that's my opinion on the matter.
[03:28:46.234 --> 03:28:48.196]  I'll see you on the other side of the brick.
[03:28:48.196 --> 03:28:53.920]  I am your host Royce White and you are watching InfoWars here from Minneapolis in the belly of the beast.

[03:29:57.529 --> 03:30:05.733]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:30:05.733 --> 03:30:07.194]  That is a hellish future.
[03:30:07.194 --> 03:30:16.598]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or info-restore.com.
[03:30:16.598 --> 03:30:22.201]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:30:22.201 --> 03:30:24.182]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.

[03:30:30.147 --> 03:30:34.090]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:30:34.090 --> 03:30:39.975]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:30:39.975 --> 03:30:42.057]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:30:42.857 --> 03:30:43.899]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:30:43.899 --> 03:30:54.272]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:30:54.272 --> 03:30:55.314]  This is an Infowar.
[03:30:55.314 --> 03:30:56.936]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:30:59.289 --> 03:31:05.693]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023, and the world is an insane place.
[03:31:05.693 --> 03:31:07.455]  World War III has already started.
[03:31:07.455 --> 03:31:09.776]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[03:31:09.776 --> 03:31:10.937]  There's mass censorship.
[03:31:10.937 --> 03:31:13.138]  James O'Keefe's been removed from Project Veritas.
[03:31:13.138 --> 03:31:15.400]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[03:31:15.400 --> 03:31:19.883]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[03:31:20.043 --> 03:31:23.986]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[03:31:23.986 --> 03:31:32.412]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and hit the broadcast on the air by getting great products at Infowarshore.com.

[03:32:02.397 --> 03:32:11.509]  But they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down Infowars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others.

[03:32:57.972 --> 03:33:03.878]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.499 --> 03:33:16.902]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:33:16.902 --> 03:33:26.129]  I'm your guest host, Royce White, and I am here at Free People Radio, right here at the news desk here for Please Call Me Crazy.
[03:33:26.129 --> 03:33:28.431]  My podcast will be airing tonight at 9 p.m.
[03:33:28.431 --> 03:33:28.851]  Central.
[03:33:28.851 --> 03:33:38.679]  Make sure you go check that out and also make sure that you go and watch the replay or the episode of myself and the great Alex Jones from last Friday.
[03:33:39.644 --> 03:33:45.407]  It was an incredible interview, a legendary interview, and I'm very thankful and honored to be able to have Alex Jones on my podcast.
[03:33:45.407 --> 03:34:05.439]  It's a dream come true, really, and to be able to host here on InfoWars and, you know, it's a double-edged sword because obviously it's a great honor and privilege to be able to host on a platform that's spoken truth to power for so long, but at the same time, I'm conflicted because
[03:34:06.745 --> 03:34:14.050]  I'm able to do so at a time when all the things that Alex Jones predicted, or many of the things that Alex Jones predicted, come true.
[03:34:14.050 --> 03:34:18.794]  And them coming true is a testament of failure from us.
[03:34:18.794 --> 03:34:28.401]  From all of us who didn't heed the warning, or who didn't embrace the warning enough to catalyze that political action.
[03:34:28.401 --> 03:34:33.165]  I'm new to this conservative movement, let's call it.
[03:34:34.438 --> 03:34:35.879]  I was born and raised a Christian.
[03:34:35.879 --> 03:34:38.219]  I was baptized a Christian, a Catholic.
[03:34:38.219 --> 03:34:45.322]  I know many people out there have their issues with Catholics, but now the domestic terrorists say that Catholics are the most dangerous people in the country.
[03:34:45.322 --> 03:34:46.722]  So that tells you something as well.
[03:34:46.722 --> 03:34:56.445]  Donald Trump, Catholics, Steve Bannon, Alex Jones, Royce White, you know, all those who said that Paul Pelosi may have been having an extramarital gay affair.
[03:34:56.445 --> 03:34:59.226]  We're the most dangerous people in the country.
[03:34:59.226 --> 03:35:02.087]  So, you know, I was raised up in the church.
[03:35:02.087 --> 03:35:03.608]  I was raised up as a Christian.
[03:35:04.940 --> 03:35:10.522]  And it bothers me the lukewarm nature of our Christian communities all across the country.
[03:35:10.522 --> 03:35:12.242]  I know you may not like to hear that.
[03:35:12.242 --> 03:35:13.062]  I get it.
[03:35:13.062 --> 03:35:13.442]  I get it.
[03:35:13.442 --> 03:35:16.063]  Nobody wants to hold the mirror up to themselves.
[03:35:16.063 --> 03:35:31.907]  And we all want to sit around all day and complain and talk for hours and hours on end and text message each other in group chats and, you know, harp on about the latest headline from any number of one of these bad actors, you know, any one of these policies, any one of these
[03:35:33.047 --> 03:35:39.431]  People who intend to take your freedoms.
[03:35:39.431 --> 03:35:44.655]  But the real, again, I say the real question is, you know, we're so lukewarm.
[03:35:44.655 --> 03:35:47.957]  I mean, we really are lukewarm.
[03:35:47.957 --> 03:35:50.139]  It really boils down to it.
[03:35:50.139 --> 03:35:51.500]  So many of us are lukewarm.
[03:35:51.500 --> 03:35:56.023]  I can't tell you in the first couple of weeks of my podcast, I use profanity a lot and people
[03:35:56.681 --> 03:36:03.788]  People, um, you know, messaging and calling and Christians or, you know, don't let anything foul come out of your mouth.
[03:36:03.788 --> 03:36:10.113]  It says that the Bible chapter, verse blah, blah, blah.
[03:36:10.113 --> 03:36:17.360]  Uh, the foul, the foul that comes out of people's mouths, biblically speaking, was talking about lies and deceit.
[03:36:17.970 --> 03:36:20.571]  I wasn't talking about the use of language, profanity.
[03:36:20.571 --> 03:36:23.011]  I was talking about the intent, the will.
[03:36:23.011 --> 03:36:28.112]  And when you say things like that, you really show a lack of biblical and theological understanding.
[03:36:28.112 --> 03:36:33.694]  Certainly spiritual intelligence or spiritual wisdom and discernment.
[03:36:33.694 --> 03:36:39.595]  Because sin is a matter of the will first and your actions secondarily.
[03:36:39.595 --> 03:36:46.317]  And this is a way where our American culture or Western culture has been taken over by this sort of Judeo-Buddhist
[03:36:48.274 --> 03:36:51.295]  Mentalities, Judeo-Buddhist worldview.
[03:36:51.295 --> 03:37:05.179]  And I say Judeo-Buddhist because they kind of co-opted all of the tenets, the foundational tenets of traditional Judaism and Christianity, but they've slapped a Buddhist marketing promotion over top of it.
[03:37:06.360 --> 03:37:22.028]  And they've done that for a specific reason because the Buddhist philosophy is one that says that your daily practice, your actions on a daily basis are the predicate for your existence, are the predicate for your spiritual health and your being.
[03:37:22.028 --> 03:37:26.410]  Christians don't believe that because we don't believe that this world is the only existence.
[03:37:26.410 --> 03:37:35.975]  We don't believe that this world is the only thing that's happening now or in perpetuity, into infinity, in the eternal.
[03:37:37.498 --> 03:37:40.941]  So it's not right for us to resign from society.
[03:37:40.941 --> 03:37:48.927]  It's not right for us to abnegate the fundamental will of sin.
[03:37:48.927 --> 03:38:03.719]  And I use that example and I go that deep to say, do you really think that it has more impact on your spiritual standing, your spiritual status, if you use profanity versus if you allow tyrants
[03:38:04.690 --> 03:38:18.381]  To rise up alongside you while you lace their pockets with your hard-earned dollars, with your hard-earned shekels and exhort tyrannical rule over the people while they promote child sacrifice.
[03:38:18.381 --> 03:38:23.004]  I mean, I'm sitting here with a packet here from our previous Christina Caramo interview.
[03:38:23.004 --> 03:38:28.208]  That was last Wednesday before the great Alex Jones and right here from Newsweek.
[03:38:30.224 --> 03:38:37.606]  Uh, Christina Karamo says that the child sacrifice is a very satanic practice and that's precisely what abortion is.
[03:38:37.606 --> 03:38:42.688]  And, and this document lays it out as a wild conspiracy theory.
[03:38:42.688 --> 03:38:44.988]  Uh, that, that is in support of Donald Trump.
[03:38:44.988 --> 03:38:48.589]  I mean, the whole predicate is laid out for you.
[03:38:48.589 --> 03:38:57.212]  So do we really have time to, to, um, play chaperone to the words that people choose to use?
[03:38:58.030 --> 03:39:09.477]  To pass judgment on fellow Christians about the profanity they choose to use to exalt the moment, to augment the moment in the severity and the urgency?
[03:39:09.477 --> 03:39:18.864]  Or is it that our own lukewarm Christianity across the span of time has ceded the ground for Satanism to take over?
[03:39:18.864 --> 03:39:25.628]  I mean, which one has more spiritual and moral culpability, I wonder?
[03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:28.041]  Maybe it's the 501.
[03:39:28.041 --> 03:39:31.062]  I've said it before on the show, but I'll say it here again.
[03:39:31.062 --> 03:39:33.344]  This isn't a Christian nation.
[03:39:33.344 --> 03:39:36.665]  This is a 501c3 Christian nation.
[03:39:36.665 --> 03:39:39.467]  And that's an important distinction to make.
[03:39:39.467 --> 03:39:40.927]  Pay unto Caesar.
[03:39:40.927 --> 03:39:42.788]  Render unto Caesar.
[03:39:42.788 --> 03:39:47.170]  It's not a scripture about individual taxation.
[03:39:47.170 --> 03:39:48.071]  It's a scripture about
[03:39:49.156 --> 03:40:13.097]  Religious institutions and spiritual institutions spiritual leaders spiritual guides not be keep being co-opted by the state Not being co-opted by the government and and there's a lot of 501c3 Christian institutions all across this great nation and when they sit back and they allow this nation to move towards a satanic practice and
[03:40:13.740 --> 03:40:20.784]  All around us, with no rebuke, with no refute, that is the symbol of foulness out of the mouth.
[03:40:20.784 --> 03:40:41.756]  When you go up to the pulpit, when you go up to and before the congregation, and you continue to preach the Word of God as though there is no greater political circumstance that one must consider around their institution, in their community, in their greater community, in the greater nation, that's taking the Lord's name in vain.
[03:40:41.756 --> 03:40:43.157]  I mean, let's get granular about it.
[03:40:43.951 --> 03:40:50.315]  I mean, let's just cut the bull.
[03:40:50.315 --> 03:40:55.198]  I can't cuss on Alex's show because he's on a lot of radio stations, so we can't cuss here.
[03:40:55.198 --> 03:40:57.959]  But on my podcast, I cuss nonstop.
[03:40:57.959 --> 03:41:02.522]  I'm going to continue to use profanity nonstop because I think people are jerk-offs.
[03:41:02.522 --> 03:41:03.482]  I'm just going to be honest.
[03:41:03.482 --> 03:41:04.623]  And it's not you in the audience.
[03:41:04.623 --> 03:41:06.164]  If it doesn't apply to you, it doesn't apply to you.
[03:41:06.164 --> 03:41:09.466]  But another thing is, when are we going to
[03:41:10.538 --> 03:41:16.720]  Drop everything and support leaders who are really willing to say what needs to be said.
[03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:18.960]  And you may not agree with everything Donald Trump has to say.
[03:41:18.960 --> 03:41:19.600]  I surely don't.
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:26.522]  But he certainly was willing to say a bit more, a bit more honestly, a bit more forthright than many of his counterparts.
[03:41:26.522 --> 03:41:28.843]  Nobody can deny that.
[03:41:28.843 --> 03:41:34.524]  And they try and hang him or they try to, they're now trying to string him up on a cross for it.
[03:41:34.524 --> 03:41:35.804]  And that's why they're going after him.
[03:41:35.804 --> 03:41:37.365]  It has nothing to do with taxes.
[03:41:37.365 --> 03:41:38.045]  Give me a break.
[03:41:39.085 --> 03:41:39.665]  Give me a break.
[03:41:39.665 --> 03:41:53.934]  The same sexual perverse pedophiles that want your kids to be able to talk about sex and not only sex, but transgender sex lifestyle at their schools without your consent.
[03:41:53.934 --> 03:42:04.641]  These people are concerned about the morals and ethics and values and righteousness or legitimacy of Donald Trump's sexual exploits.
[03:42:06.010 --> 03:42:10.312]  And any financial implications that are connected to it?
[03:42:10.312 --> 03:42:12.052]  The integrity of campaign finance?
[03:42:12.052 --> 03:42:13.733]  Are you kidding me?
[03:42:13.733 --> 03:42:15.453]  I ran against Ilhan Omar.
[03:42:15.453 --> 03:42:29.919]  All conventional wisdom say that she married her brother to get passage into this country, only to then divorce her brother and marry a guy who then became her campaign manager who gets $20,000 a month.
[03:42:33.832 --> 03:42:43.382]  In fact, the Democrats transferred exactly $20,000 a month from the DNC, from the Ohio DNC, to the Minnesota DNC, and then paid him.
[03:42:43.382 --> 03:42:45.024]  I mean, are we really going to talk about ethics?
[03:42:45.024 --> 03:42:47.246]  How long are we going to put up with this?
[03:42:47.246 --> 03:42:49.909]  How long are we going to tolerate this tyranny?
[03:42:49.909 --> 03:42:51.711]  Ask yourself.
[03:42:51.711 --> 03:42:52.732]  And I'll see you on the other side.
[03:42:52.732 --> 03:42:54.114]  My name is Royce White.
[03:42:54.114 --> 03:42:56.296]  This is the Family Feast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:42:58.798 --> 03:43:16.197]  One thing the New York Times got wrong, amongst almost everything else they got wrong, and their big hit piece that's been put all over every newspaper I've seen and it's everywhere, including in the local statesman, is that we're booming here and that we've just rivers of money and rivers of gold and rivers of diamonds.
[03:43:16.197 --> 03:43:16.978]  None of that's true.
[03:43:17.859 --> 03:43:27.364]  It's kind of apropos that Infowars is barely paying the bills, so they're wanting all this money that doesn't exist, but we don't want to be too good at that and have zero money.
[03:43:27.364 --> 03:43:31.726]  In fact, I'd like to have plenty of money to fight the appeals and move forward.
[03:43:31.726 --> 03:43:37.989]  There's been big rulings in Texas and federally, and almost every mainline analyst, including at the AP, says that they're
[03:43:38.689 --> 03:43:39.709]  We're good to go.
[03:43:55.154 --> 03:43:57.736]  But listeners then thought, oh my God, you are going under.
[03:43:57.736 --> 03:43:59.417]  And that almost created what they wanted.
[03:43:59.417 --> 03:44:03.379]  Massive support was withdrawn six, eight months ago when the bankruptcies began.
[03:44:03.379 --> 03:44:05.100]  People really thought we were going to be closing.
[03:44:05.100 --> 03:44:09.202]  No, it's Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, which is a reorganization.
[03:44:09.202 --> 03:44:11.584]  So I want to just make that announcement to listeners again.
[03:44:12.304 --> 03:44:12.364]  No.
[03:44:30.917 --> 03:44:37.865]  Uh, so that any profits are put into a settlement trust in the future on the appeals that are three to four years and almost every expert agrees they will lose.
[03:44:37.865 --> 03:44:44.512]  I don't want to talk about us personally anymore, but I get the questions all the time in text messages and on the street and you know the crew ask me all the time.
[03:44:44.512 --> 03:44:45.974]  Any other points you want to add on that, Barnes?
[03:44:45.974 --> 03:44:48.377]  We'll go to calls, start the next hour, get all the other news.
[03:44:49.702 --> 03:44:50.882]  Just that the key is the audience.
[03:44:50.882 --> 03:44:52.783]  The whole goal was to separate the audience.
[03:44:52.783 --> 03:44:58.145]  The same way that the Trump indictment is trying to separate Trump from his audience, from his base, from his supporters.
[03:44:58.145 --> 03:45:04.447]  The goal of the lawfare against Alex Jones at Infowars was all about stopping the audience from having its voice heard.
[03:45:04.867 --> 03:45:10.212]  Through Alex Jones, through InfoWars, through sharing the links, through continuing to support it.
[03:45:10.212 --> 03:45:14.516]  That's what they explicitly said in the Connecticut press conference right after the Connecticut verdict.
[03:45:14.516 --> 03:45:20.241]  They made an explicit and express call, please InfoWars supporters, stop supporting InfoWars.
[03:45:20.641 --> 03:45:39.652]  So if you want to continue to get back at protecting the First Amendment and continue to support independent populist information that was ahead of the curve on almost everything, whether it was global war, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was Epstein, whether it was any of these scandals, whether it was the Biden family, whether it was Biden's bad health.
[03:45:39.652 --> 03:45:40.753]  There's a reason people forget.
[03:45:40.753 --> 03:45:42.374]  That's why they kicked off of Instagram.
[03:45:42.374 --> 03:45:48.938]  You exposed Biden's first one to expose Biden's serious health problems, which now are a constant meme and source of comedy.
[03:45:49.298 --> 03:45:54.904]  The best way to do that is to continue to support InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:54.904 --> 03:45:57.347]  And I speak from personal, lived experience.
[03:45:57.347 --> 03:45:59.669]  I've been a supporter for the better part of a decade.
[03:45:59.669 --> 03:46:03.753]  I continue to, mostly because it's great products at a great price.
[03:46:03.753 --> 03:46:10.981]  But I love supporting something that keeps free, populist information on the air, out to the American people.
[03:46:11.241 --> 03:46:13.463]  This is a perspective you don't get anywhere else.
[03:46:13.463 --> 03:46:21.128]  If you want to keep it, if you want to keep the First Amendment, if you want to keep this voice on the air, continue to support InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:21.128 --> 03:46:32.575]  Find something you like, that you need anyway, at an affordable, accessible price, and get back at the Deep State, because this is still the best public tool against the Deep State that exists.
[03:46:32.575 --> 03:46:35.437]  That's the reason why it was such a target for the last half decade.
[03:46:35.437 --> 03:46:39.780]  And there's nobody that does that better than the InfoWars audience, and they do it better,
[03:46:40.100 --> 03:46:58.009]  By continuing to support InfoWars, keeping it on the air despite all the assaults and attacks, all the lies and all the libels, by going to infowarsstore.com and finding things they support.
[03:46:58.009 --> 03:47:03.892]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.114 --> 03:47:31.478]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Royce White, your guest host for the hour, and we are at the close of the hour here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and I'm extremely honored and proud to be able to host here on Info Wars, one of the most historic and legendary platforms of information fighting against the machine in the history of
[03:47:32.111 --> 03:47:37.896]  This country and of the world, I thank you for your viewership, for your listenership, for all your feedback.
[03:47:37.896 --> 03:47:45.102]  Every time I'm on Alex Jones's show on his platform, I get a ton of feedback from people all across the country, all across the world.
[03:47:45.102 --> 03:47:49.325]  And we're especially appreciative to all of those who saw me here that now translate.
[03:47:49.847 --> 03:47:53.770]  To my podcast, Please Call Me Crazy, which airs at 9 p.m.
[03:47:53.770 --> 03:47:54.651]  Central on YouTube.
[03:47:54.651 --> 03:47:59.175]  If you haven't go and watch Friday's interview with Alex Jones, I can't stress enough.
[03:47:59.175 --> 03:48:13.006]  I've watched Alex Jones all my life, and I'm not just saying that to pat myself on the back, but it was an incredible interview, and he had some very, very heartfelt and genuine moments, and we hope to get Alex Jones back on the podcast very soon.
[03:48:13.006 --> 03:48:16.809]  Tonight's episode, I covered this very Donald Trump issue.
[03:48:16.809 --> 03:48:19.431]  The episode is entitled Soros Tyranny.
[03:48:20.023 --> 03:48:20.604]  And why?
[03:48:20.604 --> 03:48:23.626]  I mean, you know, it's just ironic.
[03:48:23.626 --> 03:48:33.855]  It's so ironic that this conversation or this indictment looms around issues such as campaign finance and the misappropriation of campaign finance.
[03:48:33.855 --> 03:48:39.080]  It's like every single thing they do, every single thing the enemy does
[03:48:40.046 --> 03:48:57.603]  Not only do they do it in this sort of unabashed, unabashed, cocky manner, but they're willing to actually name it under the same exact set of corruption that they themselves are engaged in.
[03:48:57.603 --> 03:48:59.965]  I mean, it's just a slap in the face.
[03:48:59.965 --> 03:49:05.090]  The American people have been slapped in the face since the day they killed John F. Kennedy.
[03:49:06.815 --> 03:49:23.689]  You know, when they put together the Warren Commission of all the people who probably had some knowledge or something to do with John F. Kennedy's assassination, and then they told you that the magic bullet theory was what should keep you comfortable at night, it should comfort you, it should allow you to sleep well at night.
[03:49:23.689 --> 03:49:32.417]  This was the establishment, the neocon neoliberal order, the international banking cartel, the three industrial complexes, military, medicine, media.
[03:49:33.360 --> 03:49:36.905]  And what would eventually become Big Tech and the eye in the sky.
[03:49:36.905 --> 03:49:42.692]  This is the five-headed Hydra of New World Order slapping you in the face.
[03:49:42.692 --> 03:49:46.097]  It's saying, yeah, we know the founding fathers were pretty, you know, they were...
[03:49:47.017 --> 03:49:48.798]  They were a pretty smart bunch.
[03:49:48.798 --> 03:49:50.039]  They were a pretty sharp group.
[03:49:50.039 --> 03:49:57.283]  They put all these constitutional guardrails in against economic imperialism and tyranny, but guess what?
[03:49:57.283 --> 03:49:59.064]  You're so greedy.
[03:49:59.064 --> 03:50:00.065]  You're so detached.
[03:50:00.065 --> 03:50:01.245]  You're so easy to fool.
[03:50:01.245 --> 03:50:02.146]  You're so gullible.
[03:50:02.146 --> 03:50:03.306]  You're such a jerk-off.
[03:50:03.306 --> 03:50:05.027]  It doesn't matter.
[03:50:05.027 --> 03:50:07.409]  It doesn't matter how good your founding fathers were.
[03:50:07.409 --> 03:50:10.050]  It doesn't matter how good your messiah or savior are.
[03:50:10.050 --> 03:50:12.992]  It doesn't matter how good the one true living God is.
[03:50:12.992 --> 03:50:15.614]  You are a sucker.
[03:50:15.614 --> 03:50:16.134]  You're a sucker.
[03:50:17.304 --> 03:50:24.829]  We'll take your leaders, we'll string your leaders up on a cross, and oh, by the way, in the very same week, you know what else we'll do?
[03:50:24.829 --> 03:50:31.634]  We will backstop the entire Western banking system on your tax dollar.
[03:50:31.634 --> 03:50:33.135]  Because you're a jerk-off.
[03:50:33.135 --> 03:50:34.535]  I mean, that's just the real reality.
[03:50:34.535 --> 03:50:36.717]  You like jerking off more than you like freedom.
[03:50:36.717 --> 03:50:38.538]  Just come out and say it.
[03:50:38.538 --> 03:50:40.119]  Just come right on out and say it.
[03:50:40.119 --> 03:50:41.200]  That's what they want to tell you.
[03:50:41.849 --> 03:50:50.796]  And that's the animus, that's the urgency, that's the emotion that you should have towards this establishment when you wake up in the morning and when you lay your head down at night.
[03:50:50.796 --> 03:50:56.541]  This establishment thinks that you're such a jerk-off that they can do whatever they want and you'll take it.
[03:50:56.541 --> 03:51:00.704]  I think my favorite Alex Jones rant of all time was when he said,
[03:51:13.395 --> 03:51:35.250]  No giraffe, no zebra, no monkey, no alligator, no wild coyote, no hyenas, no hippopotamus, no other species on the planet would let a 250-pound man dressed like a space demon get up close to its kids.
[03:51:35.250 --> 03:51:41.654]  Only in a radical, radical anti-God, post-Enlightenment, post-Renaissance, scientific method-driven
[03:51:42.473 --> 03:51:43.755]  Lunacy!
[03:51:43.755 --> 03:51:45.817]  Would we allow these kind of things to happen?
[03:51:45.817 --> 03:51:50.942]  And, you know, before we can even talk about the freedom, I guess we have to start there.
[03:51:50.942 --> 03:52:06.177]  Because the concept of freedom, the concept of democracy, the concept of a republic, the concept of a nation and sovereignty and individual rights and alienable rights, these are sophisticated intellectual developments that came underneath
[03:52:06.747 --> 03:52:22.974]  Our founding fathers, which were a culmination of rebellion against the crown and religious monarchy, divine right of kings, blended with a new Jerusalem, a new horizon of outlook on what it means to be a nation and what it means to be a citizen.
[03:52:22.974 --> 03:52:25.135]  This was an anomaly.
[03:52:25.135 --> 03:52:32.898]  What America represents as a bastion against economic imperialism and satanic governance is an anomaly.
[03:52:32.898 --> 03:52:34.058]  It's a miracle.
[03:52:34.058 --> 03:52:35.799]  It's a modern miracle, no doubt about it.
[03:52:36.823 --> 03:52:38.324]  But it's complex.
[03:52:38.324 --> 03:52:40.626]  I mean, to really grasp it, to understand it?
[03:52:40.626 --> 03:52:56.597]  I mean, hell, if they take away all the philosophy in your schools and they give you To Kill a Mockingbird as a, you know, some grand literary work, I guess you wouldn't be able to read the Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence or our Constitution and see the brilliance and miracle of it.
[03:52:56.597 --> 03:52:58.178]  And that's all by design.
[03:52:58.178 --> 03:53:00.360]  But before we even get to the complexity of that,
[03:53:01.918 --> 03:53:11.963]  I mean, the general idea of freedom is, I mean, the most general idea of freedom should at least spark something in your mind, right?
[03:53:11.963 --> 03:53:16.625]  And I'm just watching how every single week there's something better to do.
[03:53:16.625 --> 03:53:17.546]  Bread and circuses.
[03:53:17.546 --> 03:53:21.848]  And then somebody like me or Alex, we say bread and circuses and you hear it.
[03:53:22.705 --> 03:53:28.550]  And you understand it, for most people in the audience, most people who would call us conspiracy theorists, we couldn't tell them anything.
[03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:43.401]  I could walk up to them on the street, open my hand, my very, uh, big hands, uh, and slap them right in the face with the word truth written across it in Sharpie, and they still wouldn't be able to see it.
[03:53:43.401 --> 03:53:50.526]  Um, but, but even some of us who are in the movement, we hear bread and circuses and we kind of go, yeah, that makes sense.
[03:53:50.526 --> 03:53:51.547]  We are really distracted.
[03:53:53.558 --> 03:54:03.088]  But the system could not continue if we actually, if we actually resign from the distraction the way that we criticize it.
[03:54:03.088 --> 03:54:13.620]  And that's Fox News, and that's sports, and that's technology, porn, you know, the list goes on.
[03:54:14.622 --> 03:54:16.824]  I mean, make no mistake about it.
[03:54:16.824 --> 03:54:22.449]  Where we are today in this country is a product and a result of our lack of righteousness.
[03:54:22.449 --> 03:54:25.012]  And that's the only thing that's going to fix it.
[03:54:25.012 --> 03:54:31.498]  And I commend Alex Jones for being the tip of the spear on the spiritual front and saying, this is a spiritual war.
[03:54:31.498 --> 03:54:38.845]  We have to correct the spiritual side before we could have any hope or chance or desire to fix what is broken.
[03:54:39.821 --> 03:54:42.243]  And this moral hazard goes all the way back to the beginning.
[03:54:42.243 --> 03:54:54.511]  I know that the leftists and the Marxists and the globalists and the neoliberal neocons want to tell a prevailing story in our academic institutions that it was slavery and racism that was the original sin of this country.
[03:54:54.511 --> 03:54:56.293]  But that's not true.
[03:54:56.293 --> 03:55:04.779]  The original sin of this country was the business model that we that we brought over from the crown.
[03:55:04.779 --> 03:55:04.879]  And
[03:55:05.584 --> 03:55:13.391]  Even furthermore, we actually played an instrumental role in the Crown rebranding its business model after World War II.
[03:55:13.391 --> 03:55:15.173]  I've said this before, but I'll say it again.
[03:55:15.173 --> 03:55:16.614]  It's pertinent.
[03:55:16.614 --> 03:55:19.997]  They don't have any problem running Pfizer ads on you four, five, six times a day.
[03:55:19.997 --> 03:55:25.642]  You don't have any problem keeping the TV on even though you know they're brainwashing you to trust the medical industrial complex.
[03:55:25.642 --> 03:55:26.623]  So I'm going to say it again.
[03:55:26.623 --> 03:55:30.566]  The Crown's business model, drugs, slavery, piracy,
[03:55:32.082 --> 03:55:37.967]  Those are the three anchors of the Crown's business model of economic imperialism, and our founding fathers fought against that.
[03:55:37.967 --> 03:55:40.469]  They resisted that.
[03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:55.282]  But after World War II, on the back of a time of great human loss and human tragedy and a genocide, the new narrative was, the new narrative was, you know what?
[03:55:55.282 --> 03:55:56.923]  Colonialism was wrong.
[03:55:56.923 --> 03:55:57.384]  You're right.
[03:55:57.384 --> 03:55:58.765]  Hey, Churchill.
[03:55:59.651 --> 03:56:01.572]  Renounce your claim to the colonial empire.
[03:56:01.572 --> 03:56:04.593]  We'll help you beat the Nazis.
[03:56:04.593 --> 03:56:05.793]  But it's still the Commonwealth.
[03:56:05.793 --> 03:56:07.954]  It's still the Commonwealth.
[03:56:07.954 --> 03:56:09.855]  It's still the Five Eyes.
[03:56:09.855 --> 03:56:11.075]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:56:11.075 --> 03:56:15.177]  King Charles is still the head monarch in Canada.
[03:56:15.177 --> 03:56:23.260]  Prince Edward of Kent is still the Grand Master of the Grand United Lodge there in the UK in Great Britain.
[03:56:23.260 --> 03:56:25.100]  We're still living under Masonic rule.
[03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:27.181]  We're still living under the Crown.
[03:56:28.112 --> 03:56:32.834]  And all the other groups in there too that you want to throw in that you say are in cahoots and collaboration.
[03:56:32.834 --> 03:56:45.939]  All of that's great, but we're still living under slavery, drugs, piracy, and all they're telling you now is, and what they've done is, we're going to improve slavery.
[03:56:45.939 --> 03:56:47.940]  We're not going to make slavery racial specific.
[03:56:47.940 --> 03:56:49.440]  Why stop there?
[03:56:49.440 --> 03:56:52.281]  We're not going to make slavery chains, ball and chains.
[03:56:52.281 --> 03:56:53.102]  Why?
[03:56:53.102 --> 03:56:53.722]  That's messy.
[03:56:54.403 --> 03:56:55.964]  That doesn't look good for optics.
[03:56:55.964 --> 03:57:02.890]  What we'll do is we'll enslave your mind and we'll expand it to every man, woman, and child of every race, nation, or creed all across the planet.
[03:57:02.890 --> 03:57:07.454]  And that's what this is meant to, this is what this is meant to usher in.
[03:57:07.454 --> 03:57:09.996]  The National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[03:57:09.996 --> 03:57:17.962]  Might as well say slavery writ large brought to you not by none other than the crown.
[03:57:17.962 --> 03:57:19.183]  That's where we're headed, folks.
[03:57:19.183 --> 03:57:21.605]  Donald Trump is the herald in these kangaroo courts.
[03:57:21.605 --> 03:57:23.086]  Alex Jones as well as Steve Bannon.
[03:57:23.086 --> 03:57:23.947]  I'm sure I'll be next.
[03:57:24.634 --> 03:57:26.196]  I'm your guest host Royce White.
[03:57:26.196 --> 03:57:28.678]  Please remember to tune in tonight at 9 p.m.
[03:57:28.678 --> 03:57:29.459]  on YouTube.
[03:57:29.459 --> 03:57:30.260]  That's 9 p.m.
[03:57:30.260 --> 03:57:31.221]  Central.
[03:57:31.221 --> 03:57:35.725]  I am honored and thankful for another chance to host this legendary platform.
[03:57:35.725 --> 03:57:38.788]  Thank you to Alex Jones and the entire InfoWars team.
[03:57:38.788 --> 03:57:40.269]  The fight continues.

[03:58:10.007 --> 03:58:11.488]  This one is really special.

[03:58:47.130 --> 03:58:59.807]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border, exposing the cartels, and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city, hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:58:59.807 --> 03:59:01.589]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:59:01.589 --> 03:59:03.352]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:59:03.743 --> 03:59:06.545]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:59:06.545 --> 03:59:08.267]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:59:08.267 --> 03:59:10.769]  And again, I, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:59:10.769 --> 03:59:15.132]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:59:15.132 --> 03:59:20.857]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:59:20.857 --> 03:59:25.841]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:59:25.841 --> 03:59:28.984]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[03:59:29.104 --> 03:59:32.025]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
