[00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:20.983]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.121]  It's Sunday, September 24th, 2023.
[00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:35.027]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we take you first to the battlefront in the proxy war between NATO and the Russians, backed by the U.S.
[00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:42.192]  taxpayer, where Seymour Hersh, with the highest level sources, confirms what we can analyze for ourselves.
[00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:51.478]  The Russians have won the war against NATO in Ukraine, and no amount of heavy weapons will ever stop that.
[00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:52.819]  But they don't care.
[00:00:52.819 --> 00:01:03.006]  They're massively money laundering, and of course, using the crisis to cut off grain supplies to the world, to accelerate their societal collapse.
[00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:04.407]  Here's the headline.
[00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:05.168]  Seymour Hersh.
[00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:08.150]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.334]  Zelensky's battered army no longer has any chance of a victory.
[00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:17.796]  Intelligence sources tell Hirsch the war is over.
[00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.257]  Russia has won.
[00:01:19.257 --> 00:01:22.019]  There is no Ukrainian offensive anymore.
[00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:26.843]  But the White House and the American media have to keep lies going.
[00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:54.790]  We're gonna go to break here in a few minutes to come back with this as our top story But I wanted you to know that we're gonna be covering that first in detail Then I want to tie it all together Zelensky in DC last week spent most of his time begging for money and of course saying climate change is destroying the world and Flooding our coastal cities and causing tornadoes and hurricanes and that we all need to drive electric cars But then John Kerry
[00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:08.973]  I went on national television and said that we need to totally get rid of our combustion engines because China's getting rid of them, because China is flooding, and China knows how important it is to save the earth.
[00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:11.193]  That is the sickest gaslighting I've ever seen.
[00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:18.455]  In fact, we started having annual gaslighting awards, and hands down, that would win it so far for 2023.
[00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:22.076]  Ladies and gentlemen, China is building three new coal power plants a week.
[00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:26.579]  China has the largest carbon footprint in the world, and I'm not saying that's even bad.
[00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.500]  Carbon's good.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.241]  It's what we're made of, what the atmosphere is made of.
[00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:31.703]  But the idea of that is just next level.
[00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:44.173]  So we're going to look at how these wars, these open borders, the carbon taxes, the shutting off the power of the West is part of this larger globalist agenda to empower China and cause deindustrialization in the West.
[00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:46.494]  To bring us to our knees, we'll be looking at those stories.
[00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:47.635]  That's
[00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:10.796]  I don't know.
[00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:37.408]  There is a giant awakening, but our enemies are striking back with more surveillance, more censorship, more lawfare, more weaponized Justice Department.
[00:03:37.408 --> 00:03:41.709]  But we forced the enemy to take the mask off.
[00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:50.551]  And speaking of the different globalist programs they've got to bring down the Western world and complete the megacorporation's domination and hegemony over the planet.
[00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:57.872]  Biden, a few days ago, blamed Trump for the border crisis, but then went on to say what his solution was, which is
[00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:14.371]  Basically turning the border into a turnstile where anybody can come in and we'll be given quote assistance and then as the cities implode because the way the feds are going to federalize the cities and bring in federalized grocery stores everything else
[00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:15.252]  I think?
[00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:41.738]  Hellscape Open Society at the UN and Klaus Schwab, and of course, Memphis Society is the Open Society Foundation, George Soros.
[00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:44.783]  We'll be right back on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:45.364]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:06.545]  My fellow patriots, the Trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:16.228]  Many of these products have been sold out for years, but we've not had all three of them at once together at InfoWarsTore.com for 40% off.

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.844]  The last beacon of truth in a world of deception, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:25.877]  It's Sunday, September 24th, 2023.
[00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:28.318]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.318 --> 00:06:34.480]  We are about to go through a massive list of incredible news, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.121]  Speaking of the bad and the ugly, I first want to go to a big story from Zero Edge.
[00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:42.142]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:47.364]  Seymour Hersh, Zelensky's battered army, no longer has any chance of victory.
[00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:50.265]  Intelligence sources tell Hersh the war is over.
[00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:51.105]  Russia has won.
[00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:53.747]  There's no Ukrainian offensive anymore.
[00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.690]  But the lie-outs to the American media have to keep the lie going.
[00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.154]  Now, first off, Hirsch is one of the most award-winning, trusted reporters ever.
[00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:09.600]  He is the thoroughbred, triple-crown winner, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.022]  I give him about a 99% accuracy rate.
[00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:13.663]  But I don't have to go off Hirsch.
[00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:15.044]  We've got Colonel McGregor.
[00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:17.266]  We've got reporters on the ground.
[00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.328]  We've got all the intel coming out.
[00:07:19.328 --> 00:07:19.788]  It is a
[00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:23.231]  Fact that 500,000 Ukrainians have died.
[00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:29.395]  It is a fact that the Russians never intended to take the whole country, but tended to take only those eastern areas as a security buffer.
[00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:45.745]  It is a fact that NATO knew they would lose the entire time, but they win laundering hundreds of millions of dollars and expanding NATO and of course being able to shut off the grain and then blame that for the larger food collapse at the UN.
[00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:48.587]  The WF have been running with policies
[00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:54.098]  The big danger here is that they may continue to escalate with more heavy weapons.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.921]  And double down with the Russians.
[00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:59.523]  That will just cause the Russians to double down themselves again.
[00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:02.265]  But Poland is pulling out of the war.
[00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:05.186]  The polls show 80% of Americans are against the war.
[00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:07.628]  Europe is completely turning against the war.
[00:08:07.628 --> 00:08:15.113]  People are waking up to just how out of control and dangerous this march towards thermal nuclear World War III is.
[00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:19.796]  Let's continue with the article, breaking down Cy Hirst's latest report.
[00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:28.261]  The clandestine bombings, the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines under the Baltic Sea happened on September 26, 2022.
[00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:30.582]  This coming Tuesday will mark the one-year anniversary.
[00:08:30.582 --> 00:08:40.789]  The prospect of a direct NATO-Russia war has only continued to grow, and some possible nuclear World War III-level disasters and catastrophe to grow into that.
[00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.550]  Still looming darkly on
[00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:44.461]  All right.
[00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:04.913]  Is that Zelensky's battered army no longer has any chance of victory.
[00:09:04.913 --> 00:09:12.782]  Whereas previously there was a vast chasm between Hearst's conclusions and those of the Western press reports, this is no longer the case.
[00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:15.065]  Just as The Economist this week reported.
[00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:17.388]  And The Economist is the mouth of the New World Order.
[00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:32.617]  The narrative dissonance must be particularly jolting for the average Americans who up until this point have been treated to a constant rosy pictures and overly optimistic reports of Ukraine winning or at least pushing back the Russians.
[00:09:32.617 --> 00:09:39.240]  This was certainly the mainstream's driving theme as last throughout the first year of the war and even into the summer.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.262]  I remember the defense minister a few months ago before they launched their counter offensive.
[00:09:43.262 --> 00:09:46.423]  The Ukrainian defense minister said we're going to go all the way to Moscow with our tanks.
[00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:47.884]  Delusions of grandeur.
[00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:22.009]  The truth is the Ukrainian army is ordered to continue the offense of the army with mutiny.
[00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:24.111]  The soldiers aren't willing to die anymore.
[00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:28.335]  But this doesn't fit the BS that's being authored by the White House.
[00:10:28.335 --> 00:10:35.163]  The intelligence source explained the conclusion, perhaps given some degree of confirmation when Zelensky met with Biden on Thursday.
[00:10:36.738 --> 00:10:42.023]  Lackluster is how the previously generated characterized the mood.
[00:10:42.023 --> 00:10:50.091]  Nothing new of importance was announced by Biden other than a measly $325 million military aid package for already approved funds.
[00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:55.456]  There was also the mention of limited or little US long-range missiles approved for Kiev.
[00:10:56.874 --> 00:11:00.775]  Now Congress wants $24 billion, though, to rebuild Ukraine.
[00:11:00.775 --> 00:11:03.375]  That's the next leg of the money laundering operation.
[00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:06.296]  Of course, the Clintons will then take control of the IMF, World Bank, U.S.
[00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:10.937]  taxpayer money and European taxpayer money and siphon it back to themselves.
[00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:12.317]  That's what I added.
[00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:19.498]  So it goes on from there and lays out some of the points I made about Poland and the rest of it.
[00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:23.299]  Meanwhile, Ukraine, it appears, with direct targeting and intelligence
[00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:25.560]  So that's NATO's insane and the globalists insane wish.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.304]  is to use a major war with Russia to bring in a collapse of the old system.
[00:11:53.304 --> 00:12:02.692]  That'll do it better than opening the borders and shipping in fentanyl and devaluing currencies and turning blue cities and states into crackhead hellscapes.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.922]  And they're willing to do that to bring in their new world order.
[00:12:06.922 --> 00:12:08.322]  It'll kill a bunch of Russians.
[00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:09.703]  It'll kill a bunch of Americans.
[00:12:09.703 --> 00:12:11.304]  It'll kill a bunch of Europeans.
[00:12:11.304 --> 00:12:17.807]  Then they can resettle us with a replacement migration for more easily managed third world populations.
[00:12:17.807 --> 00:12:24.470]  And this all ties into the further shutting off of our energy and food resources and the fertilizer growing.
[00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.392]  Folks, the decisions that have already been put in place are going to cause
[00:12:28.012 --> 00:12:29.673]  Hundreds of millions of starved to death.
[00:12:29.673 --> 00:12:33.875]  The UN even admits it, but they don't tell you they're the ones that are behind it.
[00:12:33.875 --> 00:12:47.983]  Here is the globalist puppet Zelensky just a few days ago at the UN and in between demanding millions of dollars more, he said that we all need to get on board with the globalist plan to cut off our energy.
[00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:49.504]  We're good to go.
[00:13:09.867 --> 00:13:18.433]  As the globalists actually turn off all the resources and infrastructure to create the self-fulfilling prophecy which they themselves will then be the saviors of.
[00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:21.495]  So I'm going to play a short clip of Zelensky at the UN.
[00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:33.062]  We're going to go to break and tie it in with the biggest gaslighting lies I've ever seen from John Kerry, claiming China is the leader in saving the world from fossil fuels.
[00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.543]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:13:34.543 --> 00:13:35.644]  But first, Zelensky.
[00:13:36.578 --> 00:13:51.835]  Even though humanity is failing on its climate policy objectives, this means that extreme weather will still impact the normal global life and some evil state will also weaponize its outcomes.
[00:13:53.325 --> 00:14:04.033]  And when people in the streets of New York and other cities of the world went out on climate protest, we all have seen them.
[00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:12.018]  And when people in Morocco and Libya and other countries die as a result of natural disasters,
[00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:36.257]  And when islands and countries disappear underwater, and when tornadoes and deserts are spreading into new territories, and when all of this is happening, one unnatural disaster in Moscow decided to launch a big war and kill tens of thousands of people.
[00:14:36.257 --> 00:14:37.238]  We have to stop it.
[00:14:39.318 --> 00:14:49.923]  We must act united to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges.
[00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:59.851]  As nukes are restrained, likewise the aggressor must be restrained at all his tools and methods of war.
[00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:08.575]  Each war now can become final, but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will not break in again.
[00:15:09.395 --> 00:15:26.931]  And it is not a dialogue between the so-called great powers somewhere behind the closed doors that can guarantee us all the new wars era, but open war of all nations for peace.
[00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:31.996]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.

[00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:07.038]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.831]  And welcome back to this live, original Sunday transmission.
[00:20:30.831 --> 00:20:32.192]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.192 --> 00:20:34.733]  If you just joined us, let me recap what we just covered.
[00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:42.656]  The Russians have defeated NATO and the Ukrainians, hands down, but the globalists are using it as a giant destabilization tool and a money laundering tool.
[00:20:43.826 --> 00:21:01.702]  And a cover for massive world starvation being accelerated by globalist policies cutting off energy, and of course, energy for plants, the fertilizer, and having three years of lockdowns, the third world, the IMF and World Bank policy over those captive nations.
[00:21:01.702 --> 00:21:07.126]  Now the third world is completely collapsing and flooding us via UN migration camps.
[00:21:08.174 --> 00:21:08.354]  I think?
[00:21:36.624 --> 00:21:41.228]  Grain and similar number to the shortage in fertilizer.
[00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:50.395]  But the overall fertilizer shortages are publicly being driven by the IMF and World Bank and those same WEF UN policies.
[00:21:50.395 --> 00:21:51.996]  And they're the ones shutting off the pipelines.
[00:21:51.996 --> 00:21:54.798]  They're the ones killing the oil and gas drilling permits.
[00:21:54.798 --> 00:22:03.765]  They're the ones banning all over Europe and now in the US all sorts of gas powered machines and farm equipment and combustion engines.
[00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:04.825]  So this is
[00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:28.126]  The post-industrial world, the reason you've got Zelensky up there pushing this during his warmongering speech is because it's all part of the same agenda that is war against humanity to shut down the infrastructure and then again have the IMF, the World Bank, the big central banks, the Black Rocks, through their front group, the UN, come in and act as the saviors.
[00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:30.647]  So now I want to go to the biggest gaslighting
[00:22:31.087 --> 00:22:31.848]  I've ever seen.
[00:22:31.848 --> 00:22:33.509]  And that's saying a lot, folks.
[00:22:33.509 --> 00:22:43.076]  They've shown us polar bears sitting on top of a piece of floating ice and said they can't swim and they're all about to drown because the North Pole completely melted.
[00:22:43.076 --> 00:22:47.139]  No, the North Pole always gets about half as big as it is in the winter.
[00:22:47.139 --> 00:22:47.780]  During the summer,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:55.845]  And that's when the polar bears get fat is in the summer and they hunt on the ice flows eating beluga whales and seals and things like that.
[00:22:55.845 --> 00:22:59.608]  They're the farthest swimming land animal up to 200 miles.
[00:22:59.608 --> 00:23:03.791]  They've been observed swimming non-stop from one ice flow to another.
[00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:05.592]  They also say the penguins are all dying.
[00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:07.654]  I mean, there's been a lot of
[00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:15.781]  Incredible lies, but if you actually study the numbers since the 1950s, there are five times the polar bears there were in the mid 1950s.
[00:23:15.781 --> 00:23:18.463]  Today, the biggest population ever recorded.
[00:23:18.463 --> 00:23:20.885]  But again, I digress.
[00:23:20.885 --> 00:23:22.167]  There's a lot of gaslighting.
[00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:28.492]  Al Gore told us in the 90s and the 2000s that, oh, by the year 2007, the North and South Pole will be melted.
[00:23:28.492 --> 00:23:29.193]  They're bigger than ever.
[00:23:29.873 --> 00:23:40.084]  We've seen John Kerry say in the Senate when he was a senator in the mid-2000s that within a few years the ice caps would be totally melted or this island or that island would be completely flooded.
[00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:41.326]  None of it came true.
[00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:42.367]  It's all a fraud.
[00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:43.548]  It's all a lie.
[00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:47.853]  It's water vapor that controls the atmosphere with the sun as the regulator.
[00:23:47.853 --> 00:23:48.133]  Okay?
[00:23:48.133 --> 00:23:49.254]  The sun's the driver.
[00:23:49.254 --> 00:23:50.255]  It's water vapor.
[00:23:50.255 --> 00:23:51.256]  All the scientists know that.
[00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:58.204]  Carbon dioxide is a trace gas, but it's what plants breathe and what plants exhale is oxygen.
[00:23:58.204 --> 00:24:04.050]  So now Al Gore and the rest of them are saying cut down trees because they put off carbon dioxide as well.
[00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.091]  This is an IQ test.
[00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:06.432]  You're not stupid, folks.
[00:24:06.432 --> 00:24:10.616]  Here is John Kerry on national television this week.
[00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:28.694]  Telling the world in a roundtable discussion that China has floods and China has hot weather and they know the world's basically ending and so they're the leader and the biggest producer of green products, you know, solar and electric cars and they're saving the planet.
[00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:30.556]  Solar is incredibly dirty to manufacture.
[00:24:30.976 --> 00:24:33.278]  Electric cars are incredibly dirty to manufacture.
[00:24:33.278 --> 00:24:35.539]  This is a known fact.
[00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:38.761]  And they are then powered by coal-powered plants.
[00:24:38.761 --> 00:24:44.966]  All the solar in the world can't run the electric cars if they converted even half the cars in the world to electric.
[00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:46.547]  So it's a bridge to nowhere.
[00:24:46.547 --> 00:24:47.508]  It's incredibly dirty.
[00:24:48.228 --> 00:25:02.722]  They want to get rid of cars in general, so they want to give you, again, a bridge to nowhere, a false solution so you acquiesce to the industrialization, de-industrialization program that they are running.
[00:25:02.722 --> 00:25:04.905]  So here he is saying China is the leader.
[00:25:04.905 --> 00:25:11.591]  No, China is the leader with globalist owning and controlling the factories in China as a client state, as a slave colony.
[00:25:12.612 --> 00:25:19.735]  Producing the most electric cars, producing the majority of solar panels to be sold back to Europe and the United States.
[00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:26.517]  I mean, if we're going to build these costly, dirty things, then we might as well build them here in the United States.
[00:25:26.517 --> 00:25:28.318]  And they certainly have some uses.
[00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:29.418]  And I'm not against solar.
[00:25:29.418 --> 00:25:30.718]  And I'm not against electric.
[00:25:30.718 --> 00:25:39.341]  The point is, is they're way more expensive and way more toxic to make with their giant, horrible lithium and cadmium and nickel and copper mines.
[00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:40.482]  But again, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:25:40.982 --> 00:25:42.383]  They think you're stupid.
[00:25:42.383 --> 00:25:45.545]  They think you don't know how the world really works.
[00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:49.728]  So I want you to listen to this incredible gaslighting from John Kerry.
[00:25:49.728 --> 00:25:50.448]  It's a short clip.
[00:25:50.448 --> 00:25:57.052]  So I'm going to play it two times, back to back, so you can hear this and really let this burn in.
[00:25:57.052 --> 00:25:59.514]  China's building three new coal power plants a week.
[00:26:00.234 --> 00:26:04.180]  China has produced tens of millions of electric cars and dumped them on the world market.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.585]  They blow up, they burn, they're the crappiest electric cars ever.
[00:26:07.585 --> 00:26:09.868]  Most electric cars have serious problems.
[00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:10.990]  A lot of them blow up.
[00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.955]  But the Chinese cars are literally ticking time bombs.
[00:26:15.456 --> 00:26:17.318]  They're blowing up every few hours.
[00:26:17.318 --> 00:26:19.639]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[00:26:19.639 --> 00:26:21.140]  It's just totally insane.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:26.745]  You've got the driverless cars in Austin, Texas and San Francisco causing traffic jams every day.
[00:26:26.745 --> 00:26:30.007]  It's all meant to disrupt human society.
[00:26:30.007 --> 00:26:35.591]  So I'm ranting here because everything that comes out of these people's mouths is a lie.
[00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:36.772]  Polar bears aren't dying.
[00:26:36.772 --> 00:26:37.833]  They're exploding.
[00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:40.015]  Polar bear is the greatest land animal swimmer there are.
[00:26:40.755 --> 00:26:42.236]  The ice caps are bigger than ever.
[00:26:42.236 --> 00:26:43.437]  Oh, there's new reports out.
[00:26:43.437 --> 00:26:46.279]  Oh, Antarctica has plants for the first time.
[00:26:46.279 --> 00:27:01.609]  I've read naval histories, I got into this like 20 years ago, by the British and the French, and they described the first missions down there by whalers, and they described times when, as far as the eye could see, Antarctica was grass in the areas that are land-based.
[00:27:02.489 --> 00:27:04.030]  Part of it's a mountainous region.
[00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.450]  The plants have always been there.
[00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.351]  There's at least five plant species there.
[00:27:07.351 --> 00:27:09.492]  But they think that you don't know that.
[00:27:09.492 --> 00:27:11.992]  So they go, oh look, everything's melting.
[00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:13.673]  There's flowers in the Arctic.
[00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:15.614]  There's always been flowers in the Arctic.
[00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:17.852]  I digress.
[00:27:17.852 --> 00:27:20.853]  Ignorance is their key to taking over.
[00:27:20.853 --> 00:27:23.474]  Information is the key to being free.
[00:27:23.474 --> 00:27:25.735]  Those that do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:27:25.735 --> 00:27:29.136]  And as the Bible says, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:45.003]  So here's John Kerry in the ultimate gaslighting, back-to-back, saying China is the leader in the environment, they're the biggest carbon producer, which is not a problem, but they're also the biggest toxic waste producer, which is a problem, and the most wild, out-of-control genetic engineer operation on the planet as well.
[00:27:45.003 --> 00:27:46.023]  Here's the clip back-to-back.
[00:27:47.139 --> 00:27:51.401]  Outbuilding everybody in renewable energy.
[00:27:51.401 --> 00:27:54.323]  And they're deploying that energy at home.
[00:27:54.323 --> 00:28:01.526]  And literally China is now deploying and manufacturing more than all the rest of the world put together.
[00:28:01.526 --> 00:28:03.207]  So China's made a decision.
[00:28:03.207 --> 00:28:05.808]  They had 52 degrees centigrade that last summer.
[00:28:05.808 --> 00:28:09.570]  They've had people dying because of the floods in China.
[00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.131]  So our hope is that we can
[00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:15.252]  You know, de-politicize this issue, at least.
[00:28:15.252 --> 00:28:17.232]  It's a universal threat.
[00:28:17.232 --> 00:28:19.353]  We all need to be engaged in this.
[00:28:19.353 --> 00:28:22.753]  We need China, and we hope we can work with China in this.
[00:28:22.753 --> 00:28:31.175]  So, Alexa's outbuilding everybody in renewable energy, and they're deploying that energy at home.
[00:28:31.175 --> 00:28:37.537]  And literally, China is now deploying and manufacturing more than all the rest of the world put together.
[00:28:38.377 --> 00:28:40.078]  So China's made a decision.
[00:28:40.078 --> 00:28:42.678]  They had 52 degrees centigrade that last summer.
[00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:46.420]  They've had people dying because of the floods in China.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:52.122]  So our hope is that we can depoliticize this issue, at least.
[00:28:52.122 --> 00:28:54.122]  It's a universal threat.
[00:28:54.122 --> 00:28:56.243]  We all need to be engaged in this.
[00:28:56.243 --> 00:28:57.543]  We need China.
[00:28:57.543 --> 00:28:59.284]  And we hope we can work with China.
[00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:00.684]  Lie down and take it.
[00:29:00.684 --> 00:29:02.546]  Spread the word about this broadcast.

[00:29:44.507 --> 00:29:44.787]  Uh, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:44.787 --> 00:29:45.828]  So, my name is Ken Heckenlobby.
[00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:06.546]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:30:06.546 --> 00:30:12.853]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:16.256]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:20.240]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.863]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well,
[00:30:23.423 --> 00:30:29.748]  Take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:30:29.748 --> 00:30:37.433]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:30:37.433 --> 00:30:43.577]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:30:43.577 --> 00:30:44.298]  All right, we love you.
[00:30:44.298 --> 00:30:44.918]  We'll be right back.

[00:32:51.524 --> 00:32:54.846]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.741 --> 00:33:23.686]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:33:23.686 --> 00:33:25.768]  You better believe you got one!
[00:33:41.488 --> 00:33:44.132]  And we are back on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:33:44.132 --> 00:33:45.294]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.294 --> 00:33:46.736]  Very honored and blessed that you're here.
[00:33:46.736 --> 00:33:52.404]  I get pretty angry when I start laying all these facts out because this is economic warfare.
[00:33:52.404 --> 00:33:53.585]  This is Siege 101.
[00:33:55.643 --> 00:33:58.444]  Gary say China is leading the world in green energy.
[00:33:58.444 --> 00:33:59.444]  Well, not for themselves.
[00:33:59.444 --> 00:34:01.265]  They're exporting it to us.
[00:34:01.265 --> 00:34:04.006]  It's expensive and doesn't work overall.
[00:34:04.006 --> 00:34:12.768]  And of course, it is then powered by carbon generating factories here in the United States, which our so-called leaders are busy shutting down.
[00:34:12.768 --> 00:34:15.729]  So there won't be any power for your electric car.
[00:34:15.729 --> 00:34:20.410]  And then of course, we have Zelensky saying the most important thing is, quote, saving the environment.
[00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:25.252]  That means handing all control over to BlackRock and the ESGs and their plan.
[00:34:25.712 --> 00:34:27.394]  This is all interconnected.
[00:34:27.394 --> 00:34:30.897]  Remember, the system isn't broken.
[00:34:30.897 --> 00:34:34.440]  The system is predatory, designed to break you.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.043]  We have to take the system back.
[00:34:37.043 --> 00:34:38.504]  Now, there's a very popular professor.
[00:34:38.504 --> 00:34:39.625]  I've wanted to get him on for years.
[00:34:39.625 --> 00:34:41.367]  We're going to really push to get him on.
[00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:42.328]  Peter St.
[00:34:42.328 --> 00:34:43.689]  Honnage, if I pronounced that right.
[00:34:43.689 --> 00:34:44.890]  I guess it's French.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:48.634]  PhDs, big professor, works at the Von Mies Institute.
[00:34:48.634 --> 00:34:50.416]  But he's also extremely articulate.
[00:34:50.996 --> 00:34:57.322]  And so I want to play several clips of him from his Twitter site that are going mega viral.
[00:34:57.322 --> 00:35:06.331]  He points out that he's a guy with a computer and he's getting three, four million views per video and CNN gets 50,000 views per video now.
[00:35:06.331 --> 00:35:08.513]  And of course, CNN has the lowest ratings ever recorded.
[00:35:08.513 --> 00:35:09.994]  I just want to point that out that.
[00:35:11.084 --> 00:35:12.465]  They're not just the dinosaur media.
[00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:13.746]  They're the zombie media.
[00:35:13.746 --> 00:35:14.526]  They're dead.
[00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:15.867]  Almost no one's watching it.
[00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:20.090]  But it's still a government deep state channel with their talking points.
[00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.151]  So it's important to be aware of what they're up to.
[00:35:22.151 --> 00:35:24.052]  But I digress.
[00:35:24.052 --> 00:35:27.394]  Let's get into his first video that ties it all together.
[00:35:27.394 --> 00:35:30.656]  Is the Green Revolution creating a dozen OPECs?
[00:35:30.656 --> 00:35:35.559]  Green tech is turning the West into an economic colony of China and the BRICS.
[00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:37.261]  The problem is green techs
[00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:38.682]  We're good to go.
[00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:05.649]  And we're completely dependent not just on Chinese slave goods now, but on our very energy system.
[00:36:05.649 --> 00:36:07.811]  So you can see how we're being held hostage.
[00:36:07.811 --> 00:36:11.474]  The result is levels of dependence OPEC could only dream of.
[00:36:11.474 --> 00:36:19.099]  Just a handful of BRICS countries control the majority of those inputs to make the so-called green products.
[00:36:19.099 --> 00:36:25.624]  Remember, China has 90 plus percent control, 97 percent control of rare earth minerals.
[00:36:26.064 --> 00:36:37.787]  That's because if any Western country or company tries to go explore them, the green organizations of the UN and the regulators come in and sue them into oblivion and claim they're using slave labor.
[00:36:37.787 --> 00:36:44.929]  But if China wants to use real slave labor and move it anywhere and be as toxic as they want to be and leach these elements out of the rocks,
[00:36:45.089 --> 00:36:46.169]  We're good to go.
[00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:21.761]  It has to do with an agenda of energy that via regulations are only allowed to be produced in China because they're so toxic in their production, then shipped back over here to us, making us totally dependent.
[00:37:21.761 --> 00:37:28.364]  And of course, the globalists own large percentages in those manufacturing facilities in China, in India, in Mexico.
[00:37:28.364 --> 00:37:33.987]  And so they're the middlemen that make the majority of the profit, not even the communist Chinese or their slaves.
[00:37:33.987 --> 00:37:35.508]  So here is the professor laying it out.
[00:37:36.107 --> 00:37:45.071]  The Green Revolution is turning the West into an economic colony of China and a rogues gallery of dictators from all over the world.
[00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:56.177]  Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that the green energy push is forcing the US and Europe into a dependent relationship with authoritarian regimes that makes OPEC look like an amateur.
[00:37:56.977 --> 00:38:06.983]  This could effectively hand, especially the BRICS group of anti-dollar countries, a natural resources veto on America, indeed on the entire West.
[00:38:06.983 --> 00:38:12.306]  The problem is that the key ingredients in green tech are all dug out of the ground.
[00:38:12.306 --> 00:38:18.930]  Dug out with the kind of carbon footprints that send our ruling left-wing activists into panic attacks.
[00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.352]  Cobalt, nickel, lithium and copper are what batteries are made of.
[00:38:23.072 --> 00:38:29.440]  And without batteries, an electric vehicle, windmill, or solar field is a very expensive paperweight.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:37.871]  To give a sense of the problem, Saudi Arabia accounts for 12% of global oil production, and OPEC as a whole is 38%.
[00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:39.433]  Throw in Russia and it's close to half.
[00:38:40.114 --> 00:38:47.558]  Meanwhile, in nickel, just two countries, Indonesia and Russia, make up 27% of global production.
[00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:54.041]  For lithium, Nubricks member Argentina and Chile account for 43% of global production.
[00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:59.344]  For cobalt, again, two countries, Indonesia and Congo, make up 51% of global production.
[00:39:01.645 --> 00:39:06.590]  Downstream, where the raw materials are refined for actual use, it's even worse.
[00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:14.699]  China alone refines 42% of the world's copper, 65% of its lithium, 70% of the world's cobalt.
[00:39:14.699 --> 00:39:18.183]  China has already weaponized rare earths, and it is eager for more.
[00:39:18.783 --> 00:39:31.470]  Note that, thanks to trillion-dollar green subsidies, demand for these critical materials is expected to soar 23-fold in the next 12 years.
[00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:36.232]  For a sense of perspective, it takes 15 years to stand up a copper mine in the U.S.
[00:39:36.232 --> 00:39:37.693]  if you can get it permitted.
[00:39:38.473 --> 00:39:40.115]  So, how did things get so bad?
[00:39:40.115 --> 00:39:53.830]  Because for decades, America and Europe have chased out mining and refining, sending it overseas where those carbon footprints are out of sight and out of mind, so they can pretend it doesn't exist and brag about their clean economies and impressive footprints.
[00:39:54.491 --> 00:40:01.097]  Of course, refining cobalt in China or digging it up in Congo are just as dirty as doing it in the U.S.
[00:40:01.097 --> 00:40:06.281]  or Europe, quite likely dirtier, but optics are everything when it comes to being green.
[00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:10.825]  The problem comes in because we are potentially handing a dozen OPEX
[00:40:11.385 --> 00:40:14.787]  Two countries that don't particularly like us very much.
[00:40:14.787 --> 00:40:33.879]  China already holds a virtual materials veto over parts of the American economy, and forcing more of our industrial base and energy production into green technologies that depend on China's good graces is a recipe for becoming dependent on a country that is already actively hostile.
[00:40:33.879 --> 00:40:34.599]  So what's next?
[00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:35.760]  Brought to you by Unchained.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.921]  What's next is it gets worse.
[00:40:37.921 --> 00:40:50.967]  Both America and Europe are doubling down on the unicorn fart utopias, chasing out what remains of not just mining and refining, but the manufacturing that remains a stain on their virtuous carbon footprints.
[00:40:50.967 --> 00:41:00.532]  I did a recent video on Germany de-industrializing, and it is happening across the West, including here in America, where the United Auto Workers are currently striking
[00:41:01.212 --> 00:41:10.197]  Specifically because green mandates are sending production to China, where it will become yet another leverage point for the dictators in Beijing.
[00:41:10.197 --> 00:41:12.538]  Okay, we'll be watching.
[00:41:12.538 --> 00:41:16.099]  See you next time.
[00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:18.421]  And that's Professor Peter St.
[00:41:18.421 --> 00:41:22.583]  Onage doing a splendid job breaking down the reality.
[00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:25.004]  Just like me, he talks fast because if I slow down,
[00:41:27.769 --> 00:41:29.270]  My brain's moving too quick.
[00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.652]  If I slow down, my brain jumps ahead of me.
[00:41:31.652 --> 00:41:36.895]  And so we've just got so much knowledge and so much intel, it's hard to get it out in the spoken word.
[00:41:36.895 --> 00:41:41.218]  It's easier just to write it down, but so many people don't read, so it's important for us to speak.
[00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:44.220]  But I would challenge listeners to take that three and a half minute clip,
[00:41:45.117 --> 00:41:45.197]  Yes.
[00:42:01.337 --> 00:42:01.457]  It's
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.821]  That's a week of research.
[00:42:21.821 --> 00:42:22.761]  It's incredible.
[00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:25.723]  Or I say State Department Mirandam 7277.
[00:42:25.723 --> 00:42:28.585]  Wow, that's the whole UN takeover of the world.
[00:42:28.585 --> 00:42:30.867]  I mean, this is all critical.
[00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:46.878]  By the way, speaking of UN takeover of the world, Jack Smith, the former head UN war crimes prosecutor, now he's hired his deputy, another war crimes prosecutor that ran the UN persecution of the Serbs, to be his deputy going after Trump and the criminal prosecutions.
[00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:49.099]  I mean, this is just literally a U.N.
[00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:49.839]  takeover.
[00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:50.299]  The U.N.
[00:42:50.299 --> 00:42:50.840]  with a U.N.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.060]  treaty over our energy.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:52.420]  The U.N.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.242]  with a treaty over our medical care.
[00:42:56.242 --> 00:42:58.263]  I mean, it's just, it's the U.N.
[00:42:58.263 --> 00:43:00.744]  not taking over with soldiers in blue helmets.
[00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:04.406]  Taking over through the corporate bureaucracy, but I digress.
[00:43:05.336 --> 00:43:23.533]  The reason people tune into the show is we give you tomorrow's news today by showing how the globalists have all these different agendas and they admit working in concert to bring you to a post-industrial starvation level to then dictate the terms of your surrender.
[00:43:23.533 --> 00:43:29.919]  So here is the professor talking about the food deserts in San Francisco, in Chicago, in New York.
[00:43:30.805 --> 00:43:41.095]  Where they are purposely defunding the police, purposefully allowing people to commit crimes via the Soros prosecutors that don't even have people arrested now, much less turn them loose.
[00:43:41.095 --> 00:43:45.239]  And it is designed to bring us into a Soviet model.
[00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:51.125]  And now that the criminals like Locus have destroyed the blue cities, they're now moving out into the suburbs.
[00:43:51.705 --> 00:43:58.470]  That's why the globalists want our guns so that their criminals can go out and terrorize us into submission without being resistant.
[00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.293]  And that's why the Second Amendment is so critical on so many levels.
[00:44:02.293 --> 00:44:10.118]  So here's the professor breaking down the food deserts and what's happening in Chicago as Chicago says they're going to set up government stores.
[00:44:10.118 --> 00:44:11.019]  That's right.
[00:44:11.019 --> 00:44:14.661]  I owe my soul to the company store.
[00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:18.304]  This is true slavery and a master plan being rolled out now.
[00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:36.423]  The city of Chicago, as usual, is plumbing innovative depths of clowndom with a proposal to build government grocery stores, since the real grocery stores are fleeing the city due to predatory taxes, predatory mandates, and of course, predatory shoplifters.
[00:44:36.963 --> 00:44:41.725]  Who are doing the hard work of destabilizing American cities to usher in the revolution.
[00:44:41.725 --> 00:44:47.267]  Chicago's mayor exploring the possibility of city-owned grocery stores in some windy city neighborhoods.
[00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:54.510]  Mayor Brandon Johnson believes this will provide relief for communities without quality grocery stores living in those so-called food deserts.
[00:44:54.850 --> 00:45:09.266]  The plan is part of Chicago mayor and unironic socialist Brandon Johnson's quote, whole of government approach to address inequalities, which suggests everything will be free, but then of course everything in Chicago stores is free with a little creativity.
[00:45:09.887 --> 00:45:19.113]  The mayor will be partnering with the Economic Security Project, which is a non-profit, meaning it's government funded, to take over four abandoned Walmarts.
[00:45:19.113 --> 00:45:28.319]  He also hinted that he'll have subsidies from Joe Biden, which means all Americans will get to join in and fund Chicago's whole-of-government approach.
[00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:39.328]  We could see a lot more of this, since it turns out that tolerating industrial scale looting and shoplifting, oddly enough, leads to cities with no grocery stores.
[00:45:39.328 --> 00:45:46.233]  Major chains are already exiting Washington D.C., Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, and of course, San Francisco.
[00:45:46.954 --> 00:45:55.124]  Expect more Looney Tunes from the gang as they try to keep grocery stores without arresting the people burning them.
[00:45:55.124 --> 00:46:00.911]  It is worth noting that the Soviet Union did try this and it got widespread food shortages.
[00:46:00.911 --> 00:46:02.894]  Turns out free stuff means no stuff.
[00:46:03.473 --> 00:46:11.762]  Or, as Milton Friedman put it, quote, if you put the government in charge of the Sahara Desert in five years, there would be a shortage of sand.
[00:46:11.762 --> 00:46:21.472]  Of course, the Soviet Union shot shoplifters, so we can imagine how Soviet grocery stores that welcome shoplifters will turn out.
[00:46:21.472 --> 00:46:23.674]  I would think they could actually just skip
[00:46:24.235 --> 00:46:29.517]  Building the store part of it and just leave the delivery trucks open overnight to move the inventory faster.
[00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:35.480]  Now, Chicago already has failing schools, failing health care, and of course, failing public safety.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:45.225]  And it does all of that with a $538 million budget deficit, which is about to get bigger as Chicago's finest take on the food supply.
[00:46:45.925 --> 00:46:52.689]  The general rule of thumb in government is if you want a problem to get bigger, have the government fix it.
[00:46:52.689 --> 00:46:57.572]  By that rule, it's about to get a lot harder to find food in Chicago.
[00:46:57.572 --> 00:47:03.055]  At some point, you're down to Amazon and Uber Eats, at least until the drivers get robbed enough.
[00:47:03.055 --> 00:47:03.816]  So what's next?
[00:47:03.816 --> 00:47:05.377]  Brought to you by Unchained.
[00:47:05.377 --> 00:47:09.759]  What's next is at some point in theory, voters will rebel.
[00:47:09.759 --> 00:47:11.621]  Alas, America's pockmark
[00:47:12.401 --> 00:47:12.961]  We're good to go.
[00:47:37.346 --> 00:47:39.111]  Hey, we'll be watching.
[00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:39.572]  See you next time.
[00:47:45.399 --> 00:47:55.144]  Mayor of Chicago announced that city-run grocery stores replaced the real ones, fleeing the city due to predatory city government, collapsing social order, and industrial-scale shoplifting.
[00:47:55.144 --> 00:48:01.168]  It's worth noting that the Soviets tried this and got food shortages, and they put shoplifters in the gulag.
[00:48:01.168 --> 00:48:09.052]  Well, the globalist leftists, from King Charles down to the Extinction Rebellion, have said they want to create artificial scarcity, which they're doing.
[00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:14.095]  Chicago already has failing schools, failing healthcare, and of course, failing public safety.
[00:48:14.875 --> 00:48:18.058]  It could get a lot harder to find food in the city.
[00:48:18.058 --> 00:48:23.183]  True, you can always get Uber Eats, at least until the drivers get robbed enough times.
[00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:25.806]  In theory, at some point, the voters rebel.
[00:48:25.806 --> 00:48:31.151]  In reality, many once great American cities, they missed their chance.
[00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:32.673]  Yeah, plus election fraud.
[00:48:32.673 --> 00:48:34.335]  These are all little mini-dictatorships.
[00:48:35.034 --> 00:49:01.908]  Now we're going to shift gears into the last piece of this big puzzle today, and that's the puppet Biden admitting he's broken the border, admitting he told people to immediately surge if he, quote, won the election slash stole the election, and that the answer is capitulating and completely opening the border, and then the feds will come into the cities and federalize them with federal troops, federal grocery stores, and our journey into total slavery will be complete.
[00:49:01.908 --> 00:49:03.869]  Here is Joe Biden just a few days ago.
[00:49:04.924 --> 00:49:12.130]  First, we put in place policies that process people in a fair and fast way.
[00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:18.035]  Second, we're significantly expanding legal pathways for entry so businesses can get the workers they need.
[00:49:18.035 --> 00:49:20.837]  Families don't have to wait for a decade to be together.
[00:49:20.837 --> 00:49:27.823]  I'm also directing my team to make a historic increase in the number of refugees admitted from Latin America.
[00:49:28.834 --> 00:49:34.441]  People fleeing violence and persecution who simply want their kids to have a better life.
[00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:38.326]  Next week, my team will consult with Congress on this plan.
[00:49:38.326 --> 00:49:42.732]  Third, we're supporting states and cities that have seen a surge in immigrants.
[00:49:44.377 --> 00:49:49.838]  We've developed federal experts, deployed them to help train city workers.
[00:49:49.838 --> 00:49:56.340]  We've launched outreach campaigns, helping over a million eligible migrants apply for work permits.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.141]  And we're accelerating the process for work permit applications.
[00:49:59.141 --> 00:50:06.442]  Right now, most migrants have to wait six months after filing a claim before they can go to work.
[00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:07.943]  Only Congress can change that.
[00:50:08.885 --> 00:50:11.986]  But the Secretary of Homeland Security can take extraordinary action.
[00:50:11.986 --> 00:50:21.990]  Yesterday, given the poor conditions in Venezuela, Secretary Mayorkas announced temporary protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans already in this country.
[00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:33.245]  In the same speech that we just played an excerpt of, Joe Biden then blamed Trump for the, quote, border crisis that Biden and the U.N.
[00:50:33.245 --> 00:50:36.367]  directed even before, again, he got selected.
[00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:40.028]  Biden said, if I win, immediately surge the border.
[00:50:40.028 --> 00:50:45.171]  So Biden has now unveiled his plan for the border crisis, fast track processing at the U.S.
[00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:45.411]  border.
[00:50:45.811 --> 00:50:47.872]  Expand illegal pathways for citizenship.
[00:50:47.872 --> 00:50:49.574]  Increase the total number of refugees.
[00:50:49.574 --> 00:50:52.255]  Send money to help the sanctuary cities.
[00:50:52.255 --> 00:50:55.137]  Speed up work permits for illegals.
[00:50:55.137 --> 00:51:09.667]  And of course, organize the illegals into voting blocks and give them driver's licenses, which they're already doing everywhere, while of course denying that they're election meddling in any way as they try to put in jail anyone that points out the open election fraud that's taking place.
[00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.749]  The good news is America's waking up.
[00:51:12.749 --> 00:51:14.831]  The good news is Europe's waking up.
[00:51:14.831 --> 00:51:17.434]  The good news is the globalists admit they're in trouble.
[00:51:17.434 --> 00:51:20.897]  They're even pulling back their ESG operation, at least the name.
[00:51:20.897 --> 00:51:25.241]  So we've got to really push hard here, just like we did with the new lockdowns.
[00:51:25.241 --> 00:51:28.365]  You notice they're having big problems getting it done, even though they've tried.
[00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:30.808]  That's the power of We The People.
[00:51:30.808 --> 00:51:32.711]  That's the power of this broadcast.
[00:51:32.711 --> 00:51:41.645]  That's why I'm asking you now before Owen takes over, Owen Schroyer, to tell everybody you know and don't know and random strangers your email list, your text list, somebody at the 7-Eleven.
[00:51:42.628 --> 00:51:49.251]  Folks at church, whatever, to tune into InfoWars.com forward slash show, the forbidden channel that you're not supposed to look at.
[00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:51.631]  And I see people all over the web promoting us.
[00:51:51.631 --> 00:51:53.912]  We're getting massive numbers of new listeners.
[00:51:53.912 --> 00:51:55.653]  People are hungry for the truth.
[00:51:55.653 --> 00:51:57.514]  So it's really having an effect.
[00:51:57.514 --> 00:51:59.774]  Everybody's doing a great job, including the crew.
[00:51:59.774 --> 00:52:00.775]  Please keep it up.

[00:52:33.539 --> 00:52:33.839]  I don't
[00:52:56.352 --> 00:52:58.034]  Soon to be political prisoner.
[00:52:58.034 --> 00:53:00.436]  That's how serious the situation is.
[00:53:00.436 --> 00:53:02.417]  But we're not giving up.
[00:53:02.417 --> 00:53:04.559]  So the tyranny's blown up in their face.
[00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:06.260]  And if God's with us, who can be against us?
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.243]  I now hand the baton to the great Owen Schroyer.
[00:53:09.243 --> 00:53:17.450]  In a galaxy torn by conflict, where darkness spreads its tendrils across the universe, one hero rises against the immeasurable might of the globalists.
[00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:22.793]  Tune in and trust in the power of the truth to lead us to victory in the Great Infowar.
[00:53:22.793 --> 00:53:27.596]  Prepare for the ultimate battle for truth with today's War Room broadcast.
[00:53:27.596 --> 00:53:31.598]  Now, it's your host, Owen Schroer and his intrepid crew.
[00:53:31.598 --> 00:53:35.701]  Find the show and share the links at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:53:43.388 --> 00:53:52.857]  All right, we are now inside the Info Wars World Headquarters, coming to you live on this Sunday.
[00:53:52.857 --> 00:54:00.845]  And while I do take over the transmission, we are going to be hearing again from Alex on a very serious issue.
[00:54:02.918 --> 00:54:16.723]  A little outside of the lines, if you will, discussing the will to live, the will to survive, and how past civilizations, when they lose that will, that desire, that instinct, they are no more.
[00:54:16.723 --> 00:54:18.784]  They fall.
[00:54:18.784 --> 00:54:23.366]  And so this whole trend going with the fall of Rome, which is ironic,
[00:54:25.023 --> 00:54:40.931]  It's this internet trend where girls ask their boyfriend or their husband or whatever, how often do you think about the Roman Empire, the fall of Rome, but it's this internet trend and nobody really understands what's actually behind it.
[00:54:40.931 --> 00:54:42.772]  Why is the fall of Rome significant?
[00:54:42.772 --> 00:54:45.573]  Why was the Roman Empire even able to fall?
[00:54:47.093 --> 00:54:53.517]  And so Alex is going to break all of that down coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:53.517 --> 00:54:56.800]  And of course I will be with you for InfoWars Sunday Night Live.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.281]  We do intend to take a lot of phone calls.
[00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:02.804]  But let me tell you what we have coming up because this is very important as well.
[00:55:02.804 --> 00:55:10.249]  I'll get a little bit political with you tonight and then Alex is going to get a little bit outside the lines existential if you will.
[00:55:10.249 --> 00:55:11.310]  And then we'll take your phone calls.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:25.265]  There is this looming, quote-unquote, government shutdown, and there's only a few individuals who really understand how to approach this politically.
[00:55:25.265 --> 00:55:33.588]  And that, of course, is Matt Gaetz, who we're going to be hearing from, and then presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:55:33.588 --> 00:55:39.130]  Now, I think Vivek has the complete right attitude on this, saying, why aren't we embracing a government shutdown?
[00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:42.236]  Why aren't we promoting a government shutdown?
[00:55:42.236 --> 00:55:49.438]  When the Democrats lie, and it is a lie, and say, oh, the Republicans are responsible for every government shutdown.
[00:55:49.438 --> 00:55:50.598]  Folks, you can go do the research.
[00:55:50.598 --> 00:55:55.139]  The Democrats have been in control of the House and Congress for multiple government shutdowns.
[00:55:55.139 --> 00:55:56.639]  So they just outright lie to you.
[00:55:56.639 --> 00:55:57.599]  But that's part for the course.
[00:55:57.599 --> 00:56:02.280]  You cannot be a Democrat unless you're willing to lie to the American people.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.340]  It's not even a will.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.740]  You have to lie to the American people.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.541]  They tell you the border is secure.
[00:56:07.541 --> 00:56:08.901]  Joe Biden just set a record
[00:56:09.821 --> 00:56:18.382]  for any presidential administration for most illegal border crossings in a month and then Karine Jean-Pierre tells you the border is secure and Kamala Harris of course is the border czar.
[00:56:18.382 --> 00:56:19.284]  She's never been down there.
[00:56:21.118 --> 00:56:35.285]  But I'm going to play an interview for Matt Gaetz in its entirety because it's important for Matt Gaetz to break this down and it's important for us to give Matt Gaetz a platform right now because the empty suit Mitch McConnell has been beyond a failure.
[00:56:35.285 --> 00:56:39.407]  And I would even argue at this point that he's working for the Democrats.
[00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:43.847]  So we've got a break coming up in 60 seconds.
[00:56:43.847 --> 00:56:45.308]  It's a short break.
[00:56:45.308 --> 00:56:54.017]  Then, in the five minute short segment, I'm going to explain why I believe Mitch McConnell is now working for the Democrats, and perhaps always was.
[00:56:54.017 --> 00:57:03.546]  And then we're going to play a full segment of Matt Gaetz responding to some of the weak-kneed Republicans when it comes to this government shutdown.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.747]  And so to be clear, he's going to be attacking Jim Jordan a little bit here.
[00:57:08.747 --> 00:57:18.302]  Now, I think Jim Jordan's done a lot better than his predecessors when it comes to House oversight and judiciary is concerned, but we're still not where we need to be.
[00:57:19.818 --> 00:57:23.959]  And so Matt Gaetz is putting the pressure and trying to move the ball upfield.
[00:57:23.959 --> 00:57:28.860]  And I'm going to explain all that when we come back from this break, and then we're going to be hearing from Matt Gaetz.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:36.142]  But I'm going to tell you why I think Kevin McCarthy is actually working for Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and the Democrats.
[00:57:36.142 --> 00:57:47.004]  And then you're going to hear from Matt Gaetz on this looming government shutdown, who, as far as I'm concerned, has had the only right take on this from anyone else in Congress, but still not as good as Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:57:49.485 --> 00:57:54.829]  Let me remind you folks to go to InfoWarsStore.com to keep us on the air and in the fight.

[00:59:09.644 --> 00:59:10.826]  It's about to sell out.

[00:59:43.886 --> 00:59:47.208]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:08.609]  When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen darkness.
[01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:15.833]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:17.935]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[01:00:17.935 --> 01:00:23.958]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:28.381]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[01:00:28.661 --> 01:00:33.784]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:37.986]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[01:00:37.986 --> 01:00:46.090]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:52.553]  And now it's Alex Jones, leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.
[01:00:52.553 --> 01:00:57.015]  Tune in at infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:01:04.048 --> 01:01:15.824]  Alright, when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to play an entire interview of Matt Gaetz with Maria Bartiromo, and it's important to give Matt Gaetz the platform here, because A, he's the real leader of the House Republicans.
[01:01:17.116 --> 01:01:22.138]  Kevin McCarthy's proven himself an empty suit, if not working for the Democrats, and I'm going to explain that.
[01:01:22.138 --> 01:01:28.980]  And it's time to build Matt Gaetz's political capital, and you notice that Ronna Romney McDaniel is nowhere to be found.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:42.605]  And so there is no strategizing, there is no leadership in the GOP, and Ronna Romney McDaniel and Kevin McCarthy are responsible for this lack of strategy, this lack of foresight, this lack of vision,
[01:01:43.792 --> 01:01:45.654]  And this lack of action.
[01:01:45.654 --> 01:01:47.855]  So we've got to build Matt Gay's political capital.
[01:01:47.855 --> 01:01:49.196]  He needs to be a household name.
[01:01:49.196 --> 01:01:51.158]  He needs to be the next Speaker of the House.
[01:01:51.158 --> 01:02:02.467]  But let me explain, aside from Ronna Romney McDaniel and the missing in action GOP Chair that she's been, everybody could have seen that coming.
[01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:05.769]  Of course, Mitt Romney is going to be stepping down.
[01:02:05.769 --> 01:02:09.632]  There's a victory for us, but it's time for Ronna Romney McDaniel to be next.
[01:02:10.632 --> 01:02:14.696]  I now believe Kevin McCarthy is working for the Democrat Party.
[01:02:14.696 --> 01:02:20.342]  Now, I didn't want Kevin McCarthy to be Speaker of the House because I anticipated this is exactly how it would go.
[01:02:20.342 --> 01:02:21.464]  But he's been an empty suit.
[01:02:21.464 --> 01:02:23.065]  He hasn't fulfilled any of his promises.
[01:02:24.168 --> 01:02:32.014]  And at first I thought the only reason he was filing articles of impeachment now is because he wanted to gain some points.
[01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:36.297]  He wanted to score some points on the board because he's got a big fat egg.
[01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:41.080]  He's got a big fat zero as far as political points are concerned from Kevin McCarthy.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.422]  He's been an empty suit as Speaker of the House.
[01:02:43.422 --> 01:02:45.423]  And he fought so hard for it!
[01:02:45.423 --> 01:02:47.124]  And he made so many promises!
[01:02:47.124 --> 01:02:48.465]  And what's he done since?
[01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:49.586]  Nothing!
[01:02:49.586 --> 01:02:53.289]  He fought like hell to become Speaker of the House and now he's laid down like a little bitch.
[01:02:55.097 --> 01:03:00.038]  But now I actually think Kevin McCarthy is working for the Democrats.
[01:03:00.038 --> 01:03:03.158]  Let me explain why.
[01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:09.820]  I think it's clear at this point that the American left and the Democrats are ready to move on from Joe Biden.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.160]  Now this is not going to be a smooth transition.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:23.482]  But I think it's pretty clear the media is now coming for Biden and all the Hunter Biden problems and all the Joe Biden quid pro quo problems are going to come home to roost.
[01:03:23.482 --> 01:03:24.202]  It's unavoidable.
[01:03:25.481 --> 01:03:48.605]  Not to mention his physical and mental decline, which is going to get more and more obvious, and the embarrassment on the international stage, which is only going to get even worse with the disrespect and the geopolitical disadvantage that he brings our country.
[01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:51.486]  So, what a perfect time
[01:03:53.089 --> 01:04:03.195]  After all these years for Kevin McCarthy to file articles of impeachment right along when the Democrats are ready to move him out of the way.
[01:04:03.195 --> 01:04:04.836]  Just about all the evidence we needed.
[01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:11.378]  There's been some new evidence coming forward when it comes to the Biden crime family allegations.
[01:04:11.378 --> 01:04:17.881]  But all the evidence was already there for an impeachment inquiry to move forward or a special counsel to move forward.
[01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:20.822]  And Kevin McCarthy did nothing.
[01:04:20.822 --> 01:04:23.483]  So why is he doing it now?
[01:04:23.483 --> 01:04:27.384]  Because the Democrats need some help to get Joe Biden out of the way.
[01:04:27.384 --> 01:04:28.685]  But they don't want to do it themselves.
[01:04:29.585 --> 01:04:31.546]  They want someone else to do it for them.
[01:04:31.546 --> 01:04:35.009]  And in this process, they're going to stab RFK Jr.
[01:04:35.009 --> 01:04:38.572]  in the back, which is only going to hurt them politically.
[01:04:38.572 --> 01:04:41.014]  But that's an entire different issue.
[01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:46.998]  So let's give the real Speaker of the House, let's give the real leader of House Republicans the platform when we come back.
[01:04:46.998 --> 01:04:49.720]  Maria Bartiromo interviews Matt Gaetz.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.762]  I think it's very important to play this.
[01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:54.424]  And we'll respond on the other side.
[01:04:59.815 --> 01:05:04.519]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[01:05:04.519 --> 01:05:06.500]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.542]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:05:08.542 --> 01:05:11.004]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:05:11.004 --> 01:05:11.824]  Hey, what's better?
[01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:12.685]  Knockout.
[01:05:12.685 --> 01:05:14.026]  What's better?
[01:05:14.026 --> 01:05:14.767]  Down-and-out.
[01:05:14.767 --> 01:05:15.287]  What's better?
[01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:17.549]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:22.493]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:05:23.183 --> 01:05:27.148]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:05:27.148 --> 01:05:28.469]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:05:28.469 --> 01:05:29.791]  They're all very diverse.
[01:05:29.791 --> 01:05:39.962]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love, and sold for a lower price, under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:46.327]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[01:05:46.327 --> 01:05:50.870]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.
[01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:54.853]  So get your M4 Wars MD, good night's sleep today, at M4WarsWare.com.
[01:06:05.512 --> 01:06:11.574]  So Kevin McCarthy has been an empty suit as Speaker of the House.
[01:06:11.574 --> 01:06:13.494]  He didn't fulfill any of his promises.
[01:06:13.494 --> 01:06:19.436]  He hasn't been a leader at all, even though he fought for that position so hard.
[01:06:19.436 --> 01:06:23.577]  Tooth and nail, he was scratching to become Speaker of the House, and then he gets it and does what with it?
[01:06:23.577 --> 01:06:25.257]  How about nothing?
[01:06:25.257 --> 01:06:27.178]  Now he wants to score political points.
[01:06:28.058 --> 01:06:41.713]  By launching an impeachment inquiry, but I now believe that's because he's working for the Democrats, and this has been on the Democrats' timetable, that now they want to remove Biden and replace him with either Gavin Newsom, who said he wasn't running, or maybe Big Michael Obama steps in.
[01:06:42.205 --> 01:06:43.546]  No, they don't want RFK Jr.
[01:06:43.546 --> 01:06:44.666]  He's anti-establishment.
[01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:46.587]  He's against the military-industrial complex.
[01:06:46.587 --> 01:06:48.567]  He's against the pharmaceutical-industrial complex.
[01:06:48.567 --> 01:06:51.468]  So their unit party, Corrupt DC, isn't interested in him.
[01:06:51.468 --> 01:06:52.889]  So here's Maria Bartiromo.
[01:06:52.889 --> 01:07:00.172]  Right after interviewing Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz brings the heat on Sunday morning Futures.
[01:07:00.172 --> 01:07:07.334]  Now joining us, one of the people holding up an agreement to fund the government, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz.
[01:07:07.334 --> 01:07:09.435]  Congressman, thank you very much for being here this morning.
[01:07:10.299 --> 01:07:11.079]  Well, thank you.
[01:07:11.079 --> 01:07:17.942]  I'm glad I get to respond to your monologue, because if you're saying that I'm standing in the way of all the Republican wins, I'd love you to enumerate them.
[01:07:17.942 --> 01:07:24.925]  Watching my friend and mentor Jim Jordan, it was quite painful, because he started by saying, we should only pick one fight, the border.
[01:07:24.925 --> 01:07:28.307]  But then as the interview went on, he said, well, we should pick a second fight, Jack Smith.
[01:07:28.647 --> 01:07:39.410]  And by the time the interview rounded out, he was saying that we shouldn't be funding Ukraine without a plan, and yet the very continuing resolution that you and Jim Jordan seem to be for continues to have $300 million more for Ukraine.
[01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.610]  So I think we ought to fight on all fronts.
[01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:49.613]  I think the border is very important, and the best way for us to advance the Republican border policies is to pass the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill.
[01:07:49.613 --> 01:07:53.334]  Do that along with Veterans, Defense, Ag, State and Foreign Ops.
[01:07:53.334 --> 01:07:54.894]  We'll have 73% of the discretionary
[01:07:55.234 --> 01:07:56.054]  We're good to go.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:18.183]  Congressman, I understand and that is why you are on this program this morning because I want to give you a fair shot and I want to get you heard.
[01:08:18.183 --> 01:08:34.108]  So tell me why you are threatening Speaker McCarthy and trying to shut down this government at a time that the Republicans have finally gotten some upper hands here in terms of wins, able to investigate President Biden on what looks like bribery.
[01:08:34.775 --> 01:08:40.876]  Yeah, we don't put our pencils down in the investigation of President Biden during a shutdown, so the premise is false.
[01:08:40.876 --> 01:08:47.517]  Second, if Kevin McCarthy was actually serious about pursuing the Bidens, he would have sent Hunter Biden a subpoena by now.
[01:08:47.517 --> 01:08:51.358]  That's how you know this is sort of failure theater that you're observing.
[01:08:51.358 --> 01:08:55.039]  During the first year of Democrat control of the Congress, they brought in Donald Trump Jr.
[01:08:55.039 --> 01:09:02.340]  three times over nothing, over a nothing burger, and so we seem to be fundamentally unserious in our oversight, but what is serious
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:09.904]  Is the fact that we are spending more than $7 trillion a year, bringing in around $5 trillion a year, and I want to fund the government.
[01:09:09.904 --> 01:09:19.770]  I'm not pro-shutdown, but the way to fund the government is not the same way we've been doing it since the mid-90s, where it's one up-or-down vote on the entire government all at once.
[01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:22.592]  We should have separate, single-subject spending bills.
[01:09:22.592 --> 01:09:25.173]  Kevin McCarthy promised that in January.
[01:09:25.173 --> 01:09:26.914]  He is in breach of that promise.
[01:09:26.914 --> 01:09:29.836]  So I'm not here to hold the government hostage.
[01:09:29.836 --> 01:09:31.677]  I'm here to hold Kevin McCarthy to his word.
[01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:35.693]  Are their Freedom Caucus members also out of compliance?
[01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:38.680]  They were also on the Appropriations Committee.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.426]  Where is the responsibility for them?
[01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:42.728]  Are they also out of compliance?
[01:09:43.678 --> 01:09:45.639]  No, I'm not a member of the Freedom Caucus.
[01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:46.799]  I'll let them speak for themselves.
[01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:48.199]  But take, for example, the border.
[01:09:48.199 --> 01:09:51.580]  This issue, you think, has great primacy, and I would agree with you.
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:10:01.363]  The Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill was passed out of the Appropriations Committee in June, and yet Kevin McCarthy hasn't put it on the floor in more than 100 days.
[01:10:02.783 --> 01:10:04.224]  That is not serious.
[01:10:04.224 --> 01:10:08.466]  You know why Kevin McCarthy didn't move our border appropriations bill?
[01:10:08.466 --> 01:10:30.356]  Because the lobbyists and the special interests who own Kevin McCarthy want to put us in this position where we're backed up against the wall facing shutdown politics and what that does is it centralizes power to the people that they buy off with PAC donations and lobbyist donations and then the membership doesn't get to make real contributions to that process.
[01:10:30.356 --> 01:10:31.577]  I'm trying to democratize it.
[01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.738]  The bills are being worked on.
[01:10:33.738 --> 01:10:41.181]  You just heard Jim Jordan say that they are efforting for bills this week, appropriations bills this week, to get through.
[01:10:41.181 --> 01:10:43.563]  That would partially fund the government.
[01:10:43.563 --> 01:10:47.905]  The defense bill as well, you wanted the defense bill to move forward.
[01:10:47.905 --> 01:10:48.425]  Did you not?
[01:10:49.266 --> 01:10:53.229]  Yes, that's why I voted for it and I voted for the rule to proceed on to it.
[01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:58.553]  And by the way, don't give Kevin McCarthy credit for the fact that we're moving on to these four appropriations bills.
[01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:06.620]  That was the deal that House conservatives foisted upon Kevin McCarthy when he couldn't just move the big spending bills without moving the bills that cut spending.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.363]  We said, no, no, no, you have to move bills like the state and foreign ops bill because
[01:11:10.603 --> 01:11:19.306]  We don't think we should be borrowing money from China to go fund gay pride parades in Prague or LGBTQ seminars in Indonesia.
[01:11:19.306 --> 01:11:21.487]  We don't think that that's a good use of our money.
[01:11:21.487 --> 01:11:24.088]  And the only way to do this, Maria, is line by line.
[01:11:24.088 --> 01:11:28.170]  Kevin wants it in one big up or down vote, keep the government open, shut it down.
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.091]  I'm saying single subject spending bills.
[01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:33.652]  It's the only way to break the fever and liberate ourselves from this out of control spending.
[01:11:33.712 --> 01:11:35.954]  Well, he's doing the four bills next week.
[01:11:35.954 --> 01:11:37.055]  Because we're making him.
[01:11:37.055 --> 01:11:38.056]  Because we're making him.
[01:11:38.056 --> 01:11:38.737]  But he's doing it.
[01:11:38.737 --> 01:11:43.642]  So to push now to blow up all of the wins that you all have had now.
[01:11:43.642 --> 01:11:44.703]  Which wins?
[01:11:44.703 --> 01:11:45.524]  Please enumerate them.
[01:11:45.524 --> 01:11:46.225]  Well, okay.
[01:11:46.225 --> 01:11:53.092]  Well, how about the fact that he has set up a weaponization committee to investigate the DOJ, whether they're involved in a cover-up.
[01:11:53.092 --> 01:11:53.753]  That's process.
[01:11:56.235 --> 01:11:56.875]  Hold on.
[01:11:56.875 --> 01:12:01.379]  How about the fact that he has set up the China Select Committee to keep China to account?
[01:12:01.379 --> 01:12:07.483]  And of course, he has launched this inquiry into impeachment, potentially, for President Biden.
[01:12:07.483 --> 01:12:08.744]  Is that not what you want?
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.480]  None of those things are deliverables.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.461]  Those are steps in a process.
[01:12:13.461 --> 01:12:21.623]  Setting up a committee is an end unto itself only in Washington, D.C.
[01:12:21.623 --> 01:12:25.024]  These committees have done nothing to reduce inflation.
[01:12:25.024 --> 01:12:27.865]  They've done nothing to actually constrain the Biden government.
[01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:33.466]  We can set up committees and have hearings and yell at people, but at the end of the day if we still send the check
[01:12:33.806 --> 01:12:35.827]  To fund a weaponized government?
[01:12:35.827 --> 01:12:40.229]  Having a weaponization subcommittee is little relief to the American people.
[01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:47.952]  And if any of this was serious, we would be sending out subpoenas and compelling process the way the January 6th Committee did.
[01:12:47.952 --> 01:12:49.733]  We should be operating like them.
[01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:52.394]  Instead, we're playing patty cake with the Bidens.
[01:12:52.394 --> 01:12:54.415]  We're allowing them to get away with it.
[01:12:54.415 --> 01:12:55.396]  And we're funding it.
[01:12:55.396 --> 01:12:56.356]  We're sending the money.
[01:12:56.356 --> 01:12:58.497]  If we were serious, use the power of the purse.
[01:12:58.817 --> 01:13:04.760]  The Speaker joined me a week ago and told me that he will, in fact, subpoena Hunter Biden.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.161]  He said at the appropriate time, but let's be clear.
[01:13:07.161 --> 01:13:07.702]  It's been eight months.
[01:13:07.702 --> 01:13:08.482]  We would not know any of this.
[01:13:08.482 --> 01:13:09.582]  When do you think the appropriate time is?
[01:13:09.582 --> 01:13:10.323]  We would not know any of this.
[01:13:10.323 --> 01:13:13.544]  How many months should the American people have to wait before that subpoena is sent?
[01:13:13.544 --> 01:13:13.945]  You tell me.
[01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:18.786]  We would not know anything that we know about the Biden family.
[01:13:18.786 --> 01:13:20.827]  176 suspicious activity reports.
[01:13:20.827 --> 01:13:24.228]  20 shell companies set up while he was vice president.
[01:13:24.228 --> 01:13:25.708]  The whistleblower testimony.
[01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:30.909]  We would not know any of this if not for those committees that he set up exposing all of this.
[01:13:30.909 --> 01:13:32.310]  We just heard from them last week.
[01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.512]  But you have to follow that to its natural conclusion.
[01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:39.815]  It's not enough to expose facts that get people angry and animated.
[01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:43.838]  You then have to follow those facts to a conclusion and to accountability.
[01:13:43.838 --> 01:13:45.699]  You see, that's what Republicans are bad at.
[01:13:45.699 --> 01:13:54.385]  We're great at having the hearings and putting on the performances, but if you're still going to underwrite Biden's debt, which is what Kevin McCarthy did joining with Democrats on the debt limit deal,
[01:13:54.645 --> 01:14:03.629]  And if you're going to join up with Democrats to still fund his government, Merrick Garland will sit there and he'll answer my tough questions, and he'll smirk at me, or he'll obfuscate, and then guess what?
[01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:11.492]  He goes back to the Justice Department, and the coffers are full with money from the American taxpayer that gets turned against the brave patriots in this country.
[01:14:11.492 --> 01:14:13.253]  What about the January 6th tapes?
[01:14:13.253 --> 01:14:15.033]  Kevin Prompto is going to release those.
[01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:16.194]  I'm still waiting.
[01:14:16.194 --> 01:14:20.336]  Well, the January 6th tapes are available to anybody who wants to see them.
[01:14:20.336 --> 01:14:23.377]  He gave them and allowed Tucker Carlson and his team to see them.
[01:14:23.837 --> 01:14:25.638]  It is true!
[01:14:25.638 --> 01:14:28.420]  Maria, they are not available to anyone who wants to see them.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.602]  That is a factual misstatement.
[01:14:30.602 --> 01:14:37.706]  They have been curated for some people in the media and some defense attorneys, but any American cannot see any of the January 6th news.
[01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:38.407]  That is a false statement.
[01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:47.393]  Are you not right now indirectly working with Democrats because you are going to allow Chuck Schumer to come up with a continuing resolution next week to fund the government?
[01:14:47.393 --> 01:14:49.154]  That's what your actions are doing.
[01:14:49.154 --> 01:14:53.357]  That's why some people feel this is a personal vendetta you have against the Speaker.
[01:14:54.265 --> 01:15:03.431]  No, my vendetta is against a Washington system that allows corruption to put the interests of lobbyists and PACs above the interests of the American people.
[01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:07.274]  Kevin McCarthy facilitates that system, and I do deeply resent that.
[01:15:07.274 --> 01:15:09.796]  But I'm not working with Chuck Schumer or any other Democrat.
[01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:14.158]  I am the one working with House Conservatives to require single-subject spending bills.
[01:15:14.158 --> 01:15:14.739]  No, no, no.
[01:15:14.739 --> 01:15:21.083]  You guys criticize me for forcing single-subject spending bills, then you give Kevin McCarthy the credit for doing it.
[01:15:23.985 --> 01:15:25.747]  Let's just lay some other things out.
[01:15:25.747 --> 01:15:29.330]  Now I did a preface to this that explains some of the things Bartiromo said.
[01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:32.573]  Now, Bartiromo is a loyalist to McCarthy and Jim Jordan.
[01:15:32.573 --> 01:15:36.116]  So that's why she's trying to go tit-for-tat there with Matt Gaetz.
[01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:45.513]  But clearly she does not see what's actually going on, and that McCarthy is actually the one working for the Democrats, not Matt Gaetz.
[01:15:45.513 --> 01:15:48.295]  And in fact, I would say it like this.
[01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:57.081]  Matt Gaetz is the future of the Republican Party, and Matt Gaetz's rhetoric is the rhetoric and the actions that the Republican voters want.
[01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:02.612]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:16:02.612 --> 01:16:04.912]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:16:04.912 --> 01:16:08.853]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:16:08.853 --> 01:16:17.776]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:16:17.776 --> 01:16:25.558]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:16:26.596 --> 01:16:30.200]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:36.026]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:16:36.026 --> 01:16:39.070]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:47.299]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:52.285]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at MFortwore.com.
[01:16:52.285 --> 01:16:57.253]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to MFortwore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:16:57.253 --> 01:16:58.014]  Please take action now.

[01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:43.239]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:15.453 --> 01:20:19.616]  Back here live at the Infowars World Headquarters for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.616 --> 01:20:40.431]  I want to follow up with one thing that Matt Gaetz talked about and that's this, that's this bill to fund Homeland Security and protect the border that Kevin McCarthy's been stalling on and the Democrats are even calling him out for that because not every Democrat wants an open border and I'm gonna have that for you coming up but let's just follow it up a little bit here.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:52.988]  Again, understand, Maria Bartiromo is a loyalist to Jim Jordan and Kevin McCarthy, because they give her inside scoops and they give her their time whenever she asks for it.
[01:20:52.988 --> 01:20:54.569]  So that's fine.
[01:20:54.569 --> 01:21:03.295]  And overall, Maria Bartiromo is probably in the top tier, I'd say top 90 percentile, when it comes to cable news hosts.
[01:21:03.295 --> 01:21:04.696]  So that's fine.
[01:21:04.696 --> 01:21:06.517]  Maria Bartiromo is not the problem here.
[01:21:06.517 --> 01:21:10.840]  And quite frankly, even the back and forth, I think, was healthy there.
[01:21:12.279 --> 01:21:14.401]  Everything Matt Gaetz says is spot on.
[01:21:14.401 --> 01:21:29.371]  The only place where Matt Gaetz could go further would be embracing the government shutdown and saying, why should we fund this corrupt, out-of-control government that's weaponized against the American people and even more corrupted by Joe Biden?
[01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:30.612]  But he doesn't want to go there?
[01:21:30.612 --> 01:21:32.994]  Fine.
[01:21:32.994 --> 01:21:34.455]  But everything he's talking about is true.
[01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:47.049]  And for Maria Bartiromo to not see through her loyalty to Kevin McCarthy is unfortunate.
[01:21:47.049 --> 01:21:53.034]  Because she talks about, but he's waiting for the right time, but he's done this to the Biden and that to the Biden.
[01:21:53.034 --> 01:21:54.515]  Really, how have the Bidens suffered at all?
[01:21:56.684 --> 01:21:59.825]  Because in my view, it's the American people that have suffered.
[01:21:59.825 --> 01:22:03.587]  In my view, it's the American economy that has suffered.
[01:22:03.587 --> 01:22:07.369]  In my view, it's America's standing in the world that has suffered.
[01:22:07.369 --> 01:22:08.650]  Not Joe Biden.
[01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:10.591]  Not Hunter Biden.
[01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:12.111]  They're doing just fine!
[01:22:12.111 --> 01:22:15.513]  Joe Biden spends 40% of his time as president on vacation.
[01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:17.154]  In fact, let me check the clock here.
[01:22:17.154 --> 01:22:21.796]  Sunday, 5.22 Central Time, Joe Biden is on vacation right now.
[01:22:23.049 --> 01:22:26.571]  Don't tell me Joe Biden is feeling the heat from Kevin McCarthy.
[01:22:26.571 --> 01:22:30.432]  That's a joke!
[01:22:30.432 --> 01:22:42.078]  And all that information that Maria Bartiromo laid out there was all available before Kevin McCarthy became Speaker of the House.
[01:22:42.078 --> 01:22:44.619]  All of it.
[01:22:44.619 --> 01:22:46.500]  Now, they've been able to go into bank records
[01:22:47.861 --> 01:22:49.602]  And that's the one difference.
[01:22:49.602 --> 01:23:02.349]  But all the text messages, all the whistleblowers, all the business transactions, that has all been publicly available before Kevin McCarthy became Speaker of the House.
[01:23:02.349 --> 01:23:04.089]  Oh, he's just waiting for the right time.
[01:23:04.089 --> 01:23:06.831]  I think you're right about that, Maria.
[01:23:06.831 --> 01:23:08.512]  I think you're right about that.
[01:23:08.512 --> 01:23:10.413]  He has been waiting for the right time.
[01:23:10.413 --> 01:23:14.335]  The right time for the Democrats to get Joe Biden out of the way.
[01:23:15.509 --> 01:23:18.170]  That's why Kevin McCarthy's moving forward with it now.
[01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:31.673]  I originally thought, well, Kevin McCarthy's just moving forward now because he needs to score some political points because he's been Speaker for almost two years and he's still got an egg on the board.
[01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:34.414]  He's still got a donut on his scoreboard.
[01:23:34.414 --> 01:23:37.815]  So he wanted to score some political points in his moment of desperation.
[01:23:37.815 --> 01:23:40.116]  No, I was wrong, actually, I will say.
[01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:41.216]  I believe I was wrong.
[01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:44.377]  I believe Kevin McCarthy is doing this because that's what Chuck Schumer
[01:23:45.236 --> 01:23:54.987]  That's what Nancy Pelosi and that's what the Democrat Party establishment, maybe even Barack Obama, wants Kevin McCarthy to do.
[01:23:54.987 --> 01:23:58.290]  Because we've all seen the media now turn on Biden.
[01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:00.993]  We've all seen the poll numbers in for Biden.
[01:24:00.993 --> 01:24:01.534]  Look at that.
[01:24:01.534 --> 01:24:02.675]  Top page of Drudge Report.
[01:24:02.675 --> 01:24:03.776]  Trump leads Biden 52-42 in polls.
[01:24:06.218 --> 01:24:09.699]  It's over for Joe Biden and the Democrats know it.
[01:24:09.699 --> 01:24:14.179]  So Kevin McCarthy is doing their bidding and taking Biden out for them.
[01:24:14.179 --> 01:24:15.940]  And that way they don't have to do it.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:27.262]  So it doesn't look like they're a disaster or they're engaging in infighting while they are completely ignoring and snubbing the real Democrat presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.522]  But Matt Gage brought up a bill.
[01:24:29.522 --> 01:24:33.683]  I want to show you that bill that Kevin McCarthy's been sitting on for over 100 days to protect the border.
[01:24:33.683 --> 01:24:35.343]  And so here it is in clip seven.
[01:24:38.462 --> 01:24:40.323]  Well, let me take a step back.
[01:24:40.323 --> 01:24:46.228]  I take it you would describe the situation on our southern border as urgent?
[01:24:46.228 --> 01:24:48.329]  Yes.
[01:24:48.329 --> 01:24:51.071]  And I don't think you'd be alone in that view.
[01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:57.916]  When did the Homeland Security Subcommittee hold hearings on this bill that we're considering today?
[01:24:57.916 --> 01:24:59.517]  My understanding is you held a lot of hearings.
[01:24:59.517 --> 01:25:02.919]  Right, and I believe we passed it in the full committee in July.
[01:25:02.919 --> 01:25:07.703]  You passed it, would June 21st of this year sound about right?
[01:25:08.715 --> 01:25:11.116]  That the full committee marked up your bill?
[01:25:11.116 --> 01:25:13.878]  I'll defer to you, sir, if you have the date there.
[01:25:13.878 --> 01:25:26.744]  I know that I've been working on it since the day I was appointed as chairman with my dear friend Henry Cuellar to try to find better ways to implement a strategy to contain what's happening at the border because it's a national shame.
[01:25:26.744 --> 01:25:28.925]  And I, for one, want to say I appreciate your commitment.
[01:25:28.925 --> 01:25:32.107]  The question I have is why has it taken a hundred days
[01:25:33.066 --> 01:25:38.529]  For the Homeland Security Subcommittee and the Full Appropriations Committee to bring this bill to the Rules Committee.
[01:25:38.529 --> 01:25:43.873]  If the situation on the southern border is as urgent as you and I both believe it is.
[01:25:43.873 --> 01:25:51.957]  Well, I certainly agree that if I was running this place, I'd prioritize things perhaps in a different way.
[01:25:51.957 --> 01:25:53.018]  Are you running the place?
[01:25:53.018 --> 01:25:54.779]  Who is in charge?
[01:25:54.779 --> 01:25:56.140]  Do I talk to the Republican whip?
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.041]  Do I talk to Speaker McCarthy?
[01:25:58.041 --> 01:25:59.242]  Who do I ask this question of?
[01:25:59.502 --> 01:26:05.805]  Well, the appropriations process normally takes place during, we have our field hearings throughout the first six months of the year.
[01:26:05.805 --> 01:26:06.285]  Sure.
[01:26:06.285 --> 01:26:11.507]  July, generally, as we have processed ten of our twelve bills, the other two should get done shortly.
[01:26:11.507 --> 01:26:12.408]  You did your work.
[01:26:12.408 --> 01:26:14.989]  June 21st, you finished, you marked up the bill.
[01:26:14.989 --> 01:26:17.190]  June 21st was a hundred days ago.
[01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:18.370]  Correct.
[01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:21.592]  That's all I'm trying to ask, is what happened in this intervening hundred days?
[01:26:21.592 --> 01:26:23.913]  Why didn't we take up this bill last month?
[01:26:23.913 --> 01:26:24.873]  Or maybe in July?
[01:26:24.873 --> 01:26:25.634]  I don't...
[01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:30.734]  I'm ready to go on June 22nd, sir, but I don't dictate the schedule.
[01:26:30.734 --> 01:26:33.456]  Do you understand why the American people would be frustrated?
[01:26:33.456 --> 01:26:34.597]  Kevin McCarthy's holding it up.
[01:26:34.597 --> 01:26:38.020]  As they see a Republican caucus that can...
[01:26:39.002 --> 01:26:47.629]  Reports and states that the situation on our southern border is urgent but waits a hundred days to bring a homeland security funding bill to the House floor.
[01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:51.092]  Would that make sense, Mr. Spohn?
[01:26:51.092 --> 01:26:52.673]  Of course, yes sir.
[01:26:52.673 --> 01:27:06.043]  Because I think the American people are completely frustrated because you know if you look at it, I remember, I think it was my dear friend Mario Díaz-Balart who had presidents of the countries he's talked about before who came here in 14 and 15 who said we want our children.
[01:27:06.043 --> 01:27:07.364]  We want them to stay home.
[01:27:07.364 --> 01:27:07.885]  We wish the
[01:27:08.285 --> 01:27:12.986]  The President, at that time, President Obama, would say, you're not welcome here.
[01:27:12.986 --> 01:27:18.167]  And when he did that, when he started deporting people and pushing back on the entry, guess what?
[01:27:18.167 --> 01:27:19.248]  The numbers went down.
[01:27:19.248 --> 01:27:20.408]  And they stayed down.
[01:27:20.408 --> 01:27:24.609]  But this administration, from day one, has said there's a green light here.
[01:27:24.609 --> 01:27:25.529]  Please come.
[01:27:25.529 --> 01:27:30.590]  Now talking about giving Venezuelans cards and wishing they could work in this country and stay in this country.
[01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:33.551]  And they don't care whether or not these people are coming across the border.
[01:27:33.551 --> 01:27:35.792]  You can't call what's happening down there Christian.
[01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.072]  You cannot call it humane.
[01:27:37.632 --> 01:27:43.936]  The journey these people are taking to come to freedom is not fair to anyone, and the American people are having to pay for it.
[01:27:43.936 --> 01:27:46.058]  And I can tell you're passionate.
[01:27:46.058 --> 01:28:01.288]  And again, as I said, Mr. Joyce, Mr. Chairman, I understand your passion, I understand your commitment, and I understand that your subcommittee did its job working with Mr. Cuellar, holding a series of hearings earlier this year, and the Appropriations Committee.
[01:28:01.288 --> 01:28:05.131]  I have substantive disagreements which we'll go through with respect to this particular bill.
[01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:07.592]  The committee marked up the bill.
[01:28:07.592 --> 01:28:25.798]  And my point, that I'm simply trying to better understand, I suppose, or the question that I am trying to reconcile in my mind, is why the House Republican majority decided to spend the summer on bills regarding gas stoves and the lesser prairie chicken, and then send everyone home for a 47 day recess
[01:28:27.659 --> 01:28:29.981]  Kevin McCarthy!
[01:28:29.981 --> 01:28:31.562]  Kevin McCarthy!
[01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:33.864]  Say his name!
[01:28:33.864 --> 01:28:41.650]  So, there you go.
[01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:46.193]  I just wanted to give a little more clarity to what Matt Gaetz was talking about, but that's a perfect example.
[01:28:46.193 --> 01:28:47.514]  Oh, who's holding this bill up?
[01:28:47.514 --> 01:28:50.236]  Why is it getting scheduled?
[01:28:50.236 --> 01:28:53.439]  Because Kevin McCarthy, that's why!
[01:28:53.439 --> 01:28:54.980]  Get him out!
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.600]  Get him out!
[01:28:58.353 --> 01:29:07.965]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:29:07.965 --> 01:29:13.272]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:29:13.692 --> 01:29:15.393]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:29:15.393 --> 01:29:18.355]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:29:18.355 --> 01:29:19.996]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:29:19.996 --> 01:29:24.919]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:29:24.919 --> 01:29:26.640]  This is something you need now.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:31.223]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[01:29:31.223 --> 01:29:36.946]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:29:36.946 --> 01:29:43.110]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:44.852]  And air filtration.
[01:29:44.852 --> 01:29:47.517]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:29:47.517 --> 01:29:48.819]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:29:48.819 --> 01:29:51.703]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:29:51.703 --> 01:29:55.609]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:29:58.609 --> 01:30:05.395]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[01:30:05.395 --> 01:30:09.038]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[01:30:09.038 --> 01:30:18.546]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:19.727]  It's about to sell out.
[01:30:19.727 --> 01:30:21.229]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:23.150]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[01:30:57.715 --> 01:30:59.116]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:30:59.116 --> 01:31:00.076]  I thought it was next week.
[01:31:00.076 --> 01:31:04.497]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:31:04.497 --> 01:31:06.717]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:10.558]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:31:10.558 --> 01:31:12.459]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:31:12.459 --> 01:31:16.620]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.820]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:25.420]  Right to the top with these 95% Cucuminoids.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:29.622]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:31:29.622 --> 01:31:32.304]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:31:32.304 --> 01:31:36.226]  This is 95%.
[01:31:36.226 --> 01:31:41.068]  Super constant, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:31:41.068 --> 01:31:42.549]  It's that powerful.
[01:31:42.549 --> 01:31:43.710]  Or more!
[01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:45.831]  So they're available at infowarrestore.com.
[01:31:47.236 --> 01:31:49.798]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:31:49.798 --> 01:31:51.019]  Sold out for almost 8 months.
[01:31:51.019 --> 01:31:57.223]  Back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:57.223 --> 01:31:58.944]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:31:58.944 --> 01:31:59.885]  I thought it was next week.
[01:31:59.885 --> 01:32:04.307]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:32:04.307 --> 01:32:06.549]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:32:06.549 --> 01:32:10.392]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:12.273]  Overhead shot please.
[01:32:12.273 --> 01:32:14.875]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:32:16.428 --> 01:32:19.370]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:25.235]  Right to the top with these 95% Cucuminoids.
[01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:29.419]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:32:29.419 --> 01:32:32.121]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:32:32.121 --> 01:32:33.102]  This is 95%.
[01:32:33.102 --> 01:32:37.005]  Super concentrated.
[01:32:37.005 --> 01:32:40.888]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:42.369]  It's that powerful.
[01:32:42.369 --> 01:32:43.530]  Or more!
[01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:45.652]  So they're available at infowarstore.com.
[01:32:47.045 --> 01:32:49.606]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:32:49.606 --> 01:33:00.671]  Pulled out for almost eight months, back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:33:00.671 --> 01:33:06.574]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.281 --> 01:33:18.586]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:18.586 --> 01:33:32.277]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.277 --> 01:33:34.679]  Alright, we've got big information coming up from Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.679 --> 01:33:38.022]  He has filed a special report on the fall of the West.
[01:33:39.053 --> 01:33:58.083]  And he's going to be exposing some geopolitical information that the American media will ignore, tied into a historical lesson that he feels is imperative for us to learn here on this Sunday evening.
[01:33:58.083 --> 01:34:05.867]  Now, we have some of the most important guests that come on our transmissions.
[01:34:07.606 --> 01:34:11.510]  And there are going to be more important guests coming up this week.
[01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:19.017]  And they break some of the most key information when it comes to the media, and it's way ahead of its time.
[01:34:19.017 --> 01:34:19.498]  Every time.
[01:34:20.765 --> 01:34:23.806]  And so that's why it's important for InfoWars to stay on air.
[01:34:23.806 --> 01:34:35.171]  And that's why the globalists and the corrupt politicians and the deep state and the corrupted social media companies, big tech companies, want us off the air.
[01:34:35.171 --> 01:34:38.933]  When there's big breaking news, they want to control the narrative.
[01:34:38.933 --> 01:34:41.274]  And if InfoWars is on the air, they can't do that.
[01:34:41.274 --> 01:34:47.017]  That's why they are trying so hard to shut us down with all the attacks they've had against Alex Jones.
[01:34:47.017 --> 01:34:49.238]  And now they're in attempt to imprison me.
[01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:55.756]  So your continued support of InfoWarsTore.com maintains us here on the air.
[01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:56.696]  You're our sponsors.
[01:34:56.696 --> 01:34:58.338]  We don't have big Hollywood sponsors.
[01:34:58.338 --> 01:35:00.420]  We don't have big pharmaceutical sponsors.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.382]  We don't have big fast food sponsors.
[01:35:02.382 --> 01:35:02.763]  None of that.
[01:35:03.786 --> 01:35:05.147]  We just have you.
[01:35:05.147 --> 01:35:07.267]  Shopping at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:07.267 --> 01:35:16.451]  And we make it easy because we have things that you need on our site, like toothpaste, and emergency food supplies, and water filters.
[01:35:16.451 --> 01:35:25.115]  And then we have things that we promote to help you live a happy and healthy life, like DNA Force Plus, bodies, and the Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:35:25.115 --> 01:35:27.996]  These are three supplements that I always have in my pantry.
[01:35:29.764 --> 01:35:35.633]  And now, in the Trifecta Pack, you can get all three 40% off.
[01:35:35.633 --> 01:35:37.836]  And look, I can tell you about each one of these products.
[01:35:39.028 --> 01:35:40.969]  Because I'm a product of these products.
[01:35:40.969 --> 01:35:45.831]  And so most people will have to read off of a script to tell you about the products they promote.
[01:35:45.831 --> 01:35:47.432]  Not me, because I know all about them.
[01:35:47.432 --> 01:35:49.173]  The Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:35:49.173 --> 01:35:50.213]  Here's why this is important.
[01:35:50.213 --> 01:35:51.594]  Vitamin K, very important.
[01:35:51.594 --> 01:35:52.634]  Most people are deficient.
[01:35:52.634 --> 01:35:54.135]  You're probably not getting it in your diet.
[01:35:54.135 --> 01:35:55.856]  It's in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:35:55.856 --> 01:35:57.256]  And then the Pregnenolone.
[01:35:57.256 --> 01:36:01.318]  Again, most people don't even know about Pregnenolone and why it's so important.
[01:36:01.318 --> 01:36:07.521]  And the Pregnenolone actually in the Real Red Pill Plus works supplementally and complementary with
[01:36:08.717 --> 01:36:09.598]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:36:09.598 --> 01:36:17.244]  But there's one other thing in the real Red Pill Plus, and that's naturally occurring caffeine because of some of the other ingredients.
[01:36:17.244 --> 01:36:20.567]  So it does have a little caffeine boost, a little energy boost in there for you as well.
[01:36:20.567 --> 01:36:29.113]  Then there's DNA Force Plus with the CoQ10 and the PQQ for telomere support and cellular energy production.
[01:36:29.113 --> 01:36:31.275]  And then there's BOD-Ease with the 95% curcuminoid
[01:36:34.417 --> 01:36:34.557]  Sure.
[01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:59.159]  So you can go to Infowarsstore.com and read all about it for yourself.
[01:36:59.159 --> 01:37:08.386]  Go read the hundreds of five-star reviews, not just on bodies, but all three of those products, now 40% off in the Trifecta pack.
[01:37:08.386 --> 01:37:11.749]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[01:37:11.749 --> 01:37:16.833]  Now, I give a big round of applause to Matt Gaetz.
[01:37:16.833 --> 01:37:21.938]  The only knock I would have against him would be that I think he should embrace the government shutdown.
[01:37:23.288 --> 01:37:30.253]  He should say, hey, you know what, first of all, the Democrats are lying when they say the Republicans have been in charge of every government shutdown.
[01:37:30.253 --> 01:37:31.814]  That's just an outright lie.
[01:37:31.814 --> 01:37:33.315]  It's provable.
[01:37:33.315 --> 01:37:38.799]  Like, the Democrats pretend like there's no historical records, or like you can't go back and research things on the internet.
[01:37:38.799 --> 01:37:41.520]  But whatever, like I said, it's part of the fiber of being a Democrat.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.582]  You have to be a liar.
[01:37:44.582 --> 01:37:48.045]  Or, if you're RFK Jr., they'll make sure that you never get into office.
[01:37:51.425 --> 01:37:54.886]  So, Vivek Ramaswamy, he understands this.
[01:37:54.886 --> 01:38:02.368]  He understands that the right rhetoric and the right political move that resonates with the American people is to embrace the shutdown.
[01:38:02.368 --> 01:38:05.329]  Who likes government?
[01:38:05.329 --> 01:38:06.649]  Seriously!
[01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:13.111]  Sure, you've got libtards out there that just pretend to like whatever they're fed, whatever slop the mainstream puts on their plate.
[01:38:13.111 --> 01:38:17.272]  They just embrace it, mostly because they just hate you and want to be contrarian to you.
[01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:21.446]  But really, at their heart, at their soul, who likes government?
[01:38:21.446 --> 01:38:23.327]  Who wants government in their lives?
[01:38:23.327 --> 01:38:26.928]  And interrupting their lives?
[01:38:26.928 --> 01:38:28.609]  And determining their outcomes?
[01:38:28.609 --> 01:38:33.011]  So really, the response should be, good, shut down this government that's weaponized against the American people.
[01:38:33.011 --> 01:38:36.252]  Shut down this government that steals our money and gives it to foreign countries.
[01:38:36.252 --> 01:38:40.774]  Shut down this government that cares more about illegal immigrants than American citizens.
[01:38:40.774 --> 01:38:42.255]  That resonates with the American people.
[01:38:42.255 --> 01:38:44.015]  So Matt Gaetz doesn't want to go that far.
[01:38:44.015 --> 01:38:45.256]  Maybe it's for political reasons.
[01:38:45.256 --> 01:38:47.497]  Maybe he just doesn't want to have that rhetoric as a member of Congress.
[01:38:48.632 --> 01:38:53.078]  But Vivek Ramaswamy has gone that far in so many words.
[01:38:53.078 --> 01:38:57.624]  But he also goes one other place that I love to see.
[01:38:57.624 --> 01:39:05.454]  Talking about the government lying to us on the Full Send podcast, here's Vivek Ramaswamy in clip number 8.
[01:39:07.009 --> 01:39:08.812]  How old are you guys actually?
[01:39:08.812 --> 01:39:08.872]  29.
[01:39:08.872 --> 01:39:09.453]  You're 29?
[01:39:09.453 --> 01:39:09.913]  Same age.
[01:39:09.913 --> 01:39:10.755]  Same, okay.
[01:39:10.755 --> 01:39:12.477]  I'm 38, a little bit older than you guys.
[01:39:12.477 --> 01:39:20.048]  But certainly I grew up, and I think you guys did too, into a generation where the government has systematically lied to us.
[01:39:21.363 --> 01:39:23.584]  Lie to us about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:39:23.584 --> 01:39:26.807]  We've always not trusted the government in our... Oh yeah, and even conservative.
[01:39:26.807 --> 01:39:28.448]  I mean, Republican, Democrat.
[01:39:28.448 --> 01:39:29.588]  The Iraq War.
[01:39:29.588 --> 01:39:31.109]  The 2008 bailouts.
[01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:32.810]  I was working a job in New York City here.
[01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:33.751]  I mean, that was a farce.
[01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:36.513]  The bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis.
[01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:39.495]  The Trump-Russia collusion hoax that never was.
[01:39:39.495 --> 01:39:41.836]  Origin of COVID-19 pandemic.
[01:39:41.836 --> 01:39:45.239]  What we knew about the vaccines before they were foisted on us as mandates.
[01:39:45.939 --> 01:39:49.080]  The Hunter Biden laptop story on the eve of an election.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:53.441]  The Nashville transgender shooter manifesto that they still have not released.
[01:39:53.441 --> 01:39:55.982]  Now, how our money is being spent in Ukraine.
[01:39:55.982 --> 01:40:02.483]  We have a government that has systematically lied and said, we can't trust the people with the truth.
[01:40:02.483 --> 01:40:10.565]  And so young people who grew up into that generation, I mean, what a four-year college degree is worth, that you take on that debt, somehow that's going to help you live the American dream.
[01:40:10.565 --> 01:40:12.806]  Many of my peers still haven't paid off their college debts.
[01:40:15.003 --> 01:40:18.626]  So yeah, I get it why young people are disaffected.
[01:40:18.626 --> 01:40:26.792]  Boy, I gotta tell ya, you know, I remain consistent in my vote right now being for Donald Trump again.
[01:40:26.792 --> 01:40:39.041]  Some people will disagree with that, might call me a fool, but I believe he's got a second term, he's earned it, and maybe I do believe that he's gonna have his redemption arc if he can get into office again.
[01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:44.345]  But I gotta tell ya, the more I see, the more I hear from Vivek, he just keeps warming my heart.
[01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:49.231]  He just keeps softening my heart and warming my heart to him.
[01:40:49.231 --> 01:40:52.914]  And really, the only reason I wouldn't vote for him is just because he doesn't have any political capital yet.
[01:40:52.914 --> 01:41:02.440]  But, man, his stance on just about everything is just spot-on, organic, and right, in my view.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:08.103]  And he's the only one that said, why aren't we taking what the Democrats give us here?
[01:41:08.103 --> 01:41:12.927]  Let's own the government shutdown, and let's actually shut this corruption down!
[01:41:12.927 --> 01:41:14.548]  He's the only one I've seen go that far.
[01:41:15.529 --> 01:41:18.732]  Now, here's an interesting thing.
[01:41:18.732 --> 01:41:22.055]  Donald Trump had a big record skip last week.
[01:41:22.055 --> 01:41:27.079]  And I don't know why... I mean, look, I understand why people go on Megyn Kelly.
[01:41:27.079 --> 01:41:28.000]  She's got a platform.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.804]  But why Donald Trump would go back on Megyn Kelly is just beyond me.
[01:41:32.804 --> 01:41:35.827]  I mean, how many times has she stabbed the person in the back that she's interviewing?
[01:41:38.752 --> 01:41:40.914]  He hurt himself when he talked about abortion.
[01:41:40.914 --> 01:41:44.356]  And that was a big record skip for him.
[01:41:44.356 --> 01:41:46.597]  And now the Democrats are coming to his aid.
[01:41:46.597 --> 01:41:56.804]  And so after Trump basically kind of backed off his abortion stance, the Democrats are now pushing him right back to the full-on abortion victories that he's had.
[01:41:56.804 --> 01:41:58.305]  This is the Democrats.
[01:41:58.305 --> 01:42:05.650]  Joe Biden tweeted out this video of Donald Trump after he was like, well, maybe we should have six weeks or eight weeks or a heartbeat thing.
[01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:07.572]  A lot of Republicans took that the wrong way.
[01:42:08.959 --> 01:42:18.241]  Political peers took that the wrong way, cultural peers put that the wrong way, but now the Democrats put out this video saying Trump is the king of banning abortion.
[01:42:18.241 --> 01:42:20.582]  I got rid of Roe v. Wade.
[01:42:20.582 --> 01:42:23.182]  I'm the one that got rid of Roe v. Wade.
[01:42:23.182 --> 01:42:25.823]  I was able to do it, and I was very honored to do it.
[01:42:25.823 --> 01:42:28.843]  Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?
[01:42:28.843 --> 01:42:30.304]  The answer is that
[01:42:31.374 --> 01:42:33.096]  There has to be some form of punishment.
[01:42:33.096 --> 01:42:33.756]  For the woman?
[01:42:33.756 --> 01:42:34.957]  Yeah, there has to be some form.
[01:42:34.957 --> 01:42:40.942]  There, of course, remains a vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn life.
[01:42:40.942 --> 01:42:45.186]  Nobody has ever done more for a right to life than Donald Trump.
[01:42:45.186 --> 01:42:46.607]  Roe v. Wade, they won.
[01:42:46.607 --> 01:42:47.728]  They finally won.
[01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:53.413]  The Iowa bill was signed and they wouldn't have been able to do anything if I wasn't able to do what I did.
[01:42:53.413 --> 01:42:56.276]  So Democrats restoring some of the damage Trump did to himself.
[01:42:56.276 --> 01:42:57.057]  That's hilarious.
[01:42:58.789 --> 01:42:59.570]  Lie down and take it.

[01:45:58.553 --> 01:46:04.296]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:46:04.296 --> 01:46:09.139]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:46:09.139 --> 01:46:12.160]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:21.745]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[01:47:10.367 --> 01:47:14.711]  Welcome back to the final segment of the Sunday night edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.711 --> 01:47:16.992]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.992 --> 01:47:26.240]  Please don't forget, coming up when this hour ends, in about ten and a half minutes, Owen Shore will be taking over yet again to host Sunday Night Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:31.024]  Central, with a lot of breaking news, clips, analysis, and your phone calls.
[01:47:31.024 --> 01:47:33.206]  Now, I'm about to cover in this last segment
[01:47:33.826 --> 01:47:37.331]  The most important issue happening on our planet today.
[01:47:37.331 --> 01:47:46.544]  I think hands down you'll agree with me and we have a chance to control our destiny and not march headlong into nuclear Armageddon.
[01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:48.127]  So let's get into it right now.
[01:47:48.953 --> 01:47:50.774]  Facts are stubborn things.
[01:48:19.193 --> 01:48:19.513]  We're good.
[01:48:40.569 --> 01:48:41.329]  Let's be clear.
[01:48:41.329 --> 01:48:42.910]  Russia's not perfect.
[01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:44.511]  They're not without sin either.
[01:48:44.511 --> 01:48:51.393]  But they are not expansionary like the Anglo-American globalists allied with Communist China.
[01:48:51.393 --> 01:48:54.995]  But now China's breaking with that and teaming up with Russia.
[01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:59.656]  And if you talk about anything on the earth that's as evil as the globalists, it's the Communist Chinese.
[01:48:59.656 --> 01:49:08.960]  So the Russians aren't perfect, but compared to the globalists and the Communist Chinese, they are like choirboys in my research view and opinion.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:11.621]  So what did Lavrov talk about?
[01:49:11.621 --> 01:49:13.462]  What's the big takeaway?
[01:49:13.462 --> 01:49:16.563]  He said the West is losing its survival instinct.
[01:49:16.563 --> 01:49:31.129]  He said the West is losing its connection to reality and the fact that this is an existential threat to all life on Earth and they don't realize how much danger everyone is in because they basically have a
[01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:42.936]  Bias, a normalcy bias of being in charge and having the power and being the controlling empire since the end of World War II, 70 plus years ago.
[01:49:42.936 --> 01:49:45.318]  And that's the point I make all the time.
[01:49:45.318 --> 01:49:48.820]  The globalists are getting more and more reckless, more and more out of control.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:51.261]  The more they squeeze people, the more resistance they get.
[01:49:51.261 --> 01:49:56.605]  Instead of backing off and using soft power, they use hard power.
[01:49:56.605 --> 01:50:01.508]  And now they've run up against the largest nuclear power on Earth, who's saying they're not going to back down.
[01:50:02.335 --> 01:50:03.435]  This is a game of chicken.
[01:50:03.435 --> 01:50:21.303]  We don't want to play, especially when the people who've hijacked our country and Europe are diametrically opposed to us as much as they're opposed to the Russians, because any independent sovereign culture is a threat to their hegemonic technocracy and transhumanist aims and depopulationist goals.
[01:50:21.303 --> 01:50:23.084]  Russian official slams U.S.
[01:50:23.084 --> 01:50:23.264]  for
[01:50:24.395 --> 01:50:37.909]  Stirring up conflicts that actively divide humanity into hostile blocks and prevent it from achieving common goals, close quote, says Western nations are sending arms to Kiev and training its troops.
[01:50:37.909 --> 01:50:44.356]  They are de facto fighting against us with the hands and bodies of Ukrainians.
[01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:47.971]  Yes, they'll fight to the last Ukrainian, NATO will.
[01:50:47.971 --> 01:51:03.135]  The world has a chance to achieve authentic democratization in international relations by establishing a multipolar order, making the first opportunity since the end of World War II, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the UN General Assembly.
[01:51:03.135 --> 01:51:05.215]  It's actually on Saturday, I'd said Friday.
[01:51:05.215 --> 01:51:08.736]  The US and its Western allies seek to prevent such a development.
[01:51:09.216 --> 01:51:09.616]  That's a quote.
[01:51:35.186 --> 01:51:37.767]  Intractability in any negotiations.
[01:51:37.767 --> 01:51:41.128]  Washington and his allies keep making promises left and right.
[01:51:41.128 --> 01:51:46.169]  They don't just look down on the third world or the old world, they look down on the American people as well.
[01:51:46.169 --> 01:51:50.831]  The ends up being reneged on, the Russian minister added.
[01:51:50.831 --> 01:51:55.952]  As Russian President Vladimir Putin put it, the West is now the real empire of lies, he added.
[01:51:55.952 --> 01:52:00.574]  Reckless Western politicians have forgotten about self-preservation.
[01:52:00.574 --> 01:52:01.254]  This is point two.
[01:52:02.341 --> 01:52:04.922]  Forgotten about self-preservation.
[01:52:04.922 --> 01:52:11.164]  NATO activities have reached unprecedented levels since the end of the Cold War, the top Russian diplomat believes.
[01:52:11.164 --> 01:52:17.427]  The U.S.-led bloc forces have conducted drills that involve simulated nuclear strikes against Russia.
[01:52:17.427 --> 01:52:19.368]  Even CNN's reporting that now.
[01:52:19.368 --> 01:52:22.269]  That's been building up, he reported.
[01:52:23.529 --> 01:52:35.958]  Washington is also actively seeking to protect its military might in the Asia-Pacific through establishing military-political alliances with nations like Australia, South Korea and Japan and pushing them towards closer cooperation with NATO.
[01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:38.579]  I thought NATO was just the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[01:52:38.579 --> 01:52:42.242]  Now it's global, the UN military force they talked about decades ago.
[01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.243]  And he goes on to break down what's happening.
[01:52:44.243 --> 01:52:47.325]  He goes on to say the globalists have their new world order that stands in the way of a
[01:53:10.452 --> 01:53:10.632]  I think?
[01:53:33.735 --> 01:53:43.898]  With the facts here, and I say this every day, the globalists are putting fluoride out, 5G, GMO, poison shots, that blows back on them and their families.
[01:53:43.898 --> 01:53:47.259]  They're not exempt from it, and it's destroying them as well.
[01:53:47.259 --> 01:53:50.060]  And you look at how unhappy the main dynasty families are.
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:56.502]  If you research the DuPonts, or the Rockefellers, or the Rothschilds, or any of them, highest levels of suicide in their families.
[01:53:56.502 --> 01:53:58.683]  Super high levels of transgenderism.
[01:53:58.683 --> 01:54:00.904]  They are sick, they are twisted, and they're trying to
[01:54:01.784 --> 01:54:07.556]  Project what's happened to them because of their service to evil on to us.
[01:54:07.556 --> 01:54:08.779]  And if you expand on this...
[01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:13.243]  Think about how we're told the Russians are destroying America.
[01:54:13.243 --> 01:54:14.724]  But who's cutting off our energy?
[01:54:14.724 --> 01:54:17.306]  Who's attacking our children with sexualization?
[01:54:17.306 --> 01:54:19.027]  Who is allowing fentanyl to be shipped in?
[01:54:19.027 --> 01:54:20.668]  Who's dissolved our borders?
[01:54:20.668 --> 01:54:22.870]  Who's doing a thousand other horrible things?
[01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:24.231]  It's not the Russians.
[01:54:24.231 --> 01:54:25.952]  Do the Russians control thousands of U.S.
[01:54:25.952 --> 01:54:26.912]  public schools?
[01:54:26.912 --> 01:54:28.393]  No, the Communist Chinese do.
[01:54:28.393 --> 01:54:31.335]  Do the Russians own four of the big six Hollywood production firms?
[01:54:31.335 --> 01:54:32.476]  No, the Communist Chinese do.
[01:54:32.476 --> 01:54:36.719]  And I'm not saying the Communist Chinese run it all, they're just a major command arm
[01:54:37.259 --> 01:54:37.579]  Of course.
[01:55:00.902 --> 01:55:10.171]  We'll end up biting all of us in the ass, including the globalists that have established this totalitarian transhumanist system.
[01:55:10.171 --> 01:55:15.396]  A brief history is basically the British Empire won World War I but was bankrupt after it.
[01:55:16.158 --> 01:55:20.602]  Then they basically built up Hitler, allowed him to launch the attacks he did.
[01:55:20.602 --> 01:55:33.974]  They didn't control him, but they set him up, and told the Germans they had a treaty with him, and that the King of England would become the head of the EU, and the Deputy Fuhrer had a treaty that he delivered back to the British, and so they locked him in the tower.
[01:55:33.974 --> 01:55:35.135]  Rudolf Hess.
[01:55:35.135 --> 01:55:35.955]  This is all there.
[01:55:36.676 --> 01:55:36.836]  That's
[01:56:06.596 --> 01:56:06.756]  I think?
[01:56:25.247 --> 01:56:28.790]  Because you go along with tyranny doesn't mean you're on a winning team.
[01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:29.751]  You're schmucks.
[01:56:29.751 --> 01:56:30.731]  You're fools.
[01:56:30.731 --> 01:56:33.874]  You're useful idiots that have been brought along with this system.
[01:56:33.874 --> 01:56:38.758]  The globalists claim they're launching all this war and all these sanctions and control to protect us.
[01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:48.405]  But at the same time, any place they control, they are busy shutting off the infrastructure of the general public because they cannot help the totalitarian predatory mindset.
[01:56:48.405 --> 01:56:49.846]  They are predators.
[01:56:49.846 --> 01:56:50.747]  They are pedophiles.
[01:56:51.027 --> 01:56:53.088]  They are inbred globalist degenerates.
[01:56:53.088 --> 01:56:54.849]  They are the enemy of the world.
[01:56:54.849 --> 01:56:56.749]  They are the worst elite on the planet.
[01:56:56.749 --> 01:56:58.010]  They are the plague.
[01:56:58.010 --> 01:57:02.452]  They will kill us all if we do not break with them and stop following their orders.
[01:57:02.452 --> 01:57:05.553]  Going along with the globalists is a suicide pact.
[01:57:05.553 --> 01:57:07.834]  It's a circular firing squad.
[01:57:07.834 --> 01:57:15.537]  An Infowars stands against nuclear war, stands against the destruction of national sovereignty and the family, and stands against transhumanism.
[01:57:15.677 --> 01:57:16.457]  We're going to go to break.
[01:57:16.457 --> 01:57:23.539]  We're going to end this important broadcast and hand the baton to Owen Schroer, who will host Sunday Night Live for the next two hours.
