[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.256]  I mean, Obama lives at one foot at sea level.
[00:00:02.617 --> 00:00:03.840]  He bought the house ten years ago.
[00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.181]  No, no, no.
[00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.365]  That sea is going to take his house away.
[00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:05.746]  He knows that.
[00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:09.892]  Yeah, it's like he literally has a house on the beach.
[00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:15.533]  You don't believe in climate change for a second if you're spending that kind of money on something that's going to be gone in the next 10 years.
[00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:17.053]  Well, you at least build it on like cliffs.
[00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.054]  No, it's like literally, Martha's Vineyard's like right there.
[00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:20.274]  No, I know, absolutely.
[00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:28.436]  But when the busing thing happened and we started sending, like I know DeSantis did and Abbott did, and we started sending people up to places like Chicago and New York and Washington, D.C.
[00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:32.557]  I think one of the most recent ones was actually to Kamala Harris's place and we're like, hey!
[00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:33.537]  The Naval Observatory.
[00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:37.238]  If this is not a problem, if this is not an issue for you, that's fantastic.
[00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:38.439]  We would just love to send you some.
[00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.300]  Well, look, they only shipped 500 to Chicago, and it's a total meltdown.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.600]  Crisis.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.141]  Total end of the world.
[00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:44.361]  Yeah.
[00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:48.502]  Folks, try El Paso, where there's 50,000 of them running around.
[00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:50.463]  Yeah, I love the tactic, though.
[00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.763]  It's like, oh, you think this is easy?
[00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:52.423]  Here you go.
[00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.624]  By the way, what were the estimates on building the wall?
[00:00:54.664 --> 00:00:57.005]  Something like $40 billion, if I remember correctly?
[00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:06.146]   Do you know, and we've talked about this on the show, I think it's like something around $120, $130 billion in benefits per year that are given out to illegal immigrants.
[00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.147]  Well that's the next thing.
[00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:10.147]   Nothing against these illegals are fleeing collapse from the COVID lockdowns.
[00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:11.465]  Again, I don't hate them as people.
[00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.465]  No, not at all.
[00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:14.545]  But since when do they get exempt from the COVID shot?
[00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:15.545]  Remember that?
[00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.545]  Yeah.
[00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:17.545]  They came across the border.
[00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:18.545]  Yeah.
[00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.546]  And they get given debit cards and free cell phones.
[00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.305]   And then meanwhile, there's literal veterans all over the streets homeless.
[00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:31.986]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:31.798 --> 00:01:33.798]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:52.798]  [Music]
[00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:55.027]   InfoWars Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:55.087 --> 00:02:09.926]  today.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.844]  File an immigrant petition with the government and upon approval, apply for a visa.
[00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:21.289]  You will then have to maintain a productive status for several years if you want to consider citizenship.
[00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.130]  But there is a new system now in place.
[00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:34.736]  This new system is not official, nor is it legal, and it's being done by thousands of government employees who have sworn an oath to uphold the U.S.
[00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:35.656]  Constitution.
[00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:42.239]  And yet, here they all are, submitting to the United Nations agenda and committing treason.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.920]   On the Mexico side, Mexican immigration officers lead crowds of people to crossing points at the border.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:00.420]  [Speaking Spanish]
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.920]   On the American side, government workers wait for the cover of darkness.
[00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:12.112]   And in the middle of the night, federal employees begin processing the large crowd with mobile devices.
[00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:21.112]  Middle schools are used as processing centers.
[00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:33.808]  Buses are backed in past the media as Border Patrol use government vehicles to try blocking the cameras from filming the migrants being loaded on board and brought into the country.
[00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:46.292]  The migrants are given mobile phones as a digital form of ID, bus tickets, debit cards, and court dates set four years from now.
[00:03:47.697 --> 00:03:52.841]  There are no checks or balances in this new de facto immigration system.
[00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:58.526]  And it's turning thousands of government workers into traitors to their own country.
[00:03:59.287 --> 00:04:02.247]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:19.047]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:22.402]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:22.842]  You know why?
[00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:24.082]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:27.403]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:31.304]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:35.005]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.987]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:41.267]  This is reality.
[00:04:41.408 --> 00:04:42.928]  It's just pancakes.
[00:04:43.088 --> 00:04:45.490]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.731]  A revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:50.613]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:51.753]  You're lying to the public.
[00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:52.554]  It's disgusting.
[00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:56.155]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:59.076]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:07.119]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[00:05:07.038 --> 00:05:09.338]  We're gonna get fired up about the real things!
[00:05:09.338 --> 00:05:10.838]  The things that matter!
[00:05:10.838 --> 00:05:16.338]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:37.338]   I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:45.075]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:47.297]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:53.161]  You bought a truck!
[00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.446]  You bought a truck!
[00:05:58.806 --> 00:05:59.086]  Yeah!
[00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:01.148]  Who are the presidents?
[00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:03.887]  That's the point.
[00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:04.726]  (beep)
[00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:05.548]  Muslim.
[00:06:05.548 --> 00:06:08.548]  (audience laughing)
[00:06:08.548 --> 00:06:27.266]   And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.687]  (rock music)
[00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:32.108]  (rock music)
[00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:41.288]  Well, my friends, it's Monday, May 15th, 2023.
[00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:47.007]   And I am in the incredible studios, an undisclosed location in Russia
[00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.968]  of Vladimir Putin's show.
[00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:50.147]  No, I'm sorry, Steven Crowder.
[00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:50.487]  I'm joking.
[00:06:50.507 --> 00:06:51.127]  We're in Texas.
[00:06:51.647 --> 00:06:52.268]  We love you.
[00:06:53.208 --> 00:07:02.792]  We have Gerald Morgan, the CEO of Vladimir Crowder, totally kicking ass, dominating Rumble, dominating the numbers, leading the Exodus out of Big Tech control.
[00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:08.618]   I was asking Gerald, so I just co-hosted with him while Stephen is dealing with a red tide problem.
[00:07:08.618 --> 00:07:12.859]   I just hosted with him for two hours. It was great, super fun, knocked out of the park,
[00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:16.059]   covered a lot of serious issues. I said, "What do you want to cover first?" And I was literally
[00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:19.979]   sitting there looking at my page and he said, "Well, we should probably get into Biden and the
[00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.059]   whole declaring white people are black people's biggest enemy problem, how that deals with the
[00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:28.299]   border and the stores closing everywhere and the collapse of America and what's happening there."
[00:07:28.586 --> 00:07:32.991]  So Gerald Morgan, I want to get to this clip of Biden in a moment, but this is so transparent to me.
[00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:35.254]  He even got confronted by some of the black students.
[00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:40.018]  At the university saying that, you know, Biden doesn't care about black people.
[00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:44.100]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.483]  And I'm not saying this because I'm at a black university at Howard University.
[00:07:48.643 --> 00:07:49.064]  Yes, he is.
[00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:51.105]  What would you say about this moment in time?
[00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:53.286]  I would say that he's pandering.
[00:07:53.366 --> 00:07:57.228]  He's trying to get people to vote for him, and he goes to Howard University, and this is a commencement speech.
[00:07:57.248 --> 00:07:59.149]  These people have just received their diplomas.
[00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:01.731]  They've worked really hard to make it through college and better themselves.
[00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:09.195]  And what he says is, hey, remember when I said that white supremacy is the major threat, white supremacy, that's the biggest terrorism threat to the United States?
[00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:15.098]  I don't just say it here and pander for your votes now, but I've been saying it everywhere, pandering for votes wherever I happen to go.
[00:08:15.698 --> 00:08:25.730]  I don't think that is the action that you need from a president of the United States telling black college graduates what to expect in the America that he is in charge of right now.
[00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.270]  Right?
[00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.272]  Are you saying that really that that's the biggest threat?
[00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:38.126]   We went through examples, Alex, of people That we're not white supremacists that have been doing really bad things with SUVs obviously with guns going in and shooting up different places.
[00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:42.613]  One really close to home here in Allen, Texas that happened just last week.
[00:08:43.014 --> 00:08:46.219]  We've been covering all of that and these people are apparently white supremacists.
[00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:52.185]  That are black people driving a car into Waukesha into a parade or this Hispanic guy in Allen, Texas.
[00:08:52.205 --> 00:08:53.987]  I don't think that those are white supremacists.
[00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:58.872]  And look, I don't think white supremacists are the major problem facing the United States today.
[00:08:59.252 --> 00:09:00.173]  It's an open border.
[00:09:00.213 --> 00:09:05.178]  And we just talked about an Afghan who was on the terror watch list picked up at the border.
[00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:09.521]  That's the problem that we really should be focused on when it comes to terrorism and threats.
[00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:11.102]  Just encourage people.
[00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:12.263]  They just got their degree.
[00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:14.645]  They don't want to go and hear a political speech.
[00:09:15.005 --> 00:09:21.409]  They want to know how they can go out and charge into an economy that is- They want to hear how they're part of the American dream and how they've been successful.
[00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:21.670]  Right.
[00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.590]  How they've done a good job.
[00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.652]  Not, you're victims and I'm going to protect you.
[00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:26.052]  But that's all they've got.
[00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:28.434]  If you're for globalism, you're good.
[00:09:28.454 --> 00:09:33.858]  If you're against open borders, you're against fentanyl, you're against all these wars, you're against all the woke culture, you're a white supremacist.
[00:09:33.878 --> 00:09:40.242]   Remember, Biden made that his main National security focus in June of 2021 was, quote, white supremacy.
[00:09:40.262 --> 00:09:45.226]  Then describe white supremacists as people that question elections, question lockdowns, question forced shots.
[00:09:45.607 --> 00:09:53.853]  So when you hear this term, folks, this is literally the Democratic Party, the failed state, the party of the KKK, labeling its political opposition as white supremacists.
[00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:58.817]  And then right on time, that weird white supremacist group that wears the mask just pops up.
[00:09:58.897 --> 00:09:59.578]  Right, exactly.
[00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:00.198]  Right on cue.
[00:10:00.238 --> 00:10:03.281]  And don't forget when Merrick Garland, do you remember when they were having the issues in Loudoun County?
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.780]   and all the parents started going to these school board meetings and demanding that they protect
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.540]   their children. They're like, "Oh, this is the new face of white supremacy and terrorism in
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.339]   the United States." And they got that note from the teachers union basically saying,
[00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:16.860]   "You can't allow them to come here and hold our feet to the fire. This is something that we can't
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.060]   deal with. These are terrorists." And Merrick Garland basically acquiesced. And it will turn
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.540]   out Merrick Garland actually sent them a memo getting him to do that. Yeah. It's incredible
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.860]   to me that you would think that you could paint white supremacists as the bad guy.
[00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:30.533]  Are there white supremacists in this country?
[00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:32.034]  Yes, there are few and far between.
[00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:34.975]  But statistically, it's like seeing a unicorn.
[00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:35.455]  Exactly!
[00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:35.995]  It really is.
[00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:37.756]  If you see a white supremacist, you're like, well, wow!
[00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:38.857]  They do exist!
[00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:40.396]  You don't really see it at all.
[00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:43.476]   Let me ask you this, because you don't want to talk about the great show you're doing,
[00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.636]  but it's true.
[00:10:44.636 --> 00:10:49.396]   The exodus out of the system, building our own system, you know, is Elon Musk for real?
[00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:53.796]   He's freed up Twitter to a great extent, now he's put in the WEF global coordinator.
[00:10:53.796 --> 00:10:56.836]  It really concerns people, but what we know you're for real.
[00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.711]  We know I'm for real.
[00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:03.637]  Talk about, just for the viewers, this is important, the revolution you guys are involved in because you led the Exodus out of YouTube.
[00:11:04.157 --> 00:11:08.161]  You have absolutely been able to convert the numbers and dominate and do what nobody else has done.
[00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.803]  Tucker Carlson's trying to leave and do his own thing.
[00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:14.687]  I'm sure it'll be successful, but this is revolutionary what you guys are doing with Mug Club.
[00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:15.748]  Tell my viewers about that.
[00:11:15.888 --> 00:11:18.549]  Yeah, so a couple of years ago, we actually started streaming.
[00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:22.790]  Kind of the secondary stream was to Rumble because we kept getting strikes for no apparent reason, right?
[00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.732]  They kept coming up with rules to make sure that we couldn't broadcast on YouTube.
[00:11:25.772 --> 00:11:29.953]  And so to try to make sure that we at least had a place to go, Alex, you're very familiar with this.
[00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:32.174]  Like they're striking websites essentially for you.
[00:11:32.294 --> 00:11:33.494]  Like, ah, you can't host that server.
[00:11:33.514 --> 00:11:34.635]  You can't promote that website.
[00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:36.995]  You can't promote that URL on social media.
[00:11:37.355 --> 00:11:41.155]   So to make sure that we had a place to go, we said, "Look, we need to start streaming somewhere else.
[00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:43.316]  "Can't be Facebook, can't be anywhere else.
[00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:45.235]  "What's out there that's free speech?"
[00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:46.436]  And we went to Rumble.
[00:11:46.436 --> 00:11:49.715]   And then as time progressed, we started to see that audience grow just a little bit.
[00:11:49.715 --> 00:11:53.115]   We started talking with the guys over at Rumble and saying, "Hey, who are you?
[00:11:53.115 --> 00:11:54.275]  "What are you really about?"
[00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:57.596]   I got to know the head of Locals, which is their subscription service part,
[00:11:57.596 --> 00:11:59.995]  and then the head of Rumble very, very well.
[00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:04.316]   We got to talk for months just going back and forth on who they were, what they believed in,
[00:12:04.316 --> 00:12:06.755]  what kind of contract this thing would look like.
[00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:09.754]   And then we said, we had a meeting and we said, "Look, we can go out on our own,
[00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:10.676]  "kind of like you are, right?
[00:12:10.676 --> 00:12:13.515]  "We can go on our own and we can make the same money.
[00:12:13.515 --> 00:12:15.155]  "We can make the same amount of money going on our own.
[00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:18.275]   "It's a little bit harder, "but what we really want to do
[00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:21.475]  "is help something that's bigger than ourselves."
[00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:22.764]  I want to go out and make a great show.
[00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:23.084]  Exactly.
[00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:26.786]  You guys have already energized Rumble, which is the system's scared of.
[00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:27.967]  It's running Super Bowl ads.
[00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:29.588]  It's getting hundreds of millions of views.
[00:12:29.608 --> 00:12:30.989]  I mean, it's scaring the system.
[00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:33.631]  Well, and we did something that people didn't think we could do.
[00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:37.494]  We went on Rumble and our numbers went to much, much, much higher levels than YouTube.
[00:12:37.514 --> 00:12:40.356]  By the way, on YouTube, I think we have roughly six million subscribers right now.
[00:12:40.716 --> 00:12:44.118]  That number would be double that if we weren't being throttled by YouTube.
[00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:45.179]  We have no idea, right?
[00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:47.781]  So our live shows, the number skyrocketed.
[00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:52.744]  When we went over to Rumble, it was like, oh, this is what it feels like not to be throttled by the big tech overlords.
[00:12:52.784 --> 00:12:53.605]  This is fantastic.
[00:12:53.885 --> 00:12:55.786]  To the point of Rumble couldn't even handle the ban one.
[00:12:55.826 --> 00:12:56.367]  No, they couldn't.
[00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:56.847]  Absolutely.
[00:12:56.867 --> 00:12:58.528]  And they're working their butts off to try to handle it.
[00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:03.111]  But these guys are in a position to grow and change how information is shared in this country.
[00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:03.751]  Well, that's another thing.
[00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:05.593]  When you're super banned, that's the thing.
[00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.434]  You should have never been banned.
[00:13:07.894 --> 00:13:13.480]  You'd never, ever, ever should have been gone, and everybody should have been able to go and follow you on Rumble, a free speech platform.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.024]  Never should have happened in the first place, but since it did, we need the alternative.
[00:13:17.044 --> 00:13:21.029]  That's why this is so revolutionary, and that's why listeners say, well, just build your own thing.
[00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:23.691]  Well, you guys and Rumble have finally done it.
[00:13:24.312 --> 00:13:27.155]  I know what it costs to have millions of viewers a day and pay for the bandwidth.
[00:13:27.716 --> 00:13:28.717]  It's a big nut to crack.
[00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:35.324]  So the fact that you guys have basically been successful doing what nobody else did, working with Rumble, is a big breakthrough for all of us.
[00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:36.745]  And you guys are pulling that out.
[00:13:37.226 --> 00:13:40.349]  So you guys are kind of hitting the barbed wire, the icebreaker, leading the way.
[00:13:40.489 --> 00:13:43.532]  Well, and it's not just the live show numbers for us that have been fantastic.
[00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:47.316]  The actual just, you know, show numbers that we're doing right now are great.
[00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:48.798]  Just really, just looking at Rumble.
[00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:50.580]  We really don't even care much about YouTube anymore.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.781]  The numbers, there are numbers there.
[00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:52.882]  There's some people that watch there.
[00:13:53.263 --> 00:13:57.646]   But if you're a creator right now out there, if you have a favorite creator, Don't watch them on YouTube.
[00:13:57.687 --> 00:13:59.627]  Don't watch them on any mainstream platform.
[00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:06.409]  Go to Rumble and support Rumble because I guarantee you, once people start seeing that the numbers are possible there, that means the ad dollars will follow.
[00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:13.392]  Even if you don't want the ad dollars, if you don't want to focus on sponsors because you don't want to be beholden to people, or if you want to pick, I know you've got some great sponsors, so do we.
[00:14:13.732 --> 00:14:16.093]  We pick people we can partner with that share our values.
[00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:17.173]  We don't have to worry about anything.
[00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.174]  Exactly, and again, that's a microcosm.
[00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:25.698]  It's a big microcosm, but what Latimer Crowder Mug Club's doing on Rumble is the example of everybody else, and everybody follows suit.
[00:14:25.838 --> 00:14:31.261]  Then we build the new world, we build the new system, and make the enemy obsolete, which they thought we couldn't do.
[00:14:31.281 --> 00:14:32.101]  So that's why I'm so excited.
[00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:32.682]  They're scared, yeah.
[00:14:33.142 --> 00:14:45.809]  So since we talked about it, here's that Biden clip at the university literally invoking, forget your degree, forget your hard work, your number one enemy is white people, but don't worry, this old white guy that made all these racist statements, he's going to protect you.
[00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:52.265]   Stand up against the poison of white supremacy as I did my inaugural address through a single
[00:14:52.265 --> 00:15:06.065]   out as the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:10.666]  I'm not saying this because I'm a black HBCU.
[00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:12.106]  I say it wherever I go.
[00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:17.605]  I mean, that is just outrageously transparent.
[00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:18.566]  That's unbelievable.
[00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:19.647]  I just don't say this here.
[00:15:19.907 --> 00:15:21.929]  Do you notice that Pat, the people, didn't really clap?
[00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:23.991]  They're like, oh, I just got my degree.
[00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:26.814]  Can we talk about how I'm going to go and make a living in the economy that you've destroyed?
[00:15:26.854 --> 00:15:27.774]  I'd like to see it come back.
[00:15:27.814 --> 00:15:30.417]  Maybe if you'd get your foot off the fricking neck of it, maybe it would.
[00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:40.449]  It's truly disgusting, but remember, that's their entire Homeland Security direction, so that's why I'm really concerned about the Patriot Front and groups that I believe are synthetic stage groups.
[00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:46.413]  I'm really worried about them provocateuring something, because they set the table that the number one issue is white supremacy.
[00:15:46.453 --> 00:15:50.156]  Well, then what are they expecting to come through that's going to legitimize that?
[00:15:50.196 --> 00:15:55.379]  Like the guy that attacked folks in North Dallas and Allen a few weeks ago, the Hispanic guy they're saying is a white supremacist.
[00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:56.939]  I'd never seen that before.
[00:15:56.959 --> 00:16:05.402]  I didn't realize that that was even a thing, that you could be Hispanic and be a white supremacist and go into an area that's mostly filled with Indians and Asians and white people and shoot that up.
[00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:06.183]  I didn't think that was a thing.
[00:16:07.263 --> 00:16:10.544]  Meanwhile, you saw his manifesto came out where he was anti-white.
[00:16:11.084 --> 00:16:12.245]  Yeah.
[00:16:12.425 --> 00:16:14.666]  So an anti-white guy is a white supremacist.
[00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:20.988]  So let's segue this then, Gerald Morgan, here at the great Steven Crowder Studios in an undisclosed location.
[00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:36.706]  When you look at the collapsing borders, the failed blue states, the fentanyl, the stores, the Walmarts, the Targets, the CVSs, the Walgreens, and not just San Francisco or Chicago or Philadelphia or Baltimore, they're closing down all over the place.
[00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:40.067]  What is the end game of the left doing this?
[00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:44.989]  And I want to play a clip from one of our security guys with our crew just on Friday.
[00:16:45.689 --> 00:17:03.802]  At the border that's gone viral, and he's a former Texas National Guardsman, he was regular army before that, confronting them, because the governor did put out an order, Abbott did put an order out saying, interdict and stop illegals and push them across the border, but then the Texas National Guard shows up, they're under command of the Border Patrol, and then green-haired, purple-haired NGOs are in charge.
[00:17:04.182 --> 00:17:05.563]  So is Abbott that dumb?
[00:17:05.603 --> 00:17:06.724]  He doesn't know that's the case?
[00:17:07.104 --> 00:17:08.485]  Or are they just not following his orders?
[00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:14.290]  I don't know, I mean, I think in that case, you've got guys in uniform that are, I think, in a tough spot, right?
[00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:23.293]  Now, I'm not giving them a pass, because they're supposed to do their job, and they're supposed to make sure that they follow orders from their commander, and their commander, if you're in the Texas National Guard, is Greg Abbott.
[00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:25.254]  He's the governor, he's the chief of this state, right?
[00:17:25.634 --> 00:17:30.556]  So you're supposed to follow those orders, and you're supposed to make sure that this happens, but look around, Alex, down there at the border.
[00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:32.876]  When you were down there, they'd be the only ones doing their job.
[00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:33.817]  No, no, the feds are in control!
[00:17:34.757 --> 00:17:35.277]  Exactly, yeah.
[00:17:35.398 --> 00:17:39.420]  They'd be the only one of those guys doing it, and so I think the problem is bigger than just a couple of guys.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.163]  And by the way, I saw that video earlier, and your guy was incredibly respectful, and the guy was like, oh, so what, we're a bunch of a-holes?
[00:17:44.183 --> 00:17:44.943]  And he's like, no, I'm not.
[00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:45.824]  That's not what I'm saying.
[00:17:45.844 --> 00:17:47.405]  I'm saying you're supposed to be following orders.
[00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:50.767]  But the broader point is chaos, right?
[00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:53.629]  The broader point is AOC and all the liberals on the left.
[00:17:53.649 --> 00:17:57.211]  Well, that was my question, and I'm willing to answer it, because I said it exactly.
[00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:59.232]  What is the point of collapsing civilization?
[00:17:59.332 --> 00:18:03.635]  Yeah, it's chaos, and look, if you are part of the elites, does this hit you?
[00:18:03.936 --> 00:18:04.736]  No, of course not.
[00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:15.525]  You can create chaos in these major cities, and you can keep your armed security guards, and you can keep your gated community, and you can keep your house that's secure and well-armed with people that are there with guns, but nobody else can have guns in your community.
[00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:17.207]  So you don't care nearly as much.
[00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:19.770]  What you care about the most is power.
[00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:22.474]  Look at all of these other countries that have dictatorial regimes.
[00:18:22.514 --> 00:18:24.116]  And the bigger the crisis, the more power you get.
[00:18:24.216 --> 00:18:24.657]  Exactly.
[00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.838]  They care about power.
[00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:30.505]  The dictatorial regimes in history have been terrible places to live, right?
[00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:31.165]  Absolutely.
[00:18:31.185 --> 00:18:32.627]  They're willing to wreck everything.
[00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:33.648]  For the power.
[00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:34.489]  Absolutely.
[00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:42.116]  Everything gets sacrificed because they don't look at it as one of the videos we just saw a minute ago was a bunch of people running into a store and grabbing all the clothes and running out.
[00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.638]  If that was happening in their neighborhood, they'd gripe about it.
[00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:45.379]  And you know how I know that?
[00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:49.582]  Because every time it does happen in their neighborhood, you hear them going, I can't believe this!
[00:18:49.662 --> 00:18:50.703]  I was worried for my life!
[00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:57.129]  AOC was seven buildings away from the protests that were going on on January 6th and she said, I thought I was going to die!
[00:18:57.629 --> 00:19:15.855]  Look, it finally came, I don't, look, I understand you may not like what happened on January 6th and people got out of control, but the summer of love that you guys pushed, where people were killed, hundreds of officer casualties, billions of dollars in damage, we had buildings being burned, cars being burned, people's lives being terrorized, you didn't care then because it wasn't on your doorstep.
[00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:17.816]  And Gerald, I've got another great example for you.
[00:19:17.836 --> 00:19:21.299]  Gerald Morgan here, Rodney Shockley, CEO of the Stephen Crowder Empire.
[00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:26.543]  We're sitting here, remember Martha's Vineyard, they shipped like 42, 44, I forget the exact number.
[00:19:27.203 --> 00:19:28.584]  They couldn't get them out of there fast enough.
[00:19:28.704 --> 00:19:30.886]  I mean, and then they clapped and gave themselves awards.
[00:19:30.906 --> 00:19:37.931]  They were gone 24 hours later, they didn't say stay here, they got buses and shipped them to a military base, and then shipped them to some little town.
[00:19:38.372 --> 00:19:40.413]  They can't take, you've got billionaires.
[00:19:40.473 --> 00:19:45.697]   I mean, Martha's Vineyard, The median income is like $10 million a year.
[00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:46.317]  I was looking it up.
[00:19:46.617 --> 00:19:48.618]  The average person that lives there is worth like $500 million.
[00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:51.760]  They've got a hundred billionaires living in the area.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.382]  So, they're in billionaires' houses.
[00:19:54.662 --> 00:19:55.722]  They're literally showing up.
[00:19:55.743 --> 00:19:59.265]  They want us to kick veterans out of hotels who are homos to put them in.
[00:19:59.705 --> 00:20:00.025]  Great!
[00:20:00.285 --> 00:20:02.346]  But then they are literally Martha's Vineyard.
[00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:03.587]  Remember when the buses left?
[00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:04.388]  They clapped.
[00:20:04.408 --> 00:20:04.768]  They did!
[00:20:04.808 --> 00:20:05.948]  Like, we did a great job!
[00:20:06.008 --> 00:20:06.749]  Bye-bye!
[00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:08.310]  We hosted you for a day and a half.
[00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.591]  We feel like we've done our duty.
[00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:12.093]  You know what average number of empty bedrooms in Martha's Vineyard?
[00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:12.993]  Seven per house.
[00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:15.155]  They had plenty of room to be able to go in there.
[00:20:15.195 --> 00:20:15.695]  I'm just kidding.
[00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.716]  That's probably not a real stat.
[00:20:16.776 --> 00:20:18.457]  But you know these are massive homes.
[00:20:18.657 --> 00:20:19.638]  I think that's conservative.
[00:20:19.698 --> 00:20:20.098]  Probably.
[00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:25.642]  I look the numbers up and there's different variants, but they say something like a hundred millionaires live in the area.
[00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:26.382]  Okay.
[00:20:26.743 --> 00:20:27.023]  Wow.
[00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:27.403]  A hundred.
[00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:28.324]  I mean, you go there.
[00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:30.645]  I mean, Obama lives at one foot at sea level.
[00:20:30.986 --> 00:20:32.246]  He bought the house ten years ago.
[00:20:32.287 --> 00:20:32.567]  No, no, no.
[00:20:32.587 --> 00:20:33.748]  That sea is going to take his house away.
[00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:34.148]  He knows that.
[00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.273]  Yeah, it's like he literally has a house on the beach.
[00:20:38.973 --> 00:20:43.917]  You don't believe in climate change for a second if you're spending that kind of money on something that's going to be gone in the next 10 years.
[00:20:43.937 --> 00:20:45.439]  Well, you at least build it on like cliffs.
[00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:47.440]  No, it's like literally, Bob's Vineyard's like right there.
[00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.661]  No, I know, absolutely.
[00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:56.828]  But when the busing thing happened and we started sending, like I know DeSantis did and Abbott did, and we started sending people up to places like Chicago and New York and Washington, D.C.
[00:20:56.849 --> 00:21:00.952]  I think one of the most recent ones was actually to Kamala Harris's place and we're like, hey!
[00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:01.933]  The Naval Observatory.
[00:21:02.093 --> 00:21:05.617]  If this is not a problem, if this is not an issue for you, that's fantastic.
[00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:06.818]  We would just love to send you some.
[00:21:06.838 --> 00:21:10.683]  Well look, they only shipped 500 to Chicago and it's a total meltdown.
[00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:11.003]  Crisis.
[00:21:11.323 --> 00:21:12.525]  Total end of the world.
[00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:16.509]  Folks, try El Paso where there's 50,000 of them running around.
[00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.830]  Yeah, I love the tactic, though.
[00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.151]  It's like, oh, you think this is easy?
[00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:20.791]  Here you go.
[00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:22.992]  By the way, what were the estimates on building the wall?
[00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.372]  Something like $40 billion, if I remember correctly?
[00:21:25.732 --> 00:21:34.455]  Do you know, and we've talked about this on the show, I think it's like something around $120, $130 billion in benefits per year that are given out to illegal immigrants.
[00:21:34.475 --> 00:21:35.175]  Well, that's the next thing.
[00:21:36.335 --> 00:21:38.576]  These illegals are fleeing collapse from the COVID lockdowns.
[00:21:38.616 --> 00:21:38.896]  I get it.
[00:21:38.916 --> 00:21:39.736]  I don't hate them as people.
[00:21:39.776 --> 00:21:40.356]  No, not at all.
[00:21:40.696 --> 00:21:42.917]  But since when do they get exempt from the COVID shot?
[00:21:42.937 --> 00:21:43.337]  Remember that?
[00:21:43.577 --> 00:21:43.837]  Yeah.
[00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.798]  And they get given debit cards and free cell phones.
[00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:50.599]  And then meanwhile, there's literal veterans all over the streets, homeless.
[00:21:50.759 --> 00:21:50.959]  Yeah.
[00:21:51.479 --> 00:21:56.260]  And so when you were talking about them coming in from getting, you know, they don't have to have the COVID shot.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:56.781]  Guess who does?
[00:21:57.521 --> 00:21:59.461]  People who try to come here legally right now.
[00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:02.242]  They're still forced to make sure that they have the vaccine.
[00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:03.595]  Can you believe that?
[00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:09.756]  People that they're letting run the streets, basically, just ship them somewhere, let them run around, they don't have to have the COVID yet.
[00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:21.439]  Nobody should have to have it, by the way, but if you're really going to make somebody have it, maybe the illegal immigrants, not the people who are coming in legally, not the people who are volunteering and checking the box and signing the guest book and saying, hey, I'd like to come here and do something good for this country.
[00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:23.819]  Those guys should be exempt if anybody is.
[00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:24.199]  I'm sorry.
[00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:25.359]  They're just really... No, you're right.
[00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.440]  Not Gabe Gerald is making some good points.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.360]  Oh, come on!
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.001]  No, not gay Alex.
[00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:31.263]  That guy was going off on me right now.
[00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:31.623]  It's a joke.
[00:22:31.663 --> 00:22:32.885]  Not gay Alex has asked the question.
[00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:35.248]  If you're not a regular crowd over here, you don't get the joke.
[00:22:35.268 --> 00:22:36.049]  So it's nothing to do with Gerald.
[00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:36.489]  It's a joke.
[00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.211]  Everybody knows it's me that's gay.
[00:22:38.712 --> 00:22:40.454]  Robert Barnes is coming up next segment.
[00:22:40.474 --> 00:22:42.917]  Constitutional lawyer to cover the waterfront on everything that's happening.
[00:22:43.257 --> 00:22:46.441]  Owen Schroeder is just the border for a week with incredible viral footage.
[00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:52.262]  And then Peter Brimlow, who's one of the key immigration experts in the country, and then Gerald Salente.
[00:22:52.282 --> 00:22:54.402]  We've got a lot of big guests, a lot of big news.
[00:22:54.482 --> 00:22:58.483]  I tend to also take calls today, but we've got six minutes left with Gerald Morgan.
[00:22:58.963 --> 00:23:02.244]  Gerald, I can ask a lot of questions, but in the time we've got... No, I'm not gay.
[00:23:03.784 --> 00:23:04.724]  Well, you said you could ask a lot.
[00:23:04.744 --> 00:23:06.184]  I just wanted to take a lot off the table.
[00:23:06.464 --> 00:23:07.165]  It's an old joke.
[00:23:08.685 --> 00:23:10.125]  It's an old joke that's been made new.
[00:23:10.685 --> 00:23:11.205]  Absolutely.
[00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:15.126]  But, well, it's me saying it, so it's obviously me that's insecure about it.
[00:23:16.092 --> 00:23:17.633]  And I'm gay for Joe Biden's diaper.
[00:23:17.673 --> 00:23:18.553]  No, I'm going to stop.
[00:23:18.593 --> 00:23:19.894]  I'm going to stop.
[00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:21.074]  It's a comedy show.
[00:23:21.175 --> 00:23:22.095]  Messy diaper, my friend.
[00:23:22.295 --> 00:23:22.875]  I should not.
[00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:23.856]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:23:24.356 --> 00:23:29.138]  But getting serious here, of all the other issues, are you optimistic?
[00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:30.859]  Because I overall am optimistic.
[00:23:30.919 --> 00:23:31.920]  I'm seeing a huge awakening.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.062]  I'm not trying to put put perfume on a pig here, but I really see big change.
[00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:38.123]  But then I think the establishment's going to double down.
[00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:40.424]  What do you think is coming up in the next year and a half?
[00:23:40.504 --> 00:23:42.485]  I mean, this is get your popcorn out.
[00:23:42.785 --> 00:23:44.466]  I'm very optimistic and mostly for companies like Rumble.
[00:23:44.326 --> 00:23:46.206]  is a boring time, it's crazy.
[00:23:46.206 --> 00:23:47.204]  This is going to be nuts.
[00:23:47.204 --> 00:23:49.964]   I mean, if the left's gone this crazy, what's going to happen next?
[00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:54.605]   I'm very optimistic and mostly for companies like Rumble, if Elon changes his direction,
[00:23:54.605 --> 00:23:59.924]   because right now we had a good conversation about that, whether he's for good or for
[00:23:59.924 --> 00:24:03.726]   evil, we're not really sure right now because of some of the decisions that he's making,
[00:24:03.726 --> 00:24:04.925]  so that's frustrating for us.
[00:24:05.323 --> 00:24:15.352]  But the more people can get access to accurate information, even if it's just to see what they believe and what they don't believe, everybody should have a right to go, you know what, I don't know if Alex is telling the truth, let me do my own research and make sure.
[00:24:15.632 --> 00:24:17.514]  That's exactly what you would tell them to do, by the way.
[00:24:17.774 --> 00:24:20.557]  Don't ever follow what anybody says, lock, stock and barrel.
[00:24:20.577 --> 00:24:22.459]  That's Trump included or Biden, anybody else.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.422]  Go and see if it's true.
[00:24:24.442 --> 00:24:25.883]  It's Act 1711 in the Bible.
[00:24:25.903 --> 00:24:27.846]  They went and said, is this stuff true?
[00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:30.469]  They were ready to receive in their hearts, but they went and did the research on it.
[00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:31.450]  You should always do that.
[00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.010]  But I am.
[00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:37.015]  I'm encouraged by what we're seeing from some of the younger generation and from people finally waking up.
[00:24:37.315 --> 00:24:40.118]  I'm also encouraged because they're seeing the results, right?
[00:24:40.138 --> 00:24:42.420]  We had eight years of Obama and Stephen likes to say this a lot.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:49.127]  We had basically two and a half years or three years under Donald Trump where the economy was doing fantastic and then the world shut down, right?
[00:24:49.547 --> 00:24:54.632]  Now we've got four years of Joe Biden to look at going into this next election, really about three, three and a half.
[00:24:55.152 --> 00:24:56.552]  He's doing a terrible job.
[00:24:56.572 --> 00:25:00.993]  He has an approval rating that rivals Congress, which I didn't think was possible, at like 36%.
[00:25:01.413 --> 00:25:06.874]  He's going to have to do something to get people back on his side, and here's where the fear came in that you were talking about.
[00:25:07.554 --> 00:25:20.816]  Is he going to do something that's going to be like, okay, we need some white supremacists to go out and do something, some quote-unquote white supremacists to go out and do something so that the economy is not the focus anymore, so that people aren't worried about the border anymore, that they're not worried about these cities that are crashing?
[00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:24.197]  No, I totally agree, because they keep saying, the white supremacists are about to kill everybody!
[00:25:24.717 --> 00:25:32.061]  It's eminent, it's eminent, you've got obvious provocateur groups, you know, shake and bake, rent-a-mobs, astro-turf, exactly.
[00:25:32.181 --> 00:25:34.402]  I really think, I think they're going to stage something.
[00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:35.602]  I do too, because you're right.
[00:25:35.823 --> 00:25:40.205]  You and I are looking around going, white supremacists are the biggest terrorist threat in this country?
[00:25:40.245 --> 00:25:41.345]  Are you setting something up?
[00:25:41.826 --> 00:25:43.466]  Because this doesn't make any sense otherwise.
[00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:50.930]  If you said, hey, it's really possible right now that Islamic Jihad could come through the southern border and maybe set off a dirty bomb or something like that.
[00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:55.500]   Probably gonna happen. We would say you know what that's probably something that I could see happening. It sucks. It's
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.278]   very scary Let's do what we can to prevent that but if I said hey Alex.
[00:25:58.278 --> 00:26:01.059]   You know the white supremacist man Those terrorist groups out there. They're really gonna get
[00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:06.009]   after us you'd be like Exactly more of you said Biden just refunded the Wuhan lab
[00:26:06.009 --> 00:26:11.538]   yeah and Peter Daszak and the coronavirus research So I can see another virus getting out like you'd be like
[00:26:11.538 --> 00:26:13.809]   well I hope that happened, but he's not I'm worried about
[00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:16.769]   That's all you have to say is a health care and financial collapse
[00:26:16.769 --> 00:26:20.440]   I don't know if you guys are gonna talk about this Oh, you you brought it up our gentleman just told me for
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.900]   him went live to Martin June pull it up They just raised their interest rate to 97% to curb
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.395]   inflation Do you think there's not a problem going on?
[00:26:28.415 --> 00:26:30.796]  Let me tell my career right now, guys, because they're in Austin.
[00:26:31.196 --> 00:26:33.117]  Type in Argentina raises interest rates to 97%.
[00:26:34.098 --> 00:26:37.280]  For folks who don't know, that is like putting 50 bullets in somebody's heart.
[00:26:38.726 --> 00:26:42.867]  I mean, if a few rate points brought our economy down, Gerald, what does that signify?
[00:26:42.927 --> 00:26:43.687]  Why would they do that?
[00:26:43.807 --> 00:26:44.027]  Right.
[00:26:44.067 --> 00:26:49.789]  When we go up by, you know, a quarter of a percent, that means that all hell's about to break loose in Argentina if it hasn't already.
[00:26:49.989 --> 00:26:51.209]  Ninety-seven percent.
[00:26:51.249 --> 00:26:59.411]  Think about what you would have to do to be able to borrow to do anything, to buy a car, to buy a house, to be able to afford to pay for anything in your economy.
[00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:04.932]  If you want to put your economy into total freefall after years of lockdowns, you would raise your interest rates ten points.
[00:27:05.453 --> 00:27:09.314]   Ninety-seven percent is like It's like dropping somebody into a pool of lava.
[00:27:09.474 --> 00:27:10.515]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:14.517]  The Zimbabwe trillion dollar bill is probably the closest thing right here, right?
[00:27:14.537 --> 00:27:17.279]  So the Argentine inflation smashes past every forecast to hit 109%.
[00:27:17.899 --> 00:27:19.520]  That's the inflation, not the interest rate.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.582]  The interest rate itself just got raised to combat that inflation.
[00:27:22.602 --> 00:27:24.623]  Yeah, you would combat that with a 6% or 7%.
[00:27:24.683 --> 00:27:24.923]  Yeah.
[00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:26.104]  You wouldn't do it with a 97%.
[00:27:26.284 --> 00:27:26.725]  That is like...
[00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:32.367]  That's like we're trying to kill an ant dropping a nuclear bomb on it.
[00:27:32.547 --> 00:27:33.288]  I don't understand.
[00:27:33.308 --> 00:27:35.368]  Hold on, I got a better one for you.
[00:27:35.588 --> 00:27:39.390]  That's like being Joe Biden and cutting off the Keystone Pipeline the first day in office.
[00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:40.830]  It is that insane.
[00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:44.632]  You could just make the United States not energy independent anymore by cutting off all the leases.
[00:27:44.652 --> 00:27:47.353]  Well, that's the biggest way to hurt people, but I know you pulled it up on your phone.
[00:27:47.373 --> 00:27:48.393]  Tell my crew and they'll find it.
[00:27:48.854 --> 00:27:50.614]  General, I want to see this, I believe you.
[00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:51.915]  97% Argentina increase in industry.
[00:27:55.396 --> 00:27:57.317]  Yeah, if they're on Twitter, you can search it there.
[00:27:57.357 --> 00:27:58.117]  You can search it.
[00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:01.358]  There was dozens of news organizations that had it about an hour ago.
[00:28:01.398 --> 00:28:03.899]  I follow Disclosed.tv on Twitter.
[00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:06.159]  They have a pretty good record of kind of breaking things.
[00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:06.819]  Well, we'll find it.
[00:28:06.859 --> 00:28:07.360]  Here it is.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.480]  Argentine inflation.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.240]  No, it's the same article, guys.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.061]  We don't want inflation to 109.
[00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:13.701]  I love the crew.
[00:28:14.862 --> 00:28:16.462]  Inflation is the inflation number.
[00:28:18.723 --> 00:28:20.584]  Bank interest rates are a whole other deal.
[00:28:21.164 --> 00:28:21.784]  We're going to find it.
[00:28:22.557 --> 00:28:23.197]  We're gonna come back.
[00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:26.420]  Hold on, I want you to, uh... This is the stuff that takes years off my life right now.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.904]  Every one of these things, like, I'm searching it right now in every one of the posts that I just saw.
[00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:33.564]  Here we go.
[00:28:33.985 --> 00:28:37.727]  Just in Argentina, so this is from Bloomberg Business here, just so you know that I'm not lying.
[00:28:38.127 --> 00:28:38.588]  I believe you.
[00:28:38.608 --> 00:28:40.189]  Twitter right there, Bloomberg Business.
[00:28:40.209 --> 00:28:40.849]  They're amazing.
[00:28:41.329 --> 00:28:42.971]  They said in... We don't want to see 109% inflation, folks.
[00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.810]  We don't want to see 109% inflation folks.
[00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.810]  Read him the Bloomberg.
[00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:48.810]  Boom.
[00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:49.810]  Bloomberg.
[00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.810]  Bloomberg.
[00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:51.810]  She hit my office.
[00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:52.810]  There it is.
[00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.810]  Argentina to hike rates and bid to stem inflation.
[00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.810]  97%.
[00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.810]  That is hard to believe.
[00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.810]  My goodness gracious, do you have any crickets?
[00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.810]  Well, Gerald Morgan, you're incredible.
[00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.810]  How do people find Steven Crowder?
[00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:05.810]  They find Steven Crowder at @scrowder.
[00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.810]  We're on Rumble and you can find me @gmorganjr on Twitter.
[00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.810]  Thank you.
[00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.810]  [Explosion]
[00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:16.720]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:16.900]  I think.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.601]  Just let me think.
[00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:23.443]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:29:23.463 --> 00:29:24.884]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:29:24.944 --> 00:29:25.484]  Damn it!
[00:29:25.544 --> 00:29:25.864]  Why?
[00:29:26.585 --> 00:29:32.587]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:43.709]   Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:44.929]  You designed it, sir.
[00:29:44.989 --> 00:29:45.910]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.290]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:51.092]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:29:51.492 --> 00:30:01.397]  And where once you had the freedom to object, think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:30:01.417 --> 00:30:01.997]  We need cameras.
[00:30:02.338 --> 00:30:03.718]  How did this happen?
[00:30:03.778 --> 00:30:04.539]  Who's to blame?
[00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:08.221]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:10.162]  They will be held accountable.
[00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:15.985]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:30:17.176 --> 00:30:18.697]  I know why you did it.
[00:30:18.777 --> 00:30:20.258]  I know you were afraid.
[00:30:20.658 --> 00:30:21.398]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:30:21.898 --> 00:30:22.399]  War?
[00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:23.059]  Terror?
[00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:23.959]  Disease?
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.983]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:30:31.043 --> 00:30:36.786]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:44.225]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:30:44.225 --> 00:30:51.225]  There is a war in the world.
[00:30:51.994 --> 00:30:53.015]  It's happening now.
[00:30:53.856 --> 00:30:55.678]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:30:56.219 --> 00:30:58.041]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:30:58.842 --> 00:31:00.304]  We are the resistance.
[00:31:00.523 --> 00:31:02.523]  We are the InfoWar.
[00:31:02.523 --> 00:31:08.523]  [Music]
[00:31:08.523 --> 00:31:12.023]  Alright, we've got a lot of big guests lined up today.
[00:31:12.081 --> 00:31:19.585]  The first is Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, historian with the smartest people I know, Owen Schroyer, back from an incredible, successful mission.
[00:31:20.085 --> 00:31:23.948]  They reached 30, 40 million people, huge national story, picked up by Fox News, you name it.
[00:31:24.248 --> 00:31:29.231]  What's happening at the border, and the border expert, Peter Brimlow, joining us as well, as well as Gerald Cilente.
[00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.892]  I want to go right to Robert Barnes right now.
[00:31:31.912 --> 00:31:33.513]  I haven't talked to him before, we went live to him.
[00:31:33.953 --> 00:31:36.615]  I just, I just really wanted to get him on.
[00:31:37.796 --> 00:31:52.360]   Last night to break down all the things that are unfolding and as soon as we get him on the line We're gonna be going to him, but but but please just remember ladies and gentlemen dead We can't do this without you.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:59.884]  And it is only your word of mouth, it is only your support of the broadcast that allows this to happen.
[00:32:00.144 --> 00:32:05.047]  And the enemy is pushing around the clock to shut us down, to silence us, because they want to silence you.
[00:32:05.828 --> 00:32:09.750]  And so, if we didn't have any power, they would not be trying to shut us down.
[00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.953]  They would not be fighting like the devil to silence us.
[00:32:14.773 --> 00:32:18.554]  So again, I just want to thank all of you for your support, your word of mouth.
[00:32:19.154 --> 00:32:27.197]  And I want to thank Stephen Crowder because out of all the people in the independent media that's become the new media, most of them ran away scared to support us when we got censored.
[00:32:27.217 --> 00:32:28.137]  Stephen Crowder didn't do that.
[00:32:28.517 --> 00:32:30.377]  And Stephen's having huge success.
[00:32:30.397 --> 00:32:31.358]  He's always had great success.
[00:32:31.378 --> 00:32:32.938]  He's having the biggest successes ever.
[00:32:33.258 --> 00:32:37.096]   But what he's doing, leading people in an exodus out of big tech into rumble in other
[00:32:37.096 --> 00:32:42.498]   areas, it's a very exciting moment to be alive and to be doing this.
[00:32:42.498 --> 00:32:47.538]   So please go to mfolwarestore.com and get X3, the triiodine, the missing link.
[00:32:47.538 --> 00:32:49.177]  Most people are deficient in it.
[00:32:49.177 --> 00:32:53.418]  Most iodine is bound to other compounds, other elements.
[00:32:53.418 --> 00:32:54.418]  You don't absorb it.
[00:32:54.418 --> 00:32:55.538]  We have the best.
[00:32:55.538 --> 00:32:56.538]  It funds the operation.
[00:32:56.538 --> 00:32:57.538]  X3.
[00:32:58.013 --> 00:32:59.094]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:02.036]  We also have TurboForce 10-Hour Clean Energy.
[00:33:02.337 --> 00:33:04.159]  We have the highest quality Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:11.806]  We have the Ultimate Bone Broth with the strongest concentrated bone broth with the Chaga Mushroom, with the Meat Pollen, with the Turmeric and more.
[00:33:12.126 --> 00:33:13.608]  And I just want to thank you all for your support.
[00:33:14.008 --> 00:33:15.349]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:30.517]   But more important than that, The millions of Steven Crowder listeners, he's so gracious to plug over and over again that my show's coming up from his studios and Gerald, his co-host, Gerald Morgan.
[00:33:31.482 --> 00:33:32.823]  We want to welcome you to InfoWars.
[00:33:32.843 --> 00:33:35.464]  I know many of you watched before, but do you watch on a regular basis?
[00:33:35.524 --> 00:33:37.486]  Do you share the links to Steven Crowder's show?
[00:33:37.506 --> 00:33:38.426]  Do you share the links to my show?
[00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:40.868]  Do you share the links to the other shows that are telling the truth?
[00:33:41.128 --> 00:33:42.749]  Because it's not just something you do sometimes.
[00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:44.049]  You should be doing it all the time.
[00:33:44.089 --> 00:33:46.791]  The entire enemy operation is about silencing us.
[00:33:47.051 --> 00:33:51.694]  So I just ask you to realize how much power you have and ask you to take off the governor and take it to the limit.
[00:33:52.074 --> 00:33:54.895]  All right, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, great friend of mine.
[00:33:55.255 --> 00:34:03.557]  I want to get him on the time we have the next 25 minutes here today to cover the Trump indictment and the latest show trial in D.C.
[00:34:03.757 --> 00:34:07.138]  with the so-called Sybil issue of assault for saying he's innocent.
[00:34:07.618 --> 00:34:14.862]   Obviously, the Elon Musk deal and this Global coordinator for the WEF coming in, who is a wokester.
[00:34:15.243 --> 00:34:16.163]  What do you think about that?
[00:34:16.183 --> 00:34:17.785]  What do you think about the open borders?
[00:34:18.185 --> 00:34:19.466]  What do you think about all these issues?
[00:34:19.286 --> 00:34:22.925]   So Robert Barnes, I've got a thousand places I'd go, but first off my friend, I want to
[00:34:22.925 --> 00:34:24.164]  see where you want to go first.
[00:34:24.164 --> 00:34:30.445]  Robert, can you hear me?
[00:34:30.445 --> 00:34:40.445]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:33.615 --> 00:34:34.675]  Barnes is on the road.
[00:34:35.976 --> 00:34:40.197]  His Skype froze up when he first got on.
[00:34:40.697 --> 00:34:41.557]  Just froze up again.
[00:34:42.297 --> 00:34:42.978]  But it's okay.
[00:34:43.478 --> 00:34:48.619]  We'll get him on the phone instead of going through the whole dance of an hour trying to fix his Skype or Zoom.
[00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:49.900]  So get him on the phone.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.820]  Who cares if we can see him?
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.460]  Get him on the phone right now.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.481]  That's my directive.
[00:34:53.501 --> 00:34:53.801]  Thank you.
[00:34:56.027 --> 00:35:02.368]  Continuing here with the news and information, ladies and gentlemen, I want to play a clip that we played on Steven Crowder's show.
[00:35:03.288 --> 00:35:06.489]  And it's clip 22.
[00:35:07.049 --> 00:35:15.651]  One of our security guys is an Army veteran, a great patriot friend of mine, was out with our crew and got sick of watching what was happening last Friday at the El Paso border.
[00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:19.811]  And he went up and talked to the state guard and they got in his face.
[00:35:20.211 --> 00:35:22.452]  But the truth is they're ignoring the governor's orders.
[00:35:22.712 --> 00:35:23.292]  Here's that clip.
[00:35:27.808 --> 00:35:29.069]  Who is your chief?
[00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:34.929]   You're going to put a place forward to slow down or ramp up these illegal immigrants.
[00:35:34.929 --> 00:35:36.929]  You're going to put them in open border control.
[00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:40.929]   Your job is to follow orders from the governor of Texas, which is the order you're having,
[00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:41.929]  which you guys are doing.
[00:35:41.929 --> 00:35:43.929]  And I know what the orders are put forth.
[00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:48.929]   And what orders were put out by the governor, who is your chief?
[00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:49.929]  He is your chief.
[00:35:49.929 --> 00:35:50.929]  Your commander-in-chief.
[00:35:51.615 --> 00:35:52.617]  You can roll your eyes all you want.
[00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:53.458]  I'm not rolling my eyes.
[00:35:53.539 --> 00:35:57.726]  But you guys don't understand, because you guys are in full active duty, like Elvis, what an order is.
[00:35:57.766 --> 00:35:59.829]  When the Chief Commander gives the order... Alright, so we're gonna...
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:26.227]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, The governor said in order to slow down the influx of illegal immigrants.
[00:36:26.347 --> 00:36:27.148]  You guys aren't doing that.
[00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:29.410]  Where's your pride in following orders, man?
[00:36:30.251 --> 00:36:30.832]  Come on, man.
[00:36:30.852 --> 00:36:35.076]  You're wearing a uniform to say and represent the state of Texas, not Border Patrol.
[00:36:35.496 --> 00:36:36.777]  Have some pride, gentlemen.
[00:36:37.158 --> 00:36:38.219]  The governor spoke.
[00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:39.480]  You need to follow those orders.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.062]  Thank you.
[00:36:40.902 --> 00:36:42.902]  That's what we do.
[00:36:42.902 --> 00:36:48.902]  [inaudible]
[00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:51.902]  Alright, so that important video has gone viral.
[00:36:52.146 --> 00:36:54.427]  It's at Man Up Video, but it's also on Twitter and everywhere else.
[00:36:54.447 --> 00:36:56.629]  And again, you can say what you want about Elon Musk.
[00:36:56.689 --> 00:36:57.549]  We have really seen...
[00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:07.069]  A major drop in Musk blocking people's videos and articles, so I don't think he's perfect, but we're certainly seeing a lot more coverage of that.
[00:37:07.089 --> 00:37:13.593]  We're going to skip this network break so we can gain back the time we've lost today, because I'm on the road and there's issues anytime that happens.
[00:37:13.993 --> 00:37:15.254]  But now let's go to Robert Barnes.
[00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:21.659]  Robert Barnes, front and center with all the crazy things going on in the world, what do you think the most important issue is right now?
[00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:45.129]  I mean, in part it will be whatever Musk is up to with Twitter in terms of preserving its free speech status, because if this new hire is in fact a shift away from a free speech direction, then Tucker needs to look elsewhere for his own show while he figures out how to escape Fox's no-compete provision.
[00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:54.152]  And looks at other alternatives, whether it's Patrick Bet-David, Rumble, One American News Network, Newsmax, or wherever else he decides to go.
[00:37:54.592 --> 00:38:08.497]  So I think that is key, and I am hopeful that she might be a quiet closet conservative just because she has liked an unusual number of religious comments, pro-free speech comments, other comments.
[00:38:09.336 --> 00:38:13.737]   As you know, there are plenty of people in the corporate media space who are closet conservatives
[00:38:13.737 --> 00:38:18.576]   who play the game in order to keep their job but behind the scenes don't actually share
[00:38:18.576 --> 00:38:25.436]   the politics of those that they are expressing in the advertising councils and world economic
[00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:28.175]  forums and NBCs of the world.
[00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:32.376]   So I hope that's the case or I hope our role is more limited or restricted than a role
[00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:37.297]   that would be more problematic because as you know, Twitter is not far from perfect
[00:38:37.297 --> 00:38:43.096]   but a lot better than where it was and of the big tech various social media platforms,
[00:38:43.096 --> 00:38:47.536]   the only one that is providing any meaningful First Amendment access of any kind.
[00:38:47.536 --> 00:38:49.496]  So we'll see how it goes.
[00:38:49.496 --> 00:38:54.896]   I mean, obviously the big alternatives like Rumble that Stephen Crowder has helped boost
[00:38:54.896 --> 00:38:56.576]  as well by his move to Rumble.
[00:38:56.576 --> 00:38:59.056]  I hope Tucker ultimately moves to Rumble.
[00:38:59.056 --> 00:39:02.137]   That makes a lot more sense long term because the network effect.
[00:39:02.643 --> 00:39:07.545]  It's so significant and substantial for a lot of these places where they can expand and extend.
[00:39:07.565 --> 00:39:14.467]  I mean, I always said one test for Rumble would be whether the InfoWars would be freely available on Rumble.
[00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:16.307]  They always have, hasn't been a problem.
[00:39:16.828 --> 00:39:24.330]  So I think Rumble is proving to be a better free speech platform than Twitter, a more reliable free speech platform than Twitter.
[00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:52.716]  And hopefully someone like Tucker can have a similar effect as Steve did in going forward to use them rather than Twitter, because I think even if I'm right in that she's a closet conservative, the move suggests a move towards being more politically neutral than free speech advocates, especially given what happened over the weekend and censoring tweets out of Turkey that he legally didn't even have to.
[00:39:54.197 --> 00:39:57.360]  I don't think she's as bad as a lot of people were worried about.
[00:39:58.081 --> 00:40:01.445]  I don't know any wokester that quotes religious verses every other day.
[00:40:01.925 --> 00:40:06.330]  That's what the new Twitter CEO does, like tweets of that regard.
[00:40:07.411 --> 00:40:15.059]  She liked tweets by Jack Posobiec, liked tweets that said make Orwell Orwellian again, liked tweets that were critical of ESG.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:29.631]  So all of that suggests it's possible she's not the person that her resume, the NBC World Economic Forum Advertising Council pro-mask, pro-vaccine resume, suggests that she is.
[00:40:30.912 --> 00:40:38.498]  And I would also note people should probably, it's probably useful for people to remember that, you know, Elon Musk has everybody's direct messages.
[00:40:38.899 --> 00:40:45.244]  So, you know, he would know what she has been like behind the scenes in private with a range of friends and family.
[00:40:45.825 --> 00:40:52.230]  But her Twitter-like feed does not suggest anyone that's a wokester at all.
[00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.032]  Suggests someone who is, in fact, a closet conservative.
[00:40:55.213 --> 00:40:57.213]  So I think that...
[00:40:57.213 --> 00:40:59.213]  Go ahead.
[00:40:59.213 --> 00:41:01.213]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:41:01.213 --> 00:41:12.213]   I was just going to say, Alex, that no doubt that her resume screams trouble.
[00:41:12.441 --> 00:41:15.828]  Hopefully she's secretly someone other than that resume suggests she is.
[00:41:18.032 --> 00:41:18.492]  Exactly.
[00:41:18.532 --> 00:41:19.553]  That's what I said Friday.
[00:41:19.593 --> 00:41:22.575]  We should wait and see because everything he's been doing overall is in good direction.
[00:41:22.595 --> 00:41:25.036]  And we have to be ready to win.
[00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:31.860]  We have to be ready as liberty becomes popular again and as tyranny becomes unpopular, which is happening, we've got to be ready for defections from their side.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:37.963]  We can't be sitting there not letting people join us, but then the proof will be in the pudding of how they behave and how they act.
[00:41:38.083 --> 00:41:40.665]  So I was open on the question until yesterday.
[00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:47.578]  What you just brought up where he then just shut down Twitter in Turkey when Erdogan was making demands and says, well that's what I have to do.
[00:41:47.618 --> 00:41:49.302]  Well, the EU is making demands of Twitter.
[00:41:51.164 --> 00:41:51.765]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:51.805 --> 00:42:03.116]  I mean, what I was encouraging him to do, and maybe he should debate Chris Pevlosky of Rumble about it, or the new CEO of Twitter should debate Chris Pevlosky of Rumble, because the same demand was made of them.
[00:42:03.616 --> 00:42:15.348]  They were told almost two years ago now, by the French government, the French government told Rumble, you better remove RT or you're going to lose all access to France.
[00:42:16.048 --> 00:42:21.734]  And Chris Pavlosky and Rumble's response was, well, au revoir, bye-bye France.
[00:42:22.175 --> 00:42:25.578]  They said, we're not going to censor at the demand of a government, period.
[00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:27.861]  They've told Canada the same thing.
[00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:30.143]  Rumble and Pavlosky started out in Canada.
[00:42:30.524 --> 00:42:37.251]  They said, you know, if Bill 11 goes through and you try to censor the content creation on Rumble, we're just going to leave Canada.
[00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:44.675]  We're not going to be in a country or government where they demand and condition access based on censorship.
[00:42:45.056 --> 00:42:48.218]  That's the stand I think Musk should take.
[00:42:48.478 --> 00:42:49.438]  And I can understand it.
[00:42:49.458 --> 00:42:51.200]  He's under a lot of economic pressure.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.701]  He's losing money hand over fist.
[00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:55.082]  The Biden administration is harassing him en masse.
[00:42:55.282 --> 00:42:57.764]  He may be reconsidering his commitment to free speech.
[00:42:58.604 --> 00:43:05.969]  That's where it's critical that what Steven Crowder did working with Rumble because Rumble's been the only consistent protector of free speech in this space.
[00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:08.699]  Exactly, so let's expand on that.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:15.582]  For a lot of listeners, they want to hear about the border, they want to hear about Russia, they want to hear about the dollar, they want to hear about Argentina raising interest rates 97%.
[00:43:15.622 --> 00:43:16.762]  That's all ultra-important.
[00:43:17.142 --> 00:43:25.064]  But the CIA, the globalists, the left, the Atlantic Council, they're obsessed with the internet and speech.
[00:43:25.384 --> 00:43:27.265]  Because if we don't have that, we lose.
[00:43:27.305 --> 00:43:28.225]  If we have it, we win.
[00:43:28.525 --> 00:43:29.266]  Freedom is populist.
[00:43:29.286 --> 00:43:32.927]  That's why I'm glad, out of all the topics, I knew, we didn't talk before we came on live here.
[00:43:34.567 --> 00:43:40.072]  That you'd probably go with Quarter First because, I mean, this really is the fight.
[00:43:40.453 --> 00:43:42.114]  And I think it depends on what we do.
[00:43:42.134 --> 00:43:47.159]  I think Musk is an opportunist and is going to go which way he thinks the wind blows.
[00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:52.244]  Well, it's up to us that aren't opportunists to actually go with what the moral right is.
[00:43:52.704 --> 00:43:54.165]  And so I think that's really a central issue.
[00:43:54.486 --> 00:43:55.486]  Let's shift gears here.
[00:43:56.294 --> 00:44:01.254]   into Trump. Obviously the fiasco we just saw in New York, but his numbers go up.
[00:44:01.254 --> 00:44:06.414]   You're the lawyer, I'm not a lawyer, but she says he's innocent and so a jury
[00:44:06.414 --> 00:44:10.133]   says there's no proof he raped her, but he defamed her by saying he didn't
[00:44:10.133 --> 00:44:15.173]   assault her with no evidence, no proof. She sent out social messages that she
[00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:18.813]   loved the apprentice and loved Trump years ago, decades after he supposedly
[00:44:18.813 --> 00:44:23.734]   finger raped her, sorry to use that term, but she says he did digitally raped her
[00:44:23.734 --> 00:44:28.130]   and she's on TV saying I love you know women love rape It's hot.
[00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.291]  I mean, she comes off.
[00:44:29.431 --> 00:44:37.575]  I mean, if I was trying to have central casting for you to make a new poltergeist where the prophet comes back, I mean, the woman comes off crazier than William Defoe.
[00:44:37.955 --> 00:44:40.997]  So all I'm saying is what is explaining to me the law?
[00:44:41.497 --> 00:44:43.958]  How a jury finds you guilty for saying you're innocent.
[00:44:44.178 --> 00:44:53.082]  I know in the Sandy Hook case in Connecticut, Judge Sandal, Stan, you may not say you're innocent, I found you guilty, but being defaming someone to say you're innocent?
[00:44:53.382 --> 00:44:57.604]  I mean, even if you're caught with ten dead bodies in your backyard, aren't you allowed to say you're innocent, whether civil or criminal?
[00:44:59.289 --> 00:45:00.950]  Yeah, there's many constitutional issues.
[00:45:01.011 --> 00:45:03.833]  What you're referencing, Alex, is called the exculpatory no.
[00:45:04.393 --> 00:45:07.716]  So it's that you're allowed to deny an allegation against you.
[00:45:07.836 --> 00:45:08.977]  The exculpatory no.
[00:45:09.298 --> 00:45:11.479]  And the court in this case overrode that.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.641]  Just denied that substantive defense.
[00:45:14.322 --> 00:45:21.588]  Similarly, because many of these claims were while he was President of the United States, under the Westfall Act, he's supposed to be immune from suit anyway.
[00:45:22.168 --> 00:45:23.770]  And the court ignored that as well.
[00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:37.615]  Then, as you note, she has a very disturbed record of public statements on her social media concerning Trump, concerning rape, concerning—she made other allegations that appear to be false against other people.
[00:45:38.076 --> 00:45:42.297]  She appeared to borrow these allegations from a Law & Order episode she was obsessed with.
[00:45:43.018 --> 00:45:48.540]  She's made a lot of—she's clearly a deviant in a lot of respects and mentally unstable in a lot of respects.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.242]  All of that evidence was excluded from the trial.
[00:45:51.662 --> 00:45:58.647]  By contrast, other crazy claims made by other crazy people was allowed into the trial against Trump.
[00:45:59.287 --> 00:46:04.291]  So the judge fixed and rigged the case as much as he possibly could.
[00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:08.531]  It was a politically outcome-derived case.
[00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:10.272]  Dershowitz has said the same thing.
[00:46:10.332 --> 00:46:13.173]  It's all part of Get Trump, the movement in New York, to nail him.
[00:46:13.673 --> 00:46:17.335]  I mean, you can see her, like, wild-eyes interaction with Anderson Cooper.
[00:46:17.355 --> 00:46:22.958]  And even Anderson Cooper, who hates Trump, knew she's batshit insane and was trying to go to a break before she said it.
[00:46:22.978 --> 00:46:24.299]  And had to cut the segment short.
[00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:27.564]  Completely!
[00:46:27.624 --> 00:46:29.324]  He was trying to hit the button as fast as he could.
[00:46:29.645 --> 00:46:30.465]  Get out of here!
[00:46:30.645 --> 00:46:31.205]  Get us out of here!
[00:46:31.485 --> 00:46:33.466]  Because of how nuts she was.
[00:46:34.547 --> 00:46:35.067]  Think about it.
[00:46:35.087 --> 00:46:48.173]  You have a liberal, democratic, Trump-hating jury, and even they couldn't convict or find him liable for any form of sexual assault or rape because of how crazy they knew she was and how lying she knew she was.
[00:46:48.533 --> 00:47:06.006]  I mean, on that day, the other thing the judge excluded that's all part of going to be part of the appeal is Trump's lawyers wanted to establish that the custom and protocols at that particular store would have had a personal shopper walking around with Trump, multiple levels of security near Trump, multiple levels of security near the dressing rooms.
[00:47:06.366 --> 00:47:09.129]  That they never left it abandoned the way she described.
[00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:13.473]  That it was simply impossible for what to have happened to have happened to her.
[00:47:13.853 --> 00:47:17.476]  All of that evidence was also excluded by the judge from trial.
[00:47:17.836 --> 00:47:23.862]  So that the judge was obsessed with fixing the case and even though they wanted to fix the case, as you note, it's a contradictory verdict.
[00:47:24.463 --> 00:47:25.803]  He said he didn't rape her.
[00:47:26.123 --> 00:47:27.904]  The jury says he didn't rape her.
[00:47:28.184 --> 00:47:35.685]  But the jury found him liable for quote unquote defaming her and lying about her by saying what the jury said was actually true.
[00:47:36.305 --> 00:47:37.885]  So it just... So what does this say?
[00:47:37.945 --> 00:47:39.226]  What does this say in law?
[00:47:39.746 --> 00:47:42.046]  Because as a normal person, I see it's injustice.
[00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:44.747]  I'm a victim of lawfare.
[00:47:45.547 --> 00:47:47.387]  Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, we all are.
[00:47:48.207 --> 00:47:49.827]  What does this say about the weaponization?
[00:47:49.847 --> 00:47:50.668]  It's not getting better.
[00:47:50.708 --> 00:47:51.508]  It's getting much worse.
[00:47:51.948 --> 00:47:52.848]  What does that lead to?
[00:47:54.318 --> 00:47:56.439]  Well, you know, it ties into the top of the conversation.
[00:47:56.898 --> 00:48:01.657]   Just as we said from day one in 2018, when social media, Twitter, et cetera,
[00:48:01.657 --> 00:48:07.498]   led the war to de-platform Alex Jones and InfoWars, with the goal being to silence, censor, and shame
[00:48:07.498 --> 00:48:13.338]   the InfoWars audience into running away, as the law lawyers themselves admitted their goal was,
[00:48:13.338 --> 00:48:16.659]   their goal wasn't to collect money, their goal wasn't to get recovery,
[00:48:16.659 --> 00:48:19.938]   their goal wasn't to determine the truth or to get to justice,
[00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:25.737]   their goal was to silence you by censoring and shaming your audience into running away
[00:48:25.737 --> 00:48:27.138]  from supporting you.
[00:48:27.138 --> 00:48:32.098]   Unfortunately for them, they failed because people continue to go to infowarsstore.com
[00:48:32.098 --> 00:48:35.297]   and get things that support them, make their lives healthier, wealthier,
[00:48:35.297 --> 00:48:37.138]  and wiser in the process.
[00:48:37.138 --> 00:48:40.577]   So their effort failed, but only because the audience was so strong.
[00:48:40.577 --> 00:48:47.418]   The same law, just as they were going to use the very means and template of going after you
[00:48:47.418 --> 00:48:49.858]   to go after everyone else, just two years later,
[00:48:49.858 --> 00:48:53.938]   taking out the President of the United States, they're using the lawfare map
[00:48:53.938 --> 00:48:56.538]  to also go after everyone they don't like.
[00:48:56.423 --> 00:49:01.088]  I mean, Trump is facing this bogus civil case, another bogus criminal case.
[00:49:01.108 --> 00:49:04.491]  He's looking at the bogus civil case in New York by the Attorney General.
[00:49:04.772 --> 00:49:07.775]  He's looking at a potential bogus case out of the District of Columbia.
[00:49:08.215 --> 00:49:11.279]  All this overt, open... I mean, we see it with the subway gentleman.
[00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:15.383]  I mean, that is a man that if he was black and the other person was white, he's not prosecuted.
[00:49:15.763 --> 00:49:20.447]  If he was in any place other than New York City with Alvin Bragg, his DA, he's not prosecuted.
[00:49:21.168 --> 00:49:26.412]  And he's on video with black and Hispanics, so let me bring that up here.
[00:49:27.032 --> 00:49:30.976]  Trump ordered a pure Manhattan criminal case to be schooled for use of evidence.
[00:49:31.376 --> 00:49:39.783]  This is the gag order you and others had warned of, it's totally unconstitutional, saying when they attack him in the press with the evidence they leak and give to the public, he's not allowed to respond.
[00:49:39.823 --> 00:49:40.724]  What does Trump do about this?
[00:49:42.422 --> 00:49:43.283]  Two different challenges.
[00:49:43.323 --> 00:49:52.653]  He's removed the case to federal district court, but the way it works in criminal cases is the state court can continue to take action until the federal court decides whether to take up the case.
[00:49:53.233 --> 00:49:57.873]   I hope the federal court operates on an accelerated timetable because it's clear this judge is
[00:49:57.873 --> 00:50:04.233]   a power-mad judge who wants to use and abuse his power and will continue to do so, misuse
[00:50:04.233 --> 00:50:06.992]  and abuse his power, unless the federal court steps in.
[00:50:06.992 --> 00:50:10.193]   So hopefully the federal court steps in and says, "No, this case doesn't even belong in
[00:50:10.193 --> 00:50:14.952]   state court," removes it from state court, doesn't allow state court to assert any more
[00:50:14.952 --> 00:50:19.193]   power over him because the state court's already violating Trump's First Amendment rights merely
[00:50:19.193 --> 00:50:20.193]  by these threats.
[00:50:20.193 --> 00:50:23.952]   If he's stuck in state court, he should challenge it on First Amendment grounds.
[00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.933]  Maybe even look at a separate independent federal civil rights suit.
[00:50:27.194 --> 00:50:29.276]  You can do that against a judge in certain instances.
[00:50:29.576 --> 00:50:30.978]  Go try to go up directly to the U.S.
[00:50:30.998 --> 00:50:31.699]  Supreme Court.
[00:50:31.899 --> 00:50:32.379]  All of that.
[00:50:32.399 --> 00:50:35.223]  And you're going to see the same thing in the subway case.
[00:50:35.703 --> 00:50:37.324]  So we'll see what they do in the subway case.
[00:50:37.344 --> 00:50:56.897]  But as you pointed out, the people who helped participate in securing the very dangerous homeless man who was threatening everyone on that train and had a long criminal history of physically assaulting and hurting people on that train, threatening himself, threatening to commit crimes, all of which was a basis to exercise means of physical restraint upon him.
[00:50:57.358 --> 00:51:01.701]  The other people who helped him were an African American and Latino man on that train.
[00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:09.183]  And the other primary people whose lives he saved included African-American men and women, Latino men and women.
[00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:21.286]  And yet he, this marine hero, this subway savior, is being criminally prosecuted by a district attorney that only cares about weaponizing his office to achieve political consequences.
[00:51:21.306 --> 00:51:23.046]  So this is, yeah, this is Carl Rittenhouse 2.0.
[00:51:23.126 --> 00:51:25.967]  Why would Bragg do something so overtly unpopular?
[00:51:25.987 --> 00:51:28.047]  They just can't help it.
[00:51:28.087 --> 00:51:30.568]  It's like they've chosen evil as the default.
[00:51:32.249 --> 00:51:32.649]  Exactly.
[00:51:32.669 --> 00:51:45.936]  I mean, years ago when I was representing the so-called Central Park Karen, Amy Cooper, I got that case resolved so that all charges were dismissed with prejudice and that the New York DA's office would have no more control over her legally of any kind.
[00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:50.398]  I refused all plea agreements, diversion agreements, I refused every one of those.
[00:51:50.879 --> 00:51:53.580]  And the reason was because I had studied the politics of what was coming.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:52:03.803]  And I knew that the old Robert Morgenthau-style office in New York that had this independent, apolitical reputation that was the basis for the TV show Law & Order in the first place was going to be gone.
[00:52:04.203 --> 00:52:13.446]  And that Alvin Bragg was going to be a very dangerous George Soros-elected district attorney who was going to politically weaponize the office to serve the interests of his George Soros-aligned crowd.
[00:52:13.806 --> 00:52:15.027]  That's who his real audience is.
[00:52:15.167 --> 00:52:16.908]  His audience is not the people of New York.
[00:52:17.348 --> 00:52:18.629]  It's not the media of New York.
[00:52:18.709 --> 00:52:21.390]  His audience is what does George Soros and his allies want.
[00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:22.511]  And that's what he does.
[00:52:23.011 --> 00:52:25.833]  If George Soros and his allies demand an indictment of Trump... That's incredible.
[00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:28.834]  I know you've got to go soon, and Owen Troyer just got back from the border.
[00:52:28.874 --> 00:52:30.515]  He's loaded for bear, but do five more minutes with us.
[00:52:30.875 --> 00:52:32.076]  We've got a minute till break, though.
[00:52:33.237 --> 00:52:34.918]  What do you think of the border collapse?
[00:52:35.158 --> 00:52:37.719]  I mean, obviously it's blown up in Biden's face, but he doesn't care.
[00:52:38.419 --> 00:52:39.140]  What's your view on that?
[00:52:40.464 --> 00:52:41.404]  So I mean, good news there.
[00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:48.246]  The federal court out of Florida just on Friday issued an order preventing a Biden administration from paroling everybody.
[00:52:48.266 --> 00:52:49.626]  I mean, it's all the catch.
[00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:52.987]  The real real problem isn't necessarily Title 42 remain in Mexico.
[00:52:53.307 --> 00:53:05.310]  The problem is these parole rules that the Biden administration keeps putting in this, these catch and release rules that allow them allow people to be quickly processed into the United States just on the promise they're going to come back for a hearing.
[00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.790]  Everybody knows they're never coming back for.
[00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.472]  And the reason they're not coming back for that hearing is because they know they can't win the hearing legally.
[00:53:10.992 --> 00:53:13.094]  And so, I don't begrudge the immigrants.
[00:53:13.134 --> 00:53:14.855]  These are people who are just trying to survive.
[00:53:14.895 --> 00:53:22.359]  But it's our job as Americans to protect our borders, secure our country, keep our cities safe, and keep our jobs for Americans.
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.281]  And that's not what's happening with this.
[00:53:24.661 --> 00:53:27.803]  I would tell people out there, don't take the bait on E-Verify.
[00:53:27.923 --> 00:53:29.604]  There's a lot of problems with E-Verify.
[00:53:29.624 --> 00:53:33.726]  It's the federal government trying to get a database they can use to... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:53:33.746 --> 00:53:34.547]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:53:34.907 --> 00:53:37.708]  Do five more minutes because I'm going to let you host this segment so I don't interrupt you.
[00:53:38.228 --> 00:53:49.212]  Come back and explain this issue, also 2024 election, what other tricks you think the deep state has, the patriot front, obviously I believe a social engineering provocateur group, Robert Barnes straight ahead, then Owen Schroeder.
[00:53:49.232 --> 00:53:49.572]  Stay with us.
[00:53:50.592 --> 00:53:52.353]  Robert Barnes is going to finish up in this five minutes.
[00:53:53.717 --> 00:53:55.338]  Robert Barnes is going to finish up in this five minutes.
[00:53:56.419 --> 00:53:58.320]  And I couldn't tell, they keep talking to me in my ear.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.162]  And then we're going to have Owen Troyer coming in here right after this.
[00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:08.866]  Barnes, the collapsing borders, the exploding crime, the fentanyl, the blue cities, he's fighting the police.
[00:54:09.306 --> 00:54:11.407]  It's clear they admit they want to collapse the country.
[00:54:12.167 --> 00:54:13.628]  It's clear they want to collapse the country.
[00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:20.132]  And so your response in the four minutes to break, your last segment here, just as a gestalt of why they're doing this.
[00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:24.079]  Yeah, well, look, as an example, look at E-Verify.
[00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:31.722]  They're creating a crisis of illegal immigration that's invading the labor force and the labor supply, undermining United States wages.
[00:54:32.082 --> 00:54:39.285]  Real income of ordinary people is down now for 25 consecutive quarters, the longest stretch in the history of keeping that stat.
[00:54:39.425 --> 00:54:42.947]  If we had adjusted statistical data, it goes back to the Great Depression.
[00:54:43.327 --> 00:54:48.947]   what ordinary working class Americans have just experienced over the last two years under the Biden administration,
[00:54:48.947 --> 00:54:53.266]   which is in their real income, their purchasing power of their labor
[00:54:53.266 --> 00:54:56.586]  has declined for two consecutive years.
[00:54:56.586 --> 00:55:00.386]  Every single quarter in those two years is declined.
[00:55:00.386 --> 00:55:07.087]   And part of why is because the continuous influx of illegal immigration, many from Central America,
[00:55:07.087 --> 00:55:10.666]  into the US labor economy without consequence.
[00:55:10.666 --> 00:55:15.267]   What that's produced is heavy demand for some form of immigrant enforcement,
[00:55:15.267 --> 00:55:19.506]   including internal enforcement against illegal access to the labor market
[00:55:19.506 --> 00:55:21.747]  through programs like E-Verify.
[00:55:21.747 --> 00:55:25.067]   But like other dynamics, whenever they try to create a crisis,
[00:55:25.067 --> 00:55:30.787]   whether it's a pandemic, whether it's supposed terrorism, whether it's communism, sometimes the threat may be real,
[00:55:30.787 --> 00:55:35.046]   like illegal immigration's threat to the labor market in the United States is a real threat
[00:55:35.046 --> 00:55:36.787]  that we should do something about.
[00:55:36.741 --> 00:55:44.103]  However, they're going to always propose solutions that aren't really solutions to those problems, but they give the globalists a power grab.
[00:55:44.503 --> 00:55:46.684]  And that is precisely what E-Verify is.
[00:55:47.184 --> 00:55:51.105]  What E-Verify does, for example, is it basically federalizes employment.
[00:55:51.741 --> 00:56:03.403]  Now in America, employers all across the country can't employ somebody unless they get first the permission of the United States federal government to say, yes, that person has been verified.
[00:56:03.823 --> 00:56:10.244]  That sounds an awful lot like the the incremental instrument of a social credit score system.
[00:56:11.005 --> 00:56:18.586]  It's almost as bad as a central bank digital currency to control your ability to work, to control your ability to employ people.
[00:56:18.966 --> 00:56:24.610]  That the system already, it's illegal already, it's a crime already to knowingly hire illegal aliens.
[00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:29.654]  The e-verified criminal punishment is not limited to whether or not you hire an illegal alien.
[00:56:30.034 --> 00:56:37.479]  If you simply hire someone the federal government has told you you can't, is not quote-unquote verified, then that's when you go to prison.
[00:56:37.879 --> 00:56:46.004]  They're using illegal immigration as a smokescreen, a legitimate threat, but for an illegitimate purpose of globalist control.
[00:56:46.445 --> 00:57:00.233]  That they want to, just as they want the illegal immigration to dilute the labor supply, dilute the people's voting powers, dilute the social local community cohesion that exists in order for globalists to come in and seize control over those systems.
[00:57:00.614 --> 00:57:07.258]  They're also using it in disguise by getting conservatives to take the bait on Patriot Act type employment reforms.
[00:57:07.498 --> 00:57:09.719]  That aren't really about illegal immigration.
[00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:18.562]  For example, this E-Verify bill completely excludes the entire agriculture sector, which is the only sector that could plausibly benefit for U.S.
[00:57:18.622 --> 00:57:20.883]  labor workers from its enforcement.
[00:57:21.363 --> 00:57:24.524]  So what they're going to do is they're going to, and ultimately guess what they're saying?
[00:57:24.564 --> 00:57:28.265]  They're saying E-Verify creates the need for photo identification.
[00:57:28.305 --> 00:57:29.546]  That doesn't work well enough.
[00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:35.508]  Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers don't work well enough because it creates a demand for identity theft.
[00:57:35.948 --> 00:57:41.354]  And they're going to use the existence of identity theft for e-verify to say we really need a biometric system.
[00:57:41.714 --> 00:57:48.361]  We need a biometric system on every single American so that you, in the future, you will not be allowed to work.
[00:57:49.113 --> 00:57:52.315]  Unless you are part of the biometric government-approved system.
[00:57:52.755 --> 00:58:15.145]  So be careful and be alert to these tricks and disguises that can come out that are supposedly about doing something you're for, stopping illegal immigration's effect on the labor market, and are really for pushing through something that you're against, which is the concentration of information, the attempts to federalize, nationalize, and give the globalists control of our ability to even work for ourselves and others.
[00:58:15.485 --> 00:58:17.986]  So stay alert, as always, in the InfoWars audience.
[00:58:20.533 --> 00:58:22.533]  to stop illegals and all he does up at the border.
[00:58:22.533 --> 00:58:23.693]  Robert Barnes, thanks for your time.
[00:58:23.693 --> 00:58:24.693]  God bless.
[00:58:24.693 --> 00:58:39.813]  We'll be right back with more Shorter.

[00:58:52.674 --> 00:58:59.036]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.

[00:59:19.208 --> 00:59:22.391]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.

[00:59:24.773 --> 00:59:25.574]  It's about to sell out.

[00:59:39.822 --> 00:59:43.925]  And I am in Stephen Crowder's North Texas Studios, hosted his show today.
[00:59:43.965 --> 00:59:44.925]  Great honor to do that.
[00:59:45.366 --> 00:59:47.647]  I'm now hosting my broadcast here.
[00:59:47.827 --> 00:59:51.449]  Owen Schroer is back in the Austin, Texas headquarters.
[00:59:51.709 --> 00:59:53.511]  He just got back from the border Saturday.
[00:59:54.271 --> 00:59:55.292]  They knocked it out of the park.
[00:59:55.672 --> 01:00:00.335]  I have to say, them fours was the number one reporting group, breaking through what really happened on the border.
[01:00:01.095 --> 01:00:05.478]  Just tens of millions of views of the work they did, really exposing what's happening.
[01:00:05.498 --> 01:00:08.420]  It got picked up and amplified on cable news everywhere else.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.764]  So great job to the crew for what they did.
[01:00:13.705 --> 01:00:18.670]  But I want to put on screen for people an article that just went live on Infowars.com.
[01:00:19.211 --> 01:00:22.554]  We talk about the whole sexualization of children.
[01:00:23.435 --> 01:00:30.342]  Remember Jocelyn Elders, the nominee to be the Surgeon General of Bill Clinton in 93, said we need to masturbate six-month-old children.
[01:00:33.311 --> 01:00:36.273]  Nursery schools, the hospitals need to touch the children's genitals.
[01:00:36.714 --> 01:00:42.318]  Now that sounded insane back then, but the government, literally, if they can grab your children's genitals, they can do anything.
[01:00:42.378 --> 01:00:48.483]  It's all about power, it's all about jurisdiction, it's all about dominance.
[01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:49.584]  It's all about territory.
[01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:51.846]  Early childhood masturbation.
[01:00:52.366 --> 01:01:00.433]  World Health Organization, the UN, calls for early childhood masturbation for toddlers, encourages questions about gender identity for kids aged four and up.
[01:01:01.331 --> 01:01:10.891]  And that's what the schools are doing all over the Western world to wreck your children's minds and destroy their innocence and literally have them form a sexual relationship about their identity with the state.
[01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:18.943]  Backlash has ensued following the renewed focus of the World Health Organization on sexuality education.
[01:01:19.003 --> 01:01:23.447]  Just a month ago they put out a report saying children should be able to decide whether to have sex with adults or not.
[01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:27.051]  Guidance for schools provide that children as young as four years old.
[01:01:27.071 --> 01:01:35.559]  A report by the Daily Mail, the guidance states that children under four should be encouraged to ask questions about sexuality and explore gender identities.
[01:01:35.579 --> 01:01:37.240]  This is pure evil.
[01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:41.969]  A 68-page report titled Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe.
[01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:43.572]  We'll put it on screen for viewers.
[01:01:44.273 --> 01:01:47.619]  Also calls for supplying information to toddlers about...
[01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:54.556]   "Enjoyment and pleasure when touching one's own body, early childhood masturbation."
[01:01:54.556 --> 01:02:00.317]   The policy paper also states that kids between four and six should talk about sexual matters
[01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:02.637]  and consult their gender identity.
[01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:06.195]   That's the state confusing their child with their different gender so they can then mutilate
[01:02:06.195 --> 01:02:07.355]  them and sterilize them.
[01:02:07.355 --> 01:02:10.637]   The document also asserts that sexuality is present from birth.
[01:02:10.637 --> 01:02:13.076]   That's what all these liberals say, "Oh, my newborn's really a boy or a girl and they're
[01:02:13.076 --> 01:02:13.757]  the other sex."
[01:02:14.165 --> 01:02:19.354]  From birth, this is a quote, from birth babies learn the value of pleasure of bodily contact.
[01:02:19.394 --> 01:02:20.235]  This is all pedophilic.
[01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:21.870]  Warmth and intimacy.
[01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:26.252]  So the mother hugging their baby is the same as someone having sex with them.
[01:02:26.712 --> 01:02:30.294]  Soon after that, they learn it's clean and what is dirty.
[01:02:30.494 --> 01:02:33.875]  Adding, in other words, they are engaging in sexual education.
[01:02:34.275 --> 01:02:39.898]  The WHO told reporters that our guidelines reflect established psychological facts based on decades of research.
[01:02:39.918 --> 01:02:40.778]  Trust the science.
[01:02:40.818 --> 01:02:41.398]  Take the shot.
[01:02:41.418 --> 01:02:42.819]  5G is good for you.
[01:02:43.499 --> 01:02:49.079]   covering the issue, GB News reporter Mark Dolan called the establishment sick and
[01:02:49.079 --> 01:02:53.438]   urged the WHO to go to hell. Yeah, Trump pulled out of it, Biden put us back under
[01:02:53.438 --> 01:02:57.559]   it. We'll get Mark Dolan clip that's in the article and show that on air, but
[01:02:57.559 --> 01:03:02.038]   what I really want to show on air is the link, it's the second link in the third
[01:03:02.038 --> 01:03:09.559]   paragraph, the 68 page report titled "Standards for Sexuality Education Europe."
[01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:10.322]  Because we don't want to just read you an article and claim that's what it's saying.
[01:03:10.822 --> 01:03:15.727]  You need to go to the source document and you need to read that for yourself.
[01:03:15.747 --> 01:03:16.848]  So we can put it on screen, please.
[01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:22.253]   It is the article titled, W.H.O.
[01:03:22.313 --> 01:03:29.318]  pushes early childhood masturbation for toddlers, encourages questions about gender identity for kids, and then there is the actual U.N.
[01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.340]  report in your face.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:38.725]  In the last report, a month and a half ago, they said that adults having sex with children is good and something we should do.
[01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:40.746]  So, this is it.
[01:03:41.187 --> 01:03:41.847]  There's no doubt.
[01:03:41.867 --> 01:03:42.928]  We have to protect our children.
[01:03:43.308 --> 01:03:45.850]  Public schools, most private schools, they're all overrun.
[01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:52.733]   It's all controlled, and this ties into the border, where our federal sources, it's been in the news as well, say 20,000
[01:03:52.733 --> 01:03:55.593]   pedophiles, last two and a half years under Biden have been released.
[01:03:55.593 --> 01:03:59.592]   The Texas sector alone, many of them with children, they estimate 30,000.
[01:03:59.592 --> 01:04:03.672]   Senate report confirms Obama turned over tens of thousands of children to sexual predators.
[01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:05.353]  Now that's expanded under Biden.
[01:04:05.353 --> 01:04:08.712]   Trump basically shut it down as much as he could, 95% or more.
[01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:10.273]  So this is what this is all about.
[01:04:10.273 --> 01:04:12.872]  So they say, "Oh, be nice to migrants, be sweet to them.
[01:04:12.872 --> 01:04:15.753]   Let them secretly come in, let them hand off babies to total strangers."
[01:04:15.753 --> 01:04:21.233]   No, this is giant human trafficking with the Border Patrol, with the federal troops and
[01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:23.912]  the national and state guards under federal control.
[01:04:23.884 --> 01:04:29.727]  Owen Schroer, give us a synopsis and a boil down of your four days at the border and the harrowing information you saw.
[01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:37.973]   Well, first off, that World Health Organization report about Early childhood masturbation?
[01:04:38.313 --> 01:04:40.535]  I mean, I can't even believe we're having these conversations now.
[01:04:40.555 --> 01:04:42.856]  The things that are wrong with that are so self-evident.
[01:04:43.377 --> 01:04:45.238]  And I guess this is what the left does, Alex.
[01:04:45.278 --> 01:04:46.499]  It's the same story at the border.
[01:04:46.779 --> 01:05:01.829]  I can't believe I have to come on air or stand there at that gate and explain that this is an invasion or explain how Border Patrol, in live time, is now being used against the American people and for illegal immigration.
[01:05:01.889 --> 01:05:04.651]  But yet, here we are, Alex, having to explain just that.
[01:05:05.956 --> 01:05:09.357]  Now the sad thing is this is going to happen tonight.
[01:05:09.517 --> 01:05:10.778]  It's going to happen tomorrow night.
[01:05:10.938 --> 01:05:13.979]  It's going to happen Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night.
[01:05:14.019 --> 01:05:17.340]  It's not going to stop happening just because our cameras aren't there.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.461]  It's not going to stop happening just because of this Title 42 hype.
[01:05:22.321 --> 01:05:24.342]  None of this is going to stop happening.
[01:05:24.482 --> 01:05:32.822]   Now they're arguing that Deportations are up, and illegal entries are down, but why should we trust them?
[01:05:33.102 --> 01:05:35.042]  Why should I trust Alejandro Mayorkas?
[01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:36.943]  Why should I trust the mainstream media?
[01:05:37.003 --> 01:05:41.884]  No, no, our sources have told them upwards of 80% get away, and they never make contact with them.
[01:05:42.465 --> 01:05:46.486]  So if they say 4,000 a day at that one checkpoint, it's three, four times that.
[01:05:47.304 --> 01:05:57.012]  And if they're arguing that giving them a notice to appear for court four years from now, we're up to the year 2028, I saw one that I think had a 2030 date on it, I don't know.
[01:05:57.412 --> 01:06:00.435]  The point is, none of them are going to show up to these court dates.
[01:06:00.455 --> 01:06:00.615]  No, it's 2035.
[01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:02.016]  A lot of them are going to be given 2035 dates.
[01:06:03.117 --> 01:06:04.879]  None of them are going to be showing up to these court dates.
[01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.580]  It's completely absurd.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.261]  We won't even have a country at this rate in 2028.
[01:06:08.642 --> 01:06:10.123]  What, you're not going to show up for your court date?
[01:06:10.143 --> 01:06:11.844]  You're not going to show up for your court date in 12 years?
[01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:15.966]  Oh, but that's processing them, Alex.
[01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:17.448]  That's addressing the problem.
[01:06:17.688 --> 01:06:18.789]  Oh, we gave him a court date.
[01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:20.031]  We gave him a notice to appear.
[01:06:20.111 --> 01:06:21.833]  See, we're protecting the border.
[01:06:22.033 --> 01:06:23.154]  The border is secure.
[01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:29.661]  So, it's happening every night, just like it was happening every night when we were down there in 2021.
[01:06:29.901 --> 01:06:32.644]  And it was the same story every day, every night, 24-7.
[01:06:32.685 --> 01:06:43.632]   So, I mean, look, there's going to be some Legal changes now that title 42 is expired and I guess they're using title 8 but but that's just that's just noise Alex That's just static on your TV.
[01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.014]  It's in a legal immigration pipeline.
[01:06:46.434 --> 01:06:49.776]  It's a border invasion We know who's facilitating it.
[01:06:50.016 --> 01:06:51.337]  We know who's running it.
[01:06:51.737 --> 01:07:03.271]   It's the most obvious scam I've ever seen in the world and shame on all the people that are saying yeah We're gonna turn the we're gonna turn our head the other way because we're profiting off of this, which you know is a lot of Americans sadly. A
[01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:07.692]   lot of Americans in government, a lot of Americans in the private sector, and
[01:07:07.692 --> 01:07:13.082]   now you have Democrats suing. Of course they're they're representing the
[01:07:13.082 --> 01:07:16.601]   illegal immigrants though Alex.
[01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:25.221]  But they're suing Republicans who are trying to pass legislation to make it illegal for hotels to be rented out for illegal immigrants, like in New York, where they just kicked out veterans.
[01:07:25.602 --> 01:07:29.225]  They kicked out homeless veterans for illegal immigrants.
[01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.266]  And people about to have weddings.
[01:07:30.306 --> 01:07:34.490]  So we're going to come back for a break and talk about this, but Owen, here's the $60 trillion question.
[01:07:35.543 --> 01:07:37.024]  The $64 trillion question.
[01:07:37.584 --> 01:07:46.569]  We know, whether we went there three years ago, it was basically shut down, or two years ago, wide open, last year wide open, where do they all go once they're not in hotels?
[01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:47.870]  It's the same program in Europe.
[01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:48.850]  Bring them in, put them in hotels.
[01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:49.651]  Where do they go?
[01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:50.991]  Where do the children go?
[01:07:51.011 --> 01:07:54.813]  Where random people hand babies off at the airport to random NGOs?
[01:07:55.214 --> 01:07:58.215]  I mean, the level of this is just mind-blowing.
[01:07:58.255 --> 01:07:59.136]  Where do they go, Owen?
[01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:00.476]  That's really the big question.
[01:08:00.536 --> 01:08:01.237]  Where do they go?
[01:08:01.737 --> 01:08:03.658]  Well, we do have a bit of an idea of this now.
[01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:09.403]  There's a process that gets them deep into the United States.
[01:08:09.663 --> 01:08:15.809]  A lot of times they literally will just get dropped off at a burger joint, a gas station, and just get a bus ticket.
[01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:18.472]  If they have family here, they'll try to stay with family.
[01:08:18.512 --> 01:08:20.654]  If they can find a friend here, they'll try to stay with a friend.
[01:08:21.475 --> 01:08:25.439]  You know there's different types of groups that are probably helping them.
[01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:28.863]  But where are the one-year-old babies that you shot and I shot and our crew shot?
[01:08:29.423 --> 01:08:35.068]  Where the same woman all day comes in every hour on a flight, goes and hands a baby over, no paperwork to an NGO.
[01:08:35.388 --> 01:08:37.450]  Where does the six-month-old, two-year-old baby go?
[01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:42.414]  Boy, you know, maybe Alejandro Mayorkas should answer that question, Alex.
[01:08:42.494 --> 01:08:48.178]  Maybe he should be doing a press conference down at that gate where we just were, and all the other media was as well.
[01:08:48.198 --> 01:08:48.779]  No, no, no.
[01:08:48.839 --> 01:08:50.500]  Instead, he said the border is controlled.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.441]  He said the border is fine.
[01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:54.225]  And they gaslit us down there, Alex.
[01:08:54.365 --> 01:08:59.028]  They like to play this whack-a-mole game with us where they say, oh, there's going to be a press conference over at Gate 42.
[01:08:59.089 --> 01:09:01.270]  And, oh, never mind, there's going to be a press conference at Gate 40.
[01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:05.032]  Then, well, actually, there's not a press conference, but there might be a Border Patrol agent coming through here.
[01:09:06.073 --> 01:09:07.754]  So they play all these games.
[01:09:08.074 --> 01:09:08.995]  They got caught, Alex.
[01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.436]  We caught them in the dead of night.
[01:09:11.517 --> 01:09:11.977]  Absolutely.
[01:09:12.017 --> 01:09:15.279]  Let's talk about that when you come back, because Owen, you guys knocked it out of the park.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.460]  Great job, crew.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:16.980]  We'll be right back.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.321]  Stay with us.
[01:09:18.101 --> 01:09:22.205]  Alright, so welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, hosting live from Sebring Crowders, Texas.
[01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:26.508]  Undisclosed location, Owen Troyer riding shotgun with a special guest, border expert.
[01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.830]  Next segment.
[01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:36.918]  Owen, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that Biden for two and a half years has been the number one threat to white supremacists, despite the fact none of the evidence showing that.
[01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:40.651]  And now, if we don't like them, the borders were white supremacist.
[01:09:41.212 --> 01:09:42.973]  I'm really concerned about a false flag.
[01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:52.442]  Before I get your take on that, let's go ahead and roll this clip of Biden and his little university outfit, a black university, spouting his garbage Saturday.
[01:09:52.262 --> 01:09:59.021]   So stand up against the poison of white supremacy as I did my inaugural address to a single
[01:09:59.021 --> 01:10:12.821]   out as the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:17.382]  I'm not saying this because I'm a black HBCU.
[01:10:17.383 --> 01:10:18.907]  I say it wherever I go.
[01:10:19.869 --> 01:10:21.272]  Stand up against the poison!
[01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:27.518]  They are basically framing the whole thing around this.
[01:10:28.218 --> 01:10:30.659]  What do you expect to happen next, and what else did you witness at the border?
[01:10:30.679 --> 01:10:34.101]  Because you guys probably followed 60 videos, I've watched almost all of them.
[01:10:34.782 --> 01:10:38.864]  Some videos have 10,000 views, some have a half million views, just on our own site, Man.Video.
[01:10:39.264 --> 01:10:42.446]  But millions of views out there, great job exposing it.
[01:10:42.786 --> 01:10:45.047]  But the question is, why weren't there more people exposing it?
[01:10:45.467 --> 01:10:47.368]  Why wasn't mainstream media able to show this?
[01:10:47.408 --> 01:10:48.369]  Well, they obviously didn't want to.
[01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:52.506]  Well, I mean, I don't know where you want me to start.
[01:10:52.746 --> 01:10:57.192]  Biden doing the typical dog whistle there at the HBCU.
[01:10:57.272 --> 01:10:59.415]  It's really just insulting to black people.
[01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:04.782]  It's kind of ridiculous that they'd be cheering that on, that obvious fake pandering.
[01:11:05.203 --> 01:11:10.962]   This is a guy who's actually had connections to members of the KKK.
[01:11:10.962 --> 01:11:14.622]  It's well known he eulogized Robert Byrd.
[01:11:14.622 --> 01:11:19.323]   So for him to be doing that, it's just offensive actually to black people.
[01:11:19.323 --> 01:11:23.283]   But he gets away with it, I guess, because that audience is sadly so uninformed.
[01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:28.523]   I mean, as far as what we saw at the border, I mean, there's still actually Rob Dew, I
[01:11:28.523 --> 01:11:31.582]  know, is working on editing some other reports right now.
[01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:34.163]  So we still have more content and more footage.
[01:11:34.163 --> 01:11:36.923]  But Alex, this is something I'm starting to notice.
[01:11:36.923 --> 01:11:40.863]   This happens at the Texas Capitol a couple weeks ago when I was down there confronting
[01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:46.723]   the trans kids, protesters or ralliers, however you want to derange people, in my eyes.
[01:11:47.237 --> 01:11:52.781]  And then it happened again at the border where all I'm doing is clearly standing up for what's right.
[01:11:52.981 --> 01:11:53.821]  And everybody knows it.
[01:11:53.961 --> 01:11:56.682]  Everybody knows that's an illegal immigrant invasion going on.
[01:11:56.702 --> 01:11:59.704]  Everybody knows the government is running it, and UNICEF, and everybody.
[01:11:59.904 --> 01:12:01.404]  It's clearly an attack on our country.
[01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:05.546]  Just like these trans kids activists, this is clearly an attack on children.
[01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:13.008]  It's ridiculous to suggest that a minor should be able to consent to that type of body-altering surgery.
[01:12:13.048 --> 01:12:15.389]  It's just absolutely ludicrous that all this is going on.
[01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:21.732]  And so whether I'm at the Capitol calling it out, or I'm at the southern border calling it out, I'm starting to notice the same thing.
[01:12:22.512 --> 01:12:33.077]  People that are there observing me, and they're cheering it on, and they're pumping their fists, and they're clapping their hands, and they're like, yeah, go get them, because it's like, oh, somebody's standing up to the bullies!
[01:12:33.358 --> 01:12:35.218]  Somebody's standing up to the deranged lunatics!
[01:12:35.259 --> 01:12:36.959]  Somebody's finally standing up to these people!
[01:12:36.999 --> 01:12:37.480]  Thank God!
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:42.804]  And it's an odd thing because it's like, okay, I mean, yeah, I got the cameras on me and that's part of my thing.
[01:12:43.505 --> 01:12:46.448]  But, you know, you can do this too, right?
[01:12:47.109 --> 01:12:48.950]  It's not just an Owen Schroer thing.
[01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:55.337]  It's not like I'm some freak athlete, LeBron James, that can be great at NBA basketball because I'm a freak athlete.
[01:12:56.218 --> 01:12:57.999]  I'm an American just like everybody else.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.901]  Anybody can do this.
[01:13:00.742 --> 01:13:01.603]  And so it's this weird thing.
[01:13:01.623 --> 01:13:03.244]  It's not like the border is Mars.
[01:13:03.264 --> 01:13:06.187]  It's not like the border is Mars and nobody can go there.
[01:13:06.788 --> 01:13:11.653]  Everybody can go down there that has a Twitter or Facebook or Instagram account or a Rumble account and can show this.
[01:13:11.773 --> 01:13:15.176]  I mean, we don't have the money to stay down there all the time.
[01:13:15.576 --> 01:13:19.380]  We need other people to decide to go down and see this for yourself, folks.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.023]  You've got to see it because this affects everybody right now.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:30.048]  And if you don't want to go down there and film it, you can go down there and talk to him and be like, hey, you know you're facilitating a border invasion here, right?
[01:13:30.088 --> 01:13:34.133]  You know this is an economic bomb set to go off on this country.
[01:13:34.173 --> 01:13:39.760]  You know this is a cultural voting black demographic bomb that the Democrats are about to release into this country.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:40.520]  And by the way...
[01:13:41.121 --> 01:13:53.242]  Getting back to that Biden speech, you know, Mayorkas also said that the biggest threat to this country was white supremacy as he opens the borders to terrorists and rapists and drug dealers and human traffickers and everything else.
[01:13:54.801 --> 01:14:06.951]  So what happens, Alex, with all of these phones that these illegal immigrants are given that have government apps on them and just get the normal push notifications, and now all of a sudden they're getting on their phone.
[01:14:07.252 --> 01:14:09.774]  Oh, President Biden says white supremacy is a big problem.
[01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:13.557]  Oh, Alejandro Mayorkas says white supremacy is a big problem.
[01:14:13.577 --> 01:14:16.480]  And these are the good Democrats that brought me here and gave me all this free stuff.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.802]  And boy, now they've got the boogeyman, the straw man out there.
[01:14:20.783 --> 01:14:26.926]  Nasty Republican white supremacist that hates their guts so much, and they just get that propaganda pushed right to their phone.
[01:14:27.586 --> 01:14:33.209]  I can't believe, I can't believe that they are, that they're going to get away with this, but they are.
[01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:34.349]  People buy into it, Alex.
[01:14:34.389 --> 01:14:38.011]  You saw some of the leftists that were out there at the border trying to have debates with me.
[01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:38.811]  They're into it.
[01:14:38.871 --> 01:14:39.711]  They're totally into it.
[01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:41.332]  They're into collapsing the country.
[01:14:41.652 --> 01:14:42.853]  They're into collapsing the border.
[01:14:43.533 --> 01:14:44.914]  They're self-hating white people.
[01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:47.576]  They're white liberals that hate their own skin color.
[01:14:47.896 --> 01:14:52.058]  And they tell you, if you're any other skin color but white, then you should love yourself and everything you do is great.
[01:14:52.098 --> 01:14:53.880]  But white people are the bad ones.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.544]  But meanwhile, all the people that are non-white want to come into our country and get all our free stuff because we have so much access and excess.
[01:15:01.124 --> 01:15:02.945]  So try to make it make sense, Alex.
[01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:04.485]  No, it's an attack on the country.
[01:15:04.545 --> 01:15:05.545]  There's no other way to put it.
[01:15:05.906 --> 01:15:09.227]  Title 42, Title 8, Title 69, Title 420.
[01:15:09.507 --> 01:15:10.627]  It doesn't matter.
[01:15:10.747 --> 01:15:12.228]  It's an attack against the country.
[01:15:12.468 --> 01:15:14.588]  The illegal immigration pipeline has not stopped.
[01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:21.751]  Even if deportations or apprehensions at the border go up or go down, the numbers are still ludicrous.
[01:15:21.971 --> 01:15:24.432]  We're talking 6 million since Biden has gotten in office.
[01:15:24.612 --> 01:15:27.413]  We're talking at least 40 million probably in the country illegally.
[01:15:27.813 --> 01:15:27.953]  So...
[01:15:29.096 --> 01:15:30.557]  When are we going to properly address this?
[01:15:30.697 --> 01:15:33.039]  I don't know, but the IRS is coming for you, Alex!
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:33.880]  Yeah!
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:46.270]  The IRS is going to hire 87,000 agents, and they're going to fine that American taxpayer that works at a bar off tips, works as a waitress off tips, and uses their Venmo to get paid.
[01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:53.996]  They're going to fine you, and they're going to ring you through until they can get all that cash and all that cut, so they can give it to the illegal immigrants at the southern border.
[01:15:54.256 --> 01:15:56.758]  Or maybe they'll give it to Zelensky in Ukraine, Alex.
[01:15:56.798 --> 01:15:58.300]  Maybe that'll be the one we should give it to.
[01:16:00.145 --> 01:16:01.688]  Well that's exactly what's going on.
[01:16:01.748 --> 01:16:02.390]  Big picture.
[01:16:03.432 --> 01:16:08.121]  What do you think of Elon Musk and this WEF Global Coordinator he just hired?
[01:16:09.642 --> 01:16:12.384]  Well, on the surface, it looks bad, obviously.
[01:16:12.564 --> 01:16:17.367]  I guess I'm willing to give her some time to give her a chance to see how it actually ends up.
[01:16:17.427 --> 01:16:28.715]  But sadly, I think this is exactly what I did a segment about a month ago, how a lot of people are feeling really good about themselves and really uppity right now because they got their Twitter accounts back.
[01:16:29.116 --> 01:16:30.517]  And I was saying, hey, hold on now.
[01:16:31.357 --> 01:16:32.778]  Internet activism is fine.
[01:16:33.238 --> 01:16:47.186]  Being on the internet and telling the truth is a good thing, but let's not think just because you've got your Twitter account temporarily back, that that doesn't mean we have to stop real-world, peaceful, political, First Amendment activism, and that doesn't mean that you're going to have that Twitter account tomorrow.
[01:16:47.706 --> 01:16:52.929]  And so, I think some people are starting to realize, hmm, maybe there is cause for some concern there.
[01:16:53.329 --> 01:16:54.850]  I'm willing to give this lady a chance.
[01:16:55.491 --> 01:16:56.171]  I think we should.
[01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:56.991]  That's fair enough.
[01:16:57.332 --> 01:17:05.902]   I like what Elon Musk has done, but I think there's obvious cause for concern being the World Economic Forum connections that this lady has.
[01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:08.097]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:17:08.137 --> 01:17:18.601]  Meanwhile, we have the giant crime wave with all these major store chains from Walgreens to CVS to Walmart to Whole Foods to Target shutting down.
[01:17:19.141 --> 01:17:20.461]  You're going to be hosting third hour.
[01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:23.162]  I'm going to get the car and drive back from Dallas to Austin.
[01:17:23.182 --> 01:17:25.643]  I'll be back in the studio tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[01:17:25.663 --> 01:17:28.684]  right after Harrison Smith and American Journal, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:17:28.704 --> 01:17:29.244]  to 11 a.m.
[01:17:29.264 --> 01:17:30.764]  But you're going to be hosting the third hour today.
[01:17:30.784 --> 01:17:32.185]  What are you going to be covering then, Owen?
[01:17:32.955 --> 01:17:41.358]  Well, we're going to be taking calls from the audience on all the issues that you covered, and we'll ask them, do they trust Elon Musk to keep Twitter a free speech platform?
[01:17:41.659 --> 01:17:43.879]  Because it's more imperative than we even realize, Alex.
[01:17:43.979 --> 01:17:46.641]  And it's not even about the selfish thing about whether we're on there or not.
[01:17:47.021 --> 01:17:51.763]  You know, Twitter has, the information that's come out on Twitter has changed history.
[01:17:52.243 --> 01:17:55.924]  And if they can control that information, then they can control history, Alex.
[01:17:55.944 --> 01:17:56.365]  That's right.
[01:17:56.445 --> 01:17:59.606]  I'll give the number out before I end this hour, so you're ready to go in the third hour.
[01:18:00.146 --> 01:18:03.531]  All right, we have the editor Peter Brimlow of VDare.com.
[01:18:04.892 --> 01:18:11.962]  He's been a major journalist and commentator and writer at MarketWatch, Forbes, Fortune Magazine, Barron's Financial Post.
[01:18:11.982 --> 01:18:13.063]  It goes on and on.
[01:18:14.203 --> 01:18:22.482]   He heads up VDARE, has been exposing the design collapse of our border, and now we are at
[01:18:22.482 --> 01:18:24.443]  complete failure of our border.
[01:18:24.443 --> 01:18:29.283]   So to give us a 35,000 foot historical view of what's happening and what he thinks is
[01:18:29.283 --> 01:18:31.963]  coming next is our special guest.
[01:18:31.963 --> 01:18:34.562]  So Mr. Brimlow, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:18:34.562 --> 01:18:35.562]  You go anywhere you want.
[01:18:35.562 --> 01:18:37.643]  I know you're an expert on this.
[01:18:37.643 --> 01:18:38.643]  Thanks for joining us today.
[01:18:38.643 --> 01:18:41.082]  It's a great honor.
[01:18:41.135 --> 01:18:41.936]  Thank you very much.
[01:18:43.558 --> 01:18:47.783]  What's happening is the government has decided to dissolve the people and elect a new one.
[01:18:48.283 --> 01:18:54.250]  It doesn't like the Americans it has, so it's going to import a whole bunch of new voters on a huge scale.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:19:04.584]  There's something like, it's hard to tell, but somewhere between up to 5 million illegals have been released into the US since Biden took over.
[01:19:04.604 --> 01:19:18.650]  A million and a half of them have just crossed without any contact with the government at all because they know that if they were caught they'd prove to be terrorists or convicted felons or something like that.
[01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:20.671]  So the border's collapsed basically.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.642]  And it's something that the Democrats want.
[01:19:25.662 --> 01:19:27.362]  They want to elect some new people here.
[01:19:29.343 --> 01:19:31.684]  Well, you've worked in the corporate media at the highest levels.
[01:19:31.884 --> 01:19:35.465]  What got you into VDARE and foreseeing what was coming?
[01:19:35.946 --> 01:19:37.066]  And what's the time frame?
[01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:39.127]  What's the globalist replacement migration model?
[01:19:39.627 --> 01:19:40.847]  Is there time to turn it back?
[01:19:40.928 --> 01:19:42.068]  How is this being received?
[01:19:42.088 --> 01:19:47.030]  I mean, it does seem like it's waking people up right now, but is it a dollar a day late, a dollar short?
[01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:49.876]  No, there's a lot of stuff that could be done.
[01:19:49.896 --> 01:19:54.117]  I think the most critical thing that could be done right now is abolishing birthright citizenship.
[01:19:54.698 --> 01:19:57.218]  Because all of these people who are going to come in are coming in now.
[01:19:57.978 --> 01:20:00.059]  If they have kids here, those kids are American citizens.
[01:20:00.459 --> 01:20:03.160]  As a practical matter, they can't be deported.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.500]  So that should be done immediately.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.081]  And then, of course, they should do massive deportations.
[01:20:10.362 --> 01:20:15.863]  There was a huge deportation campaign in the early 50s when there was an illegal immigration crisis.
[01:20:17.043 --> 01:20:20.504]  It wasn't nowhere near as bad as this, but it was very substantial.
[01:20:21.004 --> 01:20:23.785]  And about a million and a half illegals left in the 1950s.
[01:20:24.045 --> 01:20:26.245]  They only had to deport about 100,000 of them.
[01:20:26.986 --> 01:20:28.486]  The others got the message and left.
[01:20:28.546 --> 01:20:29.386]  And that would happen again.
[01:20:29.846 --> 01:20:34.407]  The problem is the Democrats don't want it to happen.
[01:20:34.427 --> 01:20:40.669]  We've got to end anchor babies, end anchor babies, and then re-implement President Eisenhower's policies.
[01:20:42.392 --> 01:20:43.192]  Right, that's right.
[01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:46.374]  They argue everything is just an accident, it should never have happened.
[01:20:46.674 --> 01:20:50.115]  And it's been abolished in most common law jurisdictions for exactly this reason.
[01:20:50.775 --> 01:20:55.777]  Of course it will mean that there'll be a population in the country that can't vote, that's not of the not citizens and can't vote.
[01:20:55.978 --> 01:20:59.519]  But that's just too bad, this is the way we result, this has got to be solved.
[01:21:01.048 --> 01:21:02.670]  I'll answer all the questions Alex.
[01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:03.371]  I've got an interest in this.
[01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:07.255]  Obviously, I'm an immigrant myself, although more than 40 years ago.
[01:21:08.416 --> 01:21:11.699]  I guess I'm doing a dirty job that Americans won't do.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:27.860]   As with National Review in the early 90s, When I was with Forbes also, and I wrote a cover story saying time to rethink immigration, which became a book that was published in 95, Alien Nation, which did very well.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.521]  And there was a flurry of interest in it.
[01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:35.923]  And then, you know, the establishment cracked down and Bill Buckley fired all immigration reformers from National Review.
[01:21:36.544 --> 01:21:38.745]  And we had to go to the internet.
[01:21:38.865 --> 01:21:42.286]  And it took nearly another 20 years to get the debate going again.
[01:21:45.027 --> 01:21:47.749]  You're a leading expert on this.
[01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:48.390]  Let me ask you this.
[01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:49.911]  What's the timetable?
[01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:52.312]  How long until we lose the country?
[01:21:52.332 --> 01:21:54.914]  I mean, how bad is it?
[01:21:55.014 --> 01:21:59.177]  Give us your real prognosis on what's going to happen if this continues.
[01:22:00.158 --> 01:22:07.423]  Put in very blunt terms, White's will cease to be a majority in America somewhere around about 2050.
[01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:12.306]  Now, that doesn't mean there'll be a majority, that she's being a majority of the electorate.
[01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:13.848]  That'll take maybe another 20 years.
[01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:21.984]  Well, somewhere in here, you know, if you want America to remain American, you've got to get control of the situation.
[01:22:22.424 --> 01:22:29.406]  And that means an immigration moratorium, it means mass deportation, it probably means retroactive birthright citizenship reform.
[01:22:29.827 --> 01:22:37.589]  All the people who came in in the last three or four years should not be allowed to become American citizens and their children should be allowed to become American citizens.
[01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:38.730]  But it can be done.
[01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.791]  You know, people forget that emigration is as well as immigration.
[01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:50.305]   There are several places in the world where you see Alien populations diminish for various reasons.
[01:22:51.846 --> 01:22:54.608]  One, for example, is Quebec.
[01:22:54.648 --> 01:23:01.691]  The number of Anglophones, English speakers in Quebec, has collapsed since the Nationalist Government of Scotland controlled the province.
[01:23:02.172 --> 01:23:04.413]  People can just be encouraged to leave.
[01:23:07.707 --> 01:23:15.369]  In Quebec they have a Francophile, pro-French policy that push out anybody that spoke English.
[01:23:15.889 --> 01:23:19.851]  Whether you're for that policy or not, it shows the incredible power of government policy.
[01:23:19.971 --> 01:23:28.553]  And again, we could say if we brought in all these new people and taught them about freedom, they'd be fine, but they're being taught to be leftist, they're being taught by the left to hate white people.
[01:23:29.153 --> 01:23:32.155]  And we see the left literally pushing racial politics.
[01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:36.457]  So you can't bring in a bunch of people that are anti-white or are going to be anti-white.
[01:23:36.757 --> 01:23:38.038]  We're not the ones making it racial.
[01:23:38.438 --> 01:23:41.340]  The left is making it racial because they can see the world's majority brown.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.222]  If they can bring in all these people and make it racial, they win.
[01:23:45.905 --> 01:23:50.567]  This is completely different to what happened during the last great wave of immigration, you know, 1880 to 1920.
[01:23:50.887 --> 01:24:01.973]  There were really powerful assimilative mechanisms there and people, for example, kids weren't allowed to speak foreign languages in the classrooms and that kind of thing.
[01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:11.297]  Now, of course, they're encouraged to speak foreign language in the classroom and encouraged to be taught in foreign languages because the people who are on the country don't like it and they want to transform it.
[01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:16.132]  The other weird thing that's happening, though, is that... Well, you just said it.
[01:24:16.172 --> 01:24:22.535]  If we want people to assimilate the melting pot, we could do it, but they're bringing in foreign populations to, what, create balkanization?
[01:24:24.896 --> 01:24:25.297]  Oh, yes.
[01:24:25.357 --> 01:24:29.078]  I mean, the Democrats have bet everything on identity politics.
[01:24:29.198 --> 01:24:33.961]  They think if they have, you know, various ethnic factions and so on, they're easily manipulated.
[01:24:34.021 --> 01:24:38.483]  And they're also easily incited against the host American population.
[01:24:39.385 --> 01:24:46.890]  Which is why we see Joe Biden giving this speech at Howard University on the weekend saying that the major problem is white supremacy.
[01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:48.991]  You know, that's the major problem in the country.
[01:24:49.011 --> 01:24:51.853]  Of course, the major problem in this country is black crime.
[01:24:52.173 --> 01:24:53.654]  But he doesn't want to say that.
[01:24:53.694 --> 01:24:57.216]  He wants to rile up his own base.
[01:24:58.437 --> 01:25:03.900]  The next thing is going to be reparations for Hispanics or something like that because of Cortez.
[01:25:04.861 --> 01:25:08.043]  They're full of all kinds of ingenious ideas to bite people off.
[01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:13.822]  Well, I was about to say, it's literally about control.
[01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:17.164]  Like you said, it's the broken coalition strategy.
[01:25:17.184 --> 01:25:22.246]  We've got a bunch of isolated groups fighting with each other, and then this ruling class rules over us.
[01:25:23.686 --> 01:25:27.428]  We have a writer, Steve Sale, calls it the coalition of the fringes.
[01:25:27.915 --> 01:25:35.479]  They have a whole bunch of sort of not typical Americans that are in alliance with each other, who actually don't like each other very much.
[01:25:35.499 --> 01:25:40.442]  I mean, if you look at the reports from California, Hispanics and blacks are constantly fighting each other.
[01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.543]  But the Democrats don't want to know about that.
[01:25:43.584 --> 01:25:45.485]  So what they do is they incite them against whites.
[01:25:45.525 --> 01:25:46.725]  And that's what Biden is doing.
[01:25:47.005 --> 01:25:49.547]  He's telling people that black Americans are evil.
[01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:52.368]  And they need to be replaced.
[01:25:52.508 --> 01:25:53.289]  They need to be outvoted.
[01:25:54.471 --> 01:25:56.555]  So what is the policy?
[01:25:56.595 --> 01:25:59.921]  What is the idea, Peter, to end this, to stop this?
[01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:00.682]  What do we need to do?
[01:26:04.232 --> 01:26:06.754]  First of all, abolish positive correctness.
[01:26:06.774 --> 01:26:08.696]  Why can't we talk about this frankly?
[01:26:09.576 --> 01:26:13.259]  Because we can't in the mainstream media, which is why you and I are talking here now.
[01:26:15.281 --> 01:26:18.804]  But in the short run what we need is one, immigration moratorium.
[01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:21.506]  Two, massive deportation.
[01:26:22.086 --> 01:26:23.808]  Three, birthright citizenship reform.
[01:26:24.168 --> 01:26:29.632]   Four, I think the abolition of a lot of these Isn't it a gamble by the big corporations on the left to make politics racial?
[01:26:29.471 --> 01:26:37.471]   which is basically a way of subsidizing these non-white, non-traditional groups through public policy.
[01:26:37.471 --> 01:26:43.471]   That's necessary because if they were subsidized, they would go away, they would be more inclined to go away.
[01:26:43.471 --> 01:26:49.471]   Isn't it a gamble by the big corporations on the left to make politics racial?
[01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:54.471]   I mean, it seems like a very dangerous gamble, but I guess it's an easy way to control people.
[01:26:54.471 --> 01:27:00.951]   It's simply extraordinary to me that they're doing this, that big corporations are doing this, because it's
[01:27:00.951 --> 01:27:02.471]  obviously going to strengthen the hand on the left.
[01:27:03.297 --> 01:27:19.607]  Now to a large extent, a lot of these corporations obviously think they can do deals with left-wing governments, and that really what they do, they're really oligopolies and they have alliances with the government and they don't have to face market forces and so on, so they think they can do a deal with this.
[01:27:19.806 --> 01:27:22.606]  But on the other hand, it is going to cause instability.
[01:27:22.606 --> 01:27:39.806]  That's what really brought us to this point.
[01:27:39.739 --> 01:27:45.182]  What are the corporations thinking trying to export the third world here and then not integrate them?
[01:27:45.582 --> 01:27:50.364]  Because if they tried hard, we probably could integrate these people, but they're doing the opposite for cultural warfare.
[01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:51.945]  Why are they doing that?
[01:27:51.965 --> 01:27:52.986]  You got interrupted by the break.
[01:27:53.206 --> 01:27:54.626]  Please go back and elaborate on that.
[01:27:55.767 --> 01:28:01.890]  Well, you know, obviously the most, the most, the clearest motive is just an absolute blind addiction to cheap labor.
[01:28:02.586 --> 01:28:10.868]  Because it's not really cheap because what happens is these people come in and they use the emergency rooms and the children are educated public expense and all that kind of thing.
[01:28:11.288 --> 01:28:17.950]  So what these corporations are able to do really is to privatize the pockets and socialize the costs and they think that's a very good thing.
[01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:27.353]  But you know this is what happened in the 1900s when immigration was cut off for the first great wave is eventually it starts to be social chaos.
[01:28:27.933 --> 01:28:31.734]  Anarchists and so on blowing people up and all that kind of thing and that really frightened business.
[01:28:32.213 --> 01:28:35.435]  Somewhere about the 1920s, they decided to cut immigration off.
[01:28:35.755 --> 01:28:38.838]  And it was cut off for more than 40 years completely.
[01:28:39.198 --> 01:28:42.640]  And I think there's quite a lack that's going to happen again at some point.
[01:28:43.421 --> 01:28:46.363]  They're going to get friend by the chaos that this is bringing.
[01:28:48.944 --> 01:28:56.089]  And again, for those that say we can't close the border, all the evidence shows Trump got it shut down 90 plus percent.
[01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:58.451]  It was Biden saying surge the border.
[01:28:58.471 --> 01:28:59.912]  It was Obama saying surge the border.
[01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:01.233]  They precipitated this.
[01:29:02.418 --> 01:29:03.539]  Sure, they invited it.
[01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:04.700]  They wanted it to happen.
[01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:11.545]  One of the points about assimilation that you've got to remember is it really is a function of numbers.
[01:29:11.925 --> 01:29:20.252]  The great pause that we had in the middle of the 20th century actually allowed assimilation to take place because the ethnic enclave were being constantly reinforced.
[01:29:20.872 --> 01:29:22.053]  Numbers are just too large here.
[01:29:22.313 --> 01:29:30.800]  It's going to take a long, long time to digest the wave that's come in, not just illegal but also legal, since the borders were opened up in 1965.
[01:29:33.588 --> 01:29:38.831]  It'll take 50 years to assimilate this, you know.
[01:29:38.951 --> 01:29:44.095]  Another point I've got to remember is about the current flow is that, you know, we didn't have a welfare state in the 1900s.
[01:29:45.293 --> 01:29:47.855]  So if people failed in the workforce, they would just go back home.
[01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.497]  And they did in enormous numbers.
[01:29:49.557 --> 01:29:54.701]  Something like two-thirds of all Italian immigrants ultimately went back to Italy in the early 1900s.
[01:29:54.781 --> 01:29:56.142]  That doesn't happen now.
[01:29:56.483 --> 01:30:01.987]  If you fail in the workforce, you can stay here on welfare and various other forms of grants.
[01:30:02.308 --> 01:30:08.833]  So the whole dynamic of immigration, it's self-correcting aspects that used to exist, no longer exist.
[01:30:09.354 --> 01:30:10.795]  And it's something that's got to be addressed.
[01:30:12.321 --> 01:30:17.823]  That's right, you can't have an open border with a welfare state, plus people getting here being brainwashed in leftist ideology.
[01:30:17.863 --> 01:30:24.045]  I noticed the NGOs that are now in control of border policy were the same ones that ran the invasion of Europe and it's the exact same policy.
[01:30:24.065 --> 01:30:34.429]  I've seen numbers of 85-90% of people a decade later from the Middle East and other areas brought into Europe by the very same NGOs still don't have jobs, they're still on welfare.
[01:30:34.809 --> 01:30:39.391]   What do giant permanent ghettos Giant permanent no-go zones do.
[01:30:39.751 --> 01:30:41.252]  These huge no-go zones do.
[01:30:41.912 --> 01:30:43.032]  What does that do for the establishment?
[01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:49.075]  The NGOs, of course, are enormously self-interested in this.
[01:30:49.175 --> 01:30:55.797]  All these so-called religious charities actually get paid to bring these people in and dump them on the local welfare system.
[01:30:56.738 --> 01:31:00.119]  These guys who run these things are an enormous amount of money.
[01:31:01.431 --> 01:31:03.813]  So it's fundamentally a corrupt motive.
[01:31:04.053 --> 01:31:05.274]  But it's not just corruption.
[01:31:05.614 --> 01:31:11.118]  These people absolutely dislike having a white America.
[01:31:11.158 --> 01:31:20.424]  They think they're safer for various ethnic reasons if they can build a more diverse America and they can manipulate all the different factions and play them up against each other.
[01:31:20.844 --> 01:31:22.205]  And that's of course what they're doing.
[01:31:23.033 --> 01:31:28.440]  By the way, I have the clips of leftists like the head of the vaccine program in Texas saying he's a white lady.
[01:31:29.001 --> 01:31:30.142]  White people are inherently bad.
[01:31:30.162 --> 01:31:30.883]  We've got to get rid of them.
[01:31:30.903 --> 01:31:31.664]  They don't do what we say.
[01:31:31.684 --> 01:31:45.998]   So I think there is a idea that the rebellions of England the last 400 years and Scotland and Ireland I mean, if you really look at the Civil War and what happened there, I mean, it was a bunch of people from what's the UK today that did want to be told what to do.
[01:31:46.478 --> 01:31:53.003]  And I think they do see particularly that European stock is having a seed of rebellion in it that they don't want.
[01:31:53.023 --> 01:31:54.645]  The globalists have captured the third world.
[01:31:54.965 --> 01:31:56.906]  So they're really fundamentally attacking that.
[01:31:56.966 --> 01:31:57.767]  I mean, it really is true.
[01:31:59.408 --> 01:32:02.871]  Yeah, we're moving towards a Latin Americanization of the US.
[01:32:03.513 --> 01:32:10.257]  Where you have a small number of very wealthy people and a very large number of very poor people.
[01:32:10.718 --> 01:32:15.361]  And it's actually surprising when you look at Latin America, how they differ.
[01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:17.722]  The masses differ to the elite.
[01:32:18.162 --> 01:32:24.887]  Even when you look at the advertisements, you see that the advertisements are all white models, which you never see in the US anymore.
[01:32:26.027 --> 01:32:31.516]   For some reason, they're able to keep their So the time we have left, what are solutions?
[01:32:31.377 --> 01:32:34.736]  control than what happens here.
[01:32:34.736 --> 01:32:39.856]  And maybe that's what they're trying to bring in.
[01:32:39.856 --> 01:32:41.976]  So the time we have left, what are solutions?
[01:32:41.976 --> 01:32:46.856]   I mean, I've been following V-Dare for decades, but you guys have been ahead of the curve.
[01:32:46.856 --> 01:32:48.856]  But what are the solutions to this?
[01:32:48.856 --> 01:32:53.056]  You know, but this guy needs a good election.
[01:32:53.056 --> 01:32:54.297]  These things can be turned around.
[01:32:54.297 --> 01:32:59.657]  You know, that's why the left was so terrified by Trump.
[01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:04.136]   When he was elected in 2016, the Republicans controlled the House and the Senate and the
[01:33:04.136 --> 01:33:04.977]  executive branch.
[01:33:05.372 --> 01:33:06.492]  So they could have done all this.
[01:33:06.512 --> 01:33:07.573]  They could have had a moratorium.
[01:33:07.593 --> 01:33:11.255]  They could have had a moratorium for 50 years.
[01:33:12.015 --> 01:33:14.336]  They could have passed birthright citizenship reform and all that kind of thing.
[01:33:14.536 --> 01:33:22.900]  They just didn't do it because the people who run the Republican Party read the Wall Street Journal editorial page and are basically boneheaded corporatists.
[01:33:23.421 --> 01:33:26.442]  But the Left knows it could be done and that's why they're so terrified.
[01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:30.530]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:35.012]  What do you think they're going to do with Trump this election cycle?
[01:33:35.052 --> 01:33:36.052]  They haven't done anything.
[01:33:36.072 --> 01:33:39.874]  They're trying to put him in jail, but he's like 30 points ahead of the Republican.
[01:33:40.955 --> 01:33:42.415]  They absolutely intend to put him in jail.
[01:33:42.776 --> 01:33:46.497]  That's not simply because they think it's the only way they can keep him out of politics.
[01:33:46.837 --> 01:33:48.298]  It's because they're very emotional people.
[01:33:48.338 --> 01:33:49.499]  They love and hate him.
[01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:51.660]  He's really upset them.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.000]  That's about all you can say about Trump.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.041]  He has all the right elements.
[01:33:56.119 --> 01:33:57.260]  No, I don't think that'll work.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.361]  I think he stands an excellent chance of being elected.
[01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:04.724]  I don't, you know, DeSantis has said some good stuff about immigration, but he doesn't say it very loud.
[01:34:04.784 --> 01:34:08.947]  In some ways, he's actually better than Trump on legal immigration, but he doesn't say it very loudly.
[01:34:09.287 --> 01:34:14.550]  And I think his donors won't let him say it, which means that he'll lose, of course.
[01:34:18.473 --> 01:34:23.075]  Well, I've asked a lot of questions here, and I've got more questions, Peter Bremlow, from veter.com.
[01:34:23.095 --> 01:34:25.437]  But any other points you'd like to make in the last few minutes we have left?
[01:34:27.321 --> 01:34:33.463]  Well, I urge everybody to go to vDare.com and we have a wide range of articles there.
[01:34:34.904 --> 01:34:38.705]  We calculate what the impact on wage rates is on immigration in flow.
[01:34:39.325 --> 01:34:41.846]  And we also do a lot of stuff on white and black crime.
[01:34:42.446 --> 01:34:43.367]  It doesn't get reported.
[01:34:43.547 --> 01:34:45.328]  Essentially what we do is we report stuff.
[01:34:45.468 --> 01:34:46.289]  I have a rule of thumb.
[01:34:46.329 --> 01:34:49.571]  I was involved with National Review for a long time.
[01:34:49.911 --> 01:34:53.314]  If it's something that they would not publish, we will publish it.
[01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:57.356]  We're the professional, anti-politic correctness side.
[01:34:58.998 --> 01:35:02.940]  Was National Review always CIA controlled?
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.082]  Or what do you think William F. Buckley was really up to?
[01:35:06.736 --> 01:35:19.082]  You know, I thought about that a lot, Alex, because he was in the CIA, and the kind of thing that the CIA did was they did sponsor magazines like Encounter and so on, which were sort of moderate right-wing magazines.
[01:35:21.514 --> 01:35:24.916]  I don't know that Bucky was ever any good.
[01:35:25.316 --> 01:35:27.878]  But they were useful.
[01:35:28.258 --> 01:35:31.700]  You know, the Comedic Conservative Movement's great achievement was winning the Cold War.
[01:35:32.541 --> 01:35:34.702]  But after it won the Cold War, it just went to pieces.
[01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:39.745]  And my own view is because they would not identify as a nationalist, patriot movement.
[01:35:40.245 --> 01:35:42.327]  And above all, it wouldn't get involved in the immigration issue.
[01:35:42.347 --> 01:35:43.207]  I mean, I tried.
[01:35:43.687 --> 01:35:46.609]  I tried to do it, but Bucky didn't want to listen.
[01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:55.692]   And although he was initially in favour of it, I think his donors and his Republican friends told him that they want cheap rail and they don't want to raise this issue.
[01:35:58.253 --> 01:35:59.573]  Well this is the big issue.
[01:35:59.593 --> 01:36:15.357]  The UN is using replacement migration as a weapon and the ADL says if you talk about it you should go to jail when it's a real UN policy and it's happening now and they're exploiting the people they're bringing in, they're exploiting us, they're creating division to have a balkanized divide in Congress strategy.
[01:36:19.392 --> 01:36:20.834]  You see it in every Western country.
[01:36:20.874 --> 01:36:22.956]  What's happened to Ireland is simply staggering.
[01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:26.100]  And there they're passing law to make it illegal to criticise it.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.322]  They don't have a First Amendment.
[01:36:29.384 --> 01:36:29.744]  That's right.
[01:36:29.805 --> 01:36:34.891]  It's an actual playbook of leftist governments to capture their countries to bring in permanent underclasses they control.
[01:36:35.171 --> 01:36:36.573]  Peter Brimlow, thank you so much for the time.
[01:36:37.654 --> 01:36:38.335]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:36:39.699 --> 01:36:42.780]  All right, I'm going to get in the car and drive back from Dallas to Austin.
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:45.101]  I'll be at the office later working until late tonight.
[01:36:45.161 --> 01:36:46.181]  I'll be back at 11 a.m.
[01:36:46.201 --> 01:36:47.322]  Central with the regular show.
[01:36:47.742 --> 01:36:49.282]  Owen Schroyer knocks it out of the park.
[01:36:49.342 --> 01:36:52.463]  The crew did an A-plus grand slam job at the border.
[01:36:52.483 --> 01:36:55.785]  They've got a bunch of clips that haven't aired yet, a bunch of exclusive stuff coming up next hour.
[01:36:55.805 --> 01:36:57.245]  He's got a ton of news.
[01:36:57.385 --> 01:36:59.466]  And then who is doing the fourth hour?
[01:36:59.506 --> 01:37:01.687]  The great Gerald Cilente.
[01:37:01.807 --> 01:37:04.428]  And then Owen comes back at 3 o'clock.
[01:37:04.448 --> 01:37:05.328]  Hell, I may make it back.
[01:37:06.148 --> 01:37:11.210]  In time to do the last hour with Owen today of The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:12.611]  There's a lot I didn't get to today.
[01:37:13.631 --> 01:37:18.773]  We covered a ton of it on Steven Crowder's show that I was hosting while Steven's out taking care of business.
[01:37:19.653 --> 01:37:20.714]  But it is getting crazy.
[01:37:21.434 --> 01:37:23.334]  Tomorrow is going to be completely jam-packed as well.
[01:37:23.855 --> 01:37:24.375]  Please remember.
[01:37:25.469 --> 01:37:26.609]  We're not funded by the big banks.
[01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:27.390]  We're funded by you.
[01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:30.571]  I thank you for your prayer, your word of mouth, and your financial support.
[01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:31.931]  We have products you really need.
[01:37:32.392 --> 01:37:35.653]  X3, TurboForce, Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:37:36.733 --> 01:37:39.354]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:37:39.394 --> 01:37:41.895]  Get a book and a film, and I thank you for doing that.
[01:37:42.215 --> 01:37:49.620]   We're very close to turning the tide here, for sanity, but it's going to take more Focus, energy to do it, and you are the answer.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:50.521]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[01:37:50.561 --> 01:37:52.143]  Black, white, old, young, doesn't matter.
[01:37:52.443 --> 01:37:55.246]  If you love liberty and freedom and love God, we're on the same team.
[01:37:55.667 --> 01:37:56.888]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:37:56.928 --> 01:37:57.709]  Please go there now.
[01:37:58.049 --> 01:37:59.691]  Owen Schroeder takes over in hour number three.
[01:37:59.530 --> 01:38:15.449]  Please stay with us.
[01:38:15.449 --> 01:38:17.291]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:38:17.848 --> 01:38:19.929]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:21.510]  It will change your life.
[01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:30.814]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:38:30.854 --> 01:38:35.716]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:38:36.196 --> 01:38:41.280]   Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.904]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:38:46.364 --> 01:38:53.151]  And Infowarstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:38:53.451 --> 01:38:59.477]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:39:00.017 --> 01:39:01.878]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:39:02.379 --> 01:39:04.280]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.341]  You and your family need it.
[01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:07.642]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:39:08.183 --> 01:39:12.105]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:14.827]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:39:14.847 --> 01:39:22.833]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the Biden crime family has been and will continue to be exposed.
[01:39:23.593 --> 01:39:26.055]  We have a special report on this at Band.Video.
[01:39:26.515 --> 01:39:28.917]  I'm going to be taking calls the rest of this hour.
[01:39:30.362 --> 01:39:38.975]  What do you think about Twitter now that Elon Musk has put in a World Economic Forum individual as the new CEO?
[01:39:38.815 --> 01:39:42.615]   But first, here's a John Bowne report on the Biden crime family.
[01:39:42.615 --> 01:39:50.215]  [MUSIC]
[01:39:50.215 --> 01:39:55.055]   House Republicans are getting closer to uncovering the full scope of the alleged
[01:39:55.055 --> 01:40:00.014]   Biden crime family treason, and the distractions are becoming more obvious.
[01:40:00.055 --> 01:40:04.058]  For the record, no one gives two shits about George Santos.
[01:40:04.359 --> 01:40:09.404]  I've been accused, all of us have been, over this particular issue that we're conspiracy theorists, we're not.
[01:40:09.864 --> 01:40:16.431]  What we're proving to you today is showing you actual bank records, actual evidence of shell companies and businesses.
[01:40:16.451 --> 01:40:18.934]  There are more businesses and more Bidens involved than we knew of.
[01:40:18.954 --> 01:40:24.300]  You have to issue more subpoenas because every time we turn over a rock, there's more information.
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:25.741]  There's more possible corruption.
[01:40:25.761 --> 01:40:29.245]  There's more possible allegations that need to be investigated.
[01:40:30.166 --> 01:40:41.239]  First instance, while Vice President Biden was lecturing Romania on anti-corruption policies, in reality he was a walking billboard for his son and family to collect money.
[01:40:41.839 --> 01:40:44.062]  Corruption is a cancer.
[01:40:45.123 --> 01:40:49.486]  A cancer that eats away at a citizen's faith in democracy.
[01:40:49.506 --> 01:40:54.550]  And most importantly, it divides, denies the people their dignity.
[01:40:54.570 --> 01:41:07.760]  President Biden and his associates capitalized on a lucrative financial relationship with a Romanian national who was under investigation for, and later convicted of, corruption in Romania.
[01:41:09.116 --> 01:41:23.249]  The Bidens received over $1 million for the deal, and 16 of the 17 payments to their associates' account that funneled the Bidens' money occurred while Joe Biden was vice president.
[01:41:23.469 --> 01:41:30.215]  In fact, the money stops flowing from the Romanian national soon after Joe Biden leaves the vice presidency.
[01:41:30.675 --> 01:41:42.524]  Walker's limited liability company Robinson Walker LLC paid Hunter, James, Hallie, and others in the Biden network more than $2 million after foreign money hit his account.
[01:41:42.784 --> 01:41:52.972]  This included payments to James Biden, who received five wires and over $50,000, who did no discernible work to earn that money.
[01:41:53.432 --> 01:41:57.936]  There is no business structure around this family, except politics.
[01:41:59.133 --> 01:42:15.577]  And since Joe Biden has spent decades in the Senate, served eight years as Vice President, and is now President of the United States, and the family's getting money from various countries and foreign businesses through various shell companies and this web of LLCs.
[01:42:16.218 --> 01:42:18.998]  I mean, guys, you in the press, this is easy pickings.
[01:42:19.038 --> 01:42:21.059]  I'm giving you Pulitzer stuff here.
[01:42:21.079 --> 01:42:24.360]  16 companies created while he was Vice President.
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:30.282]  Now the list is 20, and as we continue our investigation, that list is growing.
[01:42:30.842 --> 01:42:44.205]  You have Rosemont Seneca Partners, Rosemont Seneca Advisors, Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners, RSP Holdings, RSTP2 Alpha, RSTP2 Bravo.
[01:42:44.566 --> 01:42:54.144]   You are concealing money from either the IRS, Or from credit agencies, or from other people in general.
[01:42:54.384 --> 01:42:56.644]  That's the only reason you set up a structure like this.
[01:42:57.285 --> 01:43:05.468]  Following the House Oversight Committee's press conference, there were crickets from the CIA's news networks NBC and ABC.
[01:43:05.668 --> 01:43:18.713]  To their credit, CBS attempted to put the allegations to bed, attempting to mutate the conspiracy theory PSYOP in the face of bank documents and whistleblower testimony into a nothing burger.
[01:43:19.173 --> 01:43:20.735]  What law was broken, you wonder?
[01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:24.695]   What has been the White House's response to all of this being investigated?
[01:43:24.695 --> 01:43:30.695]   Sound at band.video. Marjorie Taylor Greene is teasing that new information on the Bidens will be coming out this week.
[01:43:30.695 --> 01:43:35.695]  Alright, I'm hosting this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:35.695 --> 01:43:42.695]   I am going to be doing news coverage for three hours on The War Room, all the latest breaking news.
[01:43:42.695 --> 01:43:46.695]  But for this hour, I'm going to be taking phone calls.
[01:43:47.510 --> 01:44:01.215]  I'd like to specifically get your thoughts on Elon Musk hiring Linda Yassarino, who is very closely affiliated to the World Economic Forum.
[01:44:02.678 --> 01:44:04.599]  And now she's going to be the CEO of Twitter.
[01:44:04.659 --> 01:44:06.019]  How does that make you feel?
[01:44:06.559 --> 01:44:08.000]  I'll explain why this is important.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.120]  Again, taking your calls on that.
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:10.540]  The number 877-789-2539.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:10.660]  877-789-2539.
[01:44:10.681 --> 01:44:14.302]  I know a lot of people still want to talk about the border coverage from this weekend.
[01:44:14.141 --> 01:44:20.101]   I know a lot of people still want to talk about the border coverage from this weekend,
[01:44:20.101 --> 01:44:23.341]  so if you can get through on that too, that's fine.
[01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:29.942]   Now before we do that, everything we do here is brought to you by you shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:29.959 --> 01:44:32.525]  We've got great supplements and products for you there.
[01:44:33.678 --> 01:44:40.942]  Like Survival Shield X3, a lot of people are learning about the Iodine Deficiency Conspiracy.
[01:44:41.823 --> 01:44:44.204]  And this has been done intentionally to you.
[01:44:44.544 --> 01:44:50.307]  That's why they put the neurotoxic fluoride in your drinking water, in your tap water.
[01:44:51.108 --> 01:44:52.829]  And so really it's a... it's a...
[01:44:53.849 --> 01:45:00.936]  Two-part solution, not just the nascent iodine, the Survival Shield X3 nascent iodine, that is on sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:00.976 --> 01:45:02.497]  It's also filtering your water.
[01:45:03.198 --> 01:45:05.340]  And so we have water filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.422]  And I love when people respond to this.
[01:45:07.702 --> 01:45:09.064]  It's always liberals, it's always lefties.
[01:45:10.105 --> 01:45:16.691]  It's like, oh, Jones and InfoWars tell you that there's fluoride in the water and then they sell you a water filter.
[01:45:17.532 --> 01:45:18.693]  Uh, yeah.
[01:45:19.614 --> 01:45:20.054]  Wow.
[01:45:20.735 --> 01:45:21.895]  Like, oh my gosh.
[01:45:22.636 --> 01:45:23.336]  No kidding.
[01:45:24.957 --> 01:45:25.457]  Duh!
[01:45:26.318 --> 01:45:30.220]  Yeah, we found out there's stuff in the water we don't want to drink, so we like to filter our water.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.001]  We might think that you would too.
[01:45:33.161 --> 01:45:37.944]  But that's not, oh my gosh, they tell you that there's fluoride in the tap water, then they sell you the filter to get it out.
[01:45:39.324 --> 01:45:39.765]  Yeah.
[01:45:40.645 --> 01:45:42.726]  We're not the ones that put the fluoride in the water.
[01:45:42.766 --> 01:45:45.928]  Like, if we put it in the water, then maybe you'd have a case there.
[01:45:45.968 --> 01:45:47.028]  That's not us putting it in there.
[01:45:47.429 --> 01:45:53.668]   So, Jokes aside, if you don't have a water filter in your home now, what are you waiting for?
[01:45:53.728 --> 01:45:57.710]  Why are you, as an InfoWars listener, not filtering your water?
[01:45:58.690 --> 01:46:09.895]  And let's not forget about the important iodine, Survival Shield X3, and it's your support there that makes everything we do possible, just like our border coverage this weekend.
[01:46:10.016 --> 01:46:13.717]  InfoWarsTore.com, Survival Shield X3, and the water filters.
[01:46:14.638 --> 01:46:22.607]   It's perfect to So, we've got a bunch of callers already lining up on numerous subjects.
[01:46:22.627 --> 01:46:26.569]  We'll probably try to stick to the Twitter World Economic Forum CEO situation.
[01:46:26.409 --> 01:46:29.409]  and fund the info war in the process.
[01:46:29.409 --> 01:46:37.369]   So, we've got a bunch of callers already lining up on numerous subjects.
[01:46:37.369 --> 01:46:42.289]   We'll probably try to stick to the Twitter World Economic Forum CEO situation.
[01:46:42.289 --> 01:46:46.029]  Here's why this is important.
[01:46:46.029 --> 01:46:54.509]   Twitter is, it's hard to get a gauge as what is the number one most influential,
[01:46:54.509 --> 01:46:58.789]  important medium out there for communications.
[01:46:58.785 --> 01:47:01.008]  Or for news, let's say.
[01:47:01.168 --> 01:47:01.870]  News and information.
[01:47:03.027 --> 01:47:15.595]  Most would probably still believe or think it's the television, and that might still be true, but it is only going to be a short period of time longer before it's definitely not the television.
[01:47:15.635 --> 01:47:20.398]  So, TV might still be the number one medium for news and information, but it's debatable.
[01:47:21.258 --> 01:47:22.479]  Because of the internet now.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:33.404]  And for people that are looking for political news and information, if not browsing the different websites, Twitter is definitely the number one medium.
[01:47:34.665 --> 01:47:37.926]  And that's why it's so important to have free speech on Twitter.
[01:47:38.866 --> 01:47:48.431]  And so the information that can be seen and shared on Twitter, we'd hoped, would be information that can change history.
[01:47:50.772 --> 01:47:56.871]   And so if you don't have that access, Then, guess what?
[01:47:56.932 --> 01:48:03.237]  If you can't change history, or someone can stop you from changing history, then they can change history.
[01:48:03.357 --> 01:48:04.458]  Then they can write history.
[01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:05.780]  And that's really what this is all about.
[01:48:07.541 --> 01:48:10.264]  That's what this entire global government is all about.
[01:48:12.205 --> 01:48:13.166]  Them writing history.
[01:48:13.367 --> 01:48:14.327]  Them making history.
[01:48:14.508 --> 01:48:15.749]  Them controlling history.
[01:48:17.133 --> 01:48:17.754]  Not you.
[01:48:18.615 --> 01:48:29.613]  You're not supposed to be able to control history and change history by documenting historical events or sharing the truth about major news stories.
[01:48:31.061 --> 01:48:43.865]  And Twitter was one of the last platforms that had the massive audience that was one of the biggest mediums for news and information, where you could still do that, thanks to Elon Musk making some changes when he took it over.
[01:48:43.925 --> 01:48:52.267]  Now, obviously not perfect, and the World Economic Forum hire as the new CEO, Linda Yassarino, has a lot of people concerned, including myself.
[01:48:53.530 --> 01:49:00.278]  I'm willing to give her a chance and see what happens, but all signs at this point point to not good.
[01:49:01.139 --> 01:49:08.528]  Point to censorship coming back and World Economic Forum influence on Twitter, which would not be good.
[01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:17.309]   Now from an individual perspective, you got to understand, I'm still not allowed to have my private account back.
[01:49:17.429 --> 01:49:22.974]  We've been able to put, people have been able to put some of our videos on Twitter and not get censored, and that's new.
[01:49:23.495 --> 01:49:25.417]  But links to our shows are still censored.
[01:49:26.417 --> 01:49:29.600]  And obviously Alex Jones and others still have not gotten their accounts back.
[01:49:30.681 --> 01:49:38.949]  But aside from that, it's the ability to post videos that you would not have seen otherwise.
[01:49:40.686 --> 01:49:44.947]  It's the ability like Tucker Carlson to completely change the narrative on January 6th.
[01:49:45.648 --> 01:49:57.092]  It's the videos like from subway riders that had the alternate views and perspectives when Penny choked out the deranged subway harasser.
[01:49:59.032 --> 01:50:00.553]  So this is how you can change history.
[01:50:01.553 --> 01:50:03.914]  This is how you can even save people's lives, potentially.
[01:50:04.841 --> 01:50:07.942]  When the media tries to destroy them and the left tries to destroy them and lie about them.
[01:50:08.003 --> 01:50:10.804]  So if we lose that ability on Twitter, that is a major hit.
[01:50:11.164 --> 01:50:11.544]  No doubt.
[01:50:13.865 --> 01:50:22.870]  And we just pick up in the free speech war where we left off where you've got to build your own thing because there's nothing that you're going to have access to if you're trying to tell the truth.
[01:50:26.411 --> 01:50:28.212]  So, we've got callers on this.
[01:50:28.612 --> 01:50:29.533]  Lines are filled now.
[01:50:29.953 --> 01:50:32.014]  So let's start with Kyle in Nebraska.
[01:50:32.494 --> 01:50:33.755]  Kyle, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:33.775 --> 01:50:34.075]  Go ahead.
[01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.709]  Hey Owen.
[01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:37.810]  Hey.
[01:50:39.691 --> 01:50:40.371]  Kyle.
[01:50:41.772 --> 01:50:43.933]  Sorry, a little preoccupied there.
[01:50:43.953 --> 01:50:46.854]  I was working and trying to get back on the phone.
[01:50:47.214 --> 01:50:51.576]  First off, I just wanted to do a quick plug for Allie French.
[01:50:51.395 --> 01:51:02.914]  He is running in this local district here in Nebraska.
[01:51:02.914 --> 01:51:06.195]  And legislative district 23.
[01:51:06.172 --> 01:51:08.514]  Yep, we love Allie.
[01:51:08.634 --> 01:51:12.616]  Yeah, I just want to give her a quick shout out.
[01:51:13.197 --> 01:51:33.330]  And then also, as far as the Elon Musk stuff, I mean, I don't know exactly, I don't have a lot of details on it, but I will say that the projection of everything that's been happening, all this stuff coming out with Biden, as you know, was exactly what they were saying about Trump and his son, all the stuff, every single thing.
[01:51:33.914 --> 01:51:34.274]  There's a video.
[01:51:34.314 --> 01:51:37.076]  In fact, we'll test the crew here a little bit.
[01:51:37.116 --> 01:51:39.558]  It is the ace crew, but I got a tough test from here.
[01:51:39.578 --> 01:51:40.899]  See if you guys can find the video from 2020.
[01:51:40.739 --> 01:51:44.699]   Here's a video, in fact, we'll test the crew here a little bit.
[01:51:44.699 --> 01:51:47.458]  It is the ace crew, but I got a tough test from here.
[01:51:47.458 --> 01:51:50.859]  See if you guys can find the video from 2020.
[01:51:50.859 --> 01:51:55.258]  Joe Biden is in Des Moines, I believe it is.
[01:51:55.258 --> 01:51:58.298]  I think it was after the Democrat debates in Des Moines.
[01:51:58.298 --> 01:51:59.859]  And I was at there too.
[01:51:59.844 --> 01:52:00.764]  I think that's when it was.
[01:52:01.644 --> 01:52:11.528]  And it's afterwards, and the media asks him a question, and he says, because of Trump's phone call with Ukraine, he's unqualified to speak about some deal.
[01:52:11.548 --> 01:52:13.929]  This is not too detailed, the stuff I'm giving to the crew here.
[01:52:14.009 --> 01:52:16.350]  If they can find this one, they're truly the greatest of all time.
[01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:18.050]  But here's why I say this.
[01:52:19.571 --> 01:52:22.552]  Joe Biden speaking to the media says, oh, Trump shouldn't be talking about this.
[01:52:22.592 --> 01:52:28.233]  He's on the phone talking inappropriately to foreign leaders in Ukraine.
[01:52:29.613 --> 01:52:30.674]  And it's like, oh.
[01:52:32.793 --> 01:52:37.132]   As if Joe Biden hasn't been doing that with Zelensky every day.
[01:52:37.132 --> 01:52:43.552]   As if Joe Biden didn't brag about that exact type of phone call in front of the Council
[01:52:43.552 --> 01:52:51.353]   on Foreign Relations when he was able to essentially bribe a Ukrainian prosecutor out of a job
[01:52:51.353 --> 01:52:57.793]  to protect his son, Hunter Biden, and his job with Burisma.
[01:52:57.793 --> 01:53:03.512]   So if we can find that clip, we should almost resurrect that clip and then put it next to
[01:53:03.512 --> 01:53:07.213]   Biden at the World Economic Forum and put it next to Biden having all these meetings
[01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:08.213]  with Zelensky.
[01:53:08.213 --> 01:53:12.753]   So it's like Biden is scolding Trump for exactly what he's doing, but now we have all the proof
[01:53:12.753 --> 01:53:13.753]  of it.
[01:53:13.753 --> 01:53:15.713]  All right, so we found the clip.
[01:53:16.308 --> 01:53:17.268]  I'm going to play it for you.
[01:53:17.308 --> 01:53:20.471]  This is Joe Biden on the campaign trail in Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:53:21.892 --> 01:53:35.883]  And it is Peter Doocy asking him about, I don't know, Doocy's question is not in there, but it's Biden responding to whatever Doocy's question is and pointing the finger at him saying, oh, inappropriate phone calls, inappropriate relations.
[01:53:35.923 --> 01:53:38.666]  And it's the Ukraine situation, that impeachment hoax.
[01:53:39.206 --> 01:53:56.033]   And so now this is even More hilarious in the current context, now that we have all the receipts and video clips, quite frankly, of Joe Biden admitting that everything he's blaming Trump for in this video, he indeed is guilty of.
[01:53:56.273 --> 01:53:57.014]  Trump is innocent.
[01:53:57.434 --> 01:53:57.775]  Here it is.
[01:54:01.579 --> 01:54:02.540]  Here's what I know.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:05.943]  I know Trump deserves to be investigated.
[01:54:06.543 --> 01:54:10.486]  He is violating every basic norm of a president.
[01:54:10.566 --> 01:54:18.533]  You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that's what happened.
[01:54:18.553 --> 01:54:19.534]  That appears what happened.
[01:54:19.554 --> 01:54:21.015]  As Biden is trying to intimidate the U.S.
[01:54:21.155 --> 01:54:22.476]  media with his finger in their face.
[01:54:22.516 --> 01:54:24.278]  He knows I'll beat him like a drum.
[01:54:25.509 --> 01:54:26.309]  Yeah, sure you will.
[01:54:26.369 --> 01:54:33.150]  So here's what we got to do, and I'll just kind of traffic cop this in live time because we just found this clip.
[01:54:34.331 --> 01:54:44.312]  It's going to take a little editing, but you have this clip, and then you have Joe Biden bragging at the Council on Foreign Relations about how he was able to get a prosecutor fired.
[01:54:44.513 --> 01:54:46.313]  So let's play this video now.
[01:54:46.593 --> 01:54:52.254]  We can chop this up and make it more powerful, but now here's Biden bragging about what he just accused Trump of doing.
[01:54:53.370 --> 01:55:01.140]  I remember going over convincing our team or others to convincing us that we should be providing for loan guarantees.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:10.853]  I went over I guess the 12th, 13th time to Kiev and I was supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee.
[01:55:11.774 --> 01:55:20.363]  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor, and they didn't.
[01:55:21.084 --> 01:55:26.870]  So they said they were walking out to the press conference, and I said, no, we're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[01:55:27.791 --> 01:55:30.013]  They said, you have no authority, you're not the president.
[01:55:30.053 --> 01:55:31.475]  The president said, I said, call him.
[01:55:33.154 --> 01:55:35.076]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[01:55:35.776 --> 01:55:37.017]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[01:55:37.057 --> 01:55:39.319]  I'm going to be leaving here, I think it was, what, six hours?
[01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:40.941]  I look, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[01:55:41.441 --> 01:55:43.803]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[01:55:44.543 --> 01:55:45.424]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[01:55:45.444 --> 01:55:47.526]  I got fired.
[01:55:47.906 --> 01:55:50.809]  And they put in place someone who was solid.
[01:55:52.205 --> 01:55:57.989]  And then, of course, there's Joe Biden meeting with Zelensky all the time, giving him hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:55:58.109 --> 01:56:03.512]  Everything that they blame Trump of doing, which he didn't do, they are doing right in front of your face and bragging about it.
[01:56:03.772 --> 01:56:07.454]  I mean, it's so unreal that you can't even believe it.
[01:56:07.834 --> 01:56:08.415]  But there you go.
[01:56:09.656 --> 01:56:10.056]  There it is.
[01:56:12.597 --> 01:56:26.729]   And now we know more, thanks to Republicans in the House doing oversight and actually getting the receipts of all Biden's Foreign dealings, international dealings, and how it's enriched his family to the tunes of millions of dollars.
[01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:29.351]  And Liberal Democrats, they don't even care.
[01:56:29.771 --> 01:56:30.551]  They just eat it up.
[01:56:30.571 --> 01:56:31.412]  They just love Joe Biden.
[01:56:31.432 --> 01:56:32.372]  They're going to vote for him again.
[01:56:33.593 --> 01:56:35.054]  They don't care how much they're lied to.
[01:56:35.074 --> 01:56:36.395]  They don't care how much they're deceived.
[01:56:36.695 --> 01:56:41.217]  They don't care how big of a criminal the guy they voted into the office is.
[01:56:41.257 --> 01:56:42.418]  They just do not care.
[01:56:42.498 --> 01:56:44.879]  As long as they're sticking their thumb in your eye.
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:47.240]  As long as they're taking your freedoms.
[01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:49.682]  As long as they're indoctrinating your children.
[01:56:49.962 --> 01:56:51.543]  As long as they're stealing your money.
[01:56:53.052 --> 01:56:57.294]  I mean, gee, you could do a whole dissertation on everything Joe Biden says in that 30 seconds.
[01:56:57.855 --> 01:57:05.519]  We steal money from the American people, we dangle it out like a carrot on the stick to foreign countries, and we say, hey, you want this money?
[01:57:05.559 --> 01:57:06.399]  It's guaranteed!
[01:57:06.659 --> 01:57:08.720]  You just gotta do exactly what we say!
[01:57:10.822 --> 01:57:16.525]  So yeah, we're in your country committing crimes, but hey, here's that money we stole from the U.S.
[01:57:16.545 --> 01:57:17.005]  taxpayer.
[01:57:17.025 --> 01:57:17.405]  You want it?
[01:57:17.805 --> 01:57:19.286]  Yeah, let us keep doing crimes.
[01:57:20.207 --> 01:57:20.607]  Joe Biden.
[01:57:22.130 --> 01:57:23.091]  Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:57:23.291 --> 01:57:24.052]  Biden crime family.
[01:57:24.092 --> 01:57:24.692]  So, okay.
[01:57:24.932 --> 01:57:26.093]  We got a little off track there.
[01:57:27.914 --> 01:57:30.937]  People are calling in on the Twitter situation, though.
[01:57:31.817 --> 01:57:33.178]  But we got callers all over the board.
[01:57:33.199 --> 01:57:37.142]  But let's go to Laura in Chicago on the new Twitter CEO.
[01:57:37.342 --> 01:57:40.604]  Linda Yasarino from the World Economic Forum.
[01:57:41.445 --> 01:57:42.165]  Laura, go ahead.
[01:57:43.346 --> 01:57:43.987]  Oh, hey Owen.
[01:57:44.027 --> 01:57:46.068]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[01:57:46.349 --> 01:58:01.699]   I couldn't believe he did that because Um, I was on Twitter, you know, I was active, and then he started, um, Twitter started, you know, deplatforming you, Alex, Trump, and so I got off Twitter.
[01:58:01.719 --> 01:58:04.620]  Then I heard, oh, Elon bought it!
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:06.380]  He's gonna let these people back on!
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:13.382]  So, I was like, great, free speech, and so I reactivated my account, and now he's doing this with this new CEO!
[01:58:13.442 --> 01:58:21.900]   It's like a pipeline from the globalist, you know, Charles Schwab, whatever his name is, And I'm like, what is he doing?
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:23.580]  Is he just playing both sides?
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:24.561]  Is this a joke?
[01:58:25.101 --> 01:58:28.962]  So I'm gonna just deactivate my account because I don't know what's up with him.
[01:58:29.002 --> 01:58:31.323]  And it's a pain to go through deactivation.
[01:58:31.904 --> 01:58:34.985]  But I just don't trust it anymore.
[01:58:35.005 --> 01:58:37.086]  It's like he's messing with everybody.
[01:58:37.926 --> 01:58:38.726]  What do you think?
[01:58:40.307 --> 01:58:42.528]  I'm willing to give this lady a chance.
[01:58:44.019 --> 01:58:56.587]  Certainly the World Economic Forum connections are a reason to doubt she's going to maintain the freedom of speech on Twitter that we all would like to see, but I'm willing to give her a chance.
[01:58:56.887 --> 01:59:08.635]   I do think Elon Musk has a, I mean at least maybe not a perfect vision or how we might see it, but he's got a better vision than those who have ran it in the past, those that run the other Big tech agencies, big social media companies.
[01:59:09.516 --> 01:59:11.757]  But look, I'm willing to give her a chance.
[01:59:11.937 --> 01:59:27.228]  All signs right now are, I mean, you know, if I'm a bookie or I'm an odds maker, you know, the odds are, what, four in one, five in one, that she's going to probably bring censorship back to Twitter and probably bring the globalist control back to Twitter.
[01:59:27.268 --> 01:59:30.270]  I'd say that's like the four in one, maybe five in one shot.
[01:59:30.951 --> 01:59:32.632]  So I'm going to give her a chance.
[01:59:34.316 --> 01:59:37.158]  Can I just tell you one more thing that happened with Target?
[01:59:37.178 --> 01:59:43.421]  I was in there and it's all, in the kids clothing section, it's all trans stuff.
[01:59:43.761 --> 01:59:48.344]  Like a little tiny toddler hat with, I don't know if you know that, but I'm boycotting Target.
[01:59:48.364 --> 01:59:52.306]  I mean, they're coming after my kids and I don't know if you guys knew that.
[01:59:52.426 --> 01:59:53.167]  It's so bad.
[01:59:53.447 --> 01:59:54.047]  It's so bad.
[01:59:54.107 --> 01:59:59.110]  There was a CVS, I think it was Jack Posobiec shared this image.
[01:59:59.150 --> 02:00:00.531]  I don't remember if it was his original image.
[02:00:02.384 --> 02:00:03.284]  And it was CVS.
[02:00:03.324 --> 02:00:04.205]  Apparently we have the video.
[02:00:04.225 --> 02:00:04.925]  I don't want to play the video.
[02:00:05.445 --> 02:00:08.466]  But, you know, they have a little toy aisle at CVS.
[02:00:08.526 --> 02:00:09.546]  A little kid's toy aisle.
[02:00:09.946 --> 02:00:14.128]  And then now they put it right next to the sex products.
[02:00:14.388 --> 02:00:17.049]  So, you know, your condoms and your lubes and everything else.
[02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:19.310]  So they got that right next to that for kids.
[02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:20.430]  So, you know, it's good.
[02:00:20.490 --> 02:00:22.210]  And then they got a little rainbow thing for them too.
[02:00:22.751 --> 02:00:23.531]  Yeah, you go into Target.
[02:00:24.928 --> 02:00:27.889]  We've got a local grocery store chain here that I like.
[02:00:28.509 --> 02:00:32.029]  It's a good grocery store chain, and I like to go there.
[02:00:32.069 --> 02:00:38.051]  And now they're sponsoring the Drag Queen Sexy Time for Kids events here in Texas.
[02:00:38.271 --> 02:00:43.372]  And it's just like... So I can't go shop there anymore.
[02:00:43.392 --> 02:00:44.732]  I gotta find a new grocery store.
[02:00:45.552 --> 02:00:46.172]  And it's too bad.
[02:00:46.232 --> 02:00:47.693]  I mean, it's like, I got friends that work there.
[02:00:47.713 --> 02:00:48.293]  It's a great place.
[02:00:48.573 --> 02:00:49.573]  And now it's like, oh, you wanna...
[02:00:50.404 --> 02:00:54.546]  You want to do the trans kids, sexualization, grooming of kids agenda?
[02:00:54.726 --> 02:00:55.087]  I can't.
[02:00:55.687 --> 02:00:55.747]  No.
[02:00:55.767 --> 02:00:57.848]  You're going to have to get a message on that.
[02:00:58.749 --> 02:01:00.049]  One more thing, okay?
[02:01:00.089 --> 02:01:06.993]  I'm an Army veteran, you know, I worked at VA, and I feel like I'm a traitor to my nation.
[02:01:07.794 --> 02:01:11.395]  And no one in my agency... What are you, what are you down at the border bringing in illegals?
[02:01:12.576 --> 02:01:12.936]  No!
[02:01:13.437 --> 02:01:15.458]  But I'm a veteran contract, you know, a contract...
[02:01:16.598 --> 02:01:25.440]  I mean, we run a small business with the VA, you know, so veterans can get healthcare and users on the schedule, but HHS orders off of our schedule.
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:29.601]  And I feel like no one in VA contract is talking about this.
[02:01:30.101 --> 02:01:31.741]  No one in the government is talking about this.
[02:01:31.781 --> 02:01:35.722]  When I said something about COVID, I was immediately shut down three years ago.
[02:01:36.242 --> 02:01:38.182]  And I tried to save as many people as I could.
[02:01:38.202 --> 02:01:41.003]  You know, I got them all religious exemptions because they were going to fire us.
[02:01:42.276 --> 02:01:49.444]  Oh yeah, I'm gonna talk more about this on The War Room, but let's not forget what they did to us with these vaccines that they now admit don't even work.
[02:01:51.145 --> 02:01:56.691]  And I'm taking your calls the next two segments, and then I'm gonna be doing...
[02:01:57.817 --> 02:02:03.240]  Massive news coverage as I'll be back in studio hosting the War Room 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:03.780]  Central.
[02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:13.825]  That's when we're gonna have a lot of the breaking news coverage and some kind of closing final coverage of what we did at the border as well with some unseen footage.
[02:02:14.426 --> 02:02:20.149]  But we go back to the phone lines and let's go to JD in Indiana.
[02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:21.929]  JD, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:24.751]  Hey, what's up Owen?
[02:02:26.468 --> 02:02:31.330]  Um, so I'm actually calling, um, I've been banned now for three days off of Twitter.
[02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:39.254]  Well, I'm actually in, um, I guess you would call it appeal jail, um, over Greg Grease and Jon Bowne's videos.
[02:02:39.574 --> 02:02:40.915]  They're the latest ones on the border.
[02:02:41.215 --> 02:02:45.457]  So I would most definitely believe that censorship is coming back.
[02:02:46.778 --> 02:02:48.799]  Which videos did you share that got you banned?
[02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:53.677]  They were the new ones about the border crossings that they had just released.
[02:02:54.178 --> 02:02:55.118]  That's odd.
[02:02:55.358 --> 02:02:55.898]  That is odd.
[02:02:56.138 --> 02:02:56.378]  Yeah.
[02:02:57.319 --> 02:02:57.899]  Absolutely.
[02:02:58.179 --> 02:02:59.820]  It's JDX Night.
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:01.801]  Literally, I am right now.
[02:03:01.861 --> 02:03:03.281]  I had to appeal those videos.
[02:03:03.301 --> 02:03:05.022]  They said that those videos were violent.
[02:03:06.144 --> 02:03:07.424]  Yeah, I mean, here's the problem.
[02:03:07.464 --> 02:03:08.144]  Here's the problem.
[02:03:08.384 --> 02:03:13.766]  I wouldn't take a blanket understanding from you getting censored or banned or whatever.
[02:03:14.526 --> 02:03:20.867]  There's still leftists in there, and there's still leftists that can get in and control the flow with the community notes.
[02:03:21.447 --> 02:03:25.068]  So, I mean, it's not a perfect enterprise.
[02:03:25.608 --> 02:03:30.089]  There's definitely still leftists jacked into it, censoring stuff they don't like.
[02:03:31.789 --> 02:03:36.552]  So that might not be the new CEO Linda Yasserino's doing.
[02:03:37.592 --> 02:03:38.873]  In fact, I would say it's not.
[02:03:38.973 --> 02:03:40.414]  I don't even believe she is the CEO yet.
[02:03:40.474 --> 02:03:47.378]  So that's still just the same old problem of leftists in there that hate seeing information and facts that they don't like and censoring you.
[02:03:48.899 --> 02:03:49.619]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:49.639 --> 02:03:58.585]  Because a lot of those videos, especially that are especially eye-opening, they leave me in appeal jail for quite some time over those.
[02:04:01.311 --> 02:04:06.837]  Yeah, so you've just been struck by some other dirty commie out there that hates seeing our videos.
[02:04:07.658 --> 02:04:12.965]  And really, if Linda wants to make a positive outcome in her first...
[02:04:14.349 --> 02:04:15.250]  You know, let's say month.
[02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:16.731]  I don't know when she's supposed to start.
[02:04:16.751 --> 02:04:18.312]  I think it's maybe June.
[02:04:19.132 --> 02:04:20.313]  She should come in and clean it up.
[02:04:20.473 --> 02:04:32.160]  Now, I think community notes overall do probably a good job, but there's no doubt the leftists that are still jacked into the system and try to overwhelm the community notes are still censoring stuff that they just don't like and lying about it.
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:33.141]  JD, thanks for the call.
[02:04:33.881 --> 02:04:36.623]  Let's go to Sean in California.
[02:04:37.544 --> 02:04:38.584]  Sean, you are on the air.
[02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.005]  Go ahead.
[02:04:40.165 --> 02:04:41.286]  Hey, good morning, Owen.
[02:04:41.326 --> 02:04:42.287]  Are you reading me loud and clear?
[02:04:42.427 --> 02:04:42.607]  Yes.
[02:04:43.695 --> 02:04:44.035]  Awesome.
[02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:49.401]  Hey, I gotta agree with you on your point about Twitter, that we can't get too comfortable with it.
[02:04:49.521 --> 02:04:56.107]  In the virtual world, for example, a mutual friend of ours on Facebook, Chris Pro, they censored him covering Liberty Broadcast.
[02:04:56.928 --> 02:05:03.434]  Twitter censored him tweeting, HB 14 being passed through the Texas Senate, which bans child genital mutilation.
[02:05:04.035 --> 02:05:07.118]  So they're doing the censorship like the previous caller just said.
[02:05:07.845 --> 02:05:16.467]  And so before we get comfortable with these World Economic Forum people going back to the old Twitter, we've got to realize in the real world, you mentioned the term access.
[02:05:16.887 --> 02:05:21.409]  Because we're not able to share news, access to certain news points has been missed out on.
[02:05:21.869 --> 02:05:24.569]  Last week, the Supreme Court made a ruling.
[02:05:24.849 --> 02:05:26.750]  I'd love for you to write this down if you can.
[02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:32.491]  A-X-O-N, Axon, Enterprise, comma, Incorporated versus FTC.
[02:05:33.372 --> 02:05:34.692]  And that decision came down.
[02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:41.694]  And the people are now allowed to have access to common law, equity, or statutory jurisdiction.
[02:05:41.774 --> 02:05:47.037]  The judges don't get to decide that anymore, which means the court systems will now have remedy against the people.
[02:05:47.417 --> 02:05:51.839]  It should clear up a lot of things, so check with Norm Padish, Robert Barnes, etc.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:55.601]  But the word on that getting out is like molasses coming off a tree.
[02:05:55.621 --> 02:05:56.662]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:05:57.422 --> 02:06:01.805]  It is something we should be celebrating as a silver lining that there's some more remedy out there.
[02:06:03.215 --> 02:06:09.498]  Are you up for me, Owen, plugging national-assembly.net and letting people know that they can find more about it in our forums?
[02:06:09.678 --> 02:06:15.501]  Or, you know, you want to take that idea, hit up Robert Barnes, Axon, Enterprise, Incorporated versus FTC?
[02:06:17.121 --> 02:06:17.922]  And that's the website?
[02:06:19.322 --> 02:06:20.903]  Yeah, national-assembly.net.
[02:06:20.923 --> 02:06:22.844]  We have a thread on that in our general forums.
[02:06:23.539 --> 02:06:27.201]  And the ruling is Axon Enterprise Incorporated versus FTC.
[02:06:27.561 --> 02:06:33.164]  So they will be separate dockets for common law, equitable law, and administrative law, which is statutory.
[02:06:33.635 --> 02:06:39.499]  So the problem was the courts used to slam everything together under statutory to make money off the people.
[02:06:40.019 --> 02:06:48.025]  You know, because they could fine you, fine you, fine you, like they used to do in Ferguson, like they're trying to do to you, to Alex with the billion dollar lawsuits, all that stuff.
[02:06:48.245 --> 02:06:53.488]  Well, this gets it back to actually like a common law situation is just to make restitution and make someone old.
[02:06:53.949 --> 02:06:58.672]  It's not to go over the top with all these defamation claims and keep milking people for money.
[02:06:58.832 --> 02:07:08.160]  I don't have full understanding, but that would be one solution to what we've seen now in this lawfare that gets waged against political opposition.
[02:07:08.890 --> 02:07:12.910]   Where they just they just they just reach for ludicrous numbers, and they don't have to prove anything
[02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:18.989]   Nobody has to prove damages nobody have shown these bills Yes, you don't have to show any evidence you just say oh
[02:07:18.989 --> 02:07:24.990]   this happened, and so I want billions of dollars They say okay like well doing John for what oh?
[02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:31.069]   So yeah, that's good to know Sean. Thanks for sharing that with us. Let's go to
[02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:34.310]  Will in Nevada will you're on the air go ahead?
[02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:39.130]   Hey Great job. You guys doing it in the wars um
[02:07:39.130 --> 02:07:43.749]   About Twitter. I just want to say that I'm subscribed to over
[02:07:43.749 --> 02:07:50.289]   2,000 different people and Twitter has taken it upon themselves to feed me nothing, but violent imagery
[02:07:50.289 --> 02:07:55.327]   day after day usually black on white crime I I never asked for that.
[02:07:55.387 --> 02:08:04.950]  Now they've sprinkled in some trans men images, some pretty lewd... So you're saying that this is what shows up on your Twitter feed?
[02:08:06.129 --> 02:08:06.789]  Yeah, every day.
[02:08:06.809 --> 02:08:10.410]  I'm subscribed to over 2,000 people and that's the only thing that they show me.
[02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:16.132]  Now, are you aware, are you aware that there's basically, you can get access to two different news feeds?
[02:08:16.552 --> 02:08:22.094]  You get the access to the news feed that's called For You, or you can get access to the news feed that's just the people you're following?
[02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:23.434]  You may want to switch that.
[02:08:24.773 --> 02:08:25.874]  Y'all have to look into that.
[02:08:26.214 --> 02:08:41.561]  I'm not sure of those settings, but that's... My guess is you're getting the news feed that's for you and not the people you're following, and so because of the types of people you follow and what they retweet or what they're following, that's probably why you're getting that stuff.
[02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:50.345]  There's no doubt that there's an overwhelming amount of that black-on-white crime that's being fed through Twitter right now, and obviously the trans stuff as well.
[02:08:51.085 --> 02:08:55.669]  So, uh, and I mean, look, we can, we can sit here and talk about why that's going on.
[02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:57.210]  That's not, I'm not here to have that debate.
[02:08:58.051 --> 02:09:01.514]  Uh, but if you don't want to see that anymore, you need to change your settings.
[02:09:01.534 --> 02:09:03.115]  The crew is showing you right on the screen here.
[02:09:03.175 --> 02:09:04.797]  You can go to following or for you.
[02:09:04.837 --> 02:09:10.501]  When you go to for you, that opens up the feed to people you don't follow and stuff you might not want to see.
[02:09:12.122 --> 02:09:12.482]  Yeah, right on.
[02:09:12.522 --> 02:09:14.203]  I'll check that out.
[02:09:14.023 --> 02:09:17.222]  or stuff you're just sick of being forced into your feed.
[02:09:17.222 --> 02:09:20.402]   And if you had a following, you have a little more of a control over,
[02:09:20.402 --> 02:09:22.682]   a little more control mechanism over what you're actually seeing.
[02:09:22.682 --> 02:09:24.243]  That's only gonna be from accounts you're following.
[02:09:24.243 --> 02:09:29.042]   So I would give that a try and see if that doesn't solve the problem for you.
[02:09:29.042 --> 02:09:30.721]  Yeah, right on, I'll check that out.
[02:09:30.721 --> 02:09:35.002]   I also have ideas for the whole migrant situation, if you wanna go there.
[02:09:35.002 --> 02:09:35.842]  Go ahead.
[02:09:35.842 --> 02:09:40.283]  What I would do is I would tell them to stay put.
[02:09:40.278 --> 02:09:43.319]  Pretty much give them a designated area, tell them to stay there.
[02:09:43.359 --> 02:09:54.061]  They'll be provided with rations, food, water rations, and then instructions on how they're going to build their own community, making houses mostly out of sand.
[02:09:54.501 --> 02:10:01.483]  I tried to look it up just now, but my internet got cut off, but there's this guy on YouTube who digs these mansions out of the dirt.
[02:10:02.023 --> 02:10:04.490]   So, Shelter is not the problem.
[02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:14.638]  The problem is the relationship with governments coming around thinking that they have the right to then shove everyone out of those shelters while not providing shelter themselves.
[02:10:15.098 --> 02:10:16.159]  So here's the problem.
[02:10:16.179 --> 02:10:16.860]  Here's the problem.
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:17.680]  Thanks for the call, Will.
[02:10:18.821 --> 02:10:19.342]  Here's the problem.
[02:10:20.022 --> 02:10:20.683]  And we all do this.
[02:10:22.964 --> 02:10:29.850]  We are too focused on the border as some sort of isolated issue.
[02:10:31.642 --> 02:10:38.185]  Obviously the open border, the illegal immigration pipeline and everything that comes with it is a problem.
[02:10:39.306 --> 02:10:42.047]  But we have to understand this is being done by design.
[02:10:43.568 --> 02:10:53.693]  This is being consciously done by design by a group of individuals that are looking to form a corporate world government.
[02:10:54.909 --> 02:10:55.909]  That's what this is about.
[02:10:56.809 --> 02:11:07.492]  So yes, we can talk about the border and highlight that as an issue and even look into solutions, but the real solution is getting the globalist influence out of our country.
[02:11:07.752 --> 02:11:12.393]  The real solution is getting World Economic Forum interests out of our country.
[02:11:13.033 --> 02:11:16.334]  And UNICEF, and the UN, and the World Health Organization.
[02:11:17.154 --> 02:11:20.155]  That's how you stop the illegal immigration pipeline.
[02:11:20.515 --> 02:11:21.435]  Those are the ones running it.
[02:11:22.836 --> 02:11:25.577]  Our last segment of your calls, then Gerald Celente takes over.
[02:11:25.597 --> 02:11:28.237]  I'll be back hosting the War Room with all the latest breaking news.
[02:11:29.417 --> 02:11:34.438]  Let's take a couple more calls, though, before Celente takes over.
[02:11:35.178 --> 02:11:39.099]  And let's go to Gene in Georgia, switching it up a little bit, going to the border now.
[02:11:39.179 --> 02:11:40.079]  Gene, you're on the air.
[02:11:40.099 --> 02:11:40.499]  Go ahead.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:48.701]  Brother Sawyer, God bless you and Infant Wars for all the things y'all doing with truth.
[02:11:50.167 --> 02:11:54.210]  Besides God's word, the Bible, I don't know where you can find more truth.
[02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:58.312]  But, uh, just to let you know what I get.
[02:11:58.392 --> 02:12:15.583]  Well, first of all, the thing I didn't call about, um, the Twitter thing with Musk, but, uh, I mean, to shoot a rocket up into space and bring it back on a platform in the middle of the ocean, you might as well believe, uh, man walked on the moon.
[02:12:16.104 --> 02:12:18.105]  But besides that, I wanted to talk about the children.
[02:12:19.708 --> 02:12:22.792]  Um, where are the children Alex asked earlier?
[02:12:23.132 --> 02:12:23.853]  Where are they going?
[02:12:24.374 --> 02:12:26.857]  I mean, where do the children go?
[02:12:27.578 --> 02:12:32.824]  And I was my question to you was basically all the time you spent this past weekend at the border.
[02:12:34.645 --> 02:12:39.524]   I didn't notice of all the past videos, I didn't notice many children with anybody.
[02:12:39.524 --> 02:12:40.524]  I mean...
[02:12:40.524 --> 02:12:41.685]  No, I pointed that out.
[02:12:41.685 --> 02:12:46.685]   I pointed that out in a report that I did, how when we were in McAllen, it was like we
[02:12:46.685 --> 02:12:50.925]  saw pregnant women and children all the time.
[02:12:50.925 --> 02:12:55.125]  But not in El Paso.
[02:12:55.051 --> 02:12:58.995]  It was mostly military-aged men, as was for middle-aged men, young men.
[02:12:59.015 --> 02:13:00.756]  It was mostly that.
[02:13:00.816 --> 02:13:02.677]  I didn't see too many kids at all.
[02:13:03.098 --> 02:13:04.859]  And actually, we got more footage coming as well.
[02:13:04.919 --> 02:13:10.223]  I mean, even at the airport, when you were at the airport in McAllen, you'd still see pregnant women, kids everywhere.
[02:13:10.904 --> 02:13:12.765]  The situation in El Paso, completely different.
[02:13:12.825 --> 02:13:13.946]  Not too many kids.
[02:13:14.006 --> 02:13:19.524]   If they were kids, they were They were up there in ages, even maybe teenagers.
[02:13:19.924 --> 02:13:22.447]  We're not talking about infants, toddlers, young children.
[02:13:23.407 --> 02:13:27.551]  So, I don't know what's causing that phenomenon as far as where did the children go.
[02:13:27.571 --> 02:13:31.534]  I mean, again, ask Alejandro Mayorkas.
[02:13:31.795 --> 02:13:36.879]  Now, we don't have a real media, so he doesn't have to ask and answer questions like that.
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:42.884]  Sadly, I think we got a taste of what happens to these children, and this is why they buried the story.
[02:13:42.904 --> 02:13:43.505]  There was a story.
[02:13:44.653 --> 02:14:17.518]   About a woman who had to cross state lines, this was probably about a year ago, a woman had to cross state lines to get an abortion, I believe it was for a 14 year old girl, and then once the information was coming out that there might have been illegal immigrants involved in this potential rape, I mean it's a 14 year old girl, so I mean, call it what you want, but It turned out that there might have been some illegal immigrants involved, or maybe this girl was getting sex trafficked, and then all of a sudden the story disappeared, you noticed.
[02:14:18.119 --> 02:14:22.240]  So when it was about abortion and abortion access, the mainstream media was all over it.
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:27.702]  But then when they found out, oh, there might be some illegal immigration story here, they covered it up.
[02:14:27.822 --> 02:14:30.383]  So that might give us a hint of where the children go.
[02:14:31.683 --> 02:14:32.043]  Sadly.
[02:14:32.524 --> 02:14:33.084]  Sadly, Gene.
[02:14:33.124 --> 02:14:33.824]  Thank you for the call.
[02:14:34.404 --> 02:14:36.245]  Let's go to James in Oklahoma.
[02:14:36.305 --> 02:14:37.205]  James, you're on the air.
[02:14:37.245 --> 02:14:37.645]  Go ahead.
[02:14:38.886 --> 02:14:39.246]  Hey, Alan.
[02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:42.771]  I want to thank you for your reports on the border.
[02:14:43.071 --> 02:14:49.356]  You did a great job, and I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say we really, really appreciate it.
[02:14:50.177 --> 02:14:55.561]  And with Elon Musk, we know he's been a member of the World Economic Forum since at least 2008.
[02:14:56.742 --> 02:15:03.187]  He pushed a bunch of transhumanist ideas, and then out of nowhere we were just supposed to support him because he privately owned a company.
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:15.305]  And because he privately owned this company, he brought back some people, but obviously he didn't really care too much about free speech because he didn't bring you guys back, which, you know, you're the main proponents against globalism right now.
[02:15:15.885 --> 02:15:16.205]  Anywhere.
[02:15:16.465 --> 02:15:18.566]  You look anywhere, you guys are the main fighters against it.
[02:15:19.706 --> 02:15:24.408]  And, um, Linda Iaccarino, she was, uh, you know, she was pushing COVID.
[02:15:24.428 --> 02:15:31.831]  You watch all these videos about what she says and how she, uh, carries herself and all the, uh, information she's pushed out.
[02:15:32.594 --> 02:15:34.196]  And it gets you really suspicious about her.
[02:15:34.676 --> 02:15:37.940]  And then Trump hired her in 2018.
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:42.124]  Now, with Donald Trump, I don't trust him.
[02:15:42.724 --> 02:15:45.948]  I think he's called Klaus Schwab a great man.
[02:15:47.529 --> 02:15:48.570]  They've met a couple times.
[02:15:48.651 --> 02:15:49.892]  It's just, I don't know.
[02:15:49.952 --> 02:15:52.294]  We've got to stop putting our faith in the billionaires to save us.
[02:15:52.835 --> 02:15:53.896]  And we have to save us.
[02:15:54.136 --> 02:15:54.817]  That's the only way.
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:58.621]  Yeah, there's no doubt.
[02:15:58.721 --> 02:16:02.746]  I mean, look, I think Elon Musk is saying and doing a lot of good things.
[02:16:02.766 --> 02:16:12.977]  There's just things that he says that are so damaging to the New World Order and the globalists that, I mean, you have to say it's worthy of praise.
[02:16:13.017 --> 02:16:14.799]  Now, I'm not saying you have to trust Elon Musk.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:16.381]  I'm not even saying he's...
[02:16:18.035 --> 02:16:20.898]  Well, he's also been completely silent about this, too.
[02:16:21.279 --> 02:16:23.201]  Everyone's been critical and they're asking him about it.
[02:16:24.222 --> 02:16:25.464]  Well, he has been silent.
[02:16:25.524 --> 02:16:26.445]  He's made some statements.
[02:16:27.026 --> 02:16:28.007]  He has made some statements.
[02:16:29.328 --> 02:16:34.394]  Well, not directly addressing the World Economic Forum connections, and that's what everyone's complaining about.
[02:16:34.755 --> 02:16:37.238]  He says that it's still going to be transparent and free speech.
[02:16:37.554 --> 02:16:42.192]   But you guys still aren't on there and the whole excuse of Sandy Hook is complete bullcrap.
[02:16:42.192 --> 02:16:43.192]  Like...
[02:16:43.192 --> 02:16:47.273]   Look, I don't want to sit here as a binary and say if I'm not allowed back on Twitter
[02:16:47.273 --> 02:16:51.754]   then it's a failed thing or if Alex Jones isn't allowed back on Twitter then it's a
[02:16:51.754 --> 02:16:52.754]  failed thing.
[02:16:52.754 --> 02:16:57.753]  I'm not going to have that approach because it's fine.
[02:16:57.747 --> 02:16:58.287]  It's the way it is.
[02:16:58.308 --> 02:17:04.289]  Like you said, we're the source of the toughest levels of resistance to the New World Order, so it's always going to be that way.
[02:17:04.329 --> 02:17:05.389]  That's just written in the stars.
[02:17:06.609 --> 02:17:17.672]  It's the fact that we can still put videos out and go viral, even if we don't have our accounts, even if we don't have our accounts with millions of followers, that other people can still put our videos out and not get censored.
[02:17:18.212 --> 02:17:19.932]  And so that did happen.
[02:17:19.972 --> 02:17:22.113]  Now, will that be happening in a year from now?
[02:17:22.933 --> 02:17:25.634]  At this rate, with the new World Economic Forum lady in charge?
[02:17:25.894 --> 02:17:26.575]  I don't know.
[02:17:26.895 --> 02:17:27.715]  Time will tell.
[02:17:27.975 --> 02:17:29.076]  I'm gonna wait and see.
[02:17:29.636 --> 02:17:43.182]  But obviously, like I said earlier, I look at this, I'd say the odds are, we're about 4-1, 5-1, that you're gonna start seeing Twitter censorship again before the 2024 presidential election.
[02:17:44.003 --> 02:17:44.983]  I'd say the odds are with that.
[02:17:45.023 --> 02:17:45.924]  But I'm gonna give her a chance.
[02:17:46.224 --> 02:17:47.404]  I'm willing to give her a chance.
[02:17:47.904 --> 02:17:48.805]  And so let's find out.
[02:17:49.065 --> 02:17:51.046]  Just like I was willing to give Kevin McCarthy a chance.
[02:17:51.266 --> 02:17:52.748]  I was not a proponent of his.
[02:17:53.328 --> 02:17:56.812]  I was against his nomination for Speaker of the House, but he got it.
[02:17:56.832 --> 02:17:57.733]  I said, let's give him a chance.
[02:17:57.773 --> 02:18:01.497]  Well, he's had over a month, a couple months now, and he's been a failure.
[02:18:01.557 --> 02:18:02.558]  He's batting zero.
[02:18:02.898 --> 02:18:03.819]  He does nothing.
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:10.446]  I don't know what he does, other than go on TV maybe once a week or once a month, but he's been a non-factor.
[02:18:10.466 --> 02:18:11.186]  So gave him a chance.
[02:18:11.247 --> 02:18:11.747]  It was a failure.
[02:18:11.787 --> 02:18:12.708]  I'm willing to give her a chance.
[02:18:13.649 --> 02:18:14.230]  Time will tell.
[02:18:15.111 --> 02:18:20.254]  Alright, let's go to Membrane in Toronto.
[02:18:20.334 --> 02:18:21.695]  Membrane, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:18:22.576 --> 02:18:25.378]  Hey Owen, first of all, thanks for all your work at the border.
[02:18:25.398 --> 02:18:26.919]  I'm happy to support the NFL War.
[02:18:27.719 --> 02:18:29.460]  My superpower is I do have a memory.
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:39.067]  I remember Dr. Francis Boyle being on the Alex Jones Show multiple times and he went through the Henry Kissinger PhD program and he turned out to be a good guy.
[02:18:39.127 --> 02:18:45.497]   So I don't think the Emperor Expected it was going to be Darth Vader that threw him down the mineshaft.
[02:18:47.478 --> 02:18:48.098]  Two more things.
[02:18:48.238 --> 02:18:55.760]  I've got to tell you about an X-Files episode, but I remember the lead up to the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games.
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.721]  13 northern states, border to border, northern border.
[02:18:58.981 --> 02:19:00.622]  It was the largest unsecured border in the world.
[02:19:00.642 --> 02:19:05.663]  They went piece by piece and locked it down with ground sensors, blimps, balloons.
[02:19:06.163 --> 02:19:07.463]  Guys in the booth can look this up.
[02:19:07.644 --> 02:19:14.442]   Obama and Stephen Harper had Predator drones flying up and down the river between Detroit and Windsor.
[02:19:15.122 --> 02:19:18.465]  I mean, so did you see any predator drones when you were down there, Owen?
[02:19:19.807 --> 02:19:21.308]  No, I don't think I saw any drones.
[02:19:21.468 --> 02:19:24.151]  Well, I did see drones from media filming stuff.
[02:19:24.171 --> 02:19:27.294]  We had a drone down there, but no, no government security drones.
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:31.381]  Okay, well, also I gotta tell you about this X-Files episode.
[02:19:31.441 --> 02:19:32.321]  It's called SR-819.
[02:19:33.522 --> 02:19:40.904]  And the premise of the episode is Assistant Director Skinner gets poisoned with a self-replicating nanotechnology.
[02:19:41.445 --> 02:19:47.367]  And the Russian spy Krychek can turn up the electromagnetic signal and they start to form clots.
[02:19:47.847 --> 02:19:51.948]  And Skinner screams out in pain and then he can turn down the signal and they don't form clots.
[02:19:52.328 --> 02:19:58.530]   But the money shot on this episode Yeah, I think we've actually used that clip in some special reports we've done.
[02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:59.390]  Guys, do you remember this?
[02:19:59.410 --> 02:20:01.191]  I feel like I've seen that clip.
[02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:04.610]  and he's like, "Oh, that's self-replicating nanotechnology."
[02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:06.689]  And she's like, "Boulder, it can't be.
[02:20:06.689 --> 02:20:09.289]  "That technology is decades away."
[02:20:09.289 --> 02:20:14.730]   Yeah, I think we've actually used that clip in some special reports we've done.
[02:20:14.730 --> 02:20:16.050]  Guys, do you remember this?
[02:20:16.050 --> 02:20:18.729]  I feel like I've seen that clip.
[02:20:18.729 --> 02:20:21.450]  I feel like I know the exact clip you're talking about.
[02:20:21.450 --> 02:20:29.130]   Oh, well, I've seen you air other clips, not this one from episode, it's called SR819.
[02:20:29.096 --> 02:20:31.257]  And a quick note to the FBI.
[02:20:31.678 --> 02:20:38.522]  While everyone's looking at the southern border, I know Gretchen Whitmer's tried to shut down the Line 5 pipeline for years.
[02:20:38.983 --> 02:20:42.425]  And when Democrats say they're going to shut down a pipeline, I believe them.
[02:20:42.725 --> 02:20:43.826]  Well, she ran on that.
[02:20:44.406 --> 02:20:49.489]  We're not going to believe the FBI if they say a bunch of white supremacists blew up the Line 5 pipeline.
[02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:52.010]  Yeah.
[02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:53.732]  So I just want that to be on record.
[02:20:53.952 --> 02:20:56.354]  Well, we already know that they, uh, yeah, thank you for the call.
[02:20:56.615 --> 02:21:06.083]  We already know that they run false flags in Michigan and then charge the people that they entrapped with that fake kidnap, uh, the governor plot that the feds were running.
[02:21:06.123 --> 02:21:08.906]  And then they entrapped some guys and arrested them and claimed that they were the heroes.
[02:21:09.665 --> 02:21:13.729]  And the one guy that was leading the charge abused his spouse.
[02:21:14.370 --> 02:21:17.933]  He was obviously a sex addict that also abused his spouse.
[02:21:18.654 --> 02:21:23.579]  So that's the kind of people that run these operations and then they entrap other Americans.
[02:21:23.619 --> 02:21:25.420]  So yeah, if anybody out there...
[02:21:26.434 --> 02:21:29.616]  He's trying to convince you to be an eco-terrorist in Michigan.
[02:21:30.417 --> 02:21:34.559]  You're probably getting set up by the Feds and the Democrats.
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:40.724]  But hey, she just ran on shutting down a pipeline, just like Joe Biden promised that they would shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and then it blew up.
[02:21:40.864 --> 02:21:41.944]  But oh, we don't know who did that.
[02:21:41.964 --> 02:21:43.726]  All right, Gerald Celente hosting now.
[02:21:43.565 --> 02:22:01.444]   I'll be taking over hosting the war room coming up in an hour.
[02:22:02.176 --> 02:22:10.805]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:22:11.165 --> 02:22:13.367]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:22:14.008 --> 02:22:16.789]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:25.290]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:22:25.810 --> 02:22:35.692]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:22:36.252 --> 02:22:41.573]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands-down the best.
[02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:47.702]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:22:48.223 --> 02:22:54.473]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:22:54.833 --> 02:22:55.694]  Good evening, everybody.
[02:22:58.578 --> 02:23:00.179]  There's not even the same universe.
[02:23:00.319 --> 02:23:03.521]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell.
[02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:17.470]  People around her say, she's so dark now, and so evil, and so possessed, that they are having nightmares, they're freaking out, but they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:20.292]  Whiskey bottles and brand new cars.
[02:23:21.869 --> 02:23:28.133]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:23:28.193 --> 02:23:32.216]  Can I have two words for you?
[02:23:32.235 --> 02:23:34.235]  At this point, does it make sense?
[02:23:34.235 --> 02:23:36.235]  Ooh, that smell!
[02:23:36.235 --> 02:23:38.235]  I have two words for you.
[02:23:38.235 --> 02:23:40.235]  Can't you smell that smell?
[02:23:40.235 --> 02:23:42.235]  But it's a grub.
[02:23:42.235 --> 02:23:44.235]  Ooh, that smell!
[02:23:44.235 --> 02:23:48.235]  The smell of gasoline!
[02:23:47.963 --> 02:23:48.224]  I died.
[02:23:48.284 --> 02:23:50.145]  There's a guy on the radio.
[02:23:50.225 --> 02:23:52.926]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[02:23:53.006 --> 02:23:55.568]  He said we smell like something.
[02:23:55.728 --> 02:23:57.369]  Ain't that something?
[02:23:57.489 --> 02:23:59.570]  I'm not just being tacky.
[02:23:59.489 --> 02:24:03.489]  I'm not just being tacky, I'm calling Margaret Neal a smuggler.
[02:24:03.489 --> 02:24:06.489]  I have never seen or smelled anyone like that.
[02:24:26.489 --> 02:24:32.886]   Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic It's Alex Jones.
[02:24:33.006 --> 02:24:33.526]  Film that.
[02:24:33.365 --> 02:24:47.365]  [Music]
[02:24:47.365 --> 02:24:49.365]  Film that. There it is.
[02:24:49.365 --> 02:24:50.365]  [Music]
[02:24:50.365 --> 02:24:54.365]   There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[02:24:54.365 --> 02:25:01.365]  [Laughter]
[02:25:01.365 --> 02:25:13.365]  [Music]
[02:25:13.662 --> 02:25:24.091]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[02:25:25.292 --> 02:25:26.153]  In a big way.
[02:25:26.373 --> 02:25:28.075]  If your calling is media, fine.
[02:25:28.115 --> 02:25:29.957]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[02:25:30.477 --> 02:25:32.159]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[02:25:32.759 --> 02:25:33.120]  Now.
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:38.585]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos.
[02:25:39.285 --> 02:25:44.010]  Of these Facebooks, and these tweets, and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[02:25:44.651 --> 02:25:45.832]  This is ghetto.
[02:25:46.232 --> 02:25:46.993]  This is ghetto.
[02:25:47.033 --> 02:25:47.934]  This is corporate.
[02:25:47.954 --> 02:25:50.517]  They're taking your energy.
[02:25:50.997 --> 02:25:53.299]  They're taking your energy, and you're getting nothing in return.
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:54.040]  Nothing.
[02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:55.301]  They're dumbing the language down.
[02:25:55.542 --> 02:25:57.423]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language.
[02:25:57.664 --> 02:25:58.645]  Directly out of 1984, it's Ingsoc.
[02:26:00.206 --> 02:26:03.649]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:26:03.669 --> 02:26:05.070]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:07.632]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:26:07.892 --> 02:26:08.473]  You're out of there.
[02:26:08.673 --> 02:26:10.995]  They're gonna make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[02:26:11.315 --> 02:26:18.140]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[02:26:18.501 --> 02:26:19.802]  Time is not forever.
[02:26:20.142 --> 02:26:23.245]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[02:26:24.045 --> 02:26:25.066]  Uh, rise and fall.
[02:26:25.286 --> 02:26:26.247]  There's not that many.
[02:26:26.387 --> 02:26:27.888]  It's a small amount.
[02:26:28.368 --> 02:26:33.952]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[02:26:34.052 --> 02:26:34.273]  No.
[02:26:34.513 --> 02:26:35.373]  No, you can't.
[02:26:35.454 --> 02:26:37.355]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[02:26:37.535 --> 02:26:42.459]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[02:26:42.739 --> 02:26:44.740]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[02:26:45.081 --> 02:26:47.522]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[02:26:47.803 --> 02:26:48.583]  This is insane.
[02:26:48.663 --> 02:26:51.886]   And you had the justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[02:26:52.186 --> 02:26:54.428]  Now, remember just recently... We're getting it lined up with it.
[02:26:54.688 --> 02:26:57.151]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[02:26:57.171 --> 02:26:58.812]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[02:26:59.192 --> 02:27:00.994]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[02:27:01.054 --> 02:27:11.804]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[02:27:14.508 --> 02:27:16.611]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:22.950]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:50.950]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:55.023]  And, uh, you know, I don't know if I'm going to be doing Alex Jones anymore.
[02:27:55.043 --> 02:27:56.384]  I want to make this announcement.
[02:27:57.065 --> 02:28:02.028]  Because, um, Chat, uh, GPT is much smarter than me.
[02:28:03.049 --> 02:28:07.012]  And, uh, there's no, there's no sense in me saying anything anymore.
[02:28:07.092 --> 02:28:12.416]  Or anybody, by the way, to, um, think for yourself.
[02:28:13.337 --> 02:28:16.199]  Just do what Chat tells you to do.
[02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:18.763]  They're in control.
[02:28:20.945 --> 02:28:22.766]  So, really be stupid.
[02:28:23.687 --> 02:28:25.409]  Just listen to what they have to say.
[02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:29.052]  And, it's the New World Disorder.
[02:28:30.313 --> 02:28:36.858]  Look at the little freaks that have destroyed our freedom.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:39.901]  The little geeky jerks.
[02:28:40.662 --> 02:28:41.742]  The Suckerbergs.
[02:28:42.523 --> 02:28:43.084]  The cooks.
[02:28:44.326 --> 02:28:45.087]  Peechoy.
[02:28:45.467 --> 02:28:46.327]  Google me.
[02:28:46.728 --> 02:28:47.888]  Google me.
[02:28:48.689 --> 02:28:48.909]  Yep.
[02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:51.330]  One after another.
[02:28:53.452 --> 02:28:55.033]  People have lost their passion.
[02:28:57.254 --> 02:28:57.614]  Chat.
[02:28:59.395 --> 02:29:00.956]  Not a drop of passion.
[02:29:02.457 --> 02:29:03.598]  Not an ounce of jive.
[02:29:04.578 --> 02:29:04.818]  Dead.
[02:29:05.719 --> 02:29:05.979]  Dead.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:07.940]  We'll tell you what to do.
[02:29:08.781 --> 02:29:09.481]  And this is real.
[02:29:09.841 --> 02:29:10.622]  It's taking over.
[02:29:13.454 --> 02:29:15.115]  You're looking at the numbers coming out.
[02:29:15.135 --> 02:29:27.721]  They're looking at, I think it was a Goldman Sachs guesstimate, 300 million jobs will be lost around the globe because of AI.
[02:29:28.782 --> 02:29:29.922]  AI, we own you.
[02:29:29.942 --> 02:29:32.744]  So what's the bottom line?
[02:29:33.904 --> 02:29:36.585]  Well, the bottom line is think for yourself.
[02:29:37.886 --> 02:29:39.687]  And that's what InfoWars is giving you.
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:46.122]  It's giving you that information that you're not getting in the mainstream media.
[02:29:48.063 --> 02:29:56.967]  And of course our magazine, the Trends Journal, is giving you trends analysis and trend forecasts that you can't find anywhere else.
[02:29:59.288 --> 02:30:00.289]  So this is serious.
[02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:06.492]  Because this country's going down, the whole world is going down right in front of our eyes.
[02:30:09.011 --> 02:30:09.811]  Fox News.
[02:30:10.472 --> 02:30:22.976]  President Biden told the crowd at Howard University graduation ceremony, quote, white supremacy is the quote, most dangerous terrorist threat the United States faces.
[02:30:24.417 --> 02:30:28.819]  Quote, the harsh reality of racism has long torn us apart.
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:31.900]  Yep.
[02:30:36.662 --> 02:30:36.802]  So.
[02:30:39.591 --> 02:30:42.712]  White supremacy is the most dangerous terrorist threat.
[02:30:44.453 --> 02:30:52.436]  Look at this little, stupid, arrogant jerk shoving crap down your mouth!
[02:30:53.356 --> 02:31:00.839]  How ignorant can you be to suck up the crap that this imbecile spits out?
[02:31:02.919 --> 02:31:04.220]  Shut up, Salenti!
[02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:07.081]  I'm an American coward!
[02:31:09.198 --> 02:31:11.901]  We're full of them up here in Kingston, New York!
[02:31:12.681 --> 02:31:14.904]  We hate you, Solenti!
[02:31:15.404 --> 02:31:16.685]  We hate you!
[02:31:16.705 --> 02:31:18.928]  How come you hate me?
[02:31:20.129 --> 02:31:23.212]  You have peace and freedom rallies.
[02:31:24.093 --> 02:31:26.054]  We support the war in Ukraine.
[02:31:26.455 --> 02:31:31.500]  We're little boys and girls with cojones, little boys smaller than a mortarball.
[02:31:32.518 --> 02:31:36.761]  I couldn't fight our way out of a paper bag, but we love the Ukraine war.
[02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:40.864]  And you, Solenti, are an American patriot.
[02:31:41.964 --> 02:31:44.786]  You believe in the founding fathers.
[02:31:45.527 --> 02:31:46.728]  How dare you?
[02:31:47.568 --> 02:31:52.411]  I believe the crap that they've been shoving my throat, down my throat since kindergarten.
[02:31:54.533 --> 02:31:54.933]  Biden?
[02:31:56.494 --> 02:31:57.775]  Oh, I'm a repulsive kid.
[02:31:58.796 --> 02:32:01.978]  I like, uh, I like Mitch McConnell.
[02:32:03.345 --> 02:32:05.286]  We're more chins than Chinatown.
[02:32:06.066 --> 02:32:08.287]  Oh, I look up to Lindsey Graham.
[02:32:08.628 --> 02:32:10.609]  That's what I look up to.
[02:32:12.850 --> 02:32:18.132]  Look at the freak show right in front of your face, right in front of your face.
[02:32:18.212 --> 02:32:20.413]  So let's go back to Biden's comment.
[02:32:23.395 --> 02:32:31.859]  The harsh reality of racism has long torn us apart and white supremacy is quote, the most dangerous terrorist threat.
[02:32:32.944 --> 02:32:34.465]  The United States faces.
[02:32:34.886 --> 02:32:40.310]  So, look at the little fuck, look at the, I didn't finish the word, I would say face.
[02:32:40.450 --> 02:32:41.511]  Look at the face on that guy.
[02:32:41.971 --> 02:32:44.013]  Look at the little costumes they have on.
[02:32:44.473 --> 02:32:46.535]  Look at these little stupid costumes.
[02:32:47.155 --> 02:32:48.917]  What are you, dressed up in a drag costume?
[02:32:48.937 --> 02:32:49.697]  What is this stuff?
[02:32:50.438 --> 02:32:53.080]  Little, little, little wings on his shoulders over there.
[02:32:54.021 --> 02:32:55.582]  Look at this, look at this.
[02:32:56.583 --> 02:32:58.845]  Little drag, little drag costumes.
[02:32:59.265 --> 02:33:02.179]   They're like that, like that, Prince Charles.
[02:33:02.379 --> 02:33:08.163]  Oh yeah, it was... Look at the way he dressed up with all these... What a freak show.
[02:33:08.563 --> 02:33:11.826]  Anyway, I want you to take a close look at my face.
[02:33:14.368 --> 02:33:17.050]  White supremacy is the most dangerous terrorist threat.
[02:33:17.710 --> 02:33:20.292]  So, I'm a Napolitano.
[02:33:20.732 --> 02:33:21.533]  That's my blood.
[02:33:21.713 --> 02:33:24.535]  My blood is Italian.
[02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:25.636]  My heart's American.
[02:33:26.741 --> 02:33:27.982]  So you see how dark I am?
[02:33:28.022 --> 02:33:29.503]  I've been sitting in the sun a lot.
[02:33:29.884 --> 02:33:31.945]  Cause like, I don't want to be called a white supremacist.
[02:33:32.005 --> 02:33:33.567]  So I'm really darkening up.
[02:33:33.727 --> 02:33:34.307]  So, you know.
[02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:39.171]  What kind of crap?
[02:33:41.193 --> 02:33:42.234]  White supremacists.
[02:33:44.315 --> 02:33:44.916]  Slavery?
[02:33:45.736 --> 02:33:48.579]  Hey, Katson, Biden.
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:51.521]  Where were the slaves coming from?
[02:33:53.423 --> 02:33:53.683]  Africa.
[02:33:55.779 --> 02:33:56.800]  Who's bringing them over?
[02:33:59.641 --> 02:34:00.561]  White supremacists?
[02:34:04.763 --> 02:34:09.346]  How about guys with skin a couple of shades, about five shades darker than me?
[02:34:14.148 --> 02:34:19.511]  Murderers and thieves come in every race, creed, and color.
[02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:23.870]  So shove your crap down your fat mouth!
[02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:30.870]  Oh, there's a war going on in Sudan.
[02:34:31.667 --> 02:34:34.068]  Why, it's those white supremacists, I tells ya!
[02:34:34.908 --> 02:34:37.469]  Oh, how about that war going on in Ethiopia?
[02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:40.711]  Oh, they killed all those Tigres.
[02:34:41.211 --> 02:34:43.252]  Why, it's those white supremacists!
[02:34:44.052 --> 02:34:45.913]  They just look like they're dark!
[02:34:47.714 --> 02:34:52.136]  Look at the imbecilic levels of what in the world has happened.
[02:34:54.136 --> 02:34:55.317]  So, what's the bottom line?
[02:34:56.517 --> 02:35:00.878]   The bottom line is, It's up to you to do something.
[02:35:02.038 --> 02:35:06.639]  I am so sick and tired of people complaining and not doing anything to make it happen.
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:19.561]  And one of the ways you make it happen is by supporting InfoWars.
[02:35:21.162 --> 02:35:31.028]   And the reason being is that their staff, these guys and women, they work so hard To give you the best that they can give you.
[02:35:33.029 --> 02:35:34.269]  So what are you doing in return?
[02:35:37.991 --> 02:35:43.972]  The products Help Info was, that you buy from them, but they also help you.
[02:35:45.873 --> 02:35:50.955]  I'm saying what I'm saying because I'm showing you the facts of the freak show in front of our life.
[02:35:52.115 --> 02:35:55.556]  And if we don't stop it, Jack, you're dead.
[02:35:57.592 --> 02:35:59.393]  World War III has begun.
[02:36:00.713 --> 02:36:02.194]  Elections are coming up in 2024.
[02:36:04.234 --> 02:36:07.636]  As I keep saying, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:36:08.816 --> 02:36:11.517]  And this economy's failing big time.
[02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:13.998]  Big time.
[02:36:17.479 --> 02:36:19.280]  And we're going to be talking a lot more about it.
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:24.014]   Oh, The plantation workers of Slavelandia?
[02:36:24.555 --> 02:36:26.136]  That people call America?
[02:36:26.716 --> 02:36:28.857]  A-M-E-R-I-K-A?
[02:36:28.877 --> 02:36:36.862]  Ah, they only owe a couple of billion dollars more than seven trillion in debt.
[02:36:38.503 --> 02:36:39.303]  Out of hell with them.
[02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:40.684]  What cares about the people?
[02:36:42.105 --> 02:36:43.505]  We gotta bail out the banks.
[02:36:44.546 --> 02:36:45.547]  You're a nobody.
[02:36:46.887 --> 02:36:49.749]  Seventeen trillion dollars plus in debt.
[02:36:52.068 --> 02:37:00.433]  The worst is yet to come and InfoWars is doing everything they can to help you prepare for the worst.
[02:37:01.934 --> 02:37:05.336]  So you do what you can to help InfoWars.
[02:37:07.098 --> 02:37:09.879]  And again, the products help you as well as help them.
[02:37:11.901 --> 02:37:13.442]  So we're going to take a break.
[02:37:13.802 --> 02:37:18.665]  We're going to be back soon to talk about the economy and what in the world is going on.
[02:37:19.699 --> 02:37:21.760]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:27.624]  You know, I was just listening to what Alex was saying about that Ultimate Krill Oil and how it gives him these great dreams.
[02:37:29.385 --> 02:37:31.166]  You know, the kind of dreams that I like to have.
[02:37:32.087 --> 02:37:34.728]  I'm going to be taking some more of that stuff, you know.
[02:37:35.989 --> 02:37:39.311]  Can't say the word now, but I love those dreams.
[02:37:40.231 --> 02:37:41.232]  I'm dreaming of you.
[02:37:41.252 --> 02:37:43.493]  Oh, not allowed to say that.
[02:37:43.694 --> 02:37:44.434]  Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[02:37:46.035 --> 02:37:47.916]  I'm dreaming of it.
[02:37:48.336 --> 02:37:48.476]  It.
[02:37:49.017 --> 02:37:49.177]  Yeah.
[02:37:50.682 --> 02:37:51.262]  Can't be you.
[02:37:51.763 --> 02:37:57.185]  So you want that ultimate krill oil to give you those, uh, those dreams come true.
[02:37:58.325 --> 02:37:58.445]  Ah.
[02:37:59.225 --> 02:37:59.345]  Ah.
[02:37:59.826 --> 02:38:01.046]  I love those dreams.
[02:38:01.126 --> 02:38:02.226]  Just dreaming of you.
[02:38:03.507 --> 02:38:05.908]  So anyway, onto the economy.
[02:38:07.868 --> 02:38:10.529]  And, uh, everything's, I gotta tell you, man.
[02:38:11.810 --> 02:38:13.070]  I can't say I gotta tell you, man.
[02:38:13.090 --> 02:38:19.993]  I gotta, I gotta tell you, uh, it, it, it, them, uh, he, me, his, her, uh, it, that.
[02:38:21.584 --> 02:38:22.585]  You know, everything.
[02:38:22.665 --> 02:38:24.525]  What a, what a freak show.
[02:38:25.226 --> 02:38:26.967]  What a freak show we're living in.
[02:38:29.928 --> 02:38:33.310]  The garbage that they keep putting out, spewing out.
[02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:35.831]  One day after another.
[02:38:36.491 --> 02:38:39.653]  You know, I put out a magazine, as you all know, the Trends Journal.
[02:38:40.453 --> 02:38:43.095]  And what we do, like I could show you.
[02:38:44.195 --> 02:38:49.338]  You see, we outlined important salient points of articles.
[02:38:49.458 --> 02:38:52.347]   So, You see all these articles here.
[02:38:52.387 --> 02:39:01.033]  These are all underlined and, you know, and I'm just showing you, they're all, all printouts, right?
[02:39:02.814 --> 02:39:12.341]  And the reason being is that, you know, like here's one from the Wall Street Journal, but most of them are prints out, printouts.
[02:39:12.782 --> 02:39:17.305]  I get every day, I get the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times delivered.
[02:39:18.786 --> 02:39:20.127]  The papers are that thin now.
[02:39:21.266 --> 02:39:25.408]  I'm showing you these because we have to go all around the world to find trend-worthy articles.
[02:39:26.568 --> 02:39:27.928]  Because it's gone.
[02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:29.729]  Journalism is dead.
[02:39:30.609 --> 02:39:30.850]  Dead.
[02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:40.773]  What happened... Tracking trends is an understanding of where we are and how we got here to see where we're going.
[02:39:42.174 --> 02:39:51.637]   So, many of you are a lot younger than me and you might not remember The beginning of the internet revolution.
[02:39:53.478 --> 02:39:55.339]  It happened in the early 90s.
[02:39:56.339 --> 02:39:57.660]  Really started taking off around 93, 94.
[02:40:02.462 --> 02:40:08.344]  And all of the stupid newspapers, the whole thing about the internet back then, now we have censorship, right?
[02:40:09.292 --> 02:40:12.113]  When the internet revolution began, it was about freedom.
[02:40:12.133 --> 02:40:13.213]  It was about freedom.
[02:40:13.753 --> 02:40:14.633]  Global freedom.
[02:40:14.653 --> 02:40:18.974]  For anybody to say and do anything they wanted on the internet.
[02:40:19.314 --> 02:40:20.235]  That was the beginning of it.
[02:40:21.235 --> 02:40:23.816]  And of course, you know, it's changed.
[02:40:24.296 --> 02:40:27.196]  As I say, the King James Bible got it wrong.
[02:40:27.756 --> 02:40:28.677]  They misspelt it.
[02:40:28.717 --> 02:40:30.637]  They said the meek shall inherit the earth.
[02:40:31.357 --> 02:40:33.298]  The geeks have inherited the earth.
[02:40:34.938 --> 02:40:47.108]   So, what happened was, all the newspapers One after another started putting up their information on the internet for free.
[02:40:48.129 --> 02:40:48.569]  For free.
[02:40:50.090 --> 02:40:55.074]  So why should I pay for a subscription to a newspaper when I could go online to get it free?
[02:40:56.695 --> 02:40:59.697]  That was the beginning of the death of journalism.
[02:41:01.299 --> 02:41:14.006]   When I was a young guy many, many, many years ago, and I was in college many, many years ago, Which, by the way, I only went to to beat the draft during the Vietnam War.
[02:41:16.687 --> 02:41:24.448]  And, to make it clear, as a young guy, young kid, I believe the crap that they were spewing out.
[02:41:25.708 --> 02:41:30.149]  That if we don't stop those communes in Vietnam, those dominoes are going to keep falling.
[02:41:30.989 --> 02:41:34.410]  And before you know it, they're going to hit the shores of California.
[02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:35.250]  Hell yeah!
[02:41:35.610 --> 02:41:36.171]  I believed it.
[02:41:37.511 --> 02:41:48.183]   But, you know, I'm seeing these guys walking up water this deep with guns over their head and 50 pounds of knapsacks on their back.
[02:41:48.203 --> 02:41:50.044]  And I said, I'm not going to go there.
[02:41:50.084 --> 02:41:51.124]  I don't want to get shot at.
[02:41:51.144 --> 02:41:53.325]  That's the only reason I went to college.
[02:41:56.347 --> 02:41:57.707]  So I'm not lying.
[02:41:57.747 --> 02:41:58.688]  I'm telling you the truth.
[02:42:00.709 --> 02:42:07.152]  So anyway, back then, and they're coming out with Seymour Hersh.
[02:42:08.135 --> 02:42:11.577]  About the My Lie Massacre and on and on about what was going on.
[02:42:11.617 --> 02:42:13.518]  And journalism was a great thing.
[02:42:14.619 --> 02:42:19.502]  So many of the people in school at that time wanted to become journalists.
[02:42:21.082 --> 02:42:32.489]  They admired the fact that the press was there to put out information and for the people to think for themselves.
[02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:34.650]  Not anymore.
[02:42:36.211 --> 02:42:37.472]  Now they're prostitutes.
[02:42:38.413 --> 02:42:43.737]  They're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[02:42:45.618 --> 02:42:46.779]  Little pieces of nothing.
[02:42:49.081 --> 02:42:55.666]  So going back to where we are, where we're going, and what needs to be done.
[02:42:59.348 --> 02:43:00.709]  Journalism is dead.
[02:43:03.531 --> 02:43:05.793]  The big corporations bought up everybody.
[02:43:06.587 --> 02:43:08.308]  The newspapers are this thin.
[02:43:09.449 --> 02:43:14.212]  Every newspaper you go to, they got the same front page stories and a couple little crap behind it.
[02:43:16.253 --> 02:43:17.354]  Why am I mentioning this?
[02:43:19.175 --> 02:43:27.521]  Because it's hard to get information that will help you prepare, prevail and prosper in the future.
[02:43:28.281 --> 02:43:30.843]  Once upon a time, there were bureaus.
[02:43:33.806 --> 02:43:45.732]  All the newspapers, all the radio stations, the TV stations, at the state houses, at the local city governments, gone, gone.
[02:43:46.713 --> 02:43:47.774]  The big zone, everything.
[02:43:48.134 --> 02:43:58.119]  And again, it happened when they began giving their information out for free during the internet revolution back in the early nineties.
[02:43:59.747 --> 02:44:08.014]  I'm mentioning this because InfoWars is doing what they can to put out information that you can use that's going to help you.
[02:44:08.534 --> 02:44:09.835]  I go to InfoWars every day.
[02:44:10.275 --> 02:44:11.256]  What stories are they covering?
[02:44:11.296 --> 02:44:12.297]  What articles are they covering?
[02:44:12.637 --> 02:44:14.118]  Oh yeah, I didn't see this one before.
[02:44:14.419 --> 02:44:15.019]  Oh yeah, this is good.
[02:44:15.059 --> 02:44:15.860]  Let me look at that one.
[02:44:18.702 --> 02:44:28.590]  And then what we do in a trends journal, what we do is we give you the articles that are being reported and then we give you our trends analysis.
[02:44:30.589 --> 02:44:34.891]  Of what it means, trend-wise, and where it's going, trend forecasts.
[02:44:37.352 --> 02:44:46.395]  And unlike the chat world, where we think for you, don't think for yourself, the motto of the Trends Journal magazine is think for yourself.
[02:44:47.395 --> 02:44:52.637]  This is what's going on, this is the way we see it, and this is where we see it going.
[02:44:55.859 --> 02:45:00.702]   We gave you the facts, We gave you the analysis, we gave you the forecast, do what you want.
[02:45:03.323 --> 02:45:07.724]  But we'll put our track record up against anybody in the world.
[02:45:08.444 --> 02:45:09.304]  No one comes close.
[02:45:10.064 --> 02:45:14.926]  Show me your books, show me your magazines, show me your forecasts, and then we can start talking.
[02:45:16.246 --> 02:45:17.946]  So again, the bottom line is you.
[02:45:19.687 --> 02:45:23.748]  To do what you can to support those who are doing everything they can to support you.
[02:45:25.308 --> 02:45:27.169]  Put your money where your heart and mind are.
[02:45:29.776 --> 02:45:36.860]  Again, the products that we're giving you at the Trends Journal and InfoWars are giving you for your body and spirit.
[02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:38.901]  Can't find anywhere else.
[02:45:40.782 --> 02:45:43.683]  And if you don't support us, we'll be gone.
[02:45:44.543 --> 02:45:45.004]  See you soon.
[02:45:45.044 --> 02:45:45.764]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:46.825 --> 02:45:49.086]  Hey, great being on InfoWars.
[02:45:49.526 --> 02:45:52.247]  And again, you know, I'm telling you, I'm not BSing.
[02:45:52.828 --> 02:45:54.549]  You know, I don't do that stuff.
[02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:56.049]  Never, never.
[02:45:56.109 --> 02:45:59.391]  Yeah, I mean, I pulled a lot of stuff in my life, but I'm not a BSer.
[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:01.481]  I say it like it is.
[02:46:02.421 --> 02:46:10.504]  And when I'm saying to you to support InfoWars because of what they're giving you and what we're giving you in the Trends Journal, you know, the facts are there.
[02:46:11.084 --> 02:46:12.925]  This is today's Wall Street Journal.
[02:46:13.445 --> 02:46:13.745]  I pay $5.
[02:46:14.566 --> 02:46:16.867]  $5 I gotta pay for this, right?
[02:46:17.027 --> 02:46:17.447]  Here it is.
[02:46:19.488 --> 02:46:20.208]  Big story.
[02:46:21.008 --> 02:46:21.208]  Right?
[02:46:21.829 --> 02:46:22.269]  See it over here?
[02:46:26.130 --> 02:46:27.871]  Bob Lee's divided life.
[02:46:29.375 --> 02:46:32.137]  Technology, sex, and drugs.
[02:46:33.918 --> 02:46:43.438]   Cash App founder fatally stabbed had revealed an upscale party scene.
[02:46:43.438 --> 02:46:53.118]  What do I care?
[02:46:53.373 --> 02:46:54.894]  Why is this a- WHAT?!
[02:46:56.415 --> 02:46:58.397]  SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH, CELENTI!
[02:46:59.952 --> 02:47:04.313]  This guy, he was, he was a Cash App founder.
[02:47:05.573 --> 02:47:07.194]  He is important.
[02:47:07.914 --> 02:47:10.094]  He was a Cash App founder.
[02:47:10.894 --> 02:47:17.316]  You should know who he went to bed with, what drugs he took, and what kind of problems he had.
[02:47:17.336 --> 02:47:30.575]   You, Solenti, all you do is put out a magazine, you know, that gives people important information that could help them Prepare for the future.
[02:47:32.817 --> 02:47:33.757]  And InfoWars?
[02:47:33.838 --> 02:47:35.099]  Why go there?
[02:47:35.119 --> 02:47:39.982]  They only talk about the important current events that are affecting your life.
[02:47:41.324 --> 02:47:44.746]  Five dollars a day for this crap.
[02:47:47.428 --> 02:47:49.850]  How is this helping me?
[02:47:52.753 --> 02:47:55.795]  One useless story after another.
[02:47:56.376 --> 02:47:57.216]  Not making it up.
[02:47:57.837 --> 02:47:57.917]  Oh.
[02:47:58.726 --> 02:48:02.709]  Go on, I think it was Yahoo or CNN.
[02:48:03.390 --> 02:48:04.250]  I just took a break.
[02:48:04.351 --> 02:48:05.852]  Want to see what the markets are doing?
[02:48:07.253 --> 02:48:08.854]  This is the big story that came out.
[02:48:10.936 --> 02:48:18.762]  Cash app founder Bob Lee was having an affair with the sister of his alleged killer.
[02:48:21.304 --> 02:48:22.705]  Friends say.
[02:48:23.626 --> 02:48:24.106]  Friends?
[02:48:25.748 --> 02:48:27.289]  What kind of friend you talking about?
[02:48:29.054 --> 02:48:31.855]  What do I care about this?
[02:48:32.835 --> 02:48:34.656]  How is this helping me?
[02:48:38.397 --> 02:48:38.717]  Yeah.
[02:48:41.058 --> 02:48:42.698]  Four dollars a day.
[02:48:43.919 --> 02:48:45.359]  Four dollars a day.
[02:48:45.379 --> 02:48:50.501]  For the New York Slime, or New York Times.
[02:48:52.001 --> 02:48:55.582]  They call themselves the paper of record.
[02:48:56.302 --> 02:48:58.603]  Or as I say, the toilet paper of record.
[02:48:59.821 --> 02:49:02.662]  This is the business section of today.
[02:49:02.682 --> 02:49:09.003]  The grand total of eight pages.
[02:49:10.643 --> 02:49:15.845]  Look at this stupid, stupid crap here that tells me about nothing.
[02:49:17.145 --> 02:49:19.325]  A guy holding up something over here.
[02:49:20.366 --> 02:49:21.646]  This is eight pages.
[02:49:21.706 --> 02:49:22.926]  That's one page dead.
[02:49:23.746 --> 02:49:24.847]  That's the back page.
[02:49:24.907 --> 02:49:26.227]  How about another page dead?
[02:49:27.458 --> 02:49:29.899]  The biggest ideas inspire new ones.
[02:49:30.459 --> 02:49:33.540]  What the hell are you talking about, the biggest ideas?
[02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:35.841]  Oh, from the biggest freaks?
[02:49:36.941 --> 02:49:38.861]  Oh, what did Musk say today?
[02:49:38.881 --> 02:49:40.882]  I gotta know what Bezos said.
[02:49:41.142 --> 02:49:42.703]  Oh, they're the biggest ideas.
[02:49:43.203 --> 02:49:44.623]  How about Zuckerberg?
[02:49:44.643 --> 02:49:46.724]  All right?
[02:49:46.984 --> 02:49:47.644]  Yeah, look.
[02:49:49.965 --> 02:49:55.724]  Look at this.
[02:49:55.724 --> 02:50:02.165]   Two creative titans share a deep thought, faith in being authentic.
[02:50:02.753 --> 02:50:09.096]  Look at these stupid little pictures so they don't have any writing because they don't have journalists.
[02:50:09.817 --> 02:50:12.318]  And who the hell are these titans?
[02:50:13.279 --> 02:50:14.379]  What titans?
[02:50:15.460 --> 02:50:17.141]  I gotta tighten this up, man.
[02:50:21.463 --> 02:50:21.964]  Titans.
[02:50:24.085 --> 02:50:24.385]  Look at this.
[02:50:25.270 --> 02:50:25.550]  All right?
[02:50:26.551 --> 02:50:27.591]  Remember, eight pages.
[02:50:27.771 --> 02:50:29.792]  Oh, how about this for another wasted page?
[02:50:33.714 --> 02:50:35.294]  Staple's Business Advantage.
[02:50:35.374 --> 02:50:40.377]  Call 1-884-4AUMAN to connect with real intelligence.
[02:50:40.817 --> 02:50:47.940]  Real intelligence by morons that get paid next to nothing at the plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:50.421]  Yeah.
[02:50:50.461 --> 02:50:52.082]  Look at this.
[02:50:52.162 --> 02:50:53.442]  This is what they call news.
[02:50:53.462 --> 02:50:54.803]  Look at all these stupid pictures.
[02:50:55.839 --> 02:50:56.319]  Of nothing.
[02:51:00.981 --> 02:51:01.261]  All right.
[02:51:02.821 --> 02:51:03.161]  That's it.
[02:51:04.262 --> 02:51:05.242]  Four dollars.
[02:51:05.422 --> 02:51:05.702]  So.
[02:51:07.362 --> 02:51:10.243]  Oh, by the way, I just gave you nine dollars.
[02:51:10.483 --> 02:51:12.424]  Five dollars for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:51:13.024 --> 02:51:13.344]  Nothing.
[02:51:13.784 --> 02:51:14.104]  Nothing.
[02:51:14.585 --> 02:51:22.727]  Not one article from either of the Wall Street Journal or New York Times today that was trend worthy.
[02:51:23.399 --> 02:51:30.784]  The only article we talked about was how the bigs got bigger and one of the gold companies just bought up another gold company.
[02:51:31.305 --> 02:51:31.765]  That was it.
[02:51:33.866 --> 02:51:31.765]  $9.
[02:51:35.007 --> 02:51:39.270]  So $9, what could you buy at InfoWars that'll help you and help InfoWars?
[02:51:40.911 --> 02:51:44.594]  And $9, huh, I'm not good at math.
[02:51:44.614 --> 02:51:47.016]  What is that, a month of the Trends Journal?
[02:51:47.096 --> 02:51:47.336]  It's $2.86 a week.
[02:51:47.155 --> 02:51:51.155]  $2.86 a week.
[02:51:51.155 --> 02:51:55.155]  $9 for one day of crap.
[02:51:55.155 --> 02:51:57.155]  Stupid.
[02:51:56.652 --> 02:51:58.073]  Again, I'm not making this stuff up.
[02:51:58.253 --> 02:51:59.354]  It's right there in front of your eyes.
[02:52:00.715 --> 02:52:02.196]  Stupidity for all to see.
[02:52:03.096 --> 02:52:05.818]  This is how a low America's fought failed.
[02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:08.060]  Yep.
[02:52:09.761 --> 02:52:09.981]  Yep.
[02:52:13.944 --> 02:52:14.764]  Yep, nothing here.
[02:52:17.666 --> 02:52:20.969]  Advances made in talks, Yellen says.
[02:52:20.828 --> 02:52:24.308]  As well as yelling, yelling it well, it must be an advance.
[02:52:24.308 --> 02:52:33.188]  Top Philadelphia candidates focus on crime.
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:34.921]  Ooooo!
[02:52:35.421 --> 02:52:36.541]  Ooooo!
[02:52:37.542 --> 02:52:38.502]  Here, here.
[02:52:39.042 --> 02:52:40.103]  Big picture of nothing.
[02:52:41.823 --> 02:52:42.904]  Five hours a day.
[02:52:43.744 --> 02:52:45.284]  So what are you giving to Infowars?
[02:52:46.565 --> 02:52:48.005]  So I want to talk about the economy.
[02:52:48.025 --> 02:52:49.946]  Because I'm talking about the Wall Street Journal.
[02:52:51.046 --> 02:52:52.007]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:52:54.688 --> 02:53:01.678]   Middle of June, The Bankster Bandits, that imbeciles and morons call the Federal Reserve.
[02:53:03.159 --> 02:53:14.145]  That piece of scum, Woodrow Wilson, who gave us Federal Income Tax World War I, and the IRS gave us the Central Banksters.
[02:53:16.326 --> 02:53:23.130]  When they meet in mid-June, the word is now they're not going to raise interest rates.
[02:53:25.356 --> 02:53:26.837]  That the recession has begun.
[02:53:26.857 --> 02:53:29.159]  And boy, it has.
[02:53:32.321 --> 02:53:33.201]  What does this mean?
[02:53:34.482 --> 02:53:35.483]  What to invest in?
[02:53:36.724 --> 02:53:38.325]  What will it do to the equity markets?
[02:53:40.706 --> 02:53:41.126]  A lot.
[02:53:42.647 --> 02:53:43.508]  So here's the deal.
[02:53:46.189 --> 02:53:55.399]   When they lower interest rates, you better make the sign of the cross because you're going
[02:53:55.399 --> 02:54:03.629]   to say goodbye to the death of the dollar.
[02:54:03.297 --> 02:54:03.797]  That's right.
[02:54:06.698 --> 02:54:08.518]  It is the end of the dollar.
[02:54:09.639 --> 02:54:12.739]  The only reason the dollar is strong is because interest rates are high.
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:20.961]  Today, Paul Tudor Jones, that big billionaire guy, he said the Fed's not going to raise him.
[02:54:24.124 --> 02:54:26.906]  The lower interest rates go, the deeper the dollar falls.
[02:54:27.986 --> 02:54:31.609]  The deeper the dollar falls, oh, and the higher gold prices go up.
[02:54:32.489 --> 02:54:37.672]  Look at gold prices now for the last number of weeks, above $2,000 an ounce.
[02:54:38.993 --> 02:54:41.575]  Again, I don't give financial advice, I give trend forecasts.
[02:54:43.816 --> 02:54:52.281]  When they stop raising interest rates, we're forecasting gold skyrocketing and silver following.
[02:54:56.158 --> 02:54:58.018]  And the equity markets will go up.
[02:54:59.399 --> 02:55:00.579]  And a lot more is going to happen.
[02:55:01.099 --> 02:55:03.140]  When we get back, we're going to tell you a lot more.
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:06.160]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:06.180 --> 02:55:24.104]  I just want to remind everybody on May 27th, not that far from now, on the Four Corners of Freedom, right up here in Kingston, New York, John and Crown Street, we're having a Peace and Freedom Rally.
[02:55:25.146 --> 02:55:26.547]  Make America healthy again.
[02:55:26.847 --> 02:55:27.868]  That's what it's being called.
[02:55:27.908 --> 02:55:28.949]  Gary Null will be here.
[02:55:28.969 --> 02:55:33.372]  It's making America healthy again, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:55:34.013 --> 02:55:35.414]  And, and you ready for this?
[02:55:36.855 --> 02:55:46.462]   RFK Jr.' 's campaign manager, Dennis Kucinich, is going to be here as one of the speakers, plus others.
[02:55:47.883 --> 02:55:52.507]  So we're doing everything we can to bring peace on Earth, goodwill to all.
[02:55:54.878 --> 02:55:55.319]  R.F.K.
[02:55:55.359 --> 02:55:55.499]  Jr.
[02:55:55.559 --> 02:55:57.401]  is against the war machines.
[02:55:59.043 --> 02:56:01.666]  And, you know, people say, oh, you know, he said something about climate change.
[02:56:01.706 --> 02:56:13.159]  How about as an environmental lawyer, you know, he's trying to stop all those poisons that are being, you know, thrown into everything and every ounce of our body in every way.
[02:56:13.931 --> 02:56:30.376]  And as Alex was just talking about the filters, you know, to filter the water and everything else, you know, so, you know, it's one article after another that we each week, it's been going on now for weeks and weeks in our Trends Journal, we're writing about these forever chemicals.
[02:56:31.036 --> 02:56:32.737]  And this is an article that just came out.
[02:56:33.857 --> 02:56:34.197]  U.S.
[02:56:34.257 --> 02:56:53.273]   food pesticides contaminated with toxic quote forever chemicals testing finds PFAS are present at Potentially dangerous levels in widely used chemicals sprayed on food crops destined for American plates.
[02:56:54.473 --> 02:56:54.653]  Yep.
[02:56:56.234 --> 02:56:57.295]  Again, we've been writing about this.
[02:56:57.335 --> 02:56:58.835]  They're poisoning us in every way.
[02:56:59.496 --> 02:57:09.180]  So I'm mentioning this because what you also want to do when things get really bad is you want to prepare for the worst.
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:10.821]  And the worst is about to come.
[02:57:11.923 --> 02:57:16.406]  As I say, if you prepare for the worst and the worst doesn't happen, you lose nothing.
[02:57:18.047 --> 02:57:25.972]  But if you don't prepare for the worst and the worst happens, you lose everything, including maybe your life.
[02:57:27.393 --> 02:57:37.380]  So, you want to get these storable foods, considering where we're going, and InfoWars has them.
[02:57:38.499 --> 02:57:44.621]  They have high quality, storable food, water, and air supplies.
[02:57:45.721 --> 02:57:49.022]  And they've been out of stock with them, but now they're back in stock.

[02:58:28.664 --> 02:58:35.829]  And again, you also need about clean air inside your home and office.
[02:58:36.863 --> 02:58:54.636]  Because there's so many pollutants with all the products that they have that are sprayed with these forever chemicals and all these other dangerous elements in them that you want to make sure that you have a purification system that's going to have a technology to superior air quality.
[02:58:55.537 --> 02:58:56.358]  And we're going to need it.

[02:59:12.524 --> 02:59:15.665]  There's no magazine in the world that comes close to it.
[02:59:15.705 --> 02:59:17.106]  If you could find it, let me know.
[02:59:17.946 --> 02:59:22.487]  Again, Business Insider just filed, what, fired 10% of its staff.
[02:59:23.348 --> 02:59:27.509]  Oh, Vice just declared bankruptcy.
[02:59:28.869 --> 02:59:30.730]  BuzzFeed's buzzed out.
[02:59:32.751 --> 02:59:36.187]   Vox's In the box?
[02:59:36.888 --> 02:59:37.988]  Ready to get buried?
[02:59:40.069 --> 02:59:40.629]  You know why?
[02:59:40.789 --> 02:59:43.170]  Because they're feeding you the same crap with different language.
[02:59:44.531 --> 03:00:10.403]   There's no magazine, no magazine in the world, any place, anywhere that gives you in-depth trends analysis and trend forecasts of the important socioeconomic and geopolitical trends shaping the future other than what they're giving you The Wall Street Journal about Bob Lee's divided life.
[03:00:13.264 --> 03:00:16.644]  So going on to what's going on in the economy, because it's very important.
[03:00:17.665 --> 03:00:21.225]  The Trends Journal was the first to call the office building bust.
[03:00:21.905 --> 03:00:34.368]  When these little geeky freaks started locking up and telling people to go home, go home, work from home, live from home, don't go out, buy from home, so our businesses could boom.
[03:00:37.267 --> 03:00:40.348]  They destroyed the commercial real estate sector.
[03:00:42.428 --> 03:00:44.048]  It's going down big and hard.
[03:00:44.088 --> 03:00:46.389]  We warned about this three years ago.
[03:00:46.909 --> 03:00:48.769]  It's just making the news now.
[03:00:49.770 --> 03:00:55.131]  Because it's not only the office buildings, which commercial debt is over $5 trillion.
[03:00:56.691 --> 03:01:00.632]  It's all the businesses that depended on commuters that aren't commuting anymore.
[03:01:00.652 --> 03:01:02.672]  That's right.
[03:01:03.232 --> 03:01:06.993]  Foot traffic in the 10 largest cities in America.
[03:01:09.175 --> 03:01:09.755]  Down 25%.
[03:01:09.915 --> 03:01:11.436]  Yeah.
[03:01:13.897 --> 03:01:17.759]  And people going to work, they're not going Monday, not going Friday, they'll go Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[03:01:17.779 --> 03:01:20.300]  It's all the businesses that depended on.
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:25.202]  So here's the, here are the kind of stories that are now coming out.
[03:01:26.702 --> 03:01:28.463]  This is from the Financial Times.
[03:01:29.223 --> 03:01:31.584]  Commercial properties next year to drop for U.S.
[03:01:31.644 --> 03:01:32.044]  lenders.
[03:01:33.825 --> 03:01:34.625]  No kidding.
[03:01:35.186 --> 03:01:36.546]  Blow me away, man.
[03:01:36.746 --> 03:01:38.267]  Never would have known that.
[03:01:39.517 --> 03:01:42.079]  But hey, now that you're saying it, it must be true.
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:46.081]  Fund managers are warning of growing problems.
[03:01:47.602 --> 03:01:48.443]  What did I just say?
[03:01:48.723 --> 03:01:49.563]  Over 5 trillion?
[03:01:51.084 --> 03:01:53.386]  In the 5.6 trillion dollar U.S.
[03:01:53.446 --> 03:02:00.890]  commercial real estate industry, that could prove painful for lenders already shaken by turmoil in the banking sector.
[03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:02.531]  Isn't that nice, sweet language?
[03:02:03.632 --> 03:02:06.554]  Could provide... Could prove painful?
[03:02:07.828 --> 03:02:09.148]  Shaken by turmoil?
[03:02:09.628 --> 03:02:11.009]  You're going broke!
[03:02:11.049 --> 03:02:13.589]  Your life is being destroyed in front of you!
[03:02:13.870 --> 03:02:15.050]  Oh, you're shaken?
[03:02:15.070 --> 03:02:18.591]  You're rockin' and a-reelin', boppin' and a-bop?
[03:02:18.911 --> 03:02:19.851]  You're shaken?
[03:02:20.610 --> 03:02:22.610]  Your life is destroyed.
[03:02:22.610 --> 03:02:30.610]  And interest rates have gone up.
[03:02:31.294 --> 03:02:33.134]  And you got these floating loans.
[03:02:34.194 --> 03:02:39.408]   So now, as you got less tenants, You got to pay more on your mortgage.
[03:02:41.689 --> 03:02:43.410]  And you got a lot less money coming in.
[03:02:43.690 --> 03:02:45.131]  Hey, bank, keep my building.
[03:02:45.211 --> 03:02:45.571]  I can't.
[03:02:46.591 --> 03:02:46.971]  All right.
[03:02:49.072 --> 03:02:49.572]  Yep.
[03:02:49.572 --> 03:02:58.591]  Yep.
[03:02:59.057 --> 03:03:00.638]  Oh, here's one from CNBC.
[03:03:01.178 --> 03:03:01.918]  May 13th.
[03:03:02.499 --> 03:03:03.279]  Not too far ago.
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:13.864]   Many corporate Leaders were hoping that debate over the return for office was over when they implemented mandates for workers.
[03:03:14.905 --> 03:03:24.949]  But the latest data from New York City key office markets suggests that many employees still setting their own terms.
[03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:37.178]   While the average building visits are back above their pre-pandemic baseline, At 61% according to the latest.
[03:03:37.558 --> 03:03:40.119]  The Real Estate Board of New York, the momentum has stalled.
[03:03:40.980 --> 03:03:55.807]  Among its key findings released earlier this month, that visitation rates peaked at 65% in mid-2022.
[03:03:56.947 --> 03:04:01.390]  Office buildings with vacancy rates and utilizations under 50% it says.
[03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:03.210]  Many buildings across the U.S.
[03:04:03.230 --> 03:04:04.331]  are already at that mark.
[03:04:05.256 --> 03:04:06.557]  Yep, they're going broke.
[03:04:07.578 --> 03:04:08.819]  People aren't going back to work.
[03:04:11.961 --> 03:04:13.002]  Now, what does this mean?
[03:04:14.263 --> 03:04:24.811]  Oh, cities get a lot of their tax revenues from what they pay in commercial buildings.
[03:04:26.472 --> 03:04:28.734]  I'm not going to pay any taxes because I'm losing money.
[03:04:30.115 --> 03:04:31.316]  And I don't own the building anymore.
[03:04:32.817 --> 03:04:34.138]  So that's going to bring the cities down.
[03:04:34.798 --> 03:04:38.920]  Oh, by the way, crime rates are going to continue to escalate.
[03:04:40.020 --> 03:04:43.362]  As I say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:04:44.662 --> 03:04:46.203]  So you better prepare for the worst.
[03:04:47.464 --> 03:04:51.486]  And again, InfoWars is helping you prepare with their food and other products.
[03:04:52.046 --> 03:05:07.809]   And we're helping you prepare by suggesting what kind of actions you might want to take To prepare for the worst geopolitical and socioeconomic crisis in world history.
[03:05:08.250 --> 03:05:10.592]  It's out at our doorstep.
[03:05:11.413 --> 03:05:18.179]  And remember, May 27th, Four Corners of Freedom in Kingston, New York, the most historical corners in America.

[03:06:05.466 --> 03:06:12.349]  One thing I could recommend is I think we need to get some of these Gen Zers on TurboForce, which you can get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:12.369 --> 03:06:13.830]  Didn't see the plug coming, did you?

[03:06:49.478 --> 03:06:52.379]  Just some of the ingredients packed into TurboForce.
[03:06:52.379 --> 03:06:53.719]  It's in a powder form.
[03:06:53.719 --> 03:06:54.719]  It's in a canister.
[03:06:54.719 --> 03:06:56.919]  You saw the commercial earlier.
[03:06:56.919 --> 03:06:58.759]  People were fighting over the last little bag.
[03:06:58.759 --> 03:07:01.199]  They don't even know we got it now in a canister.
[03:07:01.199 --> 03:07:04.759]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and pick up your TurboForce.
[03:07:04.759 --> 03:07:06.759]  I don't know what you're waiting for.
[03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:09.242]  And that's my really my only plug today.
[03:07:09.262 --> 03:07:09.923]  I feel bad.
[03:07:09.983 --> 03:07:14.126]  I forgot to do it all throughout because we had so much information going on an amazing interview.
[03:07:14.527 --> 03:07:16.148]  But we got another amazing interview.
[03:07:16.208 --> 03:07:18.730]  Infowarsstore.com and support what we're doing.
[03:07:18.869 --> 03:07:23.989]   It's you out there that fuel the jet engines that keep this whole thing twirling about.
[03:07:23.989 --> 03:07:29.069]  [MUSIC]
[03:07:29.069 --> 03:07:33.349]   It's been said that my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:07:34.052 --> 03:07:36.414]  When Christ said that, we know it's totally true.
[03:07:37.034 --> 03:07:37.775]  Knowledge is power.
[03:07:38.335 --> 03:07:41.197]  It's also been said that God helps those that help themselves.
[03:07:42.258 --> 03:07:46.241]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to help yourself and help your family and help your community.
[03:07:47.341 --> 03:07:52.202]  If you research the iodine conspiracy and discover that in the U.S.
