[00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:14.844]  The official way to immigrate into the United States is very similar to most countries.
[00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:20.148]  File an immigrant petition with the government, and upon approval, apply for a visa.
[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:26.153]  You will then have to maintain a productive status for several years if you want to consider citizenship.
[00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.895]  But there is a new system now in place.
[00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:39.662]  This new system is not official, nor is it legal, and it's being done by thousands of government employees who have sworn an oath to uphold the U.S.
[00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:40.983]  Constitution.
[00:00:40.983 --> 00:00:48.489]  And yet, here they all are, submitting to the United Nations agenda and committing treason.
[00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.494]  On the Mexico side, Mexican immigration officers lead crowds of people to crossing points at the border.
[00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:10.182]  On the American side, government workers wait for the cover of darkness.
[00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:22.351]  And in the middle of the night, federal employees begin processing the large crowd with mobile devices.
[00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.414]  Middle schools are used as processing centers.
[00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:40.641]  Buses are backed in past the media as Border Patrol use government vehicles to try blocking the cameras from filming the migrants being loaded on board and brought into the country.
[00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:51.170]  The migrants are given mobile phones as a digital form of ID, bus tickets, debit cards, and court dates set four years from now.
[00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:58.385]  There are no checks or balances in this new de facto immigration system.
[00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:04.352]  And it's turning thousands of government workers into traitors to their own country.
[00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:06.896]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.562]  Why?
[00:02:31.562 --> 00:02:34.643]  Why would Joe Biden do this?
[00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:41.105]  Why would Joe Biden put the illegal immigrants in cages and concentration camps like this?
[00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:42.085]  Why, Biden?
[00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:46.227]  Why?
[00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:49.548]  Oh, Joe Biden, he's putting the kids in camps.
[00:02:49.548 --> 00:02:51.528]  He's putting the kids in cages.
[00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.607]  This is worse.
[00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:57.208]  This is worse than the Nazis.
[00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:03.710]  Biden, why are you doing this?
[00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.970]  I just can't anymore.
[00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.711]  I just can't.
[00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:09.611]  The heartlessness of Joe Biden.
[00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:15.613]  The heartlessness of Joe Biden to do this to the illegal immigrants and the children.
[00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:17.814]  It's heartless for this process.
[00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:21.435]  Look at this razor wire and a racist wall.
[00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:43.890]  All right, a little satire from our border coverage, the Biden border invasion coverage, a little AOC satire there.
[00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.111]  She did that viral photo shoot.
[00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:54.876]  At a kids-in-cages, Trump's kids-in-cages illegal immigrants facility.
[00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:59.919]  But now that they're in cages with razor wire, she has nothing to say.
[00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.720]  Because it was all an act.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.781]  It was all a fraud.
[00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:07.283]  We got a lot of border news we're obviously going to be covering.
[00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:11.065]  We can go throughout some of the clips from our border coverage as well.
[00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:15.988]  But I'm going to tell you what's really important about this.
[00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.629]  There's two things that are important about this.
[00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:20.494]  And then there's some other news as well.
[00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:25.920]  I do intend to take phone calls tonight.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.966]  Whether you want to talk about the border or some of the other news that I'm going to be talking about as well.
[00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:35.750]  So, it's the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.174]  He is taking this Mother's Day off to be with family.
[00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.673]  But we're glad that you could join us this evening.
[00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:51.161]  So we'll take calls, cover news, and talk about the Biden border invasion.
[00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:56.648]  You have now seen it once again, documented at Bandot Video, unlike anywhere else.
[00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:07.297]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:10.278]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:19.822]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:05:19.822 --> 00:05:21.763]  The number one preventable cause
[00:05:22.483 --> 00:05:33.386]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:05:33.386 --> 00:05:43.309]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.690]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.751]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together
[00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:51.353]  Supercharges your body.
[00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:57.378]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com for being sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:58.679]  X3 back in stock.
[00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:59.740]  Take action now.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.701]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:11.676]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.476]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:15.397]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:17.058]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.058 --> 00:06:18.718]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:23.841]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:28.042]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:36.246]  So just unprecedented scenes and scenarios at the southern border.
[00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:38.907]  Really, since Biden has gotten into office,
[00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:47.895]  But, but because of the media hype around Title 42, it really put the focus down there.
[00:06:47.895 --> 00:07:02.288]  And then we amplified that focus and changed the narrative by exposing Border Patrol, but not just filming it and showing the world, but sitting there and calling it out like it should have been a long time ago.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.784]  Even when we were there in 2021, it was not getting the same amount of media attention.
[00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:18.693]  But you saw all the cameras that were there, and all the footage that they put out had to have my voice behind it, that they probably couldn't stand, could they?
[00:07:18.693 --> 00:07:26.400]  But see, they just want you to see it, and they just want to play it, and say, oh, there's the border, just some B-roll, oh, yep, it's a news headline, oh, yeah, it's a thing, and then just move on.
[00:07:27.475 --> 00:07:28.136]  No.
[00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:29.877]  That's Biden's border invasion.
[00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:31.538]  That's your wide-open southern border.
[00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:33.880]  That's your government lying to you, saying it's secure.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.983]  That's your Border Patrol facilitating and finishing the process and lying to you about it.
[00:07:38.983 --> 00:07:45.708]  That's the Border Patrol pulling up their vehicles to stop you from filming it and seeing it.
[00:07:45.708 --> 00:07:47.169]  You're paying for it all.
[00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:49.130]  You have an open border and a welfare state.
[00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.433]  You're supposed to be paying for a war in Ukraine.
[00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:56.776]  I'm not going to have the time tonight to get into that news, but
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:10.592]  There's been huge news out of Ukraine, and the Western media doesn't even cover it, because it's so embarrassing for Joe Biden and for NATO.
[00:08:10.592 --> 00:08:18.260]  All the weapons they try to get into Ukraine, folks, are just getting blown up.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.721]  They literally just blow them up.
[00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:21.083]  The Russians blow them up.
[00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.650]  And so we keep sending all this money.
[00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.892]  But I'm not going to get into that story and those developments tonight.
[00:08:28.892 --> 00:08:32.815]  Because I want to take calls and focus on the border stuff.
[00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:37.179]  As it's obviously fresh on my mind just being there.
[00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:42.042]  But see, you're just supposed to pay for all of it.
[00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:45.345]  Your taxes go up, your bills go up.
[00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:47.306]  You're just supposed to foot this bill.
[00:08:47.306 --> 00:08:50.249]  You're just supposed to pay for the whole thing.
[00:08:50.249 --> 00:08:50.369]  And
[00:08:52.063 --> 00:09:12.970]  All the history, all the incredible individuals, Americans, in the past, that built this country to be the free, prosperous country that it is, they're just rolling in their graves.
[00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.932]  They're watching the US people now spit on what they built.
[00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.432]  Not even realizing what they're doing.
[00:09:20.432 --> 00:09:24.114]  Not even realizing what they have.
[00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:29.377]  And so, you could be sympathetic or empathetic towards the illegal immigrants coming here.
[00:09:29.377 --> 00:09:30.417]  Sure, they're being tricked.
[00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:31.818]  They're being used.
[00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:33.939]  It's a tool of the globalists.
[00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:38.221]  It's a tool of the UN, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, you name it.
[00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:41.803]  All these NGOs that want to be global government institutions.
[00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:55.078]  The World Economic Forum, the Bilderbergs, who are going to be meeting in a week, I guess less than a week, they're going to be meeting this weekend in Portugal.
[00:09:55.078 --> 00:10:01.242]  It's an economic bomb, is what it is.
[00:10:01.242 --> 00:10:06.405]  It's a culture bomb, it's a demographic bomb, it's a political bomb.
[00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:07.086]  Oh, and by the way,
[00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:15.654]  I haven't even... We've got so much footage from this weekend that you haven't even seen it all.
[00:10:15.654 --> 00:10:17.037]  At the El Paso Airport...
[00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:19.474]  Everywhere you look.
[00:10:19.474 --> 00:10:21.355]  It was just like in McAllen, folks.
[00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:31.998]  Everywhere you look, it's one of the undocumented migrants with their little Manila envelopes that have the directions and the plane tickets, and they have a little Red Cross care package.
[00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.419]  It's easily identifiable.
[00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:35.940]  Again, the Manila envelope and then a Red Cross care package.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.880]  It has Red Cross logo right on the thing.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.321]  And it's just all over the El Paso airport.
[00:10:41.321 --> 00:10:43.442]  Oh, who do you think pays for that?
[00:10:44.893 --> 00:10:48.055]  I'm sure they're paying for that themselves, right?
[00:10:48.055 --> 00:10:54.099]  With their new phones and everything else.
[00:10:54.099 --> 00:10:56.620]  So see, they're just being used.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.622]  They're coming from third world countries.
[00:10:58.622 --> 00:11:01.563]  They're trying to escape their criminal history.
[00:11:01.563 --> 00:11:07.947]  They're falling for the cheese in the trap to come here.
[00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:36.054]  You know, on a personal level, if you can try to relate to this, being down there and watching those openings be a one-way street, it really, it was something that really changed my worldview or perspective drastically.
[00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:49.385]  Because I've never been one that makes these jokes with some level of seriousness, like, oh, you know, they're just turning the United States into an open-air prison camp, the wall's actually going to be built to keep us in and all that stuff, like, okay.
[00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:57.550]  You know, I've got to be honest, that starts going through your head when you realize that's a one-way entry.
[00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.191]  You can come in, but you can't come out.
[00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:02.729]  Once you get in, you ain't getting out.
[00:12:02.729 --> 00:12:06.652]  You, you the American that's in the system, you can't go across that opening.
[00:12:06.652 --> 00:12:14.118]  Only the ones that aren't in the system yet, they can come in.
[00:12:14.118 --> 00:12:17.140]  And I could go on and on with the examples of this.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.785]  With Border Patrol getting uppity and harassing the media just for being there filming on American soil.
[00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:25.146]  We had a bunch of different run-ins with them getting uppity on
[00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.085]  Me and my crew.
[00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:31.568]  Of course, we don't back down.
[00:12:31.568 --> 00:12:35.210]  And that's the big problem is, that's why this whole thing blew open, folks.
[00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:42.836]  Because usually the media just cooperates like lemmings and they just fall for this false security, this color of law.
[00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:56.229]  So, thank goodness me and my crew were there, because even the media that would usually just kind of go along to get along in that situation, even they were like, hey, yeah, why are you black on our cameras here?
[00:12:56.229 --> 00:12:59.191]  I'm like, hey, that guy's right.
[00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:01.253]  You shouldn't be keeping us from filming.
[00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:15.144]  Even individuals out there that celebrate my censorship, like Sebastian Gorka, shared the videos celebrating our work there.
[00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:16.964]  Thank you, Sebastian.
[00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:20.605]  They all come around eventually.
[00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:24.146]  But no, to have that happen... See, I'm not faking this.
[00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:25.827]  This isn't the WWE.
[00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:29.068]  I'm not out there doing a promo video.
[00:13:29.068 --> 00:13:35.530]  I'm an American citizen that's being treated like a second-class citizen, and it couldn't be more obvious right there in front of my face.
[00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:45.756]  I have to jump through a bunch of hoops just to go to cover this because I get politically persecuted.
[00:13:45.756 --> 00:13:56.462]  And then I have to sit there and get treated like a dirty American, get out of the way, the illegal immigrants are here, move.
[00:13:56.462 --> 00:13:59.844]  We are facilitating their entry illegally into the country.
[00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:02.826]  You dirty American need to sit down and shut up.
[00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:06.826]  Oh, do I?
[00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:10.488]  Oh, really?
[00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:13.410]  That little dweeb, you know?
[00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.991]  We're honorable people here.
[00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:17.572]  We have integrity here.
[00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:21.295]  And there was a Border Patrol agent who... He wasn't actually an agent.
[00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:22.655]  I don't want to mischaracterize.
[00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:25.197]  He was a spokesperson, we'll say.
[00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:28.839]  And he and I were talking.
[00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:30.120]  And we were recording it.
[00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:34.880]  And he said, hey, you know, uh, I'd appreciate it if you didn't record this or put that out.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.124]  And you know, I wasn't going to put it out, but then he blatantly lied to my face.
[00:14:40.124 --> 00:14:43.267]  And then he tried to tell me and my team that we couldn't stand there and we couldn't film.
[00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:47.911]  So yeah, I think we're going to put some of that out actually.
[00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:49.873]  And actually we already did in some of those videos.
[00:14:49.873 --> 00:14:49.973]  So.
[00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:55.877]  Yeah, when you come up to us and lie and say, oh no, no, no, there are not buses coming.
[00:14:55.877 --> 00:14:57.118]  Folks, I'm not even kidding you.
[00:14:57.118 --> 00:15:02.983]  They told me twice that day, there are no buses coming into this gate.
[00:15:02.983 --> 00:15:06.446]  There are no buses that are going to be bringing illegal immigrants in.
[00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:09.388]  And then I sat there and watched them do it.
[00:15:09.388 --> 00:15:17.976]  He told me 30 minutes before that happened, that guy right there, 30 minutes before that happened said, nope, there's no buses coming in and out of here.
[00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:21.784]  What the hell is your problem, bro?
[00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:31.994]  See, they're used to the media just, oh, of course, we'll get out of the way.
[00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:34.995]  Yes, yes, you're the authority here.
[00:15:34.995 --> 00:15:38.137]  Oh my gosh, you've got an official Border Patrol shirt.
[00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:40.138]  And I'm a dirty American.
[00:15:40.138 --> 00:15:42.839]  I just need to shut up and let you bring the illegal immigrants in.
[00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:53.564]  I just need to shut up and let Biden's border invasion, the World Economic Forum border invasion, cloud and piven, Great Reset, Agenda 2030 destroy America, I just have to let it happen.
[00:15:54.744 --> 00:15:56.464]  That's the right thing to do.

[00:20:01.062 --> 00:20:06.969]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:19.257 --> 00:20:28.063]  All right, I'm going to get into some of this border news now.
[00:20:28.063 --> 00:20:32.886]  But let's just make one thing perfectly clear.
[00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:38.710]  The Biden border invasion has been active since he's been in the White House.
[00:20:40.936 --> 00:20:48.887]  The focus and the hype around Title 42 caused the focus and the hype to then be on the border and what was going on.
[00:20:48.887 --> 00:20:56.337]  But the truth is there have been a record number of illegal immigrant crossings under Joe Biden's presidency.
[00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.772]  I mean, you pick whatever timeline you want to go with.
[00:21:01.772 --> 00:21:08.297]  Since he's been president for any other president's term, every year, months, he has records for months.
[00:21:08.297 --> 00:21:10.459]  I mean, he's rewritten the record books.
[00:21:10.459 --> 00:21:14.982]  He has rewritten the record books when it comes to the numbers of illegal immigrants.
[00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.685]  So what you saw with
[00:21:20.151 --> 00:21:31.137]  Buses pulling up to the border, getting loaded with undocumented migrants, crossing the border illegally, getting free entry, getting free stuff, and getting a court date for the year 2026, 2027, or 2028.
[00:21:31.137 --> 00:21:39.942]  Just chronologically, building... They've had so many notice to appears handed out, it's gone over three years of a span now.
[00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:46.612]  This has been going on for years.
[00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:49.935]  This has been going on for years.
[00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:59.264]  We documented the exact same things happening when we spent a week in McAllen in 2021.
[00:21:59.264 --> 00:22:03.107]  So, there might be some different procedural things.
[00:22:03.107 --> 00:22:05.809]  There might be some different legal things.
[00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:14.353]  With the expiration of Title 42 and now Title 8, or all the different new legislation kicking in.
[00:22:14.353 --> 00:22:22.082]  But bigger picture, bigger picture is that our border is essentially open.
[00:22:22.082 --> 00:22:26.127]  Anybody who wants to come here seeking asylum or whatever status they can get in with,
[00:22:27.228 --> 00:22:32.372]  Is welcome to and will be brought in, processed, and released.
[00:22:32.372 --> 00:22:39.258]  We have documented this now for three calendar years.
[00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:51.749]  And it's so out of control now, I guess the reason why the Title 42 thing ends up being the big story, the NGOs that are facilitating
[00:22:53.151 --> 00:23:02.098]  The Biden border invasion, we're well aware, Title 42 is going to expire, so that's why they pushed these people to the border and told them, oh, it's expiring, you can get in.
[00:23:02.098 --> 00:23:08.264]  So then when they show up, and Border Patrol says, oh, no, you can't get in, they get all confused, feeling entitled.
[00:23:08.264 --> 00:23:13.728]  They just took this whole journey, and now they're being denied entry when they were told they can get in.
[00:23:13.728 --> 00:23:17.992]  But of course, they don't get denied entry.
[00:23:17.992 --> 00:23:19.413]  And they like to play semantics.
[00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:25.013]  Say, oh no, well, they're asylum seekers.
[00:23:25.013 --> 00:23:29.536]  No, they're here legally.
[00:23:29.536 --> 00:23:32.618]  How many can we take in?
[00:23:32.618 --> 00:23:37.841]  Should we just take in every person who wants to leave their country and start a new life on the face of the earth?
[00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:38.662]  What is the number?
[00:23:38.662 --> 00:23:40.623]  A billion?
[00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:50.910]  But Americans are starting to wake up to this, specifically black communities, like in South Chicago, and they're saying, hey, wait a second, how come we have illegal immigrants overrunning our city
[00:23:52.563 --> 00:23:53.524]  You owe us stuff.
[00:23:53.524 --> 00:23:55.986]  You told us you were going to give us stuff.
[00:23:55.986 --> 00:23:58.228]  Now these people get a higher priority than us.
[00:23:58.228 --> 00:24:00.090]  Oh, bingo, Democrats use you.
[00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.211]  Yeah.
[00:24:01.211 --> 00:24:08.538]  DHS Chief Mayorkas said it is sad and tragic when governors secure their state's borders amid invasion.
[00:24:08.538 --> 00:24:14.444]  He doesn't like that Greg Abbott is interfering with the Biden border invasion.
[00:24:16.024 --> 00:24:19.327]  And there's of course the criminal element that comes with this.
[00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:23.692]  At least seven people shot in Arizona City on US-Mexico border.
[00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:25.734]  Suspect on the loose.
[00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:27.896]  Two people dead at neighborhood gathering.
[00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:33.282]  There was multiple shootings on the Texas border with Mexico.
[00:24:33.282 --> 00:24:36.085]  So that's just the criminal element that comes with the open border.
[00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:44.633]  San Diego border patrol agents arrested Afghan national on the FBI's terror watch list after crossing the border illegally.
[00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:46.894]  Yeah, there's another record for Joe Biden.
[00:24:46.894 --> 00:24:49.696]  Most terrorists arrested at the southern border.
[00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:52.417]  I mean, maybe that's a good thing.
[00:24:52.417 --> 00:24:55.939]  Or is it that they all thought they'd be able to sneak in?
[00:24:55.939 --> 00:24:56.139]  Now.
[00:24:58.695 --> 00:25:01.978]  Most terrorists trying to cross Biden's border.
[00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:06.983]  More terrorists have had to try to cross Biden's border than any other president.
[00:25:06.983 --> 00:25:10.446]  Who knows the ones that aren't getting caught?
[00:25:10.446 --> 00:25:21.195]  El Paso Department of Health warns of community outbreaks of chickenpox, tuberculosis, infestations, STDs due to influx of illegal immigrants.
[00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:22.617]  Yaskabes as well.
[00:25:22.617 --> 00:25:23.838]  These are highly contagious diseases.
[00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:35.410]  Oh, but you, the dirty American, needs to wear a mask and take a vaccine and shut down your business and hide in your home and live in fear over a virus.
[00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:43.513]  But the illegal immigrants coming in with highly contagious diseases are just fine.
[00:25:43.513 --> 00:25:45.094]  That is just fine.
[00:25:46.223 --> 00:25:53.126]  Denver Mayor warns illegal surge could mean cutting services as more than 250 people arrive each day.
[00:25:53.126 --> 00:26:01.389]  Well yeah, and imagine when the green economy kicks in and we've got to get to our carbon neutral status and we can't use a bunch of energy.
[00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:05.511]  Well now you've got a lot more people here needing energy.
[00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:07.072]  We're just going to have to cut service.
[00:26:09.005 --> 00:26:10.946]  Cutting service for the dirty Americans.
[00:26:10.946 --> 00:26:17.711]  Biden-DOJ appeals Florida federal court's ruling that blocks regime from releasing illegals on streets of U.S.
[00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:18.812]  without court notices.
[00:26:21.109 --> 00:26:31.213]  So, in other words, the Biden Department of Justice wants to be able to just release the illegals out into the streets, which their rationale here is, well, we have nowhere else to put them.
[00:26:31.213 --> 00:26:32.413]  Which is true, actually.
[00:26:32.413 --> 00:26:34.654]  They're running out of hotels.
[00:26:34.654 --> 00:26:38.696]  Kamala Harris won't take them into her house, even though Greg Abbott just dropped off another busload.
[00:26:38.696 --> 00:26:39.976]  Kamala Harris refused them.
[00:26:39.976 --> 00:26:42.277]  Kamala Harris is a bigot.
[00:26:42.277 --> 00:26:47.039]  Kamala Harris is a racist, xenophobic bigot.
[00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:47.419]  Bigot.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.682]  Because she refused to take illegal immigrants into her house.
[00:26:52.682 --> 00:26:54.863]  Wow!
[00:26:54.863 --> 00:27:02.807]  Can you believe... Can you believe we've never had a vice president as bigoted as Kamala Harris?
[00:27:02.807 --> 00:27:09.651]  Invites the illegal immigrants in and then shuts the door in their face!
[00:27:09.651 --> 00:27:12.012]  So the Biden DOJ wants to make sure they can just be released on the street.
[00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:19.213]  Four illegal immigrants sue two Republican counties in New York for banning hotels from housing illegals.
[00:27:19.213 --> 00:27:22.716]  So they were taking over the hotels.
[00:27:22.716 --> 00:27:24.437]  The story actually gets worse.
[00:27:24.437 --> 00:27:27.940]  New York boots homeless veterans from hotels to shelter illegal immigrants.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.682]  Yeah, you dirty Americans, you dirty veterans.
[00:27:31.682 --> 00:27:37.967]  New York Hotel cancels 30 rooms Florida couple booked for wedding guests to make room for migrants.
[00:27:39.602 --> 00:27:41.603]  So the Republicans are like, hey, this is ridiculous.
[00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:51.609]  We gotta have an economy for the American people, not just let the illegal immigration pipeline and economy take access away from Americans.
[00:27:51.609 --> 00:27:56.132]  And so Democrat lawyers get involved and they sue those Republican counties.
[00:27:56.132 --> 00:28:00.434]  Arizona border city releases hundreds of unprocessed migrants onto the streets of Yuma.
[00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:03.756]  Yes, and the Biden administration wants to keep that going on.
[00:28:03.756 --> 00:28:06.118]  Now here's the question that it's pretty obvious you asked here.
[00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:08.586]  This is going on in Europe.
[00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:11.526]  UK could see over 1 million migrants this year, report claims.
[00:28:11.526 --> 00:28:19.649]  So, the UK is being overrun with migrants from North Africa, and the US is being overrun with migrants from Central America.
[00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:20.169]  Mostly.
[00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:24.150]  Now, they do come from all over the planet, but it's mostly Central America.
[00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.131]  Not even Mexico, really.
[00:28:25.131 --> 00:28:27.031]  It's just Central America.
[00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:30.332]  So, what is going on with that?
[00:28:30.332 --> 00:28:31.653]  This is clearly an agenda
[00:28:33.164 --> 00:28:40.367]  And if you can't see how this is an economic attack, cultural attack, demographic attack, political attack, then you're just missing the bigger picture.
[00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:41.708]  Because that's exactly what it is.
[00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:49.551]  That's why you have North Africa being migrated to Europe, and Central America being migrated to North America.
[00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:52.532]  They're trying to collapse the West, folks.
[00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:54.993]  They're trying to collapse the West and bring in a global government.
[00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:05.472]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:29:05.472 --> 00:29:08.435]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:14.782]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:17.984]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:29:17.984 --> 00:29:30.894]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:29:31.534 --> 00:29:41.483]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:29:41.483 --> 00:29:43.845]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:29:43.845 --> 00:29:46.907]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together.
[00:29:47.648 --> 00:29:49.509]  ...that supercharges your body.
[00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:52.211]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:55.533]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:56.834]  X3, back in stock.
[00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:57.915]  Take action now.
[00:29:57.915 --> 00:29:59.015]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:59.015 --> 00:30:11.684]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border exposing the cartels and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:13.465]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[00:30:13.465 --> 00:30:15.226]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[00:30:15.606 --> 00:30:18.428]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[00:30:18.428 --> 00:30:20.149]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:22.650]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:27.013]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[00:30:27.013 --> 00:30:32.716]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[00:30:32.716 --> 00:30:37.699]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[00:30:37.699 --> 00:30:40.841]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[00:30:41.802 --> 00:30:50.017]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:54.385]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[00:30:59.278 --> 00:31:02.279]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:07.079]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:12.180]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:18.762]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[00:31:18.762 --> 00:31:23.322]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:31:23.322 --> 00:31:26.483]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[00:31:26.923 --> 00:31:28.584]  You want to go research.
[00:31:28.584 --> 00:31:34.669]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:36.050]  But they're selling out quick.
[00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.731]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[00:31:38.731 --> 00:31:41.954]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[00:31:41.954 --> 00:31:44.295]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[00:31:44.295 --> 00:31:45.096]  It's about to sell out.
[00:31:45.356 --> 00:31:48.398]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:31:48.398 --> 00:31:50.440]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.962]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:31:53.962 --> 00:32:02.708]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.351]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.351 --> 00:32:27.175]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.175 --> 00:32:30.056]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:30.056 --> 00:32:35.759]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:37.539]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:39.060]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.640]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:48.564]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:52.886]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[00:32:52.886 --> 00:32:57.828]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:32:57.828 --> 00:32:58.608]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.235 --> 00:33:05.836]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.836 --> 00:33:18.279]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:20.559]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:23.140]  Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.421]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:31.129 --> 00:33:33.351]  We're going to be taking your calls the rest of the night.
[00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:41.017]  By the way, I've got a programming announcement coming up shortly as well.
[00:33:41.017 --> 00:33:45.480]  Alex Jones has some special stuff in store for you on this Mother's Day.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.222]  We thank you for spending it with us.
[00:33:48.874 --> 00:33:56.260]  I am going to get into some other news stories here, also while taking your calls.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.822]  And I want to give out the number now.
[00:33:57.822 --> 00:33:57.882]  877-789-2539.
[00:33:57.882 --> 00:33:58.542]  877-789-2539.
[00:33:58.542 --> 00:34:02.286]  The border, a big story, but there are other stories as well that we're going to be covering.
[00:34:02.286 --> 00:34:04.307]  Or if there's something you noticed getting
[00:34:17.262 --> 00:34:22.323]  Not enough attention because we're distracted with the border and some of the other news.
[00:34:22.323 --> 00:34:27.465]  You can bring that to the transmission as well.
[00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:31.566]  But man, it had been a minute.
[00:34:31.566 --> 00:34:35.847]  We were trying to think when was the last time I was on the road like that.
[00:34:35.847 --> 00:34:39.768]  And, you know, there's obvious reasons why I haven't been able to travel as much.
[00:34:39.768 --> 00:34:43.889]  There is the political persecution that I'm going through.
[00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.230]  That's what I get for being a member of the press that speaks the truth.
[00:34:47.344 --> 00:34:54.628]  And then of course there is the financial attacks that InfoWars deals with as well.
[00:34:54.628 --> 00:34:57.929]  But it was nice to get back out there.
[00:34:57.929 --> 00:35:06.594]  Sometimes you forget how hard it is when you're out there on the road working 15, 16 hours a day grinding in the elements.
[00:35:06.594 --> 00:35:13.157]  But man oh man, if it wasn't for TurboForcePlus at InfoWarsStore.com, I don't know if it would have been so impactful.
[00:35:14.189 --> 00:35:18.873]  Because you probably noticed, you're like, wow, they're up and they're going on the Jones Show.
[00:35:18.873 --> 00:35:27.942]  They're already filing reports before he's even live and then we're out there past midnight into the wee hours of the night filming and getting reports up late, late into the night as well.
[00:35:29.482 --> 00:35:31.223]  That's how I'm able to have that energy all day.
[00:35:31.223 --> 00:35:32.204]  Turbo Force Plus.
[00:35:32.204 --> 00:35:33.685]  Ten hours of clean energy.
[00:35:33.685 --> 00:35:34.306]  I'm serious.
[00:35:34.306 --> 00:35:35.147]  No energy drinks.
[00:35:35.147 --> 00:35:36.128]  Don't need the energy drinks.
[00:35:36.128 --> 00:35:37.168]  Don't want them.
[00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:40.571]  Just Turbo Force Plus from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:42.553]  Now in a canister.
[00:35:42.553 --> 00:35:43.614]  Used to come in the packets.
[00:35:43.614 --> 00:35:44.935]  Now in a canister.
[00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:46.756]  So you can even decide how much.
[00:35:46.756 --> 00:35:48.878]  If you want a full scoop, half scoop.
[00:35:48.878 --> 00:35:50.019]  That's up to you.
[00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:58.205]  And of course, it's your support at InfoWarsStore.com that makes these trips possible.
[00:35:58.205 --> 00:36:03.469]  But I'm telling you, that was my source of energy.
[00:36:03.469 --> 00:36:07.891]  That was my source of caffeine, certainly, and is my go-to.
[00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:08.832]  TurboForcePlus.
[00:36:08.832 --> 00:36:09.833]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:09.833 --> 00:36:14.676]  Find out what all the rage is about.
[00:36:14.676 --> 00:36:17.818]  Almost every time I open up the phone lines, by the way, people want to talk about this.
[00:36:17.818 --> 00:36:20.519]  It truly is the best energy supplement you're going to find.
[00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:26.214]  And it's 25% off right now in FoeWerthStore.com.
[00:36:26.214 --> 00:36:30.575]  All right, we're getting the phone lines lit up.
[00:36:30.575 --> 00:36:36.897]  I'm going to cover news the rest of this segment, start taking calls in the next.
[00:36:36.897 --> 00:36:42.919]  They really, really love to race bait, don't they?
[00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:45.819]  Now, I do believe this is backfiring.
[00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:51.321]  Obviously, it has its intended effect, and it causes people to be racist and be filled with hate.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.402]  But a lot of people are waking up to it now and saying, hey, wait a second.
[00:36:57.402 --> 00:37:02.964]  We're being intentionally divided by the liars on television, in Hollywood, in government.
[00:37:02.964 --> 00:37:11.247]  They want you to identify with this skin color and think that somebody else that looks different has it out for you.
[00:37:11.247 --> 00:37:19.330]  And we all know the direction this goes, but generally speaking, it's the Democrats and their friends that are doing this.
[00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.091]  And they were at it again.
[00:37:21.482 --> 00:37:26.765]  Joe Biden tells Howard graduates white supremacists are the greatest threat to the country.
[00:37:26.765 --> 00:37:31.048]  So he's speaking at Howard University.
[00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:34.510]  Which is a... I think it's an HBCU.
[00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.692]  I don't know if it actually... Is it classified as a historically black college?
[00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.351]  But that's what it is.
[00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:52.737]  And so he's up there talking to a group of young black Americans and he's saying white people hate you and the biggest threat to your future is white people.
[00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:58.180]  That's what he decides to go with at this graduation speech.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.582]  How sick is that?
[00:38:00.582 --> 00:38:06.666]  How diabolical are his writers for putting that on his teleprompter?
[00:38:12.398 --> 00:38:17.741]  What would you think if you had the honor to address a group of graduates?
[00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:19.182]  What message would you go with?
[00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:23.524]  Would you go with the message of, these people hate you, so vote for my party?
[00:38:23.524 --> 00:38:33.990]  Or would you go with the message of, you've worked really hard to get here, you've done what a lot of people were not able to do, and now you have the entire future in front of you.
[00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:39.053]  You know, something positive, something uplifting, something uniting.
[00:38:40.157 --> 00:38:42.258]  No, Biden goes with divisive.
[00:38:42.258 --> 00:38:45.759]  Biden goes with hate-filled.
[00:38:45.759 --> 00:38:48.841]  Or whoever writes his stuff.
[00:38:48.841 --> 00:38:50.101]  Truly despicable.
[00:38:50.101 --> 00:38:52.922]  Truly disgusting.
[00:38:52.922 --> 00:38:57.904]  And can you even imagine if the roles were reversed?
[00:38:57.904 --> 00:39:02.186]  Can you even imagine if a president say, Obama, Biden, Trump?
[00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:04.487]  But let's say Trump!
[00:39:04.487 --> 00:39:07.248]  Although there are no exclusively white colleges, I guess.
[00:39:10.179 --> 00:39:14.120]  And then they'll say, oh well, the legacy colleges are exclusively white.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:19.542]  No, actually their colleges accurately depict the demographics of the country.
[00:39:19.542 --> 00:39:23.903]  But now because of an affirmative action, they go over what the demographics would be.
[00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:26.884]  So no, that argument doesn't make sense, but that's what they would say.
[00:39:26.884 --> 00:39:34.407]  But imagine if Trump was speaking to a group of white graduates and he said, black supremacists are your biggest threat.
[00:39:34.407 --> 00:39:35.827]  Black supremacists want to keep you down.
[00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:37.628]  Well, they say, oh my gosh, this is like Hitler.
[00:39:37.628 --> 00:39:38.448]  This is like Nazis.
[00:39:40.362 --> 00:39:45.446]  Oh no, but Biden goes and does it in front of black graduates, and that's a good thing.
[00:39:45.446 --> 00:39:51.871]  Well, no, I think black people are starting to get sick of this, and I think black Americans don't want to be a part of this anymore.
[00:39:51.871 --> 00:40:02.239]  Now, sadly, again, the propaganda is effective, and some fall into it, but there's a genuine pushback coming from within those communities now.
[00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:17.947]  Really, I think one of the barometers for this is just the support that Donald Trump is getting from the black community that you have never seen for a Republican in my lifetime.
[00:40:17.947 --> 00:40:20.029]  And that's very real.
[00:40:20.029 --> 00:40:21.110]  That's very real.
[00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.814]  The media doesn't accurately depict that for obvious reasons, but it wasn't just Biden.
[00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:42.629]  There's also Alejandro Mayorkas, DHS Chief Mayorkas says he agrees with Joe Biden that white supremacy is the greatest threat of terrorism in the United States.
[00:40:42.629 --> 00:40:44.349]  Oh, yeah, that's what it is.
[00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:45.789]  That's what is so dangerous.
[00:40:45.789 --> 00:40:49.050]  You go downtown Chicago, downtown East St.
[00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.410]  Louis.
[00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.631]  Got to watch out for those white supremacists.
[00:40:53.631 --> 00:40:54.651]  We all know that.
[00:40:54.651 --> 00:40:54.771]  Yeah.
[00:40:56.499 --> 00:40:59.061]  Yeah, that's what I think about.
[00:40:59.061 --> 00:41:05.928]  Hell, you go out late night in Austin around some parts, you gotta be, have your head on a swivel for those white supremacists.
[00:41:05.928 --> 00:41:07.970]  Be on the lookout for those white supremacists.
[00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.654]  They like to play the knockout game and, you know, yeah, the white supremacists.
[00:41:12.654 --> 00:41:20.121]  Well, no, the greatest threat of terrorism and the biggest hate group in the United States is the Democrat Party, actually, is what that is.
[00:41:22.295 --> 00:41:23.936]  But no, they just keep pushing this narrative.
[00:41:23.936 --> 00:41:32.361]  They keep dividing people because really they're afraid of Americans uniting, of all races, of all colors, creeds, backgrounds, economic situations.
[00:41:32.361 --> 00:41:35.343]  I mean, that's what they're really afraid of.
[00:41:35.343 --> 00:41:44.529]  And is it a coincidence that that Patriot Front group is also out this weekend again with Biden and Mayorkas driving the racial wedge in between the American people?
[00:41:44.529 --> 00:41:48.512]  Is that just a coincidence that that Patriot Front group is out there again?
[00:41:51.431 --> 00:41:59.556]  I mean, look, this is such a weird deal because it just has Fed written all over it.
[00:41:59.556 --> 00:42:05.120]  So, I mean, I would never be involved with something like this.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.962]  I don't want to make any assumptions.
[00:42:07.962 --> 00:42:11.564]  But I think being suspicious of this is pretty smart.
[00:42:13.132 --> 00:42:17.275]  And not wanting to be involved with something like this is probably pretty smart as well.
[00:42:17.275 --> 00:42:26.723]  Whether it is totally Fed-driven or not, it will be infiltrated, just like every other group that tries to start something organically.
[00:42:26.723 --> 00:42:33.728]  Do they always have their flags upside down like that, or are they just trying to gaslight us?
[00:42:33.728 --> 00:42:36.250]  So, is it all a coincidence that that's going on?
[00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:42.333]  Oh look, Biden and Mayorkas are warning us about white supremacists.
[00:42:42.333 --> 00:42:43.954]  Now look at this group of white men.
[00:42:43.954 --> 00:42:45.935]  Oh my goodness, see?
[00:42:45.935 --> 00:42:47.155]  You need to be afraid.
[00:42:47.155 --> 00:42:50.237]  We need to divide the country.
[00:42:50.237 --> 00:42:53.318]  That way we can destroy it.
[00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:54.799]  House divided, we'll fall.
[00:42:54.799 --> 00:42:55.979]  Alright, your calls.
[00:42:55.979 --> 00:42:57.120]  On the other side, don't go anywhere.
[00:42:59.804 --> 00:43:02.385]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:43:02.385 --> 00:43:04.647]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:43:04.647 --> 00:43:06.648]  It will change your life.
[00:43:06.648 --> 00:43:15.392]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:20.715]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:43:20.715 --> 00:43:22.196]  Most iodine in the environment
[00:43:22.896 --> 00:43:26.438]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:43:26.438 --> 00:43:30.899]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:37.982]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:43.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:43:44.565 --> 00:43:46.928]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:43:46.928 --> 00:43:49.170]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.972]  You and your family need it.

[00:43:56.938 --> 00:44:00.042]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:44:00.042 --> 00:44:06.188]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:44:06.929 --> 00:44:15.918]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:44:15.918 --> 00:44:18.781]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:22.085]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:44:22.085 --> 00:44:30.053]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:44:30.593 --> 00:44:35.397]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:44:35.397 --> 00:44:46.925]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:44:46.925 --> 00:44:52.989]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[00:44:59.534 --> 00:45:04.557]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:45:04.557 --> 00:45:06.719]  We made it even stronger.
[00:45:06.719 --> 00:45:10.461]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.

[00:45:16.665 --> 00:45:23.790]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.871]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:38.598]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:45:38.598 --> 00:45:40.600]  It is the super fuel.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.061]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:42.921]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:45:42.921 --> 00:45:43.882]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:45:43.882 --> 00:45:45.063]  They go good with this.
[00:45:45.063 --> 00:45:47.104]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:45:47.822 --> 00:45:49.306]  This is the Boss.
[00:45:49.306 --> 00:45:50.028]  TurboForce.
[00:45:50.028 --> 00:45:51.070]  Back in stock.
[00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.093]  Discounted.

[00:45:53.797 --> 00:45:54.679]  More power.
[00:45:54.679 --> 00:45:55.682]  More strength.
[00:45:55.682 --> 00:45:56.183]  More energy.

[00:47:00.447 --> 00:47:13.895]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:13.895 --> 00:47:18.097]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[00:47:18.097 --> 00:47:22.940]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.302]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:40.774]  California facing $32 billion deficit as Democrats in the state call for $800 billion in reparations.
[00:47:40.774 --> 00:47:41.555]  Whoa!
[00:47:41.555 --> 00:47:44.356]  Where are they going to get that money?
[00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:46.618]  Oh, I guess they didn't think about that, did they?
[00:47:46.618 --> 00:47:49.119]  They don't seem to think about much.
[00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:52.922]  Democrats destroying the country with every waking breath.
[00:47:54.005 --> 00:47:55.826]  They have left in their lungs.
[00:47:55.826 --> 00:47:58.967]  We're taking your phone calls the rest of this evening.
[00:47:58.967 --> 00:48:03.249]  We also got other news and video clips we'll be playing as well.
[00:48:03.249 --> 00:48:06.150]  But we got a lot of calls on the border.
[00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:14.033]  And so what better time and what better way to put a bookend on what was truly, truly historic coverage.
[00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:20.935]  And I give a tip of the cap to the entire team, the entire crew, and the entire audience for making it possible.
[00:48:20.935 --> 00:48:22.156]  And thank God we were there.
[00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:25.232]  Thank God we were there.
[00:48:25.232 --> 00:48:28.273]  And thank God you're here supporting us so that we can be there.
[00:48:28.273 --> 00:48:30.214]  So, let's start.
[00:48:30.214 --> 00:48:32.155]  Order, we're received here.
[00:48:32.155 --> 00:48:36.217]  Jack in Florida, leading us off tonight on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:36.898]  Jack, you're on the air.
[00:48:36.898 --> 00:48:39.479]  Go ahead.
[00:48:39.479 --> 00:48:40.279]  Hello, Roy.
[00:48:40.279 --> 00:48:42.200]  Hello.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:51.825]  Something that worked on stopping this motor invasion about a year ago, about June, I think, of last year, Abbott stopped the traffic
[00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:59.953]  On the border with inspections, slow it down to where it was at a crawl.
[00:48:59.953 --> 00:49:10.117]  And he done that for three or four days and that pretty much put a cramp in the invasion that was going on at the time.
[00:49:10.117 --> 00:49:16.799]  I know they started having to reroute traffic over three California places, but if that was done,
[00:49:17.682 --> 00:49:23.086]  That way Mexico would have to put their troops back on the border to get their roads opened again.
[00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:28.090]  That'd be as good as a 35% tax that Trump put on them.
[00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.251]  Anyway, that's why I was calling.
[00:49:29.251 --> 00:49:30.732]  One other thing, Owen.
[00:49:30.732 --> 00:49:37.377]  Where is everybody at not calling for impeaching Joe Biden?
[00:49:37.377 --> 00:49:46.384]  I mean, MTG supposedly had shovel-ready impeachment on the table, and I ain't heard nothing since they got in office.
[00:49:47.605 --> 00:49:56.348]  You know, let me answer this because it's a complex situation.
[00:49:56.348 --> 00:50:06.072]  Why haven't the Republicans impeached Joe Biden despite the massive evidence of crimes and I mean, the dozens of reasons.
[00:50:06.072 --> 00:50:08.533]  I don't have to sit here and waste the time.
[00:50:08.533 --> 00:50:09.173]  You know it.
[00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:12.094]  So the Republican Party is
[00:50:13.695 --> 00:50:15.336]  Split right now.
[00:50:15.336 --> 00:50:26.961]  And you have the Freedom Caucus Republicans wing of it that is truly America first, understands what we're really up against, understand the true enemies of the country.
[00:50:26.961 --> 00:50:30.903]  For the most part, support Donald Trump, want to get Trump reelected.
[00:50:30.903 --> 00:50:33.244]  And then you've got the establishment rhino neocons.
[00:50:34.505 --> 00:50:38.689]  The Mitch McConnell wing of the party that just want to keep things in D.C.
[00:50:38.689 --> 00:50:39.770]  as they have been.
[00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.992]  Where Kevin McCarthy falls on all this?
[00:50:41.992 --> 00:50:45.896]  It's still debatable, but most likely on the neocom side.
[00:50:45.896 --> 00:50:51.361]  So they can't even get a unification in the Republican Party for impeachment.
[00:50:51.361 --> 00:50:53.744]  And so trying to launch an impeachment without that unification
[00:50:55.049 --> 00:50:55.810]  It's going to be tough.
[00:50:55.810 --> 00:51:05.096]  The other reason, and this might be why they can't get unification, and some Republicans might agree with this reason, or it might just be an excuse, do you really want Kamala Harris?
[00:51:05.096 --> 00:51:08.439]  Do you really want Kamala Harris to be the president?
[00:51:08.439 --> 00:51:11.361]  And I mean, you can answer that for yourself.
[00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:16.504]  Most people would say no, but if you're just as be done, may the heavens fall, then you're going for that anyway.
[00:51:16.504 --> 00:51:19.967]  Now, if the Republicans are actually being strategic,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:36.614]  And I suppose the Freedom Caucus wing of the Republican Party could be doing strategy like this, and it might be a long shot that it's successful, because they don't have the unification, but if they assume they can take over the Republican Party, then maybe they can get it in the future.
[00:51:36.614 --> 00:51:44.682]  And they're thinking long term, and they're thinking, look, impeaching Biden with a year and a half left of his first term,
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.282]  Doesn't really do much for us.
[00:51:48.282 --> 00:51:58.109]  Why don't we just let him run again, let the Democrats rig their primaries for him, and then hit him when it's closer to the election and do damage that way?
[00:51:58.109 --> 00:52:03.733]  So there could be a political strategy being utilized here like that.
[00:52:03.733 --> 00:52:07.055]  But the expose of the crimes
[00:52:11.327 --> 00:52:13.449]  Is certainly not going anywhere.
[00:52:13.449 --> 00:52:15.570]  I mean, here's some of the stories today.
[00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:21.915]  Oversight Chairman James Comer, who's going on Sunday mornings with Maria Bartiromo, I guess like every Sunday now, breaking this news.
[00:52:21.915 --> 00:52:26.558]  She has a huge Sunday show, probably the top Sunday show on cable news.
[00:52:26.558 --> 00:52:28.560]  So they'll probably fire her next.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.282]  Informant on Biden family crimes has gone missing.
[00:52:31.282 --> 00:52:33.583]  FBI won't look into this.
[00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.445]  And this guy's been missing for a while now.
[00:52:37.592 --> 00:52:43.398]  And so he said he was going to come out and testify against the Bidens and then went missing.
[00:52:43.398 --> 00:52:45.240]  And, uh, nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:55.638]  Cash Patel, CIA broke federal law by organizing, sponsoring, and pushing the bogus Hunter Biden laptop petition during 2020 presidential election.
[00:52:55.638 --> 00:52:57.439]  So they got the laptop, they know that's real.
[00:52:57.439 --> 00:52:59.541]  And how they censored that when they knew it was real.
[00:52:59.541 --> 00:53:04.105]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, hints Hunter Biden's sex workers may testify in front of Congress.
[00:53:04.105 --> 00:53:10.691]  He's already going through problems with the mother of his daughter that they've completely excommunicated from the family.
[00:53:12.762 --> 00:53:17.024]  The media can do their best to cover up all the Biden crime family details coming out.
[00:53:17.024 --> 00:53:18.785]  They're not going to be able to do it.
[00:53:18.785 --> 00:53:21.186]  So, but to answer your question, why haven't they impeached?
[00:53:21.186 --> 00:53:29.691]  Well, there is not a unification in the Republican Party, and there might be some political strategy here thinking it's better to wait on that.
[00:53:29.691 --> 00:53:32.792]  Jack, a bit of a long-winded answer there, but I really wanted to lay that out.
[00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:34.193]  I appreciate your call.
[00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:35.133]  We stay in Florida.
[00:53:35.133 --> 00:53:37.054]  It's Darren, though, calling in.
[00:53:37.054 --> 00:53:37.835]  Darren, you're on the air.
[00:53:37.835 --> 00:53:38.815]  Go ahead.
[00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.236]  Hey, good evening, Owen.
[00:53:40.236 --> 00:53:42.377]  I commend you and the crew for doing what you've done.
[00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:43.791]  Thank you.
[00:53:43.791 --> 00:53:44.671]  Great work.
[00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:59.942]  So I just wanted to bring to your attention, and I'm sure you're abreast of this, all these cell phones that the illegals are, immigrants are being handed, they're all going to have propaganda on it driving their
[00:54:02.837 --> 00:54:03.337]  100%.
[00:54:03.337 --> 00:54:07.879]  Let's explain this too, so people understand.
[00:54:07.879 --> 00:54:14.941]  They get these smartphones, and they get push notifications, just like anybody else, they get push notifications sent to them.
[00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:29.427]  So they'll get a push notification about white supremacy, they'll get a push notification about how bad Trump is, or how great Joe Biden is, or how great the Democrats are, and they'll get all this propaganda sent to their phone, not to mention who knows what else they're using to track and trace and use that data.
[00:54:30.305 --> 00:54:32.206]  Right on, man.
[00:54:32.206 --> 00:54:58.995]  I think you should have, when these buses are leaving the gates, at every stop sign and every stop sign you should have www.band.video and www.madmaxworld.tv posted at those stop signs or stoplights so that the people that are coming and crossing over can go to those websites and find out for themselves what's really going on with them, you know, because they're being used as pawns.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:09.672]  Yeah, I don't want to go too deep into, because you can't look back on these things and say, oh, I wish I would have done this or I wish I would have done that.
[00:55:09.672 --> 00:55:15.900]  Armchair quarterbacking, I've learned a long time ago, you're always going to have things you wish you could have done or come up with ideas later.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.523]  That's certainly a great idea.
[00:55:18.523 --> 00:55:18.803]  And look,
[00:55:20.587 --> 00:55:26.410]  I wish that we had unlimited funding, and this is not to say that, hey, the audience hasn't come through.
[00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.110]  You have, folks.
[00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:27.671]  We're still here.
[00:55:27.671 --> 00:55:28.891]  We were able to make the trip.
[00:55:28.891 --> 00:55:33.754]  But I wish we had unlimited funding to go back down there and do all kinds of different stunts.
[00:55:33.754 --> 00:55:37.536]  I mean, we can go down there tomorrow, and these buses will still be coming in.
[00:55:40.706 --> 00:55:42.547]  It's just, it's unreal.
[00:55:42.547 --> 00:55:52.213]  I mean, it is simply unreal that this is happening and that the Border Patrol is not just facilitating it, but helping cover it up as well.
[00:55:52.213 --> 00:55:57.797]  I mean, that is just stunning stuff that we documented and called out there in live time.
[00:55:57.797 --> 00:55:59.598]  So, yeah, there was some other stuff though.
[00:55:59.598 --> 00:56:03.441]  I don't want to pontificate it too much because I got our calls to get to.
[00:56:03.441 --> 00:56:05.682]  Let's go to Phil in Long Island.
[00:56:05.682 --> 00:56:06.663]  Phil, you're on the air.
[00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:07.043]  Go ahead.
[00:56:09.352 --> 00:56:24.453]  Hey Owen, thank you very much for taking my call this evening and first of all I just want to commend you guys on the super job you did down there on the border and I especially like your rant when they were blocking the view of the illegals getting on the bus.
[00:56:26.142 --> 00:56:28.883]  Also, just a couple of quick plugs.
[00:56:28.883 --> 00:56:33.045]  DNA Force, Real Red Pill, Nitric Boost, X3.
[00:56:33.045 --> 00:56:35.086]  I use them all, and they're awesome products.
[00:56:35.086 --> 00:56:38.927]  So, thank you very much, you guys, for providing those for us.
[00:56:38.927 --> 00:56:39.587]  Thank you, Phil.
[00:56:39.587 --> 00:56:42.289]  You made that trip possible.
[00:56:42.289 --> 00:56:43.269]  Alright, very good.
[00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:46.770]  Me and, hopefully, millions of other watchers, right?
[00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:52.993]  So, anyway, you know, something's been bothering me for a long time, and this was a good opportunity to get it out.
[00:56:55.069 --> 00:57:00.233]  The illegals have been coming over the border since the Clinton administration, okay?
[00:57:00.233 --> 00:57:11.720]  And in those days, a little administrative memory here, in those days they were talking about, well, there's probably 10 to 12 illegal, 12 million illegal aliens in the country.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.122]  That was at the end of the Clinton administration and to the Bush administration.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:27.468]  And they kept pushing that same number during the whole Obama administration, even though we know that the border was very porous during those years, and probably didn't really... Well, look, I'm up against a break here, Phil.
[00:57:27.468 --> 00:57:30.671]  I apologize, but I think I know where you're going with this.
[00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:34.573]  The real number of illegal immigrants in the country is probably close to 40 million,
[00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:45.454]  It just has slowly gotten worse and worse and worse, because when you don't secure the border and you don't stop it, that just lets people know, yeah, it's open, come on in.
[00:57:45.454 --> 00:57:48.235]  And when you promote the free stuff, that just causes the cascade.

[01:00:04.961 --> 01:00:07.802]  And now, the tip of the spear.
[01:00:07.802 --> 01:00:11.423]  Leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:00:11.423 --> 01:00:13.724]  It's Owen Troyer.
[01:00:13.724 --> 01:00:19.826]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:32.010]  We're in a place where it's much harder to slow down a man's pace than to do it with him.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.042]  Your job is to follow orders from the Governor of Texas.
[01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:37.403]  Just remember you have to do it.
[01:00:37.403 --> 01:00:38.784]  You guys are our government.
[01:00:38.784 --> 01:00:40.506]  And I know what the orders were put forth.
[01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:42.247]  I know what orders were put out by the Governor.
[01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.468]  Who is your Chief?
[01:00:43.468 --> 01:00:44.689]  He is your Chief.
[01:00:44.689 --> 01:00:46.971]  Your Commander-in-Chief.
[01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:48.392]  You can roll your eyes all you want.
[01:00:48.392 --> 01:00:49.713]  I'm not rolling my eyes.
[01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:54.256]  But you guys don't understand, because you guys are in full-time duty to tell us what an order is.
[01:00:54.256 --> 01:00:56.018]  But the Chief can't give you orders.
[01:00:56.954 --> 01:01:17.397]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:01:18.378 --> 01:01:22.542]  The governor said in order to slow down the influx of illegal immigrants.
[01:01:22.542 --> 01:01:23.843]  You guys aren't doing that.
[01:01:23.843 --> 01:01:26.226]  Where's your pride in following orders, man?
[01:01:26.226 --> 01:01:27.066]  Come on, man.
[01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:31.711]  You're wearing a uniform to say and represent the state of Texas, not Border Patrol.
[01:01:31.711 --> 01:01:33.372]  Have some pride, gentlemen.
[01:01:33.372 --> 01:01:34.553]  The governor spoke.
[01:01:34.553 --> 01:01:35.814]  You need to follow those orders.
[01:01:35.814 --> 01:01:37.576]  Thank you.
[01:01:37.576 --> 01:01:38.377]  That's what we do.
[01:01:41.328 --> 01:01:51.618]  So that was some footage we got of a veteran who was there on the scene talking to Border Patrol and the Texas National Guard about what they're doing and how they're disobeying their orders.
[01:01:51.618 --> 01:01:53.079]  And just telling it like it is, folks.
[01:01:53.079 --> 01:01:54.961]  Look, America's getting sick of this, man.
[01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:59.546]  And this whole, I'm just doing my job thing ain't gonna fly.
[01:01:59.546 --> 01:02:00.226]  Ain't gonna fly.
[01:02:00.226 --> 01:02:01.828]  Because we know where that goes, historically.
[01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:09.145]  So, I understand Border Patrol agents, for the most part, are good people.
[01:02:09.145 --> 01:02:12.249]  Sadly, I have to be honest though, we've now run into some bad ones.
[01:02:12.249 --> 01:02:13.870]  We've now run into some bad eggs.
[01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:16.513]  We've now seen that there are bad eggs with Border Patrol.
[01:02:16.513 --> 01:02:17.675]  And of course, it's a large group.
[01:02:17.675 --> 01:02:20.077]  Most people are good people.
[01:02:20.077 --> 01:02:22.080]  And the Texas National Guard, for the most part,
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:23.540]  I don't
[01:02:45.222 --> 01:02:56.387]  He's explaining, you were sent down here by Governor Abbott to secure the border, you're now facilitating illegal immigrants coming in, and then they get all uppity and say, well no, you just think you're better than us.
[01:02:56.387 --> 01:02:59.568]  Well no, he's just explaining to you how orders and commands work.
[01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:03.109]  And now we're watching you, we're watching you do this!
[01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:06.511]  Which we captured, the illegal immigration pipeline, I had to call it out, here it is.
[01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.492]  I'm not going there.
[01:03:18.492 --> 01:03:21.233]  Okay.
[01:03:21.233 --> 01:03:24.034]  So there's a Border Patrol agent trying to block.
[01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:26.215]  That's Savannah Hernandez filming.
[01:03:26.215 --> 01:03:27.836]  They tried to block her.
[01:03:27.836 --> 01:03:31.138]  By the way, that lady blocked Ted Cruz from filming, too.
[01:03:31.138 --> 01:03:35.260]  That lady on the bottom right, she's the one that tried to block Ted Cruz from filming, a congressman.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.241]  So who do you think you are, woman?
[01:03:37.241 --> 01:03:41.263]  Our agents are trying to do their work.
[01:03:41.263 --> 01:03:44.705]  Yeah, the agents are trying to do their work, which is get illegal immigrants in.
[01:03:45.365 --> 01:03:48.047]  We're supposed to accept it.
[01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:50.229]  This is a law enforcement operation.
[01:03:50.229 --> 01:03:53.391]  A law enforcement operation.
[01:03:53.391 --> 01:03:54.192]  The open border.
[01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:16.032]  And now here come the trucks in to block the media.
[01:04:16.032 --> 01:04:21.519]  So first they tried using Border Patrol agents and Texas National Guard agents to block the media.
[01:04:21.519 --> 01:04:25.525]  That didn't work, because we're free Americans that have a First Amendment right.
[01:04:25.525 --> 01:04:28.148]  So then they tried to run us over with a truck.
[01:04:28.148 --> 01:04:30.672]  And none of us wanted to get hit with a car, so we moved out of the way.
[01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:38.691]  But yeah, I mean, we could have stood and have been run over by a car, and that would have been the good guys, and Democrats would have cheered on Border Patrol then.
[01:04:38.691 --> 01:04:44.333]  So they lie about Border Patrol when they do their job, and then if Border Patrol would have run over one of us in a truck, they would have said, good job!
[01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:46.014]  Just run over those dirty Americans!
[01:04:46.014 --> 01:04:48.595]  Do them like Ashley Babbitt!
[01:04:48.595 --> 01:04:50.135]  More of your calls on the other side of this break.
[01:04:50.135 --> 01:04:55.337]  It's the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show on Band.Video.
[01:05:00.393 --> 01:05:03.828]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:09.891]  I want you all to know something.
[01:05:09.891 --> 01:05:11.833]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:15.395]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:18.498]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:22.761]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:05:22.761 --> 01:05:24.983]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:05:24.983 --> 01:05:28.505]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:05:28.505 --> 01:05:31.948]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:35.089]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:36.109]  Years ago.
[01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:38.190]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:40.190]  Not for a second.
[01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:42.711]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:05:42.711 --> 01:05:45.172]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:48.293]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:49.853]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:05:49.853 --> 01:05:52.934]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:06:01.836 --> 01:06:08.402]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:11.085]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:31.986 --> 01:06:39.431]  Oh yeah, the Democrats are bringing in the illegals, and they expect them to vote Democrat.
[01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:52.140]  And they hit them with all the propaganda on the way up here, and then they get a immediate access into their consciousness, their stream of consciousness, by giving them the cell phone that they then push the propaganda to on their push notifications.
[01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:54.315]  That's how it goes.
[01:06:54.315 --> 01:06:57.458]  And they got all their lawyers there waiting too.
[01:06:57.458 --> 01:07:02.621]  So all the Democrat lawyers are going to be there telling them, Oh, the Republicans are trying to do this and stop you from coming in.
[01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:03.722]  You better vote Democrat.
[01:07:03.722 --> 01:07:06.503]  We'll give you free stuff.
[01:07:06.503 --> 01:07:08.745]  All a giant scam.
[01:07:08.745 --> 01:07:11.347]  They're all commies at the end of the day.
[01:07:11.347 --> 01:07:16.630]  Former aide to AOC, now running the Communist Party of New York.
[01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.591]  Dirty commies.
[01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:19.629]  Dirty commies.
[01:07:19.629 --> 01:07:21.352]  Make communists an insult again.
[01:07:21.352 --> 01:07:26.100]  Democrat congressional staffer thinks his boss is lying about her record.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.404]  Oh yeah, well, reality hits you.
[01:07:28.404 --> 01:07:29.465]  It's Liberal Democrats hard.
[01:07:30.996 --> 01:07:34.657]  I saw a picture from Biden speaking at Howard University.
[01:07:34.657 --> 01:07:38.358]  I don't know if it was real or not, that's why I didn't show it, but I think it was just a meme.
[01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:40.818]  It might have been real, but I think it was just a meme.
[01:07:40.818 --> 01:07:48.540]  But the energy's real, and it was a person holding up his graduation cap, and the message on it was, Joe Biden doesn't care about black people.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.280]  Or it was Democrats don't care about black people, something like that.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.061]  So they're starting to get it.
[01:07:53.061 --> 01:07:56.221]  And I mean, it couldn't be more obvious.
[01:07:56.221 --> 01:07:59.042]  Just look at the areas
[01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:05.112]  That have the highest black population density.
[01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:09.595]  It's all run by Democrats and it's all being run into the ground.
[01:08:09.595 --> 01:08:17.222]  So, I'm not saying Republicans are the answer, but pretty obvious Democrats are the problem.
[01:08:17.222 --> 01:08:21.546]  We go back to the phone lines and Christine is in New Jersey.
[01:08:21.546 --> 01:08:24.428]  Christine, you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.428 --> 01:08:26.210]  Go ahead.
[01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:27.350]  Hi, how are you?
[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:27.911]  Hello, good.
[01:08:27.911 --> 01:08:29.132]  Good.
[01:08:30.658 --> 01:08:40.087]  Yes, so I don't think you touched on this yet, but I don't know if you saw it, but New York Post reported, I'm just trying to pull it up, give me a sec, I just had it.
[01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:47.834]  New York Post reported last night, I saw this last night on Twitter, homeless vets are being booted from New York hotels to make room for migrants.
[01:08:47.834 --> 01:08:50.836]  Yes, we covered that in the first hour.
[01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:53.419]  Yeah, we covered that and basically what's going on is,
[01:08:56.581 --> 01:09:05.504]  You have Democrats suing the Republicans who are making the laws that are trying to block the hotels from booking all the rooms to illegal immigrants.
[01:09:05.504 --> 01:09:08.205]  And look, the hotels are like, this is free money for us.
[01:09:08.205 --> 01:09:10.145]  You know, we don't even have to make sales.
[01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:15.527]  The government comes down here and rents every single room in our hotel, so for them it's like the easiest business ever.
[01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:20.608]  So the Republicans in New York tried to pass legislation blocking them from kicking out people, kicking out veterans.
[01:09:23.232 --> 01:09:40.665]  The Democrat lawyers sued to stop that, but yes, they are kicking out veterans, they are kicking out wedding parties, they're kicking out everybody to make room for these illegals, because of course, if you're the hotel owner, and the government calls you and says, we need these rooms for X amount of time, here's your payment, well what are they going to do?
[01:09:40.665 --> 01:09:44.288]  Of course they're going to kick out the people that they're not making more money off of, sadly.
[01:09:44.288 --> 01:09:45.249]  So, that's what's going on.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:46.840]  Disgusting.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.482]  I'm like sick to my stomach about what's happening at our border and to our country.
[01:09:51.482 --> 01:09:53.643]  No, we're now a second class citizen.
[01:09:53.643 --> 01:09:57.465]  Illegal immigrants now have all the rights, all the access.
[01:09:57.465 --> 01:09:59.206]  And look, it sounds counterintuitive.
[01:09:59.206 --> 01:09:59.746]  I understand.
[01:09:59.746 --> 01:10:02.948]  I understand the liberals listening to this.
[01:10:02.948 --> 01:10:04.508]  Like that liberal woman that was out there.
[01:10:04.508 --> 01:10:07.630]  There was a video, you may have seen it, of this debate that happened between me and this liberal.
[01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.271]  It happened live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:11.972]  We put the HD footage up, the banned out video, on a second camera that was running.
[01:10:12.592 --> 01:10:18.633]  Like, I get it, it's very counterintuitive, and complex situations are really tough for liberals.
[01:10:18.633 --> 01:10:21.734]  And most situations are complex, so this is why they struggle so much.
[01:10:21.734 --> 01:10:23.235]  So I get it, it's counterintuitive.
[01:10:23.235 --> 01:10:32.297]  You see these people coming in, they're homeless, they look like they have no prospects or nothing, and so you feel bad, and you say, well look, they should come here and get free stuff.
[01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:33.157]  We feel bad for them.
[01:10:33.877 --> 01:10:35.637]  But that's not what's going on here.
[01:10:35.637 --> 01:10:47.099]  This is a direct attack on the United States, and you're now putting American citizens as second-class citizens, forcing them to pay for all of this, and destroy their own prosperity.
[01:10:47.099 --> 01:10:47.959]  But they don't get that.
[01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:52.020]  They just see a poor, illegal immigrant that they just feel, oh, someone should help this person.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.620]  Not them, of course, though.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.941]  Not them.
[01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:56.961]  They have tunnel vision.
[01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.002]  They have tunnel vision with everything.
[01:11:00.002 --> 01:11:02.122]  Everything that they do is tunnel vision.
[01:11:02.122 --> 01:11:02.462]  That's it.
[01:11:03.331 --> 01:11:04.552]  So, yeah.
[01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.934]  But anyway, I just wanted to let you know about that.
[01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:08.615]  I figured you probably covered it.
[01:11:08.615 --> 01:11:18.284]  I tuned in late, so... No, it is absolutely outrageous, because I did just cover it, but you know, I didn't get too upset about it, because it's just, I'm supposed to be accepting it.
[01:11:18.284 --> 01:11:19.645]  It's supposed to be normal!
[01:11:19.645 --> 01:11:21.066]  The American veteran!
[01:11:21.066 --> 01:11:23.448]  You're a dirtbag American!
[01:11:23.448 --> 01:11:25.309]  The illegal immigrant is more important than you!
[01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:29.213]  So yeah, no, we should be celebrating.
[01:11:29.213 --> 01:11:33.396]  Thank God the Democrats kicked out those veterans from the hotels.
[01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:37.179]  Get those dirty American veterans out of there and get the illegal immigrants in there.
[01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:38.881]  They're the ones that deserve that hotel.
[01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:41.063]  They're the ones that deserve all of our stuff.
[01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:42.344]  Not the veteran.
[01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:44.265]  Get the veteran out of here.
[01:11:44.265 --> 01:11:45.747]  Come on.
[01:11:45.747 --> 01:11:48.089]  Alright, Christine, thank you for your call.
[01:11:48.089 --> 01:11:49.170]  Thank you for bringing that back up.
[01:11:50.464 --> 01:11:52.205]  See, even, I mean, we have the sense of urgency.
[01:11:52.205 --> 01:11:53.726]  We have the passion.
[01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:58.970]  And even I can just sit here, just, oh, oh, oh, they're kicking veterans out of hotels for illegal immigrants.
[01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:00.411]  Oh, okay.
[01:12:00.411 --> 01:12:03.533]  Let's go to Nathan in Knoxville.
[01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:04.313]  Nathan, you're on the air.
[01:12:04.313 --> 01:12:06.415]  Go ahead.
[01:12:06.415 --> 01:12:08.256]  Hey, uh, oh, it's good to talk to you again.
[01:12:08.256 --> 01:12:13.059]  And as a combat veteran, that makes me absolutely sick and mad and everything else, you know?
[01:12:13.059 --> 01:12:15.300]  Yeah, well, that's understandable.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.001]  Yeah.
[01:12:16.001 --> 01:12:17.442]  Hey, you know, I've just been trying to consider,
[01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:19.292]  We're good to go.
[01:12:41.272 --> 01:12:52.177]  Whatever organizations or companies, whether it's Apple or whoever, that are providing these care packages to the illegal immigrants at the border.
[01:12:52.177 --> 01:12:56.779]  If all of the phones are Apple, for example, and I don't know if they are or not, or whoever it is, we need to know that.
[01:12:56.779 --> 01:12:59.621]  So this is an interesting question about the phones.
[01:12:59.621 --> 01:13:05.724]  It appears to me, just from my observation, there is no consistent
[01:13:08.005 --> 01:13:09.546]  There's no single phone that they all have.
[01:13:09.546 --> 01:13:11.487]  They all seem to have different phones.
[01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:20.252]  So I don't know if these are like refurbished phones or phones that they're just picking up for cheap or something to get into their hands or something like that.
[01:13:20.252 --> 01:13:27.557]  Or maybe they're bringing in their own phones, but their phones go through processing and so when they get their manila envelope from the government, their phone is back in it.
[01:13:28.417 --> 01:13:35.681]  We do know some of them are getting phones because that's the only way they can get them through because they have an app that they use now.
[01:13:35.681 --> 01:13:37.642]  There's a government app to help facilitate this whole thing.
[01:13:37.642 --> 01:13:39.243]  So they have to give them a phone.
[01:13:39.243 --> 01:13:48.308]  So I think that some of them probably have their own phones and then they probably also have refurbished phones that they're giving to people that don't have phones because they have to get that app on them.
[01:13:49.608 --> 01:13:51.809]  Here's some news on this.
[01:13:51.809 --> 01:13:54.510]  Illegal immigrants get free smartphones paid for by U.S.
[01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:55.310]  taxpayers.
[01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:56.511]  Some do not have court dates until 2035.
[01:13:56.511 --> 01:13:56.911]  So I'm seeing 2035.
[01:13:56.911 --> 01:13:57.831]  I was up to 2028.
[01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:59.332]  But yeah, that just shows the influx, Nathan.
[01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:04.768]  Right.
[01:14:04.768 --> 01:14:11.013]  Well, I just wanted to bring attention to that because we do need to be paying attention if there's any individuals or organizations that are funding this.
[01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:13.334]  Well, it's the American Red Cross.
[01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:13.835]  Absolutely.
[01:14:13.835 --> 01:14:15.075]  It's the American Red Cross.
[01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:16.897]  It's UNICEF.
[01:14:16.897 --> 01:14:18.078]  It's a bunch of NGOs.
[01:14:18.078 --> 01:14:20.459]  It's a bunch of Catholic organizations.
[01:14:20.459 --> 01:14:28.445]  See, but they do a pretty good job with this stuff so that you can't even really boycott it.
[01:14:28.445 --> 01:14:29.165]  I understand that.
[01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:31.387]  One last point, if I may real quick, Owen, is
[01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:40.410]  You know, if you if your agenda was mass depopulation, one of the easiest ways they could do that is to herd everybody together in one place.
[01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:43.612]  And that seems like what they're doing for several years, you know.
[01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:53.640]  And so if we I would just be looking out for some false flags or maybe even some sort of like mass casualty events of that sort of thing, because the more people you have mass together,
[01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:55.582]  That's where you're going to have trouble.
[01:14:55.582 --> 01:15:03.409]  We used to say that in the military, just jokingly, you know, when we'd have a gaggle of people all grouped together, we'd say, Grenade!
[01:15:03.409 --> 01:15:11.196]  You know, because that's the sort of mindset that they have, is they're going to take out as many people as possible when they're gathered together like that.
[01:15:11.196 --> 01:15:12.017]  Well, absolutely.
[01:15:14.284 --> 01:15:21.532]  That's why I was talking about earlier how much it... I don't even know how to really... It just, it hit me, it hit me so heavily.
[01:15:21.532 --> 01:15:25.676]  It hit me in such a different way, seeing that gate be the one-way street that it is.
[01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:29.829]  Because it makes you think, just like Nathan is doing.
[01:15:29.829 --> 01:15:33.071]  It makes you think, like, wait a second, what is really going on here?
[01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:35.533]  Why are they bringing in all of North Africa to Europe?
[01:15:35.533 --> 01:15:39.976]  Why are they bringing in all of Central America to North America, to the United States of America?
[01:15:39.976 --> 01:15:43.939]  Like, this is being done intentionally, folks.
[01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:46.520]  There is an agenda here, clearly.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:54.145]  So I don't know if it's as diabolical as what Nathan may have suggested, but if you're not thinking, if you're not looking at this and thinking, what is going on here?
[01:15:54.145 --> 01:15:55.406]  Then you're just not paying attention.
[01:15:55.406 --> 01:15:56.147]  You're just out to lunch.
[01:15:56.147 --> 01:15:56.567]  You're gone.
[01:15:59.189 --> 01:16:01.910]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:06.773]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:16:06.773 --> 01:16:12.097]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:17.760]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.701]  The number one preventable cause
[01:18:20.422 --> 01:18:31.305]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:41.247]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:18:41.247 --> 01:18:43.608]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:46.669]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[01:18:47.409 --> 01:18:49.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth.
[01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:52.652]  The solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.082]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:19:08.082 --> 01:19:17.626]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website, where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:19:17.626 --> 01:19:30.533]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body, as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:19:31.193 --> 01:19:41.115]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:43.496]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you're going to absorb it.
[01:19:43.496 --> 01:19:49.177]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:19:49.177 --> 01:19:51.697]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:51.697 --> 01:19:55.198]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:19:55.198 --> 01:19:56.498]  X3, back in stock.

[01:19:59.747 --> 01:20:05.668]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:33.933]  Remember when they told us we were going to get the Trans Shooters Manifesto, and then we didn't?
[01:20:33.933 --> 01:20:36.494]  And now they're still trying to hold it back.
[01:20:36.494 --> 01:20:39.655]  Trans Shooters Manifesto is now in judges hands.
[01:20:39.655 --> 01:20:46.338]  Regime won't release crazed Trans Shooters writings more than a month after the mass shooting.
[01:20:46.338 --> 01:20:47.379]  Well, we know why.
[01:20:47.379 --> 01:20:49.580]  We know why.
[01:20:53.695 --> 01:20:55.296]  A little consistency would be nice, though.
[01:20:55.296 --> 01:20:58.257]  If you're not going to release any manifestos, then don't release any manifestos.
[01:20:58.257 --> 01:21:01.879]  But if you are going to release some manifestos, then release all manifestos.
[01:21:01.879 --> 01:21:10.624]  But I guess that's why having localized governments is good, because then you don't have tyranny, and they can decide each case.
[01:21:10.624 --> 01:21:16.407]  But we know why they don't want to release that manifesto.
[01:21:16.407 --> 01:21:18.688]  Because it was a Trump supporter, obviously.
[01:21:18.688 --> 01:21:19.868]  They want to protect the Trump movement.
[01:21:19.868 --> 01:21:22.270]  They don't want you to release that trans manifesto.
[01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.570]  Come on.
[01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:24.968]  We all know that.
[01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.410]  That's so obvious.
[01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:27.270]  That's why they're hiding it.
[01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:31.334]  That's why the media's not raising a fuss about it.
[01:21:31.334 --> 01:21:33.375]  Of course.
[01:21:33.375 --> 01:21:33.836]  Of course.
[01:21:33.836 --> 01:21:35.737]  All right, we take a couple more phone calls.
[01:21:35.737 --> 01:21:39.540]  We have Adam in California on the air.
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:43.884]  Adam also has a Banned.Video channel that you can check out, and he's on the air with us now.
[01:21:43.884 --> 01:21:45.845]  Adam, go ahead.
[01:21:45.845 --> 01:21:46.326]  Hey, Owen.
[01:21:46.326 --> 01:21:47.487]  How's it going?
[01:21:47.487 --> 01:21:47.727]  Good.
[01:21:47.727 --> 01:21:53.872]  We got the Adam King Show pulled up here on the screen, so glad to be having your content on Banned.Video.
[01:21:54.864 --> 01:21:56.305]  Yeah, you know, it's quite an honor.
[01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:58.948]  We just did a great show with Gregg Reese.
[01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:01.110]  I encourage everybody to check it out.
[01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:06.354]  Before I get to my question, though, I want to congratulate you and the team on amazing journalism down at the border.
[01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:13.340]  I mean, I don't think anybody in America is covering the story like you guys here are at InfoWars.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.742]  Well, here's the difference.
[01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:23.114]  The one main difference, there's a lot of differences, but the one thing that stands out is the left has activists everywhere.
[01:22:23.114 --> 01:22:28.419]  Their judges are activists, their teachers are activists, their journalists are activists.
[01:22:28.419 --> 01:22:34.964]  And so, yeah, I'm a journalist, and I'm a reporter, and I'm a talk show host, and I'm all these other things, but I'm also an activist.
[01:22:34.964 --> 01:22:40.049]  And so that's what it looks like when you have activists in the world out there that happen to be conservative.
[01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:42.751]  There's going to be more.
[01:22:42.751 --> 01:22:50.795]  It's not going to be just me, but it still is InfoWars that is trying to push that trend and change that for the future.
[01:22:50.795 --> 01:22:54.397]  So I think it's just starting to catch up, though.
[01:22:54.397 --> 01:22:58.340]  Yeah, you know, it was really excellent and you really hit it on the head with that activism.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:10.827]  And also, since it is Mother's Day, I want to give a shout out to all the mothers, but specifically all the InfoWarrior mothers out there who are birthing unvaccinated heterosexual patriots for our movement.
[01:23:11.226 --> 01:23:14.668]  Big shout out to all you ladies.
[01:23:14.668 --> 01:23:17.489]  And yeah, man, InfoWars is the home of the resistance.
[01:23:17.489 --> 01:23:18.570]  It's the tip of the spear.
[01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:21.731]  Without InfoWars, there is no resistance.
[01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:23.312]  There's no forward motion.
[01:23:23.312 --> 01:23:28.714]  This is the place where everything is led from, and you guys clearly showed that down at the border.
[01:23:28.714 --> 01:23:30.135]  And I hope you guys go back.
[01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:34.437]  I hope you guys continue this story and really pound into them.
[01:23:34.437 --> 01:23:35.758]  I wanted to talk to you, Owen.
[01:23:35.758 --> 01:23:39.920]  I wanted to ask you a question and get your thoughts on a subject that I've been pondering for some time.
[01:23:40.595 --> 01:23:44.557]  You know, I kind of have no allegiances and no loyalties moving into 2024.
[01:23:44.557 --> 01:23:49.259]  And, you know, everybody is drunk off the DeSantis Trump thing.
[01:23:49.259 --> 01:23:52.260]  And I'm over here, you know, checking out R.F.K.
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.500]  Jr.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.501]  and all my thoughts.
[01:23:55.501 --> 01:23:59.883]  One thing I want to get your opinion on with Trump and see what you think.
[01:23:59.883 --> 01:24:07.406]  You know, if if Trump is really on our side or if he's not on our side, and one thing I look at is his hiring.
[01:24:07.406 --> 01:24:10.027]  His hiring proves that he is completely
[01:24:10.672 --> 01:24:11.873]  A compromised asset.
[01:24:11.873 --> 01:24:17.856]  I mean, he takes Mark Meadows off the Freedom Caucus, makes him White House Chief of Staff.
[01:24:17.856 --> 01:24:19.777]  Now Mark Meadows is gone.
[01:24:19.777 --> 01:24:21.999]  Corey Radcliffe, DNI.
[01:24:21.999 --> 01:24:23.980]  Devin Nunes is the worst one of all.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:30.043]  He was leading everything going into Russiagate and everything, and now he's CEO in the private sector doing nothing.
[01:24:30.043 --> 01:24:33.585]  It's almost like Trump kiboshed the entire Russia hoax.
[01:24:33.585 --> 01:24:38.148]  I want to get your thoughts on this, mixed with some Jeff Sessions and some, uh,
[01:24:38.763 --> 01:24:39.403]  I don't think so.
[01:24:49.577 --> 01:25:00.922]  When he's hired time after time after time consecutively the wrong people... Well look, I think it's fair to criticize some of Trump's hires, absolutely.
[01:25:00.922 --> 01:25:05.685]  But to say that every person he hired or worked with was bad is just not fair or accurate.
[01:25:05.685 --> 01:25:06.965]  There were good people.
[01:25:06.965 --> 01:25:10.827]  Now as far as how can we trust him to be better in the future, I can't answer that.
[01:25:10.987 --> 01:25:12.789]  There is no answer for me for that.
[01:25:12.789 --> 01:25:23.298]  That's a big, fair concern to have about Donald Trump, that you're either just going to have to trust that he learned to hire better people or doubt it, and that's just going to have to be a decision.
[01:25:23.298 --> 01:25:25.560]  We're just going to have to look at the signs and the symbols.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:36.330]  So the best I could do, I would just play this of General Flynn at a Reawaken America tour event this weekend, where Donald Trump called him live on the event and had this to say.
[01:25:37.748 --> 01:25:45.090]  Trump had to call off his first Iowa rally of his 2024 presidential campaign on Saturday due to a tornado watch in the state.
[01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:49.011]  He instead called into a QAnon-linked event called Reawakening... QAnon-linked event?
[01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:50.531]  Whose lying report is this?
[01:25:50.531 --> 01:25:55.013]  ...adviser Michael Flynn and vowed to bring him back in his next administration.
[01:25:55.013 --> 01:25:59.354]  Trump was scheduled to speak at a Save America rally in Des Moines, Iowa at 7 p.m.
[01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:06.576]  local time, but announced on his social media platform Truth Social that he had been asked to delay or cancel the event because of the severe weather conditions.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:12.303]  He said he would reschedule the rally soon and thanked his supporters for their understanding.
[01:26:12.303 --> 01:26:22.469]  Meanwhile, Trump made a surprise appearance via phone at the Reawaken America Tour in Dallas, Texas, which was organized by QAnon supporter Clay Clark and featured Flynn as one of the speakers.
[01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:29.113]  Trump praised Flynn as a great patriot and a great general and said he would bring him back to his administration if he wins the 2024 election.
[01:26:30.974 --> 01:26:37.859]  Flynn was fired by Trump in 2017 for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia and later pleaded guilty to the same charge.
[01:26:38.809 --> 01:26:46.431]  He was pardoned by Trump in 2020 and has since become a prominent figure in the QAnon conspiracy movement, which believes that Trump is secretly fighting a cabal.
[01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:53.553]  So I thought that this was the actual audio of Trump calling into Flynn, but I guess it was just this other report we had.
[01:26:53.553 --> 01:26:56.014]  So that's a little miscommunication on my part.
[01:26:56.014 --> 01:26:57.274]  I thought that was going to be the phone call.
[01:26:57.274 --> 01:26:59.494]  It was just that other weird report lying about Clay Clark.
[01:26:59.494 --> 01:27:03.956]  But I was going to play it because Trump calls in while Flynn is
[01:27:05.516 --> 01:27:09.745]  On the podium speaking and says that he's going to be hiring Flynn and bringing him back.
[01:27:09.745 --> 01:27:11.208]  So that's a good move.
[01:27:12.113 --> 01:27:14.155]  So again, I can't answer for sure.
[01:27:14.155 --> 01:27:15.956]  Can you trust Trump to hire better people?
[01:27:15.956 --> 01:27:18.819]  I don't, I don't, I mean, I don't know.
[01:27:18.819 --> 01:27:23.863]  All we can do is sit here and watch who he surrounds himself with and make the decision as times go along.
[01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:26.946]  I would hope he's learned who to hire and who not to hire.
[01:27:26.946 --> 01:27:28.087]  But again, we'll just have to wait and see.
[01:27:28.087 --> 01:27:32.471]  All right, let's go to Ron in Michigan.
[01:27:32.471 --> 01:27:35.754]  Ron, you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:35.754 --> 01:27:36.094]  Go ahead.
[01:27:37.321 --> 01:27:38.702]  Hey Owen, how you doing, bud?
[01:27:38.702 --> 01:27:38.942]  Good.
[01:27:38.942 --> 01:27:40.542]  Great job you did on the border.
[01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:41.823]  I really appreciate that.
[01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:42.443]  It was good.
[01:27:42.443 --> 01:27:43.223]  Great coverage.
[01:27:43.223 --> 01:27:43.863]  Thank you.
[01:27:43.863 --> 01:27:49.846]  Yeah, as far as that goes, as far as every... I got two points I want to come up with.
[01:27:49.846 --> 01:27:52.727]  The first thing is the last caller made great points.
[01:27:52.727 --> 01:28:05.111]  What I was going to say is it's easy to figure out who Trump's enemy is because whoever hates them is the ones that you want to, you know, kind of have on a team.
[01:28:05.111 --> 01:28:06.572]  I mean, I mean, the ones that
[01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:11.437]  That hate him is the one you don't want to have on TV, is what I'm trying to say.
[01:28:11.437 --> 01:28:17.221]  But what I'm trying to say, though, as far as McCarthy goes, what has he done?
[01:28:17.221 --> 01:28:18.242]  I mean, he... Nothing!
[01:28:18.242 --> 01:28:19.423]  He's batting zero.
[01:28:19.423 --> 01:28:20.363]  He's been a total failure.
[01:28:20.363 --> 01:28:21.204]  He's done nothing!
[01:28:21.204 --> 01:28:23.285]  It's re-selling everything.
[01:28:23.285 --> 01:28:24.086]  No, he sucks.
[01:28:24.086 --> 01:28:28.689]  He has not done nothing, and it's just really... I gave him a fair shot.
[01:28:28.689 --> 01:28:29.730]  I gave him a fair shot.
[01:28:29.730 --> 01:28:32.872]  I was against his nominee for Speaker of the House.
[01:28:32.872 --> 01:28:35.294]  I was with the Freedom Caucus and their resistance to that.
[01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:42.241]  But when he was able to get through the votes, I said, alright, I'll give him a fair shot, I'll give him a fair shake, and let's see.
[01:28:42.241 --> 01:28:44.704]  So far, he's been a zero impact.
[01:28:44.704 --> 01:28:47.087]  So far, he's been a nothing.
[01:28:47.087 --> 01:28:53.053]  So... And of course, Mitch McConnell is a... He's like a double negative.
[01:28:53.053 --> 01:28:57.038]  He's like a negative that is even more negative because he can't even show up to work anymore.
[01:28:58.991 --> 01:29:05.638]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:29:05.638 --> 01:29:07.560]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.082]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:29:09.082 --> 01:29:11.945]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:13.867]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:29:14.668 --> 01:29:16.628]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:29:16.628 --> 01:29:19.069]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:29:19.069 --> 01:29:21.209]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:29:21.209 --> 01:29:24.590]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:27.791]  There in a mugshot jail background.
[01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:28.831]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.972]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:29:32.972 --> 01:29:34.572]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:29:34.572 --> 01:29:35.592]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:29:35.592 --> 01:29:38.153]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:29:38.153 --> 01:29:38.913]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:29:38.913 --> 01:29:39.833]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:40.253]  2024.
[01:29:40.253 --> 01:29:42.414]  It's a fun conversational piece.
[01:29:42.414 --> 01:29:43.354]  And a limited edition shirt.
[01:29:43.354 --> 01:29:44.114]  Great way to fund.
[01:29:44.494 --> 01:29:45.235]  The operation.

[01:29:58.951 --> 01:30:01.952]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[01:30:01.952 --> 01:30:06.734]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:11.856]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[01:30:11.856 --> 01:30:18.439]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[01:30:18.439 --> 01:30:23.001]  I want to remind you we're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:26.162]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[01:30:26.602 --> 01:30:28.243]  You want to go research.
[01:30:28.243 --> 01:30:34.346]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:35.727]  But they're selling out quick.
[01:30:35.727 --> 01:30:38.388]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[01:30:38.388 --> 01:30:41.609]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[01:30:41.609 --> 01:30:43.950]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:44.771]  It's about to sell out.
[01:30:45.051 --> 01:30:52.778]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at InfoWarstore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:30:52.778 --> 01:30:53.939]  Thank you for your support.
[01:30:58.809 --> 01:31:04.793]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:07.455]  People said, no way, he's the most popular thing that ever happened.
[01:31:07.455 --> 01:31:09.636]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:12.238]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:31:12.238 --> 01:31:15.440]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.221]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:23.846]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:31:23.846 --> 01:31:26.628]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:31:27.591 --> 01:31:29.692]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:31:29.692 --> 01:31:34.336]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:31:34.336 --> 01:31:38.058]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:31:38.058 --> 01:31:41.200]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.762]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:31:43.762 --> 01:31:45.103]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:31:45.103 --> 01:31:48.025]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.

[01:31:58.732 --> 01:32:05.659]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:32:05.659 --> 01:32:14.648]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:32:14.648 --> 01:32:16.870]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:20.791]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:29.313]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:32:29.313 --> 01:32:34.135]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:32:34.135 --> 01:32:45.078]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:32:45.638 --> 01:32:47.679]  Pure nascent iodine.
[01:32:47.679 --> 01:32:51.701]  Stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:32:51.701 --> 01:33:00.606]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:33:00.606 --> 01:33:06.509]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.647 --> 01:33:25.813]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.813 --> 01:33:29.076]  And now, your host, Owen Schroyer.
[01:33:38.965 --> 01:33:43.028]  I will say General Flynn, he's some general, he's some man.
[01:33:43.028 --> 01:33:48.732]  He took abuse like nobody could have handled and he came out bigger, better, stronger than ever before.
[01:33:48.732 --> 01:33:49.352]  We love him.
[01:33:49.352 --> 01:33:54.736]  He's a leader and you just stay wealthy and healthy and well and everything.
[01:33:54.736 --> 01:33:57.078]  I want you to have great lives in general.
[01:33:57.078 --> 01:33:59.940]  You just have to stay healthy because we're bringing you back.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:00.861]  We're gonna bring you back.
[01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:08.251]  My wife's going crazy.
[01:34:08.251 --> 01:34:09.732]  Alright, so there it is.
[01:34:09.732 --> 01:34:20.578]  Donald Trump calling into the Reawaken America Tour, telling Mike Flynn he'll be back working for him if or when he gets back into the White House.
[01:34:20.578 --> 01:34:23.920]  So that's certainly a good thing.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.881]  We're about to take a couple more phone calls here.
[01:34:25.881 --> 01:34:28.843]  I want to let you know, coming up on Sunday Night Live, we've got
[01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:35.192]  A new Alex Jones classic, and that is the Scott Bennett interview.
[01:34:35.192 --> 01:34:38.453]  You don't want to miss this one if you haven't seen it yet.
[01:34:38.453 --> 01:34:38.793]  U.S.
[01:34:38.793 --> 01:34:40.093]  Army PSYOPS expert.
[01:34:40.093 --> 01:34:44.314]  Fox News fired Carlson to maintain a semi-lobotomized, quasi-retarded population.
[01:34:44.314 --> 01:34:45.214]  You remember that?
[01:34:45.214 --> 01:34:46.574]  Yeah, that was U.S.
[01:34:46.574 --> 01:34:48.594]  counter-terror expert Scott Bennett.
[01:34:48.594 --> 01:34:50.675]  He did an interview with Alex Jones.
[01:34:50.675 --> 01:34:53.475]  That's going to be aired in the first hour of Sunday Night Live tonight.
[01:34:53.475 --> 01:34:56.516]  And then John Coleman, this is a little Alex Jones classic.
[01:34:57.386 --> 01:35:00.990]  The committee of 300, the true rulers of the world.
[01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:08.337]  Alex Jones recalls his interview with Dr. John Coleman, a leading expert on the world's secret ruling families.
[01:35:08.337 --> 01:35:14.964]  So, this is a classic throwback here for hour two of Sunday Night Live tonight.
[01:35:14.964 --> 01:35:16.886]  All of this brought to you by InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:35:19.073 --> 01:35:38.805]  Where I like to shop to get my supplements, whether it's the elite flagship supplements like DNA Force Plus and the Real Red Pill Plus, which is a great combination every morning, those two supplements, or it is the energy necessity supplement like Turbo Force Plus that I talk about so much as well.
[01:35:40.825 --> 01:35:48.054]  A necessity, if you're not into supplements, or maybe not a health nut, a necessity is a water filter, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:48.054 --> 01:35:49.715]  Why are you not filtering your water yet?
[01:35:50.868 --> 01:35:58.492]  You can get a water filter right now at InfowarsStore.com and we've already found the nexus point in best quality and best price.
[01:35:58.492 --> 01:36:04.134]  That's what we bring you with the water filter at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:04.134 --> 01:36:06.476]  It's your purchases there that keep us on the air.

[01:36:16.249 --> 01:36:17.130]  And what did we do?
[01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:18.691]  What did we warn about COVID?
[01:36:18.691 --> 01:36:21.813]  It was all a giant depopulation agenda.
[01:36:21.813 --> 01:36:25.695]  And we've got more on that now at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:25.695 --> 01:36:28.577]  Ventilators killed nearly all COVID patients.
[01:36:28.577 --> 01:36:36.902]  According to a new study, the vast majority of COVID patients who required help from a ventilator also developed deadly secondary bacterial pneumonia.
[01:36:36.902 --> 01:36:38.203]  According to analysis published
[01:36:38.743 --> 01:37:03.806]  In the Journal of Clinical Investigation, yeah, it was like 98% of all COVID deaths were in the hospital, and we were detailing this years ago, how they were able to get them on the vents, and that was part of the process that Fauci was a part of, getting them on the remdesivir to fill their lungs up with moisture to then get them on the ventilator that ended up killing them, not COVID.
[01:37:03.806 --> 01:37:04.786]  And that was THE
[01:37:06.872 --> 01:37:08.053]  Procedure from Fauci.
[01:37:08.053 --> 01:37:17.757]  It was a procedure to have you... And now all these top studies are showing it.
[01:37:17.757 --> 01:37:19.078]  Wow.
[01:37:19.078 --> 01:37:20.919]  Most COVID deaths happened in a hospital.
[01:37:20.919 --> 01:37:21.579]  Hmm.
[01:37:21.579 --> 01:37:23.440]  Most of the COVID deaths were from ventilators.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.142]  Hmm.
[01:37:27.142 --> 01:37:29.603]  When will Anthony Fauci have his next congressional testimony?
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:42.569]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[01:37:42.569 --> 01:37:45.512]  So yeah, I wanted to talk about what's going on.
[01:37:45.512 --> 01:37:52.778]  I noticed recently, the last week or so, Alex has been coming to terms with the fact that we're not going to stop what's coming.
[01:37:52.778 --> 01:37:57.902]  And I'm not trying to speak down or anything, but I did call back in
[01:37:59.042 --> 01:38:03.225]  In 2021, I called in and I told Alex, we're not going to stop what's coming.
[01:38:03.225 --> 01:38:12.391]  And I know I'm just, you know, I'm just a regular caller, but the very following week, he had three guests on and all three of those guests all said the same thing.
[01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:14.533]  He was, you know, opening up ideas.
[01:38:14.533 --> 01:38:15.353]  How do we stop this?
[01:38:15.353 --> 01:38:16.434]  How do we turn this back?
[01:38:16.434 --> 01:38:18.695]  Everybody said, we're not going to stop it.
[01:38:18.695 --> 01:38:23.159]  So if you don't mind, I'd like to read a couple of scriptures from the Bible.
[01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:24.419]  Ecclesiastes chapter 7, 15 through 17.
[01:38:29.338 --> 01:38:32.120]  I have seen everything in my days of vanity.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:39.726]  There is a just man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs life in his wickedness.
[01:38:39.726 --> 01:38:43.229]  Do not be overly righteous, nor be overly wise.
[01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:45.271]  Why should you destroy yourself?
[01:38:45.271 --> 01:38:48.193]  Do not be overly wicked, nor be foolish.
[01:38:48.193 --> 01:38:50.755]  Why should you die before your time?
[01:38:50.755 --> 01:38:56.740]  And basically what that means is, although we want to do good, we can't be so good that we let the enemy overrun us.
[01:38:57.341 --> 01:39:00.683]  Now what's going to happen is exactly what's been happening in Europe.
[01:39:00.683 --> 01:39:11.329]  They invade, they allow a bunch of people to invade the country, and then when those people attack us, we have judges and we have district attorneys that turn a blind eye.
[01:39:11.329 --> 01:39:14.611]  But if we defend ourselves, then we get punished.
[01:39:14.611 --> 01:39:18.354]  So what's going to have to happen is we're going to have to defend ourselves.
[01:39:18.354 --> 01:39:20.455]  And we can't seek justice in a corrupt system.
[01:39:21.175 --> 01:39:25.278]  So that means we're going to have to defend ourselves from a corrupt government as well.
[01:39:25.278 --> 01:39:37.645]  You see, I find this to be, I find this to be because when you read that Bible verse, that is the righteousness that's going to kill us.
[01:39:37.645 --> 01:39:45.450]  And I'm not disagreeing with what you said, what you said, but let's look at what just happened in New York City on the subway with that former Marine Daniel Perry.
[01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:49.033]  He steps in and subdues a well-known
[01:39:50.541 --> 01:40:03.213]  Vagrant, a well-known, mentally disturbed, aggressive New York subway rider who sometimes pretends to be Michael Jackson, and now he's facing charges.
[01:40:03.213 --> 01:40:04.014]  Now he's arrested.
[01:40:05.017 --> 01:40:06.678]  And so, think about it like this.
[01:40:06.678 --> 01:40:18.666]  If you're a woman and you ride the New York City subway, the only thing, the only thing that was standing between you and a deranged lunatic was hoping there was a good Samaritan on that train.
[01:40:18.666 --> 01:40:27.672]  Hoping that there was another man on that train, that if you were in a compromising situation with an aggressive, deranged person, that he would step in and try to help you.
[01:40:27.672 --> 01:40:28.493]  Well, that's gone!
[01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:30.431]  That's gone.
[01:40:30.431 --> 01:40:37.434]  So now anybody who wants to do a righteous act like that in public, you're now going to jail.
[01:40:37.434 --> 01:40:41.656]  So is that, I mean, is that the defending yourself that you're talking about?
[01:40:41.656 --> 01:40:45.998]  Is that the over-righteousness that you're talking about?
[01:40:45.998 --> 01:40:51.160]  No, the over-righteousness that I'm talking about is where people, basically they say,
[01:40:51.789 --> 01:41:07.994]  You know, there's people that say, you know, I want to be Christ-like, and I'm a Christian too, but I'm a Christ 2.0, the one that comes back and isn't a peacemaker, because evil has gone so rampant and so out of control, there is no talking people back into their senses.
[01:41:08.484 --> 01:41:19.738]  These people have gone completely wild, and the only way to deal with them, if they're going to bring force on us, we have every right, both in heaven and on earth, to use force in defense of ourselves.
[01:41:19.738 --> 01:41:27.608]  And if I can't go to the Justice Department, if I can't go to our government for justice, and then I take justice into my own hands and I get punished?
[01:41:28.007 --> 01:41:32.510]  Then that means that that government is now an extension of that same evil.
[01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:34.371]  We're at that point, my brother.
[01:41:34.371 --> 01:41:35.312]  We're at that point.
[01:41:35.312 --> 01:41:40.095]  And so really, if you accept that, you have three options.
[01:41:40.095 --> 01:41:42.837]  And this is just the reality, folks.
[01:41:42.837 --> 01:41:50.982]  You can either decide you're going to stay here and recognize that part of that is going to be putting a foot in the ground and saying, I'm going to stay here.
[01:41:50.982 --> 01:41:53.284]  I know my country's been corrupted.
[01:41:53.284 --> 01:41:54.745]  I know my country's been occupied.
[01:41:56.181 --> 01:42:07.244]  Maybe even in some ways conquered, but I'm going to sit here, I'm going to stand for America, I'm going to hope that there can be a better America in the future, or you can stay here and accept that you're going to be a corporate world government slave, or you can leave.
[01:42:07.244 --> 01:42:08.104]  Or you can leave.
[01:42:08.104 --> 01:42:12.825]  But, uh, I mean that's pretty much where I'd say it's at.
[01:42:12.825 --> 01:42:14.705]  And, you know, make your decision.
[01:42:14.705 --> 01:42:15.766]  Make your decision.
[01:42:15.766 --> 01:42:19.427]  People are realizing that it's time to make the decision.
[01:42:19.427 --> 01:42:20.187]  And quite frankly,
[01:42:21.328 --> 01:42:24.330]  A lot of people had made this decision a long time ago.
[01:42:24.330 --> 01:42:28.252]  A lot of people realized this and made this decision a long time ago.
[01:42:28.252 --> 01:42:38.198]  But now it's just completely undeniable and it's a slow creep into the average American realizing that these are the options you have now.
[01:42:38.198 --> 01:42:40.520]  Alright, we're gonna take a couple more calls.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.682]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show coming up here.
[01:42:45.828 --> 01:42:54.488]  We're going to be going to Jason and Joshua and Robert and maybe Dave if we have the time.
[01:42:58.951 --> 01:43:01.532]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:43:01.532 --> 01:43:03.794]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:43:03.794 --> 01:43:05.795]  It will change your life.
[01:43:05.795 --> 01:43:14.539]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:43:14.539 --> 01:43:19.862]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:43:19.862 --> 01:43:21.343]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:43:22.043 --> 01:43:25.586]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:43:25.586 --> 01:43:30.050]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:37.137]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.

[01:44:29.757 --> 01:44:31.278]  Muscles and everything.
[01:44:31.278 --> 01:44:32.159]  Krill oil.

[01:44:39.965 --> 01:44:45.970]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:48.712]  Vitamin C and Zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[01:44:48.712 --> 01:44:50.894]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[01:44:50.894 --> 01:44:52.815]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[01:44:52.815 --> 01:44:56.158]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:44:56.158 --> 01:44:58.180]  You have to have these products.

[01:47:00.569 --> 01:47:06.474]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.346 --> 01:47:31.872]  Okay, final segment here.
[01:47:31.872 --> 01:47:34.653]  By the way, there's a touching video out there.
[01:47:34.653 --> 01:47:40.996]  President Trump surprises elderly Iowa couple that missed Saturday's rally due to tornado warnings.
[01:47:40.996 --> 01:47:44.577]  That's the human touch, the human element of Trump that most other politicians lack.
[01:47:45.998 --> 01:47:53.963]  They're so removed from the normal person, the normal human experience, they can't even relate to it.
[01:47:53.963 --> 01:48:03.110]  Dirty judge Amy Berman Jackson backtracks and blocks Trump from testifying in lawsuit by FBI lovebirds Peter Stroke and Lisa Page.
[01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:13.397]  Yeah, that's because they don't want Trump testifying and talking about that dirty little, that dirty little collusion at the FBI to sabotage Trump's election.
[01:48:15.219 --> 01:48:18.401]  Can't be havin' that.
[01:48:18.401 --> 01:48:20.123]  All right.
[01:48:20.123 --> 01:48:25.827]  Let's start with Jason in Texas here in the final segment of this Sunday's Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:25.827 --> 01:48:29.930]  Remember, we've got some Alex Jones specials coming up on Sunday Night Live.
[01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:32.312]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:32.312 --> 01:48:33.973]  Hey, two things real quick.
[01:48:33.973 --> 01:48:35.214]  First of all, the products.
[01:48:35.214 --> 01:48:38.736]  I got DNA Force Plus, Basso Beat, American 95.
[01:48:38.736 --> 01:48:41.899]  I bought a ton of the hair and beard when it was on sale.
[01:48:41.899 --> 01:48:43.920]  I got like two years worth.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.701]  I got Knockout.
[01:48:45.219 --> 01:48:52.483]  Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, Ultra 12, uh, Survival X3, Survival Shield X3.
[01:48:52.483 --> 01:48:53.623]  My favorite is X2.
[01:48:53.623 --> 01:49:05.249]  I'll tell you real quick, one time I mixed up the Brain, the Ultra 12 with the, uh, X2 and put a whole full dropper in my mouth, okay?
[01:49:05.249 --> 01:49:09.672]  I'd already been taking it for a while, but it was wild.
[01:49:09.672 --> 01:49:11.673]  I don't recommend it, but it's just not...
[01:49:12.997 --> 01:49:17.661]  I like to play chemist with the supplement sometime too, Jason.
[01:49:17.661 --> 01:49:28.671]  So the reason I called though, earlier you were talking about the cell phones with the so-called migrants and the app, right?
[01:49:28.671 --> 01:49:29.151]  Yeah.
[01:49:29.151 --> 01:49:33.515]  I think it would be really cool if, you know,
[01:49:34.542 --> 01:49:41.071]  We could somehow get one of these phones and verify what's on the phone and intercept the push notifications.
[01:49:41.071 --> 01:49:42.393]  I don't know if anyone's done this.
[01:49:42.393 --> 01:49:49.242]  Maybe offer someone, you know, a prepaid phone and 500 bucks or something and get one of these phones.
[01:49:49.953 --> 01:49:53.978]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:49:53.978 --> 01:49:54.698]  An interesting point.
[01:49:54.698 --> 01:49:55.940]  I don't know if that has been done.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:50:04.650]  I do know a couple of the journalists that have been there talking to the migrants and getting access, at least momentarily, to the phone and those envelopes.
[01:50:04.650 --> 01:50:06.371]  So maybe I'll follow up with some of them.
[01:50:06.892 --> 01:50:08.593]  But that would be interesting to see, Jason.
[01:50:08.593 --> 01:50:17.401]  And I think we do have some idea, because like I said, we have had some access, but actually taking it and keeping it and monitoring it in real time, I don't think we've seen that.
[01:50:17.401 --> 01:50:21.104]  Let's go to Joshua in New Jersey.
[01:50:21.104 --> 01:50:23.826]  Joshua, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:50:23.826 --> 01:50:25.628]  Mr. Altman, how are you today?
[01:50:25.628 --> 01:50:26.128]  Good, thank you.
[01:50:26.128 --> 01:50:29.251]  God bless you.
[01:50:29.251 --> 01:50:30.011]  Thank you.
[01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:35.736]  Now, we can all sit here and complain about what's going on, because we are.
[01:50:36.659 --> 01:50:39.681]  And we have to, because we are losing.
[01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:40.401]  We've lost.
[01:50:40.401 --> 01:50:41.482]  We are not losing.
[01:50:41.482 --> 01:50:47.526]  We have lost our country.
[01:50:47.526 --> 01:50:53.549]  Yes, and I think the situation at the border is about as much proof as you need.
[01:50:53.549 --> 01:51:00.493]  So, we need to look in the mirror and we need to stop pushing the blame around on Democrats, Republicans, this one, that one.
[01:51:00.493 --> 01:51:02.735]  We all had a hand in this.
[01:51:02.735 --> 01:51:04.776]  So, let's realize that.
[01:51:04.776 --> 01:51:05.056]  I have.
[01:51:06.144 --> 01:51:19.280]  Um, work with people that were not here legally, that shouldn't have been in the country, they make more money than I make, they get all the free stuff they can get, they're driving around brand new cars, I work my butt off, and I drive a $400 Pontiac Bonnet.
[01:51:21.314 --> 01:51:22.134]  That's number one.
[01:51:22.134 --> 01:51:28.396]  Number two, you want to... Well yeah, this is like, just quickly, this is like, because people will hear this and they won't even believe it.
[01:51:28.396 --> 01:51:35.697]  Folks, there was a story, we had it, she didn't share the story with anybody else, we had the exclusive, I think it may have ended up making the news.
[01:51:35.697 --> 01:51:47.500]  When they were bringing in the Afghan migrants after the failed pullout, they were making sure they got access to the housing market before Americans did.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:48.880]  Point was,
[01:52:14.935 --> 01:52:17.818]  Everybody's talking about voting with their dollar.
[01:52:17.818 --> 01:52:19.759]  Voting with their dollar.
[01:52:19.759 --> 01:52:22.121]  You want to vote with your dollar?
[01:52:22.121 --> 01:52:27.426]  Everybody, in one voice, at one time, stop paying your taxes.
[01:52:27.426 --> 01:52:32.651]  Federal, state, and local, until they get their act together.
[01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:41.959]  Let them take away 8,000 people, put them in jail for not paying their taxes, and 20,000 will show up outside that courthouse and demand their release.
[01:52:42.549 --> 01:52:43.591]  Because we didn't pay either.
[01:52:43.591 --> 01:52:45.435]  Are you gonna arrest 300 million people?
[01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:50.371]  Well, I wish the country was that unified.
[01:52:50.371 --> 01:52:53.512]  I wish that's how that situation would play out.
[01:52:53.512 --> 01:53:03.275]  And, sadly, it'd be like most other situations where the person making the statement or the groups making the statement would be the ones that suffer and face the time.
[01:53:03.275 --> 01:53:06.856]  And then, I don't know if it'd ever get the momentum it would need to get.
[01:53:06.856 --> 01:53:09.957]  I'm not trying to be completely hopeless here.
[01:53:09.957 --> 01:53:13.658]  But, you know, I'm somebody that's put my neck out there and been arrested many times.
[01:53:13.658 --> 01:53:15.219]  Many times making a political statement.
[01:53:16.113 --> 01:53:34.201]  And I'd hate to be the only person doing that the rest of my life, but that's why they, that's why I was talking about, that's why Joe Biden is at a Howard University graduation ceremony talking about white supremacy and that's why Mayorkas is warning about white supremacy because they want us divided so that we can never unify on something like that.
[01:53:34.201 --> 01:53:36.142]  Hey, let's just all stop paying taxes.
[01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.783]  Our government is corrupted.
[01:53:37.783 --> 01:53:39.423]  Our government is criminal.
[01:53:39.423 --> 01:53:40.464]  We're broke.
[01:53:40.464 --> 01:53:42.004]  We're going through hard times.
[01:53:42.004 --> 01:53:44.365]  They keep stealing our money and giving it to foreigners.
[01:53:44.365 --> 01:53:45.166]  We're done.
[01:53:45.766 --> 01:53:47.186]  I wish we could reach that point.
[01:53:47.186 --> 01:53:48.487]  I'm not sure we're there yet, Joshua.
[01:53:48.487 --> 01:53:49.067]  Thanks for the call.
[01:53:49.067 --> 01:53:50.687]  Let's go to Robert in Alabama.
[01:53:50.687 --> 01:53:51.408]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:53:51.408 --> 01:53:58.489]  Go ahead.
[01:53:58.489 --> 01:54:02.511]  All right, we got a panel on the... Okay, Robert, go ahead.
[01:54:02.511 --> 01:54:03.411]  Hey, sorry about that.
[01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:07.152]  Let me give... Give me one second to take you off speaker.
[01:54:07.152 --> 01:54:09.312]  All right.
[01:54:09.312 --> 01:54:12.993]  Hey Owen, I don't... I don't understand how you had the composure to
[01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:21.191]  Keep your poise when you're at the border and they're just gaslighting you constantly.
[01:54:21.191 --> 01:54:31.674]  However, I think you're, um, you know, pretty much everyone in America who sees what's going on feels the same way.
[01:54:31.674 --> 01:54:42.977]  We want to just scream at them and understand why they're just going to allow themselves to, you know, be gaslit and all these other things.
[01:54:43.902 --> 01:54:46.884]  Well look, there's going to be a realization in this country soon.
[01:54:46.884 --> 01:54:48.945]  And the realization is this.
[01:54:48.945 --> 01:54:54.527]  And I guess, I try to explain this, and I definitely live this example.
[01:54:54.527 --> 01:54:57.829]  The same thing happened two weeks ago.
[01:54:57.829 --> 01:55:04.973]  I'm at the Texas Capitol building, and I'm sitting there with the group of trans kids activists.
[01:55:06.215 --> 01:55:08.996]  And they're up to their normal tactics.
[01:55:08.996 --> 01:55:16.320]  And so I basically just called them out right there at the Texas State Capitol, right to their face, with the cameras rolling.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:25.003]  And a bunch of people walked by, Republican staffers and state legislators and just people that work at the Capitol, walked by.
[01:55:25.003 --> 01:55:28.985]  And I'm watching them walk by, the cameras are on me, but I'm watching them walk by.
[01:55:28.985 --> 01:55:35.268]  And they're shaking their head and they're cheering in agreement and they're putting their fists in the air and they're like stunned that somebody's calling it out to their face.
[01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:38.911]  It's like, oh, you can do that?
[01:55:38.911 --> 01:55:41.092]  Like, you can push back against these bullies?
[01:55:41.092 --> 01:55:43.454]  Like, you can call out these bullies?
[01:55:43.454 --> 01:55:45.275]  Wait, like, I'm an American?
[01:55:45.275 --> 01:55:46.035]  I have free speech?
[01:55:46.035 --> 01:55:47.996]  Like, oh!
[01:55:47.996 --> 01:56:04.147]  It's kind of like, there's a famous image of when I stood up during the Nadler impeachment hoax, and I stand up and I call him out, and there's a famous image where one of the guys in front of me has this look on his face like he can't even believe it.
[01:56:04.932 --> 01:56:12.516]  He can't even believe there's an American left on this planet that will actually stand up and tell the truth.
[01:56:12.516 --> 01:56:15.758]  And you can see his face like, oh my gosh, someone's actually willing to stand up and tell the truth?
[01:56:15.758 --> 01:56:18.019]  Someone's not actually afraid of our government?
[01:56:18.019 --> 01:56:20.660]  Somebody's not actually afraid of Jerry Nadler and the Democrats?
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:25.183]  Somebody's not actually afraid of these leftist liberal crazies?
[01:56:25.183 --> 01:56:26.783]  Same thing at the border.
[01:56:26.783 --> 01:56:27.524]  Same thing at the border.
[01:56:28.803 --> 01:56:43.857]  Why should I, as an American who's not breaking the law, be afraid of Border Patrol telling me to turn my camera off, telling me I can't talk, because we're exposing the illegal immigration pipeline and Biden's border invasion?
[01:56:43.857 --> 01:56:49.603]  So, you started to kind of hear some grumblings from some other people in that video starting to raise their voice up a little bit.
[01:56:51.587 --> 01:56:55.689]  So the realization that Americans need to have is that, folks, you are a free person.
[01:56:55.689 --> 01:56:57.570]  You are not meant to be a slave.
[01:56:57.570 --> 01:56:59.291]  You have a birthright.
[01:56:59.291 --> 01:57:01.452]  You have a birthright as an American.
[01:57:01.452 --> 01:57:05.394]  And I don't like this whole, uh, we was kings, we was queens thing.
[01:57:05.394 --> 01:57:09.636]  But no, the truth of the matter is, that was what was established in 1776.
[01:57:09.636 --> 01:57:12.258]  That you are your own king.
[01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:17.280]  You are your own king of your own life and your own future and your own destiny and your own family.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.761]  And it's time to start acting like it.
[01:57:20.236 --> 01:57:27.622]  So yeah, would the king of the jungle would align with the king walking a border patrol agent saying, there's no buses coming through here, turn off your cameras and stop talking.
[01:57:27.622 --> 01:57:29.724]  No, he'd stand up and call him a liar!
[01:57:29.724 --> 01:57:31.785]  That's what an American behaves like!
[01:57:31.785 --> 01:57:33.427]  So, but this is the realization.
[01:57:33.427 --> 01:57:40.493]  You are an American, you have a birthright, you have a destiny, it's time to stand up and take it back.
[01:57:40.493 --> 01:57:44.396]  That does it for the Alex Jones Show, but stay tuned for some classic Alex Jones coming up next.

[01:57:55.979 --> 01:58:04.745]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:58:04.745 --> 01:58:10.069]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:11.550]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:15.794]  Is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:58:15.794 --> 01:58:20.258]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:58:20.258 --> 01:58:27.345]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
