[00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:17.425]  I've been on air 29 years and I think I've proven that I mean what I say and that most of the time I'm accurate and I don't think that most of you would disagree with me that we're in grave danger of massive expanded biological slash nuclear war.
[00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:26.033]  There's certainly an escalated kinetic war going on in Ukraine and expanding into the South China Sea.
[00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.112]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to get into Tucker Carlson.
[00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:33.295]  This is not going to be a race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
[00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:43.804]  And I think that is what the establishment is planning to do, to remove both of them, I believe, by all these mounting legal cases, and if they have to, assassination.
[00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:46.826]  They'll blame the assassination of Biden.
[00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.654]  On a right winger, Trump supporter, and they'll blame the assassination of Trump on a Biden supporter to get us all each other's throats.
[00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:57.276]  Now is not the time to do that.
[00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:02.779]  It is never the time to go around assassinating these leaders.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.262]  And that will turn this country into an explosion.
[00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.793]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:37.646]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:38.567]  InfoWars.
[00:01:38.907 --> 00:01:39.827]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:40.408]  Today.
[00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:46.407]  From the people who brought you... You know nothing.
[00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:50.429]  And be happy.
[00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:55.471]  ...comes a brand new collection of hit songs from our beloved Supreme Leader.
[00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:58.072]  Timelize presents The Great Here Set!
[00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.372]  Volume 14!
[00:01:59.772 --> 00:02:01.713]  Everybody!
[00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:04.674]  Cap your body right!
[00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.195]  Vaccine spec?
[00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:09.056]  All right!
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.061]  One, two, three and to the floor.
[00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:16.542]  Klaus Schwabisch, Schwab and Bill Gates is at the door.
[00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.063]  Ready to put a patent on air and glass.
[00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:20.984]  Cause we about to greatly set your ass.
[00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:24.006]  It's like this and like that and like this and that.
[00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:26.407]  So just cheer till the next pandemic.
[00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:34.323]  Digital identity.
[00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.784]  You shall have until 2030.
[00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:46.788]  No discussion for it is mandatory.
[00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:50.149]  You will see.
[00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.510]  Fifteen minute city.
[00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.311]  Fifteen minute city.
[00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.392]  Stay close to home.
[00:02:56.512 --> 00:03:04.512]   15 minute city 15 minute city or we'll send a drone
[00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:08.419]   You better comply You better watch out.
[00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.880]  You better implant that microchip now.
[00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:17.223]  Fanta Claus is running the town.
[00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.065]  Every meal you make.
[00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:23.947]  Every bite you take.
[00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:32.912]  Every single lunch, with a crispy crunch, you will eat that box.
[00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:34.854]  The Great Here Set, Volume 14.
[00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:36.415]  Get yours now.
[00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:38.958]  Available on Shotify and Pfizer Music.
[00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.703]  In your opinion, how is the switch, the forced switch, to electric going?
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.361]  It's going disastrously.
[00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:52.748]  First of all, on this strike, pending strike, you have a million workers making non-electric cars.
[00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:58.215]  With these electric car mandates, you're talking about 40%, 400,000 workers being displaced.
[00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:03.682]  There's also about 7.5 million jobs related to the auto industry that are going to be impacted.
[00:04:04.302 --> 00:04:09.749]  Joe Biden's EV mandates are a controlled demolition of the US auto industry.
[00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:20.563]  There's no other way to put it because China is the main beneficiary and we're seeing a Chinese, potential Chinese invasion of cars, EV cars coming as they master it.
[00:04:20.763 --> 00:04:26.027]   The transition is going Horribly, but I think that's not the actual purpose of this Biden plan.
[00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:33.372]  The plan is to create vehicle rationing to force less people to drive, force us into mass transit, and restrict our freedom of movement.
[00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.433]  That's what's coming out of these climate plans.
[00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:38.515]  But Mark, that is politically out of the question.
[00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:46.880]  Any administration which imposes rationing on cars, limiting your ability to drive, in these here United States, that's political suicide.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.442]  It is, but that's why it's in 2035.
[00:04:50.482 --> 00:04:53.704]  That's why it's several years away.
[00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:54.624]  But here's the key.
[00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:56.906]  Has Congress voted on a car ban?
[00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:57.426]  No.
[00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:59.767]  Has even the California legislator voted?
[00:05:00.087 --> 00:05:00.328]  No.
[00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:05.591]  This is all being done bypassing democracy, in many ways the same way the COVID restrictions.
[00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:07.872]  We didn't vote for church closures, school closures.
[00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:10.994]  Well, we didn't vote now for food restrictions.
[00:05:11.014 --> 00:05:12.855]  We didn't vote for the gas-powered car ban.
[00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:22.203]  This is a corporate government collusion, mostly coming from ideology, coming from the United Nations World Economic Forum, and they are forcing this upon us.
[00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:27.267]  Now, it's not affecting us immediately, but it's down the road, and the question is, are we going to allow it?
[00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:34.112]  It looks like this whole EV mandate thing is going to collapse when people realize that it is going to create car rationing.
[00:05:34.132 --> 00:05:36.595]  I mean, this is similar to East Germany.
[00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:41.699]  They had one government-authorized car, the crappy East German Trabant.
[00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:51.556]  Fast forward, here in the United States, we're basically saying the government is saying you can only buy one car in the future, an EV, likely manufactured solely from China.
[00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:55.042]  This is our future if we allow it, Stuart, and it's going terrible.
[00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:04.128]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Tucker Carlson is predicting they're going to cancel the 2024 election.
[00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:06.449]  I've already predicted that, so has Jack Posobiec.
[00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:07.790]  The evidence is all there.
[00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.410]  We're going into full martial law.
[00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:13.713]  Internet kill switches, open borders, new bio-attacks, total hell.
[00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.294]  This is the end of America and probably the world as we know it.
[00:06:16.874 --> 00:06:18.015]  Kiss your asses goodbye.
[00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:19.736]  It happens.
[00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:27.780]  It happens more often in history, in human civilization, than free open societies happen.
[00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:43.437]  Free, open, virtuous, creatively driven societies that build a great world are exactly five or six that you can count on your hands.
[00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:54.143]  But if you look at the tyrannies and the oppressions of history, there are literally thousands of them.
[00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:55.524]  Thousands.
[00:06:56.224 --> 00:06:57.725]  Stretching back in recorded history 8,000 years.
[00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:10.507]  And there is a mindset, there is a megalomania, there is a signature to this.
[00:07:11.888 --> 00:07:23.814]  When these corrupt organizations and groups form and get power and then are unopposed, they become completely delusional and drunk on power.
[00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:29.617]  You know what happens when you get drunk and go out and drive your car, you run into an oak tree.
[00:07:30.836 --> 00:07:32.738]  Or kill some innocent family.
[00:07:33.698 --> 00:07:35.079]  Or run over somebody on a bicycle.
[00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:41.544]  If you drink a bottle of Jack Daniels and get out on the road, there's a good chance you're going to do it.
[00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:48.850]  But when you're drunk on power, it always leads to giant wars, famines, collapse, mass death.
[00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:51.892]  But society can always reorganize.
[00:07:51.932 --> 00:08:03.705]   You add biological, chemical, radiological, thermonuclear weapons Weather weapons, seismic weapons, tectonic weapons.
[00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:06.969]  Into the mix.
[00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:10.733]  Electromagnetic weapons.
[00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:13.557]  Particle weapons.
[00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:18.419]  and you end the world as we know it.
[00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:31.018]   If Hitler would have had really powerful biological weapons or atomic weapons, he would have used them,
[00:08:31.018 --> 00:08:38.359]   but British special forces and others were able to continue to sneak into the country
[00:08:38.359 --> 00:08:42.319]   and do some of those daring missions ever and destroy those facilities.
[00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:47.319]  [ Silence ]
[00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:53.682]  But atomic weapons that the United States was developed at the same time are like tinker toys.
[00:08:56.567 --> 00:09:01.370]  Or like a pop gun with shoots a cork out of the end compared to a 12-gauge shotgun that they have today.
[00:09:05.272 --> 00:09:09.455]  It's like a BB gun compared to a howitzer cannon.
[00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:17.840]  And I've really looked at this and I've really thought about this and I've had talks with Tucker about it recently.
[00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.241]  And others.
[00:09:21.682 --> 00:09:33.117]   And we really believe That this is going to expand into thermonuclear war, and that most of the people watching this show right now will be dead within a year.
[00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:37.540]  Now, that's not a prediction.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.165]  It's like saying they're going to try to roll out COVID protocols next month, and then they tried to roll them out, but I said if we oppose it enough, they're going to have real trouble implementing it.
[00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:56.860]   Though they're doing it all over Europe, Canada, the U.S., whole hospital districts, whole states, whole Regions, British Columbia, you name it.
[00:09:57.281 --> 00:09:59.941]  New York's gone back to mask mandates in the hospitals.
[00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:06.863]  They've got vaccine mandates at Baylor here in Texas and other big universities all over the country.
[00:10:06.883 --> 00:10:11.684]  I mean, that was an accurate story, but we did get ahead of it and it mitigated it some.
[00:10:11.804 --> 00:10:14.905]  So, I'm not saying we will die in a nuclear war.
[00:10:17.082 --> 00:10:26.405]  It's like saying if you inject three times the overdose amount of heroin, and you've never taken heroin and haven't built up a tolerance, it's going to kill you.
[00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:30.666]  Unless you do it at the hospital and they can give you drugs that counteract it on the spot.
[00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:39.728]  You shoot up three times the lethal dose of heroin, at home, in your bed, there's about a 99% chance you're gonna die.
[00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:50.987]   Some people that have Native American backgrounds or other interesting genetics Heroin will not kill them at lethal doses.
[00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:52.308]  You have to give them like ten times.
[00:10:53.369 --> 00:10:58.692]  Rasputin, the famous Russian, on record was given enough poison to kill five horses and he wouldn't die.
[00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:03.435]  They had to shoot him a bunch and throw him in a frozen river to kill it.
[00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:14.161]  So there are some people that are super tough and their physiologies are different.
[00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:24.115]  When I have surgery, I have to be given curare, because when I had my first surgery, I had a compound fracture when I was 16.
[00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:34.419]  I almost died, because the anesthesiologist kept giving me the regular drug they gave, and it wouldn't put me under.
[00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:39.481]  They had to restrain me, and almost stopped the surgery, but finally got me out.
[00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:43.183]  So now I've had a few other surgeries since, on my bicep, on a hernia.
[00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:48.436]  And they listened, they got my medical records, and they gave me terraria, and it's amazing.
[00:11:48.857 --> 00:11:50.357]  Wake up feeling great, by the way.
[00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:51.918]  Paralyzes you, though.
[00:11:54.859 --> 00:12:00.440]  But that's the stuff from the Amazon, you know, the natives put on the end of the little darts.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.882]  I guess it's frog poison, if I remember correctly.
[00:12:06.454 --> 00:12:07.835]  So that's my analogy.
[00:12:08.316 --> 00:12:14.280]  It's basically the globalists are injecting us with three, four times the lethal dose and just hoping we don't die.
[00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.503]  I mean, we're barreling into thermal nuclear war.
[00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:19.064]  We're in World War III with Russia.
[00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:22.087]  The mainline analyst and even Zelensky admits that.
[00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:24.108]  Things are only escalating.
[00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:33.078]   The authoritarian people running the West are Turning their intelligence agencies loose on their populations.
[00:12:33.098 --> 00:12:34.098]  They're flooding borders.
[00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:43.780]  They are human trafficking little children and not even arresting people that have other people's children that they've drugged with fentanyl.
[00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.161]  So they're passed out.
[00:12:47.721 --> 00:12:53.923]  And I've got new videos today of a bunch of babies dying because they were put on fentanyl to pass them out and then they just die.
[00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:58.993]   and other babies that have been drugged up and they stopped a few months ago even giving them
[00:12:58.993 --> 00:13:04.592]   DNA testing. They can do it in a day. Oh, you're a man with a little kid with you. You don't look
[00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:07.352]  like him. You don't have IDs saying you're their parents.
[00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:11.573]   We're going to hold you and check that you are their biological. They can tell if you're a cousin,
[00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:17.532]   third cousin. They can tell if you're an aunt, an uncle, a brother, a sister. Quick one-day test.
[00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:20.192]   Biden said, "No, they're not doing that anymore."
[00:13:20.378 --> 00:13:40.710]  So we have now incredible footage, a whole bunch of footage of drugged babies, I mean two-year-olds, one-year-olds, being carried underneath the fences through the water, and then just give them to the Border Patrol, then just say, okay, it's your kid, let them just go into the country with the kid.
[00:13:42.793 --> 00:13:44.734]  We got footage ourselves of them at the airports doing that.
[00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:48.276]  Or just the same woman all day, shows up every hour with another baby.
[00:13:48.936 --> 00:13:51.197]  No paperwork, says, it's my baby, I give it to you.
[00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:54.939]  They just give it to a non-governmental organization, NGO, disappears.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.561]  This government isn't just completing the smuggling process.
[00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:07.124]  This government is totally reprobate, totally gone, no bottom, and does anything and everything it wants.
[00:14:10.486 --> 00:14:15.293]   And so, The sky's the limit is basically what I'm getting at here.
[00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.454]  So we've got some clips coming up.
[00:14:16.494 --> 00:14:19.919]  I'm going to get into some of the other news and tell you what's coming up next segment.
[00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:23.683]  I'm going to play a clip from Jack Masovic a few weeks ago on the show.
[00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:25.545]  Of course, you know I've been saying this ad nauseam.
[00:14:26.126 --> 00:14:30.371]  Tucker Carlson says that the end is near.
[00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.453]  And that there's a good chance they're going to outright cancel the election or that it won't be Trump and won't be Biden.
[00:14:36.493 --> 00:14:37.954]  Biden will be made to be removed.
[00:14:38.615 --> 00:14:40.756]  Somehow they'll remove Trump, assassinate him, who knows.
[00:14:41.437 --> 00:14:42.037]  Sky's the limit.
[00:14:42.057 --> 00:14:43.178]  They're certainly not going to back down.
[00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:48.101]  And then they're going to install a fake election with fake candidates.
[00:14:48.121 --> 00:15:05.497]   I mean, you can see the setup for it and all the declarations of emergency and just the whole political, cultural, spiritual, economic, military climate is Ten times crazier than the prelude to World War I or World War II.
[00:15:06.157 --> 00:15:10.138]  And all the same ingredients are there, just souped up with nitrous oxide.
[00:15:09.977 --> 00:15:14.856]   It's like you got a race car and it's already got a thousand horsepower and you put nitrous oxide on it gives
[00:15:14.856 --> 00:15:17.436]   it 2,000 horsepower
[00:15:17.436 --> 00:15:29.418]   And so they've now hooked nitrous oxide onto this or dumped a ton of gasoline and then some TNT on a fire and
[00:15:30.237 --> 00:15:32.918]  And they're megalomaniacs, and they're gonna blow it all up, folks.
[00:15:34.258 --> 00:15:40.981]  I mean, I would give it a 60% chance we're in a full nuclear war within one year.
[00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:43.882]  I mean, I believe that.
[00:15:44.442 --> 00:15:47.743]  And I think you know that's true deep down.
[00:15:48.163 --> 00:15:49.103]  You can feel the danger.
[00:15:50.404 --> 00:15:52.164]  So we gotta get these maniacs out of there.
[00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:53.325]  I've been on air 29 years.
[00:15:56.263 --> 00:16:00.204]  And I think I've proven that I mean what I say and that most of the time I'm accurate.
[00:16:01.304 --> 00:16:09.886]  And I don't think that most of you would disagree with me that we're in grave danger of massive expanded biological slash nuclear war.
[00:16:11.507 --> 00:16:18.548]  There's certainly an escalated kinetic war going on in Ukraine and expanding into the South China Sea.
[00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:22.589]  So coming up next segment, I'm going to get into Tucker Carlson.
[00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.710]  This is not going to be a race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
[00:16:27.614 --> 00:16:36.261]  And I think that is what the establishment is planning to do, to remove both of them, I believe, by all these mounting legal cases, and if they have to, assassination.
[00:16:37.582 --> 00:16:47.130]  They'll blame the assassination of Biden on a right-winger Trump supporter, and they'll blame the assassination of Trump on a Biden supporter, to get us all in each other's throats.
[00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:49.772]  Now is not the time to do that.
[00:16:51.974 --> 00:16:55.217]  It is never the time to go around assassinating these leaders.
[00:16:56.772 --> 00:16:59.754]  And that will turn this country into an explosion.
[00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:03.336]  An angrier world that Klaus Schwab has talked about.
[00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:21.987]  So, I want the listeners to know and I want the different power structures to know and everybody to know, anybody that studied history and can see what's happening currently knows, the leadership of the planet, these committees, mainly of lawyers, now running military policy is insane.
[00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:32.526]   And you've got a bunch of politician generals in the West, That all they've done is run police actions and drug running operations.
[00:17:32.806 --> 00:17:35.448]  They're a bunch of thug criminals that run our military at the top.
[00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:42.533]  It has disaster in Armageddon and nuclear conflagration written all over it.
[00:17:42.593 --> 00:17:45.215]  So I'm done talking about that right now.
[00:17:45.235 --> 00:17:46.697]  I'm going to get into it next segment.
[00:17:46.717 --> 00:17:48.458]  And I don't like talking like this.
[00:17:49.198 --> 00:17:52.161]  It's making me physically nauseous right now.
[00:17:52.601 --> 00:17:53.562]  I am nauseous.
[00:17:55.014 --> 00:18:04.597]  To be saying this on air, and to be meaning it, and to be taking it in myself, because it's one thing to intellectually know it, it's another thing to spiritually know it, it's another thing to speak it out loud.
[00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.138]  And I'm having trouble doing the show right now, I'll be completely honest with you.
[00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:24.991]   I look at how disconnected the general public is, we've had it so good for so long, the football, the Netflix, the movies, the entertainment, the stripper clubs, all of it, And people are letting the good times roll as we roll right off the edge of a cliff.
[00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:28.812]  And I'm not attacking people that like football or Netflix.
[00:18:28.912 --> 00:18:36.254]  What I'm saying is that the government's been doing this since Biden got in, but it's accelerated.
[00:18:36.914 --> 00:18:38.174]  They work with the cartels.
[00:18:38.194 --> 00:18:39.694]  They let them drug the children.
[00:18:40.174 --> 00:18:41.735]  No one knows whose children they are.
[00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:46.796]  Think about a government that does that officially in front of news cameras.
[00:18:49.056 --> 00:18:53.284]  And then we've got reports they lock kids up in warehouses for days without food.
[00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:55.869]  That's how overwhelmed it is.
[00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:01.740]  And then they claim Trump put kids in cages and that was video of Obama.
[00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:13.673]  And then Project Veritas gets all the footage of the kids in Austin, as young as six, admitting they're in sex slavery, and the Senate report confirms massive sex slavery of children.
[00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:15.654]  This is who runs our government.
[00:19:15.994 --> 00:19:19.355]  Do you think they're going to be nice to you?
[00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:22.396]  No, they're devaluing your currency.
[00:19:23.616 --> 00:19:32.139]  They're allowing geoengineering of the atmosphere with poisonous radioactive isotopes being sprayed by the Air Force and Department of Energy aircraft.
[00:19:33.157 --> 00:19:34.317]  And it's all declassified.
[00:19:34.598 --> 00:19:35.638]  I have a CIA director.
[00:19:35.838 --> 00:19:36.798]  I have stacks of documents.
[00:19:37.038 --> 00:19:37.719]  I have videos.
[00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:39.219]  I have Air Force whistleblowers.
[00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.080]  These are crazy people!
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.621]  That could go on.
[00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:52.864]  Transgenderism, the hospitals gearing up to sterilize millions of children to cut their organs out, their genitals off, their breasts off.
[00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:57.806]  If you told somebody that 20 years ago, this would be happening, they'd say you were crazy.
[00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:03.531]  And all the convicted pedophiles involved in drag queen pervert time.
[00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:07.973]  And it's being funded by Disney and all these big companies.
[00:20:08.594 --> 00:20:09.854]  These are just Satanists.
[00:20:10.014 --> 00:20:10.895]  It's pure evil.
[00:20:11.695 --> 00:20:12.616]  It's spiritual.
[00:20:14.457 --> 00:20:15.978]  It's a spiritual attack.
[00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:18.639]  Look what we've become.
[00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:19.780]  And here's the thing.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.200]  It's not getting better.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.721]  It's going off the edge of a cliff.
[00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:28.224]  We are free-falling right now into a spiritual black hole.
[00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:36.552]  We are falling into a nightmarish abyss.
[00:20:39.715 --> 00:20:48.401]  And at this point, we need to pray.
[00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:53.445]  I mean, I really just feel like praying on air.
[00:20:54.746 --> 00:20:56.788]  And I'm not somebody that's big on praying on air.
[00:20:56.908 --> 00:21:00.311]  I just feel like we should be praying, all of us, for an awakening.
[00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:39.481]   And for a coming back to our senses and for people that work in the government corporations to continue to leak information on the bad guys that run the top of every major organization and to not comply and to realize that because there's capture of the judiciary in Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US, and that there's a globalist capture of the federal police and the federal Courts of the Western world that the very worst agents of this are in place and are directing this.
[00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:40.702]  I mean, it's come out in the news.
[00:21:41.202 --> 00:21:45.544]  I've talked to federal whistleblowers, judges, you name it, high level, federal judges.
[00:21:46.985 --> 00:21:47.605]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:21:50.106 --> 00:21:52.948]  With good federal officers that actually care in the meetings.
[00:21:54.141 --> 00:21:56.042]  And they're saying, we'll direct you here, we'll direct you there.
[00:21:56.062 --> 00:22:08.432]  And it's all in the public docket that Merrick Garland, to the main federal judge in Texas and all the magistrates, will not let them charge human traffickers that are convicted pedophiles and order them released.
[00:22:09.352 --> 00:22:13.495]  And the judges are like, it's in the public record, can you report on this?
[00:22:16.157 --> 00:22:23.483]  And can you get this information to Tucker Carlson and to Joe Rogan?
[00:22:25.168 --> 00:22:26.789]  And then it did get to Tucker.
[00:22:26.829 --> 00:22:29.130]  He was about to do a whole show on it right when he got fired.
[00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.991]  A whole week of shows on it.
[00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:35.253]  Now he's doing it on X and reaching a much larger audience.
[00:22:35.293 --> 00:22:41.856]  But this is a cult, folks.
[00:22:43.337 --> 00:22:45.278]  Not just in Canada, but all over the Western world.
[00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:54.843]  Anyone that is in an anthropology department or archaeology department that says there's male and female skeletons is getting fired or sued or demoted.
[00:22:56.704 --> 00:22:57.504]  I mean, think about that.
[00:22:58.665 --> 00:23:04.806]  They're now telling police departments they can't identify skeletons they find in a field as a male or female.
[00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:07.687]  I mean, this is total control.
[00:23:07.927 --> 00:23:10.428]  If you'll accept that, you'll accept two men can have a baby.
[00:23:10.687 --> 00:23:18.207]   They do this on purpose to create something so asinine, so ridiculous, so crazy, so over the top
[00:23:18.207 --> 00:23:30.046]   that they just expect it will just roll over and murder logic.
[00:23:30.275 --> 00:23:33.537]  But it's logic and truth that's going to bring us justice and peace.
[00:23:34.558 --> 00:23:43.163]  But we do have megalomaniac control freaks in control who are driven by a spirit of destruction.
[00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:46.104]  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:47.825]  The Great Deceiver.
[00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:48.826]  The Wicked One.
[00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:52.060]  And you can't deny that that's what's happening.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.824]  These people are going out of their way to destroy themselves as well as us.
[00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:03.752]  And they love having the military and the Border Patrol and all these people, agents of their evil, carrying it all out.
[00:24:05.774 --> 00:24:07.615]  It's the Great Awakening or the Great Destruction.
[00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:08.056]  Stay with us.
[00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:15.012]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:24:15.092 --> 00:24:16.493]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:24:16.553 --> 00:24:21.716]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:24:21.776 --> 00:24:23.177]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:24:23.237 --> 00:24:23.758]  Damn it!
[00:24:23.798 --> 00:24:24.158]  Why?
[00:24:24.879 --> 00:24:30.863]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:24:31.483 --> 00:24:34.465]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:24:37.228 --> 00:24:42.211]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:24:42.251 --> 00:24:43.212]  You decided, sir.
[00:24:43.272 --> 00:24:44.192]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:24:44.212 --> 00:24:45.593]  You told me every television in London!
[00:24:45.873 --> 00:24:49.275]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:24:49.776 --> 00:24:59.902]  And where once you had the freedom to object, think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subduing your submission.
[00:25:00.622 --> 00:25:01.343]  How did this happen?
[00:25:01.863 --> 00:25:02.824]  Who's to blame?
[00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:06.468]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:25:06.488 --> 00:25:08.431]  They will be held accountable.
[00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:14.279]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:16.711]  I know why you did it.
[00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:19.672]  I know you were afraid, cooling me.
[00:25:20.192 --> 00:25:22.253]  War, terror, disease.
[00:25:22.873 --> 00:25:28.695]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:25:29.296 --> 00:25:35.038]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:25:35.518 --> 00:25:42.518]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:25:42.518 --> 00:25:50.518]  There is a war.
[00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:51.252]  It's happening now.
[00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:53.933]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:25:54.513 --> 00:25:56.393]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:25:57.114 --> 00:25:58.594]  We are the resistance.
[00:25:58.994 --> 00:26:06.515]  We are the Infowar.
[00:26:07.535 --> 00:26:09.176]  Emergency news broadcast.
[00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:13.096]  Experts warn deep state planning to cancel 2024 presidential election.
[00:26:13.617 --> 00:26:16.017]  Launch full war with Russia.
[00:26:17.438 --> 00:26:20.379]  The end is near if we don't stop them.
[00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:22.739]  In fact, I wrote that headline, but let's expand it.
[00:26:23.099 --> 00:26:25.060]  The end is near if we don't stop them.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.180]  If we don't stop these madmen.
[00:26:30.041 --> 00:26:32.121]  Because we're not saying the world's going to end.
[00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:41.343]  We're saying these cycles have gone through before where you get megalomaniac, control freak, plutocrats, and oligarchies in control.
[00:26:41.403 --> 00:26:48.994]   That's really what we've got is gangs, consortiums, Run by BlackRock and others, where they can have the politicians and others go out and do the dirty work.
[00:26:49.954 --> 00:26:52.275]  The general public doesn't know it's the globalists doing it.
[00:26:52.855 --> 00:26:54.576]  They believe it's their own populations.
[00:26:54.596 --> 00:26:55.656]  They start fighting with each other.
[00:26:55.696 --> 00:26:56.756]  They start fighting with their neighbors.
[00:26:57.257 --> 00:27:00.197]  The globalists stir up and start all these wars with nuclear powers.
[00:27:01.818 --> 00:27:08.360]  And then China's e-bullet out of control, grabbing a bunch of islands and attacking ships a thousand miles away from their coastline.
[00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.114]  Yeah, they claim a thousand miles in all directions off their coast.
[00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:15.156]  Islands that have never been theirs.
[00:27:15.656 --> 00:27:16.617]  In the Philippines.
[00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:19.340]  In Japan.
[00:27:20.421 --> 00:27:20.922]  To the north.
[00:27:22.123 --> 00:27:23.364]  In Vietnam.
[00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:27.989]  To the southwest of China's coast.
[00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:30.412]  Or just due south.
[00:27:34.239 --> 00:27:40.182]  It's anybody with an ounce of geopolitical acumen knows this is red flashing light.
[00:27:40.463 --> 00:27:40.963]  Danger!
[00:27:41.283 --> 00:27:42.464]  Danger, Will Robinson!
[00:27:42.524 --> 00:27:43.004]  Danger!
[00:27:47.526 --> 00:28:06.593]   I went and had dinner this weekend with my older children who are grown up and moved out with my parents and had my six-year-old darling there with me for my second wife and I wasn't even angry at the new old order I was disgusted with them and just Beyond angry.
[00:28:06.874 --> 00:28:16.020]  Just totally perplexed that I go out and see the general public and they know something's wrong, they just don't know how wrong it is.
[00:28:20.704 --> 00:28:38.207]   Now, all the moves we're seeing, and all the promotion of emergencies, for guns and borders and all this, And what they're doing to Trump, where the judge has come out and said in New York, I'm allowed to find people guilty.
[00:28:38.287 --> 00:28:39.108]  I don't need juries.
[00:28:39.128 --> 00:28:39.888]  I have a video.
[00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:43.131]  We'll play that towards the end of the hour.
[00:28:44.713 --> 00:28:45.293]  Got it right here.
[00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:49.797]  And I've got Trump saying, quote, I think it's very unfair.
[00:28:49.817 --> 00:28:50.978]  I don't have a jury.
[00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:53.120]  Where have I heard that before?
[00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:54.742]  My cases.
[00:28:56.294 --> 00:29:01.518]  And the same people that ran their operation against me have now filed suit against Elon Musk yesterday.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.982]  Starting to figure this out, folks.
[00:29:09.344 --> 00:29:14.128]  What does Alex Jones, Donald Trump, and Elon Musk have in common?
[00:29:14.228 --> 00:29:15.669]  We're opposing World War III.
[00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:18.892]  We're opposing total censorship.
[00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:21.480]  You know a man by his enemies.
[00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:23.261]  Musk is real.
[00:29:23.301 --> 00:29:24.502]  I'm not saying a perfect person.
[00:29:24.522 --> 00:29:30.247]  I don't completely trust him, but the New World Order is coming after him.
[00:29:30.987 --> 00:29:35.911]  We'll get to that today, but the clip, the video, Trump, I think it's very unfair.
[00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:37.052]  I don't have a jury.
[00:29:41.295 --> 00:29:49.882]  But also there's a statute of limitations and the judge said yesterday in court, I know it's going to be hard to get past it, but we're going to try.
[00:29:52.594 --> 00:29:55.236]  Oh, kind of like the statute of limitations on rape?
[00:29:57.757 --> 00:30:00.799]  And New York got rid of it just so they could sue Trump with no evidence?
[00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:04.342]  Same thing's happening to Russell Brand?
[00:30:05.582 --> 00:30:18.691]  So we have the judge talking to college students saying, if I'm emotional, which a judge is not supposed to be emotional, I just decide to not have a jury or I disregard juries when I'm emotional.
[00:30:20.942 --> 00:30:29.426]  Any judge that says, if I'm emotional, I'm gonna violate the law, would be disciplined and removed, would be impeached.
[00:30:30.227 --> 00:30:36.590]  But see, this is about hiking their leg like a dog, and pissing directly in our face, and telling us it's raining.
[00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.571]  You're like, why would they admit it?
[00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:43.394]  Headlines, Judge Finds Jones Guilty in Texas.
[00:30:44.454 --> 00:30:46.595]  Judge Finds Jones Guilty in Connecticut.
[00:30:48.196 --> 00:30:54.422]   See, when they don't have cases, They just find you guilty by default.
[00:30:55.342 --> 00:30:57.122]  But they don't even do that with Trump.
[00:30:57.682 --> 00:31:00.543]  They just say, Hey, I don't have a real estate license.
[00:31:00.703 --> 00:31:01.403]  I don't know anything.
[00:31:01.763 --> 00:31:03.643]  I'm a weirdo fruitcake judge.
[00:31:05.264 --> 00:31:07.484]  That looks like a Woody Allen nightmare.
[00:31:08.664 --> 00:31:09.825]  Woody Allen on steroids.
[00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:14.966]  Let's just say this.
[00:31:15.026 --> 00:31:16.826]  I'm not going to have the guy babysitting my kids.
[00:31:20.307 --> 00:31:21.267]  And this fruit ball.
[00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:27.682]  Says your Mar-a-Lago's worth $18 million.
[00:31:28.102 --> 00:31:29.023]  By the way, it's come out.
[00:31:30.064 --> 00:31:34.407]  Trump has been offered $500 million for Mar-a-Lago.
[00:31:37.009 --> 00:31:39.010]  I talked to a very wealthy man yesterday.
[00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:41.112]  Household name, a billionaire.
[00:31:42.212 --> 00:31:45.194]  And he said, I'll buy Mar-a-Lago tomorrow for $500 million.
[00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:49.117]  But it's in the news that there's been offers.
[00:31:49.497 --> 00:31:52.399]  It doesn't matter that that, in a market, shows the value.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.100]  No.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.723]  The judge has bozo-the-hair clown hair.
[00:31:58.923 --> 00:32:00.324]  So, he's a liberal.
[00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:02.786]  He's God.
[00:32:05.567 --> 00:32:06.768]  And it's the same attitude of Biden.
[00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:08.489]  Hey, we want to start World War III?
[00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:09.310]  We're going to do it.
[00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.111]  It's the same attitude of Sean Penn.
[00:32:11.491 --> 00:32:14.113]  Hey, we shouldn't be not talking about nuclear war and taking it off the table.
[00:32:14.413 --> 00:32:15.994]  Nuclear war is very survivable.
[00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:17.675]  Want to see the clip again?
[00:32:17.795 --> 00:32:18.275]  Want to hear it?
[00:32:19.696 --> 00:32:25.040]  And anybody listening to that, a 10-year-old goes, nuclear war is not survivable for almost everybody.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:25.741]  It's horrible.
[00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:28.203]  It's the greatest crime in history if it happens.
[00:32:28.743 --> 00:32:35.048]  Well, you're not Sean Penn, an idiot Hollywood buffoon.
[00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.231]  So these are crazy people.
[00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:49.752]  And the judge gets up and says, "I don't need juries."
[00:32:49.752 --> 00:32:59.751]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:32:52.188 --> 00:32:56.130]  He doesn't even need to say Trump didn't give him discovery, because Trump did.
[00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:18.945]   He just says, I don't call it a default, I don't call it anything, I'm just going to pull it out of my butt, right out of that rat's nest on top of his head, and I'm just going to find you guilty because I am your master.
[00:33:19.485 --> 00:33:20.446]  I am your king.
[00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:21.726]  I am your overlord.
[00:33:21.746 --> 00:33:29.788]  I said I'd get to the Tucker News, but I am just... I've never felt like this until lately.
[00:33:29.808 --> 00:33:34.290]  It's a feeling... I don't know how to describe this feeling.
[00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.510]  It is... I'm sure you're feeling the same way.
[00:33:36.329 --> 00:33:38.329]  It's apoplectic.
[00:33:38.329 --> 00:33:47.629]   It's like when I saw that footage ten years ago of the men on bath salts and
[00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:52.269]   they zoom in from a helicopter and he's bitten his nose off and his eyeballs out
[00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:57.548]   and the guy's got an eyeball hanging out of his mouth and you just look at it and it's like that's not real.
[00:33:57.894 --> 00:34:05.719]  Like the footage last week in Florida of a giant 15-foot alligator just eats a person on the side of the street and is dragging half the body along.
[00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:06.920]  It's already eaten half the person.
[00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:09.161]  And the police go and shoot it.
[00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:13.323]  And you're like, looking at an alligator eat somebody, and it's just like, what the?
[00:34:13.623 --> 00:34:20.623]  It's just so weird.
[00:34:20.623 --> 00:34:24.342]   Or it's like watching politicians, this happens around the world, blow their head off on TV.
[00:34:24.926 --> 00:34:29.007]  Or a Buddhist monk light themselves on fire in Vietnam, protesting the war.
[00:34:30.027 --> 00:34:31.408]  It's just like, whoa.
[00:34:32.168 --> 00:34:35.109]  But see, this isn't a Buddhist monk lighting themselves on fire.
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:43.872]  This is the New World Order pouring gasoline all over all of us, and then they've got the matches out, and they go, and now I'm gonna light us all on fire.
[00:34:44.132 --> 00:34:44.772]  How's that sound?
[00:34:44.973 --> 00:34:47.114]  And you're like, uh, why would you do that?
[00:34:47.134 --> 00:34:48.795]  Because I'm a devil worshipper.
[00:34:49.175 --> 00:34:50.696]  That's why I've got power.
[00:34:52.618 --> 00:34:54.199]  I'm a nihilistic person.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:06.679]   It's in my film, Endgame, quotes of some of the top globalist high priests at the WEF saying things like, We may just blow the whole planet up just to exercise our power.
[00:35:07.279 --> 00:35:10.141]  That's how we go on willing, and our will's all powerful.
[00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:16.066]  So we're making the decision right now on whether we should even just kill ourselves and blow everything up.
[00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.868]  And you're like, well that's not your right to do that.
[00:35:18.888 --> 00:35:19.749]  They're like, oh yeah?
[00:35:20.029 --> 00:35:20.669]  Watch this.
[00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.391]  I'm the most powerful person in history!
[00:35:23.952 --> 00:35:26.174]  I'm going to blow the planet up!
[00:35:28.155 --> 00:35:30.417]  And two men can have a baby, and families are bad.
[00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:41.537]  They hate themselves so much at a deep core level that they project it onto the world.
[00:35:41.817 --> 00:35:42.778]  I love myself.
[00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:43.959]  I like myself.
[00:35:44.299 --> 00:35:45.140]  I like you.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.121]  I like my family.
[00:35:46.421 --> 00:35:47.282]  I like to have fun.
[00:35:47.302 --> 00:35:54.128]  I had a big old plate of beef and cheese enchiladas last night.
[00:35:54.327 --> 00:36:04.327]  It never gets old.
[00:36:04.327 --> 00:36:10.807]   I cooked up bacon and eggs for my daughter this morning and sliced up, took a pear and peeled it for her and sliced it
[00:36:10.807 --> 00:36:16.327]   all up for her perfectly and just never gets old sitting there watching her enjoy herself.
[00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:17.071]  Never gets old.
[00:36:18.632 --> 00:36:21.934]  But see, these sickos don't like that.
[00:36:22.274 --> 00:36:24.455]  They see a child and they want to gouge her eyeballs out.
[00:36:26.377 --> 00:36:32.059]  Because that innocence and that goodness reminds them how rotten they are compared to it, so they want to stamp it out.
[00:36:32.439 --> 00:36:35.601]  And until you understand that, you don't understand anything.
[00:36:36.321 --> 00:36:46.425]  Because you are fallen and a sinner, but you love God, you love justice, you love a sunset, you love the beauty of the universe God gave us, you love children, you love the truth.
[00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:51.067]  You have to understand, these people don't want you to exist.
[00:36:51.327 --> 00:36:54.188]  They want to kill themselves, but take us with them.
[00:36:57.611 --> 00:37:00.353]  Suicide by cop didn't really exist until the last 50 years.
[00:37:00.594 --> 00:37:05.978]  And the more it happens, people are like, I'm not going to just kill myself, I'm going to go kill some cops and have them kill me at the same time.
[00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:18.109]  Or, hey, they advertise it, you're a psychotic demon, I'm going to go, not me, in their voice, I'm going to go out and I'm going to attack a school and shoot a bunch of kids and take a bunch of them with me.
[00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:25.095]  Because I'm so hateful and so depressed and so dark that you go into a church and you shoot a bunch of little kids.
[00:37:27.694 --> 00:37:35.037]  And you look at that woman that thought she was a man in Tennessee, and the video of her horrified, demonic face looks like a plastic mask.
[00:37:35.817 --> 00:37:37.177]  It's so haunting.
[00:37:39.658 --> 00:37:49.462]  Crying while she murdered the children, but something in her, being brainwashed by the left, being drugged up by the psychiatrist, was sitting there to murder little children!
[00:37:49.482 --> 00:37:51.723]  And you say, why would they do that?
[00:37:54.284 --> 00:37:55.004]  Yeah, look at that face.
[00:37:56.482 --> 00:37:58.264]  That's the face of the devil right there.
[00:38:00.165 --> 00:38:01.026]  Look at those eyes.
[00:38:01.086 --> 00:38:01.867]  Look at that mouth.
[00:38:03.608 --> 00:38:05.010]  Setting that grimace.
[00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:08.232]  They won't let you see the manifesto.
[00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:10.494]  You know what it says.
[00:38:13.477 --> 00:38:14.998]  That's one of their soldiers.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.099]  And if we don't stop them, they're gonna blow it all up.
[00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:36.599]   And the good news is, a lot of serious people that didn't wanna get involved in all this
[00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:41.778]   'cause they just thought they'd keep their heads down now realize you don't keep your head down
[00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:43.860]  with something like this.
[00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:45.341]  No, sir.
[00:38:46.381 --> 00:38:51.602]  You march straight into this thing 110% and that's the only way God's going to get us through it.
[00:38:52.022 --> 00:38:53.622]  God hates cowards.
[00:38:54.342 --> 00:38:55.923]  God hates cowards.
[00:38:56.423 --> 00:38:58.423]  God hates people that are lukewarm.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:05.522]  God hates you, but respects you when you serve evil because you've chosen a side.
[00:39:05.782 --> 00:39:06.402]  That's in the Bible.
[00:39:07.622 --> 00:39:11.563]  And God loves you and respects you when you join God and have courage.
[00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:16.645]  You were hot nor cold, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:39:16.705 --> 00:39:18.126]  You were lukewarm.
[00:39:18.706 --> 00:39:20.046]  You were riding the fence.
[00:39:21.106 --> 00:39:34.836]   And all you fence-sitters I see these strong, handsome, articulate men that go out and make money in business and think they're winning by playing the game in the system and never making a political move or never making a spiritual move.
[00:39:35.216 --> 00:39:36.537]  Basically, you don't even exist.
[00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:40.941]  And you are going to destroy your children's future.
[00:39:42.602 --> 00:39:46.225]  But you sit there on the sideline because you're a coward.
[00:39:46.546 --> 00:39:56.574]   And I want you to know, those of you that know the truth, that sit on the sidelines that God hates you more than the
[00:39:56.574 --> 00:39:56.963]  devil.
[00:39:56.963 --> 00:40:06.802]  God hates people that are lukewarm.
[00:40:07.047 --> 00:40:08.208]  God hates cowards.
[00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:11.508]  And God loves people that have courage.
[00:40:12.789 --> 00:40:14.669]  God loves people that have will for good.
[00:40:15.789 --> 00:40:18.910]  And God will open up the universe to you and give you discernment.
[00:40:19.957 --> 00:40:21.678]  We'll give you advanced intelligence.
[00:40:22.759 --> 00:40:25.641]  But, warning, it's very painful.
[00:40:25.801 --> 00:40:28.943]  The Bible says, sorrow comes.
[00:40:29.463 --> 00:40:30.724]  Pull up the exact quote for me.
[00:40:31.925 --> 00:40:33.406]  With knowledge comes sorrow.
[00:40:33.486 --> 00:40:35.167]  With great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[00:40:35.487 --> 00:40:37.048]  The beginning of wisdom is sorrow.
[00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:40.030]  There's five or six passages of the Bible I know of.
[00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.273]  But the most important one is, the beginning of wisdom is sorrow.
[00:40:45.438 --> 00:40:49.741]  That's why Tucker Carlson, who's got God now, saw the light three years ago.
[00:40:51.002 --> 00:40:52.563]  And I'm not going to tell you the personal story.
[00:40:52.623 --> 00:40:53.184]  It's amazing.
[00:40:53.764 --> 00:40:54.845]  Someday he probably will.
[00:40:56.446 --> 00:40:59.028]  And it reminds me of that Hank Williams song.
[00:40:59.148 --> 00:41:00.569]  I want to go out to it in eight minutes.
[00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:01.070]  We've got a break.
[00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:02.531]  Last minute.
[00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:04.732]  I saw the light.
[00:41:04.852 --> 00:41:06.354]  I saw the light.
[00:41:06.814 --> 00:41:08.335]  No more sorrow.
[00:41:08.435 --> 00:41:08.775]  No more.
[00:41:09.416 --> 00:41:11.077]  Because that's what you got to see.
[00:41:11.738 --> 00:41:14.800]  One thing is going to beat this, and that's us seeing the light.
[00:41:15.981 --> 00:41:17.802]  And when you see the light, you're going to see all your sins.
[00:41:17.822 --> 00:41:19.643]  You're going to be embarrassed in God's presence.
[00:41:20.024 --> 00:41:21.705]  You're going to want to stop doing those things.
[00:41:22.425 --> 00:41:23.666]  Sometimes you're going to backslide.
[00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:39.597]  Sometimes I catch myself being prideful, and that Luciferian energy bubbling up, and I'm going to get these people, and I got a plan, and I could really do some real havoc with them, brush them aside, but I'd have to use the dark side to get there.
[00:41:41.038 --> 00:41:41.798]  Black magic.
[00:41:41.818 --> 00:41:44.640]  And that doesn't mean sitting around some pentagon conjuring demons.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.001]  It means using the knowledge of evil and systems of deception.
[00:41:48.141 --> 00:41:51.103]  I will not use the Ring of Mordor.
[00:41:52.403 --> 00:41:53.364]  I won't look at it.
[00:41:53.384 --> 00:41:54.424]  I won't touch it.
[00:41:54.744 --> 00:41:56.105]  I won't read the writing on it.
[00:41:56.525 --> 00:41:57.465]  Get it away from me!
[00:41:59.906 --> 00:42:03.788]  Because you cannot use satanic energy to battle satanic energy.
[00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:07.130]  It'll look like it's winning in the first battle.
[00:42:08.086 --> 00:42:10.948]  But it will conjure up something a thousand times worse.
[00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:26.401]  There's a big article out yesterday, a couple days ago actually, in the Washington Post.
[00:42:27.674 --> 00:42:29.396]  Anti-Semitism is resurgent.
[00:42:29.836 --> 00:42:31.117]  We need a golem.
[00:42:31.538 --> 00:42:38.104]  And it calls for the conjuring of a Kabbalistic demon to attack Donald Trump and his supporters.
[00:42:40.206 --> 00:42:50.576]  Now, it came on the WikiLeaks that most of the Democrats follow Aleister Crowley or a black magic version of Kabbalah, which is all the same stuff.
[00:42:50.596 --> 00:42:51.417]  It goes back to Egypt.
[00:42:52.608 --> 00:42:57.634]  So Jewish black magic mysticism is the same as the grand grimoires and western black magic.
[00:42:57.694 --> 00:42:59.155]  It's all the exact same crap.
[00:43:01.158 --> 00:43:04.581]  And this calls for conjuring demons.
[00:43:05.442 --> 00:43:08.766]  And you go to Target, they got like dozens of books for kids to learn how to conjure demons.
[00:43:09.487 --> 00:43:18.889]   To use their will to open an interdimensional gate and summon Dark angels, black angels, to attack us.
[00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.489]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.831]  See, they're showing you who they are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:27.533]  Now, you know the rule about black magic, and it's in the Bible, and it's true.
[00:43:31.294 --> 00:43:33.936]  A lot of times, unless somebody's got Christ and is protected, it'll work.
[00:43:34.756 --> 00:43:38.578]  That's why a lot of people find Christ who didn't find it before, because they've sent these at people.
[00:43:39.978 --> 00:43:41.919]  Then people find Christ, and they didn't have protection.
[00:43:42.179 --> 00:43:43.440]  That'll get you religion real quick.
[00:43:46.288 --> 00:43:49.151]  This happened to some very prominent people that now have seen the light.
[00:43:51.092 --> 00:43:54.015]  Because the enemy sent these to attack them.
[00:43:55.356 --> 00:43:56.817]  In many cases they see them.
[00:43:58.399 --> 00:43:58.859]  Oh yes.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.723]  But do you know what happens to the people that send these at people?
[00:44:06.125 --> 00:44:08.127]  Their kids die in a car wreck a week later.
[00:44:08.427 --> 00:44:09.849]  Or they get cancer a month later.
[00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:13.512]  You do this, you've got to pay the piper.
[00:44:16.826 --> 00:44:41.442]   I forget that 1970s or 60s movie Sinbad the Sailor and there's the evil magician following Sinbad trying to get the secret amulet or whatever and he keeps cutting himself and doing rituals and creating demons after Sinbad and he was a young man at the beginning but only three times has he summoned a demon and by the end he's like an ancient 150 year old man and what does it tell you in Star Wars when Palpatine Becomes the Emperor.
[00:44:41.883 --> 00:44:46.004]  And he fights Mace Windu and he becomes this old, mutated, scarred person.
[00:44:46.805 --> 00:44:48.565]  Because he's using black magic, folks.
[00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:49.286]  It's the archetype.
[00:44:49.326 --> 00:44:52.627]  It's blowing back on him worse than he put on them.
[00:44:53.127 --> 00:44:53.367]  No.
[00:44:54.548 --> 00:44:56.969]  I reject all forms of black magic.
[00:44:57.949 --> 00:45:00.210]  The Washington Post endorses black magic.
[00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:21.732]   And Jeff Bezos, that owns the Washington Post, should know that God will hold him responsible for allowing People to organize in mass to call with spiritual energy and will to send demonic energy at people that that will come back on Jeff Bezos seven-fold!
[00:45:23.814 --> 00:45:25.075]  Seven-fold!
[00:45:27.277 --> 00:45:28.699]  So remember that Jeff Bezos!
[00:45:32.179 --> 00:45:45.450]  Now, Satanists believe if they kill a bunch of kids and things, they can push the destruction of them and they do rituals, like at Bohemian Grove, where it's a two-hour ritual about putting all of the bad mojo onto an effigy of a child they're killing.
[00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.172]  And they believe they can contain it for one more year.
[00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.733]  These people are insane.
[00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:55.478]  Here's the headline.
[00:45:57.019 --> 00:45:59.521]  Anti-Semitism is resurgent.
[00:45:59.561 --> 00:46:00.502]  We need a golem.
[00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.653]  Time to summon a 10-foot-tall crisis monster.
[00:46:07.614 --> 00:46:15.480]  And then it goes in to summoning demons.
[00:46:18.903 --> 00:46:19.923]  And what's in the WikiLeaks?
[00:46:21.204 --> 00:46:22.425]  Oh, we're going to meet with Podesta.
[00:46:22.445 --> 00:46:22.765]  We gotta meet.
[00:46:23.126 --> 00:46:24.647]  Oh, things are getting really dark.
[00:46:24.687 --> 00:46:25.708]  Bad things are happening to our family.
[00:46:26.068 --> 00:46:27.189]  We've got to do a ritual.
[00:46:30.404 --> 00:46:32.284]  The Lima and all this garbage.
[00:46:33.865 --> 00:46:34.565]  We're going to go to break.
[00:46:35.505 --> 00:46:43.447]  I'm going to get into the Tucker Carlson and saying they're probably going to try to remove Biden and Trump and cast the election.
[00:46:43.487 --> 00:46:44.167]  I totally agree with him.
[00:46:44.187 --> 00:46:46.387]  I got the Jack Posobiec clip as well.
[00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:49.008]  We're going to play both of them coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:46:50.388 --> 00:46:51.809]  I'm almost out of time right now.
[00:46:53.229 --> 00:46:54.689]  And I can't really do this justice.
[00:46:54.989 --> 00:46:57.610]  It starts shipping on the 20th of this month.
[00:46:59.189 --> 00:47:00.790]  You can get signed and unsigned copies.
[00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:03.571]  They're now in our warehouse, but we can't contractually ship them in.
[00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:05.212]  It officially comes out on the 24th.
[00:47:05.352 --> 00:47:06.873]  It's my second book.
[00:47:06.893 --> 00:47:09.254]  You can see it's a lot thicker than the last one.
[00:47:09.274 --> 00:47:10.175]  The last one was excellent.
[00:47:10.655 --> 00:47:11.416]  The Great Reset.
[00:47:12.236 --> 00:47:13.477]  And now we have The Great Awakening.
[00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:16.338]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:47:16.418 --> 00:47:19.480]  Alex Jones with Kent Heckenly doing the great research.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.061]  Forward by Stephen K. Bannon.
[00:47:22.582 --> 00:47:22.942]  On the back.
[00:47:24.272 --> 00:47:24.932]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:32.194]  Alex Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he's been a far better guide to reality in recent years.
[00:47:32.234 --> 00:47:34.975]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News.
[00:47:35.595 --> 00:47:36.096]  Bill Maher.
[00:47:36.596 --> 00:47:37.576]  Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:47:37.596 --> 00:47:38.416]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:47:39.717 --> 00:47:40.277]  Joe Rogan.
[00:47:40.377 --> 00:47:45.678]  Alex Jones is one of the most misunderstood people in the world, and he's been right about a lot of S-H-D.
[00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:47.819]  Stephen K. Bannon.
[00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:55.103]   For more than 20 years, no populist figure Has had more of a bayonet in the back of the deep state than Alex Jones.
[00:47:55.784 --> 00:47:57.686]  The books are now available for your pre-order.
[00:47:57.967 --> 00:47:59.629]  Get them first, signed and unsigned.
[00:47:59.909 --> 00:48:01.051]  The signed is a fundraiser.
[00:48:01.832 --> 00:48:03.133]  It's a regular price for the unsigned.
[00:48:03.153 --> 00:48:04.695]  I appreciate all of your support.
[00:48:05.196 --> 00:48:06.758]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:48:07.019 --> 00:48:09.579]  We go out with Hank Williams and I saw the light.
[00:48:09.579 --> 00:48:26.538]  I've not been this excited ever!
[00:48:26.538 --> 00:48:29.898]  Woo! Yeah, Mud Club, baby! Wow!
[00:48:30.053 --> 00:48:32.674]  The replatforming begins now.
[00:48:32.774 --> 00:48:49.404]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on.
[00:48:49.644 --> 00:48:51.005]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:48:51.025 --> 00:48:52.926]  It's like our information is game-changing.
[00:48:52.946 --> 00:48:54.207]  These products are incredible.
[00:48:55.167 --> 00:48:57.729]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:13.099]   All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get 3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:17.602]  I think we've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:49:18.623 --> 00:49:22.546]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:25.108]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD.
[00:49:25.889 --> 00:49:28.951]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:49:30.052 --> 00:49:36.657]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:49:41.328 --> 00:49:52.333]  And the risk of these vaccines that have now been given to literally billions of people in the sense of global use of the vaccine is really quite safe.
[00:49:52.753 --> 00:49:55.714]  So we know myocarditis with COVID is very rare.
[00:49:55.734 --> 00:50:00.776]  And then with the vaccines, there was an explosion of myocarditis.
[00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:02.897]  Thousands of cases reported to the CDC.
[00:50:03.707 --> 00:50:12.940]  Fatal cases, paper by Hoescher and colleagues, I'm the senior author, shows autopsy proven fatal cases of myocarditis never happened with COVID.
[00:50:13.401 --> 00:50:19.189]  So Fauci again is misleading the public trying to downplay COVID vaccine myocarditis.
[00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:19.789]  It's a killer.
[00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:36.378]  In a new letter, Oversight Committee Republican Brad Wenstrup claims that quote, information provided suggests that Dr. Fauci was escorted into Central Intelligence Agency headquarters without a record of entry and participated in the analysis to influence the agency's review of the origins of COVID-19.
[00:50:36.418 --> 00:51:09.677]   Congressional subpoenas and documents that have come in as they dig in to gain a function in the COVID response and myocarditis and blood clots and Infertility that has come out that Fauci quarterbacked and commanded with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment via the CIA the worldwide disinformation response that COVID didn't come out of the lab and then later that the shots worked and then quarterbacking censorship through the intelligence agencies of the world and then through big tech.
[00:51:10.638 --> 00:51:12.219]  Now this is coming out in Congress.
[00:51:13.604 --> 00:51:22.350]  And it's a big, big deal that they specifically knew that it was causing massive heart attacks, blood clots, strokes, myocarditis.
[00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:30.756]  Double vaxxed, booster, flu shot, and I'm gonna be honest, I have the shingle shot too.
[00:51:31.557 --> 00:51:32.598]  Never got COVID.
[00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:35.560]  Clearly, Jesus loves me the most.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.560]  Seriously.
[00:51:38.122 --> 00:51:38.882]  So nice.
[00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:39.803]  So nice!
[00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:49.854]  And that half of those that developed this type of myocarditis would be dead within ten years.
[00:51:50.735 --> 00:51:51.775]  Most of them within five.
[00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:53.157]  And they had these meetings.
[00:51:54.161 --> 00:51:57.424]  Yeah, well this is a situation where the whistleblower actually came to us.
[00:51:57.925 --> 00:52:03.450]  This whistleblower works at the CIA, was a high-level employee there, had been there for many years.
[00:52:03.851 --> 00:52:12.079]  He reached out to our intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, and then he also reached out to the select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.964]  The CIA put together a team called the COVID Discovery Team.
[00:52:17.524 --> 00:52:21.086]  And this team consisted of seven people with scientific backgrounds.
[00:52:21.787 --> 00:52:30.311]  Six of the seven at the end of the day came forward and they said with some confidence that they felt that COVID originated from a lab, a lab in China.
[00:52:30.952 --> 00:52:33.273]  The lead person felt that it came from nature.
[00:52:33.713 --> 00:52:49.563]  What he is alleging is that also, with some monetary compensation, their minds were changed, if you will, and they went from leaning towards the lab, but coming out and saying that the CIA was unable to determine where this came from.
[00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:52.764]  The big question in all this is why?
[00:52:52.904 --> 00:52:55.286]  Why would this take place at all?
[00:52:55.566 --> 00:53:03.137]  We were actually trading China advanced biotechnology for access to collect intelligence on their bioweapons laboratory.
[00:53:03.157 --> 00:53:06.922]  Including Dr. Peter Daszak telling me that he's working with the CIA.
[00:53:07.443 --> 00:53:11.108]  So Dr. Peter Daszak was working with the CIA, is that what you just said?
[00:53:12.284 --> 00:53:12.644]  Correct!
[00:53:13.145 --> 00:53:17.970]  And even people in the CIA, and this is coming out, said this is illegal, what we're doing.
[00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:33.687]  Now, look, people don't seem to care when I tell you about something after it happens, but if you're a new viewer, I've probably said in the last three and a half years that the CIA is running all this with the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundation about 2,000 times, conservatively.
[00:53:34.608 --> 00:53:36.289]  Fauci's above the CIA.
[00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:41.611]  He's a Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Rockefeller Foundation, eugenics leader.
[00:53:42.291 --> 00:53:52.395]  Those are the top foundations that put the people through college, put them in their foundations, then put them in regulatory agencies, and put them back in the foundations, and then start putting them in big pharma.
[00:53:52.415 --> 00:54:02.781]   That's why all of the FDA board members Our former board members or presidents or heads of the board of Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, Bayer, AstraZeneca.
[00:54:02.801 --> 00:54:04.162]  I mean, every damn one of them.
[00:54:04.602 --> 00:54:09.925]  But the people at the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment level, they know what's going on.
[00:54:09.965 --> 00:54:12.927]  Remember I told you decades ago, the Carnegie Endowment's at the top of the pyramid.
[00:54:13.107 --> 00:54:21.953]  And the rich people got together about 120 years ago, 125 years ago, and they said, let's take over society, take over medicine, set up a world government, then slowly poison everybody to death.
[00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:25.616]  And Hitler was like a false start for them, or a spinoff.
[00:54:26.576 --> 00:54:29.678]  It was like a trailer that didn't get the full season.
[00:54:30.479 --> 00:54:33.861]  But we're now experiencing the full production now.
[00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:38.363]  The fancy, slick, covert, camouflaged, crazy town.
[00:54:40.144 --> 00:54:41.245]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:41.285 --> 00:54:48.289]  Welcome to our number two of this Tuesday emergency broadcast, October 3rd, 2023.
[00:54:51.115 --> 00:54:58.240]  All right, let's dive right into what is coming up in the next three hours.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.323]  Now that we have three hours left, not four, we've completed the first hour.
[00:55:02.303 --> 00:55:12.391]  We have Professor Darren Beattie joining us, who is right in the middle of this whole Elon Musk situation.
[00:55:14.092 --> 00:55:17.275]  NBC News reporting, what was Musk's strategy for Twitter?
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.881]  And it was to defeat the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:55:20.921 --> 00:55:25.663]  That's coming out in the emails, and they think that it's Professor Beatty that he was talking to.
[00:55:26.944 --> 00:55:33.546]  Because it was Professor Beatty's article that was being shared with Musk, and Beatty has had no comment on that.
[00:55:34.287 --> 00:55:46.192]  But I can tell you behind the scenes, what I told you months ago, Musk is now fully anti-New World Order, and fully anti-globalists.
[00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:54.402]  And Alex Jones 2.0, that's what he tells his lawyers, his friends, he lives right here in Austin, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:55:56.383 --> 00:56:07.722]   My close friends go out to dinner with him, go to his house, go to his factory, hang out with him late at night, and They've told me, I told you this months ago, they say Musk is more hardcore than you.
[00:56:07.822 --> 00:56:09.003]  He starts ranting.
[00:56:09.763 --> 00:56:14.465]  He's totally pissed off because his oldest firstborn son is getting ready to have his genitals cut off.
[00:56:15.886 --> 00:56:17.626]  He doesn't like being involved in World War III.
[00:56:18.427 --> 00:56:19.607]  The Feds are messing with him.
[00:56:20.568 --> 00:56:24.409]  And if it's an act, it's a really good act because he's doing a bunch of stuff that's hurting him.
[00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.771]  And I know about the brain chips, the driverless cars and all that.
[00:56:28.071 --> 00:56:29.472]  I'm not saying Musk is perfect.
[00:56:29.512 --> 00:56:30.012]  Far from it.
[00:56:30.552 --> 00:56:35.714]  But they are legitimately coming at me with a bunch of criminal investigations.
[00:56:36.274 --> 00:56:39.515]  The same group that sued me is suing him.
[00:56:41.476 --> 00:56:45.797]  Professor Darren Beatty will be joining us the first 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:56:45.837 --> 00:56:48.678]  Then I'll get into other news and right into the fourth as well.
[00:56:51.719 --> 00:57:04.872]   But before I hit the big Tucker Carlson, Jack Wastowicz, Alex Jones, Prediction that there's a very good chance, I'm saying it's definitive, that they're going to remove Trump and Biden by hook or crook.
[00:57:06.494 --> 00:57:08.376]  We'll have two completely different nominees.
[00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:09.397]  That's being prepared.
[00:57:09.417 --> 00:57:11.560]  You can see it if you're politically savvy.
[00:57:14.503 --> 00:57:16.225]  Or they may just completely cancel the election.
[00:57:19.864 --> 00:57:27.970]  And I concur with Posobiec and with Carlson, who are both very smart men amongst the smartest out there.
[00:57:29.011 --> 00:57:30.152]  And I concur with them.
[00:57:31.553 --> 00:57:34.655]  And it's not a horn toot to say that I've been saying this before them.
[00:57:35.235 --> 00:57:38.358]  They come to their own decisions and their own analysis.
[00:57:39.398 --> 00:57:42.601]  So that's coming up first here in a moment.
[00:57:43.749 --> 00:57:48.191]  The over-the-top video of Trump saying, I would shoot her like a jury, but I guess I don't get one.
[00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:49.291]  I think it's very unfair.
[00:57:49.311 --> 00:57:50.812]  I don't have a jury, close quote.
[00:57:51.712 --> 00:57:55.994]  And then the news, Trump's already lost his case.
[00:57:56.054 --> 00:57:57.915]  Like, that's a good thing that a judge did that.
[00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:00.276]  What happened to Giuliani?
[00:58:00.336 --> 00:58:03.117]  Judge said he was guilty before he went to trial.
[00:58:05.838 --> 00:58:08.139]  They're doing this everywhere, folks.
[00:58:09.875 --> 00:58:15.816]  You understand in Georgia they indicted him for a tweet saying the election was stolen and saying illegal aliens voted.
[00:58:16.156 --> 00:58:16.676]  They did.
[00:58:16.756 --> 00:58:18.277]  The state found thousands did.
[00:58:20.057 --> 00:58:32.779]  Trump's judge, we could call him that, is in a video saying, I disregard juries when I'm emotional and I don't need juries.
[00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:33.699]  That clip's coming up.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.560]  I mean, come on folks, this is over the top.
[00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:43.954]  Biden claims Elon Musk's ex has made it so Americans have no notion what news is or not.
[00:58:44.014 --> 00:58:46.835]  No, your incessant lying has discredited you.
[00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:58.202]  We'll also get into the incredible, there's so many footage of this, but the government helping and aiding people with kidnapped children, in many cases that are drugged.
[00:58:59.383 --> 00:59:01.204]  To unconsciousness, many of them die.
[00:59:01.684 --> 00:59:05.205]  I've got a stack of articles admitting that the drugging is killing a bunch of them, including babies.
[00:59:05.945 --> 00:59:06.906]  But that's okay.
[00:59:07.566 --> 00:59:08.126]  It's liberal.
[00:59:10.127 --> 00:59:22.011]  Also, we've got more and more politicians from Illinois, New Mexico, California, New York, Michigan, calling for the U.N.
[00:59:21.851 --> 00:59:34.490]  to occupy the US. Can't make that up.
[00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:37.033]  I have ABC News, NBC News, all on those.
[00:59:40.715 --> 00:59:43.357]  Just, I mean, you read these headlines, and I have videos of it.
[00:59:46.098 --> 00:59:52.862]  Oh, and the UN to deal with abuse of police, or police being abused in Chicago.
[00:59:52.882 --> 00:59:56.865]  Hey guys, I know you printed them for me, and I know it's here.
[01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:05.312]  But I've got repeats of the activists and the police over and over again.
[01:00:05.572 --> 01:00:10.893]  What I need is the Chicago Alderman calls for United Nations to intervene in Chicago.
[01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:11.933]  That's the article I want.
[01:00:13.214 --> 01:00:20.255]  I have the videos of the newscast, but I don't know if I'm going to have time to play the CBS and ABC newscast about we need U.N.
[01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:20.795]  troops here.
[01:00:22.216 --> 01:00:23.736]  Peacekeepers on the streets of Chicago.
[01:00:27.366 --> 01:00:28.887]  They don't just say this out of the air.
[01:00:29.427 --> 01:00:30.967]  They say it at speeches at the U.N.
[01:00:31.508 --> 01:00:34.629]   They're normalizing the U.N.' 's over your health care, the U.N.'
[01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:35.329]  's over everything.
[01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:40.631]  So just type in Chicago Alderman wants U.N.
[01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:41.952]  peacekeepers in Chicago.
[01:00:42.812 --> 01:00:43.532]  I want those articles.
[01:00:44.072 --> 01:00:46.393]  I'm sure it's here, I just can't keep track of it anymore.
[01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:53.356]  And we've got a lot more as well.
[01:00:54.196 --> 01:00:54.997]  A lot more.
[01:00:59.068 --> 01:00:59.848]  It's official.
[01:01:00.809 --> 01:01:05.010]  All the appliances in your house to be banned by the Biden administration.
[01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:11.553]  And report California looking to restrict and then ban classic cars.
[01:01:13.193 --> 01:01:14.094]  We did a breakdown of it.
[01:01:14.114 --> 01:01:17.335]  California probes classic car owners amid zero emission zone.
[01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:19.115]  Says they're going to ban their cars.
[01:01:20.016 --> 01:01:20.836]  Can't make that up.
[01:01:23.737 --> 01:01:25.578]  So that's the stuff we got here.
[01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:28.559]  And I'll get to every bit of it before the broadcast ends.
[01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:34.420]  I was about to hit the UN stuff and I don't know how I got the same article four times.
[01:01:35.521 --> 01:01:38.842]  So just get that, get that for me.
[01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.263]  And we've got it or I can just send it to you.
[01:01:41.423 --> 01:01:41.763]  It's fine.
[01:01:43.843 --> 01:01:44.844]  But I'm going to take a break right now.
[01:01:44.864 --> 01:01:45.544]  I'm a little upset.
[01:01:45.644 --> 01:01:46.584]  Not at the crew, not anybody.
[01:01:46.664 --> 01:01:59.889]  I just, when you start talking about World War III and it's already happening, it's not an act when I say that I'm so upset I can't continue.
[01:02:02.847 --> 01:02:09.134]  Because if you don't think it's a big deal that they are openly smuggling children in and the U.S.
[01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:17.302]  government's running it drugged out of their minds, then something's wrong with you.
[01:02:17.703 --> 01:02:18.984]  Because we're not stopping it.
[01:02:19.264 --> 01:02:20.946]  So that means we are guilty.
[01:02:23.128 --> 01:02:24.390]  Here's the headline, ABC News.
[01:02:26.232 --> 01:02:28.933]  Boykin asked the United Nations for help fighting Chicago violence.
[01:02:29.733 --> 01:02:30.314]  Asked for U.N.
[01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:31.194]  peacekeepers on the ground.
[01:02:31.534 --> 01:02:32.415]  He did it years ago.
[01:02:32.435 --> 01:02:33.375]  They've done it again.
[01:02:34.795 --> 01:02:35.096]  Thank you.
[01:02:36.036 --> 01:02:36.676]  That's coming up.
[01:02:40.018 --> 01:02:48.741]  And the reason I say I'm not ready to cover this Tucker Carlson thing yet is I've got hundreds of points I want to make and my brain clicks into a place where I can really give you the full import.
[01:02:50.362 --> 01:03:13.118]   And then I get so nauseated staring into the abyss that I am unable It's like two days after your grandma dies, and you've gone to see her dead body and hugged her one more time and touched her face, or your grandfather, and then you can't talk about it for a couple days.
[01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:15.459]  It's hundreds of times worse, because they were old.
[01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:16.360]  They had good lives.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.161]  They believed in Christ.
[01:03:18.701 --> 01:03:19.641]  We'll see them on the other side.
[01:03:20.121 --> 01:03:23.303]  This is our whole world about to be destroyed, and our children.
[01:03:24.574 --> 01:03:29.718]  And so it's hard to talk a few days after a family member dies about it, because it's so upsetting.
[01:03:29.798 --> 01:03:31.360]  You don't feel like you should talk about it.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.120]  It's so deep.
[01:03:32.481 --> 01:03:32.941]  You can't.
[01:03:32.981 --> 01:03:33.802]  It's so big.
[01:03:34.222 --> 01:03:38.666]  And that's a feeling I have all the time now, where it's almost sick to have a talk show about this.
[01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:47.033]  Like, people tune in, and I see them all over the web saying, I tuned in, and it's so scary, and that guy's so evil, he's such a... Skip the break.
[01:03:47.853 --> 01:03:48.294]  He's so...
[01:03:51.485 --> 01:03:52.105]  Horrible.
[01:03:52.366 --> 01:03:54.327]  The terrible things he says to scare us.
[01:03:54.547 --> 01:03:55.288]  He's the bad man.
[01:03:55.568 --> 01:03:56.648]  You're blaming the messenger.
[01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:58.189]  That's why I played that RFK Jr.
[01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.790]  clip on C-SPAN yesterday.
[01:04:00.651 --> 01:04:05.194]  Where the woman calls in and says, how dare you claim 5G gives people cancer?
[01:04:05.494 --> 01:04:09.337]  And how dare you say SSRI drugs are linked to suicide and mass murder?
[01:04:09.717 --> 01:04:14.040]  And how dare you say that Atrazine is bending our genders?
[01:04:16.616 --> 01:04:19.118]  That's scary and that's horrible to lie like that.
[01:04:19.578 --> 01:04:24.521]  And of course he goes, Ma'am, everything I just told you is on record.
[01:04:24.922 --> 01:04:26.082]  You could search engine it.
[01:04:26.142 --> 01:04:27.243]  It's not debated.
[01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:36.484]  It's not even questioned.
[01:04:36.484 --> 01:04:39.124]  And I get it.
[01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:51.828]  If almost every analyst says this is leading to nuclear war and the probability of it, if the war continues in Ukraine very soon, someone tunes into that and they think, well, that's just, no, that's the reality.
[01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.831]  They are coming to ban your gas-powered stoves.
[01:04:57.091 --> 01:05:01.234]  They are coming to ban any car from the 1970s back.
[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:05.851]  They are coming to try to chop your son's genitals off.
[01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:06.851]  They're doing it!
[01:05:07.352 --> 01:05:08.852]  And they're bragging how much money they're going to make.
[01:05:10.953 --> 01:05:12.754]  And so, I want to explain it to people.
[01:05:15.275 --> 01:05:16.996]  I get demonized, I get lied about everywhere.
[01:05:17.016 --> 01:05:22.378]  I guess it's the big comedy circuit now at the big comedy clubs around the country, including Austin.
[01:05:22.598 --> 01:05:26.100]  People tell me, they go to Joe Rogan's club, I've been there a few times, it's great, Joe's invited me.
[01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:27.795]  And others.
[01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:29.556]  And it's a big joke with a lot of the comedians.
[01:05:29.596 --> 01:05:32.298]  I was sent a few of them this week making fun of me.
[01:05:32.558 --> 01:05:36.001]  And imagine being Alex Jones and how horrible it is and how hate it is.
[01:05:36.321 --> 01:05:37.742]  Imagine dying in a nuclear war.
[01:05:39.343 --> 01:05:47.069]  Imagine being a one-year-old kid given fentanyl and smuggled across the Rio Grande and they die of an overdose and the Border Patrol doesn't even charge the people.
[01:05:49.431 --> 01:05:54.255]  See, I got a job to do to tell you what's going on because I respect you.
[01:05:55.495 --> 01:06:01.780]  And I think you're going to do something about it, speaking out, getting involved as best we can.
[01:06:03.222 --> 01:06:11.589]  So no, I don't care when I'm at the grocery store and some woman walks up to me and says, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:17.614]  Now, it used to happen every day when I went out in public.
[01:06:18.254 --> 01:06:19.755]  Now people have woken up to a certain extent.
[01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:23.779]  So the last year, maybe three times, but it happened again last week.
[01:06:25.202 --> 01:06:26.082]  I'm at the grocery store.
[01:06:26.142 --> 01:06:27.303]  My wife asked me to go get something.
[01:06:27.323 --> 01:06:27.783]  She forgot.
[01:06:28.343 --> 01:06:29.504]  She'd already gone to the grocery store.
[01:06:29.524 --> 01:06:30.624]  She says, oh, I forgot this.
[01:06:31.064 --> 01:06:31.684]  I go, I'll go.
[01:06:31.704 --> 01:06:33.305]  It's down the street.
[01:06:33.325 --> 01:06:38.027]  So I'm going there and I'm getting the pasta she forgot, or the pasta shells.
[01:06:38.047 --> 01:06:38.967]  She's going to make lasagna.
[01:06:40.488 --> 01:06:43.849]  And this woman walks right over to me, probably about a 70 year old woman.
[01:06:44.129 --> 01:06:47.330]  And she goes, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to show your face.
[01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:51.332]  A guy in Hawaii did that like 10 months ago, 11 months ago.
[01:06:51.352 --> 01:06:51.992]  I went to visit there.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.460]  One guy confronted me the whole time I was there.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.221]  He goes, I'm surprised you even show your face.
[01:06:58.901 --> 01:06:59.781]  And I shouldn't have been mean.
[01:06:59.961 --> 01:07:01.642]  That's why I'm not Christ.
[01:07:01.682 --> 01:07:02.302]  I'm far from it.
[01:07:02.362 --> 01:07:03.502]  I want to be Christ-like.
[01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:05.463]  I said, well, you're so ugly.
[01:07:05.483 --> 01:07:08.023]  I'm surprised you want to show your face.
[01:07:08.283 --> 01:07:09.964]  And I could tell the older guy, this guy was like 35, 40.
[01:07:10.204 --> 01:07:11.584]  His dad was like 70.
[01:07:12.464 --> 01:07:13.504]  His dad was kind of a big guy.
[01:07:13.524 --> 01:07:15.465]  And he goes, watch your mouth.
[01:07:16.965 --> 01:07:17.745]  And bowed up.
[01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:21.566]  And I went, hey, it's your son running this big, ugly, fat head.
[01:07:23.763 --> 01:07:25.964]  You're the one bowed up, get out of my space right now.
[01:07:26.224 --> 01:07:26.885]  I've told the story.
[01:07:28.226 --> 01:07:29.747]  I said, come on!
[01:07:30.127 --> 01:07:30.907]  And I shouldn't have done it.
[01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:33.629]  My wife's like, stop it, starts dragging me away.
[01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:39.872]  They were both big guys, but it's like, you want to tell me how to be ashamed to show my face?
[01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:41.353]  And you don't want my comeback?
[01:07:42.154 --> 01:07:44.295]  And I went ahead and said, you know, I can tell he's your son.
[01:07:44.615 --> 01:07:46.176]  He's ugly just like you.
[01:07:47.637 --> 01:07:49.018]  Now, I repented of that.
[01:07:50.882 --> 01:07:53.063]  But that's that nasty comeback there, you know?
[01:07:53.163 --> 01:07:53.703]  We're ready.
[01:07:54.763 --> 01:07:56.763]  I got a little wet.
[01:07:56.763 --> 01:08:03.323]  That's another story.
[01:08:03.323 --> 01:08:07.303]  [ Silence ]
[01:08:07.867 --> 01:08:09.948]  And this lady a couple years ago confronted me at a gas station.
[01:08:11.228 --> 01:08:12.929]  I forget exactly what she said, but it was a great comeback.
[01:08:12.949 --> 01:08:13.669]  It just popped in my head.
[01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:19.291]  She goes, you're a horrible person, you're this and that, you're an idiot, you're a traitor, blah blah blah.
[01:08:20.134 --> 01:08:21.095]  And then I didn't respond.
[01:08:22.236 --> 01:08:23.338]  She goes, why won't you respond?
[01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:24.219]  Why won't you respond?
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.341]  Why won't you say something back?
[01:08:26.381 --> 01:08:29.184]  And I went, because I'm against cruelty to animals.
[01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.648]  And she goes, what's that mean?
[01:08:33.089 --> 01:08:36.312]  And I said, I think sheep are wonderful creatures.
[01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:39.336]  I had that on video.
[01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:41.951]  Oh, I'm having a little fun.
[01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:50.575]  See, what I'm doing here is I'm dodging the nuclear war talk, because I really believe there's a 60% chance there'll be a major nuclear war in the next 12 months.
[01:08:52.416 --> 01:08:53.256]  That's the road we're going.
[01:08:53.296 --> 01:09:03.340]  It's like if you're driving on a road that ends in a cliff, and the cliff's 10 miles away, you can look at your watch, and you're going 60 miles an hour, and you know in so many minutes you're going to run off the edge of that cliff.
[01:09:06.163 --> 01:09:10.082]   So right now we're driving towards a cliff and we can look at our watch and say,
[01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:11.523]  "My watch is broken, it's at the shop."
[01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:18.483]  Can we kind of change direction here?
[01:09:18.644 --> 01:09:19.586]  Maybe go somewhere else?
[01:09:20.583 --> 01:09:22.004]  And that's really my frustration.
[01:09:22.344 --> 01:09:24.406]  We're smart enough to not destroy civilization.
[01:09:24.726 --> 01:09:36.314]  I know the globalists want control of civilization, and there's too many of us, and they can shut off civilization and then make us do whatever they say to get resources, and they'll get control for the greater good, but they're the ones destabilizing everything.
[01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:50.064]  We supposedly set up the League of Nations to stop the war, to end all wars, not have another one, then we have World War II, then we got the UN, we gotta have world government to stop nuclear war, we're told after World War II, and the very people doing that are handing out nuclear weapons like hotcakes.
[01:09:52.247 --> 01:09:53.788]  Like lollipops at the barbershop.
[01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:55.410]  Or the dentist.
[01:09:57.291 --> 01:10:00.394]  Remember you get your hair cut at the barbershop and your kid will give you a dum-dum?
[01:10:01.315 --> 01:10:02.436]  Little lollipop.
[01:10:03.557 --> 01:10:11.023]  They're handing out nuclear weapons plans and bioweapons plans like they're handing out speeding tickets to the ND500.
[01:10:11.183 --> 01:10:24.238]   And I just sit back and just go, that's... And then they're the ones, though, Oh, you don't pay all your income taxes to the private Federal Reserve?
[01:10:24.818 --> 01:10:29.320]  Well, we're going to take your house and throw you in jail because we're the mighty good government.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.421]  We're going to take care of everybody.
[01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:32.581]  We know what to do.
[01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:38.364]  Yeah, they brought me another headline here.
[01:10:38.384 --> 01:10:46.907]  Yeah, it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:10:46.947 --> 01:10:50.089]  Chicago County Commissioner calls for UN troops on the streets.
[01:10:51.018 --> 01:10:52.219]  But you know, everything's fine.
[01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:54.842]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[01:10:57.665 --> 01:10:58.566]  Because it makes me happy.
[01:11:01.089 --> 01:11:02.830]  I'm going to stop, pull myself together here.
[01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:06.254]  See, in the old days, I'd start yelling and screaming.
[01:11:06.975 --> 01:11:08.957]  But it takes too much of my energy.
[01:11:09.597 --> 01:11:18.706]   When I yell and scream and get mad on air, I'm exhausted after the show, and I got I gotta work till about 7 or 8 tonight to get everything done, and I'll have plenty of energy as long as I don't blow up.
[01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:20.327]  So I'm not gonna blow up.
[01:11:20.367 --> 01:11:24.951]  Even though it's entertaining and funny and cute, I'm not gonna do a Tasmanian Devil right here.
[01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:26.232]  Meet Yosemite Sam.
[01:11:27.513 --> 01:11:28.673]  I hate rabbits.
[01:11:29.874 --> 01:11:31.235]  I hate globalists.
[01:11:32.176 --> 01:11:41.523]  No, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna air a couple of videos, and then I'm gonna do what I said I'm gonna do.
[01:11:43.693 --> 01:11:53.259]  I am going to cover the World War III scenario, and the canceling of the election scenario, and I'm going to play these clips of Tucker Carlson and Jack Posobiec.
[01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.140]  In fact, that's the videos I'm going to play right now.
[01:11:57.861 --> 01:11:59.542]  Play the Tucker Carlson first.
[01:12:00.743 --> 01:12:02.064]  It's about five minutes long.
[01:12:03.464 --> 01:12:11.349]  And then we'll go to break, come back with Jack Posobiec, and then I will give you my analysis and my report that gives me a migraine headache.
[01:12:12.608 --> 01:12:15.851]  Because I really believe this, and I really see this, and this is horrible.
[01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:28.161]  And I don't like thinking there's a 60% chance they're gonna rain down ICBM, MIRV, multiple re-entry warheads on top of my ass, where I live in one of the main targets.
[01:12:30.282 --> 01:12:32.764]  And I've got courage, and I know my spirit goes on.
[01:12:33.165 --> 01:12:35.987]  And I know if my family gets killed, I'll meet them on the other side.
[01:12:36.587 --> 01:12:38.389]  But I still don't like it.
[01:12:40.751 --> 01:12:44.254]  And so, this isn't just something we just flippantly talk about.
[01:12:44.554 --> 01:12:45.515]  I think that's what it is.
[01:12:45.575 --> 01:12:50.118]  It's so horrible, that I have trouble saying it.
[01:12:51.339 --> 01:12:52.120]  Because I believe it.
[01:12:53.601 --> 01:12:58.205]  And you notice, in my 29 years on air, 95% of what I say happens.
[01:13:00.006 --> 01:13:02.068]  But we don't have to go down this road.
[01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:07.672]  It's like a 5 minute clip, we got 4 minutes to break.
[01:13:10.438 --> 01:13:12.500]  Let's start with a clip, we'll come back and finish.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.341]  Carlson, here it is.
[01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:28.696]  So, they've done everything they can, by legal means, which are in fact extra legal means, if we're being totally honest, completely third world stuff, to take the opponent out of the race, and they're still losing.
[01:13:30.521 --> 01:13:32.421]  So, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:35.882]  This is not going to be a race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
[01:13:36.462 --> 01:13:40.603]  I would bet my beloved fishing camp in Maine that that is not going to happen.
[01:13:40.663 --> 01:13:41.563]  That's not going to happen.
[01:13:42.103 --> 01:13:42.904]  So what will happen?
[01:13:42.984 --> 01:13:43.604]  Well, I don't know.
[01:13:44.564 --> 01:13:48.125]  One of like 400 distinct other possibilities?
[01:13:48.145 --> 01:13:49.585]  I mean, I just can't even, you know, pick one.
[01:13:50.245 --> 01:13:52.466]  By the way, if it's Gavin Newsom, we all should be very, very concerned.
[01:13:52.706 --> 01:13:53.666]  That guy's scary and I mean it.
[01:13:53.886 --> 01:13:54.566]  I mean that scary.
[01:13:56.035 --> 01:13:57.537]  Yeah, but that's a whole separate conversation.
[01:13:57.557 --> 01:14:01.401]  But the point is, this will be forced!
[01:14:01.781 --> 01:14:02.902]  These issues will be forced!
[01:14:03.923 --> 01:14:04.284]  Soon!
[01:14:04.484 --> 01:14:05.164]  Like in a year!
[01:14:06.626 --> 01:14:12.792]  And the road from here to November of 2024 is going to be filled with developments nobody in this room could foresee.
[01:14:12.932 --> 01:14:14.074]  I can promise you that.
[01:14:15.393 --> 01:14:18.694]  So it's about to get very serious, for sure.
[01:14:19.034 --> 01:14:27.655]  It's only leadership of the world at stake, which is also, by the way, we now know, the most lucrative possible political franchise in human history.
[01:14:28.676 --> 01:14:29.556]  So everything's at stake.
[01:14:29.596 --> 01:14:30.536]  What wouldn't they do?
[01:14:30.756 --> 01:14:31.616]  What haven't they done?
[01:14:32.336 --> 01:14:33.237]  What might they do next?
[01:14:33.297 --> 01:14:34.697]  Let your imagination run wild.
[01:14:34.717 --> 01:14:40.278]  So the question, the only one that you can answer is, how will you prepare yourself for that?
[01:14:41.841 --> 01:14:46.846]  And, because that really is the only question, and I mean, I just, my answers to that in my own life, I'll just tell you what I think.
[01:14:47.026 --> 01:14:48.287]  One, be a little bit more serious.
[01:14:49.848 --> 01:14:51.610]  You know, like, take this seriously.
[01:14:52.511 --> 01:14:55.594]  Much as you want to retreat and pretend, everything is fine, sit down.
[01:14:56.654 --> 01:14:57.155]  It's not fine.
[01:14:57.836 --> 01:14:58.056]  Okay?
[01:15:00.305 --> 01:15:12.334]  Two, you know, maybe if you look across at the people you despise, the small group of people running this country, and it is small, it does not represent most people in America, it doesn't represent anything close to a majority at all.
[01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:26.124]  Again, just to restate, Donald Trump, who is hated as a blood enemy by over 40% of the population, and who's been attacked in ways that no political figure's ever been attacked in the West, is beating the incumbent president, okay?
[01:15:27.382 --> 01:15:29.423]  I'm not sure that's entirely an endorsement of Trump.
[01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:30.283]  To some extent it is.
[01:15:30.503 --> 01:15:32.063]  And his empathy, that's real.
[01:15:32.863 --> 01:15:36.164]  But it's also a sign of revulsion.
[01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:38.985]  Deep dissatisfaction with what we're doing.
[01:15:39.025 --> 01:15:40.806]  So most people are not on board with this.
[01:15:42.206 --> 01:15:45.627]  But the people who are responsible for it are the most dishonest.
[01:15:45.647 --> 01:15:46.647]  Let's go to break and come back.
[01:15:47.347 --> 01:15:47.847]  Back it up.
[01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:49.768]  That's what I said.
[01:15:49.788 --> 01:15:51.248]  It's nausea.
[01:15:51.608 --> 01:15:53.709]  I mean, I'm actually, I have revulsion.
[01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:55.350]  It's not hate.
[01:15:55.410 --> 01:15:56.131]  It's beyond that.
[01:15:56.231 --> 01:15:57.371]  It is a revulsion.
[01:15:58.572 --> 01:16:00.132]  These people are revolting.
[01:16:00.152 --> 01:16:10.897]  A couple times when I worked for a large animal vet, he would go on vacation.
[01:16:10.937 --> 01:16:14.399]  He'd say, yeah, you're gonna work at this ranch for the next week.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.882]  And one time, they'd had some cows that got sick, died of something.
[01:16:21.222 --> 01:16:22.382]  Five or six of them rotting.
[01:16:22.402 --> 01:16:23.383]  They'd been dead about a week.
[01:16:25.285 --> 01:16:33.630]  And it was my job to tie a chain to him with a tractor and take him into a ditch and then use the scoop on the front, the bulldozer, to bury him.
[01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:37.232]  That's what I was told to do.
[01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:52.160]  And let me tell you something, when you're tying chains on the legs of big rotting cows and maggots are coming out everywhere and then a possum comes out of the ass of one of them, I saw that happen, I saw a possum come crawling out of the ass of a dead cow, you vomit.
[01:16:52.801 --> 01:16:56.282]  And you're ordered to do it, you're tough texting out there on the ranch, you do it.
[01:16:56.722 --> 01:16:58.882]  That is a one on a scale.
[01:16:59.142 --> 01:17:01.943]  My revulsion for Chuckie Schumer and Hillary Clinton is a 5,000.
[01:17:02.343 --> 01:17:04.804]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:17:05.757 --> 01:17:15.883]  So when you're dragging dead rotting cows around to bury them behind a tractor and they've been rotting too long, a whole leg will pull out.
[01:17:17.684 --> 01:17:18.725]  You got a job to do.
[01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:20.846]  She'd get off the tractor and you go back over.
[01:17:21.947 --> 01:17:23.548]  This time you tie it around its head.
[01:17:25.711 --> 01:17:28.152]  And then you get to see all the maggots and everything else.
[01:17:28.212 --> 01:17:29.132]  It's got a stench.
[01:17:29.733 --> 01:17:31.853]  It's something just unimaginable.
[01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:33.914]  That's farm work, folks.
[01:17:34.394 --> 01:17:35.495]  That's what built this country.
[01:17:36.215 --> 01:17:36.695]  That's nothing.
[01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:37.776]  I'm not the toughest guy around.
[01:17:38.356 --> 01:17:39.617]  My dad wanted to toughen me up.
[01:17:39.777 --> 01:17:41.117]  I was kicked out of high school for a year.
[01:17:41.137 --> 01:17:42.818]  I'd already worked during the summers for that guy.
[01:17:43.138 --> 01:17:44.498]  He said, you're out of school for a year.
[01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:45.059]  You go down there.
[01:17:45.079 --> 01:17:46.379]  And they were a family friend.
[01:17:46.699 --> 01:17:50.701]  They took me on to kick my ass and teach me how to be a man.
[01:17:52.947 --> 01:18:00.012]  But the revulsion, and I only had to haul dead animals around three or four times in a year, dead horse once, you name it.
[01:18:01.453 --> 01:18:05.916]  The revulsion to that, I don't tell that story to be gross, it's to give you a scale, is a one.
[01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:19.965]  And looking at Chuckie Schumer and Hillary Clinton and Marina Abranovich and John Podesta is a ten.
[01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:29.168]  And so Tucker Carlson talks about the revulsion of the people pushing us into the end of the world and nuclear war.
[01:18:29.508 --> 01:18:32.971]  That is a level of revulsion we should all have.
[01:18:33.031 --> 01:18:38.196]  These are revolting, disgusting, out-of-control people.
[01:18:40.698 --> 01:18:41.939]  And they're spiritually dead.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.741]  And they're rotting corpses.
[01:18:45.702 --> 01:18:47.524]  That's what they are, living dead, zombies.
[01:18:48.663 --> 01:18:54.668]  The undead are contaminating our society, and they're in control right now of the institutions.
[01:18:55.928 --> 01:19:00.952]  So let's go back to Carlson, then we'll go to Jack Posovic basically saying the same thing.
[01:19:01.012 --> 01:19:01.873]  I'll give you my analysis.
[01:19:03.014 --> 01:19:05.035]  It is, and his empathy, that's real.
[01:19:05.836 --> 01:19:11.960]  But it's also a sign of revulsion, deep dissatisfaction with what we're doing.
[01:19:12.001 --> 01:19:13.742]  So most people are not on board with this.
[01:19:15.162 --> 01:19:24.486]  But the people who are responsible for it are the most dishonest, the most ruthless, the most anti-human group I've ever dealt with.
[01:19:25.406 --> 01:19:27.187]  And I spent 35 years living in Washington.
[01:19:27.207 --> 01:19:30.288]  I don't even recognize these people and what they're doing.
[01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:30.848]  I really don't.
[01:19:30.968 --> 01:19:31.668]  It's so dark.
[01:19:32.109 --> 01:19:38.911]  They're doing things that can't even, on an academic level, conceivably help the United States or the population that lives here.
[01:19:39.331 --> 01:19:40.412]  Letting in 7 million people?
[01:19:41.348 --> 01:19:42.669]  From the poorest countries in the world?
[01:19:42.849 --> 01:19:43.330]  Illegally?
[01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:45.752]  And then immediately putting them all on public benefits?
[01:19:45.772 --> 01:19:47.453]  I mean, that right there will destroy the country.
[01:19:47.473 --> 01:19:48.434]  And they did that on purpose.
[01:19:49.495 --> 01:19:51.096]  So these are really, really dark people.
[01:19:51.637 --> 01:19:52.177]  The darkest.
[01:19:54.059 --> 01:19:55.800]  So, I need to be the opposite of that.
[01:19:56.921 --> 01:19:58.082]  And I'm not a super good person.
[01:19:58.102 --> 01:19:59.203]  The last thing I would do is claim to be.
[01:20:00.244 --> 01:20:03.947]  But, this is the moment to try a little harder to be a little bit better.
[01:20:04.287 --> 01:20:05.969]  This is not the moment to be drunk all the time.
[01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:08.411]  This is not the moment to tell lies.
[01:20:09.477 --> 01:20:11.920]  As they go lower, go higher.
[01:20:13.541 --> 01:20:14.682]  And there are many reasons for this.
[01:20:15.403 --> 01:20:17.345]  And one is spiritual, I'll just be totally honest.
[01:20:17.886 --> 01:20:19.267]  I do think this is a spiritual battle.
[01:20:19.287 --> 01:20:21.449]  There's no political explanation for it whatsoever.
[01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:28.457]  But one other reason is for the way that you feel about yourself.
[01:20:29.498 --> 01:20:32.461]  When you're honest, you are proud of yourself.
[01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:36.271]  When you're honest, you are strong.
[01:20:37.031 --> 01:20:38.973]  When you lie, you become weak.
[01:20:39.573 --> 01:20:40.114]  That is true.
[01:20:40.714 --> 01:20:42.716]  Tell a lie, you become weak.
[01:20:42.816 --> 01:20:43.396]  Why do you lie?
[01:20:43.436 --> 01:20:44.557]  Because you're hiding something.
[01:20:45.798 --> 01:20:51.363]  Because you believe that the people around you knew what you really thought or said or did, they would think less of you.
[01:20:53.785 --> 01:20:54.725]  That diminishes you.
[01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:56.887]  Your power ebbs when you lie.
[01:20:57.348 --> 01:20:58.348]  Tell the truth.
[01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:08.415]  We're going to play more of the speech coming up after Professor Darren Beattie leaves us with the Big Elon Musk News.
[01:21:08.455 --> 01:21:13.884]  But let's go ahead now and get to Jack Posobiec a few weeks on the show.
[01:21:13.904 --> 01:21:16.068]  Basically he's predicting the same thing.
[01:21:18.496 --> 01:21:32.319]  I think it's worse than people realize because I know you and you've done fantastic reporting on the reintroduction of COVID, this push to reintroduce COVID lockdowns, Jill Biden coming out today and saying that she has tested positive.
[01:21:32.379 --> 01:21:42.121]  You directly predicted through your TSA whistleblower that mid-September, and here we are September 5, that these introductions would begin to take place.
[01:21:42.681 --> 01:21:57.949]   However, Tucker Carlson also floated a new idea and that is Could they possibly push for full-scale war with Russia, a hot war with Russia, to essentially claim war powers?
[01:21:57.969 --> 01:22:05.093]  And we've already seen the normalization of this in Ukraine, where Ukraine has said, we will not hold elections because we are at wartime.
[01:22:06.645 --> 01:22:15.692]  Is that potentially setting the stage to normalize the idea of even the United States not being able to hold elections because we're in a hot war with Russia?
[01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:20.535]  Alex, the way I'm looking at things, that's exactly the way the dominoes are falling right now.
[01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:33.644]   They fall as a direct chain between the indictment of Trump, the attempts to remove Trump from the ballot, going after key Trump lieutenants, The trial of Bannon, Peter Navarro goes on trial today.
[01:22:33.944 --> 01:22:37.226]  The impeachment of Ken Paxton down in Texas is going on today.
[01:22:37.466 --> 01:22:39.327]  The Freedom Truckers, that's going on trial today.
[01:22:39.407 --> 01:22:49.612]  We are seeing full-spectrum legal warfare from the overstate, from the regime on the forces of populism today.
[01:22:49.952 --> 01:23:05.659]   And it's setting the stage so that any of these high-level dissidents, any powerful dissidents, whether they're going after you, Alex, whether they're going after me, so many others, Charlie Kirk, The reason that they're doing this is so that any voice of dissent will be taken out before this potentiality can come to pass.
[01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:13.984]  And if we let it gain critical mass, if we let it gain critical mass, then they will absolutely institute a hot war with Russia.
[01:23:14.024 --> 01:23:18.066]  And I tweeted this last week and I got a lot of pushback on it from the neocons in D.C.
[01:23:18.346 --> 01:23:27.270]   because not only would they want to go to a war with Russia for all those reasons, but But at the same time, who are the people most likely to go and serve, even if there was a draft or the volunteers?
[01:23:27.571 --> 01:23:34.774]  It would be people that are more likely to be conservative, more likely to be libertarian, more likely to be Trump supporters, more likely to be dissidents.
[01:23:34.794 --> 01:23:37.915]  They're going to be sending you guys all over to fight in Russia.
[01:23:37.935 --> 01:23:41.117]  It really hasn't hit the news in the West, but I saw it a few days ago and confirmed it.
[01:23:41.357 --> 01:23:45.699]  Ukraine is now drafting women into frontline combat.
[01:23:48.496 --> 01:23:49.678]  Fighting the last Ukrainian.
[01:23:50.379 --> 01:23:52.642]  I want to play a short clip of Klaus Schwab and I'll give you my breakdown.
[01:23:53.302 --> 01:23:55.025]  The latest info from my perspective.
[01:23:56.328 --> 01:24:02.912]  And we really should just open the phone calls up on World War III and cancel elections or removing Trump and Biden one way or the other and putting up new puppets.
[01:24:03.233 --> 01:24:03.833]  Who they'll be.
[01:24:03.953 --> 01:24:04.734]  You see the move.
[01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:07.936]  You see the deep state targeting Biden now to try to make him step down.
[01:24:08.296 --> 01:24:09.877]  Targeting Trump to try to make him back down.
[01:24:09.897 --> 01:24:14.420]  I mean, it's just, it's not a question of is Tucker Carlson and Jack Masovic right?
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.681]  It's a guaranteed.
[01:24:16.021 --> 01:24:18.103]  It's just exactly who are they planning to bring in?
[01:24:18.403 --> 01:24:20.104]  How are they planning to get rid of Trump and Biden?
[01:24:20.124 --> 01:24:25.908]  Because Biden thinks he's the president and he was installed there, but he and Jill are not backing down.
[01:24:26.929 --> 01:24:30.552]  So this is just crazy town, and you see that with evil groups at the top.
[01:24:31.073 --> 01:24:32.334]  They're always fighting with each other.
[01:24:32.574 --> 01:24:40.061]  They're always double-crossing each other historically over and over again, whether it was the Nazis and the Russians in World War II, or whether it was the Caesars in Rome.
[01:24:42.543 --> 01:24:43.284]  Humans are the same.
[01:24:43.304 --> 01:24:45.226]  We do the same stuff over and over again.
[01:24:45.486 --> 01:24:48.609]  We just have bigger, more destructive weapons to kill everybody now.
[01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.491]  That's the big game-changer.
[01:24:52.694 --> 01:24:56.415]  So here's Schwab, Klaus Schwab, who's just the mouthpiece of the New World Order.
[01:24:57.116 --> 01:24:58.416]  They say, who died and made him the boss?
[01:24:58.456 --> 01:24:59.877]  Well, he's the globalist frontman.
[01:25:00.157 --> 01:25:01.177]  He engaged in a few others.
[01:25:02.578 --> 01:25:03.698]  They're top generals in this.
[01:25:05.459 --> 01:25:06.679]  They're actually guys running things.
[01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:11.401]  They don't own it, like the BlackRock shareholders at the top, but they're the ones managing it.
[01:25:11.421 --> 01:25:12.101]  They're in charge.
[01:25:12.642 --> 01:25:15.843]  They're the imperial legates, as they're called, acting as the emperor.
[01:25:17.205 --> 01:25:21.867]  And they have committees, right down to just committees of 10 at the very top, that's confirmed.
[01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:24.968]  They have a committee of 300, that goes back 300 plus years.
[01:25:26.969 --> 01:25:31.571]  In England, the 300 years old doesn't have anything to do with the 300.
[01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:33.772]  It goes back to the British East India Company and a committee of 300.
[01:25:34.532 --> 01:25:41.135]  That model of roundtable groups, what the CFR is, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, look these things up.
[01:25:41.455 --> 01:25:45.157]  When I tell you something, look, write it down, look it up, and you'll be blown away.
[01:25:45.897 --> 01:25:46.097]  Okay?
[01:25:47.315 --> 01:26:00.926]  I'm not just spouting names and things here to sound proficient in politics and geopolitics and culture and anthropology and psychology and sociology and spirituality and mathematics and economic systems and things.
[01:26:00.986 --> 01:26:02.687]  I'm studying a full spectrum of it.
[01:26:03.788 --> 01:26:04.809]  So here's Schwab.
[01:26:04.929 --> 01:26:11.194]  What a profound statement with this high priest saying the future is not human, the human era is over.
[01:26:12.299 --> 01:26:13.603]  It's more intense every day.
[01:26:13.703 --> 01:26:14.986]  The human era's over.
[01:26:15.006 --> 01:26:17.071]  I mean, Hitler just said, I'm gonna kill certain groups.
[01:26:17.111 --> 01:26:17.693]  That was terrible.
[01:26:17.954 --> 01:26:19.437]  No, they're like, the human era's over.
[01:26:19.477 --> 01:26:20.219]  You're all done.
[01:26:21.561 --> 01:26:28.104]  Well, Klaus Schwab says, America won't be a superpower, there won't be any really nations anymore, it'll all be run by the stakeholders.
[01:26:28.825 --> 01:26:32.046]  That means the big, most powerful bankers, the biggest families.
[01:26:32.367 --> 01:26:33.647]  They're taking full control.
[01:26:33.827 --> 01:26:42.332]  But they've got to first have their politicians do terrible things and discredit themselves, while they wage war with people opposing them, and then they destroy us all together.
[01:26:43.793 --> 01:26:44.493]  Here's Klaus Schwab.
[01:26:45.919 --> 01:26:51.803]  Who will really command the 4th Industrial Revolution and its technology like Artificial Intelligence?
[01:26:51.923 --> 01:26:59.108]  What's your sense of who's best placed at this time to lead the world into the 4th Industrial Revolution?
[01:26:59.148 --> 01:27:01.090]  Because you pretty much created this term.
[01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:07.554]  We're seeing the kind of technological strides that China has made with the 5G technology.
[01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:11.537]  Do you believe that this could potentially be China's time once again?
[01:27:12.443 --> 01:27:18.909]  We should make here again, let's say, a differentiation.
[01:27:18.989 --> 01:27:23.253]  On the one hand, we have state capitalism.
[01:27:23.994 --> 01:27:27.677]  On the other hand, we have shareholder or private capitalism.
[01:27:27.757 --> 01:27:30.079]  So it's a clash between two systems.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:49.287]  I believe that state capitalism in the short term provides certain advantages because you can mobilize in a concentrated way a lot of resources to reach a specific objective.
[01:27:49.907 --> 01:27:55.751]  But I believe that the future is not state capitalism or shareholder capitalism.
[01:27:55.771 --> 01:28:06.859]  The future is what I call stakeholder capitalism, which is combined with the social responsibility.
[01:28:07.459 --> 01:28:15.125]  Ah, and they define the social responsibility that you will eat the bugs, you will not have children, too many can have a baby.
[01:28:16.323 --> 01:28:21.849]  And Blackrock then says, we'll quote, control your behavior with the ESGs, with the social credit score.
[01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.371]  It's not coming.
[01:28:23.591 --> 01:28:24.172]  It's here.
[01:28:26.795 --> 01:28:28.597]  So it's really this simple.
[01:28:29.926 --> 01:28:54.300]   The Pentagon, the Rand Corporation, told Biden's controllers, if you give heavy cruise missiles and put troops publicly, because Western troops have been there before the war officially kicked off a year and a half ago, really kicked off nine years ago with the overthrow of the Ukrainian government by the CIA and the State Department, and they bragged about that on CNN everywhere, Fareed Zakaria, George Soros.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.101]  It's Joe Biden.
[01:28:56.261 --> 01:28:57.582]  They've all run their mouths about it.
[01:28:58.243 --> 01:28:59.244]  It's a client state.
[01:28:59.304 --> 01:29:00.144]  It's a proxy state.
[01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:01.485]  It's a money laundering state.
[01:29:02.066 --> 01:29:05.088]  Once they destroy it all, they'll then build it back up with a new Marshall Plan.
[01:29:05.108 --> 01:29:06.009]  Told you that was coming.
[01:29:06.329 --> 01:29:07.070]  Now that's been announced.
[01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:19.599]  But why then, if they said, can't send Abrams tanks, can't send F-16s, can't send heavy cruise missiles, long-range missiles, can't strike inside Russia, why is that now all happening?
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:21.341]  Because Russia's winning.
[01:29:23.407 --> 01:29:34.855]  I want to show you a graph here.
[01:29:35.196 --> 01:29:37.177]  This graph explains it all.
[01:29:38.158 --> 01:29:47.497]   You've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28
[01:29:47.497 --> 01:29:55.158]   countries all feeding into Ukraine to attack Russia.
[01:29:55.402 --> 01:30:01.006]  And so Russia's won the conflict so far, and it's crushed the proxy state.
[01:30:04.048 --> 01:30:12.914]  And so now the proxy state says, well, we said before in our mathematical political analyses that if we escalate, Russia will start using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
[01:30:13.214 --> 01:30:29.934]   That will soon lead into a larger theater war in the area, and then a full-blown nuclear exchange Between Russia and the West, that will make the planet with a foreseeable future uninhabitable and probably kill 90% of the world population, which actually gets the globalists where they want to go on their official numbers.
[01:30:31.295 --> 01:30:42.986]  So you had a lot of people that didn't want to die, and their grandkids to die, and their kids to die, in the Pentagon, in the CIA, in MI6, and all the think tanks saying, don't escalate past this point, it'll lead to war.
[01:30:43.246 --> 01:30:44.267]  And now they've said, you know what?
[01:30:44.787 --> 01:30:46.429]  We really don't care about that.
[01:30:47.964 --> 01:30:49.205]  Let's just go ahead and do it.
[01:30:50.146 --> 01:30:55.510]  And so that's the decision that has been made.
[01:30:57.252 --> 01:31:12.444]  So they can use the escalating Russia war in the next year, or a year out, 13 months from the election, as the political crisis to bring in the permanent control of the new currency system, like they did after World War II.
[01:31:13.641 --> 01:31:20.965]  Or they can do a cyber attack, claim the Russians did it, which they've been pre-programming and preparing the public for, claiming Russia works with Trump supporters, we're about to knock the power out, preposterous.
[01:31:21.405 --> 01:31:23.286]  That's all over the news, that's in FBI memos.
[01:31:24.167 --> 01:31:41.796]  They can release a new virus, they can do all three, they can do... They've got so many horrible scenarios that they've got warmed up and ready and are already pre-programming in the public's mind, so when they roll out the official story to blame who they want, the public subconsciously remembers it and accepts that because they've already been prepped for it.
[01:31:43.732 --> 01:32:05.727]  But regardless of the World War 3 scenario that we're already in but is accelerating towards nuclear war, you have the clear get Michelle Obama aka Big Mike ready, get Gavin Newsom ready, all the pressure on Biden to make him step down, everybody, all the Democrats telling him to step down, all over the news telling him to step down, Democrats resigning telling him to step down.
[01:32:07.219 --> 01:32:08.160]  He still doesn't do it.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.661]  Trump won't back down.
[01:32:09.961 --> 01:32:11.322]  He's 20 points ahead of Biden.
[01:32:12.102 --> 01:32:14.404]  60 points in the Republican field he gets.
[01:32:14.704 --> 01:32:16.105]  All the other candidates get about 40.
[01:32:18.067 --> 01:32:18.927]  They're on this course.
[01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:20.388]  They've decided to do this.
[01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:22.310]  So, how are they going to remove Trump?
[01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:28.134]  Well, these cases aren't going to get him in jail by the time he gets elected.
[01:32:29.354 --> 01:32:31.216]  He can pardon himself from federal, not local.
[01:32:32.917 --> 01:32:34.358]  But then he's going to go after these people.
[01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:34.918]  They know that.
[01:32:34.958 --> 01:32:35.479]  They've said that.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:37.200]  So what's left?
[01:32:39.802 --> 01:32:40.502]  Assassination.
[01:32:40.842 --> 01:32:44.605]  They may poison his food, you know, so he won't eat any of the food that's prepared around him.
[01:32:44.865 --> 01:32:52.809]  He'll send a random person, who doesn't even know where they're going, or who used someone to order on an app, 50 McDonald's meals.
[01:32:53.169 --> 01:33:00.453]  And then he'll walk up randomly and grab one, and I can confirm people that are very close, he does that because he believes he's been hit with stuff several times.
[01:33:02.454 --> 01:33:03.395]  And he's as tough as a bull.
[01:33:08.047 --> 01:33:13.091]  So, will they poison him and just say he had a heart attack?
[01:33:13.431 --> 01:33:14.532]  Will they blow his airplane up?
[01:33:15.493 --> 01:33:19.536]  They're going to remove Biden and Trump, if they get away with it, if they can.
[01:33:19.556 --> 01:33:21.798]  They're not all powerful, one way or another.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.341]  And they're getting more and more frantic.
[01:33:25.361 --> 01:33:26.522]  They're getting more and more desperate.
[01:33:26.542 --> 01:33:27.743]  They're getting more and more crazy.
[01:33:28.183 --> 01:33:34.088]  And they already have all these emergencies, anti-gun emergencies, environmental emergencies, and border emergencies they've created.
[01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:35.389]  They think you have no memory.
[01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:36.470]  So they say, come here.
[01:33:37.335 --> 01:33:44.780]  Get the clip ready of Hochul in New York, you know, two years ago saying, come here, come here, the border's open, come to New York, we want you.
[01:33:45.841 --> 01:33:50.964]  Now, no, no, no, don't come here, go to red states, we need you to vote Democrat there.
[01:33:55.467 --> 01:34:08.833]   So they break the border, they tell you to come here, the UN organizes it with the WEF, they set it up, they have lockdowns to make them come here, because they're starving to death, they get here, And they fully politically weaponized them, and then now they say, oh no!
[01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:14.597]  We don't want people here because it's causing such a landslide and a full political realignment.
[01:34:15.477 --> 01:34:17.118]  California, I told you this years ago.
[01:34:17.338 --> 01:34:18.519]  Now Trump says it, it's true.
[01:34:19.039 --> 01:34:19.659]  You see the numbers.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.801]  California, 65% Republican.
[01:34:22.861 --> 01:34:23.842]  New York, 65% Republican.
[01:34:23.882 --> 01:34:24.742]  Michigan, 65, 70% Republican.
[01:34:25.863 --> 01:34:26.123]  Wisconsin.
[01:34:25.962 --> 01:34:29.322]  Michigan 65, 70% Republican.
[01:34:29.322 --> 01:34:33.322]  Wisconsin.
[01:34:33.322 --> 01:34:35.962]  Minnesota.
[01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:39.362]   But Republicans learn that they're being cheated so they stop voting.
[01:34:39.512 --> 01:34:43.376]  Then they got dead people and folks out of state and illegals to vote.
[01:34:43.776 --> 01:34:48.201]  So they've got this pool because Republicans don't go out and vote because they know it's a scam.
[01:34:48.461 --> 01:34:57.951]  But if it's a giant landslide, they don't have enough dead people and enough people out of state who they've stolen their identity through the full Facebook scam with that database with the hundreds of millions they spent on it.
[01:34:59.329 --> 01:35:00.290]  They run out of bullets.
[01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:04.994]  That's why, oh look, Beto's winning in Texas until they run out and suddenly the Republicans win.
[01:35:05.694 --> 01:35:06.455]  Same thing in Florida.
[01:35:07.816 --> 01:35:23.109]  So they're deathly afraid because there's such a massive political realignment of Democrats leaving in droves where if the Democrats are going to lose in the real election by 60 points or 70 points, Trump's 20 points ahead of Biden.
[01:35:24.811 --> 01:35:25.892]  And that's in their skewed polls.
[01:35:29.005 --> 01:35:31.266]  So now Trump has a super majority.
[01:35:32.247 --> 01:35:34.168]  They can't beat that, and it's the same everywhere.
[01:35:34.568 --> 01:35:36.129]  And Republicans haven't figured that out yet.
[01:35:40.091 --> 01:35:41.833]  So Republicans all go out and vote.
[01:35:43.193 --> 01:35:43.954]  They'll have to do what they didn't.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:45.820]  Arizona, remember?
[01:35:46.181 --> 01:35:59.528]  Where all the key Republican precincts that vote like 80% Republican, they gave them ballots that were two inches too short, on record, and wouldn't feed, so they all malfunctioned and had to be sent to a central tabulation center.
[01:36:02.529 --> 01:36:08.753]  And then it gets lost in the wash that they found, well, those were actually Trump votes, Trump should win, the judges say, no, we don't care.
[01:36:10.649 --> 01:36:19.374]  Or in the case of Pennsylvania or Michigan, oh, you have UPS drivers and USPS drivers that go on record saying, I wonder what this was.
[01:36:19.394 --> 01:36:24.396]  And it was suspicious, all these boxes I opened and it was all votes for Biden.
[01:36:24.416 --> 01:36:32.621]  Because they had a deal with local Republicans that went along, we will get rid of you.
[01:36:32.881 --> 01:36:34.882]  It was all Biden and Senate races.
[01:36:36.141 --> 01:36:37.122]  That's what they decided to steal.
[01:36:37.562 --> 01:36:44.588]  So you open up, there's like 30 boxes or more, and you open them, it's all for Biden, and it's all for the Democrat senators.
[01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:50.232]  And you call the FBI and they come and threaten you.
[01:36:50.252 --> 01:36:50.933]  That's all come out.
[01:36:53.615 --> 01:36:59.019]  Then they read Haring and saying, oh, it's computer hacking, oh, it's an Italian satellite, oh, it's the Israelis.
[01:37:00.861 --> 01:37:02.442]  And it's all right there in front of you.
[01:37:04.889 --> 01:37:17.616]  But they still had to have all those ballots with somebody's name that died or moved out of state with a Facebook database, and then they fill them out at a warehouse out of state, and they ship it right in.
[01:37:19.397 --> 01:37:26.460]  And then it's broken up by the thousands of mules that go put 10, 20, 30, 40 ballots per post office box.
[01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:31.403]  Per post office, you know, blue drop-off mailbox.
[01:37:32.662 --> 01:37:33.343]  Mailer box.
[01:37:34.043 --> 01:37:34.864]  And that's how you do it.
[01:37:35.444 --> 01:37:40.528]  But you can only do that if Trump's only winning by five points, which he did.
[01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:42.590]  The numbers show it.
[01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:48.695]  But if Trump's winning by 10 or 15 or 20, they don't have a prayer in hell.
[01:37:49.744 --> 01:37:56.526]  And that's why they're hitting the panic button saying he's going to win, he's unstoppable, we don't know what to do, we've got to stop him.
[01:37:56.926 --> 01:38:02.588]  That's why they don't care how crazy they look or how corrupt they look because the whole thing is out of the open.
[01:38:02.608 --> 01:38:10.991]  We're going to go to break and come back with Professor Darren Beattie with huge Elon Musk news on a whole bunch of fronts.
[01:38:11.751 --> 01:38:16.853]  Same group that sued me when the kangaroo operation is suing Elon Musk.
[01:38:19.224 --> 01:38:21.045]  But let me talk about funding this operation.

[01:41:44.369 --> 01:41:50.128]   ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.

[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:37.721]  I've been shadowbanned.
[01:42:38.501 --> 01:42:39.821]  I've been called a liar.
[01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:44.002]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[01:42:44.662 --> 01:42:46.962]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[01:42:47.562 --> 01:42:50.123]  They've tried to destroy me, but I've survived.
[01:42:51.656 --> 01:42:53.738]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[01:42:55.259 --> 01:42:57.782]  The replatforming begins now!
[01:42:57.982 --> 01:43:13.976]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com All over the country, from the southern border to Illinois, politicians, Democrats are calling for the UN to occupy America.
[01:43:13.996 --> 01:43:16.699]  The UN's suing over our border policy, saying it's not open enough.
[01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:21.671]  Here's a Chicago County Commissioner calls for U.N.
[01:43:21.731 --> 01:43:22.572]  troops on the streets.
[01:43:24.773 --> 01:43:42.603]  Well, we're headed to the United Nations to meet with the Assistant Secretary General to talk about the violence in Chicago, the gun violence in particular, the bloodshed that's taking place in too many of our communities like Austin, West Garfield Park, North Mondale, places like that.
[01:43:43.243 --> 01:43:47.649]  Well, we've just seen horrific levels of shootings and that sort of thing.
[01:43:48.289 --> 01:44:00.364]  And so I'm hoping to appeal to the UN to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts.
[01:44:00.965 --> 01:44:05.509]  Because I think it's so critical for us to make sure that these neighborhoods are safe.
[01:44:06.089 --> 01:44:13.616]  Quite frankly, we fail the people of Chicago in many instances in these communities because we failed to protect them from the violence.
[01:44:14.196 --> 01:44:22.043]  I'll also say this, that there is a quiet genocide taking place in too many of our communities.
[01:44:22.063 --> 01:44:25.686]  80% of those who are being killed by gun violence are African American.
[01:44:26.266 --> 01:44:26.406]  Why now?
[01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:29.506]  and often killed at the hands of another African American.
[01:44:29.506 --> 01:44:32.525]  And so we must protect these population groups.
[01:44:32.525 --> 01:44:34.606]  And that's what the United Nations does.
[01:44:34.606 --> 01:44:36.526]  They're a peacekeeping force.
[01:44:36.526 --> 01:44:39.126]  They know all about keeping the peace.
[01:44:39.126 --> 01:44:42.046]  And so we're hopeful that they'll, they'll hear our appeal.
[01:44:42.046 --> 01:44:50.085]   Well, look, we, this meeting has been in place for at least a month now.
[01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:52.392]  We've worked on this a while.
[01:44:53.293 --> 01:45:03.240]  Quite frankly, we can't wait until, you know, the mayor comes up with another thousand police to try to make the streets safer.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:08.043]  Quite frankly, the people want to be safe right now in their homes and their neighborhoods.
[01:45:08.444 --> 01:45:09.845]  And we want to make sure that they're safe.
[01:45:10.265 --> 01:45:11.646]  And that's why we're doing it today.
[01:45:11.886 --> 01:45:12.807]  We can't afford to wait.
[01:45:13.658 --> 01:45:20.658]  What are some ways that they could solve this problem?
[01:45:20.658 --> 01:45:22.658]   Like physical ways that you think that the university could come in and help?
[01:45:22.658 --> 01:45:28.247]   Look, I think they've been able to help in places like Africa and abroad where they've sent troops in and sent
[01:45:28.247 --> 01:45:33.658]   forces in to help protect minority and vulnerable populations.
[01:45:33.558 --> 01:45:37.859]  And so, quite frankly, I think the same can be said here in Chicago.
[01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:46.482]  I know that there are those who will disagree and who will say that this is an admission that we can't protect the people in the city.
[01:45:46.522 --> 01:45:48.943]  But quite frankly, we haven't protected them.
[01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:56.830]  The UN, if you study it all over the world, runs giant mass murder operations.
[01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:57.651]  Look at Rwanda.
[01:45:57.731 --> 01:45:58.351]  Look at Burma.
[01:45:58.471 --> 01:46:01.272]  I mean, just look up UN Massacre Burma, UN Massacre Rwanda.
[01:46:01.492 --> 01:46:05.814]  They orchestrated the killing of over a million people to take their land, Christians, in Rwanda.
[01:46:05.854 --> 01:46:07.255]  The Clintons, of course, were part of that.
[01:46:08.155 --> 01:46:08.815]  Just unbelievable.
[01:46:09.195 --> 01:46:14.878]  Now, he was a gangster and the mob boss of Chicago Mayor Daley back in the 60s when they had the riots.
[01:46:15.778 --> 01:46:22.006]  And we're going to play a clip of what he said to do to looters and rioters, or mostly peaceful protesters.
[01:46:22.046 --> 01:46:35.038]   Remember, the Democrat can pull the fire alarm and won't get in trouble, says he thought it was a door handle, but people that walked him through the velvet ropes on January 6th, they're serving long prison sentences. So here
[01:46:35.038 --> 01:46:40.599]   is a clip of Mayor Daley from the Time Vault and then we'll go to break
[01:46:40.599 --> 01:46:45.939]   and go back to Professor Darren Beatty Who's got some major breaking Elon Musk intel that's huge.
[01:46:45.939 --> 01:46:49.337]   They got the system really really scared. We'll be right back.
[01:46:49.337 --> 01:46:58.599]   I said to him very emphatically and very definitely That an order be issued immediately under his signature
[01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:06.427]   To shoot to kill any arsonist or Anyone with a Molotov cocktail in their hand in Chicago to
[01:47:06.427 --> 01:47:12.229]   fire a building Because they're potential murderers and to issue a police
[01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:19.458]   order To shoot the main or cripple anyone looting any stores in
[01:47:19.458 --> 01:47:30.599]   our city [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:47:22.828 --> 01:47:36.545]   And above all, the crime of arson is to me the most hideous and worst crime of any and should be dealt with in this fashion.
[01:47:36.545 --> 01:47:42.545]   I was disappointed to know that every policeman out on the beat was supposed to use his own decision.
[01:47:42.545 --> 01:47:48.545]  And this decision evidently was his.
[01:47:48.545 --> 01:47:55.545]   In my opinion, he should have had instructions to shoot arsonists and to shoot looters.
[01:47:55.545 --> 01:48:02.545]   Well, he's a former speechwriter and policy advisor in the Trump administration.
[01:48:02.921 --> 01:48:04.421]  He's a professor of political science.
[01:48:04.721 --> 01:48:07.262]  Professor Darren Beatty joins us for the next 25 minutes.
[01:48:07.282 --> 01:48:10.802]  Then I'm going to get into all the rest of the news we haven't gotten to after he leaves us.
[01:48:11.242 --> 01:48:13.483]  We don't cover the most important news at the start of the show.
[01:48:13.903 --> 01:48:19.984]  Every hour is vital, but I would have covered this up front, but he can only come on now, so I wanted to get him on to talk about it.
[01:48:20.004 --> 01:48:21.464]  There's a lot of Elon Musk news.
[01:48:21.484 --> 01:48:23.285]  Now, Elon lives here in Austin.
[01:48:24.278 --> 01:48:25.100]  I know a lot of people know him.
[01:48:25.762 --> 01:48:26.905]  I don't say he's perfect.
[01:48:26.925 --> 01:48:30.734]  I don't like a lot of his past behavior, but he's definitely got the globalists after him now.
[01:48:30.794 --> 01:48:32.759]  He's definitely taken on the new world order empire.
[01:48:33.686 --> 01:48:35.886]  And so now NBC News, here's the headline.
[01:48:36.527 --> 01:48:38.067]  What was Elon Musk's strategy for Twitter?
[01:48:38.847 --> 01:48:41.988]  To take on, dismantle the globalist American empire.
[01:48:42.608 --> 01:48:57.531]  And then they noticed that what they read in a discovery, not knowing who the author was in Elon's text and emails, mirrored word for word what Professor Beatty was saying in the White House when he had also written and later at Revolver.News.
[01:48:58.051 --> 01:49:05.253]   So they're trying to find out if he's the one, like it's illegal or something, to oppose the globalist EmpireRevolver.news.
[01:49:05.673 --> 01:49:09.596]  So I want to talk about what's really going on in the attack on Musk, where this is all going.
[01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:12.157]  Big article on Infowars.com by Ben Warren.
[01:49:12.518 --> 01:49:16.960]  MSM fumes over Musk's handling of X. Blames former Trump White House speechwriter.
[01:49:17.441 --> 01:49:20.142]  Roadmap that declares war against globalist American empire.
[01:49:20.923 --> 01:49:21.703]  And it continues.
[01:49:21.743 --> 01:49:31.470]  He's now been sued by the same Democrat Party operatives that sued me in the show trials where the judge judges found me guilty.
[01:49:32.389 --> 01:49:38.617]  They've now sued him as well, but he's... If I'm a big elephant to eat...
[01:49:39.738 --> 01:49:43.360]  And they haven't been able to shut us down thanks to Lister's support and prayer and everything he's done.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:45.081]  I don't see how they're going to get Musk.
[01:49:45.141 --> 01:49:46.422]  I think they might assassinate him.
[01:49:47.063 --> 01:49:53.907]  And I'm going to get Darren Beattie's take on Carlson and Posobiec and myself thinking they don't plan to have Biden or Trump in the election.
[01:49:53.947 --> 01:49:57.509]  They're planning acceleration of war, assassinations of these guys.
[01:49:58.150 --> 01:50:00.151]  They're getting puppet candidates on both sides ready.
[01:50:00.451 --> 01:50:04.053]  We'll get his take on that in the next 20-something minutes we have left.
[01:50:04.433 --> 01:50:05.214]  We're going to move through it.
[01:50:05.274 --> 01:50:07.555]  But Sandy Hook, lawyers, sues.
[01:50:08.556 --> 01:50:09.837]  Plus for $45 million.
[01:50:11.379 --> 01:50:14.442]  Here's a little inside baseball, and I'm going to move on from that and get his take on it.
[01:50:15.423 --> 01:50:17.164]  I have the inside on this, okay?
[01:50:18.065 --> 01:50:21.849]  And I don't want to toot my horn or anything, but they violated state law with their rulings.
[01:50:21.909 --> 01:50:27.494]  The judge, what they did, it's been signaled by the bankruptcy court that it's going to be thrown out.
[01:50:27.935 --> 01:50:29.416]  Okay?
[01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:31.138]  Just the damages.
[01:50:31.963 --> 01:50:35.446]  They're not going to even revisit the so-called show trial where I was already found guilty.
[01:50:35.906 --> 01:50:36.506]  That's the word.
[01:50:36.586 --> 01:50:37.187]  Knock on wood.
[01:50:38.668 --> 01:50:40.469]  That's why they're in full panic mode moving on.
[01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:42.271]  How do you kill one story with another story?
[01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:45.733]  Musk said, looks to me like somebody's a Fed.
[01:50:46.134 --> 01:50:47.415]  I'm not saying the person's a Fed.
[01:50:47.775 --> 01:50:55.320]  It looks like it was a case of mistaken identity in one of these Antifa slash Proud Boys slash National Front fights.
[01:50:56.201 --> 01:51:05.845]  But regardless, ladies and gentlemen, this is all part of the targeting of Musk and the media piling on whenever these law firms take action against people.
[01:51:06.325 --> 01:51:12.028]  In their own words, this lawyer said to silence me and quote, never let me have a platform again.
[01:51:12.488 --> 01:51:14.169]  So that's what all this lawfare is about.
[01:51:14.569 --> 01:51:17.030]  It's backfired in the case of Trump spectacularly.
[01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:19.571]  We're still here because of your support.
[01:51:21.051 --> 01:51:23.833]  So, I appreciate everybody going to Infowars.com and getting great products.
[01:51:23.873 --> 01:51:29.956]  Our new book's now available, signed and unsigned, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Second Great Renaissance.
[01:51:30.236 --> 01:51:37.560]  But now, without further ado, Revolver.news, Professor Darren Beattie, thanks for coming on on short notice.
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:44.083]  I'm going to kind of just try to give you the floor here on what you really think of Musk, what's happening here, where you think this is going.
[01:51:45.936 --> 01:51:46.576]  Absolutely.
[01:51:47.317 --> 01:51:58.303]  First, I'd like to say it was very refreshing to hear the remarks from, I guess that was Mayor Daley, his position on looters and such.
[01:51:58.343 --> 01:52:02.565]  It serves as a reminder that we were once actually a real country.
[01:52:03.105 --> 01:52:23.204]   And it's hard to imagine any elected official having the iron and courage to say anything remotely close to Mayor Daley's eminently sensible remarks, so it was just a little bit... I wasn't alive back then, but it was nostalgic for a time.
[01:52:23.224 --> 01:52:27.629]  That was back when Chicago was a great, wonderful city, and now it is a failed city.
[01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:29.390]  Absolutely.
[01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:30.371]  And you know, you're right.
[01:52:30.491 --> 01:52:37.578]  This was the time of the mob in Chicago, but it was, you know, ironically, a lot better structured back then.
[01:52:38.454 --> 01:52:41.236]  Um, you know, the mob wasn't going around and looting.
[01:52:41.456 --> 01:52:46.618]  And if anything, they would have, you know, played a role in cleaning up the trash that was looting.
[01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:49.560]  So again, it's, it's really remarkable.
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:53.162]  And I think it's important to play these clips because.
[01:52:54.093 --> 01:53:01.397]  We're on the verge of a sort of amnesia where we forget, you know, that that sort of thing is impossible.
[01:53:01.577 --> 01:53:03.738]  Like, it's so inconceivable.
[01:53:03.798 --> 01:53:19.066]   When you see that, it's hard to believe that at any time in our country, an elected official, of course, you know, Daley was a Democrat, he was corrupt and all this, but It's just hard to believe that any elected official could talk like this, but this isn't hundreds of years ago.
[01:53:19.086 --> 01:53:21.908]  This is, this is, you know, less than a century ago.
[01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:27.831]  This is 60-something years ago, and since you brought it up, some stations don't carry that last segment.
[01:53:27.871 --> 01:53:28.932]  It's only a minute clip.
[01:53:28.952 --> 01:53:29.953]  Let's play it for context.
[01:53:29.973 --> 01:53:30.353]  Here it is.
[01:53:32.914 --> 01:53:40.159]  I said to him very emphatically and very definitely that an order be issued immediately under his signature.
[01:53:42.156 --> 01:54:02.243]  To shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a Molotov cocktail in their hand in Chicago, to fire a building because they're potential murderers, and to issue a police order to shoot to maim or cripple anyone looting any stores in our city.
[01:54:04.364 --> 01:54:17.862]   And above all, the crime of arson is to me the most hideous and Worst crime of any and should be dealt with in this fashion.
[01:54:18.762 --> 01:54:23.985]  I was disappointed to know that every policeman out on the beat was supposed to use his own decision.
[01:54:26.506 --> 01:54:30.208]  And this decision evidently was his.
[01:54:31.229 --> 01:54:37.132]  In my opinion, he should have had instructions to shoot arsonists and to shoot looters.
[01:54:40.005 --> 01:54:42.965]  All right, we've only got like 16 minutes left with you.
[01:54:42.965 --> 01:54:44.844]   I don't want to get into Musk and all these big developments,
[01:54:44.844 --> 01:54:52.604]   but that is central to show the Soros rule over our DAs and how it's created this literal road warrior scenario.
[01:54:52.604 --> 01:54:54.204]  I mean, things are dangerous.
[01:54:54.204 --> 01:55:00.765]   No, I know we're getting low on time, but it's just, you know, I'm sure you're aware of that
[01:55:00.765 --> 01:55:07.244]   incident where there were two, I think one was underage, one was 18, just doing a joy ride.
[01:55:07.221 --> 01:55:11.641]  And just for the fun of it, they ran over some guy on a bike and killed him.
[01:55:12.122 --> 01:55:13.042]  Just for the fun of it.
[01:55:13.122 --> 01:55:14.062]  Because he was white.
[01:55:14.922 --> 01:55:15.102]  Yeah.
[01:55:15.542 --> 01:55:16.703]  And because he was white.
[01:55:16.823 --> 01:55:24.024]  And then, you know, apparently when they were arrested, one of the, one of the offenders said, Oh, you know, they won't do anything.
[01:55:24.064 --> 01:55:25.825]  They'll just give me a slap on the wrist.
[01:55:25.925 --> 01:55:27.545]  It's this general sense of.
[01:55:28.459 --> 01:55:46.452]  Zero accountability that manifests itself not only in the looting that we're seeing at every major city, making us a laughingstock, and really, frankly, how can we criticize China when, you know, for all of its faults, China would not put up with this kind of filth, looting their cities for one second.
[01:55:46.512 --> 01:55:48.794]  They'd have them strung up on their meat market.
[01:55:49.074 --> 01:55:51.896]  They'd be selling them for breakfast at the Wuhan market.
[01:55:52.436 --> 01:56:06.846]  So, this is making our country a laughing stock, and it's the attitude, the same attitude that you see with the people looting, is the attitude from these juveniles who just ran over a guy and killed him for fun.
[01:56:07.287 --> 01:56:10.329]  You don't have any accountability, you're gonna have more of this AI.
[01:56:10.409 --> 01:56:15.453]  And again, they're on video saying, let's kill him, it's fun, and hey, we're brown, so we're allowed to do it.
[01:56:17.194 --> 01:56:17.354]  Yeah.
[01:56:18.021 --> 01:56:19.622]  No, I mean, be it more of the same.
[01:56:19.682 --> 01:56:22.485]  If there's no accountability, of course they're going to act like that.
[01:56:22.625 --> 01:56:39.880]  So, you know, I guess the United States would rather debase itself, declown itself, rather plunge itself in a state of total third world destitution rather than do anything that would cause anyone to be accused of racism.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:48.920]   We'd literally rather destroy our country and our heritage and our entire civilization Then, oh, God forbid, be accused of racism.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:51.662]  That's how powerful that word is, which is really amazing.
[01:56:51.702 --> 01:56:56.425]  There's some kind of black magic going on to that to that word.
[01:56:56.545 --> 01:56:59.047]  But I understand that's not what you had me on for.
[01:56:59.087 --> 01:57:03.330]  I just had to react to the very interesting segment that you had.
[01:57:04.698 --> 01:57:11.482]  As for the Elon issue, this is actually pretty remarkable because, to me, this is not really a new story.
[01:57:11.502 --> 01:57:25.911]  You know, the mainstream media, and in particular some disinformation hack reporter, Ben Collins, who is of course androgynous, as they all are, but I had no idea how much so until I actually saw a video of him.
[01:57:26.311 --> 01:57:31.554]  I heard him on the phone, I was already suspect, but you see a video of him and, you know, all bets are off.
[01:57:32.054 --> 01:57:50.445]  But this guy who made a living as a disinformation hack researcher, apparently he's been on this, you know, white whale obsessive quest to find out who texted Elon Musk the article that we published at Revolver.
[01:57:51.417 --> 01:57:52.838]  And he's been looking for it.
[01:57:52.858 --> 01:57:55.318]  He's been doing all the kinds of requests.
[01:57:55.378 --> 01:57:58.600]  He and his colleague have apparently been working on it for seven months.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.341]  And they act like it's not a published viral article.
[01:58:01.361 --> 01:58:03.521]  They act like it's some dirty thing they're exposing.
[01:58:04.482 --> 01:58:06.142]  No, this article was everywhere.
[01:58:06.222 --> 01:58:08.963]  I went on Tucker Carlson to talk about the article.
[01:58:09.003 --> 01:58:16.006]  Of course, somebody texted it to Elon Musk, and there's a very good chance that he took some of that advice into account.
[01:58:16.907 --> 01:58:30.857]  That's already known, so I think they're just getting really worried because, notwithstanding some legitimate criticisms that remain of how Twitter functions, Elon Musk is getting braver and braver.
[01:58:30.877 --> 01:58:35.220]  He's taken 90% of the controls off and they're crapping bricks.
[01:58:35.922 --> 01:58:39.303]  Yeah, they're panicking and they're looking for somebody to blame.
[01:58:39.363 --> 01:58:46.726]  So they said, oh, look, this guy Darren Beatty is, you know, the architect and blah, blah, blah, trying to smear what Elon Musk is doing.
[01:58:47.666 --> 01:58:50.507]  But it just makes them look really ridiculous.
[01:58:50.568 --> 01:59:01.692]  And it's actually kind of, it's a reminder of just how pathetic their jobs are, because this guy's been digging for seven months to try to find out who texted Elon the article.
[01:59:01.712 --> 01:59:04.133]  I mean, I'm sure several people texted it to him.
[01:59:05.922 --> 01:59:06.822]  And he can't do it.
[01:59:06.942 --> 01:59:27.928]  So it's just kind of hilarious and frankly bizarre, especially because they're characterizing it simply as a blueprint, when a more accurate description of the article is a very prescient prediction of how the system would come after him should he decide to acquire Twitter and implement free speech.
[01:59:28.028 --> 01:59:28.489]  Absolutely.
[01:59:28.529 --> 01:59:29.649]  So get the headline out.
[01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:31.409]  We'll pull it up from Revolver.News right now.
[01:59:31.469 --> 01:59:33.190]  What's the original evil headline?
[01:59:35.328 --> 01:59:38.991]  Um, off the top of my head, I might not have it exactly.
[01:59:39.011 --> 01:59:42.794]  It's something like, um, Battle of the Century.
[01:59:43.555 --> 01:59:45.716]  Uh, that's the, the first part of it.
[01:59:45.796 --> 01:59:47.278]  And it's, you know, here's what happens.
[01:59:47.298 --> 01:59:48.559]  Battleofthecenturyrevolver.news.
[01:59:48.579 --> 01:59:49.059]  We'll pull it up.
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:50.100]  Yep.
[01:59:51.201 --> 01:59:51.321]  Um.
[01:59:52.105 --> 01:59:53.948]  Yeah, so it's Battle of the Century.
[01:59:53.988 --> 02:00:00.678]  It goes into several, you know, pretty prescient, but not, you know, entirely far-fetched.
[02:00:01.199 --> 02:00:03.262]  And by the way, I mean, I read the article back when it came out.
[02:00:03.342 --> 02:00:04.924]  It predicted everything, so great job.
[02:00:05.165 --> 02:00:06.327]  This is the Battle of the Century.
[02:00:07.591 --> 02:00:08.252]  Yes, it is.
[02:00:08.352 --> 02:00:19.040]  And, you know, I pointed out, you know, we published a number of, I think, really kind of analytically critical pieces on Elon Musk and the acquisition.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:25.465]  Actually, we published one of the pieces before we even acquired Twitter, so a lot of people were, you know, asking questions about that.
[02:00:25.545 --> 02:00:40.905]   But really, the exercise of understanding what Twitter actually was and how the price, whether it was $40 billion or $20 billion or whatever, Completely belied the actual value of Twitter.
[02:00:41.005 --> 02:00:44.788]  Yeah, they're pissed because you probably sold him on this political move.
[02:00:45.389 --> 02:00:48.371]  And they're just mad about it.
[02:00:48.631 --> 02:00:49.472]  They're furious.
[02:00:49.532 --> 02:00:55.096]  And again, they're looking for a way, you know, they're looking for somebody to blame.
[02:00:55.156 --> 02:00:59.399]  But whether I'm to blame or not, you know, Elon is obviously his own man.
[02:00:59.459 --> 02:01:00.980]  He makes his own decisions.
[02:01:01.561 --> 02:01:16.396]   And look, I mean, I find it ironic because actually, I'm more shadowbanned on Twitter now than I was before Elon took it over, but I'm still, you know, objectively comfortable saying that on the whole, Twitter is much better under Elon.
[02:01:16.496 --> 02:01:19.880]  I just happen to be more shadowbanned for whatever reason.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:26.585]  You actually work in the real world, so you know that any big organization... This is a small organization, but I don't know what's going on three rooms over.
[02:01:26.986 --> 02:01:29.628]  If people want to follow my vision, they'll do it.
[02:01:29.648 --> 02:01:30.689]  If they don't, we're screwed.
[02:01:31.089 --> 02:01:32.230]  So the idea... He said that.
[02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:34.212]  He said, I'm still trying to get rid of all the moles.
[02:01:34.632 --> 02:01:36.534]  He's already fired thousands of these censors.
[02:01:37.492 --> 02:01:38.272]  Right, right.
[02:01:38.372 --> 02:01:51.398]  I mean, there's still a lot of work to be done, and it's hard when you take over an organization like this, and there's still, you know, saboteurs, and there's still probably, you know, bugs embedded in the code, you know, censorship bugs embedded in the code.
[02:01:51.418 --> 02:01:52.098]  Backdoors!
[02:01:52.899 --> 02:01:53.119]  You know.
[02:01:53.757 --> 02:02:01.703]  All kinds of tweaks on the algorithms that need to be made and, you know, there are some hires that are questionable, you know, which still there are some questions.
[02:02:01.723 --> 02:02:03.885]  Yeah, the new lady, but he's trying to get the money back.
[02:02:03.945 --> 02:02:10.590]  But the point is the deep state's waging war on him, whether he's some outside globalist that wants control or whether he's real.
[02:02:10.930 --> 02:02:12.872]  Either way, he's disruptive to the new world order.
[02:02:14.199 --> 02:02:14.800]  Absolutely.
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:23.353]  And I think that's something we need to keep in context, even as we, you know, can have legitimate criticisms of what he's doing.
[02:02:23.453 --> 02:02:51.555]   There's, you know, very few examples other than Donald Trump, maybe no example of someone at his level With his money, with his stature and influence, taking a major risk, a major step that he's done to enhance the liberty of Americans, and in so doing, put himself in the direct crosshairs of a very evil, very ruthless, and very desperate regime.
[02:02:52.859 --> 02:02:53.439]  I agree with that.
[02:02:53.519 --> 02:03:03.065]  Tucker is making the point, that was my next question, that he thinks they may try to cancel the election or remove both Trump and Biden one way or another, including assassination, as he said to Trump face to face.
[02:03:04.206 --> 02:03:06.587]  And you follow the continuum of the escalation.
[02:03:06.627 --> 02:03:07.528]  That's where it goes next.
[02:03:07.548 --> 02:03:09.389]  I don't think you can really argue with that.
[02:03:09.409 --> 02:03:09.889]  What do you think?
[02:03:12.031 --> 02:03:14.132]  Well, of course, anything's possible.
[02:03:15.273 --> 02:03:18.194]  Assassination would not be something I'd predict.
[02:03:18.274 --> 02:03:26.759]   I think there You know, despite what it seems, very reluctant to take that ultimate step, and they probably won't need to.
[02:03:26.919 --> 02:03:36.085]  And also by doing so, they're sort of would be solidifying Trump's status as this martyr-like figure, which they probably don't want to do.
[02:03:36.105 --> 02:03:49.353]  I think they're really leaning into the lawfare angle and counting on that along with other, you know, tried and true mechanisms of, you know, voter suppression, censorship.
[02:03:49.953 --> 02:03:53.314]  Broad and so forth and maybe some additional tricks up their sleeve.
[02:03:53.815 --> 02:03:57.976]  So I think we haven't seen You know the ace yet.
[02:03:58.056 --> 02:04:04.259]  They still have the ace up their sleeve, but they're really gonna lean on all of these No, I agree, but they've got the ace of spades.
[02:04:04.299 --> 02:04:05.919]  That's the death card in their pocket.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.520]  What do they do about Biden?
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.521]  It's clear the state the deep state's turn against him.
[02:04:09.541 --> 02:04:10.321]  They want him gone.
[02:04:10.681 --> 02:04:11.822]  He's recalcitrant.
[02:04:11.842 --> 02:04:12.302]  What happens?
[02:04:13.598 --> 02:04:14.718]  No, that's a great question.
[02:04:14.778 --> 02:04:20.640]  They're in a strategic dilemma here because on the one hand, they want Biden to get the hell out.
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:42.897]   On the other hand, the more that they sort of implicitly or even more directly threaten Biden with the prospect of criminal charges against him or his family members, the more he will be incentivized to cling on to the presidency in order to retain the pardon power for his Family members.
[02:04:43.117 --> 02:04:45.959]  And so there's an odd sort of tension there.
[02:04:46.019 --> 02:04:54.486]  Of course, there's an additional difficulty that his VP is now Kamala Harris, who is even less popular than he is.
[02:04:54.806 --> 02:04:59.974]   And the establishment understands that and that she won't be president.
[02:04:59.974 --> 02:05:05.573]   And so they need to find a way to gracefully not only remove Biden, but
[02:05:05.573 --> 02:05:10.353]  also to remove Kamala Harris and replace her with somebody.
[02:05:10.353 --> 02:05:14.512]   It's very difficult to see how they would replace her with a white
[02:05:14.512 --> 02:05:18.913]   person because of that, you know, that's the cardinal sin, according
[02:05:18.913 --> 02:05:20.653]  to the Democrats and their base.
[02:05:21.025 --> 02:05:24.908]  So they would probably need to replace her with someone who isn't white.
[02:05:24.948 --> 02:05:30.292]  And I think that's fueled a lot of the speculation that maybe Michelle Obama is waiting in the wings.
[02:05:30.653 --> 02:05:36.998]  I'm not terribly convinced of that, but the logic behind it makes some sense, at least from that perspective.
[02:05:37.278 --> 02:05:41.603]   But they have a very Intricate strategic problem to solve.
[02:05:42.044 --> 02:05:50.949]  I think they'll have to make some kind of reliable deal with Biden and say, OK, if you step down, you know, rest assured you won't be prosecuted.
[02:05:51.009 --> 02:05:52.689]  Your family won't be prosecuted.
[02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:56.532]  And then find some way to deal with the Kamala situation.
[02:05:56.892 --> 02:06:00.654]  Sure, because his cognitive decline is accelerating.
[02:06:01.074 --> 02:06:02.655]  I don't think he can make it to the election.
[02:06:04.122 --> 02:06:05.203]  It's dubious.
[02:06:05.343 --> 02:06:05.904]  It really is.
[02:06:05.964 --> 02:06:10.067]  I mean, the cognitive decline itself doesn't really bother them.
[02:06:10.107 --> 02:06:10.687]  That's clear.
[02:06:10.748 --> 02:06:13.550]  Otherwise, you know, he wouldn't be there right now.
[02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:23.278]  But the question of whether he can actually last through the election is a very pregnant one, shall we say.
[02:06:23.378 --> 02:06:27.021]  So they at the very least need a viable plan B.
[02:06:28.795 --> 02:06:41.031]  I think if it were possible for them, Newsom could actually be a formidable force, but again, it's difficult to simply install him for the Kamala reason, among others.
[02:06:41.311 --> 02:06:44.675]  You can also see the speed issue.
[02:06:45.401 --> 02:06:47.423]  That's why he's off like 44% of the time.
[02:06:47.904 --> 02:06:49.866]  He's obviously on speed, blood transfusions.
[02:06:49.906 --> 02:06:50.767]  They crank him up.
[02:06:51.047 --> 02:06:52.389]  He's able to halfway operate.
[02:06:52.689 --> 02:06:57.514]  Then he goes and collapses for a week at his, you know, home on the East Coast.
[02:06:57.534 --> 02:06:58.856]  Then he comes back again.
[02:06:59.176 --> 02:07:00.278]  It's very clear what's happening.
[02:07:01.859 --> 02:07:02.460]  Yes, it is.
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:07.894]   And, you know, the Democrat machine is still Fairly functional.
[02:07:08.254 --> 02:07:15.044]  We saw the workings of the Democrat machine in propelling Biden to the nomination in the first place.
[02:07:15.064 --> 02:07:21.054]   You know, people forget how Just how quick and kind of arresting it was.
[02:07:21.094 --> 02:07:24.618]  There were a bunch of, you know, seemingly viable players.
[02:07:24.719 --> 02:07:26.481]  Everyone had their moment in the sun.
[02:07:26.521 --> 02:07:28.883]  You know, there was Buttigieg and all these others.
[02:07:28.964 --> 02:07:33.849]  And all of a sudden in lockstep, it was Biden was the guy and everyone fell in line.
[02:07:33.869 --> 02:07:42.072]   You know, that was an impressive display of of discipline from the well-oiled Democrat machine that the
[02:07:42.072 --> 02:07:47.132]   counterparts in the Republican machine simply couldn't pull off. So the question is, does that
[02:07:47.132 --> 02:07:54.523]   machine still have that level of juice to figure out the strategic dilemma right now with Biden
[02:07:54.523 --> 02:07:55.912]  and Kamala?
[02:07:55.912 --> 02:08:00.472]   Revolver.News. We should talk privately soon because I don't want to give names out,
[02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:03.113]   but I can, you're a journalist, I can give them to you off record, I trust you.
[02:08:03.321 --> 02:08:07.623]  I've talked to people very close to Musk, and they say he's fully awake and pissed now.
[02:08:08.443 --> 02:08:17.086]  And so, it looks to me like he's really coming over to our side, so we should put maybe a bigger article out giving him advice or ideas, because it does seem that he is receptive to that.
[02:08:17.106 --> 02:08:21.287]  With two and a half minutes left, what else is on your focal point?
[02:08:21.327 --> 02:08:23.508]  What else is front and center for you?
[02:08:25.643 --> 02:08:43.680]  Well, we've got a major piece coming out probably tonight, maybe tomorrow morning, and that piece will, in great detail, address the question of what the hell are we going to do in response to the weaponization of the Justice Department and really just the rule of law by the Democrats?
[02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:54.987]   How do we respond to a situation which The Democrats are simply charging and arresting people on our side for political reasons.
[02:08:55.047 --> 02:08:56.788]  That's the issue right now.
[02:08:56.848 --> 02:08:57.448]  It's interesting.
[02:08:57.468 --> 02:08:59.969]  We're talking about Musk and the big tech censorship.
[02:09:00.449 --> 02:09:04.271]  Big tech censorship used to be the number one impediment for us.
[02:09:04.792 --> 02:09:07.673]  Now it's even deeper and more existential.
[02:09:07.713 --> 02:09:14.918]   The number one impediment is the weaponization of The Justice Department by the Democrats.
[02:09:14.978 --> 02:09:20.082]  If we don't correct that issue, nothing else is going to work and nothing else matters.
[02:09:20.142 --> 02:09:28.188]  So this is going to be the classic, the definitive piece that addresses what's going on and what we can do about it.
[02:09:28.308 --> 02:09:29.950]  So I hope everyone tunes in.
[02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:31.831]  ChecksRevolver.News for that.
[02:09:32.271 --> 02:09:32.812]  Well, that's right.
[02:09:32.852 --> 02:09:37.776]  That's why Venezuela can't ever get a dictatorship, because they have a Justice Department there that's just like ours.
[02:09:38.236 --> 02:09:40.338]  That's really the Praetorian Guard.
[02:09:41.926 --> 02:09:43.227]  Yes, it is.
[02:09:43.667 --> 02:09:44.588]  And that's everything.
[02:09:45.028 --> 02:09:49.912]  If you have a corrupted Justice Department, elections don't matter, nothing else matters.
[02:09:50.132 --> 02:09:51.894]  Speech, free speech doesn't even matter.
[02:09:52.294 --> 02:09:54.676]  If you get too out of line, you'll just get arrested.
[02:09:55.116 --> 02:10:02.962]  As we've talked about, there was a guy who got arrested and actually charged and convicted for mocking Hillary Clinton on Twitter.
[02:10:03.603 --> 02:10:08.306]  Owen Schroyer, our own reporter, reports to federal prison on the 24th of this month.
[02:10:10.455 --> 02:10:10.975]  Shameful.
[02:10:11.196 --> 02:10:14.518]  No, it's really, it's beyond disgraceful.
[02:10:14.679 --> 02:10:19.863]  So, I'll take the America of Mayor Daley any day over what we have now.
[02:10:20.063 --> 02:10:21.424]  Well, I know you're a busy man, but...
[02:10:22.833 --> 02:10:30.156]  If you can come on tomorrow or the next day about this big Justice Department piece, I admire your mind and you've been on the cutting edge of fighting, Professor.
[02:10:30.216 --> 02:10:40.820]  So tell the crew right now, now you gotta go, if you can come on tomorrow or on Thursday or Friday to talk about how we dislodge this Justice Department coup.
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:41.560]  Thank you so much.
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.000]  Thank you.
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:43.721]  Will do, Alex.
[02:10:44.761 --> 02:10:49.743]  All right, I mentioned this several times the last few hours, but I like to actually play things that I talk about.
[02:10:51.258 --> 02:10:53.379]  And I know how these lawyers and these judges work.
[02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.481]  And Trump's very smart, but he has blind spots.
[02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:56.962]  He has blind spots I don't have.
[02:10:57.082 --> 02:10:58.342]  I have blind spots he doesn't have.
[02:10:58.883 --> 02:10:59.723]  But I've been through this.
[02:10:59.763 --> 02:11:00.944]  Nothing like he has, but I've learned.
[02:11:00.964 --> 02:11:12.891]  And when these judges do outrageous, insanely criminal things like find you guilty, and then have a trial telling a jury you're guilty, that's 80% of the case in their own words.
[02:11:13.271 --> 02:11:13.852]  That's illegal.
[02:11:15.595 --> 02:11:19.358]  And so Trump should already be appealing this, and there's mechanisms.
[02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:28.524]  But Trump says, well, I was going to attack the judge, we'll play the clip, but he admits that almost all of this is behind a statute of limitations, and so why are we even having this?
[02:11:29.165 --> 02:11:34.889]  Because he's going to skip those, and I've talked to lawyers involved, I've talked to people advising Trump.
[02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:42.575]  Once they get a trial going, they can ignore statute of limitations, if it's not objected to properly.
[02:11:43.615 --> 02:11:49.017]  So the judge is like, oh don't worry Trump, I found you guilty, but the statute of limitations is going to protect you.
[02:11:51.178 --> 02:11:53.539]  This is complete screwball world, okay?
[02:11:55.019 --> 02:11:55.919]  Absolutely nuts.
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:12:06.923]  Did you ever, until my case, cases, hear that a judge finds you guilty?
[02:12:08.264 --> 02:12:18.264]   Now in a criminal trial you can decide you want a judge instead of a jury.
[02:12:18.264 --> 02:12:22.023]  But you can't have a judge say you're guilty.
[02:12:22.176 --> 02:12:27.780]  Now they have this death penalty sanction, they call it, in Texas and in some other states, but it's really never used.
[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:51.916]   That again, if you're civilly sued, let's say for fraud, and you run away to wherever you go to, you run away to some third party country that doesn't have extradition, And then the judge can say, okay, I default you because you ran and you didn't respond to discovery.
[02:12:51.936 --> 02:12:53.817]  Now we're going to have a trial on the damages.
[02:12:53.857 --> 02:12:55.638]  You've still got to show the damages.
[02:12:56.098 --> 02:12:59.780]  So they found me in default, even though I was here, gave them all the discovery, proved I was innocent.
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:09.565]  When they didn't have a case, both in Connecticut and Texas, they found me, the judge found me guilty, then used all the twisted evidence against me and didn't allow me a defense.
[02:13:09.605 --> 02:13:14.188]  People watched Texas and Connecticut and said, Jones has got the worst lawyers the planet's ever seen.
[02:13:15.967 --> 02:13:16.887]  And that's not the case.
[02:13:19.888 --> 02:13:22.269]  I mean, you notice they're like, oh, we got Jones's phone.
[02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:24.830]  It was like their Zinger moment.
[02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:25.810]  Oh, we, you know, we got your phone.
[02:13:25.850 --> 02:13:30.772]  I'm like, yeah, I gave all my phones to them and they searched them and gave me what was in them.
[02:13:30.832 --> 02:13:37.074]  And then they made a mistake on like going back 10 years where they gave you like nine months of a phone.
[02:13:37.214 --> 02:13:46.094]   But I gave my lawyers the phones and They sent you all this data, so they had that and acted like, oh, we, we, we, and of course there was nothing there.
[02:13:46.114 --> 02:13:53.780]  And you saw the headlines, oh, there's gay stuff on Alex Jones' phone.
[02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:56.602]  Notice you never saw that, because I never reviewed it.
[02:13:56.742 --> 02:13:58.804]  I got the file, I looked at it, there was nothing gay on there.
[02:14:00.946 --> 02:14:03.348]  I've never sent a dick pic to anybody in my life.
[02:14:03.868 --> 02:14:05.610]  I've never taken a picture of my penis.
[02:14:07.451 --> 02:14:12.635]   But one time, And they're threatening now, the word is I've had a news call and they're going to publish it.
[02:14:12.655 --> 02:14:12.976]  Fine.
[02:14:13.296 --> 02:14:13.776]  Put it out there.
[02:14:14.276 --> 02:14:14.896]  I didn't do that.
[02:14:15.236 --> 02:14:15.637]  That's you.
[02:14:16.757 --> 02:14:24.300]  One time after sex with my wife, I pass out like men do, and she took a picture.
[02:14:25.441 --> 02:14:26.501]  And then she sent it to me.
[02:14:27.602 --> 02:14:28.482]  And I didn't erase it.
[02:14:29.443 --> 02:14:30.223]  I didn't remember it.
[02:14:32.124 --> 02:14:36.986]  Because quite frankly, looking at a picture of her own weenie, it's not like something you really care about or remember.
[02:14:37.619 --> 02:14:47.028]  But they got that, and that little nine-month snapshot of a piece of a phone they sent them, and it turns into, there's gay stuff, yeah, a picture of my penis.
[02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:49.370]  And word is they're gonna publish it next week.
[02:14:49.971 --> 02:14:50.271]  Great!
[02:14:55.156 --> 02:14:56.737]  I mean, it ain't huge, but it ain't small.
[02:14:56.998 --> 02:14:58.339]  I'm proud of my little Darth Vader.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:05.388]   But the point is, is that That's how they harass you.
[02:15:06.129 --> 02:15:11.513]  Newspapers, what do you say there's homoerotic pictures of genitals on your phone?
[02:15:11.874 --> 02:15:12.514]  I'm like, what?
[02:15:12.674 --> 02:15:13.815]  I go, let me see that file.
[02:15:14.176 --> 02:15:14.976]  They go, this is it.
[02:15:15.097 --> 02:15:19.961]  I'm like... And my wife's saying, you're so hot.
[02:15:22.823 --> 02:15:24.004]  And look, this is a family show.
[02:15:24.044 --> 02:15:26.907]  I'm just being honest with you because this is what they're going to put out.
[02:15:28.769 --> 02:15:39.279]  So I'm gay because my wife, I've had a child with, took a picture of my limp Johnson.
[02:15:44.043 --> 02:15:45.264]  And the women are getting excited.
[02:15:45.304 --> 02:15:53.312]  The women tell me it's very pretty, but the point is, is that this is the type of crap that goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:54.266 --> 02:15:55.167]  And this is harassment.
[02:15:55.207 --> 02:15:57.048]  You think I'm ashamed of that?
[02:15:57.788 --> 02:16:03.152]  I mean, I wouldn't put a picture of my weenie out, but the point is, that's what they do to harass people, folks.
[02:16:03.592 --> 02:16:06.033]  That's the level of the crap.
[02:16:08.715 --> 02:16:15.539]  And the way they spin it like ferrets on a wheel they're running on, how they take everything and turn it.
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:17.261]  Imagine, they get nine months to my phone.
[02:16:17.461 --> 02:16:18.942]  They think they've got the holy grail.
[02:16:20.763 --> 02:16:29.390]   And the best thing they've got Is my wife sending me a picture of my genitalia.
[02:16:30.170 --> 02:16:31.291]  And I'm sorry, Democrats.
[02:16:31.651 --> 02:16:34.393]  You didn't have your transgenderism going, then you didn't get to cut it off.
[02:16:35.193 --> 02:16:36.214]  No, that makes you mad.
[02:16:36.894 --> 02:16:37.895]  No, that makes you upset.
[02:16:38.575 --> 02:16:39.075]  Skip the break.
[02:16:40.176 --> 02:16:48.641]  But here we are in the year 2023, and I'm getting major newspapers calling me this week saying, word is it's set to be leaked.
[02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:49.281]  Okay, great.
[02:16:49.321 --> 02:16:50.102]  Knock yourselves out.
[02:16:52.063 --> 02:16:54.024]  I'd run around naked on TV if it saved the planet.
[02:16:56.371 --> 02:17:00.054]  So, that's where we are.
[02:17:01.536 --> 02:17:04.999]  And I remember with the lawyers and crew, they're like, well, how are you going to deal with this?
[02:17:05.019 --> 02:17:05.860]  We haven't gone to the phone yet.
[02:17:07.561 --> 02:17:12.806]  And I went, well, there's, there's nothing, there's no gay porn on my phone, so I'm not worried.
[02:17:12.826 --> 02:17:14.147]  Whatever they meant, well, let's go through the phone.
[02:17:14.828 --> 02:17:15.649]  Who, what is this?
[02:17:15.769 --> 02:17:17.390]  And I go, well, you can see my wife right there.
[02:17:18.051 --> 02:17:18.892]  That's, that's my wife.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:20.640]  Sending that to me.
[02:17:21.461 --> 02:17:25.043]  And I think the whole thing's cute and funny, but that's all they got.
[02:17:25.283 --> 02:17:28.244]  Am I smuggling kidnapped kids over the border, drugged up on fentanyl?
[02:17:29.285 --> 02:17:30.405]  Am I molesting children?
[02:17:31.646 --> 02:17:32.727]  Am I murdering people?
[02:17:33.447 --> 02:17:34.548]  Am I swindling people?
[02:17:34.568 --> 02:17:38.170]  Like FTX and Bernie Madoff?
[02:17:38.210 --> 02:17:38.430]  No.
[02:17:38.930 --> 02:17:40.551]  Am I Black Rock trying to run your life?
[02:17:40.571 --> 02:17:41.071]  No, man.
[02:17:41.351 --> 02:17:42.612]  I have sex with my wife.
[02:17:42.872 --> 02:17:43.652]  You better believe it.
[02:17:44.493 --> 02:17:48.475]  In fact, every day, let's just get that straight, I got a great sex life.
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:52.320]  You pissed off about that?
[02:17:55.981 --> 02:18:00.843]  So, the reason I raise this is it's all meant to embarrass people.
[02:18:01.603 --> 02:18:17.948]  And imagine, they've gone through everything Trump's got with hundreds of lawsuits, four criminal indictments, 80 plus charges, trying to scare people to lie about him to not go to prison, and they haven't gotten anybody yet to even lie about the guy.
[02:18:20.169 --> 02:18:20.889]  That's all you got?
[02:18:25.251 --> 02:18:27.251]  And that's why Elon Musk is joining us.
[02:18:27.251 --> 02:18:40.451]   It's because they're about to cut his firstborn son's genitals off.
[02:18:40.643 --> 02:18:42.704]  His firstborn son thinks he's a woman.
[02:18:44.145 --> 02:18:49.145]  And as a father, if my son, Rex Jones, 21, a badass.
[02:18:49.145 --> 02:18:57.945]   Imagine if my son thought he was a woman, and my son was in some cult
[02:18:57.945 --> 02:19:01.704]  that was about to cut his testicles off, I'd be pissed.
[02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.870]  And that's the thing.
[02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:17.317]  As the New World Order abuses more and more and more and more people, it's gonna make more and more enemies.
[02:19:17.917 --> 02:19:34.266]   And they've taken our Our calm, and our reserve, and our thoughtfulness as weakness, when it's the opposite.
[02:19:34.366 --> 02:19:42.489]  But at the end of the day, we're going to stop them launching nuclear war or die trying, and they will be brought to justice.
[02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:51.492]  And not because I'm a vindictive person, but because these scum need to be made an example of, so future trash doesn't try this again.
[02:19:56.314 --> 02:19:59.116]  And so yeah, the very same groups that have done this to me.
[02:20:02.398 --> 02:20:13.386]  Imagine I got sanctioned for a ton of money for my lawyer turning over nine months at one of my phones.
[02:20:15.687 --> 02:20:22.372]  And I'm sanctioned for not turning anything over when I gave these people everything because I had nothing to hide.
[02:20:23.833 --> 02:20:24.614]  But see, they don't care.
[02:20:25.626 --> 02:20:26.226]  They spin it.
[02:20:26.946 --> 02:20:34.089]  And now President Trump is told, Mar-a-Lago isn't worth $200 million as it is on the tax rolls.
[02:20:34.529 --> 02:20:42.512]  We're going to take all your property in New York, your golf courses, your hotels, your high-rises, because you're a fraud.
[02:20:43.052 --> 02:20:45.373]  And I'm a judge with Bozo the Hair Clown.
[02:20:46.254 --> 02:20:47.214]  Bozo the Clown Hair.
[02:20:49.645 --> 02:20:51.947]  You make yourselves a joke by all this.
[02:20:52.287 --> 02:20:58.532]  You think the world's gonna care when you put a picture of my penis on television?
[02:21:02.375 --> 02:21:07.013]   You think I'm gonna go away and crawl under some rock because you did that?
[02:21:07.013 --> 02:21:14.125]   They're children folks They're idiots.
[02:21:16.533 --> 02:21:20.156]  That's gonna blow up in their face, like everything else they've done.
[02:21:24.198 --> 02:21:29.602]  No weapon formed against us will prosper.
[02:21:30.583 --> 02:21:31.343]  So say it to the Lord.
[02:21:33.385 --> 02:21:41.751]  See, I don't have anything to hide, but they spin everything I do into some nightmare fraud, hoping you believe it.
[02:21:43.072 --> 02:21:51.134]  You think I told a federal bankruptcy court I don't have millions of dollars and then I've got 50 million dollars or 500, 400 million?
[02:21:51.615 --> 02:21:54.936]  No, obviously they're liars and it's all coming home to roost.
[02:21:56.376 --> 02:22:05.059]  And it's going to come home to roost on every single thing they've done to persecute all of us together.
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:09.200]  And they're stupid.
[02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:11.481]  They don't even know.
[02:22:12.677 --> 02:22:15.238]  Putting all these lies out against us makes us bigger.
[02:22:15.738 --> 02:22:18.199]  They think one-dimensionally they're not that smart.
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:27.562]  So here's President Trump saying, man, I wish I could have a jury trial.
[02:22:30.883 --> 02:22:32.504]  Imagine how fundamental that is.
[02:22:32.544 --> 02:22:33.184]  Of course, don't worry.
[02:22:35.333 --> 02:22:37.595]  They're having the jury trial on how guilty he is.
[02:22:38.135 --> 02:22:40.977]  Elon Musk said, what's happening to Trump is wrong.
[02:22:41.257 --> 02:22:42.778]  You're not guilty until proven innocent.
[02:22:43.038 --> 02:22:43.539]  Excuse me?
[02:22:46.906 --> 02:22:51.448]  When you're defaulted by a judge, you're guilty until proven how guilty.
[02:22:51.868 --> 02:22:53.930]  There's no innocent when you're found guilty.
[02:22:54.630 --> 02:23:00.953]  You're guilty until proven how guilty after they put on a show trial in front of the jury.
[02:23:01.613 --> 02:23:03.714]  In New York, it's almost 80% Democrat.
[02:23:03.954 --> 02:23:05.675]  DC, 93% Democrat.
[02:23:09.157 --> 02:23:14.720]  And these Democrats literally think they're fighting Adolf Hitler when they destroy you in these juries.
[02:23:17.022 --> 02:23:23.044]  They don't have a lick of sense, an ounce of chivalry.
[02:23:23.904 --> 02:23:25.544]  We would never treat them like that.
[02:23:26.845 --> 02:23:27.945]  Because we're not stupid!
[02:23:28.885 --> 02:23:33.727]  We fundamentally know when you treat somebody else bad, wrongly, it comes back on you.
[02:23:33.947 --> 02:23:35.247]  We're God-fearing people.
[02:23:35.467 --> 02:23:36.287]  They're not, folks.
[02:23:37.408 --> 02:23:38.548]  They think there's no rules.
[02:23:38.588 --> 02:23:39.908]  They think nothing applies to them.
[02:23:40.308 --> 02:23:43.349]  Oh, there are rules in this universe, and they do apply to you.
[02:23:43.549 --> 02:23:44.509]  And here's my frustration.
[02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:45.590]  You're scum.
[02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:46.190]  You're trash.
[02:23:49.770 --> 02:23:50.971]  I don't even want to destroy you.
[02:23:50.991 --> 02:23:52.172]  I just want you out of my universe.
[02:23:53.273 --> 02:24:01.600]  I don't take pleasure in the fact that you're such garbage, or the fact that you're so failed, or the fact that you're so spiritually weak, and ugly, and disgusting.
[02:24:04.062 --> 02:24:07.004]  Because the Great Awakening's here, and you're not going to stop it.
[02:24:08.384 --> 02:24:19.424]   So play Trump and then play the judge, Arthur Agron or whatever the hell his name is, telling
[02:24:19.424 --> 02:24:24.943]   a college class years ago that, "Well, if I don't like what a jury does, I just ignore
[02:24:24.943 --> 02:24:26.384]  it or just don't even have a jury."
[02:24:27.219 --> 02:24:28.320]  If I get emotional.
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.702]  The number one rule is a judge isn't emotional.
[02:24:31.922 --> 02:24:32.603]  They follow law.
[02:24:32.803 --> 02:24:41.369]  But he's telling young people who are going to be judges and lawyers in a law class, do what feels good.
[02:24:42.861 --> 02:24:44.242]  Do what you want.
[02:24:44.462 --> 02:24:46.944]  Do as thou wilt is the whole of the law.
[02:24:47.004 --> 02:24:47.484]  Here it is.
[02:24:48.345 --> 02:24:49.826]  Well, I think that was very good.
[02:24:49.846 --> 02:24:53.269]  That last five minutes was outstanding.
[02:24:55.390 --> 02:25:04.897]  Because the judge essentially conceded that the statute of limitations that we want at the court of appeals is in effect.
[02:25:05.658 --> 02:25:08.460]  Therefore, about 80% of the case is over.
[02:25:09.813 --> 02:25:28.601]  I was going to come out and say that, as you know, we're not entitled to a jury, which is pretty unusual in the United States of America, so we think it's very unfair that I don't have a jury, but the judge's last statement was very fair, and if I read it right, I'll let perhaps one of the lawyers speak to it.
[02:25:29.461 --> 02:25:31.262]  Now, I'm going to say something controversial.
[02:25:31.282 --> 02:25:34.604]  Even though I'm being taped, juries get it wrong a lot.
[02:25:34.644 --> 02:25:35.244]  That's my own opinion.
[02:25:35.063 --> 02:25:40.063]   seems to interpret that is that the Statue of Voted Nations is a very real thing in this
[02:25:40.063 --> 02:25:41.063]  country.
[02:25:41.063 --> 02:25:46.103]   Now, I'm going to say something controversial, even though I'm being taped.
[02:25:46.103 --> 02:25:47.943]  Juries get it wrong a lot.
[02:25:47.943 --> 02:25:49.263]  That's my own opinion.
[02:25:49.263 --> 02:25:55.703]   I do only civil trials, personal injury cases, contract disputes.
[02:25:55.703 --> 02:26:02.863]   But I've had situations where like, oh my, my, heaven's sake, how could they have thought
[02:26:02.863 --> 02:26:03.143]  that?
[02:26:03.143 --> 02:26:13.142]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:26:04.286 --> 02:26:08.950]  Well, I have a, I have a tool that I can deal with that.
[02:26:09.130 --> 02:26:13.553]  It's called jury notwithstanding the verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
[02:26:14.154 --> 02:26:24.869]   I can say there is no possible way that a reasonable jury would have reached that conclusion And, alright, am I following the law or am I making law?
[02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:35.892]  Okay, I'm following law, I'm an impartial referee, but it's hard to factor out my own emotions.
[02:26:36.693 --> 02:26:37.873]  And I have tools.
[02:26:39.294 --> 02:26:43.875]  Somebody can say, well, your honor, you have to throw out this case because it's just like another case.
[02:26:44.810 --> 02:26:46.791]  Well, is it just like another case?
[02:26:47.352 --> 02:26:50.134]  What if the defendant was wearing a red sweater instead of a blue sweater?
[02:26:50.894 --> 02:26:55.738]  Oh, and by the way, I worked for the Columbia Daily Spectator for a couple of weeks.
[02:26:56.538 --> 02:26:57.980]  What happened was I went there every day.
[02:26:59.248 --> 02:27:00.728]  And I wrote a few stories.
[02:27:02.029 --> 02:27:12.172]  One I got criticized on because I wrote that some Ku Klux Klan-ers had murdered some people, and I was told, you can't say that, how do we know?
[02:27:12.252 --> 02:27:12.952]  You weren't there.
[02:27:12.972 --> 02:27:14.952]  Well, that was what everybody thought.
[02:27:14.972 --> 02:27:17.373]  Anyway, yeah, we should have absolute immunity.
[02:27:17.933 --> 02:27:20.074]  What if we defame somebody?
[02:27:21.234 --> 02:27:22.314]  That's how it usually comes out.
[02:27:22.695 --> 02:27:27.296]  You know, you call somebody a murderer or a heroin addict, that sort of thing, a pedophile.
[02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:31.834]  If it's done in court, yeah, I think we should have absolute immunity.
[02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:37.782]  In court, he can tell any lie he wants.
[02:27:38.402 --> 02:27:40.926]  So you're not supposed to have judges nullify the law.
[02:27:41.186 --> 02:27:42.247]  It's in the Constitution.
[02:27:42.367 --> 02:27:42.908]  Juries.
[02:27:43.449 --> 02:27:45.892]  What they teach now, jury nullification is a no-no.
[02:27:47.406 --> 02:27:58.756]  In a strictest sense, jury nullification occurs when a jury returns a not guilty verdict, even though jurors believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has broken the law, but they do not believe the law is being properly applied.
[02:28:00.217 --> 02:28:03.860]  That's the power of we the people, not Bozo the Clown.
[02:28:04.921 --> 02:28:06.102]  Not this freakazoid.
[02:28:09.966 --> 02:28:13.389]  So in court, he says it, they can make up any lie they want.
[02:28:14.778 --> 02:28:34.393]  And you had people being taught by that guy, like the judge in Austin, that told the jury, this man is a liar and this man is guilty, and we're going to put a financial expert on that never saw your finances and say you got $400 million, and I had less than $3 million in the company account, then barely enough to pay the payroll.
[02:28:37.896 --> 02:28:40.158]  And they got up in front of a federal court and said the same thing.
[02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:42.952]  But the federal court didn't buy in it.
[02:28:43.712 --> 02:28:44.452]  They got a problem.
[02:28:45.273 --> 02:28:47.454]  So now they moved on to Elon Musk, the very same group.
[02:28:47.674 --> 02:28:50.255]  How do you kill a story that's about to come out with a new one?
[02:28:50.795 --> 02:28:51.735]  Oh, Elon Musk.
[02:28:53.336 --> 02:28:54.717]  So that's the enemies I've got.
[02:28:54.837 --> 02:28:56.898]  The same enemies trying to take down Elon Musk.
[02:28:57.478 --> 02:28:59.078]  The same enemies trying to take down President Trump.
[02:28:59.258 --> 02:29:01.559]  I'm here, reaching millions a day, thanks to you.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:04.721]  And I'm telling you, I need your support.
[02:29:06.681 --> 02:29:10.143]  I'm literally debating and battling a budget for next year.
[02:29:11.894 --> 02:29:14.455]  To be able to cover RNC-DNC, the border, all of it.
[02:29:15.015 --> 02:29:17.676]  We got the RV, the guy's ready, trying to hire back more reporters.
[02:29:17.996 --> 02:29:18.857]  Don't have the funds for it.
[02:29:19.117 --> 02:29:21.118]  Yeah, we're in the black, we're able to stay open, but that's it.
[02:29:22.038 --> 02:29:29.581]  I need you to decide to go to InfoWarsaw.com and get DNA Force Plus, and get Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, the strongest tumor out there, the incredible things tumor does.
[02:29:29.781 --> 02:29:30.501]  It's the best there is.
[02:29:30.801 --> 02:29:35.283]  And Real Red Pill Plus, my goodness, you heard the callers, you read the reviews, what it does, it's incredible!
[02:29:37.005 --> 02:29:40.667]  It's a souped-up version of what medical clinics sell to super-charged old people.
[02:29:40.687 --> 02:29:42.448]  It does great for young people as well.
[02:29:42.468 --> 02:29:43.989]  If you're in sports or anything, you need it.
[02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:45.209]  That's 40% off.
[02:29:45.249 --> 02:29:47.330]  That sale ends in like a day and a half.
[02:29:48.351 --> 02:29:49.831]  Vitamineral Fusion back in stock.
[02:29:50.012 --> 02:29:58.956]  And, ladies and gentlemen, The Great Reset and The War for the World pre-order.
[02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:00.517]  It's in stock in our warehouse.
[02:30:00.737 --> 02:30:01.317]  My new book.
[02:30:01.958 --> 02:30:03.718]  Look how much thicker it is in The Great Reset.
[02:30:03.758 --> 02:30:04.879]  That was an excellent book as well.
[02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:06.720]  Look at that.
[02:30:07.865 --> 02:30:09.786]  It is a thick book, it is incredible.
[02:30:10.086 --> 02:30:14.268]  Let me tell you, overhead shot please, let me tell you what's in this book.
[02:30:14.889 --> 02:30:17.010]  And it was like 600 pages, we had to cut it down to 400.
[02:30:18.868 --> 02:30:22.949]  The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:30:23.229 --> 02:30:36.112]  And I recorded this, I wrote this, Kinnegan Lively, that is a great proofreader and researcher, went over everything I said and made sure all of it was bibliographed, all of it was footnoted, all of it was documented.
[02:30:36.852 --> 02:30:37.912]  That's what they did in this book.
[02:30:38.572 --> 02:30:43.173]  Every paragraph in here has been fact-checked.
[02:30:45.413 --> 02:30:46.614]  Forward by Stephen K. Bannon.

[02:31:08.574 --> 02:31:09.214]  Chapter 3.
[02:31:09.554 --> 02:31:11.674]  You're being modified against your will.
[02:31:12.194 --> 02:31:12.934]  And to what end?
[02:31:13.394 --> 02:31:14.135]  Chapter 4.

[02:31:47.319 --> 02:31:50.262]  They drink their own children's blood.

[02:31:54.465 --> 02:31:57.467]  Chapter 10, the COVID-19 lies and deception.

[02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:29.381]  It is well written.
[02:32:29.501 --> 02:32:30.822]  It is well documented.
[02:32:31.002 --> 02:32:32.544]  It is ready for war.

[02:32:42.272 --> 02:32:43.433]  We want to push it to number one.
[02:32:45.815 --> 02:32:47.016]  Amazon says deliver by the 24th.

[02:33:10.857 --> 02:33:11.757]  It is powerful.
[02:33:11.777 --> 02:33:20.699]  I want to say great job to Kent helping me get this done and cutting it down from 600, I don't know what it was, it was like 700 pages at one point.
[02:33:24.577 --> 02:33:25.697]  It's a big book.
[02:33:25.917 --> 02:33:27.238]  It's a fast read, though.
[02:33:28.078 --> 02:33:29.698]  Read a couple chapters a day.
[02:33:31.099 --> 02:33:32.359]  Donate copies of the library.
[02:33:32.419 --> 02:33:34.239]  Give it to your police chief, your county commissioners.
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:36.580]  Put it in the library.
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:38.440]  Just get the Great Awakening.
[02:33:39.781 --> 02:33:43.382]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:33:43.742 --> 02:33:46.642]  We don't just have their evil, their operation, what they're doing.
[02:33:46.963 --> 02:33:50.223]  We have the response and the counter to their tyranny.
[02:33:51.844 --> 02:33:52.644]  And I want to encourage you.
[02:33:54.312 --> 02:33:55.353]  To get to signed copies.
[02:33:56.914 --> 02:33:59.375]  Last time I almost killed myself signing these things.
[02:34:00.496 --> 02:34:03.858]  And so this time we're going to have a limited signed by me.
[02:34:05.119 --> 02:34:06.740]  And then at some point I'll announce it.
[02:34:06.820 --> 02:34:10.562]  We're going to go to a robot auto signer where you put your signature in a computer.
[02:34:11.042 --> 02:34:11.583]  It copies it.
[02:34:11.623 --> 02:34:12.303]  It perfectly does it.
[02:34:12.323 --> 02:34:13.284]  It's a legal signature.
[02:34:13.324 --> 02:34:14.044]  Presidents do that.
[02:34:14.064 --> 02:34:15.325]  The Defense Department does it.
[02:34:15.945 --> 02:34:19.588]  But at a certain point, and I'll announce what that is, I'm going to try to hand sign as many as I can.
[02:34:19.628 --> 02:34:21.269]  But I can't spend weeks doing this again.
[02:34:21.989 --> 02:34:25.451]  So you want the actual one signed by me?
[02:34:25.511 --> 02:34:28.413]  That's great, but if they're just as good an auto sign, it'll be my signature.
[02:34:29.813 --> 02:34:30.894]  It's me authorizing it.
[02:34:30.934 --> 02:34:31.354]  It's legal.
[02:34:31.414 --> 02:34:32.435]  It's lawful.
[02:34:32.495 --> 02:34:35.036]  It's recognized like auto sign or bearer sign.
[02:34:35.056 --> 02:34:35.617]  It's just as good.
[02:34:35.657 --> 02:34:39.538]   But if you want it hand signed by me, I'm going to do as many of these as I can.
[02:34:39.598 --> 02:34:40.359]  I'll check the orders.
[02:34:40.719 --> 02:34:41.559]  And when I'm done, I'm done.
[02:34:41.599 --> 02:34:45.342]  Because, I mean, I was up here some days four hours in a row signing these.
[02:34:45.823 --> 02:34:46.963]  And it was great because it funded us.
[02:34:47.003 --> 02:34:49.925]  We wouldn't be on air if it wasn't for the support for the last book.
[02:34:50.426 --> 02:34:51.426]  And so, get the book.
[02:34:51.747 --> 02:34:52.627]  Find the operation.
[02:34:53.008 --> 02:34:53.988]  Get your signed copies.
[02:34:54.128 --> 02:34:55.009]  Those are a fundraiser.
[02:34:55.249 --> 02:34:55.930]  Get the unsigned.
[02:34:55.970 --> 02:34:56.750]  It's a quarter of the price.
[02:34:56.770 --> 02:34:58.211]  I want to thank you for your support.

[02:36:19.247 --> 02:36:23.469]  She's taking over in about 10, 15 minutes from now from Australia with updates there.
[02:36:23.529 --> 02:36:27.530]  Big awakenings there with the removing the different globalist leaders that push the poison shots.
[02:36:28.170 --> 02:36:29.190]  And if you're like, well, that's Australia.
[02:36:29.210 --> 02:36:30.911]  Why do I care what's 18 hours away?

[02:36:33.872 --> 02:36:35.833]  We can learn a lot about what's happening and stand with them.
[02:36:36.173 --> 02:36:36.833]  They'll stand with us.
[02:36:38.755 --> 02:36:39.395]  Homewreckers!
[02:36:39.916 --> 02:36:45.939]  All the appliances the Biden administration plans to regulate more aggressively and basically ban.
[02:36:45.999 --> 02:36:46.539]  It's everything.

[02:36:57.084 --> 02:36:59.646]  And they've got all the companies that are going to be allowed to produce the new stuff.
[02:37:00.466 --> 02:37:03.728]  Pool pumps, battery chargers, ceiling fans.
[02:37:03.768 --> 02:37:05.849]  Yeah, you can't have natural gas heat in your pool.
[02:37:07.725 --> 02:37:08.565]  Dehumidifiers.
[02:37:08.805 --> 02:37:10.966]  I mean, just total takeover.
[02:37:10.986 --> 02:37:11.766]  Microwave ovens.
[02:37:11.826 --> 02:37:13.087]  Portable electric spas.
[02:37:13.827 --> 02:37:14.567]  Air compressors.
[02:37:15.928 --> 02:37:16.768]  Gas generators.
[02:37:16.788 --> 02:37:17.388]  Just everything.
[02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:20.189]  Oh, but China doesn't have to make any cuts.
[02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:25.111]  Report California looking to restrict travel for classic cars.
[02:37:25.131 --> 02:37:28.692]  Yeah, they're sending out letters to everybody that has their classic car registered.
[02:37:29.548 --> 02:37:33.609]  The state's like, oh, just register it with us, haha, it's a classic car, cute little license plate.
[02:37:34.149 --> 02:37:39.850]  Oh, hey, pretty soon we're not going to let you leave your car or drive your car because it's got too high of an emission.
[02:37:40.810 --> 02:37:45.311]  California probes classic car owners amid zero emission zone proposals.
[02:37:45.691 --> 02:37:48.952]  Hell, they want to take your kids, now they want to take your classic cars.
[02:37:49.012 --> 02:37:52.252]  Big article by Don Salazar on Infowars.com.
[02:37:52.852 --> 02:37:56.613]  Meanwhile, carbon for the globalists but not for thee.
[02:37:58.436 --> 02:38:00.017]  Rules for thee, not for me.
[02:38:01.718 --> 02:38:11.742]  New four billion Panasonic electric car EV battery factory in Kansas requires so much power the facility will need its own coal plant.
[02:38:13.083 --> 02:38:14.264]  And Biden has authorized it.
[02:38:14.684 --> 02:38:21.167]  So coal powers the electric cars, coal builds the electric cars, they're incredibly toxic to get the materials to build.
[02:38:22.227 --> 02:38:24.928]  They have a bigger carbon footprint until they get about 60,000 miles.
[02:38:25.648 --> 02:38:26.408]  Carbon's great though.
[02:38:26.428 --> 02:38:27.208]  I don't have a problem with that.
[02:38:27.228 --> 02:38:37.311]  The problems are so toxic, but they're sitting there telling you that you can't have coal to run your house, but they can have it to build their electric cars.
[02:38:37.871 --> 02:38:40.752]  Carbon for me, not for thee.
[02:38:41.713 --> 02:38:42.633]  Here's the actual article.
[02:38:43.253 --> 02:38:47.334]  EV battery factory will require so much energy it needs a coal plant to power it.
[02:38:49.115 --> 02:38:50.415]  Isn't that just cute?
[02:38:53.257 --> 02:39:00.823]  So that's how they operate, folks, and they mean business to bring you to your knees.
[02:39:01.283 --> 02:39:08.888]  The great meme that shows the guy riding along on the bicycle, he's got a stick in his hand, he says, the economy requiring actual production to keep moving.
[02:39:10.009 --> 02:39:12.451]  Well, let's just virtue signal with trillions of free money.
[02:39:12.851 --> 02:39:16.114]  Sticks the stick in the spokes, the bike flips over, he's hurt.
[02:39:16.594 --> 02:39:20.437]  Oh my God, greedy landlords and capitalists raise the price of everything.
[02:39:22.295 --> 02:39:33.545]  But the average landlord didn't get richer, but the big billionaires, they more than doubled their wealth, because they know exactly what they're doing, building a post-industrial world.
[02:39:35.207 --> 02:39:41.572]  I want to come back and hit what I mentioned in the first hour at nauseam, and that's a whole bunch of videos and reports.
[02:39:42.603 --> 02:39:47.526]  Of drugged babies and toddlers on fentanyl and other drugs being let across.
[02:39:47.566 --> 02:39:49.187]  The Border Patrol doesn't arrest them.
[02:39:49.527 --> 02:39:50.368]  They don't have IDs.
[02:39:50.408 --> 02:39:51.368]  Can't prove that they're kids.
[02:39:51.448 --> 02:40:00.093]  Biden, a few months ago, stopped the DNA testing of the children to prove that their parents are even remotely related.
[02:40:00.133 --> 02:40:01.034]  They can do it in one day.
[02:40:01.054 --> 02:40:03.275]  That's how fast and good it is.
[02:40:04.396 --> 02:40:04.636]  No.
[02:40:04.796 --> 02:40:05.636]  Oh, you drugged a kid.
[02:40:05.676 --> 02:40:06.297]  It's okay here.
[02:40:06.577 --> 02:40:07.357]  It's your kid.
[02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:08.278]  Just come on through.
[02:40:08.998 --> 02:40:09.759]  Come on through.
[02:40:10.984 --> 02:40:12.525]  And that's what the Border Patrol's told to do.
[02:40:13.025 --> 02:40:15.606]  And they go, well, we're following our orders.
[02:40:16.266 --> 02:40:19.527]  Just like the Nazis in Nuremberg in World War II.
[02:40:19.607 --> 02:40:21.308]  It's really wild.
[02:40:22.848 --> 02:40:24.689]  It's really unspeakable.
[02:40:25.409 --> 02:40:26.409]  And you watch these videos.
[02:40:26.429 --> 02:40:27.630]  I mean, I've got hours of it.
[02:40:28.530 --> 02:40:30.091]  They're just coming through with the drug kids.
[02:40:30.211 --> 02:40:34.192]  And a lot of times they're not with their parents, but that's okay.
[02:40:34.252 --> 02:40:35.732]  No ID, you're just turned loose.
[02:40:35.813 --> 02:40:36.873]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[02:40:38.217 --> 02:40:43.198]  But when you fly, though, the TSA is going to touch your genitals and train you to be a slave.
[02:40:43.218 --> 02:40:48.440]  They'll go in a microwave oven and get scanned because it's all dog training, training you for submission.
[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:51.420]  Remember, being a citizen now is being a schmuck.
[02:40:51.821 --> 02:40:55.922]  Being a citizen is being a slave until we take our republic back from these predators.
[02:40:56.242 --> 02:40:56.802]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:57.830 --> 02:41:09.198]  Be the first to get my new book, it's incredible, and fund the InfoWar, The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists and Launching the Next Great Renaissance at InfoWarStore.com, signed or unsigned.
[02:41:09.238 --> 02:41:15.243]  Again, the signed is a fundraiser to know you really funded the tip of the spear.
[02:41:15.343 --> 02:41:19.206]  I'm going to hand sign the first four or five thousand of these.
[02:41:21.387 --> 02:41:28.389]  If we get weeks behind on these, I'm going to go to an auto-pin, where I digitally sign a bunch of versions, and the auto-pin does it.
[02:41:28.429 --> 02:41:29.810]  It's legally the same signature.
[02:41:30.250 --> 02:41:31.230]  Supreme Court's ruled.
[02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:32.171]  The Justice Department's ruled.
[02:41:32.471 --> 02:41:33.111]  Everybody loves it.
[02:41:33.151 --> 02:41:34.291]  It still has great value.
[02:41:34.691 --> 02:41:44.055]  But if you want an actual signing by me, get your orders in right now, because when we start going, it might be in a month from now, I don't know how many of these I can sign, because I can't sign books two hours a day.
[02:41:44.375 --> 02:41:44.795]  I'm slow.
[02:41:45.655 --> 02:41:47.738]  We will put a notice that these are now auto-pinned.
[02:41:47.778 --> 02:41:48.820]  They're not auto-pinned.
[02:41:49.581 --> 02:41:53.627]  All the first orders that come in are going to be actually signed by me.
[02:41:54.127 --> 02:42:02.707]  And today, an 18-wheeler of 20,000 books showed up.
[02:42:02.707 --> 02:42:04.347]  So I'm going to try to--
[02:42:04.347 --> 02:42:08.187]  I'm going to sign 5,000 of these.
[02:42:07.304 --> 02:42:10.545]  And that's going to take probably 15 hours in the next few weeks.
[02:42:10.605 --> 02:42:13.407]  But so everybody that first orders is going to get it.
[02:42:13.527 --> 02:42:20.530]  And then if you go to the site later and you see auto pen signed, it's still my signature legally, but I'll do a bunch of versions in the computer.
[02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:26.512]  We just got one of the systems is randomly going to like sign it or whatever, uh, with a different version of my signature.
[02:42:26.532 --> 02:42:28.053]  Cause I, my signature changes a lot.
[02:42:28.393 --> 02:42:28.853]  That's how I am.
[02:42:28.873 --> 02:42:29.473]  I'm kind of weird.
[02:42:29.493 --> 02:42:32.156]   Uh, but we're, Regardless, it's a historic book.
[02:42:32.536 --> 02:42:33.377]  It's powerful.
[02:42:33.497 --> 02:42:33.977]  You need it.
[02:42:34.418 --> 02:42:37.781]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:42:37.841 --> 02:42:40.044]  Get it unsigned.
[02:42:40.324 --> 02:42:40.985]  Get a signed book.
[02:42:41.005 --> 02:42:43.627]  But I ask you to get the signed book because that funds our operation.
[02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:46.190]  It's at $99.99 to $100.
[02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:47.351]  Takes money to win a war.
[02:42:47.932 --> 02:42:50.634]  You will be getting an actual signed copy by me.
[02:42:51.194 --> 02:42:56.674]   And then as soon as we go to auto pin, when I'm overwhelmed, but everybody that gets their orders in now will get it.
[02:42:56.674 --> 02:42:59.974]   And then as soon as I do that, I'll say, okay, all previous orders get signed.
[02:42:59.974 --> 02:43:03.834]   I'm going to auto pin and that's even, somebody's got to set it up and do it.
[02:43:03.834 --> 02:43:07.413]   And that's a whole nother bailiwick and a whole nother kettle of fish,
[02:43:07.413 --> 02:43:09.594]  but that's what's happening.
[02:43:09.594 --> 02:43:13.834]   But it was the signed copies and the last book that kept us on air.
[02:43:13.977 --> 02:43:15.359]  That was the big game changer.
[02:43:15.699 --> 02:43:18.762]  The fact that this book hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list.
[02:43:19.102 --> 02:43:20.383]  The Great Reset and the War of the World.
[02:43:20.744 --> 02:43:22.105]  They would not review it.
[02:43:22.145 --> 02:43:23.206]  They would not say it won.
[02:43:23.226 --> 02:43:24.027]  They admitted it won.
[02:43:24.407 --> 02:43:25.589]  Number one Wall Street Journal.
[02:43:25.709 --> 02:43:26.209]  Number one.
[02:43:27.450 --> 02:43:31.434]  All the other sites, number one Amazon, number one USA Today.
[02:43:31.894 --> 02:43:34.937]  We want to push this new book that's even thicker and even more powerful.
[02:43:35.277 --> 02:43:37.799]  It's not just the latest enemy operation, it's how to counter them.
[02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:40.241]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:43:40.682 --> 02:43:45.086]  And the big sale on the Trifecta pack, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:43:46.046 --> 02:43:48.428]  And Real Red Bull Plus has to end Thursday morning.
[02:43:49.149 --> 02:43:50.670]  Vitamin Refusion is back in stock.
[02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:52.531]  Great CBD oil, the highest quality.
[02:43:52.571 --> 02:43:53.172]  It's all there.
[02:43:53.612 --> 02:43:54.973]  InfoWars Platinum back in stock.
[02:43:55.334 --> 02:43:56.314]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:56.334 --> 02:43:58.156]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:43:58.196 --> 02:43:59.137]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:43:59.517 --> 02:44:04.541]  You're the reason we're changing the world, and I salute you, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:44:05.862 --> 02:44:06.202]  Okay.
[02:44:07.543 --> 02:44:08.424]  Let me tell the story.
[02:44:08.444 --> 02:44:11.967]  We're going to go to break and have our guest host, Maria Z, take over, who always does a splendid job.
[02:44:14.841 --> 02:44:17.402]  The media is promoting black-on-white attacks.
[02:44:18.143 --> 02:44:20.564]  The media is saying white people are inherently evil and bad.
[02:44:20.985 --> 02:44:22.365]  Most black folks are wonderful people.
[02:44:22.445 --> 02:44:23.826]  I don't blame black people in general.
[02:44:24.326 --> 02:44:27.708]  Just like when the KKK was attacking people decades ago, it was still much smaller.
[02:44:28.329 --> 02:44:29.389]  I don't blame white people for that.
[02:44:29.409 --> 02:44:30.250]  I blame the KKK.
[02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:38.595]  But I was going to get a couple new shirts because my shirts are getting worn out at a mall I've been going to since I was a little kid here in Austin.
[02:44:39.195 --> 02:44:40.376]  I would come visit my grandparents here.
[02:44:40.396 --> 02:44:40.996]  I grew up in Dallas.
[02:44:44.935 --> 02:44:49.979]  It was literally gangbangers everywhere and I repeatedly was told by black people, what are you even doing?
[02:44:51.119 --> 02:44:53.241]  So that's how dangerous things have gotten.
[02:44:53.581 --> 02:44:56.944]  And that's how this race war that the Democrats have launched is going.
[02:44:58.825 --> 02:44:59.786]  21 black on white crime.
[02:45:01.887 --> 02:45:07.351]  And so black people see white people and they literally believe the minority of them, but they get together that we're the devil.
[02:45:08.889 --> 02:45:10.270]  The media covers up the statistics.
[02:45:10.290 --> 02:45:11.031]  Democrat Rep.
[02:45:11.591 --> 02:45:15.133]  Henry Cullier carjacked by three black males in Washington, D.C.
[02:45:18.275 --> 02:45:22.278]  Both these men tweeted at the creator of Dilbert and shared a horrific fate.
[02:45:22.618 --> 02:45:28.722]  Two men recently tweeted at Dilbert when he said, you know, things continue, you're going to be murdered.
[02:45:28.843 --> 02:45:30.444]  Both of them got murdered soon after.
[02:45:31.587 --> 02:45:32.407]  It's the same story.
[02:45:32.468 --> 02:45:33.828]  It's just explosive crime.
[02:45:34.228 --> 02:45:38.191]  Meanwhile, the giant lawlessness at the border is completely out of control.
[02:45:39.271 --> 02:45:40.352]  Owen covered this yesterday.
[02:45:40.392 --> 02:45:42.053]  We're going to repost this at Infowars.com.
[02:45:42.093 --> 02:45:44.794]  I'm going to cover it more tomorrow because it's such a big deal.
[02:45:45.635 --> 02:45:53.399]  But dozens of videos of drug babies, toddlers, you name it, being drugged through in and the Border Patrol admits they're not arresting them and not stopping them.
[02:45:53.679 --> 02:45:59.303]   So if you give your child some Painkillers, outside of prescription, they take your kid.
[02:45:59.884 --> 02:46:02.345]  Or if you give your kid a couple shots of Jack Daniels, you go to jail.
[02:46:03.225 --> 02:46:14.491]  But if there's illegal aliens bringing kids across the border, it's A-OK, because the Border Patrol is there to complete the smuggling process, and God knows where these children go, and now they don't do the DNA testing, going back two months.
[02:46:14.651 --> 02:46:18.093]  Biden killed that, which only takes a day to prove if it's even a relation.
[02:46:18.693 --> 02:46:22.815]  So roll some of the video right now of drugged out children, babies.
[02:46:23.195 --> 02:46:24.035]  Many of them are dying.
[02:46:24.055 --> 02:46:24.896]  I got articles right here.
[02:46:26.445 --> 02:46:27.005]  From the drugs.
[02:46:27.025 --> 02:46:28.506]  There they are, all drugged out.
[02:46:29.446 --> 02:46:30.887]  They don't cry, they don't complain.
[02:46:31.247 --> 02:46:32.468]  They can be carried across.
[02:46:34.209 --> 02:46:36.750]  Look at them, all completely drugged and passed out.
[02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:39.631]  And they say, yeah, the cartels drug them.
[02:46:39.911 --> 02:46:41.632]  And they're not in trouble, it's okay, alright.
[02:46:42.052 --> 02:46:44.553]  You came here, you let the cartels drug your kids, you're fine.
[02:46:45.394 --> 02:46:48.915]  Guests of migrant children haunt former official as border surge increases.
[02:46:49.476 --> 02:46:49.936]  NPR.
[02:46:50.959 --> 02:46:52.180]  Two children dead in one day.
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.721]  Baby girl condition after attempted border crossings from the drugs they were on.
[02:46:56.121 --> 02:47:01.924]  Baby girl among four dead in Texas authorities in Rio Grande River, US, Mexico in just the last 48 hours.
[02:47:02.304 --> 02:47:02.925]  Overhead shot.
[02:47:03.405 --> 02:47:04.725]  Let's show TV viewers this.
[02:47:05.066 --> 02:47:06.746]  This is what the Democrats are guilty of.
[02:47:07.027 --> 02:47:10.088]  This is what we're all guilty of letting them do it, but they're more guilty than us.
[02:47:10.608 --> 02:47:11.008]  Look at that.
[02:47:11.449 --> 02:47:11.969]  NPR.
[02:47:13.951 --> 02:47:20.596]  NBC, CBS, four dead little kids in 48 hours at one crossing, mainly from the drugs.
[02:47:22.557 --> 02:47:28.721]  Meanwhile, three Disney workers, school athletic director among 219 arrested in Florida, human trafficking sting.
[02:47:29.181 --> 02:47:30.742]  This is the reality.
[02:47:32.624 --> 02:47:34.205]  This is the dehumanization.
[02:47:36.486 --> 02:47:38.308]  This is the crimes being committed.
[02:47:39.164 --> 02:47:53.529]  Babies on fentanyl and nothing's done to the parents and nothing's done to the cartels because our government is facilitating all of it while they shake their finger at you and say you're inherently bad because you're a white person.
[02:47:54.110 --> 02:48:00.172]  And then a minority of black people and others then literally believe mugging and killing and home invading.
[02:48:02.386 --> 02:48:10.910]  Conservatives is a good thing, because we're white, we're inherently bad, and they teach school children as young as five, that's the case.
[02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:14.051]  Gangs from Central and South America entering the U.S.
[02:48:14.111 --> 02:48:17.772]  and targeting luxury homes all over the country, New York Post.
[02:48:19.632 --> 02:48:27.153]   Let's go out to break with Hochul, the New York appointed mayor, in 2001 saying, "Come here,"
[02:48:27.153 --> 02:48:34.112]   and in 2023 saying, "Don't come here." Now they want to think you don't have a memory,
[02:48:34.112 --> 02:48:40.632]   and now they want you to just forget what happened, and now they want you to go to sleep and say it's not their
[02:48:40.632 --> 02:48:42.351]  fault, it's Trump's fault.
[02:48:42.591 --> 02:48:44.011]  That's what they want you to believe.
[02:48:44.331 --> 02:48:50.653]  Maria Zee of Zee Media, 3ZEEMEDIA.COM is about to kick some ass.
[02:48:51.153 --> 02:48:55.174]  And then, soon-to-be-political-president turns himself into jail for a free speech.
[02:48:55.234 --> 02:49:01.476]  The judge said, Owen Schroyer takes over in about 46 minutes at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:49:01.716 --> 02:49:04.756]  He's paying a great price for liberty, but nothing compared to a lot of people.
[02:49:05.077 --> 02:49:06.517]  Realize, we're in the fight!
[02:49:07.037 --> 02:49:09.398]  They're trying to get through us to get to you.
[02:49:09.758 --> 02:49:10.578]  We believe in you.
[02:49:10.658 --> 02:49:11.599]  We stand with you.
[02:49:11.839 --> 02:49:16.321]  But we need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your support at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:49:16.361 --> 02:49:17.181]  I want to salute the crew.
[02:49:17.201 --> 02:49:19.102]  I want to thank everybody for the great job they've done.
[02:49:19.122 --> 02:49:28.985]  I want to just ask listeners, go to InfoWarStore.com today and get The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist New World Order and launch this great renaissance.
[02:49:29.585 --> 02:49:30.406]  Get it now.
[02:49:30.866 --> 02:49:31.986]  Get involved in history.
[02:49:32.066 --> 02:49:32.847]  Take action.
[02:49:33.187 --> 02:49:35.988]  Here's that clip of the governor, and then Maria Z takes over.
[02:49:37.168 --> 02:49:46.995]  As you know, the Statue of Liberty is inscribed, it says, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled young masses yearning to be free, the wretched refuse to a teeming shore.
[02:49:47.535 --> 02:49:50.857]  And that statement encapsulizes our values.
[02:49:51.357 --> 02:49:59.083]  We want people to come here, despite where they came from, or despite the circumstances that drove them to this country and to this state.
[02:49:59.563 --> 02:50:01.224]  We say you are welcome here.
[02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:04.486]  You're welcome with open arms and we'll work to keep you safe.
[02:50:04.987 --> 02:50:06.928]  We'll not only house you, but we'll protect you.
[02:50:07.788 --> 02:50:11.750]  So our message to the world is, send us your people.
[02:50:11.810 --> 02:50:18.473]  Send us those who need the cloak of comfort that we can demonstrate as New Yorkers with big hearts and open arms.
[02:50:18.753 --> 02:50:20.174]  We'll provide a safe haven.
[02:50:20.214 --> 02:50:25.116]  We have to let the word out that when you come to New York, you're not going to have more hotel rooms.
[02:50:25.156 --> 02:50:26.217]  We don't have capacity.
[02:50:26.257 --> 02:50:30.059]  So we have to also message properly that we're at our limit.
[02:50:30.959 --> 02:50:32.800]  If you're going to leave your country, go somewhere else.
[02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:36.522]  But the smarter thing is to apply for asylum before you leave your country.
[02:50:37.469 --> 02:50:47.472]  And now from Australia, the mighty Maria Z. Thank you so much, Alex, and to the whole team at InfoWars.
[02:50:47.532 --> 02:50:50.313]  I'm so excited about the release of his new book.
[02:50:50.393 --> 02:50:51.994]  I have the last one that he wrote.
[02:50:52.094 --> 02:50:52.914]  It's fantastic.
[02:50:52.994 --> 02:50:55.675]  And so I'm asking everyone that's watching to support.
[02:50:55.855 --> 02:50:56.695]  I'll be doing it.
[02:50:57.295 --> 02:51:01.897]  I always look for ways to support Alex and the crew because this broadcast is so important.
[02:51:01.957 --> 02:51:04.448]   And this is Let me just say something.
[02:51:04.529 --> 02:51:08.790]  Alex addressed before that news out of Australia, why is it important?
[02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:14.372]  Well, it's important for the whole world because we're not only, we're no longer dealing with local issues.
[02:51:14.392 --> 02:51:18.774]  A United States problem is an Australia problem.
[02:51:19.274 --> 02:51:22.255]  An Australia problem is a United States problem.
[02:51:23.328 --> 02:51:32.015]  What Alex has just been talking about with the border and Cathy Hochul talking about, you know, previously, oh, come in and then no, don't come in.
[02:51:32.696 --> 02:51:42.644]  Once they've realised the devastating effects of the UN replacement migration strategy, the UN is at the heart and the root of all of these problems.
[02:51:43.585 --> 02:51:48.409]  And right now we have a situation in Australia that is crucial for everyone to understand.
[02:51:49.648 --> 02:51:53.351]  We have what's called The Voice being proposed.
[02:51:53.711 --> 02:51:57.633]  Let me explain to you why this matters for every single person everywhere in the world.
[02:51:58.434 --> 02:52:00.896]  This is not an Australian agenda.
[02:52:01.676 --> 02:52:04.278]  It is driven by the United Nations.
[02:52:05.018 --> 02:52:05.619]  I'll explain.
[02:52:06.229 --> 02:52:21.879]  What they're saying is that they want to change our constitution to give Aboriginal people a voice in the constitution, but they're not going to tell us what changes are going to be made to the constitution until after we vote yes.
[02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:23.901]  Why are they doing that?
[02:52:24.241 --> 02:52:25.342]  Well, it's very, very simple.
[02:52:25.382 --> 02:52:45.298]   The United Nations, under their UNDRIP documents, require states to change their laws To pretend that they're elevating the indigenous people of the land and actually implement advisory bodies that do not really represent them so that they can steal the land of the country.
[02:52:46.744 --> 02:52:50.507]  And I wanted to bring a very, very important guest on today.
[02:52:50.987 --> 02:52:52.508]  Her name is Grandmother Malara.
[02:52:52.548 --> 02:52:57.812]  She's an Aboriginal senior law woman who also holds a Juris Doctor in Colonial Law.
[02:52:58.132 --> 02:53:02.135]  She's joined me before and she is doing a phenomenal job exposing this.
[02:53:02.655 --> 02:53:06.898]  If there really was an Aboriginal voice, it would belong to someone like her.
[02:53:06.938 --> 02:53:13.739]   But the Australian Electoral Commission, who's currently tweeting out, Potentially encouraging people to vote multiple times.
[02:53:13.779 --> 02:53:15.061]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:53:15.962 --> 02:53:18.525]  Has been determined to silence her.
[02:53:18.585 --> 02:53:21.349]  Grandmother Malara, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:22.691]  We really appreciate your time.
[02:53:22.711 --> 02:53:24.974]  Hello, Maria.
[02:53:24.994 --> 02:53:25.995]  Good to be here.
[02:53:27.446 --> 02:53:28.787]  It's wonderful to see you again.
[02:53:28.867 --> 02:53:35.754]  So I've given a little bit of an overview for people to understand what The Voice is actually about and explained how it's not just an Australian issue.
[02:53:35.794 --> 02:53:43.422]  In fact, they've been doing this in Canada and it's already caused devastating outcomes for the Indigenous communities there.
[02:53:44.583 --> 02:53:50.707]  They're doing this under the guise of biodiversity and it all goes back to the UN 30 by 30 agenda.
[02:53:50.988 --> 02:53:58.233]  I made a promise to you that I was going to find the links to the UN with the voice and I've done that.
[02:53:58.273 --> 02:54:00.735]  That report's coming out later on this week.
[02:54:01.016 --> 02:54:06.580]  But I want to hear about how the Australian government is actually silencing your voice.
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:07.801]  Talk us through this journey please.
[02:54:10.686 --> 02:54:23.237]  On social media, where I'm putting information out and talking to people about and publishing videos with other elders, talking about our perspective and saying, no, we don't want this.
[02:54:24.298 --> 02:54:30.243]  This is going to force us to contract with the corporate government, which is not duly elected.
[02:54:30.303 --> 02:54:32.545]  It's unlawful.
[02:54:33.151 --> 02:54:37.053]  But apart from that, we have our own laws and we have our own way of governing.
[02:54:37.414 --> 02:54:40.455]  And so, you know, good, bad or otherwise.
[02:54:41.036 --> 02:55:00.688]  But the whole UN agenda is to take charge, take over the lands and the Electoral Commission, they have put a blanket stop on all of us that do not conform to the Electoral Commission's format.
[02:55:02.540 --> 02:55:05.062]  Yes, I want to bring that up on the screen right now, team.
[02:55:05.102 --> 02:55:09.766]  If you can get... Sorry, only those saying no, though.
[02:55:09.786 --> 02:55:13.168]  They're not doing it to anyone that's... Yes, yes.
[02:55:14.609 --> 02:55:15.250]  Yes, of course.
[02:55:15.270 --> 02:55:17.311]  I want to get that image up on the screen, team.
[02:55:17.351 --> 02:55:18.793]  If you can bring image one up.
[02:55:19.233 --> 02:55:25.097]  I've actually made sure that we've blocked out Grandmother Malara's personal information on that letter.
[02:55:25.137 --> 02:55:27.980]  That's a letter from the Australian Electoral Commission.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:42.534]   What this letter says Because Grandmother Malara, who's actually not only qualified, but as an elder in the community, she is the most qualified to speak on these issues.
[02:55:42.950 --> 02:56:00.575]  The Australian Electoral Commission, which is responsible for, you know, this referendum, is saying that they have, because Grandmother Malara has been speaking on this issue that affects her people directly, she doesn't have approval to speak on this.
[02:56:01.055 --> 02:56:13.599]   Because they passed a law right before they announced the referendum that whether you are promoting or opposing This referendum, you have to get their approval.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:17.322]  Grandmother Malara, you are an Aboriginal elder.
[02:56:17.362 --> 02:56:23.125]  Do you need the approval of the Australian Electoral Commission to speak on behalf of your people?
[02:56:23.145 --> 02:56:23.185]  No.
[02:56:24.306 --> 02:56:31.230]  In fact, they probably need our approval to even run a referendum that concerns us.
[02:56:33.211 --> 02:56:37.914]  How on earth do people think that they can make a decision regarding somebody else?
[02:56:39.571 --> 02:56:40.516]  Via a referendum.
[02:56:42.011 --> 02:56:57.999]  Well, you know, it's very, very similar to other campaigns that are driven by the government, where they get celebrities to come and say that they're voting yes, and write songs that apparently represent the Aboriginal people's voice, when in fact that is not the case.
[02:56:58.039 --> 02:57:07.384]  And if the team can, I've sent some B-roll footage to them to show there have been protests around the country where the tribal people are saying, we do not want this.
[02:57:07.644 --> 02:57:10.906]  The people are standing with them saying, we know exactly what this is about.
[02:57:11.826 --> 02:57:20.868]  And so I want to ask you, Grandmother Malara, are the tribal people aware that this is going to actually cause them to lose their sovereignty?
[02:57:20.908 --> 02:57:28.970]  Because right now, your Aboriginal law is above the colonial law as far as your community is concerned, and it is a fact.
[02:57:31.571 --> 02:57:35.832]  Yes, we have the law of the land, and they wanting it, because they want the land.
[02:57:36.673 --> 02:57:38.154]  They want to sell the land.
[02:57:38.174 --> 02:57:41.156]  The UN is behind this move for sure.
[02:57:42.017 --> 02:57:47.601]  So the tribal people do not want this voice whatsoever.
[02:57:47.621 --> 02:57:49.762]  They do not want this referendum full stop.
[02:57:50.303 --> 02:57:59.569]  And it's only what we call the corporate blacks that are behind it or the people who are paid to promote the yes camp.
[02:57:59.769 --> 02:58:05.113]  Those who are paid, who are going to get a paid position perhaps in such a body.
[02:58:05.512 --> 02:58:07.797]  It's actually only voting for a body.
[02:58:08.278 --> 02:58:13.910]  It's not voting, a corporate body that is, it's not even voting really for anything to do with us.
[02:58:14.010 --> 02:58:15.694]  They're just calling it in our name.
[02:58:18.692 --> 02:58:24.838]  Yes, and this is exactly what I'm going to detail in the report being released later this week.
[02:58:24.878 --> 02:58:26.820]  Everyone, that'll be up on zmedia.com.
[02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:30.924]  It's a very detailed report about the UN, 30 by 30.
[02:58:31.284 --> 02:58:36.810]  In fact, Greg Rees has reported on this previously, but we really just go and expand on it.
[02:58:37.230 --> 02:58:44.253]  The UN 30 by 30, which they're going to come in and say, oh, because of conservation, we need to conserve this land.
[02:58:44.533 --> 02:59:00.562]   And by the way, the Council of Foreign Relations says not only 30 percent do we need to conserve and make inaccessible to humans, It's actually 50 or maybe even 80% of the land that we need to conserve and they want no one to be able to access it.
[02:59:00.642 --> 02:59:02.803]  And who stands in the way of that right now?
[02:59:02.863 --> 02:59:11.609]  See, Grandmother Malara, I actually believe that Australia is in a stronger position than many countries because the tribal people stand in the way of the UN doing this.
[02:59:13.130 --> 02:59:13.731]  We know that.
[02:59:14.791 --> 02:59:21.316]  Whether our fellow Australians know that or not is almost irrelevant, although it is relevant coming to a vote.
[02:59:22.367 --> 02:59:26.608]  We know that we are standing in the way because we have not ceded our sovereignty.
[02:59:27.128 --> 02:59:31.929]  We hold the law of this land and we will always hold the law of this land.
[02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:39.630]  And that's the obligation for me as a senior lawwoman is to stand up for the land and for our law.
[02:59:40.050 --> 02:59:42.150]  It cannot be taken from us in this way.
[02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:51.752]  And it's a slate of hand effort to try and sell off our country, sell off our land.
[02:59:52.165 --> 02:59:57.548]  For those to the UN, to corporate mining giants, to other corporations.
[02:59:58.088 --> 03:00:06.693]  And if we look at who is funding the Yes campaign, it's not only a bankrupt government, but it's also many, many corporations are involved.
[03:00:07.114 --> 03:00:12.137]  We don't have one cent being supported, sponsored to the What No campaign.
[03:00:12.657 --> 03:00:14.458]  That speaks volumes in and of itself.
[03:00:15.058 --> 03:00:17.860]  So we are holding the fort here.
[03:00:18.689 --> 03:00:21.872]  And we are going to stop this from happening.
[03:00:22.312 --> 03:00:32.162]  And in stopping it in Australia, we are stopping it for the whole New World Order to take over the entire global landscape.
[03:00:33.463 --> 03:00:35.765]  Well, this is crucial, what you've just said.
[03:00:36.426 --> 03:00:47.426]   Because if people understand the UNDRIP documents, In fact, the convention that they had earlier this year says that every single country needs to implement this.
[03:00:47.946 --> 03:00:57.211]  So Australia right now, as with many, many other things, is the test bed for this UN takeover, which will facilitate the smart city implementation.
[03:00:57.511 --> 03:01:00.372]  Because they'll say, oh, this is heritage land.
[03:01:00.672 --> 03:01:12.761]   They'll pretend that Indigenous peoples have spoken for this land, when in fact, They haven't been consulted in the process and they'll say no one's allowed here because we need to conserve it for the indigenous peoples.
[03:01:12.861 --> 03:01:18.786]  This is how it's going to operate and they're saying that this needs to happen in every single country.
[03:01:18.826 --> 03:01:23.350]  This is how smart cities will be achieved because people will only be allowed in certain areas.
[03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:27.212]  So, as you just said, Australia's standing in the way of this.
[03:01:27.332 --> 03:01:42.959]  If we can show an example to the world of, no, actually we need to stand with the original custodians of this land and realise that they're standing in the way of the entire New World Order, this is colossal!
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:47.341]  We are aware of that, and we are.
[03:01:49.733 --> 03:01:50.714]  It just cannot happen.
[03:01:50.774 --> 03:01:53.856]  We will never, ever cede our sovereignty.
[03:01:54.396 --> 03:01:58.699]  Most of us do not want a treaty, words of a treaty.
[03:01:58.759 --> 03:01:59.699]  That's a contract.
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:02.061]  We don't want that with our government.
[03:02:02.081 --> 03:02:07.764]  And because we don't have that with our government, the corporate government, they can't come in and take over.
[03:02:08.365 --> 03:02:20.706]   But in every other country, bar Russia, I think, there has been a treaty between the original sovereign peoples and the colonial Governments, for want of a better word.
[03:02:21.247 --> 03:02:22.667]  So we're the only ones that haven't.
[03:02:23.027 --> 03:02:25.508]  So therefore, we're going to stop the whole thing.
[03:02:27.908 --> 03:02:30.109]  Yes, I'm so encouraged by you.
[03:02:30.129 --> 03:02:34.310]  I just find you to be such a woman of such integrity and strength.
[03:02:34.670 --> 03:02:40.711]  And I'm so, so glad to see the people in our country standing up to this and realising what it really is.
[03:02:40.751 --> 03:02:53.158]   If there's one good thing that is coming out of this New World Order attempt to take over the world, It's the awakening of the masses to the fact that they cannot trust their governments.
[03:02:53.539 --> 03:02:55.325]  Something your people should know very well.
[03:02:56.335 --> 03:03:02.340]  Because our government certainly has never cared about the traditional custodians of this land.
[03:03:02.781 --> 03:03:05.303]  I don't think they plan on starting to care about them now.
[03:03:05.743 --> 03:03:16.492]  The human rights abuses that have happened around the world in the name of conservation of indigenous people are many, and the UN and, you know, all their NGOs are linked to many of them.
[03:03:16.512 --> 03:03:25.039]  When we come back from this break, I want to talk about how they're actually, they've been targeting you, silencing you, taking your videos down.
[03:03:25.539 --> 03:03:33.042]  Where you are displaying the will of the elders in this country and how the AEC is potentially trying to rig the votes.
[03:03:33.342 --> 03:03:35.583]  Don't go anywhere, this is crucial for everyone.
[03:03:35.803 --> 03:03:36.463]  We'll be right back.
[03:03:36.883 --> 03:04:11.865]   You know, it's absolutely hilarious because of the unbelievable groundswell of resistance to this so-called voice The Prime Minister has even had to address the UN conspiracy, as he calls it, saying that, oh, you know, there's all these conspiracies going around, that the UN's going to take the land and, you know, and I think thus far, as I mentioned to Grandmother Malara before, thus far, we've really not had the documentation to prove it.
[03:04:11.905 --> 03:04:17.587]  But I do, I've got the receipts and it's coming out this week and I can't wait to share it with Australia and the whole world.
[03:04:18.287 --> 03:04:20.068]  Grandmother Malara is here with me.
[03:04:20.288 --> 03:04:24.589]  She's an Aboriginal senior law woman who also holds a Juris Doctorate in Colonial Law.
[03:04:25.009 --> 03:04:35.311]  She's absolutely one of the most qualified people to speak on this issue and yet the Australian Electoral Commission and it seems Big Tech have been attacking her.
[03:04:35.411 --> 03:04:39.172]  One of your videos got pulled down from the internet.
[03:04:40.333 --> 03:04:45.514]  Please talk to us about what was contained in that video and why they pulled it down.
[03:04:47.555 --> 03:04:51.136]  It's the very first broadcast I made on my thoughts of the voice.
[03:04:52.056 --> 03:04:53.077]  And it got pulled down.
[03:04:53.097 --> 03:04:55.117]  Mind you, it took them four months to find it.
[03:04:55.237 --> 03:04:59.399]  But it got pulled down because it had well over a million views.
[03:05:01.439 --> 03:05:05.201]  It was a surprise to me how popular it was going to be, but well over a million views.
[03:05:05.661 --> 03:05:11.883]  And it was telling the truth with law and law, both LORE and LAW.
[03:05:11.983 --> 03:05:12.923]  And I was telling the truth.
[03:05:13.576 --> 03:05:30.445]  And so when I got the Electoral Commission letter, what was attached to it was a copy of a brochure that someone else had put together, which was all of the words that I'd had on that video in written form.
[03:05:30.905 --> 03:05:33.847]  And they had a QR code to it linked to the video.
[03:05:34.605 --> 03:05:38.528]  One version of it and on one platform, I mean.
[03:05:39.289 --> 03:05:47.095]  And therefore, it's interesting that I had that pulled, that video was pulled off Vimeo, which I'm a personal subscriber to.
[03:05:47.775 --> 03:05:48.376]  They pulled it.
[03:05:49.877 --> 03:05:52.279]  So then I quickly put it on another platform.
[03:05:53.079 --> 03:05:55.821]  So we're jumping ahead of them.
[03:05:55.881 --> 03:06:01.566]  If they think that we're going to take their slap in the face as a slap in the face, they've got another thing coming.
[03:06:02.210 --> 03:06:06.974]  We have many ways in which very clever people, which we can deal with them.
[03:06:07.054 --> 03:06:09.176]  So that was a big surprise.
[03:06:09.977 --> 03:06:24.589]  And of course, on social media, Facebook, et cetera, wherever I'm being pushed by our digital warriors, they're now getting what they call fact-checked.
[03:06:25.450 --> 03:06:30.694]  But then we found that the fact-checkers themselves have been caught lying.
[03:06:31.420 --> 03:06:33.728]  So it's a real circus over here.
[03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:37.212]  It's an absolute circus.
[03:06:38.152 --> 03:06:44.357]  I mentioned to you on the phone yesterday that I am actually deeply offended on your behalf.
[03:06:45.138 --> 03:07:03.213]  And the reason is because everywhere you look, radio ads, TV ads, constantly yes campaign in your face telling me that if I don't vote yes, I'm a racist and this is going to give the Aboriginal people a voice.
[03:07:03.633 --> 03:07:13.636]  And yet I know an elder and she's sitting in front of me right now and her videos are being pulled down and she's getting fact checked by RMIT, who's now been disbanded because they've been exposed.
[03:07:14.716 --> 03:07:15.756]  RMIT fact check.
[03:07:16.076 --> 03:07:20.098]  So, you know, I mean, where is your voice in this?
[03:07:20.198 --> 03:07:22.018]  Where is your voice, Grandmother Malara?
[03:07:23.698 --> 03:07:32.721]  It's a very good question, but I'll tell you what, I am being called into many meetings with concerned people.
[03:07:33.799 --> 03:07:37.901]  Who want to help us and promote the truth.
[03:07:38.462 --> 03:07:39.142]  That's what we want.
[03:07:39.202 --> 03:07:39.943]  We want the truth.
[03:07:40.783 --> 03:07:46.186]  And we don't want this garbage UN takeover in disguise as the voice.
[03:07:46.846 --> 03:07:54.250]  This voice notion is only to set up another corporate body to receive funds.
[03:07:54.330 --> 03:07:55.911]  So where's my voice?
[03:07:56.532 --> 03:07:57.812]  Well, I'm here speaking with you.
[03:07:57.872 --> 03:07:58.893]  Thank you very much, Maria.
[03:08:02.705 --> 03:08:10.469]  You mentioned something crucial there because UNDRIP actually talks about things like reparations and collecting compensation and things like that.
[03:08:11.390 --> 03:08:14.454]   And again, That's not going to go to your people.
[03:08:14.514 --> 03:08:20.258]  That's going to go to the corporation that's set up pretending that it's representing the Aboriginal people.
[03:08:20.298 --> 03:08:21.299]  This is how it always works.
[03:08:21.339 --> 03:08:24.681]  In fact, we have many of those structures already in place.
[03:08:25.802 --> 03:08:31.386]  The Australian government collects and distributes millions upon millions of dollars every year.
[03:08:31.406 --> 03:08:33.688]  And yet, who actually gets that money?
[03:08:35.609 --> 03:08:36.330]  It's a good question.
[03:08:36.370 --> 03:08:38.992]  And in fact, I think it might even be in the billions, the money.
[03:08:39.871 --> 03:08:47.074]  It goes to, there are over 3,000 Aboriginal corporations already set up in this country.
[03:08:47.534 --> 03:08:48.415]  Who needs another one?
[03:08:48.955 --> 03:08:55.878]  But this particular one, the VOICE body, will take control of the whole of Australia.
[03:08:56.358 --> 03:09:05.522]  At this point in time, the other Aboriginal corporations that they've set up are in various states and in various regional areas.
[03:09:06.149 --> 03:09:09.712]  Or they're doing certain other tasks.
[03:09:10.212 --> 03:09:16.137]  But none of the money goes to our actual tribal people that really need it.
[03:09:16.317 --> 03:09:20.741]  We don't have our own people who are poor.
[03:09:21.001 --> 03:09:22.062]  They're living in poverty.
[03:09:22.182 --> 03:09:25.185]  We're in third world, even less than third world country conditions.
[03:09:25.965 --> 03:09:31.350]  They get not one cent from their own people who are sitting on a land council.
[03:09:32.170 --> 03:09:38.059]  And a corporate land council get funding from the corporate government to do their bidding.
[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:41.564]  We are in trouble if this voice goes through.
[03:09:41.625 --> 03:09:45.070]  In fact, I'd almost predict there could be social unrest.
[03:09:47.298 --> 03:10:09.312]   Well I wouldn't be surprised and let me tell you if it does go through I would almost say that it's a surefire sign that we have rigged elections because there is so much opposition to this and I know from the Aboriginal people there is a You know, unsurmounting, maybe that's not the word, there is so much opposition.
[03:10:09.873 --> 03:10:16.621]  I want to bring up, Tim, if you can bring up the image too from the Australian Electoral Commission.
[03:10:16.641 --> 03:10:28.829]   They were responding to people on X and they actually said here, if someone votes At two different polling places because again this is going to a referendum vote next, well this month now.
[03:10:29.269 --> 03:10:39.312]  If someone votes at two different polling places within their electorate and places their formal vote in the ballot box at each polling place, their vote is counted.
[03:10:39.352 --> 03:10:49.816]   My response to this on X This can actually be taken as the Australian Electoral Commission signalling to people how to rig this referendum.
[03:10:50.136 --> 03:10:51.857]  What are your thoughts on this, Grandmother Malara?
[03:10:53.518 --> 03:10:54.419]  It's extraordinary.
[03:10:54.799 --> 03:10:57.080]  It would definitely be unconstitutional.
[03:10:58.100 --> 03:11:00.802]  One person, one vote is constitutional.
[03:11:00.842 --> 03:11:05.124]  Here we are voting about a constitutional change in an unconstitutional manner.
[03:11:06.564 --> 03:11:07.385]  It's extraordinary.
[03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:11.352]  They should be saying, you can only vote once.
[03:11:11.372 --> 03:11:15.434]  They shouldn't be saying, oh, vote more than once and you might be able to get away with it.
[03:11:16.995 --> 03:11:18.356]  It's unbelievable, isn't it?
[03:11:18.636 --> 03:11:19.717]  I mean, here's the thing.
[03:11:20.117 --> 03:11:28.702]  They followed up saying, oh, you know, these cases are very rare, usually from people that may have mental health issues or whatever.
[03:11:28.742 --> 03:11:41.889]   But the point is, you're not supposed to, as you just outlined perfectly, you're not supposed to be promoting the possibility of voting multiple times You are supposed to be telling people how they should not be doing this.
[03:11:42.030 --> 03:11:46.111]  One more very, very important image I want to bring up on the screen.
[03:11:46.171 --> 03:11:47.272]  Team Image 3.
[03:11:47.692 --> 03:11:56.595]  This is a Member of Parliament, allegedly, that posted this and it was amended very quickly because it went viral.
[03:11:57.136 --> 03:11:59.817]  Can't vote in person on October 14th.
[03:11:59.877 --> 03:12:00.377]  Good news!
[03:12:00.697 --> 03:12:05.819]  The AEC have now released the early voting locations for this particular electorate.
[03:12:06.411 --> 03:12:10.213]  And she goes on to hashtag vote often.
[03:12:10.594 --> 03:12:21.381]  The timing of a member of parliament saying to people to vote often while the AEC are telling you how you can effectively rig this referendum.
[03:12:21.861 --> 03:12:23.482]  I mean, this is astounding.
[03:12:26.964 --> 03:12:28.025]  I don't even know what to say.
[03:12:28.765 --> 03:12:31.527]  It's just, it's unprecedented.
[03:12:32.910 --> 03:12:33.851]  Is probably the word.
[03:12:34.411 --> 03:12:48.483]  And it looks like they're preparing to lay the foundation for people to accept that there will be multiple voting by one person and more than one person.
[03:12:48.503 --> 03:12:49.144]  That it's coming.
[03:12:51.005 --> 03:12:52.847]  Well, you know, there was a viral clip.
[03:12:52.907 --> 03:13:04.557]   I don't have it with me today, but basically there was a viral clip of a Yes campaigner That spat on someone and, you know, this went everywhere and basically assaulted this person.
[03:13:04.917 --> 03:13:09.943]  And this is really the mental state of some of these people that are buying into the government lie.
[03:13:10.243 --> 03:13:15.208]  So it wouldn't surprise me if they went around and voted multiple times after that signal from the AEC.
[03:13:15.568 --> 03:13:16.209]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:13:16.229 --> 03:13:18.992]  We're back with Grandmother Malara straight after this break.
[03:13:19.782 --> 03:13:27.485]  And we are back here with Grandmother Malara, who's a high-ranking, very respected Aboriginal elder.
[03:13:27.505 --> 03:13:34.467]  I want to ask you, Grandmother Malara, about, you know, some of the things that they did to your community during COVID.
[03:13:34.847 --> 03:13:38.470]  And this pretending of the government that they actually care about the Aboriginal people.
[03:13:39.250 --> 03:13:51.920]  I was contacted by a former Northern Territory police sergeant who sent me footage of them injecting Aboriginal people in remote communities under a tree, no gloves, rubbish sitting next to them.
[03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:57.524]  This is how they deem appropriate health care for those remote communities apparently.
[03:14:01.038 --> 03:14:01.699]  They bribed.
[03:14:02.039 --> 03:14:10.507]  So first of all, they came in force and our people are a little bit of, you know, there's a fear about people in uniform because we've had it.
[03:14:10.547 --> 03:14:16.853]  We've got a history of having our children taken away by police coming in over the years.
[03:14:16.893 --> 03:14:18.015]  I won't go into that right now.
[03:14:18.055 --> 03:14:25.662]  But what it is, is when they come in in uniform in particular and in a large number of them, it's very scary.
[03:14:26.479 --> 03:14:27.319]  That's on one hand.
[03:14:27.379 --> 03:14:29.260]  The other hand is they get bribed.
[03:14:30.001 --> 03:14:33.142]  Oh, we'll give you $500 if you take this.
[03:14:33.262 --> 03:14:36.604]  Or you'll get tickets to the football and bring your friends.
[03:14:36.684 --> 03:14:41.527]  Although a bribery going on for people to, you know, to take the jab.
[03:14:42.247 --> 03:14:51.452]  In effect, what that effect has happened, and we really tried hard to stop it, telling the communities, this isn't what you think it is.
[03:14:52.052 --> 03:14:55.594]  But then they've got their own corporate blacks in their land council.
[03:14:56.297 --> 03:15:00.738]  who are influencing that takeover.
[03:15:01.158 --> 03:15:10.381]  We are now having so many funerals, many more than we would have ever had before in a short span of time.
[03:15:10.781 --> 03:15:12.021]  We are losing our elders.
[03:15:12.061 --> 03:15:22.804]  We believe that they were trying to take out our elders who held the songlines, who held the knowledge, who held law, who held the stories, who held the dreaming.
[03:15:23.905 --> 03:15:26.572]  They were aiming to wipe us out.
[03:15:29.169 --> 03:15:36.253]  For anyone who isn't aware, within Aboriginal culture, they're very, very aware of the funerals that are happening.
[03:15:36.933 --> 03:15:41.875]  It's very common for people to be aware of, I think, probably all over the country.
[03:15:41.935 --> 03:15:43.816]  Correct me if I'm wrong here, Grandmother Malara.
[03:15:43.856 --> 03:15:50.119]  So, when you say that there are much more funerals happening, especially as an elder, you would know this.
[03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:52.180]  It's not just, you know, your opinion.
[03:15:52.441 --> 03:15:55.142]  You're actually verifiably able to prove this.
[03:15:56.813 --> 03:15:57.353]  That's true.
[03:15:57.794 --> 03:16:01.356]  I myself have been to three funerals within the span of three weeks.
[03:16:02.777 --> 03:16:05.719]  You know, it's been very sad to see this happen.
[03:16:06.239 --> 03:16:11.663]  And there's a lot of us who are reeling from, we've lost some very, very important elders.
[03:16:12.244 --> 03:16:13.785]  And that's why we must step up.
[03:16:14.365 --> 03:16:15.466]  All of us must step up.
[03:16:16.186 --> 03:16:18.728]  And those of us holding the law have stepped up.
[03:16:19.489 --> 03:16:23.230]  And you asked me earlier before the break, Maria, where am I finding my voice?
[03:16:23.290 --> 03:16:29.051]  My voice is being spoken through the law, through other law keepers.
[03:16:29.451 --> 03:16:35.953]  And in fact, I had one group contact me for my permission to show that first broadcast.
[03:16:36.253 --> 03:16:43.455]  They're driving all around their community to show that first broadcast and they wanted my permission and I gave them my blessing, of course.
[03:16:45.546 --> 03:16:46.507]  Well, I'm so glad.
[03:16:46.547 --> 03:16:51.772]  I'm so glad that you're making an amazing difference to Australia, but not just Australia.
[03:16:52.173 --> 03:16:55.416]  I want everyone to understand this is for the whole world.
[03:16:55.796 --> 03:16:57.278]  This is going to stop.
[03:16:58.281 --> 03:17:07.492]  If we successfully vote no or successfully put an end to this, this is going to stop the UN takeover of Australia, at least for now.
[03:17:08.233 --> 03:17:12.298]  It is so crucial for the whole world to rally around this.
[03:17:16.269 --> 03:17:17.630]  About the communities, right?
[03:17:17.650 --> 03:17:27.014]  They say, the government, claims that this advisory board or advisory body is going to be able to speak for all of the communities.
[03:17:27.954 --> 03:17:30.035]  That's not how the communities work.
[03:17:30.215 --> 03:17:37.099]  There are, I mean, everyone has to give their input and there are so many communities.
[03:17:37.359 --> 03:17:42.221]  Just give us a rundown of how this is impossible that an advisory board could speak for them all.
[03:17:44.110 --> 03:17:46.391]  Well, you know, even I can't speak for them all.
[03:17:46.952 --> 03:17:52.214]  I can only speak for what I hold, the knowledge that I hold, the wisdom that I'm keeping.
[03:17:53.935 --> 03:17:56.517]  So there's over 250 tribes here.
[03:17:58.318 --> 03:18:04.521]  We're calling them nations because we've picked up that word from the American Native Indian people.
[03:18:05.082 --> 03:18:07.803]  And so the nations, we have over 250 nations.
[03:18:07.823 --> 03:18:10.124]  There were over 500 before the British came 230 years ago.
[03:18:13.707 --> 03:18:17.090]  We're down to roughly 250, maybe a bit more.
[03:18:17.571 --> 03:18:21.374]  Each of those groups have their own tribal boundaries.
[03:18:21.535 --> 03:18:24.717]  They have their own particular law, LORE.
[03:18:25.158 --> 03:18:27.780]  In my country, we call it, let's say, Williaroo Law.
[03:18:28.381 --> 03:18:34.704]   In Central Australia, it might be called The Chukapa over in the Kimberley, it'll be called the Wanjina.
[03:18:35.624 --> 03:18:38.726]  Over in the eastern part of Australia, it's called Bayami.
[03:18:39.247 --> 03:18:51.796]  We have our own creation laws, why the landscape has been formed the way it is, what are the particular jobs and obligations we have as custodians to keep everything alive in our area.
[03:18:52.376 --> 03:18:53.577]  So, we have our particular law.
[03:18:53.597 --> 03:19:10.064]  There are protocols that span the entire continent, so we're sort of like one mob as far as the protocols go, but we are very different in terms of how we put that into place and what area we're kind of boss of, you might say.
[03:19:10.084 --> 03:19:12.946]  So, you can't speak.
[03:19:15.612 --> 03:19:17.175]  I was just about to summarise.
[03:19:17.195 --> 03:19:24.989]  You can't speak for others and you certainly aren't going to have a government that's currently not listening to even one of those groups.
[03:19:28.224 --> 03:19:35.428]  All of a sudden representing all of those groups and as you put it, you know, each group has its own tribal boundaries.
[03:19:35.468 --> 03:19:58.080]   So if our own government, let me paint it this way, if our own government that are physically and geographically and even maybe in their understanding closer to the Aboriginal people in Australia, how on earth is the UN going to understand All of these boundaries and tribal nuances, if you will.
[03:19:59.541 --> 03:20:08.140]   Well, number one, they've set up native title legislation, which is to put boundaries around
[03:20:08.140 --> 03:20:15.581]   what area comes under a particular group versus what area doesn't.
[03:20:15.581 --> 03:20:21.260]   And they really made a big effort to do that so that they could quarterise, if you like,
[03:20:21.260 --> 03:20:27.060]   all of those boundaries and then have the UN come in and say, "Okay, we know who's
[03:20:27.060 --> 03:20:34.742]   where, but it's the native title legislation that is not really for our people."
[03:20:34.742 --> 03:20:44.742]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:20:37.116 --> 03:20:38.796]  Sorry, I've just got a cough.
[03:20:39.377 --> 03:20:44.242]   So under native title, You cannot own private property.
[03:20:45.283 --> 03:20:46.884]  It's all communal land.
[03:20:47.945 --> 03:20:54.952]  So, if you can imagine, the voice then comes in over the top and rules all of those corporate bodies.
[03:20:56.854 --> 03:20:59.276]  It's what they say goes, because follow the money.
[03:21:00.497 --> 03:21:01.678]  That's where the money comes from.
[03:21:01.958 --> 03:21:06.663]  It'll be, they have to do what the voice body tells them to do.
[03:21:08.058 --> 03:21:18.860]  That there will be no question in my mind and in my other brothers and sisters' minds, the tribal brothers and sisters, that this is a big takeover and that's how it's going to happen.
[03:21:19.620 --> 03:21:27.382]  In fact, everyone will lose their title to land because your interests, your rights is in the title to the land.
[03:21:27.962 --> 03:21:39.719]   So even people who aren't original people who live here, Their own land titles, their certificate of title has already been digitised.
[03:21:40.760 --> 03:21:42.021]  They don't have a hard copy.
[03:21:42.061 --> 03:21:43.502]  It's already happening.
[03:21:44.023 --> 03:21:58.896]  And all those digital titles will all then be masked and they have already, some have already been masked in a state and sold off to a private enterprise, a private corporation in another country.
[03:21:59.679 --> 03:22:04.841]  And that is like a lien to raise funds against selling off our land.
[03:22:05.522 --> 03:22:08.923]  And then they can come in and our land is rich in mineral resources.
[03:22:10.564 --> 03:22:11.505]  So there's a lot of reasons.
[03:22:13.237 --> 03:22:17.838]  Grandmother Malara, you know, I could talk to you all day about this because the agenda is so vast.
[03:22:17.899 --> 03:22:25.601]  And again, you are definitely, in my opinion, one of the most important people to speak about this.
[03:22:26.401 --> 03:22:37.445]  You should be the one on the Parliament steps that they're promoting, that they've spoken to you and all of the community members that this actually affects, but that is not what this is.
[03:22:37.905 --> 03:22:40.045]  Again, you mentioned the land titles.
[03:22:40.084 --> 03:22:44.543]   This is something that Tom Renz spoke about with me, I believe, on this broadcast, where
[03:22:44.543 --> 03:22:49.464]   he spoke about the fact that these were digitised now and it was basically a digital ledger
[03:22:49.464 --> 03:22:52.324]  and this is how they were going to seize assets worldwide.
[03:22:52.324 --> 03:22:55.003]  This is not just an Australian problem.
[03:22:55.003 --> 03:23:00.564]   The voice is just the mechanism that they're doing it in Australia and, you know, there's
[03:23:00.564 --> 03:23:01.884]  a different tactic everywhere.
[03:23:01.934 --> 03:23:10.478]  But I'm telling you now, look up UNDRIP and wait for this report later on this week, everyone, because it's going to really detail how they're going to do it everywhere.
[03:23:10.858 --> 03:23:12.819]  Grandmother Malara, we're out of time today.
[03:23:12.839 --> 03:23:20.643]  You can find more information on Grandmother Malara's website, grandmotherwisdom.com.

[03:23:26.886 --> 03:23:28.386]  Because this is the real voice.
[03:23:28.547 --> 03:23:32.788]  It's listening to the community elders and representatives.
[03:23:33.348 --> 03:23:34.548]  We're so grateful for your time.
[03:23:34.588 --> 03:23:43.211]  I just really want to mention to everyone, I conducted an interview with Mark Steele, 5G weapons expert, just really breaking down this October 4th EBS.

[03:24:00.893 --> 03:24:01.793]  [cheering]

[03:26:07.242 --> 03:26:09.203]  We don't have a lot of market for this.
[03:26:09.503 --> 03:26:11.564]   So that is It is an insanely good deal.

[03:26:27.915 --> 03:26:30.376]  We sell it for 30-something percent.
[03:26:30.396 --> 03:26:31.297]  33% under what they sell it for.
[03:26:31.317 --> 03:26:32.158]  It's their biggest discount.
[03:26:32.498 --> 03:26:33.739]  I had to really hammer them.
[03:26:33.779 --> 03:26:38.322]  It took six months of negotiations to get the lowest price, and then they private-labeled it for us.
[03:26:39.002 --> 03:26:45.226]  Under the name Rebels In, because all their other distributors will get mad that are selling it because we've undercut them.
[03:26:45.246 --> 03:26:48.128]  So we private-labeled it to be able to give you that quality.

[03:27:00.657 --> 03:27:07.854]   And on top of that, Just a few days left on the Trifecta sale.
[03:27:07.874 --> 03:27:13.136]  40% off on DNA Force Plus, Bodies Whole with Turmeric Formula, and of course, the real Red Pill Plus.

[03:27:14.457 --> 03:27:16.498]  Get it for yourself and keep the broadcast on air.
[03:27:16.778 --> 03:27:24.242]  I mean, literally, if they said, it will defeat the new order right now, if you climb into a wood chipper, I'd say, turn the son of a bitch on.
[03:27:24.482 --> 03:27:25.262]  I wouldn't even think about it.
[03:27:25.282 --> 03:27:26.603]  I'd jump headfirst into it.
[03:27:27.834 --> 03:27:28.254]  Wait, wait, wait.
[03:27:28.274 --> 03:27:34.377]  If God said, if you climb into that woodchip right now, we'll defeat this, we'll stop this right now, I'd say, please, turn it on full power.
[03:27:34.737 --> 03:27:36.598]  Now, I'm not into pain, so I wouldn't go feet first.
[03:27:36.658 --> 03:27:41.640]  I'd say, turn that son of a bitch on high, and I would climb right in and stick my head right in there.
[03:27:41.660 --> 03:27:42.120]  Okay?
[03:27:43.501 --> 03:27:45.402]  Because these people are pedophiles.
[03:27:45.442 --> 03:27:46.702]  These people are Satanists.
[03:27:47.002 --> 03:27:48.743]  They've got to be opposed.
[03:27:49.043 --> 03:27:50.644]  They've got to be resisted.
[03:27:50.904 --> 03:27:52.605]  We've got to stand against them.
[03:27:52.885 --> 03:27:55.266]  So just spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:27:56.434 --> 03:27:58.255]  Just spread the word and share the links.
[03:27:58.295 --> 03:27:58.835]  You've been doing it!
[03:27:58.895 --> 03:28:00.076]  And we're beginning to win!
[03:28:01.497 --> 03:28:10.461]  And just go to InfoWarsStore.com and get InfoWars Platinum and get Vitamineral Fusion and get the trifecta operation before that sale has to end.
[03:28:11.041 --> 03:28:14.123]  I can't drive a car if the gas is not in the tank!
[03:28:14.803 --> 03:28:15.424]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:15.444 --> 03:28:15.864]  Stay with us.
