[00:00:00.353 --> 00:00:02.755]  Now, a lot of you don't know how Alex came here.
[00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:04.256]  You don't know how he came to be here.
[00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:06.158]  How would Alex come to the river?
[00:00:06.178 --> 00:00:09.060]  Well, I've known him for a long time, and here now we're talking.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.961]  I said, Alex, I want to bless you.
[00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:12.382]  I'm going to bring you here.
[00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:13.663]  I'm going to put you in a resort.
[00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:15.165]  I'm going to look after you.
[00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.166]  I want you to rest with your wife and your daughter.
[00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:19.548]  And so they came in Tuesday.
[00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:21.289]  They're going to leave Wednesday next week.
[00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.910]  We've been looking after them.
[00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.732]  It's just he can't stop working.
[00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:31.550]   So he's supposed to be on the beach but no he's going to go live to rip the globelists to shreds.
[00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:41.151]  But I really, I really wanted him to rest.
[00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:42.055]  I really.
[00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:46.556]  And he has been.
[00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:47.677]  He says, I've been resting.
[00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:50.237]  Sure.
[00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:52.798]  And I'm the new Pope.
[00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:55.783]  Okay.
[00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:55.943]  Oh yeah.
[00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:56.484]  Yeah, if you're resting.
[00:00:56.684 --> 00:00:59.366]  Yeah, I'll be in the Vatican tomorrow afternoon.
[00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:09.186]  (laughing)
[00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:16.186]   Oh yeah, yeah if you're resting, yeah, I'll be in the Vatican tomorrow afternoon.
[00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:20.186]  (laughing)
[00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:21.186]  Oh yeah.
[00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.186]  No.
[00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:28.110]  So, but I believe the Lord's been really just encouraging him and I really wanted to encourage him by bringing him.
[00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.674]  We've been looking after him and we're blessing him, his wife, his daughter and just looking after him.
[00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:36.617]  But this is what this church does.
[00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:41.981]  When I got arrested for keeping the church open, it's because they said I broke the law.
[00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:43.762]  There was no law.
[00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:47.325]  They said you broke the law and you endangered people's lives.
[00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:52.890]  We've never endangered anybody's life.
[00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:56.893]  We have not had one person die of COVID.
[00:01:58.454 --> 00:01:59.214]  Not one person.
[00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.578]  So, we have people die of old age.
[00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:06.379]  Are you with me?
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.261]  And you have to die sometime.
[00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:11.982]  Are you with me?
[00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:14.764]  Not tonight, please.
[00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:18.907]  But there's a job of work to be done.
[00:02:20.237 --> 00:02:26.161]  So one of the things, they don't want to preach in the gospel, that's why we give people opportunity to get saved, to get the life of the Lord.
[00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.684]  It's not about joining the church, it's about joining the family, which is so important.
[00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:33.525]  So I'm going to just say this to you tonight.
[00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:35.706]  If you die tonight, where would you go?
[00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:37.147]  Somebody said, I don't know.
[00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:39.569]  You need to make sure before you leave here.
[00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.610]  Somebody said, well, I'm not sure what I believe.
[00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.851]  You better find out quickly.
[00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:47.734]  You know, the time to find out what you believe is not when you're going over a cliff.
[00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:50.135]  Are you with me?
[00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:53.397]  You need to know exactly where you stand.
[00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.020]  And it's about surrender.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.082]  To say, yes, Lord, I give you my life.
[00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:01.424]  And that's what he's looking for today.
[00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:03.186]  He's looking for your life.
[00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:06.589]  People say, oh, God wants my money.
[00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.109]  He doesn't.
[00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.930]  He just wants you.
[00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.013]  He doesn't want, he's not interested.
[00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.674]  Do you think God needs anything?
[00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.176]  God doesn't lack one thing.
[00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.158]  But he's looking for you.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:30.589]  And if God can take this African boy, who many people threw away and said they'll never make it, never amount to anything, and brought me here with my wife all those years ago.
[00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.673]  I landed with $300, taking us to 88 countries of the world.
[00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:41.457]  You're on our campus here, 90 acres, beautiful big pavilion, the new sanctuary that's been done out.
[00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:43.198]  Somebody said, why weren't we in there tonight?
[00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:45.480]  You have to come Sunday mornings to come see that.
[00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:51.464]  And for special occasions, for Sunday morning, the main event.
[00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:56.166]  But I'm glad you came tonight.
[00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:00.609]  Can we do this right now?
[00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.010]  Just bow your heads for a second.
[00:04:06.073 --> 00:04:13.997]  And you that are watching by way of television, if you don't know Jesus today, and tonight was the last night on the earth, where would you spend eternity?
[00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:16.279]  I want you to just make right with God tonight.
[00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:23.921]  If you've never given your life for the Lord, what would happen if you went home, put your head on your pillow in the middle of the night?
[00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:25.803]  You passed.
[00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:26.543]  Where would you go?
[00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:32.408]  Somebody said, I'll leave it for another moment.
[00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:34.370]  No, you don't know when your moment will be.
[00:04:37.372 --> 00:04:40.215]  Tonight is your night of freedom.
[00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.638]  Will you surrender to him and say, yes, Lord?
[00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.979]  Yes.
[00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:52.512]  Maybe you hear, you say, I gave my life to the Lord years ago, but I'm not serving God like I should.
[00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:54.713]  My church closed down.
[00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:56.253]  I don't have a church.
[00:04:58.434 --> 00:05:01.175]  It's about having a personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:02.815]  He loves you.
[00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:05.136]  He loves you.
[00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:08.017]  He loves you so much.
[00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:14.558]  Then maybe you hear tonight, you say, I'm not sure.
[00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:16.799]  I don't have the assurance.
[00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:25.420]  I go to church, but I read my Bible, but I don't have the assurance that I'm a child of God, but I'd like to know tonight.
[00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:31.283]  If this is you and you fit into any one of these categories, I want to pray with you quickly.
[00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:38.007]  Right where you are, put your hand up right now and say, pray for me.
[00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:39.428]  Thank you, sir.
[00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:40.289]  Thank you, ma'am.
[00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:41.569]  Thank you over there.
[00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:42.230]  Thank you there.
[00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:43.991]  Thank you.
[00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:45.312]  Thank you.
[00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.912]  Your hands are going up everywhere.
[00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:50.912]  Everywhere.
[00:05:50.912 --> 00:05:54.912]  Listen, this is Alex's heart as well.
[00:05:54.912 --> 00:06:04.912]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:57.487 --> 00:06:02.092]  This morning he felt that Great Commission, and that's what's happening here tonight.
[00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:09.240]  I want every person that raised their hand to stand right where you are.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.100]  I want to stand right to your feet quickly.
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:21.100]  [Applause]
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.100]  I feel that there could be a few others.
[00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:29.259]  God's talking to you right now, your heart is pounding away, and you feel the Lord's calling you.
[00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.500]  Just quickly stand along with Him, and I'm gonna lead you in a prayer.
[00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:34.101]  I'm gonna lead you in a prayer tonight.
[00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:38.283]  Quickly, quickly, there's others.
[00:06:38.803 --> 00:06:42.764]  Just stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand.
[00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:44.105]  Stand right now.
[00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:45.725]  Stand right now.
[00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.487]  You're saying yes to Jesus!
[00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:52.158]  You're saying yes to Jesus?
[00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:53.639]  Yes, Lord!
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.101]  Yes!
[00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:56.862]  I'm not talking about religion.
[00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.504]  I'm not talking about a church.
[00:06:58.544 --> 00:06:59.985]  I'm not talking about a denomination.
[00:07:00.005 --> 00:07:01.307]  I'm talking about Jesus.
[00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:04.089]  Yes, Lord.
[00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:09.014]  Is there anybody else that would just stand along quickly before we pray?
[00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:11.036]  In your home, you're watching by television.
[00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:12.638]  Just stand right by your TV.
[00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:18.585]  This is live right now across America on Dish and DirecTV, on satellites around the world.
[00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:21.366]  They're watching us in Soviet Russia right now tonight.
[00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:23.187]  Or former Soviet Union, sorry.
[00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:24.067]  Moscow.
[00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:26.469]  They're watching us in Moscow.
[00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:28.730]  They're watching us in Hong Kong right now.
[00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.331]  Just stand in your home.
[00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:34.873]  Now I want you to look at me.
[00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:38.615]  If you mean business with God, God means business with you.
[00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:41.176]  And you might say, but Pastor, you don't know what I've done.
[00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:42.797]  It's none of my business.
[00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:46.310]  Someone says, you don't know what I've done and where I've been.
[00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.950]  No, I don't.
[00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.391]  But I know what Jesus has done and where he's been.
[00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:55.332]  And what Jesus has done and where he's been cancels out what you've done and where you've been if you believe today.
[00:07:56.673 --> 00:07:58.273]  So we're going to pray a simple prayer.
[00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:02.875]  You here, you in your homes, I want you to close your eyes, raise your right hand to heaven.
[00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:05.956]  That's where your help comes from and pray this together with me right now.
[00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:12.678]  Say, Father, I come to you in the precious name of your son Jesus.
[00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:32.941]  Lord, you said in your word, if I confess with my mouth, Jesus is my Lord and my Savior, and I believe in my heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead, I will be saved.
[00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:41.627]  So, Father, right now, I confess Jesus is my Lord and my Savior.
[00:08:42.247 --> 00:08:43.628]  Come into my heart right now.
[00:08:44.665 --> 00:08:46.206]  Take out the stony heart.
[00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:48.367]  Put in a heart of flesh.
[00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:50.028]  Wash me.
[00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:51.328]  Change me.
[00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.629]  Cleanse me.
[00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.850]  Fill me.
[00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.270]  Use me.
[00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:57.611]  Let me never be the same again.
[00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:00.613]  From this day I will serve you.
[00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.134]  I'll go where you want me to go.
[00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:05.495]  I'll do what you want me to do.
[00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.137]  I'll say what you want me to say.
[00:09:09.277 --> 00:09:10.858]  And I'll be what you want me to be.
[00:09:11.658 --> 00:09:12.539]  Not my will.
[00:09:13.644 --> 00:09:14.624]  But yours be done.
[00:09:15.385 --> 00:09:17.086]  And I thank you for this right now.
[00:09:17.986 --> 00:09:25.189]  And by faith, in the finished work of the cross, I receive the free gift of salvation.
[00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.251]  Thank you, Lord, for saving me now.
[00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:31.252]  That's it.
[00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:34.833]  Just close your eyes and lift your hands and thank Him right now.
[00:09:35.093 --> 00:09:35.434]  That's it.
[00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:36.894]  That's it right now.
[00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:40.576]  That's it right now.
[00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:43.478]  Forgiven!
[00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:45.679]  Forgiven!
[00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:46.299]  Forgiven!
[00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:47.240]  Every one of you!
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.000]  Forgiven!
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840]  In Jesus' name!
[00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:56.883]  Pastor Eric, if you can run and they can grab copies of my book on Jesus and give it to everyone that's standing.
[00:09:56.903 --> 00:09:57.723]  I've got a book for you.
[00:09:58.023 --> 00:09:59.704]  Give to everyone standing quickly.
[00:09:59.784 --> 00:10:01.224]  Usher's help, Pastor Eric, quickly.
[00:10:01.244 --> 00:10:03.045]  I need copies of my book.
[00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:04.546]  All those that stood, stand.
[00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:06.486]  I'm gonna give you copies of my books here, quickly.
[00:10:09.187 --> 00:10:09.868]  Oh, hallelujah.
[00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:10.888]  We love you so much.
[00:10:12.401 --> 00:10:14.042]  If you're in the Tampa area, come visit us.
[00:10:14.662 --> 00:10:17.043]  But wherever you are, you've got to find a church, plug in.
[00:10:17.663 --> 00:10:23.225]  If there is no church, then you can tune in online and watch revival.com.
[00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:25.685]  It's important that you stay connected.
[00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:27.066]  You can't be a loner.
[00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:28.866]  You can't be alone.
[00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:31.207]  You know, people were alone during this whole COVID thing.
[00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:33.328]  They found their bodies six weeks later.
[00:10:33.688 --> 00:10:37.029]  Neighbors smelt the stench of dying bodies in the house next door.
[00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:38.910]  That's when they found they were just alone.
[00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.010]  Nobody knew where they were.
[00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:43.961]  People need to know where you are.
[00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:45.563]  We need to be accountable.
[00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:47.305]  Are you with me?
[00:10:48.707 --> 00:10:49.268]  Is that good?
[00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.950]  Is that good?
[00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:54.595]  How many realize that you're part of the family right now?
[00:10:56.778 --> 00:10:58.440]  How many realize you're part of the family?
[00:11:00.189 --> 00:11:05.150]  And if there's any of you that want a scholarship to River University, I'll give it to you.
[00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.031]  It's my gift to you with Clemson.
[00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.271]  You mean you give away scholarship?
[00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:10.972]  Yeah, all your tuition paid for three years, it's up to you.
[00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:15.693]  We've got a school of government, we've got a school of worship, we've got a common institute, we've got many things going on here.
[00:11:16.073 --> 00:11:17.273]  Over 500 students.
[00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:23.815]  This is actually the auditorium for the students, which was run out of room as they're packing out in here.
[00:11:24.055 --> 00:11:27.636]  But let me tell you right now, God wants to use you, and we'll train you here.
[00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:29.296]  Somebody said, well what do you get?
[00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:32.127]  If I don't pay anything, what do you get?
[00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:36.206]   I'm getting people that are fully equipped to go out and kick the devil's butt and take names.
[00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:43.907]  [Applause]
[00:11:43.907 --> 00:11:45.606]  That's what I get.
[00:11:45.692 --> 00:11:48.213]  Somebody said, how do you run a ministry if you don't make money?
[00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:54.595]  I mean, we receive offerings, but let me tell you, how many want to know how we operate this thing?
[00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:56.596]  Because we pay cash for everything.
[00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:58.517]  I mean, everything's paid for here.
[00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:00.805]  90 acres, everything's paid.
[00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:01.325]  We don't owe $1.
[00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:02.846]  We don't owe $1.
[00:12:03.887 --> 00:12:07.930]  Who wants to know how we do this?
[00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.930]  I'm going to give you a key.
[00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.191]  Who wants to know how we do this?
[00:12:11.912 --> 00:12:12.472]  We pray.
[00:12:14.093 --> 00:12:23.772]  A novel idea, but it's amazing how it works.
[00:12:23.772 --> 00:12:26.093]  The full Gospels are in the end of that book as well.
[00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:27.342]  It's all about Jesus.
[00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:30.141]  500 page book, all about Jesus.
[00:12:32.222 --> 00:12:34.963]  In actual fact, why don't I give everybody here a copy of my books?
[00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:40.164]  I'll give you 22 of my books right now, quickly.
[00:12:40.564 --> 00:12:43.825]  Put the barcode up and you can snap it with your camera.
[00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:45.965]  Put the code up, quickly.
[00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:48.666]  This is even for you watching by television, quickly.
[00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:49.526]  Put it up.
[00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:51.866]  Code.
[00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:54.547]  Put it on the screen.
[00:12:58.717 --> 00:12:59.618]  You have to be ready, guys.
[00:12:59.658 --> 00:13:03.160]  You have to be ready.
[00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:05.281]  Code.
[00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:08.363]  It's up.
[00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.264]  They will scan me.
[00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:12.266]  22 of my books there for free.
[00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:13.406]  Download it on your phone.
[00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:15.688]  Take a picture and do it later.
[00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.729]  If you don't know how to do it, ask a four-year-old.
[00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:20.808]  they'll connect it for you.
[00:13:20.808 --> 00:13:37.287]  And you can download it later.
[00:13:35.575 --> 00:13:36.936]  It'll be a great blessing to you.
[00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.797]  But promise me one thing, read it.
[00:13:39.977 --> 00:13:40.317]  What's this?
[00:13:40.918 --> 00:13:41.438]  Prayer requests.
[00:13:41.458 --> 00:13:52.223]  Look at the people calling in Oak Ridge, Oak Park, Illinois, Miami, Florida, Wheaton, Illinois, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Boston, Massachusetts, Southern Miss... wherever.
[00:13:53.224 --> 00:13:54.284]  Northport, Florida.
[00:13:54.324 --> 00:13:55.625]  You know where that is, Northport.
[00:13:56.753 --> 00:14:04.441]  Help me, I go to Pastor Tom Lightley's church.
[00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:05.902]  Sorry, I had to read that.
[00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:09.446]  Sorry, I didn't mean that.
[00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:11.548]  They were calling for prayer.
[00:14:11.607 --> 00:14:18.607]  Help me, help me, I gotta pass the top shirt.
[00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:20.607]  (laughter)
[00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:22.607]  Why am I here? Bless you.
[00:14:23.172 --> 00:14:25.533]  Look at the people that just made Right With God here tonight.
[00:14:25.593 --> 00:14:26.294]  Isn't that awesome?
[00:14:26.314 --> 00:14:27.854]  Isn't that awesome?
[00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:32.216]  Now, all right, now let's do this.
[00:14:32.256 --> 00:14:36.918]  What we're going to do, I'm going to quickly give you an opportunity to sow towards what we're doing.
[00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.458]  You do whatever God tells you to do.
[00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:43.280]  And then while we're doing that, they're going to sing and they'll get everything ready here for Alex and me.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:49.183]  And right after that, I'll say goodbye to YouTube and Facebook because he's so controversial, they'll ban me.
[00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:52.744]  No, I keep that for the gospel.
[00:14:52.804 --> 00:14:53.965]  I keep YouTube and Facebook.
[00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:56.268]  But on all the other platforms, we're up.
[00:14:56.368 --> 00:15:02.074]  So, if you're watching on television, you can already start going to revivaltv.com or go to infowars.com.
[00:15:02.394 --> 00:15:07.800]  And by the way, let me just say, if you're watching on InfoWars, support Alex Jones.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.021]  Buy his product.
[00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.015]  Get his nutraceuticals.
[00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:16.796]  Get whatever he has.
[00:15:16.976 --> 00:15:18.136]  Buy the films.
[00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:19.317]  Get the t-shirt.
[00:15:19.357 --> 00:15:20.698]  Get whatever he has.
[00:15:20.758 --> 00:15:23.639]  Helps him in the fight against these bastards.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.260]  Amen.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.841]  Well, sorry.
[00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:28.882]  I didn't mean to insult bastards.
[00:15:28.942 --> 00:15:29.682]  So, so bad.
[00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:30.562]  I feel bad.
[00:15:30.622 --> 00:15:32.063]  I just insulted bastards.
[00:15:32.603 --> 00:15:33.284]  I'm so sorry.
[00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:34.024]  Please forgive me.
[00:15:34.324 --> 00:15:35.625]  All the bastards out there.
[00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:41.708]  Somebody said we just cussed.
[00:15:41.788 --> 00:15:42.189]  I didn't.
[00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:43.030]  It's in the Bible.
[00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.472]  The Bible says the book of Hebrews.
[00:15:45.433 --> 00:15:47.395]  If you're not submitted to God, you're a bastard.
[00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:48.196]  That's what it said.
[00:15:48.397 --> 00:15:49.798]  Go read it in the King James.
[00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:51.360]  I'm not making anything up.
[00:15:52.001 --> 00:15:52.502]  Are you with me?
[00:15:53.988 --> 00:16:03.072]  Okay, so, I'm going to ask the ushers, if you come, just hand out the offering envelope, do what the Lord says, do pastor Eric, if you come, give the instruction, and then get ready to sow.
[00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:05.033]  You can give online, give by way of television.
[00:16:05.393 --> 00:16:10.696]  Sow in here, everything we're doing, we're paying cash, and we're making sure that we're blessing the body of Christ.
[00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:19.460]  I'll just tell you this, in the past three years, we've been able to sow 23 million dollars to help people around the world, from this ministry.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.102]  23 million dollars, around the world, we've been able to help people.
[00:16:23.702 --> 00:16:29.851]  So you're not giving it to cement, you're giving it to good soil, and God will bless you and reward you.
[00:16:29.951 --> 00:16:30.272]  Amen?
[00:16:31.173 --> 00:16:31.654]  Pastor Eric?
[00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.810]  Just tell them what to do, those that are watching.
[00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:35.891]  Hallelujah.

[00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:18.218]  Just let me say this to you.
[00:18:18.538 --> 00:18:21.922]  When I got arrested, everything blew up in a good way.
[00:18:24.275 --> 00:18:29.597]  So a lot of ministers felt if they didn't close or shut down, it would be the end of their ministry.
[00:18:29.637 --> 00:18:32.778]  And in actual fact, when they closed and shut down, it was the end of their ministry.
[00:18:34.139 --> 00:18:42.662]  And because we wouldn't bow, we didn't burn, and everything exploded to where I've only missed three Sundays in over three and a half years.
[00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:47.324]  And the only reason I missed them was I had to go to Africa to preach.
[00:18:47.444 --> 00:18:49.084]  I've not missed a Sunday here.
[00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:52.986]  And it's been my joy to see what the Lord's doing.
[00:18:55.407 --> 00:18:55.647]  Yeah.
[00:18:57.747 --> 00:19:02.488]  In a few weeks, we have 4,800 young people coming on the property.
[00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.549]  That's before the big camp meeting.
[00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:06.169]  They're coming from everywhere.
[00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:13.751]  Kids, teenagers, and many thousands that have come here over the course of the last three years and been in touch by God.
[00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:15.851]  Churches all over that have come alive.
[00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:23.825]   And that God's using the great work he's doing in Claremont, the great work he's doing In North Port, Florida.
[00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:24.605]  Point.
[00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:25.406]  Port.
[00:19:25.606 --> 00:19:25.946]  Point.
[00:19:26.746 --> 00:19:27.106]  Port.
[00:19:29.366 --> 00:19:32.107]  I thought maybe the hurricane made it from a port to a point.
[00:19:32.487 --> 00:19:32.987]  I don't know.
[00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:34.547]  It pointed it.
[00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:35.107]  Yeah.
[00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:37.688]  Your wife still holds it against me, doesn't she?
[00:19:38.448 --> 00:19:39.008]  It's terrible.
[00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:40.808]  You need to ask for forgiveness.
[00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.269]  You need to.
[00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:45.169]  You're a very vindictive lady.
[00:19:47.809 --> 00:19:48.530]  I know you love me.
[00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.350]  I know.
[00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.690]  She loves me, but she hates me.
[00:19:51.508 --> 00:19:52.729]  Please take care of your wife.
[00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:53.069]  Okay.
[00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:54.791]  These are people.
[00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:55.611]  These are pastors.
[00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:56.312]  Can you believe that?
[00:19:56.812 --> 00:20:01.236]  All right.
[00:20:01.296 --> 00:20:02.877]  Everybody ready to give us hallelujah?
[00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:10.087]  Okay, ushers go ahead and receive the offering, and we'll sing the song, and then we'll get ready to say goodbye.
[00:20:10.187 --> 00:20:12.349]  I will announce it when we go off YouTube and Facebook.
[00:20:12.389 --> 00:20:14.151]  Please make sure it's only those two places.
[00:20:14.712 --> 00:20:19.296]  Riverchurch Facebook, Rodney O'Donoghue, Howard Brown Facebook, and Rodney Howard Brown YouTube.
[00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:20.537]  Those are what we're going to cut.
[00:20:21.098 --> 00:20:23.080]  And we're on all the other satellites and everything.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.560]  Go for it.

[00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:27.451]  If somebody can give me the thumbs up when we're clear.
[00:25:28.812 --> 00:25:30.914]  If you don't mind, that'd be great.
[00:25:33.076 --> 00:25:34.418]  I'm a great floor manager.
[00:25:34.678 --> 00:25:36.600]  We can stay on YouTube, we just say Fashion's Great.
[00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:38.330]  Fauci's wonderful.
[00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.350]  Bill Gates is wonderful.
[00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.671]  Take hundreds of shots.

[00:25:45.574 --> 00:25:47.876]  And Michelle is beautiful.
[00:25:47.936 --> 00:25:51.718]  Michelle Obama is not Big Mike.
[00:25:51.538 --> 00:25:58.538]   Why don't you put your hands together and welcome the one and only, Alex Jones!
[00:25:58.538 --> 00:26:08.337]  You guys are awesome.
[00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:10.838]  What a great church, what a great crowd.
[00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:14.441]  Let me tell ya, I don't think the devil worshipers like this very much.
[00:26:15.001 --> 00:26:17.001]  Target's pretty upset right now.
[00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:24.921]  Target's now officially endorsed Satan.
[00:26:24.811 --> 00:26:27.293]  It says they're gonna chop Christian's heads off with their t-shirts.
[00:26:27.973 --> 00:26:28.794]  But the devil's not real.
[00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:38.161]  What we want to do tonight, I'm sure there's people that have many, many questions, and you can ask anything.
[00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:46.205]  I will just tell you, if you do go to the toilet, tell the ushers you go to the toilet, because if you go and don't come back, your seat will be gone.
[00:26:47.637 --> 00:26:48.938]  With somebody else coming in here.
[00:26:48.998 --> 00:26:49.338]  Okay.
[00:26:49.819 --> 00:26:52.060]  Can I need two roving microphones, please?
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.282]  One on this side, and one on that side.
[00:26:54.362 --> 00:26:54.602]  Okay.
[00:26:54.962 --> 00:26:59.065]  If you have a question that you want to ask Alex, if you just come stand.
[00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:01.707]  No, come out of your seat, so we know who you are.
[00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:05.349]  If we need to throw you out, it's easier to get to you.
[00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.270]  I'm just teasing.
[00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:07.971]  I'm just teasing.
[00:27:08.751 --> 00:27:12.874]  So... Just come stand in the aisles.
[00:27:12.693 --> 00:27:23.292]  I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight.
[00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.711]  Come on.
[00:27:24.651 --> 00:27:25.631]  Hello, Alex.
[00:27:25.791 --> 00:27:26.911]  Hello?
[00:27:26.931 --> 00:27:27.712]  Can you guys hear me?
[00:27:27.732 --> 00:27:28.312]  I can hear you, sir.
[00:27:28.332 --> 00:27:28.712]  Go ahead.
[00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.272]  I hear you a little bit.
[00:27:30.292 --> 00:27:30.512]  Okay.
[00:27:30.973 --> 00:27:32.693]  Guys, microphones, please.
[00:27:33.773 --> 00:27:34.513]  Just yell at me.
[00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:35.054]  Okay.
[00:27:35.874 --> 00:27:36.434]  Hello, Alex!
[00:27:36.874 --> 00:27:37.854]  Hey, brother!
[00:27:38.635 --> 00:27:43.596]  Hey, my question is, just kind of going into the rush to the border.
[00:27:45.674 --> 00:27:53.500]  I think what that is, in my opinion, and I don't know if you agree with this or not, but I think that's a credit application with the central bank.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:02.827]  Because as I understand it, the interest on the debt is serviced by income tax.
[00:28:03.527 --> 00:28:14.175]   So when you go to raise the debt ceiling, because I don't know if I noticed this, but every time they try to raise the debt ceiling, boom, there's a border rush, or there's an illegal Rush of immigration.
[00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:22.857]  And what I'm thinking is the central bank looks to the government and says, well, you don't have enough taxpayers, so you need to up the population of taxpayers.
[00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:25.057]  Well, that's 100% a big factor.
[00:28:25.077 --> 00:28:27.298]  I mean, the system always makes it financial.
[00:28:27.978 --> 00:28:33.779]  And so because we kill our children here in America, we have a negative population growth without bringing immigrants in.
[00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:38.380]  And the immigrants are fine, except they've been brought in because they collapsed the third world.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.780]  With three years of lockdown.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.741]  There's only a year here, it's been almost three years there.
[00:28:42.161 --> 00:28:48.224]  And they've done Gallup polls, 95% say it's because they, literally the factories, the farms, the ranches are shut, they're starving enough.
[00:28:48.584 --> 00:28:53.946]  So they're pretty much refugees and are victims of the UN that collapsed their countries and they bring them here.
[00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:58.808]  But it's admitted at the IMF and World Bank that they're bringing people in for replacement migration.
[00:28:58.827 --> 00:29:06.347]   that's official UN plan, year 2000, to bring in replacement groups for the first world.
[00:29:06.347 --> 00:29:09.747]   But again, it'd be great to bring folks in as long as we teach about America and freedom,
[00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:12.627]  and instead of being brought in as a permanent underclass.
[00:29:12.627 --> 00:29:15.827]   What you're saying is not just your opinion observing it, you're totally right, sir.
[00:29:15.827 --> 00:29:20.788]   It is actually built into the IMF World Bank actuaries to do that.
[00:29:20.788 --> 00:29:24.307]   But you have to ask yourself why they want to kill the first world having children and
[00:29:24.307 --> 00:29:27.387]   then bring in the third world, because they've already enslaved them in programming, they
[00:29:28.328 --> 00:29:34.271]  But I see, despite this, God rising up and awakening the people that have been brought here and impoverished.
[00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:36.072]  And in many ways, it's backfiring on them.
[00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:37.393]  That's why they're so enraged.
[00:29:39.134 --> 00:29:43.996]  Hi, Alex.
[00:29:44.717 --> 00:29:49.079]  I'm actually the caller that calls in your program way too much.
[00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:50.159]  Judy in Florida.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:50.900]  Oh, hey, Judy!
[00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:54.522]  You don't call in way too much, but I recognize your voice.
[00:29:55.122 --> 00:29:56.482]  Well, thank you.
[00:29:57.042 --> 00:30:00.684]  I just wanted to, because I get long-winded, so I just want to ask.
[00:30:01.124 --> 00:30:04.585]  I'd love to snap a picture with you and just shake your hand afterwards.
[00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:05.765]  Well, it's a joke right now.
[00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:06.165]  Get up here.
[00:30:06.185 --> 00:30:12.487]  Can't do this with everybody until the end, though.
[00:30:12.507 --> 00:30:13.167]  I love you all day.
[00:30:13.187 --> 00:30:17.929]  She wants a picture with a walrus.
[00:30:17.969 --> 00:30:18.409]  She gets one.
[00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.190]  Walrus Jr.
[00:30:21.616 --> 00:30:41.616]  (Applause)
[00:30:41.616 --> 00:30:42.616]  All right, next.
[00:30:42.616 --> 00:30:43.616]  Hi, Alex.
[00:30:43.616 --> 00:30:48.616]   I would like you to speak to what the plan is for people serving in the military.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.161]  I have a son serving in the Marine Corps.
[00:30:51.201 --> 00:30:51.921]  He's a sergeant.
[00:30:51.961 --> 00:30:54.723]  He's been 10 years and I'm concerned for him.
[00:30:55.965 --> 00:31:01.706]  Absolutely, I'm really concerned for our military, because that's so important to our history and our culture, and they're some of the best people.
[00:31:02.207 --> 00:31:04.207]  But then our military is captured from the top.
[00:31:04.787 --> 00:31:18.911]  And so the globalists want our military for the power as, while they transfer things to the robot AI system, so the future's not human, according to the UN, and Klaus Schwab, and no, Harari and the rest of them.
[00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:20.651]  You all know Harari.
[00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:33.631]   And so they're using our military as guinea pigs, They're attacking our military, and it's just disgusting with the critical race theory and the transgenderism and things they're doing as a litmus test to drive out the good people.
[00:31:34.032 --> 00:31:34.712]  So it's a paradox.
[00:31:34.732 --> 00:31:38.515]  You want good men and women to stay in the military, but you also want them protected from what's happening.
[00:31:38.915 --> 00:31:39.956]  So the globalists win either way.
[00:31:40.036 --> 00:31:46.520]  The good people stay in, they can poison them, and then their minions come in, they can, you know, you basically rise them up to positions of power.
[00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:49.921]   But everybody needs to understand, people think our military is like this secret hope
[00:31:49.921 --> 00:31:53.040]  and like the Q people say, "Oh, it's all really all handled."
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.799]   The truth is our military for 40 years at the top, at the one star up general level,
[00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:03.480]   are almost all compromised and controlled and globalists that were put there.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.319]  And so there's been a coup over our military at the top.
[00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:07.839]  And so it's really paradoxical.
[00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:08.839]  God has to sort that out.
[00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:11.640]  But only God's going to fix this and God working through us.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.040]   It's not going to be some magic president, though I think Trump's a good person.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.520]  It's not going to be somebody, some military group.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]  It's going to be us.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]  Make no mistake.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.039]   It's going to be the churches and the people standing up like this church did and being
[00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:27.601]  an example to others and leadership.
[00:32:27.601 --> 00:32:29.720]  And so your son will have to make that decision for himself.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.039]  But yes.
[00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:31.937]  Martial law incoming.
[00:32:31.977 --> 00:32:32.318]  It's here.
[00:32:32.378 --> 00:32:35.621]  America is under globalist occupation at the top.
[00:32:36.042 --> 00:32:37.924]  They're trying to extend it down to lower levels.
[00:32:37.944 --> 00:32:39.065]  They're trying to cause a race war.
[00:32:39.426 --> 00:32:44.071]  But I'm telling you, all the real numbers and demographics show it's causing more unity than ever.
[00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:51.130]  The people are waking up and coming together.
[00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.130]  Thank you.
[00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.130]  Thank you.
[00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.130]  Thank you.
[00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:55.130]  Thank you.
[00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.130]  Thank you.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.562]  But for me, this pandemic took the wind out of my sails.
[00:33:01.642 --> 00:33:02.682]  My church fell apart.
[00:33:03.342 --> 00:33:07.683]  No pastors were talking about being strong and God and His power.
[00:33:07.703 --> 00:33:10.004]  They were all talking about masks and social distancing.
[00:33:10.044 --> 00:33:13.125]  So both of you have given me tremendous hope.
[00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:14.906]  And I hope everyone agrees with me on that.
[00:33:14.946 --> 00:33:15.146]  Thank you.
[00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:16.766]  Well, everybody can fear God, absolutely.
[00:33:16.826 --> 00:33:17.546]  And that's the thing.
[00:33:18.367 --> 00:33:19.107]  I'm afraid of God.
[00:33:20.305 --> 00:33:21.045]  Well, exactly.
[00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:33.711]  That's the thing you were saying when I met you today, and Pastor Brown was saying, is that we cannot be afraid of the system and afraid of what it's going to say and do, because submitting to it destroys us.
[00:33:33.731 --> 00:33:39.174]  And what he said is true, not as in his words when he's seen as a pastor that knows thousands of ministers and people around the world.
[00:33:40.313 --> 00:33:42.954]  The churches that shut down, almost none of them came back.
[00:33:43.234 --> 00:33:43.975]  The enemy knew that.
[00:33:44.295 --> 00:33:49.297]  That shows why are they, the topless bars and the liquor stores and the big box stores never closed.
[00:33:49.738 --> 00:33:54.100]  But churches had to close all over the world because the system's scared of what's happening in here.
[00:33:55.086 --> 00:33:56.308]  And think about that.
[00:33:56.728 --> 00:34:00.092]  The people that shut down believing they would come back stronger are gone.
[00:34:00.413 --> 00:34:05.139]  The people that didn't back down, whether it was businesses or churches, you name it, only got bigger.
[00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:06.701]  And that's what it's about.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:13.880]   When the darkness comes in, the light that's left is going to be that much stronger.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:20.880]   So my question is with the border crisis, it seems to me they're bringing in military age males,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   they're placing them all over the country, they're giving them money and phones.
[00:34:24.221 --> 00:34:30.510]  I personally think the whole defund the police is so they can bring in a UN police force, and they're going to use these immigrants to do it.
[00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:32.709]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:35.991]  I mean, mainly they're bringing them in for sex trafficking and slave labor.
[00:34:36.311 --> 00:34:46.316]  The Democratic Party places these women and children, mainly, and young men in operations and sweatshops all over the country, takes most of their paycheck, and signs them up for welfare under fake aliases.
[00:34:46.836 --> 00:34:49.097]  And so 90% are being exploited.
[00:34:49.437 --> 00:35:02.343]   But yes, there is a larger plan with military-age men who are leftist indoctrinated in UN camps before they get here, whether it's outside Europe or here, to then, when they get messages or told, like Antifa to go burn stuff down.
[00:35:02.603 --> 00:35:05.124]  So they are getting a certain cadre out of that.
[00:35:05.924 --> 00:35:10.866]  But, you know, I mean, the larger spectrum of things, we should control the border.
[00:35:10.886 --> 00:35:12.007]  It's a national security issue.
[00:35:12.327 --> 00:35:15.928]  But at the end of the day, what the devil means to hurt us, God turns around.
[00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:20.810]  And I have seen that if you actually reach out to those people, they're some of the most open to the truth.
[00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:22.571]  And we can recruit them.
[00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:27.313]  Doesn't mean we don't control the border, but we need to reach out to all these immigrants, people brought here to be exploited.
[00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:28.734]  We need to get them over with God.
[00:35:28.554 --> 00:35:38.673]  they're hungry. By Jim Caviezel.
[00:35:36.764 --> 00:35:41.486]  If you guys haven't bought tickets for the July 4th seeing of Sound of Freedom, please do it for the people.
[00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:43.647]  Even if you don't go, buy the tickets.
[00:35:44.188 --> 00:35:46.089]  It's a brilliant piece of art.
[00:35:46.189 --> 00:35:52.132]  It's also horrific, but we all need to support making people aware of the horrific crime.
[00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.572]  I mean, like, evil to me.
[00:35:53.592 --> 00:35:56.094]  I mean, not like, you know, getting shot.
[00:35:56.134 --> 00:35:57.294]  That's what evil to me was.
[00:35:57.394 --> 00:35:58.715]  Now, like adrenochrome.
[00:35:59.015 --> 00:35:59.896]  It's insane.
[00:35:59.916 --> 00:36:00.676]  It's so evil.
[00:36:01.216 --> 00:36:03.677]  It's heartbreaking, and everyone needs to get behind it.
[00:36:03.697 --> 00:36:04.057]  Well, that's right.
[00:36:04.137 --> 00:36:06.318]  Anything you can imagine, it's ten times worse.
[00:36:06.918 --> 00:36:08.618]  Anything you can imagine they're doing.
[00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:10.559]  It's widespread.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:12.680]  Yes.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:14.420]  Hi.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.741]  Oh, it's so good to be here.
[00:36:15.761 --> 00:36:19.782]  Oh my God, I can't believe I'm finally at Rahi's church, and I'm near Alex.
[00:36:20.002 --> 00:36:22.083]  Alex, I've been listening to you for ages.
[00:36:22.123 --> 00:36:22.503]  Thank you.
[00:36:22.523 --> 00:36:25.484]  I stumbled across you in England, you and Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:36:25.504 --> 00:36:25.864]  Oh yeah.
[00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:27.445]  I knew you were right.
[00:36:27.465 --> 00:36:28.565]  I didn't want you to be.
[00:36:30.014 --> 00:36:31.759]  Are you from England?
[00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:32.060]  I'm a 50 50.
[00:36:32.702 --> 00:36:34.206]  I'm a half and half.
[00:36:37.975 --> 00:36:40.216]  I'm American, but I'm a resident there, too.
[00:36:40.236 --> 00:36:40.676]  I understand.
[00:36:40.716 --> 00:36:41.576]  My son's a limey.
[00:36:41.997 --> 00:36:43.897]  Awesome.
[00:36:43.977 --> 00:36:46.158]  But no, that's where I came across you, was over there.
[00:36:46.218 --> 00:36:52.180]  They're very awake to you over there, but they can't, you know, they can't be seen to be going against the system.
[00:36:52.541 --> 00:36:54.541]  They have to... Oh, they arrest you for your speech over there.
[00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:55.482]  Oh, yeah, no, I know.
[00:36:55.542 --> 00:36:56.402]  We were just there.
[00:36:56.442 --> 00:37:05.726]  We made a point of talking to everybody, and as soon as we were like, no, give us the menu, and no, we don't do that, the people there smiled.
[00:37:05.746 --> 00:37:06.486]  They were awake.
[00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:10.208]  But they couldn't be seen to be going against the grain.
[00:37:10.248 --> 00:37:12.690]  They don't have arms in our Constitution.
[00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:13.891]  But they're awake.
[00:37:14.651 --> 00:37:16.032]  Anyway, sorry.
[00:37:16.052 --> 00:37:18.354]  No, it's a great point.
[00:37:18.814 --> 00:37:25.059]  I have just had this burning thing on me for a long time and during this whole thing.
[00:37:27.083 --> 00:37:39.344]  I don't understand why I'm concerned about this coming election because everybody is like chomping at the bit so hard to want to smack the left down and I completely understand that.
[00:37:41.682 --> 00:37:53.306]  Um, we could be blindsided by it because I, I love President Trump, but he did say he wanted to reunite church and state and I'm just spooked beyond belief about that.
[00:37:53.366 --> 00:37:54.586]  I don't understand that.
[00:37:55.066 --> 00:37:55.907]  I'm bothered by it.
[00:37:55.987 --> 00:37:59.168]  I'm not taking the mark of the beast and no one is killing me.
[00:37:59.468 --> 00:37:59.848]  Okay.
[00:38:00.328 --> 00:38:05.269]  So I have, I'm having like apocalypse horrors over that.
[00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.310]  I don't understand it.
[00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:11.332]   In fairness to Trump, he's very smart in ways, but he also, Never ran for office.
[00:38:11.352 --> 00:38:12.432]  Won the first time he did.
[00:38:13.093 --> 00:38:15.354]  And everybody says he's 3D chess and all this stuff.
[00:38:15.754 --> 00:38:18.635]  Maybe like an idiot savant, but he gets a lot of stuff wrong.
[00:38:19.316 --> 00:38:21.857]  So believe me, Trump's not going to unify church and state.
[00:38:22.677 --> 00:38:24.839]  I hope not, because that's terrifying.
[00:38:24.879 --> 00:38:27.540]  All you gotta know is look how the globalists are after Trump.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.241]  Because he's got problems.
[00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:30.081]  He does things I don't like.
[00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.162]  But let me tell you, they're not telling him what to do.
[00:38:32.723 --> 00:38:33.483]  So that's why I don't like him.
[00:38:34.542 --> 00:38:35.843]  I like that a lot.
[00:38:36.123 --> 00:38:37.603]  I think Trump overall is good.
[00:38:37.703 --> 00:38:39.784]  You know why that's scary though, right?
[00:38:40.225 --> 00:38:40.645]  Absolutely.
[00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:42.165]  Well, I don't believe in a state run religion.
[00:38:43.206 --> 00:38:44.767]  And I don't think Trump's going to give us one.
[00:38:44.807 --> 00:38:45.747]  We would be England.
[00:38:45.787 --> 00:38:48.328]  We wouldn't be America if we were church and state.
[00:38:48.448 --> 00:38:50.069]  And then they could be tyrannical to us.
[00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:51.790]  Well, we already have a state run religion.
[00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.250]  That's the LGBTPS.
[00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.971]  That's right.
[00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:54.791]  That's right.
[00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:57.211]  It's now the S for Satan.
[00:38:57.211 --> 00:39:04.211]  I like that t-shirt.
[00:39:03.648 --> 00:39:05.470]  That's a vintage Space Force shirt.
[00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:05.751]  Thank you.
[00:39:06.592 --> 00:39:07.793]  Space Force, you'll love it.
[00:39:08.695 --> 00:39:09.576]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:39:09.996 --> 00:39:13.080]  I'm from Northport, the town you guys have been making fun of all night.
[00:39:15.034 --> 00:39:16.374]  I just wanted to say something.
[00:39:17.535 --> 00:39:27.057]  You touch a lot about globalists and the ESG funding that we are supporting these companies that are perpetuating these ESGs.
[00:39:28.037 --> 00:39:34.859]  And recently you've been talking about boycotts, and I think that's really important, and I think you need to explain more about what a boycott is.
[00:39:35.279 --> 00:39:42.441]   Defunding these globalists, like the targets, the Anheuser-Busch's, We need to expand that.
[00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:47.283]  Not just go against satanic companies, but support pro-God companies.
[00:39:47.943 --> 00:39:51.525]  And I think through that, I think we can... Absolutely!
[00:39:51.345 --> 00:40:03.425]   Absolutely, I mean, about 15 years ago, the Western Journalism Center sued and got the
[00:40:03.425 --> 00:40:09.505]   Clinton documents out of their presidential library there in Little Rock.
[00:40:10.143 --> 00:40:24.834]  And the first thing they wanted when they got in the White House, they were all CIA, and it's in there, is, we've got to stop Christians, populists, conservatives, or anybody that doesn't want to go under our control from having their own companies, their own economy, their own media, their own culture, because America is really populist and Christian and pro-freedom.
[00:40:24.854 --> 00:40:25.514]  It actually says this.
[00:40:26.014 --> 00:40:26.895]  World.net earlier wrote about it.
[00:40:27.255 --> 00:40:28.576]  And they said, we've got to stop them.
[00:40:29.017 --> 00:40:34.801]  And so, yeah, it's great to not buy from Anheuser-Busch, and it's great not to buy from Target, who goes there anyways.
[00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:36.082]  I mean, literally, it's like...
[00:40:36.762 --> 00:40:38.043]  You know, just unbelievable.
[00:40:39.243 --> 00:40:41.504]  But we have to then decide where we are going to buy.
[00:40:41.824 --> 00:40:51.927]  And so the ESG and the UN is their whole plan, through the digital IDs, through the digital system that's almost here, they're announcing it everywhere, to punish you if you don't buy what they want, or only let you buy from them.
[00:40:52.307 --> 00:40:56.449]  So, oh, here's your free food credits, $2,000 this month, but you can only buy it from us, and guess what?
[00:40:56.509 --> 00:40:57.269]  It's bug protein.
[00:40:58.484 --> 00:41:01.087]  So that's why they say, oh, you will eat the bugs, because it's all that's going to be available.
[00:41:01.487 --> 00:41:04.290]  I mean, they're banning half the farms in the next five years than the other ones.
[00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.130]  They're just taking them.
[00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:06.071]  The army goes in.
[00:41:06.752 --> 00:41:10.596]  I mean, this is... Ireland just announced they're going to ban the cows and sheep.
[00:41:11.196 --> 00:41:12.237]  Because it's bad for the earth.
[00:41:12.498 --> 00:41:13.398]  Well, you're bad for the earth.
[00:41:13.418 --> 00:41:13.879]  You're carbon.
[00:41:13.939 --> 00:41:14.900]  No, they're good for the earth.
[00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:20.032]  So it's the most satanic agenda ever, and the ESGs must be defeated.
[00:41:20.092 --> 00:41:23.953]  But we know they're going to get it for a while, and then it's, I mean, it's all happening.
[00:41:24.033 --> 00:41:26.174]  So, but in the end, Satan's going to fall.
[00:41:26.554 --> 00:41:29.936]  And so all these people want to comply, get their ESG, bow down.
[00:41:30.316 --> 00:41:35.378]  Oh, you're not going to cut your children's genitals off to get ESG money after this comes to place.
[00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:42.968]  They're talking about how you'll sign up, I've got carbon credits, I can go party and go to Hawaii for a year and be euthanized by the government.
[00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:44.589]  I sign on to it, bro, they make you do it.
[00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.650]  Or I can live ten years and eat bugs.
[00:41:47.131 --> 00:41:48.872]  People are going to opt in to suicide.
[00:41:49.172 --> 00:41:50.773]  It's going to be promoted like transgenderism.
[00:41:50.953 --> 00:41:54.815]  You think they're cutting women's breasts off and seven-year-old boys' genitals off?
[00:41:54.835 --> 00:41:55.876]  You think that's crazy?
[00:41:56.276 --> 00:42:01.880]  Canada's already pushing government-forced suicide on children that are wards of the state.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.502]  And mentally ill people with the government's in control says, well, we decide they die.
[00:42:06.002 --> 00:42:10.526]  So if you think it's bad to cut children's genitals off, they are going to celebrate.
[00:42:10.546 --> 00:42:12.288]  They already have ads in Canada, produced by the government.
[00:42:12.468 --> 00:42:13.569]  This woman's wonderful.
[00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:16.912]  She was depressed and she killed herself and it was good for the earth.
[00:42:17.312 --> 00:42:20.055]  And what, you're against their choice to kill themselves?
[00:42:21.056 --> 00:42:22.317]  So you won't, they'll tell you.
[00:42:23.112 --> 00:42:28.113]  You can get credits for your family for two years when they collapse everything, but you've got to euthanize yourself.
[00:42:28.353 --> 00:42:28.953]  Sign right here.
[00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:30.533]  And they'll be like, look at this hero.
[00:42:30.813 --> 00:42:32.114]  He was euthanized.
[00:42:32.294 --> 00:42:39.335]  And they give them this great drug where you feel great, and you watch a movie while you die, and they literally grind you up and use it for fertilizer on food.
[00:42:40.055 --> 00:42:43.796]  23 states have passed human compost to grow the food.
[00:42:44.016 --> 00:42:45.176]  The whole plant's ready!
[00:42:45.416 --> 00:42:46.816]  The bug factories are ready!
[00:42:46.836 --> 00:42:47.777]  Okay?
[00:42:47.877 --> 00:42:48.477]  They're coming!
[00:42:48.637 --> 00:42:49.097]  They're here!
[00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:52.906]  Soon, nobody will be able to deny it.
[00:42:53.526 --> 00:42:55.787]  They will kill you if they can.
[00:42:55.987 --> 00:42:57.168]  But they can't kill your soul.
[00:42:57.188 --> 00:43:03.491]  Now that's a light answer, but that's what's going down.
[00:43:04.151 --> 00:43:04.511]  Go ahead.
[00:43:04.531 --> 00:43:06.792]  Hello, yes.
[00:43:06.992 --> 00:43:07.893]  My name is Holly.
[00:43:08.453 --> 00:43:11.914]  I consider myself to be a Canadian medical refugee at this point.
[00:43:12.334 --> 00:43:15.636]  Three years ago, I was in chronic pain at that point for three years.
[00:43:16.448 --> 00:43:21.892]  And I had the opportunity to come down here and the freedom of choice of doctors down here in the private health care system saved my life.
[00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:23.454]  I'm not even kidding.
[00:43:24.747 --> 00:43:25.827]  Trust me, you want choice.
[00:43:26.508 --> 00:43:33.931]  This evening, though, Alex, I want to speak to you in regards to your relationship and your story about the X-Files and Chris Carter.
[00:43:34.351 --> 00:43:34.551]  Yes.
[00:43:34.711 --> 00:43:40.053]  I'm, in fact, the creator of TheXFilesNews.com, and I've called your show several times.
[00:43:40.113 --> 00:43:40.794]  I've spoken with you.
[00:43:42.054 --> 00:44:00.411]   In 2015, while I was still working on site, a few of my editors and reporters that were stateside, because I was in Canada at the time, They attended New York Comic Con, and the goal was to go there and report back on the spoilers, the video clips that they were shown for the future episodes.
[00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:06.513]  And I realized about halfway through that my reporters were at that convention and they weren't working.
[00:44:06.713 --> 00:44:07.734]  They weren't doing their job.
[00:44:08.194 --> 00:44:10.375]  So other sites were reporting the news.
[00:44:10.415 --> 00:44:16.377]  So I went to, I collected the information from the other sites that were out there, and I decided to update my own website myself.
[00:44:17.057 --> 00:44:27.552]  At that point there, the editor-in-chief, who was a refugee from Venezuela that I helped bring to America, her work through me and my website brought her here.
[00:44:29.034 --> 00:44:30.716]  She must have been following their orders.
[00:44:30.896 --> 00:44:33.340]  I'm going to say Frank Spottnitz, the editor-producer.
[00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:37.022]  But they removed me from my own website.
[00:44:37.222 --> 00:44:38.663]  They blocked me from my own website.
[00:44:38.983 --> 00:44:40.343]  They stole my own website.
[00:44:40.363 --> 00:44:41.104]  This was October 2015.
[00:44:42.324 --> 00:44:45.545]  And once that happened, it took me but two weeks to recover from the shock.
[00:44:45.745 --> 00:44:47.826]  But I knew that the censorship was coming in then.
[00:44:47.846 --> 00:44:49.587]  And this was October 2015, sir.
[00:44:50.127 --> 00:44:51.467]  And I want to point out one more thing.
[00:44:52.328 --> 00:44:55.109]  You're absolutely right about the predictive programming in DX files.
[00:44:55.689 --> 00:44:59.229]  And, um, the two seasons were supposed to air back to back.
[00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:02.289]   There were supposed to be like, it's supposed to be six, one and then two.
[00:45:02.289 --> 00:45:06.669]   But if you notice one season aired and then there were supposed to air the second
[00:45:06.669 --> 00:45:08.528]  one and then Trump got elected in.
[00:45:08.528 --> 00:45:12.129]   And at that point there, there was an announcement a few weeks later saying
[00:45:12.129 --> 00:45:16.528]   that they were going to postpone the last season and they made it wait a year.
[00:45:16.528 --> 00:45:19.248]  And at that point there, they bought it back.
[00:45:19.248 --> 00:45:22.769]   And then Scully's in the coma waking up and suddenly she's having
[00:45:22.769 --> 00:45:23.449]  her own Jr.
[00:45:23.449 --> 00:45:24.368]  Jr.
[00:45:24.368 --> 00:45:25.469]  Moment like Dallas.
[00:45:25.883 --> 00:45:40.433]   It's like she woke up and it was all a dream and it's my opinion at that point there, I don't know the inside baseball of X-Files like you do.
[00:45:40.813 --> 00:45:52.217]  Actually, I've talked to Chris Carter a few times, and I know that he said the CIA told them a year before 9-11 to make an episode about 9-11, and that they're doing predictive programming.
[00:45:52.657 --> 00:45:56.578]  And I know he said, like, the last season, the talk show host was based on me, so that's what I've told them.
[00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:58.059]  Sounds like you know a lot more about it than me.
[00:45:58.099 --> 00:45:58.719]  Very interesting.
[00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:03.886]  Sir, um, I mean, I've come this far, I never thought I'd have the opportunity to ever meet you in my life.
[00:46:04.327 --> 00:46:05.867]  I would really like to shake your hand and thank you.
[00:46:05.687 --> 00:46:07.687]  Well sure, come shake my hand!
[00:46:07.687 --> 00:46:17.687]  [Applause]
[00:46:17.687 --> 00:46:24.017]   You know, that's when I felt that this would be an encouragement to everybody and also an encouragement to
[00:46:24.017 --> 00:46:24.687]  Alex.
[00:46:24.687 --> 00:46:27.687]   Because there's more people that love him than actually hate him.
[00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:29.081]  Is this a minimum?
[00:46:29.241 --> 00:46:42.846]  I saw you had a t-shirt, Alex Jones for president.
[00:46:43.446 --> 00:46:44.766]  Those are fine.
[00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:49.748]  Alright, let's go to this white lady.
[00:46:52.129 --> 00:46:58.644]   Hi Alex, my name is Paris and I live right down the street and I want to tell you that God had me come here to see you today.
[00:46:58.664 --> 00:47:02.607]  I actually work with William K. Black, and I know you know who he is.
[00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:09.112]  I'm in a documentary called TheCon.TV, and I work as a forensic paralegal in mortgage fraud.
[00:47:09.512 --> 00:47:14.836]  And I want you to understand that some of the things that you're saying about corporate takeover is happening.
[00:47:15.317 --> 00:47:23.082]   We, our country, has given Wall Street and the banks Pretty much our entire country.
[00:47:23.703 --> 00:47:28.226]  I work with victims that are being illegally removed from their home through documentation fraud.
[00:47:28.626 --> 00:47:31.148]  I have clients that are committing suicide.
[00:47:31.688 --> 00:47:37.312]  Their sanity is slipped away, and they're fighting with everything that they have.
[00:47:37.472 --> 00:47:41.294]  And the con, when we came out with it, it was financed by Adam Brofman.
[00:47:41.715 --> 00:47:42.715]  I don't know if you know who he is.
[00:47:43.436 --> 00:47:46.078]  William K. Black, we have... I remember interviewing him.
[00:47:46.158 --> 00:47:46.618]  I've seen him.
[00:47:46.658 --> 00:47:48.658]  There's a book and a film, yeah.
[00:47:48.658 --> 00:47:51.658]   I mean, it's well known, and big banks pay these billion dollar fines.
[00:47:51.658 --> 00:47:53.658]  They'll buy your mortgage.
[00:47:53.658 --> 00:47:54.658]  This is one trick they do.
[00:47:54.658 --> 00:47:57.158]   They'll buy your mortgage and then sell it three times in a few months.
[00:47:57.158 --> 00:47:59.658]  It won't let you know the address that's in your check.
[00:47:59.658 --> 00:48:00.658]  Then they take your house.
[00:48:00.658 --> 00:48:02.658]  There's a little bit more to that.
[00:48:02.568 --> 00:48:06.510]  We were actually set up when Clinton repealed Glass-Steagall.
[00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:07.951]  It allowed the two of them to get together.
[00:48:08.371 --> 00:48:11.793]  So all of the mortgages that led up from 1990... I'm a forensic paralegal.
[00:48:11.813 --> 00:48:12.833]  This is what I do for a living.
[00:48:13.173 --> 00:48:18.536]  Everything from 1998 up to 2008 has all predatory loans and fraudulent loans.
[00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:23.599]  So while everybody's paying fines, we're getting buried in court.
[00:48:24.499 --> 00:48:31.884]  I'm watching people literally having like SWAT team kind of cops come to their house and rip them out of their house.
[00:48:31.924 --> 00:48:33.264]  Sure, and these courts know what they're doing.
[00:48:33.444 --> 00:48:42.370]  And the courts know what they're doing, but the problem is not every American knows what's really going on because let us be told, let's be seen.
[00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.252]  So I just wanted to give you my information because I live down the street.
[00:48:46.272 --> 00:48:46.552]  Sure, wonderful.
[00:48:46.572 --> 00:48:50.774]  And I really would love to talk to you, but I also wanted to meet you because I've been following you on and off for years.
[00:48:50.594 --> 00:49:03.594]  Thank you so much.
[00:49:03.634 --> 00:49:14.882]  Yes, that's the first time I've been here, but I think it's the weirdest thing, because I never go through events around the house, and I saw it and it was on, and I'm like, holy crap, I have to come!
[00:49:14.902 --> 00:49:15.282]  Good to have you!
[00:49:15.302 --> 00:49:23.949]  Well, because when you started talking about me and everything else, and I'm like, this is exactly where... God has been guiding me for a lot.
[00:49:24.029 --> 00:49:31.925]   I have a very large case in New York, and I can prove that the GSEs Have congressional authority to steal our homes.
[00:49:32.145 --> 00:49:38.226]  Can you say that we've got a constitutional attorney right here, we have a river legal, and I really want you to meet with her.
[00:49:38.486 --> 00:49:44.687]  Yeah, and that's when I'm building, I'm building a national coalition of victims because I can't get the victims to come out of the shadows.
[00:49:45.187 --> 00:49:49.288]  But I'm also dealing with people in the UK and Australia, we're all over the air.
[00:49:49.308 --> 00:49:53.329]  Look, this is, they've been, well she said they pay fines, it's all admitted they do this.
[00:49:53.909 --> 00:49:56.530]  And the banks are just robbing everybody, we have to organize against them.
[00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:57.250]  God bless you.
[00:49:59.185 --> 00:50:02.227]  Just keep your numbers so that we can stay in touch.
[00:50:02.548 --> 00:50:03.328]  There's a lot of people.
[00:50:03.348 --> 00:50:03.888]  I love you all.
[00:50:03.908 --> 00:50:05.069]  We got to move to the people here.
[00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:06.870]  We'll be here three days from now.
[00:50:07.111 --> 00:50:07.491]  It's fun.
[00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:08.311]  We're doing this.
[00:50:08.592 --> 00:50:09.212]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:50:09.372 --> 00:50:09.993]  Love the t-shirt.
[00:50:10.353 --> 00:50:10.773]  Thank you.
[00:50:11.814 --> 00:50:14.716]  Both of you were instrumental in waking me up.
[00:50:15.336 --> 00:50:17.838]  I used to set up chairs for you in the Sun Dome, Pastor.
[00:50:18.561 --> 00:50:19.502]  When your church was there.
[00:50:19.762 --> 00:50:20.062]  Wow.
[00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:20.863]  At USF.
[00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:23.746]  I've been following you for a long time.
[00:50:24.947 --> 00:50:27.970]  Alex, you were instrumental in waking me up after 9-11.
[00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.951]  I've been following you for 22 years.
[00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:29.291]  God bless you.
[00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:41.256]  Really, what moved me to ask you a question is really the evil one pulling us away from our life's purpose.
[00:50:41.556 --> 00:50:51.904]  And I think that that's what I hear you try to inspire us to do so much for the past two decades that I've been listening to you.
[00:50:53.065 --> 00:51:13.550]   And I want you to speak to the mantle that we're Call to carry to bring God's work into the world, because that's really where a lot of the people as a musician, a lot of the people who are sensitive to what's happening for a long, long time get pulled off into addiction.
[00:51:13.949 --> 00:51:20.309]   They get pulled off into rabbit trails and I've been pulled off and around the trails.
[00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:22.429]  I mean, I go on and off alcohol all the time.
[00:51:22.429 --> 00:51:23.429]  So I got my own demons.
[00:51:23.429 --> 00:51:24.429]  I hear what you're saying.
[00:51:24.429 --> 00:51:26.230]  Look, people are going to get this straight.
[00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.230]  They're going to get this straight.
[00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:29.230]  Evil's real.
[00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:30.710]  I've studied the ruling class, what they do.
[00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.230]   They're devil worshipers and they're getting power and they get their own supernatural
[00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.509]  system from it.
[00:51:36.509 --> 00:51:37.828]  We just have to use our authority.
[00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:40.989]  That's infinity more powerful, but we're not using it.
[00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:45.710]   And so I've never, I've been a Christian and I love God, but as things get darker and
[00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.708]   more evil, you see it's all out in the open and everything burns away.
[00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:52.589]   Pastor talks about all the time, but people think, oh, I can beat this.
[00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:54.469]  God's like a rear passenger here.
[00:51:54.472 --> 00:51:57.954]   No God's On the front of the vehicle, the absolute tip of the spear.
[00:51:58.315 --> 00:51:59.695]  We are the people at the back of the bus.
[00:52:00.316 --> 00:52:03.858]  You can't even begin to deal with Satan unless God's a hundred percent.
[00:52:04.158 --> 00:52:05.478]  God just works through us as a vessel.
[00:52:05.538 --> 00:52:08.100]  None of it's us, except our will to submit to God and do it.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.621]  And so it's going to get more and more obvious.
[00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:12.002]  It's ridiculously obvious now.
[00:52:12.422 --> 00:52:15.264]  And the people that serve evil by increments have to do more and more evil.
[00:52:15.544 --> 00:52:17.045]  So they're getting crazier and wilder.
[00:52:17.085 --> 00:52:21.807]  It's Satan's desperateness because the devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[00:52:22.147 --> 00:52:23.048]  That's all I can say to people.
[00:52:23.588 --> 00:52:24.629]  Everybody gets off on rabbit trails.
[00:52:24.869 --> 00:52:32.816]  The biggest thing is, caring what the establishment thinks, or caring what the media thinks, or caring what people that buy the system think, or your neighbor.
[00:52:33.036 --> 00:52:45.887]  I mean, I see these people attacking me on Twitter, and I'll check out their name, and like, a lot of the time it's like, I hate Alex Jones, he's an idiot, he's anti-vaxxers, he's like, my wife's 42, and we're big hikers, but she just had a massive stroke and is dying, please send me money.
[00:52:46.548 --> 00:52:49.692]  And I looked at another one and was like, I just got cancer.
[00:52:49.732 --> 00:52:52.997]  I'm 50 years old and I'm triple vaxxed.
[00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:56.121]  They have articles like, you may get cancer from the shot, but it's okay.
[00:52:56.141 --> 00:52:57.122]  Your doctor will tell you it's fine.
[00:52:57.363 --> 00:53:01.708]  I mean, it's just, look, they're either going to get it or they're going to not get it.
[00:53:01.889 --> 00:53:02.690]  So God bless you, brother.
[00:53:04.833 --> 00:53:06.314]  Hi Alex, nice to meet you.
[00:53:07.115 --> 00:53:12.579]  So I have a lot to ask you but I'm going to ask you one thing that really weighs heavy on my heart because I've seen it for myself.
[00:53:13.579 --> 00:53:17.983]  We lived in Colorado in 2011 and my mother passed away that year.
[00:53:18.983 --> 00:53:26.269]  After being, we had our house pretty much bombarded by the police because they didn't want me to feed my mother green smoothies.
[00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:30.573]  They took custody of her, and I saw this over and over again.
[00:53:30.593 --> 00:53:31.594]  Green smoothies, man.
[00:53:31.614 --> 00:53:32.975]  That's as bad as fentanyl.
[00:53:33.236 --> 00:53:38.321]  They said that I fed her green slime, and they took her out of my custody, out of my home.
[00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:38.681]  Wow.
[00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:40.383]  This is right after the Patriot Act.
[00:53:40.683 --> 00:53:46.049]  They came in with armed guards and literally blocked the door and spoke to a woman that only spoke German at the time.
[00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:47.430]  And did they do that off some tip?
[00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:48.451]  Some neighbor?
[00:53:48.771 --> 00:53:49.192]  Some person?
[00:53:49.232 --> 00:53:50.333]  Like, they're feeding her green slime.
[00:53:50.553 --> 00:53:52.074]  Yeah, just some neighbor, you know?
[00:53:52.494 --> 00:53:54.774]  So, well, this is... Green smoothies are really good for you.
[00:53:54.814 --> 00:53:55.095]  Yeah.
[00:53:55.455 --> 00:54:02.697]  So, while that... Anyway, so they took custody of my mom, who later on, believe it or not, they murdered with morphine.
[00:54:02.857 --> 00:54:05.458]  But by the way, hospice is a murder machine.
[00:54:05.518 --> 00:54:06.058]  No, that's what they do.
[00:54:06.078 --> 00:54:07.098]  Just in case you don't know.
[00:54:07.498 --> 00:54:08.539]  They're a murder machine.
[00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:10.499]  And I watch it... Well, they did that under fentanyl.
[00:54:10.519 --> 00:54:10.879]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:10.919 --> 00:54:12.600]  I mean, they did that under the COVID deal.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.040]  Yeah, they did.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.221]  But I don't think a lot of people are really aware of that, because they're very trusting.
[00:54:16.541 --> 00:54:18.162]  And they need to, like, drop their trust.
[00:54:19.082 --> 00:54:21.524]  Yeah, the social contract in the system's broken.
[00:54:21.884 --> 00:54:27.987]  Some hospitals are good, some groups are good, but half the time, they're just a zombie following a computer program's order.
[00:54:28.608 --> 00:54:31.870]  And so, that's what's happening, is they're taking human decisions out of things.
[00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:44.337]  We don't want autonomous drones, robots, not just in our military, everywhere, where humans are taken out of the decision-making process, and if you don't fight that, they're gonna give you some chicken feed, some money in your ESG, in your universal basic income.
[00:54:45.552 --> 00:54:46.733]  But in the end, you'll be destroyed.
[00:54:46.874 --> 00:54:47.114]  Go ahead.
[00:54:47.214 --> 00:54:47.674]  That's right.
[00:54:47.754 --> 00:54:50.698]  So anyway, so at her funeral... I'm sorry about your mother.
[00:54:51.198 --> 00:54:51.599]  Thank you.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:55:05.534]  Actually, it taught me a lot and it opened my eyes to a lot of things because there were actually people that spoke to me and pulled me in the room like the funeral director who told me that anyone over 50 does not get an autopsy, even though they kept feeding her morphine every day.
[00:55:06.144 --> 00:55:08.144]  Yes, legalized euthanasia.
[00:55:08.144 --> 00:55:13.144]   Yeah, it's legal euthanasia and they just have a field day doing it and people need to become aware.
[00:55:13.144 --> 00:55:18.144]   So, during that process I saw a lot and the other thing that I saw was
[00:55:18.144 --> 00:55:23.144]   I started to wonder what happened to all the bodies because there's cemeteries everywhere and they're completely full.
[00:55:23.144 --> 00:55:25.144]  But people were dying every day.
[00:55:25.144 --> 00:55:30.144]   There's no way that all those people can fit into one cemetery and not everybody gets a cremation.
[00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.933]  So when I started to see all this, I also met another lady.
[00:55:33.993 --> 00:55:34.613]  I'm going to jump him.
[00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:39.176]  I saw another lady whose son had a heart disease and he died very young.
[00:55:40.357 --> 00:55:54.701]  Well, it turns out that in our small town of Montrose, Colorado, there were a bunch of people that died, young people, old people, and they were literally, the funeral homes were taking the bodies of these people that were there, and they were taking them for body parts.
[00:55:55.421 --> 00:55:59.222]  Which was amazingly shocking to everybody, because nobody would listen.
[00:55:59.382 --> 00:56:01.122]  Yeah, we're being turned into a commodity.
[00:56:01.403 --> 00:56:03.003]  None of this is a conspiracy, it's all a fact.
[00:56:03.363 --> 00:56:03.944]  Exactly.
[00:56:04.044 --> 00:56:15.215]  So they were taking the body parts and they give the family urns, which they think is their family member, but it actually was ground down cement when it was tested.
[00:56:16.089 --> 00:56:17.470]  But they're all in on it, folks.
[00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:18.671]  They're all in on it.
[00:56:19.072 --> 00:56:22.215]  So my question is, what are we going to do?
[00:56:22.715 --> 00:56:28.741]  So my question is, what are we going to do to stop this atrocity and this holocaust that's happening?
[00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:29.962]  It's happening to the children.
[00:56:30.282 --> 00:56:32.565]  It's happening to the elderly in the nursing homes.
[00:56:32.905 --> 00:56:34.246]  It's happening to a lot of people every day.
[00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:35.587]  We're going to have to research it.
[00:56:35.607 --> 00:56:36.769]  We're going to have to pray to God.
[00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:38.690]  We're going to have to speak up and take control of our lives.
[00:56:42.645 --> 00:56:43.246]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:43.406 --> 00:56:44.726]  Hey, good evening, Pastor.
[00:56:44.766 --> 00:56:45.446]  I'm Alex.
[00:56:45.666 --> 00:56:47.427]  So I have a two-part question.
[00:56:48.047 --> 00:56:51.068]  How do you feel about DeSantis being president?
[00:56:52.228 --> 00:56:53.669]  I mean, it's not going to happen now.
[00:56:53.769 --> 00:56:56.510]  Trump's 30 points ahead of him after the indictment.
[00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:00.291]  And I think DeSantis just needs to be the governor of Florida and do a great job.
[00:57:03.732 --> 00:57:06.353]  Trump won the last election.
[00:57:07.105 --> 00:57:11.729]  And now they've indicted him so that we can't vote for who we want.
[00:57:12.209 --> 00:57:14.731]  And so that's what I think should be done with DeSantis.
[00:57:15.372 --> 00:57:20.776]  I like DeSantis, but I think he's really been weakened by going under kind of the RNC's operations.
[00:57:20.796 --> 00:57:21.417]  Jeb Bush, yeah.
[00:57:21.457 --> 00:57:22.398]  Go ahead.
[00:57:22.798 --> 00:57:23.298]  Jeb Bush.
[00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:24.579]  Jeb Bush, yeah.
[00:57:24.619 --> 00:57:25.180]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:31.485]  So you answered my other question, which was, do you feel that he's better off being a governor?
[00:57:32.286 --> 00:57:32.526]  Yes.
[00:57:34.628 --> 00:57:35.869]  I think he's a good man overall.
[00:57:36.664 --> 00:57:40.547]  And I think you should understand that Trump had the election.
[00:57:40.607 --> 00:57:41.988]  We had the election stolen from us.
[00:57:42.468 --> 00:57:43.749]  And all the polls show that now.
[00:57:43.769 --> 00:57:45.290]  20 points out of Biden.
[00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:47.192]  They have all the Republican candidates.
[00:57:47.212 --> 00:57:49.053]  Trump gets 65-70% of the vote.
[00:57:49.373 --> 00:57:50.875]  He'd win by 20-30 points today.
[00:57:51.375 --> 00:57:52.175]  And it's backfired on them.
[00:57:52.195 --> 00:57:54.837]  That's why they want to put him in jail so we can't vote for who we want.
[00:57:55.078 --> 00:57:57.259]  That's election meddling 100% proven.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:02.323]  And I think I should just go on record and say there is nobody to vote for other than Trump.
[00:58:02.343 --> 00:58:04.144]  There's nobody.
[00:58:04.324 --> 00:58:04.845]  There's nobody.
[00:58:05.936 --> 00:58:07.957]  We're going to repeal the 22nd Amendment right now.
[00:58:07.797 --> 00:58:10.797]  anybody is on the top, unless if Alex runs.
[00:58:10.797 --> 00:58:11.797]  No, no.
[00:58:11.797 --> 00:58:22.797]  We're going to repeal the 22nd amendment right now.
[00:58:22.797 --> 00:58:23.797]  Go ahead sir, you're on the air.
[00:58:23.797 --> 00:58:24.797]  You're on the air.
[00:58:24.797 --> 00:58:27.797]  This guy's got more energy than me.
[00:58:28.576 --> 00:58:30.317]  I'm having fun, but I'm cross-eyed tired.
[00:58:31.197 --> 00:58:37.321]  We got back from Miami, and I didn't go to bed until like 1 a.m., and I got up at like 6 a.m., but I'm feeling good.
[00:58:38.142 --> 00:58:38.602]  Woo!
[00:58:38.722 --> 00:58:39.863]  Feeling good, feeling right.
[00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:41.264]  Sunday night.
[00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.545]  All right, Alex, so... Go ahead, brother.
[00:58:43.845 --> 00:58:51.830]  I know you kind of teased it the other day, but as a local boy, I'd like to say that we loved having you in Tampa, so... I love western Florida.
[00:58:54.039 --> 00:58:55.840]  I also want to thank you, as a first responder.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:00.801]  You were very supportive over the last three years, and I think you kept a lot of us sane, so I just want to tell you that I appreciate that.
[00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:01.481]  God bless you, brother.
[00:59:01.501 --> 00:59:02.561]  God bless you for your work.
[00:59:02.882 --> 00:59:05.182]  And having said that, so I've got two different careers.
[00:59:05.562 --> 00:59:06.503]  I'm a small business owner.
[00:59:06.523 --> 00:59:07.543]  I'm also a first responder.
[00:59:07.563 --> 00:59:08.363]  Beautiful.
[00:59:08.443 --> 00:59:11.204]  And what I've seen is that the people are diametrically opposed.
[00:59:11.584 --> 00:59:13.725]  In my first responder life, everybody's awake.
[00:59:14.005 --> 00:59:14.785]  A hundred percent, man.
[00:59:14.805 --> 00:59:16.645]  I mean, our uptake on the shop is... Because you live in the real world.
[00:59:16.665 --> 00:59:20.088]   That's why police and first responders And auto mechanics and farmers.
[00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:25.073]  Like Thomas Jefferson said, people that actually work for a living can't be conned because you live in the real world.
[00:59:25.313 --> 00:59:26.034]  And I salute you.
[00:59:26.415 --> 00:59:28.857]  And that's why the system has a problem, why they want robots.
[00:59:28.957 --> 00:59:35.505]  Because they've got to remove humans that live in reality out of it and have all these pod people that grow in these high-rise buildings.
[00:59:36.089 --> 00:59:36.590]  That's it, brother.
[00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:42.837]  So that was my question for you, is what is your thought process or what is your opinion as to the reason why they're so diametrically opposed?
[00:59:42.897 --> 00:59:51.947]  And you somewhat answered that, but is there one particular subculture class or even career choice that you find that people are overwhelmingly awake versus the others?
[00:59:55.484 --> 01:00:02.152]  I mean, I really think like firefighters and EMTs, I don't really ever meet any of them that aren't awake.
[01:00:02.172 --> 01:00:09.401]  I mean, anywhere I go, I'm like, because they literally go to the houses with the people OD'd and see the dead bodies and all the police as well.
[01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:14.948]  Some of the police are brainwashed, but I feel like the firefighters and EMTs are like one of the most awake groups.
[01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:20.347]  And then you've got, you know, people that, like the police, are some of the most alike.
[01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:24.068]  That's why the Soros group's trying to break them and take them over and intimidate them, because they want control.
[01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:24.968]  They're not going to get rid of the police.
[01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.528]  They're going to take them over and put their people in.
[01:00:27.088 --> 01:00:35.430]  And then, you know, there's doctors and people, but a lot of doctors and nurses can't handle the pressure, so they either totally convert to evil or they're good.
[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.331]  But the hospital systems are really trying to take them over.
[01:00:38.611 --> 01:00:40.551]  The devil's trying to take over every profession right now.
[01:00:41.311 --> 01:00:46.115]  And I think small farmers, people like that, small business owners, people that live in the real world.
[01:00:46.596 --> 01:00:53.722]  And that's why it's so sad for young people, because they're more and more being brought up not knowing how to cook dinner, not knowing how to clean the house, not knowing how to change a tire.
[01:00:54.382 --> 01:00:59.226]  And my kids are great, but I've been guilty of that too, because I'm so busy here, I'll just do it, or somebody else do it.
[01:00:59.266 --> 01:01:01.108]  You've got to have basic skills.
[01:01:01.948 --> 01:01:06.069]  Uh, uh, and, uh, you know, like Red Fox used to say, you gotta wash your ass.
[01:01:06.089 --> 01:01:07.070]  Sorry, I'm being bad.
[01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:07.850]  I'm being bad.
[01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:12.972]  The point is, the point is, we gotta get the young people involved to grow a garden, to change a tire.
[01:01:13.192 --> 01:01:15.292]  Hey, we've got big-ass fans in the pavilion.
[01:01:15.332 --> 01:01:16.593]  Relax.
[01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:17.773]  Listen to me.
[01:01:17.973 --> 01:01:29.637]  One of the things that we talked about, even for River University, was we're gonna be implementing basic skills of all of these things to train the first years in even how to cook some food.
[01:01:30.297 --> 01:01:33.839]  Because they can get them off of living on ramen noodles and stuff like that.
[01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.540]  And we're built by God to do all this.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:41.443]  We're meant to garden, we're meant to cook food, we're meant to climb trees, and we're meant to stand up for ourselves too.
[01:01:41.463 --> 01:01:43.524]  Awesome.
[01:01:43.544 --> 01:01:44.844]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:51.468]  Hey Alex Jones, I gotta say I moved here like three weeks ago and I didn't expect I'd actually be able to see you in person.
[01:01:51.968 --> 01:01:52.708]  God bless you, brother.
[01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:53.689]  Yeah, God bless you.
[01:01:53.729 --> 01:01:54.869]  I moved from California.
[01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:56.650]  I got out right when I had an opportunity.
[01:01:57.391 --> 01:01:59.572]  And I just want to say God bless you.
[01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.526]  For all the work you do?
[01:02:02.747 --> 01:02:04.289]  And, uh, I have one question.
[01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:06.751]  Uh, I have this irk on my mind.
[01:02:06.771 --> 01:02:09.594]  Uh, I gotta say, uh, Jordan Maxwell.
[01:02:10.095 --> 01:02:11.036]  He passed away now.
[01:02:11.536 --> 01:02:13.338]  I learned something really interesting from him.
[01:02:13.358 --> 01:02:15.680]  I've always wanted to kind of throw by your way.
[01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:21.446]  Uh, this 1871 Declaration of Washington, D.C.
[01:02:21.526 --> 01:02:22.587]  as a separate unit.
[01:02:23.367 --> 01:02:53.420]   A country turned, per se, based on what he's explaining, into a corporation, under the rug, of people's knowledge, of their understanding, basically that we live, in my opinion, as to my question, that we say we live in a country, but on this institutional level, all this work has been done by the globalists, by these bankers, by the British Empire, per se, What do we do if this is true?
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.161]  What do we do?
[01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:59.171]  If everything, as Marx said, you control reality by controlling history.
[01:02:59.973 --> 01:03:00.594]  What do we do?
[01:03:01.696 --> 01:03:05.738]  To implement the correct knowledge for the people in the world.
[01:03:05.818 --> 01:03:06.838]  That's a big question.
[01:03:07.379 --> 01:03:08.739]  I think we do what we're doing right here.
[01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:13.581]  All these questions, all these comments, immersing ourselves, thinking, all that stuff.
[01:03:13.981 --> 01:03:17.143]  But yeah, I mean, if you look at the Vatican, it's its own sovereign city.
[01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:19.044]  Israel is its own sovereign thing.
[01:03:19.684 --> 01:03:21.445]  Washington DC is its own thing.
[01:03:22.105 --> 01:03:23.986]  The city of London within London is its own thing.
[01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:26.527]  And the globalist plan to collapse all the nation states.
[01:03:26.867 --> 01:03:31.911]  And like Hunger Games, only have city-states around the world that are exempt and run the rest of the planet.
[01:03:32.171 --> 01:03:33.652]  So that's actually the globalist model.
[01:03:34.172 --> 01:03:39.035]  And yeah, the District of Columbia and States of Emergency, all that is in place.
[01:03:39.476 --> 01:03:40.336]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:41.257]  It's all a fraud.
[01:03:41.597 --> 01:03:44.679]  So the minute we wake up to it and say it's not legitimate, it goes down.
[01:03:44.899 --> 01:03:47.561]  So this whole process is what it's about.
[01:03:49.222 --> 01:03:49.903]  Alright, awesome.
[01:03:50.023 --> 01:03:50.303]  Go ahead.
[01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:53.852]  Hello, my name is Margarita.
[01:03:53.912 --> 01:04:01.242]  I'm here with my kids and I want to appreciate everything you do.
[01:04:01.322 --> 01:04:06.830]  If you wouldn't mind taking a picture with me and my kids.
[01:04:07.879 --> 01:04:08.960]  Absolutely.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:09.821]  I missed part of that.
[01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:11.622]  She wants a picture with you.
[01:04:11.822 --> 01:04:12.543]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:12.623 --> 01:04:14.204]  I appreciate everything you do.
[01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:21.090]  You literally, in verbatim, saved my life, saved the life of my kids, because we didn't take that job.
[01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:24.113]  And I'm forever in debt for you.
[01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.316]  Ma'am, ma'am, you're not in debt to me.
[01:04:28.336 --> 01:04:29.276]  I want to explain something.
[01:04:29.296 --> 01:04:29.596]  No.
[01:04:29.736 --> 01:04:35.059]  I have empathy for you, I have empathy for me, but God gave us that because if you're getting hurt and I don't care, I'm going to get hurt next, okay?
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.682]  So all this stuff God gave us, empathy and things, if they can run over you, they can run over me.
[01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:41.703]  So when they run over you, they're running over me.
[01:04:41.763 --> 01:04:42.284]  You understand that?
[01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.505]  Like Christ said, what you do to these children, you've done to me.
[01:04:44.945 --> 01:04:46.106]  So that's the same thing.
[01:04:46.446 --> 01:04:47.607]  You don't owe me anything.
[01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.588]  All you owe is everybody.
[01:04:49.868 --> 01:04:52.229]  You've now got to warn everybody about the poison shots.
[01:04:52.429 --> 01:04:55.171]   And like the pastor said, They're getting ready for round two, baby.
[01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.071]  They're coming.
[01:04:56.411 --> 01:04:57.892]  They're coming worse than last time.
[01:04:58.072 --> 01:04:59.152]  We gotta warn everybody.
[01:04:59.432 --> 01:05:00.793]  That last person said, what do we do?
[01:05:01.173 --> 01:05:11.217]  We run around and warn people right now about the evil of this takeover and that only God can empower us and give us the intelligence and the discernment and the map in our minds to defeat the enemy.
[01:05:13.878 --> 01:05:14.758]  So I appreciate you.
[01:05:18.026 --> 01:05:23.129]  I would like to leave my information, my cell phone number, my email, my name.
[01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:29.252]  If you ever need anything like volunteering for your Infowars, I'm always ready.
[01:05:29.452 --> 01:05:30.613]  Okay, well thank you so much.
[01:05:30.953 --> 01:05:32.434]  Come quickly, let's take a picture.
[01:05:33.594 --> 01:05:34.315]  Bring your boys.
[01:05:34.335 --> 01:05:36.776]  Where are you from?
[01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:36.956]  Russia.
[01:05:38.677 --> 01:05:39.338]  From Russia.
[01:05:40.518 --> 01:05:42.518]  Uh oh, she's gonna get us.
[01:05:42.518 --> 01:05:44.518]  [laughter]
[01:05:44.518 --> 01:05:46.518]  [applause]
[01:05:46.518 --> 01:05:48.518]  [applause]
[01:05:48.518 --> 01:05:50.518]  Now everybody's doing the picture thing.
[01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:52.518]  That's gonna run me in the...
[01:05:51.905 --> 01:05:58.905]  I think this is called Russian collusion.
[01:05:58.905 --> 01:06:07.905]  Slava Bogo.
[01:06:07.905 --> 01:06:17.905]   Hello, my name is Christian, this is my son Gabriel, and I've been following you for years.
[01:06:18.214 --> 01:06:20.695]  I know you got a vintage shirt, we haven't sold that in six, seven years.
[01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:21.295]  That's right.
[01:06:22.016 --> 01:06:38.661]  I was born 9-11-83, 9-11-01 was my 18th birthday, and I was in the hospital, bronchitis, pneumonia, the flu, sitting in front of that TV, had nowhere else to go, saw that BBC said that World Trade Center 7 fell due to fires on multiple floors, and I was standing in the background, and that's when I knew I was being lied to.
[01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:42.862]  Alex Hyde, who you know as Winston Smith, has done some cybertech for you before.
[01:06:43.402 --> 01:06:43.862]  Beautiful!
[01:06:43.722 --> 01:06:45.922]  He showed me all your films and stuff.
[01:06:45.922 --> 01:06:48.361]  And ever since then, I've been into it.
[01:06:48.361 --> 01:06:50.061]  We launched federaljack.com.
[01:06:50.061 --> 01:06:51.362]  I run darkdocs.com.
[01:06:51.362 --> 01:06:54.262]   I'm the front man of Sacred Owls, an anti-New World Order band.
[01:06:54.262 --> 01:06:57.202]   We've gone to the Bohemian Grove twice and protested at the gates.
[01:06:57.202 --> 01:06:58.901]  We've been all over the country.
[01:06:58.901 --> 01:06:59.502]  Beautiful.
[01:06:59.502 --> 01:07:04.740]   Today is my son's 13th birthday, and he wants nothing more than just to take a picture with you
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.781]  and us give you one of our stickers.
[01:07:06.781 --> 01:07:07.342]  Let's do it.
[01:07:07.342 --> 01:07:08.342]  Death to the New World Order.
[01:07:08.342 --> 01:07:29.341]  (Applause.)
[01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:30.341]  Isn't that awesome?
[01:07:31.002 --> 01:07:32.143]  Happy birthday, young man.
[01:07:36.149 --> 01:07:40.515]  Love you, um, I'm not gonna take up that much time so I just got three quick things to ask you.
[01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:43.639]  One, uh, are they gonna take the next election?
[01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:45.742]  Two, why are you not murdered yet?
[01:07:45.842 --> 01:07:47.485]  And three, can I get a picture?
[01:07:47.505 --> 01:07:48.346]  A selfie?
[01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:49.387]  What was the third one?
[01:07:50.128 --> 01:07:51.370]  I just need a selfie, if I can.
[01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:52.811]  All right, all right, all right.
[01:07:52.911 --> 01:07:53.611]  But do the question.
[01:07:53.631 --> 01:07:55.292]  They're already stealing the election.
[01:07:55.432 --> 01:07:57.873]  They're saying they've indicted Trump multiple times.
[01:07:57.893 --> 01:07:58.953]  They've got more indictments coming.
[01:07:59.233 --> 01:08:00.754]  They're saying you can't vote for him.
[01:08:01.835 --> 01:08:04.616]  And they already tried to stop a bunch of Congress people, like 20 of them.
[01:08:04.996 --> 01:08:11.839]  Democrat lawyers went and tried to get them disqualified from running for Congress again because they were at the Capitol on January 6th inside.
[01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:14.180]  They're openly election stealing.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.661]  Of course they stole 2020.
[01:08:15.701 --> 01:08:20.863]  They tried to steal 2022, but the landslide was so big a few Republicans still got in.
[01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:23.284]  And the question of why I'm still alive?
[01:08:23.304 --> 01:08:25.906]  Because God's in control and it's keeping me alive.
[01:08:27.767 --> 01:08:28.908]  And that's why I don't have any fear.
[01:08:28.948 --> 01:08:31.750]  I'll be alive as long as God wants me to be.
[01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:33.731]  You know, God's got me totally backed up.
[01:08:33.931 --> 01:08:34.852]  You know who the bad guy is?
[01:08:34.912 --> 01:08:38.154]  It's me when I pig out and don't sleep and don't take care of myself.
[01:08:38.434 --> 01:08:39.154]  I'm my biggest enemy.
[01:08:39.394 --> 01:08:41.816]  But the New World Order is never going to touch me until God decides.
[01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:45.258]  And if God decides they're going to gun me down next week, get it going!
[01:08:45.298 --> 01:08:46.019]  I'm not worried about it.
[01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:49.441]  Because they don't have control over me and I'm not living in fear.
[01:08:53.097 --> 01:08:53.657]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:08:55.338 --> 01:08:55.798]  Hey, Alex.
[01:08:55.858 --> 01:08:56.898]  My name's Ryan.
[01:08:57.138 --> 01:09:00.119]  I'd ask to shake your hand, but my hands are really sweaty right now.
[01:09:00.519 --> 01:09:01.200]  Mine are, too.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.320]  And I'm with Roger Stone.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.341]  He said Friday you should move to Sarasota.
[01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:09.102]  He tells me the better place to move is up by his ranch.
[01:09:09.182 --> 01:09:12.864]  Anyway, my question to you is, you talk a lot about... Sarasota gets hit by hurricanes.
[01:09:12.884 --> 01:09:13.924]  No, we don't.
[01:09:13.944 --> 01:09:15.164]  I lost a fence in Ian.
[01:09:15.204 --> 01:09:15.825]  No big deal.
[01:09:16.065 --> 01:09:16.725]  I rebuilt it.
[01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:21.150]  But my question is, you talk a lot about the Great Awakening paralleling the Great Reset.
[01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:22.371]  And I agree with you.
[01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:23.692]  I see it happening everywhere.
[01:09:24.333 --> 01:09:29.699]  My stepmom, who's a teacher, a registered Democrat up in New Jersey, COVID woke her up.
[01:09:30.159 --> 01:09:31.241]  And I'm seeing it left and right.
[01:09:31.261 --> 01:09:32.682]  They overplayed their hand.
[01:09:32.882 --> 01:09:33.523]  Yeah, they did.
[01:09:33.543 --> 01:09:34.204]  A lot of people are.
[01:09:34.284 --> 01:09:55.620]   But I know a lot of people that are still Much asleep very hypnotized believe everything the fake news says I want to know what Alex Jones would say just the most simple introductory Statement to plant that seed that tic-tac in their mind that might wake them up I would just say deep down inside you know you're being lied to and you know submitting of this is gonna destroy you and
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.600]  But you're scared deep down inside.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.242]  You're living denial, but you're designed to know the truth and designed to resist tyranny.
[01:10:02.482 --> 01:10:09.763]  And God's got a plan for you and understand that and say, so when things get worse later, remember your submission only makes it worse.
[01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.284]  So you've got a chance to wake up and say no.
[01:10:12.544 --> 01:10:15.625]  And now the ball's in your court because we can't save everybody.
[01:10:19.906 --> 01:10:20.226]  Go ahead.
[01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:24.511]  Hey, thank you Pastor Rodney and Danica for having Alex out today.
[01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:25.992]  I mean, it was such a blessing.
[01:10:26.032 --> 01:10:27.892]  My dad calls you a hero, sir.
[01:10:28.613 --> 01:10:39.637]  Um, my question to you is, um, what was going on in Florida about April with all the cell phones mysteriously going off at 4 45 in the morning?
[01:10:41.397 --> 01:10:43.918]  You know, I don't know about the particular case.
[01:10:43.938 --> 01:10:46.219]  It only happened to people that had Obama phones.
[01:10:48.638 --> 01:10:55.582]  Well, look, I mean, I remember 25 years ago, there were articles, congressional reports, that they were going to have constant alerts and start with the kidnapped kids.
[01:10:55.622 --> 01:10:56.263]  Sounds reasonable.
[01:10:56.683 --> 01:11:02.367]  And then in the future, they were going to have, California already tried this, digital license plates that show this person's missing.
[01:11:02.407 --> 01:11:07.650]  I mean, it's all about government being able to cut off the Internet and then put their messages.
[01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:10.912]  That's the Internet kill switch that they passed under Obama.
[01:11:11.332 --> 01:11:19.797]   So there is a program in place, still in place now, In fact, when Trump got elected, there were articles like, what if Trump uses the internet kill switch?
[01:11:19.998 --> 01:11:21.259]  Which really means the takeover switch.
[01:11:21.499 --> 01:11:21.980]  He never did.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:29.467]  But yeah, Joe Biden and his handlers can take control of all AM, all FM, VHF, UHF, cable.
[01:11:30.567 --> 01:11:35.833]  Everything but shortwave radio and ham operations, and of course, you in the street.
[01:11:36.073 --> 01:11:48.727]  So if they, quote, this is how they're going to do it, because they war-gamed it, they go, oh, right-wing terrorists have, working with the Russians, have, they already said this, have hit the power grid and one of the five grids in the U.S.
[01:11:48.787 --> 01:11:49.108]  is down.
[01:11:49.748 --> 01:11:53.409]  We have to cut the internet off because they're using that to attack our systems.
[01:11:53.729 --> 01:11:56.310]  You'll only be off a few weeks, 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:11:57.351 --> 01:12:01.592]  And then once it comes back, it'll all be their messages that works.
[01:12:02.092 --> 01:12:03.873]  Oh, the virus is back too!
[01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.994]  So it's one of the... Oh, there's some people that don't agree with us.
[01:12:07.234 --> 01:12:10.915]  We're having to take them to emergency centers because they just get engaged in a mass shooting.
[01:12:11.356 --> 01:12:14.917]  I already war game this years ago, but now after I did, it's all on the show.
[01:12:14.937 --> 01:12:15.577]  People are freaking out.
[01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.457]  They're like, how does he know this?
[01:12:16.477 --> 01:12:17.798]  I already watch the enemy constantly.
[01:12:18.038 --> 01:12:20.379]   They're like, Right-wingers are working with Russians.
[01:12:20.399 --> 01:12:21.760]  They're going to blow up things.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.181]  And they're going to attack the power grid through cyberspace.
[01:12:24.582 --> 01:12:27.823]  And we've got to turn off the internet soon and arrest them all.
[01:12:28.404 --> 01:12:33.887]  So it's like, well, your power is off in many areas, and your internet's been off for weeks, even if that's not.
[01:12:34.287 --> 01:12:38.870]  If you just let us arrest the Trump supporters, we'll be able to turn the internet back on.
[01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:41.169]  And of course, it's a message.
[01:12:41.429 --> 01:12:48.111]  We turn the internet off, do what we say, thinking the public will Stockholm Syndrome and not go, gee, we're dealing with martial law.
[01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:52.552]  They'll be like, well, Mildred, let's just go ahead and do what they say and let them arrest our neighbors.
[01:12:53.012 --> 01:13:00.374]  And then once they're just waiting for the last domino to fall and not have preachers and others say, no, we're staying open or no, this is a lie.
[01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:04.375]  They want to cut the stuff off and bring in martial law.
[01:13:04.575 --> 01:13:08.796]  But they already hit us with their number one plan under Operation Lockstep.
[01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:13.802]  They believed that the UN, in their own documents, the best way to bring in global government would be this attack.
[01:13:14.602 --> 01:13:15.323]  And it failed.
[01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:18.263]  Despite their censorship and everything they did, it failed.
[01:13:18.523 --> 01:13:19.744]  They killed a lot of people.
[01:13:20.164 --> 01:13:21.484]  They starved the third world.
[01:13:21.784 --> 01:13:23.045]  They caused a lot of pain.
[01:13:23.345 --> 01:13:27.086]  But, at the end, we woke up to it and it made us ten times stronger.
[01:13:27.346 --> 01:13:31.127]  So, if they're dumb enough to hit us again, this time it'll be their complete downfall!
[01:13:35.988 --> 01:13:36.269]  Thank you.
[01:13:37.529 --> 01:13:37.869]  Go ahead.
[01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:39.371]  Hi, my name is Angela.
[01:13:39.411 --> 01:13:40.371]  I'm from Cape Coral.
[01:13:41.572 --> 01:13:42.973]  That one was for you for the hurricane.
[01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.455]  We helped Cape Coral.
[01:13:46.795 --> 01:13:47.455]  I know you did.
[01:13:47.475 --> 01:13:48.736]  We put a lot of money down there.
[01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:52.078]  There was a church right down the street from us, Grace, that you helped a lot.
[01:13:52.118 --> 01:13:53.078]  Sure.
[01:13:53.519 --> 01:13:58.642]  But anyways, so I didn't know how to use the Internet when this Corona stuff started out.
[01:13:58.742 --> 01:13:59.322]  I didn't know how to.
[01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:00.423]  I didn't use the Internet.
[01:14:00.463 --> 01:14:01.583]  I didn't get on videos.
[01:14:01.623 --> 01:14:02.164]  I didn't watch.
[01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.465]  You definitely didn't watch you because my husband liked you.
[01:14:04.505 --> 01:14:06.026]  So I was definitely not going to watch you.
[01:14:09.395 --> 01:14:26.903]  I, you know, I'm sitting there and I started watching all these videos and learning how to use the YouTubes and I've always believed in God and I started having these crazy dreams about this vaccine and I'm like, yo, I gotta start telling people, you know, so I started making these videos and I didn't know about any of this stuff.
[01:14:26.923 --> 01:14:28.164]  That's the Holy Ghost right there!
[01:14:28.284 --> 01:14:33.458]   And I said, I said, you know, They're trying to kill all of us.
[01:14:33.999 --> 01:14:42.061]  And if you people don't get up and do something about it, and if we don't get any strong men to get up and start fighting for us, we're gonna lose our country.
[01:14:42.421 --> 01:14:44.881]  And I'm not gonna stand here and take this anymore.
[01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:55.304]  So, January 6th came around, because, you know, I learned how to use YouTube, so I learned how to watch all the riots, and all the other stuff that I had no clue that was going on whatsoever.
[01:14:55.984 --> 01:14:59.765]  And you were standing out there, and you were talking to people, and I said, I can't believe this.
[01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:11.972]  So I went over to Bandop Video and I started watching and everything and you guys were talking about the vaccine and I cried because I had been telling people and nobody was listening to me.
[01:15:12.452 --> 01:15:14.252]  I lost family members over it.
[01:15:14.432 --> 01:15:17.913]  And you found out there were people that thought the same as you and you weren't alone.
[01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.033]  Exactly.
[01:15:19.053 --> 01:15:22.674]  You're not just alone, you're the majority and people need to know that.
[01:15:23.834 --> 01:15:34.509]   And then last week, when you were sitting here talking with Rodney Howard Brown, I'm listening to it and you're talking about the Adrena clone, the chrome, and you're talking about all this other stuff.
[01:15:34.829 --> 01:15:37.151]  And the thing is, is I saw it happen.
[01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:41.955]  I see what they do to these children in my dreams and I'm not going to take it, okay?
[01:15:42.335 --> 01:15:43.957]  So I went to the school board meeting.
[01:15:44.237 --> 01:15:47.400]  I told them that they're not going to put these damn masks on these children anymore.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.921]  I don't have any children.
[01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:49.862]  But I stood up.
[01:15:50.122 --> 01:15:57.459]   I made three news stations because I yelled at the cops for not doing their constitutional rights by arresting those P.O.S.'
[01:15:57.399 --> 01:16:06.586]  's up there and I actually walked past a person who was wearing their mask and I purposely farted and asked him if he could smell it!
[01:16:08.247 --> 01:16:10.149]  Beautiful job and God bless you, beautiful.
[01:16:09.969 --> 01:16:16.969]  I want to do a, I want to do a, woo!
[01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:18.969]  Yeah, bring it on up here, sweetheart.
[01:16:18.969 --> 01:16:28.969]  Great job, lady.
[01:16:28.969 --> 01:16:31.969]  (audience laughing)
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.160]  Great job.
[01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:34.302]  Great job, lady.
[01:16:34.362 --> 01:16:34.823]  Great job.
[01:16:37.186 --> 01:16:39.186]  Everybody say, "Woo!"
[01:16:39.186 --> 01:16:41.186]  [Cheering]
[01:16:41.186 --> 01:16:43.186]  Woo!
[01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:45.186]  Woo!
[01:16:45.186 --> 01:16:49.186]   When I moved to Florida in 2009, I got sober and alcoholic synonymous.
[01:16:49.186 --> 01:16:51.186]  Totally unrelated, but we used to do that in our meetings.
[01:16:50.836 --> 01:16:51.416]  We'd go, woo!
[01:16:51.876 --> 01:16:53.576]  Every time somebody gets sober, because you know what?
[01:16:53.836 --> 01:16:56.557]  That's a program based on Christianity, but I'm not here to talk about that tonight.
[01:16:56.937 --> 01:17:01.338]  Alex, I hope to see you much more frequently here on the west coast of Florida.
[01:17:01.358 --> 01:17:02.478]  You gotta come, brother.
[01:17:02.858 --> 01:17:08.679]  This is the bastion of freedom in this horrible land that, well, I think we all know.
[01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:14.020]  So, I got turned on to you back in 2007 when you interviewed Aaron Russo.
[01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:16.211]  Powerful, powerful interview.
[01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:18.952]  It's still on YouTube because they don't delete any of your old stuff, right?
[01:17:19.272 --> 01:17:20.052]  You still can find it.
[01:17:20.092 --> 01:17:21.992]  I suggest everyone check that out.
[01:17:22.433 --> 01:17:26.153]  So we know the Globalists, they have 50, 100, 150, 200-year plans, right?
[01:17:26.714 --> 01:17:28.474]  And we're in the midst of one of those plans.
[01:17:28.754 --> 01:17:31.675]  And we're seeing it right now that the currency is devaluing.
[01:17:31.915 --> 01:17:37.276]  Well, we're coming to the end of their beta test and their big move to literally kill 9% of the world.
[01:17:37.316 --> 01:17:38.096]  I mean, that's official.
[01:17:39.427 --> 01:17:41.068]  I mean, so they're out of beta now.
[01:17:41.088 --> 01:17:42.188]  We're now in operational.
[01:17:42.768 --> 01:17:45.029]  You're not going to have to sit around and say, oh, we got to fight for our kids.
[01:17:45.889 --> 01:17:47.290]  You're not going to have to wait anymore.
[01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:48.110]  You're going to see it all.
[01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:49.330]  Just get, I mean, it's coming.
[01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:50.431]  It's not like you want to fight.
[01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:51.191]  I don't want to either.
[01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:53.572]  But somebody starts beating your head and you're going to fight back.
[01:17:53.592 --> 01:17:54.472]  It's here, folks.
[01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:56.133]  And we can't beat this without God.
[01:17:56.153 --> 01:17:56.873]  That's what I keep saying.
[01:17:58.587 --> 01:17:59.708]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:17:59.748 --> 01:18:00.088]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:00.528 --> 01:18:00.748]  Go ahead.
[01:18:00.868 --> 01:18:05.571]  What I got to ask you is, what can you suggest to people to opt out of their systems?
[01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:07.812]  Opt out of their higher education system.
[01:18:08.073 --> 01:18:08.433]  Higher?
[01:18:09.033 --> 01:18:11.094]  Come on, if I see a Harvard degree on that wall, I'm running out.
[01:18:11.114 --> 01:18:12.435]  But everybody's already opting out of it.
[01:18:12.475 --> 01:18:16.737]  That's why their system's collapsing, so they're trying to collapse us and make us do it.
[01:18:17.038 --> 01:18:18.999]  So they're doing this out of weakness.
[01:18:19.479 --> 01:18:22.141]  And so I would just tell the truth and tell people to come to church.
[01:18:22.201 --> 01:18:24.562]  And a church like this, there's not many of them, but they're growing.
[01:18:24.882 --> 01:18:26.103]  And we've just got to do it, brother.
[01:18:27.651 --> 01:18:28.251]  Hey, thanks a bunch, Alex.
[01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:28.631]  God bless you.
[01:18:28.651 --> 01:18:29.452]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:29.492 --> 01:18:31.393]  Thank you to the church and the pastor and everybody.
[01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:32.193]  Go ahead.
[01:18:32.373 --> 01:18:33.433]  Oh, that's another nice shirt.
[01:18:34.054 --> 01:18:34.894]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:18:34.974 --> 01:18:37.175]  I love you, first and foremost.
[01:18:37.215 --> 01:18:39.496]  I listen to you every day, everybody at work.
[01:18:39.556 --> 01:18:45.058]  I drive them nuts because as soon as you come on, I start sending out the links to all my friends and family.
[01:18:45.078 --> 01:18:45.938]  That's how we bypass the AI.
[01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:47.139]  It's human intelligence.
[01:18:47.179 --> 01:18:48.279]  Yes, sir, I do it.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.781]  But I just want to say how grateful I am for you.
[01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:53.682]  I'm grateful to you.
[01:18:53.702 --> 01:18:54.242]  I want to be clear.
[01:18:54.482 --> 01:18:56.703]  We're not going to get out of this without each other's help and God.
[01:18:56.743 --> 01:18:57.944]  So I want to thank you.
[01:18:58.324 --> 01:18:59.124]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:18:59.445 --> 01:19:03.927]  My son turned me on to you four or five years ago.
[01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:05.408]  I didn't know who you were.
[01:19:06.168 --> 01:19:12.471]  And then I started listening and I'm like, Oh my God, this guy really knows what's going on.
[01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.913]  And I just urge everybody to tune into your show.
[01:19:18.394 --> 01:19:20.116]  Like I said, everyday listener.
[01:19:20.236 --> 01:19:21.658]  I buy your products.
[01:19:22.139 --> 01:19:24.181]  I obviously buy your attire.
[01:19:24.201 --> 01:19:27.685]  Well, you're the only reason we're hanging on by our fingernails.
[01:19:28.046 --> 01:19:35.455]  I do the monthly little subscription thing, but I speak of you wherever I go because...
[01:19:36.696 --> 01:19:44.867]  Our planet is in such urgency for change and I'm scared with this next election.
[01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:50.394]  I know you're saying, and we know that they're going to try to steal the election, but what happens if they do steal it?
[01:19:50.895 --> 01:19:52.297]  And Trump is not our leader.
[01:19:52.377 --> 01:19:53.939]  He needs to be our leader.
[01:19:53.959 --> 01:19:54.780]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.962]  Imagine they steal it again and actually Biden won't even be able to talk by that point.
[01:19:59.422 --> 01:20:03.943]  So it's like, you've heard the term, you know, they're damned if they do, they're damned if they don't.
[01:20:03.963 --> 01:20:05.164]  I mean, they are in a lot of trouble.
[01:20:05.564 --> 01:20:09.205]  They just want to trick us into a race war or into violence and we just can't do that.
[01:20:09.706 --> 01:20:10.786]  It's all, we're all together.
[01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.207]  Everybody, everybody's one human family under God.
[01:20:13.727 --> 01:20:16.648]  And everybody knows, and all the real statistics, everybody's coming together.
[01:20:16.948 --> 01:20:18.909]  That's why they're scared, because we're coming together.
[01:20:19.209 --> 01:20:21.430]  That's why they're saying, we're not together, we all hate each other.
[01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:23.491]  They hype up all these stories to get us mad.
[01:20:23.931 --> 01:20:26.232]  No, we're coming together, and they're scared.
[01:20:26.292 --> 01:20:27.993]  So it's the beginning of the end.
[01:20:28.293 --> 01:20:29.394]  They think it's the end of us?
[01:20:29.714 --> 01:20:31.434]  This is the beginning of the end of these devils.
[01:20:31.835 --> 01:20:32.095]  Amen.
[01:20:32.235 --> 01:20:32.615]  And Alex?
[01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:37.618]  I want to let you know, also, I'm born and raised right here in Plant City, Florida.
[01:20:37.798 --> 01:20:39.399]  I hope that you move here soon.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:48.585]  And I am a member of West Coast Florida Riders motorcycle organization.
[01:20:48.905 --> 01:20:50.526]  We all support you.
[01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:51.947]  I have flags.
[01:20:52.007 --> 01:20:54.149]  I would love to take a picture with you.
[01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.589]  Sure, let's go.
[01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:57.151]  And while you take the picture, we're going to get everybody in.
[01:20:57.171 --> 01:20:57.631]  Next question.
[01:20:57.651 --> 01:20:57.971]  Go ahead.
[01:21:00.293 --> 01:21:00.533]  Alex.
[01:21:01.997 --> 01:21:02.597]  You're slacking.
[01:21:02.617 --> 01:21:06.340]  How come you haven't gave a plug for Infowarsstore.com yet?
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.600]  What's going on, man?
[01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:09.862]  T-shirt idea.
[01:21:10.182 --> 01:21:12.083]  Owen Schroyer did nothing wrong.
[01:21:12.103 --> 01:21:13.484]  Right?
[01:21:16.665 --> 01:21:18.446]  Hey.
[01:21:19.227 --> 01:21:20.568]  No, here's my real question though.
[01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:24.450]  Did you...
[01:21:25.723 --> 01:21:31.604]  Did you tell Nick Fuentes, when he came on your show, that Israel is a dead end and mentioning Jews is a dead end?
[01:21:32.004 --> 01:21:34.805]  Do you commit to a debate with him on the JQ?
[01:21:35.225 --> 01:21:37.485]  And will you reinstate his Bandot video account?
[01:21:37.945 --> 01:21:41.626]  Yeah, well just to be clear, I don't know anything about his account.
[01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:42.666]  I haven't even paid attention to that.
[01:21:42.706 --> 01:21:43.746]  But it's your website!
[01:21:43.906 --> 01:21:45.507]  Well, I mean, you want me to answer your question?
[01:21:45.927 --> 01:21:47.167]  I mean, I'll be happy to answer your question.
[01:21:47.207 --> 01:21:50.528]  But, well, repeat them again, because I forgot what they were.
[01:21:50.548 --> 01:21:52.068]  Because I need to answer each question.
[01:21:52.288 --> 01:21:52.488]  Go ahead.
[01:21:53.228 --> 01:22:02.656]  He came on your show, he says, when he came on during the commercial break, you told him, he can say what he wants, you said, you're not censoring him, but Israel's a dead end, talking about the Jews is a dead end.
[01:22:03.757 --> 01:22:04.297]  Is that true?
[01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:04.898]  Did he say that?
[01:22:04.938 --> 01:22:05.558]  I've said that on air!
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.682]  You told him, but you told him to not mention the Jews.
[01:22:09.722 --> 01:22:11.644]  No, no, no, but you told him not to mention the Jews.
[01:22:11.664 --> 01:22:12.684]  Are you going to let me talk?
[01:22:12.705 --> 01:22:13.545]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:22:14.886 --> 01:22:16.608]  You tune in my show every day, I think.
[01:22:16.628 --> 01:22:17.689]  Are you going to let me talk?
[01:22:18.678 --> 01:22:19.158]  What is it?
[01:22:19.659 --> 01:22:20.119]  Let me talk.
[01:22:20.319 --> 01:22:22.161]  Tell you what, you talk till you're done.
[01:22:22.461 --> 01:22:23.402]  When you're done, I'll talk.
[01:22:23.442 --> 01:22:23.762]  Go ahead.
[01:22:25.143 --> 01:22:25.463]  Okay.
[01:22:25.884 --> 01:22:28.105]  Do you commit to a debate on the JQ with Nick?
[01:22:29.146 --> 01:22:30.627]  Well, which question do you want me to answer first?
[01:22:30.667 --> 01:22:31.048]  That one.
[01:22:31.388 --> 01:22:31.728]  That one.
[01:22:31.808 --> 01:22:32.088]  Okay.
[01:22:33.329 --> 01:22:34.590]  I've invited Nick on.
[01:22:35.351 --> 01:22:37.132]  So what you do is you cherry pick stuff.
[01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:38.173]  No, no, no.
[01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:41.095]  And then you sit there and say, I'm willing to debate.
[01:22:41.235 --> 01:22:41.936]  I love debates.
[01:22:42.937 --> 01:22:43.797]  He can come on next week.
[01:22:44.738 --> 01:22:46.239]  He can fly down and come on the show in person.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.381]  So let me finish your other questions.
[01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:52.779]  I am all over the airwaves saying, I don't hate Jews.
[01:22:52.999 --> 01:22:54.000]  I don't hate Catholics.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.142]  Let me let you, you just have this problem with letting people talk.
[01:22:58.323 --> 01:22:59.644]  You've asked a lot of questions.
[01:23:00.545 --> 01:23:03.547]  No, no, that's what, look, it's a, it's a, it's a spirit.
[01:23:03.987 --> 01:23:06.769]  When everybody brings up the Jews, they won't let you talk.
[01:23:07.389 --> 01:23:12.233]  Cause, because you have this fantasy that I worked for the, I have nothing to do with Israel.
[01:23:12.413 --> 01:23:13.193]  Listen, you didn't let me finish.
[01:23:13.434 --> 01:23:14.314]  This guy's gone.
[01:23:14.754 --> 01:23:15.355]  Let me talk.
[01:23:16.135 --> 01:23:23.087]  This guy has gone to Israel and rebuked the Knesset that they don't let him preach the gospel of Jesus Christ there!
[01:23:23.487 --> 01:23:24.268]  Let me finish!
[01:23:24.309 --> 01:23:25.010]  Let me finish!
[01:23:27.672 --> 01:23:36.138]  I am not going to be divided on the people that call me and say, the black people are the problem, or this is the problem, or the Jews are the problem.
[01:23:36.358 --> 01:23:38.900]  There are good Jews, there are bad Jews, there are good Catholics, there are bad Catholics.
[01:23:39.201 --> 01:23:46.166]  My job is to expose the poison shots, and the sex trafficking, and the New World Order, and the nuclear war.
[01:23:48.407 --> 01:23:49.647]  I want the Muslims.
[01:23:50.127 --> 01:23:51.288]  I want the Jews.
[01:23:51.768 --> 01:23:52.888]  I want the Catholics.
[01:23:53.349 --> 01:23:55.850]  I want everybody to find Jesus.
[01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:58.150]  And what I stand for is 100% clear.
[01:24:00.695 --> 01:24:03.277]  That's what I stand for, is Jesus Christ!
[01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:05.018]  That's what I stand for!
[01:24:05.418 --> 01:24:07.279]  And I'll debate anybody anytime!
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:16.545]  I'd say on the air, our problem is not the Jews, our problem is not the Russians, or the Chinese, or the dumbass white supremacists.
[01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.947]  Our problem is the devil!
[01:24:19.367 --> 01:24:21.788]  And the fact that we haven't accepted Jesus Christ!
[01:24:21.648 --> 01:24:28.648]  Jesus Christ! Let's go to the next person!
[01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:30.611]  I don't know how to follow that.
[01:24:30.631 --> 01:24:33.893]  That's why I like to debate though.
[01:24:33.913 --> 01:24:34.653]  That got me to wake up.
[01:24:34.673 --> 01:24:36.214]  I'm having a great time and I'm super exhausted.
[01:24:36.394 --> 01:24:37.534]  Now I go five more hours.
[01:24:37.674 --> 01:24:38.255]  Oh my God.
[01:24:38.955 --> 01:24:39.875]  You afraid to debate?
[01:24:40.095 --> 01:24:40.696]  Are you kidding?
[01:24:40.716 --> 01:24:43.197]  I don't wake up until somebody hits me in the head with a baseball bat.
[01:24:43.217 --> 01:24:44.597]  They would have no better to do that with you.
[01:24:45.898 --> 01:24:50.040]  Anyway, I had the great opportunity of shaking your hand many years ago on the streets of New York.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:51.380]  I have a couple of questions.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:55.522]  One is, for years and years I've heard nothing but white hats.
[01:24:56.306 --> 01:25:03.451]  The good military, the disclosure, everything, all the arrests of the pedophiles, all the movie stars, all the politicians.
[01:25:04.452 --> 01:25:04.952]  Where is it?
[01:25:05.452 --> 01:25:06.013]  Is it a myth?
[01:25:06.293 --> 01:25:07.253]  No, it's not.
[01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:09.555]  Here's what's happened.
[01:25:09.735 --> 01:25:13.137]  There is a psy-op going on for at least 30 years that I know of, because I've been on here 29 years.
[01:25:14.178 --> 01:25:15.339]  You don't have to do anything.
[01:25:15.659 --> 01:25:19.982]  There's a secret group in the government of patriots that's going to fix it all.
[01:25:20.928 --> 01:25:29.097]  Well, funny, all the people I knew that were high-level FBI or government, like Ted Gunnarson said, the black hats are taking over, and this company's in trouble.
[01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:34.122]  And this, you know, so, it's always back to the grassroots, it's back to the people.
[01:25:34.402 --> 01:25:35.783]  There are great people in our military.
[01:25:36.044 --> 01:25:37.345]  There are great people in the law enforcement.
[01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:39.007]  There are great people in universities.
[01:25:39.027 --> 01:25:40.869]  There's great people that work at your bank down the street.
[01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.910]  But they don't run it.
[01:25:43.035 --> 01:25:50.300]  And you see now that there's almost 100% centralized evil in the key positions of only 1,000 or so positions in the world.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.503]  The Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the IMF, the World Bank.
[01:25:53.723 --> 01:25:54.924]  It's a couple hundred men.
[01:25:54.944 --> 01:25:58.944]  A couple hundred men that run all that.
[01:25:58.944 --> 01:26:00.264]  People will say, "Who runs it?"
[01:26:00.264 --> 01:26:01.264]  It's these couple hundred men.
[01:26:01.264 --> 01:26:02.264]  There's a few women.
[01:26:02.264 --> 01:26:06.543]   There are almost all of them are white men and a few Asians and a few people from Latin
[01:26:06.543 --> 01:26:07.543]  America.
[01:26:07.543 --> 01:26:10.064]  But it's a couple hundred men that are literal devil worshippers.
[01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:13.303]   They're bound together by their love of the devil and control and their pride thinking
[01:26:13.303 --> 01:26:14.303]  they're going to rule the earth.
[01:26:14.303 --> 01:26:16.783]   They're given, you know, they literally been taken to the mountain.
[01:26:16.783 --> 01:26:18.544]  Jesus said no to the offer.
[01:26:18.544 --> 01:26:19.544]  They took it.
[01:26:19.544 --> 01:26:20.544]  Okay.
[01:26:20.544 --> 01:26:22.623]  And so that's what binds them together.
[01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:24.605]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:26:24.705 --> 01:26:31.148]  And so this idea that the secret government good guys are going to save us and there's sealed indictments that are coming.
[01:26:31.388 --> 01:26:31.668]  Yeah.
[01:26:31.889 --> 01:26:33.089]  Sealed indictments on Trump.
[01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:34.590]  Sealed indictments on me.
[01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:36.391]  Sealed indictments on Owen Schroer.
[01:26:36.811 --> 01:26:40.073]  That's all the sealed indictments I've been seeing because they control the Justice Department.
[01:26:40.672 --> 01:26:42.454]  Durham couldn't even slap him on the wrist.
[01:26:43.775 --> 01:26:45.596]  Hunter Biden, child porn.
[01:26:45.896 --> 01:26:50.100]  He says, I'm a Chinese communist agent in audio recordings, out for three years.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.122]  He works for Chinese intelligence.
[01:26:52.422 --> 01:26:54.183]  Audio messages to his dad, he kept.
[01:26:54.784 --> 01:26:56.125]  And I played them on air!
[01:26:56.926 --> 01:26:59.088]  And they won't even slap him on the wrist.
[01:26:59.348 --> 01:27:02.590]  So they're letting you know they control the earth, but they don't control your soul.
[01:27:03.031 --> 01:27:06.474]  And so, they're still in power, but they're losing power.
[01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:07.575]  And they're panicking.
[01:27:08.325 --> 01:27:10.926]  But everybody's saying, sit back, it's going to be fine.
[01:27:11.206 --> 01:27:12.867]  Those are children waking up.
[01:27:13.307 --> 01:27:14.248]  I don't mean literal children.
[01:27:14.408 --> 01:27:15.428]  Their minds are like children.
[01:27:15.628 --> 01:27:19.350]  And they wake up to this evil and they go, well there must be good guys coming to save me.
[01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:22.931]  Yeah, look in the mirror, you're the good guy with God working through you.
[01:27:23.192 --> 01:27:23.872]  So that's the answer.
[01:27:26.225 --> 01:27:36.573]  I want to just say something because in my book on the Phantom Virus, there's two chapters that myself and my co-author put in there called the Q Conspiracy.
[01:27:36.613 --> 01:27:44.779]  People were mad at me because what I felt that that did was everybody said just trust the plan and everybody's sitting waiting when there was no plan.
[01:27:45.079 --> 01:27:46.100]  Well isn't the plan in the Bible?
[01:27:46.801 --> 01:27:47.261]  Totally.
[01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:51.763]  But the thing is, they were waiting for this secret group of people that were going to come save.
[01:27:52.063 --> 01:27:53.364]  It's going to happen any day now.
[01:27:53.704 --> 01:27:55.085]  Trump will get back into office.
[01:27:55.365 --> 01:27:59.807]  And you're sitting, you're sitting looking at it going, well, some of you said he's still president.
[01:27:59.847 --> 01:28:01.868]  I said, he's doing a terrible job, isn't he?
[01:28:02.228 --> 01:28:03.969]  So people get mad at me about it.
[01:28:04.009 --> 01:28:11.732]  But the bottom line is, you know, you can't sit and trust the plan and do nothing just because we trusted the plan.
[01:28:12.052 --> 01:28:13.193]  We have to do something.
[01:28:13.713 --> 01:28:17.696]  I'm not trusting any plan of any secret group of people out there.
[01:28:18.116 --> 01:28:21.178]  I trust the Word of God, and I trust what God tells me to do.
[01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:22.439]  Explain, that's Gnostic.
[01:28:22.819 --> 01:28:27.342]  Anytime it says it's secret, and we're hired, we're gonna let you have a little... that's a cult!
[01:28:28.323 --> 01:28:30.984]  Everything with Pastor, it's all out in the open.
[01:28:31.065 --> 01:28:32.325]  You're right, Alex.
[01:28:32.465 --> 01:28:34.446]  I mean, everybody can see what we're doing.
[01:28:34.486 --> 01:28:36.968]  They can turn in to infantwars.com.
[01:28:36.988 --> 01:28:39.389]  They can turn in and find out what you... We don't hide anything.
[01:28:39.409 --> 01:28:45.652]  Well, notice the accusation was, you secretly told somebody, you can attack Israel if you want, but it's a dead end.
[01:28:45.952 --> 01:28:46.833]  I say that on air.
[01:28:47.173 --> 01:28:48.253]  But it has to be like Gnostic.
[01:28:48.694 --> 01:28:50.755]  Ooh, he told me secretly that.
[01:28:51.075 --> 01:28:52.516]  Ooh, he got this secret.
[01:28:52.776 --> 01:28:57.291]   There's nothing that I say It's privately that I don't say publicly.
[01:28:57.311 --> 01:28:58.292]  It's the same with you.
[01:28:58.572 --> 01:28:59.393]  We're an open book.
[01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:00.554]  So there's nothing.
[01:29:00.975 --> 01:29:04.419]  Even if you came behind the scenes, you're not going to learn anything you don't know.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:05.881]  Because we tell it all.
[01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:07.423]  You're going to hear the exact same thing.
[01:29:07.483 --> 01:29:08.224]  You tell it all.
[01:29:08.704 --> 01:29:09.806]  So there's nothing hidden.
[01:29:11.327 --> 01:29:11.648]  Absolutely.
[01:29:11.728 --> 01:29:13.830]  I want to recruit everybody to God and defeat Satan.
[01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:22.820]  So anytime they get you into groups, like when we talked about open borders, they're using open borders to bring down the country, drive down wages, sex trafficking, enslavement.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:24.402]  Those people are victims.
[01:29:24.662 --> 01:29:27.245]  They've been three years, their country's cut off, starving to death.
[01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:28.066]  Then the U.N.
[01:29:28.146 --> 01:29:30.269]  organizes them as a weapon and brings them here.
[01:29:30.449 --> 01:29:33.673]  But when I said they're being used as a weapon, I said they're mainly good people.
[01:29:34.628 --> 01:29:40.511]  Because I'm not going to hate those people that are being driven and starved to death coming here and being fed on by smugglers.
[01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:43.993]  And Amnesty International estimates 80% of women are raped.
[01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:48.235]  I'm going to stand against the UN and Biden and the globalists that are trafficking them.
[01:29:48.355 --> 01:29:51.136]  But my enemy is not those people being starved to death.
[01:29:51.315 --> 01:29:53.315]  It's the same thing!
[01:29:53.315 --> 01:29:57.315]  [applause]
[01:29:57.315 --> 01:30:01.315]   I had one other question, but I'd just take a picture with you instead.
[01:30:01.197 --> 01:30:01.317]  Okay.
[01:30:01.357 --> 01:30:02.858]  Hey, get going there, brother.
[01:30:02.878 --> 01:30:04.579]  The next question, I'm going to multitask.
[01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:05.239]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.180]  Good evening, Mr. Jones.
[01:30:07.241 --> 01:30:08.421]  My name is Joseph.
[01:30:08.861 --> 01:30:27.271]  My question is, what do you say to Christians who love God and whatnot, but go along with the things of the globalists and the banking families, like meatless and lab-grown meat and the plant-based milks and the COVID vaccines and whatnot, because they think it's technically not a sin or not a big deal or we're under grace and whatnot?
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.882]  And I was listening to you, but say it again.
[01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:31.842]  I got 90% of it.
[01:30:32.283 --> 01:30:32.703]  The whole thing?
[01:30:33.944 --> 01:30:35.745]  I heard part of the scripture, I missed the very first.
[01:30:35.885 --> 01:30:36.045]  Okay.
[01:30:36.946 --> 01:30:54.237]  What do you say to Christians who do love God and whatnot, but go along with the things of the globalists anyway, like meatless and lab-grown meat and plant-based milks and the COVID vaccines because they think it's technically not a sin or not a big deal or we're under grace or something like that?
[01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:57.382]  Look, I'm as big a sinner as most people, so I'm out here.
[01:30:57.402 --> 01:31:00.344]  I just know God's real and wants to save me and save all of us together.
[01:31:00.824 --> 01:31:07.288]  And people are going to have to go through their process, but any global sponsored industries, but to poison you and hurt you.
[01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:10.430]  and displace good industries.
[01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:16.750]   So when you buy or do anything they're pushing on you, you might as well self-harm, because that's what it is.
[01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:18.750]  And look, I'm not perfect.
[01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:21.070]   I try to go to mom and pops, I try to go to small businesses.
[01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:22.590]  Sometimes I'm busy, it's the only place I can go.
[01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:23.949]  I go to Walmart sometimes.
[01:31:23.949 --> 01:31:28.510]   But at the end of the day, I know that it's stupid and I might as well be hitting myself in the head with a
[01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.909]  hammer.
[01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:32.851]  But I'm driving out to see my dad, go hunting with him, you know, and oh, I forgot ammo.
[01:31:33.152 --> 01:31:36.094]  I'm gonna pull into Walmart, it's the only place in the way, I'm gonna buy some shells.
[01:31:36.474 --> 01:31:39.516]  But I mean, I should have pulled into a small place, you know what I mean?
[01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:44.059]  You gotta, the more you do it, the more you do it, and look, I'm gonna pay more at a small shop.
[01:31:44.519 --> 01:31:47.201]  But it's funding an American family.
[01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:48.842]  And so it's just a process.
[01:31:48.862 --> 01:31:49.522]  We're not God.
[01:31:50.183 --> 01:31:53.424]  We're not even one trillionth of what even God thinks about in a half a second.
[01:31:53.684 --> 01:31:58.887]  So we just have to do the best we can, move forward, and just know that God is going to guide us.
[01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:00.788]  God bless you, brother.
[01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:03.750]  Want to say something about that, Pastor?
[01:32:05.791 --> 01:32:06.371]  Hi, Alex.
[01:32:06.471 --> 01:32:20.004]   It was an honor to meet you this morning, and I wanted to just ask you a couple questions about how... And before I ask you, I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for No, no, no, but listen, I don't say this to be self-deprecating.
[01:32:20.104 --> 01:32:20.944]  Do not thank me.
[01:32:20.764 --> 01:32:25.264]   And because of you, I haven't taken the shot and I've influenced my parents not to take the shot.
[01:32:25.264 --> 01:32:29.163]   And occasionally my dad will just come back and thank me, like,
[01:32:29.163 --> 01:32:31.463]  "Thank you for telling me not to take it."
[01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:34.764]   Because we have known so many people that have had complications.
[01:32:34.764 --> 01:32:37.462]  And I say, "Don't thank me. Thank Alex Jones."
[01:32:37.462 --> 01:32:41.163]  No, no, no. But listen, I don't say this to be self-deprecating.
[01:32:41.163 --> 01:32:42.663]  Do not thank me.
[01:32:42.663 --> 01:32:46.264]   Thank God for giving us doctors and scientists that warned us.
[01:32:46.264 --> 01:32:49.462]  And then now, warn everybody.
[01:32:50.005 --> 01:32:51.667]  They shouldn't thank you when you warn them.
[01:32:51.848 --> 01:32:52.709]  They're going to warn others.
[01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:53.630]  We're in this together.
[01:32:53.650 --> 01:32:56.976]  And the reason I say don't thank me is I love the thanks and I appreciate it.
[01:32:57.236 --> 01:32:59.960]  But at the end of the day, that's like a low level of this.
[01:33:00.461 --> 01:33:01.543]  They are going to do it again.
[01:33:02.347 --> 01:33:10.112]  So when I see other talk show hosts going super viral exposing the shots of the New World Order, as a man in competition, like a race car driver I was, I want to win the race.
[01:33:10.372 --> 01:33:13.194]  But this isn't a race where, this is more like a relay.
[01:33:13.694 --> 01:33:19.778]  So when I see all these new people that they can't censor and shut down, that have become more successful than I am, that's my victory.
[01:33:19.818 --> 01:33:20.539]  That's God's victory.
[01:33:20.959 --> 01:33:22.780]  So, you know, this is your victory.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:23.480]  It's my victory.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.700]  We are on a team.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.061]  And we're going to beat the New World Order with God's help.
[01:33:27.281 --> 01:33:29.862]  But let me tell you, they're getting a new virus ready that kills kids.
[01:33:30.142 --> 01:33:31.443]  They already telegraphed what they do.
[01:33:31.723 --> 01:33:32.183]  They tell you.
[01:33:32.423 --> 01:33:33.783]  And the next one's going to be way worse.
[01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:35.564]  And it's going to be scary, folks.
[01:33:35.584 --> 01:33:36.724]  They're going to kill a lot of people.
[01:33:36.785 --> 01:33:38.025]  I'm trying to be negative here.
[01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:38.705]  You need to get ready, okay?
[01:33:39.025 --> 01:33:40.866]  This was training wheels you just got hit by.
[01:33:41.106 --> 01:33:43.147]  You just got hit by like a high school boxer.
[01:33:43.667 --> 01:33:44.627]  Mike Tyson is prime.
[01:33:44.647 --> 01:33:46.028]  He's about to punch us right in the nose.
[01:33:46.428 --> 01:33:47.508]  So I'm telling you, you better get ready.
[01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:48.829]  I don't mean that to be scary.
[01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.609]  Get ready!
[01:33:50.697 --> 01:33:51.538]  You hear those drums?
[01:33:51.699 --> 01:33:52.039]  Boom!
[01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:53.842]  Satan's coming!
[01:33:53.822 --> 01:34:00.822]  You better get gone right now.
[01:34:00.822 --> 01:34:02.822]  That goes in line with my question.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:08.005]  So let's say, fast forward to 2024, they've already 90% stolen the election.
[01:34:08.585 --> 01:34:15.552]  At that point, if they can keep Joe Biden alive for four more years or two or whatever, or whoever else they put in, like Newsom.
[01:34:15.812 --> 01:34:17.093]  It's weekend at Bernie's.
[01:34:18.014 --> 01:34:21.877]  He's perfect for them because they can blame him for whatever they do, and he doesn't even know what he did.
[01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:23.839]  He can be a deepfake for four years.
[01:34:23.879 --> 01:34:24.760]  He pretty much already is.
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:26.542]  They have a goldfish as the president, sorry.
[01:34:27.964 --> 01:34:28.625]  Pretty much is.
[01:34:28.985 --> 01:34:39.693]  So at that point, should we be thinking about breaking away in an alternate system, or should we be thinking about ways to influence the current system?
[01:34:39.713 --> 01:34:41.054]  Yeah, that's a huge question.
[01:34:41.074 --> 01:34:43.796]  I am for secession to reconstitute the republic.
[01:34:44.654 --> 01:34:48.778]  So if you had a coalition of states pull out, Florida, Texas, a bunch of others.
[01:34:48.838 --> 01:34:52.783]  If Texas and Florida went, most of the country would go out of the way and say, we vote.
[01:34:52.803 --> 01:34:54.484]  And I'm not even talking about a con-con.
[01:34:54.504 --> 01:35:00.290]  Just the states pull out and say, we're done, under the charter, and it's in the Constitution, right through revolts in the New Hampshire, it's in the Texas Constitution.
[01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:04.970]   They'll try to say that the states out West that were brought in as territories never
[01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:08.490]   had rights to revolt or remove, but it's still there because the original states have it.
[01:35:08.490 --> 01:35:10.211]  It's the Declaration of Independence as well.
[01:35:10.211 --> 01:35:15.810]   But I'm all for removing the Republic and saying we are the Republic and we're founding
[01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:20.170]   the second Republic under the original Declaration of Independence and Constitution and saying
[01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:22.369]  we dissolve this government.
[01:35:22.369 --> 01:35:31.329]   Until 1913 when we got the IRS and the Federal Reserve, senators were not properly elected.
[01:35:31.383 --> 01:35:32.023]  The House was.
[01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:34.244]  Senators were elected by the legislatures.
[01:35:34.464 --> 01:35:37.385]  They would routinely recall Senators if they knew what they were told.
[01:35:37.825 --> 01:35:40.966]  So we need to say, we're invoking that, and I would like to see that.
[01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:45.587]  It would be dangerous to put us in that position because they could try to pass a bunch of bad stuff, but they're already doing it.
[01:35:45.967 --> 01:35:47.668]  So desperate times need desperate measures.
[01:35:47.848 --> 01:35:51.389]  I believe in the states pulling out and then reconstituting a new republic.
[01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:54.110]  A peaceful counter-coup against the globalists.
[01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:54.390]  Thank you.
[01:35:55.805 --> 01:35:56.286]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:35:57.066 --> 01:35:58.227]  Alex Jones, how you doing, man?
[01:35:58.247 --> 01:35:58.708]  Good, brother.
[01:35:58.748 --> 01:36:00.209]  Just, you know, grateful to be here.
[01:36:00.309 --> 01:36:04.433]  My mom loves you so much, you know, and she doesn't listen to me anymore.
[01:36:04.533 --> 01:36:09.518]  So anytime I need to tell her to do something, or I just say, Alex Jones said it on his show, and she'll do it.
[01:36:10.633 --> 01:36:11.573]  What's your mom's name?
[01:36:11.913 --> 01:36:12.274]  Martha.
[01:36:12.694 --> 01:36:14.154]  Tell Martha I said how we love her.
[01:36:14.174 --> 01:36:15.915]  Ah man, she's gonna go crazy.
[01:36:16.975 --> 01:36:19.456]  So, you know, the question I have is real basic to you.
[01:36:19.496 --> 01:36:24.217]  You know, I saw many shows that you've done, especially yesterday on Valuetainment.
[01:36:25.537 --> 01:36:36.112]   You were talking about once you go down this rabbit hole and you start finding out more and more about the truth, the conspiracies, Turning out not being conspiracies, that sometimes you get in too deep.
[01:36:37.134 --> 01:36:40.801]  And the question that I have is, I have a family member who is too deep in my opinion.
[01:36:41.932 --> 01:36:54.696]  When you found yourself down that rabbit hole, and it's tough to get out, was there anything anyone could have said to maybe bring you back a little bit in terms of just living your life, trying to enjoy your life, going to God?
[01:36:56.036 --> 01:37:03.119]  This is probably the best question of the night so far, and I could talk for days about this, and I've been counseled by Pastor Howard about this.
[01:37:05.518 --> 01:37:10.180]  I felt this responsibility when Trump got in, that we could really maybe stop them going into operations.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.881]  And that we were right there on the edge, and it was a chance.
[01:37:13.642 --> 01:37:15.002]  And Trump was impure, we all are.
[01:37:15.823 --> 01:37:16.483]  Imperfect vessel.
[01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:19.310]  And I aged like 10, 15 years with this.
[01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:21.949]  Cause I, every day, like I said, I got to stop them.
[01:37:21.949 --> 01:37:24.750]   I was just constantly thinking about how to beat them with my own mind.
[01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:28.649]  It just literally just like just studying 15 hours a day.
[01:37:28.649 --> 01:37:30.690]  Sometimes it's constantly totally focused.
[01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:35.110]   And, uh, and I, and I almost, I mean, it tore me up and I, and I got, I
[01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:37.630]   don't want to call it depression, but it was more darkness where all I did
[01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:38.750]  was think about what they were doing.
[01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:43.230]   And then, and then God about two years ago said, I told you, I've got this handle.
[01:37:43.369 --> 01:37:45.410]  You just do what I tell you, pull back and be happy.
[01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:48.711]  And it's taken me over a year and a half just to halfway pull out of it.
[01:37:49.091 --> 01:37:52.813]  And I'd probably be dead right now with the stress I was under, of like the weight thingy.
[01:37:52.953 --> 01:37:55.174]  I just had the guilt that I wasn't able to stop this.
[01:37:55.534 --> 01:37:57.374]  And I have a lot of knowledge about the Globalist.
[01:37:57.394 --> 01:37:58.995]  I've been studying it for 30 plus years.
[01:37:59.375 --> 01:38:05.518]  I can't imagine new people that wake up and then all the disinfo and all the other stuff out there that just get into that so much.
[01:38:05.557 --> 01:38:09.797]   So yeah, you just got to give it to God and realize that if you just wake people up and
[01:38:09.797 --> 01:38:13.717]  just speak up and stand up, that's the right thing to do.
[01:38:13.717 --> 01:38:15.797]  And because you can get too deep into this.
[01:38:15.797 --> 01:38:20.317]   And you can also get to a point, because the world is crazy, if you stare into the abyss,
[01:38:20.317 --> 01:38:24.917]  like Nietzsche said, you can become the abyss.
[01:38:24.917 --> 01:38:29.396]   That then you lose your discernment because you're counting on yourself.
[01:38:29.721 --> 01:38:32.362]  And you just cannot do this yourself.
[01:38:32.822 --> 01:38:35.703]  Even if you're smart and say it all day, it comes down to the Holy Spirit.
[01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:38.224]  And then you study, and then you test things, you look at it.
[01:38:38.524 --> 01:38:39.704]  But just pick the big issues.
[01:38:39.944 --> 01:38:41.905]  We know this shot never worked, it wasn't meant to work.
[01:38:42.085 --> 01:38:43.225]  There's plenty of documents on that.
[01:38:43.525 --> 01:38:46.986]  Warn people about that, or warn people about the big issues.
[01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:51.808]  And then people do get caught up in weird, esoteric stuff that isn't true.
[01:38:51.828 --> 01:38:53.929]  Like, birds really aren't birds, they're robots.
[01:38:54.349 --> 01:38:55.169]  You know, stuff like that.
[01:38:56.339 --> 01:39:02.740]  Yeah, so it's definitely, I mean, it's a great question because it's the big question, but that's why you got to have God.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:03.440]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:03.781 --> 01:39:06.541]  Alex, real quick, I hope you're ready to get your steps in.
[01:39:06.581 --> 01:39:07.661]  I'm going to ask for a picture, man.
[01:39:07.681 --> 01:39:08.581]  I hope you can do it for me.
[01:39:08.621 --> 01:39:09.062]  Sure.
[01:39:09.082 --> 01:39:10.782]  Mr. Rodney wants to say something.
[01:39:11.062 --> 01:39:11.242]  Go ahead.
[01:39:11.262 --> 01:39:14.823]  While he's doing the picture, I was telling Alex about this.
[01:39:14.903 --> 01:39:19.063]  It was probably the year, I think, which was the year, honey, where we rested in London.
[01:39:19.083 --> 01:39:20.884]  We were on holiday with your birthday.
[01:39:21.004 --> 01:39:21.604]  What year was it? 08?
[01:39:22.908 --> 01:39:39.075]   2008 and I remember I was so burdened about America I was so burdened about America and I was on holiday and the Lord spoke to me and he said listen You can't carry the burden.
[01:39:39.495 --> 01:39:39.775]  This is 2008.
[01:39:40.055 --> 01:39:44.078]  He said, you cannot carry the burden about America.
[01:39:44.118 --> 01:39:45.399]  You have to leave it in my hands.
[01:39:45.459 --> 01:39:49.421]  And I still remember, I wrote, we were, I was using WhatsApp at the time.
[01:39:49.801 --> 01:39:53.203]  I wrote to all my staff and I said, today I even put the date.
[01:39:53.864 --> 01:39:57.866]  I give the burden of America to the Lord and I will never carry it again.
[01:39:58.166 --> 01:39:59.567]  And I had a holiday with my wife.
[01:40:00.353 --> 01:40:03.596]  And now there was 2008, here we are in 2023, you know?
[01:40:04.117 --> 01:40:12.786]  So the thing is this, is we'll look again, it'll be 2029, the Lord would have brought us through, either Jesus would have come, or God would have brought us through.
[01:40:13.206 --> 01:40:28.860]   And we'll be talking in 2029 about what the Lord has done, because I believe what you started 30 years ago, 29 years ago, really Has awakened many people, and what we've been doing, it's actually set the enemy back 30 years.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:42.971]  I promise you, they are so far behind right now, and all the people that are old, like, um, Rothschild, well of course he just died, but, but, but, um, Soros and all that, they're so old, and they want to see it happen in their lifetime.
[01:40:42.991 --> 01:40:43.592]  And they say that!
[01:40:43.692 --> 01:40:44.112]  They say that!
[01:40:44.493 --> 01:40:47.555]  But they can't, because God's delaying it.
[01:40:47.615 --> 01:40:56.729]   They will go to a lost eternity, if Jesus doesn't save them, but save them, Yeah, I mean, I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:40:56.930 --> 01:41:01.611]  Well, give us, write us a note or tell us when you get it to the thing.
[01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:07.591]  He's fighting for Jesus. He has to carry out the Pichon Avent.
[01:41:07.591 --> 01:41:10.451]  Ariel Cohen O'Rourke, I beg you guys to interview him.
[01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:11.451]  Ariel Cohen O'Rourke.
[01:41:11.451 --> 01:41:13.451]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:15.451]   Well, give us, write us a note or tell us when you get him to the thing.
[01:41:15.451 --> 01:41:17.451]  He sounds like another rabbit hole.
[01:41:17.451 --> 01:41:22.451]   He's the best Catalyst in the world. A Rabbi in Jerusalem has been fighting for Jesus.
[01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:24.451]  Yeah, yeah, but he's just one person fighting.
[01:41:24.826 --> 01:41:28.847]  What I'm trying to tell you is that we cannot carry the burden of this.
[01:41:28.867 --> 01:41:30.387]  You have to put it in the hands of the Lord.
[01:41:30.767 --> 01:41:34.548]  And God's the one that each person doing our portion.
[01:41:34.928 --> 01:41:35.928]  You're doing your portion.
[01:41:35.988 --> 01:41:36.808]  I'm doing my portion.
[01:41:37.068 --> 01:41:37.508]  Every one of us.
[01:41:37.528 --> 01:41:37.668]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:37.688 --> 01:41:38.728]  I want to hear from you when you get up here.
[01:41:38.748 --> 01:41:39.569]  So thank you so much.
[01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:40.249]  We'll get to you in a moment.
[01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:41.269]  Ma'am, thanks for waiting.
[01:41:41.289 --> 01:41:41.749]  Go ahead.
[01:41:42.449 --> 01:41:43.849]  Hi, my name is Jessica.
[01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:45.910]  First, I do have beef with you.
[01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:49.771]  I've been following you since I was 10 years old.
[01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:51.912]  It got me to mental institutions.
[01:41:53.133 --> 01:41:57.015]  It got me to lose a lot of friends and a lot of humiliations, but I'm telling you, that's God's working.
[01:41:57.995 --> 01:42:01.377]  I'm a survivor of sexual human trafficking as a child.
[01:42:02.097 --> 01:42:09.041]  And I just want to tell you that there's a huge, I agree with you, there's a huge conditioning going over the youth.
[01:42:09.853 --> 01:42:13.514]  To keep them silenced, whether it is through drugs, through humiliations, through bullying.
[01:42:14.134 --> 01:42:14.774]  And it's enough.
[01:42:15.454 --> 01:42:15.914]  It's enough.
[01:42:16.174 --> 01:42:17.895]  And I just want to tell you, I love your seal.
[01:42:18.675 --> 01:42:19.815]  I think you should keep preaching.
[01:42:20.095 --> 01:42:23.896]  The only true source right now, you are one of those.
[01:42:25.176 --> 01:42:26.696]  There's no other way to look anymore.
[01:42:26.896 --> 01:42:27.596]  It's the Bible.
[01:42:28.737 --> 01:42:30.237]  And it's the people that think like us.
[01:42:30.297 --> 01:42:30.877]  And that's it.
[01:42:31.077 --> 01:42:31.677]  We're alone.
[01:42:31.977 --> 01:42:32.617]  We're alone.
[01:42:33.177 --> 01:42:34.718]  We're alone when it comes to this world.
[01:42:35.298 --> 01:42:36.518]  Whoever's listening to the world.
[01:42:37.205 --> 01:42:42.875]  But anyway, what I want to say is, I have a question.
[01:42:43.656 --> 01:42:45.540]  What would you think would come first?
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.082]  Civil War or World War III?
[01:42:49.238 --> 01:42:52.800]  I mean, I think America's in a cultural, spiritual civil war right now.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:43:01.924]  The left's trying to bully us and take our children from us and do what happened to you to everybody and really try to hurt God's children.
[01:43:01.964 --> 01:43:04.085]  So I think the civil war has already come.
[01:43:04.146 --> 01:43:05.826]  Russia's in a type of civil war.
[01:43:05.886 --> 01:43:10.449]  I mean, this is the decline of civilization because we turned our back on God.
[01:43:10.489 --> 01:43:12.029]  I think it's a long process.
[01:43:12.069 --> 01:43:12.570]  I think both.
[01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:14.471]  I think all of it comes together at the same time.
[01:43:14.491 --> 01:43:15.071]  Pastor, what do you think?
[01:43:15.151 --> 01:43:17.853]  No, I don't think it's a civil war like a North and South.
[01:43:18.353 --> 01:43:19.994]  It's a dividing of people.
[01:43:20.474 --> 01:43:25.337]  You there, black, white, Spanish, German, Dutch, French, American, okay?
[01:43:25.617 --> 01:43:33.422]  And then all the different churches dividing, he's the problem, oh they're speaking tongues, they're happy clappers, we will not, they believe in prosperity.
[01:43:33.662 --> 01:43:36.444]  It's all this divide and conquer thing that's taking place.
[01:43:36.824 --> 01:43:44.089]  So that's a civil war in a sense, and especially when you're being censored and being de-platformed and all that kind of stuff.
[01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:45.170]  We're already seeing it.
[01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:53.236]  It's almost like what happened in the Middle East with the Arab Spring is now taking place in America right before our eyes.
[01:43:53.516 --> 01:43:54.557]  And that's what Al Gore said.
[01:43:54.597 --> 01:43:55.858]  He said we need an Arab Spring.
[01:43:56.298 --> 01:44:07.907]   And in the WikiLeaks, Hillary goes, everybody hates us, nobody believes in the system in 2015, and this department head of a psychological warfare university said, We have to up the culture war, divide everyone.
[01:44:08.067 --> 01:44:08.608]  It's right there.
[01:44:09.308 --> 01:44:10.029]  So that's all they've got.
[01:44:10.049 --> 01:44:13.652]  It doesn't mean people don't have real beefs with each other, but they're exacerbating it.
[01:44:13.752 --> 01:44:17.435]  If you're leaving, tell the people you're leaving so we can bring people in from the overflow.
[01:44:18.035 --> 01:44:19.416]  Alex, can I take a picture with you?
[01:44:20.017 --> 01:44:20.917]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:44:21.198 --> 01:44:22.158]  Go ahead, next question.
[01:44:22.218 --> 01:44:24.400]  She has a problem with you, but she wants a picture with you.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:33.387]  Hi Alex, really awesome to talk to you.
[01:44:35.536 --> 01:44:48.188]  My question is, I just want to say, I'm a child of communism, born in Russia, Moscow, in the early 80s.
[01:44:49.549 --> 01:45:00.339]  I remember standing in bread lines and egg lines and meat, whatever, and getting rations and coupons for everything.
[01:45:02.068 --> 01:45:03.508]  It's, uh, it's absolute evil.
[01:45:04.389 --> 01:45:10.150]  Um, and, uh, I'm seeing it now happen in this country and it hurts unbelievably.
[01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:19.393]  And it makes me so angry cause, um, my family escaped that and, and now, you know, we're, we're back at it again.
[01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:25.255]  Um, seeing it happen in, in this country and it's still the greatest country in the world.
[01:45:26.275 --> 01:45:28.016]  Um, so.
[01:45:29.195 --> 01:45:34.398]  You know, and my grandfather was imprisoned by Stalin for saying the wrong thing.
[01:45:34.418 --> 01:45:43.263]  So, it just angers me beyond imagination what's going on here now.
[01:45:43.363 --> 01:45:49.486]   My question is, What's, in your opinion, what's our number one weapon?
[01:45:50.086 --> 01:45:54.408]  What's our number one strategy against communism?
[01:45:54.428 --> 01:45:55.728]  Well, you know what that's going to be.
[01:45:55.748 --> 01:46:01.951]  It's asking God or the Holy Ghost to lead God and direct you, but then it's taking action and doing it, and it's not submitting.
[01:46:01.971 --> 01:46:08.473]  There's this meme which shows like four burned matches, and then it shows one below that didn't get burned, and it's like non-compliance.
[01:46:08.794 --> 01:46:10.074]  And then all the other matches don't burn.
[01:46:10.354 --> 01:46:12.235]  You've just got to be the domino that doesn't fall.
[01:46:13.332 --> 01:46:17.554]  Look at Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the great writer and, you know, mind of Russia.
[01:46:17.855 --> 01:46:19.776]  And I've read his Gulag or Pelago and several other books.
[01:46:20.156 --> 01:46:21.617]  It'll give you a headache because it's so well written.
[01:46:21.637 --> 01:46:24.818]  Each paragraph is like a genius, multidimensional meaning.
[01:46:24.918 --> 01:46:25.939]  One of the greatest writers ever.
[01:46:26.219 --> 01:46:28.080]  But he said, oh, how we burn in the camps later.
[01:46:28.994 --> 01:46:40.104]  Wishing in places like Leningrad, when the GRU came to arrest up to a quarter of the city and put them in slave camps, if we'd have just stood up, none of it would have happened.
[01:46:40.824 --> 01:46:42.125]  But they didn't even have guns.
[01:46:42.165 --> 01:46:44.888]  We said we had like hatchets and pokers and daggers and waited for them.
[01:46:45.268 --> 01:46:47.069]  The organs of the system would have ground to a halt.
[01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:48.911]  And so that's really what comes out of it.
[01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:53.710]   We need to fix it with information war and the truth now before they put all their little
[01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:55.710]  communists in their controllers.
[01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:59.670]   And then if we fail in that, they're taking us to FEMA camps and quote people die because
[01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:01.550]  they got to give you the shot and oh where'd Bob go.
[01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:05.070]   I mean we were going to have to physically stand up for ourselves at that level.
[01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:08.370]   And I'm not calling for any offensive stuff because they'll spend that in the block of
[01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:09.370]  tourists.
[01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:13.469]   But we do have to understand if we don't work now really hard to expose this peacefully.
[01:47:13.288 --> 01:47:18.568]   when that's the information is 90% of war. We're in a war and the Pentagon will tell you,
[01:47:18.568 --> 01:47:22.727]   and I remember the 90% of war is information. If we don't use that, we'll never win physically.
[01:47:22.727 --> 01:47:27.448]   We will fix this by not submitting. It doesn't mean we don't do civil disobedience. It doesn't
[01:47:27.448 --> 01:47:31.288]   mean we don't get physically attacked. But I mean, look at Martin Luther King getting
[01:47:31.288 --> 01:47:33.928]   beaten and all that for just trying to vote, trying to have freedom.
[01:47:34.169 --> 01:47:39.711]  And if he'd have sat there and shot a bunch of people, he would have lost that by being beat up and being Christ-like.
[01:47:40.051 --> 01:47:41.372]  Then that's what defeated the system.
[01:47:41.692 --> 01:47:44.492]  So I'm not... Sometimes, like Christ did, you gotta have times where you're peaceful.
[01:47:44.853 --> 01:47:47.333]  And other times, he said, go out now and sell your coat and buy a sword.
[01:47:47.673 --> 01:47:50.574]  But when they're trying to take you to FEMA camps and stuff, you gotta defend yourself.
[01:47:50.874 --> 01:47:52.675]  So people, you know, we're very close to that.
[01:47:53.235 --> 01:47:54.617]  When do we exercise our Second Amendment?
[01:47:54.657 --> 01:47:57.199]  Because it's not for recreation, it's not for fun.
[01:47:57.079 --> 01:48:00.079]  so that you don't have to, you know, use the sword.
[01:48:00.079 --> 01:48:02.079]  When do we exercise our Second Amendment?
[01:48:02.079 --> 01:48:06.079]  Because it's not for recreation, it's not for fun.
[01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:08.079]  Hang on, Army Trust.
[01:48:08.079 --> 01:48:14.079]   Here's the problem. The moment you start to talk that way, then you just paint a target on yourself,
[01:48:14.079 --> 01:48:18.079]  because then you're a right-wing terrorist, basically.
[01:48:18.347 --> 01:48:19.408]  That's what they're looking for.
[01:48:19.508 --> 01:48:24.571]  And we've just moved it out of the realm of information war and speaking and loving each other and telling the truth.
[01:48:24.852 --> 01:48:28.914]  Look how we beat Fauci and Bill Gates in information despite all their censorship and control.
[01:48:29.475 --> 01:48:31.816]  We didn't do it by going to Fauci's house and attacking him.
[01:48:31.977 --> 01:48:32.977]  That turned him into a victim.
[01:48:33.157 --> 01:48:35.199]  We don't want to be offensively violent.
[01:48:35.359 --> 01:48:36.680]  We're winning with the truth.
[01:48:41.152 --> 01:48:48.796]  The Second Amendment is to protect your home, but it's not to do an uprising and overthrow a government because you don't have the weaponry to do that.
[01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:49.436]  You're just stupid.
[01:48:49.596 --> 01:48:51.738]  Basically, you're committing suicide.
[01:48:52.018 --> 01:48:53.098]  Basically, that's what it is.
[01:48:53.539 --> 01:48:59.602]  So, by the power of the Holy Spirit, with the Word of God and the information, we're going to turn the hearts of the people.
[01:48:59.842 --> 01:49:01.863]  People are going to get saved, and we'll flip the switch.
[01:49:01.883 --> 01:49:03.144]  Yeah, what's the military say?
[01:49:03.824 --> 01:49:05.125]  Hearts and minds, hearts and minds.
[01:49:05.165 --> 01:49:06.166]  That's how you win wars.
[01:49:07.086 --> 01:49:09.588]  I'm telling you, 90% of war is hearts and minds, folks.
[01:49:09.968 --> 01:49:12.229]  And if we're not winning the hearts and minds, we're never going to win with a gun.
[01:49:12.490 --> 01:49:14.691]  So, it's a cop-out.
[01:49:14.711 --> 01:49:16.772]  And it's not a cop-out because I'm scared of physical confrontation.
[01:49:17.273 --> 01:49:20.255]  I'm saying, in a last-ditch effort, they're going around putting us all in death camps.
[01:49:20.615 --> 01:49:21.636]  We're going to do what we have to do, okay?
[01:49:21.976 --> 01:49:24.758]  But I'm telling you, you're going to be fighting drones and robots and nerve gas at that point.
[01:49:25.198 --> 01:49:27.599]  If they get that far, folks, you're going to wish you were dead anyways.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.040]  They're not going to get to that point.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:29.441]  Not here.
[01:49:29.701 --> 01:49:31.362]  Maybe in China, maybe other places.
[01:49:31.582 --> 01:49:31.962]  Not here!
[01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:34.564]  Go ahead, brother.
[01:49:36.061 --> 01:49:37.082]  I like that shirt, though.
[01:49:37.102 --> 01:49:39.264]  Grand Juries indict Fauci for gain of function.
[01:49:39.524 --> 01:49:40.685]  Arrest Fauci and Gates!
[01:49:40.985 --> 01:49:41.826]  Through the system!
[01:49:42.046 --> 01:49:42.507]  Triumph!
[01:49:44.989 --> 01:49:45.329]  Hello.
[01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:49.793]  I just want to say what an honor it is to finally meet the great Bill Hicks.
[01:49:50.734 --> 01:49:51.254]  Very funny.
[01:49:52.315 --> 01:49:53.736]  Man, Bill Hicks was better looking than me.
[01:49:53.756 --> 01:49:55.318]  That's this weird thing around Bill Hicks.
[01:49:56.038 --> 01:49:58.140]  I think Bill Hicks would be like 65 years old.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.262]  I mean, I don't look like I'm 55, and I'm not 65.
[01:50:02.679 --> 01:50:04.060]  Glad everyone understands.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:07.421]  Alright, I just have a couple questions and a request.
[01:50:08.622 --> 01:50:19.646]  So myself and my friend here, Alexander, we were in D.C.
[01:50:19.926 --> 01:50:20.847]  in November.
[01:50:20.907 --> 01:50:29.510]  This was before the whole January 6th debacle to, you know, show our support for Trump.
[01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:35.330]   So at the time, I thought Trump was the man for the job.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:45.942]  And despite the highly questionable results of that election, I've since changed my opinion.
[01:50:46.682 --> 01:50:50.483]  And my questions are, I'm wondering if you still think he's the right man for the job.
[01:50:50.543 --> 01:51:03.486]  And one of the primary reasons I've changed my opinion is because he has not withdrawn his support for the dangerous experimental vaccine.
[01:51:04.347 --> 01:51:09.313]   And ultimately, He did not listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:51:09.794 --> 01:51:14.623]  to create a Vaccine Safety Commission, and ultimately he listened to Bill Gates.
[01:51:14.643 --> 01:51:16.447]  Can I say something about that?
[01:51:17.375 --> 01:51:31.463]  What people don't know about the Trump administration is there were so many people around him that were blocking him, and there were lawyers that were shutting everything down, that even though people spoke, they came right in behind and locked him down.
[01:51:31.523 --> 01:51:32.403]  He could not move.
[01:51:32.864 --> 01:51:37.006]  I know more about the inner workings of the Trump administration because I've been up there.
[01:51:37.026 --> 01:51:38.027]  I was in the White House.
[01:51:38.467 --> 01:51:39.287]  I saw what they were doing.
[01:51:39.327 --> 01:51:44.269]   There were people Working behind the scenes to pull the wheels off of whatever he would want to.
[01:51:44.289 --> 01:51:48.751]  He's the one that, you know, Polo White, who's like one of his main advisors, they hang out constantly.
[01:51:49.511 --> 01:51:52.112]  He got her involved in her evangelical mission right here at this church.
[01:51:52.572 --> 01:51:53.752]  He knows all the inside baseball.
[01:51:54.013 --> 01:51:55.373]  Let me give you the answer on Trump.
[01:51:55.733 --> 01:51:57.554]  You have to decide whether to support Trump or not.
[01:51:57.594 --> 01:51:58.234]  And let me explain.
[01:51:58.554 --> 01:52:00.015]  I've been mad at him about the poison shot.
[01:52:00.475 --> 01:52:01.235]  He's pig-headed.
[01:52:01.595 --> 01:52:02.596]  He never admits he's wrong.
[01:52:03.376 --> 01:52:06.137]  But it's the same reason they can't tell him what to do is he's pig-headed with them.
[01:52:06.157 --> 01:52:06.677]  That's why they hate him.
[01:52:07.279 --> 01:52:08.559]  He will not admit he's wrong.
[01:52:08.619 --> 01:52:09.640]  I think he knows he's wrong.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.400]  He thinks he'll be attacked if he admits he's wrong.
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:14.121]  But now he said, don't give it to kids, don't make the military take it.
[01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:16.301]  You know, he's never said you should be made to take it.
[01:52:16.822 --> 01:52:19.142]  And so, I'm not giving him a pass on that.
[01:52:19.502 --> 01:52:21.323]  The issue is, he won the election.
[01:52:21.903 --> 01:52:24.223]  They indicted him so you can't vote for him.
[01:52:25.224 --> 01:52:28.264]  That's why I'm supporting him, because I'll be attacked for supporting him.
[01:52:28.525 --> 01:52:29.425]  I'm not going to be a coward.
[01:52:29.705 --> 01:52:44.065]   And look, Every time I support him, I criticize him for the shots, but I am not going to vote for Gavin Newsom, or Big Mike, or any of these people, or Mike Pence, or Chris Christie, or any of them.
[01:52:44.105 --> 01:52:44.605]  I mean, that's it.
[01:52:44.825 --> 01:52:46.646]  That's your decision you've got to make.
[01:52:46.706 --> 01:52:47.846]  Let's get to the next guy.
[01:52:47.906 --> 01:52:48.227]  Over here.
[01:52:48.927 --> 01:52:49.327]  Thank you, sir.
[01:52:49.347 --> 01:52:49.607]  Go ahead.
[01:52:51.744 --> 01:52:52.485]  Hi Alex.
[01:52:52.545 --> 01:52:53.165]  Hi Pastor.
[01:52:53.225 --> 01:52:55.027]  Thank you very much for hosting this tonight.
[01:52:55.147 --> 01:52:56.068]  It's a wonderful event.
[01:52:56.609 --> 01:53:03.775]  Alex, I've been listening to you reluctantly since about 2005, and I say reluctantly because I was one of those pro-American hawks.
[01:53:04.196 --> 01:53:10.982]  I've always believed in America, and everything that America's done, it's painful for me to see what we've become.
[01:53:15.161 --> 01:53:22.569]  I've come to embrace what you say and the only way we can fix it is to know what our past was and to go rightfully forward.
[01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:27.314]  That being said, we've escaped because of you.
[01:53:27.615 --> 01:53:28.476]  I knew what they were going to do.
[01:53:29.036 --> 01:53:31.459]  Because once you understand the plan, you can predict every move.
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:34.443]  I was an FDNY paramedic for 18 years.
[01:53:34.843 --> 01:53:36.546]  I had 7 years to go to full retirement.
[01:53:36.946 --> 01:53:40.290]  I told everybody what was coming, and I worked in FDNY headquarters.
[01:53:40.671 --> 01:53:42.753]  I watched 12 doctors turn on a dime.
[01:53:43.114 --> 01:53:44.496]  I was like, none of you are scientists.
[01:53:44.696 --> 01:53:45.697]  You guys are globalists.
[01:53:46.077 --> 01:53:47.479]  I fought with him every single day.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.100]  We saved our money.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:52.242]  I told my girlfriend, you have the furniture budget.
[01:53:52.542 --> 01:53:54.423]  I have the move in the Second Amendment budget.
[01:53:54.703 --> 01:53:57.004]  Because when it's time to pull the trigger, we're going to pull the trigger.
[01:53:57.604 --> 01:54:02.326]  One of my friends who turned me on to all this stuff years ago, I said, there can't be this many pedophiles in the world.
[01:54:02.706 --> 01:54:05.247]  There can't be this many anti-Americans in America.
[01:54:05.807 --> 01:54:06.568]  We fought about it.
[01:54:07.288 --> 01:54:09.969]  I came to you reluctantly, you changed my mind.
[01:54:10.349 --> 01:54:17.872]  I've come to realize that changing your mind is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of intelligence when better material is presented.
[01:54:18.232 --> 01:54:21.993]  You consider the material and you change your mind based on the best knowledge that you have.
[01:54:22.653 --> 01:54:26.334]  So anybody, and another thing I would say is, you never know who's listening.
[01:54:26.774 --> 01:54:27.535]  Stand strong.
[01:54:28.255 --> 01:54:34.297]   People that I thought were not listening when I was trying to change my life, Came or I got screenshots sent to me.
[01:54:34.397 --> 01:54:36.038]  I left and quit in one day.
[01:54:36.618 --> 01:54:38.599]  Quit and two weeks later was down here in Florida.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:42.321]  And I had screenshots sent to me from people who's not on Facebook anymore.
[01:54:42.941 --> 01:54:43.842]  My nickname is Fitz.
[01:54:44.402 --> 01:54:46.783]  And they were like, I can't believe that Fitz was right.
[01:54:47.284 --> 01:54:50.045]  But thanks to him, I don't live paycheck to paycheck anymore.
[01:54:50.405 --> 01:54:52.266]  And I had food in my house when the pandemic hit.
[01:54:52.786 --> 01:54:54.607]  These were people who were fighting me on everything.
[01:54:54.647 --> 01:54:55.688]  I was like, no one's listening.
[01:54:56.545 --> 01:54:57.847]  It's just it's just amazing.
[01:54:57.887 --> 01:54:58.748]  Exactly.
[01:54:58.788 --> 01:55:00.470]  They don't always tell you you're right up front.
[01:55:00.690 --> 01:55:03.314]  You plant the seed and you just move on to the next person.
[01:55:03.574 --> 01:55:10.403]  And another thing that I've come to come to realize is when somebody says conspiracy theorist, I've learned to turn it around.
[01:55:10.825 --> 01:55:15.946]  I may be a conspiracy theorist, but you're a coincidence theorist, because you think that these things happen by coincidence.
[01:55:16.246 --> 01:55:20.127]  How is it that every single thing they do furthers their agenda?
[01:55:20.467 --> 01:55:24.448]  It would be at least a coin flip if it were a coincidence.
[01:55:24.908 --> 01:55:27.128]  At least something would come out that's good for the American people.
[01:55:27.488 --> 01:55:28.569]  Everything's anti-American.
[01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:29.529]  They're at war with us!
[01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:34.090]  And you can study all the documents, how they war game, the whole rollout, it's all pre-programmed.
[01:55:34.150 --> 01:55:34.870]  It's just what I'm saying.
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:36.510]  The intelligence is all public.
[01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:37.591]  It's all there how they did it.
[01:55:37.851 --> 01:55:38.611]  God bless you, brother.
[01:55:39.191 --> 01:55:39.791]  Thank you so much.
[01:55:42.367 --> 01:55:43.729]  Another Arrest Fauci.
[01:55:43.769 --> 01:55:45.291]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:55:45.351 --> 01:55:45.691]  Go ahead.
[01:55:45.991 --> 01:55:46.812]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:55:46.932 --> 01:55:47.833]  I'm very excited.
[01:55:47.873 --> 01:55:49.415]  My heart's literally beating out of my chest.
[01:55:49.495 --> 01:55:51.277]  I tune into your show all the time.
[01:55:51.297 --> 01:55:53.320]  I have all of your products, your shirts.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:53.880]  Beautiful.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:54.922]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:55:55.786 --> 01:55:56.186]  Of course.
[01:55:56.246 --> 01:55:57.107]  No, I really do.
[01:55:58.167 --> 01:56:06.992]  With that said, during the Stop the Steal election when we went to Tallahassee to protest with Owen Schroer, I got to meet him, get a picture with him, and I ended up giving him a gift.
[01:56:07.312 --> 01:56:11.995]  And today I came and brought you a gift for how much you've influenced my life and I felt it was only right.
[01:56:12.295 --> 01:56:26.040]   So I would love to give it to you and During the protests in D.C., your security team wouldn't let me get close enough for you to sign my constitution, and rightfully so, but I was hoping that I could do that and then get a picture with me and my buddy.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:45.920]  Sure, let's do it.
[01:56:45.761 --> 01:56:46.761]  We'll bring them in.
[01:56:46.761 --> 01:57:02.320]   We're going to go about another 20 minutes, so nobody else in the lines, if you've been
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  up...
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:04.681]  I'm going to go fast because you guys are awesome.
[01:57:04.708 --> 01:57:05.369]  I appreciate being here.
[01:57:05.389 --> 01:57:06.469]  I know it's 5am.
[01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:09.030]  I'm going to fall asleep when they arrive at the hotel.
[01:57:09.911 --> 01:57:10.491]  This is fun.
[01:57:11.837 --> 01:57:12.697]  Hey, my name's Jim.
[01:57:12.777 --> 01:57:13.418]  I'm from Georgia.
[01:57:13.498 --> 01:57:15.179]  I just wanted to say I love both you guys.
[01:57:15.419 --> 01:57:18.400]  I was here for the first day of the stand, and that's great, and you're awesome.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.602]  And I want to get a picture with both y'all after I finish.
[01:57:23.022 --> 01:57:25.784]  But also, I got one other thing.
[01:57:25.604 --> 01:57:28.804]  When are you going to have Tom Lapley do a fourth hour?
[01:57:28.804 --> 01:57:30.804]  Yeah, we should have Tom Lapley.
[01:57:30.804 --> 01:57:32.804]  I've seen his stuff before.
[01:57:32.804 --> 01:57:34.804]  I like him.
[01:57:34.804 --> 01:57:40.804]   And also, my thought was, what would you think if all this stuff they're trying to do
[01:57:40.804 --> 01:57:45.604]   to stop Trump, at say 11th hour, December or something of 2024,
[01:57:45.604 --> 01:57:49.604]  they say, "Oh, well we figured out you did win the election."
[01:57:49.412 --> 01:57:50.833]  And so that was your term.
[01:57:51.433 --> 01:57:53.573]  And well, you know, we can't let you.
[01:57:53.673 --> 01:57:55.494]  I don't think they'll do that to admit they're wrong.
[01:57:56.283 --> 01:57:59.268]  Yeah, because, I mean, it's all a mess.
[01:57:59.669 --> 01:58:02.113]  I think they could blow his airplane up, they could release a new virus.
[01:58:02.173 --> 01:58:05.599]  I mean, they need to be so fully exposed to this credit that they give up.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.162]  And that's happening.
[01:58:07.202 --> 01:58:08.083]  I mean, like...
[01:58:08.957 --> 01:58:11.619]  Their press secretaries are all walking off the podium, they're just collapsing.
[01:58:12.219 --> 01:58:12.960]  God bless you, brother.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:13.820]  God bless you, man.
[01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:15.742]  We're gonna move quick so we can get to everybody here.
[01:58:16.002 --> 01:58:17.122]  Come on up, get a picture, let's do it.
[01:58:17.463 --> 01:58:18.844]  Go ahead, beautiful, how you doing?
[01:58:19.484 --> 01:58:22.386]  Oh, Alex, I would like to say, may I hold it, please?
[01:58:22.866 --> 01:58:24.127]  No, we hold it, yeah.
[01:58:24.147 --> 01:58:24.988]  Okay, you hold it.
[01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:32.773]  We've learned to keep the microphone.
[01:58:36.755 --> 01:58:37.616]  Well, he's taking a picture.
[01:58:38.407 --> 01:58:41.886]  I got a multitasker.
[01:58:41.886 --> 01:58:45.646]  I would just like to say he was talking of it.
[01:58:45.646 --> 01:58:49.567]  I would like to say to you, Alex, up close and personal.
[01:58:49.567 --> 01:59:00.926]  You're a magnificently glorious man.
[01:59:00.926 --> 01:59:21.047]  And I'm going to be honest, I'm not going to lie.
[01:59:21.131 --> 01:59:23.753]  Okay, I don't have a question, Alex.
[01:59:23.793 --> 01:59:31.339]  I'm here to bring forth the divine energy and power that we all... No, we're not going to do that right now.
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:33.281]  No, we're not going to do that right now.
[01:59:34.741 --> 01:59:36.002]  Yeah, we're not doing that right now.
[01:59:36.602 --> 01:59:37.983]  Okay, this is only for boyfriends.
[01:59:38.043 --> 01:59:39.264]  Make sure you... We love you, though.
[01:59:39.284 --> 01:59:39.524]  Thank you.
[01:59:39.544 --> 01:59:40.105]  We're gonna move quick.
[01:59:40.125 --> 01:59:40.305]  Thank you.
[01:59:40.325 --> 01:59:40.625]  Love you.
[01:59:40.645 --> 01:59:40.825]  Come.
[01:59:41.346 --> 01:59:41.686]  Go ahead.
[01:59:41.706 --> 01:59:41.866]  Hello.
[01:59:42.526 --> 01:59:43.507]  Hello, my name's Isaiah.
[01:59:44.488 --> 01:59:47.290]  Uh, I've been watching you for like... Speak up a little bit.
[01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:47.510]  Sorry.
[01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:47.810]  Go ahead.
[01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:49.211]  My name's Isaiah.
[01:59:49.751 --> 01:59:51.152]  I've been watching you for a little bit.
[01:59:51.412 --> 01:59:56.696]  Not too long, because I haven't lived that long, but... Um, and I just want to say, I really like your beard.
[01:59:57.236 --> 01:59:57.897]  You have a nice beard.
[02:00:00.094 --> 02:00:00.694]  What do you use?
[02:00:01.474 --> 02:00:01.775]  Nothing.
[02:00:01.935 --> 02:00:02.975]  Because I'm getting there, you know?
[02:00:03.435 --> 02:00:06.156]  I just cut, I just, uh, I get like my hair cut once a month.
[02:00:06.816 --> 02:00:09.697]  I know, isn't that, I look like a little egg, a little bit of fuzz on the top too.
[02:00:09.717 --> 02:00:12.938]  My wife's like, it's time for you to shave it off and give up the ghost.
[02:00:13.578 --> 02:00:15.499]  So I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'll be bald head soon.
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.561]  Alright, God bless you, sir.
[02:00:18.021 --> 02:00:18.721]  Is that it?
[02:00:18.781 --> 02:00:20.643]  A little bit of... I just have a quick question.
[02:00:21.043 --> 02:00:23.044]  So I know you infiltrated Bohemian Grove.
[02:00:23.104 --> 02:00:23.924]  How'd you go about that?
[02:00:23.964 --> 02:00:24.665]  Like, how'd you do it?
[02:00:25.085 --> 02:00:26.506]  Well, I made a couple documentaries about it.
[02:00:26.526 --> 02:00:27.246]  They're free online.
[02:00:27.266 --> 02:00:28.847]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:00:28.987 --> 02:00:29.848]  You can watch them for free.
[02:00:29.968 --> 02:00:30.728]  It's a long story.
[02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:32.770]  But, uh... Alright, thank you, sir.
[02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:33.310]  God bless you.
[02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:34.070]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:00:34.130 --> 02:00:36.132]  Alex uses the pill Beard Force.
[02:00:36.512 --> 02:00:37.152]  Anyway, carry on.
[02:00:37.172 --> 02:00:38.293]  That's right.
[02:00:39.219 --> 02:00:42.601]  I just have a little testimony and maybe a question.
[02:00:43.442 --> 02:00:48.105]  In 1976 I was in the Navy in boot camp and they gave me the swine flu shot.
[02:00:49.352 --> 02:00:50.753]  Yeah, and I had a stroke.
[02:00:51.994 --> 02:00:54.815]  And nobody talked about that for years and years.
[02:00:55.276 --> 02:01:00.699]  Start that over, because on record they pulled the swine flu shot, it killed a bunch of people, but much less than the new shot.
[02:01:01.139 --> 02:01:04.681]  And of course they gave it to the military, and this was a big deal, so start over.
[02:01:04.701 --> 02:01:06.702]  Yeah, I wasn't allowed to talk about this either.
[02:01:06.822 --> 02:01:09.444]  Yeah, you were in the Navy, they gave you a swine flu, you had a stroke.
[02:01:09.584 --> 02:01:13.967]  There were 80 of us in the company, and only 39 of us made it.
[02:01:16.892 --> 02:01:17.132]  Wow.
[02:01:17.212 --> 02:01:22.894]  That's not out there anywhere, and I'm afraid that's going to... Well, let me tell you something.
[02:01:22.914 --> 02:01:45.549]   I was at Fort Sam Houston when they were doing a bunch of secret military operations, like in 1999, and I was talking to sources, and I talked to the medics there, it's a medical facility, and they said, just a couple years ago here, they brought in privates, and they gave them all an experimental shot, and I don't remember the exact number.
[02:01:45.569 --> 02:01:48.050]  I think they said there was like 20 of them and like 18 died.
[02:01:48.651 --> 02:01:56.994]  And that was a government test to see, and it's all to test, because the people giving the shots don't know, and then they all die, and the government does a test to see, does this group cover it up?
[02:01:57.054 --> 02:01:58.654]  It's all the exercise of raw power.
[02:01:58.974 --> 02:02:00.235]  So you think the military is going to save you?
[02:02:00.475 --> 02:02:06.317]  The people running our military gave experimental squalene that they knew would cause autoimmune disorders in the first Cold War.
[02:02:06.737 --> 02:02:10.119]  They gave experimental anthrax they knew killed, the government admits, 30,000 troops.
[02:02:11.799 --> 02:02:16.160]  30,000 troops were killed by the smallpox, by the anthrax shot.
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:17.601]  Looked that up, so wow.
[02:02:17.821 --> 02:02:18.721]  So it killed a bunch of your guys.
[02:02:18.741 --> 02:02:24.183]  We were so compartmentalized that I don't know what happened to them.
[02:02:24.843 --> 02:02:27.844]  I know what happened to me, and I didn't see them again.
[02:02:28.324 --> 02:02:29.244]  They were just gone.
[02:02:30.064 --> 02:02:31.925]  So I cannot prove one way or the other.
[02:02:31.945 --> 02:02:35.326]  Yeah, because what they do to the military is they really test the bad stuff.
[02:02:35.666 --> 02:02:37.726]  That's why, folks, it's really bad.
[02:02:38.267 --> 02:02:38.747]  God bless you, sir.
[02:02:38.787 --> 02:02:39.487]  I'm sorry that happened to you.
[02:02:40.796 --> 02:02:41.156]  Thank you.
[02:02:41.196 --> 02:02:42.537]  Yes, we're not playing around with these people.
[02:02:43.198 --> 02:02:47.181]  Mr. Jones, first and foremost, I would just like to thank you for taking the time to come out here and pastor.
[02:02:47.281 --> 02:02:52.046]  Thank you for having the courage to host someone like Mr. Jones, who's been ostracized and canceled across the internet.
[02:02:52.486 --> 02:02:53.066]  My name is Aiden.
[02:02:53.106 --> 02:02:55.589]  I'm 15 years old, or excuse me, I'm 18 years old.
[02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:57.750]  I started watching your content whenever I was 15.
[02:02:58.111 --> 02:02:59.372]  I was turned on by my mother.
[02:03:01.093 --> 02:03:06.714]  And you've just been, you've been absolutely instrumental in developing my understanding of the way that the world works in reality.
[02:03:06.954 --> 02:03:10.975]  I'll try and keep my question as brief and precise and contiguous as possible.
[02:03:11.456 --> 02:03:21.758]  As of recent, I've been studying Eastern European history, and more specifically, in Romania in the late 80s, Nicolae Ceaușescu, he had, there was a couple of riots that he had put down.
[02:03:21.878 --> 02:03:25.119]  The last riot, he had a couple of men come out and he opened fire on them.
[02:03:25.559 --> 02:03:25.859]  Absolutely.
[02:03:25.699 --> 02:03:29.819]   at that point that there was a violent revolution in Romania and he had to flee in a helicopter
[02:03:29.819 --> 02:03:31.899]  and his regime fled with him.
[02:03:31.899 --> 02:03:36.019]   My question to you is, do you see the country moving in a similar direction, not necessarily
[02:03:36.019 --> 02:03:40.859]   violently, but in terms of there being a fast catalyzing event which changes the culture
[02:03:40.859 --> 02:03:41.859]  in this country?
[02:03:41.859 --> 02:03:42.859]  Absolutely.
[02:03:42.859 --> 02:03:46.779]  The globalists fear a Ceausescu type moment against them.
[02:03:46.779 --> 02:03:50.339]   That's why they don't want to be identified as the globalist party, both of the Democrat
[02:03:50.339 --> 02:03:52.538]  Republican leadership, but mainly the Democrats.
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:56.701]  And so that's why they provocateured our January 6th situation.
[02:03:57.061 --> 02:04:01.723]  We walked right into a trap because Trump thought there'd be Secret Service and we thought that they would, but they all stood down.
[02:04:02.203 --> 02:04:05.344]  And the, uh, we now know it's come out in the January 6th investigations.
[02:04:06.044 --> 02:04:07.465]  Congress people have now released the videos.
[02:04:08.285 --> 02:04:09.186]  It was the D.C.
[02:04:09.246 --> 02:04:12.808]  police mainly dressed up attacking and provocateurs and people to follow them in.
[02:04:13.269 --> 02:04:13.849]  So D.C.
[02:04:13.889 --> 02:04:14.590]  police were there.
[02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:17.071]  They sent half the Capitol Police to help the D.C.
[02:04:17.111 --> 02:04:18.052]  police and traffic control.
[02:04:18.632 --> 02:04:22.595]  And so while Trump was still speaking, hundreds of thousands had already gone to the Capitol.
[02:04:23.095 --> 02:04:30.080]  And before Trump even began speaking, the provocateurs began to break in, led by Ray Epps, who told the committee he, quote, orchestrated the attack.
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:35.382]  Uh, and so, uh, that was going to make any movement look bad like that in the future.
[02:04:35.442 --> 02:04:39.063]  But, you know, you do have revolutions where communists get overthrown and things like that.
[02:04:39.703 --> 02:04:43.005]  Uh, but, uh, again, normally those don't go well.
[02:04:43.625 --> 02:04:48.627]  And so it's, you know, and it's very easy for the globalists to, like, stage their own so they can lead it into defeat.
[02:04:49.087 --> 02:04:52.108]  Uh, so that's why I said the main avenue is peaceful awakening.
[02:04:52.408 --> 02:04:54.049]  That's why they want to derail that with violence.
[02:04:54.089 --> 02:04:56.049]  But, I mean, I'm glad you brought up Tchelchesky.
[02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:57.490]  That's a good example of what we were saying earlier.
[02:04:58.168 --> 02:04:58.808]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:04:58.868 --> 02:04:59.669]  I really appreciate it.
[02:04:59.689 --> 02:05:01.450]  Would it be possible to take a quick picture with you?
[02:05:01.690 --> 02:05:02.810]  Sure, come on up here.
[02:05:06.292 --> 02:05:08.333]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:05:08.393 --> 02:05:10.174]  How many want Alex to come back?
[02:05:10.194 --> 02:05:18.638]  So if we do a big event, we can do it in the pavilion, and he'll come back.
[02:05:19.479 --> 02:05:20.519]  How many like that idea?
[02:05:25.262 --> 02:05:27.124]  I brought him here, actually, not to do this.
[02:05:27.184 --> 02:05:28.405]  I brought him here to rest.
[02:05:29.686 --> 02:05:30.307]  He tricked me!
[02:05:31.048 --> 02:05:31.288]  No.
[02:05:31.909 --> 02:05:33.971]  Once again, he goes... You're supposed to be on the beat.
[02:05:33.991 --> 02:05:34.551]  I can't do a sound effect.
[02:05:34.571 --> 02:05:35.132]  I'm going to ask him.
[02:05:35.152 --> 02:05:40.677]  He's like, perhaps we should have you at the service, and then I didn't ask Alex anything.
[02:05:40.497 --> 02:05:47.497]  Just a little... Here, have some more steak.
[02:05:47.497 --> 02:05:57.497]  You know, Alex, I only work 18 hours a day.
[02:05:57.497 --> 02:06:00.497]  (audience laughing)
[02:06:01.257 --> 02:06:02.798]  Hey Alex, I just want to say thank you.
[02:06:04.539 --> 02:06:05.839]  I'm from Lexington, Kentucky.
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:06.540]  God bless you.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.761]  I've listened to you since 2007.
[02:06:10.202 --> 02:06:12.023]  And I woke my sons up.
[02:06:12.363 --> 02:06:12.843]  Great job.
[02:06:13.404 --> 02:06:15.405]  And my family, even though they thought I was crazy.
[02:06:18.157 --> 02:06:18.878]  COVID happened.
[02:06:18.958 --> 02:06:20.620]  It was like, oh my God, he was right.
[02:06:22.442 --> 02:06:24.204]  I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:06:25.526 --> 02:06:28.229]  All we need to do is put the armor of God on.
[02:06:31.092 --> 02:06:31.733]  Make the stand.
[02:06:31.753 --> 02:06:34.697]  When the devil schemes, come close.
[02:06:37.339 --> 02:06:39.560]  I am honored to have this conversation with you.
[02:06:40.161 --> 02:06:43.062]  Can you do the one thing that you do with the animated test?
[02:06:43.302 --> 02:06:44.123]  What's it called?
[02:06:44.143 --> 02:06:50.146]  The animated contest of... I think it's Tom... We should do a lot more contests.
[02:06:50.186 --> 02:06:50.787]  No, no, no.
[02:06:51.367 --> 02:06:52.547]  You used to say it.
[02:06:52.568 --> 02:06:54.188]  I think it's Thomas Jefferson's words.
[02:06:56.029 --> 02:06:57.010]  The animated contest of liberty.
[02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.290]  There we go.
[02:06:58.111 --> 02:06:58.571]  Say it again?
[02:06:58.651 --> 02:07:00.572]  The animated contest of liberty.
[02:07:00.632 --> 02:07:02.453]  Oh, the animated contest of liberty!
[02:07:03.053 --> 02:07:03.454]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:03.494 --> 02:07:04.254]  God bless you, man.
[02:07:05.355 --> 02:07:05.935]  Let's get up here.
[02:07:06.559 --> 02:07:10.460]  Yeah, but the point you bring up, come on up, the point he brings up is really central.
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:14.661]  We can tell people what's going to come, and they're not going to listen until it happens.
[02:07:15.242 --> 02:07:17.982]  But people go, wow, Alex Jones told us 20 years ago it came through just like he said.
[02:07:18.202 --> 02:07:19.683]  The Bible told us 2,000 years ago.
[02:07:19.703 --> 02:07:33.327]  All right, we've got to move quick because I'm cross-eyed.
[02:07:33.973 --> 02:07:35.017]  No, I'm sorry, you're on the air.
[02:07:35.659 --> 02:07:37.827]  Oh, I did it again!
[02:07:37.847 --> 02:07:39.011]  He's on the air, actually, though.
[02:07:39.517 --> 02:07:39.797]  Go ahead.
[02:07:40.317 --> 02:07:46.139]  Alex, it's a pleasure to sit here and speak with you today, and thank you for being the bastion and the voice of freedom.
[02:07:46.599 --> 02:07:51.420]  The only one that's been quite narrowed down, there used to be a few, now there's basically only you.
[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:53.861]  So, thank you for that.
[02:07:54.401 --> 02:08:05.083]  I also wanted to ask you, with the current political situation with respect to the Democratic Party and all of their news that's coming out and the cover-ups that they're doing, who do you think that they're going to put into office?
[02:08:05.364 --> 02:08:07.044]  Big Mike or Newsom?
[02:08:07.424 --> 02:08:09.066]  I see them getting Governor Newsom ready.
[02:08:09.606 --> 02:08:12.429]  It's really crazy to try to put Big Mike in.
[02:08:12.449 --> 02:08:14.171]  I mean, Big Mike, I really do believe, is a man.
[02:08:14.491 --> 02:08:22.038]  We have all the sources, stuff I can't even get into, you know, the Naval Medical Facility, them having to say, yeah, he gets, you know, he gets, he gets...
[02:08:23.752 --> 02:08:24.452]  Prostate exams.
[02:08:24.472 --> 02:08:25.952]  I mean, I'm not just saying this to say it.
[02:08:26.252 --> 02:08:28.073]  Have you seen the videos of Big Mike coming out of Harvard?
[02:08:28.373 --> 02:08:28.753]  Of course.
[02:08:28.793 --> 02:08:34.814]  I mean, it's like all the, I mean, it's like, it's on, like, Obama says Michael and I got married in two different speeches.
[02:08:35.314 --> 02:08:35.454]  Yeah.
[02:08:35.474 --> 02:08:36.954]  I mean, I never called my wife Eric.
[02:08:37.014 --> 02:08:37.614]  She's Erica.
[02:08:37.714 --> 02:08:40.115]  You know, like, me and my wife, Eric.
[02:08:41.895 --> 02:08:44.436]  I mean, it's, but that's all part of throwing it in her face.
[02:08:44.896 --> 02:08:45.436]  Absolutely.
[02:08:46.056 --> 02:08:54.638]   I don't think at the end of the day it even matters whether it's Big Mike or Big Gavin, American Psycho, and there's some I mean, they're all just evil globalist snakes.
[02:08:55.599 --> 02:08:57.179]  And it's the evil people behind them.
[02:08:57.199 --> 02:09:02.062]  But, but yeah, I mean, they are, they're just, I mean, look, they already put a zombie in the White House, can't even talk.
[02:09:03.262 --> 02:09:06.804]  I mean, so, uh, it's, it's, it's really all in God's hands right now.
[02:09:07.425 --> 02:09:08.445]  And they're coming after Trump.
[02:09:09.105 --> 02:09:11.987]  And I mean, even, I didn't like Trump and I like Trump.
[02:09:12.787 --> 02:09:15.329]  They stole the election from him and they're doing it again right now.
[02:09:15.909 --> 02:09:19.051]  So I respect the people's will of Trump.
[02:09:19.091 --> 02:09:19.851]  He should be the president.
[02:09:20.521 --> 02:09:21.542]  I mean, Obama got elected.
[02:09:21.562 --> 02:09:22.723]  I don't like Obama, but he got elected.
[02:09:23.684 --> 02:09:24.785]  But Biden did not get elected.
[02:09:25.045 --> 02:09:25.605]  We all know that.
[02:09:25.625 --> 02:09:27.106]  He couldn't get 20 people at a rally.
[02:09:27.307 --> 02:09:28.207]  He hid in his basement.
[02:09:28.768 --> 02:09:30.509]  So, that's where I stand on that.
[02:09:31.290 --> 02:09:32.191]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:32.211 --> 02:09:32.951]  God bless you, sir.
[02:09:32.971 --> 02:09:33.672]  I appreciate it.
[02:09:34.072 --> 02:09:35.033]  Can I get a picture with you?
[02:09:35.113 --> 02:09:35.613]  Yes, sir!
[02:09:35.614 --> 02:09:44.414]  Thank you.
[02:09:44.421 --> 02:09:45.301]  I make people look good.
[02:09:45.341 --> 02:09:45.962]  I'm so ugly.
[02:09:49.059 --> 02:09:51.941]  This comes from Ariel Cohen Aloro from Jerusalem.
[02:09:53.302 --> 02:10:02.687]  The highest person in Judaism was Rebbe, and Rebbe's disciple was Itzhak Ginzburg, who right now is called the angel within Judaism.
[02:10:03.287 --> 02:10:06.469]  And his direct disciple is Ariel Cohen Aloro.
[02:10:06.749 --> 02:10:09.271]  Ariel Cohen Aloro has a message for all Christians.
[02:10:09.891 --> 02:10:11.592]  We know that Jesus is the Messiah.
[02:10:14.171 --> 02:10:20.797]  But there's only one man on this planet that can prove it with biblical mathematics, and that's me.
[02:10:21.398 --> 02:10:23.119]  Ariel and Allura.
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:25.081]  Ariel and Allura.
[02:10:25.722 --> 02:10:27.123]  Well, we'll definitely try to look it up, brother.
[02:10:27.163 --> 02:10:27.583]  Thank you.
[02:10:29.145 --> 02:10:29.345]  Sure.
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:34.501]  We're in the year 5,873.
[02:10:34.741 --> 02:10:39.562]  So if you go to verse 5,873, it tells you what happens this year.
[02:10:40.122 --> 02:10:43.863]  Go to each successive verse and you will see what we do.
[02:10:44.683 --> 02:10:46.523]  You don't need to use imagination.
[02:10:46.583 --> 02:10:49.864]  For example... So what's the next verse that's going to happen?
[02:10:49.944 --> 02:10:53.665]  Verse for 2025 is, their blood is the pitiless poison of serpents.
[02:10:54.285 --> 02:10:55.065]  That's the vaccine.
[02:10:55.365 --> 02:10:55.525]  Wow!
[02:10:57.190 --> 02:10:59.451]  That's Deuteronomy 32 verse 33.
[02:11:00.171 --> 02:11:08.273]  In any case, it says that this year our rock is stronger than their rock and Ratzinger is fighting with Francis.
[02:11:08.873 --> 02:11:09.193]  Okay?
[02:11:09.833 --> 02:11:14.354]  Every verse has a year and it tells you exactly what will happen.
[02:11:14.654 --> 02:11:19.935]  This gate was revealed in 2021 by the highest rabbis in Israel.
[02:11:20.855 --> 02:11:21.336]  Very interesting.
[02:11:21.376 --> 02:11:21.716]  Thank you.
[02:11:22.836 --> 02:11:23.176]  God bless.
[02:11:24.501 --> 02:11:25.122]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:11:25.502 --> 02:11:26.582]  Alex, I'm John.
[02:11:26.622 --> 02:11:27.223]  I'm from Florida.
[02:11:27.243 --> 02:11:29.224]  I've been listening to you for about 15 years.
[02:11:29.664 --> 02:11:30.265]  Thank you.
[02:11:30.325 --> 02:11:31.085]  Beautiful shirt.
[02:11:31.565 --> 02:11:31.866]  Yeah.
[02:11:32.046 --> 02:11:33.867]  Well, for president of Florida, please.
[02:11:33.927 --> 02:11:34.968]  The free states of Florida.
[02:11:35.028 --> 02:11:36.388]  I would like to be the president of Florida.
[02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:39.931]  You'd be in real trouble then.
[02:11:39.971 --> 02:11:40.471]  Go ahead.
[02:11:40.511 --> 02:11:42.792]  So you answered my question about secession earlier.
[02:11:42.832 --> 02:11:44.213]  I'm pro-secessionists, obviously.
[02:11:44.253 --> 02:11:47.615]  But for you and the pastor, I'm also Catholic.
[02:11:47.654 --> 02:11:52.854]   We have Article 675, which is that the church will undergo a crucifixion.
[02:11:52.854 --> 02:12:00.295]   And the SPLC memo with the FBI against Catholics, and it's crossed my mind in reality that they
[02:12:00.295 --> 02:12:02.614]  will persecute and martyr us.
[02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:07.255]   And we're talking about blood of saints and martyrs and patriots and tyrants.
[02:12:07.255 --> 02:12:10.934]  And so my question is, I mean, I want to win.
[02:12:10.934 --> 02:12:11.934]  I'm not black-billed.
[02:12:11.934 --> 02:12:15.693]  But you guys are acting like you can win this thing.
[02:12:15.693 --> 02:12:18.094]  You're not watching the same game I'm watching.
[02:12:18.227 --> 02:12:21.591]  God's going to build His church on our blood, my blood, your blood.
[02:12:21.711 --> 02:12:24.095]  No, you're not watching the same game we're watching.
[02:12:24.978 --> 02:12:25.438]  No, you're not.
[02:12:25.838 --> 02:12:31.260]  Because, basically, you are talking about a battle that's going to be won in the flesh.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:39.684]  If you go back to the first Great Awakening that caused those first 13 colonies to become one nation under God, it was a great spiritual awakening.
[02:12:40.404 --> 02:12:42.885]  The next Great Awakening ended slavery.
[02:12:43.705 --> 02:12:49.487]  But what we're saying is, obviously, the beast will break war against us and overcome us, but that's Satan winning in the third quarter.
[02:12:49.747 --> 02:12:51.128]  He gets his butt kicked in the fourth.
[02:12:53.522 --> 02:12:54.462]  Yeah, no, I mean, I agree.
[02:12:54.482 --> 02:12:58.823]  A lot of people, when he's saying your soul, I think you're looking at temporal defeat.
[02:12:59.084 --> 02:13:01.504]  But in the spiritual realm, is that what you're saying, Pastor?
[02:13:01.524 --> 02:13:03.985]  No, we've got to bring people into eternity.
[02:13:04.425 --> 02:13:06.846]  Otherwise, it's just killing people.
[02:13:06.886 --> 02:13:08.746]  Revelation Chapter 21 tells us how this ends.
[02:13:08.826 --> 02:13:09.326]  I'm with you.
[02:13:11.847 --> 02:13:14.128]  But I don't want it all on your shoulders, is what I'm saying.
[02:13:14.188 --> 02:13:17.029]  Since I've been listening to you, A.J., you're carrying too much on your shoulders.
[02:13:17.369 --> 02:13:20.329]  I want you to be healthy, not a stroke or blood pressure or anything like that.
[02:13:20.610 --> 02:13:21.590]  Blame me, I hear you.
[02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:23.910]  And I would love to shake your hand if it's possible.
[02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:25.331]  Shake your hand.
[02:13:26.651 --> 02:13:27.251]  Well, God bless you.
[02:13:27.271 --> 02:13:27.812]  Get up here, brother.
[02:13:27.852 --> 02:13:28.732]  He wants you to shake your hand.
[02:13:28.752 --> 02:13:33.813]  I'm warning you, I got, like, big pharma hands, though.
[02:13:33.853 --> 02:13:35.454]  That's okay.
[02:13:35.474 --> 02:13:36.114]  God bless you, son.
[02:13:36.154 --> 02:13:36.754]  God bless you, brother.
[02:13:36.834 --> 02:13:36.934]  Amen.
[02:13:38.715 --> 02:13:39.455]  Thank you, sir.
[02:13:43.408 --> 02:13:45.369]  Let me just say this.
[02:13:46.029 --> 02:13:50.830]  What they would love, what the FBI would love, is for us to start talking violence.
[02:13:52.331 --> 02:13:54.691]  And that's why we cannot allow any of that around here.
[02:13:54.711 --> 02:13:57.132]  Because they'll blow something up and blame it on us tomorrow.
[02:13:57.172 --> 02:13:57.592]  Totally.
[02:13:58.412 --> 02:14:03.734]  You just find some loose cannon and then set it up and it's all we all to blame and whatever.
[02:14:03.774 --> 02:14:07.695]  That's why I tell people the answer is Jesus and we have to come from that angle.
[02:14:09.252 --> 02:14:11.453]  Hi, my name is Shelly.
[02:14:11.493 --> 02:14:14.214]  I'm from Florida, Suffolk, Tampa, everywhere.
[02:14:14.234 --> 02:14:17.935]  And A, I'm a realtor, so when you want to come to Florida, let us know.
[02:14:18.756 --> 02:14:21.096]  Well, no, I mean, Texas has fallen.
[02:14:21.477 --> 02:14:22.977]  All the cities are communist run.
[02:14:23.257 --> 02:14:24.358]  The jurisdictions are weaponized.
[02:14:24.638 --> 02:14:27.479]  So I don't put Texas down saying, Florida's beautiful, nice.
[02:14:27.739 --> 02:14:29.440]  There's a bigger awakening happening here.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:34.462]  And at some point, I've got to move operations out of Austin, where my family's been for, you know, since the start of Texas.
[02:14:34.881 --> 02:14:40.241]   It's just that, and Texans need to know, because outside the blue cities, Texans are good people,
[02:14:40.241 --> 02:14:43.841]  but they're prideful and like anybody, they're arrogant.
[02:14:43.841 --> 02:14:45.240]  This can't happen here.
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:49.121]  California was redder than Texas 40 years ago.
[02:14:49.121 --> 02:14:50.661]  It's a communist hellhole.
[02:14:50.661 --> 02:14:55.341]  So we have to admit that the state is shot up in pieces.
[02:14:55.341 --> 02:14:57.841]   And they can take this state over quick too with election fraud.
[02:14:57.841 --> 02:15:02.161]   Once Democrats get control, the modern Democrats, they never relinquish it.
[02:15:02.161 --> 02:15:03.560]  They are dictators.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.720]  So you can't ever let them in power.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.521]  You have to destroy them politically, culturally.
[02:15:08.521 --> 02:15:10.521]  You must treat them like cancer.
[02:15:10.521 --> 02:15:12.521]  Go ahead.
[02:15:13.053 --> 02:15:15.574]  Thing is, number one, I've been listening to you since 2007.
[02:15:15.614 --> 02:15:18.736]  I got awake and by, you were talking about GMOs and some other stuff.
[02:15:19.236 --> 02:15:20.016]  This is a product of 2007.
[02:15:20.216 --> 02:15:22.277]  He was a two and a half month preemie.
[02:15:22.797 --> 02:15:24.238]  This is just turned 16.
[02:15:24.618 --> 02:15:26.899]  And let me tell you something, your youth are awake.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:28.100]  They are awake.
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:30.841]  These kids are doing this and reading this and reading the Bible.
[02:15:30.901 --> 02:15:31.581]  Beautiful.
[02:15:31.641 --> 02:15:32.382]  They're awake.
[02:15:32.862 --> 02:15:39.265]  So with that, now my question is, um, much with what the other lady was talking about with the mortgage being in the same type of field.
[02:15:40.025 --> 02:15:41.125]  I started noticing something.
[02:15:41.145 --> 02:15:42.266]  I just want your take on it.
[02:15:42.766 --> 02:15:46.307]  These train derailments and all these things that are happening in Palo Alto.
[02:15:46.327 --> 02:15:47.427]  100% infrastructure attacks.
[02:15:47.807 --> 02:15:48.827]  Antifa is burning.
[02:15:49.247 --> 02:15:56.829]  Look, if you look to Canada in the last month, thousands of fires set in the same couple days and hundreds at one time.
[02:15:57.289 --> 02:16:00.050]  And Antifa is derailing trains.
[02:16:00.070 --> 02:16:00.050]  100%.
[02:16:03.611 --> 02:16:06.291]  Look, it's just like Extinction Rebellion, all that.
[02:16:06.351 --> 02:16:08.232]  It's meant to collapse the civilization.
[02:16:09.121 --> 02:16:11.583]  I've got another take on that, and this is what I want your opinion on.
[02:16:12.584 --> 02:16:17.027]  Okay, so all these things are happening over mining areas, old ex-mining areas.
[02:16:17.147 --> 02:16:29.076]  And I've heard something, and I don't know if there's validity to this, but that they've started granting people that own property that have ex-mining, they're going to give them money to put solar farms and all this other stuff on.
[02:16:29.376 --> 02:16:34.360]  And it's kind of odd to me that these areas, that all these trains are derailing, the fires are pushing people out of these areas.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:35.640]  You're totally right.
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:38.902]  Collapsing and years of lockdowns for Main Street is designed for vertical integration.
[02:16:38.922 --> 02:16:41.343]  The billionaires on average double their money during the lockdowns.
[02:16:41.162 --> 02:16:43.802]   are the people that are buying up the rest of the country and I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:16:43.802 --> 02:16:50.441]   Oh, well, you know, you're totally right. Collapsing and years of lockdowns for Main Street
[02:16:50.441 --> 02:16:54.841]   is designed for vertical integration. The billionaires on average double their money
[02:16:54.841 --> 02:16:58.442]   during the lockdowns. So the whole thing is to destroy the common people.
[02:16:58.442 --> 02:17:01.721]  Yeah, no, the country's been usurped.
[02:17:01.919 --> 02:17:02.720]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:04.281]  They're not taking the country, they have it.
[02:17:04.521 --> 02:17:08.104]  But it's one thing, you may steal my car, but I can come get it back from you.
[02:17:08.765 --> 02:17:12.748]  So just because they stole our country doesn't mean we don't take it back.
[02:17:13.388 --> 02:17:14.049]  Thank you so much.
[02:17:14.729 --> 02:17:15.210]  God bless you.
[02:17:16.231 --> 02:17:17.091]  How you doing?
[02:17:17.111 --> 02:17:21.415]  Being around all this anointing, being around Dr. Rodney, are you going to start a church?
[02:17:22.304 --> 02:17:22.544]  No.
[02:17:23.945 --> 02:17:25.985]  Or Holy Ghost Woodstock in Austin.
[02:17:26.005 --> 02:17:28.646]  Joe Rogan has his thing out there.
[02:17:29.026 --> 02:17:32.187]  Would you consider starting something like that out there?
[02:17:32.767 --> 02:17:33.287]  Starting a what?
[02:17:33.307 --> 02:17:36.208]  Because the anointing is going to increase on you as you're here more.
[02:17:37.029 --> 02:17:41.970]  Well, I'm going to promote people like Pastor Rodney and I'm going to cover news and do that.
[02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:44.191]  I don't feel a calling to run for politics.
[02:17:44.671 --> 02:17:46.892]  I don't feel a calling to be a pastor.
[02:17:48.644 --> 02:17:53.485]  Because I would need to actually go train and relearn for four or five years and then do that.
[02:17:53.785 --> 02:17:57.466]  I mean, I think I'm just there to push people towards the church and towards God.
[02:17:57.526 --> 02:18:03.808]  It's like the next time you're on Rogue and the anointing is going to come on you and he's trying to smoke and you're going to like, no, I got this right here.
[02:18:03.828 --> 02:18:05.948]  All right, brother, I appreciate you.
[02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.949]  Go ahead.
[02:18:09.409 --> 02:18:10.069]  Hi, Pastor.
[02:18:10.089 --> 02:18:11.089]  Hi, Alex.
[02:18:11.689 --> 02:18:20.671]   Now, like she said, I'm 16 and I was forced into politics from a young age, like most people my age.
[02:18:21.531 --> 02:18:36.301]  And I just want to state and make sure that it's known that not all of my generation and the generation younger than it are blinded by the media and the lies that are told to us.
[02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:42.665]  So I just want to say that there's most of us, a majority of us that know the truth and we're not blinded.
[02:18:43.203 --> 02:18:46.584]  And, sir, I see you as a defender of the Constitution.
[02:18:46.604 --> 02:18:46.824]  Thank you.
[02:18:46.844 --> 02:18:49.125]  And I was wondering if you wanted to sign mine, sir.
[02:18:49.145 --> 02:18:49.125]  100%.
[02:18:49.325 --> 02:18:50.045]  I'm going to be clear.
[02:18:50.705 --> 02:18:53.506]  Every older generation says, look at the younger one, they're a bunch of morons.
[02:18:54.246 --> 02:18:56.967]  I see a real split in the Gen Z and the millennials.
[02:18:57.387 --> 02:18:59.628]  Either those are totally brainwashed or totally awake.
[02:19:00.128 --> 02:19:01.288]  There's a split.
[02:19:01.668 --> 02:19:03.569]  And it's dramatic with the young people.
[02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:07.614]   And the polls all show Over 70% of young people are against abortion.
[02:19:08.134 --> 02:19:09.075]  30 years ago it was the flip.
[02:19:09.515 --> 02:19:10.975]  And so what he's saying is absolutely true.
[02:19:10.995 --> 02:19:17.318]  Yeah, and give him a scholarship to Ruby University School of Government.
[02:19:17.338 --> 02:19:18.538]  Somebody give him a scholarship.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:22.880]  Seriously.
[02:19:26.949 --> 02:19:27.870]  All right, let's go!
[02:19:27.890 --> 02:19:31.634]  Oh, let's get ready to rumble!
[02:19:31.654 --> 02:19:33.316]  Hello, Alex!
[02:19:33.376 --> 02:19:34.598]  Welcome to Tampa!
[02:19:34.678 --> 02:19:35.078]  Welcome.
[02:19:35.599 --> 02:19:37.842]  Anyway, I'm Louise from Boston.
[02:19:38.382 --> 02:19:39.463]  Louise, actually.
[02:19:39.664 --> 02:19:40.024]  Welcome.
[02:19:40.164 --> 02:19:43.909]  And I haven't been able to talk to you for like over 10 years on the phone.
[02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:48.431]  And before I walk back to my seat, I hope I get to shake your hand.
[02:19:48.952 --> 02:19:54.415]  But I did want to ask you, are you familiar with HisAdvocates.org?
[02:19:54.815 --> 02:20:01.959]  Because we've been talking a lot about what's the solution to what to do to get out of this quagmire that we're in the middle of.
[02:20:02.659 --> 02:20:15.108]   And maybe if we're not able to move forward with, and forgive me if I don't use the correct definition of words, if we don't Or if we're not able to pull out of the existing de facto government.
[02:20:15.729 --> 02:20:24.979]  Maybe individually we need to pull out and use the process that this guy, Kelby, is using already?
[02:20:24.999 --> 02:20:26.580]  I'm not familiar with that.
[02:20:27.701 --> 02:20:30.382]  I know there's a lot of alternative systems and people pulling out of the system.
[02:20:30.862 --> 02:20:36.644]  The best way is to get with people you trust and just, you know, having a farm and still working in town to make money, whatever you got to do.
[02:20:37.084 --> 02:20:38.045]  Get self-sufficient.
[02:20:38.385 --> 02:20:43.647]  But I know there's a lot of programs out there of, you know, people sitting there extricating, some real, some not.
[02:20:43.947 --> 02:20:46.167]  So I don't know about the particular program, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:20:47.448 --> 02:20:50.429]  Well, I just want you to consider looking at his website.
[02:20:50.449 --> 02:20:52.209]  Sure, what's it called?
[02:20:52.229 --> 02:20:53.350]  Hisadvocates.org.
[02:20:53.550 --> 02:20:54.210]  I'll look it up.
[02:20:54.350 --> 02:20:54.670]  Yeah.
[02:20:54.810 --> 02:20:55.771]  May I come up and shake your hand?
[02:20:56.071 --> 02:20:56.551]  Yes, please.
[02:20:59.178 --> 02:21:00.038]  God bless you guys.
[02:21:00.599 --> 02:21:01.219]  This is amazing.
[02:21:02.139 --> 02:21:03.980]  Rodney should have had this at about 5 o'clock, though.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:04.641]  He could go longer.
[02:21:05.121 --> 02:21:06.461]  But he never... You think I have energy?
[02:21:06.481 --> 02:21:07.702]  This guy has too much energy.
[02:21:08.723 --> 02:21:09.343]  God bless you.
[02:21:09.363 --> 02:21:09.883]  Good to meet you.
[02:21:11.284 --> 02:21:11.704]  Alright.
[02:21:12.104 --> 02:21:14.105]  Thank you for joining us this evening.
[02:21:15.246 --> 02:21:15.606]  Welcome.
[02:21:16.146 --> 02:21:16.846]  Hi, Alex.
[02:21:17.347 --> 02:21:24.950]  Um... I'm so... I'm so starstruck.
[02:21:26.431 --> 02:21:27.271]  I love your t-shirt.
[02:21:27.391 --> 02:21:28.052]  Don't cry.
[02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:28.412]  Don't be.
[02:21:31.879 --> 02:21:33.879]  Don't upset Pastor Rodney.
[02:21:33.879 --> 02:21:37.879]  (laughter)
[02:21:37.879 --> 02:21:39.879]  God bless you.
[02:21:39.506 --> 02:21:40.767]  What's your question?
[02:21:41.968 --> 02:21:49.974]  My question is just going to get a picture with you, but I just want to... God bless you and you brought me back to Jesus.
[02:21:50.114 --> 02:22:03.002]   I was living up north in New England and I went to a really liberal university and I was completely ostracized and kicked off the campus for not getting the vaccine.
[02:22:03.263 --> 02:22:14.446]  And all of my friends now are, are transgender and all of them are sex workers and they, and they, and they worship Satan.
[02:22:15.266 --> 02:22:24.915]   And I moved down here to just get a new community and you were the only person who, um, Get me sane up there.
[02:22:24.995 --> 02:22:43.420]  I thought I was crazy for not believing in all these things, and my university was so anti-God, and they even taught, like, in the classes, they taught, like, so much bad stuff about you.
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:54.099]   They, like, they told the kid, they tell my friends, like, how Terrible you are like teaching in the classroom like it was some kind of education and I like
[02:22:55.421 --> 02:23:00.123]  There's a university down here in Lakeland that does that about me.
[02:23:00.163 --> 02:23:03.264]  They have a whole course of how bad Rodney Brown is.
[02:23:03.284 --> 02:23:05.285]  But that's a blessing because it helped.
[02:23:05.305 --> 02:23:06.306]  People didn't come to find the truth.
[02:23:06.666 --> 02:23:08.847]  That's a bad joke.
[02:23:08.987 --> 02:23:09.927]  I'm not glad they're lying.
[02:23:09.967 --> 02:23:13.288]  But yes, all over the country they have programs and they do it about him too.
[02:23:13.649 --> 02:23:15.329]  Specifically saying I'm the devil.
[02:23:15.909 --> 02:23:17.150]  But that's because they're scared.
[02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:18.030]  But God bless you.
[02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:21.272]  But look at your poor friends captured in that bondage.
[02:23:21.732 --> 02:23:22.772]  And what they're doing to them.
[02:23:22.852 --> 02:23:23.773]  And you escaped us.
[02:23:23.813 --> 02:23:24.373]  That's beautiful.
[02:23:25.744 --> 02:23:28.566]  It's thanks to you and thanks to Jesus, of course.
[02:23:28.706 --> 02:23:29.027]  Absolutely.
[02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:30.888]  Come on up here and let's get a picture.
[02:23:31.849 --> 02:23:33.650]  That's bad of these university folks.
[02:23:33.690 --> 02:23:34.751]  They're getting our young people.
[02:23:34.771 --> 02:23:36.412]  We need to go to these universities.
[02:23:37.032 --> 02:23:38.413]  We need to go to these universities.
[02:23:38.433 --> 02:23:40.235]  And we need to save the young people.
[02:23:40.275 --> 02:23:41.876]  What are you doing now?
[02:23:42.156 --> 02:23:42.797]  What do you do now?
[02:23:42.817 --> 02:23:44.998]  Come on up.
[02:23:45.098 --> 02:23:45.999]  I'm a waitress.
[02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:48.140]  Where do you live?
[02:23:48.801 --> 02:23:50.182]  I live at the home of Salsa.
[02:23:52.853 --> 02:23:53.313]  Nice to meet you.
[02:23:53.533 --> 02:23:55.714]  Well, I'll give you a scholarship to River University.
[02:23:55.734 --> 02:23:56.875]  It won't cost you anything.
[02:23:57.535 --> 02:23:57.875]  Absolutely.
[02:23:57.895 --> 02:23:59.396]  God bless you.
[02:24:00.536 --> 02:24:01.417]  Did you hear that, though?
[02:24:03.938 --> 02:24:05.238]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:24:05.258 --> 02:24:06.339]  Thanks for waiting.
[02:24:07.059 --> 02:24:09.400]  First of all, I want to thank you for taking a stand.
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:19.564]  And then second of all, I want to ask what you recommend for mothers with children and how we can prepare so they experience the least amount of evil possible.
[02:24:20.729 --> 02:24:30.039]  I mean, if you study our Western Christian culture, people told their kids fairy tales because they didn't want to scare them too much or they needed to know.
[02:24:30.059 --> 02:24:36.606]  So they said, hey, when you're walking to grandma's house in the woods, if a man tries to talk to you, you don't know they're the big bad wolf that might eat you.
[02:24:37.447 --> 02:24:42.527]   So if we don't put concern into our children, not fear, but understanding that the system
[02:24:42.527 --> 02:24:48.046]   is out to get them and that they need to trust their parents, and we also need a community
[02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:51.567]   around you where the system will come after you once you're identified.
[02:24:51.567 --> 02:24:56.047]   So everybody has to move to red areas, not that Republicans are perfect, everybody has
[02:24:56.047 --> 02:25:00.527]   to get to church and have a community that's good because they're coming for us.
[02:25:00.977 --> 02:25:07.439]  I mean, you think it's bad now, once your children aren't part of their system, they're already doing it, they're going to try to take Christians' children.
[02:25:07.819 --> 02:25:13.320]  But if you're under a church like Pastor Rodney's, and then people understand what's going on, you'll be able to stand.
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:23.383]  So move to conservative areas, live simple, live close to God, warn everybody you know what's going on, and realize that this whole system you see is going down.
[02:25:23.683 --> 02:25:26.204]  And they believe it's going to be the end of us, it's going to be the end of them.
[02:25:27.242 --> 02:25:28.183]  How old are your children?
[02:25:28.203 --> 02:25:28.823]  Can I get a picture?
[02:25:28.843 --> 02:25:30.144]  How old are your children?
[02:25:30.624 --> 02:25:33.786]  My children are 14, 9 and 7.
[02:25:33.886 --> 02:25:35.787]  You bring them to Youth Week and Kids Week.
[02:25:35.827 --> 02:25:37.107]  They were here this morning.
[02:25:37.347 --> 02:25:42.490]  Okay, but bring them to Youth Week and Kids Week that's coming up in a few weeks and get them under the anointing.
[02:25:42.850 --> 02:25:46.052]  Then the Holy Spirit will teach them and carry them like he's carried me.
[02:25:46.372 --> 02:25:46.993]  Wonderful.
[02:25:47.113 --> 02:25:47.793]  Thank you.
[02:25:47.993 --> 02:25:49.594]  And can I get a picture, please?
[02:25:50.194 --> 02:25:50.715]  Yes, please.
[02:25:50.735 --> 02:25:51.115]  Come on up.
[02:25:51.875 --> 02:25:53.875]  You guys are so awesome.
[02:25:53.875 --> 02:25:56.875]  (audience laughing)
[02:25:56.875 --> 02:25:58.194]  You're awesome, Alex.
[02:25:58.194 --> 02:26:00.375]  You guys don't actually think I built this, do you?
[02:26:00.375 --> 02:26:01.954]  (audience laughing)
[02:26:02.074 --> 02:26:03.695]  That's the dumbest thing on earth.
[02:26:04.836 --> 02:26:05.637]  So ridiculous.
[02:26:06.658 --> 02:26:13.383]  People actually go to me in restaurants, they go, Bill, Bill, when I turn around, they go, I know it's you.
[02:26:13.743 --> 02:26:15.945]  I'm like, no, you're saying Bill in the back of my head five times.
[02:26:20.588 --> 02:26:21.489]  All right, go ahead, sir.
[02:26:21.529 --> 02:26:21.849]  Welcome.
[02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:23.531]  What is the future of Ukraine?
[02:26:26.786 --> 02:26:28.786]  We don't have enough time.
[02:26:28.786 --> 02:26:30.786]  Yeah, I mean, the future is what the people do.
[02:26:30.786 --> 02:26:33.786]  It's a mess, it's a proxy war, it's a disaster.
[02:26:33.786 --> 02:26:35.786]  It could cause nuclear war, it's super dangerous.
[02:26:35.786 --> 02:26:37.786]  I hope peace comes out of it, I hope it ends.
[02:26:37.786 --> 02:26:44.515]   But, and I'm not blaming the US or Russia, it's the globalists, but they brag that they, you know, that the West started
[02:26:44.515 --> 02:26:49.786]   the war and basically lured Russia into it, and it's a disaster.
[02:26:49.786 --> 02:26:51.786]  So I think the future is what we make of it.
[02:26:51.786 --> 02:26:57.525]   I think we should be praying for peace, but also saying we shouldn't send $200 billion over there, or another $200
[02:26:57.525 --> 02:26:58.786]  billion.
[02:26:58.786 --> 02:27:02.786]   If they want to have a Slavic civil war, we should try to end it and pray for them,
[02:27:02.786 --> 02:27:04.786]  but we shouldn't put money into it.
[02:27:04.786 --> 02:27:07.786]   And so I say we don't support Russia or we don't support Ukraine,
[02:27:07.786 --> 02:27:10.786]  and we tell them, "Grow up and stop killing each other."
[02:27:10.786 --> 02:27:12.786]  Can I get a picture with you?
[02:27:12.786 --> 02:27:14.786]  Yeah, come on up.
[02:27:14.786 --> 02:27:24.786]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:27:17.492 --> 02:27:18.573]  Welcome, I love that shirt.
[02:27:18.834 --> 02:27:20.435]  It's a joke shirt, but it's fun.
[02:27:20.756 --> 02:27:22.678]  Alex Jones, President.
[02:27:23.098 --> 02:27:25.521]  We all want you to take it more seriously though, you know that.
[02:27:27.285 --> 02:27:34.628]  My name is Lacey, I do go by Liberty Lacey, and I want everybody to check out the Liberty Broadcast on Tuesday nights.
[02:27:34.968 --> 02:27:39.190]  Thank you Alex for inviting me here tonight, because I didn't even know how close you were.
[02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:44.372]  I'm from South Tampa, grew up in South Tampa, and I didn't even know that this amazing church was here.
[02:27:44.532 --> 02:27:47.893]  So thank you Alex for inviting everybody out tonight.
[02:27:48.333 --> 02:27:48.613]  Beautiful.
[02:27:48.633 --> 02:27:49.093]  Thank you.
[02:27:49.113 --> 02:27:54.696]  And I'm actually wanting to know, when are you going to go on the Liberty Broadcast?
[02:27:54.736 --> 02:27:55.556]  We've all been waiting.
[02:27:56.076 --> 02:28:01.179]  Well, there's a lot of shows called the Liberty Broadcast, so, specifically, and you go by what?
[02:28:01.699 --> 02:28:06.002]  Liberty Lacey, and I'm talking about with Alex Jones and Rachel Salazar.
[02:28:06.822 --> 02:28:09.364]  Okay, yeah, send us a message.
[02:28:09.404 --> 02:28:10.485]  I'd love to do other interviews.
[02:28:10.665 --> 02:28:12.126]  And you know I'm going to ask for a picture.
[02:28:12.586 --> 02:28:13.406]  Sure, come on up here.
[02:28:15.568 --> 02:28:16.128]  God bless you.
[02:28:16.348 --> 02:28:16.748]  Thank you.
[02:28:18.910 --> 02:28:19.350]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:28:20.313 --> 02:28:22.855]  Hey Alex, I've been listening to you for nearly 20 years.
[02:28:23.155 --> 02:28:26.958]  I'm one of your clippers that take clips out of your show and spread them all over the internet.
[02:28:27.179 --> 02:28:27.999]  Incredible job!
[02:28:28.079 --> 02:28:30.842]  Yes sir, and I've been doing that since the days of Myspace.
[02:28:31.162 --> 02:28:32.943]  Wow, you're the only reason we get out there.
[02:28:33.143 --> 02:28:33.604]  Yes sir.
[02:28:33.624 --> 02:28:35.225]  People like you putting the clips out?
[02:28:35.665 --> 02:28:47.976]   That's what I was telling Pastor E, I go listen, you want to tell your church members Shoot Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Rumble, little clips you think are good on your own phone, upload it, because they can't, the bots won't be able to stop and censor it.
[02:28:48.396 --> 02:28:56.441]  And maybe you get a thousand views, maybe you get a million, but it's going to be you putting the clips out that is overriding the AI and the censorship.
[02:28:56.681 --> 02:28:58.102]  So I want to salute this guy right here.
[02:28:58.622 --> 02:28:59.863]  Oh thank you, that's an honor Alex.
[02:29:00.883 --> 02:29:05.226]  And it's not just sharing links, I take physical clips and that's how you beat the algorithms.
[02:29:06.192 --> 02:29:06.633]  Absolutely.
[02:29:06.653 --> 02:29:07.634]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[02:29:07.454 --> 02:29:11.174]   doesn't want you on their platform, I just keep putting you back on there. I've got thousands
[02:29:11.174 --> 02:29:13.655]   and thousands of views of videos from you on my Facebook page.
[02:29:13.655 --> 02:29:15.155]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[02:29:15.155 --> 02:29:16.155]  Yes sir, thank you.
[02:29:16.155 --> 02:29:23.155]  Love you brother.
[02:29:23.155 --> 02:29:27.094]   And I've seen the same arguments from people that want to try and say that you're a controlled
[02:29:27.094 --> 02:29:28.375]  opposition or a shill.
[02:29:28.712 --> 02:29:34.237]  And they always resort to this Zionism and Jew stuff, and you don't expose that the Jews rule the world.
[02:29:34.617 --> 02:29:40.642]  And when that fails, they resort to saying that you're the comedian Bill Hicks that's pretending to play this part of Alex Jones.
[02:29:40.682 --> 02:29:43.205]  And it's the same thing I've seen over and over again over the years.
[02:29:43.225 --> 02:29:49.403]   And it doesn't itch that guy earlier, but he wouldn't, when they call in, They go, blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:49.423 --> 02:29:50.104]  They don't want to answer.
[02:29:50.164 --> 02:29:51.965]  I'm like, I'm not even talking about Israel.
[02:29:52.806 --> 02:29:57.730]  The pastor goes to Knesset and gripes them out for not letting him proselytize over there.
[02:29:58.211 --> 02:29:59.292]  It's completely insane.
[02:30:00.693 --> 02:30:01.914]  But that's what they do.
[02:30:01.954 --> 02:30:03.916]  They just go, oh, you're a mason.
[02:30:04.236 --> 02:30:07.960]  Instead of looking at what you say, because it makes them feel superior to you.
[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:10.962]  It makes them like, oh, well, I'm not going to listen to this.
[02:30:10.982 --> 02:30:12.604]  I mean, it just came out.
[02:30:12.624 --> 02:30:13.625]  More documents this week.
[02:30:14.659 --> 02:30:18.721]  They're having 500 fatalities a week extra just from heart attacks, from the shot.
[02:30:19.061 --> 02:30:20.762]  The UK government knows it, just the UK.
[02:30:21.322 --> 02:30:22.803]  Why don't you warn people about that?
[02:30:23.083 --> 02:30:25.684]  But all they do on these shows is just go, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
[02:30:25.984 --> 02:30:28.725]  Or whatever group it is they're attacking, and then it does nothing.
[02:30:29.125 --> 02:30:30.766]  And so much of that is just federal funding.
[02:30:30.786 --> 02:30:32.767]  And I'm not saying everybody that's involved is a Fed.
[02:30:33.087 --> 02:30:34.148]  It just goes nowhere.
[02:30:34.428 --> 02:30:35.288]  It's like a fetish.
[02:30:35.368 --> 02:30:40.090]  It's like a... It's because... It's like a pecking order, like being the coolest guy in the high school.
[02:30:40.450 --> 02:30:43.872]  So if you can say, this person doesn't talk about... I mean, here's an example.
[02:30:44.784 --> 02:30:49.365]  I was reading the Wall Street Journal on an airplane, like 15, 16 years ago.
[02:30:49.665 --> 02:30:55.786]  It had a pie chart of how Saudi Arabia and Muslim countries were buying up Hollywood.
[02:30:56.746 --> 02:31:01.807]  And it said that if you added up all their pieces, they were the largest sub-owner of Hollywood.
[02:31:02.087 --> 02:31:03.327]  Not controlling Hollywood.
[02:31:03.347 --> 02:31:07.008]  It was a Wall Street Journal article about how they had bought up Hollywood.
[02:31:07.748 --> 02:31:11.969]  And I just said, have a look at this article, the Arabs now own the largest stake in Hollywood.
[02:31:12.529 --> 02:31:13.850]  And the Nazis went crazy.
[02:31:13.890 --> 02:31:16.232]  They went, Jones says Jews aren't in Hollywood.
[02:31:16.512 --> 02:31:17.453]  I'm like, what does that even mean?
[02:31:17.633 --> 02:31:23.517]  I'm reading a Wall Street Journal article about how, and now you see how Saudi Arabia's bought the PGA and everything.
[02:31:23.998 --> 02:31:25.639]  I mean, and now they're going to buy all the other sports.
[02:31:25.699 --> 02:31:28.901]  I'm just like reading articles, like, oh, Jones says they own the PGA!
[02:31:29.101 --> 02:31:30.222]  Oh, cover up for Israel!
[02:31:30.282 --> 02:31:33.745]  It's like, I'm reading a, it's the same thing with the frauds deal.
[02:31:33.785 --> 02:31:37.948]  I was reading a Berkeley scientific study like 20 years ago.
[02:31:39.187 --> 02:31:52.358]  And then it got picked up later, and I said it again, and it's like, okay, 10% of the frogs convert to female, and all of them are feminized, and half of them are sterilized, and it says they're literally a part of the frogs become gay and try to have sex with the male.
[02:31:53.299 --> 02:31:56.342]  And then they go, look, he says they're turning frogs gay.
[02:31:56.362 --> 02:31:57.122]  I was reading a report.
[02:31:57.883 --> 02:32:02.046]  So it's the same thing, like, oh look, the Muslim countries have bought up a controlling share of Hollywood.
[02:32:02.127 --> 02:32:03.488]  Oh my gosh, they're coming in for the Jews!
[02:32:04.170 --> 02:32:07.874]  Hey, look, the frogs though, the atrazine's sterilizing them.
[02:32:07.974 --> 02:32:10.716]  Shut up, you crazy person!
[02:32:11.937 --> 02:32:13.719]  Sorry, I'm ranting here.
[02:32:13.799 --> 02:32:18.904]  I want them to fight for issues and talk about things.
[02:32:19.144 --> 02:32:23.829]  Meanwhile, the ADL, which is the evil leftist communist group, wants to be arrested.
[02:32:24.889 --> 02:32:28.170]  I've had like the CIA trying to shut me down.
[02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:31.730]  I've had the Southern Poverty Law Center put infiltrators in my office.
[02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:33.171]  I'm under total attack!
[02:32:33.471 --> 02:32:35.871]  And they go, yeah, it's because you work for the Jews.
[02:32:36.511 --> 02:32:40.852]  And you just point out, it's like a woodpecker though.
[02:32:41.072 --> 02:32:42.492]  It's all, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[02:32:42.552 --> 02:32:43.312]  It's all they do.
[02:32:43.552 --> 02:32:44.933]  And I feel sorry for those people.
[02:32:45.373 --> 02:32:49.073]  Because saying I'm Bill Hicks, or saying I work for Israel is insane.
[02:32:49.673 --> 02:32:51.214]  It's totally insane.
[02:32:51.474 --> 02:32:52.094]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:32:52.114 --> 02:32:52.494]  They love it.
[02:32:53.514 --> 02:33:00.216]  They'll take this clip, put it out, all congratulate each other, and it'll get 100,000 views, which is small, but it's still something, and I'll get those viewers!
[02:33:00.456 --> 02:33:02.877]  Come to InfoWars.com, see what I actually talk about.
[02:33:03.597 --> 02:33:04.257]  Anyways, anything else?
[02:33:04.697 --> 02:33:10.479]  Yes, sir, my question... Hey, I hit my second wind, we're not always leaving now.
[02:33:11.499 --> 02:33:14.300]  I'm gonna make... You know his nickname, right?
[02:33:15.861 --> 02:33:17.101]  I'm not gonna do it... Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:33:17.621 --> 02:33:19.462]  I'm torturing a little... It's very sweet.
[02:33:20.042 --> 02:33:20.582]  Anyways, sir.
[02:33:21.914 --> 02:33:22.795]  We're gonna have a contest.
[02:33:22.815 --> 02:33:24.336]  Who can guess his nickname?
[02:33:25.277 --> 02:33:25.938]  Anyway, I'm gonna stop.
[02:33:26.158 --> 02:33:26.639]  Alright, go ahead.
[02:33:27.159 --> 02:33:35.407]  Okay, so I've been on high alert with the coming vaccines since the year 2009 when you did that episode with Jesse Ventura on Conspiracy Theory with Dr. Alex!
[02:33:35.808 --> 02:33:37.670]  Are you telling me the vaccines?
[02:33:37.710 --> 02:33:38.090]  Sorry.
[02:33:38.791 --> 02:33:40.392]  With Dr. Rima Labo.
[02:33:41.293 --> 02:33:41.734]  And, uh...
[02:33:42.646 --> 02:33:44.908]  And I've been watching it all go down ever since then.
[02:33:44.948 --> 02:33:48.792]  I had a warning from you in 2009 not to take that jab.
[02:33:49.593 --> 02:33:51.955]  All these years later, it all surfaced.
[02:33:52.255 --> 02:33:58.101]  And I owe so much gratitude to you because you woke me up and snapped me out of it because I probably would have fallen in line with you.
[02:33:58.161 --> 02:34:02.465]  Well, you know how we knew, Dr. Rima Lebo, General Stubblebine, was the head of the Army at one point.
[02:34:03.555 --> 02:34:07.078]  And he would never tell her classified stuff, but he would say, well, they were actually working on your right here, right there.
[02:34:07.319 --> 02:34:12.323]  But she was a top doctor, still is, I didn't get her back on the show, who treated heads of state.
[02:34:13.304 --> 02:34:18.007]  She had a major head of state say, too bad, we're going to have to kill everybody soon with a vaccine.
[02:34:18.408 --> 02:34:19.529]  It'll erase their immune system.
[02:34:20.730 --> 02:34:22.711]  And so, and then we had documents where the U.N.
[02:34:22.731 --> 02:34:29.277]  was saying, we're going to use a virus release to inject everybody, bring in a World ID medical system.
[02:34:30.017 --> 02:34:31.178]  It's all in Operation Lockstep.
[02:34:31.398 --> 02:34:33.440]  It's not like Q or I heard it from Intel.
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:37.162]  The Rockefeller Foundation and the UN admit this is their whole plan.
[02:34:37.483 --> 02:34:39.624]  So, people say, how did Jones, must be one of them too.
[02:34:39.865 --> 02:34:40.545]  How do you know that?
[02:34:40.785 --> 02:34:44.708]  Well, because they wrote a massive report called Operation Lockstep 2011.
[02:34:45.108 --> 02:34:49.692]  And then a year before they released cover, they said, Disease X will soon be released.
[02:34:49.952 --> 02:34:53.475]  Probably some kind of bird flu out of China and we're going to take over with it.
[02:34:54.781 --> 02:34:57.402]  So they love to brag, and that's what's so frustrating.
[02:34:57.842 --> 02:34:59.082]  Pastor Rodney, why do they love to brag?
[02:34:59.102 --> 02:34:59.522]  Thank you, sir.
[02:34:59.762 --> 02:35:01.043]  We gotta go to everybody else here.
[02:35:01.283 --> 02:35:02.343]  Can I get a picture with you, sir?
[02:35:02.423 --> 02:35:02.503]  Sure.
[02:35:02.543 --> 02:35:03.703]  Why do they love to brag so much?
[02:35:03.763 --> 02:35:08.763]   Like they tell us how they're gonna do it, and there's like a spiritual blindness to him where people don't see
[02:35:08.763 --> 02:35:12.763]  how the villains are monologuing how they did it.
[02:35:12.763 --> 02:35:20.763]  He's not answering the question yet.
[02:35:20.147 --> 02:35:21.147]  Can you see that?
[02:35:21.147 --> 02:35:22.147]  [laughter]
[02:35:22.147 --> 02:35:23.147]  I mean, it's...
[02:35:23.147 --> 02:35:24.147]  They have been brain damaged.
[02:35:24.147 --> 02:35:24.147]  [laughter]
[02:35:25.147 --> 02:35:26.147]  [laughter]
[02:35:26.147 --> 02:35:27.147]  I mean, it's...
[02:35:27.147 --> 02:35:28.147]  They have been brain damaged.
[02:35:28.147 --> 02:35:28.147]  [laughter]
[02:35:29.147 --> 02:35:30.147]  They have been brain damaged.
[02:35:30.147 --> 02:35:30.147]  [laughter]
[02:35:30.147 --> 02:35:33.147]  (audience laughing)
[02:35:33.526 --> 02:35:34.566]  People are brain damaged.
[02:35:34.946 --> 02:35:36.607]  He's too shook up about the nickname right now.
[02:35:36.867 --> 02:35:38.108]  No, I'm not.
[02:35:38.308 --> 02:35:39.188]  It's a joke.
[02:35:39.568 --> 02:35:40.068]  Not at all.
[02:35:41.369 --> 02:35:42.489]  I'm not at all.
[02:35:44.690 --> 02:35:47.831]  Where's Octavia?
[02:35:49.031 --> 02:35:49.312]  Come here.
[02:35:49.552 --> 02:35:50.272]  Where's Pastor Ray?
[02:35:54.477 --> 02:36:04.304]  I just think we should do this right now, because it's already... we go off the satellite in another ten minutes, and then we're off our satellite feed.
[02:36:05.585 --> 02:36:09.708]  We're covering America right now on the Dish and Direct platform, four hours.
[02:36:10.769 --> 02:36:12.430]  So, and then all of our satellites.
[02:36:12.470 --> 02:36:15.312]  So, I want to do this before we go off the satellite.
[02:36:15.672 --> 02:36:18.955]  Octavia, if you'll come here, I know you're going to enjoy this right now.
[02:36:20.006 --> 02:36:22.207]  Because, um, I want to just pray of America.
[02:36:22.227 --> 02:36:24.647]  Because that's what we're fighting for firstly.
[02:36:25.347 --> 02:36:26.747]  Somebody said, what about my country?
[02:36:26.828 --> 02:36:27.848]  You have to fight for that.
[02:36:27.888 --> 02:36:28.828]  We're fighting for America.
[02:36:28.848 --> 02:36:29.508]  But I want to hear her sing again!
[02:36:29.528 --> 02:36:30.048]  That was the best singing.
[02:36:30.088 --> 02:36:31.168]  I've never seen somebody go like two minutes.
[02:36:31.188 --> 02:36:51.637]   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa No, I want you to sing.
[02:36:53.199 --> 02:36:53.779]  Absolutely.
[02:36:55.621 --> 02:36:56.142]  Thank you so much.
[02:36:56.162 --> 02:36:57.423]  That was the best song ever earlier.
[02:36:57.443 --> 02:36:57.823]  Amazing.
[02:36:59.004 --> 02:37:00.185]  She's been working hard today, too.
[02:37:00.205 --> 02:37:01.547]  She's like, man, I've been here since 8am.
[02:37:01.386 --> 02:37:03.386]  8am. Here we go.

[02:39:26.547 --> 02:39:27.108]  Amazing.
[02:39:31.151 --> 02:39:31.631]  Another one.
[02:39:33.333 --> 02:39:33.993]  Encore.

[02:46:56.150 --> 02:47:04.973]  Even you said that you would not destroy a city because of 50 righteous, and 40 or 30 or even 5.
[02:47:06.013 --> 02:47:08.194]  Well Lord, there's more than 50 righteous here.
[02:47:09.014 --> 02:47:14.376]  Therefore, those that want to destroy this land are not going to be able to because we're still here.
[02:47:15.436 --> 02:47:19.818]  We are here and you hear from heaven and you're the God that answers by fire.
[02:47:20.579 --> 02:47:22.760]  And I thank you that you shall deliver your people.
[02:47:23.180 --> 02:47:27.502]  Thank you that even right now, tonight, you're pulling the wheels off of Pharaoh's chariots.
[02:47:28.083 --> 02:47:30.104]  Wreak total havoc in the camp of the wicked.
[02:47:30.624 --> 02:47:33.946]  Let them turn on each other like a dog on its own tail.
[02:47:34.486 --> 02:47:42.192]   And I pray for America The great spiritual awakening that will shake this land to the very foundation of corn, bring it back.
[02:47:42.812 --> 02:47:46.575]  May its eagles fall one more time, and Father we thank you for it.
[02:47:46.995 --> 02:47:56.823]  I pray for Alex, the battle that he's been under, Lord, even people want him to pay 1.6 billion, some want him to pay 2.75 trillion, total insanity.
[02:47:56.843 --> 02:48:02.323]   I pray that you deliver him totally out of the clutches, the snare of the fowler.
[02:48:02.323 --> 02:48:07.762]   Lord, even as you've touched him this morning and just revitalized him, I pray that he shall
[02:48:07.762 --> 02:48:13.402]   go from here when he leaves on Wednesday, he shall leave here with a fresh wind behind
[02:48:13.402 --> 02:48:14.402]  him.
[02:48:14.402 --> 02:48:18.123]   And Lord, you shall use him in even a greater way than he's ever been used before.
[02:48:18.123 --> 02:48:23.003]   I pray supernatural protection upon him, his wife, his daughter, his family, and everything
[02:48:23.003 --> 02:48:26.202]   that he touches, that Lord, you will lead him by your spirit.
[02:48:26.561 --> 02:48:27.501]  Thank you for his life.
[02:48:27.841 --> 02:48:28.801]  Thank you for his voice.
[02:48:29.242 --> 02:48:42.866]  And Father, we just thank you for your people here today, that as they leave here tonight, they leave here with a passion and with a purpose, and each one to find out that one thing that you want them to do above all, and they do that.
[02:48:43.487 --> 02:48:47.313]  And then, of course, to tell everybody they know about Jesus.
[02:48:47.373 --> 02:48:48.374]  And we thank you for it now.
[02:48:48.735 --> 02:48:50.398]  And I pray a blessing upon them now.
[02:48:50.738 --> 02:48:52.281]  May they have a supernatural week.
[02:48:52.581 --> 02:48:54.684]  We pray this now in Jesus' name.
[02:48:55.285 --> 02:48:55.626]  Amen.
[02:48:56.407 --> 02:48:56.667]  Amen.
