[00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:08.098]  It's Sunday, November 19th, 2023.
[00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:12.702]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:16.825]  And we got a lot of really important stuff to talk about.
[00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:20.948]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:29.266]  It's Sunday, November 19, 2023.
[00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:38.070]  And we're now 351 days, 7 hours, 49 minutes, 36 seconds out from the most important election in world history.
[00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.550]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.212]  Very blessed and very honored to be here with you tonight.
[00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:49.014]  We'll be here live the next four hours, and I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:49.534]  Central.
[00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.175]  Every show's precious.
[00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:54.276]  Every day above ground is a good day, as they say.
[00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:59.637]  Okay, let me give you a little boil down of what's coming up, and then we hit next segment.
[00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:01.918]  I'll plunge right into it.
[00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:03.698]  Biden is in total free-for-all.
[00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:07.679]  They haven't just had Axelrod and other top Democrats say he should resign.
[00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.600]  Now Bill Maher and the rest of them are saying it.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:24.684]  The Democratic Party is officially trying to take out Joe Biden, and it's his 81st birthday, so they want to show him the door so the new Chinese communist puppet, aka American Psycho 2.0, Gavin Newsom, can take over.
[00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:32.760]  And we've got them in complete panic mode because Trump's poll numbers are turbocharging to even higher levels.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.644]  Their attempt to take him off the ballot in Colorado has failed so much more on that front coming up.
[00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:45.328]  Then, of course, the new Speaker of the House has made good on a promise McCarthy made almost a year ago.
[00:01:46.297 --> 00:01:56.101]  But in over 10 months failed, he is now beginning to release, because as fast as they can put it out, it's going to take about two weeks, they're saying, 44,000 hours.
[00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:01.363]  They've already put out something like 5,000 hours starting Friday.
[00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:02.784]  I have watched a lot of it.
[00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:14.949]  It is more of what we knew happened, except you've got undercover cops who are arrested, being released, and you've got the police waving people through and shaking their hands and taking selfies with them.
[00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:19.220]  So the Feds and some provocateurs helped break in.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.621]  The cops then stood down.
[00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:22.822]  And you know the rest of the story.
[00:02:22.822 --> 00:02:28.105]  But it's hour after hour after hour after hour.
[00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:31.027]  And the initial quote breach where they just opened the doors up.
[00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:32.515]  Yes, we are.
[00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:54.696]  Turns against the war.
[00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:58.058]  68% of Americans polled are against the war.
[00:02:58.058 --> 00:03:00.680]  80 plus percent against the Ukraine war.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.601]  Ukraine must brace for loss of U.S.
[00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:03.502]  support.
[00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:11.707]  The Ukrainian ambassador says big developments in that World War III developing scenario as well.
[00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:14.409]  We've also got more on the poison shot front U.S.
[00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.629]  Army.
[00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:20.818]  Begging unvaccinated soldiers to return after kicking them out for refusing COVID vaccine mandates.
[00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:40.060]  Dishonorable discharges and non-honorable discharges if they come back.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.401]  I wouldn't believe that for a minute.
[00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:47.545]  And for two weeks I've said I'm going to cover the solar flares, they say, the threat to knock out the internet.
[00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:52.027]  But I'm going to get to it tonight, if the hair lifts the Admiral.
[00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:54.129]  We are going to be breaking that down.
[00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.552]  Also, mysterious CEO firing at chat GPT triggers employee protest.
[00:03:59.552 --> 00:04:01.053]  Resignations even on the board.
[00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:02.074]  They're trying to bring him back.
[00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:10.574]  This is a big example of what happened with James O'Keefe with these boards and with groups that get control of companies.
[00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:14.719]  They always go after the most successful people because they're threatened by him.
[00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.604]  He took the company from nowhere to 80 billion dollars, so they fired him.
[00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:25.709]  Yep, that's how these weirdos that don't set up and run companies and create them operate and they get control of them.
[00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:29.912]  They always go after who's actually successful.
[00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:32.594]  You'd think in the real world you'd promote who's successful.
[00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:36.617]  A meritocracy, not in the new world order.
[00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:45.143]  That's just some of what's coming up on this massive Sunday live global transmission.
[00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:46.064]  There's also some
[00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:55.287]  Other big news, we're going to be getting to dealing with election fraud in the 2020 election that's now pouring out.
[00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:56.449]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:07.467]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:12.154]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:16.520]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:21.005]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:22.567]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:28.512]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:34.558]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:37.321]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.531]  I don't know.
[00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.704]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:13.704 --> 00:06:21.368]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:48.847]  The globalists know humanity's awake, so they're miserably robbing everything they can, even the kitchen sink.
[00:06:48.847 --> 00:06:52.331]  Again, it's Sunday, November 19, 2023.
[00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:56.355]  351 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:10.800]  The chi-com dictator who obviously was just in San Francisco last week trying to line up all his little ducklings to continue to carry out the deindustrialization of the United States.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:21.024]  President Trump has come out against that and promised to reverse everything that they've done in the last three years if he gets back into office in a year.
[00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:26.446]  And we've got incredible news on that front that I want to dive into right now.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.581]  NBC News poll.
[00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:35.843]  Biden's standing hits new lows amid Israel-Hamas war.
[00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:41.265]  Even in their skewed polls, he's got a 40% approval rating.
[00:07:41.265 --> 00:07:50.468]  68% of Americans in major polls, there's three of them that show the same number, are against the war that Israel's having with Hamas.
[00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:59.384]  MSNBC melts down over polls showing Trump beating Biden in 2024 by 20 points.
[00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:05.566]  Trump opens up 39 point lead over DeSantis in Florida.
[00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:15.449]  Trump wins Texas Governor Abbott's endorsement at US-Mexico border as he served early Thanksgiving dinner to the troops and state police.
[00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:17.169]  Bill Maher throws in the towel.
[00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:18.550]  Biden's going to lose.
[00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:25.263]  Rogan sends The Rock back peddling over claims he has friends who support Biden.
[00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:26.123]  Sure, name some.
[00:08:26.123 --> 00:08:28.025]  He can.
[00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:31.428]  Fox News finds out the strength of Trump.
[00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:36.432]  The town hall they did, where every supporter, everybody in the town hall was a supporter, but one.
[00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:40.315]  And it just continues on from there.
[00:08:40.315 --> 00:08:44.919]  They are totally, absolutely in full panic mode.
[00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.702]  Normally, if the feds indict somebody, they drop out of a race immediately.
[00:08:49.704 --> 00:08:57.628]  They threatened to indict and tried to impeach, never passed the Senate, Richard Nixon, but he still resigned.
[00:08:57.628 --> 00:09:00.989]  But everybody knows this is a discredited power structure.
[00:09:00.989 --> 00:09:02.850]  Everybody knows we have an illegitimate government.
[00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:12.474]  Everybody knows, who's got half a brain cell, that the election was stolen in 2020, and they almost completely stole it, but stole most of it in 2022.
[00:09:12.474 --> 00:09:18.117]  And the numbers are there, and the facts are there, and the majority of Americans, including Democrats, believe the election was stolen from Biden.
[00:09:18.837 --> 00:09:21.258]  The man couldn't get 20 people at a campaign event.
[00:09:21.258 --> 00:09:27.482]  Trump was having up to 100,000 at his biggest, most 20,000, even in small towns.
[00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:29.222]  Standing ovations everywhere.
[00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:33.044]  But they tell you, do not question it.
[00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:35.926]  If you question the election, you are a criminal.
[00:09:36.894 --> 00:09:40.439]  Was in more articles this weekend, including Newsweek.
[00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:43.142]  Owen Schroer in solitary confinement.
[00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:51.333]  And then it quotes the judge that he's in jail in his sentencing document for questioning the election.
[00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:54.056]  They go, oh look, here's three examples of where
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:07.993]  Before sentencing, he still is on the air, the government surveilling a radio TV show, watching a journalist, and then creating a transcript to give the judge and say, look, he still says Trump won.
[00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:11.097]  And the judge says, you're not sorry.
[00:10:11.097 --> 00:10:14.200]  You go to jail and you get solitary confinement.
[00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:19.256]  Yeah, well, it's just 60 days.
[00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:23.438]  It's setting the precedent, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:23.438 --> 00:10:27.680]  And we saw what just happened and the total panicking going on.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:36.945]  We've got a clip we're going to play in a moment of the Secretary of State in Colorado, another one of these Soros finance kook balls.
[00:10:36.945 --> 00:10:42.868]  And they had another one of these rigged trials where it was a judge deciding, not a jury.
[00:10:42.868 --> 00:10:43.529]  Since when
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:53.924]  In my fake trials, and Trump's New York trial, and the Colorado trial, it's judge.
[00:10:53.924 --> 00:11:00.686]  But in this case, the judge knew it would be overturned on appeal immediately, because Trump was never convicted of insurrection.
[00:11:00.686 --> 00:11:08.089]  So the judge said, well, you did do an insurrection, but under the law, I can't take you off of the ballot.
[00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:13.511]  And so no, you're guilty, because I'm the judge, no jury, but
[00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:19.573]  You can stay on the ballot and have failed in several other states to take Trump off the ballot.
[00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:30.904]  What's that called when somebody who's getting 70% against all the Republican candidates in primary polls and 20 points conservatively ahead of Biden?
[00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:32.685]  That's a record level.
[00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:33.566]  That's never happened before.
[00:11:33.566 --> 00:11:38.130]  I mean, Ronald Reagan was in a dead heat with Jimmy Carter on election day in 1980.
[00:11:41.212 --> 00:11:46.103]  Not since polling has somebody been 20 points ahead, and that's when the Democrats...
[00:11:47.116 --> 00:11:50.998]  The polling agencies still claim are 10-15% of a larger group.
[00:11:50.998 --> 00:11:52.678]  They see it as the dominant party.
[00:11:52.678 --> 00:12:00.602]  So they bake it in that they always add a skew in there where they, in the different methodologies, do different things.
[00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:06.264]  But in some of the polls, they poll more registered Democrats than Republicans.
[00:12:06.264 --> 00:12:08.465]  Or in other polls, they just add 10-15 points.
[00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:11.506]  So in the methodology, they've done that here.
[00:12:11.506 --> 00:12:14.367]  He's 20 points ahead in every damn poll.
[00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:15.128]  Some of them 25-30.
[00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:21.411]  And Mike, I mean, this is just spectacular.
[00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:23.292]  Spectacular.
[00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:30.216]  And their answer is, we're going to indict you a bunch and we're going to try to take you off the ballot.
[00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:38.141]  Just like they did to 15 members of Congress because they were in the Capitol on January 6th and Republicans like MTG, Gozer, and others.
[00:12:38.752 --> 00:12:46.618]  They went around and tried to take them off the ballot because they were going to win by 60-70% of re-election, and they did despite the fraud.
[00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:51.481]  Because in the case of MTG, you get 70% of people voting for you.
[00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:52.682]  They don't have enough dead people.
[00:12:52.682 --> 00:12:57.685]  They don't have enough names of dead people and people that have moved out of district to push it over the top.
[00:12:57.685 --> 00:13:02.148]  Landslides kill fraud.
[00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:07.052]  They can't get past a landslide of more than 10 points, depending on the numbers and the experts you talk to.
[00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:15.605]  Some of the numbers show if you've got a 7% lead that's real, there's not enough fraud baked in depending on the state to do it.
[00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:20.128]  Trump's got a 20 point mega blast!
[00:13:20.128 --> 00:13:27.411]  I mean, they're not going to overcome that without putting a bullet in him or poisoning him.
[00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:32.214]  I told you years ago Trump's concerned about poisoning, he should be, and now it's come out mainstream media he is.
[00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:38.357]  That's why I'll say almost every night, you know, I'm buying the whole White House staff
[00:13:39.977 --> 00:13:48.300]  Hamburgers or fried chicken or whatever it is and he'll pick a random staffer and he'll pick the place and he'll send them there and if they didn't get back in an hour he doesn't need it.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.842]  He has them all set the food out and then he walks in and randomly grabs a bag.
[00:13:52.842 --> 00:13:55.343]  Imagine having to live like that.
[00:13:55.343 --> 00:13:56.403]  You just say what you want about Trump.
[00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:57.744]  He is a man of steel.
[00:13:57.744 --> 00:14:00.285]  He is a badass.
[00:14:00.285 --> 00:14:02.326]  A badass.
[00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:04.446]  And I only wish he wouldn't have gone with the poison shots.
[00:14:04.446 --> 00:14:05.747]  At least he's backed off of that but
[00:14:06.994 --> 00:14:08.854]  This is just insane.
[00:14:08.854 --> 00:14:10.015]  So, we're going to go to break.
[00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:10.795]  I'm going to come back.
[00:14:10.795 --> 00:14:13.195]  Get out of jail free card for insurrection.
[00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:13.475]  Really?
[00:14:13.475 --> 00:14:14.556]  Was he convicted of that?
[00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:18.816]  Colorado Secretary of State blast court ruling allowing Trump on the ballot.
[00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:23.117]  Election theft, election interference, election meddling.
[00:14:23.117 --> 00:14:27.178]  I mean, the real way to steal something is not letting you be on the ballot.
[00:14:27.178 --> 00:14:34.520]  Oh, he's an insurrectionist for having a peaceful protest we hijacked and for questioning an election.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.640]  But now we're going to keep him from being able to be elected.
[00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:52.279]  And the State Department advised this year the government of, with Lula down in Brazil, for them to have the Supreme Court say that Bolsonaro can't run for eight years.
[00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:53.900]  Because he questioned the election.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.782]  It was overwhelming evidence of fraud.
[00:14:55.782 --> 00:15:00.586]  The same crooks that ran the election theft in 2020 ran the election theft in late 2022.
[00:15:02.395 --> 00:15:02.916]  Yes, we are.
[00:15:18.939 --> 00:15:26.285]  The Democratic Party is backing the robber baron, warmongering, black rock, New World Order establishment.
[00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:27.526]  They're the Imperials.
[00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.008]  They're the Redcoats.
[00:15:29.008 --> 00:15:30.929]  They're the King of England in 1776.
[00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:33.171]  They're the man.
[00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:39.537]  And it's out in the open, and the people know it, and the people see it, and the people understand it.
[00:15:39.537 --> 00:15:41.779]  So, they may be able to even steal this election again.
[00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:44.463]  They may kill Trump, but it'll be a Pyrrhic victory.
[00:15:44.463 --> 00:15:48.447]  They may win the battle, but they will lose the war.
[00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.888]  We'll get more to this when we come back.
[00:15:49.888 --> 00:15:56.674]  And then the January 6th footage now being released in full by the new Speaker of the House.
[00:15:56.674 --> 00:15:57.075]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:03.299]  Normally, Christmas is our biggest sale of the year.
[00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:07.862]  But because of supply chain breakdowns and other issues, this is our biggest sale.
[00:16:07.862 --> 00:16:12.125]  Because finally, almost all of our best-selling products are finally back in stock.
[00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:19.749]  Including, sold out for more than a year, X2, the only true nascent iodine out there, is finally back.

[00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:31.758]  Biggest sale, hands down, of 2023.
[00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:34.520]  I'm sure Christmas will have a big sale, but we'll be sold out of most of this.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.402]  So, Christmas has come early.
[00:16:36.402 --> 00:16:37.943]  Black Friday's come early.
[00:16:37.943 --> 00:16:39.304]  And it funds the InfoWar.

[00:16:51.694 --> 00:16:53.196]  Sold out for over a year.
[00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:55.017]  Could be our last run if we're shut down.
[00:16:55.017 --> 00:16:56.098]  Get it while you can.
[00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:56.839]  X2.
[00:16:56.839 --> 00:16:59.261]  Discount at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:00.662]  Bodies is back.

[00:17:06.647 --> 00:17:06.907]  I think so.

[00:17:32.286 --> 00:17:44.049]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[00:17:44.289 --> 00:17:47.772]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:02.282]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:08.783]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:18:08.783 --> 00:18:12.224]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.305]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:18:13.305 --> 00:18:17.786]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[00:18:17.786 --> 00:18:23.649]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:31.399]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:35.044]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:39.590]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.130]  We're good.
[00:18:58.982 --> 00:19:10.544]  Naturally sourced from the finest hemp plants in America, Rebel Zen offers the absolute finest quality CBD available and at the lowest prices.
[00:19:10.544 --> 00:19:25.127]  Extracted using a cold-pressed technique to retain the molecular integrity of the cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant, this full-spectrum formula ensures that your nervous system gets the full benefits of CBD.
[00:19:26.347 --> 00:19:36.751]  Premium quality organic CBD like Rebel Zen has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:44.854]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[00:19:44.854 --> 00:19:51.476]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[00:19:52.396 --> 00:20:01.639]  Order yours today at InfoWarStore.com!
[00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:07.541]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:25.895 --> 00:20:31.635]  Well, you tune into any mainstream media or the internet today and it sounds like the Alex Jones Show from 10 years ago!
[00:20:32.654 --> 00:20:34.355]  Yeah, it's our world.
[00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:38.258]  The listeners, the supporters, the guests of this broadcast, we were over the target.
[00:20:38.258 --> 00:20:39.478]  We were right.
[00:20:39.478 --> 00:20:43.261]  We explained who really ran the planet, what their plans were, and how horrible it would be.
[00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:53.247]  And because we got in this position to resist them, there is now extreme resistance to the globalists all over the world, and I want to salute you all and thank you.
[00:20:53.247 --> 00:20:54.688]  But they're trying to head us off at the pass.
[00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:58.410]  I'm going to break down what they're going to pull and how we can stop them here in a moment.
[00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:58.911]  But first,
[00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:14.181]  I am extremely excited to announce, I'd like an overhead shot please, here in a moment, that after over a year of not having it, Survival Shield X2, the number one all-time best-selling product, is back in stock.
[00:21:14.181 --> 00:21:15.523]  No one ever developed this.
[00:21:15.523 --> 00:21:17.505]  I got approached by a scientist ten years ago.
[00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:19.571]  Do you?
[00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:35.256]  It's a long story.
[00:21:35.256 --> 00:21:38.018]  In over a year, no one else has true atomic iodine.
[00:21:38.018 --> 00:21:39.479]  There's hundreds of them out there in the market.
[00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:41.060]  They're bound to other elements.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.281]  You don't get full absorption.
[00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:43.462]  It's not true.
[00:21:43.462 --> 00:21:50.047]  We have the only true nascent atomic iodine, meaning it's pure, on the market, and we would not dumb it down.
[00:21:50.047 --> 00:21:58.693]  We would not put out one that wasn't real, with all the licensing and all the DEA regulations and all the things to have real iodine, and then put it to the consumer market.
[00:22:00.031 --> 00:22:04.114]  We jumped through it all, ladies and gentlemen, and a limited supply is back in stock.
[00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.635]  Discounted 25% off.
[00:22:05.635 --> 00:22:10.239]  Takes about two weeks on average to kick in for somebody that's deficient.
[00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:12.240]  Now, overhead shot, please.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.923]  Nutrition effects of iodine deficiency.
[00:22:15.923 --> 00:22:17.884]  World Health Organization.
[00:22:17.884 --> 00:22:22.327]  And it says right here, at latest global estimate, 1.88 billion.
[00:22:22.327 --> 00:22:24.169]  That's almost 2 billion people.
[00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:28.252]  Including 241 million school-aged children have insufficient dietary iodine intake.
[00:22:29.124 --> 00:22:34.168]  You continue on from the United Nations' own site.
[00:22:34.168 --> 00:22:35.428]  And I guess I don't have the printout.
[00:22:35.428 --> 00:22:37.450]  I lost the sub-page of this.
[00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.651]  Please give it to me again from Wikipedia.
[00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:40.592]  It's the second page.
[00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:46.796]  It says two billion people are estimated to have cognitive disabilities from iodine deficiency.
[00:22:46.796 --> 00:22:50.899]  I thought I would have that page, but I wanted to show you that part.
[00:22:50.899 --> 00:22:53.962]  So just reprint me the Wikipedia on iodine deficiency, please.
[00:22:54.682 --> 00:22:57.083]  Somehow I got lost in here, in the pages.
[00:22:57.083 --> 00:23:02.845]  So, go do your own research, realize this is the best, and it funds the operation.
[00:23:02.845 --> 00:23:08.267]  If somebody else had this, I'd say still get it from us, because we're fighting the New World Order, so it's a win-win.
[00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:09.887]  But we're the only ones that have it.
[00:23:09.887 --> 00:23:11.808]  You need to get X2.
[00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:13.028]  Now back in stock.
[00:23:13.028 --> 00:23:14.349]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:16.869]  And the stuff lasts a long time.
[00:23:16.869 --> 00:23:17.830]  Many, many, many, many years.
[00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:19.244]  So
[00:23:39.016 --> 00:23:39.396]  We're good to go.
[00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.831]  It's about to sell out.
[00:23:58.831 --> 00:24:08.198]  HH Max Post 2.0, InfoWarsTore.com, also PainMD, Natural Pain Relief, Incredible, and 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:24:08.198 --> 00:24:11.360]  Those are all at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.162]  And then everybody needs high quality
[00:24:18.664 --> 00:24:21.166]  30 parts per million silver.
[00:24:21.166 --> 00:24:24.588]  And that's what experts believe is the safest and best.
[00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:27.229]  You can do it even stronger, but then it has some toxic effects.
[00:24:27.229 --> 00:24:29.611]  It's antibacterial, antiviral, everybody knows that.
[00:24:29.611 --> 00:24:32.792]  And we have silver bullets, private label from the top lab in the U.S.
[00:24:32.792 --> 00:24:36.695]  It's sold under other names, by Whole Foods, everybody else.
[00:24:36.695 --> 00:24:41.558]  But when you buy it from us, you get top flight stuff, and you get a good price on it, and it funds the operation.
[00:24:41.558 --> 00:24:42.158]  So here it is.
[00:24:42.158 --> 00:24:44.459]  They actually found the page very quickly.
[00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:46.941]  This is cognitive iodine deficiency syndrome.
[00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:48.282]  We're good to go!
[00:25:09.185 --> 00:25:14.089]  Put a drop of it in my mineral water or in a glass of orange juice.
[00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:17.351]  And when I forget to take it every day, I really, really feel it.
[00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:18.431]  X2, back in stock.
[00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:19.933]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:25:19.933 --> 00:25:21.394]  Silver Bullet, back in stock.
[00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:23.155]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:26.737]  Selling out is the ACH Max Boost.
[00:25:26.737 --> 00:25:31.000]  The 7076 testosterone boost is getting close, so is the Pain MD.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.761]  These are really great products, so it's a win-win.
[00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:35.783]  You get products that enrich your life and it keeps the broadcast on air.
[00:25:36.904 --> 00:25:39.366]  All right, let's go ahead now.
[00:25:39.366 --> 00:25:40.487]  Oh, and I should have added we have
[00:26:06.944 --> 00:26:14.390]  Okay, getting back to where I was.
[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:28.562]  So here is the Secretary of State of Colorado when Trump has been found not guilty even by the judge in a kangaroo trial of insurrection.
[00:26:28.562 --> 00:26:30.003]  He's not been found guilty anywhere.
[00:26:30.003 --> 00:26:33.486]  So how do you civilly find him guilty and take him off the ballot?
[00:26:33.486 --> 00:26:35.467]  Under the 14th Amendment.
[00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:36.028]  And so here is
[00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:41.462]  Jenna Grissmould freaking out.
[00:26:41.462 --> 00:26:43.042]  Here it is.
[00:26:43.042 --> 00:26:53.384]  You said to me then, which literally almost every Secretary of State in the country to whom NBC has spoken, said, that you're likely not going to be the last voice on this thing.
[00:26:53.384 --> 00:26:57.665]  You can do what you may think you need to do, but this is definitely going to the courts.
[00:26:57.665 --> 00:26:59.865]  So that's what happened in Colorado.
[00:26:59.865 --> 00:27:04.266]  It went to the courts, and lots of people are surprised by what happened yesterday.
[00:27:04.266 --> 00:27:04.526]  Are you?
[00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:09.229]  Well, first off, thanks for having me on, Ali.
[00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:10.549]  Always great to be on your show.
[00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:14.971]  And yes, this is a surprising ruling.
[00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:17.813]  I think you are really hitting it on the head.
[00:27:17.813 --> 00:27:30.158]  The idea that any official who would engage in insurrection would be barred from taking office except the presidency is incredibly surprising.
[00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:34.720]  That basically means that the presidency is a get-out-of-jail-free card for insurrection.
[00:27:35.623 --> 00:27:41.365]  As someone who cares deeply about the state of our democracy, I find that very troubling.
[00:27:41.365 --> 00:27:53.830]  The American people need to know that the President, the person, if anybody, the person most in charge of protecting the Constitution, actually has a duty to do so.
[00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.371]  So I'm right there with you.
[00:27:55.371 --> 00:28:04.274]  I find it very troubling that the President of the United States could engage in insurrection and, unlike everybody else, could then be President again.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.682]  They just make this up.
[00:28:09.682 --> 00:28:11.703]  Yeah, Joe Biggs that shook a fence.
[00:28:11.703 --> 00:28:14.645]  He's been put in jail for 20-something years for shaking a fence.
[00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:18.126]  He didn't burn down a police station or shoot cops, so he's okay.
[00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:23.049]  He wasn't bailed out by the Vice President when she was a candidate, Kamala Harris.
[00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:30.472]  They just keep using the word insurrection, insurrection, insurrection, but now they're in full panic mode because the videos have all come out.
[00:28:30.472 --> 00:28:31.153]  And if I try to
[00:28:32.383 --> 00:28:33.583]  Play all this would take 10 hours.
[00:28:33.583 --> 00:28:35.964]  Well, that would take 44,000 hours.
[00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:39.664]  We're going to play some of the clips to talk about that when we come back.
[00:28:39.664 --> 00:28:43.525]  The new speaker did what McCarthy didn't do.
[00:28:43.525 --> 00:28:44.965]  He's releasing it.
[00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:48.946]  They released something like 4,000 hours as of today, as fast as they can.
[00:28:48.946 --> 00:28:50.226]  They're piping it out.
[00:28:50.226 --> 00:28:52.127]  It'll take a few weeks to get it all out.
[00:28:52.127 --> 00:28:53.887]  And boy, is it damning.
[00:28:53.887 --> 00:28:56.588]  I didn't know guided tours were an insurrection.
[00:28:56.588 --> 00:28:58.528]  They charged many of those that were waived in by police.
[00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:06.093]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:29:06.093 --> 00:29:10.775]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:29:10.775 --> 00:29:14.936]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:16.577 --> 00:29:19.640]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.201]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:27.166]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:33.190]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.952]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:39.046]  I don't know.
[00:29:59.278 --> 00:30:01.019]  Your products have changed my life.
[00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:03.181]  Your brain force and all that makes me better.
[00:30:03.181 --> 00:30:04.381]  They make me more focused.
[00:30:04.381 --> 00:30:05.462]  They make me feel better.
[00:30:05.462 --> 00:30:09.925]  A lot of lingering effects from when I was getting sober have now relieved me.
[00:30:09.925 --> 00:30:11.686]  My girlfriend goes to the gym and goes hard.
[00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:13.627]  She's done the same stuff.
[00:30:13.627 --> 00:30:15.629]  These products will change your life.
[00:30:15.629 --> 00:30:20.612]  They find one of the greatest things out there right now for us as free Americans.
[00:30:20.612 --> 00:30:21.973]  Please do these people a favor.
[00:30:22.473 --> 00:30:29.578]  Go to their store, support them, do what you need to do, because if we lose InfoWars, we lose a lot more than what people are willing to believe.
[00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:46.629]  If you want to really get in shape for this thing about to come, get the HGH and get that testosterone boost, man, get in the gym, because I'm in the best shape of my life because of your product, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to not lose the greatest symbol against tyranny the world has ever seen, and that's our American flag.
[00:30:46.629 --> 00:30:48.611]  And with that, I appreciate loving InfoWars.
[00:30:48.611 --> 00:30:52.073]  I'll listen to you the day I die or you go off air, but I'm going to do my part to make sure you don't.
[00:30:59.334 --> 00:31:07.576]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of stuff that's gone on.
[00:31:07.576 --> 00:31:08.977]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:31:08.977 --> 00:31:10.897]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[00:31:10.897 --> 00:31:13.117]  These products are incredible.
[00:31:13.117 --> 00:31:15.598]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:31.073]  All three of the Infowars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get three or four thousand bottles of each one of these.
[00:31:31.073 --> 00:31:35.495]  We've got four thousand bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:31:36.587 --> 00:31:43.832]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 testosterone boost that just came in, and we've got about 3,000 bottles of pain MD.
[00:31:43.832 --> 00:31:47.995]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:31:47.995 --> 00:31:54.580]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible, and they fund our operation at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:59.665 --> 00:32:04.106]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[00:32:04.106 --> 00:32:08.008]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[00:32:08.008 --> 00:32:12.609]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[00:32:12.609 --> 00:32:15.490]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.490]  I'll eat your ass!
[00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.291]  You Nazi scum!
[00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:22.952]  Let's free the Patriots and defeat the globalist tech geek!
[00:32:24.386 --> 00:32:28.935]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[00:32:28.935 --> 00:32:30.698]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.912]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:45.914]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist.
[00:32:45.914 --> 00:32:49.695]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[00:32:49.695 --> 00:33:01.681]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[00:33:01.681 --> 00:33:07.564]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.613 --> 00:33:14.969]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[00:33:22.328 --> 00:33:24.589]  He never gives up.
[00:33:24.589 --> 00:33:30.210]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.611]  Alright, I was there on January 6th, 2021, and I witnessed basically it all unfold.
[00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:36.832]  So it's not like I'm at a distance here talking about this.
[00:33:51.943 --> 00:34:13.817]  But almost three years later, what we originally thought happened that night when I broadcast for five, six hours, really pissed off from a rooftop up above where the media congregates, where we rented a slot for some outrageous, like $5,000 a day.
[00:34:20.373 --> 00:34:21.494]  And we said it was staged.
[00:34:21.494 --> 00:34:30.278]  There were feds, there were provocateurs, there were antifa, putting Trump gear, red, white, and blue outfits on, make America great again hats.
[00:34:30.278 --> 00:34:36.542]  You know Ray Absolo, you've seen it.
[00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:37.842]  We know what happened.
[00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:44.906]  Trump put on a big rally a mile and a half away at the Ellipse by the Washington Monument, in between the White House, the Washington Monument.
[00:34:49.048 --> 00:35:03.613]  Trump and his organization, because I was involved, had reserved the stage up on the corner top of the Capitol, right by the Supreme Court.
[00:35:03.613 --> 00:35:08.075]  And we were supposed to go there and have a peaceful rally, and Trump said, go there and be peaceful.
[00:35:08.075 --> 00:35:11.876]  But before Trump even started speaking, right as he began to speak,
[00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:21.677]  They had Antifa and feds dressed as Trump supporters began to hit the gates and yell at the police.
[00:35:21.677 --> 00:35:27.058]  And then about halfway through Trump's speech, they began to throw bottles and things at the police.
[00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:36.700]  The police started shooting tear gas canisters and pepper bullets.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.462]  at the crowd.
[00:35:40.462 --> 00:35:47.288]  And Ray Epps was there saying go in the Capitol and grabbing big signs and helping them ram over people.
[00:35:47.288 --> 00:35:53.093]  And yeah, folks got shot in the face with rubber bullets, you name it.
[00:35:53.093 --> 00:35:55.816]  So I got there, maybe 25% into it.
[00:36:00.253 --> 00:36:02.534]  And immediately got up on a stack of chairs.
[00:36:02.534 --> 00:36:07.056]  There were chairs folded with a big plastic wrapped around them, you know, waiting for the inauguration weeks later.
[00:36:07.056 --> 00:36:10.718]  And I climbed up on top, and everybody's seen the footage, said, don't go in.
[00:36:10.718 --> 00:36:11.758]  It's a setup.
[00:36:11.758 --> 00:36:18.722]  This will be a situation where people get shot and killed, like Kent State.
[00:36:18.722 --> 00:36:22.103]  Ashton Babbitt was shot about 45 minutes later.
[00:36:22.103 --> 00:36:25.125]  Cops threw people off the parapets.
[00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:26.605]  Four citizens were killed that day.
[00:36:26.605 --> 00:36:28.847]  A woman was beaten to death.
[00:36:28.847 --> 00:36:29.607]  No police were killed.
[00:36:30.879 --> 00:36:35.181]  And we were told this was as bad or worse than 9-11.
[00:36:35.181 --> 00:36:42.404]  Worse than 9-11, worse than Pearl Harbor by Chuckie Schumer and Kinzinger and just all the usual suspects.
[00:36:42.404 --> 00:36:47.066]  And then they didn't want to release any of the footage.
[00:36:47.066 --> 00:36:51.808]  A little bit of footage came out in the criminal trials that people were able to subpoena.
[00:36:51.808 --> 00:36:59.652]  And once Ray Epps and others in the lightly defended Capitol broke through the first barrier and then the second barrier,
[00:37:01.892 --> 00:37:07.576]  The police just opened the doors and then the people that were violent just disappeared.
[00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:11.099]  Ramps, everybody else just disappeared back in the crowd.
[00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:18.265]  And then everybody else being pushed forward by the crowd, like at a rock concert, up towards the stage, went through the door.
[00:37:18.265 --> 00:37:24.750]  And there's the first breach just now released by the new Speaker of the House, Jackson.
[00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.652]  Making good on his promise to release the 44,000 hours.
[00:37:29.724 --> 00:37:33.146]  They're putting it out as fast as they can, streaming it.
[00:37:33.146 --> 00:37:35.728]  They've already put out about 10% of it or so.
[00:37:35.728 --> 00:37:38.730]  Or a little bit less than 10% last time I checked.
[00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.491]  In a few weeks, it'll all be out.
[00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.313]  And the footage is damning.
[00:37:43.313 --> 00:37:44.814]  It's all over InfoWars.com.
[00:37:44.814 --> 00:37:45.555]  It's all over Twitter.
[00:37:45.555 --> 00:37:47.376]  A lot of you have already seen it.
[00:37:47.376 --> 00:37:48.797]  But let's move on now.
[00:37:48.797 --> 00:37:57.843]  So this is... And then once the people push through the main doors, all these other people who don't even know what's going on, they come in and take selfies with the cops and
[00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:08.531]  Walk through the velvet ropes like an old-fashioned movie theater.
[00:38:08.531 --> 00:38:15.656]  When you're going to the theater, you're going to your assigned theater to watch the movie you're going to see.
[00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:18.778]  And then the cue shaman gets up and says, let's all be peaceful.
[00:38:18.778 --> 00:38:19.739]  Let's not attack the police.
[00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:20.380]  It says a prayer.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.141]  Let's leave the Senate.
[00:38:24.537 --> 00:38:33.185]  And you remember many of these people, over a thousand, that just walked in and didn't touch a cop, didn't yell a cuss word, they're spending time in prison.
[00:38:33.185 --> 00:38:36.868]  The average is about two years.
[00:38:36.868 --> 00:38:45.536]  On the high end, it's 23 years in federal prison.
[00:38:45.536 --> 00:38:47.498]  And there's thousands of hours
[00:38:48.831 --> 00:38:49.591]  They've now been released.
[00:38:49.591 --> 00:38:59.535]  There's a lot of really creepy footage of they'll actually arrest somebody who's violent and you can see them pull something out of their bag or the cops pull it out and they go, oh, they let them out of their handcuffs.
[00:38:59.535 --> 00:39:00.135]  Yeah, right here.
[00:39:00.135 --> 00:39:03.076]  Because they're a cop.
[00:39:03.076 --> 00:39:06.678]  We have video of police, you know, tackling folks.
[00:39:06.678 --> 00:39:09.259]  Oh, I'm a I'm a D.C.
[00:39:09.259 --> 00:39:09.919]  police officer.
[00:39:09.919 --> 00:39:12.880]  It wasn't the Capitol Police that were in on it.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.700]  It was the D.C.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.080]  police.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.822]  A lot of them were in plain clothes and they would end up showing their badge.
[00:39:18.573 --> 00:39:19.394]  And they would release them.
[00:39:19.394 --> 00:39:21.015]  We have that on video.
[00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:23.878]  With audio, we have the new surveillance footage inside.
[00:39:23.878 --> 00:39:26.501]  Well, it's from a couple years ago, but it's new now.
[00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:29.804]  We're seeing it.
[00:39:29.804 --> 00:39:31.465]  So, the D.C.
[00:39:31.465 --> 00:39:40.253]  Police, the FBI, Antifa, and it looks like some of the think tanks and groups out there had their people there.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:47.644]  And they broke through, they sent half the Capitol Police away to deal with crowd control at the Ellipse.
[00:39:47.644 --> 00:39:52.208]  They refused Trump 10,000 National Guard, he asked four weeks before.
[00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:59.273]  Milley threatened to resign if Trump put National Guard on the streets for January 6th.
[00:39:59.273 --> 00:40:05.677]  This is all on record.
[00:40:05.677 --> 00:40:06.358]  And so now,
[00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:11.473]  We've got members of Congress calling for criminal investigations.
[00:40:11.473 --> 00:40:13.214]  Well, who do you go to for that?
[00:40:13.214 --> 00:40:14.755]  The Justice Department.
[00:40:14.755 --> 00:40:16.296]  The very people that ran the attacks.
[00:40:16.296 --> 00:40:21.700]  So breaking, House Speaker releases entire 44,000 hour January 6th footage.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.722]  The public watch new footage.
[00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:27.843]  Absolutely destroys Democrat January 6th insurrection.
[00:40:27.843 --> 00:40:31.506]  Narratives in a Don Salazar article from Friday that's got
[00:40:33.547 --> 00:40:37.871]  Thousands of hours posted on it with boil downs of the most important clips.
[00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:42.675]  So you want to go to that huge, look how thick this article is, like 30 pages long.
[00:40:42.675 --> 00:40:44.997]  You want to go to this article by Don Salazar.
[00:40:44.997 --> 00:40:48.960]  In fact, let's re-add that to the front page of InfoWars under the live show feed.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.883]  I know Jamie White's out there doing a great job.
[00:40:51.883 --> 00:40:55.306]  Add this under the live show feed, I'll link to this.
[00:40:55.306 --> 00:40:58.569]  So you don't have to spend 20 hours like we did going through it, you can just go see it.
[00:40:58.569 --> 00:41:01.071]  Or if you want to, surely go try to watch thousands of hours.
[00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:09.045]  Senator Mike Lee calls for investigation of January 6th panel following release of the footage.
[00:41:09.045 --> 00:41:10.186]  They got to see this.
[00:41:10.186 --> 00:41:16.812]  The January 6th committee that was created by Democrats and Republicans couldn't decide who was on it.
[00:41:16.812 --> 00:41:18.814]  They had a few hand-picked rhinos on it.
[00:41:18.814 --> 00:41:20.336]  They knew all this.
[00:41:20.336 --> 00:41:22.097]  No wonder they tried to keep it from being released.
[00:41:22.097 --> 00:41:24.079]  No wonder they had all the evidence.
[00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:26.742]  Their investigation destroyed when their committee ended.
[00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:32.889]  But not before it leaked that Ray Epps was in text messages saying, I orchestrated the attack.
[00:41:32.889 --> 00:41:34.330]  That data was family.
[00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:38.032]  Very proud man.
[00:41:38.032 --> 00:41:45.857]  Make America Great Again calls for January 6th committee to be jailed after Capitol building tapes reveal insurrection was really an inside job.
[00:41:45.857 --> 00:41:48.258]  Jamie White article, Infowars.com.
[00:41:48.258 --> 00:41:57.664]  Officer Bryant Williams identified as DC cop who pushed Trump supporter Derek Vargo off a three story ledge on January 6th, what appears to be attempted murder.
[00:42:01.348 --> 00:42:06.473]  Report FBI stopped investigation into pedo to probe January 6th suspects.
[00:42:06.473 --> 00:42:12.018]  Now he's accused of molesting a 10-year-old.
[00:42:12.018 --> 00:42:14.961]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:16.762]  Well, this is a big bottom line.
[00:42:16.762 --> 00:42:20.866]  So I'm gonna, you will definitely want to stay with us for the next segment.
[00:42:20.866 --> 00:42:23.288]  Because I'm gonna make an announcement right here on air today.
[00:42:23.288 --> 00:42:27.152]  Because no matter what they do to me or what they do to M4 Wars,
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:38.586]  We have important work to go in the future, but we've already served our main primary mission, as I've said before, but there's no putting Humpty Dumpty back together again here.
[00:42:38.586 --> 00:42:50.313]  We're running the tables against the Globalists, against BlackRock, and against G.G.Ping, and against Merrick Garland, and Jack Smith, and all of this scum.
[00:42:50.313 --> 00:42:54.615]  So, the whole world's turning against everything they say and do, and all the evidence is there.
[00:42:54.615 --> 00:42:55.536]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.282]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.

[00:44:59.335 --> 00:45:04.783]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[00:45:04.783 --> 00:45:14.617]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[00:45:15.798 --> 00:45:17.640]  I think so.
[00:45:39.162 --> 00:45:40.043]  We're good to go.
[00:45:59.204 --> 00:46:03.928]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:05.889]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:07.931]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:10.413]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:46:10.413 --> 00:46:11.233]  Hey, what's better?
[00:46:11.233 --> 00:46:12.074]  Knockout?
[00:46:12.074 --> 00:46:13.415]  What's better?
[00:46:13.415 --> 00:46:14.156]  Down and out?
[00:46:14.156 --> 00:46:14.696]  What's better?
[00:46:14.696 --> 00:46:16.958]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:21.882]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:46:22.566 --> 00:46:26.547]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:46:26.547 --> 00:46:27.868]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:46:27.868 --> 00:46:29.168]  They're all very diverse.
[00:46:29.168 --> 00:46:39.351]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.
[00:46:40.111 --> 00:46:45.735]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.

[00:47:01.747 --> 00:47:07.632]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.761 --> 00:47:43.559]  Riders on the storm Girl, you gotta love your man Take him by the hand Take him by the hand Make him understand Make him understand The world on you depends Our life don't ever end
[00:47:58.693 --> 00:48:05.838]  All right, I want to be infinity clear.
[00:48:05.838 --> 00:48:13.003]  I have tried to influence and get every organization and group on board for freedom.
[00:48:13.003 --> 00:48:23.069]  Whether they're Catholics, whether they're Jews, whether they're evangelical Christians, whether they're Buddhists, whether they're Hindus, whether they're agnostic, I really believe in humanity.
[00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:25.531]  And I understand the dialectic of manipulation that goes on.
[00:48:27.662 --> 00:48:31.004]  And clearly Israel stood down on October 7th.
[00:48:31.004 --> 00:48:32.685]  Who did it, we're not sure.
[00:48:32.685 --> 00:48:37.668]  Netanyahu saying the intelligence agencies, the military did it to get rid of him.
[00:48:37.668 --> 00:48:39.949]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:48:39.949 --> 00:48:43.852]  But definitely somebody stood down.
[00:48:43.852 --> 00:48:51.937]  And I see corporate media and the bots siding against Israel in a dialectic
[00:48:52.819 --> 00:49:01.804]  And the left allied with Islam and Hamas and Hezbollah, and you see all the leftist demonstrations and protests all over the world.
[00:49:01.804 --> 00:49:05.306]  I'm against the carpet bombing of Gaza.
[00:49:05.306 --> 00:49:16.693]  Jake Tapper has come out at a bunch of other CNN shows and literally said, Israel is an apartheid fascist state.
[00:49:16.693 --> 00:49:17.693]  You want to see the clips?
[00:49:17.693 --> 00:49:18.914]  Eight minutes long.
[00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:20.015]  Want to listen to Tapper that long?
[00:49:21.118 --> 00:49:23.279]  We'll play a little of it next hour.
[00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:26.401]  So, let's just pull back and get past emotions.
[00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:27.041]  I get it.
[00:49:27.041 --> 00:49:28.862]  Humans love to pick a side.
[00:49:28.862 --> 00:49:33.725]  And that's how we're designed to do, because you wouldn't survive in ancient times if you didn't.
[00:49:33.725 --> 00:49:37.927]  We're supposed to pick Israel or the Muslims.
[00:49:37.927 --> 00:49:41.509]  But the globalists are above that, manipulating something.
[00:49:41.509 --> 00:49:45.511]  The Israeli government stood down, allowed the attacks to take place,
[00:49:48.038 --> 00:49:55.160]  Even the Israeli news admits half the casualties were the Israeli troops going in once they showed up ten hours later.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.360]  They responded seven hours, but it took them hours to get going.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.761]  And they blew up a whole bunch of the houses that had hostages in them.
[00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:05.822]  And I'm not trying to attack Israel here.
[00:50:05.822 --> 00:50:12.623]  I'm saying we need to be honest about what's going on if we're going to be clear about this.
[00:50:12.623 --> 00:50:15.264]  This is a class of civilizations that's being created for a reason.
[00:50:19.724 --> 00:50:30.427]  And if you pull back from it, it's all part of what Klaus Schwab talked about, creating an angrier world and all these wars to bring in their world government.
[00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.808]  So I talked about this last week.
[00:50:32.808 --> 00:50:41.971]  They admit the insurance companies, around 20 million, it varies depending on the actuary, 18 to 21 million, 22 million have died from the shots.
[00:50:41.971 --> 00:50:43.691]  And I've got articles on it today.
[00:50:43.691 --> 00:50:45.112]  Incredible news.
[00:50:45.112 --> 00:50:46.512]  That's 20 million people.
[00:50:48.387 --> 00:50:51.988]  Another 80-something million starved to death from lockdowns.
[00:50:51.988 --> 00:51:03.571]  So I do care about the thousands of dead Palestinian children, and I care about the 1,500 dead Jews, and all the rest of it.
[00:51:03.571 --> 00:51:08.112]  But we're being told to care about this, and this is the only issue there is,
[00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:11.433]  When it is a distraction.
[00:51:11.433 --> 00:51:15.596]  Doesn't mean you don't care about it, but clearly it's a distraction.
[00:51:15.596 --> 00:51:26.064]  So there's a lot of cherry-picking from the show where I'm like, I want to tell Netanyahu and any Israelis, and it's members of the Knesset, that want to ship the Gaza people here.
[00:51:26.064 --> 00:51:29.967]  If they're so peaceful and loving and good, you need to take them in your country.
[00:51:29.967 --> 00:51:31.248]  Screw you if you want to do that.
[00:51:32.014 --> 00:51:34.235]  They go, look, Jones is now anti-Israel.
[00:51:34.235 --> 00:51:35.655]  Hallelujah, we're going to win.
[00:51:35.655 --> 00:51:40.317]  Once the Jews are destroyed, we're all going to be free from the river to the sea.
[00:51:40.317 --> 00:51:41.237]  You got the wrong guy.
[00:51:41.237 --> 00:51:44.398]  I'm not some Harvard globalist saying that.
[00:51:44.398 --> 00:51:50.620]  I'm pulling back as an adult and somebody trying to figure out what's going on and going, man, this looks really bad.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.121]  So when the Jews do atrocities, I show it.
[00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:55.422]  When the Islamists do it, I show it.
[00:51:55.422 --> 00:51:59.143]  I'm just here trying to call it like I see it.
[00:51:59.143 --> 00:51:59.763]  Balls and strikes.
[00:52:01.966 --> 00:52:12.596]  And it's not that I want to be like Switzerland, neutral.
[00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:16.160]  I know this is a larger game plan.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.842]  But here's the bigger takeaway.
[00:52:18.842 --> 00:52:24.908]  68% to 70% and a whole bunch of scientific polls of the American people are against what Israel is doing right now.
[00:52:27.034 --> 00:52:38.923]  And if you go on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, it's 90 to 10% the so-called vaunted Israeli propaganda network is being totally defeated.
[00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:41.585]  And that's because they want to get rid of Netanyahu.
[00:52:41.585 --> 00:52:47.330]  And so they're just sitting on their hands, folks.
[00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:52.874]  So this is a Jewish civil war that's being manipulated by globalists above it.
[00:52:53.942 --> 00:52:56.903]  To get Reddit and Netanyahu.
[00:52:56.903 --> 00:52:58.283]  But that's only at one level.
[00:52:58.283 --> 00:53:06.924]  The larger level, the crises, the terror attacks, the threats, the FBI director saying brace for Hamas terror attacks, which I think are going to come, whether they're manufactured or not.
[00:53:06.924 --> 00:53:12.965]  This is all about destabilization.
[00:53:12.965 --> 00:53:16.966]  So if people want simple-minded stuff, this is the wrong show.
[00:53:16.966 --> 00:53:22.627]  If you want fairness and real analysis and really trying to figure out what's going on, this is the show for you.
[00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:37.763]  But again, that said, whoever's right, whoever's wrong, whatever really is going on here, let me give you the bottom line.
[00:53:37.763 --> 00:53:42.487]  Mainstream media could say that oxygen is good for you, which it is.
[00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:43.428]  You gotta have it to live.
[00:53:43.428 --> 00:53:46.111]  You're dead in like four minutes without it.
[00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:49.894]  They could say mother's milk is good, oxygen's good.
[00:53:51.676 --> 00:54:00.058]  And the public hates the establishment so much, they would reject that.
[00:54:00.058 --> 00:54:12.761]  And so, whether it's Hollywood, or the corporations, the public knows you're bad, they've broken with you, and we're in a whole nother ballgame now.
[00:54:12.761 --> 00:54:20.143]  And there's people that understand the globalists, and their anti-human agenda, and are trying to fight that, build a pro-human agenda, and there's those that are
[00:54:21.229 --> 00:54:25.692]  Going along with the woke system.
[00:54:25.692 --> 00:54:34.577]  But the New World Order can do whatever it wants to do, release new viruses, try lockdowns, launch World War III.
[00:54:34.577 --> 00:54:35.798]  None of it's going to work.
[00:54:35.798 --> 00:54:37.299]  They're done.
[00:54:37.299 --> 00:54:43.002]  This corrupt establishment is over.
[00:54:43.002 --> 00:54:48.465]  And they wanted to collapse the world and bring in their world government, collapse the old system and bring themselves in.
[00:54:48.465 --> 00:54:50.787]  Instead, because we identified the globalists,
[00:54:51.843 --> 00:54:58.427]  As being the authors of this, they've destroyed themselves, and they still can't figure it out.
[00:54:58.427 --> 00:55:20.142]  They've got all these yes-men and all these yes-women and all these minions ready to sell out their mother for a stick of bubblegum, ready to kill their grandma for a dollar, and there's a real vacuum here, and people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, they figure that out, so they're now jumped to our side, because they know that's where 90% of people are at.
[00:55:20.142 --> 00:55:20.903]  And that's okay.
[00:55:21.994 --> 00:55:25.968]  We knew that would happen, but we don't just need people jumping over to our side.
[00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:36.872]  We need people jumping over to understanding the larger globalist agenda and how to build an alternate agenda to counter that and to have a civilization and to have humanity continue.
[00:55:36.872 --> 00:55:44.836]  Because you've all know Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates have decided you're all garbage to be taken out and gotten rid of.
[00:55:44.836 --> 00:55:54.922]  The main thrust is saying no to that and identifying that and not letting a Ukraine war or an Israel war be a distraction from the big picture.
[00:55:56.311 --> 00:56:11.366]  Because they are giving people, whether you live in Venezuela, or Canada, or Germany, or Japan, or South Africa, poison shots that give you heart attacks.
[00:56:11.366 --> 00:56:14.789]  And they've got PR TV programs in Germany and Canada.
[00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:16.051]  I've got the news clips here.
[00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:16.871]  I'll show them next hour.
[00:56:17.776 --> 00:56:21.657]  They're like, hey, it's normal for five-year-olds to have heart attacks.
[00:56:21.657 --> 00:56:24.338]  We're here to help you when your son or daughter has a heart attack.
[00:56:24.338 --> 00:56:26.399]  It's normal for 15-year-olds to have heart attacks.
[00:56:26.399 --> 00:56:27.559]  It's the new normal.
[00:56:27.559 --> 00:56:30.300]  They're literally propagandizing.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:34.561]  Why would they do something like that?
[00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:41.003]  Whether you're in Singapore or Israel, whether you're in Jordan or whether you're in France,
[00:56:41.926 --> 00:56:42.207]  We're good.
[00:56:54.361 --> 00:57:03.465]  Three billion people with shots that they know in many cases are going to cause blood clots, heart swelling, heart attacks, strokes.
[00:57:03.465 --> 00:57:09.608]  I mean, instead of just 24-7, we got 10,000 Palestinians dead.
[00:57:09.608 --> 00:57:10.668]  Okay, great.
[00:57:10.668 --> 00:57:11.969]  Let's be proportionate.
[00:57:11.969 --> 00:57:12.529]  Let's spend
[00:57:13.909 --> 00:57:19.834]  One one hundredth of our time on that, and then 90% of our time on the 20 million dead.
[00:57:19.834 --> 00:57:21.235]  See what I'm saying?
[00:57:21.235 --> 00:57:25.278]  Let's be scientific and proportionate.
[00:57:25.278 --> 00:57:40.770]  Because whoever's running this, whoever's doing this, and we know who they are actually, literally are depopulating us and injecting us with prion crystals that grow in our bodies and slowly kill us.
[00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:42.251]  I mean, that's the big takeaway.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.802]  So, hour number two straight ahead.
[00:57:45.802 --> 00:57:49.365]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:57.631]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on.
[00:57:57.631 --> 00:57:59.012]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:57:59.012 --> 00:58:00.934]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[00:58:00.934 --> 00:58:03.156]  These products are incredible.
[00:58:03.156 --> 00:58:05.658]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:21.109]  All three of the Infowars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get three or four thousand bottles of each one of these.
[00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:25.532]  We've got four thousand bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:58:26.604 --> 00:58:33.867]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 testosterone boost that just came in, and we've got about 3,000 bottles of pain MD.
[00:58:33.867 --> 00:58:38.028]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.

[01:00:04.138 --> 01:00:06.759]  I've got some big news for you video game fans out there.
[01:00:06.759 --> 01:00:12.222]  And even if you're like me and you don't really play video games, the last console I owned was a Sega Saturn.
[01:00:12.222 --> 01:00:13.763]  Go ahead, laugh, kids.
[01:00:13.763 --> 01:00:14.804]  Call me a boomer.
[01:00:14.804 --> 01:00:16.344]  I just lost interest in video games.
[01:00:16.344 --> 01:00:18.185]  I'm more of a book nerd myself.
[01:00:18.185 --> 01:00:24.669]  But I think we can all agree that this new video game from Alex Jones looks fantastic.
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:31.111]  First, there was Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[01:00:31.111 --> 01:00:37.532]  And now, we give you the ultimate politically incorrect game, Alex Jones New Wars.
[01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:44.613]  I had to bleep that, by the way, because the term, UNE ERLDEWEY ORDERWEY, is not allowed on YouTube anymore.
[01:00:44.613 --> 01:00:49.234]  They consider that to be a dangerous conspiracy theory.
[01:00:49.234 --> 01:00:51.575]  They're turning the friggin' drums again!
[01:00:51.575 --> 01:00:52.515]  You Nazi scum!
[01:00:53.368 --> 01:01:00.094]  That is George Soros as one of the apparent final bosses of one of the episodes.
[01:01:00.094 --> 01:01:02.175]  I think we all know what that building is, right?
[01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:07.139]  On Bill Clinton's favorite island, which is literally one of the levels in the game.
[01:01:07.139 --> 01:01:14.365]  Download it now at AlexJonesGames.com because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:21.949]  If you go to AlexJonesGame.com, it says that it's available on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices.
[01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:27.352]  But when I looked in the Apple App Store, I didn't see it, so maybe it already got banned?
[01:01:27.352 --> 01:01:30.754]  I don't think you can sideload games on iOS devices.
[01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:36.997]  I thought they all had to come from the App Store, but I could be wrong, or maybe you could play it directly through the website, I'm not sure.
[01:01:37.637 --> 01:01:40.259]  But this is fantastic!
[01:01:40.259 --> 01:01:46.122]  And aside from featuring George Soros, it looks like Mark Zuckerberg is also one of the final bosses.
[01:01:46.122 --> 01:01:52.026]  And there's Hillary Clinton, who's keeping a bunch of babies, as you can see, in cages.
[01:01:52.026 --> 01:01:58.489]  So far, the only media outlets that I have found that have reported on the game have been reputable media outlets.
[01:01:58.489 --> 01:02:00.631]  So, of course, they are few and far between.
[01:02:01.631 --> 01:02:16.443]  Only two of them so far, the Post Millennial, which is a great website, and not the Babylon Bee, but they also have an actual news website of news that seems like it's so crazy that it might be satire, and it's called Not the Bee.
[01:02:16.443 --> 01:02:20.026]  And so they published this article just in time for Christmas.
[01:02:20.026 --> 01:02:21.968]  It's the Alex Jones video game.
[01:02:21.968 --> 01:02:24.510]  I can't believe how hilarious and fun this looks.
[01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:36.964]  The person writing the article says, I'll be up front here, I have never in my life listened to Alex Jones, and yet somehow I recognize every one of the references in this game.
[01:02:36.964 --> 01:02:39.788]  Which reminds me, a lot of people think that when Alex got banned from
[01:02:40.253 --> 01:02:46.978]  YouTube, Twitter, every other social media platform, that he just shut down, that his show just ceased to exist.
[01:02:46.978 --> 01:02:53.923]  But if you're an old school listener like me, who by the way has been a regular guest on his show since 2005 for 18 years, literally,
[01:02:57.505 --> 01:03:05.327]  I have had Influencers.com bookmarked on my browser for longer than that even since I think 2004.
[01:03:05.327 --> 01:03:23.270]  Then you would know that you could just go there and live stream his show and click on the band.video link up there at the top and then that takes you to his archive of his shows and his clips and the other shows and other hosts which is basically like his own personal YouTube.
[01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:31.178]  And just a few days ago when I was watching the show over on, ahem, The Undone Video, I got very sad after seeing this segment.
[01:03:31.178 --> 01:03:36.423]  If they're able to not have me pay the bills, and the judge said he's not budging on this, that's the plan.
[01:03:38.499 --> 01:03:41.481]  Then they're going to shut this down as early as January.
[01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:46.443]  And then there'll be about a three-month wind-down, and then I'll be on air, and people are like, oh, here's millions.
[01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:49.565]  No, no, no, don't shut down when I give you a date.
[01:03:49.565 --> 01:03:51.326]  And by then, it's been triggered.
[01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:51.986]  It's been set.
[01:03:51.986 --> 01:03:53.287]  It's been pulled back.
[01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:56.088]  Now, I'll be able to go somewhere else and do a show, and I won't go away.
[01:03:56.088 --> 01:03:59.550]  But for the crew and this infrastructure, it'll be seen as a victory for the enemy.
[01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.472]  And of course, it'll blow up their face, make what I do bigger.
[01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.533]  It's just, I think InfoWars should stick around.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.804]  He's talking about the bankruptcy, which is a reorganization bankruptcy, not a shutdown bankruptcy.
[01:04:10.804 --> 01:04:17.570]  But because of all the legal bills he's had to pay over the last five years, he's having a hard time paying his regular bills.
[01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:27.218]  And if he's not able to do that, then the judge who's overseeing the reorganization is going to rule that everything has to be shut down and sold off to satisfy those payments.
[01:04:27.418 --> 01:04:50.348]  And that would have happened by now if it weren't for, like I said yesterday, a Bitcoin donation that somebody gave him last year of $8 million that made the entire liberal media industrial complex and the Southern Poverty Law Center air, as you can see, absolutely furious, dubbed the Bitcoin Fairy, who is obviously an Alex Jones superfan who probably has
[01:04:51.648 --> 01:04:53.930]  Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
[01:04:53.930 --> 01:05:00.315]  Somebody who bought thousands of them a decade ago when they were just a few dollars.
[01:05:00.315 --> 01:05:12.585]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[01:05:12.585 --> 01:05:18.410]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:20.612]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[01:05:21.492 --> 01:05:23.814]  What we can do is be prepared.
[01:05:23.814 --> 01:05:32.939]  And you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.
[01:05:32.939 --> 01:05:36.381]  And you can share the videos at Band.Video.
[01:05:36.381 --> 01:05:42.124]  Our best hope still is and always has been a mass awakening.
[01:05:42.124 --> 01:05:43.385]  So download the videos.
[01:05:44.185 --> 01:05:48.468]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[01:05:48.468 --> 01:05:55.032]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[01:05:55.032 --> 01:06:10.582]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.052 --> 01:06:30.394]  All right, I've talked about this for a few weeks, but I haven't plunged into it and I haven't covered it.
[01:06:30.394 --> 01:06:33.554]  And so we're gonna do it right now.
[01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:46.857]  More than a hundred years ago, a little more than a hundred years ago, there was what they called a Carrington event, where a solar flare hit the earth when it was rotated towards the sun in the Americas.
[01:06:46.857 --> 01:06:48.938]  And telegraph wires
[01:06:51.147 --> 01:06:55.288]  Heated up red hot and melted across the United States.
[01:06:55.288 --> 01:07:02.830]  And the few areas that had power in the United States, the transformers blew up and were put into darkness.
[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:14.514]  Now, the reason I raise that is that there's been major pre-programming for a decade, but it's been accelerating.
[01:07:14.514 --> 01:07:15.534]  And Klaus Schwab has said,
[01:07:17.708 --> 01:07:35.082]  That an internet outage, a major cyber attack, like let's get that club, Slob talks about cyber attack, it's everywhere, is imminent and that it'll make COVID and the lockdowns look tame in comparison.
[01:07:36.715 --> 01:07:42.840]  Well, the globalists want to crash the old system, bring in the new central bank digital currencies, the ESGs.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.382]  Their old bubble is imploding right now.
[01:07:45.382 --> 01:07:52.448]  They need to pose as the saviors and have a war, race wars, crises, as the excuse to bring it in.
[01:07:52.448 --> 01:07:53.629]  And they admit that.
[01:07:53.629 --> 01:07:59.995]  They say we can use a virus, we can use a power outage, we can use a cyber attack, we could use an alien invasion.
[01:07:59.995 --> 01:08:00.955]  I mean, they all say this.
[01:08:00.955 --> 01:08:01.456]  We've covered it.
[01:08:02.881 --> 01:08:04.943]  To bring this in.
[01:08:04.943 --> 01:08:05.663]  Yeah, they found the clip.
[01:08:05.663 --> 01:08:06.004]  There it is.
[01:08:06.004 --> 01:08:09.387]  We'll play it in a minute.
[01:08:09.387 --> 01:08:14.251]  So they've been pre-programming this for a decade at least.
[01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:15.892]  Heavily.
[01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:21.878]  And now the last year it's reached bonkers level preparation.
[01:08:21.878 --> 01:08:25.581]  Like how do I know when Ford a few years ago was going to put out a Bronco again?
[01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:26.822]  There were damn ads everywhere.
[01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:33.119]  Back in the 80s when Coke was going to have a new Cherry Coke, six months of Cherry Coke, Cherry Coke's coming.
[01:08:33.119 --> 01:08:38.202]  You know when the new thing's coming because they're everywhere telling you about it.
[01:08:38.202 --> 01:08:44.305]  Once you're conscious and not subconsciously just receiving the stuff, it's as clear as day.
[01:08:47.079 --> 01:09:01.889]  So I said two years ago, we've played the clips more than two years ago, I said, I think they're going to claim right wingers working with Russia are going to hack the cyber system and bring down the power grid, at least partially.
[01:09:01.889 --> 01:09:08.813]  So they've got to bring an internet ID and only send you to websites they control, which is the internet kill switch Obama put in.
[01:09:08.813 --> 01:09:09.854]  Deep research goes into this.
[01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:25.459]  And then sure enough, earlier this year, six months ago, FBI memos, right-wingers working for Russia, with no proof, just like Trump's a Russian agent, or I'm a Russian agent, with no proof, are going to hack the grid.
[01:09:25.459 --> 01:09:32.384]  Now, if you really wanted to get the grid, there's less than 220 points, like 215, 18 points.
[01:09:32.384 --> 01:09:39.190]  You could shoot up the Transformers, which we don't want to happen, we're not saying do that, and they don't have backup Transformers,
[01:09:40.538 --> 01:09:41.818]  Which they should have on site.
[01:09:41.818 --> 01:09:44.339]  Congress has had a bunch of hearings and commissions on it.
[01:09:44.339 --> 01:10:01.082]  For like $3 billion, they could have backup transformers there ready, or they could have hardened the transformers even cheaper, put, you know, steel walls up around it, lead walls as well to stop a Carrington event, a solar flare, for another billion.
[01:10:01.082 --> 01:10:08.163]  So, like $5 billion, less than $5 billion, you could protect them or have backups ready that could be hooked up in a few days.
[01:10:09.215 --> 01:10:10.516]  The power goes off.
[01:10:10.516 --> 01:10:23.087]  The Pentagon estimates in major strategic reports, they've done a bunch, that 90% of people on average would be dead within one year if the power stayed off.
[01:10:23.087 --> 01:10:28.452]  And there's no backup plan with just a little simple warehouse next to these 215, 16 sites.
[01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:32.295]  Some experts are 250 sites, but most experts say it's like less than 230 sites.
[01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:41.018]  You should have a warehouse right there.
[01:10:41.018 --> 01:10:48.500]  You drive down the highway, you see these big transformers and wires and these big machines and all the electrodes and everything.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:53.822]  That equipment blows up from a solar flare or people machine gunning it.
[01:10:53.822 --> 01:10:56.703]  They don't have backups.
[01:10:56.703 --> 01:10:58.784]  They've not ordered backups.
[01:10:58.784 --> 01:11:01.125]  Maybe there's a few, but nothing like they need.
[01:11:01.125 --> 01:11:04.706]  Then they gotta load them on trucks, on big, you know, extra-wide
[01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:09.090]  Eighteen wheelers and drive them there and hook them up.
[01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.610]  They should be on site.
[01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:24.432]  I think, as much money as they spend, this is so critical, they should harden them and have a warehouse at every facility, or at least another facility close by, that has all the key transformers.
[01:11:24.432 --> 01:11:27.173]  I mean, these things are the size of, like, two-story buildings.
[01:11:27.173 --> 01:11:33.174]  This isn't like a transformer in your neighborhood that's, you know, two feet tall and a foot wide and, you know, somebody shoots that.
[01:11:33.954 --> 01:11:42.082]  It blows up, your power goes off, and your power's off for a day, and the power company gets there, they go up there, they remove it, they put a new one in.
[01:11:42.082 --> 01:11:43.343]  These are the big giant ones.
[01:11:43.343 --> 01:11:50.169]  Some of them are two stories tall.
[01:11:50.169 --> 01:11:55.935]  You pump a few magazines of even 9mm into those, they're gonna blow up.
[01:11:57.128 --> 01:11:59.430]  You shoot one of them, and I'm all for .50 cals.
[01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:03.872]  There's only been one crime committed with a .50 cal in the 80s, an armored truck robbery.
[01:12:03.872 --> 01:12:07.455]  The feds don't want to ban them.
[01:12:07.455 --> 01:12:16.301]  But no, with a .50 caliber rifle, a couple shots, you knock one out.
[01:12:16.301 --> 01:12:20.223]  But again, you could drive a truck through and ram it into it if you're a jihadi.
[01:12:20.223 --> 01:12:21.544]  There's no stopping it.
[01:12:21.544 --> 01:12:25.847]  You've got to have backups down the road, and you've got to harden them.
[01:12:28.395 --> 01:12:37.818]  It's easy, put a big steel wall around it, and if you want to stop a Carrington event, a solar flare, you put, skip the break coming up, you put lead on it as well.
[01:12:37.818 --> 01:12:41.579]  This is a quarter inch of lead, Congress study said.
[01:12:41.579 --> 01:12:43.040]  Cheap.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.041]  Five billion dollars.
[01:12:46.041 --> 01:12:48.241]  You got lead and steel backing.
[01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:51.882]  Three billion, you get steel.
[01:12:51.882 --> 01:12:56.264]  So, this is the real Achilles heel.
[01:12:57.358 --> 01:13:03.440]  And the globalists want a post-industrial world under Agenda 2030.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:13.363]  And they're telling you it's coming, and they're telling you that the right-wingers, in all these headlines, just type in, right-wing Trump supporters attacking power stations.
[01:13:13.363 --> 01:13:14.803]  They've arrested no one.
[01:13:14.803 --> 01:13:16.083]  They have no proof.
[01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:17.964]  No one knows who's already done tests.
[01:13:17.964 --> 01:13:19.685]  They've blown up dozens of them.
[01:13:19.685 --> 01:13:21.005]  They've already hit the key sites.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:28.501]  And they're telling you, just like I predicted, that you could ask, well, did you give them the idea?
[01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:30.342]  No, I didn't give them the idea.
[01:13:30.342 --> 01:13:34.523]  I know how they operate.
[01:13:34.523 --> 01:13:45.906]  So, by the way, in Russia, they have underground bunkers for their entire 200 million plus population.
[01:13:45.906 --> 01:13:47.106]  We have no bunkers here for us.
[01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:57.980]  In Russia, I was looking it up, they have their main power transformers shielded, and they have backups nearby.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.101]  And Russia's not one-tenth as rich as us.
[01:14:01.101 --> 01:14:08.004]  Why has our ruling class decided not to harden the key power junctures?
[01:14:08.004 --> 01:14:10.565]  Because there's six major power grids around the country.
[01:14:10.565 --> 01:14:12.987]  Guys, pull up a schematic of U.S.
[01:14:12.987 --> 01:14:13.607]  power grids.
[01:14:14.679 --> 01:14:15.259]  Just click images.
[01:14:15.259 --> 01:14:17.161]  It'll show you six grids.
[01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:18.241]  Texas is the biggest grid.
[01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:20.083]  We supply like seven states.
[01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:22.364]  We're the best grid.
[01:14:22.364 --> 01:14:28.188]  The feds have been attacking that regulatorily, trying to shut down its expansion, trying to shut down the coal to it.
[01:14:28.188 --> 01:14:31.970]  I mean, you know, shutting down the damn pipelines to it.
[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:35.233]  So, they're the ones shutting down the pipelines.
[01:14:35.233 --> 01:14:37.414]  They're the ones saying they want a post-industrial world.
[01:14:37.414 --> 01:14:40.436]  And then they're literally saying Trump supporters?
[01:14:40.436 --> 01:14:41.717]  Can you imagine a Trump supporter?
[01:14:43.456 --> 01:15:01.744]  On average lowest crime rate, good hard working person, is going to get in their pickup truck or their SUV and they're going to drive down and they're going to even find out where the big relay center is in their area, one of these 200 plus.
[01:15:03.297 --> 01:15:09.779]  And then they're going to get out and shoot bullets into it to cut power off.
[01:15:09.779 --> 01:15:11.999]  That's the opposite of a Trump supporter.
[01:15:11.999 --> 01:15:14.220]  The left wants the power cut off.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.140]  They're banning gas-powered stoves, for heaven's sake.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.861]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:22.001]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:23.262]  Memoring.
[01:15:23.262 --> 01:15:24.302]  Six power grids.
[01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:38.108]  The C-A-I-S-O, the M-I-S-O, the I-S-O dash M-E, the P-J-M, the S-P-P, the ERCOT.
[01:15:38.108 --> 01:15:43.029]  And ERCOT, if you actually study it, funds the S-P-P.
[01:15:43.029 --> 01:15:44.449]  So I told you six states.
[01:15:44.449 --> 01:15:47.270]  One, two, three, four, five, six, yeah.
[01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:51.350]  Really seven technically.
[01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:54.171]  Because the Texas grid powers that yellow grid right there.
[01:15:56.633 --> 01:16:01.774]  But ERCOT's globalist too.
[01:16:01.774 --> 01:16:07.216]  So see, the average person, you think Hannity knows the six power grids.
[01:16:07.216 --> 01:16:11.077]  And I'm not a fancy pants here.
[01:16:11.077 --> 01:16:13.317]  I study what the enemy's saying.
[01:16:13.317 --> 01:16:17.078]  Oh, your grid's going to go down and Trump supporters are going to blow it up.
[01:16:17.078 --> 01:16:18.499]  And I'm sitting there going, really?
[01:16:18.499 --> 01:16:24.060]  Trump supporters want jobs and industry and factories and farms and families.
[01:16:27.176 --> 01:16:29.677]  And they got a few of these little fake busts.
[01:16:29.677 --> 01:16:35.058]  Oh, the Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson plot to blow up the power grid.
[01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:37.718]  Come on, people.
[01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:40.579]  So they pre-programmed this.
[01:16:40.579 --> 01:16:42.699]  They've got this ready.
[01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:46.700]  They've brainwashed people for it about to happen.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:54.342]  And when they do it, oh, sorry, we have to shut down the grid because they're not going to attack it, I believe, physically.
[01:16:55.967 --> 01:16:57.188]  Because that's too hard to fix.
[01:16:57.188 --> 01:17:06.373]  No, they're going to cyber it and say we did it, and then say we've got to kill the main internet to only redirect everybody to trusted websites, which they've already proposed.
[01:17:06.373 --> 01:17:07.893]  I'm not postulating this.
[01:17:07.893 --> 01:17:09.154]  They've proposed it.
[01:17:09.154 --> 01:17:16.278]  That, oh, when the right wing with Putin cuts off the US power, imagine how pissed people will be.
[01:17:17.861 --> 01:17:30.991]  We're only going to send you to websites that are trusted because we can't let you go to other websites or the internet because you, because the Russians are attacking the power grid with the Trump supporters.
[01:17:30.991 --> 01:17:36.014]  And I just laid 15 Martian babies during the break.
[01:17:36.014 --> 01:17:36.935]  And I lay eggs.
[01:17:36.935 --> 01:17:40.698]  I mean, it's, it's, it's absolute horseman-er.
[01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:58.917]  So why hasn't our government hardened the PowerPoints and why are they now saying imminent attacks by Trump supporters are imminent against the power grid?
[01:17:58.917 --> 01:18:00.958]  Because they're getting ready to do it.
[01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:03.680]  There's not even a discussion of that analysis.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.961]  You know, it's true.
[01:18:04.961 --> 01:18:08.463]  It's obvious to you.
[01:18:08.463 --> 01:18:11.785]  So what do we do about it?
[01:18:11.785 --> 01:18:11.985]  See,
[01:18:13.373 --> 01:18:17.036]  They don't just need to kill Trump or put him in jail.
[01:18:17.036 --> 01:18:20.999]  They're getting ready to turn the power off.
[01:18:20.999 --> 01:18:22.741]  And I'm going to feel real sad when this happens.
[01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:24.602]  If it does, a good chance it will.
[01:18:24.602 --> 01:18:32.149]  But I'll be kind of like, well, like Yoda at the end of episode three, when he says, failed have I.
[01:18:33.404 --> 01:18:34.964]  Because I'm done at that point.
[01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:36.365]  This stuff's off.
[01:18:36.365 --> 01:18:37.505]  We're off the air.
[01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:39.606]  I'll be worried about food for my family.
[01:18:39.606 --> 01:18:44.988]  And I'm really pissed at myself, quite frankly, that I'm not spending more time just getting that ready.
[01:18:44.988 --> 01:18:46.608]  But I'm like, no, don't be a wimp.
[01:18:46.608 --> 01:18:47.808]  Stay at the post.
[01:18:47.808 --> 01:18:49.329]  We can stop this together.
[01:18:49.329 --> 01:18:51.470]  You know, the American people just work hard.
[01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:52.750]  Expose it, Jones.
[01:18:52.750 --> 01:19:02.293]  But day after day, I'm just like, man, every day I'm like, I need to just get natural gas and fertilizer and seeds and just move to the ranch with my dad and just
[01:19:02.773 --> 01:19:06.679]  Because, I mean, this is going down, folks.
[01:19:06.679 --> 01:19:11.866]  This is going down.
[01:19:11.866 --> 01:19:14.710]  I legitimately believe they're probably going to pull this.
[01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:17.835]  Now, here's an example out of the clips.
[01:19:23.769 --> 01:19:33.633]  I got a call back in August by a good friend of mine, I've known him 20-something years, and they said, hey, will you meet with me for a cup of coffee?
[01:19:33.633 --> 01:19:34.494]  And I said, yeah, what's about?
[01:19:34.494 --> 01:19:36.314]  I want to meet with you.
[01:19:36.314 --> 01:19:47.259]  So I went in and got a little blueberry muffin and coffee at the Starbucks and sat down and he came in and he said, yeah, they told us start next month, they're going to start phasing in the COVID protocols again.
[01:19:47.259 --> 01:19:50.280]  And at the end of the winter, they're going to bring them all back.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.941]  And we just think it's BS and you should know about it.
[01:19:52.406 --> 01:19:53.587]  So I brought that out.
[01:19:53.587 --> 01:19:54.427]  Everybody got upset.
[01:19:54.427 --> 01:19:55.688]  We put heat on it.
[01:19:55.688 --> 01:20:00.611]  And then they tried to bring the COVID protocols back, but because we were aware of it, we were able to back it off.
[01:20:00.611 --> 01:20:08.835]  Except in Germany and in Australia this week, they announced they're bringing back the mask and COVID protocols.
[01:20:08.835 --> 01:20:10.236]  They're still doing it.
[01:20:10.236 --> 01:20:10.996]  They can't help it.
[01:20:10.996 --> 01:20:14.839]  It's the same worldwide, run by the UN, run by Bill Gates.
[01:20:14.839 --> 01:20:16.920]  Yeah, there's Australian TV right there.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.200]  Friday.
[01:20:19.318 --> 01:20:20.880]  And notice the media spun it.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.502]  Oh, Jones is wrong!
[01:20:22.502 --> 01:20:24.964]  They said they'd bring the protocols back by mid-September.
[01:20:24.964 --> 01:20:26.286]  I said they start rolling them out.
[01:20:26.286 --> 01:20:27.627]  I said we could stop them.
[01:20:27.627 --> 01:20:32.553]  But they're still doing it in zones they control, and Bill Gates is praising them for what they've done.
[01:20:35.211 --> 01:20:42.716]  So the message here is we're not just here like spectators watching a football game that just watch this.
[01:20:42.716 --> 01:20:44.377]  We can change this.
[01:20:44.377 --> 01:20:45.478]  We can do something.
[01:20:45.478 --> 01:21:02.970]  But the UN and the World Economic Forum and the FBI says the Trump supporters are going and are blowing up, listen to this, the power grid and going to hack it because they want Trump.
[01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:04.331]  Trump's 20 points ahead of Biden.
[01:21:07.305 --> 01:21:09.246]  What would blowing up the power grid do?
[01:21:09.246 --> 01:21:12.327]  So people can't vote on the voting machines to elect him?
[01:21:12.327 --> 01:21:14.268]  This is ridiculous.
[01:21:14.268 --> 01:21:16.449]  But this is how desperate they are.
[01:21:16.449 --> 01:21:19.570]  And I just ask the average police officer, or FBI agent, or anybody out there.
[01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:23.451]  I know you're compartmentalized, but is this really where you want to go?
[01:21:23.451 --> 01:21:28.113]  Because this is where we're going.
[01:21:28.113 --> 01:21:32.114]  So I want to shift gears now to the report by Greg Rees.
[01:21:32.114 --> 01:21:34.555]  Getting out the politics and just looking at the reality.
[01:21:36.531 --> 01:21:44.135]  Largest evidence, latest evidence points to, latest evidence points to magnetic disaster.
[01:21:44.135 --> 01:21:46.276]  And the poles are moving.
[01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:48.557]  And they're claiming it's going to be a solar flare.
[01:21:48.557 --> 01:21:50.098]  But is it a pole shift?
[01:21:50.098 --> 01:21:51.578]  Why are they trying to depopulate?
[01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:53.459]  Why are they trying to get a grid in control?
[01:21:53.459 --> 01:22:02.904]  Why are they trying to act like, remember they sent Captain Kirk a couple years ago up on
[01:22:04.212 --> 01:22:08.854]  Jeff Bezos' spaceship, and he came back and he said, too bad the cataclysm's about to happen.
[01:22:08.854 --> 01:22:10.655]  You're about to all die.
[01:22:10.655 --> 01:22:15.737]  It's so sad, and we're like, what does that mean?
[01:22:15.737 --> 01:22:22.200]  Whatever it is, whether they're orchestrating it or whether they know it's coming, they believe the end of the world's coming, folks.
[01:22:23.407 --> 01:22:24.828]  Will they blow the power grid?
[01:22:24.828 --> 01:22:26.248]  Will they hack the grid?
[01:22:26.248 --> 01:22:28.829]  Will they attack us with nukes and say it's asteroids?
[01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:30.630]  Do they know something's coming?
[01:22:30.630 --> 01:22:32.091]  Why don't they try to stop it?
[01:22:32.091 --> 01:22:33.831]  We can launch missiles to stop it.
[01:22:33.831 --> 01:22:36.412]  I don't know, but you can feel it, folks.
[01:22:36.412 --> 01:22:39.874]  Something big's going down.
[01:22:39.874 --> 01:22:46.816]  And we all know it's not Trump supporters, for God's sakes, that are going to be attacking the power grid with the Russians.
[01:22:46.816 --> 01:22:47.817]  Here's Greg Reese's report.
[01:22:55.509 --> 01:23:03.951]  During an interview with Patrick Bet-David, Raytheon whistleblower Eric Hecker reveals that he is likely an unwitting asset for the CIA.
[01:23:03.951 --> 01:23:05.872]  But you're saying you've never been involved with the CIA?
[01:23:05.872 --> 01:23:07.512]  You've not done anything with the CIA?
[01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:09.393]  That's not something you've done in the past before?
[01:23:09.393 --> 01:23:15.295]  I've never been directly employed by any of those companies, alphabet agencies, however you want to title them.
[01:23:15.295 --> 01:23:19.596]  But having looked backwards, I question
[01:23:20.476 --> 01:23:23.257]  The proximity that I was to them.
[01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:31.460]  I may have been some sort of unknown asset, but I can tell you that certainly I was involved in peculiar activities 24 hours a day.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:43.925]  There were certain clients that could call me 24 hours a day, and these clients would dictate when I met them, what vehicle I showed up with, which mansion we were going to.
[01:23:43.925 --> 01:23:45.906]  Are these names we would recognize?
[01:23:45.906 --> 01:23:47.247]  John Tunney was one of them.
[01:23:48.217 --> 01:23:50.438]  Owner of the Carlyle Group.
[01:23:50.438 --> 01:23:51.378]  Familiar with the Carlyle Group?
[01:23:51.378 --> 01:23:52.678]  Of course I am, yes.
[01:23:52.678 --> 01:23:57.240]  I did a lot of peculiar work for the Carlyle Group and their facilities and their personnel.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.681]  So, unpack peculiar work.
[01:24:00.681 --> 01:24:02.241]  What does that mean?
[01:24:02.241 --> 01:24:05.342]  I would say that I was set up as some sort of getaway driver.
[01:24:05.342 --> 01:24:06.823]  Getaway driver from what?
[01:24:06.823 --> 01:24:08.603]  Whatever he was doing in that mansion.
[01:24:08.603 --> 01:24:13.424]  Did you ever see anything weird where you're like, this is kind of weird what they're working on?
[01:24:13.424 --> 01:24:14.865]  I think I saw that all the time.
[01:24:15.506 --> 01:24:22.251]  Through his billionaire handlers, Hecker was sent to Antarctica as a plumber and given full security access.
[01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:36.261]  He claims to have seen directed energy weapons that are capable of creating earthquakes and seems unaware of the obvious that he was sent there by his billionaire handlers to do exactly what he's doing now, saying that the government is creating earthquakes.
[01:24:37.543 --> 01:24:45.348]  It's interesting to note that even though they happen constantly and are often devastating, there is no official public earthquake reporting.
[01:24:45.348 --> 01:24:52.493]  The Dutch Sense channel on YouTube stands out as the premier source for up-to-date earthquake information.
[01:24:52.493 --> 01:25:03.741]  For over a decade, Michael Janich has been using USGS data made available to the public and reporting on it, kind of like a weatherman for earthquakes and volcanoes.
[01:25:03.741 --> 01:25:07.303]  He has successfully predicted several earthquakes over the years.
[01:25:07.663 --> 01:25:11.188]  Using simple methods, he learned from years of observation.
[01:25:11.188 --> 01:25:16.074]  Janich has come under fire from government officials in the past, but they have now convinced him to stop.
[01:25:17.697 --> 01:25:25.399]  It appears as if the government doesn't want anyone looking into earthquake activity and wants you to think that they are creating them.
[01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:26.640]  And maybe they are.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.620]  But in the late 1940s, the U.S.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.961]  government discovered evidence of a coming magnetic pole flip.
[01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:39.724]  This information was initially classified and was immediately followed by the beginning of the unscientific global warming hoax.
[01:25:39.724 --> 01:25:43.545]  The CIA censored the Adam and Eve story by Chan Thomas.
[01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:51.389]  Which describes cataclysms that cause advanced civilizations to vanish from the earth without a trace.
[01:25:51.389 --> 01:25:58.332]  We've covered this subject before in the report, Imminent Cataclysm and the Plan to Survive the Great Reset.
[01:25:58.332 --> 01:25:59.513]  And suspicious observers
[01:25:59.793 --> 01:26:03.939]  Who have been covering this subject for years is saying that we are in it right now.
[01:26:03.939 --> 01:26:12.450]  It is important we review the two recent studies confirming that we did have a mini geomagnetic excursion in the middle of the Holocene about 6,000 years ago.
[01:26:12.450 --> 01:26:16.316]  First found in China and then confirmed in volcanic flows in Russia.
[01:26:16.756 --> 01:26:21.599]  We have added it to the list of officially confirmed excursions in recent history.
[01:26:21.599 --> 01:26:25.561]  We do appear to have magnetic changes on the planet every 6,000 years.
[01:26:25.561 --> 01:26:35.787]  There are several studies one could look to for the fairly perfect lineup of these geomagnetic changes on Earth, with major environmental disasters, including the peaks of species extinction.
[01:26:36.247 --> 01:26:38.390]  And there's no mystery as to why.
[01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:50.183]  The magnetic field of Earth, which protects our planet from space radiation, weakens tremendously in these excursions and becomes misaligned with the poles, leading to major influx of space energy to Earth.
[01:26:51.084 --> 01:27:05.486]  Scientists and others declared in the year 2000 that we had lost 10% of the magnetic field since the middle of the 1800s, and the ESA Swarm Magnetic Field Mission upgraded that number to 15% in their 2010 mission report and update.
[01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:10.867]  10% lost in 150 years, and then another 5% lost in only a decade.
[01:27:10.867 --> 01:27:11.948]  That's serious.
[01:27:11.948 --> 01:27:20.069]  And several subsequent studies confirmed that the magnetic field has begun changing faster and faster, all pointing to one inevitable conclusion.
[01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:23.550]  The cycle is not only due again, but it's happening.
[01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:29.193]  And it doesn't take thousands of years, and no, it's no small matter for the Earth and the creatures that live here.
[01:27:29.193 --> 01:27:32.174]  Greg Reese, reporting.
[01:27:32.174 --> 01:27:36.116]  Okay, so let's shift gears to London Guardian headline and others I have right here.
[01:27:36.116 --> 01:27:40.898]  Could controlled blackouts save the Earth from climate change?
[01:27:40.898 --> 01:27:41.979]  And here's some of the headlines.
[01:27:41.979 --> 01:27:46.341]  Government tests energy blackout energy plans as supply fears grow.
[01:27:48.277 --> 01:27:53.179]  UK drops plan to prepare for winter blackouts with energy rationing campaign.
[01:27:53.179 --> 01:27:56.761]  National Grid stand down coal plants on standby in icy winter.
[01:27:56.761 --> 01:28:03.685]  They're now announcing, oh, ERCOT in Texas did do the last two blackouts because the feds wouldn't let them turn on coal plants.
[01:28:03.685 --> 01:28:04.965]  I told you that!
[01:28:04.965 --> 01:28:06.326]  It was on record!
[01:28:06.326 --> 01:28:10.668]  The governor asked for them to turn the power up and people say, how is Texas under their control?
[01:28:10.668 --> 01:28:12.689]  That's the EPA.
[01:28:14.258 --> 01:28:17.501]  UK Felony Protect Against Climate Dangers, Advisors Warn.
[01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:19.643]  UK Energy Crisis Responds.
[01:28:19.643 --> 01:28:22.525]  I asked them for The Guardian, they found a bunch of articles on that.
[01:28:22.525 --> 01:28:27.509]  But the point is, is that I showed you the Austin American Statesman two weeks ago.
[01:28:27.509 --> 01:28:34.094]  Texas looking for blackouts to save Austin and to save us from climate change.
[01:28:34.094 --> 01:28:37.197]  Would an occasional blackout help solve climate change?
[01:28:37.197 --> 01:28:39.019]  LA Times, on screen now!
[01:28:40.407 --> 01:28:46.030]  They're the ones cutting the power, folks, and telling you Trump supporters are about to blow everything up.
[01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.030]  Come on, people!
[01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.932]  You're gonna let them plunge us into the dark?

[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:25.927]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:25.927 --> 01:33:39.197]  We have the UN, we have the WEF, we have the corporate media, we have Beto O'Rourke, AOC, William Shatner going up in a spaceship a couple years ago and coming back and saying everybody's about to die, the cataclysm's coming.
[01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:43.400]  We have the FBI saying Trump supporters are going to blow up the power grid imminently.
[01:33:45.222 --> 01:33:54.510]  And then you read NASA, they're like, oh my gosh, there's about to be a new Carrington event, huge solar fairs are going to blow out the satellites and all the internet, it's imminent!
[01:33:54.510 --> 01:34:06.260]  Meanwhile, the real power plants, the real energy, the real systems are all being cut off by our government, and China's only allowed to operate and have all the free energy they want.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.360]  What is about to happen?
[01:34:08.317 --> 01:34:10.018]  What is going down?
[01:34:10.018 --> 01:34:16.420]  An artificial collapse to bring in their new global central bank digital currencies, their ESGs?
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:32.527]  Or do they know there's about to be a major pole shift where Brazil is the North Pole and North America is in the equator where the planet just moves or the pole physically magnetically moves?
[01:34:32.527 --> 01:34:33.247]  Both can happen.
[01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:41.733]  Would an occasional blackout help solve climate change?
[01:34:41.733 --> 01:34:41.993]  L.A.
[01:34:41.993 --> 01:34:44.354]  Times.
[01:34:44.354 --> 01:34:46.015]  That's what they're pushing.
[01:34:46.015 --> 01:34:52.158]  Government tests energy blackout emergency plans as supply fears grow.
[01:34:52.158 --> 01:35:00.022]  They're announcing in Texas they're going to cut the power off because the feds are saying they're not going to give us more power this winter.
[01:35:02.216 --> 01:35:12.060]  They shut down the coal power plants that are charging electric cars, put in electric car chargers that use more than a whole house uses in a week.
[01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:18.443]  Powerful solar storm could knock out the internet for months.
[01:35:18.443 --> 01:35:27.827]  The Houston Chronicle reports there was the Carrington event.
[01:35:32.165 --> 01:35:45.789]  In 1859, 1860, they had other events after it where telegraph wires were turned molten red and melted when a giant solar flare hit the earth.
[01:35:45.789 --> 01:35:48.310]  And now they're telling us it's imminent.
[01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:49.790]  It's imminent.
[01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:51.271]  It's imminent.
[01:35:51.271 --> 01:35:53.771]  The sun is going to shut down the internet.
[01:35:53.771 --> 01:35:59.673]  The sun's going to blow up the power grid.
[01:36:02.193 --> 01:36:06.376]  A powerful solar storm could knock out the internet for months.
[01:36:06.376 --> 01:36:09.839]  A solar storm could cause an internet apocalypse.
[01:36:09.839 --> 01:36:15.823]  A solar super storm could wipe out the internet for weeks or months.
[01:36:15.823 --> 01:36:20.807]  Scientists say Fox News.
[01:36:20.807 --> 01:36:24.150]  Well is it the Trump supporters that are going to blow it up?
[01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:24.990]  With no evidence?
[01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:26.992]  Or is it the sun?
[01:36:26.992 --> 01:36:29.654]  Or is it the globalists are going to hit a few buttons
[01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.650]  Yes.
[01:36:44.241 --> 01:36:46.182]  Central Bank Digital Currency.
[01:36:46.182 --> 01:36:48.503]  Their Ponzi scheme is imploding.
[01:36:48.503 --> 01:37:01.409]  And instead of being Sam Bankman-Fried or Bernie Madoff, who are low-level Ponzi scheme guys, just in the tens of billions, the globalists are dealing in the thousands of billions.
[01:37:01.409 --> 01:37:03.070]  They're dealing in the quadrillions.
[01:37:08.888 --> 01:37:10.630]  You don't need an alien invasion.
[01:37:10.630 --> 01:37:12.472]  Project Blue Beam they've been cooking up.
[01:37:12.472 --> 01:37:14.375]  That's on the books too.
[01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:15.596]  That's in the cards.
[01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:24.367]  No, you just need to say the sun blew it all up or Trump supporters hacked into the internet and shut down the power so now we've got to only direct you to the sites we say.
[01:37:24.367 --> 01:37:26.049]  They say that's what we're going to do.
[01:37:26.989 --> 01:37:28.410]  We'll get your power back on.
[01:37:28.410 --> 01:37:29.951]  We'll get everything working again.
[01:37:29.951 --> 01:37:31.432]  Just do what we say.
[01:37:31.432 --> 01:37:33.873]  They already did lockdowns with viruses.
[01:37:33.873 --> 01:37:35.614]  They already produced in labs.
[01:37:35.614 --> 01:37:44.099]  They already gave us poison shots that have caused 20 million to die and massive heart attacks in children everywhere.
[01:37:44.099 --> 01:37:52.563]  And Canadian TV is running cheesy ads about how it's so normal for little kids to have heart attacks and teenagers and just it's the new normal.
[01:37:52.563 --> 01:37:53.144]  And I remember
[01:37:54.448 --> 01:37:57.649]  They were stealing the election of the American people in 2000.
[01:37:57.649 --> 01:38:03.511]  In November, late November, I was in Phoenix, and I was shooting live reports.
[01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:04.632]  Lockdown was in place.
[01:38:04.632 --> 01:38:05.212]  No one was there.
[01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:07.112]  It was like a ghost town.
[01:38:07.112 --> 01:38:16.316]  And I'm outside the Westin Hotel at a park, shooting videos, shooting reports.
[01:38:16.316 --> 01:38:21.638]  And I watched buses drive by saying, heart attacks are now completely normal.
[01:38:21.638 --> 01:38:22.598]  Another bus drives by.
[01:38:24.741 --> 01:38:27.202]  Nanotech's the answer.
[01:38:27.202 --> 01:38:29.104]  mRNA shots.
[01:38:29.104 --> 01:38:33.926]  They're literally pre-programming it all.
[01:38:33.926 --> 01:38:36.788]  And making it glamorous and cool and fun.
[01:38:36.788 --> 01:38:45.173]  Just like, oh, we have all these runs and marathons and fundraisers to stop autism.
[01:38:45.173 --> 01:38:48.615]  There wasn't one autistic child 50, 60 years ago.
[01:38:48.615 --> 01:38:49.776]  Now they're everywhere!
[01:38:51.863 --> 01:38:57.089]  Don't worry, we've got a 10K that'll pay for the autistic kids.
[01:38:57.089 --> 01:39:06.339]  And then all these scientists and people in an ad, oh my god, my two-year-old is having a heart attack.
[01:39:06.339 --> 01:39:08.682]  The ad's like, it's normal, honey.
[01:39:10.262 --> 01:39:12.243]  It's normal to have heart attacks.
[01:39:12.243 --> 01:39:13.464]  We're here.
[01:39:13.464 --> 01:39:15.825]  Call the National Health Service.
[01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:16.946]  It always happens.
[01:39:16.946 --> 01:39:19.307]  Children always have heart attacks.
[01:39:19.307 --> 01:39:21.568]  People always live to 30.
[01:39:21.568 --> 01:39:23.069]  People are always sterile.
[01:39:23.069 --> 01:39:23.950]  It's normal.
[01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:25.650]  Fentanyl's normal.
[01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:28.692]  Drag queen pedophile time's normal.
[01:39:28.692 --> 01:39:31.474]  It's all normal.
[01:39:31.474 --> 01:39:35.476]  Here's the ad airing on national Canadian television.
[01:39:36.786 --> 01:39:48.832]  That it's just so normal to have heart attacks, but don't worry, the government and the media is going to come to you and give your child medical treatment for that new heart problem they've got.
[01:39:48.832 --> 01:39:50.814]  You didn't do anything wrong, give them that shot.
[01:39:50.814 --> 01:39:53.055]  It wasn't the shot.
[01:39:53.055 --> 01:39:53.415]  Here it is.
[01:39:56.213 --> 01:40:03.496]  Totally normal.
[01:40:03.496 --> 01:40:06.016]  You're 15.
[01:40:06.016 --> 01:40:07.217]  You're having a heart attack?
[01:40:07.217 --> 01:40:09.297]  That happens to everybody.
[01:40:09.297 --> 01:40:14.359]  You're not 80 years old.
[01:40:14.359 --> 01:40:18.800]  Oh, but look, the medical system's saving you.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.021]  Oh, your mommy's upset.
[01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:27.614]  So they show you all the drama.
[01:40:27.614 --> 01:40:28.975]  Oh, look, he had that heart attack.
[01:40:28.975 --> 01:40:30.597]  It's okay.
[01:40:30.597 --> 01:40:38.364]  Tim Cook's gay.
[01:40:38.364 --> 01:40:39.565]  He's having a lot of fear.
[01:40:39.565 --> 01:40:41.907]  It's okay.
[01:40:41.907 --> 01:40:43.469]  Yeah, he's a little boy.
[01:40:43.469 --> 01:40:45.971]  It's like those drug ads that make any sense.
[01:40:45.971 --> 01:40:49.174]  Like, you're hiking up a mountain, you take the drug, you're fine now.
[01:40:52.332 --> 01:40:54.073]  It's like, anxiety.
[01:40:54.073 --> 01:40:55.713]  You're all going to have heart attacks now.
[01:40:55.713 --> 01:40:59.294]  It's okay.
[01:40:59.294 --> 01:41:01.215]  Oh, he always had anxiety.
[01:41:01.215 --> 01:41:05.256]  He always had heart problems since he was little.
[01:41:05.256 --> 01:41:08.317]  It didn't just happen.
[01:41:08.317 --> 01:41:10.098]  They didn't diagnose it.
[01:41:10.098 --> 01:41:13.079]  Everyone had heart problems.
[01:41:13.079 --> 01:41:15.299]  It was genetic.
[01:41:15.299 --> 01:41:18.320]  You had heart problems when you were little.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.661]  You just had a heart attack when you were 15.
[01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:23.311]  But she's gonna save you.
[01:41:23.311 --> 01:41:25.232]  She's got a white lab coat.
[01:41:25.232 --> 01:41:26.713]  She just saw your genetics.
[01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:33.197]  That's why you just had a heart attack.
[01:41:33.197 --> 01:41:33.997]  Oh, thank God.
[01:41:33.997 --> 01:41:35.298]  Oh, they're gonna mRNA him.
[01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:37.900]  They're gonna give him a CAT scan.
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:42.262]  We're so sorry your 14-year-old, 15-year-old said a heart attack.
[01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:45.064]  He had problems when he rode a bike when he was little.
[01:41:45.064 --> 01:41:46.064]  That's why.
[01:41:46.064 --> 01:41:48.286]  The heart attacks were always there.
[01:41:48.286 --> 01:41:49.967]  We just didn't know.
[01:41:53.837 --> 01:41:57.538]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[01:41:57.538 --> 01:41:58.478]  He's like so cool now.
[01:41:58.478 --> 01:42:00.099]  He's had a heart attack.
[01:42:00.099 --> 01:42:03.680]  And now he's gonna have heart medication if he survives.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:04.620]  But it's okay.
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.060]  It's okay.
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.261]  It was always there.
[01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:10.382]  Wasn't the shot.
[01:42:10.382 --> 01:42:13.723]  Now you've got a pacemaker.
[01:42:13.723 --> 01:42:14.503]  Oh!
[01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:16.744]  They fixed you!
[01:42:16.744 --> 01:42:16.864]  Oh!
[01:42:19.096 --> 01:42:21.036]  Oh my god, it's so normal now.
[01:42:21.036 --> 01:42:23.737]  It's so... Heal the future.
[01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:26.598]  All your children are having heart attacks now.
[01:42:26.598 --> 01:42:28.378]  SickKidsVS.
[01:42:28.378 --> 01:42:29.418]  Oh.
[01:42:29.418 --> 01:42:31.199]  That's so loving.
[01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:32.399]  Oh.
[01:42:32.399 --> 01:42:39.540]  And soon they'll say, they already are actually, it's a conspiracy theory to say children didn't used to have heart attacks.
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:41.381]  They're like, how dare you attack them?
[01:42:41.381 --> 01:42:42.681]  We're saving them.
[01:42:42.681 --> 01:42:45.602]  No, they always had heart attacks.
[01:42:45.602 --> 01:42:46.302]  Come on.
[01:42:47.302 --> 01:42:50.283]  Are you starting to figure out how liberal this is?
[01:42:50.283 --> 01:42:53.144]  How loving?
[01:42:53.144 --> 01:42:54.725]  Don't read the studies.
[01:42:54.725 --> 01:42:59.627]  Just take the shots.
[01:42:59.627 --> 01:43:05.829]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:43:05.829 --> 01:43:10.511]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:43:10.511 --> 01:43:14.873]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:16.313 --> 01:43:19.357]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:43:19.357 --> 01:43:20.938]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:43:20.938 --> 01:43:26.885]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine on their bodies.
[01:43:26.885 --> 01:43:32.911]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:43:32.911 --> 01:43:35.674]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:43:37.569 --> 01:43:38.890]  I don't know.
[01:43:59.119 --> 01:44:05.424]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4Ware's store and M4Ware's life not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:44:05.424 --> 01:44:06.645]  The answer is simple.

[01:44:13.711 --> 01:44:19.116]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[01:44:19.876 --> 01:44:25.380]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:02.762]  Last year we put this book out.
[01:46:03.618 --> 01:46:04.418]  We're good to go.
[01:46:20.828 --> 01:46:21.268]  We're good to go.
[01:46:39.986 --> 01:46:47.733]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[01:46:47.733 --> 01:46:54.318]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to Infowarstore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[01:46:54.318 --> 01:46:55.539]  This is going to go to number one.
[01:46:55.539 --> 01:46:57.021]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:46:57.021 --> 01:46:58.082]  It's a powerful book.
[01:46:58.082 --> 01:47:00.464]  Get yours now.
[01:47:00.464 --> 01:47:06.389]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.529 --> 01:47:30.553]  During that little short break, I was sitting here thinking, why are the globalists trying to depopulate us?
[01:47:30.553 --> 01:47:33.675]  Why is there, like, a gun metaphysically in their head to do it?
[01:47:33.675 --> 01:47:40.840]  It's because they know there's a Great Awakening happening, and they're going to lose control if they don't wipe out the majority of the population.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.023]  And then, literally, the crew walks in and hands me this stack of news.
[01:47:45.023 --> 01:47:54.570]  Javier Millet, the anti-globalist, anti-communist, anti-New World Order, pro-Alex Jones, pro-Donald Trump, pro-Tucker Carlson candidate,
[01:47:55.814 --> 01:48:00.758]  We're winning from Sweden to Argentina.
[01:48:00.758 --> 01:48:01.859]  From New Zealand to Italy.
[01:48:20.885 --> 01:48:32.650]  We're winning everywhere and that's why the globalists are scared and want to create a devastating collapse of civilization, a major control power outage, you name it.
[01:48:32.650 --> 01:48:45.616]  So as positive as the Great Awakening is, we've got to understand the enemy is planning to strike back.
[01:48:45.616 --> 01:48:47.837]  Victory for TV celebrity turned political
[01:48:49.904 --> 01:48:50.645]  We're good to go.
[01:49:19.028 --> 01:49:32.017]  The Mick Jagger impersonating TV celebrity turned politician who is often compared to Donald Trump has secured nearly 56% of the vote compared to his rival's 44.1.
[01:49:32.017 --> 01:49:38.221]  Freedom is popular and the system is in full panic.
[01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:39.582]  And the globalists aren't God.
[01:49:39.582 --> 01:49:46.867]  We're a planet two thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy hurtling through time and space.
[01:49:46.867 --> 01:49:48.628]  They're not God, but neither are we.
[01:49:50.001 --> 01:49:58.108]  What are they going to pull when everything's turning against them and everything is blowing up in their face?
[01:49:58.108 --> 01:50:02.091]  That's the big question you've got to be asking tonight.
[01:50:02.091 --> 01:50:14.802]  And when the FBI, we pull the headlines up, tells you Trump supporters are going to hack the power grid imminently with no proof, who does it aid to collapse civilization?
[01:50:14.802 --> 01:50:16.704]  What they try with COVID, the lockdowns.
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:22.503]  To shut down all the small businesses and double their profits, which they did.
[01:50:22.503 --> 01:50:23.603]  They have the motive.
[01:50:23.603 --> 01:50:24.704]  They have the history.
[01:50:24.704 --> 01:50:26.785]  They've done it before.
[01:50:26.785 --> 01:50:29.386]  They're not just the prime suspects.
[01:50:29.386 --> 01:50:35.550]  They're the ones behind it.
[01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:36.751]  What a time to be alive.
[01:50:36.751 --> 01:50:39.252]  Argentina's new president is radical libertarian.
[01:50:39.252 --> 01:50:41.553]  Javier Mele.
[01:50:41.553 --> 01:50:42.914]  Mele wins presidential vote.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:48.481]  His opponent admits defeat.
[01:50:48.481 --> 01:50:50.841]  What a time to be alive.
[01:50:50.841 --> 01:50:54.062]  But we're told by NASA, imminent solar flares.
[01:50:54.062 --> 01:50:59.583]  Yeah, there he is with the don't tread on me flag, the Marine Corps, the Navy flag.
[01:50:59.583 --> 01:51:09.245]  They're telling you there's an imminent attack or an imminent solar flare about to knock the power out ahead of the election.
[01:51:10.737 --> 01:51:12.538]  It's on the table for them to kill Biden.
[01:51:12.538 --> 01:51:13.838]  Blame it on a right-winger.
[01:51:13.838 --> 01:51:16.319]  It's on the table for them to kill Trump.
[01:51:16.319 --> 01:51:17.799]  Blame it on a left-winger.
[01:51:17.799 --> 01:51:18.899]  Don't riot in the streets.
[01:51:18.899 --> 01:51:20.160]  Don't kill cops.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.360]  Don't randomly run around like an idiot.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.521]  It's intellectual, spiritual battle.
[01:51:24.521 --> 01:51:26.602]  Defend your family, though.
[01:51:26.602 --> 01:51:28.062]  And be ready.
[01:51:28.062 --> 01:51:34.524]  Because make no mistake, we're living in the most historic time in human history right now.
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:40.201]  Chase Geyser, really smart guy, great talk show host, is going to take over Sunday Night Live.
[01:51:40.201 --> 01:51:45.963]  There's only six minutes of ads an hour during Sunday Night Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:51:45.963 --> 01:51:48.104]  He's loaded for bear to cover all this.
[01:51:48.104 --> 01:51:50.364]  Take your calls, special guests and more.
[01:51:50.364 --> 01:51:53.125]  Chase Geyser, coming up.
[01:51:53.125 --> 01:51:59.567]  But before I end this hour, I just want to say something here because every show could be my last.
[01:51:59.567 --> 01:52:01.108]  And we're all on borrowed time here.
[01:52:01.108 --> 01:52:02.448]  It's all up to God how long we're here.
[01:52:03.621 --> 01:52:05.682]  I'm very thankful to the crew.
[01:52:05.682 --> 01:52:08.863]  Very thankful for our listeners and supporters.
[01:52:08.863 --> 01:52:13.846]  I'm very thankful to God, obviously, and my family, who's been put through a lot of hell for this fight.
[01:52:13.846 --> 01:52:19.788]  And I got to tell you that we've reached the real quickening point here.
[01:52:19.788 --> 01:52:25.991]  Everything I've done in 29 years on air, in April it'll be 30.
[01:52:25.991 --> 01:52:31.554]  April 1994, I first began to host my own shows.
[01:52:33.585 --> 01:52:35.046]  30 years in the fight.
[01:52:35.046 --> 01:52:37.568]  Seems like 10 seconds.
[01:52:37.568 --> 01:52:41.651]  And I know I'll go, and I'll die, and I'm going to meet the Lord, but there'll be people that won't come after me.
[01:52:41.651 --> 01:52:43.112]  But I want you to know this.
[01:52:43.112 --> 01:52:55.462]  We're living in epic times right now, and don't make any mistake about that.
[01:52:55.462 --> 01:52:56.703]  The globalists have been defeated.
[01:52:59.059 --> 01:53:02.462]  The problem is they're like sharks, they got multiple rows of teeth.
[01:53:02.462 --> 01:53:04.764]  This group we defeat, there's another group behind them.
[01:53:04.764 --> 01:53:12.871]  It's an inside job to change our soul, to seek God's face and repent, and to ask God to heal our land.
[01:53:12.871 --> 01:53:15.153]  That's really where we are right now.
[01:53:15.153 --> 01:53:22.079]  Yeah, we're going to win politically everywhere, despite the indictments, despite the censorship, despite the attacks.
[01:53:22.079 --> 01:53:23.640]  Humanity's will is strong.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.082]  I bet on the right horse.
[01:53:25.082 --> 01:53:26.583]  I believe in you because I believe in me.
[01:53:29.738 --> 01:53:32.840]  But the globalists are willing to start nuclear war.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:36.984]  The globalists are willing to cut off the energy, which they've already done.
[01:53:36.984 --> 01:53:40.006]  You understand they've already cut off 30% of the fertilizer in the last two years.
[01:53:40.006 --> 01:53:43.088]  That's going to kill 100 million people, they admit.
[01:53:43.088 --> 01:53:52.335]  I mean, we are in a very... And so I feel sorry for the third world populations, not allowed to have jobs, not allowed to work, starving, flooding us, who are then organized against us.
[01:53:52.335 --> 01:53:53.036]  I care about them.
[01:53:53.036 --> 01:53:54.197]  They're victims.
[01:53:54.197 --> 01:53:57.159]  But they're a weapon now turned against us.
[01:53:57.159 --> 01:53:57.720]  I love water.
[01:53:58.615 --> 01:54:00.596]  Take a bath in it, drink it, it's great.
[01:54:00.596 --> 01:54:02.557]  Gotta have it.
[01:54:02.557 --> 01:54:06.439]  But if somebody blows up a dam above your town, it floods you.
[01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:08.560]  It kills you.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:25.769]  So how do you thread the needle of not hating the migrants who've had their economy shut down, and are totally enslaved, and are desperately trying to get food for their families, and then they show up here and are brainwashed by BlackRock and the UN to hate America and hate white people?
[01:54:25.769 --> 01:54:27.530]  We gotta figure out how we're gonna deal with this.
[01:54:29.932 --> 01:54:39.335]  And reach out to these people, but also try to end the lockdowns of their countries so they don't have to come here, but the ones that get here, we got to reach out to them.
[01:54:39.335 --> 01:54:47.698]  It's a big problem, but God's given us the tools to fix it and we can do it together and we've got to do it together.
[01:54:47.698 --> 01:54:48.858]  That is the Great Commission.
[01:54:50.424 --> 01:54:53.386]  And in closing, I'll just say this before Chase Geiser takes over.

[01:56:02.792 --> 01:56:06.193]  But I hate something way worse, and that's giving up and failing.
[01:56:06.193 --> 01:56:09.314]  We've delivered via the grace of God.
[01:56:09.314 --> 01:56:12.195]  We've followed the course.

[01:59:03.445 --> 01:59:04.186]  Down-and-out?
[01:59:04.186 --> 01:59:04.706]  What's better?
[01:59:04.706 --> 01:59:06.967]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:59:06.967 --> 01:59:11.910]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:59:12.603 --> 01:59:16.568]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:59:16.568 --> 01:59:17.909]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:59:17.909 --> 01:59:19.211]  They're all very diverse.
[01:59:19.211 --> 01:59:29.402]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.
