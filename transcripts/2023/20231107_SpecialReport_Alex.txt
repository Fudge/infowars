[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]  Have you heard of the matter of Owen Schreyer?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  [Music]
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.419]   I come to you with grave information for the future of our country, our republic, for the First Amendment and for
[00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.000]  journalism in this nation.
[00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:30.368]   Now what I'm about to break here was the subject of a congressional hearing today where the head of the Federal Bureau of Prisons was asked by Congressman Matt Gaetz and others about Owen Schroer.
[00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:41.956]  Now when Owen was sentenced to two months in federal prison for being outside the Capitol on January 6, peacefully trying to stop people going in, a lot of people said, hey, get over it.
[00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:42.717]  It's 60 days.
[00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:45.299]  It's not 22 years like other innocent people.
[00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:46.320]  And we get that.
[00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:58.045]  My concern was that once they got him in their clutches, in their federal prison, no matter how good a quote, inmate he was, they would really try to pull some serious shenanigans.
[00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:03.449]  And if he quote, has infractions, they could try to extend his time in prison.
[00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.731]  That's been my main concern.
[00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:08.593]  So Owen went in a little over two and a half weeks ago.
[00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:14.298]  They put him in solitary confinement for the first week, locked inside a jail cell all day and all night.
[00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:19.485]  As a COVID protocol and I said clearly this is political retribution.
[00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:24.427]  But then he got out for one day in general population.
[00:01:25.447 --> 00:01:26.908]  We have this from inside sources.
[00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:31.130]  And he was put back in solitary this time for 30 days.
[00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:38.215]  At least for calling out from the prison, which is his first from the right.
[00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.257]  We've had countless prisoners over the years call in from federal prison.
[00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:43.559]  I even had people call in from death row before.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.145]  We just saw, obviously, Tucker Carlson travel to London, England to talk to Julian Assange in prison.
[00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:53.627]  So even Julian Assange is allowed to talk to reporters.
[00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:55.788]  Now, here's the new development.
[00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.172]  We have our sources, and I have to leave it at that, and I got this information.
[00:02:00.994 --> 00:02:05.394]   last week, but we've only now confirmed it, from inside the prison that he's been sent
[00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:12.034]   to a special area of the sprawling federal prison in solitary confinement 24 hours a
[00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:17.794]   day because he called out of the prison and the folks he talked to recorded it and then
[00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:18.794]  put it on Twitter.
[00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:23.995]   And he said nothing against the prison, nothing against Obama, who's the real president right
[00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:27.513]   now, just came out in NBC News that he is running the White House, as we said two and
[00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:28.033]  a half years ago.
[00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:30.545]  So, this is crazy.
[00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:50.180]   So, my lawyer, it's also Owen's lawyer, Norm Pattis went to Congress yesterday and today, talked to Congresswoman Matt Gaetz, talked to others, and they're very concerned as well because the Bureau of Prisons, under the direction of the federal prosecutors out of D.C., is persecuting anybody related to January 6th.
[00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:56.525]  Women that walked between the velvet ropes and didn't attack anybody, didn't touch anybody, are getting six months in jail.
[00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.847]  And they're locking them up in solitary confinement as well.
[00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:02.770]  They've beaten people, put their eyes out, blinded people.
[00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:06.133]  This is true torture, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:10.496]  So people that burned down buildings and shot people, they got bailed out by Kamala Harris.
[00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:10.917]  Remember that?
[00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:19.927]  But now, Owen Schroer is spending a month in solitary confinement, and then when he gets out, he'll have weeks and weeks and weeks left.
[00:03:20.787 --> 00:03:22.188]  God knows what they're going to do.
[00:03:22.488 --> 00:03:29.970]  In fact, it might be better after this, they just keep him there, because they're going to have an inmate attacking, if he fights back, they'll charge him, and he's gone, folks.
[00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.890]  He's gone.
[00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.430]  This is a message to me.
[00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.232]  They're saying, we'll get your co-hosts, we'll get your talk show hosts, we'll get your crew, and it's meant to scare the rest of the crew here.
[00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:43.641]   Just like they're trying to put Trump in prison, they try to put me in prison
[00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:47.902]   and countless others, it's a message to you that you should cower and be afraid.
[00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:51.542]   That's why libertarians, conservatives, populists won't even protest anymore
[00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:53.662]  because they saw what happened to January 6th.
[00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:57.162]   Meanwhile, Muslims are taking over military bases and airports and,
[00:03:57.162 --> 00:04:00.182]  well, you know, I mean, I mean, it's happening everywhere.
[00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:01.334]  Attacking the White House?
[00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:02.955]  I don't endorse that.
[00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:03.835]  We're not doing that.
[00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:06.375]  Imagine if we behaved like that.
[00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:12.776]  So a totally peaceful individual, Owen Schroyer, is now in solitary confinement.
[00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:21.798]  We're going to play the clip, show the tweet by Don Jr., Jack Posobiec, and others, where they talk about this, but this is a big deal.
[00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:27.259]  So my gut instinct was they were going to pull something big once Owen got in, and they've done it.
[00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:30.525]  We've had the lawyers check the law, everything else.
[00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:32.105]  You're allowed to call out.
[00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:37.506]  You're allowed in your little time, 15 minutes, to be on a radio show or talk to your grandma or whoever you want.
[00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:40.607]  But they're saying that's not the case.
[00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:41.967]  And here's what's even crazier.
[00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:43.628]  They won't talk to his lawyer.
[00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:45.648]  They won't talk to his family.
[00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.509]  He's unable to call anybody.
[00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.083]  And so Norm Pattis has already been to D.C.
[00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:51.684]  for three days.
[00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:54.846]  Next he's going down to Louisiana to try to get in.
[00:04:55.547 --> 00:04:57.589]  And it's the same district of the new Speaker of the House.
[00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.270]  He's now informed.
[00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.053]  It looks like he may, or one of his representatives, go to the prison.
[00:05:03.714 --> 00:05:05.836]  And they're so arrogant, they don't care.
[00:05:07.037 --> 00:05:08.978]  So, members of Congress have tried to call.
[00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:11.461]  Lawyers have tried to get involved.
[00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:12.882]  They've tried to find out where Owen is.
[00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:14.183]  We're told nothing.
[00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:23.808]  Except for our sources, and I'm going to leave it at that because obviously there's a lot of people that work for the president and others that are really upset by this.
[00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:26.092]  Owen is a Boy Scout and a great guy.
[00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:27.674]  And again, it's bigger than Owen.
[00:05:28.868 --> 00:05:31.671]  This is an attack on everybody's free speech, everybody's freedom.
[00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:35.494]  This is outlawing political dissent and outlawing question elections.
[00:05:35.974 --> 00:05:37.736]  And they're getting ready to steal the next election.
[00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:49.627]  It's just come out in Congress, big reports, how they manipulated the last election, the election before that, how they blocked all this important news and information, how they buried, obviously, the Hunter Biden laptop, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:54.171]   So this is a Very, very serious situation.
[00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:58.215]  And I think we should pray for Owen, and I hope they don't have steaming.
[00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:01.398]  They may, as a message to everybody out there, kill him.
[00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:03.019]  Now, I'm not trying to be dramatic here.
[00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.581]  I'm not trying to scare people.
[00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:06.963]  They want to intimidate us.
[00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:08.624]  They want to scare you.
[00:06:09.305 --> 00:06:13.252]   Owen is not suicidal, and if they do, Kill him.
[00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.673]  They're going to be held responsible for what they've done.
[00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.393]  But that's how serious things have gotten in this country.
[00:06:18.913 --> 00:06:21.374]  I think there's a chance they might kill him in the prison.
[00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:25.135]  And it's disgusting.
[00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:28.095]  But they know they're being watched, so they may not do it.
[00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:30.936]  But they already turned the cameras off with Epstein and broke his neck in three places.
[00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:34.997]  So I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I had a bad feeling about this the whole time.
[00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:38.883]  That's just where we are.
[00:06:38.963 --> 00:06:40.724]  So we need a congressional investigation.
[00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:45.786]  We saw the weaponization of the IRS against conservatives under Obama.
[00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:49.347]  This is the third unelected administration of Obama.
[00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:51.748]  And it's disgusting what our country puts up with.
[00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:57.310]  Child traffickers who've been arrested multiple times, smuggling children and selling them in sex trafficking.
[00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.690]  In one case, five times.
[00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.991]  Don't even get jail time.
[00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.592]  But Owen Schroer is now in their clutches.
[00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:06.293]  And do you think once they get somebody in their clutches, they're going to turn loose?
[00:07:07.717 --> 00:07:09.618]  Not unless they know there's a major spotlight.
[00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:13.401]  And I'm not saying all the people in the jail are bad, or the president.
[00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:15.103]  I'm not saying all the federal guards are bad.
[00:07:16.564 --> 00:07:17.725]  And people are watching in the prison.
[00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:26.536]   But I'm saying, from DC, from Obama's White House, he's got a literal The building complex is a few miles from the White House.
[00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:27.657]  The real White House.
[00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:30.460]  This is being directed as a message to us all.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.922]  So please, pray for Owen.
[00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:33.523]  He's not suicidal.
[00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:38.128]  And let the system know, if you try to Arkansas him, you're not going to get away with it.
[00:07:38.148 --> 00:07:38.849]  It's going to be too far.
[00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.290]  God bless you all.
[00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:41.532]  You can tune into a show every day.
[00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:43.093]  Harrison Smith's hosting it.
[00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:43.894]  3 to 6 PM.
[00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:47.236]  And we just are praying for Owen.
[00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:48.357]  He should be out of solitary.
[00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:52.199]  He should be able to call his family, his lawyer, but he's unable to.
[00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.241]  His lawyer, again, was putting in calls the first time he was in solitary.
[00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:56.762]  No call back.
[00:07:57.222 --> 00:07:58.523]  So he's back in solitary.
[00:07:58.983 --> 00:07:59.924]  We're not being dramatic.
[00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:02.525]  These are dramatic, dangerous times we live in.
[00:08:03.186 --> 00:08:04.446]  We're not the ones being dramatic.
[00:08:04.927 --> 00:08:13.712]  The system is being completely out of control and is doing things that are just literally the very essence of tyranny.
[00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:18.564]  I was very heartened by your discussion of site visits to our prisons to get a first-hand understanding of what's going on there.
[00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:20.605]  Sometimes members of Congress have had challenges doing that.
[00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:24.145]   because if they get through Ellen Schroer, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump, they're going
[00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:25.545]  to get everybody else.
[00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:26.745]  God bless and good luck.
[00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:32.604]   I was very heartened by your discussion of site visits to our prisons to get a first-hand
[00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:35.183]  understanding of what's going on there.
[00:08:35.183 --> 00:08:37.865]   Sometimes members of Congress have had challenges doing that.
[00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:43.264]   Could you give us some advice if we wanted to glean those benefits and get that first-hand
[00:08:43.264 --> 00:08:44.264]  experience?
[00:08:44.264 --> 00:08:46.825]  What's the best way for us to go about that with your team?
[00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.970]  Thank you, Congressman.
[00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.952]  So if you have your team reach out to our Office of Legislative Affairs, we will be happy to make that arrangement.
[00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:55.832]  Thank you so much.
[00:08:57.032 --> 00:09:02.954]  Does the Bureau of Prisons retaliate against people based on constitutionally protected speech?
[00:09:03.694 --> 00:09:07.575]  I have been very clear that retaliation will not be stood for on my watch.
[00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:18.010]   And you're confident that that's being I'm confident that message has been delivered, and if anyone engages in retaliation, we will hold them accountable.
[00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.591]  Are you familiar with the matter of John Strand?
[00:09:21.292 --> 00:09:22.713]  That name is not familiar to me.
[00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:33.579]  So Mr. Strand was a witness at a hearing that we had regarding some of the civil rights concerns of people who had interacted with the Department of Justice in January 6th matters.
[00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:51.206]   He was convicted, sentenced, and is at FCI Miami, and I'd received word that he had been Congressman, I wouldn't be able to speak to an individual's circumstances regarding their behavior inside our institutions.
[00:09:51.046 --> 00:09:53.606]  that others had put out on his Twitter feed.
[00:09:53.606 --> 00:09:56.646]  So is that something you, does that ring a bell to you?
[00:09:56.646 --> 00:10:01.446]   Congressman, I wouldn't be able to speak to an individual's circumstances
[00:10:01.446 --> 00:10:03.326]  regarding their behavior inside our institutions.
[00:10:03.326 --> 00:10:09.806]   What I can assure you is that if an individual is placed in our special housing unit,
[00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:14.046]   it would be for conduct that happened inside the institution.
[00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:15.910]  So what's a special housing unit?
[00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:33.685]   A special housing unit is one of our restrictive housing placements that could include disciplinary segregation, protective custody, and would house individuals that either were at harm to harm themselves or others, or had actually engaged in
[00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:35.904]  misbehavior inside our institutions.
[00:10:35.904 --> 00:10:40.065]   What I'm worried about is that Mr. Strand gave us testimony about some of his concerns,
[00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:43.745]   and as you know, people give us testimony, sort through what's right and wrong,
[00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:48.145]   and should be acted on and shouldn't be acted on. It's not gospel, it's just testimony.
[00:10:48.145 --> 00:10:52.945]   But then thereafter, people were posting on some of his social media platforms his
[00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:55.585]  concerns about the treatment he'd received at the Bureau.
[00:10:55.806 --> 00:11:02.548]  And then I sent a letter to you concerned about that, because like you, I don't want anyone retaliated against for a constitutionally protected speech.
[00:11:03.088 --> 00:11:19.491]  And thereafter, I got a letter back from the aforementioned Office of Legislative Affairs in your office, and they say, in part, Mr. Strand was moved to a secure housing unit with increased supervision and frequent employee contact on September 26, 2023, pending completion of an investigation.
[00:11:20.003 --> 00:11:28.368]  So, I guess my question is, is that akin to what we would normally think about as solitary confinement?
[00:11:28.728 --> 00:11:29.269]  Those words?
[00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:32.431]  Secure housing unit with increased supervision and frequent employee contact?
[00:11:32.511 --> 00:11:34.031]  We would use the word restrictive housing.
[00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:34.932]  Okay.
[00:11:35.452 --> 00:11:36.173]  So what's this then?
[00:11:36.193 --> 00:11:48.000]  Because this guy was never violent toward anyone, so I'm just wondering why the assets that we fund for the highest acuity violent people would be used for this purpose.
[00:11:48.647 --> 00:11:56.873]  Congressman, we use that special housing unit for individuals that engage in any sort of misconduct inside our institutions.
[00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:15.566]  I don't know what he was found to be guilty of by our hearings administrative process that would warrant his need to go into restrictive housing, but I assure you we have administrative processes that people have to go through before those placements actually occur.
[00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:16.447]  Yeah, I get that.
[00:12:17.192 --> 00:12:20.154]  You can't know the conditions of every single prisoner throughout the Bureau.
[00:12:20.214 --> 00:12:36.125]  This is one I've ripened and sent to you because I am worried that throughout our Department of Justice and what we've endured, that there are some people who are sort of being used as pawns and they're being mistreated in order to send a message to other people.
[00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.187]  And I'm grateful that you've said here that is not your doctrine.
[00:12:39.207 --> 00:12:47.455]   You don't want to see that happen, but you also haven't been able to share with us an entire confidence That isn't happening in some cases, and I'm worried that it's happening here.
[00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.175]  Have you heard of the matter of Owen Schreyer?
[00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.256]  No, that name is not familiar to me.
[00:12:51.296 --> 00:12:52.456]  Very similar fact pattern.
[00:12:52.476 --> 00:13:04.679]  You know, somebody who had sort of spoken out, was prominent in the public, was convicted as a consequence of activities on January 6th, and now feels as though there's specific Bureau of Prison retaliation.
[00:13:05.492 --> 00:13:07.534]  I don't think any group of people should be retaliated against.
[00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:15.039]  So I look forward to taking you up on the offer to perhaps go in and do some site visits and see how people are being treated and get that information directly.
[00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:30.379]   So I hope I get prompt cooperation from OLA It's hard to believe that we're already in November 2023
[00:13:31.263 --> 00:13:35.144]  That means in one year is the big election of all elections.
[00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:39.985]  There are attempts to put President Trump in prison and to steal another election.
[00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:43.626]  Now, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:49.448]  If I don't tell you that without your support, InfoWars is going to shut down, it will shut down.
[00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:53.649]  And we have had the enemies of freedom trying to shut us down for years.
[00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:54.849]  We've been very close before.
[00:13:55.708 --> 00:14:07.015]  But right now, we're the closest we've ever been to not having funding to operate during this critical time in the battle, not just for our country, but the whole world and our attempts here to stop World War III.
[00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:15.001]  And so many big stories we break, like their attempts at new lockdowns, which they did try but failed, have changed the world.
[00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:15.901]  You've changed the world.
[00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:17.582]  So you don't just listen and watch.
[00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:18.963]  You don't just share the articles and videos.

[00:14:28.925 --> 00:14:30.827]  We barely have the funds to continue operating.
[00:14:31.148 --> 00:14:32.509]  I want to thank you for your past support.

[00:15:09.803 --> 00:15:14.004]  That means an injection that the doctor gives you, or under the tongue, where there's the blood vessels.
