[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:22.715]  I just want to pause here for all the dead from the poison shots and all the dead from the evil wars and all the dead from the fentanyl and the human trafficking and just everything and just pause because it almost kind of feels weird to just be a commentator here on air like giving analysis instead of a boxing match the potential end of the world.
[00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.394]  But it's a big, complex world, and there was some heroic action I could take to stop this.
[00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:31.395]  I would do it, but there's not.
[00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:35.038]  Because it's a fight between good versus evil.
[00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:38.201]  And the fight goes on in all our hearts and all our minds.
[00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:45.466]  And good has finally woken up and is rising, as Newtonian physics shows, for every action there's an opposite-equal reaction.
[00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:50.030]  And evil is not being driven off its quarry very easily.
[00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:53.493]  And it's pulling out all the stops right now.
[00:00:58.098 --> 00:01:03.020]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.879]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:24.879]  [Music]
[00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:26.050]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.630]  Today.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.401]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.622]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:42.082]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.843]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:45.863]  What a beautiful setup.
[00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:52.344]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:01:52.664 --> 00:01:57.664]  Visit Infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:01:57.664 --> 00:02:07.664]  [Music]
[00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:16.334]   Recently, the O'Keefe Media Group leaked a video showing our CEO at IBM engaging in hiring discrimination against
[00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.663]  white and Asian individuals.
[00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.231]  That's nothing but a lie, is it though?
[00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:29.058]  He's literally on tape forcing us to discriminate against white and Asian people in our hiring practices.
[00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:31.620]  Was that the best opening you could come up with?
[00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:39.900]  In our hiring practices at IBM, we do not discriminate against white and Asian people.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.942]  We just prefer black people.
[00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:43.263]  Now you just made it worse.
[00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:44.564]  That's worse.
[00:02:44.944 --> 00:02:47.366]  I mean, this whole statement is just worthless.
[00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:51.309]  The boss is literally on tape doing the discrimination.
[00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.230]  How can we reverse that?
[00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:59.335]  By the way, didn't we pull our advertising from X because we have zero tolerance for discrimination?
[00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:01.217]  We are doing the same thing.
[00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:02.922]  I don't get it.
[00:03:03.323 --> 00:03:04.525]  Come up with something better.
[00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:11.358]  The O'Keefe Media Group is owned by James O'Keefe, a white man, and should not be trusted.
[00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.162]  That's it, you people are fucking idiots.
[00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:20.591]  Does Elon Musk know what the word blackmail means?
[00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:26.376]  He's now saying he's not going to be blackmailed by these advertisers, okay?
[00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:31.820]  He's also been boosting the old Pizzagate conspiracy theory lately.
[00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:44.731]  At some point, our governments, our other businesses, our counterparts are starting to look at Elon Musk and saying, this person shouldn't have... I mean, think about all the government contracts he has, right?
[00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:51.115]  If any other Fortune 500 CEO did a fraction of what he does, they'd be out on their ear.
[00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:56.258]  Stephanie, you just started by implying that he doesn't know what blackmailing is.
[00:03:56.738 --> 00:04:04.022]  Then you implied that because he interacted with content like Pizzagate, it's the right thing for the government and businesses to cut ties with him.
[00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:08.565]  So basically you proved his point that he is in fact being blackmailed.
[00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:17.652]  Because at a deeper level, something like Pizzagate merely scratches the surface of the reality of powerful people engaging in child trafficking.
[00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:24.157]  So it's very interesting that mainstream media and people like you have a problem with people talking about it.
[00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:25.298]  Why is that?
[00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:30.662]  Why is it that your network never talked about Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton's connections?
[00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:35.474]  Nobody was in charge, and that's a really distressing thing to think about.
[00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:42.541]  At a television network, you want to have stars on screen, you want to have people behind the scenes producing, and executives who are holding everybody responsible.
[00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.423]  That just isn't how it works at Fox.
[00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:48.447]  I know at CNN, if I went on the air and I started lying about something, I'd be held accountable.
[00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:55.414]  Brian, at CNN you lied about many things, and I'm amazed that you can sit here with a straight face and say what you just said.
[00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:58.975]  I mean, on your failure of a show you called Reliable Sources.
[00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:02.397]  You constantly called Trump supporters the cult of Trump.
[00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.598]  You spread the Russia hoax for years.
[00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.779]  You called the Hunter Biden story a manufactured story.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.881]  Basically, you called every story that you didn't like right-wing disinformation.
[00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:13.202]  And I can go on and on.
[00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:15.663]  So have some self-respect in front of these people.
[00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:18.664]  Realize why your ratings went down the toilet.
[00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:22.004]   And I'm not going to call you a Mr. Potato Head because that's a cheap shot.
[00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:39.125]  It's Thursday, December 14th, 2023.
[00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.274]  I thought you'd want to have some comedy to lighten you up a bit because we got some really bad news for everybody.
[00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:48.538]  Everything that I predicted is now happening exactly as I said it would happen.
[00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:51.921]  They're now foiling massive terror attack plans in Europe.
[00:05:53.692 --> 00:05:56.234]  England says they're bracing for it imminently, so is the U.S.
[00:05:57.054 --> 00:06:05.860]  And there are real Islamic terrorists they brought in, or the Globalist may just stage it, but this adds into all the other key points I said that would manifest if they're getting ready to bring in total martial law.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.620]  Stay with us.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:20.729]  If you're receiving this transmission, ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, December 14th, 2023, and I am your embattled host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:24.787]  Returning triumphantly from exile.
[00:06:28.248 --> 00:06:39.372]  Because of your support, and your prayer, not just this broadcast, which is a microcosm of humanity, but all of humanity, has a real fighting chance against the forces of death.
[00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:40.752]  The Death Cult.
[00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:42.493]  The New World Order.
[00:06:44.674 --> 00:06:47.755]  It's gonna be a TKO, if we keep moving against the enemy.
[00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.739]  All right.
[00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:58.101]  Stu Peters, very interesting, informative, energetic person, will be in studio with us in the third hour.
[00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:04.203]  I intend to have open phones at the end of this hour and in the second hour.
[00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:16.187]  And, you know, I've talked about what's in the cards and that if they follow a certain path, we would know what they were going to do from pre-programming we had already done, but that they hadn't gone full tilt with.
[00:07:16.847 --> 00:07:43.158]   But if they went Full push with cyber attacks, race war is imminent, Islamic groups are about to launch terror attacks, foiled terror attacks, escalate the war with Russia, we've got to give you the central bank digital currencies right now, completely dissolve the border even more, that if they did that, we would know they were going to go for broke.
[00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:46.761]  And that's the really bad news I got to give you.
[00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:52.211]  Let's put it up on screen how many days out we are from the most important election in world history.
[00:07:53.432 --> 00:08:29.696]   And today is the most important day before the election and tomorrow will be the most important day and so on and so forth because the question with 326 days, 12 hours, 51 minutes, 40 seconds left is what are you going to do to spread the word and to warn the people because if we get enough heat on the globalists and their minions They will not have the support, and there'll be more whistleblowers going public, that will stop World War III, and it'll stop them pulling a cyber attack to be blamed on MAGA, which they've already got pre-programmed, and so much more.
[00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:33.317]  But they have got the truck bombs loaded, in my view.
[00:08:34.338 --> 00:08:38.799]  They've got the crazy mass shooters on meth and PCP in hotel rooms ready.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.661]  They've got the Islamic sleeper cells ready.
[00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:44.882]  They've got it all ready to go.
[00:08:46.874 --> 00:09:05.927]  This is a more important time and a more consequential time and a more dangerous time than we were in in World War I, World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, you name it.
[00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:09.430]  Better be saying your prayers.
[00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.411]  Better be kissing your children next to you.
[00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:13.052]  Better be hugging your wife and your husband.
[00:09:13.713 --> 00:09:16.335]  Better be getting on your knees more to God.
[00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:21.089]  Because, I've known this is coming for decades.
[00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:22.210]  Tried to stop it.
[00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.251]  We didn't stop it, but at least we're not gonna be caught flat-footed.
[00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:28.592]  And I'm 50 years old, folks.
[00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:29.892]  50 years old in a month and a half.
[00:09:31.813 --> 00:09:34.634]  And, I wouldn't say I'm shook up.
[00:09:36.835 --> 00:09:37.835]  I'm more blown away.
[00:09:38.355 --> 00:09:43.637]  Because I look around at the average person, who knows something's wrong, but man, they don't know how wrong.
[00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.058]  Woooo boy!
[00:09:46.221 --> 00:10:07.118]  I mean, from the bottom of my heart and the depths of my mind and my greatest intellect, I'm saying, not that I'm the greatest intellect, I'm saying from my greatest intellectual political research, man, ladies and gentlemen, we got some crazy people in control and it looks like they're going to go all the way to World War III.
[00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:13.333]  And this is going to be beyond a SH-T sandwich we've all got to take a bite out of.
[00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:15.815]  This is a cyanide sandwich, folks.
[00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.817]  Because a crap sandwich just tastes bad.
[00:10:18.877 --> 00:10:19.558]  Might get you sick.
[00:10:20.158 --> 00:10:22.700]  Cyanide sandwich will kill you dead in a hammer in about 30 seconds.
[00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:35.391]  So... I just want to pause here for all the dead from the poison shots and all the dead from the evil wars and all the dead from the fentanyl and the human trafficking and just everything.
[00:10:36.867 --> 00:10:49.371]  And just pause because it almost kind of feels weird to just be a commentator here on air like giving analysis instead of a boxing match the potential end of the world.
[00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:56.032]  But it's a big complex world and there was some heroic action I could take to stop this.
[00:10:56.312 --> 00:10:58.013]  I would do it, but there's none.
[00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:01.655]  Because it's a fight between good versus evil.
[00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:04.837]  And the fight goes on in all our hearts and all our minds.
[00:11:05.158 --> 00:11:12.103]  And good has finally woken up and is rising, as Newtonian physics shows, for every action there's an opposite-equal reaction.
[00:11:13.084 --> 00:11:16.647]  And evil is not being driven off its quarry very easily.
[00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:20.190]  And it's pulling out all the stops right now.
[00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:23.893]  New viral releases, you can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:11:26.535 --> 00:11:28.577]  Last one killed some of my friends, almost killed my family.
[00:11:31.084 --> 00:11:32.464]  You're not pissed, you're not paying attention.
[00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:36.926]  Open mobilization for full World War III with Russia being announced.
[00:11:39.006 --> 00:11:41.867]  Satanic idols being put in capitals everywhere.
[00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:49.670]  Mainstream media promoting pedophilia and sacrificing babies to Satan and saying it's legal to kill your baby before it's born.
[00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.491]  Here's a satanic abortuary where you can drink the blood of your child.
[00:11:55.672 --> 00:11:56.372]  Cosmopolitan.
[00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.192]  New York Times.
[00:11:58.292 --> 00:12:00.033]  I mean, it's just, it's all Twilight Zone.
[00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:08.075]  And then, you know, 20 million Muslims brought in the last 15 years into Europe, conservatively.
[00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:10.597]  80-something percent military-age men.
[00:12:11.658 --> 00:12:13.699]  Raping, robbing, sex trafficking, killing.
[00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:15.741]  90% of them never get a job.
[00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:16.301]  It's a fact.
[00:12:19.924 --> 00:12:21.105]  Millions of them brought in here.
[00:12:21.486 --> 00:12:25.209]  I'm not saying all Muslims are bad, but these are military guys coming across now.
[00:12:25.229 --> 00:12:27.170]  We've got the videos with reporters we've had in the studio.
[00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.971]  They're military.
[00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:31.602]  And it's on.
[00:12:33.843 --> 00:12:34.243]  It's on.
[00:12:36.984 --> 00:12:46.767]  And I looked right at my wife this morning while I was flipping eggs and putting some toast in the toaster.
[00:12:47.507 --> 00:12:51.748]  And I looked right at her and I said, let me tell you, you better get your mind ready because it's going down.
[00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:52.208]  You understand?
[00:12:53.108 --> 00:12:54.109]  She's like, yeah, what do we do?
[00:12:54.609 --> 00:13:00.250]   And I said, well, we're not going to haul ass to the Southern Hemisphere.
[00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.613]  You don't want to do that, do you?
[00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:04.073]  No?
[00:13:06.354 --> 00:13:07.575]  Well, we better get the word out.
[00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:08.316]  We better stop this.
[00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:13.559]  And I told her, and I was not lecturing her.
[00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:14.420]  I was lecturing myself.
[00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:24.967]  I said, all this petty crap, the stuff that goes on in families and neighbors and friends and all this stupid stuff, I don't want to hear about it.
[00:13:27.284 --> 00:13:36.468]  It's time for us to grow up, and we're already grown up, we're already good people overall, but I mean, I'm telling myself this, I said, I'm telling myself this, we gotta get our heads screwed on perfectly straight.
[00:13:37.088 --> 00:13:39.249]  Not a couple degrees off, straight.
[00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:47.493]  The average American's got their head turned around sideways, the left's got it turned around backwards, you gotta have that son of a bitch pointed perfectly straight.
[00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:51.996]  Because your life is like a rifle and a long-distance scope.
[00:13:52.056 --> 00:13:54.937]  It's got to be dead on to get the job done.
[00:13:55.497 --> 00:14:01.518]  And you can't dial in your spirit to that level.
[00:14:01.678 --> 00:14:02.819]  Only the Holy Spirit can do it.
[00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:06.520]  I told her, I said, you better be praying.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.340]  You better be getting on your knees a lot.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.001]  She said, I agree.
[00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:11.661]  I pray all the time.
[00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:12.061]  I said, I don't.
[00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:18.560]  And then I went in the room, bedroom, closed the door, and got on my damn knees for 30 minutes.
[00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:21.561]  I didn't ask God for anything.
[00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:23.002]  I just said, show me what to do.
[00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:28.284]  On your face, 30 minutes.
[00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:31.045]  You're gonna get that out of some Christian book.
[00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:32.025]  That's what I do.
[00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:32.785]  That's what you should do.
[00:14:33.545 --> 00:14:34.486]  I got up about 3 a.m.
[00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.847]  in the morning, got on my face for at least 15 minutes.
[00:14:36.887 --> 00:14:41.228]  Well, the starlight comes in the window.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.584]  Because that's the only thing that's going to save us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:50.065 --> 00:14:51.567]  Donald Trump's not going to save us.
[00:14:51.607 --> 00:14:53.188]  Tucker Carlson's not going to save us.
[00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:54.590]  Alex Jones isn't going to save us.
[00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.211]  You're not going to save us.
[00:14:57.773 --> 00:14:58.713]  God's going to save us.
[00:14:59.174 --> 00:14:59.614]  We'll go to break.
[00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:07.602]  Come back and get into the Hamas plot to carry out attacks on civilians in Europe is foiled as Danish cops arrest seven.
[00:15:08.643 --> 00:15:09.644]  It's all about to start.
[00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:14.045]  Yeah, we got the Ace of Spades.
[00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:15.886]  It's called God the Creating Universe.
[00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:20.087]  And if you're not dialed into that channel, you can kiss your ass goodbye.
[00:15:22.728 --> 00:15:25.589]  But fear not, who can kill the body, Phil, he can kill the soul.
[00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.810]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:39.354]  Did you guys pull up that famous painting of George Washington kneeling by his horse, praying in the snow before the battle at Valley Forge?
[00:15:42.932 --> 00:15:43.492]  Which was true.
[00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:45.533]  They wrote that in the letters, the history about it.
[00:15:45.573 --> 00:15:46.573]  He always prayed a lot.
[00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:47.974]  Sometimes hours a day.
[00:15:47.994 --> 00:15:50.854]  If he was not in public, he'd go walk off in the woods by himself.
[00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:54.676]  And these are the times, folks.
[00:15:55.636 --> 00:15:58.357]  There should be no atheists in foxholes.
[00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:00.437]  Just make no mistake.
[00:16:00.978 --> 00:16:02.178]  That's what we're in, is a war.
[00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:04.579]  All right.
[00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:10.189]   If you just joined us and missed yesterday's show, I think it's important to note that There's not just two.
[00:16:10.229 --> 00:16:11.510]  I played trailers for two of them.
[00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:27.283]  There's at least five Hollywood-produced movies, one of them by Obama right now, that's already out, leaving forever, and it's about power outages and cyber attacks and then race war.
[00:16:28.444 --> 00:16:32.227]  And then there's another movie, Civil War, that's about the same thing, and it's race war.
[00:16:33.007 --> 00:16:43.865]   They're getting ready to turn the power off, and I predicted they would do this, Because they were saying, right-wingers, right-wingers are attacking the power grid with no proof in the last few years.
[00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:46.806]  And then they started saying Russians are going to attack it.
[00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:51.048]  And I said, yeah, when they get ready to do it, they're going to say the Russians working with MAGA did it.
[00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:58.431]  Three months later, the FBI came out with internal memos saying, we believe the Russians control the Trump supporters.
[00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:00.592]  Remember all the bull, they control Trump?
[00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:01.313]  Now they control you.
[00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:02.033]  You didn't know that?
[00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:06.415]  And they're going to turn the power off.
[00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:08.196]  I mean, just preposterous.
[00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:16.947]   Meanwhile, The World Economic Forum, even before that, the North American Union meetings in 2007 that we got documents on that Lou Dobbs sued and got.
[00:17:16.967 --> 00:17:19.470]  Remember back when he had the top show on CNN, remember that?
[00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:21.613]  How the heck would CNN have Lou Dobbs on?
[00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:22.574]  How would the world change?
[00:17:23.294 --> 00:17:33.633]   And it said, we're going to use viruses, cyber attacks, And giant migrant hordes to bring in the new world order.
[00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.874]  We're going to overwhelm the nation states and use that.
[00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:37.535]  And they put in Operation Lockstep 2011.
[00:17:37.816 --> 00:17:46.321]  We're going to use a virus to lock things down and bring in a world ID and make everybody wear a mask and all this crap.
[00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:51.245]  And so now, what have I been saying for the last few years?
[00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:56.186]  Right before the 2024 election, if they go with the plan, I see them pre-programming.
[00:17:56.226 --> 00:17:57.666]  It's not hard to know once you know the enemy.
[00:17:57.926 --> 00:18:01.087]  And they usually just regurgitate previous plans, but mix them together.
[00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:14.790]  I said, when they start saying cyber attacks run by domestic groups, imminent race war, totally collapsed borders, wars with Russia, when you see that, baby, you know they're getting ready to drop the hammer.
[00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:21.878]   And the old bubbles collapsing, They're collapsing it on purpose with the interest rates going up and they're bringing in the New World Order.
[00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:23.860]  The angrier world.
[00:18:25.181 --> 00:18:27.123]  But they think they won't get the blame.
[00:18:27.423 --> 00:18:29.825]  They think we'll all just kill each other and think it's black and white.
[00:18:31.787 --> 00:18:32.707]  And that's why it happened.
[00:18:32.727 --> 00:18:34.509]  That's why they're branding it like that everywhere.
[00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:41.094]  Because if you're the mega bankers that have done all this and started all these wars, you gotta have the people kill each other so they don't ever unify against you.
[00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:41.855]  It's real simple.
[00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:42.596]  Divide and conquer.
[00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.218]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:18:46.277 --> 00:18:47.698]  They pretty much already started a race war.
[00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:51.982]  It's one-sided, the white people are just being slaughtered, murdered, and killed, and raped everywhere.
[00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:58.207]  It's a small minority of black people doing it, but it's huge, and no one can deny it's going on because they're buying the propaganda.
[00:18:59.949 --> 00:19:04.633]  Why else, every few hours, black-armed robbers will just shoot somebody for no reason, they carjack.
[00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:10.078]  And they'll later say, because they get caught, they go, ah, kill the white bastards.
[00:19:11.854 --> 00:19:16.358]  But that's the white liberals you see worshipping Black Lives Matter three years ago, two years ago.
[00:19:17.439 --> 00:19:18.780]  They know it's their political power.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.541]  They even know what they're doing.
[00:19:21.482 --> 00:19:25.405]  All those professors and establishment types.
[00:19:26.846 --> 00:19:28.207]  They're running the PSYOP.
[00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:31.270]  And even down to the low level, they know it's a takeover.
[00:19:32.824 --> 00:19:35.986]  The black people don't know it, not because they're stupid, because they're not on the inside.
[00:19:36.786 --> 00:19:38.507]  And the average white people don't know it.
[00:19:39.087 --> 00:19:43.109]  Not because they're stupid, because they're not in the Communist Party.
[00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:49.933]  And at the grassroots, it's a communist, Maoist operation, Confucian societies, everything.
[00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:51.314]  It's not a communist conspiracy.
[00:19:51.614 --> 00:19:55.296]  Above that's the globalists, but that's how they read them into this operation.
[00:19:56.816 --> 00:19:57.857]  Mostly peaceful protest.
[00:19:59.972 --> 00:20:03.694]  So people better get this and you better get it fast.
[00:20:04.514 --> 00:20:23.555]   How many statements did I make the last couple years where I said they're letting in record numbers of military Islamic men at some point they're going to trigger attacks by them or stage them but as many Islamists as they got that they're not going to have to and then they're going to use that to bring in martial law And more controls.
[00:20:23.955 --> 00:20:27.939]  And then they think we're so dumb, the corporate media won't say, well, why did Biden open the borders up?
[00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:30.281]  Or why did the FBI not go after these groups?
[00:20:31.682 --> 00:20:39.049]  And then the FBI director, three weeks ago and again last week, to Congress said, imminent terror attacks, red lights are flashing everywhere.
[00:20:39.389 --> 00:20:41.431]  And I said, that's it, it's getting ready to happen.
[00:20:43.513 --> 00:20:45.235]  And look at this new video just shot yesterday.
[00:20:47.136 --> 00:20:52.417]  Of tens of thousands of people getting ready to go in across the border.
[00:20:53.678 --> 00:20:54.838]  These videos go on for hours.
[00:20:56.798 --> 00:21:03.040]  And they're from the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.261]  And they're saying, thank you, Joe Biden.
[00:21:07.341 --> 00:21:08.181]  Thank you, Joe Biden.
[00:21:09.517 --> 00:21:13.418]  USAID debit cards of up to $5,000 a piece.
[00:21:13.878 --> 00:21:16.799]  As they get to each new level, they're told to go to these facilities, U.N.
[00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.940]  facilities, and they recharge a couple thousand dollars on them.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.600]  That's in Reuters.
[00:21:23.101 --> 00:21:27.662]  Look at this footage if you're a TV viewer.
[00:21:27.682 --> 00:21:28.662]  $12,000 a day they're catching.
[00:21:30.543 --> 00:21:33.343]  They estimate 80% are getaways.
[00:21:33.864 --> 00:21:35.124]  They never even make contact with them.
[00:21:36.917 --> 00:21:39.339]  And the Border Patrol's there with bulldozers with the U.S.
[00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:45.162]  Army ramming over any fences Texas puts up and ordering water barriers be taken down.
[00:21:47.143 --> 00:21:50.946]  And our own reporters, we're going down there again soon, had the U.S.
[00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:55.168]  Army walk up to them with their hands on their guns and their fingers and say, what's your problem?
[00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:56.029]  Get out of here!
[00:21:57.009 --> 00:21:57.930]  You're not allowed to be here!
[00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:04.648]  And you're 100 feet from the border fence and they're bringing illegals through because they're covering up the crime.
[00:22:04.868 --> 00:22:07.130]  It's all you that lionize the military and the police.
[00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.372]  Yeah, on average, they're good people.
[00:22:09.473 --> 00:22:11.474]  I'd say on average, you know, I think they're good people.
[00:22:12.896 --> 00:22:16.339]  It's a good honorable American profession, but they're following globalist orders, folks.
[00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:22.285]  So if you think they're going to save you, no.
[00:22:23.953 --> 00:22:27.675]  They need leadership, governors and legislatures and attorney generals.
[00:22:28.316 --> 00:22:30.637]  They need to be commanded to do the right thing.
[00:22:31.838 --> 00:22:36.081]  They're not in those positions to make the decisions themselves.
[00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:39.343]  Now, Nuremberg Code common sense, following orders doesn't cut it.
[00:22:39.543 --> 00:22:41.264]  So they commit crimes, they will be held accountable.
[00:22:41.284 --> 00:22:56.436]   But do not expect people trained in law enforcement or the military, particularly in America today, With all the wokeism and brainwashing and purges to do the right thing when it comes into clench time.
[00:22:56.456 --> 00:22:58.437]  And that was the big problem I had with the Q phenomenon.
[00:22:58.497 --> 00:22:59.678]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:22:59.698 --> 00:23:00.779]  The military's on our side.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.282]  The entire Joint Chiefs of Staff and the top thousand brass are New World Order.
[00:23:06.563 --> 00:23:09.424]  They write white papers, say they want to get rid of America.
[00:23:10.885 --> 00:23:18.070]  They have top professors at the Army War College and others that, like Thomas Barnett, that wrote white papers about the New World Order and getting rid of sovereignty.
[00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:25.294]  He told me personally, in front of John Harmon one day.
[00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:27.956]  We got him on as a guest.
[00:23:28.496 --> 00:23:31.658]  He thought I was Alex Jones of the New York Times, back when that guy was still prominent.
[00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:32.919]  Thought he was on NPR.
[00:23:35.084 --> 00:23:38.906]  And he goes, wait, is that Alex Jones, the conspiracy guy?
[00:23:39.146 --> 00:23:40.427]  And John's got him on the phone.
[00:23:41.068 --> 00:23:43.189]  And I get on the phone with him and he goes, I'm not coming on your show.
[00:23:43.209 --> 00:23:44.289]  I thought this was Alex S. Jones.
[00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.290]  I said, let's just shoot.
[00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.491]  He goes, you'll never defeat our new Baltimore.
[00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:48.612]  We're going to catch you.
[00:23:49.252 --> 00:23:50.633]  Like a game, we're going to catch you.
[00:23:50.693 --> 00:23:51.493]  Right in front of John Harmon.
[00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:53.515]  I said, no, we're going to kick your ass.
[00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:55.956]  He goes, go to hell.
[00:23:57.037 --> 00:23:58.417]  That's who they are.
[00:23:59.518 --> 00:24:02.059]  He sees me as an enemy because I'm an American.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:02.900]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:13.185]  All right, I'm gonna open the phones up, after I cover some more news here in a few minutes, on a huge topic, but it's on this topic for first-time callers.
[00:24:14.006 --> 00:24:15.807]  First-time callers on this huge topic.
[00:24:17.048 --> 00:24:58.751]   The global destabilization, the cascade of crises, the massive hype of imminent cyber attacks run by evil domestic groups, or China or Russia, All these populists getting elected everywhere, foiled Islamic terror attacks, completely open borders, and the big one, several big ones, Fauci and others hyping imminent new virus is about to arrive, UN global health care treaty to take over your body, already calling for new lockdowns, they're trying, it's failing, and then the big one, the big daddy, the German Chancellor yesterday, the new
[00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:21.208]   Polish leader all saying we're mobilizing for total war with Russia because Ukraine's losing and preparing to declare civil emergencies on the heels of Biden two weeks ago and then Lloyd Austin a week ago and Blinken a week ago the Secretary of State saying Our sons and daughters are about to be dying.
[00:25:21.228 --> 00:25:22.089]  The U.S.
[00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:27.770]  military is going to have to fight Russia because they're about to attack NATO countries with no proof.
[00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.651]  That tells you they're going to false flag.
[00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:32.151]  This is very easy when you know their operations.
[00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:41.654]  Yes, we have madmen like Hitler or Stalin in control of our government right now.
[00:25:43.424 --> 00:25:44.325]  They are at war with us.
[00:25:44.365 --> 00:25:45.226]  They're at war with the world.
[00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:46.447]  They're on a complete power trip.
[00:25:46.807 --> 00:25:47.868]  They've got nuclear weapons.
[00:25:47.968 --> 00:25:54.374]  And imagine you get a megalomaniac with 20,000 nuclear weapons and all the delivery systems.
[00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:56.796]  They want total control and they want it now.
[00:25:57.136 --> 00:25:59.638]  And the end of their giant bubble is here.
[00:25:59.718 --> 00:26:00.979]  They can't prop it up anymore.
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:16.182]   So they're positioning a global crisis to bring in The Central Bank, digital currencies, and all the rest of it, and then they just use the Justice Departments of the Western countries to prosecute and persecute their political opposition, and then have staged elections moving forward, just like Venezuela does.
[00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:18.606]  Whether you're in Brazil...
[00:26:20.239 --> 00:26:21.020]  Or Argentina?
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.102]  Or Venezuela?
[00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:25.064]  Or if you look at Europe?
[00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:26.846]  Or if you look at the U.S.?
[00:26:27.787 --> 00:26:31.270]  Criminal charges for leading political parties and candidates.
[00:26:32.011 --> 00:26:36.576]  Venezuela just arrested a political party that even in their own polls was going to win big.
[00:26:37.116 --> 00:26:38.798]  They just arrested the leadership last week.
[00:26:39.979 --> 00:26:43.403]  They've indicted Javier Mele, the president.
[00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.130]  For nothing.
[00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.392]  For saying that the communists devalued the currency.
[00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:47.992]  It's true.
[00:26:48.412 --> 00:26:49.773]  They say he devalued it when they did it.
[00:26:50.293 --> 00:26:51.214]  Before he ever got in office.
[00:26:53.115 --> 00:26:54.016]  The indictments of Trump.
[00:26:55.096 --> 00:26:56.737]  The impending indictments of Bolsonaro.
[00:26:57.818 --> 00:27:01.760]  The government, under the State Department directive, banning him from running for office for eight years.
[00:27:02.861 --> 00:27:04.342]  Can't challenge Lula.
[00:27:07.897 --> 00:27:12.238]  The examples go on and on and on and then a new report I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:13.259]  Will you guys pull it out of the stack?
[00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:13.699]  I forgot.
[00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:14.739]  Just go to my links.
[00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:15.420]  I sent it yesterday.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.141]  Klaus Schwab comes out and says, cyber attacks are the number one threat.
[00:27:21.722 --> 00:27:32.445]  They put a report out and they said, we define a cyber attack now as anyone challenging our agenda that we define as disinformation.
[00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:36.247]  And what does the EU, what does the UN, what do they all say?
[00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:37.988]  Oh, we're losing because of disinfo.
[00:27:38.328 --> 00:27:47.671]  What, that the masks don't work, and you cooked up the virus, and the shot doesn't work, and so it makes you sick, and you got rid of the borders, and you look at Congress, half of them went to Jeffrey Epstein's island.
[00:27:47.731 --> 00:28:06.692]   I mean, you're bad people, you're liars, you're criminals, you're insider traitors, you've gotten away with murder, and now if Congress won't give you $106 billion to launder through Ukraine, You tell us, well, we'll just go to full nuclear war.
[00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:13.917]  There it is, WF Likens, misinformation, a cybersecurity issue, and calls for more action.
[00:28:13.977 --> 00:28:18.200]  And scroll down, I read the report yesterday, I should have covered it, it took an hour to cover it.
[00:28:18.521 --> 00:28:21.023]  Scroll down, there's a link right there to them saying it.
[00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:27.748]  Right, that blue link, troubling report.
[00:28:28.942 --> 00:28:34.725]  And it says, over and over again, anyone not agreeing with us must be censored and controlled.
[00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:39.087]  And they admit that they are losing the information war.
[00:28:39.127 --> 00:28:40.888]  Yeah, because you're a pack of liars.
[00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:45.490]  Mayorkas, until a week ago, was saying the border was under control.
[00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:48.572]  Now he says it's a big crisis, because he knows you're not buying it.
[00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:52.114]  So now he wants you to believe he's trying to fix it, just like Hochul in New York.
[00:28:53.634 --> 00:28:56.356]  The governor or the mayor, oh, we never said illegals come here.
[00:28:56.596 --> 00:28:58.317]  We have all the clips of you telling them to come there.
[00:28:59.636 --> 00:29:00.276]  And they're coming!
[00:29:01.557 --> 00:29:03.539]  They caught 12,000 in one day!
[00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:06.361]  It's a joke!
[00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:16.508]  All the videos of highways in Texas and highways in Arizona, just African military men just running around.
[00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:22.493]  They're obviously not military, then it shows the Islamists all running in formation, all wearing the same boots.
[00:29:25.892 --> 00:29:29.174]  First thing you do, you don't need to have a training in the military to know intelligence.
[00:29:29.995 --> 00:29:30.855]  You gotta have a brain.
[00:29:32.577 --> 00:29:47.126]  When you see a whole bunch of men running in unison, and they all look about 30, it means they're seasoned, and they're all wearing the same boots, and they're all covering their faces, but all the rest of them, illegal aliens, are like, oh yeah, I'm here to get the free stuff!
[00:29:47.347 --> 00:29:48.828]  We love buying, these guys are like, don't look at me!
[00:29:50.928 --> 00:29:54.451]  Sir, and I've talked to the state police, and I've talked to others in the last 48 hours.
[00:29:57.994 --> 00:30:00.716]  When they try to stop these guys, they start shooting at them, all of it.
[00:30:00.797 --> 00:30:02.638]  I mean, it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:03.819 --> 00:30:07.542]  Yeah, show the Anthony Rubin footage of the Islamic men.
[00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:10.044]  They're all wearing the same boots.
[00:30:12.506 --> 00:30:14.168]  So that's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:15.882 --> 00:30:17.063]  They are destroying the country.
[00:30:17.163 --> 00:30:22.388]  The globalists are creating a crisis so bad that then you'll beg for the central government to come in and take control.
[00:30:22.928 --> 00:30:24.790]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.291]  So that's what we're talking about.
[00:30:26.311 --> 00:30:27.732]  That giant waterfront.
[00:30:28.073 --> 00:30:31.015]  The organized collapse of civilization.
[00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:34.058]  And yeah, look at these guys.
[00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:36.380]  Look at their boots.
[00:30:37.861 --> 00:30:38.642]  All the same boots.
[00:30:39.743 --> 00:30:40.243]  Hundreds of them.
[00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:41.444]  Goes on down the road.
[00:30:42.386 --> 00:30:43.266]  That's the front of the line.
[00:30:44.086 --> 00:30:45.887]  Same make, same brand, same everything.
[00:30:47.827 --> 00:30:50.508]  And notice they're not 18, they're not 25, they're 30, they're 40.
[00:30:51.608 --> 00:30:53.328]  These are guys infiltrating the United States.
[00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:56.429]  That's actual Red Dawn you're witnessing.
[00:30:56.489 --> 00:31:02.571]  And they'll set up prostitution and meth rings and fentanyl rings to fund their criminal operations.
[00:31:03.771 --> 00:31:05.391]  And they'll carjack and they'll do it all.
[00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:08.812]  And the police are ordered to not even respond.
[00:31:10.814 --> 00:31:12.095]  And they'll finance their operation.
[00:31:12.415 --> 00:31:13.435]  And then they'll attack us.
[00:31:14.256 --> 00:31:15.637]  And then Hezbollah won't get in trouble.
[00:31:15.877 --> 00:31:16.957]  Hamas won't get in trouble.
[00:31:17.398 --> 00:31:19.479]  You'll get your genitals grubbed at the airport.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.861]  So let's go over these headlines.
[00:31:24.021 --> 00:31:30.485]  Hamas plot to carry out attack on civilians in Europe is foiled as Danish cops arrest seven suspects who are operating on behalf of terror group.
[00:31:32.126 --> 00:31:33.366]  Hamas terror plot foiled.

[00:31:42.546 --> 00:31:48.430]  The United Kingdom is vulnerable to catastrophic cyber attack that could cripple large sections of its most critical infrastructure.
[00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.432]  Oh, like they're doing, shutting off the energy, locking people in their houses?
[00:31:51.452 --> 00:31:54.694]  Schwab said, next we do the cyber attack.
[00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:57.756]  And a parliamentary report has warned.
[00:32:00.178 --> 00:32:02.480]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.220]  Look at this.
[00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:10.643]   Shocking new poll finds one in five voters Admit to mail-in voter fraud in the 2020 election.
[00:32:10.684 --> 00:32:12.226]  Let that sink in.
[00:32:13.187 --> 00:32:18.734]  Bizarre Etsy listings, pedophile-style listings, spark conspiracy theories.
[00:32:18.775 --> 00:32:19.996]  Newsweek's reporting on that.
[00:32:21.038 --> 00:32:24.362]  The Trojan horse that would force your barista to spy on you.
[00:32:25.612 --> 00:32:30.478]  Breaking Congress passes resolution to formally open impeachment inquiry against Biden.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.000]  Huge news!
[00:32:32.862 --> 00:32:41.233]  Canadian government reports 300% increase in unspecified causes of death, sparking calls for investigation.
[00:32:41.253 --> 00:32:42.715]  Got a bunch of other news on that front.
[00:32:45.066 --> 00:32:50.693]  Democrat Boston mayor holds secret no whites allowed holiday party accidentally sends invite to white council members.
[00:32:50.713 --> 00:32:51.493]  What's really behind that?

[00:32:53.296 --> 00:32:57.060]  The ESG goes in with the IBM head saying no more white people.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.961]  We don't hire white people.
[00:32:58.702 --> 00:32:59.523]  That's the CEO.

[00:33:27.131 --> 00:33:33.410]   When castles towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor,
[00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.891]  there came an unforeseen darkness.
[00:33:36.196 --> 00:33:43.258]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:45.318]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:51.139]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil, a radiant light descended from the heavens.
[00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:55.980]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.101]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[00:34:01.381 --> 00:34:05.022]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[00:34:05.602 --> 00:34:13.023]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[00:34:13.704 --> 00:34:19.565]  And now it's Alex Jones, leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.
[00:34:19.965 --> 00:34:24.965]  tune in at Infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:34:24.965 --> 00:34:27.965]  [sound of a plane taking off]
[00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:29.965]  [sound of a click]
[00:34:29.965 --> 00:34:35.965]   Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we had Jack Posobiec here on the broadcast,
[00:34:35.965 --> 00:34:45.465]   real expert on geopolitics, and I concur with his analysis, that they're getting ready to bring Ukraine officially into
[00:34:45.465 --> 00:34:49.285]   NATO, even though they promised they would never do it and said
[00:34:49.285 --> 00:34:50.965]  that Putin was a conspiracy theorist.
[00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:52.638]  And Putin said, no, I know you are.
[00:34:52.938 --> 00:35:01.225]  And if you continue to attack our people in the country and in the East, we're going to invade to kick your forces back from those areas.
[00:35:03.087 --> 00:35:12.455]  And I said, I believe them bringing them into NATO is imminent because Biden said two weeks ago, Russia's about to attack NATO.
[00:35:12.475 --> 00:35:18.360]  Well, it's been NATO attacking Russia and starting the whole thing the last nine years, overthrowing the elected government nine years ago.
[00:35:20.438 --> 00:35:23.299]  And I went, yeah, he's not going to attack a real NATO country.
[00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:29.621]  They're going to play the game of saying, you're now NATO and you've attacked NATO.
[00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:31.441]  Oh, like they're in a time machine.
[00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:32.761]  Well, guess what just broke?
[00:35:35.102 --> 00:35:46.025]  Germany, Poland, Hungary, and others are all now saying, all right, we'll get out of the way so they can join NATO.
[00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:48.946]  See how that works?
[00:35:50.825 --> 00:35:51.585]  Euronews.
[00:35:53.926 --> 00:35:57.726]  We should stand with Ukraine, not just in spirit, but by welcoming it into the EU.
[00:36:00.267 --> 00:36:01.067]  Breaking News!
[00:36:01.247 --> 00:36:07.888]  EU Greenlights Ascension Talks with Ukraine and Moldovia after Viktor Orban lifts veto.
[00:36:08.748 --> 00:36:14.650]  Viktor Orban has been acting like he's neutral, but now who knows how much pressure they put him under.
[00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:17.070]  It just happened.
[00:36:21.428 --> 00:36:29.432]  The 27 leaders of the European Union decided Thursday to begin ascension negotiations with Ukraine and Moldovia to make it look like it's not just about Ukraine.
[00:36:30.272 --> 00:36:35.795]  The bloc also granted Georgia the status of candidate country, having previously been denied such titles.
[00:36:35.815 --> 00:36:40.538]  That's another Eastern bloc country that they're going to put into NATO and put troops on the border with Russia.
[00:36:41.098 --> 00:36:44.499]  A clear signal of hope for the people and for our continent.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:44.860]  Oh yeah.
[00:36:45.993 --> 00:36:49.236]  Said Charlie Mitchell, the President of the European Council.
[00:36:49.556 --> 00:36:57.622]  Additionally, the EU will open negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina once the necessary decree of compliance with the membership criteria is reached.
[00:36:57.642 --> 00:37:01.045]  So they're going to bring the whole Eastern Bloc into NATO.
[00:37:01.745 --> 00:37:04.587]  The deal made in 1991, broken just like Putin said.
[00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.411]  World War III, boys and girls!
[00:37:11.333 --> 00:37:15.176]  And your border's wide open and your dollar's being devalued and inflation's out of control.
[00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:21.824]  But don't worry, they'll set up a nice police state for you because cyber attacks are imminent and terror attacks are imminent for the Muslims.
[00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:30.270]  But the FBI says, and James Carville says, and I had to see these clips because I don't watch a lot of mainstream media, I read the transcripts of the news.
[00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:37.394]  And I was on The War Room today with Steve Bannon, and as soon as that's archived, it was live, I was on there 10 to 10.30 central.
[00:37:38.815 --> 00:37:41.498]  He played a big compilation clip of five or six shows.
[00:37:42.218 --> 00:37:44.481]  Bill Maher, MSNBC, CNN, you name it.
[00:37:45.121 --> 00:37:49.426]  Saying, oh, it's not just all the Trump supporters that are terrorists and the main terror threat.
[00:37:49.626 --> 00:37:50.426]  They're all going to attack.
[00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:53.890]  Now it's all the Christians, the Catholics and the Protestants.
[00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.651]  They're joining.
[00:37:54.911 --> 00:37:56.693]  They've merged and they're terrorists too.
[00:37:58.783 --> 00:37:59.323]  See, you got it?
[00:37:59.664 --> 00:38:05.047]  Anybody against open borders and having your guns taken and drag queen pedophile time, you're a terrorist now.
[00:38:05.507 --> 00:38:08.689]  And, oh, it's just the Trump people are terrorists, as if that's not bad enough.
[00:38:08.989 --> 00:38:10.289]  Now all the Christians are.
[00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.931]  So remind the crew, they'll archive it on Rumble.
[00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:15.492]  That's where you go get Steve Bannon's show.
[00:38:16.073 --> 00:38:17.473]  Pretty please cupcakes on top.
[00:38:17.894 --> 00:38:18.574]  Sprinkle sugar.
[00:38:19.635 --> 00:38:21.496]  And I do want to get to that.
[00:38:22.409 --> 00:38:27.794]  So, because it was just the first four or five minutes of his show, he played a really good compilation, but you know what they're doing.
[00:38:27.975 --> 00:38:28.575]  You're seeing it.
[00:38:28.936 --> 00:38:32.936]  It's unbelievably insane.
[00:38:32.936 --> 00:38:40.936]   All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:50.936]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:38:42.769 --> 00:38:43.590]  Let me just say this.
[00:38:46.283 --> 00:38:48.726]  Why do flus and colds get so bad in the winter?
[00:38:48.767 --> 00:39:02.886]  Well, it's because your skin produces vitamin D, and in every study, the number one cause of viral infection is a lack or a deficiency in vitamin D. Most of the D they sell in stores is synthetic, so it does nothing, and most people have trouble absorbing it, even in the gut.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.422]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:39:05.522 --> 00:39:09.666]  We have the highest quality D3, the two types that are known to be the best at synergy.
[00:39:10.267 --> 00:39:12.169]  80% is one vitamin D, 20% is the other.

[00:41:15.709 --> 00:41:16.129]  Leave it at that.
[00:41:16.149 --> 00:41:17.950]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but I mean, I've talked to them.
[00:41:20.571 --> 00:41:24.813]  Today, I've talked to all of the top talk show hosts.
[00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:25.593]  The top five.
[00:41:25.773 --> 00:41:26.334]  Talk to them all.
[00:41:27.454 --> 00:41:27.874]  Top five.
[00:41:27.894 --> 00:41:28.275]  Talk to them all.
[00:41:29.435 --> 00:41:30.516]  And they're asking me, what do you think of this?
[00:41:30.536 --> 00:41:31.056]  What do you think of that?
[00:41:31.076 --> 00:41:31.636]  They're giving me info.
[00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:32.216]  I'm giving them info.
[00:41:32.496 --> 00:41:34.697]  I mean, we're in the zeitgeist here.
[00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:39.061]  I'm very honored to be in this position.
[00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:42.124]  They all ask me what I think.
[00:41:42.604 --> 00:41:43.606]  And I respect them.
[00:41:43.646 --> 00:41:44.667]  I get a lot of information from them.
[00:41:44.707 --> 00:41:48.631]  But I'm seen as the most dialed in person on this.
[00:41:49.532 --> 00:41:51.735]  I would say Steve Bannon is as informed as I am.
[00:41:52.636 --> 00:41:53.877]  Super wide spectrum understanding.
[00:41:53.897 --> 00:42:01.406]   But other than me and Steve Bannon, There's a lot of smart people, a lot of great people, but they just, a lot of them don't know all the knowledge.
[00:42:02.106 --> 00:42:09.570]  And I'm not saying I know all the knowledge, but I mean I've got full spectrum, the most knowledge of anybody out there, because I'm immersed in this for 35 years.
[00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.632]  30 years on air in April.
[00:42:13.072 --> 00:42:14.713]  And we know what we're talking about.
[00:42:14.773 --> 00:42:22.618]  So the intelligence agencies listen, the governments listen, the corporations listen, the Justice Department listens, they all listen, they all know.
[00:42:23.198 --> 00:42:27.962]   Most of them don't even like what's happening, but they're Compartmentalize and they don't know what to do.
[00:42:28.042 --> 00:42:30.384]  Well, we're here having a larger discussion.

[00:44:58.548 --> 00:45:06.110]   We have thousands A five-star reviews, but the big company that did that with us for over a decade took it away from us and said, you can't have our reviews anymore.
[00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.991]  So we had to launch another review system that had thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:45:10.431 --> 00:45:11.972]  Wintersun, finally back in stock.
[00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:15.113]  Infowars.com.
[00:45:15.353 --> 00:45:17.794]  AI scraped our subconscious and created this.
[00:45:18.414 --> 00:45:22.255]  But I saw this when I was two, three, four years old and recurring dreams.
[00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:23.996]  An archetypal truth.
[00:45:25.016 --> 00:45:26.377]  The reality of the universe.
[00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:29.492]  AI did not create this.
[00:45:30.372 --> 00:45:33.094]  It scraped our vision and gave it back to us.
[00:45:34.054 --> 00:45:36.036]  The unconscious now made conscious.
[00:45:36.716 --> 00:45:38.137]  Hallowed be thy name!

[00:45:52.245 --> 00:45:57.969]  Anybody that says we live in boring times, we are alive and conscious in the middle of this incredible universe.
[00:45:58.929 --> 00:46:00.230]  Recognize God's real.

[00:46:08.195 --> 00:46:12.118]  And I've had these callers, but I'm scared.
[00:46:12.198 --> 00:46:13.059]  It's because you know.
[00:46:14.239 --> 00:46:15.320]  Eternity's on the other side.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.121]  It's already there.
[00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:19.002]  So stop lying to yourself.
[00:46:19.002 --> 00:46:25.441]  A lot of other economic news I'm going to hit.
[00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:29.202]   Hunter Biden, it's entertaining, it's ridiculous, he's arrogant,
[00:46:29.202 --> 00:46:32.082]  but it's a football, it's a diversion.
[00:46:32.082 --> 00:46:37.602]   The arrogance of, "Oh, I comply with the subpoena, this is a public hearing."
[00:46:37.602 --> 00:46:41.201]   Well, they indicted all these Trump people that wouldn't go to the kangaroo court,
[00:46:41.201 --> 00:46:45.212]   that didn't even let Republicans on it, didn't allow the Republican Party to put who they wanted on
[00:46:45.212 --> 00:46:47.762]   the committee, and then they indict Steve Bannon, but...
[00:46:47.762 --> 00:46:49.361]  [stammering]
[00:46:49.361 --> 00:46:51.761]  And then, "Oh, but we're not going to indict Hunter."
[00:46:51.761 --> 00:47:01.761]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:46:53.123 --> 00:46:57.265]  The AOC goes on and says, this was a real subpoena.
[00:46:57.285 --> 00:47:00.546]  I mean, he talked to a crowd.
[00:47:01.947 --> 00:47:06.509]  I guess next time they subpoena me, I'll just go to a press conference and say, I comply with the subpoena.
[00:47:09.719 --> 00:47:11.800]  They know they have idiot constituents.
[00:47:13.981 --> 00:47:21.545]  And so they think their moron constituents, and I guess they will, watch this crap and believe it.
[00:47:22.986 --> 00:47:28.508]  Steve Bannon said this is an illegitimate committee and the Republican lawyers agreed and it was true.
[00:47:28.588 --> 00:47:30.529]  I mean, they appointed who they wanted to.
[00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:31.670]  That doesn't follow the law.
[00:47:32.506 --> 00:47:33.506]  He said, I'm not going to speak at it.
[00:47:33.986 --> 00:47:34.967]  I just went and took the Fifth.
[00:47:34.987 --> 00:47:36.107]  I said, you're a kangaroo committee.
[00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:37.287]  I said, you're fake.
[00:47:37.628 --> 00:47:38.388]  You're a fraud.
[00:47:38.528 --> 00:47:42.489]  Schiff has already falsified three documents we know of in these rigged hearings.
[00:47:42.949 --> 00:47:47.350]  And so you're going to get 98 times, I take the Fifth Amendment because you're a fraud.
[00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.491]  Not because I'm hiding anything.
[00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:49.571]  You are a fraud.
[00:47:50.751 --> 00:47:53.232]  And so for reasons of that, Fifth Amendment, shove it up your ass.
[00:47:53.792 --> 00:47:54.473]  Over and over again.
[00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:56.753]  Because I knew they'd indict me, so I just gave them the Fifth.
[00:47:57.573 --> 00:47:58.594]  Steve did, and they indicted him.
[00:47:59.636 --> 00:48:00.277]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:00.317 --> 00:48:03.720]  Stay with us, little precious crackhead pedophile hunter.
[00:48:04.521 --> 00:48:06.402]  Your calls are 60 seconds away.
[00:48:07.283 --> 00:48:10.126]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now kicking off.
[00:48:11.596 --> 00:48:17.860]  Hour number two on this live Thursday, December 14th, worldwide transmission.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.902]  So if you just joined us, let me briefly recap and go to your calls.
[00:48:21.602 --> 00:48:22.823]  All hell has broken loose.
[00:48:23.684 --> 00:48:36.212]  All the Hollywood and the governments and the intelligence agencies, imminent cyber attacks, power's gonna get cut off, elections disrupted, UK, US, Europe, millions surging across the borders.
[00:48:37.352 --> 00:48:40.254]  The biggest thing is NATO saying war footing.
[00:48:40.614 --> 00:48:48.379]  We're going to just bring Ukraine into NATO and say that any Russian troops there is an attack on NATO and go to full war with Russia.
[00:48:48.779 --> 00:48:49.820]  It's all being announced.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.821]  It's totally insane.
[00:48:51.121 --> 00:48:52.762]  And it's a minor blip on the news.
[00:48:53.342 --> 00:48:55.704]  There's more coverage of, you know, NFL games.
[00:48:57.056 --> 00:49:08.841]  Then there is the entire Ukraine war now, and Zelensky was here a few days ago, we played the club yesterday saying, stop crying Americans, forget your roads, forget your cities, all money go to me now.
[00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:14.623]  I mean you, there's like some Muppet up there, you're watching and you're like, am I on 10 hits of acid?
[00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:17.890]  This is crazy town.
[00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:26.893]  And all these movies about civil war and race war and Obama produced one of them and all these others with all the top Hollywood scum.
[00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:28.593]  I mean, it's going down.
[00:49:31.754 --> 00:49:34.194]  And you look at the average idiot that doesn't even know what's going on.
[00:49:34.214 --> 00:49:36.135]  Can you imagine once this all kicks off?
[00:49:36.595 --> 00:49:37.875]  So how do you see this playing out?
[00:49:37.915 --> 00:49:38.675]  How do we stop it?
[00:49:38.715 --> 00:49:39.516]  Can we stop it?
[00:49:40.636 --> 00:49:44.517]  We're taking your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:45.959 --> 00:49:55.082]  At 877, I'll put it on screen for TV viewers, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[00:49:56.202 --> 00:49:57.843]  And now, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:49:58.403 --> 00:50:00.204]  Matt, thanks for calling from Tennessee.
[00:50:00.244 --> 00:50:00.784]  Matt, go ahead.
[00:50:02.284 --> 00:50:03.525]  Alex, first time, long time.
[00:50:03.565 --> 00:50:04.125]  Love you, man.
[00:50:04.385 --> 00:50:05.185]  Love your products.
[00:50:06.386 --> 00:50:10.127]  I'm a 101st Army veteran here in Tennessee.
[00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:18.852]  And actually, I applied to a local police department here and they actually almost threatened to not hire me because I had one of your bumper stickers on my car.
[00:50:19.653 --> 00:50:20.473]  Oh yeah, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:20.493 --> 00:50:25.855]  I mean, they tell the military, as you know, that the army don't even support Trump or you're going to get demoted.
[00:50:26.096 --> 00:50:27.796]  And then of course, they had to say, well, that's illegal.
[00:50:27.816 --> 00:50:28.577]  We're going to stop that.
[00:50:28.617 --> 00:50:34.339]  But yeah, you got a bunch of people that just think sucking up to the establishment is going to get them ahead.
[00:50:34.359 --> 00:50:35.960]  And that's why our country is basically gone.
[00:50:36.914 --> 00:50:41.597]  Oh yeah, well they said I was an anti-Semite and racist because I had an InfoWars bumper sticker.
[00:50:41.717 --> 00:50:43.399]  But that's another thing.
[00:50:43.639 --> 00:50:50.343]  But I've watched us in the last two years of this war expend most of our stores of ordnance and ammunition.
[00:50:50.704 --> 00:50:52.245]  You know, our military's depleted.
[00:50:53.365 --> 00:50:54.806]  We can't enlist enough people.
[00:50:55.267 --> 00:50:58.089]  Every month they're missing their enlistment goals.
[00:50:58.829 --> 00:51:02.652]  And I've talked to multiple guys in the SF community here.
[00:51:03.266 --> 00:51:17.370]  That have told me that in the last two years, they've lost over 60% of the SF community, either from the vaccines or them just retiring because they don't want to deal with it or being forced out or this or that.
[00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.290]  So we've lost our military.
[00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:20.691]  We've lost our munitions.
[00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:22.211]  We can't get people in.
[00:51:22.231 --> 00:51:23.731]  We're losing the SF community.
[00:51:24.492 --> 00:51:29.493]  And now we've got people crossing the border that they showed on, you know, Glenn Beck's program.
[00:51:30.231 --> 00:51:33.495]  You know, these guys from Guinea saying, oh, they're going to come here and join the Marines.
[00:51:34.176 --> 00:51:39.904]  So... Actually, actually, that's what Lloyd Austin and Lincoln said last week.
[00:51:39.924 --> 00:51:42.828]  They said our new military will be illegal aliens.
[00:51:43.652 --> 00:51:46.152]  Yeah, so we're going to have a military full of illegal aliens.
[00:51:46.193 --> 00:51:50.453]  We got our local police departments and state police that are all turning woke.
[00:51:50.733 --> 00:51:51.554]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:51:51.594 --> 00:51:52.014]  It's worse.
[00:51:52.334 --> 00:51:57.155]  Whether it's Illinois or New Mexico or California, they're hiring illegal aliens to be police.
[00:51:57.255 --> 00:51:58.175]  Oh, you figured it out.
[00:51:58.855 --> 00:52:01.095]  These guys being imported are our new bosses.
[00:52:02.076 --> 00:52:03.276]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:03.356 --> 00:52:09.177]  And exactly what they've always said is, well, yeah, Americans won't go against Americans, but it's not going to be Americans anymore.
[00:52:11.385 --> 00:52:13.366]  What do you make of all the cascading crises?
[00:52:13.426 --> 00:52:20.248]  And now, NATO officially saying they're gearing up for direct war by entering Ukraine into NATO, then saying, oh, Russia's now attacked NATO.
[00:52:20.288 --> 00:52:21.228]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:23.409]  Yeah, it's just like you said.
[00:52:23.429 --> 00:52:25.590]  They're going to try and put us on a war on three fronts.
[00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:36.433]  And absolutely, we're going to become a third world nation from losing our military powers, everything, within just a matter of the next year or two at this rate.
[00:52:39.071 --> 00:52:40.192]  Absolutely, my friend.
[00:52:40.252 --> 00:52:57.926]  That is where we are, and that is what is unfolding, and I just hope and pray people wake up and the people inside the power structure will stop following orders, because this is like following Hitler's orders in 1945, a few months before they totally collapsed.
[00:52:57.946 --> 00:52:58.847]  They knew they were going to lose.
[00:52:59.087 --> 00:53:01.489]  They kept following orders, and it's suicidal.
[00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:02.290]  I appreciate your call.
[00:53:03.011 --> 00:53:04.612]  Steven in Utah, thanks for calling.
[00:53:04.632 --> 00:53:05.092]  You're on the air.
[00:53:05.132 --> 00:53:05.433]  Go ahead.
[00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:15.613]  Hey Alex, just in your honest opinion, what is the actual purpose or mission of the CIA and other global intelligence agencies today?
[00:53:15.633 --> 00:53:18.914]  And then what was their original purpose for creation?
[00:53:19.394 --> 00:53:23.656]  And has that changed throughout, you know, last hundred years or are they essentially the same?
[00:53:25.393 --> 00:53:27.694]  Boy, you could write a hundred books on that subject.
[00:53:27.734 --> 00:53:36.119]  I mean, look, we had Army Intelligence and Naval Intelligence and all that before 1947, the National Security Act.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.743]  And then they allowed the CIA to go underground and the NSA to be set up and operate as a separate branch of government.
[00:53:42.283 --> 00:53:48.427]  We had the Federal Reserve Act before that in 1913, which is not a federal agency, but operates independently and without congressional oversight.
[00:53:49.207 --> 00:53:51.028]  And so that's the real beachhead for the coup.
[00:53:52.029 --> 00:53:58.073]  And we basically merged with British intelligence before World War II in 1922 through the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:53:58.533 --> 00:54:02.095]  So it was about America first not being a republic but becoming an empire.
[00:54:02.616 --> 00:54:06.418]  By 1922 we became merged at the hip with the British Empire.
[00:54:07.098 --> 00:54:14.163]  And then they began to recruit people who would just profit and have power with the robber barons of a parlaying American power.
[00:54:14.863 --> 00:54:19.665]   But still, It brought a lot of wealth to the United States, even though the globalists got most of the wealth.
[00:54:20.246 --> 00:54:40.335]  Then, by the mid-70s, and the deals with China, the transfer goes overseas, and the intelligence agencies and the banks around them fully sold America out to be able to get control of China and most of the world, and then they're trying to fully suck us dry to shut up their world government, their world cashless society, so they won't even need governments anymore.
[00:54:41.796 --> 00:54:51.422]  Axing and spiking the old militaries of humans, purposely purging them, not to replace them with communists mainly, but to replace them with robots and AI.
[00:54:51.842 --> 00:54:55.465]  That's why you see the destruction of the military right now to a machine military.
[00:54:55.485 --> 00:54:56.645]  It'll follow orders.
[00:54:57.906 --> 00:55:00.888]  And so people think of intelligence agencies with some esprit de corps.
[00:55:00.928 --> 00:55:02.209]  They're amazing and all this crap.
[00:55:02.649 --> 00:55:08.052]  They're the most compartmentalized, brainwashed, given false information groups out there.
[00:55:09.304 --> 00:55:16.269]  The higher-ups are just swindling money and running offshore bank accounts for their bosses, and it's just purely predatory.
[00:55:16.329 --> 00:55:19.871]  Since 1947, U.S.
[00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:27.096]  intelligence agencies have been the bad guys, but it took them decades to get the anti-communist people out.
[00:55:27.396 --> 00:55:28.937]  They just put them in low-level positions.
[00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:33.457]   and then hung them out to dry later for things they'd done, and then now they basically completed
[00:55:33.457 --> 00:55:45.377]   the transference into a sociopathic globalist whose one skill is to be a criminal and hate America,
[00:55:45.377 --> 00:55:50.337]   and now they're in all the top positions, 99% of them, and so they're making their move on us.
[00:55:50.518 --> 00:55:56.822]  And so, the so-called intelligence agencies are nothing but the proboscis on a mosquito that sucks blood out of you.
[00:55:57.102 --> 00:56:10.389]  They're just the extraction port, you know, like if I walked up to you and knocked a hole in your head and stuck a big metal straw in your brain and sucked your brains out, the CIA is just a straw, but the globalists are the creatures sucking the brains, you understand?
[00:56:11.511 --> 00:56:15.332]  Yeah, when I read Transformation of America, I mean, it completely blew my head wide open.
[00:56:16.333 --> 00:56:17.193]  That's a great answer, man.
[00:56:17.213 --> 00:56:17.753]  I appreciate it.
[00:56:17.773 --> 00:56:18.673]  Appreciate you.
[00:56:19.434 --> 00:56:21.755]  Yeah, the brass is all controlled.
[00:56:22.275 --> 00:56:23.795]  The agencies are all controlled.
[00:56:24.876 --> 00:56:25.976]  Just all a complete joke.
[00:56:26.656 --> 00:56:28.977]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Hunter in North Carolina.
[00:56:28.997 --> 00:56:29.457]  You're on the air.
[00:56:29.477 --> 00:56:29.817]  Go ahead.
[00:56:31.318 --> 00:56:36.079]  Alex, this is Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:40.781]  This is a message to Infovars and the rest of the useless ekers.
[00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:45.712]  There's a little bit of Pfizer in your veins.
[00:56:46.312 --> 00:56:49.013]  You will eat the bugs and not complain.
[00:56:49.033 --> 00:56:52.535]  This is J&J, it's just one shot.
[00:56:53.396 --> 00:56:55.977]  Put some extra pressure in your heart.
[00:56:56.778 --> 00:56:59.179]  This is AstraZeneca in your brain.
[00:56:59.199 --> 00:57:02.801]  The lipid nanoparticles can't contain.
[00:57:02.821 --> 00:57:06.183]  This is Moderna in your heart.
[00:57:06.863 --> 00:57:10.025]  Shed the spike proteins when you fart.
[00:57:10.996 --> 00:57:13.477]  This is Genetic Editing.
[00:57:14.238 --> 00:57:16.659]  You will be happy and know nothing.
[00:57:16.679 --> 00:57:20.901]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[00:57:21.061 --> 00:57:23.943]  You know, since you called in with your fake Klaus Schwab voice, it's a little bit better than mine.
[00:57:23.963 --> 00:57:24.883]  I can't do him very well.
[00:57:25.383 --> 00:57:29.125]  I can do kind of an enveloped, ah, yes, but I can't really do Klaus Schwab very well.
[00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:34.068]  We're going to get a few of the music videos of, uh, parroting, parroting, parry.
[00:57:34.888 --> 00:57:36.289]  I like your Chinese dragon.
[00:57:36.769 --> 00:57:37.230]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:39.831]  I like your Chinese dragon voice too.
[00:57:41.311 --> 00:57:45.857]  Well, we need to do a parody of that a little bit more too, but I need to get better with my Klaus Schwab voice.
[00:57:47.332 --> 00:57:51.513]  What are we going to do with these guys, these psychopaths, megalomaniacs?
[00:57:51.553 --> 00:58:02.397]  Well, I mean, we're here opposing them and trying to warn the American people, people of the world, and trying to mobilize against, you know, you'll own nothing, have nothing, and total race war and tyranny, and it's liberal, so let's do it.
[00:58:02.837 --> 00:58:03.698]  Thanks for the call, brother.
[00:58:04.378 --> 00:58:14.441]  Let's go ahead and play a couple of these music videos for some light entertainment, and then I'll go right back to Jay, Joss, Jason, Tommy, Tony, Roman, and others.
[00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:16.702]  But here's a parody of Klaus Schwab.
[00:58:17.566 --> 00:58:18.346]  Scene spec?
[00:58:18.747 --> 00:58:19.207]  All night.
[00:58:19.227 --> 00:58:21.328]  You know nothing.
[00:58:22.008 --> 00:58:23.029]  And be happy.
[00:58:23.529 --> 00:58:27.171]  But this one is gonna make your modified mRNA tingle.
[00:58:27.631 --> 00:58:31.173]  Time Lies presents Greatest Schwabs, Volume 15.
[00:58:32.314 --> 00:58:34.275]  A new world order in music.
[00:58:35.075 --> 00:58:37.278]  One, two, three, four, five.
[00:58:37.478 --> 00:58:39.981]  All the unvaccinated are still alive!
[00:58:40.321 --> 00:58:42.723]  A little bit of Pfizer in my arm.
[00:58:43.064 --> 00:58:45.466]  A little bit of BioNTech does no harm.
[00:58:45.847 --> 00:58:48.069]  A little Johnson & Johnson does the trick.
[00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:51.112]  A little AstraZeneca so you don't get sick.
[00:58:51.553 --> 00:58:53.235]  It's booster number five!
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.461]  Let's talk about Vax, baby.
[00:58:56.821 --> 00:58:58.682]  Let's talk about Doc Ho Chi.
[00:58:59.023 --> 00:59:03.145]  Let's talk about all the weird and countless side effects, maybe.
[00:59:03.505 --> 00:59:05.026]  Let's talk about Vax.
[00:59:05.747 --> 00:59:08.948]  Let's talk about Vax a little, little, little.
[00:59:08.988 --> 00:59:10.569]  Come and take the 7th shot, the 7th shot.
[00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:12.370]  With a little luck you get my, my, my, my, oh!
[00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:25.508]   My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, You won't have to be rich with CBDC.
[00:59:25.768 --> 00:59:29.734]  You'll have all you need with central currency.
[00:59:30.075 --> 00:59:33.841]  We just take your extra belts and your...
[00:59:38.673 --> 00:59:53.582]  And you can walk 500 steps, but not a single step more, until the curfew activates, and robot cops vent at your door.
[00:59:54.683 --> 01:00:00.426]  Just a small town boy drinking, genetically modified soy.
[01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:07.903]  This ensures he doesn't co-create.
[01:00:08.644 --> 01:00:11.606]  Please stop breeding.
[01:00:11.706 --> 01:00:13.107]  Stop the breeding!
[01:00:13.327 --> 01:00:15.869]  We're almost 9 billion people.
[01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:23.896]  Please stop breeding right now!
[01:00:25.537 --> 01:00:27.639]  He didn't start the Pfizer.
[01:00:28.399 --> 01:00:31.682]  We just made you take it, even if you hate it.

[01:00:47.098 --> 01:00:50.060]  And mealworm tastes just like a steak.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.183]  Ain't nothing better than a deep fried butterfly.
[01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.725]  Or centipede protein shake.
[01:01:01.687 --> 01:01:05.850]  Be sure to check the Cricket McNuggets out.
[01:01:06.551 --> 01:01:09.693]  They're almost as crunchy as worms.
[01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:15.718]  And chew your crick as hotbar sandwich extra loud.
[01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:19.161]  Cause this is all you get.
[01:01:20.182 --> 01:01:22.964]  I don't care who you are.
[01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:25.145]  Where you're from.
[01:01:25.546 --> 01:01:27.707]  Don't care what you want.
[01:01:28.068 --> 01:01:31.068]  You will eat a box.
[01:01:31.068 --> 01:01:35.548]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:01:35.548 --> 01:01:39.528]  The Willie has what I need.
[01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:42.507]  I ordered Willie magazine.
[01:01:42.507 --> 01:01:43.188]  All right, folks.
[01:01:43.188 --> 01:01:46.586]  Let's go ahead now and go back to your calls.
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:55.497]  We do have that clip, it's coming up at the start of the next segment, when I was on Steve Bannon this morning, where he had a compilation of them saying it's not just MAGA that are the terrorists now, it's the Christians.
[01:01:57.819 --> 01:02:00.641]  So, this is it, declaring us all the enemy.
[01:02:01.081 --> 01:02:04.584]  And they got all the movies out right now, the white Christians are going to kill everybody.
[01:02:04.924 --> 01:02:05.885]  And they're going to supply it.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.981]  So this is not even hard to figure out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:12.463]  Jay in Seattle, thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:16.525]  Hey, Mr. Jones, I appreciate you taking my call, sir.
[01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:20.247]  Hey, I have a statement and a question, kind of wrapped up in the same.
[01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:33.395]  You know, I notice in different countries, sir, that, you know, in Rome or Italy, people mask to the streets when there's an issue of small things.
[01:02:34.346 --> 01:02:53.898]   Compared to big things and the thing I don't understand is why we don't do that in this country whether you know We have all these people like Antifa and all these other extremists block the traffic and do their whole bullcrap You know, I don't understand what the hell Why we can't just stop one day of work?
[01:02:53.898 --> 01:02:57.898]   But listen, that's what liberals, liberals communists love strikes.
[01:02:57.898 --> 01:03:03.086]   So they're out attacking Christmas trees and knocking them over and blocking highways and shooting people and the
[01:03:03.086 --> 01:03:04.898]  media is oh how liberal and loving.
[01:03:04.898 --> 01:03:08.898]   We hurt them by not shopping with globalists. We hurt them by electing people that stop them.
[01:03:08.898 --> 01:03:11.898]  We hurt them by taking our government back.
[01:03:11.898 --> 01:03:14.898]   There's this idea that the work stoppage will show the globalists.
[01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:19.171]  They shut the world down for a couple years to destroy the economy.
[01:03:19.391 --> 01:03:20.912]  The big banks have unlimited money.
[01:03:21.132 --> 01:03:22.633]  They can handle a six-month strike.
[01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:30.396]  What they can't handle is nobody working for globalists or anybody supporting globalists and people protesting globalists outside their houses peacefully.
[01:03:30.916 --> 01:03:32.637]  So I'm not knocking your idea of strikes.
[01:03:33.296 --> 01:03:34.296]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:34.296 --> 01:03:38.896]   But a strike hurts the mom-and-pop restaurant as much as it, you know, and it doesn't hurt
[01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:41.895]  Starbucks, because they've got unlimited ESG money.
[01:03:41.895 --> 01:03:46.296]   That's why the head of IBM said, "We don't hire white people," in that internal video
[01:03:46.296 --> 01:03:51.416]   that got released, because they were ordered by Larry Fink, who said, "We control you,"
[01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:56.616]   to make sure that white people are shut down, to set the precedent under ESGs that they
[01:03:56.616 --> 01:03:58.096]  can do anything they want.
[01:03:58.096 --> 01:04:00.686]  Because if you'll say, "All white people can't have a job,"
[01:04:00.686 --> 01:04:06.095]   well, you can sure as hell take banking away from Christians or conservatives or anti-globalists.
[01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:11.296]   So they're legitimizing discrimination through AI, through social credit scores, through
[01:04:11.296 --> 01:04:18.536]   central bank digital currencies, and once that gets accepted, they can do anything.
[01:04:18.536 --> 01:04:19.136]  So I mean...
[01:04:19.867 --> 01:04:42.764]   You know, and I'm not on the track of violence and everything else, but it seems like these people that are extreme, like Timothy McVeigh and the other people that have made a name for themselves by taking the violence to the government, I mean, if masking in the streets isn't an alternative, This country was founded on blood.
[01:04:43.325 --> 01:04:45.787]  Why the hell should we not give it back to them?
[01:04:46.107 --> 01:04:47.909]  All right, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.952]  I could talk for 50 hours about what you just said.
[01:04:52.714 --> 01:05:03.866]  There was a thing called chivalry to a certain extent 200 years ago, 250 years ago, where the British troops lined up and we lined up because you're in the military and you're men and you go kill each other and then who wins, wins.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:13.146]  And we actually introduced the guerrilla stuff we learned from the Native Americans and started, you know, don't call it fighting dirty, but, you know, shooting and running and shooting and running.
[01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:16.309]  Like the Russians did when Napoleon went into Russia.
[01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:27.578]  So if somebody truck bombed the UN today, it would take a discredited, hated group in trouble and make them victims and they would probably get their world treaty through.
[01:05:28.607 --> 01:05:31.769]  Oklahoma City was run by the FBI, the CIA, and the ATF.
[01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:32.449]  We know the names.
[01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:33.510]  We know what happened to that.
[01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:41.075]  Bill Clinton on Air Force One after he got re-elected in 1996 said, I owe my re-election in front of a whole press corps.
[01:05:41.095 --> 01:05:41.455]  Look it up.
[01:05:41.815 --> 01:05:43.976]  Bill Clinton said he owed his re-election to Oklahoma City.
[01:05:44.537 --> 01:05:51.561]  They ran that bombing of innocent federal agents by other federal agents and little kids in a nursery.
[01:05:51.621 --> 01:05:56.704]  In fact, they picked that federal building as one of the only ones in the country that had a nursery in it.
[01:05:57.084 --> 01:05:57.905]  Usually it's separate.
[01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:00.892]  By the way, Feds, you shouldn't have a nursery in your own building.
[01:06:00.952 --> 01:06:01.632]  Use your brain.
[01:06:01.652 --> 01:06:02.292]  You're a major target.
[01:06:02.932 --> 01:06:06.894]  So you attack yourself to get the government after the people.
[01:06:07.674 --> 01:06:17.377]  And they're saying right-wingers are about to attack and engage in terror everywhere and that it's imminent so they can come after all of us because we're politically peacefully winning.
[01:06:19.611 --> 01:06:23.292]  So, I mean, I see this where people say, let's get violent.
[01:06:23.392 --> 01:06:27.032]  The tree of liberty must be watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:06:28.033 --> 01:06:29.153]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:06:29.193 --> 01:06:31.993]  got beat up on TV a bunch and had everybody supporting.
[01:06:32.494 --> 01:06:33.414]  Mahatma Gandhi did it.
[01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:34.794]  They said, we're copying Jesus.
[01:06:35.554 --> 01:06:38.775]  Jesus, by what he did, discredited that whole system.
[01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:40.515]  Okay?
[01:06:41.795 --> 01:06:48.005]   So, if you really think, not just You think the globalists care about feds?
[01:06:48.806 --> 01:06:53.711]  So you cook a truck bomb up and roll it into a police station and kill a hundred cops and secretaries.
[01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:55.533]  You just made us all the villains.
[01:06:55.713 --> 01:06:56.334]  So don't worry.
[01:06:56.795 --> 01:06:58.637]  You're not going to have to go out and do it, Caller.
[01:06:59.898 --> 01:07:02.841]  We're in the hour of the globalists are going to do it for you.
[01:07:04.503 --> 01:07:05.844]  So I think you're going to get what you want.
[01:07:06.992 --> 01:07:09.033]  Ambulances and arms and legs blown off.
[01:07:09.913 --> 01:07:16.315]  And you're going to get to hear that the MAGA and power outages and cyber attacks and the Trump people did it.
[01:07:16.975 --> 01:07:21.197]  And then the globalists can turn out and power outages and cut the food off and telling you, oh, it's the fault.
[01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:22.237]  They did this.
[01:07:22.277 --> 01:07:28.839]  They got movies about civil war, where Florida and Texas, everybody rise up and start killing the feds.
[01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:30.540]  And the army comes in and crushes us.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.541]  And of course, they're not going to crush us if that goes to that.
[01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.842]  But that's what they're selling, okay?
[01:07:35.862 --> 01:07:39.223]  Because it's the takedown of the country.
[01:07:41.003 --> 01:07:45.005]  Offensive violence is the very worst thing you can do.
[01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:51.407]  You know, and if you don't get politically engaged now, people that talk about violence as some panacea, you're never going to do it.
[01:07:53.254 --> 01:07:58.817]  How about you go protest in front of UN buildings and educate everybody coming in and out that they're the ones running slave camps all over the world?
[01:07:59.178 --> 01:08:00.879]  How about you go speak at city councils?
[01:08:00.899 --> 01:08:01.839]  That's what the feds are scared of.
[01:08:02.099 --> 01:08:06.182]  It's school boards against critical race theory and pedophilia being taught.
[01:08:06.702 --> 01:08:07.643]  That's what they're scared of.
[01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:08.904]  How about you run for office?
[01:08:08.944 --> 01:08:09.684]  That's what they're scared of.
[01:08:10.645 --> 01:08:13.186]  How about you start a church or go support a church that tells the truth?
[01:08:13.766 --> 01:08:16.168]  How about you go protest in front of an abortion clinic and save some lives?
[01:08:16.708 --> 01:08:20.831]  How about you go to the border and start a channel and just show what's going on?
[01:08:21.815 --> 01:08:23.219]  It's information warfare.
[01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:30.356]   We do not need and we do not want I mean, look, Trump wanted a 10-day investigation in the Senate.
[01:08:30.376 --> 01:08:30.976]  That's the law.
[01:08:31.356 --> 01:08:33.138]  We got a million people there to show our numbers.
[01:08:33.198 --> 01:08:34.319]  The feds provocateured.
[01:08:34.579 --> 01:08:35.519]  They shot of the crowd.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.341]  The provocateurs then got a few people to break through the police.
[01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.683]  They opened the doors and set up a thousand people.
[01:08:41.003 --> 01:08:43.926]  Did going in the Capitol... What if we took the Capitol?
[01:08:43.946 --> 01:08:44.586]  What would that have done?
[01:08:44.806 --> 01:08:45.887]  Capitol doesn't run the government.
[01:08:46.107 --> 01:08:51.491]  They have alternate government facilities at Site R in Maryland and out in Colorado.
[01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:53.693]  Colorado Springs.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:59.844]  They want a fight with us because we're winning the political war of the hearts and minds.
[01:09:00.184 --> 01:09:01.346]  They want a civil war.
[01:09:01.606 --> 01:09:02.807]  That's the whole thing they want.
[01:09:03.007 --> 01:09:11.035]  And I just talked for an hour and 20 minutes before I went to that caller about how horrible the idea of violence is, how it's the worst possible thing.
[01:09:11.455 --> 01:09:12.616]  And I see the comments online.
[01:09:12.797 --> 01:09:14.218]  Why don't you be a man, you wimp?
[01:09:15.059 --> 01:09:15.519]  Why don't you?
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:21.180]  Like Antifa.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.942]  Let's just go shoot a cop in the back of the head.
[01:09:22.962 --> 01:09:23.863]  That'll really stop people.
[01:09:24.263 --> 01:09:26.605]  The feds are cutting off the police to create crime.
[01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:31.710]  Let's say you find out where the FBI is having some birthday party.
[01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.092]  You go shoot 20 FBI agents.
[01:09:33.272 --> 01:09:34.413]  What the hell does that do?
[01:09:34.533 --> 01:09:34.934]  Nothing!
[01:09:35.815 --> 01:09:37.897]  Probably 60% of them are on our side.
[01:09:38.157 --> 01:09:38.958]  It's stupid!
[01:09:41.257 --> 01:09:50.887]  They had to try to get a bunch of poor people, homeless people, to go kidnap Whitmer and give him tens of thousands of dollars apiece, and they never even agreed to do it, and then it came out in court, they were set up!
[01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.570]  That's how Whitmer tried to make herself a hero!
[01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:57.753]  The same FBI team that did that ran January 6th!
[01:09:58.955 --> 01:10:01.878]  The worst idea ever is offensive violence.
[01:10:03.677 --> 01:10:06.383]  But I'll tell you when violence is... You so into it!
[01:10:06.944 --> 01:10:09.170]  How about I tell you the real rules of engagement when we come back?
[01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.274]  I'll tell you when you can get violent, big man!
[01:10:15.106 --> 01:10:16.087]  And be happy.
[01:10:16.788 --> 01:10:22.113]  Comes a brand new collection of hit songs from our beloved Supreme Leader.
[01:10:22.153 --> 01:10:24.375]  Timelize presents The Great Here Set!
[01:10:24.676 --> 01:10:25.697]  Volume 14!

[01:10:33.224 --> 01:10:34.506]  Maxine spec?
[01:10:34.866 --> 01:10:35.366]  All right!
[01:10:38.263 --> 01:10:40.386]  One, two, three and to the four.
[01:10:40.706 --> 01:10:42.869]  Klaus Schwabisch, Schwab and Bill Gates is at the door.
[01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:45.352]  Ready to put a patent on air and glass.
[01:10:45.552 --> 01:10:47.314]  Cause we about to greatly set your ass.
[01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:50.318]  It's like this and like that and like this and that.
[01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.721]  So just chill till the next pandemic.
[01:10:56.775 --> 01:11:05.883]  Digital identity, you shall have until 2030.
[01:11:07.144 --> 01:11:13.108]  No discussion, for it is mandatory.
[01:11:13.549 --> 01:11:16.491]  You will see.
[01:11:16.511 --> 01:11:17.532]  Fifteen minute city.
[01:11:17.552 --> 01:11:22.036]  Fifteen minute city, stay close to home.
[01:11:21.996 --> 01:11:33.036]   to home. 15 minute city. 15 minute city or we'll send a drone. You better comply.
[01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:34.714]  You better watch out.
[01:11:35.075 --> 01:11:38.176]  You better implant that microchip now.
[01:11:38.716 --> 01:11:42.958]  Fanta Claus is running the town.
[01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.339]  Every meal you make.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.241]  Every bite you take.
[01:11:52.194 --> 01:11:58.476]  Every single lunch, with a crispy crunch, you will eat that box.
[01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:01.157]  The Great Here Set, Volume 14.
[01:12:02.037 --> 01:12:02.677]  Get yours now.
[01:12:03.056 --> 01:12:05.056]  available on Shodify and Pfizer.
[01:12:05.056 --> 01:12:08.657]   Alright, that caller doing the Klaus Schwab imitation triggered me to do that.
[01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:13.056]  Look, I'm not trying to rant at the last caller, but...
[01:12:13.056 --> 01:12:20.056]   The globalists are an illegitimate government, literally waging war with us.
[01:12:20.279 --> 01:12:21.939]  They've purged the military of patriots.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.141]  They're trying to start a physical civil war and saying we're going to get violent.
[01:12:26.882 --> 01:12:32.004]  And if you study history, they staged Oklahoma City, the Whitmer kidnapping, the list goes on and on.
[01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:34.965]  So, no.
[01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:43.189]  That's why when a transgender person goes and kills a bunch of little kids, they cover up the dossier, the manifesto, saying I'm going to kill a bunch of white kids.
[01:12:44.465 --> 01:12:46.966]  Because they wanted to blame it on conservatives.
[01:12:47.386 --> 01:12:48.526]  Because it's not good.
[01:12:51.227 --> 01:12:51.747]  Now listen.
[01:12:53.067 --> 01:13:16.605]   If hypothetically, some FBI agent, for no reason, executed, say, my six-year-old daughter, if the FBI raided my house, it's hypothetical, it's not happening, and said, you're gonna pay Jones, and my six-year-old hypothetically is there, and they shoot her in the head and kill her, if that FBI agent does not go to prison, I'm not going to sit here and say what I'm going to do, but it's legitimate that I do something.
[01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:17.807]  That's not happening, okay?
[01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:27.197]  They're all a bunch of former military people slash lawyers who are just told and given BS warrants to go out and do all this crap.
[01:13:28.527 --> 01:13:32.350]  And you look at most of them delivering warrants to Patriots' houses, they look completely ashamed.
[01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:42.317]  They know, folks, the system can't do this evil because it delegitimizes them unless we're dumb enough to start randomly going around and killing Feds.
[01:13:43.157 --> 01:13:46.960]  And I'm not lionizing Feds, and I'm not their guardian, and I'm not sycophantly kissing their ass.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.641]  It's the worst thing.
[01:13:50.002 --> 01:13:54.786]  Plus, randomly killing Feds, or you say, have a war, what's the target?
[01:13:57.888 --> 01:14:03.032]  If somebody went to Bill Gates' house and killed him, they'd turn the son of a bitch into a martyr.
[01:14:03.753 --> 01:14:06.715]  I want to keep exposing him, his lies, his history.
[01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:12.900]  I want to destroy him so he's a archetype we then use to discredit their whole agenda.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.202]  He's worth a lot more to us alive than dead.
[01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:18.604]  His wife's already left him.
[01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:19.945]  Everybody knows he's a pedophile.
[01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:24.128]  The son of a bitch is trying to destroy my life, but I don't want him to die.
[01:14:25.029 --> 01:14:26.210]  I don't want Klaus Schwab to die.
[01:14:27.762 --> 01:14:31.363]  I'm not going to cry when they die like Charlie Munger or Henry Kissinger, but that's good.
[01:14:31.403 --> 01:14:32.384]  Good natural death.
[01:14:32.444 --> 01:14:33.744]  You're going, you've gone to hell now.
[01:14:34.044 --> 01:14:37.245]  You're getting your just reward, but we don't turn them into martyrs.
[01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:39.366]  People always ask me, why are you still alive?
[01:14:39.386 --> 01:14:43.788]  You're not controlled by them because they're not stupid and they don't want to turn me into a martyr.
[01:14:45.548 --> 01:15:01.839]   But I don't want to kill police officers or federal judges or FBI agents, not just because I don't want to turn them into martyrs, but because a lot of them are on our side and It's retarded.
[01:15:02.219 --> 01:15:03.940]  It is stupid.
[01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:06.683]  The Border Patrol is facilitating open borders now.
[01:15:06.923 --> 01:15:07.724]  They can't stand it.
[01:15:07.984 --> 01:15:08.985]  Their unions speak out.
[01:15:09.025 --> 01:15:09.806]  Their head speaks out.
[01:15:09.846 --> 01:15:10.987]  They replace the head all the time.
[01:15:11.267 --> 01:15:12.248]  I mean, they're pissed.
[01:15:13.128 --> 01:15:16.271]  But you signed for that job and now you're there, told to just help everybody come in.
[01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:16.772]  What do you do?
[01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:22.303]  I agree they ought to just stand down so it's so lawless that it finally gets shut down.
[01:15:22.703 --> 01:15:23.803]  But whatever.
[01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:30.426]  You try the moral courage and you got a job and investment in college and everything and you're there getting these orders and then they just resign and they leave.
[01:15:32.547 --> 01:15:35.108]  So these agencies are made up of people just like us.
[01:15:35.628 --> 01:15:36.728]  They're not running things.
[01:15:36.808 --> 01:15:41.990]  It's the big banks and BlackRock that control the Congress and blackmail the Congress.
[01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.891]  Half of Congress went to Epstein's Island.
[01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:44.631]  I mean seriously.
[01:15:44.992 --> 01:15:45.652]  Or stuff like that.
[01:15:47.061 --> 01:15:47.841]  They're the problem.
[01:15:48.301 --> 01:15:52.923]  And look, the left went to the baseball game and tried to kill the conservative caucus because he was sent there to do it.
[01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:55.143]  And CNN said the guy was basically a hero.
[01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:57.504]  Shot Scalise.
[01:15:57.544 --> 01:15:59.765]  Thank God there were good feds there with guns that stopped him.
[01:16:01.085 --> 01:16:03.926]  So, here's an example.
[01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:17.178]   I went to a federal courthouse a few weeks ago, my bankruptcy deal, and I'm not going to make a big deal about it and get people in trouble, but I walk in, and the feds and the marshals there You know, wanted to shake my hand.
[01:16:17.218 --> 01:16:20.179]  They were all, good job, good job, keep it up, you know, we're trying here.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.980]  What, will you just pull up there and bomb the federal courthouse?
[01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:25.121]  What's that going to do?
[01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:31.743]  You just blow up a bunch of, like a secretary that works there, or a janitor, and some federal, what does that do?
[01:16:31.843 --> 01:16:33.123]  It does nothing.
[01:16:33.483 --> 01:16:35.424]  We don't bomb federal buildings.
[01:16:36.264 --> 01:16:37.265]  We're the good guys.
[01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:44.327]  But I'm telling you, the bombing of federal buildings are coming, and it's going to be blamed on us, and it's already started.
[01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:45.367]  Okay, so...
[01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:53.367]   I always get these calls. I get them every once in a while, and it's always the same way.
[01:16:53.367 --> 01:16:56.367]   Like it's something like, "Oh, maybe we should just get violent."
[01:16:56.367 --> 01:16:57.206]  Violent.
[01:16:57.206 --> 01:17:05.289]   *sniff* You know, if somebody went to New York, to the big compound, George Soros' house, that guy's already dead, basically.
[01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:13.753]  And if you climbed the wall and went in there and hung him, that would turn that Nazi collaborator into a victim.
[01:17:13.873 --> 01:17:15.454]  I don't want him to be killed.
[01:17:17.406 --> 01:17:25.670]  I don't want any of them to be killed, but since you asked the question, I'll go back to your calls, and I'll play this clip first, and we're gonna skip this break coming up, but since the caller, what was his name?
[01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:26.550]  I forget, he hung up.
[01:17:29.231 --> 01:17:35.894]  Since you love to talk about violence so much, you think it's so cool, let me tell you something, violence is easier than taking a piss.
[01:17:39.015 --> 01:17:39.655]  Jay in Seattle.
[01:17:41.836 --> 01:17:45.238]  Most people have a governor, and they decide in a fight not to hurt somebody.
[01:17:46.303 --> 01:17:51.205]  If you tell your mind, I'm going to hurt somebody, even a little guy, you can kill somebody just like that.
[01:17:51.225 --> 01:17:53.827]  Okay?
[01:17:53.867 --> 01:17:54.927]  You're designed to kill.
[01:17:55.307 --> 01:17:56.028]  It's easy.
[01:17:57.188 --> 01:17:57.449]  All right?
[01:17:58.569 --> 01:17:59.129]  Very easy.
[01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.151]  Just jump on top of somebody with your knees and your arms.
[01:18:02.731 --> 01:18:03.652]  They're not going to be expecting it.
[01:18:03.832 --> 01:18:08.954]  Grab them by the head, headbutt them, and then slam their head in the ground, and then just do it ten more times.
[01:18:09.314 --> 01:18:10.095]  It's easier than that.
[01:18:11.836 --> 01:18:12.516]  It's very easy.
[01:18:13.965 --> 01:18:16.346]  All you do is, with all your will, say, die.
[01:18:16.366 --> 01:18:17.347]  That's what the military says.
[01:18:17.407 --> 01:18:18.207]  Die, motherfucker.
[01:18:19.948 --> 01:18:22.049]  It's the will of the word when you say it.
[01:18:22.069 --> 01:18:23.709]  It makes your brain aim.
[01:18:23.729 --> 01:18:25.150]  Your brain wants the order to do it.
[01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:27.251]  So you say, die!
[01:18:27.271 --> 01:18:36.435]  And you chop them right in the larynx, right in the voice box, right in their esophagus, right in their windpipe.
[01:18:37.095 --> 01:18:37.656]  Die!
[01:18:38.829 --> 01:18:44.431]  And they're gonna wish they're dead and most of the time they're gonna end up with a trach in their throat in the ambulance.
[01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.291]  But what does that do?
[01:18:47.112 --> 01:18:49.532]  That's like sitting on a toilet and saying, alright, take a dump.
[01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:56.233]   It's infinitely harder to do this non-violently, but infinitely more successful.
[01:18:56.233 --> 01:19:08.072]  I've sat there before when somebody's whooping my ass.
[01:19:08.251 --> 01:19:09.472]  And I just learned this as a young man.
[01:19:09.492 --> 01:19:12.094]  When I just say, die.
[01:19:12.974 --> 01:19:15.656]  And they had got there real quick or pretty close to it.
[01:19:15.936 --> 01:19:16.257]  Die!
[01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:17.277]  In the nose.
[01:19:17.518 --> 01:19:18.398]  It's going off the face.
[01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:18.718]  Gone.
[01:19:19.499 --> 01:19:20.660]  Black hole, blood shooting out.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:21.360]  No nose.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.922]  I've torn three noses completely off people's faces.
[01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:24.803]  Die!
[01:19:25.603 --> 01:19:28.425]  I've had nose bones stick in my hand because I said, die!
[01:19:28.445 --> 01:19:30.467]  And nobody taught me that.
[01:19:32.088 --> 01:19:32.808]  It's instinctive.
[01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.431]  Die, motherfucker!
[01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:37.291]  Die, motherfucker!
[01:19:37.332 --> 01:19:37.652]  Die!
[01:19:39.909 --> 01:19:49.036]  Now, how about live, live, live, live, save the country, save the world, save the babies, love God, God help me.
[01:19:49.237 --> 01:19:52.139]  That's better than saying die, die, die, die, die.
[01:19:52.339 --> 01:19:53.400]  The globalists know how to do it too.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.161]  They think it's fun.
[01:19:54.381 --> 01:19:56.823]  That's all they want is death, death, death, death.
[01:19:56.783 --> 01:19:59.343]  How about life, life, life, life?
[01:19:59.343 --> 01:20:10.863]  Alright, I'm done talking about it.
[01:20:10.863 --> 01:20:12.863]  (sighs)
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.442]  But you asked, you know, you love violence so much, so here's the deal.
[01:20:15.883 --> 01:20:17.244]  I meant to tell the crew and I forgot to do it.
[01:20:17.264 --> 01:20:20.626]  Well, who was that guy we had on from Canada six, eight months ago?
[01:20:20.646 --> 01:20:29.573]  He did the little short video that was so powerful, where it shows a permanent lockdown with drones, and they have you locked up, they make you opt in, and then you die when you take the shot, but it's all compartmentalized.
[01:20:32.155 --> 01:20:41.877]   If they release the new violence, if they try lockdowns, if they try to break families up, if they try to take you away to these centers, It'll be 50 times worse than last time.
[01:20:45.178 --> 01:20:46.799]  Then, you're not assaulting anybody.
[01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:49.079]  They're coming to get you in a van.
[01:20:49.179 --> 01:20:50.460]  They're coming to take you away.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.822]  And if upfront people do not comply, they will stop very quickly, as Alexander Solzhenitsyn said.
[01:20:57.303 --> 01:21:00.544]  Pull me, oh how we burn in the camps, text of Solzhenitsyn.
[01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:02.025]  They're in St.
[01:21:02.065 --> 01:21:02.606]  Petersburg.
[01:21:02.626 --> 01:21:04.086]  They've arrested a quarter of the population.
[01:21:04.106 --> 01:21:05.387]  They're killing 10% of them.
[01:21:05.607 --> 01:21:07.628]  They're taking the rest of the slave labor camps for a decade.
[01:21:08.328 --> 01:21:11.889]  And Schultz and Eaton said if we would have just... They had no guns in Russia.
[01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:19.413]  If they would have just waited with hatchets and clubs, when they came, there'd be no enforcers to carry it out.
[01:21:21.073 --> 01:21:22.714]  So let's not get to that point.
[01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:32.487]   Let's stop it now, peacefully, before we get to the point And then obviously, if there's a civil war, you don't wait till the armored vehicle comes to your house.
[01:21:34.068 --> 01:21:45.617]  You find out where they are, where their base is, what restaurant they go to, you just have your job as a livery guy, all the stuff you do, you watch him, you do it, you don't tell anybody.
[01:21:46.878 --> 01:21:49.360]  And then, okay, yeah, then you've got to cut off the organ.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:55.565]  You've got to cut off the arm of the Satan that's coming to grab men, women, and children and take them to a death camp.
[01:21:56.717 --> 01:21:59.480]  And then you'll get all the blood and all the gore you want, okay?
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.860]  Let's not do that ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:09.699]   I mean let's say you work in a drone factory during this takeover.
[01:22:10.448 --> 01:22:12.170]  You're there overseeing the robots, the computers.
[01:22:13.511 --> 01:22:15.112]  And they got 50 million people in the U.S.
[01:22:15.152 --> 01:22:15.933]  alone in death camps.
[01:22:15.953 --> 01:22:16.814]  You know it's all going down.
[01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:18.015]  You don't want to live through it anymore.
[01:22:18.595 --> 01:22:21.157]  Well, you just firebomb the whole facility.
[01:22:21.938 --> 01:22:23.159]  You take out the drone factory.
[01:22:24.804 --> 01:22:26.465]  The most important thing is not killing people.
[01:22:26.545 --> 01:22:28.025]  It's going to take their infrastructure out.
[01:22:28.805 --> 01:22:33.387]  Notice they've been taking our infrastructure out, our pipelines, our production, our food.
[01:22:33.427 --> 01:22:33.987]  They're smart.
[01:22:34.207 --> 01:22:37.869]  They don't need to kill us physically up front.
[01:22:37.929 --> 01:22:39.969]  They kill us by cutting the oxygen off.
[01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:44.131]  Yeah, it's beyond the reset is the name of the video.
[01:22:46.952 --> 01:22:47.992]  And I'm not calling for that.
[01:22:48.052 --> 01:22:49.433]  That's a hypothetical for you.
[01:22:51.602 --> 01:22:55.065]  Or, there's no police, things have been broken down for three months, everybody's starving to death?
[01:22:58.368 --> 01:23:01.631]  A big horde of warlord comes down your road?
[01:23:01.931 --> 01:23:06.114]  You better have your community backed up, ready, prepared to defend yourself.
[01:23:06.435 --> 01:23:10.998]  Even a few dozen families can hold off the so-called warlord, but nobody's going to be standing against them.
[01:23:11.018 --> 01:23:11.759]  They're going to be just falling.
[01:23:11.939 --> 01:23:13.200]  And that's in one scenario.
[01:23:14.061 --> 01:23:16.323]  The globalists, I don't think they're going to let it get this out of control.
[01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:19.163]  They're gonna threaten it and bring us right to the edge.
[01:23:19.163 --> 01:23:27.163]  But you do need to learn the power of words.
[01:23:27.163 --> 01:23:37.163]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:23:28.661 --> 01:23:31.363]  And because it's not like a words magic and you say it, it happens.
[01:23:31.222 --> 01:23:34.222]  No, the word orders your brain into action.
[01:23:34.222 --> 01:23:43.222]  And we archetypally think of this as manly to kill.
[01:23:43.933 --> 01:23:45.954]  This is a more sophisticated battle we're in right now.
[01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.117]  I would focus 9% on life and 10% on death.
[01:23:51.859 --> 01:23:53.440]  Life's what's powerful, not death.
[01:23:56.621 --> 01:23:57.581]  Alright, here's the clip.
[01:23:57.601 --> 01:23:58.661]  I said that I won't go to your calls.
[01:23:58.681 --> 01:24:00.302]  This is, uh, Steve Bannon played this.
[01:24:00.322 --> 01:24:01.142]  I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[01:24:01.162 --> 01:24:04.923]  It's like six minutes long, but TV shows, programs demonizing Christians.
[01:24:05.383 --> 01:24:06.423]  They're now the terrorists.
[01:24:06.483 --> 01:24:07.724]  They're, oh, the nationalists.
[01:24:07.744 --> 01:24:08.624]  Oh, they're dangerous.
[01:24:08.904 --> 01:24:11.404]  They mean well, but oh, it's not just Trump supporters now.
[01:24:11.424 --> 01:24:12.205]  Now it's the Christians.
[01:24:12.245 --> 01:24:14.745]  They're the enemy and all the movies are coming around now.
[01:24:14.785 --> 01:24:16.025]  They're really trying to brand this.
[01:24:16.325 --> 01:24:22.227]  So the last thing we want is to be violent when they're the ones that just burned down half the country a few years ago.
[01:24:22.247 --> 01:24:22.647]  Here's the clip.
[01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:28.312]  Mike Johnson, he's from your home state of Louisiana, the Speaker of the House.
[01:24:28.472 --> 01:24:34.816]  I read today he wrote a forward in a book that describes two conspiracy theories and homophobic insults.
[01:24:35.416 --> 01:24:37.957]  I thought, Mike Johnson wrote the forward to the Bible?
[01:24:41.739 --> 01:24:45.942]  Do you think Mike Johnson can hold his party together now that he has taken the mantle?
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.823]  Well, first of all, I don't think he can hold his party together.
[01:24:49.883 --> 01:24:51.504]  Second of all, you're exactly right.
[01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:57.990]  Mike Johnson and what he believes is one of the greatest threats we have to date to the United States.
[01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.731]  I promise you, I know these people.
[01:25:01.172 --> 01:25:05.116]  You're talking about Christian nationalism.
[01:25:05.196 --> 01:25:05.736]  Absolutely.
[01:25:05.776 --> 01:25:07.037]  This is a bigger threat than Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:10.216 --> 01:25:11.216]  to this country.
[01:25:11.216 --> 01:25:16.095]   They, and let me tell you something, they have a Speaker of the House, they got probably
[01:25:16.095 --> 01:25:20.975]  at least two Supreme Court Justices, maybe more.
[01:25:20.975 --> 01:25:27.536]   Don't kid yourself, people in the press have no idea who this guy is, how he was formed,
[01:25:27.536 --> 01:25:33.655]   what the threat is, and this is a fundamental threat to the United States.
[01:25:33.861 --> 01:25:35.242]  And George Washington also said it.
[01:25:35.061 --> 01:25:38.061]  in a constitution, they'll tell you that.
[01:25:38.061 --> 01:25:43.061]   Mike Johnson himself says what is democracy but two wolves and a lamb having lunch.
[01:25:43.061 --> 01:25:44.061]  Kid paws.
[01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:45.061]  That's what.
[01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:48.661]   That's a Thomas Jefferson quote and George Washington also said it.
[01:25:48.661 --> 01:25:53.181]   Pure democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner.
[01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:55.461]  They don't believe in democracy.
[01:25:55.450 --> 01:26:03.735]  A pure democracy in ancient Greece, they only had it a few places, if 51% voted to throw someone off a cliff for what they said, they murdered you.
[01:26:05.436 --> 01:26:12.601]  In a republic, the minority's rights are protected, we have a code of our basic rights, and then we vote on big new general issues.
[01:26:13.755 --> 01:26:20.056]  So, oh, Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, he wants a tyranny because he quotes Thomas Jefferson.
[01:26:20.196 --> 01:26:24.457]  Shut up, Carvel, in your pink Marine Corps outfit, you damn Nosferatu.
[01:26:24.537 --> 01:26:24.977]  Continue.
[01:26:25.418 --> 01:26:26.898]  They really, really, really believe.
[01:26:27.078 --> 01:26:29.798]  And to say, oh, come on, man, that's just some crazy.
[01:26:30.139 --> 01:26:30.659]  No, no.
[01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:35.180]  They believe that and they're coming and they've been doing it forever.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:36.320]  They're funded.
[01:26:37.503 --> 01:26:44.126]  They're funded, they're relentless, and you know, they probably won't win for a while, but they might.
[01:26:44.226 --> 01:26:47.585]  And if they do, the whole country blows again.
[01:26:47.585 --> 01:26:51.386]   I think what you're sort of getting at here is Christian nationalism.
[01:26:51.386 --> 01:26:55.626]   I haven't read the book yet, but I read the piece that you put out in The Atlantic about
[01:26:55.626 --> 01:27:01.006]   it that ended with the pastor who took over for your father, who was trying to fight the
[01:27:01.006 --> 01:27:03.945]  takeover of Trump in the church.
[01:27:03.945 --> 01:27:07.866]   You asked him what's happened to the evangelicals in America, and he said they love America
[01:27:07.866 --> 01:27:08.866]  too much.
[01:27:09.422 --> 01:27:10.783]  Is that what we're dealing with here?
[01:27:10.943 --> 01:27:17.368]  Is this what the evangelicals, or at least for some evangelicals that are supporting Trump, morphed into Christian nationalism?
[01:27:17.808 --> 01:27:18.388]  I think so.
[01:27:18.408 --> 01:27:23.349]  And listen, Christian nationalism is a loaded term and it means different things to different people.
[01:27:23.469 --> 01:27:27.931]  So I think clarifying in this context what the definition is is helpful.
[01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:34.092]  At the end of the day, if you are a follower of Jesus Christ, you are called to a citizenship in heaven.
[01:27:34.812 --> 01:27:37.693]  And you are called to be a part of the kingdom of God.
[01:27:37.833 --> 01:27:44.515]  And we are warned as Christians throughout scripture, Old Testament and New Testament, prayers and epistles, all the way through.
[01:27:44.835 --> 01:27:45.755]  It's not ambiguous.
[01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:51.719]  That your identity is rooted in heaven, your identity is rooted in following Jesus.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:28:12.314]  Unfortunately, I think this love of country, which can be healthy to a point, over-realized among some of these evangelical Christians, has sort of merged two kingdoms into one, and has created this belief that somehow, if America falls, then God himself is defeated.
[01:28:12.614 --> 01:28:17.338]  When, again, as Christians, we believe that Jesus triumphed over the grave, so there is no such thing as defeat.
[01:28:17.738 --> 01:28:33.711]  But when you begin to think of America as almost this covenant nation, that God has ordained us, God has blessed us, and you are fighting for God by fighting for America, that is Christian nationalism, and that is what has infected much of the church today.
[01:28:34.251 --> 01:28:37.174]  Because that's how the country was founded, it's called Manifest Destiny, you know that.
[01:28:37.194 --> 01:28:44.355]   Let me tell you, Atlantic is the mouthpiece, more than even the Financial Times of London or the New York Times.
[01:28:44.475 --> 01:28:46.516]  It is the talking point they all copy.
[01:28:46.957 --> 01:28:47.997]  Now who owns the Atlantic?
[01:28:49.878 --> 01:28:55.162]  The widow of Steve Jobs, who went to Little St.
[01:28:55.222 --> 01:28:59.844]  John's Pedophile Island over a hundred times, put her up on screen with Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:28:59.884 --> 01:29:00.585]  That's at Little St.
[01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:00.865]  John's.
[01:29:00.905 --> 01:29:03.307]  There she is, the blonde, there in the middle.
[01:29:05.368 --> 01:29:11.375]   And it totally weaponizes the mouth of the CIA It's who they are.
[01:29:12.476 --> 01:29:14.037]  It's their operation.
[01:29:16.478 --> 01:29:18.398]  And they're now saying the Christians are the terrorists.
[01:29:19.799 --> 01:29:20.760]  The Christians are the enemy.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.842]  They got the nerve to call us a threat.
[01:29:29.523 --> 01:29:30.364]  That's who these people are.
[01:29:32.305 --> 01:29:35.506]  So just remember, everything coming out of their mouth is Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:29:35.806 --> 01:29:37.447]  That's Jeffrey Epstein operation.
[01:29:38.886 --> 01:29:39.426]  Right there.
[01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:42.229]  New World Order operation telling you what they're going to do to you.
[01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:45.231]  And their desire to come after all of us.
[01:29:47.152 --> 01:29:47.452]  All right.
[01:29:47.472 --> 01:29:49.834]  I want to go back to your calls.
[01:29:49.854 --> 01:29:50.595]  I want to move quicker.
[01:29:50.615 --> 01:29:52.096]  Stu Peters is coming up in studio.
[01:29:52.216 --> 01:29:53.096]  Come in at six after.
[01:29:53.116 --> 01:29:55.738]  Probably go a little bit in the fourth hour.
[01:29:55.758 --> 01:30:00.802]  He's interviewing me for his show, but let's go and go to Jason in Tennessee.
[01:30:00.842 --> 01:30:01.463]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:30:01.503 --> 01:30:01.763]  Go ahead.
[01:30:03.724 --> 01:30:04.104]  Hi, Steven.
[01:30:04.145 --> 01:30:05.285]  Greetings to you, Alex.
[01:30:05.846 --> 01:30:06.126]  Welcome.
[01:30:07.552 --> 01:30:08.332]  Hi, uh, yes.
[01:30:08.613 --> 01:30:12.134]  I've actually, I've got the Survival Shield X3 in my hand right now.
[01:30:12.214 --> 01:30:14.735]  I've got a couple bottles of X2 in reserve.
[01:30:15.496 --> 01:30:17.457]  Um, and I love your products.
[01:30:17.497 --> 01:30:22.279]  I've got all of the Emmerich's essential oils, the Ultra Blue, the Infinite Focus.
[01:30:22.619 --> 01:30:25.080]  Well, the only reason we stayed on air was your support, brother.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:25.641]  So thank you.
[01:30:26.781 --> 01:30:27.281]  Thank you.
[01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:32.644]  And, uh, season's greetings and blessings to you, your crew, and the rest of Team Humanity out there.
[01:30:34.543 --> 01:30:36.664]  I wanted to call in and talk real quick.
[01:30:36.824 --> 01:30:42.186]  Three things that I think synergistically have really focused my life and could help everyone.
[01:30:43.427 --> 01:30:44.967]  One, of course, the nutraceuticals.
[01:30:45.088 --> 01:30:46.388]  I couldn't do without it.
[01:30:47.288 --> 01:30:50.370]  I've got a new job starting Monday and I can't wait to buy some more.
[01:30:51.670 --> 01:31:00.144]   The next thing, I don't know if you've I've had Wim Hof on your show, but I've been doing the breathing method alone that's really helped my life.
[01:31:00.965 --> 01:31:05.708]  Joe Rogan's had him on his show, and I really feel like it could impact what saves my life.
[01:31:05.748 --> 01:31:06.449]  What's his name again?
[01:31:06.489 --> 01:31:07.910]  I know breathing's key, obviously.
[01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:08.670]  What's his name?
[01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:09.591]  Wim Hof.
[01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:11.072]  W-I-M-H-O-F.
[01:31:11.212 --> 01:31:12.153]  All right, Wim Hof.
[01:31:12.253 --> 01:31:13.134]  I'll have him on, brother.
[01:31:13.174 --> 01:31:14.915]  We're talking about the Civil War and the New World Order.
[01:31:14.935 --> 01:31:15.635]  I appreciate your call.
[01:31:16.296 --> 01:31:17.917]  Let's go to Tony in South Carolina.
[01:31:17.937 --> 01:31:18.397]  You're on the air.
[01:31:18.417 --> 01:31:18.698]  Go ahead.
[01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:20.882]  Yeah, how are you doing Alex?
[01:31:20.962 --> 01:31:22.564]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[01:31:22.985 --> 01:31:32.575]  Was interested in, you had a nice interview with Tucker Carlson the other night and he had mentioned about, you know, people going to the border and stopping this kind of on their own.
[01:31:32.595 --> 01:31:34.598]  Now I don't call for violence in any way, shape, or form.
[01:31:35.978 --> 01:31:45.380]  You can stop it by showing little kids as young as one put in vans with random people, then follow them all the way to Ohio or wherever they're going.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:50.041]  If you just stake people out and follow these white vans, there's hundreds a day per town.
[01:31:50.941 --> 01:31:51.561]  You can't miss it.
[01:31:51.581 --> 01:31:52.521]  It's not like you're hunting for it.
[01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:57.542]  You pull up, there's white vans, pot-bellied pedophiles, little babies being loaded, little girls crying.
[01:31:57.762 --> 01:31:58.642]  They're shoved in.
[01:31:58.982 --> 01:32:01.463]  You just follow them, have the money for a few weeks.
[01:32:02.063 --> 01:32:02.964]  Stay on their ass.
[01:32:03.424 --> 01:32:04.785]  Go to the location they're at.
[01:32:04.825 --> 01:32:05.466]  Stake them out.
[01:32:05.746 --> 01:32:06.446]  Shoot a video.
[01:32:06.486 --> 01:32:06.907]  Put it up.
[01:32:07.227 --> 01:32:08.548]  That'll burn their ass down.
[01:32:09.896 --> 01:32:14.837]  Well, what about, like, say, 50 people shut down a highway in California yesterday and made a big mess.
[01:32:14.877 --> 01:32:21.539]  What about a few thousand people just going and sitting in front of the fence and doing the same kind of thing and then keeping... No, I think that's a good non-violent thing.
[01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:27.960]  If you're not blocking regular people not committing a crime going to work or ambulances, you're at the border where the Border Patrol won't do its job.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.700]  Yeah, we should pick a town, pick a place.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.421]  The problem is they'll just move the illegals to another place.
[01:32:31.861 --> 01:32:36.822]  And then we should go and peacefully sit on the highway, but then they'll probably charge us as terrorists and...
[01:32:37.242 --> 01:32:37.883]  You know, everything else.
[01:32:37.903 --> 01:32:40.125]  But yeah, no, that's the type of civil disobedience we need.
[01:32:40.545 --> 01:32:46.190]  Long before we get to violence, we should extinguish every civil disobedience operation we've got.
[01:32:46.791 --> 01:32:50.654]  And if we had the churches in America doing their job, they'd all be going to the border to stop this.
[01:32:50.674 --> 01:32:51.735]  This is human trafficking.
[01:32:51.976 --> 01:32:54.478]  They're putting them into sex slavery and slave labor.
[01:32:54.738 --> 01:32:55.879]  It's even the New York Times.
[01:32:56.199 --> 01:32:57.641]  Where are the megachurches?
[01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:01.298]  It kills me to see the Border Patrol standing on one side.
[01:33:01.318 --> 01:33:08.484]  I know they're trying to do their job, and they're not really being allowed to do their job, but to stand and watch, they're armed in all their gear, watching people walk through a fence.
[01:33:08.544 --> 01:33:09.124]  What's wrong with you?
[01:33:09.144 --> 01:33:09.384]  No, no, no.
[01:33:09.424 --> 01:33:13.448]  They've got bulldozers ramming the fences over, but Texas put up, it's worse than that.
[01:33:14.348 --> 01:33:15.249]  Yeah, it's a mess.
[01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:15.890]  It's a mess.
[01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:16.570]  Thank you very much.
[01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:19.232]  Long time listener, and the show is awesome.
[01:33:19.713 --> 01:33:21.254]  X3, X2, good stuff.
[01:33:21.614 --> 01:33:22.135]  Have a great day.
[01:33:22.595 --> 01:33:22.935]  Thank you.
[01:33:22.955 --> 01:33:24.437]  Yeah, we have StorWide for shipping right now.
[01:33:25.373 --> 01:33:26.834]  We have double Patriot points.

[01:33:30.735 --> 01:33:36.137]  Men, women, children, particularly people with dark skin, you don't absorb as much vitamin D3 in the winter.
[01:33:36.217 --> 01:33:37.077]  You need this product.
[01:33:38.217 --> 01:33:39.178]  It's 40% off.
[01:33:39.278 --> 01:33:40.178]  Five-star reviews.

[01:33:42.279 --> 01:33:43.599]  While you're at it, get TurboForce.
[01:33:46.274 --> 01:33:48.135]  Ten Hour Clean Energy, X2 is selling out.
[01:33:48.815 --> 01:33:53.878]  I get a book and a film and I keep forgetting, because I told them wrong, and the teaser is being printed right now.
[01:33:54.278 --> 01:33:57.300]  It's not Team Human, it's Team Humanity, me and Elon Musk talked about.
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:02.002]  The shirts will be ready in about a week, but because of Christmas you won't get it until the New Year.
[01:34:02.282 --> 01:34:03.403]  It's a fundraiser.

[01:34:06.304 --> 01:34:07.345]  It says Team Humanity.

[01:34:11.507 --> 01:34:12.948]  Then we have this design, Team Humanity.
[01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:14.929]  It's an image of the nuclear family.
[01:34:15.729 --> 01:34:18.710]  And it's a great way to start conversations.
[01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:19.651]  Watch Team Humanity.
[01:34:19.911 --> 01:34:24.053]  We talk about football teams and, you know, all this stuff that distracts our tribal energy.
[01:34:24.093 --> 01:34:26.213]  Our tribal energy should be pro-human.
[01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:30.875]  Get Team Humanity t-shirts now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:34:31.116 --> 01:34:32.216]  They're a fundraiser shirt.

[01:34:34.437 --> 01:34:35.457]  Get your Team Humanity.
[01:34:35.477 --> 01:34:36.978]  Two different designs, unisex.
[01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:40.800]  InfoWarStore.com or my book, or both.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.820]  The Great Awakening, signed or unsigned.
[01:34:43.281 --> 01:34:43.641]  All right.
[01:34:44.361 --> 01:34:47.482]  Few more calls and Stu Peters live in studio.
[01:34:48.343 --> 01:34:53.325]  There's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, the world government's here with all its satanic bells and whistles.
[01:34:53.985 --> 01:34:57.967]  But there's also no doubt that humanity is rising to the challenge.
[01:34:59.767 --> 01:35:01.808]  Let's go to Roman in New Mexico.
[01:35:01.848 --> 01:35:02.508]  You're on the air.
[01:35:02.568 --> 01:35:02.929]  Welcome.
[01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:07.450]  Alex Jones!
[01:35:07.791 --> 01:35:08.491]  Hey baby, what's up?
[01:35:09.574 --> 01:35:10.214]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:35:10.234 --> 01:35:10.995]  First time caller.
[01:35:11.035 --> 01:35:13.616]  So, I'm going to bring up two points to you.
[01:35:14.136 --> 01:35:20.059]  One being 2024 War Front, and then the second, I'm not sure if you read it, but the Book of Enoch.
[01:35:20.979 --> 01:35:25.161]  I'm going to give you my thoughts on the War Front, and if you don't mind dissecting it.
[01:35:25.402 --> 01:35:26.602]  Yeah, I'm not screening your call.
[01:35:26.642 --> 01:35:30.264]  People call into the show, and then once they get on air, they're talking to a call screener.
[01:35:30.284 --> 01:35:31.204]  You're on the air right now.
[01:35:32.185 --> 01:35:33.025]  Oh, yeah, I'm speaking.
[01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:33.846]  Can you hear me?
[01:35:34.166 --> 01:35:36.227]  No, no, you're on the air right now, so go ahead and make your point.
[01:35:37.096 --> 01:35:37.777]  Okay, yeah.
[01:35:37.817 --> 01:35:38.558]  So here's the thing.
[01:35:38.838 --> 01:35:45.766]  North Korea, obviously, and Iran, China, Taiwan, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, and pretty much the whole Middle East.
[01:35:46.226 --> 01:35:53.615]  I think something with this is that whenever we're going to initiate these wars, I think it's going to be the first thing that happens.
[01:35:54.075 --> 01:35:56.558]  And whenever we do, our entire military is going to play.
[01:35:57.330 --> 01:36:01.293]  I agree, and now they're hyping the grids about to go down any minute, the Russians, the Trump supporters.
[01:36:01.314 --> 01:36:03.055]  I mean, it's ridiculously obvious.
[01:36:02.875 --> 01:36:07.475]   as the active duty portion. But if I was a bad guy, at that point, I would drop the grid
[01:36:07.475 --> 01:36:10.914]  and then, you know, red dawn situation.
[01:36:10.914 --> 01:36:15.515]   But no, I agree. And now they're hyping the grids about to go down any minute. The Russians,
[01:36:15.515 --> 01:36:20.875]   the Trump supporters, that I mean, it's ridiculously obvious they're desperate and we need to tell
[01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.434]  them, hey, you're you're COVID rollout blew up in your face.
[01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:25.030]  This will blow up even bigger.
[01:36:25.090 --> 01:36:26.470]  People are watching you.
[01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:27.851]  We know what you're doing.
[01:36:28.911 --> 01:36:29.511]  Absolutely.
[01:36:29.611 --> 01:36:32.972]  And I think the military has a pretty good pull from that as well.
[01:36:33.072 --> 01:36:35.773]  But as when I say the military, I'm not talking about the leadership.
[01:36:35.793 --> 01:36:40.934]  The leadership right now is trash and it stinks, to be honest with you, but this kind of is what it is.
[01:36:40.954 --> 01:36:44.174]  Some things I think that might assist with that, obviously keeping the military here.
[01:36:44.535 --> 01:36:46.575]  No nonsense wars, like we have our own problems here.
[01:36:47.464 --> 01:36:49.105]  Secondary, we've got to develop some militias.
[01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:50.866]  Counties need to come together.
[01:36:50.886 --> 01:36:54.988]  Military leadership, somehow or another, we need to un-brainwash them.
[01:36:55.929 --> 01:36:58.510]  And lastly, I think, you know, fixing slash ignoring.
[01:36:58.810 --> 01:37:03.693]  The militias are in the Constitution, and I love how Michigan towns, the towns are setting them up.
[01:37:03.713 --> 01:37:06.034]  So they're not secret and run by feds.
[01:37:06.094 --> 01:37:12.637]  No, they're out in the open, civil defense militias, medical militias, defense militias, posses.
[01:37:13.078 --> 01:37:15.399]  We need official, open men and women.
[01:37:15.839 --> 01:37:16.279]  More than ever.
[01:37:16.379 --> 01:37:17.060]  More than ever.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:22.298]   ready to fight fires, to support the fire department, to help during medical emergencies,
[01:37:22.298 --> 01:37:25.420]   to help feed the starving, and to help defend against criminal gangs.
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:28.600]   Because the feds aren't going to do it, they're dissolving our cities, we're going to have
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.440]  to reconstitute together, and the militia is the answer.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:33.439]  More than ever.
[01:37:33.439 --> 01:37:34.439]  More than ever.
[01:37:34.439 --> 01:37:37.880]   And you know, the military, I think the only reason the military would ever attack the
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:43.039]   American citizens is with Dick Durbin's, his bill trying to get illegal immigrants in,
[01:37:43.677 --> 01:37:49.739]  I don't understand how anybody even thinks that's a decent idea or how he hasn't been impeached just with that thought alone.
[01:37:49.819 --> 01:37:53.581]  But pretty much, that's the only point I got with the 2024 war fronts.
[01:37:53.621 --> 01:37:55.921]  But the next is a book at Enoch, and I'm curious if you've read it.
[01:37:55.941 --> 01:37:58.202]  Yeah, I've read some of the book at Enoch.
[01:37:58.242 --> 01:37:58.782]  Very interesting.
[01:37:59.703 --> 01:37:59.943]  It is.
[01:37:59.963 --> 01:38:00.763]  It's very interesting.
[01:38:00.923 --> 01:38:08.546]  And it kind of puts a lot of responsibility on what's going on with the names of the angels, the fallen angels that have came through.
[01:38:09.495 --> 01:38:14.238]  They're condemned to hell and, you know, misery loves company, so they're trying to take as many of us as possible.
[01:38:15.299 --> 01:38:19.041]  And with that, I'm actually curious, do you believe that the four horsemen are here?
[01:38:20.942 --> 01:38:22.042]  There are many antichrists.
[01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:23.223]  There are many antichrist spirits.
[01:38:23.243 --> 01:38:24.224]  There's a final antichrist.
[01:38:24.244 --> 01:38:29.367]  The devil keeps changing his plan, but keeps trying basically the same plan over and over again.
[01:38:29.467 --> 01:38:31.848]  So, you know, no one knows the time.
[01:38:31.908 --> 01:38:35.330]  Christ, anybody that tells you that knows the time, you know, is a liar.
[01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:38.272]  And so I'm just going to fight evil and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:38:39.352 --> 01:38:39.592]  Okay.
[01:38:39.852 --> 01:38:45.955]  And then lastly, uh, this is kind of a statement more than it is a question, but I personally believe we're getting closer and closer to tribulation.
[01:38:45.975 --> 01:38:49.236]  Uh, with Satan, you know, he's trying to become like God.
[01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:50.556]  He's trying to become omnipresent.
[01:38:50.917 --> 01:38:53.598]  What better way to do that when, than with AI, right?
[01:38:53.658 --> 01:38:55.678]  Like Wi-Fi routers can read out rooms and- 100%!
[01:38:57.379 --> 01:39:02.882]  Telephone's tracking you everywhere, and then CERN being the next power babble, and I think we're getting closer and closer and closer.
[01:39:03.342 --> 01:39:06.964]  You know, I pray every day that our country's safe, the world's safe, and people take care of us.
[01:39:06.984 --> 01:39:07.564]  I pray for you.
[01:39:07.644 --> 01:39:11.946]  I pray for... Brother, let me just say, since you asked my personal opinion, I'm not going to say I know it.
[01:39:12.506 --> 01:39:13.346]  I think we're in the birth pains.
[01:39:13.406 --> 01:39:15.988]  I think we're in the beginning of what comes to the tribulation.
[01:39:16.008 --> 01:39:16.508]  I agree with you.
[01:39:16.928 --> 01:39:18.589]  Alright, Stu Peters is coming up.
[01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:19.889]  First, got a clip of Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:21.050]  It's coming up.
[01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:22.551]  Stu Peters in studio.
[01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:23.731]  Can't wait to hear what he has to cover.
[01:39:24.231 --> 01:39:24.992]  InfoWars.com.
[01:39:25.532 --> 01:39:32.837]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[01:39:33.037 --> 01:39:43.324]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[01:39:44.124 --> 01:39:50.209]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[01:39:58.113 --> 01:40:05.455]  What if you had a chance to stand up against everything the UN and Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and all these globalists are doing?
[01:40:05.895 --> 01:40:06.815]  Would you support it?
[01:40:07.175 --> 01:40:07.835]  Well, guess what?
[01:40:08.015 --> 01:40:09.996]  We're not some fly-by-night operation.
[01:40:10.016 --> 01:40:11.116]  I've been on the air 29 years.
[01:40:11.436 --> 01:40:13.977]  And we have devastated the New World Order together.
[01:40:14.517 --> 01:40:16.898]  But now more than ever, I need your support.

[01:40:48.708 --> 01:40:51.610]  I respectfully ask for your support, and I thank you for your support.
[01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:52.290]  God bless.
[01:40:56.784 --> 01:41:04.506]  You can ask any question at all without fear of shame or public disclosure, and we will give you the most honest possible answer.
[01:41:04.866 --> 01:41:09.627]  I got drunk at a wedding recently and argued with the father of the bride about Trump.
[01:41:10.027 --> 01:41:13.107]  He's a raging liberal and was being loud and obnoxious.
[01:41:13.207 --> 01:41:16.208]  My wife says I have to apologize to the whole family.
[01:41:16.788 --> 01:41:17.208]  Should I?
[01:41:17.748 --> 01:41:19.289]  Well, no and yes.
[01:41:19.409 --> 01:41:21.449]  No, you should not apologize to the whole family.
[01:41:21.469 --> 01:41:22.889]  You didn't argue with the whole family.
[01:41:22.909 --> 01:41:25.310]  You argued with the drunk, obnoxious liberal.
[01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:27.375]  Who is the father of the bride.
[01:41:27.817 --> 01:41:29.823]  And yes, you should apologize to him.
[01:41:30.879 --> 01:41:32.801]  There are three things to know about apologies.
[01:41:33.261 --> 01:41:33.481]  Okay?
[01:41:33.901 --> 01:41:36.904]  The first is that if you're going to do it, you have to go all the way.
[01:41:36.944 --> 01:41:38.725]  This was the advice my father gave me when I was a kid.
[01:41:38.745 --> 01:41:39.826]  He's like, it's like pregnancy.
[01:41:40.386 --> 01:41:42.268]  Maybe you want to enter into it, maybe you don't.
[01:41:42.688 --> 01:41:44.229]  But once you do, you're all in.
[01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:47.912]  There's nothing more pointless or counterproductive than a half-hearted apology.
[01:41:47.932 --> 01:41:50.735]  If you're going to apologize, go all the way.
[01:41:51.335 --> 01:41:51.495]  Okay?
[01:41:51.515 --> 01:41:55.919]  The second thing to know about an apology is that it frees you.
[01:41:57.588 --> 01:42:02.477]  If there's any question about whether you did something wrong, just admit it.
[01:42:03.337 --> 01:42:04.417]  Why do you care?
[01:42:04.977 --> 01:42:05.558]  You don't care.
[01:42:05.978 --> 01:42:08.378]  Because you know exactly who you are, you're not insecure.
[01:42:09.078 --> 01:42:11.119]  Why do you care what this guy thinks of you?
[01:42:11.479 --> 01:42:11.939]  You shouldn't.
[01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:13.639]  His opinion is not worth anything.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:22.662]  So to apologize to him frees you from any obligation to him, or any thought about him, or any worry about him.
[01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:24.942]  And it does the third thing, which is why it's a good idea.
[01:42:25.622 --> 01:42:27.243]  It establishes you as the boss.
[01:42:27.803 --> 01:42:29.523]  It is the ultimate power move.
[01:42:29.803 --> 01:42:32.204]  To look him straight in the face and say, you know, I'm sorry I got drunk.
[01:42:33.021 --> 01:42:37.488]  And I didn't mean to argue with you, and it was a wedding, and I'm sorry that I did.
[01:42:38.771 --> 01:42:42.737]  And he's thinking to himself, there's obviously some sort of backhanded attack here.
[01:42:42.937 --> 01:42:43.979]  He doesn't really mean that.
[01:42:43.999 --> 01:42:46.022]  And you stare straight in his face and say, I'm really sorry about that.
[01:42:46.042 --> 01:42:47.124]  I hope you'll forgive me for doing that.
[01:42:48.174 --> 01:42:49.515]  Who's dad in that scenario?
[01:42:49.895 --> 01:42:50.616]  Who's the boss?
[01:42:51.276 --> 01:42:51.656]  Is it him?
[01:42:51.676 --> 01:42:51.716]  No.
[01:42:53.497 --> 01:42:53.958]  It's you.
[01:42:53.978 --> 01:42:56.079]  Because you're the one who rose above it.
[01:42:56.479 --> 01:43:02.163]  You care so little about his opinion that it doesn't bother you even for a second to say you're sorry.
[01:43:02.183 --> 01:43:03.624]  Because it's not that meaningful.
[01:43:03.984 --> 01:43:04.444]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:04.824 --> 01:43:05.225]  And mean it.
[01:43:05.485 --> 01:43:06.025]  Don't smirk.
[01:43:06.185 --> 01:43:07.046]  Don't be sarcastic.
[01:43:08.487 --> 01:43:09.708]  You win when you do that.
[01:43:09.728 --> 01:43:12.850]  Because, by the way, why were you arguing with this guy in the first place?
[01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:14.070]  Do you have nothing else to do?
[01:43:14.691 --> 01:43:15.271]  At a wedding?
[01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:32.281]  You could be dancing, you could be wooing your wife, talking to people, normal people, not angry MSNBC viewers, and yet you, because you have no self-control or anything better to do, your schedule is not packed enough, you wound up arguing with some douchebag about Trump?
[01:43:33.439 --> 01:43:36.061]  You're not plowing new ground there, arguing about Trump.
[01:43:36.601 --> 01:43:38.622]  What is it?
[01:43:38.642 --> 01:43:38.622]  2017?
[01:43:38.962 --> 01:43:39.423]  Please!
[01:43:39.443 --> 01:43:43.785]  You're not going to win that argument, win the argument, convince him of anything.
[01:43:44.105 --> 01:43:45.786]  Of course, he watches MSNBC!
[01:43:46.827 --> 01:43:48.448]  He hates you because you exist!
[01:43:49.168 --> 01:43:50.229]  Don't engage with him!
[01:43:51.069 --> 01:43:51.430]  You're right.
[01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:55.512]  Trump's a genocidal, maniac, fascist Nazi!
[01:43:56.193 --> 01:43:56.413]  Alright.
[01:43:57.033 --> 01:43:57.413]  You're great.
[01:43:58.314 --> 01:43:59.835]  And go on and have fun.
[01:44:00.595 --> 01:44:12.568]   If you want to win, In other words, if when all this is over, you want to be in the top spot, maybe not financially, but spiritually, enjoy yourself.
[01:44:12.928 --> 01:44:16.849]  Don't get caught up in the traps before you like assholes like that.
[01:44:17.349 --> 01:44:18.329]  So of course you apologize.
[01:44:18.349 --> 01:44:20.850]  Plus, your wife will take the same message.
[01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:22.150]  You're a bigger man.
[01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.810]  That's true.
[01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:23.770]  You should do that.
[01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:24.710]  You lose nothing.
[01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:27.351]  Alright, second question.
[01:44:28.951 --> 01:44:32.951]  My daughter's best friend recently started an OnlyFans.
[01:44:32.951 --> 01:44:42.230]  Man, Tucker is really unleashed now that he's not at Fox.
[01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:44.350]  And they go, "Oh, he doesn't have a show anymore."
[01:44:44.348 --> 01:44:47.110]  Yeah, it just gets 50 million views, 100 million views instead of 5 million.
[01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:52.194]  Stu Peters is a really interesting, informative guy, and he's here with us in studio.
[01:44:52.214 --> 01:44:54.615]  He's also going to interview me later today for his show.
[01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:57.137]  He's been a former bounty hunter and so much more.
[01:44:57.157 --> 01:44:58.038]  StuPeters.com.
[01:44:58.378 --> 01:44:59.599]  RealStuPeters on Twitter.
[01:45:00.279 --> 01:45:11.143]  I disagree with some of the stuff you said, but what I think overall we agree on, 95%, is a sense of urgency and that we have an out-of-control, illegitimate system that's really working against us.
[01:45:11.703 --> 01:45:13.664]  So, Stu, there's so much to cover here with you.
[01:45:13.724 --> 01:45:15.384]  It's great to have you in studio with us.
[01:45:15.825 --> 01:45:17.605]  I'm excited to go on your show as well.
[01:45:18.085 --> 01:45:19.306]  What do you want to dive into first?
[01:45:19.386 --> 01:45:20.746]  Well, I mean, just exactly that.
[01:45:20.846 --> 01:45:23.467]  We have an illegitimate government that we're not going to be able to vote our way out of.
[01:45:23.607 --> 01:45:26.889]  So the sense of urgency, you know, is incumbent upon us.
[01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:29.671]  You've been doing this for decades, right?
[01:45:31.073 --> 01:45:33.315]  And now, you know, alone for so long.
[01:45:33.916 --> 01:45:36.038]  And now, so many people are waking up.
[01:45:36.619 --> 01:45:39.022]  Alternative media is obviously exploding.
[01:45:39.562 --> 01:45:43.006]  The fake, controlled press is becoming more and more irrelevant.
[01:45:43.026 --> 01:45:44.027]  People aren't listening anymore.
[01:45:44.668 --> 01:45:55.918]  But I feel like there's so many people that are still preparing their dinner in their kitchen, going to soccer practice, going home, hustle and bustle, Christmas season time, pagan holiday celebrations.
[01:45:56.539 --> 01:46:02.885]  They get tied up in turning on the TV and doing whatever it is that they tell them to do, which is why we now have so many people dying suddenly.
[01:46:04.126 --> 01:46:07.849]  People are injecting themselves with pharmaceuticals that are coming from countries that are adversarial to us.
[01:46:09.116 --> 01:46:11.379]  Our whole system has been infiltrated, all of it.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:15.345]  So if we can't vote our way out of it, one of your callers was talking about a militia.
[01:46:15.926 --> 01:46:19.070]  Okay, well, we need to be like 100 or 200 million strong.
[01:46:19.651 --> 01:46:22.014]  Because they literally are trying to kill us.
[01:46:22.415 --> 01:46:22.695]  And so...
[01:46:23.803 --> 01:46:25.384]  You mentioned globalists, right?
[01:46:27.585 --> 01:46:31.667]  People are always talking about they, they are out of control, they are killing us.
[01:46:32.208 --> 01:46:34.229]  We have to identify who the real enemy is.
[01:46:34.449 --> 01:46:36.850]  We have to know where does this infiltration come from.
[01:46:37.710 --> 01:46:50.447]   And when you really step back and take an honest look at every single level of our federal bureaucracy, There's one little nation-state of Israel that everybody's afraid to talk about, and it's the one thing that'll get you nuked off the face of the planet.
[01:46:50.887 --> 01:47:01.210]  It'll get you nuked off the internet, it'll get your Twitter shut down, it'll get you kicked off of Rumble, it'll scare advertisers away from doing business with you, if you talk about Zionist infiltration.
[01:47:01.751 --> 01:47:08.593]  So, if that's the one sensitive subject that nobody wants us to talk about, then I think it's pretty obvious that's the thing that we should be talking about.
[01:47:09.193 --> 01:47:13.636]  One country, one entity, one group of people is infiltrating every single level of our bureaucracy.
[01:47:14.157 --> 01:47:25.904]  We have United States Congress people that can't even swear an oath to the Constitution and take office here to do the bidding of the people of the United States of America until they get the blessings of the nation-state of Israel.
[01:47:26.525 --> 01:47:27.425]  That's a scary thought.
[01:47:27.846 --> 01:47:34.983]   They have to go there, they have to swear an allegiance to a foreign state We have to swear all of this money to the so-called greatest ally.
[01:47:35.043 --> 01:47:36.243]  Where is this narrative coming from?
[01:47:36.623 --> 01:47:37.983]  What makes them our greatest ally?
[01:47:38.764 --> 01:47:41.064]  What kind of damage have they done in our country already?
[01:47:41.104 --> 01:47:42.745]  What kind of damage are they continuing to do?
[01:47:42.785 --> 01:47:44.105]  Where are all these wars coming from?
[01:47:44.505 --> 01:47:48.026]  Every single one of these proxy wars goes back to the funding of the Rothschilds.
[01:47:48.046 --> 01:47:50.446]  They've been involved with every single intervention that we've had.
[01:47:51.107 --> 01:47:52.487]  The criminal central banking cabal.
[01:47:53.564 --> 01:48:01.747]  This is the banking cabal that Vladimir Putin kicked out of Russia and said, no, we're going to care about the interests of our country.
[01:48:02.147 --> 01:48:03.967]  We're going to care about the interests of our people.
[01:48:04.908 --> 01:48:05.948]  That's nationalism.
[01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:13.411]  And to destroy America from the inside out, they have to destroy the very idea of nationalism.
[01:48:14.191 --> 01:48:15.691]  And that's what's being attacked right now.
[01:48:16.232 --> 01:48:17.132]  We're so divided.
[01:48:19.073 --> 01:48:19.674]  We're conquered.
[01:48:20.134 --> 01:48:21.535]  We are an occupied country.
[01:48:22.296 --> 01:48:23.136]  We don't have a government.
[01:48:23.336 --> 01:48:27.120]  We have a rogue, murderous corporate crime syndicate.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.342]  And we don't have any representation in our government.
[01:48:30.883 --> 01:48:32.084]  And that's a scary place to be.
[01:48:32.284 --> 01:48:33.204]  So let me ask you this.
[01:48:34.375 --> 01:48:36.536]  I don't like Israel firsters in our government.
[01:48:37.516 --> 01:48:39.958]  I don't like the chi-coms heavily involved in our government either.
[01:48:40.298 --> 01:48:42.999]  But I'm also not against Jews or against Israel in general.
[01:48:43.679 --> 01:48:51.123]  And so I think, and I'm not pooh-poohing what you're saying, but I'm saying on a third-dimensional level, there's absolutely a big bureaucracy.
[01:48:51.723 --> 01:48:56.265]  There's a lot of propaganda to just go on with whatever Israel says, whoever's in charge at the time.
[01:48:56.645 --> 01:48:58.406]  But Israel has a civil war going on.
[01:48:58.426 --> 01:49:07.007]   Netanyahu is in a parliamentary position where he has less votes than Justin Trudeau who's been elected with 27% of the vote.
[01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:12.166]   Because in a parliamentary system for Americans, you have the majority here of the voters.
[01:49:12.166 --> 01:49:13.166]  Not in the parliamentary.
[01:49:13.166 --> 01:49:17.207]   You can get like Merkel 25% and they get other coalitions to join you.
[01:49:17.207 --> 01:49:20.126]  So I don't see Israel just as one bloc.
[01:49:20.126 --> 01:49:23.487]   And there comes this fetish though to like say, well is someone anti-Israel or are they
[01:49:23.487 --> 01:49:24.126]  pro-Israel?
[01:49:24.716 --> 01:49:32.143]  My issue is, is it gets very, very sophisticated and you have a lot of other big players and big operations.
[01:49:32.163 --> 01:49:33.864]  So I don't mind sitting there and what you said.
[01:49:33.884 --> 01:49:35.366]  I figured you'd talk like that.
[01:49:36.087 --> 01:49:52.527]   Talking about that, my issue is, is that I don't think at the end of the day, if we just erased Israel off the map, or if all the Jews on the planet were teleported to another world, that our problems would end.
[01:49:52.647 --> 01:49:57.549]  I mean, are you saying Israel is the problem?
[01:49:57.989 --> 01:50:00.329]  And if so, who is Israel?
[01:50:00.689 --> 01:50:01.369]  What is their aim?
[01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:03.710]  Well, they're certainly not the Israel of the Bible.
[01:50:05.415 --> 01:50:15.204]  This is a pro-homosexual, pro-baby-murdering, abortion-loving, mandate-fifth-booster for your entire population.
[01:50:15.724 --> 01:50:19.727]  They're all injected with this mRNA bioweapon poison.
[01:50:19.748 --> 01:50:22.210]  But isn't that the rest of the West?
[01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:26.293]  No, this is the secular state of Israel that I'm talking about.
[01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:32.939]  This is devil-worshipping, satanic Zionism.
[01:50:34.019 --> 01:50:36.920]  I'm not talking about real practicing Jews.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.701]  None of these people that we're talking about... Sure, you've got the Neutrocarty and the Orthodox Jews don't like it either.
[01:50:43.142 --> 01:50:46.323]  I mean, look, where did Epstein come from?
[01:50:47.203 --> 01:50:48.603]  Where does the Mossad operate?
[01:50:49.704 --> 01:50:59.947]  Why are we, without question, forced to send hundreds of billions of dollars to this nation-state that's killing... So are you saying if Israel disappeared, our problems would be solved?
[01:51:00.647 --> 01:51:01.287]  A lot of them, yes.
[01:51:02.012 --> 01:51:02.433]  How much?
[01:51:02.853 --> 01:51:02.433]  90%?
[01:51:03.814 --> 01:51:06.256]  50%?
[01:51:04.234 --> 01:51:06.256]  Well, let's take a look at Biden's cabinet.
[01:51:06.436 --> 01:51:09.558]  How about all of the people that are making decisions for the State Department?
[01:51:10.039 --> 01:51:11.020]  How much money we're sending?
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.181]  How many missiles we're lobbying?
[01:51:12.201 --> 01:51:18.666]  We're killing millions of people and spending trillions of dollars on behalf of this small little country called Israel.
[01:51:19.186 --> 01:51:25.672]  I mean, really, the entire military-industrial complex is infiltrated by Zionists from Israel.
[01:51:26.996 --> 01:51:31.155]   The military industrial by the way everybody always thinks I'm pre-planning my show.
[01:51:31.155 --> 01:51:33.715]   I heard a few days ago you wanted to come to town. I said great come in here.
[01:51:33.715 --> 01:51:37.155]   We didn't talk about what you were going to cover. No. I'm just saying everybody that thinks my show
[01:51:37.155 --> 01:51:41.076]   is all calculated. I just have a guest on and yeah Alex will tell you that we decided at six
[01:51:41.076 --> 01:51:44.275]   o'clock last night that we were coming down last night stayed at the hotel and here we are. Yeah
[01:51:44.275 --> 01:51:49.235]   and when I asked what you're about to talk about my whole issue here is um
[01:51:49.235 --> 01:51:55.875]   I mean if you want to talk about one racial group and I'm not playing Chinese people they're
[01:51:55.875 --> 01:52:00.836]   they're homogeneous a billion five hundred million people uh and China believes they're going to
[01:52:00.836 --> 01:52:05.475]   racially supremacist the world and they own Hollywood they don't run Hollywood and I talk
[01:52:05.475 --> 01:52:09.315]   about China being a major issue people oh you're making up it's the Zionists they're and everything
[01:52:10.064 --> 01:52:14.168]  So it's like, Israel's this little bitty country with a very small population.
[01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:21.212]  And if I fall into a banana peel, I don't say it's the Chinese Communists, but they're in our business big time.
[01:52:21.532 --> 01:52:22.713]  I'm not saying they run everything either.
[01:52:23.373 --> 01:52:31.497]  I don't see, I see, you know, Israel, whoever runs it at the time, having a lot of power and definitely laundering money and corrupting all the rest of it, just like all these governments.
[01:52:32.158 --> 01:52:38.081]  I just, what about all these other, what about the French government or the UK government or the, you know, the Venezuelan government?
[01:52:38.101 --> 01:52:45.534]   I mean, to me, it's just like Israel's this tiny little country and I get it controls a lot of US policy, but All of it.
[01:52:46.495 --> 01:52:47.416]  It controls all of U.S.
[01:52:47.456 --> 01:52:47.636]  policy.
[01:52:47.696 --> 01:52:49.477]  Venezuela doesn't impact our policy.
[01:52:49.517 --> 01:52:51.238]  We're not bombing people on behalf of Israel.
[01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:53.039]  We're not killing millions.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.840]  We can't pump oil here.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:59.463]  He shut down new permits, Biden, but we're getting our oil now from Venezuela.
[01:52:59.503 --> 01:53:00.944]  I'm not saying Venezuela runs things.
[01:53:01.004 --> 01:53:04.026]  I'm saying I don't get this thing.
[01:53:04.227 --> 01:53:06.088]  I'm not saying you're completely wrong about everything.
[01:53:08.676 --> 01:53:10.837]  People love to say, I work for Israel.
[01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:13.078]  All I have is the ADL saying, shut me down and suing me.
[01:53:13.478 --> 01:53:15.439]  I'm certainly not getting checks from them, I'll tell you that.
[01:53:15.459 --> 01:53:20.361]  But at the same time, do you think the average Jew is in on this?
[01:53:21.481 --> 01:53:21.641]  No.
[01:53:22.002 --> 01:53:23.082]  I mean, not practicing Jews.
[01:53:24.282 --> 01:53:34.767]  Messianic practicing Jews are worshipping Jesus Christ just like in 1776, you know, those men that made all of those sacrifices to liberate a country when they were defeated.
[01:53:34.827 --> 01:53:35.307]  George Washington.
[01:53:35.327 --> 01:53:37.528]  So you're saying if they're not a Messianic Jew, they're in on it?
[01:53:39.505 --> 01:53:39.665]  No.
[01:53:41.607 --> 01:53:49.179]   I am saying that the nation state of Israel and the power structure there funded by the likes of vanguard and black rock and state
[01:53:49.179 --> 01:53:52.818]   street in the rothschilds who control a hundred percent of our media
[01:53:52.818 --> 01:53:56.097]   have been able to gaslight and propagandize everybody into this
[01:53:56.097 --> 01:53:59.458]   unfettered unquestionable support for this nation state of israel
[01:53:59.458 --> 01:54:02.617]   that is infiltrating our government at every single level well i think it's
[01:54:02.617 --> 01:54:06.179]   very very quiet i think it's very fair question and if you say to the average
[01:54:06.179 --> 01:54:08.498]   person they don't know
[01:54:08.498 --> 01:54:12.398]   that our congress members are are are representatives at the federal level
[01:54:12.398 --> 01:54:15.738]   have to actually swear an allegiance to this foreign state before they can take
[01:54:15.738 --> 01:54:19.738]   the oath of our own Constitution to do the bidding of our people.
[01:54:19.881 --> 01:54:21.202]  That should concern everybody.
[01:54:21.242 --> 01:54:21.663]  No, I agree.
[01:54:21.683 --> 01:54:22.884]  We should not have dual loyalties.
[01:54:23.824 --> 01:54:24.725]  Or dual citizenship.
[01:54:26.106 --> 01:54:29.769]  These people control our... Well, Israel's not the only place with dual citizenship.
[01:54:29.809 --> 01:54:33.351]  But listen, these people control our military-industrial complex.
[01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:39.015]  These people fund Lockheed Martin and Raytheon so that we can go and make missile testing sites in Ukraine.
[01:54:39.055 --> 01:54:40.336]  Why are we fighting a war in Ukraine?
[01:54:40.636 --> 01:54:41.837]  Has Congress declared a war?
[01:54:42.057 --> 01:54:42.178]  No.
[01:54:42.978 --> 01:54:43.899]  So that's Jews too?
[01:54:44.039 --> 01:54:47.302]  So if Congress hasn't declared a war, we're funding... So the whole Ukraine thing is Jews too?
[01:54:47.783 --> 01:54:50.905]  Yeah, it all points back to Israel.
[01:54:51.286 --> 01:54:54.869]  Explain to me, because I thought it was a NATO battle with Russia.
[01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:56.911]  They've been using that for a proxy war.
[01:54:56.931 --> 01:55:00.494]  I know Zelensky's Jewish, but what... Who controls NATO?
[01:55:02.116 --> 01:55:04.238]  Who funds NATO?
[01:55:04.698 --> 01:55:05.619]  75% the United States of America.
[01:55:05.639 --> 01:55:06.660]  Where does that funding come from?
[01:55:07.245 --> 01:55:19.730]  Every single military intervention that we have ever been involved with is funded by the same group of people and enriches these NGOs and enriches the fat cats like Lindsey Graham and, you know, the Turtle Lord Mitch McConnell and the DC Beltway.
[01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:22.591]  These people are killing millions of innocent people.
[01:55:22.891 --> 01:55:43.548]   We talked last time, I don't know if it was on my show or yours, we talked about What's happening in Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas where 50% of the population is under the age of 15, 75% is under the age of 25, and you have members of Congress demanding that we go blow up apartment buildings and nuke these people off the face of the planet.
[01:55:43.829 --> 01:55:46.031]  What is the benchmark for success in Gaza?
[01:55:46.584 --> 01:55:53.526]  Well, I certainly think that you can't target a civilian population because there's a terror group within it.
[01:55:53.606 --> 01:55:56.227]  I've said I think this is terrible PR for Israel.
[01:55:56.267 --> 01:55:57.787]  Here's my next question.
[01:55:57.807 --> 01:55:58.647]  Just say it how it is.
[01:55:58.687 --> 01:56:02.168]  They're war criminals, and they're committing war crimes right on Twitter, right out in front of the world.
[01:56:02.188 --> 01:56:03.108]  They're bragging about killing here.
[01:56:03.128 --> 01:56:07.210]  Well, then you can argue the Marines did it in Fallujah because we got attacked from the city, so we leveled it.
[01:56:07.330 --> 01:56:08.870]  Let's just expand on this for a moment.
[01:56:11.084 --> 01:56:13.526]  See, Stu, I'm not condescending to you.
[01:56:14.007 --> 01:56:15.368]  I think you're a smart guy, okay?
[01:56:15.408 --> 01:56:18.170]  But I'm trying to really get you to think about something here.
[01:56:19.531 --> 01:56:26.857]  Harvard, Yale, Princeton, all basically say from the mountains to the sea, get rid of Israel.
[01:56:27.198 --> 01:56:28.479]  So to me, it's not black and white.
[01:56:28.519 --> 01:56:31.201]  You're either for Israel or for Hamas, vice versa.
[01:56:32.802 --> 01:56:33.243]  Why?
[01:56:35.177 --> 01:56:49.134]  Is all the academia and the leftists that are funded by BlackRock literally teaching that Jews are inherently evil, and they're attacking them all over the place, and the university's saying they're inherently bad, and that Islam is allied with the left?
[01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:54.014]  And then I agree, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit a leftist Jew in charge of it.
[01:56:54.215 --> 01:57:01.023]  There's some other people that aren't Jewish, but it's probably half Jewish people literally running the Islamic groups that hate the West and hate Israel.
[01:57:01.383 --> 01:57:05.508]  So I'm looking at this, you've got Israel over here, and then a bunch of leftist academics.
[01:57:06.329 --> 01:57:10.570]  Like Noam Chomsky saying the Muslims are little sweetie cakes, which they're not.
[01:57:10.630 --> 01:57:12.311]  They want to take over, on average.
[01:57:12.751 --> 01:57:24.595]  And I'm asking you then, if the Jews run everything, which I don't think they do, why is academia, that is the heart of the globalist, literally promoting the destruction of Israel?
[01:57:27.136 --> 01:57:33.278]  We have been gaslit and programmed about Israel for decades.
[01:57:35.288 --> 01:57:44.911]  And there are independent people at every level that are going to say things to get the normal person to think in a certain way.
[01:57:45.431 --> 01:57:52.136]   There is a cognitive disconnect in our country because of The media programming.
[01:57:52.436 --> 01:58:03.425]  Because people can't turn off the fake Fox News channel, and people can't turn off CNN or MSNBC, however you believe in this fake two-party representative government system.
[01:58:03.445 --> 01:58:04.846]  Well, I'm a conservative, so I'm going to watch Fox.
[01:58:05.466 --> 01:58:08.729]  Not knowing that they're funded by the same people.
[01:58:09.289 --> 01:58:14.471]   And so if academia is being infiltrated by the same people.
[01:58:15.091 --> 01:58:20.533]  In order to cause discord, in order to keep us divided, there has to be a contrary message.
[01:58:21.233 --> 01:58:25.614]  Now you're talking my turkey.
[01:58:26.314 --> 01:58:29.495]  It's a giant Hegelian dialectic.
[01:58:29.575 --> 01:58:34.949]   You have MSNBC, CNN, 80% of their coverage is pro-Palestinian.
[01:58:34.969 --> 01:58:36.529]  I'm not saying bad things aren't happening to them, it's terrible.
[01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:39.010]  We played the clips, the kids die and all this stuff.
[01:58:39.570 --> 01:58:41.731]  But I mean, there's a larger dialectic here.
[01:58:43.112 --> 01:58:43.632]  What is that?
[01:58:44.512 --> 01:58:45.673]  I mean, look at that.
[01:58:45.933 --> 01:58:46.953]  What is the Star of David?
[01:58:46.993 --> 01:58:48.254]  Is there a Star of David in the Bible?
[01:58:48.874 --> 01:58:49.354]  What is this?
[01:58:49.534 --> 01:58:50.174]  There actually is.
[01:58:50.234 --> 01:58:51.215]  It's the Seal of Solomon.
[01:58:53.336 --> 01:58:53.756]  Is that it?
[01:58:54.136 --> 01:58:55.316]  That's the Seal of Solomon, you know.
[01:58:55.597 --> 01:58:58.238]  That's the seal he was given by God to control any demons he wanted.
[01:59:00.137 --> 01:59:07.137]  Because to me that looks like a pentagram.
[01:59:07.137 --> 01:59:14.137]   Why are our sitting members of Congress wearing this nation state's flag on their lapel pins?
[01:59:14.726 --> 01:59:16.247]  I don't like the Ukraine flag.
[01:59:16.287 --> 01:59:17.588]  I'm not against Israel or Ukraine.
[01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:18.429]  I think it's weird.
[01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:22.873]  Well, given what's happening in our country... Well, this predates Bathomet.
[01:59:22.893 --> 01:59:24.034]  This is the Seal of Solomon.
[01:59:24.675 --> 01:59:25.255]  Pre-1940.
[01:59:25.416 --> 01:59:27.918]  Right?
[01:59:29.199 --> 01:59:30.560]  So, Ukraine.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.661]  Where did Ukraine come from?
[01:59:32.782 --> 01:59:33.663]  What happened in Ukraine in 2014?
[01:59:35.245 --> 01:59:37.726]  Our CIA affected a violent coup in that country.
[01:59:37.986 --> 01:59:38.646]  Why did they do that?
[01:59:39.206 --> 01:59:49.008]  Because the democratically elected administration, where both sides admitted that the vote was fair, that administration, prior to Zelensky's installation, was adopting some pro-Russia policies.
[01:59:49.068 --> 01:59:49.328]  Why?
[01:59:49.908 --> 02:00:04.631]  Because when the arbitrary borders of Ukraine, the fake borders of Ukraine, were established after Lenin's color revolution, that area, that uninhabited area, was settled by ethnic Russians.
[02:00:06.343 --> 02:00:07.584]  They wanted to just be Russia.
[02:00:08.665 --> 02:00:11.347]  There's a Jewish state in Russia people don't even know about.
[02:00:12.407 --> 02:00:13.588]  They wanted to just be Russia.
[02:00:14.949 --> 02:00:17.911]  And so we have to have a boogeyman to go bomb.
[02:00:17.991 --> 02:00:20.753]  Why is it just relentlessly Vladimir Putin who cares about the interests?
[02:00:20.773 --> 02:00:28.479]  This guy's an Orthodox Christian who has built, not abominations, but has built beautiful cathedrals and places of worship for Christians since his reign of power.
[02:00:29.451 --> 02:00:30.993]  He cares about the interests of his people.
[02:00:31.374 --> 02:00:33.437]  He's not going to be controlled by a one-world governance.
[02:00:33.477 --> 02:00:42.551]  From where I sit, it looks like this might be one of the only guys that's actually standing between what's left of the free world and whatever this one-world governance is that's rushing our way.
[02:00:44.312 --> 02:00:53.502]  I mean, we have the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, everybody that's making decisions about who we bomb and where, and what is the common element?
[02:00:53.802 --> 02:00:55.584]  The one thing that you're not allowed to talk about.
[02:00:55.885 --> 02:01:02.271]   And so if we have a big problem to talk about and a big problem to solve, It's going to be the thing that they want to shut you up about.
[02:01:02.311 --> 02:01:05.052]  No, I know, but let's put the seal of Solomon up.
[02:01:05.613 --> 02:01:07.474]  This is a lot bigger than Jews, my friend.
[02:01:07.514 --> 02:01:12.738]  This goes back to Babylon, and this goes back to ancient Egypt.
[02:01:13.178 --> 02:01:15.260]  That seal predates Solomon.
[02:01:16.581 --> 02:01:19.142]  And the point is, it is about ritual magic.
[02:01:19.262 --> 02:01:21.604]  So that's why they're all so obsessed with it.
[02:01:25.166 --> 02:01:25.767]  And they shouldn't be.
[02:01:27.373 --> 02:01:29.354]  We are a country founded under God.
[02:01:29.954 --> 02:01:31.574]  We are a Christian country.
[02:01:32.114 --> 02:01:35.455]  But you can say the stars on our flag are pentagrams right side up.
[02:01:35.495 --> 02:01:36.876]  A pentacle is just a symbol of a human.
[02:01:39.216 --> 02:01:41.777]  The behavior of those who have infiltrated our government.
[02:01:41.797 --> 02:01:42.497]  No, no, but a rainbow.
[02:01:42.577 --> 02:01:45.218]  God gave us a rainbow in Genesis.
[02:01:45.258 --> 02:01:46.518]  And now it represents Satan.
[02:01:46.538 --> 02:01:49.079]  But I mean, so what I'm saying, I don't see how a... I mean, take a star.
[02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:53.732]  A pentagram is an inverted person, okay?
[02:01:54.593 --> 02:01:54.853]  Alright?
[02:01:55.554 --> 02:01:57.796]  But a normal star is just a person.
[02:01:57.816 --> 02:01:58.696]  It's arms, legs.
[02:01:59.097 --> 02:01:59.957]  It's a symbol of a human.
[02:02:00.738 --> 02:02:05.222]  And you've got the pentagram that is a human upside down, which is anti-human.
[02:02:05.242 --> 02:02:06.083]  This is the death cult.
[02:02:06.383 --> 02:02:07.003]  This is the life cult.
[02:02:07.043 --> 02:02:08.725]  I don't see a star as satanic.
[02:02:09.385 --> 02:02:10.947]  Satanists use it because it's powerful.
[02:02:11.787 --> 02:02:18.204]   Just as I see the seal Solomon is not a satanic symbol it's a symbol of infinity
[02:02:18.204 --> 02:02:22.154]   very similar to the hourglass from another perspective. They use it because it's
[02:02:22.154 --> 02:02:25.984]   powerful and we were told well this is just this is the archetype this is actually
[02:02:25.984 --> 02:02:33.175]   the the symbol is an hourglass infinity that's just infinity laid over itself.
[02:02:33.175 --> 02:02:38.664]   Symbolism aside yeah do you believe that we don't have a problem with Zionist
[02:02:38.664 --> 02:02:41.146]   infiltration in our I mean, nobody can honestly say that.
[02:02:41.326 --> 02:02:44.807]  No, I think under the rubric of that, there's an organized crime syndicate doing whatever it wants.
[02:02:45.047 --> 02:02:45.987]  And there's a bunch of mafias.
[02:02:46.908 --> 02:02:47.548]  And it's murderous.
[02:02:47.908 --> 02:02:50.589]  And it's causing Americans and people... Let me ask you this.
[02:02:50.609 --> 02:02:54.390]  Why do you think the ADL said they want me shut down and Trump shut down?
[02:02:56.631 --> 02:02:58.192]  Well, the ADL wants you shut down because...
[02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:03.342]  You give a contrary message to what they pay for in the media.
[02:03:03.402 --> 02:03:03.762]  Exactly.
[02:03:03.782 --> 02:03:06.963]  So I'm not going to play their game and hate them and give them what they want.
[02:03:07.023 --> 02:03:08.144]  I'm just going to promote freedom.
[02:03:08.504 --> 02:03:11.185]  And they want to lie about me and be all racist and do all this.
[02:03:11.225 --> 02:03:11.565]  That's fine.
[02:03:11.585 --> 02:03:12.205]  People know now.
[02:03:12.545 --> 02:03:13.645]  I have my own page at the ADL.
[02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:14.426]  ADL.org.
[02:03:14.466 --> 02:03:16.286]  There's a Stu Peters page.
[02:03:16.967 --> 02:03:17.967]  Aren't you proud of that?
[02:03:17.987 --> 02:03:18.487]  Yeah, of course.
[02:03:18.507 --> 02:03:19.648]  There's not a better enemy to have.
[02:03:19.968 --> 02:03:21.368]  Died suddenly was anti-Semitic.
[02:03:22.008 --> 02:03:24.209]  We're telling people about, you know, poison.
[02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:25.149]  Well, that's another issue.
[02:03:25.169 --> 02:03:28.110]  You know, they targeted Jews with some of the worst shots in the world.
[02:03:28.150 --> 02:03:29.671]  Why didn't they get a gun out of jail free card?
[02:03:30.663 --> 02:03:31.605]  I'm not here to defend Jews.
[02:03:31.645 --> 02:03:34.449]  I'm just saying, I don't think the power structure is the Jews.
[02:03:34.469 --> 02:03:37.794]  I think it's more sophisticated.
[02:03:38.075 --> 02:03:39.036]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[02:03:40.253 --> 02:03:41.554]  Do Peters is our guest here.
[02:03:41.574 --> 02:03:43.174]  We did not talk before he came on.
[02:03:43.194 --> 02:03:45.155]  He said, I'm going to come to town interview and I want to come on.
[02:03:45.195 --> 02:03:49.458]  I said, I come on the show and we're going down the rabbit hole here on Israel.
[02:03:50.118 --> 02:03:53.299]  I certainly think the people that run Israel think that they can do whatever they want.
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:54.860]  There's a lot of arrogance there.
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:57.021]  I don't like any of these big modern Western governments.
[02:03:57.041 --> 02:03:59.262]  I think they're all despicable and disgusting.
[02:03:59.322 --> 02:04:02.124]  Israel clearly stood down on October 7th.
[02:04:02.184 --> 02:04:03.164]  I said that the day it happened.
[02:04:03.244 --> 02:04:04.365]  It's come out mainstream news.
[02:04:04.405 --> 02:04:05.105]  They admit they did.
[02:04:05.405 --> 02:04:06.486]  Where's the investigation of that?
[02:04:06.506 --> 02:04:07.887]  And you got Biden funding.
[02:04:08.627 --> 02:04:13.067]   Hezbollah through Iran to Hamas. There's a lot. You got Obama backing the Muslim
[02:04:13.067 --> 02:04:17.427]   Brotherhood you've got the West bringing all the Islamics in
[02:04:17.427 --> 02:04:24.027]   You've got the universities backing the Islamics against Israel. I see a much larger clash of civilizations
[02:04:24.027 --> 02:04:30.587]   Galian dialectic taking place During I and I want is in closing. I'd love to see
[02:04:30.587 --> 02:04:37.666]   It's in Canada or Australia or Germany or the US or Israel or Morocco or wherever I?
[02:04:38.148 --> 02:04:42.530]  I'd love to see patriots in Israel take their government back and not be part of this.
[02:04:42.671 --> 02:04:45.332]  I'd love to see... I mean, I just see them as people.
[02:04:46.213 --> 02:04:51.997]  As an America First guy, I'd rather see the American people intervene and rise up against this murderous government that we have here.
[02:04:53.338 --> 02:04:57.540]  And going back to the star thing, why do they call it the Star of David if it's the Seal of Solomon?
[02:04:58.301 --> 02:05:00.102]  I mean, this is... That's not biblical.
[02:05:00.382 --> 02:05:00.763]  That's just...
[02:05:01.743 --> 02:05:03.164]  More Jewish mysticism.
[02:05:03.344 --> 02:05:03.784]  It's fake.
[02:05:04.904 --> 02:05:07.885]  If you want to talk about what that is, look up the Star of Remfan.
[02:05:08.945 --> 02:05:10.526]  And talk about the ethnic Khazars.
[02:05:10.546 --> 02:05:11.406]  They're not even Jewish.
[02:05:11.466 --> 02:05:16.127]  These are the people who I'm talking about presenting a major problem, you know, globally.
[02:05:16.827 --> 02:05:19.508]  These people are responsible for the infiltration of our government.
[02:05:19.528 --> 02:05:20.448]  I think we need to talk about it.
[02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.929]  And look.
[02:05:22.389 --> 02:05:24.509]  You're welcome to.
[02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:32.220]   In Acts chapter 7, it says, Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of your god, Remfan.
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.041]  That's that star.
[02:05:36.402 --> 02:05:37.602]  So this is a false god.
[02:05:39.083 --> 02:05:40.563]  Pull out the star, Remfram.
[02:05:41.544 --> 02:05:42.524]  The star of Remfan.
[02:05:45.205 --> 02:05:50.428]  Figures which ye made to worship them, a false god, and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
[02:05:51.528 --> 02:06:12.141]   So if it's the star of David, and we call it the star of David, and it represents the nation-state of Israel, the secular, non-biblical nation-state of Israel, That's carrying out operations across the face of the planet, particularly inside of our own government, and has infiltrated our intelligence apparatus, the CIA, who's effecting violent coups in other countries to install governments that will do the bidding of the one world government.
[02:06:12.442 --> 02:06:13.363]  Who is funding it?
[02:06:13.463 --> 02:06:15.185]  Who is making it happen?
[02:06:15.905 --> 02:06:17.006]  Where is it all coming from?
[02:06:17.026 --> 02:06:24.135]  Well, there's definitely been an internal battle in the CIA between Mossad, MI6, and the CIA.
[02:06:24.475 --> 02:06:28.480]  And the CIA teaches the Mossad how to carry out operations on the American people.
[02:06:28.841 --> 02:06:31.844]  They teach MI6 how to carry out these operations.
[02:06:31.924 --> 02:06:33.807]  But I thought Mossad's in charge, though.
[02:06:35.208 --> 02:06:36.350]  How is the C.I.A.
[02:06:36.370 --> 02:06:36.891]  teaching them?
[02:06:36.911 --> 02:06:38.072]  Where does the funding come from?
[02:06:38.393 --> 02:06:39.675]  It's illegal for the C.I.A.
[02:06:39.715 --> 02:06:41.958]  to take and carry out operations on the American people.
[02:06:41.978 --> 02:06:43.801]  Not to say that they don't do it every single day.
[02:06:44.241 --> 02:06:46.885]  But that's what we did with the installation of a fake government in Ukraine.
[02:06:47.594 --> 02:06:49.475]  And then we just go bomb the hell out of everybody.
[02:06:49.976 --> 02:06:51.357]  All these military interventions.
[02:06:51.397 --> 02:06:52.718]  What are we going to do?
[02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:57.902]  We can get into Elon Musk, and the election, and the open borders.
[02:06:57.942 --> 02:07:00.163]  I don't know what we're going to talk about.
[02:07:00.183 --> 02:07:01.484]  We can do that, and I want to.
[02:07:02.385 --> 02:07:07.088]  But just to say... Who was dancing on September 11th?
[02:07:07.148 --> 02:07:08.029]  I'll never forget that.
[02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:09.930]  The dancing Israelis.
[02:07:11.412 --> 02:07:13.134]  I will never forget the USS Liberty.
[02:07:13.615 --> 02:07:20.666]   This is Israel that strafed the USS Liberty in cold blood, knowingly murdering And torpedoed.
[02:07:21.046 --> 02:07:21.726]  And torpedoed.
[02:07:21.827 --> 02:07:22.527]  And tried to sink.
[02:07:22.907 --> 02:07:24.508]  And then LBJ tries to cover it up.
[02:07:24.568 --> 02:07:24.769]  Why?
[02:07:25.169 --> 02:07:26.350]  This is our greatest ally?
[02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:38.278]  Have they ever fought alongside of us in one of these fake interventions that enriches all of these NGOs and sucks the blood right out of the American taxpayer while we kill millions of people for no purpose at all whatsoever?
[02:07:38.658 --> 02:07:44.122]  Name one military intervention that the Rothschilds have funded that has made the United States or its people safer.
[02:07:45.450 --> 02:08:10.461]  Why is our border intentionally open, right here, you're in Texas, why is our border intentionally open while this fake government orchestrates, implements, and carries out a physical invasion of our own country, but yet we send all of our country... Now you got my attention, because I don't like millions for Ukraine's border or Israel's, and I definitely agree with you that that's a point we should point out, and we're paying for their borders, they deserve borders, but we don't.
[02:08:11.104 --> 02:08:15.387]  And we send all of our military assets and billions of dollars to go protect their borders.
[02:08:16.308 --> 02:08:16.608]  Why?
[02:08:17.529 --> 02:08:19.531]  And why are we not allowed to ask that question?
[02:08:19.931 --> 02:08:21.192]  Who's making those decisions?
[02:08:21.532 --> 02:08:29.178]  When you look at the Biden cabinet and you look at ethnicity and heritage and where these people come from, these aren't practicing Jews.
[02:08:29.298 --> 02:08:31.440]  That's not the claim that I'm making here.
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:34.082]  I'm not alleging that Jewish people are bad.
[02:08:34.102 --> 02:08:35.863]  I'm talking about the Khazars.
[02:08:35.924 --> 02:08:38.025]  I'm talking about the Zionists.
[02:08:38.806 --> 02:08:39.987]  And I think it's a big problem.
[02:08:41.239 --> 02:08:43.281]  I just encourage people to go do their own research.
[02:08:43.641 --> 02:08:52.871]  I think Israel is a powerful, rich country that has a lot of people around the world that support it, and I just see it as one more of these big modern Western states.
[02:08:52.891 --> 02:09:02.361]  Whenever I try to bring up China, a billion and a half people, ethno-state, trying to take over, three million Uyghurs in camps.
[02:09:03.442 --> 02:09:04.443]  Millions of their people killed.
[02:09:04.463 --> 02:09:06.045]  It's like, no, no, no, no.
[02:09:06.065 --> 02:09:06.906]  1,500 Palestinians or 15,000.
[02:09:07.967 --> 02:09:09.689]  And I care about that, too.
[02:09:09.729 --> 02:09:15.214]  So let's spend half the time on the 15,000 Palestinians and half the time on the Chinese being murdered.
[02:09:15.235 --> 02:09:16.436]  But it's like, no, no.
[02:09:16.916 --> 02:09:17.817]  It's like Israel.
[02:09:17.897 --> 02:09:18.198]  And I don't.
[02:09:19.168 --> 02:09:23.533]  It is spiritual, though, because there's this obsession with Israel.
[02:09:23.573 --> 02:09:34.563]  I mean, when I had Kanye West in here for four hours, I said, hey, let's just spend another hour worshiping Hitler, and then we move on to other subjects, like your schools or what you think about music.
[02:09:34.583 --> 02:09:34.623]  No.
[02:09:35.324 --> 02:09:36.465]  He just was like, I'm on air.
[02:09:36.485 --> 02:09:37.326]  You're not stopping me.
[02:09:37.366 --> 02:09:39.068]  Jews, Jews, Jews, Jews, Jews.
[02:09:39.528 --> 02:09:41.870]  And I'm like, okay, well, we've spent now three hours on Jews.
[02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:49.795]  It's like, you're a... I mean, do I just go Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, 24 hours a day, no sleep, or I'm a sellout?
[02:09:50.075 --> 02:09:52.196]  Do I just constantly obsess on Jews?
[02:09:52.937 --> 02:09:54.718]  Just like Jews, Jews, Jews, Jews.
[02:09:55.298 --> 02:09:57.620]  Because I want to be a good person.
[02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:03.161]  All I'm saying is I see a lot of other forces in the world, and then I look at Jews and I see a whole bunch of groups.
[02:10:03.181 --> 02:10:13.844]  You got all these Orthodox Jews that don't think Israel should exist, and like 60 plus percent don't like Netanyahu, they're in a civil war, and then there's a setup, and they know it's an attack, and all this blows up.
[02:10:14.224 --> 02:10:22.246]  I just see Israel being used as an aircraft carrier in the Middle East, and just like Ukraine, a money laundering operation for the Defense Department.
[02:10:22.366 --> 02:10:23.246]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:23.506 --> 02:10:25.266]  Israel, you basically nailed it down.
[02:10:25.286 --> 02:10:31.847]   Israel is The front lines for the military-industrial complex.
[02:10:32.407 --> 02:10:39.558]  Because any single cent, any penny, any dime that's asked for to go and support this secular nation-state, our greatest ally!
[02:10:40.930 --> 02:10:45.052]  We'll be unquestionably, unquestionably, you're not allowed to question it, we'll just admit it.
[02:10:45.072 --> 02:10:46.173]  So let me ask you, so what do we do?
[02:10:46.213 --> 02:10:49.014]  If you were God, what would you do to Israel?
[02:10:49.094 --> 02:10:51.455]  I mean, we could sit here talking about Israel all day.
[02:10:51.555 --> 02:10:52.296]  Oh, we don't have to.
[02:10:52.356 --> 02:10:53.336]  God already, He already said.
[02:10:53.376 --> 02:10:54.477]  No, no, no, no, just tell me.
[02:10:54.757 --> 02:10:55.538]  I don't know, we're here.
[02:10:55.898 --> 02:10:57.879]  Just, I mean, I just don't, I'm sorry.
[02:10:59.073 --> 02:11:02.715]  There are a lot of Americans that are obsessed with Israel, a lot of evangelicals that worship it.
[02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:03.955]  I think that's sick.
[02:11:04.115 --> 02:11:05.536]  I don't worship Israel.
[02:11:05.956 --> 02:11:07.977]  I also don't have a heart on against Israel.
[02:11:08.597 --> 02:11:10.778]  So I see the sophistication of things.
[02:11:10.798 --> 02:11:12.819]  Maybe I'm blind spiritually.
[02:11:13.319 --> 02:11:13.879]  What do we do?
[02:11:14.019 --> 02:11:15.760]  If you're God, what do we do to Israel right now?
[02:11:16.721 --> 02:11:19.522]  Well, first of all, I mean, we need to stop funding their wars.
[02:11:20.543 --> 02:11:24.869]  We need to stop helping them, assisting them in what appears to be an ethnic cleansing happening.
[02:11:24.889 --> 02:11:26.871]  Well, I mean, I agree with Senator Paul and everybody.
[02:11:26.952 --> 02:11:28.714]  I don't want to submit to Ukraine, Israel, anybody.
[02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:35.383]  Congressman Massey is really the only one that's really actually speaking the truth about any of this, and I'm glad that he is.
[02:11:37.662 --> 02:11:41.424]  He's probably the only truly America First representative that we have in our fake government right now.
[02:11:42.204 --> 02:11:43.104]  What about elections?
[02:11:43.784 --> 02:11:45.925]  What about the, what about the interference in our elections?
[02:11:46.145 --> 02:11:47.926]  Are we, are we going to vote our way out of this?
[02:11:48.526 --> 02:11:53.508]  Are we going to just pretend like 2024 Trump takes over and then we don't have any more problems?
[02:11:53.789 --> 02:11:54.689]  You like Trump, right?
[02:11:55.737 --> 02:11:59.058]  I like the 2015 going into 2016 America First Trump.
[02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:02.299]  Okay, but I mean, his daughter's married to a Jew.
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:02.900]  That's right.
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:04.940]  He did more for Israel than... I don't like that.
[02:12:05.281 --> 02:12:06.101]  But why not?
[02:12:06.221 --> 02:12:07.942]  He went and got the Abraham Accords for peace.
[02:12:08.402 --> 02:12:10.583]  I don't... Wouldn't it be good if they all just live in peace?
[02:12:11.263 --> 02:12:16.245]  Didn't Donald Trump just basically surround himself with the entire deep state that he swore that he was going to go up against?
[02:12:16.265 --> 02:12:17.905]  Okay, well I just said why he's supporting Trump.
[02:12:17.925 --> 02:12:18.866]  He was trying to fix it.
[02:12:19.006 --> 02:12:19.906]  I'm not supporting Trump.
[02:12:20.086 --> 02:12:24.010]  I don't support any... I think every political candidate... You think Trump's bad?
[02:12:24.070 --> 02:12:25.912]  It's a non-conversation... Is Trump a Jewish agent?
[02:12:26.833 --> 02:12:27.193]  I don't know.
[02:12:27.734 --> 02:12:28.074]  I don't know.
[02:12:28.875 --> 02:12:31.458]  But what I do know is that talking about any candidate is foolish.
[02:12:31.998 --> 02:12:32.919]  What are we going to do?
[02:12:33.019 --> 02:12:35.622]  Why should we engage with Israel and try to fix this?
[02:12:36.403 --> 02:12:36.943]  I think we should.
[02:12:36.963 --> 02:12:42.209]  I mean, Benjamin Netanyahu is the de facto president of the United States, if you want to just keep it real.
[02:12:43.410 --> 02:12:44.271]  He's calling the shots.
[02:12:44.351 --> 02:12:55.324]  And as a matter of fact, there's videos of him saying it doesn't matter what the American people feel about Israel, it doesn't matter what the American government feels about Israel, because we have them so programmed that they will do anything for Israel.
[02:12:55.364 --> 02:12:57.367]  We can do whatever we want and get away with it.
[02:12:57.467 --> 02:12:59.910]  He has said that himself on tape.
[02:13:01.257 --> 02:13:07.922]  And if that kind of control and power structure exists... Hey, I've seen that written, but I haven't quite seen that video.
[02:13:07.942 --> 02:13:08.943]  Tell us where we see that video.
[02:13:08.983 --> 02:13:09.423]  What's the name of it?
[02:13:09.443 --> 02:13:11.285]  I don't know what the name of the video is.
[02:13:11.385 --> 02:13:16.568]  Alex could probably pull it up and send it to you, but we've aired it on... You've got a producer named Alex?
[02:13:16.769 --> 02:13:18.850]  Yeah, he's like my right hand.
[02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:19.711]  Alex, could you give us that?
[02:13:21.061 --> 02:13:22.542]  We'll play it.
[02:13:22.622 --> 02:13:23.122]  We'll play it.
[02:13:23.142 --> 02:13:32.767]  But if we have that kind of control structure and power over our entire operating system of our country... So if you had a magic wand, get rid of the top of the Jews?
[02:13:32.847 --> 02:13:33.968]  Or just get rid of all of them?
[02:13:33.988 --> 02:13:35.569]  You've got a magic wand.
[02:13:35.989 --> 02:13:44.713]  The satanic, non-practicing, fake Jews, the Khazars, the Zionists, who are infiltrating free governments across the face of the planet.
[02:13:45.294 --> 02:13:47.755]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:13:47.875 --> 02:13:48.996]  I'm not anti-Jew.
[02:13:49.736 --> 02:13:51.077]  I don't like the leftists and all that.
[02:13:51.217 --> 02:13:56.742]  Elon Musk said, hey, why do the leftist Jews want to bring in a bunch of people and teach people that, hey, white people, don't yell while you're being attacked.
[02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:57.402]  They call it anti-Semitic.
[02:13:57.442 --> 02:13:58.783]  No, I'm just being honest.
[02:13:59.844 --> 02:14:06.129]  I mean, I just never... I mean, because I find humans act the same across the board.
[02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:07.690]  They have smart elites, corrupt governments.
[02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:08.771]  They all try the same tactics.
[02:14:09.171 --> 02:14:12.374]  I see Israel, whoever runs it, at any one time doing scams.
[02:14:12.734 --> 02:14:14.816]  So I see that the Jews are mad about it in Israel.
[02:14:17.613 --> 02:14:22.738]  You're just saying, in the world, because all I'm getting is, from you or Kanye West, is Jews.
[02:14:22.818 --> 02:14:26.061]  I mean, like, if you just don't care them, then the trains run on time.
[02:14:26.121 --> 02:14:26.822]  I mean, what happens?
[02:14:29.133 --> 02:14:42.316]  If we get rid of a power structure from any government that's outside of the United States that has infiltrated our government and steals money from the American taxpayer to kill innocent people, any of those governments, who is doing this?
[02:14:43.516 --> 02:14:44.416]  Who is funding this?
[02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:52.857]  When you look at the media and you look at AIPAC and the ADL and the power that they have inside of our government, you can't deny that.
[02:14:52.978 --> 02:14:55.058]  They own the military-industrial complex.
[02:14:55.925 --> 02:14:57.427]  So, is it the only problem?
[02:14:57.587 --> 02:14:58.488]  No, I'm not saying that.
[02:14:58.828 --> 02:15:00.149]  It is the biggest problem.
[02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:01.871]  It is the most imminent problem.
[02:15:02.111 --> 02:15:07.497]  Well, just because America supports Israel, are you saying the military industrial complex is run by Israel?
[02:15:07.857 --> 02:15:08.057]  Yes.
[02:15:08.958 --> 02:15:09.699]  What's the proof of that?
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:16.283]   I'm saying that the Zionist Khazars These people, what is the proof of it?
[02:15:16.963 --> 02:15:22.166]  Well, go look at, as again, I will say, Biden's cabinet, the State Department, Victoria Nuland.
[02:15:22.686 --> 02:15:26.568]  Who is making the decisions to go and bomb these people when Congress hasn't even declared war?
[02:15:26.968 --> 02:15:41.175]  If we can really fund a government, if we can really send hundreds of billions of dollars, military equipment, military aid, put boots on the ground in a country without our Congress declaring war, where are we as a country?
[02:15:41.215 --> 02:15:42.695]  Well, Congress did that in Vietnam.
[02:15:42.735 --> 02:15:43.436]  Was that the Jews too?
[02:15:45.655 --> 02:15:46.956]  I'm not as well versed on Vietnam.
[02:15:47.656 --> 02:15:48.117]  Or Korea.
[02:15:48.137 --> 02:15:49.137]  There was no declaration of war.
[02:15:49.157 --> 02:15:50.658]  I can see what's happening in the world right now.
[02:15:51.279 --> 02:15:53.040]  We are killing millions of people.
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:55.742]  The United States government is probably the most corrupt government.
[02:15:55.862 --> 02:15:56.502]  Forget Ukraine.
[02:15:57.083 --> 02:15:59.444]  We are probably the most corrupt government on the face of the planet.
[02:15:59.984 --> 02:16:00.665]  I would agree with that.
[02:16:02.566 --> 02:16:09.831]  And at the heart of the CIA, at the heart of the intelligence operation, at the heart of the DOJ, the FBI is imprisoning people like Owen.
[02:16:12.102 --> 02:16:14.144]  Innocent people who are being taken away from their family.
[02:16:14.164 --> 02:16:17.646]  When he was on the show yesterday, he was talking about all the people that he spent that time in prison with.
[02:16:17.666 --> 02:16:35.000]  These are men who have been separated from their families, and the people that are putting them in prison, who no doubt, inevitably, will come after me, and come after you, and then they're going to come after everyone that supports or stands behind the people who have been willing to stand up for the truth, and say the truth, unfetteringly, not caring who came after them.
[02:16:35.945 --> 02:16:36.565]  They're next.
[02:16:37.406 --> 02:16:45.649]  And if these people don't understand that, if they're still stuck on Fox or stuck on CNN or busy doing your everyday life, they are coming after you.
[02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:48.270]  Let's get down to brass tacks here.
[02:16:50.571 --> 02:16:52.452]  Hitler thought the main problem was the Jews.
[02:16:52.512 --> 02:16:53.532]  Do you agree with that, Al Fitler?
[02:16:53.552 --> 02:16:55.473]  It's a real question.
[02:16:59.474 --> 02:17:00.675]  Yeah, I mean, look.
[02:17:04.321 --> 02:17:06.583]  I don't agree with senselessly murdering or killing anybody.
[02:17:09.305 --> 02:17:10.787]  I don't agree with ruthless dictators.
[02:17:11.587 --> 02:17:13.129]  Do I agree with everything Vladimir Putin does?
[02:17:13.189 --> 02:17:13.789]  No, of course not.
[02:17:13.809 --> 02:17:15.991]  I mean, could he be a ruthless dictator killing innocent people?
[02:17:16.031 --> 02:17:16.511]  Of course not.
[02:17:16.531 --> 02:17:17.993]  Yeah, well, Hitler killed more Russians than anybody.
[02:17:18.013 --> 02:17:19.634]  He killed 28 million of them.
[02:17:19.654 --> 02:17:20.995]  I mean, do I support that?
[02:17:21.075 --> 02:17:21.776]  No, of course not.
[02:17:22.577 --> 02:17:32.305]  But I'm able to objectively still agree with a lot of the things that Vladimir Putin is doing, that we have proof of, without being propagandized.
[02:17:33.522 --> 02:17:34.042]  I can watch.
[02:17:34.503 --> 02:17:38.105]  When the media tells me to do something, if I run the opposite direction, I normally find the truth.
[02:17:39.286 --> 02:17:42.948]  Why the incessant push to villainize Vladimir Putin and label him a war criminal?
[02:17:43.508 --> 02:17:45.049]  My question was about Adolf Hitler.
[02:17:46.317 --> 02:17:47.397]  No, I'm not a Hitler supporter.
[02:17:47.417 --> 02:17:48.117]  Well, that's good.
[02:17:48.157 --> 02:17:48.597]  I'm not either.
[02:17:49.078 --> 02:17:52.318]  What I'm saying is, you know about the Russian Revolution, right?
[02:17:52.338 --> 02:17:52.798]  Of course.
[02:17:53.419 --> 02:17:56.679]  And I'd say half the Russian Revolution at the top was Jewish.
[02:17:57.139 --> 02:17:57.239]  V.I.
[02:17:57.399 --> 02:17:58.280]  Lenin, that they were atheists.
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:04.421]  You know Stalin then double-crossed and basically poisoned Lenin and then kicked the Jewish leadership of the Communist out.
[02:18:04.441 --> 02:18:05.361]  That was the Trotskyites.
[02:18:06.021 --> 02:18:09.782]  And then developed these arbitrary borders where ethnic Russians just had to resettle.
[02:18:11.172 --> 02:18:12.955]  Yeah, you're talking about Lenin.
[02:18:12.975 --> 02:18:13.075]  Yeah.
[02:18:13.115 --> 02:18:16.700]  But what I'm saying is, though there is, some of that stuff's going on there.
[02:18:17.702 --> 02:18:25.519]   I'm just simply saying that then Hitler killed, even though Lenin was gone, And Jews weren't running Russia.
[02:18:25.539 --> 02:18:27.560]  Hitler killed 26, 28 million Russians.
[02:18:28.481 --> 02:18:36.386]  So when I bring up Hitler, you bring up Putin, I'm just saying that this is, just because there's some bad Jews doesn't mean that Hitler's good.
[02:18:36.726 --> 02:18:40.128]  And I'm not saying you're saying that, but I mean it's... No, I'm not saying Hitler's good.
[02:18:40.148 --> 02:18:41.389]  Like Biden's a horrible person.
[02:18:41.409 --> 02:18:42.570]  We don't blame the Irish for that.
[02:18:44.568 --> 02:18:47.070]  I'm not saying Hitler is good and I'm not saying that Jews are bad.
[02:18:48.091 --> 02:18:56.019]  I'm saying that we have a secular nation state that has infiltrated every single level of every federal bureaucracy in our government.
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:59.182]  That is making policy decisions.
[02:18:59.823 --> 02:19:01.625]  That is making military decisions.
[02:19:02.642 --> 02:19:04.403]  That is sucking the taxpayer dry.
[02:19:04.783 --> 02:19:05.824]  Well, I'll agree with you on this.
[02:19:06.885 --> 02:19:08.466]  We won World War II and defeated Hitler.
[02:19:08.486 --> 02:19:11.708]  Both my grandfathers in the Army, Air Corps, and both almost died, so I almost don't exist because of it.
[02:19:12.368 --> 02:19:14.529]  And it is weird with the liberals, the left, the ADL.
[02:19:15.090 --> 02:19:24.415]  They have literally made American conservatives, we're Hitler now, and we have to agree with drag queen story time and open borders and critical race theory and white people are bad, or we're Hitler.
[02:19:25.436 --> 02:19:26.837]  I find that very, very offensive.
[02:19:28.338 --> 02:19:29.939]  White males are the biggest threat.
[02:19:31.465 --> 02:19:32.445]  To our national security.
[02:19:33.526 --> 02:19:34.166]  We're told that.
[02:19:34.926 --> 02:19:42.528]  White Christian males are a bigger threat than the CIA created ISIS, than the Israel created Hamas.
[02:19:42.548 --> 02:19:43.909]  Remember, Israel created Hamas.
[02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:47.490]  And I know we've talked about this before.
[02:19:48.797 --> 02:19:52.118]  But this is supposed to be one of the most fortified borders on the face of the planet.
[02:19:52.138 --> 02:19:55.940]  Well see, that's how I would criticize the leadership of Israel, not Jews in general.
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.400]  Who stood down?
[02:19:57.640 --> 02:19:58.361]  It's confirmed.
[02:19:58.541 --> 02:19:59.321]  Why'd they do it?
[02:19:59.681 --> 02:20:00.842]  Why'd they found Hamas?
[02:20:01.002 --> 02:20:02.362]  Yeah, yeah, now you're talking.
[02:20:02.742 --> 02:20:04.563]  And why did Biden give Iran money before this happened?
[02:20:04.783 --> 02:20:06.044]  It's a lot more sophisticated.
[02:20:08.058 --> 02:20:11.739]  If they formed and funded Hamas, at the end of the day, who did that?
[02:20:12.319 --> 02:20:13.679]  Where does all of the money come from?
[02:20:13.719 --> 02:20:15.420]  You say that Israel is a super-rich nation.
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:16.240]  Where does it come from?
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:17.500]  Who gives it to them?
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:18.561]  How do they earn it?
[02:20:19.001 --> 02:20:21.341]  Have they ever fought alongside of us in one single war?
[02:20:21.361 --> 02:20:22.201]  Nope, they haven't.
[02:20:22.441 --> 02:20:23.542]  Have they killed Americans?
[02:20:23.742 --> 02:20:24.302]  Yep, they have.
[02:20:24.562 --> 02:20:26.562]  Have they carried out war crimes against America?
[02:20:26.723 --> 02:20:27.323]  Yep, they have.
[02:20:27.783 --> 02:20:29.343]  Why are they our greatest ally?
[02:20:30.223 --> 02:20:33.124]  Why can't I ask that question without being an anti-Semitic Jew-hater?
[02:20:33.524 --> 02:20:36.045]  Well, somehow, Hitler was projected on America.
[02:20:36.085 --> 02:20:36.665]  We're Hitler now.
[02:20:38.311 --> 02:20:39.192]  Our government is Hitler?
[02:20:39.472 --> 02:20:39.832]  No, no, no.
[02:20:40.332 --> 02:20:43.114]  After World War II, the ADL now has taught us America is Hitler.
[02:20:43.414 --> 02:20:45.275]  We must do what the ADL says or we are Hitler.
[02:20:45.455 --> 02:20:46.896]  I don't necessarily disagree with that point.
[02:20:49.292 --> 02:20:49.933]  Explain that to me.
[02:20:50.013 --> 02:20:51.274]  Our government is just as murderous.
[02:20:51.734 --> 02:20:56.218]  How many millions of... No, but I'm saying the ADL says Christians and white people are Hitler.
[02:20:56.638 --> 02:20:58.680]  Do what they say or we'll call you Hitler.
[02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:00.462]  So I don't like what the ADL does.
[02:21:00.522 --> 02:21:01.162]  I can't stand them.
[02:21:01.563 --> 02:21:07.027]  I'm just saying the ADL is like a leftist globalist brainwashing operation.
[02:21:07.468 --> 02:21:12.872]  I don't then... Like if a black guy mugs me today, I don't then see black people and think, oh, they're going to mug me.
[02:21:13.273 --> 02:21:15.935]  Or if a white guy mugs me, I don't think a white guy... white people did it.
[02:21:16.035 --> 02:21:20.877]  But objectively, you have to sit back and look at the percentage of violent crime that's committed by young black males.
[02:21:20.958 --> 02:21:22.878]  And then you have to be able to honestly talk about it.
[02:21:22.898 --> 02:21:28.481]  Sure, but what I'm saying is, I'm happy to criticize any government and any power structure or mafia.
[02:21:29.702 --> 02:21:33.084]  But we know the Italians had a lot of mafia in this country.
[02:21:33.104 --> 02:21:37.906]  We don't blame people with an Italian last name because there was a big Italian mafia.
[02:21:37.986 --> 02:21:38.947]  That's where I'm going with this.
[02:21:40.007 --> 02:21:43.269]  Again, I'm not naming the Jew as being the bad guy.
[02:21:44.915 --> 02:21:48.433]  I am merely pointing out that at every level of our bureaucracy...
[02:21:49.397 --> 02:21:51.378]  That we swear an allegiance to this nation state.
[02:21:51.438 --> 02:21:53.720]  That we send hundreds of billions of dollars without question.
[02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:56.141]  That we bomb people on behalf of this country.
[02:21:56.161 --> 02:21:58.022]  That we'll protect their borders and not protect ours.
[02:21:58.042 --> 02:22:00.143]  That our media is 100% funded by these people.
[02:22:00.544 --> 02:22:04.626]  Our media, our criminal media, forced people to die and is still forcing people to die every day.
[02:22:05.186 --> 02:22:14.312]  Our media is normalizing... Okay, but then again, and then the big universities agree with you, 90%, the presidents won't even... So how do you get...
[02:22:17.875 --> 02:22:20.236]  Because you know those presidents are put in there to say what they're told.
[02:22:21.137 --> 02:22:21.817]  Counter-narratives.
[02:22:23.638 --> 02:22:24.498]  Counter-narratives.
[02:22:24.738 --> 02:22:25.098]  Of course.
[02:22:25.899 --> 02:22:27.119]  What is Fox and CNN?
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:29.180]  Same ownership.
[02:22:29.260 --> 02:22:35.523]  So you're saying the Israel lobby is using leftist idiots to make any anti-Israel thing look discredited?
[02:22:35.843 --> 02:22:36.184]  Of course.
[02:22:37.244 --> 02:22:38.365]  That's a legitimate point.
[02:22:38.685 --> 02:22:40.165]  I'm asking you the questions to answer them.
[02:22:40.546 --> 02:22:43.447]  I'm not answering them to say you're wrong.
[02:22:43.827 --> 02:22:45.188]  I think we should be able to discuss this.
[02:22:45.868 --> 02:22:48.029]  Because we've all been called Hitler, we're pro-free speech.
[02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:49.110]  Elon Musk has been called Hitler.
[02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:50.291]  He's certainly not anti-Israel.
[02:22:50.711 --> 02:22:58.316]  So I think it's important to have, I mean, if you can have MSNBC say white people are inherently evil because of the right color of their skin, they've opened the door to all this discussion.
[02:22:59.097 --> 02:23:01.438]  And now I see a lot of the pro-Israel lobbies not liking this.
[02:23:01.458 --> 02:23:02.499]  They're like, wait, wait, wait.
[02:23:02.519 --> 02:23:04.080]  We were teaching white people are inherently bad.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:05.221]  Don't say we're bad.
[02:23:05.241 --> 02:23:08.103]  The head of the ADL said, listen, we're just saying white people are bad.
[02:23:08.603 --> 02:23:11.605]  But now you put Jews at the bottom of the barrel, the worst, the white people.
[02:23:11.645 --> 02:23:17.404]   know white people are bad we're good that's a very racist evil person
[02:23:16.988 --> 02:23:18.629]  How do we mobilize the American people?
[02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:23.110]  You know... How do we stop them from killing us?
[02:23:23.170 --> 02:23:27.131]  How do we stop them from having unfettered, unquestioned sexual access to our children?
[02:23:27.891 --> 02:23:31.732]  How do we stop them from forcing injections into our children and into us?
[02:23:32.032 --> 02:23:34.433]  Why do we... Are you saying that's Jews doing that?
[02:23:35.543 --> 02:23:39.745]  No, I'm saying, how does the American people... Well, what I'm saying is, Israel got some of the most poisoned shots.
[02:23:40.085 --> 02:23:41.385]  They have some of the highest death toll.
[02:23:41.726 --> 02:23:49.369]  So if the Jews are the magic, you know, pup, the magic dragon, why were they hit with shots as bad as any country probably... Because those are practicing Jews.
[02:23:50.249 --> 02:23:57.192]  The people of Israel, the practicing Jews, got that poison from the satanic, fake, non-practicing Khazars.
[02:23:57.972 --> 02:24:04.296]  that call themselves Jews to prevent you from being able to criticize them or their government to allow them to continue to rip it off.
[02:24:04.316 --> 02:24:05.297]  That was a lethal injection.
[02:24:05.337 --> 02:24:07.038]  We know here it was directed at conservatives.
[02:24:08.507 --> 02:24:09.107]  You've seen the numbers?
[02:24:09.268 --> 02:24:10.028]  Yeah, I've seen the numbers.
[02:24:10.068 --> 02:24:12.470]  They said hot lots into the most conservative areas.
[02:24:12.490 --> 02:24:13.731]  Yeah, we did a big thing on that.
[02:24:14.931 --> 02:24:16.993]  How bad is my shot or whatever it is, dot com.
[02:24:17.253 --> 02:24:22.136]  You can go look and see if you got the serum, if you got the... Alright, well I didn't censor you.
[02:24:22.436 --> 02:24:23.937]  I thought we'd talk about the election.
[02:24:24.218 --> 02:24:24.638]  I want to.
[02:24:24.798 --> 02:24:32.063]  And all this, and we just spent 50 minutes on juice, so... You want to do four hours like Kanye West?
[02:24:33.444 --> 02:24:34.825]  No.
[02:24:34.865 --> 02:24:36.166]  It's so magic to say it, it's like...
[02:24:37.313 --> 02:24:40.255]  This is, this is, this is why I wanted to start talking about elections.
[02:24:40.275 --> 02:24:41.236]  Are we going to vote our way out of this?
[02:24:41.276 --> 02:24:42.537]  How do you mobilize the American people?
[02:24:42.577 --> 02:24:47.220]  Are we really going to pretend that the 2020 election... Yeah, well, I mean, what do you think of Trump's indictments?
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:48.221]  What do you think of the open borders?
[02:24:48.241 --> 02:24:49.362]  What do you think of the Ukraine war?
[02:24:49.682 --> 02:24:53.725]  What do you think of Zelensky saying, stop crying Americans, no roads for you, give me all your money?
[02:24:53.745 --> 02:24:54.325]  He actually said that.
[02:24:54.665 --> 02:24:54.805]  Yeah.
[02:24:55.026 --> 02:24:55.786]  Did you see that clip?
[02:24:55.866 --> 02:24:59.048]  And who is... You don't get roads, give me all your money!
[02:24:59.249 --> 02:24:59.989]  Who is Zelensky?
[02:25:00.269 --> 02:25:00.850]  Who put him there?
[02:25:03.151 --> 02:25:03.452]  We did.
[02:25:04.072 --> 02:25:06.614]  The totally compromised guy that plays pianos with his wing-wing.
[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:11.443]  He just bought yesterday, by the way, a $22 million mansion in Florida.
[02:25:11.763 --> 02:25:11.943]  Yep.
[02:25:14.085 --> 02:25:19.190]  This is where our money is going, and then the media gins up the hype.
[02:25:19.831 --> 02:25:21.492]  Oh, Toby Keith, let's write a song.
[02:25:21.893 --> 02:25:24.235]  We'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.
[02:25:24.315 --> 02:25:27.398]  Don't screw with us, or we'll bomb you and turn you into glass.
[02:25:27.958 --> 02:25:29.219]  This is what we're doing.
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:33.724]  And then they bring the Muslims in, who then are pissed and attack us, and then the TSA grabs our children's genitals.
[02:25:35.424 --> 02:25:36.365]  That's a dialectic.
[02:25:37.466 --> 02:25:38.567]  We've got to go to break in two minutes.
[02:25:41.689 --> 02:25:43.491]  You know what I want to talk about?
[02:25:44.332 --> 02:25:44.632]  Listen.
[02:25:44.892 --> 02:25:46.033]  Mobilizing Americans.
[02:25:46.574 --> 02:25:47.574]  We have to take our guns.
[02:25:47.594 --> 02:25:49.076]  We're in the middle of World War III.
[02:25:49.116 --> 02:25:51.097]  And are Jews welcome to join you in the fight against the new world?
[02:25:51.117 --> 02:25:51.258]  Sure.
[02:25:51.318 --> 02:25:51.518]  Yeah.
[02:25:51.578 --> 02:25:51.838]  Pick up.
[02:25:51.918 --> 02:25:52.258]  Yeah.
[02:25:52.338 --> 02:25:52.819]  Absolutely.
[02:25:53.439 --> 02:25:53.660]  Yes.
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:55.922]  Real Jews or fake Khazars that want to kill us?
[02:25:57.583 --> 02:25:57.743]  Yeah.
[02:25:57.903 --> 02:25:58.584]  Practicing Jews?
[02:25:58.644 --> 02:25:58.924]  Of course.
[02:25:58.944 --> 02:26:00.766]  I thought we were done on the Jews.
[02:26:01.403 --> 02:26:02.545]  No, we're not going to stop now.
[02:26:03.045 --> 02:26:03.806]  But I will tell you this.
[02:26:03.866 --> 02:26:05.608]  I'm going to do a 48-hour marathon.
[02:26:06.169 --> 02:26:10.374]  If you want to know the truth, military interventions are killing innocent people across the planet.
[02:26:10.675 --> 02:26:16.221]  The only intervention that I believe that we should support right now is when the American people rise up and intervene against this government.
[02:26:16.662 --> 02:26:17.223]  Our government.
[02:26:17.643 --> 02:26:19.706]  Well, you're not talking about offensive violence, though.
[02:26:22.369 --> 02:26:24.230]  The answer to 1984 is likely 1776.
[02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:27.852]  And then you want to list the military.
[02:26:27.892 --> 02:26:30.654]  The thing is, it's an information war, though.
[02:26:30.794 --> 02:26:33.435]  So when I say war, I mean the war of ideas.
[02:26:34.676 --> 02:26:35.817]  I think they want violence.
[02:26:35.857 --> 02:26:37.198]  I think that's the worst possible thing.
[02:26:37.278 --> 02:26:37.518]  They do.
[02:26:38.806 --> 02:26:39.066]  Okay.
[02:26:39.166 --> 02:26:42.387]  Because they want a justification to be able to kill us in the street without question.
[02:26:42.628 --> 02:26:42.948]  All right.
[02:26:43.068 --> 02:26:44.268]  Stu Peters is our guest.
[02:26:44.568 --> 02:26:45.429]  He wanted to come to town.
[02:26:45.449 --> 02:26:49.670]  I've interviewed him for a show, and I'm having Kanye West flashbacks about saying you're baby Hitler.
[02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:52.792]  But the point is, we're here.
[02:26:52.812 --> 02:26:55.153]  The war room's coming up in about an hour and...
[02:26:56.193 --> 02:26:58.934]  Six minutes, five minutes from now, Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.

[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:22.440]  I'm not politically correct.
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:25.501]  I believe in people's free speech, folks, so it's a good exercise we're having.
[02:27:25.521 --> 02:27:28.403]  But I just do not have the myopic view that Israel is the center of the universe.
[02:27:28.423 --> 02:27:30.203]  That's where I differ from the Zionists and Stupiders.
[02:27:30.223 --> 02:27:31.104]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:30.943 --> 02:27:38.782]   store.com or 888-253-3139. I'm not politically correct. I believe people's free speech, folks,
[02:27:38.782 --> 02:27:43.782]   so it's a good exercise we're having. But I just do not have the myopic view that Israel's
[02:27:43.782 --> 02:27:47.983]   the center of the universe. That's where I differ from the Zionists and Stupiders. We'll

[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:13.182]  I think we can all agree that this new video game from Alex Jones looks fantastic.
[02:28:13.544 --> 02:28:15.206]  God, this is so well made.
[02:28:15.286 --> 02:28:16.427]  This is absolutely genius.
[02:28:16.667 --> 02:28:19.490]  I went online, bought it, played it, and it's fun as hell.
[02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:20.731]  That's crazy.
[02:28:20.811 --> 02:28:21.672]  This is awesome.
[02:28:21.972 --> 02:28:22.453]  Holy shit!
[02:28:22.993 --> 02:28:23.454]  I love it.
[02:28:23.494 --> 02:28:24.655]  The game is amazing.
[02:28:24.715 --> 02:28:33.604]  You can purchase the game right here on AlexJonesGame.com AlexJonesGame.com Just in time for Christmas, it's the Alex Jones video game.
[02:28:34.084 --> 02:28:36.627]  I can't believe how hilarious and fun this looks.
[02:28:36.847 --> 02:28:39.948]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[02:28:40.128 --> 02:28:41.229]  I'm definitely gonna play it.
[02:28:41.309 --> 02:28:41.989]  I'm gonna buy it.
[02:28:42.029 --> 02:28:42.829]  Check the game out.
[02:28:42.969 --> 02:28:43.449]  It's epic.
[02:28:43.509 --> 02:28:44.750]  It's a conversation starter.
[02:28:44.770 --> 02:28:46.150]  It's definitely funny as hell.
[02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:48.231]  Defeat Big Tech Cucks?
[02:28:50.772 --> 02:28:51.612]  No way!
[02:28:51.632 --> 02:28:52.652]  Oh, I destroyed him!
[02:28:52.692 --> 02:28:53.052]  I beat him!
[02:28:53.152 --> 02:28:55.233]  I thought you did computers, leptard.
[02:28:56.173 --> 02:28:59.454]  Is it too late for an entry into Jeff Keighley's Game Awards?
[02:28:59.955 --> 02:29:00.795]  I'm buying the game.
[02:29:03.311 --> 02:29:04.034]  Game of the Year?
[02:29:04.476 --> 02:29:07.076]  Clearly, I mean, clearly.
[02:29:07.076 --> 02:29:23.835]   Former Italian health minister Roberto Sporanza is under investigation for homicide after emails reveal that from
[02:29:23.835 --> 02:29:27.116]   the very start of the vaccinations, he knew the shots were
[02:29:27.116 --> 02:29:31.116]   killing people and gave orders to local health authorities to
[02:29:31.116 --> 02:29:35.236]   conceal deaths and serious side effects in order to reassure
[02:29:35.236 --> 02:29:39.076]   Italian citizens of their safety and to not jeopardize the
[02:29:39.076 --> 02:29:40.595]   vaccination campaign.
[02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:44.981]  The story has been reported on both German and Italian news networks.
[02:29:45.661 --> 02:29:47.863]  I will now provide an English translation.
[02:29:49.124 --> 02:29:58.450]  The Rome Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating Roberto Speranza, the Italian government's health minister, during the time of COVID measures.
[02:29:58.931 --> 02:30:01.553]  He was responsible for the vaccination campaign.
[02:30:02.113 --> 02:30:09.639]  The investigations are the result of complaints related to the so-called AIFA emails from the Italian Medicines Agency.
[02:30:10.259 --> 02:30:15.502]  The former director of AIFA, Nicola Magrini, is also under investigation.
[02:30:16.082 --> 02:30:23.946]  The publication of these internal emails revealed that they had been aware of the dangers of the COVID vaccination from the start.
[02:30:24.507 --> 02:30:35.393]  The accusation is that the responsible minister and the head of the drug authority knowingly and deliberately exposed the unsuspecting Italian population to this risk.
[02:30:36.013 --> 02:30:39.396]  Yes, they encouraged Italians to get vaccinated.
[02:30:39.897 --> 02:30:43.761]  Vaccination was even made mandatory for certain professional groups.
[02:30:44.241 --> 02:30:48.806]  Consequently, many side effects, including fatal ones, came to light.
[02:30:49.266 --> 02:31:12.505]   The investigations are for murder, serious bodily harm, and more, because Speranza and Magrini evidently gave instructions to the local health authorities To conceal the deaths and serious side effects that occurred immediately after the vaccinations began, in order not to jeopardize the vaccination campaign and to reassure the citizens about their safety.
[02:31:13.066 --> 02:31:18.369]  The responsible minister and the head of AIFA are now expected to answer for these actions.
[02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:26.435]  According to the complaints from the police unions and the financial police, as well as from the private organization, listen to me.
[02:31:26.795 --> 02:31:30.680]  Which represents 4,200 people damaged by vaccines.
[02:31:31.601 --> 02:31:37.267]  In Italy, police officers and teachers were subjected to mandatory COVID vaccination.
[02:31:37.667 --> 02:31:44.635]  Here is the former health minister, Roberto Speranza, proudly announcing vaccination statistics in Italy.
[02:31:45.506 --> 02:31:50.351]  We have now reached a massively significant percentage of vaccinated people in Italy, 89.41%.
[02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:57.630]   89.41 percent. Therefore, currently in Italy, just over 10 percent of the
[02:31:57.630 --> 02:32:03.670]   population remains unvaccinated. Well, today Roberto Speranza is under
[02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:09.470]  investigation for lies he allegedly told about vaccines.
[02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:12.582]  Among the crimes he is accused of are ideological falsehood and murder.
[02:32:13.102 --> 02:32:16.564]  Look, this is the document we are showing you tonight exclusively.
[02:32:17.024 --> 02:32:29.249]   It states the former minister, Roberto Speranza, along with Nicola Magrini, the former general manager of AIFA, Are both registered in the investigative records of the Rome Prosecutor's Office.
[02:32:30.089 --> 02:32:41.031]  Last week, the House of Representatives of the Philippines passed a resolution to investigate over 260,000 unexplained excess deaths in 2021 and 67,000 unexplained excess deaths in 2022.
[02:32:40.890 --> 02:32:45.890]  in 2021 and 67,000 unexplained excess deaths in 2022.
[02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:53.011]  The next day, they were hit by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake.
[02:32:53.011 --> 02:32:56.630]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:32:57.295 --> 02:33:10.295]  [Intro]
[02:33:10.295 --> 02:33:17.295]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:17.295 --> 02:33:20.295]  [Cheering]
[02:33:20.295 --> 02:33:25.295]  [Music]
[02:33:25.295 --> 02:33:27.295]  Info Wars has been banned.
[02:33:27.295 --> 02:33:30.135]   And, (rock music)
[02:33:29.976 --> 02:33:30.296]  Arrested.
[02:33:30.316 --> 02:33:35.261]  Attacked and threatened.
[02:33:36.682 --> 02:33:38.363]  Because we are effective.
[02:33:38.403 --> 02:33:41.486]  The Great Awakening is here.
[02:33:41.806 --> 02:33:43.468]  Go to Banned.Video.
[02:33:44.148 --> 02:33:46.310]  Download the videos and share.

[02:33:57.669 --> 02:34:15.502]  InfoWars.com Alright, popular talk show host Stu Peters is in studio with us one more segment and the great Drew Hernandez takes over.
[02:34:15.702 --> 02:34:16.642]  Always informative.
[02:34:18.023 --> 02:34:19.304]  And then you're going to interview me for your show.
[02:34:19.404 --> 02:34:19.925]  One second there.
[02:34:20.701 --> 02:34:21.701]  Not really quite sure.
[02:34:21.701 --> 02:34:22.701]  All right.
[02:34:22.701 --> 02:34:23.701]  Well, I'm looking forward to that.
[02:34:23.701 --> 02:34:25.701]   I have no idea what we're going to talk about, but I'm sure it's going to be interesting
[02:34:25.701 --> 02:34:26.701]  because none of this is pre-planned.
[02:34:26.701 --> 02:34:27.701]  I love the stuff on the internet.
[02:34:27.701 --> 02:34:28.701]  Like, oh, it's all pre-planned.
[02:34:28.701 --> 02:34:29.701]  It's all this and that.
[02:34:29.701 --> 02:34:30.701]  No, it's not.
[02:34:30.701 --> 02:34:31.701]  We take your calls.
[02:34:31.701 --> 02:34:32.701]  They're real calls.
[02:34:32.701 --> 02:34:33.701]  Guests are real guests.
[02:34:33.701 --> 02:34:34.701]  Come in here and talk about whatever you want.
[02:34:34.701 --> 02:34:35.701]  I believe in that.
[02:34:35.701 --> 02:34:36.701]  I believe in free speech.
[02:34:36.701 --> 02:34:37.701]  I am a free speech absolutist.
[02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:38.701]  I believe in free speech.
[02:34:38.701 --> 02:34:38.701]  I am a free speech absolutist.
[02:34:38.701 --> 02:34:39.701]  Speech.
[02:34:40.052 --> 02:34:43.895]  We're in a lot of radio stations, so we just can't say cuss words over and over again or they get fines.
[02:34:43.935 --> 02:34:46.076]  But other than that, we can basically do whatever we want.
[02:34:46.837 --> 02:34:49.378]  But Stu, we just did an hour on Israel.
[02:34:49.479 --> 02:34:49.739]  Great.
[02:34:49.919 --> 02:34:50.399]  That's there.
[02:34:50.419 --> 02:34:52.781]  People can get what they want from that.
[02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:59.305]  But big picture, cyber attacks imminent, civil war, all these movies about it, the election, Trump, the indictments.
[02:34:59.345 --> 02:35:00.706]  What do you think we're about to see next year?
[02:35:01.266 --> 02:35:02.747]  Well, they're telegraphing everything we're going to see.
[02:35:02.767 --> 02:35:09.353]  I mean, this, you know, Barack and the guy pretending to be Michelle Obama with their new, what is this, Live Another Day?
[02:35:09.653 --> 02:35:10.054]  Big Mike?
[02:35:10.274 --> 02:35:10.975]  Yeah, Big Mike.
[02:35:12.256 --> 02:35:18.281]  So they're telling us, the cyber attacks, isn't this what the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab have been trying to condition the American public to accept?
[02:35:18.301 --> 02:35:20.203]  Yeah, now they put it in full pop gear.
[02:35:20.603 --> 02:35:22.565]  Before they were pre-programming, I'm really concerned.
[02:35:23.025 --> 02:35:24.667]  What did they say at John Miller on the other day?
[02:35:24.687 --> 02:35:34.416]  One of these actors, this is Sandra Bullock or one of these washed up people, says, you know, don't just dole out trust to anybody, especially white people.
[02:35:35.297 --> 02:35:36.018]  They're just saying this.
[02:35:36.058 --> 02:35:37.479]  What if he said that about Jews?
[02:35:37.539 --> 02:35:38.841]  What if he said that about black people?
[02:35:39.341 --> 02:35:43.047]  And I hate to be the guy that... Well, there's no doubt that Hollywood's promoting racial division.
[02:35:43.227 --> 02:35:46.993]  I hate to be the... Sean Hannity just continued to point out the hypocrisy.
[02:35:47.013 --> 02:35:48.435]  What I'm about is moving the ball.
[02:35:49.076 --> 02:35:54.424]  What I'm about is implementing a strategy for Americans to take America back.
[02:35:55.305 --> 02:36:04.293]  Uh, and when you talk about Trump 2024, when you talk about any congressional elections, when you talk about presidential elections, I mean, I think that they've been stolen for a very long time.
[02:36:04.313 --> 02:36:05.614]  I think that they've been rigged and set up.
[02:36:06.035 --> 02:36:11.380]  I don't know if Trump was the guy that they needed to come and shake everything up and to polarize every single topic that we have.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.461]  I don't know if it was, you know, to create.
[02:36:13.801 --> 02:36:15.322]  You say that they want violence in the streets.
[02:36:15.723 --> 02:36:16.343]  I agree with that.
[02:36:16.863 --> 02:36:18.404]  I think that there is violence in the streets.
[02:36:18.765 --> 02:36:21.306]  I mean, look at what we saw over the Summer of Love in 2020.
[02:36:21.346 --> 02:36:29.772]  Twelve billion dollars in damage carried out, you know, and instigated by sitting members of Congress while people robbed and raped and looted.
[02:36:29.812 --> 02:36:30.793]  You talked about Antifa.
[02:36:31.073 --> 02:36:32.394]  They targeted police officers.
[02:36:32.434 --> 02:36:33.355]  They assassinated them.
[02:36:33.375 --> 02:36:34.696]  They threw Derek Chauvin in prison.
[02:36:34.956 --> 02:36:37.237]  They're trying to throw Trump in prison for hundreds of years.
[02:36:37.658 --> 02:36:40.780]  They've got J6ers still being held as prisoners of war in American soil.
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:44.524]  I mean, we are a country that's being attacked by its own government.
[02:36:44.564 --> 02:36:45.665]  We are at war right now.
[02:36:46.426 --> 02:36:48.148]  And too many people are complacent.
[02:36:48.528 --> 02:36:49.670]  Too many people are apathetic.
[02:36:49.690 --> 02:36:51.312]  Too many people are willfully ignorant.
[02:36:51.952 --> 02:36:55.456]  And, you know, when you say things like, you know, it's a catchy phrase, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:36:55.496 --> 02:37:00.863]  Well, who the hell are we to think that we can just inherit this country?
[02:37:02.093 --> 02:37:12.638]  That was built on the sacrifice of those who died in piles of spent shell casings in these useless and fake wars to give us individual liberty, bodily autonomy and freedom.
[02:37:13.379 --> 02:37:19.142]  When is it going to be our time to actually do something to take our country back and what does that look like?
[02:37:20.182 --> 02:37:21.904]  We're not going to vote our way out of this.
[02:37:22.445 --> 02:37:36.520]  And it doesn't really matter who's in power right now if they're subservient to whether it's the Chinese Communists, if they're subservient to the Middle East because of our oil, if they're subservient to the central banking criminal cabal, if they're subservient to Israel.
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:37.201]  It doesn't matter.
[02:37:37.241 --> 02:37:39.303]  But they're not doing the bidding of the American people.
[02:37:39.343 --> 02:37:47.700]   They are all controlled And when you talk about counter-narratives and you look at somebody like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez versus Marjorie Taylor Greene, aren't they the same person?
[02:37:48.501 --> 02:37:49.902]  They get their topics.
[02:37:50.962 --> 02:37:52.403]  I like Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[02:37:52.543 --> 02:37:53.444]  AOC.
[02:37:53.564 --> 02:37:58.567]  But in our fake system of this two-party representative... Yeah, but everybody says everybody's fake.
[02:37:58.627 --> 02:38:00.389]   I mean, Mark M.T.G.' 's a great lady.
[02:38:00.409 --> 02:38:01.569]  And I love her.
[02:38:01.629 --> 02:38:03.471]  And she stands up for free speech and everything.
[02:38:03.531 --> 02:38:03.991]  Sweetheart.
[02:38:04.011 --> 02:38:06.353]  I know you go after her a lot.
[02:38:06.393 --> 02:38:06.673]  Why?
[02:38:08.646 --> 02:38:09.307]  Well, she's lied.
[02:38:09.967 --> 02:38:10.487]  Many times.
[02:38:11.228 --> 02:38:12.909]  I'm going to go up against rhinos.
[02:38:12.929 --> 02:38:14.791]  I'm going to do all this for the J6ers.
[02:38:15.331 --> 02:38:16.212]  Photo opportunities.
[02:38:17.072 --> 02:38:19.654]  She's had hearings about the poison shots?
[02:38:19.674 --> 02:38:28.981]  I think that we have much bigger problems on our hands that need to be dealt with imminently or we are going to... Yeah, like how about we spend time on Dick Durbin instead of MTG?
[02:38:29.021 --> 02:38:30.923]  Yeah, we could do that.
[02:38:32.787 --> 02:38:34.993]  We've got a handful of the best Congress people.
[02:38:35.053 --> 02:38:39.065]  Didn't Dick Durbin just make it impossible for the Epstein client log to ever come out?
[02:38:39.085 --> 02:38:40.088]  That's what I mean, I mean...
[02:38:40.888 --> 02:38:51.035]  Marge Taylor Greene, I mean, I see your show some, you do an informative show, I watch it some, and it's like, but then I'm like, oh, we're, I mean, MTG's the issue, we've our problem?
[02:38:51.376 --> 02:38:55.779]  I just don't think that we have anybody in our government that's really legitimately doing the bidding of the people.
[02:38:56.279 --> 02:38:58.160]  I don't think that we have a legitimate structure.
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:02.764]  Well, once you're in the government, though, there's a, it's very hard.
[02:39:03.064 --> 02:39:04.225]  I think she's trying to get stuff done.
[02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:09.888]  What I meant when I said the difference between AOC and Marjorie Taylor Greene is that they get their talking points.
[02:39:09.928 --> 02:39:12.652]  These are people who have to constantly have issues.
[02:39:13.113 --> 02:39:15.816]  But finding solutions to the issues puts them out of work.
[02:39:16.690 --> 02:39:17.951]  So for AOC, it's what?
[02:39:18.371 --> 02:39:19.071]  The environment.
[02:39:19.511 --> 02:39:20.192]  And racism.
[02:39:20.692 --> 02:39:22.413]  And environmental racism.
[02:39:22.793 --> 02:39:28.676]  And for Marjorie Taylor Greene, it's exposing the deep state, and crushing rhinos, and January Sixers.
[02:39:28.736 --> 02:39:34.959]  But if there's ever a solution that's presented by members of our government, then we don't need to fund the government.
[02:39:34.979 --> 02:39:35.339]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:39:35.359 --> 02:39:38.141]  Just because they're trying to fix stuff and they haven't doesn't mean she's bad.
[02:39:39.761 --> 02:39:40.402]  It's cyclical.
[02:39:41.244 --> 02:39:45.371]  Every single representative in our government talks about issues.
[02:39:46.133 --> 02:39:51.703]  You're a likable guy, but it's easy to armchair quarterback and then say that she, why hasn't she fixed everything?
[02:39:54.676 --> 02:39:57.139]  I don't think that she needs to single-handedly fix anything.
[02:39:57.599 --> 02:40:01.303]  What I'm merely pointing out is that it doesn't matter if it's Marjorie Taylor Greene or AOC.
[02:40:01.604 --> 02:40:03.305]  Use Dick Durbin as an example if you want to.
[02:40:03.886 --> 02:40:07.550]  We don't have a government that does- Or Mitch McConnell, the evil turtle.
[02:40:07.870 --> 02:40:08.671]  Sure, the turtle lord.
[02:40:09.212 --> 02:40:10.553]  Or- The turtle lord.
[02:40:10.573 --> 02:40:11.614]  The Raytheon whore.
[02:40:11.735 --> 02:40:12.856]  You know, Lindsey Graham.
[02:40:12.936 --> 02:40:14.458]  Or eyepatch guy, Dan Crenshaw.
[02:40:15.322 --> 02:40:16.022]  Now you're talking.
[02:40:16.082 --> 02:40:17.283]  Those are people that are really bad.
[02:40:17.623 --> 02:40:20.124]  These people want to kill everyone, I mean, on the planet.
[02:40:20.144 --> 02:40:21.324]  I mean, take Joe Rogan.
[02:40:21.344 --> 02:40:22.304]  He's gotten a lot better.
[02:40:22.704 --> 02:40:23.545]  He's waking up.
[02:40:24.065 --> 02:40:25.105]  He's not controlled by anybody.
[02:40:25.145 --> 02:40:26.045]  I know Joe.
[02:40:26.986 --> 02:40:27.866]  He's in a process.
[02:40:27.906 --> 02:40:28.546]  He's getting better.
[02:40:30.647 --> 02:40:31.367]  I think we all do.
[02:40:32.047 --> 02:40:33.828]  Every day we try to get better at what we do.
[02:40:33.928 --> 02:40:36.109]  Every day we try to dig for more information.
[02:40:36.149 --> 02:40:37.369]  You think they killed Trump?
[02:40:38.129 --> 02:40:39.470]  Because I don't know what else they can do now.
[02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:41.410]  They really screwed the pooch on this.
[02:40:42.271 --> 02:40:43.571]  They will absolutely kill Trump.
[02:40:44.741 --> 02:40:54.330]  Yeah, and now we're hearing that Jack Smith is coming with more indictments that Donald Trump actually orchestrated and tried to carry out, you know, an insurrection against the U.S.
[02:40:54.370 --> 02:40:54.770]  government.
[02:40:55.591 --> 02:40:57.073]  This is a crime that's punishable by death.
[02:40:57.593 --> 02:41:02.458]  So, I mean, they could kill him illegitimately, they could poison him, they could assassinate him, or they could kill him, you know, under the fake law.
[02:41:03.419 --> 02:41:05.581]  This, this is really dangerous.
[02:41:05.621 --> 02:41:09.124]  The times that we're in are very dangerous when our DOJ is targeting America.
[02:41:10.498 --> 02:41:17.007]  Trump's daughter has Jewish children and is super pro-Israel, but Trump's good and they want to kill him.
[02:41:17.308 --> 02:41:19.691]  Come on, I just want to say it's more sophisticated.
[02:41:19.751 --> 02:41:20.993]  I didn't say Trump was good.
[02:41:21.233 --> 02:41:22.635]  I don't know what's going on with Trump.
[02:41:22.715 --> 02:41:25.640]  I know that the Trump of 2015 is not the Trump that we're seeing right now.
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:26.521]  So you don't support Trump?
[02:41:28.717 --> 02:41:30.038]  I don't think Trump is a solution.
[02:41:30.438 --> 02:41:33.161]  I don't think any one man... Well, I don't think we should put all our faith in Trump.
[02:41:33.261 --> 02:41:33.841]  I agree with that.
[02:41:33.861 --> 02:41:34.762]  But I think Trump's good.
[02:41:35.102 --> 02:41:35.963]  He wants prosperity.
[02:41:36.023 --> 02:41:38.505]  He's trying to... I mean, he wants a merited economy.
[02:41:39.666 --> 02:41:40.486]  He wants a border.
[02:41:40.927 --> 02:41:42.048]  And that's a great place to start.
[02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:46.872]  If we had a border that was, I mean, a real border, we have a non-existent border.
[02:41:46.972 --> 02:41:47.432]  No, I hear you.
[02:41:47.552 --> 02:41:51.996]  So, so, yeah, so I'm saying there's a lot of diversity out there in the ideas.
[02:41:52.496 --> 02:41:53.457]  What are you going to interview me about?
[02:41:55.512 --> 02:41:58.173]  I just want to have a real conversation about mobilizing the American people.
[02:41:58.833 --> 02:42:00.694]  We've got to start moving the ball towards solutions.
[02:42:00.874 --> 02:42:02.055]  Yeah, well what about your statement?
[02:42:02.075 --> 02:42:04.076]  Because I think violence is not the answer.
[02:42:04.116 --> 02:42:04.776]  You agree with that, right?
[02:42:07.897 --> 02:42:11.379]  You know, I don't like unnecessary violence.
[02:42:12.139 --> 02:42:14.660]  I don't think that anybody should be attacked for their ideologies.
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:17.961]  I don't think that anybody should be attacked for their faith, for their religion.
[02:42:18.322 --> 02:42:21.483]  I don't think anybody should be attacked for their race or their ethnicity.
[02:42:23.339 --> 02:42:26.337]  But I don't believe that there's a political solution to the problems that we're facing.
[02:42:27.591 --> 02:42:32.835]  And the last thing that I want to do is leave the mess that we have now, a country that's deteriorating.
[02:42:32.855 --> 02:42:34.056]  So what are the military targets?
[02:42:34.096 --> 02:42:34.676]  To my children.
[02:42:35.417 --> 02:42:36.678]  I don't want to leave this fight to them.
[02:42:36.698 --> 02:42:39.080]  You think violence might be an answer?
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:41.601]  I don't think that it's the answer, but I think that it may be inevitable.
[02:42:42.122 --> 02:42:45.544]  If it's inevitable, then we should be talking about targets.
[02:42:45.604 --> 02:42:46.645]  I don't support violence.
[02:42:47.366 --> 02:42:48.126]  I don't support that.
[02:42:48.146 --> 02:42:50.868]  I'm not calling for anybody to go and act violently.
[02:42:51.469 --> 02:42:53.650]  But what I am saying is that... Because you're ready to party.
[02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:54.651]  You're at 3am right now.
[02:42:56.724 --> 02:43:03.350]  Tells us what to do with a government that is oppressive to our God-given, constitutional, inherent, inalienable rights.
[02:43:04.130 --> 02:43:08.895]  And that is to remove or abolish that form of government and to replace it with a government that's representative of the people.
[02:43:09.455 --> 02:43:13.479]  And I think that we would be derelict in our duties if we didn't start talking about what that looks like.
[02:43:14.301 --> 02:43:15.262]  Because that's what we have.
[02:43:15.302 --> 02:43:17.264]  Well, and they're trying to start a physical war.
[02:43:17.304 --> 02:43:19.106]  They may trigger it with false flags, and then we're in it.
[02:43:19.166 --> 02:43:20.988]  So, yeah, we've got to have a discussion about that.
[02:43:21.008 --> 02:43:22.810]  Maybe we'll talk about that on your show.
[02:43:22.850 --> 02:43:24.031]  I guess it'll air sometime next week?
[02:43:24.291 --> 02:43:24.852]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:25.232 --> 02:43:27.815]  Alright, StuPeters.com, at RealStuPeters on Twitter.
[02:43:28.115 --> 02:43:29.236]  Hey, you like Elon Musk?
[02:43:30.394 --> 02:43:32.998]  I agree with what he's doing lately, and I'm glad that he reinstated you.
[02:43:33.018 --> 02:43:33.799]  Welcome back to Twitter.
[02:43:34.139 --> 02:43:35.601]  Yeah, I mean, you can't disagree with that.
[02:43:35.621 --> 02:43:36.783]  All right, are you sure?
[02:43:36.803 --> 02:43:39.106]  He's standing up to advertisers and telling them to F off.
[02:43:39.847 --> 02:43:40.327]  And it's great.
[02:43:40.467 --> 02:43:41.489]  You told me to go fuck yourself.
[02:43:41.669 --> 02:43:41.829]  Yeah.
[02:43:42.450 --> 02:43:43.531]  All right, Stu Peters.
[02:43:44.032 --> 02:43:45.895]  All right, Drew Hernandez takes over now.
[02:43:45.955 --> 02:43:47.557]  Then Owen Schroyer in 45 minutes.
[02:43:49.082 --> 02:43:56.366]  Well, InfoWarriors worldwide, welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, the most banned transmission in the universe.
[02:43:57.066 --> 02:43:58.987]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[02:43:59.007 --> 02:44:02.429]  Good to see every single one of you guys watching wherever you're at.
[02:44:02.509 --> 02:44:05.231]  Band.Video, Rumble.com, radio listeners, wherever.
[02:44:05.271 --> 02:44:07.092]  We appreciate every single one of you guys.
[02:44:07.692 --> 02:44:42.073]   With the rise of the occult and the rise of Satanism and globalism all wrapped in one, With the spirit of the Antichrist making strides through proxy organizations and individuals like the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, John Kerry with the climate death cult agenda and machine that is slowly, I could say, really losing credibility, but at the same time rapidly showing their true colors because millions of people are falling for it.
[02:44:43.195 --> 02:44:46.738]  But millions of people are waking up to this reality.
[02:44:46.758 --> 02:44:47.879]  They are getting red-pilled.
[02:44:48.659 --> 02:44:56.685]  Slowly but surely, we are making progress with those made in the image of God realizing that they're made in his image because they've been given free will.
[02:44:56.705 --> 02:45:05.732]  And you see the rise of the occult, very similar to ancient civilizations in history's past, hundreds, thousands of years ago.
[02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:16.080]  Many ancient civilizations from the Babylonians look at the Tower of Babel and the worldwide government that erected the tower to ascend above God because they had Lucifer in their hearts.
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:17.881]  You can see this everywhere.
[02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:21.202]  You see this in Roman culture and interfacing with the occult.
[02:45:21.222 --> 02:45:27.785]  You take a look at modern times with Nazis interfacing with mediums and the occult.
[02:45:27.825 --> 02:45:30.306]  And you see this, you see this in civilizations.
[02:45:31.483 --> 02:45:39.606]  Attempting to interface with entities for the sake of advanced wisdom, for the sake of what they believe to be advanced technology.
[02:45:39.786 --> 02:45:45.268]  And I think right now as we go further into the future, we are going to see this resurgence.
[02:45:45.989 --> 02:45:47.829]  Because humanity goes through cycles.
[02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:49.910]  The timeline goes through cycles.
[02:45:49.970 --> 02:45:51.651]  Civilizations go through cycles.
[02:45:52.674 --> 02:45:56.197]  And near the end of a civilization or a superpower, you see the same thing.
[02:45:56.237 --> 02:46:10.928]  You see, like I said, Egyptians, Babylonians, you go across the entire timeline for humanity, and there's always a huge push to interface with beings that offer them and deliver them some kind of advanced wisdom that they believe to be technology.
[02:46:10.948 --> 02:46:26.654]   Or they view individuals with supernatural abilities that have the ability to contact these entities to deliver off-worlds what they believe off-worlds Supernatural knowledge, wisdom that the Bible calls demonic wisdom, by the way, in the book of James.
[02:46:27.474 --> 02:46:37.038]  And you've seen this exactly with Aztec Mayans and ancient civilizations that practice human sacrifice and the slaughter of humans and the dismemberment of humans.
[02:46:37.558 --> 02:46:39.579]  I mean, America is doing that right now with babies.
[02:46:40.379 --> 02:46:47.362]  America is doing that right now with children in and outside of the womb, slaughtering their bodies, dismembering their body parts.
[02:46:48.334 --> 02:46:57.241]  And then women that are super cringe that are all, you know, so-called boss babies, you know, boss babes that are so obsessed, it's my career, it's my career.
[02:46:57.281 --> 02:46:59.283]  That's the human blood sacrifice.
[02:46:59.303 --> 02:47:03.546]  You have these selfish, retard fornicators, okay?
[02:47:03.586 --> 02:47:09.851]  That's the reason for abortion and slaughtering babies, because all these retard, boss babe, feminazi types, what do they do?
[02:47:10.569 --> 02:47:11.049]  What do they do?
[02:47:11.069 --> 02:47:12.310]  They all say the same thing.
[02:47:12.671 --> 02:47:15.313]  Well, I need to get an abortion because of my dreams!
[02:47:15.873 --> 02:47:17.054]  Because of my dreams!
[02:47:17.134 --> 02:47:18.696]  I can't let go of my career!
[02:47:18.716 --> 02:47:19.616]  I can't!
[02:47:19.917 --> 02:47:20.657]  I can't!
[02:47:20.697 --> 02:47:21.418]  I'm not ready!
[02:47:21.758 --> 02:47:22.459]  I'm not ready!
[02:47:22.499 --> 02:47:23.680]  So then why are you a whore?
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:24.700]  Why are you fornicating?
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:25.841]  What are you doing with your life?
[02:47:26.362 --> 02:47:30.165]  Well, I have to sacrifice and dismember this baby because of my dreams!
[02:47:30.725 --> 02:47:32.467]  My career and my dreams!
[02:47:32.727 --> 02:47:35.269]  We have to murder this child because of my dreams!
[02:47:36.264 --> 02:47:38.725]  Screw your career and screw your dreams!
[02:47:39.206 --> 02:47:43.688]  But the point is, that's actually our modern-day child-human sacrifice.
[02:47:44.668 --> 02:47:46.269]  You are sacrificing a baby.
[02:47:46.329 --> 02:47:56.755]  You are shedding their blood to sacrifice their future, sacrifice their life, sacrifice their right to live and have a shot at life.
[02:47:57.295 --> 02:48:00.897]  You are sacrificing that as a selfish, fornicating whore.
[02:48:03.493 --> 02:48:10.235]  For your career, their blood for your career, their blood for your future, their blood for your job and your dreams.
[02:48:11.956 --> 02:48:15.597]  You see, like I said, civilization goes through cycles and that's exactly what we're seeing right now.
[02:48:16.817 --> 02:48:26.180]  And I think the United States of America is currently going through a cycle of out in the open Luciferianism, out in the open Satanism.
[02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:27.680]  You're seeing this in state capitals.
[02:48:28.621 --> 02:48:31.982]  You're seeing this at elementary schools, K through 12.
[02:48:33.174 --> 02:48:40.119]  Public school with the satanic temple infiltrating very rapidly many schools across the United States of America.
[02:48:40.139 --> 02:48:43.081]  And it's interesting because you know, they try to spin it as well.
[02:48:43.141 --> 02:48:49.346]  You know, we're we're just it's just it's all just a joke, you know, it just we just we just really want to gaslight people.
[02:48:49.386 --> 02:48:57.892]  We want to trigger people by using Satan and using pentagrams by going after children because we do it all in the guise of free speech, right?
[02:49:00.574 --> 02:49:05.959]   And then even in Teenage Girl Magazine, famous, targeting young girls
[02:49:05.959 --> 02:49:10.179]   to teach them satanic rituals and seances while they're taking drugs, murdering children,
[02:49:10.179 --> 02:49:12.779]  practicing human sacrifice.
[02:49:12.779 --> 02:49:18.899]   You see, the United States of America is not in a place, and our world is not in a place where satanism
[02:49:18.899 --> 02:49:26.780]   is being pushed and luciferianism is being pushed on our society, on our children, on our culture.
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:29.500]  We've already gotten past that.
[02:49:29.361 --> 02:49:30.942]  It's totally embraced.
[02:49:31.002 --> 02:49:32.642]  With the removal of God and everything.
[02:49:32.662 --> 02:49:37.223]  With this retardation of separation in church and state.
[02:49:37.263 --> 02:49:38.203]  Whatever that means.
[02:49:39.683 --> 02:49:41.623]  So what is separation in church and state?
[02:49:41.723 --> 02:49:42.563]  That's satanic.
[02:49:43.304 --> 02:49:43.844]  Okay?
[02:49:43.904 --> 02:49:45.444]  That's an operation of Lucifer.
[02:49:45.484 --> 02:49:47.044]  Because they've switched that.
[02:49:47.064 --> 02:49:48.044]  They've inverted that.
[02:49:48.424 --> 02:49:57.206]  And they've turned that into the church not being able to engage in the affairs of mankind, a civilization, or a government.
[02:49:58.180 --> 02:50:06.103]  And then you get cucked out churches and pastors that go along with that because they want to keep their comfy little megachurch 501c3 tax write-offs?
[02:50:06.503 --> 02:50:08.044]  Don't piss off the government, Pastor!
[02:50:08.064 --> 02:50:11.405]  Because if you do, then you're going to lose your tax write-off positions!
[02:50:12.846 --> 02:50:13.606]  So who do you worship?
[02:50:14.341 --> 02:50:18.623]  Big God or big government and the 501c3, my little friend.
[02:50:18.643 --> 02:50:22.944]  This happened all over the cross of the United States of America and it's an agenda of Satan.
[02:50:23.445 --> 02:50:34.009]  The church should 100% born-again Christians should 100% be in full operational infiltration of the governments of the world.
[02:50:34.725 --> 02:50:36.127]  Because the other side does this.
[02:50:36.167 --> 02:50:38.110]  The Luciferians and the Satanists do this.
[02:50:38.431 --> 02:50:39.392]  The commies do this.
[02:50:39.973 --> 02:50:41.375]  The critical Marxists do this.
[02:50:41.956 --> 02:50:45.101]  With all their critical race theory, excuse me, the cultural Marxists do this.
[02:50:46.443 --> 02:50:47.844]  And everybody else gets to do this.
[02:50:48.164 --> 02:50:49.965]  Everybody else gets to infiltrate government.
[02:50:50.045 --> 02:50:54.427]  Everybody else gets to infiltrate education, the scientific community, the medical community.
[02:50:54.467 --> 02:50:56.948]  They get to infiltrate even the sports arena.
[02:50:56.988 --> 02:51:04.451]  They get to infiltrate everything with their depravity, with their satanism, and their luciferianism, and their pedophilia, and their doctrines of demons.
[02:51:05.892 --> 02:51:08.113]  What's separation of church and state, bro?
[02:51:08.993 --> 02:51:10.034]  Listen, you guys know me.
[02:51:10.634 --> 02:51:12.155]  I'm a Christ supremacist.
[02:51:12.893 --> 02:51:14.194]  I wear that crown with honor.
[02:51:14.534 --> 02:51:15.655]  I'll get cancelled for that.
[02:51:16.036 --> 02:51:19.118]  You know, when people come around, they say, Drew Hernandez is a Christian nationalist.
[02:51:19.158 --> 02:51:20.339]  He's a Christian fascist.
[02:51:20.579 --> 02:51:21.560]  Dude, that's weak.
[02:51:22.161 --> 02:51:23.261]  Stop saying that about me.
[02:51:23.582 --> 02:51:24.683]  That's not based enough.
[02:51:25.103 --> 02:51:28.165]  Let's take it a little further and make it a little more biblical.
[02:51:28.746 --> 02:51:30.267]  I am a Christ supremacist.
[02:51:30.347 --> 02:51:34.771]  I believe in the supremacy of Jesus Christ in every aspect of life.
[02:51:36.175 --> 02:51:40.117]  The seen world and the unseen world, above all principalities and powers.
[02:51:40.877 --> 02:51:41.178]  All right?
[02:51:41.218 --> 02:51:45.820]  The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, in government, outside of government, education.
[02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:51.283]  I believe the supremacy of Jesus Christ shall invade all of humanity, take over all of humanity.
[02:51:51.503 --> 02:51:52.263]  Because you know what?
[02:51:52.823 --> 02:51:55.505]  The Kingdom of God is at hand and it's inevitable anyways.
[02:51:56.417 --> 02:51:58.819]  People want to know how we restabilize culture.
[02:51:59.179 --> 02:52:05.885]  People want to know why we're being invaded with Luciferianism and doctrines of demons from every nation on the face of planet Earth.
[02:52:06.265 --> 02:52:12.910]  Whether we're being invaded and infiltrated from the CCP or the Ukraine or Israel or whoever it may be.
[02:52:13.951 --> 02:52:15.412]  Lucifer has his hands in everything.
[02:52:16.173 --> 02:52:28.656]   This world, this nation needs to come back to the one true God because everything That has been infiltrated is because God has been removed from all of these institutions.
[02:52:28.756 --> 02:52:29.796]  So we're paying the price.
[02:52:30.097 --> 02:52:30.757]  We got a lot of intel.
[02:52:30.777 --> 02:52:31.277]  We'll read back.
[02:52:31.817 --> 02:52:37.200]  The global cabal and the satanic elite, they know that civilization works in cycles.
[02:52:38.521 --> 02:53:01.981]   So every time you look at organizations like the World Economic Forum or whenever the World Health Organization or any type of NGO that is In cahoots or is in lockstep with any type of globalist agenda, they call themselves shareholders of the future, of what they believe to be the global utopia of the future that's perfected by humanity, which is never going to happen.
[02:53:02.562 --> 02:53:08.987]  Humanity has fallen and will never have a perfect world apart from Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God.
[02:53:09.887 --> 02:53:15.272]  And that is the heart of Lucifer to counterfeit what Christ is, what Christ will do.
[02:53:16.509 --> 02:53:19.310]  Because he wants to be God and ascend above God.
[02:53:19.370 --> 02:53:31.715]  So the global Luciferian cults, like I said, the death cult with all the climate change death cult organizations and NGOs with John Kerry or whether you look at the World Economic Forum or the World Health Organization, the CDC, you name it!
[02:53:32.695 --> 02:53:40.758]  Or the big ESG machines with the DEI machines discriminating against white people predominantly.
[02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:52.740]  Especially in the United States of America, because a woke, retarded black person will get a job before a high IQ intellectual white person, based off of the color of the skin.
[02:53:53.841 --> 02:54:05.310]  And so as we continue to see this, you guys, they know very well, because they're empowered by these satanic powers, how civilizations work in cycles.
[02:54:05.370 --> 02:54:14.006]   So when you take a look at the World Economic Forum, and we're going to go over this report today, Because this has to do with our future, especially in terms of globalism.
[02:54:14.367 --> 02:54:16.708]  That's why they come out, and they've always done this for decades.
[02:54:16.749 --> 02:54:17.909]  This is Agenda 2020.
[02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:20.892]  This is Agenda 2021.
[02:54:20.972 --> 02:54:21.993]  This is Agenda 2030.
[02:54:23.134 --> 02:54:23.814]  Agenda 2050.
[02:54:24.355 --> 02:54:27.437]  By the year 20X, Y, and Z, there will be this.
[02:54:27.497 --> 02:54:28.238]  There will be that.
[02:54:28.258 --> 02:54:35.784]  And that's why Klaus Schwab is always emphasizing becoming masters of the future by mastering the technologies of today or the technologies of the future.
[02:54:36.508 --> 02:54:40.690]  Because that is how they're going to control humanity, because they understand this and they fundamentally know this.
[02:54:41.390 --> 02:54:49.394]  So when you take a look at the white papers, and which is interesting, and people should know this by now, on the World Economic Forum of these globalists, they put their writings up.
[02:54:49.434 --> 02:54:55.656]  It's like their own satanic, you know, self-fulfilling prophecies that they want to roll out on humanity.
[02:54:55.676 --> 02:55:16.461]   These people are absolutely serious about installing what they want to do technologically, Which I think is pretty interesting because a new white paper came out early December, about a week ago, that has to do with the future of communication and information in our world, not just our country, but in our world.
[02:55:17.001 --> 02:55:25.640]   This is InfoWars.com, the World Economic Forum likens misinformation To a cyber security issue and calls for more action.
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:27.561]  This is a 16 page document.
[02:55:27.601 --> 02:55:29.322]  People can read this for themselves.
[02:55:29.842 --> 02:55:36.984]  A white paper by the World Economic Forum, where they are redefining what cyber security literally is.
[02:55:37.144 --> 02:55:44.307]  Now, according to a recent study by the World Economic Forum and allied organizations, cyber security concerns are taking on new dimensions.
[02:55:44.947 --> 02:55:52.351]  Misinformation and disinformation disseminated via the internet are now being framed as a key challenge in ensuring cybersecurity.
[02:55:52.712 --> 02:56:02.758]  The troubling report was launched on December 5th and designated as Cybersecurity Futures 2030 New Foundations.
[02:56:02.778 --> 02:56:10.102]  The study in depth goes over the future of cybersecurity lies rather than safeguarding the integrity and source of data.
[02:56:11.064 --> 02:56:21.551]  This introduces a novel perspective on the significance of locating and quashing fabricated information, cynically tagged as mis- or disinformation, held in the cybersecurity domain.
[02:56:21.951 --> 02:56:32.518]  Now, when you go over this report in detail, one of the main highlights that I really want to emphasize in this report, in their own words, is that the World Economic Forum is now looking to the year 2030.
[02:56:32.698 --> 02:56:35.600]  And they talked about this in Davos 23.
[02:56:37.549 --> 02:56:46.635]  They talked about a massive cyber security, excuse me, a massive cyber attack going on in our worlds within the next two years.
[02:56:48.256 --> 02:56:56.721]  And now this white paper has rolled out by the World Economic Forum where they are wargaming and they are planning and they are preemptively preparing as, you know, Bill Gates likes to say.
[02:56:57.782 --> 02:57:05.027]  With the Cybersecurity Futures 2030 World Economic Forum white paper document, this is pretty fresh, fresh off the New World Order press.
[02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:10.994]  And within this document, they talk about what cybersecurity looks like in our future.
[02:57:11.994 --> 02:57:15.697]  And you and I will know cybersecurity as protecting our private data.
[02:57:16.337 --> 02:57:31.608]  And you and I would think of cybersecurity as protecting Intel information, whether it's our medical history, or whether it's our family history, or whether it's our credit card, bank accounts, private information, Social Security, you name it, or whatever you have on your own private home computer.
[02:57:32.769 --> 02:57:43.173]   The protection of information Also, in a militarized national security perspective as well, you would probably think of it the exact same way.
[02:57:43.953 --> 02:57:50.478]  Cyberattacks that are meant to infiltrate American digital infrastructure, power grids, etc.
[02:57:50.558 --> 02:57:51.299]  You name it, right?
[02:57:52.034 --> 02:58:01.156]  But what the World Economic Forum is now doing within this new 2030 report, they have now redefined even what cyber security even means.
[02:58:01.556 --> 02:58:18.499]  So they have taken that from making sure that data is protected, but in the future, New World Order, in the mind of the globalist World Economic Forum, they are now pontificating and redefining that cyber security also means the integrity of the information that's being protected.
[02:58:18.519 --> 02:58:19.859]  These are their own words.
[02:58:20.559 --> 02:58:30.326]  So they're taking it from just not only protecting information, but we want to not only monopolize information, we want to monopolize the integrity of the information.
[02:58:31.007 --> 02:58:36.991]  So that's why now in the name of cyber security, it's the same thing they've done with 9-11, with the Patriot Act, it's the same thing they've done post-2020.
[02:58:38.542 --> 02:58:50.830]  Stay home, save lives, wear 10 masks, save lives, take 10 jabs and 10 boosters, save lives in the name of safety and security, sacrifice your freedoms for the sake of safety and security, etc.
[02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:51.110]  Right?
[02:58:52.151 --> 02:58:56.374]  And now they're taking it in a technological dimension because that's the future.
[02:58:57.695 --> 02:59:14.432]   And they expect, even in this report, They talk about making sure that companies and governments and elected officials re-educate individuals when it comes to the new defined terms and the new defined world of what cyber security actually looks like.
[02:59:14.493 --> 02:59:18.975]  And they will build an army, re-educating armies of people in various different companies.
[02:59:19.952 --> 02:59:29.239]  That are aware of what cyber security and fighting against cyber attacks is truly supposed to look like and educating them on what, what does disinformation mean?
[02:59:29.699 --> 02:59:32.101]  What does a disinformation campaign look like?
[02:59:32.401 --> 02:59:34.242]  What truly is misinformation?
[02:59:34.623 --> 02:59:43.289]  While the context of this report as well, they are now redefining saying, well, we have to protect the integrity of the actual information itself.
[02:59:44.109 --> 02:59:46.251]  So we all know what that means, right?
[02:59:46.914 --> 03:00:06.962]  We know that it is just another ESG DEI program that is going to be all gay, woke, New World Order, and everything is going to be judged based upon this SJW social justice mindset, communist, cultural Marxist ideology that's already infiltrated corporate America and the governments of the world.
[03:00:07.422 --> 03:00:12.504]  So now they're going to roll that out in a cyber security context?
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:17.711]  You see, this is how they're going to weaponize and harness the entire internet across the entire world.
[03:00:17.731 --> 03:00:21.761]  And they're going to continue to push this further and further and further and further and further.
[03:00:22.594 --> 03:00:29.620]  Where now it will give them a right, okay, well, we are Big Brother, and we will be the ones to offer you cyber security.
[03:00:29.660 --> 03:00:31.001]  We will protect your data.
[03:00:31.121 --> 03:00:54.623]   Oh, but by the way, we have to make sure that your data is up to par, because the fact checkers and all the homosexual BLM fat black women are gonna sit there, and they're gonna sift through all your information, and if it's not up to par, if we declare that this is hate speech, Well, then they are going to go after you and consider you probably one of the misinformation and disinformation agents.
[03:00:54.943 --> 03:00:58.368]  This is the Trojan horse to even further out in the open.
[03:00:58.388 --> 03:00:59.169]  Guys, we already know.
[03:00:59.569 --> 03:01:04.095]  We already know that the NSA, the CIA, intelligence agencies, they're already breaching.
[03:01:04.156 --> 03:01:05.858]  They're already breaching American privacy.
[03:01:06.371 --> 03:01:13.677]  These people could look at all your intel, they could hack all of your phones, they could do anything they want, they could literally look into every aspect of your entire life.
[03:01:14.078 --> 03:01:20.143]  If you have security cameras like Ring in your home, they could look into that too and watch you and your wife walking around at home, right?
[03:01:20.363 --> 03:01:20.984]  And your children.
[03:01:22.745 --> 03:01:26.409]  But this is coming in the form of, well, we're here to protect you.
[03:01:27.770 --> 03:01:36.279]   So not only do we have to protect your info, but we have to make sure that your information is actually Up to par according to our standards.
[03:01:36.819 --> 03:01:43.362]  So yes, yes, this is how the New World Order is going to function in this age of technocracy.
[03:01:43.762 --> 03:01:51.825]  Well, we will prop ourselves up as your protector because you are too low IQ and a stupid human, so you need us to re-educate you.
[03:01:52.045 --> 03:01:54.446]  It's literally the Matrix, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:55.587 --> 03:02:01.349]  The World Economic Forum is wargaming a future out in the open Matrix.
[03:02:02.449 --> 03:02:02.850]  No lie.
[03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:03.510]  We'll be right back.
[03:02:03.971 --> 03:02:04.572]  All right!

[03:03:05.073 --> 03:03:35.970]   Just gonna predict it now, but let's get back into the information ladies and gentlemen and info warriors like I said speaking of these globalist proxies and arms and institutions of Satan himself World Economic Forum war gaming for 2030 like I said to monopolize information Redefining what cyber security actually means as a breach of your information to control your information, but also the World Health Organization Is making strides as well for the year 2024 to seize full power by the year 2026.
[03:03:37.831 --> 03:03:39.673]  Here's another article at Infowars.com.
[03:03:39.693 --> 03:03:44.356]  These amendments would open the door to a dangerous global health bureaucracy.
[03:03:44.977 --> 03:04:16.722]   So they are seeking to add amendments to a 2005 accord here in the United States of America that will give The World Health Organization even more broader powers not only across the globe but in the United States of America currently and these amendments are to be negotiated on and decided by the year 2024 and according to the report it's looking they will be installed by the year 2026 as of right now but this is being pushed in our world and some of these amendments are very concerning
[03:04:17.509 --> 03:04:24.312]  One of them including a consolidation of a global health bureaucracy, including states in the United States of America.
[03:04:24.812 --> 03:04:32.755]  Each state, they want to nominate a national IHR focal point for the implementation of health measures under these regulations.
[03:04:33.235 --> 03:04:39.077]  These focal points could avail of World Health Organization capacity building and technical assistance.
[03:04:39.717 --> 03:04:49.925]  IHR focal points presumably manned by unelected bureaucrats and experts would be essentially nodes in a new World Health Organization-led global health bureaucracy.
[03:04:50.065 --> 03:05:19.163]   So some kind of World Health Organization headquarters in each state appointed by a World Health Organization individual or governor in each state that will be in total obedience, that will be the experts giving advice during a pandemic By the World Health Organization in the United States of America, unelected, not chosen, placed there by a global entity.
[03:05:19.484 --> 03:05:22.845]  We all know how 2020 went down with the World Health Organization and the CDC.
[03:05:23.245 --> 03:05:28.847]  So essentially a bunch of Dr. Fauci's in each state overriding each governor of the United States of America.
[03:05:30.396 --> 03:05:54.726]  I mean, this is what I'm telling and what InfoWars and Alex Jones has been telling the entire public for decades, how these people coordinate and they're very strategically scheming and calculated where they even geographically put people before they launch a pandemic, before they launch the kill switch, or they launch another pathogen or a bioweapon on humanity.
[03:05:55.942 --> 03:06:03.308]  And these amendments also include the World Health Organization having the ability to seize global martial law powers, essentially.
[03:06:03.328 --> 03:06:06.230]  They get to decide what a pandemic is.
[03:06:06.390 --> 03:06:08.672]  They will get to decide how long a pandemic lasts.
[03:06:08.952 --> 03:06:27.291]   And they will get to decide just exactly how that country or that civilization or that state and what measures they will take necessary according to medicine in order to thwart The spread of a virus according to the World Health Organization.
[03:06:27.391 --> 03:06:30.232]  They will seize these powers in order to be able to dictate this.
[03:06:30.793 --> 03:06:34.974]  And we know exactly what they wanted in 2020 and 2021.
[03:06:35.014 --> 03:06:39.356]  That's why I believe 2020 was a beta test of things to come.
[03:06:39.856 --> 03:06:42.017]  They will launch worse pathogens.
[03:06:42.617 --> 03:06:44.918]  They will launch worse bioweapons.
[03:06:45.518 --> 03:06:54.422]   And they will start to geographically coordinate because all of these amendments are to be discussed 2024 to be decided and fully implemented At the latest, the year 2026.
[03:06:55.523 --> 03:06:57.424]  Like I said, they operate in cycles.
[03:06:58.004 --> 03:07:00.125]  Like I said, they operate on a timeline.
[03:07:00.645 --> 03:07:08.669]  And like I said, they are strategically calculating how they are going to geographically take ground and territory before they launch these operations.
[03:07:08.709 --> 03:07:27.834]   So 2020 was a huge testing ground, not only for the CCP, but for the CDC and the World Health Organization and the globalist powers out there that will, in the name of medical health, We'll push their medical tyranny and their psycho mad scientist experiments on humans probably for the next 40 years if nothing is done.
[03:07:28.995 --> 03:07:35.603]  Not only do we have to talk about this, but some serious legislative strides and actions need to be taken immediately.
[03:07:35.623 --> 03:07:38.226]  And I would like, I mean, I don't think we're going to get it because...
[03:07:39.463 --> 03:07:51.527]  I think our government, the House just went on vacation until January, signing another hundred million billion dollar, you know, deal for every other government in the world except for us while, you know, people are struggling over Christmas.
[03:07:52.367 --> 03:08:02.471]  But I think our so-called elected officials need to seriously take a look at the World Health Organization and the CDC and the World Economic Forum and truly see them for what they really are.
[03:08:02.811 --> 03:08:03.831]  Threats to the Republic.
[03:08:06.237 --> 03:08:16.284]  Threats to humanity and threats to our God-given freedoms and an ultimate, overarching threat to the Constitution of the United States of America.
[03:08:16.524 --> 03:08:18.745]  These amendments will bypass our free rights.
[03:08:19.246 --> 03:08:40.906]   Even in these amendments, even in these amendments, they are considering even redefining and removing statements regarding that this advice should be given In the sense of free humanity or, you know, every single human being having the freedom to be able to make decisions for themselves.
[03:08:41.046 --> 03:08:41.926]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:08:42.186 --> 03:08:47.247]  And they want to remove that and replace it with all kinds of ESG, SJW talk.
[03:08:48.587 --> 03:08:52.088]  So they don't believe in the free will of humanity.
[03:08:52.108 --> 03:08:54.568]  They don't believe in the free choice of humanity.
[03:08:54.588 --> 03:08:57.749]  They don't believe in human beings making decisions for themselves.
[03:08:58.740 --> 03:09:04.346]  They don't believe in humanity making choices because what they need is a bypass of your free will.
[03:09:05.888 --> 03:09:09.071]  And at first they will attempt to do it in the name of a legislative.
[03:09:09.111 --> 03:09:13.676]  They will at first do it, attempt to do it in a name where it appears to be legal.
[03:09:14.797 --> 03:09:20.744]  At first they will attempt to do it in a way where it looks like the people chose this and they'll call it a democracy.
[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:22.940]  They'll call it a democracy.
[03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:25.621]  They say that, well, the people chose this and this is what the people want.
[03:09:25.661 --> 03:09:28.241]  When in reality, they will bypass all of that.
[03:09:28.621 --> 03:09:30.342]  They will bypass all free thought.
[03:09:30.662 --> 03:09:32.362]  They will bypass all free choice.
[03:09:33.122 --> 03:09:35.063]  And they themselves will impose this.
[03:09:35.903 --> 03:09:45.925]  And then they will have mass hysteria because when they do launch a serious pathogen, a more deadly bioweapon, they know that people will be begging for this.
[03:09:46.869 --> 03:09:48.550]  You and I, the Infowarriors, will resist.
[03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:51.512]  Put your faith in God, I'm gonna go down with the ship, dude.
[03:09:51.912 --> 03:09:53.933]  I'm not gonna die in fear, I'm not gonna live in fear.
[03:09:53.993 --> 03:09:54.674]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:09:55.194 --> 03:10:03.239]  But they know, through their fear hysteria and their propaganda, they've already tested, okay, the psyche of the public has been groomed post-2020.
[03:10:03.479 --> 03:10:04.880]  You understand that, right?
[03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:15.876]  The fear, the paranoia, the mass formation psychosis, the psyche of our world has already been primed and groomed for something worse.
[03:10:16.416 --> 03:10:17.197]  And they know that.
[03:10:17.777 --> 03:10:18.938]  And that was the beta test.
[03:10:19.578 --> 03:10:40.507]   And as this goes forward, as this continues to get more serious, as they start to launch more of their deadly biological pathogens, viruses, weapons against humanity, Well, they know that they've psychologically primed millions of people on planet Earth to live in absolutely fear and hysteria and beg.
[03:10:41.008 --> 03:10:42.048]  Beg for a way out.
[03:10:42.928 --> 03:10:45.749]  Beg for some kind of alleviance.
[03:10:45.909 --> 03:10:47.330]  Beg for some kind of relief.
[03:10:47.890 --> 03:10:49.631]  Beg for some kind of savior.
[03:10:50.011 --> 03:10:56.134]  Beg for someone to come and help them and pull them out through fear, through manipulation.
[03:10:56.234 --> 03:10:57.594]  That is the tactic.
[03:10:57.934 --> 03:11:08.721]   That is exactly The tool of war that they use, the number one tool that this New World Order will use against free humanity is fear.
[03:11:09.282 --> 03:11:10.242]  Because it's effective.
[03:11:10.583 --> 03:11:11.363]  Because it works.
[03:11:12.024 --> 03:11:16.947]  And through people's fear, and their phobia, and their paranoia, and their fear of death, ultimately.
[03:11:17.728 --> 03:11:32.106]   Their fear of death will be the number one way that they continue to control technology, the number one way they will continue to control the world of science, medical health, Politics, government, education, everything!
[03:11:32.507 --> 03:11:35.388]  Have you ever stopped to think why do they call everything a phobia?
[03:11:37.449 --> 03:11:38.810]  Why is everything Islamophobia?
[03:11:38.850 --> 03:11:40.230]  Why is everything homophobia?
[03:11:40.270 --> 03:11:41.751]  Why is everything xenophobia?
[03:11:41.791 --> 03:11:44.012]  Why is everything a phobia with these people?
[03:11:45.273 --> 03:12:03.483]   Because this satanic death cult effectively knows that operating through manipulating the psyche of the public and their conscience through fear and paranoia and the fear of death, the fear of dying, You can grab them and you can control them and get them to do anything you want.
[03:12:03.583 --> 03:12:04.843]  Sacrifice their freedoms.
[03:12:05.083 --> 03:12:07.684]  They'll sacrifice their freedoms if they believe they're gonna die.
[03:12:08.604 --> 03:12:11.485]  They'll sacrifice their children if they believe that they're gonna die.
[03:12:11.765 --> 03:12:13.245]  They'll sacrifice their world.
[03:12:13.425 --> 03:12:14.866]  They'll sacrifice their house.
[03:12:15.126 --> 03:12:16.686]  They'll sacrifice their state.
[03:12:16.926 --> 03:12:18.547]  They'll sacrifice their country.
[03:12:18.747 --> 03:12:23.548]  They will sacrifice everything if you bring them on the verge of death.
[03:12:23.628 --> 03:12:28.489]  That fear will grab them by the balls and control them forever.
[03:12:29.329 --> 03:12:30.449]  Don't let them do that to you guys.
[03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:31.230]  Stay based.
[03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:38.992]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[03:12:48.976 --> 03:12:50.877]  I've not been this excited ever!
[03:12:51.017 --> 03:12:53.498]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[03:12:53.578 --> 03:12:53.918]  Wow!
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:56.985]  The replatforming begins now!
[03:12:57.125 --> 03:13:09.425]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com I've been on air close to 30 years.
[03:13:10.245 --> 03:13:19.956]  And going back more than, wow, 15 years ago, we began to get massively censored and debanked and harassed in different ways by the globalist deep state.
[03:13:20.617 --> 03:13:28.185]  So when their total censorship and tyranny arrived, the last five years, we were ready to resist it as best as we could.
[03:13:28.846 --> 03:13:33.392]  So, Nietzsche's definitely right that that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[03:13:33.972 --> 03:13:40.292]   But really it's been God working through the audience of viewers and listeners who've been steadfast supporters,
[03:13:40.292 --> 03:13:45.731]   spreading the word, praying for us, buying the product, sharing the clips, the articles, the videos.
[03:13:45.731 --> 03:13:51.272]   This really allowed us to survive and when it comes to exposing the globalists thrive.
[03:13:51.272 --> 03:13:56.132]   So as Christmas approaches 2023, I wanted to take some time out to say that I'm thankful
[03:13:56.132 --> 03:13:58.452]  for all the viewers and listeners.
[03:13:58.452 --> 03:14:02.292]   And I meet you all over the streets of Austin and all over the country and all over the world.
[03:14:02.292 --> 03:14:04.652]  And I really love you and I appreciate you.
[03:14:04.652 --> 03:14:11.893]   And because they started taking our sponsors away from us more than 15 years ago, we began to move away from sponsors
[03:14:11.893 --> 03:14:15.893]  and sell products directly to the population.
[03:14:16.107 --> 03:14:20.249]  And we always went out and tried to find hot, cool products that already had great reviews.
[03:14:20.769 --> 03:14:22.249]  That way, we knew we were selling a good product.
[03:14:22.329 --> 03:14:23.230]  I would try them out myself.
[03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:28.832]  And over the last 15 years, we've gotten really, really good at bringing you amazing products.
[03:14:29.552 --> 03:14:38.971]   And now, we have the best books, The best films, really everything we saw on the site is very high quality, but at a very, very competitive price.
[03:14:39.371 --> 03:14:43.371]   Whether it's the storable foods, whether it's the water filtration,
[03:14:43.371 --> 03:14:46.290]   whether it's the supplements, whether it's the books, the films,
[03:14:46.290 --> 03:14:52.011]   they're amongst the very, very best and you're funding an operation fighting the globalist.
[03:14:52.011 --> 03:14:56.531]   So even if you bought this stuff at a big box store whose owners are anti-freedom, anti-human,
[03:14:56.531 --> 03:14:58.011]  you'd still be getting a great product.
[03:14:58.011 --> 03:15:02.652]   But when you buy these products from us, you are supporting an organization,
[03:15:02.652 --> 03:15:05.050]  an operation that's not submitting to tyranny.
[03:15:05.247 --> 03:15:11.691]  So we kind of created the model of a political talk show funding itself with direct sales.
[03:15:11.811 --> 03:15:15.433]  And now more and more are doing it because they've been censored, they've been shut down.
[03:15:15.513 --> 03:15:23.537]  So for all the years we've been fighting together, I want to thank all the InfoWars viewers and listeners, the InfoWars family, because we're still here because of you.
[03:15:23.957 --> 03:15:32.759]   And now, Christmas, 2023 is here, and we have the biggest sales of the year every Christmas, and a lot of products that have been sold out are now back in stock.
[03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:40.786]  I'm happy to announce we have storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 10% off when you sign up for auto ship on your next order.
[03:15:40.806 --> 03:15:44.445]   That way stuff that's sold out is held back for you, so it's not sold out.
[03:15:44.445 --> 03:15:47.765]  And up to 60% off on these best-selling products.
[03:15:47.765 --> 03:15:54.886]   And finally, TurboForce, 10 hours of clean energy is finally back in stock.
[03:15:54.886 --> 03:16:01.364]   The top of the line, the strongest, the Godzilla of nootropics of energy, of brain boost.
[03:16:01.364 --> 03:16:03.165]  TurboForce back in stock.
[03:16:03.165 --> 03:16:06.845]  X2, sold out for more than a year, got a limited supply in.
[03:16:06.845 --> 03:16:09.046]  Unfortunately, it's about to sell out.
[03:16:09.122 --> 03:16:16.026]  Despite that, we've got it at 25% off, but it's going to go to full price before Christmas hits, so take advantage of that right now.
[03:16:16.366 --> 03:16:26.272]  We also have down-and-out sleep support, a whole bunch of natural, known, strong, organic compounds that give you deep, restful sleep that's so good for your immune system, your body, everything.
[03:16:26.532 --> 03:16:30.494]  Real Red Pill Plus, Vitaminal Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:16:31.403 --> 03:16:34.586]  It's all there at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:16:34.606 --> 03:16:36.508]  You can also call toll-free.
[03:16:37.048 --> 03:16:42.934]  If you'd like to order that way, 888-253-3139.
[03:16:42.954 --> 03:16:43.154]  888-253-3139.
[03:16:43.434 --> 03:16:46.757]  But these are great products that enrich your life and they keep us on the air.
[03:16:47.057 --> 03:16:50.621]  That's why I coined the term many years ago, 360 WIN.
[03:16:50.661 --> 03:16:53.183]  This is a non-zero-sum game.
[03:16:53.463 --> 03:16:54.845]  This is beyond symbiotic.
[03:16:55.345 --> 03:16:57.227]  This doesn't just make us all okay.
[03:16:57.468 --> 03:16:58.129]  We work together.
[03:16:58.369 --> 03:17:00.011]  This empowers us all together.
[03:17:00.351 --> 03:17:03.035]  So please do your Christmas shopping at mfootworkstore.com.
[03:17:03.495 --> 03:17:04.457]  Thank you for your support.
[03:17:04.697 --> 03:17:05.158]  God bless.
