[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:04.731]  What do you have to say about young men dropping dead of heart attacks every day?
[00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.392]  How much money have you personally made off the vaccine?
[00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:10.813]  Who did you meet with here in secret?
[00:00:11.393 --> 00:00:13.374]  Why won't you answer these basic questions?
[00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:26.794]  I'm worried that they're going to try and block this video.
[00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:33.571]  This is the equivalent of a hole in one by the journalist from Rebel Media, Ezra Levant, and one of his other reporters.
[00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:35.333]  This is incredible.
[00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:36.554]  This is perfectly done.
[00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:38.436]  They bring up all the key points.
[00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:40.398]  He runs off like a scared coward.
[00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:41.119]  It is insane.
[00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:56.779]   It is the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, who got secret agreements with governments To indemnify them from any vaccine damage that came from their experimental shot, knowing full well they could then use that information to blackmail and control government because they signed on to it.
[00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:58.641]  And they destroy him.
[00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:06.583]  He is confronted for about five minutes of the six-minute clip, and he scurries behind the security line, the 5,000 troops protecting these criminals.
[00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:09.745]  This is the essence of victory.
[00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:11.106]  This is so incredible.
[00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:16.010]  And I am just honored to know Ezra Levant and his other reporters with the work they're doing.
[00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.311]  Rebel Media is just incredible.
[00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:22.574]  So it's so important to support them, also M4s as well, because this is important stuff.
[00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:23.895]  Here is the clip.
[00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:27.358]  Criminal investigations have been launched all over the world with Pfizer and Moderna.
[00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:34.402]  It's coming out that they knew it didn't protect you and erase your immune system and cause heart attacks and blood clots and everything else.
[00:01:34.882 --> 00:01:37.264]  This is an incredible moment, and this is so beautiful.
[00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.665]  This is the beginning of Nuremberg 2.
[00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.467]  Here it is, and then share it after you watch it.
[00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:48.610]  Mr. Porlick, can I ask you, when did you know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission?
[00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.312]  How long did you know that without saying it publicly?
[00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:52.433]  Thank you very much.
[00:01:52.893 --> 00:01:53.954]  Why won't you answer that question?
[00:01:54.946 --> 00:02:00.470]  I mean, we now know that the vaccines didn't stop transmission, but why did you keep it secret?
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:07.635]  You said it was 100% effective, then 90%, then 80%, then 70%.
[00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.077]  But we now know that the vaccines do not stop transmission.
[00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:12.758]  Why did you keep that secret?
[00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:14.039]  To have a nice day.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.101]  I won't have a nice day until I know the answer.
[00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:22.525]  Why did you keep it a secret that your vaccine did not stop transmission?
[00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:26.738]  Is it time to apologise to the world, sir?
[00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:33.282]  To give refunds back to the countries that poured all their money into your vaccine that doesn't work, your ineffective vaccine?
[00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:35.464]  Yeah, you have a go bear with it.
[00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:38.026]  Are you not ashamed of what you've done in the last couple of years?
[00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.147]  Do you have any apologies to the public, sir?
[00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.331]  Are you proud of it?
[00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.713]  You've made millions on the backs of people's tire livelihoods.
[00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:56.397]  How does that feel to walk the streets as a millionaire on the backs of the regular person at home in Australia, in England, in Canada?
[00:02:57.278 --> 00:02:59.339]  What do you think about on your yacht, sir?
[00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.620]  What do you think about on your private jet?
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.201]  Are you worried about product liability?
[00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:06.322]  Are you worried about myocarditis?
[00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:08.744]  What about the sudden deaths?
[00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.993]  What do you have to say about young men dropping dead of heart attacks every day?
[00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:20.556]  Why won't you answer these basic questions?
[00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:25.359]  No apologies, sir.
[00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:33.705]  Do you think you should be charged criminally for some of the criminal behavior you've obviously been a part of?
[00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:38.228]  How much money have you personally made off the vaccine?
[00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:44.609]  How many boosters do you think it'll take for you to be happy enough with your earnings?
[00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.131]  Nothing?
[00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:51.172]  Who did you meet with here in secret?
[00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:53.534]  Will you disclose who you met with?
[00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.016]  Who did you pay commissions to?
[00:03:58.596 --> 00:04:04.539]  In the past, Pfizer has paid 2.3 billion dollars in fines for deceptive marketing.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.541]  Have you engaged in that same conduct again?
[00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.774]  Are you under investigation, like you were before, for your deceptive marketing, sir?
[00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:23.860]  If any other product in the world doesn't work as promised, you get a refund.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.246]  Should you not refund to countries that laid out billions for your ineffective vaccine?
[00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:36.671]  Are you used to only sympathetic media, so you don't know how to answer any questions?
[00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:42.134]  Shame on you, sir.
[00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:42.756]  Shame on you!
[00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:47.546]  This is history happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:55.668]  We have the emails from the Twitter data dumps that Pfizer and others were actively censoring doctors and scientists and journalists, exposing them.
[00:04:55.908 --> 00:04:56.909]  They are so scared.
[00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:57.989]  They are in so much trouble.
[00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:05.711]  So again, take this video from Band.Video and Infowars.com and share it everywhere you can by email, text message, you name it.
[00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:10.313]  And we have a URL that they're not censoring yet that is ConspiracyFact.info.
[00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:11.653]  We'll also post it there.
[00:05:11.873 --> 00:05:13.254]  But share this video now.
[00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:15.956]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:21.680]  This war criminal, this Joseph Mengele 2.0 is counting on you not taking action.
[00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.161]  But I know you're gonna take action.
[00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:26.004]  We are going to bring these criminals to justice.
[00:05:26.384 --> 00:05:28.286]  That's Albert Bourla, the boss of Pfizer.
[00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.008]  His people were pushing us around a little bit.
[00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:32.988]  He's pretty fit.
[00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:34.309]  I don't reckon he's had one jab.
[00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.589]  I'm huffin' and puffin' a bit.
[00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.311]  At least I didn't have any myocarditis.
[00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:49.155]  I dare say he's shocked that in his safe space at the WEF here in Davos that he was challenged in a way that he's never to date been challenged.
[00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:49.735]  Well that's the thing.
[00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:51.136]  We're not accredited media here.
[00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:52.796]  We're on the outside of the perimeter.
[00:05:53.137 --> 00:05:57.959]  So he's only used to the softballs from CNN and MSNBC and people like that.
[00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.742]  I asked him a real question about product liability.
[00:06:02.123 --> 00:06:02.603]  No answer.
[00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:05.927]  A real question about Pfizer's past deceptive practices.
[00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:10.873]  You know, they paid the largest fine in American history to the Justice Department for deceptive marketing.
[00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:13.356]  I don't know if that's underway right now.
[00:06:13.396 --> 00:06:16.139]   I don't know if they're being investigated, but I think they should be.
[00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:20.542]  When did he know that the vaccine didn't actually stop transmission?
[00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:23.945]  I wanted to find out because surely he knew before we knew.
[00:06:24.366 --> 00:06:25.186]  Why didn't he tell us?
[00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:29.050]  I don't know, Avi, I'm really proud of that question.
[00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.951]  It was like a kind of walking scrum.
[00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:34.794]  Pfizer is connected to big media in an enormous way.
[00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.759]  I'm worried that they're going to try and block this video.
[00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:46.856]  I'm worried they're going to try and cancel it on YouTube, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Facebook, places like that.
[00:06:47.276 --> 00:06:55.682]  So I want to look straight at the camera and say, folks, if you cannot find this video out there, go to WEFReports.com.
[00:06:55.722 --> 00:06:58.844]  That's a special website we've set up for the World Economic Forum.
[00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:01.186]  WEFReports.com.
[00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:06.190]  And if you feel moved by our coverage, please consider chipping in because we're 100% crowdfunded.
[00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.171]  Obviously, we get no ad money.
[00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:09.853]  We've been completely demonetized.
[00:07:10.373 --> 00:07:15.974]  But if you like that kind of accountability journalism, Avi Yamini from Australia, I'm Ezra Levant from Canada.
[00:07:15.994 --> 00:07:17.515]  We've got a great team from around the world.
[00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:20.315]  Please go to wefreports.com.
[00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:21.316]  Last word to you, Avi.
[00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:27.077]  No matter where they cancel this video, we will update and have a current version there at wefreports.com.
[00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:30.758]  And there you can share all the content from all the guys on the ground here.
[00:07:31.298 --> 00:07:42.392]  I'm doing outstanding work and if you agree that it is as important as it and as outstanding as I think it is then please chip in a couple of dollars to help pay the cost to do this.
[00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:43.934]  Yeah, well that was a great moment.
[00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:44.855]  We'll have plenty more.
[00:07:44.694 --> 00:08:04.694]  Congrats my friend.
[00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:06.743]  So they realized in 2011 they caused it all.
[00:08:08.664 --> 00:08:47.278]   So we're in 2009 and when our paper came out they realized that these were the the shots were associated strongly very strongly the chance of them not being association it was like being struck by lightning one in at least a million in a p-value and so they covered this all up because of course they were liable now because for the four 42 million Americans who are asymptomatic carriers of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 and other XMRVs, other manufactured mouse, monkey and human viruses.
[00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:53.702]  The game was premeditated murder of the 42 million people you're liable for their injury.
[00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:55.853]  Premeditated murder.
[00:08:56.074 --> 00:09:03.780]  If you give somebody who already has an antibody a shot, you will get antibody-dependent enhancement.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.425]  Oh, so they were getting rid of the people they'd already poisoned knowing that giving them a second or third or fourth dose would kill them.
[00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:09.826]  Wow.
[00:09:10.806 --> 00:09:11.567]  Correct.
[00:09:11.687 --> 00:09:12.188]  Kill us.
[00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:13.469]  Cremate us.
[00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:22.905]  Add a mask, add a mask and isolation and you'll blame the people for COPD or any of the other co-diseases.
[00:09:23.225 --> 00:09:27.548]  You never inject an HIV positive person with any vaccine.
[00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:29.069]  We never did.
[00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:30.910]  Never until now.
[00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:36.454]  You do not drive the disease causing entity through their body.
[00:09:37.134 --> 00:09:41.856]  All over the world, the people that have had the COVID vaccine are testing positive for HIV.
[00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:44.197]  Is that because the spike protein's from HIV?
[00:09:45.258 --> 00:09:48.759]  It has GP120, glycoprotein 120, absolutely.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.922]  It also has the monkey, mouse, and manufactured XMRV.
[00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:59.044]  So the spike protein is killing, you know, literally the 12%.
[00:09:59.905 --> 00:10:04.907]  So you're saying it's a binary weapon where they already are preloaded with it and this triggers the next phase?
[00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.610]  Correct.
[00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:20.974]  And the more vaccines you got, especially Gardasil, because that has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot.
[00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:29.336]  Prior to the COVID shot, the deadliest vaccine, we saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down, all the things.
[00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:30.937]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[00:10:32.748 --> 00:10:36.970]  Um, because they operate at oxygen max, um, capacity max.
[00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.191]  They're, they're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:45.793]  This is an energy production, oxygen, um, necessary disease.
[00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:48.174]  So they create, that's what they're finding.
[00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:49.554]  They turbocharge the blood clots.
[00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:50.955]  Correct.
[00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:51.415]  Wow.
[00:10:52.728 --> 00:10:52.988]  Yep.
[00:10:53.008 --> 00:10:54.649]  And ischemia, lack of oxygen.
[00:10:55.289 --> 00:11:12.754]  So constricted blood vessels too because athletes are running, they're constricted, they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:19.436]  It dissolves under the tongue, gives you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:23.720]  You looked at our nitric oxide, I saw it was the top rated, they let us private label it, it's the best seller.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.581]  You've looked at our formula, you like it?
[00:11:25.822 --> 00:11:27.203]  I did and I do, yes.
[00:11:27.743 --> 00:11:31.627]  I'm not a scientist like you, what do these compounds do creating nitric oxide, what does it do?
[00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:36.692]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[00:11:37.052 --> 00:11:40.175]  It allows it to relax, it lowers the blood pressure.
