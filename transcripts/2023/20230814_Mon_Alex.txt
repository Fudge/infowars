[00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:05.464]  Here we are again in the arena.
[00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:07.045]  Prepare for battle.
[00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:09.667]  It's Monday, August 14th, 2023.
[00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.109]  Tell everybody you know to tune in now.
[00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.972]  It's an InfoWar.
[00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:17.353]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:20.135]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:28.675]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:38.940]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.384]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:56.109]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:04.574]  Well, I gotta talk about a new hire that the crew hired about three months ago without asking me.
[00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:07.376]  And you'd think you couldn't hire somebody here without asking me, but I'm like,
[00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:10.548]  Who's this Chase Geyser guy in the office?
[00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:12.109]  I'd seen him before online.
[00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.050]  Also the stuff I like.
[00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.411]  I did not hire him.
[00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.172]  And they go, you're in bankruptcy.
[00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:18.713]  The CRO hired him.
[00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:21.475]  And that's something good that Pat McGill did.
[00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:23.416]  And the guy just knocks it out of the park.
[00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.297]  And he's a great talk show host as well.
[00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:28.059]  Right up there with Harrison Smith and Owen Shore.
[00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:29.059]  We love him to death.
[00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:33.082]  And I've gotten to be pretty good friends with him since he's been here.
[00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:34.563]  We fire and forget here on air.
[00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:36.826]  And we'll play that clip.
[00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:39.127]  We just played one more time here in a moment.
[00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:40.348]  So I talk about stuff.
[00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:41.009]  I see things.
[00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.491]  I give you my take on it.
[00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:48.454]  And then up until just about five, six years ago, we wouldn't even write notes about the show.
[00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:49.715]  Now we have folks do a log.
[00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:53.618]  When I talk about a particular topic or a particular guest, they'll put a note.
[00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:54.639]  So we try to search it later.
[00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:57.238]  Find it.
[00:01:57.238 --> 00:02:01.019]  But we've done so many tens of thousands of shows, there's no way to keep track of it.
[00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:15.924]  Well, Chase Geyser has been ferreting around online and found archives and online reservoirs, depositories of my older shows.
[00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:19.925]  And they have found the March shows and the July shows.
[00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:32.738]  Where I go through everything, how they're going to fly jets in the World Trade Center, how they're going to bring in tyranny, how they're going to pass a Patriot Act.
[00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:33.778]  It's just incredible.
[00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:39.481]  So you just heard a few seconds from that March broadcast 22 years ago.
[00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:45.883]  22 years ago, and we have the whole broadcast.
[00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.360]  Now, it takes crew and energy and people.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.805]  It's one thing to find it and get the clips, another to start re-uploading these, where they can be found for everybody at Band.Video.
[00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:08.651]  So, really, really, really, really great job, because we had no way, other than it would have been uploaded to PrisonPlanet.TV, and that was just part of our work, until this guy started ferreting around.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.183]  And he says he's just struck mother loads of information.
[00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:18.286]  Because people listen to me now and they go, okay, this guy they say is right about a lot of stuff.
[00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:29.235]  But when we play them clips of me 25 years ago, they're finding clips that old.
[00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:37.382]  Saying that the transgender movement, the sex change movement is what it was called then, is about transhumanism and destroying the family.
[00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:39.763]  It's going to blow people away.
[00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:45.810]  Now, that's not our main topics, obviously, here, and I'm loaded for bear, super prepared for this broadcast.
[00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.991]  I've really got to cover all this news.
[00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:53.872]  So we're going to have a lot of news and analysis and some phone calls later in the transmission.
[00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:57.554]  I've cleared the deck of guests, except one guest that's popping in the last 30 minutes.
[00:03:57.554 --> 00:04:05.877]  The broadcast I'll tell you about later, but here's the little promo clip, and I love what he said, because I came up with tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:09.478]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today, but he came up with a line even more powerful.
[00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:18.881]  While the rest of the controlled corporate media lies about today's news, we tell you the truth about what's coming next.
[00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:19.701]  I mean, he put it even better.
[00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:20.661]  Here it is.
[00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:28.163]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:38.446]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:45.860]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.565]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:54.847]  All right.
[00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:57.348]  So we'll be right back.
[00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:57.769]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:09.532]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:15.014]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:19.956]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:26.185]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:31.833]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:05:33.723 --> 00:05:42.588]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:47.371]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:52.514]  Get your essential Omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:55.555]  Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.776]  Get some today at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:16.180]  Today, on this Monday, August 14th transmission, I'm going to reveal who runs the New World Order, who's in control of the top of the pyramid, their plans for you and your family, and how to stop them.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.301]  InfoWars.
[00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.482]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:21.284]  Today.
[00:06:21.284 --> 00:06:29.049]  Science is replacing evolution by natural selection with evolution by intelligent design.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.707]  Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds, but our intelligent design.
[00:06:36.707 --> 00:06:46.937]  The emergence of a new upgraded elite of superhumans, enhanced by bioengineering and brain-computer interfaces and things like that.
[00:06:46.937 --> 00:06:48.739]  Science may enable life
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:07:01.743]  After being confined for four billion years to the limited realm of organic compounds, science may enable life to break out into the inorganic realm.
[00:07:01.743 --> 00:07:05.564]  Here's Harari saying, we're gonna make aliens on Earth.
[00:07:05.564 --> 00:07:10.425]  We're gonna merge the machines and be a new life form, a new ruling alien class on Earth.
[00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:11.966]  See, they're building the aliens.
[00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:15.468]  The biomedical AI merger with our flesh.
[00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.069]  The raping of humanity.
[00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.410]  It's the same story from Roswell in the late 40s.
[00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.273]  With Colonel Corso, heavily promoted everywhere by the biggest publishers, by the biggest movie makers.
[00:07:24.273 --> 00:07:25.995]  That was system funded.
[00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:29.677]  Because they don't want you to understand the full spectrum of interdimensional contact.
[00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:31.778]  And the fact that it's always been here.
[00:07:31.778 --> 00:07:33.399]  These things actually aren't alien.
[00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.080]  They're part of our existence and part of our story here.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.801]  If anything's the aliens, it's us.
[00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:39.322]  But here on this planet, by God.
[00:07:39.322 --> 00:07:41.443]  And there's these things that were already basically here.
[00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:43.684]  We've probably not been here as long as this thing's been here.
[00:07:43.684 --> 00:07:45.325]  If you really read the ancient text of the Bible.
[00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:48.947]  So they don't want you to know it's far more complex and they're not in control of it.
[00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:55.250]  All they're doing is being demonically inspired by these creatures that will only give them Hellraiser visions.
[00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.532]  It will only give them how to have technology for evil because it doesn't like us.
[00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:04.316]  This is just a training camp where our father has put us here.
[00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:16.927]  We think we're only living on one life so that we're in this super scared position but having all these spiritual and ancestral intergalactic interdimensional memories and it's all a giant three-dimensional real scenario war game.
[00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:18.927]  And they don't want you to know that.
[00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:21.388]  And they don't want you to understand, they signed on to the wrong team.
[00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:28.270]  They joined with the destructive force, the evil force, so they could have power during this, the third dimensional simulation?
[00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.770]  It's a three-dimensional, genetic, universal simulation.
[00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.091]  It's a real simulation.
[00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:34.531]  It's just that it's forever war.
[00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:36.231]  You don't die when you die, folks.
[00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:39.212]  You're an electrochemical, multi-dimensional creature.
[00:08:39.212 --> 00:08:42.133]  This is only one lowest manifestation of you.
[00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:43.573]  You have glorified heavenly bodies.
[00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:45.974]  There's this first heaven, the second heaven, the third heaven.
[00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:46.834]  It's all right.
[00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:48.015]  We're good to go.
[00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:09.364]  The aliens are harassing our troops.
[00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:12.324]  No, that's the globalists with their advanced technology playing games.
[00:09:12.324 --> 00:09:17.846]  So they can brand contact with the angels and God as the devil.
[00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:19.606]  When really, we're here with the devil.
[00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:22.447]  We're not locked in with the devil, the devil's locked in with us.
[00:09:22.447 --> 00:09:31.730]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.630]  Monday Live!
[00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:53.178]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live August 14th, 2023 transmission.
[00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:55.280]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.523]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours live.
[00:09:58.523 --> 00:10:06.450]  Ahead of the mighty, intrepid Owen Schroyer.
[00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.531]  Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:17.684]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to reveal who controls the New World Order, what their goals are, and how to stop them.
[00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:22.106]  And some very good things are happening.
[00:10:22.106 --> 00:10:25.927]  It's accelerated the awakening all over the planet.
[00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:34.811]  Presidents, prime ministers, top legislators, senators, media leaders,
[00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.490]  All the main dominant media personalities are now anti-globalist.
[00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.430]  Want me to list them for you?
[00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:46.171]  Do I need to?
[00:10:46.171 --> 00:11:01.074]  How global banks, through BlackRock, through a few other organizations, are creating crises to destabilize and collapse civilization and consolidate power and control to then carry out their transhumanist endgame.
[00:11:03.087 --> 00:11:09.289]  And more and more scientists, I mean, by the hundreds of thousands, nurses, doctors, scientists are going public.
[00:11:09.289 --> 00:11:18.211]  Nobel Prize winners, by the dozen, that's conservative, are coming out against the poison shots, against the fake global warming, climate change power grab.
[00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:23.133]  It is an amazing time to be alive, but the enemy is throwing everything they've got at us.
[00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:23.973]  I'm going to cover that.
[00:11:24.858 --> 00:11:35.121]  Coming up in about 21 minutes from now, when we come out of break at 33 after, we are going to hit all of this and lay it out.
[00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:44.304]  Remember, the enemy is fighting around the clock to keep this information from getting to the public, because if they get this information, it's game over for the New World Order.
[00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.105]  They say the world as we know it ends in 20...
[00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.351]  30.
[00:11:48.351 --> 00:12:03.142]  They say billions are going to die because the Earth's warming and we're bad, but they're the ones cutting off the energy, cutting off the food, funding the civil unrest, cutting off the police, starting the wars, funding the social unrest groups.
[00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:14.071]  So, in the interim, let me tell you what is on the plate other than that, and I will cover that in the last 30 minutes of this hour, then I will cover all this other news,
[00:12:16.263 --> 00:12:18.945]  And take your phone calls.
[00:12:18.945 --> 00:12:23.388]  Senator Cruz says it's time for Biden impeachment hearings.
[00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:28.311]  CNN, Trump lawyers receive written invitation to inspect Georgia voting machines.
[00:12:28.311 --> 00:12:30.912]  What's the first rule of the State Department that elections free and open?
[00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:33.454]  That you're allowed to inspect, you're allowed to investigate.
[00:12:33.454 --> 00:12:43.000]  That's reportedly just one of the new indictments coming out of Georgia as the world braces for the fourth kangaroo indictment.
[00:12:44.707 --> 00:12:59.012]  Then, all causes of mortality up a whopping 45% in 0-24 age group since COVID-Vax rollout, CDC data shows, and a whole stack of news on the poison shot area.
[00:12:59.012 --> 00:13:13.257]  Then, the left this weekend had their pedo pride event, where they paraded hundreds of small children in front of them as their metaphoric captors.
[00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:15.668]  We'll be going through that.
[00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:21.732]  Skittles are the latest bud light after releasing trans BLM packaging for children.
[00:13:21.732 --> 00:13:30.099]  Remember when they caught the tobacco companies covertly funding candy companies with candy cigarettes?
[00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:35.923]  And that's what they're doing here, but with something far more insidious.
[00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:42.248]  That ties into the Chinese communists openly funding anti-family messages on TikTok.
[00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:52.103]  And we'll also get into all these people coming forward saying, yeah, they had gay sex with Barack Obama.
[00:13:52.103 --> 00:13:56.204]  And the issue here is Barack Obama is blackmailed.
[00:13:56.204 --> 00:13:59.626]  Barack Obama is controlled.
[00:13:59.626 --> 00:14:03.848]  And we don't hate Barack Obama because he's married to Big Mike or that he's, quote, gay.
[00:14:03.848 --> 00:14:05.388]  At least I don't.
[00:14:05.388 --> 00:14:09.450]  I hate him because he's pushing it all on our children and it's pedophilic.
[00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:19.009]  Chrissy Teigen reveals best place she and her husband John Legend had sex was with the Obama thing.
[00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:24.293]  And of course Obama saying how he fantasizes daily about sex with men.
[00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:27.876]  Trying to see if his girlfriend was into that.
[00:14:27.876 --> 00:14:32.760]  We've got big Ukraine news about the Ukrainian women party on the beaches.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.721]  Their men died.
[00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:42.507]  More on the Georgia prosecutors have messages showing Trump team is behind voting machine breach.
[00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:58.439]  I already mentioned that but it ties into the fact that they were simply invited in to be able to check and see and now in Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona they have found all the votes showing Trump won.
[00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:03.402]  They found the dead people, the illegals voting in numbers that would have made Trump win.
[00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:03.843]  We have that
[00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.350]  Big news.
[00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:25.714]  And of course we have the huge developments in New York that have really hit a crescendo as hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens just in New York State alone arrive and litter the streets and hotels with the government spending tens of millions, twenty million just in one city alone a month to house them.
[00:15:25.714 --> 00:15:29.274]  Ten thousand for every quote migrant.
[00:15:29.274 --> 00:15:32.335]  All the homeless are everywhere and they throw people out of the hospital.
[00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.635]  On stretchers, onto the street, we have video of all of that.
[00:15:38.635 --> 00:15:45.922]  Also, more news on Bill Gates obsessed with ticks that give you beef allergies as the cover for what's actually in the vaccine.
[00:15:45.922 --> 00:15:50.346]  Bill Gates' lab-grown meat causes cancer in humans.
[00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:54.491]  Biden regime to spend $1.2 billion to vacuum carbon dioxide from the sky.
[00:15:56.138 --> 00:16:04.881]  Chinese military has figured out how to build a laser that doesn't ever overheat, and that ties into the majority of people.
[00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:14.645]  I've seen polls on Twitter believing lasers are causing the mysterious out-of-control fires in Maui and key real estate areas.
[00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:19.487]  I actually have the rest of the story on that and know what's really going on.
[00:16:19.487 --> 00:16:19.927]  And of course,
[00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:30.115]  There have been a lot of experts that have been exposing the fact that they don't need a billion-dollar laser in space to set fires.
[00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:34.976]  They need a one-dollar lighter.
[00:16:34.976 --> 00:16:35.836]  Fire.
[00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:45.138]  And with that, when a hurricane hits and there's high winds, you can light fires in the brush.
[00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:47.479]  In Hawaii, especially Maui and Kona,
[00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:52.937]  I've been to both many times, love it, since I was a kid.
[00:16:52.937 --> 00:16:54.418]  You think they're very jungly.
[00:16:54.418 --> 00:16:58.439]  They're only jungly in some of the mountains and on the coast.
[00:16:58.439 --> 00:17:12.263]  But Maui and Kona, the big island, when you fly over them in a helicopter, are like a desert with mountain goats all over it, scrub brush everywhere, and the volcanic soil.
[00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:17.105]  And so when you get 70 mile an hour winds and somebody starts fires,
[00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:20.837]  The fire then burns.
[00:17:20.837 --> 00:17:44.431]  One person in about two hours with a can of gasoline in those 60, 70 mile an hour winds when that hurricane hit could have simply lit the fires ahead of the town as the wind blows across it and it creates a bellows effect or an oxidization effect and then vaporizes everything.
[00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:45.192]  So you don't need
[00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:55.970]  Billion dollar lasers when you've got 75 cents or a buck quarter lighters.
[00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.253]  That is Promethean fire.
[00:18:01.253 --> 00:18:13.581]  I know it's sexy to say it's lasers, but when the Chinese fired lasers a year ago in a mapping operation, a topography laser, you could see it because there's so much
[00:18:14.708 --> 00:18:22.935]  Water in the atmosphere, and I've studied this and had Star Wars former head on, Dr. Bob Bowman and many others before he died.
[00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:32.143]  Unless you're the clearest day ever, you try to fire a laser from space, it can shoot stuff at 30, 40, 50,000 feet because there's very little water vapor there.
[00:18:33.183 --> 00:18:41.786]  But once you start shooting deeper, there's on average about 10 to 12 feet of water between 30,000 feet and sea level.
[00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:43.907]  There's about an inch of dust and dirt.
[00:18:43.907 --> 00:18:48.049]  If you combine it all together, it's equivalent to having a laser trying to shoot through a rock.
[00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:51.790]  And I've read all the different Star Wars reports and information.
[00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.071]  It doesn't work.
[00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:58.733]  Like, notice the Chinese lasers and that footage we're showing right now of your TV viewer.
[00:18:58.733 --> 00:19:01.214]  As soon as it tries to get to the ground, look how weak it gets.
[00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:21.310]  Before the topography laser that's doing a scan and reading the map of the earth for a map, and what the Chinese have is Tinker Toys compared to what the quote US government has, notice how by the time it hits the ground it barely even is able to get a reading because it's shooting through water vapor.
[00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:26.326]  You don't need to shoot their water vapor.
[00:19:26.326 --> 00:19:33.288]  You wait till the wind is high, and they've busted Antifa and leftists all over the world.
[00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:37.029]  Big fires in France right now, big fires in Germany.
[00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:52.333]  When the winds get high and it's dry, out come the Extinction Rebellion leftists, and they don't like populists, they don't like people having houses, they don't like people having cars, and then obviously the globalists,
[00:19:53.536 --> 00:19:59.837]  This came out with a lot of the experts that exposed it a few years ago during the 2000 summer riots.
[00:19:59.837 --> 00:20:07.679]  Antifa directed the hordes and crowds of what to burn and what to attack, and they specifically attacked the real estate in different parts of the U.S.
[00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:09.579]  that the globalists wanted.
[00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:17.580]  So I believe arsonists did set these fires, and we have evidence, we'll cover next hour of that, and people being arrested for it.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.961]  And they basically had the utility companies and others
[00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:23.670]  Keep the power on that would make it even more explosive.
[00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:30.453]  They had emergency crews stand back and only protect elitist properties with the fire departments.
[00:20:30.453 --> 00:20:37.115]  So this is staged, but it wasn't done with a laser.
[00:20:37.115 --> 00:20:39.977]  Even though that's sexy and fun to talk about.
[00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:45.719]  It was done with a lighter or matches and gasoline.
[00:20:45.719 --> 00:20:48.040]  You can bet your bottom dollar on
[00:20:51.687 --> 00:21:07.434]  And I'm not into arson, and I'm not a pyromaniac, but even if the globalists took all our guns, went to a physical civil war, you can take all the guns you want with a double-edged dagger or a hammer, and you can burn down whatever you want with a can of gasoline and a lighter.
[00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.275]  We're not doing that.
[00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:15.037]  But the left, they've been caught all over the country.
[00:21:15.037 --> 00:21:17.158]  And you know what the big tell is of hundreds?
[00:21:17.158 --> 00:21:19.499]  You know why I know?
[00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:19.899]  Patterns.
[00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:24.217]  No, I know they were going to blow up the World Trade Center with jumbo jets.
[00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:26.058]  They were wargaming it.
[00:21:26.058 --> 00:21:33.282]  They had the Pentagon cancel a trip a week before to New York, and the list goes on and on.
[00:21:33.282 --> 00:21:35.183]  You know how I know?
[00:21:35.183 --> 00:21:48.169]  In the 2000 election, in the six months before the election, they arrested hundreds of leftist anti-FUD environmentalists all over the United States, but particularly on the West Coast, during the high winds that summer.
[00:21:49.636 --> 00:21:57.199]  Police arrested 14, I pulled the article up this morning, in two days in Northern California, because the cops knew what to look for.
[00:21:57.199 --> 00:22:03.782]  They were shooting around on back roads, they were looking at the wind, what was hitting neighborhoods, and they knew people were setting them.
[00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:11.005]  The fire department told them, clearly these are all being set right by neighborhoods, right in the direction of the wind.
[00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:14.906]  So the police just raced around, and the fire department raced around.
[00:22:14.906 --> 00:22:16.307]  There's a lot of good men and women still left.
[00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:24.299]  And they asked shopkeepers and auto mechanics and others to help them.
[00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:36.284]  They raced around in their trucks and their cars on the back roads, right outside towns, again, on the back side, on the front side of the wind, knowing which way you'd set a fire.
[00:22:36.284 --> 00:22:46.528]  And they caught, in just one day, 14 Antifa and leftist environmentalists setting fires.
[00:22:46.528 --> 00:22:46.948]  Remember that?
[00:22:47.867 --> 00:23:01.514]  And I have a friend that lives in Northern California who's a firefighter who agreed with me and said that they were aware of that and they arrested in his county scores of people as well during those months.
[00:23:01.514 --> 00:23:07.957]  So all you gotta do is look, okay, the wind's blowing to the east, it's 40 miles an hour, it's dry.
[00:23:07.957 --> 00:23:14.361]  We just gotta get in the scrub brush and the trees and the grass on the outside of town
[00:23:16.189 --> 00:23:18.831]  Where arsonists would set the fires.
[00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:22.833]  And sure enough... There they are!
[00:23:22.833 --> 00:23:30.478]  Setting the fires with the cans of gas and their lighters.
[00:23:30.478 --> 00:23:34.460]  Un... Oh yeah, 14th... Oh, you guys found it.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.744]  14th arson suspect arrested.
[00:23:39.744 --> 00:23:41.745]  That's in a whole other spate of, uh...
[00:23:44.403 --> 00:23:50.586]  And they're all Antifa or professors or leftists or an Extinction Rebellion.
[00:23:50.586 --> 00:23:51.447]  We got good cops.
[00:23:51.447 --> 00:23:52.407]  We got good firefighters.
[00:23:52.407 --> 00:23:54.248]  They're out there.
[00:23:54.248 --> 00:23:56.229]  But here was the big tell.
[00:23:56.229 --> 00:23:57.429]  Not that we arrested all those people.
[00:23:57.429 --> 00:23:58.290]  That was a big tell.
[00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.051]  That was a big piece of evidence.
[00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:01.271]  That's enough to know it's them.
[00:24:01.271 --> 00:24:04.453]  It's part of the Globalist program, part of the larger operation.
[00:24:04.453 --> 00:24:11.436]  They got their Antifa and their other leftist groups like Extinction Rebellion blocking roads, blocking tracks, doing stuff everywhere.
[00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:12.817]  Antifa derailing trains everywhere.
[00:24:14.573 --> 00:24:20.397]  Probably a hundred arrests, that's a guesstimation, of antifa around the country derailing trains always gets shut down.
[00:24:20.397 --> 00:24:21.718]  That's the key.
[00:24:21.718 --> 00:24:30.205]  When we reported that in July, August, September, and October of 2020.
[00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:36.650]  Hey, look, five arrested here, three arrested here, two arrested here, 14 arrested here in one day.
[00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:42.575]  In California, in Oregon, in Washington State, in other areas on the West Coast.
[00:24:44.884 --> 00:25:01.321]  When we reported that, the national controlled corporate media attacked us and Snopes attacked and says there is no arsonist being arrested.
[00:25:01.321 --> 00:25:05.425]  So you see towns going up all over Northern California, towns all over Southern California going up.
[00:25:06.394 --> 00:25:10.555]  And the police get in there with the firefighters, and the fire marshal, and they go, let's get the maps out.
[00:25:10.555 --> 00:25:13.876]  And they get the Google Maps out, and they look, OK, wind's coming in this way.
[00:25:13.876 --> 00:25:15.416]  They've already burned all these towns.
[00:25:15.416 --> 00:25:17.197]  We think they're probably hit right here.
[00:25:17.197 --> 00:25:19.057]  You can see they're moving in a pattern.
[00:25:19.057 --> 00:25:25.339]  All right, let's put the deputies and whoever else, because these emergencies, they got their buddies and stuff to go out there, too.
[00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:27.719]  That's a little secret that they never outlawed, the posse.
[00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:30.300]  They tried to get rid of it, but there's little secret posses.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.441]  Get every man and woman you can in these areas on radios, on their phones,
[00:25:36.328 --> 00:25:39.110]  And if I got a guess, there's a state park here, a national park here.
[00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.272]  It's probably a Lepus Park Ranger.
[00:25:41.272 --> 00:25:43.354]  They busted some of those.
[00:25:43.354 --> 00:25:45.495]  Set up in these areas with binoculars.
[00:25:45.495 --> 00:25:46.656]  Watch the cars going in.
[00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:50.379]  Get all the plates so we can run them and get ready for fires.
[00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:51.960]  And then they're sitting there five hours.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.123]  Okay, got smoke about a mile away.
[00:25:55.123 --> 00:25:56.124]  It's up there on the ridge.
[00:25:57.475 --> 00:25:59.216]  All right, how many cars you got coming in here?
[00:25:59.216 --> 00:26:03.037]  We got about 15 cars in the last four or five hours coming in, sir.
[00:26:03.037 --> 00:26:04.178]  All right, run their plates.
[00:26:04.178 --> 00:26:06.599]  I'm gonna shut up here on the roads.
[00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:08.440]  Only one road coming out.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:18.284]  You just block the road, you just walk right over, and the little bastards have the can of gas tank in their glove compartment or in their trunk or in their back seat.
[00:26:18.284 --> 00:26:19.345]  You know what?
[00:26:19.345 --> 00:26:20.425]  You're in a suspicious area.
[00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:21.306]  I got probable cause.
[00:26:21.306 --> 00:26:21.986]  Get out of the car.
[00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:28.348]  And these little bastards are so arrogant because they want to go back and show what they did.
[00:26:28.348 --> 00:26:34.293]  It's like they take photos at the mailing boxes where they're putting 50, 20, 30 ballots in.
[00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:42.559]  Almost every case these sons of bitches have photographed and videotaped themselves setting the fires.
[00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:44.601]  Then it gets worse.
[00:26:44.601 --> 00:26:46.442]  The leftist judges are in control.
[00:26:46.442 --> 00:26:47.303]  And you know what happens?
[00:26:47.303 --> 00:26:49.945]  They let almost all of them off and none of that evidence comes in.
[00:26:54.514 --> 00:27:03.401]  I told you coming up I'm going to do a deep dive on the New World Order and who runs and controls it, but I could go for 10 hours on these arsonists and their weapon.
[00:27:03.401 --> 00:27:06.203]  This is how the North beat the South.
[00:27:06.203 --> 00:27:09.365]  They couldn't beat the South until they burned everything down.
[00:27:09.365 --> 00:27:14.930]  The towns, the villages, the cities, the fields.
[00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.812]  And they did it with Flint.
[00:27:17.812 --> 00:27:19.493]  They didn't have lighters back then like this.
[00:27:19.493 --> 00:27:23.016]  I guess they had some at that point, but the point is,
[00:27:24.744 --> 00:27:27.605]  This is war, boys and girls.
[00:27:27.605 --> 00:27:30.707]  W-A-R, all capital.
[00:27:30.707 --> 00:27:32.648]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:27:32.648 --> 00:27:38.751]  Please remember, you're not gonna get game-changing, world-changing information without funding.
[00:27:38.751 --> 00:27:42.573]  And we are accelerating our operations, intensifying our operations.
[00:27:42.573 --> 00:27:44.734]  Plus, we got products you need.
[00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:46.795]  Everybody should be on Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:27:46.795 --> 00:27:51.717]  All organic, high-end vitamins, minerals, amino acids, everything you need, essentially.
[00:27:53.735 --> 00:27:55.135]  Tastes great.
[00:27:55.135 --> 00:27:56.556]  Super strong.
[00:27:56.556 --> 00:27:57.856]  Funds the operation.
[00:27:57.856 --> 00:28:00.957]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:28:00.957 --> 00:28:05.318]  3,000 milligrams CBD oil for your neurological systems in your body and your joints, your bones.
[00:28:05.318 --> 00:28:07.819]  If you haven't tried it, you should be on it.
[00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:09.999]  Doesn't get you high, doesn't make you tired.
[00:28:09.999 --> 00:28:10.819]  Just makes you clear.
[00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:11.860]  I'm on it right now.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.101]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:28:15.101 --> 00:28:15.981]  Nitric boost.
[00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:17.001]  Cleans out your blood.

[00:32:03.665 --> 00:32:08.887]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullwhorestore.com.
[00:32:08.887 --> 00:32:21.230]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.391]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:32:25.231 --> 00:32:38.239]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:40.560]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.623]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve
[00:32:45.103 --> 00:32:45.784]  We're good to go.
[00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.374]  InfoWars.
[00:33:26.374 --> 00:33:27.555]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:33:27.555 --> 00:33:27.936]  Today.
[00:33:30.211 --> 00:33:37.713]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:47.996]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:33:48.816 --> 00:33:55.378]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:33:55.378 --> 00:34:01.400]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:07.662]  God has given us an intelligence to be interfaced with this incredible discernment.
[00:34:07.662 --> 00:34:16.225]  His omnipresent power can override any AI system Satan will ever create.
[00:34:16.225 --> 00:34:16.605]  I have it.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.361]  All of you have it.
[00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:22.084]  You only have to tap into it.
[00:34:22.084 --> 00:34:28.609]  It's time to get on your knees and ask for the Holy Spirit to lead God and direct you.
[00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:30.270]  Or be destroyed.
[00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.231]  The choice is yours.
[00:34:40.396 --> 00:34:47.867]  Den Blicken Himmel fragst du dann, warum man sie nicht sehen kann.
[00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:14.744]  Civilization selectively is under attack.
[00:35:14.744 --> 00:35:25.111]  Leftist Extinction Rebellion forces funded by the New World Order are setting fires all over the natural world, destroying food plants and other vital infrastructure.
[00:35:25.111 --> 00:35:35.318]  The New World Order turned off much of the third world for over two years, causing a giant refugee crisis and mass starvation.
[00:35:35.318 --> 00:35:39.501]  While always exempting themselves and consolidating power and doubling and tripling their profits.
[00:35:41.499 --> 00:35:43.580]  This is the New World Order.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.602]  A post-industrial world for you and I, not for them.
[00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:51.985]  All right.
[00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:56.027]  What I'm about to cover is not new, but there's new information.
[00:35:56.027 --> 00:35:57.307]  A new layer.
[00:35:57.307 --> 00:36:09.734]  But one of the most popular accusations against myself and against anyone else exposing the global corporate ruling psychotic transhumanist eugenicist control freak mad scientist elite
[00:36:12.429 --> 00:36:15.830]  Is that, well, tell us who runs it!
[00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.530]  Well, we have.
[00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:32.893]  We've broke down exactly who the three power blocks are on the planet, and the sub-blocks, and it's in all their major papers and C-SPAN reports and Davos World Government Summits, it's all right there.
[00:36:32.893 --> 00:36:38.314]  When I first was waking up, 40 years ago and getting on air 29 years ago,
[00:36:41.508 --> 00:36:48.352]  I was reading books and articles quoting the David Rockefellers of the world and their plan.
[00:36:48.352 --> 00:36:52.095]  So let me give you a brief history in case you just crawled out from under a rock.
[00:36:52.095 --> 00:36:57.959]  I know most listeners will go, we already know this on your own research.
[00:36:57.959 --> 00:37:02.342]  And then I'll get into the latest developments.
[00:37:02.342 --> 00:37:07.485]  But here's what's happened.
[00:37:07.485 --> 00:37:08.906]  You had the British Empire.
[00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:19.724]  You have the European empires, mainly the Saxe-Coburg-Govas that were left, interbred with the British elite, that were the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:27.231]  You have the British Empire, the European elite, and the Russians.
[00:37:27.231 --> 00:37:32.897]  And the Russian Empire, also the same genetic bloodline as the European royalty and the British royalty.
[00:37:34.594 --> 00:37:38.196]  All hailing from Transylvania and glad the Impaler can't make that up.
[00:37:38.196 --> 00:37:42.357]  Look up, the British monarchy hails its original roots as Count Dracula.
[00:37:42.357 --> 00:37:43.778]  I mean, you just can't make up the weirdness.
[00:37:43.778 --> 00:37:45.499]  I'm not just saying that to sound weird.
[00:37:45.499 --> 00:37:48.980]  That's where you get Bram Stoker and all that.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:38:03.807]  So, by World War I, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, not through conquest, not through military, but through science and technology, was supplanting the British Empire, the Russian Empire,
[00:38:07.264 --> 00:38:27.257]  But there was a wild card, the United States of America, that had begun with the Spanish-American War in 1898, with the sinking of the main in Havana Harbor as a false flag, was beginning to expand in the Pacific Ocean in coaling stations, and was beginning to take over.
[00:38:27.257 --> 00:38:35.242]  That triggered the Japanese to become upset, and you know what happened to Pearl Harbor.
[00:38:35.242 --> 00:38:36.503]  She had some lesser players.
[00:38:37.853 --> 00:38:38.793]  Until then, the U.S.
[00:38:38.793 --> 00:38:39.714]  was a lesser player.
[00:38:39.714 --> 00:38:43.615]  Japan was a super junior lesser player.
[00:38:43.615 --> 00:38:49.536]  China had been dominated by the European elites and divided into a bunch of different sectors.
[00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:54.457]  It had not yet been reconstituted as it was by the CIA and the Communist Party in 1947.
[00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:58.258]  And Communist China comes in later.
[00:38:58.258 --> 00:39:04.680]  So, at the end of World War I, in 1918, you have a defeated Austrian-Hungarian Empire
[00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:15.381]  You have an exhausted, debilitated, wrecked, millions-dead British Empire, and you have the United States coming forward as the new dominant force.
[00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:22.164]  You have the Tsars and their empire collapsing, and the Bolshevik Revolution funded by British intelligence.
[00:39:22.164 --> 00:39:25.785]  So the European Empire goes down.
[00:39:25.785 --> 00:39:27.606]  The Russian Empire goes down.
[00:39:27.606 --> 00:39:28.967]  Who's left?
[00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:31.048]  An exhausted British Empire,
[00:39:32.435 --> 00:39:35.437]  Deeply in debt and a war-weary population.
[00:39:35.437 --> 00:39:40.201]  Far more British died, Scots and Irish, in World War I than died in World War II.
[00:39:40.201 --> 00:39:40.921]  Look the numbers up.
[00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:42.162]  It was staggering.
[00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:45.085]  Some battles, 200,000 were lost.
[00:39:45.085 --> 00:39:47.426]  The death toll was in the millions.
[00:39:47.426 --> 00:39:50.008]  Just on the UK side alone.
[00:39:50.008 --> 00:39:51.970]  So, I said I'd make it simple.
[00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:55.052]  This is a very simple breakdown.
[00:39:55.052 --> 00:40:00.877]  You can spend PhD upon PhD to study all the fine intricacies of this.
[00:40:00.877 --> 00:40:01.277]  Skip the break.
[00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:24.140]  So, end of World War I, British Empire tries to re-establish itself through the League of Nations to make other countries feel like they were a party to it, but to use the League of Nations as a payoff arm for geopolitical control.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.421]  The League fails.
[00:40:26.421 --> 00:40:29.483]  The United States, weary of war, pulls back from it.
[00:40:29.483 --> 00:40:30.824]  Woodrow Wilson's plan fails.
[00:40:35.091 --> 00:40:42.457]  Then, Germany under the Versailles Treaty and what's left of the Austro-Hungarian Empire becomes angry.
[00:40:42.457 --> 00:40:47.821]  Germany has a lot of its lands taken, other parts of the empire have been taken.
[00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:54.706]  And so, you see the rise of Hitler to respond to that.
[00:40:54.706 --> 00:41:01.011]  With the end of World War II and the defeat of the Nazis, now what's left of the European Empire is officially defeated.
[00:41:02.213 --> 00:41:09.978]  It merges officially into the British Empire at the Bilderberg Conference in Oosterbeek, Holland.
[00:41:09.978 --> 00:41:18.723]  This has come out in the Senate files, which I was given by a Senate archivist that visited me at the site of Bilderberg when I was covering it 14 years ago.
[00:41:18.723 --> 00:41:22.685]  We published those secret documents and no one seemed to care.
[00:41:22.685 --> 00:41:25.867]  Out of the secret Senate archives.
[00:41:25.867 --> 00:41:27.448]  So we're now at the end of World War II.
[00:41:27.448 --> 00:41:28.549]  We have the Bretton Woods Agreement.
[00:41:29.929 --> 00:41:35.753]  To make the dollar the world reserve currency of the planet.
[00:41:35.753 --> 00:41:36.814]  So who's left?
[00:41:36.814 --> 00:41:40.456]  You have the Soviet Union set up as a false opposition group.
[00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:43.078]  They didn't totally control it, but they put it in charge.
[00:41:43.078 --> 00:41:49.122]  The globalists here in the West gave nuclear technology, atomic technology to the Russians.
[00:41:49.122 --> 00:41:56.007]  So you have the Soviet Union, and you have the British Empire, and the US Empire, and by the end of World War II,
[00:41:57.312 --> 00:42:06.416]  Through the Council on Foreign Relations and the Atlantic Movement, the British Empire had officially been merged into the U.S.
[00:42:06.416 --> 00:42:09.437]  Empire.
[00:42:09.437 --> 00:42:15.980]  Europe was now a controlled vassal state split up by the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.301]  That's what the globalists call the British-U.S.
[00:42:18.301 --> 00:42:19.802]  combined empire alliance.
[00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:31.764]  They then play out this kabuki dance while the Russians use their opposition to the West and we use our opposition to them to battle and consolidate control by starting proxy wars in different nations.
[00:42:31.764 --> 00:42:46.589]  That was the pretext for the two systems in the bipolar political world to actually expand control of the entire planet while the very same Rothschild Rockefeller combines were funding both the Soviet
[00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.352]  and the Anglo-American Empire.
[00:42:50.352 --> 00:43:02.559]  But you had to have that Hegelian dialectic of two sides, like a two-party system, to get people to buy into the fact that this was a supposed real battle.
[00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:08.243]  And real troops were dying, and real bombs were dropping, and real bullets were flying.
[00:43:08.243 --> 00:43:14.687]  But at the end of the day, at the highest levels since the Yalta Conference at the end of World War II,
[00:43:16.038 --> 00:43:18.180]  And then Bretton Woods, this had all been decided.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:43.359]  And there were sub-developments down the way that were large, like going in with British Intelligence and Lawrence of Arabia, and then making deals at the end of World War II, off the agreements he'd made with the British Empire, that the Arabs would denominate the oil worldwide in dollars to make the dollar the new coin of the realm, the new planetary currency, replacing the British sterling pound.
[00:43:45.899 --> 00:43:53.283]  Because I'll get to the new stuff here, but it's important to get a basic breakdown of what happened previously.
[00:43:53.283 --> 00:43:54.484]  So now that that had happened...
[00:43:57.469 --> 00:44:04.736]  We then see things from the 1950s through playing out with the supposed confrontation of the West with communism.
[00:44:04.736 --> 00:44:12.944]  But the West having to surveil and having to spy and having to have huge defense budgets to counter the Soviet menace.
[00:44:12.944 --> 00:44:15.907]  And then you have the Korean War and the armistice and the...
[00:44:18.402 --> 00:44:20.063]  Cease fire!
[00:44:20.063 --> 00:44:46.077]  And you've got 1949, Chiang Kai-shek in China, the Nationalists double-cross, and the CIA, later declassifying in the 90s, what the John Birch Society said in the 60s was true, that the CIA and British intelligence helped defeat the Nationalists and put Mao Zedong into power, and China would be the new model in the future
[00:44:47.096 --> 00:44:47.496]  We're good to go.
[00:45:07.546 --> 00:45:21.089]  49 until about 1971 to be able to kill off 60 plus million of his people and consolidate control over the regional governments and so that China could now be set up to take over.
[00:45:21.089 --> 00:45:34.431]  That's when George Herbert Walker Bush, who supposedly never been in the CIA, only ran the Kennedy assassination at a young age, was then sent to be the ambassador, the first ambassador with an open China, to China and
[00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:45.768]  Nixon then set up the Open China Policy and then China went from 90% no running water electricity to the superpower house it is today.
[00:45:45.768 --> 00:45:54.133]  Then accelerating through with the wars and the debilitation and the domestic annihilation of the U.S.
[00:45:54.133 --> 00:46:02.719]  and the breakup of the family and the de-industrialization projects transferring our jobs to China, India, Mexico and 160 plus other third world countries.
[00:46:02.719 --> 00:46:03.900]  We skip all of that
[00:46:04.622 --> 00:46:11.565]  More recent history in the last 30 years, and lead us to where we are today.
[00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:29.995]  So while all of this was going on, and all of this was happening, State Street, BlackRock, got control of 88% of public companies, where their largest shareholder is one of these entities, and
[00:46:31.072 --> 00:46:51.771]  They gave unlimited funding out of the private central banks to State Street to BlackRock to Vanguard to have more than 15 trillion dollars in liquidity to demand to any board or any corporation or any company that was publicly traded that they can either buy them with a hostile outside corporate takeover or sick feds on them if they wouldn't sell but in most cases
[00:46:52.799 --> 00:46:56.825]  They just wanted to be paid off, they'd run up the white flags of the pirates and let them get full control.
[00:46:56.825 --> 00:47:07.260]  And that's why it doesn't matter if they're Kamikaze Anheuser-Busch, or they're Kamikaze Skittles, or they're Kamikaze North Face, or they're Kamikaze Target, or they're Kamikaze Disney, or they're Kamikaze...
[00:47:08.712 --> 00:47:14.476]  All these companies to push their anti-human, anti-family agenda because the globalists have gotten control of our country.
[00:47:14.476 --> 00:47:17.657]  The only thing left standing in their way is a nuclear family.
[00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:19.619]  They've got education by and large.
[00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:20.879]  They've got the banks.
[00:47:20.879 --> 00:47:22.761]  They've got the medical system.
[00:47:22.761 --> 00:47:24.361]  They've got most of the state governments.
[00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:25.622]  They've got the federal government.
[00:47:25.622 --> 00:47:27.223]  They've got the other central governments.
[00:47:27.223 --> 00:47:28.364]  They've got control of the media.
[00:47:28.784 --> 00:47:36.006]  Only thing standing in their way is our biology of men and women and children and wanting prosperity and organizing and standing together.
[00:47:36.006 --> 00:47:47.449]  They've got control through the ecclesiastical movement and the World Council of Churches of most of the organized religion.
[00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:52.930]  Now the wild card of the Muslims enters into this, but I'll cover that later.
[00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.431]  So by giving you a brief 15-minute history,
[00:47:57.964 --> 00:48:02.967]  Which was an oversimplification.
[00:48:02.967 --> 00:48:08.391]  That now leads us to where we are today.
[00:48:08.391 --> 00:48:18.738]  With 88% of the companies traded on the NASDAQ or Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Fortune 5000, not the Fortune 500, 88% controlled by three companies.
[00:48:18.738 --> 00:48:20.359]  One of them controls 70% of that.
[00:48:27.725 --> 00:48:29.386]  BlackRock.
[00:48:29.386 --> 00:48:34.509]  And both, all three organizations are incestuous and basically the same thing.
[00:48:34.509 --> 00:48:41.253]  And they go on TV, they go up the table and say, we're going to control your behavior, we're going to run your life, we're going to have a social credit score, we're going to have an ESG.
[00:48:41.253 --> 00:48:41.974]  You saw all that.
[00:48:41.974 --> 00:48:47.637]  And they're moving forward with it.
[00:48:47.637 --> 00:48:50.239]  So we want to know the mechanism.
[00:48:50.239 --> 00:48:53.341]  It is the central banks, it is the unlimited currency.
[00:48:53.341 --> 00:48:56.483]  They give their investment firms to then buy everything up.
[00:48:57.469 --> 00:49:17.476]  And then if they can't make you sell, I can't tell you how many people in Maui or Kauai, some of the locals I went and met with and had dinner with, some of the chiefs and some of the deputy chiefs and the people, I mean folks that had 50 acres in Kauai right on the water, they're being offered $500 million by billionaires for it, won't sell it.
[00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:21.478]  Some have a little restaurant, they're being offered $50 million for it, it's only an acre, won't sell it.
[00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:37.454]  And then in comes a hurricane with 60, 70 mile an hour winds and all the scrub brush and all you gotta do is light a fire right before the town begins and the way the wind's blowing and it all burns down.
[00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:50.237]  But instead of investigating the arsonist, instead of investigating what was going on, because all the surveillance cameras have been removed, destroyed, you blame space lasers.
[00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:51.717]  So it's a dead end and goes nowhere.
[00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:02.606]  Don't need a billion-dollar laser.
[00:50:02.606 --> 00:50:07.050]  All you need's a one-dollar lighter and some gasoline.
[00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:08.311]  And they've been caught and done everywhere.
[00:50:08.311 --> 00:50:15.038]  And that's just one microcosm of the documents came out where Antifa, funded by BlackRock, it's all come out in the big banks.
[00:50:16.479 --> 00:50:18.500]  Disney, you name it, funds Black Lives Matter.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.800]  They would have anti-foul.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:27.842]  We got documents from Alexander Soros when they came out like six years ago where he was in command directing them on what buildings to attack and where to go and what to burn.
[00:50:27.842 --> 00:50:33.184]  And it's all small businesses and groups and organizations that they don't own and control.
[00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:42.116]  And so that's why all the big hotels and other organizations, they didn't burn because the firefighters were there.
[00:50:42.116 --> 00:50:43.558]  They soaked it all in water.
[00:50:43.558 --> 00:50:45.020]  They knew to water all their bushes.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.982]  They knew to clear the debris.
[00:50:46.982 --> 00:50:48.945]  They knew what was coming.
[00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:51.549]  And that's a microcosm of the larger system.
[00:50:52.927 --> 00:50:53.648]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:50:53.648 --> 00:50:56.613]  I'm going to start playing clips explaining this from different angles.
[00:50:56.613 --> 00:50:58.075]  How they're getting rid of your voting.
[00:50:58.075 --> 00:50:59.717]  How they control you.
[00:50:59.717 --> 00:51:01.220]  How they're taking over.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.688]  Let's start with Patrick McDavid on Joe Rogan, that these numbers are dead on, on BlackRock and how they run the world.
[00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:07.029]  Here it is.
[00:51:09.147 --> 00:51:18.413]  88% of the companies on S&P 500, the largest shareholder is either State Street, BlackRock, or Vanguard.
[00:51:18.413 --> 00:51:18.833]  88% of them.
[00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:20.174]  Well, how big is BlackRock?
[00:51:20.174 --> 00:51:22.396]  $10 trillion.
[00:51:22.396 --> 00:51:24.037]  How big is $10 trillion?
[00:51:24.037 --> 00:51:28.080]  Only two countries have a bigger GDP than what BlackRock has.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.320]  U.S.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.041]  and China.
[00:51:29.041 --> 00:51:30.482]  That's how big BlackRock is.
[00:51:30.482 --> 00:51:33.264]  And then you see their influence in defense contracts.
[00:51:33.264 --> 00:51:36.646]  If you Google top shareholders of Raytheon, BlackRock, Vanguard,
[00:51:36.826 --> 00:51:38.448]  Okay, let's go look at Hollywood.
[00:51:38.448 --> 00:51:39.829]  Same thing you see there.
[00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:41.311]  Let's go look at pharmaceutical.
[00:51:41.311 --> 00:51:42.832]  And you're like, wait a minute.
[00:51:42.832 --> 00:51:45.235]  These guys essentially have a monopoly.
[00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.517]  A billionaire to these guys is nothing.
[00:51:47.517 --> 00:51:54.725]  They got the kind of control that make companies fire boards, they can replace CEOs, they can replace leaders if they don't like.
[00:51:54.725 --> 00:51:56.687]  But they say 50% is a monopoly law.
[00:51:56.687 --> 00:51:58.189]  That is already a monopoly.
[00:51:59.008 --> 00:52:00.069]  But what else is in their way?
[00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:04.070]  The nuclear family and local elections and national elections.
[00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.291]  So you got to get rid of that.
[00:52:05.291 --> 00:52:13.575]  Google's already gaming the elections, blocking access to voter information, which Professor Epstein says is a 30% swing on average to steal elections.
[00:52:13.575 --> 00:52:16.856]  Blocking the Hunter laptop, things like that.
[00:52:16.856 --> 00:52:22.179]  But here is a conversation with Sergey Brin, the founder of Google, W.F.
[00:52:22.179 --> 00:52:24.700]  Klaus Schwab, saying, soon we won't have elections.
[00:52:25.891 --> 00:52:33.177]  So technology now is and digital technologies mainly have an analytical power.
[00:52:33.177 --> 00:52:41.884]  Now we go into a predictive power and we have seen the first examples and your company very much involved into it.
[00:52:41.884 --> 00:52:45.347]  But since the next step could be to go into a prescriptive.
[00:52:46.207 --> 00:52:47.829]  Yeah, why do we need elections?
[00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:48.229]  So...
[00:53:09.502 --> 00:53:11.824]  What's shareholder capitalism they keep talking about?
[00:53:11.824 --> 00:53:19.953]  I remember a Bloomberg headline ten years ago where, soon Prime Ministers and Presidents won't exist, we will appoint technocrats, says Debo Screw.
[00:53:19.953 --> 00:53:22.175]  That's called dictatorship.
[00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:24.517]  Not Alex Jones telling you, it's right there.
[00:53:24.517 --> 00:53:28.842]  They're ruling you out in the open.
[00:53:28.842 --> 00:53:32.806]  And now they give you a social credit score where if you don't behave like they want or castrate your child or
[00:53:35.148 --> 00:53:37.869]  Live in some 200-square-foot coffin apartment.
[00:53:37.869 --> 00:53:38.990]  They cut off your job.
[00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.971]  They cut off your bank account.
[00:53:39.971 --> 00:53:40.911]  It's not coming.
[00:53:40.911 --> 00:53:41.671]  It's already here.
[00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:42.692]  The debanking's everywhere.
[00:53:42.692 --> 00:53:44.833]  Where's Congress?
[00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:48.295]  Here's Schwab on shareholder capitalism.
[00:53:49.485 --> 00:53:55.510]  Who will really command the 4th Industrial Revolution and its technology like Artificial Intelligence?
[00:53:55.510 --> 00:54:02.716]  What's your sense of who's best placed at this time to lead the world into the 4th Industrial Revolution?
[00:54:02.716 --> 00:54:05.058]  Because you pretty much created this term.
[00:54:05.058 --> 00:54:11.544]  We're seeing the kind of technological strides that China has made with the 5G technology.
[00:54:11.544 --> 00:54:15.127]  Do you believe that this could potentially be China's time once again?
[00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:22.553]  We should make here again a, let's say, a differentiation.
[00:54:22.553 --> 00:54:27.555]  On the one hand, we have state capitalism.
[00:54:27.555 --> 00:54:31.317]  On the other hand, we have shareholder or private capitalism.
[00:54:31.317 --> 00:54:33.638]  So it's a clash between two systems.
[00:54:35.279 --> 00:54:52.867]  I believe that state capitalism in the short term provides certain advantages because you can mobilize in a concentrated way a lot of resources to reach a specific objective.
[00:54:53.487 --> 00:54:59.329]  But I believe that the future is not state capitalism or shareholder capitalism.
[00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:11.673]  The future is what I call stakeholder capitalism, which is combined with the social responsibility.
[00:55:11.673 --> 00:55:19.135]  Which Obama, before he left office, told colleges in Latin America is a merger of capitalism and communism.
[00:55:19.135 --> 00:55:20.016]  So the definition
[00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:21.822]  As of today,
[00:55:46.235 --> 00:55:57.638]  A bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order.
[00:55:57.638 --> 00:55:58.859]  Without a court approval.
[00:55:58.859 --> 00:56:00.779]  I don't know why the clip got cut short.
[00:56:00.779 --> 00:56:02.880]  We'll add that in post when it's uploaded to Bandai Video.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.781]  Let's go out with a clip of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:56:04.781 --> 00:56:05.781]  two days ago talking about this.
[00:56:05.781 --> 00:56:12.983]  I'm seeing Americans live at a level of desperation, of depression.
[00:56:14.008 --> 00:56:19.931]  That I never thought I'd see in this country, that I associated with Latin America when I was a boy.
[00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:27.034]  The average income now in America is 5,000 times less, the average income.
[00:56:27.034 --> 00:56:30.676]  $5,000 less than the cost of basic human needs.
[00:56:30.676 --> 00:56:40.901]  And that's why over the past, and 35% of the people in this country are no longer making enough money to pay for those needs.
[00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:42.721]  In order to bridge that gap, that $5,000 gap,
[00:56:44.758 --> 00:56:48.119]  People are putting their debt on their credit card.
[00:56:48.119 --> 00:56:58.462]  And the credit card rates, the credit card debt, personal debt, this week, for the first time in history, exceeded $1 trillion.
[00:56:58.462 --> 00:57:04.503]  And people are paying on average a 22% interest on that debt.
[00:57:04.503 --> 00:57:07.944]  If the mafia did that to you, it'd be called loan sharking.
[00:57:07.944 --> 00:57:10.385]  But if the banks do it, it's business as usual.
[00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:11.165]  And those banks
[00:57:11.954 --> 00:57:17.378]  Our own primarily by three companies, Black Rock, State Street, and Vanguard.
[00:57:17.378 --> 00:57:25.344]  So they are now, and over the past year, we've lost 700,000 homeowners in this country.
[00:57:25.344 --> 00:57:27.906]  Those homes were bought up by those companies.
[00:57:29.043 --> 00:57:33.965]  And that's more homes than we lost in 2008 during the great mortgage crisis.
[00:57:33.965 --> 00:57:38.066]  And if they can't get your house, they'll just have arsonists burn it down.
[00:57:38.066 --> 00:57:38.806]  Figured it out?
[00:57:38.806 --> 00:57:43.308]  Look, this is absolute war by the Rothschild megamags against you and your family.
[00:57:43.308 --> 00:57:45.468]  But if we identify and understand it, we can beat them.
[00:57:45.468 --> 00:57:46.509]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[00:57:46.509 --> 00:57:49.369]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:57:49.369 --> 00:57:54.211]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.
[00:57:55.049 --> 00:57:55.209]  I don't
[00:58:17.557 --> 00:58:19.339]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[00:58:19.339 --> 00:58:22.022]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[00:58:22.022 --> 00:58:25.686]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[00:58:25.686 --> 00:58:31.272]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[00:58:31.272 --> 00:58:34.095]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[00:58:34.095 --> 00:58:35.196]  And here's what's even crazier.
[00:58:35.717 --> 00:58:44.819]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:59:04.582 --> 00:59:06.283]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:59:06.283 --> 00:59:09.244]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:59:09.244 --> 00:59:10.885]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:59:10.885 --> 00:59:15.807]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:59:15.807 --> 00:59:17.528]  This is something you need now.
[00:59:17.528 --> 00:59:22.110]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:27.832]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[00:59:27.832 --> 00:59:33.995]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[00:59:34.375 --> 00:59:35.735]  And air filtration.

[00:59:38.416 --> 00:59:39.697]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[00:59:39.697 --> 00:59:42.578]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:52.881]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:56.802]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:03.428 --> 01:00:10.690]  All right, I'm going to get more into the globalists, how they control the world, what their future plans are, how we stop them next segment.
[01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:18.633]  But because we're seeing all these fires set, the left's being caught everywhere doing it, the media is trying to cover it up, it hits the local news.
[01:00:18.633 --> 01:00:23.054]  I want to play a Greg Reeves report dealing with this.
[01:00:23.054 --> 01:00:29.857]  What's causing the California wildfires in the lead up to the stolen election in 2000?
[01:00:31.459 --> 01:00:38.345]  And we're going to come back and lay all of this out, open the phones up, get into a bunch of other news items, but I cannot impress upon you enough.
[01:00:38.345 --> 01:00:39.706]  All I do is study this.
[01:00:39.706 --> 01:00:40.767]  We know their battle plan.
[01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:42.368]  We know how to stop them.
[01:00:42.368 --> 01:00:44.550]  But people have to understand, this is tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:45.911]  This is real.
[01:00:45.911 --> 01:00:46.712]  This is happening.
[01:00:46.712 --> 01:00:48.133]  This isn't a game.
[01:00:48.133 --> 01:00:53.337]  And you can pretend like you're part of the power structure and go along with it, you're going to be destroyed.
[01:00:53.337 --> 01:00:57.140]  I know most of you get that, but the new viewers and listeners need to understand this is not a game.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:57.681]  Here's the report.
[01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:10.166]  Satellite video shows what looks to be two explosions occurring, precisely where the two Riverside fires broke out that same night.
[01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:13.948]  Were these explosions caused by PG&E?
[01:01:13.948 --> 01:01:17.590]  Why isn't this a bigger story?
[01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.671]  From October 8th through Halloween 2017, the Tubbs Fire raged.
[01:01:20.671 --> 01:01:24.673]  Over 5,000 structures were leveled to ash.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:39.847]  Pacific Gas and Electric, PG&E, was found responsible for 16 of the Tubbs fires, at a cost of over $10 billion.
[01:01:39.847 --> 01:01:52.035]  PG&E's response was to claim that the fires will continue, and rather than address the problem, they gave a dire warning that any future damages they are found responsible for will bankrupt them.
[01:01:53.638 --> 01:02:06.867]  And just weeks later on August 31st, California State Legislature passed a utility bailout bill which would simply pass the buck to the taxpayer and let PG&E off the hook for any future damages.
[01:02:08.533 --> 01:02:17.216]  Two months later, on November 8th, the Camp Fire Wildfire broke out, destroying Kunkow and Paradise, California.
[01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:24.738]  Over 18,000 structures were destroyed, and at least 85 people lost their lives.
[01:02:24.738 --> 01:02:33.801]  After an investigation, it was found that once again, electrical transmission lines owned and operated by PG&E caused the Camp Fire Wildfire.
[01:02:35.148 --> 01:02:39.210]  The deadliest wildfire in California history.
[01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:45.434]  But thanks to state legislature, California taxpayers will cover the cost.
[01:02:45.434 --> 01:02:56.700]  On October 9th of this year, PG&E cuts off power to half a million homes as a precaution against sparking wildfires in Northern California.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:02.143]  A day later, on October 10th, the Saddle Ridge Fire breaks out in Southern California.
[01:03:04.474 --> 01:03:14.902]  That night, satellite video shows what looks to be two explosions occurring precisely where the two Riverside fires broke out that same night.
[01:03:14.902 --> 01:03:17.264]  But nobody's talking about that.
[01:03:17.264 --> 01:03:23.548]  The news is blaming the Sandalwood fire on burning garbage.
[01:03:23.548 --> 01:03:27.992]  Were these explosions caused by PG&E?
[01:03:27.992 --> 01:03:29.513]  Why isn't this a bigger story?
[01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:40.056]  My video that reported on the anomalies of the Campfire Wildfire was deleted by YouTube for being inappropriate content.
[01:03:40.056 --> 01:03:43.598]  It can still be found at band.video.
[01:03:43.598 --> 01:03:47.139]  But what is inappropriate about asking questions?
[01:03:47.139 --> 01:03:49.941]  Who is YouTube working for?
[01:03:49.941 --> 01:03:56.925]  There are many practical questions to be asked about PG&E, but there is also a very strange nature to these fires.
[01:03:58.413 --> 01:04:02.535]  They seem to destroy houses and spare the trees.
[01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:05.017]  They jump from house to house.
[01:04:05.017 --> 01:04:07.758]  And they jump to the freeway.
[01:04:07.758 --> 01:04:13.861]  They melt aluminum alloy and burn houses to powdery ash.
[01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:18.924]  The Rothschild Investment Group collects billions of dollars from PG&E.
[01:04:18.924 --> 01:04:26.008]  In an age of outcry against corrupt billionaires, why are the Rothschilds and PG&E being left off the hook?
[01:04:27.472 --> 01:04:31.755]  For California, be safe, and Godspeed.
[01:04:31.755 --> 01:04:38.279]  This is Greg Reese, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:45.464]  All right, we've exposed to the global star how they've got control of the world, the power structure it's made up of.
[01:04:45.464 --> 01:04:49.106]  Now we'll talk about how to stop them.
[01:04:49.106 --> 01:04:50.907]  On the other side, InfoWars.
[01:04:50.907 --> 01:04:53.249]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:04:53.249 --> 01:04:55.951]  Stakeholder capitalism is communism in disguise, remember that.

[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:08.242]  Vassals towered over vast landscapes and knights championed honor and valor, there came an unforeseen darkness.
[01:06:08.242 --> 01:06:15.464]  Amidst this impending doom stood a knight called Alex Jones, a brave and outspoken herald known as the Truth Sayer.
[01:06:15.464 --> 01:06:17.564]  Sir Alex Jones was not alone.
[01:06:17.564 --> 01:06:20.425]  In his most desperate hour in the battle against evil,
[01:06:20.985 --> 01:06:23.567]  A radiant light descended from the heavens.
[01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:28.331]  God, in all his glory and his legion of angels, stood by Alex's side.
[01:06:28.331 --> 01:06:33.435]  The battle raged on, but with every blow, Alex Jones' conviction grew stronger.
[01:06:33.435 --> 01:06:37.658]  With every truth he proclaimed, the demonic forces faltered.
[01:06:37.658 --> 01:06:44.964]  When the enemy was vanquished, Alex Jones swore a solemn oath that should the realm need him again, he would return.
[01:06:45.734 --> 01:06:52.200]  And now it's Alex Jones, leading a full frontal assault on the satanic New World Order.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.665]  Tune in at infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.181]  I want to be clear in how I characterize this.
[01:07:02.181 --> 01:07:05.222]  This is mostly a protest.
[01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:08.663]  It is not, generally speaking, unruly.
[01:07:08.663 --> 01:07:10.523]  The building is collapsing!
[01:07:10.523 --> 01:07:12.624]  The building just exploded!
[01:07:12.624 --> 01:07:13.504]  Oh my God!
[01:07:13.504 --> 01:07:21.406]  The city's third precinct police station on fire.
[01:07:21.406 --> 01:07:26.568]  All over the world, the left is burning down working class neighborhoods where the elites want to move in and build their skyscrapers.
[01:07:27.885 --> 01:07:30.326]  They're shipping in fentanyl.
[01:07:30.326 --> 01:07:34.949]  They're denying our veterans aid.
[01:07:34.949 --> 01:07:37.410]  They're behind the fires in Maui.
[01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:39.051]  Arsonists with lighters and gasoline.
[01:07:39.051 --> 01:07:41.113]  When a hurricane hit with high winds.
[01:07:41.113 --> 01:07:47.736]  Anytime high winds come in, the left's gonna be there setting fires.
[01:07:56.881 --> 01:07:58.462]  Yeah, you say try it in a small town.
[01:07:58.462 --> 01:08:01.744]  The left's not coming with UN helmets and troops.
[01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:05.367]  They're gonna burn your ass down.
[01:08:05.367 --> 01:08:06.547]  Let's be honest.
[01:08:06.547 --> 01:08:07.708]  They do come to small towns.
[01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.689]  They burn us out.
[01:08:09.689 --> 01:08:14.813]  That's how we always knew the bad guys would take over out west during the Range Wars.
[01:08:14.813 --> 01:08:16.293]  They burn you out.
[01:08:16.293 --> 01:08:20.176]  That's what they're doing.
[01:08:20.176 --> 01:08:21.477]  Yeah, try that in a small town.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:27.322]  And when the communists are in control of the media and the police, they get away with it.
[01:08:27.322 --> 01:08:36.167]  Well, they try it in a small town.
[01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:38.288]  They're not coming with guns.
[01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:39.529]  They're coming to burn your house down.
[01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:53.494]  Yeah, if you cross the line with a gun or an army tank, we'll stand up to you.
[01:08:53.494 --> 01:08:56.956]  Not when they pour the gasoline on the trees and brush and burn you down.
[01:08:56.956 --> 01:09:03.478]  But the feds were planning to do it at Ruby Ridge, so they got stopped, burned him out.
[01:09:03.478 --> 01:09:10.060]  They burned him out at Waco.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.021]  Yeah, the Delta Force went in.
[01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:14.742]  Got ordered by Bill Clinton to kill the Davidians on Day 51.
[01:09:16.192 --> 01:09:18.233]  They tried it in small town, they won.
[01:09:18.233 --> 01:09:19.094]  They burned them down.
[01:09:19.094 --> 01:09:24.757]  They're not gonna fight us with guns, folks, not in the first round.
[01:09:24.757 --> 01:09:27.358]  They're gonna cut off the food, cut off the energy.
[01:09:27.358 --> 01:09:30.780]  They're gonna burn your house down.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:35.162]  Yeah, cross that line, it won't be long, huh?
[01:09:35.162 --> 01:09:36.523]  They're gonna burn your house down?
[01:09:38.473 --> 01:09:40.493]  They don't come at you with weapons you think.
[01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:45.114]  They come at you with pedophilia, and fentanyl, and open borders, and poisoned food.
[01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.874]  Farmers are dropping their own crops for the day.
[01:09:46.874 --> 01:09:49.735]  A friend is in need and they've come to help.
[01:09:49.735 --> 01:09:53.456]  It's what this community and a lot of our community stand for.
[01:09:53.456 --> 01:10:00.417]  Somebody needs some help, you'll get it.
[01:10:00.417 --> 01:10:06.838]  If you live in valuable real estate and you're working class, and high winds are coming, Antifa's gonna be in those woods setting fires.
[01:10:07.955 --> 01:10:10.956]  You know who commands Antifa.
[01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:14.157]  You know who runs it.
[01:10:14.157 --> 01:10:15.037]  We're under attack.
[01:10:15.037 --> 01:10:16.577]  They're cutting everything off.
[01:10:16.577 --> 01:10:19.318]  Monday Much Watch live broadcast.
[01:10:19.318 --> 01:10:25.540]  Alex Jones, that's me, will expose who runs and controls the NWO and how to stop them.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.060]  Share this link.
[01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:33.715]  Well, I just did 30 plus minutes laying out the basic history of the current geopolitical systems.
[01:10:33.715 --> 01:10:37.537]  All that's left is the communist Chinese, the Russians hanging on by their fingernails.
[01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:38.638]  They kicked out the globalists.
[01:10:38.638 --> 01:10:40.018]  They're not perfect.
[01:10:40.018 --> 01:10:44.921]  So there's the globalist EU, New World Order, British Empire, American Combine.
[01:10:44.921 --> 01:10:50.845]  There's the CHICOM project to leverage out and de-industrialize the West.
[01:10:50.845 --> 01:10:52.806]  It's breaking with the globalists and going on its own.
[01:10:54.693 --> 01:10:54.773]  It's
[01:11:13.052 --> 01:11:15.253]  So they created the federalist system.
[01:11:15.253 --> 01:11:17.733]  It's not federal, it's the opposite of federalism.
[01:11:17.733 --> 01:11:22.754]  That you would think, people think federalism means the feds run things, that's what they teach in schools.
[01:11:22.754 --> 01:11:26.855]  Federalism means there's three branches of the federal government that separate powers and keep them balanced.
[01:11:26.855 --> 01:11:31.296]  And three branches in local government as well.
[01:11:31.296 --> 01:11:35.017]  And then at the state level, three branches of that broken up.
[01:11:35.017 --> 01:11:37.758]  So six levels.
[01:11:37.758 --> 01:11:41.659]  Legislative, executive, judiciary, federal.
[01:11:41.659 --> 01:11:42.399]  At the state level,
[01:11:44.361 --> 01:11:46.982]  State, county, city.
[01:11:46.982 --> 01:11:54.226]  And within all three of those systems, three different systems.
[01:11:54.226 --> 01:11:56.647]  See how it works?
[01:11:56.647 --> 01:11:59.448]  It's firewalls, or like bulkheads in a ship.
[01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:01.589]  If one compartment floods, the rest don't.
[01:12:01.589 --> 01:12:05.011]  What Elon Musk said a few months ago at the World Government Summit in
[01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:11.442]  Dubai, Middle East, WEF, he said, we don't want one centralized thing.
[01:12:11.442 --> 01:12:16.364]  It creates centralization and one tyranny can take over and we then can't contain the contagion.
[01:12:16.364 --> 01:12:19.866]  He's talking about the firewalls.
[01:12:19.866 --> 01:12:22.047]  So that's where we are.
[01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:26.049]  Good article in the Washington Times, stakeholder capitalism is communism in disguise.
[01:12:26.049 --> 01:12:30.291]  And that's what Klaus Schwab said in that clip I played last hour.
[01:12:30.291 --> 01:12:32.632]  He goes, we have state capitalism, fascism,
[01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:48.731]  And then we have the corporate interests that are loving and liberal, that's the communism, but it's the richest people in the world who exempt themselves from taxes, it's all oxymoronic, merging into this system that is the communist Chinese model.
[01:12:48.731 --> 01:13:03.179]  That's why communist China runs all these TV ads and programs and controls four of the six big Hollywood production houses and TikTok and all their messages are men should fight with women, women should fight with men, pedophilia is good for children, and all of it
[01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:16.410]  All of it, ladies and gentlemen, is banned in China.
[01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:21.114]  Pretty big deal, isn't it?
[01:13:21.114 --> 01:13:26.338]  So let's open the phones up specifically on what I just laid out in the last 40 minutes or so.
[01:13:27.935 --> 01:13:45.470]  And what your view is on what I said, because if you read a Trilateral Commission document, or a CFR document, or a Communist Chinese governmental document, or an EU document, Carol Quigley's book, Bill Clinton's mentor back in the 1960s, Tragedy and Hope, it's everything I told you.
[01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:46.792]  This is not my opinion.
[01:13:46.792 --> 01:13:49.494]  This is the governing system of the earth.
[01:13:49.494 --> 01:13:53.638]  But the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN will call you a racister.
[01:13:55.070 --> 01:14:08.815]  Terrorists, if you talk about it, because they don't want adults discussing what's taking us over the big central banks and their investment firms and their ESGs and their social currency systems.
[01:14:08.815 --> 01:14:11.376]  State Street, BlackRock, Vanguard.
[01:14:11.376 --> 01:14:13.037]  Let's put their logos back up.
[01:14:13.037 --> 01:14:22.460]  You know why Vanguard and State Street and BlackRock all use the symbol of a pirate ship?
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.421]  They just use the symbol of an all-seeing eye pyramid.
[01:14:25.782 --> 01:14:36.871]  They use a symbol of a sailing ship, a British or Spanish galleon, because they're pirates, ladies and gentlemen, because they're outside the nation states.
[01:14:36.871 --> 01:14:38.252]  They don't pay the taxes.
[01:14:38.252 --> 01:14:39.473]  They don't pay the regulations.
[01:14:39.473 --> 01:14:46.939]  They put them on you and administratively set it up to destroy you.
[01:14:46.939 --> 01:14:50.042]  BlackRock still uses the symbol of the pyramid, but not Vanguard.
[01:14:51.064 --> 01:15:03.111]  And State Street, all the same shareholders, all the same families, waging war on you with a monopoly of over 88% of the stock market.
[01:15:03.111 --> 01:15:15.179]  But they got scared and backed off ESG and name only, they're still doing it, when just a few states, Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas,
[01:15:16.394 --> 01:15:27.543]  Opened up criminal investigations of their monopolies, intimidating companies, legislatures, coming in and trying to take over the energy sector, trying to take over and muscle the state governments.
[01:15:27.543 --> 01:15:29.424]  Separation of power.
[01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.726]  It's not the state government battling the feds now.
[01:15:31.726 --> 01:15:32.947]  The feds are captured.
[01:15:32.947 --> 01:15:35.769]  It's the big corporations coming directly in.
[01:15:37.188 --> 01:15:40.890]  And trying to become the government with their social credit score, with their ESG.
[01:15:59.713 --> 01:16:07.857]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:16:07.857 --> 01:16:18.301]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:24.508]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:16:24.508 --> 01:16:30.796]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com

[01:17:49.021 --> 01:17:52.564]  We will never abide.

[01:18:58.755 --> 01:19:05.120]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:11.544]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:19:11.544 --> 01:19:14.907]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:19:14.907 --> 01:19:24.073]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:19:24.073 --> 01:19:24.534]  Look it up.
[01:19:25.154 --> 01:19:26.515]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[01:19:39.419 --> 01:19:40.399]  It is amazing.
[01:19:40.399 --> 01:19:42.040]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.261]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:19:45.261 --> 01:19:46.682]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:50.443]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:19:55.807 --> 01:19:57.108]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:19:57.108 --> 01:20:00.470]  You need this filter.
[01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:06.355]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:29.644]  Alright folks, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this live Monday edition.
[01:21:29.644 --> 01:21:33.007]  I'll get into more of this next segment when I finish up with the globalists and their master plan.
[01:21:33.007 --> 01:21:34.808]  I'll stop them.
[01:21:34.808 --> 01:21:35.529]  But U.S.
[01:21:35.529 --> 01:21:39.212]  state of Georgia appears set to file charges against Donald Trump imminently.
[01:21:39.212 --> 01:21:44.236]  Reuters is reporting why Georgia's case against Trump could be so damaging.
[01:21:44.236 --> 01:21:48.259]  Oh yes, don't question elections, don't investigate elections, that's illegal.
[01:21:48.259 --> 01:21:48.940]  That's all.
[01:21:50.407 --> 01:21:58.214]  Coming up, so you've already heard the head of BlackRock say that, by the way, you guys found that clip during the break.
[01:21:58.214 --> 01:22:03.880]  We've already heard Larry Flink earlier this year say, we don't want people doing what they want.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.944]  We're going to control the behavior of the public.
[01:22:07.944 --> 01:22:11.127]  And you've also heard the WEF come out and say, we played it earlier,
[01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:14.932]  The head of Google, well, yeah, we're just going to get rid of elections altogether.
[01:22:14.932 --> 01:22:17.935]  But don't question that, because it'll put you in jail.
[01:22:17.935 --> 01:22:19.817]  Nobody wants to get rid of elections.
[01:22:19.817 --> 01:22:22.079]  Nobody's living balanced the middle of the night.
[01:22:22.079 --> 01:22:23.320]  Nobody is doing any of this.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.842]  Yeah, let's play this short.
[01:22:25.842 --> 01:22:28.244]  Larry Fink, top of the top of the New World Order.
[01:22:28.244 --> 01:22:31.867]  He's the top manager of the families that have stolen control of this planet.
[01:22:31.867 --> 01:22:32.308]  Here's the clip.
[01:22:33.012 --> 01:22:37.638]  Behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[01:22:37.638 --> 01:22:42.604]  You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock we are forcing behaviors.
[01:22:42.604 --> 01:22:43.224]  Yep!
[01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.068]  Forcing behaviors through the ESGs, the Social Credit Score.
[01:22:48.576 --> 01:22:49.677]  So, what do they want?
[01:22:49.677 --> 01:22:50.658]  Do they just want power?
[01:22:50.658 --> 01:22:51.639]  Do they want to just own everything?
[01:22:51.639 --> 01:22:52.519]  No, they already do that.
[01:22:52.519 --> 01:22:54.301]  They don't want you around.
[01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:55.662]  They want to sterilize you.
[01:22:55.662 --> 01:22:56.843]  They want to slowly poison you.
[01:22:56.843 --> 01:22:57.964]  They want to get rid of you.
[01:22:57.964 --> 01:23:00.446]  They want 500 million people.
[01:23:00.446 --> 01:23:02.487]  And that's only one branch of the globalists.
[01:23:02.487 --> 01:23:08.192]  The other transhumanists say, oh, we're going to merge the machines and become gods and there'll just be a few of us.
[01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:09.453]  They'll always be killing each other.
[01:23:09.453 --> 01:23:10.614]  They want control.
[01:23:10.614 --> 01:23:11.915]  They hate themselves.
[01:23:11.915 --> 01:23:12.856]  They hate each other.
[01:23:13.843 --> 01:23:16.486]  It is beyond a nightmare scenario.
[01:23:16.486 --> 01:23:21.190]  So, we're discussing these people and how to stop them.
[01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:26.495]  Now, a lot of people own property and a lot of people won't sell it no matter how much fiat money BlackRock's got.
[01:23:26.495 --> 01:23:31.019]  High winds come, Antifa comes, Black Lives Matter come.
[01:23:31.019 --> 01:23:33.862]  They burn down your house.
[01:23:33.862 --> 01:23:35.883]  They cut off your energy.
[01:23:35.883 --> 01:23:37.325]  They ship fentanyl into your community.
[01:23:38.476 --> 01:23:48.041]  The public school tells your five-year-old they're really a girl and secretly fast-tracks them to have their testicles cut off, your daughter's uterus and breast removed.
[01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.982]  They're just getting rid of us.
[01:23:49.982 --> 01:24:00.967]  They're arrogant, they're disconnected, they're evil, they're selfish, they're everything you could imagine and more about the worst people the earth has ever seen.
[01:24:00.967 --> 01:24:06.689]  They put up their guidestones and their monuments to how they're going to keep us at 500 million on and on.
[01:24:06.689 --> 01:24:07.350]  I could play you
[01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:17.920]  I saw another clip this weekend of the WEF with, uh, who's the famous fake naturalist, the woman that deals with great apes?
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.881]  Jane Goodall.
[01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:26.103]  I think we have to admit, if we need to go back to the numbers of 500 years ago, 500 million people.
[01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:29.684]  We've got to get rid of people.
[01:24:29.684 --> 01:24:37.346]  And when Kamala Harris says that, they go, oh, well, Kamala Harris didn't really mean that.
[01:24:37.346 --> 01:24:38.466]  Let me just throw something out again.
[01:24:39.585 --> 01:24:40.505]  Get a community.
[01:24:40.505 --> 01:24:42.546]  Get a gardening organization together.
[01:24:42.546 --> 01:24:44.926]  Clear the brush around the edge of your community.
[01:24:44.926 --> 01:24:46.087]  Know when high winds come.
[01:24:46.087 --> 01:24:53.348]  If you're in an enclave of people, they're coming to burn your house down.
[01:24:53.348 --> 01:25:03.851]  And that's how the police have arrested thousands in Canada, thousands in the U.S., thousands in Europe, because they're not completely controlled yet, because they know when high winds come, the arsonists are going to be waiting.
[01:25:03.851 --> 01:25:06.472]  The police go, where would you set a fire?
[01:25:06.472 --> 01:25:07.152]  And they catch them!
[01:25:08.993 --> 01:25:15.376]  And that is a microcosm or a metaphor or an analogy or a snapshot of victory.
[01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:28.301]  If you admit there's these evil people, if you admit when certain conditions are there, they're going to come and use that for full power, if you admit that there are armies of these criminals, you can and you will defeat them.
[01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:33.863]  Or you can just let this army of criminals continue to destroy.
[01:25:33.863 --> 01:25:35.484]  Here's Jane Goodall.
[01:25:35.484 --> 01:25:35.944]  Listen to this.
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.801]  We cannot hide away from human population growth.
[01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:44.142]  Because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[01:25:44.142 --> 01:25:51.924]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.
[01:25:51.924 --> 01:25:53.725]  Oh yes, much better for us.
[01:25:53.725 --> 01:26:01.447]  We've got full control, we own everything, but they still have swimming pools and automobiles and they go out to movies and ballgames and have healthy children.
[01:26:01.447 --> 01:26:02.588]  Inject them with SV40 cancer!
[01:26:04.148 --> 01:26:05.969]  Inject them with SPAC-13!
[01:26:05.969 --> 01:26:07.149]  Get rid of them!
[01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:10.670]  Get rid of them off of our property!
[01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:11.691]  You say, that's crazy!
[01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:13.211]  Well, what did the Nazis do?
[01:26:13.211 --> 01:26:13.931]  What did the Communists do?
[01:26:13.931 --> 01:26:14.912]  Or were they in control?
[01:26:14.912 --> 01:26:19.173]  Killed our third or half the population.
[01:26:19.173 --> 01:26:20.334]  What did the Druids do?
[01:26:20.334 --> 01:26:23.775]  They would routinely make the general public sacrifice their children.
[01:26:23.775 --> 01:26:25.055]  What did the Babylonians do?
[01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:26.716]  What did all these cultures do?
[01:26:32.011 --> 01:26:36.494]  They would make you give your firstborn over to be sacrificed.
[01:26:36.494 --> 01:26:44.558]  This is an organization, a legion of doom of psychopathic killers.
[01:26:44.558 --> 01:26:48.260]  Won't you admit what's happening?
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.621]  Won't you admit to what they're doing?
[01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:57.786]  So I'm going to go to break, come back with the Trump News, go right to your phone calls, right through to the end of the broadcast today.
[01:26:57.786 --> 01:26:59.347]  We're approaching the halfway point in about four minutes.
[01:27:00.489 --> 01:27:03.151]  But I'm not backed by Vanguard or BlackRock.
[01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:07.854]  You know what happened during the years of lockdown?
[01:27:07.854 --> 01:27:21.762]  Every supplement company, top firms, we use four different ones, really five different ones, all of them at one got bought by investment companies that were connected to State Street, BlackRock, or Vanguard, all these subgroups, they're a monopoly.
[01:27:21.762 --> 01:27:26.625]  And they come to us and say, sorry, we don't want your money anymore.
[01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:28.667]  Or sometimes they just hold onto our money for a year.
[01:27:30.104 --> 01:27:33.547]  And we found out other folks were getting their products, they just weren't giving them to us.
[01:27:33.547 --> 01:27:36.629]  It's how do you sabotage every level of society?
[01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:37.629]  Defund the police.
[01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:39.290]  I mean, you see it.
[01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:46.535]  Allow people to rob and rape and murder and loot stores by the hundreds every day and just burn things down and it's mostly peaceful.
[01:27:46.535 --> 01:27:48.056]  You see it in front of you.
[01:27:48.056 --> 01:27:49.698]  The takedown of civilization.
[01:27:49.698 --> 01:27:54.801]  Because when you can't go to the corner little mom-and-pop grocery store, you can't go to the local wherever.
[01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:57.163]  Oh, you can buy still from Amazon your food though.
[01:27:57.163 --> 01:27:58.744]  Nobody's gonna burn it down.
[01:28:00.706 --> 01:28:03.987]  It's going to be protected.
[01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.368]  It's vertical integration, vertical consolidation.
[01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:12.370]  So please remember us and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get storable food, get water filtration, get air filtration.
[01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:22.314]  I've been authorized by the great folks that make water filtration, air filtration, storable food, My Patriot Supply, till Friday to extend the 10% off sale that's so massive because there's not much markup there.
[01:28:22.314 --> 01:28:26.495]  It's already the best price on air filtration, on water filtration, on storable food.
[01:28:26.495 --> 01:28:27.596]  But it will end Friday.
[01:28:28.516 --> 01:28:29.257]  And that's it.
[01:28:29.257 --> 01:28:32.679]  I've been given authorization until Friday because they're about to sell all the water filters.
[01:28:32.679 --> 01:28:34.600]  They won't have more for a while.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.043]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:28:38.043 --> 01:28:41.365]  That's another way they're hitting you through the water supply.
[01:28:41.365 --> 01:28:42.326]  Cleans everything out.
[01:28:42.326 --> 01:28:42.927]  Highest rated.
[01:28:42.927 --> 01:28:44.208]  Lowest price you're going to find.
[01:28:44.208 --> 01:28:45.408]  Stainless steel gravity water filter.
[01:28:45.408 --> 01:28:48.110]  Alexa Pure is the water filter.
[01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:49.531]  Alexa Breeze is the air filter.
[01:28:49.531 --> 01:28:50.052]  Storable food.
[01:28:50.052 --> 01:28:50.492]  It's all there.
[01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:51.413]  Ready to ship.
[01:28:51.413 --> 01:28:52.574]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:52.574 --> 01:28:53.214]  In stock now.
[01:28:53.214 --> 01:28:54.135]  Ready to ship.
[01:28:54.135 --> 01:28:55.156]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:55.156 --> 01:28:55.616]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:59.485 --> 01:29:04.968]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.
[01:29:04.968 --> 01:29:15.595]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum CBD oil, the incredible things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous system particularly.
[01:29:15.595 --> 01:29:17.636]  Everybody knows it's incredible, it works.
[01:29:17.636 --> 01:29:22.739]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the lowest price.
[01:29:22.739 --> 01:29:25.681]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more
[01:29:27.489 --> 01:29:29.251]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:29:29.251 --> 01:29:31.954]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:29:31.954 --> 01:29:35.598]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:29:35.598 --> 01:29:41.204]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:29:41.204 --> 01:29:44.007]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:29:44.007 --> 01:29:45.128]  And here's what's even crazier.
[01:29:45.909 --> 01:29:47.772]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:29:47.772 --> 01:29:51.036]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:29:51.036 --> 01:29:55.401]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:29:55.401 --> 01:29:56.182]  Rebels In.
[01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:58.545]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now!
[01:29:59.904 --> 01:30:08.046]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:30:08.046 --> 01:30:18.470]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:24.693]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:30:24.693 --> 01:30:30.475]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:41.103]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:45.885]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[01:30:45.885 --> 01:30:51.027]  Get your essential Omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[01:30:51.027 --> 01:30:54.069]  Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil.

[01:30:58.933 --> 01:31:04.766]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4 Store and M4's life not in a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:31:05.202 --> 01:31:06.423]  The answer is simple.
[01:31:06.423 --> 01:31:08.904]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[01:31:35.262 --> 01:31:35.722]  We're good to go.
[01:31:58.892 --> 01:32:01.755]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:32:01.755 --> 01:32:05.259]  And so, please, go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.
[01:32:05.259 --> 01:32:06.881]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[01:32:06.881 --> 01:32:08.582]  You have a little profile there.
[01:32:08.582 --> 01:32:10.304]  Cancel anytime.
[01:32:10.304 --> 01:32:14.649]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months.
[01:32:15.623 --> 01:32:19.445]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[01:32:19.445 --> 01:32:22.407]  You just click it and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[01:32:22.407 --> 01:32:23.487]  So please do that as well.
[01:32:23.487 --> 01:32:28.750]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:30.331]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:32:30.331 --> 01:32:32.071]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[01:32:32.071 --> 01:32:35.033]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:32:35.033 --> 01:32:37.034]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:32:37.034 --> 01:32:38.435]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:32:38.435 --> 01:32:40.536]  But in this major recession going into depression,
[01:32:41.096 --> 01:32:43.518]  And with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:32:43.518 --> 01:32:45.901]  I know times are tough, so thank you for your support.
[01:32:45.901 --> 01:32:49.704]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:32:49.704 --> 01:32:53.187]  That you can do for free, and that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:32:53.187 --> 01:32:58.092]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:32:58.092 --> 01:33:00.674]  God bless you.
[01:33:00.674 --> 01:33:06.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.048 --> 01:33:21.194]  From the front lines of the Information Ward, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.194 --> 01:33:26.037]  Now on the day I was born, the nurses all gathered round.
[01:33:26.037 --> 01:33:30.820]  And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:36.423]  The head nurse spoke up, said leave this one alone.
[01:33:36.423 --> 01:33:40.146]  She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone.
[01:33:46.104 --> 01:34:10.562]  B-b-b-b-b-b-bad B-b-b-b-b-b-bad B-b-b-b-b-b-bad Bad to the bone Bad to the bone I broke a thousand hearts Before I met you I'll break a thousand more, baby Before I am through I wanna be yours, pretty baby Yours and yours alone I'm here to tell you, honey
[01:34:15.265 --> 01:34:24.693]  Trump may face a racketeering charge in Georgia as he keeps praise on anti-Muslim conspiracy theorists.
[01:34:24.693 --> 01:34:30.738]  Wow, they're saying his speech in the indictment on January 6th is the reason they indicted him.
[01:34:30.738 --> 01:34:42.908]  Now it turns out, as we know, Trump was there trying to investigate and talking to county officials that had the right to look at the numbers and see if illegals and dead people were voting, which has come out in this corrupt
[01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:51.135]  DA put in by Soros, like all the rest, is set to indict Trump imminently because he's the frontrunner.
[01:34:51.135 --> 01:34:53.056]  Total, complete election meddling.
[01:34:53.056 --> 01:35:04.140]  We already saw Clinton lawyers like Elias run around all over the country and try to keep MTG and Gozer and many others from being able to run again, because they're so popular, because they question the election as well.
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:06.501]  You're not allowed to do that in our so-called
[01:35:07.478 --> 01:35:07.918]  Free country.
[01:35:07.918 --> 01:35:09.879]  They're trying to criminalize that.
[01:35:09.879 --> 01:35:10.800]  But here's some of the articles.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.461]  It's up on CNN articles, up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:14.461 --> 01:35:15.622]  A link to it.
[01:35:15.622 --> 01:35:22.685]  Trump lawyers receive written invitation to inspect Georgia voting machines.
[01:35:22.685 --> 01:35:29.808]  Can you imagine, ladies and gentlemen, inspecting a voting machine?
[01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:31.109]  How horrible that is.
[01:35:32.031 --> 01:35:33.692]  How evil that is.
[01:35:33.692 --> 01:35:39.015]  Number one rule of the State Department, an election isn't free and fair if you can't inspect things.
[01:35:39.015 --> 01:35:43.858]  But they don't want any of that inspected.
[01:35:43.858 --> 01:35:49.842]  We have a permanent ruling class that intends to stay in there forever.
[01:35:49.842 --> 01:35:55.305]  And they are at war with us, and they are literally cutting off our resources to make us desperate so they can control us.
[01:35:55.305 --> 01:35:59.868]  Our entire way of life is being fed into a wood chipper, a meat grinder, a garbage disposal.
[01:36:01.684 --> 01:36:04.406]  The question is, will you put up with it?
[01:36:04.406 --> 01:36:06.307]  We talk about what they're going to do, you see it.
[01:36:06.307 --> 01:36:12.411]  Collapse the borders, flood the third world populations, keep the third world locked down under IMF world bank control.
[01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:17.134]  Politically, turn everybody against each other, allow crime to run rampant, cut off the
[01:36:19.383 --> 01:36:26.846]  Resources of the public cut off the loans while creating inflation and using the unlimited money they have to buy up and consolidate control.
[01:36:26.846 --> 01:36:34.550]  And again, you won't sell that little place you got in Tennessee or Hawaii or Texas or Michigan or New York.
[01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:36.571]  We'll burn your ass down.
[01:36:36.571 --> 01:36:47.155]  And how it works is just goes down to the intelligence agencies through Alexander Soros, through the operatives that run Antifa, the missions they're supposed to carry out.
[01:36:47.155 --> 01:36:48.316]  And they go carry them out.
[01:36:52.304 --> 01:36:54.105]  High winds hit.
[01:36:54.105 --> 01:36:54.906]  Look at a map.
[01:36:54.906 --> 01:36:55.827]  The wind's coming towards you.
[01:36:55.827 --> 01:36:57.668]  There's dry brush out there.
[01:36:57.668 --> 01:36:59.089]  You don't clear it.
[01:36:59.089 --> 01:37:01.551]  You don't sweep it.
[01:37:01.551 --> 01:37:04.374]  The chance you're gonna be on fire.
[01:37:04.374 --> 01:37:13.441]  You're some meat packing or other food processing facility that's the 10% that aren't owned by three companies.
[01:37:13.441 --> 01:37:18.465]  They're gonna burn your ass down at midnight.
[01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:20.226]  They're gonna come for you.
[01:37:20.226 --> 01:37:20.487]  You know,
[01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:26.194]  I never watched Twin Peaks when it came out in the 90s.
[01:37:26.194 --> 01:37:28.296]  Was it the early 90s?
[01:37:28.296 --> 01:37:31.299]  I did have dinner with Lynch once.
[01:37:31.299 --> 01:37:36.424]  He's been on the show a few times.
[01:37:36.424 --> 01:37:39.666]  I'm not a big TV watcher, but everybody said to me,
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:43.541]  You ought to watch Twin Peaks if you've never seen it.
[01:37:43.541 --> 01:37:49.922]  It's all about the Illuminati and secret societies and people burning things down and blowing things up to get control.
[01:37:49.922 --> 01:37:59.064]  And so I'm almost through the first season, and man, I'm watching this, and it's crazy.
[01:37:59.064 --> 01:38:02.885]  Watched an hour of it last night.
[01:38:02.885 --> 01:38:05.766]  And man, oh man, is that how it really works.
[01:38:07.262 --> 01:38:09.964]  Sex operations with children.
[01:38:09.964 --> 01:38:10.744]  Arson.
[01:38:10.744 --> 01:38:12.885]  Government drug dealers.
[01:38:12.885 --> 01:38:16.527]  Psychic operations.
[01:38:16.527 --> 01:38:19.809]  Welcome to the New World Order, boys and girls.
[01:38:19.809 --> 01:38:22.571]  Welcome.
[01:38:22.571 --> 01:38:28.014]  Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
[01:38:28.014 --> 01:38:34.137]  Now that's a dream scene right there from one of the first episodes.
[01:38:34.137 --> 01:38:35.178]  That's the devil right there.
[01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:43.074]  I was about 10 years old out on the back porch painting an easel.
[01:38:43.074 --> 01:38:44.075]  My dad walks out.
[01:38:44.075 --> 01:38:50.019]  I said, for some reason, I said, dad, paint me the devil.
[01:38:50.019 --> 01:38:53.622]  And he painted like a midget drooling.
[01:38:53.622 --> 01:38:55.063]  And he said, that's the devil.
[01:38:55.063 --> 01:38:59.486]  The devil's a loser.
[01:38:59.486 --> 01:39:04.029]  So you're under asymmetrical fifth generational warfare.
[01:39:08.055 --> 01:39:26.349]  And you can be in the FBI, you can be a school teacher, you can be a professor, you can be an auto mechanic, you can be a nurse, you can be a pharmacist, you can be a school teacher, you can be a farmer, a rancher, you can be a retail worker, you can be a factory worker, you can be a highway worker, you can be a truck driver.
[01:39:26.349 --> 01:39:28.650]  I don't care if you're liberal or you're Democrat.
[01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:30.111]  Get the Joe Rogan clip ready.
[01:39:30.111 --> 01:39:30.832]  It's only 30 seconds.
[01:39:39.298 --> 01:39:41.860]  You're under attack.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.721]  It's not about left or right.
[01:39:43.721 --> 01:39:46.063]  It's about survival.
[01:39:46.063 --> 01:39:56.231]  You know, I told you that I, uh, I talk to Joe all the time, pretty much every day, but I went to dinner for about two hours with Joe about a week and a half ago.
[01:39:56.231 --> 01:39:58.412]  Not this Saturday, last Saturday.
[01:39:58.412 --> 01:40:03.956]  And I, and I, and I said on air, man, he's super red pill now.
[01:40:03.956 --> 01:40:05.898]  And I'm not getting into our private discussions, but
[01:40:08.226 --> 01:40:15.289]  Rogan basically looked at me and he said, I know what's going on.
[01:40:15.289 --> 01:40:18.311]  He told me what was going on.
[01:40:18.311 --> 01:40:19.491]  I said, that's what's going on?
[01:40:19.491 --> 01:40:19.951]  He said, yeah.
[01:40:19.951 --> 01:40:28.395]  He said, hold my beer.
[01:40:28.395 --> 01:40:33.758]  Because that's always been the imprint of the vision God gave me.
[01:40:35.167 --> 01:40:40.110]  27 years ago, and I've been on air about 2 years, that I've talked about since then.
[01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:41.971]  Most people have only been tuned in 5, 10 years.
[01:40:41.971 --> 01:40:45.353]  You've heard me tell this story 100 times if you've been tuned in for 10 years.
[01:40:45.353 --> 01:40:51.436]  I've been telling this story for 27 years.
[01:40:51.436 --> 01:40:53.297]  And I got chills all over my body.
[01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:55.298]  I'm in this restaurant by myself at like 9 o'clock at night.
[01:40:55.298 --> 01:40:58.220]  I just did 2 hours live on local TV at a local radio show, just started.
[01:40:59.189 --> 01:41:01.849]  I'm eating a chicken fried steak, drinking a glass iced tea.
[01:41:01.849 --> 01:41:03.090]  They got a guy mopping up.
[01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:04.410]  It's like a Tuesday, Wednesday night.
[01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:05.390]  Nobody's in there.
[01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:08.371]  I first got in and there were 10 tables full, but I got in late.
[01:41:08.371 --> 01:41:10.631]  Now they're closing 10 o'clock at night.
[01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:11.451]  Eating my food.
[01:41:11.451 --> 01:41:16.392]  I'm by myself watching a guy mop.
[01:41:16.392 --> 01:41:22.313]  And it was like, where the, like the walls just go off and you're like, whoa.
[01:41:22.313 --> 01:41:25.813]  It's like, I'm in a presence.
[01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:28.234]  And I was commissioned, my second commission right there.
[01:41:28.956 --> 01:41:37.384]  I got commissioned about four years before that, like, spiritually, that this is a mission, you gotta get yourself straight, you gotta get ready, I got something really important for you.
[01:41:37.384 --> 01:41:45.531]  This next one was like, you're gonna absolutely expose the New World Order, you're gonna dominate, you're gonna get totally attacked, and you gotta be ready.
[01:41:45.531 --> 01:41:49.194]  God didn't say you're gonna be destroyed, but God said you gotta be ready to be destroyed.
[01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.991]  We're good to go.
[01:42:09.184 --> 01:42:17.128]  And I mean, it was like a download, like David Icke talks about when he was in Peru and Machu Picchu and he gets to the top and he's like, falls down for three hours, having convulsions.
[01:42:17.128 --> 01:42:18.569]  He's with some of his crew members.
[01:42:18.569 --> 01:42:23.151]  He was the head of the Green Party then, you know, the top BBC presenter all over the world.
[01:42:23.151 --> 01:42:25.773]  And he was like Walter Cronkite.
[01:42:25.773 --> 01:42:32.796]  And he's like on the ground for three hours, no drugs, you know, basically getting this vision.
[01:42:32.796 --> 01:42:33.957]  But it wasn't like that.
[01:42:33.957 --> 01:42:37.399]  It was just like being like, like the walls.
[01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:47.679]  I don't want to use this analogy because I'm not a demon, but have you seen in Golden Child when the demon goes in and the walls go away when he's talking to Satan getting his orders?
[01:42:47.679 --> 01:42:48.520]  It was like that.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.442]  But it wasn't... I wasn't in hell.
[01:42:50.442 --> 01:42:55.107]  It was like the walls just go... And I was like, oh boy!
[01:42:55.107 --> 01:42:57.871]  And it was like, now you're given the choice.
[01:42:59.548 --> 01:43:06.310]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:09.950]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:19.453]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of meat pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[01:43:19.453 --> 01:43:20.633]  It's about to sell out.
[01:43:20.633 --> 01:43:22.053]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.221]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:46:03.221 --> 01:46:08.443]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullmorestore.com.
[01:46:08.443 --> 01:46:20.786]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:46:20.786 --> 01:46:23.947]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:46:24.967 --> 01:46:25.427]  Thanks for watching!
[01:46:44.657 --> 01:46:49.382]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:13.487 --> 01:47:21.393]  The spiritual realm is a trillion times more real than this realm we live in.
[01:47:21.393 --> 01:47:24.895]  The enemy knows their time is short.
[01:47:24.895 --> 01:47:27.157]  Great decisions are now to be made.
[01:47:27.157 --> 01:47:32.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:37.424]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:41.453]  God is not going to leave us alone against this evil.
[01:47:41.453 --> 01:47:43.241]  We have to call on God with the power to defeat it.
[01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:27.271]  You were wise to kill Tommy Tongue.
[01:48:27.271 --> 01:48:28.432]  He was weak.
[01:48:28.432 --> 01:48:30.753]  He might have betrayed us.
[01:48:30.753 --> 01:48:32.074]  Thank you, Lord.
[01:48:32.074 --> 01:48:35.695]  But why is the child still alive?
[01:48:35.695 --> 01:48:36.996]  You have no reason to fear him.
[01:48:37.856 --> 01:48:42.180]  He is surrounded at all times and in all of four directions by evil.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:47.445]  Do not underestimate the power of good and do not dismiss the strength of the child.
[01:48:47.445 --> 01:48:48.926]  Time grows short.
[01:48:48.926 --> 01:48:50.828]  The child will never eat the blood.
[01:48:50.828 --> 01:48:52.129]  What must I do?
[01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:55.192]  Move the child before the chosen one draws near.
[01:48:56.281 --> 01:48:57.361]  And to kill him?
[01:48:57.361 --> 01:48:59.322]  The Ajanti Dagger.
[01:48:59.322 --> 01:49:01.262]  It is not of this world.
[01:49:01.262 --> 01:49:02.923]  With it, you could kill the child.
[01:49:02.923 --> 01:49:04.343]  But Lord, it is so well guarded.
[01:49:04.343 --> 01:49:06.984]  How can I... Offer to exchange the child for it?
[01:49:06.984 --> 01:49:10.504]  They can refuse nothing for a safe return.
[01:49:10.504 --> 01:49:12.605]  Use the Ajanti Dagger.
[01:49:12.605 --> 01:49:16.146]  With it, you need no other evil.
[01:49:16.146 --> 01:49:19.146]  Use the dagger to kill the child.
[01:49:23.311 --> 01:49:25.252]  And then they save you from the death they're dealing.
[01:49:25.252 --> 01:49:28.934]  They're there to protect you from the death of the planet they are creating.
[01:49:28.934 --> 01:49:29.334]  Alright.
[01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:54.790]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:49:54.790 --> 01:50:01.893]  Mark, LJ, Zachary, Craig, Wayne, Matt, E, Jack, Amber, Blandy, Maxwell.
[01:50:01.893 --> 01:50:02.794]  I'll take your calls.
[01:50:02.794 --> 01:50:04.274]  The order they are received.
[01:50:04.274 --> 01:50:07.335]  Looks like the oldest caller is Craig, and then Maxwell.
[01:50:07.335 --> 01:50:10.456]  We'll go to you in just a second.
[01:50:10.456 --> 01:50:16.359]  But if you want evidence of them coming after our children, oh, these three stacks right here are incredible.
[01:50:16.359 --> 01:50:19.640]  And why are they bringing out Obama's homosexuality right now?
[01:50:20.865 --> 01:50:23.987]  We'll be laying that out bottom of the next hour.
[01:50:23.987 --> 01:50:32.214]  But right now, I have said I'm here to take your calls, and I am here to take your calls.
[01:50:32.214 --> 01:50:36.557]  Let's go ahead and go to who's been holding the longest again.
[01:50:36.557 --> 01:50:39.179]  That'd be Wayne, actually, and then Jack.
[01:50:39.179 --> 01:50:40.560]  Wayne in Texas.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:41.841]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:50:41.841 --> 01:50:43.642]  Go ahead.
[01:50:43.642 --> 01:50:44.203]  Hey, Alex.
[01:50:44.203 --> 01:50:45.364]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:50:47.717 --> 01:50:56.879]  Just to edify our, you know, brothers and sisters in Christ, I just want to say that, you know, Cain said two things, you know, in a way that kind of condemned himself.
[01:50:56.879 --> 01:51:02.301]  And that's that he asked if he was his brother's keeper and implied that he wasn't snarkily.
[01:51:02.301 --> 01:51:05.841]  And he also said that his burden was greater than he could bear.
[01:51:05.841 --> 01:51:13.463]  And, you know, I just want to remind everybody, you know, that, you know, Christ came to do both of those, to be his brother's keeper and to bear our sins.
[01:51:13.463 --> 01:51:13.863]  That's right.
[01:51:13.863 --> 01:51:15.144]  We can't defeat Satan.
[01:51:15.144 --> 01:51:15.804]  Only Christ can.
[01:51:16.852 --> 01:51:18.633]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:51:18.633 --> 01:51:22.595]  He is the author and finisher of our thing.
[01:51:22.595 --> 01:51:30.218]  And the other thing I wanted to talk about is the Business Roundtable, the non-profit lobbyist association made up exclusively of
[01:51:31.245 --> 01:51:33.266]  CEO's in Washington DC.
[01:51:33.266 --> 01:51:41.652]  Yeah, that's how they gave the order three and a half years ago to put QR codes in to get your menu was all to train you for the digital currency QR code to buy and sell.
[01:51:41.652 --> 01:51:42.552]  They admit it.
[01:51:42.552 --> 01:51:49.876]  So they make one order at the IMF and World Bank through the WHO, the UN, and every major business followed it.
[01:51:49.876 --> 01:51:50.937]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:50.937 --> 01:51:51.517]  Absolutely.
[01:51:51.517 --> 01:51:58.862]  And ironically, you know, Washington Post in 2010 said the business roundtable was Barack Obama's
[01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:01.940]  Closest business partner and ally.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:15.168]  And they, you know, in 2019, ironically, before COVID-19, they changed their policy of putting shareholder interest above all else to stakeholder interest above all else.
[01:52:15.168 --> 01:52:28.136]  And I mean, when you have a lobbyist group made up exclusively of CEOs in Washington, D.C., with that much political power to where they can be referenced as a president of the United States' closest business ally,
[01:52:29.369 --> 01:52:33.091]  Putting their interests above their shareholders.
[01:52:33.091 --> 01:52:35.351]  I mean, no, no wonder.
[01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:36.632]  And that's why they continue.
[01:52:36.632 --> 01:52:37.992]  And you've got $15 trillion.
[01:52:37.992 --> 01:52:41.474]  You just kamikaze brands into us.
[01:52:41.474 --> 01:52:42.034]  Absolutely.
[01:52:42.034 --> 01:52:52.218]  And not only that, like if you look at Doug McMillan, the chairman of Walmart, for instance, in 2015, he contested the religious freedom bill.
[01:52:52.218 --> 01:52:56.780]  He petitioned against it to Asa Hutchinson, the governor at that point in time.
[01:52:57.503 --> 01:53:14.777]  Under the premise that it was against the spirit of inclusion, you know, which essentially, I mean, it says in itself that comparison that, you know, diversity, inclusion, and equity, you know, which is what they're really... Corporations are at war with us.
[01:53:14.777 --> 01:53:16.318]  Thank you, Wayne.
[01:53:16.318 --> 01:53:17.759]  Next up, Craig in Ohio.
[01:53:17.759 --> 01:53:25.045]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:53:25.045 --> 01:53:25.786]  Craig, you're on the air.
[01:53:25.786 --> 01:53:26.066]  Go ahead.
[01:53:28.595 --> 01:53:30.156]  All right.
[01:53:30.156 --> 01:53:32.317]  Put him on hold, see if he comes back, or let him go.
[01:53:32.317 --> 01:53:33.837]  Let's go to Jake in Wisconsin.
[01:53:33.837 --> 01:53:36.559]  Jake, go ahead.
[01:53:36.559 --> 01:53:38.479]  Hey, how you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:53:38.479 --> 01:53:40.600]  I wanted to talk about the wildfires.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.521]  Yes.
[01:53:41.521 --> 01:53:45.743]  And, like, specifically the different technologies you were talking about with lasers.
[01:53:45.743 --> 01:53:50.425]  I totally agree with you, but, like, you know, this thing, there's many ways it's going to wrap it.
[01:53:50.425 --> 01:53:57.548]  And, like, online, you can see, like, small single-engine and dual-engine airplanes with lasers.
[01:54:00.332 --> 01:54:06.674]  Yes, there are directed energy weapons and they can be directed by ships, planes, handheld, you name it.
[01:54:06.674 --> 01:54:12.915]  But a lighter and gasoline, you need high wind, and then they just light fires and then it burns everything down.
[01:54:12.915 --> 01:54:17.497]  We've caught them, they're being arrested by the thousands and the media suppresses it.
[01:54:17.497 --> 01:54:20.858]  We're catching them!
[01:54:20.858 --> 01:54:27.980]  There's lots of photoshopped laser stuff, and I'm not saying that isn't going on, but we're catching the left burning things down everywhere.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:39.387]  There's a lot of burning going on, like it says in the Bible, you know, and I'm not discounting, but arson, I think arson is like, very common, you know, even on in history.
[01:54:39.387 --> 01:54:45.433]  This is leftist directed, globalist directed arson.
[01:54:45.433 --> 01:54:45.953]  Yep.
[01:54:45.953 --> 01:54:57.263]  And then like, also there was Tesla technology that uses the earth to build up a charge, and then a laser just guides the electrical charge.
[01:54:58.532 --> 01:55:01.733]  Sir, I know there's all of that, and you're absolutely right.
[01:55:01.733 --> 01:55:05.674]  But they've caught thousands of them, Antifa and leftists.
[01:55:05.674 --> 01:55:09.875]  It's in the police report, setting fires, and that gets suppressed.
[01:55:09.875 --> 01:55:17.578]  Why would you use an expensive plane or a satellite when you can, through these cut-out groups, have leftists go be told where to set fires at what time?
[01:55:17.578 --> 01:55:21.799]  They get a call, they're told where to go on a GPS mark, and they set a fire.
[01:55:24.591 --> 01:55:28.215]  Yeah, yeah, and also fires can be caused by lightning and natural waves.
[01:55:28.215 --> 01:55:35.224]  No, there are some real fires going on, but they've been busting them doing it.
[01:55:35.224 --> 01:55:41.572]  Yeah, you know, and they do it for political gain also to control the area and they can buy up the property.
[01:55:42.242 --> 01:55:44.763]  Yeah, fireflies, you know, it's a very powerful weapon.
[01:55:44.763 --> 01:55:49.084]  Fire has been used in history, plus biblically, you know, it says if the world's going to be destroyed again, it's going to be with fire.
[01:56:10.009 --> 01:56:11.649]  And literally the world's burning.
[01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:13.970]  And what have the Democrats been telling you?
[01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:16.151]  Oh, the global warm is going to cause all these fires.
[01:56:16.151 --> 01:56:21.672]  They know exactly what the governor of Hawaii is blaming global warming for this.
[01:56:21.672 --> 01:56:24.493]  It is high winds and people setting fire.
[01:56:24.493 --> 01:56:27.513]  They've arrested people that were doing it, but it's being suppressed.
[01:56:27.513 --> 01:56:29.114]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:29.114 --> 01:56:30.094]  Maxwell in Ohio.
[01:56:30.094 --> 01:56:30.674]  You're on the air.
[01:56:30.674 --> 01:56:32.195]  Welcome.
[01:56:32.195 --> 01:56:34.535]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:34.535 --> 01:56:36.856]  I've been watching you for about 13 years.
[01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:37.656]  Found you on YouTube.
[01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:42.452]  Uh, first time caller, um, here's the thing.
[01:56:42.452 --> 01:56:52.479]  When Klaus Schwab goes up there and talks about, you know, the central bank, digital currencies, and the social credit scores, you know, all the leftists, they think that, oh, it's going to be UBI.
[01:56:52.479 --> 01:56:53.820]  It's going to be, I'm going to get a paycheck.
[01:56:55.515 --> 01:57:00.778]  In communist China, if you don't go to work, they ship you to a forced labor camp, just like they do with the Uyghur Muslims.
[01:57:00.778 --> 01:57:02.859]  Tell you what, I don't want to cut you off.
[01:57:02.859 --> 01:57:03.779]  Don't hang up, Maxwell.
[01:57:03.779 --> 01:57:04.379]  I'll put you on hold.
[01:57:04.379 --> 01:57:07.101]  I'm going to come back to you in like two minutes after break.
[01:57:07.101 --> 01:57:08.041]  Absolutely.
[01:57:08.041 --> 01:57:10.422]  The leftists believe they're about to get a free paycheck.
[01:57:10.422 --> 01:57:14.324]  They're being given free goodies while they're domesticated, while they're trained.
[01:57:14.324 --> 01:57:22.968]  But it's like a mouse thinking a piece of cheese on a mousetrap is a gift, or a bear thinking a piece of blueberry pie on a bear trap is a gift.
[01:57:22.968 --> 01:57:24.709]  Now you're about to put your leg in the trap.
[01:57:26.169 --> 01:57:27.650]  And that's what's so pathetic about them.
[01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:33.473]  They literally think they're about to build a utopia, as if these megabanks and these cold-blooded warmongers care about them.
[01:57:33.473 --> 01:57:36.414]  They are delusional fools.
[01:57:36.414 --> 01:57:42.397]  We'll be right back with hour number three with Maxwell, Mark, and many others straight ahead.
[01:57:42.397 --> 01:57:43.618]  Have you shared the link?
[01:57:43.618 --> 01:57:49.200]  Infowars.com for victory.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:54.063]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.
[01:57:54.878 --> 01:57:55.038]  I don't
[01:58:17.406 --> 01:58:19.167]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[01:58:19.167 --> 01:58:21.869]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[01:58:21.869 --> 01:58:25.511]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[01:58:25.511 --> 01:58:31.095]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[01:58:31.095 --> 01:58:33.917]  It's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:58:33.917 --> 01:58:35.018]  And here's what's even crazier.
[01:58:36.198 --> 01:58:37.679]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:58:37.679 --> 01:58:40.942]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:58:40.942 --> 01:58:45.304]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[01:58:45.304 --> 01:58:46.085]  Rebels in.
[01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:49.707]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now.
[01:58:49.707 --> 01:58:54.751]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[01:58:55.976 --> 01:58:58.738]  Supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy.
[01:58:58.738 --> 01:59:05.083]  We could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[01:59:05.083 --> 01:59:06.164]  But now we've got it.
[01:59:06.164 --> 01:59:08.726]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[01:59:08.726 --> 01:59:10.147]  We've got a limited shipment.
[01:59:10.147 --> 01:59:11.828]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[01:59:11.828 --> 01:59:17.873]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,
[01:59:18.573 --> 01:59:21.295]  High quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer.
[01:59:21.295 --> 01:59:27.278]  We have it right now private labeled under the name Silver Bullet at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:27.278 --> 01:59:29.659]  Limited supply, 30% off.
[01:59:29.659 --> 01:59:32.601]  InfoWarStore.com Silver Bullet.

[01:59:42.267 --> 01:59:43.527]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:55.275]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.275 --> 01:59:56.577]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:19.774 --> 02:00:23.417]  There have been some huge developments on the Trump 4th indictment in Georgia.
[02:00:23.417 --> 02:00:24.899]  We're co-editing those now.
[02:00:24.899 --> 02:00:25.819]  We'll cover them next segment.
[02:00:25.819 --> 02:00:28.181]  Let's go back to Maxwell in Ohio.
[02:00:28.181 --> 02:00:28.922]  Maxwell, start over.
[02:00:28.922 --> 02:00:29.923]  You got cut off of the break.
[02:00:29.923 --> 02:00:32.285]  Make your point.
[02:00:32.285 --> 02:00:33.066]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:33.066 --> 02:00:41.493]  I'm just, you know, Klaus Schwab and the WEF and all these people, you know, they talk about the central bank digital currencies and, you know, the social credit scores.
[02:00:42.438 --> 02:00:49.380]  You know, in Communist China, if you don't go to work, you go to a forced labor camp with the Uyghur Muslims, and they, you know, you can go for 5, 10 years or until you die.
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:53.921]  A lot of people, you know, they go to the camps and die.
[02:00:53.921 --> 02:00:57.342]  It's not going to be, you know, all rainbows.
[02:00:57.342 --> 02:01:04.984]  So, we have to realize that, and basically, you have to resist.
[02:01:04.984 --> 02:01:05.884]  You can't go along with it.
[02:01:06.553 --> 02:01:08.835]  You know, you can't sign up for it very soon.
[02:01:08.835 --> 02:01:09.395]  The U.S.
[02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:11.137]  government's really going to push for it.
[02:01:11.137 --> 02:01:13.218]  As you see, they released it, I believe, two weeks ago.
[02:01:13.218 --> 02:01:16.081]  It's already here.
[02:01:16.081 --> 02:01:16.661]  It's not coming.
[02:01:16.661 --> 02:01:17.162]  It's here.
[02:01:17.162 --> 02:01:19.804]  We're already about probably 90% there.
[02:01:19.804 --> 02:01:21.585]  I think you'd agree with that, Alex?
[02:01:21.585 --> 02:01:22.726]  No, I agree.
[02:01:22.726 --> 02:01:24.007]  We're in Agenda 2030.
[02:01:24.007 --> 02:01:31.293]  They are already cutting off the nitrogen fertilizer, already shutting down the third world, already doing all this.
[02:01:31.293 --> 02:01:33.235]  It's already going to be devastation.
[02:01:33.235 --> 02:01:35.917]  And they're going to go, oh, it's global warming.
[02:01:35.917 --> 02:01:36.057]  Yeah.
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.761]  So the last step is collapse the dollar and then it's over.
[02:01:40.761 --> 02:01:43.261]  But, um, one more thing I want to hit.
[02:01:43.261 --> 02:01:50.723]  Um, I have friends and family who are vaccine injured, um, bad, put it like that.
[02:01:50.723 --> 02:01:52.704]  And I was just looking at young and old.
[02:01:52.704 --> 02:01:55.924]  I was just looking at Dr. Peter McCullough's Twitter last night.
[02:01:55.924 --> 02:02:00.405]  He retweeted some data about people, uh, ages zero to 25.
[02:02:00.405 --> 02:02:02.246]  I'm 24.
[02:02:02.246 --> 02:02:03.106]  Never took the Vax.
[02:02:03.106 --> 02:02:03.646]  Of course, you know,
[02:02:04.676 --> 02:02:09.458]  But, all my friends ask me, well, Max, how did you know three and a half years ago, three years ago, the vaccine would be bad?
[02:02:09.458 --> 02:02:20.323]  Well, um, I remember watching you and the health ranger, Mike Adams, on air, reviewing the studies of the mice and I believe the other rodent, where they all died in six, seven.
[02:02:20.323 --> 02:02:27.106]  And you, and you broke it down on air, the math, and it was like nine times, 10 times earlier than the lifespan that they should have died.
[02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:28.727]  And it's like, how'd you know that?
[02:02:28.727 --> 02:02:32.769]  Well, and then I looked at, you know, uh, the
[02:02:34.324 --> 02:02:39.929]  MRNA creator, Robert Malone, he told everyone not to take it.
[02:02:39.929 --> 02:02:42.531]  The HIV doctor, he said it was a man-made virus.
[02:02:42.531 --> 02:02:43.672]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[02:02:43.672 --> 02:02:44.753]  I could go for hours.
[02:02:44.753 --> 02:02:47.195]  Yeah, Luke Montier, the Nobel Prize winner.
[02:02:47.195 --> 02:02:48.436]  Yeah, no.
[02:02:48.436 --> 02:02:53.219]  The former chief science officer of Pfizer, Michael Yudon.
[02:02:53.219 --> 02:03:00.005]  The FDA's own document in October 2000 saying it would cause myocarditis and heart attacks and blood clots and strokes.
[02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:02.587]  I mean, yeah, it's just, it's insane.
[02:03:02.587 --> 02:03:03.708]  If you think that's insane,
[02:03:05.248 --> 02:03:11.853]  Wait till you see what we're about to break next segment.
[02:03:11.853 --> 02:03:13.594]  You talk about insane, brother.
[02:03:13.594 --> 02:03:18.158]  Wait till you hear what happened with the Trump indictment.
[02:03:18.158 --> 02:03:19.659]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[02:03:19.659 --> 02:03:21.260]  This is crazy town.
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:21.981]  Anything else, brother?
[02:03:21.981 --> 02:03:28.365]  Yeah, one more thing on the Trump thing.
[02:03:28.365 --> 02:03:31.247]  Economically, Alex, I'm kind of on the left.
[02:03:31.247 --> 02:03:34.710]  I do think social programs are good, but here's the thing.
[02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:42.973]  The Republican Party, you know, Trump goes up there with Lindsey Graham, Matt Gaetz, McConnell, you name it.
[02:03:42.973 --> 02:03:44.713]  They're not really likable people.
[02:03:44.713 --> 02:03:52.255]  The Republican Party, we have to get, you know, likable people in there, rock stars of the party, to get people to vote for us, vote for that party, and get things going.
[02:03:52.255 --> 02:03:55.376]  Well, look how Trump appointed the U.S.
[02:03:55.376 --> 02:03:58.796]  Attorney that's now the special prosecutor that covered up for Hunter.
[02:03:58.796 --> 02:03:59.597]  I agree.
[02:03:59.597 --> 02:04:00.677]  Trump screwed the poach, man.
[02:04:01.576 --> 02:04:05.338]  I mean, you're not... and the Republican Party is a bunch of blue-blood country club elitists.
[02:04:05.338 --> 02:04:07.559]  I gotcha.
[02:04:07.559 --> 02:04:10.901]  But I think the Democratic Party, I don't think I know, is the forward foot of this.
[02:04:10.901 --> 02:04:12.102]  They're the leading edge.
[02:04:12.102 --> 02:04:15.244]  They're the most corrupt, out-of-control, crazy town group.
[02:04:15.244 --> 02:04:17.385]  I mean, don't you agree with that?
[02:04:17.385 --> 02:04:18.225]  Oh, 100%.
[02:04:18.225 --> 02:04:23.868]  But it's just, they're both horrible, but we gotta get some sort of... Watch out like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., brother.
[02:04:23.868 --> 02:04:26.290]  I'd love to see the Democratic Party reformed.
[02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:27.070]  Love him, yeah.
[02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:27.610]  Yeah.
[02:04:27.610 --> 02:04:29.311]  We're on the same page, brother.
[02:04:29.311 --> 02:04:29.752]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:04:31.627 --> 02:04:34.650]  I mean, I just want to have prosperity and security, not World War III.
[02:04:34.650 --> 02:04:35.931]  That's real simple.
[02:04:35.931 --> 02:04:38.634]  Okay, folks.
[02:04:38.634 --> 02:04:39.334]  This is breaking.
[02:04:39.334 --> 02:04:41.977]  This is confirmed, okay?
[02:04:41.977 --> 02:04:47.402]  They just broke the law in front of everybody with the Trump indictment in Georgia.
[02:04:47.402 --> 02:04:52.506]  The idiots released the indictment before the grand jury did, showing how it's a rubber stamp.
[02:04:52.506 --> 02:04:53.807]  This is so huge.
[02:04:53.807 --> 02:04:54.788]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.

[02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:49.551]  Spread the word.
[02:05:49.551 --> 02:05:50.331]  Pray for the broadcast.

[02:06:16.395 --> 02:06:17.516]  InfoWars.
[02:06:17.516 --> 02:06:18.696]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:06:18.696 --> 02:06:19.037]  Today.
[02:06:21.357 --> 02:06:28.861]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[02:06:28.861 --> 02:06:39.146]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[02:06:39.955 --> 02:06:46.580]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:51.063]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:07.733]  Whether it's war, suppression of free speech, pharmacological interventions that are mandatory, whatever it is.
[02:07:07.733 --> 02:07:10.754]  That used to all be associated with the authoritative right.
[02:07:10.754 --> 02:07:12.114]  The authoritarian right.
[02:07:12.114 --> 02:07:14.755]  And now those things are being embraced by the left.
[02:07:14.755 --> 02:07:17.356]  And I think it's just an ideology thing.
[02:07:17.356 --> 02:07:20.257]  I think we get confused and we think, we're on the right side.
[02:07:20.257 --> 02:07:21.078]  We're on the right side.
[02:07:21.078 --> 02:07:23.538]  And if it's our side that's saying this, for sure it's the right thing to do.
[02:07:23.538 --> 02:07:24.979]  And no one's critically thinking about this.
[02:07:29.329 --> 02:07:30.650]  All right, hold on to your hats.
[02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:32.150]  We got this about 20 minutes ago.
[02:07:32.150 --> 02:07:32.771]  We checked it.
[02:07:32.771 --> 02:07:33.271]  It's true.
[02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:36.372]  This is such a big moment.
[02:07:36.372 --> 02:07:46.997]  Just to add a cherry on top and some nuts on top of the whipped cream of lawless, one-sided justice, rigged courts.
[02:07:46.997 --> 02:07:57.803]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Soros-funded gang member-supporting, defund-the-police,
[02:07:58.945 --> 02:08:02.686]  New World Order Minion in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:08:02.686 --> 02:08:07.867]  We see everywhere it's set to indict today or tomorrow President Trump.
[02:08:07.867 --> 02:08:13.628]  But they said the grand jury had to meet one more time to decide today whether they would indict.
[02:08:13.628 --> 02:08:15.268]  But they jumped the gun.
[02:08:15.268 --> 02:08:18.409]  They fired the starter pistol too early.
[02:08:18.409 --> 02:08:25.251]  And they published the indictment online in the last two hours.
[02:08:25.251 --> 02:08:26.931]  That had not been officially issued
[02:08:28.143 --> 02:08:30.845]  And the media, it turns out, now has the indictment.
[02:08:30.845 --> 02:08:47.337]  I made that point a few weeks ago with the January 6th indictment that MSNBC said, oh, it's just now breaking and then did a whole coverage with graphics and all the information with their legal analysts that clearly took days to get ready for.
[02:08:51.812 --> 02:08:57.279]  Violation of the Georgia RICO Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organization Act.
[02:08:57.279 --> 02:08:58.281]  That's one of the indictments.
[02:08:58.281 --> 02:09:01.765]  Solicitation and violation of oath by public officer.
[02:09:01.765 --> 02:09:05.030]  Conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer.
[02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.811]  Conspiracy to commit...
[02:09:06.772 --> 02:09:08.954]  Forgery in the first degree.
[02:09:08.954 --> 02:09:12.397]  Conspiracy to commit false statements and writings.
[02:09:12.397 --> 02:09:15.680]  Conspiracy to commit filing false documents.
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:17.502]  You're seeing the document, folks.
[02:09:17.502 --> 02:09:21.125]  Conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree.
[02:09:21.125 --> 02:09:24.148]  Conspiracy to commit false statements and writings.
[02:09:24.148 --> 02:09:25.028]  City challenged an election.
[02:09:25.028 --> 02:09:25.849]  It's false.
[02:09:25.849 --> 02:09:27.090]  Filing false documents.
[02:09:27.090 --> 02:09:29.933]  Solicitation of violation of the oath by public officer.
[02:09:29.933 --> 02:09:31.835]  They're making it illegal to challenge their steals.
[02:09:32.722 --> 02:09:35.544]  Just look at trying to block Trump his way ahead in the polls from running.
[02:09:35.544 --> 02:09:38.846]  Solicitation of violation of the oath by public officer.
[02:09:38.846 --> 02:09:41.448]  False statements and writings.
[02:09:41.448 --> 02:09:42.989]  False statements and writings?
[02:09:42.989 --> 02:09:44.150]  That's only a federal statute.
[02:09:44.150 --> 02:09:46.031]  The feds.
[02:09:46.031 --> 02:09:52.415]  This document was posted online by the Fulton County, Georgia's DA office and then quickly taken down.
[02:09:52.415 --> 02:09:53.676]  Defendant Donald Trump.
[02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:57.642]  You look at Biden, he can barely talk.
[02:09:57.642 --> 02:10:05.367]  You look at them, they've got the Justice Department, they've got the media, but they're all a bunch of losers, most of them on drugs.
[02:10:05.367 --> 02:10:08.289]  They screwed the pooch.
[02:10:08.289 --> 02:10:15.654]  They claimed the grand jury was meeting today to decide whether to indict him, and they released the indictment early.
[02:10:15.654 --> 02:10:20.537]  The staged, synthetic, plastic, fraudulent document.
[02:10:22.403 --> 02:10:26.504]  I mean, that right there is just prison time.
[02:10:26.504 --> 02:10:28.305]  They already had the indictment ready.
[02:10:28.305 --> 02:10:30.165]  The grand jury hadn't even greenlit it.
[02:10:30.165 --> 02:10:32.266]  They told the world they hadn't greenlit it.
[02:10:32.266 --> 02:10:34.487]  They were building suspense.
[02:10:34.487 --> 02:10:36.127]  And they jumped the gun.
[02:10:36.127 --> 02:10:37.728]  They screwed the pooch.
[02:10:37.728 --> 02:10:38.768]  They released it.
[02:10:40.467 --> 02:10:41.928]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:10:41.928 --> 02:10:43.328]  What's Cernovich have to say about it?
[02:10:43.328 --> 02:10:44.189]  Mike Cernovich.
[02:10:44.189 --> 02:10:48.711]  Trump was indicted before the grand jury closed.
[02:10:48.711 --> 02:10:51.072]  Trump was indicted before.
[02:10:51.072 --> 02:10:53.693]  B-E-F-O-R-E.
[02:10:53.693 --> 02:11:01.497]  Trump was indicted before the grand jury closed.
[02:11:01.497 --> 02:11:03.838]  That's how rigged it is.
[02:11:03.838 --> 02:11:09.541]  George, the Attorney General, needs to be taken over immediately.
[02:11:10.717 --> 02:11:33.882]  The since-removed document cited charges including violation of the Georgia-RICO Racketeering Influence Corruption Organization Act, solicitation of violation of oath of public officer, conspiracy to commit false statements and writings, and conspiracy to commit forgery for trying to conduct an investigation that's now been confirmed that dead people and illegals were voting.
[02:11:33.882 --> 02:11:36.623]  Fulton County DA indicted Trump under Georgia's RICO law.
[02:11:37.199 --> 02:11:38.380]  Reuters obtained the documents.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:40.201]  The grand jury is still meeting.
[02:11:40.201 --> 02:11:45.464]  This law is not being followed.
[02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:46.985]  The law is not being followed.
[02:11:46.985 --> 02:11:53.188]  This is state-sponsored lynching.
[02:11:53.188 --> 02:11:57.150]  Wow.
[02:11:57.150 --> 02:12:00.112]  And remember, they had the jury forewoman.
[02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:01.553]  In fact, cue up the audio of that lunatic.
[02:12:03.184 --> 02:12:07.968]  Bragging about the power trip she had, having Trump under her power.
[02:12:07.968 --> 02:12:10.190]  Under her control.
[02:12:10.190 --> 02:12:12.672]  How wonderful it was.
[02:12:12.672 --> 02:12:18.437]  How much she enjoyed it.
[02:12:18.437 --> 02:12:21.479]  Totally illegal.
[02:12:21.479 --> 02:12:23.901]  On its face.
[02:12:23.901 --> 02:12:25.542]  Try to get Robert Barnes on.
[02:12:25.542 --> 02:12:27.844]  I'll commandeer the fourth hour.
[02:12:27.844 --> 02:12:30.827]  Or get me... This is just... This is just mind-blowing right now.
[02:12:32.984 --> 02:12:36.566]  Call Cernovich, see if he'll pop on via Skype or Zoom.
[02:12:36.566 --> 02:12:42.991]  I mean, this is just, he's a lawyer too, this is incredible.
[02:12:42.991 --> 02:13:00.502]  After all the crime they've committed, after everything they said Trump did, they did, after all their, after them staging January 6th, they get caught saying, oh, the grand jury's meeting to sign a Vilton indict today, and then they jump the gun, illegally leaking,
[02:13:02.051 --> 02:13:05.254]  And put out the signed indictment papers by the grand jury.
[02:13:05.254 --> 02:13:18.645]  That'd be like if you were in a criminal trial or civil trial, and the judge goes, the jury will now go to the deliberations.
[02:13:18.645 --> 02:13:26.632]  And somebody goes, wait, your honor, it's already in the news that the jury said he's guilty!
[02:13:26.632 --> 02:13:29.374]  It'd be mistrial instantly.
[02:13:30.646 --> 02:13:33.467]  Listen to this power-tripping lunatic.
[02:13:56.567 --> 02:14:01.189]  So these aren't people stealing our right to vote, taking our top candidate away.
[02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:02.730]  It's not somebody facing prison.
[02:14:02.730 --> 02:14:03.450]  It's not a real human.
[02:14:03.450 --> 02:14:04.791]  It's fun!
[02:14:04.791 --> 02:14:06.612]  Like it's a video game.
[02:14:06.612 --> 02:14:07.912]  Let's stomp on people.
[02:14:07.912 --> 02:14:09.813]  Let's hurt people.
[02:14:09.813 --> 02:14:12.755]  Let's lie about people.
[02:14:12.755 --> 02:14:14.235]  That's their face.
[02:14:14.235 --> 02:14:15.556]  Deranged.
[02:14:15.556 --> 02:14:16.656]  Dangerous.
[02:14:16.656 --> 02:14:18.997]  Lunatics.
[02:14:18.997 --> 02:14:24.260]  Who've been given a green light to do whatever they want to humanity.
[02:14:30.973 --> 02:14:37.074]  If you just tuned in, this is next level.
[02:14:37.074 --> 02:14:47.557]  They published, hours ago, his indictment on the website before the grand jury handed down the indictment and had their vote, knowing it was rigged.
[02:14:47.557 --> 02:14:50.958]  They've been caught with their pants down.
[02:14:50.958 --> 02:14:54.719]  But just like Hunter Biden's laptop, I'll meet with the top Chinese intelligence agent.
[02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:56.259]  My dad gets me the jobs.
[02:14:56.259 --> 02:14:58.220]  They've got 40-something billion dollars.
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:14:59.680]  I'll work for Chinese intelligence.
[02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:07.578]  And they just blocked that information.
[02:15:07.578 --> 02:15:10.582]  They blocked Hunter Biden information three years ago.
[02:15:11.613 --> 02:15:21.915]  And now they're doing it in reverse, publishing their fake indictment, leaking it that's a felony, and showing it's all rigged in front of the world.
[02:15:21.915 --> 02:15:32.157]  As long as Trump doesn't give up, as long as we don't give up, more of this haywire, cattywampus, derailment insanity is going to continue.
[02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:36.877]  But we can laugh about it, but I'm crying.
[02:15:36.877 --> 02:15:39.598]  Because these are a bunch of lawyers that have never been in a fistfight.
[02:15:41.039 --> 02:15:43.681]  Never actually worked a real job.
[02:15:43.681 --> 02:15:46.003]  And they're messing with Russia.
[02:15:46.003 --> 02:15:49.105]  It's got twice the nuclear weapons we got.
[02:15:49.105 --> 02:15:53.949]  And launching drone attacks on Moscow.
[02:15:53.949 --> 02:15:57.191]  It's a bunch of lawyers sitting around and all want to act tough.
[02:15:57.191 --> 02:15:57.812]  Screw it!
[02:15:57.812 --> 02:15:58.953]  Let's attack the Russians!
[02:15:58.953 --> 02:15:59.353]  Yeah!
[02:15:59.353 --> 02:15:59.753]  Yeah!
[02:15:59.753 --> 02:15:59.953]  Yeah!
[02:15:59.953 --> 02:16:01.455]  Yeah!
[02:16:01.455 --> 02:16:03.676]  Let's overthrow the Ukrainian government nine years ago.
[02:16:03.676 --> 02:16:04.617]  Let's move troops in.
[02:16:04.617 --> 02:16:05.097]  I know U.S.
[02:16:05.097 --> 02:16:06.599]  troops are over there fighting the Russians.
[02:16:06.599 --> 02:16:08.440]  Let's start killing a bunch of Russians and push them out.
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:09.221]  Yeah, we're America!
[02:16:09.221 --> 02:16:09.601]  We can do it!
[02:16:12.509 --> 02:16:13.250]  They hate America.
[02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:15.692]  These leftists hate this country.
[02:16:15.692 --> 02:16:17.853]  And now they are starting.
[02:16:17.853 --> 02:16:21.176]  We're well started.
[02:16:21.176 --> 02:16:24.899]  World War 3.
[02:16:24.899 --> 02:16:27.741]  Better get our thinking caps on.
[02:16:27.741 --> 02:16:29.663]  Yeah, here's the former CIA directors.
[02:16:31.963 --> 02:16:35.485]  I saw a report last week that wasn't even denied by NATO that U.S.
[02:16:35.485 --> 02:16:45.792]  Blackhawks are flying in at 100 feet over the ground and delivering drone teams outside Moscow to launch drones and hit Moscow.
[02:16:45.792 --> 02:16:49.275]  Because the drones can't make it all the way 300 miles into Moscow.
[02:16:49.275 --> 02:16:50.195]  So U.S.
[02:16:50.195 --> 02:16:54.358]  Blackhawks, with all that special radar, right above the trees.
[02:16:54.358 --> 02:16:59.982]  The computer program takes over, it scans the radar, right above the trees.
[02:16:59.982 --> 02:17:00.883]  And they're coming in.
[02:17:02.554 --> 02:17:11.783]  And they drop off the Ukrainian team and they launch the drone and they jump back on the helicopter and come back in.
[02:17:11.783 --> 02:17:12.304]  U.S.
[02:17:12.304 --> 02:17:15.927]  pilots are in Russia attacking Moscow.
[02:17:15.927 --> 02:17:20.112]  That sounds real safe, doesn't it?
[02:17:20.112 --> 02:17:26.238]  And now China they sold us out to that controls most of Hollywood and most of our government.
[02:17:26.937 --> 02:17:29.739]  They're like, well we'll just blow you up too!
[02:17:29.739 --> 02:17:31.040]  We're lawyers!
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.621]  We're the CFR!
[02:17:32.621 --> 02:17:35.643]  We're Richard N. Haas and Joe Biden!
[02:17:35.643 --> 02:17:43.488]  Why, you Chinese got a problem with your 5,000 nuclear weapons and your 20 million man army?
[02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:44.789]  And all your operatives?
[02:17:44.789 --> 02:17:46.350]  We'll just blow you up!
[02:17:46.350 --> 02:17:50.673]  They want to start a fight with our farmers and our ranchers and the Russians and the Chinese!
[02:17:50.673 --> 02:17:53.715]  Because they're a bunch of lawyers!
[02:17:53.715 --> 02:17:54.656]  They're lawyers!
[02:17:57.844 --> 02:18:02.065]  Meanwhile, our military is a disgrace, and it's totally falling apart.
[02:18:02.065 --> 02:18:03.265]  All part of the larger plan.
[02:18:03.265 --> 02:18:09.787]  Like, we'll get rid of the troops, we'll do transgenderism and critical race theory, and we'll get the best people out, all the people that follow our orders.
[02:18:09.787 --> 02:18:13.148]  Like, well, we got over 20,000 transgenders in the U.S.
[02:18:13.148 --> 02:18:22.270]  military now, they reported last month, and they don't have to show up to drill, or follow any rules, and have special leave!
[02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:23.971]  But we're gonna whoop you Russians' ass.
[02:18:26.235 --> 02:18:35.582]  It's all part of the AI technocracy to bring us down and trick Russia and China into nuking us, which will get rid of the globalist main opposition.
[02:18:35.582 --> 02:18:54.877]  In the fictitious Terminator universe, Skynet gets control in the mid-2000s of the nuclear launch codes and decides that humanity itself is the threat to its hegemonic robot control.
[02:18:55.802 --> 02:18:57.843]  It's a hypothetic war game.
[02:18:57.843 --> 02:19:00.463]  Hypothetical.
[02:19:00.463 --> 02:19:20.449]  And so, the US launches a nuke strike under robot control of autonomous systems against the Russkies, who launch an attack on us, and then 95% of the world population is killed, and now Skynet only has to kill what's left of the humans.
[02:19:20.449 --> 02:19:22.589]  But that's a movie!
[02:19:22.589 --> 02:19:24.470]  With James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:19:26.598 --> 02:19:35.281]  This is the real world where they want to depopulate us by 90% and they believe a merge from their bunkers victorious to play God.
[02:19:35.281 --> 02:19:41.042]  And that's where we are right now.
[02:19:41.042 --> 02:19:42.403]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:19:42.403 --> 02:19:43.903]  We've got a special guest coming up.
[02:19:43.903 --> 02:19:45.804]  Mark in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[02:19:45.804 --> 02:19:47.845]  Go ahead.
[02:19:47.845 --> 02:19:49.525]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:19:49.525 --> 02:19:51.526]  Welcome.
[02:19:51.526 --> 02:19:55.727]  Hey, I was just wondering, have you ever heard of the conspiracy theory that
[02:19:56.397 --> 02:20:01.120]  The Germans left planet and has a breakaway society?
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:02.961]  Yeah, I mean, I know a lot about World War II.
[02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:04.442]  The Germans had a lot of theoretical stuff.
[02:20:04.442 --> 02:20:07.304]  They did too many, too many different tracks.
[02:20:07.304 --> 02:20:08.485]  We just followed the bombs.
[02:20:08.485 --> 02:20:08.865]  We got it.
[02:20:08.865 --> 02:20:11.347]  They were doing a whole bunch of tracks.
[02:20:11.347 --> 02:20:15.690]  But they did have jets first and did have theoretical atomics first.
[02:20:15.690 --> 02:20:20.573]  But as for the Germans having a moon base or an Antarctic base, I've seen no evidence of that.
[02:20:22.438 --> 02:20:28.803]  Yeah, that's what I'm kind of calling about because the Nazis had the Honobu and the Daiglek.
[02:20:28.803 --> 02:20:31.405]  Supposedly, the Daiglek was like a bell.
[02:20:31.405 --> 02:20:36.009]  Yeah, you're talking about a space-time continuum disruptor.
[02:20:36.009 --> 02:20:42.134]  Yeah, it was actually a propulsion system that they put into a reverse-engineered
[02:20:43.761 --> 02:20:47.046]  No, I mean, listen.
[02:20:47.046 --> 02:20:49.369]  Let me ask a question.
[02:20:49.369 --> 02:20:50.350]  That's all theoretical.
[02:20:50.350 --> 02:20:51.972]  I've never seen any real documents on it.
[02:20:51.972 --> 02:20:55.477]  You know what's real?
[02:20:55.477 --> 02:20:59.723]  You know who the head of the German space program was, right?
[02:21:01.815 --> 02:21:03.756]  Yeah, Werner Von Braun.
[02:21:03.756 --> 02:21:05.197]  Werner Von Braun.
[02:21:05.197 --> 02:21:06.538]  Good.
[02:21:06.538 --> 02:21:20.247]  And he had a program called the Silverbird that was a space shuttle, launched the same way ours was, that he designed, that would then drop atomic bombs on New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.
[02:21:20.247 --> 02:21:24.150]  And they were actually building a Silverbird by the end of World War II, and the U.S.
[02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:26.351]  captured that in Western Germany.
[02:21:26.351 --> 02:21:30.454]  It's like in the movie The Winter Soldier.
[02:21:31.613 --> 02:21:36.175]  Exactly, that's what you see in Winter Soldier, though the Silverbird didn't look like that.
[02:21:36.175 --> 02:21:40.617]  Anybody can pull up the Nazi Silverbird, you can see drawings of it.
[02:21:40.617 --> 02:21:47.541]  It was a larger silver craft with small wings, it was a space plane, that was going to be rigged with atomic bombs.
[02:21:47.541 --> 02:21:53.844]  But yeah, that's then put in the movie Winter Soldier, Captain America, yes.
[02:21:53.844 --> 02:22:00.387]  Yeah, so there's been a lot of whistleblowers, like Ken Bradley, Randy Kramer, who's been in the SSP.
[02:22:04.430 --> 02:22:13.952]  I've never seen any proof of that.
[02:22:13.952 --> 02:22:15.352]  There's an artist rendering of the Silverbird.
[02:22:15.352 --> 02:22:16.092]  That's what it looked like.
[02:22:16.092 --> 02:22:18.292]  It's a real thing they were building.
[02:22:18.292 --> 02:22:19.893]  That's what the space shuttle's based on.
[02:22:19.893 --> 02:22:21.953]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[02:22:21.953 --> 02:22:24.754]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Matty in New York.
[02:22:24.754 --> 02:22:25.434]  Thanks for holding, Matty.
[02:22:26.861 --> 02:22:30.222]  Sir, I just want to talk about how we could save this great nation.
[02:22:30.222 --> 02:22:31.982]  About simply coming together.
[02:22:31.982 --> 02:22:35.263]  We have to have nothing to do with our government, right?
[02:22:35.263 --> 02:22:37.983]  And we have to name the criminal organization.
[02:22:37.983 --> 02:22:41.664]  Instead of calling it the NWO, we're going to call it the Global Mafia.
[02:22:41.664 --> 02:22:43.164]  Name the players involved.
[02:22:43.164 --> 02:22:49.846]  Henry Kissinger, who took over our financial system, which is such a crime you can't even... I mean, I don't even know where to begin.
[02:22:49.846 --> 02:22:55.827]  And then hitting everybody that has been bribed by that fiat currency, which they just print out of thin air.
[02:22:56.883 --> 02:23:00.887]  That's right, they gave themselves control of the money and they bought it all up.
[02:23:00.887 --> 02:23:04.370]  Yeah, so why don't we come together peacefully, every regular person, right?
[02:23:04.370 --> 02:23:08.193]  We get together with our sheriffs, we get all the players, we list all their names.
[02:23:09.295 --> 02:23:20.021]  We have a multitude of crimes against humanity that they have committed and we just start with them and whether we get them extradited from our country or whatever it is, we need to press charges, right?
[02:23:20.021 --> 02:23:24.124]  Enough of this Tom Fenton, release the Kraken.
[02:23:24.124 --> 02:23:30.328]  No, we have to come together and press formal charges on these people in a field with nothing to do with our government.
[02:23:30.328 --> 02:23:31.869]  Our government is corrupted.
[02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:32.749]  They're blackmailed.
[02:23:32.749 --> 02:23:34.170]  They all take money from big donors.
[02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:35.731]  They're controlled by mega monopolies.
[02:23:36.175 --> 02:23:36.595]  We're good to go.
[02:23:54.207 --> 02:23:56.049]  We gotta put down our distractions.
[02:23:56.049 --> 02:23:57.370]  The people have to come together.
[02:23:57.370 --> 02:23:58.992]  Rand Paul's not going to save you.
[02:23:58.992 --> 02:24:00.614]  Donald Trump's not going to save you.
[02:24:00.614 --> 02:24:01.255]  Joe Biden.
[02:24:01.255 --> 02:24:03.157]  None of these people are going to save us.
[02:24:03.157 --> 02:24:03.697]  Alright?
[02:24:03.697 --> 02:24:05.099]  They're committing blatant crimes.
[02:24:05.099 --> 02:24:05.940]  They're poisoning us.
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:08.102]  We don't have much time, everybody.
[02:24:08.102 --> 02:24:08.622]  Alright?
[02:24:08.622 --> 02:24:13.427]  Just the autism rate alone in 10 years... No, I was about to say, I got a whole stack of news on that.
[02:24:14.088 --> 02:24:23.795]  The first thing to do, Maddie, is never go to a big hospital, never go to a big globalist system, only go to local doctors that, more and more of them are patriots that we can trust.
[02:24:23.795 --> 02:24:26.657]  The doctors aren't bad, it's the overall system that's taking over.
[02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:27.477]  Exactly.
[02:24:27.477 --> 02:24:34.162]  Our choice is, we have to, anytime we can, not support the big corporations, because they are literally at war with us.
[02:24:35.555 --> 02:24:37.335]  We gotta stop bowing down, brother.
[02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:39.956]  We can't just run and hide into a hole and read a book.
[02:24:39.956 --> 02:24:41.256]  We gotta come together.
[02:24:41.256 --> 02:24:43.797]  The people have to come together and press these plates.
[02:24:43.797 --> 02:24:46.738]  We have to formal charges against these people.
[02:24:46.738 --> 02:24:48.718]  It's a criminal of global model.
[02:24:48.718 --> 02:24:49.558]  Amen, brother.
[02:24:49.558 --> 02:24:50.659]  Keep spreading the word, Matty.
[02:24:50.659 --> 02:24:51.499]  We love you.
[02:24:51.499 --> 02:24:52.979]  LJ in Virginia.
[02:24:52.979 --> 02:24:55.000]  LJ.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.880]  Yes, Alex.
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:57.540]  Good afternoon.
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:25:01.341]  Welcome.
[02:25:01.341 --> 02:25:04.302]  About 30 years ago, I was convicted of arson.
[02:25:05.239 --> 02:25:08.460]  So I know a little bit about the crime.
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:11.640]  I believe they're using road flares.
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:14.841]  It's more than just the gas.
[02:25:14.841 --> 02:25:20.482]  And with 70 mile an hour winds, it's not going to burn like in a straight line.
[02:25:20.482 --> 02:25:22.842]  It's going to jump.
[02:25:22.842 --> 02:25:33.404]  The pictures that I've seen on the Internet and different things, even on Infowars, the cars are charred.
[02:25:34.122 --> 02:25:42.826]  I think what happened, most of the places over in, you know, around Hawaii, they're probably using gas.
[02:25:42.826 --> 02:25:43.966]  Like, natural gas.
[02:25:43.966 --> 02:25:46.628]  No, they admit there was a lot of explosions.
[02:25:46.628 --> 02:25:48.949]  A lot of the gas blew up.
[02:25:48.949 --> 02:25:49.389]  Right.
[02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:53.271]  Well, the lines are plastic.
[02:25:53.271 --> 02:25:59.053]  Because I took a job one time for the gas company.
[02:25:59.053 --> 02:26:00.734]  So, they're plastic.
[02:26:00.734 --> 02:26:02.675]  And what happened, those crimps,
[02:26:03.607 --> 02:26:13.454]  Lost its tightness and caused a gas leak, and that's why people were turned to dust.
[02:26:13.454 --> 02:26:18.598]  Certain things were turned to dust.
[02:26:18.598 --> 02:26:19.058]  Exactly.
[02:26:19.058 --> 02:26:20.719]  You don't need lasers for that.
[02:26:20.719 --> 02:26:30.606]  You set fires in 70 mile an hour winds, and like you said, it'll jump roads, the flame will go like a stream and just burn everything, and then it melts the pipes and they blow up.
[02:26:30.606 --> 02:26:32.968]  Yes, and I believe
[02:26:34.028 --> 02:26:56.413]  Truthfully, the only way you're going to get a large quantity of road flares is from a, like a fire department, a forestry department, police, or either it's just like you said, like Antifa or BLM, but they are being funded.
[02:26:57.586 --> 02:26:59.388]  I don't think they use lasers.
[02:26:59.388 --> 02:27:01.410]  I think they use something like road flares.
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:18.463]  They burn between 1,000 and 1,500 degrees.
[02:27:18.463 --> 02:27:24.408]  And for folks that don't know, a blacksmith can melt steel with a bellows injecting air into coals.
[02:27:24.408 --> 02:27:25.569]  So that's what wind does.
[02:27:25.569 --> 02:27:28.451]  And a bellows is like 30 miles an hour.
[02:27:28.451 --> 02:27:30.132]  Exactly.
[02:27:30.132 --> 02:27:34.256]  And I gave my heart and soul to Christ.
[02:27:34.256 --> 02:27:44.564]  I'm not a globalist by no means, but I think what's happened is they have to keep this narrative going.
[02:27:45.302 --> 02:27:56.249]  Every time something comes out about Hunter Biden or anybody else, you might say they go in and they cause something to happen.
[02:27:56.249 --> 02:27:57.349]  Look at Canada.
[02:27:57.349 --> 02:28:02.192]  Hundreds of fires on satellites started the same 30 minutes.
[02:28:02.192 --> 02:28:04.193]  That was road flares.
[02:28:04.193 --> 02:28:04.794]  Exactly.
[02:28:04.794 --> 02:28:06.215]  That's not lightning.
[02:28:06.215 --> 02:28:11.098]  That's not when 100 plus fires start in one province at the same time.
[02:28:11.098 --> 02:28:13.139]  That's deliberate.
[02:28:13.139 --> 02:28:13.999]  That's yes.
[02:28:15.347 --> 02:28:17.309]  That's delivered.
[02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:28.879]  I mean, with my case, what I was convicted of, it was 35 mile an hour winds, and it was a house.
[02:28:28.879 --> 02:28:37.026]  And it wound up burning the grass, but you couldn't tell with road flares, that's what we used.
[02:28:37.026 --> 02:28:38.127]  Yeah, because you're right.
[02:28:38.127 --> 02:28:40.869]  Fire investigators find gasoline, road flares disappear, right?
[02:28:42.006 --> 02:28:45.011]  Exactly, especially when you put water to it.
[02:28:45.011 --> 02:28:51.101]  Look at like, uh, look at the, um, you know, like... Hold on, we're gonna get your name and number.
[02:28:51.101 --> 02:28:52.483]  I want you on as a guest.
[02:28:52.483 --> 02:28:53.124]  Get his name and number.
[02:28:53.124 --> 02:28:54.266]  I want to hear about this.
[02:28:54.266 --> 02:28:54.867]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:54.867 --> 02:28:55.247]  Stay with us.
[02:28:58.263 --> 02:29:06.426]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[02:29:06.426 --> 02:29:11.909]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[02:29:11.909 --> 02:29:16.850]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:29:18.231 --> 02:29:23.075]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[02:30:08.501 --> 02:30:09.302]  Hey, what's better?
[02:30:09.302 --> 02:30:10.163]  Knockout?
[02:30:10.163 --> 02:30:11.504]  What's better?
[02:30:11.504 --> 02:30:12.245]  Down-and-out?
[02:30:12.245 --> 02:30:12.786]  What's better?
[02:30:12.786 --> 02:30:15.048]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:30:15.048 --> 02:30:19.993]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:30:20.658 --> 02:30:24.622]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:30:24.622 --> 02:30:25.963]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:30:25.963 --> 02:30:27.264]  They're all very diverse.
[02:30:27.264 --> 02:30:37.453]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[02:30:57.240 --> 02:31:03.743]  When hope and love has been lost, and you fall to the ground, you must find a way.
[02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:12.812]  When the darkness descends, and you're told it's the end, you must find a way.
[02:31:12.812 --> 02:31:18.518]  When God decides to look the other way, and a clown takes the throne, we must find a way.
[02:31:18.518 --> 02:31:21.162]  You will find a way.
[02:31:21.162 --> 02:31:23.404]  Dig down and find faith.
[02:31:24.865 --> 02:31:32.007]  When you're close to the edge, with a gun to your head, you must find a way.
[02:31:32.007 --> 02:31:34.928]  We have entered the fray and we will not obey.
[02:31:34.928 --> 02:31:40.169]  We must find a way and find faith.
[02:31:40.169 --> 02:31:47.171]  We won't let them divide.
[02:31:47.171 --> 02:31:51.072]  We will never abide.
[02:31:51.072 --> 02:31:52.793]  We will find a way.
[02:31:52.793 --> 02:31:53.273]  Infowars.com
[02:31:58.226 --> 02:32:01.368]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:32:01.368 --> 02:32:03.670]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:07.613]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:32:07.613 --> 02:32:15.699]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:32:15.699 --> 02:32:24.325]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:28.233]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:32:28.233 --> 02:32:34.779]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:32:34.779 --> 02:32:37.822]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:32:37.822 --> 02:32:46.070]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:32:46.770 --> 02:32:51.054]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at m4store.com.
[02:32:51.054 --> 02:32:55.999]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:32:55.999 --> 02:32:58.842]  Please take action now.
[02:32:58.842 --> 02:33:04.728]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.293 --> 02:33:21.055]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.055 --> 02:33:27.278]  In 1984, Charlie Reese of the Orlando Sentinel wrote the following, still true today.
[02:33:38.039 --> 02:33:59.762]  100 Senators, 435 Congressmen, 1 President, and 9 Supreme Court Justices equates to 545 human beings out of 300 million who are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.
[02:34:00.442 --> 02:34:06.967]  I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by Congress.
[02:34:06.967 --> 02:34:16.834]  In 1913, Congress delegated its constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, central bank.
[02:34:17.734 --> 02:34:22.838]  I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason.
[02:34:22.838 --> 02:34:24.779]  They have no legal authority.
[02:34:24.779 --> 02:34:31.904]  They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one cotton-picking thing.
[02:34:31.904 --> 02:34:36.226]  I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million in cash.
[02:34:36.226 --> 02:34:40.449]  The politician has the power to accept or reject it.
[02:34:40.449 --> 02:34:46.854]  No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.
[02:34:47.754 --> 02:34:56.600]  Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault.
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:35:01.744]  They cooperate in this common con regardless of party.
[02:35:01.744 --> 02:35:03.625]  It seems inconceivable to me.
[02:35:04.125 --> 02:35:16.212]  That a nation of 300 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted by present facts of incompetence and irresponsibility.
[02:35:16.212 --> 02:35:22.135]  I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people.
[02:35:24.872 --> 02:35:36.320]  ...grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist.
[02:35:37.262 --> 02:35:41.183]  If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair.
[02:35:41.183 --> 02:35:45.263]  If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red.
[02:35:45.263 --> 02:35:52.725]  If the Army and Marines are in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's because they want them in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:35:52.725 --> 02:36:02.067]  If they do not receive Social Security, but are on an elite retirement plan, not available to the people, it's because they want it that way.
[02:36:02.067 --> 02:36:04.507]  There are no insoluble government problems.
[02:36:04.987 --> 02:36:14.339]  Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish.
[02:36:14.339 --> 02:36:18.404]  To lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject.
[02:36:18.404 --> 02:36:23.651]  To regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power.
[02:36:24.271 --> 02:36:38.364]  Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like the economy, inflation, or politics that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do.
[02:36:39.225 --> 02:36:44.447]  Those 545 people and they alone are responsible.
[02:36:44.447 --> 02:36:47.168]  They and they alone have the power.
[02:36:47.168 --> 02:36:53.151]  They and they alone should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses.
[02:36:53.151 --> 02:36:59.653]  Provided the voters have the gumption to manage their employees.
[02:36:59.653 --> 02:37:04.015]  Reading from Charlie Reese and reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:37:19.324 --> 02:37:26.571]  The name of the report at Bandot Video and Infowars.com is 545 versus 300 plus million.
[02:37:26.571 --> 02:37:27.451]  Very important report.
[02:37:27.451 --> 02:37:28.993]  Hope you share it if you want to win.
[02:37:28.993 --> 02:37:35.559]  All right, I'll host some of the next hour and talk to Zachary, Amber, Randy, and that'll be it for the calls.
[02:37:35.559 --> 02:37:37.661]  But I wanted to bring a very special guest on because
[02:37:40.111 --> 02:37:42.512]  Everything we promote, I know, is the answer.
[02:37:42.512 --> 02:37:44.352]  And I think we've proven that we're over the target.
[02:37:44.352 --> 02:37:45.272]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:37:45.272 --> 02:37:50.834]  The globalists want to control us via cutting off our energy and cutting off our food.
[02:37:50.834 --> 02:37:53.994]  They're cutting off energy for vehicles and infrastructure and machines.
[02:37:53.994 --> 02:37:55.615]  They're cutting off food to us.
[02:37:55.615 --> 02:37:58.735]  They're totally starving the third world to death and flooding us right now.
[02:37:58.735 --> 02:38:00.716]  Massive food riots worldwide.
[02:38:00.716 --> 02:38:01.676]  Massive starvation.
[02:38:01.676 --> 02:38:03.857]  But they don't... It's the back of the newspaper.
[02:38:03.857 --> 02:38:06.717]  Hundreds of millions on the edge of starvation.
[02:38:06.717 --> 02:38:08.818]  60, 70 million extra starved to death the last three years.
[02:38:09.338 --> 02:38:11.419]  Those are real people.
[02:38:11.419 --> 02:38:14.862]  And so I want everybody to listen to me and understand this is a win-win.
[02:38:14.862 --> 02:38:20.025]  You need water filtration, you need air filtration, water more important than air, and you need storable foods.
[02:38:20.025 --> 02:38:30.252]  Now my Patriot Supply and Ready Hour has only been around 16 years, and within four or five years they became the biggest storable food company in the country because they give you high quality food at a low price.
[02:38:30.252 --> 02:38:36.857]  So yes, I'm about to pitch you high quality storable food, ready to ship, air filtration and water filtration, 10% off.
[02:38:36.857 --> 02:38:37.978]  We were supposed to end it this week.
[02:38:38.638 --> 02:38:43.701]  This weekend, they gave us one more week or until Saturday or so.
[02:38:43.701 --> 02:38:47.704]  And then it will go back to regular price, which is already the lowest price out there going to find.
[02:38:47.704 --> 02:38:48.805]  We take 10% off.
[02:38:48.805 --> 02:38:50.486]  We're making like 30% on this.
[02:38:50.486 --> 02:38:52.647]  Other people are making like 100%, 200%.
[02:38:52.647 --> 02:38:53.288]  We don't do that.
[02:38:53.288 --> 02:38:55.709]  10% off is massive.
[02:38:55.709 --> 02:38:57.371]  We need to fund ourselves.
[02:38:57.371 --> 02:38:59.212]  But these are great products you need.
[02:38:59.212 --> 02:39:03.655]  This is the place to get water filtration, air filtration, storable foods.
[02:39:03.655 --> 02:39:07.978]  So I called them last week and I said, they're already saying, hey, you got to stop, you know,
[02:39:08.778 --> 02:39:10.098]  We only ship stuff we got in store.
[02:39:10.098 --> 02:39:11.879]  We're going to run out of water filters soon.
[02:39:11.879 --> 02:39:15.439]  We got plenty of food, but some of the stuff, some of the special items are getting low.
[02:39:15.439 --> 02:39:16.740]  We'll come back with a sale in a few months."
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:19.460]  And I said, no, I want another four or five, six days.
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:20.921]  They said, okay.
[02:39:20.921 --> 02:39:25.081]  So we got Joe Recon and I've been to their main facility in Utah.
[02:39:25.081 --> 02:39:27.322]  They've got facilities all over the U.S.
[02:39:27.322 --> 02:39:28.702]  and it's a giant.
[02:39:28.702 --> 02:39:29.662]  You think Walmart's big.
[02:39:29.662 --> 02:39:30.863]  It's like 10 times the size.
[02:39:30.863 --> 02:39:31.443]  You can park a
[02:39:33.055 --> 02:39:36.097]  Mythical Star Destroyer inside there.
[02:39:36.097 --> 02:39:41.219]  And they are there with this food, with Americans packing and shipping, and incredible packaging.
[02:39:41.219 --> 02:39:43.540]  It'll last 25 years.
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:46.322]  Joe Reek joins us for the Balance of the Hour.
[02:39:46.322 --> 02:39:48.023]  Then I'll come back and take calls.
[02:39:48.023 --> 02:39:56.747]  Expert in managing strategic partner alliances, building valuable relationships with key clients, training and leading successful sales teams, and growing startup businesses.
[02:39:56.747 --> 02:40:02.210]  Results-driven, senior-level professional with over 14 years of experience exceeding customer expectations and goals.
[02:40:03.269 --> 02:40:11.976]  Sets the precedent in performance by developing and implementing highly effective sales strategies, partnering, retention strategies, and relationships.
[02:40:11.976 --> 02:40:26.088]  PrepareWithAlex.com takes you right to the subpage of InfoWarsTore.com to get the lowest prices anywhere on air filtration, water filtration, high-quality, affordable food that's in stock, ready to ship that last 25 years.
[02:40:26.088 --> 02:40:26.748]  So, Joe Reek.
[02:40:27.651 --> 02:40:32.496]  I've kind of laid out the food shortages, the food riots, the food facilities getting blown up.
[02:40:32.496 --> 02:40:33.858]  Yeah, it funds our operation.
[02:40:33.858 --> 02:40:34.879]  That's important.
[02:40:34.879 --> 02:40:38.202]  But more importantly, this is something everybody needs.
[02:40:38.202 --> 02:40:40.024]  They need to get involved now.
[02:40:40.024 --> 02:40:46.992]  So I'm going to try to give you the floor for the next 20 minutes or so to lay this out and tell people about this massive sale that's about to end.
[02:40:46.992 --> 02:40:48.153]  Thanks for joining us, Joe.
[02:40:49.306 --> 02:40:51.168]  Hey, Alex, it's a pleasure to be on here with you.
[02:40:51.168 --> 02:40:52.730]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[02:40:52.730 --> 02:40:57.155]  And like you said, yes, now is the time for people to get prepared.
[02:40:57.155 --> 02:41:08.289]  You know, preparedness is not just a one party affiliation, but preparedness involves everybody, regardless of what your religious backgrounds are, regardless of what your political affiliations are as well.
[02:41:08.929 --> 02:41:14.051]  Everybody has a right to live, and everybody has a need to get better prepared.
[02:41:14.051 --> 02:41:30.456]  And here at MyPatriotSupply, we've partnered with the InfoWars store to provide you with the best long-term emergency food available today, as well as the best rates in which you can get it, the best variety of different meals, the highest caloric intake, and the best ease of preparation.
[02:41:30.996 --> 02:41:32.817]  You got to take advantage of it now.
[02:41:32.817 --> 02:41:38.860]  And Alex, I love what you say and what you tell people is to get yourself, you know, into the information and learn about this for yourself.
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:40.581]  Because guess what, Alex?
[02:41:40.581 --> 02:41:43.382]  Nobody's going to care more about your success.
[02:41:43.382 --> 02:41:46.264]  Nobody's going to care more about your life than yourself.
[02:41:46.864 --> 02:41:54.949]  And if you sit around thinking that the government is going to come bail you out of any type of emergency or natural disaster that is happening, you're wrong.
[02:41:54.949 --> 02:41:58.451]  Look what they did during the 2020, you know, pandemic of COVID.
[02:41:58.451 --> 02:42:02.813]  Look what's going on right now in a beautiful city of Lahaina and Maui.
[02:42:02.813 --> 02:42:05.035]  Those people, they're left stranded.
[02:42:05.035 --> 02:42:07.036]  They need help and they need it now.
[02:42:07.036 --> 02:42:12.439]  And if they're waiting for the government to come bail them out, they're going to be waiting for a very, very long time.
[02:42:13.019 --> 02:42:22.062]  It is our responsibility, our need to be self-sufficient and self-reliant to do the work yourself to get prepared because nobody's going to do it for you.
[02:42:22.062 --> 02:42:27.364]  Alex, now is the time to get prepared because you and I both know what is coming down the pipeline.
[02:42:27.364 --> 02:42:33.347]  We have threats from all over the world and these are things that are not talked about in the mainstream media.
[02:42:33.347 --> 02:42:36.748]  These are reports that are buried upon pages and pages of news.
[02:42:37.128 --> 02:42:39.509]  That people don't understand what is going on.
[02:42:39.509 --> 02:42:49.613]  You know, the threat that we have from China, the wars that are going over there in the Ukraine, the impact that it has on our global food supply.
[02:42:49.613 --> 02:42:52.495]  It's gonna hit here in the United States and it's gonna hit fast.
[02:42:52.495 --> 02:43:02.299]  So now is the time to get prepared and get what you need to get for you and your family so you can have the peace of mind that if anything were to happen, you can take care of you and your family, Alex.
[02:43:04.175 --> 02:43:08.136]  Well, I mean, it's a no-brainer to say people should get ready now.
[02:43:08.136 --> 02:43:10.136]  We're going into a global crisis.
[02:43:10.136 --> 02:43:13.057]  Yeah, I want to fund our operations here on air, but I've got tons of storable food.
[02:43:13.057 --> 02:43:14.297]  I've got water filters.
[02:43:14.297 --> 02:43:15.397]  I've got solar panels.
[02:43:15.397 --> 02:43:18.478]  I've got everything because I don't want to be dependent on people.
[02:43:18.478 --> 02:43:20.559]  This is the most important investment people can make.
[02:43:20.559 --> 02:43:27.760]  And with inflation, as I've said the last three years, people have bought storable food from you three, four years ago that's sitting there that's going to be good for a couple more decades.
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:31.281]  If food prices have basically doubled worldwide, that investment already paid off.
[02:43:32.851 --> 02:43:33.212]  100%.
[02:43:33.212 --> 02:43:40.283]  There's no other place where you can put your money and have it, you know, increase the way that the economy is going right now.
[02:43:40.283 --> 02:43:48.275]  Long-term emergency food is one of the best places that you can have your money parked to get the value increase with it because commodities increase over time.
[02:43:48.755 --> 02:43:55.077]  You know, we've had tremendous price increases on the basic staples, flour, wheat, corn.
[02:43:55.077 --> 02:43:59.578]  We've seen double-digit increases over the span of a very few years.
[02:43:59.578 --> 02:44:00.438]  And guess what?
[02:44:00.438 --> 02:44:03.459]  Those prices are still going to be inflating.
[02:44:03.459 --> 02:44:06.020]  They're going to keep going up and up.
[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:15.022]  As time goes on, as different countries are putting different bans on exporting their raw materials, their goods, it's going to have the effect here in the United States on the bottom dollar.
[02:44:15.562 --> 02:44:15.763]  I'm good.
[02:44:32.941 --> 02:44:36.966]  You know, we talk a lot about emergencies and disasters, but guess what, Alex?
[02:44:36.966 --> 02:44:39.308]  It doesn't have to be a global pandemic.
[02:44:39.308 --> 02:44:44.014]  It doesn't have to be a hurricane or an earthquake to make people want to get prepared.
[02:44:44.014 --> 02:44:46.496]  Oh, they're already trying to start more race riots right now.
[02:44:46.496 --> 02:44:47.618]  This is such a no-brainer.
[02:44:48.892 --> 02:44:50.994]  It could be as simple as a job loss.
[02:44:50.994 --> 02:44:54.716]  Now, does that not qualify for an emergency for that particular family?
[02:44:54.716 --> 02:44:55.937]  Absolutely it does.
[02:44:55.937 --> 02:44:59.059]  And that's why we try to educate people is to get prepared.
[02:44:59.059 --> 02:45:01.601]  If you don't know where to start, let us help you out.
[02:45:01.601 --> 02:45:04.723]  We can put together a plan that works best for you and your family.
[02:45:04.723 --> 02:45:10.847]  But the idea, Alex, and I want all of your viewers to know this, is you've got to get started now.
[02:45:10.847 --> 02:45:11.508]  Get started.
[02:45:11.508 --> 02:45:12.448]  Keep it simple.
[02:45:12.448 --> 02:45:16.991]  If you don't know where to go, start off with a four-week supply and build up to a year's supply.
[02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:17.852]  Let's talk about that.
[02:45:18.012 --> 02:45:31.036]  Because if I went to Walmart to buy the plastic sealed containers that you sell, the big ones, the small ones, it costs more than what you would get with food inside other sealed containers.
[02:45:31.036 --> 02:45:36.178]  That portability, the packaging itself, not just the food's great, is very important.
[02:45:36.178 --> 02:45:40.800]  Because a lot of the packaging is flimsy, it's old, I don't want to attack the industry, but there's a lot of crap.
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:43.381]  You guys are number one because you've got the best quality.
[02:45:43.381 --> 02:45:47.482]  Tell people about the packaging and then about the food itself and about some of the different deals you've got.
[02:45:48.891 --> 02:45:51.392]  Well, you know, the packaging is really what's going to set us apart.
[02:45:51.392 --> 02:45:54.693]  You know, we package our stuff in these metal Mylar pouches.
[02:45:54.693 --> 02:46:09.979]  These are durable, they're tear-proof, they have a built-in Ziploc inside of here, so if you're not going to be using the full contents of this pouch, you can easily store it with a Ziploc insider, save it, use it within the next 7 to 10 days, and you'll still have the long-term emergency food available for you.
[02:46:10.519 --> 02:46:16.363]  We go a step further to protect these pouches by putting them inside of these durable plastic containers.
[02:46:16.363 --> 02:46:25.488]  So if you are in the need of evacuation, you have to get up and go very quickly, you simply grab the bucket that has a variety of meals already inside of it and you're out the door.
[02:46:26.121 --> 02:46:28.883]  You don't have to worry about picking the meals that you want to have.
[02:46:28.883 --> 02:46:39.169]  You won't have to worry about getting the right amount of calories because all of our packages, Alex, all of our meal plans have up to 2,000 calories per day per person.
[02:46:39.169 --> 02:46:44.252]  You're also going to be getting up to 30 to 40 grams of protein per day as well.
[02:46:44.252 --> 02:46:49.695]  And again, the meal variety, the meal selection, you're not going to find another company here in the United States that's going to provide you.
[02:46:49.695 --> 02:46:52.177]  Listen, we had the power off for two weeks a couple years ago.
[02:46:53.277 --> 02:46:54.399]  I've bought all this trouble food.
[02:46:54.399 --> 02:46:55.300]  It tastes great.
[02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:57.303]  It's nutritious.
[02:46:57.303 --> 02:46:58.525]  It's healthy.
[02:46:58.525 --> 02:46:59.106]  It's good.
[02:46:59.106 --> 02:47:02.071]  I mean, people need this.
[02:47:02.071 --> 02:47:03.113]  You guys are the best.
[02:47:04.324 --> 02:47:05.025]  We are, you know.
[02:47:05.025 --> 02:47:09.750]  These are calories and nutrition that's derived from complex carbohydrates.
[02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:12.012]  So it's not going to have the fillers in there.
[02:47:12.012 --> 02:47:17.178]  You're not going to be left wanting, you're not going to be left needing more food after you consume one of our meals.
[02:47:17.178 --> 02:47:19.300]  And everybody always asks... Well, talk about some of your best sellers.
[02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:21.502]  You've got beef, you've got chicken, you've got everything.
[02:47:21.502 --> 02:47:22.884]  You've got special meals.
[02:47:22.884 --> 02:47:23.685]  Go through your products.
[02:47:24.818 --> 02:47:29.200]  So anything that you can think about, you know, we are a long-term emergency food company.
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:41.206]  We have meals, for example, like cheesy broccoli soup, chili macaroni, spaghetti, Southwest rice, mushroom rice pilaf, honey wheat bread, lasagna, spaghetti.
[02:47:41.206 --> 02:47:47.229]  We have 21 different meal varieties that you can get inside of a three-month emergency supply package.
[02:47:47.229 --> 02:47:52.152]  We offer freeze-dried fruits, freeze-dried vegetables, as well as freeze-dried meats.
[02:47:52.958 --> 02:47:59.622]  But besides the food, Alex, people need to understand as well that we also carry the best survival gear in the country.
[02:47:59.622 --> 02:48:08.867]  We have solar power banks, so the people that are stuck in Lahaina and Maui without any power, they can use these power banks to charge their cell phones so they can get critical news updates.
[02:48:09.287 --> 02:48:16.833]  We have water purification systems that are on sale right now at TheInfoWarStore.com where you can have clean water.
[02:48:16.833 --> 02:48:33.886]  If you're worried about the water in your neighborhoods, the water in your community, you know, that gets down through simple irrigation, now you can rest assured that you can get rid of all the bacteria, all of the harmful gross chemicals inside of your water by filtering it through the Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system.
[02:48:34.406 --> 02:48:40.132]  You've got to have a reliable source for water and you've got to have a reliable source for food.
[02:48:40.132 --> 02:48:46.619]  MyPatriotSupply, preparewithalex.com is your source to get that information and to get those products.
[02:48:46.619 --> 02:48:49.322]  But again, these things run out.
[02:48:49.322 --> 02:48:53.967]  We have an infinite-sized warehouse that always has food coming in.
[02:48:53.967 --> 02:48:56.029]  Well let's be clear, about two years ago...
[02:48:57.577 --> 02:49:03.921]  For a while, you guys said put it on pause because you were almost out of food, out of water filters, out of a lot of stuff.
[02:49:03.921 --> 02:49:07.183]  And but other groups were still taking orders when they didn't have it either.
[02:49:07.183 --> 02:49:09.424]  So they were lying.
[02:49:09.424 --> 02:49:12.406]  Yeah, you know, we've we learned some valuable lessons during COVID.
[02:49:12.406 --> 02:49:17.809]  And I'll be honest with you, Alex, there's no other company that could have survived COVID better than My Patriot Supply.
[02:49:17.809 --> 02:49:19.310]  And we learned a lot of things from that.
[02:49:19.310 --> 02:49:23.852]  And there's one thing moving forward from that, that we will never, ever do.
[02:49:23.852 --> 02:49:25.193]  And that's not be prepared.
[02:49:26.175 --> 02:49:28.801]  Our company is the leader in emergency preparedness.
[02:49:28.801 --> 02:49:29.081]  That's right.
[02:49:29.081 --> 02:49:31.346]  You guys were already geared up and you geared up even more.
[02:49:31.346 --> 02:49:36.637]  Like you guys had tripled in size sensing this was going to happen and it still wasn't enough for a while.
[02:49:37.711 --> 02:49:38.311]  Absolutely.
[02:49:38.311 --> 02:49:49.315]  Even right now, there's no other place where you can get your order during pandemics, during chaos, and have the reliability that you're going to get with MyPatriotSupply.com or PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:49:49.315 --> 02:49:54.536]  We are preparedness specialists, and we will always be prepared as long as we have control over it.
[02:49:54.536 --> 02:49:59.758]  And I know folks want to give us support with a sponsorship, so they go to MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:49:59.758 --> 02:50:03.699]  Do they enter a promo code, or do they just want to give us support, keep us on air?
[02:50:03.699 --> 02:50:05.060]  How do we make sure support goes to M4s?
[02:50:06.508 --> 02:50:17.218]  Yeah, you want to go to preparewithalex.com as well as go to the infowarsstore.com where you can take advantage of that 10% discount that we've extended to your viewers and your listeners for the next little bit, Alex.
[02:50:17.218 --> 02:50:25.585]  So I urge everybody to go there to get that valuable tools, the resources that you need to have that peace of mind to get better prepared.
[02:50:25.725 --> 02:50:35.451]  We have the lowest prices ready to ship products now, but if they go to preparewithalex.com or importwarsore.com, preparewithalex.com, which takes you to the sub-page where all the stuff's at, then you get that additional 10% off.
[02:50:35.451 --> 02:50:42.316]  And I know I twisted your arm, because you guys are saying you've still got a lot of the food, but the water filters are running low, people need to order now.
[02:50:42.316 --> 02:50:48.580]  I know you can at Inside Baseball and some of your other clients, but I know I've talked to you guys behind the scenes.
[02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:53.283]  A lot of agencies, a lot of governments, a lot of foundations are hoarding food right now.
[02:50:53.283 --> 02:50:54.364]  They know something big's coming.
[02:50:55.863 --> 02:50:57.464]  They are, as a matter of fact.
[02:50:57.464 --> 02:51:02.047]  And, you know, one thing that we pride ourselves on is we're always taking care of our customers.
[02:51:02.047 --> 02:51:05.248]  Our customers will come first every single time.
[02:51:05.248 --> 02:51:09.991]  People that call us in and order directly from us, they get the precedence, they get the priority.
[02:51:09.991 --> 02:51:12.112]  Not the government contracts, nothing like that.
[02:51:12.112 --> 02:51:16.374]  In fact, we're proud to say that we do very, very little with the federal government.
[02:51:16.374 --> 02:51:17.595]  In fact, if anything at all.
[02:51:17.595 --> 02:51:19.236]  But what are you hearing from the industry?
[02:51:19.236 --> 02:51:21.197]  Because I know the system's hoarding food.
[02:51:22.608 --> 02:51:27.852]  Well, there's going to be a major food supply shortage coming on right now.
[02:51:27.852 --> 02:51:33.796]  You know, with what's going on in the news, with what's going on in the world as well, Alex, you and I both know that food is going to be running out.
[02:51:33.796 --> 02:51:35.318]  By the way, we're not just saying that.
[02:51:35.318 --> 02:51:36.699]  The UN admits it.
[02:51:36.699 --> 02:51:38.520]  They've cut off 25% of the nitrogen.
[02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:39.561]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:51:39.561 --> 02:51:47.126]  Because Klaus Schwab knows you cut the food off, it creates an angrier world, which they want to use for their New World Order.
[02:51:47.126 --> 02:51:48.667]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[02:51:48.667 --> 02:51:50.129]  Here's the key.
[02:51:50.129 --> 02:51:51.890]  If you can control the food supply,
[02:51:52.671 --> 02:51:55.073]  You can control the people.
[02:51:55.073 --> 02:52:01.158]  The people that are pulling the strings right now to limit the production of food in the United States is a real threat.
[02:52:01.158 --> 02:52:02.720]  It is happening right now.
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:08.685]  The production of nitrogen for fertilizer, the shortages that are in that particular market in that area are real.
[02:52:09.443 --> 02:52:15.628]  There are bans on exporting wheat out of the Ukraine, which accounts for about 33% of our grain.
[02:52:15.628 --> 02:52:16.388]  Rice!
[02:52:16.388 --> 02:52:18.089]  Rice out of India and China.
[02:52:18.089 --> 02:52:26.035]  India just announced as well, they're banning all exports on their rice, which is going to affect millions and millions of people across Asia and Europe.
[02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:27.697]  Well, how much has rice already gone up?
[02:52:27.697 --> 02:52:32.020]  But you guys already bought your rice, so you're not passing on the increase.
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:32.520]  That's correct.
[02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:34.462]  Yeah, we forecast heavily.
[02:52:34.462 --> 02:52:38.865]  And we, like I said, you've been through our facility here in Salt Lake City, and it's nothing short of impressive.
[02:52:39.566 --> 02:52:48.614]  And you know, we do a tremendous job of securing the lowest rates, the best quality food here within the United States to put into our long-term emergency meals.
[02:52:48.614 --> 02:52:57.461]  We do have separate warehouses across the country that are also stocked full of these raw ingredients, of the ready-made meals, ready to go at a moment's notice.
[02:52:57.461 --> 02:53:05.008]  So yes, we do take preparedness very, very seriously, but there will come a time that that food will run out, Alex.
[02:53:05.008 --> 02:53:07.630]  And I don't say that to scare people, but that's just a simple fact.
[02:53:08.157 --> 02:53:23.342]  The way that the world is going right now with the threats, especially from China, infecting our power grids, controlling our networks, controlling the software that runs the water supplies that feed into military bases, that affect everywhere.
[02:53:23.342 --> 02:53:24.223]  It's happening.
[02:53:24.223 --> 02:53:26.083]  These are ticking time bombs.
[02:53:26.083 --> 02:53:36.347]  And all that says to me, and all that says to us, is something's going to be happening, and it's going to be happening a lot quicker, and it's going to take a lot of people by surprise if they don't get prepared and they don't heed these warnings, Alex.
[02:53:37.202 --> 02:53:39.224]  Well, I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[02:53:39.224 --> 02:53:40.865]  It's super simple.
[02:53:40.865 --> 02:53:46.330]  The number one thing is water filtration and firearms to protect yourself and being right with God and having friends and family you can trust.
[02:53:46.330 --> 02:53:48.812]  But everybody needs durable food that lasts.
[02:53:48.812 --> 02:53:55.638]  Talk about the quality of the food because, again, you can pay three, four times more and get some gourmet food that I could say tastes better, is better.
[02:53:55.638 --> 02:53:59.721]  But for the food you get, for the price, no one can come close.
[02:53:59.721 --> 02:54:02.664]  That's why you guys have been with us for 16 years.
[02:54:02.664 --> 02:54:04.265]  It's why you're the top company out there.
[02:54:04.265 --> 02:54:05.306]  I mean, this is quality food.
[02:54:06.548 --> 02:54:16.930]  Absolutely, and I will venture to guess that if I were to put some of our ready-made meals onto a dinner table and not let people know that they're eating emergency food, they could not tell the difference.
[02:54:16.930 --> 02:54:24.952]  We have amazing people here at our facility, here in our team, that research, that develop these meals and make them the best possible way.
[02:54:24.952 --> 02:54:25.912]  And what does it come down to?
[02:54:25.912 --> 02:54:28.313]  Last time I checked, it was like a third the price of the grocery store.
[02:54:29.841 --> 02:54:31.082]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:54:31.082 --> 02:54:38.269]  For dollars a day, you can provide long-term emergency food for you and your family to get the calories that you're not going to be able to get anywhere else for the price.
[02:54:38.269 --> 02:54:43.914]  If you were to take a look at some of our meals, it would cost you dollars a day to support your family with.
[02:54:43.914 --> 02:54:45.556]  Very, very affordable.
[02:54:45.556 --> 02:54:50.080]  The biggest thing is, Alex, people aren't used to buying three months worth of groceries up front.
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:52.903]  So it might be a little bit of a sticker shock, but when you do the math on it,
[02:54:53.403 --> 02:54:54.624]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:54:54.624 --> 02:54:58.007]  It makes sense to have a little bit stored away into your home.
[02:54:58.007 --> 02:55:01.250]  If you can't do three months, heck, do a four-week supply.
[02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:04.393]  If you can't do four weeks, get a 72-hour kit.
[02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:07.495]  Get something, because something is better than nothing.
[02:55:07.495 --> 02:55:09.137]  And now is the time to do it.
[02:55:09.137 --> 02:55:10.378]  Take advantage of the lower prices.
[02:55:10.378 --> 02:55:10.738]  That's right.
[02:55:10.738 --> 02:55:15.102]  Get started, because we don't know whether the collapse is going to be next week or next year, and we're trying to stop it.
[02:55:15.102 --> 02:55:16.203]  We probably can't.
[02:55:16.203 --> 02:55:17.664]  World War III, all of it.
[02:55:17.664 --> 02:55:19.246]  Start buying a month's supply every month.
[02:55:19.246 --> 02:55:19.766]  Build it up.
[02:55:19.766 --> 02:55:20.206]  It lasts 25 years.
[02:55:22.297 --> 02:55:26.478]  Emergency preparedness, Alex, it's not a destination, but it is a journey.
[02:55:26.478 --> 02:55:28.878]  You know, a lot of families are struggling right now.
[02:55:28.878 --> 02:55:31.939]  They don't have any extra available income to spend on this.
[02:55:31.939 --> 02:55:38.120]  But I urge you, whatever you have left, whatever little it may be, if you don't think it's enough to make a difference, you're wrong.
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:38.580]  Get it.
[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:39.940]  Get started now.
[02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:44.021]  The more people are prepared, Alex, the better off everybody is going to be.
[02:55:44.021 --> 02:55:46.722]  And it's not based on political affiliation.
[02:55:46.722 --> 02:55:48.222]  Everybody needs to be prepared.
[02:55:48.302 --> 02:55:54.768]  Well you've got the lowest prices always compared to anybody out there for quality, but give me the numbers.
[02:55:54.768 --> 02:56:04.558]  Three years ago we were warning people, I know food prices have exploded, you've kept them down compared to others, but how much would people have saved now on average if they bought three years ago versus now?
[02:56:05.831 --> 02:56:07.811]  Hundreds of dollars.
[02:56:07.811 --> 02:56:13.972]  We try to keep our prices low because, again, we try to take care of our customers the best to our ability.
[02:56:13.972 --> 02:56:17.333]  However, we cannot control the rising price of corn.
[02:56:17.333 --> 02:56:22.554]  We cannot control the rising price of flour or wheat or anything else.
[02:56:22.554 --> 02:56:32.056]  What we can control is the quality that we put into our meals, the rate at which we get our products shipped out, and all those other factors that make to a great experience for our customers.
[02:56:32.056 --> 02:56:33.676]  But you've got to take advantage of it now.
[02:56:34.296 --> 02:56:39.839]  Take advantage of these lower prices because prices is one thing that is always going to be changing and always going up.
[02:56:39.839 --> 02:56:47.022]  Never once has there ever been a grocery store that raised their prices, but then a couple months later lowered their prices back down.
[02:56:47.022 --> 02:56:48.503]  It just does not work that way.
[02:56:48.503 --> 02:56:55.386]  They got to take advantage of these discounts, got to take advantage of the sales when we have them, because you don't know when the food is going to run out.
[02:56:55.386 --> 02:57:03.370]  But I urge everybody to get prepared while you can, when you can, because it's a lot better to get prepared before an emergency than afterwards.
[02:57:03.390 --> 02:57:05.732]  And the best deals are year supplies and more.
[02:57:05.732 --> 02:57:08.235]  You got to take care of your friends and family too, folks.
[02:57:08.235 --> 02:57:09.076]  Preparewithalex.com or 877-789-2539.

[02:57:19.787 --> 02:57:20.247]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:57:20.247 --> 02:57:21.527]  I'm teleprompter free.
[02:57:21.527 --> 02:57:22.128]  Sometimes I mess up.
[02:57:22.128 --> 02:57:23.048]  Prepare with Alex.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:23.048 --> 02:57:24.208]  Ready to ship.

[03:00:13.003 --> 03:00:16.827]  Well, storable food, water filtration, and the rest of it is how we fund the operation.
[03:00:16.827 --> 03:00:19.229]  It's a great company, and it's a win-win.

[03:00:24.093 --> 03:00:24.913]  InfoWars.com.
[03:00:24.913 --> 03:00:30.558]  All right, Zachary, Amber, and Randy, I'm going to get to you in the hand of the baton to the great Gerald Cilente.
[03:00:30.558 --> 03:00:32.720]  Coming up in one hour from now, Owen Schroer.
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:34.361]  Zachary in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[03:00:34.361 --> 03:00:35.983]  Go ahead.
[03:00:35.983 --> 03:00:38.985]  Hey, God bless you, Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:00:41.176 --> 03:00:59.207]  What they're doing to Donald Trump, what that does to us citizens of America is it's making me and a lot of my family and friends just upset because we feel helpless.
[03:00:59.207 --> 03:01:00.688]  It's a war being fought
[03:01:01.527 --> 03:01:02.387]  I mean, I'm not surprised.
[03:01:02.387 --> 03:01:04.688]  They're doing everything they can.
[03:01:04.688 --> 03:01:08.489]  We know they're panicking because good will always win over evil, but I just want to remind you and your listeners
[03:01:27.596 --> 03:01:37.160]  of what happened in August 1st and 2nd, 1946, McMinn County, Tennessee, Athens, Tennessee.
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:47.525]  It was called the Battle of Athens, and it was about how the local elections were, voters of the city were suspicious of
[03:01:49.227 --> 03:02:01.591]  Yeah, the end of World War II, they were still in the election, and the Patriots took over the town.
[03:02:01.591 --> 03:02:02.651]  That's right.
[03:02:02.651 --> 03:02:09.873]  And that's what they did on a national scale, and they used COVID as a blockade.
[03:02:09.873 --> 03:02:17.155]  I remember watching all over the country, people came out with their Second Amendment arms
[03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:18.431]  I don't
[03:02:40.734 --> 03:02:43.256]  They don't mess around when it comes to their elections.
[03:02:43.256 --> 03:02:44.817]  They do it by the book.
[03:02:44.817 --> 03:02:46.398]  You have to have a real ID.
[03:02:46.398 --> 03:02:48.059]  They put it in a paper ballot.
[03:02:48.059 --> 03:02:48.699]  It's sealed.
[03:02:48.699 --> 03:02:56.684]  So if there's ever any suspicious fraudulent shenanigans, they will go back to the paper.
[03:02:56.684 --> 03:03:01.087]  So Trump is right when he says that it is all about the election.
[03:03:01.087 --> 03:03:04.769]  And they try to throw so many distractions on us.
[03:03:05.598 --> 03:03:11.444]  Uh, to keep us from thinking about how important our elections are.
[03:03:11.444 --> 03:03:14.787]  Now we have tons of immigrants coming over.
[03:03:14.787 --> 03:03:21.093]  Another scary thing is the immigrants now are allowed to be police officers in Illinois.
[03:03:21.093 --> 03:03:22.434]  I mean, did you see about that one?
[03:03:23.399 --> 03:03:26.240]  It's all part of the State Department Random 7277.
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:30.062]  They're going to march in UN troops in helmets.
[03:03:30.062 --> 03:03:34.804]  They just do it covertly, training us that being a citizen means nothing.
[03:03:34.804 --> 03:03:36.865]  The government brings in outside groups they control.
[03:03:36.865 --> 03:03:38.966]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:03:38.966 --> 03:03:40.226]  All right, I'm going to go to break.
[03:03:40.226 --> 03:03:43.247]  I'm going to come back very quickly and go to Amber and Randy.
[03:03:43.247 --> 03:03:44.628]  Randy and Amber.
[03:03:44.628 --> 03:03:49.370]  And then Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, is about to take over.
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:53.866]  But man, we're in the middle of a revolution.
[03:03:53.866 --> 03:03:56.932]  We're in the middle of a globalist black rock, State Street.
[03:03:57.802 --> 03:04:09.725]  Vanguard takeover and the good news is all these leaders, senators and presidents of Italy and just everybody talking about it and being aware of it and the fact that this is happening, BlackRock's having to back off some.
[03:04:09.725 --> 03:04:25.070]  Well, let's keep pressing and realize BlackRock controls in Azure Bush and Apple and Target and all these groups that are kamikazing our culture and just realize we're being hit by everything they've got right now.
[03:04:26.735 --> 03:04:30.457]  We're in the middle of a war.
[03:04:30.457 --> 03:04:31.478]  Randy, stay there.
[03:04:31.478 --> 03:04:32.579]  Back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:32.579 --> 03:04:33.059]  And then Amber.
[03:04:33.059 --> 03:04:36.201]  And then I hand the baton to the great.
[03:04:36.201 --> 03:04:40.964]  Trends forecaster Gerald Cilente from Kingston, New York.
[03:04:40.964 --> 03:04:42.065]  We live to see it.
[03:04:42.065 --> 03:04:43.666]  The beta test is over.
[03:04:43.666 --> 03:04:47.428]  We're inside the global corporate fascist New World Order.
[03:04:47.428 --> 03:04:50.270]  But humanity is rising.
[03:04:50.270 --> 03:04:52.011]  Everything's out in the open now.
[03:04:52.011 --> 03:04:53.072]  The gloves are off.
[03:04:53.072 --> 03:04:54.293]  The mask is down.
[03:04:57.469 --> 03:05:07.081]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[03:05:07.081 --> 03:05:12.388]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:05:12.828 --> 03:05:14.509]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:05:14.509 --> 03:05:17.470]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:05:17.470 --> 03:05:19.111]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:05:19.111 --> 03:05:24.033]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:05:24.033 --> 03:05:25.773]  This is something you need now.
[03:05:25.773 --> 03:05:30.335]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[03:05:30.335 --> 03:05:36.057]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:05:36.057 --> 03:05:42.220]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water.
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:43.961]  And air filtration.
[03:05:43.961 --> 03:05:46.644]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:05:46.644 --> 03:05:47.945]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[03:05:47.945 --> 03:05:50.827]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:05:50.827 --> 03:06:03.258]  Go to nfowarstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:06:03.258 --> 03:06:08.202]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.473 --> 03:06:19.983]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[03:06:19.983 --> 03:06:30.277]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[03:06:31.085 --> 03:06:37.691]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:06:37.691 --> 03:06:42.455]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[03:06:42.455 --> 03:06:49.481]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[03:07:07.694 --> 03:07:12.157]  Alright, we're skipping this next network break, so Gerald Slyndyk gets his time back.
[03:07:12.157 --> 03:07:14.199]  Probably gone here in about four minutes.
[03:07:14.199 --> 03:07:16.701]  Let's talk to Randy in Seattle, then Amber in Utah.
[03:07:16.701 --> 03:07:17.541]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:07:17.541 --> 03:07:20.904]  Hello Alex, how you doing?
[03:07:20.904 --> 03:07:21.985]  In the fight now, brother!
[03:07:21.985 --> 03:07:26.448]  Hey, I just wanted to say hi, and we're praying for you.
[03:07:26.448 --> 03:07:34.414]  And I used to doubt what you said, and I did the research online and through books, and you're right.
[03:07:34.414 --> 03:07:35.855]  It's scary what times we're in.
[03:07:36.718 --> 03:07:41.922]  And, um, I met you years ago, right before the WTO riots in Seattle.
[03:07:41.922 --> 03:07:44.784]  I came down to see you.
[03:07:44.784 --> 03:07:46.645]  I'm one of the guys that tripped.
[03:07:46.645 --> 03:07:54.331]  You're in an argument with somebody that's laughing at you, and I tripped, and you guys helped me up, and I wanted to talk to you then, but it's been 20 years.
[03:07:54.331 --> 03:08:03.398]  Just, um, if people get their house in order, they quit lying, cheating, and stealing, maybe the world would be a better place, and, um,
[03:08:04.201 --> 03:08:10.443]  All the change is going to start locally at your local government level with voting.
[03:08:10.443 --> 03:08:15.064]  For your school boards, your local politicians, research them.
[03:08:15.064 --> 03:08:19.185]  Find out who they are and what they stand for.
[03:08:19.185 --> 03:08:22.506]  You talked about the fire in Hawaii?
[03:08:22.506 --> 03:08:23.246]  Yes.
[03:08:23.246 --> 03:08:25.047]  It looked very suspicious to me.
[03:08:25.047 --> 03:08:28.828]  I think you're right.
[03:08:28.828 --> 03:08:30.388]  I used to doubt ya.
[03:08:32.898 --> 03:08:37.261]  A lot of people I talk to, I try to carry your message, but they say I'm crazy.
[03:08:37.261 --> 03:08:40.524]  Hi, I just wanted to say it's so sad that we've reached this apex where we have been
[03:08:55.413 --> 03:08:58.354]  They're trying to overwhelm us and destabilize us.
[03:08:58.354 --> 03:08:59.134]  I totally agree.
[03:09:25.213 --> 03:09:25.873]  Everything.
[03:09:25.873 --> 03:09:27.775]  And it's bigger than just us.
[03:09:27.775 --> 03:09:44.167]  I want to say to the world, I am embarrassed for the way that some of our leaders have conducted themselves in other countries, and for the things that they have done, and for the things they need to admit to and be held responsible for.
[03:09:44.167 --> 03:09:50.272]  And we are at the end of this plan, this whole plan.
[03:09:50.272 --> 03:09:52.553]  We are the last ones.
[03:09:52.553 --> 03:09:54.475]  If we get together now, if we can
[03:09:55.759 --> 03:09:56.860]  Stop with the division.
[03:09:56.860 --> 03:09:58.100]  Stop with the fighting.
[03:09:58.100 --> 03:10:03.543]  Stop with the left and the right when this religion and that religion, it is bigger than that.
[03:10:03.543 --> 03:10:05.644]  Well, that's exactly what Joe Rogan just said.
[03:10:05.644 --> 03:10:07.305]  We're like, we're already awake, why do we care what he says?
[03:10:07.305 --> 03:10:08.666]  He's got the biggest show out there.
[03:10:08.666 --> 03:10:10.086]  He said, this is not left or right.
[03:10:10.086 --> 03:10:13.668]  This is a globalist attack, corporate attack on humanity.
[03:10:13.668 --> 03:10:17.790]  We've got to come together and stand up for our individual collective rights.
[03:10:17.790 --> 03:10:18.771]  Anything else, Amber?
[03:10:18.771 --> 03:10:19.231]  Great points.
[03:10:20.180 --> 03:10:29.248]  I wanted to say that this has been coming, it's been predicted, and we are all here for a reason right now, and we need to find what that reason is, and right now we need to not be afraid.
[03:10:29.248 --> 03:10:31.790]  We need to be not afraid to speak out.
[03:10:31.790 --> 03:10:37.495]  Because we won't be able to speak out in just a little while, and people think that sounds crazy, and I've been... No, you're not.
[03:10:37.495 --> 03:10:39.817]  They're closing the door on us.
[03:10:39.817 --> 03:10:41.038]  This is bona fide tyranny.
[03:10:41.038 --> 03:10:42.860]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:10:42.860 --> 03:10:44.841]  Yeah, and I've researched a lot.
[03:10:44.841 --> 03:10:45.862]  I started out on CNN.
[03:10:47.861 --> 03:10:48.241]  In 2020.
[03:10:48.241 --> 03:10:54.042]  And look, I've been listening to Alex Jones and anybody else that I can with an open mind all day.
[03:10:54.042 --> 03:10:56.263]  Everybody, just pay attention.
[03:10:56.263 --> 03:10:57.923]  They do not care about you.
[03:10:57.923 --> 03:11:00.504]  They want us gone.
[03:11:00.504 --> 03:11:03.184]  You look at your neighbors and unite.
[03:11:03.184 --> 03:11:05.945]  We don't have to wait for something that is coming.
[03:11:05.945 --> 03:11:06.645]  Absolutely.
[03:11:06.645 --> 03:11:07.125]  Absolutely.
[03:11:07.125 --> 03:11:08.406]  I'm going to let you go.
[03:11:08.406 --> 03:11:09.746]  Thank you for the call, Amber.
[03:11:10.526 --> 03:11:13.708]  All right, I'm going to air a short little promo for like a minute, and then Gerald Salonte takes over.
[03:11:13.708 --> 03:11:16.029]  We're going to skip this break so he gets more time.
[03:11:16.029 --> 03:11:18.031]  I'll always love listening to him every Monday.
[03:11:18.031 --> 03:11:19.171]  I haven't even eaten yet today.
[03:11:19.171 --> 03:11:22.373]  I'm going to eat lunch and listen to him right now in my office.
[03:11:22.373 --> 03:11:24.214]  But I want him to humor me, if he will.
[03:11:24.214 --> 03:11:25.335]  I don't know if he knows about this yet.
[03:11:25.335 --> 03:11:26.396]  It just broke two hours ago.
[03:11:27.276 --> 03:11:31.258]  Reuters got the indictment before the grand jury issued it.
[03:11:31.258 --> 03:11:37.560]  Reuters is confirming that he's been indicted for conspiracy and racketeering and all the rest of it for investigating an election.
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:40.381]  Trump's not perfect, but this is crazy.
[03:11:40.381 --> 03:11:41.701]  And they keep leaking it.
[03:11:41.701 --> 03:11:42.562]  That's a crime.
[03:11:42.562 --> 03:11:46.303]  And that it came out before they indicted him shows how rigged it is.
[03:11:46.303 --> 03:11:47.824]  Maybe Gerald can speak.
[03:11:49.249 --> 03:11:54.690]  So Gerald Cilente takes over right after this short clip promoting Owen Schroyer.
[03:11:54.690 --> 03:11:59.092]  It's going to go live in 50 minutes at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:11:59.092 --> 03:12:07.894]  In a galaxy torn by conflict, where darkness spreads its tendrils across the universe, one hero rises against the immeasurable might of the globalists.
[03:12:07.894 --> 03:12:12.635]  Tune in and trust in the power of the truth to lead us to victory in the great info war.
[03:12:12.635 --> 03:12:16.576]  Prepare for the ultimate battle for truth with today's war room broadcast.
[03:12:17.436 --> 03:12:21.419]  Now, it's your host, Owen Schroyer and his intrepid crew.
[03:12:21.419 --> 03:12:26.503]  Find the show and share the links at infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:12:26.503 --> 03:12:26.923]  3 p.m.
[03:12:26.923 --> 03:12:27.584]  Central.
[03:12:27.584 --> 03:12:28.564]  Stay with us.
[03:12:28.564 --> 03:12:29.165]  Gerald Cilente.
[03:12:41.310 --> 03:12:43.250]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:12:43.250 --> 03:12:55.193]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:12:55.193 --> 03:12:57.353]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:57.353 --> 03:13:09.416]  It's a real privilege and I honor everything that Alex Jones and the team does and how everybody works so hard to give people what they can't get anywhere else in terms of
[03:13:10.140 --> 03:13:13.761]  The videos they do and the information that they put up.
[03:13:13.761 --> 03:13:18.723]  And, um... You know, Alex said he's gonna eat lunch and listen to me, you know?
[03:13:18.723 --> 03:13:20.664]  I don't want to give him agita.
[03:13:20.664 --> 03:13:25.265]  You know, agita's an Italian word, you know, when you're eating and you get upset.
[03:13:25.265 --> 03:13:29.467]  Because I have to be very careful of what I say.
[03:13:29.467 --> 03:13:38.910]  Because my dear friend, Scott Ritter, who I go to dinner with, talk with,
[03:13:40.031 --> 03:13:45.074]  When it comes to my peace and freedom rallies, blacklisted.
[03:13:45.074 --> 03:13:46.514]  Blacklisted.
[03:13:46.514 --> 03:13:48.576]  Oh, I can't say blacklisted.
[03:13:48.576 --> 03:13:52.117]  That would be racist of me.
[03:13:52.117 --> 03:13:54.058]  Because I gotta be careful.
[03:13:54.058 --> 03:13:56.800]  I gotta watch what I say.
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:04.244]  I can no longer call these pieces of scum crap politicians that love war
[03:14:04.984 --> 03:14:08.306]  And those media whores that sell it, prostitutes.
[03:14:08.306 --> 03:14:10.688]  Because I don't want to get blacklisted.
[03:14:10.688 --> 03:14:15.911]  Because Scott Ritter always jokes with me about my language.
[03:14:15.911 --> 03:14:18.713]  I mean, Scott Ritter's a real man.
[03:14:18.713 --> 03:14:22.195]  I mean, this guy was a fighter, a marine.
[03:14:22.195 --> 03:14:24.937]  He believed all the BS.
[03:14:24.937 --> 03:14:29.640]  And that's why he joined the lies.
[03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:33.463]  And then when he became a weapons inspector for the United Nations,
[03:14:34.497 --> 03:14:37.539]  I went to Russia and met the Russian people.
[03:14:37.539 --> 03:14:42.602]  These are people, these are great people, nothing to do with the government.
[03:14:42.602 --> 03:14:44.584]  Blacklisted.
[03:14:44.584 --> 03:14:54.350]  Blacklisted from YouTube for speaking about peace and no war.
[03:14:54.350 --> 03:14:55.731]  America.
[03:14:55.731 --> 03:14:58.213]  A-M-E-R-I-K-A.
[03:15:01.366 --> 03:15:04.868]  Alex was talking about Reuters and they all had this information.
[03:15:04.868 --> 03:15:07.149]  They're prostitutes!
[03:15:07.149 --> 03:15:15.732]  They're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[03:15:15.732 --> 03:15:18.693]  They're little boys and girls of nothing!
[03:15:18.693 --> 03:15:22.615]  Of nothing!
[03:15:22.615 --> 03:15:23.876]  You do what I tell you to do.
[03:15:23.876 --> 03:15:26.737]  Or you only have your job.
[03:15:31.405 --> 03:15:34.766]  That's what we got running and ruining our lives.
[03:15:34.766 --> 03:15:39.088]  So Alex asked about, you know, the information coming about the Trump.
[03:15:39.088 --> 03:15:43.210]  They try to dump Trump the day he got elected.
[03:15:43.210 --> 03:15:46.111]  Nobody ever thought he would win.
[03:15:46.111 --> 03:15:47.372]  Tracking trends.
[03:15:49.524 --> 03:16:01.071]  All you little jerks, arrogant boys and girls that go to Harvard, Princeton and Yale, or Oxford and Cambridge, you don't know anything about trend forecasting.
[03:16:01.071 --> 03:16:02.152]  I do!
[03:16:02.152 --> 03:16:05.514]  Hey, all you slimeballs that hate me.
[03:16:05.514 --> 03:16:09.076]  Trend Tracking, far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:16:09.076 --> 03:16:11.277]  Oh, that was one of my books.
[03:16:11.277 --> 03:16:16.120]  Trends 2000, international bestseller.
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:18.722]  No trends anywhere, we're the only ones that give it to you.
[03:16:19.358 --> 03:16:22.420]  So, going back to the trends in Trump.
[03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:40.253]  Your Trends Journal magazine called Trump a winner in May of 2016 when everybody, everybody, all those little prostitutes said he was going to lose.
[03:16:40.253 --> 03:16:44.116]  The polls show, the polls show, said no, no, he's going to win.
[03:16:44.116 --> 03:16:47.678]  People hate, they hate Clintons.
[03:16:47.678 --> 03:16:48.299]  And Trump,
[03:16:49.019 --> 03:16:52.923]  Sold himself as a guy of the people.
[03:16:52.923 --> 03:16:57.467]  And again, I supported Trump, but lost the view of him.
[03:16:57.467 --> 03:17:06.835]  So what I say is not whether I like somebody, hate somebody, I give you the facts.
[03:17:06.835 --> 03:17:13.481]  They went after Trump day one after he got elected.
[03:17:13.481 --> 03:17:14.782]  The headline in the
[03:17:18.777 --> 03:17:21.159]  USA Today.
[03:17:21.159 --> 03:17:27.683]  New president elected, 17 law cases against him, or something like that.
[03:17:27.683 --> 03:17:30.786]  And then they invented Russiagate.
[03:17:30.786 --> 03:17:39.012]  You read your trends journal, going back to when Russiagate happened.
[03:17:39.012 --> 03:17:43.815]  We said, this is all false information, there's nothing there to support it.
[03:17:43.815 --> 03:17:44.936]  We're putting out the facts.
[03:17:48.010 --> 03:17:51.714]  Then they impeach him.
[03:17:51.714 --> 03:17:54.997]  And we said, this is really stupid crap.
[03:17:54.997 --> 03:18:02.264]  There's no way they're going to get the majority that they need in the Senate to impeach him, regardless of what the House does.
[03:18:02.264 --> 03:18:04.346]  This is just a clown show act.
[03:18:04.346 --> 03:18:06.348]  Do you know why it's a clown show act?
[03:18:06.348 --> 03:18:11.733]  Because you got clowns that are running the act.
[03:18:11.733 --> 03:18:11.933]  Yeah.
[03:18:13.613 --> 03:18:22.919]  What kind of a stupid little boy and girl could you be to look up to Adam Schiff?
[03:18:22.919 --> 03:18:24.580]  I can't spell it right.
[03:18:24.580 --> 03:18:30.424]  He calls it Schiff, but you need an I-T in it because that's all he is.
[03:18:30.424 --> 03:18:31.845]  He's a piece of Schiff.
[03:18:34.935 --> 03:18:40.400]  Hey, Diane Not-So-Feinstein, out of her mind, don't forget to vote.
[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:56.935]  Yeah, put her in a casket and we stupid idiots up in California that bend over and swallow crap shoved in our mouth by that arrogant Gavin Newsom, we'll vote for her.
[03:18:56.935 --> 03:18:58.677]  So they're doing the same thing to Trump.
[03:19:00.208 --> 03:19:04.250]  They want to get rid of him because he's not a member of the club.
[03:19:04.250 --> 03:19:09.893]  Never has been.
[03:19:09.893 --> 03:19:11.334]  And he's on his own trip.
[03:19:11.334 --> 03:19:14.395]  I disagree with him on a number of things, what he did.
[03:19:14.395 --> 03:19:18.818]  I'll never forget, I was talking to Alex before I went on air.
[03:19:18.818 --> 03:19:26.321]  I said, listen Alex, I'm totally opposed to what Trump is doing here with Venezuela.
[03:19:26.321 --> 03:19:29.243]  And I was totally opposed when they assassinated Soleimani.
[03:19:29.810 --> 03:19:33.272]  The general of Iran.
[03:19:33.272 --> 03:19:35.494]  And I said, I know you support him.
[03:19:35.494 --> 03:19:41.318]  I said, but I want, I, I won't talk about, you know, I got to, I want to be careful.
[03:19:41.318 --> 03:19:42.279]  You know, I want to talk about it.
[03:19:42.279 --> 03:19:49.304]  I said, Gerald, InfoWars is about freedom of speech.
[03:19:49.304 --> 03:19:58.310]  It's about putting out information that isn't biased in the sense that is skewing the facts.
[03:19:58.968 --> 03:20:06.190]  It's all about freedom of speech and you say what you want to say.
[03:20:06.190 --> 03:20:07.450]  Yeah.
[03:20:07.450 --> 03:20:09.530]  How many people would say that?
[03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:15.952]  Could you imagine Rupert Murdoch saying that?
[03:20:15.952 --> 03:20:20.093]  Could you imagine the clowns at CNN saying that?
[03:20:20.093 --> 03:20:22.473]  You do what we tell you to do.
[03:20:22.473 --> 03:20:23.873]  All right?
[03:20:23.873 --> 03:20:25.054]  You're a media whore.
[03:20:25.054 --> 03:20:26.134]  You're a prostitute.
[03:20:27.003 --> 03:20:33.046]  You get paid to put out by your corporate pimps and your government whoremasters.
[03:20:33.046 --> 03:20:35.667]  And again, that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:20:35.667 --> 03:20:38.328]  And they're going to do everything to destroy it.
[03:20:38.328 --> 03:20:40.249]  As they're going to do to me.
[03:20:40.249 --> 03:20:42.490]  As they did to Scott Ritter.
[03:20:42.490 --> 03:20:44.171]  This guy's a real man!
[03:20:44.171 --> 03:20:52.034]  I was one of the speakers at the Humanity for Peace rally two weeks ago, two Sundays ago.
[03:20:52.034 --> 03:20:55.776]  Not this Sunday, but the one before.
[03:20:55.776 --> 03:20:56.496]  Less than two weeks.
[03:20:59.557 --> 03:21:06.499]  He was so dynamic, so truthful.
[03:21:06.499 --> 03:21:13.120]  Unlike me, where my Napolitano passion comes out and I call it.
[03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:16.721]  He was very gentlemanly.
[03:21:16.721 --> 03:21:18.441]  And they blacklisted him.
[03:21:18.441 --> 03:21:24.823]  Alex, before I came on the air, was saying that we're in the middle of a revolution.
[03:21:24.823 --> 03:21:29.164]  And words to that were a corporate fascist New World Order has taken over.
[03:21:31.361 --> 03:21:34.942]  100% correct.
[03:21:34.942 --> 03:21:41.444]  A paisano of mine that I'm not fond of, his name was Mussolini.
[03:21:41.444 --> 03:21:48.947]  Google up his definition of fascism.
[03:21:48.947 --> 03:21:58.830]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:21:58.830 --> 03:22:00.070]  And that's what we've become.
[03:22:01.721 --> 03:22:03.662]  The fascist state of America.
[03:22:03.662 --> 03:22:05.844]  Hey!
[03:22:05.844 --> 03:22:08.806]  I'm gonna build a hotel over here.
[03:22:08.806 --> 03:22:10.367]  I want a tax break.
[03:22:10.367 --> 03:22:11.508]  Oh, yes, sir.
[03:22:11.508 --> 03:22:13.349]  Yes, sir.
[03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:14.590]  What do you mean you want a tax break?
[03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:16.111]  Who the hell are you?
[03:22:16.111 --> 03:22:17.592]  I pay taxes.
[03:22:17.592 --> 03:22:20.554]  Yeah, but we're gonna create jobs.
[03:22:20.554 --> 03:22:21.075]  Yes, sir.
[03:22:21.075 --> 03:22:23.296]  We give you a tax break.
[03:22:23.296 --> 03:22:26.058]  Who made up this crap?
[03:22:26.058 --> 03:22:27.859]  How about that Inflation Act?
[03:22:27.859 --> 03:22:28.660]  Whatever they call it.
[03:22:29.525 --> 03:22:32.608]  Giving billions of dollars to companies to open plants.
[03:22:32.608 --> 03:22:33.789]  Are we going to create jobs?
[03:22:33.789 --> 03:22:36.471]  Hey, here's my money!
[03:22:36.471 --> 03:22:37.732]  Screw you!
[03:22:37.732 --> 03:22:42.796]  You're nothing more than a plantation worker with slave land, dear.
[03:22:42.796 --> 03:22:46.219]  We'll steal your money and we'll get you killed.
[03:22:46.219 --> 03:22:48.962]  We could care less about you.
[03:22:48.962 --> 03:22:53.926]  What Alex said is 100% correct.
[03:22:59.039 --> 03:23:04.222]  The corporate attack on humanity.
[03:23:04.222 --> 03:23:07.024]  It's all this is.
[03:23:07.024 --> 03:23:11.106]  The rich are getting richer and everybody else is getting poorer.
[03:23:11.106 --> 03:23:14.908]  Oh, and we're going to talk about the inflation.
[03:23:14.908 --> 03:23:20.351]  What a bunch of crap spewing out of their mouths and inflations.
[03:23:20.351 --> 03:23:21.612]  Oh, it's going away.
[03:23:25.069 --> 03:23:39.893]  The billionaires got $27 trillion richer in two years following the COVID war.
[03:23:39.893 --> 03:23:43.254]  Billions of people.
[03:23:43.254 --> 03:23:45.995]  Lives and livelihoods were destroyed.
[03:23:45.995 --> 03:23:47.976]  Hey!
[03:23:47.976 --> 03:23:50.376]  Grandma!
[03:23:50.376 --> 03:23:52.237]  You're an essential business!
[03:23:53.743 --> 03:23:55.984]  Hey, mom and pop!
[03:23:55.984 --> 03:23:58.244]  We don't need you anymore!
[03:23:58.244 --> 03:24:02.225]  If you were a transgender business, you could stay open!
[03:24:02.225 --> 03:24:08.987]  But mom and pop, screw you!
[03:24:08.987 --> 03:24:13.468]  All the bigs could stay open!
[03:24:13.468 --> 03:24:14.588]  Oh, hey!
[03:24:14.588 --> 03:24:20.630]  You see that latest riot over there, where people went into that, what, Nordstrom's over there in Los Angeles?
[03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:29.079]  All those criminal gangs going in there ripping crap out of the place and running out?
[03:24:29.079 --> 03:24:31.262]  I warned about this in the Trends Journal.
[03:24:31.262 --> 03:24:34.005]  This was not happening before the COVID war.
[03:24:34.005 --> 03:24:37.029]  And don't call it a pandemic!
[03:24:37.029 --> 03:24:38.651]  It was not a pandemic!
[03:24:39.708 --> 03:24:45.569]  It was called a pandemic by those little scum, those little bureaucrats.
[03:24:45.569 --> 03:24:47.510]  Get this in your head, everybody.
[03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:59.992]  A bureaucrat is the dumbest piece of jerk that can't get a job in the real world, that gets into the political system, bends over, takes it up the New York Watt and sucks down everything they could throw.
[03:24:59.992 --> 03:25:04.853]  There it is.
[03:25:04.853 --> 03:25:06.373]  There it is.
[03:25:06.373 --> 03:25:07.874]  Look at this.
[03:25:07.874 --> 03:25:09.114]  America!
[03:25:09.918 --> 03:25:10.819]  Hey!
[03:25:10.819 --> 03:25:12.500]  Can't own a gun!
[03:25:12.500 --> 03:25:13.922]  Can't own a gun!
[03:25:13.922 --> 03:25:16.304]  I'm Gavin Newsom!
[03:25:16.304 --> 03:25:17.665]  I'm Gavin Newsom!
[03:25:17.665 --> 03:25:20.587]  You do what I tell you!
[03:25:20.587 --> 03:25:25.372]  Look how wonderful we've made your state!
[03:25:25.372 --> 03:25:28.334]  Look at the great job we did!
[03:25:28.334 --> 03:25:29.816]  Look at your mayor!
[03:25:29.816 --> 03:25:31.237]  Look at your governor!
[03:25:31.237 --> 03:25:33.319]  Look at your senator!
[03:25:33.319 --> 03:25:35.681]  And look down the toilet bowl!
[03:25:40.035 --> 03:25:43.997]  A toilet bowl that's never been flushed!
[03:25:43.997 --> 03:25:47.339]  Just filled with corporate crap!
[03:25:47.339 --> 03:25:49.801]  So, going on to call it a pandemic.
[03:25:49.801 --> 03:25:53.183]  The World Health Organization called it a pandemic.
[03:25:53.183 --> 03:25:55.824]  You ready?
[03:25:55.824 --> 03:25:57.465]  March 11th.
[03:25:57.465 --> 03:25:58.746]  March 11th, 2020.
[03:25:58.746 --> 03:26:02.308]  Hey, when did the COVID war start?
[03:26:02.308 --> 03:26:05.870]  Started in Yuan City, Yuan.
[03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:07.211]  In China!
[03:26:07.211 --> 03:26:08.252]  Commie China!
[03:26:11.084 --> 03:26:12.004]  When?
[03:26:12.004 --> 03:26:13.885]  Chinese Lunar New Year!
[03:26:13.885 --> 03:26:15.265]  The year of the rat!
[03:26:15.265 --> 03:26:18.266]  Not making that up.
[03:26:18.266 --> 03:26:20.466]  Trans Journal cover, two weeks later.
[03:26:20.466 --> 03:26:24.667]  106 dead in China.
[03:26:24.667 --> 03:26:26.268]  1.4 billion still alive.
[03:26:26.268 --> 03:26:29.428]  New black plague coming.
[03:26:29.428 --> 03:26:31.569]  Going back to calling it a pandemic.
[03:26:31.569 --> 03:26:35.030]  2,200, excuse me, 4,219 people died
[03:26:40.811 --> 03:26:56.921]  Allegedly, from COVID, 4,219 on March 11th, when they called it a pandemic, from 114 countries.
[03:26:56.921 --> 03:26:59.163]  It wasn't a pandemic.
[03:26:59.163 --> 03:27:04.946]  Going back to those riots, when this happened, they locked down everything, destroyed lives.
[03:27:04.946 --> 03:27:09.069]  I said, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:27:09.733 --> 03:27:12.774]  And you're going to see skyrocketing crime.
[03:27:12.774 --> 03:27:15.495]  It's right in your Trends Journal.
[03:27:15.495 --> 03:27:23.157]  Way back in March of 2020, when they called it a pandemic.
[03:27:23.157 --> 03:27:25.598]  The worst is yet to come.
[03:27:25.598 --> 03:27:31.580]  They are going to steal more and more of our rights.
[03:27:31.580 --> 03:27:36.461]  And that's your right, as that woman said, to do something.
[03:27:38.408 --> 03:27:42.491]  It was on the air just before I came on.
[03:27:42.491 --> 03:27:50.956]  And when she and Alex were talking about it, all of this stuff, the protests going on before the COVID war, all locked down, can't do it anymore.
[03:27:50.956 --> 03:27:54.658]  That's why you need to support InfoWars.
[03:27:54.658 --> 03:28:00.742]  And you better put your money where your heart and mind is.
[03:28:00.742 --> 03:28:03.164]  World War III has already begun.
[03:28:04.614 --> 03:28:05.994]  What are my other sayings?
[03:28:05.994 --> 03:28:09.356]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:28:09.356 --> 03:28:11.316]  And Biden is failing.
[03:28:11.316 --> 03:28:13.897]  The economy is failing.
[03:28:13.897 --> 03:28:16.398]  The people are failing.
[03:28:16.398 --> 03:28:17.858]  Hey, want to see any more?
[03:28:17.858 --> 03:28:20.959]  Oh, what did a guy, I just read, I didn't read the whole story.
[03:28:20.959 --> 03:28:27.901]  A guy just stabbed somebody who shot a 76-year-old guy, a guy my age, and went on New York subways.
[03:28:27.901 --> 03:28:29.122]  Yeah.
[03:28:29.122 --> 03:28:32.963]  Oh, the subway system, that's about half of the
[03:28:33.599 --> 03:28:35.601]  Ridership that he used to have before the COVID war?
[03:28:35.601 --> 03:28:39.545]  Yeah.
[03:28:39.545 --> 03:28:41.226]  It's a freak show.
[03:28:41.226 --> 03:28:47.332]  But I gotta be careful, so I have to calm down, and I don't want to give Alex Jones odds, you know?
[03:28:47.332 --> 03:28:52.777]  And you get odds of him from eating all that crap and swallowing it.
[03:28:52.777 --> 03:28:53.458]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:53.458 --> 03:28:53.658]  Stay tuned.
[03:28:56.889 --> 03:29:03.655]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[03:29:03.655 --> 03:29:07.298]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[03:29:07.298 --> 03:29:16.826]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[03:29:16.826 --> 03:29:18.007]  It's about to sell out.
[03:29:18.007 --> 03:29:19.508]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[03:29:19.508 --> 03:29:21.430]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[03:29:56.294 --> 03:30:02.655]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:30:02.655 --> 03:30:09.076]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:30:09.076 --> 03:30:12.437]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:30:12.437 --> 03:30:21.599]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:30:21.599 --> 03:30:22.059]  Look it up.
[03:30:22.699 --> 03:30:24.040]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[03:30:37.946 --> 03:30:39.567]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:30:39.567 --> 03:30:42.788]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:30:42.788 --> 03:30:44.229]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:47.971]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[03:31:07.189 --> 03:31:07.989]  Hey, what's better?
[03:31:07.989 --> 03:31:08.850]  Knockout.

[03:31:10.932 --> 03:31:11.452]  What's better?
[03:31:11.452 --> 03:31:13.734]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:31:13.734 --> 03:31:18.659]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[03:31:19.344 --> 03:31:23.308]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:31:23.308 --> 03:31:24.649]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:31:24.649 --> 03:31:25.950]  They're all very diverse.
[03:31:25.950 --> 03:31:36.139]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[03:33:19.123 --> 03:33:22.505]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.505 --> 03:33:26.287]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:33:29.434 --> 03:33:31.815]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:38.237 --> 03:33:40.638]  Now, I was mentioning about the Trends Journal on a cover.
[03:33:40.638 --> 03:33:45.579]  It's like about, uh, before, uh, Trump.
[03:33:45.579 --> 03:33:49.761]  So here's your cover of your Trends Journal.
[03:33:49.761 --> 03:33:51.061]  This is when he got elected, 2017.
[03:33:51.061 --> 03:33:55.902]  Crusades 2000, Crusader Trump.
[03:33:58.661 --> 03:34:05.965]  Again, like I said, I call it like it is, and I don't... I'm going by the facts.
[03:34:05.965 --> 03:34:11.908]  So what he promised as running for office, to me, he was great.
[03:34:11.908 --> 03:34:17.411]  And the headline reads, playing the Trump card, love him, hate him, respect him, despise him.
[03:34:17.411 --> 03:34:25.676]  The new president has paved the way for change.
[03:34:25.676 --> 03:34:25.816]  Yep.
[03:34:26.206 --> 03:34:32.110]  And we write, unlike the vast majority of media pundits, insiders have missed those Trump card moments.
[03:34:32.110 --> 03:34:36.553]  We're observing events through legacy thinking, political or media bias lenses.
[03:34:36.553 --> 03:34:41.697]  We understood why the country was ready for Trump, the Trump card play.
[03:34:41.697 --> 03:34:48.662]  And we meticulously tracked how Trump used it to seal his political future.
[03:34:48.662 --> 03:34:52.365]  Yep.
[03:34:52.365 --> 03:34:52.525]  Yep.
[03:34:55.697 --> 03:34:59.499]  Then we have trump card tactics.
[03:34:59.499 --> 03:35:00.280]  1.0.
[03:35:00.280 --> 03:35:01.620]  To reach your goals.
[03:35:01.620 --> 03:35:18.770]  And if your objective is to become tops in that field that you want to excel in, whether it's professional or business, whether it's selling products or services, whether it's advancing career, whether it's being a teacher or an expert in a given field, consider playing the trump card.
[03:35:18.770 --> 03:35:19.151]  You ready?
[03:35:19.151 --> 03:35:22.913]  There are no rules.
[03:35:22.913 --> 03:35:23.273]  Yeah.
[03:35:24.625 --> 03:35:27.767]  Trump did what he did, when he had to do it, how he did it.
[03:35:27.767 --> 03:35:32.910]  He didn't go by the game.
[03:35:32.910 --> 03:35:39.414]  If you believe in your heart that what you offer is far superior to the competition, you play the Trump card.
[03:35:39.414 --> 03:35:48.199]  If you have a cause, a purpose, a set of aims you believe are just and worthy, you play the Trump card.
[03:35:48.199 --> 03:35:51.601]  That means that you take out the top.
[03:35:51.601 --> 03:35:52.782]  That's right.
[03:35:52.782 --> 03:35:53.142]  You see,
[03:35:54.642 --> 03:35:55.923]  We can go on with this.
[03:35:55.923 --> 03:35:57.885]  Again, it's in your Trends Journal.
[03:35:57.885 --> 03:36:03.870]  You're getting in the Trends Journal where you're not getting anywhere else in the world.
[03:36:03.870 --> 03:36:09.895]  It's the only magazine in the world that gives you in-depth trends analysis and trend forecasts.
[03:36:09.895 --> 03:36:16.280]  So we tell what the story is, it's being reported, the facts that they give out, and we give our analysis.
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:22.806]  And again, as we mentioned, when you play the trump card, you're your own person, there are no rules.
[03:36:23.706 --> 03:36:29.889]  And which brings me to my dear close combat teacher, John Perkins.
[03:36:29.889 --> 03:36:33.832]  He passed away recently.
[03:36:33.832 --> 03:36:51.141]  And unfortunately, I couldn't go to the memorial because I promised to do the Humanity for Peace event with Scott Ritter down at the UN a week ago Sunday.
[03:36:51.141 --> 03:36:52.302]  There are no rules.
[03:36:53.831 --> 03:36:55.272]  There's no form to the fight.
[03:36:55.272 --> 03:36:59.856]  There's no form to the fight.
[03:36:59.856 --> 03:37:02.838]  And I said, you take out the top.
[03:37:02.838 --> 03:37:07.582]  So if you're in a confrontation, there are a couple of guys there.
[03:37:07.582 --> 03:37:11.665]  And the one that's giving you the bad talk, that's the one you take out first.
[03:37:11.665 --> 03:37:14.808]  You take out the top, the other ones go down.
[03:37:14.808 --> 03:37:18.430]  Trump knew how to do this.
[03:37:18.430 --> 03:37:20.192]  I knew Trump was going to win.
[03:37:22.379 --> 03:37:43.964]  One of the debates, and little Jebby Bush, another little nothing of a nothing, like his other cojone-less brother, George W. Bush, that over 80% of the people swallowed his crap when he took us to the Afghan war.
[03:37:43.964 --> 03:37:51.046]  Here at the debate, and Trump goes over to little Jebby, and puts his arm around him, you know, you know, you're a nice guy, but
[03:37:52.847 --> 03:37:59.529]  And Jeb went with Trump's arm on.
[03:37:59.529 --> 03:38:05.731]  If Trump or anybody came up and put their arm around me and tried to talk to me, off your arms off!
[03:38:05.731 --> 03:38:08.012]  What are you, get your arm off me, man.
[03:38:08.012 --> 03:38:10.832]  Who are you talking to?
[03:38:10.832 --> 03:38:14.133]  I mean, if a friend did it, that's different.
[03:38:14.133 --> 03:38:15.674]  But that's an act of suppression.
[03:38:17.179 --> 03:38:22.741]  So that's when we knew Trump would fight, because, and that woman that called up said, now we have to unite.
[03:38:22.741 --> 03:38:28.383]  He knocked these guys out like that!
[03:38:28.383 --> 03:38:38.786]  Could you imagine Lindsey Graham, the little war hawk boy, the Lindsey, did you come out of the closet yet, Graham, in a fight?
[03:38:38.786 --> 03:38:43.668]  Or little Peter Schiff.
[03:38:46.184 --> 03:38:47.465]  Not Peter Schiff, excuse me.
[03:38:47.465 --> 03:38:50.847]  Peter Schiff is a great guy, a friend of mine.
[03:38:50.847 --> 03:38:52.028]  Adam Schiff.
[03:38:52.028 --> 03:38:57.111]  I spelt it wrong, you need an I and a T in his name.
[03:38:57.111 --> 03:39:00.313]  Little Chuckie Schumer in a fight?
[03:39:00.313 --> 03:39:07.137]  Oh yeah, here's Chuckie Schumer with his glasses, always like this.
[03:39:07.137 --> 03:39:08.458]  And that's where we're in.
[03:39:08.458 --> 03:39:10.859]  We are in the fight for our lives.
[03:39:10.859 --> 03:39:12.660]  That's why Trump won.
[03:39:12.660 --> 03:39:13.821]  And we can win too.
[03:39:15.865 --> 03:39:18.526]  We can win too.
[03:39:18.526 --> 03:39:21.206]  We need a new third party.
[03:39:21.206 --> 03:39:23.607]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:39:23.607 --> 03:39:28.688]  Hey, did you see the poll that came out recently?
[03:39:28.688 --> 03:39:32.729]  America, we're number one in government corruption.
[03:39:32.729 --> 03:39:36.970]  Gallup poll, not making it up.
[03:39:36.970 --> 03:39:40.511]  How stupid can you be to keep supporting these freaks?
[03:39:43.522 --> 03:39:47.564]  Oh, I'm sorry, we're tied with Mexico.
[03:39:47.564 --> 03:39:50.245]  74% of the Americans say the government is corrupt.
[03:39:50.245 --> 03:40:00.790]  Gallupo, not making it up, came out last week.
[03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:03.531]  So there we are.
[03:40:03.531 --> 03:40:06.273]  Now, I said I want to talk about inflation.
[03:40:06.273 --> 03:40:11.475]  It's a lot of BS that there's no inflation.
[03:40:11.475 --> 03:40:13.196]  Places like Unilever,
[03:40:14.676 --> 03:40:21.159]  Heinz, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola.
[03:40:21.159 --> 03:40:31.443]  Their sales volume is down in terms of how much product they're selling, but their revenue is up because their prices went up.
[03:40:31.443 --> 03:40:35.645]  And the prices aren't going to come down.
[03:40:35.645 --> 03:40:40.787]  I have been saying in the Trends Journal that inflation is here to stay.
[03:40:46.906 --> 03:40:57.370]  The price of going to college is over 2,000 times higher than when I got out of graduate school in 1970.
[03:40:57.370 --> 03:41:08.455]  It's not coming down.
[03:41:08.455 --> 03:41:11.817]  The numbers are there.
[03:41:11.817 --> 03:41:12.577]  I love this line.
[03:41:14.019 --> 03:41:20.564]  Shelter costs rose 7.7% in 12 months through July.
[03:41:20.564 --> 03:41:25.007]  This is how they write it in the Wall Street Journal today.
[03:41:25.007 --> 03:41:26.608]  Shelter?
[03:41:26.608 --> 03:41:32.192]  They call living in a home your shelter.
[03:41:32.192 --> 03:41:41.298]  Oh, like you put all these people coming illegally into our country and taking my money to put them in a shelter?
[03:41:41.972 --> 03:41:44.373]  Now I live in a shelter too?
[03:41:44.373 --> 03:41:47.474]  What shelter?
[03:41:47.474 --> 03:41:52.917]  Once upon a time there was a middle class that used to buy their own homes.
[03:41:52.917 --> 03:41:55.038]  Now it's a shelter.
[03:41:55.038 --> 03:42:03.241]  And then they have the nerve and the gall to say it was up 7.7 but was down from March's peak of 8.2.
[03:42:03.241 --> 03:42:05.042]  It's going up every month.
[03:42:09.227 --> 03:42:13.548]  So when they tell you the inflation numbers are going down, it's a lot of BS.
[03:42:13.548 --> 03:42:15.668]  It's Bidenomics!
[03:42:15.668 --> 03:42:18.529]  Of course it's BS!
[03:42:18.529 --> 03:42:25.030]  Bidenomics!
[03:42:25.030 --> 03:42:26.970]  What a joke!
[03:42:26.970 --> 03:42:28.670]  What a freak show!
[03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:30.331]  Don't forget to vote!
[03:42:30.331 --> 03:42:32.471]  Don't forget to vote!
[03:42:32.471 --> 03:42:35.371]  Vote for your freak!
[03:42:35.371 --> 03:42:35.551]  Yep.
[03:42:39.645 --> 03:42:45.387]  Tenants renewing their leases faced an average increase of 5.8% in July.
[03:42:45.387 --> 03:42:50.509]  Oh, but that was down from 11.1% in August last year.
[03:42:50.509 --> 03:42:53.110]  We're gonna be back.
[03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:54.390]  We got a lot to tell you.
[03:42:54.390 --> 03:42:56.911]  And support InfoWars.
[03:42:56.911 --> 03:43:01.773]  For everything the globalists hit us with, God, through Mother Nature, has given us the answer.
[03:43:02.591 --> 03:43:02.851]  I don't have
[03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:26.881]  Because that's who we're getting it from.
[03:43:26.881 --> 03:43:29.583]  Made right here in Central Texas.
[03:43:29.583 --> 03:43:33.226]  Our private label name is Rebel Zen.
[03:43:33.226 --> 03:43:38.831]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country.
[03:43:38.831 --> 03:43:41.633]  It's based right here in Texas, and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[03:43:41.633 --> 03:43:42.734]  And here's what's even crazier.
[03:43:43.454 --> 03:43:45.398]  30% off of what they're selling it for.
[03:43:45.398 --> 03:43:48.663]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[03:43:48.663 --> 03:43:53.030]  So this is the highest rated, already at the lowest price, now even a lower price.
[03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.812]  Rebels In.
[03:43:53.812 --> 03:43:56.176]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com now!
[03:43:56.752 --> 03:43:58.333]  Hey everybody, Rodney Outrine here.
[03:43:58.333 --> 03:44:03.695]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[03:44:03.695 --> 03:44:11.338]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[03:44:11.338 --> 03:44:15.900]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[03:44:15.900 --> 03:44:22.263]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[03:44:22.723 --> 03:44:34.293]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship, that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation in the earth today.
[03:44:34.293 --> 03:44:40.858]  We have graduates going all over the world, from the Arctic to the Outback, and right here, this is what we do.
[03:44:40.858 --> 03:44:44.602]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for
[03:44:45.282 --> 03:44:46.445]  Transformation.
[03:44:46.445 --> 03:44:47.648]  And that's what you'll do.
[03:44:47.648 --> 03:44:55.205]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org and get the free scholarship offered to you by InfoWallace.
[03:44:57.563 --> 03:45:05.708]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[03:45:05.708 --> 03:45:11.191]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:45:11.191 --> 03:45:16.154]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[03:45:17.515 --> 03:45:22.361]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[03:45:22.361 --> 03:45:28.649]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com
[03:45:29.901 --> 03:45:38.789]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.
[03:45:38.789 --> 03:45:43.573]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[03:45:43.573 --> 03:45:48.698]  Get your essential Omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[03:45:48.698 --> 03:45:51.760]  Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil.

[03:45:56.718 --> 03:45:58.920]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:02.924]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:46:02.924 --> 03:46:06.127]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:46:06.127 --> 03:46:13.855]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:46:14.335 --> 03:46:17.938]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:46:17.938 --> 03:46:20.160]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:46:20.160 --> 03:46:22.862]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:46:22.862 --> 03:46:27.426]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:46:27.426 --> 03:46:29.447]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:46:29.447 --> 03:46:31.589]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:46:31.589 --> 03:46:34.391]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[03:46:34.391 --> 03:46:39.475]  Exclusively at InfowarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[03:46:39.475 --> 03:46:42.718]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[03:46:43.078 --> 03:46:45.160]  Get it today and it funds the Info War.
[03:46:45.160 --> 03:46:46.001]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:46:46.001 --> 03:46:52.989]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:46:52.989 --> 03:46:58.215]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:46:58.215 --> 03:47:04.102]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:23.721 --> 03:47:30.226]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.226 --> 03:47:34.330]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:47:37.074 --> 03:47:38.895]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.895 --> 03:47:41.037]  You know, you gotta take that trans journal out of there.
[03:47:41.037 --> 03:47:42.078]  We're gonna change the name.
[03:47:42.078 --> 03:47:44.920]  We're gonna call it the Trans Journal.
[03:47:44.920 --> 03:47:48.903]  Yeah, this way, you know, you don't know what you're getting, but it could be anything.
[03:47:48.903 --> 03:47:51.265]  Ah, what a bunch of crap.
[03:47:51.265 --> 03:47:54.067]  Listen, I gotta make this 100% clear.
[03:47:54.067 --> 03:47:56.089]  I just tell you, my heart is broken.
[03:47:56.089 --> 03:47:59.151]  What happened to my buddy Scott Ritter.
[03:47:59.151 --> 03:48:01.172]  And that they censored him on YouTube.
[03:48:01.172 --> 03:48:03.414]  This is a guy that's a real man.
[03:48:03.414 --> 03:48:05.576]  And he doesn't, unlike me, get emotional.
[03:48:06.602 --> 03:48:08.923]  About issues.
[03:48:08.923 --> 03:48:13.484]  He always uses proper language.
[03:48:13.484 --> 03:48:15.545]  And he's gone.
[03:48:15.545 --> 03:48:18.845]  And they're gonna do the same thing probably to me and everybody else.
[03:48:18.845 --> 03:48:20.966]  And they're gonna do everything they can.
[03:48:20.966 --> 03:48:25.647]  As they've tried so many times to get rid of InfoWars.
[03:48:25.647 --> 03:48:31.229]  And as that woman said about us uniting together and doing everything we can to support each other.
[03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:33.790]  And she's 100% right.
[03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:35.070]  And we have to unite to beat them.
[03:48:36.315 --> 03:48:43.740]  So one of the ways you beat them is by not only supporting InfoWars but making yourself healthier.
[03:48:43.740 --> 03:48:48.504]  And InfoWars has these great products that will help you do that.
[03:48:48.504 --> 03:48:51.966]  So it's that 360 win.
[03:48:51.966 --> 03:49:02.954]  You water what they have and it keeps them going and it keeps you going because it provides very very good health and now they got this deal back
[03:49:03.393 --> 03:49:07.316]  You're going to get 25% off their Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:49:16.163 --> 03:49:20.246]  And again, they've been out of stock for this because so many people are buying it.
[03:49:20.246 --> 03:49:30.854]  This really boosts your natural systems and you get all the, many of the essential vitamins and minerals and nutrients that you can with the Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:49:33.379 --> 03:49:33.519]  Yes.

[03:50:25.081 --> 03:50:26.822]  I tell people, they say, what can we do?
[03:50:26.822 --> 03:50:30.703]  I said, you got to get in the best shape you can physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:50:30.703 --> 03:50:34.584]  You're in a fight for your life and these help that fight for your life.

[03:50:35.064 --> 03:50:36.505]  They're going to run out of stock again.
[03:50:36.505 --> 03:50:40.006]  This is a big seller and it boosts your natural systems.

[03:50:45.707 --> 03:50:50.629]  You go to InfoWarsStore.com InfoWarsStore.com
[03:50:53.573 --> 03:50:58.095]  All right.
[03:50:58.095 --> 03:51:02.216]  Christmas savings in August.
[03:51:02.216 --> 03:51:05.758]  And so I got my red shirt on for Christmas time.
[03:51:05.758 --> 03:51:07.258]  So I was talking about inflation.
[03:51:07.258 --> 03:51:11.080]  There's this guy by the name of John Williams at Shadow Stats.
[03:51:11.080 --> 03:51:13.181]  Inflation up like in a 12% numbers.
[03:51:13.181 --> 03:51:15.462]  It's way above what they're saying.
[03:51:15.462 --> 03:51:19.423]  So they came out with the listing of things that went up in the last.
[03:51:19.423 --> 03:51:21.404]  I'm saying inflation has not ended.
[03:51:22.139 --> 03:51:23.540]  It's with us.
[03:51:23.540 --> 03:51:28.705]  Yeah, it's not going up at the same rate, but the prices aren't going down.
[03:51:28.705 --> 03:51:34.471]  I said, they're losing sales numbers, so they're raising their prices.
[03:51:34.471 --> 03:51:38.715]  It's greedflation, and it's also shrinkflation.
[03:51:38.715 --> 03:51:40.696]  They're giving you less for your money.
[03:51:40.696 --> 03:51:43.139]  Hey, don't you know who I am?
[03:51:44.847 --> 03:51:47.089]  You can only do that with the Italians.
[03:51:47.089 --> 03:51:49.470]  You can't do it to the rest of the crooks.
[03:51:49.470 --> 03:51:53.273]  You only can make fun of- Oh, Italian lives don't matter.
[03:51:53.273 --> 03:51:54.574]  Hey, we're criminals.
[03:51:54.574 --> 03:51:56.075]  Oh, but not the bankers.
[03:51:56.075 --> 03:51:57.336]  No, no, no.
[03:51:57.336 --> 03:52:07.523]  Selenti, they're proper gentlemen, like all of these hedge funds and private equity groups and venture capitalists.
[03:52:07.523 --> 03:52:10.265]  Yeah.
[03:52:10.265 --> 03:52:13.387]  I'm sick of this soprano crap.
[03:52:14.249 --> 03:52:16.610]  Do that to all the other nationalities.
[03:52:16.610 --> 03:52:21.192]  I want to see a show like that with the blacks and the Jews.
[03:52:21.192 --> 03:52:22.773]  Yeah, and all the different nationalities.
[03:52:22.773 --> 03:52:24.254]  Yeah, put all those nationalities.
[03:52:24.254 --> 03:52:29.696]  I want to see the Irish drunken show every day, alright?
[03:52:29.696 --> 03:52:33.538]  You only do it to the Italians.
[03:52:33.538 --> 03:52:35.759]  So, going back to the crime syndicate.
[03:52:36.607 --> 03:52:42.874]  When the Italians, when the Mafia, oh yeah, they charge you an 8% interest.
[03:52:42.874 --> 03:52:45.417]  Oh yeah, but we're the credit card companies.
[03:52:45.417 --> 03:52:47.679]  We could charge whatever we want.
[03:52:47.679 --> 03:52:48.520]  28%, 30%, 500%.
[03:52:48.520 --> 03:52:53.145]  Oh, but we're members of the club.
[03:52:53.145 --> 03:52:54.647]  You're just a little guinea.
[03:52:54.647 --> 03:52:56.669]  Yeah.
[03:52:56.669 --> 03:52:57.570]  I got beat up.
[03:52:59.235 --> 03:53:02.277]  The Irish used to hate the Italians when I was a kid.
[03:53:02.277 --> 03:53:05.179]  But I fell in love with the Irish girls.
[03:53:05.179 --> 03:53:07.481]  I love the Irish girls.
[03:53:07.481 --> 03:53:10.003]  Here, I got the proof right here.
[03:53:10.003 --> 03:53:14.686]  When I was a kid, the Irish and Italians didn't... The Irish didn't like the Italians.
[03:53:14.686 --> 03:53:18.248]  And I had an Irish nun that destroyed my life.
[03:53:18.248 --> 03:53:22.291]  And I talked about my buddy John Perkins who taught me close combat.
[03:53:22.291 --> 03:53:24.172]  And that's what got me back to me being me.
[03:53:24.172 --> 03:53:24.953]  Here.
[03:53:24.953 --> 03:53:25.874]  Here I am.
[03:53:25.874 --> 03:53:26.174]  See that?
[03:53:26.889 --> 03:53:30.591]  Me and Teresa McKelvey at our first communion.
[03:53:30.591 --> 03:53:34.412]  We used to hold hands and kiss.
[03:53:34.412 --> 03:53:36.593]  18th is my book, What Zizi Gave Honey Boy.
[03:53:36.593 --> 03:53:40.575]  Of everything I've ever written, and been writing for a long time, this is my favorite.
[03:53:40.575 --> 03:53:42.616]  You get it at TrendsJournal.com.
[03:53:42.616 --> 03:53:45.217]  It's about what life used to be, how blessed I am.
[03:53:45.217 --> 03:53:48.559]  Annapolitano, born in the Bronx.
[03:53:48.559 --> 03:53:49.419]  Anyway.
[03:53:49.419 --> 03:53:51.580]  Cider's Irish nun.
[03:53:51.580 --> 03:53:53.341]  Sister Marie Rosaire.
[03:53:53.341 --> 03:53:55.082]  You should see the look on her, boy.
[03:53:56.568 --> 03:54:01.431]  So I had a brother that talked me into going to Catholic school because I needed discipline.
[03:54:01.431 --> 03:54:09.375]  And again, one of the first rules that we wrote about Trump, Crusade Trump, you don't follow orders.
[03:54:09.375 --> 03:54:12.777]  And I was a kid that didn't follow orders, so they hated me for that.
[03:54:12.777 --> 03:54:17.479]  In the fifth grade, a nun grabbed me by my little blue tie and started beating me up.
[03:54:17.479 --> 03:54:17.839]  BOOM!
[03:54:17.839 --> 03:54:18.219]  BOOM!
[03:54:18.219 --> 03:54:19.040]  BOOM!
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:20.160]  BOOM!
[03:54:20.160 --> 03:54:23.042]  Perfected my middle ear and broke my eardrum.
[03:54:23.042 --> 03:54:23.182]  Yeah.
[03:54:27.796 --> 03:54:30.237]  That's right.
[03:54:30.237 --> 03:54:33.337]  Italian lies don't matter.
[03:54:33.337 --> 03:54:35.558]  I used to go water skiing in the Hudson River.
[03:54:35.558 --> 03:54:39.599]  It was just a belt on.
[03:54:39.599 --> 03:54:43.840]  And I could do a slalom ski at 10 years old going over the wakes of ships.
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:46.801]  You'd have ships in those days going up and down the Hudson.
[03:54:46.801 --> 03:54:52.202]  And I could never get my ears wet again the rest of my life.
[03:54:52.202 --> 03:54:53.822]  Yeah.
[03:54:53.822 --> 03:54:57.163]  So going back to discrimination and on and on and on.
[03:54:57.714 --> 03:55:02.596]  It's a freak show, and they teach you to hate the people they want you to hate.
[03:55:02.596 --> 03:55:04.837]  Hate the Russians.
[03:55:04.837 --> 03:55:07.117]  Hate the Vietnamese.
[03:55:07.117 --> 03:55:11.819]  World War II, hate the Japanese.
[03:55:11.819 --> 03:55:16.201]  Oh, Pearl Harbor, know the real story.
[03:55:16.201 --> 03:55:19.322]  And that's what InfoWars is giving you, what nobody else is giving you.
[03:55:20.091 --> 03:55:33.418]  So I'm going to go back to, oh, by the way, as bad as this nun ruined my life, I'm just thankful Father Foley was a ladies man, because boy, the Catholic Church has some reputation in that.
[03:55:33.418 --> 03:55:35.279]  Inflation numbers.
[03:55:35.279 --> 03:55:40.402]  Motor vehicle insurance up 17.8%.
[03:55:40.402 --> 03:55:45.345]  Motor vehicle maintenance repairs up 12.7%.
[03:55:45.345 --> 03:55:48.887]  Frozen foods, fruits and vegetables up
[03:55:52.965 --> 03:55:54.506]  11.8%.
[03:55:54.506 --> 03:55:55.706]  White bread.
[03:55:55.706 --> 03:55:57.687]  Why that's racist!
[03:55:57.687 --> 03:56:00.028]  Stop calling it white bread!
[03:56:00.028 --> 03:56:03.489]  And none of you blacks eat it!
[03:56:03.489 --> 03:56:03.689]  Up 10.7%.
[03:56:03.689 --> 03:56:06.710]  Who'd eat that crap?
[03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:10.231]  White bread.
[03:56:10.231 --> 03:56:11.151]  Sugar and sweets.
[03:56:11.151 --> 03:56:11.171]  8.9%.
[03:56:11.171 --> 03:56:12.391]  Uncooked poultry.
[03:56:12.391 --> 03:56:12.431]  9.4%.
[03:56:12.431 --> 03:56:13.112]  On and on and on.
[03:56:13.112 --> 03:56:15.712]  This inflation is real.
[03:56:22.421 --> 03:56:23.622]  Here he goes.
[03:56:23.622 --> 03:56:25.303]  Got to make this quick.
[03:56:25.303 --> 03:56:30.105]  When they lower interest rates, the dollar is going to go down.
[03:56:30.105 --> 03:56:35.608]  Inflation is going to go up and gold prices are going to go to new highs.
[03:56:35.608 --> 03:56:43.772]  I am forecasting gold will be at $2,200 plus an ounce by the end of this year.
[03:56:43.772 --> 03:56:50.936]  And you better get ready for what's going to happen to the markets by late September.
[03:56:50.936 --> 03:56:51.416]  October.
[03:56:52.518 --> 03:56:56.479]  It's summertime and the living is easy.
[03:56:56.479 --> 03:56:59.640]  You spread your wings and you make for the sky.
[03:56:59.640 --> 03:57:02.341]  People don't have a clue what's going on.
[03:57:02.341 --> 03:57:05.702]  Hey, they don't know about all those bank degrades.
[03:57:05.702 --> 03:57:05.922]  Yep.
[03:57:05.922 --> 03:57:07.322]  They don't know anything about that.
[03:57:07.322 --> 03:57:08.922]  That happened last week.
[03:57:08.922 --> 03:57:09.503]  A Fitch.
[03:57:09.503 --> 03:57:10.643]  What's a Fitch?
[03:57:10.643 --> 03:57:12.163]  Downgrading the United States credit.
[03:57:12.163 --> 03:57:13.064]  What's a Fitch?
[03:57:13.064 --> 03:57:14.344]  Never heard of that.
[03:57:14.344 --> 03:57:14.524]  Nope.
[03:57:15.660 --> 03:57:24.752]  Typical American households spend $709 more in July than they did two years ago to buy the same goods and services according to Moody's Analytics.
[03:57:24.752 --> 03:57:26.114]  All right?
[03:57:26.114 --> 03:57:27.536]  You better prepare for the worst.
[03:57:28.656 --> 03:57:34.560]  InfoWars is helping you prepare and your Trends Journal history before it happens.
