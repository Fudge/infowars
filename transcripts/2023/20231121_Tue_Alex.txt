[00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:07.106]  It's Tuesday, November 21st, 2023.
[00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:10.409]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:15.813]  Strap yourselves in, my friends.
[00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:16.914]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:18.115]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:18.476]  Today.
[00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:24.937]  Now let's go ahead and show the George Soros funded response to the NRA.
[00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:27.338]  Okay, let's lay out the facts to these useful idiots.
[00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:30.019]  Let's look at these useful morons on screen for TV viewers.
[00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.462]  I mean we're talking hundred and something blacks shot and killed by cops every year.
[00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:41.645]  Most of the time it's actually black officers doing it because to stop all the red stuff they mainly put black officers in the black areas now.
[00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.142]  So, you've got a hundred and something blacks being killed, some of them innocent, it's wrong.
[00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:50.885]  You've got thousands of blacks killed in Chicago every year by blacks that aren't even on the radar screen.
[00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:56.930]  You've got most of the blacks never getting born being killed by the globalists, by the liberals, by the abortuaries.
[00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:07.178]  Then you've got the gangster black culture, rap music that pushes blacks to act like thugs, everybody else, so they're inducted into the prison system so that the schools do become pipelines into prison.
[00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:09.740]  That's one of the only true things that that ignorant woman said.
[00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:17.337]  But again, now that they're going to try to get blacks to act more racist, act more violent, and Black Lives Matter groups are going to push killing cops...
[00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:27.828]  Which are totally innocent, getting shot in the back of the head, like this poor black cop got executed last week in New York, and then the mayor wouldn't even go to her funeral, or memorial.
[00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:32.792]  Went and helped run the riots over in Germany, which CNN said weren't riots.
[00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:40.117]  They're trying to start a revolution, and Black Lives Matter is the most idiotic, moron group, and is now bordering on terrorism, and is being sued for it.
[00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:41.798]  So good luck, idiots.
[00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:47.682]  Facts don't matter to people like Black Lives Matter, because they go out and find chip on the shoulder,
[00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.596]  Arrested development.
[00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:52.918]  Racist.
[00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.264]  We want to blame every problem in the world with white people.
[00:01:57.273 --> 00:02:03.615]  And you see that in the news where major universities are teaching coast-to-coast the problem with whiteness.
[00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:07.976]  Professors every day are in the news saying whites need to be exterminated.
[00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:12.877]  White professors are saying if you are pregnant with a white baby, abort the baby.
[00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:14.617]  Whites are inherently evil.
[00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:16.218]  Genetically, they're inherently bad.
[00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:21.179]  This is complete Hitlerism turned on its head and deployed by the left.
[00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:24.603]  And everybody knows we're not exaggerating.
[00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:45.353]  The left is so racist, so race-baiting, inculcating, wounding the minds of black people particularly, with such foaming at the mouth, anti-white, black nationalism, it is meant to put them into their total minority group and prep by gangster rap for prison.
[00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:46.634]  So the very conduit
[00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:55.144]  Of school to prison that Black Lives Matter was talking about earlier in that video.
[00:02:55.144 --> 00:03:04.691]  That conduit, probably being produced by some liberal white guy, we don't find it by Soros, is actually being run by them.
[00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.632]  And that's the fact.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.782]  There are some bad cops that shoot people they shouldn't.
[00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:11.304]  Everybody knows that.
[00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:15.647]  The point is George Soros and the globalists know there's a rebellion against the corrupt government.
[00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:17.208]  They know there's a mass awakening.
[00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:23.093]  They want to short-circuit it with a bunch of race-baiting, race-fighting, and everybody killing each other.
[00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:24.194]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:25.855]  They're trying to start a race war.
[00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:28.457]  And a lot of people are self-centered out there in the population.
[00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:31.380]  They think, I'm against a race war because I'm afraid.
[00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:36.537]  They think I'm against a race war because I'm scared I'm going to get killed.
[00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:38.339]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:42.282]  I'm scared you're going to get killed.
[00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:43.283]  I've got security.
[00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:44.924]  I've got firearms.
[00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:50.228]  I live defended, behind a gate, behind walls.
[00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:57.274]  If there's a race war in this country, it's going to be the minorities that share the main brunt of the slaughterhouse.
[00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:00.779]  And that's not a threat, that's a fact!
[00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.201]  But why would I feel good if you got killed?
[00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:06.184]  I'm trying to keep you from aborting your children!
[00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:14.791]  I'm trying to tell Mexicans that they've got a five-year program to forcibly inoculate every Mexican girl at the age of 11, and it's been linked to sterilization!
[00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.394]  But you're La Raza, funded by the Fortune 500.
[00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:24.760]  You're Mecha, funded by George Soros and the big foundations, wants to wound you with racist Chicano
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:43.585]  Brainwashing to keep you stunted under their control in your barrio under the management of your local Mexican politico Don in the Mexican mafia that keeps your people down and sells you drugs and pipelines you into the prison.
[00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:47.546]  But nobody sells out their people like the black leaders and that's well known.

[00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:17.208]  Populists and anti-globalists are getting elected all over the world.
[00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:19.532]  More than 80% of the regional and national elections.
[00:06:19.532 --> 00:06:20.654]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:22.296]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:22.296 --> 00:06:27.044]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:30.166]  It's Tuesday, November 21st, 2023.
[00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.547]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:35.030]  And it's 349 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 30 seconds.
[00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.456]  Until the most important election in world history.
[00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:19.412]  Bang your head, ladies and gentlemen, right into the face of the New World Order.
[00:07:19.412 --> 00:07:23.075]  Metal health will drive you mad!
[00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.115]  It'll cure your crazy!
[00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:28.097]  Woo!
[00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:34.281]  That's some poetry right there.
[00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:36.382]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:40.105]  The transmission is live.
[00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:40.645]  Unfiltered.
[00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:44.887]  Uncensored.
[00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:48.293]  I really wanna be overrated.
[00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:01.075]  All right, let's get serious.
[00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:03.457]  I mean, I really can't talk enough about this.
[00:08:03.457 --> 00:08:04.677]  I've been trying to compile the numbers.
[00:08:04.677 --> 00:08:10.480]  I haven't gotten an exact number, but I spent about an hour this morning at about 6 a.m.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:21.065]  just scanning over the recent elections in the last year around the world, and around 80% of national elections
[00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:26.385]  And regional elections are very similar.
[00:08:26.385 --> 00:08:38.829]  Provinces and states and jurisdictions are going to not just conservatives, not just nationalists, but hardcore anti-New World Order people.
[00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:48.852]  The problem is every day there are reports of leaders or deputy leaders
[00:08:51.514 --> 00:09:15.400]  Of these movements being shot in the face, stabbed in the stomach, run over by cars, beer bottles being broken over their heads while they eat dinner with their family, and it just happened with the leader of the Dutch far-right anti-globalist populist party, who's a big listener by the way, with a bottle broken over his head.
[00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:20.655]  And so, and he's in the hospital, fractured his skull.
[00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:21.595]  So this is going on everywhere.
[00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:28.136]  Meanwhile, we have Congressman Representative Goldman issues apology after what he said must happen to Trump.
[00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:31.837]  Trump must be eliminated.
[00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:42.480]  So they're the ones pushing the majority of the violence while saying that populists and conservatives who are winning the hearts and minds are going to resort to violence.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.420]  Because we're winning?
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.361]  No, they're the ones that are resorting to violence.
[00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:52.791]  And I've got the new talking point you've seen everywhere that Trump is Hitler 2.0.
[00:09:52.791 --> 00:10:08.482]  And I've got MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, ABC, I've got all the clips here, saying Trump is going to jail and kill his political opposition if he wins the president in 340-something days.
[00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:10.864]  No, it's you guys that are jailing your opposition.
[00:10:10.864 --> 00:10:16.868]  It's you guys on that very show with Mika Brzezinski and Joe Psycho Scarborough.
[00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:20.576]  You know, the dead intern?
[00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:22.357]  Brains beaten out?
[00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:25.019]  Friendly guy?
[00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:28.942]  Her father was the top globalist for decades?
[00:10:28.942 --> 00:10:40.590]  They're the ones saying they want to outlaw their political opposition, and then they flip it and say, we're going to put them in jail.
[00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:46.654]  Trump said he didn't want to put his political opposition in jail when he first got in, even though they were trying to put him in jail and saying he was a Russian agent.
[00:10:46.654 --> 00:10:47.575]  He said he wants them to just
[00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.716]  Get out of the way.
[00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:57.819]  And they're the ones trying to outlaw their political opposition and create a one-party unistate because they are losing and losing big time.
[00:10:57.819 --> 00:10:58.560]  We've got those clips.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.122]  I'm going to be getting to that coming up.
[00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:14.208]  Despite the media, the corporate media, trying to outlaw the idea of saying elections could be rigged, there's just evidence of it massively all over the United States, but they can't beat landslides.
[00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:14.868]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.992]  Really big news.
[00:11:17.992 --> 00:11:23.014]  I mean, this is really the biggest news geopolitically.
[00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:32.158]  The State Department's been putting out a bunch of statements that they want the war to end and that they want Zelensky to come to the peace table.
[00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:40.962]  We've got clips of MSNBC and a bunch of other establishment mouthpieces saying Ukraine has lost the war with Russia.
[00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:43.323]  And so I would look for them to be taking out
[00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:59.556]  Zelensky, they'll either say he's corrupt, which he is, and use that to have him be removed, or he'll die of a drug overdose, or somebody will kill him, and they'll blame it on the Russians, but they always hang out to dry their failures.
[00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:03.879]  And I think they're not going to, you know, ever completely admit defeat, NATO.
[00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:08.102]  But as of now, Russia did exactly what Russia said they would do.
[00:12:09.451 --> 00:12:19.858]  They took Crimea, they took most of the South, they took a lot of the East, they took all the key infrastructure that Russia built, and where it's 98% Russian speaking, I mean Ukrainians Russian too.
[00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:23.760]  Russia was founded in Ukraine a thousand years ago, but that's just history.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.225]  But since then it's been the battleground between Western Europe and Russia for hundreds of years.
[00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:32.846]  And they now admit that Russia has won.
[00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:36.429]  Of course we told you that six months ago.
[00:12:38.134 --> 00:12:47.904]  The West, Glenn Greenwald points out, is now telling Zelensky more or less explicitly and right out in the open, it's time to wrap this up.
[00:12:47.904 --> 00:12:52.809]  We are focused on setting the conditions for a just, durable and sustainable peace.
[00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:53.589]  And the U.S.
[00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:59.936]  mission to NATO put out another statement, Ukraine has taken back more than half of its territory seized by Russian forces.
[00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:05.463]  Since February 2022, it is tough and dynamic battle.
[00:13:05.463 --> 00:13:07.725]  Ukraine soldiers are fighting bravely every day.
[00:13:07.725 --> 00:13:11.327]  They continue to inspire the world with the bravery and courage.
[00:13:11.327 --> 00:13:17.331]  And it goes on to say that we will now be focused on setting an end to the war.
[00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:21.293]  So that's a big deal.
[00:13:21.293 --> 00:13:28.238]  And 68% of Americans in a Gallup poll of similar numbers across the board are against what Israel is doing.
[00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:32.860]  And are against the carpet bombing of Gaza.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:40.522]  And so now Netanyahu is coming to the table to use a hostage release as a pretext, I guess, to start winding that down.
[00:13:40.522 --> 00:13:43.823]  I'm not saying that's been winded down yet or will wind down.
[00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.184]  And I want to be completely clear.
[00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:47.885]  I don't sit here and try to make friends.
[00:13:47.885 --> 00:13:51.746]  I don't sit here and try to choose sides other than just promoting basic human freedom.
[00:13:52.662 --> 00:14:04.308]  The media has cherry-picked a lot of what I've said about Israel the last few weeks and said lovingly, I mean it's all over Twitter, it's all over everywhere, I can't even, I'm not even looking for it, I just see it everywhere.
[00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:10.472]  Millions of views here, millions of views there, hundreds of thousands here, hundreds of thousands there, of like 30 second clips of me.
[00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:16.025]  Well, I'm blowing up at the groups in Israel that want to ship the Gazans here.
[00:14:16.025 --> 00:14:24.247]  The Arabs won't take them, because they know how dangerous they are, and almost 80% say they're terrorists, say they want to blow stuff up, say they want to destroy America.
[00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:35.669]  And I'm really mad at the Israeli politicians, including some American politicians, like, you know, I like Breitbart, but the main editor of Breitbart's, like, saying we need to take them, and I mean, no!
[00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:38.249]  So yeah, I blew up at some of the groups in Israel doing that.
[00:14:38.249 --> 00:14:39.670]  I don't hate Israel.
[00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.690]  I don't believe from the
[00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:46.620]  River to the sea, and I don't support Hamas, and I don't support what Hamas did on October 7th.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.583]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:14:49.583 --> 00:14:58.070]  I don't support what Hamas did, and I think Israel went way too far, and has gotten a major political black eye doing this.
[00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:04.675]  But at the same time, they've gone and they've polled the Palestinians, and upwards of 80%
[00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:10.687]  Believe Israel doesn't have a right to exist and also hate America.
[00:15:10.687 --> 00:15:17.089]  And you've had the head of Hamas, you've had the head of Hezbollah say they're going to start attacking targets inside the United States.
[00:15:17.089 --> 00:15:25.571]  And then when that happens, we'll have our rights taken and they'll expand the TSA from groping our genitals at the airports to the bus stations, which is their plan.
[00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:30.673]  So I am against Hamas and I'm against a lot of the things Israel's doing.
[00:15:30.673 --> 00:15:33.493]  That should really be simple.
[00:15:33.493 --> 00:15:35.434]  I don't hate the Muslims.
[00:15:37.162 --> 00:15:39.083]  But they're always constantly fighting with each other, too.
[00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.884]  The Arab countries won't take the Palestinians.
[00:15:40.884 --> 00:15:43.985]  So I just say you stay right there in your sandbox.
[00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.887]  And you're not my job, especially when you love the left and merge with it.
[00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:49.328]  And the same thing goes for Israel.
[00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:50.689]  Israel's in a civil war.
[00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:51.749]  Netanyahu's unpopular.
[00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:54.991]  It's not like there's one thing in Israel and, you know, it's one power bloc.
[00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:56.772]  And I'm very upset at Israel as well.
[00:15:56.772 --> 00:15:57.232]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.143 --> 00:16:06.131]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:10.816]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:16:10.816 --> 00:16:15.202]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:16:16.623 --> 00:16:19.664]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:16:19.664 --> 00:16:21.225]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:27.187]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:16:27.187 --> 00:16:33.209]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:35.970]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:16:37.876 --> 00:16:39.197]  I don't know.
[00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:04.229]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[00:17:04.229 --> 00:17:08.132]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[00:17:08.132 --> 00:17:13.276]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:15.357]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:17:15.357 --> 00:17:17.619]  I'll eat your heads!
[00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.421]  You Nazi scum!
[00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:22.943]  Let's free the patriots and defeat the globalist techniques!
[00:17:24.528 --> 00:17:29.075]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[00:17:29.075 --> 00:17:30.838]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:43.208]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:44.249]  Oh, big deal.
[00:17:44.249 --> 00:17:46.029]  I'm taking you down, rapist.
[00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:49.830]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:56.892]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:07.784]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[00:18:07.784 --> 00:18:09.165]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:11.106]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[00:18:11.106 --> 00:18:13.348]  These products are incredible.
[00:18:13.348 --> 00:18:17.191]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:27.800]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:31.380]  We've got 3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.862]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:18:36.862 --> 00:18:41.424]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[00:18:41.424 --> 00:18:48.287]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:18:48.287 --> 00:18:54.490]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:04.336]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:06.318]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[00:19:06.318 --> 00:19:08.360]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.822]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:19:10.822 --> 00:19:11.643]  Hey, what's better?
[00:19:11.643 --> 00:19:12.504]  Knockout?
[00:19:12.504 --> 00:19:13.845]  What's better?
[00:19:13.845 --> 00:19:14.586]  Down and out?
[00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.106]  What's better?
[00:19:15.106 --> 00:19:17.389]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:22.314]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:26.960]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.301]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:29.603]  They're all very diverse.
[00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:39.794]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:50.678]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep, and it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.
[00:19:50.678 --> 00:20:00.621]  So get your M4 Wars MD, good night's sleep today, at m4warsware.com.
[00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:06.503]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.566 --> 00:20:33.370]  We're good to go.
[00:20:54.341 --> 00:21:01.085]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're coming in here with some incredible A.I.
[00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:04.407]  This is the type of dreams I've been having since I was about three years old.
[00:21:04.407 --> 00:21:07.228]  Like this exactly.
[00:21:07.228 --> 00:21:13.492]  Oh man, it's really tapping into the group, the human group subconscious.
[00:21:13.492 --> 00:21:20.416]  Amazing.
[00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:21.757]  Give me back my book!
[00:21:21.757 --> 00:21:22.497]  Ha ha ha!
[00:21:25.894 --> 00:21:42.289]  I ain't gonna see more damage done.
[00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:44.170]  Alright, so it's official.
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.792]  Major insurance companies.
[00:21:45.792 --> 00:21:46.873]  We broke it two years ago.
[00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:47.954]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:21:47.954 --> 00:21:49.856]  20 plus million filled by the shots.
[00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:54.215]  Got a lot of big news on that coming up.
[00:21:54.215 --> 00:22:02.401]  Also, IMF director says CBDCs will replace cash and will increase financial inclusion and control how you spend your money.
[00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:05.504]  They're just throwing the gauntlet down in front of everybody.
[00:22:05.504 --> 00:22:08.006]  That's why we've got to counter their global tyranny.
[00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:18.731]  And have a transnational coalition of nations that work together in common good and respect for the people and their rights and sovereignty to challenge it.
[00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:30.016]  And that's why Javier Mele, for people who don't know, it's important to at least mention this week, reading from Zero Edge, that under the wild exterior, Mele has it where it counts.
[00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:35.419]  He has two master's degrees and has been a professor of macroeconomics, economics of growth,
[00:22:36.536 --> 00:22:41.099]  Microeconomics and mathematics for economists, and it just goes on from there.
[00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:44.421]  Successful businessman, the list goes on and on.
[00:22:44.421 --> 00:22:48.464]  So they are really scared of him.
[00:22:48.464 --> 00:22:53.968]  And it's sending shockwaves through the globalist power structure.
[00:22:53.968 --> 00:22:56.469]  And we absolutely must challenge these people.
[00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:58.531]  Here's a little clip of him right after he got elected.
[00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:09.926]  With a board up on the wall, speaking Spanish, saying, gone, gone, out, out, as he sits there and pulls the different agencies off the board that he's getting rid of.
[00:23:09.926 --> 00:23:17.351]  All these agencies, globalist trained, globalist controlled, like the Office of Sustainability that's under the UN's UNESCO.
[00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:17.652]  Here it is.
[00:23:21.786 --> 00:23:22.627]  Ministry of Culture.
[00:23:22.627 --> 00:23:23.147]  Out!
[00:23:23.147 --> 00:23:27.130]  Ministry of Sustainable Environment and Development.
[00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.451]  Out!
[00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:31.273]  Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity.
[00:23:31.273 --> 00:23:32.253]  Out!
[00:23:32.253 --> 00:23:34.395]  Ministry of Public Speech.
[00:23:34.395 --> 00:23:34.695]  Out!
[00:23:34.695 --> 00:23:36.856]  Even if you resist.
[00:23:36.856 --> 00:23:39.638]  Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation.
[00:23:39.638 --> 00:23:40.379]  Out!
[00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:42.440]  Ministry of Tobacco and Social Security.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.860]  Out!
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.201]  Ministry of Education.
[00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:44.422]  Out!
[00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:45.242]  Ministry of Transport.
[00:23:45.242 --> 00:23:45.662]  Out!
[00:23:45.662 --> 00:23:46.783]  Ministry of Health.
[00:23:46.783 --> 00:23:46.843]  Out!
[00:23:58.949 --> 00:24:01.170]  The thievery of politics is over.
[00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:06.194]  Long live damn liberty.
[00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:08.035]  All right, I want to do this.
[00:24:08.035 --> 00:24:11.838]  It feels like a Friday because we have Thanksgiving coming up, but it's not.
[00:24:11.838 --> 00:24:13.879]  It's a Tuesday.
[00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:15.821]  And I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:24:16.869 --> 00:24:18.690]  For everybody.
[00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:24.415]  Any subject, any topic, anything you want to cover, anything you want to get into, there are no limits.
[00:24:24.415 --> 00:24:28.838]  Just don't cuss and have a good phone line.
[00:24:28.838 --> 00:24:30.200]  That's all I ask.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.802]  You agree, you disagree, you've got questions for me.
[00:24:32.802 --> 00:24:37.866]  A lot of times I think I've got some decent answers, sometimes I don't, I'll be honest with you.
[00:24:37.866 --> 00:24:41.969]  I want to take a lot of your phone calls.
[00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:43.110]  But as Darth Vader says,
[00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:46.400]  You can dispense with the pleasantries.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:46.901]  I love you.
[00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:47.441]  You love me.
[00:24:47.441 --> 00:24:48.262]  Maybe you hate me.
[00:24:48.262 --> 00:24:49.082]  Maybe I dislike you.
[00:24:49.082 --> 00:24:50.763]  We don't need to get through all that.
[00:24:50.763 --> 00:24:54.265]  Just get to the topic of what you want to cover.
[00:24:54.265 --> 00:24:56.406]  And if you disagree and want to tell me you hate me, that's fine.
[00:24:56.406 --> 00:25:03.571]  But as Limbaugh invented the term dittos, we don't want to spend the whole show thanking each other.
[00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:05.812]  That's what The Wolf says in Pulp Fiction.
[00:25:05.812 --> 00:25:07.953]  Let's not start, you know, wanting each other.
[00:25:07.953 --> 00:25:10.135]  Just yet, we've still got a ways to go.
[00:25:11.101 --> 00:25:19.586]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I've got miles to go before I sleep.
[00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:23.949]  By the way, guys, print me that poem, and will you also reprint me the Bible verse?
[00:25:23.949 --> 00:25:24.690]  I forgot to cover here.
[00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.112]  It's about a time to reap, a time to sow, a time for peace, a time for war.
[00:25:28.112 --> 00:25:30.173]  I want to read that.
[00:25:30.173 --> 00:25:35.437]  So, without further ado, let's turn on the phone system.
[00:25:35.437 --> 00:25:38.659]  Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
[00:25:39.949 --> 00:25:52.677]  And we are going to take your phone calls, a lot of them, ahead of Vivek Ramaswamy joining us in the third hour today.
[00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:54.598]  And he's always informative.
[00:25:54.598 --> 00:25:55.458]  I just love the guy.
[00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:57.660]  I mean, he's doing nothing but damage.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.182]  You say, well, he's probably not going to win or whatever.
[00:26:01.182 --> 00:26:04.244]  He's winning by getting the truth out.
[00:26:04.244 --> 00:26:06.045]  And I mean, the guy is hitting on all cylinders.
[00:26:07.051 --> 00:26:08.072]  I like him.
[00:26:08.072 --> 00:26:09.512]  I like him a lot.
[00:26:09.512 --> 00:26:17.637]  So we're going to be having Vivek Ramaswamy on for most of the third hour today.
[00:26:17.637 --> 00:26:18.717]  And then I forget, who do we have?
[00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:26.362]  Oh, the great Mike Adams is going to be on with Maria Z.
[00:26:28.052 --> 00:26:34.995]  In the fourth hour today, and then Owen Schreyer will be hosting the War Room 3 p.m.
[00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:36.175]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:26:36.175 --> 00:26:41.678]  He's in prison, the judge said in the sentencing document, for his speech.
[00:26:41.678 --> 00:26:50.521]  And he's in solitary confinement for daring to call out of the jail, which is his right, and someone recorded it and put it on Twitter, so bye-bye to you.
[00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:51.242]  It's now confirmed.
[00:26:52.443 --> 00:26:53.204]  It's because of that call.
[00:26:53.204 --> 00:26:58.348]  Just remember what they do to him, they want to do to you.
[00:26:58.348 --> 00:27:04.492]  And that's why it's so important that we remember that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:04.492 --> 00:27:10.197]  Alright, let's move into some of the other news here.
[00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:13.199]  Elon Musk has filed a big lawsuit.
[00:27:14.677 --> 00:27:30.766]  And he's got all the details in it here of why he's filed the lawsuit against Twitter, I mean against the group attacking Twitter, and now X, and that of course is our good friends over at Media Matters, the Jordan Soros anti-free speech group.
[00:27:30.766 --> 00:27:34.048]  And they're now spinning it, oh, Musk is trying to shut down their speech.
[00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:35.929]  No.
[00:27:35.929 --> 00:27:41.212]  Musk has put forward the evidence in the lawsuit that they used a computer program
[00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:58.842]  To force thousands and thousands of re-upload or refreshes of the site until they finally were able to have it posted into categories of things they can call quote white supremacist or anti-semitic.
[00:28:00.592 --> 00:28:04.235]  And then they can go to the sponsors and say, you don't want to be part of this, do you?
[00:28:04.235 --> 00:28:26.210]  Well, Musk says they're presenting the evidence, and they've been pretty accurate so far, I mean, he's not really lied yet, that they have the evidence that Media Matters faked the impressions, and not just that they used a computer program to refresh and refresh up to 5,000 times per post to try to finally get a big advertiser on there,
[00:28:27.495 --> 00:28:36.520]  But that they also, it looks like, may have faked the posts themselves, or put the content up themselves.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.861]  No, Jesse Smollett would never do something like that.
[00:28:39.861 --> 00:28:41.362]  And neither would Media Matters.
[00:28:41.362 --> 00:28:43.323]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:43.323 --> 00:28:45.964]  They would... Leftist?
[00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:47.425]  Posing as white supremacists?
[00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:49.626]  That's never happened before.
[00:28:49.626 --> 00:28:53.088]  And fish don't swim in the ocean either, and birds don't fly in the sky.
[00:28:53.088 --> 00:28:56.850]  You know, when they put the sky up, those little birdies wouldn't bump their heads.
[00:28:59.867 --> 00:29:03.009]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:07.932]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:20.361]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[00:29:20.361 --> 00:29:24.964]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[00:29:24.964 --> 00:29:26.065]  Get X2 now.
[00:29:26.065 --> 00:29:27.145]  It could be the last run ever.
[00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:28.326]  We get shut down.
[00:29:28.326 --> 00:29:29.187]  While you still can,
[00:29:30.207 --> 00:29:38.173]  At InfoWarsTore.com, research iodine deficiency and billions of people with cognitive disabilities because they don't have it.
[00:29:38.173 --> 00:29:39.294]  X2.
[00:29:39.294 --> 00:29:40.375]  X2.
[00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:43.717]  X2 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:43.717 --> 00:29:46.919]  It takes a few weeks to kick in, but it is the building block to everything.
[00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:47.640]  It's the missing link.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.163]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family but has the opposite effect.
[00:29:52.163 --> 00:29:55.866]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:57.587]  X2, back in stock right now.
[00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:58.708]  Discount at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:04.512]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[00:30:04.512 --> 00:30:14.358]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[00:30:15.219 --> 00:30:15.800]  I think so.
[00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:40.604]  Finally, after close to a year,
[00:31:03.098 --> 00:31:13.828]  In early November, where I'm cutting this ad, we finally got one of our flagship products back in stock, Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 organic.
[00:31:13.828 --> 00:31:18.733]  You take it under the tongue, so you get better absorption of the body through your blood vessels and what it does.
[00:31:19.193 --> 00:31:19.653]  We're good.
[00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:42.734]  It's available from a top lab that we private label it through at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:50.899]  Ultra 12, Vitamin B12, taken sublingually, now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:50.899 --> 00:31:53.161]  Or you can call toll free and order it as well, 888-253-3139.
[00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.662]  And Ultra 12 funds the InfoWars as well.
[00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:07.708]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:16.274]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[00:32:16.274 --> 00:32:22.638]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:33.708]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[00:32:33.708 --> 00:32:38.532]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[00:32:38.532 --> 00:32:42.235]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[00:32:42.475 --> 00:32:49.098]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[00:32:49.098 --> 00:32:55.281]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[00:32:55.281 --> 00:33:00.344]  Sell it out now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:33:00.344 --> 00:33:06.247]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.792 --> 00:33:20.113]  You want answers?
[00:33:20.113 --> 00:33:21.435]  Well, so does we.
[00:33:21.435 --> 00:33:23.777]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.323 --> 00:33:43.224]  A time to be born.
[00:33:43.224 --> 00:33:45.324]  A time to die.
[00:33:45.324 --> 00:33:47.585]  A time to plant.
[00:33:47.585 --> 00:33:51.406]  A time to reach.
[00:33:51.406 --> 00:33:55.088]  A time to kill.
[00:33:55.088 --> 00:33:57.248]  A time to heal.
[00:33:57.248 --> 00:34:01.610]  A time to ever try to be.
[00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.750]  To everything.
[00:34:06.676 --> 00:34:08.256]  Incredible universe God has given us.
[00:34:08.256 --> 00:34:09.457]  What an incredible consciousness.
[00:34:09.457 --> 00:34:10.157]  We're so thankful.
[00:34:10.157 --> 00:34:12.537]  I know I am.
[00:34:12.537 --> 00:34:24.340]  I was gonna read this, but why not just have the Byrds, I think, is the band, sing it.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:29.161]  They're trying, the globalists are trying to artificially trigger a collapse, because they know they're collapsing.
[00:34:29.161 --> 00:34:34.283]  But it won't be our downfall, it'll be their downfall, because we're here, we're standing, we're fighting back.
[00:34:34.283 --> 00:34:35.243]  Alright, I want to get
[00:34:36.598 --> 00:34:38.360]  To your phone calls, I want to give the number out.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.321]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:39.481]  877-789-Alex.
[00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:39.541]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:39.541 --> 00:34:41.583]  Wide open phones, any topic, any subject, but warning.
[00:34:41.583 --> 00:34:41.843]  Warning!
[00:34:41.843 --> 00:34:42.263]  Will Robinson.
[00:35:01.305 --> 00:35:04.088]  We're going to move quick through your calls.
[00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:05.609]  877-789-2539.
[00:35:05.609 --> 00:35:09.153]  Any subject.
[00:35:09.153 --> 00:35:18.262]  And I love how it brings in all these amazing topics we wouldn't even think to cover.
[00:35:18.262 --> 00:35:20.585]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:24.569]  Okay, before I plow back into the news and start taking your phone calls,
[00:35:26.007 --> 00:35:49.015]  It's always paradoxical and that's the Catch-22 we've been in with all the incredible expenses and deep state attacks and de-platforming and de-banking and the harassment and the infiltrators and everything we've gone through in this fight, which we're not victims, we're fighting the globalists, we knew we'd be attacked and it's been quite informative and quite educational and it's also shown people that we're telling the truth because the enemy's coming after us, plus almost everything we talk about, it comes true!
[00:35:49.015 --> 00:35:52.997]  Because almost all of it was already happening, the public just didn't know about it yet.
[00:35:57.816 --> 00:36:08.958]  And a great example of that broke in New Jersey last week that the government since the early seventies has been keeping the blood of all babies and putting it in a secret DNA database.
[00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:17.000]  Now, I broke that because of a whistleblower in 1997 out of Fort Sam Houston Medical Division in San Antonio.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.801]  And lawsuits were filed in Illinois, Texas, Minnesota back then and exposed it.
[00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:24.221]  And they just keep doing it.
[00:36:24.221 --> 00:36:26.422]  Just like they give you these poison shots that they know
[00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:34.826]  FDA documents in October 2000 said they'll cause heart attacks, blood clots, strokes, infertility.
[00:36:34.826 --> 00:36:37.008]  And then people are like, wow, it actually happened.
[00:36:37.008 --> 00:36:40.631]  They know what they're doing.
[00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.013]  And now they're spinning it.
[00:36:43.013 --> 00:36:49.518]  Oh, well, we're cracking cases of, you know, sexual assault and murder decades later because we have a database on you.
[00:36:49.518 --> 00:36:56.003]  The point is they created an illegal database in 1974 in the United States, and they store it at the United Nations.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.542]  And we broke that in 1997, and now it's just now hitting the news.
[00:37:02.542 --> 00:37:05.343]  But I'm digressing.
[00:37:05.343 --> 00:37:13.365]  It's a catch-22 here that we've not had the money to buy all the popular products, so that we don't have money to get the products, because we don't have the products.
[00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:15.986]  It's a snake eating its tail situation.
[00:37:15.986 --> 00:37:20.868]  So, in a year and a half of bankruptcy, we also couldn't get it produced.
[00:37:20.868 --> 00:37:23.629]  It wasn't just a money issue, it was both.
[00:37:23.629 --> 00:37:25.309]  Our best-selling product's been gone.
[00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.550]  X2's been sold out over a year.
[00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:29.169]  And I said, it's going to sell really good.
[00:37:29.169 --> 00:37:30.832]  We need to put everything in.
[00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:34.377]  We've got to get a lot of it.
[00:37:34.377 --> 00:37:36.962]  And it was decided to not get as much as I wanted, and that's okay.
[00:37:38.092 --> 00:37:46.916]  But God knows how long it'll take to make it again because it's really hard to make it and get it down to the level where it's so strong you got to get it to an allowable level.
[00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:53.119]  You're breaking raw crystal pure iodine that nobody else is doing with these scientists into this.
[00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:55.781]  That's why it works so well as the foundation of your whole body.
[00:37:55.781 --> 00:37:57.701]  It really is the missing link.
[00:37:57.701 --> 00:37:58.682]  Fluoride is the opposite.
[00:37:58.682 --> 00:38:02.684]  That's why they bomb you with fluoride, bromide, bromine and that whole area of the periodic table.
[00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:06.850]  So it's the good halogen, everything else is bad.
[00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:13.414]  You need a tiny bit of calcium fluoride, but the point is, almost all of it's really bad for you, other than iodine, which is essential.
[00:38:13.414 --> 00:38:16.756]  And so it's finally back in stock.
[00:38:16.756 --> 00:38:19.858]  And just research iodine deficiency, 2 billion people have it.
[00:38:19.858 --> 00:38:23.059]  The UN estimates, I say it's much higher.
[00:38:23.059 --> 00:38:31.024]  IQs, by the 20s, had dropped up to 15 points, particularly in the middle of the country, because they weren't getting, the soil was depleted, they weren't getting any fish.
[00:38:31.857 --> 00:38:32.357]  We're good to go.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:01.182]  And if we'd had a bigger order, our financial problems would be solved pretty much for the next six months, but we don't.
[00:39:01.182 --> 00:39:02.102]  So here's the problem.
[00:39:02.102 --> 00:39:09.185]  It's going to sell out in about three, four weeks of current sales rates, and it might be six months, a year, and we may not be here then.
[00:39:09.185 --> 00:39:13.847]  So this could be the last time you can get X2.
[00:39:13.847 --> 00:39:14.927]  You know it's our best seller.
[00:39:14.927 --> 00:39:16.447]  Haven't had it for over a year.
[00:39:16.447 --> 00:39:17.428]  We have X2 now.
[00:39:19.474 --> 00:39:20.635]  It lasts a long time.
[00:39:20.635 --> 00:39:22.817]  I would stockpile it if I was you.
[00:39:22.817 --> 00:39:25.420]  It's 25% off despite the fact it's selling out.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.741]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:35.309]  And we've got free shipping storewide on every order and double Patriot points at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:40.815]  Also, we have the Infowars Platinum line that are three number one U.S.
[00:39:40.815 --> 00:39:43.858]  bestsellers by a great pharmaceutical company actually makes it.
[00:39:44.611 --> 00:39:46.133]  They make so many things that are on store shelves.
[00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:48.115]  It's a huge company, but they're actually Patriots.
[00:39:48.115 --> 00:39:51.800]  Compared to big ones, it's a small pharmaceutical company, but it's a multi-billion dollar a year company.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.002]  The owner's a Patriot, so he's really helped us.
[00:39:54.002 --> 00:40:01.852]  We're able to private label his three best sellers under the new names, HGH Max Boost, 1776 Testosterone Boost, and Pain MD.
[00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:03.653]  That's available.
[00:40:03.653 --> 00:40:04.633]  Infowarshore.com.
[00:40:04.633 --> 00:40:08.254]  The HGH Max Boost is very close to selling out.
[00:40:08.254 --> 00:40:15.416]  60% off on Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, 50% off Real Red Pill Plus, Green Fiber Capsules, Down Out Sleep Support, now back in stock.
[00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:17.856]  Vazno Beats, finally back in stock, 40% off.
[00:40:17.856 --> 00:40:20.017]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:22.097]  Vitamineral Fusion, limited supply, 40% off.
[00:40:22.097 --> 00:40:25.078]  DNA Force Plus, about to sell out, still 40% off.
[00:40:25.078 --> 00:40:27.178]  D3 Gummies, so important for your immune system and more.
[00:40:27.578 --> 00:40:28.298]  We're good to go.
[00:40:55.464 --> 00:41:01.047]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:01.047 --> 00:41:02.728]  And I'm done talking about that.
[00:41:02.728 --> 00:41:05.629]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:10.392]  But believe me, you want X2, it takes two weeks to trigger on average.
[00:41:10.392 --> 00:41:11.872]  I was told this by the scientists that developed it.
[00:41:11.872 --> 00:41:12.733]  I'm like, yeah, right.
[00:41:12.733 --> 00:41:16.495]  They said those sunspots on your faces ten years ago will go away.
[00:41:16.495 --> 00:41:18.096]  You'll have incredible libido.
[00:41:18.096 --> 00:41:20.297]  If it takes two weeks on average to hit, you'll kind of feel
[00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:27.144]  Like you're detoxing or sick in about two to three weeks for a couple days, and then you'll just feel this incredible burst of energy.
[00:41:27.144 --> 00:41:36.672]  And it was, I liken it to when my children were little, there's a place called Mount Bedell in Austin that's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of steps up to the top.
[00:41:36.672 --> 00:41:48.363]  And if you've ever put your child on your shoulders and gone up something like that, when you take them off your shoulders, and I'm still carrying my kids on my shoulders when they were 60 pounds,
[00:41:49.952 --> 00:41:51.032]  It feels like you're flying.
[00:42:08.228 --> 00:42:11.710]  I just woke up one day for the best sleep of my life and was just like, whoa.
[00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:14.311]  And then the sunspots went away.
[00:42:14.311 --> 00:42:15.351]  And I had big ones.
[00:42:15.351 --> 00:42:16.632]  Look at my face before 10 years ago.
[00:42:16.632 --> 00:42:18.773]  Boop, boop, boop, you know, like liver spots.
[00:42:18.773 --> 00:42:19.473]  They just went away.
[00:42:19.473 --> 00:42:21.354]  And I was like, what?
[00:42:21.354 --> 00:42:24.095]  And then I was like, all of a sudden, like raging.
[00:42:24.095 --> 00:42:25.896]  And it's a family show, but let's just be serious.
[00:42:25.896 --> 00:42:27.257]  I mean, raging.
[00:42:28.675 --> 00:42:31.156]  Morning Wood.
[00:42:31.156 --> 00:42:33.277]  Just like, whoa!
[00:42:33.277 --> 00:42:36.039]  Not since I was 18 did it, you know, hurt.
[00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:37.359]  I'm trying to be graphic here, but it's real.
[00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:41.081]  I mean, I'm just telling you, like, you know, you get an erection so strong, it hurts.
[00:42:41.081 --> 00:42:45.283]  Like, ah!
[00:42:45.283 --> 00:42:47.725]  And look, it affects different people differently.
[00:42:47.725 --> 00:42:52.307]  But if you're really deficient and take it, you're going to probably really feel bad when it kicks in for a while.
[00:42:52.307 --> 00:42:53.668]  So talk to your physician.
[00:42:53.668 --> 00:42:54.908]  This isn't a game.
[00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:55.629]  Just try it.
[00:42:55.629 --> 00:42:56.309]  You'll be hooked.
[00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:57.610]  It's amazing.
[00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.110]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.634 --> 00:43:05.838]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:43:05.838 --> 00:43:10.521]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:14.903]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:43:16.324 --> 00:43:19.388]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:20.950]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:26.897]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:43:26.897 --> 00:43:32.944]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:35.707]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:38.790]  I don't know.
[00:44:00.325 --> 00:44:03.447]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:44:03.447 --> 00:44:05.749]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:44:05.749 --> 00:44:09.692]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:44:09.692 --> 00:44:18.618]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:44:18.618 --> 00:44:26.404]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:44:27.435 --> 00:44:31.037]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:44:31.037 --> 00:44:36.859]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:44:36.859 --> 00:44:39.320]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:39.880]  Keep doing it.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:46.943]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:44:46.943 --> 00:44:48.124]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:44:48.804 --> 00:44:53.130]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Enforcewear.com.
[00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:58.076]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforcewear.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:44:58.076 --> 00:44:58.837]  Please take action now.
[00:45:03.703 --> 00:45:05.964]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:45:05.964 --> 00:45:12.265]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:45:12.265 --> 00:45:15.646]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:19.647]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:45:19.647 --> 00:45:22.268]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well.
[00:45:22.848 --> 00:45:29.152]  Take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[00:45:29.152 --> 00:45:36.857]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:45:36.857 --> 00:45:42.980]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.701]  All right, we love you.
[00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:44.281]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:49.164]  Get your Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Carbo Force at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:50.425]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:45:59.113 --> 00:46:04.561]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:14.415]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[00:46:15.256 --> 00:46:15.916]  I'm good.
[00:46:38.943 --> 00:46:42.805]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:12.005]  We're good to go.
[00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:37.561]  Alright, look, we got loaded phone lines.
[00:47:37.561 --> 00:47:45.447]  We're gonna go to Lee, Paul, Patriot, Evan, Joe, Kathy, Gary, Steve, Russell, Robert, you name it.
[00:47:45.447 --> 00:47:48.269]  And I'm just gonna start taking one call after the next for the next
[00:47:49.677 --> 00:47:51.399]  We're good to go.
[00:48:17.082 --> 00:48:19.103]  And they're almost in control of the planet.
[00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:22.106]  That's why my predictions come true.
[00:48:22.106 --> 00:48:24.127]  Because it's their architecture plans.
[00:48:24.127 --> 00:48:25.908]  It's their game plan.
[00:48:25.908 --> 00:48:28.250]  It's their battle plan.
[00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.571]  And it's like they're painting by numbers.
[00:48:30.734 --> 00:48:36.598]  And so we can try to resist them and we back them off and we fight, but we tend to fight one issue and then go away.
[00:48:36.598 --> 00:48:37.618]  And then fight another issue.
[00:48:37.618 --> 00:48:37.978]  No.
[00:48:37.978 --> 00:48:42.741]  You fight the globalists and their whole program and realize they're the ones getting full control.
[00:48:42.741 --> 00:48:49.025]  They're the bad guys bringing in world government, bringing in capitalist society, attacking the family, getting rid of the borders, starting all the wars.
[00:48:49.025 --> 00:48:50.026]  And then it's game over.
[00:48:50.026 --> 00:48:52.087]  You kill the hydra itself.
[00:48:52.087 --> 00:48:54.889]  You stab it in the heart politically, not violently.
[00:48:54.889 --> 00:48:56.049]  You don't just sit there and fight.
[00:48:56.049 --> 00:48:58.111]  It's different heads that are coming at you.
[00:48:58.111 --> 00:49:00.132]  So here's that report and we're going right to your phone calls.
[00:49:08.237 --> 00:49:12.420]  We're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.442]  What's being said on social media platforms.
[00:49:15.442 --> 00:49:27.069]  We have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms.
[00:49:27.569 --> 00:49:39.232]  This governor of New York statement about how they're going to surveil everyone and then thought crime you is a big deal because they've already been doing this but now the ADL that runs this lady wants it codified into law.
[00:49:39.232 --> 00:49:43.233]  You've seen the EU say recently, oh don't worry soon we'll be censoring Americans.
[00:49:43.233 --> 00:49:45.434]  The EU threatening to arrest Elon Musk.
[00:49:45.434 --> 00:49:46.234]  This is a big deal.
[00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:48.475]  Governor Kathy Hochul says New York...
[00:49:49.999 --> 00:49:55.564]  Now conducting special media surveillance efforts to monitor hate.
[00:49:55.564 --> 00:49:58.065]  That's government taxpayer money to monitor what you say.
[00:49:58.065 --> 00:50:01.128]  And I always point this out about the censorship.
[00:50:01.128 --> 00:50:03.410]  It's surveillance and censorship.
[00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:07.773]  And the surveillance is just as bad as the censorship itself.
[00:50:07.773 --> 00:50:13.818]  None Dare Call It Conspiracy and many, many others like Cleon Skousen's The Naked Communist.
[00:50:13.818 --> 00:50:19.262]  And then reading the New American Magazine predicting what the world government would look like from their own documents.
[00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:20.002]  We're good to go.
[00:50:40.529 --> 00:50:56.059]  Julian Huxley, who was the head of the World Eugenics Society and later the first transhumanist, saying in the 50s, we're going to end the sexes, break up the families, and turn humans into factory farm produced creatures that we control.
[00:50:56.059 --> 00:51:06.145]  So that you have more and more people living their lives out as subordinates in these hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracies, either
[00:51:06.872 --> 00:51:11.773]  The bureaucracy is a big business, or the bureaucracy is a big government.
[00:51:11.773 --> 00:51:23.156]  Now, the devices that you were talking about, are there specific devices or methods of communication which diminish our freedoms in addition to overpopulation and overorganization?
[00:51:23.156 --> 00:51:26.177]  Well, there are certainly devices which can be used in this way.
[00:51:26.177 --> 00:51:31.858]  I mean, let us take, after all, a piece of very recent and very painful history.
[00:51:33.417 --> 00:51:33.977]  I think so.
[00:51:56.525 --> 00:52:00.689]  And Huxley wrote in Radio World Revisited 1961 that this was the actual plan of the technocrats.
[00:52:00.689 --> 00:52:05.314]  So see, I knew that the founding scientist of the UN
[00:52:19.429 --> 00:52:24.092]  And his brother had told her by the battle plan and then explained, this is not a joke.
[00:52:24.092 --> 00:52:29.176]  And then I went and looked at what they were planning in the 50s that was done by the 70s.
[00:52:29.176 --> 00:52:31.958]  What they were planning in the 70s was done by the 90s.
[00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:44.746]  And I said, well, if we continue down the trajectory, what they're saying they'll have done by the year 2000, Agenda 2021, then they're going to do Agenda 2030, which is 90% foresty population.
[00:52:44.746 --> 00:52:47.348]  That's going to get really nasty, isn't it?
[00:52:48.169 --> 00:52:52.130]  It is the inventory and control plan.
[00:52:52.130 --> 00:53:09.075]  Inventory and control of all land, all water, all minerals, all plants, all animals, all construction, all means of production, all food, all energy, all information, and all human beings in the world.
[00:53:10.275 --> 00:53:16.261]  And this is a plan that was agreed to by 179 nations back in 1992.
[00:53:16.261 --> 00:53:18.423]  It's a United Nations plan.
[00:53:18.423 --> 00:53:21.045]  It's called the Agenda for the 21st Century.
[00:53:21.045 --> 00:53:23.708]  And so they are attempting it.
[00:53:23.708 --> 00:53:28.332]  That's the whole point of the broadcast is we know the enemy plan.
[00:53:28.332 --> 00:53:29.373]  We know their operation.
[00:53:30.737 --> 00:53:36.719]  Now we know the trajectory only goes down until we start not complying and then building alternate systems.
[00:53:36.719 --> 00:53:39.840]  Society goes up and down in cycles.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:48.082]  And the globalists know that and now they want a final cycle with an organized scientific takeover of civilization so it's the end of history, the end of cycles.
[00:53:51.289 --> 00:53:53.490]  Very important report.
[00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:55.592]  It's on InfoWars.com and Bandai Video.
[00:53:55.592 --> 00:53:58.533]  We are dying in the Huxley Eugenics nightmare.
[00:53:58.533 --> 00:53:59.394]  This is a fact.
[00:53:59.394 --> 00:54:00.655]  This is the real world.
[00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:02.096]  This is what they're doing.
[00:54:02.096 --> 00:54:03.096]  So let's learn about it.
[00:54:03.096 --> 00:54:05.418]  Let's get informed about it and just face it.
[00:54:05.418 --> 00:54:07.899]  Because they'll talk academically how they're doing it and roll it out.
[00:54:07.899 --> 00:54:14.403]  And then when you say, I don't want that, they have the ADL and ABC News and everybody else come out and say you're a terrorist.
[00:54:14.403 --> 00:54:15.364]  No, they're saying it.
[00:54:15.364 --> 00:54:16.044]  They're doing it.
[00:54:16.044 --> 00:54:17.045]  It's happening.
[00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:20.707]  They just killed 20 million of us to see if they could give us a poison shot and get away with it.
[00:54:21.227 --> 00:54:25.830]  And they've not been getting away with it so far in the public arena, but they have criminally gotten away with it.
[00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.972]  They've not been put in prison for what they've done.
[00:54:28.972 --> 00:54:39.359]  Now, two-plus years ago, we came out with an emergency report, SPARS 2025-2028, three-hour program, got like 5 million, 4 million views on Bandai Video.
[00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.161]  Needs to keep going viral.
[00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:45.684]  And it's the battle plan written two years before they released COVID in 2000.
[00:54:45.684 --> 00:54:47.185]  It's not really set in the year.
[00:54:49.729 --> 00:54:50.470]  Or 2020.
[00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.831]  It's not really set in the year 2025, 2028.
[00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:56.474]  It's set in the year 2020, 2023.
[00:54:56.474 --> 00:55:01.097]  And they have tweets, and there's an example that are the exact tweets.
[00:55:01.097 --> 00:55:05.600]  They just changed the dates and the acronyms around that they then ran years later.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.864]  So it's a battle plan, but again, you can't have a battle plan to release a bioweapon and then give poison shots.
[00:55:10.864 --> 00:55:12.285]  You'll go to prison if you get caught.
[00:55:12.285 --> 00:55:13.766]  So they put it in a drill.
[00:55:14.824 --> 00:55:15.465]  There it is.
[00:55:15.465 --> 00:55:21.950]  Emergency Saturday Broadcast World Shocked by Spire 2025-2028 document.
[00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:27.095]  And the reason I raise that is this article right here.
[00:55:27.095 --> 00:55:29.357]  And you see this everywhere.
[00:55:29.357 --> 00:55:33.721]  And they said, you know, Year 3 and 4 they would do this.
[00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:38.045]  New York Times makes damning admission about school closures during COVID.
[00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:48.113]  They admit that the mask didn't work, that it made kids depressed, that it caused suicide, that it retarded their development years, and that it was a horrible thing to do.
[00:55:48.113 --> 00:55:56.905]  In the sparse document they say, starting in year three and after, we'll admit we were wrong, but we'll say it was an accident.
[00:55:58.663 --> 00:56:01.764]  So they war game psychologically how all this would go.
[00:56:01.764 --> 00:56:06.566]  They didn't war game though that you'd figure out their war plan and understand that was stage two.
[00:56:06.566 --> 00:56:09.987]  So they were going to make you think, oh we're sorry everybody's infertile now.
[00:56:09.987 --> 00:56:11.288]  We're sorry everybody's sterilized.
[00:56:11.288 --> 00:56:13.308]  Your governments did that.
[00:56:13.308 --> 00:56:25.333]  That will discredit the governments further and then the big four pharma companies, J&J, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, well they'll basically skate free.
[00:56:26.354 --> 00:56:30.516]  Maybe their CEOs will resign, but it's an accident.
[00:56:30.516 --> 00:56:38.499]  But it'll be blamed on government to then create more civil unrest that government incompetently did this.
[00:56:38.499 --> 00:56:46.063]  And then there's liability protection given to the big pharma, where then when they have losses, the governments then pay for their losses.
[00:56:47.742 --> 00:56:50.883]  This was a weaponized attack program.
[00:56:50.883 --> 00:56:53.104]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:56:53.104 --> 00:56:56.305]  Lee is first, then Paul, then Patriot.
[00:56:56.305 --> 00:56:59.305]  I'm going right in the order they are received.
[00:56:59.305 --> 00:57:00.606]  So get ready.
[00:57:00.606 --> 00:57:01.906]  We're going to break.
[00:57:01.906 --> 00:57:03.787]  But this is life and death information.
[00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.447]  This is the enemy battle plan.
[00:57:05.447 --> 00:57:05.968]  We have it.
[00:57:05.968 --> 00:57:08.408]  We can stop them if we act like adults.
[00:57:08.408 --> 00:57:09.489]  The public's not even stupid.
[00:57:09.489 --> 00:57:10.289]  They're in a trance.
[00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:11.409]  They're distracted.
[00:57:11.409 --> 00:57:15.750]  The average man knows all the college and NFL football scores.
[00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:17.011]  They think it's manly and cool.
[00:57:17.011 --> 00:57:17.371]  They know it.
[00:57:19.113 --> 00:57:21.935]  But if you know about politics, that's, like, weird, you know?
[00:57:21.935 --> 00:57:26.678]  It's like an idiocracy, when the guy knows how to do basic math, they go, oh, that's gay, or whatever, you know?
[00:57:26.678 --> 00:57:29.100]  Oh, he reads a book, look, he's a fag, you know?
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.742]  I mean, no, no, you need to know how the world works.
[00:57:31.742 --> 00:57:33.043]  This is the real war.
[00:57:33.043 --> 00:57:35.985]  This is the real thing, and we're dialed in, you're dialed in.

[00:58:26.215 --> 00:58:27.756]  Black Friday's come early.

[00:58:49.411 --> 00:58:52.614]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:58:53.925 --> 00:58:59.107]  Where were you when the globals were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:58:59.107 --> 00:59:02.548]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:59:02.548 --> 00:59:03.629]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:59:03.629 --> 00:59:08.110]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:13.973]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:59:14.713 --> 00:59:14.953]  Yeah.
[00:59:30.194 --> 00:59:32.656]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:09.227]  It's epic in this time of great censorship and tyranny to still be on air.
[01:00:09.227 --> 01:00:13.871]  And what the audience has done as activists in the arena, keeping us on air, is epic.
[01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:18.796]  So I give Thanksgiving to you, a few days after Thanksgiving, my friends.
[01:00:18.796 --> 01:00:20.758]  We're showing some beautiful art.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.641]  It's pulled from the human subconscious by AI.
[01:00:26.641 --> 01:00:32.782]  AI aggregates millions of people's thoughts and dreams, shows us a reflection of ourself, and we think AI made it.
[01:00:32.782 --> 01:00:35.903]  No, that is the human subconscious.
[01:00:35.903 --> 01:00:41.825]  And finally, I've seen what I dream about every night, but even more intense and more powerful.
[01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:45.906]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Lee in the middle of the USA.
[01:00:45.906 --> 01:00:46.666]  Lee, you're on the air.
[01:00:46.666 --> 01:00:47.186]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:49.881]  Hey, thanks Alex for taking my call.
[01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:51.342]  It's an honor and privilege to talk to you.
[01:00:51.342 --> 01:00:52.422]  Same to you.
[01:00:52.422 --> 01:00:58.863]  What I'd like to talk about is the 40 informants that the FBI had on the Bidens.
[01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:03.364]  I don't think you guys are really focusing enough on that and I think there's a lot of juicy stuff to read there.
[01:01:03.364 --> 01:01:03.804]  You're right.
[01:01:03.804 --> 01:01:07.885]  I meant to play the Fox News pieces on that.
[01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:10.346]  That's incredible because they're all part of it getting the money too.
[01:01:12.225 --> 01:01:13.746]  Well, yeah, they are, but here's the thing.
[01:01:13.746 --> 01:01:15.667]  They were keeping an eye on the Bidens for years.
[01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:28.295]  Now, the Bidens had these documents in multiple places, too, and include Joe Biden's home, the Penn Biden Center, and then also a place in Chinatown, Baltimore, I believe it was, but don't quote me on that.
[01:01:28.295 --> 01:01:38.121]  And I want to know what they had to say, because if you connect all of these dots, I have a feeling you're going to find out that Hunter Biden was committing treason and espionage against the United States.
[01:01:38.701 --> 01:01:43.666]  Well no, he's on audio recordings on his laptop saying I work for the head of Chinese intelligence.
[01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.627]  Exactly!
[01:01:44.627 --> 01:01:47.329]  And it's all right out there.
[01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:55.957]  He partied in multiple cities, or did business in multiple cities with Yijian Ming and Hou Chi-Ping of the CEFC.
[01:01:55.957 --> 01:01:59.660]  Both of them are Chinese intelligence agents.
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.283]  One of them is a billionaire, and they live that billionaire lifestyle.
[01:02:03.968 --> 01:02:07.410]  I want to know what they found, and why did the FBI cover it up?
[01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:14.314]  Chuck Grassley's claiming that they, these informants, reported on crimes that the Bidens were committing.
[01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.715]  And it was all hidden.
[01:02:15.715 --> 01:02:17.356]  Yeah, they're above the law.
[01:02:17.356 --> 01:02:22.739]  Trump's being indicted for a crooked toenail, and then Hunter Biden's just running around.
[01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:26.462]  But they put him there because he's compromised.
[01:02:26.462 --> 01:02:28.063]  Because he'll do whatever they tell him.
[01:02:28.063 --> 01:02:30.144]  That's the reason Biden was put there.
[01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:40.866]  Yeah, Hunter's busy running around all these different court cases, but he's also dropping off cocaine next to the Situation Room, just in case.
[01:02:40.866 --> 01:02:44.670]  And these things are just so obnoxiously obvious, Alex.
[01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.934]  Yeah, they're a bunch of pedophile, drug addict, complete maniacs.
[01:02:48.675 --> 01:02:49.976]  And why are, why are, why are,
[01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:12.973]  Our elected officials are not reigning in this government agency.
[01:03:12.973 --> 01:03:18.434]  Because they're insider trading and they're on the CHICOM funding tit as well.
[01:03:18.434 --> 01:03:21.935]  I mean, look, look at Mitch McConnell's wife, a CHICOM agent.
[01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:26.116]  And so that's why they're not doing it because they're part of it.
[01:03:26.116 --> 01:03:29.577]  It's obnoxious and there needs to be some accountability in D.C.
[01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:32.158]  because it's just it's all you have to do is connect the dots.
[01:03:32.964 --> 01:03:36.965]  It's so simple, and if a kid sitting in the middle of nowhere can figure it out.
[01:03:36.965 --> 01:03:40.605]  Yeah, we have a two-layer justice system.
[01:03:40.605 --> 01:03:46.286]  Like, they're not going to charge Biden for his house and a storage shed, which he got as vice president.
[01:03:46.286 --> 01:03:47.887]  It's illegal for him to have it.
[01:03:47.887 --> 01:03:49.927]  Trump, it's legal to have secret documents.
[01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:53.968]  And the feds are not going to indict Biden for it.
[01:03:53.968 --> 01:04:01.349]  Of course they're not, because they're all part of selling out America, and they've done a great job of it.
[01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:02.109]  It's very, very sad.
[01:04:03.146 --> 01:04:05.668]  Well, Joe Biden should have never been on the ballot to begin with.
[01:04:05.668 --> 01:04:08.911]  You know, Hunter was caught pre-election stealing from a military.
[01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:16.557]  Wait a minute, are you saying the Bidens didn't win?
[01:04:16.557 --> 01:04:18.419]  Should have never been on the ballot to begin with.
[01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:19.359]  It's all a fraud, brother.
[01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.220]  Appreciate your call.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.601]  All right, that's one call out of the way.
[01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:22.882]  Great call.
[01:04:22.882 --> 01:04:27.546]  We're going to break for one minute to join some stations, and I'm going to go right to your calls, Paul and everybody else.
[01:04:27.546 --> 01:04:29.488]  So get ready.
[01:04:29.488 --> 01:04:30.028]  But yeah,
[01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:33.634]  You know, the caller's like, why don't you spend more time with the Bidens?
[01:04:33.634 --> 01:04:35.035]  It's known.
[01:04:35.035 --> 01:04:35.975]  It's there.
[01:04:35.975 --> 01:04:37.296]  Everybody knows.
[01:04:37.296 --> 01:04:38.437]  The laptop was real.
[01:04:38.437 --> 01:04:38.897]  All of it.
[01:04:38.897 --> 01:04:40.638]  Yeah, Biden's a sellout.
[01:04:40.638 --> 01:04:42.339]  Anybody will give him money.
[01:04:42.339 --> 01:04:45.981]  I mean, there's new videos of him groping kids and hitting on six-year-olds.
[01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:47.302]  I mean, yeah, he's a traitor.
[01:04:47.302 --> 01:04:48.622]  He's a piece of garbage.
[01:04:48.622 --> 01:04:51.604]  That's who the globalists chose for this moment.
[01:04:51.604 --> 01:04:53.865]  Because he'll take all the blame for what they're actually doing.
[01:04:53.865 --> 01:04:54.346]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.346 --> 01:04:54.686]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.652 --> 01:05:03.794]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[01:05:03.794 --> 01:05:09.238]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:21.146]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:25.749]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.

[01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:27.950]  It could be the last run ever.

[01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:13.565]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:14.865]  Get your motor running.
[01:06:14.865 --> 01:06:19.506]  Get out on the highway.
[01:06:19.506 --> 01:06:20.966]  Looking for adventure.
[01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:22.987]  And whatever comes our way.
[01:06:22.987 --> 01:06:23.507]  Woo!
[01:06:37.941 --> 01:07:00.023]  You know I've told you a lot of years that I have dreams all the time of stuff that I've never seen in popular culture or media and now they've released a bunch of AI that's trolling the human subconscious and it's basically what I've seen pretty amazing but even more spectacular but still freaking me out
[01:07:01.064 --> 01:07:02.766]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[01:07:02.766 --> 01:07:03.667]  Hell, just keep rolling it.
[01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:05.949]  This is better looking than my ugly face.
[01:07:05.949 --> 01:07:08.571]  Let's go to Paul in Rhode Island.
[01:07:08.571 --> 01:07:09.392]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:11.354]  Go ahead.
[01:07:11.354 --> 01:07:12.695]  Hey, Alex, it's Paul.
[01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.377]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:14.377 --> 01:07:16.959]  Hey, Alex, long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:07:16.959 --> 01:07:23.606]  I've been listening to you since the early 2000s when I was living in New York and handing out CD-ROMs and 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:07:24.048 --> 01:07:25.648]  And it's great to be on your show.
[01:07:25.648 --> 01:07:27.089]  I'm with you all the way.
[01:07:27.089 --> 01:07:36.672]  There's one subject I want to talk about that I believe I have some specific knowledge that could be a great help to you and all the rest of the listeners, and that is the science of food combining.
[01:07:36.672 --> 01:07:40.253]  It comes from the Bible when Moses came down from the mountain.
[01:07:40.253 --> 01:07:48.975]  One of the things he says in Leviticus is that the people of Israel should eat their breads and cereals in the morning and their animal flesh at night, meaning that to have
[01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:55.819]  The best health we possibly can, we should not eat animal flesh and carbohydrates in the same meal.
[01:07:55.819 --> 01:08:01.601]  We can eat as much meat as we want, we can eat as much bread as we want, but we've got to separate them into different meals.
[01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:10.044]  And also, fruits should be eaten alone, and as much fat as you want can be eaten with carbohydrates.
[01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:13.505]  And I incorporated this into my life, and within 30 days I lost 30 pounds.
[01:08:14.426 --> 01:08:17.948]  I wasn't exercising, and I was eating as much as I possibly could.
[01:08:17.948 --> 01:08:22.269]  Yeah, the 600-whatever-laws in Leviticus, I've looked at them, they all make sense, yeah.
[01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:23.850]  Yeah, it was incredible.
[01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.511]  I lost 35 pounds in one month.
[01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:30.013]  You can eat as much as you want, you just, you can't eat eggs and toast.
[01:08:30.013 --> 01:08:33.995]  You gotta eat, like, eggs and avocado, or just eggs and as much bacon as you can.
[01:08:33.995 --> 01:08:39.357]  When you have a steak, you can't have a white potato, you gotta eat it with a sweet potato or as much vegetables as you can.
[01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:41.556]  That's just one thing I wanted to share.
[01:08:41.556 --> 01:08:45.417]  You can find all the information in the Tao of Health.
[01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:46.778]  I appreciate that.
[01:08:46.778 --> 01:08:47.578]  Thanks for the call, buddy.
[01:08:47.578 --> 01:08:48.618]  I appreciate it.
[01:08:48.618 --> 01:08:50.279]  Let's go to Patriot in Ohio.
[01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:50.839]  You're on the air.
[01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:52.400]  Welcome.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.300]  Yes.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.201]  Mr. Jones, man of nose.
[01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:56.485]  At all.
[01:08:56.485 --> 01:08:57.346]  Good to speak with you.
[01:08:57.346 --> 01:08:59.047]  I don't know about knowing at all.
[01:08:59.047 --> 01:09:01.669]  I know that I know nothing, as Socrates said.
[01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:04.951]  It's Patriot Rep, R-E-P, by the way, but that's okay.
[01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:07.593]  Well, I'm sorry I got it wrong.
[01:09:07.593 --> 01:09:09.194]  What's your call sign?
[01:09:09.194 --> 01:09:11.015]  Let's slow down and get it right here.
[01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:12.236]  We're here doing this.
[01:09:12.236 --> 01:09:13.477]  What's your proper call sign?
[01:09:13.477 --> 01:09:14.237]  Hold on just a second.
[01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:16.038]  Let's just slow down here.
[01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:18.400]  What's your proper... Hold on.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.962]  Just have a ten second pause.
[01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:22.583]  Just have a ten second pause here.
[01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:23.783]  Serenity.
[01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:24.404]  Everything's great.
[01:09:25.558 --> 01:09:27.759]  My pet peeves get the names of the callers right.
[01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:30.179]  What is your call sign again?
[01:09:30.179 --> 01:09:31.760]  Patriot Rep.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.660]  Okay, go ahead now.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.561]  Yeah, I've been a long time supporter of you, Alex.
[01:09:35.561 --> 01:09:42.743]  You know, like I said, we spoke before and I got your links directly on my campaign site at PatriotRep.com.
[01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:47.344]  But I want to thank you and InfoWars and everybody out there for everything you do.
[01:09:47.344 --> 01:09:48.604]  I'm praying for Owen.
[01:09:48.604 --> 01:09:55.166]  But what I wanted to ask you was, did you see the Pete Santilli thing this morning?
[01:09:56.495 --> 01:09:58.135]  Uh, that he put up.
[01:09:58.135 --> 01:09:59.076]  Did you see that?
[01:09:59.076 --> 01:09:59.656]  No, I didn't.
[01:09:59.656 --> 01:10:01.116]  So, what is it?
[01:10:01.116 --> 01:10:06.077]  It's a federal judge rule to prosecute the deep state.
[01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:12.338]  Um, so, I mean, it goes all the way back to the Oklahoma City bombing and carry on forth.
[01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:20.000]  And some names were mentioned, some weren't, because there were still some sealed documents that he's going to release or he's going to expose.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.220]  But yeah, it's very, very interesting, man.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:22.901]  That's amazing.
[01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:23.941]  So, who's the federal judge?
[01:10:23.941 --> 01:10:24.401]  What's going on?
[01:10:26.898 --> 01:10:34.404]  I don't remember the Federal Judge's name, but you can go right to Pete Santilli on Rumble.
[01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:34.885]  It's 3830.
[01:10:34.885 --> 01:10:36.966]  It was 8 o'clock this morning.
[01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.408]  He broke it all.
[01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:39.329]  I'll look into that.
[01:10:39.329 --> 01:10:41.110]  What else is on your mind?
[01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:45.274]  Oh man, I just wish that people would support you more.
[01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.775]  I know that because you are, we are,
[01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:49.189]  This is Evan the Evangelist.
[01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:51.151]  I've had the pleasure of speaking with you before.
[01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:19.217]  I want to point out that in the Bible, 1 Timothy 6.10, it says that the love of money is the root of either all evil or all kinds of evil.
[01:11:19.217 --> 01:11:25.324]  I notice that the deep state, what they promote is the love of money, because by doing that,
[01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:29.303]  They take the power away from the people to do good things.
[01:11:29.303 --> 01:11:29.824]  That's right.
[01:11:29.824 --> 01:11:33.806]  Money is only a symbol of energy, and it's supposed to be a mode of exchange.
[01:11:33.806 --> 01:11:38.428]  But they have unlimited through fiat, so they can literally buy anybody that doesn't have morals.
[01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:41.410]  But if you have morals, then their money's worth nothing.
[01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:46.933]  And that's why they want the cashless society, it's why they want the ESG, the central bank digital currency, the social credit score.
[01:11:46.933 --> 01:11:50.895]  Because once they have that, man, we're in deep trouble.
[01:11:50.895 --> 01:11:51.555]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.555 --> 01:11:56.338]  I noticed when Andrew Tate was the number one Bugatti salesman on planet Earth, promoting
[01:11:57.406 --> 01:11:58.766]  He was the most Googled man.
[01:11:58.766 --> 01:12:04.527]  Well, he's no longer the most Googled man because they just changed the algorithm because he started to do good things.
[01:12:04.527 --> 01:12:15.809]  And I want to point out that there's one or two or three big fat cat listeners listening right now that could pledge enough money to you single-handedly that you would be bankrolled.
[01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.590]  You're not a Bugatti collector.
[01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:19.210]  You're a guy doing good work.
[01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:24.811]  I think people out there should realize that when God gives you wealth, it's to use it for good.
[01:12:25.296 --> 01:12:31.918]  And then you're empowering the whole, you know, love of God with actually how you spend your money.
[01:12:31.918 --> 01:12:43.362]  And you know, I'm an evangelist, so this is obvious that I would be thinking this, but people have to realize that I've noticed this over years, that the AI and the deep state, they promote people that love money.
[01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:44.803]  I call it the Max Keiser effect.
[01:12:46.007 --> 01:12:48.529]  Just say, hey, look, I collect money, I collect money.
[01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:55.614]  Well, that gets other people to want to collect money, where we should be bragging about what we're able to do with our money.
[01:12:55.614 --> 01:12:58.776]  And we should be pledging, really, to InfoWars.
[01:12:58.776 --> 01:13:00.897]  I want to throw in that X2.
[01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:06.681]  When I started taking X2 iodine, following your lead, it lowered my blood pressure, made me a healthier guy.
[01:13:06.681 --> 01:13:12.645]  So even though your products are world-class, I think there should be some fat cats really pledging to InfoWars.
[01:13:14.039 --> 01:13:18.322]  And doing good work, and I think you'd be more effective if they did that.
[01:13:18.322 --> 01:13:18.822]  Absolutely.
[01:13:18.822 --> 01:13:19.322]  God bless you.
[01:13:19.322 --> 01:13:20.743]  I appreciate your support, brother.
[01:13:20.743 --> 01:13:23.365]  Let's go to Florida and talk to Joe in Florida.
[01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:25.126]  Joe, welcome.
[01:13:25.126 --> 01:13:26.267]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[01:13:26.267 --> 01:13:43.017]  This is Joe Bender from Florida on X. I just would like Ramaswamy, when he comes on, to address however he would like to the issue of, you know, I saw these reports that he had his company, Genavant,
[01:13:43.567 --> 01:13:48.550]  Worked on the lipid nanoparticles used in the Pfizer and Moderna shots.
[01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:53.073]  And I haven't heard any, I've never heard him address anything to do with the vaccines.
[01:13:53.073 --> 01:14:00.378]  So I would just like, you know, if he's listening now or if you could ask him when he comes on to comment on that, you know, kind of
[01:14:02.029 --> 01:14:06.850]  No, that's a great question, and let me just, in honesty, explain this.
[01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:14.192]  I interviewed him yesterday, and then we added a bunch of clips and made it like an hour-long documentary, so it's not going to be live next to how I interviewed him last night.
[01:14:14.192 --> 01:14:20.934]  But next time he's on, he admits he was a nanotech company, a biotech company, that's what they were investing in.
[01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.175]  I mean, I think he's not hidden from the fact that
[01:14:24.255 --> 01:14:26.216]  That he's been part of all that.
[01:14:26.216 --> 01:14:27.417]  Definitely a very smart guy.
[01:14:27.417 --> 01:14:30.759]  And he's, you know, come out against the four shots in the lockdowns and all of it.
[01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:38.143]  But I promise you, don't let me forget, Crew, next time he's on, maybe in the studio in a few weeks, I will bring up that.
[01:14:38.143 --> 01:14:38.883]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:14:38.883 --> 01:14:39.344]  I appreciate it.
[01:14:39.344 --> 01:14:40.184]  Anything else?
[01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.605]  Great work.
[01:14:41.605 --> 01:14:52.351]  Well, you know, a while back, it was, this was actually like the first time I talked to you, maybe a couple years ago now, but I mentioned space theory about the
[01:14:53.123 --> 01:15:06.608]  Black holes not existing and everything being, like the planets being connected to the sun, being connected to the galaxies and all the galaxies are connected via these, all these things are connected via these things called Birkeland's currents of electricity.
[01:15:06.608 --> 01:15:07.348]  You can look into that.
[01:15:07.348 --> 01:15:09.269]  I remember your call.
[01:15:09.269 --> 01:15:12.590]  And you asked, you know, where do you think the energy is coming from?
[01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:14.730]  And I kind of said, well, it's like a chicken and an egg thing.
[01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:15.931]  I didn't have a really good answer for you.
[01:15:15.931 --> 01:15:19.092]  And I think a good way to think of it is that it's coming from God.
[01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:28.103]  Well, we know with the dark matter scans, it's five times more powerful outside of us, a higher dimension bleeding in.
[01:15:28.103 --> 01:15:33.464]  Well, the thing is about dark matter is it's like a duct tape for bad theory.
[01:15:33.464 --> 01:15:36.005]  It's kind of like you can fill in the blank.
[01:15:36.005 --> 01:15:38.266]  Yeah, no, they don't know what it is, so they call it dark matter.
[01:15:38.266 --> 01:15:40.146]  I totally agree.
[01:15:40.146 --> 01:15:45.447]  So there's the Sun recently, theory about that.
[01:15:45.447 --> 01:15:47.288]  They've added that to patch in
[01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.754]  You know, how does the surface of the sun work?
[01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:53.537]  Which, by the way, the sun is not a ball of gas.
[01:15:53.537 --> 01:15:55.039]  It's condensed material.
[01:15:55.039 --> 01:15:55.380]  Hold on.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:55.840]  Don't hang up.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.922]  I want to hear more of this when we come back.
[01:15:59.713 --> 01:16:02.835]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[01:16:02.835 --> 01:16:08.279]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[01:16:08.279 --> 01:16:20.207]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[01:16:20.207 --> 01:16:24.790]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.911]  Get X2 now.
[01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:26.991]  It could be the last run ever.
[01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:28.172]  We get shut down.
[01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:29.033]  While you still can,
[01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:38.015]  At InfoWarsTore.com, research iodine deficiency and billions of people with cognitive disabilities because they don't have it.
[01:16:38.015 --> 01:16:43.536]  X2, X2, X2 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:43.536 --> 01:16:46.757]  Takes a few weeks to kick in, but it is the building block to everything.
[01:16:46.757 --> 01:16:47.477]  It's the missing link.
[01:16:47.477 --> 01:16:51.978]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family, but has the opposite effect.
[01:16:51.978 --> 01:16:55.678]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:57.399]  X2, back in stock right now.
[01:16:57.399 --> 01:16:58.539]  Discount at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:17:03.602 --> 01:17:07.504]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[01:17:07.504 --> 01:17:12.627]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.989]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:17:14.989 --> 01:17:16.990]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:19.792]  You Nazi scum!
[01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:23.894]  Let's free the patriots and defeat the globalist techies.
[01:17:23.894 --> 01:17:27.457]  We are going to defeat the globalists, very bigly.
[01:17:28.428 --> 01:17:38.636]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[01:17:38.636 --> 01:17:42.378]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[01:17:42.378 --> 01:17:43.619]  Oh, big deal.
[01:17:43.619 --> 01:17:45.401]  I'm taking you down, rapist.
[01:17:45.401 --> 01:17:49.203]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[01:17:49.203 --> 01:17:56.289]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored.
[01:17:59.486 --> 01:18:13.720]  Finally, after close to a year, in early November, where I'm cutting this ad, we finally got one of our flagship products back in stock, Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 organic.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.645]  You take it under the tongue, so you get better absorption of the body, through your blood vessels, and what it does,
[01:18:19.105 --> 01:18:19.545]  We're good.
[01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:42.648]  It's available from a top lab that we private label it through at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:42.648 --> 01:18:50.813]  Ultra 12, Vitamin B12, taken sublingually, now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.065]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:22.096]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls, wildcard, all sorts of stuff's being brought up.
[01:20:22.096 --> 01:20:26.120]  And Joe's bringing up Theory of the Universe.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.983]  And we're told every new theory is a fact, and they keep changing it.
[01:20:29.983 --> 01:20:33.165]  But you wanted to make a point about the sun, so just cut to the chase, Joe.
[01:20:33.165 --> 01:20:34.026]  What are you saying about the sun?
[01:20:34.026 --> 01:20:35.947]  You're talking about the surface of the sun.
[01:20:35.947 --> 01:20:36.568]  Uh, yeah.
[01:20:36.568 --> 01:20:44.674]  This guy, Dr. Pierre-Marie Robitaille, he is an expert on this subject, and he's done spectroscopic analysis.
[01:20:46.024 --> 01:20:52.908]  He says that the Sun, and this makes sense from a gravity perspective, is not gas.
[01:20:52.908 --> 01:20:56.990]  Actually, plasmas can be liquid, gases, or solid.
[01:20:56.990 --> 01:21:01.912]  The Sun is a ball of either liquid and or solid.
[01:21:01.912 --> 01:21:08.456]  Liquid, it seems to be on the surface, but it's not an illusion that it's a surface.
[01:21:08.456 --> 01:21:12.438]  It's actually a liquid, he says metallic hydrogen, surface.
[01:21:16.797 --> 01:21:21.800]  I was saying that the planets are connected to the Sun via these Birkeland's currents.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.603]  If the crew could pull up the cosmic web, there's these great photos of the cosmic web.
[01:21:26.603 --> 01:21:32.887]  It's like the Birkeland's currents going through intergalactic space.
[01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:36.869]  And all the galaxies are positioned along these Birkeland's currents.
[01:21:36.869 --> 01:21:39.951]  The arms of our galaxy are also Birkeland's currents.
[01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:44.834]  And the Sun is connected to the Earth via Birkeland's currents through the North and South Pole.
[01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:53.444]  And they acknowledge that there's these magnetic fields on Earth, but we know that magnetic fields and electrical fields always coexist.
[01:21:53.444 --> 01:21:54.804]  They can't exist without each other.
[01:21:54.804 --> 01:22:02.527]  And so to deny that there's electric currents in space, but acknowledge that there's magnetic fields, doesn't really make sense.
[01:22:02.527 --> 01:22:09.970]  And space is a perfect temperature to conduct electricity via these plasma currents, because
[01:22:10.578 --> 01:22:16.081]  The colder we know superconductivity on Earth occurs at extremely cold temperatures.
[01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:21.844]  And well, plasma doesn't have to be fully ionized to conduct electricity.
[01:22:21.844 --> 01:22:25.526]  And when it's fully ionized, you get like lightning, it's fully ionized.
[01:22:25.526 --> 01:22:27.167]  That's why it's bright and lit up.
[01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:28.828]  But it doesn't have to be in that glow mode.
[01:22:29.386 --> 01:22:31.687]  It's such an honor speaking with you today, brother.
[01:22:31.687 --> 01:22:33.187]  I want to talk about the rapid cancer in these injections.
[01:22:59.335 --> 01:23:00.596]  Turbo cancer.
[01:23:00.596 --> 01:23:09.923]  So my cousin, uh, he, he passed away September 24th of this year, not just almost two months ago of cancer.
[01:23:09.923 --> 01:23:15.487]  Uh, he first found out he got the cancer back in March, the same month he turned 50.
[01:23:15.487 --> 01:23:16.788]  He just turned 50 this year.
[01:23:16.788 --> 01:23:19.550]  But anyway, he never smoked.
[01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:21.072]  He never, he didn't even eat red meat.
[01:23:21.072 --> 01:23:24.054]  I mean, he was, he took really good care of himself.
[01:23:24.054 --> 01:23:28.077]  Um, they, they first found the cancer in his lungs and his spine.
[01:23:33.302 --> 01:23:42.546]  Well they admit that these MRNA shots literally turn cancer on.
[01:23:42.546 --> 01:23:45.248]  That's in mainline science.
[01:23:45.248 --> 01:23:46.748]  Everywhere they admit it's happening.
[01:23:46.748 --> 01:23:49.570]  Pfizer admits it.
[01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:53.372]  I mean the life expectancy in every country that took the shots is going straight down.
[01:23:54.599 --> 01:23:58.402]  He also got two strokes within a four or five month period.
[01:23:58.402 --> 01:24:03.806]  Did he take the shots?
[01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:14.994]  Yes, right after he passed away I learned that, well he worked at Walmart too, I don't think they mandate it, but he got two vaccines and then two boosters later, so I'm guessing within between 2020
[01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:19.773]  Well, I mean, we've got all those studies.
[01:24:19.773 --> 01:24:20.273]  They did it.
[01:24:20.273 --> 01:24:21.394]  They admit it.
[01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:23.395]  And they're just beta testing, killing everybody.
[01:24:23.395 --> 01:24:24.236]  I'm so sorry about that, my friend.
[01:24:44.195 --> 01:24:46.216]  Yeah, cancer doesn't ruin our family.
[01:24:46.216 --> 01:24:51.278]  Again, like I said, you know, and God bless everybody, you know, in this world.
[01:24:51.278 --> 01:24:57.661]  I just hope to God that people can just, you know, realize that they're killing us.
[01:24:57.661 --> 01:25:03.403]  They have $100,000 plus dollar bounties for every 200 children that they inject with it.
[01:25:03.403 --> 01:25:05.024]  And it's the same all over the Western world.
[01:25:05.024 --> 01:25:07.885]  You get a bounty for giving under two year olds a shot.
[01:25:07.885 --> 01:25:09.185]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:25:09.185 --> 01:25:10.266]  Now they have promo videos.
[01:25:11.738 --> 01:25:13.699]  In the U.S., Europe, Canada.
[01:25:13.699 --> 01:25:15.821]  I played one two days ago.
[01:25:15.821 --> 01:25:17.442]  On Sunday.
[01:25:17.442 --> 01:25:19.723]  Where they're, oh everyone has heart attacks now.
[01:25:19.723 --> 01:25:20.484]  Little kids do.
[01:25:20.484 --> 01:25:20.884]  You do.
[01:25:20.884 --> 01:25:22.905]  It's normal.
[01:25:22.905 --> 01:25:24.066]  You always had heart problems.
[01:25:24.066 --> 01:25:25.186]  You just didn't know it.
[01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.848]  It's so sick.
[01:25:26.848 --> 01:25:30.210]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:31.611]  Steve in South Carolina.
[01:25:31.611 --> 01:25:32.171]  You're on the air.
[01:25:32.171 --> 01:25:32.691]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:32.691 --> 01:25:34.372]  Go ahead.
[01:25:34.372 --> 01:25:35.413]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:25:35.413 --> 01:25:40.156]  I guess my question is, what are we going to get hit with next?
[01:25:40.999 --> 01:26:08.233]  Okay, anybody that's been following your show for any length of time, alright, they hit us with the shots, they're telling us that they're going to hit the internet, kill switch, they're going to trump supporters, they're going to attack the electrical grid, and I honestly, in my personal belief, I think with all of these assets in the Middle East, history is going to repeat itself once again.
[01:26:09.451 --> 01:26:10.852]  Problem, what does it cause?
[01:26:10.852 --> 01:26:13.393]  Problem, reaction.
[01:26:13.393 --> 01:26:16.334]  Alien dialectic, problem, reaction, solution.
[01:26:16.334 --> 01:26:17.414]  That's it, that's it.
[01:26:17.414 --> 01:26:22.256]  No, I think the question you raised almost when you first asked what the order is, what are they planning next?
[01:26:22.256 --> 01:26:24.237]  I mean, they've already killed a bunch of us.
[01:26:24.237 --> 01:26:28.058]  They're telling us what we're about to do, which means what they're about to do.
[01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:28.819]  Exactly.
[01:26:28.819 --> 01:26:36.222]  And with all of these assets in the Middle East, we've got submarines, aircraft carrier groups, the Chinese got submarines.
[01:26:37.677 --> 01:26:39.558]  That's where it's going to happen.
[01:26:39.558 --> 01:26:45.021]  It has to happen over there because that gives them the place to do it.
[01:26:45.021 --> 01:26:50.243]  What they're going to do, something has to trigger off the Great Reset.
[01:26:50.243 --> 01:26:52.804]  I mean, they've got to bring in the new currency.
[01:26:52.804 --> 01:26:54.425]  It's like World War II set up the UN.
[01:26:54.425 --> 01:26:56.746]  Now they're bringing in the big control.
[01:26:56.746 --> 01:26:58.867]  And it's like a gun to their head to depopulate us.
[01:26:58.867 --> 01:26:59.848]  They just keep doing it.
[01:27:01.661 --> 01:27:17.329]  Yeah, and you know, the other day I was going through my phone because I saved a bunch of stuff from Dan's video, and when you interviewed Andrew Huff, obviously I got his book, I just got your book signed the other day, thank you.
[01:27:17.329 --> 01:27:18.030]  Thank you.
[01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:29.496]  And I watched that whole video, and it just blew my mind, and that was in, I think, October of 21, I may be wrong, but I know it was in 21 when you interviewed him.
[01:27:30.086 --> 01:27:48.871]  And then when you start reading the book again, and it's like, I had a family member, I won't mention her name, and I was, I gave her these pamphlets from the Geoengineering Watch with Dane Williamson, and there were four planes spraying us the other day over here.
[01:27:48.871 --> 01:27:50.332]  And I says, do you see that?
[01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:55.693]  I says, do you understand that they're spraying us with nanoparticles?
[01:27:55.693 --> 01:27:57.534]  And she said, looked up at her and says,
[01:27:58.191 --> 01:27:59.592]  Well, if that's what it really is.
[01:27:59.592 --> 01:28:06.434]  And I'm just like, you know, like Ed Dowd said, we can't waste our time with these people anymore.
[01:28:06.434 --> 01:28:11.876]  They either have to be on board, get on board, and we just need to leave them behind.
[01:28:11.876 --> 01:28:12.256]  That's right.
[01:28:12.256 --> 01:28:25.701]  We have crazy mad scientists that believe they're God, literally killing the planet and telling us the Earth's about to die because we're bad, and civilization's about to collapse while they cut off the fertilizer, the food, the energy, the infrastructure.
[01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:26.962]  I mean, this is it.
[01:28:27.796 --> 01:28:33.380]  I don't know if they've made deals with aliens, devils, whatever you want to call it, but they've made a deal to wipe us out.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.882]  And it's happening now.
[01:28:34.882 --> 01:28:37.364]  And people pretend like they're part of the power structure going along with it.
[01:28:37.364 --> 01:28:38.264]  You're not.
[01:28:38.264 --> 01:28:40.286]  You're all destroying yourselves.
[01:28:40.286 --> 01:28:41.427]  God bless you, Steve.
[01:28:41.427 --> 01:28:41.907]  Thank you.
[01:28:41.907 --> 01:28:47.371]  Russell, Nicholas, Alan, Jeff, Kevin, Bart, Frederick, Kathy, Lucy, Donna.
[01:28:47.371 --> 01:28:48.532]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:50.374]  Your calls when we come back.
[01:28:50.374 --> 01:28:50.894]  Stay with us.
[01:28:50.894 --> 01:28:51.535]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:59.378 --> 01:29:15.175]  Normally Christmas is our biggest sale of the year, but because of supply chain breakdowns and other issues, this is our biggest sale because finally almost all of our best-selling products are finally back in stock, including sold out for more than a year, X2, the only true
[01:29:15.795 --> 01:29:19.059]  Nacent iodine out there is finally back.
[01:29:19.059 --> 01:29:23.643]  What it does for your immune system, your body, all your cells is miraculous.
[01:29:23.643 --> 01:29:25.585]  It's discounted at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:29:25.585 --> 01:29:31.091]  Double patriot points, free shipping, biggest sale hands down of 2023.
[01:29:31.091 --> 01:29:33.854]  I'm sure Christmas will have a big sale, but we'll be sold out of most of this.
[01:29:33.854 --> 01:29:35.736]  So Christmas has come early.
[01:29:35.736 --> 01:29:37.277]  Black Friday's come early.
[01:29:37.277 --> 01:29:38.639]  And it funds the InfoWar.

[01:29:52.505 --> 01:29:54.345]  Could be our last run if we're shut down.

[01:29:55.426 --> 01:29:56.146]  X2.
[01:29:56.146 --> 01:29:57.927]  Discount at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:29:59.159 --> 01:30:05.362]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:30:05.362 --> 01:30:10.044]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:30:10.044 --> 01:30:14.426]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[01:30:15.846 --> 01:30:18.908]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:30:18.908 --> 01:30:20.469]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:30:20.469 --> 01:30:26.433]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:30:26.433 --> 01:30:32.457]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[01:30:32.457 --> 01:30:35.219]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:30:37.108 --> 01:30:38.329]  I don't know.
[01:30:58.863 --> 01:31:02.924]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:06.485]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:31:06.485 --> 01:31:11.586]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:31:11.586 --> 01:31:14.027]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:31:14.027 --> 01:31:22.629]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:23.929]  This is the Great Awakening.
[01:31:24.469 --> 01:31:28.834]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:31:28.834 --> 01:31:30.616]  It's a companion to my last book.
[01:31:30.616 --> 01:31:35.502]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[01:31:35.502 --> 01:31:39.326]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:31:39.446 --> 01:31:39.826]  Thank you.
[01:31:58.817 --> 01:32:03.218]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:32:03.218 --> 01:32:08.460]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullwhorestore.com.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:20.803]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:32:20.803 --> 01:32:23.984]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:32:24.784 --> 01:32:37.809]  Both of these have known, documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:32:37.809 --> 01:32:40.109]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:44.191]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve
[01:32:44.671 --> 01:32:45.351]  We're good to go.
[01:33:16.321 --> 01:33:18.446]  Big Brother.
[01:33:18.446 --> 01:33:21.231]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:21.231 --> 01:33:22.333]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:23.855 --> 01:33:25.256]  You want answers?
[01:33:25.256 --> 01:33:27.678]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.678 --> 01:33:33.662]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.662 --> 01:33:36.605]  Alright, so I'll give myself a B-minus getting the calls here.
[01:33:36.605 --> 01:33:39.086]  They're great calls, but they're on too long.
[01:33:39.086 --> 01:33:40.567]  You gotta get to everybody.
[01:33:40.567 --> 01:33:41.828]  So just be ready with your points.
[01:33:41.828 --> 01:33:43.710]  I'm going right to you, right now.
[01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:46.512]  I'm going to California next to talk to Russell.
[01:33:46.512 --> 01:33:47.873]  Russell, you're on the air.
[01:33:47.873 --> 01:33:49.514]  Go ahead.
[01:33:49.514 --> 01:33:51.916]  Hey, thank you Alex for taking my call.
[01:33:52.509 --> 01:33:56.110]  Happy holidays to you and your crew there.
[01:33:56.110 --> 01:34:14.297]  One of the things that strikes us and some of my friends and colleagues and family members is that when Trump becomes president, how is he going to implement all the things he wants to do, especially when you've got a deep state Justice Department, the Border Patrol,
[01:34:15.521 --> 01:34:23.525]  Well, if he does what he should have done, he can fire every one of the directors and put people in when he gets in.
[01:34:23.525 --> 01:34:26.006]  But how do you do that without force?
[01:34:26.006 --> 01:34:26.667]  How do you do that?
[01:34:26.667 --> 01:34:29.308]  Well, I mean, the presidency has the power to fire those people.
[01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:37.331]  Well, I mean, I understand that he's going to wave a magic wand and they're going to leave their office and go on.
[01:34:37.331 --> 01:34:42.973]  Well, I mean, under federal law, with executive positions, the president can fire all of them.
[01:34:42.973 --> 01:34:45.534]  Every, the Justice Department head, all the U.S.
[01:34:45.534 --> 01:34:47.054]  Bill Clinton fired all the U.S.
[01:34:47.054 --> 01:34:50.375]  attorneys, or 98 of the 100, his first day in office in 1993.
[01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:50.576]  Absolutely.
[01:34:52.156 --> 01:34:58.961]  Trump thought he could co-opt them and have them work with him, and they lied to his face and he didn't do the background research he did on judges.
[01:34:58.961 --> 01:35:00.382]  That's why we repealed Roe v. Wade.
[01:35:00.382 --> 01:35:01.622]  It wasn't perfect.
[01:35:01.622 --> 01:35:04.484]  But yeah, he can do that.
[01:35:04.484 --> 01:35:14.691]  Yeah, but I can see the Republicans and the Democrats in the House and the Senate rally against him to make him lame duck and try and restrict him from doing it.
[01:35:14.691 --> 01:35:15.932]  So what do you propose?
[01:35:19.007 --> 01:35:19.888]  I'm just asking you.
[01:35:19.888 --> 01:35:20.568]  Well, I hope so.
[01:35:20.568 --> 01:35:22.869]  We would like to see it without any kind of stacking body issues.
[01:35:37.506 --> 01:35:41.531]  Yeah, well, they're trying to keep him out with all these fake indictments and all the rest of it.
[01:35:41.531 --> 01:35:44.134]  But no, Trump has said, I didn't understand before.
[01:35:44.134 --> 01:35:45.635]  I didn't know they lied to my face.
[01:35:45.635 --> 01:35:47.558]  He's going off their voting records and who they are.
[01:35:47.558 --> 01:35:49.239]  He won't get everybody perfect in.
[01:35:49.239 --> 01:35:51.382]  But if he gets in, that's why they're so scared.
[01:35:51.382 --> 01:35:53.464]  That's why he says he's going to become a dictator, which isn't true.
[01:35:53.464 --> 01:35:56.328]  It's because they're setting up a totalitarian system.
[01:35:56.328 --> 01:35:57.088]  But no, the president...
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.121]  Fires, you know, admirals, generals.
[01:36:02.121 --> 01:36:03.922]  He could fire Mayorkas if he was in there right now.
[01:36:03.922 --> 01:36:05.883]  He could fire Merrick Garland right now.
[01:36:05.883 --> 01:36:07.623]  Remember, he fired the FBI director.
[01:36:07.623 --> 01:36:08.304]  Remember that?
[01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:09.544]  Comey?
[01:36:09.544 --> 01:36:10.364]  Yeah.
[01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.325]  Alright, thanks for the call, sir.
[01:36:11.325 --> 01:36:12.645]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:12.645 --> 01:36:19.948]  I mean, I don't mean, I'm not even disagreeing with you, but it's just a fact the President could fire all these people.
[01:36:19.948 --> 01:36:22.169]  So I don't, you see, why do they refuse to leave?
[01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:26.271]  That's what they're accusing Trump of doing, but he didn't do that.
[01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:28.392]  Alright, let's go to Nicholas in Massachusetts.
[01:36:28.392 --> 01:36:31.834]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:36:31.834 --> 01:36:32.374]  Hello?
[01:36:32.374 --> 01:36:32.854]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:36:32.854 --> 01:36:36.456]  Hey, brother in Christ, General Jones.
[01:36:36.456 --> 01:36:38.477]  Honor and a privilege to get through the airwaves.
[01:36:38.477 --> 01:36:39.277]  Honor to talk to you.
[01:36:39.277 --> 01:36:41.498]  What's on your mind, Nicholas?
[01:36:41.498 --> 01:36:44.039]  I've been a listener right before the 2016 election.
[01:36:44.039 --> 01:36:46.981]  Just dropped a buck-eighty on your outstanding products.
[01:36:46.981 --> 01:36:49.942]  I try to support every month, you know, put your money where your mouth is.
[01:36:49.942 --> 01:36:51.423]  You're the reason we're on air, brother.
[01:36:51.423 --> 01:36:52.083]  Thank you, Nicholas.
[01:36:53.069 --> 01:36:54.330]  Yes sir, thank you.
[01:36:54.330 --> 01:37:03.817]  All I wanted to say is... YEAH!
[01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:04.997]  YEAH!
[01:37:04.997 --> 01:37:08.060]  The spirit of Massachusetts is the spirit of America.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:15.165]  I bought the Trump shirt that says, uh, support, uh, never surrender on the back, um, you know.
[01:37:15.165 --> 01:37:16.846]  Hey, you're the one keeping us on air, brother.
[01:37:16.846 --> 01:37:18.247]  You wanted to talk about, uh, what?
[01:37:19.768 --> 01:37:21.650]  Uh, the products, they're just outstanding.
[01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:22.971]  That's all I wanted to say, man.
[01:37:22.971 --> 01:37:25.313]  Keep up the good fight, you know?
[01:37:25.313 --> 01:37:26.715]  Brother, thanks for holding to say that.
[01:37:26.715 --> 01:37:28.977]  It really means a lot to me, that's why I hang in here.
[01:37:28.977 --> 01:37:30.739]  We have a mission to complete.
[01:37:30.739 --> 01:37:37.005]  Hope we can stay on air at least until the election, maybe for a lot longer, but it's you keeping us on air, so don't thank me, I thank you.
[01:37:37.005 --> 01:37:37.985]  Thank you, Nicholas.
[01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:39.467]  Let's go to Jeff in South Carolina.
[01:37:39.467 --> 01:37:40.027]  Jeff, go ahead.
[01:37:40.027 --> 01:37:43.591]  Hello.
[01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:44.392]  Yep, go ahead, Jeff.
[01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:44.692]  Welcome.
[01:37:45.737 --> 01:37:53.221]  Hey Alex, listen, I do want to talk about the white supremacy comment that Joe Biden showed earlier you put on there.
[01:37:53.221 --> 01:37:54.282]  Yes.
[01:37:54.282 --> 01:38:01.005]  But, on a personal note, I grew up without a father, raised by a single mom in China.
[01:38:01.005 --> 01:38:07.849]  I remember asking her about my father and she said, quote, he was a fine American man, handsome.
[01:38:07.849 --> 01:38:11.251]  He was called Fentanyl.
[01:38:11.251 --> 01:38:12.492]  I was thinking that might be you.
[01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:15.594]  All right, brother, I appreciate your call.
[01:38:15.594 --> 01:38:23.276]  Yeah, my six-year-old daughter loves Fentanyl, the Chinese Communist Dragon.
[01:38:23.276 --> 01:38:30.157]  And so a few times in public and a few times when friends are over, she'll go, Daddy, let's look at Fentanyl.
[01:38:30.157 --> 01:38:31.278]  People go, whoa.
[01:38:31.278 --> 01:38:35.499]  So I named the dragon, the cartoon character Fentanyl, and then my daughter's always like,
[01:38:38.342 --> 01:38:38.882]  We're good to go.
[01:38:56.627 --> 01:38:58.568]  Let's set off the fentanyl!
[01:38:58.568 --> 01:39:00.089]  Let's fentanyl, fentanyl!
[01:39:00.089 --> 01:39:03.890]  And I'm like, that's the power of a cartoon with kids, folks.
[01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:05.811]  So she's only seen it a few times.
[01:39:05.811 --> 01:39:08.092]  I just caught you, American!
[01:39:08.092 --> 01:39:13.855]  And she, uh, I didn't quite follow what you said about your dad, your mom, fentanyl, but wow, that's quite the call.
[01:39:13.855 --> 01:39:14.655]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:14.655 --> 01:39:15.696]  Kevin in Colorado.
[01:39:15.696 --> 01:39:16.476]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:39:16.476 --> 01:39:17.737]  Welcome.
[01:39:17.737 --> 01:39:19.198]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:19.198 --> 01:39:21.799]  I just wanted to ask you a question.
[01:39:21.799 --> 01:39:24.200]  Joe Biden, during the first year of his presidency,
[01:39:24.921 --> 01:39:27.802]  I believe it was during a State of the Union address.
[01:39:27.802 --> 01:39:32.743]  He mentioned something really, really strange, and I've never heard anybody talk about it.
[01:39:32.743 --> 01:39:39.864]  But sometimes when you talk about the vaccines and the possible cognitive issues due to prions, it reminds me of what he said.
[01:39:39.864 --> 01:39:41.785]  And there was no segue.
[01:39:41.785 --> 01:39:43.805]  He just spit it out of the blue.
[01:39:43.805 --> 01:39:48.046]  And he said that there's going to be an epidemic of young Americans hospitalized
[01:39:48.812 --> 01:39:51.793]  And it's going to overwhelm our medical system.
[01:39:51.793 --> 01:39:52.333]  I remember that.
[01:39:52.333 --> 01:39:53.153]  Stop right there.
[01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:56.033]  Guys, type in YouTube or Twitter.
[01:39:56.033 --> 01:40:01.474]  Joe Biden says there's going to be an epidemic of young people who are sick.
[01:40:01.474 --> 01:40:07.295]  And now Gates has been saying for a year, the next virus will strike children.
[01:40:07.295 --> 01:40:09.036]  I remember that very chilling.
[01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:11.976]  What do you think he was slipping up and saying?
[01:40:11.976 --> 01:40:16.737]  It was one of the most bizarre things I've heard from a guy that makes the habit out of saying bizarre things.
[01:40:17.168 --> 01:40:19.369]  And I'll never forget him saying that either.
[01:40:19.369 --> 01:40:22.570]  And this was during the, um, really the height of the pandemic.
[01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:26.171]  That's Biden's State of the Union says, uh, what was the exact quote?
[01:40:26.171 --> 01:40:26.791]  You said it right.
[01:40:26.791 --> 01:40:30.793]  It was, uh, Biden says young people will be hospitalized with mystery illness.
[01:40:30.793 --> 01:40:32.133]  What was it?
[01:40:32.133 --> 01:40:35.814]  It was, um, our, our medical system would be overwhelmed.
[01:40:35.814 --> 01:40:37.875]  Like it was going to crash our medical system.
[01:40:37.875 --> 01:40:38.055]  Yeah.
[01:40:38.055 --> 01:40:38.295]  Yeah.
[01:40:38.295 --> 01:40:42.517]  So Biden says an illness in young people will soon overwhelm our medical system.
[01:40:42.517 --> 01:40:43.037]  I remember that.
[01:40:44.031 --> 01:40:49.275]  Yeah, I was wondering if whenever you're talking about the vaccine and the Brion issue, maybe if you could play that clip.
[01:40:49.275 --> 01:40:51.696]  Yeah, if this crew can't find it, we got other crew in the building.
[01:40:51.696 --> 01:40:52.777]  Find me the clip, get it.
[01:40:52.777 --> 01:40:54.218]  I remember he said it.
[01:40:54.218 --> 01:40:57.180]  I think it's first or second State of the Union, right?
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:59.342]  Yeah, yeah, real early in his presidency.
[01:40:59.342 --> 01:40:59.822]  There it is.
[01:40:59.822 --> 01:41:02.404]  Biden deploying military medical staff to help overwhelm.
[01:41:02.404 --> 01:41:05.886]  No, that was him during COVID.
[01:41:05.886 --> 01:41:10.189]  It's about young people in a mystery illness overwhelming hospitals.
[01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.709]  All right.
[01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:11.370]  Anything else, Kevin?
[01:41:12.364 --> 01:41:14.206]  No, keep on keeping on Alex.
[01:41:14.206 --> 01:41:17.028]  It's going to be really weird going through the crash without you.
[01:41:17.028 --> 01:41:17.908]  You know?
[01:41:17.908 --> 01:41:20.150]  I've been listening a long time, brother.
[01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:21.071]  And God bless you.
[01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:21.852]  God bless you, man.
[01:41:21.852 --> 01:41:23.913]  All right, let's go to Barton, Georgia.
[01:41:23.913 --> 01:41:24.614]  Bart, you're on the air.
[01:41:24.614 --> 01:41:26.155]  Welcome.
[01:41:26.155 --> 01:41:26.655]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:26.655 --> 01:41:31.259]  I've taken time out of my busy schedule to go down to the post office, get stamps, write letters.
[01:41:31.259 --> 01:41:39.686]  I've sent Owen two letters, and I heard the lawyer saying he's not getting his letters, and I don't want him to be abused further by my comments.
[01:41:40.365 --> 01:41:45.789]  I'm calling out this abuse by the Oakdale facility and whoever this incompetent warden is.
[01:41:45.789 --> 01:41:47.610]  He needs to be removed.
[01:41:47.610 --> 01:41:50.552]  And I also got the X2 and turmeric toothpaste.
[01:41:50.552 --> 01:41:51.713]  Every drop counts.
[01:41:51.713 --> 01:41:53.114]  Every dime counts.
[01:41:53.114 --> 01:41:54.575]  Take advantage of the free shipping.
[01:41:55.814 --> 01:41:56.355]  Absolutely.
[01:41:56.355 --> 01:42:02.799]  Look, Owen loves letters, but more importantly, just promote free speech and promote the fight against the globalists.
[01:42:02.799 --> 01:42:05.241]  Letters are great, but of course you're not giving him the letters.
[01:42:05.241 --> 01:42:07.583]  It's all about abusing him.
[01:42:07.583 --> 01:42:09.404]  It's not an incompetent warden.
[01:42:09.404 --> 01:42:13.147]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:42:13.147 --> 01:42:14.889]  Yeah, well I'm praying for Owen Schroeder.
[01:42:14.889 --> 01:42:19.872]  I want everybody listening, I don't care what religion you are, pray for Owen right now and his safety.
[01:42:19.872 --> 01:42:22.034]  Absolutely, and pray for all the political prisoners.
[01:42:22.034 --> 01:42:23.295]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:23.295 --> 01:42:23.695]  All right.
[01:42:24.889 --> 01:42:27.129]  We're gonna go break, come back with Lucy, Donna.
[01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:31.791]  Alaina and others straight ahead.
[01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:33.552]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:42:33.552 --> 01:42:54.100]  The coordinates of freedom are band.video, just the word band, and then dot video, band.video, infowars.com, but they block band.video being promoted on any major big tech site, but the site to tweet out that takes you there is madmaxworld.tv, and all the sub URLs, madmaxworld.tv, madmaxworld.tv.
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:55.260]  Please share it now.
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:56.301]  It's all going to help us win.
[01:42:58.919 --> 01:43:04.362]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[01:43:04.362 --> 01:43:14.188]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:16.890]  GMO, all of it.
[01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:21.372]  But God's given us compounds through nature that do incredible things in our body.
[01:43:21.372 --> 01:43:25.134]  And one of the most important, if not the most important, is vitamin B12.
[01:43:25.134 --> 01:43:33.939]  We've got the best organic vitamin B12, Ultra 12, a bestseller finally back in stock after close to a year being sold out.

[01:43:42.423 --> 01:43:42.803]  Thank you.
[01:43:58.792 --> 01:44:03.493]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.

[01:44:07.514 --> 01:44:09.974]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:44:09.974 --> 01:44:10.795]  Hey, what's better?
[01:44:10.795 --> 01:44:11.655]  Knockout?
[01:44:11.655 --> 01:44:12.995]  What's better?
[01:44:12.995 --> 01:44:13.735]  Down-and-out?
[01:44:13.735 --> 01:44:14.255]  What's better?
[01:44:14.255 --> 01:44:16.536]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?

[01:47:15.803 --> 01:47:21.046]  Alright, we're racing through your phone calls here on this live Tuesday, November 21st transmission.
[01:47:21.046 --> 01:47:22.667]  Lucy in California, welcome.
[01:47:22.667 --> 01:47:24.628]  Thanks for calling in.
[01:47:24.628 --> 01:47:26.770]  Hi Alex, I love you.
[01:47:26.770 --> 01:47:28.651]  Love you too.
[01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:31.253]  So I'm calling the power of prayer.
[01:47:31.253 --> 01:47:31.973]  I know that you've
[01:47:32.526 --> 01:47:54.998]  You said that the power prayer for a global awakening so I think it's happening and we're seeing it and I think we should just continue to pray and for you know for the elections to come in next year for God to intervene and I know that you said that you want to pray more on air and I think millions of us watching and joining you in prayer I think we can move mountains.
[01:47:54.998 --> 01:48:01.842]  No I agree and look as bad as things are if we don't fight back they'll just be much worse and so we have a responsibility to stand up against this
[01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:05.086]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.086 --> 01:48:08.991]  Well, yeah, that's all I wanted to say and I hope that God intervenes.
[01:48:08.991 --> 01:48:12.917]  I pray that God intervenes in the next year's election and that we win.
[01:48:12.917 --> 01:48:13.678]  I pray that too.
[01:48:13.678 --> 01:48:14.379]  Thank you, Lucy.
[01:48:14.379 --> 01:48:15.540]  Amazing call.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.922]  Frederick in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:48:16.922 --> 01:48:17.203]  Go ahead.
[01:48:18.488 --> 01:48:20.370]  Alex, a couple things.
[01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.851]  I'm in my 50s.
[01:48:21.851 --> 01:48:26.454]  I don't play video games, but I bought your game, and the voiceovers are just hilarious.
[01:48:26.454 --> 01:48:27.435]  People really need to buy it.
[01:48:27.435 --> 01:48:28.456]  It's just funny.
[01:48:28.456 --> 01:48:32.178]  Well, let me say something about that.
[01:48:32.178 --> 01:48:34.740]  It's been a giant hit in the reviews.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:36.702]  It's been mega viral everywhere.
[01:48:36.702 --> 01:48:37.823]  It hasn't made a ton of money.
[01:48:37.823 --> 01:48:39.184]  We're trying to fund the operation with it.
[01:48:40.144 --> 01:48:41.964]  It's been a success.
[01:48:41.964 --> 01:48:43.485]  Monetarily, moderately so.
[01:48:43.485 --> 01:48:49.986]  But as for news, the top video game reviewers have said it's the best throwback game in a decade.
[01:48:49.986 --> 01:48:51.406]  And they're blown away by it.
[01:48:51.406 --> 01:48:56.087]  The people that made it approached me like almost two years ago and said, will you do a game?
[01:48:56.087 --> 01:48:59.247]  And I knew they'd make it.
[01:48:59.247 --> 01:49:01.188]  Actually hit the wrong button here, sorry.
[01:49:01.188 --> 01:49:05.608]  And so the game has turned out to be really great.
[01:49:05.608 --> 01:49:06.609]  And I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:49:06.609 --> 01:49:07.689]  AlexJonesGame.com.
[01:49:07.689 --> 01:49:08.429]  So I'm glad you liked it.
[01:49:09.145 --> 01:49:10.746]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:49:10.746 --> 01:49:11.207]  It's great.
[01:49:11.207 --> 01:49:12.188]  I'm so glad I got it.
[01:49:12.188 --> 01:49:13.549]  And people really need to buy it.
[01:49:13.549 --> 01:49:24.177]  Another thing, shortly after President Turd in my pants took office, I had a couple dreams about Chinese troops on our soil.
[01:49:24.177 --> 01:49:32.223]  And this was before Michael Yan's reporting of, of course, the Darien Gap and the Chinese military age men coming across our border.
[01:49:33.403 --> 01:49:34.123]  A couple questions.
[01:49:34.123 --> 01:49:38.785]  Do you think they have sleeper cells in every state?
[01:49:38.785 --> 01:49:50.908]  And how and when, in your opinion, maybe in your gut, do you think those sleeper cells will be activated?
[01:49:50.908 --> 01:49:52.628]  They're totally normalizing.
[01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:54.228]  The CHICOMs run most of Hollywood.
[01:49:54.228 --> 01:49:55.769]  They run most universities.
[01:49:55.769 --> 01:49:58.229]  Thousands of public schools they fund and control.
[01:49:58.229 --> 01:50:00.050]  And so if we get in a major war with China, they'll
[01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:01.910]  I don't
[01:50:23.936 --> 01:50:24.757]  Preschool students.
[01:50:24.757 --> 01:50:31.341]  I mean, it's just all about walking on us, training us to be slaves, cutting our sons' genitals off.
[01:50:31.341 --> 01:50:32.983]  I mean, we were already completely overrun.
[01:50:32.983 --> 01:50:34.324]  I mean, it's not going to come with U.N.
[01:50:34.324 --> 01:50:35.124]  helmets.
[01:50:35.124 --> 01:50:35.965]  It comes with U.N.
[01:50:35.965 --> 01:50:37.326]  treaties over our health care.
[01:50:37.326 --> 01:50:38.407]  We were already under a U.N.
[01:50:38.407 --> 01:50:43.570]  emergency with lockdowns and masks and shots and just all of the abuse.
[01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.892]  We're already in it.
[01:50:45.892 --> 01:50:48.734]  So you don't think they'll shut down, say, the Grenadier blowups?
[01:50:48.734 --> 01:50:49.735]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:49.735 --> 01:50:51.016]  That's down the road.
[01:50:51.016 --> 01:50:52.197]  They've got that planned.
[01:50:53.223 --> 01:50:55.905]  But I'm saying, we're already under UN treaties.
[01:50:55.905 --> 01:50:58.267]  We're already under the New World Order.
[01:50:58.267 --> 01:51:01.469]  If they need to fire shots, they'll do it later.
[01:51:01.469 --> 01:51:07.473]  We already have a Justice Department at war with the American people.
[01:51:07.473 --> 01:51:14.679]  And with all the universities indoctrinating these students, how do you feel that will come into play in terms of all the youth
[01:51:17.897 --> 01:51:20.518]  Well, most of the colleges don't teach G.G.
[01:51:20.518 --> 01:51:23.460]  Ping's great, Mao's great.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:30.723]  They just teach malice ideology and the breakdown of society and fund Black Lives Matter.
[01:51:30.723 --> 01:51:34.045]  That's why Antifa calls themselves a malice movement.
[01:51:34.045 --> 01:51:38.567]  So when you look at it, it's malice because it's hand in glove.
[01:51:39.361 --> 01:51:43.224]  With the Weathermen, with the Democratic Party, I mean, half the Weathermen ended up in the U.S.
[01:51:43.224 --> 01:51:43.805]  government.
[01:51:43.805 --> 01:51:50.531]  I mean, the government is run by super evil academics who obviously don't want freedom for people.
[01:51:50.531 --> 01:51:52.993]  That's their pop culture communism.
[01:51:52.993 --> 01:51:56.436]  It's all about absolute control for them.
[01:51:56.436 --> 01:51:58.718]  One final question, I know you gotta go.
[01:51:58.718 --> 01:52:04.863]  All the sources you've had throughout the years, particularly the ones that you really gotta keep secret,
[01:52:05.782 --> 01:52:12.905]  Are there one or two or a couple things that maybe you've been told that you just cannot tell us?
[01:52:12.905 --> 01:52:18.587]  No, I mean, everybody thinks intelligence agencies like Hollywood and James Bond are magic.
[01:52:18.587 --> 01:52:20.908]  They're some of the most brainwashed control people ever.
[01:52:20.908 --> 01:52:24.450]  Almost all of my research, almost all of my work is open source.
[01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:29.552]  The world government, the Satanism, the pedophilia, the open borders, it's all out in the open.
[01:52:31.007 --> 01:52:35.250]  I mean, yeah, like a TSA source, hey, they're going to try to roll out lockdowns again, and they tried it.
[01:52:35.250 --> 01:52:38.653]  They've actually done it in Australia, mask, all of it again.
[01:52:38.653 --> 01:52:42.275]  That's a source on a particular thing that's about to happen.
[01:52:42.275 --> 01:52:48.560]  So those are very valuable, but I'm not saying this to act cool or something, but I mean, the intelligence agencies listen to me.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:50.281]  I don't listen to them.
[01:52:50.281 --> 01:52:52.263]  They're not telling me what to say or do.
[01:52:52.263 --> 01:52:58.768]  There's a bunch of people in those groups that have tried to play ball with the system, and they've been put in power because they're yes men and women.
[01:52:59.437 --> 01:53:00.557]  Or they've got a chip on their shoulder.
[01:53:00.557 --> 01:53:04.158]  But some of them aren't bad people and they've now been de-compartmentalized.
[01:53:04.158 --> 01:53:05.378]  And so that's really where it's at.
[01:53:05.378 --> 01:53:10.140]  I mean, I don't really get anything from these intelligence agencies and people.
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:10.720]  It's nothing.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.640]  It's nothing of any use.
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:12.540]  It's all a bunch of crap.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:14.141]  A bunch of controlled jokes.
[01:53:14.141 --> 01:53:16.081]  They just love their title and think they're secret agents.
[01:53:16.081 --> 01:53:19.102]  They can't even find their ass with both hands, most of them.
[01:53:19.102 --> 01:53:22.483]  And I had family back when things weren't internet intelligence.
[01:53:22.483 --> 01:53:24.243]  It wasn't signals intelligence.
[01:53:24.243 --> 01:53:27.344]  It was mainly human intelligence who thought they were serving the country.
[01:53:28.545 --> 01:53:33.850]  And they came back and said, we can't tell you, but the government's evil and kidnaps children and they're devil worshippers.
[01:53:33.850 --> 01:53:35.071]  The whole government's evil.
[01:53:35.071 --> 01:53:39.295]  And then all they do is go to church five days a week and just freak out and stay in their houses after whatever they saw.
[01:53:39.295 --> 01:53:41.176]  So, I mean, we can't tell you.
[01:53:41.176 --> 01:53:41.977]  It's the government's pure evil.
[01:53:41.977 --> 01:53:42.678]  It's all over.
[01:53:42.678 --> 01:53:43.358]  Better get Jesus.
[01:53:43.358 --> 01:53:44.639]  You know, that's it.
[01:53:44.639 --> 01:53:45.160]  Well, what?
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.521]  On their deathbed, they kidnap children.
[01:53:46.521 --> 01:53:47.562]  They murder the bastard.
[01:53:47.562 --> 01:53:50.925]  You know, it's like deathbed confessions.
[01:53:50.925 --> 01:53:52.427]  Not people that did anything, but they just saw it.
[01:53:53.368 --> 01:53:53.588]  Hi.
[01:53:53.588 --> 01:53:53.948]  Two things.
[01:53:53.948 --> 01:54:00.172]  I want to inspire all of us during this dark time, not only winter, but obviously the dark time that we're in, to heed a call of our time.
[01:54:21.986 --> 01:54:23.047]  And two things.
[01:54:23.047 --> 01:54:33.031]  First, if you will, be gracious to play my song, We Are One, that unites us, Alex, in the great I Am.
[01:54:33.031 --> 01:54:43.496]  And then the second part of my message is that in the darkness of winter, also in darkness of time, we're called to do giving and charity.
[01:54:43.496 --> 01:54:46.117]  And so I just want to encourage all of us
[01:54:46.744 --> 01:54:50.045]  To live a new charitable lifestyle.
[01:54:50.045 --> 01:54:56.807]  It actually heals the mind, it heals the body, and it restores the soul individually and collectively.
[01:54:56.807 --> 01:55:04.830]  To give charity to InfoWars, even if you commit 22 bucks a month, continuously.
[01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:10.151]  And I choose $22 because 22 means completion.
[01:55:10.151 --> 01:55:11.352]  It means fulfillment.
[01:55:11.352 --> 01:55:12.312]  It means justice.
[01:55:12.984 --> 01:55:20.327]  So I just had an idea, and I emailed you, for everybody around the world to commit to charity.
[01:55:20.327 --> 01:55:21.228]  Continually.
[01:55:21.228 --> 01:55:22.748]  $22 to InfoWars.
[01:55:22.748 --> 01:55:26.670]  And people in your community, but InfoWars.
[01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:30.432]  Well thank you, that'd be great if people want to support and get great products at the same time.
[01:55:30.432 --> 01:55:33.393]  And we're trying to stay on air, but at a certain point I'm tired of begging, we'll just shut down.
[01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:36.395]  I mean look, but the point is, is that, is that
[01:55:38.286 --> 01:55:46.910]  Spreading the word about the truth and fighting the globalists is most important, and I appreciate your support, but I just don't want to squeeze people to support us if they want to.
[01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:47.851]  That's great.
[01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:52.073]  The big thing is we got products you need to enrich your life like X2 and others right now.
[01:55:52.073 --> 01:55:53.774]  But tell us the name of your song again.
[01:55:53.774 --> 01:55:55.995]  I think you called in like six months ago.
[01:55:55.995 --> 01:55:56.835]  I think I saw your song.
[01:55:56.835 --> 01:55:58.656]  It was pretty good, and I'm going from memory.
[01:55:58.656 --> 01:55:59.677]  You called in before, right?
[01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:01.534]  She dropped off.
[01:56:01.534 --> 01:56:04.356]  Okay, I wanted to say the name of the song again.
[01:56:04.356 --> 01:56:05.637]  All right.
[01:56:05.637 --> 01:56:08.759]  The Vivek Raviswani interview I did last night is coming up.
[01:56:08.759 --> 01:56:11.021]  We had a lot of clips, a lot of documents to it.
[01:56:11.021 --> 01:56:13.183]  It's almost like a documentary.
[01:56:13.183 --> 01:56:13.924]  And then...
[01:56:15.984 --> 01:56:22.672]  There's going to be Mike Adams and more in the fourth hour today in the War Room, 3 p.m.
[01:56:22.672 --> 01:56:27.877]  Central today with Harrison Smith filling in for the imprisoned Owen Schroer.
[01:56:27.877 --> 01:56:30.420]  But yes, we're in very, very, very trying times.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.163]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:56:33.163 --> 01:56:36.267]  And I'm going to come back and I'm going to go to Alan.
[01:56:38.126 --> 01:56:44.829]  And then I'm going to go to Elena, and I'll try to get to as many of these as I can.
[01:56:44.829 --> 01:56:47.971]  But I need to go to the Vivek Ramaswamy interview, because that fills up the rest of the hour.
[01:56:47.971 --> 01:56:50.012]  So we'll have five more minutes when we come back.
[01:56:50.012 --> 01:56:52.053]  But yeah, X2's back in stock.
[01:56:52.053 --> 01:56:53.254]  It's the purest iodine out there.
[01:56:53.254 --> 01:56:54.674]  It's an incredible thing for your body.
[01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:55.215]  25% off.
[01:56:55.215 --> 01:56:55.955]  Short-wind free shipping.
[01:56:55.955 --> 01:56:56.775]  Double paid for your points.
[01:56:56.775 --> 01:56:58.296]  Black Friday comes early.
[01:56:58.296 --> 01:56:58.856]  And that's it.
[01:57:00.273 --> 01:57:03.556]  Want to donate, you go to Infowars.com up there at the top and just donate.
[01:57:03.556 --> 01:57:09.862]  We have the whole Democratic Party, you know, spending $50 million the last few years suing us, trying to shut us down.
[01:57:09.862 --> 01:57:11.063]  Every dirty trick in the book.
[01:57:11.063 --> 01:57:12.224]  Every lie you can imagine.
[01:57:12.224 --> 01:57:15.827]  Just, I mean, I've seen how they lie and how they twist, and it'll give you a headache.
[01:57:17.014 --> 01:57:20.235]  So I don't even pay attention to that, the attacks on us.
[01:57:20.235 --> 01:57:23.055]  I just move forward, cover the news, cover the information.
[01:57:23.055 --> 01:57:30.217]  Because if I just whined all day, you know, about what's going on with me personally or InfoWars, the show would be worthless.
[01:57:30.217 --> 01:57:36.599]  They intend to attack us, so we just talk about the attack instead of the issues for everybody.
[01:57:36.599 --> 01:57:37.379]  It's like Owen.
[01:57:37.379 --> 01:57:43.060]  We can spend ten minutes a day on Owen, but if we spend the whole four hours, we lose the war.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:43.540]  Okay?
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:45.221]  And that's what I try to explain to people.
[01:57:45.221 --> 01:57:45.761]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:49.818 --> 01:57:52.940]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:58.384]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[01:57:58.384 --> 01:58:10.312]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iDot on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[01:58:10.312 --> 01:58:14.915]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iDot Conspiracy, you are insane.
[01:58:14.915 --> 01:58:16.016]  Get X2 now.
[01:58:16.016 --> 01:58:17.096]  It could be the last run ever.
[01:58:17.096 --> 01:58:18.277]  We get shut down.
[01:58:18.277 --> 01:58:19.138]  While you still can,

[01:58:37.562 --> 01:58:42.083]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family, but has the opposite effect.
[01:58:42.083 --> 01:58:45.784]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[01:58:45.784 --> 01:58:47.505]  X2, back in stock right now.
[01:58:47.505 --> 01:58:48.625]  Discount at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:49.265 --> 01:58:53.707]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[01:58:53.707 --> 01:58:57.608]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[01:58:57.608 --> 01:59:02.710]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:05.091]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:59:05.091 --> 01:59:07.092]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:59:07.092 --> 01:59:08.873]  You Nazi scum!
[01:59:08.873 --> 01:59:12.494]  Let's free the Patriots and defeat the globalist tech gear.
[01:59:13.951 --> 01:59:18.542]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[01:59:18.542 --> 01:59:20.286]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[01:59:28.735 --> 01:59:32.478]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[01:59:32.478 --> 01:59:35.260]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist.
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:39.302]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[01:59:39.302 --> 01:59:51.930]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:55.853]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:04.318 --> 02:00:06.241]  Mr. Ramaswamy, let me turn to you.
[02:00:06.241 --> 02:00:08.644]  Please make your case.
[02:00:08.644 --> 02:00:11.988]  Why should you be the nominee and not the former president?
[02:00:11.988 --> 02:00:14.831]  I think there's something deeper going on in the Republican Party here.
[02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:17.815]  And I am upset about what happened last night.
[02:00:17.815 --> 02:00:20.519]  We've become a party of losers at the end of the day.
[02:00:20.519 --> 02:00:22.741]  It's a cancer in the Republican establishment.
[02:00:23.362 --> 02:00:24.283]  Let's speak the truth.
[02:00:24.283 --> 02:00:33.389]  I mean, since Ronna McDaniel took over as chairwoman of the RNC in 2017, we have lost 2018, 2020, 2022, no red wave that never came.
[02:00:33.389 --> 02:00:36.931]  We got trounced last night in 2023.
[02:00:36.931 --> 02:00:40.234]  And I think that we have to have accountability in our party.
[02:00:40.234 --> 02:00:48.479]  For that matter, Ron, if you want to come on stage tonight, you want to look the GOP voters in the eye and tell them you resign, I will turn over my, yield my time to you.
[02:00:48.479 --> 02:00:51.602]  And frankly, look, the people there cheering for losing in the Republican Party.
[02:00:52.242 --> 02:00:53.964]  Think about who's moderating this debate.
[02:00:53.964 --> 02:00:57.327]  This should be Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and Elon Musk.
[02:00:57.327 --> 02:01:04.414]  We'd have ten times the viewership asking questions that GOP primary voters actually care about and bringing more people into our party.
[02:01:04.414 --> 02:01:11.800]  Do you think the Democrats, and we've got Christian Welker here, do you think the Democrats would actually hire Greg Gutfeld to host a Democratic debate?
[02:01:12.461 --> 02:01:13.622]  They wouldn't do it.
[02:01:13.622 --> 02:01:20.008]  And so the fact of the matter is, I mean, Christian, I'm going to use this time, because this is actually about you in the media and the corrupt media establishment.
[02:01:20.008 --> 02:01:29.037]  Ask you, the Trump-Russia collusion hoax that you pushed on this network for years, was that real or was that Hillary Clinton made up disinformation?
[02:01:29.037 --> 02:01:29.778]  Answer the question.
[02:01:29.778 --> 02:01:30.999]  Go.
[02:01:30.999 --> 02:01:34.623]  Mr. Roberts, this is how we get our country back.
[02:01:36.543 --> 02:01:45.870]  We need accountability, because this media rigged the 2016 election, they rigged the 2020 election with a Hunter Biden laptop story, and they're going to rig this election.
[02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:49.753]  Let me turn to Governor Christie.
[02:01:49.753 --> 02:01:56.338]  What happened on the night before the debate was the Republican Party nationally got trounced, and everybody... Destroyed.
[02:01:56.338 --> 02:01:56.899]  Kentucky.
[02:01:56.899 --> 02:01:57.859]  Totally destroyed.
[02:01:57.859 --> 02:01:58.440]  Virginia.
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:01:59.961]  I mean, Ohio.
[02:01:59.961 --> 02:02:02.723]  These are red states, okay?
[02:02:02.723 --> 02:02:03.744]  Kentucky and Ohio, certainly.
[02:02:04.864 --> 02:02:09.168]  And so, I'm walking in, this is the morning after that trouncing.
[02:02:09.168 --> 02:02:12.772]  This is the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.
[02:02:12.772 --> 02:02:14.553]  She's coming, she's like, hey, how are you?
[02:02:14.553 --> 02:02:15.975]  I'm like, I'll give you a handshake.
[02:02:15.975 --> 02:02:17.696]  She's like, how you doing?
[02:02:17.696 --> 02:02:19.959]  I said, not that well, given that last night didn't go very well.
[02:02:19.959 --> 02:02:20.900]  She's like, what happened last night?
[02:02:21.570 --> 02:02:22.311]  Like oblivious?
[02:02:22.311 --> 02:02:23.291]  Is she saying a joke?
[02:02:23.291 --> 02:02:23.872]  No, no, no.
[02:02:23.872 --> 02:02:26.534]  She's saying it almost angrily, right?
[02:02:26.534 --> 02:02:28.635]  Because I was like, the Latinx is ascending goals.
[02:02:28.635 --> 02:02:29.696]  She's challenging me.
[02:02:29.696 --> 02:02:31.718]  She says, well, what happened last night?
[02:02:31.718 --> 02:02:32.378]  Oh, OK.
[02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:33.219]  Like, what happened last night?
[02:02:33.219 --> 02:02:34.820]  I don't know what happened last night.
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:35.741]  Tell me what happened last night.
[02:02:35.741 --> 02:02:39.443]  And I'm just like, this is the person who's accountable for running the Republican Party.
[02:02:39.443 --> 02:02:40.284]  I said, who lost the election.
[02:02:40.284 --> 02:02:41.965]  She said, we have nothing to do with that.
[02:02:41.965 --> 02:02:42.265]  Really?
[02:02:42.265 --> 02:02:43.987]  I run the National Party.
[02:02:43.987 --> 02:02:44.707]  These are state races.
[02:02:44.707 --> 02:02:45.468]  We have nothing to do with that.
[02:02:46.821 --> 02:02:56.478]  So where's... and then starts to escalate her voice and says, I refuse to fall on the sword for this one.
[02:02:56.478 --> 02:02:58.682]  I refuse to fall on the sword for this one.
[02:02:58.682 --> 02:02:59.544]  This is not my fault.
[02:03:00.327 --> 02:03:02.548]  And it's like, okay, clearly she's been criticized.
[02:03:02.548 --> 02:03:05.050]  How many minutes before you hit the stage is this happening?
[02:03:05.050 --> 02:03:06.791]  Oh, this is like early, this is in the morning, right?
[02:03:06.791 --> 02:03:08.872]  Okay, like pre-game prep, yeah.
[02:03:08.872 --> 02:03:13.894]  You kind of go through, they show you where you're going to be standing, here's your microphone, so that's where this happens.
[02:03:13.894 --> 02:03:17.516]  So, it's not like I surprised her on the stage, alright?
[02:03:17.516 --> 02:03:18.637]  She knew where I'm at on this.
[02:03:18.637 --> 02:03:20.478]  She had already had a long morning with this topic.
[02:03:20.738 --> 02:03:22.119]  Oh, of course, and should!
[02:03:22.119 --> 02:03:23.440]  I mean, 2018?
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.161]  Loss.
[02:03:24.161 --> 02:03:24.621]  2020?
[02:03:24.621 --> 02:03:25.402]  Loss.
[02:03:25.402 --> 02:03:25.542]  2022?
[02:03:25.542 --> 02:03:27.163]  No red wave.
[02:03:27.163 --> 02:03:27.183]  2023?
[02:03:27.183 --> 02:03:28.324]  Trouncing.
[02:03:28.324 --> 02:03:30.245]  Total drubbing for the Republican Party.
[02:03:30.245 --> 02:03:33.608]  This is the individual who's the national chairwoman.
[02:03:33.608 --> 02:03:35.690]  She runs the entire Republican National Committee.
[02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:36.630]  Where's the accountability?
[02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:42.495]  So I get on stage, and you're getting some, like, you know, standard, you know, beaten, dead old horse Donald Trump question.
[02:03:42.495 --> 02:03:43.235]  I said, forget that.
[02:03:43.235 --> 02:03:48.980]  Let's talk about what happened last night, because the last two elections he's been out, Republicans have gotten trounced for different reasons, so stop blaming
[02:03:50.441 --> 02:03:51.822]  The boogeyman.
[02:03:51.822 --> 02:03:55.083]  There's an accountability problem within the Republican Party.
[02:03:55.083 --> 02:04:10.411]  And so, so I say on stage that Ronna McDaniel, if she wanted to come up on stage, and I meant it, if she did want to come up on stage, you know, debate stage time is valuable, but I would still yield my time to her if she wants to use the microphone, look the American people in the eye and say she resigns, which would be good for the Republican Party.
[02:04:10.411 --> 02:04:12.372]  And I believe she should resign.
[02:04:12.372 --> 02:04:13.192]  So what does she say?
[02:04:13.192 --> 02:04:17.895]  So then the press reports, there's people apparently sitting in her row or behind her or in front of her where she is.
[02:04:18.834 --> 02:04:25.632]  Think about this, the neutral arbiter of the Republican National Committee, later in the debate, when I'm sparring with other candidates, booing when I'm speaking.
[02:04:26.556 --> 02:04:29.678]  Clapping against other candidates when they're speaking against me.
[02:04:29.678 --> 02:04:30.639]  She was booing?
[02:04:30.639 --> 02:04:31.380]  Who was booing?
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:33.862]  She's booing me at other points in the debate.
[02:04:33.862 --> 02:04:37.464]  And I don't care about that, but think about your dereliction of duty.
[02:04:37.464 --> 02:04:43.689]  You're supposedly the neutral arbiter of the entire National Republican Party hosting a debate.
[02:04:43.689 --> 02:04:47.472]  It's like a referee cheering in the middle of a game between two teams.
[02:04:47.472 --> 02:04:49.033]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:04:49.033 --> 02:04:55.598]  If the referee is booing or hollering in favor of one team or the other, that's what that looks like if she's the arbiter.
[02:04:59.699 --> 02:05:19.393]  Normally Christmas is our biggest sale of the year, but because of supply chain breakdowns and other issues, this is our biggest sale because finally almost all of our best-selling products are finally back in stock, including sold out for more than a year, X2, the only true nascent iodine out there, is finally back.

[02:06:01.162 --> 02:06:02.103]  Please make your case.
[02:06:02.103 --> 02:06:06.906]  Why should you be the nominee and not the former president?
[02:06:06.906 --> 02:06:09.748]  I think there's something deeper going on in the Republican Party here.
[02:06:09.748 --> 02:06:12.710]  And I am upset about what happened last night.
[02:06:12.710 --> 02:06:15.512]  We've become a party of losers at the end of the day.
[02:06:15.512 --> 02:06:17.654]  Is it cancer in the Republican establishment?
[02:06:18.234 --> 02:06:19.194]  Let's speak the truth.
[02:06:19.194 --> 02:06:28.276]  I mean, since Ronna McDaniel took over as chairwoman of the RNC in 2017, we have lost 2018, 2020, 2022, no red wave that never came.
[02:06:28.276 --> 02:06:31.816]  We got trounced last night in 2023.
[02:06:31.816 --> 02:06:35.117]  And I think that we have to have accountability in our party.
[02:06:35.117 --> 02:06:43.358]  For that matter, Ron, if you want to come on stage tonight, you want to look the GOP voters in the eye and tell them you resign, I will turn over my yield, my time to you.
[02:06:43.358 --> 02:06:46.479]  And frankly, look, the people they're cheering for losing in the Republican Party.
[02:06:47.139 --> 02:06:48.861]  Think about who's moderating this debate.
[02:06:48.861 --> 02:06:52.204]  This should be Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and Elon Musk.
[02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:59.391]  We'd have ten times the viewership asking questions that GOP primary voters actually care about and bringing more people into our party.
[02:06:59.391 --> 02:07:06.717]  Getting the Democrats, and we've got Christian Welker here, getting the Democrats would actually hire Greg Gutfeld to host a Democratic debate.
[02:07:07.358 --> 02:07:08.519]  They wouldn't do it.
[02:07:08.519 --> 02:07:14.903]  And so the fact of the matter is, I mean, Christian, I'm going to use this time, because this is actually about you in the media and the corrupt media establishment.
[02:07:14.903 --> 02:07:19.546]  Ask you the Trump-Russia collusion hoax that you pushed on this network for years.
[02:07:19.546 --> 02:07:23.928]  Was that real, or was that Hillary Clinton made up disinformation?
[02:07:23.928 --> 02:07:24.669]  Answer the question.
[02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:25.649]  Go!
[02:07:25.649 --> 02:07:28.691]  This is how we get our country back.
[02:07:31.457 --> 02:07:35.399]  We need accountability because this media rigged the 2016 election.
[02:07:35.399 --> 02:07:38.241]  They rigged the 2020 election with the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:07:38.241 --> 02:07:39.182]  Mr. Ramaswamy, your time is up.
[02:07:39.182 --> 02:07:40.382]  Let me turn to Governor Christie.
[02:07:56.861 --> 02:08:01.124]  It's Tuesday, November 21st, 2023.
[02:08:01.124 --> 02:08:06.587]  And I got to say the smartest guy in the Republican and Democratic field is here.
[02:08:06.587 --> 02:08:08.908]  Trump's a man of steel, a great patriot, incredible.
[02:08:08.908 --> 02:08:13.171]  But visit Rameshwani at the Republican debate a few weeks ago.
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:14.820]  We're good to go.
[02:08:28.945 --> 02:08:34.068]  We're going to intersperse this with clips from the debate and kind of a Vivek Ramaswamy's greatest hits.
[02:08:34.068 --> 02:08:40.031]  I want him to hit whatever he wants up front right now, currently on Tuesday, November 21st.
[02:08:40.031 --> 02:08:47.095]  But then I also want him to just talk about what else he would have said at the debate where he already totally dominated if they weren't cutting him off.
[02:08:47.095 --> 02:08:50.998]  So Vivek, congratulations on the incredible work you're doing.
[02:08:50.998 --> 02:08:53.959]  You're definitely setting brush fires in the minds of men and women.
[02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.881]  So I'm going to just try to shut up for the next 20 minutes.
[02:08:55.881 --> 02:08:56.441]  You've got the floor.
[02:08:58.055 --> 02:08:58.855]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:08:58.855 --> 02:09:03.597]  I think that I will call out the corruption in the Democratic establishment.
[02:09:03.597 --> 02:09:05.417]  In some ways, that's too easy.
[02:09:05.417 --> 02:09:09.978]  Biden has sold off our foreign policy to make his own family rich.
[02:09:09.978 --> 02:09:18.921]  The $5 million bribe paid to Hunter Biden by Ukraine is the reason why we're sending $200 billion of our taxpayer money to Ukraine.
[02:09:18.921 --> 02:09:21.361]  So I'll call out that corruption.
[02:09:21.361 --> 02:09:24.462]  I'll call out the corruption in the media establishment.
[02:09:24.462 --> 02:09:26.683]  Frankly, Kristen Welker from NBC News
[02:09:27.165 --> 02:09:43.755]  Who the RNC hired to run that last debate has been pushing the Trump-Russia collusion hoax for years, has been pushing the idea of the Hunter Biden laptop story being Russian misinformation for years without a shred of accountability.
[02:09:43.755 --> 02:09:51.140]  Well, my view is that we need to hold them accountable, but nobody else in the Republican Party has had the spine or ability to do it.
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:53.341]  So I did that on that debate stage.
[02:09:53.341 --> 02:09:53.922]  But you know what?
[02:09:53.922 --> 02:09:56.043]  I can't hold the Democrats accountable.
[02:09:56.573 --> 02:10:04.276]  And I can't hold the mainstream media accountable with credibility if I'm not also speaking truth about the Republican Party.
[02:10:04.276 --> 02:10:07.538]  And so, the Republican Party deserves accountability as well.
[02:10:07.538 --> 02:10:15.341]  You got Ronna McRomney-McDaniel, who has taken over the RNC in 2017, after which we lose 2018 and disasters in 2020, 2022, 2023.
[02:10:15.341 --> 02:10:18.263]  How many more times do you need to learn the same lesson before you say,
[02:10:25.874 --> 02:10:27.755]  Time to get the personnel.
[02:10:27.755 --> 02:10:33.740]  And so I called for accountability with respect to her failures as well, saying she needed to be fired.
[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.240]  And you know what?
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:40.505]  I would call her up on the debate stage to look the American voters in the eye and tell them that she resigns as well.
[02:10:40.505 --> 02:10:47.870]  So whether it's the Democrats, the Republicans, or the media, we need to start speaking the truth again in this country.
[02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:50.913]  And in many cases, they just continually prove my point.
[02:10:50.913 --> 02:10:52.334]  Ronna McDaniel, what did she say?
[02:10:52.334 --> 02:10:55.116]  Literally during the debate, she's booing me.
[02:10:55.876 --> 02:11:03.478]  And then according to press reports of what she was sitting near the third row, is actively booing while I'm speaking during other parts of the debate.
[02:11:03.478 --> 02:11:11.920]  And then says that I am not going to get another cent of funding from the RNC as though it was her money in the first place.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:17.321]  It's like a squatter in a rent-controlled apartment who ends up thinking they own the place.
[02:11:17.321 --> 02:11:19.462]  It's time to evict.
[02:11:19.462 --> 02:11:23.763]  And so this is what's broken, Alex, is the real divide in our country.
[02:11:23.763 --> 02:11:25.363]  It's not between black and white.
[02:11:26.064 --> 02:11:28.906]  It's not even between Republicans and Democrats.
[02:11:28.906 --> 02:11:34.169]  The Republican Party sometimes behaves like it's a subsidiary of the Democratic Party.
[02:11:34.169 --> 02:11:42.475]  The real divide in this country is between the managerial class, the bureaucrats, both in the public and private sector.
[02:11:42.475 --> 02:11:47.198]  That's what I call the swamp not just in government but outside of government.
[02:11:47.198 --> 02:11:50.420]  Between that swamp and the everyday citizens.
[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:53.102]  They're trying to impose on us the Great Reset, where they
[02:11:53.607 --> 02:12:01.714]  Dissolve the boundaries between the public and private sector, between companies and the government, between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, for that matter.
[02:12:01.714 --> 02:12:07.098]  Well, what we're standing up for is what I call the Great Uprising, where we say hell no in response to that.
[02:12:07.098 --> 02:12:17.807]  We, the people, sort out our differences through free speech and open debate in the public square, where every citizen's voice and vote counts equally.
[02:12:18.482 --> 02:12:19.984]  That's who we are as Americans.
[02:12:33.482 --> 02:12:35.123]  You just said it.
[02:12:35.123 --> 02:12:39.265]  NBC News, Fox, all of them, CNN, they're squatters.
[02:12:39.265 --> 02:12:41.287]  They just expect this.
[02:12:41.287 --> 02:12:48.371]  Why would the Republicans go and want an establishment dead network when I was on Steven Crowder that night?
[02:12:49.011 --> 02:12:54.014]  It had more viewers, over 2 million viewers, live than they had on that whole show.
[02:12:54.014 --> 02:12:56.376]  And you knew that even before the numbers came out.
[02:12:56.376 --> 02:13:01.039]  You said, why is it this on Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or Elon Musk?
[02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:02.820]  The Republicans can't be that dumb.
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:05.061]  They're propping up the old system.
[02:13:05.061 --> 02:13:11.305]  And you're a symbol of the new system, the new renaissance, the relaunch of America, 1776 Part 2.
[02:13:11.305 --> 02:13:13.967]  And you literally called them out and said, you're a fraud.
[02:13:13.967 --> 02:13:16.789]  Do you want to apologize as the corporate media
[02:13:17.449 --> 02:13:18.649]  That has lied to us.
[02:13:18.649 --> 02:13:26.151]  And if the Republicans would just do what you've done, they would take the country by storm, legally and lawfully, but they won't.
[02:13:26.151 --> 02:13:28.111]  So are they that dumb?
[02:13:28.111 --> 02:13:29.232]  Or are they blackmailed?
[02:13:29.232 --> 02:13:31.732]  Or are they afraid of the Justice Department, Vivek Ramaswamy?
[02:13:31.732 --> 02:13:33.593]  Why won't they figure it out?
[02:13:33.593 --> 02:13:37.534]  It comes down to one factor, Alex.
[02:13:37.534 --> 02:13:38.634]  Money.
[02:13:38.634 --> 02:13:39.934]  That's the answer.
[02:13:39.934 --> 02:13:42.935]  Money is the mother's milk of modern politics.
[02:13:42.935 --> 02:13:44.035]  And you see, I'm an outsider.
[02:13:44.628 --> 02:13:45.409]  I'm a businessman.
[02:13:45.409 --> 02:13:46.189]  I'm not a politician.
[02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:48.491]  I've learned a lot this year, though.
[02:13:48.491 --> 02:13:54.897]  Every single politician in both political parties dance to the tune of their biggest donor.
[02:13:54.897 --> 02:13:56.839]  That's the hard reality.
[02:13:56.839 --> 02:14:02.844]  Now, in my case, that biggest donor is me, which is why I'm able to speak the truth without being dependent on them.
[02:14:02.844 --> 02:14:11.271]  But the answer comes down to the same people who are pulling the strings in the Democratic Party, the same kind of people pulling the strings in the Republican Party as well.
[02:14:11.969 --> 02:14:15.551]  It is old school, ancient form of corruption.
[02:14:15.551 --> 02:14:16.771]  That's the answer.
[02:14:16.771 --> 02:14:24.735]  And the Republican Party, it's funny, Ronna McDaniel, she's going on with Kristen Welker later that Sunday on Beat the Press after I excoriated and torched both of them.
[02:14:24.735 --> 02:14:26.997]  They were on a mutual therapy session.
[02:14:26.997 --> 02:14:31.899]  It's really interesting that this is the network and this is the anchor at that network.
[02:14:32.526 --> 02:14:36.167]  Who has been pushing the Trump-Russia collusion hoax.
[02:14:36.167 --> 02:14:38.068]  That was the first election that was stolen.
[02:14:38.068 --> 02:14:39.568]  The 2016 election.
[02:14:39.568 --> 02:14:41.169]  The one where Trump wasn't allowed to govern.
[02:14:41.169 --> 02:14:41.429]  Why?
[02:14:41.429 --> 02:14:47.050]  Because of that particular part of the mainstream media especially pushing that hoax.
[02:14:47.050 --> 02:14:48.651]  And the lies they've pushed ever since.
[02:14:48.651 --> 02:14:50.631]  From the origin of COVID-19.
[02:14:50.631 --> 02:14:52.192]  All the way to the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:14:52.192 --> 02:14:55.113]  All the way now to how our money's being spent in Ukraine.
[02:14:55.113 --> 02:14:59.994]  That's the people who the Republican National Committee hires to ask questions.
[02:15:00.626 --> 02:15:04.649]  On behalf of GOP primary voters, it's a joke.
[02:15:04.649 --> 02:15:09.553]  So right now we have a party that is badly out of touch with its own base.
[02:15:09.553 --> 02:15:13.897]  It comes down to the corrupting influence of money in politics.
[02:15:13.897 --> 02:15:15.558]  And I think we need to fix it.
[02:15:15.558 --> 02:15:25.646]  But the sad part is, Alex, is right now it's... I wish it wasn't the case that only self-made wealthy people were the ones that could run for president and stand for the right values.
[02:15:25.646 --> 02:15:30.130]  But until we fix this system, the reality is I'm in a position to do it because
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:32.381]  I've been able to achieve success in this country.
[02:15:32.381 --> 02:15:34.003]  I've lived the American dream.
[02:15:34.003 --> 02:15:40.027]  Now I want to give back to this country in a way that allows our kids to live that same dream.
[02:15:40.027 --> 02:15:51.515]  You are definitely a maverick in the Trumpian model, but I have to say, even more informed, what do you make of the anti-globalist Javier Mille winning and what he's about to do?
[02:15:51.515 --> 02:15:55.358]  That's another bellwether of the people are hungry, hungry for freedom.
[02:15:58.510 --> 02:16:02.932]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Bros.
[02:16:02.932 --> 02:16:06.834]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[02:16:06.834 --> 02:16:11.456]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[02:16:11.456 --> 02:16:14.037]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!

[02:16:16.318 --> 02:16:19.119]  You Nazi scum!
[02:16:19.119 --> 02:16:21.780]  Let's free the Patriots and defeat the globalist tech gear!
[02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:27.785]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[02:16:27.785 --> 02:16:29.531]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[02:16:37.970 --> 02:16:41.713]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[02:16:41.713 --> 02:16:42.953]  Oh, big deal.
[02:16:42.953 --> 02:16:44.474]  I'm taking you down, rapist.
[02:16:44.474 --> 02:16:48.537]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.

[02:19:03.046 --> 02:19:08.210]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:19:08.210 --> 02:19:11.673]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:19:11.673 --> 02:19:12.754]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:19:12.754 --> 02:19:17.218]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[02:19:17.218 --> 02:19:23.082]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[02:19:23.823 --> 02:19:30.829]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the Globalists and launching the next Great Renaissance.
[02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:34.471]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[02:19:34.471 --> 02:19:38.114]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book.
[02:19:38.114 --> 02:19:42.498]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[02:19:42.498 --> 02:19:46.481]  This is a cultural fight against the Globalists and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:19:46.481 --> 02:19:50.024]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now.
[02:19:50.524 --> 02:19:51.765]  Rhythm and sport!

[02:20:21.258 --> 02:20:22.959]  Ministry of Public Works.

[02:20:24.079 --> 02:20:24.959]  Even if you resist.
[02:20:24.959 --> 02:20:29.061]  Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation.
[02:20:29.061 --> 02:20:29.161]  Out!
[02:20:29.161 --> 02:20:31.641]  Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security.

[02:20:32.061 --> 02:20:33.002]  Ministry of Education.

[02:20:33.102 --> 02:20:34.122]  Ministry of Transport.

[02:20:41.348 --> 02:20:46.673]  Ministry of Social Development, out!
[02:20:46.673 --> 02:20:48.794]  The work of politics is over.
[02:20:48.794 --> 02:20:49.955]  Long live freedom, damn it!
[02:20:49.955 --> 02:20:50.336]  It seems so.
[02:20:50.336 --> 02:21:04.988]  Good evening to everyone, to everyone who is here, to those who are
[02:21:10.268 --> 02:21:17.450]  What do you make of the anti-globalist Javier Mille winning and what he's about to do?
[02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:21.332]  That's another bellwether of the people are hungry, hungry for freedom.
[02:21:40.945 --> 02:21:47.171]  Absolutely, and this is a transnational movement, Alex, right now, so I'm really happy to see Javier take it over.
[02:21:47.171 --> 02:21:55.198]  This is a guy who literally shares, I think, the same vision for his country's bureaucracy as I do for the bureaucracy in our own country.
[02:21:55.198 --> 02:21:56.039]  Shut.
[02:21:56.039 --> 02:21:56.539]  It.
[02:21:56.539 --> 02:21:57.460]  Down.
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:00.903]  He does not believe in incremental reform.
[02:22:00.903 --> 02:22:07.209]  He believes in, really, a form of revolution, peaceful through the electoral process, but
[02:22:07.631 --> 02:22:10.413]  The kind of revival of the American Revolution.
[02:22:10.413 --> 02:22:15.117]  That's what I want to bring in this country's spirit and the ideals of the American Revolution.
[02:22:15.117 --> 02:22:17.659]  I see him doing a version of that in Argentina.
[02:22:17.659 --> 02:22:18.820]  This is a country that needs it.
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:22.903]  I mean, Argentina has 125% year-over-year inflation.
[02:22:22.903 --> 02:22:30.528]  The country that used to be top 10 economically, now it's floundering because of effective quasi-socialists that have run that country forever.
[02:22:30.528 --> 02:22:33.571]  Well, this is a guy who's saying hell no to the vision of the Great Reset.
[02:22:34.198 --> 02:22:50.352]  He's on the side of the Great Uprising, says that we, the people, in his country, are the ones that are actually going to be the ones... And look at Bukele and El Salvador, and they elected a patriot in Italy, and Sweden, and in... I mean, everywhere right now, populists are getting elected.
[02:22:50.352 --> 02:22:53.055]  Can you speak to that and what that symbolizes?
[02:22:53.055 --> 02:22:57.358]  Yeah, I think it symbolizes the fact that this isn't just about the United States of America.
[02:22:57.358 --> 02:22:59.260]  This isn't about just Republicans and Democrats.
[02:22:59.966 --> 02:23:01.907]  This is a transnational movement.
[02:23:01.907 --> 02:23:05.908]  You know, even in 1776, we had the American Revolution.
[02:23:05.908 --> 02:23:07.509]  1789, you got the French Revolution.
[02:23:07.509 --> 02:23:12.571]  Now, theirs went sideways because they didn't do some things the right way that we did in this country.
[02:23:12.571 --> 02:23:21.034]  But the fact of the matter is, when freedom things, it doesn't limit itself to just one nation when it happens.
[02:23:21.034 --> 02:23:26.976]  It's the same international forces, the old monarchy in the old world, that impeded
[02:23:27.501 --> 02:23:30.642]  Free citizens and free people on both sides of the Atlantic.
[02:23:30.642 --> 02:23:36.643]  Well, the same thing is happening today from the United States to Argentina to parts of Western Europe.
[02:23:36.643 --> 02:23:41.243]  Even if you look at the truckers in Canada a couple years ago before they wiped their bank accounts clean.
[02:23:41.243 --> 02:23:42.764]  This is something that's bigger.
[02:23:42.764 --> 02:23:53.986]  We live in a modern 1776 moment, Alex, in a good way and through this time in a peaceful way through the electoral process in Argentina this year and in our country next year.
[02:23:53.986 --> 02:23:55.426]  We're going to revive
[02:23:56.044 --> 02:23:58.485]  The spirit that this country was founded on.
[02:23:58.485 --> 02:24:02.665]  We the people create a government that's accountable to us, not the other way around.
[02:24:02.665 --> 02:24:11.287]  And Vivek, as you know, as you know, Newtonian physics, every action is an opposite reaction, an equal reaction.
[02:24:11.287 --> 02:24:18.129]  Just like there's the WUF and Black Rock with its global tyranny, people instinctively in an organic level all over the world
[02:24:18.789 --> 02:24:19.449]  Yes it is.
[02:24:19.449 --> 02:24:20.489]  It's a very exciting time to be alive.
[02:24:20.489 --> 02:24:22.550]  I think that imagine if you were alive in the spring of 1776.
[02:24:47.850 --> 02:24:53.675]  Thomas Jefferson, he was 33 years old when he signed that Declaration of Independence.
[02:24:53.675 --> 02:24:55.197]  And that's why I'm also in this, Alex.
[02:24:55.197 --> 02:25:05.686]  I think it's going to take somebody with fresh legs, somebody whose best days in life are still yet ahead, to see a country whose best days can still be ahead.
[02:25:05.686 --> 02:25:07.328]  That's what Thomas Jefferson saw.
[02:25:07.328 --> 02:25:09.349]  That's what I see in this country.
[02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:13.253]  And when you think about these great revivals, the revolutions, the revivals in history,
[02:25:14.016 --> 02:25:20.483]  It's always been people of the next generation who are leading the way, and so I feel some sense of responsibility to do it.
[02:25:20.483 --> 02:25:23.245]  Not because it's convenient for my family, it's not.
[02:25:23.245 --> 02:25:27.450]  But because if we don't step up and do it, I don't think anybody is.
[02:25:27.450 --> 02:25:33.876]  We each look ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves, how are we going to make the best use of our own God-given talents?
[02:25:34.474 --> 02:25:38.118]  Well, this is how we're going to do it to revive this country, and I'm feeling really good.
[02:25:38.118 --> 02:25:40.860]  My heart, my gut instinct says we're going to be successful in reviving this.
[02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:42.302]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:25:42.302 --> 02:25:44.784]  Because you're not a hyphenated American, you're an American.
[02:25:44.784 --> 02:25:49.429]  Just like, I've got an English last name, I'm not an English-American, I'm an American.
[02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:53.793]  But I know, because I run into him all over the streets of Austin, all over the country, and I see the numbers.
[02:25:54.614 --> 02:26:03.461]  What is the experience of people of Indian heritage, statistically, that are so pro-Trump, so free market, so in the revolution?
[02:26:03.461 --> 02:26:10.546]  I know you're an American, born here, raised here, you're an American, but you're also an Indian American.
[02:26:10.546 --> 02:26:14.409]  What's up with the Indians really getting it?
[02:26:14.409 --> 02:26:17.752]  Well, here's the thing is, they believe in merit.
[02:26:17.752 --> 02:26:20.334]  I mean, I'm talking about like my extended family members, everybody else.
[02:26:20.334 --> 02:26:23.236]  We can't speak for everybody, but in general, the people come to this country,
[02:26:23.735 --> 02:26:25.076]  We're of Indian origin.
[02:26:25.076 --> 02:26:44.206]  They've left a country where there's kinds of affirmative action and a lot of other broken systems to say, I want to go to a country that values meritocracy, where you get ahead, not on the color of your skin, but on the content of your character, where you get ahead through your own hard work and commitment and dedication without anybody standing in your way.
[02:26:44.206 --> 02:26:49.649]  Yes, you know, family is the foundation of a great society, and we're not going to apologize for that.
[02:26:49.649 --> 02:26:51.930]  Those are values that I wish
[02:26:52.617 --> 02:26:59.941]  More Indian Americans learned, were better embodied by our pro-American movement, the America First Movement, than the Democrat Party.
[02:26:59.941 --> 02:27:19.611]  So the sad truth is many of them did go for Democrats for the last 15 to 20 years, but I'm trying to teach immigrants from every country that if you stand for family values, you stand for actual meritocracy in this country, you don't want somebody else getting in your way of achieving the maximum of your God-given potential, then actually there's a better way to do this.
[02:27:20.645 --> 02:27:25.949]  I don't even talk about Republicans and Democrats that much, Alex, because I do think the Republican Party is badly broken.
[02:27:25.949 --> 02:27:27.670]  Of course, the Democrats are worse.
[02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:31.473]  But I talk about this as to whether or not you're pro-American or anti-American.
[02:27:31.473 --> 02:27:35.676]  And if you're pro-American and you stand for the values and the ideals of the American Revolution,
[02:27:36.363 --> 02:27:37.404]  Then we're on the same team.
[02:27:37.404 --> 02:27:37.904]  Absolutely.
[02:27:37.904 --> 02:27:38.925]  Let me ask you this.
[02:27:38.925 --> 02:27:41.367]  What did you make of the bowing down to Xi Jinping?
[02:27:41.367 --> 02:27:49.512]  We love the Chinese people, great people, but Xi Jinping running slave camps, the most tyrannical country really in world history for numbers raw.
[02:27:49.512 --> 02:27:50.873]  I don't think that's debatable.
[02:27:50.873 --> 02:27:56.837]  What did you make of them blocking Elon Musk out of the meeting and then them just prostrating themselves before him?
[02:27:56.837 --> 02:27:59.099]  I thought that was pretty disgusting.
[02:27:59.099 --> 02:28:00.000]  Oh, it's pretty disgusting.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:00.460]  Absolutely.
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:03.182]  I mean, yeah, this is the real master for
[02:28:03.806 --> 02:28:10.151]  So many American companies, Tim Cook or Larry Fink, they're Xi Jinping's circus monkeys.
[02:28:10.151 --> 02:28:14.215]  Xi will say jump, they will ask how high, because it comes down to money.
[02:28:14.215 --> 02:28:31.990]  Xi says you don't get to enter the Chinese market if you criticize the CCP, but Xi Jinping will roll out the red carpet if those same companies, from BlackRock to Apple, criticize the United States or apply emissions caps here in the United States, even if they don't apply those same emissions caps in China.
[02:28:32.506 --> 02:28:41.169]  So I think we thought, Alex, we made a mistake in this country, where we thought we could use our money to get them to be more like us.
[02:28:41.169 --> 02:28:47.171]  Instead, what China realized is they could use access to their market, their money, to get us to be more like them.
[02:28:47.171 --> 02:28:53.433]  I totally agree, and look how they banned Jon Stewart's show that was successful because he criticized E.G.
[02:28:53.433 --> 02:28:55.393]  Ping and the Uyghur slaves.
[02:28:55.393 --> 02:28:57.714]  I mean, it's not Alex Jones being censored, now it's Jon Stewart.
[02:28:58.493 --> 02:29:04.697]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[02:29:04.697 --> 02:29:09.380]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:13.543]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[02:29:15.204 --> 02:29:18.245]  So many people have serious issues.
[02:29:18.245 --> 02:29:19.806]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[02:29:19.806 --> 02:29:25.768]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[02:29:25.768 --> 02:29:31.790]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:34.551]  But this is pure atomic certified
[02:29:36.443 --> 02:29:37.663]  I don't know.
[02:29:58.269 --> 02:30:02.795]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned!

[02:31:58.061 --> 02:32:03.823]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[02:32:03.823 --> 02:32:08.644]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:32:08.644 --> 02:32:11.665]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:32:11.665 --> 02:32:21.248]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[02:33:10.032 --> 02:33:13.833]  What would you do as president with the China situation?
[02:33:15.029 --> 02:33:19.130]  So I would sit across the table from Xi Jinping, we'd have a very different meeting than the one by Ted.
[02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:21.551]  I will tell him, you will not buy land in this country.
[02:33:21.551 --> 02:33:24.332]  You will not donate to universities in this country.
[02:33:24.332 --> 02:33:24.712]  U.S.
[02:33:24.712 --> 02:33:29.294]  companies will no longer expand or be allowed to expand into the Chinese market.
[02:33:29.294 --> 02:33:43.159]  We'll kick you out of the WTO, and you will be held accountable financially using every financial lever we have available, including our national debt, for unleashing hell on the world with the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:33:43.159 --> 02:33:43.779]  And we're not going to
[02:33:44.232 --> 02:33:48.537]  Do business with China until China's playing by the same set of rules.
[02:33:48.537 --> 02:33:54.624]  No intellectual property theft, no data theft, no turning our companies into lobbying pawns.
[02:33:54.624 --> 02:33:55.465]  That's the hard answer.
[02:33:56.590 --> 02:33:59.331]  Wow, in the time we have left, I don't want you to be able to make any other key points you want.
[02:33:59.331 --> 02:34:01.192]  We're so honored to have you.
[02:34:01.192 --> 02:34:04.874]  Look, they could assassinate Trump, God forbid, whatever.
[02:34:04.874 --> 02:34:07.716]  I support Trump, and I think he's a good guy in many ways.
[02:34:07.716 --> 02:34:10.777]  I think, quite frankly, issue-wise, you're more informed than Trump.
[02:34:10.777 --> 02:34:12.198]  I'm just being honest.
[02:34:12.198 --> 02:34:14.619]  I know he hears about the show, he watches it, he gets mad.
[02:34:14.619 --> 02:34:15.080]  That's great.
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:18.181]  Because we just want to encourage him to be even better.
[02:34:18.181 --> 02:34:26.786]  But I'm really impressed overall, and I had good feelings about you a year ago, six months ago, read your book before you ran, one of your books before you ran.
[02:34:26.786 --> 02:34:28.707]  But I want to throw a wild card at you.
[02:34:28.707 --> 02:34:30.488]  I like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:34:30.488 --> 02:34:33.910]  I know they killed his dad in front of him, killed his uncle on TV in front of him.
[02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:34.830]  I want to think he's one of us.
[02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:39.913]  But when you look at his record of wanting carbon taxes and arrest people that question global warming and
[02:34:40.714 --> 02:34:41.094]  I don't know.
[02:35:00.854 --> 02:35:11.522]  But if you were running third party, I'm not saying do that because you're not on the ballot and it's not going to happen, but I would have a real problem who I was going to vote for if it was Vivek Ramaswamy, third party, or Trump.
[02:35:11.522 --> 02:35:13.584]  You know Biden's propped up as a fraud.
[02:35:13.584 --> 02:35:14.484]  Be honest here.
[02:35:14.484 --> 02:35:16.126]  What do you think of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
[02:35:16.126 --> 02:35:18.307]  Because I respect your opinion.
[02:35:18.307 --> 02:35:24.012]  Yeah, so I think he is... I would like to think of it, Alex, as he's going through an evolution, right?
[02:35:24.012 --> 02:35:25.453]  We're all human beings, right?
[02:35:25.453 --> 02:35:28.355]  So I would like to give him some benefit of the doubt here.
[02:35:28.772 --> 02:35:33.114]  But I'm going to need hard proof from him that he has evolved his own position.
[02:35:33.114 --> 02:35:41.337]  We're human beings, we're allowed to change our mind, but him saying that if you're spreading climate disinformation you should be put in jail, that's a concern for me.
[02:35:41.337 --> 02:35:45.799]  Him coming out in favor of racial reparation, that's a concern for me.
[02:35:45.799 --> 02:35:57.684]  And so my view is, I give him a lot of credit for standing up to the orthodoxies of the Democratic Party, for otherwise standing for self-governance, standing against the weaponization of the financial system, and being against the war in Ukraine.
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:03.763]  I know from first-hand experiences, those are difficult positions to take, and I give a lot of credit for that.
[02:36:03.763 --> 02:36:24.933]  That being said, before I would consider him in any role on a cabinet in my administration, or even involved in any way, I'd need to make sure that his values on issues relating to free speech and not bending the knee to the climate religion, and I would say that his allergic reaction to the Second Amendment, I would want to spend some time with him, and I think I could persuade him.
[02:36:24.933 --> 02:36:27.414]  Actually, Alex, I think he needs somebody who's actually sitting with him.
[02:36:27.904 --> 02:36:30.386]  And actually debating him and persuading him.
[02:36:30.386 --> 02:36:34.668]  And then I think we can actually knock some sense into him on some of those other issues where he's been missing it.
[02:36:34.668 --> 02:36:36.630]  So I see a lot of potential there.
[02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:41.913]  But we're going to need to do some work in terms of, you know, I would say enlightening him on some issues where he might not actually have.
[02:36:41.913 --> 02:36:44.475]  Vivek, that is a perfect, perfect answer.
[02:36:44.475 --> 02:36:46.476]  I couldn't say it that well myself.
[02:36:46.476 --> 02:36:47.737]  That is exactly where I am.
[02:36:47.737 --> 02:36:50.318]  He needs to say who he is.
[02:36:50.318 --> 02:36:52.320]  Because he needs to put out, he needs to put a platform.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:53.581]  He's still discovering who he is.
[02:36:53.581 --> 02:36:55.942]  I think he's still discovering who he is is the truth, Alex.
[02:36:55.942 --> 02:36:57.163]  He needs to put a platform out.
[02:36:58.319 --> 02:36:59.160]  Yep.
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:00.621]  How do people find you?
[02:37:00.621 --> 02:37:04.044]  How do people get behind you?
[02:37:04.044 --> 02:37:09.849]  Because obviously the establishment hates you like they hate Trump, which is really the gold star example.
[02:37:09.849 --> 02:37:10.729]  We've got three minutes left.
[02:37:10.729 --> 02:37:12.351]  You've got to go.
[02:37:12.351 --> 02:37:14.032]  What else do you want to add to the viewers?
[02:37:14.032 --> 02:37:15.693]  What else do you want to add to the listeners?
[02:37:15.693 --> 02:37:18.255]  And then how do people get behind the campaign?
[02:37:18.255 --> 02:37:21.598]  I think one thing is go to FireRana.com.
[02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:24.300]  I made that after the Republican debate.
[02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:25.722]  Just put your name down on the list.
[02:37:25.722 --> 02:37:27.303]  It's not asking for money or anything else.
[02:37:27.833 --> 02:37:29.634]  Just say you want to fire Ronna McDaniel.
[02:37:29.634 --> 02:37:30.615]  She deserves to be fired.
[02:37:30.615 --> 02:37:32.576]  So go to fireronna.com.
[02:37:32.576 --> 02:37:33.757]  That's your name.
[02:37:33.757 --> 02:37:37.159]  Next one, sign the No to Neocons Pledge.
[02:37:37.159 --> 02:37:40.481]  Okay, I made that at notoneocons.com.
[02:37:40.481 --> 02:37:41.922]  Go there and say, you know what?
[02:37:41.922 --> 02:37:42.983]  The job of the U.S.
[02:37:42.983 --> 02:37:47.706]  policymakers is to look after the citizens of the United States of America.
[02:37:47.706 --> 02:37:48.706]  Period.
[02:37:48.706 --> 02:37:50.127]  And then if you like this campaign, great.
[02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:51.708]  Join us as a volunteer.
[02:37:51.708 --> 02:37:54.590]  I'll take donations, grassroots donations, even if it's a dollar.
[02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:56.712]  We're sending a signal to the establishment.
[02:37:56.712 --> 02:37:57.212]  That's great.
[02:37:57.819 --> 02:37:59.661]  Vivek2024.com.
[02:37:59.661 --> 02:38:01.162]  That's the website as well.
[02:38:01.162 --> 02:38:02.463]  But I'll tell you this, Alex.
[02:38:02.463 --> 02:38:03.764]  We're just getting warmed up.
[02:38:03.764 --> 02:38:11.751]  I'd rather speak the truth at every step and lose some election than to win by playing some political snakes and ladders.
[02:38:11.751 --> 02:38:16.995]  You know, we're doing this because we want everyone in this country to know what's true and what's right.
[02:38:16.995 --> 02:38:18.877]  I'm going to tell you who I am and what I stand for.
[02:38:18.877 --> 02:38:23.781]  It's your job to come out and support us if that's the vision you want to see for this country.
[02:38:23.781 --> 02:38:24.962]  But America first.
[02:38:24.962 --> 02:38:25.482]  I'll tell you this.
[02:38:25.482 --> 02:38:26.163]  It doesn't belong
[02:38:26.721 --> 02:38:31.007]  To Vivek Ramaswamy, it doesn't belong to Donald Trump, it doesn't belong to Alex Jones.
[02:38:31.007 --> 02:38:33.550]  It belongs to all of you, the people of this country.
[02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:37.375]  And that's what we've got to remember, is this movement is bigger than any one of us.
[02:38:37.375 --> 02:38:39.698]  That's how we're going to drive change on the scale of history.
[02:38:40.259 --> 02:38:43.181]  I'm going to do my part and I'm going to expect that you guys do yours.
[02:38:43.181 --> 02:38:44.701]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[02:38:44.701 --> 02:38:49.124]  And again, it's not selfish to say America first or family first.
[02:38:49.124 --> 02:38:55.607]  If we don't stand up for ourselves and have our own identity and our own jurisdiction, then we have nothing.
[02:38:55.607 --> 02:39:00.850]  So in two minutes that you got to go, you're on the debate stage, things you wish you would have said.
[02:39:00.850 --> 02:39:04.992]  I mean, literally it was torture to watch all the other candidates, Nikki Haley, all of them.
[02:39:04.992 --> 02:39:06.593]  It was like nails on a chalkboard.
[02:39:06.593 --> 02:39:07.494]  And then you were just like,
[02:39:08.234 --> 02:39:10.915]  A bright light in the middle of this darkness.
[02:39:10.915 --> 02:39:15.457]  In two minutes, what else would you have said, but they cut you off?
[02:39:15.457 --> 02:39:17.778]  Well, I would say some hard facts, right?
[02:39:17.778 --> 02:39:21.799]  It's no secret that I have a very different worldview than Nikki Haley, right?
[02:39:21.799 --> 02:39:24.200]  She's a globalist, I'm a nationalist.
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:27.242]  She believes in fighting foreign wars and she's bloodthirsty.
[02:39:27.242 --> 02:39:30.963]  I believe we should stay out of World War III and my moral obligation as the U.S.
[02:39:30.963 --> 02:39:31.723]  President is to U.S.
[02:39:31.723 --> 02:39:32.164]  citizens.
[02:39:32.164 --> 02:39:34.164]  But let's go through some hard facts.
[02:39:34.164 --> 02:39:37.946]  Just like I pointed out the Biden corruption, let's talk about how Nikki Haley,
[02:39:38.789 --> 02:39:41.410]  Left her time at the U.N.
[02:39:41.410 --> 02:39:42.970]  in debt.
[02:39:42.970 --> 02:39:45.290]  Swimming in personal debt.
[02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:49.011]  And then, starts a military contracting firm.
[02:39:49.011 --> 02:39:56.253]  And then, makes secretive speeches to foreign actors getting paid, sometimes seven figures speaking gig.
[02:39:56.253 --> 02:40:02.134]  And then, joins the board of Boeing, whose back she's scratched for years as South Carolina governor.
[02:40:02.134 --> 02:40:06.175]  And then, is now collecting corporate stock options while running for U.S.
[02:40:06.175 --> 02:40:06.615]  President.
[02:40:07.205 --> 02:40:09.987]  And now, just like Biden, is a multi-millionaire.
[02:40:09.987 --> 02:40:11.348]  That is corrupt.
[02:40:11.348 --> 02:40:13.330]  It's corrupt whether a Democrat does it.
[02:40:13.330 --> 02:40:15.591]  It's corrupt whether a Republican does it.
[02:40:15.591 --> 02:40:20.435]  These people will send your kids to die so they can put more money into their own bank account.
[02:40:20.435 --> 02:40:23.037]  Republican or Democrat alike, it doesn't matter.
[02:40:23.037 --> 02:40:26.239]  That's what I meant when I said it's Dick Cheney and three-inch heels.
[02:40:26.239 --> 02:40:29.102]  That's not what we deserve as the American people.
[02:40:29.102 --> 02:40:32.144]  No one like that should get within spitting distance of the White House.
[02:40:32.717 --> 02:40:34.759]  And so whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, I don't care.
[02:40:34.759 --> 02:40:38.122]  I'm going to call out the corruption the way we see it.
[02:40:38.122 --> 02:40:40.924]  And for me, it comes down not just to histrionics, Alex.
[02:40:40.924 --> 02:40:43.907]  It comes down to hard facts.
[02:40:43.907 --> 02:40:46.229]  And that's what it's going to guide me for the rest of this.
[02:40:46.229 --> 02:40:50.113]  And I think the truth, you speak the truth, good things are going to happen for our country.
[02:40:50.113 --> 02:40:54.897]  My one message to everybody is, say in public what you'll otherwise say in private.
[02:40:54.897 --> 02:40:58.040]  We've got this culture of fear where other Republicans and even the consultants
[02:40:58.615 --> 02:41:04.263]  Well, tell me not to say all of this because it's going to hurt me in some way in this election or otherwise.
[02:41:04.263 --> 02:41:05.484]  You can't think that way.
[02:41:05.484 --> 02:41:08.288]  You have to ask yourself, what is true?
[02:41:08.288 --> 02:41:09.690]  What will I say in private?
[02:41:09.690 --> 02:41:11.252]  Let me say that in public.
[02:41:11.252 --> 02:41:13.375]  That's what gives other people courage as well.
[02:41:13.973 --> 02:41:15.235]  That's what this campaign is about.
[02:41:30.857 --> 02:41:36.825]  They gave him a chance to roll over and he got more hardcore and then they totally tried to shut him down.
[02:41:36.825 --> 02:41:40.990]  That is the proof right there that you didn't back down.
[02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:44.635]  In fact, you doubled and tripled down.
[02:41:44.635 --> 02:41:46.057]  And so I know you gotta go, but just...
[02:41:46.952 --> 02:41:49.013]  A minute on Trump.
[02:41:49.013 --> 02:41:49.654]  People get confused.
[02:41:49.654 --> 02:41:51.535]  They go, well, I'm for Vivica or Trump.
[02:41:51.535 --> 02:41:57.058]  Regardless, you're a standard-bearer, like in the Roman legion here of the truth.
[02:41:57.058 --> 02:42:00.280]  And so, regardless, it doesn't matter.
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:01.481]  We should support both of you.
[02:42:01.481 --> 02:42:03.802]  But what is your gut level on Trump?
[02:42:03.802 --> 02:42:04.743]  It's backfired.
[02:42:04.743 --> 02:42:08.766]  He's 39 points ahead in Florida and DeSantis.
[02:42:08.766 --> 02:42:11.587]  He's dominating the field, 20 points ahead of Biden.
[02:42:11.587 --> 02:42:14.729]  What is your gut level on how this ends for Trump?
[02:42:14.729 --> 02:42:15.770]  Well, look, I think that
[02:42:16.286 --> 02:42:18.328]  I respect him, and he respects me.
[02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:20.790]  We have a good mutual relationship of trust.
[02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:29.717]  If he ends up the nominee, he will have my full, total support all in, and I expect the same from him if I'm the nominee.
[02:42:29.717 --> 02:42:32.440]  But I think we gotta think at the next level here.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:35.742]  The America First agenda, this should be the future of this country.
[02:42:35.742 --> 02:42:37.604]  It can't just be about one man.
[02:42:37.604 --> 02:42:40.586]  It has to be about all of us in this movement.
[02:42:40.586 --> 02:42:43.669]  And so, I will pardon him on day one, if I'm elected.
[02:42:44.173 --> 02:42:47.295]  If I'm elected, I'll take him as my top advisor for that first year.
[02:42:47.295 --> 02:42:49.237]  I want to know where the bodies are buried.
[02:42:49.237 --> 02:42:51.959]  The system has an anaphylactic reaction to him.
[02:42:51.959 --> 02:42:58.303]  There's a group of people in this country that has decided, by hell or high water, they will not let this man get near there again.
[02:42:58.303 --> 02:43:04.047]  So, my view is, I'm going to do my part in this, take our America First movement to the next level.
[02:43:04.047 --> 02:43:05.068]  I have fresh legs.
[02:43:05.068 --> 02:43:06.889]  I haven't yet been wounded in that war.
[02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:09.071]  I'm not going in naively, Alex.
[02:43:09.071 --> 02:43:12.073]  I know they're going to come for me when I'm in that White House as well, but that's okay.
[02:43:12.679 --> 02:43:15.221]  That's a sacrifice we need to make for this country.
[02:43:15.221 --> 02:43:17.603]  And that's the way I view the America First movement.
[02:43:17.603 --> 02:43:18.804]  Trump is a vehicle for it.
[02:43:18.804 --> 02:43:19.705]  He was a vehicle for it.
[02:43:19.705 --> 02:43:21.247]  Now I'm a vehicle for it.
[02:43:21.247 --> 02:43:22.308]  That's the way we're going to save the day.
[02:43:22.308 --> 02:43:25.350]  Alright, Vivek Rana Swamy, my gut tells me you're good.
[02:43:25.350 --> 02:43:27.012]  Intellectually, I know you're good.
[02:43:27.012 --> 02:43:30.114]  It's so good to know there are great men like you still in the world.
[02:43:30.114 --> 02:43:33.117]  Thank you so much for the time and Godspeed.
[02:43:33.117 --> 02:43:33.958]  Hope to talk to you soon.
[02:43:35.014 --> 02:43:35.655]  Let's do it again.
[02:43:35.655 --> 02:43:36.315]  Thank you, man.
[02:43:36.315 --> 02:43:37.236]  Thank you.
[02:43:37.236 --> 02:43:37.896]  All right, folks.
[02:43:37.896 --> 02:43:39.998]  There goes Vivek Ramaswamy.
[02:43:39.998 --> 02:43:41.018]  That guy's 100% real.
[02:43:41.018 --> 02:43:46.282]  And that's why they did whisper campaigns that he's a globalist and all this other crap.
[02:43:46.282 --> 02:43:48.984]  No, that guy's real and they're scared of him.
[02:43:48.984 --> 02:43:52.387]  And they're scared of Trump and they're scared of me because they're scared of you.
[02:43:52.387 --> 02:43:56.150]  And that was powerful.
[02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:58.912]  I mean, look, look, Elon Musk, he's for real.
[02:43:59.943 --> 02:44:00.643]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:44:00.643 --> 02:44:01.364]  I live here in Austin.
[02:44:01.364 --> 02:44:02.464]  He lives here.
[02:44:02.464 --> 02:44:07.066]  And I was told, I said on air two years ago, I said, Elon Musk wasn't awake before.
[02:44:07.066 --> 02:44:07.686]  He's pissed.
[02:44:07.686 --> 02:44:09.406]  He's getting ready to go after him.
[02:44:09.406 --> 02:44:12.387]  People said, oh, Jones BS.
[02:44:12.387 --> 02:44:14.608]  And you see what he's done now.
[02:44:14.608 --> 02:44:18.850]  Look, we are at the crossroads and Liberty is actually winning right now.
[02:44:18.850 --> 02:44:22.291]  So a lot of people who are on the fence are about to join us.
[02:44:22.291 --> 02:44:24.412]  We can't go after them once they join us.
[02:44:24.412 --> 02:44:26.533]  I hope Kennedy's for real.
[02:44:26.533 --> 02:44:27.333]  I got a bad feeling.
[02:44:28.311 --> 02:44:39.341]  I can't believe they killed his dad in front of him and he's more controlled by his wife than by his father being murdered in front of him.
[02:44:39.341 --> 02:44:44.867]  I've seen recent statements by him with Democrats where he tells them what they want to hear.
[02:44:44.867 --> 02:44:45.928]  I'm way past that, folks.
[02:44:46.568 --> 02:44:47.989]  Oh, well tell them what they want to hear to win.
[02:44:47.989 --> 02:44:48.209]  No.
[02:44:48.209 --> 02:44:51.391]  No, don't tell people what they want to hear.
[02:44:51.391 --> 02:44:53.332]  You can be guaranteed this here.
[02:44:53.332 --> 02:44:55.833]  You're not going to be told what you want to hear.
[02:44:55.833 --> 02:44:57.634]  You're going to be told what I think is right.
[02:44:57.634 --> 02:44:59.135]  And maybe I'm wrong sometimes.
[02:44:59.135 --> 02:45:01.296]  I don't claim to have all the answers.
[02:45:01.296 --> 02:45:02.917]  Ever.
[02:45:02.917 --> 02:45:03.778]  I just know this.
[02:45:03.778 --> 02:45:06.499]  I eat, drink, and sleep this.
[02:45:06.499 --> 02:45:08.660]  This is what I do.
[02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:11.402]  This is all I do.
[02:45:11.402 --> 02:45:12.642]  My buddies say, come play pool.
[02:45:12.642 --> 02:45:13.443]  He says, play pool.
[02:45:13.443 --> 02:45:14.103]  Sorry, can't do it.
[02:45:17.096 --> 02:45:17.957]  Go to a movie.
[02:45:17.957 --> 02:45:18.798]  Go to a rock concert.
[02:45:18.798 --> 02:45:19.318]  Sorry.
[02:45:19.318 --> 02:45:21.460]  Hey, we got a great boat out here on the lake.
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:22.761]  Chef's cooking food.
[02:45:22.761 --> 02:45:23.282]  Come out with us.
[02:45:23.282 --> 02:45:24.363]  And I tell them, no.
[02:45:24.363 --> 02:45:25.164]  And they go, why not?
[02:45:25.164 --> 02:45:27.186]  You deserve some fun.
[02:45:27.186 --> 02:45:32.611]  And I said, over and over again, my fun is hanging out with my family.
[02:45:32.611 --> 02:45:34.092]  That's all I do.
[02:45:34.092 --> 02:45:37.115]  I spend time with my family and I fight the new world order.
[02:45:37.115 --> 02:45:40.318]  And it's not that you're bad because you want to go to a ball game.
[02:45:41.618 --> 02:45:44.481]  Or you're bad because you want to go to a rock concert.
[02:45:44.481 --> 02:45:48.745]  It's that they just killed 20 million people with poison shots.
[02:45:48.745 --> 02:45:53.169]  And we're not supposed to keep acting like everything's okay while it's going on.
[02:45:53.169 --> 02:45:55.110]  I'll use the analogy yesterday on the show.
[02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:56.632]  If it was 4th of July in your neighborhood.
[02:45:58.064 --> 02:46:00.705]  And let's say you live in a country club neighborhood.
[02:46:00.705 --> 02:46:02.766]  Like I grew up in Dallas and I live in now.
[02:46:02.766 --> 02:46:07.468]  Got a golf course, got a hotel, got restaurants, great place, great nice people.
[02:46:07.468 --> 02:46:08.948]  Got a swimming pool in your backyard.
[02:46:08.948 --> 02:46:13.270]  And you're out there grilling steaks on 4th of July at like 8 o'clock at night.
[02:46:13.270 --> 02:46:15.411]  And everybody's drinking beer and everything's great.
[02:46:15.411 --> 02:46:21.273]  And the phone rings, hey have you heard there's 10 jihadis, this is a hypothetical, driving around shooting everybody in the neighborhood.
[02:46:22.717 --> 02:46:26.359]  Watch the TV, you go, well maybe they're about to drive by my house.
[02:46:26.359 --> 02:46:32.122]  So you grab your rifle, and I use this as an analogy, and you go outside, and maybe they drive down the road.
[02:46:32.122 --> 02:46:39.306]  And sure enough, a Toyota comes driving down the road with jihadis in the back of it shooting, and you kill them.
[02:46:39.306 --> 02:46:41.708]  Or at least you stay in your house.
[02:46:41.708 --> 02:46:45.930]  You don't, while the house is burning down, have a picnic in the backyard.
[02:46:45.930 --> 02:46:47.291]  And what I keep trying to explain to people,
[02:46:50.271 --> 02:46:53.756]  And you know, it gets to the point where I'm, you know, almost like celibate, too.
[02:46:53.756 --> 02:46:56.139]  Like, you know, my wife's like, hey, what's going on?
[02:46:56.139 --> 02:46:57.141]  You usually don't have a good time.
[02:46:57.141 --> 02:46:59.464]  I'm like, I got to go.
[02:46:59.464 --> 02:47:01.066]  Our daughter's gone to sleep.
[02:47:01.066 --> 02:47:02.208]  I got to go read more documents.
[02:47:03.353 --> 02:47:04.313]  She's like, do you love me anymore?
[02:47:04.313 --> 02:47:06.234]  And I'm like, I love you more than ever.
[02:47:06.234 --> 02:47:07.734]  I can't.
[02:47:07.734 --> 02:47:11.095]  The point is, is that nobody likes a good time like me.
[02:47:11.095 --> 02:47:12.515]  I love hunting.
[02:47:12.515 --> 02:47:13.355]  I love drinking.
[02:47:13.355 --> 02:47:16.356]  I love everything folks.
[02:47:16.356 --> 02:47:21.457]  I'll go to a rock concert with you and we'll be crawling around on the ground by the end of it.
[02:47:21.457 --> 02:47:29.939]  The point is we're not in that wheelhouse anymore.
[02:47:29.939 --> 02:47:31.399]  We're not there anymore.
[02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.725]  We are being overtaken.
[02:47:35.725 --> 02:47:37.805]  We are being murdered.
[02:47:37.805 --> 02:47:40.447]  And you've got to make this the main focus.
[02:47:40.447 --> 02:47:42.647]  This is it.
[02:47:42.647 --> 02:47:45.529]  I've said it a thousand times last year as I'll say it again.
[02:47:45.529 --> 02:47:50.270]  InfoWars is the reality.
[02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:54.732]  We told you the enemy plan because it was public and now they did it.
[02:47:54.732 --> 02:47:58.894]  And the next part of their phase is so hellish.
[02:47:58.894 --> 02:48:01.135]  I don't even have words to describe to you how bad it is.
[02:48:05.051 --> 02:48:11.232]  I mean, we're talking death camps, mass starvation, power grids turned off, people eating each other.
[02:48:11.232 --> 02:48:12.772]  I mean, that's really where we're going.
[02:48:12.772 --> 02:48:13.573]  And I mean that.
[02:48:13.573 --> 02:48:15.253]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[02:48:15.253 --> 02:48:16.693]  It's not a hypothetical.
[02:48:16.693 --> 02:48:29.615]  On our trajectory, I want my liberal neighbors to know that if they starve the third world to death, when it happens here, you will get eaten.
[02:48:29.615 --> 02:48:33.076]  And I don't want to go there, but in that world,
[02:48:34.685 --> 02:48:41.390]  If my daughter is starving to death, my others are grown up, but I've got a six year old.
[02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:44.993]  I mean, I will eat you.
[02:48:44.993 --> 02:48:51.337]  I'm not going to eat my conservative neighbors, but the people that ask for it, you're going to get eaten.
[02:48:51.337 --> 02:49:00.964]  And so that's a metaphysical statement, but it actually is a, is a final end scenario.
[02:49:00.964 --> 02:49:02.025]  Cause my daughter's not going hungry.
[02:49:03.959 --> 02:49:07.300]  And I'll haul you up by a chain.
[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:10.380]  And I'll chop you into steaks.
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:18.862]  And I know you think you're tough, because you run the courts and you're liberals and you got all these goons and stuff, but just listen.
[02:49:18.862 --> 02:49:20.462]  I'll eat you.
[02:49:20.462 --> 02:49:22.483]  And I don't want to do that.
[02:49:22.483 --> 02:49:25.863]  And I've asked you over and over again to stop.
[02:49:25.863 --> 02:49:29.484]  I'm trying to be as nice as I can, because I don't want to do that.
[02:49:30.836 --> 02:49:36.360]  But metaphysically, as an archetype, we're going to eat you.
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:42.065]  You put yourself in the cage with me.
[02:49:42.065 --> 02:49:43.366]  And there's no food.
[02:49:43.366 --> 02:49:44.606]  Just me and you in a cage.
[02:49:44.606 --> 02:49:47.309]  You're getting eaten.
[02:49:47.309 --> 02:49:50.291]  And I won't be guilty about it.
[02:49:50.291 --> 02:49:51.632]  So you want to devour our children?
[02:49:53.649 --> 02:49:55.070]  You think you run the tables?
[02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:56.291]  You think you're all powerful?
[02:49:56.291 --> 02:49:57.051]  You're not.
[02:49:57.051 --> 02:49:59.032]  And maybe you're gonna fight me.
[02:49:59.032 --> 02:50:00.413]  That's an even bigger joke.
[02:50:00.413 --> 02:50:04.255]  You're not gonna fight very long.
[02:50:04.255 --> 02:50:07.797]  I'm gonna overpower you.
[02:50:07.797 --> 02:50:10.939]  And I'm gonna strangle you.
[02:50:10.939 --> 02:50:13.341]  And then I'm gonna chop you up.
[02:50:13.341 --> 02:50:15.542]  And I'm gonna consume you.
[02:50:15.542 --> 02:50:16.843]  Because that's the world you put us in.
[02:50:18.018 --> 02:50:20.378]  That's the place you took us to.
[02:50:20.378 --> 02:50:22.439]  It's what you demanded.
[02:50:22.439 --> 02:50:24.499]  It's what you wanted.
[02:50:24.499 --> 02:50:29.180]  And God gives you everything you ask for.
[02:50:29.180 --> 02:50:34.421]  So, that said, let's not go there.
[02:50:34.421 --> 02:50:35.841]  Let's not be part of that.
[02:50:35.841 --> 02:50:45.783]  Let's not enter that world where you make sure the lesser angels are in charge.
[02:50:45.783 --> 02:50:47.203]  And let's change the world together.
[02:50:47.995 --> 02:50:49.136]  And let's circumvent that.
[02:50:49.136 --> 02:51:16.657]  But when I say those horrible things like the famous proposal, a modest proposal, which that just was, I want you to understand something that 80 plus million people, the UN estimates, starved to death under lockdowns the last four years, almost four years.
[02:51:19.594 --> 02:51:23.378]  Mommy couldn't get the food, Daddy couldn't get the food.
[02:51:23.378 --> 02:51:26.100]  And those children starved to death.
[02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:28.763]  I know it's laughter, you think it's cutesy and everything, but it's not.
[02:51:28.763 --> 02:51:30.405]  It's not funny.
[02:51:30.405 --> 02:51:32.467]  It's not funny.
[02:51:32.467 --> 02:51:38.773]  And so what I'm telling you is, I'm not going to take on your karma of all those children you murdered.
[02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:50.324]  In fact, maybe I'll save your children during all this, and I'll feed you to them, and they'll never know what's being cooked up in that big pot.
[02:51:50.324 --> 02:51:52.445]  Because you love Xi Jinping, right?
[02:51:52.445 --> 02:51:54.967]  You think he's real cute?
[02:51:54.967 --> 02:51:58.169]  You think he's your big archetype, big powerful guy up there?
[02:51:58.169 --> 02:51:59.950]  He proves communism works?
[02:51:59.950 --> 02:52:08.575]  Did you know that they killed over 100 million people under Mao Zedong through the current day, but about 80 million under Mao Zedong?
[02:52:08.575 --> 02:52:13.258]  And for at least a decade, the Communist Chinese Army
[02:52:17.315 --> 02:52:18.796]  There's photos of this.
[02:52:18.796 --> 02:52:21.678]  By the way, the Chinese government admits this happened.
[02:52:21.678 --> 02:52:27.101]  The government admits they did this in official communist Chinese books.
[02:52:27.101 --> 02:52:31.503]  They blame Mao Zedong's wife for it.
[02:52:31.503 --> 02:52:40.869]  That they ate over 100 million people in big giant pots.
[02:52:43.604 --> 02:52:58.070]  So when you were in the Communist Chinese military, and you got your rations every day, it was bowls of boiled human flesh.
[02:52:58.070 --> 02:53:06.714]  So, when I come to you with that allegory, you need to understand that Soylent Green is made out of people.
[02:53:08.226 --> 02:53:14.471]  And now you see the left saying, oh, we should have cannibalism and eat old people so we don't have more carbon.
[02:53:14.471 --> 02:53:18.274]  It's all dehumanization and you're debasing yourselves.
[02:53:18.274 --> 02:53:21.417]  You decide that newborn babies don't matter.
[02:53:21.417 --> 02:53:22.998]  You decide you don't matter.
[02:53:22.998 --> 02:53:24.820]  You decide old people don't matter.
[02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:29.584]  And by not having standards, none of us matter.
[02:53:29.584 --> 02:53:31.605]  And that's what I'm trying to get at here.
[02:53:31.605 --> 02:53:32.406]  It's not 3 a.m.
[02:53:32.406 --> 02:53:32.586]  yet.
[02:53:32.586 --> 02:53:33.347]  Let me button my shirt.
[02:53:35.811 --> 02:53:39.053]  So, that's where I met with all you people.
[02:53:39.053 --> 02:53:42.175]  This is real barbarism.
[02:53:42.175 --> 02:53:46.078]  And you don't have what it takes in that world.
[02:53:46.078 --> 02:53:47.499]  You don't even know what it's like.
[02:53:47.499 --> 02:53:48.920]  You look at the average leftist.
[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:57.746]  They are the weakest, softest, most pathetic people.
[02:53:57.746 --> 02:54:03.750]  Even if I'm old and not in the best shape, I could take on five big conservative men if I need to in my family.
[02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:04.870]  About five.
[02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:05.491]  I could take them out.
[02:54:06.854 --> 02:54:08.795]  With my bare hands.
[02:54:08.795 --> 02:54:11.837]  I can take out a hundred liberals.
[02:54:11.837 --> 02:54:14.058]  You people are a joke.
[02:54:14.058 --> 02:54:16.600]  But I don't want to take you out.
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:19.081]  But you're trying to take me out.
[02:54:19.081 --> 02:54:20.442]  By the decisions you've made.
[02:54:20.442 --> 02:54:21.883]  And I'll tell you again.
[02:54:21.883 --> 02:54:27.006]  I will eat your ass.
[02:54:27.006 --> 02:54:29.907]  And that's the metaphor here.
[02:54:29.907 --> 02:54:30.608]  The allegory.
[02:54:31.618 --> 02:54:34.619]  That you're entering a barbarous, insane world.
[02:54:34.619 --> 02:54:43.801]  You're worshipping Xi Jinping who literally sold his father and family out to the communist Chinese who were tortured and killed.
[02:54:43.801 --> 02:54:57.945]  And because he was so evil and sold out his own family, they chose him and Satan projected him up because if he'll betray his own father, he will betray humanity.
[02:54:59.929 --> 02:55:03.913]  That's your spirit animal, GGP.
[02:55:03.913 --> 02:55:06.695]  That's a piece of garbage.
[02:55:06.695 --> 02:55:16.544]  All right, I'm going to end this transmission here in the third hour today on this Tuesday live transmission.
[02:55:16.544 --> 02:55:17.926]  Please remember that
[02:55:19.139 --> 02:55:25.743]  It took us over a year plus to get this because we would not put out fake nascent iodine.
[02:55:25.743 --> 02:55:32.548]  I am so upset because it's so important for people that there are hundreds of companies claiming they have atomic nascent iodine.
[02:55:32.548 --> 02:55:34.209]  They do not.
[02:55:34.209 --> 02:55:37.391]  They don't get it from 12,000 to 15,000 feet over the earth.
[02:55:37.391 --> 02:55:43.795]  They don't go through all the patents and all the regulations to have pure, true iodine that goes right into your cells.
[02:55:43.795 --> 02:55:45.937]  We do, and the only bad news is
[02:55:47.347 --> 02:55:50.591]  After a year, we only got a limited supply.
[02:55:50.591 --> 02:55:52.573]  And so it's going to sell out very quickly.
[02:55:52.573 --> 02:56:02.864]  If you want X2, and free shipping, and double Patreon points, we've got Black Friday comes early at infowarestore.com.
[02:56:02.864 --> 02:56:08.591]  X2, powerful, incredible things for your whole body, electrochemical activity in every cell.
[02:56:10.438 --> 02:56:25.540]  Double Patreon points, free shipping store-wide, 60% off Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, 50% off Red Pill Plus, green fiber capsules, Xanadam sleep support, 40% off Vazo Complete.
[02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:26.601]  Finally back in stock.
[02:56:27.657 --> 02:56:30.959]  And I'm taking on the New World Order at point-blank range.
[02:56:30.959 --> 02:56:34.942]  And they say the end of the world's coming, the end of the world as we know it, if we don't fight this right now.
[02:56:55.091 --> 02:56:58.353]  So, everybody should get X2 while they still can.
[02:56:58.353 --> 02:57:00.835]  Hell, at current sales rates, it's a paradox.
[02:57:00.835 --> 02:57:02.376]  Oh great, funds are coming in.
[02:57:02.376 --> 02:57:03.457]  We have a limited supply.
[02:57:03.457 --> 02:57:05.878]  It'll be gone in weeks at current sales rates.
[02:57:05.878 --> 02:57:08.020]  Stock up on it now, because if they shut down Infowars...
[02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:14.804]  Which I think is a 30% chance the next six months you'll never get X2 at least here again.
[02:57:14.804 --> 02:57:15.765]  Get it now.
[02:57:15.765 --> 02:57:16.225]  X2.
[02:57:16.225 --> 02:57:21.188]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:21.188 --> 02:57:31.235]  And if you want to support me and the fact that I got to pay half the legal bills around here and that's what's destroying us, get the book The Great Awakening signed as a fundraiser or unsigned.
[02:57:31.235 --> 02:57:33.457]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:33.457 --> 02:57:37.580]  Alright, so that's it for this third hour.
[02:57:38.618 --> 02:57:41.240]  The next big guest host is coming up.
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:44.502]  I want you all to have an amazing Thanksgiving.
[02:57:44.502 --> 02:57:47.584]  Speaking of amazing, Vivint for Amaswani was amazing.
[02:57:47.584 --> 02:57:53.788]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[02:57:53.788 --> 02:57:58.471]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[02:57:58.471 --> 02:58:02.853]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:04.274 --> 02:58:07.336]  So many people have serious issues.
[02:58:07.336 --> 02:58:08.896]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[02:58:08.896 --> 02:58:14.839]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[02:58:14.839 --> 02:58:20.882]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[02:58:20.882 --> 02:58:23.644]  But this is pure atomic certified
[02:58:25.521 --> 02:58:26.863]  I don't know.
[02:58:47.465 --> 02:58:51.907]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[02:58:51.907 --> 02:58:55.809]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[02:58:55.809 --> 02:59:00.411]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's The New World Order Wars.
[02:59:00.411 --> 02:59:02.992]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[02:59:02.992 --> 02:59:05.293]  I'll eat your ass!
[02:59:05.293 --> 02:59:08.095]  You Nazi scum!
[02:59:08.095 --> 02:59:10.776]  Let's free the Patriots and defeat the globalist tech people.
[02:59:12.208 --> 02:59:16.738]  We are going to defeat the globalists very vaguely.
[02:59:16.738 --> 02:59:18.482]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[02:59:26.969 --> 02:59:30.691]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[02:59:30.691 --> 02:59:33.692]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist.
[02:59:33.692 --> 02:59:37.493]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[02:59:37.493 --> 02:59:49.017]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[02:59:49.017 --> 02:59:54.899]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.392 --> 03:00:04.753]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.753 --> 03:00:11.296]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com, and it is an honour to be here with you today.
[03:00:11.296 --> 03:00:16.619]  We'll have Mike Adams joining us in just a moment, but before he comes on, oh, here he is.
[03:00:16.619 --> 03:00:18.020]  I think he's with us now.
[03:00:18.020 --> 03:00:25.483]  I just wanted to say a few words about the calibre of the people that are speaking out right now.
[03:00:25.483 --> 03:00:26.864]  I think as we get
[03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:37.865]  Closer and closer to the complete chaos and destruction that's being orchestrated by the New World Order, times will get more difficult.
[03:00:37.865 --> 03:00:42.086]  And between now and then, it's really going to be a test of character.
[03:00:42.086 --> 03:00:51.507]  And I think that these past few weeks alone have really, really shown who can be trusted and who can't moving forward.
[03:00:51.507 --> 03:00:53.288]  Mike Adams is one of those people.
[03:00:53.288 --> 03:00:54.068]  He joins us now.
[03:00:54.068 --> 03:00:55.508]  Mike, thank you so much for your time.
[03:00:56.502 --> 03:00:57.342]  Well, thank you, Maria.
[03:00:57.342 --> 03:00:58.823]  It's an honor to join you today.
[03:00:58.823 --> 03:01:01.063]  Great to be on the channel.
[03:01:01.063 --> 03:01:02.243]  It's wonderful to see you.
[03:01:02.243 --> 03:01:05.704]  For anyone that's not following Mike, please follow Natural News.
[03:01:05.704 --> 03:01:08.265]  Follow him on X. Watch Brighteon.com.
[03:01:08.265 --> 03:01:10.245]  He does a daily broadcast.
[03:01:10.245 --> 03:01:12.106]  The Health Ranger Report.
[03:01:12.106 --> 03:01:13.826]  Always spot on analysis.
[03:01:13.826 --> 03:01:15.107]  Always spot on analysis.
[03:01:15.107 --> 03:01:18.647]  Mike, I think, I guess I want to ask you about this
[03:01:21.828 --> 03:01:27.452]  The latest wave, obviously you and I spoke very early on with the Middle Eastern conflict.
[03:01:27.452 --> 03:01:35.058]  We did an interview and we were kind of both perplexed by the emotional and irrational response from people.
[03:01:35.058 --> 03:01:37.839]  Now a few weeks on, do you think that's settled?
[03:01:37.839 --> 03:01:41.242]  Do you think that now people are starting to be able to sift through the facts?
[03:01:42.819 --> 03:01:54.910]  Well, I think you just mentioned something really critical to understand here, that globalists are orchestrating events right now in order to destroy humanity and to cause chaos that will give them power.
[03:01:54.910 --> 03:01:57.532]  And what happened on October 7th is no different.
[03:01:57.532 --> 03:02:01.756]  In fact, I equate October 7th with January 6th.
[03:02:03.085 --> 03:02:14.832]  Both events were in many ways orchestrated by governments in order to justify the actions that they wanted to take against certain people that they are targeting.
[03:02:14.832 --> 03:02:18.254]  Of course, January 6th now, the truth is coming out.
[03:02:18.254 --> 03:02:21.395]  It was a staged insurrection.
[03:02:21.395 --> 03:02:25.938]  It was orchestrated by the powers that be so they could cover up a stolen election.
[03:02:27.014 --> 03:02:29.177]  And it was successful in that way.
[03:02:29.177 --> 03:02:36.405]  They shut down the alternate electors wave that was building momentum and people questioning that election.
[03:02:36.405 --> 03:02:46.597]  But October 7th in Israel, and of course Hamas was originally funded in part by Israel, and it's a creation of Mossad and other intelligence agencies.
[03:02:47.784 --> 03:03:00.414]  Hamas was allowed to attack on October 7th, carry out its bloodshed, its acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians and military targets, so that Israel could have its justification for what it's doing now.
[03:03:00.414 --> 03:03:02.976]  So, Maria, I mean, that's the big picture here.
[03:03:02.976 --> 03:03:04.697]  We are all being played.
[03:03:04.697 --> 03:03:05.898]  Real people are dying.
[03:03:05.898 --> 03:03:07.579]  There's too much suffering.
[03:03:07.579 --> 03:03:08.840]  We don't need this.
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:12.583]  I'm calling for peace, but on a global level.
[03:03:12.583 --> 03:03:14.865]  Peace is the only way to defeat the globalists.
[03:03:16.744 --> 03:03:17.966]  I absolutely agree with you.
[03:03:17.966 --> 03:03:23.572]  I just want to let people know about an observation from my end.
[03:03:23.572 --> 03:03:35.186]  I watched a pastor that I really do respect and he had a guest on recently and that guest was talking about collecting donations for weapons for the IDF.
[03:03:37.326 --> 03:03:38.808]  I simply cannot understand.
[03:03:38.808 --> 03:03:50.545]  First of all, US tax dollars, tax dollars of many, many people around the world are already going to the IDF to be collecting donations from churchgoers for more weapons.
[03:03:52.508 --> 03:03:54.269]  To kill innocent civilians.
[03:03:54.269 --> 03:03:57.512]  We're not just fighting Hamas here.
[03:03:57.512 --> 03:04:02.216]  We're talking about killing innocent civilians, bombing churches, bombing hospitals.
[03:04:02.216 --> 03:04:09.702]  Another school was just bombed as well, where refugees and innocents are being sheltered.
[03:04:09.702 --> 03:04:17.168]  Sorry, but the key here, and I know we'll talk about this on the other side of the break here, but
[03:04:18.562 --> 03:04:25.124]  What's happening, what you just described, is making our world more dangerous for Americans and more dangerous for Israelis.
[03:04:25.124 --> 03:04:31.725]  So if Israel is to survive, they have to change course, and we need to talk about that in more detail.
[03:04:31.725 --> 03:04:43.708]  Because if we are pro-Israel, and if we support Jewish people and Judaism, we must call for a halting of what is happening right now, because that is a path of destruction of the State of Israel, I believe.
[03:04:44.978 --> 03:04:46.320]  I absolutely agree with you.
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:53.549]  I want to read a portion of a letter that was sent to me by a friend from Israel, which absolutely backs up what you're saying.
[03:04:53.549 --> 03:04:55.191]  We'll be back on the other side of this break.
[03:04:55.191 --> 03:04:55.832]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:04:59.088 --> 03:05:06.775]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[03:05:06.775 --> 03:05:15.324]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down-N-Out, is just the thing.
[03:05:15.324 --> 03:05:21.710]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[03:05:22.344 --> 03:05:27.070]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out.
[03:05:27.070 --> 03:05:32.777]  Now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[03:05:32.777 --> 03:05:37.643]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[03:05:37.643 --> 03:05:41.308]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[03:05:41.428 --> 03:05:41.809]  I think so.
[03:06:03.712 --> 03:06:07.755]  Well I'm so so grateful for InfoWars and for Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.755 --> 03:06:09.817]  This platform is so vital.
[03:06:09.817 --> 03:06:19.806]  Having the most important conversations really on earth about things that actually matter and things that can change the course of history.
[03:06:19.806 --> 03:06:21.567]  So please support InfoWars.
[03:06:21.567 --> 03:06:27.432]  Head to the InfoWars store today and get yourself a high quality supplement.
[03:06:27.432 --> 03:06:30.695]  Get yourself a signed copy of Alex's book and support
[03:06:31.235 --> 03:06:31.815]  We're good to go.
[03:06:56.085 --> 03:07:03.512]  Any of them to be in any further danger, not collecting donations and arming the IDF for further escalation.
[03:07:03.512 --> 03:07:05.674]  You are angering the entire world.
[03:07:05.674 --> 03:07:07.836]  Your comments, Mike?
[03:07:07.836 --> 03:07:13.021]  Well, there's a key factor here that I think everybody is forgetting or just neglecting to recognize.
[03:07:13.021 --> 03:07:19.968]  And you, Maria, you've interviewed many guests about the coming de-dollarization that's happening in our world.
[03:07:20.837 --> 03:07:33.411]  And, you know, the BRICS nations next year are about to roll out their BRICS settlement currencies between nations, and you will see global use of the dollar absolutely plummet.
[03:07:33.411 --> 03:07:41.160]  And Saudi Arabia is one of the nations that's joining the BRICS Plus group, as you know, in January, I believe, and there are many other nations as well.
[03:07:41.761 --> 03:07:48.944]  We are rapidly approaching the point where a hundred major nations around the world will stop trading with the dollar.
[03:07:48.944 --> 03:07:57.528]  China is already selling off dollar debt, treasuries, and other nations are doing that as well, as their central banks are buying physical gold.
[03:07:57.528 --> 03:07:59.708]  Now, what does this have to do with Israel?
[03:07:59.708 --> 03:08:00.849]  It has everything to do with Israel.
[03:08:01.593 --> 03:08:06.939]  Because Israel is only propped up by United States funding and the U.S.
[03:08:06.939 --> 03:08:07.920]  military.
[03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:08.501]  If the U.S.
[03:08:08.501 --> 03:08:23.377]  Navy were not there in, well, the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, and also I think near the Red Sea right now with the Eisenhower Group, Israel would probably already be overrun by Hezbollah, by Turkey,
[03:08:24.051 --> 03:08:28.353]  By Syria, by the Arab nations that surround Israel.
[03:08:28.353 --> 03:08:51.364]  There is an ocean of angry Arabs surrounding Israel, a relatively tiny nation that appears to be, in my opinion, carrying out a level of atrocities against Palestinian civilians that are designed to provoke a wider war because the United States is asking Israel to escalate this to the point where the U.S.
[03:08:51.364 --> 03:08:52.625]  can justify bombing Iran.
[03:08:54.963 --> 03:08:56.824]  That seems to be the real narrative behind this.
[03:08:56.824 --> 03:09:12.867]  But the dollar, when the dollar loses its value and really collapses, and this can happen in an accelerating way due to the mad money printing and the abandonment of the dollar globally, when the dollar goes down, how will the U.S.
[03:09:12.867 --> 03:09:14.147]  support Israel?
[03:09:14.147 --> 03:09:16.968]  When the dollar dies, Israel has no more U.S.
[03:09:16.968 --> 03:09:21.409]  support, and Israel then is so vulnerable and will probably
[03:09:22.156 --> 03:09:26.738]  Potentially be attacked and maybe even overrun by those Arab nations.
[03:09:26.738 --> 03:09:29.840]  So Israel's fate is tied to the fate of the dollar.
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:31.240]  Everybody's forgetting that.
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:34.622]  And the fate of the dollar is that the dollar is going to zero, folks.
[03:09:34.622 --> 03:09:35.282]  It's going to zero.
[03:09:35.282 --> 03:09:37.664]  We don't know when, but that's about to happen.
[03:09:37.664 --> 03:09:45.907]  So maybe, just my opinion, maybe Israel should figure out how to get along with its neighbors instead of provoking them into bloodlust and war.
[03:09:45.907 --> 03:09:46.868]  That's just my take.
[03:09:48.331 --> 03:09:49.792]  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you, Mike.
[03:09:49.792 --> 03:09:55.334]  I want to read a few excerpts from this letter that was sent to me by a Jewish friend in Israel.
[03:09:55.334 --> 03:10:04.218]  I have to keep them anonymous, Mike, because now, in Israel, if you speak out and the government doesn't like it, they take you to prison for two years and they seize your house.
[03:10:04.218 --> 03:10:08.700]  Police also have the go-ahead to kill protesters.
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:12.282]  So it's absolutely dangerous for the people there right now.
[03:10:13.070 --> 03:10:14.391]  If they disagree with the government.
[03:10:14.391 --> 03:10:18.514]  But this person said this was never about an Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
[03:10:18.514 --> 03:10:21.356]  It was always a globalist agenda to control the entire planet.
[03:10:22.051 --> 03:10:31.518]  Regional conflicts have been built in by the globalists into several regions of the world so that they could invoke them whenever their globalist agendas required them.
[03:10:31.518 --> 03:10:44.408]  This person goes on to talk about how this is a regional conflict that's been built into Israel since 1948 and they acknowledge that the land of Israel must have some profound spiritual significance for the globalists.
[03:10:44.408 --> 03:10:45.469]  It does, absolutely.
[03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:47.551]  For Satanists, it has a huge spiritual
[03:10:48.411 --> 03:10:50.774]  I'm not saying that Jewish people are Satanists.
[03:10:50.774 --> 03:10:58.362]  I'm saying that the Satanists in controlling the world have a tie to that land.
[03:10:58.362 --> 03:11:01.746]  He says, the New World Order is coming to all parts of the world.
[03:11:01.746 --> 03:11:06.071]  Sadly, it is tragic that the epicenter of this tsunami should be in Israel.
[03:11:07.378 --> 03:11:12.600]  And goes on to talk about Netanyahu creating the lab for Pfizer.
[03:11:12.600 --> 03:11:16.582]  And then, when the dust settles, I don't know what will remain here.
[03:11:16.582 --> 03:11:30.047]  Well, whoever remains, no doubt, will face ruins of society, economy, buildings, infrastructure, and shall face the harbinger of a global great reset with permanent lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, and a social credit system and CBDCs.
[03:11:30.047 --> 03:11:30.687]  I think people
[03:11:31.187 --> 03:11:42.733]  Mike may have forgotten that every single government thus far has been working in collusion to inject people, to poison them, to bring in CBDCs, to bring in social credit scores.
[03:11:42.733 --> 03:11:53.199]  This is every government working together on this and these types of crises escalate their ability to do that and I'll comment more on that but I'll get your uptake.
[03:11:54.835 --> 03:11:55.955]  No, that's exactly right.
[03:11:55.955 --> 03:11:58.176]  This feeds right into the globalist agenda.
[03:11:58.176 --> 03:12:03.177]  And remember that the globalists celebrate the deaths of human beings no matter who is dying.
[03:12:03.177 --> 03:12:09.039]  So, you know, if tribe A is fighting tribe B, the globalists don't care as long as there's blood in the streets.
[03:12:09.039 --> 03:12:14.841]  And really, and I think David Icke has said this before, that all wars are a satanic blood ritual.
[03:12:14.841 --> 03:12:16.902]  It's a human sacrifice ritual.
[03:12:16.902 --> 03:12:18.582]  And we saw that in Ukraine.
[03:12:18.582 --> 03:12:21.503]  I think, you know, according to reliable estimates,
[03:12:22.202 --> 03:12:28.867]  At least 400,000 Ukrainians, maybe half a million, have been killed in this conflict with Russia.
[03:12:28.867 --> 03:12:31.408]  That's a blood sacrifice to Satan.
[03:12:31.408 --> 03:12:33.190]  It did not have to happen.
[03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:35.871]  And that did happen because of the U.S.
[03:12:35.871 --> 03:12:40.454]  Empire pushing the expansion of NATO and provoking Russia.
[03:12:40.454 --> 03:12:41.615]  But this is what the U.S.
[03:12:41.615 --> 03:12:48.300]  does as the world's bully, running around the world with coercion, with weapons, with weaponization of the currency, the dollar.
[03:12:48.860 --> 03:12:58.489]  Cutting people off from the SWIFT system, which they did to Russia, and then bombing civilian infrastructure such as the Nord Stream Pipelines, which is destroying Germany's economy.
[03:12:58.489 --> 03:13:04.555]  By the way, which makes it insane that Germany is giving more weapons to Ukraine, you know, to continue to carry this out.
[03:13:05.788 --> 03:13:06.429]  The U.S.
[03:13:06.429 --> 03:13:10.031]  weaponizes everything against we, the people, right now.
[03:13:10.031 --> 03:13:11.533]  And it doesn't have to be this way.
[03:13:11.533 --> 03:13:17.938]  You know, I love America, the founding principles, what America is supposed to stand for, and I want to see that come back.
[03:13:17.938 --> 03:13:25.624]  But the globalists that are currently in charge of the United States of America, they do not represent the American spirit or the American people.
[03:13:25.624 --> 03:13:28.526]  And they are running around the world trying to destroy everything.
[03:13:28.526 --> 03:13:34.651]  Basically pillaging, bombing, pillaging, assassinating, carrying out regime change to other countries around the world.
[03:13:35.251 --> 03:13:39.415]  And the more conflict there is, the more power they have over all of us.
[03:13:39.415 --> 03:13:46.340]  We should expect there to be another pandemic, another war, and domestic terrorism.
[03:13:46.340 --> 03:14:00.531]  Maria, I just did an interview, literally 10 minutes before I got on with you, of a man who is working with the military in Texas, and I couldn't show his face, so it's an audio-only recording.
[03:14:00.531 --> 03:14:02.533]  He just told me, he works with intel groups,
[03:14:03.214 --> 03:14:08.517]  He's on calls with the FBI, with the CIA, with DHS, with Homeland Security.
[03:14:08.517 --> 03:14:12.078]  They are expecting over two dozen U.S.
[03:14:12.078 --> 03:14:24.024]  cities to be hit by domestic terrorism carried out by outraged Middle Eastern terrorists who have reached the tipping point because of what's happening with Israel.
[03:14:24.651 --> 03:14:25.692]  So the U.S.
[03:14:25.692 --> 03:14:29.874]  is going to be hit with bombs, infrastructure bombs.
[03:14:29.874 --> 03:14:35.218]  We're talking refineries, railroads, bridges, maybe government buildings, ports.
[03:14:36.241 --> 03:14:39.062]  Because of what Israel is doing in Gaza.
[03:14:39.062 --> 03:14:41.963]  Right now, we are less safe in America.
[03:14:41.963 --> 03:14:43.463]  Not just Israel.
[03:14:43.463 --> 03:14:45.164]  Not just the people living in Tel Aviv.
[03:14:45.164 --> 03:14:47.364]  We, the Americans, are less safe.
[03:14:47.364 --> 03:14:48.845]  And the fact that we have U.S.
[03:14:48.845 --> 03:14:55.687]  Navy there, and we are giving Israel money to keep bombing Gaza, this is a suicide mission of the West.
[03:14:56.463 --> 03:14:59.007]  We are going to be the ones that are hurt by this.
[03:14:59.007 --> 03:15:02.232]  Wait until the bombs start falling on we, the people, in America.
[03:15:02.232 --> 03:15:03.995]  Then, will you call for a ceasefire?
[03:15:03.995 --> 03:15:07.119]  Those of you watching who want to keep the bombs going?
[03:15:07.119 --> 03:15:07.620]  You will.
[03:15:07.620 --> 03:15:10.224]  You'll beg for a ceasefire when that day comes.
[03:15:10.224 --> 03:15:10.585]  Trust me.
[03:15:11.209 --> 03:15:12.050]  Those are my thoughts, Maria.
[03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:13.150]  Absolutely agree with you.
[03:15:13.150 --> 03:15:14.151]  I agree with you, Mike.
[03:15:14.151 --> 03:15:26.559]  Tim, if you can pull up the clip just as B-roll of the Canadian Parliament and how it's fine, an insurrection is absolutely fine if it's a pro-Palestine rally.
[03:15:26.559 --> 03:15:37.906]  We already know that Soros is funding, well, according to the latest figures, $14 million into pro-Palestine rallies.
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:44.645]  And so further invoking the anger of the Arab world, of the Muslim world.
[03:15:44.645 --> 03:15:46.647]  And then this is allowed.
[03:15:46.647 --> 03:15:47.348]  This is allowed.
[03:15:47.348 --> 03:15:52.413]  We're allowed to keep raising the anger and the tension.
[03:15:52.413 --> 03:15:54.435]  But January 6th landed you in prison.
[03:15:54.435 --> 03:15:55.135]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:55.135 --> 03:15:55.716]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:58.644 --> 03:16:02.748]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[03:16:02.748 --> 03:16:04.669]  You don't want my thanks.
[03:16:04.669 --> 03:16:08.432]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters.
[03:16:08.432 --> 03:16:10.634]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[03:16:10.634 --> 03:16:11.815]  And you know what?
[03:16:11.815 --> 03:16:15.098]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[03:16:15.098 --> 03:16:19.381]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time.
[03:16:21.701 --> 03:16:24.424]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists.
[03:16:24.424 --> 03:16:28.187]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[03:16:28.187 --> 03:16:29.809]  And I know you are as well.
[03:16:29.809 --> 03:16:32.231]  So thank you for standing with us, because you are the Infowar.
[03:16:32.231 --> 03:16:35.834]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us however you can.
[03:16:35.834 --> 03:16:42.481]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar.
[03:16:42.481 --> 03:16:44.543]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[03:16:45.603 --> 03:16:47.207]  You have made history.
[03:16:47.207 --> 03:16:49.091]  We have made history together.
[03:16:49.091 --> 03:16:51.195]  Infowars.com.

[03:17:00.603 --> 03:17:05.167]  But because of supply chain breakdowns and other issues, this is our biggest sale.
[03:17:05.167 --> 03:17:09.449]  Because finally, almost all of our best-selling products are finally back in stock.

[03:19:57.887 --> 03:20:02.510]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:09.055]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:09.055 --> 03:20:15.660]  Welcome back.
[03:20:15.660 --> 03:20:17.821]  We're here with Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[03:20:17.821 --> 03:20:25.127]  Just before the break, we played a clip of the Canadian Parliament of the insurrection in the Canadian Parliament.
[03:20:25.127 --> 03:20:26.968]  And and of course, that's allowed.
[03:20:27.728 --> 03:20:29.389]  But Owen Troyer's in prison.
[03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:30.910]  Mike, absolutely unbelievable.
[03:20:30.910 --> 03:20:41.437]  But the point of me playing that was they really are, and you made a very valid point, I say Soros-funded pro-Palestine protests, yes, they are stoking the fire right now.
[03:20:41.437 --> 03:20:50.223]  They are pushing the Islamic world, which does have an underlying ideology that's ready for jihad.
[03:20:50.883 --> 03:20:52.444]  Yeah, that's exactly where this is going.
[03:20:52.444 --> 03:20:55.847]  And to our audience here, all the Infowarriors, you know, understand that if you pick a tribe,
[03:21:10.285 --> 03:21:11.146]  You've already lost.
[03:21:11.146 --> 03:21:12.827]  You're being manipulated by the system.
[03:21:12.827 --> 03:21:17.511]  They want you to pick a tribe and call for the total destruction of the other tribe.
[03:21:17.511 --> 03:21:18.231]  That's it.
[03:21:18.231 --> 03:21:23.855]  The way to win the game is to not play within the confines of what the globalists have set for us.
[03:21:24.867 --> 03:21:26.149]  Do not play that game.
[03:21:26.149 --> 03:21:36.020]  Instead, transcend that and say, wait a second, wait a second, how do we actually de-escalate and not have violence and not have another crisis and not have another emergency?
[03:21:36.020 --> 03:21:38.443]  Remember what they did during the COVID emergency.
[03:21:38.443 --> 03:21:42.528]  They took so much power away from the American people and they pushed mandates.
[03:21:42.528 --> 03:21:43.088]  And by the way,
[03:21:43.809 --> 03:21:45.430]  They push mandates on our soldiers.
[03:21:45.430 --> 03:21:46.371]  And right now the U.S.
[03:21:46.371 --> 03:21:55.116]  Army is begging for un-vaxxed soldiers, right, to come back and ostensibly to die for Israel in an expanded war in the Middle East.
[03:21:55.116 --> 03:22:00.699]  So, you know, where's the apology, by the way, to our veterans and our soldiers who said no to the vaccine?
[03:22:00.699 --> 03:22:05.242]  Over 8,000 were kicked out of the Army alone for saying no to the vaccines.
[03:22:05.242 --> 03:22:06.843]  There should be an apology?
[03:22:06.843 --> 03:22:08.464]  They should get back pay?
[03:22:08.464 --> 03:22:10.065]  They should have their rank reinstated?
[03:22:11.521 --> 03:22:15.704]  If not, you know, some kind of financial award of some kind.
[03:22:15.704 --> 03:22:17.145]  They had the right answer.
[03:22:17.145 --> 03:22:27.953]  There should be an apology to our military personnel and by the way, and I know I've taken some heat for this, but I believe that Trump should come out and apologize for pushing Operation Warp Speed.
[03:22:28.573 --> 03:22:33.236]  On the US troops as well and pushing a vaccine without proper testing.
[03:22:33.236 --> 03:22:35.217]  We now know the aftermath of that.
[03:22:35.217 --> 03:22:39.839]  How many millions of Americans have been disabled and taken out of the workforce?
[03:22:39.839 --> 03:22:45.582]  They've suffered vaccine injuries and many Americans are dead now because of these vaccines and in Israel.
[03:22:46.002 --> 03:22:46.162]  Yes.
[03:23:16.784 --> 03:23:26.225]  Peacefully removed from office because he is driving Israel through a suicide mission that will harm more Israeli people and will ultimately harm America as well.
[03:23:27.549 --> 03:23:29.110]  Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike.
[03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:48.464]  In fact, I recall speaking with people in Israel at the time of, I think it was the third or fourth injection, and the hospitals were overrun, the funeral homes were overrun with injected victims and people that have died as a direct result of the injections.
[03:23:48.464 --> 03:23:49.965]  This has been a catastrophic
[03:23:50.425 --> 03:23:52.888]  He's a war criminal against his own civilians!
[03:24:13.417 --> 03:24:14.978]  I mean, not to mention Gaza.
[03:24:14.978 --> 03:24:17.018]  I mean, take Gaza out of it.
[03:24:17.018 --> 03:24:22.620]  Netanyahu is a war criminal against the Israeli people.
[03:24:22.620 --> 03:24:25.421]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:24:25.421 --> 03:24:28.782]  And I know this letter that you're talking about, the U.S.
[03:24:28.782 --> 03:24:35.804]  Army sent a letter to former service members dismissed for refusing the injection and they can now request corrections of their discharge records
[03:24:36.651 --> 03:24:39.173]  Uh, because they're struggling with recruitment.
[03:24:39.173 --> 03:24:49.462]  Fancy getting rid of your most respected service members in the country because they don't want to play Russian roulette with a COVID death shot.
[03:24:49.462 --> 03:24:56.748]  And then because you don't have enough people to go and die for a foreign nation, inviting them to come back and die.
[03:24:56.748 --> 03:24:57.209]  Some more!
[03:24:58.146 --> 03:25:05.635]  I mean this is, surely no one, surely no one Mike wants to go and fight in these bogus foreign wars anymore.
[03:25:05.635 --> 03:25:10.861]  This has nothing to do with protecting your own soil and everything to do with advancing a globalist agenda.
[03:25:12.028 --> 03:25:18.912]  Well, and also, you know, enriching the corrupt corporations that control our elections and control our media, right?
[03:25:18.912 --> 03:25:26.537]  So, in fact, this hundred plus billion dollars that was supposedly sent to Ukraine, only a small fraction of that actually went to Ukraine.
[03:25:26.537 --> 03:25:28.438]  Most of that went to the U.S.
[03:25:28.438 --> 03:25:32.381]  weapons manufacturers, companies like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin and Boeing and so on.
[03:25:33.121 --> 03:25:41.310]  And those weapons will never be manufactured in time to do anything in Ukraine because that war is already lost.
[03:25:41.310 --> 03:25:51.180]  And by the way, even the mainstream media in America is finally coming around and using terms and saying, well, it was magical thinking to think that the U.S.
[03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:52.942]  and Ukraine could beat Russia.
[03:25:52.942 --> 03:25:53.643]  Yeah, it was.
[03:25:53.643 --> 03:25:54.364]  It was delusional.
[03:25:55.557 --> 03:25:58.180]  Russia has won that conflict.
[03:25:58.180 --> 03:25:59.481]  Ukraine has lost.
[03:25:59.481 --> 03:26:06.108]  And now it's only a matter of time before there's going to be terms of a peace agreement or terms of surrender, you could call it.
[03:26:06.108 --> 03:26:08.270]  Russia's probably going to get Odessa.
[03:26:08.270 --> 03:26:18.820]  And all that money that supposedly went to Ukraine is just going to end up in the hands of the weapons manufacturers with more of those weapons eventually coming off the assembly lines over the next two to three years.
[03:26:19.978 --> 03:26:21.519]  And not helping Ukraine.
[03:26:21.519 --> 03:26:24.580]  So none of that money went to the Ukrainian soldiers, by the way.
[03:26:24.580 --> 03:26:30.402]  And my heart goes out to the Ukrainian soldiers, because they acted with courage themselves.
[03:26:30.402 --> 03:26:36.565]  I mean, they went up against Russia, for God's sake, on the battlefield, and hundreds of thousands of them died.
[03:26:36.565 --> 03:26:41.467]  And that takes bravery and courage and dedication, and my heart goes out to them.
[03:26:42.367 --> 03:26:44.750]  Those young men should not have died.
[03:26:44.750 --> 03:26:50.436]  They should be coders and engineers and attorneys and doctors and whatever.
[03:26:50.436 --> 03:26:53.720]  They should be members of society of a thriving Ukrainian country.
[03:26:53.720 --> 03:27:01.969]  But it was destroyed by the United States of America because we wanted to use Ukraine as a proxy puppet nation to weaken Russia.
[03:27:02.429 --> 03:27:03.550]  And it backfired.
[03:27:03.550 --> 03:27:05.991]  It backfired on Ukraine, it backfired on the United States.
[03:27:05.991 --> 03:27:14.396]  Russia is stronger than ever with its domestic economy, its industrial output, its weapons manufacturing now seven times higher than all of NATO combined.
[03:27:14.396 --> 03:27:15.296]  And the U.S.
[03:27:15.296 --> 03:27:25.922]  can't even recruit people because the Pentagon has gone woke trying to push, you know, rainbows and push-up bras and high heels for soldiers instead of saying, hey, let's defend America.
[03:27:25.922 --> 03:27:28.464]  I mean, the world has gone freaking insane, Maria.
[03:27:30.430 --> 03:27:34.750]  I'm going to control myself here, but this situation is out of control.
[03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:35.092]  It's bad.
[03:27:36.667 --> 03:27:37.687]  I agree with you, Mike.
[03:27:37.687 --> 03:27:40.288]  Every single day it's becoming more and more insane.
[03:27:40.288 --> 03:27:48.391]  By the way, Germany's just given another $1.3 billion to Ukraine in the greatest money laundering operation seen since the dawn of man.
[03:27:48.391 --> 03:27:48.951]  Seriously.
[03:27:48.951 --> 03:27:54.152]  You know, the whole world is acknowledging that this is over.
[03:27:54.152 --> 03:27:57.993]  You know, Zelensky's out there asking for loans.
[03:27:57.993 --> 03:28:01.254]  I mean, we'll pay you back, I promise.
[03:28:01.254 --> 03:28:02.695]  It's just embarrassing.
[03:28:03.295 --> 03:28:06.576]  It's embarrassing, but he's been embarrassing from the start.
[03:28:06.576 --> 03:28:12.977]  And so Germany's just pledged another 1.3 billion taxpayer dollars to what?
[03:28:12.977 --> 03:28:27.239]  To Ukraine 24, the new HQ of the fully, fully AI-run government, where the New World Order is at the top and all of the middle levels of government are removed, and you just have AI running everything.
[03:28:27.239 --> 03:28:32.120]  And this is where, after the break, I want to segue into Javier Millet,
[03:28:33.201 --> 03:28:46.854]  Mike, because I know you have some thoughts, and so do I, and I think that I can offer, and maybe you can too, a different perspective on why he's ripping down all of these areas of government.
[03:28:46.854 --> 03:28:49.556]  The team can get that clip ready for after the break.
[03:28:49.556 --> 03:28:55.041]  What he's actually doing, and who the hell waves a foreign nations flag as part of their victory.
[03:28:55.041 --> 03:28:55.642]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:56.564 --> 03:29:02.008]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[03:29:02.008 --> 03:29:11.836]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[03:29:13.277 --> 03:29:14.859]  I think so.
[03:29:36.375 --> 03:29:37.036]  We're good to go.
[03:29:56.923 --> 03:30:03.150]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:30:03.150 --> 03:30:07.816]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners, and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:30:07.816 --> 03:30:12.221]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[03:30:13.622 --> 03:30:16.684]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:30:16.684 --> 03:30:18.245]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:30:18.245 --> 03:30:24.209]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:30:24.209 --> 03:30:30.233]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[03:30:30.233 --> 03:30:32.995]  But this is pure atomic certified
[03:30:34.893 --> 03:30:36.094]  I don't know.
[03:30:56.494 --> 03:31:04.759]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on.
[03:31:04.759 --> 03:31:06.220]  And these are game-changing products.
[03:31:06.220 --> 03:31:08.061]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[03:31:08.061 --> 03:31:10.282]  These products are incredible.
[03:31:10.282 --> 03:31:14.065]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[03:31:14.065 --> 03:31:24.651]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[03:31:25.776 --> 03:31:28.697]  We've got 3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[03:31:28.697 --> 03:31:33.740]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[03:31:33.740 --> 03:31:38.302]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[03:31:38.302 --> 03:31:45.165]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of PainMD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[03:31:45.165 --> 03:31:51.348]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:31:57.162 --> 03:32:16.852]  Normally Christmas is our biggest sale of the year, but because of supply chain breakdowns and other issues, this is our biggest sale because finally almost all of our best-selling products are finally back in stock, including, sold out for more than a year, X2, the only true nascent iodine out there, is finally back.
[03:32:16.852 --> 03:32:21.434]  What it does for your immune system, your body, all your cells, is miraculous.
[03:32:21.434 --> 03:32:23.355]  It's discounted at FortWorthShore.com.
[03:32:23.355 --> 03:32:25.416]  Double Patriot points, free shipping,
[03:32:25.936 --> 03:32:28.858]  Biggest sale, hands down, of 2023.
[03:32:28.858 --> 03:32:31.620]  I'm sure Christmas will have a big sale, but we'll be sold out of most of this.
[03:32:31.620 --> 03:32:33.502]  So, Christmas has come early.
[03:32:33.502 --> 03:32:35.043]  Black Friday's come early.
[03:32:35.043 --> 03:32:36.404]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[03:32:36.404 --> 03:32:37.605]  Get X2.
[03:32:37.605 --> 03:32:39.486]  Get Vazzo Beats back in stock.
[03:32:39.486 --> 03:32:44.710]  Get all the other great products at InfoWarStore.com right now.
[03:32:44.710 --> 03:32:45.050]  But again,
[03:32:46.011 --> 03:32:48.793]  Our fan favorite, my favorite, is X2.
[03:32:48.793 --> 03:32:50.274]  Sold out for over a year.
[03:32:50.274 --> 03:32:52.115]  Could be our last run if we're shut down.
[03:32:52.115 --> 03:32:53.196]  Get it while you can.
[03:32:53.196 --> 03:32:53.937]  X2.
[03:32:53.937 --> 03:32:58.840]  Discount at info or store.com.
[03:32:58.840 --> 03:33:03.464]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:03.464 --> 03:33:08.968]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:08.968 --> 03:33:11.870]  The program leftists failed to silence.
[03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:13.451]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.346 --> 03:33:27.470]  Welcome back, we're here with Mike Adams from Brighteon, really should be one of the top people that everyone is listening to.
[03:33:27.470 --> 03:33:37.535]  I think that as times get more difficult, as I said at the start of this show, people's true characters really will come out and Mike has been consistent for many, many years.
[03:33:37.535 --> 03:33:41.156]  Micah, I want to talk about Javier Millet.
[03:33:41.156 --> 03:33:43.858]  Most conservatives are absolutely celebrating this guy.
[03:33:45.258 --> 03:33:50.560]  Less than one second, Google search will show you his history with the World Economic Forum.
[03:33:50.560 --> 03:33:54.281]  Very long history of all of these organizations he's been involved in.
[03:33:54.281 --> 03:33:59.722]  But I will say that he's come out and said, you know, I'm really opposed to Agenda 2030.
[03:33:59.722 --> 03:34:00.803]  That was some time ago.
[03:34:00.803 --> 03:34:02.883]  I want to be fair about that.
[03:34:02.883 --> 03:34:11.646]  But Tim, if you can play the clip on B-roll of him waving an Israeli flag as part of a victory that he's celebrating.
[03:34:12.370 --> 03:34:15.312]  That to me is absolutely terrifying.
[03:34:15.312 --> 03:34:21.957]  Imagine the Australian Prime Minister at his victory speech waving another country's flag.
[03:34:21.957 --> 03:34:23.458]  Doesn't matter which country.
[03:34:23.458 --> 03:34:26.080]  That does not make any sense to me.
[03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:27.421]  Mike, what's your take on this guy?
[03:34:28.427 --> 03:34:30.008]  Well, you make a really important point.
[03:34:30.008 --> 03:34:32.349]  Where do his loyalties lie, right?
[03:34:32.349 --> 03:34:33.809]  That's the question.
[03:34:33.809 --> 03:34:35.110]  Is he loyal to the globalists?
[03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:37.931]  Is he loyal to Israel over his own people?
[03:34:37.931 --> 03:34:43.594]  Will he represent his own people or will he sacrifice their interests for the sake of Israel?
[03:34:43.594 --> 03:34:47.055]  Now, the same question comes to the United States.
[03:34:47.055 --> 03:34:50.917]  We have many people in positions of power who are dual citizens.
[03:34:50.917 --> 03:34:54.179]  They have Israeli citizenship and United States citizenship.
[03:34:54.179 --> 03:34:57.320]  And many of those people made decisions about the pandemic, by the way.
[03:34:57.540 --> 03:35:01.621]  Many of those people are in the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, and so on.
[03:35:01.621 --> 03:35:08.682]  And you do have to reasonably ask the question that when these people make their decisions, who are they representing?
[03:35:08.682 --> 03:35:11.483]  Whose interests are at stake?
[03:35:11.483 --> 03:35:15.243]  And increasingly, as you find, they don't represent us.
[03:35:15.243 --> 03:35:17.544]  Even the Pentagon doesn't represent America.
[03:35:17.544 --> 03:35:22.945]  You notice they rush to defend Israel's borders, but they do nothing to defend America's borders.
[03:35:24.005 --> 03:35:32.909]  When do America's borders get two carrier strike groups, you know, one in the Gulf of Mexico, maybe one off the coast of California?
[03:35:32.909 --> 03:35:35.090]  When do our borders get supported by our military?
[03:35:35.090 --> 03:35:36.670]  The answer is never!
[03:35:36.670 --> 03:35:37.551]  Never!
[03:35:37.551 --> 03:35:47.114]  In fact, our federal government sends soldiers to our border to cut the fences and lift the fences and help illegals across.
[03:35:47.114 --> 03:35:48.295]  So it's very clear
[03:35:48.795 --> 03:36:01.362]  That our representatives, by and large, although there are a few exceptions obviously, but by and large, our representatives in Congress, in the State Department especially, and in the White House, absolutely do not represent the interests of the American people.
[03:36:01.362 --> 03:36:03.363]  This is a legit question to ask.
[03:36:03.363 --> 03:36:06.905]  And Maria, can I interject one more thing here real quick?
[03:36:06.905 --> 03:36:07.525]  Yes.
[03:36:07.525 --> 03:36:11.568]  Elon Musk has announced this thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters.
[03:36:11.568 --> 03:36:12.768]  This is good news.
[03:36:14.827 --> 03:36:21.491]  To say that X or Twitter is a free speech platform, give me a break!
[03:36:21.491 --> 03:36:24.473]  Where is Alex Jones on Twitter?
[03:36:24.473 --> 03:36:26.194]  Where is the official InfoWars account?
[03:36:26.194 --> 03:36:27.475]  It's Shadowband!
[03:36:27.475 --> 03:36:29.777]  My account, Health Ranger, Shadowband!
[03:36:30.257 --> 03:36:39.400]  I actually get more response posting on my own platform, which is a fraction of the size of Twitter, obviously, than I do on Twitter, because I'm shadowbanned.
[03:36:39.400 --> 03:36:43.221]  I don't know if you're shadowbanned, but we're all still shadowbanned.
[03:36:43.221 --> 03:36:52.144]  So Elon, if you're going to sue Media Matters, why don't you start by just unleashing the power of the freedom to speak
[03:36:52.904 --> 03:36:56.830]  For the key people who can make Twitter more successful.
[03:36:56.830 --> 03:37:01.076]  That's people like Alex Jones and like myself and like you Maria.
[03:37:01.076 --> 03:37:04.220]  We can reinvigorate Twitter or X as it is now.
[03:37:04.220 --> 03:37:05.943]  So stop silencing us for God's sake.
[03:37:07.523 --> 03:37:13.108]  Yeah, I've spoken about this before, but I'm going to say it now because I told X at the time.
[03:37:13.108 --> 03:37:16.411]  I'm going to make sure I continue to mention this.
[03:37:16.411 --> 03:37:18.173]  I have an impersonator.
[03:37:18.173 --> 03:37:19.995]  I have to have it pinned on my page.
[03:37:19.995 --> 03:37:21.076]  This is my third account.
[03:37:21.076 --> 03:37:24.099]  I haven't had my former two accounts reinstated.
[03:37:24.099 --> 03:37:30.585]  I have an impersonator engaging people in financial scams on X. I notified X about this.
[03:37:30.985 --> 03:37:35.288]  And they said, oh, well, we need you to email us from your official business domain.
[03:37:35.288 --> 03:37:36.409]  So I did that.
[03:37:36.409 --> 03:37:38.851]  I emailed them from the Zmedia domain.
[03:37:38.851 --> 03:37:40.972]  Then they said, that's not enough.
[03:37:40.972 --> 03:37:42.233]  We need your government issued ID.
[03:37:44.542 --> 03:37:45.143]  You need what?
[03:37:45.143 --> 03:37:47.445]  Sorry, someone else is impersonating me.
[03:37:47.445 --> 03:37:49.688]  I am active on this account.
[03:37:49.688 --> 03:37:50.268]  They're not.
[03:37:50.268 --> 03:37:51.630]  I'm engaging with my audience.
[03:37:51.630 --> 03:37:52.070]  They're not.
[03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:56.095]  But you want my government-issued ID, you can shove it.
[03:37:56.095 --> 03:37:58.677]  And X still hasn't done anything about that.
[03:37:58.677 --> 03:38:03.523]  So, you know, my point is, Mike, and you can see there are
[03:38:04.844 --> 03:38:06.986]  Some people are very, very shadow banned.
[03:38:06.986 --> 03:38:07.547]  Still on there.
[03:38:07.547 --> 03:38:08.228]  You're one of them.
[03:38:08.228 --> 03:38:10.630]  I'm definitely one of them.
[03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:14.014]  It's not what people keep claiming it is.
[03:38:14.014 --> 03:38:15.976]  Certain accounts are elevated.
[03:38:15.976 --> 03:38:17.417]  Certain accounts are silenced.
[03:38:17.417 --> 03:38:23.964]  And from what I can see, the actual truthers, the ones who hit the nail on the head, are still suppressed.
[03:38:24.909 --> 03:38:26.390]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:38:26.390 --> 03:38:40.655]  I mean, you know, Ben Shapiro has unlimited reach, but somebody like me or Alex Jones, who is actually uncovering a far deeper truth or a higher truth, we're completely shadow banned or completely banned in the case of Alex.
[03:38:40.655 --> 03:38:49.118]  So, yeah, look, you know, Tucker Carlson has done a lot of great things with Twitter or X and reinvigorating it, and that's wonderful.
[03:38:49.858 --> 03:38:57.563]  But Tucker Carlson, as much as I admire his work, he is not the only person who can attract hundreds of millions of views.
[03:38:57.563 --> 03:39:02.626]  Alex did that with his documentaries before he was banned by YouTube and others.
[03:39:02.626 --> 03:39:07.769]  In fact, Alex's documentaries have over a billion views on YouTube before they were banned.
[03:39:07.769 --> 03:39:11.592]  So, look, you put Alex on X or Twitter,
[03:39:12.412 --> 03:39:13.713]  Man, the sky's the limit.
[03:39:13.713 --> 03:39:26.159]  And, by the way, I'll be happy to advertise on X. I'll spend easily $100,000 a month advertising on X. If Elon is afraid of losing his advertisers, I will commit.
[03:39:26.159 --> 03:39:30.762]  I'll spend $100,000 a month advertising on X right now for my store.
[03:39:30.762 --> 03:39:33.923]  And I'm sure there's a lot of other people who will support X financially that way as well.
[03:39:33.923 --> 03:39:36.184]  So I just wanted to get that in there and mention that.
[03:39:36.184 --> 03:39:38.766]  It has to be mentioned.
[03:39:38.766 --> 03:39:40.427]  X is not a free speech platform.
[03:39:40.427 --> 03:39:40.727]  Not yet.
[03:39:42.284 --> 03:39:46.827]  Yeah, I agree with you, Mike, and very noble of you to support that.
[03:39:46.827 --> 03:39:50.029]  I think a lot of conservatives are actually saying that right now.
[03:39:50.029 --> 03:39:55.412]  They're saying, we will foot that bill if we can continue to have a free speech platform.
[03:39:55.412 --> 03:40:00.435]  But these people are under the illusion, many of them, that it's currently a free speech platform when it's fully not.
[03:40:02.257 --> 03:40:06.804]  But in any case, it is better than what we've had thus far.
[03:40:06.804 --> 03:40:10.609]  I'm personally not happy with just settling, Mike.
[03:40:10.609 --> 03:40:14.015]  We're at a point where the world does not want leftist
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:21.683]  Derangement syndrome and globalism are wildly unpopular.
[03:40:21.683 --> 03:40:24.704]  Even when you talk to normies about this stuff, they're terrified.
[03:40:24.704 --> 03:40:25.905]  They don't want it.
[03:40:25.905 --> 03:40:29.307]  You describe the dystopian future, and I do this as often as I can.
[03:40:29.307 --> 03:40:32.909]  I talk to regular people, you know, on the street, in the shops, whatever.
[03:40:32.909 --> 03:40:35.370]  I can't keep my mouth shut, Mike.
[03:40:35.370 --> 03:40:38.752]  And so you talk to them about this future that they're building and they don't want it.
[03:40:38.752 --> 03:40:41.634]  It is so unpopular.
[03:40:42.094 --> 03:40:51.576]  And so the solution now, Kathy Hochul, I want to play this clip from Kathy right before the break and then we'll continue on the other side, team, if you can line that up.
[03:40:51.576 --> 03:41:03.099]  The solution is really to indoctrinate people, children, from K-12 to make sure that we inoculate them against hatred.
[03:41:03.099 --> 03:41:07.960]  Today I'm directing the Director of Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services to develop
[03:41:09.332 --> 03:41:15.113]  Media literacy tools for K-12 in our public schools.
[03:41:15.113 --> 03:41:26.436]  This will teach students and even teachers to help understand how to spot conspiracy theories and misinformation, disinformation and online hate.
[03:41:26.436 --> 03:41:29.037]  Start talking about what we're seeing out there.
[03:41:29.037 --> 03:41:34.398]  Give the teachers the tools they need to help these conversations in school.
[03:41:36.084 --> 03:41:52.413]  And by teaching younger New Yorkers about how to discern between digital fact and digital fiction, we can better inoculate them from hatred and the spread of it, and help prepare them for a very fast-moving and often confusing world.
[03:41:52.413 --> 03:41:54.133]  We can turn this off, team.
[03:41:54.133 --> 03:42:04.399]  So basically, the awareness is rising so much, everything we're saying is so unpopular, now we have to indoctrinate them, starting even younger.
[03:42:05.799 --> 03:42:11.261]  Yeah, well, according to Hochul there, you know, digital hate is anything that she doesn't want people to be able to say.
[03:42:11.261 --> 03:42:19.445]  Digital hate would be criticism of her governorship, by the way, and her policies, which I would describe her policies as hateful against the human race.
[03:42:19.445 --> 03:42:32.490]  I mean, she's spewing hate every day in her vaccine mandates and trying to take away the Second Amendment rights of the people of New York and also surveilling and spying on the people of New York by monitoring their social media accounts.
[03:42:32.490 --> 03:42:34.671]  That's a form of government hatred against the people.
[03:42:35.271 --> 03:42:41.914]  She is Queen Hate of New York City, but she would say that I'm spewing hatred to even criticize her on that.
[03:42:41.914 --> 03:42:48.517]  So, hey, the truth is going to come out, but I know we got to go to break here.
[03:42:48.517 --> 03:42:53.739]  Yeah, yeah, we'll go to break and we'll talk about the potential consequences of all this truth coming out.
[03:42:53.739 --> 03:42:54.419]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.419 --> 03:42:55.320]  We're here with Mike Adams.
[03:42:57.458 --> 03:43:00.600]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:06.044]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.

[03:44:05.437 --> 03:44:10.919]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[03:44:10.919 --> 03:44:15.881]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[03:44:17.242 --> 03:44:22.086]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[03:47:14.298 --> 03:47:17.740]  We're on our last segment here with Mike Adams.
[03:47:17.740 --> 03:47:22.082]  So, so value your time, Mike, today and all of your input.
[03:47:22.082 --> 03:47:29.826]  I want to talk about, so just before the break, we played that clip of Cathy and basically the response of government is things are getting too out of control.
[03:47:29.826 --> 03:47:32.007]  There's too much free speech, too much free thought.
[03:47:32.667 --> 03:47:45.154]  That speech that she gave was actually a response to the viral trend this week on TikTok of people reviewing some literature from Osama Bin Laden.
[03:47:45.154 --> 03:47:52.078]  And so this was kids looking, having their worldview rocked by reading historical fact
[03:47:52.888 --> 03:48:02.433]  Uh, and all of a sudden saying, oh my goodness, we can't trust the government and in comes Cathy, uh, you know, saying, oh, these kids are being groomed to be terrorists.
[03:48:02.433 --> 03:48:03.194]  No, they're not.
[03:48:03.194 --> 03:48:06.996]  They're just realizing that the government can't be trusted.
[03:48:06.996 --> 03:48:14.740]  Well, yeah, when the government says you're not allowed to read history and they start actually removing historical documents like that letter from Osama bin Laden, which I think is 21 years old.
[03:48:16.457 --> 03:48:17.738]  That tells you something right there.
[03:48:17.738 --> 03:48:20.701]  So, I even commented on this in my own podcast.
[03:48:20.701 --> 03:48:27.246]  I said, what's so dangerous about Osama bin Laden's letter that no one should be allowed to even read it in America today?
[03:48:27.246 --> 03:48:28.887]  Why are they pulling it off everywhere?
[03:48:28.887 --> 03:48:42.859]  And actually, if you read the letter, number one, you realize that Osama bin Laden, even though, of course, I do not endorse his actions, and, you know, he is clearly radical in many ways, but he's not just some low-brow, low-IQ cave dweller as he was portrayed by the media.
[03:48:43.579 --> 03:48:46.122]  He is thoughtful in his own way.
[03:48:46.122 --> 03:48:51.407]  He has his own internal justifications for his actions and his own observations.
[03:48:51.407 --> 03:48:54.271]  Again, I'm not justifying anything he did, just to be clear.
[03:48:54.271 --> 03:48:57.954]  But he is, in his own way, a thoughtful person.
[03:48:57.954 --> 03:48:59.376]  And his commentary about the U.S.
[03:48:59.376 --> 03:49:03.000]  economy at that time was, I think, completely 100% right on.
[03:49:04.261 --> 03:49:12.326]  That the economy is driven by these warmongering corporations, while the American people are suffering with homelessness and debt and internal economic destruction.
[03:49:12.326 --> 03:49:17.750]  And think about how much worse we are now compared to where we were 21 years ago.
[03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:21.933]  So, you know, if anything, the Osama bin Laden letter was almost prophetic.
[03:49:22.373 --> 03:49:24.154]  About where America was headed today.
[03:49:24.154 --> 03:49:26.275]  So yeah, we should have a right to read it.
[03:49:26.275 --> 03:49:32.179]  Doesn't mean we're going to believe everything the man ever said or become a terrorist or follow in his footsteps.
[03:49:32.179 --> 03:49:37.702]  I mean, you're supposed to read the ideas of different people, including those with whom you disagree.
[03:49:37.702 --> 03:49:40.044]  That's the very nature of free speech in America.
[03:49:41.365 --> 03:49:44.346]  Well, I actually think that it's vital to do so.
[03:49:44.346 --> 03:49:59.629]  I listen to a lot of people that I really disagree with, Mike, just to get an understanding of their worldview and really to remind myself of what's immoral and something that I would never do and how to protect myself from ever becoming an immoral person.
[03:49:59.629 --> 03:50:09.932]  When you read through, you know, dictators of the past and you think, OK, if I have any sort of leadership in any way, I have to avoid these steps because that's what dictators do.
[03:50:09.932 --> 03:50:10.412]  I mean, this is
[03:50:10.732 --> 03:50:12.053]  This is healthy.
[03:50:12.053 --> 03:50:27.939]  And the fact is that the government doesn't trust people to have independent thought, to look at, you know, the most outrageous literature or the most outrageous speeches and make a decision for themselves about what is moral and what is just.
[03:50:27.939 --> 03:50:31.921]  And of course, you know, I think that this is because we've pushed God out of society, Mike.
[03:50:32.501 --> 03:50:35.784]  In many ways, people can't be trusted to make moral decisions.
[03:50:35.784 --> 03:50:42.330]  However, the answer is not an atheistic government or even a satanic government telling you how to think.
[03:50:42.330 --> 03:50:45.974]  Really quickly, I want to give you an example out of what's just happened in Australia.
[03:50:45.974 --> 03:50:47.595]  We've had this tragedy.
[03:50:47.595 --> 03:50:54.242]  A police commissioner's child, I believe, has been injured in some sort of an accident.
[03:50:54.942 --> 03:50:59.364]  And of course, that's tragic and our hearts go out to the family of this police commissioner.
[03:50:59.364 --> 03:51:05.867]  But what they're suggesting is a reward system now for people that don't do the wrong thing on the roads.
[03:51:05.867 --> 03:51:11.429]  So I wanted to get your take, Mike, on this social credit conditioning that's happening.
[03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:18.812]  On one hand, you have someone like Kathy Hochul, who wants to indoctrinate you from K to 12.
[03:51:18.812 --> 03:51:20.173]  She used the word inoculate.
[03:51:21.666 --> 03:51:26.989]  And at the same time, you have rewards for doing what the government wants in society.
[03:51:26.989 --> 03:51:31.491]  How do you think these two will merge in the dystopian future that they're building?
[03:51:31.491 --> 03:51:35.534]  Well, can I ask you in Australia, what's the structure of that reward system?
[03:51:35.534 --> 03:51:38.996]  What do you actually get if you don't violate laws of the road?
[03:51:38.996 --> 03:51:49.902]  I have to look at all of the details, Mike, but from what I understand, it's maybe discounted tolls or, you know, discounts on your tolls or discounts on fuel, for example.
[03:51:51.215 --> 03:51:51.816]  I see.
[03:51:51.816 --> 03:51:53.357]  All right.
[03:51:53.357 --> 03:52:04.008]  Well, I would just prefer as an American to drive on the right side of the road in Australia and see how far that gets me there.
[03:52:04.008 --> 03:52:08.513]  I'd probably end up in an Australian prison, actually acting like an American on the roads, but...
[03:52:09.133 --> 03:52:11.136]  Um, you should try driving in Texas.
[03:52:11.136 --> 03:52:23.371]  I know you've driven through Texas, where you have illegals all over the road that think the shoulder is a third lane, and they have no driver's license and no insurance, and the state highway patrol won't even write them tickets because it's pointless, right?
[03:52:23.371 --> 03:52:25.514]  So that's a whole issue right there.
[03:52:25.514 --> 03:52:26.355]  But to your point,
[03:52:27.864 --> 03:52:34.129]  This is obviously a social credit engineering system that's being rolled out, attempted to be rolled out all over the world.
[03:52:34.129 --> 03:52:47.140]  Once they tie that, or I should say in Western nations, once they tie that to the CBDCs, which is the financial leash or noose around your neck because we will all be slaves under that system, then they have complete control.
[03:52:48.061 --> 03:52:49.903]  And they'll have GPS trackers in your cars.
[03:52:49.903 --> 03:52:51.504]  They've already passed the bill in the U.S.
[03:52:51.504 --> 03:52:55.427]  Congress to have the automatic kill switches on your cars.
[03:52:55.427 --> 03:52:58.949]  As I said earlier, making you a prisoner in your own vehicle.
[03:52:58.949 --> 03:53:09.377]  And it won't be long before they can summon your vehicle to imprison you and drive you to the nearest police station to be arrested because they think that you've said something wrong on social media.
[03:53:09.377 --> 03:53:15.342]  And by the way, when Governor Hochul says that young people have to be taught to discern fact from fiction,
[03:53:17.116 --> 03:53:24.259]  The government that she runs is the number one purveyor of fiction in the state of New York.
[03:53:24.259 --> 03:53:25.999]  And at a national level, it's the U.S.
[03:53:25.999 --> 03:53:28.640]  government that spreads more fiction than anyone else.
[03:53:28.640 --> 03:53:31.861]  Practically everything they tell you is fiction.
[03:53:31.861 --> 03:53:33.562]  Oh, we didn't blow up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[03:53:34.332 --> 03:53:37.714]  Oh, we didn't have anything to do with the pandemic.
[03:53:37.714 --> 03:53:38.815]  Oh, we don't build bioweapons.
[03:53:38.815 --> 03:53:41.337]  Oh, we don't have bioweapons labs in Ukraine.
[03:53:41.337 --> 03:53:42.698]  Oh, the dollar is strong.
[03:53:42.698 --> 03:53:43.959]  The border is secure.
[03:53:43.959 --> 03:53:47.521]  You know, I mean, it's just lie after lie after lie.
[03:53:47.521 --> 03:53:50.203]  And yet they claim to have a monopoly on the truth.
[03:53:50.203 --> 03:53:57.848]  Of course, you know, thankfully, your audience, my audience, the Infowarrior audience, they know, they can sense the real truth when they see it.
[03:53:57.848 --> 03:53:59.209]  And they're not fooled by any of this.
[03:53:59.209 --> 03:54:03.372]  There's going to be a major pushback against the social credit engineering system.
[03:54:04.915 --> 03:54:05.775]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:54:05.775 --> 03:54:22.378]  So I want to ask you then, Mike, because I agree with you, there is a huge pushback already and people, you know, being debanked, Australia is now freezing bank accounts, one of the major banks, if you say something offensive online, that's sort of indirectly where this is heading.
[03:54:22.378 --> 03:54:30.140]  And so it's gotten really out of control already and people just haven't felt the full force of it yet.
[03:54:30.740 --> 03:54:34.001]  But when they do, Mike, I mean, where do you see this going?
[03:54:34.001 --> 03:54:39.984]  In the next three minutes, where do you see the people going, the globalist reaction?
[03:54:39.984 --> 03:54:45.046]  And my opinion is that really only the strong will survive.
[03:54:45.046 --> 03:54:51.469]  The people that don't emotionally react to every manufactured crisis, and believe you me, more of them are coming.
[03:54:52.912 --> 03:55:02.039]  We're going to have parallel systems, parallel economies, parallel currencies, cryptocurrency, privacy currency, you know, Monero, Bitcoin.
[03:55:02.039 --> 03:55:14.148]  You notice that the SEC just got a settlement with CZ and like a $4 billion settlement with that exchange, Binance, because they're trying to punish crypto.
[03:55:14.148 --> 03:55:20.733]  You notice Kraken has just been sued by the SEC, but Kraken is going to fight back and defend their 10 million plus customers.
[03:55:20.733 --> 03:55:22.254]  And I'm one of those customers, by the way.
[03:55:22.814 --> 03:55:26.958]  I love Kraken because I can buy privacy crypto directly on that exchange.
[03:55:26.958 --> 03:55:35.787]  Once I have private crypto or physical gold or silver in my hands or garden seeds or legal ammunition, the government can't track it.
[03:55:35.787 --> 03:55:36.868]  They don't know where it is.
[03:55:36.868 --> 03:55:40.312]  They don't know where I put it or if I gave it to somebody.
[03:55:40.312 --> 03:55:46.157]  You know, if I'm giving somebody a silver coin or a gold coin or I'm at a farmer's market and I'm buying food with silver, the government
[03:55:46.778 --> 03:55:48.659]  Doesn't know that, and they don't have a right to know that.
[03:55:48.659 --> 03:55:50.139]  It's my business.
[03:55:50.139 --> 03:55:57.741]  If I'm buying, you know, organic biscuits at a farmer's market with junk silver coins that are pre-1965, that's my business.
[03:55:57.741 --> 03:56:00.682]  Or if I'm using Bitcoin, that's my business.
[03:56:00.682 --> 03:56:08.384]  So, you're going to see so many people reject the system, the CBDCs, and the failing banks, and the failing currency, which is the dollar.
[03:56:08.384 --> 03:56:13.585]  And those people who are stupid enough to stay in the dollar system, they're going to lose everything.
[03:56:13.985 --> 03:56:17.849]  Because as I said earlier, Maria, the dollar is going to zero.
[03:56:17.849 --> 03:56:21.813]  And those people who are still holding on to the dollar, they're going to lose everything financially.
[03:56:21.813 --> 03:56:34.906]  Whereas those in gold and silver and crypto and land and things that have real value, they're going to be the new wealthy of the next society that rises up out of the ashes after the collapse of this broken system that we're currently suffering under today.
[03:56:34.906 --> 03:56:35.767]  I truly believe that.
[03:56:36.147 --> 03:56:56.954]  And that's why it is a responsibility for each and every one of us to position ourselves to protect our assets and protect our voices and protect our health so that we can rebuild a society rooted in truth, liberty, freedom, and real justice after the collapse of this system that is in its last chapter right now.
[03:56:56.954 --> 03:56:58.315]  That's kind of my summary, Maria.
[03:57:00.003 --> 03:57:03.324]  Truth, liberty, real justice and actual prosperity, Mike.
[03:57:03.324 --> 03:57:07.546]  One where we are not indebted to globalist bankers.
[03:57:07.546 --> 03:57:15.269]  One where we support one another to prosper and live well and be blessed with our children and our gardens and abundance.
[03:57:15.689 --> 03:57:17.971]  And these are things that absolutely everyone wants.
[03:57:17.971 --> 03:57:23.235]  I read some statistics about Gen Z being pro-socialist.
[03:57:23.235 --> 03:57:28.919]  I think that if people, if the world sees this model that you're talking about, Mike, they will flock to it.
[03:57:28.919 --> 03:57:34.323]  And you are doing such an amazing job in building that, Mike, in being a true pioneer for that.
[03:57:34.323 --> 03:57:39.367]  Health Ranger, Brighteon.com, thank you so much for your time today, Mike.
[03:57:39.367 --> 03:57:43.149]  Everyone, please support InfoWars and share this everywhere.
[03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.870]  God bless you all.
[03:57:47.233 --> 03:57:51.656]  First came Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[03:57:51.656 --> 03:57:55.559]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[03:57:55.559 --> 03:58:00.682]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[03:58:00.682 --> 03:58:03.044]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[03:58:03.044 --> 03:58:05.045]  I'll eat your ass!
[03:58:05.045 --> 03:58:07.827]  You Nazi scum!
[03:58:07.827 --> 03:58:10.329]  Let's free the Patriots and defeat the globalist techniques.
[03:58:11.932 --> 03:58:16.479]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[03:58:16.479 --> 03:58:19.043]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[03:58:19.043 --> 03:58:19.363]  Woo!
[03:58:26.673 --> 03:58:30.414]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[03:58:30.414 --> 03:58:33.435]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist.
[03:58:33.435 --> 03:58:37.236]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[03:58:37.236 --> 03:58:44.298]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[03:58:48.055 --> 03:58:51.196]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:58:51.196 --> 03:58:53.496]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:58:53.496 --> 03:58:57.437]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:58:57.437 --> 03:59:06.360]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:59:06.360 --> 03:59:13.242]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:59:13.242 --> 03:59:14.142]  It's really just incredible.
[03:59:15.180 --> 03:59:18.041]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:59:18.041 --> 03:59:24.602]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:59:24.602 --> 03:59:27.643]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:59:27.643 --> 03:59:36.565]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:59:36.565 --> 03:59:40.146]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:59:40.847 --> 03:59:45.834]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:59:45.834 --> 03:59:48.679]  Please take action now.
[03:59:48.679 --> 03:59:54.588]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
