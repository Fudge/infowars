[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.730]  Let's get right down to brass tacks.
[00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.193]  We've got this serious tragic situation in Maine.
[00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:10.537]  Another, we believe the official story, lunatic.
[00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.460]  Because they advertise everywhere that mass shooting is a thing.
[00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:19.603]  It's entered into the consciousness like a suit you can go buy at the store.
[00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.785]  It's an option like, oh get a red car, blue car, or black car.
[00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:24.487]  Maybe a white car, maybe a gray car.
[00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:28.848]   Why just have suicide by cop where you can just go kill a bunch of people?
[00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:42.368]   Army Reserve, completely mentally ill, been in a mental institution last
[00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:47.728]   year for saying he was going to blow up and shoot up the military base.
[00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.527]  In almost every case, these guys say they're going to go do this.
[00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.450]  And nothing is done.
[00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:08.793]   If you're running around saying you're going to blow up a military base and you are a military firearms instructor, Your ass needs to go to the mental institution for 10 years and get the Thorazine treatment.
[00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:14.377]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:21.236]  worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:40.236]  [Music]
[00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:42.077]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:48.803]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:53.988]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:57.310]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.112]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.202]  What a beautiful setup!
[00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:07.711]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:12.631]   Visit info wars.com forward slash show and share the link today
[00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:44.337]   It's Thursday October 26 2020 We have a jam-packed, very important transmission as always, but particularly today, Vivek Ramaswamy will be joining us in the second hour to cover the waterfront.
[00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:51.800]  And then Patrick Byrne has the inside scoop on the escalating war in the Middle East.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.601]  You do not want to miss any of this transmission.
[00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:57.802]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:02.585]  Our answer to the Great Reset Tyranny of the New World Order is The Great Awakening.
[00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:03.905]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:10.550]  I want to air a 13 and a half minute clip coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:22.499]  Tucker Carlson, where he really knocked it out of the park in a recent speech he gave yesterday, where he breaks down the fact that everyone knows something bad is happening and things are about to get worse.
[00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:30.375]   And then he lays out how the social contract with the people of the West has been deliberately broken By the establishment.
[00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:33.257]  But he doesn't go far enough.
[00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:38.362]  So I want to introduce the clip and then add the rest of the story.
[00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:39.763]  And I'm not putting Tucker down.
[00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:43.447]  And, you know, I talked to Tucker quite a bit privately.
[00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:46.409]  I mean, he understands the big picture, but I don't think he wants people to lose hope.
[00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:50.133]  But at the same time, you just got to be completely honest with people.
[00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:54.677]  And that is the globalists don't just not care about us.
[00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:57.347]  They want to hurt us.
[00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:58.908]  They want to depopulate us.
[00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:01.508]  That means they want to kill us.
[00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.289]  We don't just have a disconnected, out-of-control, globalist elite that doesn't care.
[00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.490]  They know exactly what they're doing, though Tucker's absolutely right.
[00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:24.752]  What they've set up is going to blow up in their face, and there's a good chance they'll destroy all life on the surface of the planet.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.780]  In the process of that.
[00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:28.301]  Okay.
[00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:29.782]  So.
[00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.423]  Let's get right down to brass tacks.
[00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:36.865]  We've got this serious, tragic situation in Maine.
[00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.226]  Another, we believe the official story, lunatic.
[00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:46.148]  Because they advertise everywhere that mass shooting is a thing.
[00:04:46.728 --> 00:04:50.290]  It's entered into the consciousness like a suit you can go buy at the store.
[00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.471]  It's an option, like, oh, get a red car, a blue car, a black car.
[00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.112]  Maybe a white car, maybe a gray car.
[00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:59.527]   Why just have suicide by cop where you can just go kill a bunch of people?
[00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:13.048]   Army Reserve, completely mentally ill, been in a mental institution last
[00:05:13.048 --> 00:05:18.487]   year for saying he was gonna blow up and shoot up the military base.
[00:05:18.698 --> 00:05:22.180]  In almost every case, these guys say they're going to go do this.
[00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:27.142]  And nothing is done.
[00:05:27.923 --> 00:05:39.506]  If you're running around saying you're going to blow up a military base and you are a military firearms instructor, your ass needs to go to the mental institution for 10 years and get the Thorazine treatment.
[00:05:41.646 --> 00:05:43.307]  But of course, they didn't do that.
[00:05:45.107 --> 00:05:49.248]  And now 22 people are dead, 60 plus wounded, and they're going to blame gun owners for this?
[00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:50.549]  No, that's why we need guns.
[00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:57.129]  To protect ourselves from this reported, they say he did it, he may be innocent, but if the story's true.
[00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.390]  And I got a lot of angles to talk about.
[00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:04.631]  All right, I was just on his show, it's gone viral, Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:08.672]  And he's going to be live with us coming up next hour.
[00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:11.113]  Patrick Burns got the inside scoop.
[00:06:11.493 --> 00:06:12.233]  I really respect him.
[00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:18.415]  Makes a lot of sense what he's saying on what's happening in Israel, the Middle East, what happened with the stand down.
[00:06:21.386 --> 00:06:25.508]  On October 7th, he'll be joining us coming up.
[00:06:26.408 --> 00:06:29.689]  We got the anti-Israeli view yesterday with Nick Fuentes.
[00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.071]  We'll get the pro-Israeli view with Patrick Byrne.
[00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:39.953]  We're trying to give you all the different angles here, unlike the corporate media and unlike some of the independent media.
[00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:42.234]  I'm not attacking independent media that wants to take a side.
[00:06:42.975 --> 00:06:45.095]  I'm trying to have a 35,000-foot view here.
[00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:48.637]  And boy, there have been a lot of big developments on that front.
[00:06:49.625 --> 00:07:09.381]  Huge developments on the war front also in Ukraine, big developments in the Democratic Party eating its own, and more and more statements by the Attorney Generals of different states like Letitia James saying white people are inherently evil, and so is the ADL.
[00:07:10.402 --> 00:07:13.965]  They teach that, but then they wonder why then the brown people are attacking the Jews.
[00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:15.246]  Well, you look white to them.
[00:07:15.266 --> 00:07:18.729]  So we've got some chilling clips of that.
[00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:26.039]  Also, remember the disgusting Las Vegas teens that ran over the retired police chief because he was white and killed him?
[00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:32.521]  Well, now they flipped off the family of the police chief they killed and are basically celebrating with a video of that.
[00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.601]  What nice people!
[00:07:35.802 --> 00:07:38.302]  But, I mean, he's white though, so he deserves to die.
[00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:40.763]  That's what Leticia James basically says.
[00:07:40.823 --> 00:07:46.145]  White people are inherently bad because they have light skin.
[00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:46.865]  That's a quote.
[00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:53.396]  And of course, George Soros financed her and put her into power.
[00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:58.618]  So, yeah, let's flip off the family of the guy you ran over and killed for fun.
[00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:04.781]  I got a feeling that those guys are gonna have a lot of fun in prison.
[00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:11.384]  Because even quote, run-of-the-mill criminals are sick of this type of indiscriminate murder.
[00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:23.661]  You know, there's so many videos we never even get to because I just have so much other news, but I'm going to really start delving into all the footage of black-on-white attacks in this country that the media basically covers up.
[00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:26.784]  And imagine if the shoe was on the other foot, how people would feel.
[00:08:27.204 --> 00:08:33.070]  I don't want to randomly run over some black person jogging or riding a bicycle down the side of the road.
[00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:35.192]  Oh, look, there's a black person here.
[00:08:35.232 --> 00:08:36.153]  Let me just run them over.
[00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:41.068]  But it's acceptable now in America with many people.
[00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:45.290]  So we're going to be looking at that and tying it into Israel and all the things that are unfolding there.
[00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:55.574]  Also, there's a big report going around everywhere that Israel, working with the Delta Force, and then the articles say with the Navy.
[00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:57.835]  No, the Delta Force is not with the Navy, it's the Army.
[00:08:59.175 --> 00:09:00.936]  Though you can try out from any branch of the military.
[00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.557]  They're planning to, quote, nerve gas the tunnels.
[00:09:04.497 --> 00:09:06.158]  Well, that is international war crime.
[00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:21.197]  But then I did a little more research and remembered that Delta Force has done training, it's not classified, in hostage situations to spray opiate gas into tunnels or houses where hostages are to knock everybody out and then you can go in and save the hostages.
[00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:36.265]   So I made some phone calls, I'll leave it at that, and was told indeed That basically, that's what Eric Prince was talking about Saturday, when we were hypothetically saying, how could the Israelis go in and not cause massive casualties, both civilian and their own?
[00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:38.746]  And Prince was like, well, there's some other options.
[00:09:39.407 --> 00:09:42.248]  And he didn't tell me this, but that, that is the option.
[00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:56.868]   And it is to pump, not nerve gas into the tunnels, but high powered, basically aerosolized You don't want to do fentanyl, that'll kill a bunch of
[00:09:56.868 --> 00:09:57.328]  people.
[00:09:57.328 --> 00:10:01.528]   And of course it was declassified in 2000 that the Marine Corps was training to pacify
[00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:07.168]   riots in US cities using helicopters and/or drones, that's 23 years ago, they already
[00:10:07.168 --> 00:10:13.448]   used the term drones, to deliver high-powered opiate gases to knock out rioting crowds.
[00:10:13.448 --> 00:10:19.088]   So we'll just get tomorrow's news today, and I'm not defending Israel, just to defend Israel.
[00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.631]  And it's okay if you want to defend Israel.
[00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:27.495]  What I'm saying is, when I report these things, it's because it's the information we have, we want to be as accurate as possible.
[00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.456]  I find it hard to believe that Israel...
[00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:36.758]  He's going to pump nerve gas in and then, quote, save the hostages by pumping nerve gas in.
[00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:45.520]  Because if you kill the hostage takers with nerve gas and they're right next to the people who are the hostages, what does the nerve gas do to them?
[00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:52.142]  And real nerve gas, VX, you name it, it doesn't matter if you're wearing protective gear, you're dead.
[00:10:52.222 --> 00:10:53.302]  It'll get through anything.
[00:10:53.902 --> 00:10:56.143]  One micron of it gets through a crack.
[00:10:56.263 --> 00:11:01.873]   It'll go through your skin and you're going to be seizing up And convulsing to death.
[00:11:01.973 --> 00:11:07.997]  So the story that's even in the mainstream news, in my view, is absolute crap.
[00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:09.698]  Again, use your heads.
[00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:14.041]  Totally illegal, war crime, but it's worse.
[00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:14.601]  U.S.
[00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:20.105]  military that's a signatory to that is going to help the Israelis use nerve gas that's going to kill the hostages.
[00:11:21.286 --> 00:11:26.550]  Again, it's war propaganda, it's preposterous, and it's even in the Israeli news.
[00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:38.998]  Now, if Netanyahu's crazy enough to save his hostages, save the Israeli hostages and other hostages, with lethal nerve gas, well, then, man, the IQs have dropped about 100 points in Israel.
[00:11:39.638 --> 00:11:41.460]  So, I don't think that's happened.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.743]  So, there's no way the story's true.
[00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:57.341]   So, we do know that Hamas and Hezbollah have been caught making nerve gas, and they got caught using it, and the US and Israel, by the way, were backing the jihadis against Assad.
[00:11:57.361 --> 00:12:11.708]  And so the only use of nerve gas, chlorine gas, was by ISIS when the West was backing them against the Syrian regime of Assad.
[00:12:13.325 --> 00:12:16.889]  So I've kind of already covered that, but there's a big stack on that area.
[00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:19.752]  Netanyahu, we are the people of the light, they are the people of the darkness.
[00:12:20.893 --> 00:12:24.336]  Trump issues warning to Americans about the fight in Gaza, says it is coming here.
[00:12:24.356 --> 00:12:25.497]  I agree, it already has.
[00:12:26.318 --> 00:12:27.279]  Israel-Palestine war.
[00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:29.622]  Israel plans to flood Hamas tunnels with nerve gas.
[00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:35.548]  Report Israel planning to flood Hamas tunnels with nerve gas under U.S.
[00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.549]  Navy supervision.
[00:12:38.743 --> 00:12:41.526]  The article says the Navy Delta Force.
[00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:42.947]  This is just not true.
[00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:44.449]  It's not true.
[00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:47.832]  It's like saying the Washington Cowboys.
[00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:54.800]  If you want to understand foreign policy, there's a clip that Cernovich has put out, breaking down what's happening.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.381]  I'm going to play that.
[00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:58.844]  Amongst fighters trained in Iran before October 7th attacks.
[00:12:59.384 --> 00:13:00.165]  I've seen the training.
[00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:01.406]  I've seen what the Iranians do.
[00:13:02.027 --> 00:13:04.669]  And I agree that Iran admits they've been funding it.
[00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:07.612]  And I said that day one that I believe Iran was behind it.
[00:13:07.652 --> 00:13:08.913]  That doesn't mean I want to go to war with Iran.
[00:13:09.273 --> 00:13:10.554]  I'm just telling you what I think.
[00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:11.815]  And I'm not always right.
[00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:13.337]  So, just telling you what I think.
[00:13:14.884 --> 00:13:20.526]  And I said on October 7th, Israel will end up blaming Iran and I predict will bomb Iran.
[00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.928]  Probably just military targets and kill some of their leadership like we saw Trump do.
[00:13:25.628 --> 00:13:26.289]  And we'll see.
[00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:27.209]  I'm right again.
[00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:33.051]  Before and after satellite images show Gaza's destruction, we'll be getting to that.
[00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:36.553]  We've got the open border news here as well.
[00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:38.874]  Biden has let in that they admit it's much higher.
[00:13:40.138 --> 00:13:40.758]  More people.
[00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:46.240]  The number of illegals who've invaded under Biden is larger than the population of 38 states.
[00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:51.142]  So we're going to be getting to all of that.
[00:13:51.182 --> 00:13:53.203]  Of course, a great graphic that really says it all.
[00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:56.444]  It's an image of an aircraft carrier strike force group.
[00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:03.127]  And it says for Israel's border, you've got a carrier strike force group.
[00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:04.367]  And for the U.S.
[00:14:04.407 --> 00:14:05.648]  border, you've got a guy on a horse.
[00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:14.594]  If he whips his horse with a rope to make it go through the water, they claim he's whipping the black quote migrants.
[00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:17.415]  So we're going to be looking at all the angles of that.
[00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:26.461]  We've had more Jews attacked and cornered around the country inside restaurants, inside grocery stores, inside colleges.
[00:14:26.481 --> 00:14:30.903]  I think any group being targeted for what group they are and attacked is wrong.
[00:14:31.524 --> 00:14:37.781]   And we've got The media defending that and saying, well, you know, they deserve it.
[00:14:38.842 --> 00:14:40.364]  Very, very dangerous situation there.
[00:14:40.384 --> 00:14:49.893]  And you've got more riots around the country with Hamas, Hezbollah sympathizers just blocking roads and pulling white people out of their cars and beating them up.
[00:14:50.373 --> 00:14:50.733]  Because, hey!
[00:14:51.653 --> 00:14:53.475]  Jews are white, so this is an old white man.
[00:14:53.515 --> 00:14:54.696]  Let's just beat him up, too.
[00:14:55.397 --> 00:14:57.739]  Hey, there's an old retired police chief on a bicycle.
[00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:58.640]  Let's just kill him.
[00:14:59.281 --> 00:14:59.761]  Why not?
[00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:00.422]  Everybody knows.
[00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:03.945]  Letitia James said white people are inherently evil.
[00:15:06.007 --> 00:15:10.532]  So why don't we come back and get into some of those clips when we return on the other side?
[00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:13.682]  I told you the last big sale was ending.
[00:15:14.643 --> 00:15:16.244]  The next big sale is here.
[00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:31.054]  The only thing we're keeping is, or adding, I'm sorry, this is new, not BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra is 60% off, immune support, organic green fibers, vitamin D3 gummies, down and out sleep support, wholesome multivitamins, super full of vitality, all massively discounted.
[00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:32.435]  The new sale is up and live.
[00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:34.256]  Check it out today at FullWorksStore.com.
[00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:40.956]  All right, I'm going to get into the left and their open race war they're trying to start.
[00:15:41.296 --> 00:15:44.838]  And Leticia James saying that white people are inherently evil because of their skin color.
[00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.699]  That's the Attorney General persecuting Trump in New York.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:57.603]  But I want to get into the tragic events that we have just seen unfold in Maine.
[00:15:59.064 --> 00:16:01.545]  There's a lot of different angles to this and a lot of different takeaways.
[00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:10.635]  You have an individual, and they're saying they think it's him, even Mainstream News is calling him the shooter, but I think we can still say that's alleged.
[00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:11.735]  That's how our system works.
[00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:18.341]  Maine Massacre gunman Robert Card, that's the Daily Mail, was committed to a mental hospital after hearing voices.
[00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:25.927]  Firearms instructor, military firearms instructor, spent two weeks in a mental health facility this summer before killing at least 22 people.
[00:16:25.987 --> 00:16:27.128]  Now they're saying the number's down to 18.
[00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:28.649]  I hope that's correct.
[00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.531]  More than 60 wounded.
[00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:32.804]  More than 60 wounded.
[00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:45.308]  And then they talk about the entire state of Maine being on lockdown because he is at large, but now they think he went across the border to Massachusetts.
[00:16:46.668 --> 00:16:50.609]  So the answer is armed citizens, not disarmed citizens.
[00:16:50.629 --> 00:17:03.466]   And even though mass shootings are statistically up, because they didn't really happen until the 1980s, It's still a very rare form of dying, but nonetheless terrible if you're wounded or killed.
[00:17:04.947 --> 00:17:11.134]  So, again, is this MKUltra?
[00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:12.675]  Was he a mind control subject?
[00:17:13.556 --> 00:17:14.897]  We don't know that, and you know why?
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.806]  Because the CIA, under that program, MKUltra, MKNaomi and others, admittedly trained people to be assassins and mass shooters.
[00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:27.749]  And we know Sirhan Sirhan was drugged up and was just a decoy shooter.
[00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:28.469]  That's come out.
[00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.071]  And I'm not saying this was MKUltra.
[00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:32.052]  I'm not saying that.
[00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:41.659]  I'm saying, because there's a history of that, and Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, was involved with the CIA, so was his family.
[00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:43.140]  That's in mainstream news.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.560]  Look it up.
[00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:47.923]  The Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, was in the MKUltra program.
[00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.663]  Source, Washington Post, L.A.
[00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:50.023]  Times.
[00:17:50.604 --> 00:18:00.088]  The stories are so old, you just have to go to the search engine and type in Unabomber's CIA and then click images and you'll see L.A.
[00:18:00.128 --> 00:18:01.348]  Times, Washington Post.
[00:18:02.129 --> 00:18:04.890]  You can even see newscasts from the 90s about it as well.
[00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.191]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:20.073]   The shooter at the Aurora movie theater, the Batman shooters, Dad ran the government brain interface program and he was a volunteer in a mind control experiment.
[00:18:20.113 --> 00:18:21.774]  I'm not saying that's what happened there.
[00:18:22.495 --> 00:18:25.277]  I'm just saying it's weird this continues to go on.
[00:18:25.357 --> 00:18:27.098]  So we need to investigate.
[00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:34.665]  We need to look into here exactly who this individual is, Robert Card of Maine.
[00:18:37.707 --> 00:18:39.388]  But he's now wanted on murder charges.
[00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:43.389]   They've issued the warrant with at least 18 Dead.
[00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.251]  Some press reports are 22.
[00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:46.552]  We hope that's not the case.
[00:18:47.633 --> 00:18:54.918]  But the bigger takeaway here is, how could they lock down the huge state of Maine and say, stay in your house?
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.362]  Are you staying in your house because there's other criminals out there?
[00:18:59.962 --> 00:19:02.945]  Maine only had 22 homicides in all of last year.
[00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:05.186]  It's one of the safest states in the country.
[00:19:06.147 --> 00:19:06.807]  Beautiful state.
[00:19:07.727 --> 00:19:13.309]  I was just up there recently and very, very sad, but they're now calling to take your guns, take my guns.
[00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:22.291]  And of course, in the final equation, it's known psychology that when you have a mass shooting, there's more mass shootings.
[00:19:23.352 --> 00:19:24.772]  Because it enters into the mind.
[00:19:25.272 --> 00:19:26.232]  It makes it an option.
[00:19:27.313 --> 00:19:31.854]  They noticed this back in the 30s and things at the Empire State's building when it was built.
[00:19:32.697 --> 00:19:35.659]  That when one person jumped, they had to put up fencing at the top.
[00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:41.103]  Suddenly more people would hear about it and they would, suddenly in a day or so, two or three more people would show up to kill themselves.
[00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:45.286]  Or if the press reported on somebody jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, suddenly others would come.
[00:19:45.326 --> 00:19:46.226]  Yeah, that's an idea!
[00:19:47.307 --> 00:19:49.408]  So you have copycats, that's why they have a name for it.
[00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:59.148]   And the more this gets covered and the more attention there is, the more crazy people What do you want to bet he was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs?
[00:19:59.188 --> 00:20:09.322]  It says on the insert of all the major SSRIs since the 90s that it's directly linked to mass murder, megalomania, delusions of grandeur, and suicide, and a bunch of other things.
[00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:28.184]  So even aquatic life from the runoff of the Mississippi River, there's so much of the chemicals in antidepressants going into the Gulf of Mexico that in the areas where they've tested the fish and shrimp, shrimp will go up and start attacking a fish or a bird that's going to eat it.
[00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:30.845]  It just makes them like psychotic zombies.
[00:20:31.745 --> 00:20:33.166]  A small percentage of them.
[00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.907]  Others just are docile and don't care and won't evade.
[00:20:36.927 --> 00:20:38.608]  You don't think I'm telling the truth.
[00:20:38.688 --> 00:20:39.369]  It sounds insane.
[00:20:39.389 --> 00:20:40.129]  Just search engine.
[00:20:41.434 --> 00:20:46.017]  Wildlife becomes reckless after ingesting runoff of SSRIs.
[00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:51.040]  Shrimp becomes suicidal when ingesting SSRIs.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.901]  Shrimp become violent.
[00:20:53.041 --> 00:20:55.182]  I mean, they actually did federal studies on shrimp alone.
[00:20:55.202 --> 00:20:57.243]  I'm not joking.
[00:20:57.263 --> 00:21:01.506]  They even got shrimp on treadmills, a $15 million study they did as well.
[00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:04.147]  Guys, look up for the video of the shrimp on a treadmill.
[00:21:04.468 --> 00:21:05.508]  People don't believe it when I say it.
[00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:22.099]  There's a small percentage of people, you put them on these, and they go into like a dream state, and then when they have a weird thought, or they hear a weird thought, it makes them highly suggestible, that's basic psychology, and they go out and they do it.
[00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:24.319]  Suggestibility is very simple.
[00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:25.900]  Now there's a shrimp on the treadmill.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.420]  That was like a $14-$15 million study from memory if you look it up.
[00:21:33.496 --> 00:21:35.697]  And then they've tested this stuff on them and seen what it does.
[00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:40.978]  They then tested it in the ocean and, you know, tested the blood of the different animals.
[00:21:41.058 --> 00:21:47.200]  And it makes them either not care, that happens to a large percentage, and just be careless.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.620]  That's why they said make shrimp commit suicide.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.241]  They'll just swim right up to a fish or a bird that's bigger than them.
[00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:54.042]  But others start attacking.
[00:21:54.842 --> 00:21:55.782]  Fish start attacking.
[00:21:55.822 --> 00:21:56.802]  Birds start attacking.
[00:21:57.122 --> 00:21:57.963]  Shrimp start attacking.
[00:21:58.823 --> 00:22:02.704]  And you put, what is it, 60 million Americans last time I checked?
[00:22:04.312 --> 00:22:04.852]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:10.197]  Antidepressants in waterways may make crayfish boulder, increasing risks of being eaten by predators.
[00:22:11.758 --> 00:22:13.299]  That's just a study on crayfish.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.861]  But it's also studies on shrimp.
[00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:33.315]  So, no matter how crazy it sounds, folks, I'm telling you the truth here, and normal suggestibility is you see an advertisement for a steakhouse and a sizzling steak and a big juicy baked potato and a side salad, and you go, man, I'm hungry, that looks good, I'm going to the steakhouse.
[00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:43.606]  Or you see a beer commercial at the beach, and you know, ice cold beer and beautiful girls playing volleyball, and you think, man, I'd love to be at the beach with beautiful girls playing volleyball, plus the beer sounds good.
[00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:46.069]  I'm gonna go down to the 7-Eleven and get a six-pack.
[00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.973]  Yeah, there's mass shooters and psychiatric medications.
[00:22:51.493 --> 00:22:54.015]  Almost every one of them was on them.
[00:22:55.636 --> 00:23:00.761]  So, we know what's going on, and the answer's not taking good people's guns.
[00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:03.650]  You know, we got an office full of people.
[00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.170]  They got concealed carry.
[00:23:05.411 --> 00:23:06.951]  We just say, don't have it out in the open.
[00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.632]  Don't brandish it.
[00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:09.173]  You want to have it in your briefcase?
[00:23:09.193 --> 00:23:10.153]  You want to have it on your side?
[00:23:10.173 --> 00:23:12.774]  This place is an armed camp.
[00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:14.135]  And we got armed security as well.
[00:23:14.595 --> 00:23:15.476]  Feels super secure.
[00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:23.840]  But if we had employees start talking about shooting people, they're going to be let go like that.
[00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:32.530]   And if they ever come, and it's never happened, and they ever come back around, well, we're going to be, you know, Watch him.
[00:23:33.031 --> 00:23:36.013]  This guy said he was going to blow up the military base, reportedly.
[00:23:36.693 --> 00:23:37.214]  Allegedly.
[00:23:37.534 --> 00:23:38.735]  And that he was going to shoot it up.
[00:23:39.315 --> 00:23:41.597]  So they put him in the mental institution for two weeks.
[00:23:42.217 --> 00:23:43.018]  And then let him go.
[00:23:43.118 --> 00:23:45.359]  You better believe he was on SSRIs.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.542]  We don't know that, but I think it's a very safe bet.
[00:23:49.582 --> 00:23:50.343]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:23:50.363 --> 00:23:53.545]  Come back with the huge Tucker Carlson news and so much more.
[00:23:53.585 --> 00:23:54.786]  Don't forget our new sales here.
[00:23:54.826 --> 00:23:55.807]  Brain Force Ultra.
[00:23:56.147 --> 00:23:59.429]  Fast acting, really clean, really strong, and goes away in about three hours.
[00:23:59.469 --> 00:24:02.952]  So I like it because I could take it at night if I got to work some more, but then still sleep good.
[00:24:03.152 --> 00:24:05.174]  It's really an amazing special nootropic.
[00:24:05.614 --> 00:24:07.355]  It's back in stock, 60% off.
[00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:13.200]  Immune support, organic green fibers, vitamin D3 gummies, down and out sleep support, holds multivitamins, super female vitality.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.401]  They're all back in stock and discounted.
[00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:16.054]  One more point.
[00:24:16.134 --> 00:24:22.640]  I'll get into this more next hour with Vivek Ramaswamy about this mass shooter in Maine that they locked the state down.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.661]  Looks like he's not even in the state.
[00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:38.716]  Look how one guy can bring a whole system to its knees and imagine the tens of thousands of Hezbollah and Hamas that they admit are inside this country and what's going to happen if they pull each of them what he just did.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:54.964]  Tens of thousands dead, total bedlam, and then they're going to set up more security services to come after the American people and conservatives and Christians and take more of our freedoms and the government won't even get in trouble for bringing these people in.
[00:24:55.004 --> 00:24:57.905]  An incredible video I'm going to get to after Vivek Ramaswamy leaves us.
[00:24:58.666 --> 00:25:09.189]  The head of the illegal alien migrant program admits to turning loose hundreds of thousands of children to people and not even keeping track of them, facilitating the largest child trafficking ring in American history.
[00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:09.769]  That's a quote.
[00:25:11.263 --> 00:25:18.227]  And that she was even told by the head, Mayorkas, and his deputy, I want an assembly line.
[00:25:18.368 --> 00:25:22.510]  I want them turned loose to people even quicker.
[00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:26.513]  And that segues us into the Tucker Carlson video I'm about to play.
[00:25:26.813 --> 00:25:27.834]  It's posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:27.894 --> 00:25:29.214]  If you want to see it, share it.
[00:25:29.234 --> 00:25:34.498]  If you're a radio listener, Tucker Carlson warns, really dramatic, abrupt change is coming.
[00:25:35.338 --> 00:25:36.199]  Steve Watson article.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.104]  And it's very important what he's saying, but I wanted to tell the rest of the story.
[00:25:41.925 --> 00:25:43.887]  He keeps saying the elites don't care about us.
[00:25:44.688 --> 00:25:48.152]  No, they believe they're filling the space as the alpha apex predator.
[00:25:49.153 --> 00:25:51.135]  And they're carrying out social Darwinism.
[00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:56.702]  And so anything horrible they do to us, we deserve it, in their view, because we put up with it.
[00:25:57.563 --> 00:26:08.736]  So when we see them moving heaven and earth to give a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine and other countries, as our nation literally falls apart as inflation explodes, it's on purpose.
[00:26:08.877 --> 00:26:10.438]  It's a post-industrial world.
[00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:12.881]  They don't want you to have money to have a family or have children.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:25.827]  They want to get rid of the idea of the West and capitalism and wealth, and only want ultra-rich, who are quote, stakeholders, to live like kings, while all the rest of us are completely de-industrialized.
[00:26:25.847 --> 00:26:29.849]  And that's what Obama, again, famously told Africans, you can't have cars and air conditioning.
[00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.672]  The world will overheat, which isn't true, but he lives like a king.
[00:26:35.613 --> 00:26:36.553]  Your children are bad.
[00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:37.574]  They're really another gender.
[00:26:37.974 --> 00:26:39.375]  Your children are bad because they're white.
[00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:40.236]  They're inherently evil.
[00:26:40.356 --> 00:26:41.176]  All humans are bad.
[00:26:41.456 --> 00:26:42.217]  We're hurting the earth.
[00:26:43.217 --> 00:26:44.477]  You're being taught to hate yourself.
[00:26:44.517 --> 00:26:46.058]  You're being taught to not have a life force.
[00:26:46.098 --> 00:26:59.361]  You're being taught to literally believe the world's ending in 2030, as they've told you, because it is ending as we know it, under Agenda 2030, that's designed to reduce the population by 90%.
[00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:01.562]  This is a real thing.
[00:27:01.602 --> 00:27:03.742]  This is the central issue of our age.
[00:27:03.782 --> 00:27:04.782]  This is what's happening.
[00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:09.384]  This is the global financial plan of BlackRock that controls 88% of world money.
[00:27:11.307 --> 00:27:13.308]  And property and assets.
[00:27:14.588 --> 00:27:15.928]  This is the social credit score.
[00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:17.369]  This is you will eat the bugs and like it.
[00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:29.793]  This is Tyson Foods, the biggest food producer and quote meatpacker, saying, yeah, we just signed a billion dollar deal to make you eat bugs and to put bug protein as the breading on chicken and everything else.
[00:27:30.633 --> 00:27:31.873]  They're doing it.
[00:27:33.394 --> 00:27:36.455]  And by the way, the chitin protein is very, very toxic and poisonous.
[00:27:36.495 --> 00:27:39.776]  So it's all about demoralizing us.
[00:27:41.024 --> 00:27:57.793]  All about dominating us, all about totally controlling us, all about making us lower our standards in the West so the rest of the world doesn't aspire to those standards of a upwardly mobile society where my children are going to be better off than I was.
[00:27:58.674 --> 00:27:59.774]  No, children are bad.
[00:27:59.874 --> 00:28:00.655]  Humans are bad.
[00:28:03.134 --> 00:28:04.295]  Globalism is the answer.
[00:28:04.375 --> 00:28:11.738]  It's going to let you atone for being an evil human by changing your gender, by getting sterilized, by following all our directives because you're evil because you're white.
[00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:21.162]  Well, it's the white countries predominantly that still have the wealth and the idea of vacations and a two-car garage and medicine and being able to go to college.
[00:28:21.443 --> 00:28:23.043]  That's all being erased, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:23.263 --> 00:28:25.224]  That's why all these states are passing laws.
[00:28:26.245 --> 00:28:28.086]  Oh, it's racist to teach 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.102]  Remember Common Core decades ago?
[00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:31.662]  Now it's here.
[00:28:31.802 --> 00:28:32.622]  Totally dumbed down.
[00:28:32.683 --> 00:28:37.705]  Many school districts have 90-plus percent failure rate in reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:28:37.785 --> 00:28:38.846]  That's designed.
[00:28:39.846 --> 00:28:42.047]  Now they're saying pilots don't need to pass the old test.
[00:28:42.568 --> 00:28:44.809]  Because they're phasing out humans, it's all going to be AI.
[00:28:45.629 --> 00:28:47.450]  Again, we're being made obsolete.
[00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.752]  And to make us obsolete, they've got to get us to turn-less of human civilization.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:29:01.146]  And allow us to be replaced by the robots and the self-checkout lines and the bug farms because traditional agriculture is bad and hurts the earth and we gotta cut the trees down to save the earth.
[00:29:01.646 --> 00:29:03.247]  It's all murdering logic.
[00:29:04.268 --> 00:29:06.389]  Here's Tucker Carlson laying it all out.
[00:29:07.105 --> 00:29:23.216]  I thought early, and I actually wrote a piece now for the Daily Caller, I'm embarrassed, but for Politico, because I wanted to sort of drop a bomb into my neighbor's laps, and said, look, you may think that Trump is a ludicrous figure and, you know, you may be onto something, but fundamentally what he's saying is not crazy at all, and in fact it's necessary.
[00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:30.841]  And if you don't want to have another revolution in the country, you should probably start paying a little bit of attention to what the people beyond Washington think.
[00:29:31.782 --> 00:29:44.850]   And I thought then, that was January of 2016, I thought that that message was so rooted in common sense and also in observed reality that he would probably win, and he did.
[00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.872]  So I got a lot out of making that one call correctly in my life.
[00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:59.478]  And I really did think that we would see, say, five or six, seven years hence, a political system that more closely matched that idea.
[00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:06.203]  You know, that the works product coming out of Washington would bear a little closer resemblance to what people wanted.
[00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:07.504]  And of course the opposite happened.
[00:30:08.464 --> 00:30:12.968]  It's crazy how that idea just went away and no one actually believed in it.
[00:30:13.148 --> 00:30:15.109]  Which, that blew my mind most of all.
[00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:17.171]  Including a lot of people I thought were on my side.
[00:30:18.175 --> 00:30:21.637]  Including a lot of people who paid a lot of lip service to, you know, put the country first.
[00:30:21.797 --> 00:30:26.819]  I personally don't like the term America first because I think it is loaded, but just like, just common sense stuff.
[00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:43.292]   Like if something really dramatic in your country happens, like young people can't, I don't know, get married, you know, or buy houses, or have any hope for a future that approaches you know, the middle class upbringing they had, then you've
[00:30:43.292 --> 00:30:45.371]  got a huge problem and someone should be responding to that.
[00:30:45.371 --> 00:30:51.911]   And if your economy is like on the brink of collapse, you know, if your country is literally bankrupt, someone would
[00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:52.572]  say that.
[00:30:52.572 --> 00:30:57.872]   And if food inflation gets so crazy that, you know, people are actually complaining about it,
[00:30:57.872 --> 00:31:01.572]   at least where I live, I spend a lot of the year in rural Maine.
[00:31:01.636 --> 00:31:04.380]  That doesn't make me an expert on the people or anything.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.042]  I'm a fundamentally rich kid, obviously.
[00:31:07.123 --> 00:31:09.306]  But I do live among people who aren't rich.
[00:31:10.288 --> 00:31:13.071]  And they're, like, legit upset about what groceries cost.
[00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:13.592]  Like, for real.
[00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:14.633]  And what gas costs.
[00:31:15.697 --> 00:31:20.601]  And now that we've drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they're about to find out that it could get way higher than it is.
[00:31:21.021 --> 00:31:22.102]  So these are just real concerns.
[00:31:22.122 --> 00:31:30.188]  It doesn't mean they're the only concerns, but they can't be completely ignored, or you're going to have a volatile situation on your hands, and why wouldn't you?
[00:31:31.249 --> 00:31:37.054]  You know, angry people who feel like they have no recourse, who don't think elections are real, and they're totally right, obviously.
[00:31:37.774 --> 00:31:38.495]  Let's stop lying.
[00:31:38.515 --> 00:31:39.836]  There's a lot of truth in that.
[00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:45.591]  And those people are, you know, they have real grievances, legit grievances.
[00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:59.535]  And the only way to tamp those grievances down is not by creating some East German surveillance state, comma, which we have done, comma, or throwing people in prison for loitering outside the capital, which is their house after all.
[00:31:59.575 --> 00:32:00.736]  That doesn't work long term.
[00:32:00.776 --> 00:32:01.756]  It didn't work in Eastern Europe.
[00:32:01.776 --> 00:32:02.456]  It won't work here.
[00:32:02.957 --> 00:32:08.600]   The only thing that does work is kind of giving them not all they want, But some?
[00:32:09.321 --> 00:32:11.342]  Or how about this, let's just start with pretending you care.
[00:32:12.183 --> 00:32:13.163]  But you know what doesn't work?
[00:32:13.844 --> 00:32:16.325]  Saying we're gonna spend a hundred billion dollars on other countries.
[00:32:16.906 --> 00:32:29.314]  And I don't care how virtuous the case those countries make is, and I don't care how much I personally may agree or disagree with what those countries are doing, that is immaterial.
[00:32:29.995 --> 00:32:35.638]  The job, the moral duty of the people running a country is to look out for the people in that country.
[00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:36.439]  Period.
[00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.600]  That's always true.
[00:32:38.941 --> 00:32:52.932]  And it doesn't mean they can't help other people or whatever, but if they pay no attention whatsoever, and in a moment when every person, 350 million Americans, everyone, regardless of political affiliation, can feel that something bad's coming, everybody knows that.
[00:32:53.653 --> 00:32:54.474]  Everybody knows that.
[00:32:54.494 --> 00:33:00.699]  I mean, if you've been to church once in the last year, have you thought about the end times recently?
[00:33:00.739 --> 00:33:01.400]  Yes, you have.
[00:33:02.536 --> 00:33:03.037]  I'm serious.
[00:33:03.837 --> 00:33:07.280]  Because you can feel that abrupt change is coming and that's very disconcerting.
[00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:17.289]  And so rather than reassure people that, you know, we kind of got your back a little bit, by the way we're going to spend a hundred billion dollars on other people?
[00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:22.674]  Oh, and the border security part is purely designed to make it easier for more people to come here illegitimately.
[00:33:23.975 --> 00:33:25.156]  That's freaking scary.
[00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:26.056]  Okay?
[00:33:26.477 --> 00:33:27.518]  So I don't have TV at home.
[00:33:28.735 --> 00:33:29.457]  I don't watch TV.
[00:33:29.938 --> 00:33:31.041]  We haven't in years.
[00:33:31.061 --> 00:33:33.767]  Because my wife is fiercely opposed to television.
[00:33:35.311 --> 00:33:37.676]  But obviously I have some familiarity with the genre.
[00:33:39.002 --> 00:33:44.625]  So, I'm thinking to myself, the other day I was like, I wonder what they're saying about this on TV, but I'm just being honest, I have no way, really, of knowing.
[00:33:45.345 --> 00:34:06.134]  So today, I'm, today, this afternoon, two o'clock this afternoon, I'm in the hospital visiting a very sick relative, and in the room, and I'm very focused on this, and it's, you know, a drama familiar to everyone who has a family, and these are the saddest moments in your life, but I'm sitting there, and the TV is cranked way up, because it's a facility for older people, and no one can hear well, so when they watch TV, it's like, BAM, it's loud!
[00:34:08.035 --> 00:34:10.396]  And it's a channel that I'm familiar with.
[00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:21.241]  I guess I'm familiar with all of them, having worked at all of them, and admitted I've been fired from all of them, but um... But this is one I know well, and I'm thinking, well, I wonder what they're saying about all this.
[00:34:22.222 --> 00:34:24.643]  You know, because their job is to be, you know, opposed to this.
[00:34:25.423 --> 00:34:26.824]  And they take the White House briefing.
[00:34:27.745 --> 00:34:32.507]  And the White House briefing is just a humiliation exercise, because it's administered by the dumbest person in public life.
[00:34:32.547 --> 00:34:33.908]  Like, so dumb it's unbelievable.
[00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:36.609]  I'm not being mean, I feel sorry for her.
[00:34:37.694 --> 00:34:40.156]  By the way, intelligence is not a moral category.
[00:34:40.196 --> 00:34:41.477]  My dogs are dumb and I love them.
[00:34:42.999 --> 00:34:47.763]  So I'm not sort of judging her, but I'm just saying this is like a mouth breather, okay?
[00:34:47.903 --> 00:34:59.114]  And the whole point of her being the White House spokesmoron is to tell you that the people in charge have no respect for you, so we're going to put the dumbest possible person we can up there.
[00:35:00.151 --> 00:35:04.793]  And she's prattling on about Iran, and I'm just waiting for her.
[00:35:04.813 --> 00:35:06.573]  Like, she doesn't know Iran from Innsbruck, okay?
[00:35:06.593 --> 00:35:08.094]  She has no idea what she's talking about, right?
[00:35:08.574 --> 00:35:14.316]  And I'm literally waiting for her to say, you know, to attack Saddam Hussein, the president of Iran, okay?
[00:35:14.336 --> 00:35:18.558]  Because, literally, her shallowness has no bottom.
[00:35:19.518 --> 00:35:22.279]  It's like a Zen cone that's almost like a Kamala Harris line, actually.
[00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:27.561]  Anyway, and then they come back, and they're totally taking her seriously.
[00:35:28.732 --> 00:35:34.896]  And then the oiliest, fake admiral spokesman who ever commanded a ship can't run, literally can't run a Boston Whaler.
[00:35:34.936 --> 00:35:36.817]  He's been a flak his whole life, Admiral.
[00:35:37.278 --> 00:35:38.839]  He's a liar, and I know him personally.
[00:35:38.859 --> 00:35:41.681]  He's a liar, and everyone who's dealt with him knows he's a liar.
[00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.102]  And they're like, well, he says this.
[00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:46.364]  And the upshot is, we've got to attack Iran.
[00:35:47.865 --> 00:35:53.568]  Now, I'm thinking to myself, you know, I have no love for Iran, and I can certainly see why people want to attack Iran.
[00:35:54.189 --> 00:36:04.094]   All I'm asking is, just to put one person on TV To point out that there are consequences to the United States that may not be entirely positive to doing this.
[00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:11.117]  That maybe another moral victory, and we've won a lot of those recently, I don't know, are you guys sick of winning moral victories?
[00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:13.898]  We've won a lot of important moral victories.
[00:36:15.154 --> 00:36:23.602]  I interviewed someone the other day, a major political figure from the UK, and he's like, well, we've let all these refugees in, and it's really been a great moral victory, and I was like, I was just in your country, and it's garbage.
[00:36:23.782 --> 00:36:32.271]  I mean, it smells, and it's pathetic, and like, do you think that, I know you're psyched about your moral victory, you're good people, trust me, you're good Anglicans, I'm really so impressed by you.
[00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:34.973]  Morally, but like, has there been a downside in real terms?
[00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:38.497]  And he's like, oh, I can't answer that question, not allowed.
[00:36:39.963 --> 00:36:43.925]  So anyway, I just wanted someone to stand up and ask the obvious question.
[00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:46.467]  I'm not even arguing against a war with Iran.
[00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:49.669]  I'm merely saying there are consequences to doing that.
[00:36:49.749 --> 00:36:56.233]  One is we can't win it, probably, with the defense that we have currently.
[00:36:56.273 --> 00:36:56.953]  I think that's fair.
[00:36:58.394 --> 00:37:02.717]  But even if we could, I mean, what would happen if they mined the Straits of Hormuz?
[00:37:04.718 --> 00:37:12.922]  You know, I'm no energy expert, but I think that we would have an immediate energy shock that would send our country into an economic spiral within, like, hours.
[00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:13.762]  Okay?
[00:37:13.782 --> 00:37:16.404]  And we don't have any cushion because we burned it all.
[00:37:16.804 --> 00:37:19.585]  Because the senile guy's running for president again.
[00:37:19.605 --> 00:37:20.386]  Okay?
[00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:21.286]  And we sort of let that happen.
[00:37:21.306 --> 00:37:22.127]  Sold some of it to China.
[00:37:22.207 --> 00:37:23.027]  We sort of let it happen.
[00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:24.988]  So that's not a small thing.
[00:37:25.428 --> 00:37:27.389]  One thing Americans are not used to is being poor.
[00:37:27.549 --> 00:37:31.751]  In the rest of the world, people really worry about the economic effects of everything.
[00:37:31.851 --> 00:37:32.392]  Why wouldn't they?
[00:37:33.148 --> 00:37:34.929]  Because they're not generationally rich like us.
[00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:36.190]  But what if we ran out of money?
[00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:49.180]  At the very same moment that American society is more fractured, our social fabric is in tatters, and we've let in millions upon millions of people who have no affinity for the United States, who are merely here for the economic benefits.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.341]  Which, by the way, is not all bad, and I think a lot of them are good people.
[00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:52.202]  I'm not attacking them.
[00:37:52.442 --> 00:37:57.386]  I'm merely saying their addition does not make us a more cohesive country, it makes it a far less cohesive country.
[00:37:57.886 --> 00:37:58.126]  Okay?
[00:37:58.266 --> 00:38:00.848]  No matter how admirable they may be, and I know some of them, and I really like them.
[00:38:01.169 --> 00:38:01.369]  Okay?
[00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:04.791]  I've even met illegal aliens, I really like, I'm just being honest.
[00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:12.716]  But if you have millions upon millions of people with no loyalty to the United States who are all on public benefits and the country goes bankrupt, what happens?
[00:38:12.736 --> 00:38:19.560]  You know, last time we had a depression, the country held together because Americans had a lot in common with each other.
[00:38:20.241 --> 00:38:21.982]  But what happens next time, honestly?
[00:38:24.123 --> 00:38:26.945]  Moreover, when your country's at war, civil liberties disappear.
[00:38:26.985 --> 00:38:29.807]  And we saw this in the last 20 year war on terror.
[00:38:31.078 --> 00:38:33.861]  And I supported all that stuff, and I have egg in my face.
[00:38:34.221 --> 00:38:38.906]  Worse than that, I'm ashamed of the measures that I supported, which were of course turned against me.
[00:38:39.947 --> 00:38:44.512]  And the NSA got busted reading my text messages on Signal, which is supposedly secure.
[00:38:45.993 --> 00:38:46.754]  Spoiler alert, it's not.
[00:38:47.835 --> 00:38:51.199]  So keep the naughty pictures off Signal, okay, because they're looking at them.
[00:38:54.226 --> 00:39:08.996]  But they did that, they got caught doing it, no one resigned or even apologized, and that was all legal because of the measures we put in place the last time we were fighting the bad guys over a 20-year period that measurably weakened the country, and from which we derived nothing in the end.
[00:39:09.596 --> 00:39:14.640]  So I'm merely saying maybe we should just pause for one second to ask, could we be doing that again, but at scale?
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.021]  Not one person!
[00:39:16.401 --> 00:39:17.102]  You're not allowed!
[00:39:17.762 --> 00:39:19.723]  Because everything is some moral argument.
[00:39:19.803 --> 00:39:21.304]  Well, are you on the side of the bad guys?
[00:39:21.384 --> 00:39:21.565]  No!
[00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:30.805]  And so I look at how this is arrayed, and again, I can't tell you how disgusted I am by the behavior of people who said they were concerned and cared about the country, and clearly don't.
[00:39:31.485 --> 00:39:32.586]  Because no one asked that question.
[00:39:32.606 --> 00:39:33.507]  They're all too afraid.
[00:39:33.987 --> 00:39:41.633]  And then the other side, the wackos running around calling for, you know, the pro-Hamas people, decolonize, you know, they're mad at Israel for being white and they want to kill everybody.
[00:39:44.358 --> 00:39:47.841]  Obviously, if forced to choose, I'd go with Ben Shapiro, okay?
[00:39:48.702 --> 00:39:49.822]  But I shouldn't have to choose.
[00:39:50.583 --> 00:40:00.311]  Like, there should be the America guy in the middle, who's like, I have strong sympathies here, and, you know, morally I'm on one side, but I'm an American, and I've got a ton of kids.
[00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.052]  I'll speak for myself.
[00:40:01.152 --> 00:40:01.832]  I am an American.
[00:40:02.052 --> 00:40:02.553]  I was born here.
[00:40:02.613 --> 00:40:03.233]  I will die here.
[00:40:04.194 --> 00:40:11.950]   I have a ton of kids, and I kind of want them to be able to live here, in a country that resembles the one in which I grew up, And what about them?
[00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:13.251]  Shut up!
[00:40:14.252 --> 00:40:15.853]  Well, shut up's not good enough, actually.
[00:40:17.094 --> 00:40:32.850]   And I just, the spirit of fear, and I hate to use the term, but groupthink, that is descended upon lawmakers and, I would say, movement leaders in Washington, where no one can say something that's completely obvious, Because what, you're anti-Israel?
[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:34.411]  Well, no one's gonna call me anti-Israel!
[00:40:34.771 --> 00:40:35.531]  I like Israel!
[00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:42.073]  And one of the things I love about Israel, in addition to the fact it's beautiful and great food, took my kids there on vacation, is I like the Israelis.
[00:40:42.093 --> 00:40:43.014]  What do I like about the Israelis?
[00:40:43.054 --> 00:40:44.554]  They're proud of themselves and their country.
[00:40:44.654 --> 00:40:45.154]  I like that.
[00:40:45.314 --> 00:40:46.235]  I like secure people.
[00:40:47.775 --> 00:40:57.878]  But I don't know, I don't know a single Israeli, and I say this as a compliment from my heart, I don't know a single Israeli who would jeopardize his own country's economy or safety for another nation.
[00:40:58.799 --> 00:40:59.939]  Because they care about their nation!
[00:41:01.701 --> 00:41:02.402]  Like, what the hell?
[00:41:02.722 --> 00:41:04.183]  I'm saying this as a compliment.
[00:41:05.184 --> 00:41:07.265]  But why would we do that?
[00:41:07.486 --> 00:41:15.372]  And when I see leaders on the left and right call for refugees from Gaza to be imported here?
[00:41:16.613 --> 00:41:19.355]  They're too dangerous for other countries, but we should take them?
[00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:21.777]  What are you saying?
[00:41:22.637 --> 00:41:24.958]  What are you saying about how you feel about my country?
[00:41:25.739 --> 00:41:27.400]  You're saying you consider it a trash bin.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.220]  Throw the refuse there.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.101]  No one else wants to deal with it.
[00:41:29.121 --> 00:41:29.901]  America will deal with it.
[00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:30.582]  Well, how about no?
[00:41:31.402 --> 00:41:33.944]  How about anyone who even suggests something like that?
[00:41:33.964 --> 00:41:45.671]  Speaking, I mean, speaking of a betrayal of your country, that's just telling me everything I need to know about how you feel about the United States of America.
[00:41:45.991 --> 00:41:47.011]  And I'm disgusted by it.
[00:41:47.192 --> 00:41:48.732]  Did you even think something like that?
[00:41:48.913 --> 00:41:49.173]  Really?
[00:41:50.885 --> 00:41:53.248]  And yet that is considered like kind of within bounds.
[00:41:53.348 --> 00:41:55.911]  I noticed there's a few Republicans are like, well, that could happen.
[00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:59.135]  And we're going to pass legislation preemptively to make sure it doesn't.
[00:42:00.297 --> 00:42:02.059]  It's like, why would we even have that conversation?
[00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:03.201]  That is truly nuts.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:04.980]  It's nuts.
[00:42:05.761 --> 00:42:10.964]  And more than anything, it's revealing of an attitude that is poisonous and that everyone else in the country can feel.
[00:42:11.604 --> 00:42:12.144]  They know it.
[00:42:12.504 --> 00:42:16.247]  And again, don't look to me because I live in my family's summer house.
[00:42:16.687 --> 00:42:23.451]  I'm not pretending to be, you know, what JD Vance actually is, which is a son of middle America, of working America.
[00:42:23.471 --> 00:42:23.791]  I'm not.
[00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:28.113]  But I try to observe and I try to talk to people.
[00:42:28.153 --> 00:42:28.754]  I like people.
[00:42:29.836 --> 00:42:36.922]  And I can tell you, I can promise you that the level of resentment toward those attitudes is extremely high.
[00:42:37.142 --> 00:42:38.183]  It's extremely high.
[00:42:38.383 --> 00:42:52.463]  And it absolutely should be.
[00:42:53.255 --> 00:42:53.716]  And share it.
[00:42:54.943 --> 00:42:57.704]  Tucker Carlson Warren's really dramatic, abrupt change is coming.
[00:42:58.285 --> 00:42:59.065]  We can all feel it.
[00:42:59.105 --> 00:42:59.746]  We can all see it.
[00:43:00.346 --> 00:43:01.226]  So I wrote some notes here.
[00:43:01.246 --> 00:43:12.072]  Yeah, Klaus Schwab and the globalists say they're going to collapse civilization and then social engineer you once you're totally poor through the social credit score and the universal basic income.
[00:43:13.133 --> 00:43:15.554]  So it's not that they're disconnected and don't care.
[00:43:15.714 --> 00:43:17.435]  No, they do care passionately.
[00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:18.916]  They want to kill you.
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:25.074]  It's like if somebody kidnapped your 10-year-old and raped and murdered him, you wouldn't just not care about them, you'd want to destroy them.
[00:43:25.815 --> 00:43:31.660]  Well, we've done nothing to the globalists, but they see us as eating their food, breathing their air, living on their planet.
[00:43:32.521 --> 00:43:42.229]  And it's a scientific plan, it's totally cold-blooded, and the only way to stop it is to understand that they're building an angrier world.
[00:43:43.149 --> 00:43:48.534]  They cut off the resources and then tell the brown people, that of the majority, it's the white people.
[00:43:50.737 --> 00:43:56.159]  And then the brown people watch the news and see a bunch of white people running things and go, I guess it is the white people.
[00:43:57.699 --> 00:44:03.441]  But it's the ultra-rich chi-coms and the Deimos group and the Rothschilds and all of them know exactly what they're doing.
[00:44:03.481 --> 00:44:05.562]  And I made this point a lot this week.
[00:44:07.762 --> 00:44:15.325]  They teach Jewish children, but you have an amazing history and you come from amazing people and you have an incredible culture and heritage.
[00:44:15.365 --> 00:44:18.246]  And I admire people that are proud of their heritage and culture.
[00:44:18.973 --> 00:44:25.657]  And then as an American, by our own corporate media, I'm told America's bad, George Washington's bad, let's take his statues down, and they are doing it.
[00:44:26.177 --> 00:44:29.940]  Versus Robert E. Lee, and I said it'll be George Washington next, and Thomas Jefferson, and it is.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:52.269]   And then it comes out all over the news that in public schools and private schools and camps and places you wouldn't know, they, almost all of the academics, I mean I'd say 70% now are leftist, they're getting grants to do it, so they're paid to do it, and they're in there Literally teaching children they're bad because they're white and teaching them because they're another color they're special and the white people are their enemy.
[00:44:52.853 --> 00:45:03.517]  But again, they're teaching all the children they're bad because they're human and hurting the earth, and they're teaching little boys they should be little girls, and little girls they should be little boys, making you every level of your life fundamentally hate yourself.
[00:45:03.557 --> 00:45:16.843]  And then, you better take this shot so you can't get sick, so you can protect other people, and they give them $40,000 at the pediatrician's offices for every 100 children under the age of 2 babies, they give the shot to.
[00:45:17.383 --> 00:45:18.483]  And $53,000 for everybody they intubate.
[00:45:20.814 --> 00:45:21.654]  With a respirator.
[00:45:21.795 --> 00:45:22.435]  With a ventilator.
[00:45:23.295 --> 00:45:25.737]  They knew it was an autoimmune response.
[00:45:25.777 --> 00:45:28.418]  They knew that a ventilator would kill you 90 plus percent of the time.
[00:45:28.799 --> 00:45:29.499]  And it did!
[00:45:29.899 --> 00:45:36.743]  It's all, testing can they kill us, testing can they cut our resources off, and hoping we won't notice.
[00:45:38.024 --> 00:45:52.479]   And so to the CIA and the Justice Department and the think tanks and the universities, Georgetown and Harvard and Yale that admittedly quarterback the lawsuits against us, With their legal staff, pro bono and all the rest of it.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.941]  That's on top of the 20 million they've spent in the last year trying to shut us down.
[00:45:56.301 --> 00:45:57.162]  That's in court documents.
[00:45:58.342 --> 00:45:59.703]  They're all going to be destroyed too.
[00:45:59.743 --> 00:46:00.683]  They're going to eat bugs.
[00:46:00.723 --> 00:46:02.044]  They're going to get chemtrailed.
[00:46:02.084 --> 00:46:03.525]  They're going to be 5G'd.
[00:46:04.865 --> 00:46:10.468]  But they're compartmentalized believing they're going to really build a utopia once they get rid of the old evil white men.
[00:46:10.488 --> 00:46:11.408]  So let's go to this clip.
[00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:16.691]  This is Leticia James, put in by George Soros, who also funds Hamas.
[00:46:16.751 --> 00:46:17.131]  Look it up.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:23.204]  Listen to what she says about white people, period, in any position of authority.
[00:46:23.224 --> 00:46:28.989]  And then remember, it's not her doing it, it's BlackRock saying, we don't hire any more white males, period.
[00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:37.257]  And 90% of the new hires in the last three and a half years in Europe and the US and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, same program, have not been white.
[00:46:38.479 --> 00:46:39.360]  Now, it sounds nice.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.103]  It's the power, though, to only hire a group according to their color.
[00:46:43.303 --> 00:46:47.186]  That's to control those groups and to make them be allied with this takeover.
[00:46:47.206 --> 00:46:48.787]  They'll get them, too, and they're getting them as well.
[00:46:49.788 --> 00:46:52.370]  But think about 91% was the number.
[00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.270]  I covered it two weeks ago.
[00:46:53.951 --> 00:47:01.231]   In the West, it's the same number everywhere, are not white because they're not hiring white people from dishwashers up
[00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:03.451]  to CEOs because, well, here's Leticia James.
[00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:15.451]   Stand up to an administration which is too male, too pale, and too stale.
[00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:22.951]  [cheering]
[00:47:23.377 --> 00:47:26.338]  Too male, too pale, and too stale!
[00:47:26.678 --> 00:47:29.699]  Too male, too pale, and too stale!
[00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:35.641]  And we will not go away silently!
[00:47:37.228 --> 00:47:38.549]  We will not be silent!
[00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:46.034]  And there she is with the ADL with her and the Muslims saying we don't like white people.
[00:47:46.194 --> 00:47:46.955]  They're the problem.
[00:47:47.595 --> 00:47:51.478]  Well, we know folks didn't like white people in Las Vegas where a retired police chief was riding his bike.
[00:47:51.498 --> 00:47:52.238]  We roll B-roll of that.
[00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:55.961]  You all know about that case and they ran him over because he's white and it killed his ass.
[00:47:56.481 --> 00:47:59.643]  Well, now they celebrated in court and told the family F you.
[00:48:01.584 --> 00:48:02.585]  They celebrated in court.
[00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:06.788]  We're going to come back and play the audio of that and then show the celebration in court.
[00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:11.914]  That's right, one more white devil out riding his bike, dead because of what color he is.
[00:48:12.614 --> 00:48:15.155]  That's about as Nazi as you get, but it's anti-white.
[00:48:15.816 --> 00:48:24.020]  And the ADL and BlackRock run it all, literally trying to say that your children, your baby, your month-old baby's bad because they're white.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Let me tell you something, we're not gonna howl Hitler and we're not gonna howl the ADL either.

[00:49:42.067 --> 00:49:47.545]   Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:49:48.065 --> 00:49:51.687]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:49:51.847 --> 00:49:54.189]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:49:54.229 --> 00:49:56.010]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.212]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:50:00.013 --> 00:50:04.235]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:07.638]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:11.640]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold floor.
[00:50:14.342 --> 00:50:19.684]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:50:19.744 --> 00:50:21.845]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.446]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:50:23.506 --> 00:50:26.567]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:50:26.687 --> 00:50:28.148]  You silenced those voices.
[00:50:28.188 --> 00:50:31.909]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:50:31.749 --> 00:50:38.749]   Soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:50:38.749 --> 00:50:42.749]  [Applause]
[00:50:43.749 --> 00:50:48.749]  [Music]
[00:50:48.749 --> 00:50:55.749]   For many years, doctors have received bonuses for adherence to the latest drug therapy protocol.
[00:50:56.683 --> 00:51:01.428]  Drugs that are known to be dangerous, such as statins and antidepressants.
[00:51:01.969 --> 00:51:07.234]  And now we know that insurance companies are paying doctors to fully vaccinate your children.
[00:51:07.955 --> 00:51:24.519]  This incentive program for vaccinating babies can be found in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Doctor Incentives Booklet and specifies that every patient under the age of two that receives the currently prescribed 24 inoculations is worth a $400 payout to that doctor.
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:35.041]  For further motivation, they get paid by the hundred and they have to vaccinate a certain percentage of their total patients or they don't get anything.
[00:51:35.762 --> 00:51:42.883]  Blue Cross Blue Shield say that a doctor needs to vaccinate 63% of their patients in order to qualify.
[00:51:43.583 --> 00:51:54.585]  The average American pediatrician has about 1,500 patients and would have to have at least 945 of them fully vaccinated in order to get paid anything.
[00:51:55.265 --> 00:52:00.808]  At $40,000 for every 100, this works out to $360,000.
[00:52:01.388 --> 00:52:09.572]  This is why most pediatricians won't provide care for families who don't completely submit to the latest childhood vaccine protocol.
[00:52:10.152 --> 00:52:16.055]  We are talking over a quarter million dollars, which is more than the average pediatrician's yearly salary.
[00:52:16.835 --> 00:52:26.577]  Research shows that an unvaccinated child's risk of death increases by over 5,000 percent when they receive the current vaccine schedule.
[00:52:27.118 --> 00:52:35.200]  And doctors are now beginning to use virtual reality to help them administer these poisons to children who instinctively know better.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.462]  I don't want to!
[00:52:41.403 --> 00:52:43.284]  I don't want to!
[00:52:43.424 --> 00:52:44.485]  I'm scared!

[00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:35.113]  First, the ice pollen.
[00:53:35.214 --> 00:53:36.014]  It's very quick.
[00:53:36.034 --> 00:53:36.415]  Come here.
[00:53:36.435 --> 00:53:37.295]  Wait a minute.
[00:53:37.435 --> 00:53:38.156]  Ready.

[00:53:41.679 --> 00:53:42.460]  But, look, let's go.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:42.900]  Very quickly.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.041]  Wait a minute.
[00:53:44.061 --> 00:53:45.402]  Let me get it here.
[00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:47.123]  Go, little shield!
[00:53:47.163 --> 00:53:50.266]  Go, little shield!
[00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:53.226]  Go, little shield, go, little shield!
[00:53:53.226 --> 00:53:55.226]  It works, it works, it works!
[00:53:55.226 --> 00:53:59.226]  Thank you, thank you!
[00:53:59.226 --> 00:54:00.065]  Oh my God!
[00:54:00.065 --> 00:54:02.065]  [Music]
[00:54:01.414 --> 00:54:01.935]  Thank you!
[00:54:02.075 --> 00:54:02.695]  Oh no, my son!
[00:54:03.216 --> 00:54:05.277]  What did you think of that?
[00:54:05.418 --> 00:54:05.598]  Cool!
[00:54:07.135 --> 00:54:12.815]   It's the first time in 15 years of my professional activity with vaccines
[00:54:12.815 --> 00:54:17.815]  that virtual reality can transfer pain and entertainment.
[00:54:17.815 --> 00:54:21.815]  He cried in all he took since he was born.
[00:54:21.815 --> 00:54:23.815]  And this time, no.
[00:54:23.815 --> 00:54:26.815]   I even thought he was going to give a little show here today.
[00:54:26.815 --> 00:54:29.815]   When I was little, I had the same, but now I don't have it anymore.
[00:54:29.815 --> 00:54:35.815]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:54:36.494 --> 00:54:42.494]  [Music]
[00:54:42.494 --> 00:54:46.494]   Alright, so I've got a correction to make here as we start the second hour
[00:54:46.494 --> 00:54:49.494]   ahead of Vivek Ramaswamy joining us here in about 15 minutes.
[00:54:49.494 --> 00:54:59.494]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:54:50.645 --> 00:55:08.653]  I was going from memory because I've seen the numbers in Australia, the UK, Europe, Canada, and it's around 91% of the new hires since BlackRock that controls the planet launched its new rules three years ago that only brown people or black people would be hired from dishwashers up to CEOs.
[00:55:12.848 --> 00:55:16.831]  And then the crew's like, no actually we pulled it up from Bloomberg going after the national statistics here in the U.S.
[00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:17.812]  I'm sorry, I was wrong.
[00:55:18.473 --> 00:55:22.075]  And we'll put it on screen.
[00:55:22.095 --> 00:55:26.098]  94% of new hires in the entire market in the U.S., the average is 91 in the West.
[00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:27.580]  So I was right about that.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:33.604]  In the U.S., 94% of all hires at all levels was non-white.
[00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:40.650]  And it was directly because they were told by BlackRock, you will not get a good ESG UN score if you hire white people.
[00:55:42.011 --> 00:55:42.772]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:55:43.412 --> 00:55:46.135]  And then the airlines have said, we're not hiring new white pilots.
[00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:52.601]  So imagine the level of that discrimination.
[00:55:52.701 --> 00:55:55.644]  I mean, even if you're for this, who died and made Blackrock King?
[00:55:55.684 --> 00:55:57.625]  And do you think Larry Fink of Blackrock?
[00:55:58.456 --> 00:56:04.340]  With all the evil stuff he's funding, the Eat the Bugs, Open Borders, it's all that combine.
[00:56:05.141 --> 00:56:18.311]  They're doing this to set the precedent for ESGs and the social credit score, where if you'll accept, hey, we're only going to hire brown people, well, you'll accept, hey, we're going to fire you because you're a Christian, or you went out and protested Open Borders.
[00:56:18.951 --> 00:56:20.392]  It's about punishing you.
[00:56:20.432 --> 00:56:27.578]  It's the next level of not just surveilling you and censoring you online, but censoring you in the real world and the social credit score.
[00:56:29.065 --> 00:56:36.492]  Central Bank Digital Currencies that are programmed to tell you where you can spend it and with who.
[00:56:37.998 --> 00:56:45.602]  And then once the President said, oh, it's to help the brown people, they just cut off the food in the third world for almost three years.
[00:56:46.042 --> 00:56:49.563]  We only had lockdowns for a year here in the West, some places a year and a half like Australia.
[00:56:50.064 --> 00:56:59.368]  Three years, starving 80 plus million people to death, then organizing the survivors as refugees to come here to fully weigh us down and collapse us.
[00:56:59.408 --> 00:57:01.049]  No, they want to kill those people too.
[00:57:01.969 --> 00:57:09.935]  But they dangle free student loans and forgivance of loans and reparations to control people and get them on board.
[00:57:09.955 --> 00:57:11.456]  So this is from Bloomberg.
[00:57:12.417 --> 00:57:13.238]  Bloomberg Business.
[00:57:13.898 --> 00:57:14.719]  Bloomberg.com.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:16.640]  Look at this.
[00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:26.327]  And it's how proud they are at Bloomberg and BlackRock that in the United States only 6% of new hires for the last few years were white people.
[00:57:26.347 --> 00:57:26.988]  94% non-white.
[00:57:28.772 --> 00:57:32.934]  Now, if that isn't discrimination, I don't know what is.
[00:57:36.316 --> 00:57:40.318]  And they think people are so stupid they can only see this in the first order of magnitude.
[00:57:40.638 --> 00:57:42.720]  What about the second order, third order, fourth order?
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.761]  And in the future, you say, well, I'll just be a farmer and live out here on my own.
[00:57:45.801 --> 00:57:48.182]  Well, they're just not going to let you even operate or buy fertilizer.
[00:57:49.263 --> 00:57:50.704]  Because again, you're not a black-owned business.
[00:57:53.444 --> 00:57:57.688]  This is cold-blooded, it's absolute discrimination, but it's what you would expect from the system.
[00:57:58.089 --> 00:58:07.998]  So here's Leticia James, when she was running for Attorney General, talking about anybody in government that's white is the enemy and we can't have that.
[00:58:08.379 --> 00:58:15.826]  And there she is with the ADL and the Islamist up there on the stand, up there on the stage, doing all this.
[00:58:15.866 --> 00:58:16.207]  Here it is.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:24.260]   I stand up to an administration which is too male, too pale, and too stale.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:32.260]  [Cheering]
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.260]  Too male, too pale, and too stale.
[00:58:35.604 --> 00:58:38.625]  Too male, too pale, and too stale!
[00:58:38.645 --> 00:58:44.566]  And we will not go away silently!
[00:58:46.149 --> 00:58:47.470]  We will not be silent!
[00:58:49.171 --> 00:58:55.594]  Oh, we know you won't be silent, because you work for BlackRock, because they want a black face, like Obama, on cutting off the resources of the third world.
[00:58:55.634 --> 00:59:02.878]  If you're about to kill and starve to death billions of people and then use the survivors to overwhelm the West, well, you've got to have a black face on it.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:15.988]   Meanwhile, it's trickled down to, I guess, a Hispanic and a black man, young men, Everybody knows about this case, but now we've had a response to it.
[00:59:16.328 --> 00:59:24.375]  Let's go ahead and roll the video, a few months ago, where they see the old white man and laugh, so they run him over and kill him on his bicycle because it's so much fun.
[00:59:25.456 --> 00:59:30.580]  And then now they're back in court yesterday, flipping off the family and celebrating and having a great time.
[00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:32.622]  Go ahead and just play both clips back to back.
[00:59:33.182 --> 00:59:33.643]  Alright, go.
[00:59:34.744 --> 00:59:44.744]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:59:44.744 --> 00:59:53.888]   *sounds of a car crashing* Premeditated murder!
[00:59:53.748 --> 01:00:03.748]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:00:03.748 --> 01:00:11.987]  Yeah, premeditated murder.
[01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:14.467]  Kill that white devil.
[01:00:14.467 --> 01:00:15.827]  Knock that.
[01:00:15.905 --> 01:00:17.667]  Get out of here.
[01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:33.841]  Apart from each other in District Court Tuesday to set a trial date, 18-year-old Jesus Ayala and 16-year-old Jameer Keyes were seen giggling, conversing, covering their faces from media, and flipping off the Probst family.
[01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:39.065]  How can you sit there after taking a man's life and act like such an entitled...
[01:00:40.126 --> 01:00:44.829]  It's a scene that made the family of retired police chief Andreas Probst livid.
[01:00:45.189 --> 01:00:47.910]  His daughter Taylor shocked by the callous conduct.
[01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.952]  They really have no remorse that this is just a game to them.
[01:00:51.072 --> 01:00:58.136]  Metro police say Ayala was the driver and Keyes the passenger in an intentional hit and run that killed Probst on August 14th.
[01:00:59.376 --> 01:01:05.980]  Probst was cycling in a bike lane north on Taneo Way near Centennial Parkway in the Northwest Valley when he was mowed down.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.161]  It's not that serious.
[01:01:07.561 --> 01:01:15.646]  Video from Grand Jury Evidence released Monday shows Ayala joking around with an officer in the back of a police car following his arrest.
[01:01:15.866 --> 01:01:21.910]  On the news last night, I once again saw a brand new piece of video that I've never seen before.
[01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:29.196]  Ayala's public defender, David Westbrook, argued in court he saw the body cam footage on our channel for the first time.
[01:01:29.216 --> 01:01:35.841]  I don't know if I need a press pass to get discovery, but I would certainly like to get some discovery in this case before the media gets it.
[01:01:36.161 --> 01:01:41.746]  However, the evidence was not obtained through prosecutors, but through a public records request.
[01:01:41.926 --> 01:01:45.389]  I understand that it's a grand jury, so that makes sense.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:50.804]  Judge Jacqueline Bluth acknowledged media is allowed access to grand jury exhibits.
[01:01:51.224 --> 01:01:57.209]  Still, Westbrook told the judge he's concerned about finding fair jurors in the case because of the media attention.
[01:01:57.229 --> 01:01:58.230]  Back it up to that judge.
[01:01:58.570 --> 01:01:59.150]  You can tell.
[01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:08.738]  And I've seen reports like 40% of Congress is on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and something like 30% are on Adderall.
[01:02:10.219 --> 01:02:11.480]  Look at that judge's eyes.
[01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:15.744]  I mean, these people are all whacked out of their gourds.
[01:02:19.249 --> 01:02:20.570]  Oh, but don't worry, she has a pink gavel.
[01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:23.693]  I mean, look at these people.
[01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:25.654]  Our country's poisoned.
[01:02:26.355 --> 01:02:28.176]  We're the most drugged-up country in the world.
[01:02:29.337 --> 01:02:36.323]  And these young punks are so stupid, they don't know they can get the death penalty, and they're laughing and giggling and think it's funny.
[01:02:36.623 --> 01:02:39.586]  They're called psychotics, not just sociopaths.
[01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:46.912]  And again, we've got competent women and competent people of brown skin to be judges.
[01:02:47.804 --> 01:02:52.682]   are pilots. But what they're doing is they're going out and getting political operatives that
[01:02:52.682 --> 01:02:57.884]   will do anything. Look how much the public defender loves this guy. It's so funny and
[01:02:57.884 --> 01:03:04.443]   tries to blame the prosecutors who didn't go out and get the video, didn't go check and know that
[01:03:04.443 --> 01:03:09.084]   was squad car video because the case just started. And he acts like, oh, you're holding back evidence
[01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:23.563]   for me that my client was celebrating in a police car that they just killed a white devil.
[01:03:23.768 --> 01:03:43.499]   Because they believe they've been given car blanche, green light, to go out and carry out Open season on people.
[01:03:46.063 --> 01:03:47.745]  If they're white.
[01:03:47.765 --> 01:03:49.868]  You mean to play about an hour of knockout game footage?
[01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.650]  I can.
[01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:56.316]  People dying, people getting pushed in front of trains, and the media covers it up.
[01:03:56.937 --> 01:03:57.858]  In this case, it came out.
[01:03:59.059 --> 01:04:03.242]  Alright, Vivek Ramaswamy is set to join us to cover the waterfront and so much more today.
[01:04:03.262 --> 01:04:07.165]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and man of many other coordinates of liberty.
[01:04:07.185 --> 01:04:10.468]  This is all funded by George Soros and the CIA.
[01:04:10.688 --> 01:04:11.648]  Every bit of this.
[01:04:11.709 --> 01:04:13.090]  Leticia James, all of it.
[01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:28.003]   Well, joining us is the number two candidate, hands down, In the Republican field, and the only real person out there in the Republican field that I think that would make as good a president as President Trump, and that's Vivek Ramaswamy.
[01:04:28.023 --> 01:04:29.765]  So he doesn't need really any introduction.
[01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.666]  Vivek Ramaswamy on Twitter, Vivek2024.com.
[01:04:31.706 --> 01:04:32.627]  We've got until about...
[01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:36.411]  45, 50, after or so.
[01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:38.273]  Vivek, great being on your show.
[01:04:38.353 --> 01:04:39.254]  Wow, huge reach.
[01:04:39.314 --> 01:04:40.155]  It's really gone viral.
[01:04:40.175 --> 01:04:41.536]  People really appreciate that.
[01:04:41.896 --> 01:04:44.239]  Thanks for letting me have an uncensored voice.
[01:04:44.879 --> 01:04:50.385]  But let's talk about the world today and why you're so popular because you're one of the only informed candidates.
[01:04:50.885 --> 01:04:57.766]  That actually has solutions and that resonates with the populist awakening.
[01:04:57.786 --> 01:04:59.387]  I know you don't like terms or labels.
[01:04:59.887 --> 01:05:02.267]  I don't either, but people still need labels.
[01:05:02.547 --> 01:05:03.748]  How would you describe yourself?
[01:05:03.788 --> 01:05:06.308]  And then let's cover whatever subject you want to hit first.
[01:05:06.348 --> 01:05:07.809]  I've got a big list of questions here.
[01:05:08.189 --> 01:05:16.190]  Super PAC cancer on American politics, avoiding World War III, Ukraine war corruption, Nikki Haley corruption, shutting down Deep State, and how to actually do it.
[01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:18.551]  Vivek Ramaswamy, thanks for the time.
[01:05:19.972 --> 01:05:21.193]  It's good to talk to you again, Alex.
[01:05:21.253 --> 01:05:30.059]  And I would describe myself, you're right, I'm not a big, I don't think these labels are particularly useful because once you use it, it then gets diluted and means something else.
[01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:33.001]  But if I had to pick, I'm an American nationalist.
[01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:37.184]  I don't think that the nationalist label has to be a negative word.
[01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:51.410]   I think America is founded On bold revolutionary ideals that date back to 1776, that unite people across their differences in this country, across our genetics, were brought together by a common set of ideals.
[01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:59.053]  And my belief is that I am a citizen of this nation, not some nebulous, vague, global citizen fighting climate change somewhere.
[01:05:59.113 --> 01:06:11.510]   No, I'm a citizen of this nation, the United States of America, and that as your next president, that's what I'm running for, my moral obligation is to the citizens of this country, period.
[01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.069]  Not to anybody else.
[01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.989]   And I think that's a clear vision of how the US president should operate.
[01:06:16.989 --> 01:06:21.850]   That's part of the reason I'm running for US president is I think we have lost that sense in our country.
[01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.630]  We ought to revive it, but that's the label I would use.
[01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:30.230]   And I'm using the Republican Party as a vehicle to advance a pro-American agenda.
[01:06:30.385 --> 01:06:34.330]  I'm not a partisan hack, but I do think that I care about this country.
[01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:39.736]  I'm an unapologetic nationalist and will not apologize for the ideals this nation was founded on.
[01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:44.381]  And yes, we have a two-party system, and I'm using the better of the two to advance my agenda.
[01:06:47.079 --> 01:06:51.062]  Well, you've got the floor here because they fight really to censor you.
[01:06:51.082 --> 01:06:56.687]  When you surged to number two and were climbing, the entire corporate system turned against you.
[01:06:56.727 --> 01:07:02.891]  Some of the Republicans turned against you because, as you said, they're just reading off the script given to them by their donors.
[01:07:03.212 --> 01:07:07.435]  It's so refreshing because everything you say is not from the donor class.
[01:07:07.735 --> 01:07:09.597]  It's from true Americana.
[01:07:11.095 --> 01:07:14.717]  There's something interesting I've learned, maybe to lift the curtain on this a little bit, Alex.
[01:07:15.037 --> 01:07:17.338]  My first book was a book called Woke Inc.
[01:07:17.358 --> 01:07:21.419]  I wrote it in the aftermath of the George Floyd death and the BLM protests.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.201]  This was back when I was a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company I'd built from scratch.
[01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:27.442]  Comfortable job.
[01:07:28.082 --> 01:07:32.444]  There's backlash because I don't back BLM or because I refuse to make a corporate statement.
[01:07:33.064 --> 01:07:40.707]  I had to step down from my job as a CEO, and then I wrote this book, Woke Inc., to lay out the infiltration of corporate America.
[01:07:41.387 --> 01:07:42.047]  And I laid that out.
[01:07:42.087 --> 01:07:43.428]  So I was talking about woke culture.
[01:07:43.888 --> 01:07:49.910]  I've been probably at the leading edge of talking about the transgenderism epidemic in the country, climatism as a cult.
[01:07:50.451 --> 01:07:56.453]  And what's interesting to me is, in the Republican Party, those messages all land pretty well, actually.
[01:07:56.693 --> 01:08:08.400]  They're controversial in some circles with the left, but I've been embraced by many on the right over the last several years through the multiple books that I've written about wokeness, about victimhood culture and everything else.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.902]  And at that time, Alex, I thought I was hitting the third rail, right?
[01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:22.108]  This was the topics that in the worlds that I was in, in corporate America and in, you know, elite America that I, you know, wasn't born into it, but have lived it for a time.
[01:08:22.648 --> 01:08:25.853]  It felt like I was speaking the things that you're not supposed to speak.
[01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:27.315]  And in a certain sense, I was.
[01:08:28.156 --> 01:08:35.186]  But what I've really realized in this journey is that it's like your eyes are open, actually.
[01:08:36.027 --> 01:08:38.430]  It turns out I wasn't really hitting the third rail.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:49.222]  Every Republican candidate running for president is perfectly comfortable saying that, you know, women shouldn't be competing with men in swimming competitions or forced to compete with men in swimming competitions.
[01:08:49.322 --> 01:08:50.183]  And I believe that too.
[01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:51.983]  But it turns out we all agree on that.
[01:08:52.003 --> 01:08:59.885]  And then what we end up having is this pissing contest of who's more anti-woke, exhibiting more outrage about such a thing.
[01:09:00.545 --> 01:09:02.326]  The real third rail, I'll tell you what it is.
[01:09:03.331 --> 01:09:05.052]  It's foreign policy, right?
[01:09:05.072 --> 01:09:20.583]  And so I come out here, I reject the neocon vision of the last 25 years, the vision of liberal hegemony, that it's the job of the United States to fight somebody else's war halfway around the world, when we should be protecting our own citizens here at home.
[01:09:20.983 --> 01:09:23.525]  I'm a George Washington, America First conservative.
[01:09:23.805 --> 01:09:25.886]  That's a positive American nationalist vision.
[01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:38.851]  And what I realized actually was that while I thought I was hitting, well I thought I was actually taking great personal risk and hitting the third rail on the woke issues and otherwise and you know I did take serious personal risks based on the world that I was in.
[01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:44.793]  Much of the conservative or at least Republican traditional mainstream Republican ecosystem embraced me for that.
[01:09:45.153 --> 01:10:00.622]   But it's really when I started talking about America First principles in foreign policy And these are my views, to believe that my sole obligation is to advance the interests of citizens here in the homeland, to protect American lives, not to protect some other separate interest.
[01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:05.384]  That's really when I realized that, no, no, no, it wasn't the woke stuff.
[01:10:05.444 --> 01:10:06.965]  That was easy by comparison.
[01:10:07.486 --> 01:10:11.348]  These are the issues that really hit the nerve of the mainstream in both parties.
[01:10:11.428 --> 01:10:12.349]  You hit right at the core.
[01:10:12.389 --> 01:10:17.632]  So you've committed the crime Donald Trump committed in that he medded about America first.
[01:10:18.132 --> 01:10:26.544]  And about peace, and look at the peace we got for four years, and look, it's like a switch got thrown with O'Biden, and now we're living on the edge of World War III.
[01:10:27.697 --> 01:10:31.998]  We are marching our way into World War III by the day, and I'm genuinely worried.
[01:10:32.018 --> 01:10:38.260]  I mean, some of these people, corrupt politicians in both parties, stand to make money as we march our way into war.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.261]  I mean, Biden's version of this is simple.
[01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:51.345]  His son was paid $5 million by Burisma to sit on their board, a guy who has no qualifications to work at a local gas station or a fast food chain, let alone to sit on the board of an energy company abroad.
[01:10:51.845 --> 01:10:58.949]   And yet this is a guy who has made $5 million Or more, for all we know, but at least $5 million from doing it.
[01:10:59.249 --> 01:11:06.215]  Do you think it's an accident that they're now sending hundreds of billions of dollars of our taxpayer money to fund a war with that same country?
[01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:10.418]  Now, people will say, are you some sort of sympathizer with Russia or Putin?
[01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:10.999]  Forget that.
[01:11:11.479 --> 01:11:13.100]  I wouldn't trust Vladimir Putin.
[01:11:13.281 --> 01:11:15.803]  Vladimir Putin is no... He's a craven dictator.
[01:11:15.823 --> 01:11:16.723]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:11:17.124 --> 01:11:20.446]  But just because Putin is bad does not mean that Ukraine is good.
[01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:28.912]  And I think that that's the trap that they've lulled the American people into accepting, forgetting the fact that Ukraine is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.
[01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:33.454]  It has consolidated all of its media into one state TV media arm.
[01:11:33.935 --> 01:11:34.475]  You know, interesting.
[01:11:34.495 --> 01:11:35.576]  There's a discussion to have in America.
[01:11:35.596 --> 01:11:44.341]  And now they're openly saying outright ban the Orthodox Church that predates even Russian culture, the oldest institution in Ukraine.
[01:11:45.188 --> 01:11:54.356]  It's anti-Christian, fundamentally, and so the irony is, you think about Christian engagement in other parts of the world, look at Ukraine, that's hostile to Christians in its own country.
[01:11:54.857 --> 01:11:58.620]  By the way, it says it won't hold its elections this year unless the US forks over more money.
[01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:04.446]  And the regions that are occupied in eastern Ukraine, they are Russian-speaking regions, right?
[01:12:04.806 --> 01:12:14.675]   These are regions that The majority of people who live there don't even view themselves as part of Ukraine, and also regions that haven't been represented in the Ukrainian parliament for the better part of a decade.
[01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:15.176]  Well, that's right.
[01:12:15.216 --> 01:12:16.337]  Vivek, we've got to go to break.
[01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:17.097]  Stay right there.
[01:12:17.117 --> 01:12:18.018]  Really honored to have you.
[01:12:18.038 --> 01:12:18.419]  Amazing.
[01:12:18.439 --> 01:12:24.885]  And I want to get more into how do we stop World War III, but I want to also just get into Israel and Hamas and then...
[01:12:26.853 --> 01:12:32.275]  Uh, just this mass shooting in Maine and just, it seems like, it doesn't seem like it's happening.
[01:12:32.796 --> 01:12:33.716]  Things are burning down.
[01:12:33.956 --> 01:12:35.137]  The inflation, all of it.
[01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.218]  Vivek Ramaswamy is our guest.
[01:12:38.238 --> 01:12:38.698]  All right.
[01:12:39.018 --> 01:12:42.120]  He is the number two guy right behind Trump, hands down.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:49.683]  And if they put Trump in prison or kill him, I mean, it'll be Vivek, probably the nominee, or maybe he'll surpass Trump.
[01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:52.564]  So obviously I went back and researched him.
[01:12:52.905 --> 01:12:53.485]  I've seen him.
[01:12:54.445 --> 01:12:57.646]  In the last few years really to a crash course in awakening as he just said.
[01:12:57.666 --> 01:13:02.387]  I mean, I think he's a great guy and that's why the establishment's been attacking him.
[01:13:02.407 --> 01:13:05.768]  But you were finishing up on how to avoid nuclear World War III.
[01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:11.270]  Then I know you're front and center about these super PACs and how they control the parties and your fight against them.
[01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:11.850]  Please continue.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.762]  Yeah, so on Russia-Ukraine, it's pretty simple.
[01:13:16.322 --> 01:13:19.184]  Do a simple peace deal that's reasonable, okay?
[01:13:19.204 --> 01:13:26.068]  That says the Russian-speaking regions that are already occupied, we're not going to fight a war with a major nuclear power in the form of Russia over that region.
[01:13:26.588 --> 01:13:27.469]  They get that deal.
[01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:31.711]  They also get a hard commitment that NATO doesn't admit Ukraine to NATO.
[01:13:31.751 --> 01:13:32.972]  NATO's been a disaster.
[01:13:33.312 --> 01:13:34.353]  We should have said that up front.
[01:13:34.373 --> 01:13:36.494]  We probably could have avoided this war, but say it now.
[01:13:37.015 --> 01:13:41.898]  But in return, we require that Putin exit his military alliance with China.
[01:13:42.478 --> 01:13:44.940]  The Russia-China military alliance, that's what worries me.
[01:13:45.401 --> 01:13:53.728]  And we are pushing Russia further into China's arms because of these disastrous policies we've adopted with NATO and arming Ukraine to the teeth.
[01:13:54.188 --> 01:13:55.069]  And that's a disaster.
[01:13:55.089 --> 01:13:58.792]  $200 billion of our own money and resources going to fund this war.
[01:13:59.072 --> 01:13:59.493]  It's wrong.
[01:14:00.033 --> 01:14:02.414]  So, my foreign policy, Alex, is pretty simple.
[01:14:02.974 --> 01:14:09.077]  Avoid World War III, declare independence from China, period, and then secure this homeland.
[01:14:09.557 --> 01:14:12.999]  Cyber defenses, border defenses, missile defenses.
[01:14:13.479 --> 01:14:15.200]  In fact, people don't pay attention to this one.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:23.064]  Super EMP defenses, electromagnetic pulse attacks that we could be vulnerable to, that take out our electric grid in a matter of days.
[01:14:23.504 --> 01:14:24.525]  Nobody's talked about that.
[01:14:24.565 --> 01:14:26.326]  We're as vulnerable as we've ever been.
[01:14:26.346 --> 01:14:29.508]  In fact, that's our Achilles heel, according to all the experts.
[01:14:29.528 --> 01:14:31.469]  We're talking a $2 billion, $3 billion fix.
[01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:32.409]  There's no backups.
[01:14:32.729 --> 01:14:33.730]  There's no shielding.
[01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.191]  An enemy could do it, or a solar flare could do it.
[01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:41.094]  And the estimates are 90% die within one year if the power grid was knocked out.
[01:14:41.114 --> 01:14:42.495]  I mean, this is the Achilles heel.
[01:14:43.482 --> 01:14:45.323]  And nobody's talking about neither party.
[01:14:45.603 --> 01:14:52.068]  Well, we're forking over hundreds of billions of dollars to somebody else's war halfway around the world that makes Joe Biden rich.
[01:14:52.108 --> 01:14:53.789]  And you got politicians in the Republican Party.
[01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:56.010]  They get rich off these foreign wars, too.
[01:14:56.551 --> 01:15:02.715]  And part of what I see in this race is you got George Bush and Dick Cheney took us into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:15:03.135 --> 01:15:05.316]  Six and a half trillion dollars spent.
[01:15:05.737 --> 01:15:07.658]  Thousands of American lives sacrificed.
[01:15:08.018 --> 01:15:11.182]  I'm going to put an end to that nonsense, but we got Dick Cheney 2.0.
[01:15:11.522 --> 01:15:16.768]  That's basically the Republican primary, minus me and Trump in this race, who are the only two America First candidates.
[01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:21.674]  Now, you know, I'm of the next generation, and I think that's what it's going to take to lead us forward.
[01:15:21.714 --> 01:15:24.377]  I've got fresh legs, but we've got to talk about that's a separate point.
[01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:28.920]  It's Dick Cheney 2.0 in the modern Republican Party that they're trying to bring back.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.221]  And that doesn't advance the American interest.
[01:15:31.581 --> 01:15:37.363]  And they're marching us into World War III while a bunch of people get to buy bigger houses in the Republican Party along with it.
[01:15:37.844 --> 01:15:40.565]  And it's shameful corruption that's actually tainted our system.
[01:15:41.311 --> 01:15:49.656]  And that leads us right into the super PACs and how all the other candidates, other than you and Trump, just regurgitate the talking points.
[01:15:49.956 --> 01:15:52.017]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:15:52.037 --> 01:15:55.339]  And what good is their money if we're in a nuclear hellscape?
[01:15:56.399 --> 01:15:59.821]  So you've really seen this from the inside and been attacked by it.
[01:16:00.402 --> 01:16:02.323]  What's your critique of the PACs?
[01:16:03.317 --> 01:16:04.499]  So here's my critique.
[01:16:04.579 --> 01:16:09.785]  We have a system that says $3,300 is the maximum you can give in a primary and in a general.
[01:16:09.825 --> 01:16:11.827]  So $6,600 is the max you can give.
[01:16:12.188 --> 01:16:15.351]  That's a lot of money, but you're not going to buy a paying candidate for U.S.
[01:16:15.391 --> 01:16:16.393]  President with that sum.
[01:16:16.713 --> 01:16:17.434]  And that's a good thing.
[01:16:18.175 --> 01:16:19.616]  But it turns out, Alex, that's a lie.
[01:16:19.797 --> 01:16:20.437]  It is a farce.
[01:16:21.138 --> 01:16:26.842]  Almost all of the money that's being spent during this campaign season is being spent by the super PACs.
[01:16:26.902 --> 01:16:30.704]  We have people writing multi-million dollar checks, sometimes tens.
[01:16:31.064 --> 01:16:35.687]  Soon it'll be hundreds of millions of dollars that one individual can give to one of these candidates.
[01:16:36.207 --> 01:16:38.669]  And so that turns these candidates into their puppets.
[01:16:39.209 --> 01:16:40.229]  It's like a law of nature.
[01:16:40.269 --> 01:16:49.513]  It's like as the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, every one of these Republican politicians, Democrats too, dance to the tune of their biggest donor.
[01:16:50.213 --> 01:16:52.174]  Now, in my case, that biggest donor is me.
[01:16:52.314 --> 01:16:58.857]  And I'm going to keep it that way because that's part of how we declare independence from this corrupt system.
[01:16:59.477 --> 01:17:02.259]  Then you've got other candidates like Nikki Haley, for example.
[01:17:02.279 --> 01:17:05.842]  I mean, she has made a career out of making money off of her time in government.
[01:17:06.282 --> 01:17:12.126]  Joins the board of Boeing after years of doing special favors for Boeing as South Carolina's governor.
[01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:20.052]  Short stint at the UN, exploit government connections to start a family military contracting business with undisclosed clients.
[01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:25.376]  So these people will send your kids to war and they will laugh making money as they do it so they can buy a bigger house.
[01:17:25.836 --> 01:17:26.597]  That's corrupt.
[01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:27.618]  It's wrong.
[01:17:27.678 --> 01:17:30.361]  And then somebody's form she brags about her foreign policy experience.
[01:17:30.802 --> 01:17:32.223]  It shows in her bank account.
[01:17:32.544 --> 01:17:33.264]  But it exists.
[01:17:33.304 --> 01:17:37.529]  My point in Joe Biden and the Biden crime family, it exists in the Republican Party, too.
[01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:40.233]  And that's why I don't care about partisan politics.
[01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:42.876]  It's corruption on both sides of the aisle.
[01:17:42.936 --> 01:17:45.379]  So I would put an end to super PACs.
[01:17:45.899 --> 01:17:51.901]  I would say that if you have worked in the government, you can't lobby the government for at least 10 years until you've left that government.
[01:17:52.321 --> 01:17:55.242]  You shouldn't be able to sit on the board of a company that you regulated.
[01:17:55.562 --> 01:17:58.423]  Think about the last head of the FDA now sitting on the board of Pfizer.
[01:17:58.563 --> 01:17:59.124]  Pathetic.
[01:17:59.684 --> 01:18:01.124]  So these are basic rules of the road.
[01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:06.126]  If you're working in Congress or working at a regulator, you shouldn't be able to trade individual stocks.
[01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:11.771]  Well sure, I mean we don't let foreign governments, at least they do now but it's illegal, buy our politicians.
[01:18:11.791 --> 01:18:17.256]  Well a corporation that's multinational is just as dangerous as a foreign government, especially when it's BlackRock, so I'll out with China.
[01:18:17.897 --> 01:18:19.318]  But I want to talk about big picture here.
[01:18:19.718 --> 01:18:30.869]  You surged from nowhere to the number two position in a field of what, ten people or whatever it is, or maybe bigger, because people are ready for something new and they can tell you're smart.
[01:18:31.449 --> 01:18:36.613]  And you are saying the things that they believe and they stand for, and they are the constituents, they are the voters.
[01:18:36.653 --> 01:18:39.615]  But look at Javier Mele.
[01:18:40.076 --> 01:18:41.177]  Look at all these others.
[01:18:41.977 --> 01:18:43.258]  Look at Bolsonaro.
[01:18:44.179 --> 01:18:45.400]  They're set to win elections.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.821]  He's in a runoff right now.
[01:18:47.141 --> 01:18:51.424]  They indict him for saying the Socialists and Communists have devalued the currency.
[01:18:51.845 --> 01:18:52.445]  Well, they have.
[01:18:52.505 --> 01:18:53.746]  He's not the one that devalued it.
[01:18:54.166 --> 01:19:11.037]   So that's why a lot of other Republicans aren't willing to have courage like you or Trump, is because I have no doubt that if Trump dies of a heart attack tomorrow, God forbid, or has a stroke, or his plane blows up and they assassinate him, that you will catapult into the number one position, and that they will then indict you.
[01:19:11.298 --> 01:19:12.678]  I mean, Vivek, you're a smart guy.
[01:19:12.698 --> 01:19:13.799]  Everybody knows that.
[01:19:14.079 --> 01:19:19.723]  I mean, you've had to have thought about the reason the Republicans sit there and go, but this establishment is, they're cowards.
[01:19:21.055 --> 01:19:25.676]  You know, they are a bunch of cowards and they're bought and paid for, which is really the travesty in this.
[01:19:25.716 --> 01:19:27.857]  And some of the things you said, I don't want those bad things to happen.
[01:19:27.897 --> 01:19:34.158]  I mean, I want to convince the people of this country through the front door, but I respect the heck out of Trump and his national service to this country.
[01:19:34.578 --> 01:19:37.659]  And I will respect his legacy more than anybody else will.
[01:19:38.119 --> 01:19:46.741]  It irritates the heck out of me to see the other candidates who have licked his feet for special favors that they tried to get from him, now criticizing him and Monday morning quarterbacking him.
[01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:49.382]  That's wrong because they're allergic to the America First movement.
[01:19:49.442 --> 01:19:49.902]  That's why.
[01:19:50.422 --> 01:19:54.164]  These people want to go back to the Dick Cheney old world view because they're donor masters.
[01:19:54.444 --> 01:19:55.845]  That's exactly how they make money.
[01:19:56.465 --> 01:19:57.866]  But I reject that vision.
[01:19:57.986 --> 01:20:01.968]  So for me, yes, if you're going to go after the swamp, is the swamp going to strike back?
[01:20:02.249 --> 01:20:02.829]  Absolutely.
[01:20:03.009 --> 01:20:03.669]  They already are.
[01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:09.533]  If you're going to go after America First foreign policy, is the military industrial complex going to be upset about that and strike back?
[01:20:09.593 --> 01:20:10.333]  Yes, they will.
[01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:15.876]  But if you're guided by your sense of purpose, and I really mean that, I think God put each of us here for a purpose.
[01:20:16.216 --> 01:20:17.137]  We're here to pursue it.
[01:20:17.697 --> 01:20:18.097]  Well, you know what?
[01:20:18.117 --> 01:20:19.799]  I don't think anything's going to stop us.
[01:20:20.019 --> 01:20:25.844]  And this country has given me and my family more than we could have ever wished for or imagined.
[01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:27.165]  My parents came here with no money.
[01:20:27.846 --> 01:20:29.307]  I couldn't have wished for another thing in this country.
[01:20:29.327 --> 01:20:30.768]  We were raising two young sons.
[01:20:31.329 --> 01:20:33.731]  My wife is living her version of the American dream.
[01:20:33.751 --> 01:20:37.774]  She's a surgeon saving lives every day at Ohio State Hospital here in Ohio.
[01:20:38.695 --> 01:20:40.917]  The question is, how do we give back to this country?
[01:20:41.057 --> 01:20:51.685]  And so yes, my view is, it's going to take somebody coming from the outside, with fresh legs, from the next generation, to take our America First movement to the next level.
[01:20:51.705 --> 01:20:52.586]  No, I totally agree.
[01:20:52.606 --> 01:20:53.486]  That's why I'm in this.
[01:20:53.707 --> 01:20:54.007]  Totally.
[01:20:54.047 --> 01:20:57.409]  And that's why I brought up Javier Malay.
[01:20:57.449 --> 01:20:57.850]  He's great.
[01:20:58.110 --> 01:21:01.773]   And the rest of it is, People are hungry for young, smart people.
[01:21:01.793 --> 01:21:03.674]  We don't care what color they are.
[01:21:04.074 --> 01:21:09.438]  We care that they believe in the country and believe in humanity and don't want to be part of this predator class.
[01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:11.800]  And so obviously you don't want to climb over the dead body of Trump.
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:16.183]  But I really respect Tucker Carlson's view and I've had the same view and so does Jack Posobiec.
[01:21:16.923 --> 01:21:17.644]  One way or another.
[01:21:18.949 --> 01:21:19.310]  They're not.
[01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:21.633]  I mean, they, I believe, will blow his airplane up.
[01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:24.197]  And I'm not trying to be a prophet here and say it's going to happen.
[01:21:24.277 --> 01:21:28.402]  I can just see the trajectory and the escalation of the deep state.
[01:21:28.563 --> 01:21:32.007]  And I'm just simply being honest here, not trying to be macabre.
[01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.289]  You're a smart guy.
[01:21:33.329 --> 01:21:34.050]  You've thought this through.
[01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.991]  You said, yes, I have.
[01:21:36.084 --> 01:21:39.707]  As soon as they're done destroying him, they're going to move on to you.
[01:21:39.747 --> 01:21:44.010]  And I think the viewers and listeners need to realize that this is serious.
[01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:50.955]  They already sent a guy, you know, clearly with all these weapons and the rest of it, you know, to RFK's event, and they won't give him Secret Service protection.
[01:21:51.275 --> 01:21:56.680]  So I just want viewers to recognize you are a man in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about, and I admire that.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.022]  So you asked the question, I see you all over TV, why are they cowards?
[01:22:00.042 --> 01:22:03.665]  And I think the final equation is because they know they'll get indicted if their head's blown off.
[01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:08.144]  And the answer is you stand up to the system, the system will crush you.
[01:22:08.184 --> 01:22:09.105]  That's what it's meant to do.
[01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:10.686]  But my view is this.
[01:22:11.466 --> 01:22:14.249]  If you're guided by your sense of actual purpose, right?
[01:22:14.289 --> 01:22:17.872]  If you believe that you're put here for a purpose, you don't stop till you achieve it.
[01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:19.473]  That's the way I've lived my life.
[01:22:19.593 --> 01:22:21.194]  And so you can't live in fear.
[01:22:21.635 --> 01:22:23.897]  If you're going to live in fear, you're not cut out to life.
[01:22:24.037 --> 01:22:25.318]  The whole point of life is pointless.
[01:22:25.338 --> 01:22:26.018]  There's more to life.
[01:22:26.119 --> 01:22:28.120]  I totally agree.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.161]  I'm not trying to talk you out of it.
[01:22:29.201 --> 01:22:31.443]  I'm saying, yeah, and again, we're ready.
[01:22:31.663 --> 01:22:33.465]  We're ready for it, is the answer, Alex.
[01:22:34.125 --> 01:22:34.725]  I'm ready for it.
[01:22:34.865 --> 01:22:36.586]  We know what we're getting our way into.
[01:22:37.006 --> 01:22:46.168]  You strike the swamp, it'll strike back, but take out the deep state at home, declare independence from China abroad, revive the ideals of the American Revolution in this country.
[01:22:46.188 --> 01:22:48.009]  That much I think we can do.
[01:22:48.329 --> 01:22:50.650]  And I think that we're working with a short window of time.
[01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:52.350]  We don't have a lot of time we're working with.
[01:22:52.630 --> 01:22:54.651]  20 years from now, I don't think we have a country left.
[01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:58.632]  But if we get this right in this window, I think this might be our last best chance to do it.
[01:22:59.212 --> 01:23:00.673]  That's what gives me my sense of urgency.
[01:23:00.733 --> 01:23:08.176]  And so yeah, I think as a guy from a little bit of a different generation coming from the outside, not bought and paid for, independently able to do this myself.
[01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.297]  Yeah, I think that's our last best chance.
[01:23:10.317 --> 01:23:11.418]  That's what guides me to do this.
[01:23:11.978 --> 01:23:15.340]  I'm optimistic that we have a chance to actually get this done.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.100]  Trump built a great foundation.
[01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:20.782]  Now we get to build on that foundation to take this to the next level.
[01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:24.224]  That deep state at home, it's the real dirty little secret of politics.
[01:23:24.864 --> 01:23:29.048]  The people who we elect to run the government, not even Biden, they're not the ones who actually run the government.
[01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:32.031]  It is the cancerous bureaucracy underneath.
[01:23:32.232 --> 01:23:33.293]  And that's my next question.
[01:23:33.313 --> 01:23:34.194]  You talk a lot about this.
[01:23:34.214 --> 01:23:35.154]  With corporate power to do it.
[01:23:35.455 --> 01:23:37.297]  How do we take out the deep state non-violently?
[01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:41.813]  Yeah, so you gotta get in there and have somebody who understands the Constitution.
[01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:46.516]  We have the current Supreme Court right now that agrees with me on this.
[01:23:46.936 --> 01:23:48.898]  75% reduction in the number of federal bureaucrats.
[01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:50.179]  That happens instantly.
[01:23:50.719 --> 01:23:52.741]  Shut down agencies one by one.
[01:23:53.201 --> 01:23:59.066]  IRS, FBI, ATF, Department of Education, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, CDC.
[01:23:59.466 --> 01:24:01.067]  You can't reform them, right?
[01:24:01.247 --> 01:24:05.090]  Other Republican candidates will think they're really novel when they say, fire Christopher Wray.
[01:24:05.931 --> 01:24:07.233]  That's the least of it.
[01:24:07.313 --> 01:24:08.034]  It's a sideshow.
[01:24:08.114 --> 01:24:09.195]  It's the machine underneath.
[01:24:09.235 --> 01:24:10.236]  You have to shut it down.
[01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:21.390]  So, against that backdrop, the Supreme Court agrees with me right now that the duly elected President of the United States can do it, absolutely, with constitutional authority.
[01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:22.752]  So this is our window to get it right.
[01:24:23.192 --> 01:24:25.473]  I give Trump credit giving us that great Supreme Court.
[01:24:25.873 --> 01:24:27.153]  We win six to three.
[01:24:27.613 --> 01:24:38.316]  So this is going through the front door, shutting down agencies, lay off 75% of the federal bureaucrats, rescind a majority of those regulations that are unconstitutional coming from that deep state.
[01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:42.197]  This is our moment to get it right because the current Supreme Court is aligned with us.
[01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:46.578]  Get in there and actually it's going to take somebody who knows that, you know, I've been a CEO.
[01:24:46.598 --> 01:24:51.480]   I know if somebody works for you and you can't fire them, That means they don't work for you.
[01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:56.846]  It means you work for them because you're responsible for what they do without any authority to change it.
[01:24:57.167 --> 01:24:58.728]  And I'm not going to be a passive puppet.
[01:24:59.009 --> 01:25:00.971]  And Article 2 of the Constitution says the U.S.
[01:25:01.051 --> 01:25:03.674]  President runs the executive branch of government.
[01:25:04.054 --> 01:25:05.416]  So yes, that's the way I'm going to do things.
[01:25:05.676 --> 01:25:07.017]  Get in there and do it.
[01:25:07.278 --> 01:25:08.679]  Alex, you've got to do this in the first 6 to 18 months.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:16.122]  If we don't get this done and, you know, if we're not halfway to doing the things I told you by September of 2025, game over.
[01:25:16.543 --> 01:25:21.044]  Because if you give them time, you do this incrementally, boom, they've got you in a trap.
[01:25:21.484 --> 01:25:29.847]  But if you get in there quickly and don't even focus on Congress, I think that's a problem where sometimes you can get distracted as a president trying to pass legislation.
[01:25:29.867 --> 01:25:30.387]  No, you're right.
[01:25:30.407 --> 01:25:31.648]  It's been the agencies making laws.
[01:25:31.847 --> 01:25:35.686]   law and you're right about the Supreme Court rulings. They said all these agencies making
[01:25:35.686 --> 01:25:40.046]   law on carbon and everything is a fraud so all you've got to do is have the president
[01:25:40.046 --> 01:25:44.967]   put new people in or shut the agencies down. You're absolutely right. Congress has become
[01:25:44.967 --> 01:25:51.967]   a vestigial creature to the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy is the enemy.
[01:25:52.937 --> 01:25:57.139]  And so I don't want to make the mistakes that other presidents have, try to pass legislation through Congress in the first year.
[01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:57.399]  No.
[01:25:57.999 --> 01:26:00.339]  You can't give the swamp time to strike back.
[01:26:00.379 --> 01:26:05.061]  So I get in there, first six months, focus exclusively on the executive branch.
[01:26:05.521 --> 01:26:06.521]  Shut down the deep state.
[01:26:06.601 --> 01:26:06.821]  Forget it.
[01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.202]  We'll get to Congress the year after.
[01:26:08.502 --> 01:26:09.402]  They can sit in the sidelines.
[01:26:09.422 --> 01:26:10.722]  They can go to the beach for all I care.
[01:26:11.283 --> 01:26:12.083]  Get that done.
[01:26:12.303 --> 01:26:14.384]  Fix the actual bureaucratic cancer.
[01:26:14.884 --> 01:26:18.125]  Then in year two, we start passing actually good laws and going through Congress.
[01:26:18.145 --> 01:26:19.305]  And by the way, that's why they're so scared.
[01:26:19.665 --> 01:26:25.410]  That's why they're so scared of Trump getting back in, because he now understands what we now understand in hindsight.
[01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:27.412]  And the deep state is unpopular.
[01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:28.573]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:26:28.593 --> 01:26:31.316]  90% of people don't like the things it's pushing.
[01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:37.081]  And so as long as we just cut the heads off, non-violently, but remove them, they have no more power.
[01:26:37.421 --> 01:26:41.625]  But that's why they're so insecure, because they realize how tenuous their hold is.
[01:26:42.105 --> 01:26:42.866]  We had a 1776 revolution.
[01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:49.133]  India had one, and people went through hell to do it.
[01:26:49.213 --> 01:26:50.134]  So many other revolutions.
[01:26:50.194 --> 01:26:54.439]  We can do this so peacefully if we just get a good president in that understands.
[01:26:54.739 --> 01:26:59.325]  In the time we have, there's so many other issues I could raise, but closing comments to our audience, Vivek.
[01:27:00.512 --> 01:27:02.973]  I'd say, look, Donald Trump, he rolled that log over.
[01:27:03.193 --> 01:27:04.594]  We saw what crawled out.
[01:27:05.254 --> 01:27:06.674]  I am bringing the pest aside.
[01:27:06.714 --> 01:27:07.095]  All right.
[01:27:07.135 --> 01:27:11.136]  So if I'm in that office, I will take him as my most valued mentor and advisor.
[01:27:11.176 --> 01:27:14.377]  But it's going to be all of us playing our role to clean this up.
[01:27:14.758 --> 01:27:17.399]  And the last thing I'll say is maybe a bridge to a future conversation.
[01:27:17.859 --> 01:27:19.799]  The swamp doesn't just exist in the government.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.481]  It exists in our other institutions in the private sector, too.
[01:27:23.941 --> 01:27:26.182]  So it is this government industrial complex.
[01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:28.163]  That's where I was going, that was my last question.
[01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:29.705]  I forgot to ask him.
[01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:54.345]  The censorship, I mean, Professor Epstein, they're documenting, they're already stealing it again right now with the controls, not at the ballot box, but with big tech, blocking news, blocking stories, the Hunter laptops, iconic and an example of that archetypal, but obviously you having the courage to have me on, that's a symbol of, we don't all agree with things, but let everybody get to speak, as Bill Maher says, can you speak to the First Amendment and the censorship?
[01:27:55.427 --> 01:27:56.848]  So I'm a free speech absolutist.
[01:27:56.988 --> 01:27:58.389]  That's what this country was founded on.
[01:27:58.889 --> 01:28:03.432]  Even speech I disagree with from the other side, I will always stand for their right to say it.
[01:28:03.852 --> 01:28:05.273]  That's what it means to be an American.
[01:28:05.693 --> 01:28:15.940]  But what the government's doing today is they're using these tech companies to censor speech through the back door that government could not censor through the front door under the Constitution.
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:19.842]  They're threatening companies to say, if you don't take this down, then we're going to regulate you or break you up.
[01:28:20.202 --> 01:28:20.743]  Well, guess what?
[01:28:20.783 --> 01:28:22.284]  That's a violation of the Constitution.
[01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:26.849]  If it is state action in disguise, the Constitution still applies.
[01:28:27.249 --> 01:28:27.650]  Period.
[01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:30.694]  So I swear an oath as the next President to the U.S.
[01:28:30.754 --> 01:28:33.036]  Constitution, we'll put an end to those behaviors.
[01:28:33.076 --> 01:28:33.877]  And here's what I'm going to do.
[01:28:34.718 --> 01:28:46.210]   Any time a government official has pressured a private actor over the last 10 years To take action that the government actor couldn't take directly, we're going to publish it for the whole public to see.
[01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:49.052]  Elon Musk did a version of that at Twitter with one company.
[01:28:49.432 --> 01:28:50.693]  We're going to do that across the board.
[01:28:51.053 --> 01:28:53.115]  We're going to see how ugly this problem really is.
[01:28:53.555 --> 01:28:56.537]  And then that's unconstitutional behavior right there.
[01:28:56.978 --> 01:28:58.539]  So I'll swear an oath to the Constitution.
[01:28:58.879 --> 01:28:59.720]  I intend to keep it.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.863]  That's exactly how we start with free speech and open debate in this country.
[01:29:04.483 --> 01:29:07.067]  And I say this to people on the right as well, right?
[01:29:07.087 --> 01:29:12.595]  I mean, you've got certain people saying on college campuses, you know, we have to ban speech that's anti-Israel.
[01:29:12.635 --> 01:29:19.725]  You see, Ron DeSantis just apparently instructed Florida universities to say that they cannot, they have to disband certain student groups.
[01:29:20.766 --> 01:29:25.950]  Now, my view is, I think these student groups are insane, being pro-Palestinian or whatever they're saying.
[01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:29.693]  They're saying some nonsense, but I preach this left, right, it doesn't matter.
[01:29:29.753 --> 01:29:31.434]  I'm a free speech absolutist.
[01:29:31.834 --> 01:29:33.716]  You can't ban speech you don't like.
[01:29:34.116 --> 01:29:40.239]   That's what it means to be an American, and for me, It's one thing if you're a political partisan and you're just doing what's popular that day.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.081]  It's another if you're actually grounded in principles.
[01:29:43.121 --> 01:29:44.841]  So I'll preach this to the left.
[01:29:44.881 --> 01:29:46.902]  I'll preach it to the Republican Party or anybody else.
[01:29:47.362 --> 01:29:48.883]  Free speech is the American way.
[01:29:49.003 --> 01:29:52.224]  And if you tell people they can't speak, that is when they scream.
[01:29:52.764 --> 01:29:56.626]  If you tell people they can't scream, that is when they tear things down.
[01:29:57.146 --> 01:30:01.308]  So in some ways, free speech is a precondition for peace in this country.
[01:30:01.328 --> 01:30:01.728]  That's right.
[01:30:01.808 --> 01:30:04.249]  And I'm keen to make sure that we do this correctly.
[01:30:04.429 --> 01:30:05.152]  I totally agree.
[01:30:05.674 --> 01:30:14.093]   JFK, when he was president, I'll butcher it, but he said, those that make peaceful Demonstration impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:30:14.433 --> 01:30:15.093]  And that's where we are.
[01:30:15.173 --> 01:30:20.054]  And when I first saw you come on the scene, I read your book years ago and knew who you were and saw what you were saying.
[01:30:20.094 --> 01:30:26.575]  But when you first showed up on the scene and your numbers were just a few digits, I said, man, this is the smartest guy out there.
[01:30:27.175 --> 01:30:28.136]  This is really exciting.
[01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:33.117]  And I said, regardless of whether he wins or not, he's doing an invaluable service of educating people.
[01:30:33.157 --> 01:30:34.817]  And maybe he gets elected president down the road.
[01:30:35.117 --> 01:30:38.478]  But now, because of all the factors, you have a real shot at it.
[01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:39.418]  People should go.
[01:30:39.858 --> 01:30:42.378]  to your site, they should check it out.
[01:30:42.378 --> 01:30:48.858]   Vivek, that's V-I-V-E-K 2024.com, vivek2024.com, and follow you on Twitter.
[01:30:48.858 --> 01:30:50.858]  Thank you so much, we look forward to speaking to you again.
[01:30:50.858 --> 01:30:52.257]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:30:52.257 --> 01:30:54.257]  Alright, wow, thank you, sir.
[01:30:54.257 --> 01:30:58.458]   Real guy, folks, they absolutely hate him, they're coming after him, and
[01:30:58.458 --> 01:31:00.458]  that's what's going on here.
[01:31:00.467 --> 01:31:04.151]  So we are very, very excited to be talking to him and having him on air.
[01:31:04.171 --> 01:31:09.116]  That's what it's all about is to have a wider open discussion and wider open debate.
[01:31:09.196 --> 01:31:13.481]  So I look forward to speaking to Vivek again in the near future.
[01:31:13.941 --> 01:31:21.870]  Now, the next clip I'm going to go to is so important that I don't even have words to describe it.
[01:31:24.895 --> 01:31:25.996]  Couldn't sleep last night.
[01:31:26.256 --> 01:31:26.796]  Got out of bed.
[01:31:26.816 --> 01:31:27.877]  I went to bed at like 10 o'clock, about 11.
[01:31:28.057 --> 01:31:28.877]  I just said, I can't sleep.
[01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:31.118]  So, it only happens every once in a while.
[01:31:31.138 --> 01:31:38.042]  But I went down to the computer and I spent like three hours just doing research and, you know, doing what I do.
[01:31:38.863 --> 01:31:43.085]  And I came across the six-minute clip I'm about to play.
[01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:48.028]  And then I ended up watching like an hour of the actual testimony.
[01:31:48.188 --> 01:31:57.979]   And man, the fact that the federal government, and he's right, they've got Like, seven, eight years of reports.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:09.288]  But the last Senate report before Obama left office admitted hundreds of thousands of children smuggled in, tens of thousands of sex slavery, and since then it's 400 plus thousand, 80-something thousand, they don't even know where they're at.
[01:32:09.429 --> 01:32:10.489]  I mean, think about that.
[01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:12.011]  One child's missing, it's a big deal.
[01:32:12.591 --> 01:32:13.212]  And it should be.
[01:32:14.454 --> 01:32:18.458]  And he's talking to the head of the program, and they're just giving excuses and going over this.
[01:32:18.859 --> 01:32:27.287]  And the New York Times knows this is coming out, so they're just talking about manual labor of 10-year-olds that don't go to school and don't get dinner and are used as slave labor.
[01:32:27.327 --> 01:32:27.808]  That's bad enough.
[01:32:27.868 --> 01:32:29.570]  No, a bunch of them are sex slaves.
[01:32:31.231 --> 01:32:39.941]   So if you wonder who this government is and what they stand for and who they are, this crime is so massive, how could anyone Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:32:39.961 --> 01:32:40.021]  Ms.
[01:32:40.102 --> 01:32:42.043]  Marcos, can I just start with you?
[01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:46.745]  You testified a moment ago to Senator Butler that every child gets a know-your-rights presentation.
[01:32:46.585 --> 01:32:50.463]   bringing in new voters. They are literally exploiting the living hell out
[01:32:50.463 --> 01:32:54.355]  of them. Here's part of the testimony. Senator Hawley.
[01:32:54.355 --> 01:32:55.824]  Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[01:32:55.824 --> 01:32:59.423]   Ms. Marcos, can I just start with you? You testified a moment ago to Senator
[01:32:59.423 --> 01:33:02.494]  Butler that every child gets a "know your rights"
[01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:05.463]  presentation. Is that correct?
[01:33:05.463 --> 01:33:08.904]  That is correct.
[01:33:07.304 --> 01:33:10.146]  Is that before or after you release them to labor traffickers?
[01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:26.719]  Senator, every child that comes into our care gets a Know Your Rights presentation as well as... Have you read these New York Times reports, these stories, the series of stories the New York Times has done on the children who are in your care?
[01:33:26.739 --> 01:33:27.239]  Have you read them?
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.400]  Yes, I have.

[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.000]  She's like, yeah, there's 400,000 kids we just brought in.
[01:39:42.091 --> 01:39:43.713]  Yeah, we handed them over to people we don't know who they are.
[01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:46.034]  Can you call them?
[01:39:46.054 --> 01:39:49.877]  Well, not most of them.
[01:39:49.897 --> 01:39:52.159]  89,000 or 87,000 are just completely gone.
[01:39:52.219 --> 01:39:52.999]  They don't know where they're at.
[01:39:53.019 --> 01:39:53.720]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:58.403]  And then he reads transcripts of meetings with the head of the program.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.722]  Well, they're like, we want them faster.
[01:40:01.783 --> 01:40:02.623]  We don't want any record.
[01:40:02.643 --> 01:40:04.165]  Remember what Biden did three months ago?
[01:40:04.525 --> 01:40:09.211]  He stopped the hundred and something dollar test that only takes like five hours to do.
[01:40:09.711 --> 01:40:14.757]  And they can tell if somebody is an uncle, a dad, a mom, a cousin, a third cousin.
[01:40:14.777 --> 01:40:15.537]  That's how good it is.
[01:40:15.898 --> 01:40:19.141]  They can do a genetic test.
[01:40:19.221 --> 01:40:21.124]  It's like a paternity test, but it's a family test.
[01:40:21.624 --> 01:40:30.928]  So like, hey, you don't look like their dad, or you got these drugged out kids that are on fentanyl, you know, a two-year-old, a five-year-old, they're passed out, you got them wrapped up in sleeping bags with ropes tying them up.
[01:40:31.808 --> 01:40:33.989]  And this is every day, thousands just surging.
[01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:36.670]  And they're like, do you keep track?
[01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:37.730]  No, we just let them have them.
[01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:41.692]  I mean, the government's gone, folks.
[01:40:43.652 --> 01:40:46.614]  And we're gone if we don't get funds to keep this operation on air.
[01:40:46.674 --> 01:40:48.474]  Don't make me prove it by shutting down.
[01:40:48.674 --> 01:40:50.315]  If you fund us, we're not going anywhere.
[01:40:51.277 --> 01:40:52.338]  Plus, we got great products.
[01:40:53.038 --> 01:40:53.418]  You need.
[01:40:54.078 --> 01:40:55.879]  So I told you the other sale was going to end.
[01:40:55.939 --> 01:40:56.440]  It's over.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.582]  But Brain Force Ultra, that's different than Brain Force Plus.
[01:41:00.622 --> 01:41:01.862]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:06.765]  It's like apples and oranges or pineapples and watermelons.
[01:41:06.825 --> 01:41:08.186]  It's two different deals.
[01:41:08.726 --> 01:41:10.667]  Brain Force Ultra hits really quick.
[01:41:12.819 --> 01:41:14.881]  And then it dissipates in about two to four hours.
[01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:18.043]  That way I can, if I gotta stay up late, I'm exhausted, coffee doesn't work.
[01:41:18.604 --> 01:41:20.145]  Once I'm at night, it makes me sleepy, actually.
[01:41:20.565 --> 01:41:23.067]  I can be at nine o'clock, gotta do a show at like 11 for an hour.
[01:41:23.388 --> 01:41:24.188]  Boom, hit this.
[01:41:25.249 --> 01:41:25.990]  Totally clean.
[01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:27.231]  Go to bed in three, four hours.
[01:41:28.859 --> 01:41:31.979]  It's 60% off, Brain Force Ultra is a fan favorite.
[01:41:31.979 --> 01:41:35.059]   Immune support, so important going into the fall and winter to get that.

[01:41:36.899 --> 01:41:42.538]   All of these trace elements and amino acids and anti-cancer stuff just flushes you out.
[01:41:42.538 --> 01:41:44.659]  So 60% off, Brain Force Ultra.

[01:42:13.938 --> 01:42:16.259]  The Great Awakening at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:16.259 --> 01:42:23.339]   Now about to talk about something really historic and very, very exciting.
[01:42:23.339 --> 01:42:26.339]  There's a lot of angles to this in the limited time we have.
[01:42:26.624 --> 01:42:34.206]  But America has been a special place because we aspired to liberty and freedom when nobody else was aspiring to it.
[01:42:34.586 --> 01:42:50.131]  We weren't perfect, we were far from it, but it was a place where experiments were allowed and where people could really try to prove themselves, not because of what family they came from or because they were from royalty, but a meritocracy based on what they could produce, what they could do.
[01:42:50.891 --> 01:43:00.514]  There were two things that really fueled and funded the colonies and the launch of America in 1776, and both of them are interesting.
[01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:05.555]  Both of them have dark histories, but both of them are something that you can enjoy responsibly.
[01:43:06.415 --> 01:43:12.677]  That's, of course, tobacco and the Virginia colony, and that's, of course, whiskey.
[01:43:14.268 --> 01:43:22.455]  And Sam Adams with whiskey and beer was one of the main boosters and funders, in fact probably the biggest funder, of George Washington and our troops.
[01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:23.997]  So it was whiskey and beer.
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:33.185]  Wine, the liberals love to drink, I'm not against wine, it's just a fact, that literally fuel the start of our country, along with this, tobacco.
[01:43:33.746 --> 01:43:37.349]  And I enjoy both, but I've really gotten good over the years at being responsible.
[01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:43.694]  Sometimes I might go four months, that's the longest I've gone in the last few years, with no tobacco, or no alcohol.
[01:43:44.075 --> 01:43:52.062]  But when I'm with friends, when I'm with family, when I'm with patriots, I enjoy both of them, and they go together like a horse and carriage.
[01:43:54.023 --> 01:44:02.993]  Two years ago, I got approached by great patriots from some of my connections who are major craft whiskey producers in Kentucky.
[01:44:03.514 --> 01:44:08.279]  So they brought me dozens of these amazing whiskeys that they had developed.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  And it also procured.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:13.881]  And out of all of them, I like this Kentucky Straight bourbon.
[01:44:14.561 --> 01:44:16.622]  Again, I'm no whiskey connoisseur.
[01:44:16.662 --> 01:44:24.123]  I just know what tastes good, what I like, what feels good, which doesn't give you that big hangover after.
[01:44:24.363 --> 01:44:28.044]  I liked, out of dozens, over a dozen I tried, this whiskey.
[01:44:28.504 --> 01:44:31.605]  Now, the bad news is they only had so many barrels of it.
[01:44:32.828 --> 01:44:34.469]  And so it's a limited supply.
[01:44:34.509 --> 01:44:39.412]  There's 10,000 bottles of this as of the time I'm cutting this.
[01:44:40.293 --> 01:44:41.493]  And it is amazing.
[01:44:41.613 --> 01:44:50.359]  And it's been ready for a year because of leftists trying to block it being in stores and behind the scenes harassment and debanking and stuff of this major whiskey company.
[01:44:51.059 --> 01:44:52.781]  This has been in the warehouse for a year.
[01:44:53.301 --> 01:45:00.127]  So it wasn't just aged for the years it was in the barrels, it's been aged by their censorship and went from amazing to incredible.
[01:45:00.588 --> 01:45:02.810]  So, it's a very special bottle too.
[01:45:03.868 --> 01:45:07.591]  That's why we have all these government documents here in front of me right here.
[01:45:08.032 --> 01:45:14.557]  Because if you aim a blacklight at Conspiracy Bourbon, ConspiracyBourbon.com is the only place to get it.
[01:45:14.998 --> 01:45:22.144]  It's got all of these hidden messages on it, on the front and on the back.
[01:45:22.164 --> 01:45:23.825]  So like I said, this is really, really special.
[01:45:24.265 --> 01:45:25.807]  Limited run, only place to get it.
[01:45:26.327 --> 01:45:30.411]  We have the conspiracy imperatives, 10 of them, kind of the 10 commandments.
[01:45:32.261 --> 01:45:35.982]  There's only 10,000 bottles of this at ConspiracyBourbon.com.
[01:45:38.303 --> 01:45:39.244]  Destroy the tyrants.
[01:45:39.264 --> 01:45:40.344]  It just goes on and on.
[01:45:40.904 --> 01:45:42.565]  This is very, very special.
[01:45:43.265 --> 01:45:46.187]  I would imagine that most people that get this are never going to open it.
[01:45:46.847 --> 01:45:50.488]  Gut level, I think this is going to be a major collector's item.
[01:45:50.508 --> 01:45:52.269]  We could have sold it for $200 in the market.
[01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:56.271]  It's 60-something bucks instead, and it's a fundraiser for the operation.
[01:45:56.511 --> 01:45:58.111]  We're really, really, really, really proud of it.
[01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:10.379]   So while you're hanging out with your friends, your family, your co-workers, you name it, It's really important to remember what Americana is all about, and if you are somebody that likes a fine whiskey, well, this is it, and it funds the Infowar.
[01:46:10.939 --> 01:46:12.821]  A true 360 win.
[01:46:13.401 --> 01:46:18.044]  For myself, the entire Infowars crew, here's to you, and here's to America.
[01:46:18.425 --> 01:46:26.130]  This isn't some Dylan Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch, transgenderism, you know, Creepazoid targeting our children.
[01:46:26.671 --> 01:46:37.033]   This is high-quality American Kentucky, Whiskey, Kentucky bourbon, funding the second American Revolution against tyrants.
[01:46:37.513 --> 01:46:41.615]  So here's to all the past patriots, the current patriots, and future patriots.
[01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:44.537]  This drink of conspiracy is for you.
[01:46:46.878 --> 01:46:49.539]  One place to get it, conspiracybourbon.com.
[01:46:49.799 --> 01:46:55.082]  And believe me, this is gonna sell out quick, so if you want it, get yourself a bottle today at conspiracybourbon.com.
[01:46:55.462 --> 01:46:58.904]  Well, they say the first casualty of war is the truth.
[01:47:00.382 --> 01:47:06.123]  And I normally got about a 95% accuracy rate, but when wars start, my numbers go down.
[01:47:06.203 --> 01:47:09.164]  But nothing like corporate controlled media that's lying on purpose.
[01:47:10.044 --> 01:47:17.286]  So I've been trying to decipher all the different factions and groups and what this new war means in the Middle East.
[01:47:18.386 --> 01:47:22.927]  But Patrick M. Byrne is the former CEO of Overstock.com.
[01:47:23.787 --> 01:47:24.888]  He's also a friend of the show.
[01:47:24.908 --> 01:47:25.928]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:47:27.662 --> 01:47:35.552]  And the intel I heard about from callers a few days ago, and I went and watched his presentation, was very similar to the intel I was getting from a lot of sources.
[01:47:36.333 --> 01:47:38.335]  And again, I'm not a Likudnik.
[01:47:38.896 --> 01:47:39.997]  I don't have a dog in the fight.
[01:47:40.718 --> 01:47:44.322]  The Israeli parliamentary system is just as confusing as Canada or the UK.
[01:47:45.814 --> 01:47:53.301]  But the globalists, Yuval Noah Harari, the WEF, the Rothschilds, the Economist magazine they own, they want him out.
[01:47:53.881 --> 01:47:58.226]  So let's just talk about why that is, and then pull back here.
[01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:07.141]  And look at the stand down that happened on October 7th that Netanyahu said they're going to investigate once they quote defeated Hamas.
[01:48:07.741 --> 01:48:09.661]  And how could you have that historic stand down?
[01:48:10.382 --> 01:48:15.543]  And I was on the same track as Patrick M. Byrne, but he has more connections.
[01:48:15.563 --> 01:48:16.963]  He's a famous software engineer.
[01:48:17.583 --> 01:48:18.944]  And so he's in that world.
[01:48:19.124 --> 01:48:21.964]  So he's way more informed on it than I am.
[01:48:22.024 --> 01:48:24.565]  But trying to add all this up.
[01:48:25.425 --> 01:48:28.328]  And I see the corporate press say Netanyahu must be removed.
[01:48:28.348 --> 01:48:30.210]  85% of Israelis want him gone.
[01:48:30.951 --> 01:48:41.662]  I see that and then I see the left ally with Hamas and all these riots going on and taking over streets and pulling white people out and just all this racism being promoted.
[01:48:42.202 --> 01:48:43.504]  What's really behind this?
[01:48:43.543 --> 01:48:45.903]  So there's a lot of levels to this.
[01:48:45.903 --> 01:48:52.302]   And I appreciate Patrick on short notice coming on to kind of give his presentation again,
[01:48:52.302 --> 01:48:54.783]  but also then just get into the bigger picture.
[01:48:54.783 --> 01:48:57.222]  Obviously he knows a lot about what's happening to Trump.
[01:48:57.222 --> 01:48:59.903]   He was there in the White House, some of the White House meetings.
[01:48:59.903 --> 01:49:05.703]   I see a lot of people turning against Trump that said he was innocent before, which of course he is,
[01:49:05.703 --> 01:49:07.543]  now turning against him.
[01:49:07.543 --> 01:49:09.363]  There's a lot of angles to this.
[01:49:09.363 --> 01:49:13.983]   And Patrick's always got some real insight, kind of x-ray vision on this.
[01:49:13.927 --> 01:49:16.408]  So Patrick, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:49:16.428 --> 01:49:21.291]  You've got a magazine, you've got websites, you've got a lot of things on Twitter.
[01:49:21.331 --> 01:49:24.312]  Patrick Byrne, B-Y-R-N-E, Patrick Byrne.
[01:49:24.753 --> 01:49:26.394]  You've got DeepCapture.com.
[01:49:26.674 --> 01:49:28.094]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:49:28.114 --> 01:49:32.497]  You've got your Capital Times magazine that you inform people in D.C.
[01:49:32.617 --> 01:49:32.757]  on.
[01:49:33.477 --> 01:49:34.738]  So thank you so much for being here.
[01:49:36.119 --> 01:49:37.219]  Alex, good to be on with you.
[01:49:37.239 --> 01:49:37.780]  You look well.
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:38.460]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:40.509 --> 01:49:40.950]  Good to be honest.
[01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:41.971]  So where shall we start?
[01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:42.392]  Israel?
[01:49:42.512 --> 01:49:45.196]  What's happened and what really happened in Israel?
[01:49:45.817 --> 01:49:51.925]  Yes, I mean, because what you said really, a lot of my data points agree with that, but I'm still not sure.
[01:49:51.965 --> 01:49:55.491]  So yeah, tell us first your preface and your intel and then give us the big picture.
[01:49:56.701 --> 01:50:09.286]  Sure, I've been spending time in Israel the last few years because of, and by the way, I'm kind of in a cheap motel in West Africa, so pardon there's not really a great background to show you.
[01:50:10.127 --> 01:50:20.331]  I've been in the blockchain community in Israel on and off for the last four years, and there's a wonderful blockchain community, and there's a Silicon Valley in Israel.
[01:50:21.011 --> 01:50:27.196]  And that Silicon Valley takes people right out of the Israeli Defense Forces, right out of their version of the NSA.
[01:50:27.637 --> 01:50:31.080]  And that's often the Silicon Valley people there.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.941]  It's just on the beach near Tel Aviv.
[01:50:33.822 --> 01:50:37.785]  And that community really supports the Israeli intelligence.
[01:50:38.526 --> 01:50:44.729]   And there's a community and there's a lot of companies in that Israeli version of Silicon Valley.
[01:50:45.189 --> 01:51:03.083]  There's a lot of spinoffs that get going and they do cyber security, they do hacking, they do counter hacking, and Israel has maintained such an edge in intelligence because they're very tied into this, that very vibrant community of cyber security.
[01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:04.344]  And by the way, that's well known.
[01:51:04.384 --> 01:51:10.569]  I mean, Israel's like fourth in the world now, like China, Silicon Valley, a few other places.
[01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:12.471]  I mean, they're the top of the game.
[01:51:13.607 --> 01:51:13.847]  Right.
[01:51:14.648 --> 01:51:17.290]  And now there was one company there, Paragon.
[01:51:17.811 --> 01:51:34.524]  They got very deep connections in with the American Uniparty, and in particular, the Biden crew of Anthony Blinken, Avril Hines, and Dan Shapiro, who was President Obama's ambassador to Israel.
[01:51:35.305 --> 01:51:43.259]   And those people sat on the board of Paragon, and they had, and so since Biden has been in, This is so brilliant.
[01:51:43.319 --> 01:51:52.203]  Since Biden has been in, he's been writing executive orders and such that have effectively throttled the competition to Paragon.
[01:51:53.144 --> 01:52:12.453]   And how he's been doing that, there's a Canadian human rights NGO, I'm sure if you look into it, it's probably another George Soros fund, who knows, which puts out reports And alerts and, oh my gosh, this company, its software violates human rights or can be used by nations that violate human rights.
[01:52:12.993 --> 01:52:20.438]  And every time they do one, Biden writes executive orders that throttle or in some way harm that company.
[01:52:20.558 --> 01:52:25.401]  And in this way, they have picked off all the competitors to Paragon.
[01:52:25.801 --> 01:52:32.121]   And Paragon is connected, is politically connected to the head of the DNI, Avril Hines, and Antony
[01:52:32.121 --> 01:52:34.000]  Blinken, the Secretary of State.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.560]  So it's a dream setup.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:42.680]   They have used, and Ahud Barak on that side, on the Israeli side, and General Gantz, this
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.801]  guy General Gantz, who's now in the Netanyahu cabinet.
[01:52:47.161 --> 01:52:56.286]  They've been the Israeli side working in cahoots with Blinken and Averill Hines, getting, snuffing out the competition to Paragon.
[01:52:56.326 --> 01:53:02.770]  And why that's important is the Israeli intelligence service depended on that sort of vibrant, that other set of companies.
[01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:05.191]  So that's one of the reasons they went blind.
[01:53:05.531 --> 01:53:07.272]  Before I go on and tell you more... That's the bottom line.
[01:53:07.292 --> 01:53:12.815]  You're saying Israel's having its diverse private intelligence network blinded.
[01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:18.773]  Yeah, by these games that the old Biden administration's played.
[01:53:18.793 --> 01:53:23.856]  Let's remember, you say Biden is Obama.
[01:53:24.337 --> 01:53:30.201]  Obama did launch the Arab Spring, did overthrow Egypt, did all this, and is backing Hezbollah.
[01:53:30.221 --> 01:53:31.101]  But continue.
[01:53:32.602 --> 01:53:49.145]   Well, by backing the, by the Biden regime picking winners and losers through their political connections, They really suppressed one side of the Israeli cyber security industry, which has hurt the intelligence service.
[01:53:49.826 --> 01:53:54.007]  And then on top of that, there's this very interesting political dimension.
[01:53:54.887 --> 01:54:01.989]  There's a woman, I quoted her, and I put up an article, I mean, a podcast with about four links to it, you're welcome to use that.
[01:54:02.549 --> 01:54:09.761]   There's a woman There's a color revolution going on over there, and it's being run by the U.S.
[01:54:09.781 --> 01:54:11.683]  State Department against Netanyahu.
[01:54:11.783 --> 01:54:12.284]  It's crazy.
[01:54:12.724 --> 01:54:18.830]  These NGOs and state departments are taking out Netanyahu through a color revolution.
[01:54:19.411 --> 01:54:26.497]  And it's all about the reform of the judicial reform, which is a very interesting subject you should know about.
[01:54:30.337 --> 01:54:37.741]  The thing that is really freaking out the Israeli elite is that Netanyahu wants to change something about the judicial system.
[01:54:38.262 --> 01:54:40.423]  And the Israeli system is as follows.
[01:54:40.443 --> 01:54:42.204]  Are you following me or am I rambling on too long?
[01:54:42.244 --> 01:54:42.784]  No, no, no, you're right.
[01:54:42.804 --> 01:54:47.767]  I mean, because I've researched this now, and again, I'm not even a model of Kudnick, but it is true.
[01:54:47.807 --> 01:54:49.648]  They claim Netanyahu is becoming a dictator.
[01:54:50.068 --> 01:54:52.990]  But Yavol Hanourari and the WEF came out against Netanyahu.
[01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:54.050]  I looked into it.
[01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:56.832]  The Supreme Court is becoming a dictatorship.
[01:54:56.872 --> 01:54:58.693]  So it's the other way around is what you're saying.
[01:54:59.827 --> 01:55:13.660]  Yeah, there's this very strange rule in Israel, which does not have a written constitution, but the rule is that the Supreme Court can strike down any law that doesn't meet the fundamental principles of Israel.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.842]  It's this very vague definition.
[01:55:16.422 --> 01:55:26.953]   And so you have that going on, and you also have in the Israeli Supreme Court There are 88 people in history who have been on the Supreme Court and 87 of them have been Ashkenazi Jews.
[01:55:26.973 --> 01:55:29.594]  Do you know the difference between Ashkenazi and Sephardim Jews?
[01:55:29.714 --> 01:55:30.174]  Absolutely.
[01:55:30.214 --> 01:55:31.495]  Go ahead and tell folks.
[01:55:31.615 --> 01:55:38.377]  One is Russian, the other is what you call certified original or brown Jews.
[01:55:41.127 --> 01:55:46.711]  Yeah, Middle Eastern, some are more European, that's the Ashkenazi.
[01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:56.237]  Well, the elite of Israeli and certainly judiciary are the European Jews, 87 out of 88 in history.
[01:55:56.858 --> 01:56:06.173]   And so it's starting to become like the deplorable class, which is to say the Sephardim and the worker bees among the among the Ashkenazi.
[01:56:06.173 --> 01:56:10.534]   It's like they go through all the trouble of politics and elect people and get laws passed
[01:56:10.534 --> 01:56:14.653]   and then they have these snobs who are all the other type of Jews.
[01:56:14.653 --> 01:56:15.493]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:56:15.493 --> 01:56:21.253]   And I'm not demonizing Ashkenazi Jews, but the point is, in Israel with the ringworm children
[01:56:21.253 --> 01:56:28.253]   that came out in Israeli documents 20 years ago, they radiated Sephardic Jews, but not Ashkenazi,
[01:56:28.253 --> 01:56:32.534]   telling them we're treating you for ringworm and radiated them, some lethally,
[01:56:32.534 --> 01:56:36.773]   others just to basically, so it's another eugenics operation.
[01:56:36.773 --> 01:56:49.286]   I didn't, so it's like the Tuskegee experiments Yeah, but it's well known that the Sephardic Jews are the junior guys, yeah.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:57:11.504]  Right, and they feel that way, and the way they feel is that, gee, we go through all the trouble of politics and getting laws passed, and say the working class, I felt more like the working class Ashkenazi, and these people who look down their nose at us have their Supreme Court overturn it and say, well that violates the fundamental spirit of Israel.
[01:57:11.924 --> 01:57:16.225]  So is this... So you're saying Netanyahu is allied with the Sephardic?
[01:57:17.492 --> 01:57:18.373]  He wants to change that.
[01:57:18.433 --> 01:57:22.516]  He wants to say, no, the Supreme Court doesn't get this elitist power anymore.
[01:57:22.896 --> 01:57:25.338]  And that's the third rail of Israeli politics.
[01:57:25.458 --> 01:57:29.001]  And that's what's the organizing principle of this color revolution.
[01:57:29.481 --> 01:57:36.727]  And there was a woman, a leader in the color revolution, whose husband is a high level intelligence officer.
[01:57:36.787 --> 01:57:39.609]  I won't say any names, but he's a high level intelligence officer.
[01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:40.770]  And she went so far.
[01:57:41.230 --> 01:57:48.540]   Finally, on August 25th, Netanyahu got done a very modest Judicial reform, much smaller than he had promised.
[01:57:48.601 --> 01:58:02.308]  But that was enough for her to get up and promise in a crowd, I'm speaking for 1,200 people across the intelligence and security services, the lights are going to go out on Israeli intelligence at the end of September.
[01:58:02.428 --> 01:58:06.710]  And she made some kind of threat, like a retaliatory threat for what Netanyahu does.
[01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:07.350]  Well, guess what?
[01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:09.952]  At the end of September, Israel went blind.
[01:58:09.992 --> 01:58:11.853]  So you're saying they false flagged Netanyahu?
[01:58:13.576 --> 01:58:27.640]  She made this threat after August 25th, and if you look at my podcast, I've got four articles linked that document all this, from like Israeli- Well, it's on record that Israel's in a civil war, and will they be protected, and intelligence agencies are striking.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:29.881]  When you're an intelligence agency, you don't strike.
[01:58:30.401 --> 01:58:31.401]  But keep going.
[01:58:32.942 --> 01:58:34.302]  Especially on Yom Kippur.
[01:58:34.322 --> 01:58:36.183]  That happened once before.
[01:58:38.164 --> 01:58:46.691]  So yeah that's so it's really Israel if you really it looks like the Israeli intelligence spectacles fogged up at the end of September.
[01:58:47.483 --> 01:58:49.305]  And then they missed this on October 7th.
[01:58:49.745 --> 01:58:59.653]  Well, it turns out that that fogging up was something, A, predicted by some anti-Netanyahu protest leader who's connected deeply into Israeli intelligence.
[01:59:00.173 --> 01:59:24.550]   And secondly, the fogging came about fundamentally, I'm given to understand from the tech community folks I know, that it came about because these companies that have been snuffed out by the Biden administration through their executive order and export restriction kind of games, Because they did that, they snuffed out companies, and those companies were ones that the Israeli intelligence particularly relied upon.
[01:59:26.653 --> 01:59:43.599]  Well I read the Israeli newspapers where Hamas came across with obviously Iranian backing and knew with maps where to go and where the safe rooms were at Shin Bet and Mossad bases and then killed them on surveillance camera they had running and that basically somebody pulled most of the troops out of the bases.
[01:59:43.619 --> 01:59:46.060]  I mean that's that's obvious a stand down went on.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.841]  So the question is who did it and how did they do it?
[01:59:49.141 --> 01:59:52.903]  Well you want to know something funny else that no one else reported on Israel.
[01:59:54.535 --> 02:00:04.360]  Iran, six hours before the attack, put up two pictures.
[02:00:04.921 --> 02:00:09.783]  They put up a picture of Ahud Barak and General Gantz.
[02:00:10.523 --> 02:00:11.224]  No explanation.
[02:00:11.244 --> 02:00:13.405]  They just put up photographs of them in the middle of the night.
[02:00:14.505 --> 02:00:19.788]  Who are the two guys that I'm saying were the Israeli end of this little Kahootnik thing.
[02:00:20.368 --> 02:00:21.849]  And why would the Iranians do that?
[02:00:21.869 --> 02:00:23.110]  I know it's speculation, but why?
[02:00:24.816 --> 02:00:29.977]  Well, they were sending a signal, and they were embarrassing photos that showed they had been hacked.
[02:00:30.057 --> 02:00:37.219]  I've only heard them described, I haven't seen them, but I understand it's like one of them in his underwear with a bottle of whiskey kind of stuff.
[02:00:37.239 --> 02:00:42.080]  Nothing Hunter Biden level kind of stuff, but just like one of them in his underwear with a bottle of whiskey.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.220]  But it was to show that they had hacked these guys.
[02:00:45.821 --> 02:00:47.701]  And that they knew, and they would hold that as a card.
[02:00:49.102 --> 02:00:53.746]  And so what, yeah, so how do you put all, you now know what I know.
[02:00:53.786 --> 02:00:55.267]  Those pieces are connected somehow.
[02:00:55.727 --> 02:01:02.613]  But again, as you know so often the case, one thing we do know is the mainstream narrative is not true.
[02:01:03.874 --> 02:01:04.794]  There's much more to this.
[02:01:06.456 --> 02:01:08.637]  And then Biden keeps them from going in.
[02:01:08.677 --> 02:01:10.018]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[02:01:10.078 --> 02:01:10.559]  What are you hearing?
[02:01:14.335 --> 02:01:18.201]  Well, that gets I'm not that up on the news.
[02:01:18.261 --> 02:01:25.652]  I sort of deal with it more at the philosophical level of, of, you know, the just war kind of stuff.
[02:01:26.613 --> 02:01:34.519]   And one thing I should address I'd like to address two misconceptions and I've had a lot of exposure on the Arab side.
[02:01:34.659 --> 02:01:39.802]  I've also sort of, I often say I grew up, as I grew up I majored in Catholic, I minored in Jew.
[02:01:40.222 --> 02:01:43.704]  So I'm disclosing my roots and honestly and such.
[02:01:44.024 --> 02:01:51.108]  But I ended up in my 20s and thereafter spending a lot of time in the Muslim world and so I've kind of followed these issues for a while.
[02:01:52.759 --> 02:01:56.580]  The Israel was not, is not on stolen land.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.502]  Why don't you just say it, Patrick, as you've said it before when we've checked with folks, you've been a U.S.
[02:02:00.562 --> 02:02:04.443]  government intelligence operative for a long time.
[02:02:05.663 --> 02:02:07.464]  That's why I just, okay, but the point is, keep going.
[02:02:10.745 --> 02:02:17.047]  Israel, one thing needs to be understood, is Israel, if Israel's on stolen land, so is Saudi Arabia, so is Iraq.
[02:02:18.152 --> 02:02:35.061]  There was the Ottoman Empire was defeated in World War I and it was the consensus of the world in the San Remo Conference and the League of Nations in 1920 and 1922 and then the UN to create a Jewish homeland in that corpse of the Ottoman Empire.
[02:02:35.562 --> 02:02:37.083]  And we created a whole bunch of countries.
[02:02:37.503 --> 02:02:41.165]  And that's why Saudi Arabia says Israel has a right to exist because it's part of that deal.
[02:02:42.318 --> 02:02:44.899]  Yeah, they were all, they weren't stolen from the Ottoman Empire.
[02:02:44.959 --> 02:02:47.321]  The Ottoman Empire was defeated as part of the deal.
[02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:49.362]  We created, you know, did that.
[02:02:49.742 --> 02:02:51.383]  The world and the world signed off on it.
[02:02:51.563 --> 02:02:52.183]  So that's that.
[02:02:52.744 --> 02:03:04.870]  And as and then the second misconception is the concept of so I analyze this in terms of like real world dimension and then in terms of info war, I'm doing a real world legal dimension first.
[02:03:05.551 --> 02:03:16.074]   If they are a legitimate nation state, then of course, This thing from what Hamas did, of course they have the right to respond, and this thing about proportionality is misunderstood.
[02:03:16.134 --> 02:03:24.119]  The restriction under international law is not... The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, we nuke them.
[02:03:24.499 --> 02:03:26.140]  Once you start it, there's not proportionality.
[02:03:27.250 --> 02:03:37.693]  Well, the proportionality isn't between the numbers killed, it's does Israel have a legitimate military agenda, objective, and if so, are the means they use proportional to that?
[02:03:37.833 --> 02:03:41.054]  That's what the proportionality is about, not proportional to the number of people killed.
[02:03:41.074 --> 02:03:42.115]  To stop another attack, so.
[02:03:42.735 --> 02:03:53.390]   Yeah, and if their objective is to stop Hamas and get their hostages back, then that gives them a lot, they can do that and And kill a lot of people, and still it's not about that.
[02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:54.811]  Proportionality isn't to the numbers.
[02:03:54.831 --> 02:03:59.595]  But can they take the black eye, the setup, they're luring Netanyahu into the trap?
[02:03:59.675 --> 02:04:00.956]  And I think that's where we're going.
[02:04:01.977 --> 02:04:03.138]  That's the big question.
[02:04:03.338 --> 02:04:20.452]  From the InfoWars point of view, this is a disaster, because you know, and this also has to be said, for every Jewish Israeli who's been killed since in this, by the Palestinians in Gaza in the last 20 years, 23 have been killed in retaliation.
[02:04:21.061 --> 02:04:22.121]  So that's bad enough.
[02:04:22.581 --> 02:04:26.202]  I mean, and from a legal point of view, you can make the argument I just made.
[02:04:26.222 --> 02:04:28.362]  From an InfoWars point of view, that's a black eye.
[02:04:28.762 --> 02:04:38.304]  What they're going to have to do to achieve their objective in Gaza is going to look like the Holocaust, and people are going to say what some light to the world these people are.
[02:04:38.344 --> 02:04:39.304]  This is a Holocaust.
[02:04:39.765 --> 02:04:44.986]  So from the InfoWars point of view, the analysis is quite different than from the point of view of what's just.
[02:04:45.066 --> 02:04:45.646]  I agree.
[02:04:45.706 --> 02:04:50.762]   So the anti-Likudniks Let's just go with your premise, I think it's probably true.
[02:04:51.222 --> 02:04:58.487]  Netanyahu goes into a trap with the Persians, the Chai Kams, and the whole Obama-Globalist-Rothschild-Economist combine.
[02:04:58.587 --> 02:05:00.168]  What are they thinking in the synthesis?
[02:05:00.528 --> 02:05:05.232]  Just get rid of... They're doing all this just to get rid of Netanyahu?
[02:05:05.452 --> 02:05:08.854]  Because all of that blows back on Israel, not just Netanyahu and the Infowar.
[02:05:10.095 --> 02:05:11.016]  No, they're thinking bigger.
[02:05:11.056 --> 02:05:14.358]  And it's funny, you and I see the world just the same way.
[02:05:15.198 --> 02:05:17.320]  They're at the point they want to wrap the diamond.
[02:05:18.562 --> 02:05:18.982]  The U.S.
[02:05:19.042 --> 02:05:23.084]  after World War II tried to stitch together some international order such as it was.
[02:05:23.844 --> 02:05:38.085]   The alternative that they, which is a rules-based international order, the alternative that the BRICS are selling, that Russia and China are selling, is A bilateral relationship among seven different cultures.
[02:05:38.546 --> 02:05:47.374]  The Russian culture, the Chinese, the Indian, the South American, and I forget how they have African, and they have a nation in each of these continents.
[02:05:47.775 --> 02:05:51.198]  And that's the vision they are going for, and they want to break the diamond.
[02:05:51.238 --> 02:05:56.563]  They want to break it so that the first world, which is to say the developed world, gets carved off.
[02:05:57.123 --> 02:06:03.828]  And the second, you know, we think in terms of the first world and the third world, but we forget this third world's the less developed world.
[02:06:03.868 --> 02:06:05.849]  The second world, the whole world, forget about it.
[02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:10.632]  That's the developed, the, you know, that's partially developed.
[02:06:10.652 --> 02:06:16.196]  That's the Russia's of the world, the people with $10,000 or 20, $15,000 GDP per capita.
[02:06:16.677 --> 02:06:24.342]  So they want this issue at the Infowar point of view is going to split the world.
[02:06:24.462 --> 02:06:29.029]   So basically, The second world all joins the bricks.
[02:06:29.890 --> 02:06:32.814]  And so I think that this has been constructed very carefully.
[02:06:32.834 --> 02:06:39.023]  And obviously Hamas knew this wasn't just some little border incidents and drunk soldiers shooting at each other.
[02:06:39.063 --> 02:06:43.677]   This was planned to give To do to Israel something they had to avenge.
[02:06:43.777 --> 02:06:49.438]  Stealing babies and cutting their eyeballs out and rape and all this stuff that Israelis have to avenge.
[02:06:49.478 --> 02:06:52.139]  And 1,500 people, that's like 50,000 Americans.
[02:06:52.179 --> 02:07:00.441]  If Mexico came over and killed 50,000 Americans and stole 600 Americans, of course we'd have to react and so does Israel.
[02:07:01.741 --> 02:07:07.242]  But the guys calling the shots, the first level calling the shots, Hamas leadership are in Qatar, so they don't pay the price.
[02:07:07.282 --> 02:07:08.823]  They're using their people as human shields.
[02:07:09.383 --> 02:07:11.844]   It is the design Good for you to understand.
[02:07:12.184 --> 02:07:15.746]  It isn't like they haven't anticipated Israel's going to do what they're going to do.
[02:07:16.067 --> 02:07:24.792]  They want Israel to do what it's going to do because they're going to get footage of it and in the dimension of info war, it's going to be a nuclear weapon for them.
[02:07:24.832 --> 02:07:33.978]  They're going to get the whole world to side or a huge chunk of the world to really embrace the BRICS and desert the first world as it stands.
[02:07:35.159 --> 02:07:36.760]  So that's really the purpose here.
[02:07:38.405 --> 02:07:43.329]  I mean, I totally agree with the realpolitik analysis, not what side you're on.
[02:07:43.709 --> 02:07:54.397]  You're looking at this, this is where this is going, and clearly this is more and more looking like a trap to lead Netanyahu into this.
[02:07:55.327 --> 02:08:00.006]  They knew we were going to do this with our fleet.
[02:08:00.006 --> 02:08:03.967]   And it also makes me suspicious that Biden did it with such alacrity.
[02:08:03.967 --> 02:08:08.086]   Biden has become a left-wing Democrat and the left-wing Democrats do not stand behind
[02:08:08.086 --> 02:08:09.086]  Israel.
[02:08:09.086 --> 02:08:11.525]  Yet Biden, without hesitation, said, "I'm going to do it."
[02:08:11.548 --> 02:08:12.768]  Suddenly, he's Ronald Reagan.
[02:08:13.169 --> 02:08:14.189]  When have we seen this?
[02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:15.230]  I don't buy it.
[02:08:15.590 --> 02:08:18.212]  I think that there's a kabuki dance going on.
[02:08:18.772 --> 02:08:19.753]  The kabuki dance.
[02:08:19.893 --> 02:08:21.474]  I know what the end of it is.
[02:08:21.554 --> 02:08:24.015]  It's that Russia gets Ukraine and China gets Taiwan.
[02:08:24.035 --> 02:08:28.578]  I don't know all the steps, but I think that we're being walked through those steps.
[02:08:29.038 --> 02:08:35.745]   And, you know, the Chinese have a saying, like when you go to fight a superior Well, that's the next big question.
[02:08:35.765 --> 02:08:36.966]  I agree with that.
[02:08:37.066 --> 02:08:39.148]  And so does Steve Bannon and a lot of other people, Eric Prince, you name it.
[02:08:38.967 --> 02:08:42.087]   means like distract his attention get him involved in these other fights to
[02:08:42.087 --> 02:08:45.528]   weaken him so I think we're just being walked through a script and they want to
[02:08:45.528 --> 02:08:48.927]   get it done well that's the next big question I agree with that and so does
[02:08:48.927 --> 02:08:52.608]   Steve Bannon and a lot of other people Eric Prince you name it they were smart what
[02:08:52.608 --> 02:08:58.890]   comes next in Taiwan and the South China Sea and all of it What do you expect domestically?
[02:08:59.531 --> 02:09:01.493]  What do you expect with Trump and all these indictments?
[02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:03.055]  Patrick Byrne is our guest.
[02:09:03.816 --> 02:09:05.458]  You can go to DeepCapture.com.
[02:09:05.478 --> 02:09:09.183]  You can also find his magazine, Capital Times News, where he educates DC.
[02:09:09.884 --> 02:09:12.828]  We'll come right back to him and get his expertise on so many things.
[02:09:12.868 --> 02:09:15.412]  Really smart guy here with us today.
[02:09:15.432 --> 02:09:16.553]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:09:16.573 --> 02:09:20.679]  The websites are InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.
[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:23.964]  Those are the coordinates of Liberty and a real open discussion.
[02:09:24.384 --> 02:09:26.387]  We're at the geopolitical level here.
[02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:30.991]  It's captured in MSM dumbed-down narratives.
[02:09:31.011 --> 02:09:33.132]  We're having real adult discussions.
[02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:33.933]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:34.453 --> 02:09:41.056]  Patrick Byrne's a really smart guy, former CEO of Overstock, journalist, you name it, and he's laying out real facts here.
[02:09:41.076 --> 02:09:41.696]  So let's pull back.
[02:09:42.662 --> 02:10:01.012]  And I'm not in the business of demonizing the Rothschild family, but they famously funded both Napoleon and the British, and that's in the mainline history books, and they helped fund and create Israel today, and the Economist magazine they own is literally after it with the Kudnicks and Netanyahu and trying to keep judicial reform from passing.
[02:10:01.472 --> 02:10:04.774]  So let's just sit back and look at this and finish up with Israel and move on to other topics.
[02:10:06.055 --> 02:10:09.617]  But you could sit back, whoever blew up the hospital, okay?
[02:10:10.498 --> 02:10:17.042]  And see the corporate media run with that and push that when they haven't shown the war crimes on both sides in Ukraine, basically.
[02:10:17.663 --> 02:10:18.523]  What were they doing?
[02:10:18.943 --> 02:10:20.024]  Why were they doing that?
[02:10:20.384 --> 02:10:25.528]  To exacerbate, and the left allied with Hamas and all these violent demonstrations and things.
[02:10:25.548 --> 02:10:31.652]  So there's a larger dialectic, and you all know Harari coming out and saying Netanyahu is like Hitler.
[02:10:32.577 --> 02:10:33.740]  He's got to be gotten rid of.
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:36.084]  Well, Harari says the future is not human.
[02:10:36.726 --> 02:10:39.291]  So there's some larger internal battles going on here.
[02:10:39.331 --> 02:10:40.874]  But what is it meant to trigger?
[02:10:41.516 --> 02:10:42.458]  What is the trap?
[02:10:42.638 --> 02:10:43.680]  What would the globalist...
[02:10:44.833 --> 02:10:48.896]  Like to see happen here, because there's a larger goal.
[02:10:48.916 --> 02:10:52.258]  Patrick, what is the goal from the different factions?
[02:10:52.638 --> 02:10:58.761]  How does it tie into the $100 million that O'Biden is promising to give Ukraine and $15 million to Israel?
[02:10:59.182 --> 02:11:00.242]  Where do you see this going?
[02:11:00.523 --> 02:11:03.204]  Who's winning the fight from the factions right now?
[02:11:03.064 --> 02:11:06.503]  Now what's going to happen to the Yad Vashem?
[02:11:06.503 --> 02:11:13.823]   Well at the greatest level, the World Economic Forum, Davos, that crowd, is in fact trying
[02:11:13.823 --> 02:11:18.483]   to collapse the United States through a color revolution and integrate it into some European
[02:11:19.399 --> 02:11:20.860]  It's basically Nazi 2.0.
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.540]  We are facing Nazism 2.0.
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:25.521]  They learned this time, don't come at us with tanks and bullets.
[02:11:26.002 --> 02:11:29.223]  Come at us through a Beslanov-Syop.
[02:11:29.501 --> 02:11:33.661]   to take us over and so we're facing social stresses from that.
[02:11:33.661 --> 02:11:39.940]   In addition, another player is China and they want to create a Beijing,
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:45.340]   they want to create a Confucian world order, center of gravity Beijing with concentric circles around it
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:49.980]   and their definition of war is much more sophisticated than ours.
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:56.520]   It's not just with guns, it's diplomatic, it's economic, it's cultural
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:00.900]  and they've come at us in all these different ways at once.
[02:12:00.626 --> 02:12:01.787]  But we have a very good chance.
[02:12:02.587 --> 02:12:03.567]  Americans woke up.
[02:12:03.607 --> 02:12:05.608]  I think we woke up very quickly.
[02:12:06.108 --> 02:12:09.389]  Americans have to be reminded of a whole bunch of things about ourselves.
[02:12:09.409 --> 02:12:15.992]  They don't have to be re-educated, but they need to be reminded of what made America work and what we can do to get out of this.
[02:12:16.352 --> 02:12:17.752]  And it's really quite simple.
[02:12:20.393 --> 02:12:21.414]  That's the big picture.
[02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:29.504]  If you're talking about in Israel, you're talking about the factions in Israel, you have a faction that's basically some elitist snobs against a faction of people who are the deplorables.
[02:12:30.311 --> 02:12:55.745]  And those elitist snobs control the Supreme Court, and they want to, they look down their nose at the deplorables, who are both Ashkenazi and Sephardim, but the snobs are just Ashkenazi, and they look down their nose at them and say, well, you're a political process, this is your political process, but at the end of the day, whatever you pass, we get to review, and oh, we don't say, oh, that violates our, it doesn't, it gives us a bad feeling, so we cancel it.
[02:12:56.377 --> 02:13:00.140]  And there's no written constitution, so you can never really appeal to anything.
[02:13:00.321 --> 02:13:00.841]  It's crazy.
[02:13:01.121 --> 02:13:08.287]  So it's really, the factions are the snobs versus the deplorables in Israel, just like it is in the United States.
[02:13:08.307 --> 02:13:12.831]  Sure, and then globally, Trump wasn't even part of a faction, from my view.
[02:13:12.871 --> 02:13:20.078]  He was genuinely trying to be the president and bring peace and justice, and that's why he made, I think, a lot of, all the factions mad.
[02:13:22.188 --> 02:13:28.371]  Yeah, I don't think, I think President Trump had not yet internalized, nor had I, quite how bad D.C.
[02:13:28.411 --> 02:13:28.671]  was.
[02:13:28.711 --> 02:13:30.712]  Although he had never spent a night in D.C.
[02:13:31.113 --> 02:13:32.033]  He didn't understand.
[02:13:32.513 --> 02:13:38.616]  He thought once the campaign was over and he got there, everyone put aside what happened and we got back to the business of building America together.
[02:13:38.656 --> 02:13:39.957]  And he tried to power share.
[02:13:39.977 --> 02:13:42.999]  He tried to power share and say, we'll make everybody more prosperous.
[02:13:43.019 --> 02:13:48.601]  It's like when he went to Kim Jong-un and said, let's build hotels and casinos and free your people.
[02:13:48.982 --> 02:13:51.063]  Sorry, the Chi-Coms run North Korea.
[02:13:51.083 --> 02:13:51.643]  They wouldn't let him.
[02:13:53.547 --> 02:13:59.932]  Yeah, well, and he didn't have, Obama left like 106 people across the National Security Council.
[02:14:00.252 --> 02:14:02.854]  He turned into civil servants just before he left.
[02:14:03.495 --> 02:14:04.496]  And they were just left there.
[02:14:04.676 --> 02:14:10.580]  And I don't think Trump cared, or I don't know if he knew, but he didn't care, didn't understand that personnel is policy.
[02:14:11.121 --> 02:14:18.466]   And so he had these people from the beginning who wanted They hated him so much, they forgot the job was to work together and build America.
[02:14:18.706 --> 02:14:23.709]  And I think that there's a... Who's that couple we've discussed before?
[02:14:23.749 --> 02:14:25.170]  Those sociologists from New York?
[02:14:28.214 --> 02:14:29.075]  Yeah, Howard Piven.
[02:14:29.636 --> 02:14:31.636]  I think it's that strategy. We're coming to the area.
[02:14:31.636 --> 02:14:33.636]  You're going to wreck the system to build on it.
[02:14:33.636 --> 02:14:37.636]   So let's finish up with the Middle East and Ukraine. It's all tied together.
[02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:41.636]   What are the different permutations? What are you predicting is going to happen?
[02:14:41.636 --> 02:14:44.636]  Does Netanyahu survive? How big is the war going to get?
[02:14:44.636 --> 02:14:46.636]  They're sending U.S. troops all the Middle East.
[02:14:46.636 --> 02:14:49.636]  They're sending anti-missile systems in. It looks bad.
[02:14:49.636 --> 02:14:52.636]  Well, I want to defend Israel.
[02:14:52.952 --> 02:14:55.252]  With missile systems, that is great.
[02:14:55.392 --> 02:14:56.233]  I would do anything.
[02:14:57.313 --> 02:15:02.935]  Just remember, from the InfoWars point of view, the people calling the shots aren't in Qatar.
[02:15:02.955 --> 02:15:05.355]  The people calling the shots are in Iran or in China.
[02:15:05.835 --> 02:15:09.216]  And this has been set up for us to do just what we're doing now.
[02:15:09.336 --> 02:15:14.598]  So just be aware, whatever we're doing, they've already anticipated it, and it's just what they want us to do.
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:17.583]  They did this wanting Israel to respond.
[02:15:17.603 --> 02:15:23.269]  They wanted it so bad, they created a stunt that there's no way Israel can't support it.
[02:15:23.309 --> 02:15:28.355]  Yeah, that's why they had the hang gliders, all of it, was just to make Israel look weak so Israel would have a response.
[02:15:30.266 --> 02:15:34.768]  And we can't but be drawn into it, and I don't trust the fact that Biden's going into it.
[02:15:34.868 --> 02:15:41.590]  I think Biden's orders from his handlers may be decisions that are really all about getting us beat at the end.
[02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:45.952]  You know how Germany fought Russia at the end as Germany was collapsing in World War II?
[02:15:45.992 --> 02:15:47.753]  Have you ever heard of the Hammer and Anvil strategy?
[02:15:47.773 --> 02:15:48.373]  Yeah, display it.
[02:15:49.744 --> 02:15:53.947]  Yeah, they built basically anvils, metaphorically speaking.
[02:15:54.907 --> 02:16:00.091]  Concentrations of troops, and they used their other troops just to guide the Russians as they advanced.
[02:16:00.431 --> 02:16:04.413]  So they had a very easy path, and then they got to this anvil, so to speak.
[02:16:04.433 --> 02:16:07.535]  Heavily artillery-covered areas.
[02:16:08.336 --> 02:16:11.898]  And I have this feeling that that's what China has laid out for us.
[02:16:11.918 --> 02:16:14.820]  A whole bunch of corridors for us to go down.
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:16.161]  And Ukraine is one of them.
[02:16:16.281 --> 02:16:18.242]  Ukraine is the most avoidable war of our lifetime.
[02:16:18.422 --> 02:16:19.103]  It's ridiculous.
[02:16:19.523 --> 02:16:24.369]  Should have just had it work on the deal with it not being part of NATO for 20 years.
[02:16:24.449 --> 02:16:25.310]  It's the silliest thing ever.
[02:16:25.691 --> 02:16:36.785]  I was raised by Hawks Hawks from the Reagan era and this General Jack Vesey, Reagan's Joint Chiefs, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and he thought it was ridiculous, as did Kissinger and George Shultz.
[02:16:37.185 --> 02:16:39.126]  That we would ever start World War 3 over Ukraine.
[02:16:39.207 --> 02:16:42.049]  Ukraine should just be Finland, is what they were saying in 2015.
[02:16:42.769 --> 02:16:46.572]  This was so avoidable, but we are being walked into these disasters.
[02:16:46.612 --> 02:16:47.592]  I think this is the next disaster.
[02:16:47.612 --> 02:16:53.977]  I was about to say, is that because Biden and his controllers and Obama want to destroy America, and they're working with the CHICOMs because U.S.
[02:16:54.017 --> 02:16:57.900]  policy, even Biden said in December, we can't send tanks, F-16s, and cruise missiles.
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.784]  That's World War 3, but now they've decided to ignore all the doctrine that was well thought out, even by the RAND Corporation.
[02:17:04.524 --> 02:17:05.565]  Yeah.
[02:17:05.605 --> 02:17:26.599]   So I'm all on with supplying Israel, giving them diplomatic support, and giving them cover, but I would also be doing everything I could to defuse it, because It's going to be a tremendous loss at the dimension of information war for not just them, but for us.
[02:17:26.679 --> 02:17:34.704]  I think it's going to cleave the world, and we'll be stuck out with the Europeans, and we'll have lost everything we've built since World War II, although we've just about lost it already.
[02:17:35.845 --> 02:17:38.507]  All right, let's talk about the domestic situation.
[02:17:38.547 --> 02:17:40.288]  The indictments of turbocharged Trump.
[02:17:41.108 --> 02:17:43.650]  It's the immovable force, unstoppable object.
[02:17:45.754 --> 02:17:51.977]  Clearly, the Feds are saying Trump supporters are about to kill everybody, terrorism, they're hyping all this up.
[02:17:53.157 --> 02:17:55.478]  What do you think about the election 12 months away?
[02:17:57.399 --> 02:17:59.640]  First of all, I'll say I was literally in the room.
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:01.941]  There was nothing inappropriate.
[02:18:02.021 --> 02:18:03.502]  Everyone conducted themselves.
[02:18:03.622 --> 02:18:05.083]  Everyone knew what we were in the middle of.
[02:18:05.863 --> 02:18:08.484]  Everyone conducted themselves like it was being videotaped.
[02:18:09.044 --> 02:18:12.266]  For those that don't know, you were in the room when they were challenging the election.
[02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:17.327]  Well, when we were discussing in the Oval Office was one room I was in.
[02:18:17.367 --> 02:18:30.751]  I was also in the room when the Senate and the House sent representatives over, including a couple senators and members of the House, to be briefed a couple days before January 6th and to be briefed on what we had and what they thought.
[02:18:31.171 --> 02:18:36.072]  And they were going directly back to brief the Senate and the House and the White House.
[02:18:36.172 --> 02:18:38.173]  And Mike Pence had his own person.
[02:18:38.923 --> 02:18:41.548]  I don't know what was said and what wasn't said.
[02:18:41.608 --> 02:18:43.091]  There was no insurrection plan.
[02:18:43.131 --> 02:18:45.876]  There was no color revolution plan.
[02:18:45.896 --> 02:18:46.998]  That's not what this was about.
[02:18:47.379 --> 02:18:59.717]   It was a perfectly legitimate strategy to ask that You know, it's there's provided for within the law for members of the House and Senate to object to recognizing electoral ballots from a certain state.
[02:18:59.737 --> 02:19:03.742]  There's a certain they get an hour to debate and this and that they do it several times.
[02:19:04.323 --> 02:19:08.989]  There is absolute provision that allows them to say, let's send this back to the state for a week.
[02:19:09.839 --> 02:19:19.727]  And if they had done that, and the states had re had looked at, you know, every state could have done just what Arizona did in theirs, have a quick two or three days of hearings, have different witnesses say their speech.
[02:19:20.267 --> 02:19:25.431]  And then the legislature votes again, and recommits their electoral ballots.
[02:19:25.851 --> 02:19:29.574]  And there were there were legislators from five states who had written and asked for that.
[02:19:29.855 --> 02:19:39.322]  There was nothing inappropriate about suggesting that it's ridiculous, even that they're trying to disbar lawyers who followed that, you know, that's part that's provided for in the law.
[02:19:39.862 --> 02:19:45.250]  So it's just it's just it's lawfare that crosses the boundaries into sedition.
[02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:47.933]  They're trying to execute the revolution through lawfare.
[02:19:48.594 --> 02:19:51.118]  I'm the guy who I wish they would come through me first.
[02:19:51.598 --> 02:19:52.359]  I vouch for it.
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:55.704]  I told everybody, you know, I convinced everybody.
[02:19:57.386 --> 02:20:00.168]  And yet, they won't mention me, they won't mention my name.
[02:20:00.248 --> 02:20:01.569]  Have you noticed this?
[02:20:01.689 --> 02:20:03.890]  I've offered to take the charges for everyone.
[02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:09.614]  No, no, you were saying this two and a half years ago, you were saying it three months ago, and they will not say your name.
[02:20:10.134 --> 02:20:14.517]  And you're publishing magazines and handing them out over D.C., you know, trying to inform people.
[02:20:14.678 --> 02:20:17.960]  So, gut level, how do you see this playing out?
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:23.744]  Because America sees through what they're doing to Trump, but they just seem to be just barreling forward with this.
[02:20:25.586 --> 02:20:32.492]  I think that they don't want to, of course, they don't want there to be an election.
[02:20:32.552 --> 02:20:33.813]  They want to skip the election.
[02:20:34.774 --> 02:20:37.877]  And they're going to play it out as long as they can.
[02:20:37.917 --> 02:20:40.319]  But if they think they're going to lose, they're going to try to skip the election.
[02:20:44.096 --> 02:20:47.920]  So I think that's what it comes down to, even if it means starting a nuclear war.
[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:48.781]  By the way, I agree with you.
[02:20:48.801 --> 02:20:50.002]  I was about to say, so how do they do it?
[02:20:50.423 --> 02:20:51.264]  Nuclear war?
[02:20:51.784 --> 02:20:52.685]  Power outages?
[02:20:52.725 --> 02:20:56.209]  They're saying patriots will work with Putin to cyber-cut the power?
[02:20:56.269 --> 02:20:57.310]  The FBI put that out?
[02:20:57.710 --> 02:21:03.016]  I mean, they're clearly laying out the pretext for some huge crisis.
[02:21:05.151 --> 02:21:19.496]  Yeah, and it's anything they can do to prevent there from being an election because they don't want to face the consequences, which is why I'm like, I think the only guy on our side always emphasizing it's not too late to get through this with peace, truth and reconciliation.
[02:21:20.083 --> 02:21:21.204]  Truth and reconciliation.
[02:21:21.244 --> 02:21:34.239]  Now, I know that makes guys like you vomit, but if you could get through this now without a single person being hung or tried or going to prison, but we could return to getting out from under the thumb of this coup, is that a deal you would take?
[02:21:34.759 --> 02:21:35.801]  Well, Patrick, let's be clear.
[02:21:37.285 --> 02:21:38.586]  I don't want to... I don't know.
[02:21:38.826 --> 02:21:45.991]  I believed sending Napoleon the first time to an island was good, and the second time that made him give up, so I totally agree.
[02:21:46.111 --> 02:21:53.276]  I would rather have the globalists back off because even if they try this martial law thing, that will probably destroy them and us along with them.
[02:21:53.557 --> 02:21:54.617]  So you got the wrong guy.
[02:21:54.717 --> 02:21:58.420]  I'm not the guy that wants to saddle up and have a civil war physically 2.0.
[02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:05.545]  I'm all about actually getting the establishment to realize how insane they are, but they want the physical confrontation.
[02:22:06.795 --> 02:22:14.298]  They want it because they don't understand that what happens if it comes, 90% of us die in the first year just from supply chain collapse.
[02:22:14.498 --> 02:22:16.339]  That's book one second answer.
[02:22:16.359 --> 02:22:16.939]  That's right.
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:22.702]  We had like 10 million people, universities estimate, starved to death during the Great Depression in the 1920s.
[02:22:22.782 --> 02:22:26.624]  We were 90% rural, about half sufficient.
[02:22:27.064 --> 02:22:30.105]  Now we're 90% urban, maybe 5% sufficient.
[02:22:32.026 --> 02:22:53.079]   Most estimates, you're right, is 90% die in a real And then, so it's one year, because you also have pharmaceutical collapse and fuel collapse, and within one year, 90% die.
[02:22:53.259 --> 02:22:59.804]  In the meantime, the cartels are given free reign, loot, pillage, rape, burn, destroy America.
[02:23:00.104 --> 02:23:04.087]  After three years of it, they get given the signal, they withdraw, China colonizes.
[02:23:04.387 --> 02:23:05.768]  This is all in their national security.
[02:23:05.868 --> 02:23:07.629]  The plan by the W.E.F.
[02:23:07.649 --> 02:23:14.913]  and the globalists is collapse America financially, have a race war, have things break down, let the criminals run wild, and then bring in the U.N.
[02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:15.614]  forces later.
[02:23:16.294 --> 02:23:17.255]  That's why I said five years.
[02:23:17.535 --> 02:23:20.276]  I think when the cartels and the U.N.
[02:23:20.316 --> 02:23:23.073]   forces show up, They, the U.N.
[02:23:23.113 --> 02:23:27.935]  forces are, you know what, I'm sure you know what the Blue Helmets do in Africa and everywhere they're sent.
[02:23:28.256 --> 02:23:31.097]  They're always involved in kiddie rape stuff.
[02:23:31.257 --> 02:23:32.678]  Oh, for those that don't know, the U.N.
[02:23:32.778 --> 02:23:35.800]  Army is the thickest concentration of pedophiles.
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.102]  They suppress it now, but it used to be all over the news until 10 years ago.
[02:23:39.422 --> 02:23:42.824]  The U.N., they join it to rape children and to traffic them.
[02:23:44.173 --> 02:23:51.155]  Right, there's candy, sex for candy, it used to be what it was called, all these sex for candy scandals around Africa.
[02:23:52.755 --> 02:23:54.316]  And Cambodia and places like that.
[02:23:54.716 --> 02:23:59.917]  So yeah, you'd have that, and when there's nothing left but a carcass, it gets surrendered to China.
[02:23:59.977 --> 02:24:03.458]  And this is in, do you know the secret speech of Cher Haotian?
[02:24:04.278 --> 02:24:07.459]  Have you heard this Chinese general, his retirement speech, he laid this all out?
[02:24:07.899 --> 02:24:08.819]  Ever read that one Alex?
[02:24:08.839 --> 02:24:09.239]  Yes I have.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:11.640]  Tell folks about it.
[02:24:13.266 --> 02:24:15.047]  Well, this is what they say.
[02:24:15.067 --> 02:24:17.548]  I mean, it's not mad conspiracy theory.
[02:24:17.608 --> 02:24:23.930]  No, they said our degeneracy and their control of Hollywood, four of the six Hollywood production companies are owned by them.
[02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:27.371]  They ban all this propaganda there because it destroys the civilization.
[02:24:27.871 --> 02:24:34.774]  Literally, the chi-coms are, with the left, literally fire-hosing us with civilization-destroying propaganda.
[02:24:36.297 --> 02:24:43.926]  Yeah, and the left, the hard left, is basically like in the days of Athens, there was the period of the age of the 30 tyrants.
[02:24:44.466 --> 02:25:06.397]   When Sparta finally beat Athens, there were some 30 Elders in Athens who said don't colonize us instead just appoint us in charge We never liked that democracy crap anyway, but ours in charge We'll just run this as a dictatorship and Spartan and those 30 Athenians cooperated became the dictators that ran Athens it only worked for eight months, but the point is they
[02:25:07.469 --> 02:25:10.093]  I think that our hard core left elites... Trump talked about that.
[02:25:10.113 --> 02:25:17.322]  He said it's the middlemen that are managing things with China in our decline that literally get more money than the Chai comms do.
[02:25:17.362 --> 02:25:23.090]  So they're making billions a piece on selling us out and don't they know as soon as the Chai comms take us over, they're all dead.
[02:25:25.185 --> 02:25:26.506]  Yeah, they don't understand.
[02:25:26.527 --> 02:25:31.552]  Look, they should look up what happened to the Viet Cong after as soon as Saigon fell and the NBA took it.
[02:25:32.033 --> 02:25:36.397]  After wiping out the class that worked with America, they wiped out the Viet Cong.
[02:25:36.738 --> 02:25:38.680]  They didn't want any competing power structure.
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:39.981]  There's no place for those kind of people.
[02:25:40.021 --> 02:25:44.086]  They detest those kinds of bites or what the white lefties they call them.
[02:25:45.191 --> 02:25:46.552]  You damn well, you know what you're doing.
[02:25:46.572 --> 02:25:51.915]  They always kill the revolutionaries that lower the drawbridge, because you don't want people around that lower the drawbridge.
[02:25:52.215 --> 02:26:00.861]  That's kind of like when the Sultan took over Constantinople, and he called in the traders that had helped him bring down the city, and he ordered them executed.
[02:26:00.901 --> 02:26:02.302]  They said, sir, we worked.
[02:26:02.342 --> 02:26:05.844]  He said, yeah, you think I want you around now that you betrayed your own people?
[02:26:06.304 --> 02:26:06.884]  Execute them.
[02:26:08.585 --> 02:26:12.268]  The only ones you would respect are the ones that fought for their country, you know?
[02:26:13.004 --> 02:26:14.165]  So what else is on your radar?
[02:26:14.185 --> 02:26:15.025]  You're really smart.
[02:26:15.065 --> 02:26:15.626]  We love you.
[02:26:15.986 --> 02:26:18.127]  We got about 6-7 minutes left.
[02:26:18.167 --> 02:26:20.029]  What else do you want to impart to folks, Patrick Byrne?
[02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:29.535]  I can tell you that there is a very massive thing coming next week.
[02:26:29.555 --> 02:26:33.777]  A court filing that will have you talking, will have you excited, Alex.
[02:26:33.837 --> 02:26:42.083]  We have them on several fronts, but these are really no-goodniks, and you're going to see a massive court filing next week.
[02:26:43.558 --> 02:26:47.941]  And we have them, they're so corrupt, and we have found, we are exposing their corruption.
[02:26:48.521 --> 02:26:57.828]  Well you were on two and a half years ago when they stole the election, three years ago, and you said, the whole big tech's gonna come out, they're all gonna get exposed, we're gonna have the hearings, that's happened, what comes next?
[02:27:00.750 --> 02:27:03.092]  Well, what do you think of this Mike Johnson character?
[02:27:03.132 --> 02:27:05.414]  I didn't know, I think, what do you think of him?
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.161]  I did a lot of studying yesterday and today.
[02:27:08.201 --> 02:27:08.962]  I knew who he was.
[02:27:09.002 --> 02:27:11.443]  He says a lot of good stuff, does some bad stuff.
[02:27:12.264 --> 02:27:13.324]  I think the jury's out.
[02:27:13.364 --> 02:27:13.725]  I don't know.
[02:27:13.745 --> 02:27:14.225]  What's your view?
[02:27:15.706 --> 02:27:17.087]  You don't grade on a curve, do you?
[02:27:17.427 --> 02:27:20.308]  I'm sure you can find in any history of these guys, you can find something you don't like.
[02:27:20.749 --> 02:27:21.229]  I like him.
[02:27:21.249 --> 02:27:29.334]  The fact that, you know, a British philosopher, Isaiah Berlin, said, the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.
[02:27:30.493 --> 02:27:34.895]  The big thing that matters to know is that Washington D.C.
[02:27:34.955 --> 02:27:38.656]  is corrupt, a unit party swamp has taken over, the election is rigged.
[02:27:39.636 --> 02:27:41.597]  Understanding that is all that matters.
[02:27:41.717 --> 02:27:48.219]  I'll take a guy who understands that and says that, and we can fight about tax policy or whatever the other things you don't like.
[02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:51.681]  He is exposing the censorship and the FBI censorship and the control.
[02:27:51.741 --> 02:27:52.701]  I've seen him doing that.
[02:27:54.366 --> 02:27:57.709]  Yeah, well at this point I don't care about anything else.
[02:27:57.729 --> 02:28:00.231]  How was he able to get a consensus though?
[02:28:02.754 --> 02:28:03.374]  How was he?
[02:28:03.394 --> 02:28:04.015]  Yeah.
[02:28:05.336 --> 02:28:06.657]  Part of it was personality.
[02:28:07.197 --> 02:28:08.398]  Because I think that the...
[02:28:09.733 --> 02:28:12.997]  What's the Freedom Caucus, although I know he's not officially in the Freedom Caucus.
[02:28:13.677 --> 02:28:25.670]  I know that the Freedom Caucus is correct about things, but they are looked at as so... They're looked at like you and I are looked at, Alex, and they're for mainstream people, including mainstream Congress.
[02:28:25.690 --> 02:28:27.132]  They can't just bring themselves...
[02:28:27.812 --> 02:28:36.937]  Well yeah, they've been battle-scarred saving the country, and so even though we've converted other congressmen to now follow the same directive, they've had fights with the establishment.
[02:28:36.957 --> 02:28:41.780]  The establishment won't share power with them, but the next wave, even though they're agreeing with the Freedom Caucus, can be brought in.
[02:28:43.578 --> 02:28:49.543]  Yeah, and give them a nice button-down, mild guy who says the same thing, they can start hearing it.
[02:28:50.103 --> 02:28:53.185]  And they hear it, and they know it's right.
[02:28:53.206 --> 02:28:57.889]  They'll take it from this Mike Johnson that they don't take from us.
[02:28:58.029 --> 02:29:04.314]  His personality's different, his actions are more like them, and they're able to hear him better.
[02:29:04.795 --> 02:29:09.098]  How interesting that he was able to get unanimity so quickly.
[02:29:10.167 --> 02:29:11.109]  I think it's great, actually.
[02:29:11.149 --> 02:29:12.050]  I think he's going to surprise us.
[02:29:12.090 --> 02:29:14.232]  Well, he's better than the guy they had before.
[02:29:14.252 --> 02:29:16.034]  The last guy was George Soros' spokesman.
[02:29:19.058 --> 02:29:20.439]  Remember, they tried that other Congressman.
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:22.602]  His name will pop in a minute.
[02:29:23.543 --> 02:29:24.223]  The hammer?
[02:29:24.444 --> 02:29:24.964]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:26.806 --> 02:29:28.709]  Yeah, all of this is going to be over soon.
[02:29:28.789 --> 02:29:30.551]  Actually, with a good guy, we could...
[02:29:31.443 --> 02:29:34.884]  We could, we could, this could be over in weeks with a good guy there.
[02:29:34.924 --> 02:29:37.486]  I wish that they would hire Mike Flynn to be the head of the U.S.
[02:29:37.506 --> 02:29:46.709]  Capitol Police, because Nancy Pelosi got in a $400.5 billion budget and the right to inspect elections and be involved in election security.
[02:29:46.749 --> 02:29:50.911]  Well, I'd love to have, with somebody honest running it, I'd love to have the U.S.
[02:29:50.951 --> 02:29:51.671]  Capitol Police.
[02:29:51.971 --> 02:29:55.653]  Mike Flynn, if he were in charge of that, he could, in 30 days, we'd be out of this mess.
[02:29:55.693 --> 02:29:55.893]  No, I agree.
[02:29:55.913 --> 02:29:57.954]  Let me ask you this, Patrick, but in closing, we have a minute and a half.
[02:29:59.059 --> 02:29:59.599]  Gut level.
[02:29:59.639 --> 02:30:01.400]  I know you're not a prophet, but I respect your view.
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:03.201]  Can Trump survive this?
[02:30:03.221 --> 02:30:07.163]  I mean, you know he's going to win, but they will steal it again with all the different same methods.
[02:30:07.703 --> 02:30:08.684]  What's going to happen to Trump?
[02:30:10.765 --> 02:30:15.487]  He's, he's, I think that part of the case against him is about to be blown up.
[02:30:15.987 --> 02:30:19.109]  Part of, one of his cases against him is about to be blown up.
[02:30:19.609 --> 02:30:21.590]  I think that he's got, he's on a roll.
[02:30:21.810 --> 02:30:23.911]  I actually feel better and better about him.
[02:30:24.933 --> 02:30:31.998]  And I do worry that he gets sick or poisoned or hurt, because what happens to the movement then?
[02:30:33.299 --> 02:30:33.759]  I agree.
[02:30:33.859 --> 02:30:43.866]  I mean, look, presidents have secret service for a reason, but I don't think anybody in modern history has been more targeted, and the deep state keeps failing to remove him with all their theater and all their lawfare.
[02:30:45.206 --> 02:30:46.567]  What happens if they do kill Trump?
[02:30:46.587 --> 02:30:47.368]  That's another question.
[02:30:48.726 --> 02:30:49.467]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:30:49.667 --> 02:30:51.209]  Just, you know, the guy's 75, 6.
[02:30:51.849 --> 02:30:53.851]  A guy could keel over.
[02:30:53.871 --> 02:30:54.752]  He's under a lot of pressure.
[02:30:55.053 --> 02:30:55.974]  What happens then?
[02:30:57.235 --> 02:30:58.176]  All right, Patrick Byrne.
[02:30:58.216 --> 02:30:58.796]  I did see it.
[02:30:59.117 --> 02:30:59.277]  But?
[02:31:00.779 --> 02:31:02.861]  He'd lost 50 pounds, so he looks much better.
[02:31:02.921 --> 02:31:04.322]  So he's not going to keel over, I think.
[02:31:05.103 --> 02:31:06.084]  No, he's strong.
[02:31:06.244 --> 02:31:06.564]  All right.
[02:31:06.625 --> 02:31:07.465]  Thank you, Patrick Byrne.
[02:31:07.485 --> 02:31:07.846]  Amazing.
[02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:10.590]  Take care, Alex.
[02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:11.590]  All right.
[02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:14.590]   The great Royce White takes over for an hour and then Owen Schreuer takes over.
[02:31:14.590 --> 02:31:15.590]  Oh, sorry.
[02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:17.429]  He's in federal prison for his speech.
[02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:22.750]   So be sure and tune in today and pray for Owen while he's in prison.
[02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:27.549]   As soon as he's able to call out a recorded interview, we're going to get Owen on the
[02:31:27.549 --> 02:31:31.069]  show and we're all praying for Owen and appreciate Owen.
[02:31:31.069 --> 02:31:34.210]   But without InfoWars, we're not going to have a platform to defend Owen.
[02:31:34.210 --> 02:31:37.149]  So I hope that everybody will go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:34:49.529 --> 02:34:52.993]  But it's the mental clarity, it's the mental energy, it's the focus factor.
[02:34:53.113 --> 02:35:00.440]  This is a natural way to get mental focus, mental clarity, mental energy without having to go to a big pharmaceutical product.
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.202]  Hello boys and girls.
[02:35:02.021 --> 02:35:09.021]   happening. 60% off. Let's get to Infobarestore.com and fund this operation today.
[02:35:09.021 --> 02:35:16.021]   Hello, boys and girls. I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[02:35:16.021 --> 02:35:24.621]   In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[02:35:24.621 --> 02:35:30.621]   whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:35:30.928 --> 02:35:40.131]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:47.957]  This is Warren Grongeit in our newsroom, and there has been an attempt, as perhaps you know now, on the life of President Kennedy.
[02:35:48.158 --> 02:35:53.423]  The initial attack on the destroyer Maddox on August 2nd was repeated today.
[02:35:55.605 --> 02:35:58.267]  Psychological warfare operations went into high gear.
[02:36:01.447 --> 02:36:10.857]  In retaliation for this unprovoked attack on the high seas, our forces have struck the bases used by the North Vietnamese patrol craft.
[02:36:10.897 --> 02:36:14.097]  It would allow the president to wage war in Vietnam.
[02:36:14.097 --> 02:36:17.537]  [Music]
[02:36:17.537 --> 02:36:18.537]  [Gunshot]
[02:36:18.537 --> 02:36:21.537]  [Gunshots]
[02:36:21.537 --> 02:36:25.097]  [Music]
[02:36:25.097 --> 02:36:29.096]  Just run and escape.
[02:36:29.096 --> 02:36:30.897]  [Music]
[02:36:30.897 --> 02:36:38.297]   In 1976, Flight 455, which took off from Venezuela, bound for Cuba, suddenly exploded.
[02:36:38.278 --> 02:36:45.278]   All 73 passengers and 5 crew members aboard died after the plane crashed near Barclay.
[02:36:45.278 --> 02:36:56.038]  William Colby has been missing since April 27.
[02:36:56.065 --> 02:37:00.351]  His canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Wicomico River April 28.
[02:37:04.085 --> 02:37:05.526]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[02:37:05.606 --> 02:37:07.507]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[02:37:07.647 --> 02:37:15.512]  I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:37:20.235 --> 02:37:22.557]  All right, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[02:37:23.498 --> 02:37:26.741]  It's an organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[02:37:26.761 --> 02:37:45.457]  What they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country, to work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and, in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[02:37:45.577 --> 02:37:48.059]  I understand he was tapped for skull and bones.
[02:37:48.779 --> 02:37:49.680]  Tap for it.
[02:37:50.220 --> 02:37:52.702]  Sir, he found it, skull and bones.
[02:37:52.722 --> 02:37:55.804]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[02:37:56.204 --> 02:38:03.089]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[02:38:03.129 --> 02:38:07.492]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[02:38:07.692 --> 02:38:08.512]  Just leave us alone.
[02:38:08.753 --> 02:38:10.074]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[02:38:10.994 --> 02:38:12.015]  I want you to get mad.
[02:38:12.375 --> 02:38:14.076]  We have got to fight stand-up!
[02:38:14.297 --> 02:38:15.658]  It's not gonna be easy!
[02:38:15.738 --> 02:38:16.959]  But I'll tell you this!
[02:38:17.279 --> 02:38:20.822]  We can, and we will, and we must prevail!
[02:38:21.762 --> 02:38:28.762]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:38:28.762 --> 02:38:42.762]   Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the
[02:38:42.762 --> 02:38:45.362]  left doesn't like, at least in government.
[02:38:45.556 --> 02:38:51.262]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[02:38:51.342 --> 02:38:53.504]  The left have wised up to this.
[02:38:53.705 --> 02:38:59.090]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[02:38:59.110 --> 02:39:00.191]  The social media giants.
[02:39:00.451 --> 02:39:00.832]  And they are.
[02:39:01.192 --> 02:39:06.814]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[02:39:06.914 --> 02:39:11.615]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[02:39:11.736 --> 02:39:19.438]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[02:39:19.498 --> 02:39:25.320]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:28.401]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:39:28.641 --> 02:39:32.243]  But this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[02:39:32.623 --> 02:39:42.469]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:44.290]  People know what's true.
[02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:45.311]  They can smell it.
[02:39:45.871 --> 02:39:50.754]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:39:51.274 --> 02:39:53.296]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[02:39:53.115 --> 02:39:57.115]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[02:39:57.115 --> 02:40:09.446]   Good afternoon. I'm- I am your guest host for the hour.
[02:40:09.886 --> 02:40:13.449]  My name is Royce White here from the belly of the beast in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[02:40:14.829 --> 02:40:19.252]  Great to be back on InfoWars again, this most historic and legendary platform.
[02:40:19.272 --> 02:40:23.595]  I want to say thank you to Alex Jones for allowing me to host this hour.
[02:40:25.096 --> 02:40:31.119]  My thoughts and prayers are with the great Owen Troyer, victim of kangaroo courts.
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:34.001]  Now we hear being held in solitary confinement.
[02:40:34.921 --> 02:40:36.002]  Which shouldn't shock any of us.
[02:40:36.442 --> 02:40:37.483]  Very hard thing to deal with.
[02:40:38.644 --> 02:40:40.985]  We're really living in times of all-out tyranny.
[02:40:43.087 --> 02:40:59.698]  And I don't have to tell this audience, but many times what will happen when I'm on InfoWars is your mainstream, your liberal mainstream media industrial complex will use it as evidence to the fact that I'm a conspiracy theorist or, you know, darling of the dangerous far and alt-right.
[02:41:01.300 --> 02:41:09.805]  So there's a chance that what we say here reaches people who are either in the middle or even on the complete other side than we are.
[02:41:11.526 --> 02:41:18.990]  I've been listening to Alex Jones and Infowars for the better part of 15 to, you know, 15 years, 20 years.
[02:41:20.390 --> 02:41:23.112]  Ever since I was probably about 15 years old, so I'd say about 17 years.
[02:41:26.152 --> 02:41:36.775]  And they'll use that as a reason to disqualify me from my senatorial race here in the 24-hour election cycle in Minnesota against Amy Klobuchar.
[02:41:37.575 --> 02:41:42.736]  And if you want, my Senate website will be up in the weeks and days to come, so check back.
[02:41:42.796 --> 02:41:46.037]  It's not up right now, but you can go and make donations and so on and so forth.
[02:41:46.097 --> 02:41:51.418]  But they'll use my being on the show as a disqualifier to be a United States Senator.
[02:41:52.683 --> 02:42:01.525]  And that's why I talk forthright not only to this audience, but I talk about things in terms of whoever may be hearing it anywhere in the world.
[02:42:02.406 --> 02:42:10.668]  Because we are at that moment in world history, and in the history of this country, but in the history of the world, and America is the bastion of freedom all around the world.
[02:42:10.728 --> 02:42:16.029]  We are the last bastion of freedom, the only real and true bastion of freedom.
[02:42:16.049 --> 02:42:22.301]   Not to say they don't have freedom in other countries, or they're not prioritizing freedom in other countries, but But America is is a unique.
[02:42:24.402 --> 02:42:26.223]  A unique nation to say the very least.
[02:42:27.664 --> 02:42:28.685]  And I think.
[02:42:31.366 --> 02:42:38.631]  What Alex Jones is predicted has never been more true than right now, there's never been a time in my lifetime that was that was more.
[02:42:41.592 --> 02:42:46.855]  Evidence proof that Alex Jones was was right in what we're living in right now.
[02:42:48.056 --> 02:42:49.277]  Whether it's kangaroo courts.
[02:42:50.447 --> 02:42:58.493]  Lawfare, weaponized, political, politicized, weaponized, judiciaries, DAs, judges.
[02:43:00.254 --> 02:43:04.037]  We're living in a sort of kangaroo court, banana republic.
[02:43:05.598 --> 02:43:18.207]  And I think I wrote a letter when Alex Jones was going through, still is going through, but when Alex Jones was first brought up on charges and sued, I said that this was going to be the start of the end.
[02:43:19.117 --> 02:43:28.123]  And shortly, you know, after it was Steve and then, you know, then it was Donald Trump in the crosshairs of lawfare, Owen Schroer, and and the list is just going to continue to grow.
[02:43:28.984 --> 02:43:35.128]  And we all have to make a decision at some point about how the country either burns or is saved.
[02:43:36.509 --> 02:43:42.173]  And in part of saving that republic, part of saving the country, part of preserving freedom is understanding what the danger and threat is.
[02:43:42.213 --> 02:43:48.557]  And Alex Jones has done a better job than anybody in communicating and articulating what that danger is.
[02:43:49.507 --> 02:43:53.868]  And we're seeing it now, and I like to start from the most, this is just me.
[02:43:54.108 --> 02:43:58.909]  You know, as somebody who formerly suffered from anxiety disorder, this is just me.
[02:44:00.009 --> 02:44:01.149]  And I think it's prudent.
[02:44:01.649 --> 02:44:08.350]  I think our founding fathers had a similar view of the construction of government in our founding documents.
[02:44:08.890 --> 02:44:13.951]  They started from the worst case scenario and they worked their way back to hoping for the best.
[02:44:15.952 --> 02:44:18.412]  We prepare for the worst, but we hope for the best.
[02:44:19.316 --> 02:44:23.300]  And that's kind of how our system of governance was constructed as well.
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:30.926]  And so, starting from the worst case scenario, what should we be concerned about?
[02:44:30.966 --> 02:44:32.047]  What should we be worried about?
[02:44:32.067 --> 02:44:33.068]  What are the real dangers?
[02:44:33.208 --> 02:44:34.088]  What are the real threats?
[02:44:35.369 --> 02:44:53.856]   Now, some would wake up today and try and politicize and use the mass shootings in Maine as a pretext to To say that the Second Amendment is what you should be worried about and crazies with guns, gun nuts, people who are carrying firearms are what you should worry about.
[02:44:53.896 --> 02:45:03.640]  And you may, you know, go to your local watering hole or the mall near you and be shot and killed in some volley of random terroristic gunfire.
[02:45:05.395 --> 02:45:17.281]  And those people, those people that would promote that, those people that would try and keep the scope of your political worldview in that area, in that vector, those are the very people who have the most dangerous and pernicious thing planned for you.
[02:45:18.061 --> 02:45:33.028]  And the most dangerous and pernicious thing planned for you is that you beg for the expansion of government, that you beg for the expansion of the federal government, that you beg to give over your rights and freedom, your sovereignty, to a global police state.
[02:45:34.446 --> 02:45:40.390]  And what are the three circumstances that are most likely to springboard that police state?
[02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:50.537]  That are most likely to cause free citizens all across the country and all across the world to give up that freedom?
[02:45:53.078 --> 02:45:56.961]  War, plague, financial crisis.
[02:45:58.462 --> 02:46:01.504]  They're going to make you beg for universal basic income.
[02:46:02.768 --> 02:46:04.149]  They're going to crush the economy.
[02:46:04.169 --> 02:46:05.470]  They're going to destroy the economy.
[02:46:05.490 --> 02:46:17.036]  They're going to make the economy so unstable or at least appear to be so unstable that they can justify a sort of economic tyranny with the likes of which we've never seen before.
[02:46:17.096 --> 02:46:20.218]  And they're going to make you beg for universal basic income.
[02:46:21.172 --> 02:46:23.214]  And then they're going to release viruses.
[02:46:23.554 --> 02:46:36.064]  They're going to mistakenly leak viruses from level 5 pathogen labs that will eventually make you beg for vaccines.
[02:46:39.387 --> 02:46:41.969]  And last but not least, they're going to create so much chaos.
[02:46:41.989 --> 02:46:43.550]  They're going to create so much violence.
[02:46:43.570 --> 02:46:47.013]  They're going to create so much unlawfulness.
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:51.382]  That you're going to beg for martial law.
[02:46:52.843 --> 02:46:56.367]  Universal basic income, vaccines, martial law.
[02:46:57.688 --> 02:46:59.170]  And they can make you beg for it.
[02:47:00.071 --> 02:47:07.198]  And I see many of the conservative variety right now asking themselves about radical Islam or the dangers of radical Islam.
[02:47:07.498 --> 02:47:09.200]  What are we going to do about the Muslims?
[02:47:10.091 --> 02:47:11.592]  What are we going to do about Islam?
[02:47:11.613 --> 02:47:14.095]  Your founding fathers already sorted this out for you.
[02:47:14.115 --> 02:47:26.947]  Your founding fathers already gave you all the tools, all the ideological, philosophical tools you need as a citizen to be able to carry yourself in a way that's confident and righteous and sovereign.
[02:47:29.369 --> 02:47:30.250]  I don't fear Muslims.
[02:47:31.781 --> 02:47:40.487]  When we say free the Uyghurs, I get Muslims from all around the world that message me and say, hey, we appreciate you talking about the things that many of our own Muslim and Arab leaders won't talk about.
[02:47:41.348 --> 02:47:49.193]  We appreciate you calling for the Chinese government to be held to account for their, you know, their humanitarian crimes.
[02:47:51.234 --> 02:47:52.155]  We appreciate that.
[02:47:53.496 --> 02:47:55.737]  But just in general, I'm not afraid of Muslims.
[02:47:56.498 --> 02:48:00.981]  The Second Amendment protects me from any would-be victimizer that's out there.
[02:48:02.205 --> 02:48:07.593]  But many of us, we seem to think that if we have more police, then we'll be safer.
[02:48:09.096 --> 02:48:10.157]  Well, I'm just here to tell you.
[02:48:10.438 --> 02:48:11.780]  You know, I don't hate police.
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:13.402]  I'm not anti-police.
[02:48:13.823 --> 02:48:16.467]  But I know that 90% of the police took the vaccine.
[02:48:17.586 --> 02:48:32.252]  I know that 80-90% of the military took the vaccine, so obviously the people who were charged, who took an oath to protect us from tyranny, who took an oath to protect us from wickedness and enemies, foreign and domestic, have had a huge lapse in their moral judgment.
[02:48:35.913 --> 02:48:38.815]  Huge lapse in their moral judgment.
[02:48:38.835 --> 02:48:39.715]  And who do we look to now?
[02:48:41.434 --> 02:48:47.758]  Who do we look to when the institutions that we've trusted with our safety and our freedom have fallen victim to whatever?
[02:48:48.418 --> 02:48:53.902]  Whatever circumstance, whatever influence, whatever power that moves them.
[02:48:56.643 --> 02:49:08.611]  Whether it be worldly or otherworldly, whether it be, you know, here or metaphysical, whether it be corrupt crony capitalists, polite, polished, puppet politicians, or the great evil one himself, Satan.
[02:49:09.531 --> 02:49:10.252]  Who do we look to?
[02:49:11.457 --> 02:49:22.601]  When the people who we've trusted our safety and security and freedom to give over to the status quo.
[02:49:24.281 --> 02:49:27.162]  Well, our founding fathers were so brilliant, they already gave you the answer.
[02:49:27.522 --> 02:49:28.382]  You look to yourself.
[02:49:29.343 --> 02:49:29.923]  You look to you.
[02:49:30.263 --> 02:49:33.064]  You look to you, your family, your community, your loved ones.
[02:49:34.644 --> 02:49:36.885]  Small arm militias, the Second Amendment.
[02:49:37.566 --> 02:49:41.967]  You don't have to worry about radical Islam or any other radicals that would be out there in the world.
[02:49:41.987 --> 02:49:44.187]  You need to protect yourself at all times.
[02:49:44.927 --> 02:49:48.248]  And we're going to talk more about that over the course of this hour.
[02:49:49.128 --> 02:49:50.108]  I'm your host, Royce White.
[02:49:50.128 --> 02:49:51.648]  I'm happy to be with you this afternoon.
[02:49:52.449 --> 02:49:54.549]  Welcome and welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:55.449 --> 02:49:59.690]  I'm your guest host for the hour, Royce White, here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[02:50:00.270 --> 02:50:06.231]  And before the break, we were talking about the three, the three springboards to a global police state.
[02:50:07.518 --> 02:50:10.321]  One, violence, chaos, war.
[02:50:10.981 --> 02:50:12.703]  They're going to make you beg for martial law.
[02:50:13.003 --> 02:50:13.384]  Plague.
[02:50:13.964 --> 02:50:15.746]  They're going to make you beg for vaccines.
[02:50:16.947 --> 02:50:20.470]  They're going to make you beg for lockdowns to restrict the freedom of movement.
[02:50:21.711 --> 02:50:23.773]  And last but not least, financial crisis.
[02:50:23.793 --> 02:50:26.215]  They're going to make you beg for universal basic income.
[02:50:26.235 --> 02:50:29.679]  They're going to make you beg to restructure the global monetary system.
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:32.261]  And this isn't conjecture.
[02:50:32.301 --> 02:50:33.242]  We've seen it all before.
[02:50:34.787 --> 02:50:39.809]  We've seen World War become a means of a totalitarian police state.
[02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:41.850]  Wasn't global, but it was close.
[02:50:43.151 --> 02:50:50.294]  We've seen now through COVID that plague become the springboard to a call for the restriction of freedom of movement.
[02:50:52.576 --> 02:51:01.700]  And we've seen the financial crisis, the financial system be restructured on the tail end of a world war and on the tail end of a financial collapse.
[02:51:03.604 --> 02:51:04.945]  This was the Brentwoods Conference.
[02:51:04.985 --> 02:51:06.306]  This was post-World War II.
[02:51:06.346 --> 02:51:10.629]  This is the post-World War II Democratic-Liberal order that you live underneath now.
[02:51:13.310 --> 02:51:14.451]  And you are living underneath it.
[02:51:14.871 --> 02:51:15.972]  Right here, right now, today.
[02:51:19.674 --> 02:51:22.456]  And so I ask all my citizens out there today, what can you do?
[02:51:22.516 --> 02:51:24.197]  What will you be called to do?
[02:51:24.237 --> 02:51:25.678]  What will you be called to give up?
[02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:29.621]  What will you be called to give up to save the Republic?
[02:51:31.215 --> 02:51:34.296]  What will you be called to give up to save this country?
[02:51:37.018 --> 02:51:38.058]  I can't answer it for you.
[02:51:38.278 --> 02:51:39.098]  Only you can answer it.
[02:51:40.179 --> 02:51:41.860]  But you need to start to ask the question now.
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:43.420]  And you need to start to have an answer.
[02:51:43.861 --> 02:51:44.301]  Right now.
[02:51:45.381 --> 02:51:57.006]  Because when they start throwing truth tellers in prison, and putting them in solitary confinement, like Owen Schroeder, for speech crimes, the day is near.
[02:51:57.046 --> 02:51:58.407]  The darkness is coming.
[02:52:00.416 --> 02:52:03.218]  And I don't say that to be doom and gloom.
[02:52:03.318 --> 02:52:11.623]  Me and Alex and other people like us, we were made for a time such as this because I think part of us wakes up in the morning and we look forward to the fight.
[02:52:11.763 --> 02:52:12.243]  We're fighters.
[02:52:12.283 --> 02:52:35.603]   We look forward to a moment such as this where we can prove our faith and loyalty to God and our Our own sense and understanding of how to be righteous and good, and the defense of the weak and the vulnerable, and human beings all across the world, here in our home, here in our nation, here in our own family.
[02:52:35.662 --> 02:52:37.662]  We look forward to that fight.
[02:52:37.662 --> 02:52:42.022]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:52:42.022 --> 02:52:45.662]   You have to start to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice?
[02:52:46.033 --> 02:52:55.339]  What are you willing to sacrifice in the interest of freedom, in the interest of the ability to be able to practice your faith as you so choose, to speak your mind freely?
[02:52:56.859 --> 02:52:59.281]  I was watching a great debate.
[02:52:59.941 --> 02:53:04.724]  I went back and I watched a great debate again between Steve Bannon and David Frum.
[02:53:05.465 --> 02:53:14.650]  David Frum is a conservative stalwart in American politics from Canada, of the conservative neocon rhino variety.
[02:53:15.538 --> 02:53:25.801]  And he says right in the debate that conservatism, what we're trying to conserve is what's good about being liberal.
[02:53:27.101 --> 02:53:31.502]  And hey, I understand, you know, we're not here to demonize liberals or liberalize liberalism.
[02:53:31.542 --> 02:53:41.765]  There are many traditional liberals that, you know, so-called have a more American bent to their political worldview.
[02:53:43.038 --> 02:53:44.339]  But that's not really what he means.
[02:53:44.399 --> 02:53:45.480]  He means liberalism.
[02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:47.822]  He means liberalism as a cover for globalism.
[02:53:48.763 --> 02:53:59.073]  And when you say globalism, anybody who says globalism, including myself or Alex Jones or Steve Bannon or Donald Trump even, we get fenced as being anti-Semitic.
[02:54:02.676 --> 02:54:05.538]  There's nothing anti-Semitic about the word globalism.
[02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:09.302]  There's nothing anti-Semitic about it at all.
[02:54:10.043 --> 02:54:13.606]  And we're on the precipice of a fight there in Israel, a war in Israel.
[02:54:14.606 --> 02:54:37.343]  And once again, global forces, global institutions, a global agenda is going to use Jews and the fear of Jews or the fear for Jews to try and push us into a global conflict that undermines and erodes America, but also leaves the Middle East unstable and dangerous, even more dangerous for Israel.
[02:54:39.608 --> 02:54:56.821]  I haven't been on the show since this war broke out in Israel, but I've been one of the people that's out there that has the courage to speak about, you know, whether it be Bible 1 C 3 Christianity or Islam or the Jewish identity or any other cultural identity with a fourth row.
[02:54:58.062 --> 02:54:59.443]  Hell, the black bourgeoisie.
[02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:06.768]  Nobody am I more critical of than the black bourgeoisie, who are one of the fundamental linchpins of this entire globalist agenda.
[02:55:07.381 --> 02:55:17.230]  You know, give up your, you know, the white man's been so bad to you, give up your, your citizenship, your American national citizenship for a more fruitful global citizenship.
[02:55:18.051 --> 02:55:19.512]  Feel free to move about the world.
[02:55:20.593 --> 02:55:22.315]  Go travel, go travel to Israel.
[02:55:23.470 --> 02:55:24.491]  Go travel to Israel.
[02:55:24.851 --> 02:55:39.918]  But hey, if a terrorist attack breaks out in a country where they're surrounded by their enemies, and you get taken hostage, no real telling that we won't counter-strike and bomb Gaza and Palestine with you in it.
[02:55:42.399 --> 02:55:51.103]  And I had the chance to watch the Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones debate last night, and I thought it was an interesting conversation, and I tend to agree with Alex.
[02:55:52.628 --> 02:55:54.009]  That the Jews are being used.
[02:55:55.310 --> 02:55:59.092]  And what's more important to point out is there are Jews and then there are anti-Jews.
[02:55:59.152 --> 02:56:07.678]  Just like there are people who are black and then there are people who have black skin but don't really serve the fundamental interests and well-being and prosperity of black people.
[02:56:09.439 --> 02:56:22.006]   And so what Nick Fuentes' problem is, what many people's problem is, who have accepted this British intellectual tradition, Of social Darwinism, of Darwinism.
[02:56:22.986 --> 02:56:31.112]  What their problem is, is that they reduce human beings down to their prescribed categories.
[02:56:36.076 --> 02:56:37.497]  But it's not really effective.
[02:56:38.578 --> 02:56:41.460]  I mean, they've been at that now for quite a while.
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:48.845]  And they haven't been able to stop or cease any of the problems that continue to occur in the country.
[02:56:50.257 --> 02:57:02.408]  No, there are people who say they're black, who use the black identity, who use their black skin, who use their black appearance to make the claim or justify their willingness to participate in a corrupt status quo.
[02:57:04.289 --> 02:57:05.370]  We see that, we know that.
[02:57:05.650 --> 02:57:07.052]  Us black men are starting to wake up.
[02:57:07.572 --> 02:57:11.155]  That's why you're seeing people say, in words for Trump, it ain't about Trump.
[02:57:11.936 --> 02:57:17.721]  It's the understanding that they've been lied to and that black people traditionally have been used as the poster child of this scam.
[02:57:18.499 --> 02:57:21.340]  That's what made Kanye West relevant in politics.
[02:57:22.021 --> 02:57:27.284]  Throughout the entire hip-hop culture, there was this tasked approval of liberal politics.
[02:57:30.165 --> 02:57:33.447]  But just because you have black skin doesn't mean you're working in the interest of black people.
[02:57:33.487 --> 02:57:37.969]  And just because you say you're Jewish or you're a Jew doesn't mean you're working in the interest of Jewish people.
[02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:59.300]  In fact, some of the people, most of the people, a lot of the people, a lot of the prevailing elites in the Jewish community, especially internationally or politically, come right out and tell you that they don't believe in the fundamental tenets of being Jewish or being a Jew, which is the belief in submission to God.
[02:58:01.101 --> 02:58:02.742]  If you don't believe in God, you're not a Jew.
[02:58:02.802 --> 02:58:06.884]  The idea that you could be a Jew racially or ethnically is a complete scam.
[02:58:06.984 --> 02:58:12.447]  And somebody who's a Christian, who believes in the Bible, who understands the Bible and the Scripture, should be able to tell you that.
[02:58:13.347 --> 02:58:18.830]  And when Nick Fuentes fails to distinguish between the two, I ask myself, who is he and what is he up to?
[02:58:20.331 --> 02:58:22.892]  Why is he running people back into the arms of the left?
[02:58:24.611 --> 02:58:30.916]  With some half-baked explanation of such an important geopolitical matter at such an important geopolitical time.
[02:58:31.996 --> 02:58:33.037]  Stay through to the other side.
[02:58:33.057 --> 02:58:35.139]  We're going to talk more about Nick Fuentes.
[02:58:35.999 --> 02:58:37.500]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:37.961 --> 02:58:44.645]  I'm your host, Royce White, for the hour, guest host for the hour anyway, here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[02:58:45.126 --> 02:58:47.988]  And I'm so thankful and appreciative to the InfoWars team.
[02:58:48.743 --> 02:58:51.165]  And the great Alex Jones for allowing me to guest host.
[02:58:51.445 --> 02:58:55.808]  This is one of the most spiritually awake and conscious audiences in the entire world.
[02:58:55.948 --> 02:59:00.891]  The most spiritually awake and conscious audiences in the world.
[02:59:02.112 --> 02:59:07.796]  To go from being a fan as a young man to being able to host and contribute to the platform is an incredible honor.
[02:59:08.557 --> 02:59:09.697]  I'm running for United States Senate.
[02:59:09.717 --> 02:59:14.741]  I said earlier in the first hour, I'm running for United States Senate here in Minnesota against Amy Klobuchar.
[02:59:15.381 --> 02:59:16.142]  Status quo.
[02:59:17.316 --> 02:59:37.936]   Military industrial complex stalwart Amy Klobuchar expand the federal government at all costs Amy Klobuchar and and surely they'll use my being on this show as a as evidence or as a an indictment a disqualification for me to be able to hold the United States Senate seat but That's a good thing.
[02:59:38.096 --> 02:59:45.498]  And you know, the referendum in 24, from a political standpoint, is the referendum that all American citizens face every day.
[02:59:45.558 --> 02:59:50.000]  They wake up and participate in this nation's future.
[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:56.862]  The referendum is on us, what kind of leadership we want to accept, what kind of leadership we're willing to buy into, we're willing to follow.
[02:59:58.062 --> 02:59:59.522]  And we have a crisis of leadership.
[03:00:00.463 --> 03:00:29.525]   And have we followed people like great Alex Jones, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump had we followed a number of people in our in our past we maybe wouldn't be in this in this position and you know before we went to break I talked a little bit about Nick Fuentes and this this debate that Nick and Alex had over the past couple of days and then I thought it was an interesting conversation and I'll say in full transparency there are a lot of people out there who I disagree with on a fundamental basis about a lot of issues but I'm also
[03:00:31.215 --> 03:00:47.606]  I'm also honest enough to say when I do agree with somebody on some issue, and like Alex said yesterday when he was talking to Nick, there are some things that I agree with Nick on about this conflict, especially when it comes to foreign policy or American first foreign policy.
[03:00:48.506 --> 03:00:56.712]  Not one dollar should go to Israel, not one dollar should go to this conflict whatsoever or any other conflict until we close our border and we secure our own nation.
[03:00:57.589 --> 03:01:33.935]   Because we can't be a help to anybody around the country as long as we have this this huge gaping hole in in our own country At the same time To make the conversation all about Jews is just you know, it's just just a distraction and that's really what it becomes Look, nobody gets more upset, nobody has been more critical of people using the Jewish identity, in many respects the same as the black identity, as a historical premise to justify all of their would-be corrupt political agendas.
[03:01:35.046 --> 03:01:49.911]  And I do find that offensive and I do think it's an insult and I think it should be offensive and an insult to every Jew out there all across the world to see these certain individual Jewish political elites use that identity as a cudgel or as a scapegoat.
[03:01:53.173 --> 03:01:53.973]  Same with black people.
[03:01:54.787 --> 03:02:05.469]  It should offend you when a Hakeem Jeffries gets up before the American people and says, hey, elect me speaker so we can change the rules to suppress the rights of the minority.
[03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:34.587]   And that is what Hakeem Jeffries was suggesting, and that is what many of these conservative rhino neocon Republicans were suggesting, that coming together with the Democrats to change the House rules So as to suppress the rights of the minority, in this case being Matt Gaetz and the other eight who challenged the budget, the CR bill and McCarthy, that's exactly what they were calling for.
[03:02:35.784 --> 03:02:49.128]  And you gotta kind of chuckle at the audacity of some of these political elites to be able to look you in the face, to be able to march a black man up on the stage and say, let's change the Congress to suppress the rights of the minority voices.
[03:02:49.188 --> 03:02:50.688]  I mean, it's pretty brazen.
[03:02:51.028 --> 03:02:51.849]  It's pretty brazen.
[03:02:52.389 --> 03:03:08.590]   In the same way, it's pretty brazen to say that we have a biblical claim or a spiritual claim to a land when the same people Reject the fundamental tenets of that faith tradition.
[03:03:09.791 --> 03:03:10.892]  You can't have it both ways.
[03:03:11.312 --> 03:03:19.599]  You can't have a spiritual claim to the land and not believe in the spiritual life or believe in the spiritual deity and to believe in God.
[03:03:20.219 --> 03:03:21.120]  The two don't go together.
[03:03:21.961 --> 03:03:26.945]  And Marxism and Zionism are, you know, very, very similar.
[03:03:27.026 --> 03:03:28.106]  Very similar indeed.
[03:03:28.587 --> 03:03:35.773]  And I think in here, you know, we have a war of the isms, a great misinformation of the isms, and people get very caught up.
[03:03:36.571 --> 03:03:44.493]  They use it in either direction, either to affirm their political worldview or to challenge others' political worldview.
[03:03:45.153 --> 03:03:47.634]  It's a common calling card.
[03:03:48.134 --> 03:03:58.037]  You have to know the history to be able to approach a topic with the broadness and the level of accuracy that Alex Jones often does.
[03:03:59.033 --> 03:04:07.338]  And it's why he's beloved, it's why he's revered, it's why he's respected, it's why he's an essential, has been an essential player in trying to change this narrative.
[03:04:08.178 --> 03:04:18.244]  And it takes time, it takes commitment, it takes discipline to read the literature, to read, to go back and do the research and look at the history to know what we're really faced with.
[03:04:18.304 --> 03:04:26.248]  And right now, most of all, we're faced with a sort of psyop on multiple fronts in a war of isms.
[03:04:28.619 --> 03:04:30.400]  And Marxism and Zionism is one of them.
[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:43.368]  I was on Jason Whitlock's show earlier on Tuesday evening, early in the week on Tuesday evening, and I said on the show that Marxism, you know, you can look at Marxism as an offshoot of Zionism or Zionism as an offshoot of Marxism.
[03:04:44.249 --> 03:04:52.574]  And somebody in the comments, it's funny, I read the comments, a few of the comments now and then, and one of the people in the comments said that Marxism and Zionism had nothing to do with one another.
[03:04:53.248 --> 03:05:01.637]  That Marxism was a more egalitarian, global sort of, you know, collectivist idea, and Zionism is about the nation.
[03:05:02.859 --> 03:05:13.230]  And while some of that is true, when you go back and look at the founding members, I mean the founding thought leaders of both movements, you run into similar people such as Moses Hess.
[03:05:13.874 --> 03:05:16.735]  I don't know if they can bring up Moses Hess in the studio there.
[03:05:16.775 --> 03:05:18.456]  You can bring up his Wikipedia if you want.
[03:05:18.476 --> 03:05:21.117]  That would be helpful that people can take a look at that.
[03:05:21.157 --> 03:05:43.499]   I mean, this information isn't really hidden, which is how it's so strange to see when a topic like Israel or the Middle East or the United Nations or the Balfour Declaration or any of these sensitive political issues come up that people's narrative gets so warped and they become so So crazy in trying to talk about these things.
[03:05:43.539 --> 03:05:45.200]  This history is there for you to find.
[03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:53.623]  Moses Hess was a German Jewish philosopher, thought leader of both the communist variety and the early Zionist variety.
[03:05:54.543 --> 03:06:04.567]  And so yeah, there is crossover in the earliest days of communist thought, of communist intellectual tradition there in Europe and what would become Marxism and then what would become Zionism.
[03:06:05.248 --> 03:06:18.034]  Now, Moses has had a different idea than Hagel and Marx in saying that, hey, the bottom line of society, of human society, isn't resources and wages.
[03:06:18.674 --> 03:06:35.933]   There's a more important racial and national element to the proper construction of government or nations or, you know, authority, let's say in the end, or organization, for lack
[03:06:35.933 --> 03:06:36.375]  of a better term.
[03:06:36.375 --> 03:06:46.414]   And so, you know, in that way Zionism, strangely enough, would start to, in the
[03:06:46.414 --> 03:06:50.715]   wake of Italian nationalism at the time, there was an Italian nationalism that
[03:06:50.715 --> 03:06:55.734]   Moses has referred to, and Moses has called for, in one of his books, the
[03:06:55.734 --> 03:07:01.574]   establishment of a socialist commonwealth in a place called Palestine.
[03:06:59.778 --> 03:07:02.561]  Now, this narrative is so twisted up here.
[03:07:03.101 --> 03:07:16.927]  That you'll have some people who are pro-Israel say that Palestine doesn't exist, or you'll have some people who are against Israel say that Zionism and Marxism aren't necessarily the same thing, and the thing is just all twisted up.
[03:07:17.667 --> 03:07:24.430]  And I just want to spend the second half of the show, if I can, a little bit talking about this idea, the war of isms.
[03:07:27.518 --> 03:07:29.959]  Yes, Zionism was a socialist movement.
[03:07:30.159 --> 03:07:32.700]  It was a socialist, a nationalist socialist movement.
[03:07:33.220 --> 03:07:42.104]  In the same way the American media has made you believe that Nazism and communism are juxtaposed in politics.
[03:07:42.224 --> 03:07:43.324]  They're not juxtaposed.
[03:07:44.685 --> 03:07:46.685]  Nazism was a socialist movement.
[03:07:46.765 --> 03:07:53.728]  Socialist has its roots, you know, has its roots in communist ideology and communist thinking and Marxist thinking.
[03:07:55.976 --> 03:07:56.956]  So we're getting played.
[03:07:57.216 --> 03:08:07.538]  I mean, when we create these prejudgments and these ways of talking about important geopolitical issues, we find ourselves often getting played.
[03:08:07.558 --> 03:08:16.600]  And I'm here to try and offer some voice of reason to sift through the madness and look at the real history to see what's really going on, to see the situation as it really is.
[03:08:17.140 --> 03:08:18.480]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:18.540 --> 03:08:22.241]  I am your guest host, Royce White, here in the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:08:22.301 --> 03:08:35.858]   Thankful To the great Alex Jones and Infowars for allowing me to guest host, praying and thinking about Owen Schroyer and all of those who have become victim to this kangaroo court, banana republic, Donald Trump and the crosshairs as well.
[03:08:35.918 --> 03:08:44.183]  And now we're going to see a bunch of rats turn state's evidence and perjure themselves from former testimony in the interest of destroying and bringing Donald Trump down.
[03:08:44.223 --> 03:08:46.364]  I mean, the game plan is very obvious.
[03:08:46.404 --> 03:09:07.670]   And hopefully I'll be back on in the coming weeks to talk more about this, this, uh, This situation, that situation, the tyranny that many of you already know we face, but if I can, if you'll allow me, I want to spend a little bit of time in the second half of the show, the second half hour of the show, talking about the War of Isms.
[03:09:08.502 --> 03:09:20.007]  I watched the Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones debate, and obviously on my own podcast, Please Call Me Crazy, which you can find on YouTube, I've been talking about this conflict in Israel, and I hold no punches.
[03:09:20.327 --> 03:09:26.250]  There's nobody that can say that there's any Zionist, international Zionist conspiracy given Royce White a phone call.
[03:09:26.310 --> 03:09:27.391]  I can guarantee you that.
[03:09:28.071 --> 03:09:36.596]   In fact, when I was in the NBA, many of the Many of the NBA owners and the power brokers there are Jewish, at least by their own identity.
[03:09:37.457 --> 03:09:41.980]  And I was made an offer multiple times to shut my mouth and go along to get along.
[03:09:42.060 --> 03:09:43.842]  And I told them to keep the money.
[03:09:44.602 --> 03:09:49.946]  And I told them that I thought I was going to outlive them, both here and in the intern.
[03:09:54.336 --> 03:10:11.163]  Come from but I do want to say just just on a on a real strategic political basis as somebody who's running for office I am acutely aware of how these narratives have been used to distract people From the action that that that needs to that needs to take place number one.
[03:10:11.183 --> 03:10:32.182]   I want to I want to I want to promote Precinct strategy calm please and and hopefully I'll be able to get the great Dan Schultz on with Alex Jones and and all of you Conscious, awake viewers out in the audience will hear the call, will see the beacon to come into the only party that has any chance of saving this great Republican.
[03:10:32.202 --> 03:10:33.423]  That is the Republican Party.
[03:10:33.443 --> 03:10:54.254]   If you support Donald Trump and you support America First politics, we're going to have to go into a gritty Uh, all out, knock down, drag out fight with the Rhino establishment, with the neocon establishment to help elect and endorse Republican candidates that reflect America first policy.
[03:10:55.341 --> 03:10:56.542]  And that's not going to be easy.
[03:10:56.602 --> 03:11:03.526]  Like the great Steve Bannon said on his show earlier in the week, the Uniparty is not just going to sit down and give over the reins of power.
[03:11:04.167 --> 03:11:04.987]  They fought for this.
[03:11:05.247 --> 03:11:07.969]  They fought against this speaker election.
[03:11:07.989 --> 03:11:09.730]  And we'll see how Mike Johnson does.
[03:11:10.410 --> 03:11:12.471]  I like a lot of what he has to say, that's for sure.
[03:11:12.491 --> 03:11:13.432]  But I'm the hatchet man.
[03:11:13.472 --> 03:11:14.353]  I'm the watchful eye.
[03:11:14.393 --> 03:11:16.814]  So I have my eyes on everybody, any and everybody.
[03:11:17.034 --> 03:11:18.835]  And that there are no exceptions to that.
[03:11:19.696 --> 03:11:28.841]   And that's how every American citizen should approach Should approach their participation in this country in their own citizenship and certainly in the political process.
[03:11:29.482 --> 03:11:33.646]  So go to precinctstrategy.com and learn how to become a delegate.
[03:11:33.886 --> 03:11:35.588]  Learn how to become a precinct committeeman.
[03:11:35.968 --> 03:12:00.964]   The Republican Party is only one-third full, so when we complain about rhinos and neocons and we continue to allow the vacant seats of the Republican Party to sit empty, We're showing that our political participation, that our political emotion and passion or conviction is either been co-opted and absorbed into something that is not useful activity and not productivity.
[03:12:01.384 --> 03:12:02.444]  There's something we can do.
[03:12:03.344 --> 03:12:04.945]  There's at least something that we can try.
[03:12:05.746 --> 03:12:15.550]  And now they may be able to change the rules so that the precinct committee men's seats and the delegate process won't be what it is today, but they will not have time to change that before the 2024 election.
[03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:47.964]   If we can get another 100,000 seats filled in the Republican Party with precinct committee men, or if we can rush the party with delegates, with America First delegates, come caucus time, we can endorse America First candidates, and if nothing else, those delegates Those delegates are going to be able to stick around after the election if we are able to pull off the win to elect our RNC committeeman and our RNC chairman.
[03:12:50.846 --> 03:12:52.787]  That's going to be just as important a role.
[03:12:53.638 --> 03:13:01.064]  And if you're just one of those people at home that says, hell with the political process because it's rigged or it's, you know, it's whatever the case may be.
[03:13:01.504 --> 03:13:10.931]  Hey, anytime I was in a basketball game and I felt like the ref had it in for me, I felt like the ref had had a bias towards me or was maybe rooting for the other team or had a relation.
[03:13:11.291 --> 03:13:21.339]  All I did was play as hard as I possibly could and I let everybody leave that arena with the consensus, with the feeling that they just saw a man be cheated.
[03:13:22.379 --> 03:13:26.160]  And there is something valuable in that, especially in our American political culture.
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:28.261]  So, PrecinctStrategy.com.
[03:13:28.681 --> 03:13:31.822]  Don't sit in your home and talk about politics.
[03:13:31.902 --> 03:13:33.843]  Go be a part of the political process.
[03:13:34.203 --> 03:13:40.005]  Become involved and fight back against the Uniparty and the RINO and the neocons from the inside.
[03:13:40.085 --> 03:13:41.446]  PrecinctStrategy.com.
[03:13:43.948 --> 03:14:00.118]  Before the break, I was talking about the historical roots of Zionism and Marxism, and I brought up Moses Hess, and the producers there helped me out by showing a picture of Moses Hess, brought him up right on Wikipedia.
[03:14:00.158 --> 03:14:11.766]  This stuff isn't hidden, but there were early communist thinkers that were involved in both the flourishing of Marxism and also what would become Zionism.
[03:14:12.541 --> 03:14:22.024]  And there's this sort of juxtaposition right now in American political culture, or the mainstream media at least, that you have communism and socialism as opposed to Nazism.
[03:14:22.704 --> 03:14:26.746]  And that the two are, you know, two sides of a different coin.
[03:14:27.206 --> 03:14:29.166]  But really they're two sides of the same coin.
[03:14:29.707 --> 03:14:39.656]   And when you get into the world war of isms, when you get into the history of isms, you see a clear trajectory that leads back to one Root, and that is secularism.
[03:14:39.777 --> 03:14:50.125]  Secularism in a post-Enlightenment Europe that then became liberalism, that then became communism, that then became what we have today, the effort and impulse towards globalism.
[03:14:51.266 --> 03:14:57.631]  And there are other little isms sprinkled in there, and Nazism and Zionism and fascism are all a part of it.
[03:14:58.152 --> 03:15:05.118]  But this idea that Zionism and Nazism are a different thing is a scam too.
[03:15:06.644 --> 03:15:24.822]   I mean, the only difference between Zionism and Marxism, as laid out by Moses Hess in his call to establish a Jewish Commonwealth, A Jewish socialist commonwealth in a place called Palestine.
[03:15:25.202 --> 03:15:37.166]  The only difference between the two is that Moses saw a need for racial and national priority on their socialist ambitions, on their socialist politics.
[03:15:39.039 --> 03:15:48.906]  And we often forget, we often let the mainstream media call foul against nationalism and borders, and they use Nazism as a pretext to do that.
[03:15:49.066 --> 03:15:52.569]  That Nazism was this fascist ideology.
[03:15:52.669 --> 03:15:54.150]  It was a socialist ideology.
[03:15:54.910 --> 03:15:56.691]  It was the National Socialist Party.
[03:15:57.472 --> 03:15:58.713]  And they were socialists.
[03:16:00.048 --> 03:16:01.029]  And who were the Nazis?
[03:16:01.509 --> 03:16:15.057]  They were the working class that unionized, that became the bourgeoisie, that took control of the political system, or the political apparatus, and they solidified that control through a police state.
[03:16:15.838 --> 03:16:17.418]  That's exactly what we have here today.
[03:16:17.438 --> 03:16:19.880]  That's exactly what we have here right now.
[03:16:20.848 --> 03:16:27.470]  And to be quite honest with you, when we talk about the Nazis or Nazi Germany being an ethno-national state, absolutely.
[03:16:27.810 --> 03:16:47.337]  The difference between Nazism and Marxism is that Nazism, you know, much like Zionism, by the way, respectfully, both Nazism and Zionism place a priority on racial, on race.
[03:16:49.887 --> 03:16:54.549]  That there's a racial superiority component to both Nazism and Zionism.
[03:16:55.629 --> 03:17:01.692]  Whereas Marxism had a more broad idea about taking collectivism.
[03:17:02.848 --> 03:17:24.678]  And economic oppression, quote unquote, economic oppression, resources and wages as a way to galvanize a totalitarian and an all out police state or authoritarian state through the narrative of collectivism and a collectivism that could reach the far corners of the earth.
[03:17:25.278 --> 03:17:26.379]  And that was Marx's goal.
[03:17:26.419 --> 03:17:27.539]  That was Marx's idea.
[03:17:28.540 --> 03:17:30.300]  And in many ways, they've achieved that idea.
[03:17:30.340 --> 03:17:31.521]  We've already lost that fight.
[03:17:32.048 --> 03:17:36.131]  But we've lost that fight because we've let them separate us into false teams.
[03:17:38.173 --> 03:17:45.218]  Both Zionism and Marxism and Nationalism, all of them were socialist worker parties, were socialist worker movements.
[03:17:46.219 --> 03:17:48.881]  The difference was at what they put at the masthead.
[03:17:48.901 --> 03:17:51.043]  The difference was what they put as their header.
[03:17:51.663 --> 03:17:53.845]  Zionism, Nazism, race.
[03:17:53.985 --> 03:17:54.866]  There's a race component.
[03:17:54.886 --> 03:17:55.967]  There's a race superiority.
[03:17:56.167 --> 03:17:59.049]  There's a race priority in their worldview.
[03:17:59.907 --> 03:18:01.667]  Marxism had much bigger plans.
[03:18:02.068 --> 03:18:02.748]  Bigger than race.
[03:18:03.828 --> 03:18:05.748]  And we're fighting all three systems right now.
[03:18:05.948 --> 03:18:08.249]  We're fighting against all three factions right now.
[03:18:08.329 --> 03:18:10.089]  And they're fighting each other in some cases.
[03:18:10.890 --> 03:18:13.450]  But we have to be wise enough to find our own anchor.
[03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:15.931]  We have to be wise enough to find our own solid ground.
[03:18:16.311 --> 03:18:17.931]  And the solid ground for us is simple.
[03:18:18.431 --> 03:18:19.492]  We're American citizens.
[03:18:20.592 --> 03:18:24.973]  And that's the true modus operandi of America First policy.
[03:18:25.493 --> 03:18:30.478]   We're trying to find our anchors in the midst of a war Of the isms.
[03:18:32.019 --> 03:18:33.519]  And what better than Americanism?
[03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:36.920]  What better than we are American citizens?
[03:18:36.980 --> 03:18:41.302]  We have free will and inalienable rights granted to us by a creator.
[03:18:42.281 --> 03:18:44.281]  Stay tuned to the other side.
[03:18:44.281 --> 03:18:52.281]  I've not been this excited ever!

[03:19:27.723 --> 03:19:30.784]  We have a flash sale of DNA Force Plus that is our flagship product.

[03:19:59.685 --> 03:20:02.805]   lot of the products. You're responding, we're selling a lot of the product. But we've
[03:20:02.805 --> 03:20:05.365]   got to sell even more of it to be able to fund ourselves so it's a Catch-22.

[03:20:44.721 --> 03:20:56.549]  Please spread the word about the broadcasts, how we bypass the sensors and the controllers, and how we expose the plan to launch the new 9-11 in South America and Europe to bring us under the total police state control grid.
[03:20:56.809 --> 03:21:04.294]  They're doing it with COVID, they're doing it with the climate change garbage, they're doing it with the water power grab, and now they're coming for all of our freedoms.
[03:21:05.054 --> 03:21:07.617]  We've got to stop and we've got to recognize that we've got to wake up.
[03:21:07.657 --> 03:21:13.605]  We've got to say no, but it takes funds and money and word of mouth to run this operation in the face of these sensors and controllers.
[03:21:13.985 --> 03:21:22.616]  So I'm counting on you to break the back of the sensors and the controllers by sharing the live links to this show right now and supporting the broadcast at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:21:22.776 --> 03:21:23.417]  Thank you so much.
