[00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:02.618]  It's official.
[00:00:03.118 --> 00:00:06.083]  They're now admitting Zelensky and NATO have lost the war in Ukraine.
[00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:07.985]  It's Tuesday, December 12th, 2023.
[00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:10.789]  This is gonna be one hell of a transmission.
[00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.632]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:16.037]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:17.920]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:32.307]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:34.671]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:41.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:24.626]  Former Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza is under investigation for homicide after emails reveal that from the very start of the vaccinations he knew the shots were killing people and gave orders to local health authorities to conceal deaths and serious side effects in order to reassure Italian citizens of their safety and to not jeopardize the vaccination campaign.
[00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:29.190]  The story has been reported on both German and Italian news networks.
[00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.073]  I will now provide an English translation.
[00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:42.664]  The Rome Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating Roberto Speranza, the Italian government's health minister, during the time of COVID measures.
[00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:45.687]  He was responsible for the vaccination campaign.
[00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:53.892]  The investigations are the result of complaints related to the so-called AIFA emails from the Italian Medicines Agency.
[00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:59.715]  The former director of AIFA, Nicola Magrini, is also under investigation.
[00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:08.160]  The publication of these internal emails revealed that they had been aware of the dangers of the COVID vaccination from the start.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.084]  The accusation is that the responsible minister and the head of the drug authority, knowingly and deliberately,
[00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:19.668]  Exposed the unsuspecting Italian population to this risk.
[00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:23.611]  Yes, they encouraged Italians to get vaccinated.
[00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:27.975]  Vaccination was even made mandatory for certain professional groups.
[00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.437]  Consequently, many side effects.
[00:02:30.777 --> 00:02:32.997]  Including fatal ones came to light.
[00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:38.018]  The investigations are for murder, serious bodily harm, and more.
[00:02:38.418 --> 00:02:56.662]  Because Speranza and Magrini evidently gave instructions to the local health authorities to conceal the deaths and serious side effects that occurred immediately after the vaccinations began in order not to jeopardize the vaccination campaign and to reassure the citizens about their safety.
[00:02:57.262 --> 00:03:02.589]  The responsible minister and the head of IEFA are now expected to answer for these actions.
[00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:12.822]  According to the complaints from the police unions and the financial police, as well as from the private organization, Listen to Me, which represents 4,200 people damaged by vaccines.
[00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:21.471]  In Italy, police officers and teachers were subjected to mandatory COVID vaccination.
[00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:28.877]  Here is the former health minister, Roberto Speranza, proudly announcing vaccination statistics in Italy.
[00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:34.562]  We have now reached a massively significant percentage of vaccinated people in Italy, 89.41%.
[00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:37.184]  Therefore, currently in Italy, just over 10% of the population remains unvaccinated.
[00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:51.895]  Well, today, Roberto Speranza is under investigation for lies he allegedly told about vaccines.
[00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:56.797]  Among the crimes he is accused of are ideological falsehood and murder.
[00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:00.780]  Look, this is the document we are showing you tonight exclusively.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:13.447]  It states the former minister, Roberto Speranza, along with Nicola Magrini, the former general manager of AIFA, are both registered in the investigative records of the Rome Prosecutor's Office.
[00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:25.255]  Last week, the House of Representatives of the Philippines passed a resolution to investigate over 260,000 unexplained excess deaths in 2021 and 67,000 unexplained excess deaths in 2022.
[00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:27.936]  The next day, they were hit by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake.
[00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.818]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:04.686]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:06.087 --> 00:05:10.329]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.

[00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:32.654]  We're live!
[00:06:33.134 --> 00:06:35.375]  Another historic transmission now begins.
[00:06:36.408 --> 00:06:37.568]  Tuesday, December 12th, 2023.
[00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:41.030]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.810]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.491]  328 days, 12 hours, 63 minutes, 27 seconds left.
[00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:51.413]  Until the most important election in world history.
[00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:55.574]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:06:57.315 --> 00:06:57.695]  Alright.
[00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:04.097]  I was already coming in this morning, I hadn't looked at Drudge, and I was planning to go with this headline, and oh, there it is!
[00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:06.863]  Z for Defeat!
[00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:10.826]  That was the earlier headline, overhead shot please.
[00:07:11.446 --> 00:07:12.607]  Z for Defeat!
[00:07:13.368 --> 00:07:17.391]  Biden Aid Package Risk Collapse Ukraine on Cusp of Losing War.
[00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:25.458]  George Soros went on Fareed Zarqari's show seven years ago.
[00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:27.842]  Played the clip probably 500 times.
[00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:40.369]  We played it again and he said, two years ago we got five billion dollars and we overthrew the government and now we're going to start a war with Russia and they're going to call me the new czar of Russia.
[00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.072]  All of that is meant to enrage the Russians and start a war with them.
[00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:53.636]  And then if you're against a war on the edge of Russian territory, starting a fight with them, you're a Russian agent folks.
[00:07:55.316 --> 00:08:00.761]  We don't like sending hundreds of billions of dollars into a black hole so Hunter Biden can get more hookers and crack cocaine.
[00:08:02.723 --> 00:08:03.563]  You're a Russian agent.
[00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:07.046]  And we don't like Biden being on the Chai Com titty.
[00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.147]  You're a Russian agent.
[00:08:08.207 --> 00:08:09.308]  No, I'm an American.
[00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:10.950]  But first I'm a Christian.
[00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.232]  And then I'm a father.
[00:08:13.652 --> 00:08:14.553]  And then I'm an American.
[00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:16.935]  I serve God.
[00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.837]  I serve my family.
[00:08:19.297 --> 00:08:20.378]  Then I serve my country.
[00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:22.200]  I'm proud of our Republic.
[00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:23.862]  And it's
[00:08:46.349 --> 00:08:51.032]  RT, main channel, broadcast all over the world today, live for 35 minutes.
[00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.954]  And I laid all this out, and they're going to have headlines everywhere.
[00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:56.195]  Jones is a Russian agent, he went on Russian TV.
[00:08:57.116 --> 00:08:58.937]  I think Biden should be on Russian TV.
[00:09:00.158 --> 00:09:01.739]  I think Senator Rand Paul should be on there.
[00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:03.079]  I think Elon Musk should be on there.
[00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:05.481]  I think Putin should be on US TV.
[00:09:06.141 --> 00:09:09.583]  Like, you know, Kennedy did, and Khrushchev did.
[00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:13.266]  We need to start talking to these people, and we need to stop this right now.
[00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.448]  No, I'm an agent of living.
[00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:19.770]  I'm an agent of not having a nuclear war.
[00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.233]  Because I love all my children.
[00:09:23.253 --> 00:09:28.696]  I got four of them, but the other three are pretty much grown up.
[00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:29.717]  21, 19, and 15.
[00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:32.319]  But man, there's something about
[00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:39.614]  Your little girls, little boys too, my six and a half year old daughter, she's so innocent, so good, so sweet.
[00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:42.656]  You see God in there, God made that, the innocence.
[00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:46.859]  And I just get beyond pissed off, I get committed.
[00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:54.283]  When I look at her, I know the world these psychos are building and trying to force us into, and I just tell them, I'm not going along with this.
[00:09:54.984 --> 00:10:00.107]  I want stability, I want prosperity, I want security, I want freedom.
[00:10:01.604 --> 00:10:05.526]  And if you look at what the globalists offer, they offer the opposite on every front.
[00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:15.672]  I mean, folks, a document has now come out in the State House, and we know this because it's already happened, and they've already proposed it around the country, and a bunch of cities have already put it in place.
[00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:22.956]  Last time I checked, over 100 major cities, it was 107, the last document I saw, let illegal aliens vote.
[00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:28.039]  Oh, but only local elections, but then they actually vote in the state and federal.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.621]  And there's a new document out.
[00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:33.748]  In New York, where they're going to have the illegal aliens vote, period.
[00:10:35.588 --> 00:10:38.329]  I mean, just that's an incredible story right there.
[00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.750]  Frontlines.
[00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:46.232]  Mayorkas warns of heightened terror threat amid war in the Middle East and immigration crisis.
[00:10:48.712 --> 00:10:50.713]  New York lawmaker claims smoking gun.
[00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.174]  It's not smoking gun, it's a real document.
[00:10:53.474 --> 00:10:55.434]  In New York City, migrant voter fraud scheme.
[00:10:55.975 --> 00:10:56.955]  I got the documents right here.
[00:10:58.228 --> 00:11:00.029]  And then freezing weather hits New York.
[00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:05.752]  They have hundreds of thousands of illegals just everywhere, sleeping in unheated warehouses.
[00:11:05.812 --> 00:11:07.273]  I mean, they tell people, come here.
[00:11:08.814 --> 00:11:13.576]  We have more video out of Chicago where 3,000 people are in a tiny warehouse with two bathrooms.
[00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:19.140]  I mean, this is just so out of control.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:25.143]  And we're going to be hitting on all of that because that's front and center in the third hour with Anthony Rubin.
[00:11:26.598 --> 00:11:50.419]  You know, when we talk to Michael Young, who's such a great reporter and former Special Forces operative, been in hundreds of battles, this is a reporter, he says, talking about a stud, this guest we've got coming on, Anthony Rubin, he's the guy for years, with some of his other compadres, on the trains from Central America all the way up to Texas and California and Arizona,
[00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:56.374]  With the illegal alien hordes coming in, and now it's into the hundreds of thousands every couple weeks.
[00:11:56.534 --> 00:11:57.415]  I mean, it is crazy.
[00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:58.175]  He's got all the footage.
[00:11:58.395 --> 00:11:58.775]  He's here.
[00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.436]  He was on American Journal with Harris Smith this morning.
[00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:04.696]  He'll be with us in the studio in the third hour.
[00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:10.478]  Jack Posobiec has got to come on again today because Jack is just so 100% dead on.
[00:12:11.118 --> 00:12:14.219]  So I asked him to come on today to talk about the Zelensky situation.
[00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:18.831]  And the war, it's rapidly moving so quickly.
[00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:28.455]  And he said, sure, I'll come on, but I also want to get into, he said, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds under fire over satanic idol and altar on display inside the state capitol.
[00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:30.997]  This is going on everywhere.
[00:12:31.397 --> 00:12:36.319]  So they're taking down George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who told you it would start with Robert E. Lee.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.321]  And now it's that.
[00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:41.222]  Oh, it's their right too, their free speech.
[00:12:42.389 --> 00:13:01.311]  Ladies and gentlemen, this group says they conduct abortions as a ritual to kill babies and even major publications like the Washington Post and women's magazines and others, we covered it last week, major ones,
[00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:07.271]  are saying how women can go kill their baby and how much fun it is and how much power Satan will give them.
[00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:15.473]  And you go to Target and they've got dozens of books for little kids to conjure demons, books for seven-year-olds, how they can worship Satan and conjure demons.
[00:13:15.993 --> 00:13:21.175]  This isn't throwing it in Christians' faces and LARPing or trolling.
[00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:22.535]  This is who they are.
[00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:23.536]  And I'm going to explain to you again.
[00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:30.538]  God gives us experiences in our life to teach us how the world really works for missions God has for us.
[00:13:30.598 --> 00:13:31.178]  And most people
[00:13:32.526 --> 00:13:34.748]  End up never really taking the mission on that God offers them.
[00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:36.530]  And that's fine.
[00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:42.196]  As long as you still love God and try to do the right thing and ask Christ your heart, I think you're going to be all right.
[00:13:42.816 --> 00:13:49.183]  But I was like growing up in a rich area of Dallas, richest area in Texas at the time.
[00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:55.149]  And I was just like, what is up with all the devil worship with the rich people?
[00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.410]  And
[00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:00.717]  I was like, why am I being shown this?
[00:14:00.977 --> 00:14:03.959]  Why am I getting caught up in this?
[00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:18.730]  I mean, I never took part in the rituals, but I mean, I've literally been taken to eyes wide shut type events and had to leave and walk down the highway back before they had, you know, people had cell phones and knock on a farmer's door and have my dad drive 40 minutes out in the country to pick me up.
[00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:20.571]  Because I've been there, folks.
[00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:21.352]  I mean, eyes wide shut.
[00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:22.553]  Eyes wide shut.
[00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:34.774]  I just thought, man, I'm lucky I'm dating the sexiest girl in the high school, the high school senior, when I'm a freshman, and I was promiscuous, and it's like, and it happened repeatedly again.
[00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:44.142]  Because these cults are real, ladies and gentlemen, and the devil doesn't have an omnipresence, but the devil can pick up on things.
[00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.944]  And the devil's like, we're going to get this guy.
[00:14:47.998 --> 00:14:49.179]  And that's how they operate.
[00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:50.139]  They're all over the place.
[00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.160]  They're devil worshippers.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.401]  Just all over the place, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:53.881 --> 00:14:59.424]  And I told you this for a long time, and now it's out in the open.
[00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:03.627]  And I still didn't learn my lesson.
[00:15:03.647 --> 00:15:11.411]  A few months later, oh, one of the other hottest chicks from the nearby school, you know, driving her Jaguar.
[00:15:12.832 --> 00:15:14.272]  Oh, she lives in a 20-bedroom house.
[00:15:14.392 --> 00:15:14.833]  Oh, she, you know.
[00:15:16.201 --> 00:15:18.823]  Oh, you know, she's a high school senior, too.
[00:15:18.863 --> 00:15:19.724]  She wants to date me.
[00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:27.669]  And then, I'm on top of her, and she's, you know, you really ought to join our group.
[00:15:29.671 --> 00:15:32.513]  Then I'm leaving the house, and the dad's like, you enjoy having sex with my daughter?
[00:15:33.153 --> 00:15:33.713]  I sure do.
[00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:35.235]  Why don't you join us, Jones?
[00:15:37.096 --> 00:15:38.417]  These people are for real.
[00:15:39.755 --> 00:15:41.336]  And they're all over the place.
[00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:45.820]  And they've been building the army under the surface, and now they're launching.
[00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:49.203]  Alright, I've been there, I've seen it.
[00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:51.805]  Yeah, Tom Cruise is in a movie.
[00:15:52.325 --> 00:15:53.086]  I've actually been there.
[00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:54.467]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:09.302]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[00:16:09.763 --> 00:16:10.664]  You would rally against it?
[00:16:10.684 --> 00:16:11.204]  You would fight it?
[00:16:11.584 --> 00:16:12.946]  And that's what we're doing.
[00:16:13.426 --> 00:16:14.527]  This is the reality of 2023.
[00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:15.968]  Let's go!

[00:17:09.405 --> 00:17:20.732]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.

[00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:40.802]  X2.

[00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:48.565]  It's the missing link.
[00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:52.647]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family, but has the opposite effect.
[00:17:53.107 --> 00:17:56.608]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[00:17:56.808 --> 00:17:58.469]  X2, back in stock right now.

[00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:09.593]  And these are game-changing products.

[00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.143]  We've got 3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.

[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:05.281]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[00:19:05.742 --> 00:19:10.103]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:19:10.563 --> 00:19:13.024]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:19:13.604 --> 00:19:22.986]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[00:20:01.249 --> 00:20:07.157]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.456 --> 00:20:30.061]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.442 --> 00:20:33.791]  Back to Summit's got more big breaking news coming up next segment.
[00:20:35.157 --> 00:20:37.938]  Let me do this, because I'm going to hit all this today, one way or another.
[00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:40.199]  Let me just go over the headlines here.
[00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:47.042]  First off, as I mentioned, Z for defeat, Biden aid package risk collapse, Ukraine on cusp of losing war.
[00:20:47.923 --> 00:20:53.305]  As if $26 million could beat $180 million or whatever the Russians have got in all their weapons.
[00:20:54.006 --> 00:21:03.070]  I mean, this is just sick and evil, and they knew, and the Pentagon told them they would lose day one, but it was a good way for the globalists to launder money and rob the American people and kill a bunch of people.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.261]  Ukraine's on the cusp of losing this war.
[00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:07.162]  We're screwed.
[00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:10.164]  Is this the end for Zelensky?
[00:21:10.184 --> 00:21:11.284]  Yeah, they're getting ready to blame him.
[00:21:11.925 --> 00:21:15.627]  Ukrainian Zelensky to visit Capitol Hill and USA package risk collapse.
[00:21:17.388 --> 00:21:19.209]  He says, no, no, no, we're not going to defend your border.
[00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.390]  Don't pass that.
[00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.351]  No, no, no, Biden.
[00:21:21.691 --> 00:21:23.312]  You know, we're not going to shut down the border either.
[00:21:24.193 --> 00:21:27.595]  Just give us money to keep this war going on forever.
[00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:32.877]  And then here's the big enchilada that I'm going to raise with Jack Posobiec.
[00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.178]  People ask how I know tomorrow's news today.
[00:21:37.219 --> 00:21:51.447]  Because the globalists know statistically since the advent, you can call it that, since the tragedy of television, that the average person is in a near-sleep daydream state.
[00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:53.969]  They're not in it, but they're very highly suggestible.
[00:21:55.816 --> 00:22:00.097]  And the more you watch television, the higher levels of neurological disorders, Alzheimer's, death.
[00:22:00.637 --> 00:22:04.118]  Just type in, watching a lot of television statistically kills you earlier.
[00:22:04.498 --> 00:22:06.158]  Television watching tied to Alzheimer's.
[00:22:06.198 --> 00:22:07.698]  There's literally thousands of studies.
[00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:21.921]  And so, when you see Klaus Schwab say, if you think COVID is bad, wait until there is a cyber attack that will shut down civilization.
[00:22:23.721 --> 00:22:25.402]  So we need global government to stop it.
[00:22:25.442 --> 00:22:28.723]  Meanwhile, he wants to shut down civilization for the general public.
[00:22:28.743 --> 00:22:30.324]  They want to go back to feudalism.
[00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.505]  And that was going on a few years ago.
[00:22:32.545 --> 00:22:34.566]  And I said, they're pre-programming a cyber attack.
[00:22:34.906 --> 00:22:37.427]  They're going to blame it on Russia and claim they're working with domestic groups.
[00:22:37.487 --> 00:22:38.768]  I just saw that in the tea leaves.
[00:22:39.228 --> 00:22:45.591]  And then they came out earlier this year, what in January, now 10 months ago, 11 months ago, and said,
[00:22:46.807 --> 00:22:48.388]  FBI memo with no proof.
[00:22:49.028 --> 00:23:00.754]  The American MAGA movement working with Russia, we already know that's all crap, is going to cyber attack America, probably for the election, to steal it for Trump.
[00:23:00.994 --> 00:23:01.214]  What?
[00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:06.096]  And now Obama's new Netflix show is out.
[00:23:09.998 --> 00:23:11.659]  Leaving the world behind.
[00:23:11.719 --> 00:23:12.599]  Yeah, give up.
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.940]  The world's gonna end.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.241]  Just accept it's your fault.
[00:23:15.301 --> 00:23:15.821]  You're bad.
[00:23:17.702 --> 00:23:21.084]  I haven't seen the show, I've seen the trailer, but the crew, one of the crew saw it.
[00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:30.989]  It's all just the cyber attacks coming, everything's over, dystopia, everybody's cheating on each other, you know, all this, you know, perverts everywhere.
[00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:33.811]  I mean, just, just, just a nasty snake bite.
[00:23:35.512 --> 00:23:36.132]  Just poison.
[00:23:37.112 --> 00:23:43.636]  Obama produced dystopian movie foretells nightmare future after cyber attack collapses civilization.
[00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:46.337]  So the UN officially, Rio de Janeiro 1992,
[00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:54.465]  Once a post-industrial world, and they're telling you everything's shutting down because you're bad.
[00:23:54.505 --> 00:23:56.045]  No, they're cutting all the resources off.
[00:23:57.125 --> 00:24:03.307]  And they've got King Charles saying it, and they've got all the Hollywood, William Shatner out running around doing it.
[00:24:04.087 --> 00:24:07.467]  And now the new Obama show is out.
[00:24:09.027 --> 00:24:14.108]  Obama produced a dystopian movie foretells nightmare future after cyber attack collapses civilization.
[00:24:14.148 --> 00:24:15.229]  And you're like, well, yeah, okay.
[00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:16.769]  And then the WEF
[00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:30.426]  Just had their big meeting after COP 28, and they say imminently, cyber attacks and the power going off.
[00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:37.263]  So I'm going to talk about this with Jack Faso, but in the interest of time, I won't play the clip.
[00:24:37.283 --> 00:24:40.144]  So next hour, I'm going to start with this and give you my analysis.
[00:24:40.164 --> 00:24:44.545]  But this is, they always foretell and pre-program.
[00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:47.465]  Now, if you're not in a trance, you're like, okay, they're getting you ready for it.
[00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:48.546]  Predictive programming.
[00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:53.847]  But if you're in a trance, then you accept it when it happens and who they tell you has done it.
[00:24:54.147 --> 00:24:58.808]  So they're telling the FBI in briefings, men, women, agents of the Bureau,
[00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:09.334]  We've got Intel, it's classified, we can't show it to you, but Trump supporters are going to shut off the power grid and or the internet grid and there'll only be government websites available during this.
[00:25:09.354 --> 00:25:11.855]  That's obviously internet kill switch, coup d'etat move.
[00:25:12.855 --> 00:25:18.638]  But it's not the government seizing power when this happens, it's the Russians with the Trump supporters.
[00:25:18.658 --> 00:25:24.380]  So, what are they going to do about Trump 10, 15, 20 points ahead in different polls?
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.161]  What are they going to do when everybody's waking up?
[00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:28.682]  Well, they'll pull the damn plug.
[00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:34.595]  And Obama got the kill switch in, look it up, I told you about it years before it was official, because I had sources.
[00:25:35.496 --> 00:25:44.845]  And before he left office, Obama got the kill switch in, but what it means is, there'll still be the internet, but cyber attackers from China or Russia, or now, MAGA,
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:26:00.808]  They will use the internet to keep hacking the bridges, and the ferries, and the air traffic controllers, and the gas pipelines, and the highway signs, and the hospital machines, and just total disaster, and they show you all these movies, get ready for it.
[00:26:01.609 --> 00:26:08.933]  But if we cut everybody's internet off, you'll still have internet, but you can only then get approved channels.
[00:26:10.334 --> 00:26:11.214]  And they even war game it.
[00:26:11.254 --> 00:26:12.615]  At first, it's just the White House.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.244]  Your cell phone, your computer, you can't get anything but what they say.
[00:26:21.964 --> 00:26:33.131]  Narrative control, not enough to lock in your house in a lockdown and force feed your brainwashing for years and make you work at home and telecommute so they can spy on what you're doing when you're on the Zoom with their AI.
[00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:34.491]  That was just a war game.
[00:26:35.172 --> 00:26:36.112]  This is total.
[00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:39.314]  And this is what you need to take over the communications during
[00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:42.745]  A soft coup going into a hot coup.
[00:26:43.526 --> 00:26:45.907]  So they're swinging from the chandeliers.
[00:26:45.927 --> 00:26:52.892]  They're running around like chickens with their heads cut off, telling you the cyber attack is imminent.
[00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:57.435]  And with no proof, it's the Russians.
[00:26:58.175 --> 00:27:03.218]  But now they're even saying, oh, China has launched major attacks that are ongoing.
[00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:08.762]  Oh, maybe China ransomed the East Coast pipeline that caught up a few years ago.
[00:27:14.241 --> 00:27:16.922]  But who's really shutting off thousands of pipelines?
[00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:21.062]  Thousands of the spurs and links?
[00:27:21.703 --> 00:27:22.283]  Who won't let us?
[00:27:22.323 --> 00:27:27.924]  Who's trying to shut down the Canadian pipeline we've had since the 70s that supplies most of the central part of the country?
[00:27:29.464 --> 00:27:36.586]  Who shut down the Keystone pipeline that was going to massively cut our gas prices and produce tens of millions of barrels of gasoline a day?
[00:27:38.226 --> 00:27:38.746]  The globalists.
[00:27:39.627 --> 00:27:41.207]  Who's telling you they want to shut off the fuel?
[00:27:42.321 --> 00:27:44.802]  And then they go, oh, it's the Russians, yeah.
[00:27:45.242 --> 00:27:47.343]  Oh, yeah, the Russians blew up Nord Stream 2, right?
[00:27:49.504 --> 00:27:50.544]  No, they didn't.
[00:27:53.366 --> 00:27:54.586]  They didn't blow up Nord Stream 2.
[00:27:54.826 --> 00:27:57.587]  The globalists did.
[00:27:57.987 --> 00:28:05.751]  And if the Russians were doing any of this, I've never been to Russia, I would be their enemy so fast it'd make your head spin.
[00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:07.051]  But that's just not true, folks.
[00:28:08.072 --> 00:28:11.353]  The Russians are the excuse to take use for all this crap.
[00:28:13.268 --> 00:28:14.508]  Did the Russians get rid of our border?
[00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:16.369]  Did the Russians ship in the fentanyl?
[00:28:16.889 --> 00:28:18.669]  Did the Russians have drag queen pedophile time?
[00:28:18.889 --> 00:28:22.190]  Did the Russians put satanic Baphomet idols in the state capitals?
[00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.171]  Did they abort 68 million Americans, half of them black?
[00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:29.011]  Did the Russians ship in the cocaine?
[00:28:29.031 --> 00:28:29.972]  No, that was the CIA.
[00:28:30.592 --> 00:28:34.993]  We have a ruthless, insane group of criminals that have hijacked the government.
[00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:37.533]  And they're destroying the world around us.
[00:28:37.573 --> 00:28:39.914]  And we can stop them because the Great Awakening is here.
[00:28:39.994 --> 00:28:41.134]  So we got a lot on that.
[00:28:42.472 --> 00:28:46.814]  And the WEFO, the imminent attack, it's gonna shut down civilization.
[00:28:47.214 --> 00:28:49.755]  Meanwhile, we have IMF, World Bank, WEF videos.
[00:28:49.975 --> 00:28:56.537]  How great it was during a lockdown, how good it was for the Earth, and we need more lockdowns, but those damn Russians are gonna put us in a lockdown!
[00:28:56.557 --> 00:29:02.900]  When I say this, I mean it from the very bottom of my heart.
[00:29:04.062 --> 00:29:08.186]  I want to say thank you to all the viewers and listeners for supporting the broadcast over the years.
[00:29:08.667 --> 00:29:15.154]  We together have changed the world at an incredible level and I want to salute the crew as well and all of our sponsors and supporters.
[00:29:15.594 --> 00:29:19.618]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the fight has really been joined with a globalist.
[00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:28.144]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[00:29:28.164 --> 00:29:29.845]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:31.426]  Keep sharing the articles and videos.
[00:29:31.826 --> 00:29:34.727]  Keep praying for the broadcast and our reporters and the crew.
[00:29:35.108 --> 00:29:42.272]  And shop at infowarestore.com, where for Christmas, we have the biggest sales of the year, double Patriot points, store-wide free shipping,

[00:30:00.343 --> 00:30:03.584]  If you ever take one piece of my advice,
[00:30:04.585 --> 00:30:05.786]  It's got a bottle of X2.
[00:30:06.547 --> 00:30:10.831]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:15.695]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at infowarestore.com.
[00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:19.838]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:30:20.099 --> 00:30:21.220]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.085]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.007]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or
[00:30:30.868 --> 00:30:33.029]  Bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:38.631]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[00:30:39.211 --> 00:30:42.313]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:45.814]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[00:30:46.154 --> 00:30:51.256]  It funds the Infowar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:52.217]  It is amazing.
[00:30:52.537 --> 00:30:54.178]  It's the Missing Link X2.
[00:30:54.658 --> 00:30:56.579]  Back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfowarStore.com.
[00:30:56.599 --> 00:30:56.619]  X2.
[00:31:00.493 --> 00:31:14.148]  Finally, after close to a year, in early November, where I'm cutting this ad, we finally got one of our flagship products back in stock, Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 organic.
[00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:19.654]  You take it out of the tongue, so you get better absorption of the body through your blood vessels, and what it does,
[00:31:19.974 --> 00:31:20.274]  We're good.
[00:31:38.135 --> 00:31:43.119]  It's available from a top lab that we private label it through at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:51.385]  Ultra 12, vitamin B12, taken sublingually, now back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:53.967]  Or you can call toll free and order it as well, 888-253-3139.
[00:31:54.088 --> 00:31:55.589]  And Ultra 12 funds the InfoWar as well.
[00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:04.397]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned!

[00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:11.703]  Oh, yeah.
[00:33:21.297 --> 00:33:23.419]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:29.085]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:47.777 --> 00:33:48.858]  Tuesday Live!
[00:33:48.978 --> 00:33:49.659]  It's official.
[00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:52.521]  New World Order puppet Zelensky has officially lost the war.
[00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:58.146]  Globalists prepare to trigger massive cyber attacks to accelerate planetary destabilization.
[00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:02.189]  And when you read the Drudge Report headlines, Z for defeat.
[00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.271]  Biden AIDS package risk collapse.
[00:34:05.392 --> 00:34:08.094]  Ukraine on cusp of losing the war.
[00:34:08.114 --> 00:34:10.476]  Here's the headline here before Drudge changed it.
[00:34:11.724 --> 00:34:12.445]  A little while ago.
[00:34:12.905 --> 00:34:18.649]  So Jack Posobiec, former Naval Intelligence, great patriot, one of the most prolific journalists, the smartest people out there about what's happening.
[00:34:18.709 --> 00:34:21.190]  I wanted to get you on and ask you to come on this morning.
[00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.491]  We were talking at like 6 a.m.
[00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:29.416]  via text about we're talking about devil worshipers, how they're out in the open, how it's a fight between good versus evil, a spiritual war.
[00:34:29.436 --> 00:34:30.656]  We were going to talk about that.
[00:34:30.697 --> 00:34:31.377]  We'll do that in a minute.
[00:34:31.777 --> 00:34:32.318]  But first,
[00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:47.835]  When you've got Drudge, which we now know got leased off to the Globalist, the mouth of the establishment, and I love Drudge so much for the great work he did, it's hard to even say that, it's just true, when the mouth of Soron is saying it's Zelensky lost, that's
[00:34:48.175 --> 00:34:55.139]  They're trying to set him up now, as you said yesterday, as the fall guy for NATO's failure, because they never want to admit they got defeated.
[00:34:55.599 --> 00:35:01.502]  Now they're admitting that Zelensky got defeated, though the Secretary of Defense says they're going to triple munitions.
[00:35:01.862 --> 00:35:11.527]  They said it's going to be a 10-year war, but if they can't get Ukrainians to go fight it, even if there's plenty of money, if all the Ukrainian men who can fight are dead, then it's checkmate unless U.S.
[00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:12.127]  troops go in.
[00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:15.769]  That's a lot, Jack Passova, but give us your gestalt on that.
[00:35:16.929 --> 00:35:20.854]  No, Alex, I mean, look, this is what you and I discussed yesterday here on the program.
[00:35:21.314 --> 00:35:30.645]  When you look at that Drudge headline, and if the team can pull that up again, go look at the Drudge headline right now, because Drudge has really become this mouth of the globalists.
[00:35:30.665 --> 00:35:31.225]  There you go.
[00:35:32.006 --> 00:35:35.090]  What you're looking at is the three-act movie.
[00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.734]  The three-act movie of the first act, Russia has invaded the hero, right?
[00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:45.097]  The hero's journey, Joseph Campbell, they're deprogramming Joseph Campbell on the American people.
[00:35:45.137 --> 00:35:47.939]  So they're running this play for the media psyop of this.
[00:35:47.959 --> 00:35:51.942]  You gotta understand, 4G warfare, 5G warfare, this is exactly what they preach.
[00:35:52.222 --> 00:35:53.623]  So they're giving you a movie.
[00:35:53.663 --> 00:35:56.945]  You're watching a narrative unfold in real time, folks.
[00:35:57.246 --> 00:35:58.707]  This is like WWE.
[00:35:58.827 --> 00:35:59.947]  It's all pre-planned.
[00:36:00.288 --> 00:36:00.428]  So,
[00:36:01.016 --> 00:36:02.077]  Russia invades, right?
[00:36:02.097 --> 00:36:04.479]  That was instigated by NATO expansion and the Maidan coup.
[00:36:04.519 --> 00:36:05.059]  We know this.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.221]  Number two, Zelensky becomes the hero.
[00:36:07.241 --> 00:36:10.964]  Remember, Zelensky was the bad guy in the Trump impeachment, but we don't talk about that anymore.
[00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:14.747]  Remember, it was Zelensky and Trump and Ukraine collusion, and then he was the bad guy.
[00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:17.770]  This was just a couple of years ago, and Trump gets impeached over that.
[00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:21.413]  The very first call was with the same Zelensky, but we don't talk about that anymore.
[00:36:21.773 --> 00:36:23.214]  Now, Zelensky is the hero.
[00:36:23.274 --> 00:36:24.175]  He grows the beard.
[00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:28.732]  He goes out there, stands with his people, he becomes the hero of everything.
[00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:30.834]  But now suddenly you enter Act 2.
[00:36:31.195 --> 00:36:32.956]  And Act 2, this is the fall.
[00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:36.099]  This is when it looks like everything is lost.
[00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:44.687]  It's, you know, you've lost the crown, Han Solo is frozen in carbonite, Luke gets his hand cut off, Princess Leia gets captured by Jabba the Hutt.
[00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:46.829]  This is Empire Strikes Back.
[00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:50.761]  And then, of course, the classic Act 3, the redemptive story.
[00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:52.001]  That's what they're looking for.
[00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:55.303]  So they're playing on these preset narratives that have existed.
[00:36:55.323 --> 00:36:56.243]  This is the monomyth.
[00:36:56.263 --> 00:37:05.987]  This has existed for thousands of years in Western culture that they are trying to run Zelinsky through this to rally people and rally support to his side.
[00:37:06.367 --> 00:37:09.149]  And, of course, what's the next step of that, Alex?
[00:37:09.209 --> 00:37:09.829]  The next step?
[00:37:10.273 --> 00:37:14.997]  Is the return of the Death Star an even stronger and more powerful Death Star?
[00:37:15.077 --> 00:37:16.058]  And what do we have here?
[00:37:16.478 --> 00:37:19.881]  Well, the massive cyberattacks that are going on in Ukraine that are happening.
[00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:34.794]  Of course, Russia is conducting cyberattacks along with their Connecticut attacks, but they're also saying, and the FBI has already started seeding this narrative through predictive programming, that Russia and MAGA will work together to commit cyberattacks in the United States
[00:37:35.794 --> 00:37:35.854]  In
[00:37:54.284 --> 00:37:54.964]  I don't think so.
[00:38:13.129 --> 00:38:15.491]  They will take your voting rights away through this.
[00:38:15.712 --> 00:38:19.515]  They're going to take your ability away to vote for Trump by kicking him off the ballot.
[00:38:19.756 --> 00:38:21.617]  Then they want to go after people, Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:38:21.637 --> 00:38:22.658]  They try to do this in Georgia.
[00:38:22.678 --> 00:38:25.101]  They'll try to do it to anybody else connected to these things.
[00:38:25.421 --> 00:38:27.703]  And then if you're just a regular voter, guess what?
[00:38:28.004 --> 00:38:29.265]  They can put you up for Jan 6.
[00:38:29.405 --> 00:38:30.766]  Now they can make you a felon.
[00:38:30.926 --> 00:38:32.328]  Now they've got your voting rights.
[00:38:32.348 --> 00:38:33.689]  They'll take your voting rights away.
[00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.952]  Oh, the election's going on.
[00:38:36.372 --> 00:38:43.642]  The election is perfectly fine, but you can't vote in the election, or you can only vote for the candidates that we have approved.
[00:38:44.042 --> 00:38:48.608]  This is the way that they will stop the 2024 election from taking place.
[00:38:48.668 --> 00:38:50.551]  This is a free stand-up election.
[00:38:51.053 --> 00:38:56.338]  A free Senate election where people go to vote and the amount of people that go to vote determines who the winner is.
[00:38:56.658 --> 00:38:57.619]  We know that Trump would win.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:02.664]  We know that the populist uprising and the populist uprising against the globalists in this nation would win out.
[00:39:02.704 --> 00:39:07.589]  So that is why they're tying everything from Zelensky to Ukraine to cyber.
[00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:11.452]  Probably even China will come up at some point and then they'll throw Taiwan on top of the pot.
[00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:13.326]  to go.
[00:39:29.085 --> 00:39:31.787]  We just found out that information a few moments ago.
[00:39:31.847 --> 00:39:33.868]  We're working that on HumanEvents.com.
[00:39:33.888 --> 00:39:34.749]  People can go and see that.
[00:39:34.769 --> 00:39:36.350]  We're going to be covering it later in the show today.
[00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:41.974]  So, Alex, I just threw out a lot of stuff there, but I want people to be very cognizant of the dangerous times we live in.
[00:39:42.054 --> 00:39:45.096]  They want you to think that everything is over.
[00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:49.158]  They want it to look like a dire situation, a desperate situation, and then what will they do?
[00:39:49.438 --> 00:39:52.100]  Then the Hail Marys come out, the desperation plays.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.564]  This is a three-act play, a manufactured narrative, and they're playing with the lives of us,
[00:39:57.965 --> 00:40:00.857]  Of our sons and daughters and everyone that we love and hold dear.
[00:40:01.696 --> 00:40:05.719]  I totally agree with you, and again, they just repeat this.
[00:40:05.759 --> 00:40:10.442]  Just like, oh, the summer offensive six, eight months ago.
[00:40:10.603 --> 00:40:11.763]  Oh, it was going to be unstoppable.
[00:40:12.044 --> 00:40:13.345]  It was defeated the first week.
[00:40:13.905 --> 00:40:18.989]  Half the weapons and armor got destroyed in just the first month, and then everything else got destroyed.
[00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.150]  We saw the footage we showed yesterday.
[00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:20.770]  We'll play it again.
[00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.912]  The average conscript now is like 65 years old.
[00:40:24.313 --> 00:40:28.115]  These are men knowing they're attending their own funerals, and then that
[00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:31.818]  Alex, it's not just that, because you know what else they're going for?
[00:40:31.838 --> 00:40:32.618]  And it just occurred to me.
[00:40:32.638 --> 00:40:33.999]  Because they think in terms of movies, right?
[00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:35.580]  I'm not saying it should be this way.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.941]  They think in terms of Star Wars.
[00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:55.352]  Decades ago, there's a whole office, as you said, that does this, not just in the Pentagon, but the CIA.
[00:40:55.772 --> 00:41:08.262]  They go and pay top movie writers to then write them scenarios, and that way when other agencies watch it, they don't know it's actually a battle plan, they'll then use a real-world scenario written by a top script writer as the real blueprint.
[00:41:08.282 --> 00:41:08.642]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.160]  That's exactly right.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.242]  And so what is the end of the Avengers, Alex?
[00:41:12.302 --> 00:41:13.283]  What's the end of Avengers?
[00:41:13.543 --> 00:41:15.224]  That's all the Avengers getting together.
[00:41:15.364 --> 00:41:16.125]  Everyone comes in.
[00:41:16.165 --> 00:41:19.847]  You didn't think they were going to come, or even you thought they were killed, and now they come back to life.
[00:41:20.107 --> 00:41:21.468]  So what's the Avengers in this case?
[00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:25.411]  The entry of NATO into the war.
[00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.572]  And I'm not saying it.
[00:41:26.872 --> 00:41:27.592]  You know who's saying it?
[00:41:27.993 --> 00:41:28.813]  Lloyd Austin.
[00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:30.394]  Joe Biden.
[00:41:30.975 --> 00:41:34.297]  Threatening, going to those lawmakers to say, if you don't pay for this,
[00:41:34.932 --> 00:41:36.994]  Then your sons and daughters will be sent to fight.
[00:41:37.354 --> 00:41:43.980]  Then Joe Biden saying if Russia crosses one line, then the full force of NATO will be deployed against them.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.201]  That's the only play.
[00:41:45.221 --> 00:41:50.446]  They're setting up the desperation play, right, on one hand to say Ukraine can't do it by their own.
[00:41:50.486 --> 00:41:51.046]  We have to win.
[00:41:51.066 --> 00:41:52.287]  We have to defend democracy.
[00:41:52.568 --> 00:41:56.431]  And then they will come in and say there's an attack and they will say NATO has been attacked by Russia.
[00:41:56.711 --> 00:41:59.734]  And they will say that that is why NATO has to come.
[00:41:59.774 --> 00:42:01.836]  And guess what, boys and girls, that means
[00:42:06.092 --> 00:42:06.733]  Jack, hold on.
[00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:08.174]  Jack, hold on.
[00:42:08.254 --> 00:42:10.736]  Stop, stop.
[00:42:11.057 --> 00:42:11.537]  Jack, hold on.
[00:42:11.857 --> 00:42:14.079]  Your Skype at the key point went out for about five seconds.
[00:42:14.099 --> 00:42:14.680]  It never goes out.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.401]  But what you're saying is so key.
[00:42:16.862 --> 00:42:18.223]  Nothing you're saying is your opinion.
[00:42:18.704 --> 00:42:20.325]  We have the puppet president.
[00:42:20.345 --> 00:42:21.506]  We have the Secretary of Defense.
[00:42:21.766 --> 00:42:22.867]  We have the Secretary of State.
[00:42:22.887 --> 00:42:26.010]  We have these top generals saying, within months, U.S.
[00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.492]  troops will die if you don't give us money.
[00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:33.413]  Then Congress doesn't give them the money, missiles get launched into Poland, or, you know, who knows this time.
[00:42:33.853 --> 00:42:35.014]  Oh my God, Russia did it.
[00:42:35.374 --> 00:42:36.314]  It's a cyber attack.
[00:42:36.614 --> 00:42:37.514]  It's your fault.
[00:42:38.114 --> 00:42:41.215]  Now we've got to just go ahead and have NATO go in.
[00:42:41.535 --> 00:42:46.456]  So your Skype cut out, but that is so, this isn't a game.
[00:42:46.896 --> 00:42:54.478]  For you and I that are informed and awake and understand the stuff that you were in Naval Intelligence and China and everywhere else, and you weren't just like some side intelligence guy, you're a really smart guy.
[00:42:54.498 --> 00:42:55.358]  We want people to know that.
[00:42:55.899 --> 00:42:57.299]  We know how the enemy operates.
[00:42:57.839 --> 00:43:12.924]  They want to sell us fantasy land, but the script is they're doing this, the bone chilling magnitude of having Biden two weeks ago and Austin a week ago and now all of them this week saying, no, we're going to war with Russia and trying to sell that narrative.
[00:43:13.204 --> 00:43:15.605]  They should all be locked up in padded rooms right now.
[00:43:15.645 --> 00:43:16.125]  Please continue.
[00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:24.149]  Well, Alex, and this is why it's become so dangerous, because to them, the expansion of NATO, the entry of NATO, they understand.
[00:43:24.169 --> 00:43:29.857]  Look, when they're looking at it, Alex, they don't actually think that Zelensky and Ukraine can win this on their own.
[00:43:29.897 --> 00:43:30.398]  They know that.
[00:43:31.246 --> 00:43:37.533]  But remember, as Julian Assange taught us, the goal of the war is not to win, the goal of the war is to be continuous.
[00:43:37.873 --> 00:43:40.596]  The goal of the war is to continue the war on.
[00:43:40.917 --> 00:43:44.000]  Their goal here is regime change in Russia.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:50.147]  And the only way that they can continue this, because they've already destroyed, and you and I spoke to Elon Musk about this,
[00:43:50.847 --> 00:43:54.609]  Uh, on Sunday night, and he talked about it, they've already destroyed the flower of Ukrainian youth.
[00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:55.110]  Right?
[00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:02.694]  That country, or whatever's left of Ukraine, the dysfunctional, rump state that Ukraine will become at the end of this, they don't care about that.
[00:44:02.994 --> 00:44:06.376]  They don't care about- Remember, Lloyd Austin said at the beginning, this is great.
[00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:07.056]  No, they don't care.
[00:44:07.176 --> 00:44:08.257]  We're gonna degrade Russia.
[00:44:08.297 --> 00:44:09.297]  They admitted day one.
[00:44:09.537 --> 00:44:11.138]  This is about degrading Russia.
[00:44:11.158 --> 00:44:12.159]  Ukraine would never win.
[00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:14.240]  The Washington Post, the Washington Post said,
[00:44:15.542 --> 00:44:24.743]  That all of the objectives are being achieved, and it's actually been a huge success, and then in very small print, except of course for the Ukrainians.
[00:44:25.322 --> 00:44:27.184]  Except, of course, for the Ukrainian people.
[00:44:27.404 --> 00:44:28.104]  So guess what?
[00:44:28.765 --> 00:44:29.786]  Who's next on the block?
[00:44:29.906 --> 00:44:31.007]  It's going to be NATO troops.
[00:44:31.167 --> 00:44:32.428]  It's going to be NATO forces.
[00:44:32.648 --> 00:44:34.189]  They might try to get the Poles involved.
[00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:37.732]  They might try to get other forces from Lithuania, maybe get the Germans.
[00:44:38.232 --> 00:44:39.873]  Finland is now talking about joining NATO.
[00:44:40.214 --> 00:44:45.258]  And so, of course, but we all know that the majority of NATO would be American troops.
[00:44:45.358 --> 00:44:46.699]  And guess what, boys and girls?
[00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:51.202]  There's already American troops that are situated right there in Europe right now.
[00:44:51.242 --> 00:44:52.183]  Those are not boys and girls.
[00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:55.425]  And Jack, we know, because I know people very close to me, they don't give me the details, but...
[00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:09.337]  Yeah, juniors in Poland.
[00:45:09.397 --> 00:45:09.937]  Wink, wink.
[00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:10.938]  This is a year and a half ago.
[00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:16.422]  So I've got people very close to me that are in army special operations and stuff and like, you know, we're waiting.
[00:45:16.462 --> 00:45:17.723]  Hopefully he comes back for Thanksgiving.
[00:45:17.763 --> 00:45:18.644]  Hopefully he doesn't get killed.
[00:45:18.664 --> 00:45:19.365]  And it's like, well, where is he?
[00:45:19.385 --> 00:45:20.886]  And they're like, where do you think he is?
[00:45:21.286 --> 00:45:23.168]  I know some other guys whose sons are over there.
[00:45:23.468 --> 00:45:24.208]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:45:24.248 --> 00:45:27.011]  This goes back years even before this started.
[00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:31.054]  But they're sheep-dipped as contractors and liaisons with NATO.
[00:45:31.074 --> 00:45:33.276]  So how do they roll out the false flag?
[00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:34.777]  What type of false flag?
[00:45:35.317 --> 00:45:37.119]  How do we stop it?
[00:45:37.219 --> 00:45:45.488]  When those leaked documents came out from that National Guard and National Air Guardsman up in Massachusetts, they told us that special forces are already all over Ukraine.
[00:45:45.929 --> 00:45:46.690]  All over Ukraine.
[00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:52.576]  And when I was in Ukraine, when I met with people, they said, yeah, we've got American forces here, we've got special forces, CIA, we've got everyone soft.
[00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.517]  That they've been in Ukraine since day one.
[00:45:54.537 --> 00:45:55.658]  Since before day one.
[00:45:55.918 --> 00:45:57.099]  They were all over Ukraine.
[00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:58.620]  So of course we're going to put people in there.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.481]  And then what happens, right?
[00:46:00.782 --> 00:46:01.522]  What happens, Alex?
[00:46:01.542 --> 00:46:07.747]  Then they say something goes wrong and then we hear in the press that, oh, there was a helicopter accident.
[00:46:07.827 --> 00:46:11.229]  Or there was a very sad training situation that went bad.
[00:46:11.249 --> 00:46:13.631]  Oh, some Delta Force guys crashing a Black Hawk in the Mediterranean.
[00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:15.992]  Just happened to be in the Mediterranean.
[00:46:16.032 --> 00:46:17.954]  Which was, I think, more related to Hamas.
[00:46:17.974 --> 00:46:18.834]  But you get what I'm saying.
[00:46:19.135 --> 00:46:22.377]  That the helicopter crash will be used as a cover
[00:46:22.777 --> 00:46:33.090]  for something that went sideways on people on a mission on the ground in a theater that we do not want to acknowledge that American Special Forces are currently operating.
[00:46:33.371 --> 00:46:33.891]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:33.951 --> 00:46:35.033]  So, and that's all come out.
[00:46:35.073 --> 00:46:35.814]  So, so let's talk.
[00:46:36.595 --> 00:46:38.097]  What type of false flag do you think they'll use?
[00:46:38.437 --> 00:46:41.281]  Let's put a bow on that and move on to the open devil worship here in America.
[00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:47.733]  Well look, Alex, we said before that Kinetic would obviously be the strongest.
[00:46:47.773 --> 00:46:49.494]  We've seen these Kinetic false flag attacks.
[00:46:49.894 --> 00:46:59.138]  They've just conducted a massive false flag economic attack and also environmental attack on Nord Stream 2, which was an energy project between Russia and Germany.
[00:46:59.218 --> 00:47:01.539]  Germany, by the way, which is a NATO country.
[00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:02.959]  Which is a NATO country.
[00:47:02.999 --> 00:47:04.120]  Now they're blaming it on
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:16.122]  The Ukrainians, and so they're trying to get out of it, but if you want me to believe that the CIA and MI6 played no role in that, or no role in that whatsoever, then you know what?
[00:47:16.142 --> 00:47:17.782]  I got a hard drive to sell you, right?
[00:47:17.862 --> 00:47:21.403]  I got some Russian spies to sell you, because this is ridiculous.
[00:47:21.523 --> 00:47:28.624]  Of course Western intelligence played a role in the bombing of Nord Stream 2, and they used it as a false flag to blame on Russia.
[00:47:28.644 --> 00:47:30.784]  So that's number one, kinetic false flag attack.
[00:47:31.085 --> 00:47:33.725]  Number two is one of these cyber attacks, the same way
[00:47:35.025 --> 00:47:56.634]  That we had a cyber attack in 2016, which was used politically here in the United States, domestically, to blame Trump, blame all Trump supporters, say, you hacked the DNC when we know that it was Wikileaks and they were never able to definitively prove what happened there, and they blamed that cyber attack on Russia, and they said that you were doing it in conjunction with them.
[00:47:56.934 --> 00:48:03.537]  Roger Stone, they tried to put him in jail over this, they tried to put Steve Bannon in jail over this, they tried to go after you, Alex, regarding this.
[00:48:03.877 --> 00:48:07.658]  That was a cyber attack that was blamed on Russia.
[00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:12.319]  So this already happened the last cycle when we weren't all... That's what I was about to say!
[00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:16.020]  They're just replaying... It's already happened once.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.181]  2016, 17, 18, where, oh, Trump stopped a Russian cyber attack.
[00:48:19.381 --> 00:48:20.581]  They're getting ready to run it again.
[00:48:20.742 --> 00:48:22.242]  Why do they run the same place?
[00:48:24.124 --> 00:48:25.945]  Well, they have so much invested in this, Alex.
[00:48:25.985 --> 00:48:27.626]  Well, number one, they have so much invested in this.
[00:48:27.946 --> 00:48:31.468]  Number two, it's because they are completely obsessed with Russia.
[00:48:31.728 --> 00:48:34.089]  They are just utterly, utterly obsessed with Russia.
[00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:37.351]  Russia, it did not threaten the United States.
[00:48:37.411 --> 00:48:39.352]  It did not pose a threat to the United States.
[00:48:39.712 --> 00:48:41.493]  It has never attacked the United States.
[00:48:42.306 --> 00:48:48.309]  They viewed this as an existential enemy because it is their existential enemy in their writings, in their ideology.
[00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:49.169]  You and I talked about this.
[00:48:49.189 --> 00:48:56.192]  Whether you're Aesop or whether you're Trotskyites that make up so much of our elite, they have a heart on because they got their ass kicked.
[00:48:57.293 --> 00:49:02.715]  Yeah, for 80 years they want to get rid of the regime that's in Russia and they want control of this massive state.
[00:49:03.171 --> 00:49:03.351]  This is
[00:49:18.493 --> 00:49:21.375]  He's signing military deals with Iran, and then what is it?
[00:49:21.455 --> 00:49:23.016]  The rise of the BRICS nations.
[00:49:23.376 --> 00:49:31.402]  They do not want BRICS to be able to rise, to exist as a parallel track to what they want their one world financial order.
[00:49:31.462 --> 00:49:34.684]  And let me add this, let me add this, Jack.
[00:49:34.944 --> 00:49:36.666]  Why did Napoleon invade Russia?
[00:49:37.086 --> 00:49:42.069]  Because Russia didn't do a trade deal with France, instead they did it with England.
[00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:44.171]  It's the same damn thing over and over again.
[00:49:45.397 --> 00:49:46.438]  It's imperial trade.
[00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:49.259]  It was the centralised imperial trade of the time.
[00:49:49.899 --> 00:49:50.880]  It was France.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.961]  Now we talk about it more in terms of Brussels.
[00:49:53.041 --> 00:49:54.582]  It's a bit more decentralised.
[00:49:54.642 --> 00:49:55.562]  It's not nationalised.
[00:49:55.862 --> 00:49:57.203]  But of course, many people could focus on that.
[00:49:57.343 --> 00:50:03.006]  Obviously, Germany is one of the highest central powers of the EU in terms of that.
[00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:05.507]  But really, what you have is this Atlanticist axis.
[00:50:06.587 --> 00:50:07.348]  It's the UK.
[00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:08.904]  It's the United States.
[00:50:09.164 --> 00:50:11.926]  They are driving the globalist American empire.
[00:50:11.966 --> 00:50:12.846]  They are driving it.
[00:50:13.126 --> 00:50:15.247]  So they are in conjunction, Klaus Schwab, WABF.
[00:50:15.767 --> 00:50:19.349]  And by the way, Alex, people say, you're just making this up.
[00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:20.709]  Where did Zelensky go yesterday?
[00:50:20.749 --> 00:50:21.850]  Two places he went yesterday.
[00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:24.371]  Two places he went yesterday here in Washington, D.C.
[00:50:24.391 --> 00:50:27.372]  The first was to the military.
[00:50:27.452 --> 00:50:28.212]  He spoke to the U.S.
[00:50:28.232 --> 00:50:28.552]  military.
[00:50:28.572 --> 00:50:29.253]  He said, I want the U.S.
[00:50:29.273 --> 00:50:30.113]  military to come fight.
[00:50:30.782 --> 00:50:35.766]  And then the second place he went to, I'm talking other than Congress, second place he went to, Alex, the World Bank.
[00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.687]  Second place he went to was the World Bank.
[00:50:38.007 --> 00:50:38.608]  So it's right there.
[00:50:38.768 --> 00:50:39.308]  It's right now.
[00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:40.029]  Let's explain.
[00:50:40.509 --> 00:50:42.170]  For those that don't know.
[00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:51.156]  And I want to get, before we run here, I really want to hit the fact that, and we talked about this yesterday, that if you don't believe that there are satanic forces at work, then you're not paying attention.
[00:50:51.697 --> 00:50:56.160]  And this, when you and I were speaking, I didn't even know about this.
[00:50:56.837 --> 00:51:07.644]  Satanic display that is currently publicly being supported by the government of Iowa, which is a Republican conservative government.
[00:51:07.704 --> 00:51:12.587]  Governor Kim Reynolds, the Republicans in the state legislature, they are allowing this.
[00:51:12.627 --> 00:51:15.989]  They are currently allowing this, which is not a religion, by the way.
[00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:18.711]  The Temple of Satan will even tell you that they're not a religion.
[00:51:18.791 --> 00:51:21.293]  They're saying, oh no, First Amendment, we gotta put it up.
[00:51:21.633 --> 00:51:22.854]  Gotta put up Bamafet.
[00:51:23.034 --> 00:51:24.475]  That is a ritual altar.
[00:51:25.197 --> 00:51:29.640]  To the pagan idol, Bamafet, who is one of the lieutenants of Satan in hell.
[00:51:30.961 --> 00:51:34.443]  And I want to get back to that in the few minutes we have, but just back to this issue.
[00:51:34.823 --> 00:51:37.465]  And I'm not just talking about Napoleon, because the new movie's out, and by the way, it's excellent.
[00:51:38.445 --> 00:51:53.055]  If you study globalists, Zbigniew Brzezinski, all of it, they'll tell you a bigger event than Bretton Woods and the dollar becoming the world currency after World War II was the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 there, when the Prussian
[00:51:54.045 --> 00:51:59.986]  British Pinscher attack finally defeated Napoleon for the second time, then he was exiled to the South Atlantic.
[00:52:01.547 --> 00:52:11.749]  They admit that from that point on, the British Empire became dominant worldwide, and they're still defending, though it's merged with the American Empire, they're still defending that from 1215.
[00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:18.631]  And that's why Russia and all these people have to be gotten rid of, is because they're literally trying to open up new trade since 1815.
[00:52:21.685 --> 00:52:31.853]  This has been, that was the collapse of the French Empire on the continent and since then the Anglo, so it really was the Anglo Empire, the British Empire, now it's become the Anglo-American Empire.
[00:52:32.153 --> 00:52:47.425]  They seek dominance over, and by the way, I would argue currently do have the vast degree of influence over European governments all the way up to the border of Russia at this point on the continent of Europe.
[00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:48.646]  And that's the new world order!
[00:52:48.826 --> 00:52:49.186]  That's the...
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:04.780]  Bingo!
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.022]  And so you totally got it.
[00:53:06.422 --> 00:53:07.903]  What you're hearing is how the world really works.
[00:53:07.963 --> 00:53:09.905]  It's not the British run things or Americans do.
[00:53:10.446 --> 00:53:18.473]  Our power was parlayed into a global corporate system out of the British East India Company, out of 1815, out of all of this, and that's the dominant force.
[00:53:18.533 --> 00:53:24.359]  It is the monopole, and it's against everybody, and it's against free market, and it's crony capitalism at best.
[00:53:24.519 --> 00:53:25.940]  Well, and Alex, people are saying that
[00:53:26.661 --> 00:53:27.001]  We're good to go.
[00:53:44.946 --> 00:53:48.689]  And you've got the GMOs and everybody's running into Ukraine right now.
[00:53:48.709 --> 00:53:49.669]  They want that black dirt.
[00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.531]  They want that dirt there.
[00:53:51.571 --> 00:53:52.451]  Because why, Alex?
[00:53:52.491 --> 00:53:53.192]  It's very simple.
[00:53:53.632 --> 00:53:56.274]  Because Ukraine is not part of the EU.
[00:53:56.294 --> 00:54:00.057]  They're not under European Union regulations.
[00:54:00.217 --> 00:54:01.038]  It's an open zone.
[00:54:01.058 --> 00:54:02.359]  The GMOs can be built there.
[00:54:02.419 --> 00:54:07.042]  Now you've got the child trafficking, the baby incubators, the surrogates.
[00:54:07.462 --> 00:54:08.323]  But anything you want.
[00:54:08.483 --> 00:54:09.924]  It is the globalist playground.
[00:54:10.104 --> 00:54:11.145]  The globalist playground.
[00:54:11.585 --> 00:54:19.774]  Right there in Ukraine, and it has been for a long time, they want Russia to be an even bigger one because Russia stands as an existential threat to all of that.
[00:54:20.114 --> 00:54:22.617]  Back to the devil worshippers and you gotta go and I don't even get to set the news.
[00:54:23.775 --> 00:54:29.137]  We're on the air saying it's a spiritual battle and they wrecked Baphomet and even Christian pastors say, well, it's okay, it's their free speech.
[00:54:29.637 --> 00:54:32.899]  The point is, is that they're playing their flag, they're pissing on us.
[00:54:33.479 --> 00:54:34.820]  And you put a great point out.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.241]  They've taken down George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and even Teddy Roosevelt statues.
[00:54:39.642 --> 00:54:42.703]  And now, so they can take those down, people can say those are unacceptable.
[00:54:43.749 --> 00:54:54.057]  But, those are obscene, but then, a god that children are sacrificed to on Black Sabbath, where children are bled out and raped, that's what happens with Batman, that's okay.
[00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:55.217]  Let that sink in.
[00:54:55.277 --> 00:54:55.798]  Final comment.
[00:54:57.062 --> 00:55:17.314]  The fact that you have a lack of Republican leadership in the state of Iowa and anywhere that would allow something like this to go on shows the absolute rot that has made its way through the Republican movement, the conservative movement, this is why so many people turn away from Republicans, and this is why, Alex, that you are seeing people who
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.241]  May not be the best Christians in the world.
[00:55:20.261 --> 00:55:31.247]  I don't consider myself the best Christian in the world, but you see people who are at least trying to tap into the spiritual elements, the spiritual energy, the spiritual warfare that is currently going on.
[00:55:31.287 --> 00:55:32.567]  We are reading Ephesians.
[00:55:32.607 --> 00:55:35.789]  We are understanding that we are in a spiritual battle.
[00:55:36.169 --> 00:55:37.530]  with these principalities.
[00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:44.015]  We are putting on the spiritual armor and we understand what is actually at stake here.
[00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:45.416]  This is a false religion.
[00:55:45.436 --> 00:55:51.341]  The founders that wrote the First Amendment would be aghast at us for allowing something like this.
[00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:56.145]  And by the way, because this is a state government, not the federal government, the state government can determine whatever
[00:55:56.445 --> 00:55:56.826]  We're good.
[00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:14.951]  I'm calling on the police because I know this group.
[00:56:15.011 --> 00:56:15.572]  I've tracked them.
[00:56:16.252 --> 00:56:17.513]  They're real devil worshippers.
[00:56:17.994 --> 00:56:19.935]  All they got to do is investigate them.
[00:56:19.955 --> 00:56:21.296]  They're going to find really bad stuff.
[00:56:22.057 --> 00:56:23.898]  And we need to see their hard drives.
[00:56:24.099 --> 00:56:26.020]  And it's time to take this group out.
[00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:27.661]  Legally lawfully.
[00:56:27.722 --> 00:56:29.163]  They're going to find out who's funding them.
[00:56:29.403 --> 00:56:31.084]  Find out where their money's coming from.
[00:56:31.364 --> 00:56:32.605]  Find out where it's coming from.
[00:56:32.665 --> 00:56:34.687]  Find out what other activities these people are into.
[00:56:34.727 --> 00:56:36.088]  These people are disgusting.
[00:56:36.408 --> 00:56:39.851]  These people are putting up ritual altars in your areas.
[00:56:39.891 --> 00:56:40.892]  That's what the left is doing.
[00:56:42.005 --> 00:56:44.206]  The right is sitting back and saying, oh we have to do it.
[00:56:44.226 --> 00:56:45.327]  We have to be tolerant.
[00:56:45.547 --> 00:56:46.607]  We have to be loving.
[00:56:46.827 --> 00:56:47.888]  We will be cursed.
[00:56:47.908 --> 00:56:50.108]  We will lose the blessing if we allow this.
[00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:51.749]  It's not about free speech.
[00:56:51.769 --> 00:56:53.230]  They've taken down our presidents.
[00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:56.211]  They can do that, but we can't.
[00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:59.452]  No, they can have their stupid altars at their filthy houses.
[00:56:59.872 --> 00:57:00.733]  They're not going to have it there.
[00:57:00.793 --> 00:57:04.314]  The same group says aborting babies is a religious sacrament in federal court cases.
[00:57:04.634 --> 00:57:05.715]  Jack Posobiec, God bless you.
[00:57:05.735 --> 00:57:07.756]  We're going to post this to X. Thank you so much.
[00:57:08.756 --> 00:57:08.956]  All right.

[00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:56.959]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:58:57.359 --> 00:59:01.843]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:59:02.463 --> 00:59:04.605]  But we're not just exposing their operation.

[00:59:19.718 --> 00:59:23.242]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.

[01:00:00.715 --> 01:00:06.617]  No, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little... Giant 400 pound maggot down the stairs just slithering in.
[01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:11.559]  Puss dripping out of its smell of rotting dead children in its belly.
[01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:14.800]  There's the big giant puss worm.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.241]  Come to save its baby.
[01:00:17.261 --> 01:00:19.101]  The baby's bleeding.
[01:00:20.462 --> 01:00:23.443]  The baby broke its leg when baby fell down in the dark.
[01:00:26.004 --> 01:00:26.344]  And so...
[01:00:28.114 --> 01:00:28.914]  We're getting our bearings.
[01:00:29.455 --> 01:00:30.595]  The light's coming back in our eyes.
[01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:34.177]  We weigh about 85 pounds, but you know what we're fighting for our lives.
[01:00:34.217 --> 01:00:35.237]  Here comes that big worm.
[01:00:38.598 --> 01:00:41.640]  And what are we gonna do to that big, giant, stinking worm?
[01:00:45.461 --> 01:00:51.564]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[01:00:59.477 --> 01:01:07.422]  I've studied their attack profile and what they're doing at every angle to bring down civilization, cutting off the energy, dissolving the borders, creating race war.
[01:01:07.922 --> 01:01:10.804]  Their next moves will be cyber attacks and power outages.
[01:01:10.944 --> 01:01:13.085]  Globalists are going to cut our power off and say that Russia did it.
[01:01:13.245 --> 01:01:16.467]  It might be, oh, hackers took down a part of the power grid.
[01:01:16.647 --> 01:01:19.689]  How many times have I said they're going to blow the power grid up and say Trump supporters did it?
[01:01:19.949 --> 01:01:25.612]  Well, tonight, the nation's intelligence agencies are warning of cyber threats from Russia and are urging U.S.
[01:01:25.672 --> 01:01:28.554]  critical infrastructure defenses to be reinforced.
[01:01:28.974 --> 01:01:34.458]  Homeland Security is warning of a potential troubling escalation in tactics from right-wing extremists.
[01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:38.120]  It wouldn't take much to throw the entire country into darkness.
[01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:42.323]  We've seen the FBI say the number one terror threat is domestic right-wingers.
[01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:46.526]  Specifically those who advocated for the superiority of the white race.
[01:01:46.767 --> 01:01:49.508]  They've now defined it as fascism if you support President Trump.
[01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.170]  What do you mean by Trump-like fascism?
[01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:51.890]  You know what I mean.
[01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.472]  Fascist pro-Trump paramilitary groups.
[01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:57.334]  And then now we start seeing headlines at the top of drugs yesterday.
[01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:58.741]  You know, imminent.
[01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:00.241]  Trump's calling for violence.
[01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:03.002]  Trump's calling for insurrection.
[01:02:03.342 --> 01:02:03.742]  January 6, 2.0.
[01:02:04.062 --> 01:02:11.163]  Threats of violence from homegrown extremists are growing in the wake of the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol, January 6.
[01:02:11.863 --> 01:02:17.244]  And if you look at all the pre-programming data points that are there, they're hyping this up.
[01:02:17.504 --> 01:02:19.705]  The grid is a sprawling target.
[01:02:20.065 --> 01:02:22.105]  There are actually three in the U.S.
[01:02:22.385 --> 01:02:25.346]  The Eastern, Western, and Texas has its own.
[01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:34.191]  Should a transformer explode, the system is designed to trigger a localized grid-preserving blackout.
[01:02:34.332 --> 01:02:41.076]  But if several sections of the grid go down at the same time, the shutdowns can cascade like dominoes.
[01:02:41.296 --> 01:02:46.640]  There's very few number of substations you need to take out in the entire United States to knock out the entire grid.
[01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:56.497]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack.
[01:02:56.797 --> 01:03:03.942]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen as a small disturbance in comparison.
[01:03:04.242 --> 01:03:10.387]  Growing concerns over white supremacy in America as President Biden issues this new warning about the threat that it poses.
[01:03:10.407 --> 01:03:14.370]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[01:03:15.905 --> 01:03:18.808]  This is not going to be the end of MAGA terrorism.
[01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:21.811]  This will only be the beginning.
[01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.614]  When you have U.S.
[01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:34.323]  Senators in both parties saying, we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[01:03:34.623 --> 01:03:36.065]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[01:03:39.013 --> 01:03:40.495]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[01:03:40.515 --> 01:03:43.938]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:48.583]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:56.251]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:57.933]  Think of their ignorance.
[01:03:58.653 --> 01:04:07.917]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[01:04:08.457 --> 01:04:11.058]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[01:04:12.359 --> 01:04:18.021]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[01:04:18.361 --> 01:04:20.182]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:24.728]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:26.229]  It's on record the U.S.
[01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.929]  has those systems.
[01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:32.532]  The point is, it's called mutually assured destruction or MAD for a reason.
[01:04:33.392 --> 01:04:36.653]  Because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:39.815]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:42.316]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[01:04:42.596 --> 01:04:48.618]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia, when that was all a giant lie.
[01:04:48.798 --> 01:04:50.499]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:09.028]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[01:05:09.508 --> 01:05:10.388]  You would rally against it?
[01:05:10.408 --> 01:05:10.929]  You would fight it?
[01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:12.670]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:14.251]  This is the reality of 2023.
[01:05:15.492 --> 01:05:18.474]  I just want to thank listeners and viewers for your last year's support.
[01:05:18.794 --> 01:05:30.183]  I want to encourage you now more than ever to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to take clips and share it from the broadcast, and to buy products that enrich your life at infowareshore.com.

[01:05:37.268 --> 01:05:38.870]  Twice as long as my last book.
[01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.171]  Incredibly powerful.
[01:05:40.231 --> 01:05:41.051]  Signed or unsigned.
[01:05:41.412 --> 01:05:42.513]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:05:47.237 --> 01:05:50.039]  We have TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, back in stock.
[01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:52.441]  And a bunch of other great products as well.

[01:06:02.319 --> 01:06:14.792]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:15.713 --> 01:06:19.357]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:22.363 --> 01:06:28.865]  All right, he's an incredible investigative journalist, and we're going to have him in here at one o'clock, but I'm going to get him in early so we have more time with him.
[01:06:29.466 --> 01:06:35.668]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, the bottom of the hour, Anthony Rubin of muckraker.com.
[01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:42.691]  And man, the footage he's got embedded in Central America and Southern North America, Mexico, is insane.
[01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:46.692]  And that just ties into all the rest of the open border news we've got.
[01:06:47.232 --> 01:06:51.574]  We're going to be covering it in great detail here today.
[01:06:52.765 --> 01:06:54.389]  But we have W.E.F.
[01:06:54.449 --> 01:06:56.494]  meetings in January and new W.E.F.
[01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:59.681]  meetings going on now and COPE for COP 28.
[01:07:01.462 --> 01:07:08.207]  Where they say imminent cyber attacks, MAGA's gonna work with Russia to take out the power during the election.
[01:07:08.267 --> 01:07:09.348]  Why the hell would we do that?
[01:07:09.368 --> 01:07:10.089]  We're way in the lead.
[01:07:10.689 --> 01:07:15.333]  As if Trump supporters, the average conservative person's out doing this.
[01:07:15.813 --> 01:07:20.477]  They're desperate and Biden's threatening nuclear war and troops in Ukraine, which are already happening.
[01:07:20.877 --> 01:07:25.121]  But officially, if we don't give them unlimited money to keep fighting the Russians,
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.721]  Remember, Kennedy kept us from going to war with the Russians.
[01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:30.141]  This is insane.
[01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:37.283]  And the weapons that are around now versus the 1960s are hundreds of times worse.
[01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:45.966]  I mean, it's just, even for me, knowing how crazy the new world order is, the globalists are, it is hard to sit here and look at this news
[01:07:47.003 --> 01:07:49.665]  And realize that we're actually living in this, but they want power.
[01:07:50.085 --> 01:07:50.926]  They've got bunkers.
[01:07:50.986 --> 01:07:51.407]  We don't.
[01:07:52.147 --> 01:07:54.829]  Big enough crisis knocks out the power, knocks out communications.
[01:07:55.149 --> 01:07:59.693]  Well, that'll defeat our political movement to take the country back and establish peace and justice and freedom.
[01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:04.597]  Not some utopia, but we'll certainly not try to be evil on purpose.
[01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:08.620]  So we are at a very important inflection point.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.983]  Let me give you an example here, because I've got a bunch of these clips I want to get to right now.
[01:08:13.931 --> 01:08:19.413]  Obama produced a dystopian movie for Tells Nightmare Future after a cyber attack collapsed the civilization.
[01:08:20.294 --> 01:08:22.795]  The name of the show is Leaving the World Behind.
[01:08:23.735 --> 01:08:39.561]  And I'll play you the trailer, and it's a series, or I guess, they're sort of making it into a series, but they've dropped the first movie where Obama sits there and makes the money off of it while he lives at sea level and tells us, you know, a decade ago that it would be flooded by now.
[01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:41.022]  It's all lies.
[01:08:42.537 --> 01:08:48.558]  But here's a short clip where, well, during the collapse, the one group you can't trust is the white people.
[01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:53.780]  So again, this is the CIA, the establishment, trying to create total division.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.180]  Here it is.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:03.842]  I'm asking for you to remember that if the world falls apart, trust should not be doled out easily to anyone, especially white people.
[01:09:05.023 --> 01:09:06.543]  Even mom would agree with me on that.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.282]  I want to play a clip of Dom Lecrae again.
[01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:15.824]  He was on with us yesterday where he points this out in a moment.
[01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.945]  But play that clip.
[01:09:18.706 --> 01:09:19.226]  Play that.
[01:09:19.266 --> 01:09:20.407]  This is what it's filled with.
[01:09:21.367 --> 01:09:22.568]  Oh, society's collapsing.
[01:09:22.648 --> 01:09:24.109]  Don't trust the white people.
[01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:27.772]  Imagine if they said society's collapsing.
[01:09:28.172 --> 01:09:29.313]  Don't trust the black people.
[01:09:29.593 --> 01:09:31.194]  Or don't trust the Jews.
[01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:32.775]  Or don't trust the Muslims.
[01:09:35.302 --> 01:09:36.783]  This is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:39.325]  This is the establishment doing this to divide us.
[01:09:39.405 --> 01:09:41.226]  It's so illegal.
[01:09:41.266 --> 01:09:42.787]  It's so deceptive.
[01:09:42.827 --> 01:09:44.107]  It's so criminal.
[01:09:44.148 --> 01:09:44.708]  Here it is again.
[01:09:45.588 --> 01:09:53.994]  I'm asking for you to remember that if the world falls apart, trust should not be doled out easily to anyone, especially white people.
[01:09:55.174 --> 01:09:56.715]  Even mom would agree with me on that.
[01:09:57.316 --> 01:09:59.097]  Especially the white people.
[01:10:00.814 --> 01:10:06.637]  That's the mouth of Black Rock and the New World Order, the people running the lithium slave mines in Africa.
[01:10:07.258 --> 01:10:11.520]  I mean, that's so white people watch that and start hating black people.
[01:10:15.082 --> 01:10:15.603]  And it's working.
[01:10:20.105 --> 01:10:26.529]  Before I get into the cyber attack stuff, I played it yesterday, but here's Dom breaking it down.
[01:10:28.547 --> 01:10:33.152]  Everything that Democrats are doing to white Americans, they tested on the black community first.
[01:10:34.073 --> 01:10:36.435]  They destroyed our economy with riots and fire.
[01:10:37.116 --> 01:10:37.817]  They destroyed our-
[01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.771]  Policy.
[01:10:40.151 --> 01:10:43.134]  They destroyed our monuments under the skies of political correctness.
[01:10:43.494 --> 01:10:46.777]  They influenced our use to embrace homosexuality through music.
[01:10:47.378 --> 01:10:49.460]  They influenced our use to rebel through music.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.202]  They refused to give us representation in Hollywood.
[01:10:52.683 --> 01:10:54.124]  They told us we weren't victims.
[01:10:54.544 --> 01:10:56.006]  They forced vaccines on us.
[01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:59.008]  And they called us conspiracy theorists when we said no.
[01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:04.974]  What's even worse, they changed our nationality through the Census Bureau more than four times.
[01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:10.772]  They assassinated our real leaders and left us with controlled opposition, such as Al Sharpton.
[01:11:11.632 --> 01:11:14.853]  They changed the color of our historical figures and ignored our outcry.
[01:11:15.713 --> 01:11:19.194]  They told the entire nation that we were a problem because we were black.
[01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:21.115]  Same thing they're doing with whites today.
[01:11:21.995 --> 01:11:23.276]  Yes, it's a cold hard truth.
[01:11:23.836 --> 01:11:28.778]  The Democrats mastered the ability to control a race and now they are doing the same thing to white Americans.
[01:11:29.878 --> 01:11:31.399]  This is where it truly gets worse.
[01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:35.360]  Every black is aware that this happened to us.
[01:11:36.699 --> 01:11:44.082]  Most of us will embrace the new propaganda and white Americans will view it as ignorant and racist the same way we did to white Americans in the past.
[01:11:44.622 --> 01:11:55.207]  So when Netflix replaced every white actor with a black one, the black community will view it as finally being represented and not notice that every white person was taken out.
[01:11:56.169 --> 01:12:02.413]  White America will notice the replacement and will rightfully speak out, but black Americans will only see the outcry.
[01:12:02.733 --> 01:12:05.254]  They will think that white Americans don't want them to have anything.
[01:12:05.795 --> 01:12:08.536]  We are living in the most powerful psyop of all time.
[01:12:09.677 --> 01:12:13.319]  The only reason that history repeats is because they remove it.
[01:12:14.259 --> 01:12:22.644]  I'm asking for you to remember that if the world falls apart, trust should not be doled out easily to anyone, especially white people.
[01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:25.306]  Even mom would agree with me on that.
[01:12:28.331 --> 01:12:30.759]  I mean, it's so obvious, it's so ridiculous.
[01:12:31.903 --> 01:12:33.749]  Hollywood is the enemy of the people.
[01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:40.352]  I don't care if your neighbors are black or white or whatever color they are, you better be friends with them and have a plan when this stuff starts collapsing.
[01:12:40.752 --> 01:12:41.073]  Oh no!
[01:12:41.813 --> 01:12:44.474]  When the power goes off, don't trust the white people.
[01:12:44.614 --> 01:12:45.815]  What the hell?
[01:12:46.415 --> 01:12:54.999]  And the white people are going to see that, and it's going to mean they're not going to help you, and you're not going to help them, so we can't help each other, see?
[01:12:55.399 --> 01:13:02.842]  When they shut all the power off, which they're saying they're getting ready to do, they don't want us to dress each other and work together.
[01:13:03.282 --> 01:13:04.703]  They want race riots carrying it.
[01:13:07.202 --> 01:13:09.144]  An angrier world that Klaus Schwab talked about.
[01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.045]  This is so transparent.
[01:13:11.466 --> 01:13:12.947]  This isn't even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:13:13.007 --> 01:13:16.910]  This is just, look at the number 1 and say it's 1, or the number 10 and say it's 10.
[01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.972]  I mean, look at the blue sky, it's a blue sky.
[01:13:18.992 --> 01:13:24.957]  I mean, this is, this is so ridiculous.
[01:13:26.498 --> 01:13:28.700]  And the globalists are like, well you're dumb, that's why you deserve to die.
[01:13:28.981 --> 01:13:30.402]  Watch the public's about to follow this.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.442]  I've had the globalists try to recruit me many times in their off-record meetings.
[01:13:35.183 --> 01:13:36.384]  They're like, you know, the public's really done.
[01:13:36.404 --> 01:13:36.924]  You can't say it.
[01:13:36.944 --> 01:13:37.665]  Just go ahead and join us.
[01:13:38.926 --> 01:13:41.448]  But I'm not betting against humanity.
[01:13:45.011 --> 01:13:46.372]  Yeah, extremist attacks on U.S.
[01:13:46.392 --> 01:13:50.835]  power grids are increasing and election season are usually a popular time for them, experts say.
[01:13:51.256 --> 01:13:53.738]  So we're going to win the election as Team Humanity.
[01:13:54.178 --> 01:13:55.779]  They say we're going to blow up the power grid.
[01:13:59.022 --> 01:14:00.303]  Or shut it off with a cyber attack.
[01:14:04.013 --> 01:14:08.115]  Obama-produced film sparks controversy over cautioning against whites.
[01:14:10.536 --> 01:14:15.338]  Imagine if you tuned into a Netflix show and they said, if stuff collapses, don't trust the blacks.
[01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:16.839]  I'd be like, what the hell?
[01:14:17.279 --> 01:14:20.661]  You're going to just lump all black people together like they're bad because of what color they are?
[01:14:21.341 --> 01:14:21.881]  What is this?
[01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:23.022]  It's like Hitler stuff.
[01:14:24.463 --> 01:14:26.884]  Oh, but it's white people, so it's okay.
[01:14:26.904 --> 01:14:28.965]  You know, I saw a clip here.
[01:14:33.012 --> 01:14:42.694]  of Dr. Phil, and I get he's pro-Israel, I'm not anti-Israel, but he does this whole really powerful six minute video, but he says, they're saying kill all the Jews at Harvard.
[01:14:43.935 --> 01:14:50.056]  Imagine, you know, if they said kill the blacks or kill, but he never says kill the whites, because see, that's okay.
[01:14:50.716 --> 01:14:54.477]  And that's blowback from the left, teaching that all whites are bad.
[01:14:54.497 --> 01:14:56.437]  Well, I mean, what did the leftist Jews think was going to happen?
[01:14:57.338 --> 01:14:58.998]  You're getting a big dose of your own medicine there.
[01:15:00.734 --> 01:15:03.797]  So here's the trailer from Leaving the World Behind.
[01:15:04.638 --> 01:15:06.119]  By the way, Elon Musk pointed that out.
[01:15:06.339 --> 01:15:07.600]  He got demonized anti-Semitic.
[01:15:09.362 --> 01:15:11.784]  No, the left is dealing in race-based politics.
[01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:14.266]  I think when Hitler did it, it was dangerous and bad.
[01:15:14.286 --> 01:15:15.747]  I think when they did it, it's dangerous and bad.
[01:15:16.388 --> 01:15:17.169]  And you know it is.
[01:15:17.769 --> 01:15:18.790]  And they're the ones doing it.
[01:15:22.053 --> 01:15:23.955]  Every corporate spokesperson is black.
[01:15:24.991 --> 01:15:26.352]  That's not empowering black people.
[01:15:26.892 --> 01:15:29.134]  That is to totally freak everybody out.
[01:15:29.174 --> 01:15:35.239]  And now the video's been released by Project Veritas of the CEO of IBM.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:37.541]  They literally put Hitler in power.
[01:15:38.141 --> 01:15:38.621]  You look it up.
[01:15:39.722 --> 01:15:43.805]  Saying, we need to get rid of the white people and we gotta follow the ESGs of BlackRock.
[01:15:45.467 --> 01:15:48.489]  Now, that's meant to piss white people off, folks.
[01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:53.480]  This is all a deliberate divide and conquer ahead of them taking us all down.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.641]  There are not going to be reparations paid to anybody.
[01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:58.101]  You're not going to get your student loans paid either, folks.
[01:15:58.862 --> 01:16:01.903]  They are destroying us, all of us.
[01:16:02.203 --> 01:16:02.703]  Here's a clip.
[01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:08.685]  I went online this morning and I rented us a beautiful house out by the beach.
[01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:13.366]  I figured if I made the reservation and packed our bags, it would eliminate most of the reasons to say no.
[01:16:21.687 --> 01:16:22.908]  The kids look so happy.
[01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:28.391]  The Wi-Fi isn't working.
[01:16:30.593 --> 01:16:34.415]  Get a pad.
[01:16:34.515 --> 01:16:39.038]  I'm so sorry to bother you, but this is our house.
[01:16:39.739 --> 01:16:40.499]  This is your house?
[01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:47.964]  We were driving back to the city, then something happened.
[01:16:48.645 --> 01:16:50.426]  You want to stay here, but we're staying here.
[01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.916]  I need to think everything's gonna be okay.
[01:16:59.938 --> 01:17:01.919]  Everything is gonna be okay.
[01:17:04.981 --> 01:17:05.441]  Isn't it?
[01:17:05.641 --> 01:17:08.503]  We are seeing ongoing cyber attacks across the country.
[01:17:11.846 --> 01:17:14.067]  Something is happening and I don't trust them.
[01:17:15.788 --> 01:17:17.649]  Everything I know, I have told you.
[01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.751]  I don't believe you.
[01:17:20.828 --> 01:17:23.008]  I would do anything to protect my family.
[01:17:23.509 --> 01:17:25.549]  What you do is your business.
[01:17:25.649 --> 01:17:31.950]  Get in the car right now!
[01:17:41.212 --> 01:17:44.693]  Haven't you been picking up on what's going on out there?
[01:17:46.253 --> 01:17:47.934]  Whatever it is, it's happening to all of us.
[01:17:47.954 --> 01:17:48.554]  Stop!
[01:17:48.574 --> 01:17:49.134]  Stop!
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:18:05.125]  I just want to know what is the truth.
[01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:14.528]  I'm asking for you to remember that if the world falls apart, trust should not be doled out easily to anyone, especially white people.
[01:18:15.728 --> 01:18:17.209]  Even mom would agree with me on that.
[01:18:20.219 --> 01:18:28.805]  Klaus Schwab said three years ago that when we're done with the COVID lockdowns, we're going to bring in carbon lockdowns for the earth and then a cyber attack is going to deliver it.
[01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:39.252]  And now Obama's new show is out about people fighting over houses.
[01:18:40.486 --> 01:18:45.647]  That they're going to live in because the power's gone off, that there's no gasoline, and we're all killing each other.
[01:18:46.047 --> 01:18:51.508]  Figured it out yet, and the globalists have set up bases near the Arctic Circle, right where the treeline ends.
[01:18:51.688 --> 01:18:52.888]  I've got the people that work there.
[01:18:54.769 --> 01:19:00.590]  And they've set them up in Tasmania, Kauai, Maui, Hawaii.
[01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:03.770]  They've set them up in New Zealand.
[01:19:09.209 --> 01:19:13.510]  They've got a bunch of other bases in Switzerland, and they're going to live in these armored bunkers.
[01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.111]  They don't even trust the security.
[01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:18.932]  So they're building these bases, near-government bases with airfields.
[01:19:18.952 --> 01:19:22.313]  They have their own separate houses near them, usually a few miles away.
[01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:24.994]  They've got robot helicopters.
[01:19:26.074 --> 01:19:32.756]  The people that saw this at Zuckerberg's house, and I was told this years before by people that were in New Zealand looking at facilities being built.
[01:19:34.246 --> 01:19:59.100]  For some of the top, quote, Hollywood people and also James Cameron, where they've got robot helicopters ready, so there's no human needed, to get them to airfields when they want, and they've got pop-up bases with heavy machine guns that a robot run, where they can sit in their bunker with robot machine guns, because they know they can't trust the contractors.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.201]  So when they pull this, they're gonna tell the contractors, oh you guys, you'll know what's going down, contractors, call me.
[01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:10.803]  And they already figured this out when they tell you, okay, we don't need you anymore, take off a month, go back and see your family in the States.
[01:20:13.163 --> 01:20:17.965]  And these facilities are hundreds of miles away from even small towns, most of them.
[01:20:18.685 --> 01:20:20.966]  Not the ones in Hawaii, but they've got staging areas there.
[01:20:21.826 --> 01:20:26.167]  And they got underground bases, everything, military bases, and
[01:20:27.537 --> 01:20:39.722]  They're going to go underground, turn the power off, cyber attack everything, and then they got a movie where when it goes down, the white people and black people all kill each other.
[01:20:40.582 --> 01:20:42.283]  You can't make this stuff up, man.
[01:20:43.243 --> 01:20:51.947]  They've had unlimited money underground, I don't mean literally underground, but through the black ops, to fund all this stuff and to build their literal underground systems.
[01:20:54.738 --> 01:20:57.221]  Klaus Schwab and his cyber attack in his angrier world.
[01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:59.123]  Here's a clip of this James Bond villain.
[01:21:17.312 --> 01:21:33.860]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:21:34.781 --> 01:21:43.465]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:49.458]  And what do you do when the power goes off or the internet stops working?
[01:21:51.199 --> 01:21:53.701]  Well, according to them, if you're white, you kill black people.
[01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:54.941]  If you're black, you kill white people.
[01:21:55.242 --> 01:21:56.282]  That'll fix things.
[01:21:59.605 --> 01:22:01.266]  And they had this incubating and ready.
[01:22:01.406 --> 01:22:03.207]  Now they're rolling it out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:04.508 --> 01:22:05.849]  No, my enemy is not black people.
[01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:09.111]  My enemy is not Hispanic people or white people or anybody else.
[01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:13.054]  My enemy is Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and King Charles and the New World Order.
[01:22:14.991 --> 01:22:22.416]  They're getting ready for nuclear war with Russia, they're gonna need an excuse to shut everything off ahead of time, and they're strongly considering doing it.
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:32.604]  And once you can't communicate, it won't matter if you know this information, they think.
[01:22:36.027 --> 01:22:42.211]  Because everybody's pre-programmed with all the race division to start killing each other when the resources get cut off.
[01:22:43.732 --> 01:22:44.493]  Figured it out yet?
[01:22:45.839 --> 01:22:49.602]  And we're days, weeks, months away from this.
[01:22:49.642 --> 01:22:58.789]  They are really, right before they released COVID, they were like, Trump will be challenged by a virus, disease X, we're getting ready for it, it'll bring in the world government.
[01:22:59.269 --> 01:23:02.691]  They were telling you, that's how I went on air and said, this is imminent.
[01:23:02.912 --> 01:23:05.594]  You know those videos have hundreds of millions of views of me saying that.
[01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:11.138]  Because people go, Jones is one of them, or he's got a crystal ball.
[01:23:11.498 --> 01:23:14.120]  No, you see them preparing it now.
[01:23:17.557 --> 01:23:19.598]  You see it going down now.
[01:23:25.902 --> 01:23:31.705]  No, my problem is not my black neighbors or my white neighbors.
[01:23:31.745 --> 01:23:33.006]  My problem is the new world order.
[01:23:33.966 --> 01:23:35.167]  And I hope you record this.
[01:23:35.187 --> 01:23:37.528]  I hope you save it because you won't get it once everything goes offline.
[01:23:37.748 --> 01:23:38.849]  Hope you got some solar panels.
[01:23:38.869 --> 01:23:43.872]  I want the globalists to know.
[01:23:46.328 --> 01:23:57.881]  With their bases in Northern Canada, their bases in Tasmania, their bases in Kauai, their bases in Switzerland, their bases in Wyoming and Montana, their bases all over the place.
[01:23:59.863 --> 01:24:01.045]  They're big mega yachts.
[01:24:04.827 --> 01:24:07.029]  You know, Larry Page won't even come to the U.S.
[01:24:07.069 --> 01:24:07.350]  anymore.
[01:24:08.091 --> 01:24:11.675]  He stays on mega yachts in private islands in the South Pacific.
[01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:16.740]  I mean, I've been in big meetings of Bilderberg group members asking me, where do you think we ought to go?
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.821]  We got bases here and there.
[01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:18.362]  What do you think?
[01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.546]  You know, I didn't just say that, right?
[01:24:22.607 --> 01:24:23.808]  Like, I don't just say this stuff.
[01:24:27.779 --> 01:24:32.464]  I was in a two and a half hour conversation with Elon Musk Sunday, and it's now got like 20 million views, just the main video.
[01:24:32.664 --> 01:24:34.126]  Not to mention the hundreds of millions of views of the clips.
[01:24:34.146 --> 01:24:36.348]  And he's like, yeah, no, they want to kill everybody and show everything off.
[01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:36.969]  How do we stop them?
[01:24:37.349 --> 01:24:40.372]  I mean, whether you think he's good or bad, he's saying that and saying we should stop it.
[01:24:42.214 --> 01:24:46.078]  This is beyond insanity, beyond madness.
[01:24:46.118 --> 01:24:48.741]  And I believe cooler heads can prevail.
[01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:57.315]  And this is so compartmentalized, 99.9999% of people, even in the government, don't even know about this.
[01:24:57.895 --> 01:25:07.165]  And if the globalists think having a robot helicopter, and you know for 20 years all the planes are already, even the small ones, are already robot run.
[01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.066]  You don't need pilots.
[01:25:08.586 --> 01:25:11.009]  They just put the course in, take the plane off.
[01:25:14.622 --> 01:25:15.462]  But stuff's still going to break.
[01:25:15.482 --> 01:25:16.283]  There's still going to be problems.
[01:25:16.763 --> 01:25:18.944]  And these globalists have built these underground bases.
[01:25:19.444 --> 01:25:21.165]  They've built tombs for themselves.
[01:25:23.526 --> 01:25:32.930]  And if I know all about Mark Zuckerberg's combat robots, which I don't just know about it.
[01:25:33.111 --> 01:25:33.751]  I've been shown it.
[01:25:36.072 --> 01:25:40.354]  And don't you know the locals that built all that there in Kauai?
[01:25:43.612 --> 01:25:46.513]  You know what they're planning to do once the lights go off, Zuckerberg?
[01:25:47.054 --> 01:25:49.475]  Oh, your robot might take out the first hundred people to come.
[01:25:50.696 --> 01:25:53.317]  You just built yourself a mausoleum.
[01:25:53.417 --> 01:25:54.297]  And I'm not threatening you.
[01:25:54.337 --> 01:25:55.758]  I'm just saying, stop it!
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:01.381]  You're like Hitler in Berlin in 1945.
[01:26:01.981 --> 01:26:02.782]  Knock it off.
[01:26:03.182 --> 01:26:04.422]  Your plan is public.
[01:26:05.023 --> 01:26:05.943]  Don't do it.
[01:26:07.164 --> 01:26:07.604]  Stop!
[01:26:13.291 --> 01:26:14.851]  And I wouldn't even call my feelings fear.
[01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:16.412]  I am more disgusted.
[01:26:17.832 --> 01:26:20.053]  I am more disgusted because I've not spent time getting ready.
[01:26:20.393 --> 01:26:21.734]  I've been spending time trying to stop this.
[01:26:21.794 --> 01:26:24.775]  That's the best... The best defense is an offense.
[01:26:25.915 --> 01:26:27.255]  But man, I guarantee you this.
[01:26:29.276 --> 01:26:35.638]  Mark this down, put it on your refrigerator door, like... George Straits says.
[01:26:38.139 --> 01:26:38.699]  Write this down.
[01:26:40.319 --> 01:26:46.407]  We're gonna, not me, I'll be, the stuff all starts, they're gonna take me on pretty quick.
[01:26:46.427 --> 01:26:47.649]  That's okay, I already did my job.
[01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.191]  I already raised the alarm.
[01:26:49.612 --> 01:26:50.793]  But we're, you're gonna get it.
[01:26:55.059 --> 01:26:56.521]  And everybody's gonna know you did it.
[01:26:59.079 --> 01:27:02.380]  Everybody's going to know you megalomaniac death cult lunatics did this.
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:05.181]  I know a lot of you just think it's so exciting and fun you can't help it.
[01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:08.683]  But a lot of you are compartmentalized to the next level.
[01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:11.724]  I mean, you're right at the top level but not, you know, fully.
[01:27:12.364 --> 01:27:13.505]  And you know this is going on.
[01:27:13.565 --> 01:27:14.265]  It's leaked to you.
[01:27:14.305 --> 01:27:14.925]  You know it's happening.
[01:27:15.225 --> 01:27:19.007]  I mean, are you really going to try to take Hitler to the thousandth level?
[01:27:19.027 --> 01:27:21.568]  I mean, are you really going to pull this crap off?
[01:27:22.848 --> 01:27:23.588]  We're going to go on a break.
[01:27:24.549 --> 01:27:25.689]  We can back this off easily.
[01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:26.329]  I think we will.
[01:27:26.389 --> 01:27:27.270]  I see a lot of good signs.
[01:27:28.351 --> 01:27:31.433]  I don't have any globalists funding me, any big money funding me.
[01:27:31.453 --> 01:27:33.654]  I'm funded by you, plus Christmas is here.
[01:27:34.074 --> 01:27:36.396]  You need supplements that empower your immune system right now.

[01:28:31.617 --> 01:28:34.539]  They want to tell you it's all grave, that it's your fault, so you just give up.
[01:28:34.579 --> 01:28:37.341]  No, no, we're telling you how grave it is, but no, we can beat this and stop it.
[01:28:38.041 --> 01:28:39.282]  But I need your support.

[01:28:53.938 --> 01:28:54.358]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:07.445]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over, whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population, and they were already beginning to do it?
[01:29:07.925 --> 01:29:08.806]  You would rally against it?
[01:29:08.826 --> 01:29:09.366]  You would fight it?
[01:29:09.726 --> 01:29:11.107]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:29:11.567 --> 01:29:12.687]  This is the reality of 2023.

[01:31:58.157 --> 01:31:59.198]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[01:31:59.218 --> 01:31:59.938]  Do you like RainForce?
[01:32:00.518 --> 01:32:02.580]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladly.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.001]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:32:05.101 --> 01:32:11.005]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[01:32:11.405 --> 01:32:14.447]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[01:32:14.787 --> 01:32:18.750]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:22.673]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:32:22.733 --> 01:32:28.137]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:32:28.297 --> 01:32:35.963]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:32:36.003 --> 01:32:41.648]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[01:32:42.108 --> 01:32:42.789]  Alright, we love you.
[01:32:42.829 --> 01:32:43.409]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:43.449 --> 01:32:48.233]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[01:32:48.293 --> 01:32:49.634]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[01:33:00.501 --> 01:33:06.386]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.291 --> 01:33:16.073]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:33:16.293 --> 01:33:17.254]  We think, just let me think.
[01:33:17.274 --> 01:33:22.817]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:33:22.837 --> 01:33:23.618]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:24.758]  Damn it!
[01:33:24.878 --> 01:33:25.199]  Why?
[01:33:25.959 --> 01:33:32.003]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:33:32.543 --> 01:33:36.626]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciator.
[01:33:37.546 --> 01:33:43.290]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:44.330]  You designed it, sir.
[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:45.271]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:33:45.291 --> 01:33:46.692]  You told me every television in London!
[01:33:46.952 --> 01:33:48.873]  Cruelty and injustice.
[01:33:49.053 --> 01:33:50.414]  Intolerance and oppression.
[01:33:50.854 --> 01:34:00.660]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and surveilling your submissiveness.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:00.820]  Cameras.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.400]  We need cameras.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.441]  How did this happen?
[01:34:03.161 --> 01:34:03.902]  Who's to blame?
[01:34:04.902 --> 01:34:07.524]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:34:07.544 --> 01:34:09.446]  They will be held accountable.
[01:34:09.466 --> 01:34:15.351]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:34:16.548 --> 01:34:18.089]  I know why you did it.
[01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:19.611]  I know you were afraid.
[01:34:20.031 --> 01:34:20.772]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:34:21.272 --> 01:34:21.712]  War?
[01:34:22.013 --> 01:34:22.473]  Terror?
[01:34:22.653 --> 01:34:23.314]  Disease?
[01:34:23.954 --> 01:34:29.859]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:34:30.399 --> 01:34:36.184]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:34:36.785 --> 01:34:42.970]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:34:49.665 --> 01:34:50.945]  There is a war.
[01:34:51.345 --> 01:34:52.366]  It's happening now.
[01:34:53.226 --> 01:34:55.026]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:57.407]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:34:58.167 --> 01:34:59.648]  We are the Resistance.
[01:35:00.088 --> 01:35:01.928]  We are the Infowar.
[01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.351]  I'm watching the midterms.
[01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:28.312]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:35:28.753 --> 01:35:32.434]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[01:35:36.396 --> 01:35:38.317]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:35:38.397 --> 01:35:40.058]  You bought a truck?
[01:35:40.198 --> 01:35:45.320]  You bought a truck?
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.102]  Yeah!
[01:35:49.162 --> 01:35:49.262]  What?
[01:35:50.929 --> 01:35:58.974]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[01:36:27.128 --> 01:36:28.329]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:36:28.389 --> 01:36:40.877]  All right, the country's being gutted, our dollar's being destroyed, our borders are being dissolved, and I've been wanting to get Anthony Ribbon on for a long time.
[01:36:41.397 --> 01:36:48.761]  I've seen him as a guest on some of the other shows, but I tell you, people like Michael Yon, who's an incredible investigative journalist, really admire his work, so do I.
[01:36:49.682 --> 01:36:50.323]  He's a journalist.
[01:36:50.823 --> 01:36:54.486]  Reports on illegal immigration, human smuggling, and issues affecting the border.
[01:36:55.127 --> 01:36:58.370]  Muckraker.com on X. Real Muckraker on YouTube.
[01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:59.070]  Real Muckraker.
[01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:01.292]  And congratulations, Anthony.
[01:37:01.713 --> 01:37:02.633]  You've been kidnapped.
[01:37:02.814 --> 01:37:04.315]  I mean, we watch every day.
[01:37:04.335 --> 01:37:05.396]  You on the trains.
[01:37:05.476 --> 01:37:06.817]  The beast coming in, as they call it.
[01:37:06.837 --> 01:37:09.239]  We've got a bunch of clips here to go over with you.
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:13.843]  We have Mauritius suddenly saying, oh, the border is broken, and terrorists are about to head us to the FBI.
[01:37:14.744 --> 01:37:15.525]  Thank you so much.
[01:37:38.188 --> 01:37:40.310]  You've got a lot of clips to get to, a lot to cover.
[01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:46.675]  We're going to have you here for at least about an hour and 15-20 minutes and I'll have some final news before I hand the baton to the next show in the War Room.
[01:37:47.396 --> 01:37:48.156]  But, wow!
[01:37:48.797 --> 01:38:02.388]  Tell people, a lot of folks know who you are, but your experiences, what you got into this, what you're witnessing, I follow your reporting, I'm not putting words in your mouth, the exponential increase in the illegal alien flow, the UN organizing it, the Chi-Coms, I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:38:02.628 --> 01:38:04.789]  Sure, I mean, I'm just gonna give, you know, we have limited time.
[01:38:04.829 --> 01:38:10.430]  I'm gonna give everybody just a high-level, bird's-eye view, and then we could dive in and talk about the whole illegal alien trail.
[01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:13.331]  And what I will say is, you know, we got about an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:38:13.431 --> 01:38:23.954]  I believe if we're able to do this properly that the audience, anybody watching this, you're probably gonna walk away knowing more about this illegal alien mass migration pipeline, that I call it, than any sitting congressman or senator.
[01:38:23.974 --> 01:38:25.034]  I mean, these people know nothing.
[01:38:25.194 --> 01:38:26.514]  These are just sock puppets.
[01:38:26.534 --> 01:38:27.754]  They don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:28.775]  I've seen the whole thing.
[01:38:28.795 --> 01:38:29.415]  We're gonna go over it.
[01:38:29.995 --> 01:38:35.196]  But what you're witnessing is an invasion of our sovereign republic, of our United States of America.
[01:38:35.656 --> 01:38:41.818]  You look at the definition of an invasion, it's an incursion of a large group of people into a sphere of activity.
[01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:43.118]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[01:38:43.158 --> 01:38:44.679]  It fits the definition of an invasion.
[01:38:44.699 --> 01:38:46.519]  And you're going to break down what's happening, who's behind it.
[01:38:46.559 --> 01:38:51.600]  I would describe it as the mouth is chewing all these people up, you and Ron, and they crap it out on us.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.621]  You've been up and down like a probe inside the intestines.
[01:38:55.041 --> 01:38:55.821]  Correct, correct.
[01:38:55.861 --> 01:39:03.903]  And what I do want to say, just so we can kind of just like set the stage before we go into this, I mean, we are literally living in pre-genocide days, which you just covered beforehand.
[01:39:03.923 --> 01:39:17.146]  I'm glad that you did that, where you see all this demonization of white people, all this race hatred, and then now what's happening is you are importing a desperate third world underclass that are going to be controlled and can be weaponized and will be weaponized against us.
[01:39:17.426 --> 01:39:17.566]  That's
[01:39:32.726 --> 01:39:35.248]  I mean, I'm Anthony Rubin, founder of Muckraker.com.
[01:39:35.308 --> 01:39:37.710]  I started it because I am a pissed-off American.
[01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:38.631]  I don't like tyranny.
[01:39:38.691 --> 01:39:40.553]  I don't like bullies, and tyrants are bullies.
[01:39:40.993 --> 01:39:41.994]  And that's all I could say.
[01:39:42.014 --> 01:39:42.815]  That's why I started this.
[01:39:42.835 --> 01:39:48.119]  You know, it was during COVID-19 when we were being locked down and controlled by these maniacs.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.321]  I was thinking, you know, what can I do?
[01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:53.224]  Because I'm not just going to sit here helplessly and just let these people control my life.
[01:39:53.604 --> 01:39:59.506]  I didn't have millions of dollars to run for office, otherwise maybe I would have tried to do something like that, but I probably wouldn't have done that either way because I don't have the credentials, right?
[01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:05.407]  I'm not going to be like an AOC running with no background at all, just being a bartender and not thinking that I could actually legislate effectively.
[01:40:05.687 --> 01:40:10.249]  So I thought, okay, you know, I'm a man, I got a pair of cojones and I got a camera, so let me just go out and start filming things.
[01:40:10.269 --> 01:40:10.809]  And so it started...
[01:40:11.249 --> 01:40:16.212]  Confronting Antifa and going to George Floyd Square and going down to Skid Row and Crack Tents and what not.
[01:40:16.232 --> 01:40:19.154]  Then I actually saw you guys covering the border first down in McAllen.
[01:40:19.574 --> 01:40:24.557]  I made my first border trip just by myself and then I went down to Eagles Pass where there was a caravan of like 20 people.
[01:40:24.577 --> 01:40:26.959]  Mother, that was our plan was to trigger other people to go do it.
[01:40:27.099 --> 01:40:27.639]  It worked.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:28.120]  It worked.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:36.146]  I followed you guys and I went down there and then, you know, I swam across the river a little bit while later with that caravan of like 20,000 Haitians that came across the Nile Pass.
[01:40:36.707 --> 01:40:39.249]  And it just, it just continued to snowball off of that.
[01:40:39.269 --> 01:40:41.631]  You know, I met Michael Yan, went down to the Daring Gap with him.
[01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:48.596]  And, you know, before you know it, I'm, you know, one of the country's border guys going down and following the whole mass migration trail.
[01:40:48.616 --> 01:40:55.602]  And the reason why I decided to follow this trail here and what we're going to talk about, and I don't want this to be about my whole experience as much as the intel that's so critical.
[01:40:55.622 --> 01:40:56.663]  Yeah, but we want to know about you.
[01:40:56.823 --> 01:40:58.744]  We're all about personal, about people.
[01:40:59.365 --> 01:41:00.826]  I just want to hear your personal view, too.
[01:41:00.966 --> 01:41:01.646]  I got you, I got you.
[01:41:01.727 --> 01:41:09.072]  I mean, well, you know, I've kind of given my personal view that we're being invaded, but what I will say is I'm just an American that decided to take action, okay?
[01:41:09.112 --> 01:41:15.016]  And if that can inspire anybody at home that's sitting on the sidelines not knowing what to do or, you know, you're looking for some motivation, I mean, let this be it.
[01:41:15.056 --> 01:41:15.857]  This is your message.
[01:41:16.357 --> 01:41:19.840]  Stand up and take action because you don't know how far it will take and you will affect change.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.121]  So that's my summary.
[01:41:22.221 --> 01:41:25.123]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:41:25.163 --> 01:41:25.804]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:41:26.224 --> 01:41:26.705]  Absolutely.
[01:41:27.125 --> 01:41:27.565]  Absolutely.
[01:41:28.766 --> 01:41:33.251]  So, I mean, you know, I think we should... We keep acting like globalists have magical powers.
[01:41:33.611 --> 01:41:35.333]  Their magical power is we're sitting on our ass.
[01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:36.393]  That's exactly right.
[01:41:36.614 --> 01:41:37.194]  That's exactly right.
[01:41:37.214 --> 01:41:39.977]  If enough of us stand up and we reach critical mass, these people don't stand a chance.
[01:41:40.497 --> 01:41:49.045]  All right, so you start going into the border, you start going down, and I've talked to Jan, he said you and your few guys are what they're doing more than like half the other people.
[01:41:49.506 --> 01:41:50.426]  What are you witnessing?
[01:41:50.466 --> 01:41:50.927]  What are you seeing?
[01:41:51.107 --> 01:41:53.928]  Yeah, and just so everybody's aware, it's not even me and a bunch of others.
[01:41:53.988 --> 01:41:56.449]  It's myself and my younger brother, Joshua Rubin.
[01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:57.470]  Couldn't do it without him.
[01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:58.310]  My best friend in the world.
[01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:00.491]  So if it wasn't for him, I probably would have been killed along this journey.
[01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:01.631]  So, thank God for him.
[01:42:02.152 --> 01:42:02.932]  What am I witnessing?
[01:42:03.032 --> 01:42:09.835]  I'm witnessing a mass invasion of mostly military-age men that are coming up to our border, totally aided by the United Nations.
[01:42:09.875 --> 01:42:13.336]  I've come here today with receipts so that nobody can dispute anything that I'm saying.
[01:42:13.356 --> 01:42:14.897]  The overhead shot while he talks about it.
[01:42:15.077 --> 01:42:16.037]  Overhead shot all this.
[01:42:16.458 --> 01:42:20.859]  I'd like to get into each and every one of these documents, but I mean, for example, I've come with numerous maps.
[01:42:20.919 --> 01:42:21.779]  I didn't just come with one.
[01:42:21.819 --> 01:42:25.821]  The only one that I've seen published by other outlets, for example, is this Red Cross map.
[01:42:25.861 --> 01:42:28.482]  And everybody's been all over this, oh my god, it's a Red Cross map.
[01:42:28.522 --> 01:42:31.283]  Which, this is probably the most intense one that's out there.
[01:42:31.643 --> 01:42:39.226]  But I brought a bunch of other ones because I want people to understand it's not just some one-off document, some one-off thing from the Red Cross that they're printing this.
[01:42:39.266 --> 01:42:40.266]  I mean, I have another one here.
[01:42:40.726 --> 01:42:43.927]  This is from, uh, Medicocin Fronteras.
[01:42:44.167 --> 01:42:45.107]  Doctors Without Borders.
[01:42:45.167 --> 01:42:45.827]  It's double-sided.
[01:42:45.847 --> 01:42:54.509]  Uh, this one here, this side, it shows basically how to go from Panama all the way to Mexico, and then the other side is an in-depth map of Mexico.
[01:42:54.549 --> 01:42:58.030]  And these are my quote-unquote migration routes all the way to the United States border.
[01:42:58.050 --> 01:42:59.890]  So what I'm seeing is a... It's a battle plan.
[01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:00.610]  It's a battle plan.
[01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:01.390]  That's what this is.
[01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:02.651]  I mean, these are historic relics.
[01:43:02.671 --> 01:43:03.571]  I mean, you should take one of these.
[01:43:03.811 --> 01:43:08.212]  I got one for you hanging up in the office because this is literally captured enemy battle plan documents right here.
[01:43:09.361 --> 01:43:11.983]  It's all fun about USAID, UN, you name it.
[01:43:12.243 --> 01:43:12.543]  Correct.
[01:43:12.823 --> 01:43:14.044]  Absolutely.
[01:43:14.664 --> 01:43:15.685]  Get into it.
[01:43:15.705 --> 01:43:17.426]  The footage you've got is unbelievable.
[01:43:17.626 --> 01:43:17.926]  Absolutely.
[01:43:17.946 --> 01:43:25.451]  So I'm going to take everybody basically from the mouth of this thing all the way to its end at our United States border.
[01:43:25.511 --> 01:43:27.492]  So here's what's going down basically.
[01:43:28.112 --> 01:43:29.133]  This past summer,
[01:43:29.773 --> 01:43:34.037]  I had met a illegal alien down in the Daring Gap during my first trip down there.
[01:43:34.457 --> 01:43:35.618]  I stayed in contact with him.
[01:43:35.638 --> 01:43:36.959]  He ended up making it to the U.S.
[01:43:37.179 --> 01:43:38.000]  shortly thereafter.
[01:43:38.761 --> 01:43:44.386]  And one day, he just sends me a 200-page PDF document, and it's all written in Mandarin.
[01:43:44.586 --> 01:43:46.748]  And so I have, like, the first 20 pages of it translated.
[01:43:47.128 --> 01:43:52.212]  And it's literally a step-by-step instruction manual on how to go from Quito to Ecuador, all the way to the United States border.
[01:43:52.252 --> 01:43:53.854]  He goes, yeah, like, my family used this.
[01:43:53.874 --> 01:43:55.115]  It's passed around to WeChat groups.
[01:43:55.695 --> 01:43:59.839]  And so then I have the rest translated, and it's basically like how to work the asylum system once you're in America.
[01:44:00.259 --> 01:44:00.479]  Okay?
[01:44:00.539 --> 01:44:01.140]  And I published this.
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:02.701]  Like, almost nobody picked it up, but that's okay.
[01:44:03.062 --> 01:44:04.003]  But then I figured, you know what?
[01:44:04.203 --> 01:44:10.008]  Nobody's ever actually gone from Quito, Ecuador all the way to the United States border and documented it.
[01:44:10.068 --> 01:44:11.389]  And so I figured that's what we would do.
[01:44:11.429 --> 01:44:11.609]  And so...
[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:13.180]  Let's just start.
[01:44:13.961 --> 01:44:20.203]  So, first thing we do, we get on a plane, and we fly to Quito, and immediately you start seeing clues.
[01:44:20.363 --> 01:44:27.946]  For example, there was an Airbnb-type hotel that was like right around the corner from us that we stumbled upon, just packed with military-aged Chinese men.
[01:44:27.966 --> 01:44:31.327]  I couldn't actually get onto the premises because it was fenced off, and I'm filming them, and there's... So you're in Ecuador?
[01:44:31.767 --> 01:44:33.188]  In Ecuador right now, that's right, in Quito.
[01:44:33.829 --> 01:44:39.793]  And so, you know, first thing you see, first thing I found there was just this hotel that was packed with military-age Chinese.
[01:44:39.833 --> 01:44:46.538]  I then go to the bus station because we were only there for a day, there wasn't too much to see, because that's really just a landing point, and then I start trekking to Colombia immediately.
[01:44:46.878 --> 01:44:47.979]  There, I mean, these people are on a mission.
[01:44:48.659 --> 01:44:54.145]  Um, so I get to the bus station that's there in Quito, and again, I'm starting to see more Chinese.
[01:44:54.165 --> 01:44:55.406]  That's predominantly the group I'm seeing.
[01:44:55.946 --> 01:44:57.408]  Then, here's where it starts to get interesting.
[01:44:57.428 --> 01:45:01.031]  So then we take a bus to the border town of Tolkien, okay?
[01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:04.154]  And that's right across from Columbia.
[01:45:04.174 --> 01:45:07.217]  I mean, you can literally walk to- By the way, I had Joe Rogan send me this clip like two weeks ago.
[01:45:07.257 --> 01:45:08.118]  He goes, is this real?
[01:45:08.138 --> 01:45:09.960]  And I said, you bet your ass it is.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:10.781]  Oh, that's incredible.
[01:45:11.061 --> 01:45:11.281]  Yeah.
[01:45:11.481 --> 01:45:11.882]  Keep going.
[01:45:11.982 --> 01:45:12.863]  That's absolutely real.
[01:45:12.903 --> 01:45:13.303]  That's right.
[01:45:13.483 --> 01:45:14.324]  We'll get into that.
[01:45:14.664 --> 01:45:17.707]  So then we get to this border town in Ecuador called Tolkien.
[01:45:17.727 --> 01:45:19.128]  And this is where things start to get interesting.
[01:45:19.168 --> 01:45:22.251]  I mean, you get there and the entire town is set up.
[01:45:23.672 --> 01:45:24.653]  They hand out these maps.
[01:45:24.773 --> 01:45:26.315]  And this is a map of Tolkien.
[01:45:26.975 --> 01:45:31.279]  And you can see here, it literally just lists every single NGO that you could think of.
[01:45:31.399 --> 01:45:32.140]  Overhead shot, guys.
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:33.461]  Yeah, Overhead shot this.
[01:45:33.821 --> 01:45:41.125]  Every single NGO that you guys can think of that is responsible for taking part in this mass migration pipeline is here in Tolkien.
[01:45:41.165 --> 01:45:45.288]  And they literally hand out these basically treasure maps to these quote-unquote migrants.
[01:45:45.668 --> 01:45:48.650]  Well, I actually want to address the word migrant because we shouldn't be using that term.
[01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:49.510]  Illegal alien invader.
[01:45:49.650 --> 01:45:50.811]  Illegal alien invader.
[01:45:50.991 --> 01:45:52.512]  That's the correct legal term.
[01:45:53.272 --> 01:46:02.655]  And they hand them out and I mean you guys can see this that's what this is and they could literally just go boom boom boom boom boom and go to all of these different stops and get all the different aid and instructions that they need.
[01:46:02.675 --> 01:46:07.537]  It's like a staging point and then continue on into Columbia and and onwards.
[01:46:07.617 --> 01:46:08.957]  But I mean you can see how incredible it is.
[01:46:08.977 --> 01:46:09.837]  Tell us about some of the NGOs.
[01:46:09.857 --> 01:46:10.637]  Zoom in even more guys.
[01:46:10.678 --> 01:46:11.298]  Turn it sideways.
[01:46:11.438 --> 01:46:11.718]  Zoom in.
[01:46:12.418 --> 01:46:12.658]  Yeah.
[01:46:12.698 --> 01:46:14.039]  You can see it on screen as you do it.
[01:46:14.059 --> 01:46:15.981]  That's why I wanted to get scans of these.
[01:46:16.181 --> 01:46:17.382]  Tell us about some of the groups.
[01:46:17.502 --> 01:46:17.702]  Sure.
[01:46:17.802 --> 01:46:19.944]  So let me just kind of explain a few of these.
[01:46:19.984 --> 01:46:21.205]  I mean, there's so many of them.
[01:46:21.365 --> 01:46:22.405]  Everybody knows the Red Cross.
[01:46:22.425 --> 01:46:24.327]  That's where you get these types of maps.
[01:46:24.407 --> 01:46:26.148]  Cruz Roja en Español.
[01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:28.890]  Then there's the Norwegian Refugee Council.
[01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:33.594]  You go there and they give a lot of legal instructions.
[01:46:33.894 --> 01:46:35.915]  There's other ones.
[01:46:36.035 --> 01:46:37.376]  There's, for example, the OIM.
[01:46:38.317 --> 01:46:38.777]  How's this?
[01:46:38.797 --> 01:46:40.118]  I actually picked this up in Tolkien.
[01:46:40.398 --> 01:46:41.038]  This is incredible.
[01:46:41.438 --> 01:46:45.620]  It's comical more than anything, but it's important to show what these people are spending our money on.
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.381]  I picked this up there at the IOM, also known as the OIM.
[01:46:49.401 --> 01:46:51.542]  That's the International Organization of Migration.
[01:46:53.823 --> 01:46:56.384]  That's basically the migration arm of the United Nations.
[01:46:56.404 --> 01:47:01.226]  This is a direct United Nations sub-agency and this comes in a larger kit, this pamphlet that I'm holding right here.
[01:47:01.506 --> 01:47:05.227]  This is a pamphlet that explains in detail how to put on a condom, okay?
[01:47:05.707 --> 01:47:08.308]  And it comes in a larger kit that I think that you've talked about on your show.
[01:47:08.328 --> 01:47:08.949]  It's like a rape kit.
[01:47:08.969 --> 01:47:11.630]  It comes with condoms and morning-after pills and female condoms.
[01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:13.190]  And they just hand this stuff out.
[01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:16.311]  They want to give me the kit for whatever reason, but I was able to get this pamphlet.
[01:47:16.351 --> 01:47:20.573]  And the point is, you know, people are getting raped and brutalized
[01:47:21.454 --> 01:47:28.600]  Amnesty International, like a decade, said that 80 plus percent of women coming across into Mexico are getting raped.
[01:47:28.961 --> 01:47:29.381]  I believe it.
[01:47:29.621 --> 01:47:30.022]  I believe it.
[01:47:30.082 --> 01:47:31.403]  If that's the number they give, I believe it.
[01:47:31.623 --> 01:47:33.786]  And I mean, you can see it right here.
[01:47:33.846 --> 01:47:38.150]  I mean, they're handing out as if anybody, as if any potential rapist is going to read this pamphlet.
[01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:41.233]  But I mean you can see it's so out in the open and it's finance.
[01:47:41.273 --> 01:47:44.477]  You can see the American flag there and it says there in fine print.
[01:47:44.537 --> 01:47:45.798]  I don't know if the cameras can pick that up.
[01:47:45.878 --> 01:47:51.844]  Con el apoyo financiero de and then American flag with the financial support of the United States of America.
[01:47:52.205 --> 01:47:53.166]  So this is... Turn that around.
[01:47:53.206 --> 01:47:54.567]  Show those slowly viewers.
[01:47:54.708 --> 01:47:55.228]  Yeah right here.
[01:47:55.248 --> 01:47:55.809]  Look at that.
[01:47:56.129 --> 01:47:57.249]  Check that out.
[01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:59.630]  From the OIM.
[01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:01.471]  Also known as the IOM in English.
[01:48:01.811 --> 01:48:02.191]  And that's that.
[01:48:02.231 --> 01:48:02.691]  I mean, look at that.
[01:48:02.971 --> 01:48:04.032]  How to put on a condom.
[01:48:04.052 --> 01:48:05.852]  It's just so blatant in your face.
[01:48:05.872 --> 01:48:09.353]  I mean, if this doesn't piss you off that your tax dollars are going to this while we've got people in the streets... The U.S.
[01:48:09.373 --> 01:48:12.554]  government's telling him, Biden said, when I win, immediately surge the border.
[01:48:12.854 --> 01:48:13.715]  It's all finance.
[01:48:13.775 --> 01:48:14.235]  It's all there.
[01:48:14.835 --> 01:48:15.195]  Correct.
[01:48:15.595 --> 01:48:16.055]  Absolutely.
[01:48:16.315 --> 01:48:16.555]  Absolutely.
[01:48:16.575 --> 01:48:17.856]  It's a whole planned invasion.
[01:48:18.016 --> 01:48:20.796]  So you start to see things like this.
[01:48:21.237 --> 01:48:25.418]  And one more thing from Ecuador that I will show the audience is this.
[01:48:25.618 --> 01:48:31.159]  This is from a group called R4V, Refugiados de Venezuela.
[01:48:31.199 --> 01:48:34.200]  This is another group that's just totally run by the United Nations.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:35.320]  This is a sub-agency, right?
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:36.720]  They just slap a different name on it.
[01:48:37.861 --> 01:48:41.942]  And this is basically, they call it a migration route map.
[01:48:42.222 --> 01:48:43.582]  And this is just, you know,
[01:48:44.656 --> 01:48:45.437]  Displayed openly.
[01:48:45.677 --> 01:48:57.026]  They hand these little pamphlets out, these little maps like this that you can hold in your hand, but you go to a bus station terminal, for example, down there in Ecuador, and these quote-unquote migration route maps are just publicly displayed, like giant ones that you can snap pictures of.
[01:48:57.046 --> 01:48:58.187]  And they're all over the place.
[01:48:58.487 --> 01:49:08.715]  And it's not just this, I saw ones like this, pictures of them that were of Peru, like they've carved up all of South America and just shown the routes, how to get all the way- And then they offer free welfare, voting,
[01:49:09.355 --> 01:49:11.717]  All these goodies, if you come, that's the real incentive.
[01:49:11.737 --> 01:49:14.659]  Not just these blueprints, but they're saying, come here, everything's free.
[01:49:14.799 --> 01:49:15.079]  Correct.
[01:49:15.219 --> 01:49:15.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:18.121]  I mean, you talk to some of these people, and that's exactly what they're expecting.
[01:49:18.141 --> 01:49:22.364]  They're expecting to get to the United States, and... Yeah, you talk to them, and they say, this is where I'm going, this is where I'm going.
[01:49:22.444 --> 01:49:23.145]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:23.165 --> 01:49:24.126]  Oh, I'm going to Houston, Texas.
[01:49:24.146 --> 01:49:25.066]  I'm going to Los Angeles.
[01:49:25.106 --> 01:49:25.967]  I'm going to Louisiana.
[01:49:25.987 --> 01:49:26.247]  Whatever.
[01:49:26.267 --> 01:49:27.368]  I mean, they're going all over the place.
[01:49:27.708 --> 01:49:27.868]  Right?
[01:49:28.268 --> 01:49:34.112]  And you also ask them, and we should play some of these clips, I sent them to the crew, of these people just straight up chanting for Biden.
[01:49:34.272 --> 01:49:38.715]  And you ask, I have more personal interviews that I'll put in the final documentary, of every person you ask.
[01:49:38.735 --> 01:49:40.517]  You go, well, you know, what do you think about Biden?
[01:49:40.617 --> 01:49:41.337]  Oh, we love Biden.
[01:49:41.978 --> 01:49:44.880]  Poor el apoyo de migrantes, for his support of migrants.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:45.280]  Right?
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.141]  They all know who's running this.
[01:49:47.161 --> 01:49:49.183]  And they know you ask them about, okay, well, what about Trump?
[01:49:49.223 --> 01:49:49.583]  And I'm not
[01:49:49.923 --> 01:49:51.646]  Well that video is a bunch of wearing Biden shirts!
[01:50:03.499 --> 01:50:04.820]  Yeah, I haven't even seen that.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.242]  You haven't seen the illegal aliens wearing Biden shirts?
[01:50:07.282 --> 01:50:08.803]  No, no, no.
[01:50:08.963 --> 01:50:09.343]  Pull it up.
[01:50:09.604 --> 01:50:11.145]  So you sent us a whole bunch of videos.
[01:50:11.185 --> 01:50:15.007]  Chinese, staging hotel, caravan photos, caravan chanting.
[01:50:15.047 --> 01:50:16.969]  Oh, they put the train that you've written on.
[01:50:16.989 --> 01:50:17.609]  That's incredible.
[01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:25.555]  Women carrying incapacitated children that are drugs, the Darien Gap, angry group of military-age Syrian men, truckloads of U.S.
[01:50:25.635 --> 01:50:28.497]  illegals, raided an illegal alien truck.
[01:50:28.597 --> 01:50:29.598]  You also got kidnapped.
[01:50:29.618 --> 01:50:30.579]  Those are the clips I was given.
[01:50:30.819 --> 01:50:31.379]  Yep, yep.
[01:50:31.619 --> 01:50:32.320]  I sent those all to the crew.
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:33.440]  Yeah, so what's the clip you want to play?
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.941]  Let me see that.
[01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.901]  I mean, play the military-age Syrian men.
[01:50:37.622 --> 01:50:45.685]  But let's do that, because I want to explain that, and I want people to see the kind of people that are coming up here, because these are very serious dudes.
[01:50:46.885 --> 01:50:48.146]  Yeah, okay, those guys right there.
[01:50:48.166 --> 01:50:55.649]  So I'm going to explain this, and I'm not... Listen, what I'm going to give you is all the information that I have, and I want the audience at home to come to their own conclusion, okay?
[01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:59.090]  So these men, you can see, they clearly don't want to be on camera.
[01:50:59.190 --> 01:51:03.631]  I filmed this right outside of the San Vicente refugee camp in Panama.
[01:51:03.651 --> 01:51:06.032]  This is right after we left the Darien Gap.
[01:51:06.852 --> 01:51:09.113]  And this is not the first time though that I encountered these men.
[01:51:09.473 --> 01:51:11.634]  I encountered these men... Oh, they all got the same equipment.
[01:51:11.974 --> 01:51:13.595]  It's all issued by the same group.
[01:51:13.635 --> 01:51:14.316]  That's military.
[01:51:41.994 --> 01:51:42.495]  Yep.
[01:51:42.875 --> 01:51:44.776]  And they were sort of friendly to me at first.
[01:51:44.937 --> 01:51:46.037]  You know, they were suspicious.
[01:51:46.078 --> 01:51:46.938]  They were sort of friendly to me.
[01:51:47.379 --> 01:51:49.300]  And some of them actually had tattoos.
[01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:50.901]  And the tattoos were all the same.
[01:51:51.802 --> 01:51:52.763]  That read, Jesus.
[01:51:52.803 --> 01:51:57.167]  They looked like fresh tattoos and fresh tattoos of crucifixes on them.
[01:51:57.287 --> 01:51:57.447]  Right?
[01:51:57.887 --> 01:51:59.288]  And so, this is what I saw.
[01:51:59.328 --> 01:52:00.269]  They all get off this boat.
[01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:02.431]  And they find out that I'm American.
[01:52:02.471 --> 01:52:04.553]  And immediately, these guys get instantly hostile.
[01:52:04.813 --> 01:52:05.474]  Instantly hostile.
[01:52:05.994 --> 01:52:07.515]  And then what's interesting is... What?
[01:52:07.535 --> 01:52:07.976]  Hezbollah?
[01:52:08.616 --> 01:52:12.759]  I mean, I'm not, listen, I'm not gonna, it is what it is, I'm giving you all the information that I have, but could it be?
[01:52:12.839 --> 01:52:13.299]  Absolutely.
[01:52:13.339 --> 01:52:25.427]  I mean, we know that, for example, something's that obvious, newly bought crucifix, all uniform, nobody wears uniform, the same boots, and then they got fresh Christian tattoos, wow, you're in trouble.
[01:52:25.688 --> 01:52:26.088]  Straight up.
[01:52:26.308 --> 01:52:31.772]  And so I, you know, I didn't want to piss these men off, because if I was to piss these men off, it's just me and my brother.
[01:52:31.792 --> 01:52:32.192]  No, I got it.
[01:52:32.392 --> 01:52:33.513]  You've got a lot of courage just doing this.
[01:52:33.573 --> 01:52:35.714]  Oh, they'll, you know, I'll get my throat slit.
[01:52:35.854 --> 01:52:37.254]  And so, we didn't do that.
[01:52:37.314 --> 01:52:46.479]  So then, you know, we're entering the jungle, and we start marching through, and we're, we enter the jungle with a large, very large group of people, mostly Chinese, about 60-70% Chinese.
[01:52:46.519 --> 01:52:49.420]  There was anywhere from 400-500 people in the group that we went in there with.
[01:52:49.721 --> 01:52:52.642]  Then there were, uh... There's the other stage here, and now you go into the jungle.
[01:52:52.722 --> 01:52:53.603]  Now we go into the jungle.
[01:52:53.703 --> 01:53:00.286]  And it was our entire group, the particular route that we took, actually, I have, um, a map, which we'll, which, uh, we're gonna get into this.
[01:53:00.866 --> 01:53:13.235]  Um, but, but, what's interesting about these guys in particular, why I wanted to show that is, we all started in one caravan, and we went to the jungle, and I was talking to my brother, I was like, yeah, I hope we don't run into those Syrians, because we pissed them off, and I don't want to run into these guys when we're in there, because anything could happen.
[01:53:13.715 --> 01:53:14.335]  We never saw them.
[01:53:14.435 --> 01:53:16.957]  We never saw them again, until this happened.
[01:53:17.337 --> 01:53:19.039]  And what's interesting, why am I saying this, because
[01:53:19.719 --> 01:53:22.981]  When we got to this camp, in order for us to get to this camp, we popped down on Highway 1.
[01:53:23.021 --> 01:53:25.842]  We had to go from South to North to get to this camp, okay?
[01:53:26.542 --> 01:53:31.285]  These men, I saw a day later after we got here, they ended up coming from North to South.
[01:53:31.485 --> 01:53:32.205]  So what does that mean?
[01:53:32.245 --> 01:53:36.247]  It means these men, they started at the same places as they took an entirely different route.
[01:53:36.267 --> 01:53:43.111]  These people actually taking different special interest alien routes through the Daring Gap, detached from actually the main caravan, which is pretty incredible.
[01:53:43.131 --> 01:53:44.251]  So what does that mean?
[01:53:44.291 --> 01:53:45.492]  I mean, it can mean any number of things.
[01:53:45.572 --> 01:53:46.853]  Yeah, they actually look military.
[01:53:46.873 --> 01:53:47.653]  They look like veterans.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:34.489]  Actually quite horrifying and um... now let's take a step back so let let let's let's explain the route because that's what i promise the audience i really want you to understand how this works so i said that we were in quito then we went to tolkien then we crossed over and one of the first things we saw when we crossed over if the crew could pull up the video of the chinese staging hotel this is another one we actually stayed at this place by accident this is right across if anybody wants to look up the Antonio Nariño airport
[01:54:34.949 --> 01:54:36.491]  This is impasto Colombia.
[01:54:36.771 --> 01:54:38.653]  We stayed at this hotel here, okay?
[01:54:38.833 --> 01:54:43.438]  And like I said, by accident, we show up and the whole place is just Chinese people.
[01:54:43.478 --> 01:54:45.400]  There were some families, mostly military-aged men.
[01:54:46.401 --> 01:54:48.563]  You know, the signs in this hotel are written in Chinese.
[01:54:48.964 --> 01:54:54.750]  I actually snapped pictures of the logbook going back weeks, which I didn't publish because I'm not Antifa and I'm not going to talk about it.
[01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:55.631]  And I was given a copy of that.
[01:54:55.931 --> 01:54:56.311]  You're giving it?
[01:54:56.371 --> 01:54:56.811]  Okay, good.
[01:54:56.931 --> 01:54:58.432]  So you could verify what I'm saying.
[01:54:59.832 --> 01:55:07.855]  Going back weeks, it's just all Chinese people all headed to either the United States, is what they'll say, or they'll say they're headed to Mexico, which just means they're gonna fly to Mexico and march off if they got the appropriate visa.
[01:55:08.216 --> 01:55:09.036]  But this is what's going on.
[01:55:09.056 --> 01:55:13.258]  I mean, these Chinese are so well-funded, they actually have their own, like, staging hubs.
[01:55:13.458 --> 01:55:19.320]  Well, they'll come, and they'll meet, and then they'll continue onwards, either taking an airplane, or they'll take a bus down to
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:20.981]  The next stop on the map.
[01:55:21.421 --> 01:55:24.704]  So, I want the crew to show this, because I want to show these groups.
[01:55:24.724 --> 01:55:27.106]  They'll try to deny that they're sending people through the Darien Gap.
[01:55:27.907 --> 01:55:30.309]  And I have here a map that I took a picture of.
[01:55:30.329 --> 01:55:34.812]  They wouldn't actually let me get a hold of the physical one like this, unfortunately, but the picture will do.
[01:55:34.993 --> 01:55:35.733]  This is legitimate.
[01:55:35.753 --> 01:55:36.894]  Yeah, we're not on my stuff, guys.
[01:55:36.934 --> 01:55:37.315]  We're over here.
[01:55:37.355 --> 01:55:37.735]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:55:38.095 --> 01:55:39.155]  So, I want people to see this.
[01:55:39.175 --> 01:55:43.277]  So, this is a map that I took a picture of at a highest facility in Nokokli.
[01:55:43.317 --> 01:55:46.238]  That's this border coastal town right here.
[01:55:46.558 --> 01:55:47.778]  This red pinpoint.
[01:55:48.279 --> 01:55:51.780]  Basically, after this Chinese hotel, we went to Nokokli.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:54.741]  And this is like this last town that you go to before you actually get to the Gap.
[01:55:55.241 --> 01:56:00.803]  And I took a picture of this map, and you can see here from this map, these organisms, they try to deny that they're sending people to the jungle.
[01:56:00.823 --> 01:56:03.504]  If you look here, you can literally see boat routes.
[01:56:04.224 --> 01:56:05.245]  And that's where it's taking you to.
[01:56:05.305 --> 01:56:08.007]  It's either taking you to Akande or Copper Ganah.
[01:56:08.047 --> 01:56:14.732]  These are the two Colombian entry points and this is basically the mouth of the gap and then from here you end up marching inwards.
[01:56:14.752 --> 01:56:20.476]  But the point is, you can see, they are literally encouraging people and funneling them to the mouth of the gap and then having them go through.
[01:56:21.397 --> 01:56:22.497]  This is not the route that I took.
[01:56:22.937 --> 01:56:30.039]  This is for the poorer illegal aliens, most of the ones that are coming from South America, like Ecuadorians and Venezuelans and Colombians.
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:31.260]  They're gonna take these routes.
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:32.680]  These routes are incredibly deadly.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:37.782]  Had I taken these routes with my brother, I mean, I might have gotten killed, shot in the head, straight up.
[01:56:37.862 --> 01:56:40.902]  I mean, there's drug mules, all types of bad dudes that are running through here.
[01:56:41.303 --> 01:56:45.664]  Not to say that we didn't see them in the route that we took, but the route that we took is used by special interest aliens.
[01:56:45.784 --> 01:56:45.884]  It's...
[01:56:46.764 --> 01:56:47.384]  Stay there!
[01:56:47.404 --> 01:56:48.225]  This is Mad Max World!
[01:57:15.708 --> 01:57:17.088]  That's why it's MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:57:17.128 --> 01:57:18.409]  I mean, this is going down.
[01:57:18.469 --> 01:57:19.449]  The end of our country.
[01:57:19.889 --> 01:57:20.929]  Tens of millions in Europe.
[01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:24.030]  Tourism down 80% in France.
[01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:24.851]  They don't care.
[01:57:25.311 --> 01:57:26.331]  This is the tech down.
[01:57:26.371 --> 01:57:27.171]  This is the war.
[01:57:27.551 --> 01:57:28.792]  It's not missiles and bombs, folks.
[01:57:28.852 --> 01:57:30.032]  It's fentanyl and allele aliens.
[01:57:30.692 --> 01:57:31.712]  And they're going to activate them.
[01:57:31.732 --> 01:57:32.973]  They all give them cell phones.
[01:57:33.673 --> 01:57:34.713]  And they'll do whatever they're told.
[01:57:34.753 --> 01:57:35.513]  They'll burn this down.
[01:57:35.533 --> 01:57:35.914]  They do it.
[01:57:36.534 --> 01:57:37.074]  This is it.
[01:57:37.254 --> 01:57:38.814]  This is Red Dawn in slow motion.
[01:57:39.455 --> 01:57:44.336]  We'll be back with Anthony Rubin of Muckraker.com, hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:48.673 --> 01:57:57.818]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[01:57:58.298 --> 01:57:59.178]  You would rally against it?
[01:57:59.198 --> 01:57:59.739]  You would fight it?
[01:58:00.119 --> 01:58:01.480]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:03.060]  This is the reality of 2023.
[01:58:04.281 --> 01:58:18.557]  I just want to thank listeners and viewers for your last year's support and want to encourage you now more than ever to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to take clips and share it from the broadcast, and to buy products that enrich your life at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:58:19.318 --> 01:58:25.642]  We have the signed or unsigned copy of my new book, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalist and Launch the Second Renaissance.
[01:58:26.082 --> 01:58:31.326]  Twice as long as my last book, incredibly powerful, signed or unsigned, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:31.706 --> 01:58:35.809]  And we have X2, finally back in stock after over a year, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:36.029 --> 01:58:41.252]  We have TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, back in stock, and a bunch of other great products as well.
[01:58:41.532 --> 01:58:45.255]  So please visit InfoWarsTore.com and do your Christmas shopping there.
[01:58:45.555 --> 01:58:48.057]  Fund the InfoWar and get great products all at the same time.
[01:58:49.077 --> 01:58:54.543]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:58:55.284 --> 01:58:59.569]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:58:59.969 --> 01:59:04.354]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:05.775 --> 01:59:08.557]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:59:08.838 --> 01:59:09.959]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:59:10.399 --> 01:59:15.823]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:59:16.364 --> 01:59:21.788]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:25.151]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:59:27.043 --> 01:59:27.323]  I know.
[01:59:27.964 --> 01:59:31.045]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[01:59:31.365 --> 01:59:34.547]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[01:59:34.907 --> 01:59:39.990]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:40.950]  It is amazing.
[01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:47.293]  It's the Missing Link X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:47.713 --> 01:59:48.114]  X2.
[01:59:50.435 --> 01:59:56.338]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.887 --> 02:00:03.292]  Nobody was in charge, and that's a really distressing thing to think about.
[02:00:03.612 --> 02:00:10.341]  At a television network, you want to have stars on screen, you want to have people behind the scenes producing, and executives who are holding everybody responsible.
[02:00:10.661 --> 02:00:12.223]  That just isn't how it works at Fox.
[02:00:12.523 --> 02:00:16.328]  I know at CNN, if I went on the air and I started lying about something, I'd be held accountable.
[02:00:16.989 --> 02:00:23.212]  At CNN you lied about many things and I'm amazed that you can sit here with a straight face and say what you just said.
[02:00:23.713 --> 02:00:26.794]  I mean on your failure of a show you called reliable sources.
[02:00:27.194 --> 02:00:30.216]  You constantly called Trump supporters the cult of Trump.
[02:00:30.496 --> 02:00:32.417]  You spread the Russia hoax for years.
[02:00:32.637 --> 02:00:35.599]  You called the Hunter Biden story a manufactured story.
[02:00:35.839 --> 02:00:39.661]  Basically you called every story that you didn't like wide-wing disinformation.
[02:00:39.901 --> 02:00:41.002]  And I can go on and on.
[02:00:41.383 --> 02:00:43.465]  So have some self-respect in front of these people.
[02:00:43.885 --> 02:00:46.467]  Realize why your ratings went down the toilet.
[02:00:46.888 --> 02:00:49.891]  And I'm not gonna call you a Mr. Potato Head because that's a cheap shot.
[02:00:59.339 --> 02:01:08.163]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[02:01:09.783 --> 02:01:14.305]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[02:01:14.345 --> 02:01:15.765]  We will bring an end to it.
[02:01:15.945 --> 02:01:22.948]  How will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?
[02:01:24.048 --> 02:01:25.409]  I promise you we'll be able to do it.
[02:01:26.095 --> 02:01:27.560]  Tonight, sabotage at sea.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:31.852]  That's what President Biden is calling the leaks and explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines.
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:41.103]  Like a boiling cauldron, the busy Baltic Sea bursting with gas from ruptured Russian Nord Stream reinforced pipelines.
[02:01:41.243 --> 02:01:55.308]  First on CNN, sources telling us that European security officials observed Russian Navy ships earlier this week in the vicinity of those leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines that were likely caused by underwater explosions.
[02:01:55.568 --> 02:01:56.068]  Here's what we know.
[02:01:56.288 --> 02:02:03.014]  We know that Russian support ships, Russian Navy support ships were spotted in the vicinity of the leaks on these pipelines.
[02:02:03.035 --> 02:02:09.681]  We were also told by a source familiar with the intelligence that Russian submarines were spotted in the general area last week.
[02:02:09.801 --> 02:02:17.729]  I think this is clearly an act of sabotage of some sort and Russia is certainly the most likely suspect.
[02:02:18.089 --> 02:02:19.751]  It's incredibly alarming.
[02:02:19.912 --> 02:02:27.021]  President Vladimir Putin has blamed the United States and its allies for blowing up the undersea Nord Stream pipelines.
[02:02:27.181 --> 02:02:33.150]  It was a deliberate act of sabotage, and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation and lies.
[02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:36.571]  If Russia wanted to shut off the pipeline, they would flip the button.
[02:02:36.591 --> 02:02:37.591]  They would twist the knob.
[02:02:37.651 --> 02:02:38.912]  They don't need to blow it up.
[02:02:38.972 --> 02:02:39.392]  It's theirs.
[02:02:39.492 --> 02:02:40.853]  It starts in Russia.
[02:02:41.113 --> 02:02:44.134]  So it's pretty obvious to us the Biden administration was involved in this.
[02:02:44.194 --> 02:02:46.414]  They have been lying to us all along about this.
[02:02:46.454 --> 02:02:53.617]  There's no way the United States was not either involved or knew about this or at the very minimum approved it.
[02:02:53.877 --> 02:02:54.938]  Today, a senior U.S.
[02:02:54.978 --> 02:02:58.680]  government official rejected a new claim by Russia's defense minister.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.864]  He claimed that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb with Western help on its own territory.
[02:03:06.204 --> 02:03:11.187]  This is the first time the 101st Airborne Division has deployed to Europe since World War II.
[02:03:11.207 --> 02:03:19.733]  The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews
[02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:27.139]  Just understand, and don't kid yourself no matter what you all say, that's called World War 3.
[02:03:27.439 --> 02:03:29.221]  The U.S.
[02:03:29.341 --> 02:03:41.011]  will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war, and they will have to fight, and they will be dying.
[02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:50.222]  Air sirens blaring across much of central and eastern Ukraine today as Putin's forces ramp up.
[02:03:50.342 --> 02:03:54.947]  Washington has placed more than 8,000 U.S.-based troops on a heightened state of alert.
[02:03:55.187 --> 02:03:56.269]  Today, the U.S.
[02:03:56.329 --> 02:04:01.434]  sent in the cavalry, bound for Romania right along the Ukrainian border.
[02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:05.458]  If we continue down this path, we may end up with a nuclear holocaust.
[02:04:18.328 --> 02:04:19.688]  CNN has learned that the U.S.
[02:04:19.768 --> 02:04:29.271]  is developing contingency plans for possible Russian escalation in its war in Ukraine, including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:04:29.591 --> 02:04:31.911]  Russian President Vladimir Putin today making it official.
[02:04:31.991 --> 02:04:37.612]  He just formally suspended Russia's involvement in its last remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the United States.
[02:04:37.632 --> 02:04:44.334]  The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.
[02:04:44.694 --> 02:04:51.181]  Every actuary, every historic war game, every analysis shows this leads to total thermal nuclear war.
[02:04:59.108 --> 02:05:02.030]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:08.213]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.
[02:05:08.393 --> 02:05:18.159]  That's why we bring you the very best products, so you love them, so you enjoy them, as you come back and get them again and again, so we can stay on the air in the fight against the globalists, because it's viewers like you that keep this operation on air.
[02:05:18.599 --> 02:05:19.200]  And here we are.
[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:20.120]  Another Christmas is here.
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:21.721]  Being the biggest sale of the year.

[02:05:53.462 --> 02:05:56.684]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:56.824 --> 02:06:13.954]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:32.836 --> 02:06:37.519]  We have millions of new listeners and viewers that are tuned in today.
[02:06:37.539 --> 02:06:39.740]  I want to welcome you all here.
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:48.425]  I have got interviews on British TV, Japanese TV, Russian TV, U.S.
[02:06:48.445 --> 02:06:49.606]  television the last few days.
[02:06:50.686 --> 02:06:53.448]  And these live shows, some of them are huge.
[02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:58.572]  Are just like, well, how do we know what you're saying is true?
[02:06:58.592 --> 02:07:06.115]  And I'm like, Klaus Schwab says they're gonna make us eat bugs, and get rid of our borders, and take control of our lives, and they want world government.
[02:07:07.176 --> 02:07:09.577]  You don't need to believe me when I say this stuff, look it up.
[02:07:10.117 --> 02:07:10.858]  Here's a great example.
[02:07:12.118 --> 02:07:13.019]  Insight, Reuters.
[02:07:13.699 --> 02:07:16.900]  Refugees lack COVID shots because drug makers for lawsuits documents show.
[02:07:17.861 --> 02:07:19.762]  They went around and got all the drug makers,
[02:07:22.534 --> 02:07:29.037]  They went out and got all the major governments to sign on to give them liability protection before they even did it.
[02:07:30.178 --> 02:07:31.779]  So they got big plans for these illegals.
[02:07:31.799 --> 02:07:38.622]  They bring them in, they hook them up with lawyers, whether it's in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, it doesn't matter, it's the same plan, same blueprint.
[02:07:39.923 --> 02:07:46.946]  And they then skim their paychecks, skim their welfare, and farm them like leftists do homeless people.
[02:07:47.487 --> 02:07:48.547]  It's a whole industry.
[02:07:49.388 --> 02:07:50.508]  It's a gold mine.
[02:07:50.588 --> 02:07:52.089]  It's a crop they're farming.
[02:07:54.264 --> 02:08:10.277]  So I want to get back into, with a great investigative journalist, Anthony Rubin of muckraker.com, the rest of what he's breaking down, what he's witnessed, what he's seen, but then the political aspect of this, and Soros and the State Department, the debit cards they give them, I mean, that's been out forever.
[02:08:10.677 --> 02:08:23.408]  I played a clip when you first came on of Jon Stewart going, and this is five, six years ago in the midterm before Trump got the election stolen from him, going, Trump's insane, there's no caravans, there's no illegals, none of this is happening.
[02:08:24.562 --> 02:08:32.006]  Now we've moved past that with Majorca saying, oh, we have heightened terror alert, a heightened terror threat amid war in the Middle East and immigration crisis.
[02:08:32.526 --> 02:08:36.488]  Brace for terror attacks, the FBI director says.
[02:08:37.648 --> 02:08:40.770]  And they think we're dumb when the terror attack comes.
[02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:41.750]  We won't blame them.
[02:08:42.171 --> 02:08:44.272]  So this is an insane moment.
[02:08:44.832 --> 02:08:46.793]  And then we have these documents released in New York.
[02:08:47.895 --> 02:08:51.057]  Where the state legislature is preparing to legalize illegals voting.
[02:08:51.577 --> 02:08:53.319]  I mean, this is very transparent.
[02:08:53.439 --> 02:08:53.679]  Yeah.
[02:08:54.199 --> 02:08:54.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:57.621]  Well, it is replacement migration.
[02:08:57.662 --> 02:09:01.584]  These people cannot win politically legitimately.
[02:09:01.784 --> 02:09:02.745]  It's impossible at this point.
[02:09:02.765 --> 02:09:03.806]  I think that everybody's waking up.
[02:09:03.846 --> 02:09:05.527]  It is kind of a great awakening that's going on.
[02:09:05.547 --> 02:09:08.989]  We've already seen with your reinstatement on X, thanks to Elon Musk.
[02:09:09.129 --> 02:09:11.991]  I don't think that the powers that be can allow that to stand.
[02:09:12.031 --> 02:09:15.273]  I think there's way too much now, you know, counterforce against them.
[02:09:15.553 --> 02:09:17.575]  And I think, I mean, similar to what you were talking about before,
[02:09:18.395 --> 02:09:28.899]  You know, there's going to be some sort of either cyber attack or major military escalation or something of the like to put up the brakes on this because people are waking up to what's going on.
[02:09:29.199 --> 02:09:30.940]  But yeah, we are being completely invaded.
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:42.584]  You take, for example, what's going on, the statement that Senator Dick Durbin made about making these people soldiers in the military and sending them overseas and then for their service we're going to give them citizenship.
[02:09:42.904 --> 02:09:48.347]  You couple that now with all of this, what you were just reporting on, this demonization of white people.
[02:09:48.387 --> 02:09:50.128]  We're all domestic terrorists.
[02:09:50.209 --> 02:09:53.851]  Joe Biden continues to say the greatest threat to our country is white supremacy.
[02:09:54.251 --> 02:09:55.072]  Whatever that even means.
[02:09:55.132 --> 02:09:56.232]  I mean, I don't even know what that means.
[02:09:56.312 --> 02:09:58.233]  How is he defining a white supremacist?
[02:09:58.314 --> 02:09:59.454]  Am I a white supremacist?
[02:09:59.674 --> 02:10:00.635]  Well, what's a white supremacist?
[02:10:00.895 --> 02:10:03.837]  But that's what they continue to say, and it's pre-genocide talk.
[02:10:03.977 --> 02:10:10.101]  If you look at how genocides happen and happen in the preconditioning that takes place, it's the same type of rhetoric, and that's what's going on.
[02:10:10.421 --> 02:10:11.542]  And so now you couple that
[02:10:12.262 --> 02:10:41.326]  With this mass third world army that's coming in and I'm not even saying, I want to make myself explicitly clear so that I cannot be misrepresented by anybody, that I'm not saying that these people are coming in here, I mean some of them are, certainly coming in with sinister intent, but I'm not saying that the masses of these Venezuelans that you see, or these Ecuadorians, or these Haitians, aren't necessarily coming in here to, you know, be death squad members, that's not what I'm saying, but when times get desperate, when the power does get shut off, when the dollar does collapse, when you can't even get a loaf of bread to put on the table,
[02:10:42.006 --> 02:10:44.709]  Well, we know the cartels are already pre-war gaming this.
[02:10:45.009 --> 02:10:46.651]  Pelosi says they're all God's children.
[02:10:46.671 --> 02:10:48.012]  The point is, it's a permanent underclass.
[02:10:48.513 --> 02:10:52.357]  They can exploit and control who they order to vote this way, or you get deported.
[02:10:52.637 --> 02:10:52.978]  Correct.
[02:10:52.998 --> 02:10:58.804]  You see them all chanting for Biden, and the point is that when SHTF, I'm just keeping it appropriate for the radio,
[02:10:59.504 --> 02:11:02.767]  Um, these people are going to be basically a controlled class.
[02:11:03.068 --> 02:11:05.370]  He who pays the piper plays the tune, right?
[02:11:05.610 --> 02:11:06.270]  Who's the piper?
[02:11:06.471 --> 02:11:10.614]  It's all these 10 million people that are probably more that have come under just under Joe Biden.
[02:11:10.674 --> 02:11:11.695]  Who's paying them?
[02:11:11.875 --> 02:11:12.916]  It's Uncle Sam.
[02:11:13.076 --> 02:11:19.322]  It's these, uh, these horrible corrupt politicians that are then going to... Can you even believe how obvious this is?
[02:11:19.903 --> 02:11:21.324]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:11:21.784 --> 02:11:25.127]  If you don't know what's going on at this point, I'm not sure what rock you're living on.
[02:11:25.147 --> 02:11:28.990]  And I'm not trying to sound condescending, but like, I don't, it's so expressly obvious.
[02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:31.352]  Talk about the beef training, you've been on that.
[02:11:31.452 --> 02:11:35.235]  Describe, you know, this is all, Mexico says you can come through here, just don't stay here.
[02:11:35.475 --> 02:11:37.637]  Mexico is, that country is sketchy.
[02:11:37.737 --> 02:11:43.542]  I would rather be in the jungle than in Mexico, at least the areas in Mexico where these quote-unquote migrantes are going through.
[02:11:44.142 --> 02:11:45.703]  Um, let me just take you through Mexico.
[02:11:45.923 --> 02:11:46.823]  Let me just take you back.
[02:11:46.843 --> 02:11:48.044]  By the way, I don't know if I have the clip here.
[02:11:48.084 --> 02:11:49.504]  Do we have the beast train in your list?
[02:11:49.984 --> 02:11:50.865]  Um, there should be a clip.
[02:11:50.885 --> 02:11:52.085]  That was the one clip I wanted.
[02:11:52.105 --> 02:11:53.065]  It was you on the beast train.
[02:11:53.165 --> 02:11:54.046]  Yeah, there should be a clip in there.
[02:11:54.066 --> 02:11:56.307]  So if you go to his Twitter, guys, it's it's Muckraker.
[02:11:56.327 --> 02:11:59.008]  We'll, we'll, we'll have that or we'll add it and post later.
[02:11:59.028 --> 02:11:59.928]  But just describe this.
[02:12:00.148 --> 02:12:04.831]  Yeah, so, so, you know, I rode the Beast train two times, there it is, that was the first time I rode it.
[02:12:04.851 --> 02:12:05.851]  I actually rode it twice.
[02:12:06.392 --> 02:12:10.394]  And there's photos of it, just thousands hanging off.
[02:12:10.474 --> 02:12:11.394]  Thousands hanging off.
[02:12:11.454 --> 02:12:12.235]  It was insane.
[02:12:12.955 --> 02:12:16.017]  Let me explain this, how this operates.
[02:12:16.077 --> 02:12:23.641]  So, we get on the train, we go to this town called Iroquoito, okay, that's in Mexico, and here I have another document.
[02:12:23.681 --> 02:12:26.163]  Like I said, I came with all of the receipts.
[02:12:26.863 --> 02:12:27.163]  Boom!
[02:12:27.663 --> 02:12:30.684]  Here is an NGO, Amigos del Tren, okay?
[02:12:30.824 --> 02:12:35.005]  This is in, they actually, they have different offices, but their big one is in Irapato, Mexico.
[02:12:35.645 --> 02:12:36.405]  And that's right here.
[02:12:36.505 --> 02:12:36.725]  Boom!
[02:12:36.845 --> 02:12:37.786]  This is like their headquarters.
[02:12:38.306 --> 02:12:47.428]  And from here, we ended up, we got these maps, and they straight up, like, hand these things out, and not far from where that, and that NGO is located literally right on the train tracks, okay?
[02:12:48.248 --> 02:12:49.289]  From there, you wait.
[02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:51.331]  And you wait until, like, 1 in the morning.
[02:12:51.451 --> 02:12:53.173]  And then everybody starts walking down the tracks.
[02:12:53.193 --> 02:12:53.433]  Okay?
[02:12:53.493 --> 02:12:55.536]  And you walk down the tracks for maybe a mile.
[02:12:55.976 --> 02:13:05.846]  And then eventually you see, like, even more people that are- that were already down there waiting, and then you're part of- all of a sudden, you've, like, all these different groups combined, and you're part of, like, over, like, multiple thousands of people, possibly.
[02:13:05.866 --> 02:13:08.068]  Guys, just type in photos, Mexico's Beast Train.
[02:13:08.088 --> 02:13:09.510]  Just click images, it'll show it.
[02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:09.750]  Go ahead.
[02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:11.291]  And this is happening in the middle of the night.
[02:13:11.311 --> 02:13:12.451]  This is the first time I wrote it.
[02:13:12.511 --> 02:13:17.133]  I wrote it two times with my brother because the cartel took our Mexican footage.
[02:13:17.153 --> 02:13:19.474]  We actually had to fly back into Mexico and ride this sucker again.
[02:13:20.435 --> 02:13:22.356]  Even more sketchy the second time for different reasons.
[02:13:22.656 --> 02:13:27.898]  But the first time we get on this thing, middle of the night, we're all walking down the tracks now to find this quote-unquote beast train.
[02:13:28.398 --> 02:13:29.959]  And you start to see these men.
[02:13:29.999 --> 02:13:32.040]  And I'm thinking these might be Mexican police officers.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:34.921]  And he realized real quick, these are not Mexican police officers.
[02:13:34.941 --> 02:13:36.021]  These are actually cartel men.
[02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:47.986]  I'm looking at them, and if anybody's ever seen Batman, the one from the early 2000s with the League of Shadows guys, where they're dressed in all black with like the ninja face mask that only shows their eyes and the body armor and the sword tucked behind their back.
[02:13:48.306 --> 02:13:49.266]  Literally, they had all of that.
[02:13:49.286 --> 02:13:51.927]  They literally had swords tucked in their back behind their body armor.
[02:13:52.128 --> 02:13:54.148]  They're all carrying shotguns and AR-15s.
[02:13:54.568 --> 02:13:56.429]  And these are the men that load us up onto the train.
[02:13:57.009 --> 02:13:58.130]  It's totally insane.
[02:13:58.470 --> 02:14:00.991]  And so, I've- And then once you get there, they shake you down.
[02:14:01.692 --> 02:14:07.120]  Well, if you take it to its definitive end, that's right, if you take this thing all the way up to... South Texas.
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:07.640]  Yes.
[02:14:07.861 --> 02:14:09.002]  I mean, it goes all along here.
[02:14:10.164 --> 02:14:16.874]  But, you know, anywhere at its definitive end, you will be met by the same men and they'll take you off and they'll haul you to the border and, of course, extort you if you don't pay them.
[02:14:17.574 --> 02:14:18.154]  That's what's going on.
[02:14:18.454 --> 02:14:20.415]  There's so many aspects of this, I don't want to get sidetracked.
[02:14:20.435 --> 02:14:32.758]  Like, one point I do want to make, I just don't want to forget, is that you have the United Nations running this whole thing, and you talk to anybody, and certainly if you talk to any of these leftist politicians or congressmen, they'll be like, oh, it's for humanitarian purposes, you're just a bigot or a racist.
[02:14:32.858 --> 02:14:35.099]  It's on screen, they dress like ninjas from League of S.T.A.T.S.
[02:14:35.119 --> 02:14:37.640]  That is straight up what, I swear to you that's what they look like.
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:40.922]  Except they were also carrying shotguns or AR-15s.
[02:14:41.042 --> 02:14:42.482]  I am not exaggerating to you.
[02:14:42.783 --> 02:14:44.183]  Those are the men that loaded us onto the train.
[02:14:44.383 --> 02:14:44.744]  That's that.
[02:14:44.764 --> 02:14:45.584]  You found footage of them.
[02:14:45.984 --> 02:14:47.525]  With the sword tucked in their back as well.
[02:14:48.306 --> 02:14:49.106]  Totally the same sight.
[02:14:49.146 --> 02:14:50.107]  Maybe they got that from there.
[02:14:50.127 --> 02:14:50.507]  I'm not sure.
[02:14:50.567 --> 02:14:52.988]  You were talking before about how movies like it pre-programs people.
[02:14:53.208 --> 02:14:54.209]  I mean, that's what it was all about.
[02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:55.290]  Well, they don't want to make noise.
[02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.970]  They got to stab you.
[02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.770]  That's why they got swords.
[02:14:59.072 --> 02:14:59.853]  That's incredible.
[02:15:01.194 --> 02:15:04.897]  Well, what I want to say is this, though, and again, I'm just giving people... This is war.
[02:15:04.917 --> 02:15:11.222]  I mean, this is why, you know, we see movies about war and we go, look, it looks like war because that's movies copying war.
[02:15:11.282 --> 02:15:11.863]  This is war.
[02:15:12.263 --> 02:15:12.884]  Straight up war.
[02:15:12.924 --> 02:15:14.285]  This is weaponized migration.
[02:15:14.345 --> 02:15:15.266]  We are being replaced.
[02:15:15.386 --> 02:15:19.249]  What I want to say is this, though, for anybody out there,
[02:15:19.349 --> 02:15:25.332]  You know, maybe, maybe you go and you're going to take this, the information from this broadcast and you're going to say, wow, I learned some incredible stuff.
[02:15:25.372 --> 02:15:26.452]  We actually are being invaded.
[02:15:26.712 --> 02:15:27.593]  We got to do something about this.
[02:15:27.613 --> 02:15:30.154]  And then somebody is going to come back and they're going to say, well, what do you mean, man?
[02:15:30.194 --> 02:15:31.834]  It's a humanitarian operation.
[02:15:31.874 --> 02:15:36.737]  That's why they're giving them these maps and instructions and sending them up here because they're coming from horrible countries.
[02:15:36.857 --> 02:15:37.157]  Okay.
[02:15:38.017 --> 02:15:38.757]  That's what you want to believe.
[02:15:39.057 --> 02:15:41.078]  So, I would ask this question.
[02:15:41.158 --> 02:15:55.262]  Why on earth, if this was a humanitarian operation, would the United Nations send these people to parts of, I mean, honestly, all of Central America, but certainly Mexico definitively, that are all controlled by these different cartel organizations, which are literally terrorist groups.
[02:15:55.282 --> 02:15:59.504]  I mean, these are narco-terrorists that put out videos of them chopping off enemy cartel members' heads.
[02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:01.324]  I mean, they're as brutal as ISIS, right?
[02:16:01.364 --> 02:16:02.905]  But we're not going to do anything about them, of course.
[02:16:04.005 --> 02:16:10.571]  Well, if this was humanitarian, why would we send them into the arms of these cartel groups that I, you know, have definitively encountered?
[02:16:10.951 --> 02:16:11.531]  Brutal people.
[02:16:11.551 --> 02:16:18.998]  Hey guys, type in Amnesty International, 80, I think it's 88%, 80% of women and girls raped on way to the U.S.
[02:16:19.038 --> 02:16:19.318]  border.
[02:16:19.939 --> 02:16:24.562]  If it's like 10 years old, just click web and type Amnesty International, 80% of
[02:16:27.825 --> 02:16:28.905]  Migrant women raped.
[02:16:29.206 --> 02:16:29.886]  Just pull that up.
[02:16:30.046 --> 02:16:30.266]  Go ahead.
[02:16:30.366 --> 02:16:30.686]  Keep going.
[02:16:31.166 --> 02:16:34.247]  And so the point is, when I say all this, the point is it's not humanitarian.
[02:16:34.307 --> 02:16:35.548]  These people are being used as pawns.
[02:16:35.568 --> 02:16:36.308]  I'm going to give you a look.
[02:16:36.328 --> 02:16:36.408]  Move.
[02:16:36.428 --> 02:16:36.668]  See it?
[02:16:36.748 --> 02:16:36.908]  Look.
[02:16:37.728 --> 02:16:38.448]  There it is right there.
[02:16:39.189 --> 02:16:40.489]  Yeah, I mean, I believe it.
[02:16:40.989 --> 02:16:47.051]  I've had women, I've talked to women and interviewed them and even just talked to them personally when I didn't feel it was appropriate to put a camera in their face.
[02:16:47.071 --> 02:16:48.592]  You don't always want to do that.
[02:16:49.012 --> 02:16:53.833]  And who just openly told me like, you know, yeah, I was raped by, you know, a group of men in the jungle.
[02:16:54.274 --> 02:16:54.414]  Right?
[02:16:56.014 --> 02:17:03.783]  Horrible stuff it's it's like hell on earth, but let me show you this dead bodies dead bodies the route that we took there are dead bodies We didn't see any a lot of times.
[02:17:03.803 --> 02:17:07.146]  They just get washed downriver But that you know the Colombian route.
[02:17:07.166 --> 02:17:16.256]  You'll see them all over the place because it's a much longer route I want to show somebody there is show people what's going on here, so this is the same This is the back of that Red Cross map
[02:17:16.897 --> 02:17:18.238]  We were just talking about the Beast Train.
[02:17:18.778 --> 02:17:25.321]  Again, just to prove this is not humanitarian, they literally talk about here, they encourage people to ride on top of freight trains.
[02:17:25.361 --> 02:17:34.104]  It says, avoid getting onto a freight train or vehicle if you have not eaten or rested or if you are under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or medication that can make you drowsy.
[02:17:34.124 --> 02:17:36.245]  It's not saying don't do this under any circumstances.
[02:17:36.545 --> 02:17:39.407]  Just make sure that you're not on drugs or you haven't had too many beers.
[02:17:40.487 --> 02:17:42.068]  If you go to sleep, you could fall.
[02:17:42.728 --> 02:17:45.889]  Take it in turns with your travel companions to rest and watch each other.
[02:17:45.909 --> 02:17:48.809]  I mean, this is just so ridiculous that they're telling people to do this, right?
[02:17:49.249 --> 02:17:50.189]  They're being used as pawns.
[02:17:51.550 --> 02:17:57.011]  I mean, you know, I almost want to take a step back, but I know we're limited.
[02:17:57.031 --> 02:18:01.832]  The only reason globalists care, we got plenty of time, is they want to sign them up for welfare and milk them.
[02:18:02.412 --> 02:18:03.272]  They don't care about them.
[02:18:03.292 --> 02:18:04.892]  They just want to stay alive, get up here.
[02:18:04.912 --> 02:18:05.672]  You don't have to take the shot.
[02:18:05.692 --> 02:18:06.713]  That's for the Americans.
[02:18:06.733 --> 02:18:07.233]  We're killing them.
[02:18:07.273 --> 02:18:08.213]  Don't worry, we're replacing them.
[02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:08.493]  Yeah.
[02:18:09.173 --> 02:18:28.194]  Yeah, it's truly horrifying, you know, once you actually take down the smoke screen in your mind, and you really grapple with the question, which is, any government that would do this to us, that would allow 10 million of these people that are desperate, that aren't, you know, necessarily contributing anything to our country, some of them may be okay, but most of them... But it's all organized by the State Department and the government.
[02:18:28.214 --> 02:18:28.574]  The U.S.
[02:18:28.614 --> 02:18:29.235]  government runs this.
[02:18:29.595 --> 02:18:31.656]  But everybody at home, grapple with that question.
[02:18:31.716 --> 02:18:36.157]  Ask yourself, what is the endgame of any government that would allow this to take place and do this to us?
[02:18:36.837 --> 02:18:37.757]  Total lawlessness.
[02:18:37.837 --> 02:18:38.677]  Total lawlessness.
[02:18:38.917 --> 02:18:39.397]  Anarchy.
[02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:43.258]  And then from that anarchy, we can get a totalitarian state built on top of it.
[02:18:43.638 --> 02:18:44.378]  That's what's going on.
[02:18:45.299 --> 02:18:46.479]  I almost feel... You want to take a step back?
[02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:46.739]  Go ahead.
[02:18:46.899 --> 02:18:47.259]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:47.499 --> 02:18:52.820]  I mean, it's sad because I almost feel like I'm standing and just reporting on a house burning down.
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:53.300]  No, I agree.
[02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:53.740]  You feel guilty.
[02:18:53.761 --> 02:18:55.481]  Even though you're trying to stop it, it's like...
[02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:57.022]  You're reporting on it.
[02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:57.562]  It's like hard.
[02:18:57.582 --> 02:18:58.563]  I have that same feeling.
[02:18:58.603 --> 02:19:00.605]  Yeah, and it's like, it's like here I am with the microphone.
[02:19:00.625 --> 02:19:01.105]  There's the house.
[02:19:01.326 --> 02:19:02.286]  Oh, there goes the balcony.
[02:19:02.407 --> 02:19:03.728]  It's like, oh, the roof just imploded.
[02:19:03.768 --> 02:19:05.249]  And it's like, but nothing's happening.
[02:19:05.269 --> 02:19:06.330]  It's like the fire department isn't here.
[02:19:06.350 --> 02:19:09.773]  And I'm just saying how bad the destruction of this house is, but I can't do anything about it.
[02:19:09.813 --> 02:19:15.338]  It's actually very sad and kind of overwhelming at times, but we can't get, uh, you know, we have to also feel blessed that we're in the driver's seat.
[02:19:15.358 --> 02:19:17.480]  We could hopefully affect some change and turn the ship around.
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:19.802]  So in that aspect, we should feel blessed.
[02:19:20.962 --> 02:19:29.324]  Let me say this, so let me take it back to the route, because I want people to understand and walk away from this, understanding kind of the Daring Gap a little bit more and what's going on there.
[02:19:29.344 --> 02:19:35.125]  So, the Daring Gap, I'm sure your audience is well aware of what it is, but I know you've got a lot of new listeners now, so let me just explain this.
[02:19:35.165 --> 02:19:37.745]  This is the strip of land that connects North and South America.
[02:19:38.045 --> 02:19:39.006]  It's lawless jungle.
[02:19:39.106 --> 02:19:41.046]  It was designed like that for a reason.
[02:19:41.066 --> 02:19:45.267]  There's a reason why they didn't take Highway 1, which runs from Alaska all the way down to the southern tip of Panama.
[02:19:46.047 --> 02:19:49.791]  There's a reason why they didn't take that all the way through into South America.
[02:19:49.871 --> 02:19:51.973]  It was designed basically to be a buffer zone if there's an outbreak.
[02:19:51.993 --> 02:19:54.736]  Because Central and South America have had so many wars, disease.
[02:19:54.916 --> 02:19:55.357]  Exactly.
[02:19:55.497 --> 02:19:57.079]  Wars, disease, movement of people.
[02:19:57.119 --> 02:20:02.865]  You could easily chop off any such, you know, issues basically and keep it sequestered either to North America.
[02:20:02.905 --> 02:20:05.207]  America's a lot safer because we have the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.
[02:20:05.347 --> 02:20:05.707]  That's true.
[02:20:06.008 --> 02:20:06.948]  That's absolutely true.
[02:20:07.208 --> 02:20:10.470]  But so the point is, this was designed as Lawless Jungle for a reason.
[02:20:10.531 --> 02:20:12.772]  So we don't want a mega highway going through here.
[02:20:12.792 --> 02:20:17.995]  But what's happened since the border's been opened up is this has turned into a mass illegal alien highway.
[02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:22.599]  And so everybody's just basically marching through here, thousands per day, all the way up to the United States.
[02:20:22.659 --> 02:20:26.141]  Now, I want people to understand, there are these, there's different routes.
[02:20:26.201 --> 02:20:27.722]  There's two that enter from Colombia.
[02:20:27.762 --> 02:20:35.107]  These are extremely long, three to five days, dead bodies everywhere, people getting raped, people getting robbed, coming out of the other end, you know, barely alive.
[02:20:35.607 --> 02:20:36.687]  Then there are other routes.
[02:20:36.807 --> 02:20:40.048]  Now, the route that I took, which is not even listed on this map here.
[02:20:40.688 --> 02:20:41.908]  It's not even listed on this map here.
[02:20:42.228 --> 02:20:44.589]  The route that I took was a more safe route.
[02:20:44.669 --> 02:20:46.589]  It's a route that's used by SIAs.
[02:20:47.010 --> 02:20:51.631]  Anybody that reads the literature behind this whole Southern Border Invasion will see that acronym used.
[02:20:51.911 --> 02:20:53.891]  That stands for Special Interest Alien.
[02:20:53.911 --> 02:20:55.991]  That includes people from China, for example.
[02:20:56.051 --> 02:20:58.392]  Wealthier people, but also the aid workers use it.
[02:20:59.512 --> 02:21:03.573]  Yes, I mean, this is also people that are coming from, you know, countries that have a history of sponsoring terrorist groups.
[02:21:03.753 --> 02:21:06.474]  I mean, dangerous people, possibly.
[02:21:07.034 --> 02:21:09.855]  Now, the route that I took, basically, is not one of these.
[02:21:10.075 --> 02:21:11.395]  It's used by wealthier aliens.
[02:21:11.415 --> 02:21:21.097]  The reason why it's used by wealthier aliens is because they need to get on a boat and get smuggled in the middle of the night into Panamanian territory and land somewhere up here, okay?
[02:21:21.617 --> 02:21:22.757]  And that's the route that we took.
[02:21:22.877 --> 02:21:24.858]  And so we went to this coastal town.
[02:21:25.818 --> 02:21:28.679]  And we basically were staged there with mostly Chinese.
[02:21:28.699 --> 02:21:32.220]  We grew about 500, but anywhere from 60 to 70 percent Chinese.
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.521]  There were Syrians with us.
[02:21:33.561 --> 02:21:34.701]  There were Afghans with us.
[02:21:35.001 --> 02:21:36.722]  There were some people from Ethiopia there.
[02:21:37.302 --> 02:21:39.162]  Ecuadorians, Venezuelans, Colombians.
[02:21:39.823 --> 02:21:41.363]  And we all marched through.
[02:21:41.383 --> 02:21:49.846]  And, you know, I guess the point that I'm trying to make here is that, you know, the Daring Gap now has become so carved up that you actually have different
[02:21:50.306 --> 02:21:51.967]  All these different routes leading through here.
[02:21:51.987 --> 02:21:53.687]  It's not just that like it's one route.
[02:21:53.747 --> 02:21:55.087]  It's no, you know, you got a little bit more money.
[02:21:55.367 --> 02:21:57.288]  Okay, well, we're gonna smuggle you into Panama and take you in this way.
[02:21:57.308 --> 02:22:06.670]  There's actually another route a little bit further north where if you have even more money, you can pay smugglers and they'll actually take you on a horseback ride and you'll ride horseback all the way inland.
[02:22:06.990 --> 02:22:07.471]  It's incredible.
[02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:08.311]  Um...
[02:22:09.181 --> 02:22:14.422]  But I just want people to understand what's going on there and basically how, you know, Panama is being overrun with these people.
[02:22:14.782 --> 02:22:20.863]  And then once they're in Panama, they get on to, they get basically a temporary admission into the country.
[02:22:21.223 --> 02:22:27.865]  They're loaded onto buses and the, uh, basically they're shuttled all the way to the northern part of the country within a matter of hours.
[02:22:27.905 --> 02:22:31.706]  They just set them on buses, boom, and they sent them up to Costa Rica.
[02:22:31.726 --> 02:22:36.567]  And that's another thing I want people to understand is that all these countries down here, they might play nice, right?
[02:22:36.587 --> 02:22:37.827]  And they might act like they're our buddies.
[02:22:37.847 --> 02:22:38.427]  They're not our buddies.
[02:22:38.787 --> 02:22:41.489]  These people are sending these people all the way up to our border.
[02:22:41.529 --> 02:22:42.809]  It's like almost like a game of hot potato.
[02:22:42.849 --> 02:22:43.850]  It's like they're in Panama now.
[02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:44.991]  Okay, send them up to Costa Rica.
[02:22:45.351 --> 02:22:46.291]  Okay, they're in Costa Rica now.
[02:22:46.331 --> 02:22:47.232]  Send them into Nicaragua.
[02:22:47.732 --> 02:22:54.536]  And the definitive end state is the United States of America, because we're foolish enough to let these people in en masse.
[02:22:54.836 --> 02:22:58.979]  And so I just want people to understand basically a little bit more about the Darien Gap, and now we can move on.
[02:22:59.919 --> 02:23:06.942]  The bottom line is it's all State Department, U.N., Browns, all run, the same people that ran the U.N.
[02:23:06.962 --> 02:23:22.850]  refugee camps for the invasion of Europe, the same NGOs run this, and then the mayor goes, everything's fine, but suddenly he's like, oh God, it's terrible, terrorists are about to hit, so that tells me they're getting ready to let terrorists hit for domestic control, have more TSA groping as well, the border's wide open.
[02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:25.815]  Because I made the point we're going to blame the government for the terror attack.
[02:23:26.095 --> 02:23:28.059]  Now they're like, oh yeah, the border is broken.
[02:23:28.079 --> 02:23:30.463]  Why do you think they're suddenly signaling like that?
[02:23:31.643 --> 02:23:34.004]  Uh, well, you know, this can't go on forever.
[02:23:34.024 --> 02:23:37.225]  I mean, the situation's going to implode and probably to a certain extent they want to get out.
[02:23:37.245 --> 02:23:38.246]  Yes, they think we're done.
[02:23:38.326 --> 02:23:40.146]  Our goose is cooked enough to collapse the country.
[02:23:40.447 --> 02:23:41.647]  Now they want to act like they're the saviors.
[02:23:41.807 --> 02:23:42.367]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:42.387 --> 02:23:47.849]  And that's why also they're rolling out, you know, everybody knows or should know about the CBP One app, where basically they, it's the same thing.
[02:23:48.250 --> 02:23:49.090]  You know, it's the same issue.
[02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:49.710]  You still let it happen.
[02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:53.191]  Did you see the legislation leaked out of New York to have illegal aliens vote in the state elections?
[02:23:53.431 --> 02:23:53.952]  That's incredible.
[02:23:53.972 --> 02:23:55.432]  I know that they were doing that in New York City already.
[02:23:55.552 --> 02:23:56.373]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:23:56.393 --> 02:23:57.793]  They've already got cities doing it now.
[02:23:57.853 --> 02:23:58.433]  Boom, whole thing.
[02:23:58.573 --> 02:23:59.874]  Yeah, and, oh my God, yeah.
[02:24:00.234 --> 02:24:01.836]  And in Minnesota, they're making them police officers.
[02:24:01.896 --> 02:24:02.296]  It's insane.
[02:24:03.537 --> 02:24:04.057]  And Illinois?
[02:24:04.358 --> 02:24:05.138]  And Illinois as well.
[02:24:05.319 --> 02:24:07.100]  And New Mexico?
[02:24:07.861 --> 02:24:11.704]  And again, where's our territorialism?
[02:24:11.744 --> 02:24:15.988]  If I go to my neighbor's house and say, be nice to me, let me have sex with your wife, he'd beat my ass.
[02:24:16.348 --> 02:24:18.029]  But it's like, hey, let me come and get everything free.
[02:24:18.110 --> 02:24:20.291]  It's like, we're all caught up in our race, let's do it immediately.
[02:24:21.172 --> 02:24:22.053]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:22.093 --> 02:24:24.355]  Like, let's just ask a question to the audience.
[02:24:24.395 --> 02:24:28.559]  I mean, they keep saying that all women... Can I go to Mexico and show up in demand-free shit?
[02:24:28.579 --> 02:24:29.861]  They'd kick my ass, they should.
[02:24:30.341 --> 02:24:30.781]  Absolutely.
[02:24:31.302 --> 02:24:31.482]  Yeah.
[02:24:31.862 --> 02:24:32.463]  Rightfully so.
[02:24:34.325 --> 02:24:35.426]  Keep going.
[02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:36.547]  I mean, it's like...
[02:24:39.409 --> 02:24:41.251]  We could talk about the route, or we could talk about bigger picture things.
[02:24:41.291 --> 02:24:42.151]  It happened to either or.
[02:24:43.012 --> 02:24:43.893]  We should talk big picture.
[02:24:43.913 --> 02:24:45.374]  People know there's a full-on invasion.
[02:24:45.974 --> 02:24:46.555]  Big picture.
[02:24:47.195 --> 02:24:47.976]  You're a smart guy.
[02:24:48.696 --> 02:24:48.897]  Sure.
[02:24:49.577 --> 02:24:50.618]  How do we turn this around?
[02:24:52.079 --> 02:24:53.780]  We turn it around by having an educated populace.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:55.281]  We don't have an educated populace.
[02:24:55.421 --> 02:24:57.383]  That's the famous quote, right?
[02:24:57.743 --> 02:24:59.945]  We've got to have people like you that are willing to go show it.
[02:25:00.575 --> 02:25:01.356]  Yeah, I guess that's true.
[02:25:01.396 --> 02:25:02.737]  I mean, where's the international media?
[02:25:02.777 --> 02:25:04.218]  This is all incredible ratings.
[02:25:04.758 --> 02:25:05.579]  But they won't show it.
[02:25:05.619 --> 02:25:06.740]  It's all independent guys like you.
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:07.120]  Yeah.
[02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:09.882]  Like, you should have been, there should have been 20 reporters with you down there.
[02:25:10.142 --> 02:25:11.443]  You and your brother are all alone.
[02:25:11.723 --> 02:25:12.764]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:25:13.424 --> 02:25:16.767]  Well, that's, you know, identify value and... And you didn't even make it about yourself.
[02:25:16.807 --> 02:25:18.488]  You got kidnapped coming back to the Texas border.
[02:25:18.588 --> 02:25:24.232]  We got kidnapped coming back to the Texas border because our border is controlled by groups of narco-terrorists.
[02:25:24.272 --> 02:25:27.795]  I mean, that is... Well, give us big pictures when we go on a break in three minutes and come back with the kidnapping.
[02:25:27.955 --> 02:25:28.175]  Sure.
[02:25:28.675 --> 02:25:29.496]  The big picture is this.
[02:25:29.636 --> 02:25:36.199]  Everybody, I'm sure your audience is well aware, if you're not, everybody should probably go download the UN Agenda 2030 white paper.
[02:25:36.219 --> 02:25:44.242]  I know you talk about that all the time, but... Which the ADL says doesn't exist and called for my arrest for covering three years ago, but it's official UN policy.
[02:25:44.903 --> 02:25:44.242]  100%.
[02:25:44.983 --> 02:25:47.044]  I mean, they literally have a whole website dedicated to it.
[02:25:47.064 --> 02:25:48.824]  You can go download the white paper right now in 30 seconds.
[02:25:50.585 --> 02:26:00.073]  For example, you're in Panama, and there'll be big signs that show the colored pinwheel with the 17 sustainable development goals, and that's just openly displayed on Highway 1 in Panama.
[02:26:00.654 --> 02:26:06.459]  At the UN camps, they have the big swastika, the UN new rainbow swastikas up there.
[02:26:06.879 --> 02:26:07.760]  Guys, pull up the Agenda 2030 symbol.
[02:26:11.498 --> 02:26:15.760]  If you get a new Samsung phone, it comes with the Sustainable Development Goal app pre-installed with that pinwheel.
[02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:17.921]  And so the point is, that's what this is.
[02:26:17.961 --> 02:26:19.482]  This is all about Agenda 2030.
[02:26:19.562 --> 02:26:22.143]  This is all about collapsing sovereign nation-states.
[02:26:22.163 --> 02:26:23.464]  Guys, pull up UN.
[02:26:23.484 --> 02:26:24.264]  There it is.
[02:26:24.304 --> 02:26:24.525]  Boom.
[02:26:24.565 --> 02:26:25.185]  It's right there.
[02:26:25.565 --> 02:26:28.166]  Bill Gates, King Charles are all wearing that little symbol.
[02:26:28.366 --> 02:26:30.207]  That's the new Nazi arm, man.
[02:26:30.347 --> 02:26:33.229]  But notice, it's colorful and it's a rainbow, man.
[02:26:33.269 --> 02:26:37.571]  That's not sinister and coming to, you know, destroy and take all your wealth and your family, right?
[02:26:37.611 --> 02:26:39.692]  But it's actually saying we're taking every aspect over.
[02:26:39.952 --> 02:26:41.373]  It's a plan for world socialism.
[02:26:41.413 --> 02:26:41.933]  Everybody should read it.
[02:26:41.953 --> 02:26:44.195]  It talks about our new collective society.
[02:26:44.535 --> 02:26:48.217]  And it talks about how we're going to have education, for education provided for by whom?
[02:26:48.517 --> 02:26:49.758]  And we're going to eradicate poverty.
[02:26:49.778 --> 02:26:51.239]  I mean, this is Joseph Stalin stuff.
[02:26:51.659 --> 02:26:52.300]  It's the same thing.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:55.102]  I mean, honestly, socialists, they don't come up with anything new.
[02:26:55.142 --> 02:26:57.243]  It's the same- No, this is October Revolution crap.
[02:26:57.423 --> 02:26:58.744]  Well, it's the same stuff now.
[02:26:58.764 --> 02:27:04.266]  Now, okay, okay, listen, Anthony Rubin, Alex Jones, I get that, but how does this have to do with the mass migration of people?
[02:27:04.346 --> 02:27:06.406]  Everybody go download now another white paper.
[02:27:06.806 --> 02:27:20.692]  Migration and the 2030 Agenda by the IOM, the same group that printed out those condom pamphlets, and it literally calls these people agents of development, and it says the goal of quote-unquote migration, should be called invasion, and the 2030 Agenda
[02:27:22.032 --> 02:27:25.214]  Uh, is to facilitate not to stop migration.
[02:27:25.294 --> 02:27:27.495]  It's right there in your face, clear as day.
[02:27:27.535 --> 02:27:28.175]  They write about it.
[02:27:28.516 --> 02:27:29.816]  You always talk about how you read their blueprints.
[02:27:30.276 --> 02:27:46.045]  Go read these documents that we've just talked about, and you're gonna walk away understanding probably more than 99.9% of the people, certainly more than any congressman or senator, because again, these people don't... I'm convinced that they either are in on it, or they simply have no idea what's going on, most likely more of the latter, because I think you see these people talking, I mean, they're morons, a lot of these people.
[02:27:46.105 --> 02:27:47.645]  AOC has not a clue, right?
[02:27:47.665 --> 02:27:48.606]  She's just a sock puppet.
[02:27:48.846 --> 02:27:53.709]  So you, the audience, go start reading these documents and then understand it yourself and go and educate people.
[02:27:53.769 --> 02:27:55.070]  Maybe you'll wind up on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:55.410]  Who knows?
[02:27:55.890 --> 02:27:56.571]  But that's what's going on.
[02:27:56.591 --> 02:27:57.991]  I mean, that's big picture stuff, man.
[02:27:58.031 --> 02:28:09.578]  This is a globalist... I'm not trying to sound too much like Alex Jones, like I'm just repeating what you say, but this is a globalist agenda to take down the sovereign United States of America and build on top of it a world tyranny.
[02:28:09.598 --> 02:28:10.899]  That's what this is all about.
[02:28:10.939 --> 02:28:11.920]  There could be no other reason.
[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:15.722]  If anybody has seen this evidence and come to a different conclusion, I'd be interested to hear it.
[02:28:18.165 --> 02:28:20.579]  Yes sir, any other questions or I can just keep rambling on.
[02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:22.541]  I'm listening to everything you're saying.
[02:28:22.561 --> 02:28:23.901]  I'm sending out some transmissions here.
[02:28:24.021 --> 02:28:24.642]  Okay, okay.
[02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:25.942]  It's not that what you're saying is not important.
[02:28:26.102 --> 02:28:27.163]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:28:27.183 --> 02:28:33.506]  So we got 30 seconds left, but I just want the audience sitting at home to just grapple with these questions that I'm giving you.
[02:28:34.246 --> 02:28:36.267]  What's with all the demonization of white people?
[02:28:36.327 --> 02:28:40.609]  Why are they calling us all domestic terrorists and saying that we're white supremacists?
[02:28:40.629 --> 02:28:45.812]  Because they're going to collapse the economy and have us all race war, like Obama's new movie on Netflix.
[02:28:46.312 --> 02:28:47.873]  Literally says, don't trust the white people.
[02:28:47.893 --> 02:28:49.594]  When the power turns off, all kill each other.
[02:28:50.114 --> 02:28:51.395]  I mean, come on, people!
[02:28:51.815 --> 02:28:52.455]  Come on!
[02:28:53.976 --> 02:28:55.057]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.077 --> 02:29:00.260]  When I say this, I mean it from the very bottom of my heart.
[02:29:01.381 --> 02:29:05.503]  I want to say thank you to all the viewers and listeners for supporting the broadcast over the years.
[02:29:05.983 --> 02:29:12.467]  We, together, have changed the world at an incredible level, and I want to salute the crew as well, and all of our sponsors and supporters.
[02:29:12.907 --> 02:29:16.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the fight has really been joined with a globalist,
[02:29:17.948 --> 02:29:25.477]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[02:29:25.497 --> 02:29:27.159]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[02:29:27.579 --> 02:29:28.760]  Keep sharing the articles and videos.
[02:29:29.141 --> 02:29:32.044]  Keep praying for the broadcast and our reporters and the crew.

[02:30:05.937 --> 02:30:13.700]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:20.883]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[02:30:21.503 --> 02:30:31.433]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[02:30:31.954 --> 02:30:36.339]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[02:30:36.759 --> 02:30:40.463]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[02:30:40.683 --> 02:30:41.784]  Finally, after close to a year,
[02:31:01.332 --> 02:31:11.461]  In early November, where I'm cutting this ad, we finally got one of our flagship products back in stock, Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 organic.

[02:31:57.043 --> 02:31:58.404]  Your products have changed my life.
[02:31:58.764 --> 02:32:00.886]  Your brain force and all that make you better.
[02:32:00.926 --> 02:32:02.047]  They make you more focused.
[02:32:02.127 --> 02:32:03.188]  They make you feel better.
[02:32:03.208 --> 02:32:07.512]  A lot of lingering effects from when I was getting sober have now relieved me.
[02:32:07.672 --> 02:32:09.434]  My girlfriend goes to the gym and goes hard.
[02:32:09.454 --> 02:32:10.915]  She's done the same stuff.
[02:32:11.375 --> 02:32:12.897]  These products will change your life.
[02:32:13.377 --> 02:32:18.201]  They fund one of the greatest things out there right now for us as free Americans.
[02:32:18.362 --> 02:32:19.723]  Please do these people a favor.
[02:32:20.223 --> 02:32:26.928]  Go to their store, support them, do what you need to do, because if we lose InfoWars, we lose a lot more than what people are willing to believe.
[02:32:27.328 --> 02:32:44.359]  If you want to really get in shape for this thing about to come, get the HGH and get that testosterone boost, man, get in the gym, because I'm in the best shape of my life because of your product, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to not lose the greatest symbol against tyranny the world has ever seen, and that's our American flag.
[02:32:44.379 --> 02:32:46.241]  And with that, I appreciate loving InfoWars.
[02:32:46.261 --> 02:32:49.803]  I'll listen to you the day I die or you go off air, but I'm going to do my part to make sure you don't.
[02:32:59.607 --> 02:33:05.510]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:17.335 --> 02:33:17.857]  We're good.
[02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:12.970]  Right now we're in a train deck.
[02:34:13.710 --> 02:34:14.731]  It's 1 something in the morning.
[02:34:15.311 --> 02:34:19.334]  We're gonna be on this train for... I don't even know.
[02:34:19.354 --> 02:34:19.674]  20 hours.
[02:34:19.914 --> 02:34:20.435]  Something like that.
[02:34:21.475 --> 02:34:22.356]  I just came down with something.
[02:34:22.396 --> 02:34:23.136]  I'm super sick.
[02:34:23.536 --> 02:34:24.357]  And I just gotta pray.
[02:34:24.397 --> 02:34:25.178]  We just gotta pray.
[02:34:25.618 --> 02:34:26.578]  That it doesn't start raining out.
[02:34:27.619 --> 02:34:28.820]  And that we don't hit a major clump.
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:31.762]  That we don't slip off the side or something stupid.
[02:34:31.782 --> 02:34:33.983]  But... So far God's been on our side.
[02:34:34.003 --> 02:34:36.905]  So... Just... Stay tuned.
[02:34:38.007 --> 02:34:41.789]  So right now we are in Colombia at the Cabanas Rio Mayo Hotel.
[02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:50.635]  And this hotel that we stumbled upon by accident is a major hub, a major transit point, meeting place for Chinese foreign nationals that are on their way to the United States.
[02:34:51.175 --> 02:34:58.840]  And last night when we were here, we were eating at this hotel restaurant and we were the only foreigners that were not Chinese.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:01.822]  I mean literally the entire hotel is just Chinese foreigners.
[02:35:02.303 --> 02:35:04.247]  We spoke with the hotel staff here and they confirmed that.
[02:35:04.708 --> 02:35:08.756]  And while there are some women and children, it's mostly military-aged males.
[02:35:09.117 --> 02:35:10.780]  There's some right behind me right now, actually.
[02:35:13.373 --> 02:35:24.500]  We showed you in a previous video of ours a Chinese blueprint that's distributed amongst Chinese in WhatsApp groups, and this is actually one of the stops on the blueprint.
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:26.321]  It says to stop in Pasto.
[02:35:26.481 --> 02:35:27.202]  That's where we're at right now.
[02:35:27.222 --> 02:35:28.343]  We're on the outskirts of Pasto.
[02:35:28.703 --> 02:35:34.527]  The point is that the Chinese have very sophisticated quote-unquote migration networks all the way up to the U.S.
[02:35:34.567 --> 02:35:37.288]  border, and this hotel that we're at is proof of that.
[02:35:37.328 --> 02:35:39.750]  It's all Chinese, and for some reason, they all know to come here.
[02:35:39.770 --> 02:35:42.792]  It's because they are in direct communication with people that are further up the trail.
[02:35:44.056 --> 02:35:48.461]  But when you want to fly from Austin to Dallas, they put you in a body scanner.
[02:35:48.481 --> 02:35:50.483]  They may want to pinch your genitals.
[02:35:51.464 --> 02:35:53.046]  Or you want to fly from D.C.
[02:35:53.086 --> 02:35:56.870]  to Miami, they might want to put you in a body scanner or ask you questions in the ER.
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:35:58.511]  It's all slave training.
[02:35:59.212 --> 02:36:00.053]  It's all a joke.
[02:36:00.093 --> 02:36:03.417]  And now they say, is Llama Sister set to attack us any minute?
[02:36:04.506 --> 02:36:04.927]  We don't know.
[02:36:04.947 --> 02:36:06.810]  They're the ones that opened the border wide up.
[02:36:06.850 --> 02:36:10.296]  We have TheMuckraker.com investigative journalist Anthony Rubin here with us.
[02:36:10.316 --> 02:36:13.481]  I love how you didn't want to tell your own story.
[02:36:14.142 --> 02:36:16.927]  A few weeks ago, you got kidnapped on your way back up to Texas.
[02:36:17.725 --> 02:36:18.185]  That's correct.
[02:36:18.385 --> 02:36:28.650]  So, you know, after riding the so-called beast train and abetting with a massive caravan of these people, we were going to cross into the United States.
[02:36:29.010 --> 02:36:31.491]  And so, there's different places you can do that.
[02:36:31.611 --> 02:36:35.913]  I mean, you know, everybody can look at the document and you can see the different crossing points.
[02:36:36.113 --> 02:36:36.693]  There's tons of them.
[02:36:37.173 --> 02:36:43.436]  The area that we decided to cross, though, is right across the river from Boca Chica, Texas.
[02:36:44.156 --> 02:36:46.198]  And that's where Elon Musk's SpaceX is.
[02:36:46.278 --> 02:36:49.940]  And so there were a few reasons why we chose to attempt to cross there.
[02:36:51.141 --> 02:36:59.667]  One of the first reasons was that, hey, if we could actually successfully cross right there onto basically Elon Musk's SpaceX facility, that'll be pretty incredible.
[02:36:59.728 --> 02:37:03.050]  That'll make a pretty strong point that, you know, something's afoot here, right?
[02:37:03.370 --> 02:37:03.710]  At a minimum.
[02:37:04.631 --> 02:37:08.652]  And then number two, I figured, okay, well, it's right across me on my SpaceX, a critical spaceport.
[02:37:09.012 --> 02:37:14.334]  Surely, if there's any air, and, you know, it's right there on the Gulf of Mexico, on the Mexican side, it's a public Mexican beach that you're walking up.
[02:37:14.974 --> 02:37:22.337]  Figured, if there's any area that's safe and at least remotely secure, it'll probably be there, as opposed to, like, Eagle Pass or something, right?
[02:37:23.277 --> 02:37:30.224]  So we start walking up this beach.
[02:37:30.405 --> 02:37:31.626]  It's called Playa Baghdad.
[02:37:31.646 --> 02:37:41.176]  That's basically the last road that you can stop at before you have to just walk up coastline all the way up to the Rio Grande where that spits out to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:37:42.338 --> 02:37:51.669]  We are walking up this beach, we being my brother Joshua Rubin and I, we're walking up this beach and, uh, you know, so far everything's going well, right?
[02:37:51.789 --> 02:37:55.973]  We're, no problem, we're gonna make it to the United States, we're gonna cross over and finish this today.
[02:37:56.394 --> 02:37:56.954]  Go home and...
[02:37:57.615 --> 02:37:59.436]  Start the documentary with our incredible footage.
[02:37:59.496 --> 02:38:02.998]  So we thought, as we're walking up this beach, a truck stops us.
[02:38:03.318 --> 02:38:07.041]  First interesting thing, this truck had Texas plates, okay?
[02:38:07.421 --> 02:38:13.585]  Shows that these people are operating, I mean, it's kind of obvious already, but this is just proof, that these people are operating between nation states.
[02:38:13.605 --> 02:38:17.187]  They're operating between the United States of America and Mexico.
[02:38:17.947 --> 02:38:22.230]  And this truck stops us, and they basically say, hey listen, get in the truck right now, okay?
[02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:27.271]  We're gonna take you back to where you came from, we're gonna forget this ever happened, and you're gonna go on your merry way.
[02:38:27.551 --> 02:38:32.633]  And I shouldn't- they didn't say it like that, of course, this is in Spanish, and we were kind of broken Spanish going back and forth.
[02:38:33.373 --> 02:38:40.055]  And, um, basically I said, no, I'm not getting in your truck, I don't know who you are, and, you know, I have to get- I have to get to the- the river.
[02:38:40.135 --> 02:38:42.156]  I just told him I was a photographer trying to take photos, right?
[02:38:42.876 --> 02:38:56.381]  Long story short, they call up some supposed buddy of theirs, who's down there by the river, and they say, hey listen, I called my buddy, you now have to get in the truck with us, there's no choice, because if you walk down there by yourself, it's going to be trouble for you.
[02:38:56.881 --> 02:39:00.923]  So okay, fine, that's just the situation, we're not going anywhere, there's nowhere to run, we get in the truck, we start driving.
[02:39:00.943 --> 02:39:07.285]  Now at this point, I can see Elon Musk's SpaceX, I see the lights blinking, it's right in front of me, in the United States.
[02:39:07.345 --> 02:39:09.326]  I figure, oh my- See, the missile gantry is there.
[02:39:09.486 --> 02:39:10.266]  It's right there, man.
[02:39:10.686 --> 02:39:10.946]  You know?
[02:39:11.607 --> 02:39:13.528]  And, uh, it's almost like, it's almost like The Odyssey.
[02:39:13.688 --> 02:39:14.329]  Sounds surreal.
[02:39:14.489 --> 02:39:15.050]  It's straight up.
[02:39:15.130 --> 02:39:20.474]  It's like The Odyssey, like, where he could see his beloved Ithaca, and then, you know, he just gets taken back out to sea because of Poseidon.
[02:39:20.914 --> 02:39:22.015]  And that's literally what it was like.
[02:39:22.035 --> 02:39:28.900]  And so I could see it right there, and then this man who they called gets in the car, and immediately when I saw this guy, I was like, this is bad news.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:29.981]  I was like, I don't want to see this guy.
[02:39:30.021 --> 02:39:30.922]  He just didn't look friendly.
[02:39:31.242 --> 02:39:31.923]  You could, you could tell.
[02:39:32.183 --> 02:39:33.244]  Not friendly looking dude.
[02:39:33.544 --> 02:39:35.366]  They instantly whip the truck around, okay?
[02:39:35.566 --> 02:39:36.607]  Start driving back down south.
[02:39:37.347 --> 02:39:46.333]  This guy gets on the phone with this woman, starts rambling back and forth in Spanish, he puts me on the phone with her, now she's speaking perfect English, and she says, listen, like, what are you doing down here?
[02:39:46.373 --> 02:39:50.576]  I said, I'm just trying to photograph SpaceX from the Mexican side, that was my cover, right?
[02:39:51.036 --> 02:39:58.121]  And she said, well, listen, you're in, she literally told me, she's like, you're in cartel territory, you're supposed to pay $500 to go over there if you want to cross.
[02:39:58.461 --> 02:39:59.862]  I didn't say I wanted to cross, I just assumed that.
[02:40:00.582 --> 02:40:02.463]  And she said, you're now in the hands of the cartel.
[02:40:02.543 --> 02:40:05.444]  And she basically said, she's like, you're going to be handed off to armed men.
[02:40:05.844 --> 02:40:08.144]  I suggest you tell them the exact thing that you told me.
[02:40:08.764 --> 02:40:12.626]  And just to give you guys a SparkNotes version, basically, we're taken back to Playa Bagdad.
[02:40:13.006 --> 02:40:14.266]  We pull up next to this other truck.
[02:40:14.886 --> 02:40:17.247]  Then, this other truck is commanded by three armed men.
[02:40:17.267 --> 02:40:18.767]  They're all carrying assault rifles.
[02:40:19.668 --> 02:40:23.949]  And they all start screaming at us, they're like, you know, like, andele, andele, get into this other truck.
[02:40:25.046 --> 02:40:28.328]  By the way, we're going to put all this up front on your interview, but start over.
[02:40:55.226 --> 02:40:58.229]  They, uh, you know, they're searching us now for drugs or weapons.
[02:40:58.269 --> 02:40:58.929]  They don't know who we are.
[02:40:58.969 --> 02:41:01.631]  Maybe we're associated with some rival organization.
[02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:05.154]  Maybe we're actually, you know, some sort of intelligence agency that's spying on them.
[02:41:05.174 --> 02:41:06.636]  Because they see the drone, they're freaking out.
[02:41:07.036 --> 02:41:10.219]  They then put us on our knees, take hostage-type photos.
[02:41:10.259 --> 02:41:10.919]  They took my brother.
[02:41:10.939 --> 02:41:12.260]  They got him pinned up against the truck.
[02:41:12.901 --> 02:41:20.607]  And, um, you know, I'm thinking, like, this, this, if these people think that we're somehow intelligence guys or, you know, military, I mean, we could have a bolt put on our head straight up.
[02:41:21.027 --> 02:41:21.848]  These guys aren't messing around.
[02:41:21.868 --> 02:41:23.570]  They killed two Americans about a year ago.
[02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:25.011]  Right in that same area.
[02:41:25.851 --> 02:41:29.994]  And this whole time, another truck, four other armed men armed with the same stuff.
[02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:34.056]  AR-15 type variants or AK-47 variants.
[02:41:34.977 --> 02:41:36.938]  Pistols at their hip show up.
[02:41:37.018 --> 02:41:38.999]  Now we're surrounded by seven armed men at one point.
[02:41:39.079 --> 02:41:41.681]  One of these men points to my drone and holds a pistol to his head.
[02:41:41.801 --> 02:41:42.882]  I'm taking this as a death threat.
[02:41:43.602 --> 02:41:45.664]  Um, so anyway, I'm trying to negotiate with these guys.
[02:41:46.084 --> 02:41:47.785]  And you can tell these guys are unhinged, right?
[02:41:48.025 --> 02:41:50.467]  Where you'll be smiling at one point, right?
[02:41:50.527 --> 02:41:51.527]  And laughing at one point.
[02:41:51.808 --> 02:41:53.008]  I'm like, trying to make nice.
[02:41:53.028 --> 02:41:55.190]  So I'm talking about getting beers, showing them boxing moves and stuff.
[02:41:55.770 --> 02:41:57.652]  Uh, and, and then instantly, BAM!
[02:41:57.672 --> 02:41:58.712]  They just start screaming at you.
[02:41:58.732 --> 02:42:00.033]  You're like, whoa, these dudes are not friendly.
[02:42:00.113 --> 02:42:02.755]  I mean, these guys will go from laughing with you to putting a bullet in your head.
[02:42:02.995 --> 02:42:03.976]  It became crystal clear.
[02:42:04.576 --> 02:42:09.980]  And then, so anyway, long story short, they bind up our hands, throw blindfolds on me.
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:10.820]  They didn't have one from brother.
[02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:12.862]  They pulled the hood over his head, throw us in the back of a truck.
[02:42:13.662 --> 02:42:14.063]  We start.
[02:42:14.483 --> 02:42:15.003]  Skip the break.
[02:42:15.363 --> 02:42:18.085]  We start driving deeper into Mexico.
[02:42:19.346 --> 02:42:21.308]  They're saying, investigate your own.
[02:42:21.508 --> 02:42:22.989]  You're going to see El Jefe.
[02:42:23.289 --> 02:42:24.750]  I'm like, yeah, I don't want to see El Jefe.
[02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:25.651]  I don't know who this is.
[02:42:25.751 --> 02:42:31.855]  And, you know, I'm just I'm telling him the whole time, like, listen, and yeah, I'm telling him, listen, I'm like, you know, how much money do you guys want?
[02:42:32.076 --> 02:42:33.036]  You know, what do you want?
[02:42:33.056 --> 02:42:35.218]  We'll go to a town right now, pull it out and they won't have it.
[02:42:35.238 --> 02:42:37.720]  They're like, no, we're going to see the boss, El Jefe.
[02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:41.902]  And we're blindfolded the whole time, of course, I'm not like looking at him in the eye talking like this.
[02:42:42.462 --> 02:42:50.565]  And there's a man sitting next to my, it's myself, my brother, an armed man, you know, with an assault rifle sitting next to my brother here, and two armed men in the front.
[02:42:50.585 --> 02:42:51.385]  So we're not going anywhere.
[02:42:52.266 --> 02:42:55.487]  As we're driving throughout Mexico there, deeper into Mexico, they're making stops.
[02:42:55.827 --> 02:43:00.849]  People walking up to the truck, whispering about us saying, you know, intelligentsia or military.
[02:43:01.189 --> 02:43:02.890]  You know, they're smoking pot in the car.
[02:43:03.430 --> 02:43:04.390]  You're gonna write a fight?
[02:43:26.721 --> 02:43:27.922]  If we had to, what am I going to do?
[02:43:27.962 --> 02:43:30.745]  I'm not going to sit down like a sheep and have a bullet put in my head, that's for sure.
[02:43:30.785 --> 02:43:31.946]  Not that I could have done anything about it.
[02:43:31.967 --> 02:43:33.368]  If they wanted to whack me, they would have whacked me.
[02:43:33.388 --> 02:43:34.109]  But you're not fighting.
[02:43:34.549 --> 02:43:34.910]  That's right.
[02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:36.211]  I mean, there's no other choice.
[02:43:36.351 --> 02:43:41.356]  And so, I got my hand wraps to the point where I knew in an instant I could, bam, slip it out if I had to.
[02:43:41.777 --> 02:43:43.578]  You know, just trying to survive.
[02:43:43.598 --> 02:43:44.860]  You're just in survival mode at that point.
[02:43:45.721 --> 02:43:46.641]  You know, long story short,
[02:43:47.577 --> 02:43:53.364]  We roll up, doors open up, blindfold comes off, and we're in the middle of an abandoned field.
[02:43:53.384 --> 02:43:55.947]  And I mean smack dab in the middle of an abandoned field.
[02:43:55.987 --> 02:44:00.071]  I should have provided you guys with the Googled image of this, because Michael Yan the whole time was tracking me.
[02:44:00.111 --> 02:44:04.576]  We actually had an Apple AirTag on this that they didn't find, and so I actually can see where they took us.
[02:44:05.377 --> 02:44:08.781]  And, um, I'm like, damn, why are we in the middle of an abandoned field right now?
[02:44:08.801 --> 02:44:09.781]  This is where they execute you.
[02:44:10.062 --> 02:44:11.203]  Like, why else would we be here right now?
[02:44:11.223 --> 02:44:12.244]  There's no other purpose to be here.
[02:44:12.624 --> 02:44:13.445]  But that's not what happened.
[02:44:13.665 --> 02:44:16.768]  They lined up all of our electronic gear, started screaming at us.
[02:44:16.808 --> 02:44:20.612]  They didn't believe that they had gotten all of our memory cards, which actually, they didn't.
[02:44:20.672 --> 02:44:21.713]  They didn't find my GoPro.
[02:44:21.733 --> 02:44:23.514]  That was in kind of a secret compartment, which they didn't get.
[02:44:23.555 --> 02:44:27.598]  So, I actually maintained my most important footage of getting smuggled into Mexico by the Sinaloa Cartel.
[02:44:27.638 --> 02:44:29.060]  So, because I was never going to do that again.
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:29.981]  So, they didn't get that.
[02:44:30.621 --> 02:44:31.121]  Uh, thank God.
[02:44:31.742 --> 02:44:37.104]  Um, and so, they line up all of our electronic gear, and they take out a crowbar, and they smash it to bits and pieces.
[02:44:37.124 --> 02:44:38.945]  I mean, they straight-up thought that we were spying on them.
[02:44:39.546 --> 02:44:43.668]  And then they load us into another car, and they drive us to the port, uh, the, you know, the port of entry, and they let us go.
[02:44:43.928 --> 02:44:45.609]  Let me, I just wanna make a couple points off of this, though.
[02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:47.821]  Because again, it's a cool story.
[02:44:47.921 --> 02:44:53.504]  It's like, you know, I'll tell it on a date or I'll tell it at the Thanksgiving table in 10 years or whatever, right?
[02:44:53.544 --> 02:44:53.884]  It's cool.
[02:44:54.104 --> 02:44:56.666]  Tell us about the time you got kidnapped, but there's so much more to this.
[02:44:56.746 --> 02:45:01.548]  Number one, if I had been had, you know, marijuana on me, not, I don't, I don't smoke marijuana.
[02:45:01.608 --> 02:45:03.269]  I don't recommend that anyone does.
[02:45:03.449 --> 02:45:04.570]  Yeah, that's my point, right?
[02:45:04.590 --> 02:45:05.230]  That's their business.
[02:45:05.270 --> 02:45:06.051]  That's their business.
[02:45:06.211 --> 02:45:07.592]  I would have had a bullet put in my head likely.
[02:45:08.496 --> 02:45:10.217]  And my other point is this.
[02:45:12.117 --> 02:45:13.477]  This is not about me getting kidnapped.
[02:45:13.617 --> 02:45:19.399]  The point of this is right across from Elon Musk's SpaceX, you got these guys that are running drugs back and forth.
[02:45:19.439 --> 02:45:31.482]  Actually, I know definitively that's why they picked us up because what happened is after they ended up, you know, smashing all our stuff, we went back home and we said, damn, well, you know, we didn't do all this to not make a full documentary.
[02:45:31.522 --> 02:45:37.604]  So we either need to go back into Mexico to get all of our footage back to retake it, or, you know, we got to try to buy our footage back from the cartel.
[02:45:38.144 --> 02:45:42.509]  I actually got in touch with Gulf cartel members through Facebook.
[02:45:42.529 --> 02:45:44.251]  You can find these people openly on Facebook groups.
[02:45:44.271 --> 02:45:45.612]  I mean, they're totally open.
[02:45:45.932 --> 02:45:51.999]  They're public about what they do, posing in their military gear and with their assault rifles, and it says in their bio.
[02:45:52.199 --> 02:45:53.900]  But Mexico doesn't have a Second Amendment.
[02:45:54.201 --> 02:45:56.844]  The citizens can't own guns, but if you're in a crime gang, you get them.
[02:45:57.004 --> 02:45:57.404]  That's right.
[02:45:58.625 --> 02:46:23.258]  And so you could find these people and so I did and I actually found a man who was able to then I paid him some money and I said I want my memory cards back I'm gonna pay you some money see if you could go find my memory cards and if you can I'll pay you some more and this guy actually went and I know definitively that he found the guys that took me because he then reports back to me he goes oh are you the Americans that got picked up by these guys and they smashed your camera gear and then dropped you off at the bridge the point of entry and I go yeah that was me
[02:46:23.778 --> 02:46:26.239]  And he goes, oh yeah, I talked to the guys that took you.
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:29.541]  They were actually running drugs back and forth and they thought you were spying on them.
[02:46:29.701 --> 02:46:30.362]  That's what they were doing.
[02:46:30.462 --> 02:46:31.282]  And so I was told this.
[02:46:31.622 --> 02:46:36.205]  And I know that he wasn't BSing me because he literally, you know... He knew the whole story.
[02:46:36.265 --> 02:46:36.925]  Yeah, he knew the whole story.
[02:46:38.633 --> 02:46:39.334]  That's what's going on.
[02:46:39.374 --> 02:46:40.335]  So the point is this.
[02:46:40.355 --> 02:46:42.256]  It's not about, oh, Anthony Rubin got kidnapped.
[02:46:42.296 --> 02:46:42.817]  It's so cool.
[02:46:42.837 --> 02:46:43.517]  It's actually not cool.
[02:46:43.537 --> 02:46:46.320]  It's very emasculating to have another group of men take you against your will.
[02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:47.200]  I don't recommend it.
[02:46:48.121 --> 02:46:52.745]  The point is this, that right across... The UN is sending men, women, and children into this.
[02:46:52.925 --> 02:46:59.671]  It's sending them into this, and not only that, right across from this critical spaceport, where you would imagine it would be... Overhead shot, guys.
[02:46:59.931 --> 02:47:01.092]  Zoom in on the base of the spaceport.
[02:47:01.132 --> 02:47:01.352]  Go ahead.
[02:47:01.672 --> 02:47:04.755]  If there was ever an area that you would imagine... Show on the screen, right by the ocean.
[02:47:04.895 --> 02:47:05.375]  Yeah, right here.
[02:47:05.435 --> 02:47:07.816]  This is where we got taken, right there in the Gulf of Mexico, right there on the beach.
[02:47:07.836 --> 02:47:12.598]  If there was ever an area that you would imagine would be controlled and secure, it would probably be right here, along the whole border.
[02:47:12.618 --> 02:47:13.738]  I mean, it would probably be right here.
[02:47:14.039 --> 02:47:15.799]  But the point is, it's not controlled and secure.
[02:47:15.819 --> 02:47:19.501]  No, it's only secure when you're flying from Albuquerque to Phoenix.
[02:47:19.521 --> 02:47:21.141]  Then they're going to squeeze your testicles.
[02:47:21.281 --> 02:47:21.661]  Correct.
[02:47:22.262 --> 02:47:22.722]  Correct.
[02:47:23.962 --> 02:47:25.643]  Your kid's testicles are going to get checked.
[02:47:25.683 --> 02:47:26.763]  If they can cut them off, they will.
[02:47:27.284 --> 02:47:27.684]  That's right.
[02:47:28.264 --> 02:47:30.605]  And so, my point is, what?
[02:47:31.005 --> 02:47:38.747]  If this area isn't secure and it's controlled by these narco-terrorists, that's what they are, call it as it is, what the hell is going on up here?
[02:47:38.968 --> 02:47:40.868]  They could be moving anything across the board.
[02:47:40.888 --> 02:47:43.049]  I mean, they could literally be moving nuclear weapons across that border.
[02:47:43.069 --> 02:47:44.009]  That's not an exaggeration.
[02:47:44.369 --> 02:47:47.570]  They could be moving, well, they actually are moving, like caravans.
[02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:48.851]  No, our country's totally screwed.
[02:47:48.911 --> 02:47:50.131]  And we don't say that to be negative.
[02:47:50.591 --> 02:47:53.412]  I see headlines, Jones says America's screwed, he's anti-America.
[02:47:53.712 --> 02:47:56.233]  No, the people that let this happen are anti-American.
[02:47:56.613 --> 02:47:59.154]  I'm not bad pointing out what the crazy government did.
[02:47:59.474 --> 02:47:59.694]  Yeah.
[02:47:59.874 --> 02:48:10.442]  The resources for January 6th, the harassment I've been through, at least four grand juries trying to indict me, huge federal task forces, all the stuff to Trump, and then we're not doing any of this.
[02:48:10.542 --> 02:48:11.923]  We're like regular people.
[02:48:12.263 --> 02:48:13.604]  Trump's trying to build golf courses.
[02:48:13.804 --> 02:48:14.004]  Yeah.
[02:48:14.164 --> 02:48:15.165]  I mean, come on, man.
[02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:15.565]  Yeah, man.
[02:48:15.866 --> 02:48:16.486]  Come on.
[02:48:17.006 --> 02:48:21.169]  The guy trying to build golf courses and get American jobs back, he's got to be dealt with.
[02:48:21.209 --> 02:48:22.730]  But everybody running this, they're great.
[02:48:22.971 --> 02:48:23.191]  Yeah.
[02:48:23.291 --> 02:48:24.472]  Now, we have a criminal group.
[02:48:24.972 --> 02:48:25.152]  Yeah.
[02:48:25.172 --> 02:48:25.553]  In charge.
[02:48:25.913 --> 02:48:26.154]  Yeah.
[02:48:26.414 --> 02:48:32.903]  I mean, I'd almost like to interview you and talk about how you're planning to handle this when SHTF, because it's going to be bad.
[02:48:32.943 --> 02:48:33.524]  I don't have a plan.
[02:48:33.564 --> 02:48:34.726]  I'm just fighting as hard as I can.
[02:48:34.746 --> 02:48:38.311]  Because if I start thinking about that, I have no backup plan.
[02:48:38.531 --> 02:48:38.952]  I'm just here.
[02:48:39.373 --> 02:48:39.773]  Respect.
[02:48:40.054 --> 02:48:40.835]  Going down with the ship, man.
[02:48:41.075 --> 02:48:41.755]  I feel the same way.
[02:48:41.775 --> 02:48:42.775]  I'm not fleeing anywhere, man.
[02:48:42.815 --> 02:48:44.396]  This is the beloved republic.
[02:48:44.436 --> 02:48:45.416]  This is the United States of America.
[02:48:45.436 --> 02:48:46.316]  I'm not fleeing anywhere.
[02:48:46.636 --> 02:48:46.897]  At all.
[02:48:47.217 --> 02:48:49.397]  No other nation-state will have me in it.
[02:48:49.497 --> 02:48:49.717]  At all.
[02:48:49.757 --> 02:48:52.718]  Well, they want us all to kill each other, black and white, and all that when this goes down.
[02:48:53.218 --> 02:48:55.639]  And I'm not calling for killing anybody, but let's not kill each other.
[02:48:56.119 --> 02:48:57.959]  And let's remember, the globalists set all this up.
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:48:59.000]  They're the ones that did this.
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:48:59.540]  Yeah.
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:00.680]  Yeah.
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:01.981]  I also want to say this, though.
[02:49:02.421 --> 02:49:08.644]  I mean, there is, I believe, and I hope this isn't misplaced optimism, I truly believe that there is a lot to be optimistic about.
[02:49:08.684 --> 02:49:11.846]  I truly believe, for example, you look at geographically the United States of America.
[02:49:12.146 --> 02:49:16.288]  I think it's the most finely geographically situated country on the face of the earth.
[02:49:16.588 --> 02:49:22.431]  You look at our population, I mean, I think that we still have the biggest, you know, like, per capita libertarian freedom.
[02:49:22.611 --> 02:49:24.172]  Now, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:49:24.292 --> 02:49:27.294]  The best house to bed neighborhood, so I'd rather be there than any of these other...
[02:49:46.184 --> 02:49:46.364]  Right.
[02:49:46.644 --> 02:49:47.104]  Absolutely.
[02:49:47.124 --> 02:49:50.886]  I mean, what's going to happen when, for example, when the dollar collapses?
[02:49:50.926 --> 02:49:53.667]  That's like something that just gets... I'm surprised we've lasted this long.
[02:49:53.687 --> 02:49:56.049]  And they're going to do a power outage or something to blame it on that.
[02:49:56.089 --> 02:49:57.529]  But yeah, they're coming to the end of the dollar.
[02:49:57.769 --> 02:49:59.590]  They've got all their new global currencies ready.
[02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:01.251]  Their ESG is ready.
[02:50:01.611 --> 02:50:02.832]  Central bank digital currencies.
[02:50:02.872 --> 02:50:03.192]  We're here.
[02:50:04.293 --> 02:50:04.913]  Let's focus on that.
[02:50:04.933 --> 02:50:07.535]  I mean, what's going to happen when hyperinflation hits or power outages?
[02:50:07.555 --> 02:50:12.580]  But I mean, hyperinflation, that's a... Well, it's already... I'm saying they're going to use that as the reset excuse.
[02:50:13.561 --> 02:50:16.423]  Oh, you know, we don't go to jail like Bernie Madoff or Sam Binkman Freed.
[02:50:17.024 --> 02:50:19.406]  Oh, it was the right-wingers hacked the power grid.
[02:50:19.446 --> 02:50:20.787]  That's why your dollar went to zero.
[02:50:20.887 --> 02:50:21.087]  Right.
[02:50:21.368 --> 02:50:23.710]  They're pre-programming that heavily now.
[02:50:23.950 --> 02:50:24.150]  Right.
[02:50:24.390 --> 02:50:26.112]  Obama just put on a new TV show about that.
[02:50:26.632 --> 02:50:27.293]  Yeah.
[02:50:27.313 --> 02:50:28.634]  Yeah, you guys had it before I came on.
[02:50:28.794 --> 02:50:28.994]  Yeah.
[02:50:29.295 --> 02:50:30.636]  Don't trust the white people when this goes down.
[02:50:31.527 --> 02:50:36.093]  How about we don't trust the bankers when this goes down?
[02:50:47.432 --> 02:50:51.816]  People that were otherwise liberty-oriented will run and clamor for a strongman.
[02:50:51.876 --> 02:50:54.058]  I think back to the BLM riots, right?
[02:50:54.098 --> 02:50:54.859]  Think about what happened then.
[02:50:55.139 --> 02:51:04.408]  It was either you were a total communist socialist raising your BLM fist, or you were, you know, Blue Lives Matter, the police could do no wrong.
[02:51:04.428 --> 02:51:05.709]  There was no distinction there.
[02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:08.211]  Globalists basically control both groups.
[02:51:08.612 --> 02:51:08.752]  Exactly.
[02:51:08.772 --> 02:51:09.452]  At the end of the day.
[02:51:09.712 --> 02:51:14.616]  So tell me about, you don't talk about yourself, but you and your brother, you said you watch my show, got spurred on some other things.
[02:51:15.357 --> 02:51:21.882]  Your family, I mean, you're doing a great job, you're a really impressive guy, but who are you, what's your family background that got you to even care?
[02:51:21.902 --> 02:51:23.243]  You need to get other people to care.
[02:51:23.523 --> 02:51:24.364]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:51:24.424 --> 02:51:27.166]  We need a thousand Anthony Rubens down there putting skin in the game.
[02:51:27.406 --> 02:51:29.369]  Well, I'm honored for you to say that, man.
[02:51:29.850 --> 02:51:31.632]  Yeah, I'll give people a little bit about my background.
[02:51:31.693 --> 02:51:35.318]  I mean, I'm from Long Island, New York, originally.
[02:51:35.678 --> 02:51:37.281]  I don't know that I would ever go back there again.
[02:51:39.664 --> 02:51:41.247]  Not there anymore, but that's where I grew up.
[02:51:43.706 --> 02:51:46.068]  Came up in a middle class family.
[02:51:46.348 --> 02:51:48.270]  My parents split when I was a teenager.
[02:51:48.810 --> 02:51:50.011]  Lower middle class at that point.
[02:51:50.051 --> 02:51:50.872]  Took a hit.
[02:51:50.932 --> 02:51:54.154]  I actually got to experience more of the real world at that point, which I'm grateful for.
[02:51:54.835 --> 02:51:58.798]  And I guess as it pertains to this though, I always kind of had my eye
[02:51:59.598 --> 02:52:00.079]  We're holding it back.
[02:52:18.234 --> 02:52:19.734]  Everybody's like, oh, where's the collapse?
[02:52:20.615 --> 02:52:21.675]  You can see it's here.
[02:52:21.715 --> 02:52:22.935]  We're barely holding it back.
[02:52:23.316 --> 02:52:25.196]  So people don't be like, oh, let's see a collapse.
[02:52:25.216 --> 02:52:25.996]  You're about to get one.
[02:52:26.296 --> 02:52:27.497]  And it's going to be worse.
[02:52:27.577 --> 02:52:29.457]  I mean, it would be better had it happened 10 years ago.
[02:52:29.497 --> 02:52:31.218]  Like Ron Paul said, it would have been way better back then.
[02:52:31.238 --> 02:52:31.898]  It would have been way better.
[02:52:31.918 --> 02:52:33.159]  Because it was all right before then.
[02:52:33.179 --> 02:52:34.459]  Now they've gotten this bubble.
[02:52:34.479 --> 02:52:37.300]  It's like blowing a balloon up so big, you know it's going to pop.
[02:52:37.360 --> 02:52:40.141]  And you're like, oh, the weight's going to get bigger.
[02:52:40.161 --> 02:52:40.361]  Right.
[02:52:41.201 --> 02:52:42.122]  That's exactly right.
[02:52:42.162 --> 02:52:47.648]  And so honestly, I shouldn't have said thank God it hasn't popped yet, because if it had popped, we could have actually dealt with it.
[02:52:47.688 --> 02:52:50.310]  But when it pops, actually, they're not going to deal with it the right way.
[02:52:50.330 --> 02:52:52.272]  We're not going to revert to small government.
[02:52:52.292 --> 02:52:56.196]  No, they're saying on Obama-produced TV shows, blacks murder whites.
[02:52:57.197 --> 02:52:59.259]  Like, when the power goes off, murder the white people.
[02:53:01.454 --> 02:53:01.694]  Yeah.
[02:53:02.015 --> 02:53:05.138]  Plus, white people got most of the guns.
[02:53:05.438 --> 02:53:06.479]  It's not good for black people.
[02:53:06.759 --> 02:53:08.061]  But I'm not in a war with black people.
[02:53:08.101 --> 02:53:09.622]  It's a setup, folks.
[02:53:10.083 --> 02:53:10.483]  That's right.
[02:53:10.863 --> 02:53:17.930]  To bring it back, that was me, a teenager, preparing for this.
[02:53:18.210 --> 02:53:21.634]  You could see, I should have given you guys this if we were going to go into my personal history.
[02:53:21.654 --> 02:53:22.415]  There's videos of me like,
[02:53:23.626 --> 02:53:27.048]  17 years old, 16, 17 years old, where I'm literally like on video talking to my friends.
[02:53:27.068 --> 02:53:28.269]  They're like, hey, you know what?
[02:53:28.289 --> 02:53:29.290]  Talk to yourself in the future.
[02:53:29.310 --> 02:53:31.951]  I'm like, and the Federal Reserve if you ever have the chance to.
[02:53:31.991 --> 02:53:33.552]  Like, prepare for the dollar collapse.
[02:53:33.632 --> 02:53:35.133]  I've been thinking about this stuff for a while.
[02:53:35.373 --> 02:53:36.594]  So this is just kind of an extrapolation.
[02:53:36.614 --> 02:53:37.194]  How old are you now?
[02:53:37.835 --> 02:53:37.935]  I'm 26.
[02:53:38.695 --> 02:53:39.336]  Wow, great job.
[02:53:39.356 --> 02:53:39.977]  26 years old.
[02:53:40.117 --> 02:53:41.999]  And that's the thing, they arrest development.
[02:53:42.359 --> 02:53:44.222]  Thomas Jefferson was out of college when he was 17.
[02:53:44.402 --> 02:53:47.545]  He was writing the Declaration of Independence, you know, a decade later.
[02:53:48.467 --> 02:53:49.428]  They arrest development.
[02:53:49.448 --> 02:53:50.729]  They call people kids that are 20.
[02:53:51.130 --> 02:53:52.671]  I was super successful at 26 as well.
[02:53:53.272 --> 02:53:55.495]  Men are supposed to get out and do it early, man.
[02:53:56.994 --> 02:53:59.616]  Yeah, I mean how old was Thomas Jefferson when he wrote the Declaration?
[02:53:59.636 --> 02:54:00.096]  Thirty-three.
[02:54:00.136 --> 02:54:00.617]  Thirty-three.
[02:54:00.797 --> 02:54:01.197]  There you go.
[02:54:01.617 --> 02:54:02.398]  Yeah, thirty-three.
[02:54:02.438 --> 02:54:05.080]  We actually have like thirty-three year old man children.
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:06.881]  That's like the majority of thirty-three year olds these days.
[02:54:06.921 --> 02:54:07.782]  Straight up man children.
[02:54:07.802 --> 02:54:08.682]  I don't even hate them.
[02:54:08.722 --> 02:54:08.882]  Well, no.
[02:54:08.982 --> 02:54:17.528]  Rich families that didn't want their sons to be wimps, when they were nine, would say, you're going on a three year boat ride around the world, and half the time they didn't come back.
[02:54:17.548 --> 02:54:18.929]  But families said, we don't want pussies.
[02:54:19.310 --> 02:54:19.830]  You're going.
[02:54:20.090 --> 02:54:20.310]  Yeah.
[02:54:20.350 --> 02:54:21.771]  They'd throw their son on a ship.
[02:54:22.212 --> 02:54:22.412]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.223 --> 02:54:26.206]  Now all these people are getting degrees in gender education and gender identity.
[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:44.022]  Honestly, this is not like a surprise that I'm doing all this.
[02:54:44.683 --> 02:54:46.785]  It's really cool to be on here, and you know, it's mind-blowing.
[02:54:46.865 --> 02:54:48.026]  It's like, wow, I'm on here with Alex Jones.
[02:54:48.046 --> 02:54:53.511]  But I always knew I was going to do something in the political realm because, you know, I could see from an early age where this country was headed.
[02:54:53.831 --> 02:55:01.618]  And so after, you know, getting out of college, working a bit, and you know, just saving up all my money, I put myself in a position where I can now go out with a camera and do this.
[02:55:01.658 --> 02:55:04.120]  And so this is basically, this is my current
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:09.464]  Not my only, not my final, but my current contribution to our American Republic.
[02:55:09.924 --> 02:55:12.827]  And, listen, it's liberty or death as far as I'm concerned.
[02:55:12.847 --> 02:55:15.569]  As far as my contribution, where I stand, it's liberty or death.
[02:55:15.649 --> 02:55:16.670]  I'm not fleeing anywhere.
[02:55:16.990 --> 02:55:18.712]  This is my beloved United States of America.
[02:55:19.352 --> 02:55:21.854]  And, yeah, I believe that we're going to win.
[02:55:21.894 --> 02:55:29.640]  We have to believe we're going to win, actually, because if we don't, it's almost, this is what I was talking about before with Harrison, it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy if you become a pessimist.
[02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:33.804]  It's like, oh, there's nothing we can do, and then... Hold on, there's five more minutes before the next guest house takes over.
[02:55:34.324 --> 02:55:35.705]  I need to plug, or we weren't going to be here.
[02:55:35.986 --> 02:55:39.649]  Folks, it takes money to fight the D-State, the CIA, the Justice Department.
[02:55:40.329 --> 02:55:41.410]  I'll just say that happily.
[02:55:41.450 --> 02:55:42.371]  That's who we're up against.
[02:55:42.772 --> 02:55:43.672]  You've kept us on air.
[02:55:43.712 --> 02:55:44.673]  We have a lot of new viewers.
[02:55:44.994 --> 02:55:57.945]  We have great supplements, great films, great books, the best horrible foods, biggest, best company, lowest prices, best ice rated, water filters, low prices, the best supplements, TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, X2, the missing link for your whole immune system and body.
[02:55:58.546 --> 02:56:00.607]  These are really powerful products.
[02:56:01.428 --> 02:56:08.933]  You can get it at InfowarsStore.com and that's what keeps this crew, the satellite uplinks, the legal operations, holding back the enemy.
[02:56:09.294 --> 02:56:18.000]  And I knew, because God told me, I said this years ago, we're going to hold on and as the enemy launches their whole plan, we'll have so much credibility that we'll be unstoppable.
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:21.462]  We have now reached that point.
[02:56:21.843 --> 02:56:23.243]  And that wasn't me, that was the Holy Spirit.
[02:56:23.604 --> 02:56:26.126]  But we need still the seed funds to operate.
[02:56:26.166 --> 02:56:29.408]  Plus, we've got products you need that will change your life.
[02:56:29.848 --> 02:56:30.809]  X2 will change your life.
[02:56:32.031 --> 02:56:32.672]  It's game-changing.
[02:56:47.864 --> 02:56:49.224]  Thank you for having me.
[02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:10.470]  I don't think so.
[02:57:31.815 --> 02:57:36.340]  When I say this, I mean it from the very bottom of my heart.
[02:57:51.980 --> 02:57:56.122]  I want to say thank you to all the viewers and listeners for supporting the broadcast over the years.
[02:57:56.602 --> 02:57:59.904]  We together have changed the world at an incredible level.
[02:57:59.924 --> 02:58:03.085]  And I want to salute the crew as well and all of our sponsors and supporters.
[02:58:03.525 --> 02:58:07.527]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the fight has really been joined with a globalist.
[02:58:08.562 --> 02:58:16.090]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[02:58:16.110 --> 02:58:17.771]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[02:58:18.212 --> 02:58:19.373]  Keep sharing your articles and videos.
[02:58:19.773 --> 02:58:22.656]  Keep praying for the broadcast and our reporters and the crew.
[02:58:23.037 --> 02:58:30.204]  And shop at infowarestore.com, where for Christmas, we have the biggest sales of the year, double Patreon points, worldwide free shipping,
[02:58:30.544 --> 02:58:35.448]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[02:58:55.814 --> 02:59:08.840]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:18.045]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[02:59:19.628 --> 02:59:40.066]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[02:59:40.626 --> 02:59:44.810]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.

[02:59:49.321 --> 02:59:55.262]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!

[03:00:06.544 --> 03:00:09.645]  We've got a great guest host coming up here in a few minutes at Owen Troyer in one hour.
[03:00:09.665 --> 03:00:11.866]  TheWarRoomInfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:00:12.246 --> 03:00:14.106]  AnthonyReubenMuckraker.com.
[03:00:14.506 --> 03:00:18.327]  Anthony Reuben at X at Real Muckraker and YouTube Real Muckraker.
[03:00:18.347 --> 03:00:21.428]  We've got four and a half minutes until we end this interview.
[03:00:21.488 --> 03:00:22.188]  Really impressed.
[03:00:22.828 --> 03:00:23.589]  You wanted to give us some hope.
[03:00:23.609 --> 03:00:24.629]  You've got some other points to make.
[03:00:25.339 --> 03:00:27.801]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I don't want it to be misplaced optimism.
[03:00:27.841 --> 03:00:28.521]  I'm a realist.
[03:00:28.701 --> 03:00:34.304]  But at the end of the day, if we just roll on our backs, these people are just going to trample over us and we're going to die.
[03:00:34.865 --> 03:00:35.805]  So I don't want that to happen.
[03:00:35.985 --> 03:00:39.247]  So I just want to hopefully give the audience some words of encouragement.
[03:00:40.388 --> 03:00:42.329]  You know, first, let me show you what's coming.
[03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:46.812]  I mean, this is something that if you guys want to put the doc cam on this, this is something that I found in Yuma, Arizona.
[03:00:46.832 --> 03:00:49.914]  This is a vaccine World Health Organization passport.
[03:00:50.194 --> 03:00:53.216]  So people who don't think this is coming, this is what's coming our way if we don't fight back.
[03:00:53.616 --> 03:00:54.997]  Can we overshadow that, guys?
[03:00:55.317 --> 03:00:56.777]  I've actually never seen one of these things before.
[03:00:57.397 --> 03:00:59.198]  I found this in Yuma, Arizona.
[03:00:59.358 --> 03:01:00.038]  Show the cover.
[03:01:00.058 --> 03:01:00.378]  Zoom in.
[03:01:00.418 --> 03:01:00.759]  Lay it down.
[03:01:00.779 --> 03:01:01.639]  We're going to zoom in.
[03:01:01.659 --> 03:01:02.359]  Check that out right there.
[03:01:03.199 --> 03:01:04.660]  Yeah, the UN right there.
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:05.940]  So this is what's coming, okay?
[03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:07.481]  If we don't do anything about this, okay?
[03:01:07.661 --> 03:01:08.821]  The invasion's going to continue.
[03:01:09.662 --> 03:01:10.882]  We already talked about blackouts.
[03:01:11.242 --> 03:01:13.263]  It's like too depressing to keep rehashing it.
[03:01:13.283 --> 03:01:14.723]  So anyway, what I want to say is this.
[03:01:15.244 --> 03:01:16.164]  For anybody that might be at home,
[03:01:17.199 --> 03:01:18.739]  You know, thinking, OK, well, what can I do?
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:20.960]  It seems too daunting, right?
[03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:24.901]  I don't want to go into Mexico and get smuggled over by the Sinaloa cartel.
[03:01:25.261 --> 03:01:34.143]  I don't want to go speak out because somebody might come after me on Twitter and I might get, you know, demonized or people might misrepresent what I say and drag my name through the mud or whatever.
[03:01:34.163 --> 03:01:35.904]  Yeah, you know, I can keep going on.
[03:01:36.704 --> 03:01:39.766]  What I want to say is this, it's all about perspective.
[03:01:39.986 --> 03:01:41.326]  Perspective is everything.
[03:01:41.467 --> 03:01:46.949]  If I, you know, there could be an objective situation in front of myself and Alex Jones right next to me, right?
[03:01:46.989 --> 03:01:48.570]  The same objective situation.
[03:01:48.990 --> 03:01:55.594]  And depending on what our subjective perception is of that situation that's right in front of us, we may have two completely different outcomes.
[03:01:55.914 --> 03:01:58.016]  Maybe a really positive outcome and a really negative outcome.
[03:01:58.036 --> 03:01:59.196]  And so why do I say this?
[03:01:59.697 --> 03:02:05.601]  It's because everybody at home, everybody who watches needs to have the perspective of, for example, the Founding Fathers.
[03:02:05.661 --> 03:02:06.502]  Put yourself in those shoes.
[03:02:06.522 --> 03:02:07.482]  Think about what they did.
[03:02:07.502 --> 03:02:15.348]  I mean, literally put their signatures on a document where if they lost, it was getting strung up, right, and getting hung in the gallows somewhere.
[03:02:15.368 --> 03:02:16.328]  I mean, they were all going to die.
[03:02:16.348 --> 03:02:18.330]  Or getting put for four years on a slave ship.
[03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:20.172]  Yeah, something like that, right?
[03:02:21.113 --> 03:02:23.435]  I mean, just think about the great men throughout history, right?
[03:02:23.475 --> 03:02:25.517]  Like the great explorers, the Lewis and Clarks.
[03:02:25.978 --> 03:02:36.208]  If you think about your life and put it into perspective against the backdrop of these great men, and it doesn't have to be those men I just listed, any great person, whoever you could derive inspiration from,
[03:02:36.849 --> 03:02:37.049]  Right.
[03:02:37.490 --> 03:02:39.834]  All great people share similar attributes.
[03:02:40.515 --> 03:02:44.240]  And if you could basically operate based off of that perspective.
[03:02:44.341 --> 03:02:49.248]  Okay, let me let me see where I'm at in my life and oriented based off of have I achieved that level of greatness.
[03:02:49.689 --> 03:02:51.652]  It's you're going to see that all this stuff is peanuts.
[03:02:51.972 --> 03:02:55.653]  Right, to go down and get, go through Mexico and document this stuff, it's not that big of a deal.
[03:02:55.673 --> 03:02:59.294]  As a matter of fact, it's like, I'm like, not even at the base camp of the mountain yet, right?
[03:02:59.774 --> 03:03:13.577]  But if you have it from the perspective of, whoa, this is really daunting, man, you know, I'm afraid to even go into this job interview, or you know, this is just my perspective as this person who's working behind a desk, and that's your entire worldview, then yeah, this seems incredibly daunting.
[03:03:13.617 --> 03:03:14.417]  And so my point is,
[03:03:15.217 --> 03:03:18.040]  Put yourself in the shoes of some of the greats of history.
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:19.081]  Compare yourself to that.
[03:03:19.461 --> 03:03:21.543]  Raise your sights above where they're currently at.
[03:03:21.603 --> 03:03:26.687]  And all of this becomes incredibly, honestly, trivial, almost, right?
[03:03:26.888 --> 03:03:28.549]  Well, the challenge becomes empowering.
[03:03:28.589 --> 03:03:32.433]  You realize it's harder to lay down and be run over than to stand up and fight.
[03:03:33.171 --> 03:03:33.551]  Correct.
[03:03:34.072 --> 03:03:34.392]  Correct.
[03:03:34.492 --> 03:03:34.972]  Absolutely.
[03:03:35.152 --> 03:03:35.532]  Absolutely.
[03:03:35.552 --> 03:03:37.434]  And then you also realize, well, there's no choice.
[03:03:37.594 --> 03:03:38.814]  And so what am I going to do?
[03:03:38.874 --> 03:03:41.416]  Am I just going to, like you said, am I going to stay here and get run over?
[03:03:41.456 --> 03:03:44.118]  Am I going to stand up and actually do something about it?
[03:03:44.158 --> 03:03:50.541]  So that's really all I can say, because honestly, if we don't do that, I mean, this country has but little precious time left.
[03:03:50.661 --> 03:03:53.103]  I mean, we're watching the murder of the Republic.
[03:03:53.223 --> 03:03:54.904]  The murder of the republic, the last place.
[03:03:54.964 --> 03:03:59.486]  I mean, I'm not the first person to say this, there is nowhere else to run to.
[03:03:59.827 --> 03:04:00.587]  Where are you going to go?
[03:04:00.627 --> 03:04:03.389]  Maybe if you're a mega-billionaire you could go to like Switzerland or something.
[03:04:03.709 --> 03:04:04.729]  But it's still some prison.
[03:04:04.769 --> 03:04:07.291]  And they're not going to be safe there either.
[03:04:07.591 --> 03:04:12.494]  A lot of the globals are digging bunkers everywhere in the middle of nowhere, like that's going to protect them.
[03:04:12.854 --> 03:04:14.935]  What would have protected them was empowering society.
[03:04:15.315 --> 03:04:19.658]  Oh, but their answer is a universal credit score and free money, which they admit to controls making it even more unstable.
[03:04:21.857 --> 03:04:23.118]  That's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:23.138 --> 03:04:23.778]  That's all I could say.
[03:04:23.959 --> 03:04:24.339]  Operate.
[03:04:24.399 --> 03:04:25.900]  Have a higher perspective.
[03:04:26.340 --> 03:04:26.500]  Right?
[03:04:27.321 --> 03:04:28.382]  Realistic optimism.
[03:04:29.002 --> 03:04:33.465]  And actually get off your, uh, you know, if I could say, get off your behind.
[03:04:33.525 --> 03:04:35.707]  I don't know if I, you know, I don't want to say anything inappropriate here for radio.
[03:04:36.067 --> 03:04:36.668]  Get off your ass.
[03:04:36.968 --> 03:04:37.848]  Anthony, I'm impressed.
[03:04:37.869 --> 03:04:40.010]  You already did the War Room yesterday, the American Journal this morning.
[03:04:40.310 --> 03:04:41.511]  Come back and see us again soon.
[03:04:41.591 --> 03:04:41.811]  Absolutely.
[03:04:41.831 --> 03:04:43.072]  We'll talk about your next mission soon.
[03:04:43.432 --> 03:04:43.913]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:44.093 --> 03:04:44.613]  Thank you, brother.
[03:04:44.633 --> 03:04:45.074]  Great job.
[03:04:45.454 --> 03:04:47.075]  All right, guest host takes over right now.
[03:04:47.095 --> 03:04:48.036]  The Noah Troyer in one hour.
[03:04:58.407 --> 03:05:02.130]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:05.632]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:05:06.032 --> 03:05:10.496]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[03:05:11.116 --> 03:05:13.258]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:05:13.578 --> 03:05:21.543]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[03:05:22.164 --> 03:05:23.485]  This is the Great Awakening.
[03:05:24.005 --> 03:05:27.910]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:05:28.370 --> 03:05:31.914]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:05:32.174 --> 03:05:34.697]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[03:05:35.038 --> 03:05:38.882]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:05:38.902 --> 03:05:39.402]  We're good to go.
[03:06:07.129 --> 03:06:10.390]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:10.431 --> 03:06:15.853]  I'm your guest host Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com and it is wonderful to be with you all today.
[03:06:15.873 --> 03:06:18.754]  I have a lot to get through today.
[03:06:18.774 --> 03:06:23.056]  Huge, huge developments out of Australia in terms of censorship.
[03:06:23.516 --> 03:06:34.221]  I want to take everyone through a bill that was approved in the UK earlier this year, just a couple of months ago, and what it actually means for countries like the UK.
[03:06:34.601 --> 03:06:48.308]  I want to make Americans aware that they are trying to bring in a digital ID there as well, and this is why this information is so crucial for you to understand, because Australia is the testing ground of the New World Order.
[03:06:48.348 --> 03:06:50.169]  Many people say Canada as well.
[03:06:50.669 --> 03:06:51.950]  Our countries were hit
[03:06:52.430 --> 03:07:01.333]  Incredibly, incredibly hard when it came to lockdowns, when it came to police tyranny, shooting at innocent protesters with rubber bullets in our country.
[03:07:01.733 --> 03:07:12.476]  In Canada, they locked innocent protesters up in burning hot cars, took them from the snow, locked them up in these cars, then released them back out into the cold as a method of torture.
[03:07:12.516 --> 03:07:15.337]  That was told to me by Rob Primo, who was there himself.
[03:07:15.857 --> 03:07:33.742]  And so what they did to us and you all know my very first broadcast when I was guest hosting the Alex Jones Show, I exposed the Melbourne experiment where the United Nations brags about the fact that they tested on Melbourne and that they want to turn every single country into a digital dictatorship.
[03:07:34.747 --> 03:07:37.888]  Permanent lockdowns like they did in Melbourne.
[03:07:37.908 --> 03:07:38.988]  There's that footage now.
[03:07:39.068 --> 03:07:39.908]  Who could forget it?
[03:07:40.348 --> 03:07:40.968]  These goons.
[03:07:40.988 --> 03:07:42.149]  Would you believe it, guys?
[03:07:42.669 --> 03:07:52.171]  The Victorian police, which is the state that you're seeing this footage out of, that shot at innocent protesters, just recently asked for a pay rise.
[03:07:52.771 --> 03:07:58.092]  They wrote on all their cars, you know, that they're not being paid enough.
[03:07:59.052 --> 03:08:01.273]  As if the people have forgotten that they did this.
[03:08:03.183 --> 03:08:04.924]  Are these guys worthy of a pay rise?
[03:08:04.964 --> 03:08:07.826]  But let me tell you, people took the higher ground.
[03:08:07.926 --> 03:08:14.629]  I had a proposal for Vicpol, which is what we call them here in Australia, and I said, Victoria Police, I have a proposal for you.
[03:08:14.709 --> 03:08:16.570]  I will personally rally for your pay rise.
[03:08:16.650 --> 03:08:21.233]  I will forgive that you did this if you go and investigate the criminals.
[03:08:22.159 --> 03:08:38.676]  The health ministers, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and all of the premiers and mainstream media that told the population that the COVID injections were safe and effective when they knew full well that it was going to kill them.
[03:08:40.074 --> 03:08:42.015]  So that's my proposal to Victoria Police.
[03:08:42.035 --> 03:08:43.896]  I'm going to say it on air again.
[03:08:44.036 --> 03:08:53.961]  If you investigate these people and prosecute the criminals that were responsible for bringing these crimes on the Australian people, on humanity, you will set a precedent for the entire world.
[03:08:53.981 --> 03:08:58.144]  You will be heralded as heroes and people will forgive you for those disgraceful acts.
[03:08:58.244 --> 03:09:00.385]  Until then, that's what you're remembered by.
[03:09:01.005 --> 03:09:08.291]  Now, I want to talk about some very, very important developments and I will bring this up in the next segment because I didn't prepare the team for it.
[03:09:08.611 --> 03:09:15.097]  There are two crucial bills right now in the United States to get out of the United Nations.
[03:09:15.177 --> 03:09:17.439]  This is a huge, huge story.
[03:09:17.959 --> 03:09:21.523]  Just sent to me by James Rogoski literally before I got on air.
[03:09:21.843 --> 03:09:26.528]  So I will get that over to the team on the break and show everyone those two bills.
[03:09:27.109 --> 03:09:30.892]  And really everyone needs to be rallying behind these senators right now.
[03:09:30.932 --> 03:09:34.776]  And it's relevant especially because of the conversation that Alex just had.
[03:09:36.218 --> 03:09:39.721]  That is what you're seeing on your screen right now is the Digital Identity Act.
[03:09:39.762 --> 03:09:40.883]  I'll get into that in a moment.
[03:09:41.701 --> 03:09:48.746]  Especially because of the conversation that Alex just had with that gentleman talking about the UN replacement migration.
[03:09:48.806 --> 03:10:02.737]  If anyone is unaware of that term or doesn't believe that that is what the UN is doing, literally just Google UN replacement migration and you will see that is a published agenda of the United Nations.
[03:10:02.797 --> 03:10:04.058]  They plan to replace you.
[03:10:04.358 --> 03:10:08.802]  They plan to destroy patriotism and turn you into a global citizen.
[03:10:08.822 --> 03:10:10.423]  And by the way, this has been published
[03:10:10.843 --> 03:10:14.628]  In their book, Remaking the World Towards an Age of Global Enlightenment.
[03:10:14.668 --> 03:10:17.812]  This is the UN100 and the Boston Global Forum.
[03:10:17.892 --> 03:10:28.705]  I've spoken about this before, but please, if you're not familiar with my series, go to zmedia.com, head to the interviews page and look up AI Apocalypse or the words Agenda 2045.
[03:10:30.066 --> 03:10:41.431]  I'm planning on compiling that four part series into one video and I will have it up on band very soon because it's, I think, one of the most important series I've ever done on this subject.
[03:10:41.891 --> 03:10:57.078]  But basically in that book, the United Nations or the UN 100 and the Boston Global Forum, which is headed up by Michael Dukakis, strangely enough, and Ursula von der Leyen has contributed and all of these insane people have contributed.
[03:10:57.848 --> 03:11:06.452]  In that book, Remaking the World Towards an Age of Global Enlightenment, they say you are now an AI world citizen inside the AI world society.
[03:11:06.492 --> 03:11:09.014]  You're an object in their digital world.
[03:11:09.054 --> 03:11:13.176]  They want to transition you from a real life into a fake life in the metaverse.
[03:11:13.676 --> 03:11:20.384]  And the way that they're going to do that is by through the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.
[03:11:20.825 --> 03:11:23.007]  It's too dangerous for you to be outside.
[03:11:23.027 --> 03:11:25.931]  You're going to cause a pandemic if you interact with nature.
[03:11:25.971 --> 03:11:28.353]  So we need to limit humans going into nature.
[03:11:28.714 --> 03:11:31.017]  We need to limit our emissions.
[03:11:31.932 --> 03:11:37.034]  We need to stop human beings from living their normal lives because it's harming the climate.
[03:11:37.074 --> 03:11:41.695]  Never mind that we fly around on private jets and eat succulent meats at COP28.
[03:11:41.855 --> 03:11:43.916]  Never mind that, peasants.
[03:11:44.316 --> 03:11:48.377]  You need to sit at home and live your life out in the metaverse.
[03:11:49.197 --> 03:11:53.858]  And so that is the published goal of the United Nations, everyone.
[03:11:54.239 --> 03:11:55.439]  I am not exaggerating.
[03:11:55.719 --> 03:11:56.839]  I am not exaggerating.
[03:11:57.199 --> 03:11:59.100]  These people are sick in the head.
[03:11:59.770 --> 03:12:01.392]  And they are particularly upset with me.
[03:12:01.592 --> 03:12:14.406]  Even Antonio Guterres' personal secretary responded to a hit piece about me, thanks to the Australian Associated Press, who refused to remove the label that I'm a prominent misinformation spreader.
[03:12:14.426 --> 03:12:16.268]  They continue to publish articles about it.
[03:12:16.348 --> 03:12:17.529]  More on that coming soon.
[03:12:17.789 --> 03:12:18.870]  We're watching you, AAP.
[03:12:19.671 --> 03:12:31.937]  And so the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, personal secretary, responded to a hit piece about me when I exposed that the United Nations are backing the 8 March principles.
[03:12:31.997 --> 03:12:33.238]  What are the 8 March principles?
[03:12:33.258 --> 03:12:35.719]  Well, they call for the legalization of pedophilia.
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:41.902]  Or, in other words, they call to decriminalize sex with minors.
[03:12:43.414 --> 03:12:52.702]  And the United Nations claims, oh, no, no, we just are supportive of decriminalising when minors have sex with minors.
[03:12:52.742 --> 03:12:56.005]  Well, that's not what the 8th March Principles says, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12:56.265 --> 03:13:01.770]  So if you're going to talk about sex with minors and what you're supporting, you better be as clear as day.
[03:13:04.093 --> 03:13:15.584]  And make it explicitly clear in your documentation that you're not actually talking about old men having sex with kids like you all do in the shadows.
[03:13:17.506 --> 03:13:17.686]  So!
[03:13:18.445 --> 03:13:35.730]  I want to really briefly, in light of the fact that Alex is now back on X and the team are being reinstated and InfoWars has been released out of the digital prison on X, I want to talk about something that Elon is doing in Australia right now.
[03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:45.673]  Team, if you can bring up the news.com.au article, X formerly Twitter fined $610,000 by the eSafety Commissioner for reporting failure.
[03:13:46.377 --> 03:14:04.656]  That is, and if you look at the second line in that headline, it says, X, formerly known as Twitter, has been fined more than $600,000 after failing to answer questions about how it's tackling online sexual crimes.
[03:14:04.716 --> 03:14:08.981]  That article, team, is the first one that I've sent through, if you can bring it up.
[03:14:09.725 --> 03:14:21.159]  And so, basically, the mainstream news outlets in Australia are reporting that X has been fined for failing to answer questions about tackling online sexual crimes.
[03:14:21.239 --> 03:14:23.182]  What they've failed to tell you, though,
[03:14:24.404 --> 03:14:38.087]  Is that, that's not the only thing that the eSafety Commissioner requested from X. She, which by the way, Trace Inman Grant, Julie Inman Grant, has become the head of the Ministry of Truth of Australia.
[03:14:38.128 --> 03:14:40.188]  What she says is a hate crime goes.
[03:14:40.728 --> 03:14:51.791]  What she's demanded of X is not just that, it's also about why X is essentially not tackling what they deem to be hate speech on the platform.
[03:14:52.498 --> 03:14:59.126]  So, so, X didn't respond to that because it's a ridiculous request because there is no hate speech.
[03:15:00.247 --> 03:15:13.582]  It's just free speech with people getting their feelings hurt and people declaring the fact that a biological man can't be a woman just because he dresses like one or just because he cuts off his genitals.
[03:15:15.626 --> 03:15:27.556]  There's just facts now on X and so of course people's feelings are hurt because they're not protected by the cushion of misinformation, the misinformation police on there anymore.
[03:15:28.336 --> 03:15:36.483]  And so after the break I want to show you how the same request was made of Google but they weren't fined.
[03:15:37.356 --> 03:15:38.417]  Only X was!
[03:15:39.057 --> 03:15:41.879]  And so Elon's fighting this back now and why is this important?
[03:15:41.939 --> 03:15:49.405]  It's important because of the legislation coming down the pipeline and something in particular that Elon said in that two hour space with Alex.
[03:15:49.705 --> 03:15:51.086]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:15:51.126 --> 03:15:51.987]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:52.007 --> 03:15:54.268]  This is information everyone needs to know.
[03:15:58.937 --> 03:16:02.998]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[03:16:03.058 --> 03:16:04.379]  You don't want my thanks.
[03:16:04.979 --> 03:16:08.360]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters.
[03:16:08.800 --> 03:16:10.941]  You want them off your back and off your children's back.
[03:16:11.281 --> 03:16:11.661]  You know what?
[03:16:12.121 --> 03:16:14.822]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[03:16:15.402 --> 03:16:20.784]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[03:16:22.008 --> 03:16:24.189]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists.
[03:16:24.729 --> 03:16:27.871]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[03:16:28.471 --> 03:16:29.552]  And I know you are as well.
[03:16:30.112 --> 03:16:32.493]  So thank you for standing with us, because you are the Infowar.
[03:16:32.513 --> 03:16:35.734]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us however you can.
[03:16:36.115 --> 03:16:42.498]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar.
[03:16:42.518 --> 03:16:44.839]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[03:16:45.911 --> 03:16:47.434]  You have made history.
[03:16:47.514 --> 03:16:48.717]  We have made history together.
[03:16:48.737 --> 03:16:53.507]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[03:16:53.988 --> 03:16:55.791]  And I suggest you use it.
[03:16:57.248 --> 03:17:00.729]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:17:02.110 --> 03:17:06.332]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.

[03:18:02.609 --> 03:18:12.451]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[03:18:13.451 --> 03:18:13.892]  I think so.
[03:18:37.055 --> 03:18:37.415]  I think so.
[03:18:57.160 --> 03:19:06.303]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[03:19:06.783 --> 03:19:07.663]  You would rally against it?
[03:19:07.683 --> 03:19:08.224]  You would fight it?
[03:19:08.604 --> 03:19:09.964]  And that's what we're doing.
[03:19:10.444 --> 03:19:11.545]  This is the reality of 2023.

[03:19:58.281 --> 03:20:04.185]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.614 --> 03:20:14.394]  Welcome back!
[03:20:14.574 --> 03:20:31.897]  Well, the great news that I have for everyone today, and it's absolutely monumental news, is that there are two bills right now in the United States that seek to fully withdraw the U.S.
[03:20:31.957 --> 03:20:37.538]  from the United Nations and the World Health Organization and all of their associated entities.
[03:20:38.300 --> 03:20:43.465]  The two bills in question and the team can bring them up are H.R.
[03:20:43.485 --> 03:20:46.647]  6645 and S.
[03:20:46.667 --> 03:20:46.647]  3428.
[03:20:47.108 --> 03:20:59.939]  These two companion pieces of legislation in the House and the Senate seek to have the United States exit the UN and exit the World Health Organization and all related conventions and agreements.
[03:20:59.979 --> 03:21:05.724]  And I want to give props to Representative Chip Roy in Texas and Representative Mike Rogers
[03:21:06.611 --> 03:21:18.636]  They are the sponsor and initial co-sponsor of HR6645 and Senator Mike Lee in Utah has sponsored identical companion legislation in the Senate.
[03:21:18.676 --> 03:21:18.896]  That's S3428.
[03:21:18.916 --> 03:21:19.637]  Congratulations!
[03:21:22.618 --> 03:21:23.018]  We're good.
[03:21:45.385 --> 03:21:58.270]  If you go to jamesrogalski.substack.com or just enter the address stoptheglobalagenda.com, you can support these representatives bringing this in.
[03:21:58.390 --> 03:22:05.412]  I'm telling you this is one of the most important things your country can do because we can continue to address the symptoms.
[03:22:05.472 --> 03:22:13.835]  Every time you see pedophile story time being pushed in schools or libraries or whatever it may be,
[03:22:14.958 --> 03:22:24.129]  Uh, you know, you can put out that little fire and kudos to the people that do, but it will not stop if you do not cut out the root of the cancer.
[03:22:24.409 --> 03:22:34.501]  And the root of the cancer is the United Nations and the WHO who talk about the fact that we need to teach children about sex and masturbation and things that just do not belong
[03:22:35.121 --> 03:22:36.482]  In a child's mind.
[03:22:55.531 --> 03:23:00.634]  And look at the Exit the United Nations and the WHO publication and everyone get behind this.
[03:23:00.734 --> 03:23:02.355]  Again, there is an action item there.
[03:23:02.775 --> 03:23:04.056]  Everyone can take action.
[03:23:04.696 --> 03:23:14.562]  You can see that Representative Chip Roy stated that this year the UN's corruption and its despicable brazen political agenda have been on full display.
[03:23:14.962 --> 03:23:20.125]  Senator Mike Lee, pardon me, said no more blank checks for the United Nations.
[03:23:20.285 --> 03:23:23.287]  Americans' hard-earned dollars have been funneled into initiatives
[03:23:23.627 --> 03:23:29.196]  That fly in the face of our values enabling tyrants, betraying allies and spreading bigotry.
[03:23:29.496 --> 03:23:32.441]  With the Defund Act we're stepping away from this debacle.
[03:23:32.621 --> 03:23:33.903]  Huge, huge news.
[03:23:34.304 --> 03:23:36.347]  So please share that everywhere with everyone.
[03:23:37.265 --> 03:23:48.499]  OK, just before I move on to the digital ID aspect of this broadcast today, I want to show you what the E-Safety Commissioner published.
[03:23:48.559 --> 03:23:55.247]  And this is what the mainstream media in Australia and everywhere around the world isn't talking about when it comes to this fine for Eamon.
[03:23:56.828 --> 03:24:12.553]  Guys, if you bring up the link, the second link that I sent, which is the esafety.gov.au link, Basic Online Safety Expectations, and they've said that this is the summary of industry responses to mandatory transparency notices.
[03:24:12.613 --> 03:24:14.674]  If you can't find the link, it's no big deal.
[03:24:15.214 --> 03:24:18.875]  But this was the official publication of the eSafety Commissioner.
[03:24:19.876 --> 03:24:23.178]  Who, again, is like the head of the Ministry of Truth in Australia.
[03:24:23.198 --> 03:24:26.421]  She's worked with the White House, loves, like, all this trans stuff.
[03:24:27.122 --> 03:24:46.819]  And October 2023, this was published and what their findings were, were that not only did X not respond to this ridiculous request about hate speech, there it is, everyone can view this, I've read the report and I've read what their findings were.
[03:24:47.836 --> 03:24:54.998]  And they openly say in that report that Google also didn't meet the expectations about child safety.
[03:24:56.078 --> 03:25:11.362]  Google also didn't meet the expectations of X. Google also didn't respond in a timely manner just as X didn't, except the difference is Google walked away with a slap on the wrist, a simple warning, while X was fined over $600,000.
[03:25:14.028 --> 03:25:17.511]  And so this is absolutely vital for everyone to understand.
[03:25:17.531 --> 03:25:23.155]  And I know that everyone's still going through the process of feeling their way out about Elon.
[03:25:23.295 --> 03:25:24.816]  I've been very open about this.
[03:25:25.137 --> 03:25:28.659]  But I will say that actions speak louder than words.
[03:25:29.220 --> 03:25:34.043]  And so far, Elon has been taking action to actually protect free speech.
[03:25:34.103 --> 03:25:38.347]  What he's doing now in return is suing the eSafety Commission.
[03:25:38.667 --> 03:25:41.469]  X is actually suing them back for this fine.
[03:25:41.829 --> 03:25:42.630]  And so I hope
[03:25:43.343 --> 03:25:45.427]  I hope that they succeed in that.
[03:25:45.828 --> 03:25:46.529]  I really do.
[03:25:46.549 --> 03:25:50.877]  The Commissioner has been behaving like an absolute tyrant in our country.
[03:25:54.996 --> 03:26:03.722]  Now, I want to show everyone, team, if you can bring up HR 4258, you had it up before, the Improving Digital Identity Act of 2021.
[03:26:04.242 --> 03:26:08.605]  This is a bill that was introduced in the United States on the 30th of June 2021.
[03:26:09.205 --> 03:26:14.349]  Now, there hasn't been a whole lot of progress on the bill since.
[03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:18.011]  That doesn't mean that it's not a danger to your country.
[03:26:19.031 --> 03:26:27.834]  I'm going to talk to you in a moment about the Online Safety Act in the UK and the Digital ID Bill in Australia and why this matters for the whole world.
[03:26:27.994 --> 03:26:30.735]  I know that Europe has also introduced similar things.
[03:26:31.356 --> 03:26:36.718]  And if the US thinks that it's not going to come to you, it's already there.
[03:26:36.778 --> 03:26:38.198]  It's already been proposed.
[03:26:38.678 --> 03:26:40.499]  It's just sitting there dormant.
[03:26:41.264 --> 03:26:46.547]  And the online safety bill in the UK that I mentioned earlier in this broadcast, and I've sent that link to the team.
[03:26:46.567 --> 03:26:48.068]  You don't really have to bring it up, guys.
[03:26:48.948 --> 03:26:50.249]  But it's passed.
[03:26:50.329 --> 03:26:51.729]  It's actually passed.
[03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:56.672]  And this was a six-year journey to get this bill to where it is.
[03:26:56.692 --> 03:27:00.674]  I want to read some of the alarming things from it.
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:04.542]  It's a regulatory framework for freedom of speech.
[03:27:04.582 --> 03:27:09.286]  Think about having a regulatory framework for, quote, freedom of speech.
[03:27:10.126 --> 03:27:13.349]  It defeats the purpose of even saying freedom of speech.
[03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:17.212]  What it is, is a regulatory framework for speech in general.
[03:27:18.533 --> 03:27:23.256]  And under the pursuit, under the guise of what they call duty of care for big tech,
[03:27:24.465 --> 03:27:36.150]  They introduced it in 2021 and started to get it pushed through and it went from, you know, 145 pages to over 260 pages by 2023.
[03:27:36.530 --> 03:27:44.513]  And they say they want to protect users from harmful material, which is exactly what Julie Inman Grant claims she's doing, except
[03:27:45.265 --> 03:27:50.468]  She'll fine X, but she won't fine Google for not protecting people from harmful material.
[03:27:50.648 --> 03:27:51.788]  That's really weird, isn't it?
[03:27:52.209 --> 03:27:54.570]  That's really, really weird, Julianne McGrath.
[03:27:56.064 --> 03:28:14.318]  The good thing about the Online Safety Act in the UK is that it stops children from gaining access to adult content and you would see that now certain countries are requiring people to take a selfie before they view adult content online.
[03:28:14.338 --> 03:28:16.179]  I'm not sure how I feel about that.
[03:28:16.659 --> 03:28:20.022]  However, what I want to say here is that they
[03:28:20.825 --> 03:28:24.007]  They claim that they're protecting children from adult content.
[03:28:24.087 --> 03:28:28.210]  It's all done under this guise because everyone agrees they want to protect children, right?
[03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:40.718]  But what it is, is that's the cloak for what they're actually doing, which is locking you into what they call a zero-trust internet model, where everything you do is tracked and traced and monitored online.
[03:28:41.483 --> 03:28:45.888]  And then, the responsibilities put on Big Tech to track, trace and monitor.
[03:28:46.048 --> 03:28:49.993]  And when they can't comply, they have to leave the country, which is happening in the UK.
[03:28:50.193 --> 03:28:52.336]  Don't go anywhere, this is relevant to everyone.
[03:28:57.580 --> 03:28:59.962]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[03:29:00.722 --> 03:29:05.645]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[03:29:06.166 --> 03:29:17.513]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[03:29:18.074 --> 03:29:21.996]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[03:29:22.677 --> 03:29:23.737]  Get X2 now.
[03:29:23.798 --> 03:29:24.838]  It could be the last run ever.
[03:29:24.878 --> 03:29:25.619]  We get shut down.
[03:29:26.059 --> 03:29:26.920]  While you still can,

[03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:49.411]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family, but has the opposite effect.
[03:29:49.871 --> 03:29:53.393]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[03:29:53.573 --> 03:29:55.234]  X2, back in stock right now.

[03:31:01.519 --> 03:31:06.061]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[03:31:06.702 --> 03:31:09.643]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[03:31:10.144 --> 03:31:10.904]  Well, I know where you are.
[03:31:11.224 --> 03:31:15.186]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.

[03:31:22.310 --> 03:31:23.491]  And a key tool in that fight
[03:31:24.071 --> 03:31:28.873]  This is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[03:31:29.293 --> 03:31:32.515]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[03:31:32.935 --> 03:31:35.836]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book.
[03:31:36.597 --> 03:31:40.658]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[03:31:40.959 --> 03:31:44.920]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists and it funds the Info War.

[03:32:17.285 --> 03:32:24.812]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[03:32:24.832 --> 03:32:26.493]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[03:32:26.934 --> 03:32:28.095]  Keep sharing the articles and videos.

[03:32:58.112 --> 03:33:03.994]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.315 --> 03:33:18.337]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.437 --> 03:33:23.061]  I'm your guest host Maria ZFZMedia.com and it's an honour to be with you today.
[03:33:23.081 --> 03:33:40.775]  Before the break we were talking about a potential positive aspect of the UK's Online Safety Act but when you hear the rest of what this allows the UK government to do and it's exactly what they're trying to do in Australia, all of Europe and I dare say eventually in the United States as well considering you've already got a bill there.
[03:33:42.457 --> 03:33:43.158]  Listen to this.
[03:33:43.519 --> 03:33:48.346]  This bill has allowed the government to read all of your messages on Meta.
[03:33:49.136 --> 03:33:53.877]  On all apps, but also on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Signal.
[03:33:53.937 --> 03:34:09.780]  And it's so dystopian and so invasive that WhatsApp and Signal have actually said, we will no longer be able to provide our apps, our services in the UK, because this completely violates our customers, our users' privacy.
[03:34:09.820 --> 03:34:16.761]  We can't uphold our privacy, you know, commitment to our customers.
[03:34:17.449 --> 03:34:18.349]  With this in place.
[03:34:19.050 --> 03:34:21.831]  And so they're saying they're now having to leave the UK.
[03:34:21.851 --> 03:34:31.015]  It has real-time monitoring of your messages, which means even as you're typing them on Signal or WhatsApp.
[03:34:31.055 --> 03:34:43.000]  Now think about this, you know, Tucker Carlson spoke about the fact that his Signal was being watched by the government when he was, you know, arranging to interview President Putin.
[03:34:44.207 --> 03:34:48.590]  And that was a huge thing, that his signal was being spied on.
[03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:54.695]  No one should be spied on, especially not journalists, just trying to organise a conversation.
[03:34:55.415 --> 03:35:00.499]  But the UK government has gone so far as to say they can constantly spy on these apps.
[03:35:01.522 --> 03:35:08.808]  There's a fine of £18 million or $32 million, sorry, for Big Tech if they don't comply.
[03:35:08.828 --> 03:35:19.617]  And then senior managers at Big Tech face fines and criminal prosecution, jail time, if they don't police content online, users.
[03:35:20.219 --> 03:35:21.961]  Can get six months of jail time.
[03:35:22.421 --> 03:35:34.154]  Remember the journalist, Alex Harimono, his name's escaping me right now, but he's the one who broke the story about Trudeau welcoming an actual Nazi into Parliament and the standing ovation that happened there.
[03:35:34.554 --> 03:35:36.876]  And he was actually arrested for that in the UK.
[03:35:37.717 --> 03:35:44.318]  So this is, they're talking about six months of jail time for anyone who tells the truth in the UK.
[03:35:44.698 --> 03:35:46.339]  This is regular people, yeah?
[03:35:46.359 --> 03:35:50.100]  So you know how Alex always says, they came after me and then they're going to come after you.
[03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:57.881]  They'll debank, they'll de-platform, they'll do all of this as a test case for the people and then they'll do it to the rest of the people.
[03:35:57.901 --> 03:36:01.782]  This is what the digital dictatorship social credit system is, guys.
[03:36:02.751 --> 03:36:03.772]  This is what it is.
[03:36:04.452 --> 03:36:07.335]  And it's not just a temporary freezing of your bank account.
[03:36:07.715 --> 03:36:14.881]  You are permanently not allowed to participate in society because you said the wrong thing, you thought the wrong thing, you didn't get enough injections.
[03:36:16.202 --> 03:36:18.164]  This is their model for the future.
[03:36:19.085 --> 03:36:34.771]  This is why it's so important, these two bills that I mentioned before about the United States exiting the UN and the WHO because they're the ones that are bringing this stuff forward is so crucial for everyone and I might get the team to bring it up again at the end of the broadcast but...
[03:36:36.072 --> 03:36:46.400]  It allows the government, through their government-approved software, to scan through your phone, files, photos, everything, for what they say is illegal content.
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:49.422]  And of course, that term is broad and can change every single day.
[03:36:50.683 --> 03:36:59.449]  They say that it's going to be used to, quote-unquote, clamp down on online trolls, but it requires big tech to verify all users.
[03:36:59.490 --> 03:37:02.652]  And this is where we come into the Australian discussion.
[03:37:03.823 --> 03:37:06.785]  Tim, if you can bring up Senator Malcolm Roberts.
[03:37:07.666 --> 03:37:11.809]  He's tweeted two things and made a request of Elon.
[03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:20.916]  And in this, in his request, basically what's happened is there's a senator in Australia who's introduced this digital ID bill here.
[03:37:20.936 --> 03:37:22.897]  Her name is Senator Katie Gallagher.
[03:37:23.818 --> 03:37:31.384]  Anyone who wants to learn more about her can go and look up a video on YouTube on Senator Gallagher and mansplaining where she made an absolute
[03:37:31.784 --> 03:37:34.265]  Full of herself, and that went viral.
[03:37:34.625 --> 03:37:42.988]  But dear Elon Musk, this is Senator Malcolm Roberts who said this, and you would all recall, regular viewers of this broadcast, he's been on here with me.
[03:37:43.088 --> 03:37:47.689]  Very brave senator, fantastic senator out of Australia, who came on InfoWars.
[03:37:48.029 --> 03:37:48.769]  We love him here.
[03:37:49.630 --> 03:37:56.252]  But he's talking about the fact that senators in Australia can turn off their comments, and it's a threat to Australian democracy.
[03:37:56.292 --> 03:38:00.193]  So he's actually making an appeal here to Elon to stop
[03:38:01.418 --> 03:38:05.373]  Government representatives being able to censor comments.
[03:38:06.092 --> 03:38:19.356]  Because Senator Katie Gallagher, who introduced the Digital ID Bill, you know, for safeguarding and transparency and all of these buzzwords they like to use, is so transparent that she has her comments off.
[03:38:19.636 --> 03:38:20.976]  And let me play you a clip.
[03:38:21.196 --> 03:38:24.777]  Guys, if you can cue up the clip of Senator Gallagher.
[03:38:24.797 --> 03:38:28.278]  It's called Katie Gallagher, Digital ID.
[03:38:28.738 --> 03:38:31.579]  And just watch what she actually said in our Parliament.
[03:38:32.319 --> 03:38:33.680]  This is the single biggest
[03:38:34.727 --> 03:38:41.552]  When you meet with business, when you meet with small business, this is the thing that they want in place.
[03:38:41.612 --> 03:38:45.095]  They want a regulator in place, they want legislation around it.
[03:38:45.215 --> 03:38:49.198]  It is not about giving anybody a digital identity.
[03:38:53.241 --> 03:38:56.204]  The bill's called the Digital ID Bill.
[03:38:56.224 --> 03:39:02.769]  It's not about giving anyone a digital identity, she says.
[03:39:03.619 --> 03:39:06.921]  As she introduces the digital ID bill.
[03:39:09.503 --> 03:39:13.486]  Guys, can you play the clip of Matt Canavan responding to that, please?
[03:39:15.302 --> 03:39:21.408]  I just heard the minister in her contribution say that this bill is not about a digital identity.
[03:39:21.928 --> 03:39:24.071]  The bill is called the Digital ID Bill 2023!
[03:39:24.231 --> 03:39:28.755]  I mean, talk about misinformation here!
[03:39:29.396 --> 03:39:34.521]  Why is your bill called the Digital ID Bill 2023 if it's not about providing a digital ID?
[03:39:37.926 --> 03:39:50.117]  And if you see here, digital ID is not compulsory, it's voluntary, secure and convenient way for you to access online services safely without having your personal documents stored by third parties.
[03:39:50.157 --> 03:39:50.857]  That is false.
[03:39:51.918 --> 03:39:57.123]  Guys, if you can bring up where she actually got community noted, I retweeted, but you can't
[03:39:57.583 --> 03:39:59.584]  You can't actually mention her even.
[03:39:59.664 --> 03:40:02.005]  She's a serving representative.
[03:40:02.025 --> 03:40:03.326]  You can't comment on her stuff.
[03:40:03.346 --> 03:40:04.326]  You can't mention her.
[03:40:04.346 --> 03:40:06.627]  But she got community noted on that.
[03:40:06.708 --> 03:40:14.411]  Labeling digital ID as voluntary can be misleading if it becomes an implicit requirement for essential services.
[03:40:14.451 --> 03:40:15.892]  And that is exactly the point.
[03:40:16.212 --> 03:40:27.178]  So this Senator who says this is not about a digital ID as she introduces this monster legislation which I spent a huge amount of time reading yesterday.
[03:40:27.439 --> 03:40:28.659]  Digital ID Bill.
[03:40:28.739 --> 03:40:30.420]  It's not about a digital ID.
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:32.982]  Gets mocked in Parliament.
[03:40:34.002 --> 03:40:37.965]  She's, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:40:37.985 --> 03:40:43.588]  Is also posting misinformation on X, getting community noted.
[03:40:44.955 --> 03:40:49.976]  Getting called out by other Senators for the fact that she's got all her comments off, she can't be mentioned.
[03:40:51.056 --> 03:41:03.638]  She is promoting censorship on her own ex-account and yet she wants to talk to us about transparency and keeping people safe online and businesses are apparently demanding.
[03:41:04.099 --> 03:41:05.579]  Businesses are demanding!
[03:41:06.279 --> 03:41:10.540]  This is when she goes out and talks to businesses, they all want a digital ID!
[03:41:10.580 --> 03:41:10.840]  Really?
[03:41:12.344 --> 03:41:23.787]  Pretty sure small businesses are still trying to claw back their costs from the time that people like you, Senator Gallagher, supported lockdowns and injection mandates.
[03:41:23.827 --> 03:41:26.688]  Which, by the way, weren't compulsory either.
[03:41:27.348 --> 03:41:28.509]  Remember that, everyone?
[03:41:29.149 --> 03:41:31.190]  Injections weren't compulsory either.
[03:41:31.330 --> 03:41:34.731]  You just had to get one to keep your job and keep feeding your children.
[03:41:34.751 --> 03:41:39.112]  Yeah, voluntary.
[03:41:39.918 --> 03:41:43.382]  But this digital ID bill in Australia is very, very dystopian.
[03:41:43.402 --> 03:41:45.424]  And it matters for the whole world.
[03:41:45.905 --> 03:41:51.390]  In the next segment, I'm going to talk about how Bill Gates is actually trying to roll this out worldwide.
[03:41:52.211 --> 03:41:52.612]  And again,
[03:41:55.724 --> 03:42:06.654]  When you see this type of thing happening in lockstep in every country like you did with COVID, like you did with the lockdowns, like you are with climate change, you know that there's a wider agenda at play here.
[03:42:07.014 --> 03:42:11.998]  And so just because it's happening over the other side of the world doesn't mean it's not important to everyone.
[03:42:12.018 --> 03:42:13.940]  That's why I spoke about the UK bill.
[03:42:14.300 --> 03:42:18.985]  What has just been imposed on the UK population is horrific.
[03:42:19.045 --> 03:42:20.426]  We should rally behind them.
[03:42:20.786 --> 03:42:24.669]  What they're trying to impose on the Australian population is horrific!
[03:42:25.329 --> 03:42:34.396]  What they did to Canadians when they made it so that you can't see local accounts that are desperately trying to tell them the truth is horrific!
[03:42:35.501 --> 03:42:49.966]  So this is happening absolutely everywhere and X is like the last bastion of a mainstream platform right now that exists for us to get this truth out there in this arms race to defeat censorship.
[03:42:49.986 --> 03:42:52.987]  So we're going to talk on that in the last segment.
[03:42:53.027 --> 03:42:53.867]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.408 --> 03:42:55.628]  We'll be back after this short break.
[03:42:57.066 --> 03:43:06.213]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[03:43:06.673 --> 03:43:07.573]  You would rally against it?
[03:43:07.593 --> 03:43:08.134]  You would fight it?
[03:43:08.494 --> 03:43:09.855]  And that's what we're doing.
[03:43:10.335 --> 03:43:11.436]  This is the reality of 2023.
[03:43:12.657 --> 03:43:27.360]  I just want to thank listeners and viewers for your last year's support, and I want to encourage you now more than ever to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to take clips and share it from the broadcast, and to buy products that enrich your life at infowarestore.com.

[03:44:08.972 --> 03:44:09.472]  Knockout?

[03:44:11.912 --> 03:44:12.372]  What's better?
[03:44:12.432 --> 03:44:14.033]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:44:14.713 --> 03:44:19.634]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[03:44:20.333 --> 03:44:23.917]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:44:24.297 --> 03:44:25.618]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:44:25.638 --> 03:44:26.559]  They're all very diverse.
[03:44:26.940 --> 03:44:37.129]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years, that people love, and sold for a lower price, under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[03:46:58.234 --> 03:47:04.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.118 --> 03:47:18.654]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with your host, Maria Z.
[03:47:24.093 --> 03:47:25.074]  Welcome back guys.
[03:47:25.314 --> 03:47:30.817]  Right before the break I showed you a tweet from Senator Malcolm Roberts who's a great senator we have here in Australia.
[03:47:30.837 --> 03:47:45.667]  He's been on this broadcast with me before and he was appealing to Elon to restrict Australian senators from censoring the Australian public on X. So what's happening now?
[03:47:46.187 --> 03:48:01.151]  I've heard people raise their concerns about, you know, a honeypot situation on X where everyone's sort of gathered onto one mainstream platform and, you know, not focusing on others perhaps, and I really don't think that that's the case.
[03:48:01.851 --> 03:48:14.760]  You know, I'm very, very loyal to my Telegram audience who've really, you know, followed me in there from the start because I was so heavily censored and all of the people that, you know, followed me on Rumble.
[03:48:15.060 --> 03:48:16.241]  These platforms are still...
[03:48:17.222 --> 03:48:21.525]  Particularly Rumble, you know, absolutely going to be depended on.
[03:48:21.545 --> 03:48:24.307]  I think that we have to fight with everything that we have.
[03:48:24.768 --> 03:48:27.370]  And right now X is a very, very powerful tool.
[03:48:27.450 --> 03:48:38.219]  And it's a powerful tool because Australian senators can make appeals to people like Elon Musk and say, hey, we've actually got people in Australia, senators who are breaking the law.
[03:48:38.639 --> 03:48:44.484]  Essentially, it's violating our constitution by silencing their own constituents.
[03:48:45.224 --> 03:48:54.295]  And it's important because Elon mentioned something when he was talking with Alex on that space, which was a fantastic space.
[03:48:54.775 --> 03:48:56.197]  People have got to go back and listen to it.
[03:48:56.829 --> 03:49:02.174]  But he was saying that we're going to operate within the confines of the law in each country.
[03:49:02.775 --> 03:49:18.709]  And so when something like this UK Online Safety Act comes out, or when something like this digital ID bill in Australia comes out, and you've got WhatsApp and Signal in the UK saying we can no longer provide this service to this country, we have to leave the UK.
[03:49:18.809 --> 03:49:20.411]  Do you know how huge that is?
[03:49:21.451 --> 03:49:25.252]  So the next thing is, if they do this in Australia, the same thing will happen.
[03:49:25.272 --> 03:49:40.334]  Any big tech organisation with integrity will say, I can't allow you to read our users' screens in real time or access their devices in real time, which, by the way, the Australian Digital ID Bill mentions in there as well.
[03:49:40.695 --> 03:49:48.636]  And so I'm going to be interviewing a senator here in Australia, hopefully this week, to really delve into the details of this bill, but I want to
[03:49:49.457 --> 03:49:52.480]  At a first glance, go over some stuff really quickly with everyone.
[03:49:53.821 --> 03:50:10.878]  From the outset, it says the Digital ID Standards Chair may make digital ID data standards about various matters, including technical integration requirements for entities to participate in the Australian government digital ID system and if required to do so,
[03:50:12.555 --> 03:50:12.956]  Bye, bye.
[03:50:19.967 --> 03:50:45.724]  Right now it's not mandatory, but we may make it a rule that integration has to happen with the digital ID system, meaning that all of a sudden the services that you can access get smaller and smaller and smaller online until you go and do it through the digital ID platform, which is what the UK has done.
[03:50:46.364 --> 03:50:52.792]  It also allows for, it says that this Act extends to Acts, Emissions, Matters and Things outside of Australia.
[03:50:52.872 --> 03:50:57.678]  It allows for extra-territorial operation, which is terrifying.
[03:51:00.279 --> 03:51:03.301]  And then it talks about restricted attributes of individuals.
[03:51:03.381 --> 03:51:24.891]  Now, I want to say that they do say that it's not permitted to collect these restricted attributes, but then they have a whole section in the bill where they say, oh, you can collect restricted attributes for all these different reasons and, you know, essentially you're not meant to profile someone online, but you can do it under these circumstances.
[03:51:25.011 --> 03:51:25.872]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:51:26.312 --> 03:51:28.192]  But this is what a restricted attribute is.
[03:51:28.272 --> 03:51:31.113]  Listen to what they're able to collect with this bill.
[03:51:31.753 --> 03:51:32.833]  Health information.
[03:51:32.853 --> 03:51:38.775]  An identifier of the individual that's been issued or assigned on behalf of the government.
[03:51:39.775 --> 03:51:44.116]  Information or an opinion about the individual's criminal record.
[03:51:45.316 --> 03:51:50.617]  Information about their membership in a trade association or a trade union.
[03:51:50.637 --> 03:51:55.198]  Other information or opinion that is associated with an individual.
[03:51:56.187 --> 03:51:57.648]  Biometric information.
[03:52:00.030 --> 03:52:06.635]  The entity, I've skipped a couple of pages, but biometric information as well.
[03:52:07.135 --> 03:52:18.864]  And again, it says that, you know, it gives you two full pages here of reasons why you can collect restricted attributes of an individual.
[03:52:20.490 --> 03:52:32.905]  And so then they go on to talk about, basically, when you make the rules about whether you can collect this stuff, it's really just up to the minister, whether the minister considers it relevant.
[03:52:32.965 --> 03:52:39.734]  Mind you, this is an unelected person, much like Julie Inman Grant, the East Safety Commissioner, going after X.
[03:52:40.194 --> 03:52:47.436]  This minister is an unelected person, no one in Australia elected them, saying, oh, well, I think it's relevant and I think this should happen.
[03:52:47.696 --> 03:52:53.517]  And it does go on to say in the bill that they can basically make these rules up as they go to big tech.
[03:52:53.537 --> 03:53:03.180]  So at any time they can say to X, you now need to do this, otherwise you're going to be fined, you know, every single day.
[03:53:03.300 --> 03:53:07.161]  And the penalties are quite high, just like Julie Inman Grant fined X.
[03:53:09.230 --> 03:53:13.776]  And so, digital IDs must be deactivated on request.
[03:53:13.957 --> 03:53:23.689]  I found this very, very important because what I'm reading this as is that they say that they can deactivate a person.
[03:53:24.270 --> 03:53:31.735]  I'm not saying, you know, this isn't necessarily protecting the individual where they say, OK, I signed up, but now I don't want to be signed up anymore.
[03:53:31.755 --> 03:53:42.041]  I'm seeing it as, well, your social credit score can be deactivated on request and your services for all things online can be suspended immediately.
[03:53:42.081 --> 03:53:43.702]  It doesn't specify either or.
[03:53:44.222 --> 03:53:50.387]  And we all know how far reaching the powers that these dictators that write this kind of legislation are.
[03:53:50.947 --> 03:53:59.253]  They say that requirements, that they can have device access, device or browser access.
[03:53:59.793 --> 03:54:03.116]  The government having access to your device or your browser.
[03:54:05.449 --> 03:54:20.400]  Again, they say that there are restrictions on collecting, using or disclosing biometric information of individuals and on data profiling to track online behaviour, but then they give all these reasons as to why it could be done.
[03:54:20.860 --> 03:54:27.005]  And it doesn't apply if the entity destroys the attribute, for example.
[03:54:27.125 --> 03:54:33.230]  If they, as soon as practicable after becoming aware that they have collected this stuff,
[03:54:34.921 --> 03:54:47.085]  It says, even if an individual's racial or ethnic origin can be reasonably inferred from the individual's name or place of birth, this does not prevent the individual's name or place of birth from being collected.
[03:54:47.165 --> 03:54:52.667]  So they go on to keep saying there's all these protections, but there kind of isn't.
[03:54:54.303 --> 03:55:01.267]  And they also basically talk about, you know, restricting disclosure of what they call unique identifiers.
[03:55:01.347 --> 03:55:08.051]  But then they talk about all the reasons how and why they can disclose these unique identifiers.
[03:55:08.371 --> 03:55:17.897]  And it's between what they call accredited entities or relying parties, which are, of course, chosen by one person or a team of people that nobody elected.
[03:55:18.695 --> 03:55:25.637]  And finally, I want to say here, and we're still seeking legal clarification on this, but listen to this insanity right here.
[03:55:25.937 --> 03:55:27.457]  Protection from civil action.
[03:55:28.078 --> 03:55:43.642]  This section applies to the Minister, Digital ID Regulator, basically everyone in government, plus the staff, just everyone, in the exercise, purported exercise, or any powers of this Act.
[03:55:44.696 --> 03:56:03.844]  Which means that anyone in the government is completely exempt from being held accountable for anything that goes wrong with this act, any violation of privacy, anything that could ruin this person's life, having this digital ID and all of this protected information collected about them.
[03:56:04.324 --> 03:56:08.406]  The government is completely exempt, much like the misinformation bill here in Australia.
[03:56:09.727 --> 03:56:12.808]  You know, the mainstream media and the government are exempt.
[03:56:13.789 --> 03:56:16.511]  From penalties if they spread misinformation.
[03:56:17.851 --> 03:56:25.936]  Finally, I want to really quickly in this in this last minute, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, digital IDs are an effective tool against poverty.
[03:56:25.996 --> 03:56:30.218]  This is their global digital ID system that they are trying to implement.
[03:56:31.159 --> 03:56:36.342]  And so if you go guys to Country Partners, the second link,
[03:56:37.457 --> 03:56:58.164]  And you scroll all the way down, you can actually see that this Global Digital ID, M-O-S-I-P, is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and NORAD, N-O-R-A-D, and on their research partners page, United States, is Oregon State University.
[03:56:58.883 --> 03:57:10.734]  Now, everything that I've just told you about this Australian bill that is so, so dystopian, bear in mind the United States has a current bill and the bill on Melinda Gates is trying to do this on a global scale.
[03:57:10.774 --> 03:57:17.861]  So I go back to what I said earlier, please go to jamesraguski's substack or stoptheglobalagenda.com if you're in the United States.
[03:57:18.381 --> 03:57:20.143]  Exit these insane
[03:57:20.923 --> 03:57:26.086]  Maniac organizations, the UN and the WHO that are pushing all of this.
[03:57:26.206 --> 03:57:29.348]  Global Vax Pass, global digital ID, global everything.
[03:57:29.568 --> 03:57:29.889]  No!
[03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:35.192]  We say no to globalism and I'm so so glad that the US is currently leading the way.
[03:57:35.232 --> 03:57:38.994]  Please go and support these wonderful senators and share this information everywhere.
[03:57:39.394 --> 03:57:40.055]  God bless you all.
[03:57:40.115 --> 03:57:41.255]  It's been great to be with you.

[03:58:52.577 --> 03:58:56.959]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:58:57.399 --> 03:58:59.880]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:59:00.440 --> 03:59:09.823]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
