[00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.874]  Here we are in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.036]  Less than a day after some freezing rain.
[00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:07.638]  Certainly laying down on the break of some trees.
[00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.682]  Been a little bit of ice on bridges and things, but there's no ice here.
[00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:13.904]  It's just a little bit of water.
[00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:18.307]  Right now the temperature in Austin is 31 degrees.
[00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:22.091]  It'll be above freezing in a couple hours, reportedly.
[00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:29.137]  But as you can see, it looks like during the first days of the lockdown, there's almost no cars on the road.
[00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:37.664]  In the course that we were even up in some place like Dallas, they have more of this happen.
[00:00:38.324 --> 00:00:40.085]  A couple hundred miles south of Dallas.
[00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:45.689]  People know how to drive better on it, or people in the Midwest or people in Canada are really good at driving on it.
[00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.432]  But it just shows how most people don't have any familiarity with the freezing rain that are from Texas.
[00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:52.713]  Or not very often.
[00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:57.636]  So they just stay in whenever they see this.
[00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:06.186]   And I'm not blaming people for doing it, but it just shows How folks are not comfortable with things that they're not familiar with.
[00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:08.846]  That's obviously an understatement.
[00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:14.828]  But, out of so many people, they're saying they're not going into work today.
[00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:19.249]  Because the roads are frozen.
[00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.309]  And they're not.
[00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.430]  And by tomorrow, there won't be any freezing temperatures.
[00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.146]   But I guarantee you, people aren't going to be out even by Friday.
[00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.347]  There won't be ice on trees.
[00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:34.647]  Ice anywhere by Friday morning.
[00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:37.868]  Probably even Thursday afternoon tomorrow.
[00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:39.568]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:40.328]  People won't be out.
[00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:42.849]  See some of the trees that are broken at the top.
[00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:53.511]  This just shows how they can use a virus that was as lethal as the flu to lock society down and also protect from control.
[00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:56.452]  Well at least this ice is somewhat real.
[00:01:57.312 --> 00:02:03.800]   And again coming up here You might actually see a little ice because it is an overpass.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.282]  And again, that's because there's heat trapped in the ground when it was 60 degrees just a couple days ago.
[00:02:09.302 --> 00:02:11.622]  Yeah, there's a little bit of ice here.
[00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:17.484]  So there's heat trapped in the ground that takes days below zero to finally get it cold enough for ice to stick.
[00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:22.965]  Except on overpasses because they're thinner and the heat dissipates quicker.
[00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:32.544]   And I know most of you know that, but for people public school educated like myself, some of us have never Got the learning like I did, at least, about basic physics.
[00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:34.045]  The learning.
[00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:37.888]  And they're just held captive by fear.
[00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:47.796]  Now, I'd imagine when I get up here on top of 290, there might be a little bit more ice.
[00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:50.558]  Yeah, you can see they salted the road right here.
[00:02:50.578 --> 00:02:53.621]  Put on some sands.
[00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.481]  So that's a rubber pass.
[00:02:55.481 --> 00:03:04.481]   And what I want to do more with this new show I'm going to launch is more of a podcast format
[00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:09.481]   with guests and basically commercial-free PowerPoint analysis.
[00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:19.481]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:21.094]  But I'm also going to have just videos I just shoot out about me, my observations, and people that find it informative or interesting can, you know, obviously, use the information, share the information.
[00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:23.855]  And I know for most of our regular listeners, you know all this.
[00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.356]  You're like, why are you talking to us like we're five years old?
[00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:29.278]  Well, that's because you're already informed and know just basic stuff.
[00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:32.162]  Like the average leftist.
[00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:34.403]  It's extremely urban.
[00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:36.284]  They've never been out of a high-rise building.
[00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:38.065]  They don't understand how guns work.
[00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:49.291]  It's like that vice story where they capture El Chapo's son and somebody stuck a 5.56 or .223 casing with the bullet through the bullet hole, saying, look, this bullet's sticking through a hole.
[00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:50.551]  Well, it wasn't a bullet.
[00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:52.112]  It was a whole cartridge in the projectile.
[00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:58.516]  Anybody that knows about any basis of guns saw that, but the whole vice crew, all of them, that went by editors, everything.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.923]  Because they're so disconnected from reality, they don't even know what an actual bullet that's shot through metal looks like.
[00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:09.948]  In fact, when I get to the office, I'll show you what bullets instead of hit metal actually look like.
[00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:16.413]  Now this is a little more dangerous right here, because I'm over here in this fast lane that people haven't been in.
[00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:21.457]  There's actually some ice here, so I'm going to go ahead and move over here.
[00:04:24.704 --> 00:04:40.231]  Again, the key for funs to driving in this, and I'm no expert, I've definitely grown a minute more in Dallas, is keep your wheels pointed straight, don't apply the brakes, slip very lightly if you have to, and drive in the grooves, and obviously reduce your speed.
[00:04:41.811 --> 00:04:56.264]   We'd go weeks when I was a kid in Dallas, it was black ice, and you'd have to drive in the grooves that were just as big as the tire, and then it would re-rain and cover those back up, and it was all for the most bull to go out and We're traveling again and open it up.
[00:04:57.224 --> 00:04:58.465]  We're off the overpass now.
[00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.206]  That was raised back there.
[00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:02.287]  This is concrete built on the ground.
[00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:04.408]  So there's a lot of heat soaked up in the ground.
[00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:06.950]  So that's why this is having ice.
[00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.111]  We're coming up here a little bit later.
[00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:17.856]  When I go back over an overpass here, it'll be icy again.
[00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:24.019]  And if we look at the navigation, for Waze or however you want to look at it, coming up parts of I-35 are closed.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.661]  So I've got to go down some side roads.
[00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:28.242]  They're taking out 35.
[00:05:28.282 --> 00:05:35.008]  But I'll shoot a quick video at the office to tag onto this of the YouTube award that we shot up.
[00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:37.590]  Give you an idea of what bullets actually do when they hit metal.
[00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:39.612]  Different types of metal.
[00:05:40.653 --> 00:05:42.735]  It's actually a fascinating thing dealing with ballistics and things.
[00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:45.137]  Alright.
[00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:49.501]  AlexJonesLive.com AlexJonesLive.com More coming up.
[00:05:52.879 --> 00:06:06.227]  Alright, so here we are at the Infowar Studios and I'm about to show you this plaque and then hey, I'll meet with you in a second.
[00:06:06.247 --> 00:06:06.527]  You there?
[00:06:07.447 --> 00:06:07.948]  Don't run off.
[00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:10.089]  Just ran into one of my crew members.
[00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.550]  And I was talking about this.
[00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:16.413]  This is that award I got many years ago from YouTube when we hit a million subscribers.
[00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:20.589]   And we were shooting this with Pretty decent caliber rifles.
[00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.130]  But it wasn't going through whatever this alloy is.
[00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.030]  It is about a half inch or more thick.
[00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:35.532]  So we started shooting it with like .308s and Creedmoors and stuff that are a little bit, I guess, faster bullets that were gonna go right through.
[00:06:36.293 --> 00:06:41.814]  But you can see the casings of the bullets being torn off and then the lead would still go through.
[00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:45.815]  That's what a bullet looks like when it goes through something.
[00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:51.591]   It doesn't look Like the entire bullet and the bullet casing sticking out.
[00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:53.231]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:06:53.891 --> 00:07:04.374]  The idea that Vice would think that people would buy that, or that the Vice people were so domesticated, so disconnected from reality, that they thought an entire casing was shot out of a gun.
[00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:08.835]  I can reach down here and pick up some of these pieces and show you, but you can see them right there.
[00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:10.916]  So that was the point I was going to make.
[00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:13.216]  So we're going to add this to the piece.
[00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:16.457]  Again, more and more of these are going to be at AlexJonesLive.com.
[00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:18.675]  Just my muses.
[00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:19.695]  Hey, you're lucky.
[00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:21.756]  You don't have to look at my face in these where I shoot it myself.
[00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:24.538]  I could have Rob here shooting a video of it.
[00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.659]  No, no, no.
[00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.781]  This video is on alexjoneslive.com too.
[00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:31.202]  Of you shooting holes in the golden button.
[00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:34.264]  We hadn't released that, but now it's been released on Alex Jones.
[00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:37.033]  Live.com. Right now the site's completely free.
[00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.033]  In a week or two it's going to be updated.
[00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:42.033]  Really, really fancy system for subscribers.
[00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:44.033]  There's also going to be a big free section.
[00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:46.033]   Because we're always about that. People have been asking for a subscription section.
[00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.033]  So there you go.
[00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:50.033]  This is not InfoWars though. This is Alex Jones Live.com.
[00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:52.033]  An entirely different new operation.
[00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:54.033]  And there's a bunch of other stuff in the works as well.
[00:07:54.033 --> 00:08:01.033]  Okay, it's entering day three of the so-called ice storm.
[00:08:01.185 --> 00:08:11.007]  It's wreaking havoc on the trees because a light mist came down and built up huge icicles on the trees, weighing them down.
[00:08:11.868 --> 00:08:13.228]  Massive collapse of trees.
[00:08:13.288 --> 00:08:16.609]  Very, very sad, but just part of the way nature works.
[00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:21.550]  If you look down in there, you can see how many of those trees have just collapsed.
[00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:24.391]  Large pieces of them have collapsed.
[00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:26.212]  In some cases, whole trees.
[00:08:28.103 --> 00:08:30.444]  Now, you notice I'm driving 60 miles an hour.
[00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:32.986]  Speed limit is 65.
[00:08:34.187 --> 00:08:36.108]  There is a little bit of water on the road, that's it.
[00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:38.890]  A little bit of ice on the grass.
[00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.932]  And even on the overpasses, there's no ice there.
[00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:52.138]  There might be a little in the corner of the... ...embankment.
[00:08:53.819 --> 00:09:00.007]   The reason I point this out is, The average person out here that I ran into driven past went about 20 miles an hour.
[00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:02.927]  They're doing stuff like slamming their brakes on.
[00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:10.288]  And I'm not criticizing people, but it's similar to folks that do what I'm doing.
[00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:14.569]  When there's heavy traffic, they go slow in the fast lane.
[00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.050]  I want to put out a t-shirt saying the left lane is for passing.
[00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:40.398]   And the reason I'm making a big deal about this Is whenever I see somebody driving in the fast lane, slow, sometimes 20 miles, well beneath the speed limit, even when it's not bad weather conditions, they almost always have a Bernie Sanders or Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden sticker on.
[00:09:40.878 --> 00:09:44.340]  They've certainly got leftist stickers on their cars most of the times.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.542]  And everybody notices it and statistics show it.
[00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:50.965]  Leftists around the world are the most urbanized people.
[00:09:52.264 --> 00:09:53.284]  Because they're not practical.
[00:09:53.324 --> 00:09:54.205]  They're not near the land.
[00:09:54.225 --> 00:09:55.765]  They don't even know how basic stuff works.
[00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:59.166]  I don't claim to be some engineer mastermind, but I know where electricity comes from.
[00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:00.066]  I know how it's generated.
[00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:01.927]  I know the different types of it.
[00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:15.550]  They don't know that windmills don't even generate enough power in their lifetime to pay for the amount of carbon it took to build the windmills, to ship them out there, and to maintain them.
[00:10:16.571 --> 00:10:17.851]  It's beyond a pure boondoggle.
[00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:21.308]  They don't understand basic information.
[00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:31.975]  And as Thomas Jefferson noted to us in a lot of his writings, that he thought we didn't need lawyers or politician types as our leaders.
[00:10:32.616 --> 00:10:36.559]  We needed the yeoman farmers, which means independent farmers.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:48.448]  Because he recognized that they were the most down to earth in understanding of just general knowledge and saw right through propaganda.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.500]  And promoted freedom.
[00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:56.882]  And so he saw the people in the countryside as better than as, again, we see them today.
[00:10:56.902 --> 00:10:59.583]  Now, there's been a brain drain out of the countryside.
[00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:07.886]  Back when Thomas Jefferson was... signed the Declaration of Independence, and later when he was president, over 90% of the people lived in the country.
[00:11:09.226 --> 00:11:16.969]  So there has been a brain drain out of the country, to the cities, but we're starting to see a lot of the smartest people, the most hardworking people, the most...
[00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:28.739]  Creative people leave and go back to the countryside because the cities have become these crime-ridden terror holes.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:40.208]  As I said yesterday when I was driving, the average leftist doesn't know how to fix a car, doesn't know how to change a tire, doesn't know how to use a gun, doesn't know how to fight.
[00:11:41.109 --> 00:11:46.434]  But statistically, in major studies, depending on what study you look at, there's an overpass noise.
[00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:51.169]  They are between five and ten times being able to study.
[00:11:52.149 --> 00:12:00.231]  More likely to steal, more likely to lie, more likely to virtue settle the claim they're giving to charity, but they don't.
[00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:16.096]  And it's because they really are just NPCs in many ways that just reflect what they think everybody wants to see and are basically followers.
[00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:17.837]  That's what the left is.
[00:12:17.857 --> 00:12:18.957]  They're corporately supported.
[00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:20.858]  They're supported by all the establishments.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:30.305]  They are the anti-avant-garde, the anti-revolutionary, the anti-intellectual, the anti-rebel.
[00:12:30.925 --> 00:12:34.387]  They are the minions that fell for the establishment scam.
[00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:35.008]  See here?
[00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:35.588]  No ice.
[00:12:35.608 --> 00:12:38.730]  A little bit of ice over there on the side.
[00:12:39.631 --> 00:12:44.394]  And it'll be gone, they're saying, by about 4 o'clock today because the temp goes up to about 40 degrees.
[00:12:45.074 --> 00:12:51.452]   But I guarantee you, There'll be lots of this driving 25, 30 miles an hour business.
[00:12:52.393 --> 00:12:53.213]  With flashers on.
[00:12:53.353 --> 00:12:54.695]  And look, we got one right here.
[00:12:56.456 --> 00:12:57.317]  In the fast lane.
[00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:00.880]  In the fast lane.
[00:13:02.762 --> 00:13:05.684]  Driving about 30 miles an hour on a 70.
[00:13:05.925 --> 00:13:08.967]  And again, I would go above 60 in this bad weather.
[00:13:08.987 --> 00:13:11.650]  Now, they don't have any stickers on their car.
[00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:17.501]  No stickers, but let's see if we see any signs of lip tartin'.
[00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:23.607]  So, we just continue on.
[00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:27.610]  Now, these folks think the fast lane is for driving slow.
[00:13:28.011 --> 00:13:29.011]  No, that's the left lane.
[00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:30.733]  I mean, that's the right lane.
[00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:34.196]  And the shoulder used to be for horses.
[00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:35.397]  It still is, under law.
[00:13:36.118 --> 00:13:38.760]  So, the right lane is for going slow.
[00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:40.242]  The...
[00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:42.842]  Left lane is for passing.
[00:13:42.882 --> 00:13:46.886]  I know our viewers know that, but we need to educate these folks on that.
[00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:49.209]  So now I'm going about 70.
[00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:53.653]  As you can see, no ice, no nothing.
[00:13:54.694 --> 00:14:04.524]  I bet you money when I'm driving home today at 5 or 6 that people will still be acting like it's in the work.
[00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:11.340]  I love my crew, but I bet money some of them aren't there today because they just believe the news.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.821]  I mean, everybody falls for propaganda.
[00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:13.902]  I'm not perfect either.
[00:14:13.922 --> 00:14:25.306]  Alright, I said yesterday I'd shoot video of the YouTube Award to show you what bullets really do versus the vice piece.
[00:14:27.647 --> 00:14:29.828]  And again, I know you guys all know that I'm not insulting your intelligence.
[00:14:29.848 --> 00:14:36.731]  I'm just trying to talk about the left and how domesticated they are and how just unaware of how things work they are.
[00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:40.730]  It's like they just go, it's the science, the shots all worked, they're perfect.
[00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:49.522]  It doesn't matter that all the science is out, all the insurance actuaries, that one shot lowers your immune system and increases your chances of dying that year by 7%.
[00:14:49.662 --> 00:14:53.928]  You took the five shots, 35%, major insurance actuaries.
[00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.691]  And there's all the advisories coming out of that.
[00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:01.892]  They had to get rid of three FDA boards because they wouldn't go along with these shots.
[00:15:02.613 --> 00:15:03.813]  They wouldn't go along with giving them to kids.
[00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:04.393]  They just go, no!
[00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:05.494]  All the scientists agree!
[00:15:05.674 --> 00:15:06.174]  They all love it!
[00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:07.295]  It was perfectly fine!
[00:15:07.475 --> 00:15:08.295]  And it was all tested!
[00:15:08.615 --> 00:15:14.518]  Uh, no, it wasn't tested, and then they had to get rid of three FDA main boards until they got a final board that would go along with it.
[00:15:14.758 --> 00:15:17.539]  And now those people are going out in public and saying they did the wrong thing.
[00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:19.040]  But still, science!
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:19.840]  Science!
[00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:24.282]  Science is questioning.
[00:15:26.035 --> 00:15:31.278]  Alright, again, I'm going to upload this to AlexJonesLive.com.
[00:15:32.338 --> 00:15:34.439]  And my little driving around rant's not for everybody.
[00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:42.603]  I know most of our listeners and viewers are more advanced in this knowledge than even I am, but we've got to reach out to those that don't know.
[00:15:42.623 --> 00:15:49.347]  The left's real mad today that a 40-year-old Mr. Rogers film is out.
[00:15:50.765 --> 00:15:53.586]  He's recirculating where he goes, there are boys and there are girls.
[00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:56.347]  They even deleted the Bill Nye Science God thing from the 90s.
[00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:58.768]  He talks about X's and Y's, boys and girls.
[00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:00.349]  I mean, this is a cult, folks.
[00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:01.349]  They call it science.
[00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.231]  And they say that there aren't X and Y chromosomes.
[00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:08.473]  They want a cult of mindless followers, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:09.253]  Alex Jones Live.
