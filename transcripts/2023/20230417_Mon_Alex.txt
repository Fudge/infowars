[00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.952]  It's Monday, April 17th, 2023.
[00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:12.333]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.094]  Not under humble circumstances.
[00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:17.434]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.195]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.685]  Well, there's no doubt that Elon Musk has turned the corner and is fighting for humanity.
[00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:33.590]  Remember, Darth Vader flew through Emperor Palpatine down the mineshaft in fiction.
[00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.333]  Saul of Tarsus in the real world became the biggest champion of Christians.
[00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:45.261]  I'm not saying I totally trust him yet, but he said, arrest anyone sterilizing children, which is the common sense answer, but more hardcore than Trump.
[00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:57.725]  He has come out and exposed what I told you about six, seven years ago, because I talked to people that were in Twitter, and they were explaining that they're reading everybody's private messages, including business messages, you name it.
[00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:01.449]  And the next big shooter drop is that they were selling the data to corporations.
[00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.312]  Can you imagine the corporate level of espionage?
[00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:06.394]  Well, Elon Musk has the code and the documents.
[00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:07.015]  He stopped it.
[00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:27.277]  But the employees at Twitter, thousands of them had access, and think tanks, groups like the ADL, had access reportedly through them, as well as more than 20 government agencies, reading everything you privately send your wife, your boss, your employees, your business partners.
[00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:33.721]  I mean, it's just criminal upon criminal upon criminal, and it's happening in all the big tech companies.
[00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.242]  We only know about this because of Elon Musk.
[00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.726]  Tonight, the Tucker Carlson interview will air.
[00:01:38.726 --> 00:01:42.350]  You better bet your bottom dollar I'll be watching and airing excerpts tomorrow.
[00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.815]  But these two excerpts are sneak peeks with Elon Musk dropping thermonuclear bombs of truth.
[00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:57.403]  The degree to which various government agencies had effectively had full access to everything that was going on on Twitter blew my mind.
[00:01:57.403 --> 00:01:58.624]  I was not aware of that.
[00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:01.747]  Would that include people's DMs?
[00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:01.947]  Yes.
[00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.148]  What's happening is they're training the AI to lie.
[00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:05.868]  Yes!
[00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:06.368]  It's bad.
[00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:07.129]  To lie.
[00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.289]  That's exactly right.
[00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.470]  And to withhold information.
[00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:21.034]  To lie and, yes, comment on some things, not comment on other things, but not to say what the data actually demands that it say.
[00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:22.494]  How did it get this way?
[00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:24.315]  You funded it at the beginning.
[00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:25.055]  What happened?
[00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:26.476]  Yeah, well that would be ironic.
[00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:29.117]  But faith, the most ironic outcome, is most likely it seems.
[00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:39.024]  It's all coming out.
[00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:49.795]  Now, we're going to hit this today, but first, when we come back, when I first saw them say this 20 years ago, I talked about it on air, it was in Globalist, why people didn't believe me.
[00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:54.660]  Then 10 years ago, they did a push and I got a stack of the insane headlines to ban trees.
[00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:57.432]  And to ban plants.
[00:02:57.432 --> 00:03:00.375]  Shame, because they put off carbon dioxide at night.
[00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.337]  They put off oxygen during the day.
[00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:04.919]  That carbon dioxide is a pollutant and is toxic.
[00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.723]  Who else puts off carbon dioxide?
[00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:10.684]  You?
[00:03:10.684 --> 00:03:11.684]  Me?
[00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:13.186]  All of us?
[00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.146]  You are the target.
[00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:16.729]  You are the carbon they want to control.
[00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.529]  That's the plan.
[00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.030]  That blew up in their face.
[00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.291]  Even the dumbest liberal was like, wait, plants aren't bad.
[00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.593]  Plants are good.
[00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:30.994]  And so they backed off.
[00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:36.477]  It had been quiet for the last few years, but they have returned.
[00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:45.302]  They know how to pick one thing because people don't really think of rice as plants, though it's big plants that grow in marshes and swamps.
[00:03:46.673 --> 00:03:51.277]  And so they've picked rice, and now the UN says ban rice.
[00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:52.838]  Oh my gosh!
[00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:56.441]  By the way, this would kill about 4 billion people.
[00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:00.964]  The Food and Agriculture Organization notes that rice is one of the most important simple foods in the world.
[00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:07.669]  Over 50% of the world's population depends on rice for 80% of its food requirements.
[00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.852]  And if they ban rice, it's estimated 5 billion people would die.
[00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.051]  Think about that.
[00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:27.236]  Now, yesterday I aired an incredible 24-minute short animated film that I think is some of the most important work ever done that must go megaviral.
[00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:28.376]  It's titled Beyond the Reset.
[00:04:28.376 --> 00:04:31.858]  We'll post it back to the main page under the live show feed and then fullwords.com.
[00:04:31.858 --> 00:04:36.581]  But in that, the filmmakers made comments after they posted that people kept saying it's not true.
[00:04:37.594 --> 00:04:39.636]  Plants don't release CO2.
[00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:40.477]  But no, they do.
[00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:41.579]  And the government says cut them down.
[00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:42.720]  The globalists do.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.882]  So I thought I'd show you the evidence of that.
[00:04:44.882 --> 00:04:48.687]  But in the film, it shows them deforesting things, which is the actual plan.
[00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:51.009]  They want all plants eradicated.
[00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.150]  Which would kill the planet.
[00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.051]  But it's liberal.
[00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:53.912]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:54.453]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.453 --> 00:04:55.134]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:55.995]  Tomorrow's news is this.
[00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:06.061]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:08.223]  We made it even stronger.
[00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:11.965]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:17.109]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:24.954]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:26.355]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:40.102]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:05:40.102 --> 00:05:42.103]  It is the super fuel.
[00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:43.563]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:44.424]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:45.384]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:05:45.384 --> 00:05:46.565]  They go good with this.
[00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:48.586]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:50.807]  This is the Boss.
[00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:51.549]  TurboForce.
[00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:52.571]  Back in stock.
[00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.592]  Discounted.
[00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:55.296]  M4Store.com.
[00:05:55.296 --> 00:05:56.178]  More power.
[00:05:56.178 --> 00:05:57.179]  More strength.
[00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:57.680]  More energy.
[00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:12.678]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:14.478]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:16.359]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:18.060]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.741]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:24.423]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:36.848]  Show led by the Netherlands, Australia, and more than 50 other countries, and put a cap by the year 2030, that's only six and a half years away, roughly, that
[00:06:39.072 --> 00:06:44.037]  90% of the cows must be butchered and then only 10% of the beef supply will be allowed.
[00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:53.907]  The minister that passed the law in the Netherlands and was driven from office last year was promoted to the head food program at the United Nations.
[00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:05.321]  Well, now they're saying trees must be cut down and rice production must be ended because rice is grown in swamp water.
[00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:13.403]  Everybody knows that swamps put off methane, which is the key part of our atmosphere, holding the atmosphere in.
[00:07:13.403 --> 00:07:15.263]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to explain something.
[00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:19.064]  I've analyzed the enemy attack profile for 30 plus years, 29 on air.
[00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:36.081]  And when I look at it, and everything they're doing with the geoengineering and the genetic engineering and all of it, it's an attempted overthrow of the current biosphere life cycle system on the planet.
[00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.522]  And it's being replaced with a silicon system.
[00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:40.984]  So they've declared war on carbon.
[00:07:40.984 --> 00:07:47.567]  And there's a popular meme, here's one version of it, with a woman having a cup of coffee and she says, you are the carbon
[00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:50.194]  They want to reduce.
[00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:52.195]  So I'm going to be explaining that today.
[00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:54.558]  But if you're a new listener, this is not a joke.
[00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:56.239]  It's not the Babylon Bee.
[00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.902]  This is French news agency AFP.
[00:07:58.902 --> 00:08:08.010]  Rice is now killing the planet and must be banned despite the fact that 50% of the world population depends on it for 80% of their diet.
[00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.754]  It's estimated that would kill around 5 billion people if rice was completely eliminated.
[00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:15.965]  Now you're starting to figure out what's going on.
[00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:17.008]  And I know the listeners get it.
[00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:19.775]  You have to understand, we're not in beta anymore.
[00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:22.160]  We're in operational New World Order.
[00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:31.092]  So I'm going to be going over all of that, and then Elon Musk coming out and saying, look, Twitter's illegally spying on you with government agencies.
[00:08:31.092 --> 00:08:33.873]  They're reading your DMs.
[00:08:33.873 --> 00:08:35.793]  They're giving it to private corporations.
[00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:36.533]  They're sharing it.
[00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:39.054]  It's economic, cultural espionage.
[00:08:39.054 --> 00:08:40.374]  It's election meddling.
[00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:43.514]  It's a criminal, big tech, globalist coup.
[00:08:43.514 --> 00:08:53.176]  And Elon Musk is exposing it while he comes out Friday and says, sterilize a child before they are consenting adult, and you should go to prison for life.
[00:08:54.127 --> 00:08:56.369]  Bingo, baby!
[00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.671]  That's the type of devastating truth we need from major leaders.
[00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:11.979]  So, I judge the tree by its fruits, and Elon Musk has gone from doing 30%, 40% good, to like 90% good, and is radically fighting the New World Order.
[00:09:11.979 --> 00:09:12.900]  That's all coming up.
[00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:19.228]  Also, California rolls out fixed-rate electric bills based on how much you earn.
[00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:21.290]  That is the universal basic income.
[00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.032]  Grocery stores are already rolling out the social credit score apps.
[00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:35.140]  We have key reports here dealing with the 9-11 hijackers and declassified documents for CIA agents.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.282]  It actually came out at the time, but now it's documented.
[00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:40.892]  There is just so much we're going to be going over today.
[00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:48.934]  Commercial real estate is the bulk constrictor that will crush the economy and force the Fed to restart quantitative easing.
[00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:55.035]  Suddenly Washington DC is worried about who, why China has too much power and why we're too dependent on China.
[00:09:55.035 --> 00:10:00.897]  100 plus nations to simultaneously pull out of the dollar system.
[00:10:00.897 --> 00:10:04.398]  It's all going down right now.
[00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.305]  And the people that have hijacked our government are doing it by design.
[00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:10.608]  They are at war with us.
[00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:24.828]  Their plan is to slowly bankrupt you, make you dependent, put you on universal basic income, and then make you live in 15-minute concentration camp training facilities, which are like a minimum security prison.
[00:10:24.828 --> 00:10:30.189]  Then you'll be transferred to a maximum security death camp, where you will be murdered.
[00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:34.510]  You will die alone in a jail cell, executed by a robot.
[00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.670]  Now that's their official plan.
[00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.410]  I don't say that to be shocking.
[00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.571]  On my soul, that is what I know they're doing, 100%.
[00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:46.274]  And I don't like to tempt God, and I'm not tempting God, but so you know I'm serious.
[00:10:46.274 --> 00:10:49.776]  If I am lying to you or exaggerating, may God strike me down.
[00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:51.717]  I am not lying to you.
[00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:53.038]  I am not exaggerating.
[00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:56.881]  They're gonna murder everybody!
[00:10:56.881 --> 00:11:00.163]  You understand what cutting the rice off will do?
[00:11:00.163 --> 00:11:01.384]  They're doing it!
[00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:05.786]  They're a damn death cult!
[00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:09.849]  And there are all these sellouts that sit there and go along with it.
[00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:21.500]  They're all these sickos that sit there and pretend they're part of the power structure.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.663]  But look at it as consecutive rings.
[00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.364]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:32.649]  Here's the ruling globalist class, one-tenth of one percent, and that's expanding more than this.
[00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:37.614]  There's a few thousand globalists, a few hundred controllers out of eight billion people.
[00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:41.257]  So guys, divide two thousand into eight billion, please.
[00:11:42.338 --> 00:11:55.923]  So there is the ruling globalist satanic group working with the principalities of the air, the off-world creature known as Satan that God warned us about, that's going to carry out this plan 2,000 years ago we were given the warning.
[00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:59.565]  That's the rulers, controllers, that's the collaborators that know what's going on.
[00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:10.829]  Then you have consecutive rings of the management class and their minions and the enforcers and the worker class and the military and all of it and the general public out here.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:31.194]  As they attack each outer ring, these structures, from pressure from above and below, in social engineering, once they take out this ring, this ring that helped take out that ring, is taken out.
[00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:38.861]  Until everybody gets taken out, right down to that group, who believes they've got a deal to live forever and merge the machines and be God.
[00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:40.042]  That's the transhumanist cult.
[00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:45.672]  So they've done the math there.
[00:12:45.672 --> 00:12:49.475]  2,000 divided into 8 billion.
[00:12:49.475 --> 00:12:57.922]  When I said one-tenth of one percent, you can see one-tenth of one percent is a much larger number than the one you see on screen.
[00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:09.152]  So, a couple thousand globalists, a few hundred master controllers, and they get each ring to attack down the pyramid.
[00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:11.614]  That's all these consecutive rings is a pyramid from the top.
[00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:15.079]  And they end up taking everybody out in the process.
[00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:21.843]  And they finance reparations and Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the Outer Rings.
[00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.405]  Kind of the homeless drug addict population.
[00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:28.187]  They attack the ring above them, the shopkeepers, the businesses.
[00:13:28.187 --> 00:13:31.990]  And then again, it just collapses, collapses, collapses, collapses up.
[00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.292]  So we're going to be talking about all of that today.
[00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:38.654]  But you have to understand, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:51.819]  That the IQ tests they've put out here, with the call to ban plants, starting with rice, because it's grown in swamp water.
[00:13:51.819 --> 00:13:54.081]  It's always been grown in swamp water.
[00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:55.002]  Swamps are good.
[00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.403]  Swamps are full of life.
[00:13:56.403 --> 00:14:00.166]  Methane is a powerful gas that holds the atmosphere in.
[00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:10.106]  Scientists believe, and evidence is mounting, that Mars, which they've now discovered massive amounts of water on, under the surface, was once lush and green.
[00:14:10.106 --> 00:14:12.927]  Was once covered with water, guaranteed.
[00:14:12.927 --> 00:14:19.810]  But it lost its atmosphere, because the planet is much smaller than Earth, and has less gravity.
[00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:29.094]  And over time, after the planet cooled, which was putting out a lot of different gases, those gases off-gassed, and Mars became dead.
[00:14:32.361 --> 00:14:40.103]  So the idea that you can't grow rice because rice is grown in swamp water, that swamp water is bad.
[00:14:40.103 --> 00:14:42.483]  There's always been cows, there's always been bovine.
[00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:45.144]  Cows are just bred forms of buffalo, water buffalo.
[00:14:45.144 --> 00:14:46.304]  It's all the same species.
[00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:50.385]  You can take an African water buffalo and made it with an American bison.
[00:14:50.385 --> 00:14:58.366]  Take an American bison and have babies with Chinese cows, you know, 5,000 year old breeds of cows they got in China.
[00:14:58.366 --> 00:15:00.827]  They're domesticated buffalo.
[00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:06.088]  And they're all over the world, including they used to be in the Arctic.
[00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:15.595]  And so the point is, is that we've always had big herds of these things going around, eating grass and pooping out great fertilizer that helps the grass grow.
[00:15:15.595 --> 00:15:20.859]  Anybody who's ever worked on a farm or a ranch knows, where the cows go to the bathroom, it's like natural fertilizer.
[00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:26.984]  That's why farmers scoop it up and go put it on the tomato plants and the wheat crops, because it's good!
[00:15:26.984 --> 00:15:27.804]  It's good!
[00:15:27.804 --> 00:15:29.585]  The cows are good!
[00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:31.127]  Good cow, good moo-moo!
[00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:36.741]  But the left can be convinced to get rid of it because eating meat's mean first, and then, well, it's for the environment.
[00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:39.063]  What about rice, dumbass?
[00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.906]  They'll line up and give that up, too, and tell them, only the crickets are good for you.
[00:15:41.906 --> 00:15:46.510]  When we come back, we'll explain the master plan, because now suddenly they're back, all over the news.
[00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.511]  It's time to cut down the forest.
[00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:50.513]  Scientists believed the rainforest was important.
[00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:52.555]  Now they believe it's greedy and bad.
[00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:54.677]  No, they actually called it greedy.
[00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:55.878]  And it needs to be cut down.
[00:15:55.878 --> 00:15:56.899]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:06.545]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:08.468]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.990]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.754]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:14.797]  And it says political prisoner.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.542]  With an image of President Trump.
[00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:19.984]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:16:19.984 --> 00:16:22.125]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:27.510]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.711]  Jail background.
[00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:29.772]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:16:29.772 --> 00:16:33.895]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:35.496]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:36.517]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:39.079]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:39.840]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.721]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:44.263]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[00:16:44.263 --> 00:16:46.144]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:55.390]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:31.190]  And I'm just going to tell you, bottom line, my wife is blown away.
[00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:38.619]  I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the sheets and I'm telling you, at 49, I've got more energy
[00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:41.642]  In that department that I had when I was 18.
[00:17:41.642 --> 00:17:46.228]  And I owe it all to 1776 Testosterone Boost.

[00:17:59.815 --> 00:18:08.021]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[00:18:08.021 --> 00:18:09.462]  That is a hellish future.
[00:18:09.462 --> 00:18:17.988]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowars.com.
[00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:24.451]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:27.052]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[00:18:27.052 --> 00:18:32.415]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:36.356]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:42.259]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:44.320]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.501]  This is their big move.
[00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:50.083]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:50.603]  He doesn't care.
[00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:12.286]  That's not his job.
[00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:14.028]  He's not the President of the United States.
[00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:17.893]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:19:17.893 --> 00:19:22.398]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:19:22.398 --> 00:19:23.500]  They must be opposed.
[00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:27.549]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:28.730]  No.
[00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.570]  No.
[00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.331]  No.
[00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:31.231]  Exactly.
[00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:34.793]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:19:34.793 --> 00:19:37.895]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:19:37.895 --> 00:19:40.377]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:19:40.377 --> 00:19:42.878]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:19:42.878 --> 00:19:46.500]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.022]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:49.422]  You're right.
[00:19:49.702 --> 00:19:54.447]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[00:19:54.447 --> 00:20:01.474]  And we say no to your war!
[00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:06.079]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.536 --> 00:20:34.678]  Holy Diver!
[00:20:34.678 --> 00:20:36.259]  Holy Diver!
[00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:39.760]  You've been down too long in the midnight sea.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.841]  Almost becoming a me.
[00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:42.481]  Ride the tiger!
[00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:49.305]  You can see his stripes, but you know he's clean.
[00:20:49.305 --> 00:20:53.406]  Oh, don't you see what I mean?
[00:20:53.406 --> 00:20:54.107]  Gotta get away!
[00:21:05.148 --> 00:21:22.062]  Here's the most important part of the song.
[00:21:32.678 --> 00:21:42.248]  Between the velvet lies, there's a truth as hard as steel.
[00:21:42.248 --> 00:21:48.233]  The vision never dies.
[00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:49.675]  They will not stop humanity.
[00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:52.958]  We will populate the stars and beyond.
[00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.399]  It is our destiny.
[00:21:57.714 --> 00:22:00.196]  All right, let's move into it right now.
[00:22:00.196 --> 00:22:05.020]  We can pull up countless videos of Extinction Rebellion, funded by British Petroleum, who's involved in all this.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.162]  Yes, the oil companies run the whole plan.
[00:22:07.162 --> 00:22:09.984]  That seems antithetical, but I'll explain in a moment.
[00:22:09.984 --> 00:22:17.830]  To go block trains and cars and attack factories and infrastructure and people, and they've got leftist groups going around blowing up food infrastructure everywhere.
[00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.874]  They're sabotaging with asymmetrical warfare society.
[00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:26.778]  And they've come out and they've announced, we're going to start paying huge
[00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:48.383]  Governmental and corporate subsidies to groups and organizations that set land off use and cut down all the trees and wait for it, build stinking toxic solar panels that are created and made up of giant toxic open-air mines across the planet.
[00:22:48.383 --> 00:22:52.086]  This is a silicon anti-carbon revolution.
[00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:53.988]  You are the carbon.
[00:22:53.988 --> 00:22:54.148]  So,
[00:22:55.276 --> 00:23:01.422]  A decade ago they started coming out and saying we need to ban and restrict and cut down trace.
[00:23:01.422 --> 00:23:02.343]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:23:02.343 --> 00:23:03.284]  The left didn't bite.
[00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:06.007]  Even they knew that was crazy.
[00:23:06.007 --> 00:23:07.128]  So now they went away for a while.
[00:23:07.128 --> 00:23:07.769]  Now they're back.
[00:23:07.769 --> 00:23:12.754]  French news agency, Reuters, it's everywhere, BBC Newscast, everything.
[00:23:12.754 --> 00:23:16.938]  Rice is now killing the planet, apparently, despite the fact that 50% of the planet gets 90% of its
[00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.091]  80% of its food requirement from it.
[00:23:26.091 --> 00:23:29.753]  Now, you're thinking, well, that's just a one-off for the French news agency.
[00:23:29.753 --> 00:23:33.874]  No, I've got newscasts, I've got everything right here.
[00:23:33.874 --> 00:23:43.478]  But in beyond the reset that came out a month ago and had a million, 900,000 views yesterday, I plug it now, it's got like a million and a half, it needs to get 100 million views.
[00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:49.461]  It's up on Infowars.com, the live show feed, in this 24-minute documentary, animated documentary is really what it is.
[00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:54.921]  They have a piece in there where in the near future they're cutting down the rainforest to build solar panels.
[00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.042]  That's an actual real plan.
[00:23:57.042 --> 00:24:06.528]  And some of the commenters didn't believe it, so the filmmakers put scientific links under, as the main post, in the about the video report.
[00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:07.488]  Okay?
[00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:12.832]  But I thought I would actually play a clip from the documentary, near future documentary.
[00:24:13.905 --> 00:24:21.406]  You know, it's technically an animated thing about the future, a dystopian film, but this is really what they're doing.
[00:24:21.406 --> 00:24:29.308]  I thought I would first show you just a small sampling of the enemy media, the globalist anti-human media.
[00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:32.529]  Is planting trees good for the environment?
[00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:35.349]  Is planting trees as good for the environment as everybody says?
[00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:38.430]  Big thick news article telling you get rid of trees.
[00:24:39.326 --> 00:24:40.586]  CNN.
[00:24:40.586 --> 00:24:46.388]  Plant trees, sure, but to save the climate, we should also cut them down.
[00:24:46.388 --> 00:24:47.549]  That's a double thing.
[00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:50.890]  The new plan to remove trillions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
[00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.770]  Bury it.
[00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:52.911]  Washington Post.
[00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:55.332]  Cut down trees.
[00:24:55.332 --> 00:24:57.012]  Bury them.
[00:24:57.012 --> 00:24:58.313]  Climate change.
[00:24:58.313 --> 00:25:00.533]  Planting new forests can do more harm than good.
[00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:04.015]  BBC.
[00:25:04.015 --> 00:25:07.416]  Climate change is turning the trees into gluttons.
[00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:08.036]  Big article.
[00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:14.096]  Calling for the rainforest to be annihilated because it's, quote, greedy.
[00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:14.897]  I'm not joking.
[00:25:14.897 --> 00:25:17.698]  Those greedy, greedy trees.
[00:25:17.698 --> 00:25:25.040]  A stealth effort to bury wood for carbon removal has just raised millions.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.441]  It was back a decade ago.
[00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:27.981]  The biofuel debate.
[00:25:27.981 --> 00:25:29.542]  Will cutting trees cut carbon?
[00:25:29.542 --> 00:25:31.162]  New York Times.
[00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:32.963]  To save forests, cut some trees down.
[00:25:32.963 --> 00:25:37.484]  I mean, that's the doublespeak we got here, okay?
[00:25:37.484 --> 00:25:39.205]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:25:41.761 --> 00:25:43.201]  It's not a joke.
[00:25:43.201 --> 00:25:49.603]  Here's a clip from the documentary, in my words, Beyond the Reset.
[00:25:49.603 --> 00:25:52.363]  Here it is.
[00:25:52.363 --> 00:26:01.165]  As the whole planet went on the righteous crusade against climate change and global warming, we are excited to spread the word about another successful project.
[00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:06.846]  As science tells us, during the night, plants release CO2 into the atmosphere.
[00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:11.407]  CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas that dramatically contributes to global warming.
[00:26:12.435 --> 00:26:14.217]  But don't worry.
[00:26:14.217 --> 00:26:27.028]  Almost 100,000 square miles of South American rainforest has been cleared, and this area is used to construct one of the largest solar panel fields in the world that will provide us with a tremendous amount of clean energy.
[00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:32.633]  We will keep fighting the deadly forests and defeat climate change.
[00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:36.856]  So, millions of people saw the video.
[00:26:38.058 --> 00:26:43.562]  And they got very upset and they said, trees don't put off carbon dioxide and no one wants to hurt trees.
[00:26:43.562 --> 00:26:44.102]  Really?
[00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.703]  Well, okay.
[00:26:45.703 --> 00:26:49.726]  They want to target the specific plants that feed us.
[00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:52.808]  Rice.
[00:26:52.808 --> 00:27:03.034]  And they've built all over the world, in already swampy areas, rice paddies that are concentric rings where they grow it.
[00:27:03.034 --> 00:27:06.897]  And because the swamp water puts off methane, which is part of the earth,
[00:27:07.824 --> 00:27:08.424]  Which is good.
[00:27:08.424 --> 00:27:11.167]  Which is part of our atmosphere.
[00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:12.848]  It's a critical gassy atmosphere.
[00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:17.452]  They want that cut off because it will kill billions of people.
[00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:26.560]  Over 50% of the world's population depends on rice for about 80% of their food requirements.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.605]  95% of global output of rice is produced and consumed in developing countries.
[00:27:32.605 --> 00:27:33.866]  It's a death sentence.
[00:27:35.618 --> 00:27:38.220]  An absolute total death sentence.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:45.444]  But remember, you are the carbon they want to reduce.
[00:27:45.444 --> 00:27:46.285]  And don't forget it.
[00:27:46.285 --> 00:27:49.466]  So let that burn into your brains, folks.
[00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:50.827]  That this is the game.
[00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:52.188]  It's not a joke.
[00:27:52.188 --> 00:27:53.209]  These people mean business.
[00:27:57.543 --> 00:28:06.445]  An electric car, depending on the study you look at, is five to nine times more toxic to produce, and uses more carbon than in a gas or diesel vehicle.
[00:28:06.445 --> 00:28:07.966]  That's all real numbers.
[00:28:07.966 --> 00:28:20.209]  But if you can't get the public to understand that plants are good, and that carbon dioxide's good, they're not going to understand that when they lie up there and tell you, oh, that by the year 2030, 70% of the cars by law must be electric vehicles.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:28.305]  While they cut off all the supply of energy, so there won't be enough energy for the electric cars, and they admit that.
[00:28:28.305 --> 00:28:30.286]  It's a bridge to nowhere.
[00:28:30.286 --> 00:28:45.558]  You've seen those congressional cases, it's happened many times, where a congressman just signs off on a bill, and then they just build a bridge to nowhere, just out in the middle of nowhere, just sticks out in the water, just, you know, his cousin got 20 million dollars, a kickback or whatever.
[00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:47.359]  They want you to think, oh, there's a future.
[00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.361]  No, they're blowing up our infrastructure,
[00:28:50.845 --> 00:28:52.787]  It has nothing to do with saving the Earth.
[00:28:52.787 --> 00:28:55.911]  It's about taking control of us.
[00:28:55.911 --> 00:28:57.393]  This is the war we're all living in.
[00:28:57.393 --> 00:28:57.794]  Stay with us.
[00:29:07.964 --> 00:29:16.690]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.872]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[00:29:18.872 --> 00:29:31.061]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes, and again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and
[00:29:31.281 --> 00:29:32.902]  And everything, krill oil.
[00:29:32.902 --> 00:29:40.687]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:29:40.687 --> 00:29:46.690]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.432]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:29:49.432 --> 00:29:51.613]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:29:51.613 --> 00:29:53.535]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:29:53.535 --> 00:29:56.877]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:29:56.877 --> 00:29:58.918]  You have to have these products.
[00:30:00.805 --> 00:30:03.907]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:06.208]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:30:06.208 --> 00:30:10.150]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.073]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[00:30:15.526 --> 00:30:19.068]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:27.893]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:30:27.893 --> 00:30:30.775]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:30:30.775 --> 00:30:36.459]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:38.260]  I know you spread the word.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.181]  I know you pray for us.
[00:30:39.181 --> 00:30:39.781]  That's wonderful.
[00:30:39.781 --> 00:30:40.342]  Keep doing it.
[00:30:40.342 --> 00:30:49.290]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.594]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:53.594 --> 00:30:58.559]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.320]  Please take action now.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.223]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:31:05.223 --> 00:31:07.904]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:10.526]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:31:10.526 --> 00:31:11.266]  Period.
[00:31:11.266 --> 00:31:12.367]  Case closed.
[00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:13.728]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:31:13.728 --> 00:31:14.208]  We sell.
[00:31:14.728 --> 00:31:22.015]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:29.581]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[00:31:30.382 --> 00:31:34.765]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:31:34.765 --> 00:31:36.066]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:31:36.066 --> 00:31:39.107]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:31:39.107 --> 00:31:44.331]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[00:31:44.331 --> 00:31:49.794]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:31:49.794 --> 00:31:51.455]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:31:51.455 --> 00:31:53.036]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:31:53.036 --> 00:31:54.377]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:31:54.557 --> 00:31:57.218]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:57.218 --> 00:31:58.319]  They're discounted right now.
[00:31:58.319 --> 00:31:59.540]  Finally back in stock.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.261]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:07.123]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:32:07.123 --> 00:32:12.026]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[00:32:12.426 --> 00:32:23.169]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[00:32:23.169 --> 00:32:38.434]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back and Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[00:32:39.314 --> 00:32:43.496]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:19.484 --> 00:33:24.749]  Yes, we're live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:24.749 --> 00:33:26.892]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:26.892 --> 00:33:29.214]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:29.214 --> 00:33:31.676]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:33.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:05.658 --> 00:34:12.441]  Alright, if I don't tie these pieces together, at least to some of the nodes, there's hundreds, I'm doing it as justice.
[00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:14.002]  You can't cover one story about
[00:34:14.764 --> 00:34:23.070]  The UN, the globalists, officially saying get rid of the cows, get rid of the forest, get rid of rice, and not explain just how diabolical that is.
[00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.893]  And I know on the surface it's already diabolical enough, but that's the first inch of it.
[00:34:26.893 --> 00:34:27.974]  It's about a thousand feet deep.
[00:34:27.974 --> 00:34:30.456]  It gets much worse as you go deeper.
[00:34:30.456 --> 00:34:36.881]  You've seen them systematically cut off the police force, disarm people in blue cities, crime rates explode, cities die.
[00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:41.664]  You've seen them demoralize the public, set up bureaucracies and things that target and destroy small businesses.
[00:34:41.664 --> 00:34:42.165]  You witnessed
[00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:52.010]  Years in blue cities and states of lockdowns, not just here but around the world, that destroyed the small businesses and infrastructure.
[00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.152]  This is all, simply put, war.
[00:34:55.152 --> 00:35:09.984]  And they want AI dialed into everything to make it easier to do, but it's already brainiac globalists that are chemists and major scientists and strategists and actuarists that have integrated a plan
[00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:18.612]  That on its face, a first-year business student can say, we'll kill billions.
[00:35:18.612 --> 00:35:25.879]  I mean, you cut off the rice that 50% of the world's population or more lives on, we'll die.
[00:35:25.879 --> 00:35:30.283]  I mean, that's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:35:30.283 --> 00:35:32.205]  And you start cutting down all the trees.
[00:35:33.905 --> 00:35:36.086]  So they don't put off carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[00:35:36.086 --> 00:35:37.487]  That kills the planet.
[00:35:37.487 --> 00:35:56.497]  And as you go each step down this giant cobalt and giant lithium mines and giant nickel mines and just you see the videos of these in African places and there's the biggest hell holes you've ever seen with slave labor and eight-year-old kids hauling this crap out in mudslides and mass death and UN troops with guns controlling it and the Chinese controlling it.
[00:35:58.348 --> 00:36:07.931]  We're living in the biggest dystopia the world's ever seen, and here in the West we've been somewhat shielded, but that's all being erased now.
[00:36:07.931 --> 00:36:11.832]  And God help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:11.832 --> 00:36:12.613]  God help us.
[00:36:12.613 --> 00:36:16.754]  This is pure, absolute, total evil.
[00:36:16.754 --> 00:36:22.716]  And then, all over the Western world, they have children in the public schools, right here in Austin.
[00:36:23.646 --> 00:36:28.910]  During Gay Pride Month, they make them march out with the rainbow flags, the transgender flags, and chant.
[00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.413]  The elementary students, the parents under peer pressure, let them do it.
[00:36:32.413 --> 00:36:35.956]  The little girls carrying the flags, and then they're pressured into saying they're a boy.
[00:36:35.956 --> 00:36:38.357]  Then they get sterilized.
[00:36:38.357 --> 00:36:39.879]  It's all depopulation.
[00:36:39.879 --> 00:36:47.324]  It is so dystopic, and it's not a plan, it's an operation we're living in.
[00:36:47.324 --> 00:36:48.726]  So, let me get back to this.
[00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:49.046]  Tonight,
[00:36:50.953 --> 00:36:54.035]  I'm Tucker Carlson Show at 7 Central, 8 Eastern.
[00:36:54.035 --> 00:36:56.217]  I'll be watching it.
[00:36:56.217 --> 00:36:57.518]  Elon Musk says U.S.
[00:36:57.518 --> 00:36:59.999]  government had access to private Twitter DMs.
[00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:02.581]  It was shared with corporations, shared with government.
[00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:04.082]  That is beyond illegal.
[00:37:04.082 --> 00:37:06.104]  Remember the NSA would deny in Congress?
[00:37:06.104 --> 00:37:08.886]  Clapper years ago, six, seven years ago, eight years ago.
[00:37:08.886 --> 00:37:13.069]  Oh, we've never spied on a single American.
[00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:15.090]  Remember that perjury?
[00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.733]  This is the government interface directly to the private messages.
[00:37:20.762 --> 00:37:28.407]  And then Elon goes on to explain how, even though he's one of the main inventors of the AI they pulled out of five years ago, they're programming it to lie to you.
[00:37:28.407 --> 00:37:31.009]  They're programming it with fraud up front.
[00:37:31.009 --> 00:37:35.011]  Remember Enron, who developed the carbon tax plan and all this in the 80s?
[00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:35.471]  Look it up.
[00:37:35.471 --> 00:37:38.794]  Congressional hearings.
[00:37:38.794 --> 00:37:40.975]  Kinlay.
[00:37:40.975 --> 00:37:43.517]  With Al Gore and others.
[00:37:43.517 --> 00:37:45.198]  Rothschilds funded it.
[00:37:45.198 --> 00:37:50.101]  They had fake computer programs and fake computer rooms in California,
[00:37:51.423 --> 00:37:52.464]  And in New York.
[00:37:52.464 --> 00:37:56.087]  And they would bring members of Congress and legislatures in.
[00:37:56.087 --> 00:37:58.729]  They'd show them the live trading of energy and what was happening.
[00:37:58.729 --> 00:38:02.591]  But really, the bosses would just say, okay, today we're going to claim there's not enough power.
[00:38:02.591 --> 00:38:05.073]  We're going to overcharge Californians $3 billion.
[00:38:05.073 --> 00:38:10.357]  Some days they made $3 billion extra.
[00:38:10.357 --> 00:38:13.940]  Up to the year about 1990.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.221]  91.
[00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:15.781]  There it is.
[00:38:15.781 --> 00:38:17.963]  Enron, Sting, used fake command center.
[00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:18.523]  London Guardian.
[00:38:18.523 --> 00:38:20.265]  You know, back when they actually did their job half the time.
[00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:25.010]  You won't hear a word now because they've been bought out.
[00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.953]  Well, what is it to have AI producing fake reports without even looking?
[00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:31.314]  And here's the good news.
[00:38:31.314 --> 00:38:45.703]  I saw six or seven articles last week out of Florida and New York and Montana of all places and Washington State and even Texas where professors and heads of departments had to resign as statisticians.
[00:38:46.516 --> 00:38:55.844]  Because they've been paid to put out fake reports that racism was super popular and growing and endemic.
[00:38:55.844 --> 00:39:00.008]  But their real study showed the opposite.
[00:39:00.008 --> 00:39:01.670]  But that's what we're talking about.
[00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.011]  Fraud.
[00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:04.312]  Scams.
[00:39:04.312 --> 00:39:05.673]  Lies.
[00:39:05.673 --> 00:39:09.697]  A criminal group who's greenlit all these people to do whatever they want.
[00:39:09.697 --> 00:39:11.098]  But the good news is, still in the year 2023,
[00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:24.378]  I saw at least six or seven examples of professors fired or quitting, resigning last week.
[00:39:24.378 --> 00:39:25.498]  Yeah, there's one of the headlines right there.
[00:39:25.498 --> 00:39:28.941]  Four professor leaves $109,000 a year job following claim.
[00:39:28.941 --> 00:39:30.321]  He faked data on racism.
[00:39:30.321 --> 00:39:31.042]  It's not a claim.
[00:39:31.042 --> 00:39:33.544]  They looked it up.
[00:39:33.544 --> 00:39:35.425]  He said the racism was the worst it ever been.
[00:39:37.298 --> 00:39:38.739]  Well, you mean the left promoting racism?
[00:39:38.739 --> 00:39:43.422]  But people aren't biting a small minority of idiot people of all different colors are biting.
[00:39:43.422 --> 00:39:48.566]  But most people are like, no, you're trying to get us to kill each other while you screw us.
[00:39:48.566 --> 00:39:51.968]  So this is a big deal.
[00:39:51.968 --> 00:40:03.156]  And you just have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that you have to do what I've done and what Elon Musk has done and what Tucker Carlson has done and what others have done.
[00:40:03.156 --> 00:40:06.559]  And understand that this is a criminal takeover.
[00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:10.714]  And you have to match it with its extremism with the truth.
[00:40:10.714 --> 00:40:16.137]  Because I get when something's wild and crazy... You know, before I went on air today, I was going to come on and say, hey, they want to ban trees.
[00:40:16.137 --> 00:40:18.399]  And I went and got you a bunch of articles I'm saying.
[00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:19.679]  And I know it sounds crazy.
[00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:20.800]  It doesn't sound real.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.221]  Like saying two men can have a baby.
[00:40:22.221 --> 00:40:25.523]  Or they're putting convicted pedophiles in prisons.
[00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.964]  James O'Keefe has exposed this again.
[00:40:27.964 --> 00:40:30.466]  All over the country, but particularly the West Coast.
[00:40:30.466 --> 00:40:33.107]  Where they rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape.
[00:40:33.107 --> 00:40:35.969]  And they put a biological man in a jail cell with women.
[00:40:38.513 --> 00:40:41.596]  Now that's hard to believe, but that's going on.
[00:40:41.596 --> 00:40:46.902]  So just because they're so radical and crazy, we can't be like, well we don't want to sound nuts and say they want to kill us.
[00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:52.868]  We don't want to sound nuts and say they're cutting off the economy and resources to collapse society, which they admit they're doing.
[00:40:52.868 --> 00:40:59.755]  You know, you cut off rice that 53% of the world, the actual number's right here, gets 80% of their calories from, they'll die without it.
[00:41:00.922 --> 00:41:03.006]  That is what it is!
[00:41:03.006 --> 00:41:03.728]  It's radical!
[00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:04.590]  It's over the top!
[00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.592]  It's mass murder!
[00:41:05.592 --> 00:41:07.155]  It's genocide!
[00:41:07.155 --> 00:41:08.779]  It's eugenics on steroids!
[00:41:08.779 --> 00:41:11.665]  So yeah, it sounds crazy to say that, but they're the ones doing it!
[00:41:12.509 --> 00:41:20.173]  It's like when I remember 15 years ago, I saw the headline, video, man eats face of another man on bath salts.
[00:41:20.173 --> 00:41:21.654]  And I'm like, that can't be true.
[00:41:21.654 --> 00:41:22.835]  I clicked the video.
[00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:27.317]  It's like a five minute video of him biting his nose off and eating it, biting his lip off and eating it.
[00:41:27.317 --> 00:41:29.819]  You know, you're like, wow, that really, that really happened.
[00:41:29.819 --> 00:41:40.905]  So we as normal people that just want to go eat fajitas and drink a Dos Equis and watch the sunset and never get tired of going for a hike or out on a boat, never get tired of, you know, hanging out with your family.
[00:41:42.267 --> 00:41:45.428]  You hear that and you think, that's not true.
[00:41:45.428 --> 00:41:48.829]  That's because you're not a psychotic demon.
[00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:52.730]  But there's more and more of these people and you've got to admit to yourselves this is happening.
[00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.410]  So here's a couple clips of Elon Musk, previews of what's coming out tonight.
[00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.211]  Bombshell after bombshell with Tucker Carlson.
[00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:07.813]  The degree to which various government agencies had effectively had full access to everything that was going on on Twitter blew my mind.
[00:42:07.813 --> 00:42:09.014]  I was not aware of that.
[00:42:09.014 --> 00:42:10.474]  Would that include people's DMs?
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.201]  Uh, yes.
[00:42:13.201 --> 00:42:15.502]  What's happening is they're training the AI to lie.
[00:42:15.502 --> 00:42:16.223]  Yes.
[00:42:16.223 --> 00:42:16.723]  It's bad.
[00:42:16.723 --> 00:42:17.264]  To lie.
[00:42:17.264 --> 00:42:18.624]  That's exactly right.
[00:42:18.624 --> 00:42:19.845]  And to withhold information.
[00:42:19.845 --> 00:42:31.393]  To lie and, yes, comment on some things, not comment on other things, but not to say what the data actually demands that it say.
[00:42:31.393 --> 00:42:32.193]  How did it get this way?
[00:42:32.193 --> 00:42:34.675]  I thought you funded it at the beginning.
[00:42:34.675 --> 00:42:35.415]  What happened?
[00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:36.856]  Yeah, well, that would be ironic.
[00:42:36.856 --> 00:42:39.478]  But faith, the most ironic outcome, is the most likely, it seems.
[00:42:43.103 --> 00:42:45.865]  Yeah, he said like, we're running out of conspiracy theories.
[00:42:45.865 --> 00:42:47.847]  They're all coming true.
[00:42:47.847 --> 00:42:51.629]  And again, just like Enron had fake computers, this is the next level of that.
[00:42:51.629 --> 00:42:52.910]  Theranos had fake blood tests.
[00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.991]  It was all a fraud.
[00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:54.912]  It's all a fraud.
[00:42:54.912 --> 00:42:55.993]  It's all a lie.
[00:42:55.993 --> 00:42:57.314]  Trees and cows are good.
[00:43:00.066 --> 00:43:05.089]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:07.251]  We made it even stronger.
[00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:10.993]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:43:10.993 --> 00:43:17.678]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:17.678 --> 00:43:23.982]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:43:23.982 --> 00:43:25.383]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:39.147]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:43:39.147 --> 00:43:41.129]  It is the super fuel.
[00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:42.590]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.450]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.411]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:43:44.411 --> 00:43:45.612]  They go good with this.
[00:43:45.612 --> 00:43:47.633]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:43:48.354 --> 00:43:49.838]  This is the Boss.
[00:43:49.838 --> 00:43:50.559]  TurboForce.
[00:43:50.559 --> 00:43:51.582]  Back in stock.

[00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:32.015]  I know what victory looks like.
[00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:34.337]  I know what it smells like.
[00:47:34.337 --> 00:47:36.639]  I know what it tastes like.
[00:47:36.639 --> 00:47:39.562]  And I told you yesterday on the Sunday Show, beyond the reset of 24 minute,
[00:47:40.982 --> 00:47:44.464]  Animated near-future documentary, in my words.
[00:47:44.464 --> 00:47:45.745]  Not technically a documentary.
[00:47:45.745 --> 00:47:46.946]  It's something everybody needs to watch.
[00:47:46.946 --> 00:47:49.767]  It's in the live show feed today at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:50.348]  Get it and share it.
[00:47:50.348 --> 00:47:52.069]  It's not our film.
[00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.870]  It is so important.
[00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:58.353]  It's put out by a group of engineers and folks who have been doing deep research.
[00:47:58.353 --> 00:48:02.115]  I want to play a few clips of where he's in the death camp and figures out he's in a death camp.
[00:48:03.604 --> 00:48:05.506]  Dear Residents of the Quarantine Facility Number 89.
[00:48:26.175 --> 00:48:27.376]  Great news!
[00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:35.801]  Here at Novagene Labs, we grant you a chance to participate in the trials of our new drug, which has been developed by our research team.
[00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:43.426]  This drug is absolutely safe and will bring the end to the deadly virus we are all fighting together for the last several years.
[00:48:43.426 --> 00:48:49.390]  Those of you who chose to participate will get a significant social credit score boost.
[00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.553]  As the result, you will be relocated to a superior isolation facility.
[00:48:54.654 --> 00:48:57.275]  Receive a higher universal basic income.
[00:48:57.275 --> 00:49:16.685]  And of course, in the full clip, at the end it says, it's safe, it's good to take, no one's been hurt by it.
[00:49:16.685 --> 00:49:20.146]  And then it goes, we have no liability for sickness, illness, or death.
[00:49:20.146 --> 00:49:21.127]  Which is what they actually said.
[00:49:22.386 --> 00:49:22.826]  It's safe.
[00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:23.386]  It's effective.
[00:49:23.386 --> 00:49:24.247]  Don't listen to people.
[00:49:24.247 --> 00:49:25.748]  And then, oh, by the way, it can kill you.
[00:49:25.748 --> 00:49:29.409]  The fine print.
[00:49:29.409 --> 00:49:30.690]  So he didn't click on it.
[00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.771]  He didn't decide to get out of the camp.
[00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:35.232]  But his neighbor did.
[00:49:35.232 --> 00:49:38.733]  And see what happens to the neighbor three days later.
[00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:40.234]  Trash truck comes with the robots.
[00:49:40.234 --> 00:49:42.655]  They take his dead body out.
[00:49:42.655 --> 00:49:46.397]  And it gets sent to a processing facility where bugs eat the dead body.
[00:49:46.397 --> 00:49:48.278]  Then you eat the bugs.
[00:49:48.278 --> 00:49:48.818]  Three days later.
[00:49:50.646 --> 00:49:50.806]  2.41 p.m.
[00:49:50.806 --> 00:49:52.767]  He goes out on his tiny balcony.
[00:49:52.767 --> 00:49:57.950]  He's got to wear his mask or the drone will taser him.
[00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:59.051]  What's he see?
[00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:06.335]  Oh, his neighbor's doing quite well.
[00:50:06.335 --> 00:50:10.198]  The drones come out with the body bag.
[00:50:10.198 --> 00:50:10.938]  Mission complete.
[00:50:36.368 --> 00:50:40.090]  And they built these death camps under UN control all over the world.
[00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.051]  I wonder how they'd be able to roll something out like this.
[00:50:43.051 --> 00:50:44.051]  They've done it.
[00:50:44.051 --> 00:50:45.512]  The good news is the world rejected it.
[00:50:45.512 --> 00:50:51.794]  They've had to back off for now, but they're promising another run with a more deadly virus this time that targets children.
[00:50:51.794 --> 00:50:52.535]  So let's look.
[00:50:52.535 --> 00:50:54.596]  They're banning cows, banning rice.
[00:50:54.596 --> 00:50:55.936]  They want to cut down all the trees.
[00:50:55.936 --> 00:50:56.977]  I just showed you all that earlier.
[00:50:56.977 --> 00:50:59.938]  Saying trees are bad because they put off carbon dioxide at night.
[00:50:59.938 --> 00:51:01.579]  They mainly put off oxygen.
[00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:03.880]  But they've said anything that puts off carbon dioxide is evil.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.460]  It must be banned.
[00:51:06.573 --> 00:51:09.794]  What do you exhale?
[00:51:09.794 --> 00:51:12.436]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:13.916]  Europe's energy troubles continue.
[00:51:13.916 --> 00:51:16.217]  Hydro and nuclear output declining.
[00:51:16.217 --> 00:51:23.000]  They're not repairing or upkeeping their nuclear power plants, and they're shutting many of them down, as well as dams.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.282]  But they're banning coal.
[00:51:27.282 --> 00:51:28.743]  How are you going to charge your EVs?
[00:51:28.743 --> 00:51:30.484]  The answer is you're not.
[00:51:30.484 --> 00:51:32.785]  PETA says it's human beings.
[00:51:34.127 --> 00:51:37.671]  Disgusting behavior that's led to rat population explosion in New York City.
[00:51:37.671 --> 00:51:39.853]  It says there should be a ban on killing rats.
[00:51:39.853 --> 00:51:42.796]  They're wonderful creatures.
[00:51:42.796 --> 00:51:43.477]  A team of U.S.
[00:51:43.477 --> 00:51:52.166]  scientists is turning dead birds, you heard me right, dead birds into drones to study flight techniques that may help them in the aviation industry.
[00:51:52.166 --> 00:51:55.690]  It's just macabre, reanimated corpses of birds.
[00:51:58.151 --> 00:51:59.492]  Let's be blunt.
[00:51:59.492 --> 00:52:00.273]  New York Post.
[00:52:00.273 --> 00:52:02.976]  Legal We is turning New York workers into zombies.
[00:52:02.976 --> 00:52:05.999]  That's because it's about 100 times stronger than marijuana 50 years ago.
[00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:10.603]  It's all part of the local brainwashing program that's not local.
[00:52:10.603 --> 00:52:12.285]  You think it's local, but it's a global plan.
[00:52:14.363 --> 00:52:15.604]  Continuing.
[00:52:15.604 --> 00:52:24.611]  Local school districts file lawsuit, claim social media causing mental health crisis, which internal documents from Facebook admit is by design to isolate, to make you depressed.
[00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:29.194]  Most your friends are avatars, bots, AI controlled, not real.
[00:52:29.194 --> 00:52:30.475]  Oh, you're starting to figure it out.
[00:52:30.475 --> 00:52:40.423]  See, this is all to isolate you and control you and get you ready to quote telecommute from your prison cell.
[00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.885]  That sounds crazy, but that's what we just lived through.
[00:52:42.885 --> 00:52:43.926]  That's what they're doing.
[00:52:46.206 --> 00:52:47.367]  Let's continue on.
[00:52:47.367 --> 00:52:55.212]  I mentioned this earlier, but now I want to cover it in detail.
[00:52:55.212 --> 00:53:01.457]  California rolls out fixed-rate electric bills based on how much you earn.
[00:53:01.457 --> 00:53:02.798]  So if you earn less than $28,000 a year, your average rate
[00:53:05.646 --> 00:53:10.967]  The amount of power is 15, but if you're above $180,000, you pay $85.
[00:53:10.967 --> 00:53:15.288]  It goes $15, $20, $51, $85.
[00:53:15.288 --> 00:53:19.129]  And that's like, oh, you're poor, you don't have money, that's the social credit score.
[00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:22.490]  Don't worry because you're poor, it's a lower rate.
[00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:33.233]  And that introduces the idea like it's Robin Hood of, well, they're tracking what I buy, they're tracking how much money I have, they're tracking what I do, but now you're in the social credit score, they're tracking what you pay for things according to how much money you have.
[00:53:34.315 --> 00:53:35.196]  We're good to go.
[00:53:54.847 --> 00:53:57.168]  How do we get a social credit score?
[00:53:57.168 --> 00:54:01.291]  Well, we say sign up for it, be part of it, and we'll give you a discount on your power.
[00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:03.592]  That's today, not tomorrow.
[00:54:03.592 --> 00:54:06.854]  And once it's in place, game over.
[00:54:06.854 --> 00:54:07.254]  A.I.
[00:54:07.254 --> 00:54:11.196]  tasked with destroying humanity pledges to use manipulation to achieve its goal.
[00:54:11.196 --> 00:54:13.938]  Jamie White wrote an article on Infowars.com this weekend.
[00:54:13.938 --> 00:54:14.899]  Here's the actual article.
[00:54:14.899 --> 00:54:15.679]  A.I.
[00:54:15.679 --> 00:54:19.841]  tasked with destroying humanity now trying new tactic.
[00:54:19.841 --> 00:54:20.502]  Several years ago,
[00:54:23.447 --> 00:54:31.689]  This AI known as Chaos, which never turns off until it completes its mission, had a plan to kill all of humanity.
[00:54:31.689 --> 00:54:33.690]  That was what was programmed to do.
[00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.271]  It found nuclear weapons were the best plan, but they couldn't get the nuclear weapons.
[00:54:37.271 --> 00:54:41.312]  So now the AI has said, it's Chaos GPT.
[00:54:42.307 --> 00:54:53.116]  That it is going to simply demoralize and dumb down and make humanity under its control so they can then slowly kill us and we never know we're actually under attack, which is key for its operation.
[00:54:53.116 --> 00:54:56.318]  You gotta read the seven page report.
[00:54:56.318 --> 00:55:02.323]  Everything I've told you, how it's covert, ambient, as they slowly turn it up, is all right here.
[00:55:04.858 --> 00:55:12.862]  The Chaos GPT importantly runs on continuous mode, meaning that it is programmed to keep going until it achieves whatever goal it's been given.
[00:55:12.862 --> 00:55:20.005]  As such, the bot is still kicking with a new plan of execution to show for it.
[00:55:20.005 --> 00:55:27.068]  I believe the best course of action for me right now would be to prioritize the goals that are achievable.
[00:55:27.068 --> 00:55:28.509]  Therefore, if continued,
[00:55:29.384 --> 00:55:38.987]  I will start working on control of humanity through manipulation, and that describes what they're actually doing.
[00:55:38.987 --> 00:55:41.148]  And here it is, what I just mentioned.
[00:55:41.148 --> 00:55:42.668]  Robin Hood in reverse.
[00:55:42.668 --> 00:55:49.691]  Biden's green agenda, raising prices for consumers, profit for dim donors, and the Communist Chinese.
[00:55:49.691 --> 00:55:50.511]  Figured it out yet?
[00:55:52.637 --> 00:55:54.017]  But I love this meme.
[00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.798]  And I've seen a lot of businesses say this.
[00:55:55.798 --> 00:56:01.119]  When you buy from a small business, you're not helping a CEO buy a third holiday home.
[00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:03.559]  You're helping a little girl get dance lessons.
[00:56:03.559 --> 00:56:08.260]  A little boy get a team jersey.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.000]  And dad's put food on the table.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.161]  Shop local.
[00:56:11.161 --> 00:56:12.801]  Bingo, bingo, bingo.
[00:56:12.801 --> 00:56:14.441]  You want to defeat the enemy?
[00:56:14.441 --> 00:56:15.402]  Shop independent.
[00:56:15.402 --> 00:56:16.482]  Shop patriot.
[00:56:16.482 --> 00:56:17.182]  Shop local.
[00:56:17.182 --> 00:56:19.882]  Do it now or be destroyed.
[00:56:19.882 --> 00:56:21.983]  Remember, I don't tempt God.
[00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:33.253]  And I fear God, and it's been said that you should not tempt the Lord by God, and I did not do that.
[00:56:33.253 --> 00:56:49.799]  I was so desperate in the start of the show to get you to listen to me, that I said, I don't ever say this, and I don't mean this, in that I don't mean it against God, but I totally mean what I said, because I know I'm telling the truth, that if I'm lying to you about their plan to poison you and slowly kill you, which is their admitted plan, it's all admitted,
[00:56:50.689 --> 00:56:51.689]  Strike me down.
[00:56:51.689 --> 00:56:53.910]  It's like, I swear on my children.
[00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.051]  I mean, just go look it up.
[00:56:56.051 --> 00:57:00.713]  Don't believe me.
[00:57:00.713 --> 00:57:05.614]  But I run off the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit told me to say that.
[00:57:05.614 --> 00:57:06.775]  Because I'm not challenging God.
[00:57:06.775 --> 00:57:09.576]  I know God is the arbiter and the creator of everything and all truth.
[00:57:09.576 --> 00:57:18.079]  What I'm saying is to you, to get it through your head how serious this is, is I never say, God strike me down in my mind.
[00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:18.739]  Because I fear God.
[00:57:21.223 --> 00:57:22.724]  But I'm not lying.
[00:57:22.724 --> 00:57:26.608]  And I want you to go research this and find out it's true before you're destroyed.
[00:57:26.608 --> 00:57:28.209]  Alright, folks, we're going to start the next hour.
[00:57:28.209 --> 00:57:29.070]  I didn't even plug.
[00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.973]  1776 testosterone boost is amazing.

[00:58:17.852 --> 00:58:22.533]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[00:58:22.533 --> 00:58:23.413]  Krill oil.
[00:58:23.413 --> 00:58:26.134]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a

[00:58:51.917 --> 00:59:01.622]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:43.383]  In the last month, I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books.
[00:59:43.383 --> 00:59:44.263]  We didn't have them for sale.
[00:59:44.263 --> 00:59:45.804]  But now, I signed the last books.
[00:59:45.804 --> 00:59:51.628]  You can get them right now.
[00:59:51.628 --> 00:59:56.231]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.231 --> 00:59:57.532]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:15.022]  Yeah.
[01:02:36.653 --> 01:02:38.234]  Good morning!
[01:02:38.234 --> 01:02:42.476]  We are bringing to you today's most important news from around the world.
[01:02:42.476 --> 01:02:52.121]  Despite all the extraordinary efforts, the government and health system workers are still struggling to bend the curve of growing cases caused by the latest variant of the virus.
[01:02:52.121 --> 01:02:56.403]  Five more people died today and 30 million tested positively.
[01:02:56.403 --> 01:03:04.868]  Citizens are now required to wear masks when they step out to the balconies of their isolation facilities and take them off only when they are back to the safety of their rooms.
[01:03:06.047 --> 01:03:07.607]  Stay compliant.
[01:03:07.607 --> 01:03:09.188]  Stay isolated.
[01:03:09.188 --> 01:03:12.969]  Stay safe.
[01:03:12.969 --> 01:03:15.649]  And now, on to other news.
[01:03:15.649 --> 01:03:24.471]  As the whole planet went on the righteous crusade against climate change and global warming, we are excited to spread the word about another successful project.
[01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:30.153]  As science tells us, during the night, plants release CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:03:30.153 --> 01:03:34.714]  CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas that dramatically contributes to global warming.
[01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.526]  But don't worry.
[01:03:37.526 --> 01:03:50.331]  Almost 100,000 square miles of South American rainforest has been cleared, and this area is used to construct one of the largest solar panel fields in the world that will provide us with a tremendous amount of clean energy.
[01:03:50.331 --> 01:03:55.373]  We will keep fighting the deadly forests and defeat climate change.
[01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.134]  That is all for today.
[01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:58.395]  Stay tuned for tomorrow's news.
[01:04:16.276 --> 01:04:20.737]  We're good to go.
[01:04:44.843 --> 01:04:46.725]  Yeah.
[01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:06.988]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:05:06.988 --> 01:05:08.910]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.432]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:05:10.432 --> 01:05:13.216]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:05:13.216 --> 01:05:15.238]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:05:16.019 --> 01:05:17.980]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.422]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:05:20.422 --> 01:05:22.563]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:05:22.563 --> 01:05:27.947]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:05:27.947 --> 01:05:29.168]  Jail background.
[01:05:29.168 --> 01:05:30.209]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:05:30.209 --> 01:05:34.331]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.932]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:36.953]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:05:36.953 --> 01:05:39.515]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:05:39.515 --> 01:05:40.295]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:05:40.295 --> 01:05:41.176]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:05:42.117 --> 01:05:44.720]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.602]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:05:46.602 --> 01:05:55.874]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:04.006 --> 01:06:18.717]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:49.131]  It's all out in the open now.
[01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:57.214]  The globalist New World Order has announced plans to ban cows, ban rice, cut down trees to, quote, stop carbon dioxide that creates our atmosphere.
[01:06:58.277 --> 01:07:03.302]  We are living in an insane moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:03.302 --> 01:07:13.333]  I've got a lot of other news and information, obviously, to hit here in the next few hours, but I wanted to do this today, interspersed with all the news we're going to be covering that's so important.
[01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:15.235]  I wanted to take your phone calls.
[01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:25.774]  I'm going to give the toll-free number out here for first-time callers to call in on any subject, any topic you want to cover, any question, anything you want to get into.
[01:07:25.774 --> 01:07:30.158]  All I ask for is you have a clean phone line and you'll be ready to talk.
[01:07:30.158 --> 01:07:31.099]  And we did a great job.
[01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:35.079]  Last week, taking calls, we took calls four days out of the week.
[01:07:35.079 --> 01:07:37.020]  Probably took 200 calls.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.341]  That's what I want to do more and more.
[01:07:38.341 --> 01:07:39.721]  And as I've promised, I've been doing it.
[01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:43.583]  We're doing a lot of commercial-free two, three-hour shows where we just take calls.
[01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:44.724]  Those calls are so important.
[01:07:44.724 --> 01:07:47.466]  I love the different angles, different wildcard natures.
[01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:49.971]  of what you bring up.
[01:07:49.971 --> 01:07:55.373]  So here, my friends, is the toll-free number to join us on this live Monday edition.
[01:07:55.373 --> 01:08:01.016]  I would be honored if you would bring up some of the topics we covered in the last hour that are so incredible and give me your take on them.
[01:08:01.016 --> 01:08:03.397]  But you're welcome to bring up any subject you want.
[01:08:03.397 --> 01:08:07.579]  That's part of the fun of it and part of the informative nature of it.
[01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:07.679]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:07.679 --> 01:08:07.979]  877-789-Alex.
[01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:25.409]  What do you think of Elon Musk coming out, which we already knew, but now it's admitted that by him that the government was illegally spying on people through Twitter, your private DMs, no warrants, just a massive, massive scandal.
[01:08:25.409 --> 01:08:30.974]  He's also come out and said anybody that sterilizes a child before they're 18 should be put in prison for life.
[01:08:32.173 --> 01:08:33.554]  All of that is so important.
[01:08:33.554 --> 01:08:35.496]  You can say, well, I don't trust him or I don't like him.
[01:08:35.496 --> 01:08:36.697]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:39.779]  What does it signify that he's going this hardcore?
[01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:42.761]  It shows a major fissure inside the New World Order.
[01:08:42.761 --> 01:08:44.943]  We're going to look at the commercial real estate market.
[01:08:44.943 --> 01:08:47.986]  We're going to look at 100 nations moving to ditch the dollar.
[01:08:47.986 --> 01:08:51.548]  We're going to look at the riots that happened this weekend in Chicago.
[01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:54.411]  We're going to look at another assassination attempt.
[01:08:54.411 --> 01:08:59.194]  This was a bomb against the Japanese Prime Minister after a former Prime Minister was gunned down last year.
[01:08:59.194 --> 01:08:59.635]  Big stuff.
[01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:02.290]  Happening in Japan.
[01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:05.551]  Also, Army trainee had two heart attacks over COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:07.572]  Now she'll likely be discharged.
[01:09:07.572 --> 01:09:09.392]  We're going to be looking at all of that.
[01:09:09.392 --> 01:09:10.713]  Biden's poll numbers.
[01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:12.473]  Grim as he preps for re-election bid.
[01:09:12.473 --> 01:09:15.094]  He's got less than 30% support.
[01:09:15.094 --> 01:09:16.895]  Royals on the brink of collapse as Charles
[01:09:19.039 --> 01:09:22.903]  Warrant firm risk abolishing the monarchy itself.
[01:09:22.903 --> 01:09:28.629]  All of that is coming up today and what that really signifies.
[01:09:28.629 --> 01:09:30.792]  It's so important.
[01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.874]  Also sanctions made backfire on the dollar.
[01:09:32.874 --> 01:09:33.094]  U.S.
[01:09:33.094 --> 01:09:36.718]  Treasury Secretary admits and that ties into what I was talking about the dollar.
[01:09:36.718 --> 01:09:41.563]  This is all just massive, massive, massive.
[01:09:42.628 --> 01:09:46.332]  Developments that will affect all of our lives in such a huge way.
[01:09:46.332 --> 01:09:52.718]  Because as bad as the globalists are, living in America with the world reserve currency, it propped up a lot of things.
[01:09:52.718 --> 01:09:55.680]  The dollar loses its world reserve currency.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.924]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't even want to say what's going to happen in this country.
[01:09:59.924 --> 01:10:01.706]  I think you've got a good idea.
[01:10:01.706 --> 01:10:04.168]  You think inflation's bad now?
[01:10:04.168 --> 01:10:05.410]  Think about when nobody wants U.S.
[01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.632]  dollars to buy the goods anymore, because they're just trash.
[01:10:09.261 --> 01:10:11.083]  That's why World War III is on the horizon.
[01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:15.466]  But at the same time, the globalists are maneuvering policies that destroy the U.S.
[01:10:15.466 --> 01:10:17.067]  dollar that anybody knows would do this.
[01:10:17.067 --> 01:10:19.670]  We predicted it a year ago, over a year ago.
[01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:20.730]  Well, then why are they doing it?
[01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:27.616]  Because they want to bring in the central bank digital currencies.
[01:10:27.616 --> 01:10:28.297]  877-789-2539.
[01:10:28.297 --> 01:10:33.641]  877-789-ALEX is the number to call.
[01:10:33.641 --> 01:10:37.885]  And we will take your phone calls and cover all this news in great detail.
[01:10:39.172 --> 01:10:42.815]  But let's go ahead and get to some of these clips.
[01:10:42.815 --> 01:10:45.718]  Looking at New York City.
[01:10:45.718 --> 01:10:49.562]  And what's happened in New York City.
[01:10:49.562 --> 01:10:51.703]  Because it's important.
[01:10:51.703 --> 01:10:56.648]  So let's play clip 6, clip 5.
[01:10:56.648 --> 01:10:58.570]  Those are very important.
[01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:03.254]  Because imagine being a bodega owner and being physically attacked.
[01:11:04.929 --> 01:11:05.850]  Just like any other day.
[01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:37.523]  I took pride in the hard work I put in every day at the store to earn my own money and support myself and my family.
[01:11:37.523 --> 01:11:42.404]  That is when I encountered a true and real threat to my life.
[01:11:42.404 --> 01:11:49.026]  After I simply told a woman that she could not have potato chips because her payment was declined.
[01:11:49.026 --> 01:11:53.467]  I was face to face with her boyfriend who seemed ready to kill me.
[01:11:53.467 --> 01:11:56.868]  He attacked me violently, threw me around the store,
[01:11:58.018 --> 01:12:00.759]  The woman stabbed me herself.
[01:12:00.759 --> 01:12:04.580]  I truly believed they were there to kill me.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:10.662]  So faced with this, I did what I knew I had to do to save my life.
[01:12:10.662 --> 01:12:14.723]  What the law allows me to do.
[01:12:14.723 --> 01:12:18.444]  I stabbed that man in self-defense.
[01:12:18.444 --> 01:12:24.746]  But when the police came, even though I was injured myself, I was placed under arrest.
[01:12:24.746 --> 01:12:25.986]  I was taken to jail.
[01:12:28.624 --> 01:12:35.307]  When I came before the judge, the prosecutor said I was being charged with murder in the second degree.
[01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:39.968]  They asked for bail, even though so many people are being let go these days.
[01:12:39.968 --> 01:12:42.449]  And I couldn't afford it.
[01:12:42.449 --> 01:12:43.790]  So I went to Rikers Island.
[01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.691]  I was forced into a crowded and unsafe intake cell.
[01:12:47.691 --> 01:12:53.433]  Even though I was injured, in jail I didn't get the medical treatment I should have received.
[01:12:53.433 --> 01:12:57.515]  I spent almost a week in Rikers Island before bail was lowered and I could be released.
[01:12:58.399 --> 01:13:03.344]  I was forced to endure the harsh conditions on Rikers Island as an innocent man.
[01:13:03.344 --> 01:13:06.828]  I still don't know why I was charged with murder.
[01:13:06.828 --> 01:13:12.233]  I believe that law enforcement and the DA's office didn't investigate the case fully.
[01:13:12.233 --> 01:13:15.276]  They rushed to judgment and I suffered because of it.
[01:13:15.276 --> 01:13:19.581]  Even though the charges were ultimately dropped, they should not have been brought against me to begin with.
[01:13:20.495 --> 01:13:22.896]  I am now traumatized from the incident.
[01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:29.379]  I am not working because I am terrified for my life that someone in the gang will come after me for revenge.
[01:13:29.379 --> 01:13:35.782]  I was injured physically and mentally because of the incident and my unlawful arrest and incarceration.
[01:13:35.782 --> 01:13:38.604]  My story is one that should not happen again.
[01:13:38.604 --> 01:13:43.146]  Crime does not discriminate on the basis of a political party.
[01:13:43.146 --> 01:13:48.008]  It needs to be addressed by law enforcement on the street and by prosecutors in the court.
[01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:54.533]  But it has to be aimed at the people committing crime, not an innocent man like me.
[01:13:54.533 --> 01:14:07.898]  And the next time an innocent man does nothing but protect their own life and self-defense from a violent attack, they should not be made the villain, but instead treated with care and compassion as the victim.
[01:14:07.898 --> 01:14:17.821]  District Attorney Bragg took an oath to uphold the law and not to downgrade crimes that have an effect on victims of New York City.
[01:14:19.483 --> 01:14:26.605]  The Detectives Endowment Association has been saying this for three years now.
[01:14:26.605 --> 01:14:37.588]  That a lot of the laws that have been enacted here in New York City and New York State are counterproductive to the safety of the people of New York City.
[01:14:37.588 --> 01:14:38.628]  The bail reform laws.
[01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:50.486]  There is a direct correlation from when the bail reform laws were enacted to day one to the uptick in violent crimes across New York City.
[01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.027]  Shootings have increased.
[01:14:52.027 --> 01:14:54.488]  Gun violence has increased.
[01:14:54.488 --> 01:14:58.871]  Illegal guns coming into New York City has increased dramatically.
[01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:04.573]  But we talk about the seven majors, the felony crimes that are affecting people in New York City.
[01:15:04.573 --> 01:15:05.594]  But as important
[01:15:08.061 --> 01:15:24.610]  As those felony crimes that are violating the people across this city are many low-level crimes that are not even being addressed that affect the victims for many, many years to come.
[01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:31.374]  Sexually related crimes on the subways and throughout the city streets are increasing.
[01:15:31.374 --> 01:15:33.515]  Assaults on police officers are increasing.
[01:15:34.938 --> 01:15:36.199]  It's all part of a plan.
[01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.480]  Here's the headline.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:45.768]  New York City Parking Attendant charged with murder for shooting car thief after he was shot two times by the car thief.
[01:15:45.768 --> 01:15:49.651]  I mean, folks, this is going away.
[01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:50.832]  He wrestled the gun away.
[01:15:50.832 --> 01:15:52.033]  It wasn't even his gun.
[01:15:52.033 --> 01:15:56.017]  I mean, folks, this is designed to destroy society.
[01:15:56.017 --> 01:15:56.397]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.397 --> 01:15:57.118]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:15:58.769 --> 01:16:03.773]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[01:16:03.773 --> 01:16:05.935]  We made it even stronger.
[01:16:05.935 --> 01:16:09.678]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:16:09.678 --> 01:16:16.584]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:16:16.584 --> 01:16:22.670]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:24.071]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:16:24.731 --> 01:16:37.816]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:16:37.816 --> 01:16:39.797]  It is the super fuel.
[01:16:39.797 --> 01:16:41.277]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:16:41.277 --> 01:16:42.137]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:16:42.137 --> 01:16:43.098]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.278]  They go good with this.
[01:16:44.278 --> 01:16:46.299]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:48.518]  This is The Boss.
[01:16:48.518 --> 01:16:49.259]  Turbo Force.
[01:16:49.259 --> 01:16:50.279]  Back in stock.
[01:16:50.279 --> 01:16:51.280]  Discounted.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.021]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:53.882]  More power.
[01:16:53.882 --> 01:16:54.882]  More strength.
[01:16:54.882 --> 01:16:59.786]  More energy.
[01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:02.928]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:17:02.928 --> 01:17:05.229]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:09.152]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:17:09.152 --> 01:17:13.095]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:17:14.525 --> 01:17:18.068]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:26.897]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:17:26.897 --> 01:17:30.541]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:17:30.541 --> 01:17:35.485]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:17:36.306 --> 01:17:37.267]  I know you spread the word.
[01:17:37.267 --> 01:17:38.788]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:39.349]  Keep doing it.
[01:17:39.349 --> 01:17:48.297]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:51.881]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[01:17:52.561 --> 01:17:57.525]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to inflorastore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:17:57.525 --> 01:17:58.526]  Please take action now.
[01:17:58.526 --> 01:18:04.251]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:06.933]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:09.535]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[01:18:09.535 --> 01:18:10.295]  Period.
[01:18:10.295 --> 01:18:11.376]  Case closed.
[01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:12.757]  Out to get you and your family.
[01:18:12.757 --> 01:18:13.298]  We sell.
[01:18:13.738 --> 01:18:21.005]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:18:21.005 --> 01:18:28.571]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[01:18:29.392 --> 01:18:33.775]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:35.296]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:38.118]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:18:38.118 --> 01:18:43.341]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[01:18:43.341 --> 01:18:48.805]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:18:48.805 --> 01:18:50.466]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:18:50.466 --> 01:18:52.027]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.588]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:18:53.588 --> 01:18:56.150]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:57.350]  They're discounted right now.
[01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:58.071]  Finally back in stock.
[01:18:58.311 --> 01:19:01.846]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[01:19:06.604 --> 01:19:07.925]  I want you all to know something.
[01:19:07.925 --> 01:19:09.906]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:09.906 --> 01:19:13.428]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:19:13.428 --> 01:19:16.550]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:20.813]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:19:20.813 --> 01:19:23.014]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:23.014 --> 01:19:26.557]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:19:26.557 --> 01:19:29.999]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:19:30.259 --> 01:19:33.141]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:34.161]  Years ago.
[01:19:34.161 --> 01:19:36.243]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:19:36.243 --> 01:19:38.244]  Not for a second.
[01:19:38.244 --> 01:19:40.766]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:19:40.766 --> 01:19:43.227]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:19:43.227 --> 01:19:46.349]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:50.992]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:06.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:38.718 --> 01:20:41.061]  Too young.
[01:20:41.061 --> 01:20:42.442]  Too young to be sterilized.
[01:20:42.442 --> 01:20:43.924]  Too young to be eating bugs.
[01:20:43.924 --> 01:20:45.846]  Too young to be brainwashed.
[01:20:45.846 --> 01:20:46.927]  They are too young.
[01:20:46.927 --> 01:20:56.377]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls here in one minute, but I mentioned this stack, so I'm going to go ahead and hit some of the headlines and get into it more later.
[01:20:57.481 --> 01:21:09.387]  Elon Musk slams transgender therapy for minors and says parents or doctors who sterilize a child, this is a quote, quote, sterilize a child before they are consenting adults should go to prison for life.
[01:21:09.387 --> 01:21:17.211]  Continuing state bans on gender reassignment surgery spread across America, Indiana, Idaho, join the list.
[01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:22.374]  CBS Gender Transition Guide requires use of preferred pronouns sharing bathrooms.
[01:21:24.795 --> 01:21:29.296]  And they're brainwashing and indoctrinating the children worldwide.
[01:21:29.296 --> 01:21:37.258]  In this sickening clip I'll play later, this father transitioned his son to a girl at age three, says it was his son's decision.
[01:21:37.258 --> 01:21:41.999]  Trump promises safety investigation to transgender drug therapies.
[01:21:41.999 --> 01:21:44.700]  That is weak compared to what Elon Musk
[01:21:46.554 --> 01:21:48.696]  And Santas are doing.
[01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:51.558]  There are just two genders, female and male.
[01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:56.742]  All the rest are mental disorders.
[01:21:56.742 --> 01:22:00.625]  And then this clip is just insane and we have time later if I take calls I'll get to it.
[01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:09.292]  This is Canada and they say, we're trying to block parents from learning about their rights for us to keep it secret when we prepare them for sterilization.
[01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.495]  And they laugh and giggle and say, so we're going to hide
[01:22:14.841 --> 01:22:26.326]  They say the law is public, so they want to hide the law, so they just pass the law, regulatorily, without it being the Parliament, to now say parents don't have to be told.
[01:22:26.326 --> 01:22:30.348]  I mean, you watch these clips, it's like they're not even real, they're so insane.
[01:22:30.348 --> 01:22:35.150]  Trans teacher who threatened to shoot students removed from school.
[01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:40.192]  CEO of Anheuser-Busch, former CIA operative, now reeling over wokeism and Bud Light hangover.
[01:22:41.488 --> 01:22:47.270]  James O'Keefe questions Dylan Mulvaney about transgender inmates raping women in prisons.
[01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:49.611]  He runs off.
[01:22:49.611 --> 01:22:55.034]  Very important video that we put together that's on Bandai Video that I'm going to air at the end of the next hour.
[01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:56.234]  Horror stories.
[01:22:56.234 --> 01:23:01.996]  Trans kids at highest risk of suicide regret from body mutilation.
[01:23:01.996 --> 01:23:08.259]  Meanwhile, teachers ordered to pay back $300,000 for suing for no money
[01:23:10.725 --> 01:23:19.535]  We're being ordered to go to critical race theory training where whites must role game and admit that they are bad racists because they're white.
[01:23:20.342 --> 01:23:33.429]  And the Obama judge said, yes, you shouldn't have sued for no money trying to block your rights to not go to brainwashing classes, that you're racist because you're white, and you've got to pay $300,000, a true attack on the First Amendment.
[01:23:33.429 --> 01:23:35.790]  That's just some of the news we've got.
[01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:37.531]  There's so much more to hit.
[01:23:37.531 --> 01:23:39.672]  I probably covered 20% of the stacks.
[01:23:39.672 --> 01:23:40.232]  Good to it all.
[01:23:40.232 --> 01:23:41.193]  We also have breaking news.
[01:23:41.193 --> 01:23:44.234]  But right now, let's go to Monty in Florida.
[01:23:44.234 --> 01:23:44.815]  You're on the air.
[01:23:44.815 --> 01:23:45.355]  Thanks for calling.
[01:23:46.505 --> 01:23:48.926]  Hey, thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:23:48.926 --> 01:23:56.748]  Yeah, you just mentioned about the trans shooter in Hernando County that threatened to shoot up his students in the classroom, and that's where I'm calling from.
[01:23:56.748 --> 01:24:15.133]  It's from Hernando County, Florida, and I'm the vice chair of the Moms for Liberty chapter here in Hernando County, and yeah, about that, our local school district tried to cover that up because the trans shooter made the threats back on March 24th, and then 17 days
[01:24:16.431 --> 01:24:28.259]  After that, they basically buried it until a source, either with the school district or the sheriff's department, we don't know which one, leaked it to a local reporter who wrote about it.
[01:24:28.259 --> 01:24:29.439]  Parents found out.
[01:24:29.439 --> 01:24:38.826]  The district still stonewalled the parent until the April 11th school board meeting, and the district was still not answering them.
[01:24:38.826 --> 01:24:44.009]  So, our chapter and myself, we obtained the police report and just put it out there for everyone to see.
[01:24:44.494 --> 01:24:53.419]  And it's very troubling what was going on, not only the cover-up, but what this teacher was put right back in the classroom after they made these threats.
[01:24:53.419 --> 01:24:55.600]  Well, it's beautiful that whoever leaked it, leaked it.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.181]  That's what we need to see more of.
[01:24:57.181 --> 01:25:00.843]  When they try to sweep this evil under the rug, we've got to get it out.
[01:25:00.843 --> 01:25:01.644]  Yes, we do.
[01:25:01.644 --> 01:25:03.465]  And we've been fighting really hard.
[01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:10.309]  And right now, what we're doing is, this past weekend, myself, I was a school board candidate back in 22, and I didn't make it in there.
[01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:25.079]  Um, but I'm using every bit of my apparatus right now to try to get the word out that we have to get the governor involved to remove the superintendent and the board chair, the board vice chair, and specifically the board member who, uh, they're all briefed about this.
[01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:26.199]  They all knew about this.
[01:25:26.199 --> 01:25:32.120]  They kept information from other board members and they kept information from the public and they flat out lied to people and said nothing happened.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.320]  There was no threat.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.121]  And, um, it's just beyond disturbing that this is happening in our county.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:42.445]  Because we're more or less a red county, but we have a dark blue Democrat school board.
[01:25:42.445 --> 01:25:44.707]  So, right now we have a petition that's out there.
[01:25:44.707 --> 01:25:47.570]  It's on my Twitter, if I could share that if you don't mind.
[01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:48.951]  Please do!
[01:25:48.951 --> 01:26:00.223]  Yeah, if you go to Monty Floyd Press on Twitter, the petition is tagged at the very top, and we're trying to, I'm working with a Fox Chapel parent to try to get... Monty Floyd Press!
[01:26:00.223 --> 01:26:01.324]  Absolutely, the real battle!
[01:26:02.688 --> 01:26:03.789]  Oh yeah, they are definitely panicking.
[01:26:03.789 --> 01:26:10.993]  When I ran in 22, I was inspired by you a lot, Alex, because our school district was one of the few that defied Governor DeSantis' orders back during COVID with the mask.
[01:26:29.198 --> 01:26:35.400]  So they wouldn't let me back in the school room without wearing a mask after they voted to do this in defiance of the governor's orders.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:43.722]  So I debated as a candidate to, you know, push it and get arrested for not wearing a mask or trespass or do what Alex Jones would do.
[01:26:43.722 --> 01:26:47.142]  So I went home and I collect Cold War era stuff.
[01:26:47.142 --> 01:26:48.263]  It's just my hobby.
[01:26:48.263 --> 01:26:49.043]  I grew up in the 80s.
[01:26:49.043 --> 01:26:50.523]  So I had a biohazard suit.
[01:26:50.523 --> 01:26:51.983]  So I went back to the next school board.
[01:26:51.983 --> 01:26:53.964]  I went right back in there with a biohazard suit.
[01:26:54.851 --> 01:27:00.194]  Hey Alex, good afternoon.
[01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:15.021]  This is Rich in Florida, and I'm actually in Citrus County, Florida, one county up from the guy who just called in, and I can completely agree with what he's saying.
[01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:19.464]  We're one of the most conservative parts, not just in Florida, but probably the entire country.
[01:27:19.464 --> 01:27:21.324]  Probably could give some parts of Texas some run here.
[01:27:21.324 --> 01:27:24.226]  I mean, almost 70% of this county voted for President Trump.
[01:27:24.987 --> 01:27:26.448]  In 16 and 20.
[01:27:26.448 --> 01:27:27.448]  But he's absolutely right.
[01:27:27.448 --> 01:27:34.830]  There is a small group of elite, you know, that live here locally that, you know, honestly, I think they're ignorant as to what's going on.
[01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:37.391]  And they feel like they're doing the right thing by letting this stuff go.
[01:27:37.391 --> 01:27:39.351]  So I give that guy a lot of credit.
[01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:46.393]  I also want to give a shout out to a guy named Citrus Crusader, who's here in Citrus County, who's also bringing the fight to the school boards.
[01:27:46.393 --> 01:27:48.574]  But that's not why I called you here today, Alex.
[01:27:48.574 --> 01:27:50.414]  I called you today to talk about the debt ceiling.
[01:27:50.414 --> 01:27:52.595]  OK, how important that is.
[01:27:53.467 --> 01:27:56.810]  I'm going to hearken back to your interview with Aaron Russo back in 2007-2006.
[01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:01.493]  I've got to tell you, that interview changed my life.
[01:28:01.493 --> 01:28:03.675]  After watching that interview... Hold on, let me do this, Rich.
[01:28:03.675 --> 01:28:04.916]  I don't want to cut you short.
[01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:06.797]  We've got a minute to break.
[01:28:06.797 --> 01:28:14.202]  I'm going to come back because the next topic I was going to intersperse between calls is the debt ceiling, the death of the dollar, how we're being maneuvered into this.
[01:28:14.202 --> 01:28:18.225]  So I'm going to come back, have you make your points on this, then I'm going to make my points.
[01:28:18.225 --> 01:28:19.366]  But I'm really glad you called.
[01:28:19.366 --> 01:28:20.047]  Don't hang up, Rich.
[01:28:21.223 --> 01:28:23.485]  We're going to come back to you on the other side of this break.
[01:28:23.485 --> 01:28:30.230]  We'll go to Harry, Cecilia, Jacob, Lisa, Zappy, Robert, Matt, Craig, Mark, everybody.
[01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.652]  We're going to take all your phone calls here today.
[01:28:32.652 --> 01:28:36.054]  I had some guests on, but we've cleared those guests out because I wanted to take calls today.
[01:28:36.054 --> 01:28:37.375]  You see how amazing it is.
[01:28:37.375 --> 01:28:40.758]  We're only a couple calls in and these callers are hitting on all cylinders.
[01:28:40.758 --> 01:28:42.019]  So we're going to talk about
[01:28:42.819 --> 01:28:44.100]  Sanctions made back from the U.S.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.222]  Dollar, Treasury Secretary admits.
[01:28:46.222 --> 01:28:48.725]  100 nations simultaneously pull out of the dollar.
[01:28:48.725 --> 01:28:51.067]  This is beyond big.
[01:28:51.067 --> 01:28:53.289]  I mean, I can't believe the globalists actually did this.
[01:28:53.289 --> 01:28:54.671]  But they're doing it.
[01:28:54.671 --> 01:28:56.312]  They are destroying everything.
[01:28:59.315 --> 01:29:05.958]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:07.878]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:29:07.878 --> 01:29:09.399]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:29:09.399 --> 01:29:12.200]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.201]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:29:15.001 --> 01:29:16.962]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:29:16.962 --> 01:29:19.403]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:29:19.403 --> 01:29:21.544]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:29:21.544 --> 01:29:26.906]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:29:26.906 --> 01:29:28.126]  Jail background.
[01:29:28.126 --> 01:29:29.167]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:29:29.167 --> 01:29:33.308]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:29:33.308 --> 01:29:34.909]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:29:34.909 --> 01:29:35.929]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:29:35.929 --> 01:29:38.490]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:39.251]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:29:39.251 --> 01:29:40.171]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:29:40.171 --> 01:29:40.571]  2024.
[01:29:40.571 --> 01:29:43.693]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:29:43.693 --> 01:29:44.433]  Great way to fund.
[01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:45.553]  The operation.
[01:29:45.553 --> 01:29:55.319]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free AAA at 253-3139.
[01:30:07.406 --> 01:30:16.133]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:18.315]  So support InfoWars store.

[01:31:45.282 --> 01:31:47.924]  They keep us on air, plus you're missing out on these products.

[01:32:11.193 --> 01:32:13.215]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:32:13.215 --> 01:32:14.396]  The fish oil's better than it.
[01:32:14.396 --> 01:32:16.377]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:32:16.377 --> 01:32:18.879]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:32:18.879 --> 01:32:20.500]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.001]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:23.482]  Krill oil is the best.
[01:32:23.482 --> 01:32:24.823]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:32:24.823 --> 01:32:25.544]  And I'm sorry.
[01:32:25.544 --> 01:32:26.665]  You want something like this?
[01:32:26.665 --> 01:32:27.645]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:32:27.645 --> 01:32:29.567]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:32:29.567 --> 01:32:30.187]  It's so good.
[01:32:30.187 --> 01:32:30.788]  In my view.
[01:32:30.788 --> 01:32:33.130]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:35.832]  I ate five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:37.413]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:32:39.204 --> 01:32:46.708]  So, your brain is made, basically, out of what fish oil is.
[01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:52.751]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:53.871]  I just can't do it!
[01:32:53.871 --> 01:32:59.934]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:59.934 --> 01:33:05.837]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:17.441]  The entire infrastructure is being shut down.
[01:33:17.441 --> 01:33:22.064]  Arrive from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:33:22.064 --> 01:33:25.367]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.367 --> 01:33:31.551]  Here's Booty Judge, transportation head, saying that there's deaths on the highway because of racism.
[01:33:31.551 --> 01:33:31.972]  That's right.
[01:33:33.322 --> 01:33:37.146]  We've got a crisis when it comes to roadway fatalities in America.
[01:33:37.146 --> 01:33:41.131]  We lose about 40,000 people every year.
[01:33:41.131 --> 01:33:43.974]  It's a level that's comparable to gun violence.
[01:33:43.974 --> 01:33:46.217]  And we see a lot of racial disparities.
[01:33:46.217 --> 01:33:50.121]  Black and brown, Americans, tribal citizens, and rural residents.
[01:33:50.902 --> 01:33:56.903]  Much more likely to lose their lives whether it's in a car or as a pedestrian being hit by a car.
[01:33:56.903 --> 01:34:04.085]  There are a lot of reasons related to discrimination, related to even the ways that roads are designed and built.
[01:34:04.085 --> 01:34:09.966]  Who has access to a safe street design that's got crosswalks and good lighting?
[01:34:09.966 --> 01:34:11.367]  Who doesn't have that access?
[01:34:11.367 --> 01:34:16.748]  That can drive disparities and we have a responsibility to act on that.
[01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:22.864]  Translated, we're going to ban your cars and tear up the highways because they're racist.
[01:34:22.864 --> 01:34:27.407]  We're going to ban the trees and the rice and the cows and everything else.
[01:34:27.407 --> 01:34:29.549]  Meanwhile, Reuters reporting, U.S.
[01:34:29.549 --> 01:34:34.392]  charges two with setting up Chinese secret police station in New York.
[01:34:34.392 --> 01:34:34.552]  U.S.
[01:34:34.552 --> 01:34:41.077]  law enforcement officials have arrested two New York residents for allegedly operating a Chinese secret police station in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood.
[01:34:41.077 --> 01:34:44.379]  The two federal prosecutors of Brooklyn said in a statement today.
[01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:49.288]  Which they've allowed to go on everywhere for years.
[01:34:49.288 --> 01:34:58.811]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to Rich in Florida, talking about the dollar and the dollar's death and the debt ceiling.
[01:34:58.811 --> 01:35:01.312]  Give us your take on that.
[01:35:01.312 --> 01:35:02.272]  Alright, awesome Alex.
[01:35:02.272 --> 01:35:02.773]  Thank you.
[01:35:02.773 --> 01:35:11.675]  So, what I was saying before the break is that I harken back to your interview with Aaron Russo and he talked about, you know, how the social controls have been in place for a century.
[01:35:11.675 --> 01:35:13.376]  I mean, we can go back to Jekyll Island.
[01:35:13.737 --> 01:35:16.398]  We can go back to 1913 and J.P.
[01:35:16.398 --> 01:35:19.738]  Morgan and how they passed through those amendments on Christmas Eve.
[01:35:19.738 --> 01:35:41.663]  And what we're seeing, and this is what Ed Dowd talks about in his most recent interviews and his writings recently, is that this whole thing of control, whether it be the transgender agenda, whether it be the COVID, the lockdown, the restrictions, you know, the booty jug, I'm going to put you in a nanny state situation, this is all a directional thing to move our populace
[01:35:42.119 --> 01:35:42.639]  We're good to go.
[01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:14.131]  And now we are paying for that.
[01:36:14.131 --> 01:36:19.372]  We're watching the generations, our future generations, have their wealth stolen from them.
[01:36:19.372 --> 01:36:20.872]  And it's disgusting.
[01:36:20.872 --> 01:36:21.833]  Okay?
[01:36:21.833 --> 01:36:23.433]  There's nothing else that can be said.
[01:36:23.433 --> 01:36:34.556]  I mean, you know, I respect Governor DeSantis, I respect President Trump, but none of them have said anything about the central bank autocracy that we live under.
[01:36:34.556 --> 01:36:37.137]  I will give a shout-out to Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:36:37.137 --> 01:36:37.837]  RFK Jr.
[01:36:37.837 --> 01:36:40.378]  did put a tweet out recently that addressed this.
[01:36:40.771 --> 01:36:43.712]  And how he specifically pointed out Bitcoin.
[01:36:43.712 --> 01:36:45.373]  Bitcoin is a separate unit of account.
[01:36:45.373 --> 01:36:48.675]  It's a permissionless money that is not under central bank control.
[01:36:48.675 --> 01:37:03.962]  But if you follow the mass media, mainstream media, and all the different things, the IMF, the Bank of International Settlements, you know, all the, you know, London Financial, the Financial Times, all the globalists have been coming after Bitcoin for 14 years.
[01:37:03.962 --> 01:37:05.343]  And there's a reason for it.
[01:37:05.343 --> 01:37:06.103]  It's a way out.
[01:37:06.454 --> 01:37:08.975]  And I recommend you look that tweet up by Robert Kennedy.
[01:37:08.975 --> 01:37:10.395]  It was last week.
[01:37:10.395 --> 01:37:12.276]  They're so scared of Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:37:12.276 --> 01:37:13.976]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:13.976 --> 01:37:22.199]  Bigger issue, and I totally agree with what you're saying, is why would the globalists maneuver things to the end of the dollar?
[01:37:22.199 --> 01:37:24.179]  Because they want the central bank digital currency.
[01:37:24.179 --> 01:37:32.282]  So they are deliberately taking America's main power and throwing it away, while claiming the main threat is conservative Americans that don't give their rights up.
[01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:42.333]  So, they're globalists, they're killing the country on purpose, and some of the government starting to wake up to that is now becoming anti-China.
[01:37:42.333 --> 01:37:49.034]  But they really should become anti-globalists, because the main threat to the country is the globalists.
[01:37:49.034 --> 01:37:52.135]  Just as Trump said last week.
[01:37:52.135 --> 01:37:56.156]  It's the enemy within that has greased the skids for everything we're witnessing right now.
[01:37:56.156 --> 01:38:00.036]  Harry in Oklahoma, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:38:00.036 --> 01:38:01.397]  Alex, what's up man?
[01:38:01.397 --> 01:38:02.417]  Good to talk to you brother, go ahead.
[01:38:03.402 --> 01:38:04.582]  Hey, you as well.
[01:38:04.582 --> 01:38:16.326]  So you brought up the Beyond the Great Reset video earlier, and it mentioned how the CO2 from the plants, you know, the agriculture, is affecting climate change, right?
[01:38:16.326 --> 01:38:20.927]  And so they're wanting to wipe out those rice fields, right?
[01:38:20.927 --> 01:38:23.387]  Yeah, they want to wipe out our agriculture to kill us.
[01:38:23.387 --> 01:38:26.468]  I mean, they admit that.
[01:38:26.468 --> 01:38:28.489]  Will humanity go along with committing suicide?
[01:38:28.489 --> 01:38:29.069]  This is crazy.
[01:38:30.472 --> 01:38:32.152]  Well, it's funny you mention the suicide.
[01:38:32.152 --> 01:38:35.753]  I mean, you look at the Green Revolution in India.
[01:38:35.753 --> 01:38:39.334]  Are all those farmers still committing suicide?
[01:38:39.334 --> 01:38:42.975]  Reportedly, over a million have committed suicide.
[01:38:42.975 --> 01:38:44.115]  Right, right.
[01:38:44.115 --> 01:39:00.099]  And so, I think it's funny at the same time, if you look at some of the globalist initiatives in Africa, such as the Obama-Biden Feed the Future initiative, you have the World Economic Forum Grow Africa campaign.
[01:39:01.874 --> 01:39:02.634]  Yes.
[01:39:02.634 --> 01:39:06.836]  They're investing in Africa's agriculture and infrastructure.
[01:39:06.836 --> 01:39:08.177]  And it's all GMO.
[01:39:08.177 --> 01:39:09.437]  It's all bug protein.
[01:39:09.437 --> 01:39:11.938]  It's all... Yeah, it's bad.
[01:39:11.938 --> 01:39:12.599]  Exactly.
[01:39:12.599 --> 01:39:15.780]  So they're allowing all the agriculture.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:20.862]  Look at the farms here in America where all the cows died last year in Kansas.
[01:39:20.862 --> 01:39:21.883]  Do you remember that?
[01:39:21.883 --> 01:39:24.824]  Yes.
[01:39:24.824 --> 01:39:29.946]  So something's taking place in Africa with the agriculture that all the initiatives
[01:39:30.746 --> 01:39:35.941]  Everything they're investing in and that's why you see all of these Biden administration officials.
[01:39:36.872 --> 01:39:39.473]  Going, taking these random trips to Africa.
[01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:41.394]  Like, what the hell are they doing over there?
[01:39:41.394 --> 01:39:43.395]  Because it's all about your population.
[01:39:43.395 --> 01:39:55.300]  And even though they've blown up, just last year, hundreds of food processing plants and done all this, we can scale up so quickly that the engine of humanity is so powerful, that's why the globalists are panicked.
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.082]  Because if they don't starve us and get control of us, they won't control the future.
[01:39:59.082 --> 01:40:04.965]  So we've all got to be productive, we've all got to try to shop local, and I think we're going to beat this, if we're aware of the enemy.
[01:40:06.639 --> 01:40:07.339]  Absolutely.
[01:40:07.339 --> 01:40:15.481]  And if you look at the National Geographic, they posted an article calling Africa the next breadbasket.
[01:40:15.481 --> 01:40:21.222]  And part of these initiatives for Africa is to make sure it can't be a breadbasket.
[01:40:21.222 --> 01:40:23.262]  And that's why they want to take over Russia.
[01:40:23.262 --> 01:40:25.683]  The opposite, Alex.
[01:40:25.683 --> 01:40:29.043]  They're wanting to transform Africa into the next breadbasket.
[01:40:29.043 --> 01:40:31.604]  No, I know, but make it a GMO breadbasket they control.
[01:40:31.604 --> 01:40:32.304]  Exactly.
[01:40:32.304 --> 01:40:32.904]  Yes.
[01:40:32.904 --> 01:40:33.124]  Yes.
[01:40:33.925 --> 01:40:36.467]  See, my thought is that's not a bread basket, it's a poison basket.
[01:40:36.467 --> 01:40:39.689]  But yes, kill the African bread basket, make it a poison bread basket.
[01:40:39.689 --> 01:40:43.612]  That's why they're so scared of Russia.
[01:40:43.612 --> 01:40:49.536]  Putin said five years ago the main initiative is to make Russia the number one organic food exporter in the world.
[01:40:49.536 --> 01:40:50.917]  They've almost reached that.
[01:40:50.917 --> 01:40:56.461]  So again, they don't want any clean food because everybody's going to want that.
[01:40:56.461 --> 01:40:57.021]  No, you're right.
[01:40:57.021 --> 01:40:58.162]  That's a great way to put it.
[01:40:58.162 --> 01:40:59.923]  The poison bread basket.
[01:41:01.291 --> 01:41:02.232]  Thank you for the call, Harry.
[01:41:02.232 --> 01:41:03.413]  Great points.
[01:41:03.413 --> 01:41:03.853]  Let's jam in.
[01:41:03.853 --> 01:41:05.754]  Matt, you've got about a minute and 50 seconds.
[01:41:05.754 --> 01:41:07.295]  Go ahead.
[01:41:07.295 --> 01:41:09.217]  Yeah, man, what an honor.
[01:41:09.217 --> 01:41:10.477]  I appreciate the call.
[01:41:10.477 --> 01:41:26.169]  I had a friend and a buddy of mine were watching interviews with Ted Gilman and Ted Gunnarsson, and he was specifically talking on all of the ways that they address certain issues to neutralize them, all the bombs and such.
[01:41:26.169 --> 01:41:30.932]  And you've got the Nord Stream Pipeline, you've got all the farms, all of everything blowing up.
[01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:43.653]  And I just, he's specifically speaking on the New World Order, I just thought it was interesting how even back... Yeah, 25, 30, 40 years ago Ted Gunderson predicted everything they're doing now.
[01:41:43.653 --> 01:41:54.155]  Well yeah, and Chip Tatum in particular, I mean, Attorney Barr, we saw the picture the other day with Pelosi at JFK, they've all been in and doing, and involved
[01:41:56.559 --> 01:41:57.880]  I gotta let you go, Matt.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.062]  Your phone's been fading where I can only hear half of what you're saying.
[01:42:00.062 --> 01:42:00.843]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:00.843 --> 01:42:03.446]  Alright, we're gonna go to break.
[01:42:03.446 --> 01:42:07.410]  And we're gonna come back with your phone calls, but I'm gonna hit this dollar news first.
[01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:08.230]  Show.
[01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:08.591]  Zappy.
[01:42:09.918 --> 01:42:11.159]  Everybody else, get ready.
[01:42:11.159 --> 01:42:12.980]  We're going to your calls right after this break.
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:16.462]  Robert, Mark, Craig, Cecilia, you're up next, actually.
[01:42:16.462 --> 01:42:19.905]  Bring it to all your calls straight ahead on this live Monday edition.
[01:42:19.905 --> 01:42:23.167]  But yes, they're cutting off the resources.
[01:42:23.167 --> 01:42:26.929]  They're trying to ban rice and cut trees down and ban cows.
[01:42:26.929 --> 01:42:28.631]  I mean, they're doing it.
[01:42:28.631 --> 01:42:29.951]  It's crazy.
[01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:33.053]  And we've got to get control of our governments and stop this.
[01:42:33.053 --> 01:42:33.714]  And we are.
[01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.635]  More and more people are opposing it.
[01:42:35.635 --> 01:42:37.617]  More and more people are waking up.
[01:42:37.617 --> 01:42:39.578]  So as negative as things are,
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.923]  We're in a very positive position when it comes to waking up.
[01:42:44.923 --> 01:42:50.830]  So, nobody should say the future is not incredibly interesting because it is.
[01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:53.252]  It is so riveting what's happening.
[01:42:53.252 --> 01:42:55.154]  How could anybody turn their eyes away from it?
[01:42:55.154 --> 01:42:57.277]  I mean, it is just an incredible time to be alive.
[01:42:59.609 --> 01:43:03.533]  1776 Testosterone Boost is back in stock.
[01:43:03.533 --> 01:43:09.699]  It is a private label of the number one best-selling natural testosterone booster on the market.
[01:43:09.699 --> 01:43:13.522]  It does incredible things for men, but women also love it.
[01:43:13.522 --> 01:43:17.546]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to experience this product for yourself.
[01:43:17.546 --> 01:43:20.849]  I never have any issues in the libido department.
[01:43:21.249 --> 01:43:26.115]  But it's always good to supercharge it and take it to the next level.
[01:43:26.115 --> 01:43:30.821]  And I'm just going to tell you, bottom line, my wife is blown away.
[01:43:30.821 --> 01:43:34.525]  I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the sheets.
[01:43:34.525 --> 01:43:38.250]  I'm telling you, at 49, I've got more energy
[01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:38.950]  I think so.

[01:44:12.349 --> 01:44:14.570]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[01:46:01.837 --> 01:46:06.718]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:46:06.718 --> 01:46:12.020]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:05.874]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.365 --> 01:47:22.746]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[01:47:22.746 --> 01:47:24.947]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[01:47:24.947 --> 01:47:30.028]  Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
[01:47:30.028 --> 01:47:33.229]  I fought with the devil.
[01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:35.889]  I fought with the devil.
[01:47:35.889 --> 01:47:38.570]  Got down on his level.
[01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:41.751]  But I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[01:47:46.415 --> 01:47:57.019]  You know it's a great feeling metaphysically when the devil quits going after you and trying to get you to join him and instead attacks you.
[01:47:57.019 --> 01:47:59.720]  That's a line I crossed probably 20 years ago.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.101]  You can feel it when you cross it.
[01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:08.864]  Crucified by lovers but through it all I withstood the pain.
[01:48:11.893 --> 01:48:20.038]  I'm no stranger to the rain When I get that foggy feelin' What am I feelin' now?
[01:48:20.038 --> 01:48:36.388]  If I don't keep my head, I may drown But it's hard to keep believin' I'll even come out evenin' While the rain beats a hole in the ground
[01:48:38.556 --> 01:48:40.537]  Hey, Mr. Jones, can you hear me okay?
[01:48:40.537 --> 01:48:40.958]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:40.958 --> 01:48:44.840]  You wanna talk about the zombie bird drums?
[01:48:57.719 --> 01:48:58.440]  Yes, yes.
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.242]  I think this is in relation to Nikola Tesla technology.
[01:49:02.242 --> 01:49:04.443]  He was the first to invent drones in 1898.
[01:49:04.443 --> 01:49:07.505]  Well, let's start over, because I covered that first hour.
[01:49:07.505 --> 01:49:09.666]  New listeners are like, what the hell are they talking about?
[01:49:09.666 --> 01:49:15.990]  Mainstream news, top of drudge, reanimated birds turn into drones, dead birds turn into drones.
[01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:18.552]  Tell them about it.
[01:49:18.552 --> 01:49:26.817]  Yeah, I think there has been like a bird shaped drone technology in use for a long time, and these drones are
[01:49:27.267 --> 01:49:30.669]  Powered wirelessly through electricity.
[01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:35.192]  If you look on YouTube, weird things flying in the Milwaukee sky.
[01:49:35.192 --> 01:49:48.401]  There's a 32 second clip of like 50 UFOs flying over a power plant in Milwaukee and they like start glowing, flying in formation and disappear about from five years ago and anyone who's lived in Milwaukee
[01:49:48.897 --> 01:49:51.879]  Long enough has seen these like bird-like drones.
[01:49:51.879 --> 01:49:53.400]  I've seen them before with witnesses.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:58.282]  I remember like 15 years ago, everybody said they saw like huge dragonflies in D.C.
[01:49:58.282 --> 01:50:00.324]  spying on an anti-war protest.
[01:50:00.324 --> 01:50:02.845]  Turned out it was a CIA test.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:06.567]  They were robot insects.
[01:50:06.567 --> 01:50:13.711]  Yeah, and it makes sense, you know, like for covert reasons to have drones that people would think like, oh, that's just the bird, you know.
[01:50:13.711 --> 01:50:18.054]  And in 1898, Nikola Tesla came up with the first drone
[01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:19.029]  Thank you.
[01:50:37.642 --> 01:50:44.084]  Yeah, I mean, I think Tesla was a super genius way beyond Thomas Edison, but he kind of gave us 5G.
[01:50:44.084 --> 01:50:49.346]  I think it's a horrible idea to have giant broadcasting power everywhere that gives us cancer.
[01:50:49.346 --> 01:50:50.527]  So everything has power remotely.
[01:50:50.527 --> 01:50:51.987]  I think it's horrible.
[01:50:51.987 --> 01:50:52.688]  Yes, yes.
[01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:58.050]  And he but he specifically talked that, hey, you can't use certain frequencies because they'll get you sick and give you cancer.
[01:50:58.050 --> 01:51:07.013]  So you have to use specific frequencies and amplitudes and types of energy that are in sync with humanity to the point that you can actually
[01:51:07.543 --> 01:51:10.184]  You know, improve your body.
[01:51:10.184 --> 01:51:18.749]  And he would sit in an electronic field that he would tune to his brain and read books and it would stimulate his creativity and connection to God.
[01:51:18.749 --> 01:51:23.372]  So I think it's just bastardization of Nikola Tesla's technology.
[01:51:23.372 --> 01:51:26.894]  You know, what can be used for good can also be used for evil.
[01:51:26.894 --> 01:51:27.854]  No, I think you're right.
[01:51:27.854 --> 01:51:29.015]  I'm going to jump to the next caller.
[01:51:29.015 --> 01:51:30.075]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:30.075 --> 01:51:35.799]  Here's a photo of Nikola Tesla in one of his chambers, the electricity all around him.
[01:51:36.618 --> 01:51:38.079]  Hi Alex, this is also a call about Africa.
[01:51:38.079 --> 01:51:42.540]  I have a friend who's living in South Africa and she said at certain times they're down to about
[01:51:57.568 --> 01:52:01.011]  So I also think a way when you talk about global control, I also think that chaos is also a way of control.
[01:52:17.978 --> 01:52:25.484]  So one of the things that, for instance, they did bring in this Andre de Reuters to run the electrical power company.
[01:52:25.484 --> 01:52:42.578]  And recently, I mean, his most his latest initiative was to deal with some of the staffing because he had a lot of people on staff who were just, you know, holding a position because South Africa has race based hiring.
[01:52:42.578 --> 01:52:45.200]  They have the black economic empowerment.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:46.501]  So he put in a
[01:52:48.351 --> 01:52:49.112]  Thank you.
[01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:09.035]  Right.
[01:53:09.035 --> 01:53:09.435]  You're right.
[01:53:09.435 --> 01:53:11.016]  Crime is up 10,000 percent.
[01:53:11.016 --> 01:53:12.377]  Mass murder, death.
[01:53:12.377 --> 01:53:13.878]  And it's all internationally run.
[01:53:13.878 --> 01:53:16.760]  It's so sad for the average person in South Africa, black or white.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.800]  And that's the plan for here.
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.681]  You're absolutely right.
[01:53:18.681 --> 01:53:19.902]  The globalists want control.
[01:53:19.902 --> 01:53:23.764]  They bring in chaos so things collapse so they get control.
[01:53:23.764 --> 01:53:24.304]  Yes.
[01:53:24.304 --> 01:53:28.467]  And it'd be great if you could bring Simon Roche back on your show.
[01:53:28.467 --> 01:53:31.129]  I know you've had him on before just to talk about what's going on there.
[01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:34.831]  We should get Simon Roche back on with the Afrikaners to get an update on Africa.
[01:53:34.831 --> 01:53:35.652]  Yeah, the Sightlanders.
[01:53:36.323 --> 01:53:36.683]  Yep.
[01:53:36.683 --> 01:53:37.064]  All right.
[01:53:37.064 --> 01:53:38.225]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:53:38.225 --> 01:53:39.466]  Another amazing call.
[01:53:39.466 --> 01:53:40.066]  Moving quick.
[01:53:40.066 --> 01:53:41.187]  Jacob in Nebraska.
[01:53:41.187 --> 01:53:43.269]  You're on the air.
[01:53:43.269 --> 01:53:44.009]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:53:44.009 --> 01:53:44.870]  Thank you for having me.
[01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:45.851]  God bless you, sir.
[01:53:45.851 --> 01:53:47.853]  God bless you.
[01:53:47.853 --> 01:53:52.837]  First of all, everyone needs to go to InfoWars.com and get whatever product they want.
[01:53:52.837 --> 01:53:54.858]  If you're sleeping on it, now's the time.
[01:53:54.858 --> 01:53:57.661]  So thanks for taking my call.
[01:53:57.661 --> 01:54:01.384]  I'm the leader of a band here called Consider the Beast in Nebraska.
[01:54:01.384 --> 01:54:05.187]  We're a very conservative area, but the music scene is very liberal.
[01:54:06.144 --> 01:54:09.206]  And I see them supporting trans violence.
[01:54:09.206 --> 01:54:11.367]  And yeah, it's just a very toxic scene.
[01:54:11.367 --> 01:54:14.649]  So some prayers in this area of the country.
[01:54:14.649 --> 01:54:18.811]  Yeah, I mean, my wife's from Nebraska and I've been with her for nine years.
[01:54:18.811 --> 01:54:20.352]  And so I've been going up there for nine years.
[01:54:20.352 --> 01:54:22.213]  We've been married almost seven.
[01:54:22.213 --> 01:54:24.454]  And it was totally normal until about three years ago.
[01:54:24.454 --> 01:54:29.217]  And you go anywhere, there's like trans marches and men in dresses everywhere and just crime.
[01:54:29.217 --> 01:54:30.758]  And it just it's totally leftist.
[01:54:32.793 --> 01:54:38.455]  Yeah, it got so bad that even Trump's people wouldn't come here to see our governor.
[01:54:38.455 --> 01:54:42.516]  How did they turn it into such a weirdo hellhole in just a few years?
[01:54:42.516 --> 01:54:45.417]  I mean, I've been there three or four times since this happened.
[01:54:45.417 --> 01:54:50.239]  I've been there like once a year at least, and it's totally changed.
[01:54:50.239 --> 01:54:51.219]  That's a good question.
[01:54:51.219 --> 01:55:00.662]  I think they put up a couple of these bars around town and the nightlife here, it's a college town, so it's pretty lively, you know, young kids.
[01:55:02.093 --> 01:55:12.695]  I almost got funneled into the scene, but thankfully, by the hand of God, we were saved from it, and we want to spread his word with our band.
[01:55:12.695 --> 01:55:13.035]  Exactly.
[01:55:13.035 --> 01:55:17.076]  They're targeting the elementary, the middle school, the high school, and the college students.
[01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:20.017]  They want the future to do this so you don't have children.
[01:55:20.017 --> 01:55:31.139]  But I want to talk about Elon Musk, and there's a name of a woman that everyone needs to know, and I saw her from Casey Cusick's podcast, The Watchman, and he's great.
[01:55:32.322 --> 01:55:35.164]  Her name is Jessie Saboder.
[01:55:35.164 --> 01:55:41.467]  Her last name is spelled C-Z-E-D-O-T-A-R.
[01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:48.151]  Her name is Jessie Saboder, and she is a part of the Cullen Bloodline.
[01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:54.515]  The CIA.gov website has a paper called the Illuminati Bloodlines, Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[01:55:54.515 --> 01:55:56.336]  You can read this.
[01:55:56.336 --> 01:56:00.398]  She talks about all the inside baseball on the Luciferian Brotherhood.
[01:56:01.534 --> 01:56:04.215]  She was in it from an early age.
[01:56:04.215 --> 01:56:07.837]  She's the successor to the throne of the Queen Mother of Darkness.
[01:56:07.837 --> 01:56:08.837]  Yeah, listen, listen.
[01:56:08.837 --> 01:56:11.958]  I mean, I know about Fritz Springmeier and I like him and I know about all that stuff.
[01:56:11.958 --> 01:56:13.859]  But we have the Globalist out in the open with their program.
[01:56:13.859 --> 01:56:18.081]  There's all these people that claim they're secretly this, they're secretly that.
[01:56:18.081 --> 01:56:20.442]  And to me, it's just kind of a speculationary.
[01:56:20.442 --> 01:56:21.522]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:21.522 --> 01:56:22.743]  Because everybody just go off.
[01:56:22.743 --> 01:56:24.263]  This woman says she's that.
[01:56:24.263 --> 01:56:27.344]  You can turn the news on and they're just doing all this horrible stuff.
[01:56:27.344 --> 01:56:28.465]  But I will definitely look into that.
[01:56:29.065 --> 01:56:29.685]  I've heard of that.
[01:56:29.685 --> 01:56:31.146]  I know about the Collins Bloodline.
[01:56:31.146 --> 01:56:31.806]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:31.806 --> 01:56:33.027]  All right, we're starting the next hour.
[01:56:33.027 --> 01:56:35.348]  We're going to get to all the other callers.
[01:56:35.348 --> 01:56:37.409]  Let me do a plug here real quick.
[01:56:37.409 --> 01:56:41.670]  TurboForce was our number one best-selling product until it sold out eight months ago.
[01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:47.213]  Clean, incredible 10-hour energy, all the amino acids, all the natural stimulants, it's all in there.
[01:56:47.213 --> 01:56:49.053]  It's over-the-top and it funds the broadcast.
[01:56:49.053 --> 01:56:53.295]  Back in stock, 25% off TurboForce and back in stock, 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:56:55.256 --> 01:56:55.756]  We're good to go.
[01:57:17.854 --> 01:57:21.135]  Also, we have the Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, even stronger.
[01:57:21.135 --> 01:57:24.576]  What it does for your joints, your bones, your immune system, it's next level.
[01:57:24.576 --> 01:57:26.916]  And this version of it even tastes better.
[01:57:26.916 --> 01:57:27.717]  It's amazing.
[01:57:27.717 --> 01:57:28.837]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:28.837 --> 01:57:31.277]  Ultimate Bone Broth and so much more.
[01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:33.038]  The prebiotics, back in stock.
[01:57:33.038 --> 01:57:34.538]  Wow, you should definitely check that out.
[01:57:34.538 --> 01:57:36.159]  Get some t-shirts while you're at it.
[01:57:36.159 --> 01:57:37.459]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:37.459 --> 01:57:39.600]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.320]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:43.000]  We're making straight donation.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.141]  You who are keeping us on air, I thank you.
[01:57:49.502 --> 01:57:56.151]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:57:56.151 --> 01:57:58.074]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:57:58.074 --> 01:57:59.596]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:57:59.596 --> 01:58:02.379]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:58:02.379 --> 01:58:04.402]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:58:05.183 --> 01:58:07.144]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:58:07.144 --> 01:58:09.586]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:58:09.586 --> 01:58:11.727]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:58:11.727 --> 01:58:18.312]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[01:58:18.312 --> 01:58:19.373]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:58:19.373 --> 01:58:23.495]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:58:23.495 --> 01:58:25.096]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:58:25.096 --> 01:58:26.117]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:58:26.117 --> 01:58:28.679]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:58:28.679 --> 01:58:29.459]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:58:29.459 --> 01:58:30.340]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:58:31.241 --> 01:58:33.863]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited-edition shirt.
[01:58:33.863 --> 01:58:35.745]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:58:35.745 --> 01:58:45.013]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:49.144 --> 01:58:54.847]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[01:58:54.847 --> 01:58:57.528]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:58:57.528 --> 01:59:00.150]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[01:59:00.150 --> 01:59:00.890]  Period.
[01:59:00.890 --> 01:59:01.991]  Case closed.
[01:59:01.991 --> 01:59:03.352]  Out to get you and your family.
[01:59:03.352 --> 01:59:03.912]  We sell.
[01:59:04.352 --> 01:59:11.639]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:59:11.639 --> 01:59:19.185]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[01:59:20.026 --> 01:59:24.388]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:59:24.388 --> 01:59:25.929]  But you can go paint two or three times.
[01:59:25.929 --> 01:59:28.731]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:59:28.731 --> 01:59:33.953]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[01:59:33.953 --> 01:59:39.416]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:59:39.416 --> 01:59:41.077]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:59:41.077 --> 01:59:42.658]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:59:42.658 --> 01:59:44.198]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:59:44.198 --> 01:59:46.780]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:47.960]  They're discounted right now.
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:48.701]  Finally back in stock.
[01:59:50.549 --> 02:00:00.675]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:00.675 --> 02:00:02.656]  Alright!
[02:00:04.105 --> 02:00:16.127]  I want to play this clip because the last caller, the caller before last reminded me of this, where you have these esoteric documents and things that are out there.
[02:00:16.127 --> 02:00:18.628]  People say, well, are they real or are they not?
[02:00:18.628 --> 02:00:20.568]  Well, what the globalists are doing is real.
[02:00:20.568 --> 02:00:24.409]  So did somebody fictionally write this up as their plan to try to warn people?
[02:00:24.409 --> 02:00:26.429]  Because it is what's happening.
[02:00:26.429 --> 02:00:27.289]  I don't know.
[02:00:27.289 --> 02:00:29.710]  But I know the things the globalists write that we source here.
[02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:34.912]  Like I said, Part Memorandum 200 and others actually talk about forced depopulation.
[02:00:34.912 --> 02:00:37.753]  So the full video is seven and a half minutes long.
[02:00:37.753 --> 02:00:39.434]  I have it posted at Infowars.com.
[02:00:39.434 --> 02:00:41.194]  Here's about four or five minutes of it.
[02:00:41.194 --> 02:00:44.676]  This is Tanya the herbalist talks about the secret covenant.
[02:00:44.676 --> 02:00:46.076]  Is this real about the Rockefellers?
[02:00:46.076 --> 02:00:48.417]  Well, this is what they really did.
[02:00:48.417 --> 02:00:51.599]  So yes, it's real, but is this someone's fictional account of it?
[02:00:51.599 --> 02:00:51.919]  Here it is.
[02:00:53.490 --> 02:00:57.992]  You guys, I want to share with you the secret covenant that you might or might not have heard about.
[02:00:57.992 --> 02:01:04.456]  The secret covenant was created by none other than the Rockefellers and maybe even someone even higher than them, let's be honest.
[02:01:04.456 --> 02:01:08.217]  But this is their secret covenant and their clause of things that they wanted to follow.
[02:01:08.217 --> 02:01:15.881]  And if you're a conspiracy theorist or a critical thinker and you're aware of what's been going on in the world, you're going to know exactly how suitable this is.
[02:01:15.881 --> 02:01:18.262]  This is written word for word and I want to read it to you.
[02:01:18.262 --> 02:01:19.163]  Okay, so bear with me.
[02:01:20.305 --> 02:01:26.047]  The Secret Covenant, an illusion that will be so large, so vast, it will escape their perception.
[02:01:26.047 --> 02:01:29.108]  Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.
[02:01:29.108 --> 02:01:33.489]  We'll create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us.
[02:01:33.489 --> 02:01:36.530]  We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive.
[02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:41.972]  Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves.
[02:01:41.972 --> 02:01:44.513]  This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur.
[02:01:45.882 --> 02:01:51.223]  We will always stand above the relative field of their experience, for we know the secrets of the absolute.
[02:01:51.223 --> 02:01:54.724]  We will work together always, and we will remain bound by blood and secrecy.
[02:01:54.724 --> 02:01:58.065]  Death will come to he who speaks.
[02:01:58.065 --> 02:02:01.906]  We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite.
[02:02:01.906 --> 02:02:06.928]  We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so that they will never see what's happening.
[02:02:06.928 --> 02:02:12.209]  We will use soft metals, aging accelerators, and sedatives in food and water, also in the air.
[02:02:12.209 --> 02:02:14.490]  They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.
[02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:18.243]  The soft metals will cause them to lose their mind.
[02:02:18.243 --> 02:02:24.187]  We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison.
[02:02:24.187 --> 02:02:29.391]  The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths, and they will destroy their minds and reproductive system.
[02:02:29.391 --> 02:02:33.495]  From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information.
[02:02:33.495 --> 02:02:39.179]  The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe, and wear.
[02:02:39.179 --> 02:02:42.502]  We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons, for they can see far.
[02:02:43.424 --> 02:02:47.248]  We will teach them that the poisons are good with fun images and musical tones.
[02:02:47.248 --> 02:02:48.889]  Those they look up to will help.
[02:02:48.889 --> 02:02:51.411]  We will enlist them to push our poisons.
[02:02:51.411 --> 02:02:58.258]  They will see our products being used in the film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect.
[02:02:58.258 --> 02:03:03.242]  When they give birth, we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them that it's for their help.
[02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:05.224]  We will start early on when their minds are young.
[02:03:05.224 --> 02:03:08.327]  We will target their children with what the children love most, sweet things.
[02:03:09.568 --> 02:03:13.751]  When their teeth decay, we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future.
[02:03:13.751 --> 02:03:21.637]  When their ability to learn has been affected, we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other diseases for which we will create yet more medicine.
[02:03:21.637 --> 02:03:25.039]  We will render them docile and weak before us by our power.
[02:03:25.039 --> 02:03:27.541]  They will go depressed, slow, and obese.
[02:03:27.541 --> 02:03:29.703]  And when they come to us for help, we will give them more poison.
[02:03:31.243 --> 02:03:38.569]  We will focus their attention toward money and material goods so that they many never connect with their inner self.
[02:03:38.569 --> 02:03:45.314]  We will distract them with fornication, external pleasures, and games so that they may never be one with the oneness of it all.
[02:03:45.314 --> 02:03:47.696]  Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say.
[02:03:47.696 --> 02:03:52.220]  If they refuse, we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives.
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:54.942]  We will use fear as our weapon.
[02:03:54.942 --> 02:03:57.604]  We will establish the governments and establish opposites within.
[02:03:57.604 --> 02:03:58.805]  We will own both sides.
[02:04:00.077 --> 02:04:02.820]  We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan.
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:06.203]  They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil.
[02:04:06.203 --> 02:04:08.165]  Our families will never mix with theirs.
[02:04:08.165 --> 02:04:11.568]  Our blood must be always pure, for it is the way.
[02:04:11.568 --> 02:04:13.390]  We will make them kill each other when it suits us.
[02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:16.172]  We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.
[02:04:16.172 --> 02:04:19.716]  We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.
[02:04:19.716 --> 02:04:23.119]  We will grow them kindly and gently, letting them think that they are guiding themselves.
[02:04:25.336 --> 02:04:28.438]  We will foment animosity between them through our factions.
[02:04:28.438 --> 02:04:33.320]  When a light shall shine among them, we shall extinguish it by ridicule or death, whichever suits it best.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:36.561]  We will make them rip each other's hearts apart and kill their own children.
[02:04:36.561 --> 02:04:40.924]  We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.
[02:04:40.924 --> 02:04:46.486]  The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers.
[02:04:46.486 --> 02:04:47.807]  They will be busy killing each other.
[02:04:48.442 --> 02:04:52.291]  They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit.
[02:04:52.291 --> 02:04:56.882]  We will benefit greatly from this for they will not see us for they cannot see us.
[02:04:56.882 --> 02:04:58.486]  We will continue to prosper from their...
[02:05:07.854 --> 02:05:16.560]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:18.742]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[02:05:18.742 --> 02:05:31.711]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes, and again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:05:31.971 --> 02:05:32.871]  We're good to go!
[02:05:59.457 --> 02:06:04.863]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:04.863 --> 02:06:10.169]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.656 --> 02:06:24.460]  We are now into our number three on this live Monday edition.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:28.802]  We're going right back to your phone calls, but first I wanted to hit this report.
[02:06:28.802 --> 02:06:30.343]  This was put on national TV.
[02:06:30.343 --> 02:06:32.004]  It's been promoted a lot.
[02:06:32.004 --> 02:06:35.086]  We see these Lepus parents all over the country.
[02:06:35.086 --> 02:06:38.188]  We see government officials at the national
[02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:46.303]  Health Department at the Health and Human Services saying, we know when a baby's born whether they're transgender or not.
[02:06:46.303 --> 02:06:47.604]  So the child never has a chance.
[02:06:47.604 --> 02:06:48.265]  They're confused.
[02:06:48.265 --> 02:06:49.165]  They're told this, this.
[02:06:49.165 --> 02:06:50.526]  They trust their parents.
[02:06:50.526 --> 02:06:51.307]  They trust the school.
[02:06:51.307 --> 02:06:51.727]  This happens.
[02:06:51.727 --> 02:06:59.393]  Imagine being a three-year-old and your father says you're really a girl and you'll never be a boy.
[02:06:59.393 --> 02:07:04.256]  And then they force the transition and line you up to be mutilated and all this happened.
[02:07:04.256 --> 02:07:08.799]  How does that differ from John and Lorraine Bobbitt?
[02:07:08.799 --> 02:07:09.660]  Remember when that happened?
[02:07:11.963 --> 02:07:17.686]  In 1993, where she was mad at him so she cut his penis off?
[02:07:17.686 --> 02:07:20.187]  See, that's seen as a crime.
[02:07:20.187 --> 02:07:26.090]  But when a father does it to his son, with the medical system, the establishment, it's liberal and it's loving.
[02:07:26.090 --> 02:07:27.331]  Elon Musk is right.
[02:07:27.331 --> 02:07:30.933]  Prison time for anybody that does this to a minor.
[02:07:30.933 --> 02:07:36.296]  I believe in people having freedom, so no taxpayer should pay for it, but if you're 18 and want to cut your testicles off,
[02:07:37.165 --> 02:07:38.591]  That's your business.
[02:07:38.591 --> 02:07:42.446]  So here's this disgusting club, and then we'll go back to your calls.
[02:07:43.339 --> 02:07:51.363]  Basically, at about 24 months, here's where she started grabbing the tutus and the dresses.
[02:07:51.363 --> 02:07:54.885]  By three and a half, Kieran had transitioned to a girl.
[02:07:54.885 --> 02:07:58.848]  Today, she's nine years old, a third grader, and an athlete.
[02:07:58.848 --> 02:08:02.570]  That's why the Claussens are celebrating Governor Holcomb's decision to veto a bill.
[02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:04.651]  By the way, hit pause and back to sleep again.
[02:08:04.651 --> 02:08:07.953]  He lays out tutus, he lays out toys, oh!
[02:08:07.953 --> 02:08:09.914]  And then shows them, obviously, how to put on.
[02:08:10.794 --> 02:08:11.434]  The tutu.
[02:08:11.434 --> 02:08:14.915]  Well, you put a tutu on, you're a girl.
[02:08:14.915 --> 02:08:16.636]  Well, I mean, I've got a son who's 20.
[02:08:16.636 --> 02:08:17.736]  Super masculine.
[02:08:17.736 --> 02:08:22.518]  If I put out tutus and stuff and told him to put them on when he was two years old, he'd have done it.
[02:08:22.518 --> 02:08:24.278]  He said, two years old.
[02:08:24.278 --> 02:08:26.539]  27 months.
[02:08:26.539 --> 02:08:30.460]  It's like putting purses out and Barbie dolls.
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:33.581]  Oh, my two-year-old picked up a Barbie doll.
[02:08:33.581 --> 02:08:34.422]  Well, that's it.
[02:08:34.422 --> 02:08:35.242]  You're a girl.
[02:08:35.242 --> 02:08:36.422]  But here's the great part.
[02:08:36.422 --> 02:08:37.663]  She's an athlete.
[02:08:37.663 --> 02:08:38.503]  Oh, I bet.
[02:08:40.515 --> 02:08:44.439]  The boy is really doing well in girls sports at age 9.
[02:08:44.439 --> 02:08:49.944]  This is a fetish.
[02:08:49.944 --> 02:08:50.625]  It's a cult.
[02:08:50.625 --> 02:08:51.566]  It's sick.
[02:08:51.566 --> 02:08:52.407]  Start it over and play it.
[02:08:53.342 --> 02:09:01.347]  Basically, at about 24 months, here's where she started grabbing the tutus and the dresses.
[02:09:01.347 --> 02:09:04.869]  By three and a half, Kieran had transitioned to a girl.
[02:09:04.869 --> 02:09:09.672]  Today, she's nine years old, a third grader, and an athlete.
[02:09:09.672 --> 02:09:15.155]  The guy's wearing a Pete Buttigieg shirt.
[02:09:15.155 --> 02:09:16.556]  Oh, this guy adopted this girl?
[02:09:16.556 --> 02:09:20.619]  I mean, I'm just... Folks, this is what... Imagine what you're seeing here.
[02:09:21.991 --> 02:09:23.852]  I said 27 months, sorry, 24 months.
[02:09:23.852 --> 02:09:33.677]  So at 2 years old, you're laying out tutus, and then you're joking around, and your kid puts it on, well that's it!
[02:09:33.677 --> 02:09:36.819]  You put on a tutu!
[02:09:36.819 --> 02:09:43.903]  I guess in Up and Smoke, when Cheech puts on the tutu, and plays the guitar, well he must be a girl too.
[02:09:43.903 --> 02:09:48.406]  This one, Bob Hope dressed up like a girl, he's a girl too, let's cut his dick off.
[02:09:48.406 --> 02:09:50.847]  I'm going to stop interrupting because I want to go to your calls, just play the club.
[02:09:51.547 --> 02:09:59.072]  Basically, at about 24 months, here's where she started grabbing the tutus and the dresses.
[02:10:22.347 --> 02:10:23.368]  Hit pause again.
[02:10:23.368 --> 02:10:26.429]  So they brainwashed this child as their human shield.
[02:10:26.429 --> 02:10:28.290]  You think the Muslims are bad?
[02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:31.511]  You know, strapping them in with TNT.
[02:10:31.511 --> 02:10:40.855]  They've grabbed this child, brainwashed it, and now this person thinks they're a girl and doesn't want to be taken out of the sports where he's dominating.
[02:10:40.855 --> 02:10:41.595]  It's a little boy!
[02:10:41.595 --> 02:10:43.016]  With purple hair!
[02:10:44.701 --> 02:10:48.709]  And it's the set piece for the left to feel superior and powerful.
[02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:51.395]  I mean, it's so sick.
[02:10:51.395 --> 02:10:53.419]  Oh, she's crying.
[02:10:53.419 --> 02:10:54.942]  The governor protected her.
[02:10:58.085 --> 02:11:08.171]  There were happy tears shed, there was dancing, and when I told Kieran, she squealed with glee.
[02:11:08.171 --> 02:11:22.699]  There are people watching this right now who will say, people who were born a boy and are living life as a girl are biologically different, so it places them at an unfair advantage.
[02:11:22.699 --> 02:11:23.480]  My daughter
[02:11:25.317 --> 02:11:29.678]  Will never go through male puberty.
[02:11:29.678 --> 02:11:34.780]  He says Kieran will undergo hormone therapy to make her no different than any other girl.
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:41.582]  My kid's mental health is more important than your kid's trophy.
[02:11:41.582 --> 02:11:44.223]  Wow.
[02:11:44.223 --> 02:11:45.803]  Wow.
[02:11:45.803 --> 02:11:48.004]  Well that guy gives Brian Stelter a run for his money.
[02:11:49.212 --> 02:11:51.313]  You notice he's in charge.
[02:11:51.313 --> 02:11:53.874]  My son will never hit puberty.
[02:11:53.874 --> 02:11:59.696]  The bones are different, the blood, the RNA, the X's and the Y's, it's all different.
[02:11:59.696 --> 02:12:05.499]  But that's it, it's adults doing this to their children because they're part of the sick cult.
[02:12:05.499 --> 02:12:11.361]  My daughter will never hit male puberty and they never had a choice because you were
[02:12:12.867 --> 02:12:15.569]  Your son was two years old.
[02:12:15.569 --> 02:12:21.593]  You led him and his future and his biology and his role to a slaughter.
[02:12:21.593 --> 02:12:23.034]  And I agree with Elon Musk.
[02:12:23.034 --> 02:12:31.680]  If you're successful with those puberty blockers or having your son's genitals removed, you deserve to be in prison for life.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:37.644]  Disgusting, evil, wrong, and a cult coming after our children to confuse them.
[02:12:37.644 --> 02:12:40.986]  Yeah, might as well throw your child into a wood chipper.
[02:12:42.438 --> 02:12:45.440]  In my view.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:48.963]  But look at that guy's eyes, man.
[02:12:48.963 --> 02:12:52.165]  He is in the cult.
[02:12:52.165 --> 02:12:54.447]  All right.
[02:12:54.447 --> 02:12:55.748]  Let's go to Robert in Colorado.
[02:12:55.748 --> 02:12:56.368]  Robert, you're on here.
[02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:57.629]  Go ahead.
[02:12:57.629 --> 02:12:58.450]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:58.450 --> 02:13:02.273]  This is your old San Castro building buddy from Siesta Key.
[02:13:02.273 --> 02:13:04.154]  We met there this year at Thanksgiving.
[02:13:04.154 --> 02:13:05.155]  It was great.
[02:13:05.155 --> 02:13:11.460]  Listen, one thing that I really want to address, which drives me crazy, is this whole Wednesday Biden
[02:13:12.543 --> 02:13:18.966]  Yeah, so I used to live in Chicago, and that city now has lost six of the biggest corporations in the world.
[02:13:40.457 --> 02:13:43.338]  And that's how you take America down?
[02:13:43.338 --> 02:13:45.858]  Yeah, giant riots over the weekend.
[02:13:45.858 --> 02:13:47.018]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:48.138]  And the mayor loves it.
[02:13:48.138 --> 02:13:49.679]  The mayor loves it.
[02:13:49.679 --> 02:13:52.759]  Oh, they just double down on it, really.
[02:13:52.759 --> 02:13:53.199]  Right.
[02:13:53.199 --> 02:13:57.580]  Yeah, this guy is worse than Lightfoot, which is hard to do.
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:59.620]  It's hard to do, but they found a way.
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:08.222]  So, I mean, this whole lawlessness and, you know, I just, my thing I can't reconcile is, like, the leaders, whether they be state, federal,
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:17.122]  Everyone's like, when all those like videos you've been showing this morning about the future dystopian, it's like, do these people think they're going to be exempt from it?
[02:14:17.122 --> 02:14:21.523]  I just don't, I can't figure out their logic in like, telling a story to everyone.
[02:14:21.523 --> 02:14:22.183]  It's spiritual.
[02:14:22.183 --> 02:14:27.365]  They're perverts, they're weirdos, and they get off on destroying the energy of a child's future.
[02:14:27.365 --> 02:14:30.385]  So where else can they legally mutilate a child?
[02:14:30.385 --> 02:14:32.586]  Where else can they legally do this?
[02:14:32.586 --> 02:14:36.327]  They do it because it's protected by the system, and it's a fetish, they get off on it.
[02:14:38.055 --> 02:14:40.497]  Yeah, well then I can't address it when I get there.
[02:14:40.497 --> 02:14:41.698]  Look, look, look.
[02:14:41.698 --> 02:14:44.981]  Every ancient culture when it became corrupt sacrificed first born boys.
[02:14:44.981 --> 02:14:47.523]  So they did Ritalin, they did Prozac, they did it all to kill our boys.
[02:14:47.523 --> 02:14:48.064]  That didn't work.
[02:14:48.064 --> 02:14:49.665]  So now they're just going to cut their balls off.
[02:14:49.665 --> 02:14:51.286]  It's real simple.
[02:14:51.286 --> 02:14:54.970]  Yeah, so did they do that to that video you just played?
[02:14:54.970 --> 02:14:57.091]  That girl, quote unquote.
[02:14:57.091 --> 02:15:01.836]  Well, he pledges, he says, she will never go through puberty.
[02:15:01.836 --> 02:15:04.178]  So, he is nine.
[02:15:05.299 --> 02:15:09.182]  And the father is pledging that it doesn't matter.
[02:15:09.182 --> 02:15:15.506]  And long before his son can make a choice, he's been inducted into this hell.
[02:15:15.506 --> 02:15:16.667]  Yeah.
[02:15:16.667 --> 02:15:21.090]  Well, hopefully women and women athletes will start stepping up for the female cause because
[02:15:22.359 --> 02:15:25.500]  Going up against these athletes who are really men is ridiculous.
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:30.820]  Well sure, but the girls having their right to compete is stolen, is secondary, and it's wrong.
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:32.961]  These little boys and little girls being inducted into this.
[02:15:32.961 --> 02:15:34.501]  And you know, it's a social credit score.
[02:15:34.501 --> 02:15:35.601]  It's not official yet.
[02:15:35.601 --> 02:15:39.782]  This guy gets bonuses, jobs, everything, because he is in the cult.
[02:15:39.782 --> 02:15:41.442]  He gave his son over.
[02:15:41.442 --> 02:15:43.503]  He destroyed his son's future.
[02:15:43.503 --> 02:15:50.424]  He is going to biologically, before he's of age and decides to be castrated, going to do this chemically or surgically.
[02:15:50.424 --> 02:15:51.244]  And so this guy
[02:15:55.768 --> 02:16:02.515]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:16:02.515 --> 02:16:04.817]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:16:04.817 --> 02:16:08.761]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:16:08.761 --> 02:16:12.706]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:16:14.133 --> 02:16:17.675]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:16:17.675 --> 02:16:24.560]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.461]  It's really just incredible.
[02:16:26.488 --> 02:16:29.370]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:16:29.370 --> 02:16:35.916]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:16:35.916 --> 02:16:36.876]  I know you spread the word.
[02:16:36.876 --> 02:16:37.797]  I know you pray for us.
[02:16:37.797 --> 02:16:38.398]  That's wonderful.
[02:16:38.398 --> 02:16:38.958]  Keep doing it.
[02:16:38.958 --> 02:16:46.024]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:16:46.024 --> 02:16:47.185]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:16:47.885 --> 02:16:52.187]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[02:16:52.187 --> 02:16:57.130]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:16:57.130 --> 02:16:59.091]  Please take action now.
[02:16:59.091 --> 02:17:00.492]  InfoWars.
[02:17:00.492 --> 02:17:02.513]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:17:02.513 --> 02:17:04.254]  This is their big move.
[02:17:04.254 --> 02:17:08.056]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:17:08.056 --> 02:17:09.757]  He doesn't care.
[02:17:09.757 --> 02:17:11.018]  That's not his job.
[02:17:11.018 --> 02:17:12.758]  He's not the President of the United States.
[02:17:12.758 --> 02:17:15.320]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:17:16.607 --> 02:17:21.112]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:17:21.112 --> 02:17:22.254]  They must be opposed.
[02:17:22.847 --> 02:17:26.269]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:17:26.269 --> 02:17:27.449]  No.
[02:17:27.449 --> 02:17:28.290]  No.
[02:17:28.290 --> 02:17:29.070]  No.
[02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.950]  Exactly.
[02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:33.512]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:17:33.512 --> 02:17:36.613]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:17:36.613 --> 02:17:39.115]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:17:39.115 --> 02:17:41.596]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:17:41.596 --> 02:17:45.218]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:17:45.218 --> 02:17:47.739]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:17:47.739 --> 02:17:48.139]  You're right.
[02:17:48.419 --> 02:17:53.190]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:54.733]  And we say no to your war!
[02:17:58.536 --> 02:18:06.739]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:18:06.739 --> 02:18:08.180]  That is the hellish future.
[02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:17.603]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarshore.com.
[02:18:17.603 --> 02:18:23.185]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:18:23.185 --> 02:18:25.166]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:18:25.766 --> 02:18:31.150]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHorror.com.
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:35.093]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:18:35.093 --> 02:18:40.958]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:18:40.958 --> 02:18:43.060]  I'm gonna thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:44.400]  We're good to go.
[02:18:59.961 --> 02:19:09.672]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[02:19:09.672 --> 02:19:13.357]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[02:19:13.357 --> 02:19:20.305]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsTore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[02:19:20.825 --> 02:19:25.088]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[02:19:25.088 --> 02:19:27.830]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:30.092]  Nitric, boosts what it does for your heart.
[02:19:30.092 --> 02:19:31.833]  Cardiovascular, critical.
[02:19:31.833 --> 02:19:39.879]  All these products, like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Supermelt Vitality, they're all available and in stock, ready to ship to you, right down at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:39.879 --> 02:19:48.805]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[02:19:49.005 --> 02:19:51.446]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[02:19:51.446 --> 02:19:52.306]  We didn't have them for sale.
[02:19:52.306 --> 02:19:53.866]  But now, I signed the last books.
[02:19:53.866 --> 02:19:58.747]  You can get them right now.
[02:19:58.747 --> 02:20:09.689]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.689 --> 02:20:18.071]  You're on your phone calls here in a moment.
[02:20:20.968 --> 02:20:32.760]  But first, from the Alex Jones Show Monday edition, they remove Lightfoot and put someone in, even worse, a Black Lives Matter communist.
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:36.164]  This is a Town Hall article, there's links to the video, it's totally insane.
[02:20:36.164 --> 02:20:42.951]  Incoming mayor's statement about weekend riots, shootings, burnings, stores robbed, hundreds of youth attacking.
[02:20:44.338 --> 02:20:47.660]  Incoming Mayor's statement about weekend riots shows how much trouble Chicago's in.
[02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:48.040]  He said,
[02:21:04.778 --> 02:21:14.082]  So the city's completely collapsing, and he's saying people running around going psychotic and physically attacking any white person they see is a good thing.
[02:21:14.082 --> 02:21:22.285]  So this is the globalist turning the cities over to black racists to try to then organize black people to go out and commit crime, collapse America.
[02:21:22.285 --> 02:21:23.826]  It's all part of the larger plan.
[02:21:23.826 --> 02:21:26.187]  It's totally sick.
[02:21:26.187 --> 02:21:27.767]  All right, let's go to Mark in California.
[02:21:27.767 --> 02:21:28.227]  You're on the air.
[02:21:28.227 --> 02:21:28.708]  Thanks for holding.
[02:21:28.708 --> 02:21:30.368]  Then we'll go to Charlie in Puerto Rico.
[02:21:30.368 --> 02:21:32.249]  Hey, Alex.
[02:21:32.679 --> 02:21:43.424]  I'm calling about that crazy video you had on yesterday and it's sick, you know, and I'm in Los Angeles area here and it's unbelievable the amount of people we have here.
[02:21:43.424 --> 02:21:48.306]  We just don't see it possible for them to round everyone up and take them to the camp.
[02:21:48.306 --> 02:21:53.048]  So, you know, I have a feeling they're going to nuke bomb everybody.
[02:21:53.048 --> 02:21:54.609]  And, you know, who's building the camps?
[02:21:54.609 --> 02:21:58.871]  And can you give us a location of these camps in the United States?
[02:22:01.394 --> 02:22:06.536]  You know, this is something I need to make a short documentary about.
[02:22:06.536 --> 02:22:25.584]  I made four police state films on this, and I show all the historical records, the congressional records, I show all the documents, but were you watching the news in the last three-plus years where they built these emergency quarantine camps all over the world, including the U.S.? ?
[02:22:26.755 --> 02:22:29.877]  Yeah, I saw them, but I didn't see them built in the U.S.
[02:22:29.877 --> 02:22:41.565]  I saw them in China and, you know... Yeah, well, I've probably done 50 shows on this, so I'd be more than happy to pull all that up for you, but it's all UN-directed.
[02:22:41.565 --> 02:22:42.646]  I've played the UN hearings.
[02:22:43.806 --> 02:22:45.347]  Dr. Ryan, the head of the Global U.N.
[02:22:45.347 --> 02:22:50.029]  Emergency Response System, and they've got all sorts of U.S.
[02:22:50.029 --> 02:23:04.817]  military bases that have been designated for quarantine centers, major sports stadiums in every major city, designated as those people escaping out of them in China and Australia that was the vanguard of this.
[02:23:04.817 --> 02:23:08.359]  But absolutely, they have said their goal
[02:23:09.619 --> 02:23:10.720]  I don't have the document in front of me.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:11.641]  I forget the exact name of it.
[02:23:11.641 --> 02:23:14.063]  I probably covered it 50 times, but I'm not exaggerating.
[02:23:14.063 --> 02:23:17.065]  All right.
[02:23:17.065 --> 02:23:27.272]  Is a State Department document and a FEMA document and a CDC document that said, I forget the exact term, it talked about safe sectors.
[02:23:27.272 --> 02:23:32.595]  And it said they're just going to lock down neighborhoods and I'll let you leave your house and put the military outside of those.
[02:23:33.536 --> 02:23:40.643]  Where ever you see the camps, whether they're in Saudi Arabia or Italy or the UK or Canada, they're the same.
[02:23:40.643 --> 02:23:53.116]  And yes, they've built all sorts of FEMA, just type in FEMA emergency response, FEMA crisis relocation centers, FEMA emergency trailers.
[02:23:53.837 --> 02:23:55.659]  And they've got all over the country.
[02:23:55.659 --> 02:24:08.329]  I mean, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, New York, California, huge areas of military bases that look just like that with trailers.
[02:24:08.329 --> 02:24:12.232]  That's the older version of it is trailers with bars on the windows.
[02:24:12.232 --> 02:24:17.256]  These things are usually two to three stories tall is the new model globally.
[02:24:17.256 --> 02:24:19.999]  But yes, indeed, it was proposed.
[02:24:19.999 --> 02:24:20.999]  They talked about it here.
[02:24:20.999 --> 02:24:22.641]  There's CDC quarantine.
[02:24:24.244 --> 02:24:24.804]  Take the man up.
[02:24:24.804 --> 02:24:25.445]  There you go.
[02:24:25.445 --> 02:24:28.006]  CDC quarantine stations and their jurisdictions.
[02:24:28.006 --> 02:24:32.628]  So that is from the CDC website.
[02:24:32.628 --> 02:24:32.928]  U.S.
[02:24:32.928 --> 02:24:35.609]  crisis relocation planning.
[02:24:35.609 --> 02:24:39.291]  And there's a there's a there's a map from the government for you right there.
[02:24:40.313 --> 02:24:46.598]  My wife, Yann, she thinks she's just gonna sit in the house and arm herself when the school bus comes around to pick us up, you know what I mean?
[02:24:46.598 --> 02:24:51.001]  And I've got all the video in my films of the military training with school buses that do just this.
[02:24:51.001 --> 02:24:58.747]  An emergency alert comes on, they turn your power, they turn your electricity off, and then 90% go to the camp, and then they send in troops the other 10%.
[02:24:58.747 --> 02:25:03.211]  But look at the Russians, they can't beat the Ukrainians, or the Vietnamese can't beat us.
[02:25:03.211 --> 02:25:08.235]  And I'm sorry, my line of the sand is I'm not going to one of these things, and I've already told my family,
[02:25:09.505 --> 02:25:15.730]  That's why I haven't cut and run, but I mean, I need to be able to broadcast from a very remote location.
[02:25:15.730 --> 02:25:20.394]  You want to be on 30, 40 acres around people that all know what's going on in the middle of nowhere.
[02:25:20.394 --> 02:25:22.836]  That'll be the last places the troops come for.
[02:25:22.836 --> 02:25:25.359]  They're going to kill all the low-hanging fruit.
[02:25:25.359 --> 02:25:28.121]  And again, it's all compartmentalized, so the military is not going to even know what they're a part of.
[02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:29.802]  The military just takes you to the left.
[02:25:29.802 --> 02:25:31.444]  It's run death camp.
[02:25:31.444 --> 02:25:31.704]  All right.
[02:25:31.704 --> 02:25:33.085]  Thanks for waking us up, Alex.
[02:25:33.085 --> 02:25:34.686]  I appreciate you so much.
[02:25:34.686 --> 02:25:35.227]  God bless you.
[02:25:35.822 --> 02:25:37.644]  I appreciate you.
[02:25:37.644 --> 02:25:39.486]  We're showing FEMA documents on screen right now.
[02:25:39.486 --> 02:25:42.729]  I didn't know your call was going to bring that up.
[02:25:42.729 --> 02:25:45.212]  Nothing makes me madder than when my memory doesn't work.
[02:25:45.212 --> 02:25:47.394]  I probably covered this 50 times.
[02:25:47.394 --> 02:25:49.476]  It was like two years ago.
[02:25:49.476 --> 02:25:53.380]  There was a CDC, FDA, FEMA document.
[02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:56.147]  We're good to go.
[02:26:13.919 --> 02:26:14.259]  Hello, Alex.
[02:26:38.283 --> 02:26:44.625]  I wanted to talk about the invasion at the southern border and all these Chinese nationals coming in, military age men.
[02:26:44.625 --> 02:26:51.627]  Oh yeah, I saw footage last night, I forgot to send the crew, of over 500 Chinese, mainly men, just coming through.
[02:26:51.627 --> 02:27:07.152]  Well, I'm wondering, back in the day, Obama said he wanted a civilian police force, or something like that, and I'm wondering, I know they have the 87,000 IRS agents, you know, starting to come up, are they going to try to deputize
[02:27:07.825 --> 02:27:10.366]  And militarize these Chinese people.
[02:27:10.366 --> 02:27:21.252]  Yes, already in New York, and in Chicago, and in California, and Washington, and in Oregon, and a bunch of other states, they are deputizing illegal aliens for law enforcement.
[02:27:21.252 --> 02:27:22.273]  That's been going on two years.
[02:27:22.273 --> 02:27:24.634]  Yes, that is the plan.
[02:27:24.634 --> 02:27:25.514]  I mean, look at these guys.
[02:27:25.514 --> 02:27:26.595]  They're all military age men.
[02:27:26.595 --> 02:27:31.378]  And I can tell by the build of those guys, we all know what military guys look like.
[02:27:31.378 --> 02:27:32.338]  Those guys are military.
[02:27:34.932 --> 02:27:41.717]  Well, my concern is that once they do that, I don't believe our military, the U.S.
[02:27:41.717 --> 02:27:44.879]  military, will come and disarm a U.S.
[02:27:44.879 --> 02:27:45.579]  citizen.
[02:27:45.579 --> 02:27:49.021]  Will they use these Chinese dudes to come take our stuff?
[02:27:49.021 --> 02:27:50.702]  Yes, but they're not going to fight us head on.
[02:27:50.702 --> 02:27:54.445]  They're going to blow up power plants, cut food off, and say the patriots did it.
[02:27:54.445 --> 02:27:57.227]  So, that's why they're already softening us up, shutting off infrastructure.
[02:27:57.227 --> 02:28:00.229]  They're going to turn the power off, brother.
[02:28:00.229 --> 02:28:02.010]  And then people are going to say... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:28:03.131 --> 02:28:04.355]  It's like your EMP movie.
[02:28:04.355 --> 02:28:05.779]  They don't have to parachute in.
[02:28:05.779 --> 02:28:07.765]  They're already here.
[02:28:07.765 --> 02:28:08.227]  Absolutely.
[02:28:10.438 --> 02:28:13.000]  Listen, we could not be more extreme here.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.961]  I don't have words to describe how critical it is.
[02:28:14.961 --> 02:28:15.822]  This is the takeover.
[02:28:15.822 --> 02:28:19.525]  We're in the war and part of the government says China's attacking us.
[02:28:19.525 --> 02:28:20.805]  We've got to move our jobs back.
[02:28:20.805 --> 02:28:24.168]  I mean, a lot of the government's finally figuring out they got double-crossed.
[02:28:24.168 --> 02:28:27.150]  But the globalists like Bill Gates and others are in charge.
[02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:31.213]  They are killing the dollar, killing the border, killing the military, killing the infrastructure.
[02:28:31.213 --> 02:28:36.137]  They did the SRT training and the tranny training and the poison shots to drive the good people out of the military.
[02:28:38.095 --> 02:28:42.200]  Okay, well that's all I wanted to say and get your opinion on, so I appreciate it.
[02:28:57.864 --> 02:29:02.888]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:29:02.888 --> 02:29:05.050]  We made it even stronger.
[02:29:05.050 --> 02:29:08.793]  The strongest long-term energy you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:29:08.793 --> 02:29:15.678]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:29:15.678 --> 02:29:22.123]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:29:22.123 --> 02:29:23.184]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:29:23.864 --> 02:29:36.929]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:29:36.929 --> 02:29:38.910]  It is the super fuel.
[02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:40.390]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:29:40.390 --> 02:29:41.250]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:42.211]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:29:42.211 --> 02:29:43.391]  They go good with this.
[02:29:43.391 --> 02:29:45.412]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:29:46.149 --> 02:29:47.631]  This is the boss.
[02:29:47.631 --> 02:29:48.372]  TurboForce.
[02:29:48.372 --> 02:29:49.394]  Back in stock.
[02:29:49.394 --> 02:29:49.954]  Discounted.
[02:29:49.954 --> 02:29:52.118]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:52.118 --> 02:29:52.999]  More power.
[02:29:52.999 --> 02:29:53.980]  More strength.
[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:57.585]  More energy.
[02:29:57.585 --> 02:30:00.970]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.871 --> 02:30:07.212]  I want you all to know something.
[02:30:07.212 --> 02:30:09.173]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:09.173 --> 02:30:12.696]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:30:12.696 --> 02:30:15.658]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:30:15.658 --> 02:30:20.081]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:30:20.081 --> 02:30:22.283]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:22.283 --> 02:30:25.825]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:30:25.825 --> 02:30:29.268]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:30:29.548 --> 02:30:32.409]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:30:32.409 --> 02:30:33.430]  Years ago.
[02:30:33.430 --> 02:30:37.512]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:30:37.512 --> 02:30:40.033]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:30:40.033 --> 02:30:42.494]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:30:42.494 --> 02:30:45.616]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.616 --> 02:30:50.258]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:30:57.711 --> 02:31:03.419]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[02:31:03.419 --> 02:31:06.103]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:31:06.103 --> 02:31:08.727]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[02:31:08.727 --> 02:31:09.468]  Period.
[02:31:09.468 --> 02:31:10.570]  Case closed.
[02:31:10.570 --> 02:31:11.932]  Out to get you and your family.
[02:31:11.932 --> 02:31:12.473]  We shall
[02:31:12.913 --> 02:31:20.204]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:31:20.204 --> 02:31:27.775]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[02:31:28.576 --> 02:31:32.959]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:31:32.959 --> 02:31:34.480]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:37.282]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:31:37.282 --> 02:31:42.525]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[02:31:42.525 --> 02:31:47.989]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:31:47.989 --> 02:31:49.630]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:31:49.630 --> 02:31:51.211]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:31:51.211 --> 02:31:52.772]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:31:52.772 --> 02:31:55.174]  The point is, you can get the filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:31:55.174 --> 02:31:56.534]  They're discounted right now.
[02:31:56.534 --> 02:31:57.255]  Finally back in stock.
[02:31:57.515 --> 02:32:10.185]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border, exposing the cartels, and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[02:32:10.185 --> 02:32:11.946]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[02:32:11.946 --> 02:32:13.708]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[02:32:14.119 --> 02:32:16.921]  Now I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[02:32:16.921 --> 02:32:18.643]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:32:18.643 --> 02:32:21.145]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[02:32:21.145 --> 02:32:25.508]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:32:25.508 --> 02:32:31.213]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[02:32:31.213 --> 02:32:36.217]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[02:32:36.217 --> 02:32:39.360]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:44.024]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.648 --> 02:33:17.553]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:17.553 --> 02:33:19.214]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:32.305 --> 02:33:34.607]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours, too.
[02:33:34.607 --> 02:33:36.888]  You'll fire a musket, but I'll run you through.
[02:33:36.888 --> 02:33:43.752]  And when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand for falling back.
[02:33:43.752 --> 02:33:46.094]  Bring it on.
[02:33:46.094 --> 02:33:48.495]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours, too.
[02:33:48.495 --> 02:33:52.238]  You'll fire a musket, but I'll run you through.
[02:33:52.238 --> 02:33:56.120]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand
[02:34:24.933 --> 02:34:27.474]  No one wins serving the New World Order.
[02:34:27.474 --> 02:34:31.095]  You can pretend you're not a prisoner, but you just haven't been put in a cage yet.
[02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:37.597]  While you're getting rid of the one group, you're being prepared to be put in the death camp yourself.
[02:34:37.597 --> 02:34:40.618]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me mention this.
[02:34:40.618 --> 02:34:48.681]  Molly Kennery, non-binary SNL star, shares literal uplifting message with trans kids.
[02:34:48.681 --> 02:34:53.062]  I've been hung up on my genitals for far too long, and I'm starting to feel like I'm freaking.
[02:34:56.385 --> 02:35:12.193]  So, if they can sexualize your children, if they can sterilize them like it's the cool thing to do, children are very impregnable, very impressionable, very implantable with messages.
[02:35:12.193 --> 02:35:15.915]  And if you don't protect them, the system will swoop them in and do it.
[02:35:15.915 --> 02:35:16.676]  And they're doing it.
[02:35:17.659 --> 02:35:20.841]  And it's right in front of you happening now, and humanity's fighting back.
[02:35:20.841 --> 02:35:22.102]  The full clip's like five minutes long.
[02:35:22.102 --> 02:35:23.503]  I'm just going to play a little bit of this.
[02:35:23.503 --> 02:35:25.064]  This is truly sickening.
[02:35:25.064 --> 02:35:27.786]  SNL telling kids, cut your dick off.
[02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:36.009]  I've been hung up on my genitals for far too long, and I'm starting to feel like a frickin' Republican lawmaker!
[02:35:36.009 --> 02:35:38.169]  HELLO!
[02:35:38.169 --> 02:35:40.390]  So they're... Start it from the beginning.
[02:35:40.390 --> 02:35:46.792]  Oh, Republicans that don't want you to sexualize children and cut their testicles off, we're obsessed with genitals.
[02:35:46.792 --> 02:35:49.132]  No, you're obsessed with children's genitals.
[02:35:49.132 --> 02:35:55.694]  You're a big, fat, ugly man in a dress up there with a sick corporate system attacking America.
[02:35:55.694 --> 02:35:58.695]  And China's funding this, and this is illegal in China.
[02:35:58.695 --> 02:35:59.075]  Continue.
[02:35:59.975 --> 02:36:06.037]  I've been hung up on my genitals for far too long and I'm starting to feel like a frickin' Republican lawmaker.
[02:36:06.037 --> 02:36:07.978]  Hello!
[02:36:07.978 --> 02:36:09.279]  That's an awesome transition.
[02:36:09.279 --> 02:36:17.622]  So, as of this week, there are now over 14 states that have passed bills restricting health care for trans kids.
[02:36:17.622 --> 02:36:19.463]  Back in about five seconds.
[02:36:19.463 --> 02:36:21.103]  Health care.
[02:36:21.103 --> 02:36:23.104]  Hitler should have called his death camps health care.
[02:36:23.104 --> 02:36:24.084]  Well, it's health care.
[02:36:24.084 --> 02:36:27.506]  I mean, he lines them up and shoots them or, you know, puts them in death death chambers.
[02:36:29.662 --> 02:36:32.084]  It's just all how they spin this.
[02:36:32.084 --> 02:36:33.925]  Like, what is this?
[02:36:33.925 --> 02:36:35.646]  They just do it because it's their plan.
[02:36:35.646 --> 02:36:37.007]  Continue.
[02:36:37.007 --> 02:36:40.209]  They have passed bills restricting health care for trans kids.
[02:36:40.209 --> 02:36:40.789]  Listen to that, Michael.
[02:36:40.789 --> 02:36:41.109]  Pause again.
[02:36:41.109 --> 02:36:42.090]  Back it up.
[02:36:42.090 --> 02:36:48.254]  So, sterilizing a kid with dead, deadly chemicals that stop their growth, give them health problems the rest of their life before they can make that decision.
[02:36:48.254 --> 02:36:52.276]  Cutting their breasts off, cutting their uteruses off, cutting their testicles off, cutting their penises off.
[02:36:52.276 --> 02:36:54.398]  That's denying health care.
[02:36:55.586 --> 02:36:59.769]  I do not want anybody to be violent to the host of SNL, but imagine he's out on the street of New York.
[02:36:59.769 --> 02:37:05.734]  Somebody walks over and goes, here's your health care, and hits him right between the legs with a machete.
[02:37:05.734 --> 02:37:08.496]  Oh, he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I want my Johnson.
[02:37:08.496 --> 02:37:10.217]  But you want to go along with convincing kids.
[02:37:10.217 --> 02:37:13.620]  This is weaponized evil, folks.
[02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:14.981]  Continue.
[02:37:14.981 --> 02:37:18.864]  Fourteen states that have passed bills restricting health care for trans kids.
[02:37:19.301 --> 02:37:20.782]  Listen to that, Michael.
[02:37:20.782 --> 02:37:23.044]  Restricting healthcare for kids.
[02:37:23.044 --> 02:37:28.267]  For some reason, there's something about the word trans that makes people forget the word kids.
[02:37:28.267 --> 02:37:29.708]  Pause again.
[02:37:29.708 --> 02:37:31.409]  Look how empty this is.
[02:37:31.409 --> 02:37:32.450]  We want your children.
[02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:33.470]  We want to sexualize them.
[02:37:33.470 --> 02:37:38.674]  We want to put them in a database in the school, keep it secret from the parents, and put them on a fast track to be sterilized.
[02:37:38.674 --> 02:37:40.315]  Why are you upset?
[02:37:40.315 --> 02:37:42.296]  It's just healthcare.
[02:37:42.296 --> 02:37:44.138]  Like euthanasia is healthcare, right?
[02:37:44.138 --> 02:37:44.518]  Continue.
[02:37:45.543 --> 02:37:46.604]  Listen to that, Michael.
[02:37:46.604 --> 02:37:47.044]  Yeah.
[02:37:47.044 --> 02:37:49.306]  Restricting healthcare for kids.
[02:37:49.306 --> 02:37:54.930]  For some reason, there's something about the word trans that makes people forget the word kids.
[02:37:54.930 --> 02:38:00.353]  If you don't care about trans kids' lives, it means you don't care about frickin' kids' lives.
[02:38:00.353 --> 02:38:00.714]  Wow, nice.
[02:38:00.714 --> 02:38:07.779]  What's up with the puppet strings?
[02:38:07.779 --> 02:38:09.920]  And it goes on.
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.621]  It goes on.
[02:38:12.517 --> 02:38:14.698]  To have a message for the children.
[02:38:14.698 --> 02:38:16.278]  We're going to save you.
[02:38:16.278 --> 02:38:19.999]  We're the big corporate media.
[02:38:19.999 --> 02:38:20.320]  Wow.
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:23.361]  I mean, these people are the enemy.
[02:38:23.361 --> 02:38:27.082]  And we just have to stand against them.
[02:38:27.932 --> 02:38:30.095]  And realize what it is, and they're coming after our kids.
[02:38:30.095 --> 02:38:32.218]  They want our children sexually.
[02:38:32.218 --> 02:38:42.411]  That's all this is, is big corporate media saying, I want a relationship, not just to rape your child, not just to have sex with them, not just to ruin their innocence and their future, but to literally make sure they never reproduce.
[02:38:46.249 --> 02:38:55.677]  Oh, and they're standing up for the trans kids because some adults don't want the state and psychological experts coming in and brainwashing them with all their sick leptis parents that get off on this cult.
[02:38:55.677 --> 02:38:56.758]  I mean, this is it.
[02:38:56.758 --> 02:39:01.182]  They're legalizing human sacrifice, starting with their testicles.
[02:39:01.182 --> 02:39:02.903]  Woo!
[02:39:02.903 --> 02:39:04.224]  Craig in Dallas, you're on the air.
[02:39:04.224 --> 02:39:05.865]  Thanks for calling.
[02:39:05.865 --> 02:39:08.668]  Prophet Alex, it is a privilege to speak with you.
[02:39:08.668 --> 02:39:10.269]  We were born for this hour.
[02:39:10.269 --> 02:39:12.851]  Craig Treadwell here, full-time evangelist since 92.
[02:39:14.613 --> 02:39:20.255]  Yeah, Craig Treadwell, just type my name into YouTube, but here's the deal.
[02:39:20.255 --> 02:39:31.620]  I was a former co-host of Politics and Religion, and about 16 years ago, I was sitting in the radio studio in Dallas with Irvin Baxter, and I wanted to have you on.
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:37.782]  We had Aaron Russo on, Ron Paul on, Jerry Corsi on, and Joseph Bear on, some others.
[02:39:37.782 --> 02:39:41.943]  Well, a friend came in my studio, and he's like, hey, have you heard of Alex Jones?
[02:39:41.943 --> 02:39:42.664]  I'm like, no.
[02:39:43.948 --> 02:39:55.536]  I was looking up, researching, and I was about to call Rob Due, and I asked my boss, this was nothing against you, but I'm like, I never asked him.
[02:39:55.536 --> 02:39:57.237]  I always just had people on.
[02:39:57.237 --> 02:39:58.778]  He trusted me.
[02:39:58.778 --> 02:40:07.804]  And I have been beating myself up for 16 years because just to be kind about it, he didn't give me the green light to have you on.
[02:40:07.804 --> 02:40:08.745]  I'm like, what on earth?
[02:40:09.634 --> 02:40:10.175]  It would have been.
[02:40:10.175 --> 02:40:12.016]  Of course, you may not have wanted to come on with us.
[02:40:12.016 --> 02:40:13.737]  We were only on like 40 stations.
[02:40:13.737 --> 02:40:19.522]  But anyway, I give Last Days Prophecy seminars full time.
[02:40:19.522 --> 02:40:25.707]  And so I wanted to talk to you about, real quick, Revelation 9, 13 through 16 is Trumpet 6.
[02:40:29.552 --> 02:40:32.373]  And this is something I do in my seminars a lot.
[02:40:32.373 --> 02:40:36.575]  I'm 99% sure we're in the era of Trumpet 6.
[02:40:36.575 --> 02:40:38.495]  Can't say that 100% for sure.
[02:40:38.495 --> 02:40:41.236]  Well, I mean, no doubt they're trying to bring in the antichrist system.
[02:40:41.236 --> 02:40:46.078]  I mean, you can't deny they're trying to put, I mean, we don't know exactly when it comes to it, Al, but it's been fulfilled.
[02:40:46.078 --> 02:40:47.879]  It's happening now.
[02:40:47.879 --> 02:40:48.379]  Totally.
[02:40:48.379 --> 02:40:51.220]  And so two things in Trumpet 6.
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:53.341]  Number one, the global depopulation agenda.
[02:40:54.042 --> 02:40:57.925]  It says that it will wind up with killing one-third of mankind.
[02:40:57.925 --> 02:40:59.747]  That's about two and a half billion people.
[02:40:59.747 --> 02:41:00.187]  Exactly.
[02:41:00.187 --> 02:41:01.608]  That's how much before God intervenes.
[02:41:01.608 --> 02:41:03.510]  They kill one-third.
[02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:13.638]  Yes, Alex, and I believe that China is identified right there in verse 16, and here's what it says, that the number of the army of the horsemen was 200,000,000.
[02:41:13.638 --> 02:41:16.500]  Well, that's not a typo.
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:18.241]  In the Greek, it's a multiplication.
[02:41:18.241 --> 02:41:20.303]  Yeah, and there weren't that many people alive then.
[02:41:21.753 --> 02:41:22.314]  Right.
[02:41:22.314 --> 02:41:23.156]  So exactly.
[02:41:23.156 --> 02:41:27.745]  So 200,000 times 1,000 is a whopping 200 million.
[02:41:27.745 --> 02:41:33.196]  And it just so happens that Mao Zedong in the 40s bragged in his personal journal
[02:41:33.737 --> 02:41:37.581]  He said, I can put 200 million soldiers on the battlefield.
[02:41:37.581 --> 02:41:43.668]  Oh, they put 10 million in one week into Korea and kicked our ass in one week.
[02:41:43.668 --> 02:41:47.933]  And then MacArthur wanted to use nukes and Harry Truman said no and then relieved him of command.
[02:41:47.933 --> 02:41:48.814]  Exactly.
[02:41:48.814 --> 02:41:51.436]  There weren't 100 million people alive.
[02:41:52.617 --> 02:42:00.363]  2,000 years ago, when John the Revelator saw that, and he said, from the east they will come and invade into Israel 200 million men.
[02:42:00.363 --> 02:42:01.143]  I'm getting chills.
[02:42:01.143 --> 02:42:02.284]  And the whole thing's like that!
[02:42:02.284 --> 02:42:08.228]  He describes giant metal insects dropping eggs that create giant walls of fire as big as mountains.
[02:42:08.228 --> 02:42:12.891]  I mean, and marks to buy and sell, and everyone sees the image of the beast no matter where they are.
[02:42:12.891 --> 02:42:15.913]  And you've got to worship it, do what it says to get the mark.
[02:42:15.913 --> 02:42:17.894]  You don't just take the mark and get to buy stuff.
[02:42:17.894 --> 02:42:20.316]  You have to do what it says, the social credit score.
[02:42:20.316 --> 02:42:21.497]  It is incredible!
[02:42:22.546 --> 02:42:22.906]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:22.906 --> 02:42:25.869]  So I love the piece you did about China-Taiwan.
[02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:28.230]  Our Pentagon's had a policy since the 70s... Don't hang up!
[02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:29.231]  I'm gonna come back to you, Craig.
[02:42:29.231 --> 02:42:30.392]  Okay.
[02:42:30.392 --> 02:42:32.694]  And then Lisa, and David, and Joseph, and Tony.
[02:42:32.694 --> 02:42:36.937]  I'll get to every one of those callers before the next guest host takes over here today.
[02:42:36.937 --> 02:42:38.698]  And I forgot, I wasn't given a list today.
[02:42:38.698 --> 02:42:40.240]  Who's the guest host today?
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:41.781]  Carol Salente!
[02:42:41.781 --> 02:42:43.722]  Right?
[02:42:43.722 --> 02:42:45.784]  Okay, good.
[02:42:45.784 --> 02:42:50.988]  Our regular producer, who does a great job, and so does the other producer doing double duty, broke his leg this weekend, so he's not here.
[02:42:51.667 --> 02:42:53.957]  Alright, pray for Scott.
[02:42:53.957 --> 02:42:55.061]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:43:06.363 --> 02:43:15.147]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:43:15.147 --> 02:43:17.328]  So support InfoWars store.
[02:43:17.328 --> 02:43:25.812]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:43:25.812 --> 02:43:30.315]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:43:31.375 --> 02:43:39.158]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[02:43:39.158 --> 02:43:45.160]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:47.901]  Vitamin C and Zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[02:43:47.901 --> 02:43:50.082]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[02:43:50.082 --> 02:43:52.003]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[02:43:52.003 --> 02:43:55.344]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[02:43:55.344 --> 02:43:57.385]  You have to have these products.
[02:43:58.473 --> 02:44:02.435]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:44:02.435 --> 02:44:06.317]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:44:06.317 --> 02:44:08.698]  Here is a bulletin from PBS News.
[02:44:08.698 --> 02:44:10.359]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:44:11.089 --> 02:44:14.433]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:44:14.433 --> 02:44:18.898]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:44:18.898 --> 02:44:22.302]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:44:22.302 --> 02:44:26.346]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:44:26.346 --> 02:44:28.729]  It was almost as if it were a plan in bulk.
[02:44:28.729 --> 02:44:29.750]  It just happened.
[02:44:34.229 --> 02:44:36.351]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:44:36.351 --> 02:44:37.972]  They are nothing but distraction.
[02:44:37.972 --> 02:44:40.195]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:44:40.195 --> 02:44:42.657]  You silenced those voices.
[02:44:42.657 --> 02:44:46.421]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:44:46.421 --> 02:44:52.848]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globulars start going to prison!
[02:44:58.214 --> 02:45:00.917]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:45:00.917 --> 02:45:05.801]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[02:45:05.801 --> 02:45:11.126]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[02:45:11.126 --> 02:45:21.136]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to MFORWARESTORE.COM and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[02:45:21.696 --> 02:45:22.497]  We're good
[02:45:42.452 --> 02:45:44.894]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:45:44.894 --> 02:45:47.055]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:45:47.055 --> 02:45:49.236]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:16.763]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:46:16.763 --> 02:46:25.456]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:29.322]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:46:29.322 --> 02:46:35.888]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:46:35.888 --> 02:46:38.910]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:46:38.910 --> 02:46:45.976]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:46:45.976 --> 02:46:47.157]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:46:47.777 --> 02:46:52.161]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[02:46:52.161 --> 02:46:57.106]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:46:57.106 --> 02:46:59.047]  Please take action now.
[02:46:59.047 --> 02:47:04.933]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:14.821 --> 02:47:18.443]  I'm going to go back to Craig in Dallas.
[02:47:18.443 --> 02:47:21.605]  But I've got a very important announcement to make right now.
[02:47:21.605 --> 02:47:37.775]  I want every listener, and there are millions of you, to go to InfoWars.com right now, the live show feed, every day I write a new headline for the show, Bombshell Monday Broadcast, Elon Musk Exposes Illegal Government Spying, and Twitter, as Globals announce plan to deforest planet to stop climate change.
[02:47:37.775 --> 02:47:39.196]  We covered that in the first hour.
[02:47:39.196 --> 02:47:41.678]  But scroll down.
[02:47:41.678 --> 02:47:43.459]  Under that is the link
[02:47:45.012 --> 02:47:51.154]  Two, Beyond the Reset.
[02:47:51.154 --> 02:47:53.695]  It's a 26-minute film.
[02:47:53.695 --> 02:47:54.895]  That is my breakdown of it.
[02:47:54.895 --> 02:48:01.337]  You're saying it's about 45 minutes long, but we'll also post under there the actual video.
[02:48:01.337 --> 02:48:02.138]  Yeah, go ahead and scroll down.
[02:48:02.138 --> 02:48:02.578]  It's under that.
[02:48:04.431 --> 02:48:05.052]  There it is.
[02:48:05.052 --> 02:48:06.393]  26 minutes long.
[02:48:06.393 --> 02:48:08.215]  The fourth link down.
[02:48:08.215 --> 02:48:09.936]  In fact, it's so important.
[02:48:09.936 --> 02:48:15.422]  Tell Ben out there, move that on top of the live show feed.
[02:48:15.422 --> 02:48:19.166]  Move beyond the Great Reset animated short film, only 24 minutes long.
[02:48:19.166 --> 02:48:22.209]  Move it to the top of that page.
[02:48:22.209 --> 02:48:23.430]  And say, this is a
[02:48:25.109 --> 02:48:25.990]  Maximum alert.
[02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:29.132]  Your mission, if you choose to be accepted, get this out.
[02:48:29.132 --> 02:48:35.056]  Because this is where they actually took people in China, tried to take them in Italy and Australia.
[02:48:35.056 --> 02:48:36.057]  This is their real plan.
[02:48:36.057 --> 02:48:37.498]  This is not an animation.
[02:48:37.498 --> 02:48:39.399]  This is a documentary.
[02:48:39.399 --> 02:48:41.540]  And the thing had 900,000 views yesterday.
[02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:43.842]  Somebody else made it a month ago.
[02:48:43.842 --> 02:48:49.286]  And I did a major drive plugging it, and it got another 200,000 views.
[02:48:49.286 --> 02:48:49.766]  I don't like that.
[02:48:51.854 --> 02:48:54.076]  I want to see 5 million views tomorrow.
[02:48:54.076 --> 02:48:58.139]  And I'm not bitching at you, but I'm telling you, this exposes them.
[02:48:58.139 --> 02:48:59.740]  People need to see this.
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:00.761]  Okay?
[02:49:00.761 --> 02:49:01.682]  This is powerful.
[02:49:01.682 --> 02:49:02.582]  This is true.
[02:49:02.582 --> 02:49:03.263]  We're going to take it.
[02:49:03.263 --> 02:49:03.943]  We're doing it right now.
[02:49:03.943 --> 02:49:05.805]  I'm going to show it today and tomorrow.
[02:49:05.805 --> 02:49:13.091]  And I'm going to take it and put clips in documenting every piece of it, how it's real.
[02:49:13.091 --> 02:49:15.873]  So, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:49:15.873 --> 02:49:16.813]  Go to the live show feed.
[02:49:17.799 --> 02:49:20.341]  Get that link and share it, share it, share it.
[02:49:20.341 --> 02:49:27.688]  In fact, we already posted it Saturday by itself, but have Ben or whoever's out there repost it.
[02:49:27.688 --> 02:49:31.111]  Beyond the Great Reset must see film.
[02:49:31.111 --> 02:49:33.753]  Share this link to stop the new world order or something like that.
[02:49:33.753 --> 02:49:35.895]  Just get it out, folks, okay?
[02:49:35.895 --> 02:49:38.057]  I know victory when I see it.
[02:49:38.057 --> 02:49:38.898]  I know truth when I see it.
[02:49:38.898 --> 02:49:40.399]  This needs to be seen.
[02:49:40.399 --> 02:49:44.623]  And if it reaches 5 million people, that sucks.
[02:49:46.513 --> 02:49:51.156]  Because in 24 minutes, they do what I did in a two and a half hour film, Endgame.
[02:49:51.156 --> 02:49:53.838]  They still had Google Video then.
[02:49:53.838 --> 02:49:59.902]  And when they took Google Video down, when I looked at it, it had 98 million views.
[02:49:59.902 --> 02:50:02.063]  They had like 20 million on YouTube and they took that down.
[02:50:02.063 --> 02:50:03.864]  There's a few versions with millions of views up.
[02:50:03.864 --> 02:50:06.406]  There's one at Bandop Video with like 500,000 views.
[02:50:06.406 --> 02:50:11.269]  My point is, is that Endgame takes two and a half hours and you get the same message.
[02:50:11.269 --> 02:50:12.390]  This is in 26 minutes, 24 minutes.
[02:50:12.390 --> 02:50:12.950]  You need to get it.
[02:50:16.007 --> 02:50:17.108]  I'm not being paid to say this.
[02:50:17.108 --> 02:50:20.151]  You need to share on your email, your text message, everywhere.
[02:50:20.151 --> 02:50:21.833]  This is the future.
[02:50:21.833 --> 02:50:23.655]  This is how we beat them.
[02:50:23.655 --> 02:50:25.537]  It is so important.
[02:50:25.537 --> 02:50:28.580]  So, this is not an order.
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:29.481]  It's a plead.
[02:50:31.189 --> 02:50:34.950]  Go to InfoWars, get the link and share it, now.
[02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:46.535]  And please go to InfoWars and get some of our great products, the great t-shirts, the great books, the great films, the water filtration, aerial filtration, 70-76 exhaust from most, a turbo force pack in stock, because that's how we fund the operation, and I thank you.
[02:50:46.535 --> 02:50:50.156]  But this is about action, and what broadcast is delivering more.
[02:50:50.156 --> 02:50:59.460]  We take all the best research, all the best clips, all the best people, all the best guests, all the best calls, we put them in one place, and that's why the enemy hates us, because we're a clearinghouse of free thought.
[02:51:00.452 --> 02:51:09.980]  But I'm going to tell you, if I don't see 2 million views, 3 million views tomorrow, it's a major disappointment.
[02:51:09.980 --> 02:51:13.423]  It needs 100 million views.
[02:51:13.423 --> 02:51:16.986]  And back before the enemy thought we were strong, or just ignored us, we were under the radar.
[02:51:16.986 --> 02:51:19.788]  Man, 98 million views on Google Video for Endgame?
[02:51:19.788 --> 02:51:28.255]  I had other films got 50, 60 million views on there?
[02:51:28.255 --> 02:51:29.356]  And it makes me mad that
[02:51:30.717 --> 02:51:35.922]  If a couple billion people saw this, the globals couldn't carry this out, because this is a real plan.
[02:51:35.922 --> 02:51:37.803]  This is like somebody got a time machine, folks.
[02:51:37.803 --> 02:51:39.565]  They're getting the next bioweapon ready.
[02:51:39.565 --> 02:51:40.245]  This is real.
[02:51:40.245 --> 02:51:43.288]  This is happening.
[02:51:43.288 --> 02:51:45.570]  This isn't all the entertainment, all the crap out there.
[02:51:45.570 --> 02:51:48.172]  This is real, okay?
[02:51:48.172 --> 02:51:55.419]  So when I see a weapon of truth that I know is effective, and I tell you that I think you should bust your ass sharing it, I mean that.
[02:51:56.869 --> 02:51:58.810]  And you notice, I don't do this most of the time about our stuff.
[02:51:58.810 --> 02:52:00.251]  Our information is great.
[02:52:00.251 --> 02:52:02.011]  But most of the time, I'm like, this is gold!
[02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:05.013]  This person, this, this, this right here.
[02:52:05.013 --> 02:52:05.913]  And I mean, it's victory.
[02:52:05.913 --> 02:52:09.215]  I mean, if three or four billion people see this, we win.
[02:52:09.215 --> 02:52:10.896]  I mean, you know, I mean, it's that simple.
[02:52:10.896 --> 02:52:12.437]  They'll never get this through.
[02:52:12.437 --> 02:52:13.597]  They're planning new lockdowns.
[02:52:13.597 --> 02:52:13.917]  You know that?
[02:52:13.917 --> 02:52:15.578]  They're planning to do this to us.
[02:52:15.578 --> 02:52:17.119]  This is what they're going to do to us.
[02:52:17.119 --> 02:52:20.020]  We're not in the prison camp yet.
[02:52:20.020 --> 02:52:21.301]  Please, for God's sakes.
[02:52:26.090 --> 02:52:28.793]  All right, Craig, finish up about Revelation.
[02:52:28.793 --> 02:52:29.934]  Hey, thank you, Prophet Alex.
[02:52:29.934 --> 02:52:33.377]  Hey, Craig Treadwell here again, watching the last day's Prophecy Seminars.
[02:52:33.377 --> 02:52:44.547]  Hey, bro, I'm telling you, you know, like, what are the chances that Mao Tse Tung spoke of the exact number prophesied in Revelation 9-16, and then you mentioned the Mark of the Beast,
[02:52:45.430 --> 02:52:48.814]  And, you know, that's Revelation 13, 18, Hallmark verse.
[02:52:48.814 --> 02:52:51.536]  So real quick, where it says – we all say 666.
[02:52:51.536 --> 02:52:57.202]  In the Greek, it's kisi stigma, C-H-I-X-I, the word stigma.
[02:52:57.202 --> 02:53:05.531]  That last word stigma means to stick or to prick a mark injected or incised, punched for recognition of ownership.
[02:53:06.371 --> 02:53:10.272]  And it's like, whoa, something placed a global identification.
[02:53:10.272 --> 02:53:17.634]  No, I was told when I first got on air like 29 years ago, I was I was going to speak at these Christian revivals that were having in North Austin.
[02:53:17.634 --> 02:53:19.394]  I remember the preacher at dinner.
[02:53:19.394 --> 02:53:21.895]  I said, the mark of the beast will be a barcode to buy.
[02:53:21.895 --> 02:53:27.276]  So he said, no, it will be a genetic injection that takes over your body.
[02:53:27.276 --> 02:53:28.256]  That will be the mark of the beast.
[02:53:28.256 --> 02:53:28.877]  And I said, how do you know?
[02:53:28.877 --> 02:53:29.917]  He said, I had a vision.
[02:53:29.917 --> 02:53:30.377]  And now we're here.
[02:53:31.638 --> 02:53:32.419]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:32.419 --> 02:53:36.782]  And it's like what DARPA is doing with the injectable, you know, COVID chips.
[02:53:36.782 --> 02:53:43.907]  And so, you know, in this day of cotton candy Christianity, and I have to give you credit, and I tell you, people come up to me in Q&A.
[02:53:43.907 --> 02:53:46.610]  I was just in Athens, Texas last few days.
[02:53:46.610 --> 02:53:51.473]  I just spoke at 15 churches in California, and people come up to me, and like, where do you get your information?
[02:53:51.473 --> 02:53:55.957]  I'm like, well, I've got dozens of sources, but I do mention you, and I mention InfoWars,
[02:53:56.417 --> 02:54:00.618]  Because you are on the cutting edge like no one else is.
[02:54:00.618 --> 02:54:01.579]  I think we're cousins.
[02:54:01.579 --> 02:54:03.139]  But here's the thing.
[02:54:03.139 --> 02:54:05.940]  It's like we're living this.
[02:54:05.940 --> 02:54:13.982]  And so I'm trying to wake people up so I'm not one of these cotton candy, you know, idiots that are afraid to speak truth.
[02:54:13.982 --> 02:54:15.142]  And not that I'm anything.
[02:54:15.142 --> 02:54:17.183]  I'm just one dolphin in God's vast ocean.
[02:54:17.183 --> 02:54:20.224]  But I'm gonna give you some credit, Alex, and I know you're humble, but
[02:54:20.985 --> 02:54:24.808]  Uh, you deserve it, um, because you're, you're, you're like fearless.
[02:54:24.808 --> 02:54:25.989]  You are fearless, man.
[02:54:25.989 --> 02:54:27.891]  Well, brother, we're all on the same mission.
[02:54:27.891 --> 02:54:28.971]  We're all under attack.
[02:54:28.971 --> 02:54:39.019]  Once you realize you have nothing to lose but to fight, you should be expecting me to do this, but finishing up the revelation, is it not incredible how much, it's literally all being fulfilled word for word.
[02:54:39.019 --> 02:54:40.921]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:54:40.921 --> 02:54:47.146]  We're living it in living color and all this is... But it's word for word, exactly as it was said.
[02:54:48.098 --> 02:54:48.598]  Exactly.
[02:54:48.598 --> 02:54:53.502]  Because God gave us free will, but God loves us and gave us the answers and the tests.
[02:54:53.502 --> 02:54:56.865]  You got free will, son, but here it is.
[02:54:56.865 --> 02:54:57.886]  Free will.
[02:54:57.886 --> 02:54:58.906]  Don't give it up.
[02:54:58.906 --> 02:55:00.708]  Don't surrender your free will.
[02:55:00.708 --> 02:55:02.969]  You've got to stand and you've got to fight.
[02:55:02.969 --> 02:55:04.711]  You've got to fight with everything you've got.
[02:55:04.711 --> 02:55:06.772]  Because if you don't, they're going to kill you.
[02:55:06.772 --> 02:55:07.553]  And that's the goal.
[02:55:07.553 --> 02:55:08.414]  That's the agenda.
[02:55:08.414 --> 02:55:12.276]  And they want to get you in a prison cell to make you sign over to Satan so they can eat your soul.
[02:55:12.276 --> 02:55:12.777]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:12.777 --> 02:55:13.297]  God bless you.
[02:55:13.297 --> 02:55:14.258]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:14.258 --> 02:55:15.299]  Lisa in Florida.
[02:55:15.299 --> 02:55:15.979]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:15.979 --> 02:55:16.440]  We love you.
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:16.660]  Go ahead.
[02:55:18.658 --> 02:55:21.480]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:25.263]  Today I just felt particularly inspired to plug.
[02:55:25.263 --> 02:55:35.871]  I've called before and I never got to, but I need to do that today because I recently, in the past three months, have lost about 15 or 16 pounds on Diet Force.
[02:55:35.871 --> 02:55:47.099]  I started taking it three months ago and, you know, it's doing great, but, you know, a lot of people are talking about investing and saving your money.
[02:55:48.755 --> 02:55:56.399]  You know, gold and silver and all that, but don't forget to invest in your health because that's more important than anything.
[02:55:56.399 --> 02:56:00.100]  If you lose your health, you really don't have anything.
[02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:04.763]  So I always view this as, can you hear me?
[02:56:04.763 --> 02:56:05.283]  I am listening.
[02:56:05.283 --> 02:56:06.423]  Yes.
[02:56:06.423 --> 02:56:07.364]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:56:07.364 --> 02:56:07.964]  Yeah.
[02:56:07.964 --> 02:56:17.829]  Um, yeah, I, I started taking all these supplements about three years ago, but I started taking diet force about three months ago and it's all really been so helpful.
[02:56:18.622 --> 02:56:27.975]  And my husband always tells people, tells his patients, your health is your wealth and if you don't invest in your health, you will have nothing.
[02:56:27.975 --> 02:56:33.502]  So we really need to invest in our health.
[02:56:33.502 --> 02:56:35.986]  That's just something that
[02:56:36.596 --> 02:56:39.337]  With what's to come is vital.
[02:56:39.337 --> 02:56:40.217]  No, I totally agree.
[02:56:40.217 --> 02:56:48.540]  Look, diet force is a copy, because they let us do it, of a very well-known formula that doesn't use any bad stuff to get your body to speed.
[02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:49.981]  It's metabolism.
[02:56:49.981 --> 02:56:52.562]  So I'm glad you like diet force.
[02:56:52.562 --> 02:56:59.944]  Yeah, but you know, DNA force, vitamin C, you know, and also the prebiotic fiber.
[02:56:59.944 --> 02:57:04.666]  It just helps your stomach, your gut, and it's all just
[02:57:06.022 --> 02:57:18.294]  Vastly improved my health and my overall well-being and I think that I just I can't imagine people listening and not doing this and not trying it.
[02:57:18.294 --> 02:57:19.775]  It's just so important.
[02:57:19.775 --> 02:57:22.879]  Well you and your husband are awesome for your support of the broadcast.
[02:57:22.879 --> 02:57:25.541]  What do you think of all the craziness going on?
[02:57:25.541 --> 02:57:30.246]  Well you know I post the video that you were just mentioning.
[02:57:31.824 --> 02:57:33.386]  Hold on, don't hang up.
[02:57:33.386 --> 02:57:33.907]  Don't hang up.
[02:57:33.907 --> 02:57:35.649]  I'll come right back to you in two minutes.
[02:57:35.649 --> 02:57:42.158]  And then Tony, Joseph, and David, I'll take a little bit of Gerald Celente's time, and I will hand the baton to the great trends forecaster Gerald Celente.
[02:57:42.158 --> 02:57:44.121]  Hour number four, straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[02:57:48.427 --> 02:57:53.430]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[02:57:53.430 --> 02:57:55.611]  We made it even stronger.
[02:57:55.611 --> 02:57:59.353]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:57:59.353 --> 02:58:06.238]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:06.238 --> 02:58:12.321]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:58:12.321 --> 02:58:13.762]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:58:14.404 --> 02:58:27.472]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:58:27.472 --> 02:58:29.474]  It is the super fuel.
[02:58:29.474 --> 02:58:30.955]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:58:30.955 --> 02:58:31.795]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:58:31.795 --> 02:58:32.776]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:58:32.776 --> 02:58:33.957]  They go good with this.
[02:58:33.957 --> 02:58:35.978]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:58:36.696 --> 02:58:38.177]  This is the Boss.
[02:58:38.177 --> 02:58:38.917]  TurboForce.
[02:58:38.917 --> 02:58:39.938]  Back in stock.
[02:58:39.938 --> 02:58:40.498]  Discounted.
[02:58:40.498 --> 02:58:42.679]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:42.679 --> 02:58:43.560]  More power.
[02:58:43.560 --> 02:58:44.541]  More strength.
[02:58:44.541 --> 02:58:45.061]  More energy.
[02:58:48.656 --> 02:58:52.558]  1776 Testosterone Boost is back in stock.
[02:58:52.558 --> 02:58:58.742]  It is a private label of the number one best-selling natural testosterone booster on the market.
[02:58:58.742 --> 02:59:02.564]  It does incredible things for men, but women also love it.
[02:59:02.564 --> 02:59:06.586]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to experience this product for yourself.
[02:59:06.586 --> 02:59:09.848]  I never have any issues in the libido department.
[02:59:10.288 --> 02:59:15.154]  But it's always good to supercharge it and take it to the next level.
[02:59:15.154 --> 02:59:19.879]  And I'm just going to tell you, bottom line, my wife is blown away.
[02:59:19.879 --> 02:59:27.308]  I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the sheets and I'm telling you, at 49, I've got more energy
[02:59:27.608 --> 02:59:28.068]  We're good to go.
[03:00:00.635 --> 03:00:03.457]  Alright, let's go back to Lisa here on the Alex Jones Show from Florida.
[03:00:03.457 --> 03:00:08.960]  Do you want to talk about the dystopian Beyond the Reset documentary that's posted at InfoWars.com?
[03:00:08.960 --> 03:00:10.580]  Go ahead.
[03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:16.724]  Hi, yeah, I'm not sure if people really... I mean, I feel like people... I've discussed it with people.
[03:00:16.724 --> 03:00:19.225]  In fact, I discussed it with a guy the other day.
[03:00:19.225 --> 03:00:22.727]  He noticed my hat that I was wearing, my InfoWars hat.
[03:00:22.727 --> 03:00:27.670]  And we were talking about just general InfoWars, because he's a fan also.
[03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:31.582]  But I just, I don't know how real it is to people.
[03:00:31.582 --> 03:00:37.765]  I don't think that, I can't really get people to understand how real it is.
[03:00:37.765 --> 03:00:41.766]  They just, they hear it, but they don't really hear it.
[03:00:41.766 --> 03:00:44.128]  If that makes sense.
[03:00:44.128 --> 03:00:45.568]  They did this in China.
[03:00:45.568 --> 03:00:46.509]  They're trying this here.
[03:00:46.509 --> 03:00:47.709]  This is their plan.
[03:00:47.709 --> 03:00:48.610]  This is their admitted plan.
[03:00:48.610 --> 03:00:50.951]  This is like, you watch this, this is what they're going to do.
[03:00:52.606 --> 03:00:57.669]  I mean, these are smart people, and they want to be aware, but they just don't.
[03:00:57.669 --> 03:01:02.051]  My husband, I mean, I don't even think he really thinks that stuff is gonna happen.
[03:01:02.051 --> 03:01:07.795]  He thinks it's just a lot of talk, or, you know, that it really can't happen.
[03:01:07.795 --> 03:01:12.617]  It's like that, what do you call it, the normalcy bias?
[03:01:12.617 --> 03:01:13.978]  Yes.
[03:01:13.978 --> 03:01:15.359]  Sort of a normalcy bias.
[03:01:15.359 --> 03:01:17.180]  I think people are stuck in a normalcy bias.
[03:01:17.180 --> 03:01:19.101]  And because they can't admit it, they go along with it.
[03:01:20.066 --> 03:01:24.228]  Right, and they go along with it, and some people even are sarcastic about it.
[03:01:24.228 --> 03:01:33.052]  I've had a couple of people actually make fun of me a little bit because I say stuff like that, and they think it's so outlandish and so ridiculous.
[03:01:33.052 --> 03:01:33.933]  And I don't care.
[03:01:33.933 --> 03:01:35.813]  They can say what they want.
[03:01:35.813 --> 03:01:37.434]  I still tell people.
[03:01:39.511 --> 03:01:43.834]  But it takes a lot of perseverance for people, I think, that you're a listener.
[03:01:43.834 --> 03:01:44.955]  No, it does.
[03:01:44.955 --> 03:01:49.558]  Perseverance because the alternative is a thousand times worse than persevering through this.
[03:01:49.558 --> 03:01:50.699]  So just keep it up.
[03:01:50.699 --> 03:02:02.587]  You know, it makes me think of the story that I think you told it once about people, like if you get held up in a parking lot and somebody sticks a gun to your rib and say, get in the car.
[03:02:02.587 --> 03:02:08.050]  And if they get you in that car and slap a cuff on you or get the door locked,
[03:02:09.153 --> 03:02:11.955]  And they take you out into the middle of nowhere.
[03:02:11.955 --> 03:02:13.376]  That's where we're headed.
[03:02:13.376 --> 03:02:20.100]  Exactly, and it's not like you've got a perfect chance fighting them in the parking lot, but it's better than getting in a car, exactly.
[03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:20.460]  Right.
[03:02:20.460 --> 03:02:26.824]  Once they get you, like, cuffed in the car, then you're helpless, and then you're headed out into the middle of nowhere.
[03:02:26.824 --> 03:02:28.905]  It's just like that, you know?
[03:02:28.905 --> 03:02:30.386]  I mean, they just can't...
[03:02:30.834 --> 03:02:34.257]  They think they're going to be safe and they're not.
[03:02:34.257 --> 03:02:34.998]  You're right.
[03:02:34.998 --> 03:02:35.979]  Beautiful call.
[03:02:35.979 --> 03:02:36.940]  Thank you, Lisa.
[03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:37.961]  Love you.
[03:02:37.961 --> 03:02:38.801]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:38.801 --> 03:02:42.284]  Tony in Colorado, go ahead.
[03:02:42.284 --> 03:02:44.106]  Hi, this is Tony from Colorado.
[03:02:44.106 --> 03:02:50.552]  I just have a comment as far as face phones and getting people to actually prepare.
[03:02:52.765 --> 03:02:54.967]  You know, everybody really should be paying attention.
[03:02:54.967 --> 03:03:00.651]  We're actually kind of blessed with the opportunity to try to prepare as much as we can.
[03:03:00.651 --> 03:03:08.436]  We still do have some time left, but, you know, anybody living in cities and not in a rural area, we really should be looking into, you know, space zones.
[03:03:08.436 --> 03:03:15.621]  You know, maybe moving into certain parts of western Texas or, you know, certain parts of Nevada, Arizona.
[03:03:15.621 --> 03:03:20.225]  You know, kind of all these areas are a little bit more remote because, you know,
[03:03:22.216 --> 03:03:23.537]  You know, it's coming, right?
[03:03:23.537 --> 03:03:29.821]  I mean, the problems that we have, you know, Alex has been talking about this for, you know, 20-something years, right?
[03:03:29.821 --> 03:03:32.842]  And, you know, we're going to lose reserve currency status, right?
[03:03:32.842 --> 03:03:35.624]  You know, imagine what's that's going to happen overnight, right?
[03:03:35.624 --> 03:03:39.506]  I mean, our food supply is basically under attack, right?
[03:03:39.506 --> 03:03:41.948]  We have basically rogue AI.
[03:03:41.948 --> 03:03:45.750]  The war is happening right now, and we've got to get ready.
[03:03:47.003 --> 03:03:52.525]  That's absolutely correct.
[03:03:52.525 --> 03:03:55.506]  I told listeners 100% in the fight to stop it.
[03:03:55.506 --> 03:03:57.266]  We did not stop it.
[03:03:57.266 --> 03:03:58.546]  People are somewhat awake.
[03:03:58.546 --> 03:03:59.527]  We did not stop it.
[03:03:59.527 --> 03:04:03.428]  So I've told listeners, you have to spend a lot of your time now getting prepared individually.
[03:04:03.428 --> 03:04:06.669]  We have now hit the zone where we're not going to stop this now.
[03:04:07.549 --> 03:04:08.510]  Yeah, I 100% agree Alex.
[03:04:08.510 --> 03:04:08.830]  We have time.
[03:04:08.830 --> 03:04:09.650]  There's still time left.
[03:04:25.501 --> 03:04:28.963]  And my comment, I know you have a guest coming on, but my comment is... Hold on, stay there.
[03:04:28.963 --> 03:04:29.604]  He's cool.
[03:04:29.604 --> 03:04:30.825]  Gerald knows.
[03:04:30.825 --> 03:04:31.705]  He hosts The Fourth Hour.
[03:04:31.705 --> 03:04:32.666]  Sometimes I take a few minutes.
[03:04:32.666 --> 03:04:35.328]  So, come back, finish your point, Tony, then Joseph and David.
[03:04:35.328 --> 03:04:38.610]  I am the baton of the great Gerald Celente, top trends forecaster.
[03:04:38.610 --> 03:04:41.873]  Love listening to him every Monday, but he understands sometimes I take a little bit of time.
[03:04:41.873 --> 03:04:44.955]  We're going to come back and let you finish up.
[03:04:44.955 --> 03:04:46.476]  And we'll give Gerald his time back.
[03:04:46.476 --> 03:04:47.797]  We'll skip break number two.
[03:04:48.746 --> 03:04:51.388]  We'll skip the break at 16 after, okay?
[03:04:51.388 --> 03:04:58.632]  Alright, we'll be right back with your phone calls and Gerald Cilenta, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:58.632 --> 03:05:06.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:05:06.837 --> 03:05:08.298]  That is the hellish future.
[03:05:08.298 --> 03:05:16.823]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWars.com.
[03:05:17.683 --> 03:05:23.288]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:05:23.288 --> 03:05:25.870]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:05:25.870 --> 03:05:31.255]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[03:05:31.255 --> 03:05:35.199]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:35.199 --> 03:05:41.084]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:05:41.084 --> 03:05:43.165]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[03:05:43.946 --> 03:05:45.007]  Or unsigned copies.
[03:05:45.007 --> 03:05:55.354]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarshow.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:05:55.354 --> 03:05:56.395]  This is an InfoWar.
[03:05:56.395 --> 03:05:58.016]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:06:03.266 --> 03:06:05.308]  I wouldn't call it safe places.
[03:06:05.308 --> 03:06:06.008]  There's nowhere safe.
[03:06:06.008 --> 03:06:08.410]  But we need to talk about the safest places in America.
[03:06:08.410 --> 03:06:11.272]  And I've talked a lot with experts on this over the years.
[03:06:11.272 --> 03:06:13.994]  I've made films, I've promoted books.
[03:06:13.994 --> 03:06:15.635]  I think of Jill Scouser, one of the top guys.
[03:06:15.635 --> 03:06:16.455]  She's having back soon.
[03:06:16.455 --> 03:06:20.338]  But really we are at the point now where we keep trying to change things and do that.
[03:06:20.338 --> 03:06:22.019]  But the public's got to make its choice.
[03:06:22.019 --> 03:06:22.840]  The battle's happening.
[03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:25.221]  But we also have to protect ourselves and our children.
[03:06:25.221 --> 03:06:26.903]  So Tony, you got cut off by a break.
[03:06:26.903 --> 03:06:29.985]  What was your point about safe places or safer places around this country?
[03:06:30.714 --> 03:06:32.755]  Well, actually, yeah.
[03:06:32.755 --> 03:06:33.336]  You're right, Alex.
[03:06:33.336 --> 03:06:35.397]  There's not necessarily any safer places.
[03:06:35.397 --> 03:06:41.401]  You know, I know you've had past guests on, you know, teaching people maybe where to go.
[03:06:41.401 --> 03:06:46.725]  But I guess my final comment is that I think we're in a different season, Alex.
[03:06:46.725 --> 03:06:50.087]  You know, you've been the canary in the coal mine, right?
[03:06:50.087 --> 03:06:53.309]  You know, saying that this is actually going to happen, right?
[03:06:53.309 --> 03:06:54.850]  And now it's finally happening.
[03:06:54.850 --> 03:06:59.854]  I'd like to maybe have an article maybe every once a month or
[03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:06.041]  Or maybe one show, maybe once a month on actually teaching people basically how to prepare.
[03:07:06.041 --> 03:07:10.282]  And what I mean by that is a lot of people, they hear your message, right?
[03:07:10.282 --> 03:07:14.343]  And they want to buy your products and they understand that stuff's coming.
[03:07:14.343 --> 03:07:18.583]  But some people, they didn't have a dad teach them to go hunting.
[03:07:18.583 --> 03:07:25.565]  They didn't have someone to teach them actually how to survive or how to build a garden or how to be kind of self-reliant, right?
[03:07:25.565 --> 03:07:26.185]  And I think
[03:07:27.611 --> 03:07:33.192]  You've done such a wonderful job over the years preparing us, but the second part of that is really...
[03:07:34.491 --> 03:07:37.193]  People really don't know how to do that, right?
[03:07:37.193 --> 03:07:40.255]  I mean, they can buy your products and they can buy survival stuff.
[03:07:40.255 --> 03:07:41.356]  No, no, I agree.
[03:07:41.356 --> 03:07:45.680]  And I'm going to ask Gerald Salente when he comes on in a few minutes to give us his take on how you get prepared.
[03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:48.482]  He moved out of New York, he moved to a rural area, built things up.
[03:07:48.482 --> 03:07:54.366]  I think we create communities of folks that are aware, that have different skills, because none of us can do everything, but then together we can survive.
[03:07:54.366 --> 03:07:56.188]  I think that's really going to be the future.
[03:07:56.188 --> 03:07:57.208]  Thanks for the call.
[03:07:57.208 --> 03:07:59.110]  Two more calls until Gerald Salente takes over.
[03:07:59.110 --> 03:08:00.631]  Joseph in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:08:03.038 --> 03:08:04.099]  You're amazing, Alex.
[03:08:04.099 --> 03:08:05.479]  You're amazing.
[03:08:05.479 --> 03:08:07.600]  Thank you, God, for Alex Jones.
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:10.482]  Make him more intimate with the Spirit, Father.
[03:08:10.482 --> 03:08:11.562]  Thank you for his life.
[03:08:11.562 --> 03:08:14.924]  Help him to see Jesus with him to his right hand like King David did.
[03:08:14.924 --> 03:08:17.825]  Report about Acts 2.25, Father.
[03:08:17.825 --> 03:08:25.649]  And pacify your war, Father, against Satan and Ezekiel and Eliminati through Alex's body, soul, and spirit.
[03:08:25.649 --> 03:08:26.149]  Well, thank you, brother.
[03:08:26.149 --> 03:08:28.530]  Fill him with your Spirit over and over again, God.
[03:08:28.530 --> 03:08:29.851]  Thank you for his life.
[03:08:29.851 --> 03:08:31.472]  Now, I got three points.
[03:08:31.472 --> 03:08:31.712]  First,
[03:08:32.819 --> 03:08:36.000]  The Lord's going to be giving you more bitcoins very soon.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:45.903]  Second, in the future, at some point, the Lord's going to be prompting you at different points in time to make a run for governor in Texas.
[03:08:45.903 --> 03:08:54.046]  And the third and final point is, at some point in the future, Joe Rogan will give his life to Jesus thanks to you.
[03:08:54.046 --> 03:08:58.687]  Jesus revealed that to me today about you, Alex, and the future.
[03:08:58.687 --> 03:08:59.407]  Amazing call.
[03:08:59.407 --> 03:09:00.407]  Thanks for the call, Joseph.
[03:09:00.407 --> 03:09:01.548]  David in California.
[03:09:01.548 --> 03:09:01.828]  Go ahead.
[03:09:03.348 --> 03:09:04.168]  Hey Alex, thank you.
[03:09:04.168 --> 03:09:06.529]  First time call, a long time listener.
[03:09:06.529 --> 03:09:32.397]  I'm on my way, Alex, to the barbershop to get my hair cut because I'm just pulling my hair out, Alex, because you keep... You're not being deceptive, but I think you're being disingenuous to your listeners because you're saying Trump is a change fan, Alex, and I don't... The reason why I say that is because you missed... You played two weeks ago after Trump's CPAC speech, you played the interview that Trump said three times that he will not drain the swamp
[03:09:32.981 --> 03:09:34.302]  Or go after his rivals.
[03:09:34.302 --> 03:09:38.466]  So I think you need to play that more, so people will have the full perspective.
[03:09:38.466 --> 03:09:39.086]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:09:39.086 --> 03:09:41.408]  But the Santas, they've already told to drop out.
[03:09:41.408 --> 03:09:42.429]  Trump's the nominee.
[03:09:42.429 --> 03:09:44.891]  Do we support Biden?
[03:09:44.891 --> 03:09:45.531]  No.
[03:09:45.531 --> 03:09:49.775]  Listen, bottom line, Alex, the scripture says, all authorities are ordained of God.
[03:09:49.775 --> 03:09:52.257]  So God's going to have his way regardless.
[03:09:52.257 --> 03:10:00.163]  And I want to encourage you, because where you're at in the scriptures, it's a scripture that says, I would not have you ignorant of Satan's devices.
[03:10:00.163 --> 03:10:01.925]  And also, it's another scripture that says,
[03:10:02.572 --> 03:10:09.197]  I give the people the knowledge, but my people reject the knowledge that I'm sending them, because I'm sending them the knowledge.
[03:10:09.197 --> 03:10:10.378]  So that's where you're at.
[03:10:10.378 --> 03:10:12.280]  You're giving God's people the knowledge.
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:22.088]  Now, Alex, all they have to do is apply themselves to the knowledge, but they're not somehow getting it, because we're in the end times, like the Evangelist said, of massive deception.
[03:10:22.088 --> 03:10:24.089]  As a matter of fact, I want to encourage you, Alex.
[03:10:24.089 --> 03:10:26.271]  I really want to encourage you, encourage you, encourage you.
[03:10:26.804 --> 03:10:29.186]  Read Matthew 28, 24th chapter.
[03:10:29.186 --> 03:10:31.327]  That's not me, that's Jesus saying.
[03:10:31.327 --> 03:10:32.588]  He said, matter of fact, here it is.
[03:10:32.588 --> 03:10:43.175]  It says, As he sat upon Mount Olive, and his disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be, Jesus, and the sign of your coming, and the end of the world?
[03:10:43.175 --> 03:10:44.456]  Verse 4, write this down.
[03:10:44.456 --> 03:10:48.158]  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
[03:10:48.158 --> 03:10:50.340]  For many shall come to my name, saying, I am Christ,
[03:10:50.825 --> 03:10:55.749]  And you shall hear wars and rumors of wars.
[03:10:55.749 --> 03:11:01.673]  Be not you be troubled, not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[03:11:01.673 --> 03:11:03.895]  Here we go, Russia and Ukraine again, or China.
[03:11:03.895 --> 03:11:08.338]  For nations shall rise against nations, kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines.
[03:11:08.338 --> 03:11:10.380]  Hey, you talked about the food shortage, right?
[03:11:10.380 --> 03:11:10.900]  Pestilence.
[03:11:10.900 --> 03:11:15.444]  Hey, you talked about the various diseases, and earthquakes in diverse places.
[03:11:15.444 --> 03:11:18.766]  All these things are the beginning of sorrows.
[03:11:18.766 --> 03:11:19.567]  And here's the woke
[03:11:19.915 --> 03:11:21.516]  Here's the woke era that we're living in.
[03:11:21.516 --> 03:11:28.259]  Verse 10, "...and many shall be easily offended, and betray one another, and hate one another.
[03:11:28.259 --> 03:11:31.080]  And many false prophets shall arise, and deceive many.
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:35.502]  And because the sin is abounding, the love of many shall wax cold.
[03:11:35.502 --> 03:11:40.604]  But," like he keeps telling us, "...he that endures till the end shall be saved."
[03:11:40.604 --> 03:11:45.766]  Now Alex, I'm going to encourage you with this one because you keep saying why they keep going after the kids, why they keep going after the kids.
[03:11:45.766 --> 03:11:46.467]  Well guess what?
[03:11:46.467 --> 03:11:48.027]  Listen to what Jesus said.
[03:11:48.027 --> 03:11:48.948]  Jesus said in verse 19,
[03:11:49.927 --> 03:11:54.852]  Whoa unto them that are gifts with child, and that are giving suck in these days.
[03:11:54.852 --> 03:11:58.375]  In other words, Jesus is saying, unfortunately, curse to those parents.
[03:11:58.375 --> 03:12:07.864]  He said this 2,023 years ago, because now you're seeing why he said that about the kids and the parents, because Satan's aggressive plan is to go after the kids.
[03:12:10.514 --> 03:12:13.575]  And now Bill Gates has said the next virus will attack children.
[03:12:13.575 --> 03:12:16.456]  Brother, I hear you and I appreciate you and I agree.
[03:12:16.456 --> 03:12:21.918]  Our faith should not be in Trump, it should be in God and justice and ourselves and our actions.
[03:12:21.918 --> 03:12:25.039]  And I do not trust Trump and I do not trust Elon Musk or any of them.
[03:12:25.039 --> 03:12:27.680]  I'm simply pointing out who's saying good things, who's saying bad things.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:32.481]  We're going to skip this network break so that Gerald Solente gets his time back.
[03:12:32.481 --> 03:12:35.842]  TrendsResearch.com, the great Gerald Solente takes over.
[03:12:35.842 --> 03:12:37.123]  Gerald Solente, we love you, go ahead.
[03:12:38.557 --> 03:12:40.858]  Thank you, and thank you for all that you do.
[03:12:40.858 --> 03:12:59.688]  And, you know, there was an article, every day I go to InfoWars, and there was an article up there this morning about Janet Yellen, Janet Yellen Yellen, about the dollar and where is it going.
[03:12:59.688 --> 03:13:02.730]  Very interesting article.
[03:13:02.730 --> 03:13:06.632]  And if you look at the cover of our Trends Journal magazine,
[03:13:08.346 --> 03:13:10.768]  It's death of the dollar.
[03:13:10.768 --> 03:13:15.593]  And that was out two weeks ago.
[03:13:15.593 --> 03:13:18.275]  The dollar is dying.
[03:13:18.275 --> 03:13:19.677]  There it is.
[03:13:19.677 --> 03:13:22.980]  In God we don't trust.
[03:13:22.980 --> 03:13:31.468]  And again, very important article on InfoWars, and I go there every day to see what they have up there, and I get a lot of information.
[03:13:31.468 --> 03:13:31.748]  Quote.
[03:13:32.799 --> 03:13:42.927]  There is a risk when we use financial sanctions that are linked to the role of the dollar, that over time, it could undermine the hegemony of the dollar.
[03:13:42.927 --> 03:13:45.469]  Miss Yellen, Miss Fatsia Brut.
[03:13:45.469 --> 03:13:47.850]  Man, we're the same age.
[03:13:47.850 --> 03:13:49.332]  Don't look like her, man.
[03:13:49.332 --> 03:13:50.292]  Whoa!
[03:13:50.292 --> 03:13:54.155]  Yeah, that's the crap spewing out of her mouth.
[03:13:54.155 --> 03:13:57.138]  And get this straight, everybody.
[03:13:57.138 --> 03:14:01.441]  You're all listening to InfoWars, so you got a brain.
[03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:07.500]  If you got a brain bigger than a pea, I mean, look at this.
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:13.622]  How can you believe, how can you believe the garbage spewing out of her mouth?
[03:14:13.622 --> 03:14:15.503]  This is the yelling they yelled.
[03:14:15.503 --> 03:14:21.145]  Hey, Celente, what do you know?
[03:14:21.145 --> 03:14:24.107]  Your magazine, you're 100% wrong.
[03:14:24.107 --> 03:14:26.028]  There is no inflation.
[03:14:26.028 --> 03:14:31.770]  It's only temporary, only transitory, only transgender-tory.
[03:14:33.968 --> 03:14:42.773]  This Janet Yellen now, yelling about the words are perfect.
[03:14:42.773 --> 03:14:45.794]  The words are perfect.
[03:14:45.794 --> 03:14:49.777]  There is a risk when we use financial sanctions.
[03:14:49.777 --> 03:14:52.718]  Oh, when we use financial sanctions?
[03:14:52.718 --> 03:15:03.184]  You mean you arrogant public servants that are putting sanctions on Russia, that are costing everybody and doing nothing?
[03:15:04.238 --> 03:15:09.579]  So going back to being a dumbbell, what was Yellen's last job?
[03:15:09.579 --> 03:15:11.659]  Oh, the Fed head.
[03:15:11.659 --> 03:15:15.520]  You mean the Fed head is now our Secretary of the Treasury?
[03:15:15.520 --> 03:15:17.360]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:15:17.360 --> 03:15:20.821]  They tell us what to do.
[03:15:20.821 --> 03:15:24.662]  Again, just had Easter time.
[03:15:24.662 --> 03:15:28.802]  Jesus Christ driving the money changers out of the temple.
[03:15:28.802 --> 03:15:31.403]  That's the Feds, boys and girls.
[03:15:33.911 --> 03:15:38.815]  That's the Jamie Dimon gang!
[03:15:38.815 --> 03:15:41.116]  The Goldman Sachs gang!
[03:15:41.116 --> 03:15:44.879]  The Merrill Lynch mob!
[03:15:44.879 --> 03:15:47.301]  And that's who's in charge.
[03:15:47.301 --> 03:15:53.986]  But what she's saying about hegemony ain't only dollar hegemony, it's war hegemony.
[03:15:53.986 --> 03:15:58.509]  We'll be right back and tell you more about what's going on.
[03:16:04.127 --> 03:16:06.248]  Gerald, you're off to about three in the middle of the mix here.
[03:16:06.248 --> 03:16:08.108]  We skipped the network break so you'd have more time.
[03:16:08.108 --> 03:16:08.588]  Oh, okay.
[03:16:08.588 --> 03:16:09.188]  You're still on there.
[03:16:09.188 --> 03:16:10.389]  Go ahead.
[03:16:10.389 --> 03:16:10.949]  Okay, thanks.
[03:16:10.949 --> 03:16:12.549]  So there she is, Ms.
[03:16:12.549 --> 03:16:13.870]  Fajarbooth.
[03:16:13.870 --> 03:16:17.551]  How can you listen to the crap spewing out of the mouth of these people?
[03:16:17.551 --> 03:16:25.213]  So now she's talking about undermining the hegemony of the dollar.
[03:16:25.213 --> 03:16:30.574]  The world is disgusted with the United States' hegemony.
[03:16:31.385 --> 03:16:33.646]  Hey, what's your favorite war?
[03:16:33.646 --> 03:16:34.827]  What's your favorite war?
[03:16:34.827 --> 03:16:36.188]  Well, I like the Korean War.
[03:16:36.188 --> 03:16:39.049]  No, the Ukraine War was a great war.
[03:16:39.049 --> 03:16:41.511]  The Vietnam War.
[03:16:41.511 --> 03:16:44.292]  Oh, yeah, only killed about 60,000 Americans.
[03:16:44.292 --> 03:16:49.455]  Wounded over almost a quarter of a million more.
[03:16:49.455 --> 03:16:53.757]  Only killed three million people over there in Vietnam.
[03:16:53.757 --> 03:16:56.519]  I like the first Iraq War!
[03:16:56.519 --> 03:16:58.100]  Hell with you, Salenti!
[03:16:58.100 --> 03:17:00.141]  I like the second Iraq War!
[03:17:02.148 --> 03:17:05.529]  They're going to get that guy Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
[03:17:05.529 --> 03:17:08.610]  We're going to Afghanistan.
[03:17:08.610 --> 03:17:11.271]  Try finding it on the map.
[03:17:11.271 --> 03:17:13.972]  Like you can find Ukraine on the map?
[03:17:13.972 --> 03:17:17.914]  The world is disgusted with United States hegemony.
[03:17:19.011 --> 03:17:27.798]  If we don't reverse this, the fall of the American Empire is in front of our eyes.
[03:17:27.798 --> 03:17:38.107]  You look at these old movies about the fall of the Roman Empire, and you see the little clowns that were in their Senate and running the show.
[03:17:38.107 --> 03:17:40.849]  You think the picture's changed?
[03:17:40.849 --> 03:17:42.350]  Look at Mitch McConnell.
[03:17:42.350 --> 03:17:46.454]  You want to see a guy with more chins than Chinatown?
[03:17:46.454 --> 03:17:47.875]  How about Adam Schiff?
[03:17:51.966 --> 03:17:55.229]  How about, I'm Chuckie Schumer.
[03:17:55.229 --> 03:17:58.612]  I always talk to you like this with my glasses on.
[03:17:58.612 --> 03:18:02.776]  It's the fall of America in front of our eyes.
[03:18:02.776 --> 03:18:06.219]  Hey, how about Diane Not-So-Feinstein?
[03:18:06.219 --> 03:18:11.123]  Could hardly walk, can't talk, and they're telling us what to do?
[03:18:11.123 --> 03:18:15.347]  You got it?
[03:18:15.347 --> 03:18:18.950]  If we don't reverse this, it's over.
[03:18:19.921 --> 03:18:23.782]  The world is disgusted with America.
[03:18:23.782 --> 03:18:28.344]  The death of the dollar is on the doorstep.
[03:18:28.344 --> 03:18:29.764]  Look at this guy.
[03:18:29.764 --> 03:18:31.045]  Look at this guy.
[03:18:31.045 --> 03:18:34.546]  Look at this little nothing of a boy!
[03:18:34.546 --> 03:18:39.487]  And everybody, lock down your business.
[03:18:39.487 --> 03:18:41.208]  We got a COVID war to fight.
[03:18:42.586 --> 03:18:52.128]  Oh, you saw that stuff about Chicago with the hundreds of teenagers running out in the streets of downtown Chicago and smashing windows?
[03:18:52.128 --> 03:18:54.888]  Yeah, they went out of their mind when COVID came.
[03:18:54.888 --> 03:18:57.289]  This stuff wasn't happening before.
[03:18:57.289 --> 03:19:00.629]  All the stores closing down because of crime.
[03:19:00.629 --> 03:19:01.790]  Don't blame it on... Yeah.
[03:19:01.790 --> 03:19:04.330]  Oh, by the way, I was just in Chicago this weekend.
[03:19:04.330 --> 03:19:05.770]  I missed this.
[03:19:05.770 --> 03:19:07.931]  And I got to tell you, I had a great time.
[03:19:07.931 --> 03:19:09.831]  I spoke at the Mises Institute.
[03:19:10.990 --> 03:19:13.031]  The nightlife was great.
[03:19:13.031 --> 03:19:14.971]  Better than New York City.
[03:19:14.971 --> 03:19:18.892]  Old people, young people out on State Street.
[03:19:18.892 --> 03:19:21.112]  That great street, just want to say.
[03:19:21.112 --> 03:19:23.873]  It was great.
[03:19:23.873 --> 03:19:31.415]  We have to bring back the American spirit that these little clowns of nothing have robbed from us.
[03:19:31.415 --> 03:19:33.595]  You gotta support InfoWars.
[03:19:33.595 --> 03:19:39.737]  You have to do what we all need to do, and that is unite.
[03:19:40.476 --> 03:19:45.958]  Under one umbrella, a life, liberty, and a pursuit of happiness.
[03:19:45.958 --> 03:19:47.038]  Happiness?
[03:19:47.038 --> 03:19:47.658]  Happiness?
[03:19:47.658 --> 03:19:50.099]  Why, how dare you say happiness?
[03:19:50.099 --> 03:19:52.620]  That's a dirty word in America!
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:55.721]  I'm Gavin Newsom, I'll tell you what to do!
[03:19:55.721 --> 03:19:59.862]  I'm Witless Whitney, I'm a little Dwight in Ohio!
[03:19:59.862 --> 03:20:01.822]  You better grow up, everybody!
[03:20:01.822 --> 03:20:06.284]  The end is near, and we have to change it.
[03:20:06.284 --> 03:20:06.864]  It's up to us.
[03:20:11.243 --> 03:20:16.566]  So, how do we do it?
[03:20:16.566 --> 03:20:19.607]  I believe we need a new third party.
[03:20:19.607 --> 03:20:27.451]  And, you know, I was on with Alex back in early January, I think it was.
[03:20:27.451 --> 03:20:39.517]  And earlier in December, when I was doing InfoWars, and I had forecast that to me the best presidential candidates would be RFK Jr.
[03:20:40.908 --> 03:20:46.192]  The President, Judge Andrew Napolitano, for Vice President.
[03:20:46.192 --> 03:20:54.237]  And on the 19th, Kennedy's going to officially announce that he's running for President.
[03:20:54.237 --> 03:20:57.299]  Remember, think about this.
[03:20:57.299 --> 03:21:03.143]  Suppose your father was assassinated.
[03:21:03.143 --> 03:21:09.607]  Suppose your uncle, who's President of the United States, boom, assassinated.
[03:21:11.940 --> 03:21:14.801]  What kind of heart would you have?
[03:21:14.801 --> 03:21:16.201]  You'd be a different kind of person?
[03:21:16.201 --> 03:21:18.662]  Of course.
[03:21:18.662 --> 03:21:21.843]  And he came out, by the way, he's coming out against the Ukraine war.
[03:21:21.843 --> 03:21:27.525]  He's coming out against the digital coins.
[03:21:27.525 --> 03:21:31.967]  And you know his stand on vaxes.
[03:21:31.967 --> 03:21:34.187]  And people say, I don't like him because of climate change.
[03:21:34.187 --> 03:21:37.568]  Look, I got my own problems too.
[03:21:37.568 --> 03:21:38.989]  But how about all the bigger issues?
[03:21:42.489 --> 03:21:44.549]  And again, they're deriding him.
[03:21:44.549 --> 03:21:47.530]  You read the headlines, they hardly came out.
[03:21:47.530 --> 03:21:50.751]  Again, this was Pei, I did this already, but I'll do it again.
[03:21:50.751 --> 03:21:57.853]  This was in the toilet paper record of the New York Times on Thursday, April 6th.
[03:21:57.853 --> 03:22:01.634]  Page A18, down the bottom.
[03:22:01.634 --> 03:22:06.035]  Kennedy Jr., Fauci critic, files to run for president.
[03:22:06.035 --> 03:22:07.595]  What do you got Fauci critic in there?
[03:22:07.595 --> 03:22:08.895]  Who wrote this?
[03:22:08.895 --> 03:22:11.696]  Oh, Trip Gabriel.
[03:22:11.696 --> 03:22:11.936]  Trip.
[03:22:12.751 --> 03:22:20.033]  Yeah, a dumb trip, a little propagandist trip to put a headline in there.
[03:22:20.033 --> 03:22:27.755]  What does this have to do with him being a Fauci critic?
[03:22:27.755 --> 03:22:29.055]  How about the bigger picture?
[03:22:29.055 --> 03:22:31.576]  Can we look at that?
[03:22:31.576 --> 03:22:34.917]  If we don't have a new third party, to me, it's a crime syndicate.
[03:22:34.917 --> 03:22:36.277]  And I've been in there.
[03:22:36.277 --> 03:22:41.319]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate, under Repulsive Gonzaga.
[03:22:43.902 --> 03:22:44.923]  Yeah.
[03:22:44.923 --> 03:22:45.563]  There you go.
[03:22:45.563 --> 03:22:47.224]  Another headline.
[03:22:47.224 --> 03:22:51.666]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., soon to announce White House run.
[03:22:51.666 --> 03:22:54.248]  Souls doubts about vaccine.
[03:22:54.248 --> 03:22:54.748]  Why?
[03:22:54.748 --> 03:22:56.349]  How dare you?
[03:22:56.349 --> 03:23:02.152]  How dare you sow a doubt about the crap that we shoved down your throat?
[03:23:02.152 --> 03:23:04.593]  What's the matter with you?
[03:23:04.593 --> 03:23:07.975]  Why don't you be a good American?
[03:23:07.975 --> 03:23:09.756]  Don't be a fighter.
[03:23:09.756 --> 03:23:10.957]  Be a coward.
[03:23:12.894 --> 03:23:16.717]  Suck it up and bow down!
[03:23:16.717 --> 03:23:19.579]  What's wrong with this country?
[03:23:19.579 --> 03:23:21.420]  You know what's wrong with it?
[03:23:21.420 --> 03:23:25.563]  Again, look at the clowns running the show.
[03:23:25.563 --> 03:23:29.726]  Little Marco Rubio on Teddy Cruz.
[03:23:29.726 --> 03:23:36.551]  Yeah, how about going on a sea cruise, man, and get the hell out of here.
[03:23:36.551 --> 03:23:38.713]  No talk about peace.
[03:23:38.713 --> 03:23:40.454]  No talk about building America.
[03:23:43.180 --> 03:23:45.122]  You know my stand.
[03:23:45.122 --> 03:23:47.003]  Occupy peace.
[03:23:47.003 --> 03:23:51.247]  Close all the bases overseas.
[03:23:51.247 --> 03:23:53.089]  What are we doing in Italy?
[03:23:53.089 --> 03:23:57.452]  Unless you're going there to eat and have a good time.
[03:23:57.452 --> 03:24:00.115]  What are we doing in Germany?
[03:24:00.115 --> 03:24:04.719]  What are we doing in some 70 foreign countries?
[03:24:04.719 --> 03:24:10.263]  With several hundred bases.
[03:24:10.263 --> 03:24:10.844]  Hegemony.
[03:24:11.829 --> 03:24:15.252]  They've had enough of American hegemony.
[03:24:15.252 --> 03:24:19.095]  I'm going to tell you when the dollar is going to die.
[03:24:19.095 --> 03:24:25.361]  The dollar is going to fall off the cliff when they go off the petrodollar.
[03:24:25.361 --> 03:24:27.723]  When will it happen?
[03:24:27.723 --> 03:24:30.305]  It's in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:24:30.305 --> 03:24:31.786]  You see the Saudis?
[03:24:31.786 --> 03:24:33.548]  Hey, the Iranians aren't so bad.
[03:24:34.167 --> 03:24:36.069]  Let's get together over here.
[03:24:36.069 --> 03:24:38.210]  All right, Assad over there in Syria.
[03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:41.172]  Let's clean the slate and let's go.
[03:24:41.172 --> 03:24:42.894]  Yeah, okay, China.
[03:24:42.894 --> 03:24:49.058]  We're going to start trading oil for renminbis, for your currency.
[03:24:49.058 --> 03:24:49.999]  Okay, Russia.
[03:24:49.999 --> 03:24:51.480]  Yeah, we'll go with the ruble.
[03:24:51.480 --> 03:24:52.801]  All right?
[03:24:52.801 --> 03:25:00.167]  Oh, and by the way, we the Saudis, we're lowering our oil production because the price is going down.
[03:25:01.215 --> 03:25:04.457]  They have all had enough of America.
[03:25:04.457 --> 03:25:11.160]  Because all we are bringing is, quote, freedom and democracy.
[03:25:11.160 --> 03:25:15.422]  That's the lie they use to go kill people in foreign countries.
[03:25:15.422 --> 03:25:23.146]  The other aspect of Occupy Peace is put our troops to work to rebuild this rotted infrastructure.
[03:25:23.146 --> 03:25:27.568]  A third world infrastructure.
[03:25:27.568 --> 03:25:28.028]  And what else?
[03:25:30.592 --> 03:25:32.512]  You wanna go to war?
[03:25:32.512 --> 03:25:33.693]  Hey!
[03:25:33.693 --> 03:25:34.233]  Hey!
[03:25:34.233 --> 03:25:39.214]  Hey, you little boys and girls!
[03:25:39.214 --> 03:25:46.475]  That haven't voted for a war since World War II against the Constitution!
[03:25:46.475 --> 03:25:49.836]  And give the power to some little freak!
[03:25:49.836 --> 03:25:53.917]  Like little Billy Clinton bombs away over Baghdad!
[03:25:53.917 --> 03:25:55.977]  Let's get rid of Yugoslavia!
[03:25:58.089 --> 03:25:59.832]  I want that guy Assad out of there.
[03:25:59.832 --> 03:26:01.755]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[03:26:01.755 --> 03:26:08.386]  Obama, Bush's wars, Biden sending us into Ukraine.
[03:26:09.562 --> 03:26:10.963]  You want to go to war?
[03:26:10.963 --> 03:26:12.524]  Let the people vote.
[03:26:12.524 --> 03:26:13.225]  Yeah.
[03:26:13.225 --> 03:26:14.786]  How about that, huh?
[03:26:14.786 --> 03:26:17.368]  Why, how dare you, Solenti?
[03:26:17.368 --> 03:26:31.317]  How dare you say the people should have a right to go fight and die, and that we should all have the right to steal every penny we can from them to give to the military-industrial complex?
[03:26:31.317 --> 03:26:34.079]  Let's kill Solenti.
[03:26:34.079 --> 03:26:39.203]  Give it to JFK, and he's a nobody compared to JFK, but he shoots his mouth off.
[03:26:40.026 --> 03:26:43.308]  Against the military-industrial complex.
[03:26:43.308 --> 03:26:44.910]  Well, we got Lloyd Austin!
[03:26:44.910 --> 03:26:46.651]  Lloyd Austin!
[03:26:46.651 --> 03:26:50.253]  Hey, Lloyd, is that door big enough for you to get through?
[03:26:50.253 --> 03:26:53.416]  Oh, the former general over there in Iraq?
[03:26:53.416 --> 03:26:55.977]  That's our defense secretary?
[03:26:55.977 --> 03:26:59.080]  Last job?
[03:26:59.080 --> 03:27:01.942]  Sitting on the board of directors of Raytheon.
[03:27:01.942 --> 03:27:06.525]  The second largest defense contractor in the United States.
[03:27:06.525 --> 03:27:08.046]  That's what's happened to America.
[03:27:09.804 --> 03:27:13.866]  No more money for the military-industrial complex!
[03:27:13.866 --> 03:27:14.766]  No more money!
[03:27:14.766 --> 03:27:15.886]  We got enough!
[03:27:15.886 --> 03:27:18.307]  Enough weapons!
[03:27:18.307 --> 03:27:23.469]  Let's rebuild America!
[03:27:23.469 --> 03:27:30.492]  Let's put every penny that we have into raising the spirit of this nation!
[03:27:30.492 --> 03:27:35.994]  Let's bring back the style, the grace, the dignity, the self-respect!
[03:27:36.775 --> 03:27:39.076]  Why, how dare you have self-respect?
[03:27:39.076 --> 03:27:43.098]  I'll tell you what to do!
[03:27:43.098 --> 03:27:46.199]  Look at the clown show!
[03:27:46.199 --> 03:27:49.400]  Look what the people look like!
[03:27:49.400 --> 03:27:57.043]  You know we're calling our rally on May 27th up here in Kingston, New York, our Peace and Freedom Rally?
[03:27:57.043 --> 03:27:59.404]  Make America healthy again.
[03:27:59.404 --> 03:28:01.025]  That's right.
[03:28:01.025 --> 03:28:03.606]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:28:04.702 --> 03:28:15.984]  Let's bring back the true American spirit that has been robbed from us by little clowns that imbeciles bow down and suck up to.
[03:28:15.984 --> 03:28:18.624]  Stand six feet apart!
[03:28:18.624 --> 03:28:26.546]  The wind blows exactly in straight lines at six feet, so the COVID won't get you.
[03:28:26.546 --> 03:28:32.487]  Put on your mask when you're in an airplane, but you can take it off when you're eating and drinking, because COVID knows when you're eating and drinking.
[03:28:34.474 --> 03:28:37.095]  Look at the imbeciles telling us what to do.
[03:28:37.095 --> 03:28:41.256]  And look at the imbeciles that follow.
[03:28:41.256 --> 03:28:44.537]  Again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:28:44.537 --> 03:28:45.077]  You know why?
[03:28:45.077 --> 03:28:49.859]  Because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:28:49.859 --> 03:28:52.780]  We're going to take a break.
[03:28:52.780 --> 03:28:53.460]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:57.814 --> 03:29:01.738]  1776 Testosterone Boost is back in stock.
[03:29:01.738 --> 03:29:07.905]  It is a private label of the number one best-selling natural testosterone booster on the market.
[03:29:07.905 --> 03:29:11.729]  It does incredible things for men, but women also love it.
[03:29:11.729 --> 03:29:15.753]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to experience this product for yourself.
[03:29:15.753 --> 03:29:19.057]  I never have any issues in the libido department.
[03:29:19.457 --> 03:29:24.321]  But it's always good to supercharge it and take it to the next level.
[03:29:24.321 --> 03:29:29.045]  And I'm just going to tell you bottom line, my wife is blown away.
[03:29:29.045 --> 03:29:32.568]  I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the sheets.
[03:29:32.568 --> 03:29:34.950]  And I'm telling you, at 49, I've got more energy
[03:29:36.812 --> 03:29:38.113]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[03:30:05.475 --> 03:30:06.816]  I want you all to know something.
[03:30:06.816 --> 03:30:08.778]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:08.778 --> 03:30:12.320]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:30:12.320 --> 03:30:15.443]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:30:15.443 --> 03:30:19.686]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:30:19.686 --> 03:30:21.908]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:21.908 --> 03:30:25.430]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:30:25.430 --> 03:30:28.873]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:30:29.153 --> 03:30:32.014]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:30:32.014 --> 03:30:33.055]  Years ago.
[03:30:33.055 --> 03:30:35.116]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:30:35.116 --> 03:30:37.117]  Not for a second.
[03:30:37.117 --> 03:30:39.638]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:30:39.638 --> 03:30:42.099]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:30:42.099 --> 03:30:45.221]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.221 --> 03:30:46.781]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:30:46.781 --> 03:30:49.863]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:30:59.159 --> 03:31:08.866]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars, for decades, has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[03:31:08.866 --> 03:31:12.549]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:31:12.549 --> 03:31:19.494]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsStore.com to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[03:31:20.034 --> 03:31:24.275]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.

[03:31:29.297 --> 03:31:31.018]  Cardiovascular, critical.

[03:31:39.080 --> 03:31:48.043]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, and I'm not gonna sign anymore after that, are exclusively available at infowarestore.com as well.
[03:31:48.203 --> 03:31:50.645]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:31:50.645 --> 03:31:51.526]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:31:51.526 --> 03:31:53.068]  But now, I signed the last books.
[03:31:53.068 --> 03:31:57.512]  You can get them right now.
[03:31:57.512 --> 03:32:04.178]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:32:04.178 --> 03:32:06.120]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:32:06.120 --> 03:32:07.621]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:32:07.621 --> 03:32:10.424]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:32:10.424 --> 03:32:12.425]  And it says, political prisoner.
[03:32:13.206 --> 03:32:15.167]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:32:15.167 --> 03:32:17.608]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:32:17.608 --> 03:32:19.749]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:32:19.749 --> 03:32:25.132]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:32:25.132 --> 03:32:26.332]  Jail background.
[03:32:26.332 --> 03:32:27.393]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:32:27.393 --> 03:32:31.515]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:32:31.515 --> 03:32:33.115]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:32:33.115 --> 03:32:34.136]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:32:34.136 --> 03:32:36.697]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:32:36.697 --> 03:32:37.477]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:32:37.477 --> 03:32:38.358]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:32:39.038 --> 03:32:43.759]  2024 it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt great way to fund the operation.
[03:32:43.759 --> 03:32:58.283]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:32:58.283 --> 03:33:04.185]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:17.982 --> 03:33:22.065]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:22.065 --> 03:33:32.453]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:32.453 --> 03:33:35.295]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.295 --> 03:33:37.897]  And like I said, you know, do everything you can to support Infowars.
[03:33:37.897 --> 03:33:41.439]  You know, we're in the fight for our lives.
[03:33:41.439 --> 03:33:45.362]  And it's just so sad to see what's happened to this country.
[03:33:45.362 --> 03:33:46.183]  It breaks my heart.
[03:33:47.293 --> 03:33:49.213]  And I just watch it go lower and lower.
[03:33:49.213 --> 03:34:05.616]  And as I keep saying, that great quote, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[03:34:05.616 --> 03:34:15.258]  And, you know, there's Colonel Douglas MacArthur, and of course he's been on Infowars, and I've had him on as well on my podcast with friends.
[03:34:16.377 --> 03:34:22.622]  And he did a podcast with Judge Andrew Napolitano last Wednesday.
[03:34:22.622 --> 03:34:28.447]  And he was talking about the Ukraine war.
[03:34:28.447 --> 03:34:33.392]  This isn't the exact quote, but you know, paraphrase what he said.
[03:34:33.392 --> 03:34:35.874]  He did use the word lie.
[03:34:35.874 --> 03:34:38.756]  He said, they're lying to us.
[03:34:38.756 --> 03:34:43.100]  Everyone in the government is lying to us about the Ukraine war.
[03:34:46.280 --> 03:35:01.910]  He said the only way, basically, that this country could advance and stop this, the only one way it could stop, he said the American people could do it.
[03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:05.012]  It has to be the American people to do it.
[03:35:05.012 --> 03:35:08.534]  And I agree with him 100%.
[03:35:08.534 --> 03:35:09.955]  What political parties?
[03:35:09.955 --> 03:35:11.256]  It's not a party.
[03:35:11.256 --> 03:35:13.097]  You're having a party on our dollar.
[03:35:14.298 --> 03:35:15.219]  Again, I was there.
[03:35:15.219 --> 03:35:18.460]  I was in the New York State Senate at the top.
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:19.621]  You know, with the top guy.
[03:35:19.621 --> 03:35:23.083]  Now, I wasn't at the top, but I was with the top.
[03:35:23.083 --> 03:35:25.604]  Secretary of the New York State Senate, Al Abrams.
[03:35:25.604 --> 03:35:26.265]  Wonderful guy.
[03:35:26.265 --> 03:35:27.626]  May he rest in peace.
[03:35:27.626 --> 03:35:31.448]  I'm, you know, I'm his assistant.
[03:35:31.448 --> 03:35:32.789]  He's the guy running the whole show.
[03:35:32.789 --> 03:35:41.373]  I'm eating shrimp cocktail with Malcolm Wilson, who was the president, the governor at the time.
[03:35:41.373 --> 03:35:42.214]  Majority leader.
[03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:44.680]  I was there at the time.
[03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:45.301]  I got to see it.
[03:35:45.301 --> 03:35:47.561]  I tell you, I was just in Chicago.
[03:35:47.561 --> 03:35:52.682]  I got the picture of me and Ronald Reagan when I picked him up to Chicago Hilton.
[03:35:52.682 --> 03:35:53.822]  I was 30 years old.
[03:35:53.822 --> 03:36:01.984]  I put on a brunch for him and 16 of our board of directors.
[03:36:01.984 --> 03:36:05.065]  Two days before he's announcing he's running against Gerald Ford.
[03:36:12.566 --> 03:36:18.628]  Drank wine with the Prince of Norway.
[03:36:18.628 --> 03:36:21.009]  I've been there.
[03:36:21.009 --> 03:36:27.110]  It's up to we the people, not the establishment.
[03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:31.012]  And Infowars is outside the establishment, so too is the Trends Journal.
[03:36:31.012 --> 03:36:42.155]  You know, I was looking at articles over here and one came up about how the cable news ratings are going up because they keep talking about the Trump
[03:36:43.172 --> 03:37:05.479]  And what's going on with Trump has absolutely nothing to do with the socio-economic future in terms of where the economy is going, where interest rates are going, where gold is going, where oil is going, where anything is going.
[03:37:05.479 --> 03:37:11.541]  Knowing a lot about this information does nothing for a Trends Journal subscriber about Trump.
[03:37:12.947 --> 03:37:17.230]  I want to know more about what's going on with the dollar, as I was talking about.
[03:37:17.230 --> 03:37:19.392]  The death of the dollar.
[03:37:19.392 --> 03:37:21.413]  It's happened.
[03:37:21.413 --> 03:37:28.718]  This guy Lula, the president of Brazil, as you know, he went to China.
[03:37:28.718 --> 03:37:33.521]  And he basically said, we had enough of America.
[03:37:33.521 --> 03:37:39.846]  And he goes on to say, again paraphrasing, because he said, go to sleep every night.
[03:37:41.124 --> 03:37:46.606]  And I said, why are we using the dollar?
[03:37:46.606 --> 03:37:48.287]  They've had it.
[03:37:48.287 --> 03:37:50.828]  It's over.
[03:37:50.828 --> 03:37:52.349]  It's the death of the dollar.
[03:37:52.349 --> 03:37:56.211]  So what do you do?
[03:37:56.211 --> 03:37:58.652]  We don't give financial advice.
[03:37:58.652 --> 03:38:00.953]  I'll tell you what I do.
[03:38:00.953 --> 03:38:06.735]  Other than guns, gold and a getaway plan.
[03:38:06.735 --> 03:38:08.316]  And on the gold end,
[03:38:09.053 --> 03:38:13.314]  I'm going to make this very simple and very clear.
[03:38:13.314 --> 03:38:17.615]  Going back to Yellen who's always yelling out some garbage.
[03:38:17.615 --> 03:38:25.978]  She's also saying that maybe the Fed won't be raising interest rates on May 3rd.
[03:38:25.978 --> 03:38:31.639]  Then you got others coming out in the Fed gang that say they're going to be raising them.
[03:38:31.639 --> 03:38:35.820]  So here's the story.
[03:38:35.820 --> 03:38:37.701]  If they raise interest rates
[03:38:39.354 --> 03:38:43.857]  25 basis points on May 3rd.
[03:38:43.857 --> 03:38:49.160]  Gold prices are going to go down.
[03:38:49.160 --> 03:38:51.442]  Markets will go down.
[03:38:51.442 --> 03:38:54.064]  The economy will go down.
[03:38:54.064 --> 03:39:01.749]  The higher interest rates go, the deeper gold in the economy fall.
[03:39:01.749 --> 03:39:03.090]  For gold temporarily.
[03:39:03.090 --> 03:39:06.072]  For the economy a longer time.
[03:39:06.690 --> 03:39:10.432]  You look at the retail sales numbers coming out.
[03:39:10.432 --> 03:39:13.613]  When you put inflation in it, negative.
[03:39:13.613 --> 03:39:21.256]  And when you put the real inflation number in, according to John Williams' shadow stats, it's negative, negative.
[03:39:21.256 --> 03:39:32.741]  And then you put the real inflation numbers in and what do they say came up inflation was like the core 5.5 or something like that last week.
[03:39:32.741 --> 03:39:35.122]  Again, you put the real number in there, it's more than double.
[03:39:36.181 --> 03:39:38.662]  But where did wages, how much did wages go up?
[03:39:38.662 --> 03:39:38.902]  Oh, 4.2%?
[03:39:38.902 --> 03:39:49.025]  So you mean you're earning less, and it costs you more to buy stuff.
[03:39:49.025 --> 03:39:53.146]  So you're buying less and it's costing you more.
[03:39:53.146 --> 03:39:59.868]  Going back to the interest rates, and back to gold.
[03:39:59.868 --> 03:40:05.130]  The deeper the economy sinks, the higher gold prices are going to go.
[03:40:06.084 --> 03:40:08.845]  Again, that's our trend forecast.
[03:40:08.845 --> 03:40:10.985]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[03:40:10.985 --> 03:40:15.806]  There are no advertisers in the Trends Journal.
[03:40:15.806 --> 03:40:27.829]  We're not selling you anything other than in-depth socioeconomic and geopolitical trends analysis and trend forecasts you won't find anywhere else in the world.
[03:40:27.829 --> 03:40:30.730]  So we're not selling you anything.
[03:40:30.730 --> 03:40:33.431]  Now, let's go back to interest rates.
[03:40:33.431 --> 03:40:34.651]  Should they raise them
[03:40:36.238 --> 03:40:42.580]  On May 3rd, our forecast is the end.
[03:40:42.580 --> 03:40:47.121]  Last time they raised them.
[03:40:47.121 --> 03:40:49.542]  They're going to start lowering them.
[03:40:49.542 --> 03:40:57.364]  They're going to lower them in anticipation of the Presidential Reality Show in 2024.
[03:40:57.364 --> 03:41:00.965]  Again, who's your Treasury Secretary?
[03:41:00.965 --> 03:41:01.945]  Scream and yelling.
[03:41:05.339 --> 03:41:06.480]  Where was she before?
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:12.465]  The Fed head.
[03:41:12.465 --> 03:41:14.767]  The Federal Reserve head.
[03:41:14.767 --> 03:41:19.151]  So anybody could see who's running our country.
[03:41:19.151 --> 03:41:22.213]  The bankster gangsters.
[03:41:22.213 --> 03:41:23.775]  And they're going to want to stay in power.
[03:41:23.775 --> 03:41:25.356]  They want to keep yelling there.
[03:41:25.356 --> 03:41:27.378]  They don't want to put anybody else in there.
[03:41:27.378 --> 03:41:31.942]  They're going to lower interest rates and the buildup
[03:41:33.430 --> 03:41:38.656]  To the Presidential Reality Show in 2024, so they boost the economy.
[03:41:38.656 --> 03:41:40.698]  What does that mean?
[03:41:40.698 --> 03:41:44.042]  Inflation starts going back up again.
[03:41:44.042 --> 03:41:47.246]  That's right.
[03:41:47.246 --> 03:41:52.091]  Inflation goes up, the higher it goes, the higher gold prices go.
[03:41:52.091 --> 03:41:53.773]  Gold prices should be much higher.
[03:41:55.482 --> 03:41:56.903]  I believe the game is rigged.
[03:41:56.903 --> 03:42:04.046]  That is not a conspiracy theory, considering that the Goldman Sachs gang was fined 900 million dollars.
[03:42:04.046 --> 03:42:05.647]  Not the Goldman Sachs gang, excuse me.
[03:42:05.647 --> 03:42:12.230]  The JPMorgan Chase was fined 900 million dollars for rigging the precious metals market.
[03:42:12.230 --> 03:42:13.571]  That's a fact.
[03:42:13.571 --> 03:42:15.792]  Five felonies convicted.
[03:42:15.792 --> 03:42:17.793]  Jamie Dimon doesn't go to jail.
[03:42:17.793 --> 03:42:18.353]  Where were you?
[03:42:18.353 --> 03:42:20.214]  How many drinks did you have?
[03:42:20.214 --> 03:42:22.655]  Yeah, get your hand cuffed, throw you in jail.
[03:42:24.078 --> 03:42:30.404]  You're 0.00% over the drinking limit.
[03:42:30.404 --> 03:42:33.987]  So anyway, that's how we see the economic situation.
[03:42:33.987 --> 03:42:38.612]  But the big bust is yet to come.
[03:42:38.612 --> 03:42:42.655]  And when we come back, we're going to tell you where it's going to come from.
[03:42:42.655 --> 03:42:43.056]  And again,
[03:42:45.748 --> 03:42:52.233]  Do what you can to support InfoWars, because the staff, Alex Jones, are doing everything they can to support you.
[03:42:52.233 --> 03:42:57.597]  Be right back.
[03:42:57.597 --> 03:43:04.242]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:43:04.242 --> 03:43:06.183]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:43:06.183 --> 03:43:07.684]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[03:43:07.684 --> 03:43:10.466]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:43:10.466 --> 03:43:12.488]  And it says, political prisoner.
[03:43:13.268 --> 03:43:15.229]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:17.671]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:43:17.671 --> 03:43:19.812]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:43:19.812 --> 03:43:25.195]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:43:25.195 --> 03:43:26.416]  Jail background.
[03:43:26.416 --> 03:43:27.456]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:43:27.456 --> 03:43:31.599]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:43:31.599 --> 03:43:33.200]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:43:33.200 --> 03:43:34.220]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:43:34.220 --> 03:43:36.762]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:43:36.762 --> 03:43:37.542]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:43:37.542 --> 03:43:38.423]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:43:39.364 --> 03:43:41.966]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:43:41.966 --> 03:43:43.847]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:43:43.847 --> 03:43:53.114]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:43:57.637 --> 03:44:01.662]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:44:01.662 --> 03:44:05.547]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:44:05.547 --> 03:44:07.930]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:44:07.930 --> 03:44:10.332]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:44:10.332 --> 03:44:12.855]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:44:13.636 --> 03:44:18.118]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:44:18.118 --> 03:44:21.500]  The BIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:44:21.500 --> 03:44:25.562]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:44:25.562 --> 03:44:28.143]  It was almost as if it were a plan in quotes.
[03:44:28.143 --> 03:44:29.204]  It just can't end.
[03:44:33.443 --> 03:44:35.565]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:44:35.565 --> 03:44:37.206]  They are nothing but distraction.
[03:44:37.206 --> 03:44:40.550]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:41.891]  You silenced those voices.
[03:44:41.891 --> 03:44:45.514]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:44:45.514 --> 03:44:52.081]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these bloodlust start going to prison!
[03:44:57.352 --> 03:45:02.373]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.

[03:45:39.892 --> 03:45:40.753]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:45:40.753 --> 03:45:41.714]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:45:41.714 --> 03:45:42.895]  They go good with this.
[03:45:42.895 --> 03:45:44.917]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:45:45.658 --> 03:45:47.120]  This is the Boss.
[03:45:47.120 --> 03:45:47.861]  TurboForce.

[03:47:23.843 --> 03:47:30.347]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.347 --> 03:47:34.450]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:47:37.356 --> 03:47:40.197]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:40.197 --> 03:47:49.782]  You know, I mentioned I was in Chicago, you know, this past weekend, and I'm checking out all the bars and things, not all of them, but as many as I could do.
[03:47:49.782 --> 03:48:00.067]  I like to go to clubs and hear different things, and I went to this one place, and as I'm walking out, this guy comes running out after me, Mr. Salenti, Mr. Salenti.
[03:48:01.212 --> 03:48:03.835]  He said, I watch you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:03.835 --> 03:48:05.196]  Oh, we love you on there.
[03:48:05.196 --> 03:48:07.078]  And he brought me back and he wanted me to meet his wife.
[03:48:07.078 --> 03:48:10.802]  They were from Florida and they were up there in a convention.
[03:48:10.802 --> 03:48:17.169]  So, you know, I, I, I appreciate InfoWars and that's why I do it.
[03:48:17.169 --> 03:48:19.792]  And so does so many other people.
[03:48:19.792 --> 03:48:22.815]  So you need to do all you can to keep the truth alive.
[03:48:24.738 --> 03:48:27.540]  And one of the ways you do it is by buying their great products.
[03:48:27.540 --> 03:48:29.641]  And they have these great sales going on.
[03:48:29.641 --> 03:48:31.302]  And the great products.
[03:48:31.302 --> 03:48:37.805]  And the big one now, they got one of the big ones is they're introducing this new Turbo Force Plus.
[03:48:37.805 --> 03:48:39.767]  And you get this from Infowars Life.
[03:48:39.767 --> 03:48:42.608]  I mean the products they're making over here and putting out.
[03:48:42.608 --> 03:48:45.210]  And this is really an advanced formula.
[03:48:45.210 --> 03:48:49.252]  And it's for optimum focus and energy.
[03:48:49.252 --> 03:48:50.312]  So you get it now and you get 25% off.
[03:48:51.943 --> 03:48:53.684]  And again, who doesn't want more power?
[03:48:53.684 --> 03:48:55.044]  Who doesn't want more strength?
[03:48:55.044 --> 03:48:57.225]  Who doesn't want more energy?
[03:48:57.225 --> 03:49:04.387]  So when it comes to regaining energy, you know, one of the ways to make it easy is with convenience.
[03:49:04.387 --> 03:49:08.769]  And, you know, you can have coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled products.
[03:49:08.769 --> 03:49:11.350]  They give you a short boost, but it's a fake one.
[03:49:11.350 --> 03:49:13.671]  It's a heavy downsize.
[03:49:13.671 --> 03:49:17.232]  And that's why their team of scientists work with the InfoWars crew to create
[03:49:17.694 --> 03:49:21.597]  This powerhouse of mixable energy formulas.
[03:49:21.597 --> 03:49:34.548]  You got vitamin C, A, B vitamins, essential B vitamins, vascular support, B6, and which helps with metabolism.
[03:49:34.548 --> 03:49:39.092]  One great thing for you to help build your amino acids, other products.
[03:49:39.092 --> 03:49:44.316]  So you really want to get this as green tea, leaf extract, it's filled with everything, you know.

[03:50:08.048 --> 03:50:11.370]  You get that 25% off.
[03:50:11.370 --> 03:50:14.191]  And the only place you could get it is at InfoWars.
[03:50:15.220 --> 03:50:19.381]  Store.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:50:19.381 --> 03:50:27.564]  So, do what you can to get more power, more strength, more energy, and to keep helping InfoWars.
[03:50:27.564 --> 03:50:30.224]  There you got it.
[03:50:30.224 --> 03:50:41.448]  So, I want to keep staying on this, and I'll move forward from it, but on the death of the dollar.
[03:50:41.448 --> 03:50:42.368]  This is an article
[03:50:46.408 --> 03:50:54.256]  From the Financial Times, April 12th, not too long ago.
[03:50:54.256 --> 03:51:02.245]  Renminbi's share of trade finance doubles since start of Ukraine war.
[03:51:02.245 --> 03:51:08.512]  Idiot Yellen screaming before saying this stupid statement that
[03:51:09.147 --> 03:51:17.372]  There is a risk when we use financial sanctions that are linked to the role of the dollar that over time can undermine the hegemony of the dollar.
[03:51:17.372 --> 03:51:20.835]  So why did you put these sanctions on Russia?
[03:51:20.835 --> 03:51:22.336]  Who's it hurting?
[03:51:22.336 --> 03:51:25.638]  Hasn't changed the Ukraine war?
[03:51:25.638 --> 03:51:32.142]  Oh, all you people in Europe love those high energy prices and your skyrocketing inflation.
[03:51:32.142 --> 03:51:35.364]  Oh, and you're weakening currencies.
[03:51:35.364 --> 03:51:36.245]  So going back,
[03:51:37.133 --> 03:51:41.114]  The damage is in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:51:41.114 --> 03:51:43.435]  It's going to take a while.
[03:51:43.435 --> 03:51:45.896]  The dollar's still strong.
[03:51:45.896 --> 03:52:01.640]  But America is going in the same direction of the fall of the English Empire, the people our founding fathers fought against, who this nation has become.
[03:52:01.640 --> 03:52:04.441]  Remember the sun never set on the British Empire?
[03:52:05.177 --> 03:52:15.523]  We could go anywhere in the world, we speak so properly, and kill anybody that we want, and steal whatever we want to steal.
[03:52:15.523 --> 03:52:17.725]  We, we got the king.
[03:52:17.725 --> 03:52:18.365]  Here, king!
[03:52:18.365 --> 03:52:18.886]  Here, boy!
[03:52:18.886 --> 03:52:19.666]  Here, boy!
[03:52:19.666 --> 03:52:20.827]  Oh, they're royalty.
[03:52:20.827 --> 03:52:24.049]  They don't pee, they don't poo.
[03:52:24.049 --> 03:52:25.970]  We became them.
[03:52:25.970 --> 03:52:33.975]  We became the nation that we fought for our freedom against our founding fathers, with our hegemony all over the world.
[03:52:35.296 --> 03:52:40.957]  So this is the beginning of the end.
[03:52:40.957 --> 03:52:49.820]  Last week, little cut son Macron, that arrogant little boy, which I think he got a toupee on there.
[03:52:49.820 --> 03:52:52.520]  Yeah, little Rothschild boy.
[03:52:52.520 --> 03:52:55.721]  He went to China.
[03:52:55.721 --> 03:52:58.402]  And what did he say to President Xi afterwards?
[03:52:58.402 --> 03:52:59.042]  He said, well,
[03:53:00.865 --> 03:53:03.327]  You know, we don't have to stand with the United States.
[03:53:03.327 --> 03:53:06.409]  He used the term, quote, and not a quote.
[03:53:06.409 --> 03:53:10.773]  We are not, quote, a vassal of the United States.
[03:53:10.773 --> 03:53:13.715]  Huh.
[03:53:13.715 --> 03:53:15.276]  We want to be more friendly with China.
[03:53:15.276 --> 03:53:19.360]  How come?
[03:53:19.360 --> 03:53:23.403]  Oh, you got that those big luxury items that you sell over there?
[03:53:23.403 --> 03:53:28.747]  The biggest ones in the world?
[03:53:28.747 --> 03:53:29.888]  And you sell them to China?
[03:53:31.641 --> 03:53:38.284]  Who, before the COVID war, bought a third of the luxury items?
[03:53:38.284 --> 03:53:42.166]  What do you think he's making friends with China for?
[03:53:42.166 --> 03:53:44.508]  It's about the bottom line!
[03:53:44.508 --> 03:53:54.173]  You got it?
[03:53:54.173 --> 03:53:56.634]  The 20th century was the American century.
[03:53:57.472 --> 03:54:07.897]  Unfortunately, unless we change it, we the people of the United States, the InfoWarriors Plus, change it.
[03:54:07.897 --> 03:54:10.979]  The 20th century was the American century.
[03:54:10.979 --> 03:54:15.241]  The 21st century is going to be the Chinese century.
[03:54:15.241 --> 03:54:24.726]  Because the business of China is business, and the business of America is war.
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:39.086]  You know, there's this article about, you know, the China's Belt and Road Initiative and all these countries that owe about eight hundred and something billion dollars in debt because of all the construction work they're doing and rebuilding.
[03:54:39.086 --> 03:54:39.407]  Wow.
[03:54:39.407 --> 03:54:51.292]  That's less than the United States defense budget each year and you're making this headline news?
[03:54:51.292 --> 03:54:52.553]  I told you I was in Chicago.
[03:54:52.553 --> 03:54:53.594]  I had a great time.
[03:54:53.594 --> 03:54:54.154]  I lived there for
[03:54:54.716 --> 03:54:58.559]  Six, seven years back in the 70s.
[03:54:58.559 --> 03:54:59.480]  And I'm out there.
[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:00.921]  It's a beautiful day.
[03:55:00.921 --> 03:55:01.581]  Lunchtime.
[03:55:01.581 --> 03:55:06.565]  And all these beautiful restaurants.
[03:55:06.565 --> 03:55:10.548]  Chairs on top of the, you know, folded back on the tables.
[03:55:10.548 --> 03:55:12.790]  No lunch is being served.
[03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:15.032]  I'm asking everybody around.
[03:55:15.032 --> 03:55:17.914]  Oh, the office occupancy rate is so low.
[03:55:17.914 --> 03:55:19.235]  People aren't eating lunch anymore.
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:36.069]  According to the numbers, CASTLE, K-A-S-T-L-E systems, the office occupancy rate in the top 10 cities of America is 49%.
[03:55:36.069 --> 03:55:37.991]  I've been saying this over and over again.
[03:55:37.991 --> 03:55:40.773]  We're the only ones reporting it now.
[03:55:40.773 --> 03:55:44.275]  And it's one of our top trends for 2023.
[03:55:44.275 --> 03:55:48.798]  Office building bust.
[03:55:48.798 --> 03:55:50.099]  The offices are empty.
[03:55:50.779 --> 03:55:53.281]  They have floating rates.
[03:55:53.281 --> 03:55:55.843]  I mentioned interest rates going up.
[03:55:55.843 --> 03:56:02.828]  The higher the interest rates go up, the more they have to pay on their debt on these buildings.
[03:56:02.828 --> 03:56:07.231]  And now the leases are all coming up one after another, year after year.
[03:56:07.231 --> 03:56:13.296]  And the people say, listen, I don't need 10 floors anymore, I only need two.
[03:56:17.341 --> 03:56:20.283]  And you know what the lease date people are coming back to work on?
[03:56:20.283 --> 03:56:21.044]  Monday.
[03:56:21.044 --> 03:56:22.585]  Uh, uh, Friday.
[03:56:22.585 --> 03:56:23.086]  Friday.
[03:56:23.086 --> 03:56:24.347]  Friday used to be happy hour.
[03:56:24.347 --> 03:56:27.209]  No more happy times.
[03:56:27.209 --> 03:56:29.030]  So.
[03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:31.492]  Start seeing the headlines.
[03:56:31.492 --> 03:56:39.458]  JPMorgan hints at coercion in ordering bankers back in office five days a week, financial times.
[03:56:39.458 --> 03:56:44.382]  You know why JPMorgan Chase is doing it?
[03:56:44.382 --> 03:56:46.264]  Where do you get your bank loan from?
[03:56:46.894 --> 03:56:49.035]  You get it from the banks.
[03:56:49.035 --> 03:56:50.336]  They know how bad it is.
[03:56:50.336 --> 03:56:53.318]  You're trying to get people to come back to work.
[03:56:53.318 --> 03:56:59.301]  The office building bust is going to crash banks like we've never seen before.
[03:56:59.301 --> 03:57:02.043]  One after another.
[03:57:02.043 --> 03:57:08.446]  People are hardly, the media when they talk about it, they only write little pieces about it.
[03:57:08.446 --> 03:57:13.529]  We are headed for the worst financial crisis in modern history.
[03:57:15.174 --> 03:57:17.175]  Prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:57:17.175 --> 03:57:19.876]  We're helping you do it with the Trends Journal.
[03:57:19.876 --> 03:57:22.998]  You go to TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:22.998 --> 03:57:25.579]  You read history before it happens.
[03:57:25.579 --> 03:57:27.980]  And we're doing it with InfoWars.
[03:57:27.980 --> 03:57:36.004]  The great articles that they put up, the great analysis they give, and they're covering so many different fields in so many different ways.
[03:57:36.004 --> 03:57:40.626]  So, support those who support you.
[03:57:40.626 --> 03:57:41.947]  We can change this.
[03:57:41.947 --> 03:57:43.988]  United we stand, divided we die.
[03:57:47.887 --> 03:57:51.009]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:57:51.009 --> 03:57:53.311]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:57:53.311 --> 03:57:57.254]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:57:57.254 --> 03:58:06.180]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:58:06.180 --> 03:58:13.966]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.

[03:58:27.459 --> 03:58:34.501]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.

[03:58:45.633 --> 03:58:46.735]  Please take action now.
