[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.197]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:23.298]  today.
[00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:31.018]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:33.016]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:35.897]  And it's Sunday, February 12th, 2023.
[00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:37.217]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.678]  I'll be here for the next two hours live.
[00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:42.198]  And then the great Owen Troyer will come in 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:45.919]  out of the same studio for Sunday live, all-time central.
[00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:54.352]   Well, while a lot of people are having fun, and I don't blame them, watching the Chiefs versus the Eagles, All of that that's going on.
[00:00:54.932 --> 00:01:11.122]  We're busy watching what's happening around the world with the New World Order and with all these UFOs that are flying around and all these shoot downs that are happening and taking place not just here but reportedly now starting over in China as well.
[00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:12.383]  What's really behind that?
[00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:17.706]   Well everybody from CNN The Fox News has been hyping.
[00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:19.029]  Could it be aliens?
[00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:28.470]   Even though in every case it turns out that it's a Chinese balloon carrying different surveillance and or Weapons packages.
[00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.391]  This has been going on for decades.
[00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.473]  The question is, why is it getting attention now?
[00:01:34.013 --> 00:01:38.556]  And that's because the Pentagon and the PSYOP experts want it to be getting attention now.
[00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:42.778]  Because the United States is doing giant drills right off the coast of China and Taiwan.
[00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:46.341]  And we've never been closer to war, according to our own hijacked government.
[00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:50.463]  And, of course, the globalist-run CHICOM government as well.
[00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:52.144]  Or, let's say, globalist-installed.
[00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:53.125]  They don't run it now.
[00:01:53.445 --> 00:02:01.272]   That's why war Is going from soft into hot big developments, obviously over in Ukraine.
[00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:11.301]  I believe we're just days away from the big second Russian invasion that I think will happen before the one year anniversary on the 24th.
[00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:15.445]  We're going to be looking at all of it here today.
[00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.002]  I want to thank you all for tuning in this evening.
[00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:26.824]  Remember, the establishment works around the clock to try to block this show and censor this show, so this is not a spectator sport.
[00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:29.864]  The Info War is about being the man and woman in the arena.
[00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:31.365]  It's very easy to be in the arena.
[00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:42.748]  Take the live links from InfoWars.com forward slash show, the live show feed from Band.Video, or places like conspiracyfact.info and share it from there and win the Info War.
[00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:44.231]  Against the New World Order.
[00:02:44.692 --> 00:02:51.570]  We've got so much to hit on the balloon situation and what I think is really behind that and what's behind the PsyOps coming up this evening.
[00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:58.616]  Then, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, governments are admitting they've been covertly censoring people with big tech.
[00:02:59.177 --> 00:02:59.237]  U.S.
[00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:02.840]  State Department funding secret disinformation crusade to blacklist conservatives.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.281]  I told you about that years ago.
[00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:05.582]  Now it's come out in Congress.
[00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:10.947]  We have some amazing clips from Friday that we didn't have time to get to because it was happening live as we were speaking.
[00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:13.229]  Also, Elon Musk retweeted a video.
[00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:23.059]  Montage yesterday of myself and Joe Rogan that was used to hype up the whole alien invasion narrative that is taking place.
[00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.424]  What we really have is an invasion of our privacy, an invasion of our bodies with the poison shots and the AI surveillance grid.
[00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:37.429]  And what we really have is an invasion of third world populations starving to death because the globalists shut down their countries for more than two years.
[00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.472]  The West was only shut down on average for about a year, the US only for about six months.
[00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:55.624]  Fully shut down, but we're gonna be looking at all of that today as well plus the exploding Crime rate thanks the Democrats defunding the police and telling police a slow roll Massive news on the whole poison shot front.
[00:03:55.644 --> 00:04:12.091]   We knew this was coming and whether it's people like the dictator of Venezuela Hugo Chavez or now socialist president Lula da Silva They're announcing forced injections of Pfizer shots Communists always closely allied with Big Pharma.
[00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:19.187]  For anyone that wants to ever have access to health care or any type of financial aid or support.
[00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:22.807]  And of course they're saying your children can't go to school if you don't take it.
[00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:24.667]  So that's where they want to bring us here.
[00:04:24.687 --> 00:04:26.448]  They're already trying it all around the world.
[00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:27.729]  Real tyranny.
[00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:38.912]  And there's been some new hearings with other top experts in the death actuary field, confirming the trend we've seen over two years, accelerating a massive increase in death of 150 plus percent.
[00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.804]  On the first shot alone, we've got all that.
[00:04:43.844 --> 00:04:48.130]  That's only a small window into what is coming up today.
[00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.036]  Hillary Clinton's giving a speech calling for banning cash, bringing cashless society, and so much more.
[00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:54.378]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:54.438 --> 00:04:55.900]  Thanks for joining us on Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:04.545]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:06.725]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:22.092]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:34.184]   So there is a steady stream of Chinese Communist balloons Coming in again, as I've told you, over the North Pole, down over Alaska, into Western Canada.
[00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:45.775]  And on Friday, and then again on Saturday, the United States shot down, using F-22 Raptors, two of those unidentified flying objects, which they now admit were balloons.
[00:05:47.731 --> 00:06:00.318]  They report that the avionics of the Sidewinder missiles were affected by what was on board, showing these things have some pretty sophisticated jamming on them, if you believe what we're hearing out of the Pentagon.
[00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:01.659]  They lie so much.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.240]  Who knows?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.822]  Like telling the troops the vaccine was tested and safe.
[00:06:06.262 --> 00:06:07.203]  It was all a damn lie.
[00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:08.443]  I don't dislike the troops.
[00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:10.645]  I love the troops and the folks in the military.
[00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:14.887]  Some of the best people in the country, but the folks running it are the enemies of the nation.
[00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:17.848]  That's how you bring a country down, is the enemies from within.
[00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:24.991]  So everywhere, Fox News, CNN, all of them have been hyping, is this an alien invasion?
[00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:33.795]  Even though by the end of Friday night, the Pentagon said it was another balloon, and by the end of Saturday night, the second one, okay, it was another balloon of some type.
[00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:39.478]  These much smaller than the gigantic one that was shot down last week.
[00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:43.053]  And the media is just all over the place on this.
[00:06:43.393 --> 00:06:44.954]  Project Bluebeam activated?
[00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:51.099]  Know all about the conspiracy theory going viral again after sightings of UFOs.
[00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:52.560]  That just means unidentified.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.741]  So you know what it is.
[00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:59.445]  I mean, if a jet's flying at 50,000 feet, they see it on radar until they visualize it.
[00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:00.566]  It doesn't have transponders.
[00:07:00.606 --> 00:07:01.887]  They say it's unidentified.
[00:07:01.907 --> 00:07:02.827]  It just means it's not identified.
[00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:08.912]  Going viral again after sightings of UFOs in the U.S., Canada, and China.
[00:07:09.932 --> 00:07:11.594]  And so now, as the U.S.
[00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:26.328]  and China move more into a war stance with each other, both in rhetoric and with military forces, this is a way to saber-rattle further, and then meanwhile have the corporate media tell you it might be little green men.
[00:07:26.748 --> 00:07:29.991]  Here's the Newsweek's headline, Alien Invasions.
[00:07:31.132 --> 00:07:34.956]  Congressman addresses speculation after UFOs shot down.
[00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:41.276]  UFOs are being shot down left and right, and the internet thinks an alien attack is imminent.
[00:07:44.937 --> 00:07:48.478]  Another suspected flying something goes down near Alaska.
[00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.620]  Amidst a possible alien invasion, Biden undermines all his prior statements.
[00:07:56.561 --> 00:08:13.987]   And so that's Red State and Town Hall and CNN and all of them A day after, and in the case of Friday's shoot down, two days after, the Pentagon admits they were balloons and have been recovering with debris, they don't care.
[00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.768]  They just keep saying UFO, UFO, UFO.
[00:08:16.848 --> 00:08:18.730]  The public thinks UFO means an alien.
[00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.391]  No, it just means unidentified.
[00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:26.494]  China now claiming it has also intercepted a UFO off their coast.
[00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:30.496]  Here's what we know about the unidentified object shot down over North America, CNN.
[00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:36.916]  Baffled pilots who shot down mystery objects say it interfered with their sensors.
[00:08:38.957 --> 00:08:39.197]  U.S.
[00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:42.138]  jet shoots down unidentified object over northern Canada.
[00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:47.219]  China scrambles fighter jets to shoot down unidentified objects over its airspace.
[00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:56.422]  NORAD declares false alarm over mysterious airborne object over Montana after congressman said DOD was waiting till morning to get eyes on it.
[00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.291]  That's another one they're saying.
[00:08:58.311 --> 00:09:00.093]  I guess that'd be three if that's true.
[00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:04.677]  Scientist alien concern after finding space object sending signals to Earth.
[00:09:06.138 --> 00:09:08.561]  That's out of the Daily Star in the UK.
[00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:16.067]  Scientist became concerned when she thought signals were being sent to Earth from space, being sent by aliens.
[00:09:16.168 --> 00:09:16.888]  It goes on from there.
[00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:21.773]  Of course it was just another deep space satellite.
[00:09:23.373 --> 00:09:27.015]  There are tens of thousands of different satellites that have been launched since the 60s.
[00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:28.616]  They're all over the place.
[00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:38.800]  And I liken a satellite to a neighbor you've got a quarter mile away who's got a big, powerful telescope on their deck.
[00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:42.844]   And if you've got a telescope like that, They're incredible.
[00:09:42.904 --> 00:09:43.784]  In fact, I have one.
[00:09:43.824 --> 00:09:44.944]  It's in stores where I have time to use it.
[00:09:44.964 --> 00:09:45.925]  Bought it back in college.
[00:09:46.845 --> 00:09:48.985]  And the stars are cool to look at with it.
[00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:49.785]  The planets are neat.
[00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:51.986]  You gotta be in really clear sky to do that.
[00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:53.866]  We drive out, you know, to the hill country sometimes.
[00:09:54.306 --> 00:10:02.007]  Me and my dad when I was in college and stay up all night out there drinking a couple beers and eating sandwiches and looking at the planets and things.
[00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:07.868]  But what telescopes are amazing for is up close and down on the ground.
[00:10:08.348 --> 00:10:10.229]  And you never really watch your neighbors.
[00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:11.289]  That's not fun to do.
[00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.271]  It's not as all people do is watch TV.
[00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:28.163]  But the geckos on the lamppost and the ants going across the windowsill and the possum digging in the trash can or the bobcat climbing on the roof.
[00:10:29.284 --> 00:10:31.365]  That's what telescopes are amazing for at night.
[00:10:32.727 --> 00:10:38.688]   And like in a Satellite up there, shooting down on a clear day.
[00:10:38.768 --> 00:10:42.531]  It can read, back in the 60s they could, the date on a penny or a dime.
[00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:48.036]  They can read what a woman laying in Central Park, famous photos of this from the late 60s, what she's reading.
[00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:50.118]  The text on a little paperback she's reading.
[00:10:51.141 --> 00:11:01.243]  But what balloons are for, obviously, is to get a better reading with ground-penetrating radar or with laser scans like we just saw over Kauai, Hawaii, a few days ago.
[00:11:01.283 --> 00:11:03.064]  And the Pentagon says it's a Chinese satellite.
[00:11:03.584 --> 00:11:06.145]  That's very, very serious.
[00:11:07.485 --> 00:11:12.146]  But again, this whole angle that it's aliens is just preposterous.
[00:11:12.186 --> 00:11:18.708]  But people don't get upset about their neighbor a half mile away looking at them through a telescope because they're usually not even aware of it.
[00:11:18.748 --> 00:11:20.568]  They can't see it unless they've got a telescope.
[00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:36.847]  But, imagine you're sitting there, in bed, and you're just getting to bed, you turn the lights out, and then you look over at the blinds, and there's a dude standing looking through your window.
[00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:40.290]  You get very, very upset.
[00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.251]  You get very, very angry.
[00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:44.214]  Somebody is in your territory, and you should.
[00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:47.013]  That's why people are so upset.
[00:11:47.313 --> 00:11:48.313]  It's horrifying.
[00:11:48.313 --> 00:11:51.313]   Or you're sitting there watching TV and suddenly you hear someone trying to break into your
[00:11:51.313 --> 00:11:52.313]  garage.
[00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:53.313]  That happened once to me.
[00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.313]  Never a peeping Tom.
[00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:57.193]  And that's why people are so upset.
[00:11:57.193 --> 00:12:03.492]   That's why they're angry is because it's like having somebody up against your window looking
[00:12:03.492 --> 00:12:07.793]   at you versus looking at you from a quarter or half mile away.
[00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:10.408]  And the Pentagon is exacerbating this.
[00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:14.371]  You know, it does turn out that a bunch of these balloons came over when Trump was in office.
[00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:21.716]  And General Milley, the traitor, the globalist, the critical race theory pusher, and others decided not to tell him.
[00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.998]  Well, that's a felony when it's their job to tell him he didn't.
[00:12:25.418 --> 00:12:28.701]  But they didn't want Trump to look good telling China not to do it or shooting him down.
[00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:33.341]  Instead, they just continued it, but now they want to embarrass Biden.
[00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:35.302]  He's supposed to not run again.
[00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:38.785]  He's supposed to go away, so they're bringing out the Hunter Biden laptop after the election.
[00:12:38.805 --> 00:12:44.389]  They're bringing out all the other corruption issues, the fact that he has dementia, and that he didn't shoot the balloon down.
[00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:50.214]  He finally woke up before they could really set him up, because they want him gone, and shot one down.
[00:12:50.274 --> 00:12:54.958]  And now he thinks he's the president, so he ordered him, you will be court-martialed.
[00:12:55.378 --> 00:12:58.861]  I'll have you removed if you don't shoot that next one down.
[00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:06.903]  So now they've got all the fighter planes right there where they come in over the North Pole, over Alaska, into Canada on a flight path.
[00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:13.708]  They could come in right over the North Pole and come right down over Minnesota, or come right in over Michigan, or come right in over Maine.
[00:13:13.948 --> 00:13:16.210]  But no, they want to do a whole flight path across the U.S.
[00:13:16.551 --> 00:13:23.977]  So they come in, they launch them over the North Pole, and they come on down on the western side, come right down Alaska, right down across the middle of the United States.
[00:13:24.017 --> 00:13:26.779]  And that's the answer, and that's what it is, with a nice bow on it.
[00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.960]  I don't think anybody can disagree with me.
[00:13:28.988 --> 00:13:30.369]  Now what can these big balloons do?
[00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:35.530]  The media keeps saying the big one they shot down last week was as long as three school buses.
[00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.891]  No, it was much bigger than that.
[00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:38.672]  That's what was hanging off the bottom.
[00:13:38.772 --> 00:13:40.532]  It was gigantic.
[00:13:41.313 --> 00:13:42.253]  And I can tell you, the U.S.
[00:13:42.293 --> 00:13:44.354]  has stuff even bigger, which they've admitted to.
[00:13:45.322 --> 00:13:46.002]  They're blimps.
[00:13:47.063 --> 00:13:58.528]  And so this thing would be the perfect thing to, again, ground scanning, reading radar to get real topography lists, but also to carry an EMP bomb or something else.
[00:13:58.548 --> 00:14:03.031]  And that's why it is a serious situation when Biden tried to spin it at first and said it was no big deal.
[00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:07.613]  Then he saw the poll numbers, or his people did, and said this is a little too far.
[00:14:07.693 --> 00:14:12.015]  So that's what's scary about Biden is he has very few loyal people around him.
[00:14:12.715 --> 00:14:13.696]  They all work for Obama.
[00:14:14.994 --> 00:14:19.016]  And now they're going to continue to set him up, to make him step down, which makes the U.S.
[00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:20.237]  look even weaker to the world.
[00:14:21.717 --> 00:14:41.267]  An even bigger joke, as the deep state plays politics with the puppet they protected, that they censored for, they surveilled for, that they harassed people for, that they imprisoned people for, and then they put him in, and now they want to get rid of him, and now they cause this incredibly dangerous destabilization move, while we're basically at war with Russia.
[00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:43.448]  So, that's the news on the blimp.
[00:14:44.505 --> 00:14:52.261]  I'm going to come back and hit massive news on euthanasia being pushed not just in Canada but around the world and so much more.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]  more, please stay with us.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.120]  [Music]
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.120]  [Music]
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.120]  The world is being taken into a transition.
[00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:29.542]  Honest to transhumanist transition.
[00:15:30.862 --> 00:15:45.515]  The end of all life forms as we know it and the rise of a scientifically directed forced evolutionary system beyond terraforming just the atmosphere, but terraforming the very genetics of the planet itself.
[00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:54.463]  Welcome to the scientific dictatorship that is the New World Order and its program of the Great Reset to build back better on our ashes.
[00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:57.844]  That's where I wanted to go with this.
[00:15:57.844 --> 00:16:06.844]   It took an episode, an epic four-hour episode, the biggest podcast Joe Rogan ever did.
[00:16:07.287 --> 00:16:12.752]  It's now officially eclipsed the former biggest one, Elon Musk, his first interview with him.
[00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:15.715]  My second podcast with Rogan, like, four years ago.
[00:16:15.735 --> 00:16:21.640]  I didn't want him as a guest many times, but on other shows he was doing many times, but not his official podcast.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:31.771]   The second time I was on there, and he asked about aliens, and I explained to him that That these laboratories, both government and private, are making aliens.
[00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:38.836]  Not just mixing plants and animals and fish with insects and just thousands of different chimeras.
[00:16:39.737 --> 00:16:41.818]  Humanized mice, they had 30 years ago.
[00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:42.719]  The list goes on and on.
[00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:46.362]  They told you Dolly the sheep was the first clone back in the early 90s.
[00:16:46.402 --> 00:16:47.243]  That was a big lie.
[00:16:48.484 --> 00:16:50.085]  In fact, that was easily verified as a lie.
[00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:53.147]  It was in the mainline literature that the Nazis were cloning rabbits.
[00:16:54.408 --> 00:16:57.571]  So, examples of this go on and on.
[00:16:58.544 --> 00:17:02.005]  And I said, so they're making alien life forms here in the lab.
[00:17:03.285 --> 00:17:07.607]  And it was shortly after that even MIT had headlines about alien life forms are being made.
[00:17:08.267 --> 00:17:16.249]  And if you look at some of the synthetic nanotech viruses they're making, they have no origin in a natural virus.
[00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:32.213]   They're completely made In laboratories using different chemicals and different complex compounds, use the building blocks of life but don't use any of the actual main parts of it, that are completely new and alien to the planet.
[00:17:32.513 --> 00:17:39.196]  So alien simply means not of this world, not of the natural line of this world.
[00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:42.238]  They can make new creatures.
[00:17:43.218 --> 00:17:54.604]   And so I explained that That was one form of alien, and that if they create an artificial AI that thinks it's conscious, whether it's conscious or not, that's a new, quote, life form on this planet.
[00:17:54.704 --> 00:18:05.828]  And then inter-dimensionally, people take DMT and other drugs, you can have 30 people together, they do these ceremonies, and the government's done these tests where, in many cases, they will all see the same entities at the same time.
[00:18:06.428 --> 00:18:13.031]  So you're not having your own individual hallucination, it's lifting the veil that the Bible talks about, people are actually seeing other dimensions.
[00:18:14.503 --> 00:18:18.446]  And it could be transmissions, recordings of different times, fold space.
[00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:23.809]  There's a lot of different mathematical theories that predicted this over 130 years ago that they're now manifesting.
[00:18:25.674 --> 00:18:31.956]  But they took like a 30-minute rant from that four-hour show and edited it down to a minute and a half, and it's got millions and millions of views.
[00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:32.656]  It's all over the place.
[00:18:33.076 --> 00:18:34.296]  It just broke last night.
[00:18:34.737 --> 00:18:36.737]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:18:37.177 --> 00:18:41.979]  Elon Musk retweets hilarious video of Alex Jones and Joe Rogan discussing space aliens.
[00:18:42.399 --> 00:18:46.460]  And what's funny is people are watching this video on Twitter, and Elon Musk retweeted it.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.321]  And they think it's not edited.
[00:18:48.381 --> 00:18:56.689]  They think this is really going on when it's a mash-up to basically turn the very serious topic I was talking about into a joke.
[00:18:56.709 --> 00:18:57.089]  Here it is.
[00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.332]  Where do you think the contact with the aliens came from?
[00:19:00.893 --> 00:19:01.873]  When did that start?
[00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.996]  You know, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:19:05.217 --> 00:19:06.338]  I need to hear about aliens.
[00:19:06.498 --> 00:19:07.418]  I know you already know all this, Joe.
[00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:08.840]  Hold on a second.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.142]  But I want to ask you this because I don't know.
[00:19:11.682 --> 00:19:12.163]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:19:12.243 --> 00:19:13.504]  We're in contact with aliens.
[00:19:13.724 --> 00:19:14.644]  Like what kind of sh**?
[00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:15.225]  Here's what's happening.
[00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.705]  Because it's not just one group of aliens.
[00:19:16.965 --> 00:19:17.946]  What's the different groups?
[00:19:18.226 --> 00:19:18.906]  The big five.
[00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:20.126]  Okay, tell me what's going on.
[00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:20.666]  Let me begin.
[00:19:20.686 --> 00:19:23.247]  This is really, I'm telling you Joe, this is a real deal.
[00:19:23.327 --> 00:19:24.008]  We're listening to you.
[00:19:24.148 --> 00:19:26.108]  Well first off, elves is the main group.
[00:19:26.468 --> 00:19:26.588]  Okay.
[00:19:26.628 --> 00:19:27.569]  And they call them the elves.
[00:19:27.589 --> 00:19:28.289]  It's the Clockwork Elves.
[00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:29.509]  I don't think you're allowed to say that anymore.
[00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.391]  There are bad things that look like elves that have horns when they show you who they really are.
[00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:33.851]  Damn.
[00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:34.751]  They're bad aliens.
[00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:35.572]  I'm with you.
[00:19:35.852 --> 00:19:36.792]  AI is alien.
[00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:38.393]  They're like a robot.
[00:19:38.493 --> 00:19:40.054]  Yeah, they're like robots coming to kill you.
[00:19:40.175 --> 00:19:40.875]  Jesus Christ.
[00:19:41.155 --> 00:19:42.596]  The chimeras are alien.
[00:19:42.697 --> 00:19:47.220]  And there's a hive mind sort of thinking to a lot of it.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.661]  They want the organs.
[00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:50.122]  I swear on my kids I told you the truth about that.
[00:19:50.182 --> 00:19:50.683]  I believe you.
[00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:51.583]  I believe you.
[00:19:51.603 --> 00:19:53.004]  They're coming after everybody.
[00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:53.525]  Jesus.
[00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.146]  It's a breakaway civilization, dude.
[00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:56.247]  We don't know what they've got.
[00:19:56.327 --> 00:19:57.528]  Joe, they're control freaks.
[00:19:57.808 --> 00:19:58.689]  Everybody's a control freak.
[00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:00.290]  That's why I'm so glad you're in the fight now.
[00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.872]  These guys are on stuff that nobody even knows.
[00:20:03.092 --> 00:20:03.833]  What do you think they're on?
[00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:05.773]  Stuff they've been given.
[00:20:05.853 --> 00:20:06.114]  Okay.
[00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:07.455]  I understand what you're saying.
[00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:09.158]  You know, there's like armed guys with machine guns.
[00:20:09.238 --> 00:20:12.482]  That is a group of people that were obsessed with combat.
[00:20:12.642 --> 00:20:14.504]  About the most fearless killers there are.
[00:20:14.524 --> 00:20:16.307]  You think that's from their heritage of war?
[00:20:16.327 --> 00:20:18.289]  I mean, it's just like, it's a mental illness, man.
[00:20:18.389 --> 00:20:18.570]  Yep.
[00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:19.931]  That's a fact.
[00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:23.156]  Now, one of the other types of...
[00:20:25.504 --> 00:21:02.848]   Aliens that the Globalist openly in their white papers talk about and Elon Musk says beware of AI gods is what Google when it first got CIA funding in 1998 was officially founded in 99 with Schmidt and the rest of them, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, in their original prospectus to investors, in Q-Tel and the CIA, look it up, They said, we want to create a live time system with billions of nodes, then trillions of nodes in all the devices everywhere, and then get humans to wear headsets and interface with it, so that the hive mind of humans will be interfaced with that.
[00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:14.753]  And we will then declare that this merger of humans in live time, giving data and information to the supercomputer will be a super brain, or a group collective consciousness.
[00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:32.198]   And if you have billions of people at one time logged into Google, Talking to Google, AI scanning it, chatbots, all these systems integrated together, recording everything you're doing, using you as a sensor, using the billions of cameras and ring systems as sensors.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.581]  They are calling that because it's interfacing with billions of intelligences and with conscious beings.
[00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:55.665]  That interface, they say they believe, would be the first true AI that really would be conscious, but only because it's jacked in to not just billions of neurons like you have in your brain, but each one of us as a neuron in that group collective brain.
[00:21:56.366 --> 00:21:57.406]  And that's what I told Job.
[00:21:58.226 --> 00:21:59.968]  But you notice the editor of that piece, Joe, didn't.
[00:22:00.848 --> 00:22:02.410]  Some interesting group on the internet.
[00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.191]  I don't even know who they are.
[00:22:03.651 --> 00:22:04.812]  So many great artists out there.
[00:22:04.852 --> 00:22:05.333]  But they did it.
[00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:06.574]  They're going to ridicule me at the end.
[00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:08.415]  And oh, it's mental illness.
[00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:11.168]  And then Joe goes, absolutely it is.
[00:22:11.628 --> 00:22:14.931]  And that's why Elon put it out there as kind of a backslap.
[00:22:15.472 --> 00:22:30.465]  But meanwhile, when Elon went on Joe's show about a month after I was on that time, he agreed that it's interdimensional and that there's multidimensions in the dark matter that's at least five times more magnetically strong and is bleeding into ours and that there basically are people interfacing with this.
[00:22:31.502 --> 00:22:34.784]  And so when I tell you all this, this is what the establishment believes.
[00:22:34.824 --> 00:22:35.845]  This is what they're studying.
[00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:36.846]  This is what they're doing.
[00:22:37.626 --> 00:22:44.351]  And we've talked about it ad nauseum, but I just thought that was very, very interesting that now this is all coming out.
[00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:59.069]   They kind of used an edited video of myself to create more energy in the background chatter and ambient noise that we're having aliens invade right now when they're really just Balloons and blimps.
[00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:01.050]  So I've hit that now.
[00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.933]  I said I'd get into the euthanasia and dehumanization that ties directly into this.
[00:23:05.353 --> 00:23:07.895]  I will do that when we come back.
[00:23:08.588 --> 00:23:12.828]   and then the next layer of censorship and some of the incredible stuff that happened in
[00:23:12.828 --> 00:23:18.668]   this week's hearings where the illegal government surveillance and spying on people came out.
[00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:25.147]   Very, very powerful information. And we have the latest on moves worldwide by Pfizer and Moderna
[00:23:25.147 --> 00:23:29.788]   to make governments bring back forced injections. It's happening in Brazil and other areas. We're
[00:23:29.788 --> 00:23:37.388]   going to hit that. We've got a lot of information on the economy and more tonight.
[00:23:37.492 --> 00:23:39.092]  Hillary wants to take your cash away.
[00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:45.951]  and full words.com. Stay with us.
[00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:52.951]  Live, raw and uncensored.
[00:23:53.615 --> 00:23:57.756]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:23:58.516 --> 00:23:59.996]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:24:02.782 --> 00:24:07.085]  Man, I can't even keep track of all the great fans out there making videos that are going viral.
[00:24:07.686 --> 00:24:10.548]  Here's one that's already got millions of views that I just saw on Friday.
[00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:13.190]  It's hilarious, especially if you're a TV viewer.
[00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.970]  Here it is.
[00:24:15.691 --> 00:24:19.935]  Everybody we have on is fighting with everything they've got!
[00:24:20.155 --> 00:24:23.957]  This is a war against you and your family of inflation and collapse!
[00:24:24.298 --> 00:24:27.220]  So when you keep us in the fight, you keep yourself in the fight!
[00:24:28.752 --> 00:24:31.133]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get amazing products.

[00:24:33.253 --> 00:24:37.115]  Make a donation at the top because he's a gladiator and a champion in the fight.
[00:24:37.315 --> 00:24:39.515]  And if you don't support us, you're helping the enemy.
[00:24:39.675 --> 00:24:40.896]  And I'm not bitching at listeners.
[00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:43.136]  I'm telling you, this is all out war!
[00:24:44.057 --> 00:24:44.377]  Yay.
[00:24:44.597 --> 00:24:46.177]  Thank you so much for coming to Austin.
[00:24:46.978 --> 00:24:47.338]  Thank you.
[00:24:47.378 --> 00:24:48.098]  Thank you for having me.
[00:24:49.578 --> 00:24:53.319]  That is some really super HD stuff right there.
[00:24:53.379 --> 00:24:54.840]  Great job to the folks that made that.
[00:24:57.904 --> 00:24:59.945]  By the way, our supplements really are the best.
[00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:01.006]  It's how we stay on air.
[00:25:01.987 --> 00:25:11.093]  It is not a gimmick that I'm over a week late in launching the new specials, but I have been so busy with other issues that we have not launched new specials.
[00:25:12.234 --> 00:25:20.460]  And that means good deals for you because I was going to take most of these products off sale because it's months and months till more come in and then sell them at 25% off or 10% off instead of 50% off.
[00:25:25.174 --> 00:25:31.598]  But I haven't gotten in the meetings and looked at what we have and some of the new stuff that's coming in, and so we're just keeping the sale going.
[00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:38.163]  But I've got to end the sale tomorrow, but I haven't done it in over a week, so who knows if I will.
[00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:40.444]  It keeps us on air, plus you get a great deal.
[00:25:40.524 --> 00:25:42.786]  I would take advantage of this now because it's got to end at some point.
[00:25:43.206 --> 00:25:47.729]  In fact, some of these things have been pulled off because they have basically sold out.
[00:25:47.749 --> 00:25:49.531]  Well, not basically, they have.

[00:27:03.673 --> 00:27:09.694]  I want to thank you all for your continued support.
[00:27:10.374 --> 00:27:10.734]  Okay.
[00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:14.455]  Let's talk about why they're doing all this.
[00:27:14.495 --> 00:27:15.595]  And I know the listeners know this.
[00:27:15.615 --> 00:27:16.896]  We have new listeners all the time tuning in.
[00:27:16.916 --> 00:27:18.076]  So I want to cover why they're doing it.
[00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:19.836]  Because we're here to warn new people.
[00:27:19.856 --> 00:27:21.096]  That's the most important mission, remember.
[00:27:21.736 --> 00:27:23.757]  And then we'll hit all the new news that's unfolding.
[00:27:24.477 --> 00:27:42.627]   All of the destabilization of society and the liquidation of borders, the evaluation of currencies, the attack on family, all of this in the words of Paul Ehrlich, who is the grand pooh boy still alive of the modern eugenics movement that Bill Gates says is his guru, is to destroy families to make them untenable to reduce population.
[00:27:43.848 --> 00:27:46.570]  And to make those that are left easily controllable.
[00:27:48.152 --> 00:27:54.236]  And of course to make you not stand up for others so they won't stand up for you and so you won't even stand up for yourself.
[00:27:55.838 --> 00:27:59.461]  Before I hit this news, here's the example or the analogy.
[00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:10.774]  If you walk out in your front yard in the morning and are getting in the car to go to work and you smell really powerful gas, you're going to run around your house and check your gas meter and check out what's coming from there.
[00:28:11.295 --> 00:28:12.355]  You're going to follow the smell.
[00:28:12.375 --> 00:28:16.557]  This has happened to me, it's probably happened to a lot of you, to your neighbor's house.
[00:28:17.757 --> 00:28:25.241]  And nobody's there, but you can hear the leak coming out of the ground, the case I saw, right by the meter.
[00:28:26.158 --> 00:28:28.559]  And it's really strong, and that's a big danger.
[00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:34.841]  If somebody can start their car or anything and it can blow up, not just their house, but your house, you see these gas explosions.
[00:28:35.182 --> 00:28:38.923]  What happens every couple days in the U.S., sometimes the family's home and everybody dies.
[00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:42.024]  So, that's going on.
[00:28:43.165 --> 00:28:46.626]  And you go knock on your neighbor's door, and Bob's not there.
[00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:56.370]   Well, you got Bob's number, you go in the house and check by the refrigerator where you got the neighbor's numbers written down, and you call him at work and you say, You got a big gas leak.
[00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.311]  Okay, great.
[00:28:57.891 --> 00:28:58.111]  Great.
[00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:00.832]  I'm gonna come home and fix it, or I'm gonna come home and call the city right now.
[00:29:00.912 --> 00:29:01.332]  Thank you.
[00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:05.974]  Now that's... you're not a hero because you did that.
[00:29:08.554 --> 00:29:12.696]  I've got a little pool at my house, and about six months ago, the lawn care guys...
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.161]  Come to the door.
[00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:15.841]  I'm already at work.
[00:29:16.361 --> 00:29:17.802]  Tell my wife, hey, you got a gas leak right here.
[00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:19.483]  She calls the pool company.
[00:29:19.903 --> 00:29:20.403]  They get out there.
[00:29:20.423 --> 00:29:21.904]  They go, boy, it's a good thing we got here.
[00:29:21.964 --> 00:29:27.766]  This pipe on your old heater, it's an old system, I got a new heater, had rotted through and gas was just shooting out.
[00:29:29.527 --> 00:29:35.170]  And if somebody would have tripped the heater on it for the hot tub or the pool, it could have blown the house up.
[00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.291]  That just happened five, six months ago.
[00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:39.675]  We had to pay for a new heater and all that crap.
[00:29:40.035 --> 00:29:49.339]  But what I'm getting at here is, it's not heroic that the yard guys came to the door, mowing the yard, the lawn company, and said, hey, you got a gas leak out here.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.482]  Now, you see video out of China where somebody gets hit by a car on a busy street and nobody helps them.
[00:29:56.143 --> 00:30:01.605]  And other authoritarian countries, because you learn that nobody stands up for you, why should you stand up for them?
[00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:05.067]  And that's what you have in authoritarian societies, is people not helping each other.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.081]  It's the same thing with these poison shots.
[00:30:08.602 --> 00:30:15.727]  We know they're killing people, we know they don't protect you, we know it's by design, and they're testing to see if they can just normalize this.
[00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:17.068]  Well, what about the children?
[00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:27.195]  Because we can laugh at libtards all day and say, go get your fifth booster, go ahead and die, you're winning the Darwin Award, go ahead and extinct yourself, but the children don't deserve it.
[00:30:27.275 --> 00:30:30.698]  Plus, do you want to live in a society where nobody cares about each other?
[00:30:30.718 --> 00:30:44.330]   It'd be like if you saw your neighbor's house, You drive home from a pool game or whatever, or a poker game at midnight, and you see suspicious people that aren't your neighbors loading your neighbor's stuff into a van at midnight, you call the police!
[00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:49.551]  Because you want to be treated like... you want to be treated.
[00:30:49.671 --> 00:30:55.093]  You treat your neighbors, do unto others as you have them do unto you, and that's what you do.
[00:30:57.373 --> 00:31:01.374]  And that's why if you see a cop, you're driving down the highway, and they're radar gunning, you can't help it.
[00:31:02.281 --> 00:31:05.682]  You go ahead and flip your lights on to let people know, hey, better slow down.
[00:31:07.222 --> 00:31:14.404]  That's the spirit we need to heighten and intensify of working together as a civilization.
[00:31:16.145 --> 00:31:20.586]  And if we don't do that, we'll all be isolated and destroyed and controlled.
[00:31:20.606 --> 00:31:31.609]  And I have a big stack of news here that is so bombshell I'll cover next segment with the latest on the poison shots and then governments around the world making it mandatory.
[00:31:32.961 --> 00:31:34.061]  They're not backing off this thing.
[00:31:34.081 --> 00:31:35.421]  That's why we've got to keep pushing and fighting.
[00:31:35.701 --> 00:31:44.303]  This is their takeover of our bodies and the surveillance to make sure we've taken all the shots is the excuse for the total control in the Cancel Society.
[00:31:44.523 --> 00:31:46.683]  And I have Hillary admitting it in a video as well.
[00:31:46.883 --> 00:31:48.984]  A new video that's on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:50.644 --> 00:31:51.504]  So I've set the table.
[00:31:51.604 --> 00:31:56.105]  Now let's start getting into some of the headlines that are just today's news with examples of this.
[00:31:57.525 --> 00:32:04.781]   America is racing towards Canada's euthanasia free-for-all as seven more states I legalizing assisted suicide.
[00:32:04.801 --> 00:32:06.382]  That's probably government pushed.
[00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:12.005]  Deadly doses as prescribed for anorexics and more.
[00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:15.647]  Nurses are inking prescriptions.
[00:32:17.244 --> 00:32:20.726]  So they're just making it like you're going to get a hamburger to give you pills that'll kill you.
[00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:24.027]  They're making it so easy just to normalize this is going on.
[00:32:24.428 --> 00:32:27.649]  Germany pressures Twitter to commit censorship.
[00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:30.030]  How are they going to suppress this while they do this?
[00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.131]  That ties into this stack.
[00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:34.973]  Yale professors suggest mass suicide for old people in Japan.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.702]  And it goes on and on with the crime exploding and some examples of that.
[00:32:42.342 --> 00:33:02.995]   And the Democrats are deep staters, or the opposite of not caring about their neighbors, they've gone to the more extreme, that's how it works, the slippery slope of wanting to kill their neighbors, and an idea of wanting to hurt your fellow man gets you ahead, when in the historical examples That never works and completely backfires.
[00:33:03.035 --> 00:33:11.421]  Yes, Switzerland, suicide pods provide a painless death with VR right out of Soylent Green.
[00:33:12.802 --> 00:33:21.308]  It's all coming up today on this live Sunday, February 12th, 2023 transmission and so much more.
[00:33:21.668 --> 00:33:26.972]  Have you shared the links to man.video and InfoWars.com or ConspiracyFact.info?
[00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:28.231]  Are you fighting back?
[00:33:28.231 --> 00:33:38.231]  [MUSIC]
[00:33:38.231 --> 00:33:48.231]  [MUSIC]
[00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:58.231]  [MUSIC]
[00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:08.231]  Yeah.
[00:34:08.231 --> 00:34:10.231]  [MUSIC]
[00:34:10.601 --> 00:34:11.781]  You're an adult.
[00:34:12.102 --> 00:34:13.062]  You're taking heroin.
[00:34:13.082 --> 00:34:14.343]  You're drinking bottles of whiskey.
[00:34:14.363 --> 00:34:15.763]  You're hurting yourself.
[00:34:16.524 --> 00:34:17.264]  But you're an adult.
[00:34:17.304 --> 00:34:18.145]  You want to kill yourself.
[00:34:18.205 --> 00:34:19.165]  That's your right to do it.
[00:34:20.986 --> 00:34:22.087]  But what about the children?
[00:34:22.107 --> 00:34:23.948]  You see, they can't abort them before they're born.
[00:34:24.788 --> 00:34:28.230]  They want to transgender them and cut their genitals off and their breasts off later.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.761]  This is the control they want.
[00:34:32.101 --> 00:34:34.702]  And let's, before we look at the crime exploding, look at some of these headlines.
[00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:35.942]  It begins!
[00:34:37.203 --> 00:34:38.083]  We've got the video.
[00:34:38.183 --> 00:34:53.309]  Brazilian Socialist President Lula da Silva forces poor families to vaccinate their children so they can receive financial aid from his regime or risk receiving nothing and the country's going full communist so you don't have a choice.
[00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.030]  Big report on that from TheGatewayPundit.com.
[00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.651]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:00.472 --> 00:35:03.473]  And there is Lula on TV saying it right out there in the open.
[00:35:03.493 --> 00:35:08.113]  And it's Pfizer coming in that has a deal with him to do this.
[00:35:08.954 --> 00:35:10.354]  Depopulating his own people.
[00:35:11.454 --> 00:35:13.074]  But Bernie Sanders is going to save us.
[00:35:13.274 --> 00:35:15.035]  Bernie Sanders has a new role.
[00:35:15.055 --> 00:35:17.275]  It could be his final act in Washington.
[00:35:17.895 --> 00:35:23.516]  He's going to call in the heads of Big Pharma that made millions, pop the shots, and ask why they made profits.
[00:35:23.556 --> 00:35:25.757]  He's defending the shots, saying they're good.
[00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:35.315]  He's making the issue about how the fact that they're getting filthy rich and have made over $100 billion between the four companies together, most of it Pfizer.
[00:35:36.996 --> 00:35:38.277]  Now let's start playing these clips.
[00:35:38.317 --> 00:35:40.218]  This is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:35:40.658 --> 00:35:41.439]  This is all confirmed.
[00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:42.519]  I told you this three years ago.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.761]  Dr. Peter McCullough has confirmed it now.
[00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:47.043]  The documents are all there in the Twitter files.
[00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:50.465]  That's just one area that we can find him, but because of Musk, we know about it.
[00:35:51.769 --> 00:35:55.992]  He says the vaccine is a Pentagon project, says Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which is a fact.
[00:35:56.653 --> 00:36:01.036]  Then they farmed it out to Gates and others to then release the virus and roll the entire attack out.
[00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:03.257]  Now that's not our average military men and women.
[00:36:03.537 --> 00:36:08.821]  That is the New World Order that sees humans as the threat.
[00:36:09.702 --> 00:36:10.883]  Here is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:36:12.231 --> 00:36:17.871]   138 companies that were involved in manufacturing and distributing the vaccine,
[00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:19.431]  they're all military contractors.
[00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:25.431]   The Pentagon and the National Security Agency ran the entire pandemic response.
[00:36:25.431 --> 00:36:29.090]  Pfizer and Moderna don't really own those vaccines.
[00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:34.512]   They slapped their labels on them, but it was a Pentagon project.
[00:36:40.271 --> 00:36:42.632]  All right, let's go to the next clip.
[00:36:42.632 --> 00:36:44.911]  Let's go to clip 13, crew.
[00:36:45.441 --> 00:36:50.084]  This is Josh Sterling, highly respected insurance analyst at a state hearing.
[00:36:51.693 --> 00:36:59.575]  With Edward Dowd, the people who are under the age of 50 who took the vaccine now are 49% higher mortality rate.
[00:37:00.255 --> 00:37:01.416]  One dose increases it 145%.
[00:37:02.016 --> 00:37:05.277]  That's because if it's going to kill you, it usually kills you the first one.
[00:37:05.797 --> 00:37:10.298]  But it continues to increase up to several hundred percentage points if you take four or more of the shots.
[00:37:10.718 --> 00:37:14.019]  And these numbers are mirrored from Australia to Germany to the U.S.
[00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:15.720]  Here is Josh Sterling.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.766]  The senator asked us to show just the one chart that tells the entire story.
[00:37:21.246 --> 00:37:22.168]  This is that chart.
[00:37:23.529 --> 00:37:34.524]  The UK government, until this summer, was reporting a data series that showed the relative mortality rates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated by the number of doses of the vaccine.
[00:37:35.669 --> 00:37:48.099]  We've done what we think is really professional work with this, and we think it simplifies down to a conclusion that says that through the last available data set, the people in the UK who took the vaccine have a 26% higher mortality rate.
[00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:55.504]  The people who are under the age of 50 who took the vaccine now have a 49% higher mortality rate.
[00:37:56.245 --> 00:38:05.598]   And worst of all, The people who only took one dose of the vaccine have approximately 145% worse mortality rate.
[00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:28.712]   That last data point is on its face confusing, especially because it seems like there's more and more, you know, it just doesn't make a ton of sense, unless you realize That what's going on with this, really, is that the people who took the dose, the first dose, in the United States, that's about 12% of people, but then stopped taking any other doses.
[00:38:29.252 --> 00:38:34.199]   Those people, through their choice to stop, Disproportionately the ones who are harmed.
[00:38:35.019 --> 00:38:55.487]  And so what we're concluding is that if you happen to be an unlucky person who was in some fashion even moderately injured, with a minor injury and decided not to continue, the statistics, the best statistics we have, show that you're going to have, at least through today, maybe it'll get better, you know, and obviously we're all here because we're hoping to find treatments and cures and screening and interventions.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.123]  You know, but if that doesn't happen, we have to assume that this is now the baseline, there's going to be 145% higher mortality.
[00:39:02.203 --> 00:39:12.967]  And if you were to take these numbers and just apply them to the United States, that ends up being something like 600,000 excess deaths per year in the United States from this higher vaccine-induced mortality.
[00:39:13.448 --> 00:39:20.611]  And, you know, that's obviously a really concerning thing, and I'm happy you called the meeting, and I know we're all hoping to get to answers.
[00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:21.171]  Thank you.
[00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:33.550]  And again, I thought that statistic on a single dose was pretty interesting because, let's face it, just about everybody knows somebody who took the first dose and had a severe reaction, they're not going to take the second one.
[00:39:35.283 --> 00:39:38.264]  That's a federal hearing with Senator Johnson.
[00:39:38.844 --> 00:39:40.684]  I also have state hearings here.
[00:39:41.344 --> 00:39:42.484]  This is another federal hearing.
[00:39:43.104 --> 00:39:57.807]  This is Representative Nancy Mace ripping into the Twitter executives that suppressed her getting medical knowledge and the former Twitter executives about blocking COVID information directly by Big Pharma and the federal government Democratic Party.
[00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:01.348]  Blocking from day one, knowing what they were doing, premeditated.
[00:40:01.408 --> 00:40:03.768]  Now listen what it's done to this woman.
[00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.429]  consequences for this type of online harassment and speech.
[00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:12.789]  Oh that's... I must say those are very real consequences.
[00:40:12.789 --> 00:40:14.230]  Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[00:40:14.258 --> 00:40:16.920]  The Twitter files were not just about Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.624]  Twitter worked overtime to suppress accurate COVID information.
[00:40:21.024 --> 00:40:25.088]  Apparently, the views of a Stanford doctor are disinformation to you people.
[00:40:25.669 --> 00:40:28.371]  I, along with many Americans, have long-term effects from COVID.
[00:40:28.411 --> 00:40:31.394]  Not only was I a long hauler, but I have effects from the vaccine.
[00:40:31.414 --> 00:40:37.940]  It wasn't the first shot, but it was the second shot that I now developed asthma that has never gone away since I had the second shot.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:45.447]  I have tremors in my left hand and I have the occasional heart pain that no doctor can explain and I've had a battery of tests.
[00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:52.453]  I have great regrets about getting this shot because of the health issues that I now have that I don't think are ever going to go away.
[00:40:52.813 --> 00:40:54.074]  Where did you go to medical school?
[00:40:54.295 --> 00:40:55.296]  I did not go to medical school.
[00:40:55.476 --> 00:40:55.876]  I'm sorry?
[00:40:56.236 --> 00:40:57.217]  I did not go to medical school.
[00:40:57.237 --> 00:40:57.738]  That's what I thought.
[00:40:59.295 --> 00:41:05.300]  Why do you think you or anyone else at Twitter have the medical expertise to censor a doctor's expert opinion?
[00:41:06.261 --> 00:41:10.966]  Our policies regarding COVID were designed to protect individuals.
[00:41:11.046 --> 00:41:21.155]  We were seeing... You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors, Stanford-educated doctors, doctors that are educated in the best places in the world, and you silenced those voices.
[00:41:22.156 --> 00:41:23.337]  You're not a doctor, right, Miss Gatti?
[00:41:25.026 --> 00:41:25.426]  No, I'm not.
[00:41:25.606 --> 00:41:25.906]  Okay.
[00:41:26.006 --> 00:41:32.609]  What makes you think you or anyone else at Twitter have the medical expertise to censor actual, accurate CDC data?
[00:41:33.669 --> 00:41:35.750]  I'm not familiar with these particular situations.
[00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:36.510]  Yeah, I'm sure you're not.
[00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.771]  It's not just about the laptop.
[00:41:37.811 --> 00:41:45.813]  This is about medical advice that expert doctors were trying to give Americans because social media companies like Twitter were silencing their voices.
[00:41:46.354 --> 00:41:46.914]  Did the U.S.
[00:41:46.954 --> 00:41:52.996]  government ever contact you or anyone at Twitter to pressure Twitter to moderate or censor certain tweets?
[00:41:55.219 --> 00:41:55.799]  Yes or no?
[00:41:58.341 --> 00:42:00.522]  We have a program.
[00:42:00.562 --> 00:42:01.502]  Did the U.S.
[00:42:01.542 --> 00:42:07.085]  government ever contact you or anyone at Twitter to censor or moderate certain tweets?
[00:42:07.145 --> 00:42:07.925]  Yes or no?
[00:42:08.005 --> 00:42:11.807]  We received legal demands to remove content from the platform from the U.S.
[00:42:11.827 --> 00:42:13.708]  government and governments all around the world.
[00:42:13.828 --> 00:42:15.069]  Thank God for Matt Taibbi.
[00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:21.032]  Thank God for Elon Musk for allowing to show us in the world that Twitter was basically a subsidiary of the FBI.
[00:42:22.924 --> 00:42:26.907]  All right, now, I'm going to play this next clip, and we played this a few years ago, but it's resurfaced.
[00:42:27.348 --> 00:42:30.511]  I'm only going to play 30 seconds of it, but this is not out of context.
[00:42:30.551 --> 00:42:33.213]  She goes on and on to say white people are bad, they won't take the shots.
[00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:36.175]  In fact, the higher educated you are, they won't take the shots.
[00:42:37.276 --> 00:42:40.199]  And she says we need to kill the white people, we need to get rid of the white people.
[00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:46.004]  Here is Carol Baker, who's an old white lady, the head CDC official in Texas at a Texas hearing.
[00:42:46.044 --> 00:42:46.384]  Here it is.
[00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:48.226]  The solution.
[00:42:49.275 --> 00:43:00.831]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers, I'm not talking about, well, hesitants, most of them we can talk into coming to terms, but refusers.
[00:43:02.293 --> 00:43:05.477]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[00:43:06.465 --> 00:43:11.547]  Because Houston is the most diverse city in the entire United States.
[00:43:11.887 --> 00:43:13.908]  There's seven Asian languages spoken.
[00:43:13.928 --> 00:43:16.188]  Alright, it's a sick clip.
[00:43:16.548 --> 00:43:19.589]  By the way, we have a ten minute compilation of the hearings.
[00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.270]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.752]  But the last segment of the show tonight, I'm going to air John Bowne's report.
[00:43:27.879 --> 00:43:30.562]  On this, that is extremely powerful.
[00:43:31.062 --> 00:43:32.604]  Our number two is coming up.
[00:43:33.104 --> 00:43:38.910]  The name of Jon Bowne's report that's on Banned.Video is the tyrannical Twitter clown show.
[00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.333]  I suggest you share that with everyone you know.
[00:43:42.992 --> 00:43:48.072]   but this is serious surveillance and information warfare to carry this out.
[00:43:48.072 --> 00:43:51.712]   And it's not going well with the new world order, but we haven't beaten them yet.
[00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:53.092]  So it's a life and death situation.
[00:43:53.092 --> 00:43:54.472]  We gotta save lives.
[00:43:54.472 --> 00:43:55.911]  I wanna thank our stations and affiliates.
[00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:57.472]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[00:43:57.472 --> 00:43:58.313]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:43:58.313 --> 00:44:01.992]   This is a lot more important than who wins the stupid Superbowl tonight.
[00:44:01.992 --> 00:44:03.711]  This is a life and death situation.
[00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:05.913]  It's an act of war they've carried out against us.
[00:44:05.913 --> 00:44:06.992]  Share the links now.
[00:44:06.992 --> 00:44:14.851]   If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors
[00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:16.152]  at the wellness company.
[00:44:16.138 --> 00:44:19.981]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[00:44:20.021 --> 00:44:24.404]  I contribute with, like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[00:44:24.544 --> 00:44:31.889]   Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement that features natokinase.
[00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:34.131]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[00:44:34.331 --> 00:44:39.994]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[00:44:40.034 --> 00:44:40.815]  This is very important.
[00:44:40.835 --> 00:44:45.657]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[00:44:45.857 --> 00:44:47.338]  People are low with the spike protein.
[00:44:47.358 --> 00:44:48.199]  They don't feel well.
[00:44:48.319 --> 00:44:49.940]  This is a potential solution.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.002]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[00:44:53.082 --> 00:44:55.863]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[00:44:56.003 --> 00:44:56.964]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:44:57.364 --> 00:45:03.229]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:07.952]  OnlineHealthNow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[00:45:07.972 --> 00:45:09.594]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[00:45:12.456 --> 00:45:13.837]  All right, we're into hour number two.
[00:45:13.857 --> 00:45:15.979]  The story just went live on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:18.801]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:24.772]  Breaking from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[00:45:25.493 --> 00:45:29.856]  It's Alex Jones breaking octagonal.
[00:45:29.876 --> 00:45:33.478]  I guess that's the same stop sign object shot down over Lake Huron.
[00:45:33.979 --> 00:45:35.880]  Fun in four words dot com breaking right now.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.463]  Members of Congress say we've been in contact with the D O D regarding it.
[00:45:40.784 --> 00:45:45.627]  Look, this is the U. S going to war with Russia and China ahead of the Russian offensive.
[00:45:45.647 --> 00:45:46.368]  It's not aliens.
[00:45:48.029 --> 00:45:49.390]  Very, very serious situation.
[00:45:50.598 --> 00:45:55.220]  And I've talked a lot about Nord Stream 2 and how all this other news has been distracting from that.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:02.063]  But Tucker Carlson did a great job on Friday night explaining what's really going on in the Nord Stream pipeline being blown up.
[00:46:02.463 --> 00:46:04.624]  An act of war against the population.
[00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:08.346]  And an act of war against Russia.
[00:46:08.626 --> 00:46:13.968]  And the fact that Biden would brag about it and then deny he'd done it is next level.
[00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:17.570]  So we're going to play this clip.
[00:46:18.803 --> 00:46:19.345]  And come back.
[00:46:19.987 --> 00:46:21.050]  This military shoots down.
[00:46:22.142 --> 00:46:24.684]  Octagonal flying object near Canadian border.
[00:46:25.265 --> 00:46:25.565]  Two U.S.
[00:46:25.625 --> 00:46:29.488]  officials speaking in condition of anonymity told Reuters the military had shot down the object.
[00:46:29.528 --> 00:46:30.970]  That's the biggest paper in Canada.
[00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:32.331]  That's the National Post.
[00:46:32.751 --> 00:46:34.412]  Story is also on Infowars.com.
[00:46:35.073 --> 00:46:38.015]  Please share the article and get it out to everyone you know.
[00:46:38.035 --> 00:46:39.096]  That's how we reach new people.
[00:46:39.116 --> 00:46:42.699]  Hey, Alex Jones is live on there right now covering another object shot down.
[00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:43.380]  People are like, ooh!
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.784]  They'll tune in and then they hear the truth and then we continue on in the information war.
[00:46:47.844 --> 00:46:48.885]  You are the key to this fight.
[00:46:49.525 --> 00:46:57.133]  On this live Sunday broadcast, when we came in to cover all this as it continues to accelerate, and Owen Troyer is coming up in about 55 minutes.
[00:46:57.393 --> 00:46:58.595]  Let's go to that Tucker Carlson report.
[00:46:59.315 --> 00:47:08.405]  So before the war in Ukraine even began, both Toria Nuland at the State Department, the number two at the State Department, and Joe Biden threatened to blow up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[00:47:08.886 --> 00:47:09.126]  Watch.
[00:47:10.308 --> 00:47:12.169]  I want to be clear with you today.
[00:47:12.929 --> 00:47:19.511]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[00:47:19.871 --> 00:47:28.713]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[00:47:29.033 --> 00:47:34.315]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[00:47:34.675 --> 00:47:35.795]  We will bring an end to it.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:47.883]  But how will you do that, exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?
[00:47:49.164 --> 00:47:51.865]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:55.773]  So then the pipelines actually blew up.
[00:47:55.873 --> 00:48:01.117]  These pipelines that bring natural gas from Eastern Europe to Western Europe to keep the European economy going.
[00:48:01.137 --> 00:48:07.722]  And they exploded, causing the single largest human-caused environmental disaster in all of history.
[00:48:08.222 --> 00:48:11.845]  And again, setting Europe on the road to actual poverty.
[00:48:12.924 --> 00:48:17.025]  So it was an unpopular event, and Joe Biden denied any responsibility.
[00:48:17.045 --> 00:48:18.465]  In fact, he blamed Russia.
[00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:28.328]  Joe Biden and his whole administration told us that somehow Russia, for reasons they never made clear just because they're evil, had sabotaged their own energy pipeline.
[00:48:28.528 --> 00:48:28.968]  Watch this.
[00:48:30.548 --> 00:48:37.690]  It was a deliberate act of sabotage, and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation and lies.
[00:48:39.133 --> 00:48:42.579]  So that was in September, and it was obvious from the very first day, well, that's not true.
[00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:47.808]  It's not that Vladimir Putin is too good a person to blow up Nord Stream, but like, why would he?
[00:48:48.009 --> 00:48:48.830]  It only hurts him.
[00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.056]  And by the way, it really hurts Western Europe.
[00:48:52.665 --> 00:48:59.391]  But a lot of media outlets repeated that lie dutifully, that's what they do, and attacked us as Putin stooges for having questions about it.
[00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:00.993]  Well, we know a lot more now.
[00:49:01.013 --> 00:49:07.158]  There have been a number of official investigations of what happened, and not one has found any evidence of Russian involvement.
[00:49:07.338 --> 00:49:09.320]  And now we have the actual answer to what happened.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.541]  Oh, the Biden administration did it.
[00:49:10.922 --> 00:49:11.282]  For real.
[00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:21.100]  Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, who's been around for more than 50 years, just wrote a piece on Substack that includes this, quote, Last June, the Navy divers, U.S.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:37.008]  Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized midsummer NATO exercise known as Ball Tops 22, planted remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning.
[00:49:37.028 --> 00:49:38.289]  Now, this piece continues.
[00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:41.751]  It's probably the most comprehensive news story you will read this year.
[00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:54.972]  Seymour Hersh on Substack, you should read it, and it recounts in detail meetings with the National Security Advisor at the White House, where this was planned, exactly what explosives were used, how they were triggered by what aircraft on what day.
[00:49:56.012 --> 00:50:00.033]  So many details in here that it is not possible that it's not true.
[00:50:00.253 --> 00:50:01.033]  It is true.
[00:50:02.073 --> 00:50:04.194]  And in fact, no one in the high level of the U.S.
[00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:07.975]  government is denying it with any specificity and said the White House is just dismissing it as utterly false.
[00:50:11.482 --> 00:50:13.625]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:50:14.146 --> 00:50:19.292]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:50:22.569 --> 00:50:24.390]  Well, we're into hour number two.
[00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:25.550]  Some major news just broke.
[00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.010]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:28.291]  It's also in the National Post.
[00:50:28.931 --> 00:50:30.912]  Also being picked up by CNN.
[00:50:31.972 --> 00:50:32.232]  U.S.
[00:50:32.252 --> 00:50:40.694]  shoots down octagonal, that's the same as a stop sign, flying object near Canadian border using F-16s.
[00:50:40.734 --> 00:50:41.395]  Here's what we know.
[00:50:41.895 --> 00:50:42.455]  A senior U.S.
[00:50:42.495 --> 00:50:45.236]  official said the object had an octagonal structure.
[00:50:46.016 --> 00:50:54.998]  With no discernible payload, a senior administration official said, on condition of anonymity, the United States has no indication the object posed a military threat or had surveillance capabilities.
[00:50:55.398 --> 00:51:00.519]  The object was recently detected over Montana, prompting the closure of U.S.
[00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:09.981]  airspace, the official said, but then it made its way all the way from there to the Michigan-Canadian border.
[00:51:10.441 --> 00:51:20.994]   This marks the fourth Unidentified flying object that has been destroyed near the North America of this month, flying over North America, straining U.S.
[00:51:21.014 --> 00:51:22.274]  relations with China.
[00:51:23.735 --> 00:51:25.855]  And it goes on from there.
[00:51:27.096 --> 00:51:28.156]  Here's the CNN headline.
[00:51:28.276 --> 00:51:30.237]  Object shot down near Lake Huron.
[00:51:30.617 --> 00:51:35.599]  Pentagon confirms F-16 fighter jet shot down an airborne object over Lake Huron.
[00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:39.360]  Canada confirmed that as well.
[00:51:40.444 --> 00:51:44.687]  Breaking octagon-shaped aircraft shot down over Lake Huron by U.S.
[00:51:45.108 --> 00:51:45.568]  Air Force.
[00:51:45.848 --> 00:51:47.290]  There's the InfoWars headline.
[00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:51.093]  Breaking octagonal object shot down over Lake Huron.
[00:51:52.054 --> 00:52:00.299]  What's really being shot down is our immune system and our medical rights and the ownership of our body and the target of our children with these poison shots all over the world, including here in the United States.
[00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:12.607]  But now we're looking up to the sky for all these balloons and other crap that have always been up there for the last few decades with private corporations, governments, you name it, flying around above the regular air travel that goes up to 40,000 feet.
[00:52:14.076 --> 00:52:16.517]  And if you think that's surveillance, you ought to think about the satellites.
[00:52:16.537 --> 00:52:20.059]  And I'm not poo-pooing that isn't important, but why is it coming out now?
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.402]  China says they went after a UFO right around U.S.
[00:52:24.442 --> 00:52:26.843]  war drills by Taiwan.
[00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:34.347]  Today, all hell is breaking loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:35.648 --> 00:52:40.391]  Now, they just had more drills this week in several cities and last week.
[00:52:41.636 --> 00:52:46.643]  With black helicopters flying around, attacking buildings they covertly leased, and troops coming out of the sky.
[00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:49.667]  And if you talk about it in the past, they'd say, oh, there weren't any black helicopters here.
[00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:52.931]  Even though one time, several times, we went and caught it on tape in Texas.
[00:52:53.291 --> 00:52:58.458]  They were doing it so much in the mid-1990s, they'd say on the news, Jones is crazy, there's no such thing as black helicopters.
[00:52:59.139 --> 00:53:00.060]  Later they admitted the whole thing.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:00.781]  So it's the same thing.
[00:53:01.481 --> 00:53:03.524]  This is all covert operations going on.
[00:53:03.564 --> 00:53:09.029]  It shows how much closer to all-out war we are with Russia and China.
[00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:13.333]  And it's that threat escalation as we go up the ladder.
[00:53:14.955 --> 00:53:17.698]  As I covered the start of the first hour, there's so much hype going on.
[00:53:19.298 --> 00:53:21.960]  The corporate media that these are flying saucers, these are aliens.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.621]  And that is ridiculous.
[00:53:23.641 --> 00:53:32.926]  I'm not saying that stuff doesn't exist in some way, or sometime, but almost always, it is a governmental operation.
[00:53:34.185 --> 00:53:37.286]  And all these major countries have a lot of hidden stuff.
[00:53:37.726 --> 00:53:39.806]  You gotta ask, why is it suddenly getting shot down?
[00:53:40.366 --> 00:53:43.147]  It's because we're going into a war footing against China.
[00:53:43.267 --> 00:53:44.747]  And during Trump, they didn't tell him.
[00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:48.488]  And before that, with Obama, they let these things fly all over the United States.
[00:53:48.828 --> 00:53:54.670]  But it is true that Trump administration had these flying above the U.S., knew about it, did nothing, because Trump was not told.
[00:53:54.970 --> 00:54:00.231]  That's now confirmed, which is the treason of Milley and all of them.
[00:54:02.631 --> 00:54:05.753]  In the White House for the four years of Trump.
[00:54:05.773 --> 00:54:09.536]  Trump was not aware of it and obviously would have done something about it.
[00:54:10.016 --> 00:54:12.778]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:54:14.039 --> 00:54:17.901]  Not because these things are new, but because they're now being targeted.
[00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:27.128]  That tells you that they have turned the page towards even greater levels of escalation as Russia prepares to invade with thousands of more tanks.
[00:54:28.254 --> 00:54:36.138]  Thousands of more helicopters and 500,000 troops preparing the new invasion is imminent.
[00:54:36.238 --> 00:54:40.920]  I believe they will launch the attack before the holiday.
[00:54:42.181 --> 00:54:42.881]  That's what it is now.
[00:54:43.422 --> 00:54:49.765]  The Russia date is like a holiday for Ukraine, a holiday in Russia, a big, a big date to look at.
[00:54:49.845 --> 00:54:53.727]  And maybe because the intel is the Russians are about to invade, maybe they'll wait till after.
[00:54:53.827 --> 00:54:54.307]  I don't know.
[00:54:54.387 --> 00:54:55.908]  But the ground will thaw.
[00:54:56.926 --> 00:55:01.407]  It'll be very, very hard for the Russians to move forward if that is the case.
[00:55:02.087 --> 00:55:04.848]  And I've been reading reports out of Russia and even reports out of the U.S.
[00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:12.190]  that basically agree with each other, but this is almost like trench warfare in World War I, where it's wave after wave of troops killing each other.
[00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:23.012]  Hundreds of thousands of dead Ukrainian troops and other mercenaries that came to join the fight, and soldiers of fortune, and then hundreds of thousands of dead Russian troops.
[00:55:23.032 --> 00:55:40.218]   This is a real war, like the Korean War, And it is extremely, extremely probable that this is going to continue to escalate on up to the highest levels of threat and responses.
[00:55:41.199 --> 00:55:42.299]  And we'll be here covering it.
[00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:44.379]  You know, I could have stayed home tonight.
[00:55:44.419 --> 00:55:45.100]  I'm not a hero.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.440]  I just am not interested in the Super Bowl.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.881]  Though as I sat down and started eating barbecue and watching the football game, I like football as much as the next person.
[00:55:52.642 --> 00:55:53.762]  But how do you do that?
[00:55:54.724 --> 00:55:58.667]  When all hell's breaking loose and every broadcast we're on air is so precious.
[00:55:59.187 --> 00:56:04.011]  And the enemies of freedom are all over the controlled news saying, we want Alex Jones off air.
[00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:06.233]  We want to silence Alex Jones.
[00:56:07.568 --> 00:56:09.129]  Well, should I silence myself, then?
[00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:18.472]  And then just sit there and shove barbecue in my mouth and watch a bunch of anti-American propaganda ads and leftist garbage and Pfizer commercials?
[00:56:19.112 --> 00:56:21.033]  And I'm not mad at you if you're watching the Super Bowl.
[00:56:21.313 --> 00:56:30.996]  The point is, though, we got lured into bread and circuses, lured into all these distractions, and that's why we're in so much trouble now, because we don't have our priorities straight.
[00:56:32.417 --> 00:56:39.194]   Owen Schroeder got into Talk Radio as a sportscaster was already successful by the age of 20, already hosting shows.
[00:56:39.935 --> 00:56:46.121]  But he woke up to the New World Order, didn't even know about it, and then became a leading light in the fight against it.
[00:56:46.161 --> 00:56:49.425]  He'll be here coming up in about 48 minutes from now.
[00:56:49.745 --> 00:56:53.889]  Toast Sunday live, 6 to 8 p.m., and I know, take your phone calls.
[00:56:54.390 --> 00:57:05.643]   I've not been taking calls tonight because I've got a lot more news I need to get to, and there's so much breaking here, but I know that Owen will be taking phone calls, because I know Owen, 6 p.m.
[00:57:05.823 --> 00:57:06.183]  Central.
[00:57:06.243 --> 00:57:07.824]  And I've been trying to get better at taking phone calls.
[00:57:08.265 --> 00:57:09.326]  During the weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:57:09.606 --> 00:57:10.927]  to 3 p.m., I've been taking a lot of them.
[00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:20.735]  Harrison Smith always takes them, but we do need to also take time out to cover the news, though callers always take us in interesting directions and are incredibly, incredibly informative.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:30.222]  Now let's get back into the censorship that's coming out, and I'm going to end this hour with a special report that's really chronicled this.
[00:57:30.242 --> 00:57:34.463]  But this is a big deal because we told you this in 2016.
[00:57:35.063 --> 00:57:46.385]  Obama signed the Defense Authorization Act of 2017, his last major legislative act, spending billions of dollars to call the American people Russians and turn the CIA and other agencies loose on us.
[00:57:46.705 --> 00:57:51.106]  And so big tech is just the enforcer of this, along with dinosaur media.
[00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:53.887]  The ruling class wanted to run America to the ground.
[00:57:53.947 --> 00:57:54.748]  America had woken up.
[00:57:54.788 --> 00:57:56.289]  America was taking their country back with Trump.
[00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:58.650]  Not that he's perfect, but that he was a manifestation of that.
[00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:02.452]  And that's why they hate Trump so much, because they hate you so much.
[00:58:03.493 --> 00:58:11.817]  The first thing Biden did when he got in was put out a new threat assessment saying it's not jihadis, it's not MS-13, it's not the Chai Koms, it's not the Russians.
[00:58:11.857 --> 00:58:23.754]   The big threat Or people that have opposition to COVID measures, or don't like lockdowns or forced injections, claims of election fraud, belief Trump can be reinstated, or the 9-11 anniversary or religious holidays.
[00:58:24.315 --> 00:58:35.342]  Now we have all these articles out demonizing Catholics of all people, and these internal FBI documents that came out where they're saying the main threat is Orthodox Catholics.
[00:58:36.459 --> 00:58:39.523]  Who are one of the most non-violent groups out there, statistically.
[00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:40.944]  It's just disgusting.
[00:58:41.305 --> 00:58:47.072]  But there's a civil war going on inside the Catholic Church for its heart and soul with this leftist pope.
[00:58:48.257 --> 00:58:50.019]  Trying to overturn every Catholic canon.
[00:58:50.039 --> 00:58:51.500]  You can say, well, Catholic Church isn't perfect.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.105]  Well, no Christian institution in America has been perfect, or anywhere in the world, since Christ came along.
[00:58:56.125 --> 00:58:57.186]  The Orthodox Church isn't perfect.
[00:58:57.386 --> 00:58:58.187]  And I'm not a Catholic.
[00:58:58.247 --> 00:58:59.268]  I'm on the Orthodox Church.
[00:58:59.648 --> 00:59:00.629]  I'm not an Evangelical.
[00:59:00.669 --> 00:59:01.330]  I'm not a Baptist.
[00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:02.751]  I am a follower of Christ.
[00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:09.258]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, but I love Jesus, and I know that the Bible's really happening, and the Mark of the Beast, and all of it.
[00:59:10.103 --> 00:59:17.285]  I've got a whole stack of articles here that I just had before I went to break, and then now I moved them around, but I'll find all my stuff on the persecution of Catholics.
[00:59:17.305 --> 00:59:30.428]  I mean, it's all over the news, you see it there, but this is just crazy that while all this is going on, they're saying right-wingers are the number one threat, and out of the right-wingers, traditionalist Catholics are the main threat.
[00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:34.769]  I mean, imagine, our government is openly saying that, but so is the Pope!
[00:59:35.612 --> 00:59:37.813]  The Pope is attacking real Catholics.
[00:59:38.293 --> 00:59:39.394]  That's really what they are.
[00:59:39.654 --> 00:59:46.037]  And in Israel, they go after the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jews and CPS their kids and force inject them.
[00:59:46.117 --> 00:59:48.199]  Why are they going after Orthodox people?
[00:59:48.839 --> 00:59:52.061]  Why is Zelensky going after the Orthodox Church in Ukraine?
[00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:59.004]  Because they are old school and aren't globalist controlled and they represent what's left of the original people that are faithful.
[00:59:59.985 --> 01:00:00.285]  Okay?
[01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:01.365]  That's what's going on.
[01:00:01.205 --> 01:00:04.564]   We all need to band together as real Christians with the Bible.
[01:00:04.564 --> 01:00:07.025]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:00:07.025 --> 01:00:09.984]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:00:09.984 --> 01:00:26.685]   So if people were sitting down in the 1950s or something, and they were wondering, I wonder
[01:00:26.685 --> 01:00:30.044]  what is going to take place over the next 20 years.
[01:00:29.305 --> 01:00:39.192]  And if you think about, you know, the Kennedy assassination is coming, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, the hippie explosion, psychedelia, all the rest of it.
[01:00:39.672 --> 01:00:42.534]  I mean, it is impossible to predict.
[01:00:43.035 --> 01:00:47.918]   The concept of deep events that Professor Scott came up with, And we've seen deep events.
[01:00:47.998 --> 01:00:53.119]  The deep events are caused by a group, the deep state in this case.
[01:00:53.879 --> 01:01:06.421]  So like a Iran-Contra or the 2008 financial crisis, where they said, you know, if you don't give us all that money out of the Treasury, there's going to be martial law to the Congress people.
[01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:13.302]  The COVID operation, Iran-Contra, 9-11, things of this nature.
[01:01:13.342 --> 01:01:14.283]  Those are deep events.
[01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:21.311]   What happens is This group that is working side by side with us comes in.
[01:01:23.052 --> 01:01:31.914]  The covert group comes in, they do some kind of deep event to get a policy change across the board, sometimes worldwide.
[01:01:33.054 --> 01:01:35.335]  And then they step back and they leave all the rubble.
[01:01:36.118 --> 01:01:46.684]  Of what they've done and people look for the trails back to, you know, I mean, actually most of the time people just get, get on with their lives and are just like, well, I don't know what just happened, but I'm going to try to deal with it.
[01:01:47.364 --> 01:01:50.326]  But the, the tracks lead back somewhere.
[01:01:51.147 --> 01:01:53.828]  And so another deep event is coming.
[01:01:54.909 --> 01:02:04.114]  The UFO file and the UFO threat being the deep event for me, uh, is in the cards and I feel like it's pretty close.
[01:02:05.174 --> 01:02:21.608]  So therefore, when I see this kind of activity, and I see the continuity of government players up front as the front people for it, talking about it, and also creating spin about, oh, hey, we didn't know, you know, the balloons escaped our sensors and stuff.
[01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:22.149]  No way.
[01:02:22.816 --> 01:02:23.136]  No way.
[01:02:23.376 --> 01:02:24.237]  I know that they're lying.
[01:02:24.557 --> 01:02:25.677]  So that is unnerving.
[01:02:26.418 --> 01:02:32.221]  And it lets me know that their timetable is afloat.
[01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:34.642]  You know, it's away.
[01:02:37.283 --> 01:02:38.204]  That's dark journalism.
[01:02:38.224 --> 01:02:38.944]  That's what he goes by.
[01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:39.785]  Dead on.
[01:02:39.825 --> 01:02:42.346]  The deep state needs a crisis.
[01:02:42.406 --> 01:02:46.768]  And I've said it's cyber attacks, wars, or it could be the fake alien invasion.
[01:02:46.788 --> 01:02:49.970]  And certainly they're hyping that now at fever pitch.
[01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:52.551]  So continuing, U.S.
[01:02:52.571 --> 01:02:56.154]  State Department funding secret disinformation crusade to blacklist conservatives.
[01:02:57.054 --> 01:02:58.555]  It's all public now in Congress.
[01:02:59.236 --> 01:03:03.339]  Germany pressures Twitter to commit to censorship law.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.060]  So does the U.N.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.441]  See how we're under world government already?
[01:03:06.461 --> 01:03:10.905]  We have the tyrannical clown show compilation coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[01:03:10.925 --> 01:03:11.726]  We're going to be pairing.
[01:03:12.586 --> 01:03:17.710]  And remember what happened to Laura Loomer and myself and Paul Watson and nine others.
[01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:20.592]  Nine others in April of 2020.
[01:03:24.192 --> 01:03:28.674]  The globalist-controlled Facebook came out and said there are now people called dangerous individuals.
[01:03:28.694 --> 01:03:29.954]  There's only 12 of them on the earth.
[01:03:30.494 --> 01:03:33.155]  They weren't Chinese dictators or North Korean dictators.
[01:03:34.056 --> 01:03:35.496]  No, it wasn't Hunter Biden.
[01:03:35.756 --> 01:03:41.479]  It was Alex Jones, Laura Loomer, Paul Joseph Watson, Gab McGinnis, Louis Faircon and a few others.
[01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:48.001]  And they said in the document, we have a shot of it here, that you are allowed to call for violence against them.
[01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:52.883]  The original rule was we're all banned and if you say something positive, you could be banned.
[01:03:54.156 --> 01:04:00.362]  Their new rule, which they pulled down in about two days after this, was that you could call for our death.
[01:04:02.043 --> 01:04:03.625]  Well, she's filed a lawsuit over that.
[01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:04.966]  It's actually moving ahead.
[01:04:07.468 --> 01:04:08.089]  Facebook Inc.
[01:04:08.189 --> 01:04:11.932]  asked a Miami federal judge to throw out a lawsuit by a conspiracy theorist, Laura Limmer.
[01:04:11.972 --> 01:04:15.575]  Well, we went to Congress and told them this four years ago, and it's all been proven right.
[01:04:15.876 --> 01:04:20.360]  Saying her ban under the dangerous individuals and organizations policy wasn't defamatory.
[01:04:21.411 --> 01:04:24.653]  Because reasonable minds can disagree about whether she's dangerous.
[01:04:24.893 --> 01:04:31.117]  But they use that designation to set the government on her and put her on all sorts of government harassment lists.
[01:04:31.578 --> 01:04:31.898]  While Ms.
[01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:40.143]  Loomer may not believe she is dangerous or that she promotes hate, others disagree and demonstrate by her admission that online platforms have widely banned her.
[01:04:40.564 --> 01:04:45.647]  Oh, because they all, Tech Giant says, because they all worked in concert, that's okay!
[01:04:47.248 --> 01:04:56.310]   Because there was a consensus There's a consensus that we should euthanize the young people and the depressed and the anorexic and the old.
[01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:57.810]  Daily Mail.
[01:04:58.631 --> 01:04:59.571]  New York Times.
[01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.813]  Meanwhile, they're not just shipping in fentanyl, dissolving the borders, brainwashing our children.
[01:05:06.934 --> 01:05:09.895]  They're defunding the police in all these critical areas and crime's exploding.
[01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:11.615]  Hands off D.C.
[01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:16.017]  Local reporter upset GOP voted against Capitol soft on crime bill.
[01:05:17.645 --> 01:05:23.689]  Republicans are demanding answers that the DOJ, FBI attempted to label Catholics as potential terrorists.
[01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:25.270]  They said they were the main threat.
[01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:26.170]  Townhall.com.
[01:05:27.731 --> 01:05:29.492]  This is out of the French News, French 24.
[01:05:30.152 --> 01:05:34.935]  Pope Francis faces civil war at heart of the church as he tries to ban the Latin mass and more.
[01:05:35.656 --> 01:05:36.776]  What's the FBI says bad?
[01:05:36.836 --> 01:05:37.517]  Latin mass.
[01:05:38.457 --> 01:05:39.318]  All words are bad.
[01:05:39.358 --> 01:05:40.018]  They're old.
[01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:44.637]   things that are tradition or evil you must accept the new tradition. The new
[01:05:44.637 --> 01:05:49.116]   tradition. Smithsonian is about to get a brutal lesson in constitutional rights
[01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:54.518]   as they kicked out Catholic students for wearing pro-life hats. You can wear your
[01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:58.518]  drag queen pedophile time hat.
[01:05:56.666 --> 01:06:02.068]  You can do that, but you can't wear a hat in a public building paid for by the people that they don't like.
[01:06:02.488 --> 01:06:03.609]  A dreadful coincidence.
[01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:08.431]  A second New Jersey council member is shot dead in their car, but officials don't think they're linked.
[01:06:08.571 --> 01:06:13.151]   Democrats say crime dropped even though the FBI took over 900 cities last year
[01:06:13.151 --> 01:06:17.211]  off the crime database to claim that.
[01:06:17.211 --> 01:06:23.069]   Representative Angel Craig assaulted in DC apartment building.
[01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:24.894]  I mean, this is just every day.
[01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:27.561]  This is just pouring out.
[01:06:28.513 --> 01:06:32.636]  Examples of all of this and it gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:06:32.937 --> 01:06:38.481]  I want to talk about the shut off of our energy and the rollout of the new digital currency that isn't imminent.
[01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:41.964]  It's happening now in the next segment.
[01:06:41.984 --> 01:06:45.827]  We've also got some James O'Keefe update for you.
[01:06:45.847 --> 01:06:48.369]  What we thought was going on is happening.
[01:06:48.389 --> 01:06:52.312]  It is a coup against him for the great work he's done.
[01:06:52.332 --> 01:06:54.194]  And I want to play a clip.
[01:06:55.776 --> 01:06:57.697]  That's 30-something years old.
[01:06:58.538 --> 01:06:59.498]  A very great man.
[01:07:00.599 --> 01:07:01.780]  And that's Fletcher Prouty.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.822]  Talking about the plan to shut off your energy and more.
[01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:09.864]  That is coming up on the other side.
[01:07:09.924 --> 01:07:12.026]  Please don't forget we're listener and viewer supported.

[01:08:40.898 --> 01:08:41.659]  InfoWarStore.com.

[01:08:45.481 --> 01:08:48.443]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[01:08:48.262 --> 01:08:50.262]  Oh, and Ulta Bell Brass is finally back in stock.
[01:08:50.262 --> 01:08:53.742]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:53.742 --> 01:08:58.222]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:58.222 --> 01:09:10.342]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:09:10.342 --> 01:09:14.582]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:17.742]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:17.742 --> 01:09:22.301]   All right, so whether you're in Japan, whether you're in China, whether you're in Europe,
[01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:25.582]   whether you're in the United States or Canada, all the big private central banks
[01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:31.381]   that masquerade as government bodies, same groups own it, they have been saying that they're
[01:09:31.381 --> 01:09:36.222]   going to roll out a new digital currency, but they need a big event to collapse the regular currency.
[01:09:36.222 --> 01:09:38.662]  And then the new digital currency--
[01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.808]  We'll be around while the old currency is still around, and they'll phase that one out.
[01:09:41.128 --> 01:09:43.892]  But the new one will be accepted at all the big stores and places.
[01:09:44.272 --> 01:09:46.435]  All the old currency, starting with cash, will not be.
[01:09:46.796 --> 01:09:50.340]  And these central bank digital currencies will track everything you do, control what you do.
[01:09:50.681 --> 01:09:51.822]  We've talked about it at Nozium.
[01:09:51.862 --> 01:09:53.003]  It's the Holy Grail of control.
[01:09:54.278 --> 01:10:02.002]  So I always talk about the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundations are the main ones that run the CIA and run the policy pretty much of most of the world.
[01:10:02.383 --> 01:10:13.269]  And Hillary was just speaking there, saying we need to weaponize global warming, we need to bring in this new cashless digital currency to fight climate change, that cash hurts the earth.
[01:10:14.482 --> 01:10:19.864]  Not just your cows, not just your children, but just living is bad, and paper money is bad.
[01:10:20.004 --> 01:10:22.405]  We've got to cut trees down to cut the carbon.
[01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:24.906]  I mean, this is just a total war on reality.
[01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:32.890]  Here is the deputy head of the Clinton Foundation, the globalist monster herself, morphing into George Soros, pushing this evil agenda.
[01:10:36.251 --> 01:11:06.736]   So today I am proud to announce that the Clinton Global Initiative, started by my husband, We'll work closely with SEWA and with our partners, the American India Foundation, the Adrian Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, the Desai Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, and the Algorand Foundation,
[01:11:07.356 --> 01:11:14.778]  To launch a 50 million dollar global climate resilient fund for women.
[01:11:16.678 --> 01:11:31.262]  This fund will empower women and your communities to have access to resources that will make you more resilient to the effects of climate change like extreme heat.
[01:11:32.882 --> 01:11:45.508]   It will also help provide New livelihoods and educational opportunities and provide the kind of transition we see here today.
[01:11:46.249 --> 01:11:58.742]  You're using the solar panels to fuel the work in the salt pans, then you take the solar panels home to provide electricity in your villages and even provide it to the grid.
[01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:16.584]  I also want to connect you with global carbon markets so that you... Yeah, you'll only be allowed to spend the digital money where they say and it's directly tied to this global environmental governance.
[01:12:16.604 --> 01:12:19.106]  You can read the whole article with the initiative they're pushing.
[01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:32.133]   It's on Infowars.com by Jamie White and it lays out banning cash and bringing in this new digital system and The good news is humanity's rejecting this.
[01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:34.714]  The bad news is Bill Gates just put in $50 million a week ago.
[01:12:35.274 --> 01:12:39.236]  All these big global foundations are kicking in money to basically force the adoption of this.
[01:12:39.736 --> 01:12:47.880]  And already farmers across the world are deciding not to plant crops and being given carbon money instead, which can only be traded on these carbon exchanges.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.601]  They're trying to bring these in right now.
[01:12:51.502 --> 01:12:51.782]  Okay.
[01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:55.425]  I want to talk about this.
[01:12:55.585 --> 01:12:59.748]  Climate change activist goes rogue releasing mini-volcanoes to cool atmosphere.
[01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.969]  MSN.com.
[01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:11.137]  And it's really a group founded by the UN and Bill Gates, saying the Earth is so bad we need to do strategic aerosolized spraying with sulfur dioxide and other things in the air to cool the Earth.
[01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:13.459]  Something they've already been doing, but it doesn't really cool the Earth.
[01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:16.281]  It manipulates weather patterns for total control.
[01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:19.824]  But they always say, oh, we're bringing out global cashless society for poor women in Africa.
[01:13:20.285 --> 01:13:22.726]  Oh, we've got little small groups creating fake...
[01:13:23.527 --> 01:13:27.027]  artificial volcanoes to save the earth, terra farming, geoengineering.
[01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:30.865]   Oh, it's little groups doing it, little groups doing it, but they give them the money,
[01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:35.426]   then they're just the front groups for all this crazy mad scientist control.
[01:13:35.426 --> 01:13:42.306]   Now, let's go back to when oil was just first being discovered and brought forward by the Rockefellers and
[01:13:42.306 --> 01:13:42.827]  others.
[01:13:42.827 --> 01:13:49.426]   I, Fletcher Prouty, was one of the top colonels who ran black ops and overthrew more than a dozen governments
[01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:55.127]   in the famous JFK movie that's more like a documentary than a Hollywood film.
[01:13:55.128 --> 01:14:01.313]  There's a character in there, played by Peter Sutherland, who's there talking to Jim Garrison.
[01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:06.317]  That's really who gave him how Kennedy was killed and why the movie's so accurate and why people knew what really happened.
[01:14:06.837 --> 01:14:12.842]  But Prouty was so smart, he was in with the top people but didn't agree with what they were doing as he got older and went public against it.
[01:14:13.542 --> 01:14:22.790]  Crowdy explains why they're telling you oil isn't plentiful when they now know oil wells almost everywhere after a few years start filling back up.
[01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:24.431]  The earth is just full of it.
[01:14:24.451 --> 01:14:25.532]  There's so much of it, it's crazy.
[01:14:25.552 --> 01:14:30.877]  It's like they've discovered enough coal to run all the civilization we have for more than 10,000 years and a clean way to burn it.
[01:14:31.097 --> 01:14:35.440]  So we don't have an energy problem, but they want you to think there is an energy problem.
[01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:40.625]  So here's a documentary in the early 1990s that he was in talking about this incredible reality.
[01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:51.559]  You mentioned in one of your last talks that petroleum wasn't what we thought it was, that it wasn't a fossil fuel, that it didn't come from fossil animals.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.200]  Is it just a mineral?
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.421]  Is it a mineral like any other mineral?
[01:14:56.341 --> 01:15:03.543]  Is that how it, what would you say, what's the origin of it?
[01:15:05.871 --> 01:15:24.217]  When they first found petroleum, because they were beginning to make motors, and needed it on axles of wheels, on railroad trains, and all that sort of thing, and remember, trains started in the beginning of the 19th century, then oil went from just a lubricant to a fuel, and it made it valuable.
[01:15:25.318 --> 01:15:34.561]  And Rockefeller happened to be the smartest man in the business at the time, but he made a lot of most of his money, or much of it, off the transport of the petroleum, as well as selling it.
[01:15:35.868 --> 01:15:44.852]  But, one thing they realized was, if you, because oil, putting a price on oil is like putting a price on a pail of water.
[01:15:45.072 --> 01:15:52.554]  You know, no initial cost is in the ground, and in those days they were, some of it, almost what you'd call surface mining the oil.
[01:15:52.574 --> 01:15:53.535]  They didn't go down deep.
[01:15:54.735 --> 01:16:00.118]   So, in order to get the price up, They hit on the idea that they would have to make it appear to be scarce.
[01:16:00.378 --> 01:16:05.259]  That, boy, after we take the next few barrels out, we're probably going to have to close as well.
[01:16:05.279 --> 01:16:06.139]  You know, that kind of thing.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.260]  A very fortuitous event.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:20.523]  In 1892, there was a convention in Geneva of scientists to determine what organic substances are.
[01:16:21.564 --> 01:16:26.305]  Well, the definition of organic is a substance with hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.
[01:16:27.091 --> 01:16:29.912]  And so, it's usually a living substance, a tree.
[01:16:30.532 --> 01:16:34.093]  You analyze a dead tree, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen.
[01:16:34.854 --> 01:16:36.154]  And grass, and so on.
[01:16:36.234 --> 01:16:37.094]  Living things.
[01:16:37.655 --> 01:16:38.095]  Animals.
[01:16:38.355 --> 01:16:40.876]  We are hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.
[01:16:41.776 --> 01:16:54.240]  So, at this Geneva Convention, Rockefeller took advantage of sending some scientists over, who said, oil, petroleum, is hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.
[01:16:55.066 --> 01:17:04.769]  Therefore, it must be derived from the spoiling, the rotting of formerly living matter.
[01:17:05.849 --> 01:17:15.572]  And playing the game properly, when the scientific convention was over, they defined oil as a residue from formerly living matter.
[01:17:16.513 --> 01:17:25.077]   And he goes on to say in the film, which we all know to be true now, that they did this to make it sound like oil is artificially Running out.
[01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:31.019]  Or it's really running out, but they're really artificially creating scarcity to control people.
[01:17:31.059 --> 01:17:34.100]  And they don't give you new technologies that actually bridge it that are better.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.882]  All these battery-driven systems are hundreds of times more toxic with the mining and all.
[01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:39.742]  Just total nightmares.
[01:17:39.762 --> 01:17:40.682]  That's not denied.
[01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:44.123]  And it's not sustainable.
[01:17:44.444 --> 01:17:46.764]  But they want a post-industrial world.
[01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:48.025]  They've been on record.
[01:17:48.045 --> 01:17:48.785]  That's what they want.
[01:17:49.973 --> 01:17:57.039]  And the moment we've all got to reach here, not just our audience of great people, but those that serve the system, you better learn about how the world really works.
[01:17:57.419 --> 01:17:59.381]  You better learn about the globalist plans for you and your family.
[01:18:00.021 --> 01:18:06.767]  You better learn about their master plans and their program for you and not just sit there like a spectator because this system will destroy you and your children.
[01:18:07.287 --> 01:18:08.529]  We warned you of this decades ago.
[01:18:08.549 --> 01:18:10.290]  Fletcher Prouty warned you 30, 40 years ago.
[01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:11.491]  He was a top insider.
[01:18:12.232 --> 01:18:14.473]  Now you're living what these people warned us about.
[01:18:14.854 --> 01:18:15.875]  That's how I know all this stuff.
[01:18:15.895 --> 01:18:16.795]  People like Fletcher Prouty.
[01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:18.537]  He was one of the granddaddies of it all.
[01:18:19.329 --> 01:18:20.189]  Exposing the whole agenda.
[01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:21.370]  He was at the top level with them.
[01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:22.170]  He knows all of it.
[01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:23.190]  He knew all of it.
[01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:26.171]  So, you don't get ahead working with these people.
[01:18:26.231 --> 01:18:27.151]  You get destroyed.
[01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:31.872]  They always give you a little ticket fee to sign on, but it's like mouse cheese on the mousetrap.
[01:18:31.952 --> 01:18:32.612]  It kills you.
[01:18:32.632 --> 01:18:34.673]  Not gonna have to wait for the tyranny.
[01:18:34.733 --> 01:18:35.793]  Now you're in it, folks.
[01:18:36.193 --> 01:18:37.193]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:38.314]  InfoWars.com.
[01:18:38.134 --> 01:18:49.613]  Tom, tomorrow's news today.
[01:18:50.018 --> 01:18:53.861]  Yeah, we're not watching the Super Bowl, folks, because it doesn't matter.
[01:18:54.321 --> 01:18:56.643]  The future matters, and we're so close to beating these people.
[01:18:57.043 --> 01:19:02.467]  The Globalists admit they're in deep trouble, so I'm not going to sit on my butt while these people win.
[01:19:02.487 --> 01:19:05.169]  I want to thank you all for your support, your word of mouth, and your prayer.
[01:19:06.138 --> 01:19:11.921]  ConspiracyFact.info is just a simple page that has a live feed of my show and Owen's show and the other great InfoWars shows.
[01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:13.041]  I suggest you share the link.
[01:19:13.321 --> 01:19:19.044]  ConspiracyFact.info and of course InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and Band.Video.
[01:19:19.064 --> 01:19:26.567]  Not just for my films, but documentaries and reports and live shows, but hundreds of other band contributors off the internet.
[01:19:26.908 --> 01:19:29.369]  You can find them all at Band.Video.
[01:19:30.439 --> 01:19:35.891]  One exciting thing is that so many of those banned people in the last three years, four years, that were on Banned.Video get back on Twitter.
[01:19:36.823 --> 01:19:39.925]  They are not lovingly pushing people back at band.
[01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:43.327]  Then again, we're getting a ton of traffic from that saying, Hey, see my full report here.
[01:19:43.627 --> 01:19:44.627]  See my channel here.
[01:19:45.028 --> 01:19:46.969]  See what we're covering here in case we get banned again.
[01:19:47.309 --> 01:19:48.750]  That is so smart.
[01:19:49.010 --> 01:20:00.296]  Use the big establishment platforms to plug alternative platforms like InfoWars.com and Rumble and Gab and Parler and so many of the other great, amazing sites that are there.
[01:20:01.256 --> 01:20:09.618]   I want to air a John Bowne compilation he put together from this week's insane Twitter hearings. And again, this all goes for the other big tech
[01:20:09.618 --> 01:20:15.057]   as well. Twitter was the lowest level of the big tech. It's still big, but it's
[01:20:15.057 --> 01:20:18.907]   the little guy on the totem pole. Imagine what is in the Facebook documents.
[01:20:18.907 --> 01:20:22.787]   Well, that's coming out in the Google documents and the Apple documents and the
[01:20:22.787 --> 01:20:26.137]   Spotify documents. I mean, all that stuff starting to come out. So
[01:20:26.137 --> 01:20:28.627]   here's this extended report. It doesn't normally do eight and a half
[01:20:28.627 --> 01:20:29.717]  minute, nine minute reports.
[01:20:29.717 --> 01:20:34.358]  We're gonna air this report. We're gonna go to break.
[01:20:32.614 --> 01:20:34.855]  We're going to come back with Owen Schroer and Sunday Night Live.
[01:20:35.196 --> 01:20:43.081]  If a local station isn't carrying it, ask them to, but anybody can find it on the satellite or at InfoWars.com forward slash show or at ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:44.802]  So be great InfoWarriors.
[01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:45.663]  Share that link now.
[01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:47.743]  Here is Jon Bowen's report.
[01:20:47.743 --> 01:20:54.743]  [Music]
[01:20:54.743 --> 01:21:00.393]   Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
[01:21:00.393 --> 01:21:00.743]  the truth?
[01:21:00.743 --> 01:21:02.743]  So help you God?
[01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.933]  Let the record show that the witnesses all entered in the affirmative.
[01:21:06.213 --> 01:21:14.461]  The fired, treasonous clowns of Twitter faced the truth and their accusers at a Republican Majority House Oversight Committee.
[01:21:14.881 --> 01:21:20.947]  I did not act unlawfully or otherwise inappropriately in any manner with respect to Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:21:21.107 --> 01:21:26.813]  While I was at Twitter, the company never lost sight of its deep commitment to promoting and defending free expression around the world.
[01:21:27.153 --> 01:21:31.758]  In nearly eight years at Twitter, I worked in and led a division called Trust and Safety.
[01:21:31.938 --> 01:21:39.446]  The gray area of this work, though, is when Trust and Safety teams have to make decisions about so-called lawful but awful material.
[01:21:40.086 --> 01:21:45.568]  Content that may be legal in many jurisdictions, but isn't something most people would want to experience.
[01:21:46.108 --> 01:21:50.810]  Unrestricted free speech, paradoxically, results in less speech, not more.
[01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:55.732]  It was our job in Trust and Safety to try to strike an appropriate balance.
[01:21:56.212 --> 01:22:03.175]  Every day, we had to decide whether a particular piece of content equated to yelling fire in a crowded theater.
[01:22:03.475 --> 01:22:05.936]  Well, Mr. Ralph, did you write this tweet?
[01:22:06.673 --> 01:22:10.795]  I regret the language that I used in some of my former tweets, but yes, I did post that.
[01:22:11.236 --> 01:22:17.239]  Yes, that person in the pink hat is clearly a bigger threat to your brand of feminism than actual Nazis in the White House.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.981]  Mr. Ross, do you think all conservatives are Nazis?
[01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:21.702]  Certainly not, sir.
[01:22:22.122 --> 01:22:22.522]  Did Ms.
[01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:25.444]  Gaddy or any other lawyer at Twitter ever tell you to take down that tweet?
[01:22:25.824 --> 01:22:30.627]  No, Twitter did not have a practice of restricting employees sharing their personal viewpoints on the service.
[01:22:31.089 --> 01:22:32.450]  Twitter placed ads from U.S.
[01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:43.154]  companies including Amazon, Disney, McDonald's, and on the Twitter accounts of the Taliban news organization and their spokespersons and their senior leaders.
[01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:43.414]  Ms.
[01:22:43.434 --> 01:22:52.978]  Gatti, did Twitter make money off placed ads on Taliban Twitter accounts on August 26, 2021, when 13 U.S.
[01:22:53.178 --> 01:22:55.419]  men and women died in a suicide bombing?
[01:22:55.819 --> 01:22:57.080]  I have no knowledge of this matter.
[01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:02.817]  Unexpectedly, the hearing experienced a dubious power outage.
[01:23:03.137 --> 01:23:15.901]  When order out of chaos had been restored, Democrats rallied to essentially protect their donor class cabal in Silicon Valley, no matter the damage or violation it represented towards the Republic.
[01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.662]  We should be talking about the threats to our democracy.
[01:23:19.122 --> 01:23:32.728]  That's the real threat, not an old article that seemingly couldn't reach the viewership it sought through its own platform to disparage and attempt to skew the election in favor of a twice-impeached former president who lost a secure and fair election.
[01:23:33.248 --> 01:23:38.310]  You stated that Donald Trump described his own tweets as little missiles.
[01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:40.891]  Why did that stick in your mind?
[01:23:42.011 --> 01:23:42.432]  Yes, I...
[01:23:44.039 --> 01:23:55.883]  The quote that you're referring to, I don't remember exactly what news article that it was in, but it was a news article that I had read in which the former president said that he likes to send out his tweets like little missiles.
[01:23:56.443 --> 01:24:03.126]  To me, that sounded exactly like weaponization of a platform in his own words, and yet Twitter was not concerned.
[01:24:03.726 --> 01:24:07.969]  Free speech is about the government limiting speech about the public.
[01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:10.590]  My governor, Ron DeSantis, is doing that right now.
[01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:15.933]  I have a venue in my district that he's revoking the liquor license of trying to close because they had a drag show.
[01:24:16.174 --> 01:24:18.315]  They want the ability to inject this again.
[01:24:18.915 --> 01:24:22.437]  So they've dragged a social media platform here in Congress.
[01:24:22.838 --> 01:24:24.699]  They're weaponizing the use of this committee.
[01:24:25.419 --> 01:24:26.399]  So that they can do it again.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:34.502]  We could be talking about abortion rights, civil rights, voting rights, but instead we're talking about Hunter Biden's half-fake laptop story.
[01:24:34.682 --> 01:24:45.225]  While Republicans bore down on the ugly truth, uncovering layers of manipulation by a deep state unleashing its control over American free speech.
[01:24:45.645 --> 01:24:56.996]   The reason that we've had this hearing is because the laptop has been Mislabeled by many in the mainstream media as being Russian disinformation.
[01:24:57.577 --> 01:25:01.920]  Apparently the views of a Stanford doctor are disinformation to you people.
[01:25:02.521 --> 01:25:04.342]  So my first question this morning of Ms.
[01:25:04.362 --> 01:25:08.125]  Gatti, may I ask of you, where did you go to medical school?
[01:25:10.187 --> 01:25:11.268]  I did not go to medical school.
[01:25:11.448 --> 01:25:11.848]  I'm sorry?
[01:25:11.868 --> 01:25:13.249]  I did not go to medical school.
[01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:13.850]  That's what I thought.
[01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:21.536]  You, ladies and gentlemen, interfered with the United States of America 2020 presidential election, knowingly and willingly.
[01:25:22.281 --> 01:25:23.402]  That's the bad news.
[01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:24.383]  It's going to get worse.
[01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:27.245]  Because this is the investigation part.
[01:25:27.705 --> 01:25:29.487]  Later comes the arrest part.
[01:25:30.127 --> 01:25:45.520]  As the questioning continued, the ex-executives gradually revealed that either they were lying to Congress, which could land them each up to five years in prison, or the real culprits behind the scenes had not yet been called as witnesses.
[01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:48.863]  Who advocated for the removal of the New York Post story?
[01:25:49.483 --> 01:25:52.149]  The company's decision to treat it as a violation.
[01:25:52.209 --> 01:25:55.797]  Mr. Roth, who at the company actually went over your recommendation?
[01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.618]  Because you're pretty high up.
[01:25:58.062 --> 01:25:58.783]  Who overrode you?
[01:25:59.810 --> 01:26:02.391]  The decision was communicated to me by my direct supervisor.
[01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:03.111]  Who was that person?
[01:26:03.631 --> 01:26:04.731]  Her name was Del Harvey.
[01:26:04.831 --> 01:26:17.774]  Mr. Matt Taibbi, a respected reporter who published much of the Twitter files, said, quote, Twitter's contact with FBI was constant and pervasive, as if it were a subsidiary.
[01:26:18.294 --> 01:26:21.594]  Now, I want to better understand why he would suggest that.
[01:26:22.134 --> 01:26:26.655]  Mr. Roth, while at Twitter, how many meetings did you have with the FBI?
[01:26:26.675 --> 01:26:28.916]  I couldn't say for sure, but I would say... More than 10?
[01:26:30.117 --> 01:26:31.065]  That's a reasonable estimate.
[01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:31.287]  More than 20?
[01:26:32.461 --> 01:26:33.262]  I couldn't say for sure.
[01:26:33.542 --> 01:26:48.813]  And as CNN and others celebrated the Democrats' position, it became abundantly clear that there is no end in sight for the Democrats and Mockingbird Media's campaign of learned helplessness foisted upon the American people.
[01:26:49.153 --> 01:27:01.603]  Republican Representative Anna Luna smacked down, rewarded her with a sloppy propaganda hit piece, hastily thrown together by the Mockingbird Media CIA hub, The Washington Post.
[01:27:02.503 --> 01:27:05.224]  Their undertone of their article was incredibly racist.
[01:27:05.264 --> 01:27:07.985]  They tried to undercut my Hispanic heritage.
[01:27:08.025 --> 01:27:11.146]  They even spoke to my mother and didn't report a lot of what she was posting.
[01:27:11.186 --> 01:27:14.207]  So the Washington Post is compost and they should do better.
[01:27:14.447 --> 01:27:25.951]  Can you explain to me why the federal government would ever have interest in communicating through JIRA, mind you, a private cloud server, with social media companies without oversight to censor American voices?
[01:27:26.031 --> 01:27:28.932]  I want to let you know that this is a violation of the First Amendment.
[01:27:29.392 --> 01:27:33.495]  And the federal government is colluding with social media companies to censor Americans.
[01:27:33.595 --> 01:27:57.634]  A screenshot behind me, which is an example of one of thousands, shows on November 3, 2020, that you, Mr. Roth, a Twitter employee, were exchanging communications on JIRA, a private cloud server, with CISA, NASS, NASED, and Alex Thomas, who now works at Stanford and is a former security officer at Facebook, to remove a posting.
[01:27:58.294 --> 01:28:02.555]  Do you now remember communicating on a private cloud server to remove a posting?
[01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:06.836]  I wouldn't agree with the characterization that this... I don't care if you agree.
[01:28:06.856 --> 01:28:07.677]  This is your stuff.
[01:28:08.037 --> 01:28:14.078]  Yes or no, did you communicate with a private entity, the government agency, on a private cloud server?
[01:28:14.139 --> 01:28:14.559]  Yes or no?
[01:28:15.399 --> 01:28:17.119]  The question was if I... Yes or no?
[01:28:17.439 --> 01:28:17.920]  I'm on time.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:18.340]  Yes or no?
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.420]  Ma'am, I don't believe I can give you a yes or no.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.041]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now that you did and we have proof of it.
[01:28:23.061 --> 01:28:25.922]  Mr. Chairman, point of order.
[01:28:27.185 --> 01:28:35.233]  Yeah, I just want to call to the attention of the chair and members that we're getting awfully close to witness intimidation.
[01:28:35.653 --> 01:28:38.656]  What is the committee's policy around threatening a witness?
[01:28:38.676 --> 01:28:46.884]  Around the rules of decorum, can we agree that threatening a witness comes close to broaching general decorum?
[01:28:47.044 --> 01:28:49.527]  It does broach general decorum of the committee?
[01:28:51.874 --> 01:28:57.377]  With all due respect, Mr. Cassio, of course, we don't agree that there was any witness threatening.
[01:28:58.478 --> 01:29:05.681]  Meanwhile, a myriad of websites suspiciously went down simultaneously on the day of this Twitter hearing.
[01:29:05.962 --> 01:29:14.226]  Was it possible that somewhere someone was very nervous and that a blow had been struck against the hull of the New World Order?
[01:29:14.645 --> 01:29:21.645]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:29:21.645 --> 01:29:44.364]   So I had a a distant relative suffering from seizures and they they called me and asked me what should we get?
[01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:53.294]  And I said, look, you should try CBD, because CBD-A has this effect with people, and, you know, anti-seizure effects.
[01:29:53.694 --> 01:29:54.654]  And I said, you've got to try this.
[01:29:54.694 --> 01:29:59.957]  So I bought, on your store, two vials of your CBD, 1,000 milligrams.
[01:30:00.397 --> 01:30:02.718]  I couldn't believe the price that you had.
[01:30:03.218 --> 01:30:04.359]  It was so low.
[01:30:04.819 --> 01:30:09.803]  The value of that, if people know this industry, the price is very good.
[01:30:10.463 --> 01:30:12.325]  I sent a bottle to my family member.
[01:30:12.485 --> 01:30:13.566]  I kept the bottle for myself.
[01:30:14.166 --> 01:30:18.029]  And then my family member was using it, having amazing results.
[01:30:18.069 --> 01:30:19.190]  I sent the bottle.
[01:30:19.986 --> 01:30:31.035]  Well, my lab director was working on a new method to quantitate cannabinoids, about 10 or 12 of them, using a single 4-minute method on an LC-MS instrument, a mass spec instrument.
[01:30:31.456 --> 01:30:35.920]  And she asked me, hey, do you have a sample of CBD oil that we can test on this method?
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:37.481]  And I said, okay, sure.
[01:30:37.821 --> 01:30:39.483]  So I gave her a sample blind.
[01:30:40.163 --> 01:30:43.004]  She didn't know it was Infowars or any brand or anything.
[01:30:43.044 --> 01:30:43.944]  Gave it to her blind.
[01:30:44.444 --> 01:30:47.705]  She ran the sample, got the results, and, wow, this is a full profile.
[01:30:47.725 --> 01:30:48.546]  It's a full spectrum.
[01:30:48.726 --> 01:30:49.846]  It's got CBD-A in it.
[01:30:49.906 --> 01:30:51.227]  I said, yeah, of course it does.
[01:30:51.607 --> 01:30:52.407]  It's got CBD.
[01:30:52.727 --> 01:30:54.968]  And it's, you know, super, super low THC.
[01:30:55.228 --> 01:30:57.048]  We'll test for Delta 9 and all that stuff.
[01:30:57.649 --> 01:31:01.830]  And I asked her, I said, OK, you've tested about 100 CBD products.
[01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:06.291]  What do you think this product would cost in the marketplace, just looking at the lab results?
[01:31:06.731 --> 01:31:07.032]  She said, $150.
[01:31:09.249 --> 01:31:11.451]  You know, in the same volume that you have.
[01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:12.712]  I just looked at your store.
[01:31:13.192 --> 01:31:17.656]  This is, I think, $67 or $68 on InfoWars store.
[01:31:18.917 --> 01:31:19.837]  No joke, Alex.
[01:31:19.897 --> 01:31:27.884]  And you know, you didn't ask me to talk about this, but I got to tell you, just independently, this CBD product that you have is an outstanding value.
[01:31:28.044 --> 01:31:28.584]  It's outstanding.
[01:31:28.644 --> 01:31:31.026]  I'm taking it myself, and it's helping my family members.
[01:31:31.066 --> 01:31:32.587]  So I just want to put that on the record.
[01:31:32.647 --> 01:31:33.268]  It's the real deal.
[01:31:33.428 --> 01:31:34.769]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:31:34.809 --> 01:31:35.590]  I didn't know that happened.
[01:31:35.630 --> 01:31:38.292]  I mean, here's all that happened with the InfoWars MD line.
[01:31:38.972 --> 01:31:44.614]  We went out looking for new suppliers because we were getting blocked everywhere and having issues getting the stuff we wanted, as you know, with supply chain breakdowns.
[01:31:44.975 --> 01:31:51.217]  We ran into two big companies that are listeners, and this particular company said, we have over 50 products, most of them are already top sellers.
[01:31:51.697 --> 01:31:53.318]  And I said, well, what do you think your best products are?
[01:31:53.338 --> 01:31:58.960]  They said, well, this is wide-spectrum CBD that we sell under a couple different names in stores and at medical clinics for about $120 to $150.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:31:59.901]  We recommend you sell it for $100.
[01:32:02.662 --> 01:32:07.541]   and we got to buy it for like 30 and I just said no we're gonna double our
[01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:12.802]   money's enough so yes this is $100 $120 question a thousand milligram one CBD
[01:32:12.802 --> 01:32:16.501]   for about half the price and so you you nailed it absolutely because I'm not a
[01:32:16.501 --> 01:32:19.942]   big top tester like you an expert I just go out and say what's top rated who's
[01:32:19.942 --> 01:32:22.942]   already got the best test who is that and then that way we know it's already
[01:32:22.942 --> 01:32:26.341]   built in that it's quality so thank you for the support it has to be processed
[01:32:26.341 --> 01:32:29.742]   correctly and whoever you're using as your source they know how to do that to
[01:32:29.742 --> 01:32:35.021]  maintain it so it keeps all those molecules in their form.
[01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:36.348]  CBDA is very delicate, and it can be destroyed through heat.
