[00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:21.195]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:24.237]  Let's talk truth!
[00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:26.878]  I'm talking today to somebody who I'm meeting for the first time.
[00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:29.160]  I met him a few minutes ago for the first time.
[00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:32.226]  I actually don't know a lot about him.
[00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:36.808]  The number one thing I know about him is that everybody has told me not to talk to him.
[00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:41.391]  Which is what made me want to actually sit down and talk to him.
[00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:47.034]  The United States of America were founded on free speech and open debate.
[00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:51.136]  It's in the First Amendment for a reason.
[00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.437]  And so, you know what?
[00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:58.460]  It's wrong that we've become a culture that wants to censor free speech and open debate.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.381]  And I think that part of the American way of life is we don't just embrace moderate ideals.
[00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:05.181]  That is an extreme idea.
[00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:09.982]  The idea that you get to speak your mind as long as I get to in return.
[00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:11.802]  That's a wild idea.
[00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:16.163]  For most of human history, it was done the other way.
[00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:18.264]  And that's what makes America great.
[00:01:18.264 --> 00:01:20.324]  That's what makes America itself.
[00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:25.225]  And so, if somebody tells me, don't listen to this person, my reaction is, you know what?
[00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:26.845]  I'm going to listen to him.
[00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:31.408]  I'm going to keep an open mind and hear what every person has to say because I'm a human being.
[00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:32.989]  Each of us as Americans is a human being.
[00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:39.793]  We can judge for ourselves what we believe the actual right way forward is for our country.
[00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:42.315]  So with that said, I've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time.
[00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:43.176]  I'm excited about it.
[00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:46.459]  Alex Jones, it's good to see you man.
[00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:56.450]  Vivek, thanks for doing this because when they censor you and deplatform you, they can then steal your identity and misrepresent what you've said and done and then build a straw man.
[00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.971]  Yeah.
[00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.292]  And that's why they fight so hard.
[00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:01.675]  99% of the things they say about me aren't true.
[00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:03.297]  They never show a clip.
[00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:05.299]  They just say I've done these things I haven't done.
[00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:15.488]  And it reminds me of them saying that Trump said after the thing that happened in Virginia, Charlottesville, that he said Hispanics are horrible criminals, bad people.
[00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:16.689]  He didn't say that.
[00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.453]  He said they're wonderful, good people, but they're also a lot of bad people coming across the border.
[00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:21.434]  They wouldn't show the clip.
[00:02:22.054 --> 00:02:38.643]  They would just say he said that, but he had a big enough bully pulpit to override that and so it doubled the number of Hispanics when he first got elected towards the end of his first term who understood that it was a lie and they then embraced him because of that.
[00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:43.586]  But that was because he could show them the actual clip and show them that there had been a lie.
[00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:44.867]  I'm not as big as Trump.
[00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:49.750]  I'm probably like 5% of the pull he's got and so I have been successfully in many ways
[00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.751]  Yes, it's interesting.
[00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:14.067]  I think that, I mean, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the fact that, you know, somebody came up, I don't know if it was someone from your team or someone who's part of your, you know, one of your followers or something, suggested it.
[00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:16.888]  And I said, OK, well, several people are saying, suggest, talk to this guy.
[00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:18.308]  Let's see if that's something we're open to.
[00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:21.470]  And then the reaction that I get is, no, no, no, this is a guy.
[00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.090]  You don't want to talk to it.
[00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.591]  It's going to be politically toxic for you.
[00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:25.351]  And my view is, no, no, no.
[00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:26.472]  We're the United States of America.
[00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.993]  So I have no idea if I'm going to agree with everything you're going to say or not.
[00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:30.954]  Well, here's your comeback, though.
[00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:31.834]  I'm curious about this.
[00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:32.735]  Here's your comeback.
[00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:40.218]  Lester Holt last week did a really important interview, or two weeks ago, with the Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran.
[00:03:40.218 --> 00:03:42.599]  Now, that guy is praising the attacks on Israel.
[00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.079]  It's terrible.
[00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.019]  I think he's a bad guy.
[00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.340]  Yeah, Khomeini's not a good guy.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.162]  It doesn't mean I want World War III with them either and Hezbollah, who's got sleeper cells in America on our open border.
[00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:57.686]  But that said, everybody doesn't attack Lester Holt interviewing the leader of Iran, the religious dictator.
[00:03:57.686 --> 00:04:07.531]  Okay, so you see Hamas publishing videos of kidnapping Israelis, killing Israelis, dead bodies, whole houses shot up with dead families.
[00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.052]  That's posted on Twitter.
[00:04:09.052 --> 00:04:10.773]  That's okay.
[00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:11.994]  I actually think that's...
[00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:15.636]  I mean, I guess free speech, as long as it has an advisory on it.
[00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:16.397]  The kids don't see it.
[00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:17.518]  Okay, it's horrible.
[00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:18.238]  First Amendment.
[00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:20.420]  I don't agree with it, but I understand it needs to be shown.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.341]  That's where I'm at.
[00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.762]  It's free speech and open debate.
[00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.003]  I haven't killed anybody.
[00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:41.816]  I'm not storming Israeli towns and murdering people en masse or coming on, you know, powered hang gliders slaughtering people, but they don't want this to be heard because when I see your message, and I'm not kissing your ass, it's just true, you are the most informed and the least to attack you, which is true.
[00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.533]  Geopolitically, you name it, compared to anybody I've ever basically interviewed.
[00:04:48.533 --> 00:05:02.899]  And Tucker Carlson is super smart, and I would say has more charisma, but he's a close second.
[00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.300]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:06.572]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.934]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.716]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:13.717]  The Great Awakening.
[00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:17.980]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second Great Renaissance.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.021]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:21.703]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:22.803]  We're good to go.
[00:05:41.522 --> 00:05:49.265]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:55.847]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:05:55.847 --> 00:05:57.068]  This is going to go to number one.
[00:05:57.068 --> 00:05:58.568]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:05:58.568 --> 00:05:59.609]  It's a powerful book.
[00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:00.149]  Get yours now.
[00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:12.898]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:28.044]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:31.305]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, October 24th, 2023.
[00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:37.208]  And across the planet, all the leading experts,
[00:06:38.146 --> 00:07:00.284]  Including the Pentagon, the Russian government, Elon Musk, Colonel McGregor, you name it, are saying the world is at the greatest danger of nuclear war and that we're already in World War III.
[00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:01.365]  World War III, watch DOD
[00:07:03.303 --> 00:07:09.805]  Reddy's plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Americans from the Middle East braces for worst case scenario.
[00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:14.746]  There's one of the headlines right there.
[00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:20.168]  Elon Musk warns we are sleepwalking our way into World War III.
[00:07:20.168 --> 00:07:22.828]  That's what I call it.
[00:07:22.828 --> 00:07:26.850]  Israel, a nuclear wild card on dangerous road to Armageddon.
[00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.230]  Colonel McGregor with Tucker Carlson.
[00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:38.804]  Meanwhile, video of pro-Palestinian mob in New York chants into the Fatah, and there's only one solution to the destruction of Israel, which leads to nuclear war.
[00:07:38.804 --> 00:07:41.606]  Hamas-style terror attack could occur in U.S.
[00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:45.349]  Former FBI National Counterterrorism official is warned.
[00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:49.673]  Hamas attack reveals a new terror strategy that could happen here.
[00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:53.796]  Intelligence shows Iran-backed militants are ready to ramp up their attacks against U.S.
[00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:54.837]  forces in the Middle East.
[00:07:57.662 --> 00:08:04.984]  Meanwhile, the FBI is now denying that their own memos show that their main target is Trump supporters and quote, white people.
[00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:19.329]  And we have more of that incredible footage in Minneapolis yesterday, where mobs of folks in masks waving Palestinian flags attacked anybody who was white in their vehicle screaming, get the white people.
[00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:22.470]  And a lot of them were white antifa saying that.
[00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.251]  Just absolutely incredible.
[00:08:25.976 --> 00:08:30.081]  So people say, are you on Israel's side or are you on the Muslim side?
[00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:39.974]  Well, the left and the Economist magazine owned by the Rothschilds and CNN, the rest of them, are for the Islamicists.
[00:08:39.974 --> 00:08:42.437]  Now that doesn't mean I support Israel flattening Gaza.
[00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:47.928]  And I've said that many, many times, but this is not a pick-a-side thing.
[00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:51.952]  This is understanding the globalists are orchestrating global destabilization.
[00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:56.916]  And I noticed a viral video on Twitter, a bunch of versions of it that I saw.
[00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:10.335]  Hundreds of thousands of views apiece with like a 14 second clip of me with Steve Manin on Saturday with Eric Prince, the founder and head of Blackwater and its new names.
[00:09:10.335 --> 00:09:15.398]  And they were hypothetically talking about what would happen if Israel fully goes in.
[00:09:15.398 --> 00:09:19.980]  Prince was saying it was a bad idea to go in.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.222]  The whole point of the segment was it's a trap and Israel shouldn't go in.
[00:09:24.212 --> 00:09:29.513]  And there was really no way for the Israelis to have massive losses and also not kill a lot of innocent people.
[00:09:29.513 --> 00:09:30.894]  And I said, I'm against this war.
[00:09:30.894 --> 00:09:32.714]  I think it's a trap.
[00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:47.037]  But then I said the only way for them to do it is to drop heavy bombs and destroy the tunnels and send in their first waves of troops, knowing that Hezbollah, Hamas, same thing, is going to pop up behind them like they did in Lebanon in 2006, 2007, and Israel got its ass kicked.
[00:09:49.963 --> 00:09:57.765]  So we were wargaming the scenarios, and what do the foaming at the mouth, anti-deceptive Israel lobby do?
[00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.766]  Again, I'm not with the Israel lobby.
[00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.386]  Critical of much of what goes on in Israel.
[00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:02.907]  But no, it's not one monolith.
[00:10:02.907 --> 00:10:05.547]  It's a bunch of political parties like us.
[00:10:05.547 --> 00:10:08.368]  Their criticism doesn't hurt me.
[00:10:08.368 --> 00:10:10.969]  I actually welcome it and like it.
[00:10:10.969 --> 00:10:14.330]  But I just never get over the pure deception
[00:10:15.862 --> 00:10:16.323]  I don't know.
[00:10:28.848 --> 00:10:29.968]  In fact, I meant to send it to you guys.
[00:10:29.968 --> 00:10:31.889]  It's only like 14 seconds long.
[00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:33.990]  So during the break, I'll give it to you.
[00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:44.995]  And it's me talking about the hypothetical of how if Israel does go in, they'll probably go in, because I've been reading what the militaries of the world are saying is the only feasible plan if they do.
[00:10:44.995 --> 00:10:46.115]  But we said, don't do it.
[00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:53.658]  It's a trap with the Hezbollah, Iranian, Persians, and the Chaikoms.
[00:10:53.658 --> 00:10:55.559]  That was the whole point was, it's a trap.
[00:10:57.216 --> 00:11:04.866]  And I was talking about the only way to do it where they would not sustain the just incredible levels of casualties.
[00:11:04.866 --> 00:11:10.974]  And again, people take a 14 second clip out of context and say, Jones wants to blow up Gaza.
[00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:14.028]  Oh, they grabbed the clip.
[00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:16.029]  So here's the clip out of context.
[00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:21.153]  And of course, if you want to go watch the Steve Bannon interview, it was like an hour long show.
[00:11:21.153 --> 00:11:22.834]  It's been posted on Infowars.com.
[00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:23.735]  You can go watch it.
[00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:24.456]  It's a trap.
[00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:26.017]  Israel shouldn't go in.
[00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:26.737]  It's bad.
[00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:28.899]  We feel for all the sides.
[00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:32.321]  Eric Prince says, yeah, you don't want to just lay it all out rubble.
[00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:38.066]  And then that turns into, because you see Alex Jones and Steve Bannon, and we've got to be
[00:11:39.244 --> 00:11:42.105]  You know, coddling Israel.
[00:11:42.105 --> 00:12:03.511]  And Bannon is a supporter of Israel, and I believe Israel has a right to survive, and I'm not an enemy of Israel, but the minority of the right wing that is Israel-obsessed never talks about the open borders and all the Islamists being brought in, and how the left's backing them because that's their real takeover plan.
[00:12:04.656 --> 00:12:09.737]  And what's going on in Israel is more academic when you look at the larger picture.
[00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:13.578]  So I'm trying to have a real adult discussion here.
[00:12:13.578 --> 00:12:19.219]  And Nick Fuentes is here tomorrow to quote debate this, but I said I'll debate him on these issues.
[00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:25.060]  The premise of the issue is not who's right or who's wrong in my debate lexicon.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.221]  It's the big picture here.
[00:12:29.136 --> 00:12:38.981]  Israel's not going anywhere with those nuclear weapons, so if all the Arab states attack them and start overrunning them, we're going to be in a nuclear war, and I really don't want that, but here's a clip out of context.
[00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:47.225]  Moab carpet bombing in lanes, and basically just destroy it inch by inch, driving down 200 feet, taking out those tunnels.
[00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:51.387]  They just have to simply make everybody evacuate, and then level at least northern Gaza.
[00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:52.108]  That's the only way to do this.
[00:12:53.777 --> 00:12:55.878]  And again, why did you get a longer clip?
[00:12:55.878 --> 00:13:02.761]  Because we're saying don't go in, it's a trap, but this is the best option if Israel does it, and that's a humanitarian disaster.
[00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:07.863]  But you're not given that because these people are deceiving you.
[00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:11.805]  And that's what they do.
[00:13:11.805 --> 00:13:20.929]  And the corporate media does it, the left does it worse than any other group, and then the people that just literally
[00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:22.809]  We're good to go.
[00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:44.954]  Over the New World Order system that's trying to sterilize us all, trying to give us all poison shots.
[00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:52.697]  I want to unify us against the globalist destruction of human industrial society, which is their admitted plan.
[00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:55.618]  That doesn't mean, though, I'm all kumbaya, open the borders up.
[00:13:56.178 --> 00:14:09.924]  Where the globalists use our openness to bring in tens of millions of incompatible military-age men, Muslims, so they can then run around in New York and Minnesota and everywhere else, blocking roads and breaking windows out and trying to pull white people out of their cars.
[00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:11.004]  Because look!
[00:14:11.004 --> 00:14:11.925]  It's a white guy!
[00:14:11.925 --> 00:14:13.385]  Get him!
[00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.266]  Roll some of that B-roll.
[00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:16.286]  I mean, we've got a bunch of this.
[00:14:16.286 --> 00:14:17.347]  We've got the overhead shots.
[00:14:17.347 --> 00:14:18.087]  We've got the audio.
[00:14:18.087 --> 00:14:19.748]  There's so much cussing, it's hard to play.
[00:14:23.132 --> 00:14:27.673]  I mean, just imagine this, and we've got the overhead shots.
[00:14:27.673 --> 00:14:39.037]  So, when I talk about having a debate with Nick tomorrow, which everybody's shooting for, I'm just going to sit here and let him make his points about Israel all day.
[00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:40.057]  That's great.
[00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:41.237]  It's good for debate.
[00:14:41.237 --> 00:14:42.698]  Good to have open discussion.
[00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.438]  And I'm just going to keep bringing up, what do we do about this?
[00:14:44.438 --> 00:14:46.239]  What do we do about this?
[00:14:47.267 --> 00:14:54.910]  Because they've tied supporting these people to not supporting Israel, and that's the cool, trendy thing to do on the left and right to hate Israel.
[00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:00.812]  So then the byproduct is, okay, let's let more Muslims in and let them do this?
[00:15:00.812 --> 00:15:09.635]  And you don't see AOC or any of the squad, Tlaib and Omar, decrying this.
[00:15:09.635 --> 00:15:12.476]  In fact, they're saying it's a good fact.
[00:15:12.476 --> 00:15:14.797]  When we come back from break, the press secretary,
[00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:20.026]  Was asked about all the attacks on Jews.
[00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:22.647]  Stabbing, shootings, bombings, the rest of it.
[00:15:22.647 --> 00:15:35.891]  And she said, oh no, the Muslims are downtrodden little sweet babies, so... So it is, just like transgenderism, it is now the holy cow, the sacred cow, to not do this.
[00:15:35.891 --> 00:15:42.113]  And I'm just like, no, I will not be put in your paradigm if I choose either one of these sides.
[00:15:42.113 --> 00:15:42.833]  And if there were...
[00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:47.290]  People from Israel do the same thing here, I would be obviously against that.
[00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:54.696]  So I'm going to keep focusing on the open borders, the inflation, the fentanyl, the pedophilia, the New World Order, and defeating it.
[00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:56.177]  The poison shots, all of it.
[00:15:56.177 --> 00:15:58.099]  Not just focusing on Israel all day long.
[00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:03.573]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:16:03.573 --> 00:16:07.135]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:12.237]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.678]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:23.282]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.603]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:16:25.123 --> 00:16:29.488]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:33.292]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:36.156]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:05.599]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4 Store at M4's Life not at a probiotic for more than 3 years?
[00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:06.820]  The answer is simple.

[00:19:09.741 --> 00:19:14.242]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than 7 years.
[00:19:14.242 --> 00:19:19.304]  They got bought by a lip tart company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[00:19:20.064 --> 00:19:25.568]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[00:20:06.209 --> 00:20:07.514]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:17.242 --> 00:20:20.843]  And we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[00:20:20.843 --> 00:20:24.323]  Vivek Ramaswamy was here about a week and a half ago.
[00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.024]  And we did an hour plus great interview.
[00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.944]  He interviewed me.
[00:20:27.944 --> 00:20:29.885]  And that interview is posted on Infowars.com.
[00:20:29.885 --> 00:20:32.125]  We'll play a few excerpts today.
[00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:34.346]  And he asked me to air it.
[00:20:34.346 --> 00:20:35.506]  And I want to.
[00:20:35.506 --> 00:20:41.247]  But I'm going to have the crew add a bunch of documents and videos and clips.
[00:20:41.247 --> 00:20:43.627]  Make it kind of a documentary.
[00:20:43.627 --> 00:20:45.548]  So we're going to air the whole thing either
[00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:50.120]  Thursday or Friday.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.401]  Little documentary form of it.
[00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:52.442]  It was a really good interview.
[00:20:52.442 --> 00:20:55.123]  And I think he's a really smart guy.
[00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:56.044]  So look for that.
[00:20:56.044 --> 00:21:01.066]  There's a bunch of other big interviews that are in the can, where I'm interviewed by other people.
[00:21:01.066 --> 00:21:04.228]  And that'll be out very, very soon.
[00:21:04.228 --> 00:21:05.329]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:06.630]  Several big ones.
[00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.670]  Well, not about as big.
[00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.211]  As big as you can get.
[00:21:09.211 --> 00:21:11.372]  So there's a lot of interesting things going on.
[00:21:11.372 --> 00:21:12.353]  We're working very, very hard.
[00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:19.361]  And sometimes when I miss part of a show or the show, it's because I'm busy keeping this operation going.
[00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:28.965]  So I want to get into the nuclear war issue and why it's so serious and the chain of events that can lead to it very, very quickly and why almost every top expert agrees.
[00:21:28.965 --> 00:21:30.506]  But I haven't found any that disagree.
[00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:34.168]  We're the closest nuclear war we've ever been.
[00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:35.708]  But let me just early in the broadcast.
[00:21:38.012 --> 00:21:48.403]  Again, just clarify some things about the state of Infowars and this very important transmission that you have patronized and that you've kept on air, and I've been very, very thankful for that.
[00:21:48.403 --> 00:21:57.672]  You saw literally hundreds of articles, and they were syndicated, many of them, so thousands of newspapers, local stations, everything.
[00:21:57.672 --> 00:21:59.854]  Alex Jones loses his bankruptcy case last week.
[00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:01.458]  That's not true.
[00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:13.059]  It was a minor matter of, as our appeals go forward, would the federal judge just say that those debts were basically dischargeable?
[00:22:14.102 --> 00:22:14.342]  I don't
[00:22:44.402 --> 00:22:49.323]  I know the big leagues I'm in and that's the choice I made many years ago and I've talked a lot about it.
[00:22:49.323 --> 00:22:56.705]  So they just keep turning up the heat thinking there's some point I break and there isn't a point.
[00:22:56.705 --> 00:23:02.286]  I'm already on a kamikaze mission here and I'll never commit suicide and my family's 100% behind me.
[00:23:02.286 --> 00:23:07.567]  We've never been closer together and they've been persecuted as well and we're just ready for it.
[00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:08.227]  That said,
[00:23:11.016 --> 00:23:26.920]  It's your decision whether to basically, after the horse has been working all day on the coal mine, hauling up big sleds of coal to fire the furnaces of liberty, whether you want to feed the horse and give the horse water.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.840]  Because I'm very resigned.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.381]  I work harder than I've ever worked, and I don't subconsciously give up.
[00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:39.455]  I'll never give up, never sell out, but I could give out and really that's you.
[00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:43.799]  You're the point of giving out and you're not giving out.
[00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:46.762]  I'm saying you're the link that they want to give out.
[00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.431]  That's why they run all the fake headlines.
[00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:52.812]  They have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:23:52.812 --> 00:23:53.753]  Now they don't say that.
[00:23:53.753 --> 00:23:59.337]  Now they admit I don't have anything, basically, other than my house and stuff.
[00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:04.001]  And they get up on the courthouse steps on national TV and say, don't give him money.
[00:24:04.001 --> 00:24:05.242]  He's going down.
[00:24:05.242 --> 00:24:06.283]  He's going to be off air.
[00:24:06.283 --> 00:24:08.985]  We've been hearing that for over a year and a half.
[00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:10.786]  Notice we're still on air.
[00:24:11.627 --> 00:24:14.249]  But that's to give you the perception I've been defeated.
[00:24:14.249 --> 00:24:19.732]  My family gets flooded with phone calls and, oh, we're so sorry to hear that, you know, you guys are shutting down.
[00:24:19.732 --> 00:24:22.434]  We're so sad to hear about what happened to Alex.
[00:24:22.434 --> 00:24:26.957]  And again, that's a mind control trick.
[00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:29.539]  That's a mind control game.
[00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:40.126]  Without spending a long time on this, because you have big fish to fry here that affect you and your family and the economy and cultural developments that are just so incredibly important, we're going to be getting to coming up throughout the broadcast today.
[00:24:41.348 --> 00:24:41.948]  I don't think so.
[00:25:02.697 --> 00:25:22.202]  He's 100% a journalist, he was there legally on the grounds, he tried to stop people going in, and the judge said in the charging order, and then again in the sentencing order, that you are still saying the election was stolen, you're not sorry for what you did, so I'm putting you in prison.
[00:25:22.202 --> 00:25:30.664]  That sets an incredible precedent, that's why that's a big deal, but you've seen them charge Trump for saying the election was stolen, which is totally true, but
[00:25:31.775 --> 00:25:33.796]  Even if it was wrong, he has that First Amendment right.
[00:25:33.796 --> 00:25:36.518]  So that's where we are.
[00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:38.119]  Brutal intimidation.
[00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:40.541]  Brutal attempt to take over the country.
[00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:44.443]  And if America rolls over, things are going to be a lot worse for everybody.
[00:25:44.443 --> 00:25:46.864]  So the only course is standing up.
[00:25:46.864 --> 00:25:47.585]  So it's very simple.
[00:25:51.093 --> 00:26:06.366]  I didn't know that listeners would buy the propaganda when we declared bankruptcy over a year ago, and we saw revenue go down massively, and then I sold everything I had, and we got a big donation to keep us on air that we didn't know we'd get, or we'd have been gone.
[00:26:06.366 --> 00:26:15.274]  Because people believe, even though I said it's not true, this is a chapter 11, subchapter 5, people believe the New York Times that we were going to be shut down within weeks.
[00:26:15.274 --> 00:26:17.496]  And people said, hey, I'm not going to order anything, you're not going to be there.
[00:26:18.772 --> 00:26:22.953]  Now over the last year plus, people have come back and they've gone, oh, okay.
[00:26:22.953 --> 00:26:26.574]  But that's what they do.
[00:26:26.574 --> 00:26:28.894]  So it's very, very simple.
[00:26:28.894 --> 00:26:35.516]  We have limited edition Trump political prisoner shirts with the actual mugshot photo at InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:26:35.516 --> 00:26:37.476]  Get them, support the broadcast, spread the word.
[00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:40.917]  We have my new book, The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[00:26:42.318 --> 00:26:43.858]  It's twice the length of the last book.
[00:26:43.858 --> 00:26:44.479]  It's incredible.
[00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:46.059]  This is really a historic book.
[00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:46.839]  The other book was great.
[00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:48.299]  It was The Death Star Plans.
[00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:53.521]  This is How to Defeat the Empire and How to Launch a New Civilization.
[00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.281]  It's really an important book.
[00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.361]  You can get a signed copy.
[00:26:56.361 --> 00:26:57.542]  That's a fundraiser.
[00:26:57.542 --> 00:26:58.102]  Keep us on air.
[00:26:58.102 --> 00:26:59.142]  I want to thank those that have.
[00:26:59.142 --> 00:27:02.463]  Those that don't have the money to get a signed copy, get a regular copy.
[00:27:02.463 --> 00:27:09.844]  That's the regular price at m4s4.com or get it on Amazon.com if you want to send it to number one like you did last time.
[00:27:09.844 --> 00:27:11.305]  And you can get great supplements.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.805]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is selling out, so good for your body, so good for your immune system, especially going into the winter, you need it.
[00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:20.747]  It's discounted, selling out at FullWarStore.com.
[00:27:20.747 --> 00:27:25.551]  We have that sale, we've extended because they told me why they're not having new sales.
[00:27:25.551 --> 00:27:28.274]  They're updating the shopping cart tomorrow in the middle of the night.
[00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:35.280]  They don't want to add new stuff to it, but this is your last chance to... And let me just tell the crew something.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.503]  The shirts came in a few weeks ago, and
[00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:45.373]  We always show the other collector's edition shirt that's not the actual mugshot.
[00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:53.299]  And the actual one with the mugshot is a really cool orange and gold shirt that really stands out.
[00:27:53.299 --> 00:27:57.162]  So whether we do this live on air right now or later in post, there it is.
[00:27:57.162 --> 00:28:00.584]  That's the actual mugshot shirt and that's actually it.
[00:28:02.112 --> 00:28:04.913]  Those are limited edition at InfoWarsRaw.com.
[00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:15.295]  We have the InfoWars Platinum that are just three private labels of already best-selling products that were gotten from a top manufacturer in the country that are already super reviewed and work super well.
[00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:19.736]  HH Max Boost, 7076 testosterone boost, PainMD is incredible as well.
[00:28:19.736 --> 00:28:21.136]  Those are discounted.
[00:28:21.136 --> 00:28:31.198]  And it really is the last few days, because there will be new sales on Thursday, of the DNA Force Plus, Real Red Pill Plus, and Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:37.146]  And of course, 60% off for Brain Force plus the amazing Nootropic.
[00:28:37.146 --> 00:28:39.567]  So, that's how you keep us on air.
[00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:41.929]  Free speech needs the funds.
[00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:47.092]  When you buy the book, I actually get some of the funds for myself to pay my bills.
[00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:48.433]  And it's that simple.
[00:28:48.433 --> 00:28:52.235]  So, if you decide to keep us on air, we'll be here in a year, we'll be here in two years.
[00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:54.276]  If you don't, you're pulling the plug on the operation.
[00:28:54.276 --> 00:28:54.937]  That's your decision.
[00:28:54.937 --> 00:28:56.237]  I respect that.
[00:28:56.237 --> 00:28:57.078]  But I'm not giving up.
[00:28:57.078 --> 00:28:58.559]  So please, keep me in the fight.
[00:28:59.636 --> 00:29:04.157]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:29:04.157 --> 00:29:09.338]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:29:09.338 --> 00:29:12.799]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:13.859]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:18.340]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:24.201]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:31.945]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:29:31.945 --> 00:29:35.587]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[00:29:35.587 --> 00:29:40.150]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.690]  We're good.
[00:29:59.304 --> 00:30:07.549]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:08.930]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.871]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:13.092]  These products are incredible.
[00:30:13.092 --> 00:30:16.854]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:30:16.854 --> 00:30:27.461]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[00:30:28.575 --> 00:30:31.036]  We've got 3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:36.519]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:40.421]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:43.803]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD.
[00:30:43.803 --> 00:30:47.965]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:30:47.965 --> 00:30:54.549]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:30:59.184 --> 00:31:00.585]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:31:00.585 --> 00:31:01.526]  I thought it was next week.
[00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:05.950]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.192]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:31:08.192 --> 00:31:10.433]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:31:10.433 --> 00:31:13.916]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:18.080]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.042]  Right to the top, folks.
[00:31:21.042 --> 00:31:23.624]  Right to the top with these 95% Cucuminoids.
[00:31:26.883 --> 00:31:31.068]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10%.
[00:31:31.068 --> 00:31:33.771]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:31:33.771 --> 00:31:37.695]  This is 95%.
[00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:38.657]  Super constant.
[00:31:38.657 --> 00:31:42.541]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:44.023]  It's that powerful.
[00:31:44.023 --> 00:31:45.184]  Or more.
[00:31:45.184 --> 00:31:47.306]  So they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:55.287]  The Infowars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned to celebrate this powerful product's long-awaited homecoming.

[00:33:01.524 --> 00:33:07.427]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.161]  Fighting the good fight in the Info War.
[00:33:18.161 --> 00:33:25.706]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:25.706 --> 00:33:28.987]  Get your motor running.
[00:33:28.987 --> 00:33:30.568]  Head out on the highway.
[00:33:30.568 --> 00:33:35.191]  Looking for adventure.
[00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:36.852]  In whatever comes our way.
[00:33:39.578 --> 00:33:41.099]  Let me finish what I was saying last segment.
[00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:43.681]  We're in a war against the most powerful forces the world's ever seen.
[00:33:43.681 --> 00:33:46.262]  But what they're pushing and selling and doing is incredibly evil.
[00:33:46.262 --> 00:33:47.323]  And it's horribly unpopular.
[00:34:08.326 --> 00:34:19.634]  And if you simply support the men and women, like myself, that are on the very front lines of this fight and back us with your word of mouth, your prayers, and financially, we will win.
[00:34:19.634 --> 00:34:21.576]  But if you don't realize, this is for all the marbles.
[00:34:21.576 --> 00:34:23.037]  This is the big deal.
[00:34:23.037 --> 00:34:24.858]  The big kahuna.
[00:34:24.858 --> 00:34:28.120]  I mean, look how Trump had no major wars of any type.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.422]  I was getting peace stills everywhere for four years.
[00:34:30.422 --> 00:34:33.724]  You get Biden in, it's like flipping a light switch on open borders.
[00:34:34.825 --> 00:34:42.568]  On fentanyl deaths, on inflation, on wars, because the globalists are really bad hombres.
[00:34:42.568 --> 00:34:45.409]  They're very evil, ruthless people.
[00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.870]  They want global conquest.
[00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.891]  There's a good news example.
[00:34:49.891 --> 00:34:53.973]  And if I tried to list, every time I start thinking about in just the last year,
[00:34:55.163 --> 00:35:03.990]  All of the populist anti-globalists that are getting elected and taking over governments and parliaments and prime ministerships and presidencies, it makes the head spin.
[00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.212]  Here's a new one today.
[00:35:06.212 --> 00:35:12.317]  And again, the way parliaments work is not all seats are up, kind of like the House of Representatives at the same time.
[00:35:12.317 --> 00:35:16.941]  So in the last two elections, anti-globalist, anti-New World Order,
[00:35:18.365 --> 00:35:25.028]  Individuals have won almost all the seats, and when there's another election, they'll basically have them all in a supermajority.
[00:35:25.028 --> 00:35:28.469]  Here's a headline, Zero Hedge, up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:28.469 --> 00:35:45.297]  Switzerland's right-wing surge, SVPs, electoral triumph reflects concerns over immigration, globalism, and the same thing's happening in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, the UK, Canada, Argentina, Brazil,
[00:35:46.681 --> 00:35:48.162]  The list goes on and on.
[00:35:48.162 --> 00:35:52.586]  So people ask me, are we winning?
[00:35:52.586 --> 00:35:54.848]  We're definitely winning hearts and minds.
[00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:57.810]  And the globalists are the most unpopular that they've ever been.
[00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:05.517]  And their operations, whether they're ESGs or poison injections, have never been more unpopular.
[00:36:05.517 --> 00:36:08.119]  They've been pushing their new, quote, COVID booster for months.
[00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.960]  2% have taken it.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.281]  67% took it last time.
[00:36:13.787 --> 00:36:16.009]  And so, yeah, we're winning hearts and minds.
[00:36:16.009 --> 00:36:18.991]  Are we winning overall?
[00:36:18.991 --> 00:36:20.633]  No, because the enemy is so far ahead of us.
[00:36:20.633 --> 00:36:27.358]  But you can roll over and decide we're going to totally lose, and then we will lose, and there's no limit to which these tyrants will take us.
[00:36:27.358 --> 00:36:30.420]  So, it's so simple.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:37.386]  You've got to really get your game face on and decide to promote the media outlets that tell the truth, because you have the power.
[00:36:37.386 --> 00:36:38.687]  Without you, we're nothing.
[00:36:38.687 --> 00:36:39.768]  You are everything.
[00:36:39.768 --> 00:36:41.529]  And you've got to decide to financially support.
[00:36:41.529 --> 00:36:42.490]  You've got to decide to pray.
[00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:45.826]  And that's it.
[00:36:45.826 --> 00:36:50.829]  And nobody has been more attacked than Trump and myself and people like Julian Assange.
[00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:53.291]  And there's other good news on that front.
[00:36:53.291 --> 00:37:06.921]  Bipartisan groups in Congress, I'll get to that a little bit later, have issued bipartisan call for Biden to drop Julian Assange's case and get him released from solitary confinement where they're slowly killing him.
[00:37:06.921 --> 00:37:09.223]  So we can say, oh, they'll never do it.
[00:37:09.223 --> 00:37:10.784]  Well, if we never push, they never will.
[00:37:11.837 --> 00:37:17.902]  That's one of the big black eyes that Trump has, in my view, is that he didn't get that done, but the CIA threatened him on it.
[00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:20.784]  So that's where we are.
[00:37:20.784 --> 00:37:40.240]  But when you look at Kirby up there as the twin spokesperson of the White House every day, admitting that our weapons are depleted, admitting there's more threats than ever, admitting that World War III has never been closer, then they ask the other press secretary about, oh, hey, what about attacks on Jews?
[00:37:42.113 --> 00:37:46.998]  And she responds by saying, no one's more downtrodden than the Palestinians.
[00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:50.442]  Now again, this is not about a debate whether you're for Israel or the Palestinians.
[00:37:50.442 --> 00:38:00.312]  It's about a discussion of the White House gave $6 billion a month before this attack to Iran, who gave it to Hamas.
[00:38:00.312 --> 00:38:01.414]  Why are they doing that?
[00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:05.886]  Why is the Economist, owned by the Rothschilds, supporting the Palestinians?
[00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:13.652]  Why are the universities in Harvard and the left, and the Democratic Party, in their real action, sending hundreds of millions more to the Palestinians?
[00:38:13.652 --> 00:38:16.194]  Because there's a larger operation here.
[00:38:16.194 --> 00:38:18.515]  Why are they letting them flood over our border here?
[00:38:18.515 --> 00:38:23.279]  And then saying, don't worry, we'll take your rights, when they terror attack us.
[00:38:23.279 --> 00:38:26.161]  And going and supporting Israel doesn't stop this.
[00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:27.242]  That's not even part of the debate.
[00:38:29.713 --> 00:38:37.397]  A lot of the right wing in this country actually supporting Islam right now because they hate Israel so much and I'm saying that's mental illness.
[00:38:37.397 --> 00:38:42.800]  You can have a dart board with Benjamin Netanyahu's face on it and throw darts at it in your garage all day long.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.541]  Knock yourself out.
[00:38:44.541 --> 00:38:46.563]  That's not part of my discussion.
[00:38:46.563 --> 00:38:48.844]  I want Islamists to support it.
[00:38:48.844 --> 00:38:50.225]  I want the border controlled.
[00:38:50.225 --> 00:38:54.127]  That's what I'm focused on as our country.
[00:38:54.127 --> 00:38:55.908]  And to see people taking sides
[00:38:57.128 --> 00:39:11.564]  For the Islamists and everything they're doing in the name of getting Israel is mindless because it doesn't do anything to support Israel or to support yourself when you sit there and support the Islamists.
[00:39:11.564 --> 00:39:16.629]  You don't have to support Israel and then at the same time
[00:39:17.972 --> 00:39:19.293]  Support an open border.
[00:39:19.293 --> 00:39:23.197]  And you don't have to even support Islam and then want an open border.
[00:39:23.197 --> 00:39:24.819]  It's two separate things.
[00:39:24.819 --> 00:39:29.924]  And I look at politics and how people are so mindless.
[00:39:29.924 --> 00:39:32.147]  If you hate Israel, that's your prerogative.
[00:39:32.147 --> 00:39:38.133]  But why do you then say, yeah, I'm not going to criticize the open borders or the Islamic invasion?
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:40:08.704]  So, World War 3 Watch, DoD readies plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Americans from the Middle East, braces for worst case scenario, Elon Musk, we'll play the clip in a moment, warns we are sleepwalking into World War 3, that's my exact quote, Colonel McGregor, Israel, a nuclear war on dangerous road to Armageddon, pro-Palestinian mob in New York City chants Intifada, there is only one solution, the destruction of Israel, and that means nuclear war.
[00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.811]  And now they say brace for terror attacks.
[00:40:11.811 --> 00:40:14.251]  And hell, the globalists may stage it themselves.
[00:40:14.251 --> 00:40:15.712]  The Islamists might not even do it.
[00:40:15.712 --> 00:40:26.514]  The point is they have the cover now to give you the false flags, start major wars, expand the wars that are already started, and suspend the election that's only 12 months away.
[00:40:26.514 --> 00:40:28.815]  We are in a crisis.
[00:40:28.815 --> 00:40:36.657]  So here's Kirby, who will not rule out war with Iran, and then we'll just go straight through to the clip of the press secretary and what I mentioned earlier.
[00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:38.838]  So is a U.S.
[00:40:38.838 --> 00:40:41.631]  war against Iran possible?
[00:40:43.439 --> 00:40:49.281]  I think what we want to see more than anything, Wolf, is no widening of this conflict.
[00:40:49.281 --> 00:40:50.721]  No deepening of it.
[00:40:50.721 --> 00:41:00.924]  And we continue to send a strong message to actors in the region, including Iran, that if you're thinking about jumping in here, you're thinking about deepening and widening and escalating, don't do it.
[00:41:00.924 --> 00:41:08.846]  We will take our national security interests very, very seriously in the region, and we've added to the military capabilities to make sure that we can do that.
[00:41:16.967 --> 00:41:18.548]  So a couple of things.
[00:41:18.548 --> 00:41:23.931]  Look, we have not seen any credible threats.
[00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:27.412]  I know there's been always questions about credible threats.
[00:41:27.412 --> 00:41:30.174]  And so I just want to make sure that that's out there.
[00:41:30.174 --> 00:41:35.076]  But look, Muslim and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate
[00:41:35.515 --> 00:41:37.917]  A number of hate-fueled attacks.
[00:41:37.917 --> 00:41:48.186]  And certainly President Biden understands that many of our Muslim Arab Americans and Palestinian American loved ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities.
[00:41:48.186 --> 00:41:54.751]  And that is something you heard the president speak to in his address just last Thursday.
[00:41:54.751 --> 00:42:01.217]  And so one of the things that the president has done is directed his team, Homeland Security team, to prioritize prevention.
[00:42:01.713 --> 00:42:03.275]  I can't listen to any more of this.
[00:42:25.555 --> 00:42:28.256]  So you heard, we haven't seen any attacks on Jews.
[00:42:28.256 --> 00:42:29.177]  Okay, alright.
[00:42:29.177 --> 00:42:33.219]  And then what would you see in Israel on the 7th of October?
[00:42:33.219 --> 00:42:36.480]  And then you've got, again, scenes like this all over the country if you're a TV viewer.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:46.485]  Mobs of Islamists and their anti-Muslim supporters attacking anybody in their cars that's white and bashing their windows out and dragging them out of their vehicles.
[00:42:46.485 --> 00:42:48.946]  Because they're white, they deserve it!
[00:42:48.946 --> 00:42:54.389]  And that's why the left is chanting, death to Israel now, because they're white people, at least that's how they see them.
[00:42:55.202 --> 00:42:56.663]  And that's all thanks to the ADL.
[00:42:56.663 --> 00:42:57.383]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:57.383 --> 00:43:01.804]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.804 --> 00:43:04.065]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:43:04.065 --> 00:43:05.486]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:43:05.486 --> 00:43:07.846]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:43:07.846 --> 00:43:11.628]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:43:11.628 --> 00:43:12.608]  The Great Awakening.
[00:43:12.608 --> 00:43:16.869]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:43:16.869 --> 00:43:18.930]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.611]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:43:21.271 --> 00:43:21.751]  We're good to go.
[00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:48.172]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:43:48.172 --> 00:43:54.754]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:43:54.754 --> 00:43:56.254]  This is going to go to number one.

[00:43:57.474 --> 00:43:58.515]  It's a powerful book.
[00:43:58.515 --> 00:43:59.055]  Get yours now.
[00:43:59.855 --> 00:44:06.620]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:10.263]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented, amazing.
[00:44:10.263 --> 00:44:19.770]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:20.951]  It's about to sell out.
[00:44:20.951 --> 00:44:22.452]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[00:44:22.452 --> 00:44:24.374]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[00:45:14.008 --> 00:45:21.930]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:30.335]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.

[00:46:07.804 --> 00:46:13.187]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:20.832]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[00:46:21.032 --> 00:46:32.041]  Turmeric bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:43.791]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[00:46:44.031 --> 00:46:47.513]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[00:46:47.513 --> 00:46:51.376]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[00:46:51.376 --> 00:47:01.902]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at InfoWareStore.com and put your body at ease.
[00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:07.806]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:21.804 --> 00:47:28.396]  Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the top five video games in the world for three years running.
[00:47:31.457 --> 00:47:36.020]  And I was told by the folks when they were producing it back at the time that they were going to have a Prophet character based on me.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.122]  It's not about bragging.
[00:47:38.122 --> 00:47:41.344]  They got the new Spider-Man character based on me.
[00:47:41.344 --> 00:47:44.206]  It's the newspaper editor and owner.
[00:47:44.206 --> 00:47:50.110]  They've got, you know, countless basically villains or weirdos based on Alex Jones.
[00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.452]  And I talked about it a few days ago.
[00:47:52.452 --> 00:47:57.055]  And then it went viral on Twitter with a guy that made the mod thinking I was saying he's part of the New World Order.
[00:47:57.616 --> 00:47:59.621]  I'm not saying the makers of the game are part of the New World Order.
[00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:00.904]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:48:00.904 --> 00:48:04.453]  I think games like this are good that we've inspired, in part.
[00:48:05.393 --> 00:48:09.957]  I know others have aspired as well to educate people about the globalist agenda.
[00:48:09.957 --> 00:48:11.879]  So that was the headline.
[00:48:11.879 --> 00:48:13.000]  Laughed my ass off.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.827]  Alex Jones noticed it and now he thinks I'm in the cabal, said Night Docs.
[00:48:19.827 --> 00:48:21.749]  And no, that's not what I'm saying.
[00:48:21.749 --> 00:48:26.733]  So since I didn't play that the other day and it's gone viral, here's the clip.
[00:48:26.733 --> 00:48:29.976]  Folks, I'm coming to you live today from Night City.
[00:48:31.284 --> 00:48:38.007]  And I just gotta talk a second about these ghoulish leaders over at the Arasaka Corporation.
[00:48:38.007 --> 00:48:43.670]  Ugh, just the sound of that makes my stomach churn.
[00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.632]  So ladies and gentlemen, I've uncovered the truth.
[00:48:46.632 --> 00:48:55.256]  Arasaka, they're not just content with swiping souls and encoding them in those digital prisons that we've been hearing so much about.
[00:48:56.118 --> 00:48:56.978]  No!
[00:48:56.978 --> 00:49:00.780]  Now they're out here stealing our voices!
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.240]  My voice!
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.641]  Your voice!
[00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:05.661]  I just heard it myself!
[00:49:05.661 --> 00:49:06.902]  My voice!
[00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:08.182]  My passion!
[00:49:08.182 --> 00:49:12.124]  Coming out of some digital puppet inside the net!
[00:49:12.124 --> 00:49:16.505]  They're trying to silence the real truth tellers by stealing our identity!
[00:49:16.505 --> 00:49:17.886]  Stealing our souls!
[00:49:19.046 --> 00:49:22.608]  Arasaka, they want total control, people.
[00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:25.890]  They're not just gonna stop with just your voices or your souls.
[00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.192]  They're gonna own you outright.
[00:49:28.192 --> 00:49:29.933]  They want to be us.
[00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:31.834]  To replace us.
[00:49:31.834 --> 00:49:35.296]  Don't let them get away with it!
[00:49:35.296 --> 00:49:39.379]  Do not install the new voice mod for Cyberpunk 2077.
[00:49:39.379 --> 00:49:46.003]  So, obviously that's tongue-in-cheek there because it is stealing my voice.
[00:49:46.003 --> 00:49:47.984]  It is impersonating me.
[00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:48.184]  But...
[00:49:49.833 --> 00:49:55.496]  The character, one of the main characters, is based on me, so that's actually art imitating life.
[00:49:55.496 --> 00:49:56.737]  So it's come full circle.
[00:49:56.737 --> 00:50:07.642]  It's an attempt to steal my identity in a fun way, but you can't steal something that you already imitated.
[00:50:07.642 --> 00:50:11.004]  You understand the whole basis of the game is as a global government, global corporation.
[00:50:11.749 --> 00:50:13.390]  That wants to download your souls.
[00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.050]  It's lying.
[00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.291]  It's really not your soul.
[00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:16.932]  It's a facsimile of you.
[00:50:16.932 --> 00:50:20.414]  And there's a biochip that lets you live forever that the globalists have created.
[00:50:20.414 --> 00:50:23.155]  And they're depopulating the planet.
[00:50:23.155 --> 00:50:25.557]  Because they don't want the general public to have access to it.
[00:50:25.557 --> 00:50:27.157]  Well, that's what they want.
[00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.018]  That's their endgame.
[00:50:28.018 --> 00:50:29.599]  That's their goal.
[00:50:29.599 --> 00:50:36.783]  And so really one of the best places that I was able to influence people about what was coming a long time ago was Deuce X.
[00:50:38.197 --> 00:50:42.522]  And a whole bunch of top video games were heavily influenced by this show.
[00:50:42.522 --> 00:50:44.985]  And that's just a report to listeners.
[00:50:44.985 --> 00:50:52.835]  Thank you for the support to keep us on air because we're having such a giant effect and we're heavy influences on you name it.
[00:50:52.835 --> 00:50:55.799]  All the top people resisting the globalists have told me
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.482]  With a Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or you name it, that we're a heavy influence on them.
[00:51:00.482 --> 00:51:09.127]  And that means you are one of the main influences with your calls and your intel and your support and the guests and all of the things we do here today.
[00:51:09.127 --> 00:51:13.430]  We're wildly successful at fighting the globalists and the establishment knows that.
[00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.651]  That's why they're so upset.
[00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:22.135]  So I want to speak some about the different scenarios that could lead to nuclear war.
[00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:25.282]  And why?
[00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:30.724]  Basically, I haven't found any top experts that are saying we're not in the greatest danger we've ever been.
[00:51:30.724 --> 00:51:33.706]  The International Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is very respected.
[00:51:33.706 --> 00:51:35.527]  They say we're the closest ever.
[00:51:35.527 --> 00:51:37.427]  The Pentagon says we're the closest ever.
[00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:40.069]  The Russians say we're the closest ever.
[00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:46.792]  Most analysts agree we are the closest to nuclear war we've ever been.
[00:51:47.995 --> 00:51:55.439]  So after Owen leaves us, it'll be almost about 30 minutes before he disappears to a federal prison.
[00:51:55.439 --> 00:52:10.847]  I will spend some time on that and then we'll open the phones up at the bottom of the hour, next hour, and I will go to your calls before the hour ends and the full third hour will be calls.
[00:52:10.847 --> 00:52:14.049]  So that said,
[00:52:19.144 --> 00:52:23.837]  Let me tell you what else is going to be coming up here, and I'm going to start getting to it right now.
[00:52:23.837 --> 00:52:27.145]  The destruction of the Western world's economy by design.
[00:52:27.987 --> 00:52:39.231]  And the flooding of the borders at record levels, even breaking Biden's and Obama's previous records that were shut down when Trump was in office.
[00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:41.532]  And that ties into the economy.
[00:52:41.532 --> 00:52:45.254]  There's never been a worse time to buy instead of rent, you're being told.
[00:52:45.254 --> 00:52:49.375]  And how that ties into Klaus Schwab, you'll own nothing and you'll be happy.
[00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:54.898]  I'll explain how that trap works coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:52:54.898 --> 00:52:55.678]  In fact, right now.
[00:52:57.159 --> 00:53:10.049]  Then I'm going to get into even Politico reporting on what we told you three and a half years ago, how Bill Gates and his partners took over the global COVID pandemic response.
[00:53:10.049 --> 00:53:14.913]  And why that's important is Fauci is still in command as Bill Gates' deputy.
[00:53:14.913 --> 00:53:21.938]  Dr. Fauci is sharing his new nightmare that he created about the next inevitable pandemic.
[00:53:21.938 --> 00:53:26.782]  Remember, he famously said Trump will be challenged soon by a novel virus, and then sure enough, they did it.
[00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:31.914]  Here's the article on Ascience.org, what keeps me up at night?
[00:53:31.914 --> 00:53:38.681]  We're going to be hitting that in detail today as well.
[00:53:38.681 --> 00:53:48.793]  And then a really disgusting development that's happening all over the Western world, and it's all coordinated from Australia to the UK to the US to Canada to Germany from Sweden to Denmark.
[00:53:50.669 --> 00:54:05.043]  Hospital networks are telling parents that they're not going to tell them what prescription drugs their children are on because they want to help them transition and also want to help them commit suicide.
[00:54:05.043 --> 00:54:14.333]  So we've got a big stack of beyond critical intel on that front.
[00:54:15.587 --> 00:54:18.730]  Let me continue with what we've got here for you.
[00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:28.698]  And this just speaks to the insanity of our age, which suicides off the charts, mass murder by random individuals is just way up.
[00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:33.081]  There's a lot of psychotic craziness going on.
[00:54:33.081 --> 00:54:38.866]  And I want to believe the pilots that were there that let the other pilot that was traveling somewhere sit in the jump seat.
[00:54:39.975 --> 00:54:40.795]  Maybe it's not true.
[00:54:40.795 --> 00:54:41.495]  I don't know.
[00:54:41.495 --> 00:54:53.038]  It's hard to believe that he tried to shut both engines down by killing him with fire extinguishers that are built into them after the plane took off, which would be the best time to kill everybody.
[00:54:53.038 --> 00:54:57.939]  He wanted to do that, but luckily they were able to stop it before the engines totally conked out.
[00:54:57.939 --> 00:54:59.139]  Total family man.
[00:54:59.139 --> 00:54:59.859]  Loved by everybody.
[00:54:59.859 --> 00:55:01.460]  No criminal record.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.501]  And now he's facing 80 plus counts of attempted murder.
[00:55:05.501 --> 00:55:06.721]  What is all that about?
[00:55:07.938 --> 00:55:10.619]  I want to drill into that.
[00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:19.083]  Also, Jenna Ellis pleads guilty in Trump election case, implicates Rudy Giuliani and others.
[00:55:19.083 --> 00:55:30.868]  So this is getting wild, absolutely wild, as they indict all these politicos, knowing they will roll over and make up stuff about Trump, because I've studied what happened.
[00:55:30.868 --> 00:55:34.909]  Trump did not tell them to do any of these things they're claiming, and they have no evidence of it.
[00:55:34.909 --> 00:55:36.130]  In fact, in the Chesborough,
[00:55:37.008 --> 00:55:37.629]  Pleading guilty.
[00:55:37.629 --> 00:55:40.591]  His lawyer was on the news saying, I've talked to Chesbrough.
[00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:43.894]  Trump never told him to go try to get these computers and check them.
[00:55:43.894 --> 00:55:45.295]  They were just trying to research what happened.
[00:55:45.295 --> 00:55:49.138]  And he didn't talk to Trump.
[00:55:49.138 --> 00:55:53.001]  And so we're not pleading guilty to go after Trump.
[00:55:53.001 --> 00:55:55.183]  And the corporate media was so angry about that.
[00:55:55.183 --> 00:55:59.967]  But they're trying to find somebody that'll make something up against Trump.
[00:56:00.714 --> 00:56:08.882]  Alright, let me go to break and I'll come back with Owen Schroer and then I'll get into all the nuclear war news and that scenario and the open borders and the economy and more.
[00:56:08.882 --> 00:56:15.248]  But I've got a proposal for viewers and listeners to do something that it's a no-brainer that every medicine cabinet should have.
[00:56:16.189 --> 00:56:19.570]  That last indefinitely, that everybody should be stockpiling.
[00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:24.891]  For sore throats, or for sinus infections, I put it in a neti pot and put it up my sinus.
[00:56:24.891 --> 00:56:25.891]  Works great.
[00:56:25.891 --> 00:56:35.913]  When a lot of the antibiotics out there stop working, colloidal silver is great, and 30 parts per million is what the experts say is the safest, best system to do.
[00:56:35.913 --> 00:56:41.814]  It's also great for your gums, and I like to put it on my toothpaste, and when I brush my teeth in the morning.
[00:56:41.814 --> 00:56:44.255]  We have the highest rated private labeled
[00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:50.509]  There is, it's Silver Bullet, it's finally back in stock, and it's discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:56:50.509 --> 00:57:05.352]  So while you're on the site, getting a copy of my book, or getting a t-shirt, or getting a film, or getting some of the InfoWars Platinum products, or getting DNA Force Plus, or getting Brain Force Plus, the great new drug that's still 60% off, but it absolutely will drop dead end Thursday.
[00:57:05.352 --> 00:57:11.113]  Okay, they're just doing an update to the sites, they can't change the sales now, so it's done Thursday.
[00:57:11.113 --> 00:57:12.053]  Thursday morning it'll be over.
[00:57:12.873 --> 00:57:19.136]  But while you're there, you should get a bottle of Silver Bullet or a couple bottles and give them to your friends and family because...
[00:57:21.329 --> 00:57:24.091]  It just is an amazing thing to have in your arsenal.
[00:57:24.091 --> 00:57:24.892]  Antiviral.
[00:57:24.892 --> 00:57:26.353]  Antibacterial.
[00:57:26.353 --> 00:57:27.374]  It's no panacea.
[00:57:27.374 --> 00:57:28.554]  Nothing is a smoking gun.
[00:57:28.554 --> 00:57:30.476]  Nothing is a silver bullet.
[00:57:30.476 --> 00:57:32.617]  But as close as you're going to get to it, it is silver bullet.
[00:57:32.617 --> 00:57:34.219]  Highest quality global silver.
[00:57:34.219 --> 00:57:34.759]  In stock.
[00:57:34.759 --> 00:57:35.840]  Ready to ship.

[00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:39.903]  Or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.

[00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:45.066]  And thanks for keeping us on air.
[00:57:45.066 --> 00:57:45.567]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.867 --> 00:57:54.408]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:57:54.408 --> 00:57:59.570]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:03.031]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:58:03.031 --> 00:58:04.091]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:58:04.091 --> 00:58:08.572]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[00:58:08.572 --> 00:58:14.454]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:58:15.194 --> 00:58:22.182]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists, and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:58:22.182 --> 00:58:25.847]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[00:58:25.847 --> 00:58:30.372]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:30.932]  We're good.
[00:58:49.779 --> 00:58:57.624]  The most powerful LymphoWars live formula yet, DNA Force Plus is now back in stock for 50% off in our flash sale.
[00:58:57.624 --> 00:59:08.009]  This elite formula contains the most cutting-edge enzymes, potent antioxidants, and traditional naturally occurring ingredients to protect the vitality of your very DNA.
[00:59:08.009 --> 00:59:16.114]  The powerhouse ingredients in DNA Force Plus include QQQ, CoQ10, organic reishi mushroom, astrologous root,
[00:59:16.334 --> 00:59:17.114]  We're good to go.
[00:59:38.863 --> 00:59:42.067]  With DNA Force Plus and Body Soul Support.
[00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:51.438]  Better hurry though because these sales will be over in a flash at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:51.438 --> 00:59:57.345]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.078 --> 01:00:11.841]  Owen Schroyer, outside the federal prison in Louisiana, is about to turn himself in.
[01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:12.802]  We're connected to him right now.
[01:00:12.802 --> 01:00:14.623]  He'll join us next segment.
[01:00:14.623 --> 01:00:17.645]  But the Big Vivek Ramaswamy interview has now dropped.
[01:00:17.645 --> 01:00:18.646]  It's going mega viral.
[01:00:18.646 --> 01:00:21.108]  Thanks to Jack Kosobik and others getting it out there.
[01:00:21.108 --> 01:00:23.009]  It's going to get tens of millions of views.
[01:00:23.009 --> 01:00:24.931]  It was a very important hour-long interview.
[01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:27.893]  Let's play a few clips from the interview when you visit our studios.
[01:00:27.893 --> 01:00:31.256]  About a week and a half ago, they now dropped the interview.
[01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:32.757]  With most people, I can come on here
[01:00:33.775 --> 01:00:41.217]  I can come on here, and if people like this, they go, I'll go find Alex Jones' show on X or on Facebook or on the podcasting thing.
[01:00:41.217 --> 01:00:42.918]  I've been delisted from everywhere.
[01:00:42.918 --> 01:00:48.679]  So I have to sit here and point out to viewers, if you want to find what I'm actually saying, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:52.121]  And in normal etiquette for a talk show, that's like somebody pitching themselves.
[01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:56.862]  No, I'm isolated, surrounded, can only communicate when people like you let me out
[01:00:57.302 --> 01:00:58.863]  I've already learned something today that's frightening.
[01:01:22.817 --> 01:01:24.258]  There's so many bigger things than me.
[01:01:24.258 --> 01:01:31.024]  I mean, there's these wars, and there's the casual society, and the open borders, and all the race-baiting.
[01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:32.566]  I mean, we're being divided and conquered.
[01:01:32.566 --> 01:01:39.312]  That's why your message of coming together to celebrate our hard-fought American freedoms is so essential.
[01:01:39.312 --> 01:01:42.755]  In 1950, the United States had half the wealth in the world.
[01:01:44.269 --> 01:01:44.829]  Is that right?
[01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:45.710]  Because of our invention.
[01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.331]  Immediately post-World War II.
[01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:47.991]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:51.473]  Post-World War II, we had half the world's wealth, and we were 4% of the world's population.
[01:01:51.473 --> 01:01:52.854]  As measured by GDP, probably.
[01:01:52.854 --> 01:01:54.095]  As measured by GDP.
[01:01:54.095 --> 01:01:56.016]  So that's the GDP of the world.
[01:01:56.016 --> 01:01:56.736]  What is it today?
[01:01:56.736 --> 01:01:57.377]  I should know these things.
[01:01:57.377 --> 01:01:58.257]  It's gone down a lot.
[01:01:58.257 --> 01:02:01.279]  I think it's in the high 20s, early 30s.
[01:02:01.279 --> 01:02:02.339]  Yeah, sounds about right.
[01:02:02.339 --> 01:02:03.520]  Maybe a quarter to a third.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.103]  I haven't looked at it in a while, but what I'm getting at here is what you said is so dead on.
[01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.404]  In fact, I need to make that point more.
[01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:10.704]  You can pull these clips up.
[01:02:10.704 --> 01:02:11.565]  Remember when Obama
[01:02:12.455 --> 01:02:17.759]  Went to Latin America the last few months of his administration.
[01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:19.900]  Then he went to a bunch of countries in Africa.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:23.803]  And he gave the same speech, Vivek, in every country.
[01:02:23.803 --> 01:02:27.146]  He said, quote, you can't have cars and air conditioning.
[01:02:27.146 --> 01:02:29.587]  The world's going to heat up and burn up.
[01:02:29.587 --> 01:02:36.833]  If everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning and everybody's got a big house,
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.661]  Well, the planet will boil over.
[01:02:40.661 --> 01:02:44.224]  Now, here's a guy flying on a giant jet with dozens of aircraft.
[01:02:44.224 --> 01:02:46.185]  After that, he has private jets.
[01:02:46.185 --> 01:02:59.953]  He has houses at basically sea level in Martha's Vineyard in Hawaii, though he said we were already supposed to be underwater by 2017, though they keep just buying, Al Gore, all of them, oceanfront property, not up on cliffs or something.
[01:02:59.953 --> 01:03:01.334]  They're bearing that cross.
[01:03:02.114 --> 01:03:02.534]  Absolutely.
[01:03:02.534 --> 01:03:04.335]  They're bearing that cross for the rest of us.
[01:03:04.335 --> 01:03:05.295]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:07.857]  They're on private jets.
[01:03:07.857 --> 01:03:09.978]  People like Ted Turner has like five kids.
[01:03:09.978 --> 01:03:12.279]  He says, I want to depopulate 90% of the world's population.
[01:03:12.279 --> 01:03:13.219]  Look it up.
[01:03:13.219 --> 01:03:14.580]  Him on Charlie Rose.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.000]  Well, he has five kids.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.081]  He has jets.
[01:03:17.081 --> 01:03:18.421]  He has palatial compounds.
[01:03:18.421 --> 01:03:22.323]  But you in Africa, you can't aspire.
[01:03:22.323 --> 01:03:24.344]  You need to live in this, we'll eat the bugs.
[01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:26.885]  W.E.F.
[01:03:26.885 --> 01:03:32.574]  rationing for the good of the earth while the ruling class lives like kings and goes around in their giant superyachts.
[01:03:33.356 --> 01:03:34.996]  To mountaintops in Davos.
[01:03:34.996 --> 01:03:43.838]  With carbon footprints thousands of times an American, and an American's carbon footprint is 30, 40, 50 times than somebody in Congo.
[01:03:43.838 --> 01:04:00.361]  So in Congo, you don't get anything, and so it's the decision to not industrialize those countries, and that's how they control third world countries, and then they sit back and say, well that's why you're in squalor, because you're not as good as us, we're going to take care of you, but now that same inherent elitism, beyond racism,
[01:04:01.101 --> 01:04:07.863]  is now being used against the West, and they're now impoverishing the West as a political tool of control.
[01:04:07.863 --> 01:04:12.805]  I'm just going to say, I'm personally a little bit blushing here.
[01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:15.606]  I don't even know about this legal procedure.
[01:04:15.606 --> 01:04:19.507]  That's because they're not supposed to use it.
[01:04:19.507 --> 01:04:22.968]  So it's not even that you don't show up and you default.
[01:04:22.968 --> 01:04:23.728]  That's what it's supposed to be.
[01:04:23.728 --> 01:04:28.550]  If you're not participating in the process, according to the standards that they set,
[01:04:29.457 --> 01:04:31.518]  And then you're set a bar you can't reach.
[01:04:31.518 --> 01:04:34.240]  I'm going to go back and learn the heck about this.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:41.524]  Because this is, I mean, if what you described is true, that is a real danger to the integrity of the judicial system.
[01:04:41.524 --> 01:04:43.265]  And that's the cutting edge.
[01:04:43.265 --> 01:04:45.346]  I'm going to independently learn about this myself.
[01:04:45.346 --> 01:04:53.710]  But the point is, they can default you even if the judge deems you not actively or sufficiently participating in discovery.
[01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.231]  Yes.
[01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:56.032]  In a civil trial.
[01:04:56.032 --> 01:04:56.852]  Depends on which state.
[01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:58.093]  And just like I was telling people,
[01:04:59.909 --> 01:05:03.972]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:05:03.972 --> 01:05:07.534]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:05:07.534 --> 01:05:12.618]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:15.080]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:23.666]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:05:23.666 --> 01:05:24.987]  This is the Great Awakening.
[01:05:25.507 --> 01:05:29.872]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:05:29.872 --> 01:05:36.540]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:40.384]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:43.045]  The front lines of the information war.
[01:05:43.045 --> 01:05:43.405]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:36.272]  Well, we've only got 25 minutes with him because he's got to leave right now at like 1230 Central.
[01:06:36.272 --> 01:06:38.274]  He's got to turn himself into federal prison.
[01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:45.833]  As the judge said in his sentencing, he is non-repentant.
[01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:48.294]  He still says the election was stolen.
[01:06:48.294 --> 01:06:51.576]  Even if he was wrong, he has that right under our chair's First Amendment.
[01:06:51.576 --> 01:06:54.158]  It's why it comes first, but he's right about it.
[01:06:54.158 --> 01:06:55.178]  They've charged Trump for it.
[01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.500]  So, it's got a lot of coverage right now.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.181]  Here's Jack Posobiec, great Jack Posobiec.
[01:07:00.037 --> 01:07:00.838]  Breaking.
[01:07:00.838 --> 01:07:03.699]  Brother Owen is on his way to federal prison today.
[01:07:03.699 --> 01:07:05.540]  He has become a symbol.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:11.304]  Our Lord is using him to expose the true face of the demonic forces that have taken control of this regime.
[01:07:11.304 --> 01:07:12.305]  May the sword of St.
[01:07:12.305 --> 01:07:17.488]  Michael defend him and may he get all the support in this time.
[01:07:17.488 --> 01:07:18.208]  Another one.
[01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:23.271]  Political prisoner Owen says, that's his Owen Troyer, 7076.
[01:07:23.271 --> 01:07:24.512]  Follow him on Twitter.
[01:07:24.512 --> 01:07:27.054]  Here is how you can reach Owen while he's away.
[01:07:28.149 --> 01:07:32.612]  Owen greatly appreciates anyone who takes the time to contact him during this time.
[01:07:32.612 --> 01:07:36.014]  He has to work all day at the facility to get some calls out.
[01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:41.158]  We ask you to please respect the rules and regulations of the facility that can be seen here.
[01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:46.581]  Continuing, Charlie Kirk, today is a political prisoner report to federal prison for speech crime.
[01:07:46.581 --> 01:07:48.182]  He's reporting for speech crime.
[01:07:48.182 --> 01:07:52.065]  He works for Infowars, so you are supposed to ignore it and act like it's okay.
[01:07:52.065 --> 01:07:52.585]  It's not.
[01:07:52.585 --> 01:07:53.626]  It's repulsive and wrong.
[01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:55.727]  Owen Schroyer did nothing wrong.
[01:07:55.727 --> 01:07:56.728]  And it's Owen Schroyer
[01:07:57.881 --> 01:07:58.782]  We'll put some images.
[01:08:13.604 --> 01:08:14.045]  I don't know.
[01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:37.730]  And so he also fought hard for Joe Biggs and others and he's been under major attack for that.
[01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:40.430]  So both of you are here.
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:44.231]  Quite the moment for America as they set this precedent.
[01:08:44.231 --> 01:08:47.552]  Owen Schroer, Norm Pattis.
[01:08:47.552 --> 01:08:54.114]  Well, you know, Alex, one thing that has been consistent for me throughout this entire process
[01:08:55.123 --> 01:09:06.817]  And even when I watched the left storm the Capitol last week in their pro-Hamas, pro-Palestine demonstration, is that the most important thing here is the First Amendment.
[01:09:06.817 --> 01:09:12.684]  And so when I look at what happened last week, it just displays one more time
[01:09:13.154 --> 01:09:32.592]  That there is clearly injustice in this country, or perhaps better yet, a hierarchy of justice, a double standard of justice, where that would be considered an insurrection if they were wearing red hats, and if they were waving American flags, and if they were saying USA or Trump 2020, that would be an insurrection.
[01:09:32.592 --> 01:09:34.954]  There'd be special committee investigations.
[01:09:34.954 --> 01:09:37.837]  There'd be, all of them would be getting incarcerated.
[01:09:38.644 --> 01:09:40.725]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:09:40.725 --> 01:09:42.506]  I think it's pretty safe to say.
[01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:47.188]  It didn't happen when they tried to storm the Capitol grounds in 2020 when Trump had to go to the bunker.
[01:09:47.188 --> 01:09:54.271]  And I don't want to use our time to go down the list of all the times the left has gotten away with rioting and doing all their activity.
[01:09:54.271 --> 01:10:04.015]  And then me, a peaceful protester, a First Amendment activist, is getting the full extent and beyond, really, beyond anything we've ever seen when it comes to law and punishment.
[01:10:04.015 --> 01:10:05.556]  But here's what remains consistent, Alex.
[01:10:06.497 --> 01:10:10.780]  Is that the First Amendment is the biggest concern here in my country is the biggest concern.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.181]  You know, I think I'll probably be able to get through this.
[01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:15.583]  It might be some long days and some long nights.
[01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:17.584]  Maybe the biggest challenge of my life.
[01:10:17.584 --> 01:10:21.186]  Who knows what try to what things they try to do to mess with me while I'm in there.
[01:10:21.186 --> 01:10:24.648]  Who knows what other plans they may have for me while I'm in there while I'm out.
[01:10:24.648 --> 01:10:27.170]  But what remains the top concern is the First Amendment.
[01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:28.571]  And so I would argue
[01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:34.838]  That the individuals that went to the Capitol for pro-Hamas last week, that's their First Amendment right.
[01:10:34.838 --> 01:10:38.342]  I would argue that that is their First Amendment right, and they have every right to do it.
[01:10:38.342 --> 01:10:40.605]  But the difference is, I don't have that right.
[01:10:41.232 --> 01:10:46.814]  And so if the First Amendment is not applied to every American, then we don't have a First Amendment.
[01:10:46.814 --> 01:10:53.615]  And if the First Amendment doesn't apply to every American, some get punished for their speech, then we now have an injustice system.
[01:10:53.615 --> 01:11:00.897]  So, the reason why now, and I'm going to let Norm speak about this, we're going to take this to the Supreme Court, because this is bigger than me.
[01:11:00.897 --> 01:11:09.840]  This is a precedent-setting, landmark case that Americans can be imprisoned for thought crime, for speech crime, but not only that.
[01:11:10.629 --> 01:11:18.033]  An overreach of government and a clear double standard, and what to me can only be described as political persecution in what I'm going through.
[01:11:18.033 --> 01:11:23.135]  So, the next step is the Supreme Court, Alex, and I want Norm to talk more about that now.
[01:11:23.135 --> 01:11:24.556]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:11:24.556 --> 01:11:29.618]  Owen, thank you for letting me share this really, really dark, dark, dark day in American history.
[01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.599]  You know, before 2 o'clock today, that's the turn-in deadline.
[01:11:32.599 --> 01:11:33.640]  A door will close.
[01:11:34.096 --> 01:11:37.980]  It won't just close behind Owen, it'll close behind all of us.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:44.407]  And I think we should have a moment of silence at 2 o'clock today, maybe every day at 2 o'clock until Owen comes home.
[01:11:44.407 --> 01:11:50.173]  Because what's being shut in your face is your ability to speak freely.
[01:11:50.816 --> 01:11:58.765]  The First Amendment guarantees people the right to speak, the right to petition for the redress of grievances, whether right or wrong those grievances.
[01:11:58.765 --> 01:12:00.107]  There's no acid test.
[01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.790]  You don't get to petition only for the approved grievances.
[01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:06.234]  You get to pick what you're aggrieved about and to peacefully assemble.
[01:12:06.821 --> 01:12:12.723]  On January 6, 2021, there were people assembled on the Capitol who believed the election had been stolen.
[01:12:12.723 --> 01:12:14.063]  Many still do.
[01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:18.965]  Many are uneasy about what's going on in the country, and they came because they wanted to be heard.
[01:12:18.965 --> 01:12:21.765]  They wanted significance in their own skin, in their own communities.
[01:12:21.765 --> 01:12:24.866]  Owen, Alex, and others were there that day.
[01:12:24.866 --> 01:12:30.528]  The Justice Department has leaned in, and it's leaned in with iron fists to send a message.
[01:12:31.064 --> 01:12:32.865]  This shall never happen again.
[01:12:32.865 --> 01:12:36.025]  But they're not talking about the storming of the Capitol.
[01:12:36.025 --> 01:12:47.068]  The practical consequences of these prosecutions is that your First Amendment right to speak your mind and to hold your government accountable is being thrown away.
[01:12:47.068 --> 01:12:53.310]  And Owen is political prisoner number 0001 in this latest assault on the First Amendment.
[01:12:53.683 --> 01:12:58.426]  There will be a zero-two and a zero-three, and there'll be as many as we let them get away with.
[01:12:58.426 --> 01:13:00.687]  I think Owen put it well.
[01:13:00.687 --> 01:13:11.154]  He's not concerned about himself, he's apprehensive, but I know Owen well, and I think what he was saying is he's really less concerned about his fate than he is the fate of America.
[01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:13.796]  And candidly, folks, you should share that concern.
[01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.324]  You know, we went to the D.C.
[01:13:16.324 --> 01:13:18.565]  Appellate Courts last week.
[01:13:18.565 --> 01:13:31.471]  We asked Judge Timothy J. Kelly to keep Owen out of prison pending his appeal because the use of his speech as an aggravating factor for a trespassing sentencing was unprecedented in American history.
[01:13:31.471 --> 01:13:33.892]  I've never seen anything like it in the modern era.
[01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:37.331]  Judge Telly said no, he's got to go to jail.
[01:13:37.331 --> 01:13:44.538]  We filed an emergency request for relief to the second court just below the Supreme Court, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
[01:13:44.538 --> 01:13:49.062]  Last night at about 6.30, 7 o'clock, they rejected Owen's appeal.
[01:13:49.062 --> 01:13:51.825]  Or not his appeal, but his request for relief pending appeal.
[01:13:52.185 --> 01:13:53.687]  So Owen goes to prison today.
[01:13:53.687 --> 01:13:55.989]  His appellate brief is due in the D.C.
[01:13:55.989 --> 01:13:57.090]  Circuit in December.
[01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:59.292]  We'll get it filed next month.
[01:13:59.292 --> 01:14:06.979]  And hopefully we'll win and get the proceedings vacated and Owen will be resentenced to what was the presumptively reasonable sentence.
[01:14:11.983 --> 01:14:13.885]  And I'm not trying to be racial, they're the ones doing it.
[01:14:13.885 --> 01:14:17.608]  White people, conservatives the main terror threat.
[01:14:17.608 --> 01:14:22.451]  You've got Hezbollah running around attacking people in cars in Minnesota because they're white.
[01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:24.773]  And saying, get the old white man out.
[01:14:24.773 --> 01:14:28.536]  I mean, this has been done, saying kill all the Jews.
[01:14:28.536 --> 01:14:29.477]  This is who the left is.
[01:14:29.477 --> 01:14:31.939]  This is what they stand for.
[01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:35.382]  But for those who don't know, they didn't arrest me because they said, well,
[01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:40.856]  Jones wasn't arrested previously at the Capitol like Owen.
[01:14:40.856 --> 01:14:47.865]  Owen saw the news where the left could take over, attack offices, attack people, throw fake blood on people, red paint.
[01:14:47.865 --> 01:14:48.325]  He went.
[01:14:49.474 --> 01:14:59.144]  And famously a few years ago, like three years ago, wore a sticker over his mouth in the rotunda at the Capitol, the same place that the pro-Hezbollah people took over last week.
[01:14:59.144 --> 01:15:02.507]  They pushed through cops and actually attacked cops and pushed through barriers.
[01:15:02.507 --> 01:15:03.488]  Owen didn't do that.
[01:15:03.488 --> 01:15:04.970]  He wore a sticker over his mouth.
[01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:05.991]  There's footage.
[01:15:05.991 --> 01:15:06.852]  They arrested him.
[01:15:07.372 --> 01:15:10.953]  So they said because he'd been there before, they charged him.
[01:15:10.953 --> 01:15:21.217]  But then in the actual sentencing document, as you know better than I, Norm, and we showed it on air probably 20 times, they said he's unrepentant, he's still saying the election was stolen.
[01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:32.422]  So Owen was arrested and indicted and arrested because he wore tape over his mouth and came back a second time when the left is allowed to do whatever they want, Norm.
[01:15:33.806 --> 01:15:35.108]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:15:35.108 --> 01:15:37.331]  And let's, you know, I mean, left, right.
[01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:38.633]  I actually agree with you.
[01:15:38.633 --> 01:15:41.817]  It's not a crime to be on the right.
[01:15:42.307 --> 01:15:46.030]  In this country, although they're treating us that way at this point.
[01:15:46.030 --> 01:16:05.864]  You know, if you look back at the history of the United States, and you look back at the Church Commission, and the Church Committee's study of the assassination of, excuse me, the Church Committee's assessment of the treatment of Martin Luther King and other civil rights activists, what we learned is the FBI and law enforcement targeted the left for harassment.
[01:16:06.204 --> 01:16:26.830]  The Warren Committee did such a horrible job investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy, we then had a special House committee that looked at assassinations of Martin Luther King, looked at the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and raised questions that to this day remain unanswered about the intelligence community's role in these events.
[01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:29.531]  And, you know, I say, I choose these words carefully.
[01:16:29.929 --> 01:16:32.451]  Yeah, you know, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:16:32.451 --> 01:16:36.816]  I believe generally that things clunk along and it's a miracle that anything gets done.
[01:16:36.816 --> 01:16:40.019]  But one thing we know is that power abhors a vacuum.
[01:16:40.019 --> 01:16:42.801]  And those in control seek more control.
[01:16:42.801 --> 01:16:44.623]  And it's a game for them.
[01:16:44.623 --> 01:16:48.287]  And the game right now for the left is to criminalize the right.
[01:16:48.829 --> 01:17:04.001]  And what everything that was going on in the area of the Church Committee, everything the intelligence communities were up to in the era of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and others, everything, those mechanisms have gotten more powerful, not less powerful.
[01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:05.983]  There's more absolute surveillance.
[01:17:05.983 --> 01:17:07.724]  There's more social media surveillance.
[01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:09.465]  There's more algorithmic control.
[01:17:09.465 --> 01:17:15.130]  There are more efforts to digitalize your interaction with the world so that your every move can be forecast and monitored.
[01:17:15.509 --> 01:17:23.012]  Folks, there is a fight going on for the soul of America, and it's your soul that's being sought here.
[01:17:23.012 --> 01:17:26.273]  And so, Olin, I'm extremely proud of you.
[01:17:26.273 --> 01:17:27.853]  I have been since the day I met him.
[01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:35.656]  I'm extremely proud of my representation of you, Alex, and the folks at InfoWars, because there truly is an information war going on.
[01:17:36.078 --> 01:17:38.179]  And what's at stake is your soul.
[01:17:38.179 --> 01:17:41.762]  And how you respond to that defines what America becomes.
[01:17:41.762 --> 01:17:47.205]  Owen today becomes a First Amendment martyr in a new era of repressive prosecution.
[01:17:47.205 --> 01:17:49.747]  He's being punished not because he trespassed.
[01:17:49.747 --> 01:17:51.868]  Many other trespassers got probation.
[01:17:52.561 --> 01:17:54.324]  Owen is being punished.
[01:17:54.324 --> 01:17:58.630]  He's being sent to prison because of what he said and where he worked.
[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:02.055]  And they said that in the sentencing document.
[01:18:02.055 --> 01:18:05.500]  Like you said, we'll talk privately, but he said it on air.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.822]  I mean, you're a lawyer, you know all this.
[01:18:06.822 --> 01:18:08.124]  You're a constitutional lawyer, a famous one.
[01:18:09.423 --> 01:18:10.825]  That will be overturned on appeal.
[01:18:10.825 --> 01:18:13.288]  The fact is they're saying we're doing it for a speech.
[01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:14.970]  We only have 10 minutes left.
[01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:15.831]  I know you've got to go.
[01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:18.394]  You've got to turn yourself in in 30 minutes.
[01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:20.697]  Where are you right now, Owen?
[01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:22.319]  Bigger political issues.
[01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:23.820]  World War III.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:27.064]  That's been my fear, is to be in prison when I can't protect my family.
[01:18:27.694 --> 01:18:30.735]  But I'm going to try to take care of your family and your folks.
[01:18:30.735 --> 01:18:34.617]  I know that's all private, but I mean, this is quite a moment for you, Owen.
[01:18:34.617 --> 01:18:39.619]  I mean, you haven't disclosed to the public about your own personal life and what's going on with you.
[01:18:39.619 --> 01:18:45.842]  But I know personally, as a father, what it's like to be, you know, knowing you've got this responsibility.
[01:18:45.842 --> 01:18:50.144]  And so just comments you want to make right now before you go into that black hole.
[01:18:51.636 --> 01:18:54.557]  Yeah, and the government's well aware of that, too, and they couldn't care less.
[01:18:54.557 --> 01:19:01.618]  There's a lot of other extenuating circumstances that the government is aware of, and they offer no reprieve in any of them.
[01:19:01.618 --> 01:19:04.399]  It almost feels like it... Because you're not a communist pedophile!
[01:19:04.399 --> 01:19:05.899]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:05.899 --> 01:19:11.320]  It added fuel to their hatred that, oh, we can even make him hurt more because this is going on?
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.282]  But before I respond to that, Alex, I think there's one more thing I want to say to the American people, because this is the most important part.
[01:19:19.861 --> 01:19:24.003]  And you know this, we've worked together for a long time now.
[01:19:24.003 --> 01:19:33.628]  I'm a very meticulous and calculated person when it comes to my political activism and my journalistic activities.
[01:19:33.628 --> 01:19:41.932]  And so I wanted to make sure that we have a situation in front of us where we're not comparing apples to oranges, but we're comparing apples to apples.
[01:19:41.932 --> 01:19:48.696]  And so you can go look, the exact same activities that I did when I disrupted the Trump-Polk's impeachment hearing.
[01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:51.563]  Dozens of other Democrats have done.
[01:19:51.563 --> 01:19:58.488]  Whether it was the Gorsuch hearing, the Amy Coney Barrett hearing, the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, David Hogg disrupted hearings.
[01:19:58.488 --> 01:20:01.711]  I mean, not dozens, because sometimes there were hundreds at a time.
[01:20:01.711 --> 01:20:04.113]  I would say there's been dozens of incidents.
[01:20:04.113 --> 01:20:04.893]  Thousands have done it.
[01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:09.109]  So what I'm saying, we're not comparing apples to oranges, we're comparing apples to apples.
[01:20:09.109 --> 01:20:12.710]  The left has done exactly what I did, disrupting government hearings.
[01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:14.851]  They did not get the same punishment I did.
[01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:16.192]  Look at what I did at the Capitol.
[01:20:16.192 --> 01:20:18.292]  I had a piece of tape over my mouth.
[01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:20.813]  I got arrested, spent 36 hours in jail.
[01:20:20.813 --> 01:20:24.495]  Democrats just stormed the Capitol for a pro-Hamas demonstration.
[01:20:24.495 --> 01:20:25.315]  I doubt any of them.
[01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:27.355]  Spend 36 hours in jail.
[01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:30.116]  Democrats were so violent in Washington D.C.
[01:20:30.116 --> 01:20:32.637]  in the summer of 2020, they almost burnt down a church.
[01:20:32.637 --> 01:20:35.958]  Donald Trump, the president, had to be evacuated to a bunker.
[01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:38.679]  And were there going to be mass investigations into that?
[01:20:38.679 --> 01:20:43.860]  Will any of those violent individuals deal with any jail time or any persecution like I've dealt with?
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:44.520]  No.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.901]  So this is what the American person needs to understand.
[01:20:47.481 --> 01:20:49.622]  We're not comparing apples to oranges.
[01:20:49.622 --> 01:20:51.582]  We're comparing apples to apples.
[01:20:51.582 --> 01:20:53.863]  One apple gets a completely different treatment.
[01:20:53.863 --> 01:20:56.044]  The other apple gets protected at all costs.
[01:20:56.044 --> 01:21:02.206]  Now, to respond to your question, we are, I mean, virtually in the middle of Louisiana here.
[01:21:02.206 --> 01:21:12.790]  There's not much around here other than a couple hotels and of course the jail that I'm going to be turning myself into here in about an hour.
[01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:13.210]  And so,
[01:21:14.483 --> 01:21:16.204]  It's a pretty eerie thing.
[01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:22.386]  Let's be clear, you're turning yourself into a federal prison for your speech, the judge said.
[01:21:22.386 --> 01:21:23.286]  Yes, yes.
[01:21:23.286 --> 01:21:25.547]  And we've gone above and beyond to show that.
[01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:34.610]  In fact, Norm and I just shot another video, it's going to be uploaded to Banned Out Video, where we show the proof in the government's own documents that, yes indeed, I'm being incarcerated for my speech.
[01:21:35.342 --> 01:21:47.891]  Um, so, you know, to get personal with it, even though I do believe that the country is my skill, is my main concern, and that's what's going to make me weep in the night, not for my own self, but the future of my country.
[01:21:47.891 --> 01:21:51.134]  But what is unreal about it on a personal level is just...
[01:21:51.734 --> 01:21:52.495]  I don't know.
[01:21:52.495 --> 01:21:54.036]  Part of me still can't even believe it.
[01:21:54.036 --> 01:21:57.899]  Part of me still can't even believe that I'm about to be a speech prisoner.
[01:21:57.899 --> 01:22:10.669]  Part of me still can't even believe that I'm about to sit in a cage for two months when the government knows well that I'm... Oh, and I have interviewed, off record, top federal judges who reached out to me.
[01:22:11.249 --> 01:22:16.171]  Well, and not only that, and the crew can probably find this, it was well covered in the media at the time, back in August 2021.
[01:22:16.171 --> 01:22:17.552]  There was a magistrate judge
[01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:41.631]  Majesty Judge Farouk in D.C.
[01:22:41.631 --> 01:22:46.334]  who looked at my case and challenged the Department of Justice and said, now hold on a second.
[01:22:46.334 --> 01:22:51.937]  You do realize that you're charging a journalist and that there are rules and regulations for charging a journalist.
[01:22:51.937 --> 01:22:53.418]  Did you follow them?
[01:22:53.418 --> 01:22:56.139]  And the Department of Justice just said, buzz off.
[01:22:56.139 --> 01:22:57.960]  We don't have to worry about the rules and regulations.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.881]  I don't know if you want to comment further on that.
[01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:04.024]  The most dangerous man in America right now is not Owen Schwerer.
[01:23:04.024 --> 01:23:05.404]  It's Merrick Garland.
[01:23:05.404 --> 01:23:07.986]  And that Justice Department is out of control.
[01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:16.692]  If you're looking for any other reason, any, I don't care if they put a potted plant up against the Democrats this next election, I'm voting for the potted plant.
[01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:21.935]  Come one o'clock or thereabouts, Owen's going to be walking through that door into a federal prison.
[01:23:21.935 --> 01:23:25.137]  I'll be attending a wake for the First Amendment when that happens.
[01:23:25.137 --> 01:23:31.621]  Judge Farouk, the event that Owen was referring to on his initial presentation in this case, said, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:23:32.182 --> 01:23:33.443]  Shroyer was there as a journalist.
[01:23:33.443 --> 01:23:42.351]  There are department regulations that require the Justice Department to go through a certain protocol before arresting a journalist engaged in First Amendment-protected activity.
[01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.072]  Has the government done this?
[01:23:44.072 --> 01:23:47.095]  And the government, to this day, hasn't responded.
[01:23:47.095 --> 01:23:53.200]  We filed any number of motions challenging the government's conduct as to Shroyer, and we're always told, don't worry about it.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.681]  This case will work out in the end.
[01:23:55.106 --> 01:23:59.307]  And the understanding was that Owen was going to be given probation.
[01:23:59.307 --> 01:24:03.628]  The government welshed on that because hey, hey, ho, ho, Merrick Garland's got to go.
[01:24:03.628 --> 01:24:06.528]  And let's be clear, the media spun that he was ratting people out.
[01:24:06.528 --> 01:24:12.470]  His cell phones had nothing incriminating, so we gave, I said, yeah, Owen has his, okay, I said, sure, we have nothing to hide.
[01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:16.491]  Give him the cell phones, then they lie and still put him in prison.
[01:24:16.491 --> 01:24:18.011]  No, and you know, let me address that.
[01:24:18.359 --> 01:24:20.080]  Derek Cohen is not a rat.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.860]  He's not cooperating against anyone.
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:25.861]  What he's told the government is the truth.
[01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:30.483]  And the truth is there was no insurrection on January 6, 2021.
[01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:32.583]  There was no seditious conspiracy.
[01:24:32.583 --> 01:24:34.664]  There was no plan to topple the government.
[01:24:34.664 --> 01:24:35.944]  There was no coup.
[01:24:35.944 --> 01:24:40.445]  There were tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of angry people in Washington, D.C.
[01:24:40.445 --> 01:24:42.446]  that day, and a riot occurred.
[01:24:42.907 --> 01:24:45.069]  And some people took advantage of the riot.
[01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:48.231]  Sure, but bottom line, Owen's like, it's okay, I'll give them my phone.
[01:24:48.231 --> 01:24:50.232]  They say they'll drop this.
[01:24:50.232 --> 01:24:51.693]  And I'm like, of course, we did nothing wrong.
[01:24:51.693 --> 01:24:55.415]  And so, since there was nothing there, they still put him in prison.
[01:24:55.415 --> 01:24:57.597]  That shows how criminal they are.
[01:24:57.597 --> 01:25:01.179]  So in closing, Owen... They're putting him in for his speech, Alex.
[01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:04.361]  Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise.
[01:25:04.361 --> 01:25:08.644]  Owen Schroer is America's first thought criminal of the 21st century.
[01:25:10.017 --> 01:25:10.838]  That's right.
[01:25:10.838 --> 01:25:13.461]  Owen Schroyer, literally, and it's being recognized.
[01:25:13.461 --> 01:25:14.563]  They're going for broke.
[01:25:14.563 --> 01:25:18.347]  Owen, just big picture, before you go in there, it'll be hard to get calls in.
[01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:20.270]  Call in live, tape it, whatever.
[01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.292]  Every day we'll have reports if you can do it.
[01:25:22.292 --> 01:25:24.014]  But we're not sure what's going to happen.
[01:25:24.014 --> 01:25:25.056]  Owen, closing comments.
[01:25:26.479 --> 01:25:28.782]  Well, first of all, I just want to say this.
[01:25:28.782 --> 01:25:29.823]  I love life.
[01:25:29.823 --> 01:25:30.444]  I really do.
[01:25:30.444 --> 01:25:32.586]  I love my life, even though I'm going through this.
[01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:35.029]  I love everybody that's there at InfoWars, the crew.
[01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.831]  I love everybody in the audience.
[01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:38.653]  My heart is still filled with love.
[01:25:38.653 --> 01:25:42.037]  The outpouring of love and support has filled my soul.
[01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:43.538]  So you're never going to commit suicide?
[01:25:44.827 --> 01:25:45.527]  Of course not.
[01:25:45.527 --> 01:25:46.148]  Of course not.
[01:25:46.148 --> 01:25:59.093]  And I would also just say this, if I have any desires while I'm away, it's that my case, not for my namesake, but for the sake of the First Amendment, become a national, if not an international, news story.
[01:25:59.093 --> 01:26:00.553]  People need to know about this.
[01:26:00.553 --> 01:26:04.615]  They need to know that there's a speech prisoner in the United States of America.
[01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:11.327]  I also hope that when I get out that I'm more able and agile than I've ever been before.
[01:26:11.327 --> 01:26:16.909]  I hope that InfoWars still has a house that I can go and broadcast from every day.
[01:26:16.909 --> 01:26:25.531]  I hope that on an individual level I can expand and grow others and be the next Alex Jones to inspire and improve the media landscape.
[01:26:25.531 --> 01:26:28.331]  And so, in closing, please support my case.
[01:26:28.331 --> 01:26:29.671]  We're taking it to the Supreme Court.
[01:26:29.671 --> 01:26:32.172]  You can go to DefendOwen.com to support that.
[01:26:32.552 --> 01:26:39.334]  I've also launched a storefront so you can fund me in my personal life, because I'm going through a lot right now as well, at owenschroer.store.
[01:26:39.334 --> 01:26:46.316]  That's right, InfoWars is show shot up, we're not even, because I don't run the speech, the news, but I don't run the finances.
[01:26:46.316 --> 01:26:50.597]  We can't even pay you while you're in jail for this period, or in prison.
[01:26:50.597 --> 01:26:57.759]  And here it is folks, we're having our rights stolen, the globalists are taking over, and
[01:26:58.659 --> 01:27:06.844]  Literally, Owen Troyer is the case example of what they want to do.
[01:27:06.844 --> 01:27:09.286]  Owen is prisoner 0001.
[01:27:09.286 --> 01:27:12.148]  Is your number next?
[01:27:12.148 --> 01:27:13.529]  Owen, we got a minute 45.
[01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:16.110]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna have you have the floor.
[01:27:16.110 --> 01:27:19.712]  Just speak right till you get cut off.
[01:27:19.712 --> 01:27:24.455]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, America needs to know about this story.
[01:27:24.455 --> 01:27:26.817]  The whole world needs to know about this story.
[01:27:27.358 --> 01:27:31.362]  It's not about Owen Troyer, it's about the First Amendment, and it's about you.
[01:27:31.362 --> 01:27:35.205]  Truly, I feel I am so blessed and I'm so grateful for my life.
[01:27:35.205 --> 01:27:38.188]  Ever since I was a young person, I wanted to be in media.
[01:27:38.188 --> 01:27:42.312]  Ever since I was a young person, my American dream was to be a talk show host.
[01:27:42.312 --> 01:27:46.276]  And here I sit, an example that the American dream is still possible.
[01:27:46.849 --> 01:27:48.891]  But now it's being ripped away from me.
[01:27:48.891 --> 01:27:51.773]  It's being ripped away from me with what they're trying to do to Infowars.
[01:27:51.773 --> 01:27:56.596]  It's being ripped away from me with what they're doing to incarcerate me for my First Amendment right.
[01:27:56.596 --> 01:27:58.137]  And my heart breaks.
[01:27:58.137 --> 01:28:01.800]  My heart breaks for the young American that wants to be a journalist.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.222]  The young American that wants to get involved in politics.
[01:28:04.222 --> 01:28:06.404]  The young American that wants to be a political activist.
[01:28:06.404 --> 01:28:08.205]  The young American that wants to speak his mind.
[01:28:08.205 --> 01:28:11.207]  My heart breaks that that American might be in fear.
[01:28:11.207 --> 01:28:13.349]  Might be in fear of their government.
[01:28:13.909 --> 01:28:18.792]  And a response or a punishment from an authoritarian government for what they say.
[01:28:18.792 --> 01:28:20.574]  That's not supposed to be happening in America.
[01:28:20.574 --> 01:28:24.576]  You know, they demonize Russia and all these other countries all day long as authoritarians.
[01:28:24.576 --> 01:28:27.358]  Well, now we're living in the authoritarian country.
[01:28:27.358 --> 01:28:31.361]  And so I just think Americans need to recognize this and there needs to be an outcry.
[01:28:31.361 --> 01:28:35.243]  There needs to be an outcry from Americans and there needs to be an outcry politically.
[01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.445]  We have to turn this ship around fast.
[01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:39.306]  It's not just about the economy.
[01:28:39.306 --> 01:28:40.627]  It's not just about free speech.
[01:28:40.627 --> 01:28:41.588]  It's not just about the border.
[01:28:41.588 --> 01:28:43.609]  It's the heart and the soul of this country.
[01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:46.573]  Owen, you're totally right.
[01:28:46.573 --> 01:28:47.634]  We're praying for you.
[01:28:47.634 --> 01:28:48.956]  We're praying for you.
[01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.738]  We're trying to take all our rights right now.
[01:28:50.738 --> 01:28:53.461]  This is a major rallying point.
[01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:54.503]  Owen, God bless you.
[01:28:54.503 --> 01:28:55.464]  We love you.
[01:28:55.464 --> 01:28:56.826]  We'll hopefully hear from you soon.
[01:28:56.826 --> 01:28:57.647]  Great job, Norm Battis.
[01:28:59.141 --> 01:29:03.164]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:29:03.164 --> 01:29:06.727]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:29:06.727 --> 01:29:11.831]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:29:11.831 --> 01:29:14.272]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:29:14.272 --> 01:29:22.879]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:29:22.879 --> 01:29:24.200]  This is the Great Awakening.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.085]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:29:29.085 --> 01:29:35.753]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:30:03.755 --> 01:30:08.919]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:30:08.919 --> 01:30:12.382]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:30:12.382 --> 01:30:13.443]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:30:13.443 --> 01:30:17.926]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.

[01:30:24.531 --> 01:30:31.537]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:30:31.537 --> 01:30:35.180]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent War for the World.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.823]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[01:30:38.823 --> 01:30:39.664]  And just like the last book,
[01:30:40.004 --> 01:30:40.284]  We're good.
[01:30:59.082 --> 01:31:03.587]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned.

[01:31:58.869 --> 01:32:03.191]  The wicked plot against the righteous, and gnash their teeth at them.
[01:32:03.191 --> 01:32:06.413]  But the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
[01:32:07.358 --> 01:32:14.364]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow, to bring down the poor and needy, and slay those whose ways are upright.
[01:32:14.364 --> 01:32:18.828]  But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
[01:32:18.828 --> 01:32:22.991]  Better the little that have righteousness, than the wealth of many wicked.
[01:32:22.991 --> 01:32:26.654]  For the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[01:32:28.123 --> 01:32:33.249]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care, and their inheritance will endure forever.
[01:32:33.249 --> 01:32:36.612]  In times of disaster, they will not wither.
[01:32:36.612 --> 01:32:39.535]  In days of famine, they will have plenty.
[01:32:39.535 --> 01:32:41.778]  But the wicked will perish.
[01:32:41.778 --> 01:32:47.504]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed, and they will develop in smoke.
[01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:06.611]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:26.118]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:26.118 --> 01:33:29.319]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the
[01:33:32.551 --> 01:33:55.322]  Some of my earliest memories are driving down from Dallas, Texas for four hours to Austin to visit my mother's parents, my grandparents, and walking into that house and my grandfather, William Hammond, sitting around that kitchen table,
[01:33:56.579 --> 01:34:00.101]  And talking about Nazi groups they brought into the U.S.
[01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:17.508]  and ICBMs and MIRV technology and Wernher von Braun and space bases, moon bases, nuclear reactors, uranium he discovered as a prospector, wildcatting in West Texas.
[01:34:17.508 --> 01:34:19.589]  And it was just like larger than life.
[01:34:19.589 --> 01:34:23.011]  My mother would say, your grandfather's just a very eccentric man.
[01:34:25.205 --> 01:34:27.507]  It wasn't a very eccentric man.
[01:34:27.507 --> 01:34:29.509]  He was smart as hell.
[01:34:29.509 --> 01:34:34.794]  By the way, I'm a spitting image.
[01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:38.218]  Basically a clone, his revenge.
[01:34:38.218 --> 01:34:43.122]  But he didn't have a beard though.
[01:34:43.122 --> 01:34:43.363]  So
[01:34:44.997 --> 01:34:46.578]  God, ball head, I look so much like him.
[01:34:46.578 --> 01:34:49.480]  It's just people, my mother looks at me and just goes, you look just like my father.
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.084]  She's like, sometimes I walk in, the things I say and do, she goes, it's my father, he's back.
[01:34:54.084 --> 01:34:56.645]  But that's how genetics work.
[01:34:56.645 --> 01:35:06.432]  And I wasn't caught flat footed only because my family were super involved in a lot of weird crap.
[01:35:06.432 --> 01:35:08.054]  And my grandmother never talked about it.
[01:35:08.054 --> 01:35:09.915]  He never said what it was.
[01:35:09.915 --> 01:35:13.638]  I know he was like building robots in the 60s for the Department of Defense.
[01:35:14.764 --> 01:35:15.204]  I don't know.
[01:35:32.423 --> 01:35:32.503]  It's
[01:35:52.981 --> 01:35:57.345]  Like, super soldier at hole nine yards, and his son, who died nine years ago.
[01:35:57.345 --> 01:35:59.187]  My uncle was such an amazing person.
[01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:03.090]  And I'm not bragging about my family, but these were badasses, man.
[01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:06.693]  These were the, these people that committed everything to America.
[01:36:06.693 --> 01:36:10.016]  Everything they had.
[01:36:10.016 --> 01:36:11.337]  And damn, were they right.
[01:36:11.337 --> 01:36:14.500]  Everything my uncle told me was true.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:19.124]  Everything William Hammond told me, and that was the name of his son, was true.
[01:36:23.254 --> 01:36:47.195]  And we have the luxury and we also have the curse to be alive right now in the New World Order takeover and that express elevator to hell of the Antichrist and everything we're about to see fulfilled.
[01:36:55.259 --> 01:37:02.601]  And these candy ass globalists.
[01:37:02.601 --> 01:37:04.181]  And all the things they've done.
[01:37:04.181 --> 01:37:06.062]  You know, I mean, I could tell you more stuff.
[01:37:06.062 --> 01:37:12.284]  You wouldn't believe it.
[01:37:12.284 --> 01:37:16.345]  Oh, my God, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:37:16.345 --> 01:37:17.445]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:37:24.568 --> 01:37:32.071]  But I guess a lot of it's best left unsaid, huh?
[01:37:32.071 --> 01:37:36.053]  I'm sitting here looking at this news.
[01:37:36.053 --> 01:37:41.715]  Maybe we should play that little short Elon Musk clip from yesterday where he said, we're sleepwalking into World War III.
[01:37:41.715 --> 01:37:44.036]  Yeah, yeah, we'll play that in a minute.
[01:37:44.036 --> 01:37:52.379]  And then we'll, uh, kind of punt and just open the phones up and take your calls.
[01:37:54.258 --> 01:37:57.139]  Because I love taking your calls, Angles, you take us in.
[01:37:57.139 --> 01:37:58.299]  So let's do this.
[01:37:58.299 --> 01:38:00.379]  We're not going to do first-time callers.
[01:38:00.379 --> 01:38:01.460]  We'll do long-time callers.
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.880]  We'll do whoever wants to call in.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:08.621]  As long as you've got a clean phone line and ready to make your point, I'm going to go to you and I appreciate you calling.
[01:38:08.621 --> 01:38:08.961]  877-789-2539.
[01:38:08.961 --> 01:38:09.041]  877-789-2539.
[01:38:09.041 --> 01:38:09.302]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[01:38:09.302 --> 01:38:09.382]  877-789.
[01:38:09.382 --> 01:38:11.122]  Alex, we are taking your phone calls right now.
[01:38:25.225 --> 01:38:39.269]  And I will intersperse all the rest of this news while we're here talking about it.
[01:38:39.269 --> 01:38:50.152]  And I'll do the best job I can to expose these people, but at the end of the day, if you don't feel spiritually you're under attack, you're probably dead already.
[01:38:50.152 --> 01:38:50.252]  And
[01:38:51.698 --> 01:39:03.704]  If you don't understand that powerful forces are taking over our civilization and that submitting to them is a fate worse than death, then there's nothing I can really say to you.
[01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.144]  But I think you get it.
[01:39:05.144 --> 01:39:08.606]  And that's why you're tuned in here today.
[01:39:08.606 --> 01:39:11.587]  I meant to play this clip yesterday, but it's really powerful.
[01:39:11.587 --> 01:39:13.048]  So you guys go into yesterday's clip.
[01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:28.592]  Cutting off the head of the snake, Swiss banker Pascal Najali calls on Swiss authorities to arrest people behind the release of bioweapon COVID-19 shot in new documentary.
[01:39:28.592 --> 01:39:30.873]  And then here, he was in the WEF.
[01:39:30.873 --> 01:39:32.354]  Here's the video I want to play.
[01:39:32.354 --> 01:39:35.657]  Switzerland has given the World Economic Forum diplomatic immunity.
[01:39:35.657 --> 01:39:37.558]  The devil lives in Geneva.
[01:39:37.558 --> 01:39:39.179]  And they already had diplomatic immunity 25 years ago.
[01:39:40.498 --> 01:39:50.300]  But they've officially merged it with the UN and said that it's as important as the National Security Council.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:40:01.123]  Then I'm going to get into World War III, after we take a bunch of the calls, and how it could trip off and why all the experts agree we're the closest we've ever been to it.
[01:40:01.123 --> 01:40:06.384]  There aren't more important subjects that could be debated here.
[01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:14.111]  We're going to cover it all here today.
[01:40:14.111 --> 01:40:17.135]  We've still got half the broadcast left or more.
[01:40:17.135 --> 01:40:21.600]  Because I can always steal the fourth hour from the great talk show host that agreed to do it.
[01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:26.933]  But this is a WEF insider.
[01:40:26.933 --> 01:40:39.819]  We played a clip last week of another top WEF insider, a big German professor that was on the board of it, of their digital currency thing, saying they plan to take everything from you, control your behavior, it's a nightmare, we gotta fight it.
[01:40:39.819 --> 01:40:43.601]  I got that clip, I already played it last week, but this is so real.
[01:40:43.601 --> 01:40:47.943]  This is happening now.
[01:40:47.943 --> 01:40:53.006]  Mark and Brad and Mike and Daryl and everybody and Robert, we're going to you here in a moment, but first, this clip.
[01:40:57.602 --> 01:40:58.843]  Geneva.
[01:40:58.843 --> 01:40:59.904]  Looks beautiful.
[01:40:59.904 --> 01:41:00.765]  Is beautiful.
[01:41:00.765 --> 01:41:01.766]  It has a lake.
[01:41:01.766 --> 01:41:03.887]  It has this shadow.
[01:41:03.887 --> 01:41:05.188]  It's very peaceful.
[01:41:05.188 --> 01:41:09.692]  But there is a dark side to it.
[01:41:09.692 --> 01:41:18.039]  Everything evil in the world related to demo side unfortunately comes from Geneva.
[01:41:18.039 --> 01:41:18.400]  You have.
[01:41:19.594 --> 01:41:22.038]  W. Joe in Geneva.
[01:41:22.038 --> 01:41:23.420]  You have Gavi.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:34.377]  Then you have the WEF, the World Economic Forum, which my father was a co-founder and led by Schwab out of disgust in the early 80s, that has diplomatic immunity.
[01:41:35.797 --> 01:41:46.764]  I as a Swiss citizen right here now declare that the WEF is not eligible anymore for diplomatic immunity.
[01:41:46.764 --> 01:41:52.028]  I call on the Swiss authorities to arrest those people immediately.
[01:41:52.028 --> 01:41:52.728]  Why?
[01:41:52.728 --> 01:41:53.109]  The WEF
[01:41:54.335 --> 01:42:15.800]  WHO, Gavi, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Bill Gates, all advocated a global humanity injection by a bioweapon injecting nanolipids into 5.7 billion people.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.581]  And we Swiss are hosting them?
[01:42:20.103 --> 01:42:21.644]  That's terrible.
[01:42:21.644 --> 01:42:31.292]  We cannot tolerate any entity that promotes poison to be injected into humanity.
[01:42:31.292 --> 01:42:32.353]  But you've done it.
[01:42:32.353 --> 01:42:35.295]  I'm the victim, I'm dying from it.
[01:42:35.295 --> 01:42:37.197]  And my mother too.
[01:42:37.197 --> 01:42:41.160]  It's a demo site and you'll be judged.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.682]  It will be corrected in the name of humanity.
[01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:53.936]  Maybe there is a Geneva-Swiss syndrome, but definitely there is a UN syndrome.
[01:42:53.936 --> 01:43:02.702]  Because people are so afraid of what's going on, because the United Nations is occupied, but people in there don't understand.
[01:43:02.702 --> 01:43:09.767]  Those who understand keep quiet or try to speak in different ways to help people to wake up.
[01:43:10.939 --> 01:43:17.002]  So if you understand that, you know that this was very easy to carve a world government.
[01:43:17.002 --> 01:43:23.345]  If you don't have a force that stops that and says, we the people is more important.
[01:43:23.345 --> 01:43:24.566]  And that's what we're doing now.
[01:43:24.566 --> 01:43:28.628]  We're trying to build a we the people movement that is very global.
[01:43:29.872 --> 01:43:31.994]  It's something completely different.
[01:43:31.994 --> 01:43:35.517]  But what is going on in Geneva is the opposite at the moment.
[01:43:35.517 --> 01:43:41.742]  There is no right to WHO to give any orders to dictate to the whole world like they have done.
[01:43:42.836 --> 01:43:50.261]  And the Global Alliance for Vaccine Immunization, GAVI, got total immunity from the Swiss government.
[01:43:50.261 --> 01:43:55.304]  You can find this admin.lex in the Swiss database.
[01:43:55.304 --> 01:43:56.305]  Go and look.
[01:43:56.305 --> 01:43:57.866]  This is coup d'etat, clearly.
[01:43:57.866 --> 01:44:00.308]  It's a global crime scene.
[01:44:00.308 --> 01:44:07.953]  And we are bringing little pieces of evidence to people with humility, because in science, you always have a doubt.
[01:44:07.953 --> 01:44:10.054]  It's a healthy doubt.
[01:44:10.054 --> 01:44:12.636]  And I think that is a very important attitude.
[01:44:13.917 --> 01:44:16.879]  I believe, personally, Geneva has a better future.
[01:44:16.879 --> 01:44:19.982]  Swiss neutrality has to be restored.
[01:44:19.982 --> 01:44:22.223]  We have no future not being neutral.
[01:44:22.223 --> 01:44:35.613]  The young people who survive through this will be the guarantors, hopefully, that such institutions can never again take foothold in our blessed country.
[01:44:35.613 --> 01:44:36.034]  Never again.
[01:44:37.059 --> 01:44:39.340]  The snakehead is in Geneva.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:44.181]  I call it a direct, clear and present danger to the Swiss population.
[01:44:44.181 --> 01:44:48.003]  But I can tell you, it is being cut off.
[01:44:48.003 --> 01:44:54.125]  If you have a house of cards, and this is a house of cards of a criminal,
[01:44:56.039 --> 01:45:00.945]  One card pulled by justice and the whole card house collapses.
[01:45:00.945 --> 01:45:03.148]  But from hope alone it is not done.
[01:45:03.148 --> 01:45:06.292]  Everybody must now change the spirit.
[01:45:06.292 --> 01:45:12.340]  And all the vaccinated, the injected, knowing that they are poison.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.042]  We are the masses.
[01:45:14.042 --> 01:45:14.903]  We are billions of people.
[01:45:16.567 --> 01:45:19.009]  Let's just stand up and say, stop.
[01:45:19.009 --> 01:45:20.690]  We will not comply.
[01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:24.593]  And in French, ni oublie, ni pardon.
[01:45:24.593 --> 01:45:29.636]  Because we're the guardians of humanity and our light obliterates the darkness of evil.
[01:45:29.636 --> 01:45:32.719]  Always.
[01:45:32.719 --> 01:45:33.199]  Powerful.
[01:45:33.199 --> 01:45:38.703]  We're going to post that video on the live show feed of Infowars.com.
[01:45:38.703 --> 01:45:41.865]  And look, Switzerland had another round of elections.
[01:45:41.865 --> 01:45:44.347]  Anti-globalist right wing is taking control of the government.
[01:45:45.342 --> 01:45:48.163]  Right now, here's the overhead shot for TV viewers.
[01:45:48.163 --> 01:45:50.924]  All right, I want to take your phone calls.
[01:45:50.924 --> 01:45:53.204]  I'm going to go about 30 minutes or 40 minutes.
[01:45:53.204 --> 01:45:59.786]  I'll go to the half hour next hour and get through all these 12 callers that are on the board.
[01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:11.710]  And then I'm going to hit the future they've got for us if we don't stop them and the nuclear war scenarios here on this live Tuesday, October 24th, 2023 transmission.
[01:46:11.710 --> 01:46:12.850]  So let's go ahead now.
[01:46:14.219 --> 01:46:16.320]  And let's talk to Mark in Texas.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:16.880]  You're on the air.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.840]  Welcome.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:19.060]  Yeah.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.180]  Can you hear me OK?
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.621]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:21.621 --> 01:46:23.881]  OK, man.
[01:46:23.881 --> 01:46:26.982]  So the whole Antichrist thing, it's coming.
[01:46:26.982 --> 01:46:29.063]  It's for sure coming.
[01:46:29.063 --> 01:46:32.403]  And I think people got to realize more what we need to look for.
[01:46:32.403 --> 01:46:40.845]  And I think that video you guys played the other day with the pastor comparing Allah and all the all the wording and how it.
[01:46:40.845 --> 01:46:41.986]  Sounds like it could be a middle.
[01:46:41.986 --> 01:46:43.506]  It's 100 percent clear, isn't it?
[01:46:44.372 --> 01:46:46.553]  Yeah, so, I mean, everything's lining up, right?
[01:46:46.553 --> 01:46:53.035]  They're going to get everybody into such pure chaos that it's going to be really, really easy to convince everybody.
[01:46:53.035 --> 01:47:00.157]  And they've got Islamic populations in every country, so he calls for peace as the Islamic leader, and then we all join in.
[01:47:00.157 --> 01:47:01.017]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:01.017 --> 01:47:02.097]  Yeah, the infrastructure, exactly.
[01:47:02.097 --> 01:47:03.578]  The infrastructure is already there.
[01:47:03.578 --> 01:47:05.738]  CBDCs are already on the way.
[01:47:05.738 --> 01:47:08.859]  Everything is already here for the march of the beast.
[01:47:08.859 --> 01:47:11.700]  It's ramping up faster than I think a lot of people thought was going to come.
[01:47:13.809 --> 01:47:14.350]  I agree with you.
[01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:15.951]  So what do we do?
[01:47:15.951 --> 01:47:19.714]  Well, uh, man, I think the best thing we can do is just point it out, right?
[01:47:19.714 --> 01:47:23.297]  I think we need to talk to each other, talk to your neighbors, talk to your friends, talk to your family.
[01:47:23.297 --> 01:47:25.439]  Well, that's right, because this is the issue.
[01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:27.060]  There's not side issues.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.181]  That's why they want us off air.
[01:47:28.181 --> 01:47:30.803]  We're covering the real issues.
[01:47:30.803 --> 01:47:31.484]  There's no doubt.
[01:47:31.484 --> 01:47:32.805]  There's no doubt.
[01:47:32.805 --> 01:47:33.365]  It's not me.
[01:47:33.365 --> 01:47:33.926]  It's the guests.
[01:47:33.926 --> 01:47:34.526]  It's the callers.
[01:47:34.526 --> 01:47:35.187]  It's all of it.
[01:47:35.187 --> 01:47:37.488]  This is what they fear right now.
[01:47:37.488 --> 01:47:39.270]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:40.311]  Things we can do, right?
[01:47:40.311 --> 01:47:41.732]  One thing that I've done here recently,
[01:47:43.019 --> 01:47:50.168]  I made a little website and all it is is just to sell one shirt and then literally the shirt says Anti-Antichrist Social Club.
[01:47:50.168 --> 01:47:59.441]  It's like the simplest thing and I took it to church and I sold like 15 or 20 of them the first time I did it and it's just little things like that that we can do.
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:04.848]  To just get people to think, get people to use their brains, and get discernment.
[01:48:04.848 --> 01:48:06.451]  That's right, because where are the churches?
[01:48:06.451 --> 01:48:10.057]  I mean, Bible prophecy is being fulfilled, and they don't want to talk about it.
[01:48:10.057 --> 01:48:10.759]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:10.759 --> 01:48:11.360]  Great points.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.382]  Brad in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:12.382 --> 01:48:12.902]  You're on the air.
[01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:22.870]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex, and I want to say God bless Owen and wish him the best of luck as he prepares to go to jail for no reason.
[01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:24.670]  I want to be clear, because Owen wants this to be clear.
[01:48:24.670 --> 01:48:26.230]  Before he came on, he said this to me.
[01:48:26.230 --> 01:48:27.190]  It's not about him.
[01:48:27.190 --> 01:48:28.811]  It's the milestone.
[01:48:28.811 --> 01:48:30.511]  It's the precedent.
[01:48:30.511 --> 01:48:31.771]  That's just what's big.
[01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:37.992]  A journalist that did nothing wrong, prison, the judge said because you still say the election was stolen.
[01:48:37.992 --> 01:48:39.673]  The judge knows what he's doing.
[01:48:39.673 --> 01:48:41.773]  It's literally a gauntlet in our face.
[01:48:43.672 --> 01:48:49.515]  Yes, and all the judiciaries seem to be weaponized with your case, with his case, with Trump's case.
[01:48:49.515 --> 01:48:50.796]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:50.796 --> 01:48:54.078]  They should all be thrown out.
[01:48:54.078 --> 01:48:55.559]  Well, that's where they got their beachhead.
[01:48:55.559 --> 01:48:56.959]  But they're in their own world.
[01:48:56.959 --> 01:48:57.700]  They have no idea.
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:58.901]  The world has changed.
[01:48:58.901 --> 01:49:00.561]  People are not buying any of this.
[01:49:00.561 --> 01:49:02.523]  And they're figuring that out right now.
[01:49:02.523 --> 01:49:05.444]  They're figuring it out.
[01:49:05.444 --> 01:49:08.446]  On the Middle East, I wanted to mention that, you know,
[01:49:09.204 --> 01:49:13.806]  This all goes back to, we're under one world government already in my opinion.
[01:49:13.806 --> 01:49:16.288]  Government by BlackRock, absolutely.
[01:49:16.288 --> 01:49:19.089]  We're under global corporate government now.
[01:49:19.089 --> 01:49:19.689]  We have been.
[01:49:19.689 --> 01:49:26.293]  It started in Europe with their elections, they started stealing those and it took about five or ten years to get over here and now it's happening here.
[01:49:27.276 --> 01:49:32.778]  And then all the governments act in unison.
[01:49:32.778 --> 01:49:33.719]  We just don't see it.
[01:49:33.719 --> 01:49:34.419]  We don't see it clearly.
[01:49:34.419 --> 01:49:35.640]  Let's not make a point.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:38.641]  Every segment, whether it's Australia or Canada or the U.S.
[01:49:38.641 --> 01:49:41.862]  or Germany, it's the same policies, the same propaganda.
[01:49:41.862 --> 01:49:44.203]  We don't say that to be negative and depress people.
[01:49:44.203 --> 01:49:45.444]  We believe in humanity.
[01:49:45.444 --> 01:49:47.865]  We're telling people how much trouble we're in.
[01:49:47.865 --> 01:49:49.846]  It's like somebody's already beaten the hell out of you.
[01:49:49.846 --> 01:49:51.847]  You've got to admit it's happening and stand up and fight.
[01:49:51.847 --> 01:49:54.148]  We're just telling people the facts.
[01:49:54.148 --> 01:49:54.828]  It's going down.
[01:49:56.610 --> 01:50:02.456]  Yes, and just like your last caller said, we're out of chaos is what their objective is.
[01:50:02.456 --> 01:50:07.160]  So it's just going to continue and they're just going to keep hitting us from all different angles.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:12.945]  And it's just speeding up, they're speeding up the process.
[01:50:12.945 --> 01:50:13.446]  God bless you.
[01:50:13.446 --> 01:50:16.209]  Any other points, brother?
[01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:20.593]  I would just say, you know, when you first broke the story, Alex, you pointed out Israel
[01:50:21.562 --> 01:50:23.784]  The Israelis pulled a false flag.
[01:50:23.784 --> 01:50:26.306]  So I know you're trying to balance both sides.
[01:50:26.306 --> 01:50:29.208]  You don't want to take a side, and I'm not either.
[01:50:29.208 --> 01:50:36.394]  But they definitely let this happen, just like 9-11 for us.
[01:50:36.394 --> 01:50:38.115]  They initiated it, if you ask me.
[01:50:38.115 --> 01:50:39.597]  Now, I don't know what's right and wrong.
[01:50:39.597 --> 01:50:42.999]  Listen to me very carefully, Brad.
[01:50:42.999 --> 01:50:44.320]  It's a dialectic.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.781]  If we don't see it, we lose.
[01:50:47.314 --> 01:50:48.695]  I agree with what you're saying.
[01:50:48.695 --> 01:50:50.556]  It's not that I'm not trying to take sides.
[01:50:50.556 --> 01:50:53.859]  There's a more powerful globalist group manipulating the whole thing.
[01:50:53.859 --> 01:50:55.000]  We need to see that.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:55.881]  What are we going to do?
[01:50:55.881 --> 01:50:58.283]  Oh, I'm against Israel?
[01:50:58.283 --> 01:51:05.549]  So let's now support the Islamists that are pulling white people out of their cars and beating them up because they're white in Minnesota?
[01:51:05.549 --> 01:51:10.794]  That's what I'm saying is look at what some people... Supporting Israel does nothing anyways.
[01:51:11.754 --> 01:51:13.856]  Israel has its nuclear weapons, all that.
[01:51:13.856 --> 01:51:20.803]  It's that when we sit there and side with Palestine and the Islamists, they've got us because the globalists are bringing them here.
[01:51:20.803 --> 01:51:23.786]  That's their main attack.
[01:51:23.786 --> 01:51:28.171]  Yeah, I agree with you on that, and I'm not picking a side.
[01:51:28.171 --> 01:51:31.694]  It's really hard to fathom at all.
[01:51:31.694 --> 01:51:32.075]  It really is.
[01:51:32.075 --> 01:51:33.376]  Well, I am taking a side.
[01:51:33.376 --> 01:51:35.158]  I want the Islamists to support it.
[01:51:36.823 --> 01:51:40.047]  Well, I want to stop paying Israel all this hush money or whatever money.
[01:51:40.047 --> 01:51:40.668]  Great, great.
[01:51:40.668 --> 01:51:43.392]  Let's take their $3 billion away and let's deport the Islamists.
[01:51:44.611 --> 01:51:46.452]  See, see, I would never debate about that.
[01:51:46.452 --> 01:51:52.817]  The Islamists, there's not 10 million military-age men that are pro-Israel in Europe.
[01:51:52.817 --> 01:51:55.119]  There's not 5 million military-age men in the U.S.
[01:51:55.119 --> 01:51:56.119]  that are pro-Israel.
[01:51:56.119 --> 01:51:57.540]  You understand?
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:03.385]  It is the Islamists that the left is incubating and protecting, and it's nothing to do with the debate about Israel.
[01:52:03.385 --> 01:52:07.387]  What are we going to do about the open borders and the Islamists crawling out of our ass?
[01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:07.968]  What are we going to do?
[01:52:09.332 --> 01:52:09.752]  You're right.
[01:52:09.752 --> 01:52:14.074]  We need to shut down the borders and we need to stop paying all this money to other countries.
[01:52:14.074 --> 01:52:14.994]  I don't care who it is.
[01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:15.595]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:19.736]  Since when did I wake up in the right wing supporting radical Islam?
[01:52:19.736 --> 01:52:22.497]  Because it has something to do with... Israel's not even in this, man!
[01:52:22.497 --> 01:52:25.699]  Our borders are wide open!
[01:52:25.699 --> 01:52:26.779]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:26.779 --> 01:52:31.221]  Again, I don't understand how people don't get multidimensional thinking.
[01:52:31.221 --> 01:52:35.263]  I just... I sit back and I watch this and it makes my blood boil.
[01:52:35.263 --> 01:52:37.224]  And I'm not bitching at the caller.
[01:52:37.224 --> 01:52:37.744]  It's just...
[01:52:39.034 --> 01:52:40.782]  I'm not glad those Jews got killed.
[01:52:40.782 --> 01:52:42.652]  Hezbollah is funded by Joe Biden.
[01:52:43.547 --> 01:52:46.769]  And I'm sad that the Palestinians are getting killed, too.
[01:52:46.769 --> 01:52:52.854]  And they take some clip out of context where I said, well, Israel shouldn't go in, it's a trap, but the only way to go in is to carpet bomb it all.
[01:52:52.854 --> 01:52:54.395]  And they're, oh, Jones does carpet bomb it!
[01:52:54.395 --> 01:52:55.416]  It's a little short clip.
[01:52:55.416 --> 01:53:03.241]  It's the deception, because they want you to join a side for the dialectic of the crisis that then creates the new system they want.
[01:53:03.241 --> 01:53:06.183]  It's Hegelian dialectics!
[01:53:06.183 --> 01:53:09.085]  It's Hegelian dialectics!
[01:53:09.085 --> 01:53:11.127]  It's Hegelian dialectics!
[01:53:12.048 --> 01:53:14.690]  It's a Galean Dialectics.
[01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:21.734]  It's that psychological warfare program, and if you don't get that, you are an idiot.
[01:53:21.734 --> 01:53:25.456]  Mike in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:53:25.456 --> 01:53:26.677]  Hey, Brother Alex, can you hear me?
[01:53:26.677 --> 01:53:28.258]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:28.258 --> 01:53:29.198]  God bless you, Brother Alex.
[01:53:29.198 --> 01:53:31.039]  I've been listening to you since, like, 2003.
[01:53:31.039 --> 01:53:35.142]  I used to think you were totally insane, because of the high school, the Bush rights, the whole thing.
[01:53:35.142 --> 01:53:36.502]  And then I come to realize the last 10, 15 years,
[01:53:38.087 --> 01:53:38.687]  It's incredible.
[01:53:38.687 --> 01:53:41.669]  It's almost like prophecy, but where are the Christians, you said?
[01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:47.252]  I know Christian men who are saying, oh, I'm so mad that we can't put more funds into Ukraine and Russia.
[01:53:47.252 --> 01:53:48.373]  I can't believe what I'm hearing.
[01:53:48.373 --> 01:53:49.434]  This isn't real.
[01:53:49.434 --> 01:53:55.197]  Literally, the Bible is happening before our eyes, and you don't see any Christian church talking about it or warning of anything.
[01:53:55.197 --> 01:53:57.078]  Because the average church is like everybody else.
[01:53:58.829 --> 01:53:59.450]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:25.529 --> 01:54:26.570]  I think of the peacemakers.
[01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:28.811]  So where are the peacemakers is my question, brother.
[01:54:28.811 --> 01:54:36.354]  You know, it's one of those things, the last thing I'll say is this, is that, yes, our attitude, we literally see Israelis dancing in front of 40-foot Buddha statues.
[01:54:36.354 --> 01:54:38.835]  If that is not biblical, what is biblical at this point?
[01:54:38.835 --> 01:54:40.696]  This is biblical proportion.
[01:54:40.696 --> 01:54:41.617]  You're right, it's biblical.
[01:54:41.617 --> 01:54:44.018]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:44.018 --> 01:54:52.022]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, AOC says bring the Gazan refugees here.
[01:54:52.022 --> 01:54:52.062]  No!
[01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:55.983]  In fact, if you want to be anti-Israel, let's do it together!
[01:54:55.983 --> 01:54:57.585]  Here, Israel, no!
[01:54:57.585 --> 01:55:03.793]  You take the Gazans, not us!
[01:55:03.793 --> 01:55:08.300]  But all the anti-Israel folks are in a little kissy face with the Islamists.
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:08.460]  No?
[01:55:09.699 --> 01:55:15.501]  I'm not singing to the Israeli tune, and I sure as hell ain't singing to the Islamic tune.
[01:55:15.501 --> 01:55:16.321]  Ain't it simple?
[01:55:16.321 --> 01:55:20.283]  It's like you're driving by restaurants, and you go, I don't want to eat there, I don't want to eat there.
[01:55:20.283 --> 01:55:25.085]  You're not with either group, and you're like, I don't want that destination.
[01:55:25.085 --> 01:55:26.565]  That's what I'm trying to say here.
[01:55:29.244 --> 01:55:30.425]  I don't want to cut callers off.
[01:55:30.425 --> 01:55:36.672]  We'll go to Daryl, and Gerald, and Carl, and Julio, and Brandon, and Carlos, and Mike, and Taylor.
[01:55:36.672 --> 01:55:39.135]  When we come back, bam, bam, bam, your calls.
[01:55:39.135 --> 01:55:44.321]  Please remember, I'm just trying to get people to think big picture, 35,000 foot view.
[01:55:44.321 --> 01:55:45.802]  I can't run this operation without you.
[01:55:46.443 --> 01:55:48.003]  It's your choice whether to keep us on air.
[01:55:48.003 --> 01:55:49.884]  Plus, you need this in your library.
[01:55:49.884 --> 01:55:51.464]  You need this on your coffee table.
[01:55:51.464 --> 01:55:55.845]  You need this at your barber shop, or your dental office, or your police station, or your library.
[01:55:55.845 --> 01:55:56.745]  Get a bunch of copies.
[01:55:56.745 --> 01:55:58.386]  Amazon.com, lowest price.
[01:55:58.386 --> 01:55:59.326]  Give them to people.
[01:55:59.326 --> 01:55:59.946]  Want to support us?
[01:55:59.946 --> 01:56:01.666]  Get a signed copy as a fundraiser.
[01:56:01.666 --> 01:56:02.986]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:02.986 --> 01:56:03.867]  Get an unsigned copy.
[01:56:03.867 --> 01:56:04.927]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:04.927 --> 01:56:10.308]  The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:56:10.308 --> 01:56:11.568]  The last book was great.
[01:56:11.568 --> 01:56:13.409]  I spent four times more on this one.
[01:56:13.409 --> 01:56:14.249]  It's twice as long.
[01:56:15.191 --> 01:56:18.861]  It's got solutions and the new better world we can build.
[01:56:18.861 --> 01:56:19.904]  It is powerful.

[01:56:50.821 --> 01:56:51.362]  Amazing.
[01:56:51.362 --> 01:56:52.163]  The products work.
[01:56:52.163 --> 01:56:53.184]  They're incredible.
[01:56:53.184 --> 01:56:54.406]  Infowarshore.com.
[01:56:54.406 --> 01:56:55.868]  Got highest quality.

[01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:57.651]  Colloidal silver.

[01:56:59.614 --> 01:57:02.418]  You can buy it at Whole Foods too, but get it from us.
[01:57:02.418 --> 01:57:04.781]  We private label the top firm in the country and it keeps us on air.

[01:57:39.686 --> 01:57:42.789]  InfoOrStore.com.
[01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:44.811]  Hour number three.
[01:57:44.811 --> 01:57:45.232]  Starts now.
[01:57:48.988 --> 01:57:53.030]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:56.612]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:57:56.612 --> 01:58:01.695]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:58:01.695 --> 01:58:04.156]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:58:04.156 --> 01:58:12.741]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:58:12.741 --> 01:58:14.062]  This is the Great Awakening.
[01:58:14.582 --> 01:58:18.966]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:58:18.966 --> 01:58:22.749]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:58:22.749 --> 01:58:25.632]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:50.151]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:58:50.151 --> 01:58:51.091]  I thought it was next week.
[01:58:51.091 --> 01:58:55.514]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[01:58:55.514 --> 01:58:57.756]  Body's Ultimate Temporary Formula.
[01:58:57.756 --> 01:59:01.599]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:59:01.599 --> 01:59:02.399]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:59:03.462 --> 01:59:07.624]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:59:07.624 --> 01:59:10.565]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:59:10.565 --> 01:59:16.427]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoids.
[01:59:16.427 --> 01:59:20.629]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:22.630]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:59:22.630 --> 01:59:27.252]  This is 95%.
[01:59:27.252 --> 01:59:31.154]  Super constant, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:59:32.085 --> 01:59:33.546]  It's that powerful.
[01:59:33.546 --> 01:59:34.707]  Or more!
[01:59:34.707 --> 01:59:38.250]  So they're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:40.812]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:59:40.812 --> 01:59:42.053]  Sold out for almost 8 months.
[01:59:42.053 --> 01:59:50.720]  Back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:56.645]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.273 --> 02:00:07.355]  The big interview with Vivek Ramaswamy.
[02:00:07.355 --> 02:00:09.897]  He did with me a few weeks ago that just aired today.
[02:00:09.897 --> 02:00:11.018]  It's going viral.
[02:00:11.018 --> 02:00:12.620]  We've got more clips of that coming up.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:16.764]  We've got your phone calls.
[02:00:16.764 --> 02:00:19.306]  Owen Schroyer is now, as we speak, reporting to federal prison.
[02:00:19.306 --> 02:00:22.809]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:22.809 --> 02:00:25.371]  Taking them in the order they're received.
[02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:26.873]  Daryl in North Carolina.
[02:00:26.873 --> 02:00:27.473]  You're on the air.
[02:00:27.473 --> 02:00:27.854]  Go ahead.
[02:00:30.051 --> 02:00:40.839]  Hey bud, I just want to let you know I got my five bottles of conspiracy bourbon in the mail and I cracked it open a little while ago and I was wondering if you'd let me do a quick toast to Owen.
[02:00:40.839 --> 02:00:41.179]  Please.
[02:00:41.179 --> 02:00:44.421]  Alright, this is for you Owen.
[02:00:44.421 --> 02:00:46.283]  You left it all on the field.
[02:00:46.283 --> 02:00:51.126]  We'll see you in a couple of months and now here's to the next man up.
[02:00:51.126 --> 02:00:53.127]  Absolutely, I just took a little swig with you.
[02:00:54.042 --> 02:00:55.622]  ConspiracyBourbon.com.
[02:00:55.622 --> 02:00:57.463]  By the way, it's going to sell out in a couple days.
[02:00:57.463 --> 02:00:58.523]  It was just a small run.
[02:00:58.523 --> 02:00:59.463]  It was a test.
[02:00:59.463 --> 02:01:00.904]  It's got an amazing bottle, everything.
[02:01:00.904 --> 02:01:01.624]  You want it, get it.
[02:01:01.624 --> 02:01:03.144]  ConspiracyBourbon.com.
[02:01:03.144 --> 02:01:04.385]  Helps keep us on air.
[02:01:04.385 --> 02:01:07.786]  But the way it works is it's such a good bourbon, like half the cost.
[02:01:07.786 --> 02:01:09.706]  What we sell it for is just the bourbon.
[02:01:09.706 --> 02:01:10.966]  It's not crap.
[02:01:10.966 --> 02:01:14.927]  And then after all the fees and everything, I make like $6 on it.
[02:01:14.927 --> 02:01:16.688]  But yeah, that's definitely a fun thing.
[02:01:17.748 --> 02:01:22.292]  Well, bud, you've had a lot of cool stuff you've come out with, but this is one of my favorites.
[02:01:22.292 --> 02:01:23.313]  And let me tell you, I don't lose my mind.
[02:01:23.313 --> 02:01:24.734]  Well, did you like the Kentucky bourbon?
[02:01:24.734 --> 02:01:26.315]  What'd you think of it?
[02:01:26.315 --> 02:01:27.676]  Oh, dude, it's smooth.
[02:01:27.676 --> 02:01:33.201]  And listen, people gotta know, Kentucky bourbon, it's Kentucky bourbon worldwide for one reason.
[02:01:33.201 --> 02:01:40.207]  They've got limestone that are in those cricks that run through there, and they use the water for the bourbon with that limestone water.
[02:01:40.207 --> 02:01:42.929]  And it's the only place in the world that I know of
[02:01:43.342 --> 02:01:48.927]  Where that limestone water comes from and that's why they say if bourbon ain't bourbon unless it comes from Kentucky.
[02:01:48.927 --> 02:01:53.530]  I mean you go to Asia, Japanese, they'll pay a thousand bucks a bottle for this stuff.
[02:01:53.530 --> 02:01:54.131]  Talk about it.
[02:01:54.131 --> 02:01:58.794]  Kentucky bourbon is the creme de la creme of alcohol around the world.
[02:01:58.794 --> 02:02:04.599]  They wanted to sell it for 200 bucks and I said I want the lowest price so it's 30 bucks for us to get the juice.
[02:02:04.599 --> 02:02:06.921]  So we sell it for 60 something after all the liquor fees.
[02:02:06.921 --> 02:02:08.322]  I make six bucks on it.
[02:02:08.322 --> 02:02:09.023]  Keeps us on air but
[02:02:10.555 --> 02:02:14.717]  I would just let these people license my name, and then they'd shut them down for a year.
[02:02:14.717 --> 02:02:19.220]  So it aged another year in the bottles, and so I said, okay, now I'm going to fully promote this.
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:20.841]  ConspiracyBourbon.com.
[02:02:20.841 --> 02:02:21.741]  People want to get it right now.
[02:02:21.741 --> 02:02:23.722]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:23.722 --> 02:02:29.606]  I'm just telling you, it's super smooth, and people in Kentucky know there's one called Four Roses, and that's like one of the favorites locally.
[02:02:29.606 --> 02:02:32.247]  This one is a little bit better than the Four Roses.
[02:02:32.247 --> 02:02:39.211]  It's smooth, it's got that little bit of oak taste to it, and if you ever go on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail, you learn about the history of bourbon.
[02:02:39.571 --> 02:02:40.091]  You'll get it.
[02:02:40.091 --> 02:02:41.152]  You'll just get it.
[02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.790]  It's awesome.
[02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:13.353]  Hey, in your Vivek interview, it was incredible when you educated him about what happened to you at your trial, what they did, and he had no idea about that little loophole that they're using to go after everybody now.
[02:03:13.353 --> 02:03:16.794]  Giuliani, Trump, they've all been defaulted.
[02:03:16.794 --> 02:03:18.495]  Since when do judges find you guilty?
[02:03:19.975 --> 02:03:20.735]  It's the new thing.
[02:03:20.735 --> 02:03:22.916]  It's the new communist little trick they're playing on us.
[02:03:22.916 --> 02:03:27.438]  So, it's now we've got to focus on our judicial department and these little tricks that they're doing.
[02:03:27.438 --> 02:03:29.498]  We've got to go right back after them.
[02:03:29.498 --> 02:03:29.998]  Right back after them.
[02:03:29.998 --> 02:03:34.080]  Yeah, what did you make of the New York judge in the civil trial saying, I ignore juries.
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:36.101]  I just default people.
[02:03:36.101 --> 02:03:38.761]  I mean, he brags about it.
[02:03:38.761 --> 02:03:40.122]  We're supposed to go along with this?
[02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:44.453]  If they take away the rule of law, all we have is chaos.
[02:03:44.453 --> 02:03:47.475]  This should be number one on the story right now.
[02:03:47.475 --> 02:03:48.917]  Everything should be about people.
[02:03:48.917 --> 02:03:52.600]  We cannot have crooked judges bragging about being crooked.
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.121]  That's it.
[02:03:53.121 --> 02:03:55.763]  It's over if we let this happen.
[02:03:55.763 --> 02:03:56.464]  I totally agree.
[02:03:56.464 --> 02:03:57.364]  We're going to break in one minute.
[02:03:57.364 --> 02:03:59.246]  Anything else, Daryl?
[02:03:59.246 --> 02:03:59.687]  No, sir.
[02:03:59.687 --> 02:04:01.188]  Thank you for this bourbon, brother.
[02:04:02.722 --> 02:04:04.503]  Well, thank you.
[02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:09.527]  You know, again, I just got to the point where they're like, hey, we can get decent bourbon for $15 a bottle.
[02:04:09.527 --> 02:04:10.448]  You'll make a lot more money.
[02:04:10.448 --> 02:04:12.069]  And I said, I like this one.
[02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:16.052]  They said, funny, you just chose the best one we got.
[02:04:16.052 --> 02:04:18.413]  They literally brought me, like, it took a few months.
[02:04:18.413 --> 02:04:19.794]  I tested it out.
[02:04:19.794 --> 02:04:22.977]  And they said, okay, you just picked the most expensive one.
[02:04:22.977 --> 02:04:25.458]  And so we can sell it for $100 a bottle all day long.
[02:04:25.458 --> 02:04:26.979]  It's $60, folks.
[02:04:26.979 --> 02:04:27.880]  And it funds you out.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:28.661]  And I get $6 a bottle.
[02:04:29.994 --> 02:04:33.537]  It actually goes to me to fund the operation, but I saw a lot of bottles and there's only 10,000.
[02:04:33.537 --> 02:04:36.058]  I think they got like 3,000 bottles left.
[02:04:36.058 --> 02:04:37.139]  They'll probably sell it in a day or two.
[02:04:37.139 --> 02:04:40.081]  If you want to get it, conspiracyburba.com.
[02:04:40.081 --> 02:04:42.543]  And yeah, I mean, that's it.
[02:04:42.543 --> 02:04:46.386]  George Washington with Sam Adams, fun of the war with whiskey and beer.
[02:04:46.386 --> 02:04:48.127]  So we're doing it kind of right now.
[02:04:48.127 --> 02:04:53.691]  I think Sam Adams probably got a little more than 5% of the profit though.
[02:04:53.691 --> 02:04:54.731]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:54.731 --> 02:04:55.132]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.045 --> 02:05:03.587]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:05:03.587 --> 02:05:08.749]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:05:08.749 --> 02:05:12.210]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:13.290]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:17.752]  You're watching and listening to InfoWars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[02:05:17.752 --> 02:05:24.374]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[02:05:24.374 --> 02:05:25.555]  And a key tool in that fight
[02:05:26.135 --> 02:05:31.358]  This is the Great Awakening, defeating the Globalists and launching the next Great Renaissance.
[02:05:31.358 --> 02:05:34.999]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and The War for the World.
[02:05:34.999 --> 02:05:38.661]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book.
[02:05:38.661 --> 02:05:43.023]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[02:05:43.023 --> 02:05:47.005]  This is a cultural fight against the Globalists and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:05:47.005 --> 02:05:50.547]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now.
[02:05:50.987 --> 02:05:53.249]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening now!
[02:06:00.416 --> 02:06:07.921]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:19.008]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[02:06:19.008 --> 02:06:25.613]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:06:25.613 --> 02:06:30.096]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:06:36.938 --> 02:06:38.138]  All right.
[02:06:38.138 --> 02:06:40.798]  I'm going to get into World War Three scenarios at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:40.798 --> 02:06:43.159]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:06:43.159 --> 02:06:44.919]  Julio in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:06:44.919 --> 02:06:46.800]  Thank you, sir.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.040]  Oh, thank you, Alejandro.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.240]  Hope you're doing well.
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:49.861]  I'll be quick.
[02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:51.261]  Rapid fire with a bunch of stuff.
[02:06:51.261 --> 02:06:55.082]  A couple of weeks ago, I was in the borderplex in Las Cruces.
[02:06:55.082 --> 02:06:59.163]  For those that don't know, that's Las Cruces, El Paso, and Ciudad Juarez.
[02:06:59.163 --> 02:06:59.923]  And I'll tell you what,
[02:07:00.402 --> 02:07:07.407]  Never in my life have I seen a horde of people literally hitchhiking on the interstate.
[02:07:07.407 --> 02:07:08.908]  Never in my life have I seen that.
[02:07:08.908 --> 02:07:13.271]  Las Cruces is an hour from El Paso, for those who don't know, an hour from Juarez.
[02:07:13.271 --> 02:07:15.253]  So things are getting horrible.
[02:07:15.253 --> 02:07:20.216]  Totally overrun, record levels, total collapse.
[02:07:20.216 --> 02:07:26.281]  And in the current spending bill, there's triple the money for Ukraine's border there is for the U.S.
[02:07:26.281 --> 02:07:26.521]  border.
[02:07:30.492 --> 02:07:31.212]  We're good to go.
[02:08:01.014 --> 02:08:01.875]  I think so.
[02:08:22.202 --> 02:08:29.850]  The Bureau of Central Intelligence already setting up with far-left groups, with some of these international groups.
[02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:33.954]  There's going to be an attack on this country, without a doubt.
[02:08:33.954 --> 02:08:40.221]  And when they engage in the attack, they'll take our rights, and have the media never say why the left bring them in.
[02:08:40.221 --> 02:08:41.922]  And what do you make?
[02:08:42.941 --> 02:08:52.198]  Of the ADL saying white people are inherently evil and pushing all this and now blowing up in their face as the left goes, okay, we'll attack the Jews, then they're white.
[02:08:52.198 --> 02:08:54.382]  I mean, this is very, very cut and dry now.
[02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:56.550]  Yeah, I mentioned this a few months ago.
[02:08:56.550 --> 02:09:01.911]  It's almost like a desperate person at the roulette table at some type of gambling hall.
[02:09:01.911 --> 02:09:03.312]  They're going all in.
[02:09:03.312 --> 02:09:05.292]  They know that it's almost chasing.
[02:09:05.292 --> 02:09:09.453]  They're chasing what's next, even though they know it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:09:09.453 --> 02:09:12.774]  Now, speaking of Chicago, Alex, I was visiting family.
[02:09:12.774 --> 02:09:21.915]  Almost every person of my family and my wife's family was already... Sorry, your phone just broke up.
[02:09:21.915 --> 02:09:22.896]  Hold on.
[02:09:22.896 --> 02:09:24.316]  Almost every member of your family, what?
[02:09:25.598 --> 02:09:32.742]  Every member of my family, from my wife and my side, who are millennials, are dealing with fertility issues.
[02:09:32.742 --> 02:09:35.644]  And these are people who took the COVID vaccine.
[02:09:35.644 --> 02:09:37.565]  Stillbirth.
[02:09:37.565 --> 02:09:39.286]  Going through IVF treatment.
[02:09:39.286 --> 02:09:43.909]  X, Y, Z. Alex, it is... And then meanwhile they bring in the third world replacements.
[02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:44.469]  Absolutely.
[02:09:44.469 --> 02:09:45.810]  God bless you, Leo.
[02:09:45.810 --> 02:09:46.271]  It's real.
[02:09:46.271 --> 02:09:48.692]  We're living in a bio-weapon attack.
[02:09:48.692 --> 02:09:50.353]  We're all veterans of a bio-war.
[02:09:50.353 --> 02:09:51.794]  I mean, it's true.
[02:09:52.779 --> 02:09:53.859]  We have the VFW Hall.
[02:09:53.859 --> 02:09:54.859]  We honor the veterans great.
[02:09:54.859 --> 02:09:56.420]  They're great people.
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:57.360]  On average, I love veterans.
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:59.520]  They're some of the best people out there.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:07.882]  But we're all victims of the New World Order globalist attack, and you need to realize that and understand that if there's any hope.
[02:10:07.882 --> 02:10:09.642]  Brandon in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:10:09.642 --> 02:10:11.482]  Thanks for holding.
[02:10:11.482 --> 02:10:12.963]  This is Randy.
[02:10:12.963 --> 02:10:14.183]  I'm sorry, Randy.
[02:10:14.183 --> 02:10:14.663]  Go ahead.
[02:10:14.663 --> 02:10:15.663]  That's all right, Alex.
[02:10:15.663 --> 02:10:17.404]  Hell, people call me a whole lot worse.
[02:10:17.404 --> 02:10:19.064]  Yeah, they put Brandon on screen, but whatever.
[02:10:19.064 --> 02:10:19.584]  Go ahead, Randy.
[02:10:20.598 --> 02:10:26.983]  Last time I saw you, I was pushing you over that ladder there at Barton Springs when we had that mask rally deal.
[02:10:26.983 --> 02:10:34.950]  Yeah, back when they were shutting down the parks and the corporate media said it was a lie and I hired crisis actors.
[02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:36.551]  No one was shutting down parks.
[02:10:36.551 --> 02:10:41.155]  Though they were, the national media said I made it up.
[02:10:41.155 --> 02:10:42.316]  Yeah, we went down there.
[02:10:42.316 --> 02:10:43.577]  Remember, we had a blast.
[02:10:43.577 --> 02:10:44.998]  Owen was there with us.
[02:10:44.998 --> 02:10:47.039]  Anyway, let me get to the point here.
[02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:47.600]  Do you got my 5x5?
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:47.800]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:49.577 --> 02:10:52.398]  Okay.
[02:10:52.398 --> 02:11:06.565]  I am starting a deal called the University of Paul Revere, and the professors, if you will, are going to be you, Bannon, Mel Kaye, and John B. Wells, and guests that are constitutionalists, and we know that they are.
[02:11:06.565 --> 02:11:08.226]  And so that's going to be starting very soon.
[02:11:08.226 --> 02:11:09.547]  I hadn't launched it as of yet.
[02:11:09.547 --> 02:11:10.567]  I wanted to get with you.
[02:11:10.567 --> 02:11:18.771]  I went up to CPAC to see Steve up there last year, and the week after we fixed the launch, really I wasn't
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:26.202]  We got busted, if you remember, they arrested Miles, so we backed off for a while.
[02:11:26.202 --> 02:11:31.624]  The students are going to be entered into a book called The Next Greatest Generation, Silent Majority.
[02:11:31.624 --> 02:11:38.006]  So we're going to let everybody that joins the university, they're not going to do anything, Alex, and you and I both know this, unless there's something in it for them.
[02:11:38.006 --> 02:11:41.147]  That's what the American people are conditioned that way.
[02:11:41.147 --> 02:11:43.308]  So we're going to Eddie McGuire it.
[02:11:43.308 --> 02:11:48.050]  I will pay, or the university will pay, people to go out and just tell their stories, their
[02:11:48.897 --> 02:11:51.579]  If they love this country, for God's sake, Alex.
[02:11:51.579 --> 02:11:52.959]  I'm going to start here in Texas.
[02:11:52.959 --> 02:11:55.201]  I've talked to three sheriffs around my area.
[02:11:55.201 --> 02:11:56.321]  They're behind me.
[02:11:56.321 --> 02:12:00.303]  We're going to have little meetings like they did with Amway and people's houses.
[02:12:00.303 --> 02:12:01.444]  And so it's private.
[02:12:02.051 --> 02:12:10.614]  And I'm going to go to every single county in the state of Texas that I can, and we're going to start in Texas, but I'll also be training people in other parts of the country to do the same thing.
[02:12:10.614 --> 02:12:12.014]  If we don't, we're going to lose this thing.
[02:12:12.014 --> 02:12:14.875]  We've got until November of next year.
[02:12:14.875 --> 02:12:15.635]  No, you're damn right.
[02:12:15.635 --> 02:12:18.036]  So give us a website or how do we contact you, Randy?
[02:12:18.036 --> 02:12:19.856]  No, just you got my phone there, Alex.
[02:12:19.856 --> 02:12:20.857]  I need to talk to you.
[02:12:20.857 --> 02:12:22.417]  There's certain things about it.
[02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:27.472]  That I think that you would agree that we don't want to broadcast that over the airwaves.
[02:12:27.472 --> 02:12:32.834]  Oh, Randy, I'm a little, I'm a busier and a one-legged man in asking contests, but I appreciate it.
[02:12:32.834 --> 02:12:33.995]  Well, Trump, let me get you on as a guest.
[02:12:33.995 --> 02:12:34.315]  Thank you.
[02:12:34.315 --> 02:12:36.276]  Give us a number.
[02:12:36.276 --> 02:12:44.819]  But you remind me of over three years ago, they had lockdowns and they shut down the parks and they shut down the pools and they shut it all down.
[02:12:44.819 --> 02:12:46.520]  They got, for those who don't know, we got this big
[02:12:47.901 --> 02:12:56.986]  Dammed up spring that's like 300, 400 yards long called Martin Springs off the Colorado River.
[02:12:56.986 --> 02:13:02.089]  And I tried to go down there and just swim in the river with my kids.
[02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:03.309]  They still live with me then.
[02:13:03.309 --> 02:13:06.251]  They're all grown up now, except for one of them.
[02:13:06.251 --> 02:13:09.072]  And the cops come over and said, you can't be here swimming.
[02:13:09.072 --> 02:13:10.553]  And I told them I'm going to still swim.
[02:13:10.553 --> 02:13:11.414]  They threatened to arrest me.
[02:13:11.414 --> 02:13:13.915]  And then they backed off.
[02:13:13.915 --> 02:13:15.316]  So I said, we're coming down there.
[02:13:15.316 --> 02:13:17.317]  And then the national news said
[02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:19.590]  They didn't close that.
[02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:20.871]  Jones has made it up.
[02:13:20.871 --> 02:13:24.112]  They want to give us a victory of us climbing over and taking it over.
[02:13:24.112 --> 02:13:27.914]  And then even the city the next week reopened it.
[02:13:27.914 --> 02:13:31.975]  Because they're so scared of giving you power to admit we overrode them.
[02:13:31.975 --> 02:13:33.216]  They just said no.
[02:13:33.216 --> 02:13:36.437]  It's actually about fat ass climbing over the fence.
[02:13:36.437 --> 02:13:39.638]  So.
[02:13:39.638 --> 02:13:41.899]  This year they reenacted it and said why did I go?
[02:13:41.899 --> 02:13:43.680]  I said we already won that fight.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:46.181]  I'm moving on here.
[02:13:46.181 --> 02:13:46.381]  So.
[02:13:48.308 --> 02:13:51.970]  That's a big deal.
[02:13:51.970 --> 02:13:55.872]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Carlos in Canada, then Mike in Ohio.
[02:13:55.872 --> 02:13:58.713]  Carlos, welcome.
[02:13:58.713 --> 02:14:02.815]  Alex, viene la tormenta!
[02:14:02.815 --> 02:14:04.176]  What does that mean in Spanish?
[02:14:04.176 --> 02:14:05.736]  Torment?
[02:14:05.736 --> 02:14:10.358]  Viene la tormenta means the storm is coming.
[02:14:10.358 --> 02:14:13.560]  It means the atomic war is coming.
[02:14:14.002 --> 02:14:16.023]  As of the movie, The Terminator.
[02:14:16.023 --> 02:14:22.886]  Yeah, guys, pull up the end of Terminator, the first one, where Sarah Connor says she's about to go to Mexico, get ready for the war.
[02:14:22.886 --> 02:14:24.406]  She says a storm is coming.
[02:14:24.406 --> 02:14:25.267]  Pull that up.
[02:14:25.267 --> 02:14:26.547]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[02:14:26.547 --> 02:14:33.690]  And the little kid says, viene la tormenta, because the nuclear detonation has already taken place.
[02:14:33.690 --> 02:14:36.171]  What am I saying is that it's very dangerous, Alex.
[02:14:36.171 --> 02:14:42.994]  You know, you park two basically navies just outside of
[02:14:44.132 --> 02:14:56.902]  I was about to say, will Israel pull another USS Liberty and blow up, because they've done it before.
[02:14:56.902 --> 02:14:58.843]  I'm not attacking Israel, it's just true.
[02:14:58.843 --> 02:14:59.884]  It's all declassified.
[02:14:59.884 --> 02:15:03.286]  I've interviewed the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Admiral Moore, before he died.
[02:15:03.286 --> 02:15:04.367]  They got the calls.
[02:15:04.367 --> 02:15:07.869]  LBJ said, sink the ship, let them sink it, as a pretext.
[02:15:07.869 --> 02:15:08.310]  You're right.
[02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:12.553]  Will another government or another group form a false flag?
[02:15:13.536 --> 02:15:23.923]  Well, the Russians moved the Kinzhal missiles to the Black Sea, so, you know, you could easily blame it on the Russians attacking the navies, okay?
[02:15:23.923 --> 02:15:30.187]  But the point is... And despite what that means, because Putin said 1,000 kilometer, he was saying more than 1,000.
[02:15:30.187 --> 02:15:31.888]  No, it's actually 1,200 mile an hour.
[02:15:31.888 --> 02:15:32.849]  So that's like 1,600 kilometer.
[02:15:32.849 --> 02:15:33.869]  They could hit the ships in minutes.
[02:15:38.232 --> 02:15:41.354]  And he's loaded nuclear weapons on aircraft in the region.
[02:15:41.354 --> 02:15:44.915]  And he said this isn't a threat, it's a message from the Russian Air Force.
[02:15:44.915 --> 02:15:45.656]  What does that mean?
[02:15:45.656 --> 02:15:48.077]  Because Putin isn't one for threats.
[02:15:48.077 --> 02:15:53.120]  No, and the danger, of course, is that the escalation will be very, very rapid.
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:16:01.524]  Because, as it stands right now, since 1967, and with all respect to all parties concerned, okay?
[02:16:01.524 --> 02:16:07.787]  Since 1967, Israel has been an occupier of Palestinian territory, and it has denied
[02:16:08.271 --> 02:16:14.676]  Every opportunity to withdraw and to allow the, you know, the peace process.
[02:16:14.676 --> 02:16:16.618]  It did in Gaza, but look what happened.
[02:16:16.618 --> 02:16:21.061]  It was basically really a false withdrawal.
[02:16:21.061 --> 02:16:23.743]  Well, yeah, they put Hamas in, in their own words.
[02:16:23.743 --> 02:16:28.527]  I'm not attacking Israel, it's just true, to destabilize the PLO.
[02:16:28.527 --> 02:16:28.967]  Right.
[02:16:28.967 --> 02:16:29.408]  And then in 1999,
[02:16:31.792 --> 02:16:35.896]  British gas discovered gas fields just off Palestine.
[02:16:35.896 --> 02:16:36.517]  Huge!
[02:16:36.517 --> 02:16:48.449]  In the year 2000, it was announced that they had over 1.3 trillion square meters or whatever of natural gas, which connected to those fields that Israel had discovered, the Leviathan.
[02:16:48.897 --> 02:16:55.041]  Which were part of the, you know, Levantine formation that extends all the way to Lebanon.
[02:16:55.041 --> 02:16:59.924]  And then a year later, it was like, oh, the Hamas started Cast Lead, you know?
[02:16:59.924 --> 02:17:04.847]  Cast Lead, which was a major invasion of Gaza, and many people died.
[02:17:04.847 --> 02:17:10.751]  And you know, this time around, when gas, LNG gas, is being shipped from Israel to Egypt,
[02:17:12.532 --> 02:17:18.897]  Isn't it coincidental that we have Gaza again now being ethnically cleansed, possibly annexed?
[02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:19.397]  Sure, sure.
[02:17:19.397 --> 02:17:21.999]  But Carlos, let's cut to the chase.
[02:17:21.999 --> 02:17:26.322]  Hezbollah still launched the attack after they got the money.
[02:17:26.322 --> 02:17:28.343]  I think they're a major global player.
[02:17:28.343 --> 02:17:30.505]  Their leadership is working behind the scenes with the globalists.
[02:17:32.008 --> 02:17:42.074]  Would it hurt the world, do you think, if Israel was just to simply withdraw from all of Gaza and the West Bank as the United Nations told them to do in Resolution 222, I believe?
[02:17:42.074 --> 02:17:45.516]  Well, the problem is Hezbollah that's in control, but the globalists will keep launching rockets.
[02:17:46.553 --> 02:17:51.838]  Yes, and at that point, that's when the world will be on the side of Israel 100%.
[02:17:51.838 --> 02:17:55.241]  Because Israel has the right to defend itself when it's being attacked.
[02:17:55.241 --> 02:17:56.782]  No debate, okay?
[02:17:56.782 --> 02:18:01.687]  But when Israel is in occupation of other people's territory, like in Lebanon, the
[02:18:02.727 --> 02:18:11.350]  I agree with you, but Carlos, how do we deal with the left bringing Muslims in and radicalizing them all over Europe and here?
[02:18:11.350 --> 02:18:17.772]  The left is embracing the anti-Israel deal, obviously for a dialectic of a collision, how do we stop that?
[02:18:18.607 --> 02:18:31.999]  Well, you stop it by looking at President Trump, when he visited the World Economic Forum, across the street, there was a hotel, and George Soros was then arranging to bring down not only the President, but to get everybody dressed up.
[02:18:31.999 --> 02:18:36.704]  And that's why they hate Trump so much, because he actually brought peace and the Abraham Accords.
[02:18:36.704 --> 02:18:37.404]  That's right.
[02:18:37.404 --> 02:18:38.946]  And it was George Soros.
[02:18:40.350 --> 02:18:44.413]  Because Trump's like, hey, North Korea, build hotels and casinos, stop it!
[02:18:44.413 --> 02:18:45.314]  And China blocks it.
[02:18:45.314 --> 02:18:49.056]  Trump's just like, why are we having tyranny when freedom works so much better?
[02:18:49.056 --> 02:18:52.278]  He literally is an optimist and they can't stand that.
[02:18:52.278 --> 02:18:55.681]  John F. Kennedy was the president, a man of peace.
[02:18:55.681 --> 02:18:57.242]  Trump was a man of peace.
[02:18:57.242 --> 02:18:59.644]  Men of peace, like Omar Sadat.
[02:18:59.644 --> 02:19:03.306]  Men of peace don't survive long when people are interested only in one thing.
[02:19:03.306 --> 02:19:08.390]  You just bingo to tell folks about the Egyptian president that made a real deal and that killed his ass.
[02:19:08.390 --> 02:19:09.771]  I mean, we know the CIA was involved.
[02:19:10.834 --> 02:19:15.278]  Well, Omar Sadat's brother-in-law I actually met in Geneva.
[02:19:15.278 --> 02:19:17.680]  I had a long afternoon conversation with him.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:23.364]  He was a financier and, you know, he was a major, direct descendant from
[02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:34.733]  The Prophet Muhammad, he wears the gold braid, you know, over the white cloth, which is a very indicator that he's a descendant of the Prophet.
[02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:37.834]  So, what I wanted to tell you, Evan, is this.
[02:19:37.834 --> 02:19:48.478]  If you have a man of peace in the White House who wants the world to become progressive, then you're saying, delegate the resources of Africa to the Africans.
[02:19:48.928 --> 02:19:49.168]  That's
[02:20:07.239 --> 02:20:07.660]  I think so.
[02:20:25.595 --> 02:20:31.580]  We need a human lobby for just basic human rights, no matter what religion or group you are.
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:32.741]  We have a basic code.
[02:20:32.741 --> 02:20:33.542]  We team together.
[02:20:33.542 --> 02:20:34.062]  That's the future.
[02:20:34.062 --> 02:20:35.684]  Carlos, 30-second closing comment.
[02:20:54.838 --> 02:20:57.681]  The closing comment is this.
[02:20:57.681 --> 02:20:58.842]  Take care of your children.
[02:20:58.842 --> 02:21:01.825]  Develop them to their fullest potential as human beings.
[02:21:01.825 --> 02:21:04.548]  And your country will be there forever.
[02:21:04.548 --> 02:21:05.709]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:21:05.709 --> 02:21:06.790]  Clearly.
[02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:08.512]  Leave the children alone.
[02:21:08.512 --> 02:21:09.173]  Okay?
[02:21:09.173 --> 02:21:10.614]  Don't touch the children.
[02:21:10.614 --> 02:21:12.856]  Bring them to their full human potential.
[02:21:12.856 --> 02:21:14.678]  Regardless of where you are in this world.
[02:21:14.678 --> 02:21:16.380]  And you're going to see a better world.
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:17.221]  And a peaceful world.
[02:21:20.422 --> 02:21:22.042]  I totally agree with you.
[02:21:22.042 --> 02:21:27.524]  I want a pro-human future for black, brown, and white, Christian, Muslim, Jew.
[02:21:27.524 --> 02:21:30.824]  And we've got to transcend it and admit the facts of what's happening.
[02:21:30.824 --> 02:21:36.926]  Since you mentioned the end of Terminator, the original, with Sarah Connor saying, a storm is coming.
[02:21:36.926 --> 02:21:38.086]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:38.086 --> 02:21:39.166]  We'll come back with your phone calls.
[02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:52.532]  What did he just say?
[02:21:52.532 --> 02:21:59.677]  He said there's a storm coming.
[02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:08.624]  I know.
[02:22:08.624 --> 02:22:16.410]  Now that's where we are right now, folks.
[02:22:16.410 --> 02:22:17.551]  You can feel it in your bones.
[02:22:19.113 --> 02:22:23.475]  Evil is taking over right now.
[02:22:23.475 --> 02:22:25.557]  Carlos, thanks for the call.
[02:22:25.557 --> 02:22:29.138]  I want to get to nuclear war scenarios coming up next segment.
[02:22:29.138 --> 02:22:31.760]  We'll finish up the other callers, but right now let's go back to your calls.
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:33.201]  Mike in Ohio, thanks for calling.
[02:22:33.201 --> 02:22:33.741]  You're on the air.
[02:22:33.741 --> 02:22:35.482]  Go ahead.
[02:22:35.482 --> 02:22:37.443]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:22:37.443 --> 02:22:38.283]  God bless you, man.
[02:22:38.283 --> 02:22:40.364]  God bless the crew.
[02:22:40.364 --> 02:22:45.187]  God's been heavy on my heart to call you lately and try and lay down a plan.
[02:22:45.187 --> 02:22:46.968]  It might not be much of a plan, but
[02:22:47.717 --> 02:22:50.659]  Um, you know, the American people in general have become lazy.
[02:22:50.659 --> 02:22:51.780]  Nobody wants to do anything.
[02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:54.681]  Write politicians, call politicians, whatever.
[02:22:54.681 --> 02:22:58.964]  So, you know... The Western world is asleep.
[02:22:58.964 --> 02:22:59.524]  They are.
[02:22:59.524 --> 02:23:00.145]  They are.
[02:23:00.145 --> 02:23:07.309]  And, you know, you've covered that directly on everything from the chemical contamination to everything, the dumbing down in college.
[02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:11.411]  But regardless, what we need to do is a peaceful protest.
[02:23:11.411 --> 02:23:13.913]  A lot of good came from sit-in protest.
[02:23:13.913 --> 02:23:17.095]  And the American people can easily sit at home
[02:23:17.595 --> 02:23:20.918]  Just blue-collar America runs this country.
[02:23:20.918 --> 02:23:22.059]  I'm an electrician.
[02:23:22.059 --> 02:23:24.180]  I know tons of people in the trade.
[02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:36.971]  If we just pick a day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, whatever, and just you, Jack Posobiec, Tucker, Joe Rogan, Steve Bannon, Crowder, Clay Clark, your reach is so far and wide.
[02:23:36.971 --> 02:23:40.834]  I hear you're trying to organize those guys like organized cats, and I've talked to some of them today.
[02:23:41.354 --> 02:23:43.794]  But regardless, every day, hammer out links.
[02:23:43.794 --> 02:23:45.315]  Every day, protest.
[02:23:45.315 --> 02:23:46.895]  Every day, go to city council.
[02:23:46.895 --> 02:23:55.816]  Every day, go to... Think how the left was so scared of people going to school board meetings and saying, don't teach my white kid, when they're five, they're bad because they're white.
[02:23:55.816 --> 02:23:57.857]  They're little innocent kids that love everybody.
[02:23:57.857 --> 02:24:01.077]  Like my six-year-old daughter loves black people, brown people, white people.
[02:24:01.077 --> 02:24:04.338]  And they're literally... I thought I was protecting her home school.
[02:24:04.338 --> 02:24:07.218]  We sent her to some sports camp and they brainwashed her there.
[02:24:07.218 --> 02:24:08.419]  She was bad because she was white.
[02:24:08.419 --> 02:24:10.219]  She said, am I bad to me last week?
[02:24:10.839 --> 02:24:16.123]  And I got so angry, and that's when I said, okay, I'm done.
[02:24:16.123 --> 02:24:19.565]  Because this is outrageous.
[02:24:19.565 --> 02:24:21.306]  It is, and I know time's short.
[02:24:21.306 --> 02:24:26.670]  We don't have much time to correct anything, but let's hit these globalists in the wallet where it hurts.
[02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:27.651]  Well, we've done it.
[02:24:27.651 --> 02:24:30.172]  BlackRock's lost trillions.
[02:24:30.172 --> 02:24:32.934]  The New World Order's getting the living hell beat out of it.
[02:24:32.934 --> 02:24:34.075]  We're actually winning, brother.
[02:24:34.075 --> 02:24:35.016]  That's why they're freaking out.
[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:39.582]  Amen, amen, but let's take it to the next level.
[02:24:39.582 --> 02:24:41.024]  Let's show them our numbers.
[02:24:41.024 --> 02:24:45.987]  How dare you tell my six-year-old she's white!
[02:24:45.987 --> 02:24:51.171]  I mean, God, the ADL and the left, they're just so evil!
[02:24:51.171 --> 02:24:53.373]  Wrecking children's innocence!
[02:24:53.373 --> 02:24:55.414]  And trying to cut their genitals off!
[02:24:55.414 --> 02:24:58.316]  I mean, just... Man, that's evil!
[02:24:58.316 --> 02:24:59.097]  Man, that's bad!
[02:25:00.285 --> 02:25:06.411]  We go to a rural school in Ohio and my daughter actually had to change schools because of the wokeness.
[02:25:06.411 --> 02:25:18.822]  And she's a lesbian student and was going into her senior year, had been there since kindergarten, and changed to a city school that is not as woke, not as indoctrinated.
[02:25:19.446 --> 02:25:23.209]  And, you know, the issues reach far and wide.
[02:25:23.209 --> 02:25:23.750]  They do.
[02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:37.001]  But that's why I say, you know, if we can have a peaceful protest and the people just stay at home, don't spend money, you know, take to the airwaves, take to the telegram, whatever, and voice why you're doing this.
[02:25:37.001 --> 02:25:40.424]  Spend money on the liberty organizations.
[02:25:40.424 --> 02:25:41.925]  Don't spend money with the globalists.
[02:25:41.925 --> 02:25:42.606]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:42.606 --> 02:25:47.690]  Folks, they're going to take your confused children and tell them they're a lesbian.
[02:25:51.107 --> 02:25:56.091]  Because as a young girl, they're upset about their relationship with boys because that's the normal friction.
[02:25:56.091 --> 02:25:57.412]  And they're going to do that.
[02:25:57.412 --> 02:25:59.533]  You're not a lesbian.
[02:25:59.533 --> 02:26:01.574]  You're a woman.
[02:26:01.574 --> 02:26:05.677]  And your office is incredible, creating the future of humanity.
[02:26:05.677 --> 02:26:07.218]  They're doing this to make you not have children.
[02:26:07.218 --> 02:26:09.280]  I don't blame women that like women.
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.802]  It's the old joke, you know, my spirit animal's a lesbian.
[02:26:12.641 --> 02:26:14.322]  I'm not attacking women.
[02:26:14.322 --> 02:26:15.683]  They're attracted to women.
[02:26:15.683 --> 02:26:19.906]  I'm telling you that your final form is with a man.
[02:26:19.906 --> 02:26:21.907]  And I know there's not a bunch of men out there.
[02:26:21.907 --> 02:26:23.649]  I totally get it.
[02:26:23.649 --> 02:26:28.752]  And believe me, all I do is hang out with my wife and my mother and my daughters.
[02:26:28.752 --> 02:26:29.472]  My son's great.
[02:26:29.472 --> 02:26:31.033]  I love them to death.
[02:26:31.033 --> 02:26:34.076]  I want to be around women all day long.
[02:26:34.076 --> 02:26:35.376]  I'm all about women.
[02:26:35.376 --> 02:26:36.217]  I just feel good.
[02:26:36.217 --> 02:26:36.837]  I like women.
[02:26:36.837 --> 02:26:39.639]  I want women.
[02:26:39.639 --> 02:26:41.340]  And so to tell other women, hey,
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:53.048]  The point is, is that this is an attack, and it's an admitted plan, so that you don't step in the office to make a new creature.
[02:26:53.048 --> 02:26:55.249]  And that's what I'm telling you, is I'm not judging you.
[02:26:55.249 --> 02:26:56.630]  I've killed my children.
[02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:58.492]  I didn't realize when I was doing it, what it was.
[02:26:58.492 --> 02:26:59.713]  I repented later.
[02:26:59.713 --> 02:27:03.336]  But, you know, I'm not judging you as a, quote, lesbian.
[02:27:03.336 --> 02:27:06.198]  I'm just simply telling you, you know you're not fulfilled by that.
[02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:09.992]  And I'm sorry there's not men out there that can measure up.
[02:27:09.992 --> 02:27:10.773]  I get it.
[02:27:10.773 --> 02:27:11.954]  I'm not judging you.
[02:27:11.954 --> 02:27:13.895]  I've killed my children.
[02:27:13.895 --> 02:27:16.197]  I'm way worse than you.
[02:27:16.197 --> 02:27:23.943]  But I will tell you, you're on a destructive path that is not of the plan.
[02:27:23.943 --> 02:27:27.586]  And it's only when you get with the plan that you're empowered.
[02:27:27.586 --> 02:27:29.687]  And people ask me, like, Jones, why do you bash yourself?
[02:27:29.687 --> 02:27:30.368]  Why do you admit that?
[02:27:30.368 --> 02:27:35.451]  I've had families say, why the hell do you admit every week you were involved in abortions?
[02:27:35.451 --> 02:27:35.812]  Because
[02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:40.291]  This is not an insurmountable thing we're doing here.
[02:27:40.291 --> 02:27:41.131]  I'm a sinner.
[02:27:41.131 --> 02:27:41.872]  I'm wrong.
[02:27:41.872 --> 02:27:43.133]  I've done bad things.
[02:27:43.133 --> 02:27:44.273]  Yeah, I wasn't conscious.
[02:27:44.273 --> 02:27:45.134]  Yes, I didn't want it.
[02:27:45.134 --> 02:27:46.855]  I didn't realize what I was doing.
[02:27:46.855 --> 02:27:47.435]  It doesn't matter.
[02:27:47.435 --> 02:27:49.937]  I'm not going to dodge it.
[02:27:49.937 --> 02:27:58.262]  I have to admit what I've done so you can understand that you're forgiven for stuff far less worse than I've done.
[02:27:58.262 --> 02:27:59.243]  And that's how God works.
[02:27:59.243 --> 02:28:00.884]  If you say, I'm sorry.
[02:28:00.884 --> 02:28:02.545]  What do I do to make this better?
[02:28:02.545 --> 02:28:06.648]  God's going to put you into the war and God's going to do incredible things with you.
[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:16.044]  But I say to women out there that have been taught to hate men and men that have been taught to hate women and well that's a whole nother thing.
[02:28:16.044 --> 02:28:22.788]  Men act like a bunch of babies and are selfish and all of it and I get it.
[02:28:22.788 --> 02:28:28.570]  I'm just simply saying we're dying as a species and Elon Musk is right.
[02:28:28.570 --> 02:28:33.693]  We need to re-energize our population and we need to realize in all the animal kingdom
[02:28:35.469 --> 02:28:38.632]  There's male and female, and that's why they're attacking it.
[02:28:38.632 --> 02:28:47.419]  Because there's power in that, and there is a intergalactic ritual, the highest levels that happens when a man and woman come together and create that new being.
[02:28:47.419 --> 02:28:52.904]  So they dumb it down, they lie about it, they attack it because they fear the Genesis Project.
[02:28:52.904 --> 02:28:54.586]  And we are the Genesis Project.
[02:29:00.302 --> 02:29:02.543]  Last year we put this book out.
[02:29:02.543 --> 02:29:03.964]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:29:03.964 --> 02:29:06.344]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:29:06.344 --> 02:29:10.126]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:29:10.126 --> 02:29:11.106]  The Great Awakening.
[02:29:11.106 --> 02:29:15.368]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:29:15.368 --> 02:29:17.409]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:29:17.409 --> 02:29:19.110]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[02:29:19.770 --> 02:29:20.230]  We're good to go.
[02:29:38.908 --> 02:29:46.672]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.

[02:29:55.957 --> 02:29:57.018]  It's a powerful book.

[02:31:57.924 --> 02:32:02.628]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.

[02:32:04.609 --> 02:32:06.650]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:09.132]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:32:09.132 --> 02:32:09.933]  Hey, what's better?
[02:32:09.933 --> 02:32:10.794]  Knockout?
[02:32:10.794 --> 02:32:12.135]  What's better?
[02:32:12.135 --> 02:32:12.875]  Down and out?
[02:32:12.875 --> 02:32:13.415]  What's better?
[02:32:13.415 --> 02:32:15.677]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:32:15.677 --> 02:32:20.601]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:32:21.281 --> 02:32:25.262]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:32:25.262 --> 02:32:26.563]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:32:26.563 --> 02:32:27.903]  They're all very diverse.
[02:32:27.903 --> 02:32:38.066]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[02:32:59.357 --> 02:33:05.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.665 --> 02:33:19.250]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:23.714]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:23.714 --> 02:33:30.800]  We now take you live.
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:39.267]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:44.970 --> 02:33:52.413]  There are 8 million souls on spaceship Earth orbiting our standard yellow sun.
[02:33:52.413 --> 02:33:58.035]  World War III has already begun.
[02:33:58.035 --> 02:33:59.415]  We're at war with Russia.
[02:33:59.415 --> 02:34:00.736]  We're now at war with Islam.
[02:34:00.736 --> 02:34:03.017]  All our borders are wide open.
[02:34:03.017 --> 02:34:04.037]  Israel is overrun.
[02:34:05.407 --> 02:34:21.382]  And all it takes is for Iran to invade from the north of Lebanon into Israel and activate Hezbollah units in the West Bank and Hezbollah units in Gaza for Israel to use nuclear weapons on Iran and they've said they will.
[02:34:21.382 --> 02:34:22.223]  We're now here.
[02:34:23.547 --> 02:34:27.469]  You can pick who's bad or who's good, but why did all this start now?
[02:34:27.469 --> 02:34:39.756]  Because the world is coming to the end of the reserve currency and bringing in their new global currency, their new Mark of the Basin.
[02:34:39.756 --> 02:34:41.017]  So how does a war start?
[02:34:41.017 --> 02:34:50.002]  What are the different scenarios?
[02:34:50.002 --> 02:34:52.484]  Missiles get launched at US aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean.
[02:34:54.076 --> 02:34:58.197]  And they think they're hypersonic missiles, so they fire missiles at those.
[02:34:58.197 --> 02:35:00.038]  The Russians think they're nuclear-tipped missiles.
[02:35:00.038 --> 02:35:01.278]  They've said they'll attack.
[02:35:01.278 --> 02:35:06.940]  They launch aircraft, launch cruise missiles that are Mach 12.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:10.081]  That's their real speed.
[02:35:10.081 --> 02:35:12.281]  At the aircraft carrier, there's no way to stop it.
[02:35:12.281 --> 02:35:14.682]  Boom, it starts.
[02:35:14.682 --> 02:35:17.723]  And the Russians lost a third of their population in World War II.
[02:35:17.723 --> 02:35:21.124]  They've got it in their cultural DNA to go to war.
[02:35:22.093 --> 02:35:23.594]  They expect it.
[02:35:23.594 --> 02:35:26.815]  They're ready for it.
[02:35:26.815 --> 02:35:30.377]  We thought the Cold War was over with Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.
[02:35:30.377 --> 02:35:40.042]  It's back with Joe Biden at the beach, stumbling around, not knowing who he is, and clowns of the U.S.
[02:35:40.042 --> 02:35:42.163]  Press Secretary.
[02:35:42.163 --> 02:35:49.567]  It's all meant to encourage China to go into Taiwan, to encourage Russia to expand their operations, and to encourage
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:54.381]  Iran that runs Hezbollah to launch attacks.
[02:35:54.381 --> 02:35:54.942]  And the U.S.
[02:35:54.942 --> 02:35:55.962]  is evacuating U.S.
[02:35:55.962 --> 02:35:59.684]  citizens out of the Middle East right now.
[02:35:59.684 --> 02:36:07.286]  And you turn on the news and the White House precursor says, I don't care about Jews getting killed.
[02:36:07.286 --> 02:36:09.007]  Muslims are the most persecuted.
[02:36:09.007 --> 02:36:09.667]  The U.N.
[02:36:09.667 --> 02:36:16.810]  admits 80% of global persecution is against Christians.
[02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:18.611]  And I don't want Muslims to get persecuted.
[02:36:20.472 --> 02:36:27.555]  But the fact is Christians are being murdered all over the world!
[02:36:27.555 --> 02:36:30.536]  In Sudan!
[02:36:30.536 --> 02:36:32.237]  In Rwanda!
[02:36:32.237 --> 02:36:39.760]  And the list goes on and on, not just in Africa.
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:42.861]  The globalists want to make the world accept their new digital currency.
[02:36:42.861 --> 02:36:46.662]  China has its own plan, just as evil.
[02:36:46.662 --> 02:36:47.543]  And they need to
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:52.322]  Basically intimidate everybody to accept this, and that's what's happening.
[02:36:52.322 --> 02:37:10.073]  And while our borders are wide open, and while we're flooded with Islamists, we have record numbers of people coming into our country who mean our nation ill, and then we're told the main threat is white people, and conservatives, and Trump supporters.
[02:37:10.073 --> 02:37:13.075]  The FBI says they're about to blow everything up.
[02:37:13.075 --> 02:37:15.877]  That means the globals are going to blow stuff up and blame us.
[02:37:18.171 --> 02:37:20.473]  Ahead of the election in 12 months.
[02:37:20.473 --> 02:37:28.158]  You can see it clear.
[02:37:28.158 --> 02:37:33.941]  We are living the most dangerous time in human history right now.
[02:37:33.941 --> 02:37:37.984]  And there's many other nuclear scenarios.
[02:37:37.984 --> 02:37:45.109]  But Israel has said that if Hezbollah attacks from the north, they're going to attack Iran, and then we're off to the races.
[02:37:46.912 --> 02:37:55.702]  And everybody that's wanted war and nuclear war, you're going to get what you want, because the bankers are like Bernie Madoff on steroids.
[02:37:55.702 --> 02:38:00.928]  They've committed crimes, they've stolen quadrillions, and they're coming to the end of this, and they're going to go to jail!
[02:38:03.191 --> 02:38:08.194]  And they can't convince you the collapse is from global warming or from a virus, from a war.
[02:38:08.194 --> 02:38:15.299]  And so they're saying they're going to do this as the pretext of the smokescreen for their next level takeover.
[02:38:15.299 --> 02:38:27.987]  Instead of the globalist establishment being removed for the mismanagement and all the terrible things they've done, they're going to get full control out of the crisis they've created.
[02:38:27.987 --> 02:38:30.849]  Populists are being elected all over the world every week.
[02:38:32.108 --> 02:38:43.118]  From Switzerland to Sweden, from Argentina to New Zealand, from Canada to America.
[02:38:43.118 --> 02:38:49.384]  So what do you do when you're losing a chess game, or a checkers game, or a Chinese checkers game?
[02:38:49.384 --> 02:38:56.910]  You overturn the board when you're losing.
[02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:57.371]  Cue it up!
[02:38:58.715 --> 02:39:00.656]  We'll take some calls, but there's that famous scene.
[02:39:00.656 --> 02:39:01.637]  What a good movie.
[02:39:01.637 --> 02:39:03.038]  What a great Western.
[02:39:03.038 --> 02:39:05.840]  Tombstone.
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:09.862]  With all those great actors.
[02:39:09.862 --> 02:39:11.903]  What should I tell the crew the actual headline is?
[02:39:11.903 --> 02:39:13.324]  I've got to remember this to get it right.
[02:39:13.324 --> 02:39:14.725]  They pull it right up.
[02:39:14.725 --> 02:39:18.528]  Uh, poker scene.
[02:39:18.528 --> 02:39:22.430]  Tombstone poker scene.
[02:39:22.430 --> 02:39:25.072]  There's a couple poker scenes.
[02:39:25.072 --> 02:39:27.994]  There's the one where he goes in and the guy's running a scam and acts tough and
[02:39:30.285 --> 02:39:33.868]  Kurt Russell intimidates him and takes control of the bar.
[02:39:33.868 --> 02:39:36.129]  That's not the one I want.
[02:39:36.129 --> 02:39:49.679]  It's where one of the gang leaders, this is a true story by the way, this all happened, I read the books about it, is losing and when he finally loses and double downs, he pulls a gun out and he says, I'm going to kill you!
[02:39:49.679 --> 02:39:53.082]  Tombstone poker scene.
[02:39:53.082 --> 02:39:54.863]  He says, I'm going to kill you, you just cheated.
[02:39:54.863 --> 02:39:55.724]  Of course they didn't cheat.
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:06.124]  But that's how the globalists behave when they're not going to go to jail like Sam Bankman Freed or Bernie Madoff.
[02:40:06.124 --> 02:40:17.369]  They're going to start a giant war so big or release a new virus or both that you don't even remember the fact they just gave you a deadly shot to kill a bunch of you.
[02:40:17.369 --> 02:40:21.391]  We're living in such an incredible moment right now.
[02:40:21.391 --> 02:40:22.712]  Let's skip this network break.
[02:40:22.712 --> 02:40:23.932]  Let's go to Taylor, Mississippi.
[02:40:23.932 --> 02:40:24.633]  Taylor, you're on the air.
[02:40:24.633 --> 02:40:24.933]  Go ahead.
[02:40:26.294 --> 02:40:28.055]  Hey Alex, so excited to be calling.
[02:40:28.055 --> 02:40:31.176]  I'm a first-time caller, but definitely not a first-time listener.
[02:40:31.176 --> 02:40:38.520]  I've listened to you for over 15 years, matter of fact, and I want to prep for being an ICU travel nurse.
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:42.842]  And so I've been an ICU travel nurse for the past 10 years, matter of fact.
[02:40:45.544 --> 02:40:48.006]  My wallet is your war chest.
[02:40:48.006 --> 02:40:56.294]  I have spent thousands of dollars in your store over the years and I saw at the height of the medical tyranny what exactly was being done.
[02:40:56.294 --> 02:40:58.897]  I saw the remdesivir messing people's kidneys up.
[02:40:58.897 --> 02:41:05.023]  I found out how much hospitals were getting reimbursed for every intubation that was done.
[02:41:06.478 --> 02:41:12.419]  I've literally been on the front lines, and everything that you were saying during that time, I was seeing in real time in my job.
[02:41:12.419 --> 02:41:17.380]  I was fired, but Alex, I'll have you know that I was able to distribute information.
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:19.341]  I changed patients.
[02:41:19.341 --> 02:41:20.281]  I gave people books.
[02:41:20.281 --> 02:41:26.042]  I was able to change people's perspective, patients and my co-workers, nurses, doctors, etc.
[02:41:26.042 --> 02:41:34.644]  So just know that I'm not one of those people in the group of the 5,000 in the story of Christ where they were just listening.
[02:41:35.248 --> 02:41:40.432]  I was like a disciple actively participating and distributing, okay?
[02:41:40.432 --> 02:41:47.337]  So I ask this as a vested info warrior, okay?
[02:41:47.337 --> 02:42:00.226]  I'm a little bit confused about something, and perhaps you can shed some light, but it seemed on Owen's last broadcast that he was a little bit solemn and heartbroken that
[02:42:01.854 --> 02:42:13.178]  He wasn't even going to have a crew accompany him, and he wasn't getting the support that we thought he was going to get.
[02:42:13.178 --> 02:42:20.160]  It just seems to me, Alex, that Roger Stone was supported so much more than Owen.
[02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:23.461]  There was a t-shirt code, et cetera, and Owen's having to start his own thing.
[02:42:23.461 --> 02:42:24.562]  I donated to his fund.
[02:42:26.124 --> 02:42:27.505]  I'm not trying to instigate.
[02:42:27.505 --> 02:42:28.405]  No, no, that's great.
[02:42:28.405 --> 02:42:29.466]  Let me tell you.
[02:42:29.466 --> 02:42:30.087]  I appreciate you.
[02:42:30.087 --> 02:42:33.990]  I'm really glad you called.
[02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.610]  Let him go now.
[02:42:34.610 --> 02:42:36.412]  I'm going to answer his question.
[02:42:36.412 --> 02:42:43.238]  Back when Roger Stone was indicted four or five years ago, I ran this company.
[02:42:43.238 --> 02:42:45.099]  I run what I say on air.
[02:42:45.099 --> 02:42:46.080]  I still have that free speech.
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:47.661]  I'm in bankruptcy.
[02:42:47.661 --> 02:42:49.623]  They have a CRO named Patrick McGill.
[02:42:50.666 --> 02:42:52.928]  That controls the money.
[02:42:52.928 --> 02:42:55.010]  We don't have the money to go out on the road.
[02:42:55.010 --> 02:42:57.612]  We don't have the money to do anything.
[02:42:57.612 --> 02:42:58.733]  That's what I keep telling listeners.
[02:42:58.733 --> 02:43:03.197]  If we had extra money, which we don't, we would do all that.
[02:43:03.197 --> 02:43:04.418]  So, we'll prove it to you.
[02:43:04.418 --> 02:43:05.179]  We'll shut down.
[02:43:05.179 --> 02:43:05.979]  Probably soon.
[02:43:05.979 --> 02:43:07.981]  You'll get what you want.
[02:43:07.981 --> 02:43:09.703]  And then you can... I'm not mad at you.
[02:43:09.703 --> 02:43:14.106]  Then you can complain about how we didn't do something better when we could have.
[02:43:14.106 --> 02:43:15.568]  You're not listening to me.
[02:43:17.816 --> 02:43:21.278]  We're in the jaws of a bankruptcy court.
[02:43:21.278 --> 02:43:25.941]  And the bankruptcy court says, I don't get security.
[02:43:25.941 --> 02:43:31.865]  The bankruptcy court says, Owen, when he goes to jail, doesn't get his paycheck.
[02:43:31.865 --> 02:43:34.186]  It's not just he doesn't get a crew to go with him.
[02:43:34.186 --> 02:43:39.749]  When he checked into prison today, I had him on the show, he doesn't get anything.
[02:43:39.749 --> 02:43:41.290]  That's how far down we are.
[02:43:41.290 --> 02:43:43.652]  Have you not been listening to the show?
[02:43:45.942 --> 02:43:51.283]  I've sold almost everything I've got to keep this on air.
[02:43:51.283 --> 02:43:55.445]  And you call in and you say, why isn't Owen getting more support?
[02:43:55.445 --> 02:43:57.665]  There is no support.
[02:43:57.665 --> 02:44:01.706]  We're circling the toilet bowl right now, but I won't give up.
[02:44:01.706 --> 02:44:05.067]  But there'll be a day where we're no longer here.
[02:44:05.067 --> 02:44:08.828]  And then you can armchair quarterback that.
[02:44:08.828 --> 02:44:10.889]  Did you hear what I said?
[02:44:14.781 --> 02:44:21.206]  There's no money to send a crew for Owen because there's no money.
[02:44:21.206 --> 02:44:23.667]  There's no money to go to the border.
[02:44:23.667 --> 02:44:26.249]  There's no money to cover the events.
[02:44:26.249 --> 02:44:33.475]  There's no money to go to Bilderberg or Bohemian Grove or Davos and have a huge effect and change the world.
[02:44:33.475 --> 02:44:39.419]  Because we've been under globalist attack for six years, just like Trump's under attack.
[02:44:45.003 --> 02:44:49.305]  Now just because that caller frustrates me, I'm not going to give up.
[02:44:49.305 --> 02:44:54.908]  But it's so incredible that you must not be listening.
[02:44:54.908 --> 02:44:58.469]  You must not be tuning in.
[02:44:58.469 --> 02:45:00.270]  I've spent everything I've got.
[02:45:00.270 --> 02:45:03.051]  I'm upside down.
[02:45:03.051 --> 02:45:07.493]  The company barely has enough money to operate.
[02:45:07.493 --> 02:45:12.796]  And then you ask me, why aren't you sending a crew with Owen when he said I had him on?
[02:45:14.033 --> 02:45:15.354]  I get it, I'm the bad guy.
[02:45:15.354 --> 02:45:18.315]  When I shut down, you won't have me to complain about.
[02:45:18.315 --> 02:45:19.796]  I'll just disappear anymore.
[02:45:19.796 --> 02:45:25.019]  You'll be left on your own with your nuclear war and your bioweapon and your Walmart cheese.
[02:45:25.019 --> 02:45:26.059]  But I'm not mad at you.
[02:45:26.059 --> 02:45:26.920]  I get it.
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:31.402]  People look at us, they think we can just snap our fingers and do all these amazing things.
[02:45:31.402 --> 02:45:34.404]  And the answer is, we can't.
[02:45:34.404 --> 02:45:37.665]  The answer is, we can't.
[02:45:37.665 --> 02:45:39.006]  But you'll get what you want.
[02:45:39.006 --> 02:45:40.907]  We'll let Harrison go.
[02:45:40.907 --> 02:45:41.848]  We'll let Owen go.
[02:45:42.759 --> 02:45:44.720]  We'll close our doors.
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:46.900]  We'll let this crew go.
[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:51.442]  And you can complain about it then.
[02:45:51.442 --> 02:46:01.165]  So, I don't get up here and bitch at you and say, why aren't you supporting us more?
[02:46:01.165 --> 02:46:03.806]  I say, hey, we really need your support.
[02:46:03.806 --> 02:46:06.067]  We're really maxed out.
[02:46:06.067 --> 02:46:07.307]  But I don't wear a red cape.
[02:46:07.307 --> 02:46:08.748]  I can't fly around like Superman.
[02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:14.851]  So I get there's not real equity, is there?
[02:46:14.851 --> 02:46:17.772]  Owen's being treated wrong, okay?
[02:46:17.772 --> 02:46:21.513]  How about I just quit today and go off the air and resign in solidarity with Owen?
[02:46:21.513 --> 02:46:22.494]  Would that be a good thing for you?
[02:46:22.494 --> 02:46:24.315]  Would you like that?
[02:46:24.315 --> 02:46:26.335]  And just let this crew all be let go today?
[02:46:26.335 --> 02:46:28.116]  I could do it right now.
[02:46:28.116 --> 02:46:31.337]  Is that what you want?
[02:46:31.337 --> 02:46:31.938]  But I get it.
[02:46:31.938 --> 02:46:33.558]  You work a regular job.
[02:46:33.558 --> 02:46:34.319]  You're a regular guy.
[02:46:34.319 --> 02:46:35.219]  That's great.
[02:46:35.219 --> 02:46:40.101]  And you sit here and you look at the operation under new world order attack from every angle.
[02:46:41.772 --> 02:46:46.135]  And you say, man, I saw Roger Stone get big support years ago.
[02:46:46.135 --> 02:46:48.636]  Why aren't you supporting Owen?
[02:46:48.636 --> 02:46:51.298]  I'd say look in the mirror there, son.
[02:46:51.298 --> 02:46:56.621]  And ask yourself, what do you think I'm like, telling you we're hanging on by our fingernails?
[02:46:56.621 --> 02:47:03.626]  You think I'm telling you all this is going on like I'm blowing smoke up your ass?
[02:47:03.626 --> 02:47:05.147]  What world do you think I live in?
[02:47:15.390 --> 02:47:18.372]  We're basically already shut down.
[02:47:18.372 --> 02:47:22.254]  And I'm an optimist, and I believe in pushing things all the way to the end.
[02:47:22.254 --> 02:47:23.254]  Because I'm not going to give up.
[02:47:23.254 --> 02:47:25.715]  I'm going to make them shut this down.
[02:47:25.715 --> 02:47:30.278]  And they're already shutting it down.
[02:47:30.278 --> 02:47:32.239]  And they're going to cut your children's penises off.
[02:47:32.239 --> 02:47:33.780]  They're going to take your daughter's breasts.
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:35.060]  They're going to give you GMO.
[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:36.681]  They're going to fry you with 5G.
[02:47:36.681 --> 02:47:37.722]  They're going to go to World War III.
[02:47:40.222 --> 02:47:41.563]  It's not because I didn't fight.
[02:47:41.563 --> 02:47:45.106]  And it's not because I didn't allocate resources.
[02:47:45.106 --> 02:47:52.472]  It's because I didn't have the resources.
[02:47:52.472 --> 02:47:54.313]  So I'm offended by your phone call.
[02:47:54.313 --> 02:47:56.095]  I'm actually offended by you.
[02:47:56.095 --> 02:47:57.996]  I'm extremely offended by you.
[02:47:57.996 --> 02:48:02.500]  Because you don't get we're putting on a 110% fight here.
[02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:06.483]  You don't listen to what I say every hour how dire the situation is.
[02:48:07.824 --> 02:48:11.927]  They have the Justice Department in my bankruptcy trying to put me in prison for a year.
[02:48:11.927 --> 02:48:14.149]  I knew we didn't lie about anything, so they're going to set me up.
[02:48:14.149 --> 02:48:18.792]  They are trying to put me in jail.
[02:48:18.792 --> 02:48:22.795]  Not for two months, for decades.
[02:48:22.795 --> 02:48:25.897]  And you sit back and go, well, you should have done more for Owen.
[02:48:25.897 --> 02:48:28.219]  You know, why did you do what you did?
[02:48:28.219 --> 02:48:29.760]  Hey, man, we're shot, brother.
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:31.741]  We've been in this fight for 29 years.
[02:48:31.741 --> 02:48:33.082]  We're run out of energy.
[02:48:33.082 --> 02:48:34.003]  We're exhausted.
[02:48:36.277 --> 02:48:43.220]  So don't sit there and tell me what I need to do in this fight when I'm giving it everything I've got.
[02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:47.822]  You got it ass backwards.
[02:48:47.822 --> 02:49:04.108]  And all these people that are not with the New World Order but still think they're part of the establishment that won't bet on the victory and won't support this operation, it's gonna be their fault when they lose everything they've got to the New World Order because they didn't support this operation.
[02:49:04.108 --> 02:49:05.769]  It's candy-ass bullshit.
[02:49:07.236 --> 02:49:08.537]  It's a fraud.
[02:49:08.537 --> 02:49:09.237]  It's a lie.
[02:49:09.237 --> 02:49:15.880]  I don't even know how to respond to that.
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:17.901]  In fact, I'm not taking calls.
[02:49:17.901 --> 02:49:18.742]  I'm ending the show right now.
[02:49:19.813 --> 02:49:21.753]  Go to the Vivek Ramaswamy interview.
[02:49:21.753 --> 02:49:23.154]  Hey, how about I just quit?
[02:49:23.154 --> 02:49:24.434]  That'll make you all happy.
[02:49:24.434 --> 02:49:26.434]  How about I just tender my resignation right now?
[02:49:26.434 --> 02:49:28.235]  And then you can do a better job!
[02:49:28.235 --> 02:49:30.635]  Hell, how about get that guy's number.
[02:49:30.635 --> 02:49:32.496]  He can come here and he can host the show.
[02:49:32.496 --> 02:49:42.518]  You can explain to me how to fund all this, and fight all this, and do all this, and go up against the New World Order, and you can tell me how I can do a better job for you, right?
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:46.321]  Because you're an armchair quarterback.
[02:49:46.321 --> 02:49:50.683]  Like everybody else, like the churches, and the Republican Party, and all the rest of it.
[02:49:50.683 --> 02:49:53.324]  We're under attack because we're the tip of the spear.
[02:49:53.324 --> 02:49:56.286]  But you know what, I'm not going to let your call ruin this show.
[02:49:56.286 --> 02:49:57.226]  I'm going to take calls.
[02:49:57.226 --> 02:49:59.787]  But I don't want listeners to bring this up.
[02:49:59.787 --> 02:50:03.389]  I'm done talking about it.
[02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:11.373]  I am, you know, it's like we're in a war on the front lines being attacked, and they're like, you didn't drag the dead body back correctly to your position.
[02:50:13.237 --> 02:50:15.518]  Man, it must be easy to be a spectator.
[02:50:15.518 --> 02:50:17.539]  It must be easy to not be in the arena.
[02:50:17.539 --> 02:50:24.843]  It must be easy to sit back and watch how greater men have stumbled.
[02:50:24.843 --> 02:50:25.743]  And I'm not even mad at you.
[02:50:25.743 --> 02:50:33.327]  It's just so mind-blowing to hear that and to hear, why don't you do better?
[02:50:33.327 --> 02:50:35.067]  Why don't you fight harder?
[02:50:35.067 --> 02:50:36.748]  Why don't you stand up better?
[02:50:36.748 --> 02:50:40.170]  And I'm just sitting there going, why don't you fight the new world order?
[02:50:42.605 --> 02:50:46.451]  Hey, why don't you sell your house and donate us the money?
[02:50:46.451 --> 02:50:50.979]  Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, I just wanted to make you bad because you didn't do more for somebody.
[02:50:50.979 --> 02:50:52.101]  What the hell are you talking about?
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:00.605]  How about you go donate a gallon of your blood today and donate us the money from the Blood Transfusion Center.
[02:51:00.605 --> 02:51:04.148]  That's an archetypal thing with us is, because I've donated a lot of blood.
[02:51:04.148 --> 02:51:05.729]  And I've done everything I can.
[02:51:05.729 --> 02:51:17.699]  But I am so sick of people that look at those in the arena and then say, as Monday morning quarterbacks, how they could have done more, or how they could have done better, or they could have done this, or they could have done that.
[02:51:17.699 --> 02:51:20.941]  It's disgusting.
[02:51:20.941 --> 02:51:23.804]  Absolutely disgusting.
[02:51:26.917 --> 02:51:36.802]  If they are successful at shutting this place down, which they might be, I guess you'll go with the mainstream media headlines about, Jones didn't do a good job here.
[02:51:36.802 --> 02:51:38.023]  Jones did a bad job there.
[02:51:38.023 --> 02:51:39.003]  You'll probably agree with them.
[02:51:39.003 --> 02:51:41.364]  Yeah, he could have done a better job.
[02:51:41.364 --> 02:51:48.868]  Instead of realizing that we're in a fight for the existential future of humanity right now.
[02:51:48.868 --> 02:51:50.629]  In a war.
[02:51:50.629 --> 02:51:54.411]  And I have put up with outrageous crap and it's been a pleasure.
[02:51:54.411 --> 02:51:56.592]  But what I don't like is the calls like that one.
[02:52:06.772 --> 02:52:11.216]  You tell me I'm not doing enough.
[02:52:11.216 --> 02:52:11.696]  Great.
[02:52:11.696 --> 02:52:13.218]  What are you going to do?
[02:52:13.218 --> 02:52:14.619]  Show me how it's done.
[02:52:14.619 --> 02:52:16.260]  Please.
[02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:16.560]  Show me.
[02:52:17.546 --> 02:52:25.248]  If we were like a fighter race in World War II, I got like hundreds of enemy aircraft shot down on the side of the hull of my aircraft, and I don't think I'm the best thing around.
[02:52:25.248 --> 02:52:29.009]  I'm like, well, please, please, here, you fly the airplane.
[02:52:29.009 --> 02:52:36.010]  Let's take off, and let's go shoot down the enemy, and you show me how to sink their ships and their submarines and shoot down their aircraft.
[02:52:36.010 --> 02:52:37.070]  You show me.
[02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.950]  Please!
[02:52:37.950 --> 02:52:38.791]  Please!
[02:52:38.791 --> 02:52:39.611]  Please!
[02:52:39.611 --> 02:52:40.751]  And the people are doing a great job.
[02:52:40.751 --> 02:52:42.271]  I say, look at this great person.
[02:52:42.271 --> 02:52:43.392]  Look at that great person.
[02:52:43.392 --> 02:52:44.652]  Boy, aren't they an example of freedom.
[02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:51.442]  Because that caller is not just one caller.
[02:52:51.442 --> 02:52:52.903]  He's the average churchgoer.
[02:52:52.903 --> 02:52:54.304]  He's the average conservative.
[02:52:54.304 --> 02:52:59.046]  He's the average person that sits back and wishes Jim Jordan done better.
[02:52:59.046 --> 02:53:00.627]  Or Steve Kelice.
[02:53:00.627 --> 02:53:02.168]  Or Senator Paul.
[02:53:02.168 --> 02:53:07.772]  And they can sit back and go, well, he could have done this, he could have done that, when you're not in the arena.
[02:53:07.772 --> 02:53:12.795]  Yeah, you called into a talk show, that's good, I'm glad you did that.
[02:53:12.795 --> 02:53:16.717]  But you punch my button when you sit there and say,
[02:53:20.100 --> 02:53:22.202]  Why aren't you covering this?
[02:53:22.202 --> 02:53:23.183]  Why aren't you doing that?
[02:53:23.183 --> 02:53:28.829]  I expect more from you.
[02:53:28.829 --> 02:53:31.511]  Fair.
[02:53:31.511 --> 02:53:36.496]  I expect a lot more from you then.
[02:53:36.496 --> 02:53:41.762]  Because from where I'm at, talk like that looks like a big ass sack of shit.
[02:53:43.985 --> 02:53:50.269]  You have no idea what we've been through, what we've paid for, and what we've done to have this fight where we're at.
[02:53:50.269 --> 02:53:52.690]  We've had an incredible victory.
[02:53:52.690 --> 02:53:55.812]  We've had an incredible run against the enemy.
[02:53:55.812 --> 02:53:59.114]  But hey, what'd you do for me today, right?
[02:53:59.114 --> 02:54:07.399]  Like we're up here dancing for you, like we're on a marionette, like we're on the end of strings, and well, you didn't do a perfect little backflip like I'm some ballerina.
[02:54:07.399 --> 02:54:09.120]  Son, I'm not your damn ballerina.
[02:54:10.549 --> 02:54:24.974]  I'm standing up against the Satanists, against the New World Order, against the globalists, against the worst people this planet's ever seen, and you call into this show and say, you need to do more!
[02:54:24.974 --> 02:54:26.715]  You could have done better here!
[02:54:26.715 --> 02:54:29.656]  It's one thing if somebody calls in and says, I got an idea, you should do this.
[02:54:29.656 --> 02:54:31.376]  I'm like, yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:54:31.376 --> 02:54:34.437]  What's another thing to call in?
[02:54:34.437 --> 02:54:39.199]  With no understanding or no background or none of it in your mother's basement,
[02:54:40.345 --> 02:54:45.208]  And tell me what I need to do.
[02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:55.355]  You need to go to your bank account today, since you're above me and better than me, and whether it's $10,000 or a million dollars, send it all to mfulwardshore.com.
[02:54:55.355 --> 02:55:01.720]  You need to go to mfulwardshore.com where it says donate at the top and make a donation right now or I'm calling you out for doing nothing.
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:03.201]  We've proven ourselves.
[02:55:03.201 --> 02:55:04.542]  We've proven victory.
[02:55:04.542 --> 02:55:06.003]  We've proven we're in the fight.
[02:55:06.003 --> 02:55:07.504]  We've proven we're not backing down.
[02:55:09.676 --> 02:55:17.734]  And I'm not gonna sit here and have people that don't have skin in the game lecture me about what I can do better.
[02:55:21.069 --> 02:55:26.634]  You know the amount of harassment and degradation and humiliation I've gone through?
[02:55:26.634 --> 02:55:28.135]  I don't mind that from the end of me.
[02:55:28.135 --> 02:55:42.387]  But I'm not going to have you call into this show and like you're my officer and I'm at some type of parade event and you're going to review me and you're going to judge me about what I stand for and who I am.
[02:55:42.387 --> 02:55:47.511]  It's not going to happen.
[02:55:47.511 --> 02:55:49.332]  So you're the big genius.
[02:55:49.332 --> 02:55:50.013]  You figure it out.
[02:55:52.967 --> 02:56:02.014]  And it's this babyish mindset, this childlike mindset of the people that don't get how serious the hour is.
[02:56:02.014 --> 02:56:03.516]  But here's the good news.
[02:56:03.516 --> 02:56:04.797]  You're not going to have to wait long.
[02:56:04.797 --> 02:56:06.238]  They're going to cut your energy off.
[02:56:06.238 --> 02:56:07.939]  They're going to cut your food off.
[02:56:07.939 --> 02:56:10.401]  They're not going to cut your children's genitals off.
[02:56:10.401 --> 02:56:12.943]  They're going to cut everything off you got.
[02:56:12.943 --> 02:56:17.647]  And so you're going to have to face the reality that Klaus Schwab thinks you're stupid.
[02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:22.151]  And King Charles thinks you're weak?
[02:56:22.151 --> 02:56:24.612]  And Bill Gates thinks you're dead?
[02:56:24.612 --> 02:56:33.998]  And they're gonna come, and they're gonna release mosquitoes, and 5G, and poison shots, and they're gonna kill you because they think you're weak!
[02:56:33.998 --> 02:56:36.219]  And they think you're gonna TAKE IT!
[02:56:36.219 --> 02:56:48.187]  And they think you're gonna look at the people with the best track record of fighting it, like going to Muhammad Ali when he wins the heavyweight championship, and try to give him lectures on how he's gonna win his next fight!
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:56.960]  There you go.
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.961]  So get your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye.
[02:57:01.961 --> 02:57:09.403]  Because if you think calling into this show and telling us how we can do something better makes you a big man, then you know what, big man?
[02:57:09.403 --> 02:57:11.343]  You're the big man now.
[02:57:11.343 --> 02:57:13.403]  You show us how we win.
[02:57:13.403 --> 02:57:15.464]  You show us how we do it.
[02:57:15.464 --> 02:57:17.604]  You show us how it's done.
[02:57:17.604 --> 02:57:18.945]  I'm ready to watch it.
[02:57:18.945 --> 02:57:20.605]  I want to see it.
[02:57:20.605 --> 02:57:21.065]  Come on.
[02:57:22.193 --> 02:57:24.233]  I'm ready to learn right now from you.
[02:57:24.233 --> 02:57:27.614]  I want to be taught.
[02:57:27.614 --> 02:57:30.015]  I'm ready.
[02:57:30.015 --> 02:57:32.595]  I don't want to be number one.
[02:57:32.595 --> 02:57:35.436]  I want you to show me how you're great.
[02:57:35.436 --> 02:57:38.277]  I want you to show me how you're the best.
[02:57:38.277 --> 02:57:42.938]  And I want to show you that you're the answer to everything.
[02:57:42.938 --> 02:57:44.238]  So now the shoe's on your foot.
[02:57:47.588 --> 02:57:51.650]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:57:51.650 --> 02:57:55.212]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:57:55.212 --> 02:58:00.314]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:58:00.314 --> 02:58:02.755]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:58:02.755 --> 02:58:11.339]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[02:58:11.339 --> 02:58:12.660]  This is the Great Awakening.
[02:58:13.180 --> 02:58:17.565]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:58:17.565 --> 02:58:21.349]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:24.233]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[02:58:24.233 --> 02:58:28.097]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:58:28.097 --> 02:58:32.979]  I'm going to say something obvious right now, but it's usually the obvious things that we all miss, including myself.
[02:58:32.979 --> 02:58:36.500]  Everybody seems very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[02:58:56.980 --> 02:58:58.803]  Remember, he is a total and complete puppet.
[02:58:58.803 --> 02:59:01.567]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him.
[02:59:01.567 --> 02:59:05.313]  The CIA, BlackRock, the multinational corporations.
[02:59:05.313 --> 02:59:06.575]  People want to blame Obama.
[02:59:06.575 --> 02:59:09.299]  Yeah, he's a puppet, but he's still a puppet too.
[02:59:09.299 --> 02:59:12.143]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war.
[02:59:12.984 --> 02:59:18.287]  Against this country that's de-industrializing us and attacking our culture and creating race war.
[02:59:18.287 --> 02:59:28.613]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders and the human trafficking and the global government and the UN taking control of our medical system.
[02:59:28.613 --> 02:59:29.874]  That's what we need to do.
[02:59:29.874 --> 02:59:31.655]  That's what we've got to stand for.
[02:59:31.655 --> 02:59:33.956]  That's what is going to bring down the system.
[02:59:33.956 --> 02:59:35.237]  If we just think about my thing.
[02:59:35.697 --> 02:59:39.158]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:01.152 --> 03:00:10.059]  If you think the awakening we've seen so far is big, this planet and the globalists have not seen anything yet!
[03:00:10.059 --> 03:00:15.603]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[03:00:15.603 --> 03:00:18.324]  Google is evil!
[03:00:18.324 --> 03:00:28.011]  We now take the challenge, not to censor like you do, but to stand against you and to fight even harder for our birthright that you are trying to steal!
[03:00:29.673 --> 03:00:30.834]  Remember this.
[03:00:30.834 --> 03:00:37.079]  You killed your profession by becoming nothing but mercenaries for the globalists, and people know that you're fake news, many of you.
[03:00:37.079 --> 03:00:41.243]  Now, when you're trying to kill the First Amendment, you're making yourself true villains.
[03:00:41.243 --> 03:00:43.965]  You've declared war on the First Amendment!
[03:00:43.965 --> 03:00:45.847]  You've declared war on free speech!
[03:00:45.847 --> 03:00:46.327]  Since when?
[03:00:47.148 --> 03:00:56.014]  There are hundreds of doctors unable to have press conferences in America and they take it off YouTube, they take it off Google, they take it off Twitter, they take it off Facebook.
[03:00:56.014 --> 03:01:06.601]  There is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other just like communist China.
[03:01:06.601 --> 03:01:08.502]  I'm here to expose this fraud.
[03:01:08.502 --> 03:01:09.002]  I'm here.
[03:01:09.002 --> 03:01:11.384]  Just like the Congress has hearings about me, I go there.
[03:01:12.290 --> 03:01:15.211]  And I get in their face and I expose the truth, and that's what I'm gonna do.
[03:01:15.211 --> 03:01:17.913]  We had over 40 million subscribers on Apple.
[03:01:17.913 --> 03:01:20.214]  That was our biggest thing with my three podcasts.
[03:01:20.214 --> 03:01:21.354]  Those were all banned.
[03:01:21.354 --> 03:01:24.856]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:01:38.991 --> 03:01:41.952]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[03:01:41.952 --> 03:01:50.654]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[03:01:50.654 --> 03:01:53.175]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[03:01:53.175 --> 03:01:54.955]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[03:01:54.955 --> 03:01:56.876]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[03:01:57.116 --> 03:01:59.457]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[03:01:59.457 --> 03:02:00.558]  This is all confirmed.
[03:02:00.558 --> 03:02:01.659]  This is not a drill.
[03:02:01.659 --> 03:02:05.921]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[03:02:05.921 --> 03:02:07.462]  They've officially become state-run.
[03:02:07.462 --> 03:02:08.223]  Apple 100%.
[03:02:08.223 --> 03:02:13.966]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[03:02:14.426 --> 03:02:19.507]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[03:02:19.507 --> 03:02:20.388]  This is happening.
[03:02:20.388 --> 03:02:28.410]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[03:02:28.410 --> 03:02:34.752]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[03:02:34.752 --> 03:02:42.714]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[03:02:43.594 --> 03:02:47.197]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[03:02:47.197 --> 03:02:50.840]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:58.187]  And now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[03:02:58.187 --> 03:03:01.109]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[03:03:01.109 --> 03:03:06.454]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[03:03:06.454 --> 03:03:09.036]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[03:03:09.036 --> 03:03:16.964]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[03:03:28.707 --> 03:03:37.473]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[03:03:37.473 --> 03:03:42.737]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[03:03:42.737 --> 03:03:47.621]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[03:03:47.961 --> 03:03:56.164]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[03:03:56.164 --> 03:04:03.007]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[03:04:03.007 --> 03:04:08.929]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[03:04:08.929 --> 03:04:13.671]  Only your full understanding of this TV will break you free from this paradigm.
[03:04:13.671 --> 03:04:15.851]  I have given you the transmission!
[03:04:15.851 --> 03:04:16.752]  Now break free!
[03:04:20.536 --> 03:04:29.820]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:31.300]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:36.542]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:04:57.682 --> 03:05:02.206]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned.
[03:05:02.206 --> 03:05:10.575]  To celebrate this powerful product's long-awaited homecoming, we're slashing $10 off the asking price, passing the savings on to you.

[03:06:06.271 --> 03:06:08.533]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:08.533 --> 03:06:12.037]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee from ZeeMedia.com.
[03:06:12.037 --> 03:06:19.804]  It's an honour to be with you all here today, as it is every single time I come on this amazing platform.
[03:06:19.804 --> 03:06:28.352]  And I'm so glad that Alex has been discussing the various ways in which humanity has been and is still under attack right now.
[03:06:29.634 --> 03:06:34.554]  I'm so grateful that InfoWars has never been afraid to go all the way.
[03:06:35.899 --> 03:06:41.824]  I want to talk about that a little bit today, and I should have a guest coming on at 2.30.
[03:06:41.824 --> 03:06:43.665]  It looks like they're going to be able to come on.
[03:06:43.665 --> 03:06:45.626]  We're just waiting for confirmation of that.
[03:06:45.626 --> 03:06:47.127]  If not, we've got plenty to discuss.
[03:06:47.127 --> 03:06:59.537]  But I want to discuss the commentary out there at the moment, and I want to discuss the absolute PSYOP that we are witnessing before our very eyes.
[03:07:00.245 --> 03:07:10.213]  With the war in the Middle East and how people are being roped in, a little bit of a continuation of my broadcast on here last week.
[03:07:10.213 --> 03:07:12.275]  But of course, a lot has eventuated since then.
[03:07:12.275 --> 03:07:27.127]  A lot of commentators arose out of COVID because naturally almost the whole world was against what was happening or was at least in uproar in some way, shape or form because they were affected by loss of jobs, mandates.
[03:07:27.735 --> 03:07:34.039]  Not wanting to have an injection medically rape them.
[03:07:34.039 --> 03:07:48.749]  And so, you know, a lot of people started to criticize governments worldwide who were working in perfect coordination and in lockstep, forcing these bioweapon shots on humanity.
[03:07:48.749 --> 03:07:55.273]  And people started speaking out and building platforms on these various issues, like health mandates, censorship,
[03:07:56.256 --> 03:08:00.119]  Government overreach and that is all well and good and I applaud them.
[03:08:00.119 --> 03:08:05.922]  But most of those commentators and platforms would only go so far and they still do.
[03:08:05.922 --> 03:08:12.746]  Many of them only discuss the symptoms and are too afraid to dig all the way in.
[03:08:12.746 --> 03:08:15.768]  All the way into the cause.
[03:08:15.768 --> 03:08:21.512]  I've heard about 2% of these platforms discussing the root of most of
[03:08:22.153 --> 03:08:28.237]  Our issues and really digging deep into the understanding of the disease.
[03:08:28.237 --> 03:08:34.601]  That being the ones who are really in control and what their ultimate goal is, and that is the soul of mankind.
[03:08:34.601 --> 03:08:35.481]  Let's be honest here.
[03:08:35.481 --> 03:08:38.684]  And I'm talking about larger platforms.
[03:08:38.684 --> 03:08:47.149]  I'm talking about those who, who really arose out of this, this period that humanity has lived under.
[03:08:48.158 --> 03:08:55.582]  And haven't addressed that this has been a war against humanity.
[03:08:55.582 --> 03:08:57.704]  InfoWars has never been afraid to go there.
[03:08:57.704 --> 03:09:00.065]  I've never been afraid to go there and there are others.
[03:09:00.065 --> 03:09:03.747]  I'm by no stretch saying that, you know, it's just me and InfoWars.
[03:09:03.747 --> 03:09:10.671]  There are contributors to this platform, other platforms, the Stu Peters Network, many, Mike Adams, just to name a few.
[03:09:10.671 --> 03:09:12.152]  I don't want to leave out those who have.
[03:09:13.556 --> 03:09:42.029]  But what I am saying is when you look at the commentators or media outlets today, the largest ones that are conservative and have made their names by commentating on world issues have really said diddly squat, excuse my Australian expression, jack all about the fact, for the most part, that we have in fact been in a full scale war
[03:09:43.368 --> 03:09:51.113]  Humanity has been in a full-scale war with the globalists that attacked us at least since COVID.
[03:09:51.113 --> 03:09:59.519]  Long before that, really, it goes back to the dawn of man, the attack on humanity, but at least since COVID.
[03:09:59.519 --> 03:10:08.865]  I can count probably on two hands, maybe not even that, the number of large platforms that have called these shots what they are, which is a bioweapon.
[03:10:10.723 --> 03:10:18.109]  That have identified that the WHO is run by a terrorist.
[03:10:18.109 --> 03:10:31.400]  That have identified that they are trying to build a world dictatorship through the United Nations and their political declaration or a medical dictatorship through the amendments of the international health regulations.
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:38.286]  Very, very few people will discuss this.
[03:10:38.286 --> 03:10:38.546]  And so,
[03:10:40.112 --> 03:10:42.554]  Tell me, which platforms told you about the bioweapons?
[03:10:42.554 --> 03:10:45.176]  Which platforms told you about the nanotechnology?
[03:10:45.176 --> 03:10:54.661]  The fact that there is a possibility that humanity is under mind control, far beyond the kind of mind control that has existed for decades.
[03:10:54.661 --> 03:11:02.206]  The fact that the bioweapons were launched by the same globalists that are driving us into World War 3.
[03:11:02.206 --> 03:11:05.508]  I'm not going to tell you who to listen to in these times, but what I am going to say
[03:11:07.287 --> 03:11:14.351]  Is that we're in the most serious spot that we have been in to date, humanity.
[03:11:14.351 --> 03:11:24.836]  And the platforms that go all the way are the only ones who have any chance of taking down this power structure.
[03:11:24.836 --> 03:11:27.297]  InfoWars isn't interested in entertainment.
[03:11:27.297 --> 03:11:29.538]  I don't come on here for entertainment.
[03:11:29.538 --> 03:11:31.059]  Sorry, if that's what you're here for.
[03:11:31.059 --> 03:11:33.000]  I come here to tell you the truth.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:34.621]  I think Alex is very much the same.
[03:11:36.127 --> 03:11:38.027]  It's an interesting broadcast.
[03:11:38.027 --> 03:11:40.308]  It's always interesting.
[03:11:40.308 --> 03:11:48.549]  Alex always brings interesting things on board and he brings humanity along on the journey with him, but it's not for entertainment.
[03:11:48.549 --> 03:11:50.250]  And I'm sure he would agree.
[03:11:50.250 --> 03:11:51.990]  That's not the primary focus here.
[03:11:51.990 --> 03:12:01.371]  The primary focus is to inform humanity that they are under attack and if they don't do anything about it, they will be overcome.
[03:12:01.371 --> 03:12:04.012]  They will be overcome by those who
[03:12:04.614 --> 03:12:09.096]  Seek to absolutely obliterate us.
[03:12:09.096 --> 03:12:15.918]  I mean, totally take us into living hell.
[03:12:15.918 --> 03:12:21.800]  And when you have commentators telling you about this, are they actually painting you the picture?
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:27.822]  Are they actually painting you the picture of what that digital hell will look like?
[03:12:27.822 --> 03:12:28.862]  Have they told you about
[03:12:31.772 --> 03:12:38.617]  The digital gulag structure about the smart cities, what they actually are, that there are streetlights in these smart cities that can kill you.
[03:12:38.617 --> 03:12:44.162]  Have they told you about the nanotech that could be controlling the brains of humanity right now?
[03:12:44.162 --> 03:12:45.182]  Have they gone that far?
[03:12:45.182 --> 03:12:56.931]  Well, if they haven't, then I would be hard pressed to trust a lot of the commentary right now out there on World War III.
[03:12:56.931 --> 03:12:58.953]  Now, I'm not saying I always get it right.
[03:13:00.054 --> 03:13:00.794]  Not at all.
[03:13:00.794 --> 03:13:01.715]  I've made mistakes.
[03:13:01.715 --> 03:13:04.075]  I've made mistakes in the past week alone.
[03:13:04.075 --> 03:13:08.817]  Because the information is coming thick and fast and we are in the middle of a sire.
[03:13:08.817 --> 03:13:10.737]  Right in the middle of it.
[03:13:10.737 --> 03:13:16.479]  And just like with the injections, how initially my position was, I'm pro-choice.
[03:13:16.479 --> 03:13:17.840]  If you want to go get it, that's fine.
[03:13:17.840 --> 03:13:18.920]  Just don't force it on me.
[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:22.261]  And eventually that evolved into, no one should be taking this.
[03:13:22.261 --> 03:13:27.783]  They should be banned and the criminals that endorse this should be held accountable in formal trials.
[03:13:29.229 --> 03:13:31.410]  That includes all of the health officials in Australia.
[03:13:31.410 --> 03:13:35.371]  It includes our Prime Minister at the time, Scott Morrison.
[03:13:35.371 --> 03:13:37.931]  It includes Kerry Chant.
[03:13:37.931 --> 03:13:39.912]  It includes Dr. Fauci.
[03:13:39.912 --> 03:13:43.393]  It includes Rachelle Walensky.
[03:13:43.393 --> 03:13:56.237]  All of the heads that came on TV and said, safe and effective, safe and effective, are literally guilty of crimes against humanity, pushing something on the people that they knew would murder them.
[03:13:56.237 --> 03:13:57.517]  Or at least a large portion.
[03:13:59.315 --> 03:14:10.220]  This is so serious that I don't know how we could possibly focus on entertainment ever again until we take down these criminals.
[03:14:10.220 --> 03:14:24.627]  Or how we could possibly just look at symptoms, how we could be this far into the game and just look at symptoms and not dig deeper and not evolve our understanding of the attack on humanity.
[03:14:25.970 --> 03:14:36.454]  How can we still have a simplistic view of just looking at the symptoms and not the cause of what is causing all of this destruction now on the cusp of World War 3?
[03:14:36.454 --> 03:14:37.655]  Who's doing it?
[03:14:37.655 --> 03:14:39.255]  What is the point?
[03:14:39.255 --> 03:14:41.676]  I asked a question at the start of this.
[03:14:41.676 --> 03:14:45.698]  Why Israel and why now?
[03:14:45.698 --> 03:14:50.880]  The question is not really, and we're going to go into a little bit of this.
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:54.101]  I don't want to spend too much of my time on this, but we need to address it.
[03:14:54.850 --> 03:15:04.417]  The question is not, you know, who's at fault and I'm going to talk to you about proportionate response.
[03:15:04.417 --> 03:15:06.538]  The question is, why Israel?
[03:15:06.538 --> 03:15:08.700]  Why now?
[03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:12.182]  Who's fallen for the style?
[03:15:12.182 --> 03:15:14.704]  The evangelical Christian world?
[03:15:14.704 --> 03:15:16.265]  I want to talk about that after the break.
[03:15:18.522 --> 03:15:35.818]  Because right now, what they've done is divide all the people, and this is what I said last week, all the people that were working together and successfully for one common cause, which is take down our common enemy, whoever he is, and, you know, we can talk about that over time.
[03:15:35.818 --> 03:15:37.539]  No, no, no.
[03:15:37.539 --> 03:15:42.824]  Now they're divided, and they're trying to determine whose side are you on, what side are you going to pick?
[03:15:42.824 --> 03:15:44.686]  I'm on the same side I've always been on.
[03:15:45.788 --> 03:15:53.955]  The side of humanity and the side that is working to take down the power structure that aims to destroy us and is doing so before our very eyes.
[03:15:53.955 --> 03:15:57.058]  Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.
[03:15:57.058 --> 03:15:58.859]  You wanted to plug RainForce, do you like RainForce?
[03:15:58.859 --> 03:15:59.720]  Uh, yeah, yeah.
[03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:01.742]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:16:01.742 --> 03:16:04.004]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:16:04.004 --> 03:16:10.289]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex Jones?
[03:16:10.289 --> 03:16:13.352]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:16:13.672 --> 03:16:17.673]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:16:17.673 --> 03:16:21.614]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:16:21.614 --> 03:16:27.175]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[03:16:27.175 --> 03:16:34.877]  I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:16:34.877 --> 03:16:40.519]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[03:16:41.060 --> 03:16:41.722]  All right, we love you.
[03:16:41.722 --> 03:16:42.323]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:42.323 --> 03:16:47.399]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:16:47.399 --> 03:16:48.462]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:16:59.246 --> 03:17:01.489]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:17:01.489 --> 03:17:02.931]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:17:02.931 --> 03:17:05.294]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:17:05.294 --> 03:17:09.079]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:17:09.079 --> 03:17:10.060]  The Great Awakening.
[03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:13.886]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:17:14.306 --> 03:17:16.348]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:17:16.348 --> 03:17:25.277]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[03:17:25.277 --> 03:17:26.839]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[03:17:26.839 --> 03:17:29.241]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[03:17:29.241 --> 03:17:34.326]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:17:34.326 --> 03:17:35.668]  This is a historic book.
[03:17:35.668 --> 03:17:37.330]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:17:37.930 --> 03:17:39.050]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:39.991]  I thought it was next week.
[03:17:39.991 --> 03:17:41.811]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[03:18:03.581 --> 03:18:05.802]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:18:05.802 --> 03:18:09.644]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[03:18:09.644 --> 03:18:11.545]  Overhead shot please.
[03:18:11.545 --> 03:18:15.707]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:18:15.707 --> 03:18:18.669]  Right to the top folks.
[03:18:18.669 --> 03:18:21.290]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[03:18:24.511 --> 03:18:28.715]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10%.
[03:18:28.715 --> 03:18:31.397]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:18:31.397 --> 03:18:35.320]  This is 95%.
[03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:36.281]  Super constant.
[03:18:36.281 --> 03:18:40.164]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:18:40.164 --> 03:18:41.646]  It's that powerful.
[03:18:41.646 --> 03:18:42.787]  Or more!
[03:18:42.787 --> 03:18:44.928]  So they're available at infoworksstore.com.
[03:18:46.331 --> 03:18:49.494]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[03:19:01.499 --> 03:19:06.684]  Where were you when the Globals were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[03:19:06.684 --> 03:19:10.148]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[03:19:10.148 --> 03:19:11.209]  Well, I know where you are.
[03:19:11.209 --> 03:19:15.693]  You're watching and listening to InfoWars.com right now and I salute you and thank you.
[03:19:15.693 --> 03:19:22.320]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[03:19:22.320 --> 03:19:25.123]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening
[03:19:25.743 --> 03:19:29.286]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[03:19:29.286 --> 03:19:32.930]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and The War for the World.
[03:19:32.930 --> 03:19:36.573]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book.
[03:19:36.573 --> 03:19:40.958]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[03:19:40.958 --> 03:19:44.941]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists and it funds the InfoWar.
[03:19:44.941 --> 03:19:48.485]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now.
[03:19:48.905 --> 03:19:50.085]  We're good to go.
[03:20:16.038 --> 03:20:17.319]  Welcome back.
[03:20:17.319 --> 03:20:26.948]  Now the right, these pro-Israel Christians who have in their minds convinced themselves that Israel can do no wrong and must be protected at all costs.
[03:20:27.851 --> 03:20:36.459]  Which is predominantly an evangelical belief, by the way, and it's not technically biblical at all, but we'll address that in another broadcast.
[03:20:36.459 --> 03:20:46.807]  These people are now resorting to classic leftist tactics, such as name-calling and calling for shutting down of free speech, actually, which five minutes ago, that was staunchly opposing.
[03:20:46.807 --> 03:20:53.333]  We have people that built their platforms on combating censorship and government overreach,
[03:20:53.743 --> 03:21:10.502]  Now calling for the censorship of anyone who dares to criticize the current narrative or criticize the Israeli government, which, you know, I've made clear time and time again that I'm going to do, because what you're actually doing when you're criticizing governments is you are standing with the people of that nation.
[03:21:10.962 --> 03:21:24.272]  When I criticize the Australian government, it's because I love the Australian people and I want them to be free and free from the oppressive, tyrannical government that just keeps barreling forward with Agenda 2030, the New World Order.
[03:21:24.272 --> 03:21:26.234]  Same thing with the Israeli government.
[03:21:26.234 --> 03:21:29.857]  I want people to be free from their tyrannical government.
[03:21:29.857 --> 03:21:32.238]  And team, if you can roll the clip, I've sent two clips.
[03:21:32.238 --> 03:21:36.522]  I've got one, which is an interview with Shimon, which I don't know that we'll get to.
[03:21:36.522 --> 03:21:39.344]  The other one, if you can roll it on silent as B-roll,
[03:21:39.884 --> 03:21:44.166]  Of Israeli police beating Jews in the street.
[03:21:44.166 --> 03:21:53.751]  They were actually protesting reportedly outside a military recruitment building and then the police just beat them on the street.
[03:21:53.751 --> 03:22:05.497]  The reason I'm showing you this is number one, not all Jews hate, sorry, not all Jews hate Palestinians first and foremost, you know, even though some people would have you believe that.
[03:22:06.944 --> 03:22:11.508]  And not all Jews agree with their government.
[03:22:11.508 --> 03:22:17.733]  And there are many Jews who are subject to tyranny in Israel.
[03:22:17.733 --> 03:22:21.516]  So when you say, I support Israel, what are you actually saying?
[03:22:21.516 --> 03:22:25.960]  Are you saying, I stand with these people who... You can stop rolling the clip now, guys.
[03:22:25.960 --> 03:22:32.425]  Are you saying, I support the police who are beating their people in the street when they don't agree with the government?
[03:22:33.712 --> 03:22:50.399]  Are you saying I support Benjamin Netanyahu who brags about putting the population into a trial with Pfizer, turning his people into what he calls a lab for Pfizer, so bragging about Israelis becoming lab rats?
[03:22:50.399 --> 03:22:51.639]  What exactly are you saying?
[03:22:51.639 --> 03:22:54.160]  Are you standing with the government of Israel?
[03:22:54.160 --> 03:23:01.543]  Or are you standing with the innocent people that are currently being still subjected to tyranny?
[03:23:02.739 --> 03:23:04.500]  I reported on this last week.
[03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:14.568]  Now, if you're in Israel and you say something that, quote, harms national morale, you could go to jail and have your property seized.
[03:23:14.568 --> 03:23:16.269]  Is that not tyranny?
[03:23:16.269 --> 03:23:18.231]  Or tyranny exists everywhere.
[03:23:18.231 --> 03:23:22.954]  The deep state exists everywhere except Israel.
[03:23:22.954 --> 03:23:25.336]  Come on, people!
[03:23:25.336 --> 03:23:27.638]  We've got to be smarter than that.
[03:23:27.638 --> 03:23:30.120]  Team, if you can bring up the iNews
[03:23:31.028 --> 03:23:33.610]  And while the team bring that article up, I'm going to read some of it to you.
[03:23:33.610 --> 03:23:34.171]  So apparently Israel
[03:23:55.922 --> 03:24:09.988]  Have released that body cam footage in order to combat conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial-like phenomenon.
[03:24:09.988 --> 03:24:11.829]  Let me tell you what this does.
[03:24:11.829 --> 03:24:24.094]  And this is what the commentators, who again built their platforms on fighting censorship and fighting government tyranny, are now calling for censorship of individuals claiming that they're anti-Semites.
[03:24:24.094 --> 03:24:24.954]  I'm going to address it again.
[03:24:26.854 --> 03:24:29.956]  Here it is, here's the link.
[03:24:29.956 --> 03:24:31.977]  Right?
[03:24:31.977 --> 03:24:42.342]  So they are now saying that if you are questioning anything, it actually equates to denying the atrocities occurred.
[03:24:42.342 --> 03:24:45.623]  No one is denying that the atrocities occurred.
[03:24:45.623 --> 03:24:48.685]  I just interviewed Shimon Yanowitz.
[03:24:49.306 --> 03:24:52.808]  Again, from Israel, that interview's up on zmedia.com.
[03:24:52.808 --> 03:24:59.751]  I encourage everyone to go and watch it because last time we had him on InfoWars, we only got a short time with him.
[03:24:59.751 --> 03:25:04.033]  The reality is that many Israelis are asking questions.
[03:25:04.033 --> 03:25:07.255]  And their government's saying, don't you dare.
[03:25:07.255 --> 03:25:09.676]  Don't you dare.
[03:25:09.676 --> 03:25:13.998]  Or else we'll put you in prison and we'll take your house.
[03:25:13.998 --> 03:25:15.919]  That is tyranny.
[03:25:15.919 --> 03:25:18.620]  And that is indicative of the fact that they have something to hide.
[03:25:20.396 --> 03:25:22.497]  That's what they did to us during COVID.
[03:25:22.497 --> 03:25:23.738]  Don't ask questions.
[03:25:23.738 --> 03:25:25.238]  Don't criticize the shots.
[03:25:25.238 --> 03:25:27.720]  Don't do this or else.
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:29.881]  Israelis are being subjected to that right now.
[03:25:29.881 --> 03:25:34.583]  So if you want to stand with Israel, probably start there.
[03:25:34.583 --> 03:25:37.865]  Why aren't the people allowed to question their government right now?
[03:25:37.865 --> 03:25:48.210]  If you want to stand with Israel, stand against the tyrannical government and don't believe everything they tell you.
[03:25:50.558 --> 03:25:54.439]  I believe about this much coming out of the IDF right now.
[03:25:54.439 --> 03:25:56.659]  Zero.
[03:25:56.659 --> 03:25:57.640]  With good reason.
[03:25:57.640 --> 03:26:03.761]  No one is denying that the atrocities occurred.
[03:26:03.761 --> 03:26:08.502]  No one is denying or saying that Hamas is great.
[03:26:08.502 --> 03:26:10.803]  People have been killed on both sides.
[03:26:10.803 --> 03:26:12.303]  There was definitely an invasion.
[03:26:13.456 --> 03:26:15.077]  I posted about this yesterday.
[03:26:15.077 --> 03:26:34.145]  What we are doing, however, is questioning why the Israeli government, who even Israeli news outlets criticise for founding Hamas terrorists, instructed a military stand down and ignored the warnings of an incoming attack.
[03:26:34.145 --> 03:26:42.829]  There's even an article today on news.com.au, I haven't had the time to send it through to the team, which is, you know, sort of the go-to in Australia.
[03:26:44.297 --> 03:26:49.539]  It's an MSM outlet, but predominantly online.
[03:26:49.539 --> 03:26:59.843]  And they're talking about one of the hostages that was released that is saying that, you know, for the most part, her captors, Hamas, treated her very kindly and gently.
[03:26:59.843 --> 03:27:05.925]  That's not me saying Hamas are kind and gentle people, but she was criticizing the Israeli government.
[03:27:05.925 --> 03:27:07.045]  Here she is.
[03:27:07.045 --> 03:27:10.646]  She was criticizing the IDF and their failure to respond.
[03:27:10.646 --> 03:27:11.867]  Does she go to jail now?
[03:27:13.789 --> 03:27:14.930]  Does she lose her house?
[03:27:14.930 --> 03:27:21.056]  Because she is facing that for saying those things.
[03:27:21.056 --> 03:27:26.242]  Perhaps we should look at what they're trying to suppress.
[03:27:26.242 --> 03:27:31.287]  What we are doing, we're not denying atrocities, but we're questioning the Israeli government,
[03:27:32.136 --> 03:27:40.763]  That allowed their people, in fact forced their people to take a bioweapon that they knew would decimate their population and it still is decimating their population.
[03:27:40.763 --> 03:27:43.144]  As is the Australian population.
[03:27:43.144 --> 03:27:46.667]  Excess deaths worldwide are still skyrocketing.
[03:27:46.667 --> 03:27:59.277]  The UK MP Andrew Bridgen just stood in the UK Parliament to discuss excess deaths with extremely compelling evidence that this was due to the COVID injections.
[03:28:00.413 --> 03:28:03.154]  The Parliament was basically empty.
[03:28:03.154 --> 03:28:13.359]  These parasite public servants, so-called public servants that serve no one but the globalists, didn't even turn up to hear what he said.
[03:28:13.359 --> 03:28:19.122]  So there is zero interest in why your people are dying en masse.
[03:28:19.122 --> 03:28:24.464]  These are the same governments that we're dealing with when they are pushing us into war.
[03:28:24.464 --> 03:28:26.025]  They haven't changed.
[03:28:26.025 --> 03:28:27.926]  They're still genocidal maniacs.
[03:28:29.241 --> 03:28:31.362]  Nothing has changed.
[03:28:31.362 --> 03:28:37.205]  They haven't suddenly started to care about humanity overnight.
[03:28:37.205 --> 03:28:41.348]  So what we are doing is not Holocaust denying.
[03:28:41.348 --> 03:28:50.412]  We are continuing to ask questions about who is actually responsible for the continued loss of innocent lives on Israelis and Palestinians alike.
[03:28:50.412 --> 03:28:51.533]  And I'm not afraid to do it.
[03:28:51.533 --> 03:28:52.734]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:52.734 --> 03:28:54.915]  We'll be back on the other side of the break with Todd Callender.
[03:28:57.236 --> 03:29:03.159]  I'm going to say something obvious right now, but it's usually the obvious things that we all miss, including myself.
[03:29:03.159 --> 03:29:06.341]  Everybody's being very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[03:29:06.341 --> 03:29:08.322]  But remember, he is a total and complete puppet.
[03:29:08.322 --> 03:29:14.905]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him, the CIA, BlackRock, the multinational corporations.
[03:29:14.905 --> 03:29:16.086]  People want to blame Obama.
[03:29:16.086 --> 03:29:18.807]  Yeah, he's a puppet, but he's still a puppet too.
[03:29:18.807 --> 03:29:21.629]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war.
[03:29:22.509 --> 03:29:27.811]  Against this country that's de-industrializing us, attacking our culture and creating race war.
[03:29:27.811 --> 03:29:38.115]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders and the human trafficking and the global government and the UN taking control of our medical system.
[03:29:38.115 --> 03:29:39.375]  That's what we need to do.
[03:29:39.375 --> 03:29:41.176]  That's what we've got to stand for.
[03:29:41.176 --> 03:29:41.576]  That's what
[03:29:42.276 --> 03:29:43.457]  He's going to bring down the system.
[03:29:43.457 --> 03:29:45.197]  Are we just thinking about Biden?
[03:29:45.197 --> 03:29:46.378]  Just about how horrible he is.
[03:29:46.378 --> 03:29:47.258]  An isopedophile.
[03:29:47.258 --> 03:29:49.079]  And now his son's a crackhead.
[03:29:49.079 --> 03:29:50.560]  And gun charges.
[03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:53.001]  It becomes a distraction from the larger issues.
[03:29:53.001 --> 03:29:56.423]  We'll cover it all live at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:29:57.145 --> 03:30:01.188]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:30:01.188 --> 03:30:04.750]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:30:04.750 --> 03:30:09.854]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[03:30:09.854 --> 03:30:12.296]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:30:12.296 --> 03:30:20.902]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[03:30:20.902 --> 03:30:22.223]  This is the Great Awakening.
[03:30:22.743 --> 03:30:27.107]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:30:27.107 --> 03:30:30.911]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:30:30.911 --> 03:30:33.774]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[03:31:59.229 --> 03:32:01.472]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:32:01.472 --> 03:32:02.914]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:32:02.914 --> 03:32:05.277]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:32:05.277 --> 03:32:09.062]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:32:09.062 --> 03:32:10.043]  The Great Awakening.
[03:32:10.043 --> 03:32:13.869]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:32:14.289 --> 03:32:16.331]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:32:16.331 --> 03:32:25.260]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[03:32:25.260 --> 03:32:26.822]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.

[03:32:58.267 --> 03:33:04.171]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.833 --> 03:33:22.099]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, where only the brave venture all the way into the war against humanity.
[03:33:22.099 --> 03:33:32.266]  I know that every single listener of this show is not afraid to face the hardest truths that are out there, and for that I am grateful for every single one of you.
[03:33:33.049 --> 03:33:35.131]  We've got Todd Callender joining us now.
[03:33:35.131 --> 03:33:40.476]  Todd's an attorney who's been battling and advocating for mankind for some time.
[03:33:40.476 --> 03:33:48.323]  He's also the attorney that was in a courtroom where he asked about the term homoborgenesis and they could not deny it.
[03:33:48.323 --> 03:33:49.404]  They did not deny it.
[03:33:49.804 --> 03:33:59.810]  And then USA Today and Forbes wrote an article trying to discredit that term, USA Today, in fact, claiming that they reached out to me direct when they never did.
[03:33:59.810 --> 03:34:02.491]  So, Todd Callender, so wonderful to have you here today with me.
[03:34:02.491 --> 03:34:02.911]  Thank you.
[03:34:02.911 --> 03:34:05.233]  Yeah, happy to be here.
[03:34:05.233 --> 03:34:10.115]  By the way, they never reached out to me either, but there was a reporter in the courtroom when I said that.
[03:34:10.115 --> 03:34:11.156]  They had the opportunity.
[03:34:11.156 --> 03:34:13.097]  I was sitting right there and nobody asked me a question.
[03:34:14.887 --> 03:34:18.868]  Well, we're so glad that you've been able to come on today, Todd.
[03:34:18.868 --> 03:34:38.334]  Before we get into some of what we want to discuss today, which involves going all the way and some of what we still need to be talking about while everyone is distracted, I want to get your thoughts on the current PSYOP and the way that people are being sucked into this mess of information.
[03:34:38.334 --> 03:34:40.535]  Yeah, well, massive is right.
[03:34:40.535 --> 03:34:42.335]  And so there's a lot of different ones happening.
[03:34:42.335 --> 03:34:43.256]  But what I would say
[03:34:44.409 --> 03:34:47.270]  That there is a pretext for another global conflict.
[03:34:47.270 --> 03:34:50.752]  They're looking to spark a nuclear exchange.
[03:34:50.752 --> 03:34:56.434]  At the end of the day, in 1994, the nations of this world agreed that 7 billion people have to die.
[03:34:56.434 --> 03:34:59.916]  They don't care how it happens, they just care that it does happen.
[03:34:59.916 --> 03:35:10.660]  And I think when you have the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, pulled to stand down for seven hours to allow an attack to happen, that is purposeful and it is for the pretext of a war.
[03:35:10.660 --> 03:35:12.681]  I think they're hopeful that Iran will
[03:35:12.981 --> 03:35:19.867]  We'll kick off with a nuke and that will create enough of a reason for everybody to get you know radiated to the eye of it.
[03:35:19.867 --> 03:35:24.231]  Yeah and of course hopeful that Iran will kick it off with a nuke.
[03:35:24.231 --> 03:35:32.979]  Iran that was just given or released had six million dollars or six billion forgive me I can't remember whether it's million or billion anyway.
[03:35:32.979 --> 03:35:34.741]  Yes colossal figure released
[03:35:35.462 --> 03:35:40.986]  Which then Hamas thanked them for helping with some funds.
[03:35:40.986 --> 03:35:45.430]  So I mean, you know, everyone's in bed with each other and we seem to have forgotten that.
[03:35:45.430 --> 03:35:47.913]  We knew it five minutes ago, but we seem to have forgotten it.
[03:35:47.913 --> 03:35:50.215]  So I'm so glad that you're thinking clearly, Todd.
[03:35:50.215 --> 03:35:58.282]  Now, you sent me something which is actually a peer-reviewed or a published paper
[03:35:58.960 --> 03:35:59.881]  Which was approved.
[03:35:59.881 --> 03:36:01.742]  That's right.
[03:36:01.742 --> 03:36:06.645]  First entered in January, reviewed in February, and then published in March of 2021.
[03:36:06.645 --> 03:36:09.007]  I've checked it, verified it.
[03:36:09.742 --> 03:36:14.766]  And if the team can actually bring up this PDF, I want to talk about it.
[03:36:14.766 --> 03:36:22.652]  This is the effect of coronavirus worldwide through misusing of wireless sensor networks.
[03:36:22.652 --> 03:36:25.634]  Todd, I was absolutely shocked when I saw this.
[03:36:25.634 --> 03:36:31.018]  Not so much because it shocked me because I knew the information to be true some time ago.
[03:36:31.018 --> 03:36:33.500]  You've been exposing that, so has your team.
[03:36:33.500 --> 03:36:34.801]  I was shocked that we missed it in 2021.
[03:36:37.461 --> 03:36:39.763]  Yeah, well I don't think that it was released in 2021.
[03:36:39.763 --> 03:36:49.252]  These things have a way of making themselves out into the public realm from whistleblowers, and that's precisely what happened when we sued the Department of Defense.
[03:36:49.252 --> 03:36:55.017]  It was the first one we got whistleblowers from everywhere, and again this one comes from another one of those whistleblowers.
[03:36:55.017 --> 03:36:57.940]  The truth always escapes, and this actually
[03:36:58.460 --> 03:37:19.681]  Is the punctuation mark in our case against the DoD, what you said was right, Homo Borgenesis, but the use of Cesium-137, which you and I talked about before, turns people that are the living tissue, when it's bound to the Cesium-137, it turns them into transistors, transmitters, amplifiers, cloud computing nodes, and I know you've seen the Bill Gates patent.
[03:37:20.081 --> 03:37:22.842]  It turns people into batteries and cloud computing nodes.
[03:37:22.842 --> 03:37:24.183]  This is the vindication.
[03:37:24.183 --> 03:37:28.625]  This is telling us, yes, we know how it worked and we didn't intend.
[03:37:28.625 --> 03:37:31.006]  There's bad actors using this data.
[03:37:31.006 --> 03:37:32.206]  It was for us, not them.
[03:37:32.206 --> 03:37:34.828]  And now they're admitting to it.
[03:37:34.828 --> 03:37:40.070]  Well, Tim, if you can scroll down that page a little bit in the abstract, you can actually see that they say,
[03:37:40.509 --> 03:37:44.491]  Corona is a non-communicable sensor disease.
[03:37:44.491 --> 03:37:46.711]  Just scroll down a bit on the first page.
[03:37:46.711 --> 03:37:50.653]  Spreading worldwide through misusing... Yeah, it's highlighted.
[03:37:50.653 --> 03:37:54.895]  Through misusing of processed radio frequency.
[03:37:54.895 --> 03:37:55.975]  Yeah?
[03:37:56.508 --> 03:38:07.096]  It goes on to say, the study aims to evaluate the maltreating of wireless sensor networks that affect individuals within the body boundary area.
[03:38:07.096 --> 03:38:14.242]  Wireless sensor data were collected from individuals' profile diagnosis and sensor node records at laboratory experiments.
[03:38:14.242 --> 03:38:22.408]  They're talking about the effect of these processed sensor nodes on individuals' body organs and all individuals suffer from sensor disease
[03:38:23.706 --> 03:38:28.490]  Because of high-speed electromagnetic radio tracking systems.
[03:38:28.490 --> 03:38:33.453]  Guys, this is what we've been saying the whole time.
[03:38:33.453 --> 03:38:38.297]  These symptoms, and it goes on, and we'll show it at the end, Todd.
[03:38:38.297 --> 03:38:43.941]  It goes on at the end of the document to talk about all the different diseases that are caused by these frequencies.
[03:38:45.114 --> 03:38:52.700]  And then we wonder why it is when 10,000 transmitters, 5G transmitters, were turned on Wuhan, Halloween night, 2019.
[03:38:52.700 --> 03:38:55.703]  We wonder why it was people started falling over dead.
[03:38:55.703 --> 03:38:59.886]  We wondered why 21 million Chinese ditched their 5G devices.
[03:39:00.266 --> 03:39:01.847]  And their 5G subscriptions.
[03:39:01.847 --> 03:39:09.550]  I also sent you another document where our government and governments of this world, they patented the coronavirus.
[03:39:09.550 --> 03:39:11.471]  It was used for this purpose.
[03:39:11.471 --> 03:39:14.033]  It was intentional.
[03:39:14.033 --> 03:39:14.173]  2070.
[03:39:14.173 --> 03:39:14.893]  Isolated it.
[03:39:14.893 --> 03:39:15.193]  Why?
[03:39:15.193 --> 03:39:19.095]  Because it has electromagnetic properties that allow for track and trace.
[03:39:23.382 --> 03:39:30.487]  I mean, kudos to you, Todd, for getting these documents through Discovery.
[03:39:30.487 --> 03:39:37.992]  It's absolutely fascinating to see it confirmed now for all the crazy cookers, as they would call us.
[03:39:37.992 --> 03:39:46.317]  I'd like to see what some of these outlets that have written hit pieces on both you and I would say today, reading this.
[03:39:46.317 --> 03:39:46.938]  How can you
[03:39:47.418 --> 03:39:49.319]  How can you deny this?
[03:39:49.319 --> 03:39:52.179]  You know, the team have got one of the diagrams up on page two.
[03:39:52.179 --> 03:39:58.041]  It actually says, nowadays medical sensor technology is essential in every step of healthcare.
[03:39:58.041 --> 03:40:13.206]  Wireless sensor network is an integrated infrastructure comprising sensing, computing, detecting, tracking, observing and reacting to the individuals within geographic positioning systems locations.
[03:40:13.206 --> 03:40:13.586]  That's right.
[03:40:14.344 --> 03:40:17.006]  And by the way, now they're making it zoonotic.
[03:40:17.006 --> 03:40:22.669]  What that means, Maria, is that they're jumping the barrier between species, and it's intentional.
[03:40:22.669 --> 03:40:22.969]  Why?
[03:40:22.969 --> 03:40:26.791]  Because they want to track not just you and I, they want to track our beef cattle.
[03:40:26.791 --> 03:40:33.975]  They want to track anything and everything they can, and by the way, remotely control it, because this also does allow that.
[03:40:33.975 --> 03:40:38.298]  And so what you will see now is a big rollout across the world, something called One Health.
[03:40:38.798 --> 03:40:51.264]  And what that means is that the regulators of this planet, those in public health that use it to institute medical martial law, are going to now extend that medical martial law to every plant and animal on the planet as well.
[03:40:51.264 --> 03:40:51.624]  Why?
[03:40:51.624 --> 03:40:54.665]  Because there's a war on viruses, just like terrorists.
[03:40:54.665 --> 03:40:57.967]  You can't identify what they look like, smell like, or see.
[03:40:57.967 --> 03:41:01.749]  Viruses may or may not even exist, but we're going to have a war on them through One Health.
[03:41:01.749 --> 03:41:02.309]  That's coming.
[03:41:04.161 --> 03:41:06.425]  Yeah, that goal hasn't gone away, Todd.
[03:41:06.425 --> 03:41:08.028]  I just did a broadcast last week.
[03:41:12.415 --> 03:41:18.158]  On another show of mine, Uncensored, on the Stu Peters Network with James Rogoski, who's been focusing on the WHO.
[03:41:18.158 --> 03:41:31.183]  We have until the 1st of December, that is five weeks away, to project the initial proposals by Biden to the international health regulations, which seek to make the WHO the dictators of the world.
[03:41:31.183 --> 03:41:34.444]  We have until the 1st of December, the five weeks.
[03:41:34.444 --> 03:41:36.225]  Who's talking about it still?
[03:41:36.872 --> 03:41:40.995]  They do this at the time where we're gaining the traction.
[03:41:40.995 --> 03:41:54.887]  I mean, some people are talking about it, don't get me wrong, but I could count them on one hand because we've started to gain traction and awareness and now this huge, huge crisis comes in and I'm not diminishing what's happening in the Middle East.
[03:41:54.887 --> 03:42:00.952]  I'm saying they caused it to stop us from the traction that we had.
[03:42:01.929 --> 03:42:02.750]  Yes.
[03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:04.272]  And by the way, it's not just that.
[03:42:04.272 --> 03:42:08.957]  You know, we had the EBS signal test on the 4th of October.
[03:42:08.957 --> 03:42:10.558]  People that I know tracked it.
[03:42:10.558 --> 03:42:11.800]  Scientists tracked it.
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:13.461]  It wasn't just some EBS signal.
[03:42:13.461 --> 03:42:19.067]  This had huge modulation and spikes, which we know causes an effect on lipid nanoparticles.
[03:42:19.067 --> 03:42:23.572]  I am willing to bet you that we start having a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the middle of next month.
[03:42:24.192 --> 03:42:25.633]  We're going to talk about...
[03:42:47.662 --> 03:42:57.192]  Let's talk about that more on the other side of this break, Todd, because there are many, many possibilities over the next few weeks and we can discuss what's possible.
[03:42:57.192 --> 03:43:01.256]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:43:01.256 --> 03:43:04.819]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:43:04.819 --> 03:43:09.263]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[03:43:09.884 --> 03:43:12.325]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:43:12.325 --> 03:43:20.930]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, You Will Eat the Bugs.
[03:43:20.930 --> 03:43:27.153]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:43:27.153 --> 03:43:28.934]  It's a companion to my last book.
[03:43:28.934 --> 03:43:30.956]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:43:30.956 --> 03:43:33.417]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[03:45:01.470 --> 03:45:02.890]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:45:02.890 --> 03:45:05.251]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:45:05.251 --> 03:45:09.032]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:45:09.032 --> 03:45:10.012]  The Great Awakening.
[03:45:10.012 --> 03:45:14.274]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:45:14.274 --> 03:45:16.334]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:45:16.334 --> 03:45:18.015]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[03:45:18.695 --> 03:45:19.035]  I think so.
[03:45:37.850 --> 03:45:45.594]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.

[03:46:45.029 --> 03:46:45.329]  Let's do it!
[03:47:12.802 --> 03:47:13.282]  Welcome back.
[03:47:13.282 --> 03:47:14.743]  We're here with Todd Callender.
[03:47:14.743 --> 03:47:21.044]  Now before the break, Todd was saying that he thinks that potentially there could be a hemorrhagic fever coming soon.
[03:47:21.044 --> 03:47:24.125]  I don't know when the timeline for that will be.
[03:47:24.125 --> 03:47:29.807]  Personally, I think they're going to wait a little bit to do that, Todd, because they're on the war thing now.
[03:47:29.807 --> 03:47:33.668]  And again, not diminishing the suffering of the people in that region.
[03:47:33.668 --> 03:47:35.689]  I'm just saying it's an orchestration.
[03:47:36.569 --> 03:47:39.490]  But what I do want to do is address what you said.
[03:47:39.490 --> 03:47:44.431]  You said that the October 4 EBS was not just an EBS.
[03:47:44.431 --> 03:47:53.012]  The frequencies, I've seen many people who took measure of the frequencies on that day and they were devastatingly high.
[03:47:53.012 --> 03:47:58.673]  I just want to bring up, if the team can, from that PDF, page 23, to back up what Todd is saying.
[03:47:58.673 --> 03:48:01.734]  It says, appendix C, C-A-S-I-D.
[03:48:01.734 --> 03:48:03.134]  Listen to this, listen carefully.
[03:48:03.703 --> 03:48:13.849]  Common acute sensor infections and disorders due to misusing of sensor technology within GPS locations.
[03:48:13.849 --> 03:48:14.650]  Look what it says there.
[03:48:14.650 --> 03:48:22.715]  COVID-19, laryngitis, tracheal cancer, leptospirosis, heart attack even, Ebola.
[03:48:22.715 --> 03:48:25.957]  Go down the list of all of these
[03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:30.192]  Breast cancer, dermatitis even.
[03:48:30.192 --> 03:48:36.736]  Go, team, if you can, to page 24 where it clearly says Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
[03:48:36.736 --> 03:48:40.638]  I don't know when they're going to do it, but I know they can do it.
[03:48:40.638 --> 03:48:51.865]  Page 24, and clearly they say that Marburg hemorrhagic fever can be caused by misusing sensor technology.
[03:48:51.865 --> 03:48:53.886]  And you think that they aren't misusing it?
[03:48:53.886 --> 03:48:54.126]  Todd,
[03:48:56.488 --> 03:48:59.050]  Oh, dear Lord, we have so many whistleblowers.
[03:48:59.050 --> 03:49:00.011]  Not just whistleblowers.
[03:49:00.011 --> 03:49:01.472]  We have targeted individuals.
[03:49:01.472 --> 03:49:07.718]  We've got clients in my law firm who have been tortured for decades with this very same kind of technology.
[03:49:07.718 --> 03:49:09.679]  This is not new, Maria.
[03:49:09.679 --> 03:49:13.182]  You know, we've got, for instance, you and I both know Colonel Chambers.
[03:49:13.182 --> 03:49:16.285]  He is a victim of the Havana Syndrome, the AHA attacks.
[03:49:16.645 --> 03:49:23.091]  A Green Beret medical doctor doing his best for our government, and yet this is the poor guy that gets zapped in the head.
[03:49:23.091 --> 03:49:23.832]  This is not new.
[03:49:23.832 --> 03:49:30.298]  They've been doing it a long time, and I sent to you another asset, the Future Strategic Issues Warfare by NASA Langley Research Paper.
[03:49:30.298 --> 03:49:36.624]  I would love for some people to look at page two, because it says what bots, borgs, and human in the age of 2025.
[03:49:36.624 --> 03:49:40.488]  This whole document talks about what it is they're going to do to us.
[03:49:41.088 --> 03:49:42.629]  In 2001, it's written.
[03:49:42.629 --> 03:49:47.313]  By 2025, they're going to be bots, and they're going to drop them from the air.
[03:49:47.313 --> 03:49:50.235]  They'll be drilling into our lungs and causing disease.
[03:49:50.235 --> 03:49:51.236]  All of it is right here.
[03:49:51.236 --> 03:49:52.417]  They've told us everything.
[03:49:54.252 --> 03:49:57.773]  I think we don't have time to go through all of it today, Todd.
[03:49:57.773 --> 03:50:11.217]  What I will do definitely is organise a longer sit down with you and we'll get that up on Zmedia.com, on Band.video so that people can look through all of those documents and we can really explain what the plan is here.
[03:50:11.217 --> 03:50:16.218]  The plan has always been transhumanism and complete total control of humanity.
[03:50:16.218 --> 03:50:23.020]  You also mentioned to me something interesting, Todd, which you wanted to discuss regarding the Trump
[03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:25.263]  Case, talk to us about that.
[03:50:26.920 --> 03:50:37.347]  Yeah, so you might recall we filed something called a writ quo warrant some months ago where we found that not a single member of the Biden cabinet has a valid oath of office.
[03:50:37.347 --> 03:50:49.275]  That turned into a bigger issue where Lisa McGee, our chief researcher, started doing FOIA requests of everybody, including Jack Smith, the guy that the special counsel that was appointed to prosecute Mr. Trump.
[03:50:49.275 --> 03:50:53.238]  The Department of Justice sent us a response saying, well, you're right.
[03:50:53.238 --> 03:50:54.999]  They had two defective oaths of office.
[03:50:55.639 --> 03:50:57.320]  We admit that these are defective.
[03:50:57.320 --> 03:50:59.381]  We should probably get one from him.
[03:50:59.381 --> 03:51:08.925]  The reason why it's important is 5 U.S.C., that's the United States Code, 3331 and 3332 says without this written oath of office, you have no authority.
[03:51:08.925 --> 03:51:10.646]  You're not officially serving.
[03:51:10.646 --> 03:51:13.707]  This guy is prosecuting Mr. Trump no different than the U.S.
[03:51:13.707 --> 03:51:16.148]  attorney with a defective oath that's prosecuted January 6, 2016.
[03:51:16.468 --> 03:51:19.850]  They have no authority to do it, and they're doing it anyway.
[03:51:19.850 --> 03:51:20.830]  What does that mean?
[03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:24.191]  It means the entire thing, our entire government, this is all a show.
[03:51:24.191 --> 03:51:25.312]  It's a facade.
[03:51:25.312 --> 03:51:26.392]  Nothing other than that.
[03:51:26.392 --> 03:51:29.034]  None of it's legal.
[03:51:29.034 --> 03:51:30.854]  What do people need to do about this, Todd?
[03:51:30.854 --> 03:51:32.935]  Because we have the same problem in every country.
[03:51:32.935 --> 03:51:36.337]  Our governments are not governments, they're corporations.
[03:51:36.337 --> 03:51:36.717]  That's right.
[03:51:37.256 --> 03:51:38.937]  We need to opt out.
[03:51:38.937 --> 03:51:39.598]  Ignore them.
[03:51:39.598 --> 03:51:41.719]  They have no authority over you.
[03:51:41.719 --> 03:51:46.722]  Our nation was started by a bunch of people gathering together saying these are our boundaries.
[03:51:46.722 --> 03:51:47.523]  We're going to defend this.
[03:51:47.523 --> 03:51:50.085]  We're going to jointly develop the resources.
[03:51:50.085 --> 03:51:51.205]  We have to go back to that.
[03:51:51.205 --> 03:51:53.347]  Anybody that says they're with the government
[03:51:53.847 --> 03:52:02.059]  Are pretending because all of those people were appointed without the oaths of office, which means like fruit of the poisonous tree, their oaths are also defective.
[03:52:02.059 --> 03:52:02.900]  This is a do-over.
[03:52:02.900 --> 03:52:08.668]  This is restoration of our Republic and we group together and we start right now in every country.
[03:52:10.168 --> 03:52:19.498]  Well let me ask you, Todd, I know that sheriffs have a lot more power, let's say, or a lot more say in the United States than they do in Australia.
[03:52:19.498 --> 03:52:25.584]  Our sheriffs really only come to, you know, seize your property if you're not paying your rent.
[03:52:25.584 --> 03:52:32.791]  So can the sheriffs do something about the fact that everyone is essentially illegally in government right now?
[03:52:32.791 --> 03:52:33.352]  They can.
[03:52:34.184 --> 03:52:35.244]  They absolutely can.
[03:52:35.244 --> 03:52:49.669]  So if you find a sheriff who does have an oath of office, sheriffs that will be by state constitution, state law, not by federal law, if they have a valid oath of office, the answer is yes, they can actually prosecute, they can arrest and prosecute these people for one of two things.
[03:52:49.669 --> 03:52:59.232]  Either they are impersonating a federal official because they don't have an oath, or if they make the claim I was acting under color of law, then you prosecute them for treason and sedition.
[03:52:59.232 --> 03:53:01.653]  One's a hanging offense, one's a jail defense.
[03:53:01.653 --> 03:53:02.914]  It's really up to the defendant.
[03:53:02.914 --> 03:53:03.514]  Either way,
[03:53:04.114 --> 03:53:10.158]  They are criminals conducting criminal enterprises, criminal activities for which they must be arrested.
[03:53:10.158 --> 03:53:20.243]  It is the obligation of law enforcement to enforce the law, which includes stopping these people from usurping our country, from opening the borders, from welding the gates open.
[03:53:20.243 --> 03:53:22.525]  Mayorkas does not have an oath of office.
[03:53:22.525 --> 03:53:25.627]  He didn't bother, but he's the guy saying, leave the border open.
[03:53:25.627 --> 03:53:29.029]  If you're a sheriff, you have an obligation to enforce our laws.
[03:53:29.029 --> 03:53:30.229]  That's why you were hired.
[03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:31.490]  You got a badge and gun user.
[03:53:33.191 --> 03:53:41.874]  Well, I think this is particularly important, and people might say, well, this is small in the grand scheme of things, considering we're on the verge of World War Three.
[03:53:41.874 --> 03:53:42.454]  No, no.
[03:53:42.454 --> 03:53:48.276]  We are on the verge of World War Three because our governments have been co-opted by, we're in it, sure.
[03:53:48.276 --> 03:53:56.779]  We're in World War Three because our governments have been co-opted by corporations, because our governments have corporations posing as governments.
[03:53:58.220 --> 03:54:00.663]  Maria, it's a war on humanity.
[03:54:00.663 --> 03:54:03.085]  Every government, you said government's parole, that's right.
[03:54:03.085 --> 03:54:06.068]  They all agreed in 1994, 7 billion people gotta go.
[03:54:06.068 --> 03:54:11.654]  That was the Cairo... Simply executing on the planet.
[03:54:11.654 --> 03:54:13.235]  Sorry Todd, we just lost you there.
[03:54:13.235 --> 03:54:15.378]  It's a war on humanity.
[03:54:15.378 --> 03:54:16.419]  We just lost you there.
[03:54:16.419 --> 03:54:18.181]  Talk about the Cairo 1994 event.
[03:54:21.869 --> 03:54:26.674]  1994, the country of this world gathered in Cairo, Egypt, and they decided 7 billion people have to die.
[03:54:26.674 --> 03:54:29.257]  They have to be 7 billion off this planet.
[03:54:29.257 --> 03:54:36.044]  We are in the... We keep losing you, Todd.
[03:54:36.044 --> 03:54:40.829]  I don't know if it's your internet connection.
[03:54:40.829 --> 03:54:41.950]  It looks like we've lost him.
[03:54:42.731 --> 03:54:48.796]  If we can get Todd back for the next couple of minutes before the end of this segment, that'd be great.
[03:54:48.796 --> 03:54:52.479]  If not, I really do want to offer some commentary and a close on what he's just said.
[03:54:53.975 --> 03:55:02.279]  Like I just said, we're in this mess because we have, essentially, fake governments running around, corporations telling us that they're governments.
[03:55:02.279 --> 03:55:03.599]  This problem is worldwide.
[03:55:03.599 --> 03:55:14.324]  In fact, lawyer Dr. Rainer Fulmich identified this as he was conducting his investigations through the Corona Investigative Committee.
[03:55:14.324 --> 03:55:16.865]  He said that it's the same problem in every country, Maria.
[03:55:16.865 --> 03:55:17.665]  Todd's back.
[03:55:17.665 --> 03:55:19.586]  Todd, we've got a couple of minutes left for the close.
[03:55:20.147 --> 03:55:23.614]  Yeah, what I wanted to say is that in 1994 the world's governments got together in Cairo,
[03:55:30.444 --> 03:55:31.805]  Depopulation.
[03:55:31.805 --> 03:55:34.408]  3 to 7 billion people have to leave this planet.
[03:55:34.408 --> 03:55:39.953]  My point to you is that we are in the middle of World War III and the war in this case is on humanity.
[03:55:39.953 --> 03:55:41.655]  It's not country versus country.
[03:55:41.655 --> 03:55:53.967]  If you look at what happened in Wuhan, the coordination of the release of this toxin and the response, it was military in nature because the war goes past boundaries, past borders, onto humanity itself.
[03:55:54.554 --> 03:56:01.339]  We must collectively put aside all of our division and realize that it is our humanity that unites us.
[03:56:01.339 --> 03:56:03.701]  It's time to take our planet back.
[03:56:03.701 --> 03:56:05.883]  This is our time.
[03:56:05.883 --> 03:56:17.172]  Well, Todd, I want to ask you, because I've been very, very astounded at the division currently within, you know, all of the people that were two seconds ago realizing that we have a common enemy.
[03:56:17.172 --> 03:56:18.533]  Do you think that it's possible?
[03:56:18.533 --> 03:56:21.215]  And I asked Mike Adams the same thing.
[03:56:21.215 --> 03:56:22.156]  You know, he had a
[03:56:24.005 --> 03:56:28.626]  He put out a post saying it seems that since the October 4th EBS people have lost their minds.
[03:56:28.626 --> 03:56:37.009]  Is it possible that there is currently some sort of transmission that is doing this to people, making them unable to think clearly?
[03:56:37.009 --> 03:56:37.789]  Absolutely.
[03:56:37.789 --> 03:56:39.249]  And this is my point.
[03:56:39.249 --> 03:56:45.091]  For property crimes, for things of this nature, I'd rather be judged by 12 jurors than carried by six pallbearers.
[03:56:45.091 --> 03:56:48.152]  There is one common denominator here, and that's the EMF.
[03:56:48.152 --> 03:56:49.752]  It's the signals that are affecting us.
[03:56:50.217 --> 03:56:51.759]  Undoubtedly that is the case.
[03:56:51.759 --> 03:57:00.648]  Why are there 12 or 14 thick cables, 2 inches thick of copper, going to a tower whereby 1,000 watts would transmit 30 miles?
[03:57:00.648 --> 03:57:05.953]  Why do we have 3 megawatts of power going to our cell phone towers?
[03:57:05.953 --> 03:57:07.375]  That's the common denominator.
[03:57:09.073 --> 03:57:09.974]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[03:57:09.974 --> 03:57:11.895]  Todd, we're out of time today.
[03:57:11.895 --> 03:57:17.260]  I'll definitely get you back on for a longer chat, and we'll get that up on both ZMeter and Band.Video.
[03:57:17.260 --> 03:57:19.021]  We're so appreciative of your time today.
[03:57:19.021 --> 03:57:20.343]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:57:20.343 --> 03:57:22.304]  And thank you to all of the listeners.
[03:57:22.304 --> 03:57:24.206]  I'm asking you, God bless you.
[03:57:24.506 --> 03:57:26.988]  I'm asking you to please support InfoWars.
[03:57:26.988 --> 03:57:35.713]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, get yourself a signed book, a signed copy of Alex's book as a fundraiser to keep this important platform going.
[03:57:35.713 --> 03:57:40.095]  Only a handful of platforms will go this far.
[03:57:40.095 --> 03:57:43.617]  As we've just demonstrated in this conversation, we need to support them.
[03:57:43.617 --> 03:57:44.518]  Thank you and God bless.
[03:57:47.045 --> 03:57:55.290]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[03:57:55.290 --> 03:57:56.751]  And these are game-changing products.
[03:57:56.751 --> 03:57:58.592]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[03:57:58.592 --> 03:58:00.794]  These products are incredible.
[03:58:00.794 --> 03:58:04.596]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[03:58:04.596 --> 03:58:15.183]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[03:58:16.468 --> 03:58:18.769]  3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:24.251]  We've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[03:58:24.251 --> 03:58:28.053]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[03:58:28.053 --> 03:58:31.534]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD.
[03:58:31.534 --> 03:58:35.696]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[03:58:35.696 --> 03:58:42.279]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:58:47.381 --> 03:58:54.165]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[03:58:54.165 --> 03:58:57.807]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[03:58:57.807 --> 03:59:07.312]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.
[03:59:07.312 --> 03:59:08.492]  It's about to sell out.
[03:59:08.492 --> 03:59:09.993]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
