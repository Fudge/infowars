[00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:06.148]  It's Monday, May 8th, 2023.
[00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:15.894]  The globalists have initiated their terrorist cells.
[00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:17.015]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.536]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.867]  First of all, the idea that Joe Biden said, come, because I heard the other day that they're coming because they know I'm a nice guy.
[00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.990]  Sure, that there is, we immediately served to the border.
[00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.892]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:35.873]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:37.054]  That's who we are.
[00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:41.418]  We're a nation that says, if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:42.980]  They're seeking asylum.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.782]  First time ever we've told people they can't come to America.
[00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:47.583]  That ends.
[00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:49.024]  The cage is closed.
[00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:57.109]  Those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.
[00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.973]  Alright, a lot of you did not tune in to the Sunday Night Show.
[00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:06.715]  I know the weekday broadcast is a lot bigger.
[00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:08.656]  That's important because we've got to get the story out.
[00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:22.034]  The Second Amendment is being framed right now for the brutal, senseless attack that killed eight innocent people in Allen, Texas, just north of Dallas yesterday.
[00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:28.855]  The people that were targeted were mainly Hispanic, a group of Hispanics standing out front at the shopping mall.
[00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:33.416]  Then, the next morning, in Brownsville, Texas, on the border,
[00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:41.937]  A Hispanic man driving a SUV plowed over more than 25 people.
[00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:42.717]  Eight of them are dead.
[00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:44.958]  Many are in critical condition.
[00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.319]  A warning, I'm about to show you rabid footage from the scene.
[00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.280]  People with their heads run over, legs cut off.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.942]  But the reason we're showing you this is to realize how serious this is.
[00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:59.863]  And there's the man being arrested.
[00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:01.244]  And now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:02.898 --> 00:02:06.839]  We discover that the media is hardly even talking about this.
[00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:14.140]  This is as big as Kenosha, or as big as the Islamic attack in New York.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:25.862]  Why are Hispanic men in Dallas and in Brownsville shooting and running over at high speed Latinos?
[00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:32.083]  The poor individuals run over outside the migrant center in Brownsville are on screen, mainly men.
[00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:40.439]  The five-year-old little girl was shot and killed in the head again in the north suburb of Dallas, Allen.
[00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.122]  This, my friends, is part of a larger operation.
[00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:53.067]  Meanwhile, every major corporate headline reporting on the Dallas attack, the North Dallas attack, the Allen attack,
[00:02:54.881 --> 00:03:00.005]  Is saying it's a white supremacist with no evidence, but that an FBI source said maybe.
[00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.688]  Meanwhile, it's a month and a half, two months after the tragic attack in Tennessee.
[00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:15.516]  They still won't release any information on it, but friends and neighbors said that the person was a big leftist and transgender and was mad at Christians and mad at the school.
[00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:18.879]  So, they are putting out a false narrative.
[00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.681]  Two Hispanic men in the same gang, they have the same gang tattoos,
[00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:33.922]  of the Puro Tango Blast Group attack Hispanics, Latinos, killing them with a gun and a truck.
[00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.324]  The truck didn't do it, the gun didn't do it, the psychos doing it did it.
[00:03:37.324 --> 00:03:40.907]  Now here's the big takeaway.
[00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:45.430]  Two Hispanic men attack groups of Hispanics with guns and a truck.
[00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.534]  The media ignores the truck, doesn't the gun narrative, and they totally ignore the
[00:03:52.904 --> 00:04:02.649]  Mexican street gang, that's a Mexican-American street gang predominately, but also has illegals in it, that is a group out of the prisons that is regularly contracted by the cartels.
[00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:07.311]  Now, I got a call Saturday morning at 1030 a.m.
[00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:11.293]  from Pete Santilli, investigative journalist, desperately asked me to call him.
[00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:14.775]  I didn't call him, I was busy, didn't even see his message.
[00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:20.078]  Then, I read the messages in the afternoon, and there had just been the attack,
[00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.175]  They didn't say it was Hispanic male yet.
[00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:26.057]  That took a day.
[00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:29.199]  And I went and read what Centilli had texted me.
[00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.740]  I have the text right here.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.743]  Not going to show the name of the federal informant that gave the info.
[00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:36.824]  Or the federal source, not an informant for the Feds.
[00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:38.405]  It's Fed.
[00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:40.166]  And it's exactly what had just happened.
[00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:43.288]  He got a call Friday night, telling him this was happening.
[00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:45.050]  Called me Saturday morning, saying it was coming.
[00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.830]  It happened.
[00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.171]  Then there's a truck attack the next day.
[00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.212]  They're both the same gang.
[00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:54.636]  And the word is the cartels have hired these people to carry out attacks against Hispanics.
[00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:56.396]  We'll tell you why when we come back.
[00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:01.418]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.418 --> 00:05:07.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.701]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:17.023]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:20.227]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:05:20.227 --> 00:05:33.144]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:05:33.784 --> 00:05:43.729]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.110]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.773]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:05:51.773 --> 00:05:54.455]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:57.796]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.097]  X3, back in stock.
[00:05:59.097 --> 00:06:00.178]  Take action now.
[00:06:00.178 --> 00:06:00.798]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:11.181]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:15.083]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:31.808]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.608]  It's Monday, May 8, 2023.
[00:06:33.608 --> 00:06:38.689]  We have incredible amounts of powerful news and information.
[00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.190]  We'll have open phones throughout the next four hours.
[00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.931]  Let's dive right into the tragic terror attacks.
[00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:55.058]  That took place in a suburb of North Dallas and on the southern border of Texas and Mexico Saturday and Sunday.
[00:06:55.058 --> 00:07:03.143]  Saturday at a shopping mall, a Hispanic male in black tactical gear pulls up, jumps out of a car,
[00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:14.506]  Walks up to the front entrance where a group of mainly Hispanic individuals, including small children, were standing and talking and shot them, including a five-year-old, in the head.
[00:07:14.506 --> 00:07:24.930]  Warning, this is graphic footage we're going to show you, but people need to realize how important the Second Amendment is and how a police officer was nearby and stopped him before he could kill more.
[00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.833]  The media is now calling, and so is Biden, for a total ban on all semi-autos.
[00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:31.614]  Then, on Sunday,
[00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:52.741]  Morning, a man in a truck in Brownsville on the Texas-Mexico border, right down close to the coast, rammed a car over more than 25 people at a migrant center on the sidewalk, one of the migrant shelters, killing at least eight people.
[00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:54.723]  Others are fighting for their lives.
[00:07:54.723 --> 00:07:58.807]  Morning, we're going to show you that graphic footage as well, because it needs to be on the record.
[00:07:58.807 --> 00:07:58.927]  Now,
[00:08:01.778 --> 00:08:14.725]  Both men have Puro Tango Blast, a large Mexican drug gang, prison gang tattoos.
[00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:19.047]  One on his hand, the Dallas shooter, and that's all we can see is the hand.
[00:08:19.047 --> 00:08:21.868]  He's wearing black tactical.
[00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:31.313]  And the other, a reported photo from in the hospital of the man that ran over the people who was unarrested, of his tattoo with the same gang affiliation.
[00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:42.674]  That fits in exactly with our intel that the Sinaloa and Gulf cartel, for the first time in more than 20 years, have joined forces
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:09:05.987]  To launch terror attacks against the migrants and others that they'll blame on domestic gangs, show that Biden will be forced to put Title 42 back in place because it's estimated that the average person coming across gets deported up to, well, on average three times, some as many as ten times, and that the payment they've got to make on average is $7,000 to get back across the border.
[00:09:05.987 --> 00:09:06.727]  It was estimated in 2001.
[00:09:08.368 --> 00:09:13.909]  That just in the Texas sector, the Washington Times or the Justice Department estimated $6 billion in profit.
[00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:17.710]  Now it's estimated to be above $10 billion profit a year.
[00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:24.312]  Remember that the drug cartels murder tens of thousands of migrants a year conservatively.
[00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:31.554]  Amnesty International estimates 80% of women and children coming across the border on the Mexican side are raped by the cartels and their minions.
[00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:35.573]  There are mass graves everywhere.
[00:09:35.573 --> 00:09:44.078]  Every few weeks you hear about another 18-wheeler found outside San Antonio or Austin or Dallas with 10 dead, 25 dead, 43 dead.
[00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:53.724]  Because if they don't pay the second half of their payment from their families, when they get here, they are left in 18-wheelers in the heat to die.
[00:09:53.724 --> 00:09:56.566]  That's the brutalness.
[00:09:56.566 --> 00:10:00.448]  At least 51 migrants dead after being found inside an abandoned truck in San Antonio.
[00:10:01.513 --> 00:10:05.076]  Now, they admit the smugglers did that because they didn't pay the rest of their payment.
[00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:06.597]  They didn't have it.
[00:10:06.597 --> 00:10:08.318]  And that's a message to everybody else.
[00:10:08.318 --> 00:10:11.661]  When you come up here and we bring you across, you better have the money or you're dead.
[00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:15.604]  That story got almost zero traction.
[00:10:15.604 --> 00:10:18.526]  All these stories of tens of thousands dead get no traction.
[00:10:18.526 --> 00:10:21.548]  But then when there's a shooting, it gets massive traction.
[00:10:21.548 --> 00:10:25.511]  And the FBI says, maybe we think there could be some affiliation to white supremacists.
[00:10:25.511 --> 00:10:26.432]  The media runs with that.
[00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:31.173]  Then they totally ignore the truck attack because that doesn't fit into the narrative.
[00:10:31.173 --> 00:10:51.660]  Two Hispanic males with the same gang tattoo that is unaffiliated to the cartels that works for them, perfect go-between, launch attacks on Hispanic Latinos, one at a migrant center, one at a mall, and we're told in ultimate gaslighting, ladies and gentlemen, that this is white supremism.
[00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:59.402]  Investigators reveal more details about the gunman who killed eight people at the Texas mall, including possible right-wing extremism.
[00:10:59.402 --> 00:11:00.463]  CNN.
[00:11:00.463 --> 00:11:02.885]  Texas mass shooter posted neo-Nazi content.
[00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:03.685]  FBI document reveals.
[00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:05.466]  We went and looked, couldn't find it.
[00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:10.230]  Texas mall shooter identified authorities probe possible extremism ties.
[00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.612]  The gas lighting has reached new heights.
[00:11:13.612 --> 00:11:19.456]  Mauricio Garcia, white supremacist, claim comes under intense scrutiny.
[00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:22.398]  We've got some better shots than this that I found that we can
[00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:31.274]  Put up on screen, it's also at m4s.com, but that's the tattoo right there of the Puro Tango Blast group.
[00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:37.737]  There's another one of their gang-affiliated tattoos of the organization as well.
[00:11:37.737 --> 00:11:41.679]  That's the man that reportedly drove the truck.
[00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:45.221]  So, let me read to you just part of the information I was sent yesterday.
[00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:51.865]  This is hours and hours and hours before the attack in North Dallas, in Allen.
[00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:55.283]  I just heard something sick from my source.
[00:11:55.283 --> 00:11:56.743]  Almost made me throw up.
[00:11:56.743 --> 00:12:03.826]  The insider at the cartel sit-down says that he thinks this operation may have come all the way from the top.
[00:12:03.826 --> 00:12:08.547]  A. Two top rival cartels never sit down to coordinate.
[00:12:08.547 --> 00:12:15.769]  B. He thinks their entire scheme is to get Biden what he needs to justify not lifting Title 42 and make him look like a hero.
[00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.650]  But the criminal regime, Obama,
[00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:20.335]  U.S.
[00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:25.078]  political regime stands to lose billions as well, as a majority of them are all on the payroll.
[00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:25.778]  Confirmed.
[00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:28.580]  Unprecedented meeting between Gulf and Sinaloa cartel.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.661]  My source gave me permission to let you know who they are.
[00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:34.923]  I'm not going to say who was a multi-decade contractor for the intel services.
[00:12:34.923 --> 00:12:37.425]  Some of the best contacts in the world.
[00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:40.306]  He says this is his best source.
[00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:41.667]  The source is known to me and known to others.
[00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:43.228]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:45.209]  So, I've sent this.
[00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:46.250]  It's on my phone.
[00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.810]  10.30 in the morning.
[00:12:48.806 --> 00:12:49.887]  I don't call Santilli back.
[00:12:49.887 --> 00:12:50.467]  I didn't see it.
[00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:51.128]  The calls are all coming.
[00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:53.270]  I'm hanging out with my wife and children.
[00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.812]  Taking a few hours off at the pool.
[00:12:55.812 --> 00:12:57.473]  Finally start reading it and I go, wait.
[00:12:57.473 --> 00:12:58.834]  I mean, look at the time on this.
[00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:02.357]  There was just an attack in North Dallas.
[00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:06.040]  But who knows it's going to be a Hispanic that did it.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.561]  If it is, that'll ratchet this up.
[00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:08.822]  Boom, it was.
[00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:09.802]  Then he has a gang tattoo.
[00:13:10.663 --> 00:13:15.605]  Then, there's another truck attack directly at a migrant center, running over a whole bunch of them, killing at least eight.
[00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:18.607]  The guy's got the same affiliated tattoo.
[00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:25.210]  Two Hispanic men, in 24 hours, attacked two different groups of Hispanics.
[00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.171]  Right after we get this cartel info,
[00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:35.730]  Right as 42 is about to be lifted and the media within hours said white supremacist but never put out the evidence.
[00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.053]  Meanwhile we have the trans attack in Tennessee a month and a half ago.
[00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:46.177]  And they still haven't released that and law enforcement groups are suing it in a manifesto because we know what it's going to say.
[00:13:46.548 --> 00:13:59.351]  She, who was a he, reportedly, had been talking to friends and neighbors and saying they were mad about the right-wingers and mad about Christians and mad about the persecution of the trans groups and you saw the left all out there celebrating it like it was a great thing.
[00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:02.411]  These people are beyond sick.
[00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:06.832]  You know, Pelosi said that MS-13 are all God's children.
[00:14:06.832 --> 00:14:11.433]  The Democrats are laundering the money all over the country from the human smuggling and the sex trafficking.
[00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:19.762]  And they don't want to totally lift the border because they've already got hundreds of thousands hell a week trying to come across.
[00:14:19.762 --> 00:14:23.503]  They want some pretext to still send some back.
[00:14:23.503 --> 00:14:26.264]  So they bring forward the end of Title 42.
[00:14:26.264 --> 00:14:27.565]  Then all this hell breaks loose.
[00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:28.645]  They go after the Second Amendment.
[00:14:29.758 --> 00:14:35.381]  And then they bring forward some new proposal for some new power to deport, but only when Democrats feel like it.
[00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:40.743]  So they can continue to make money with the cartels and then launder that cash in Western banks.
[00:14:40.743 --> 00:14:45.325]  That's the best summation and the best analysis we've got.
[00:14:45.325 --> 00:14:54.490]  We know the media is covering up these were two Hispanic men with gang tattoos that are Hispanic, Mexican drug cartel prison gang.
[00:14:55.831 --> 00:15:02.213]  And we know that this very prison gang is hired as freelancers and work for all the cartels.
[00:15:02.213 --> 00:15:05.993]  They're like low-level soldiers.
[00:15:05.993 --> 00:15:09.314]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:09.314 --> 00:15:11.135]  That's what's going on.
[00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:12.775]  That's what's happening.
[00:15:12.775 --> 00:15:17.496]  And we're being totally brainwashed, just like with all the crime statistics, saying whites commit the majority of crime.
[00:15:17.496 --> 00:15:20.857]  Even though you actually look at the FBI statistics and break it down,
[00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:29.001]  Blacks are committing 80% of the murders in this country.
[00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:36.026]  And we'll go over some of those numbers coming up later, but the people don't know that because the media lies.
[00:15:36.026 --> 00:15:38.388]  They do it by manipulating statistics.
[00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:46.574]  So, the globalists are bringing the level of deception to an entirely different level.
[00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:50.900]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this live Monday broadcast.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.984]  Open phones, tons of news and more.
[00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:54.046]  What does this signify?
[00:15:54.046 --> 00:15:55.188]  We'll break it down straight ahead.
[00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:02.676]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:04.917]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:16:04.917 --> 00:16:06.918]  It will change your life.
[00:16:06.918 --> 00:16:15.684]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:21.008]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:16:21.008 --> 00:16:22.489]  Most iodine in the environment
[00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:26.733]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:16:26.733 --> 00:16:31.177]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:16:31.177 --> 00:16:38.284]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:16:38.284 --> 00:16:44.290]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.211]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:49.452]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:16:49.452 --> 00:16:51.253]  You and your family need it.
[00:16:51.253 --> 00:16:53.013]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:53.934]  X3.

[00:16:57.215 --> 00:17:00.316]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:17:00.316 --> 00:17:06.459]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:17:07.219 --> 00:17:16.208]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:19.051]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:17:19.051 --> 00:17:22.375]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:30.343]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:17:30.863 --> 00:17:35.687]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:47.217]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:17:47.217 --> 00:17:53.282]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:12.962]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[00:18:12.962 --> 00:18:19.544]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[00:18:19.544 --> 00:18:24.104]  I want to remind you we're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:27.265]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,

[00:18:29.366 --> 00:18:35.450]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.831]  But they're selling out quick.
[00:18:36.831 --> 00:18:39.513]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[00:18:39.513 --> 00:18:42.735]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[00:18:42.735 --> 00:18:45.097]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[00:18:45.097 --> 00:18:46.177]  It's about to sell out.

[00:19:00.028 --> 00:19:04.052]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:19:04.052 --> 00:19:07.936]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:10.319]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:12.702]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:19:12.702 --> 00:19:15.264]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:19:16.025 --> 00:19:20.487]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:23.889]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:19:23.889 --> 00:19:27.930]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.531]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[00:19:30.531 --> 00:19:31.612]  It just can't end.
[00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:33.353]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:33.753]  Stop!
[00:19:33.753 --> 00:19:35.315]  Stop!
[00:19:35.315 --> 00:19:35.835]  Stop!
[00:19:35.835 --> 00:19:37.936]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:19:37.936 --> 00:19:39.578]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.760]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.261]  You silenced those voices.
[00:19:44.261 --> 00:19:48.024]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:19:48.024 --> 00:19:54.429]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:05.278]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.278 --> 00:20:15.063]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:15.063 --> 00:20:16.944]  Alright, you're not going to have to hold long.
[00:20:16.944 --> 00:20:19.565]  I've gotten a lot better about actually going to your calls, as everyone has noticed.
[00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:28.190]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, but I'm going to open the phones up right now for law enforcement and or people directly
[00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:36.565]  That witnessed the shooting in North Dallas, Saturday, or from the border with Mexico.
[00:20:36.565 --> 00:20:38.226]  What are you seeing in McAllen?
[00:20:38.226 --> 00:20:39.286]  What are you seeing in Brownsville?
[00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:41.808]  What are you seeing in El Paso?
[00:20:41.808 --> 00:20:43.829]  What are you seeing in the Big Bend area?
[00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:49.312]  What are you seeing all across that long, 300 plus mile border?
[00:20:49.312 --> 00:20:50.913]  We will go directly to you.
[00:20:50.913 --> 00:20:51.673]  You can make your point.
[00:20:51.673 --> 00:20:54.414]  We'll move on to the next person.
[00:20:54.414 --> 00:20:56.916]  I have been in contact with FBI agents, DEA agents.
[00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.992]  High-level federal officials directly in meetings.
[00:21:03.992 --> 00:21:08.294]  Two weeks ago, as you know, two Mondays ago, I told you this was all about to happen.
[00:21:08.294 --> 00:21:19.159]  The Pete Santilli information, he was on last night with us, he'll probably be popping in later today, is bone-chilling.
[00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:23.361]  He starts texting me and calling me in the morning.
[00:21:23.361 --> 00:21:25.582]  I had my phone off, was ignoring it.
[00:21:28.576 --> 00:21:33.017]  And get out later, learn there's been a shooting in North Dallas.
[00:21:33.017 --> 00:21:36.699]  Look at his message saying, do not go in the grocery stores.
[00:21:36.699 --> 00:21:38.539]  It's only part of the message.
[00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:40.380]  Do not go in the malls.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.081]  Attacks are imminent.
[00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:44.481]  Now, let me just read you the other messages.
[00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:46.602]  It's got people's names and stuff in it.
[00:21:46.602 --> 00:21:52.564]  So don't show this for the camera, guys.
[00:21:52.564 --> 00:21:53.144]  Back to it here.
[00:21:57.386 --> 00:21:58.227]  Go back to the start of it.
[00:21:58.227 --> 00:22:02.469]  A lot of hair.
[00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:09.753]  Okay, so this is us talking Friday night.
[00:22:09.753 --> 00:22:18.799]  They're gonna go for Trump now and also round up a thousand, three thousand more in charge of a suspicious conspiracy.
[00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:20.840]  Yeah, I've been talking to and interviewing Jan.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.921]  Just got off a segment with him.
[00:22:22.921 --> 00:22:23.702]  We're in big trouble.
[00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:26.502]  You're in the right place spiritually.
[00:22:26.502 --> 00:22:31.503]  I have enough faith to believe that he will intervene.
[00:22:31.503 --> 00:22:32.303]  We get right with God.
[00:22:32.303 --> 00:22:38.085]  All right.
[00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:41.365]  This then came in.
[00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:44.826]  Just got another high-level report from an insider with the cartels.
[00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:50.747]  Two cartels sat down to discuss launching a mirage of mass casualty events.
[00:22:50.747 --> 00:22:53.868]  The cartels want to stop the lifting of 42.
[00:22:53.868 --> 00:22:54.728]  They stand to lose.
[00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:56.719]  Billions.
[00:22:56.719 --> 00:22:59.460]  My source has known the insider for 28 years.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.621]  Tier one operator with the bad guys.
[00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:04.881]  100% going to happen immediately.
[00:23:04.881 --> 00:23:08.742]  Advisory is to stay out of grocery stores is what the feds were telling feds.
[00:23:08.742 --> 00:23:09.762]  Public events.
[00:23:09.762 --> 00:23:14.944]  They're going to set it up to blame the migration wave.
[00:23:14.944 --> 00:23:17.884]  Let me get on the phone we discuss why it's happening.
[00:23:17.884 --> 00:23:21.645]  As that was unfolding my guy was sending me messages.
[00:23:21.645 --> 00:23:23.426]  City of Dallas.
[00:23:23.426 --> 00:23:24.706]  I bet he's tango blast.
[00:23:25.882 --> 00:23:28.603]  I'm being told it's going to scale up big time.
[00:23:28.603 --> 00:23:30.444]  Next day there's another terror attack.
[00:23:30.444 --> 00:23:32.884]  Tango Blast is affiliated.
[00:23:32.884 --> 00:23:37.386]  And then it goes on with all the messages you heard me read over.
[00:23:37.386 --> 00:23:43.388]  So that's the stuff going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:46.649]  And it's happening.
[00:23:46.649 --> 00:23:54.532]  This is what the cartels do all day, every day, all over Central and South America, all over Southern North America and Mexico.
[00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:57.579]  They go in and blow up schools.
[00:23:57.579 --> 00:23:59.421]  They torture little kids in front of their parents.
[00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:01.423]  They pour ass on their faces.
[00:24:01.423 --> 00:24:05.286]  They torture people in satanic ceremonies.
[00:24:05.286 --> 00:24:09.129]  You cannot make up the level of barbarity.
[00:24:09.129 --> 00:24:23.781]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands dead, it's estimated, in just the last decade, in the last 12 years, from the cartels and mass graves all over northern Mexico, on the Texas
[00:24:24.912 --> 00:24:29.556]  California, Arizona borders.
[00:24:29.556 --> 00:24:31.998]  This is so serious.
[00:24:31.998 --> 00:24:36.222]  And notice all that's kept out of the papers, out of the news.
[00:24:36.222 --> 00:24:38.724]  It's barely a blip.
[00:24:38.724 --> 00:24:40.545]  That all gets suppressed.
[00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.006]  50 plus dead in one tractor trailer.
[00:24:42.006 --> 00:24:45.569]  40 something dead in another one.
[00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:46.690]  20 something dead in another.
[00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.271]  Every week.
[00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:52.312]  You don't pay the money, they just lock your ass up in the tractor-trailer on the U.S.
[00:24:52.312 --> 00:24:52.612]  side.
[00:24:52.612 --> 00:24:54.493]  You're supposed to pay.
[00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:57.595]  Part when you come across, part when you get over, you're promising you've got money.
[00:24:57.595 --> 00:25:09.263]  A Mexican cop finds 40 skulls and fetuses in a jar at a satanic altar, set up by drug traffickers who thought it would protect them from the police.
[00:25:09.263 --> 00:25:11.045]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:25:11.045 --> 00:25:12.806]  Thousands and thousands of such articles.
[00:25:14.141 --> 00:25:18.742]  We'd see reports about a bunch of severed heads dumped out in front of the Capitol in Arizona a few years ago.
[00:25:18.742 --> 00:25:19.262]  I covered it.
[00:25:19.262 --> 00:25:20.482]  The Young Turks.
[00:25:20.482 --> 00:25:21.722]  People made jokes that it didn't happen.
[00:25:21.722 --> 00:25:23.603]  It did.
[00:25:23.603 --> 00:25:27.284]  So, at first, they didn't want you to know this was going on as it grew and got out of control.
[00:25:27.284 --> 00:25:31.064]  Now, oh, there's a mass shooting in North Dallas.
[00:25:31.064 --> 00:25:36.005]  It's white supremacists, and it's the Second Amendment's fault.
[00:25:36.005 --> 00:25:39.606]  And it is a man with prison tattoos.
[00:25:43.154 --> 00:25:48.215]  Jumping out of a car and killing Hispanics.
[00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:51.476]  That's how stupid the system thinks you are.
[00:25:51.476 --> 00:25:59.038]  And now, I was trying to look, have they even identified who ran the truck over?
[00:25:59.038 --> 00:26:02.019]  A Hispanic man with, again, the same gang identities.
[00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:06.420]  Eight dead after a pedestrian struck by a car outside a Texas migrant shelter.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.260]  Driver in custody.
[00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:11.739]  And I've got stories on this.
[00:26:11.739 --> 00:26:13.321]  There's almost nothing today.
[00:26:13.321 --> 00:26:18.644]  Only a few articles yesterday.
[00:26:18.644 --> 00:26:22.467]  Guys, keep searching on Brownsville car attack.
[00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:23.168]  They're in there checking.
[00:26:23.168 --> 00:26:25.129]  There's basically nothing.
[00:26:25.129 --> 00:26:30.653]  Can you imagine if a white man ran over a bunch of Hispanics or ran over some black people?
[00:26:30.653 --> 00:26:34.336]  It'd be burning cities into the world.
[00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:35.637]  But boom!
[00:26:35.637 --> 00:26:37.839]  Eight dead run over in a gruesome fashion.
[00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:44.655]  Basically this is almost zero coverage.
[00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:46.076]  You'd think it'd be all over the news.
[00:26:46.076 --> 00:26:47.037]  Who is he?
[00:26:47.037 --> 00:26:51.721]  Why'd he do it?
[00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:56.324]  And I've looked at the photo that was released saying, this was taken in the hospital bed, it looks like the same man.
[00:26:56.324 --> 00:27:03.489]  You can see when he's down on his knees at rest, it looks like he's got that same tattoo on his belly.
[00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:08.053]  But we don't know the full details, the finer details, because
[00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:23.867]  There's a blackout on this, but there's not a blackout on the lie that a white supremacist Hispanic man with gang tattoos jumps out of a car and kills Hispanics standing out front.
[00:27:23.867 --> 00:27:29.448]  There's his name, George Alvarez.
[00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:32.489]  Yep, that's the man with the tattoos and the photo in the hospital.
[00:27:32.489 --> 00:27:34.970]  So somebody wanted us to have that photo.
[00:27:36.561 --> 00:27:41.625]  Do me a favor, put that screenshot back up there so I can read the criminal history.
[00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:43.646]  Two aggravated assaults with a deadly weapon.
[00:27:43.646 --> 00:27:46.168]  One assault against elderly or disabled.
[00:27:46.168 --> 00:27:49.110]  Four assaults causing bodily injury to a family member.
[00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.391]  One assault on public servant.
[00:27:50.391 --> 00:27:51.532]  Two burglary of a vehicle.
[00:27:51.532 --> 00:27:53.273]  One assault causing bodily injury.
[00:27:53.273 --> 00:27:54.554]  Two criminal mischief.
[00:27:54.554 --> 00:27:55.655]  One driving while intoxicated.
[00:27:55.655 --> 00:27:57.276]  One evading arrest detention.
[00:27:57.276 --> 00:27:59.098]  Interference with public duties.
[00:27:59.098 --> 00:28:01.459]  Obstruction and retaliation.
[00:28:01.459 --> 00:28:02.840]  Possession of marijuana.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.161]  Resisting arrest.
[00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:04.942]  Theft of property.
[00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:10.581]  Let's show the hospital bed photo of him, please.
[00:28:10.581 --> 00:28:17.864]  And his prison tattoos.
[00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:22.187]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:28:22.187 --> 00:28:26.889]  The Puro Tango Blast Club gang.
[00:28:26.889 --> 00:28:29.090]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:34.333]  Law enforcement are people directly on the border that are witnesses.
[00:28:35.674 --> 00:28:38.735]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:38.735 --> 00:28:40.576]  Military, want to call in as well.
[00:28:40.576 --> 00:28:43.877]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:43.877 --> 00:28:46.718]  Is it when I'm laying out the most probable thing that's going on?
[00:28:46.718 --> 00:28:48.538]  We know they're lying about the white supremacist stuff.
[00:28:48.538 --> 00:28:49.478]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:49.639]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:49.639 --> 00:28:51.139]  Now they're coming after our guns.
[00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:51.719]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:51.719 --> 00:28:51.979]  InfoWars.com.
[00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:05.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:29:05.862 --> 00:29:08.844]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:29:08.844 --> 00:29:18.389]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.330]  The number one preventable cause
[00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:31.953]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:29:31.953 --> 00:29:41.896]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:29:41.896 --> 00:29:44.257]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[00:29:44.257 --> 00:29:47.318]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together
[00:29:48.038 --> 00:29:53.664]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:29:53.664 --> 00:29:56.827]  People said, no way, he's the most popular thing that ever happened.
[00:29:56.827 --> 00:29:59.089]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.201]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:30:13.201 --> 00:30:16.422]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:30:16.422 --> 00:30:18.183]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:24.805]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:30:24.805 --> 00:30:27.586]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:30:28.584 --> 00:30:30.665]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.

[00:30:35.309 --> 00:30:39.051]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we, the people.
[00:30:39.051 --> 00:30:42.173]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage you as listeners to understand.
[00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:44.735]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:30:44.735 --> 00:30:46.076]  We're barely hanging on.

[00:30:59.425 --> 00:30:59.665]  That's
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.664]  Wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:31:23.664 --> 00:31:25.425]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:38.495]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:31:38.495 --> 00:31:40.497]  It is the super fuel.
[00:31:40.497 --> 00:31:41.958]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:42.819]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:43.779]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:44.960]  They go good with this.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.002]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:31:47.702 --> 00:31:49.183]  This is the Boss.
[00:31:49.183 --> 00:31:49.924]  TurboForce.
[00:31:49.924 --> 00:31:50.945]  Back in stock.
[00:31:50.945 --> 00:31:51.946]  Discounted.

[00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:54.548]  More power.
[00:31:54.548 --> 00:31:55.549]  More strength.
[00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:56.070]  More energy.
[00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:02.553]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[00:32:02.553 --> 00:32:07.337]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[00:32:07.337 --> 00:32:12.461]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:19.047]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[00:32:19.047 --> 00:32:23.610]  I want to remind you we're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.773]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[00:32:27.193 --> 00:32:28.834]  You want to go research.
[00:32:28.834 --> 00:32:34.938]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[00:32:34.938 --> 00:32:36.319]  But they're selling out quick.
[00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:39.001]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[00:32:39.001 --> 00:32:42.223]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[00:32:42.223 --> 00:32:44.565]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[00:32:44.565 --> 00:32:45.665]  It's about to sell out.
[00:32:45.665 --> 00:32:53.391]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:54.451]  Thank you for your support.
[00:33:01.636 --> 00:33:13.042]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.042 --> 00:33:15.204]  Jorge Alvarez.
[00:33:15.204 --> 00:33:17.045]  Plowed over more than 25 people, killing 8.
[00:33:17.045 --> 00:33:18.906]  There's almost zero coverage.
[00:33:24.417 --> 00:33:31.539]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.539 --> 00:33:41.203]  The SUV ran a red light, lost control, flipped on its side and struck a total of 18 individuals.
[00:33:41.203 --> 00:33:46.265]  It was further found that there were six fatalities on scene and 12 critically injured.
[00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:52.244]  From then and now, fatalities have grown to eight.
[00:33:52.244 --> 00:34:08.836]  Investigation also revealed that the driver of the vehicle, later identified as George Alvarez, November 9th, 1988, had attempted to flee the scene after impact, but was held down by several individuals on scene.
[00:34:08.836 --> 00:34:11.338]  Investigation also revealed that the driver of the vehicle
[00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:13.896]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:13.896 --> 00:34:17.180]  George Alvarez is a Brownsville local with an extensive rap scene.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:24.389]  He has been formally charged and arraigned with 8 counts of manslaughter, 10 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
[00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:33.460]  He has received bonds totaling $3.6 million and we have his picture and record of various previous arrests as we will display to you all right now.
[00:34:48.288 --> 00:34:52.790]  So, they're going with the story, he did it on accident.
[00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.411]  Drove up on the curb and ran over people.
[00:34:54.411 --> 00:35:01.213]  I want to thank my men and women serving, who have worked and continue to process the scene, the very tragic scene.
[00:35:01.213 --> 00:35:07.176]  I'd also like to thank and acknowledge our Brownsville Fire Department for tending to the critically injured.
[00:35:07.176 --> 00:35:11.558]  They were saying 24 run over, it's only 18, that's good, but they did.
[00:35:11.558 --> 00:35:11.798]  So,
[00:35:13.015 --> 00:35:15.417]  We're told by our sources this is all about to start happening.
[00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:25.047]  It starts happening and they're telling us white supremacists are attacking everybody and saying that white people kill the majority of people and that they're out hunting minorities and killing them.
[00:35:25.047 --> 00:35:27.870]  But I have the FBI statistics, they're not accurate.
[00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.553]  Later I'll actually go over the statistics after we take some calls.
[00:35:31.786 --> 00:35:37.155]  But Elon Musk retweeted this mathematician, and we've looked at his numbers, they're accurate.
[00:35:37.155 --> 00:35:42.585]  I've got a whole stack of actual graphs here on what's really going on with the crime statistics and how they're manipulating them.
[00:35:42.585 --> 00:35:42.845]  Here it is.
[00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:48.878]  At this point, you've probably heard the 1350 statistic and how it might be wrong.
[00:35:48.878 --> 00:35:50.620]  God made me Asian for a reason.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:57.164]  So the biggest problem with the FBI's 50% number is that those are arrest totals and that the true number could be different for a lot of different reasons.
[00:35:57.164 --> 00:36:02.488]  So I decided to calculate the true number using the National Crime Victimization Survey and what we know about interracial crime.
[00:36:02.488 --> 00:36:04.930]  Because if you can't arrest a perpetrator, you can always take a look at the victim.
[00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:11.174]  You don't have to know what any of this shit means, but according to the NCVS, 52% of all homicide victims are black and 42% of all homicide victims are white.
[00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:23.022]  Using FBI crosstabs, we can figure out that 88% of white murder victims were murdered by other white people, and 81% of black murder victims were murdered by other black people.
[00:36:23.022 --> 00:36:31.308]  From there, we get this equation where the total number of white murder victims is the amount of white people murdered by white people, and the amount of white people murdered by black people, and the other way around.
[00:36:31.308 --> 00:36:36.631]  With some algebra, we convert this into an equation that calculates the proportion of white and black perpetrators.
[00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:41.634]  So with this method, we can calculate that the true number isn't 50%, but 60% of all murders were committed by black people.
[00:36:44.296 --> 00:36:50.379]  So it turns out that the FBI was wrong, just not in the direction that most people thought it would be.
[00:36:50.379 --> 00:36:54.602]  And 80 plus percent of blacks are killed by blacks.
[00:36:54.602 --> 00:36:57.763]  Now, that was the number I was mentioning earlier.
[00:36:57.763 --> 00:37:02.566]  Blacks are 13% of the population.
[00:37:02.566 --> 00:37:05.547]  Less than half of that 13% is male.
[00:37:05.547 --> 00:37:06.968]  And it's less than 1% of that number
[00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:12.010]  That actually commit the murders.
[00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:24.216]  So it is a tiny minority of black males that are committing 60% of the murder in the United States.
[00:37:24.216 --> 00:37:26.057]  Think about that.
[00:37:26.057 --> 00:37:30.379]  It is a tiny fraction of black people that are out committing all these crimes.
[00:37:30.379 --> 00:37:36.743]  But the group that's doing it commits a massive, massive
[00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:38.945]  Massive number.
[00:37:38.945 --> 00:37:42.706]  And the police most of the time don't even show up.
[00:37:42.706 --> 00:37:44.928]  And then remember what happened last year?
[00:37:44.928 --> 00:37:47.909]  They reported crime down 0.2% in major cities.
[00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:49.410]  You know why?
[00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:58.514]  The FBI did not count crime in over 800 cities and towns to cover up the massive crime wave.
[00:37:58.514 --> 00:38:05.578]  And whereas blacks have normally historically killed blacks, just like most white people are killed in the past by other whites, people they know,
[00:38:06.707 --> 00:38:13.989]  Now, that number has totally shifted and the majority of whites are being killed by blacks.
[00:38:13.989 --> 00:38:21.510]  And that's because the left has said, whites are evil, whites are racist, they're out to get you, they deserve to die.
[00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:32.953]  We can show you the footage we put up yesterday of a white homeless man sitting on the street, and a black man walks over, takes about a minute to make sure the gun's loaded, and shoots him execution style in the back of the head.
[00:38:34.076 --> 00:38:37.519]  Who's pushing people into the subway tracks?
[00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:39.421]  Who's shooting white people in the back of the head?
[00:38:39.421 --> 00:38:40.982]  Who's shooting police officers?
[00:38:40.982 --> 00:38:43.584]  Who's shooting black people?
[00:38:43.584 --> 00:38:52.172]  A tiny percentage of the black population.
[00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:55.115]  But it's like a serial killer.
[00:38:55.115 --> 00:38:59.819]  And it's true in the crime statistics that the majority of serial killers in the West are white.
[00:39:00.882 --> 00:39:04.804]  That is the weird crime anomaly.
[00:39:04.804 --> 00:39:08.165]  But still, serial killers account for a tiny portion of death.
[00:39:08.165 --> 00:39:16.848]  But it is normally highly intelligent white males that are the premeditated serial killer type.
[00:39:16.848 --> 00:39:18.729]  It's just a fact.
[00:39:18.729 --> 00:39:29.313]  And when you talk about robberies, and rapes, and murder, for almost no reason in every case, just randomly,
[00:39:31.365 --> 00:39:35.566]  It's a small percentage of young black males.
[00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:40.808]  But that small percentage, compared to the other small percentages, is mountainous.
[00:39:40.808 --> 00:39:51.692]  So again, they lie in the media about the statistics and tell you that there is a crime wave of white people.
[00:39:51.692 --> 00:39:52.872]  And they're not.
[00:39:52.872 --> 00:39:57.194]  But there's a new anomaly in the crime statistics, and I've got a bunch of them right here.
[00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.315]  We'll go to your phone calls.
[00:39:59.315 --> 00:40:00.075]  We'll get more into this later.
[00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:11.272]  And that is the Soros DAs, and again, over 800 cities and towns, who are charging people, predominantly whites, if they defend themselves with a firearm.
[00:40:11.272 --> 00:40:16.793]  Those are now being counted as murders.
[00:40:16.793 --> 00:40:21.114]  So Elon Musk tweeted this.
[00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:21.795]  It's a graph.
[00:40:21.795 --> 00:40:23.235]  It's very accurate.
[00:40:23.235 --> 00:40:28.296]  And they illustrate here with a television camera zoomed in only on the white on black crime.
[00:40:30.592 --> 00:40:33.714]  Which is the next to smallest graph.
[00:40:33.714 --> 00:40:39.039]  Hispanic on black is the smallest.
[00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:41.961]  59,778 white crimes against blacks.
[00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:44.303]  Everything in there, murder, you name it.
[00:40:44.303 --> 00:40:45.344]  Hispanic on black, 44,551.
[00:40:45.344 --> 00:40:47.545]  Hispanic on white, 365,299.
[00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:50.848]  So the Hispanics are really starting to attack the whites as well.
[00:40:56.647 --> 00:41:05.132]  A lot of Hispanics, whites are killing a lot more and hurting a lot more Hispanics than whites are killing blacks.
[00:41:05.132 --> 00:41:07.993]  But almost double the amount of crime by Hispanics against whites.
[00:41:07.993 --> 00:41:12.015]  And then look up here, this tower of black on white crime. 547,948.
[00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:22.729]  The survey statistics are usually a few years behind.
[00:41:22.729 --> 00:41:24.449]  Plus the FBI aren't putting these numbers out.
[00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:27.391]  We have to collate them from other national databases.
[00:41:27.391 --> 00:41:29.112]  That's 2018.
[00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:31.673]  It's estimated crime has more than doubled since then.
[00:41:31.673 --> 00:41:33.874]  Can you imagine the real numbers?
[00:41:33.874 --> 00:41:37.556]  But just like tens of thousands dead every few months on the Texas border alone.
[00:41:37.556 --> 00:41:40.018]  Tens of thousands.
[00:41:40.018 --> 00:41:42.899]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds a month locked up in trucks to die.
[00:41:42.899 --> 00:41:44.100]  Doesn't even really make the news.
[00:41:45.731 --> 00:41:47.452]  That's how they control perception.
[00:41:47.452 --> 00:41:53.838]  And if you turn on the news, you would believe that white supremacists have attacked.
[00:41:53.838 --> 00:41:56.140]  Everybody's got to run for the hills.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.422]  That, my friends, is deception.
[00:41:58.422 --> 00:42:00.343]  All right.
[00:42:00.343 --> 00:42:04.627]  Lee in New York is a police officer on attacks and immigration getting mad.
[00:42:04.627 --> 00:42:08.030]  I'm going to go to break and come right out of the break and go right to you, Lee, I promise.
[00:42:09.508 --> 00:42:13.531]  We got Mike in Florida, who's Special Forces on the migrant attacks.
[00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.012]  Justin, Department of Defense on migrant crime.
[00:42:16.012 --> 00:42:22.036]  John is in Dallas, went to the same prison in Dallas that the Tango Blast individual's from.
[00:42:22.036 --> 00:42:24.077]  We'll talk to John as well.
[00:42:24.077 --> 00:42:25.558]  And the callers are being very disciplined.
[00:42:25.558 --> 00:42:27.520]  Normally the phone lines load up in like five seconds.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:28.820]  But they're not.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.201]  We've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[00:42:31.201 --> 00:42:41.522]  We've got more than 10 phone lines open because the listeners are being nice and not calling if you're not a police officer or don't have specific intel on this that you can tell us.
[00:42:41.522 --> 00:42:42.983]  So other police officers can get in.
[00:42:42.983 --> 00:42:47.903]  You will not hold long.
[00:42:47.903 --> 00:42:48.624]  877-789-2539.
[00:42:48.624 --> 00:42:49.604]  877-789-Alex.
[00:42:49.604 --> 00:42:50.884]  Your phone calls are straight ahead.
[00:42:50.884 --> 00:42:52.444]  This is really important.
[00:42:52.444 --> 00:42:55.425]  After I take your calls, next air I'll break down what I think is coming next.
[00:42:55.425 --> 00:42:56.445]  Now they're coming after our guns.
[00:42:56.445 --> 00:42:56.825]  Stay with us.
[00:43:00.009 --> 00:43:06.274]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:43:06.274 --> 00:43:09.256]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:43:09.256 --> 00:43:15.601]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[00:43:16.241 --> 00:43:18.783]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:43:18.783 --> 00:43:31.690]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:42.298]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:43:42.298 --> 00:43:44.659]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:50.344]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:43:50.344 --> 00:43:53.026]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:56.368]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:43:56.368 --> 00:43:57.669]  X3 back in stock.
[00:43:57.669 --> 00:43:58.730]  Take action now.
[00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.671]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:17.062]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:44:17.062 --> 00:44:19.244]  So support InfoWars Store.
[00:44:19.244 --> 00:44:27.712]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:44:27.712 --> 00:44:30.415]  And again, magnesium is critical for your
[00:44:30.855 --> 00:44:32.376]  Muscles and everything.
[00:44:32.376 --> 00:44:33.257]  Krill oil.
[00:44:33.257 --> 00:44:41.063]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:44:41.063 --> 00:44:47.068]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:44:47.068 --> 00:44:49.810]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.992]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:44:51.992 --> 00:44:53.893]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:44:53.893 --> 00:44:57.256]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:44:57.256 --> 00:44:59.278]  You have to have these products.
[00:45:00.071 --> 00:45:02.773]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[00:45:02.773 --> 00:45:07.657]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:12.961]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:22.990]  That's why I ask listeners, respectfully, to go to infoatwarstore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:29.933]  InfoWarStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[00:45:29.933 --> 00:45:39.579]  Ultimate bone broth, back in stock, nitric boost, the amazing CBD oil we have that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:41.780]  It's all available at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.121]  Some of the very best products and a lot of you
[00:45:44.121 --> 00:45:46.783]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:45:46.783 --> 00:45:48.304]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:45:48.304 --> 00:45:51.085]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:46:10.552 --> 00:46:18.637]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:46:18.637 --> 00:46:27.282]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:46:28.303 --> 00:46:31.185]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:37.728]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:40.770]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:49.014]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:46:49.634 --> 00:46:54.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Short.com.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.966]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Short.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:46:58.966 --> 00:47:00.788]  Please take action now.
[00:47:00.788 --> 00:47:06.676]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.353 --> 00:47:22.634]  All right, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[00:47:22.634 --> 00:47:24.815]  Let me just recap what's going on.
[00:47:24.815 --> 00:47:39.399]  Sources contacted me Saturday saying that the drug cartels are going to start attacking migrants to scare them from not coming across the border when Title 42 goes away, letting them know you still got to pay the cartels money or they'll kill you.
[00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:43.480]  That's what they do all the time on the Mexican side and on the U.S.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.081]  side and the media just sweeps under the rug.
[00:47:46.462 --> 00:47:52.084]  Then all this stuff starts up and the media says it's white supremacist, even though the stories don't fit.
[00:47:52.084 --> 00:47:57.927]  We're going down to the border starting Wednesday when Title 42 goes down on Thursday.
[00:47:57.927 --> 00:48:01.268]  I'll leave it at that, so pray for the operation to please support us.
[00:48:01.268 --> 00:48:05.250]  But two men with the same gang tattoos go out and do this.
[00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.411]  They focus on the shooting, not on the car attack.
[00:48:07.411 --> 00:48:10.352]  The whole thing is really stinking to high heaven.
[00:48:10.352 --> 00:48:12.953]  Now they're coming out against the Second Amendment.
[00:48:12.953 --> 00:48:14.494]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Dallas.
[00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:20.884]  In a moment, first we're going to go to Lee in New York, who says he's a police officer on the attacks, immigration getting bad.
[00:48:20.884 --> 00:48:22.645]  Then we'll go to Mike, Justin, and John.
[00:48:22.645 --> 00:48:24.046]  Go ahead, Lee, thanks for calling.
[00:48:25.103 --> 00:48:26.464]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:48:26.464 --> 00:48:31.546]  I appreciate you taking my call and salute for everything you have done for all Americans worldwide.
[00:48:31.546 --> 00:48:33.247]  Thank you, sir.
[00:48:33.247 --> 00:48:46.794]  So, I just wanted to get down on this because I see a lot of immigrants coming through, whether they're illegal or legal, and I do see that some are good, some are bad, within everything, with human groups coming in.
[00:48:46.794 --> 00:48:52.437]  But I do see that a lot of them don't have the respect for American politics,
[00:48:52.677 --> 00:48:54.699]  They don't have respect for the Constitution.
[00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:57.801]  They don't have respect if you pull out a camera and you record them.
[00:48:57.801 --> 00:49:03.205]  They have a lot of problems with the civilians flexing their rights, basically, and they don't understand that.
[00:49:03.205 --> 00:49:09.490]  So, if they're pouring in by the thousands, that looks like, basically, it's an attack to make this like a third world country.
[00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:18.978]  So, the next time there's a collapse, next time there's an economic shutdown through COVID or whatever they have planned out, there's going to be five, six times fold.
[00:49:19.477 --> 00:49:19.817]  I think so.
[00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:48.556]  And I do for sure think that black people are getting hypnotized by people like that own Universal Studios, like Lucas Grange.
[00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:51.037]  He owns all the music out here, all the drill music.
[00:49:51.037 --> 00:49:59.903]  He manages Ice Spice, Tekashi 6ix9ine, and these people work with Alex Soros, which control the politicians and the police out here as well.
[00:49:59.903 --> 00:50:06.708]  So there's a lot of things that still need to be clarified out here, and I do blame a lot of the people that are around me.
[00:50:07.248 --> 00:50:07.508]  Thank you.
[00:50:20.546 --> 00:50:23.129]  Well, you're absolutely right, and what you said is the key to this.
[00:50:23.129 --> 00:50:31.998]  It's to bring the country down, destabilize it, so when there's another crisis, we collapse, starting with the blue cities, which were once our greatest cities, meant to bring the entire country down.
[00:50:31.998 --> 00:50:40.007]  It just gave me chills what you said, and I know a lot of great New York police officers, including SWAT team people, and I'm going to leave it at that, and they're totally awake as well.
[00:50:40.007 --> 00:50:42.229]  For those who don't know, Soros runs the governor.
[00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:49.591]  He runs the mayor, he runs the DA's, he runs the prosecutors, he runs them all.
[00:50:49.591 --> 00:50:56.433]  And they even have these, quote, colleges for them, where they all get them together and launch their attacks against Trump and everybody else.
[00:50:56.433 --> 00:50:58.433]  But at least the police, on average, are awake.
[00:50:58.433 --> 00:51:01.694]  God bless you, sir, and thanks for calling.
[00:51:01.694 --> 00:51:07.575]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Mike with Special Forces on the migrant issue from Florida.
[00:51:07.575 --> 00:51:08.995]  What's your take on what we've been talking about?
[00:51:10.327 --> 00:51:20.775]  Well, Alex, I spent quite a few deployments down in Central and South America working with counter drug units, human trafficking units to curtail this.
[00:51:20.775 --> 00:51:27.520]  And where I live in Florida now, I'm retired, is probably the reddest area of the country.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:39.869]  But in the last two years, there has been this dynamic shift where you have a population that has essentially infiltrated the area and has created an entire subculture.
[00:51:40.902 --> 00:51:55.551]  And from what I see, because my background also is in surveillance, I see a lot of gang members, groups of five, groups of six, ten, that all kind of mingle together and are setting up shop, essentially.
[00:51:55.551 --> 00:52:02.636]  And things that you've mentioned before about, you know, these folks getting free phones, free debit cards.
[00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.811]  And law enforcement here is blind.
[00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:08.411]  They have no idea what is going on.
[00:52:08.411 --> 00:52:09.912]  I've tried talking to them about that.
[00:52:09.912 --> 00:52:17.174]  Like, you need to be aware that this community has now created another community within this area.
[00:52:17.174 --> 00:52:22.555]  And explain to them how Mexico fell to gangs and how government groups work with them.
[00:52:22.555 --> 00:52:23.655]  The same thing in Brazil.
[00:52:23.655 --> 00:52:25.736]  I mean, the globalists have a formula.
[00:52:25.736 --> 00:52:28.157]  This is part of a larger plan is what you're saying.
[00:52:28.157 --> 00:52:32.798]  Well, and I mean, people don't want to believe it, but there's a three-letter agency
[00:52:33.652 --> 00:52:42.175]  That has ties to all these cartels, in my opinion, along with other terrorist organizations that we helped set up.
[00:52:42.175 --> 00:52:47.317]  And that now, I mean, you could take ISIS as an example.
[00:52:47.317 --> 00:52:49.617]  It's the same tactics being used.
[00:52:49.617 --> 00:52:51.518]  Remember where ISIS got their guns?
[00:52:51.518 --> 00:53:03.042]  Holder shipped hundreds of thousands of guns to Mexico, and fast and furious, not just to blame the Second Amendment, that was a side issue, to then ship them out of Mexico into the Middle East, Libya, and Syria for that war.
[00:53:04.232 --> 00:53:17.782]  And if we don't know where those guns are now, who's to say that they're not here or coming across with these large groups of people, and especially with Title 42 getting ready to end, there's going to be a massive wave of people coming.
[00:53:17.782 --> 00:53:25.568]  And going to Walmart is a completely different experience in this area where I live compared to two years ago.
[00:53:25.568 --> 00:53:30.552]  And what the gentleman said before about they have no respect for our culture, he's absolutely right.
[00:53:30.552 --> 00:53:32.414]  They feel entitled.
[00:53:32.414 --> 00:53:34.035]  They feel like the laws do not apply to them.
[00:53:34.813 --> 00:53:37.214]  The laws are for Americans and not them.
[00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:50.579]  They're somewhat of a royalty on some type of... Well, remember the illegal aliens the UN said two years ago, pull up Reuters, quote, migrants exempt from COVID shots.
[00:53:50.579 --> 00:53:55.261]  And because, quote, there's no liability protection because the UN wasn't going to take the liability.
[00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:55.942]  They made the U.S.
[00:53:55.942 --> 00:53:56.902]  government do that.
[00:53:56.902 --> 00:54:01.004]  So, yeah, they don't take the shots when our police had to.
[00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:04.325]  Not only that, but along with the COVID,
[00:54:04.907 --> 00:54:06.868]  What are these people bringing across?
[00:54:06.868 --> 00:54:08.989]  What have they been infected with?
[00:54:08.989 --> 00:54:11.130]  You know, from the black peg in L.A.
[00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.152]  that we're seeing, like, a year ago, to other diseases.
[00:54:14.152 --> 00:54:21.075]  The one thing, if I could say, Alex, people need to get with their churches and start going and talking to other churches.
[00:54:21.075 --> 00:54:23.357]  Black, white, brown, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:23.357 --> 00:54:25.318]  But you need to start organizing.
[00:54:25.318 --> 00:54:30.400]  You need to at least create, I think Greg Reese put it out about safety committees.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.481]  Why not a neighborhood watch?
[00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:38.273]  But you need to start organizing, and you need to turn off the TV and get out of Plato's Cave, or this country's gonna fall.
[00:54:38.273 --> 00:54:38.993]  That's right.
[00:54:38.993 --> 00:54:39.873]  Sooner than we think.
[00:54:39.873 --> 00:54:45.256]  The same NGO that ran the invasion of Europe the last 12 years, for two and a half years, is in charge.
[00:54:45.256 --> 00:54:52.039]  When you go to the border, you literally see purple and green-haired leftists ordering the Border Patrol and ICE around.
[00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:54.080]  They take orders from the NGOs.
[00:54:55.248 --> 00:54:55.688]  Exactly.
[00:54:55.688 --> 00:55:01.611]  And people don't realize either that every country around the world that's going along with this, they're testing methods.
[00:55:01.611 --> 00:55:05.092]  They are testing TTPs, tactics, techniques, and procedures.
[00:55:05.092 --> 00:55:06.873]  So they see what works.
[00:55:06.873 --> 00:55:11.215]  And then they can, ultimately, this is, this is the big target.
[00:55:11.215 --> 00:55:12.675]  We are the last target.
[00:55:12.675 --> 00:55:19.538]  So they're testing all this stuff everywhere around the world, seeing what works, and they're going to bring it down here like a hammer and a nail.
[00:55:20.515 --> 00:55:24.097]  And if we don't start organizing, I'm not calling for for violence.
[00:55:24.097 --> 00:55:25.698]  I mean, I've been to war.
[00:55:25.698 --> 00:55:27.419]  It doesn't solve anything.
[00:55:27.419 --> 00:55:33.503]  Back in 2016, when I finally opened my eyes, like, what the hell are we doing here in Afghanistan?
[00:55:33.503 --> 00:55:35.825]  And my kids are Afghan.
[00:55:35.825 --> 00:55:38.707]  And it was all a scam.
[00:55:38.707 --> 00:55:41.248]  It was all a money making scam.
[00:55:41.248 --> 00:55:48.773]  And since then, I've tried to educate myself on this through, thankfully, your information.
[00:55:49.935 --> 00:55:50.396]  Absolutely.
[00:55:50.396 --> 00:55:56.062]  That's right, because the next big lockdown, the next big pandemic, I mean, the next big war is already here.
[00:55:56.062 --> 00:55:56.422]  God bless you.
[00:56:12.128 --> 00:56:17.511]  That's right, and we all feel anxiety because we can see it, but at least we know what's going on.
[00:56:17.511 --> 00:56:19.792]  But yeah, this is the takedown of America.
[00:56:19.792 --> 00:56:21.853]  This is the replacement migration.
[00:56:21.853 --> 00:56:25.075]  They're bringing in a permanent underclass that they can control.
[00:56:25.075 --> 00:56:26.876]  They snap their fingers, they burn the cities down.
[00:56:28.171 --> 00:56:33.495]  All right, we're going to go to break, and I'm going to come right back with John, Bob, Barry, Justin, and others.
[00:56:33.495 --> 00:56:34.275]  Justin's up next.
[00:56:34.275 --> 00:56:35.516]  We'll go to John.

[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.781]  We're just the football.
[00:56:42.781 --> 00:56:44.762]  You've got to carry the football down the field.

[00:56:47.664 --> 00:56:48.805]  InfoWars is just the horse, folks.

[00:57:05.434 --> 00:57:06.555]  It's essential.

[00:57:07.976 --> 00:57:09.337]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:09.337 --> 00:57:10.477]  Finally back in stock.

[00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:15.060]  Discounted as well.

[00:57:19.262 --> 00:57:19.822]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:22.964 --> 00:57:24.605]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:24.605 --> 00:57:26.906]  That's a different number than the calling number.
[00:57:26.906 --> 00:57:33.209]  That's the toll-free number to call and talk to our crew and order via the phone.
[00:57:33.209 --> 00:57:33.309]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:37.932]  Or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:37.932 --> 00:57:39.572]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:39.572 --> 00:57:40.693]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:40.693 --> 00:57:42.094]  Say a prayer for Global Awakening.
[00:57:42.094 --> 00:57:43.394]  Say a prayer for peace.
[00:57:43.394 --> 00:57:45.175]  Say a prayer for justice.

[00:57:50.128 --> 00:57:52.690]  Please give me one minute of your time.

[00:57:54.951 --> 00:57:56.952]  It will change your life.
[00:57:56.952 --> 00:58:05.718]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:58:05.718 --> 00:58:11.042]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:58:11.042 --> 00:58:12.503]  Most iodine in the environment
[00:58:13.203 --> 00:58:16.747]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:58:16.747 --> 00:58:21.211]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:58:21.211 --> 00:58:28.298]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.

[00:58:58.083 --> 00:59:03.184]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[00:59:03.184 --> 00:59:09.766]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[00:59:09.766 --> 00:59:14.326]  I want to remind you we're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.

[00:59:27.056 --> 00:59:29.739]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[00:59:29.739 --> 00:59:32.962]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[00:59:32.962 --> 00:59:35.304]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.

[00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:57.282]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.328 --> 01:00:16.550]  Alright, Justin in Virginia, Department of Defense on the migrant crime wave.
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:23.974]  I really want the callers to give me their take on what they think my analysis is, because I think it's the closest to what is probably going on.
[01:00:23.974 --> 01:00:29.497]  It fits with the cartel pattern, it fits with what's already been happening, it fits with the lies we're seeing.
[01:00:29.497 --> 01:00:35.020]  But what's on your mind, Justin, in Virginia?
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.582]  What do you think the Biden administration is doing by sending these troops to the border?
[01:00:39.582 --> 01:00:41.103]  Do you think they're trying to protect
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.562]  The only reason I can think of is why they would send troops down there to help them get in.
[01:01:07.116 --> 01:01:16.178]  But instead of building a wall, why not put two miles deep of landmines all across the border and let these people choose their own damn destiny?
[01:01:16.178 --> 01:01:27.360]  Well, the country's under invasion, and that would save lives, because again, the cartels have killed 200,000 people, the Department of Justice estimates, the last 12 years, and most of them trying to come to the border.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:34.182]  I mean, literally, they leave 53 of them here, 25 of them there, to die in 18-wheelers every week, and the media doesn't even touch it.
[01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:41.175]  Because it's not the sexy story they want, because it's not evil white people killing Hispanics, it's the drug cartels.
[01:01:41.175 --> 01:01:48.381]  Line the border with landmines, put up signs, deadly force authorized past this point, let them take care of themselves.
[01:01:52.441 --> 01:01:53.902]  It's totally sick.
[01:01:53.902 --> 01:02:01.409]  You know, if we've got tens of millions, and it's probably 8 million a year conservative right now coming across, some go back and forth.
[01:02:01.409 --> 01:02:05.853]  Imagine when Title 42 goes down, they say it's going to be like a bomb going off.
[01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:07.775]  Oh yeah, it's going to be crazy.
[01:02:07.775 --> 01:02:13.960]  And there's a lot of people that question why Trump didn't come out against the vaccine.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.582]  I understand that, but what if he's not
[01:02:17.172 --> 01:02:22.094]  Uh, it's strong enough to defend that right now, defend his point.
[01:02:22.094 --> 01:02:22.775]  No, I hear you.
[01:02:22.775 --> 01:02:28.717]  Well, that's the inside argument is he knows he screwed up, but he thinks that would then be used against him.
[01:02:28.717 --> 01:02:32.399]  So, that's really where it is.
[01:02:32.399 --> 01:02:33.519]  Right.
[01:02:33.519 --> 01:02:35.120]  Alright, appreciate you Alex, love you.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.581]  Appreciate you, love you guys too.
[01:02:36.581 --> 01:02:45.565]  Alright, let's go to John in Dallas, went to the same prison in Dallas as Tango Blast Gang that both these recent killers are reportedly part of.
[01:02:45.565 --> 01:02:46.065]  Go ahead, John.
[01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:48.550]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:49.950]  Long time listener.
[01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.731]  God bless you for calling.
[01:02:50.731 --> 01:02:52.192]  What's on your mind?
[01:02:52.192 --> 01:02:59.195]  So, I did go to prison in 2012 to 2014 and we don't put those kind of tattoos.
[01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:05.719]  We do that Dallas sign with a star, not with the leaf and not with the Texas sign.
[01:03:05.719 --> 01:03:09.181]  That is a free world tattoo, not a prison tattoo.
[01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:09.481]  Okay.
[01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:11.002]  It's not Tango Blast.
[01:03:11.002 --> 01:03:13.823]  Alright, so what's your MO on this guy?
[01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.644]  What do you think he's doing?
[01:03:15.609 --> 01:03:19.810]  I'm going to say he was just, uh, he was, I don't think he ever went to prison.
[01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:30.812]  He may have went to county a couple of times, but yes, I think he definitely maybe, uh, got compromised and, and they play with his brain and they, he carried out, he carried out this hideous mission.
[01:03:30.812 --> 01:03:31.853]  That's, that's my thought.
[01:03:31.853 --> 01:03:33.093]  Well, that's what cartels do.
[01:03:33.093 --> 01:03:42.095]  I mean, anybody that's watched the great, uh, Netflix, uh, the best super actors I've read the history, they grab you and say, we're going to kill your wife and daughter if you don't do this.
[01:03:42.095 --> 01:03:42.235]  Yeah.
[01:03:42.964 --> 01:03:50.588]  So what do you think about parasites being put into people to make them crazy and make them carry out these hits?
[01:03:50.588 --> 01:03:55.891]  Well, I know that's a Rathacon, probably the best Star Trek there is, but I don't like Star Trek.
[01:03:55.891 --> 01:03:57.151]  That's a good movie.
[01:03:57.151 --> 01:03:59.092]  I just watched the other day again.
[01:03:59.092 --> 01:04:03.575]  There are some parasites, like the one that cats have, that make people mentally ill.
[01:04:03.575 --> 01:04:04.595]  That's an interesting thought.
[01:04:04.595 --> 01:04:05.476]  What made you think of that?
[01:04:05.476 --> 01:04:11.899]  I saw something on a recent report about that, but it was a video from months ago.
[01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:16.752]  Oh, I remember Reese's Report about the parasites.
[01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:25.799]  Yeah, and then from them, it makes them more gullible and, you know, lets them mess with them easier if they're under that state of mind.
[01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:26.900]  Highly suggestible.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.742]  So you're saying you're in Puro Tango Blast?
[01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:31.844]  Puro Tango Blast.
[01:04:31.844 --> 01:04:35.627]  Tango Blast is Texans against negative gang organizations.
[01:04:35.627 --> 01:04:38.629]  We're only in Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth.
[01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:41.975]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:06.559]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:09.544]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:05:09.544 --> 01:05:15.893]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[01:05:16.514 --> 01:05:19.078]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:05:19.078 --> 01:05:31.997]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[01:05:32.638 --> 01:05:42.565]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:05:42.565 --> 01:05:44.946]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you're going to absorb it.
[01:05:44.946 --> 01:05:50.630]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:53.311]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:53.311 --> 01:05:56.654]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:05:56.654 --> 01:05:57.954]  X3 back in stock.
[01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.015]  Take action now.
[01:05:59.015 --> 01:05:59.956]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:06.172 --> 01:06:08.173]  Hour number two.
[01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.413]  Monday.
[01:06:09.413 --> 01:06:10.994]  Hey, hey.
[01:06:10.994 --> 01:06:17.517]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:26.032]  I know this.
[01:06:26.032 --> 01:06:28.314]  They're lying and saying these are white supremacists.
[01:06:28.314 --> 01:06:31.357]  They had it killed everybody up in Dallas.
[01:06:31.357 --> 01:06:32.919]  All the rest of it with no proof.
[01:06:32.919 --> 01:06:38.284]  They're suppressing the Trans Killers Manifesto in Tennessee for a month and a half.
[01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:41.748]  But boy, the FBI says this Hispanic guy's a white supremacist.
[01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:45.560]  You got this truck attacker covering up.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.981]  You got Title 42 lowering on Thursday.
[01:06:48.981 --> 01:06:51.161]  It's gone Wednesday night.
[01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:55.062]  And now the people will literally turbo surge.
[01:06:55.062 --> 01:07:00.884]  The border is reportedly up to 60,000 on the border of Mexico with El Paso.
[01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:05.625]  There's reportedly 30-40,000 in McAllen across the border about to come in.
[01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:08.266]  I mean, this is going to make all the previous surges
[01:07:09.414 --> 01:07:10.695]  Look like child's play.
[01:07:10.695 --> 01:07:13.676]  We can roll B-roll for TV viewers of just over the weekend.
[01:07:13.676 --> 01:07:18.117]  Food trucks pulling up in El Paso being just overwhelmed with people begging for food.
[01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.858]  People say, that's not America.
[01:07:19.858 --> 01:07:21.219]  Look in the lower right-hand corner.
[01:07:21.219 --> 01:07:22.999]  The truck says El Paso.
[01:07:22.999 --> 01:07:25.140]  It'll pan down in a minute.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.601]  Yes, that's out of local news.
[01:07:27.601 --> 01:07:29.542]  But most of this is not hitting the national news.
[01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:31.423]  So Biden's created such a huge problem.
[01:07:31.423 --> 01:07:32.123]  Broken the border.
[01:07:32.123 --> 01:07:34.064]  Now he's sending troops down to facilitate the whole thing.
[01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:39.150]  I want to go over the real crime statistics, how the left's trying to cause race riots again.
[01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:40.310]  I've got military news.
[01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:41.310]  I've got economy news.
[01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:42.751]  I've got AI news.
[01:07:42.751 --> 01:07:44.691]  I've got Tucker Carlson news.
[01:07:44.691 --> 01:07:47.311]  You notice what I told you when Tucker got fired a few weeks ago?
[01:07:47.311 --> 01:07:54.773]  I said, well, I'm not going to tell you my sources, but then I went through what I believe Tucker was going to do.
[01:07:54.773 --> 01:07:57.073]  Well, you can read it all today in Axios.
[01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.454]  Tucker's going to launch his own platform.
[01:07:58.454 --> 01:08:02.315]  He's talking to Elon Musk, planning to launch his own network.
[01:08:02.315 --> 01:08:04.435]  But Fox is trying to keep him off air with golden handcuffs.
[01:08:06.561 --> 01:08:09.823]  It's contracted and up until January 2025.
[01:08:09.823 --> 01:08:12.384]  Over a year and a half from now.
[01:08:12.384 --> 01:08:13.665]  Taking him out of the game.
[01:08:13.665 --> 01:08:15.746]  Will it work?
[01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:20.709]  And Tucker has now urged Fox News to permit Carlson to get a new job.
[01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:22.710]  His first public comment.
[01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:24.171]  Got that coming up.
[01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:30.055]  But I get told this stuff and can't tell you the specifics until somebody else puts it out.
[01:08:30.055 --> 01:08:30.775]  But there you go.
[01:08:30.775 --> 01:08:32.096]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:08:32.096 --> 01:08:35.338]  Let's go ahead and talk to... I told Newsmax
[01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:37.146]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.046]  Yeah, well, you know, what I see is
[01:09:03.246 --> 01:09:08.149]  They try to have our attention, obviously, on what's going on.
[01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:09.410]  It's horrendous.
[01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:10.830]  Watching these young kids.
[01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:13.472]  These young, little, innocent kids.
[01:09:13.472 --> 01:09:15.813]  My God, you know.
[01:09:15.813 --> 01:09:19.836]  They're keeping our eyes on this, but there's bigger fish being fried in the background.
[01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:21.256]  We know that.
[01:09:21.256 --> 01:09:23.718]  It's time to start really watching your communities.
[01:09:23.718 --> 01:09:25.339]  My God, I'll tell ya.
[01:09:25.339 --> 01:09:27.160]  We're so separated in this country.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.901]  I remember growing up.
[01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:37.495]  And, you know, even though you had to fight, rumble, and roll to get along in your community, when something happened, everybody pulled together.
[01:09:37.495 --> 01:09:39.595]  We don't have that now.
[01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:41.836]  We're so separated.
[01:09:41.836 --> 01:09:47.278]  It's time to really dig down, find out who is not separated and like-minded.
[01:09:47.278 --> 01:09:52.699]  Because if we let this happen, it's going to be just like watching, you know, the Holocaust.
[01:09:52.699 --> 01:09:54.220]  Obviously, they say it didn't happen.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:54.920]  Well, it happened.
[01:09:55.686 --> 01:10:06.169]  And you watch those people line up, and thousands of people, with 10, 15, 20 guards on the side with automatic weapons, being led to those train cars.
[01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:08.290]  And nobody did anything about it.
[01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:09.290]  Well, some of them did.
[01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.410]  Some of them did fight back.
[01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:11.951]  Some of them did get away.
[01:10:11.951 --> 01:10:18.913]  But now, if they all would have pulled together, half of them, not even half of them, a quarter of them would have pulled together, they could have took those guns.
[01:10:18.913 --> 01:10:20.053]  Absolutely, and I mean, look.
[01:10:22.062 --> 01:10:26.145]  Guns stop crime way more than they're used in crime.
[01:10:26.145 --> 01:10:28.146]  We need more guns to protect ourselves.
[01:10:28.146 --> 01:10:30.308]  And I'm only showing this so people understand it.
[01:10:30.308 --> 01:10:31.289]  This is a gun-free zone.
[01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:35.392]  You see that family with that little five-year-old girl with her brains blown out.
[01:10:35.392 --> 01:10:38.774]  And I'm showing this so people understand that you need to have situational awareness.
[01:10:38.774 --> 01:10:40.095]  You need to be armed.
[01:10:40.095 --> 01:10:42.997]  You need to know that this type of stuff's going on.
[01:10:42.997 --> 01:10:47.040]  And again, that is the reality of this.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.582]  And I'm sad to have to show this, but this is what's really going on.
[01:10:52.418 --> 01:10:55.779]  The system wants our guns because they want to do this to us on a mass scale.
[01:10:55.779 --> 01:11:00.602]  Again, the media doesn't care about the Mexican cartels killing hundreds of thousands of its own people.
[01:11:00.602 --> 01:11:02.462]  They want to sit there and say a white supremacist did this.
[01:11:02.462 --> 01:11:05.804]  That's because they pick and choose what they want to make a big deal about.
[01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:07.044]  We're making it all a big deal.
[01:11:07.044 --> 01:11:08.665]  It's all important.
[01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:09.245]  It is.
[01:11:09.245 --> 01:11:09.806]  It is.
[01:11:09.806 --> 01:11:10.986]  It's all a big deal.
[01:11:10.986 --> 01:11:14.808]  But you know, the problem is, is that we've all been patsies throughout history.
[01:11:14.808 --> 01:11:15.648]  You can go back.
[01:11:15.648 --> 01:11:17.089]  We fight the wars we believe.
[01:11:17.089 --> 01:11:17.649]  We die.
[01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:18.570]  For who?
[01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:19.870]  For a few men.
[01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:21.771]  A few corrupt, evil men.
[01:11:22.355 --> 01:11:23.836]  What Satan works through.
[01:11:23.836 --> 01:11:25.696]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[01:11:25.696 --> 01:11:27.657]  This is a war against good and evil.
[01:11:27.657 --> 01:11:29.958]  Now, evil's raised its ugly head.
[01:11:29.958 --> 01:11:31.619]  And we're seeing this on our own streets.
[01:11:31.619 --> 01:11:35.181]  Much like the Patriot movie, if you watch that, Alex.
[01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:37.462]  And this is what's happening right now.
[01:11:37.462 --> 01:11:45.565]  And it's obvious if, you know, what needs to happen, and I hate to say this, but it is the truth.
[01:11:45.565 --> 01:11:49.627]  You know, if there's going to be gunplay, we need to point the guns in the right direction.
[01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:51.767]  There really doesn't have to be that many shots fired.
[01:11:51.767 --> 01:11:59.773]  Well, that's why the globalists have created an atmosphere where the general public's getting killed, and then they think we'll surrender to their terrorism and give up our guns, and then it's all over.
[01:11:59.773 --> 01:12:01.414]  Thank you for the call.
[01:12:01.414 --> 01:12:10.901]  All right, let's go to Barry in Kentucky, Army, on Mexico Race War in the Media.
[01:12:10.901 --> 01:12:11.682]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:12:12.631 --> 01:12:16.332]  Hey Alex, I want to ring the bell on some pre-programming.
[01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:30.838]  If we look at Call of Duty, the recent patch, you know, back towards December, January, it is a fight in Mexico against cartels, and it implicates explosives and driving crazy and, you know, some things that we're seeing now.
[01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:37.721]  Oh, remember, the Republican senators just called to basically invade Mexico and take out the cartels over fentanyl.
[01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:40.142]  That is the number one cause of death below the age of 50 now.
[01:12:41.866 --> 01:12:55.352]  Yeah, and you know, I think it may possibly be their next glorious campaign and it would be another reason for them to go in and, you know, it's a humanitarian effort to bring more voters in at the same time as it is to play with our guns over there.
[01:12:55.352 --> 01:12:59.014]  Yeah, that would certainly make Biden look good if he went with that.
[01:12:59.014 --> 01:13:01.015]  There was enough pressure put on him.
[01:13:01.015 --> 01:13:03.656]  Yeah, and he'd have some lifetime voters thanks to it.
[01:13:03.656 --> 01:13:05.037]  So, you know, just my thought.
[01:13:05.037 --> 01:13:05.957]  So thank you.
[01:13:05.957 --> 01:13:07.118]  No, no, I think you're right on.
[01:13:07.118 --> 01:13:07.838]  Anything else you want to say?
[01:13:08.726 --> 01:13:11.948]  No, I just want to say keep your kids away from the video games.
[01:13:11.948 --> 01:13:17.711]  It's obviously an implementation of their thoughts to inherit our society to destruction.
[01:13:17.711 --> 01:13:18.211]  Absolutely.
[01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:19.131]  Great call.
[01:13:19.131 --> 01:13:20.752]  Russell in California, you're on the air.
[01:13:20.752 --> 01:13:22.713]  Navy on migrant crime flood.
[01:13:22.713 --> 01:13:24.094]  Go ahead.
[01:13:24.094 --> 01:13:25.095]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:25.095 --> 01:13:28.036]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:32.879]  Thank you for the brain force and the iodine.
[01:13:32.879 --> 01:13:36.881]  My concern is, yes, we are seeing a large influx of
[01:13:37.808 --> 01:13:47.292]  Minorities here, especially labor types that want to hang around the Home Depots and so forth here in California.
[01:13:47.292 --> 01:13:53.135]  I saw over 60 of them this weekend.
[01:13:53.135 --> 01:14:02.959]  They're Haitians, they're Hondurans, and they're competing with the Mexicans who come across the border from Tijuana.
[01:14:02.959 --> 01:14:04.860]  We also see encampments in the canyons.
[01:14:05.512 --> 01:14:10.235]  We see the encampments under the bridges.
[01:14:10.235 --> 01:14:12.416]  They're basically fish out of water.
[01:14:12.416 --> 01:14:26.163]  They're coming to a very, very expensive country with no skills, no education, and I don't know how they're going to tolerate it.
[01:14:26.744 --> 01:14:28.205]  After a certain period of time.
[01:14:28.205 --> 01:14:28.766]  Well, that's it.
[01:14:28.766 --> 01:14:30.087]  And the same thing happened in Europe.
[01:14:30.087 --> 01:14:32.769]  Now Europe's unlivable tourism is down 80%.
[01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:35.851]  The government deliberately destroyed Europe on purpose.
[01:14:35.851 --> 01:14:36.411]  And it's being done.
[01:14:36.411 --> 01:14:38.573]  We're being destroyed.
[01:14:38.573 --> 01:14:40.634]  That's true.
[01:14:40.634 --> 01:14:51.342]  And another thing that came out of some friends of mine who are in high places is that they're afraid of another 9-11 event for the Democrats with
[01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:58.385]  With the competitor for the Democratic Party and Donald Trump.
[01:14:58.385 --> 01:15:03.016]  They have to do something and it's probably going to happen on the anniversary of 9-11.
[01:15:04.951 --> 01:15:10.536]  Well, I agree that they're going to stage major terror attacks and blame the Republicans somehow.
[01:15:10.536 --> 01:15:15.020]  I mean, look, the whole world's crazy right now, and that's the only card they've got left.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:19.323]  And so I believe what we're seeing is probably the beginning of that.
[01:15:19.323 --> 01:15:24.807]  And it makes sense what Pete Santilli's source is saying, that the cartels make $10 billion a year off this.
[01:15:24.807 --> 01:15:27.390]  They don't want it cut off, so they want Title 42 put back in.
[01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:37.592]  Because, quote, they're going to start targeting people and killing them, and if they kill the migrants, the illegals coming in, then they'll let them know, the cartels, see you didn't pay us, so we're going to kill a bunch of you.
[01:15:37.592 --> 01:15:40.073]  Which is what they do all the time anyways.
[01:15:40.073 --> 01:15:40.813]  Yeah.
[01:15:40.813 --> 01:15:53.715]  Yeah, and like I said, once you have a population that can't support itself here in our country, who knows what avenues they're going to take to go for their survival.
[01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:54.936]  Great point!
[01:15:54.936 --> 01:15:56.576]  Yep, they're creating a road warrior scenario.
[01:15:59.036 --> 01:16:01.598]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:16:01.598 --> 01:16:03.860]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.861]  It will change your life.
[01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:14.608]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:16:14.608 --> 01:16:19.932]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:16:19.932 --> 01:16:21.414]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:16:22.094 --> 01:16:25.658]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:16:25.658 --> 01:16:30.122]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:16:30.122 --> 01:16:37.209]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:16:37.209 --> 01:16:43.215]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:16:43.715 --> 01:16:46.136]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:16:46.136 --> 01:16:48.398]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:16:48.398 --> 01:16:50.178]  You and your family need it.
[01:16:50.178 --> 01:16:51.939]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:16:51.939 --> 01:16:52.860]  X3.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:56.142]  Try iodine exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[01:16:56.142 --> 01:16:59.243]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:16:59.243 --> 01:17:05.387]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:17:06.147 --> 01:17:15.134]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:17:15.134 --> 01:17:17.976]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:17:17.976 --> 01:17:21.279]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:17:21.279 --> 01:17:29.265]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:17:29.785 --> 01:17:34.608]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:46.134]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:17:46.134 --> 01:17:52.197]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.965]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:18:04.965 --> 01:18:07.607]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:18:07.607 --> 01:18:09.789]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:18:09.789 --> 01:18:12.391]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:18:12.391 --> 01:18:15.614]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:18:15.614 --> 01:18:17.376]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:18:17.376 --> 01:18:24.001]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:26.784]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:29.866]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:18:29.866 --> 01:18:34.490]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:38.232]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:18:38.232 --> 01:18:41.354]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:18:41.354 --> 01:18:43.896]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:18:43.896 --> 01:18:45.257]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:18:45.257 --> 01:18:51.041]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer and your financial support while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:52.401]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:53.742]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:53.742 --> 01:18:57.685]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:18:58.845 --> 01:19:01.867]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:06.649]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:11.751]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer, and our products are not any different.
[01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:18.334]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try, if you've never tried them, or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[01:19:18.334 --> 01:19:22.896]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:19:22.896 --> 01:19:26.057]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[01:19:26.497 --> 01:19:28.138]  You want to go research.
[01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:34.242]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[01:19:34.242 --> 01:19:35.623]  But they're selling out quick.
[01:19:35.623 --> 01:19:38.285]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[01:19:38.285 --> 01:19:41.527]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.869]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[01:19:43.869 --> 01:19:44.969]  It's about to sell out.
[01:19:44.969 --> 01:19:52.675]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:19:52.675 --> 01:19:53.755]  Thank you for your support.
[01:20:00.684 --> 01:20:06.593]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:32.593]  The global controllers have decided there's too many people on the earth.
[01:20:32.593 --> 01:20:38.297]  They've decided to launch a controlled demolition of civilization.
[01:20:38.297 --> 01:20:48.745]  Out of that cascading train of disasters, they will pose as the saviors and bring in their biomedical transhumanist tyranny.
[01:20:48.745 --> 01:20:54.609]  That's what they write about, it's what they say, it's what they give speeches on at TED Talks and Bill Gates and
[01:20:56.138 --> 01:20:57.679]  Harari.
[01:20:57.679 --> 01:21:00.121]  You walk in a bookstore, there's in-caps everywhere with their books.
[01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.243]  This is their plan.
[01:21:02.243 --> 01:21:08.008]  And what's so frustrating is, I had a chance to join them, repeatedly.
[01:21:08.008 --> 01:21:11.951]  But I decided to bet on humanity and not be part of this.
[01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:22.519]  But I can look at the fallen state of humanity and say, well, once this all gets too out of control, most of these people are going to have to die because there won't be resources.
[01:21:22.519 --> 01:21:24.261]  So we're already so deep into this,
[01:21:25.899 --> 01:21:38.107]  But what I want the middle class to know, and what I want really wealthy people to know, is I think you're smart enough to understand that you're not safe in this climate either, and that's why there's some backing away from the New World Order right now.
[01:21:38.107 --> 01:21:43.691]  That's why there's a lot of powerful people saying, hey, let's not do this.
[01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:54.939]  I saw reports last week, I sent it to the crew, I'm sure it was on my stack, I never found it, but, hold up, Xi Jinping declares emergency over Chinese demographics, and tells the population to have three children.
[01:21:55.998 --> 01:22:02.743]  Now back when China was on a globalist leash, to be given all the industry and power, they had to only have one child.
[01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:03.744]  That was a globalist policy.
[01:22:03.744 --> 01:22:09.629]  Now their society is falling apart, because you've got to have enough people to replace those that die.
[01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:21.979]  And we're replacing with totally uneducated, third world populations from around the world, predominantly military age young men.
[01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:25.442]  No education, had horrible nutrition as children,
[01:22:26.345 --> 01:22:31.450]  Which means white, black, hispanic, small brains.
[01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:34.293]  And it's a disaster.
[01:22:34.293 --> 01:22:38.417]  So the replacement migration we've got is not the best of all these countries, it's the worst.
[01:22:40.725 --> 01:22:43.806]  Yeah, that's from a few years ago when they shifted policies, BBC.
[01:22:43.806 --> 01:22:45.867]  China lost three children in a major policy shift.
[01:22:45.867 --> 01:22:47.427]  It was just last week.
[01:22:47.427 --> 01:22:51.148]  Xi Jinping holds meeting on emergency of country's demographics.
[01:22:51.148 --> 01:22:51.868]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:22:51.868 --> 01:22:52.689]  Print that for me.
[01:22:52.689 --> 01:22:53.649]  Fox News.
[01:22:53.649 --> 01:22:56.930]  China's Xi in a panic over coming population crisis.
[01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:00.611]  We will be more proactive, more belligerent.
[01:23:03.868 --> 01:23:08.231]  China's population is still headed towards collapse despite government offering financial incentives.
[01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:11.234]  But our government more and more tells you don't have children.
[01:23:11.234 --> 01:23:13.595]  Elon Musk says do have children.
[01:23:13.595 --> 01:23:23.723]  But I don't care if you are a intelligent, successful, that means just able to take care of your family and your children are doing well and you love God, that means you're successful.
[01:23:23.723 --> 01:23:26.786]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[01:23:26.786 --> 01:23:28.887]  But we know that's not what we're doing right now.
[01:23:28.887 --> 01:23:31.449]  We are screwed up.
[01:23:31.449 --> 01:23:33.571]  And the globalists have decided to take us out like the garbage.
[01:23:35.998 --> 01:23:42.783]  But I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if I actually went to New York, met Henry Kissinger, went to work for them.
[01:23:42.783 --> 01:23:43.864]  What would they have me do?
[01:23:43.864 --> 01:23:48.147]  What would I be right now?
[01:23:48.147 --> 01:23:51.609]  Because just even listening to it made me feel soulless.
[01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:53.551]  God wants me to fight for the people.
[01:23:53.551 --> 01:23:59.075]  God wants us to fix the problems and lift up the weak, not kill them.
[01:23:59.075 --> 01:24:05.059]  But it's going to get so out of hand, folks, to protect yourself, you're going to get to a point where you're going to have to defend yourself.
[01:24:06.104 --> 01:24:07.826]  This is the end of civilization as we know it.
[01:24:07.826 --> 01:24:13.633]  Alright, I was only taking calls from specifically law enforcement and military.
[01:24:13.633 --> 01:24:15.355]  Now I'm going to take calls from everybody.
[01:24:15.355 --> 01:24:16.256]  First time callers though.
[01:24:17.637 --> 01:24:21.439]  But I'll put you ahead of the line if you're on the border, if you've witnessed any of this, give us your take.
[01:24:21.439 --> 01:24:32.147]  If you're in El Paso, or McAllen, or Brownsville, or Southern California, or Southern Arizona, or maybe in your small town, what you're seeing with the illegals that are just stacked up everywhere.
[01:24:32.147 --> 01:24:39.011]  I drive around the country, little random towns now, there's just illegals everywhere, wandering around, no jobs, no nothing.
[01:24:39.011 --> 01:24:46.296]  Building their camp cities, their tent cities, and then all the drugged out Americans of every race, color, and creed, just stumbling around, peeing on themselves.
[01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:55.070]  I saw feces on the ground twice in one day, Saturday.
[01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:56.990]  Twice.
[01:24:56.990 --> 01:25:00.051]  I mean, it's just, it's just the breakdown of society.
[01:25:00.051 --> 01:25:03.392]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539 on this big subject, but we can also bring up all the other subjects.
[01:25:03.392 --> 01:25:03.512]  Wow.
[01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.151]  We've got a lot of military news.
[01:25:16.151 --> 01:25:17.491]  We've got big censorship news.
[01:25:17.491 --> 01:25:21.492]  We've got massive fentanyl news.
[01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:26.074]  We've got huge news dealing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:25:26.074 --> 01:25:28.415]  We've got the crime statistic news.
[01:25:28.415 --> 01:25:39.759]  But something I really had, not an epiphany, but just a real understanding of this weekend, was the AI and how it's being rolled out and what the system's saying and what they're doing and how they're couching it.
[01:25:39.759 --> 01:25:42.880]  That, oh, we want to protect you from the AI and Google wants to protect you now.
[01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:50.507]  And I really thought about my deep research on AI and all the top sources that we've talked to, what's really going on with it.
[01:25:50.507 --> 01:25:54.169]  And I've got some really chilling information for you.
[01:25:54.169 --> 01:25:56.130]  And I guess today's the day to talk about that.
[01:25:56.130 --> 01:26:10.496]  So crew, remind me the start of the next hour to do 10 minutes on AI and what it really means and where it's all going.
[01:26:10.496 --> 01:26:11.497]  So we'll do that as well.
[01:26:14.278 --> 01:26:27.823]  But again, recapping, you have this Hispanic gentleman, I say that lightly, gentleman, person, killing all these innocent people in North Dallas, and the media call him a white supremacist.
[01:26:27.823 --> 01:26:31.164]  That fits into all the fake crime statistics.
[01:26:31.164 --> 01:26:36.526]  They don't show the evidence of it, they suppress the trans activists killing people.
[01:26:36.526 --> 01:26:39.887]  This is just such a level of lying.
[01:26:39.887 --> 01:26:42.748]  And when it's so unified, how do you counter something like that?
[01:26:43.663 --> 01:26:57.966]  When the people going along with this are destroying themselves in the process, it is quite the realization to say the least.
[01:26:57.966 --> 01:26:59.586]  But boy is it going to be incredible.
[01:26:59.586 --> 01:27:08.028]  We're going to be on the ground Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday in El Paso.
[01:27:11.758 --> 01:27:18.779]  And nobody is going to want to miss the reportage that we're going to be giving you.
[01:27:18.779 --> 01:27:20.820]  And we're going to be busy little beavers.
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.300]  We have a lot of whistleblowers, insiders.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:29.762]  You know, the big story here is it's not just millions coming across every year, tens of millions every couple years.
[01:27:29.762 --> 01:27:35.123]  It is the fact that they're being lured here by the government and that the Texas sector alone
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.642]  30,000 children have been handed over to pedophiles or people with sex crime histories.
[01:27:41.642 --> 01:27:46.204]  20,000 pedophiles released just the last two years by the Texas sector.
[01:27:46.204 --> 01:27:48.305]  And that's internal numbers.
[01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:51.887]  Some of it's come out in the news, but I have that from very high levels.
[01:27:51.887 --> 01:28:01.452]  Like you've got the director of ICE, Mayorkas, and you've got the top tier of people.
[01:28:01.452 --> 01:28:04.413]  Like it's the very top, below the head.
[01:28:06.255 --> 01:28:14.800]  It's beyond the head of the union, we got all that, and that's, we're talking to all those people.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.182]  And you see the moral people in the federal government, the FBI agents and the federal marshals, just look like they saw a ghost.
[01:28:20.182 --> 01:28:24.545]  They're just like, this is organized child trafficking run by the government.
[01:28:24.545 --> 01:28:26.006]  You see it in congressional hearings, they say that too.
[01:28:26.006 --> 01:28:29.948]  I mean, this is, they're coming to grips with, man, these people are really bad.
[01:28:29.948 --> 01:28:32.249]  And they're directing people to do things that are illegal.
[01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:38.586]  Because it's Merrick Garland decides who to prosecute.
[01:28:38.586 --> 01:28:41.268]  And these high-level federal officials say, hey, we've got to prosecute this guy.
[01:28:41.268 --> 01:28:45.872]  He's a five-time deported, three-time child molester, raping small children.
[01:28:45.872 --> 01:28:46.953]  They go, nope.
[01:28:46.953 --> 01:28:47.634]  Misdemeanor.
[01:28:47.634 --> 01:28:49.296]  Let him go in two months.
[01:28:49.296 --> 01:28:52.238]  We don't let you put them in jail.
[01:28:52.238 --> 01:28:53.980]  I mean, that's an evil-ass government right there.
[01:28:58.902 --> 01:29:05.184]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:29:05.184 --> 01:29:08.145]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:29:08.145 --> 01:29:17.689]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:19.630]  The number one preventable cause
[01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:31.253]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[01:29:31.253 --> 01:29:41.196]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:29:41.196 --> 01:29:43.557]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:29:43.557 --> 01:29:46.618]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[01:29:47.358 --> 01:29:47.778]  That's right.
[01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:14.417]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:30:14.417 --> 01:30:19.761]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:30:19.761 --> 01:30:21.223]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:30:21.923 --> 01:30:25.465]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:30:25.465 --> 01:30:29.927]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:30:29.927 --> 01:30:37.010]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:43.013]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:43.593 --> 01:30:45.957]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.

[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:50.003]  You and your family need it.
[01:30:50.003 --> 01:30:51.766]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:30:51.766 --> 01:30:53.629]  X3 Tri-Iodine.

[01:31:06.786 --> 01:31:11.887]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[01:31:11.887 --> 01:31:18.469]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[01:31:18.469 --> 01:31:23.029]  I want to remind you we're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:31:23.029 --> 01:31:26.190]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,

[01:31:28.311 --> 01:31:34.376]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[01:31:34.376 --> 01:31:35.756]  But they're selling out quick.
[01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:38.438]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[01:31:38.438 --> 01:31:41.661]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[01:31:41.661 --> 01:31:44.803]  But in a week or so, instead of going back to full price, it's about to sell out.

[01:31:52.808 --> 01:32:03.976]  Thank you for your support.
[01:32:03.976 --> 01:32:05.377]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:32:05.377 --> 01:32:07.278]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:32:07.278 --> 01:32:07.879]  It is!
[01:32:07.879 --> 01:32:09.460]  But if you took it with bish oil...
[01:32:10.732 --> 01:32:12.753]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:32:12.753 --> 01:32:14.093]  The fish oil's better than it.
[01:32:14.093 --> 01:32:15.914]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:32:15.914 --> 01:32:18.415]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:32:18.415 --> 01:32:20.035]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:21.516]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:32:21.516 --> 01:32:22.996]  Krill oil is the best.
[01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:24.357]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:32:24.357 --> 01:32:25.077]  And I'm sorry.
[01:32:25.077 --> 01:32:26.197]  You want something like this?
[01:32:26.197 --> 01:32:27.178]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:32:27.178 --> 01:32:29.098]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:32:29.098 --> 01:32:29.718]  It's so good.
[01:32:29.718 --> 01:32:30.319]  In my view.
[01:32:30.319 --> 01:32:32.659]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:32:32.659 --> 01:32:35.360]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.941]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:32:38.723 --> 01:32:46.226]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:32:46.226 --> 01:32:52.268]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:32:52.268 --> 01:32:53.409]  I just can't do it!
[01:32:53.409 --> 01:33:00.652]  InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:33:00.652 --> 01:33:06.534]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.117 --> 01:33:24.962]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.962 --> 01:33:35.450]  They started the poison shots more than two years ago.
[01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:45.358]  But there was one group in Europe, one group in Asia, one group in the Americas, one group in Australia, that the government said, no need, they don't have to have a shot, they can do whatever they want.
[01:33:46.809 --> 01:33:56.516]  And that was the illegal aliens given debit cards by the UN, by the State Department, by other governments, thousands and thousands of dollars, thousands and thousands of euros to be brought into our countries.
[01:33:56.516 --> 01:34:04.742]  And that's because they're going to send them off to Democrats and Socialists and other leftist parties to be slave labor, to be sex slaves, to sign up with them.
[01:34:04.742 --> 01:34:05.963]  They take part of their paycheck.
[01:34:05.963 --> 01:34:07.444]  They take part of their welfare.
[01:34:07.444 --> 01:34:08.305]  They farm them.
[01:34:08.305 --> 01:34:10.066]  That's all come out.
[01:34:10.066 --> 01:34:11.227]  Here's Reuters.
[01:34:11.227 --> 01:34:14.790]  Refugees lack COVID shots because drug makers fear lawsuits.
[01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:15.671]  Documents show.
[01:34:15.671 --> 01:34:15.971]  Reuters.
[01:34:17.073 --> 01:34:19.816]  They got all our governments to sign on for liability protection.
[01:34:19.816 --> 01:34:25.521]  The hospitals know how to cover it up when you have a stroke or heart attack or die, or myocarditis.
[01:34:25.521 --> 01:34:28.344]  But with them, those are their cash cows.
[01:34:28.344 --> 01:34:30.926]  They're not going to hurt them until later.
[01:34:30.926 --> 01:34:34.450]  That's the cold-blooded scientific level of this control.
[01:34:35.868 --> 01:34:39.290]  Globalists know exactly what they're doing.
[01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:40.271]  There's the Washington Post.
[01:34:40.271 --> 01:34:42.993]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[01:34:42.993 --> 01:34:44.594]  Senate report confirms.
[01:34:44.594 --> 01:34:45.614]  That's from 2016.
[01:34:45.614 --> 01:34:47.876]  Six and a half years ago.
[01:34:47.876 --> 01:34:49.677]  All right, we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:34:49.677 --> 01:34:51.898]  I'm going to move quickly through your phone calls.
[01:34:51.898 --> 01:34:54.780]  The next hour, I'm going to blitz through a ton of news and big breaking stuff we've got.
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:58.442]  There's so much here lined up, but I want to get to your calls.
[01:34:58.442 --> 01:35:00.804]  Let's go ahead and go to Taylor in Texas.
[01:35:00.804 --> 01:35:01.364]  You're on the air.
[01:35:01.364 --> 01:35:03.045]  Thanks for holding.
[01:35:03.045 --> 01:35:03.906]  How you doing, sir?
[01:35:05.276 --> 01:35:09.980]  Alright, so I just wanted to fill in some stuff about the incident in Brownsville.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.243]  I have a channel called RGV Truth.
[01:35:12.243 --> 01:35:14.845]  It's on Rumble, also Facebook, and everything else.
[01:35:14.845 --> 01:35:19.109]  I released a video yesterday I got from a PD contact, from a police contact.
[01:35:19.522 --> 01:35:21.404]  And that has all the gory video.
[01:35:21.404 --> 01:35:23.926]  I don't know how much is actually out there for the mainstream.
[01:35:23.926 --> 01:35:27.869]  I've been up all night, you know, putting videos together, getting stuff from people.
[01:35:27.869 --> 01:35:30.451]  But this guy was a Baluco gang member.
[01:35:30.451 --> 01:35:40.258]  If you look at the picture of him in the hospital bed, you'll see he's got a Willoughby, Hidalgo, and Starr County portrait on his stomach with the palm tree.
[01:35:40.258 --> 01:35:44.542]  So that would be his gang affiliation.
[01:35:44.542 --> 01:35:46.023]  Also, when he was
[01:35:46.545 --> 01:35:56.387]  At 17 years old in 2005, he got a $2 million settlement from Brownsville PD for a wrongful coercion of guilt for an assault on a police officer.
[01:35:56.387 --> 01:35:58.307]  So there's a lot of stuff I've been seeing about this guy.
[01:35:58.307 --> 01:36:01.368]  There's also some eyewitness reports.
[01:36:01.368 --> 01:36:12.390]  Numbia Chapa said that her parents saw him almost crash into several cars on Minnesota and California Avenue, which is a few intersections before where he was by the bus stop.
[01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:15.691]  And there's also, I cannot confirm this report, I have another guy saying that
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:24.503]  He saw a post somewhere where this guy, Alvarez, the driver, went past that bus stop cussing at the IAs.
[01:36:24.503 --> 01:36:43.811]  So, um, the other thing that I'm not seeing the mainstream media covering, and I have a video out also, it's on Facebook, of the, right after the accident, after Alvarez is out of the SUV, a group of the Venezuelan IAs beat the crap out of him, kick him, and as soon as you can kind of see the police cars come and go, okay, okay, stop.
[01:36:44.304 --> 01:36:47.085]  So, I think the only video that... Well, I'd beat the hell out of him, too.
[01:36:47.085 --> 01:36:48.466]  Let's show that footage again.
[01:36:48.466 --> 01:36:51.627]  He literally just plows through the people.
[01:36:51.627 --> 01:36:52.068]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:52.068 --> 01:36:52.968]  And legs are missing.
[01:36:52.968 --> 01:36:54.709]  I mean, little kids, ninas.
[01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:56.049]  I mean, just, strewn about.
[01:36:56.049 --> 01:37:00.531]  It's, uh... These people should not be in this country at all, but they don't deserve to end their lives like that.
[01:37:00.531 --> 01:37:03.473]  They're just all... Well, it sounds like you're on the job.
[01:37:03.473 --> 01:37:04.493]  Again, what's your channel again?
[01:37:04.493 --> 01:37:06.114]  We want to pull your videos up.
[01:37:06.114 --> 01:37:06.794]  RGV Truth.
[01:37:06.794 --> 01:37:07.995]  It's all one word.
[01:37:07.995 --> 01:37:09.896]  Everything's going to be on Rumble.
[01:37:09.896 --> 01:37:11.396]  I'm releasing a new video today.
[01:37:11.396 --> 01:37:12.677]  I just activated the Tea Party.
[01:37:12.677 --> 01:37:13.037]  I have been
[01:37:13.544 --> 01:37:18.847]  Exposing a New World Order globalist NGO down here that's been doing kids drag shows.
[01:37:18.847 --> 01:37:20.088]  I've gotten the grassroots behind me.
[01:37:20.088 --> 01:37:20.949]  Oh wow, incredible.
[01:37:20.949 --> 01:37:21.869]  So I've heard of you before.
[01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:23.670]  It's RGB Truth?
[01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:24.371]  Yes sir.
[01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:24.711]  Yes sir.
[01:37:24.711 --> 01:37:27.593]  We were, I used to be with a group called the True Patriots.
[01:37:27.593 --> 01:37:30.254]  I think you guys had us, yeah.
[01:37:30.254 --> 01:37:31.535]  Owen was down there.
[01:37:31.535 --> 01:37:34.237]  So they're getting the migrant children and putting them in the pedo shows?
[01:37:35.547 --> 01:37:39.369]  Oh, sir, it's wilder than anything you can think of.
[01:37:39.369 --> 01:37:44.992]  It all leads back to a pizza restaurant that is very heavily involved with kids in Alamo called The Landmark.
[01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:50.315]  I actually, unprecedented, I exposed these pedos.
[01:37:50.315 --> 01:37:54.337]  I went to, basically put out all these videos.
[01:37:54.337 --> 01:37:56.798]  They got so perturbed by it, they made a call to action.
[01:37:56.798 --> 01:38:00.960]  They went to the Alamo, this is the city that it happened in, Alamo, right here on the border.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.821]  They went to that city hall.
[01:38:03.354 --> 01:38:09.560]  And they pretty much told all of City Hall, everybody, that if you have a problem with what we're doing, you're the problem.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.245]  And they completely turned the valley and everybody off of anything to do with this kids' drag or anything like that.
[01:38:14.245 --> 01:38:18.289]  Anybody who had any holdings back before knew exactly what they're doing now.
[01:38:18.289 --> 01:38:18.629]  Wow.
[01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:19.990]  Alright.
[01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:21.372]  We'll check your info out.
[01:38:21.372 --> 01:38:21.992]  Thank you, sir.
[01:38:21.992 --> 01:38:23.193]  Incredible call.
[01:38:23.193 --> 01:38:24.314]  Angus in Pennsylvania.
[01:38:24.314 --> 01:38:24.575]  Go ahead.
[01:38:26.502 --> 01:38:27.443]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:29.986]  Um, um, I wanted to talk about two things.
[01:38:29.986 --> 01:38:39.835]  I wanted to talk about the, uh, I wanted to talk about the, um, uh, the 5% rule, uh, which is kind of a term I made up.
[01:38:39.835 --> 01:38:43.599]  And then I also wanted to talk about how to deal with the drug cartels.
[01:38:43.599 --> 01:38:46.622]  Here's what I come up with the 5% rule.
[01:38:46.622 --> 01:38:50.286]  Since these people were so interested in DNA and genetics,
[01:38:50.666 --> 01:39:04.040]  So interested in DNA and genetics, let's test these people and find out which ones are the craziest, and let's get their DNA checked so we can find out the looms once we get them out of the way.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.842]  Now, that's the 5% rule.
[01:39:05.842 --> 01:39:12.449]  If you have 5% of that DNA in you, then you have to go and be quarantined for the safety of the public.
[01:39:12.449 --> 01:39:13.210]  Okay, now,
[01:39:13.730 --> 01:39:17.573]  Secondly, I wanted to speak about the drug cartels.
[01:39:17.573 --> 01:39:19.114]  Okay, here goes what I come up with.
[01:39:19.114 --> 01:39:26.860]  In South Central Los Angeles, they have been fighting, the Mexicans and the Bloods and Crips have been fighting.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.601]  So here's what I say.
[01:39:28.601 --> 01:39:39.028]  Okay, how about some interested people with money support black people to kill these people and get them to fight each other since they like division so much.
[01:39:39.028 --> 01:39:39.909]  That would be nice.
[01:39:40.169 --> 01:39:42.270]  And here's another thing I would say.
[01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:52.857]  First of all, support Alex Jones, support InfoWars, and never mix TurboForce with root beer and sherbet ice cream and vodka.
[01:39:52.857 --> 01:39:54.418]  Because you know what'll happen?
[01:39:54.418 --> 01:39:56.379]  You'll go bonkers!
[01:39:56.379 --> 01:39:57.060]  Bunkertown!
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.221]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:59.221 --> 01:40:02.783]  I don't really agree with that, some of those things.
[01:40:02.783 --> 01:40:04.284]  And I think that was a prank caller.
[01:40:04.284 --> 01:40:05.885]  Let's go to Steve in Alaska.
[01:40:05.885 --> 01:40:06.626]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:40:08.271 --> 01:40:09.211]  Hello.
[01:40:09.211 --> 01:40:09.431]  Welcome.
[01:40:09.431 --> 01:40:10.151]  You hear me?
[01:40:10.151 --> 01:40:11.332]  Yes.
[01:40:11.332 --> 01:40:11.592]  Okay.
[01:40:11.592 --> 01:40:12.832]  I had to get you off speakerphone.
[01:40:12.832 --> 01:40:13.012]  Yeah.
[01:40:13.012 --> 01:40:21.254]  I did a lot of stupid stuff when I was younger and I ended up doing three stretches in prison between California and Colorado.
[01:40:21.254 --> 01:40:24.034]  And, you know, I ran with a lot of Mexicans.
[01:40:24.034 --> 01:40:26.515]  My godchildren are actually half Mexican, half Cuban.
[01:40:26.515 --> 01:40:36.117]  And of course I ran with a lot of whites at friends and pretty much all colors, but I've never ever in my tour of duty in the lower pits of hell,
[01:40:38.292 --> 01:40:42.456]  I'm sorry, that's not truth.
[01:40:42.456 --> 01:40:45.119]  Anybody that believes that that's truth is blinded.
[01:40:45.119 --> 01:40:49.062]  Let me just add this so you can make your point.
[01:40:49.062 --> 01:40:57.251]  Every major news site that's mainstream says it was a white supremacist Hispanic with no evidence that attacked Hispanics and killed them.
[01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:58.292]  I mean, who believes that?
[01:40:59.144 --> 01:41:01.746]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, you know.
[01:41:01.746 --> 01:41:08.892]  If they're Mexican and they're proud, they're probably a part of, like, La Raza as either a militant or non-militant.
[01:41:08.892 --> 01:41:10.874]  I mean, they're proud of their own heritage.
[01:41:10.874 --> 01:41:13.896]  Mexicans by and whole are proud of their heritage.
[01:41:13.896 --> 01:41:14.657]  They're good people.
[01:41:14.657 --> 01:41:16.358]  They're great people.
[01:41:16.358 --> 01:41:23.504]  These cartels, however, they work hand-in-hand with the CIA, and if anybody doesn't know that, they don't understand it.
[01:41:23.504 --> 01:41:24.946]  The CIA's been dealing drugs.
[01:41:24.946 --> 01:41:26.527]  The only reason why there's a war on drugs
[01:41:26.983 --> 01:41:38.548]  Because the CIA wants to control the drugs coming into America, so they make the money and then they're hand-in-hand with the cartels, which of course is hand-in-hand with the bankers and it goes all the way through the politicians.
[01:41:38.548 --> 01:41:39.648]  Just follow the money.
[01:41:39.648 --> 01:41:42.209]  It's easy.
[01:41:42.209 --> 01:41:42.849]  Absolutely.
[01:41:42.849 --> 01:41:47.531]  So why would this guy get out of a car and shoot a bunch of Hispanics he saw congregated?
[01:41:47.531 --> 01:41:56.475]  Well, you know, you've had a lot of theories put out there, like everything from maybe his family's kidnapped, maybe he's a soldier, I mean some of these guys
[01:41:57.157 --> 01:41:59.919]  Um, who are part of the cartels, uh, are soldiers.
[01:41:59.919 --> 01:42:02.101]  And when they're giving orders, they go ahead and do them.
[01:42:02.101 --> 01:42:03.542]  And there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:42:03.542 --> 01:42:11.969]  And it doesn't matter, like, if you're in the joint, for instance, and they give you an order to go put a knife in somebody and kill them, it doesn't matter if you're going to the hole for the next 20 years.
[01:42:11.969 --> 01:42:13.491]  They'll go and do it.
[01:42:13.491 --> 01:42:21.177]  You're a soldier, and they understand that because the other side of that coin is if you don't do that, then you're next on the list.
[01:42:21.733 --> 01:42:26.695]  And that's what a lot of people don't really understand about these people.
[01:42:26.695 --> 01:42:32.877]  It's not like a military soldier where they give you an order and if you don't follow it, you get a court-martial and go to jail, maybe.
[01:42:32.877 --> 01:42:33.957]  They'll kill you.
[01:42:33.957 --> 01:42:36.958]  And that's no joke.
[01:42:36.958 --> 01:42:37.718]  Dead serious.
[01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:41.019]  Let me tell you, these extreme gangs need to be eradicated.
[01:42:41.019 --> 01:42:44.080]  We need to turn the military loose on them and kill all their leadership.
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.481]  I'm sick of this crap.
[01:42:45.481 --> 01:42:46.721]  Alright, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:42:46.721 --> 01:42:47.381]  God bless you.
[01:42:47.381 --> 01:42:48.281]  Really powerful.
[01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:49.282]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:42:49.282 --> 01:42:49.722]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.059 --> 01:43:04.082]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[01:43:04.082 --> 01:43:06.243]  We made it even stronger.
[01:43:06.243 --> 01:43:09.985]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:43:09.985 --> 01:43:16.889]  TurboForce is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:43:16.889 --> 01:43:22.972]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:43:22.972 --> 01:43:24.373]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:43:25.053 --> 01:43:38.121]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:43:38.121 --> 01:43:40.122]  It is the super fuel.
[01:43:40.122 --> 01:43:41.583]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:43:41.583 --> 01:43:42.443]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:43:42.443 --> 01:43:43.404]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:43:43.404 --> 01:43:44.605]  They go good with this.
[01:43:44.605 --> 01:43:46.606]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:43:47.344 --> 01:43:48.828]  This is the Boss.
[01:43:48.828 --> 01:43:49.550]  TurboForce.
[01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:50.593]  Back in stock.
[01:43:50.593 --> 01:43:51.595]  Discounted.
[01:43:51.595 --> 01:43:53.340]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:54.202]  More power.
[01:43:54.202 --> 01:43:55.205]  More strength.
[01:43:55.205 --> 01:43:55.706]  More energy.
[01:43:58.823 --> 01:44:06.249]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[01:44:06.249 --> 01:44:09.071]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:44:09.071 --> 01:44:17.418]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:19.860]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.863]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[01:44:23.163 --> 01:44:25.724]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:44:25.724 --> 01:44:34.127]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[01:44:34.127 --> 01:44:35.988]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:44:35.988 --> 01:44:43.071]  government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:44:43.071 --> 01:44:48.273]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:44:48.273 --> 01:44:51.694]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[01:44:52.875 --> 01:45:03.203]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:45:03.203 --> 01:45:06.886]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:45:06.886 --> 01:45:09.308]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:45:09.308 --> 01:45:11.690]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:14.213]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:45:14.993 --> 01:45:19.494]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:45:19.494 --> 01:45:22.875]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:45:22.875 --> 01:45:26.916]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:45:26.916 --> 01:45:29.257]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[01:45:29.257 --> 01:45:30.057]  It just happened.
[01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:32.278]  We need to go into the capital!
[01:45:32.278 --> 01:45:32.918]  That's it!
[01:45:34.799 --> 01:45:36.940]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.561]  They are nothing but distraction.
[01:45:38.561 --> 01:45:40.783]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[01:45:40.783 --> 01:45:43.244]  You silenced those voices.
[01:45:43.244 --> 01:45:47.007]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:53.431]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[01:45:58.968 --> 01:46:01.989]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[01:46:01.989 --> 01:46:06.770]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:11.872]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[01:46:11.872 --> 01:46:18.454]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[01:46:18.454 --> 01:46:23.015]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:46:23.015 --> 01:46:26.176]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[01:46:26.616 --> 01:46:28.257]  You want to go research.
[01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:34.361]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[01:46:34.361 --> 01:46:35.742]  But they're selling out quick.
[01:46:35.742 --> 01:46:38.424]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[01:46:38.424 --> 01:46:41.646]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[01:46:41.646 --> 01:46:44.008]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[01:46:44.008 --> 01:46:45.088]  It's about to sell out.
[01:46:45.088 --> 01:46:52.814]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:46:52.814 --> 01:46:53.854]  Thank you for your support.
[01:47:00.799 --> 01:47:12.486]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:12.486 --> 01:47:18.310]  John the Revelator!
[01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:23.894]  What do you mean, an elevator?
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:38.562]  We're taking a lot of amazing phone calls.
[01:47:38.562 --> 01:47:40.602]  I'm going to jam-pack the next hour with the news.
[01:47:40.602 --> 01:47:43.963]  Pray for us, we're going to the border on Wednesday morning.
[01:47:43.963 --> 01:47:47.944]  We'll have live coverage obviously there throughout the broadcast.
[01:47:47.944 --> 01:47:54.446]  Owen Troyer's show as well, and Harrison Smith, American Journal.
[01:47:54.446 --> 01:47:55.586]  We're taking your calls right now.
[01:47:56.827 --> 01:48:00.308]  Please remember, we can't finance this operation without you.
[01:48:00.308 --> 01:48:02.548]  We're financed, we're put in the field, we're backed by you.
[01:48:02.548 --> 01:48:23.292]  And when you make the simple decision to share the articles and videos, you make the simple decision to go to InfoWarshaw.com and get a book, get a film, get a water filtration system, highest rated, lowest price you're going to find, high quality storable food, when you get the supplements, when you get the X3 back in stock, when you get the TurboForce back in stock, when you get the real red pills selling out, still 40% off,
[01:48:25.171 --> 01:48:28.292]  You don't just get great products, you underwrite the resistance.
[01:48:28.292 --> 01:48:31.632]  Everybody needs an Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[01:48:31.632 --> 01:48:35.613]  Highest rated, at the price, leading competitor.
[01:48:35.613 --> 01:48:38.914]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:48:38.914 --> 01:48:41.494]  What's going on in the world, ladies and gentlemen?

[01:48:43.994 --> 01:48:49.596]  InfowarStore.com in stock, ready to ship right now.
[01:48:49.596 --> 01:48:51.776]  And finally, X3 back in stock.
[01:48:53.007 --> 01:48:57.030]  You want to experience Trinidad for yourself in the missing link.
[01:48:57.030 --> 01:49:05.096]  But look, it just gets down to prayer and then action and then realizing that it's not about going bowling and not about playing pool, which I like both.
[01:49:05.096 --> 01:49:06.417]  It's not about going and seeing movies.
[01:49:06.417 --> 01:49:08.958]  It's not about having fun.
[01:49:08.958 --> 01:49:09.699]  That's all great.
[01:49:09.699 --> 01:49:10.900]  We've already done that.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.921]  And now we're losing everything.
[01:49:12.921 --> 01:49:19.025]  It doesn't mean you don't get some R&R, but your focus has got to be civilization and crisis.
[01:49:19.025 --> 01:49:22.348]  And it's going to become very clear to everybody that we were never in Kansas.
[01:49:23.410 --> 01:49:26.431]  And that we've been in a tyranny for a very, very long time.
[01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:29.151]  It's not like, Dorothy, hey, we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
[01:49:29.151 --> 01:49:30.912]  We've never been in Kansas.
[01:49:30.912 --> 01:49:32.852]  And people ask, why is evil doing this?
[01:49:32.852 --> 01:49:33.872]  Well, because it's evil.
[01:49:33.872 --> 01:49:35.633]  It wants full control.
[01:49:35.633 --> 01:49:41.694]  America's far from perfect, but we were the least tyrannized country during the COVID.
[01:49:41.694 --> 01:49:43.095]  It's the same for everywhere else.
[01:49:43.095 --> 01:49:45.715]  They don't want us as an example of the world.
[01:49:45.715 --> 01:49:47.156]  They take us down.
[01:49:47.156 --> 01:49:48.816]  They believe they rule the world.
[01:49:48.816 --> 01:49:50.716]  That's why there's such cutthroats.
[01:49:50.716 --> 01:49:52.597]  It's why they're attacking culture, society.
[01:49:53.632 --> 01:49:54.432]  And civilization.
[01:49:54.432 --> 01:49:56.713]  It's Cloward and Pivot on steroids.
[01:49:56.713 --> 01:49:58.214]  We don't know what Cloward and Pivot is.
[01:49:58.214 --> 01:50:00.674]  Look it up.
[01:50:00.674 --> 01:50:15.859]  Husband and wife, Democrat professors, in the 60s and 70s, developed a plan to bring third world populations here to have a huge welfare state, to bankrupt the country, and make the old system fall, and then bring in tyranny on top of it.
[01:50:15.859 --> 01:50:17.200]  Next hour, here's some examples.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.962]  California defaults on $18.6 billion in debt, saddling employers with the expense.
[01:50:24.957 --> 01:50:34.301]  But don't worry, the California government now wants $569 billion for black people and reparations.
[01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:40.383]  So the state doesn't have $18 billion, but they're going to get $500 billion free money out.
[01:50:40.383 --> 01:50:41.664]  Who believes that?
[01:50:41.664 --> 01:50:45.585]  It's just to piss people off when they believe they're going to get it and don't give it to them.
[01:50:45.585 --> 01:50:50.147]  Like Biden, oh I'm going to give you free tuition, I'm going to forgive your student debt, oh I got elected, sorry!
[01:50:50.147 --> 01:50:52.128]  Not going to do it.
[01:50:53.083 --> 01:50:57.907]  First, he even signed the order to do it and then said, oh, I'm not doing it.
[01:50:57.907 --> 01:50:58.627]  Oh, my God.
[01:50:58.627 --> 01:51:00.929]  And his followers, they just clamor more.
[01:51:00.929 --> 01:51:02.270]  Well, what do we do to get the free thing?
[01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:06.073]  We'll just do more of what I say.
[01:51:06.073 --> 01:51:11.777]  It's like in business when somebody screws you over once, twice, three times, it's your fault if you believe it anymore.
[01:51:11.777 --> 01:51:12.958]  They're going to screw you.
[01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:14.059]  It's what they do.
[01:51:14.059 --> 01:51:15.200]  You're not getting a free lunch.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.782]  There isn't the resources.
[01:51:17.782 --> 01:51:18.503]  Come on, folks.
[01:51:18.503 --> 01:51:19.363]  You're not that stupid.
[01:51:19.363 --> 01:51:20.444]  I know you're smart.
[01:51:20.444 --> 01:51:22.105]  David in Atlanta, you're on the air on the border.
[01:51:22.105 --> 01:51:22.305]  Go ahead.
[01:51:24.369 --> 01:51:25.809]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[01:51:25.809 --> 01:51:44.295]  Uh, I got to disagree with that last caller because he said there's no such thing as a white supremacist Hispanic, but I could tell him in my experience, well, in California, in the penal system, when it comes down to a race war inside the jail, the whites and the Hispanics would group up together to attack the blacks.
[01:51:44.295 --> 01:51:45.835]  And that's just prison politics.
[01:51:45.835 --> 01:51:50.957]  Now, also with that being said, um, a lot of these, um,
[01:51:52.102 --> 01:52:02.429]  Gangs like these Nazi lowriders and the Banditos, like, you know, a lot of those Hispanic gangs do have a lot of that Hitler iconography stuff they believe in.
[01:52:02.429 --> 01:52:17.319]  So he had mentioned the term La Raza, which translates the race, but it actually means that you need to go find the most mestizo Hispanic and whiten the race up by marrying them and interbreeding with them.
[01:52:17.319 --> 01:52:19.681]  So I just disagree when he said there's no such thing as a
[01:52:20.618 --> 01:52:30.406]  A bag on white supremacist Hispanic when we know Richard Nixon created the term Hispanic and in the California context most Hispanics don't call themselves that.
[01:52:30.406 --> 01:52:37.151]  They either call themselves Chicanos in the prison system or or like most of their paperwork would just say white on it.
[01:52:37.151 --> 01:52:45.158]  Now now I'm not saying that this guy who did the thing in Texas is necessarily a white supremacist but I'm just saying that is a fact.
[01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:47.652]  I know some of what you're saying.
[01:52:47.652 --> 01:52:48.492]  I've not been in prison.
[01:52:48.492 --> 01:52:55.719]  I don't know all the details of that, but all I know is they won't release the transshooters info a month and a half later, but they're without any evidence saying this.
[01:52:55.719 --> 01:52:58.662]  The whole thing smells to me.
[01:52:58.662 --> 01:52:59.423]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:00.143]  It smells.
[01:53:00.143 --> 01:53:05.969]  And also I agree with the theory that these cartels also, they are kind of
[01:53:06.383 --> 01:53:09.706]  Yeah, so you know, that just goes back to the Second Amendment.
[01:53:09.706 --> 01:53:10.247]  You know why?
[01:53:10.247 --> 01:53:11.548]  It's good to have it.
[01:53:11.548 --> 01:53:12.990]  You know, hopefully we keep it, but...
[01:53:30.433 --> 01:53:33.875]  Yeah, you know, a lot of these guys come, you know, they will do murders.
[01:53:33.875 --> 01:53:35.276]  You know, you hear about it in prison.
[01:53:35.276 --> 01:53:40.378]  These guys come through five, six murders and run back across the border, and it's kind of scary.
[01:53:40.378 --> 01:53:44.920]  We have a failed state just south of us, and the Globals are trying to make America a failed state.
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:45.741]  Amazing points.
[01:53:45.741 --> 01:53:47.902]  Thank you, David, for filling us in on that.
[01:53:47.902 --> 01:53:49.823]  Mankind and California, you're on the air.
[01:53:49.823 --> 01:53:53.085]  Go ahead.
[01:53:53.085 --> 01:53:59.448]  Yes, let me just go ahead and co-sign for what that caller just said about as far as for the Hispanic gangs in California.
[01:53:59.983 --> 01:54:05.146]  Man, I was born and raised in that, and that's absolutely true.
[01:54:05.146 --> 01:54:12.030]  They actually use the Hispanic gangs to actually go against the blacks.
[01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:18.034]  California, in general, just has a total prison mentality for the whole state.
[01:54:18.034 --> 01:54:20.675]  Everybody that lives here knows that.
[01:54:20.675 --> 01:54:26.138]  But again, there's a lot of Americans that still live here in California that are battling back against that.
[01:54:27.538 --> 01:54:37.103]  My main point for bringing that up was just the fact that everybody is on notice right now, especially with the graphic footage that you showed.
[01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:43.446]  Unfortunately, you had to show that, but that should be a wake-up call for everybody right now nationwide.
[01:54:43.446 --> 01:54:54.951]  I'm calling for people to, when you go out on your daily routine, whether it's to the grocery store, to the gas station, to the movies, anywhere, any of these places that you go to on a regular basis,
[01:54:55.504 --> 01:54:57.144]  You be the info.
[01:54:57.144 --> 01:55:14.148]  Keep your eyes and ears open for the changes that you're seeing in your community and keep an eye on them so you and your loved ones and the people close to you in your community are not taken by surprise like they were in this last shooting and last killing.
[01:55:14.148 --> 01:55:17.109]  Be aware of everything that's going on in your community.
[01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:21.850]  When you start seeing people at the grocery store that you haven't really seen there before,
[01:55:23.003 --> 01:55:24.285]  Or any of these places.
[01:55:24.285 --> 01:55:30.338]  Protect yourself and protect each other because we're protecting the innocents.
[01:55:30.338 --> 01:55:30.899]  Absolutely.
[01:55:30.899 --> 01:55:33.344]  And still statistically, crime went down.
[01:55:34.605 --> 01:55:35.306]  Hit its peak in 92.
[01:55:35.306 --> 01:55:38.688]  It's been going down since 92, but mass shootings are up.
[01:55:38.688 --> 01:55:41.650]  Still, it's nothing compared to fentanyl.
[01:55:41.650 --> 01:55:45.673]  279% increase since 2016, killing over 100,000 a year.
[01:55:45.673 --> 01:55:47.634]  Mass shootings are killing a couple hundred a year.
[01:55:47.634 --> 01:55:50.516]  But still, the image of the cold-bloodedness is terrible.
[01:55:50.516 --> 01:55:51.657]  And again, it creates fear.
[01:55:51.657 --> 01:55:52.818]  It creates destabilization.
[01:55:52.818 --> 01:55:55.000]  And if your little girl got her head blown off,
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.181]  You're not a statistic, you're a real person.
[01:55:57.181 --> 01:56:02.604]  I just cannot imagine how a full-grown man gets out of a car and shoots a five-year-old girl in the head.
[01:56:02.604 --> 01:56:04.685]  I mean, just what the hell is going on here?
[01:56:04.685 --> 01:56:06.846]  But I guess we abort all the babies anyways.
[01:56:06.846 --> 01:56:09.448]  We've got a lot of evil going on here.
[01:56:09.448 --> 01:56:10.408]  Exactly.
[01:56:10.408 --> 01:56:18.152]  And my main point, I fly back and forth from, I'll just say, a lot of the southwestern states here in America.
[01:56:18.152 --> 01:56:24.436]  And every single time that I go to the airport, I document footage of all of the illegals
[01:56:25.106 --> 01:56:27.668]  Being orchestrated to come here.
[01:56:27.668 --> 01:56:29.129]  They all have a leader.
[01:56:29.129 --> 01:56:30.930]  I have, I have filmed this.
[01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:35.513]  I'm actually going to be uploading it to my website for this past trip that I took.
[01:56:35.513 --> 01:56:39.656]  Um, where I'm, I've documented, you know, how they used to have the manila folders.
[01:56:39.656 --> 01:56:45.140]  Now they have changed to, um, the, they have plastic bags and I'm telling everybody what to look for.
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:48.382]  When you go to the airport, they now have plastic bags.
[01:56:48.382 --> 01:56:52.605]  There'll be clear plastic bags and they have itinerary in them.
[01:56:53.263 --> 01:56:58.890]  Um, they all have the same, um, uh, contents within the packages.
[01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:06.820]  And, uh, if you can film these people doing these things, there's always one person who is orchestrating and leading these people.
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.864]  And in many cases, they're unattended small children.
[01:57:09.864 --> 01:57:10.966]  God knows where they're going.
[01:57:11.929 --> 01:57:13.110]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:13.811]  Unattended.
[01:57:13.811 --> 01:57:18.636]  And so, if you can document this, like I said, keep your head on a swivel no matter where you go.
[01:57:18.636 --> 01:57:19.717]  Document everything.
[01:57:19.717 --> 01:57:24.042]  Like I said, I'm going to be uploading this to my website so that people can... Okay, what's your website?
[01:57:24.042 --> 01:57:26.284]  What's your website, Mankind?
[01:57:26.284 --> 01:57:28.526]  Uh, it's actually ProfitC.net.
[01:57:28.526 --> 01:57:34.032]  So that's Profit, P-R-O-P-H-E, T as in Tango, C as in Charlie, dot net.
[01:57:35.526 --> 01:57:36.207]  We'll check it out.
[01:57:36.207 --> 01:57:37.247]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:37.247 --> 01:57:38.008]  We'll look it up.
[01:57:38.008 --> 01:57:38.608]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:38.608 --> 01:57:40.830]  All right, hour number three.
[01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:42.671]  More calls, a ton of news.
[01:57:42.671 --> 01:57:43.191]  Straight ahead.
[01:57:43.191 --> 01:57:44.632]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[01:57:44.632 --> 01:57:49.276]  You are Paul Revere.
[01:57:49.276 --> 01:57:55.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.542]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:57:58.542 --> 01:58:04.887]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[01:58:05.527 --> 01:58:08.068]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:58:08.068 --> 01:58:20.974]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[01:58:21.634 --> 01:58:31.561]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[01:58:31.561 --> 01:58:33.942]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:58:33.942 --> 01:58:39.626]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:58:39.626 --> 01:58:42.307]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:42.307 --> 01:58:45.650]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:46.950]  X3, back in stock.
[01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:48.011]  Take action now.

[01:58:49.452 --> 01:58:55.457]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:58:55.457 --> 01:58:58.119]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:58:58.119 --> 01:59:00.301]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:59:00.301 --> 01:59:02.883]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:59:02.883 --> 01:59:06.106]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:59:06.106 --> 01:59:07.868]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[01:59:07.868 --> 01:59:14.513]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:59:14.513 --> 01:59:17.296]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:20.361]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:59:20.361 --> 01:59:25.005]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:59:25.005 --> 01:59:28.727]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:59:28.727 --> 01:59:31.849]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[01:59:31.849 --> 01:59:34.411]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:59:34.411 --> 01:59:35.772]  We're barely hanging on.

[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:51.162]  Let's watch.
[02:00:17.091 --> 02:00:21.174]  Yeah Alex, I'm probably calling like six years too late here.
[02:00:21.174 --> 02:00:22.675]  I wish I could have talked to you in 2017.
[02:00:22.675 --> 02:00:26.618]  I work for Civilian Air Cargo and I just want to let you know that
[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:46.862]  Uh, back in Africa, the same thing was going on, and they were, we were witness to it, and we were shipping everybody up to Africa.
[02:00:46.862 --> 02:00:56.044]  So now we got the same thing happening, uh, here in the United States, and you just gotta look out, like, what's happening in Europe, and in the UK, and think, this is gonna happen to us.
[02:00:56.044 --> 02:01:04.246]  Like, you can't sit around, and just, like you say, play your sports, or your video games, and whatever, and ignore it, because we're gonna be just like them, but with guns.
[02:01:04.246 --> 02:01:06.487]  So, it's gonna be, like, hell on Earth,
[02:01:07.282 --> 02:01:11.645]  And this fifth generation warfare is just going to really overrun us.
[02:01:11.645 --> 02:01:17.969]  And I think that people really need to put their head in a swivel and start speaking up, especially, you know, coming from me.
[02:01:17.969 --> 02:01:25.755]  I'm a bit nervous talking about this, but if you're in civilian air cargo and you're flying around the world and you notice things that are wrong, you need to start speaking up.
[02:01:25.755 --> 02:01:33.380]  I'm sick and tired of working with these people that have destroyed our country in the name of thinking they're working with some special agency because they're getting paid a lot of money.
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:35.301]  If you're a pilot or aircraft mechanic,
[02:01:35.501 --> 02:01:36.461]  You're a loadmaster.
[02:01:36.461 --> 02:01:38.602]  You're whatever helping these companies.
[02:01:38.602 --> 02:01:42.943]  You need to do something and say something and blow the whistle because I've been doing that.
[02:01:42.943 --> 02:01:44.084]  I've been fighting in the inside.
[02:01:44.084 --> 02:01:47.225]  I actually had to sneak outside right now to get you this phone call.
[02:01:47.225 --> 02:01:49.425]  And I'm actually hiding in a parking lot.
[02:01:49.425 --> 02:01:57.968]  But in order for people to understand that like what's happening in the civilian side, working with the DOD, is that the pieces are coming in place.
[02:01:58.610 --> 02:02:11.748]  And it's not going to be stopped, and I'm so happy that Michael Yeo and you have him on the show to talk about this, because the things that are going on secretly, you know, this transparency, air quotes there, it is unbelievable.
[02:02:11.748 --> 02:02:13.290]  And the chess pieces are already in place.
[02:02:13.670 --> 02:02:29.160]  And the DoD is working with the UNSF, who's in Africa, in Central Bengui, is working with the same NGOs that ship the same dangerous people into Europe, the same dangerous people shipping from Central Africa, you know, all around the world, in Central America and South America, to our border.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:34.083]  And it's so scary to, like, be around people that are so ignorant to this.
[02:02:34.083 --> 02:02:39.146]  And, you know, I'm just happy that I was able to call in and make this statement, Alex.
[02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:41.131]  I've been looking to call for you for years.
[02:02:41.131 --> 02:02:50.075]  Well, sir, what you're saying is important because the AI, the surveillance, all of it, if the majority of us just don't comply, they can't enforce it on us, they can't punish us.
[02:02:50.075 --> 02:02:53.056]  But when we comply and submit and are scared, they win.
[02:02:53.056 --> 02:02:54.917]  The majority of people in the government are not bad.
[02:02:54.917 --> 02:02:55.678]  They're just like us.
[02:02:55.678 --> 02:02:56.478]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:02:56.478 --> 02:02:57.098]  They're pissed.
[02:02:57.098 --> 02:03:00.000]  In fact, most of them are more awake because they see the evil going on.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.020]  The government's not our enemy.
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:02.901]  It's the criminals that have hijacked it.
[02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:04.702]  The rest of us have to realize this is not our government.
[02:03:04.702 --> 02:03:06.663]  This is an occupational, globalist government.
[02:03:07.203 --> 02:03:13.464]  Shutting the country down, whether we're in the private sector, the public sector, it doesn't matter whether you're a pastor or you shine shoes.
[02:03:13.464 --> 02:03:19.165]  You've all got your voice, you can all do the right thing, and it's really a battle of good versus evil.
[02:03:19.165 --> 02:03:29.907]  Yeah, and I just, you know, on the other side of things, besides the border, you know, what's going on with China and the Pacific side, there's a big operation that's happening right now as we speak.
[02:03:29.907 --> 02:03:33.108]  I really can't get too much into it without revealing myself and probably getting a phone call.
[02:03:33.635 --> 02:03:44.241]  But, uh, we're, you know, really prepping with massive amounts of armament out of, uh, Alaska and moving it, you know, Washington, California... Now that's the next thing I was going to cover in the articles on InfoWars.
[02:03:44.241 --> 02:03:45.882]  NATO now preparing to work with the U.S.
[02:03:45.882 --> 02:03:46.623]  with war with China.
[02:03:47.694 --> 02:03:56.942]  Yeah, I think they're staging either to say, like, hey, we're here now, and I don't know who's on the inside working against Biden to push China, but it's definitely happening.
[02:03:56.942 --> 02:03:59.424]  The Philippines is cracking big time.
[02:03:59.424 --> 02:04:13.537]  There's some big contracts going out to civilian air cargo that many people that I've worked with on the inside, I've given the info to, just to track those things and just be aware that that is actually the other thing on the other side of the world that's happening besides us being invaded by 5th Generation Warfare.
[02:04:14.375 --> 02:04:15.936]  All hell's broken loose.
[02:04:15.936 --> 02:04:20.959]  The New World Order is here, welcome to the Great Reset, and building back better on our ashes.
[02:04:20.959 --> 02:04:23.060]  Anything else, John?
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:29.603]  I think everybody just needs to continue to be aware, support the InfoWar, take all your InfoWar supplements.
[02:04:29.603 --> 02:04:30.624]  I've been doing it for years.
[02:04:30.624 --> 02:04:35.006]  I hand it out like I'm a salesman, and just keep on going.
[02:04:35.006 --> 02:04:36.127]  You are a salesman of liberty.
[02:04:36.127 --> 02:04:37.048]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[02:04:37.048 --> 02:04:38.508]  Thank you, John.
[02:04:38.508 --> 02:04:41.130]  I said I'd get into AI earlier, and I'm mad at the crew, but I forgot.
[02:04:41.130 --> 02:04:41.810]  They forgot to tell me.
[02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:51.333]  It gives me a headache because it's just so complex, but I'm going to tell you what's really going on with AI when we, at the bottom of the hour.
[02:04:51.333 --> 02:04:52.373]  Guys, remind me.
[02:04:52.373 --> 02:04:53.154]  I'm going to do it then.
[02:04:53.154 --> 02:04:54.234]  Bottom of the hour.
[02:04:54.234 --> 02:04:54.735]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:54.735 --> 02:04:55.095]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.377 --> 02:05:01.958]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:05:01.958 --> 02:05:04.220]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:06.201]  It will change your life.
[02:05:06.201 --> 02:05:14.965]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:05:14.965 --> 02:05:20.308]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:05:20.308 --> 02:05:21.769]  Most iodine in the environment
[02:05:22.469 --> 02:05:26.013]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:05:26.013 --> 02:05:30.477]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:05:30.477 --> 02:05:37.564]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:05:37.564 --> 02:05:43.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:05:44.130 --> 02:05:46.512]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:05:46.512 --> 02:05:48.753]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:05:48.753 --> 02:05:50.554]  You and your family need it.
[02:05:50.554 --> 02:05:52.295]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:05:52.295 --> 02:05:56.518]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[02:05:56.518 --> 02:06:04.604]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:06:04.604 --> 02:06:09.527]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:11.078 --> 02:06:18.600]  All right, I'm going to jam-pack this hour with a ton of critical information on AI, on the economy, on the war in Ukraine, and more.
[02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:20.820]  Plus, big Tucker Carlson news.
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:25.481]  Well, if you tuned in a few weeks ago, you already know all this, but now it's mainstream news, so I can talk about it.
[02:06:25.481 --> 02:06:27.462]  Very important to the info war.
[02:06:27.462 --> 02:06:29.602]  I'm going to play a few clips here.
[02:06:29.602 --> 02:06:33.223]  Here's House Democrat Chair Pete Aguilar claims Democrats want order.
[02:06:34.451 --> 02:06:38.315]  What do you think of the President's approach to what is happening at the border?
[02:06:58.442 --> 02:07:00.904]  Well, House Democrats want order at the border.
[02:07:00.904 --> 02:07:04.407]  We want asylees treated with dignity and respect.
[02:07:07.256 --> 02:07:07.396]  Yes.
[02:07:32.333 --> 02:07:38.400]  Right, Congressman, I totally get this, but we've been saying this for 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 years.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.204]  There is a massive crisis at the southern border right now.
[02:07:42.204 --> 02:07:46.910]  I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but it's only getting worse.
[02:07:47.290 --> 02:07:50.112]  Now, Border Patrol officers have been arriving throughout the day.
[02:07:50.112 --> 02:07:51.954]  We were here all of yesterday.
[02:07:51.954 --> 02:07:52.875]  They do what they can.
[02:07:52.875 --> 02:07:58.960]  They've told us that their facilities are at capacity, both Border Patrol stations and the processing centers.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:03.924]  And that's why these migrants have to remain here, waiting for the Border Patrol agents to finally come in.
[02:08:03.924 --> 02:08:05.505]  And they do come throughout the day.
[02:08:05.505 --> 02:08:06.106]  They have vans.
[02:08:06.226 --> 02:08:11.428]  They load up the women and children, some of the families, but some of these men say they've been here for days.
[02:08:11.428 --> 02:08:16.529]  And you can actually hear some of them that will yell, asking us to help them charge their phones.
[02:08:16.529 --> 02:08:18.290]  Some of them need water.
[02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:19.110]  Some of them want food.
[02:08:19.110 --> 02:08:24.172]  And throughout the day, we also have some organizations that bring some of that water, some of the food.
[02:08:24.172 --> 02:08:28.913]  Border Patrol has also provided food and water during the time we've been here, but they have been overwhelmed.
[02:08:29.233 --> 02:08:32.075]  And right now, you see about two to three hundred.
[02:08:32.075 --> 02:08:36.238]  They keep coming throughout the day as border patrol will take some of them to get processed.
[02:08:36.238 --> 02:08:37.859]  And this is just one of the camps.
[02:08:37.859 --> 02:08:41.461]  There's another camp less than a mile away in that direction.
[02:08:41.461 --> 02:08:45.404]  And of course, we've seen this surge all across the Mexico-U.S.
[02:08:45.404 --> 02:08:45.644]  border.
[02:08:48.063 --> 02:08:56.209]  The pathways and the plans that are in place obviously for majority Venezuelan migrants that was expanded to Haitian, Cuban and Nicaraguan migrants.
[02:08:56.209 --> 02:08:59.512]  Why isn't that policy being enforced right now?
[02:08:59.512 --> 02:09:04.836]  Many of the migrants I'm meeting along the streets of Brownsville are swimming in between the ports of entry.
[02:09:04.836 --> 02:09:07.839]  As you have mentioned, if that happens they're supposed to be returned.
[02:09:07.839 --> 02:09:10.841]  They're not being returned and they're single adults without family here.
[02:09:10.841 --> 02:09:11.622]  Why is that happening?
[02:09:12.322 --> 02:09:29.454]  So, I think you are actually mistaken because the parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans that we first announced and implemented on January 5th is underway and continues to be underway.
[02:09:29.454 --> 02:09:30.815]  And we continue, if I may...
[02:09:31.921 --> 02:09:33.382]  If I may, it does.
[02:09:33.382 --> 02:09:44.632]  And if I may, we continue to parole individuals of those four nationalities when they qualify under the program that we established and announced.
[02:09:44.632 --> 02:09:53.899]  And that requires a sponsor here in the United States to ensure that those individuals have financial stability and they are able to arrive in a safe and orderly way.
[02:09:53.899 --> 02:09:55.901]  That is indeed underway.
[02:09:55.901 --> 02:09:56.862]  And we continue
[02:09:57.182 --> 02:09:57.622]  Legalize them!
[02:10:18.864 --> 02:10:29.356]  Those removals will continue and that is why the message is so important that people, vulnerable people, are receiving false information.
[02:10:29.356 --> 02:10:35.183]  They are being lied to that if they come and arrive at our border that they can stay in the United States.
[02:10:35.183 --> 02:10:37.145]  That is not what the law provides.
[02:10:37.145 --> 02:10:39.248]  That is not the consequence that we will deliver.
[02:10:40.891 --> 02:10:42.251]  They're being lied to.
[02:10:42.251 --> 02:10:46.773]  So they say, if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[02:10:46.773 --> 02:10:48.534]  The UN gives them the credit cards.
[02:10:48.534 --> 02:10:49.754]  The media tells them, come.
[02:10:49.754 --> 02:10:50.254]  They get here.
[02:10:50.254 --> 02:10:51.635]  They let most of them in.
[02:10:51.635 --> 02:10:55.836]  They send some back so the cartels can make more money and launder it to the Democratic Party.
[02:10:55.836 --> 02:10:56.876]  That's what's happening.
[02:10:56.876 --> 02:10:58.937]  No debate about it.
[02:10:58.937 --> 02:11:01.918]  And then Mayorkas gets up and acts like, oh, don't come here.
[02:11:01.918 --> 02:11:02.738]  You're being lied to.
[02:11:02.738 --> 02:11:04.039]  You won't be let in.
[02:11:04.039 --> 02:11:04.299]  What?
[02:11:06.175 --> 02:11:14.760]  And the Democrat media complains, well they're having to swim, they don't have food, they're sitting around, they can't charge their phones, you gave them.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:16.782]  The whole country's collapsing!
[02:11:16.782 --> 02:11:19.523]  The Democrats act like there's just endless money.
[02:11:19.523 --> 02:11:23.526]  California just defaulted on $18 billion debt.
[02:11:23.526 --> 02:11:25.867]  But they said they're going to give $500 billion to black people.
[02:11:25.867 --> 02:11:28.769]  Do you believe that?
[02:11:28.769 --> 02:11:33.652]  If they gave $500 billion to black people or anybody else, it would just cause massive inflation.
[02:11:33.652 --> 02:11:34.773]  There's not enough goods!
[02:11:36.693 --> 02:11:45.024]  Real wealth is farms, and factories, and ranches, and businesses, and happy people.
[02:11:45.024 --> 02:11:49.470]  Oh, Venezuela, it took a billion dollars to buy a ham sandwich.
[02:11:53.513 --> 02:11:57.734]  Or Zimbabwe, or any of these places, or the Weimar Republic, Germany.
[02:11:57.734 --> 02:11:59.375]  This is all being done by design.
[02:11:59.375 --> 02:12:00.755]  They know exactly how to do it.
[02:12:00.755 --> 02:12:08.797]  The Federal Reserve gave out all this free money to themselves and their buddies, and then now cut the money off to everybody else, and then wonders why the economy's tanking.
[02:12:08.797 --> 02:12:10.578]  It's a plan.
[02:12:10.578 --> 02:12:13.039]  But you just heard Mayorkas.
[02:12:13.039 --> 02:12:15.759]  Back it up like 30 seconds towards the end there.
[02:12:15.759 --> 02:12:16.360]  Back it up.
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:16.960]  Take your time.
[02:12:17.648 --> 02:12:19.069]  No, it takes time to find it.
[02:12:19.069 --> 02:12:22.331]  Where he says, you're being given false information.
[02:12:22.331 --> 02:12:24.292]  Vulnerable people, don't come here.
[02:12:24.292 --> 02:12:31.097]  Oh, you told, oh, I love how climate change is the reason their farms and ranches don't work.
[02:12:31.097 --> 02:12:35.900]  And they, no, for two plus years in Latin America and Africa, they shut everything down.
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:37.801]  No business, no jobs, no nothing.
[02:12:37.801 --> 02:12:39.802]  They're starving to death.
[02:12:39.802 --> 02:12:42.704]  That was the lockdown, not the virus.
[02:12:42.704 --> 02:12:43.865]  That's all admitted now.
[02:12:43.865 --> 02:12:44.665]  The mask didn't work.
[02:12:44.665 --> 02:12:45.306]  It was all a lie.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:51.844]  And then that floods the third world into Europe, and into the United States, and Canada, and Australia, and New Zealand.
[02:12:51.844 --> 02:12:56.068]  The globalists organize it, give them debit cards to come here, and they say, oh, climate change.
[02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:58.530]  Like, climate change is why we got COVID.
[02:12:58.530 --> 02:13:00.171]  No, you made it in a lab.
[02:13:00.171 --> 02:13:05.015]  Now Bill Gates is like, climate change is going to cause a new deadly virus to come out of the jungle and kill you.
[02:13:05.015 --> 02:13:08.358]  It's coming, Marburg, or something else.
[02:13:08.358 --> 02:13:13.882]  Oh, the world will be over in 2030, they're saying, because they're going to end it as we know it.
[02:13:13.882 --> 02:13:15.784]  So here's my orchestra, and we'll go right into the clip.
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:24.842]  If I may, it does.
[02:13:24.842 --> 02:13:36.105]  And if I may, we continue to parole individuals of those four nationalities when they qualify under the program that we established and announced.
[02:13:36.105 --> 02:13:45.047]  And that requires a sponsor here in the United States to ensure that those individuals have financial stability and they are able to arrive in a safe and orderly way.
[02:13:45.367 --> 02:13:53.775]  That is indeed underway, and we continue to expel Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.
[02:13:53.775 --> 02:14:00.220]  The number of Venezuelans that we've been able to expel has actually diminished over the past two weeks.
[02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:02.542]  The cause of that is a very complicated one.
[02:14:02.542 --> 02:14:09.829]  We've sat down with the Mexican government and those expulsions, and of course, in a post-Title 42 environment,
[02:14:10.329 --> 02:14:12.891]  Those removals will continue.
[02:14:12.891 --> 02:14:15.672]  And that is why the message is so important.
[02:14:15.672 --> 02:14:20.835]  That people, vulnerable people, are receiving false information.
[02:14:20.835 --> 02:14:22.436]  They are being lied to.
[02:14:22.436 --> 02:14:26.658]  That if they come and arrive at our border, that they can stay in the United States.
[02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:28.600]  That is not what the law provides.
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:30.701]  That is not the consequence that we will deliver.
[02:14:31.221 --> 02:14:39.329]  First of all, the idea that Joe Biden said, come, because I heard the other day that they're coming because they know I'm a nice guy.
[02:14:39.329 --> 02:14:43.453]  Sure, that there is, we immediately served to the border.
[02:14:43.453 --> 02:14:45.355]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[02:14:45.355 --> 02:14:46.336]  They deserve to be heard.
[02:14:46.336 --> 02:14:47.517]  That's who we are.
[02:14:47.517 --> 02:14:51.881]  We're a nation that says, if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[02:14:51.881 --> 02:14:53.923]  They're seeking asylum.
[02:14:53.923 --> 02:14:54.804]  First time ever.
[02:14:54.824 --> 02:14:57.726]  So, a deceptive group is telling them, come here, and then they come here,
[02:15:20.444 --> 02:15:30.868]  And they let 90% in, but send 10% back for the cartels to kill and rape and rob and charge again, so the Democrat lawyers get to launder that money in cash.
[02:15:30.868 --> 02:15:37.290]  I mean, total abuse at every level, a failed border, in your face, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:38.470]  What a powerful clip.
[02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:46.773]  So we should have one of the crews just take what Mayorkas just said, the short part about, don't listen to people saying, come here, they're liars, and then just cut right to Joe Biden.
[02:15:48.909 --> 02:15:49.729]  Alex, how are you doing?
[02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:58.752]  I know it's not the most pleasant of times down in Texas.
[02:15:58.752 --> 02:16:01.833]  I hope you guys are all doing okay, though.
[02:16:17.737 --> 02:16:31.773]  It's disgusting, and I posted a video a couple days ago from you guys that CNN was actually covering some of the news for the first time in years, and I posted it on TikTok.
[02:16:32.578 --> 02:16:33.878]  I have no followers.
[02:16:33.878 --> 02:16:37.099]  I ended up having like 75,000 people view it.
[02:16:37.099 --> 02:16:39.040]  A thousand comments, a bunch of likes.
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:40.060]  People are going nuts.
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:42.181]  They're not happy with what's going on.
[02:16:42.181 --> 02:16:43.001]  Oh no, people are waking up.
[02:16:43.001 --> 02:16:45.802]  That's the good news is the globalists have jumped the shark.
[02:16:45.802 --> 02:16:46.882]  So what's the name of your TikTok?
[02:16:46.882 --> 02:16:47.882]  What's the name of the video?
[02:16:47.882 --> 02:16:48.602]  We'll pull it up.
[02:16:48.602 --> 02:16:49.603]  What's the name?
[02:16:49.603 --> 02:16:55.344]  So if you go to it, it's underscore I play music underscore.
[02:16:55.344 --> 02:16:57.545]  I play music underscore where?
[02:16:57.545 --> 02:16:58.665]  I play music then underscore?
[02:16:59.435 --> 02:17:05.161]  On TikTok, there's an underscore before I play music, and then after I play music.
[02:17:05.161 --> 02:17:08.624]  So underscore, I play music, underscore, and then what's the name of the video?
[02:17:08.624 --> 02:17:09.825]  And we'll be able to find it.
[02:17:09.825 --> 02:17:10.966]  Oh, it's the first one.
[02:17:10.966 --> 02:17:11.567]  It's got 74,000.
[02:17:11.567 --> 02:17:15.070]  It just says, The Southern Border's Gone.
[02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:16.572]  And it's Joe Biden's face right there.
[02:17:16.572 --> 02:17:18.634]  The Southern Border's Gone on TikTok, guys.
[02:17:18.634 --> 02:17:19.655]  Get it?
[02:17:19.655 --> 02:17:20.556]  Show!
[02:17:20.556 --> 02:17:21.196]  I mean, look at this.
[02:17:21.196 --> 02:17:22.738]  They're attacking us on all sides.
[02:17:22.738 --> 02:17:23.639]  Where do you see this going?
[02:17:24.639 --> 02:17:30.541]  Well, okay, so, you know, I had somebody tell me, like, hey, it's not just the southern border, it's up in New York.
[02:17:30.541 --> 02:17:35.723]  And when you type in New York Hotel Migrant, it's not New York City anymore.
[02:17:35.723 --> 02:17:44.445]  Mayor Adams on Friday decided he's going to dump them off in, I believe it said, Orangetown or Orangeburg and Rockland County, New York.
[02:17:44.445 --> 02:17:45.686]  I know you've been in the city before.
[02:17:45.686 --> 02:17:47.726]  I don't know if you've been in the outside areas.
[02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:48.467]  It's not too far.
[02:17:48.467 --> 02:17:50.767]  We're talking 15, 20 minutes from the city.
[02:17:50.767 --> 02:17:52.408]  But, you know, this
[02:17:53.089 --> 02:18:02.439]  This is going to be a problem where you're going to see more and more of this, unfortunately, because those areas, they're the suburbs, but they have a homeless problem over there.
[02:18:02.439 --> 02:18:07.044]  You drive up there and there's panhandling going on already from all affluent groups.
[02:18:07.044 --> 02:18:09.766]  White, black, Hispanic.
[02:18:09.766 --> 02:18:10.808]  It's terrible.
[02:18:11.843 --> 02:18:20.568]  The reason why I called in was obviously to say that, but not only that, I don't know if you saw the show Stranger Things.
[02:18:20.568 --> 02:18:20.848]  Yes.
[02:18:20.848 --> 02:18:25.831]  The final episode of... No, I only saw part of the first season.
[02:18:25.831 --> 02:18:38.159]  Okay, so if you go to the last episode, the last few moments of the last episode, you know, the kids are all together, everybody's back, and then they get this weird feeling that, oh wow, like the evil spirit or whatever is back.
[02:18:38.635 --> 02:18:41.136]  That upside-down is hell.
[02:18:41.136 --> 02:18:45.518]  That's what they're showing us on Netflix and the propaganda and it's seeping through.
[02:18:45.518 --> 02:18:59.164]  Well, in reality, the upside-down is now coming into our world where you see this garbage at the southern border where there's violence and there's all kinds of terrible actions going on.
[02:18:59.164 --> 02:19:02.505]  It's really, like, we're living in an upside-down.
[02:19:02.505 --> 02:19:04.086]  We're fully living in the upside-down.
[02:19:04.086 --> 02:19:06.327]  That's what Satanism is, is an inverted world.
[02:19:07.412 --> 02:19:12.818]  And yeah, and there's really good people, I'm sure, that are coming across that are chasing that American dream.
[02:19:12.818 --> 02:19:18.004]  Yeah, no, no, we're not against these people shut down under a UN global lockdown, starving to death.
[02:19:18.004 --> 02:19:23.150]  The point is they're being brought here to lower wages, be a slave class, and then be voters for the globalists.
[02:19:24.008 --> 02:19:24.749]  Yeah.
[02:19:24.749 --> 02:19:25.509]  Here's an example.
[02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:26.690]  I love a cool drink of water.
[02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:28.272]  I love to swim in a lake.
[02:19:28.272 --> 02:19:31.074]  But if a dam breaks, I don't want to be drowned under it.
[02:19:31.074 --> 02:19:32.035]  I love water.
[02:19:32.035 --> 02:19:35.318]  I'm not against these people from Africa, Latin America, everywhere.
[02:19:35.318 --> 02:19:35.679]  I get it.
[02:19:35.679 --> 02:19:37.801]  But they are a weapon now.
[02:19:37.801 --> 02:19:39.482]  And they're not going to be saved flooding us.
[02:19:39.482 --> 02:19:40.883]  So yeah, that's it.
[02:19:40.883 --> 02:19:42.505]  I love water, but not when you stick my head in it.
[02:19:43.584 --> 02:19:46.547]  Yeah, and you know, Alex, you're doing a great job.
[02:19:46.547 --> 02:19:52.732]  I know that it's probably impossible to get you even for like three minutes, but I've always wanted to ask you a couple questions.
[02:19:52.732 --> 02:19:54.653]  I don't know if that's something I could email.
[02:19:54.653 --> 02:19:56.054]  No, no, no.
[02:19:56.054 --> 02:19:57.175]  We can do it right now, brother.
[02:19:57.175 --> 02:19:58.957]  Go ahead and ask your questions.
[02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:03.300]  Okay, so the question, I had three questions.
[02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:07.344]  What was the point of the shots beyond testing and control?
[02:20:07.344 --> 02:20:08.365]  The second thing is,
[02:20:10.108 --> 02:20:16.039]  When, when, because we say like, oh, you know, the... We're going to miss your first question.
[02:20:16.039 --> 02:20:17.782]  You're asking about the COVID shots?
[02:20:18.757 --> 02:20:24.021]  Right, so if you could ever get that, what was the point beyond seeing what they could control?
[02:20:24.021 --> 02:20:28.764]  Because there's got to be more than that where they told everybody to get it and then they just back off.
[02:20:28.764 --> 02:20:33.448]  I always felt like there's something more than that.
[02:20:33.448 --> 02:20:34.608]  I know exactly the whole point.
[02:20:34.608 --> 02:20:35.489]  I have the answer to it.
[02:20:35.489 --> 02:20:37.751]  It'll take 10 hours, but I'll try to explain it in 5 minutes.
[02:20:37.751 --> 02:20:41.493]  Okay, point of the shots, number 2.
[02:20:41.493 --> 02:20:45.196]  Number 2 is, because we're always saying that we're winning.
[02:20:45.854 --> 02:20:48.895]  What if we're not, and how bad could it get?
[02:20:48.895 --> 02:20:52.315]  And then the third one dovetails off of that.
[02:20:52.315 --> 02:20:54.896]  What do you do?
[02:20:54.896 --> 02:21:03.977]  Like, how do you sort of stop the flood of, you know, that metaphorical flood, if you will, of it's going to get bad and you've got to brace for it?
[02:21:03.977 --> 02:21:06.118]  You know, like, what would be the plan?
[02:21:06.118 --> 02:21:07.958]  I know you have the other website.
[02:21:07.958 --> 02:21:11.819]  Would that be something you could kind of do a special on over there?
[02:21:13.154 --> 02:21:15.755]  All right, let me answer your questions, and I appreciate your call.
[02:21:15.755 --> 02:21:18.036]  Those are all excellent questions.
[02:21:18.036 --> 02:21:21.518]  In fact, they're the big questions.
[02:21:21.518 --> 02:21:27.580]  What was the point of the shots, the whole takeover?
[02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:34.624]  What if we're not winning, and what do we do if we're losing?
[02:21:34.624 --> 02:21:41.847]  And again, when I get asked a question this important, it's a little bit of like standing on the edge of a cliff, because I don't want to give you some half-assed, lazy answer.
[02:21:43.519 --> 02:21:44.319]  There's so many points.
[02:21:44.319 --> 02:21:51.142]  How do you condense it down?
[02:21:51.142 --> 02:22:00.626]  Bill Gates and Peter Daszak and Fauci and all of them had a whole bunch of C-SPAN and TED Talk events.
[02:22:00.626 --> 02:22:02.167]  We've aired a bunch of clubs here.
[02:22:02.167 --> 02:22:04.968]  Dozens of them.
[02:22:04.968 --> 02:22:07.789]  Started about three years before they released COVID in 2020, early 2020.
[02:22:07.789 --> 02:22:10.010]  They released it actually a few months before.
[02:22:11.365 --> 02:22:18.573]  And they said, we have a regulatory system that doesn't let us just push drugs and products right to the public.
[02:22:18.573 --> 02:22:26.401]  We need to blow up the old system and set the precedent to just bring whatever we want to market.
[02:22:26.401 --> 02:22:27.723]  So it's about them being able
[02:22:28.399 --> 02:22:44.248]  To release whatever they want, and then have the answer to what they've done, and take control of society, and have vaccine passports that are the basis of the World ID, the central bank digital currency, and the social credit score, and the universal basic income, and all the things that come with that.
[02:22:44.248 --> 02:22:46.230]  So, it's a whole agenda.
[02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:48.271]  It's not like one thing's most important.
[02:22:48.271 --> 02:22:53.634]  It's like a house, foundation, and then the beams, and the outside, and the rooms, and
[02:22:54.284 --> 02:23:00.409]  The electricity, and the plumbing, and the furniture, and all of it.
[02:23:00.409 --> 02:23:06.833]  And so it's about a scientific tyranny being able to do whatever they want, whenever they want, in the name of our safety.
[02:23:06.833 --> 02:23:07.734]  And it's about the U.N.
[02:23:07.734 --> 02:23:16.540]  or the World Treaty controlling our bodies through the medical system and getting rid of bodily autonomy, the ultimate form of slavery.
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:21.084]  And so the shots were about release of virus, block the therapeutics,
[02:23:22.485 --> 02:23:24.806]  Lock old people up, see how far you can get away with that.
[02:23:24.806 --> 02:23:28.286]  Corrupt the local states that did it so you can blackmail those leaders who signed on to it.
[02:23:28.286 --> 02:23:36.268]  Because they can selectively only burn them, the Cuomos, the world, and not the people that created the policy.
[02:23:36.268 --> 02:23:40.069]  Cuomos aren't that smart.
[02:23:40.069 --> 02:23:43.010]  The governor of Michigan's not that smart, Whitmer.
[02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:44.370]  That's why they're chosen, because they're stupid.
[02:23:45.546 --> 02:23:46.607]  It's about blackmail and control.
[02:23:46.607 --> 02:23:58.562]  It's about getting the legal system and the whole culture on board with modern human sacrifice, where large portions of people that take the shots die, and then the whole system becomes corrupt because they pushed it in the defense of that.
[02:23:59.778 --> 02:24:10.580]  And once you've got them covering their ass in a beta test that killed a bunch of people and maimed a bunch of others, tens of millions, now you've got them and then you can test, will they stay in their houses?
[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:17.062]  Will they behave and watch TV when we release a real weapon that kills 50, 60, 70% of those that come in contact with it?
[02:24:17.062 --> 02:24:18.942]  And they've got those.
[02:24:18.942 --> 02:24:23.043]  They hit you with a chemical too that takes a month to kill you, it looks like a bioweapon.
[02:24:23.043 --> 02:24:25.764]  So it was all a test on, okay,
[02:24:27.025 --> 02:24:28.466]  We put the gun to their head.
[02:24:28.466 --> 02:24:30.246]  Can we pull the trigger?
[02:24:30.246 --> 02:24:33.328]  Is there any way that they can fight us once we do that?
[02:24:33.328 --> 02:24:39.471]  So it was a beta test for the main depopulation operation that's about to come.
[02:24:39.471 --> 02:24:43.973]  And at the end of the day, what focuses my mind is my children.
[02:24:43.973 --> 02:24:48.835]  And if I didn't think we could stop this, I would be in the middle of nowhere in the desert.
[02:24:50.947 --> 02:24:57.890]  Growing crops, grows great in the desert by the way, with solar panels and water collection, and I'd be gone.
[02:24:57.890 --> 02:25:01.212]  And just kind of hoping they didn't get me, you know, first.
[02:25:01.212 --> 02:25:02.272]  I know we can beat this.
[02:25:02.272 --> 02:25:06.974]  Plus, even if we fail, you ask the key question, let me skip to the end, I'll answer your first question.
[02:25:06.974 --> 02:25:12.036]  Let me answer the last question and the second question last.
[02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:20.220]  If I do the right thing in the face of overwhelming odds and tyranny and evil, and I still stay true, I know I'm an eternal spirit,
[02:25:21.724 --> 02:25:29.771]  A living genetic interdimensional program, I will be taken up to the mainframe.
[02:25:29.771 --> 02:25:31.272]  And I know that.
[02:25:31.272 --> 02:25:31.933]  Deep down.
[02:25:31.933 --> 02:25:33.534]  I'm connected to it.
[02:25:33.534 --> 02:25:36.296]  And so, failure is not failure.
[02:25:36.296 --> 02:25:41.160]  But we will actually beat this in the end on this planet.
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:43.402]  But we'll go through hell first.
[02:25:43.402 --> 02:25:47.946]  The devil wins at halftime and in the third quarter he loses in the last five seconds.
[02:25:49.542 --> 02:25:54.385]  So you're not given consciousness and incredible power on this planet for no reason.
[02:25:54.385 --> 02:25:57.487]  It is a test of free will.
[02:25:57.487 --> 02:26:02.811]  And that's how you then transcend.
[02:26:02.811 --> 02:26:13.458]  So it is in the defeat, like Christ on the cross, whipped and tortured and nailed to a cross and his side pierced with a sword or pierced with a spear.
[02:26:13.458 --> 02:26:18.001]  It is in that failure that he was given absolute dominion and the keys to hell and death.
[02:26:19.016 --> 02:26:28.780]  So, if you read the scripture and you study it, we go through hell, we feel like we're losing, but if we're faithful, we win while we're still alive.
[02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:31.241]  But then you sit back and laugh because it's all a joke.
[02:26:31.241 --> 02:26:34.603]  You realize this is just a third dimensional manifestation of your spirit.
[02:26:34.603 --> 02:26:40.465]  Imagine how much greater your spirit is if your body is so amazing, the things you've done are so incredible.
[02:26:40.465 --> 02:26:42.786]  So, it is a process.
[02:26:45.728 --> 02:26:54.013]  The point of the shots is take over your body, control you, manage the death, see if people will go along with the next phase, it's even more intense death.
[02:26:54.013 --> 02:27:01.597]  And there is no losing because it's a spiritual choice of free will, you're being tested.
[02:27:01.597 --> 02:27:08.441]  And so I go back to the middle of your question, your second question, what if we're not winning?
[02:27:08.441 --> 02:27:14.125]  It's an interdimensional spiritual choice that I love justice and I love God, that's the winning.
[02:27:15.319 --> 02:27:28.708]  And the intimidation, the attacks intensify, trying to get you to reject God, trying to get you to give up faith, trying to get you to roll over, trying to get you to commit suicide, trying to get you to not believe in yourself and the God that created you.
[02:27:28.708 --> 02:27:37.334]  And so this is, the journey is the destination.
[02:27:37.334 --> 02:27:38.855]  Now I said I'd break down AI.
[02:27:40.734 --> 02:27:46.879]  I was really thinking this weekend for several hours about it and doing a real deep dive in my mind on research.
[02:27:46.879 --> 02:27:49.941]  I had a real crystallized analysis of it.
[02:27:49.941 --> 02:27:56.847]  There's so many facets to it, but I'm going to try to recapture that in my mind during the break.
[02:27:56.847 --> 02:28:07.575]  It's not, 90% of it comes back to me, but I just, I really want to be able to describe this to you properly.
[02:28:07.575 --> 02:28:08.296]  This is all a lie.
[02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:10.614]  A.I.'
[02:28:10.574 --> 02:28:15.119]  's power is only what you get it.
[02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:18.962]  And it's us interfacing with it that gives it the power.
[02:28:18.962 --> 02:28:23.026]  But that makes it sound like I'm saying we're not in trouble.
[02:28:23.026 --> 02:28:23.266]  A.I.'
[02:28:23.246 --> 02:28:25.328]  's way more advanced than they're admitting.
[02:28:25.328 --> 02:28:28.350]  Things are way worse than you know.
[02:28:28.350 --> 02:28:30.532]  But they're way better than you know.
[02:28:30.532 --> 02:28:33.595]  Because you're now admitting God is real.
[02:28:33.595 --> 02:28:34.736]  Is your God gonna be A.I.
[02:28:34.736 --> 02:28:35.397]  and Chuckie Schumer?
[02:28:36.383 --> 02:28:42.149]  And the Democratic Party and Prince Charles, King Charles, are going to be Jesus Christ.
[02:28:42.149 --> 02:28:45.913]  He will be forced to make a choice.
[02:28:45.913 --> 02:28:49.297]  Don't fear he who can kill the body, fear he who can kill the soul.
[02:28:49.297 --> 02:28:51.940]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.460]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.619 --> 02:29:03.904]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[02:29:03.904 --> 02:29:06.866]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:29:06.866 --> 02:29:16.414]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:29:16.414 --> 02:29:18.356]  The number one preventable cause
[02:29:19.076 --> 02:29:29.985]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[02:29:29.985 --> 02:29:39.913]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:29:39.913 --> 02:29:42.295]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[02:29:42.295 --> 02:29:45.357]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[02:29:46.118 --> 02:29:47.939]  It supercharges your body.
[02:29:47.939 --> 02:29:50.641]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:31:02.476 --> 02:31:04.656]  We made it even stronger.

[02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:21.362]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:31:21.362 --> 02:31:22.803]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:31:23.463 --> 02:31:36.533]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:31:36.533 --> 02:31:38.514]  It is the super fuel.
[02:31:38.514 --> 02:31:39.995]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:31:39.995 --> 02:31:40.856]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:31:40.856 --> 02:31:41.817]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:31:41.817 --> 02:31:42.997]  They go good with this.
[02:31:42.997 --> 02:31:45.019]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:47.221]  This is the Boss.
[02:31:47.221 --> 02:31:47.962]  TurboForce.

[02:32:59.389 --> 02:33:13.921]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:13.921 --> 02:33:22.328]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here, on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:37.921 --> 02:33:42.885]  We're good to go.
[02:34:30.282 --> 02:34:35.564]  Alright, I'm going to be talking a lot more about AI in the future.
[02:34:35.564 --> 02:34:37.145]  But let me just set the table this way.
[02:34:37.145 --> 02:34:52.132]  I am blessed in my position to be able to talk to some of the top scientists that work for Elon Musk, that work for MIT, that work for Google, that work for Microsoft, that work for the Pentagon.
[02:34:53.988 --> 02:34:57.570]  And I've also done my own studying about what they've been trying to do from the beginning.
[02:34:57.570 --> 02:34:59.691]  So I could talk for 10 hours about it.
[02:34:59.691 --> 02:35:03.112]  But here's the final equation.
[02:35:03.112 --> 02:35:08.035]  Humans have a choice whether we want to make ourselves obsolete or not.
[02:35:08.035 --> 02:35:14.818]  We have a choice whether we want to cease to do things ourselves because it's, quote, easier or let something else do it.
[02:35:14.818 --> 02:35:22.422]  But the truth is, if you just laid there in a chair and didn't walk or didn't lift weights or didn't do exercise, you'd be a totally unhealthy, unhappy person.
[02:35:24.133 --> 02:35:32.756]  So, six months ago or so, it was a big national news story, Alex Jones attacks the calculator.
[02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:44.581]  And they took out of context what I said in like a 10 minute segment, explaining that they didn't let me, when I was in public school, use a calculator.
[02:35:44.581 --> 02:35:51.364]  So I had to learn, I was not good at math, but I passed the classes, algebra and trigonometry and all the rest of it.
[02:35:52.930 --> 02:35:57.834]  And it was amazing once I finally figured it out and my brain was doing it.
[02:35:57.834 --> 02:35:59.175]  Here's an example.
[02:35:59.175 --> 02:36:00.636]  A microcosm.
[02:36:00.636 --> 02:36:07.461]  Just 15 years ago, almost everybody watched TV and listened to radio.
[02:36:07.461 --> 02:36:09.382]  And it was transmitted.
[02:36:09.382 --> 02:36:16.027]  It came to you, you tuned in, you watched it, you listened to it, it didn't listen to you.
[02:36:16.027 --> 02:36:18.949]  Now TV and radio and everything else watches you.
[02:36:18.949 --> 02:36:22.232]  You think you're watching it, but it's really the AI scooping it all up.
[02:36:24.269 --> 02:36:25.890]  Everything is two-way.
[02:36:25.890 --> 02:36:40.003]  Like in Lord of the Rings, they have the crystal ball, the palantir, and they're looking at it, and Gandalf throws a sheet over it and says, we don't know who got the other ones, we don't know who else is watching.
[02:36:40.003 --> 02:36:45.528]  And of course, Sauron's watching, as soon as they throw the sheet over it.
[02:36:45.528 --> 02:36:47.710]  And so you can say, well that's fiction, that's fantasy.
[02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:48.971]  No, that's what it is.
[02:36:50.057 --> 02:36:54.239]  So we didn't design an infrastructure that puts us in charge, because the globalists don't want us in charge.
[02:36:54.239 --> 02:36:59.642]  They don't want our hopes, our dreams, our ideas, our collective vision to, through free market, come together.
[02:36:59.642 --> 02:37:02.463]  They want to direct us.
[02:37:02.463 --> 02:37:03.584]  They want to end our free will.
[02:37:03.584 --> 02:37:04.904]  They want to control us.
[02:37:04.904 --> 02:37:09.187]  And so AI, at one level, is the biggest plagiarist the galaxy's ever seen.
[02:37:09.187 --> 02:37:17.931]  It takes our art, our ideas, our systems, our essays, our thoughts, scrambles it all together, and then we look at it and say, wow, this is incredible, and I'm reading
[02:37:19.699 --> 02:37:24.722]  An AI article about God, and I see Shakespeare in there.
[02:37:24.722 --> 02:37:27.825]  And I see Foucault.
[02:37:27.825 --> 02:37:29.966]  And I see Carl Jung.
[02:37:29.966 --> 02:37:34.309]  But I've read all that, so I know I'm reading Carl Jung!
[02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:46.918]  Here's my essay on God, and it takes all the, you know, people going back 500 years, the top minds on it, and shows you pieces of what they said, and then you say, this thing is incredible!
[02:37:46.918 --> 02:37:48.819]  No, we are incredible!
[02:37:51.468 --> 02:37:54.270]  So it's a plagiarist.
[02:37:54.270 --> 02:37:58.512]  But more importantly, it's stealing your identity.
[02:37:58.512 --> 02:38:06.757]  They're now saying, as I envisioned 20 years ago, that when you die, you'll be able to hold a machine, it'll sound like your mom, it'll look like your mom, everything she said or did, everything's correct.
[02:38:06.757 --> 02:38:10.979]  It'll fool you, it's voice print will fool you, but it's not your mother.
[02:38:10.979 --> 02:38:13.460]  Guys, pull up The Exorcist clip, I'm about to send it to you.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.121]  It's a very short clip.
[02:38:15.121 --> 02:38:17.723]  You're not my mother, The Exorcist, and the demon,
[02:38:19.039 --> 02:38:26.944]  The text of the devil is saying to the Catholic priest, in perfect Italian, and then it speaks in English to him, baby, I love you, why'd you do this?
[02:38:26.944 --> 02:38:29.185]  Because the devil was there, the devil saw it when he was a kid.
[02:38:29.185 --> 02:38:33.888]  It's not AI, it's not God, but, and AI's not God, but the devil's more like AI.
[02:38:33.888 --> 02:38:38.130]  It grabs things it knows, and then it's a facsimile, it's a lie.
[02:38:38.130 --> 02:38:40.312]  He goes, you're not my mother!
[02:38:40.312 --> 02:38:43.133]  And Max von Sydow says, stop responding to it!
[02:38:43.133 --> 02:38:43.954]  And that's the answer.
[02:38:45.092 --> 02:38:47.334]  I'm like, well, we're already down the rat hole here, aren't we?
[02:38:47.334 --> 02:38:55.760]  It already grabs everything, we already opted into it, it already knows who we are, it can already misrepresent whatever it wants, and it's programmed by the globalists to carry out the aims it wants.
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:58.001]  Look at all the major AIs.
[02:38:58.001 --> 02:38:59.963]  It's leftist.
[02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:02.044]  USAI, CHATGPT, any of it.
[02:39:02.044 --> 02:39:03.345]  Is it okay to be white?
[02:39:03.345 --> 02:39:03.645]  No.
[02:39:03.645 --> 02:39:05.587]  White people are inherently bad and racist and evil.
[02:39:05.587 --> 02:39:06.327]  Is it okay to be black?
[02:39:06.327 --> 02:39:06.567]  Yes.
[02:39:06.567 --> 02:39:08.128]  Blacks are downtrodden the best people ever.
[02:39:08.128 --> 02:39:09.249]  It doesn't care about blacks.
[02:39:09.249 --> 02:39:10.930]  It's creating a collision.
[02:39:10.930 --> 02:39:11.791]  It's been programmed.
[02:39:14.801 --> 02:39:21.626]  So now, you have Elon Musk coming out, he's been doing it for years, saying AI is dangerous, we got to control it, we got to have a hiatus.
[02:39:21.626 --> 02:39:22.967]  It was a six-month hiatus.
[02:39:22.967 --> 02:39:40.541]  I've talked to more than 10 top AI scientists, some of them are well-known names, and they said, Alex, four years ago, the establishment was even concerned, they put a hiatus on AI.
[02:39:41.656 --> 02:39:46.060]  Not on what it was doing, but on implementing what it could do.
[02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:51.904]  So it was already watching, grabbing, collating, tracking, becoming more powerful.
[02:39:51.904 --> 02:39:54.787]  The main Google program is the most powerful, and that's public.
[02:39:54.787 --> 02:39:56.968]  That's actually accurate.
[02:39:56.968 --> 02:39:58.990]  But they wouldn't let you know what it can do.
[02:39:58.990 --> 02:40:01.312]  It wasn't using its functions.
[02:40:01.312 --> 02:40:06.977]  It wasn't using its powers.
[02:40:06.977 --> 02:40:07.157]  So,
[02:40:10.305 --> 02:40:12.406]  They've already had a hiatus.
[02:40:12.406 --> 02:40:13.306]  It's gathering data.
[02:40:13.306 --> 02:40:14.927]  It's getting stronger.
[02:40:14.927 --> 02:40:19.029]  It hasn't shown you with voice print or any of the systems what it's got yet.
[02:40:19.029 --> 02:40:22.030]  And now they've decided to go, Oh, we're all scared of it.
[02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:26.832]  Oh, now we're going to start slowly rolling it all out.
[02:40:26.832 --> 02:40:27.553]  I actually have the clip.
[02:40:27.553 --> 02:40:29.053]  I'll send it to you guys.
[02:40:29.053 --> 02:40:31.895]  No luck on YouTube with Exorcist clip.
[02:40:31.895 --> 02:40:35.456]  You're not my mother.
[02:40:35.456 --> 02:40:38.858]  Really?
[02:40:38.858 --> 02:40:39.258]  I'll find it.
[02:40:42.173 --> 02:40:44.775]  I will find it.
[02:40:44.775 --> 02:40:45.475]  Very easy to find.
[02:40:45.475 --> 02:40:48.377]  It was actually sent to me the other day.
[02:40:48.377 --> 02:40:51.959]  You know, I'll just go to break.
[02:40:51.959 --> 02:40:52.940]  We'll cover it when we have that.
[02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:55.721]  Because I'm going to cover it once we have that.
[02:40:55.721 --> 02:41:00.604]  I kind of have this neurotic need to have it.
[02:41:00.604 --> 02:41:01.565]  You just go to YouTube.
[02:41:01.565 --> 02:41:05.307]  You type in The Exorcist.
[02:41:05.307 --> 02:41:08.169]  The Exorcist.
[02:41:10.393 --> 02:41:12.275]  You... Yep, there it is.
[02:41:12.275 --> 02:41:22.905]  Came right up.
[02:41:22.905 --> 02:41:23.806]  Oh, I just can't hear you.
[02:41:23.806 --> 02:41:24.486]  Here comes a mother.
[02:41:24.486 --> 02:41:25.868]  Alright.
[02:41:25.868 --> 02:41:27.149]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:41:27.149 --> 02:41:27.870]  Oh, you have it now.
[02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:29.371]  Okay, that's great.
[02:41:29.371 --> 02:41:30.652]  Okay, so go ahead and play it for people.
[02:41:30.652 --> 02:41:33.575]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:41:33.575 --> 02:41:34.716]  You're not my mother!
[02:41:36.144 --> 02:41:37.645]  Don't listen.
[02:41:37.645 --> 02:41:38.366]  Don't listen.
[02:41:38.366 --> 02:41:39.447]  Don't listen.
[02:41:39.447 --> 02:41:40.368]  Get the full clip.
[02:41:40.368 --> 02:41:43.871]  Get the full clip or at least I want to add it in post.
[02:41:43.871 --> 02:41:47.754]  It's about a one minute clip.
[02:41:47.754 --> 02:41:48.435]  I'll find it.
[02:41:48.435 --> 02:41:49.076]  It's no problem.
[02:41:49.076 --> 02:41:50.357]  But the point is is that
[02:42:00.006 --> 02:42:01.307]  It's not your mother.
[02:42:01.307 --> 02:42:03.487]  It sounds like your mother.
[02:42:03.487 --> 02:42:09.370]  It can even look like your mother, but your mother is connected to millions of people before you.
[02:42:09.370 --> 02:42:10.050]  That's real.
[02:42:10.050 --> 02:42:10.970]  Our flesh is real.
[02:42:10.970 --> 02:42:12.231]  Our soul is real.
[02:42:12.231 --> 02:42:21.114]  And just because something can mimic something, in nature there's all sorts of snakes that look like another snake, and a butterfly looks like another butterfly, but it's not the real McCoy.
[02:42:21.114 --> 02:42:23.795]  So what it is, is fraud.
[02:42:23.795 --> 02:42:25.736]  So it's way advanced of what they're telling you.
[02:42:30.691 --> 02:42:31.371]  There's a lot of other points.
[02:42:31.371 --> 02:42:33.852]  It gives me a headache trying to get into it.
[02:42:33.852 --> 02:42:39.754]  But... Any new technological system they push, we gotta resist.
[02:42:39.754 --> 02:42:42.435]  Because all of it is a post-human system.
[02:42:42.435 --> 02:42:46.336]  And just... I didn't finish the calculator rant.
[02:42:46.336 --> 02:42:47.236]  When we come back, I'll start there.
[02:42:47.236 --> 02:42:48.417]  Because there's thousands of points here.
[02:42:48.417 --> 02:42:51.238]  And it takes time to get into each one.
[02:42:51.238 --> 02:42:51.598]  Stay with us.
[02:42:51.598 --> 02:42:52.018]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:57.875 --> 02:43:00.457]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:43:00.457 --> 02:43:02.718]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:43:02.718 --> 02:43:04.700]  It will change your life.
[02:43:04.700 --> 02:43:13.466]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:43:13.466 --> 02:43:18.790]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:20.271]  Most iodine in the environment
[02:43:20.951 --> 02:43:24.514]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:43:24.514 --> 02:43:28.958]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:43:28.958 --> 02:43:36.045]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:43:36.045 --> 02:43:42.071]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:43:42.611 --> 02:43:44.993]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:43:44.993 --> 02:43:47.234]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:43:47.234 --> 02:43:49.035]  You and your family need it.
[02:43:49.035 --> 02:43:50.797]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:43:50.797 --> 02:43:54.999]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[02:43:54.999 --> 02:44:01.164]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:44:01.164 --> 02:44:02.785]  You need to get
[02:44:07.930 --> 02:44:14.872]  Coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:44:14.872 --> 02:44:17.052]  So support InfoWarsStore.
[02:44:17.052 --> 02:44:21.474]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know.
[02:44:21.474 --> 02:44:21.974]  I don't know.
[02:44:21.974 --> 02:44:25.535]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:44:25.535 --> 02:44:30.196]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:44:30.196 --> 02:44:31.096]  Krill oil.
[02:44:31.096 --> 02:44:33.797]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a
[02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:34.977]  Thank you.
[02:44:58.047 --> 02:45:01.069]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[02:45:01.069 --> 02:45:05.853]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[02:45:05.853 --> 02:45:10.977]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer, and our products are not any different.
[02:45:10.977 --> 02:45:17.563]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try, if you've never tried them, or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[02:45:17.563 --> 02:45:22.126]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[02:45:22.126 --> 02:45:25.269]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[02:45:25.709 --> 02:45:27.370]  You want to go research.
[02:45:27.370 --> 02:45:33.454]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[02:45:33.454 --> 02:45:34.835]  But they're selling out quick.
[02:45:34.835 --> 02:45:37.497]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[02:45:37.497 --> 02:45:40.739]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[02:45:40.739 --> 02:45:43.081]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[02:45:43.081 --> 02:45:44.181]  It's about to sell out.
[02:45:44.181 --> 02:45:51.887]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:45:51.887 --> 02:45:52.967]  Thank you for your support.
[02:45:58.833 --> 02:46:01.977]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:46:01.977 --> 02:46:04.280]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:08.225]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:46:08.225 --> 02:46:12.170]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:46:13.601 --> 02:46:17.122]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:46:17.122 --> 02:46:25.964]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:46:25.964 --> 02:46:28.845]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:46:28.845 --> 02:46:34.547]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:46:35.387 --> 02:46:36.328]  I know you spread the word.
[02:46:36.328 --> 02:46:37.849]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:46:37.849 --> 02:46:38.429]  Keep doing it.
[02:46:38.429 --> 02:46:47.376]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarestore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:46:47.376 --> 02:46:51.680]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarestore.com.
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:56.623]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarestore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:46:56.623 --> 02:46:58.925]  Please take action now.
[02:46:58.925 --> 02:47:04.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:14.019 --> 02:47:14.459]  A.I.
[02:47:14.459 --> 02:47:15.799]  is a plagiarer.
[02:47:15.799 --> 02:47:16.659]  It's a counterfeiter.
[02:47:16.659 --> 02:47:17.960]  It's a stealer of identities.
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:25.201]  It takes all our art and culture, all our information, and re-presents it to us as if it is the author.
[02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:29.882]  But, what it really does is steal everything we are and uses it against us.
[02:47:29.882 --> 02:47:30.742]  Wait to crust.
[02:47:30.742 --> 02:47:33.182]  And put some nutmegs.
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:55.587]  Demi, why you do this to me?
[02:47:55.587 --> 02:48:00.472]  Please Demi, I'm afraid.
[02:48:00.472 --> 02:48:01.473]  You're not my mother.
[02:48:01.473 --> 02:48:04.517]  Demi, please!
[02:48:18.962 --> 02:48:25.604]  What is it?
[02:48:25.604 --> 02:48:27.265]  Her heart.
[02:48:27.265 --> 02:48:29.286]  Can you give her something?
[02:48:29.286 --> 02:48:31.467]  She's going to coma.
[02:48:31.467 --> 02:48:32.307]  You're not my father!
[02:48:32.307 --> 02:48:32.687]  Don't listen.
[02:48:32.687 --> 02:48:32.807]  Why?
[02:48:32.807 --> 02:48:33.287]  Jamie!
[02:48:33.287 --> 02:48:34.187]  Jamie, please!
[02:48:49.716 --> 02:48:53.258]  So that's the best description of AI right there.
[02:48:53.258 --> 02:48:54.098]  It's a fraud.
[02:48:54.098 --> 02:48:54.698]  It's a fake.
[02:48:54.698 --> 02:48:56.099]  It's controlled by the enemy.
[02:48:56.099 --> 02:48:58.340]  It's designed to destroy you and make you obsolete.
[02:48:58.340 --> 02:49:04.143]  So I go back to a couple months ago, six months ago, whatever it was, big story where Alex Jones attacks the calculator.
[02:49:04.143 --> 02:49:05.243]  Alex Jones is Amish.
[02:49:05.243 --> 02:49:08.545]  Alex Jones, no.
[02:49:08.545 --> 02:49:09.385]  I'm for technology.
[02:49:09.385 --> 02:49:11.146]  We control this transparent.
[02:49:11.146 --> 02:49:12.407]  The calculator, not against it.
[02:49:13.322 --> 02:49:26.488]  But if you don't train someone to be able to do math without it, then you have no mathematical skills in your brain and all those neurons and things that trains your brain to do that all the studies show literally makes you live longer, makes you not get Alzheimer's.
[02:49:26.488 --> 02:49:32.331]  If you're 15 learning algebra, when you're 80, you have a better brain because your brain had to figure that out.
[02:49:34.141 --> 02:49:37.943]  Like, hey, I don't want to drive my car, let's let the computer drive it.
[02:49:37.943 --> 02:49:40.244]  It builds a world where humans aren't needed.
[02:49:40.244 --> 02:49:43.165]  So the globalists tell us we're obsolete, time to get rid of you.
[02:49:43.165 --> 02:49:47.888]  Hey, if you're convenience, adopt all this.
[02:49:47.888 --> 02:49:50.069]  And it's all meant to destroy us.
[02:49:50.069 --> 02:49:53.070]  So it's way more advanced than they've been telling you.
[02:49:53.070 --> 02:49:55.432]  It's designed to take over markets, take over industries.
[02:49:55.432 --> 02:49:57.833]  Here's just one microcosm.
[02:49:57.833 --> 02:50:01.274]  It's a macrocosm.
[02:50:01.274 --> 02:50:01.315]  AI
[02:50:02.881 --> 02:50:05.762]  Current versions could publish a billion articles a day.
[02:50:05.762 --> 02:50:09.003]  Just one computer.
[02:50:09.003 --> 02:50:22.748]  And then if big tech sits there and calls human information disinfo, but anything that's corporate or approved AI, it's just everywhere and no one can even counter it because we're suppressed and it's not.
[02:50:22.748 --> 02:50:25.610]  Notice how the fact checkers day one aren't looking for AI articles.
[02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:27.150]  They've been around for 10 years.
[02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:28.331]  They now admit that.
[02:50:28.331 --> 02:50:29.211]  Told you about a decade ago.
[02:50:30.307 --> 02:50:33.429]  No, it's all about worrying about what humans say and humans do.
[02:50:33.429 --> 02:50:43.437]  No, we should demand a pro-human future, and a system that builds up humans, and a system that builds up the truth, but instead it's about defending lies.
[02:50:43.437 --> 02:50:49.281]  So it's just another tool, and again, it's only power is how much control we give it.
[02:50:49.281 --> 02:50:59.268]  I told a MIT leader in AI a couple years ago at dinner with Joe Rogan, and I said, let me tell you what the most powerful AI on earth is.
[02:50:59.268 --> 02:50:59.809]  He said, what is it?
[02:51:01.405 --> 02:51:06.187]  I said, it's the red lights, it's the green lights, it's the traffic system.
[02:51:06.187 --> 02:51:14.069]  It's super stupid, it's very simple, but it's the most powerful system interfacing with humans that we dutifully follow.
[02:51:14.069 --> 02:51:19.991]  And to me, the success of an AI system is, how much can it get us to submit to it?
[02:51:19.991 --> 02:51:22.572]  He said, I never thought of that, but that's very deep.
[02:51:22.572 --> 02:51:23.732]  So that's absolutely right.
[02:51:23.732 --> 02:51:26.874]  We are trying to be able to interface with it and follow it.
[02:51:26.874 --> 02:51:27.934]  So it's centralized.
[02:51:29.591 --> 02:51:40.280]  And it's an AI war of a bunch of AI systems that are battling to get the most data and the most control to then feed us back the propaganda that it's been programmed to sell.
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:50.608]  Remember that whole movement that was pushed, you know, 15, 20 years ago?
[02:51:50.608 --> 02:51:56.233]  The different projects to build this utopia where a computer runs everything.
[02:51:57.082 --> 02:51:57.322]  Hey, Alex.
[02:51:57.322 --> 02:51:58.583]  Thanks for taking my call, man.
[02:51:58.583 --> 02:51:58.683]  Hello?
[02:52:27.253 --> 02:52:32.701]  Hey, so yeah man, just to smash on what you're saying about AI.
[02:52:32.701 --> 02:52:34.464]  What they are calling AI, AI is...
[02:52:35.726 --> 02:52:37.046]  It's science fiction.
[02:52:37.046 --> 02:52:38.887]  You know, AI is not a real thing.
[02:52:38.887 --> 02:52:41.428]  It can never be a real thing, right?
[02:52:41.428 --> 02:52:49.090]  Intelligence is a mental faculty and mind does not exist on the physical plane.
[02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:50.510]  So we can never create intelligence.
[02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:50.910]  That's right.
[02:52:50.910 --> 02:52:51.710]  It can't love a sunset.
[02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:52.791]  It can't smell a flower.
[02:52:52.791 --> 02:52:56.452]  It can just tell you what humans said about smelling a flower or seeing a sunset.
[02:52:56.452 --> 02:52:57.692]  It can't connect to God.
[02:52:58.192 --> 02:53:02.659]  More importantly, which is, you know, where our power really comes from.
[02:53:02.659 --> 02:53:04.582]  It's all spiritual, man.
[02:53:04.582 --> 02:53:07.147]  It's not physical, right?
[02:53:07.147 --> 02:53:11.834]  So what they call AI really is what we should be calling HRT.
[02:53:12.955 --> 02:53:15.056]  Human Replacement Technology.
[02:53:15.056 --> 02:53:16.877]  And you're all over it.
[02:53:16.877 --> 02:53:17.857]  I'm taking that.
[02:53:17.857 --> 02:53:19.218]  That's a great term.
[02:53:19.218 --> 02:53:21.639]  Human Replacement Technology.
[02:53:21.639 --> 02:53:22.779]  That's what all this is.
[02:53:22.779 --> 02:53:24.360]  And that's what it is.
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:28.602]  And they're letting us program our replacement tech.
[02:53:28.602 --> 02:53:29.222]  That's right.
[02:53:29.222 --> 02:53:30.803]  They admit machine learning.
[02:53:30.803 --> 02:53:32.824]  We're training our replacement.
[02:53:32.824 --> 02:53:34.245]  Why would we be doing that?
[02:53:34.245 --> 02:53:38.646]  It ties into everything else that we've been talking about for 10 years, right?
[02:53:38.646 --> 02:53:39.647]  Depopulation.
[02:53:40.365 --> 02:53:41.946]  We know that they're coming after us.
[02:53:41.946 --> 02:53:43.467]  They want to kill us.
[02:53:43.467 --> 02:53:44.367]  It's documented.
[02:53:44.367 --> 02:53:45.588]  We know this.
[02:53:45.588 --> 02:53:50.250]  We are literally helping them program our replacements.
[02:53:50.250 --> 02:53:50.630]  That's right.
[02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:56.013]  We're not just like IBM people 20 years ago replacing, you know, training their end-to-end replacements.
[02:53:56.013 --> 02:53:59.975]  We're training the machines to replace us.
[02:53:59.975 --> 02:54:00.255]  Correct.
[02:54:01.761 --> 02:54:16.027]  So, just to hammer on to something else you were talking about earlier, you said that you thought that God put us here to fight, to try to fix all of this, and I don't necessarily agree with that.
[02:54:16.027 --> 02:54:28.712]  I take the opposite viewpoint, right, where I think that God put us here to build something truly good, something truly better for the first time maybe in human history, right?
[02:54:28.712 --> 02:54:29.052]  And so,
[02:54:30.478 --> 02:54:31.799]  For that, I have a quote.
[02:54:31.799 --> 02:54:35.281]  It's from a guy, a really smart guy named Buckminster Fuller.
[02:54:35.281 --> 02:54:38.702]  He said, you never change things by fighting the existing reality.
[02:54:38.702 --> 02:54:42.965]  To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.
[02:54:42.965 --> 02:54:44.606]  No, I agree with that.
[02:54:44.606 --> 02:54:47.027]  And that's what I think that we're here to do now.
[02:54:47.027 --> 02:54:47.827]  Us, our children.
[02:54:47.827 --> 02:54:48.628]  Well, no, I agree with that.
[02:54:48.628 --> 02:54:50.088]  That's how we fight, is building a new world.
[02:54:50.088 --> 02:54:52.430]  I actually agree with you.
[02:54:52.430 --> 02:54:52.730]  Yes.
[02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:53.590]  That's the solution.
[02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:54.911]  It's not to try to fix.
[02:54:54.911 --> 02:54:56.572]  We have to try to build something better.
[02:54:57.415 --> 02:55:02.799]  And so, that way, everything is more attractive.
[02:55:02.799 --> 02:55:04.861]  We're not resisting, we're creating.
[02:55:04.861 --> 02:55:05.421]  I agree.
[02:55:05.421 --> 02:55:06.502]  Beautiful call, Brandon.
[02:55:06.502 --> 02:55:07.803]  I could talk to you for hours.
[02:55:07.803 --> 02:55:08.824]  Gotta talk to others, though.
[02:55:08.824 --> 02:55:10.325]  Dennis in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:55:10.325 --> 02:55:12.447]  Go ahead.
[02:55:12.447 --> 02:55:15.809]  Alex, I love you, man.
[02:55:15.809 --> 02:55:19.973]  Man to man, I love you.
[02:55:19.973 --> 02:55:25.457]  And from watching you on Sunday with Pete Santilli, I really want you to reconsider
[02:55:26.681 --> 02:55:28.402]  Going to the southern border.
[02:55:28.402 --> 02:55:33.286]  I don't want the next shot to be heard around the world to be you.
[02:55:33.286 --> 02:55:35.928]  I really think that you should reconsider that.
[02:55:35.928 --> 02:55:40.891]  Or, in my best opinion, I wish you'd have just went and not told anybody.
[02:55:40.891 --> 02:55:43.513]  Versus telling people and then gone.
[02:55:43.513 --> 02:55:45.595]  Yeah, but I can die in a car wreck today.
[02:55:45.595 --> 02:55:47.616]  We'll see what happens.
[02:55:47.616 --> 02:55:50.218]  But we gotta go cover stuff like this.
[02:55:50.218 --> 02:55:51.559]  I understand.
[02:55:51.559 --> 02:55:52.579]  Send somebody else.
[02:55:52.579 --> 02:55:54.561]  I just don't think it's
[02:55:55.271 --> 02:55:59.814]  A good idea of you personally, or even Owen, or someone of that stature.
[02:55:59.814 --> 02:56:07.898]  Maybe send somebody that's, you know, just not noticeable like that.
[02:56:07.898 --> 02:56:10.600]  I mean, you're a public figure, man.
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:13.041]  And I just, I'll pray for you.
[02:56:13.041 --> 02:56:14.742]  Please, God, I'll pray for you.
[02:56:14.742 --> 02:56:19.045]  Well, me and you and all the audience, I was planning to go down there like next week.
[02:56:19.045 --> 02:56:24.108]  Owen and the crew's going down there on Wednesday, but at the same time, I gotta put Skim in the game.
[02:56:25.675 --> 02:56:26.536]  I know it.
[02:56:26.536 --> 02:56:27.116]  I love you, man.
[02:56:27.116 --> 02:56:29.638]  I'll continue to pray for you.
[02:56:29.638 --> 02:56:31.620]  But you're right, it is an insane asylum down there.
[02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:34.802]  What do you think is going to unfold?
[02:56:34.802 --> 02:56:38.765]  Well, it's just, um, everybody wants to think about Title 42.
[02:56:38.765 --> 02:56:43.969]  There was no Title 42 to begin with, if you look at it.
[02:56:43.969 --> 02:56:44.589]  Exactly!
[02:56:44.589 --> 02:56:45.710]  There's no border anyways.
[02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:49.253]  There's no border anyway, so what does it matter?
[02:56:49.253 --> 02:56:52.695]  I'm trying to tell you, this is about to get really, really bad.
[02:56:52.695 --> 02:56:54.937]  They imported a whole third world.
[02:56:57.353 --> 02:56:58.673]  It's about to get really bad.
[02:56:58.673 --> 02:57:00.614]  These people have... Don't get me wrong.
[02:57:00.614 --> 02:57:01.774]  Yes, some are good.
[02:57:01.774 --> 02:57:04.235]  But, you know, let's be realistic.
[02:57:04.235 --> 02:57:06.436]  They're not going to assimilate here.
[02:57:06.436 --> 02:57:08.116]  They're not.
[02:57:08.116 --> 02:57:10.677]  They're just not.
[02:57:10.677 --> 02:57:12.398]  They are entitled now.
[02:57:12.398 --> 02:57:14.838]  So this is about to get really out of hand.
[02:57:14.838 --> 02:57:18.900]  We thought we were seeing people squatting in houses and stuff like that.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:21.160]  Imagine... And it's the truth.
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:23.821]  Thank you to these, uh, sanctuary cities.
[02:57:23.821 --> 02:57:25.582]  Now they're getting it.
[02:57:25.582 --> 02:57:26.862]  See, it just... It happens.
[02:57:27.463 --> 02:57:29.284]  This is what they did.
[02:57:29.284 --> 02:57:30.784]  This is what they did.
[02:57:30.784 --> 02:57:34.426]  And I just don't... I just don't want you to be in that kind of position.
[02:57:34.426 --> 02:57:37.547]  To be... I love you too, Dennis, and I care about you.
[02:57:37.547 --> 02:57:38.587]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:38.587 --> 02:57:39.788]  Warning taken.
[02:57:39.788 --> 02:57:41.068]  Phoenix, you're up next.
[02:57:41.068 --> 02:57:42.129]  And then Gerald Celente.
[02:57:42.129 --> 02:57:42.529]  Stay with us.
[02:57:48.558 --> 02:57:51.139]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:57:51.139 --> 02:57:53.401]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:57:53.401 --> 02:57:55.402]  It will change your life.
[02:57:55.402 --> 02:58:04.146]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:58:04.146 --> 02:58:09.469]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:58:09.469 --> 02:58:10.950]  Most iodine in the environment
[02:58:11.650 --> 02:58:15.194]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:58:15.194 --> 02:58:19.658]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:58:19.658 --> 02:58:26.745]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:58:26.745 --> 02:58:32.751]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:58:33.311 --> 02:58:35.673]  I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:58:35.673 --> 02:58:37.935]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:58:37.935 --> 02:58:39.737]  You and your family need it.
[02:58:39.737 --> 02:58:41.478]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:58:41.478 --> 02:58:45.702]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[02:58:45.702 --> 02:58:48.164]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:58:55.650 --> 02:58:59.394]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:58:59.394 --> 02:59:04.539]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:04.539 --> 02:59:12.386]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:59:12.386 --> 02:59:13.788]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:59:14.475 --> 02:59:27.542]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:59:27.542 --> 02:59:29.523]  It is the super fuel.
[02:59:29.523 --> 02:59:31.003]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:59:31.003 --> 02:59:31.864]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:59:31.864 --> 02:59:32.824]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:59:32.824 --> 02:59:34.005]  They go good with this.
[02:59:34.005 --> 02:59:36.026]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:59:36.764 --> 02:59:38.225]  This is the Boss.
[02:59:38.225 --> 02:59:38.966]  TurboForce.
[02:59:38.966 --> 02:59:40.007]  Back in stock.
[02:59:40.007 --> 02:59:41.008]  Discounted.
[02:59:41.008 --> 02:59:42.729]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:42.729 --> 02:59:43.610]  More power.
[02:59:43.610 --> 02:59:44.611]  More strength.
[02:59:44.611 --> 02:59:50.676]  More energy.
[02:59:50.676 --> 02:59:55.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:12.583 --> 03:00:14.064]  Alright, Joe Salenta is coming up.
[03:00:14.064 --> 03:00:16.787]  We're going to talk about Tucker Carlson before I hand the baton to him next segment.
[03:00:16.787 --> 03:00:18.148]  Right now we're taking your calls.
[03:00:18.148 --> 03:00:20.149]  Phoenix in Wisconsin, thank you for calling.
[03:00:20.149 --> 03:00:22.752]  Welcome.
[03:00:22.752 --> 03:00:24.633]  Hey, Mr. Jones, am I coming in clear?
[03:00:24.633 --> 03:00:26.695]  You are, loud and clear.
[03:00:26.695 --> 03:00:36.423]  Alright, for people like you and I, Alex, who are experienced rabbit holers, all of this is a shake and bake combo attack that the Hidden Hand has done many times in history.
[03:00:36.423 --> 03:00:39.766]  I see the shooting and the shootings and attacks as a multi-dimensional
[03:00:40.290 --> 03:00:54.855]  Population control, MKUltra mind control linked up with AI and supercomputers in tandem with CI operation Midnight Climax using drugs, sex, money, and nudging to turn people into killers.
[03:00:54.855 --> 03:01:06.819]  Those patsies most often don't even know they're under mind control because the programming positions them that they can't even ponder the fighting of the MKUltra programming because they don't even know it's there.
[03:01:06.819 --> 03:01:08.420]  Going deeper, these patsies spawn
[03:01:09.355 --> 03:01:34.653]  Superkillers nudge the greater population in tandem with AI and supercomputers to push the masses to give up their freedoms and accept and concede to greater government control, higher taxes, and eventually breeding programs between hostile, non-compatible migrant caravans with domestic women, whilst also feminizing and demoralizing the domestic male population, turning them all into slaves in their own country.
[03:01:35.211 --> 03:01:40.093]  Eventually it's like that song lyric, you know, uh, the world is a vampire.
[03:01:40.093 --> 03:01:46.716]  The country and the population is stuffed dry and erased from the history books via control of the media and the history books.
[03:01:46.716 --> 03:01:55.860]  Uh, y'all can expect to get, I think, much, much worse, where I think they're going to start going after entire elementary schools if we don't, um, rise like the phoenix.
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:02:04.303]  You know, at least we forget that Project Paperclip, all those Nazis that came here, were mostly, uh, psy-op, Nazi, uh, psychologists.
[03:02:04.690 --> 03:02:10.513]  Who convinced the entire German population to commit the atrocities we all saw in World War II.
[03:02:10.513 --> 03:02:12.254]  And kill themselves in the process.
[03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:12.974]  Amazing points.
[03:02:12.974 --> 03:02:13.975]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:02:13.975 --> 03:02:15.475]  Incredible callers.
[03:02:15.475 --> 03:02:17.516]  Let's talk to Lauren in North Carolina.
[03:02:17.516 --> 03:02:20.318]  Husband's a doctor, forced out due to vaccine refusal.
[03:02:20.318 --> 03:02:21.238]  Go ahead.
[03:02:21.238 --> 03:02:22.859]  Taking off what?
[03:02:22.859 --> 03:02:23.519]  Oh, hello.
[03:02:23.519 --> 03:02:24.280]  Can you hear me?
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:24.900]  Welcome, Lauren.
[03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:27.041]  Go ahead.
[03:02:27.041 --> 03:02:27.301]  Hi.
[03:02:27.301 --> 03:02:31.563]  You're on speaker with my husband and I. We're in the car picking up our daughter.
[03:02:31.563 --> 03:02:33.324]  My husband is Dr. Mark Barrett.
[03:02:33.786 --> 03:02:47.672]  He's a pediatrician in North Carolina, and we, well, we're Roman Catholics, so we, first of all, did not accept the shot because of the association with abortion.
[03:02:47.672 --> 03:02:51.914]  And then, secondly, well, Mark, do you want to say the rest?
[03:02:51.914 --> 03:02:53.595]  We gave it all up.
[03:02:53.595 --> 03:03:02.399]  He left his practice because he was giving full informed consent, meaning he was telling the patients the risks, and he would not recommend the shot.
[03:03:04.093 --> 03:03:15.296]  He left and we started two new practices and we're just doing it to save the kids and we owe a lot of it to you.
[03:03:15.296 --> 03:03:23.618]  I want to thank you because the answer is, while we still have some of the free market left, professionals starting their own thing and getting out of the system.
[03:03:23.618 --> 03:03:26.159]  That's beautiful.
[03:03:26.159 --> 03:03:27.880]  Well, thank you.
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:28.500]  We're doing it.
[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:29.820]  We're walking out on faith.
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:32.361]  We have no income right now, but he started
[03:03:33.427 --> 03:03:44.695]  Prepediatrics.com, and he also started a practice here in North Carolina called Hickory Pediatric Wellness.
[03:03:44.695 --> 03:03:47.977]  The charity serves Texas, North Carolina, and Florida.
[03:03:47.977 --> 03:03:50.178]  He's trying to get more licenses.
[03:03:50.178 --> 03:03:56.663]  Well, the answer is an exodus into good doctors and facilities that aren't part of this charity, because you're totally vindicated.
[03:03:56.663 --> 03:03:58.184]  I mean, you guys have been proven right.
[03:03:58.184 --> 03:03:59.945]  Look at how they admit this has been a disaster.
[03:04:01.946 --> 03:04:09.891]  It has been, and we just, you know, there comes a time, I told Mark, I said, you know, you cannot buy a clean conscience.
[03:04:09.891 --> 03:04:20.759]  And so we gave up his livelihood, and we're just trusting, and we just ask for your prayers, and for the prayers of the audience, that we can make it.
[03:04:20.759 --> 03:04:23.140]  And Mark, do you want to meet Alex?
[03:04:23.140 --> 03:04:23.961]  That'd be cool.
[03:04:23.961 --> 03:04:25.522]  I don't have relatives.
[03:04:26.837 --> 03:04:27.797]  Yeah, well come see us.
[03:04:27.797 --> 03:04:28.418]  Give us your number.
[03:04:28.418 --> 03:04:30.459]  We're going to put you on hold.
[03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:34.521]  Give the call person, we don't really screen calls, but we can get your calls.
[03:04:34.521 --> 03:04:36.882]  Have the person answer the calls, get your number, and we'll get you on as a guest.
[03:04:36.882 --> 03:04:38.082]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:38.082 --> 03:04:40.964]  Alright, I promise to finish up with calls.
[03:04:40.964 --> 03:04:46.887]  So, Penguin and Andrew, you're the final callers, and then Gerald Cilente's going to take over.
[03:04:46.887 --> 03:04:52.349]  But I want to ask Gerald Cilente, we'll skip the next network break, if we have the time back, about R. Lovecake Jr.
[03:04:52.349 --> 03:04:53.490]  This guy's sitting on all cylinders.
[03:04:53.490 --> 03:04:55.111]  That's who I actually support for president now.
[03:04:55.111 --> 03:04:55.571]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.910 --> 03:05:00.911]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[03:05:00.911 --> 03:05:05.691]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[03:05:05.691 --> 03:05:10.812]  InfoWars is known as being a game-changer, and our products are not any different.
[03:05:10.812 --> 03:05:17.394]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try, if you've never tried them, or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[03:05:17.394 --> 03:05:21.954]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:05:21.954 --> 03:05:25.115]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[03:05:25.555 --> 03:05:27.217]  You want to go research.
[03:05:27.217 --> 03:05:33.302]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[03:05:33.302 --> 03:05:34.683]  But they're selling out quick.
[03:05:34.683 --> 03:05:37.345]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[03:05:37.345 --> 03:05:40.588]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[03:05:40.588 --> 03:05:42.910]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[03:05:42.910 --> 03:05:43.731]  It's about to sell out.
[03:05:44.011 --> 03:05:51.734]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarstore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:05:51.734 --> 03:05:54.075]  Thank you for your support.
[03:05:54.075 --> 03:06:03.498]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.260 --> 03:06:19.280]  50,000!
[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:19.561]  50,000!
[03:06:19.561 --> 03:06:24.724]  Unstoppable rocks!
[03:06:24.724 --> 03:06:26.646]  All right.
[03:06:26.646 --> 03:06:32.189]  Gerald Celente, the great trend forecaster, great friend of mine, from Kingston, New York, is about to take over.
[03:06:32.189 --> 03:06:33.090]  I didn't get to this.
[03:06:33.090 --> 03:06:33.691]  I said I would.
[03:06:33.691 --> 03:06:34.971]  I'm gonna hit it.
[03:06:34.971 --> 03:06:36.913]  I told you two weeks ago it really happened with Tucker Carlson.
[03:06:36.913 --> 03:06:40.896]  I wasn't allowed to tell the whole story, but the Axios scoop is dead on, baby.
[03:06:41.630 --> 03:06:44.691]  I don't know why I'm told stuff I can't tell you, but I kind of hinted at it.
[03:06:44.691 --> 03:06:48.133]  I actually got griped a little bit, but the point is, is this is dead on.
[03:06:48.133 --> 03:06:49.433]  I'll tell you about that in a moment.
[03:06:49.433 --> 03:06:52.194]  But real quick, Penguin and Andrew finishing up.
[03:06:52.194 --> 03:06:54.135]  Penguin is in Pennsylvania.
[03:06:54.135 --> 03:06:54.895]  Andrew's in New York.
[03:06:54.895 --> 03:06:56.836]  Go ahead, Penguin.
[03:06:56.836 --> 03:06:57.036]  Yes.
[03:06:57.036 --> 03:06:58.237]  Hello, sir.
[03:06:58.237 --> 03:07:01.358]  I just wanted to date myself just real quick.
[03:07:01.358 --> 03:07:06.400]  I'm a Navy veteran and Ronald Reagan was my commander in chief.
[03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:09.321]  Beautiful.
[03:07:09.321 --> 03:07:10.922]  I have a couple questions for you real quick.
[03:07:11.812 --> 03:07:24.778]  I think the next bio attack is going to eliminate cash, and that's going to play into the whole CBDC, whatever you call it.
[03:07:24.778 --> 03:07:26.839]  You're not thinking that, it's true.
[03:07:26.839 --> 03:07:29.540]  They're pre-programming, cash is dirty, they're already trying to get rid of it everywhere.
[03:07:29.540 --> 03:07:30.881]  I think you're absolutely on target.
[03:07:31.934 --> 03:07:37.680]  I mean, my question is, what do you think that's going to do with crime, number one?
[03:07:37.680 --> 03:07:45.148]  It's going to make it explode, because I know so many hard-working people that have degrees, who have like two or three jobs, and one of the jobs is cash only.
[03:07:45.148 --> 03:07:48.612]  They couldn't even live a lower-middle-class lifestyle without the cash.
[03:07:50.774 --> 03:07:55.558]  He just hired 87,000 Biden-dead IRS agents to target blue-collar workers.
[03:07:55.558 --> 03:07:57.600]  I mean, there's not a nastier thing you could do.
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:00.903]  Because blue-collar workers don't even pay 7% of the taxes.
[03:08:00.903 --> 03:08:06.048]  So why would you target the lowest group paying taxes unless you wanted to ruin them?
[03:08:06.048 --> 03:08:06.368]  Right.
[03:08:06.368 --> 03:08:08.049]  Well, look at the underground economy.
[03:08:08.049 --> 03:08:09.551]  And let's just take drugs.
[03:08:09.551 --> 03:08:09.911]  OK?
[03:08:09.911 --> 03:08:11.032]  Illegal drugs.
[03:08:11.032 --> 03:08:13.134]  It's all cash.
[03:08:13.134 --> 03:08:15.496]  What are those people going to do?
[03:08:15.496 --> 03:08:17.578]  And number two, I mean,
[03:08:18.462 --> 03:08:22.405]  Do you think this might be a way that they're going to legalize everything?
[03:08:22.405 --> 03:08:25.607]  Because once you eliminate cash, you eliminate privacy.
[03:08:25.607 --> 03:08:28.309]  It's all meant to overturn society.
[03:08:28.309 --> 03:08:30.710]  I think you're asking me a question.
[03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:32.792]  I think you said the answer.
[03:08:32.792 --> 03:08:35.674]  I guess I wanted confirmation from him.
[03:08:35.674 --> 03:08:36.855]  Yeah, brother, you're dead on.
[03:08:36.855 --> 03:08:38.856]  And Gerald Celente is an expert on that.
[03:08:38.856 --> 03:08:42.278]  I'm sure he'll talk about the central bank digital currencies and the rest of it.
[03:08:42.278 --> 03:08:42.719]  Great points.
[03:08:42.719 --> 03:08:43.119]  Anything else?
[03:08:44.273 --> 03:08:53.437]  I just want to thank you for waking me up about 10 years ago when the whole Fukushima thing was going down, and I thank Obama because I was laid off and I had time to find you.
[03:08:53.437 --> 03:08:54.098]  Thank you so much.
[03:08:54.098 --> 03:08:55.298]  Brother, I appreciate you holding.
[03:08:55.298 --> 03:08:56.138]  We love you.
[03:08:56.138 --> 03:08:59.500]  I could talk to all these callers 30 minutes, but it's so frustrating.
[03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:02.821]  To get to the next caller, we've got to hang up on the last person.
[03:09:02.821 --> 03:09:05.082]  Andrew, and then we'll go to Gerald Cilente.
[03:09:05.082 --> 03:09:05.823]  Andrew, New York.
[03:09:05.823 --> 03:09:06.043]  Go ahead.
[03:09:07.662 --> 03:09:11.523]  Hello Alex, this is your sister Andrea from New York.
[03:09:11.523 --> 03:09:14.004]  I'm sorry, you know my eyes, I need to wear my glasses.
[03:09:14.004 --> 03:09:15.384]  Andrea, I apologize.
[03:09:15.384 --> 03:09:16.705]  Hey, you're transgender now.
[03:09:16.705 --> 03:09:25.027]  That is okay my brother, that is... It's okay my brother, it is your sister Andrea, biologically a woman, yeah.
[03:09:25.027 --> 03:09:26.867]  Yes ma'am.
[03:09:26.867 --> 03:09:30.088]  And I'm calling today Alex because you know what Alex?
[03:09:30.088 --> 03:09:32.269]  I'm always telling my family Alex that
[03:09:33.487 --> 03:09:41.693]  If we look at the movies that they have in the last 10, maybe 15 years been producing, they tell us everything for the movies.
[03:09:41.693 --> 03:09:47.297]  And the movies tell you what they've done, what they're doing, or what they're getting ready to do.
[03:09:47.297 --> 03:09:52.140]  And if we're not living... I never saw the movie The Purge, but I read the whole synopsis.
[03:09:52.140 --> 03:09:54.382]  If we're not living right now in The Purge,
[03:09:55.494 --> 03:09:55.995]  I don't know.
[03:09:55.995 --> 03:10:01.640]  Instead of one night of government sanction, it's one term of government sanction.
[03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:02.000]  Murder?
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:02.881]  I totally agree.
[03:10:02.881 --> 03:10:07.224]  They are bringing in lawlessness and the collapse of society, Cloward and Piven.
[03:10:07.224 --> 03:10:08.686]  It's called predictive programming.
[03:10:08.686 --> 03:10:17.033]  They're 100% doing it because they know if our subconscious mind is programmed to some horrible thing, we tend to go along with it because we've already been prepared for it.
[03:10:18.266 --> 03:10:21.827]  And we like to think that it's entertainment, but it is not entertainment.
[03:10:21.827 --> 03:10:24.127]  My mother always said, but they don't get it into a case.
[03:10:24.127 --> 03:10:25.828]  It entered you and it tainted you.
[03:10:25.828 --> 03:10:27.268]  Well, you just said it's so astute.
[03:10:27.268 --> 03:10:29.668]  You're so, you're smarter than, exactly.
[03:10:29.668 --> 03:10:33.729]  We sit there eating popcorn, watching horrible things and our brain sees it as a joke.
[03:10:33.729 --> 03:10:35.910]  So when the real thing happens, we're not threatened by it.
[03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:37.950]  You just bingo, bingo.
[03:10:37.950 --> 03:10:38.830]  You just nailed it.
[03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:41.271]  Give me some more knowledge, Andrea.
[03:10:41.271 --> 03:10:42.891]  It cracks me up because you know,
[03:10:43.592 --> 03:10:44.112]  I don't know.
[03:10:59.733 --> 03:11:01.814]  I mean, it is so programmed!
[03:11:01.814 --> 03:11:09.699]  With the 15-minute cities, you won't be able to escape and go any places, which is why they want our gas cars, which is why they want this.
[03:11:09.699 --> 03:11:14.602]  And I don't know if you ever saw this movie called End Time with Justin Timberlake.
[03:11:14.602 --> 03:11:19.245]  It cracked me up when they began a war on our CO2, saying we emit too much CO2.
[03:11:19.245 --> 03:11:21.966]  We already know you want to kill us, so now you don't want us breathing.
[03:11:21.966 --> 03:11:26.669]  But in that movie, that movie was crazy, Alex, because in the movie,
[03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:36.915]  It's like, okay, you're born, and it's like they give you 21 years worth of free air, and after that, you can only have extra air if you can afford it.
[03:11:36.915 --> 03:11:43.200]  Now, I don't know if you remember when China was selling fresh air because they smogged up all of their, you know, their residents and they were killing them.
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:48.423]  That's like Spaceballs, and Spaceballs are selling canned air.
[03:11:48.423 --> 03:11:50.845]  You're beautiful, amazing points, Andrea.
[03:11:50.845 --> 03:11:51.905]  Sorry, I got your name wrong.
[03:11:51.905 --> 03:11:53.046]  Thank you from New York.
[03:11:53.046 --> 03:11:56.749]  Speaking of New York, Gerald Slim is about to take over, and I'm going to introduce him here in a moment, but first,
[03:11:57.689 --> 03:11:58.649]  I'll talk more about this tomorrow.
[03:11:58.649 --> 03:12:00.230]  It's bigger than Tucker Carlson.
[03:12:00.230 --> 03:12:02.471]  It's bigger than Alex Jones or Gil Celente.
[03:12:02.471 --> 03:12:05.331]  Tucker was number one, reaching way more than they said he was.
[03:12:05.331 --> 03:12:06.372]  He was fully awake.
[03:12:06.372 --> 03:12:08.652]  I'm friends with him, believe me, I know.
[03:12:08.652 --> 03:12:11.273]  And they canned him two weeks ago.
[03:12:11.273 --> 03:12:13.254]  Well, Little Bird told me what was going to happen.
[03:12:13.254 --> 03:12:15.594]  Tucker's going to set up his own network.
[03:12:15.594 --> 03:12:18.615]  Elon Musk is coming around saying he wants to help.
[03:12:18.615 --> 03:12:21.156]  Fox is going to try to block his contract.
[03:12:21.156 --> 03:12:22.857]  They were already mad at Tucker on a host of issues.
[03:12:22.857 --> 03:12:23.877]  He thought he was about to be fired.
[03:12:23.877 --> 03:12:24.797]  He already knew.
[03:12:24.797 --> 03:12:25.678]  That's all come out.
[03:12:25.678 --> 03:12:26.958]  Axios actually got the scoop.
[03:12:28.607 --> 03:12:29.528]  I kind of foreshadowed it.
[03:12:29.528 --> 03:12:32.451]  I was told all this but wasn't allowed to tell you until it happened.
[03:12:32.451 --> 03:12:32.931]  But scoop!
[03:12:32.931 --> 03:12:36.895]  Tucker Carlson ready to torch Fox News.
[03:12:36.895 --> 03:12:43.341]  Tucker Carlson's lawyer urges Fox News to permit Carlson to get a new job because his contract isn't up until January 2025, a year
[03:12:47.059 --> 03:12:49.121]  And I have plus from now.
[03:12:49.121 --> 03:12:50.702]  So that's a big deal.
[03:12:50.702 --> 03:12:52.043]  But this is a very accurate story.
[03:12:52.043 --> 03:12:53.844]  I can tell you it is dead on.
[03:12:53.844 --> 03:12:55.546]  Meanwhile, I'm with Tucker.
[03:12:55.546 --> 03:12:59.068]  NFL legend Brett Favre calls for Fox News boycott.
[03:12:59.068 --> 03:13:01.090]  They lost more than half their audience.
[03:13:01.090 --> 03:13:03.051]  Showing freedom is popular.
[03:13:03.051 --> 03:13:05.553]  If we can stop censorship, we will win together.
[03:13:05.553 --> 03:13:07.695]  Now, speaking of escape from New York, let's roll it.
[03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:17.711]  Gerald Solente has escaped from New York to Kingston, the birthplace of the Republic, and he's fighting harder than ever.
[03:13:17.711 --> 03:13:18.651]  And he's going to cover it all.
[03:13:18.651 --> 03:13:19.652]  I want to ask about R.F.K.
[03:13:19.652 --> 03:13:20.332]  Jr.
[03:13:20.332 --> 03:13:29.834]  coming out saying the carbon tax is a fraud, saying we've got to control the border, saying the New World Order killed his father and his uncle, and saying that he's going to restore the Republic.
[03:13:29.834 --> 03:13:31.874]  I've got to say he's the best candidate right now.
[03:13:31.874 --> 03:13:37.296]  So, the great Gerald Solente, the top trends forecaster in the next 46 minutes,
[03:13:38.676 --> 03:13:40.277]  Thank you Alex, very kind of you.
[03:13:40.277 --> 03:13:47.379]  You know, you go back to InfoWars, and I think it was December 19th, I said that the top candidate for president would be RFK Jr.
[03:13:47.379 --> 03:13:50.080]  It's right there, video's there, and I was on with Alex.
[03:14:05.797 --> 03:14:10.618]  We did our top trends for 2023 back in January.
[03:14:10.618 --> 03:14:12.919]  And what did I say?
[03:14:12.919 --> 03:14:14.859]  RFK.
[03:14:14.859 --> 03:14:16.760]  RFK.
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:24.741]  RFK, as things are going now, can be the next president of the United States.
[03:14:24.741 --> 03:14:35.144]  And as Alex knows, in the Trends Journal back in May of 2016, when all the polls showed that Trump wasn't going to win,
[03:14:36.121 --> 03:14:39.725]  We said he was going to win.
[03:14:39.725 --> 03:14:43.728]  RFK is not a long shot.
[03:14:43.728 --> 03:14:46.791]  He's got a great shot.
[03:14:46.791 --> 03:14:52.437]  And when you look at his numbers, when he announced, they were 14%.
[03:14:52.437 --> 03:14:55.120]  Now they're up to 20%.
[03:14:55.120 --> 03:14:57.262]  That's really high.
[03:14:57.262 --> 03:15:00.385]  So you look at the numbers, again, only by the numbers.
[03:15:01.184 --> 03:15:08.526]  The new poll that came out, Biden's approval rating stands at 36% down from 42%.
[03:15:08.526 --> 03:15:12.087]  And then you look at the people.
[03:15:12.087 --> 03:15:28.771]  Biden's approval rating among a slew of groups that supported him by wide margins in 2020, he stands at 26% approval among Americans under, between the ages of 30, under the age of 30.
[03:15:30.908 --> 03:15:41.878]  This is important because it was the young people that went out to vote, like it or not, agree or disagree with the issue because of Roe versus Wade.
[03:15:41.878 --> 03:15:45.621]  And that's why the Republicans didn't do so great.
[03:15:45.621 --> 03:15:51.686]  So the young people don't like Trump and they're going to go for RFK Jr.
[03:15:51.686 --> 03:15:54.268]  We're going to be going on to this.
[03:15:54.268 --> 03:15:58.392]  We're not going to stop because this is big.
[03:15:59.727 --> 03:16:05.192]  And again, I'm not bragging, but the facts are there.
[03:16:05.192 --> 03:16:08.174]  I'm the first guy that called it.
[03:16:08.174 --> 03:16:10.196]  And the ticket was RFK Jr.
[03:16:10.196 --> 03:16:17.462]  for President and Judge Andrew Napolitano for Vice President.
[03:16:17.462 --> 03:16:24.228]  And we're having a Peace and Freedom Rally up here in Kingston, New York on May 27th.
[03:16:24.228 --> 03:16:27.771]  And we're going to doing our very best to get RFK Jr.
[03:16:27.771 --> 03:16:27.991]  here.
[03:16:30.663 --> 03:16:36.366]  Whether live here or live on screen.
[03:16:36.366 --> 03:16:40.429]  Because we are on the same page.
[03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:51.095]  And again, you go by the numbers, and where Biden is now, where Kennedy is now, at that number, 20%, that's a high.
[03:16:51.095 --> 03:16:51.155]  And
[03:16:56.505 --> 03:17:04.551]  The COVID war is ended, so hitting him with the anti-vaccine stuff isn't going to hurt him much.
[03:17:04.551 --> 03:17:08.273]  Look, they make up this crap.
[03:17:08.273 --> 03:17:18.260]  On May 11th, they're going to officially declare in the United States that the COVID war is over.
[03:17:18.260 --> 03:17:21.322]  No more state of emergency.
[03:17:21.322 --> 03:17:22.543]  And then what do you just have?
[03:17:22.543 --> 03:17:25.585]  The other freak organization.
[03:17:27.608 --> 03:17:28.648]  Who?
[03:17:28.648 --> 03:17:30.009]  Yeah, who are they?
[03:17:30.009 --> 03:17:38.872]  A bunch of low-life, arrogant, slimy, little bureau, ignorant craps.
[03:17:38.872 --> 03:17:47.255]  Who declares COVID-19 pandemic is over after three years and 20 million deaths?
[03:17:47.255 --> 03:17:48.336]  You got it?
[03:17:48.336 --> 03:17:53.478]  Financial Times.
[03:17:53.478 --> 03:17:55.699]  No, no.
[03:17:55.699 --> 03:17:56.279]  Google it up.
[03:17:57.283 --> 03:17:59.064]  6,870,704 6,870,704 deaths.
[03:17:59.064 --> 03:18:01.546]  Not 20 million.
[03:18:01.546 --> 03:18:08.071]  Oh, but who said 20 million?
[03:18:08.071 --> 03:18:17.437]  That little sloppy looking jerk who's the head of who that looks like he's in the worst damn health that a clown could look in.
[03:18:17.437 --> 03:18:21.520]  That's who said 20 million.
[03:18:21.520 --> 03:18:21.660]  Yep.
[03:18:25.066 --> 03:18:30.708]  But the numbers are... The global outbreak has killed nearly 7 million.
[03:18:30.708 --> 03:18:34.669]  Both numbers are believed to be significant underestimates.
[03:18:34.669 --> 03:18:39.030]  Tedarros said the true figure was higher.
[03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:41.011]  Probably at least 20 million.
[03:18:41.011 --> 03:18:42.991]  Oh, Tedarros said?
[03:18:42.991 --> 03:18:46.272]  How about what Mickey Mouse said?
[03:18:46.272 --> 03:18:48.273]  How about what Goofy said?
[03:18:48.273 --> 03:18:49.453]  Hey.
[03:18:53.885 --> 03:19:03.753]  How about the truth?
[03:19:03.753 --> 03:19:05.915]  So going back to- Look at this guy!
[03:19:05.915 --> 03:19:08.257]  Look at this jerk!
[03:19:08.257 --> 03:19:11.239]  Telling me about health!
[03:19:11.239 --> 03:19:16.924]  How about go- I can't say it because I don't want to get blacklisted.
[03:19:16.924 --> 03:19:17.404]  Oh!
[03:19:17.404 --> 03:19:18.145]  I shouldn't have said that.
[03:19:18.145 --> 03:19:19.346]  His color's dark.
[03:19:19.346 --> 03:19:21.828]  I didn't mean it blacklisted like that!
[03:19:25.896 --> 03:19:30.397]  You look at the numbers.
[03:19:30.397 --> 03:19:33.958]  I gave you them.
[03:19:33.958 --> 03:19:43.960]  At 8 billion people, 0.09% of the world's population died of COVID.
[03:19:43.960 --> 03:19:49.741]  Allegedly, they had pre-existing comorbidities, which means that only, only
[03:19:55.077 --> 03:19:59.919]  99.91% of the people are still alive.
[03:19:59.919 --> 03:20:03.821]  But they wish they were dead, a lot of them.
[03:20:03.821 --> 03:20:10.645]  Because they destroyed their businesses.
[03:20:10.645 --> 03:20:12.046]  Yep.
[03:20:12.046 --> 03:20:15.048]  That's where we're at.
[03:20:15.048 --> 03:20:19.530]  A freak show of the First Order.
[03:20:19.530 --> 03:20:20.391]  And that's why
[03:20:22.921 --> 03:20:26.624]  They're gonna try to hit Kennedy with the anti-vax stuff.
[03:20:26.624 --> 03:20:28.645]  It's over.
[03:20:28.645 --> 03:20:30.427]  It's over.
[03:20:30.427 --> 03:20:33.970]  It ain't gonna work.
[03:20:33.970 --> 03:20:47.020]  So to me, if I would be able to bet, if they get any of those betting things online, I would bet for RFK Jr.
[03:20:47.020 --> 03:20:50.862]  Because this is the cat that's gonna win.
[03:20:50.862 --> 03:20:52.524]  And you look at the stuff that he says.
[03:20:57.239 --> 03:20:59.600]  Kennedy shares opinion on key U.S.
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:00.720]  mistakes with Russia.
[03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:05.041]  Quote, we should have listened to Putin over many years.
[03:21:05.041 --> 03:21:10.343]  We made a commitment to Russia to Gorbachev that we would not move NATO one inch east.
[03:21:10.343 --> 03:21:11.563]  Yep.
[03:21:11.563 --> 03:21:18.585]  Oh, and then he talks about what happened in Kiev in 2014, essentially a coup d'etat.
[03:21:20.180 --> 03:21:23.803]  Supported by the U.S.
[03:21:23.803 --> 03:21:32.891]  recalling the phone call which Victoria Nuland was, quote, handpicking a new cabinet hostile to Moscow.
[03:21:32.891 --> 03:21:47.623]  He said if Mexico did that and then started killing, and he goes on, the Russians killed 14,000 people in Donbass, Ukrainian government, if Mexico did that to expatriate Americans, we'd invade the second.
[03:21:47.623 --> 03:21:47.823]  Yeah.
[03:21:50.646 --> 03:21:56.331]  Kennedy must be reading the Trends Journal.
[03:21:56.331 --> 03:21:57.692]  This is from 2014.
[03:21:57.692 --> 03:22:10.342]  Article written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan.
[03:22:10.342 --> 03:22:19.169]  Ukraine presented the perfect opportunity for Washington to advance its hegemonic agenda in a speech to the National Press Club
[03:22:19.645 --> 03:22:26.330]  Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland boasted, oh that Victoria Nuland, yeah?
[03:22:26.330 --> 03:22:33.735]  Boasted that the United States invested five billion dollars in NGOs, non-governmental organizations, you ready?
[03:22:33.735 --> 03:22:39.799]  To teach democracy to Ukraine.
[03:22:39.799 --> 03:22:42.721]  He is on the exact same page in so many ways.
[03:22:44.970 --> 03:22:45.971]  RFK Jr.
[03:22:45.971 --> 03:22:56.035]  Bill Gates and World Economic Forum are using climate change to control population.
[03:22:56.035 --> 03:23:03.178]  Yep.
[03:23:03.178 --> 03:23:04.999]  Yep.
[03:23:04.999 --> 03:23:08.841]  Climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by, you know,
[03:23:09.798 --> 03:23:18.667]  The World Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all these big, you know, mega billionaires, Kennedy told Iverson.
[03:23:18.667 --> 03:23:22.351]  Kim Iverson.
[03:23:22.351 --> 03:23:28.777]  So the people that don't like it for climate change, you can't agree with everybody on everything.
[03:23:28.777 --> 03:23:30.959]  We're human beings.
[03:23:30.959 --> 03:23:32.621]  But you have to look at the bigger issues.
[03:23:36.607 --> 03:23:40.150]  Presidential candidate vows to unwind U.S.
[03:23:40.150 --> 03:23:41.611]  empire.
[03:23:41.611 --> 03:23:42.891]  Quote, Ms.
[03:23:42.891 --> 03:23:45.793]  Kennedy, we will bring the troops home.
[03:23:45.793 --> 03:23:52.798]  We'll stop racking up unpayable debt to fight one war after another.
[03:23:52.798 --> 03:23:57.982]  The military will return to its proper role defending our country.
[03:23:57.982 --> 03:24:04.987]  Those are almost word for word the mandates of
[03:24:05.845 --> 03:24:08.687]  Our Occupy Peace Movement.
[03:24:08.687 --> 03:24:12.750]  OccupyPeace.com.
[03:24:12.750 --> 03:24:16.472]  Bring home the troops.
[03:24:16.472 --> 03:24:20.255]  From those what?
[03:24:20.255 --> 03:24:25.699]  800 something military bases in over 70, almost 80 countries?
[03:24:25.699 --> 03:24:28.220]  Secure the homeland.
[03:24:28.220 --> 03:24:30.422]  Says it right here.
[03:24:30.422 --> 03:24:33.264]  The military returned to his proper role defending our country.
[03:24:36.491 --> 03:24:42.852]  And we say put the troops to work to rebuild our third world infrastructure.
[03:24:42.852 --> 03:24:51.174]  And you want to send my money to a foreign country for war or anything else?
[03:24:51.174 --> 03:24:54.295]  Let the people vote.
[03:24:54.295 --> 03:24:56.556]  It's my money.
[03:24:56.556 --> 03:24:58.736]  You're a public servant.
[03:24:58.736 --> 03:25:03.017]  Actually, you're political pieces of crap.
[03:25:04.023 --> 03:25:05.684]  I'm Chucky Schumer!
[03:25:05.684 --> 03:25:08.205]  I'm Lindsey Graham!
[03:25:08.205 --> 03:25:10.005]  I'm Mitch McConnell!
[03:25:10.005 --> 03:25:14.567]  I'm Dianne Not-So-Feinstein!
[03:25:14.567 --> 03:25:18.308]  Let the p- it's our money!
[03:25:18.308 --> 03:25:32.513]  So Kennedy said, quote, I'm in a better position to run against Donald Trump than any of the Democrats because I can hold him accountable for the worst thing that he did
[03:25:33.348 --> 03:25:35.969]  Which was the lockdowns.
[03:25:35.969 --> 03:25:41.950]  Again, love Trump, hate Trump, not the issue, only the facts.
[03:25:41.950 --> 03:25:46.991]  And it was Friday the 13th in March, 2020, when he announced the state of emergency.
[03:25:46.991 --> 03:25:48.331]  Black Friday.
[03:25:48.331 --> 03:25:51.932]  Shouldn't say Black Friday.
[03:25:51.932 --> 03:25:54.072]  Black Ball.
[03:25:54.072 --> 03:25:55.633]  Yeah.
[03:25:55.633 --> 03:25:57.373]  Misinformation.
[03:25:57.373 --> 03:25:59.554]  Let's really be stupid about everything.
[03:25:59.554 --> 03:26:01.154]  Because that's where America is today.
[03:26:02.099 --> 03:26:15.691]  To show you the stupidity and arrogance, when he announced, this is what the New York Times wrote when Kennedy announced, announcing his long shot bid to challenge President Biden.
[03:26:15.691 --> 03:26:16.612]  Long shot bid?
[03:26:20.540 --> 03:26:24.542]  Hey clowns, ain't a long shot bid, but they go on.
[03:26:24.542 --> 03:26:39.348]  Mr. Kennedy, a California resident, traveled to Boston, once a citadel of his family's power, to declare that he would challenge President Biden for the Democratic nomination in a long shot bid for the White House.
[03:26:39.348 --> 03:26:46.752]  So speaking of stupidity, it's the American media.
[03:26:46.752 --> 03:26:49.433]  Little moronic boys and girls in charge.
[03:26:50.450 --> 03:26:55.033]  As I said, I used to be on with Tucker Carlson years ago.
[03:26:55.033 --> 03:27:00.597]  You know, again, it's not whether you like Tucker Carlson to me or dislike him.
[03:27:00.597 --> 03:27:04.620]  I think he does a great job.
[03:27:04.620 --> 03:27:10.564]  The bigger issue is, this is big news.
[03:27:10.564 --> 03:27:13.606]  This is big news.
[03:27:13.606 --> 03:27:15.327]  Why?
[03:27:15.327 --> 03:27:18.349]  One person, one person,
[03:27:20.217 --> 03:27:23.058]  Is outside the club.
[03:27:23.058 --> 03:27:25.019]  Yep.
[03:27:25.019 --> 03:27:40.743]  One person at a 99.9999999% is not repeating the same crap spewing out of the prostitutes mouths and it's big news.
[03:27:40.743 --> 03:27:42.684]  Again, like them or dislike them.
[03:27:42.684 --> 03:27:48.586]  The fact is one person outside the club and they attack you.
[03:27:49.417 --> 03:27:57.021]  Like they attack Alex Jones, like they attack me.
[03:27:57.021 --> 03:28:04.144]  So, that's why you support InfoWars.
[03:28:04.144 --> 03:28:12.728]  Because one guy gets thrown out, giving him high ratings, and he's gone.
[03:28:12.728 --> 03:28:15.590]  They don't want freedom.
[03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:17.871]  They don't want life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness.
[03:28:20.396 --> 03:28:24.299]  The COVID wars, the damage is incalculable.
[03:28:24.299 --> 03:28:25.740]  It sucked the joy out of life.
[03:28:25.740 --> 03:28:30.323]  It's destroying lives and livelihoods around the world.
[03:28:30.323 --> 03:28:35.967]  So support InfoWars because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[03:28:35.967 --> 03:28:40.591]  And put your money where your mouth is and your heart is and your mind is.
[03:28:40.591 --> 03:28:42.752]  Stop being so cheap.
[03:28:42.752 --> 03:28:46.975]  Buy what you need for yourself and for InfoWars.
[03:28:46.975 --> 03:28:48.877]  So we're going to take a break.
[03:28:49.907 --> 03:28:51.628]  Talk a lot more about the economy.
[03:28:51.628 --> 03:28:57.471]  Much better.
[03:28:57.471 --> 03:29:04.394]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:29:04.394 --> 03:29:13.378]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:29:13.378 --> 03:29:15.579]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:29:16.199 --> 03:29:19.500]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:29:19.500 --> 03:29:28.023]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:29:28.023 --> 03:29:37.866]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:29:38.446 --> 03:29:44.369]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:29:44.369 --> 03:29:50.431]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[03:31:56.618 --> 03:32:02.924]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[03:32:02.924 --> 03:32:05.907]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:32:05.907 --> 03:32:15.456]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:32:15.456 --> 03:32:17.397]  The number one preventable cause
[03:32:18.118 --> 03:32:29.001]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[03:32:29.001 --> 03:32:38.944]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:32:38.944 --> 03:32:41.305]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[03:32:41.305 --> 03:32:44.366]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[03:32:45.066 --> 03:32:45.727]  We're good to go.
[03:33:17.536 --> 03:33:21.996]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.996 --> 03:33:33.558]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:33.558 --> 03:33:35.959]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.959 --> 03:33:39.479]  Look, what you're getting on Alex Jones, Infowars, you're not getting anywhere else.
[03:33:39.479 --> 03:33:43.440]  The variety of what they have, the people they have on, like myself and others,
[03:33:44.518 --> 03:33:47.060]  And, you know, what's it costing you?
[03:33:47.060 --> 03:33:50.263]  So, again, put your money where your heart and your mind and your soul are.
[03:33:50.263 --> 03:33:57.008]  Support InfoWars because, to get this straight, we're in the fight for our lives.
[03:33:57.008 --> 03:33:59.210]  And that's no joke.
[03:33:59.210 --> 03:34:05.355]  Because, you know, one of my sayings is, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:34:05.355 --> 03:34:07.537]  What followed the Great Depression?
[03:34:07.537 --> 03:34:10.339]  World War II.
[03:34:10.339 --> 03:34:12.061]  What followed the dot-com bust?
[03:34:15.313 --> 03:34:17.935]  War on Terror.
[03:34:17.935 --> 03:34:26.441]  And we are in the most critical socio-economic and geopolitical times in my lifetime.
[03:34:26.441 --> 03:34:30.584]  And I'm 76 years old.
[03:34:30.584 --> 03:34:32.966]  This is critical.
[03:34:32.966 --> 03:34:35.948]  And if we don't unite, we're finished.
[03:34:35.948 --> 03:34:36.949]  Done.
[03:34:36.949 --> 03:34:37.149]  Done.
[03:34:37.952 --> 03:34:48.677]  But remember, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, said Samuel Adams.
[03:34:48.677 --> 03:34:53.239]  So we're that irate, tireless minority and we have to unite.
[03:34:53.239 --> 03:35:06.925]  So, and going on about, as I was talking before about RFK Jr., the people are tired of both Trump and Biden.
[03:35:07.403 --> 03:35:09.404]  And again, a poll?
[03:35:09.404 --> 03:35:16.087]  Two-thirds of Americans want nothing to do with either.
[03:35:16.087 --> 03:35:21.710]  Again, you go to InfoWars because you're getting what you're not getting anywhere else.
[03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:29.954]  And here's one of the things you got on, it was in December, when I said RFK Jr.
[03:35:29.954 --> 03:35:31.074]  for President.
[03:35:31.074 --> 03:35:34.316]  And then the other one is when I'm on with Alex Jones.
[03:35:34.316 --> 03:35:35.456]  So the facts are right here.
[03:35:35.456 --> 03:35:36.717]  So let's see them.
[03:35:41.889 --> 03:35:44.490]  You got those videos?
[03:35:44.490 --> 03:35:51.932]  The President of the United States!
[03:35:51.932 --> 03:35:53.752]  R.F.K.
[03:35:53.752 --> 03:35:55.413]  Jr.
[03:35:55.413 --> 03:35:58.373]  Put on the ticket R.F.K.
[03:35:58.373 --> 03:35:58.614]  Jr.
[03:35:58.614 --> 03:36:03.855]  for President and Judge Andrew Napolitano for Vice President.
[03:36:03.855 --> 03:36:09.156]  And I'm saying the Libertarian Party because they have ballots in all of the states and it's very obvious.
[03:36:09.156 --> 03:36:11.017]  The only other party in all 50 states.
[03:36:12.051 --> 03:36:13.171]  Right.
[03:36:13.171 --> 03:36:27.016]  And so to put these two people on a new... And they could inject the anti-war, pro-peace, anti-nuclear war, anti-Armageddon ideas into the debates.
[03:36:27.016 --> 03:36:32.997]  They could force their way in and put that on the referendum in the next election or even sooner.
[03:36:32.997 --> 03:36:34.478]  They could hit the campaign trail now.
[03:36:36.266 --> 03:36:36.947]  What do you think?
[03:36:36.947 --> 03:36:37.407]  Here we go.
[03:36:37.407 --> 03:36:38.628]  Would that be a winning ticket?
[03:36:38.628 --> 03:36:40.789]  I think it's an absolutely genius move.
[03:36:40.789 --> 03:36:42.970]  And I think they should do it now to stop nuclear war.
[03:36:42.970 --> 03:36:44.311]  And they would not be ignored.
[03:36:44.311 --> 03:36:45.272]  It would galvanize people.
[03:36:45.272 --> 03:36:48.734]  We could get huge anti-war demonstrations going again.
[03:36:48.734 --> 03:36:50.375]  And I think it would unify the left and right.
[03:36:50.375 --> 03:36:54.318]  And it's something we need to do right now.
[03:36:54.318 --> 03:36:55.899]  Look at that.
[03:36:55.899 --> 03:36:57.220]  Right?
[03:36:57.220 --> 03:37:01.523]  Alex, they were both, both of us saying it right there.
[03:37:01.523 --> 03:37:03.184]  Big anti-war rallies.
[03:37:05.223 --> 03:37:13.907]  And we're having one up here in Kingston, New York, on the Four Corners of Freedom, John and Crown Street, starting at 1 p.m.
[03:37:13.907 --> 03:37:20.209]  on May 27th, Memorial Day weekend, in celebration of our founding father.
[03:37:20.209 --> 03:37:26.632]  So see what you can do to get here, and you go to OccupyPeace, OccupyPeace.com, for more information.
[03:37:26.632 --> 03:37:27.813]  All right.
[03:37:27.813 --> 03:37:33.635]  Now I want to talk more about what's going on in the economy.
[03:37:34.107 --> 03:37:39.692]  This is very serious.
[03:37:39.692 --> 03:37:45.516]  The banking crisis has just begun.
[03:37:45.516 --> 03:37:54.164]  What they're barely talking about in any of the media, it just comes out from time to time, is the office building bust.
[03:37:54.164 --> 03:37:56.886]  And this thing's busting big.
[03:37:56.886 --> 03:38:02.390]  The office occupancy rate in the United States is 49
[03:38:05.233 --> 03:38:06.874]  0.6% according to Castle Systems.
[03:38:06.874 --> 03:38:15.121]  That's with a K. Your office vacancy rates means that the offices are empty.
[03:38:15.121 --> 03:38:17.642]  It's not like they rented and people going back and forth.
[03:38:17.642 --> 03:38:19.964]  They're vacant.
[03:38:19.964 --> 03:38:20.605]  In LA, 30%.
[03:38:20.605 --> 03:38:22.066]  A third?
[03:38:22.066 --> 03:38:22.946]  In San Francisco, almost 30%.
[03:38:33.197 --> 03:38:47.961]  And these are not convertible into housing, so don't listen to the little prostitutes, because according to the data, buildings built within the last 50 years are non-convertible to apartments.
[03:38:47.961 --> 03:38:51.822]  Look at these ugly things of steel and glass.
[03:38:51.822 --> 03:38:58.964]  You look at the old buildings, they had small rooms with these things called windows, yeah, that used to go up and down.
[03:38:58.964 --> 03:39:01.025]  These things are just one big space
[03:39:01.992 --> 03:39:05.915]  And built, you know, totally different.
[03:39:05.915 --> 03:39:16.682]  So when you look at the data on this, it's really, really going to hit hard.
[03:39:16.682 --> 03:39:21.104]  They're coming out in Canada, they're worried about it as well.
[03:39:21.104 --> 03:39:26.348]  Canadian bank earnings at risk from office real estate exposure.
[03:39:26.348 --> 03:39:29.610]  Isn't that nice language?
[03:39:30.538 --> 03:39:34.340]  Office real estate exposure.
[03:39:34.340 --> 03:39:36.562]  You're exposing yourself.
[03:39:36.562 --> 03:39:43.006]  Don't use the word exposure.
[03:39:43.006 --> 03:39:50.270]  Commercial real estate loans represent the second largest lending exposure of Canada's sixth largest banks.
[03:39:50.270 --> 03:39:51.271]  So this is global.
[03:39:51.271 --> 03:40:00.016]  According to Goldman Sachs, commercial real estate loans in the banking system
[03:40:00.535 --> 03:40:03.156]  On the balance sheets, U.S.
[03:40:03.156 --> 03:40:12.980]  regional banks with between $10 billion and $20 billion in assets have 25% of the loans.
[03:40:12.980 --> 03:40:17.883]  And banks with less than $180 billion in assets hold around 70%.
[03:40:17.883 --> 03:40:25.286]  So that means they don't have a lot of backdrop there when they start defaulting on the loans.
[03:40:28.999 --> 03:40:31.240]  This is so big.
[03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:34.481]  And again, it doesn't make the news.
[03:40:34.481 --> 03:40:38.003]  The prostitutes don't talk about it.
[03:40:38.003 --> 03:40:41.144]  They have other things to do, but they have a story here.
[03:40:41.144 --> 03:40:44.465]  You ready?
[03:40:44.465 --> 03:40:48.387]  The Toilet Paper Record, the New York Times, Sunday.
[03:40:48.387 --> 03:40:52.368]  You know what it's on?
[03:40:52.368 --> 03:40:53.769]  Page 827.
[03:40:53.769 --> 03:40:54.889]  Buried.
[03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:56.530]  Available for lease in Manhattan.
[03:40:57.924 --> 03:41:03.207]  A record 94 million square feet of office space.
[03:41:03.207 --> 03:41:11.651]  Yep.
[03:41:11.651 --> 03:41:12.112]  You got it.
[03:41:12.112 --> 03:41:22.537]  According to Colliers, the group said that the total square footage of office space in Manhattan for lease is roughly 94 million.
[03:41:22.537 --> 03:41:23.198]  It's a record.
[03:41:28.973 --> 03:41:33.315]  The vacancy rate, 17.4%.
[03:41:33.315 --> 03:41:40.919]  Again, I said it's 30% in L.A.
[03:41:40.919 --> 03:41:43.440]  and almost 30% in San Francisco.
[03:41:43.440 --> 03:41:47.562]  And it's getting toward 20% in New York.
[03:41:47.562 --> 03:41:54.386]  And now, by the way, those little politicians, you know those little jerks that never work a day in their life?
[03:41:54.386 --> 03:41:57.067]  Those slimy little slime balls?
[03:41:57.067 --> 03:41:58.508]  They need tax dollars.
[03:41:59.793 --> 03:42:02.555]  And guess what?
[03:42:02.555 --> 03:42:07.059]  Commercial buildings pay a lot in taxes that they're not going to be paying.
[03:42:07.059 --> 03:42:08.420]  Now this thing's big.
[03:42:08.420 --> 03:42:14.405]  The implications are broad, wide, and deep.
[03:42:14.405 --> 03:42:20.190]  What are going to be the implications?
[03:42:20.190 --> 03:42:28.457]  You're going to start seeing foreclosures and bank fail.
[03:42:30.646 --> 03:42:31.327]  Just begun.
[03:42:31.327 --> 03:42:36.331]  The bank failures have just begun.
[03:42:36.331 --> 03:42:37.472]  So what do you do?
[03:42:37.472 --> 03:42:40.155]  Where do you put your money?
[03:42:40.155 --> 03:42:49.984]  I don't give financial advice, but I'll tell you what we see, where it's going, and the motto of the Trends Journal magazine is, think for yourself.
[03:42:49.984 --> 03:42:53.728]  So when we get back, you can think for yourself, because we're going to have a lot to say.
[03:42:57.312 --> 03:42:59.894]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:42:59.894 --> 03:43:02.155]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[03:43:02.155 --> 03:43:04.156]  It will change your life.
[03:43:04.156 --> 03:43:12.902]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:43:12.902 --> 03:43:18.226]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[03:43:18.226 --> 03:43:19.707]  Most iodine in the environment
[03:43:20.407 --> 03:43:23.948]  ...is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[03:43:23.948 --> 03:43:28.410]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[03:43:28.410 --> 03:43:35.492]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[03:43:35.492 --> 03:43:41.494]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[03:43:42.054 --> 03:43:44.415]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:43:44.415 --> 03:43:46.676]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[03:43:46.676 --> 03:43:48.476]  You and your family need it.
[03:43:48.476 --> 03:43:50.237]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[03:43:50.237 --> 03:43:54.438]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[03:43:54.438 --> 03:43:57.059]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[03:43:57.059 --> 03:44:00.560]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:44:05.336 --> 03:44:06.677]  I want you all to know something.
[03:44:06.677 --> 03:44:08.638]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:44:08.638 --> 03:44:12.200]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:15.302]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:44:15.302 --> 03:44:19.564]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:44:19.564 --> 03:44:21.105]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:44:21.765 --> 03:44:25.287]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:44:25.287 --> 03:44:29.030]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:31.892]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:44:31.892 --> 03:44:32.912]  Years ago.
[03:44:32.912 --> 03:44:35.014]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:44:35.014 --> 03:44:36.995]  Not for a second.
[03:44:36.995 --> 03:44:39.516]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:44:39.516 --> 03:44:41.978]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:44:41.978 --> 03:44:45.120]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:46.681]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:44:46.681 --> 03:44:49.763]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:44:57.168 --> 03:45:03.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[03:45:03.475 --> 03:45:06.438]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:45:06.438 --> 03:45:12.784]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[03:45:13.425 --> 03:45:15.966]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:45:15.966 --> 03:45:28.872]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, fluorine and so much more.
[03:45:29.532 --> 03:45:39.480]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:45:39.480 --> 03:45:41.841]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[03:45:41.841 --> 03:45:47.526]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:45:47.526 --> 03:45:50.208]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:50.208 --> 03:45:53.550]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:45:53.550 --> 03:45:54.851]  X3, back in stock.
[03:45:54.851 --> 03:45:55.912]  Take action now.
[03:45:55.912 --> 03:45:56.873]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:57.393 --> 03:46:00.415]  InfoWars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[03:46:00.415 --> 03:46:05.197]  InfoWars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[03:46:05.197 --> 03:46:10.299]  InfoWars is known as being a game changer, and our products are not any different.
[03:46:10.299 --> 03:46:16.882]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try, if you've never tried them, or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[03:46:16.882 --> 03:46:21.444]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:46:21.444 --> 03:46:24.606]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[03:46:25.046 --> 03:46:26.687]  You want to go research.
[03:46:26.687 --> 03:46:32.791]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock.
[03:46:32.791 --> 03:46:34.172]  But they're selling out quick.
[03:46:34.172 --> 03:46:36.834]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[03:46:36.834 --> 03:46:40.076]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[03:46:40.076 --> 03:46:42.418]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price.
[03:46:42.418 --> 03:46:43.518]  It's about to sell out.
[03:46:43.518 --> 03:46:51.224]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:46:51.224 --> 03:46:52.384]  Thank you for your support.
[03:46:58.071 --> 03:47:03.999]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:47:23.608 --> 03:47:30.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:34.191]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:47:36.756 --> 03:47:39.057]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.057 --> 03:47:49.900]  Before I go into where we see markets going and what to invest in, I also want to keep encouraging you to do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:47:49.900 --> 03:47:56.242]  And they're doing everything they can to support you, not only with the information that they're putting out, but with the products that they have.
[03:47:56.242 --> 03:47:58.382]  And they got a great line right now coming.
[03:47:58.382 --> 03:48:00.063]  It's 25% off.
[03:48:00.063 --> 03:48:04.084]  And it's that triiodine they got.
[03:48:05.647 --> 03:48:12.868]  And Survival Shield X3, which is back, both of them, 25% off.
[03:48:12.868 --> 03:48:24.110]  So they're doing everything they can and they're giving you the next evolution in activated niacin iodine and at a massive sale with Survival Shield X3.
[03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:29.471]  And again, there's a limited time that you can get X3 for 25% off.
[03:48:29.471 --> 03:48:32.852]  And all the information about it is there and why you need it.
[03:48:33.499 --> 03:48:38.981]  And again, you need it not only for your health, but for the health of InfoWars.
[03:48:38.981 --> 03:48:46.203]  These people really, really, the staff works very, very hard, as Alex does, to give you the best that you can get.
[03:48:46.203 --> 03:48:53.185]  And so there's no better time now than to try the new and improved formulas of this Survival Shield X3.
[03:48:53.185 --> 03:48:58.367]  25% off a one-ounce bottle at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:48:59.760 --> 03:49:06.302]  And see what Triiodine can do for you, because they're doing everything they can to help you.
[03:49:06.302 --> 03:49:07.462]  So.
[03:49:07.462 --> 03:49:10.223]  You got it.
[03:49:10.223 --> 03:49:16.785]  And get it.
[03:49:16.785 --> 03:49:23.847]  So I was talking before about the economy and where it's going.
[03:49:23.847 --> 03:49:29.029]  You go to CNBC, the headline story, and matter of fact they ran it on InfoWars about
[03:49:29.761 --> 03:49:32.602]  Warren Buffett's warnings.
[03:49:32.602 --> 03:49:47.507]  The most important thing Warren Buffett said Saturday, and it isn't good news for the economy.
[03:49:47.507 --> 03:49:51.108]  So this is very simple.
[03:49:51.108 --> 03:49:55.149]  The higher interest rates go, the deeper the economy sinks.
[03:49:56.286 --> 03:50:00.929]  Because the bubble that was created was all fake money.
[03:50:00.929 --> 03:50:05.052]  Zero interest rate policy.
[03:50:05.052 --> 03:50:14.078]  I had a friend and he wanted to buy buildings for a house in Las Vegas back in March or January 2020.
[03:50:14.078 --> 03:50:17.600]  And I said, man, I wouldn't do it.
[03:50:17.600 --> 03:50:19.842]  This thing's going down big.
[03:50:19.842 --> 03:50:22.744]  I wouldn't buy it.
[03:50:22.744 --> 03:50:23.064]  I was 100% wrong.
[03:50:23.064 --> 03:50:23.184]  100% wrong.
[03:50:26.564 --> 03:50:31.567]  Yep.
[03:50:31.567 --> 03:50:55.899]  They didn't teach me about zero interest rate policy and the government dumping in countless trillions of PPE and other phony money to artificially boost up the economy as they fought the COVID war.
[03:50:55.899 --> 03:50:56.339]  Got it wrong.
[03:50:59.079 --> 03:51:00.819]  But what did they do?
[03:51:00.819 --> 03:51:06.580]  They built one of the biggest bubbles in modern history.
[03:51:06.580 --> 03:51:08.101]  All fake money.
[03:51:08.101 --> 03:51:09.581]  Not only here.
[03:51:09.581 --> 03:51:11.101]  In a country near you.
[03:51:11.101 --> 03:51:12.581]  Hey!
[03:51:12.581 --> 03:51:15.042]  I'm arrogant Gavin Newsom!
[03:51:15.042 --> 03:51:17.262]  Maybe I'll run for president!
[03:51:17.262 --> 03:51:20.303]  My daddy was a lawyer, worked for the Gettys.
[03:51:20.303 --> 03:51:22.103]  I'm a member of the club.
[03:51:22.103 --> 03:51:23.923]  Stay home!
[03:51:23.923 --> 03:51:28.244]  You stay home while I go out and party up at the French Laundry.
[03:51:28.894 --> 03:51:34.978]  That's like about $400 a plate, you little plantation worker of Slavelandia.
[03:51:34.978 --> 03:51:38.420]  We'll destroy your businesses.
[03:51:38.420 --> 03:51:43.344]  We'll destroy the hearts and soul of the people.
[03:51:43.344 --> 03:51:58.394]  We'll let the bigs get bigger as the billionaires got $27 trillion richer as we close down everything and flood the world with fake money.
[03:52:01.411 --> 03:52:03.913]  Why don't you shut up, Salenti?
[03:52:03.913 --> 03:52:05.854]  You don't know what you're talking about!
[03:52:05.854 --> 03:52:09.856]  I'm Jerome Powell!
[03:52:09.856 --> 03:52:12.458]  You're just Gerald Salenti!
[03:52:12.458 --> 03:52:16.940]  There's no inflation, it's only temporary!
[03:52:16.940 --> 03:52:19.142]  It's only transitory!
[03:52:19.142 --> 03:52:22.484]  Oh, and now we'll get screaming, yelling in there!
[03:52:22.484 --> 03:52:27.427]  It's only transgendatory!
[03:52:27.427 --> 03:52:30.769]  Inflation didn't go up because of what you said, Salenti?
[03:52:32.492 --> 03:52:38.813]  It went up because the plantation workers of Slavelandia are making too much money.
[03:52:38.813 --> 03:52:41.694]  And the rich aren't getting rich enough.
[03:52:41.694 --> 03:52:48.775]  The Walmarts aren't getting fatter with dough.
[03:52:48.775 --> 03:52:52.616]  The hedge funds aren't hedging as much.
[03:52:52.616 --> 03:52:55.057]  Who are those investment capitalists?
[03:53:00.805 --> 03:53:05.348]  They created a bubble the likes of which you've never seen.
[03:53:05.348 --> 03:53:07.329]  So what does this mean?
[03:53:07.329 --> 03:53:10.091]  They're raising interest rates.
[03:53:10.091 --> 03:53:12.433]  The whole thing was artificially propped up.
[03:53:12.433 --> 03:53:16.015]  In front of your eyes!
[03:53:16.015 --> 03:53:19.337]  I recall you about the office building bust?
[03:53:19.337 --> 03:53:20.458]  There she is.
[03:53:20.458 --> 03:53:20.618]  Ms.
[03:53:20.618 --> 03:53:22.639]  Fatsia Brut.
[03:53:22.639 --> 03:53:22.879]  Ms.
[03:53:22.879 --> 03:53:25.361]  Fatsia Bruta.
[03:53:25.361 --> 03:53:25.581]  Ms.
[03:53:25.581 --> 03:53:26.622]  Fatsia Bruta.
[03:53:28.436 --> 03:53:33.038]  Look, how can you be so dumb to listen to you with that arrogant attitude you got, sir?
[03:53:33.038 --> 03:53:34.258]  Arrogant?
[03:53:34.258 --> 03:53:35.919]  Don't you know who I am, sir, my dear?
[03:53:35.919 --> 03:53:37.920]  Well, I'm a member of the club.
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:39.000]  Oh, yeah.
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:41.081]  The Bankster Gangsters.
[03:53:41.081 --> 03:53:45.763]  Yeah, here's that, uh, cover of the, uh, Trends Journal.
[03:53:45.763 --> 03:53:48.004]  Great cover done by the brilliant Anthony Frieda.
[03:53:48.004 --> 03:53:54.267]  Man with a heart of gold.
[03:53:54.267 --> 03:53:54.647]  Here it is.
[03:53:54.647 --> 03:53:56.868]  Oh, what was the last job?
[03:53:57.552 --> 03:54:02.975]  Oh, you mean she was the head of the Federal Reserve?
[03:54:02.975 --> 03:54:07.117]  And now she's our Treasury Secretary?
[03:54:07.117 --> 03:54:11.019]  You get who's running the show?
[03:54:11.019 --> 03:54:15.801]  Oh, and the First Republic deal that they gave to JPMorgan Chase?
[03:54:15.801 --> 03:54:16.882]  They got bigger?
[03:54:16.882 --> 03:54:17.762]  Yep.
[03:54:17.762 --> 03:54:19.503]  Ooh.
[03:54:19.503 --> 03:54:21.484]  Convicted of five felonies.
[03:54:21.484 --> 03:54:22.344]  Five felonies.
[03:54:22.344 --> 03:54:23.185]  JPMorgan Chase.
[03:54:23.185 --> 03:54:24.045]  Nobody goes to jail.
[03:54:24.045 --> 03:54:25.386]  So what does all this mean?
[03:54:28.996 --> 03:54:33.218]  The death of the dollar has begun.
[03:54:33.218 --> 03:54:36.480]  Just like you live so long and then you die.
[03:54:36.480 --> 03:54:42.543]  I'm 76 years old, I have more years to live.
[03:54:42.543 --> 03:54:45.245]  Like that, anything can happen.
[03:54:45.245 --> 03:54:54.149]  Pancreatic cancer, hit by a car, shot.
[03:54:54.149 --> 03:54:55.190]  It's the end of the dollar.
[03:54:56.764 --> 03:55:05.689]  The world has had enough of America's economic and financial hegemony.
[03:55:05.689 --> 03:55:09.331]  You see the numbers came out?
[03:55:09.331 --> 03:55:14.154]  About how much the central banks are buying gold?
[03:55:14.154 --> 03:55:19.758]  These are up, in this quarter, like over 170-something percent compared to last year.
[03:55:19.758 --> 03:55:22.920]  They know how bad it is.
[03:55:22.920 --> 03:55:24.901]  That's them, the central banksters.
[03:55:25.976 --> 03:55:28.697]  They know how bad the deal is.
[03:55:28.697 --> 03:55:31.738]  You heard the head of the IMF come out.
[03:55:31.738 --> 03:55:33.018]  International Mafia.
[03:55:33.018 --> 03:55:33.658]  Oh, no, no.
[03:55:33.658 --> 03:55:34.819]  Be polite, Slinter.
[03:55:34.819 --> 03:55:37.239]  The International Monetary Fund?
[03:55:37.239 --> 03:55:38.280]  Yes.
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:39.740]  That was the matter with the Mafia.
[03:55:39.740 --> 03:55:41.260]  You guys, you didn't speak right.
[03:55:41.260 --> 03:55:43.601]  You gotta speak like they do, you know?
[03:55:43.601 --> 03:55:45.422]  You gotta get the language out right.
[03:55:45.422 --> 03:55:52.904]  You throw stupid words in there that people could swallow.
[03:55:52.904 --> 03:55:53.084]  Yeah.
[03:55:54.949 --> 03:55:58.590]  The International Monetary Fund just came out.
[03:55:58.590 --> 03:55:59.350]  Warning!
[03:55:59.350 --> 03:55:59.951]  Warning!
[03:55:59.951 --> 03:56:02.271]  Warning!
[03:56:02.271 --> 03:56:03.532]  Things are going to go down.
[03:56:03.532 --> 03:56:07.393]  Raise interest rates so the plantation workers don't have to get paid more.
[03:56:07.393 --> 03:56:11.854]  So the banks can get bigger.
[03:56:11.854 --> 03:56:14.055]  So to me, gold.
[03:56:14.055 --> 03:56:17.156]  Again, I don't give financial advice.
[03:56:17.156 --> 03:56:18.936]  Get your Trends Journal.
[03:56:18.936 --> 03:56:19.356]  It's $2.86 a week.
[03:56:21.724 --> 03:56:25.005]  Like I say, for a lousy cup of coffee somewhere, you're eating junk.
[03:56:25.005 --> 03:56:28.085]  And you're not getting anywhere else in the world.
[03:56:28.085 --> 03:56:39.088]  No magazine gives us in-depth trends analysis and trend forecasts of the socio-economic and geo-political events shaping the world.
[03:56:39.088 --> 03:56:41.628]  So, go to trendsjournal.com.
[03:56:41.628 --> 03:56:43.309]  This is serious.
[03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:45.149]  And remember the rally.
[03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:46.590]  And spread the word.
[03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:47.790]  Go to occupiedpeace.com.
[03:56:48.976 --> 03:56:49.657]  You know what?
[03:56:49.657 --> 03:56:51.558]  This isn't about me.
[03:56:51.558 --> 03:56:54.040]  Just so everybody get this, I'm having a rally.
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:56.022]  It's not about me.
[03:56:56.022 --> 03:56:58.184]  It's about you and us.
[03:56:58.184 --> 03:57:00.185]  And it cost me a lot of money to put them on.
[03:57:00.185 --> 03:57:03.668]  So you're not helping me.
[03:57:03.668 --> 03:57:07.311]  You're helping yourself.
[03:57:07.311 --> 03:57:10.814]  And if you don't want to do anything, don't do anything.
[03:57:10.814 --> 03:57:12.896]  But you're not doing it for me.
[03:57:12.896 --> 03:57:15.518]  You're doing it for us.
[03:57:15.518 --> 03:57:16.899]  And we're giving you everything we can.
[03:57:19.025 --> 03:57:20.146]  So try to make it here.
[03:57:20.146 --> 03:57:28.510]  It's a great, great, it's the most historic Four Corners in America.
[03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:32.872]  And again, we're going to try to get RFK live or on screen.
[03:57:32.872 --> 03:57:35.133]  We'll get him here one way or another.
[03:57:35.133 --> 03:57:43.037]  And we have other great speakers, Gary Null, John Whitehead, Frank Marano.
[03:57:43.037 --> 03:57:43.217]  So,
[03:57:43.960 --> 03:57:46.361]  Love you, and peace and goodwill.
[03:58:05.191 --> 03:58:11.822]  But M4 Wars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:58:11.822 --> 03:58:14.607]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:58:15.578 --> 03:58:17.679]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:58:17.679 --> 03:58:22.323]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:58:22.323 --> 03:58:26.045]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:58:26.045 --> 03:58:29.167]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[03:58:29.167 --> 03:58:31.729]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:33.090]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:58:33.090 --> 03:58:38.874]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:38.874 --> 03:58:40.234]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:58:40.234 --> 03:58:41.555]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:58:41.555 --> 03:58:45.498]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:58:46.339 --> 03:58:47.019]  We're good.
[03:59:01.554 --> 03:59:08.842]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:59:08.842 --> 03:59:16.409]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[03:59:17.210 --> 03:59:21.591]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:59:21.591 --> 03:59:23.131]  But you can go paint two or three times.
[03:59:23.131 --> 03:59:25.932]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:59:25.932 --> 03:59:31.153]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:59:31.153 --> 03:59:36.635]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:59:36.635 --> 03:59:38.275]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:59:38.275 --> 03:59:39.855]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:59:39.855 --> 03:59:41.396]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:59:41.396 --> 03:59:43.956]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[03:59:43.956 --> 03:59:45.177]  They're discounted right now.
[03:59:45.177 --> 03:59:45.877]  Finally back in stock.
[03:59:48.163 --> 03:59:52.775]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:59:52.775 --> 03:59:54.079]  It's Alex Jones!
