[00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:17.989]  The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates with all of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming.
[00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:25.619]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom, hear these words, we will not comply.
[00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.339]  California
[00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:41.104]  In New York, two captured states on each end of the country have officially rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their websites and said that indeed they're bringing back the controls.
[00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:46.307]  But we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago with the whistleblower info.
[00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:48.408]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday.
[00:00:48.408 --> 00:00:53.191]  An individual was in town and they are a high level manager
[00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:54.271]  What?
[00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:28.175]  People who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to B.A.2.A6.
[00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:39.540]  What the actual sh... But I was sent by the whistleblower a link to the California website and it says the controls are back and here they are right there in black and white.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.323]  They're gonna roll them out and through the institutions of the corporations of the hospitals to the hotels through the colleges to the public schools
[00:01:48.263 --> 00:01:52.966]  All over the country, they are shutting down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.689]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.190]  That's the beginning of it.
[00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.115]  My sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said, said middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.397]  Now five, six days later,
[00:02:20.992 --> 00:02:26.273]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine.
[00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:30.174]  And they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:33.075]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:35.835]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.876]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this.
[00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:41.137]  Go around and find out.
[00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:45.640]  FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.865]  So, certainly, they said that they will have an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:53.606]  There never was a COVID pandemic.
[00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.228]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2 novel virus.
[00:02:56.228 --> 00:02:57.529]  There was never any of those things.
[00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:06.996]  This was a behavior modification exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests that were being served.
[00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:07.817]  And let's remember,
[00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:22.178]  That the quote, until a pandemic is at emergency threshold, the public doesn't understand the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus or pan-influenza vaccine.
[00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:24.360]  We need the media to create the hype.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.482]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:32.184]  Investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process.
[00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:33.565]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak.
[00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:38.708]  That's a quote that was made at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published in 2015.
[00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:42.471]  This is the admission of terrorism again.
[00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:44.232]  Now, what did I say they were told?
[00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:48.032]  The beginning of the announcements begin September 15th.
[00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:55.536]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later.
[00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.076]  Everywhere.
[00:03:56.076 --> 00:04:02.359]  They just opened up on the public, every controlled corporate outlet, and then the institutions to create the fear.
[00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.862]  You can stop all flights.
[00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:09.006]  You can lock down entire countries.
[00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.228]  You can actually do that.
[00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:14.893]  And this, I would say, may make us more open.
[00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:21.500]  Two radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.342]  This has nothing to do with public health.
[00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:27.245]  It has nothing to do with breaking any waves.
[00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:29.767]  It was always about breaking people.
[00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:34.291]  There's a path of resistance or there is the path of total enslavement.
[00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.225]  Come on.
[00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:40.628]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:42.510]  You're stronger than this.
[00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:52.818]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities, and you can ask God to lead, guide, and direct you with discernment.
[00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:55.841]  And you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.254]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:05:06.254 --> 00:05:11.437]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation at 360 Win.
[00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:13.779]  BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.280]  The strongest you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.285]  Jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:25.306]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:26.567]  God gave it to us.
[00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:28.748]  And it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:32.210]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.812]  Most brands are 5% curcumidin.
[00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:36.833]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.276]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:41.797]  95% curcuminoid.
[00:05:41.797 --> 00:05:43.157]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:05:44.338 --> 00:05:46.180]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.122]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:50.904]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:18.652]  The last beacon of truth in a world of deception, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.652 --> 00:06:32.222]  While the controlled corporate press lies to you about what's happening now, we tell you the truth about what's
[00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:35.226]  Happening next.
[00:06:35.226 --> 00:06:36.467]  We are the InfoWar.
[00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:39.387]  We are tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:50.389]  All right, Marjorie Taylor Greene is here in Texas and she's going to be in studio with us coming up in the second hour tonight.
[00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.689]  Ahead of Owen Schroer hosting Sunday live 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:01.951]  She'll be on in the five o'clock hour with us to talk about the inside baseball on the move to begin the impeachment
[00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:07.104]  Of the globalist puppet that stole the election, Biden.
[00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:18.610]  We'll also talk about the Trump indictments and so much more with the amazing Congresswoman who's having a big effect in Congress and a big effect against the globalists.
[00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.171]  So she'll be joining us.
[00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:23.952]  In the meantime, boy, I've overprepared.
[00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:29.055]  I mean, I could talk for 10 hours about what we got here, but I'm going to try my best in this first hour to get to a lot of it.
[00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.291]  Then obviously the weekday show is coming up this week.
[00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:33.411]  A lot of big guests.
[00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.571]  A lot of big breaking news.
[00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:36.572]  Weekday is 11 a.m.
[00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:37.152]  to 3 p.m.
[00:07:37.152 --> 00:07:37.472]  Central.
[00:07:37.472 --> 00:07:38.452]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:38.452 --> 00:07:44.134]  Remember, that's how we fight the globalists is exposing their operations.
[00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:49.255]  The way we get around the censors is you deciding by word of mouth to promote the broadcast.
[00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:50.736]  You're doing a great job.
[00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:55.617]  I want to salute you and thank you all for your support and everything you do and you know who you are.
[00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:58.318]  Especially those that have gone to DefendJones.com.
[00:07:59.858 --> 00:08:02.440]  I made donations to my legal defense fund.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.401]  We're winning these cases.
[00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.862]  We're appealing these cases.
[00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:08.523]  We're navigating the bankruptcy.
[00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:12.786]  We have a 90% shot at staying on air.
[00:08:12.786 --> 00:08:15.888]  Conservatively, it's more like 95% on InfoWars.
[00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:21.491]  They're not going to stop me being on air, period.
[00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:22.652]  If you donate.
[00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:25.093]  So thank you all for your support at DefendJones.com.
[00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:25.694]  You know who you are.
[00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.142]  And we've already almost reached 10% of our goal.
[00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:32.143]  That is amazing, because I am out of financial bullets.
[00:08:32.143 --> 00:08:43.947]  I've spent everything I've had fighting these people, sold my house, sold everything, and you kept us on air the last few years, but now it's truly all up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:43.947 --> 00:08:53.470]  And the globalists act all victorious about their rigged court cases and their persecution of me, and none of the material things mean anything to me.
[00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.810]  None of it.
[00:08:55.157 --> 00:09:01.400]  At the end of the day, I care about standing up for freedom and justice, and I've, you know, got a beef.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.302]  I've got a major chip on my shoulder against the New World Order.
[00:09:04.302 --> 00:09:07.244]  I could talk about all the things they've done to my family, done to me.
[00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:09.385]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:11.066]  But the point is, I'm not a victim.
[00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:12.106]  I'm an overcomer.
[00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:14.828]  And I'm not laying there and taking it.
[00:09:14.828 --> 00:09:17.109]  I'm not taking it lying down.
[00:09:17.109 --> 00:09:18.790]  But I'm in your hands.
[00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.431]  So I am so thankful to viewers and listeners.
[00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:22.092]  It's a level of
[00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:30.154]  Thanks and appreciation that I have for really nobody else other than God.
[00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:33.336]  I'm very thankful to God, first and foremost.
[00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:38.399]  But I'll just be honest, I'm more thankful to listeners than to my parents, who are great people, by the way.
[00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.159]  I love them.
[00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:40.520]  I'm very thankful to them.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.843]  But staying in this fight is my total commitment, my total obsession.
[00:09:45.843 --> 00:09:50.165]  And I just really appreciate all you keep me in the fight from bottom of my heart.
[00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:50.906]  Thank you so much.
[00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:54.474]  Because I just can't take it lying down.
[00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:59.579]  And I know you can't either, and that's why you're here, and that's why you're spreading the word, and that's why you're so amazing.
[00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:04.123]  Okay, let me just really kind of get calm here, because it seems when I get calm, I'm able to cover it all.
[00:10:04.123 --> 00:10:08.106]  Let me just read to you the stacks.
[00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:09.848]  I mean, just the Covett stack alone today.
[00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:18.171]  Is about 15 articles and reports and it's just unbelievable, unbelievable.
[00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:26.277]  New York is officially announcing new COVID restrictions across the board being rolled out and drones to watch you.
[00:10:26.277 --> 00:10:33.803]  They now admit that the quote new booster for people to quote not get the new variant of COVID was tested on 23 people.
[00:10:35.848 --> 00:10:49.796]  We also have a big major federal ruling that hospitals and the FDA and all of them are liable for trying to create law on their own, something Congress does, not them.
[00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:52.658]  Just like when they shut down power plants, you know, at the EPA.
[00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:55.039]  That's not their right.
[00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:55.719]  They're not even toxic.
[00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:59.001]  The court ruled two years ago they had to stop that.
[00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:01.483]  They haven't stopped, but at least the court ruled that.
[00:11:01.483 --> 00:11:02.864]  It's a long process to the courts.
[00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:06.550]  It's now enforced that, but we're turning the tide.
[00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.772]  Remember they said three years ago, you can't prescribe ivermectin.
[00:11:10.772 --> 00:11:12.912]  Even if your doctor wants to, it doesn't matter how many studies you've got.
[00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:16.934]  That's all birdcage liner.
[00:11:16.934 --> 00:11:21.376]  We'll fire you or we'll come after you if you do with the FBI.
[00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:24.857]  No law, no nothing, just you can't prescribe a well-known antiviral.
[00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:27.098]  A whole bunch of new studies are out.
[00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:31.675]  The Australian government of all groups came out and said, okay, it works really great.
[00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:33.217]  We're wrong.
[00:11:33.217 --> 00:11:36.420]  They're now saying all over the world, oh, nobody ever locked you down.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.302]  Nobody ever made you take a shot.
[00:11:38.302 --> 00:11:40.364]  Got a bunch of compilations of that.
[00:11:40.364 --> 00:11:45.629]  I mean, just this stack alone is bonkers.
[00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:49.013]  Then, I just happened to run in today.
[00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:51.636]  I did about five hours of research at the house.
[00:11:53.424 --> 00:12:04.486]  Just on Twitter alone, just looking at video clips of the Globalists and their statements, they're making so many depopulation statements and so many you-will-eat-the-bug statements and so many we're-gonna-put-chips-in-you statements and so many pedophilia is good statements.
[00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:07.067]  I mean, I can't even keep track of it.
[00:12:07.067 --> 00:12:20.990]  I've seen 30 plus clips today that I've never seen of Sean Penn and Yuval Noah Harari and Jane Goodall and King Charles and just a whole list of criminals.
[00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:31.704]  of just degenerate pigs saying, oh, the lockdowns are just getting you ready for the climate lockdowns, which Biden's getting ready to announce.
[00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:33.645]  So this is just whacked out.
[00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:36.167]  This is just amazing.
[00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:39.669]  Yeah, we're going to take the cows, we're going to turn your power off.
[00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:45.673]  And I mean, I've got like, I looked at it, we can't play this 15 minutes of them saying it.
[00:12:48.496 --> 00:12:56.961]  That's what should make my job so easy, is these bastards are... And it's not somebody's fault if they didn't have a dad in their life.
[00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:59.442]  Bastards, way too nice a term for them.
[00:12:59.442 --> 00:13:01.143]  Some of my best friends are bastards.
[00:13:01.143 --> 00:13:06.246]  These cockroaches, but cockroaches aren't bad compared to these people.
[00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:08.427]  These literal demon creatures.
[00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:11.829]  These succubus.
[00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:13.109]  So I've got that, and I'm...
[00:13:15.043 --> 00:13:16.284]  Maybe I'll just play a few of the clubs.
[00:13:16.284 --> 00:13:18.907]  I just don't know.
[00:13:18.907 --> 00:13:19.808]  It's an impossible job.
[00:13:19.808 --> 00:13:26.475]  I mean, how do you get ready, like, probably four hours yesterday and five hours today and then try to present it in an hour before MTG gets in here?
[00:13:26.475 --> 00:13:29.439]  But yes, we are presenting it.
[00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:30.780]  But yeah, they're official.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.922]  We're bringing back the code restrictions.
[00:13:32.922 --> 00:13:34.825]  While they gaslight you and say, but we're not.
[00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:39.138]  High schools, elementary shut down all over the country.
[00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:42.421]  It was like two states two weeks ago.
[00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:46.604]  It's like 15 states this morning.
[00:13:46.604 --> 00:13:48.606]  Really critical thing I want to get to first.
[00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:51.349]  We'll come back for break.
[00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:52.490]  They've hit the panic alarm.
[00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:59.093]  The DNC has, and said, look, Trump is unstoppable basically.
[00:13:59.093 --> 00:14:01.515]  Everything we do blows up in our face.
[00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:06.819]  He's got a powerful political movement, Donald Brazil said, which we don't need her to tell us that, we already know it.
[00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:12.103]  And we're basically out of bullets, political bullets.
[00:14:12.103 --> 00:14:14.545]  That's why I said the real bullets come next.
[00:14:14.545 --> 00:14:16.186]  And I don't say that to be dramatic.
[00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:19.029]  It's an easy arc, an easy graph, like Tucker Carlson said.
[00:14:19.029 --> 00:14:21.551]  They're going to kill him.
[00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:23.733]  We're going to try.
[00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:40.390]  And that's where the ADL comes in, and the Southern Primary Law Center and these people, and these Nazi groups that they've turned on everywhere, that I mean are 100, everybody's, I mean literally 99% of the comments on Instagram, Twitter, I was, I spent like an hour on this today.
[00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.455]  No one is buying that these are quote real Nazis.
[00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:45.135]  I mean these are
[00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:50.083]  Feds within groups of prisoners.
[00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:55.947]  These are white prison gang trash, just like there's black prison gang trash, Hispanic prison gang trash.
[00:14:55.947 --> 00:14:59.469]  These are white prison gang trash.
[00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:06.293]  And then one of them is a Ukrainian commando Nazi leader who fights in Ukraine and they admit works for the CIA.
[00:15:06.293 --> 00:15:10.055]  Yeah, there he is.
[00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:12.317]  Let me tell you something.
[00:15:12.317 --> 00:15:14.418]  These people are dangerous as hell.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.821]  And when they kill Biden, because they're going to kill him too in my view.
[00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:23.022]  And I'm saying, I think they're going to kill Biden and Trump.
[00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:26.123]  I just got to go with what I see.
[00:15:26.123 --> 00:15:27.403]  We can stop it, hopefully.
[00:15:27.403 --> 00:15:31.505]  But I think Biden and Trump are both dead.
[00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:34.085]  And I'm going to tell you more about that when we come back.
[00:15:34.085 --> 00:15:44.829]  And it's going to be... I mean, I know when I look at something and when I study it and I just get this chill up my spine.
[00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:45.669]  I mean, I'll say it.
[00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:55.760]  It's feds, leading prisoners, and MKUltra, and their currency is that these people, most of them are felons, and so they're being controlled by their probation officers to do this.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.741]  They're getting ready to set them up.
[00:16:01.247 --> 00:16:08.655]  The Ultimate Tumeric product on the market has returned to InfowarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.

[00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:06.334]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.334 --> 00:20:07.635]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:43.790 --> 00:21:01.979]  Starting about two and a half years ago, once Biden had fully ensconced himself over stealing the election, and the CIA public coup against the voters of America, to seize the Republic fully and turn it into a pure engine of evil, I saw them brand their opposition as white supremacists.
[00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:10.584]  And I didn't define a white supremacist as anybody that questions open borders, or wars, or lockdowns, or forced injections, or elections.
[00:21:10.584 --> 00:21:11.244]  And I said then,
[00:21:13.558 --> 00:21:21.563]  They're not doing a full branding and saying white supremacism is this epic threat, number one cause of crime, number one crime in America.
[00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:23.985]  When anybody knows that's like number one crime.
[00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:28.208]  Like what, maybe every six months a white supremacist goes and shoots some innocent black people.
[00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:28.968]  It's terrible.
[00:21:28.968 --> 00:21:29.749]  It happens.
[00:21:29.749 --> 00:21:33.071]  Just happened a few weeks ago, but been like a year maybe since that happened.
[00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:34.892]  I mean, it's, it's, it's rare.
[00:21:34.892 --> 00:21:35.713]  Okay.
[00:21:35.713 --> 00:21:36.173]  Still terrible.
[00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:40.888]  You can just look at it, and there's thousands of other data points.
[00:21:40.888 --> 00:21:45.872]  You're like, okay, they're going to blow some stuff up or shoot a bunch of people.
[00:21:45.872 --> 00:21:51.497]  Black colleges, I said black grocery stores, neighborhoods, churches.
[00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:55.361]  And then I even saw this Patriot Front Fed Group.
[00:21:55.361 --> 00:22:01.546]  One day when I was down by the park with my daughter, I took her to Martin Springs about two months ago, and we're leaving.
[00:22:02.369 --> 00:22:17.438]  And I wasn't going to pull my phone out while we were in traffic because it was dangerous pulling out but I saw like five trucks shoot by with all them in the back of it and I'm just like and I later looked it up and they've been here running around agitating people in East Austin messing with the brown people.
[00:22:17.438 --> 00:22:23.062]  I mean it's just the feds are disgusting people folks and this new group they've got
[00:22:24.557 --> 00:22:29.981]  I mean, absolute Hollywood, ridiculous demon-devil outfits they wear.
[00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:32.623]  I mean, they're basically wearing red pajamas.
[00:22:32.623 --> 00:22:38.387]  These red and black outfits with huge swastikas, saying the most ridiculous crap.
[00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:51.577]  And then I spent an hour researching them, and oh, one guy's a CIA operative in Ukraine, and a captain, and then another guy is a known, you know, connected to the CIA, and then another guy, and a whole bunch of them are convicts.
[00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:58.991]  And they get told, you go sign up, you work under these guys, and we will not put you back in jail.
[00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:02.488]  And that's all this is.
[00:23:02.488 --> 00:23:08.370]  Because when you go to prison, folks, they make you organize into black gangs, Hispanic gangs, or white gangs.
[00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.632]  And on the East and West Coast, where they have more Asians, it's Asian gangs.
[00:23:12.632 --> 00:23:16.193]  They put you on the Asian wing, the Hispanic wing, the black wing, the white wing.
[00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:21.535]  And if you don't want to join one of those gangs, you're black and not racist, well, they're going to kill your ass, probably.
[00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:22.635]  And the same thing with the white people.
[00:23:22.635 --> 00:23:26.537]  So you basically have to join these gangs or they put you in solitary confinement.
[00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:29.038]  And a lot of people say, I'm not joining the Nazis.
[00:23:29.038 --> 00:23:31.599]  So they go, okay, you're in solitary confinement.
[00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:37.941]  So they've got armies of these lunatics, just like the black Israelites and just in the matcha people.
[00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:41.963]  It's all the exact crap.
[00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:43.463]  It's a rerun of it.
[00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:48.925]  And then, I mean, I spent an hour and it's, it's their commanders in Ukraine, Hailing Hitler.
[00:23:48.925 --> 00:23:50.506]  We have all the video.
[00:23:50.506 --> 00:23:53.447]  I got like eight videos of this.
[00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:53.627]  So,
[00:23:56.653 --> 00:24:02.218]  The problem is, to do a deep dive, the public is so ignorant about this, it's viral on Twitter.
[00:24:02.218 --> 00:24:07.242]  Jones claims the ADL is the most Nazi organization he's ever seen in modern history.
[00:24:07.242 --> 00:24:08.103]  Why?
[00:24:08.103 --> 00:24:09.384]  That's ridiculous!
[00:24:09.384 --> 00:24:15.329]  The ADL is a leading Jewish civil rights organization.
[00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:17.251]  Man, you want the deep dive on that?
[00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:19.133]  That would take about 10 hours just on the ADL.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.401]  Censoring people, spying on people.
[00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:34.504]  The ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, particularly, have been caught funding and creating and running white supremacist groups.
[00:24:34.504 --> 00:24:43.369]  The Southern Poverty Law Center ran the white supremacist training camp in Elohim City that then was with McVeigh as the Patsy in Oklahoma City.
[00:24:43.369 --> 00:24:46.190]  Go look it up, it came out in court.
[00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.192]  They killed police officers, and I've interviewed their families that exposed this, murdered them.
[00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:55.954]  That's like dozens of interviews I did years ago with all the witnesses.
[00:24:55.954 --> 00:24:56.494]  I've been there.
[00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:56.894]  I've shown it.
[00:24:56.894 --> 00:24:58.456]  It came out in federal court.
[00:24:58.456 --> 00:25:03.681]  So the average liberal goes, what do you mean the AGL is working with Nazis?
[00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:06.443]  That's dumb.
[00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:17.653]  Everybody's probably seen episode three of Star Wars, the prequel, where Senator Palpatine is running the opposition military that's attacking them.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.401]  And he's running the resistance to it.
[00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:22.822]  And he uses that to take full control.
[00:25:22.822 --> 00:25:27.603]  I mean, it's in a children's movie how this works.
[00:25:27.603 --> 00:25:30.244]  And people better get, I mean, come on, folks.
[00:25:30.244 --> 00:25:33.846]  Crazy dudes in red devil outfits.
[00:25:36.482 --> 00:25:44.907]  And you remember the famous photos, you know, after January 6th of some of the rallies in DC, and people would look at them and they'd go, oh my god, these are all feds.
[00:25:44.907 --> 00:25:50.531]  And then they face scanned them, you can do that with Google Images, and found most of them are FBI agents.
[00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:57.355]  Now, the FBI agents, you can tell, they look yuppie, they look like they go on, you know, 100 mile bike rides.
[00:25:57.355 --> 00:26:01.257]  They're just told to go out there and quote, be on cover as white supremacists.
[00:26:01.257 --> 00:26:03.579]  That still creates the illusion of white supremacists being everywhere.
[00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:12.905]  But with the Patriot Front, that's feds too all wearing masks with some useful idiots under them to create the illusion of white supremacy we're in.
[00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:18.493]  But this new group that I'm not going to have a ton of time to get into today.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.788]  I mean, one investigation of that, and I'm telling you, and I knew it as soon as I saw him, I said, I bet they got training camps set up.
[00:26:28.788 --> 00:26:36.815]  I bet they got massive funding, and that's where they're getting the lunatics in that are going to be the ones that go after Trump slash Biden.
[00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:40.779]  And sure as hell, they got training camps in Maine.
[00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:43.582]  They got training camps in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:54.245]  So, I mean, come on here, I'm telling you, they're going to have some white supremacists killed by, and then say all of us are behind it.
[00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:55.545]  You think January 6th was bad?
[00:26:55.545 --> 00:27:01.589]  That's just a dress rehearsal show.
[00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:10.395]  Everybody better look into this, you better research it, you better know it, and let me tell you, one look at these people, and I did a little over an hour just watching their videos, looking up who they were, and
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.222]  You have a couple fed psychologists that are controlling it.
[00:27:16.222 --> 00:27:21.806]  You've got people they're threatening to put in prison that are the leaders if they don't play ball with the globalists.
[00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:39.696]  And then you've got mentally ill prisoners who were trained to be white supremacists in prison and they're gonna find the lunatics, folks, who will be the patsies when they, in my view, detonate a car bomb or truck bomb or something to kill Biden.
[00:27:39.696 --> 00:27:41.698]  So as soon as I saw this,
[00:27:42.682 --> 00:27:45.164]  I went, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, that's it!
[00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:49.427]  It was like the alarms went off, I was like, oh my god, that's it.
[00:27:49.427 --> 00:27:54.971]  And this is just the newest group they have pop up like herpes.
[00:27:54.971 --> 00:27:57.353]  It won't go away.
[00:27:57.353 --> 00:28:06.199]  So, I mean, I was already sure of it, you can see all the pre-preparation, all the brainwashing.
[00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:09.561]  It is going down, okay?
[00:28:09.561 --> 00:28:11.263]  And the good news is,
[00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:15.973]  People across the political spectrum are waking up and getting this.
[00:28:15.973 --> 00:28:22.540]  And I noticed today, I said an hour on this, I had more than an hour just on this because I saw it everywhere else, probably an hour and a half or so.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.422]  The black folks completely see through this.
[00:28:24.422 --> 00:28:29.167]  I mean, I did not see one major black poster that was not just going, look at this ridiculous crap.
[00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:31.810]  This is what they've got now, is we won't support Trump?
[00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.011]  I mean, this is all you can come up with?
[00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:33.852]  I mean, come on, man.
[00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:36.633]  Give me a break here.
[00:28:36.633 --> 00:28:39.954]  This is so stupidly obvious.
[00:28:39.954 --> 00:28:42.875]  How stupid do you think we are?
[00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:56.218]  We're all getting screwed over with poison shots, and open borders, and gas prices, and World War III, and now they parade around these clowns screaming, HAL HITLER, and then a whole bunch of Ukrainian intelligence operatives that publicly work for the CIA.
[00:28:59.031 --> 00:29:00.592]  It's just a mask.
[00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:02.413]  It's just six feet.
[00:29:02.413 --> 00:29:04.975]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[00:29:04.975 --> 00:29:07.397]  It's just non-essential workers.
[00:29:07.397 --> 00:29:09.938]  It's just until we work it out.
[00:29:09.938 --> 00:29:11.459]  It's just a bar.
[00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:13.641]  It's just a restaurant.
[00:29:13.641 --> 00:29:15.542]  It's just nursing homes.
[00:29:15.542 --> 00:29:17.403]  It's just schools.
[00:29:17.403 --> 00:29:20.706]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:22.467]  It's just until the cases go down.
[00:29:23.267 --> 00:29:25.508]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[00:29:25.508 --> 00:29:28.329]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:30.790]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:35.372]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[00:29:35.372 --> 00:29:37.853]  It's just churches and mosques.
[00:29:37.853 --> 00:29:39.534]  It's just singing.
[00:29:39.534 --> 00:29:42.215]  It's just travel.
[00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:44.676]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:46.617]  It's just for the greater good.
[00:29:46.617 --> 00:29:48.038]  It's just fact-checking.
[00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:50.541]  Not censorship.
[00:29:50.541 --> 00:29:52.485]  It's just mandatory.
[00:29:52.485 --> 00:29:54.368]  It isn't just at all.
[00:29:54.368 --> 00:29:57.693]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.

[00:30:10.971 --> 00:30:11.832]  Knockout.
[00:30:11.832 --> 00:30:13.172]  What's better?
[00:30:13.172 --> 00:30:13.913]  Down and out.
[00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:14.453]  What's better?
[00:30:14.453 --> 00:30:16.714]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:21.637]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.294]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:30:26.294 --> 00:30:27.635]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:30:27.635 --> 00:30:28.937]  They're all very diverse.
[00:30:28.937 --> 00:30:39.126]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[00:31:19.237 --> 00:31:20.418]  It's about to sell out.
[00:31:20.418 --> 00:31:21.918]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[00:31:58.547 --> 00:32:04.312]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[00:32:04.312 --> 00:32:09.136]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:12.159]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:21.747]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[00:33:01.323 --> 00:33:07.225]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.218 --> 00:33:27.564]  We're in the season of permanent dictatorship in America.
[00:33:27.564 --> 00:33:37.174]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a game.
[00:33:37.174 --> 00:33:39.797]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:39.797 --> 00:33:44.862]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:34:00.995 --> 00:34:04.157]  All right, so here's the bottom line.
[00:34:04.157 --> 00:34:05.438]  The globalists are in trouble.
[00:34:05.438 --> 00:34:06.879]  They know they're losing the public.
[00:34:06.879 --> 00:34:08.960]  They're losing the people all over the world.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:18.046]  They are desperate for a whole cornucopia of cyber attacks and wars and collapsing borders and famines, and they're running it all.
[00:34:18.046 --> 00:34:24.489]  The UN ran three plus years of lockdowns, the third world, mass starvation, 80 plus million died, not even a blip on the radar screen.
[00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.411]  Now they say there's a global food crisis.
[00:34:26.411 --> 00:34:28.392]  The third world is descending into hell.
[00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.031]  The UN's organizing them all to come into the U.S.
[00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:36.172]  We're being hit from all sides.
[00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:52.516]  And the perfect way to energize the left, and to go after the left's political opposition saying we're all white supremacists, and turn Homeland Security loose on us, they're being publicly trained to just say any opposition's illegal.
[00:34:52.516 --> 00:34:55.297]  They want to outlaw their political opposition, have a one-party system.
[00:34:56.673 --> 00:34:57.755]  Is to kill Joe Biden.
[00:34:57.755 --> 00:35:05.889]  That way they get rid of him, they turn him into a martyr and then they can put in whoever they want and kill Trump and they believe that that will basically
[00:35:07.276 --> 00:35:09.037]  Shut down their opposition.
[00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:22.320]  And when the Trump people get mad, the left will just detonate truck bombs and things and say the right wing did it because of Trump being assassinated and use that as a pretext to bring in absolute total martial law, total censorship, total control.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.801]  They're going for broke.
[00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:26.722]  All the lockdowns, all the poison shots, all the censorship.
[00:35:26.722 --> 00:35:28.362]  That was a dress rehearsal.
[00:35:28.362 --> 00:35:30.603]  That was nothing.
[00:35:30.603 --> 00:35:31.503]  That was nothing.
[00:35:33.203 --> 00:35:37.886]  Now the reason I'm saying this, even though it endangers my life, is it's true.
[00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:44.750]  You can see the writing on the wall, you can see all the pieces in place, but we win by telling the truth either way.
[00:35:44.750 --> 00:36:02.061]  Because if we expose them and get out ahead of this, like the new lockdowns I told you were coming, the new controls, which are here just like I told you, if they do kill Biden and or Trump or try, because the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray,
[00:36:06.482 --> 00:36:14.945]  People are going to remember this broadcast and no matter what they do, put it on a thumb drive, show people in person at your church, they're going to be listening when this goes down.
[00:36:14.945 --> 00:36:18.606]  And I'd say 50% chance we can stop this.
[00:36:18.606 --> 00:36:21.347]  Very good chance you're going to get front row seats to this.
[00:36:21.347 --> 00:36:23.528]  They're going to turn your power off.
[00:36:23.528 --> 00:36:26.289]  They're going to release new bioweapons way worse than COVID.
[00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:27.129]  I mean, this is it.
[00:36:27.129 --> 00:36:29.650]  This is the takeover of America and the world.
[00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:30.731]  This is the new world order.
[00:36:30.731 --> 00:36:31.111]  This is it.
[00:36:32.987 --> 00:36:34.207]  And I'm not gonna back down.
[00:36:34.207 --> 00:36:39.889]  I'm not gonna, you know, cut back my rhetoric, because this is the truth.
[00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:45.771]  Now, I tried this myself today, and we're gonna do a demonstration tomorrow on air.
[00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:46.212]  It's true.
[00:36:46.212 --> 00:36:56.635]  I may try to reprogram it in the meantime, but Alexa is an AI system, and it's programmed by the hundreds of millions or billions, I think it's like a billion users.
[00:36:56.635 --> 00:36:58.716]  Google's like four billion, Apple's like four billion.
[00:37:01.348 --> 00:37:02.969]  I think Alexa's over a billion with Amazon.
[00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:12.711]  The point is, is that you ask Alexa as of today, Alexa, what's going to happen with the 2024 election?
[00:37:12.711 --> 00:37:15.012]  And it says there will be no election.
[00:37:15.012 --> 00:37:23.975]  And I've had people at the gas station two days ago, I got a bunch of text messages and calls, and my wife asked me about it because her friends and people are asking her.
[00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:26.831]  And we had some friends over the house last night.
[00:37:26.831 --> 00:37:28.393]  They were asking me about it.
[00:37:28.393 --> 00:37:32.897]  So the buzz is out there that there won't be a 2024 election.
[00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:34.999]  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:37:34.999 --> 00:37:38.542]  I'm saying we're not in normal situation anymore.
[00:37:38.542 --> 00:37:41.344]  We're not in Kansas, as they say, anymore.
[00:37:41.344 --> 00:37:43.686]  Truth is, we never were.
[00:37:43.686 --> 00:37:50.412]  So before I get to DNC Chair Donna Brazile and the rest of this, and then MTG coming up at studio.
[00:37:50.412 --> 00:37:51.293]  She's arriving very soon.
[00:37:55.285 --> 00:38:07.736]  Let's play the clip I just talked about with Alexa, where the man asked the machine yesterday, what's happened with the 2024 election?
[00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:09.818]  Hey, want to hear some fucked up shit?
[00:38:09.818 --> 00:38:10.098]  Alexa.
[00:38:10.098 --> 00:38:15.603]  The 2024 American election will not take place.
[00:38:15.603 --> 00:38:16.424]  There will be no winner.
[00:38:25.346 --> 00:38:35.049]  I'm not sure what the crew's doing this clip, because the clip I sent them, A, we have to bleep stuff, but B, he says it and then it says it.
[00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:42.552]  Can we redownload that and do that again?
[00:38:42.552 --> 00:38:44.272]  No, no, no, no, no problem.
[00:38:44.272 --> 00:38:44.972]  I understand.
[00:38:44.972 --> 00:38:46.693]  I sent the clip today.
[00:38:46.693 --> 00:38:47.973]  Maybe it was not on my list.
[00:38:47.973 --> 00:38:49.974]  That's, that's fine.
[00:39:01.783 --> 00:39:03.004]  I have to go rebroadcast for a few minutes.
[00:39:03.004 --> 00:39:15.980]  You guys play some promos or something, okay?
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.001]  Alright, we can't play promos either.
[00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.017]  I don't know.
[00:40:09.597 --> 00:40:17.564]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[00:40:17.564 --> 00:40:23.369]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[00:40:23.369 --> 00:40:25.711]  The left have wised up to this.
[00:40:25.711 --> 00:40:31.115]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[00:40:31.115 --> 00:40:32.456]  The social media giants.
[00:40:32.456 --> 00:40:32.857]  And they are.
[00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:38.923]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[00:40:38.923 --> 00:40:43.748]  So far, the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:40:43.748 --> 00:40:50.614]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist...
[00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:57.395]  Guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:40:57.395 --> 00:41:04.440]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:10.725]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal...
[00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:15.890]  Regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with big tech.
[00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.391]  People know what's true.
[00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:18.711]  They can smell it.
[00:41:18.711 --> 00:41:23.772]  InfoWars, the most banned network.
[00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:25.633]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:25.633 --> 00:41:27.934]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:41:27.934 --> 00:41:31.675]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:41:31.675 --> 00:41:36.536]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:41:36.536 --> 00:41:39.297]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:41:40.802 --> 00:41:45.847]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:41:45.847 --> 00:41:56.836]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:41:56.836 --> 00:42:02.882]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:42:03.582 --> 00:42:09.627]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:12.369]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:12.369 --> 00:42:15.711]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.894]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:42:19.654 --> 00:42:31.526]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:42:31.526 --> 00:42:34.929]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:39.453]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[00:42:40.254 --> 00:42:42.714]  And the will to be able to face this hard.
[00:42:42.714 --> 00:42:44.315]  And to give me the strength to carry on.
[00:42:44.315 --> 00:42:53.796]  Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:42:53.796 --> 00:42:54.777]  I know why.
[00:42:54.777 --> 00:43:00.338]  Because it's scary.
[00:43:00.338 --> 00:43:04.718]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:43:04.718 --> 00:43:07.079]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:43:07.079 --> 00:43:08.019]  You're not going to be able to just
[00:43:09.568 --> 00:43:12.769]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:43:12.769 --> 00:43:35.937]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:43:37.577 --> 00:43:43.081]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:45.182]  It should take over your life.
[00:43:45.182 --> 00:43:46.603]  I mean, what else?
[00:43:46.603 --> 00:43:49.865]  What else could it do?
[00:43:49.865 --> 00:44:00.212]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:44:01.914 --> 00:44:05.315]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:44:05.315 --> 00:44:13.299]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:18.221]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:44:18.221 --> 00:44:19.341]  InfoWars.
[00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:24.183]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:44:24.183 --> 00:44:28.785]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:44:35.342 --> 00:44:43.344]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:44:43.344 --> 00:44:56.427]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:44:57.887 --> 00:45:01.710]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space.
[00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.032]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:45:06.032 --> 00:45:10.836]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[00:45:10.836 --> 00:45:27.627]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling in full war.
[00:45:28.227 --> 00:45:33.811]  This is reality.
[00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.413]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:45:36.413 --> 00:45:38.474]  We know the government's planning terrorism.
[00:45:38.474 --> 00:45:41.036]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners.
[00:45:41.036 --> 00:45:44.218]  If you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[00:45:44.218 --> 00:45:48.241]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies.
[00:45:48.241 --> 00:45:51.023]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[00:45:51.023 --> 00:45:51.984]  Do you got me?
[00:45:51.984 --> 00:45:54.125]  It's time to stop submitting to this parody.
[00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:56.187]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[00:45:57.187 --> 00:45:58.047]  I want freedom!
[00:45:58.047 --> 00:45:58.847]  That's what I want!
[00:45:58.847 --> 00:45:59.968]  That's what you should want!
[00:45:59.968 --> 00:46:00.968]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:46:00.968 --> 00:46:02.508]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:46:02.508 --> 00:46:04.549]  This isn't a game!
[00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:07.629]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:46:07.629 --> 00:46:10.230]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:14.351]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:46:14.351 --> 00:46:18.252]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.381]  We are in a crisis.
[00:46:50.381 --> 00:47:00.184]  Admitting it, admitting our government's been seized by corrupt globalist corporations, that our intelligence agencies are fully controlled, is the beginning of taking our country back.
[00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:05.045]  And all the numbers, all the facts show a huge global, worldwide awakening.
[00:47:05.045 --> 00:47:07.166]  We're going to break in about 12 minutes.
[00:47:07.166 --> 00:47:09.287]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to be in studio with us.
[00:47:09.287 --> 00:47:15.629]  While I was walking right back in the studio, I saw her in there, can't wait to have her here with us tonight, in studio.
[00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.871]  So let's start going to these clips.
[00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:23.875]  Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile sounds alarm on MAGA movement.
[00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:27.919]  I've never seen anything like this with Donald Trump.
[00:47:27.919 --> 00:47:30.460]  Listen to what she had to say today.
[00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.070]  We're good to go.
[00:48:01.818 --> 00:48:02.298]  I'll also just...
[00:48:29.136 --> 00:48:30.277]  Donna Brazile is wrong.
[00:48:30.277 --> 00:48:31.577]  This is a lot bigger than a movement.
[00:48:31.577 --> 00:48:35.959]  This is a global, forth-turning, political realignment.
[00:48:35.959 --> 00:48:39.121]  Not just here, but all over the world, people are sick of Black Rock.
[00:48:39.121 --> 00:48:40.622]  They're sick of State Street.
[00:48:40.622 --> 00:48:41.742]  They're sick of the UN.
[00:48:41.742 --> 00:48:43.183]  They're sick of King Charles.
[00:48:43.183 --> 00:48:44.503]  They're sick of Klaus Schwab.
[00:48:44.503 --> 00:48:45.844]  They're sick of Bill Gates.
[00:48:45.844 --> 00:48:47.425]  They're sick to death.
[00:48:47.425 --> 00:48:54.368]  And they know they just put us under lockdowns and all these poison shots and all that's come out, and now they're trying to roll out new lockdowns.
[00:48:54.368 --> 00:48:55.849]  They already got us in a hot war with Russia.
[00:48:57.711 --> 00:48:58.872]  So lady, don't you get it?
[00:48:58.872 --> 00:49:00.353]  You could kill Trump tomorrow.
[00:49:00.353 --> 00:49:01.374]  This isn't going away.
[00:49:01.374 --> 00:49:05.358]  And every day you lose more people.
[00:49:05.358 --> 00:49:10.923]  And there's no amount of election fraud that's going to save you.
[00:49:10.923 --> 00:49:21.412]  The Republican Party has a beachhead in it of populists led by Trump and MTG and Jim Jordan and Senator Hawley and a few others.
[00:49:23.134 --> 00:49:25.557]  But that's just a manifestation of our awakening.
[00:49:25.557 --> 00:49:28.059]  I mean, I look at Joe Rogan on the air we go to dinner.
[00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:29.341]  He's completely awake.
[00:49:29.341 --> 00:49:31.763]  He's as hardcore as I am.
[00:49:31.763 --> 00:49:34.146]  Look at what James Woods is putting out now.
[00:49:34.146 --> 00:49:37.489]  There's a global government that wants to enslave us and poison us and kill us.
[00:49:37.489 --> 00:49:39.492]  I mean, that sounds crazy, but it's true!
[00:49:44.011 --> 00:49:52.137]  And I go back just a few years ago when everybody was turning their back on me, but MTG just got in Congress, and she said, Alex Jones is right, Alex Jones is a great guy.
[00:49:52.137 --> 00:49:54.599]  I don't care what they say about him, it's lies.
[00:49:54.599 --> 00:49:59.462]  She knew it was bigger than me, but they were using me as a symbol to demonize populism, and she knew to stand up for it.
[00:49:59.462 --> 00:50:03.606]  And it's the same thing.
[00:50:03.606 --> 00:50:05.587]  Stop running from the truth, everybody.
[00:50:05.587 --> 00:50:09.310]  And I know the general audience isn't doing that, but if you ask Alexa,
[00:50:10.421 --> 00:50:12.162]  For some reason we import the video over and over again.
[00:50:12.162 --> 00:50:12.663]  It won't play.
[00:50:12.663 --> 00:50:13.744]  It's got some bug in it.
[00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.645]  We're going to find it later somewhere else and play it.
[00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.907]  Or put it in post when it goes to be in that video.
[00:50:17.907 --> 00:50:20.749]  You ask Alexa, you ask the AI, hey is there going to be an election?
[00:50:20.749 --> 00:50:21.390]  No.
[00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:22.511]  There will not be an election.
[00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:26.714]  The Democratic Party will have war with Russia and become a dictatorship.
[00:50:26.714 --> 00:50:29.536]  And you go, well Alexa isn't God, but it's AI.
[00:50:29.536 --> 00:50:33.900]  And it picks up what is the most popular thing on the internet.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.702]  It samples billions of conversations in text every day.
[00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:39.392]  Conservatively.
[00:50:39.392 --> 00:50:40.773]  Probably more than that.
[00:50:40.773 --> 00:50:45.016]  I mean just America's hundreds of millions of people using it a day.
[00:50:45.016 --> 00:50:45.877]  Thousands of clicks.
[00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:54.184]  I mean it's got to be like billions upon billions and billions of things it's sampled and it's saying no election.
[00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.285]  Now I'm not saying that's the case.
[00:50:56.285 --> 00:50:58.627]  I'm simply saying these people are done.
[00:50:58.627 --> 00:50:59.888]  They're cornered rats.
[00:50:59.888 --> 00:51:04.732]  It's come out that the prosecutor in Georgia is getting all this out-of-state illegal money to her campaign.
[00:51:04.732 --> 00:51:05.453]  Millions of dollars.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.181]  You're like, well that's illegal.
[00:51:07.181 --> 00:51:08.542]  They don't care.
[00:51:08.542 --> 00:51:09.763]  They're crooks.
[00:51:09.763 --> 00:51:14.167]  They've gone for broke.
[00:51:14.167 --> 00:51:30.100]  And it just gets more insane by the minute and suddenly there are all these white supremacist groups in these clown outfits running around while Biden says the number one threat is white supremacists and all these crazy groups pop up that are completely federal.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.001]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:40.627]  And the deputy head of the group works for the CIA and brags about it, and works in Ukraine and aisles Hitler.
[00:51:40.627 --> 00:51:45.591]  So we are vindicated, just like we got ahead in the last few weeks of their attempt to roll out the new COVID control.
[00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:46.992]  We can do this again now.
[00:51:49.292 --> 00:51:52.555]  But again, they can't stop Trump, so they'll want to assassinate him.
[00:51:52.555 --> 00:51:54.677]  That's always historically the next step.
[00:51:54.677 --> 00:51:56.058]  Follow the graph.
[00:51:56.058 --> 00:51:56.979]  Biden's a liability.
[00:51:56.979 --> 00:51:57.819]  He won't step down.
[00:51:57.819 --> 00:51:59.401]  Jill won't step down.
[00:51:59.401 --> 00:52:01.663]  They want to turn a liability into a plus.
[00:52:01.663 --> 00:52:02.924]  I believe they'll assassinate him.
[00:52:02.924 --> 00:52:05.146]  And I don't want that to happen.
[00:52:05.146 --> 00:52:06.807]  And I don't want violence.
[00:52:06.807 --> 00:52:08.409]  And I don't endorse violence.
[00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:09.990]  We talk about a war on tyranny.
[00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.711]  It's cultural.
[00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:11.591]  It's spiritual.
[00:52:11.591 --> 00:52:13.133]  A war on Anheuser-Busch.
[00:52:13.133 --> 00:52:14.034]  It's pedophile crap.
[00:52:14.909 --> 00:52:16.550]  Does that mean we go attack Anheuser-Busch?
[00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.470]  We don't want to.
[00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:19.431]  Or the drivers that drive the beer around.
[00:52:19.431 --> 00:52:20.491]  They're innocent.
[00:52:20.491 --> 00:52:31.255]  But we destroy the lie of men invading women's spaces and women's sports and targeting children with these trainee pedophile people.
[00:52:31.255 --> 00:52:34.777]  But they say, oh, you say war against lies or info war.
[00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:37.318]  Yeah, information war is the answer.
[00:52:37.318 --> 00:52:42.100]  The truth is the antidote to the lies.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:42.860]  Look at these headlines.
[00:52:44.318 --> 00:52:54.127]  Good news, major federal court says no, Ivermectin works, you can't block it, and the FDA had no power to run around and try to stop that, keeping you from getting a therapeutic.
[00:52:54.127 --> 00:52:59.853]  New Yorkers told to mask up for Labor Day as new COVID variant sparks fears and drones are going to be watching them.
[00:52:59.853 --> 00:53:03.957]  Oh, but you can't watch the border, but you can sure as hell harass the people.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.421]  Major movie studios bring back the mask mandates.
[00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:12.881]  Public schools all over the country canceling class.
[00:53:12.881 --> 00:53:15.002]  Colleges say you gotta take the shot.
[00:53:15.002 --> 00:53:17.102]  Canceling class.
[00:53:17.102 --> 00:53:17.582]  As U.S.
[00:53:17.582 --> 00:53:19.903]  complications rise, will mask mandates return?
[00:53:19.903 --> 00:53:22.483]  NPR.
[00:53:22.483 --> 00:53:27.265]  Yes, they're trying to implement it now, but they don't want us to have a discussion about it.
[00:53:27.265 --> 00:53:29.805]  And they're also in damage control in the U.S.
[00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:33.066]  media, in the New Zealand media, the Australian media, the European media,
[00:53:34.085 --> 00:53:36.608]  Say, oh, nobody ever tried to make you wear a mask.
[00:53:36.608 --> 00:53:38.510]  Nobody ever tried to make you have a shot.
[00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:44.395]  I've got clip after clip, complained for hours, of here in the U.S.
[00:53:44.395 --> 00:53:47.419]  and all over the world saying, you take this shot or you're fired.
[00:53:47.419 --> 00:53:53.625]  They fired 70,000 health care workers in New York alone because they wouldn't take that experimentally legal shot.
[00:53:56.544 --> 00:54:02.895]  But that's why they want us censored, so when they tell new lies for old, we can't show them what they said before.
[00:54:02.895 --> 00:54:04.999]  That's what the censorship's about.
[00:54:04.999 --> 00:54:06.101]  It's election meddling.
[00:54:06.101 --> 00:54:07.423]  It's election theft.
[00:54:07.423 --> 00:54:08.045]  It's fraud.
[00:54:11.271 --> 00:54:13.433]  But I mentioned this earlier, so let's just play a few of these clips.
[00:54:13.433 --> 00:54:15.654]  I've got literally like 30 minutes of them.
[00:54:15.654 --> 00:54:23.400]  Here is Yvonne O'Hara, the head spokesperson for the WEF, saying, oh, the COVID lockdowns are a good test for things to come.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.741]  And then Sean Penn's saying the same thing.
[00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:27.863]  And then you read the documents, and I've got a whole stack up here.
[00:54:27.863 --> 00:54:34.688]  They say, no, Biden's set to announce a climate emergency and cut your resources off and tell you it's to save the earth.
[00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:36.509]  It's why you can't even get gasoline.
[00:54:36.509 --> 00:54:37.650]  What will that do to the economy?
[00:54:40.046 --> 00:54:41.888]  You're like, well, he won't get reelected, it hurts the economy.
[00:54:41.888 --> 00:54:45.711]  He doesn't care, folks, because they're cratering the nation.
[00:54:45.711 --> 00:54:46.992]  This is economic war.
[00:54:46.992 --> 00:54:48.133]  Here's that clip.
[00:54:48.133 --> 00:54:51.055]  You can stop all flights.
[00:54:51.055 --> 00:54:54.198]  You can lock down entire countries.
[00:54:54.198 --> 00:54:56.440]  You can actually do that.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:06.208]  And this, I would say, may make us more open to radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change.
[00:55:06.377 --> 00:55:11.062]  That will ultimately get us out of this mess with a vaccine.
[00:55:11.062 --> 00:55:17.810]  But this is also a kind of, you know, we're going to have to take the silver linings on this.
[00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:24.999]  This is a mandatory rehearsal for things to come that we are going to have to deal with as a society.
[00:55:27.805 --> 00:55:29.867]  This is an introduction of things to come.
[00:55:29.867 --> 00:55:32.129]  And what did the WEF say three years ago?
[00:55:32.129 --> 00:55:36.152]  They said, next are climate lockdowns on their website.
[00:55:36.152 --> 00:55:38.054]  Then they start promoting it and it trends.
[00:55:38.054 --> 00:55:38.955]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:55:38.955 --> 00:55:39.856]  He's psychic.
[00:55:39.856 --> 00:55:41.037]  They said they'd do it.
[00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:58.436]  And that's what's so frustrating is, we need all of Congress, we need the governors, everyone to say, no you're not cutting our pipelines off, no you're not shutting down our refineries that just keep blowing up and burning down, no you're not shutting down our farmland, no you're not getting rid of our cows, because they're already doing it in Europe, in the Netherlands, in Ireland.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.581]  You're like, well, that sounds crazy.
[00:56:00.581 --> 00:56:02.321]  It is crazy, folks.
[00:56:02.321 --> 00:56:08.665]  This is economic war because they think you'll forget in a few years why you're so poor and got to get a universal basic income from them.
[00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:10.225]  By the way, we got the clip to finally work.
[00:56:10.225 --> 00:56:11.366]  It's not our fault.
[00:56:11.366 --> 00:56:12.507]  Some weird thing with Internet clips.
[00:56:12.507 --> 00:56:13.407]  Sometimes they go on a computer.
[00:56:13.407 --> 00:56:14.328]  They won't work.
[00:56:14.328 --> 00:56:15.208]  Here's the clip of the guy.
[00:56:15.208 --> 00:56:16.509]  And I do this today.
[00:56:16.509 --> 00:56:17.429]  It's true.
[00:56:17.429 --> 00:56:19.990]  Asking Alexa, asking AI about the election.
[00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:21.931]  And this is what it's scraping.
[00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:24.172]  And AI tells you the most popular thing out there.
[00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:28.975]  It doesn't mean it's true, but this is the group knowledge that it's picking up.
[00:56:31.806 --> 00:56:38.372]  Hey, want to hear some... Alexa, who will win the next American election?
[00:56:38.372 --> 00:56:41.716]  The 2024 American election will not take place.
[00:56:41.716 --> 00:56:43.437]  There will be no winner.
[00:56:43.437 --> 00:56:50.985]  War Powers Resolution of 1973 or the War Powers Act will be invoked by the act of war with Russia and China.
[00:56:50.985 --> 00:56:54.368]  Once an invoke, the standing party will retain and remain in power.
[00:56:58.593 --> 00:57:10.986]  So, then they admit how Alexa works, just like Google AI, any of it, it goes and scrapes billions of things, or tens of billions of things a day, and then it aggregates it and tells you what the Oracle, the public, thinks is going to happen.
[00:57:10.986 --> 00:57:17.232]  So, it doesn't mean it's going to happen, it means the public thinks the most popular thing is there won't be a 2024 election.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.882]  And that you see him setting up all the parameters for it.
[00:57:21.882 --> 00:57:28.887]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is gracious enough to come in here with us on this Sunday night on her vacation visiting friends and family in Texas.
[00:57:28.887 --> 00:57:31.008]  And she's going to be with us for a full hour.
[00:57:31.008 --> 00:57:34.190]  Coming up we're going to have a special report in five minutes when we get her in the chair.
[00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.231]  We look forward to this coming up.
[00:57:35.231 --> 00:57:37.693]  Please tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:57:37.693 --> 00:57:39.954]  Let's ask MTG to tweet that she's coming on as well.
[00:57:39.954 --> 00:57:41.535]  Let's make sure she gets that link.
[00:57:41.535 --> 00:57:44.918]  And we look forward to her giving us her ideas on how to take this country back.
[00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:45.278]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:55.143]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[00:57:55.143 --> 00:58:04.687]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[00:58:04.687 --> 00:58:08.349]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:09.770]  We've got a limited shipment.
[00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:11.451]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[00:58:11.451 --> 00:58:17.534]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal,
[00:58:18.214 --> 00:58:20.936]  High quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer.

[00:59:52.252 --> 00:59:56.174]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:05.874 --> 01:00:16.162]  The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates with all of their sudden fear-mongering about the new variants that are coming.
[01:00:16.162 --> 01:00:23.788]  But to every COVID tyrant who wants to take away our freedom, hear these words, we will not comply.
[01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:24.509]  California
[01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:39.302]  And New York, two captured states on each end of the country, have officially rolled out new COVID protocols and mandates on their websites and said that indeed they're bringing back the controls.
[01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:44.486]  But we really caught them with their pants down almost two weeks ago with the whistleblower info.
[01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:46.528]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday.
[01:00:46.528 --> 01:00:51.372]  An individual was in town and they are a high level manager.
[01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:52.453]  What?
[01:01:19.386 --> 01:01:26.350]  People who have had the vaccine are more susceptible to B.A.2.A6.
[01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.551]  What the actual s***?
[01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:37.736]  But I was sent by the whistleblower a link to the California website and it says the controls are back and here they are, right there in black and white.
[01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:38.916]  They're gonna roll them out.
[01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:45.500]  And through the institutions, the corporations, the hospitals, the hotels, through the colleges, through the public schools,
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.143]  All over the country, they are shutting down public schools if there's one COVID case.
[01:01:51.143 --> 01:01:54.866]  That's creating the lockdown by sending the children back home.
[01:01:54.866 --> 01:01:56.367]  That's the beginning of it.
[01:01:56.367 --> 01:02:04.292]  My sources, because I called around and confirmed what the first source said, said middle of September, Biden is set to start the rollout.
[01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:06.574]  Now five, six days later,
[01:02:19.163 --> 01:02:24.445]  Joe Biden literally saying, y'all need to come, they need to come up with a new vaccine.
[01:02:24.445 --> 01:02:28.366]  And they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[01:02:28.366 --> 01:02:31.247]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.008]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:37.070]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this.
[01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:39.411]  Go around and find out.
[01:02:39.411 --> 01:02:43.814]  The FDA and CDC, they've made an announcement on the new vaccine.
[01:02:43.814 --> 01:02:50.039]  So certainly, they said that they will have an updated vaccine in September, mid-September.
[01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:51.780]  There never was a COVID pandemic.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.402]  There never was a SARS-CoV-2 novel virus.
[01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:55.703]  There was never any of those things.
[01:02:55.703 --> 01:03:05.170]  This was a behavior modification exercise to fulfill the objective of the financial interests that were being served.
[01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:05.991]  And let's remember,
[01:03:07.281 --> 01:03:20.352]  That the quote, until a pandemic is at emergency threshold, the public doesn't understand the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus or pan-influenced vaccine.
[01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:22.534]  We need the media to create the hype.
[01:03:23.194 --> 01:03:26.656]  We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.
[01:03:26.656 --> 01:03:30.378]  Investors will follow if they see profit at the end of the process.
[01:03:30.378 --> 01:03:31.759]  That's a quote from Peter Daszak.
[01:03:31.759 --> 01:03:36.882]  That's a quote that was made at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published in 2015.
[01:03:36.882 --> 01:03:40.645]  This is the admission of terrorism again.
[01:03:40.645 --> 01:03:42.406]  Now, what did I say they were told?
[01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:46.205]  The beginning of the announcements begin September 15th.
[01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:53.729]  This was just the warming up and getting ready that just so happened to begin right after I announced it literally six hours later.
[01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:54.249]  Everywhere.
[01:03:54.249 --> 01:04:00.533]  They just opened up on the public, every controlled corporate outlet, and then the institutions to create the fear.
[01:04:01.093 --> 01:04:04.036]  You can stop all flights.
[01:04:04.036 --> 01:04:07.178]  You can lock down entire countries.
[01:04:07.178 --> 01:04:09.400]  You can actually do that.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.064]  And this, I would say, may make us more open.
[01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:19.675]  Two radical ideas about how to deal also with climate change.
[01:04:19.675 --> 01:04:22.518]  This has nothing to do with public health.
[01:04:22.518 --> 01:04:25.421]  It has nothing to do with breaking any waves.
[01:04:25.421 --> 01:04:27.963]  It was always about breaking people.
[01:04:27.963 --> 01:04:32.468]  There's a path of resistance or there is the path of total enslavement.
[01:04:34.218 --> 01:04:35.398]  Come on.
[01:04:35.398 --> 01:04:38.799]  Your ancestors were stronger than this.
[01:04:38.799 --> 01:04:40.680]  You're stronger than this.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:50.982]  You can focus on the New World Order and its activities, and you can ask God to lead, guide, and direct you with discernment.
[01:04:50.982 --> 01:04:54.003]  And you do that, we're unstoppable together.
[01:05:00.228 --> 01:05:04.930]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:06.910]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.951]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:11.412]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:05:11.412 --> 01:05:12.232]  Hey, what's better?
[01:05:12.232 --> 01:05:13.092]  Knockout.
[01:05:13.092 --> 01:05:14.433]  What's better?
[01:05:14.433 --> 01:05:15.173]  Down and out.
[01:05:15.173 --> 01:05:15.693]  What's better?
[01:05:15.693 --> 01:05:17.954]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:05:17.954 --> 01:05:22.896]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:05:23.576 --> 01:05:27.560]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.881]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:30.182]  They're all very diverse.
[01:05:30.182 --> 01:05:40.371]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[01:05:41.112 --> 01:05:51.274]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep, and it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off, out of the gates.
[01:05:51.274 --> 01:06:04.676]  So get your InfoWars MD, good night's sleep today, at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:04.676 --> 01:06:08.257]  Fighting the good fight in the InfoWar, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.819 --> 01:06:24.842]  Fire all your guns at once!
[01:06:38.447 --> 01:06:40.448]  Well, she's firing all of her guns at once.
[01:06:40.448 --> 01:06:42.268]  The mighty MTG.
[01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:43.229]  And Texas is already 105.
[01:06:43.229 --> 01:06:46.270]  We don't need somebody as beautiful and amazing as her.
[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:47.610]  She clashes with the heat down here.
[01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.491]  This place is burning up now.
[01:06:49.491 --> 01:06:51.232]  It is so great to have you here.
[01:06:51.232 --> 01:06:52.973]  So great to be going to dinner tonight.
[01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:55.353]  And we got an hour with you, and you're just amazing.
[01:06:55.353 --> 01:06:56.274]  I want to talk about the Trump ad.
[01:06:57.034 --> 01:06:57.875]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:18.547 --> 01:07:20.207]  Thank you Alex, I really appreciate it.
[01:07:36.992 --> 01:07:38.733]  Social media so they can share it.
[01:07:38.733 --> 01:07:39.813]  Something they get behind.
[01:07:39.813 --> 01:07:41.294]  They all donate their money.
[01:07:41.294 --> 01:07:42.835]  They all get into the movement.
[01:07:42.835 --> 01:07:44.596]  We saw it happen with BLM.
[01:07:44.596 --> 01:07:46.036]  We saw it happen with COVID.
[01:07:46.036 --> 01:07:46.557]  Masks.
[01:07:46.557 --> 01:07:47.617]  Vaccines.
[01:07:47.617 --> 01:07:48.938]  We saw it happen with Ukraine.
[01:07:48.938 --> 01:07:50.338]  They tried it with monkey pox.
[01:07:50.338 --> 01:07:52.179]  We made fun of it and it failed.
[01:07:52.179 --> 01:07:54.140]  They're trying to bring COVID back.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:08:00.123]  But I really believe the next thing is going to be this climate change crisis.
[01:08:00.123 --> 01:08:01.904]  They're going to create it into an emergency.
[01:08:01.904 --> 01:08:04.145]  And Alex, I want to talk about Burning Man for a minute.
[01:08:04.805 --> 01:08:12.451]  We are watching, you know, from a distance, there are approximately like 73 or 75,000 people in Nevada.
[01:08:12.451 --> 01:08:14.032]  And they're locked in there from floods.
[01:08:14.032 --> 01:08:16.614]  And I'm glad, I was going to raise that.
[01:08:16.614 --> 01:08:22.418]  They literally did a mock sacrifice and all this and then it flooded with these tornadoes and it was, sorry, go ahead.
[01:08:22.418 --> 01:08:26.301]  Well, you know, God has a way of making sure everyone knows who God is.
[01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:27.522]  I'll say that about that.
[01:08:27.522 --> 01:08:30.364]  But let's talk about what is happening to these people.
[01:08:31.866 --> 01:08:37.027]  There's 73, 75,000 people in Nevada desert right now.
[01:08:37.027 --> 01:08:37.888]  They're locked in.
[01:08:37.888 --> 01:08:39.668]  They're not allowed to leave.
[01:08:39.668 --> 01:08:46.250]  And they're basically probably being brainwashed that climate change is the cause of all of it.
[01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.971]  It's the root of all evil.
[01:08:47.971 --> 01:08:49.371]  And it's going to destroy the earth.
[01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:51.151]  And they're feeling the panic.
[01:08:51.151 --> 01:08:52.192]  The media is saying that.
[01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:56.175]  Yes, so what's going to happen, Alex?
[01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:59.398]  It's the same way they launch any kind of movement.
[01:08:59.398 --> 01:09:11.770]  After this is over and Burning Man and these 75,000 people disperse and they go back home, they're going to have these stories to tell and how terrible it is and how we have to do everything possible to stop climate change.
[01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.072]  It's caused by humans and it's carbon.
[01:09:14.673 --> 01:09:16.515]  And it's the amount of carbon that we put out.
[01:09:16.515 --> 01:09:17.956]  It's manufacturing.
[01:09:17.956 --> 01:09:20.658]  It's our gas and diesel engines.
[01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:22.680]  It's, you know, agriculture.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.303]  I mean, AOC wants to get rid of cattle.
[01:09:25.303 --> 01:09:26.444]  Even population.
[01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:29.366]  We have too many humans putting out too much carbon.
[01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:32.189]  You're going to start hearing all this stuff and this is going to build.
[01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:46.761]  And I believe this is the left's new lie they're going to put on the American people and try to get everyone behind and create it to where, remember AOC and the left and many others said that the earth is going to literally explode in a ball of fire.
[01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:47.602]  We're going to all die.
[01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:49.503]  It's going to be the end of the world.
[01:09:49.503 --> 01:09:49.543]  2030.
[01:09:49.543 --> 01:09:51.705]  This is what they're brainwashing people to believe.
[01:09:51.705 --> 01:09:52.506]  No, I totally agree.
[01:09:52.506 --> 01:09:55.788]  And now Biden says he's set to announce a new climate emergency.
[01:09:55.788 --> 01:09:58.711]  The Klaus Schwab said three years ago they do after COVID.
[01:09:58.711 --> 01:10:01.133]  So they literally cut our resources off and make it fancy.
[01:10:01.704 --> 01:10:03.485]  Well, let's be realistic though.
[01:10:03.485 --> 01:10:05.185]  Yes, the climate changes.
[01:10:05.185 --> 01:10:08.647]  It's been changing since the beginning of time.
[01:10:08.647 --> 01:10:11.828]  Since God created the earth, the climate has changed.
[01:10:11.828 --> 01:10:19.051]  And that is the reality because we live on our planet is moving, it's rotating, it's moving through our air.
[01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:20.332]  The only constant is change.
[01:10:20.772 --> 01:10:22.693]  It always changes.
[01:10:22.693 --> 01:10:24.094]  It rotates around the sun.
[01:10:24.094 --> 01:10:25.495]  It moves through the galaxy.
[01:10:25.495 --> 01:10:28.076]  Our galaxy rotates through the universe.
[01:10:28.076 --> 01:10:31.738]  Of course our climate is going to change.
[01:10:31.738 --> 01:10:33.459]  But does that mean people are causing it?
[01:10:33.459 --> 01:10:33.979]  No.
[01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:37.001]  Does that mean we have to raise taxes to stop it?
[01:10:37.001 --> 01:10:38.101]  No, absolutely not.
[01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:41.403]  Does that mean we have to bow down to a globalist government?
[01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:42.064]  Absolutely not.
[01:10:42.064 --> 01:10:44.045]  As if they can stop it anyways.
[01:10:44.045 --> 01:10:45.305]  They can't stop it.
[01:10:45.305 --> 01:10:47.226]  It's all the sun, as you said.
[01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:50.409]  What's happening in Congress?
[01:10:50.409 --> 01:10:53.132]  Because I know we're getting close to impeachment movements.
[01:10:53.132 --> 01:11:04.025]  We know Biden's a puppet, but still we need to get them on the defense because that ties into these insane indictments of Trump, which even Donna Brazile admits has totally blown up in their face.
[01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:15.754]  Well, so day one, when I entered Congress in January of 2021, on Joe Biden's first day in office, I introduced articles of impeachment.
[01:11:15.754 --> 01:11:22.596]  And I introduced those against Joe Biden because of Ukraine, because of Burisma, because we knew the truth.
[01:11:22.596 --> 01:11:23.857]  We knew the truth a long time ago.
[01:11:24.497 --> 01:11:26.519]  And I introduced those articles of impeachment.
[01:11:26.519 --> 01:11:31.722]  This has been a movement I have been pushing since the time I came into Congress.
[01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:34.144]  This is why they kicked me off committees.
[01:11:34.144 --> 01:11:37.787]  This is why they tried to politically destroy me.
[01:11:37.787 --> 01:11:43.331]  But finally, through our oversight investigations, I'm on the oversight committee, we have been investigating Joe Biden.
[01:11:43.871 --> 01:12:05.285]  Since the beginning of this Congress and the amount of evidence we have produced has become so overwhelming now that even our Republicans in Congress that don't want to have anything to do with impeachment, they are now, we believe, I believe, we have enough votes to vote for impeachment inquiry when we go back here next week in September.
[01:12:05.865 --> 01:12:06.265]  Amazing.
[01:12:06.265 --> 01:12:07.526]  Elaborate on that.
[01:12:07.526 --> 01:12:09.727]  What about Impeachment of Merritt Garland?
[01:12:09.727 --> 01:12:10.988]  These people are a joke.
[01:12:10.988 --> 01:12:13.929]  And you've got Jack Smith meeting secretly at the White House?
[01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:14.450]  That's right.
[01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:19.372]  So if everyone wants to know more information, you can go to impeachmentteam.com.
[01:12:19.372 --> 01:12:24.795]  By the way, I want to hear a record skip sound right now in everybody's mind.
[01:12:24.795 --> 01:12:27.777]  Slowly give us out, because you're on the field.
[01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:29.158]  You're a champion in the fight.
[01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.439]  You are quarterbacking this.
[01:12:31.439 --> 01:12:32.240]  You're getting this done.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.241]  You promised this months ago.
[01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:35.262]  It's happening now.
[01:12:35.262 --> 01:12:36.643]  People need to go to this site.
[01:12:36.643 --> 01:12:37.324]  They need to tweet it.
[01:12:37.324 --> 01:12:38.244]  They need to share it.
[01:12:38.244 --> 01:12:39.045]  They need to get behind it.
[01:12:39.045 --> 01:12:40.166]  So explain this to us.
[01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:43.068]  Okay, so I've introduced articles of impeachment on Joe Biden.
[01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:45.730]  I've introduced articles of impeachment on Merrick Garland.
[01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:52.055]  I've introduced articles of impeachment on Christopher Wray, Matthew Graves, who persecutes January 6th defendants.
[01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:56.717]  Pro-life protesters, parents who hold their school board accountable.
[01:12:56.717 --> 01:13:02.741]  That's Matthew Graves and I've introduced articles of impeachment against Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
[01:13:02.741 --> 01:13:04.121]  Here's what's happening.
[01:13:04.121 --> 01:13:07.483]  The amount of evidence, Alex, is becoming so overwhelming.
[01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:10.285]  Just like, here let me say this, this is really important.
[01:13:10.965 --> 01:13:19.912]  Just like we can truly say, at least I can truly say, I believe the Great Awakening is occurring because of truth.
[01:13:19.912 --> 01:13:24.355]  People all over are waking up and God is dividing people by the sheep and goats.
[01:13:24.355 --> 01:13:25.916]  He is literally dividing us.
[01:13:25.916 --> 01:13:30.079]  There's people that can't hear the truth right now and then there's people that are waking up over and over.
[01:13:30.079 --> 01:13:31.841]  The amount of truth that is basically
[01:13:34.383 --> 01:13:41.107]  Just coming out throughout Congress is forcing the will of Congress, forcing the will of Republicans.
[01:13:41.107 --> 01:13:45.250]  Republicans that wouldn't act before are now becoming willing to act.
[01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:50.634]  And so I have a lot of encouragement and hope where we are going forward.
[01:13:50.634 --> 01:13:58.900]  But at the same time, I caution people at home to please have patience, even though that's the hardest thing to have, because I feel the same way as you do.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.442]  I want impeachment now and I want it on all these people.
[01:14:02.102 --> 01:14:04.985]  But what we have to do is we have to continue to push.
[01:14:04.985 --> 01:14:06.286]  So here's the good thing.
[01:14:06.286 --> 01:14:11.531]  All of my colleagues that I work with, they've been at home in their districts and they've had to hear from their constituents.
[01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:14.874]  They've had to hear from the voters that sent them to Washington.
[01:14:14.874 --> 01:14:17.297]  And I hope to God they have been yelling at them.
[01:14:17.297 --> 01:14:18.178]  And you said that buzzword.
[01:14:18.178 --> 01:14:19.979]  You said, we've got McCarthy about to do it.
[01:14:19.979 --> 01:14:21.141]  He says now they're moving there.
[01:14:21.141 --> 01:14:22.222]  He said he's ready.
[01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:23.082]  So you delivered again.
[01:14:23.857 --> 01:14:24.398]  Thank you.
[01:14:24.398 --> 01:14:25.639]  I appreciate that.
[01:14:25.639 --> 01:14:26.600]  In a way, I get the point.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.024]  You've got to ripen it and have the investigations to show it all to make sure you have the votes.
[01:14:31.024 --> 01:14:31.324]  Right.
[01:14:31.324 --> 01:14:32.926]  So here's the process.
[01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:35.848]  Let's explain it out in detail so everyone knows.
[01:14:35.848 --> 01:14:39.932]  In the House of Representatives, we have 435 members of Congress.
[01:14:39.932 --> 01:14:40.813]  Let's be clear.
[01:14:40.813 --> 01:14:46.559]  In our system of three branches, federalism is done to make it slow so a dictator can take control.
[01:14:46.559 --> 01:14:47.379]  So people get frustrated.
[01:14:47.379 --> 01:14:48.981]  It takes time, but that's how our system works.
[01:14:49.221 --> 01:14:49.861]  Absolutely.
[01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:52.963]  We don't want it fast, because imagine if it was flipped the other way.
[01:14:52.963 --> 01:14:54.144]  We've already seen that.
[01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:59.287]  They impeached Trump twice by abusing the system and abusing power.
[01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:00.528]  So 435 members of Congress.
[01:15:00.528 --> 01:15:01.388]  We have 222 Republican members.
[01:15:01.388 --> 01:15:01.508]  Only 222.
[01:15:01.508 --> 01:15:05.290]  We have to have 218 yes votes to do anything in the House of Representatives.
[01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:06.371]  Without 218, we fail on every day.
[01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:07.972]  So you've got to overwhelmingly nail it?
[01:15:18.698 --> 01:15:22.460]  We have to overwhelmingly now and here's Kevin McCarthy has been there.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:23.661]  He's already been there.
[01:15:23.661 --> 01:15:25.402]  He has spent time.
[01:15:25.402 --> 01:15:28.183]  Our oversight committee has spent time.
[01:15:28.183 --> 01:15:29.564]  Judiciary has spent time.
[01:15:29.564 --> 01:15:37.468]  Ways and Means Committee has spent time producing evidence, investigating evidence and showing it through our committee work.
[01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:52.514]  So that we can not only show the American people, we can also show all of our colleagues, everyone in Congress, to convince them, look, we have the evidence right now, not to impeach, literally just to ask the question.
[01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:54.935]  That's what an impeachment inquiry is.
[01:15:54.935 --> 01:15:56.536]  Can we just ask the question?
[01:15:56.536 --> 01:16:00.878]  Are we willing to say, can we peek and look for more evidence?
[01:16:00.878 --> 01:16:02.258]  May we go further.
[01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:06.420]  May we, as Congress, the United States House of Representatives,
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.640]  Open an investigation.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.201]  And every day we learn more.
[01:16:10.201 --> 01:16:12.322]  Every day we learn more and you will learn more.
[01:16:12.322 --> 01:16:15.082]  You would not believe how much more there is to learn.
[01:16:15.082 --> 01:16:21.624]  And we are finally at the point I can confidently say, when we go back, we will vote for an impeachment inquiry.
[01:16:21.624 --> 01:16:27.506]  And Alex, I've said, if we can't do it, I cannot vote to fund this corrupt
[01:16:28.306 --> 01:16:34.034]  Completely out of control, over bloated, 32 trillion dollar government that is in debt.
[01:16:34.034 --> 01:16:35.175]  In debt by that much money.
[01:16:35.175 --> 01:16:40.783]  I can't do it if we are not willing to even ask the question for an impeachment inquiry.
[01:16:40.783 --> 01:16:41.264]  Beautiful.
[01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:44.208]  So what do the listeners do to make sure this gets accelerated?
[01:16:45.236 --> 01:16:47.297]  Call your representative.
[01:16:47.297 --> 01:16:49.118]  You don't have to call my office.
[01:16:49.118 --> 01:16:53.800]  I've been there since Joe Biden's first day in office.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.180]  Call the other representatives.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.921]  Call all of my colleagues.
[01:16:56.921 --> 01:17:00.483]  Call Democrats and Republicans and tell them you demand it.
[01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:01.883]  Tell them you demand it.
[01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:04.165]  And that's what needs to happen.
[01:17:04.165 --> 01:17:04.865]  Shifting gears.
[01:17:06.075 --> 01:17:07.336]  Wargaming the enemy.
[01:17:07.336 --> 01:17:10.777]  These indictments against Trump have made him, you know, I played the clip before he came on.
[01:17:10.777 --> 01:17:13.218]  Donna Brazile says, this is bigger than Obama.
[01:17:13.218 --> 01:17:14.298]  It's unstoppable.
[01:17:14.298 --> 01:17:15.059]  It's not working.
[01:17:15.059 --> 01:17:16.119]  What are we going to do?
[01:17:16.119 --> 01:17:20.081]  They're hitting the panic button, which I kind of don't want because I want them to be arrogant.
[01:17:20.081 --> 01:17:20.781]  Instead, they're not.
[01:17:20.781 --> 01:17:22.622]  They're like, well, we're screwed.
[01:17:22.622 --> 01:17:24.983]  Looking at all the moving pieces here, I know you know Trump well.
[01:17:24.983 --> 01:17:25.783]  How is he doing?
[01:17:25.783 --> 01:17:27.424]  What are we going to do to support Trump?
[01:17:27.424 --> 01:17:28.284]  Where do you see this going?
[01:17:29.116 --> 01:17:32.877]  Oh, I see this getting a lot uglier and a lot worse before it ever gets better.
[01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:36.979]  As a matter of fact, I'm expecting... I don't know what I'm expecting.
[01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:39.000]  I'm expecting anything at this point.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.720]  I don't even know.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:45.582]  We may see a point where they literally put him in jail and do not allow him out until the election.
[01:17:46.002 --> 01:17:50.303]  I expect anything from the Democrats because they have no way to win.
[01:17:50.303 --> 01:17:51.004]  You want to know why?
[01:17:51.004 --> 01:17:51.784]  They're cornered.
[01:17:51.784 --> 01:17:53.364]  Oh, they're cornered!
[01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:54.845]  They've ripped open our border.
[01:17:54.845 --> 01:18:01.547]  They are successfully partnering with the Mexican cartels in the biggest human trafficking operation in history.
[01:18:01.547 --> 01:18:04.868]  Even I said last week, the border in Texas is now run by the cartels.
[01:18:07.109 --> 01:18:07.950]  It is.
[01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:08.770]  I'll tell you why.
[01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:21.217]  We had the Border Patrol Chief tell us in our Homeland Committee hearing just earlier this year, he said that five out of nine of the border sectors are under the control of the cartels.
[01:18:21.217 --> 01:18:22.498]  Five out of nine.
[01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:24.639]  And again, the feds are such control freaks.
[01:18:24.639 --> 01:18:29.862]  They've given the Mexican cartels that have basically overthrown the Mexican government operational control.
[01:18:29.862 --> 01:18:30.823]  That is insane.
[01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:33.164]  They didn't give it to him.
[01:18:33.164 --> 01:18:35.425]  Well, the Biden administration gave it to him.
[01:18:35.425 --> 01:18:35.965]  Well, they greenlit it.
[01:18:35.965 --> 01:18:36.726]  They moved out of the way.
[01:18:36.726 --> 01:18:38.646]  Yes, yeah, we're not blaming Border Patrol.
[01:18:38.646 --> 01:18:40.707]  That's just happened with policies.
[01:18:40.707 --> 01:18:43.028]  So, yes, our border's out of control.
[01:18:43.028 --> 01:18:44.069]  Bidenomics.
[01:18:44.069 --> 01:18:47.631]  Best thing they could have ever done is by naming it Bidenomics.
[01:18:47.631 --> 01:18:49.832]  Now we have a name for it and we'll never forget it.
[01:18:49.832 --> 01:18:51.832]  Worst inflation in 40 years.
[01:18:51.832 --> 01:18:55.274]  Senior citizens can hardly pay their bills.
[01:18:55.274 --> 01:18:57.235]  Single mothers, hardworking people.
[01:18:57.295 --> 01:18:59.636]  I have a bunch of family that have degrees that are professionals.
[01:18:59.636 --> 01:19:00.537]  They can't pay their bills.
[01:19:00.537 --> 01:19:00.997]  No.
[01:19:00.997 --> 01:19:01.957]  Imagine the poor people.
[01:19:01.957 --> 01:19:02.497]  I mean.
[01:19:02.497 --> 01:19:03.238]  It's awful.
[01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:06.779]  People are maxing out their credit cards just to get by month after month.
[01:19:06.779 --> 01:19:08.520]  Grocery bills have doubled.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.781]  This is what Joe Biden's policies have done.
[01:19:10.781 --> 01:19:12.622]  This is what they've done.
[01:19:12.622 --> 01:19:15.304]  And I know you pointed this out when you saw it in my stack.
[01:19:15.304 --> 01:19:15.884]  It's viral.
[01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.705]  Black folks are pissed.
[01:19:17.705 --> 01:19:18.845]  This man.
[01:19:18.845 --> 01:19:20.106]  This man right here.
[01:19:21.377 --> 01:19:23.878]  This man, I watched his video.
[01:19:23.878 --> 01:19:25.618]  I watched it like eight times.
[01:19:25.618 --> 01:19:26.658]  It was the best thing.
[01:19:26.658 --> 01:19:28.459]  It was the best video there is.
[01:19:28.459 --> 01:19:30.959]  If you haven't seen it, I encourage you to watch it.
[01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:34.640]  What he said is he literally spoke for Joe Rogan.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.000]  He spoke for me.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.780]  He spoke for me.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.561]  He spoke for everyone I know.
[01:19:38.561 --> 01:19:41.161]  And he laid down the law.
[01:19:41.161 --> 01:19:42.942]  And I will go further with that.
[01:19:42.942 --> 01:19:46.543]  I serve on the COVID Select Committee.
[01:19:46.543 --> 01:19:47.823]  Here's where I stand with this.
[01:19:49.223 --> 01:19:52.144]  There is not going to be lockdowns with COVID.
[01:19:52.144 --> 01:19:54.045]  There will be no forced masking.
[01:19:54.045 --> 01:19:57.166]  There will be no forced vaccines.
[01:19:57.166 --> 01:20:00.007]  That is one of the red lines I have drawn in the sand.
[01:20:00.007 --> 01:20:01.088]  I've drawn three.
[01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:07.930]  Weaponized government, COVID mask and vaccines and funding for more COVID, and Ukraine.
[01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:09.071]  Those are my three.
[01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:12.752]  I will not vote for any appropriation bill that does those things.
[01:20:12.752 --> 01:20:16.073]  I will not vote for a short-term CR that does those things.
[01:20:16.073 --> 01:20:17.634]  And how amazing, though,
[01:20:18.646 --> 01:20:21.127]  It has been them trying to roll it out again.
[01:20:21.127 --> 01:20:23.529]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:20:23.529 --> 01:20:24.289]  They're losing.
[01:20:24.289 --> 01:20:27.611]  They need things to distract people, to suck them into fear.
[01:20:27.611 --> 01:20:29.752]  That's why they need the climate change crisis.
[01:20:29.752 --> 01:20:32.514]  That's why they want climate activists and protesters.
[01:20:32.514 --> 01:20:34.455]  They're going to be rioters, just wait.
[01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:35.676]  Then we may have lockdowns.
[01:20:35.676 --> 01:20:37.136]  They're blocking roads and everything.
[01:20:37.136 --> 01:20:37.897]  Of course they are!
[01:20:38.337 --> 01:20:42.720]  Then we're going to have more COVID to increase mass hysteria and fear.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.422]  They need people distracted, and I'll go back to why.
[01:20:45.422 --> 01:20:46.863]  The border's wide open.
[01:20:46.863 --> 01:20:51.407]  Bidenomics is destroying people's ability to pay their bills.
[01:20:51.407 --> 01:20:54.929]  They're putting us into a war that may lead to World War III.
[01:20:54.929 --> 01:20:58.152]  They cannot win on these policies.
[01:20:58.152 --> 01:21:06.698]  They're locking up their top political opponent, President Trump, who we remember four years with President Trump as some of the greatest years in American history.
[01:21:06.698 --> 01:21:09.543]  The head of the DNC says this isn't working.
[01:21:09.543 --> 01:21:10.866]  What did they think was going to happen?
[01:21:12.765 --> 01:21:15.808]  Well, they did a good job with elections before.
[01:21:15.808 --> 01:21:18.430]  We know, we understand that.
[01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:22.873]  But I truly, I truly see this as they, they're so arrogant.
[01:21:22.873 --> 01:21:25.115]  Really, Alex, they're so arrogant.
[01:21:25.115 --> 01:21:41.488]  They really believe that their policies are the best, that they know what they're doing, and that these little stupid peons and the uneducated people of America, you know, the deplorables, as they called us once before, that they, that we don't know what we're doing, that they know better than us.
[01:21:42.389 --> 01:21:46.611]  And that they can just win, and that they'll just- And Marjorie Taylor Greene, that's the key.
[01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:51.212]  The Black Rocks know it's to create an angrier world, destroy things, and consolidate power.
[01:21:51.212 --> 01:21:51.813]  But you're right.
[01:21:51.813 --> 01:21:58.175]  The Democrats actually believe they're creating a utopia, and they're being given marching orders that are going to destroy everything.
[01:21:58.175 --> 01:21:58.415]  They are.
[01:21:58.415 --> 01:21:59.956]  Well, they're definitely doing that.
[01:21:59.956 --> 01:22:03.017]  They're leading us down to a road of destruction.
[01:22:03.017 --> 01:22:05.258]  But I'm telling you, Alex, people are waking up.
[01:22:05.678 --> 01:22:06.699]  It's the most incredible thing.
[01:22:20.555 --> 01:22:26.637]  It's wonderful because people know and they're suffering under the Biden administration or the Biden regime.
[01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:27.778]  They've already been fooled.
[01:22:27.778 --> 01:22:33.060]  People that really bought into COVID, they have come out of this thing so upset and angry.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.580]  Like, I can't believe I got these vaccines.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.701]  They didn't even work.
[01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.802]  I can't believe I wore a mask all the time.
[01:22:37.802 --> 01:22:38.522]  That didn't help me.
[01:22:38.522 --> 01:22:40.163]  It didn't stop the spread of COVID.
[01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:44.164]  People that are coming out of this are coming out and they're waking up.
[01:22:44.164 --> 01:22:46.025]  And so they have no desire to go back.
[01:22:46.385 --> 01:22:51.914]  They're also realizing that, oh, maybe there's some truth to this Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:22:51.914 --> 01:22:52.616]  Oh, shoot.
[01:22:52.616 --> 01:22:55.120]  Maybe Joe Biden has been doing that.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.145]  They see Maui really pissed people off.
[01:22:58.621 --> 01:22:59.961]  It should piss people off.
[01:22:59.961 --> 01:23:01.422]  Lahaina was a wonderful town.
[01:23:01.422 --> 01:23:02.462]  I've been there many times.
[01:23:02.462 --> 01:23:03.162]  Me too.
[01:23:03.162 --> 01:23:08.603]  Yeah, it was one of the best places to go visit in Maui.
[01:23:08.603 --> 01:23:13.324]  My daughter spent nearly every summer out there for like eight years.
[01:23:13.324 --> 01:23:14.744]  The people there are wonderful.
[01:23:14.744 --> 01:23:18.705]  It just was a great community.
[01:23:18.705 --> 01:23:24.026]  And Biden, he said about the train deal, Roman, he said he's too busy to go there.
[01:23:24.026 --> 01:23:24.666]  We have that club.
[01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:26.726]  Just too busy to go.
[01:23:26.726 --> 01:23:27.687]  Too busy to go.
[01:23:27.687 --> 01:23:30.648]  Well, you know, Joe Biden, it's amazing.
[01:23:30.648 --> 01:23:38.690]  He wants $24 billion more dollars for Ukraine, but wants to give a $700 one-time payment to the people of Lahaina that lost everything.
[01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:43.872]  Then when he did go talk to him, he talked about how his kitchen fire and experience there is if somehow...
[01:23:44.372 --> 01:23:46.793]  That was comparable to what they went through.
[01:23:46.793 --> 01:23:47.953]  They lost everything.
[01:23:47.953 --> 01:23:49.193]  They can't even find neighbors.
[01:23:49.193 --> 01:23:50.854]  They can't find kids.
[01:23:50.854 --> 01:23:52.294]  Their livelihoods are gone.
[01:23:52.294 --> 01:23:53.654]  Their homes are gone.
[01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:56.715]  But yet he hasn't gone to visit East Palestine.
[01:23:56.715 --> 01:23:58.775]  He hasn't gone to the border.
[01:23:58.775 --> 01:24:03.097]  But you better bet he's been over to Ukraine to see Zelensky countless times.
[01:24:03.097 --> 01:24:06.997]  And he's set his ass on the beach in Delaware I don't know how many times.
[01:24:06.997 --> 01:24:08.998]  I think that 44% of the time he's on vacation.
[01:24:09.338 --> 01:24:10.799]  Yeah, that's a lot of vacation time.
[01:24:10.799 --> 01:24:20.162]  You know, if you work Monday through Friday, if you work Monday through Friday, that's about 26, that gives you about 26% of the year vacation time.
[01:24:20.162 --> 01:24:20.682]  Think about that.
[01:24:20.682 --> 01:24:26.004]  If you work Monday through Friday all year long, then you, Saturday and Sunday, Saturday and Sunday is vacation.
[01:24:26.004 --> 01:24:27.965]  So that's about 26% of the year.
[01:24:27.965 --> 01:24:30.726]  But Joe Biden has spent over 40%, 40, 44%.
[01:24:30.726 --> 01:24:33.407]  It's incredible.
[01:24:33.407 --> 01:24:37.028]  Well, he's also, he's too old to serve.
[01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:38.169]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:24:39.429 --> 01:24:40.910]  What are they going to do about him?
[01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.731]  I mean, they got Newsom kind of getting warmed up.
[01:24:42.731 --> 01:24:45.132]  They got Big Mike.
[01:24:45.132 --> 01:24:47.093]  I'm not sure, actually.
[01:24:47.093 --> 01:24:50.856]  Oh, Big Mike's got you laughing.
[01:24:50.856 --> 01:24:51.856]  Yeah.
[01:24:51.856 --> 01:24:54.378]  I tell you what, they're going to save her.
[01:24:54.378 --> 01:24:58.780]  If it's a real emergency, we'll definitely see her come out.
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.301]  They're going to break in case of emergency.
[01:25:00.301 --> 01:25:01.221]  Exactly.
[01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:01.882]  She's in a case.
[01:25:02.902 --> 01:25:04.603]  She's in a case.
[01:25:04.603 --> 01:25:05.283]  She is there.
[01:25:05.283 --> 01:25:08.704]  That's when everything is failing.
[01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.925]  Donald Trump's going to win.
[01:25:10.925 --> 01:25:13.086]  Joe Biden is a corrupt criminal.
[01:25:13.086 --> 01:25:14.186]  No one can deny it.
[01:25:14.186 --> 01:25:17.327]  Gavin Newsom can't win because he destroyed California.
[01:25:17.327 --> 01:25:18.467]  They're going to run over there.
[01:25:18.467 --> 01:25:22.249]  They're going to pull the hammer, break the glass, and they're going to pull her out.
[01:25:22.249 --> 01:25:24.029]  Do you think Big Mike's handsome, ma'am?
[01:25:24.029 --> 01:25:25.510]  I'm not going to get in trouble.
[01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.910]  I'm going to stop.
[01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:32.427]  Well, you know, Joan Rivers might have said things that could... Yeah.
[01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:33.188]  Wow, keep going!
[01:25:33.188 --> 01:25:36.271]  Man, MTG, I love her.
[01:25:36.271 --> 01:25:48.863]  Yeah, no, really though, that would be... I don't think she wants to run, I don't think, but we know Obama would love it, and actually that'd be their only way to keep going, and I think... Isn't this pretty much the third administration of Biden?
[01:25:48.863 --> 01:25:49.944]  Oh, this is totally the third.
[01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:50.144]  Or Obama?
[01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.466]  It's totally the third term.
[01:25:52.006 --> 01:25:52.606]  Absolutely.
[01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:53.186]  It's the third term.
[01:25:53.186 --> 01:25:56.427]  They've got all the same people back in there.
[01:25:56.427 --> 01:26:00.568]  They're running everything just as if they never skipped a beat.
[01:26:00.568 --> 01:26:03.829]  President Trump was like a speed bump for them.
[01:26:03.829 --> 01:26:08.470]  They went right back to it, pursuing everything they were trying to pursue before.
[01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:11.091]  And they want to continue that process.
[01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:12.491]  And that's where we're at.
[01:26:12.491 --> 01:26:16.432]  And yeah, Michelle Obama, she's definitely the one that will try to save the day.
[01:26:17.521 --> 01:26:19.504]  Roger Stone talks to Trump every day.
[01:26:19.504 --> 01:26:21.407]  He says the guy's got ice water.
[01:26:21.407 --> 01:26:24.031]  He says he's known him 40-something years.
[01:26:24.031 --> 01:26:25.934]  He says Trump's on cloud nine.
[01:26:25.934 --> 01:26:26.675]  What is your view?
[01:26:26.675 --> 01:26:27.857]  You talk to Trump a lot.
[01:26:27.857 --> 01:26:28.799]  This guy's incredible.
[01:26:30.182 --> 01:26:31.602]  President Trump is remarkable.
[01:26:31.602 --> 01:26:40.085]  I think, I talk to him a lot and I think what I can explain to people is, number one, he is such a real person.
[01:26:40.085 --> 01:26:42.945]  Every time I talk to him he always asks me, how are you doing Marjorie?
[01:26:42.945 --> 01:26:44.646]  He genuinely will ask about me.
[01:26:44.646 --> 01:26:47.546]  He called me and my wife on our honeymoon seven years ago.
[01:26:47.546 --> 01:26:48.527]  How did you even know this was happening?
[01:26:48.527 --> 01:26:49.227]  Isn't that great?
[01:26:49.927 --> 01:26:52.228]  That's the kind of man he is though.
[01:26:52.228 --> 01:26:56.591]  And I, one thing that all, or there's several things that impressed me.
[01:26:56.591 --> 01:27:03.114]  One of them is the fact that he is such a successful businessman for so many years.
[01:27:03.114 --> 01:27:06.836]  And there, there is no PhD that equals that.
[01:27:06.836 --> 01:27:08.617]  There is no education.
[01:27:08.617 --> 01:27:11.338]  There is nothing that... You're a successful businesswoman.
[01:27:11.338 --> 01:27:12.779]  You know that's the real streets.
[01:27:12.779 --> 01:27:13.499]  It is.
[01:27:13.499 --> 01:27:14.760]  That is it.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.281]  If you can provide... That's why you're so successful.
[01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:18.182]  You never talk about it, but you've been very successful.
[01:27:18.917 --> 01:27:21.218]  I have, and it takes hard work to be there.
[01:27:21.218 --> 01:27:23.979]  It takes a lot of hard work to get there, but you learn.
[01:27:23.979 --> 01:27:29.102]  You learn real lessons that you cannot learn with any college or university.
[01:27:29.102 --> 01:27:32.043]  There is no master's degree or PhD program.
[01:27:32.043 --> 01:27:33.664]  You learn to spot BS quick.
[01:27:33.664 --> 01:27:33.924]  Right.
[01:27:34.424 --> 01:27:37.547]  And so, President Trump has that.
[01:27:37.547 --> 01:27:38.808]  That's how I view government.
[01:27:38.808 --> 01:27:42.211]  My job in government, I only look at it with a business lens.
[01:27:42.211 --> 01:27:44.833]  And President Trump sees it the same way.
[01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:51.859]  The other thing I really appreciate about President Trump is the fact that he plays golf every day makes him extremely healthy.
[01:27:51.859 --> 01:27:53.260]  You know, I work out a lot.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.802]  That's something that I'm dedicated to.
[01:27:56.683 --> 01:27:57.744]  Thank you.
[01:27:57.744 --> 01:28:01.427]  But health and fitness helps your mental capacity.
[01:28:01.427 --> 01:28:03.429]  It keeps you sharp.
[01:28:03.429 --> 01:28:10.916]  There's a whole, just everything around it between your health, your fitness, your mental capacity.
[01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:13.378]  So he's stronger, would you say he's stronger now under attack?
[01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:16.700]  I would say he is extremely strong.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.462]  Because Brazil said, oh my God, this is a Nietzschean.
[01:28:19.462 --> 01:28:21.403]  She said, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[01:28:21.403 --> 01:28:22.124]  They're scared.
[01:28:22.124 --> 01:28:22.844]  Don't you get it?
[01:28:22.844 --> 01:28:24.706]  You're in a game of chicken with us.
[01:28:24.706 --> 01:28:27.628]  They should be scared, because I rode down those same streets.
[01:28:27.628 --> 01:28:28.709]  I went to the Atlanta jail.
[01:28:29.369 --> 01:28:33.332]  And I rode down there, down Rice Street, and I saw all the people coming out.
[01:28:33.332 --> 01:28:35.534]  And they were out on the side of the road screaming.
[01:28:35.534 --> 01:28:36.495]  Let's talk about that.
[01:28:36.495 --> 01:28:38.836]  And guys, since she mentioned it, I think the clip's in there.
[01:28:38.836 --> 01:28:39.977]  Make sure we bleep it.
[01:28:39.977 --> 01:28:41.118]  This guy's on fire.
[01:28:41.118 --> 01:28:46.923]  This great American, uh, this great American black man, uh, I mean, Joe Rogan sent me this like three days ago.
[01:28:46.923 --> 01:28:47.423]  This is gone.
[01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:48.043]  I'm not name-dropping.
[01:28:48.043 --> 01:28:50.125]  It's just, that's, that's how viral this is.
[01:28:50.125 --> 01:28:51.546]  We're gonna come back, play this.
[01:28:51.546 --> 01:28:54.008]  MTG is in the house.
[01:28:54.008 --> 01:28:55.990]  We'll give you the URL, too, to get behind the impeachment.
[01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.390]  Straight ahead.
[01:28:58.635 --> 01:29:03.357]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store, or like a vitamin shop.
[01:29:03.357 --> 01:29:05.318]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:29:05.318 --> 01:29:07.378]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:29:07.378 --> 01:29:09.839]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:29:09.839 --> 01:29:10.660]  Hey, what's better?
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.500]  Knockout?
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:12.841]  What's better?
[01:29:12.841 --> 01:29:13.581]  Down-and-out?
[01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:14.121]  What's better?
[01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:16.382]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:29:16.382 --> 01:29:21.324]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:29:22.006 --> 01:29:25.970]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:27.311]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:29:27.311 --> 01:29:28.612]  They're all very diverse.
[01:29:28.612 --> 01:29:38.801]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[01:30:05.501 --> 01:30:08.282]  Supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy.
[01:30:08.282 --> 01:30:14.605]  We could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[01:30:14.605 --> 01:30:16.146]  But now we've got it.
[01:30:16.146 --> 01:30:18.267]  30 parts per million from the top lab.

[01:30:59.218 --> 01:31:07.362]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:31:07.362 --> 01:31:17.806]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:31:19.167 --> 01:31:24.017]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[01:31:24.017 --> 01:31:29.689]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:31:31.556 --> 01:31:40.438]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems, our brain and our heart.

[01:31:58.274 --> 01:32:04.018]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:08.862]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:32:08.862 --> 01:32:11.884]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:32:11.884 --> 01:32:21.472]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:32:21.472 --> 01:32:24.054]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[01:32:24.694 --> 01:32:33.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.

[01:33:00.162 --> 01:33:06.048]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.081 --> 01:33:18.585]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[01:33:18.585 --> 01:33:29.691]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're gonna crash it into the World Trade Center.
[01:33:29.691 --> 01:33:35.274]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happened.
[01:33:36.414 --> 01:33:40.838]  Infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:33:40.838 --> 01:33:43.621]  Joe Biden literally saying y'all need to come.
[01:33:43.621 --> 01:33:50.047]  They need to come up with a new vaccine and they need to come up with a way that people have to take it no matter what.
[01:33:50.047 --> 01:33:52.930]  I'm willing to die about my freedom.
[01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:55.713]  I'm willing to die about my medical independence.
[01:33:55.713 --> 01:34:00.738]  So all I got to say to you in that video, try this around and find out.
[01:34:06.028 --> 01:34:12.814]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:19.819]  Well, the future president of the United States, and I don't just say that to kiss up to her, I feel it.
[01:34:19.819 --> 01:34:27.445]  I think the first female president of the United States, I think in maybe four or eight years, is going to be MTG.
[01:34:27.445 --> 01:34:31.729]  And I can't wait to support her for president of the United States if we save this country.
[01:34:32.429 --> 01:34:34.870]  But MTG, you wanted to get to what's coming next today.
[01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:36.431]  You said you can't wait to hear what's coming next.
[01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:38.191]  This is what InfoWars is all about.
[01:34:38.191 --> 01:34:41.393]  All the main numbers show economy and free fall in reality.
[01:34:41.393 --> 01:34:43.294]  We're going to hit that in a moment.
[01:34:43.294 --> 01:34:43.814]  But first...
[01:34:44.793 --> 01:34:47.996]  This isn't entertainment seeing Trump being attacked like this.
[01:34:47.996 --> 01:34:53.421]  This isn't like a boxing match, or a train wreck, or a soap opera.
[01:34:53.421 --> 01:35:03.731]  This is our future here, and yeah he's confident, and yeah it's waking people up, but we can't underestimate our enemies and what they may pull, because as Donna Brazile said, they're cornered rats and they're losing.
[01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:04.652]  I don't
[01:35:25.228 --> 01:35:25.788]  Blame us.
[01:35:25.788 --> 01:35:29.690]  They say it's this epidemic that doesn't exist per capita.
[01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:34.393]  And I'm really concerned about them going after Trump because logically, historically, that's the next move of the graph.
[01:35:35.695 --> 01:35:36.355]  Maybe.
[01:35:36.355 --> 01:35:41.037]  What I worry about, actually, is I worry about a hot war.
[01:35:41.037 --> 01:35:44.819]  I worry about a very serious war.
[01:35:44.819 --> 01:35:55.363]  Because, historically, if you look at our country, historically, whenever America has gone to war, the American people rally around whoever the president is.
[01:35:55.363 --> 01:35:56.903]  We remember George Bush after 9-11.
[01:35:56.903 --> 01:35:58.444]  October Surprise.
[01:35:58.444 --> 01:35:58.684]  Yes.
[01:35:59.423 --> 01:36:09.311]  So we remember, that's our natural instinct to rally behind our country, behind our flag.
[01:36:09.311 --> 01:36:13.674]  So many people will sign up to join the military and they rally behind the President.
[01:36:13.674 --> 01:36:20.920]  The biggest thing I'm concerned about Alex is I'm concerned that they will go to the next level with Ukraine, put troops on the ground.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:25.062]  Russia will absolutely see it for what it really is.
[01:36:25.062 --> 01:36:31.585]  They will go to war with us, and the United States and Russia will be in a hot war.
[01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:42.431]  That is my biggest concern, and I think that would be something that the Democrats, the State Department, the Biden Administration could move towards, because they will not back off of Ukraine.
[01:36:42.431 --> 01:36:45.933]  And that's exactly what Tucker's been saying, and now they're sending F-16s.
[01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:46.493]  We know U.S.
[01:36:46.493 --> 01:36:49.354]  troops are there as advisors, and we know Ukraine's losing now.
[01:36:49.354 --> 01:36:50.415]  So what are you hearing in Congress?
[01:36:50.615 --> 01:36:51.917]  My amendment failed on that.
[01:36:51.917 --> 01:36:54.740]  I had an amendment to block the F-16s going to Ukraine.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.282]  It failed on the House floor.
[01:36:56.282 --> 01:36:59.466]  We didn't have enough members of Congress to vote for it.
[01:36:59.466 --> 01:37:01.929]  That's the danger we're in, Alex.
[01:37:01.929 --> 01:37:03.171]  Clear escalation.
[01:37:03.171 --> 01:37:04.633]  There's not much levels left.
[01:37:04.633 --> 01:37:05.434]  No, there's very...
[01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:09.957]  From day one, I voted no for Ukraine.
[01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:11.798]  I voted no for money going there.
[01:37:11.798 --> 01:37:14.240]  I voted no to sanctions on Russia.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:24.046]  I voted no to all of it because the only solution there that makes any rational sense is for those two countries to come to peace terms and that's between them.
[01:37:24.046 --> 01:37:25.688]  That doesn't have to involve the United States.
[01:37:25.688 --> 01:37:27.129]  And Trump says he can end it overnight.
[01:37:27.129 --> 01:37:27.709]  That's true.
[01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:29.030]  The media says he can't.
[01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.490]  The U.S.
[01:37:29.490 --> 01:37:29.910]  runs it.
[01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:30.571]  Of course he can end it.
[01:37:30.771 --> 01:37:32.052]  Yeah, it can end overnight.
[01:37:32.052 --> 01:37:32.692]  You want to know how?
[01:37:32.692 --> 01:37:33.832]  We cut off the money.
[01:37:33.832 --> 01:37:34.893]  Zelensky even said it.
[01:37:34.893 --> 01:37:38.855]  He won't even have elections unless America funds his elections.
[01:37:38.855 --> 01:37:41.116]  I'll tell you how bad it is over there.
[01:37:41.116 --> 01:37:55.022]  The United States of America, we send Ukraine one billion, I'm sorry, you watching, people at home, send one billion dollars every single month, every single month to Ukraine to fund their government.
[01:37:55.262 --> 01:37:56.784]  That's not the war.
[01:37:56.784 --> 01:37:59.127]  That's to keep the lights on for their government.
[01:37:59.127 --> 01:38:02.351]  But $700 to people in Maui.
[01:38:02.351 --> 01:38:04.954]  $700 one time for the people in Maui.
[01:38:04.954 --> 01:38:06.075]  And that's outrageous.
[01:38:06.075 --> 01:38:07.377]  That's unacceptable.
[01:38:07.377 --> 01:38:13.124]  But I do believe what we could see is we could see them move us into a full-scale war.
[01:38:13.904 --> 01:38:19.931]  In Ukraine, all in the name of protecting Europe, they're always saying that Putin, his goal is to take Europe.
[01:38:19.931 --> 01:38:24.176]  We have seen no evidence of that whatsoever, and I'm not defending Vladimir Putin.
[01:38:24.176 --> 01:38:31.104]  I'm just saying, if you look at it black and white, and also- I mean, if Putin had hundreds of thousands of troops in Canada, I'd say go to war with him.
[01:38:31.104 --> 01:38:32.166]  We're there starting this.
[01:38:32.566 --> 01:38:33.347]  Right.
[01:38:33.347 --> 01:38:34.407]  But think about this.
[01:38:34.407 --> 01:38:35.828]  I mean, I'm old enough to remember.
[01:38:35.828 --> 01:38:36.869]  You remember?
[01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:40.832]  Every time we've ever been at war, didn't we watch it every single night on television?
[01:38:40.832 --> 01:38:47.416]  Remember how we would watch on television the bombing of Baghdad or the bombings in Afghanistan?
[01:38:47.416 --> 01:38:50.138]  It was like sick, disgusting entertainment.
[01:38:50.138 --> 01:38:52.820]  But they showed it nonstop on the news.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:39:00.084]  Let me ask you, when is the last time anyone has been able to turn on the television and watch the war that America is funding?
[01:39:02.806 --> 01:39:04.708]  No, you never see it.
[01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:07.831]  They say it's bigger than Vietnam, Korea.
[01:39:07.831 --> 01:39:09.733]  I mean, it's hundreds of 300,000 to 400,000 dead.
[01:39:09.733 --> 01:39:11.014]  This is a full war.
[01:39:11.014 --> 01:39:16.339]  Tell me where the CNN war reporters are and why aren't they in a bunker with Ukrainian troops?
[01:39:16.339 --> 01:39:17.139]  That's what they used to do.
[01:39:17.139 --> 01:39:18.040]  That's what we always saw.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:18.981]  Now it's like it's a war on another planet.
[01:39:25.216 --> 01:39:26.498]  It's an invisible war.
[01:39:26.498 --> 01:39:27.399]  You don't get to see it.
[01:39:27.399 --> 01:39:28.621]  You're paying for it.
[01:39:28.621 --> 01:39:29.983]  But you don't get to see it.
[01:39:29.983 --> 01:39:31.305]  You want to know why they're lying?
[01:39:31.305 --> 01:39:32.868]  Ukraine is losing this war.
[01:39:34.299 --> 01:39:36.861]  I'm probably the only member of Congress that will say that out loud.
[01:39:36.861 --> 01:39:37.262]  No, you are.
[01:39:37.262 --> 01:39:39.904]  And I love the meme, how you're not smart.
[01:39:39.904 --> 01:39:42.806]  You're, well, the smart people I know, you're so smart.
[01:39:42.806 --> 01:39:46.429]  I love the left claims they're old and power women, but they go, oh, MTG's dumb.
[01:39:46.429 --> 01:39:52.214]  No, you're saying the truth that is complex and sophisticated, and it's just, it's disgusting.
[01:39:52.214 --> 01:39:54.295]  And since when do Democrats support World War III?
[01:39:54.295 --> 01:39:54.856]  I guess they do now.
[01:39:55.583 --> 01:39:57.664]  Absolutely they do right now.
[01:39:57.664 --> 01:39:59.424]  They have to.
[01:39:59.424 --> 01:40:04.666]  They have to support World War III because it supports their climate change agenda.
[01:40:04.666 --> 01:40:06.826]  It changes the world.
[01:40:06.826 --> 01:40:13.008]  If you support a massive global war, it completely shifts everything.
[01:40:13.008 --> 01:40:14.609]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[01:40:14.609 --> 01:40:21.831]  They're trying to make a full shift in the way, basically the way we live, the way governments work, trade policies.
[01:40:21.831 --> 01:40:22.191]  But they're
[01:40:23.231 --> 01:40:28.315]  They're creeping onto the most dangerous levels that will hurt all of us, and here's why.
[01:40:28.315 --> 01:40:33.218]  Because we sanctioned Russia, Russia got smart and they went and made trade deals with China.
[01:40:33.218 --> 01:40:35.900]  And then they started making trade deals with other countries.
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:36.861]  That was my next point.
[01:40:36.861 --> 01:40:39.483]  This is destroying America's soft power.
[01:40:39.483 --> 01:40:44.447]  And I love our country, I love our empire, but I hate seeing America go way down in the world.
[01:40:44.727 --> 01:40:45.908]  Well, look at BRICS.
[01:40:45.908 --> 01:40:50.570]  Because of the war in Ukraine, they have created BRICS.
[01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:54.193]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[01:40:54.193 --> 01:41:00.896]  They've created this very powerful, growing international group where they can do trade, buy and sell goods.
[01:41:00.896 --> 01:41:02.797]  The Indians just bought billions in oil.
[01:41:02.797 --> 01:41:07.300]  Yeah, and they're going to tank our dollar because they trade in their own currencies, not the U.S.
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:07.660]  dollar.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:10.102]  They can trade in their own currencies.
[01:41:10.102 --> 01:41:11.382]  So what's the bigger 30,000 foot view?
[01:41:13.408 --> 01:41:22.754]  The 30,000-foot view is war is an option for the Democrats in their minds to win the election because they think it will rally the people.
[01:41:22.754 --> 01:41:26.957]  So you're saying what's coming next, and I agree with you, Tucker, is war.
[01:41:26.957 --> 01:41:27.858]  Expanded war.
[01:41:27.858 --> 01:41:28.438]  Absolutely.
[01:41:28.438 --> 01:41:29.239]  I see war.
[01:41:29.239 --> 01:41:43.168]  I see war because I introduce amendment after amendment on the House floor and I cannot get my amendments passed to stop F-16s, to stop funding to go to Ukraine, even though the American people overwhelmingly do not support the Ukraine war.
[01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:46.137]  And by the way, the Russians can shoot down a 5,000...
[01:41:49.221 --> 01:42:05.924]  Well, I think if you're to control the American people, number one, you have to make them feel afraid of something or multiple things.
[01:42:05.924 --> 01:42:07.825]  It doesn't have to be just one thing.
[01:42:07.825 --> 01:42:10.125]  It can be the continuing threat of COVID.
[01:42:10.125 --> 01:42:10.965]  It's continuing.
[01:42:10.965 --> 01:42:12.286]  It'll never go away.
[01:42:12.286 --> 01:42:16.467]  That's why they want new vaccines and more mask mandates and more vaccines.
[01:42:16.467 --> 01:42:17.507]  And we have to keep fighting.
[01:42:18.647 --> 01:42:21.668]  Like, yeah, we want new mandates, but you're crazy, we don't want new mandates.
[01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:22.008]  Right.
[01:42:22.008 --> 01:42:23.289]  You seen that little mind control?
[01:42:23.289 --> 01:42:24.329]  Oh, of course.
[01:42:24.329 --> 01:42:26.850]  And then, and now it's climate change.
[01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:39.814]  And oh, the poor people in Burning Man, and they're going to run out of there convinced, brainwashed, that that's what happened to them was because man-made climate change nearly killed them in the desert of Nevada.
[01:42:39.814 --> 01:42:43.015]  They're going to run out there and spread that.
[01:42:43.015 --> 01:42:47.277]  It'll be multiple issues, but the ultimate one is a world war.
[01:42:47.837 --> 01:42:50.718]  And I believe that's where we're going.
[01:42:50.718 --> 01:42:51.518]  Wow.
[01:42:51.518 --> 01:42:53.599]  Let's talk about impeachment again.
[01:42:53.599 --> 01:42:55.219]  You've got a website.
[01:42:55.219 --> 01:42:56.060]  What do people do there?
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:56.880]  How do they get involved?
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.921]  Because we need to put Biden on trial now.
[01:42:59.921 --> 01:43:01.381]  We've got the evidence.
[01:43:01.381 --> 01:43:04.342]  You promised months ago on the show, you said it's going to happen.
[01:43:04.342 --> 01:43:05.382]  Everything you said is coming true.
[01:43:05.382 --> 01:43:06.043]  What do we do?
[01:43:06.043 --> 01:43:06.563]  Thank you.
[01:43:06.563 --> 01:43:08.303]  Go to impeachmentteam.com.
[01:43:08.303 --> 01:43:09.904]  And I want to share some numbers with you, Alex.
[01:43:10.504 --> 01:43:11.725]  Oh yeah, job numbers too.
[01:43:11.725 --> 01:43:14.206]  Well, I have different numbers, and then we'll go to jobs.
[01:43:14.206 --> 01:43:16.947]  I'd like to talk about, here's how many people support it.
[01:43:16.947 --> 01:43:27.431]  Back in May, I put up a survey through my congressional website, through my congressional social media, and asked how many people support impeachment.
[01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:34.275]  Now, when you get polling numbers, you look at a poll and it says Trump is beating DeSantis by a gazillion points.
[01:43:34.275 --> 01:43:36.437]  Trump is beating Biden.
[01:43:36.437 --> 01:43:38.558]  And it says all these polling numbers.
[01:43:38.558 --> 01:43:41.840]  That's usually a poll of around 1,000 people.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.461]  And that's how they get those numbers.
[01:43:43.461 --> 01:43:44.902]  All polling works like that.
[01:43:44.902 --> 01:43:46.103]  You just choose your group you want.
[01:43:46.243 --> 01:43:48.706]  Yes, you target a group and you poll.
[01:43:48.706 --> 01:43:53.172]  So my poll has a poll of 39,832 people have come out in support of impeachment of Joe Biden.
[01:43:53.172 --> 01:43:54.694]  That has been going on since May.
[01:44:02.895 --> 01:44:04.156]  There's only 10,000 people against it.
[01:44:04.156 --> 01:44:04.756]  So this is a poll.
[01:44:04.756 --> 01:44:05.216]  It's a survey.
[01:44:05.216 --> 01:44:06.077]  So that's like two-thirds won.
[01:44:06.077 --> 01:44:06.697]  79% support impeachment.
[01:44:18.223 --> 01:44:21.966]  Twenty percent, just over twenty percent are against.
[01:44:21.966 --> 01:44:23.306]  That's how big it is.
[01:44:23.306 --> 01:44:24.647]  That's how big impeachment is.
[01:44:24.647 --> 01:44:25.788]  It has to happen.
[01:44:25.788 --> 01:44:30.291]  Impeachmentteam.com, impeachmentteam.com, help us.
[01:44:30.291 --> 01:44:31.532]  And then expect this.
[01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:34.054]  Everybody just says, oh impeach, impeach.
[01:44:34.054 --> 01:44:34.934]  It takes work.
[01:44:34.934 --> 01:44:36.275]  No, it takes work.
[01:44:36.275 --> 01:44:39.757]  And the reason why it takes work is we want to do it the right way.
[01:44:39.757 --> 01:44:42.019]  How they impeached Trump was absolutely wrong.
[01:44:42.219 --> 01:44:44.340]  So you're teeing him up, you're taking your time.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.421]  Yes, because we have more power.
[01:44:46.421 --> 01:44:51.343]  Nancy Pelosi said, she just said, we're going to start an impeachment inquiry.
[01:44:51.343 --> 01:44:56.085]  We didn't vote, she just started one, and then they voted to impeach him.
[01:44:56.085 --> 01:44:58.306]  But this time we're doing it the correct way.
[01:44:58.306 --> 01:44:59.447]  We're actually going to vote.
[01:44:59.447 --> 01:45:02.688]  And they have enough evidence in the House to get the conviction of the Senate.
[01:45:02.688 --> 01:45:09.251]  For those that don't know, the House indicts, the Senate convicts, so Trump was never officially removed, they just started the impeachment.
[01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:14.215]  Well, the House impeaches, the Senate holds a trial and convicts.
[01:45:14.215 --> 01:45:23.903]  President Trump was impeached twice in the House, wrongfully impeached twice in the House, and I've introduced resolutions to expunge his impeachments.
[01:45:23.903 --> 01:45:24.764]  That's another matter.
[01:45:24.764 --> 01:45:27.146]  And now the Georgia peach is going to impeach Biden.
[01:45:29.803 --> 01:45:30.524]  That's the goal.
[01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:32.165]  That's what we're going to do.
[01:45:32.165 --> 01:45:36.888]  So we'll impeach him in the House and then there'd be a conviction and trial in the Senate.
[01:45:36.888 --> 01:45:38.049]  Now we know the reality there.
[01:45:38.049 --> 01:45:39.590]  I'm not going to lie to anyone.
[01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:41.591]  The Democrats control the Senate.
[01:45:41.591 --> 01:45:44.193]  But does that mean that we shouldn't do it anyways?
[01:45:44.193 --> 01:45:46.615]  No, it's a public destruction of him.
[01:45:46.615 --> 01:45:46.855]  Right.
[01:45:46.855 --> 01:45:48.957]  We've got to get on the offense.
[01:45:48.957 --> 01:45:50.077]  Where does Trump stand on impeachment?
[01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:50.818]  I know he's been pushing it.
[01:45:51.138 --> 01:45:52.679]  Oh, of course.
[01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:55.221]  Trump stands for holding people accountable.
[01:45:55.221 --> 01:45:59.504]  They're going, so it's, this, ours is not political.
[01:45:59.504 --> 01:46:14.554]  Ours is because we have absolute evidence, 100% evidence, that we are continually producing every single day on our committee investigations that Joe Biden was 100% involved in Hunter Biden's business deals.
[01:46:14.554 --> 01:46:17.576]  Not only just involved, he was very much an active partner.
[01:46:17.576 --> 01:46:18.637]  And Biden lied about all that.
[01:46:19.197 --> 01:46:20.258]  Joe Biden has lied.
[01:46:20.258 --> 01:46:21.499]  We've already proven he's lied.
[01:46:21.499 --> 01:46:27.003]  He said, I had nothing to do with Hunter Biden, had nothing to do with his business deals, nothing to do with my son's business.
[01:46:27.003 --> 01:46:31.345]  But we have it proven that a thousand percent he knew all of it.
[01:46:31.345 --> 01:46:33.367]  He was meeting his business partners.
[01:46:33.367 --> 01:46:39.911]  Hunter flew with Joe Biden, his father, while he was vice president to go have these business meetings.
[01:46:39.911 --> 01:46:44.835]  And Joe Biden was on the phone with business partners, was at the meetings in person himself.
[01:46:45.751 --> 01:46:47.052]  Joe Biden is the big guy.
[01:46:47.052 --> 01:46:48.632]  So what do you think they do to Joe Biden?
[01:46:48.632 --> 01:46:49.733]  Because they want to get rid of him.
[01:46:49.733 --> 01:46:51.714]  He can barely talk now.
[01:46:51.714 --> 01:47:01.278]  He's just grabbing women in public and he's completely out of his mind with serious dementia.
[01:47:01.278 --> 01:47:05.900]  I know there's no golden way to know what's happening, but gut level, you're a smart lady.
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:06.600]  What do they do about him?
[01:47:07.276 --> 01:47:10.119]  Alex, you're going to get this very easily from me.
[01:47:10.119 --> 01:47:12.722]  It's going to click for you real fast.
[01:47:12.722 --> 01:47:17.587]  Joe Biden is the best intelligence asset they have.
[01:47:17.587 --> 01:47:19.069]  You can't get a better one.
[01:47:19.069 --> 01:47:23.554]  You can't get a better president for the intelligence community than Joe Biden.
[01:47:23.554 --> 01:47:24.274]  Do you want to know why?
[01:47:24.895 --> 01:47:25.755]  Think about it.
[01:47:25.755 --> 01:47:27.416]  He's completely controlled.
[01:47:27.416 --> 01:47:31.257]  This is a man that was a Catholic that used to be against abortion.
[01:47:31.257 --> 01:47:32.537]  Where is he at now?
[01:47:32.537 --> 01:47:36.819]  He is for cutting the body parts off of children to change their gender.
[01:47:36.819 --> 01:47:38.379]  Why is he this way?
[01:47:38.379 --> 01:47:39.860]  Because he is controlled.
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:41.200]  Why is he controlled?
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:43.061]  Because he's a criminal.
[01:47:43.061 --> 01:47:49.643]  And he's caught and they've told him, we'll protect you, we got you covered Joe, as long as you keep going down this trail.
[01:47:49.643 --> 01:47:51.343]  So he gets all the blame and they hide behind him.
[01:47:52.964 --> 01:47:54.645]  They don't want to get rid of Joe Biden.
[01:47:54.645 --> 01:47:56.046]  He's the best.
[01:47:56.046 --> 01:47:56.906]  Think about it like this.
[01:47:56.906 --> 01:48:02.489]  Now for the mass, the public that doesn't really pay attention to politics, they don't know about the Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:48:02.489 --> 01:48:06.552]  They barely, they might know about it a little bit, but they don't really know.
[01:48:06.552 --> 01:48:07.492]  They see Joe Biden.
[01:48:07.492 --> 01:48:14.816]  He's innocent, sweet grandpa that stumbles his words every now and then, likes to get ice cream and just wants to help America.
[01:48:14.816 --> 01:48:16.377]  And he wants to help Ukraine.
[01:48:16.377 --> 01:48:18.619]  That's how they see Joe Biden.
[01:48:18.619 --> 01:48:22.421]  So they want to continue to keep that image of Joe.
[01:48:23.578 --> 01:48:43.261]  For the masses of people that are busy in their lives every single day, busy going to work, working two to three jobs, taking care of their children, maybe paying attention to sports, enjoying, just enjoying life, the great life we have as Americans, they are not in tune to everything about Joe Biden.
[01:48:43.261 --> 01:48:52.043]  And for that issue alone, the best president that can exist in the White House, especially for the intelligence community,
[01:48:52.743 --> 01:48:54.504]  Is Joe Biden.
[01:48:54.504 --> 01:48:56.104]  They keep him looking innocent.
[01:48:56.104 --> 01:48:57.384]  They protect him.
[01:48:57.384 --> 01:49:00.045]  They allow him to stay in the White House.
[01:49:00.045 --> 01:49:06.447]  They allow him to enjoy all the glory and they cover up his crimes as long as he's controlled.
[01:49:06.447 --> 01:49:08.108]  He continues their foreign wars.
[01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:12.469]  He continues to advance their Marxist agenda for America.
[01:49:12.469 --> 01:49:16.170]  He's the perfect president for the left and the intelligence community.
[01:49:17.509 --> 01:49:18.330]  He really is.
[01:49:18.330 --> 01:49:27.701]  So, as Donna Brazile and others admit that this is exploding Trump, as if they wouldn't know that would happen, what do they do as they get increasingly cornered?
[01:49:28.151 --> 01:49:29.391]  Here's what they've done.
[01:49:29.391 --> 01:49:32.292]  They've indicted President Trump too many times.
[01:49:32.292 --> 01:49:33.392]  Think about it.
[01:49:33.392 --> 01:49:39.114]  The more they indict him, the more they prove that all of this is political, and all of this is a lie.
[01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:42.394]  And people pay attention more, and more, and more.
[01:49:42.394 --> 01:49:48.776]  And the more people pay attention, they see it for exactly what it is, and it exposes everything they're doing.
[01:49:49.296 --> 01:49:50.597]  And you talked about this earlier.
[01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:09.751]  We saw double black folks voting for Trump.
[01:50:09.751 --> 01:50:14.114]  Usually 10% but Republican like 20-30% depending on the demographic.
[01:50:14.114 --> 01:50:15.455]  Males, females.
[01:50:15.455 --> 01:50:17.716]  Now it's just everywhere.
[01:50:17.716 --> 01:50:21.058]  All the big rappers, all the big people going against the system.
[01:50:21.058 --> 01:50:21.918]  They get it.
[01:50:21.918 --> 01:50:24.359]  It's viral everywhere.
[01:50:24.359 --> 01:50:25.280]  You live in Georgia.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.581]  I mean it looks like they're losing the black vote.
[01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:28.302]  I think Trump gets 50% now.
[01:50:29.122 --> 01:50:33.748]  I think he will, but we have to pay attention to absentee ballot voter fraud.
[01:50:33.748 --> 01:50:35.570]  Look at the case in Mississippi.
[01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:37.112]  There's a Democrat in Mississippi.
[01:50:37.112 --> 01:50:38.514]  Oh, I meant to play that video.
[01:50:38.514 --> 01:50:39.175]  Explain that to people.
[01:50:39.175 --> 01:50:40.937]  Yeah, so there's a Democrat in Mississippi.
[01:50:40.937 --> 01:50:42.158]  He has the text messages.
[01:50:42.158 --> 01:50:43.740]  He has the proof.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:44.962]  The absolute proof.
[01:50:45.242 --> 01:50:49.224]  That his election was stolen with absentee ballot fraud.
[01:50:49.224 --> 01:50:52.645]  They were coming in with thumb drives for the election machines.
[01:50:52.645 --> 01:50:55.086]  They stole the election from him.
[01:50:55.086 --> 01:50:56.947]  And he has the proof of it.
[01:50:56.947 --> 01:50:58.988]  And he is yelling and screaming about it.
[01:50:58.988 --> 01:51:01.809]  And we've known this is how they've always done it.
[01:51:01.809 --> 01:51:04.110]  It has always been an issue.
[01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:05.890]  Elections get stolen.
[01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:09.412]  And Democrats even steal them from other Democrats.
[01:51:09.412 --> 01:51:12.233]  It's not just Republicans they steal elections from.
[01:51:12.233 --> 01:51:14.394]  It's absolutely against other Democrats.
[01:51:14.774 --> 01:51:16.896]  Look at what happened to Bernie Sanders.
[01:51:16.896 --> 01:51:20.119]  Hillary Clinton stole that election from Bernie Sanders.
[01:51:20.119 --> 01:51:25.824]  So for President Trump to say my election was stolen, regular people are like, hell yeah it was!
[01:51:25.824 --> 01:51:28.847]  Because everybody knows that we voted and elected him.
[01:51:28.847 --> 01:51:29.107]  Exactly.
[01:51:29.107 --> 01:51:31.569]  I'm not like a leftist that will overstate our position.
[01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:34.371]  I'm seeing explosive awakening.
[01:51:34.371 --> 01:51:42.734]  Like, you think of any prominent talk show host now, or figure, whether it's James Woods or Joe Rogan or Russell Brand or Tulsi Gabbards or R.F.K.
[01:51:42.734 --> 01:51:43.474]  Jr.
[01:51:43.474 --> 01:51:46.175]  or people like Jimmy Dore.
[01:51:46.175 --> 01:51:51.277]  They're all, Trump's great, the New World Order's bad, the globalists are evil, we're in a coup, screw the Democrats.
[01:51:51.277 --> 01:51:54.318]  I mean, they've got hardcore liberals joining Trump.
[01:51:54.318 --> 01:51:55.879]  This is huge.
[01:51:55.879 --> 01:51:56.499]  It is huge.
[01:51:57.139 --> 01:52:02.142]  But there's a lot of things that are happening that, you know, we don't talk about a lot on the news.
[01:52:02.142 --> 01:52:03.562]  You've got five minutes left.
[01:52:03.562 --> 01:52:04.123]  You're awesome.
[01:52:04.123 --> 01:52:05.103]  You've got the floor.
[01:52:05.103 --> 01:52:06.244]  Address that camera right there.
[01:52:06.244 --> 01:52:06.904]  You tell them.
[01:52:06.904 --> 01:52:07.624]  Okay, I'd love to.
[01:52:07.624 --> 01:52:08.485]  You're hosting right now.
[01:52:08.485 --> 01:52:09.525]  Okay, great.
[01:52:09.525 --> 01:52:10.566]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:52:10.566 --> 01:52:11.586]  Oh, thank you for being here.
[01:52:11.586 --> 01:52:12.827]  Oh, my God.
[01:52:12.827 --> 01:52:15.789]  So, here's something that I think is a major issue.
[01:52:15.789 --> 01:52:19.090]  So, the Friday jobs report comes out.
[01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:20.271]  1.2 million Americans.
[01:52:20.271 --> 01:52:21.411]  And we have those graphics, guys.
[01:52:21.411 --> 01:52:21.892]  Put them on screen.
[01:52:21.892 --> 01:52:22.192]  Start over.
[01:52:23.353 --> 01:52:25.857]  1.2 million Americans lost their jobs.
[01:52:25.857 --> 01:52:28.241]  That was on Friday's jobs report.
[01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:36.413]  But at the same time, over 600,000 foreigners, people from other countries, gained American jobs.
[01:52:36.413 --> 01:52:37.835]  So put that into perspective.
[01:52:39.317 --> 01:52:46.181]  1.2 million Americans lost their jobs, but we imported foreign workers and gave them American jobs.
[01:52:46.181 --> 01:52:52.786]  And I want to talk about that, Alex, because this is what I see at home in my district, but it's happening all over the country.
[01:52:52.786 --> 01:52:53.367]  And talk about it.
[01:52:53.367 --> 01:52:55.728]  I'm going to go to the control room and I'm going to put these graphs on the screen.
[01:52:55.728 --> 01:52:56.089]  Keep going.
[01:52:56.889 --> 01:52:58.770]  So, tax credits.
[01:52:58.770 --> 01:53:03.851]  We see state governments, we see county governments, but we see the federal government as well.
[01:53:03.851 --> 01:53:09.693]  And the Biden administration has done this extensively, especially because of the Green New Deal.
[01:53:09.693 --> 01:53:20.736]  They've given tax credits and given a lot of your hard-earned tax dollars to these foreign countries' businesses to bring them in to give Americans jobs.
[01:53:20.736 --> 01:53:22.777]  Let me explain the danger of that for you.
[01:53:23.297 --> 01:53:41.606]  So for example, you'll see maybe a battery company, because of course they love green energy, and they'll pay the battery company, they'll pay them by giving them free land, they'll give them tax credits to move in and build their site, build their manufacturing plant.
[01:53:41.966 --> 01:53:45.887]  They'll bring them in and they'll help them get completely set up.
[01:53:45.887 --> 01:53:47.768]  They'll even spend money.
[01:53:47.768 --> 01:53:56.511]  Like in Georgia, they have a job training program that they will train workers for these companies that they bring into Georgia.
[01:53:56.511 --> 01:54:00.832]  So that's paid for by Georgia taxpayers, which is so insulting.
[01:54:00.832 --> 01:54:02.173]  And here's why it's insulting.
[01:54:02.813 --> 01:54:21.161]  When a foreign country's business gets to move into, say, my state or my district or your state or somewhere around where you live, and they get the help from the federal government and the state government to move there with tax dollars, they are directly competing with the existing businesses that are already there.
[01:54:21.161 --> 01:54:22.462]  And here's how they're competing.
[01:54:22.802 --> 01:54:24.863]  We have a worker shortage in America.
[01:54:24.863 --> 01:54:27.545]  We don't have enough workers on every level.
[01:54:27.545 --> 01:54:35.470]  That goes from doctors, pilots, nurses, construction workers, plumbers, linemen, you name it, truck drivers.
[01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:37.412]  We do not have enough workers in America.
[01:54:37.932 --> 01:54:52.809]  So our government pays these foreign countries to bring their businesses into our country and then these foreign country businesses get set up and they steal workers away from the existing American companies.
[01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:56.110]  That is the big problem that's happening right now.
[01:54:56.110 --> 01:55:02.452]  So we're seeing job reports where we're seeing 1.2 million Americans lose their jobs.
[01:55:02.452 --> 01:55:02.772]  Why?
[01:55:02.772 --> 01:55:04.312]  Because of Bidenomics.
[01:55:04.312 --> 01:55:06.652]  Bidenomics is destroying our economy.
[01:55:06.652 --> 01:55:08.653]  It's destroying small businesses.
[01:55:08.653 --> 01:55:12.273]  It's destroying many ways for people to keep up.
[01:55:12.273 --> 01:55:19.155]  And so you see these American companies failing and faltering and Americans are losing their jobs.
[01:55:19.155 --> 01:55:19.595]  But guess what?
[01:55:19.595 --> 01:55:21.595]  It's because of an unfair playing field.
[01:55:21.775 --> 01:55:22.676]  That's right.
[01:55:22.676 --> 01:55:24.217]  But think about how bad it is.
[01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:27.700]  So I have the flooring industry in Dalton, Georgia.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:28.700]  It is a massive industry.
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:31.282]  By the way, you're not talking out of your patootie here.
[01:55:31.282 --> 01:55:33.344]  You're a very successful business lady on the right.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:34.180]  That's right.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:36.502]  I've run a construction company for over 25 years.
[01:55:36.502 --> 01:55:38.563]  I've been in business for a long time.
[01:55:38.563 --> 01:55:39.424]  Here's what's happening.
[01:55:39.424 --> 01:55:42.226]  So we have these massive flooring companies.
[01:55:42.226 --> 01:55:46.369]  I'm talking about some of the biggest in the world are in Dalton, Georgia.
[01:55:46.369 --> 01:55:54.935]  Well, we have Joe Biden bragging because he funded a solar panel company to be able to expand and build another manufacturing plant.
[01:55:54.935 --> 01:55:58.137]  And they've also funded other companies to move into my district.
[01:55:58.137 --> 01:55:59.478]  Well, guess what's happening?
[01:55:59.478 --> 01:56:01.540]  This battery production plant,
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:06.021]  I even saw their brainwashing employees into communism at the meetings.
[01:56:06.021 --> 01:56:07.902]  Well, let me tell you what they do.
[01:56:07.902 --> 01:56:09.962]  There aren't enough workers.
[01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:11.763]  There aren't enough workers, Alex.
[01:56:11.763 --> 01:56:17.265]  So they are stealing workers from the flooring company's manufacturing plants.
[01:56:17.265 --> 01:56:20.045]  They're stealing workers from other companies.
[01:56:20.045 --> 01:56:22.906]  And no one can keep workers.
[01:56:22.906 --> 01:56:24.067]  Their people just aren't there.
[01:56:24.067 --> 01:56:24.767]  So you know what they're doing?
[01:56:25.367 --> 01:56:28.249]  They're importing them from overseas.
[01:56:28.249 --> 01:56:34.334]  So in my district, they're bringing in thousands of foreign workers because they don't have enough labor.
[01:56:34.334 --> 01:56:35.534]  Unfortunately, we're out of time.
[01:56:35.534 --> 01:56:38.256]  Anytime you want the show, you can host it or take over.
[01:56:38.256 --> 01:56:39.097]  You are awesome.
[01:56:39.097 --> 01:56:40.298]  In closing, what do we do about this?
[01:56:40.762 --> 01:56:45.244]  What we do about it is we have to fight like hell to fight for America First policies.
[01:56:45.244 --> 01:56:47.465]  We get President Trump back in the White House.
[01:56:47.465 --> 01:56:50.226]  You guys go to impeachmentteam.com.
[01:56:50.226 --> 01:56:56.188]  We're going to impeach Joe Biden and we're going to, we are going to painfully, painfully make him go through this.
[01:56:56.188 --> 01:57:01.910]  And that's why they're so scared because administratively, legally, we can end all this very quickly.
[01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:02.871]  Could we end it right now?
[01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:04.831]  No, we had Trump in.
[01:57:04.831 --> 01:57:07.012]  Oh, if we had Trump in, none of this would be happening.
[01:57:07.012 --> 01:57:07.932]  That's why we want him back.
