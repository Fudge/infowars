[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:07.876]  One of my journalist sources is proving to be extremely accurate, sort of calling me desperately yesterday morning before the attack in Dallas.
[00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:15.464]  And he said, I'm authorized to tell you off record and name names, the name of the intelligence officer who gave him this information.
[00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:18.767]  But he said, do not go to shopping malls or grocery stores.
[00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:23.996]   that the two largest drug cartels have not worked together in more than 20 years
[00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:28.557]   have made a deal and are working with the Biden administration to launch terror attacks
[00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:34.397]   inside the United States using operatives where they'll kidnap their mother or their son or their
[00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:39.037]   daughter and say if you don't run people over if you don't go shoot people we're going to kill your
[00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:49.677]   sister your daughter your mother your father. Ladies and gentlemen we're live.
[00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:51.853]  This is an incredibly important transmission.
[00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:53.154]  Sunday, May 7, 2023.
[00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:56.397]  Believe me, you need to talk about it, you know.
[00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:56.857]  Tune in now.
[00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.883]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:20.671]   All right, I told you two weeks ago on air, That I met with high-level federal officials concerning the total collapse of the border two weeks ago.
[00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:25.213]  And that we're going to be breaking major news here on air.
[00:01:27.074 --> 00:01:30.876]  Now, I'm going to do the best job I can here today to lay this out.
[00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:32.216]  We have a special guest joining us as well.
[00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:39.639]  You're looking at footage right now of the man who was arrested reportedly in Brownsville, Texas for running over dozens of people, killing at least seven of them.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.660]  And viewer discretion is advised.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.206]   I'm showing you this because You need to know how serious the situation is.
[00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:56.913]  This is people mowed over, illegal aliens at a migrant center by a Hispanic male, according to local reports.
[00:01:57.393 --> 00:01:58.934]  That's in the local news in Brownsville.
[00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:04.359]  The state police have said that they are not showing this on the national news.
[00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.361]  We're also going to show you footage right now of your TV viewer.
[00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:14.367]  The footage has all been posted in fullwords.com of the shooting yesterday in a suburb of North Dallas.
[00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:18.237]  We're including a five-year-old little girl with her head blown off.
[00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:22.699]  We do not enjoy showing this, but you need to know how real this terrorism is.
[00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.339]  So, here's what happened.
[00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:34.823]  One of my journalist sources, who's proven to be extremely accurate, started calling me desperately yesterday morning, before the attack in Dallas.
[00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:46.863]   And he said, I'm authorized to tell you off record and name names, the name of the intelligence officer who gave him this information, But he said, do not go to shopping malls or grocery stores.
[00:02:48.204 --> 00:03:09.057]  That the two largest drug cartels have not worked together in more than 20 years, have made a deal and are working with the Biden administration to launch terror attacks inside the United States using operatives where they'll kidnap their mother or their son or their daughter and say, if you don't run people over, if you don't go shoot people, we're going to kill your sister, your daughter, your mother, your father.
[00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:14.075]  Hours later, what the source told us was imminent happened.
[00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:17.739]  The source started calling our other source Friday night.
[00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.881]  He didn't talk to him until 10.30 in the morning.
[00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:20.902]  He checked his phone record.
[00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:22.364]  This happened, what, 1.32 p.m.
[00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:23.045]  in the afternoon.
[00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:28.240]  So that's powerful and it fits into the whole picture.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.742]  Biden said there's no crisis at the border for two and a half years.
[00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.125]  He said surge the border, out of control crime, out of control murder.
[00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:49.715]  Now as the border completely collapses and up to 80,000 people are set to come across on Thursday when Title 42 expires in El Paso alone, suddenly they say, oh my gosh, it's a giant crisis.
[00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:52.057]  And here's how it's going to work, according to the sources.
[00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:53.378]  And I agree with their analysis.
[00:03:56.072 --> 00:04:00.434]  They activate the cartels that do this stuff every few minutes in Mexico, every few hours.
[00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:02.795]  They rule by terror.
[00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:08.278]  They start shooting people, bombing people, running people over through their operatives.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.203]  And then Biden comes and says, oh my gosh, we've got to take the Second Amendment and I will secure the border and I'll bring in a new title.
[00:04:18.797 --> 00:04:24.601]  This is footage this morning in Brownsville of a food truck being ransacked and robbed as they try to hand out food.
[00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:26.883]  And I noticed people on Twitter said, oh, that's not El Paso.
[00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:28.544]  Look at the lower right hand corner.
[00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:29.745]  El Paso.
[00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:30.626]  Fighting hunger.
[00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:31.807]  No, that happened.
[00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:32.728]  I checked the local news.
[00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:35.990]  It is complete bedlam.
[00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:40.834]  Our crew will be down there Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:44.036]  I will be deploying down there very, very soon as well.
[00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:45.818]  But Owen Schroer and our people are going.
[00:04:46.758 --> 00:04:47.299]  Pray for us.
[00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:56.671]  But the entire stretch of the border, 300 plus miles of it, is a war zone right now.
[00:04:56.731 --> 00:05:01.435]  Even areas in the middle of the desert have people coming across it, promised they could come into the U.S.
[00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:02.115]  by Biden.
[00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:12.723]  The drug cartels on the surface are angry because if Title 42 gets lifted, they won't have people being deported all the time so they can make money five, six, seven, eight, nine times off of them, paying $10,000, $5,000, $20,000 to come across.
[00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:25.564]  But it's being allowed to happen by the Biden administration, wink-wink, the cartels the CIA works with, because this will be the terror they need as the pretext to take the American people's guns.
[00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:30.386]  And Biden put out a press release saying it's time to confiscate all semi-autos one hour ago.
[00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:33.547]  We can save the Republic together, but we've got to face the facts.
[00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:38.409]  America is now under leftist-coordinated terror attack, just like the attack in Tennessee was a leftist.
[00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.010]  They're still suppressing that information.
[00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.370]  Stay with us.
[00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.652]  Piles of dead bodies, including children in North Dallas.
[00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:53.620]  A car ramming through more than 25 people, killing at least seven in Brownsville, Texas on the border.
[00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:58.762]  We're showing TV viewers, radio listeners are spared this, the full video if you want to see it, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:05.683]  But we're showing this to our TV viewers and TV stations because you need to see what real terrorism looks like.
[00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:08.804]  Alright, the border has completely collapsed.
[00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:10.909]  Millions of people are on their way.
[00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.132]  Hundreds of thousands of different cities are stacked up, ready to come in when Title 42 goes through.
[00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:21.056]  Because these are people that don't have the money to pay the cartels the minimum 7,000 to come across.
[00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:21.996]  If you're from China, it's 50.
[00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:23.958]  Africa, 20.
[00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.300]  The cartels are making tens of billions of dollars a month off of this.
[00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:30.302]  We've watched the congressional hearings.
[00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:38.513]   And Biden, by saying, surge the border immediately if I get elected, Has made it many times worse than it was even under Obama.
[00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:40.354]  Trump basically shut it down 98%.
[00:06:40.554 --> 00:06:43.856]  The Border Patrol did an excellent job and they had good leadership.
[00:06:44.376 --> 00:06:47.958]  The Border Patrol, more than 10,000 feds have been whistleblowers.
[00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:54.420]  I myself have been in private secret meetings with high-level, I mean high-level federal officials.
[00:06:54.961 --> 00:07:06.563]   Not just FBI agents, not just federal marshals, not just Navy SEALs, but We're talking Zoom meetings with top people two weeks ago saying this is all coming.
[00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:12.846]  One of my other big sources started calling me at 1030 on Saturday.
[00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:31.136]  His sources started calling him, that's when he talked to his source, and said they're going to start launching terror attacks first in Texas and all over the country, targeting migrant centers, illegal aliens, because the cartels want them to know if you come across without paying us money, we're going to kill you.
[00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:35.234]  And I asked the sources, well, doesn't Biden know?
[00:07:35.294 --> 00:07:36.455]  They already work with the cartels.
[00:07:36.975 --> 00:07:39.275]  Nancy Pelosi said MS-13's God's children.
[00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:46.716]  They said, absolutely, they're going to use this hysteria and this new war with the cartels as the pretext to take the Second Amendment.
[00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:52.717]  About an hour ago, an hour and 10 minutes ago, Biden called for repealing the Second Amendment and taking all semi-autos.
[00:07:54.178 --> 00:07:56.338]  So this is what came in before the shooting yesterday.
[00:07:56.358 --> 00:08:00.319]  And then I talked to the sources joining us and about the source with the sources in about 20 minutes.
[00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:05.045]  I just heard something sick from my best source.
[00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.085]  Almost made me throw up.
[00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:15.508]  The insider said the cartel sit-down says, this happened two weeks ago, he thinks this operation may come from way on top.
[00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:19.209]  Two top rival cartels never sit down to coordinate.
[00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:24.750]  He thinks the entire scheme is to give Biden what he needs to justify not lifting Title 42 and make him look like a hero.
[00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.940]   But the criminal regime Obama holder Is behind it.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:29.640]  U.S.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.004]  political regime stands to lose billions as well as a majority of them are on the payroll.
[00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:34.965]  Confirmed.
[00:08:35.545 --> 00:08:37.367]  That came in at 10.30 or so today.
[00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:40.470]  Unprecedented meeting between Gulf and Sinaloa cartel.
[00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.312]  My source gave me permission to let you know who they are.
[00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:44.053]  I'm not going to say the name.
[00:08:44.554 --> 00:08:47.036]  Who was a multi-decade contractor for the intel services.
[00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:48.537]  Some of the best contacts in the world.
[00:08:48.597 --> 00:08:49.738]  And this is a great source gave me this.
[00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:51.600]  But I was already getting this information.
[00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.863]  It came in before this happened.
[00:08:57.605 --> 00:09:01.248]  The high-level source contacted Pete Santilli that's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.951]  Friday night, said, please call me.
[00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:07.894]  Santilli didn't call until 10 in the morning, called me right after.
[00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:11.177]  And I'm like, okay, they're going to attack, they're going to have terror.
[00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:13.199]  And then a couple hours later, it happens.
[00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:19.945]  And then a truck attack in Brownsville, running over 20, maybe 30 people, they're not sure, at least seven dead.
[00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:25.387]  We're going to show you the footage of people's legs, arms chopped off, blood spraying everywhere.
[00:09:25.727 --> 00:09:30.649]  We do not enjoy showing this, but you need to know how serious this situation is.
[00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:34.131]  Viewer discretion is advised, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:34.151 --> 00:09:35.071]  And people are mad about this.
[00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:39.293]  Walter Cronkite in the late 60s showed little girls with their skin burned off with napalm.
[00:09:39.973 --> 00:09:41.094]  People need to see the reality.
[00:09:41.134 --> 00:09:41.994]  It's not the gun.
[00:09:42.434 --> 00:09:43.495]  It's not the SUV.
[00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:45.075]  It's the evil people doing this.
[00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:56.120]   And you ask, how do they have, and show the footage of the Hispanic male, Looks like a military contractor being arrested and the police saying he's the one that did it.
[00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:58.143]  We'll show that footage in a moment.
[00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:10.471]   Well, guess who the reported killer in North Dallas is Mauricio Martinez Garcia,
[00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:16.831]   high level security contractor with multiple certificates for armed security,
[00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:23.111]   dresses up in a paramilitary all black outfit and goes to a mainly Hispanic mall
[00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:28.552]   and sprays a bunch of Hispanics congregating outside the doors of the mall.
[00:10:28.552 --> 00:10:32.350]   Anybody that goes to a major mall knows Hispanics are like old fashioned people
[00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.170]  like white people did 50 years ago.
[00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.751]   They hang around and talk outside of markets, outside of malls.
[00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:41.591]   So mainly that's what the footage shows, a bunch of Hispanics are hanging around
[00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:48.351]   outside a mall in North Dallas, putting little kids, this guy overhead shot please,
[00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:54.870]   Mauricio Martinez Garcia, no criminal record, high level security.
[00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:59.896]  Security officer training pulls up and kills them, shooting them in the heads.
[00:11:01.237 --> 00:11:04.299]  A police officer nearby had stopped him, or it could have been hundreds of dead.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.302]  The answer is the police officer with a gun.
[00:11:07.342 --> 00:11:09.184]  The answer is the concealed carry holder with a gun.
[00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.145]  The answer, I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:11:11.265 --> 00:11:12.166]  He used a gun.
[00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:14.048]  This other guy just used a truck.
[00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:19.853]  Why are Hispanics attacking Hispanics?
[00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:39.975]  The media is suppressing all this because, according to the intel, the cartels have probably kidnapped their mothers, their wives, their children, and Zoom them or FaceTime them and say, here's your five-year-old daughter, here's your wife, here's your mother, I'm gonna blow their head off, and by the way, let me just cut their finger off right in front of you right now.
[00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:49.683]   Or they'll have a couple of the daughters and the mom there, they'll go ahead and just slit the mom's throat and say, if you don't kill people right now, We're gonna kill your daughters.
[00:11:50.123 --> 00:11:51.844]  That's how they do it.
[00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:59.665]  Now, for the average person that doesn't study super-dirty black ops and dirty war, they'll just hear the media.
[00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:06.566]  There's suddenly bombs, I predict car bombs, and mass shootings and car attacks and truck attacks, and they'll think, what the hell's going on?
[00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:07.486]  We gotta give our guns up.
[00:12:08.907 --> 00:12:13.348]  The last thing we're gonna do is be like Mexico that has no Second Amendment, so they're a failed state.
[00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:15.188]  We're not giving in to this terror.
[00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:18.930]  And like Governor Greg Abbott said, the answer is more guns, not less.
[00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.390]  And a good man with a gun stopped this guy.
[00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.711]  But let me tell you, Devin Centilli called me up yesterday.
[00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:37.653]  I was trying to spend time with my youngest daughter, and my mother-in-law's in town, and we're out swimming at a local community pool.
[00:12:39.273 --> 00:12:41.454]  And the phone's over and over again.
[00:12:41.474 --> 00:12:42.214]  I'm like, what is going on?
[00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.311]  Until he's like, they're going to start attacking people as we mass murder.
[00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:47.832]  We got to tell everybody.
[00:12:50.114 --> 00:12:51.996]  He's been on the inside of this for a long time.
[00:12:52.816 --> 00:12:55.578]  And I was like, okay, well, all right, we'll talk to you next week.
[00:12:55.598 --> 00:12:56.079]  I'm going to the board.
[00:12:56.099 --> 00:12:56.359]  We'll do it.
[00:12:56.719 --> 00:12:58.080]  And then hours later, this happens.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.163]  And I'm thinking, wow, that's really chilling.
[00:13:01.183 --> 00:13:02.024]  Maybe that's what's happening.
[00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:03.605]  And then there's a car attack.
[00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:07.723]  I mean, folks, this goes on in Mexico all the time.
[00:13:07.763 --> 00:13:11.688]  The cartels will order, say, take Cancun is controlled by the government, the military.
[00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:13.550]  One of the few zones that's somewhat safe.
[00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.312]  And they don't pay enough protection money.
[00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:21.439]  You'll see dozens of robberies, murders a day, bombing, shootings to the cartels.
[00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:22.300]  That's what they do.
[00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:34.706]   And here in America, If you've got millions of people coming across the European on average, $10,000, $15,000, the lowest is $7,000 according to congressional testimony, and I agree with that analysis.
[00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:35.867]  It's been looked into.
[00:13:35.887 --> 00:13:36.687]  I've talked to my sources.
[00:13:37.728 --> 00:13:40.711]  What's millions times $7,000?
[00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:42.192]  Or $10,000?
[00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:43.193]  It's billions.
[00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:49.279]  And so all hell is breaking loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:56.337]   And again, the backdrop of that is an uneducated public, an uninformed, haplessly No major memory.
[00:13:56.397 --> 00:14:00.340]  Public will just think, well, my gosh, there's mass shootings and car attacks and all this.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.701]  We've got to take the guns.
[00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.102]  And that's the goal here.
[00:14:04.663 --> 00:14:05.644]  We're in a major war.
[00:14:05.704 --> 00:14:06.885]  The dollar's dying.
[00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:10.288]  There's absolute tyranny unfolding.
[00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:13.590]  The government's declared any opposition to what it's doing is terrorism.
[00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.973]  And meanwhile, Biden said immediately surge the border if I get elected.
[00:14:17.553 --> 00:14:20.636]  And then now two and a half years later, he's like, oh, the crisis got so bad.
[00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:21.937]  Oh, I'm going to fix it.
[00:14:22.317 --> 00:14:24.879]  And his press secretary says, you know, it's all Trump's fault.
[00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:28.284]  When Trump stopped this, the Border Patrol did a great job.
[00:14:29.065 --> 00:14:30.365]  Really hard job stopping this.
[00:14:30.445 --> 00:14:31.586]  I mean, they cut it back 98%.
[00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.147]  It was basically shut down.
[00:14:35.528 --> 00:14:36.909]  And now it's completely out of control.
[00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:39.490]  And again, the cartels are like, you're going to end Title 42?
[00:14:40.071 --> 00:14:41.932]  Where people actually don't get deported?
[00:14:41.952 --> 00:14:43.173]  Because you're just going to legalize everybody.
[00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:47.335]  And people heard that and came in and said, we're not paying the cartels.
[00:14:47.715 --> 00:14:48.756]  We can all just come across.
[00:14:48.776 --> 00:14:50.056]  The cartels are like, oh really?
[00:14:50.877 --> 00:14:51.717]  We're going to bomb you.
[00:14:51.917 --> 00:14:52.738]  We're going to shoot you.
[00:14:52.978 --> 00:14:54.259]  We're going to run over you with cars.
[00:14:55.546 --> 00:14:59.688]  The sickness of this is, the word is from the highest levels, it was green lit.
[00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:03.970]  Because Biden's going to bring back Title 42 but selectively enforce it later.
[00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.411]  But right now he's letting the chaos break out.
[00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:09.153]  So everybody, you know, tune in now, however you're listening.
[00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:10.674]  This could not be more critical.
[00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:13.415]  We can stop this together or it's the end of the republic.
[00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:20.341]  Emergency terrorism alert. Emergency terrorism alert.
[00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:22.980]  Emergency terrorism alert.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:28.021]   Texas mass shooting truck attack beginning a Mexican cartel terror campaign.
[00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:30.270]  We are live, Sunday night.
[00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:32.751]  All right.
[00:15:37.113 --> 00:15:37.834]  Here's what we know.
[00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:40.447]  Yesterday at about 2 p.m.
[00:15:40.467 --> 00:16:02.542]  in the afternoon, Maurice Martinez Garcia with no criminal record and level 3 security training certificate, which means armed security, in a black tactical gear outfit attacks a shopping mall, reportedly, and guns down Hispanics.
[00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.866]  Want to know where to go kill illegal immigrants?
[00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:12.513]  They're just like any other culture 50 years ago.
[00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:14.735]  They go hang out in front of markets.
[00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.577]  And I've looked at the people in the piles of dead bodies.
[00:16:19.118 --> 00:16:20.579]  The eight dead people and the wounded.
[00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:22.901]  Every one of them I saw was a Hispanic.
[00:16:26.063 --> 00:16:33.809]  Another Hispanic man today in Brownsville runs over 25 to 30 people killing at least seven.
[00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.210]  The reports are coming in that more may have died.
[00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:41.332]   I'll show you that graphic footage to show you how serious Situation is.
[00:16:42.853 --> 00:16:45.775]  That was a quote migrant processing center in Brownsville.
[00:16:45.795 --> 00:16:47.036]  There's a man with his leg cut off.
[00:16:48.957 --> 00:16:49.577]  Foot cut off.
[00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:53.360]  Why are Hispanic males?
[00:16:56.522 --> 00:16:57.603]  Targeting Hispanics.
[00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.985]  Well, I got the call from a high levels.
[00:17:02.506 --> 00:17:03.707]  Very connected individual.
[00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:07.330]  Who's been nothing but dead on?
[00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.311]  His reports.
[00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:18.069]  That his federal source, who he's confirmed to me the identity of, told him this was imminent on Friday.
[00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:21.110]  He talked to him Saturday morning, hours before this happened.
[00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.811]  This is what the cartels do in Central and South America and Southern North America.
[00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:28.351]  This is what they do.
[00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:28.771]  This is their MO.
[00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:34.473]  Do you think they're going to give up tens of billions of dollars a year with Title 42 not letting people get deported, bring them back in?
[00:17:35.313 --> 00:17:39.934]  Think they're going to just let all those people come up there and not pay them and put arm bracelets on to come in?
[00:17:39.954 --> 00:17:39.994]  No.
[00:17:42.602 --> 00:17:49.624]  They're going to kill them, and they've said they're going to kill the migrants, the illegal aliens, all over the United States.
[00:17:50.284 --> 00:17:59.967]  Then Biden swoops in, supposedly takes out the cartels, which he won't do, puts in a new Title 42, which he selectively enforces.
[00:18:01.169 --> 00:18:08.314]  The Democratic Party could take all the laundered money from the billions being paid to the cartels and continue this scam on.
[00:18:08.615 --> 00:18:13.858]  But they plan to use this to come after the Second Amendment and for further destabilization.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.542]  Here again is a screenshot of the video of Maurice Garcia.
[00:18:21.524 --> 00:18:22.965]  Maurice Martinez Garcia.
[00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:24.787]  We actually have the footage this is from.
[00:18:24.807 --> 00:18:25.367]  We'll show you.
[00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:30.371]  Where they're shooting through the coffee shop window after he's shot by the police.
[00:18:33.937 --> 00:18:37.919]  See the graphic aftermath of Texas shooting on Infowars.com.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.782]  Here are the images of the little five-year-old girl with her brains blown out.
[00:18:42.802 --> 00:18:46.003]  Sorry to show that, but the Second Amendment stopped more of that happening.
[00:18:47.164 --> 00:18:50.486]  These individuals, dead.
[00:18:52.767 --> 00:18:55.348]  Almost all reportedly Hispanic, like this person.
[00:18:57.829 --> 00:19:01.952]  Why are Hispanics, Latinos being targeted for death by Latinos?
[00:19:02.012 --> 00:19:02.592]  Who does that?
[00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:15.464]  Oh, he had gang tattoos on him of an affiliated major gang, the second largest Hispanic gang in Texas, that reportedly does murder for hire for the cartels.
[00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:22.428]  Think about that for a minute.
[00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:24.549]  Allen, Texas shooting.
[00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:31.254]  Tango Blast Gang, a prison gang affiliated with the very Mexican cartels.
[00:19:31.453 --> 00:19:33.453]  We were told we're going to do this.
[00:19:33.453 --> 00:19:41.453]  Texas mall shooting updates.
[00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:44.155]  Domestic terrorism probed as possible motive.
[00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:44.816]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:46.216]  ABC News.
[00:19:48.518 --> 00:19:53.520]  Texas Governor Abbott, usually behind the curve, calls for addressing mental health issues in wake of a Texas mass shooting.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:00.704]  Really, you got a security guard with the highest level security certification, level 3, killing people.
[00:20:00.724 --> 00:20:03.486]  That's like saying you can't trust the cops with guns.
[00:20:03.546 --> 00:20:03.646]  No.
[00:20:04.428 --> 00:20:08.729]  You have to look into who may have gone after his family and what really happened.
[00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:10.849]  That mall was a gun-free zone.
[00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:15.648]  There's their official page saying all of that.
[00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:25.648]  The tango blasting.
[00:20:25.648 --> 00:20:35.648]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:28.513 --> 00:20:30.053]  All right, so that's where we are right now.
[00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:39.466]  And the media, the controlled corporate media, is doing everything it can to not focus in on this.
[00:20:40.207 --> 00:20:41.728]  They're saying they don't know who did it.
[00:20:41.788 --> 00:20:43.150]  They don't know their race.
[00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.469]   Just like they won't release the manifesto of the trans man who was a woman
[00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:54.230]   killing all those people including children at that school in Tennessee.
[00:20:54.230 --> 00:21:03.509]   But what's not really getting reported is the car attack, the truck attack.
[00:21:03.744 --> 00:21:05.065]  And again, are we going to ban cars?
[00:21:06.526 --> 00:21:09.589]  Because someone used an SUV wrong.
[00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:10.530]  Remember Kenosha?
[00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.793]  When the racist black man ran over a bunch of people, killing a bunch of people, including children?
[00:21:15.113 --> 00:21:17.095]  They said, oh, it's an SUV attack.
[00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:21.759]  And they're saying it's a gun attack in North Texas, in Dallas.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.483]  But it's not the silver SUV to blame.
[00:21:27.841 --> 00:21:28.361]  We all know that.
[00:21:28.381 --> 00:21:29.182]  It's like the car.
[00:21:29.582 --> 00:21:31.443]  This isn't Stephen King's Christine.
[00:21:31.843 --> 00:21:33.464]  It's not a car going out and killing people.
[00:21:34.024 --> 00:21:41.228]  People laugh at that, but when it comes to guns, it's like, oh, if we just took the guns, it would happen.
[00:21:41.248 --> 00:21:51.654]  Yeah, there's the reported man that drove the truck, running over men, women, and children.
[00:21:53.737 --> 00:21:55.098]  And of course he's a white supremacist.
[00:21:55.878 --> 00:21:57.458]  But of course he's not a white supremacist.
[00:21:57.478 --> 00:21:58.779]  But what will the media plant?
[00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:00.319]  What will the media say?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.620]  What will they do?
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.862]  Do I need to explain to listeners that we're not in the new world order, we're deep inside it?
[00:22:07.569 --> 00:22:09.892]  And we need everybody to realize this is an information war.
[00:22:10.352 --> 00:22:11.534]  The truth of this needs to get out.
[00:22:11.554 --> 00:22:15.178]  A lot of brave people giving us information so we can get this information out to you.
[00:22:15.598 --> 00:22:18.361]  Please take the live show feed from Band.Video.
[00:22:18.762 --> 00:22:20.263]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:22:20.644 --> 00:22:21.885]  Madmaxworld.tv.
[00:22:22.406 --> 00:22:23.887]  Please take clips out of the show and share it.
[00:22:24.738 --> 00:22:27.803]  Please pray for an awakening to stop this.
[00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:31.990]  But they've allowed a lawless collapse border, bordering a failed state.
[00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.312]  What do you think's going to happen?
[00:22:33.633 --> 00:22:35.837]  And why suddenly is this happening?
[00:22:36.598 --> 00:22:38.701]  And what our sources say makes a lot of sense.
[00:22:40.196 --> 00:22:53.267]  You have cartels making tens of billions a year off this, and if Biden just outright legalizes them all, they won't be ever getting deported so they can't get multiple people paying them over and over again to come into the United States.
[00:22:53.867 --> 00:22:58.972]  We showed the footage earlier, go ahead and play it with audio, of the food trucks pulling up in El Paso this morning.
[00:22:59.172 --> 00:23:05.157]  It says El Paso on the side of the truck, and the media is saying it's fake because they can't admit this is going on.
[00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:06.198]  Look at the lower right-hand corner.
[00:23:06.598 --> 00:23:07.299]  El Paso.
[00:23:10.046 --> 00:23:13.089]  That is El Paso right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.151]  Tens of thousands already there.
[00:23:15.711 --> 00:23:18.133]  Sixty, seventy thousand ready to come in just in one city.
[00:23:18.194 --> 00:23:19.315]  El Paso fighting hunger.
[00:23:19.355 --> 00:23:19.855]  See on the truck?
[00:23:22.077 --> 00:23:25.360]  This is, but they think the public's too dumb to realize who's causing the crisis.
[00:23:25.881 --> 00:23:27.442]  So we'll go along with it, but we're not going to.
[00:23:27.482 --> 00:23:31.045]  We're going to blame Biden and the deep state that allowed this lawlessness to take place.
[00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:34.769]  They want to make the entire republic a failed state.
[00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:38.897]  We need to get a hold of this and eradicate this now.
[00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.679]  We need to shut that border down.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.002]  Alright, Pete Santilli, investigative journalist.
[00:23:44.803 --> 00:23:46.805]  Par Excellent joins us on the other side.
[00:23:46.724 --> 00:23:53.724]  Stay with us.
[00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:59.724]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:59.724 --> 00:24:28.724]  [Music]
[00:24:28.724 --> 00:24:34.724]  [Music]
[00:24:34.855 --> 00:24:40.598]  Yeah, we got all the King Charles news and all the Russia war news and end of the dollar news.
[00:24:40.618 --> 00:24:42.099]  We got it all coming up next hour.
[00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:46.541]  But Pete Santilli, incredible investigative journalist, joins us.
[00:24:46.561 --> 00:24:52.664]  He began frantically calling me at about 10 30 yesterday, and I didn't start reading his text later in the afternoon and talk to him.
[00:24:53.484 --> 00:25:02.548]  And he's like, man, they're about to launch terror attacks using the Mexican cartels because they're mad about title 42 ending and Biden's green lit it because he wants to be the hero and he'll be the one to stop it.
[00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:05.720]   But he controls the cartels and Okay, great.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.502]  Let's talk about it next week because he brings a lot of big stuff.
[00:25:08.542 --> 00:25:09.322]  It's always accurate.
[00:25:09.922 --> 00:25:13.684]  Then the shooting starts in North Dallas.
[00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:21.067]  Then a massive truck attack with another Hispanic man running over 25 people, killing at least seven.
[00:25:21.988 --> 00:25:23.148]  We have all the footage of that.
[00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:24.449]  It's not in the national news.
[00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:26.490]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.011]  But Pete has high-level federal sources.
[00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:30.772]  That he has revealed to me.
[00:25:30.792 --> 00:25:31.832]  I already know he has those sources.
[00:25:31.872 --> 00:25:32.813]  I know who the source is.
[00:25:33.373 --> 00:25:35.234]  I have similar sources telling me the same thing.
[00:25:35.714 --> 00:25:38.556]  So explaining what's really going on is how you destabilize the country.
[00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.197]  Say, come out the Second Amendment.
[00:25:40.557 --> 00:25:42.838]  Because the American people just see a bunch of people being killed.
[00:25:42.858 --> 00:25:46.860]  They don't understand that this is how the Mexican drug cartels operate.
[00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:48.881]  This is how the cartels operate, period.
[00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:53.024]  So, Pete, start at the beginning here with the calls you started getting Friday night.
[00:25:53.404 --> 00:25:54.164]  It's on my phone.
[00:25:54.184 --> 00:25:54.765]  It's on record.
[00:25:54.785 --> 00:25:56.125]  You were calling me at, you know, 10, 30, 11 with this.
[00:25:57.426 --> 00:25:58.626]  Hours later it starts happening.
[00:25:58.886 --> 00:26:00.727]  I don't think there's any way to say this is wrong.
[00:26:01.747 --> 00:26:04.408]  Hispanic men randomly shooting up Hispanics.
[00:26:05.388 --> 00:26:09.249]  Randomly running over Hispanics at a migrant center in Brownsville.
[00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:10.549]  I mean, wow.
[00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:20.192]  And it ties into Fast and Furious and Holder and Obama sending hundreds of millions of guns to the Mexican cartels that were later then sold to ISIS.
[00:26:21.827 --> 00:26:22.868]  This is just incredible.
[00:26:22.928 --> 00:26:29.514]  This is the definition of terrorism, the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
[00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:37.301]  Sinaloa and Gulf cartels convened a meeting two and a half weeks ago to decide on launching a terror attacks and mass casualty events in order to stop lifting Title 42.
[00:26:37.561 --> 00:26:41.165]  They do it all over Mexico and Central and South America.
[00:26:41.605 --> 00:26:42.906]  Why wouldn't they do it here?
[00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:46.690]  Why would Hispanic males start randomly killing Hispanics?
[00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:51.453]  Because their wives, their daughters, their fathers, their uncles are held captive.
[00:26:51.493 --> 00:26:52.474]  That's what I would speculate.
[00:26:52.754 --> 00:26:53.815]  It's how the cartels work.
[00:26:54.435 --> 00:26:56.877]  Pete Santilli, incredible information, dead on.
[00:26:57.738 --> 00:26:58.478]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:16.151]  You know, originally, when the report came from an insider that was actually in the room, as they say, but at the compound, where an unprecedented meeting took place, where the Gulf Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel got together.
[00:27:16.391 --> 00:27:17.392]  Why is that unprecedented?
[00:27:17.432 --> 00:27:21.096]  Well, rival cartels don't typically get together to plan events.
[00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:22.258]  They're against each other.
[00:27:22.278 --> 00:27:23.699]  They're killing each other.
[00:27:23.779 --> 00:27:33.010]  But it was actually about a week and a half or so ago when that meeting took place, a call went to my source.
[00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:39.554]  And he found it to be unbelievable, but really didn't take it as seriously as it should have been.
[00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:56.386]  But he got a call, I think it was on Friday night in advance, telling him, now this wasn't supposed to come forward, I had to actually ask because it's a matter of such high public importance, this is a terroristic event, so I said we need to make this stuff public.
[00:27:56.406 --> 00:27:57.667]  By the way, let me just back you up.
[00:27:57.727 --> 00:27:58.687]  This is so bad.
[00:27:59.528 --> 00:28:03.292]  That I had meetings two weeks ago with top federal officials.
[00:28:03.332 --> 00:28:04.773]  I mean, people would know who they are, I said.
[00:28:05.234 --> 00:28:10.238]  So that's how concerned they are, telling me basically lawlessness is about to break out, the cartels are about to attack.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.181]  They didn't go as far as you were with the specifics.
[00:28:13.502 --> 00:28:14.743]  They just said, what can you do?
[00:28:14.803 --> 00:28:15.664]  We're calling everyone.
[00:28:15.684 --> 00:28:20.208]  And I said, we're not making this up.
[00:28:20.268 --> 00:28:36.530]   There was a warning to my source who Uh, essentially was told, uh, you need to have full situational awareness, uh, level 10, you know, keep your head on a swivel, don't go to grocery stores, and this person is not down on the border.
[00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:53.981]   Uh, they were planning to launch Major events, mass casualty events, and then basically blame it on this mass migration that's taking place to stop the Title 42, because the cartels have tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars at stake.
[00:28:54.341 --> 00:29:00.284]  Now, of course, we know who's behind that, allowing it, the regime that's in place, Obama, you know, 2, 3, 4.0.
[00:29:01.384 --> 00:29:05.026]  And obviously, they knew the cartels would do this when they're cash cow.
[00:29:05.246 --> 00:29:08.007]  They make more money off human smuggling than off everything else.
[00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:13.272]   And for those who don't know, The average person three, four, five times goes back and forth in a revolving door.
[00:29:13.693 --> 00:29:14.754]  That's where the real money's at.
[00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:16.957]  Absolutely.
[00:29:17.017 --> 00:29:22.043]  Now, this is effectively at two of the top cartels.
[00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:36.866]  One which controls the border and the other of course down below the border that have essentially decided to launch terror attacks on the United States in order to affect political policy with respect to lifting Title 42.
[00:29:37.786 --> 00:29:42.986]   That, when you couple that with what we know about Eric Holder and Fast and Furious and
[00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:48.905]   supplying guns down there and the deep infiltration, if not collusion, with the cartels, especially
[00:29:48.905 --> 00:29:51.305]  with respect to human trafficking, sex trafficking.
[00:29:51.305 --> 00:29:56.664]   Shoot, I was down on the border of McAllen, Texas in 2014 and saw them funneling, you
[00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:57.664]  know, children.
[00:29:57.664 --> 00:30:01.345]   They get their pick of the litter, of course, and they send them to the Catholic charities
[00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:04.786]   and then, of course, distribute them throughout the entire country.
[00:30:04.817 --> 00:30:05.918]  It's been going on for many years.
[00:30:06.139 --> 00:30:11.945]  But we've now gotten to the point where this weapon of mass migration coming up to the border.
[00:30:12.246 --> 00:30:17.612]  If Title 42 is lifted and people are just allowed to walk across the border unchecked.
[00:30:18.072 --> 00:30:25.014]  The tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, will go away that's in the hands of these cartels.
[00:30:25.234 --> 00:30:26.614]  And that's why they're launching this attack.
[00:30:26.914 --> 00:30:36.216]  And that's why they want it, but why does Obama, the real president, who stole the election, why in Obama's third term with the puppet Biden, why is he doing it?
[00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:36.736]  Well, it's simple.
[00:30:37.036 --> 00:30:44.798]  They can blame the Second Amendment, call for gun confiscation, as Biden just did an hour and a half ago, two hours ago, and then later bring in a new Title 42.
[00:30:47.327 --> 00:30:47.967]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:30:48.007 --> 00:30:50.528]  Now, the cartels, a lot of rumors out there.
[00:30:50.588 --> 00:30:55.329]  Now, this is the way it came to me, is that there were imminent attacks that were already predetermined.
[00:30:56.649 --> 00:30:58.270]  They're not necessarily going to blame it on the cartels.
[00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.670]  They're going to blame it on the migrants.
[00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.091]  That's the way it was told to me before the Saturday events came.
[00:31:05.451 --> 00:31:06.892]  And I was told that they were imminent.
[00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:07.812]  And they happened.
[00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:09.612]  And I was like, holy cow.
[00:31:09.913 --> 00:31:11.573]  I mean, look at my text messages.
[00:31:11.593 --> 00:31:13.693]  You're on record before this happened, saying it was going to happen.
[00:31:13.974 --> 00:31:15.594]  And then the truck attack just confirms it.
[00:31:16.724 --> 00:31:18.265]  Yeah, and then another truck attack.
[00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:20.086]  And I'm being told that this is nothing.
[00:31:20.106 --> 00:31:21.327]  There's going to be a massive wave.
[00:31:21.387 --> 00:31:23.988]  There's going to be no doubt about the pressure for Joe Biden.
[00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:25.970]  Now, this is a total twofold effort.
[00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:35.175]  They're going to try to also never let a good crisis go to waste and make Biden look like he's going to clamp down on the border and shut down the mass migration.
[00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:38.797]  Because they know the public doesn't have a memory that he said, if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[00:31:39.238 --> 00:31:41.859]  Once it peaks and until it collapses, then he poses as a savior.
[00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:42.840]  Makes perfect sense.
[00:31:43.932 --> 00:32:01.287]  It's just like a triple false flag going on to make Biden look halfway decent for political purposes, shut down the border, make sure the cartels maintain their dominance in gun running, sex trafficking, human trafficking, so on and so forth.
[00:32:01.507 --> 00:32:02.728]  Now, here's another concern.
[00:32:02.748 --> 00:32:05.951]  I've been talking to Michael Yan, of course, supplementing the work that he's been doing on your show.
[00:32:07.563 --> 00:32:09.947]  Yesterday I conducted an interview with him.
[00:32:09.967 --> 00:32:12.833]  He is a famous reporter, former special operations guy.
[00:32:12.853 --> 00:32:14.135]  That's right.
[00:32:14.296 --> 00:32:15.077]  He never gets mad.
[00:32:15.097 --> 00:32:15.819]  He's really upset.
[00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:17.903]  He's been out at the Darien Gap.
[00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:25.273]  Down in the Darien Gap, Special Forces operator, a great journalist, photographer, traveling all over the world.
[00:32:25.293 --> 00:32:32.438]  He's been everywhere from Hong Kong to Iraq, Afghanistan, one of the best investigative journalists of our age.
[00:32:32.738 --> 00:32:42.184]  He's listening down at the Darien Gap, and you had him live on the air talking to a Chinese national, but he's also listening to those around him.
[00:32:42.385 --> 00:32:44.586]  He just got footage he put on Twitter yesterday.
[00:32:44.626 --> 00:32:45.106]  We should play it.
[00:32:45.146 --> 00:32:45.927]  It's on my list to play.
[00:32:45.947 --> 00:32:46.888]  We have too much video to play.
[00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:55.212]  He saw dozens of Chinese meetings with a party official saying, okay, members of the party, they're having a communist meeting right there at the Darien Gap.
[00:32:56.633 --> 00:32:57.973]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:32:58.413 --> 00:33:03.116]  That coupled with what he sounded the alarm on yesterday in my interview.
[00:33:03.716 --> 00:33:05.297]  It's not shocking.
[00:33:05.517 --> 00:33:09.019]  It's just a high level of alert that we need to understand where we're at.
[00:33:09.199 --> 00:33:16.142]  And explain the cell phones, because they're handing them all UN cell phones and prepaid debit cards so they can coordinate and have operational control.
[00:33:16.503 --> 00:33:17.283]  Explain what that means.
[00:33:18.123 --> 00:33:18.523]  That's right.
[00:33:18.583 --> 00:33:26.147]  They can actually deploy, because they have direct contact, even micro-targeting, and deploy people to come to your house and take it over.
[00:33:26.788 --> 00:33:30.049]  They can send a text, one move, thousand people at your house.
[00:33:30.189 --> 00:33:31.090]  So this is Red Dawn.
[00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.451]  In Red Dawn, they parachute in.
[00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:34.752]  In the 21st century, this is how they infiltrate.
[00:33:37.391 --> 00:33:46.037]  I hate to pick on the front face of it, which is just Obama, but there's an entire regime from Obama to Eric Holder to Susan Rice, this communist regime.
[00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:51.581]  We're showing on the screen all the big banks giving free $5,000 debit cards to everybody to come here.
[00:33:51.601 --> 00:33:52.921]  I mean, this is all government-run.
[00:33:53.062 --> 00:33:55.843]  You know, imagine, Alex, picture this.
[00:33:57.404 --> 00:34:04.449]  Right now, we're seeing through Michael Young's footage out of the Darien Gap, we're seeing massive tent cities.
[00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:19.338]  These tent cities down in the Darien Gap and hopscotching all the way up, they have brand new, with UNICEF logos on it, UN logos on it, EU logos on it, United States of America flags on it.
[00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:20.559]  This is modern warfare.
[00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.341]  This is government-directed collapse.
[00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.251]  Now imagine that all of these migrants have all these great brand new facilities.
[00:34:29.691 --> 00:34:31.572]  They've got brand new buses, air-conditioned.
[00:34:31.832 --> 00:34:34.253]  These people are living in a lap of luxury.
[00:34:34.653 --> 00:34:38.994]  Isn't it amazing how they get to the border and they're dumped in the streets of America?
[00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:45.377]  And the cartel is saying, they gotta pay us money, we're gonna start killing them if they don't pay us money.
[00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:46.177]  That's why they're threatened.
[00:34:47.592 --> 00:34:47.973]  That's right.
[00:34:48.033 --> 00:34:56.119]  Now, UNICEF, they're handing out, the UN organizations are handing out condoms because they know all these women are getting raped.
[00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:02.384]  Not only are they getting raped, and that is the perfect picture right there, on all these brand new tent cities.
[00:35:02.565 --> 00:35:06.248]  These migrants coming up, they're paying, some of the Chinese are paying upwards of $50,000.
[00:35:06.608 --> 00:35:09.730]  That's right, the lowest is $7,000, the highest is $50,000.
[00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:11.692]  So it says UNICEF, the U.S., and the EU.
[00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:13.970]  That's right.
[00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.791]  And they're providing them with all of the resources that they need.
[00:35:17.831 --> 00:35:18.931]  This thing is being fueled.
[00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:20.772]  We're not talking about hundreds of thousands.
[00:35:20.872 --> 00:35:25.453]  There's millions of dollars that are going towards bringing these migrants up.
[00:35:25.913 --> 00:35:27.633]  By the way, this just happened this morning.
[00:35:27.653 --> 00:35:30.774]  You can see on the side of the car, it says El Paso.
[00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:32.235]  This is El Paso.
[00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:33.595]  Look at the lower right-hand corner, folks.
[00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:35.956]  This is El Paso today.
[00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:38.257]  This is the insanity happening right now.
[00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:41.078]  And imagine what's Title 42 next Thursday.
[00:35:41.398 --> 00:35:43.439]  We're going to be there on the ground in El Paso.
[00:35:43.479 --> 00:35:44.519]  Imagine what's going to happen then.
[00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:45.599]  Pete Santelli.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.040]  Now it's above my pay grade.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.461]  I think that the powers that be.
[00:35:50.262 --> 00:36:01.757]  Whoever was able to convene an unprecedented meeting between the Gulf Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel, whoever makes that call to make that happen, that's way above my pay grade.
[00:36:02.018 --> 00:36:05.142]  There must be a battle going on where both sides are pushing.
[00:36:05.422 --> 00:36:12.587]  You got the black hats that are saying we still want to make money on the illegal activity, and you guys are allowing it to be legalized.
[00:36:12.928 --> 00:36:13.808]  There's a conflict here.
[00:36:13.928 --> 00:36:19.773]  I don't know what's happening, but all I do know is that the chaos that's being created is initiated.
[00:36:19.973 --> 00:36:27.198]  This is not some spontaneous... Yeah, why would a random Hispanic man bravler people with a truck in Brownsville?
[00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:31.041]  Why would a Hispanic man go shoot a bunch of Hispanics, Latinos?
[00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:33.223]  No, no, this is how the cartels work.
[00:36:33.383 --> 00:36:34.524]  Have their families been kidnapped?
[00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:51.863]  Now, even within the, even within the, if you have a source that's in the room that knows about this meeting taking place, and when these folks, insiders, are concerned about what's going on, that means that there's a call above their pay grade.
[00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:53.645]  Something huge is going on here.
[00:36:54.466 --> 00:37:00.793]  When they start making calls like that, breaking operational security, to warn their friends.
[00:37:00.853 --> 00:37:01.253]  Exactly.
[00:37:01.273 --> 00:37:06.259]  Why would top federal officials two weeks ago meet with me, saying you've got to do something, what do we do?
[00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:08.821]  Because everybody, I was telling them, I don't know what to do.
[00:37:09.362 --> 00:37:10.623]  They thought I would know the answer.
[00:37:10.804 --> 00:37:11.765]  This is like insane.
[00:37:12.844 --> 00:37:15.845]  You know, Alex, I mentioned it to you earlier.
[00:37:16.045 --> 00:37:26.807]  I want to get away from, I don't want to use the leftist tactic where after a mass shooting, you know, to start pointing our energy at the gun and say we need to disarm everybody.
[00:37:27.127 --> 00:37:28.368]  It's the person behind the gun.
[00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:40.370]  We have to resist that temptation using the Second Amendment or the, you know, the assault rifle analogy to not yell at the white buildings in Washington, D.C.
[00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:43.572]   and our bureaucratic institutions Because that's the gun.
[00:37:44.052 --> 00:37:47.874]  It is a well-oiled machine, it's very powerful, and it's designed and used to go get bad guys.
[00:37:48.234 --> 00:37:49.354]  Like the FBI and the CIA.
[00:37:49.374 --> 00:37:50.075]  No, I agree.
[00:37:50.095 --> 00:37:53.096]  There's a battle over our agencies, over our government.
[00:37:53.376 --> 00:37:54.797]  The government's not the enemy.
[00:37:55.077 --> 00:37:56.658]  It's the criminals that have hijacked it.
[00:37:57.463 --> 00:38:01.427]  Those agencies are now being weaponized and pointed towards the American people.
[00:38:01.447 --> 00:38:15.979]  We got white hats within the FBI, within the CIA, I do know this, that they want to help save our country, but I'll tell you what, they don't know how the black hats are operating their communications operationally.
[00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:17.100]  You know how they're communicating?
[00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:28.534]   I found out through sources, they're talking Alex Jones On child porn servers, that the FBI is running on government property.
[00:38:28.554 --> 00:38:29.135]  How did they find this out?
[00:38:29.155 --> 00:38:30.918]  That came out in the news three weeks ago, exactly.
[00:38:32.337 --> 00:38:33.137]  Guess who uncovered it?
[00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:37.980]  Norm Pattis was the one that exposed it, I think maybe a couple years ago.
[00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:45.025]  Norm Pattis was the one that exposed that the FBI was running child porn servers on government property.
[00:38:45.426 --> 00:38:50.809]  From that, we now discovered that that's how they're communicating their operational orders, is in the chat rooms.
[00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.771]  They're communicating on gaming chat rooms.
[00:38:54.312 --> 00:38:56.833]  But that came out in the congressional hearings a month and a half ago.
[00:38:57.374 --> 00:38:58.935]  They're using illegal chat rooms.
[00:39:00.293 --> 00:39:00.793]  That's correct.
[00:39:00.813 --> 00:39:02.315]  They're using illegal chat rooms.
[00:39:02.455 --> 00:39:03.456]  That's how they're communicating.
[00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:20.950]  So our white hats within the system know that they're abusing the power of the full force of the government and these investigations going on at the FBI, setting up child porn servers under the pretext of conducting investigations, and they're doing it on government property.
[00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:27.555]  Go take a look at the chat rooms and see what their next plans are, because that's where it's happening.
[00:39:27.795 --> 00:39:28.596]  Why do they do that?
[00:39:28.876 --> 00:39:29.797]  Because guess what?
[00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:32.694]  I was actually almost entrapped.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:39.682]  To convey, I wanted to take a screenshot of some evidence of what website they were using.
[00:39:40.022 --> 00:39:46.044]  And if I had fallen into that trap, I would have been arrested for dissemination of child pornography.
[00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:49.746]  The reason why they do this is they can do it because nobody else can go in there.
[00:39:49.786 --> 00:39:53.447]  It's illegal to go into these child porn websites.
[00:39:53.727 --> 00:39:55.208]  Another one is the gaming chat rooms.
[00:39:55.708 --> 00:40:03.347]   Norm Eisen, Neil Keitel, Mark Elias, they were running ballot stuffing operations
[00:40:03.347 --> 00:40:05.387]  prior to 2020, I published an article.
[00:40:05.387 --> 00:40:10.108]  So these black operatives are communicating their orders.
[00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:14.547]   We're wondering how they're able to affect all these false flag operations,
[00:40:14.547 --> 00:40:20.847]   how they're able to steamroll people like Alex Jones and Sandy Hook trials.
[00:40:20.847 --> 00:40:26.447]   They're able to communicate in black channels, they're able to subvert the constitution,
[00:40:26.447 --> 00:40:35.228]   they're able to cherry pick all of your communications and communicate it to either opposing council or whatever.
[00:40:35.228 --> 00:40:36.807]  They're doing it behind the scenes.
[00:40:36.807 --> 00:40:41.467]   They are a lawless group of criminals who believe they're invincible and they've made their move.
[00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.610]  They're committed.
[00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.410]  So let me ask you this.
[00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.871]  What are they going to do next?
[00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:46.112]  Because the border is collapsing.
[00:40:46.492 --> 00:40:49.693]  And once it totally collapses, how does Biden look good?
[00:40:49.733 --> 00:40:51.113]  Well, he poses as a savior.
[00:40:51.133 --> 00:40:52.394]  And that's what they're doing now.
[00:40:54.349 --> 00:41:01.413]  He does pose as a savior, but Biden is a puppet, he is a tool.
[00:41:01.853 --> 00:41:08.256]  We have to recognize their methodology, that Hegelian dialectic, never let a crisis go to waste.
[00:41:08.636 --> 00:41:12.178]  Everybody needs to get educated on the chaos that's always created.
[00:41:12.198 --> 00:41:13.659]  So what do you think is coming next?
[00:41:14.199 --> 00:41:15.780]  A truck attack in Brownsville?
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.581]  A mass shooting in Dallas?
[00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:18.862]  You called it was going to happen.
[00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:21.563]  What does the Deep State want to get out of this?
[00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:24.744]  Because Biden already came out two hours ago and said we're taking your guns.
[00:41:27.005 --> 00:41:35.168]  I believe that there are going to be, and this is just what I'm being told, is that we have seen nothing yet.
[00:41:35.248 --> 00:41:37.328]  This is not going to be isolated to the border.
[00:41:37.608 --> 00:41:39.109]  This is going to happen across the country.
[00:41:39.849 --> 00:41:48.998]   I'm expecting, I can fully expect, because My source was told stay out of the grocery stores and he didn't tell me this information to bring it public.
[00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:53.804]  He was told this information for his own personal safety and he's nowhere near the border.
[00:41:54.104 --> 00:41:59.711]  I'm expecting that we're going to see major attacks like this that have been initiated by the cartels.
[00:41:59.971 --> 00:42:01.313]  You won't see it as a cartel event.
[00:42:01.653 --> 00:42:14.121]  But it's going to be blamed on the migrants and it's going to happen in major cities across the country to get that full imagery in effect to give Biden that opportunity to exploit the crisis that they in fact created.
[00:42:14.482 --> 00:42:19.425]  His regime, Obama-Biden regime, is behind all of this.
[00:42:19.765 --> 00:42:20.946]  They're doing it secretly.
[00:42:20.986 --> 00:42:28.211]   They're having open meetings and even the insiders within these groups Uh, know that orders are coming from higher above.
[00:42:28.511 --> 00:42:32.653]  I'm being told that these cartels know that it's coming from higher above.
[00:42:32.673 --> 00:42:40.557]  Well again, why would a clean-cut Hispanic man, looks military, ram a car over a bunch of people and kill seven or eight people today?
[00:42:41.038 --> 00:42:46.961]  Why would a Hispanic man with a security clearance, an armed security guard, go attack and kill Hispanics?
[00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:49.082]  That's what the cartels want folks to know.
[00:42:49.142 --> 00:42:50.463]  You don't pay us money, we kill you.
[00:42:52.065 --> 00:42:58.229]  Yeah, I don't know exactly what the front face of this thing is going to be, but I know who's behind it.
[00:42:58.269 --> 00:42:59.830]  It's going to be the cartels.
[00:43:00.131 --> 00:43:01.892]  The cartels are going to claim credit for it.
[00:43:02.312 --> 00:43:04.473]  They're going to blame it on the migrants.
[00:43:04.974 --> 00:43:09.457]  They're going to blame it on the migrants and the criminals that are hiding, just like the Palestinians.
[00:43:10.698 --> 00:43:16.822]  Very sympathetically, the Palestinians that are poor, they're shillers, they're throwing rocks, but they're used as human shields.
[00:43:17.242 --> 00:43:23.829]  These migrants are going to be used as human shields for a very nefarious criminal entity that's going to come up through the border.
[00:43:24.089 --> 00:43:25.390]  And that's who they're going to blame it on.
[00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.052]  That terrorists are coming over.
[00:43:27.292 --> 00:43:31.756]  That these very dangerous criminals, like MS-13 gang members, are coming over the border.
[00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:35.079]  Why they use this guy, it's perplexing to me.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.442]  So they heat up the crisis, they open the border.
[00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:42.810]  And then right when the border collapses, they go, oh, we're going to fix the border by taking all of your rides.
[00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.233]  Pete Santilli, it makes perfect sense.
[00:43:44.714 --> 00:43:47.959]  We'll talk to you again in the next few days on the weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:43:47.999 --> 00:43:48.420]  to 3 p.m.

[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.501]  Thank you so much.
[00:43:49.922 --> 00:43:50.824]  Pete, how do they find your show?
[00:43:52.202 --> 00:43:54.283]  PeteLive.tv.

[00:43:55.444 --> 00:43:56.625]  PeteLive.tv.

[00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:05.730]  It's amazing.

[00:44:09.732 --> 00:44:11.834]  It's the products that fund us, plus their amazing products.
[00:44:12.314 --> 00:44:13.915]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:13.775 --> 00:44:15.775]  .com. We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:44:15.775 --> 00:44:26.034]  back to you right away.
[00:44:24.146 --> 00:44:25.368]  Our number two, Pete Santilli.
[00:44:25.388 --> 00:44:26.529]  He's got more to add.
[00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.371]  Pete, take it over.
[00:44:29.284 --> 00:44:50.661]  You know, Michael Yan yesterday, who I have so much respect for, and as a Special Forces operator, as a former United States Marine, his level of expertise, you know, on the ground as a Special Forces operator, as a Green Beret, when he sounds the alert, I'm going to honor him and I'm going to repeat it.
[00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:56.686]   And I'm going to say this, because I don't want to be overly sensational or cause You know, any fear or panic.
[00:44:56.946 --> 00:44:59.388]  But everybody needs to wake up to the following.
[00:44:59.648 --> 00:45:02.409]  You need to have full situational awareness as well.
[00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.291]  You need to recognize what's happening.
[00:45:04.631 --> 00:45:08.413]  And for every day that you don't, that's the desired effect.
[00:45:08.753 --> 00:45:11.595]  They don't want you to know what's happening around you.
[00:45:11.955 --> 00:45:15.059]  They don't want you to know what fifth-generational warfare is.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.646]  Fifth-generational warfare is warfare being perpetrated upon you psychologically.
[00:45:19.666 --> 00:45:22.750]  They're not even firing a shot, so you don't think it's warfare.
[00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:29.359]  That gives them one more day to plan operationally and get away with advancing their agenda.
[00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:43.053]  Everybody needs to wake up if you are lawfully a concealed carry and you're thinking about going to the grocery store and you normally, you know, maybe you leave your, you know, you let your guard down.
[00:45:43.333 --> 00:45:44.915]  Don't let your guard down.
[00:45:45.015 --> 00:45:46.376]  You're at level 10 right now.
[00:45:46.737 --> 00:45:48.899]  Everybody be on the alert as to what's happening.
[00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:51.291]  You need to know what's happening.
[00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:51.531]  Why?
[00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:52.652]  Because, I'll give you an example.
[00:45:52.672 --> 00:46:00.253]  Do you remember when they attacked Tucker Carlson because he brought up the conspiracy theory of replacement migration?
[00:46:01.014 --> 00:46:02.394]  They call him a conspiracy theorist.
[00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.214]  Well, they had operational plans in place.
[00:46:04.554 --> 00:46:10.556]  UN has a 177 page document on replacement migration.
[00:46:10.836 --> 00:46:15.457]  Large portion of which, how they're going to replace Americans because of our aging population.
[00:46:15.777 --> 00:46:26.969]   On one hand, they're of course causing us to become A bunch of homosexuals and basically non-reproducing drag queens.
[00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:29.052]  You're not going to get babies that way.
[00:46:29.132 --> 00:46:32.537]  And then they're going to replace us because we're not having enough children.
[00:46:32.798 --> 00:46:34.781]  So, do not let your guard down.
[00:46:34.881 --> 00:46:46.531]   Have full Situational awareness of what's happening and know that there's a reason why they're giving cell phones to every single one of these migrants that are coming over the border.
[00:46:46.911 --> 00:46:53.933]  And it's not to send them health care apps and to keep give them warm and fuzzies.
[00:46:54.373 --> 00:46:57.733]  It's to extract because the majority of these migrants are human shields.
[00:46:57.974 --> 00:47:01.094]  They're being exploited for human and sex trafficking.
[00:47:01.534 --> 00:47:15.187]   They are the human shield to this thing that also includes Military-aged men that can now receive their communications device here on the ground as soon as they come in and make contact with our government authorities.
[00:47:15.327 --> 00:47:24.291]  And, of course, the good folks, the white hats at the DHS and the Border Patrol, they think it's neat that they have these phones and they're helping to facilitate this thing.
[00:47:24.472 --> 00:47:25.172]  Well, guess what?
[00:47:25.652 --> 00:47:35.165]  These people that have been operating behind the scenes to destroy our country, communicating covertly, launching false flag attacks, using gaming channels.
[00:47:35.205 --> 00:47:51.516]   By the way, if you think it's a conspiracy theory that gaming chat rooms are used to communicate, By the Intel Services and talk to their good friends over there at ISIS and Al-Qaeda, their operatives at ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:58.541]  Go take a look at what the CIA operators were doing during the attack on Benghazi.
[00:47:58.881 --> 00:47:59.662]  What were they doing?
[00:48:00.603 --> 00:48:04.565]   That one of the top game players on Eve Okay?
[00:48:04.946 --> 00:48:08.208]  During the attack on Benghazi, he was in those chat rooms.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:10.770]  And that's how I discovered these techniques.
[00:48:11.011 --> 00:48:15.754]  And that's how we caught them prior to the November election.
[00:48:16.235 --> 00:48:22.680]  Norm Eisen, Neil Keitel, and Mark Elias were deploying their assets to stuff ballots.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.961]  This is how they communicate.
[00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:27.444]  So, you're not going to get this information in the mainstream media.
[00:48:27.864 --> 00:48:29.465]  We have the best resources.
[00:48:29.905 --> 00:48:31.687]  White hats that know what's going on.
[00:48:31.727 --> 00:48:32.908]  We don't know everything.
