[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.209]  They want ugliness.
[00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.550]  They want ugly architecture.
[00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.470]  They want you to give up.
[00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.270]  They want you to roll over.
[00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.990]  That's the plan.
[00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.790]  You see these movies.
[00:00:05.811 --> 00:00:06.411]  You read these books.
[00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:07.191]  You say, this is ridiculous.
[00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:07.791]  This has never happened.
[00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.252]  This is what happens in authoritarian regimes.
[00:00:10.832 --> 00:00:13.713]  And now with AI and computers, they can do it so much easier.
[00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:26.656]  And they call themselves the liberals, the guardians of culture, the guardians of art, when they are outrageous criminals involved in crimes against humanity.
[00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.494]  British taxpayer-funded anti-extremist study finds Shakespeare, Orwell, Tolkien key texts for white supremacists.
[00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:36.355]  British governments involved.
[00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:41.618]  UK's counter-terrorism program says interest in great literature a sign of far-right extremism.
[00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:49.941]   Lord of the Rings, George Orwell, Shakespeare, The list goes on and on.
[00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:51.401]  It's not satire.
[00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:53.202]  This is not the Babylon Bee.
[00:00:53.823 --> 00:00:55.123]  This is worse than burning books.
[00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:59.585]  This is rewriting them and stealing people's art and stealing their identities.
[00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:09.710]  And the left is a evil worldwide corporate dictatorship of transhumanists with a bunch of useful idiots following along with it, believing they're part of the winning team.
[00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:16.554]  No one on the face of this should go along with any of this garbage.
[00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:26.387]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.286]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:48.286]  [Music]
[00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:50.373]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:56.373]  [Sirens]
[00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:59.373]  [Inaudible]
[00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:02.373]  Well, I told you air raid sirens were coming.
[00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:14.298]  There's Biden marching through Kiev with Zelensky today with air raid sirens, real ones, going off in the background.
[00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:31.700]   And their new minister of defense has called for an invasion of Russia and occupying Moscow that would 100% lead to nuclear war. And Biden has said that the U.S. is with
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.580]  Ukraine and NATO all the way.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.539]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:45.539]   Remind us that freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for for as long as it takes.
[00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.819]  And that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr.
[00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.899]  President, for as long as it takes.
[00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:56.259]  We will do it.
[00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:03.379]   But he won't go visit the collapsed southern border that's a war zone.
[00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:06.405]  He won't go to Ohio in the train wreck or send federal aid.
[00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:13.107]  Doesn't care about the 25 veterans committing suicide a day or the hundreds a day dying from opiates and fentanyl.
[00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:20.808]  Or another Chinese balloon, it's the exact same model, floating over Hawaii right now.
[00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:25.709]  Or all the millions sick and dying from the poison shots.
[00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:28.447]  Because he's a puppet in chief.
[00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.868]  We're going to be covering all that today.
[00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:40.593]  You know, I knew from sources that Tucker Carlson was working very hard behind the scenes on exposing that January 6 was an inside job.
[00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:45.016]  And he had some of his production crew here last week.
[00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:47.277]  I'll just leave it at that here in studio with us.
[00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:55.716]  And I was getting critical of McCarthy saying, where is the January 6 footage?
[00:03:55.776 --> 00:04:01.359]  Well, it turns out he's given all 42,000 hours of it to Tucker Carlson.
[00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:10.005]  And he's directed the Capitol Police to sit there with Carlson's crew, who's working around the clock to go through the 42,000 hours.
[00:04:13.134 --> 00:04:14.435]  Pretty amazing stuff.
[00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:23.020]  Exclusive from Axios, McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to Trove of January 6th riot footage.
[00:04:25.382 --> 00:04:36.769]  And just so happens we already have Jim Hoffman, Gateway Pundit, who's been on this more than anybody, other than Tucker Carlson, to talk about the 15 smoking guns of it being an inside job.
[00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:43.039]  Fifteen facts on the dozens of federal operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th at the U.S.
[00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:48.724]  Capitol, or the hundreds of armed snipers that were there and helped execute the whole operation.
[00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:53.729]  The head of the Gateway Pundit will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour and an hour and a half from now.
[00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.870]  We're going to be looking at all of this.
[00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.433]  It's a big deal because this could really bring down the deep state.
[00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.111]  Also, careful what you ask for.
[00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:06.214]  Fox is in that big multi-billion dollar Dominion voting machine lawsuit.
[00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:09.717]  Turns out in Discovery, they've gotten some interesting documents.
[00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:18.303]  Fox vs. Dominion Discovery docs show employees admitting their products were, quote, riddled with critical bugs leading to incorrect tallies.
[00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:21.386]  Incorrect results.
[00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:24.983]  We've got that news.
[00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:32.165]  Also, ATF leaked documents reveal the Biden regime's plan outside of law to close down gun stores across the nation.
[00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.446]  A really incredible group of stories.
[00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:46.367]   British taxpayer-funded anti-extremist study run by British intelligence finds Shakespeare, Orwell, Tolkien, Key text for white supremacists.
[00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:48.709]  Call for them to be restricted or rewritten.
[00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.951]  And guess what?
[00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:56.556]  The great author that wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and many books that I loved as a child, many books that my children love.
[00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:01.701]  I was just reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory last week to my five-year-old daughter.
[00:06:01.741 --> 00:06:04.063]  We've almost finished the book with nightly chapters.
[00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:07.306]  Instead of burning books, they just rewrite them.
[00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:11.210]  Now the Oompa Loompas are trans and they're not allowed to call somebody fat.
[00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:13.347]  This is beyond book-burning.
[00:06:14.388 --> 00:06:16.348]  It's all coming up today.
[00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:18.609]  And so much more.
[00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:24.051]  Infowars.com, band.video, and newswars.com are the coordinates of freedom.
[00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:27.532]  If you want to beat the New World Order and override their censorship, share those links now.
[00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:49.077]   If you had an analogy or an allegory or a parable where tyranny was symbolized by horses, not picking on horses, he's using that as an allegory, Then the current New World Order system we've got out of the whole history of horses is the Kentucky Derby winner or the Triple Crown winner.
[00:06:49.497 --> 00:06:51.099]  It is the racehorse of racehorses.
[00:06:53.072 --> 00:06:54.473]  It is the tyranny of tyranny.
[00:06:54.993 --> 00:06:59.495]  They are going to rewrite and destroy all literature, all art, all culture.
[00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:01.176]  It's all being run out of the UK.
[00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:03.117]  That's the center of the New World Order.
[00:07:03.717 --> 00:07:10.261]  And a British intelligence-funded report is calling for restricting Tolkien, Orwell, and of course the evil Shakespeare.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.401]  as white supremacy.
[00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:18.405]  They are rewriting all of the author who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's books.
[00:07:18.985 --> 00:07:23.047]  The Oompa Loompas will be trans and so much more.
[00:07:24.989 --> 00:07:32.834]  This isn't just book burning, this is defiling people and great artists and stealing their identities.
[00:07:32.894 --> 00:07:44.278]   And you know, I knew censorship was bad, but when I became the most censored person in the world by the establishment, and patient zero for it, I learned that the worst part is
[00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:49.468]   they can misrepresent what you've said and done and you can't challenge it in those forums in any
[00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:55.439]   way and they literally create a new identity for you or a straw man. Now I've been
[00:07:55.439 --> 00:08:00.100]   prominent enough that enough people have realized that I was a symbol of their attempt at tyranny so
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.798]  I've been defended by a lot of folks.
[00:08:01.962 --> 00:08:08.126]  But for the tens of millions of others that have now been silenced and censored, they don't get to do that because they aren't as prominent.
[00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:13.409]  So, remember, what's done to Alex Jones today is done to Donald Trump tomorrow and done to you next.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.665]  First they came for the, and I did nothing because I wasn't a, then they came for this group and I wasn't one of them, I didn't stand up.
[00:08:21.285 --> 00:08:26.090]  By the time they got to me, well, there was nobody left to stand up.
[00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:33.049]  We have Jim Hoff, the head of Gateway Pundit, who's done, for any print publication, the best job.
[00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:45.718]  Exposed the inside job that was January 6th in his research and his team's research and their tireless dedication to this, which I appreciate because they've helped keep my ass out of the gulag and many others.
[00:08:45.738 --> 00:08:47.820]  And they're fighting for those that are in the gulags.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.522]  Has been used as the blueprint of research for so many.
[00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:57.728]   And now Tucker Carlson, who's For a national talk show host and the best job of exposing January 6th as an inside job.
[00:08:58.448 --> 00:09:00.370]  I knew he was doing a big in-depth investigation.
[00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:05.915]  Some of his crew, his producer, one of his main producers was here last week.
[00:09:05.955 --> 00:09:06.615]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:07.896]  He's with us at the office.
[00:09:08.637 --> 00:09:11.599]  But now it can be discussed because it's in the news.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.641]  Exclusive from Axios.
[00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:18.946]  McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to Trobe of January 6th riot footage.
[00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:31.276]  And Tucker Carlson's people are inside the Capitol, 24 hours a day, pouring over the 40 plus thousand hours of footage, a true Herculean Aegean Stable effort.
[00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:37.618]  And I'm told in the coming weeks and months, you're going to see bombshell after bombshell after bombshell.
[00:09:38.738 --> 00:09:58.095]   I can also tell you from sources inside the Proud Boys trial that's ongoing, they've now entered the fifth week of that, that They're covering up the feds that actually ran the attack and led the attack and that the federal informants admit that the Proud Boys and as well as the Oath Keepers were not planning to attack.
[00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:02.899]  The judge is openly keeping those informants from being able to testify to the truth.
[00:10:04.198 --> 00:10:09.763]  And no one is reporting on it other than Infowars and Gateway Pundit, and soon Tucker Carlson will blow the thing wide open.
[00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:17.451]  CIA operatives with sex operatives infiltrating Proud Boys, planning capital attack documents on them.
[00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:18.992]  This has all been confirmed.
[00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:22.556]  So, CIA.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.401]  And years ago I'd tell you that and you'd say, oh yeah, right.
[00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:28.423]  Now it's like, well yeah, they run the censorship there.
[00:10:28.723 --> 00:10:29.924]  They're everywhere, yeah.
[00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:31.225]  CIA's not something special.
[00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:34.427]  It's like saying, well I drove down the highway and saw a Walmart.
[00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:38.429]  Or I drove down the highway and I saw a buzzard flying around.
[00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:41.191]  Or I drove down the highway and I saw an 18-wheeler.
[00:10:42.072 --> 00:10:44.673]  I drove down the highway and I saw a Burger King.
[00:10:45.974 --> 00:10:47.736]  The CIA is a giant.
[00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:51.144]  Organization, one of 16 intelligence agencies.
[00:10:51.764 --> 00:10:53.106]  It's the biggest and most corrupt.
[00:10:53.847 --> 00:10:59.533]  And all it is is a giant interface for woke terrorists to attack this country and everything decent and good.
[00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:02.276]  But they ran the whole attack.
[00:11:03.437 --> 00:11:06.921]  No doubt we're working with elements of the Secret Service to try to set up Trump and myself.
[00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:10.164]  The Secret Service tried to get me to the head of the line and to lead the march.
[00:11:11.092 --> 00:11:17.353]  Thank God I was confused and just my instinct told me wait 20-30 minutes and try to find out what was going on.
[00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:22.134]  Because how was I supposed to lead hundreds of thousands of people with no police escort?
[00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:24.155]  I was like, this just feels bad.
[00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:25.315]  Let's wait here.
[00:11:25.395 --> 00:11:26.815]  Let's see what Trump's going to do.
[00:11:27.535 --> 00:11:33.316]  And thank God I wasn't there when they first breached or I'd be in a gulag right now, like 800 other people.
[00:11:33.376 --> 00:11:35.157]  But this is just incredible.
[00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:36.197]  That is coming up.
[00:11:36.937 --> 00:11:41.099]  I haven't talked a lot about it the last few months because it's been wading under the surface, but now it's coming to a head.
[00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:43.881]  You're going to get all the exclusive information, as I can tell you.
[00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:51.805]  What you're going to get from Tucker with video evidence from the Capitol is what Jim Hoff, who is the MVP with his crew, of exposing this.
[00:11:51.925 --> 00:11:58.869]  So that's coming up bottom of the next hour, in about an hour and 20 minutes from now.
[00:12:00.842 --> 00:12:17.446]  I also intend to open the phones up on January 6th if you were there and it is what you think of this incredible information and also Biden going to Ukraine, the new defense minister in Ukraine calling for an invasion of Russia and the occupying of Red Square with Ukrainian tanks.
[00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:18.147]  That's a quote.
[00:12:19.507 --> 00:12:25.308]  So this is escalating extremely quickly and so much more here today.
[00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:35.914]   The UN official treaty is now Out to set up a UN-run program over all major healthcare systems in the world and over your body.
[00:12:36.334 --> 00:12:37.975]  A bunch of key smart city news.
[00:12:39.336 --> 00:12:44.459]  The British government and British intelligence involved in trying to ban classical literature.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.502]  They are really jumping the shark here, ladies and gentlemen, but it's actually happening.
[00:12:49.022 --> 00:12:57.367]  Moving to ban and restrict and rewrite William Shakespeare, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory novels, and so much more.
[00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:06.032]  There's also some amazing footage that I saw yesterday, and I've seen even more incredible footage now.
[00:13:06.072 --> 00:13:07.112]  It's an actual news story.
[00:13:08.473 --> 00:13:10.733]  Very close to where my parents live.
[00:13:12.114 --> 00:13:16.454]  I know this because my 18-year-old daughter really loves my parents, so she lives with them.
[00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:19.835]  They've got a bigger house than I do, so she lives with them.
[00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:22.596]  And she saw it happening.
[00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:23.476]  She called me this morning.
[00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:32.249]   They blocked off probably two miles of South Lamar, one of the main thoroughfares in Austin that runs through the middle of the city.
[00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:40.013]  And they had drag racing and cars crashing and police being injured and police being chased off.
[00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:42.034]  Total lawlessness in the streets of Austin.
[00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:46.617]  Texas, less than a mile from where my parents live.
[00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:49.659]  You have fires in the streets, robberies, assaults.
[00:13:50.936 --> 00:13:55.818]  Just fireworks, powerful mortars being shot at police.
[00:13:56.858 --> 00:13:59.239]  And a city councilwoman saw this happening.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.921]  People being caught on fire, just total bedlam.
[00:14:04.462 --> 00:14:06.402]  Again, police cars being attacked, overturned.
[00:14:06.443 --> 00:14:07.403]  It just went on and on.
[00:14:08.643 --> 00:14:16.907]  And it took the city councilwoman more than 30 minutes, 35 minutes to get 911 to answer.
[00:14:16.927 --> 00:14:19.228]  And they said, we can't help you.
[00:14:20.632 --> 00:14:27.335]  So when I talk about what Austin, Texas is like now, it's like Philadelphia, it's like Chicago in many areas.
[00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:39.781]  And if you shoot somebody trying to carjack you, the district attorney, who is an admitted communist put in by George Soros, will indict you, no matter how innocent you are.
[00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:46.204]  And the same is for the judge that found me guilty in the Sandy Hook kangaroo garbage, and then told a jury that I was guilty.
[00:14:47.697 --> 00:14:51.260]  She literally is an anti-George Soros funded creature.
[00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:53.783]  So this is what it's like to live with these folks.
[00:14:53.803 --> 00:14:55.664]  People say, well, why don't you leave Austin?
[00:14:55.804 --> 00:14:56.785]  All our infrastructure is here.
[00:14:57.486 --> 00:14:59.328]  I don't have the money to set up an infrastructure like this.
[00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:00.128]  My crew lives here.
[00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:05.974]  But yes, we live in a city unrecognizable.
[00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:13.080]   for what it was. And when I say they closed off miles of streets, reportedly by the time this
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.399]   ended after several hours, it was backed up four or five miles in each direction.
[00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:26.918]   So imagine just running into something like this on a Friday night when you're trying to get home.
[00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:32.535]  That's exactly what happened to my 18-year-old daughter while this idiocy was going on.
[00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:36.358]  I mean, I'll say this is tame compared to the muggings and the shootings and the stabbings.
[00:15:36.378 --> 00:15:37.199]  Remember last year?
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:49.129]  Two black teens, they were like 17 and 18, just shot up a whole crowd of people in downtown Austin on South Lamar, where South Lamar crosses over by 6th Street.
[00:15:50.111 --> 00:15:51.832]  And they were out the next day.
[00:15:51.892 --> 00:15:55.613]  The district attorney released them because they were black.
[00:15:56.734 --> 00:15:58.294]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:15:58.435 --> 00:15:59.595]  So much huge news.
[00:15:59.615 --> 00:16:06.538]  We'll go to Ukraine and the unbelievable spiraling out of control there and so much more straight ahead on this live Monday broadcast.
[00:16:06.578 --> 00:16:06.998]  Stay with us.
[00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:09.139]  It's Monday, February 20th, 2023.
[00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:10.660]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.662]  I'm going to open the phones up and intersperse news right through to the bottom of the next hour.
[00:16:15.702 --> 00:16:17.943]  I'm going to give the toll free number out here in just a few minutes.
[00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:30.063]  On the specific issue of World War 3 and what you think of Biden's trip over there while ignoring, well not, he's not ignoring, he's helping quarterback as the figurehead of the destruction of our Republic.
[00:16:30.103 --> 00:16:30.943]  Here's the headlines.
[00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:38.468]  World War 3 watch, Ukraine's defense minister calls for invasion of Russia, while British intelligence declares classical literature terrorism.
[00:16:40.569 --> 00:16:42.370]  These are not satire headlines, these are real.
[00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.753]  Biden turns up in Ukraine as disaster in Ohio rages.
[00:16:48.103 --> 00:16:52.966]  Kiev's security chief vows to expel Russian troops from Ukraine's soil and dubs Putin's Hitler's twin.
[00:16:55.148 --> 00:17:01.171]  Escalation in Kiev's security chief vows to invade Russia as Biden visits Ukraine, says they will capture Moscow.
[00:17:03.093 --> 00:17:06.195]  Hungary's Orbán says Europe may end up sending troops to Ukraine.
[00:17:06.215 --> 00:17:06.995]  It's already happening.
[00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:09.577]  America last.
[00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:10.558]  Biden is in Ukraine.
[00:17:10.578 --> 00:17:11.618]  Trump is heading to Ohio.
[00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.120]  Strong reaction to secret Kiev trip.
[00:17:16.653 --> 00:17:21.457]  Biden Secretary of State Blinken announced $1.85 million in aid to Turkey following earthquake.
[00:17:21.937 --> 00:17:23.739]  Administration ignores East Palestine.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.844]  Zelensky warns new evil axis of China and Russia could spark World War III as Xi backs bloodthirsty Putin.
[00:17:33.007 --> 00:17:37.731]  Blinken warns China against providing aid to Russia, says balloon surveillance must never occur again.
[00:17:37.751 --> 00:17:43.656]  Ukraine refugee girl finds San Francisco schools so violent she wants to go back.
[00:17:45.714 --> 00:17:48.557]  Large white balloon spotted northeast over Hawaii.
[00:17:48.597 --> 00:17:49.778]  Air traffic control confirms.
[00:17:50.178 --> 00:17:51.059]  Here's shots of it.
[00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:57.404]  It's the exact same type as the last one shot down on the coast of South Carolina.
[00:18:00.327 --> 00:18:01.328]  So it goes on and on.
[00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:02.849]  That's odd.
[00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:05.892]  Air raid sirens sound off as Joe Biden and Zelensky walk through Kiev.
[00:18:09.639 --> 00:18:11.481]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.500]   Gabbard and Jimmy Dore, Roger Waters for peace, the big peace rally. Russia files
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:22.380]   for UN Nord Stream inquiry. EU will neither confirm nor deny speculations.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:32.259]   That's just some of the news on that front. I want to open the phones up and
[00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:39.020]   get your take on that situation and then this because it's now ripe. It's now all
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:52.928]  They concluded their fake January 6th investigation where they sealed the file for at least 25 years a few months ago and are attempting to seal the 40 plus thousand hours.
[00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:57.271]  But now that McCarthy and the Republicans are in, McCarthy has reportedly made good on his promise.
[00:18:58.635 --> 00:19:00.056]  At least partially, to release the footage.
[00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:06.262]  He's doing what Elon Musk did, where he's giving it in tranches, or in segments, to Matt Taibbi.
[00:19:06.302 --> 00:19:07.883]  That's what Elon Musk is doing.
[00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.307]  And deciding who he exposes and when.
[00:19:11.327 --> 00:19:15.330]  Still hasn't released the Fauci files, as he promised months ago.
[00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:18.893]  But in the case of McCarthy, he's gone further.
[00:19:18.914 --> 00:19:20.195]  Not all the way, but I like it.
[00:19:22.293 --> 00:19:27.535]  Access the 40 plus thousand hours of footage to Tucker Carlson's producers.
[00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:29.835]  He's got a big team, but not big enough.
[00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:30.736]  I mean, a hundred people.
[00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.717]  Couldn't go through that properly, but I'm glad Tucker's on it.
[00:19:34.437 --> 00:19:44.540]  The thing to do is like WikiLeaks does, where they post the tens of thousands of documents online, then the public can crawl through them and find all the nuggets very, very quickly, like with Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:19:46.345 --> 00:19:49.706]  McCarthy gives Tucker Carlson access to trove of January 6th riot tape.
[00:19:50.326 --> 00:20:00.688]  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has given Fox News Tucker Carlson exclusive access to 41,000, I thought it was 42,000, hours of Capitol surveillance footage from the January 6th riot.
[00:20:01.108 --> 00:20:02.268]  McCarthy sources tell me.
[00:20:02.728 --> 00:20:10.349]  Carlson TV producers were on Capitol Hill last night to begin digging through the trove, which includes multiple camera angles from all the Capitol grounds.
[00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.110]  Excerpts will begin airing in the coming weeks.
[00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:24.851]  Why it matters is it's an inside job, and that ties into this big report with Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:31.054]  15 facts on the dozens of federal operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th at the US Capitol.
[00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:33.435]  This is a big deal.
[00:20:35.316 --> 00:20:39.517]  And that is coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:42.339]  But I want to give the toll-free number out.
[00:20:43.835 --> 00:20:53.357]  On Biden's visit, on January 6th, and on this subject that I'm going to cover next, and then to your calls.
[00:20:54.777 --> 00:20:59.518]  Now, we become accustomed, even myself, and I know a lot of you as well, to living in this tyranny.
[00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:00.238]  It's how we cope.
[00:21:00.278 --> 00:21:10.500]  We fight it, we resist it, we speak out against it, we try to build a better world to compete with it, and that's the big answer, is to build our own good, positive little microcosms that others can see and follow by example.
[00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.261]  We can follow their example when it's good.
[00:21:13.157 --> 00:21:13.697]  Competition.
[00:21:15.659 --> 00:21:29.667]  But I knew when they came out with Shazam over a decade ago, that app where you can hold up your phone at the mall and it would tell you in seconds what a song was, they could use that to then voice print somebody, not just a song, and then erase it off the web and off the cloud.
[00:21:29.687 --> 00:21:33.670]  Because things aren't really held on private servers anymore, they're held in the cloud.
[00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.531]  And now indeed they can go through and erase things across the web whenever they want.
[00:21:37.252 --> 00:21:38.773]  You re-upload it, they take it back down.
[00:21:40.267 --> 00:21:44.291]  Now they aren't just doing this in the US or the UK, they're doing it all over the world.
[00:21:47.073 --> 00:21:57.882]  Private publishers and governments are going in and saying that book is improper and the publishers are then having them rewritten to be politically correct.
[00:21:58.962 --> 00:22:07.321]   So that's what Stalin would do after he'd kill or imprison one of his former aides or generals,
[00:22:07.321 --> 00:22:14.042]   minions, they would just airbrush their photos out of the newspaper.
[00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:21.442]   And so every dystopic film, book, the famous Fahrenheit book that deals with this,
[00:22:21.442 --> 00:22:30.722]   Fahrenheit 451, Equilibrium, it's an excellent movie, with Christian Bale, they want ugliness.
[00:22:30.736 --> 00:22:32.017]  They want ugly architecture.
[00:22:32.097 --> 00:22:32.937]  They want you to give up.
[00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:33.758]  They want you to roll over.
[00:22:33.798 --> 00:22:34.458]  That's the plan.
[00:22:34.518 --> 00:22:35.278]  You see these movies.
[00:22:35.298 --> 00:22:35.899]  You read these books.
[00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:36.659]  You say, this is ridiculous.
[00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:37.279]  This has never happened.
[00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:39.740]  This is what happens in authoritarian regimes.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.182]  And now with AI and computers, they can do it so much easier.
[00:22:43.702 --> 00:22:56.147]  And they call themselves the liberals, the guardians of culture, the guardians of art, when they are outrageous criminals involved in crimes against humanity.
[00:22:57.298 --> 00:23:03.984]  British taxpayer-funded anti-extremist study finds Shakespeare, Orwell, Tolkien key texts for white supremacists.
[00:23:04.745 --> 00:23:05.826]  British governments involved.
[00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:11.110]  UK's counter-terrorism program says interest in great literature, a sign of far-right extremism.
[00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:19.432]   Lord of the Rings, George Orwell, Shakespeare, The list goes on and on.
[00:23:19.872 --> 00:23:20.873]  It's not satire.
[00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:22.675]  This is not the Babylon Bee.
[00:23:23.315 --> 00:23:24.596]  This is worse than burning books.
[00:23:25.317 --> 00:23:29.060]  This is rewriting them and stealing people's art and stealing their identities.
[00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:39.188]  And the left is a evil worldwide corporate dictatorship of transhumanists with a bunch of useful idiots following along with it, believing they're part of the winning team.
[00:23:40.229 --> 00:23:46.054]  No one on the face of this should go along with any of this garbage.
[00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.493]  Roland Dahl's books rewritten to remove language deemed offensive.
[00:23:51.533 --> 00:23:52.194]  London Guardian.
[00:23:53.134 --> 00:23:54.396]  Oompa Loompas are trans.
[00:23:55.597 --> 00:23:58.419]  You can't call Violet mean or call the other girl fat.
[00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:01.482]  You can't call people mom and dad.
[00:24:02.744 --> 00:24:04.805]  What a sick cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:06.067 --> 00:24:07.088]  Absurd censorship.
[00:24:07.108 --> 00:24:11.352]  You can publish your slam for making countless changes to Roland Dahl's books.
[00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:18.909]  He's internationally known for pinning children's classics such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach.
[00:24:19.329 --> 00:24:20.069]  I loved all those books.
[00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:22.150]  Fantastic Mr. Fox and many others.
[00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.331]  However, it looks like the new editions of his works have been altered.
[00:24:25.771 --> 00:24:33.033]  Critics have lashed out at the changes to the children's books by the British publisher, accusing it of distorting the context of the author's words.
[00:24:33.053 --> 00:24:34.234]  Well, they're not distorting it.
[00:24:34.814 --> 00:24:37.195]  They're lying to people and saying it's his work.
[00:24:37.995 --> 00:24:39.576]  When it's not, you think he approved of this?
[00:24:39.876 --> 00:24:43.237]  Think he could have ever imagined something like this would be going on?
[00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:45.958]  More on this, and I'll give out the number when we come back.
[00:24:46.738 --> 00:24:47.558]  Stop the censors.
[00:24:47.618 --> 00:24:48.198]  Spread the link.
[00:24:48.338 --> 00:24:49.639]  InfoWars.com.
[00:24:50.939 --> 00:24:56.021]  Well, Ben Garrison is the most prolific political cartoonist of our lifetime.
[00:24:59.622 --> 00:25:01.843]  He sands down the most popular and the most truthful.
[00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:13.872]  And he put an image last week that's up on Infowars.com that shows the well of knowledge in the center square of an Ivy League university with a big trans-rainbow flag flying up in the background.
[00:25:14.693 --> 00:25:23.955]  And it shows the dean with a big urn of poison lies, woke lies, dumping it into the well to kill the well of knowledge.
[00:25:24.015 --> 00:25:29.116]  And that's what the fuzzy math 2 plus 2 equals 10 and all the rest of it's about.
[00:25:30.782 --> 00:25:38.706]  Thousands of so-called independent school districts around the country don't have one student that can pass a reading, writing, or arithmetic test.
[00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:45.409]  That's right, there are thousands of schools where not one student in whole grades can pass.
[00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:48.590]  That's how you overturn a society is you dumb people down.
[00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.611]  You don't teach them knowledge, or business, or life, or morals.
[00:25:52.132 --> 00:25:59.355]  You teach them how to have a chip on their shoulder and be part of a different organization or group in the mob that the government controls.
[00:26:00.953 --> 00:26:02.434]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:06.797]  Right here, this image says it all.
[00:26:07.658 --> 00:26:23.309]  Now, imagine British intelligence funding studies saying that Shakespeare, Tolkien, Orwell, are bad.
[00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:28.213]  And the publishers immediately get in line and say, we'll rewrite everything.
[00:26:29.437 --> 00:26:31.399]  Did those authors say you could rewrite their books?
[00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:32.780]  Is it still that author's book?
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.020]  No.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.421]  It's a fraud.
[00:26:35.902 --> 00:26:38.824]  And it's beyond book-burning, and it's next-level evil.
[00:26:39.425 --> 00:26:45.069]  British taxpayer-funded anti-extremist study finds Shakespeare, Orwell, Tolkien key texts for white supremacists.
[00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:54.736]  Several of the UK's most respected TV shows, movies, and works of literature have been included in a list of works that could potentially encourage far-right sympathy.
[00:26:54.776 --> 00:26:57.018]  See, anything that encourages is now going to be outlawed.
[00:26:59.181 --> 00:27:04.025]  Compiled by taxpayer-funded, government-led Prevent Counterterrorism Program.
[00:27:05.347 --> 00:27:21.361]  The Daily Mail reports the works of some of the world's greatest writers, including examples of the warning signs of potential extremism include Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Orwell, Huxley, Kipling, Edmund Burke.
[00:27:24.153 --> 00:27:29.016]  UK's counter-terrorism program says interest in great literature a sign of far-right extremism.
[00:27:29.036 --> 00:27:30.436]  You're like, well, that'll never happen.
[00:27:31.977 --> 00:27:35.199]  Roland Dahl's book's rewritten to remove language deemed offensive.
[00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:39.121]  And the Daily Mail loves it and thinks it's really good.
[00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:40.902]  Can't use the word ugly and beastly.
[00:27:42.483 --> 00:27:44.303]  Can't say ugly, can't say fat.
[00:27:44.323 --> 00:27:46.323]  The Opa Lumpas are trans.
[00:27:46.323 --> 00:27:53.323]  It goes on from there.
[00:27:53.903 --> 00:27:54.984]  Absurd censorship!
[00:27:55.084 --> 00:28:00.890]  UK publisher slammed, frankly, countless changes to Roald Dahl's books.
[00:28:02.992 --> 00:28:04.094]  And it goes on from there.
[00:28:07.357 --> 00:28:08.658]  You gotta read these changes.
[00:28:09.639 --> 00:28:11.121]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:12.762 --> 00:28:15.645]  Talk about turning over in your grave.
[00:28:16.872 --> 00:28:21.874]  Augustus Gloop from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory can't be fat, but gender-neutral.
[00:28:22.014 --> 00:28:23.554]  Oompa Loompas aren't small.
[00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:24.895]  Small's bad, too.
[00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:27.276]  And even the BFG's gone, PC.
[00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:32.278]  Woke publishing censors rewrite his classic books for new editions that remove all language.
[00:28:33.098 --> 00:28:34.799]  Slow flicks might find offensive.
[00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:36.219]  But it's not for the snowflakes.
[00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:37.560]  They're just the minions that go along with it.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.980]  It's the establishment.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.561]  It's the intelligence agencies.
[00:28:41.961 --> 00:28:44.182]  All of them being rewritten.
[00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:46.460]  And it's just the beginning.
[00:28:47.801 --> 00:28:53.044]  Beyond Fahrenheit 451, you don't burn books, you just rewrite them.
[00:28:54.885 --> 00:29:01.729]  But of course, books themselves were outlawed in that dystopic projection of Ray Bradbury.
[00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:05.892]  Here's a report on Infowars.com.
[00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:10.755]  Study finds people with higher cognitive ability care more about free speech than political correctness.
[00:29:11.695 --> 00:29:14.137]  We don't just care about it, we know political correctness is a cancer.
[00:29:16.553 --> 00:29:34.209]  Meanwhile, we're spending too much time on Don Lemon being backbenched, maybe even removed for saying that the Republican female that's announced she's running is past her prime.
[00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.234]  See how this can be used against everybody?
[00:29:42.076 --> 00:29:42.677]  Nikki Haley.
[00:29:44.813 --> 00:29:46.760]  So that's just the beginning of all of this.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:57.208]   They want to control every facet of your life and they want everything that makes us strong, everything that makes us secure, everything that works to be destroyed.
[00:29:57.889 --> 00:30:09.035]  You can't go to CNN or the Washington Post any day without finding an article saying how wonderful it is for you and your wife to decide to start having other relationships even though 95% of the time it breaks up the marriage.
[00:30:09.376 --> 00:30:12.437]  They're saying, especially if you have kids, go out and have an affair.
[00:30:13.138 --> 00:30:14.659]  Boy, they're really your friends, aren't they?
[00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:19.682]  Can a monogamous couple happily become non-monogamous?
[00:30:22.065 --> 00:30:30.653]  School district enlists Black Lives Matter force, it's called a force, to march the white kids out into the parking lot and teach them that they're bad.
[00:30:31.193 --> 00:30:33.576]  That's gang psychology, folks, driving them into submission.
[00:30:34.597 --> 00:30:39.721]  Parents outraged at children told they must wear pride shirts to play at league halftime game.
[00:30:41.303 --> 00:30:47.529]  Woke AZ teacher slams anti-porn bill, it's actually an anti-child porn bill, which shows kids having sex with kids and adults.
[00:30:49.042 --> 00:30:51.685]  Says parents not qualified to decide what their children learn.
[00:30:51.725 --> 00:30:53.226]  There's video of her saying that.
[00:30:54.647 --> 00:30:58.071]  Trans female offended when asked if she has a penis after she brought it up.
[00:30:58.571 --> 00:30:59.272]  That's horrible.
[00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:04.056]  They're completely fine with talking to your children about their genitals, but you can't ask them.
[00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:09.862]  These are the people that have gone under the globalist mind control.
[00:31:09.902 --> 00:31:10.602]  This is the cult.
[00:31:12.344 --> 00:31:13.025]  Look at these people.
[00:31:14.628 --> 00:31:19.472]  It's a coincidence that this trans woman with trans partner has not one but two transgender kids.
[00:31:19.893 --> 00:31:20.613]  Of course not!
[00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:26.459]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:31:31.123 --> 00:31:36.083]   Man goes into female locker room and sues woman who asked him to leave for being transphobic.
[00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:44.163]  Absolute target of our children by this cult.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.484]  Two men arrested in Florida for human trafficking, a youth pastor and a foster parent tied in to the illegal aliens being brought in.
[00:31:51.985 --> 00:31:59.210]  Loudoun County School Board refuses to release internal report detailing the district's mishandling of sexual assaults by transsexual students in the bathrooms.
[00:32:00.515 --> 00:32:10.187]  Illinois Governor, the trans cult leader, lashes out at Chicago police for hosting Governor DeSantis at a police event and admits he supports comic book porn in classrooms.
[00:32:10.567 --> 00:32:12.049]  It's not porn, it's child porn.
[00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:19.778]  Three small details in the photo of first Taliban trained pilots could be damning for Biden.
[00:32:19.818 --> 00:32:20.539]  Wait till we get to that.
[00:32:21.874 --> 00:32:22.274]  Look at this.
[00:32:22.314 --> 00:32:32.657]  According to the 17-count indictment, the adoptive dads who are LGBT activists allegedly performed oral sex on both boys, forced the children to perform oral sex on them, and anally raped their sons.
[00:32:32.697 --> 00:32:38.539]  They were trying to sell them as sex slaves and shooting child porn with them.
[00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:42.781]  Now notice when this was reposted on Twitter, the left was all in there saying it isn't real.
[00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:43.901]  Really not real?
[00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:44.521]  Daily Mail.
[00:32:44.941 --> 00:32:50.103]  Gay Atlantic couple charged with raping adopted sons who then pimped them out to other local pedophiles.
[00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.211]  Gay couple accused of raping multiple adopted children will face trial.
[00:32:58.231 --> 00:33:05.293]  Atlanta father charged with raping sons was accused of another sex crime seven years ago with a child.
[00:33:06.993 --> 00:33:10.694]  Georgia couple charged with using their adopted children to make porn.
[00:33:10.714 --> 00:33:15.535]  Metro Atlanta couple charged with using adopted kids to make child porn.
[00:33:16.035 --> 00:33:18.576]  And this is something the left is defending.
[00:33:19.969 --> 00:33:20.769]  And agreeing with.
[00:33:21.329 --> 00:33:22.550]  Let me give the toll-free number out.
[00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:27.771]  We'll start taking your calls next segment.
[00:33:27.791 --> 00:33:29.952]  877-789-2539.
[00:33:29.972 --> 00:33:30.892]  877-789-Alex.
[00:33:30.912 --> 00:33:31.852]  877-789-2539.
[00:33:33.252 --> 00:33:34.653]  Let's do first-time callers, please.
[00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.373]  Give first-time callers a chance.
[00:33:36.833 --> 00:33:40.694]  And we're talking about January 6th information coming out.
[00:33:40.734 --> 00:33:41.915]  Tucker Carlson getting the footage.
[00:33:42.075 --> 00:33:42.695]  Hallelujah.
[00:33:43.255 --> 00:33:44.375]  You know the deep state's scared.
[00:33:45.115 --> 00:33:47.156]  Biden in Ukraine, the whole World War III.
[00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:59.634]  Situation, those are two giant topic areas that I would ask you to call in on those specifically.
[00:33:59.654 --> 00:34:00.914]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:00.934 --> 00:34:03.595]  We don't censor your calls.
[00:34:03.635 --> 00:34:05.096]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:34:05.136 --> 00:34:08.017]  All we ask is you have a clean phone line and be ready to talk.
[00:34:08.717 --> 00:34:12.398]  This and so much more coming up today.
[00:34:15.034 --> 00:34:18.956]  And when we come back, we'll look at your brain on drugs in 87 versus 2003.
[00:34:18.996 --> 00:34:20.177]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:21.538 --> 00:34:27.562]  We're talking about the modern book-burning going on all around us and just how totalitarian the big corporations are that control the left.
[00:34:29.543 --> 00:34:34.966]  Now the nightmares are only going to get worse until we put our foot down and say no and recognize how truly tyrannical this is.
[00:34:34.986 --> 00:34:48.809]   We're talking about The slow, now accelerating slide into World War III and Biden visiting Ukraine and the Defense Minister calling for an invasion of Russia that would lead to a certain nuclear war.
[00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:52.412]  We're talking about the January 6th tapes being turned over to Tucker Carlson.
[00:34:52.432 --> 00:34:52.472]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:52.492 --> 00:34:53.593]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:54.713]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:54.533 --> 00:35:03.812]   I want to, before I get to your calls, thank the listeners and viewers for their incredible
[00:35:03.812 --> 00:35:05.573]  support.
[00:35:05.573 --> 00:35:07.693]  The good news is we are not in the red right now.
[00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:10.022]  The bad news is we're barely in the black treading water.
[00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:11.703]  I'd like to expand.
[00:35:11.723 --> 00:35:13.303]  I'd like to be able to go cover live events.
[00:35:13.363 --> 00:35:18.326]  I'd like to be able to spend more time on news and information instead of funding.
[00:35:18.866 --> 00:35:19.726]  So I'm not complaining.
[00:35:19.766 --> 00:35:20.567]  I'm very thankful.
[00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:25.249]  But we're right there hovering on the edge of the red.
[00:35:26.129 --> 00:35:27.570]  Plus we have great products you need.
[00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:35.093]  So just commit to go get great products you need that will empower and enrich your life and those around you's lives if they take it.

[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.482]  Also, you've heard the rave reviews of the CBD oil we got from a top company that lets us private label it, that sells it in clinics and stores for $160.
[00:36:31.662 --> 00:36:35.003]  Retail, for about $110.
[00:36:35.283 --> 00:36:38.744]  Discounted, we're selling it for $60-something.
[00:36:38.944 --> 00:36:44.146]  Nobody has got this quality of CBD oil in 1000mg, 25mg and 10mg.

[00:36:57.122 --> 00:36:58.084]  Also Nitric Boost.
[00:36:58.745 --> 00:36:59.906]  Dr. Mikovits looked at it.
[00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:04.332]  So this is the best formula she'd seen for known compounds to clean out your blood and to naturally thin it.
[00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:06.890]  Okay, I told you about this latest meme.
[00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.251]  I think it says it all.
[00:37:08.331 --> 00:37:10.812]  It's an image of the egg in the frying pan from the 1980s anti-drug ad.
[00:37:10.852 --> 00:37:13.354]  This is your brain on drugs.
[00:37:13.374 --> 00:37:15.735]  Again, I'm narrating for radio listeners.
[00:37:15.555 --> 00:37:18.994]  Okay, I told you about this latest meme.
[00:37:18.994 --> 00:37:20.434]  I think it says it all.
[00:37:20.434 --> 00:37:24.875]   It's an image of the egg in the frying pan from the 1980s anti-drug ad.
[00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:26.795]  This is your brain on drugs.
[00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:30.355]  Yeah, I'm narrating for radio listeners.
[00:37:30.355 --> 00:37:35.675]  In 1987, this is your brain on drugs.
[00:37:35.675 --> 00:37:37.274]  A frying pan with an egg in it.
[00:37:37.075 --> 00:37:37.436]  Frying.
[00:37:38.396 --> 00:37:41.177]  In 2023, you can't afford the egg.
[00:37:41.217 --> 00:37:42.637]  The gas stove is being outlawed.
[00:37:42.657 --> 00:37:45.038]  The only thing you can get is the drugs.
[00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:49.459]  Bingo, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:50.800]  Bingo.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.161]  Alright, without further ado, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:59.222]  Let's go to Matt in New Jersey on the war buildup and the Biden visit to Ukraine.
[00:37:59.642 --> 00:38:00.282]  Welcome, sir.
[00:38:01.743 --> 00:38:02.243]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:03.915 --> 00:38:12.185]  I think it's disgusting that he goes over to Ukraine and gives them probably a bunch more money, or he got a check, I don't know, either way.
[00:38:12.726 --> 00:38:16.190]  I mean, how much longer are we going to poke Russia before they strike back at us?
[00:38:16.971 --> 00:38:20.696]  How much more money and ammo are we going to give so we don't have anything left?
[00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:23.400]  Well, that's the name of the globalist game.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:29.246]  Turn off our pipelines, blow up the pipeline into Germany, grab us all into total debt, send $200 billion.
[00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.507]  It's almost $200 billion.
[00:38:30.527 --> 00:38:33.630]  I think it's like $192 billion as of last week.
[00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.330]  $192 billion.
[00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:39.835]  Another $100 billion has been sent by other countries, so that's $290 billion.
[00:38:40.156 --> 00:38:43.479]  And a lot of it's been laundered back out of the country.
[00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:44.520]  It's just incredible.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.803]  What do you make of the new Ukrainian defense minister?
[00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:52.448]  Saying that they want to invade Russia and take over Moscow?
[00:38:53.749 --> 00:38:55.190]  It's the start of World War III.
[00:38:56.811 --> 00:39:02.814]  I mean, Russia's got the long-range missiles, too, and they're going to attack Ukraine from all ends, I can say it.
[00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:05.076]  And this is going to escalate into World War III.
[00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:05.596]  It's horrible.
[00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:06.277]  It is, brother.
[00:39:06.337 --> 00:39:07.157]  I appreciate your call.
[00:39:07.197 --> 00:39:07.737]  How do we stop?
[00:39:07.797 --> 00:39:08.378]  It's the question.
[00:39:08.738 --> 00:39:13.581]  Franklin in Virginia, go ahead.
[00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:14.962]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[00:39:15.501 --> 00:39:16.622]  I'm a first-time caller.
[00:39:17.403 --> 00:39:25.751]  I'm just calling to hear your thoughts on how do you think China's positioning themselves with the Ukraine-Russia conflict.
[00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:28.233]  The Chinese diplomat came to Moscow.
[00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:34.261]  Today, though, how do you think China is going to position themselves?
[00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:37.882]  Well, we know China's giving them weapons, though they've denied it.
[00:39:37.902 --> 00:39:39.063]  They're giving them raw material.
[00:39:39.863 --> 00:39:41.284]  Iran's sending them a lot of weapons.
[00:39:41.344 --> 00:39:45.165]  Israel's now been attacking with drones inside Iran.
[00:39:45.185 --> 00:39:46.586]  So this is how world wars start.
[00:39:47.006 --> 00:39:53.928]  You have different alliances that start clashing, things escalate, and then you wake up and you're in a giant world war, this time with nuclear weapons.
[00:39:53.968 --> 00:39:55.289]  So that's where I see it going, my friend.
[00:39:56.283 --> 00:40:01.027]  But historically, Russia and China haven't been really allies, especially during the Cold War.
[00:40:02.548 --> 00:40:03.049]  Well, that's right.
[00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:06.572]  They were competing forces in their communist evil.
[00:40:07.253 --> 00:40:12.877]  China wanted to control Southeast Asia with its brand of communism and other areas, and Russia was a competitor in the region.
[00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:21.225]  But this has only driven the two powerful blocs together, which is why, even from a geopolitical view, it's not a good idea.
[00:40:21.365 --> 00:40:36.372]   But our ruling class I do think that China and Russia are definitely going to form some sort of alliance, especially economically.
[00:40:37.033 --> 00:40:41.815]  But, you know, it's not good because, you know, we're kind of stretching our resources here.
[00:40:41.855 --> 00:40:44.377]  I don't think we can fight a two-front war like how we did in the 40s.
[00:40:45.979 --> 00:40:46.720]  I totally agree with you.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.424]  And also, India historically has not been big buddies with China, but now they are.
[00:40:51.804 --> 00:40:55.148]  So they've been driven closer to China and Russia, who they have been historical friends with.
[00:40:55.508 --> 00:40:56.569]  Thank you so much, Franklin.
[00:40:56.969 --> 00:40:59.872]  Pro or fro in Seattle.
[00:40:59.912 --> 00:41:00.412]  You're on the air.
[00:41:00.453 --> 00:41:00.813]  Go ahead.
[00:41:02.114 --> 00:41:03.055]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[00:41:03.095 --> 00:41:11.663]  Yeah, I was just figuring it out that, you know, they said they're going to do a book banning and the words in the book, this is all leading up to banning the Bible.
[00:41:12.606 --> 00:41:17.987]  They want to get rid of everything else so then they can say, see the Bible is the evil thing and what it has to say.
[00:41:19.127 --> 00:41:19.488]  That's right.
[00:41:19.508 --> 00:41:24.509]  They set the precedent with all these other books and then they say, see now we've got to ban the Bible.
[00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:26.909]  I totally agree with you.
[00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:34.631]  Canada and Germany and places already arrest preachers that read verses out of the Bible that they say are quote homophobic.
[00:41:36.235 --> 00:41:41.457]  Yeah, and I listen to people like Boxing Body, who's not even in our nation anymore.
[00:41:41.877 --> 00:41:46.799]  He's in the African country, but he reads the Bible by the word of the Bible, not by his interpretation.
[00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:50.481]  They want to interpret the Bible, not the true word of Christ.
[00:41:51.081 --> 00:41:54.062]  And they have to do this in order to bring on the world order.
[00:41:54.362 --> 00:41:58.084]  Well, I'm glad you raised the Bible, because I thought of that this morning when I was going to cover this before I went on air.
[00:41:58.664 --> 00:42:00.845]  They've already written thousands of different versions of it.
[00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:10.186]   The left's already tried to flood the zone with twisted Interpretations and twisted versions of the Bible.
[00:42:10.567 --> 00:42:11.788]  So this is really nothing new.
[00:42:11.808 --> 00:42:14.410]  Yeah, it's all perversions.
[00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:18.354]  It's perversions, deception of princes and principalities.
[00:42:18.594 --> 00:42:21.596]  The question I have is, when will the saints rise?
[00:42:21.797 --> 00:42:24.059]  When will we say enough's enough and take it back?
[00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:30.805]  We're trying to do it peacefully, but we will not be led to slaughter to the lions, you know, to the guillotines.
[00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.086]  We will fight back.
[00:42:32.686 --> 00:42:33.186]  I agree with you.
[00:42:33.226 --> 00:42:33.907]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:38.389]  I mean, what happened is the Rockefellers and others started the ecumenical movement about 130 years ago.
[00:42:39.289 --> 00:42:44.432]  And so they've infiltrated the seminaries and taken over most of the churches, Protestant, Catholic, you name it.
[00:42:44.532 --> 00:42:52.776]  And then those that stay traditional that are Protestant or Catholic are now being listed as the number one terror threat by the FBI in this country and similarly in Europe.
[00:42:52.816 --> 00:42:54.137]  I mean, these are the bad guys, folks.
[00:42:54.657 --> 00:42:57.899]  British intelligence is coming out and saying William Shakespeare is bad.
[00:42:58.759 --> 00:42:59.820]  These are the bad guys.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.721]  They're saying Orwell books are bad.
[00:43:02.659 --> 00:43:03.760]  Because it exposes them.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.981]  They're the bad guys, folks.
[00:43:07.121 --> 00:43:08.102]  Rich in Tennessee.
[00:43:08.162 --> 00:43:08.782]  Rich, you're on the air.
[00:43:10.843 --> 00:43:11.884]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:43:11.944 --> 00:43:12.965]  It's an honor.
[00:43:13.005 --> 00:43:13.985]  We go way back.
[00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:17.007]  I even remember you as a host on Coach.
[00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:21.049]  But at any rate, I just want to say that this is probably a good thing.
[00:43:21.089 --> 00:43:24.291]  These people are overplaying their hands in everything they attack.
[00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:26.692]  They're going to hit on a certain group.
[00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:42.465]  And, you know, when all this shakes out, I mean, I think they're probably going to hit us with biological weapons and a war and destroying the economy, but when all this shakes out, none of these people that want to be at the top are going to be at the top, and we're going to start over as sovereign states again.
[00:43:42.905 --> 00:43:43.325]  I agree.
[00:43:43.345 --> 00:43:46.286]  The minions of the New World Order have been set up by Satan.
[00:43:47.787 --> 00:43:48.607]  Right, right.
[00:43:49.605 --> 00:43:50.045]  No doubt.
[00:43:50.105 --> 00:43:52.886]  There's a lot of dark, evil things going on right now.
[00:43:53.086 --> 00:44:00.489]  Can you believe how the mask is off and how they're just right out in the open pushing total censorship, pedophilia, open borders, the end of the family?
[00:44:00.509 --> 00:44:06.011]  I mean, why would anybody sign on to these people when you can see as soon as they get control, everything falls apart?
[00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:07.791]  Why do their minions follow it?
[00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.012]  Because it's a spiritual thing.
[00:44:10.592 --> 00:44:13.533]  I can believe it because they've got nothing to hide now.
[00:44:13.553 --> 00:44:15.354]  This is the last card they have to play.
[00:44:15.374 --> 00:44:18.515]  That's another indication we're at the endgame here.
[00:44:19.537 --> 00:44:20.778]  They can't hide it anymore.
[00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:21.258]  I agree.
[00:44:21.278 --> 00:44:24.900]  In the time we have left, Rich, do you think this Russia war is going to peter out?
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.061]  Biden says it's going to go on forever, basically.
[00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:28.222]  It looks like it's only going to get worse.
[00:44:29.302 --> 00:44:31.344]  No, I think it's going to escalate.
[00:44:31.364 --> 00:44:32.424]  That's where we're headed.
[00:44:32.584 --> 00:44:39.668]  And it wouldn't surprise me if Russia finally got sick of being the beat-up boy all the time.
[00:44:39.788 --> 00:44:44.851]  And, you know, maybe they'd even shoot a nuke at Washington.
[00:44:44.871 --> 00:44:45.051]  I agree.
[00:44:45.171 --> 00:44:45.451]  I agree.
[00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:48.311]  Hour number two with Stu Peters, Jim Hopton, more coming up.
[00:44:48.311 --> 00:45:04.311]  The cavalry has arrived.

[00:46:04.602 --> 00:46:08.685]  The breaking news, stay at home, that is the order tonight from four state governors.
[00:46:08.865 --> 00:46:12.308]  You absolutely must stay at home.
[00:46:12.488 --> 00:46:14.049]  You must stay at home.
[00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:17.372]  All gatherings are cancelled until further notice.
[00:46:17.572 --> 00:46:22.436]  I have issued an executive order, it's not a suggestion, it's an order.
[00:46:22.656 --> 00:46:29.461]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you, and we will take you to jail.
[00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:34.005]  This means no weddings, in-person services, or even parties.
[00:46:35.606 --> 00:46:39.688]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[00:46:39.968 --> 00:46:45.211]  I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[00:46:45.391 --> 00:46:47.672]  Quarantine will be mandatory.
[00:46:48.012 --> 00:46:50.233]  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[00:46:50.793 --> 00:46:56.737]  Those few bad actors will be identified and the Tampa Police Department will handle it.
[00:46:56.897 --> 00:47:00.398]  We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[00:47:04.942 --> 00:47:12.745]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:47:13.365 --> 00:47:16.826]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:47:18.227 --> 00:47:21.008]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:47:21.028 --> 00:47:24.369]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:47:24.429 --> 00:47:27.410]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:30.391]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:47:32.751 --> 00:47:43.360]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:56.071]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:47:58.453 --> 00:48:00.295]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:48:02.316 --> 00:48:04.623]  You're not gonna be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:48:04.643 --> 00:48:07.772]  You're not gonna be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:48:07.792 --> 00:48:09.056]  It's scary.
[00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:18.413]  One thing the NFL really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible just to keep everybody safe.
[00:48:18.453 --> 00:48:24.717]  And that starts with a vast majority of teams deciding already that there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games.
[00:48:25.137 --> 00:48:34.862]  And every single player in the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them keep their distance off the field and for contact tracing should it become necessary.
[00:48:35.262 --> 00:48:37.064]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:48:37.824 --> 00:48:40.647]  Players are not excited about this kind of idea.
[00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:41.308]  No fans.
[00:48:41.948 --> 00:48:43.670]  Yes, but they may have to get used to it.
[00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:47.974]  But all around the country, there will be empty stadiums and masks on the sidelines.
[00:48:48.194 --> 00:48:49.956]  No fans will be allowed in.
[00:48:50.136 --> 00:48:55.601]  I can't imagine Howie playing in the NFL this day and time with no fans there.
[00:48:55.621 --> 00:48:57.903]  I honestly can't even conceive that.
[00:48:58.123 --> 00:49:00.444]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:49:00.464 --> 00:49:03.605]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:49:03.625 --> 00:49:04.966]  Don't get the vaccine?
[00:49:05.646 --> 00:49:07.047]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[00:49:07.347 --> 00:49:08.027]  Don't have the vaccine?
[00:49:08.047 --> 00:49:08.527]  You don't show it?
[00:49:08.667 --> 00:49:09.528]  Can't go to the ballgame.
[00:49:10.008 --> 00:49:10.888]  Don't have the vaccine?
[00:49:11.488 --> 00:49:12.149]  Can't go to work.
[00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:20.152]  Because everybody in the establishment will still kind of halfway listen now and go, well he's been right about everything else, maybe we should look into this.
[00:49:20.732 --> 00:49:22.633]  Look, you'll believe it if they release it.
[00:49:22.873 --> 00:49:24.754]  So just remember this transmission then.
[00:49:26.935 --> 00:49:33.363]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:39.310]  She died after suffering blood clots just over a week after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.975]  Her 58-year-old mother died less than an hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:49:44.216 --> 00:49:45.617]  My little sister just died.
[00:49:46.892 --> 00:49:47.832]  Her first dose.
[00:49:48.192 --> 00:49:53.994]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:49:54.274 --> 00:49:57.914]  His dad died four days after getting his second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[00:49:58.294 --> 00:50:01.515]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[00:50:01.995 --> 00:50:06.116]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[00:50:07.256 --> 00:50:11.417]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[00:50:12.678 --> 00:50:14.438]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:19.152]  Don't resist when they release the bioweapon.
[00:50:19.392 --> 00:50:22.055]  Submit and die with pleasure!
[00:50:26.158 --> 00:50:26.879]  InfoWars.
[00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:28.140]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   today ah
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:06.179]   Most of human history has been competing systems of tyranny fighting with each other
[00:51:06.179 --> 00:51:16.179]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:51:07.512 --> 00:51:15.340]  But only in the Renaissance age, the last 550 years, have we seen a move to try to empower humanity and lift up the masses, and it did it.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:25.830]  But the globalists have made the conscious decision to reverse all that, destroy culture, art, literature, the family, prosperity, and create a nightmare system for 99.99% of the public.
[00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:27.592]  Why would anyone support what they do?
[00:51:31.943 --> 00:51:38.930]  But they trick people through the educational system and through the culture to think they're winners if they go along with the New World Order.
[00:51:39.811 --> 00:51:42.634]  Now we're already in a war with Russia.
[00:51:43.555 --> 00:51:45.036]  It's spiraling out of control.
[00:51:45.697 --> 00:51:49.441]  There's massive censorship and control, book banning going on everywhere.
[00:51:49.461 --> 00:52:04.857]   And then the left accuses populists and conservatives and nationalists and classical liberals Of book banning when we don't want pedophilic books given to elementary and middle schoolers, teaching them to have pedophilic sex with adults.
[00:52:05.757 --> 00:52:09.179]  No, that's not book banning, that's saying don't give those books to children.
[00:52:09.999 --> 00:52:14.922]  The left are the ones banning films, banning individuals, banning literature, rewriting books.
[00:52:16.103 --> 00:52:18.024]  And we covered a lot of that in the last hour.
[00:52:18.424 --> 00:52:23.327]  As British intelligence openly says, Shakespeare and George Orwell and J.R.R.
[00:52:23.427 --> 00:52:24.468]  Tolkien are bad.
[00:52:25.523 --> 00:52:32.172]  We're taking your calls on those subjects, and McCarthy has made good on his promise to release the January 6 footage.
[00:52:32.653 --> 00:52:36.419]  I would have done an open source to the world, but he's giving it to Tucker Carlson, who I do trust.
[00:52:36.799 --> 00:52:38.521]  I don't know how Tucker's going to digest all that.
[00:52:39.909 --> 00:52:41.970]  Jim Hoff joins us at the bottom of the hour to discuss it.
[00:52:42.131 --> 00:52:44.072]  We're going to go back to your phone calls here in a moment.
[00:52:44.172 --> 00:52:45.873]  Allison in the UK and others.
[00:52:46.694 --> 00:52:50.737]  But first, Jimmy Dore was at the big Peace Rally Saturday with Ron Paul and others.
[00:52:51.337 --> 00:52:52.157]  I really like Jimmy Dore.
[00:52:52.178 --> 00:52:52.838]  I want him on the show.
[00:52:53.619 --> 00:52:55.320]  But he doesn't ever come on.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.942]  We send him emails, but he says nice stuff about me everywhere.
[00:52:58.262 --> 00:53:03.187]   The guy's really funny and smart, even though he's kind of a We're approved now.
[00:53:03.207 --> 00:53:11.174]  He kind of woken up from the old days when he was spitting on me in public and things at the Young Turks at the RNC in 2016.
[00:53:11.935 --> 00:53:17.621]  But here's Jimmy Dore on Patrick Ben-David's program just yesterday, knocking it out of the park.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:25.304]  The only difference between a Democrat and a Republican, as Ralph Nader said, is the speed at which their knee hits the floor when a donor walks in the room.
[00:53:26.444 --> 00:53:28.365]  And so it doesn't matter who's president.
[00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.847]  Barack Obama was not a departure from George Bush.
[00:53:30.887 --> 00:53:32.427]  He was a continuation of George Bush.
[00:53:32.447 --> 00:53:34.188]  He took us from two wars to seven wars.
[00:53:34.528 --> 00:53:39.771]  He kicked 5.1 million families out of their homes while he made sure the bankers didn't miss their bonuses.
[00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:43.233]  He deported twice as many Hispanics as Donald Trump.
[00:53:43.713 --> 00:53:46.054]  He built those cages that put those people in.
[00:53:46.074 --> 00:53:47.835]  He dropped 26,000 bombs.
[00:53:48.315 --> 00:53:50.216]  The Air Force ran out of bombs.
[00:53:50.356 --> 00:53:50.956]  That's a fact.
[00:53:51.216 --> 00:53:51.857]  They ran out of bombs.
[00:53:51.897 --> 00:53:52.737]  He dropped so many bombs.
[00:53:52.977 --> 00:53:56.919]  He did a drone war, a drone program, that killed 90% innocent people.
[00:53:57.099 --> 00:54:02.301]  You know, if somebody walks into a mall and shoots 15 people down with this gun, that's the biggest thing.
[00:54:02.341 --> 00:54:06.703]  Oh my God, Barack Obama was doing that on a daily basis, killing women and children with his drone war.
[00:54:06.823 --> 00:54:10.503]   and he got a Nobel Peace Prize. He got a Nobel Peace Prize, he didn't even do anything.
[00:54:10.503 --> 00:54:13.783]  That's hum- and so it's a unit party.
[00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:17.422]   And so when Trump got in office and he mentioned that there's a deep state,
[00:54:17.422 --> 00:54:19.662]  they're like, "You can't say that! What are you doing?"
[00:54:19.662 --> 00:54:22.903]   And when he said, "Hey, when they asked him, 'Why are you leaving your troops in Syria?'
[00:54:22.903 --> 00:54:26.502]   and he said, 'For the oil.' They're like, 'You can't bug us!' He goes, 'No, it's for the oil.'"
[00:54:26.627 --> 00:54:27.488]  No, it's for liberty.
[00:54:27.528 --> 00:54:28.508]  It's for helping the people.
[00:54:28.528 --> 00:54:29.389]  No, it's for the oil.
[00:54:29.449 --> 00:54:30.070]  It's our oil.
[00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.792]  And so he let the cat out of the bag, and they can't have that.
[00:54:32.912 --> 00:54:35.695]  That's what he blew the whistle on what's actually going on.
[00:54:35.795 --> 00:54:36.916]  Our wars are for oil.
[00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:40.639]  Our wars are economic wars, just like what's happening in Ukraine.
[00:54:40.659 --> 00:54:41.620]  This is an economic war.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.742]  We're trying to put a hurt and isolate Russia.
[00:54:44.102 --> 00:54:51.243]  We're afraid of Russia and their natural resources and their manpower coming together with Germany with their technology and their capital.
[00:54:51.544 --> 00:54:53.564]  And we've been saying that for decades.
[00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:56.284]  And so that's why we blew up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[00:54:56.304 --> 00:54:58.245]  And that's why this Ukraine war is happening.
[00:54:58.805 --> 00:55:00.945]  And people have no idea what's happening.
[00:55:00.965 --> 00:55:04.086]  And what's worse is they have no idea that they have no idea what's happening.
[00:55:04.126 --> 00:55:05.006]  That's the crazy part.
[00:55:07.027 --> 00:55:08.167]  Very well said.
[00:55:08.347 --> 00:55:09.207]  Absolutely true.
[00:55:09.227 --> 00:55:11.067]  I want to play one more clip.
[00:55:11.087 --> 00:55:11.988]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:55:12.048 --> 00:55:18.982]   This is a woman in Brazil, where the convicted felon communist has been installed by the State Department election fraud.
[00:55:19.942 --> 00:55:28.526]  Talking about two to three years in prison and your children being taken away and all of this and they'll still forcibly inject you with the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA shots.
[00:55:28.586 --> 00:55:33.288]  That's where they want to take us and it's only one election away if they're able to get their way.
[00:55:33.328 --> 00:55:34.209]  Look what they've done in Brazil.
[00:55:34.249 --> 00:55:34.629]  Here it is.
[00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:36.710]  This is completely insane.
[00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.830]  This is a nightmare.
[00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:38.991]  Listen very well.
[00:55:39.611 --> 00:55:50.203]  The penalty is imprisonment from two to eight years plus fine if you refuse vaccination without just cause.
[00:55:50.363 --> 00:56:11.084]   The same penalty is incurred by anyone who creates, disseminates or propagates by any means Fake news regarding vaccines in the National Immunization Program, or their effectiveness, which in any way dissuades vaccination.
[00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:14.587]  Right now, I'm sure that my life is in danger.
[00:56:16.028 --> 00:56:17.109]  I have no doubt about it.
[00:56:18.513 --> 00:56:21.275]  Now that's always been the plan through the U.N.
[00:56:21.315 --> 00:56:22.416]  announcements and now the U.N.
[00:56:22.456 --> 00:56:37.125]  treaty to arrest those that don't take shots and put them in jail and then give you a special high-powered mRNA shot, which they arrested thousands that protested the election fraud and gave them shots that reportedly were even far deadlier than the normal ones.
[00:56:37.505 --> 00:56:41.108]  This is all just the cover for execution.
[00:56:41.688 --> 00:56:44.490]  This is how they come in a biomedical tyranny.
[00:56:45.708 --> 00:56:48.370]  They're not starting World War III, they're coming after our bodily autonomy.
[00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.412]  Alison in the United Kingdom, thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[00:56:52.653 --> 00:56:53.433]  Yes, hi.
[00:56:53.914 --> 00:56:54.214]  Welcome.
[00:56:55.315 --> 00:56:55.975]  Hi, thank you.
[00:56:55.995 --> 00:57:20.784]   The question was raised by you earlier about how to stop World War III, and I wanted to say I think there should be a neutral territory between, you know, Poland and Between Russia and Poland, where it's just no government should be exercised.
[00:57:22.244 --> 00:57:34.931]  It should be equal parts according to the ratio of space to people from each country, so that there's no tiff about who should fight over what area.
[00:57:36.392 --> 00:57:38.153]  You know what I mean, I think.
[00:57:40.755 --> 00:57:41.075]  Hello?
[00:57:41.296 --> 00:57:41.656]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:57:44.838 --> 00:57:46.479]  And good products, too, by the way.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.421]  And I got your great reset book as well.
[00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:50.923]  I haven't read it yet, but it's a signed copy.
[00:57:51.623 --> 00:57:52.664]  Well, thank you for the support.
[00:57:52.704 --> 00:57:56.007]  It's people like you, Allison, that keep the broadcast on the air.
[00:57:56.227 --> 00:58:00.390]  And look, my big issue is, why aren't there bigger protests?
[00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:05.073]  Why aren't more people upset about something that is quickly, again, escalating into nuclear war?
[00:58:05.514 --> 00:58:06.494]  That's my issue.
[00:58:07.475 --> 00:58:09.737]  Yeah, prayer and fasting, too, of course.
[00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:11.603]  To stop a war like this.
[00:58:12.443 --> 00:58:14.725]  Well, you sound like you're an American or a Canadian.
[00:58:14.965 --> 00:58:16.146]  How long have you lived in the UK?
[00:58:17.807 --> 00:58:18.247]  Not long.
[00:58:18.287 --> 00:58:20.088]  I moved here because I married someone.
[00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:23.030]  How are you liking it?
[00:58:24.031 --> 00:58:27.053]  Well, it's a big adjustment, trust me.
[00:58:28.334 --> 00:58:30.215]  But the people here are very nice.
[00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:35.563]  They're too nice, and that's why the globalists are conquering the UK and Canada and everywhere else.
[00:58:35.903 --> 00:58:38.964]  It's time to stop being so nice to what the New World Order's doing.
[00:58:38.984 --> 00:58:40.185]  But no, I absolutely hear you.
[00:58:40.205 --> 00:58:41.446]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:41.506 --> 00:58:41.946]  Thank you.
[00:58:42.626 --> 00:58:45.087]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller.
[00:58:45.888 --> 00:58:56.392]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Hmm... Let's talk to Linda in Oklahoma.
[00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:59.274]  Linda, you're on the air on China and the fentanyl crisis.
[00:58:59.294 --> 00:58:59.594]  Go ahead.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.840]  Thank you for having me.
[00:59:02.441 --> 00:59:10.764]  I just want to call and ask people that claim to be Christian, please pray for the church.
[00:59:11.444 --> 00:59:12.945]  They have failed us.
[00:59:13.645 --> 00:59:18.207]  They are falling right in line with all of this propaganda.
[00:59:18.527 --> 00:59:26.170]  I just lost my grandson to fentanyl, and he's 33 years old with a four-year-old.
[00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.770]  Oh my goodness.
[00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.051]  And it should have never happened.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:35.003]  And we had a woman there that used to be an awesome, awesome pastor in that town.
[00:59:35.924 --> 00:59:47.172]  She got up and started talking about loving Mother Earth and how we can talk to the dead and we can raise the dead and they can walk with us, we just don't see them.
[00:59:48.112 --> 01:00:04.970]   But God talked to me before I went to the funeral and I was washing my car and crying my eyes out and God said, Will you stand up and say something for me if you get asked to speak?
[01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:14.318]  And I said, yes Lord, I want everybody to know about this killer drug and I want everybody to know that we better get in prayer.
[01:00:14.538 --> 01:00:15.539]  Linda, don't hang up.
[01:00:15.639 --> 01:00:18.721]  I want you to repeat what you said at your grandson's funeral.
[01:00:19.662 --> 01:00:20.663]  When we come back.
[01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:21.483]  Don't hang up, Linda.
[01:00:21.503 --> 01:00:22.043]  Stay right there.
[01:00:22.063 --> 01:00:23.384]  I want to hear what you said there.
[01:00:23.884 --> 01:00:30.007]  And whether it's at a funeral, or whether it's a city council, or whether it's the church, or whether it's at work, we all need to start being heard.
[01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.690]  None of us have to reach a million people, but we've all got to reach 10, 20 people a day.
[01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.290]  This is an information war.
[01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:37.171]  It's a spiritual war.
[01:00:37.491 --> 01:00:38.752]  Linda, sweetheart, stay right there.
[01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.100]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:41.580]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:47.083]  Central it's the Alex Jones Show right here coming to you from InfoWars.com on stations across the country.
[01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:50.864]  Very thankful all those wonderful affiliates please support them.
[01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:55.747]  We've got some big guests coming up.
[01:00:56.946 --> 01:00:58.147]  Stu Peters hasn't been on in a while.
[01:00:58.207 --> 01:00:58.967]  He's been on fire.
[01:00:59.607 --> 01:01:01.728]  He's going to cover a ton of big issues with us in the next hour.
[01:01:02.468 --> 01:01:05.089]  We've got Jim Hoffman, Gateway Pundit, popping in.
[01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:08.411]  We'll continue with calls and we'll be hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:10.712]  Let's move through your calls as quickly as possible.
[01:01:10.732 --> 01:01:14.313]  But I want to go back to Linda in Oklahoma, who lost her grandson to fentanyl.
[01:01:15.854 --> 01:01:17.914]  And that's one of my biggest concerns.
[01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:21.839]   My children Two of them are completely grown up.
[01:01:22.199 --> 01:01:23.541]  One of them's in high school.
[01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:24.662]  Another one's five.
[01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:30.588]  But so many of these drugs out there, like even marijuana, get laced with fentanyl and kill people.
[01:01:31.268 --> 01:01:32.049]  And everybody knows about that.
[01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:33.050]  Hundreds of thousands a year.
[01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.652]  It's getting worse all the time.
[01:01:35.313 --> 01:01:37.395]  That's why young people can't experiment, folks.
[01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:41.139]  You don't want to think, oh, I'll experiment with marijuana.
[01:01:41.159 --> 01:01:42.120]  Let me experiment with something else.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.221]  Because you don't know.
[01:01:45.364 --> 01:01:48.245]  And most people getting killed don't even know that they took fentanyl.
[01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:52.327]  And so, I would just tell young people, do not take anything.
[01:01:53.727 --> 01:01:56.228]  What did you say to your church that God laid on your heart, Linda?
[01:01:58.369 --> 01:01:58.829]  I got up.
[01:01:59.069 --> 01:02:05.931]  God knew that this woman was going to be there, and we all started praying and binding and gagging that spirit.
[01:02:06.052 --> 01:02:17.430]   So when I got up there, I told them about my car wash experience, and I said, I'm here to tell you There was a bunch of drug addicts out there, and God wanted to talk to them.
[01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:25.134]  And I said, if you're doing drugs, or if you've tried it, or if you're thinking about it, I said, call on God.
[01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:26.355]  Get down on your knees.
[01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:28.216]  Go to your car right now.
[01:02:28.737 --> 01:02:29.677]  You need God.
[01:02:29.737 --> 01:02:30.958]  He can help you through this.
[01:02:31.639 --> 01:02:34.260]  And I said, Cameron went to every rehab.
[01:02:34.581 --> 01:02:40.264]  Sometimes they were $20,000 and $30,000, and we've been trying to help him for 16 years.
[01:02:41.145 --> 01:02:42.826]  And then fentanyl came along.
[01:02:43.556 --> 01:02:46.978]  And I said, you've got to try, God.
[01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:57.546]  And I was just speaking as a grandmother, and I said, you don't want to see, you don't want your grandparents to see you here.
[01:02:57.566 --> 01:03:03.430]  And God was just pleading with them, because I didn't even want to go up there if it was me.
[01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:07.713]  And I can't remember everything I said, because it was God.
[01:03:07.733 --> 01:03:10.555]  That's beautiful, and I would just say this.
[01:03:11.806 --> 01:03:23.569]  For anybody thinking about using any drugs, street drugs, you name it, it's like putting a revolver .357 mag in your head that has one bullet in it and pulling the trigger and playing Russian Roulette.
[01:03:24.169 --> 01:03:28.431]  Folks, you cannot use any street drugs, period.
[01:03:28.491 --> 01:03:29.271]  I know they're everywhere.
[01:03:30.134 --> 01:03:31.596]  You cannot do it.
[01:03:31.997 --> 01:03:33.218]  Drugs are just everywhere now.
[01:03:34.059 --> 01:03:38.425]  And I've been in hotels and bars and people, you know, the bartenders try to sell me drugs.
[01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:39.527]  I mean, are you kidding?
[01:03:39.547 --> 01:03:44.133]  I mean, A, I wouldn't be taking them anyways, but I did experiment some in high school and college.
[01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:46.456]  Never a lot because it always made me feel so bad.
[01:03:46.476 --> 01:03:46.536]  But...
[01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.465]  I don't know how anybody takes like methamphetamine or cocaine.
[01:03:50.485 --> 01:03:51.646]  I've taken both of them a few times.
[01:03:51.987 --> 01:03:54.128]  You talk about feeling like you were run over by a car the next day.
[01:03:54.909 --> 01:03:59.712]  But folks, for young people listening, don't ever use any of it.
[01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:02.894]  And don't go to parties where it's going on because they'll put it in your drink.
[01:04:03.675 --> 01:04:09.239]  Ma'am, I love you and I appreciate you and you'll hopefully see your grandson in the future.
[01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:09.799]  God bless you.
[01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.502]  Hopefully he'll be with us in heaven.
[01:04:14.463 --> 01:04:16.764]  Kelly in Chicago, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:04:16.804 --> 01:04:17.105]  Go ahead.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.720]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:24.122]  I'm pretty bummed out with World War 3 and all the fentanyl and it's just, we're under attack.
[01:04:25.102 --> 01:04:26.142]  Same, same here.
[01:04:26.422 --> 01:04:32.684]  So I'm calling because I'm very interested in what Tucker's going to find, what he's going to release.
[01:04:33.304 --> 01:04:36.325]  I was at January 6th, I was at St.
[01:04:36.345 --> 01:04:36.645]  D.C.
[01:04:37.385 --> 01:04:42.367]  November, December, hung out with some of your crew outside the Marriott, some of those trips.
[01:04:44.477 --> 01:04:51.760]  We, when we went there, my sister-in-law and some other girls that we were friends with, we went, we went there and we were, you know, walking up to the Capitol.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:01.084]  We were making our way up there and now I know who it is, but Kevin Greeson's body was brought down right next to us.
[01:05:02.684 --> 01:05:04.285]  Um, you there?
[01:05:04.725 --> 01:05:05.325]  I'm listening.
[01:05:05.926 --> 01:05:06.166]  Yes.
[01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.166]  Yeah.
[01:05:07.466 --> 01:05:07.626]  Yeah.
[01:05:08.106 --> 01:05:14.717]   So I, I looked and looked and tried to find for, For months and months, who that was.
[01:05:15.897 --> 01:05:22.102]  You knew the person was, at that point, you know, we could see clearly he was either deceased at the time or close to it.
[01:05:22.902 --> 01:05:25.404]  I couldn't find anything on him.
[01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:41.115]  It wasn't until about six months ago, I'm not sure if it was one of the Epoch Times releases or one of the other ones that finally came out about six months ago, where we were able to actually even learn that this person existed.
[01:05:42.085 --> 01:05:44.486]  Other than what we saw with our own two eyes.
[01:05:45.827 --> 01:05:53.310]  And I can tell you the spirit of myself who went there and so many others that I spoke with that trip.
[01:05:53.690 --> 01:06:00.793]  You know, we went with a group of strangers that we met on the previous trip and we were there, you know, to support our president.
[01:06:00.813 --> 01:06:04.614]  There was no ill will, no bad intentions.
[01:06:05.735 --> 01:06:10.777]  When we walked up the Capitol, what we saw was something I had never experienced in any other trip to D.C.
[01:06:11.918 --> 01:06:14.682]  I looked at my sister-in-law and I said, those are not our people.
[01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:16.846]  Those cannot be our people.
[01:06:17.346 --> 01:06:22.313]  People climbing on statues and gas masks with weapons.
[01:06:23.135 --> 01:06:28.142]  I was not typical of the Trump supporters and the America First group.
[01:06:28.815 --> 01:06:31.656]  So I'm very interested to see what he uncovers.
[01:06:31.676 --> 01:06:35.178]  There's tons of footage of patrons trying to stop the people breaking in.
[01:06:35.678 --> 01:06:38.799]  They tricked a few people to join them, but overall it was feds and it's all coming out.
[01:06:38.819 --> 01:06:44.862]  I can tell you, I know it's come out in the court and it's been secret, and it was being run by the CIA and the FBI.
[01:06:44.882 --> 01:06:46.722]  They had sex operatives, they had everything.
[01:06:47.142 --> 01:06:48.823]  They had a battle plan to attack the Capitol.
[01:06:48.843 --> 01:06:50.024]  They were trying to shop around.
[01:06:50.564 --> 01:06:52.545]  They were trying to set us all up, including myself.
[01:06:53.065 --> 01:06:55.046]  But I'm just glad, Kelly, that it's all going to be coming out.
[01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:56.986]  God bless Tucker Carlson and everybody else.
[01:06:57.026 --> 01:06:57.927]  Thank you so much, Kelly.
[01:06:58.783 --> 01:07:00.884]  All right, let's go to Wendy in Alaska.
[01:07:00.904 --> 01:07:02.064]  Go ahead, Wendy, you're on the air.
[01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.085]  Well, good morning, Alex.
[01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:04.946]  How are you today?
[01:07:04.966 --> 01:07:09.928]  I mean, I just love my family and love everybody else, and I can't believe we're already entering World War III.
[01:07:09.988 --> 01:07:10.628]  I'm pretty upset.
[01:07:11.689 --> 01:07:18.391]  Yeah, well, I just want to say thank you to InfoWars, the whole staff, and especially to you for all that you have sacrificed, as well as your family.
[01:07:19.392 --> 01:07:23.574]  We're pretty heavy duty in Alaska, as far as Alex supporters.
[01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:27.673]  And I just wanted to let you know that we love your products.
[01:07:27.713 --> 01:07:34.919]  The Winter Sun, the X-T Spray, the Super Blue toothpaste were the gift to all the teenagers for Christmas this year to get them off the junk.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:41.185]  But I'm calling about a book that we're dealing with in the state of Alaska right now.
[01:07:41.285 --> 01:07:45.068]  The educational system is trying to incorporate.
[01:07:45.088 --> 01:07:46.670]  It's called Let's Talk About It.
[01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:48.772]  And it's by Erica Moen.
[01:07:48.872 --> 01:08:04.116]   And it's a book basically that relates to Adult sex with children, teaching kids how to get on to porn on the internet, how to do some pretty aggressive and very unnatural things, and to accept it and to be glad for it.
[01:08:04.136 --> 01:08:09.982]  Oh, the head censor at Twitter, remember, defended children getting on homosexual hookup sites.
[01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:10.182]  Yeah.
[01:08:10.202 --> 01:08:13.426]  I mean, they are literally trying to tell children to have sex with adults.
[01:08:14.318 --> 01:08:15.659]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:20.623]  We went to the school board and actually the school board shut down one of the lead speakers because they didn't want to hear about it.
[01:08:20.823 --> 01:08:22.605]  Basically told him to just walk out the door.
[01:08:23.385 --> 01:08:35.875]  So, my other topic basically is, you know, up in Alaska we have a little bit of information along the Aleutian Chain and I think, you know, we look at the borders with that crazy Newsom in California, you got that Hobbs in Arizona.
[01:08:36.556 --> 01:08:39.339]  And up here with Trudeau, you know, we're basically wide open.
[01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:45.264]  They've created a perfect triad for World War III, and we're all sitting ducks off the Aleutian chain.
[01:08:45.304 --> 01:08:48.287]  We have had sightings of ships that are not American ships.
[01:08:49.187 --> 01:08:51.649]  And people up here are pretty concerned.
[01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:52.210]  Absolutely.
[01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:55.372]  You're on the front lines if this thing goes nuclear with Russia.
[01:08:55.713 --> 01:08:57.174]  But what you mention is big news.
[01:08:57.254 --> 01:09:01.878]  Alaska board members brawl over silencing dad exposing book on kinks and sexting.
[01:09:01.958 --> 01:09:02.799]  I'm going to interrupt you.
[01:09:03.099 --> 01:09:05.201]  So they won't let the parents read what's in the book.
[01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.102]  They just give it to your 6th and 7th graders.
[01:09:07.623 --> 01:09:08.323]  This is sick.
[01:09:08.884 --> 01:09:10.765]  These people are evil beyond belief.
[01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:11.946]  Corrupting our children.
[01:09:11.966 --> 01:09:12.487]  Thank you, Wendy.
[01:09:13.126 --> 01:09:24.170]  Alright, we've got a bunch of other calls I'll get to you all, but we've got Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit giving us a little prelude on what's going to be coming out with this big Tucker Carlson situation where he has gotten the January 6th footage.
[01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:25.991]  TheGatewayPundit.com.
[01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:26.791]  Tucker Carlson.
[01:09:27.632 --> 01:09:28.292]  Alex Jones.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:37.345]  James O'Keefe, you can really count on one hand who the real fighters are, and it's you, the viewers and listeners, that make it all possible.
[01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:39.166]  We've got some really bad news.
[01:09:39.206 --> 01:09:40.007]  We knew it was coming.
[01:09:40.047 --> 01:09:41.908]  It was a lie that James O'Keefe resigned.
[01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.610]  It was put out yesterday by the board, it looks like.
[01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:46.651]  James O'Keefe has been removed.
[01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:52.855]  He's been fired from the organization he founded and led for eating someone's sandwich.
[01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:57.899]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, eating someone's sandwich, and he yelled at someone once.
[01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:00.537]  So there you go.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.445]  And they're threatening to criminally indict people.
[01:10:03.806 --> 01:10:07.656]  The last straw was that coup when he exposed Pfizer, head of mRNA.
[01:10:09.815 --> 01:10:11.136]  Infowars doesn't have a board.
[01:10:11.376 --> 01:10:13.878]  Infowars has you, the listeners, and I'm the leader of Infowars.
[01:10:14.479 --> 01:10:16.481]  My board is the listeners and viewers of this show.
[01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:20.104]  If you decide to buy products at InfowarsStore.com, we stay on air.
[01:10:20.524 --> 01:10:22.546]  If you decide not to get the products, we go off air.
[01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:23.967]  We're barely in the black right now.
[01:10:24.367 --> 01:10:25.368]  I'd like to expand.
[01:10:25.708 --> 01:10:28.391]  I don't want to just tread water here, so please go to InfowarsStore.
[01:10:28.631 --> 01:10:30.092]  We have great products that enrich your life.
[01:10:30.332 --> 01:10:31.994]  Our ultimate bone broth is finally back in stock.
[01:10:32.054 --> 01:10:33.175]  Our prebiotics back in stock.
[01:10:33.735 --> 01:10:35.256]  They're both massively discounted, 40% off.
[01:10:35.296 --> 01:10:40.239]  We've got the best CBD oil that's so good for your body, your brain, your joints, your bones, and more.
[01:10:40.299 --> 01:10:42.060]  Highest quality at less than half the price.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.281]  It's sold in stores.
[01:10:43.381 --> 01:10:44.621]  Our nitric oxide's the best.
[01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:46.102]  All the products are great.
[01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:50.305]  InfoWarsTore.com, BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, great nootropics.
[01:10:50.325 --> 01:10:52.706]  They're both 50% off right now as well.
[01:10:53.106 --> 01:10:53.787]  Take action.
[01:10:53.827 --> 01:10:57.409]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today so we don't suffer the same fate as James O'Keefe.
[01:10:57.689 --> 01:10:59.090]  I've been talking to James some off-air.
[01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:00.570]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:11:01.651 --> 01:11:03.452]  And we'll probably get him on here very, very soon.
[01:11:03.472 --> 01:11:05.453]  But he's getting ready to make some big moves.
[01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:07.754]  But this is outrageous and disgusting.
[01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:18.647]   Now we go now to Jim Hoff, the founder of Gateway Pundit, that I can say is the most prolific Patriot populist organization in the world.
[01:11:19.107 --> 01:11:20.769]  Without them we'd be up the creek without a paddle.
[01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:25.593]  I know their deep research in January 6th has been critical to Tucker Carlson's in-depth research.
[01:11:25.973 --> 01:11:27.435]  So I want to just cover the waterfront here.
[01:11:27.635 --> 01:11:29.136]  A. James O'Keefe and Veritas.
[01:11:29.557 --> 01:11:30.558]  How serious this is.
[01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:32.920]  Your view on that as this is just now breaking.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.622]  One of our great colleagues, one of our peers here.
[01:11:36.323 --> 01:11:39.305]  I wish we had more peers, but we don't.
[01:11:39.325 --> 01:11:41.627]  A lot of great people, but nobody's reached this level.
[01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:43.168]  And that's not bragging.
[01:11:43.228 --> 01:11:44.790]  It means we're under attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:45.410]  We need your support.
[01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.031]  We're under globalist bombardment.
[01:11:47.712 --> 01:11:48.753]  Because we are the most effective.
[01:11:49.413 --> 01:11:51.795]  And then I want to obviously get into the big January 6th developments.
[01:11:52.255 --> 01:12:00.041]  Tucker Carlson, we now learn, has been given the January 6th footage, or is being allowed to go through it, by McCarthy.
[01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:01.862]  I know he's hot on the trail.
[01:12:01.963 --> 01:12:08.865]   I've got a lot of inside baseball on what's happening in the January 6 trial the proud boys. I know hoff is all over it
[01:12:08.865 --> 01:12:14.044]   as well. It has the same sources CIA operatives CIA sex operatives
[01:12:14.044 --> 01:12:20.425]   It looks like just incredible information. So Jim Hoff the gateway punta calm. Thanks for being here, sir
[01:12:20.425 --> 01:12:27.185]   Please go ahead and give us your views on Veritas on January 6 information coming on and so much more
[01:12:27.185 --> 01:12:31.885]   Good morning Alex great to be with you and the info wars crowd
[01:12:32.225 --> 01:12:36.025]  I think this news about James O'Keefe is tragic.
[01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:43.490]  I don't know how Project Veritas is going to have the same feel, is going to be able to put out the same products.
[01:12:43.730 --> 01:12:49.913]  The excellence in reporting that they've had without James O'Keefe, I think they might be fooling themselves.
[01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:56.656]  I'm really looking forward to what you just teased, and that is James may have an announcement on his future.
[01:12:56.676 --> 01:12:59.217]  I don't think James O'Keefe is going away.
[01:13:00.547 --> 01:13:08.892]  And what he has done to help expose so much in this country, the guy deserves a medal.
[01:13:09.532 --> 01:13:20.237]  Instead, we have Joe Biden giving medals to people like Ruby and Shay from Georgia, election workers there, and different people.
[01:13:20.357 --> 01:13:23.719]  And yet James O'Keefe is the one who really is saving this country, so.
[01:13:24.572 --> 01:13:27.075]  Uh, you know, I totally support James.
[01:13:27.115 --> 01:13:30.560]  I've known him for, you know, a dozen years, like you.
[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.442]  I think he's phenomenal.
[01:13:32.722 --> 01:13:37.007]  And, um, I look forward to more, um, more work by James O'Keefe.
[01:13:37.508 --> 01:13:43.856]  And as far as Project Veritas, uh, I don't know how they fill that huge hole that James will leave behind.
[01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:46.447]  Well, the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:13:46.467 --> 01:13:50.549]  The FBI was putting pressure on the board, threats of indictments, and now they've choked.
[01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:54.230]  I know O'Keefe, again, deserves a medal not to be indicted.
[01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:59.292]  They've already tried to arrest him and indict him one other time, supposedly for wiretapping, which wasn't true.
[01:14:00.212 --> 01:14:05.494]  Now, getting into January 6th, nobody's been on this like Gateway Pundit other than Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:06.534 --> 01:14:07.615]  We've obviously been very close to them.
[01:14:07.635 --> 01:14:08.615]  They've been trying to put me in jail.
[01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:13.777]  They're trying to put two of my crew members in jail for just being outside the Capitol as well.
[01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:19.361]  I know you've got some of the same sources, but man, this Proud Boys trial, so much is coming out.
[01:14:19.682 --> 01:14:24.746]  You wrote a great report, the 15 points that prove it was an inside false flag operation.
[01:14:26.148 --> 01:14:33.154]  Give us a little prelude on what you're working on and what you make of this development that Trucker Carlson is being given access to the 42,000 hours of footage.
[01:14:35.816 --> 01:14:38.560]  Well, I'm glad that it's coming out.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:47.432]  Over the weekend we saw a couple of reports that Kevin McCarthy was going to renege on what he had promised and I'm glad that that isn't the case.
[01:14:48.052 --> 01:14:50.536]  And so I'm very excited to hear.
[01:14:51.352 --> 01:14:56.414]  Uh, and to see some of this footage, uh, I suspect that McCarthy will release it publicly.
[01:14:56.434 --> 01:15:00.255]  Uh, I believe that he has the duty to do that.
[01:15:00.615 --> 01:15:07.898]  And, um, I know that Gateway Pundit, we will be looking forward to finding and scouring through all of that footage.
[01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:11.259]  I think Alex and I, I know that you'll agree with this.
[01:15:11.279 --> 01:15:17.721]  And that is that the more that we look at January 6th and by the way, I was sitting on.
[01:15:18.342 --> 01:15:26.687]  With an arm's reach from you on January 6th at the Ellipse before people marched over to the U.S.
[01:15:26.747 --> 01:15:27.267]  Capitol.
[01:15:28.548 --> 01:15:30.709]  And I'd never seen a larger crowd in my life.
[01:15:30.929 --> 01:15:34.611]  There was a million people there at least I would estimate.
[01:15:35.212 --> 01:15:37.013]  It went as far as I could see.
[01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.168]  Everyone was peaceful, like every Trump rally.
[01:15:40.648 --> 01:15:41.809]  Everyone was peaceful.
[01:15:42.729 --> 01:15:44.150]  We were very hopeful that day.
[01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:46.832]  Unfortunately, it did not turn out the way that we had planned.
[01:15:46.852 --> 01:15:52.435]  It did not turn out the way that Mike Pence had promised us, just within 48 hours beforehand.
[01:15:53.476 --> 01:15:55.477]  And so we saw what happened later on.
[01:15:55.577 --> 01:16:05.403]  But you know, Alex, the more we look into this, the more people we talk to, it appears that this was a planned, organized, coordinated event.
[01:16:06.021 --> 01:16:08.082]  To attack the American people.
[01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:22.652]  And the violence was started by the police who started firing rubber bullets and then firing off these gas canisters into the crowd.
[01:16:23.632 --> 01:16:28.275]  We now have footage that we're going to be putting up of one of these canisters.
[01:16:28.716 --> 01:16:30.377]  People are getting a little more bold now.
[01:16:30.497 --> 01:16:31.678]  They're sending us some stuff.
[01:16:32.118 --> 01:16:33.899]  A canister exploding right on somebody's face.
[01:16:34.178 --> 01:16:36.359]  You know, right next to him.
[01:16:36.639 --> 01:16:41.462]  So... That's right, a lot of the victims of January 6th have been afraid to speak out because of the persecution.
[01:16:41.822 --> 01:16:45.384]  And look at how the January 6th Commission came out and tried to seal it for 20 plus years.
[01:16:45.444 --> 01:16:55.890]  They've got to be really concerned right now because just the footage you and others dug up shows raps not just calling for an attack, but helping ram signs over the police and into the structure.
[01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:58.292]  So they have got to be really concerned right now.
[01:16:59.542 --> 01:17:01.623]  I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:17:01.843 --> 01:17:02.683]  They should be scared.
[01:17:02.723 --> 01:17:07.785]  And Liz Cheney is probably the one who's most upset because the truth is going to come out.
[01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:11.227]  And again, like I was saying, this was all premeditated.
[01:17:11.267 --> 01:17:13.468]  This was a coordinated attack on the American people.
[01:17:13.848 --> 01:17:14.928]  We have the evidence now.
[01:17:14.948 --> 01:17:16.829]  We're going to see more evidence coming forward.
[01:17:17.289 --> 01:17:43.299]   You know, we posted something last week on that Proud Boy trial that's going on and how Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, was approached by this woman who says that, she says now that this FBI trained, FBI CIA trained agent had told her to send this footage to Tarrio and make sure that he got it.
[01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:51.785]  Well, she sent it to him and now we know that this guy was working, I believe as a fed, certainly was trained as a fed that he admits to.
[01:17:53.286 --> 01:17:56.848]  And so this is, again, another setup before that day.
[01:17:57.308 --> 01:18:00.550]  It's really horrible, Alex, to see that this is what our government has been doing.
[01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:08.134]  I know you've been shouting this from the rooftops for years, but now we're really seeing this government was attacking its own people.
[01:18:08.554 --> 01:18:14.397]  And the disgrace is that these gentlemen and women who go to trial in D.C.
[01:18:14.797 --> 01:18:18.239]  who were there that day, they're getting the book thrown at them.
[01:18:19.103 --> 01:18:22.504]  For things like walking inside the Capitol.
[01:18:22.944 --> 01:18:27.086]  And I know you and the fact that you were outside that day.
[01:18:27.486 --> 01:18:28.286]  You didn't even go in.
[01:18:28.326 --> 01:18:32.548]  You were telling people to be calm and yet here they come and harass you and your staff.
[01:18:33.028 --> 01:18:34.968]  It's really horrible what we witnessed.
[01:18:35.108 --> 01:18:38.229]  And Ray Epps has never... We can turn it around.
[01:18:38.249 --> 01:18:38.630]  That's right.
[01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:42.691]  Ray Epps testified to the committee that he, quote, orchestrated it.
[01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:46.676]  But he's not been arrested like Owen Schroyer and Sam Montoya.
[01:18:46.796 --> 01:18:50.343]  Let's come back and talk more about this with the one and only Jim Hoffman, TheGatewayPundit.com.
[01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:55.008]  All right, Jim Hoft is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:55.428 --> 01:19:00.429]  TheGatewayPundit.com, another big guest coming up next hour, your phone calls and more.
[01:19:00.549 --> 01:19:11.651]  He wrote an excellent article, a boil-down at TheGatewayPundit.com, TheGatewayPundit.com, 15 facts on the dozens of federal operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th in the U.S.
[01:19:11.671 --> 01:19:12.071]  Capitol.
[01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:15.990]   And I've been told by people inside the trial, I'll leave it at that, the judge kicks everybody
[01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:20.871]   out, has these in-chamber meetings, also runs a white noise machine up at the, up at the,
[01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:25.810]   you know, judge's platform where you can't hear, and then tells the lawyers and people,
[01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:29.171]   you can't bring up the federal informants, you can't bring up the police with badges,
[01:19:29.171 --> 01:19:35.011]   you can't bring up the CIA people or the anti-terrorism teams that were there, you can't bring any
[01:19:35.011 --> 01:19:36.011]  of that up.
[01:19:36.011 --> 01:19:40.930]   But then they'll let information from informants come out by the prosecution, but not the informants,
[01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:45.850]   like the one that was driving the car that took Enrique Tarrio to the parking garage
[01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:48.011]  meeting with Stuart Rhodes and the Oath Keepers.
[01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:53.040]  That individual and others have testified in their reports that they saw no plans to attack the Capitol.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.541]  But the judge is keeping that out.
[01:19:54.822 --> 01:19:58.325]  This is a rigged kangaroo trial, and it looks like D.C.
[01:19:58.385 --> 01:20:00.687]  is their special star chamber facility, Jim.
[01:20:02.674 --> 01:20:03.595]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:04.015 --> 01:20:05.916]  It's heartbreaking to see that this is happening.
[01:20:05.956 --> 01:20:12.201]  There's no justice being served, and like you said, it's a kangaroo court, and these men are just like sheep to slaughter.
[01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:13.261]  It's disgusting.
[01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:20.326]  I don't know how these people sleep at night, these judges, these prosecutors, when they're destroying so many lives across the country.
[01:20:20.346 --> 01:20:21.687]  They just don't care.
[01:20:21.907 --> 01:20:23.948]  We're not dealing with very good people here, Alex.
[01:20:24.109 --> 01:20:25.389]  They're just not very good people.
[01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:27.331]  Gut level!
[01:20:28.354 --> 01:20:47.646]  What do you think happens, because already the footage we have is bombshell, when Tucker gets all the HD footage and the public gets it, we were talking during the break, you agree with me, just like Wikileaks, when they released 50,000 pages or 100,000 emails or 200,000 emails, there's no way one organization or one Matt Taibbi can take all the Twitter files.
[01:20:47.966 --> 01:20:50.466]  and decide what to put out from Elon Musk.
[01:20:50.466 --> 01:20:54.466]  I mean, it's something, but really it's close to nothing.
[01:20:54.466 --> 01:20:58.706]   Instead of just releasing the Twitter files, releasing the 42,000 hours,
[01:20:58.706 --> 01:21:02.266]   that's the only way we get to the bottom of it, because then hundreds of thousands of people
[01:21:02.266 --> 01:21:05.905]   will go download it, they'll pore over it, and we will get major results.
[01:21:05.905 --> 01:21:09.345]  Yeah, I believe you're right, Alex.
[01:21:09.013 --> 01:21:17.579]  And I think the biggest news to come out of this document drop will be after Kevin McCarthy releases it publicly.
[01:21:17.599 --> 01:21:24.184]  I think Tucker will be able to find some things, but you know, one person just can't go through that many hours worth of footage.
[01:21:24.904 --> 01:21:26.405]  But I'm looking forward to it.
[01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:31.509]  I think what Americans need to be looking for is why did the violence start?
[01:21:31.649 --> 01:21:32.870]  Who started the violence?
[01:21:33.294 --> 01:21:37.755]  Why was there no police saying, you know, leave the area or get arrested?
[01:21:37.775 --> 01:21:39.735]  There was no warning, they just started firing.
[01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:41.355]  I think that's going to be pivotal.
[01:21:41.675 --> 01:21:43.136]  I think Americans need to see that.
[01:21:43.516 --> 01:21:51.457]  And I think these people from that J6 committee need to be publicly shamed for the lies that they've been spreading for several years.
[01:21:51.897 --> 01:22:00.399]  I hope people never forget the lies that they told the American public, the Democrat Party, including Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, after the truth finally is released.
[01:22:01.099 --> 01:22:02.259]  And Jim, here's the key for me.
[01:22:03.422 --> 01:22:05.163]  I know you know this, you write about it constantly.
[01:22:06.163 --> 01:22:13.047]  They have branded the American people and any opposition as terrorists off of January 6th, and any Trump supporters as terrorists.
[01:22:13.507 --> 01:22:16.228]  So they're hanging their hat on this fraud.
[01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:18.209]  That's why it's so important to take down.
[01:22:18.289 --> 01:22:21.971]  Our listeners write me, they email me, they say, why are you covering January 6th?
[01:22:22.011 --> 01:22:23.072]  We know it was staged.
[01:22:23.452 --> 01:22:28.654]  Okay, well, the audience here and Gateway Pundit readers know it, but the general public still doesn't fully get it.
[01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:36.757]   Sure, in polls, What, like 6% of Americans think it's important and something like 80-something percent, you know, are against the war or think inflation is bad.
[01:22:36.998 --> 01:22:42.299]  The American people get it, but they don't understand we're all being branded as terrorists based on this fraud.
[01:22:42.339 --> 01:22:43.440]  We've got to bring this lie down.
[01:22:44.861 --> 01:23:03.971]  You know, a great example of that, too, Alex, and I agree with you 100 percent, is the fact that Americans, if you ask most Americans about that day, they would say maybe five police officers were killed that day because we have the President of the United States and Democrats spreading that lie continuously to this day.
[01:23:04.311 --> 01:23:06.192]  Of course, every bit of that is a lie.
[01:23:06.232 --> 01:23:08.053]  Not one police officer died that day.
[01:23:08.434 --> 01:23:12.656]  Officer Sicknick, of course, died the following day from a stroke.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:19.928]  Um, and then they're trying to say that these other policemen who committed suicide months later somehow did that because of January 6th.
[01:23:20.448 --> 01:23:22.931]  Um, we have, we have no proof of that at all, and neither do they.
[01:23:22.951 --> 01:23:25.755]  Uh, there were four individuals who did die that day.
[01:23:25.795 --> 01:23:27.276]  They were all Trump supporters.
[01:23:27.717 --> 01:23:30.280]  And you know, we put up a video this past weekend too.
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.182]  Of this woman, Victoria White, who was there.
[01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:34.262]  She's from Minnesota.
[01:23:34.563 --> 01:23:36.904]  You know, lower middle class, real sweet lady.
[01:23:37.284 --> 01:23:41.407]  She went there, she got pushed in this tunnel and they beat the living hell out of her.
[01:23:41.787 --> 01:23:44.609]  You know, there's one cop and we identified him in our report.
[01:23:44.989 --> 01:23:50.813]  He beat her with his bare fist for like 40 times with a stick and a fist right in her face.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:56.362]  We showed this horrific video of her right before they paraded her away then.
[01:23:56.402 --> 01:24:02.283]  Her shoes were knocked off, her coat was lost, and then they beat the hell out of her and dragged her through the U.S.
[01:24:02.323 --> 01:24:02.844]  Capitol.
[01:24:02.864 --> 01:24:04.844]  She didn't get out of jail until later that night.
[01:24:05.764 --> 01:24:07.505]  You know, she's not the criminal here.
[01:24:08.137 --> 01:24:09.338]  This cop is a criminal.
[01:24:09.438 --> 01:24:12.401]  How dare he do that to anyone, let alone a woman?
[01:24:12.901 --> 01:24:16.605]  Beat the living hell out of her when she just got pushed in this tunnel.
[01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:18.586]  She had no idea what was going on.
[01:24:18.907 --> 01:24:20.248]  It's really a horrible story.
[01:24:20.268 --> 01:24:21.689]  And there's several stories like that.
[01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:25.593]  I bet we see more of that as this footage is released.
[01:24:26.454 --> 01:24:27.094]  Big picture.
[01:24:28.816 --> 01:24:36.998]   What do you make of the deep state, the war in Ukraine, just the behavior of the Democrats They're just going more and more insane by the minute.
[01:24:37.198 --> 01:24:39.899]  What concerns you most when you go to bed at night?
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:49.305]  You know, the fact that we have Joe Biden as president and Mark Milley leading the Pentagon is frightening.
[01:24:49.765 --> 01:24:53.087]  These clowns don't have any idea what's going on.
[01:24:53.147 --> 01:24:57.790]  We have Milley, of course, calling China and warning them if we do anything, you know, whose side is he on?
[01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:59.751]  How come this guy hasn't been court-martialed?
[01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:09.219]   And yet he's still leading our troops after they lost And surrendered to the Taliban and armed them with $80 billion worth of U.S.
[01:25:09.279 --> 01:25:09.659]  weapons.
[01:25:10.079 --> 01:25:19.261]  In fact, Alex, we put something up this weekend on the Gateway Planet where they're now training pilots over there and Americans laugh, ha ha ha, they don't have shoes, right?
[01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:20.742]  The elites laugh about that.
[01:25:21.102 --> 01:25:29.204]  Well, they're training these shoeless pilots to run the helicopters that Mark Milley left there in Afghanistan after we pulled out.
[01:25:29.444 --> 01:25:32.385]  It's such a disgrace, such a disaster.
[01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:39.432]  We see also, one more point quickly, Jimmy Carter, they named a building after Jimmy Carter.
[01:25:39.472 --> 01:25:44.274]  They took the previous name off of this building at the Naval Academy.
[01:25:44.434 --> 01:25:51.876]  It was named after the founder of oceanography, this patriotic American who also happened to be a Confederate general.
[01:25:52.296 --> 01:25:54.477]  So they removed his name and put Jimmy Carter on there.
[01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:55.397]  Think of Jimmy Carter.
[01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:57.638]  We have Iran today because of Jimmy Carter.
[01:25:57.998 --> 01:26:05.485]  We have the mullahs in charge and wreaking havoc across the world, not just the Middle East, but we saw them bomb down in Argentina years ago.
[01:26:05.825 --> 01:26:10.709]  This is Jimmy Carter's, you know, legacy and now they're naming military buildings after him?
[01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:12.551]  Nothing makes sense, Alex.
[01:26:12.871 --> 01:26:13.151]  Nothing.
[01:26:13.171 --> 01:26:13.532]  Well, that's right.
[01:26:13.552 --> 01:26:15.774]  They always say it was Reagan that armed the Taliban.
[01:26:15.874 --> 01:26:19.077]  It was actually Jimmy Carter, was Zbigniew Brzezinski that started all that.
[01:26:19.117 --> 01:26:24.782]  Reagan adopted that after and I think that was probably not a good idea, but I mean, Jimmy Carter was super bad news.
[01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:27.231]  Absolutely.
[01:26:27.311 --> 01:26:38.576]  And, you know, the priorities of this administration, I think, you know, Joe Biden though, Jimmy Carter makes, you know, Joe Biden makes Jimmy Carter look like some kind of saint.
[01:26:38.897 --> 01:26:40.757]  Joe Biden is a complete disaster.
[01:26:40.797 --> 01:26:43.719]  Do we want him to lead World War III or America?
[01:26:43.739 --> 01:26:45.139]  I don't think so.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.080]  I don't think so.
[01:26:47.423 --> 01:26:53.127]  In the time we have left, Jim Hoft, we've talked privately about this, but I concur with what you said.
[01:26:53.147 --> 01:26:59.411]  Can you repeat what you said during the break about this whole split between Trump and DeSantis and how we should deal with that?
[01:27:01.292 --> 01:27:05.715]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, and we of course didn't have a primary in 2020.
[01:27:06.909 --> 01:27:08.570]  But we did in 2016.
[01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.891]  I know that you were always pro-Trump, so were we.
[01:27:11.731 --> 01:27:15.393]  But those primaries get pretty vicious on the Republican side.
[01:27:15.473 --> 01:27:18.194]  There's a lot of people who really get some heated emotions.
[01:27:18.674 --> 01:27:26.277]  We put up something last week about DeSantis and George Soros said some things about him that were pretty flattering compared to what he said about Trump.
[01:27:27.318 --> 01:27:30.319]  And we just got viciously attacked.
[01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:32.360]  I don't look forward to a primary.
[01:27:32.813 --> 01:27:35.595]  Between Trump and DeSantis at all.
[01:27:36.036 --> 01:27:39.598]  And I think it's going to be really difficult for the party.
[01:27:40.939 --> 01:27:45.203]  But I think the real foe that we have to worry about is election fraud still.
[01:27:45.363 --> 01:27:50.767]  I think, as I told you during break, Democrats could run John Fetterman from his hospital bed.
[01:27:51.748 --> 01:27:57.453]  And he would still beat the Republican if they don't figure out this fraud, because that's the real enemy of the country.
[01:27:57.754 --> 01:28:00.116]  We have to get that figured out to save this country.
[01:28:00.616 --> 01:28:06.102]  Isn't Fetterman and Biden emblematic of the rot of the Democratic Party, that they both can barely talk?
[01:28:06.162 --> 01:28:11.447]  Fetterman's in the hospital with depression, and they almost killed him running him, and they just don't care.
[01:28:12.901 --> 01:28:14.261]  Yeah, they don't care at all.
[01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:17.982]  I liked his wife's statement, like, uh, yeah, we're gonna make sure he gets some rest.
[01:28:18.022 --> 01:28:22.243]  Well, she didn't feel that way after he had that stroke, and she pushed him out on the campaign trail.
[01:28:22.823 --> 01:28:30.785]  And, um, you know, I don't believe that, uh, Pennsylvania voters are that stupid to nominate somebody who can't even think to be their senator.
[01:28:30.865 --> 01:28:31.865]  Oh, yeah, crawl over it.
[01:28:31.945 --> 01:28:36.166]  And what you said during the break was, Trump and DeSantis shouldn't be fighting with each other.
[01:28:36.226 --> 01:28:38.087]  If they don't fix the election fraud, it's not gonna matter.
[01:28:39.526 --> 01:28:40.807]  That's totally it.
[01:28:40.907 --> 01:28:45.650]  That's the real enemy, and we have to get that figured out, or this country's lost, and you know it, Alex.
[01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:50.933]  Well, TheGatewayPundit.com, and you're on the trail, we're on the trail, Tucker's on the trail.
[01:28:51.333 --> 01:28:54.215]  Cannot wait to see what Tucker puts out with the January 6th Motherload.
[01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:55.636]  Thank you so much, Jim Hoffman.
[01:28:56.817 --> 01:28:57.437]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:28:57.938 --> 01:28:58.538]  Good to be with you.
[01:28:58.558 --> 01:28:59.098]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:59.158 --> 01:28:59.398]  Wow.
[01:28:59.919 --> 01:29:00.319]  All right.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:07.844]  I'm going to jam in a few phone calls when we come back, and then Stu Peters is loaded for bear with a whole bunch of big key topics.
[01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:10.838]  He's going to be covering, coming up here very soon.
[01:29:10.858 --> 01:29:11.899]  I'm going to go on a break.
[01:29:13.039 --> 01:29:16.081]  Come back in two minutes with your calls and then Stu Peter straight ahead.
[01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.601]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[01:29:17.421 --> 01:29:33.421]  And now let's how we override the sensors.
[01:29:33.407 --> 01:29:37.230]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:41.673]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[01:29:41.813 --> 01:29:49.179]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase.
[01:29:49.279 --> 01:29:51.421]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[01:29:51.621 --> 01:29:57.265]   This one is the only Enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[01:29:57.305 --> 01:29:58.066]  This is very important.
[01:29:58.086 --> 01:30:02.909]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[01:30:03.129 --> 01:30:04.610]  People are low with the spike protein.
[01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:05.470]  They don't feel well.
[01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:07.191]  This is a potential solution.
[01:30:07.292 --> 01:30:10.253]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[01:30:10.353 --> 01:30:13.135]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[01:30:13.255 --> 01:30:14.256]  Isn't it interesting?
[01:30:14.636 --> 01:30:20.480]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:25.221]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[01:30:25.241 --> 01:30:26.841]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[01:30:27.821 --> 01:30:36.443]  If you leave me, I won't miss you, and I won't ever take you back.
[01:30:39.283 --> 01:30:41.084]  Let's just go fishing and listen to George Strait.
[01:30:41.124 --> 01:30:41.744]  How's that sound?
[01:30:43.804 --> 01:30:45.664]  But then the mushroom clouds will start.
[01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:47.965]  They'll release a new bioweapon.
[01:30:48.705 --> 01:30:49.225]  So we can't.
[01:30:50.438 --> 01:30:50.919]  Got a fight.
[01:30:53.422 --> 01:30:54.724]  I got some oceanfront property.
[01:30:57.769 --> 01:31:00.333]  Texas Roughneck in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:31:01.274 --> 01:31:04.178]  Hey Alex, we were talking, you were mentioning January 6th.
[01:31:06.403 --> 01:31:21.830]  I'm just afraid after two years they've had too much time to do like a Steve Mnuchin production and frame it or even make new video and say it happened on January 6th, putting Patriots in a bad light, and how that relates to UK and what you had suggested about them being the hub of the New World Order.
[01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:28.033]  Yeah, I think with 41,000 hours of footage, most of those Capitol Police aren't corrupt, they're just brainwashed.
[01:31:28.593 --> 01:31:32.014]  They would have too much trouble going in and then deleting stuff.
[01:31:32.034 --> 01:31:35.496]  They might delete some stuff over that time, but I don't think they're going to produce fake stuff and put it on there.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:41.226]  Well, and it's when you said that UK was the hub of New World Order, I kind of disagree with you.
[01:31:41.666 --> 01:31:54.320]  I think, you know, Greg Rees did a good report on revelation of the method, and, you know, the UK wasn't the ones who cancelled Kanye's bank accounts or all of his contracts, all in unison, working together to censor a certain amount of information.
[01:31:54.681 --> 01:32:01.313]   If you look at Israel's Supreme Court building, that kind of identifies where the hub of the New World Order is.
[01:32:01.334 --> 01:32:03.075]  Yeah, sure, it's a big pyramid.
[01:32:03.135 --> 01:32:06.438]  Well, who founded Israel, the modern state of Israel?
[01:32:06.458 --> 01:32:07.199]  The Rothschilds.
[01:32:11.533 --> 01:32:13.353]  Everybody fights over this group or that group.
[01:32:13.514 --> 01:32:19.236]  I'm saying the propaganda, the brainwashing, the development, the British Empire never went away.
[01:32:19.296 --> 01:32:20.797]  It merged with the American Empire.
[01:32:21.437 --> 01:32:22.758]  Israel is a big part of that.
[01:32:23.138 --> 01:32:24.299]  The Vatican is a big part of that.
[01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:27.020]  So I'm not saying Israel is involved in some stuff.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.461]  You're totally missing my point.
[01:32:28.481 --> 01:32:30.742]  I'm talking about the City of London within London.
[01:32:31.162 --> 01:32:34.504]  That is the admitted financial center of the planet, sir.
[01:32:36.125 --> 01:32:40.588]  Is that where the bank was that cancelled all those accounts and are continuing to cancel Patriot accounts?
[01:32:40.628 --> 01:32:42.289]  Canada was cancelling the truckers accounts.
[01:32:42.729 --> 01:32:43.890]  Canada was doing the same thing.
[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:49.033]  Sir, there's a global... See, you want to disagree with me, and I'm not even disagreeing with you.
[01:32:49.734 --> 01:32:51.054]  And I really appreciate you.
[01:32:51.555 --> 01:32:54.677]  Texas, Roughneck, you're not listening to me.
[01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:56.398]  You're not listening.
[01:32:56.898 --> 01:32:58.299]  It's a global system.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:08.053]   I'm saying that the Do you understand that the Balfour Agreement, that the UK created Israel, do you understand that?
[01:33:09.395 --> 01:33:10.476]  Yes, with Rothschilds.
[01:33:11.057 --> 01:33:11.617]  What I just said.
[01:33:12.498 --> 01:33:13.479]  Yeah, that's what you said.
[01:33:13.519 --> 01:33:14.280]  I appreciate your call.
[01:33:14.901 --> 01:33:22.868]   It's just like, people fetishize Saying Israel runs everything, and I'm not disagreeing that Israel isn't a big part of the New World Order.
[01:33:22.888 --> 01:33:30.873]  There are a lot of good people over there, but look how they made them take all the experimental shots, and Netanyahu said they're guinea pigs that he basically owns, and it's terrible!
[01:33:31.553 --> 01:33:53.983]   But I'm explaining to you that the transhumanist stuff, the trans movement, the whole eugenics operation, Galton in the 1850s, I'm saying the banning of the books, I'm saying China is the big testing ground for the New World Order for the social credit score and all the rest of it, okay?
[01:33:54.203 --> 01:33:56.004]  I'm not saying China runs the world, okay?
[01:33:56.725 --> 01:33:57.085]  Okay?
[01:33:57.886 --> 01:34:03.710]  I'm saying China is the big New World Order economic military army they're using to take over.
[01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:10.755]  When I say China owns four of the six big Hollywood production houses, I'm not saying they run them, I'm saying they own them.
[01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:16.199]  So every time I talk about China, hey, don't talk about China, Israel, Israel!
[01:34:17.929 --> 01:34:30.862]  It's like, it just blows me away that people just think that they just magically say something about Israel that does something, that I'm here agreeing with you, basically, and then you think that you keep going back.
[01:34:32.143 --> 01:34:41.352]  Yes, the world financial system, the social credit score system, is being run out of Frankfurt, London, and New York City.
[01:34:42.406 --> 01:34:43.826]  And you're sitting there bashing Israel.
[01:34:44.147 --> 01:34:47.148]  Well, the people that run Israel run New York as well.
[01:34:47.528 --> 01:34:49.188]  It's the same global combines.
[01:34:49.288 --> 01:34:59.011]  And I'm agreeing with you and you won't let me do that because it feels too good to get Alex and say, man, you didn't tell the big dirty secret.
[01:34:59.972 --> 01:35:01.212]  And it's just bizarre.
[01:35:02.292 --> 01:35:03.953]  Who brought Kanye West in here?
[01:35:04.673 --> 01:35:05.273]  Dodo Bird.
[01:35:06.654 --> 01:35:07.534]  All right, I'm not mad at you.
[01:35:07.554 --> 01:35:08.634]  It's just very frustrating.
[01:35:08.895 --> 01:35:10.095]  Stu Peters in 60 seconds.
[01:35:11.096 --> 01:35:15.157]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[01:35:15.257 --> 01:35:18.818]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[01:35:19.018 --> 01:35:20.538]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[01:35:20.598 --> 01:35:23.119]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[01:35:23.779 --> 01:35:26.340]  This is a different kind of war.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.361]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[01:35:31.581 --> 01:35:34.782]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[01:35:34.962 --> 01:35:38.923]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold floor.
[01:35:38.802 --> 01:35:41.443]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion.
[01:35:41.443 --> 01:35:42.962]  It just can't happen.
[01:35:42.962 --> 01:35:44.962]  We need to go into the Capitol.
[01:35:44.962 --> 01:35:48.802]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:50.591]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:35:50.651 --> 01:35:53.013]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[01:35:53.453 --> 01:35:54.974]  You silenced those voices.
[01:35:55.054 --> 01:35:58.837]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[01:35:58.777 --> 01:36:05.777]   Soon as we start exposing the great reset, the Suda thief globalists start going to prison!
[01:36:05.777 --> 01:36:09.777]  [Applause]
[01:36:10.777 --> 01:36:15.777]  Popular talk show host Stu Peters is our guest for the hour.
[01:36:16.285 --> 01:36:17.567]  StuPeters.com.
[01:36:17.768 --> 01:36:18.750]  Needs no introduction.
[01:36:19.852 --> 01:36:23.780]  Thomas, we're getting into his development of the bioweapon, how our own government has used COVID.
[01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:28.280]  Food plant fires, train derailments, open war on American cities.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.082]  We live in an empire of lies.
[01:36:30.522 --> 01:36:31.663]  Stu Peters, great to have you.
[01:36:32.103 --> 01:36:40.049]  When I saw the first topic you wanted to get into, I thought of all the hype of the Marburg virus by the UN saying 90% of those that get infected die.
[01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:47.215]  Imagine the hysteria we saw with something as dangerous as the flu with COVID, with something that actually kills 90% of people.
[01:36:47.255 --> 01:36:49.036]  I think that's an exaggeration, but that's what they're saying.
[01:36:49.477 --> 01:36:51.418]  I think it's pretty clear COVID was a beta test.
[01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:53.340]  They're getting ready for something new.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.581]  Stu, great to have you with us.
[01:36:55.905 --> 01:36:57.045]  Yeah, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:36:57.065 --> 01:37:00.146]  There's no doubt that 100% of what you just articulated is true.
[01:37:00.186 --> 01:37:09.169]  I mean, we have an empire of lies, a fake government, a corporate government crime syndicate that has openly declared biowarfare on its own citizens.
[01:37:09.389 --> 01:37:16.571]  And one of the most alarming things is, you know, by omission, the criminal press has completely led people to their own slaughter.
[01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:25.717]   And this is like world governments are all in lockstep together working To accomplish this, remember the lies that we were told about COVID-19.
[01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:28.020]  We were told lies about spreading an infection.
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.501]  We were told lies about masking.
[01:37:29.521 --> 01:37:31.824]  We were told lies about safe and effective vaccines.
[01:37:31.844 --> 01:37:34.767]  We were told lies about the pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:37:35.268 --> 01:37:38.591]  We were told lies about, you know, hospitals caring for patients.
[01:37:38.611 --> 01:37:41.114]  How we couldn't be around grandma and grandpa in the nursing homes.
[01:37:41.946 --> 01:37:54.418]  We couldn't be next to our loved ones in the hospitals who walked in under their own horsepower, who were otherwise perfectly healthy people, and reported the sniffles or a cough before anybody knew what this COVID-19 thing was all about.
[01:37:54.838 --> 01:38:04.586]   We were led to our own slaughter as they were given this deadly remdesivir protocol, this venomous product that It goes through your veins and courses through causing renal failure.
[01:38:04.986 --> 01:38:06.828]  It failed an African Ebola trial.
[01:38:06.888 --> 01:38:07.908]  Tony Fauci knew that.
[01:38:07.968 --> 01:38:10.230]  He was responsible for getting it into the Ebola trial.
[01:38:10.570 --> 01:38:20.416]  The NIH dictated this one single treatment to every hospital facility here and then threatened doctors that if they didn't use this protocol, well, guess what?
[01:38:20.456 --> 01:38:21.697]  They were going to lose their licenses.
[01:38:22.077 --> 01:38:23.338]  So they coerced the doctors.
[01:38:23.358 --> 01:38:27.781]  They coerced everybody in big corporate America, all of the globalist conglomerates.
[01:38:27.821 --> 01:38:29.322]  The NFL is a great example.
[01:38:30.063 --> 01:38:54.600]   You know they report what nearly a hundred percent of the players and personnel for these teams are injected with this bioweapon and then boom all of a sudden as you know programs like yours and ours start to dig into this we have people coming forward with patents and showing when all this was actually developed this is they tell you right here this is a pegylated lipid nanoparticle this Weapon of Biowarfare, according to their patents.
[01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:56.244]  And this isn't just some arbitrary patent.
[01:38:56.385 --> 01:39:01.979]  This is a patent that was used across every single COVID injection vaccine that they told you was safe and effective.
[01:39:02.825 --> 01:39:18.318]  This instructs your body to produce billions of spike proteins, billions of venomous peptides that course through your veins and cause all kinds of autoimmune deficiencies and antibody-dependent enhancement and Guillain-Barre and myocarditis.
[01:39:18.978 --> 01:39:29.507]  Every single one of these symptoms is listed as the effect, as the adverse event or side effect, we believe, intended consequences of a bioweapon that they unleashed on the world.
[01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:31.247]  And nobody's talking about it.
[01:39:31.767 --> 01:39:43.590]  Not one person's talking about it, similar to the same way it took 10 days for the criminal press to talk about how this government Chernobyl-ed a city in Ohio, East Palestine, Ohio.
[01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:46.750]  I mean, this is accountability.
[01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:49.211]  We have to move to the accountability phase right now, I believe.
[01:39:49.691 --> 01:39:53.892]  And the first people that we should focus on are the press, who have led people directly to their deaths.
[01:39:54.591 --> 01:39:57.416]  Well, as Trump says, the mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
[01:39:57.456 --> 01:39:58.377]  They're totally discredited.
[01:39:58.878 --> 01:40:01.242]  All the polls show they have less than a 10% approval rating.
[01:40:01.702 --> 01:40:03.706]  But they're a zombie organization.
[01:40:03.726 --> 01:40:04.827]  They're funded by the big banks.
[01:40:04.867 --> 01:40:07.972]  They don't stop pulling back to the million-foot view here.
[01:40:09.343 --> 01:40:28.341]  With the open borders, and the fentanyl, and the pedophilia, and the world government being announced, and Elon Musk crying, and the war in Russia spiraling out of control, and just all of this together, how would you describe the world today, and how would you describe how it's going for the New World Order, for Team Demon versus Team Freedom?
[01:40:28.361 --> 01:40:31.745]  If this was a football game at halftime, what's going on?
[01:40:33.324 --> 01:40:34.265]  Well, we're getting crushed.
[01:40:35.025 --> 01:40:38.227]  And the reason why we're getting crushed is because of the lack of unification.
[01:40:38.247 --> 01:40:44.990]  There's factions inside of, you know, every single quote movement, the health freedom movement, you know, the Republican Party.
[01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:47.772]  There's factions inside of specific factions like MAGA.
[01:40:48.132 --> 01:40:54.015]  You know, there's the gay MAGA versus the straight MAGA and there's Catholics versus Protestants and Jews.
[01:40:54.175 --> 01:40:58.901]   And I mean, Like, this is an attempt to divide everybody and they're doing it successfully.
[01:40:58.961 --> 01:40:59.642]  This is Agenda 2030.
[01:40:59.722 --> 01:41:02.045]  We're watching it happen right in front of us.
[01:41:02.085 --> 01:41:04.929]  This is one world government, world domination.
[01:41:05.009 --> 01:41:16.580]   Consider testimony that was given by a former secret agent of an operation called Men in Black who said, Look, Gabe Testimony saying, there's going to be an alien invasion.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.461]  And in this alien invasion, people across the globe are going to see, you know, hundreds or thousands of alien ships in the sky.
[01:41:24.481 --> 01:41:25.862]  These are going to be holograms.
[01:41:26.282 --> 01:41:38.045]   And that the attack, in fact, won't come from these holograms, but will come from actual warplanes of governments around the world, including the United States of America, which then forces a one world government that nobody will Resist!
[01:41:38.166 --> 01:41:43.014]  Everybody will be dependent on this one world government in order to save us, to take care of us.
[01:41:43.454 --> 01:41:46.620]  This is the man riding in on the white horse to save us type thing.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:47.461]  Everybody's waiting.
[01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:48.844]  They've chilled patriotism.
[01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:55.079]  They've completely stomped over the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, the Geneva War Conventions.
[01:41:55.979 --> 01:42:11.885]  You talked about Ukraine and Russia, for example, were coming up this Friday on the one-year anniversary of the alleged, you know, warmongering boogeyman, Vladimir Putin, just violently deciding he was going to wake up one day and be a war criminal and go invade some innocent country.
[01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:13.446]  What's really happening in Ukraine?
[01:42:13.466 --> 01:42:21.390]   Well, Victoria Nuland tells us directly Right in front of Marco Rubio who was asking her a question and almost had to go shut her up because she was going to tell us all everything.
[01:42:22.230 --> 01:42:25.352]  Dozens of bioweapons laboratories being hidden in Ukraine.
[01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:36.257]  This is the same government that paid millions, maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Hunter Biden and the Biden crime family through a false and fraudulent energy company called Burisma.
[01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:39.539]  And now Biden, that's what I wanted to ask you next, now Biden's over there.
[01:42:40.579 --> 01:42:48.068]   When we pull back from this, And you have Biden eight months ago saying we can't send Abrams tanks, that'll be World War III.
[01:42:48.568 --> 01:42:51.489]  Now he's sent the Abrams tanks, they're now going into combat.
[01:42:51.949 --> 01:43:00.152]  What changed the power structure from eight months ago where they said we can't send Abrams tanks to now, they're sending heavier and heavier advanced weapons?
[01:43:01.246 --> 01:43:07.412]  Well, these corrupt fossils in our uniparty fake government, these warmongers in the D.C.
[01:43:07.472 --> 01:43:13.098]  Beltway, have to figure out a way to enrich themselves through the military-industrial complex.
[01:43:14.591 --> 01:43:16.972]  Alex, you're very well versed on how these wars go.
[01:43:17.012 --> 01:43:21.414]  I mean, look back all the way to the lies that got us into Iraq, weapons of mass destruction.
[01:43:21.575 --> 01:43:24.376]  And then, you know, Saddam Hussein ties to Al Qaeda.
[01:43:24.436 --> 01:43:26.637]  Whoops, spoiler alert, all that turned out to be fake.
[01:43:26.657 --> 01:43:27.898]  There were no WMDs.
[01:43:28.238 --> 01:43:29.879]  Those ties to Al Qaeda were all fake.
[01:43:29.899 --> 01:43:32.500]  So then it became about, you know, spreading democracy.
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:35.221]  The same thing happened with Obama's red line in Syria.
[01:43:35.261 --> 01:43:37.502]  The same thing happened to get us involved in Libya.
[01:43:37.562 --> 01:43:38.523]  We had Benghazi.
[01:43:38.603 --> 01:43:40.664]  Lies after lies to cover this up.
[01:43:41.244 --> 01:43:43.566]  And now you mentioned the pedophilia cabal.
[01:43:44.087 --> 01:43:46.829]  They've got a lot of bodies to hide in Ukraine.
[01:43:46.909 --> 01:43:50.233]  And those people, if you go to the Donbass right now, what do you see there?
[01:43:50.273 --> 01:43:51.394]  You see mass graves.
[01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:53.455]  This happened under Zelensky's leadership.
[01:43:53.556 --> 01:43:54.416]  Who is Zelensky?
[01:43:54.777 --> 01:44:01.943]  I mean, the guy that wears high heels and leather, closely tied to the very same people who are right at the epicenter of the elites right here.
[01:44:02.664 --> 01:44:04.706]  Forty million dollar mansions in Miami.
[01:44:05.501 --> 01:44:18.845]  This is an actor, this is all theatrics to distract away what's actually happening right now, which is that your government has been hijacked via Marxist coup d'etat by some illegitimate force that is controlling what you're seeing happen in the White House right now.
[01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:21.826]  There's a reason why they do all their broadcasts from a fake movie set.
[01:44:22.306 --> 01:44:26.888]  Nobody has any idea what the power structure is right now or who's actually pulling the strings.
[01:44:27.368 --> 01:44:27.848]  Well, you're right.
[01:44:27.888 --> 01:44:30.429]  Let's talk about that when we come back with Stu Peters here.
[01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:32.930]  On this Monday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:35.670]  Because the globalists really are at war with humanity.
[01:44:36.091 --> 01:44:36.971]  They're at war with the Russians.
[01:44:36.991 --> 01:44:37.991]  They're at war with the Americans.
[01:44:38.031 --> 01:44:42.913]  They're at war with productivity, with prosperity, with common sense, with logic.
[01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:44.213]  What is the endgame?
[01:44:44.313 --> 01:44:45.053]  How do we stop it?
[01:44:45.113 --> 01:44:45.794]  How do we defeat it?
[01:44:45.814 --> 01:44:52.576]  I'm going to look at the attacks on the infrastructure and so much more with Stu Peters of StuPeters.com and on Twitter at RealStuPeters.
[01:44:53.516 --> 01:45:02.385]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, the only way this transmission gets out is you share the links from Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show and ConspiracyFact.info is a link that's not been censored yet.
[01:45:02.665 --> 01:45:03.927]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:45:03.947 --> 01:45:04.627]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:05.663 --> 01:45:16.172]  You know, I've reached a surreal moment here as a father, and as somebody that loves my family, that means I love everybody else as we all live on this planet together, where I'm just beyond angry at these people.
[01:45:16.932 --> 01:45:23.437]  You have Joe Biden saying, if we send heavy battle tanks, it'll be World War III, because it escalates into that, and then now he's doing it.
[01:45:24.358 --> 01:45:31.341]  And they just sit back and laugh, and they have vogue photo shoots with Zelensky, and he dances around like a woman in high heels wearing leather.
[01:45:31.861 --> 01:45:35.743]  And it's all just a sick end of days feeling.
[01:45:35.763 --> 01:45:36.683]  But then I get hope.
[01:45:36.744 --> 01:45:42.606]  I don't trust him much, but Elon Musk addresses the World Government Summit and says, your world government will collapse civilization.
[01:45:42.946 --> 01:45:44.847]  Here's Biden with the tank comment.
[01:45:44.867 --> 01:45:46.628]  I know it's a month old, but it's important.
[01:45:47.674 --> 01:46:05.184]  The idea, the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand, and don't kid yourself no matter what you all say, that's called World War III.
[01:46:06.064 --> 01:46:06.404]  Okay?
[01:46:07.405 --> 01:46:18.940]   And now, Stu Peters, as you know, The new defense minister over in Ukraine today said we'll invade Russia and capture Moscow and put our tanks in Red Square.
[01:46:19.141 --> 01:46:21.563]  Why would they make such insane, provocative statements?
[01:46:21.923 --> 01:46:27.709]  Why a few months ago would Zelensky fire missiles, it looks like on purpose, into Poland and instantly call for nuclear war?
[01:46:28.110 --> 01:46:30.332]  What is going on with these people, Stu Peters, in your view?
[01:46:32.655 --> 01:46:34.095]  They're desperate to bury bodies.
[01:46:34.356 --> 01:46:42.478]  They have to absolutely have to seal the deal with World War 3 in order to have enough chaos all over to affect the 2030 agenda.
[01:46:43.038 --> 01:47:00.863]  Whether they have to fake it with fake Chinese spy balloons that embarrassingly fly over our country while meanwhile an article from just three years ago says hey the United States government the military apparatus is going to be testing spy balloons and we're going to be launching them from South Dakota over the Midwest and making their final into Illinois.
[01:47:01.423 --> 01:47:18.497]  As you look around at what's happening with Russia and Ukraine, why is it that we're supposed to believe that Vladimir Putin, just by sheer numbers, let's just talk about straight facts here without injecting any feelings or subjection at all whatsoever, Vladimir Putin has access to about a million troops active duty.
[01:47:18.958 --> 01:47:22.681]  He's got another 2.04 million in reserves.
[01:47:22.721 --> 01:47:28.663]   He's got a Navy, he's got an Air Force, ostensibly he has intercontinental ballistic warheads.
[01:47:28.663 --> 01:47:32.922]   He could take care of Ukraine if he really wanted to conquer them in a mission that lasts
[01:47:32.922 --> 01:47:34.303]  approximately 20 minutes.
[01:47:34.303 --> 01:47:39.223]   I mean, why not just drop one big bomb over the top of Ukraine and just turn it into glass
[01:47:39.223 --> 01:47:41.342]  and just obliterate everything?
[01:47:41.342 --> 01:47:42.702]  Why is it taking so long?
[01:47:42.739 --> 01:47:46.640]  Why is he strategically targeting, you know, specific sites?
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.861]  Why does he have high value targets versus low?
[01:47:48.921 --> 01:47:54.383]  Why did Vladimir Putin send in trains to try to get people out of there as a humanitarian effort?
[01:47:54.463 --> 01:47:57.784]  Why don't people know the real history of Ukraine or how it started 400 years ago?
[01:47:57.884 --> 01:47:59.285]  Ukraine wasn't a country at all.
[01:47:59.745 --> 01:48:03.768]  It was settled by Russians who would rather just be Russia most of the time.
[01:48:04.168 --> 01:48:09.472]  And it turns out that the same lies about Afghanistan, about our government, and how disgustingly corrupt it was.
[01:48:09.813 --> 01:48:10.273]  Well, guess what?
[01:48:10.573 --> 01:48:18.139]  The people of Afghanistan, it turns out, would rather have the Taliban than anything that we did, turning our heads while warlords raped little boys.
[01:48:18.719 --> 01:48:22.464]  You know, teaching Pashtun tribesmen the importance of transgenderism?
[01:48:22.564 --> 01:48:23.465]  These people are freaks.
[01:48:23.505 --> 01:48:29.232]  You just showed this Volodymyr Zelensky fake actor model, you know, dancing around in leather.
[01:48:29.312 --> 01:48:31.074]  He was playing the piano with his penis.
[01:48:31.113 --> 01:48:36.713]   I mean, these are disgusting, demonic, depraved, sick individuals who want to run the world
[01:48:36.713 --> 01:48:38.912]  and have everybody else be a subservient class.
[01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:43.632]   So of course, when anybody starts to adopt more pro-Russia policies, what happens?
[01:48:43.632 --> 01:48:45.753]  Well, what happened in 2014?
[01:48:45.753 --> 01:48:50.933]   Our CIA affected a violent coup d'etat for an administration that both sides in Ukraine
[01:48:50.933 --> 01:48:52.992]  suggest and admit that the vote was fair.
[01:48:52.992 --> 01:48:56.073]  It was a democratically elected administration.
[01:48:56.073 --> 01:49:00.193]   When that administration started to develop more pro-Russia policies, which by the way,
[01:49:00.193 --> 01:49:03.552]  a pro-Russia policy is being a nationalist, right?
[01:49:03.596 --> 01:49:05.017]  He is a Russian nationalist.
[01:49:05.037 --> 01:49:06.138]  He puts his country first.
[01:49:06.178 --> 01:49:07.519]  I mean, what an idea is that?
[01:49:07.559 --> 01:49:08.900]  How refreshing would that be?
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:15.284]  He's an Orthodox Christian who's built 40,000 churches in his time there, and these are not disgusting abominations.
[01:49:15.324 --> 01:49:18.846]  These are beautiful cathedrals and places of worship ensconced in gold.
[01:49:20.207 --> 01:49:22.709]  He kicked out the central criminal banking cabal.
[01:49:22.749 --> 01:49:24.950]  He wanted energy independence.
[01:49:25.050 --> 01:49:30.173]  All the things that take care of Russians and 50% of the Ukrainians didn't want to be there in Ukraine.
[01:49:30.513 --> 01:49:32.474]  So our CIA affected a violent coup.
[01:49:32.815 --> 01:49:35.916]  They used the BLM style popular uprising tactic.
[01:49:35.937 --> 01:49:39.359]  Then they paid off our press to convince the rest of the world that that's what this was.
[01:49:40.439 --> 01:49:45.242]  All they were doing in 2014 was practicing the same tactics that they would later use here in 2020.
[01:49:45.342 --> 01:49:52.026]  We had George Floyd, a career criminal home-invading thug, die right down the street from me here in Minneapolis of a fentanyl overdose.
[01:49:52.426 --> 01:49:59.050]  He died just like you would expect any career criminal home-invading thug to die early and with a contact with law enforcement.
[01:49:59.310 --> 01:50:00.491]  They locked those guys up.
[01:50:00.531 --> 01:50:02.913]  They blast out how it was a racist attack and a murder.
[01:50:02.933 --> 01:50:04.654]   They locked Sure.
[01:50:04.714 --> 01:50:06.836]  Black Lives Matter is their color revolution here.
[01:50:06.856 --> 01:50:11.280]  And Brzezinski and all of them called for it before he died about five years ago, six years ago.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:19.988]  And on top of that, we have people like George Soros going on CNN over Reed Zakaria five, six years ago, admitting that they'd overthrown Ukraine.
[01:50:20.008 --> 01:50:21.370]  We're already in a proxy war with Russia.
[01:50:22.754 --> 01:50:25.035]  These people have been caught telling so many lies.
[01:50:25.716 --> 01:50:30.379]  These lies have directly led to the deaths of millions and millions of Americans.
[01:50:30.439 --> 01:50:32.460]  They have caused infertility and sterility.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.501]  They have caused a died suddenly pandemic.
[01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:38.644]  The number one phrase being used in obituaries worldwide.
[01:50:39.144 --> 01:50:44.127]  This is 100% the biggest kill-off that we have ever seen and they have to complete it.
[01:50:44.187 --> 01:50:46.488]  So we need to demand right now Nuremberg 2.0.
[01:50:47.729 --> 01:50:51.153]  These people need to be held accountable and there is a precedent for this.
[01:50:51.213 --> 01:50:52.735]  It's not hyperbolic in nature.
[01:50:53.095 --> 01:51:00.163]  Don't let anybody gaslight you into believing that you're somehow a violent extremist when you suggest that we should be upholding the rule of law.
[01:51:00.584 --> 01:51:08.670]   Military tribunals, if that doesn't work because our military is depleted and full of transgender freak shows, and just compliant sheep who would take the death jab
[01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:10.069]  themselves and we've got nobody left.
[01:51:10.069 --> 01:51:13.869]  Guess what? There are 340 million Americans in this country.
[01:51:13.869 --> 01:51:17.869]   There's a precedent for how we handle these war criminals and people who have been
[01:51:17.869 --> 01:51:21.670]  bleeding people to their deaths prematurely for decades now.
[01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:24.369]  The evidence is here. We have the bioweapon.
[01:51:24.369 --> 01:51:27.170]  We have this Ukrainian debacle that's happening here.
[01:51:27.170 --> 01:51:28.170]  These are a line group.
[01:51:28.170 --> 01:51:30.170]  We are now in World War III.
[01:51:30.170 --> 01:51:34.670]   The globalists are launching it against all of humanity and they plan on only making it intensify.
[01:51:34.631 --> 01:51:36.714]  What do you think the next big shoot-a-drops are?
[01:51:38.368 --> 01:51:40.249]  I mean, I think that we need to hold these people accountable.
[01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:44.252]  The next big shoot-a-drops are going to be more of the Marburg pandemics that you just talked about.
[01:51:44.272 --> 01:51:48.695]  They're going to have to continue the plan that they have found a successful formula in using.
[01:51:49.096 --> 01:52:02.025]  Pandemics, locking people down, depopulating the planet, scaring the hell out of everybody to push them towards the big pharma injections that are bioweapons as per the contract with the DoD who ordered these things up and then launched warfare.
[01:52:02.045 --> 01:52:04.547]  And I'm going to tell you something that you should really be careful about.
[01:52:04.606 --> 01:52:08.926]   So many people, including attorneys and law enforcement individuals, are out here telling
[01:52:08.926 --> 01:52:14.445]  you that our failure of Congress gave immunity to Big Pharma.
[01:52:14.445 --> 01:52:15.445]  That is a farce.
[01:52:15.445 --> 01:52:16.926]  They do not have legal immunity.
[01:52:16.926 --> 01:52:20.206]  There is not one law in the entire state of anywhere.
[01:52:20.224 --> 01:52:21.845]  I mean, what about the FBI?
[01:52:21.865 --> 01:52:23.166]  What about the Justice Department?
[01:52:22.985 --> 01:52:27.725]   has a law that enables anyone or any business to deploy a weapon of
[01:52:27.725 --> 01:52:31.395]  biowarfare or a weapon of mass destruction against innocents.
[01:52:31.395 --> 01:52:34.475]   These people need to be held accountable. Nuremberg too, that's
[01:52:34.475 --> 01:52:37.775]   what we need to call for. We need to call for trials, we need to call for
[01:52:37.775 --> 01:52:41.704]   indictments, these people should be perp-locked and marched out. I totally agree. I
[01:52:41.704 --> 01:52:46.945]   mean what about the FBI? What about the Justice Department? What about the CIA? Most of those
[01:52:46.945 --> 01:52:48.864]  people are compartmentalized.
[01:52:46.957 --> 01:52:48.579]  Can't they see this is a bio-attack?
[01:52:48.599 --> 01:52:56.128]  Can't they see they got their so-called liability protection before they launched it that doesn't protect them from a crime against humanity like this?
[01:52:56.188 --> 01:52:57.690]  I mean, they really did it.
[01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.992]  It's not coming, it's here.
[01:53:00.037 --> 01:53:04.798]  The CIA is the one who instructed the Wuhan lab to do exactly what it is that they did.
[01:53:04.858 --> 01:53:05.999]  They instructed all of this.
[01:53:06.039 --> 01:53:07.279]  They're running cover for all of this.
[01:53:07.299 --> 01:53:21.463]  The FBI is jailing patriots and hunting down grandmas and grandpas who prayed on the Capitol steps on January 6th, rather than investigating the real black crime epidemic here in this country and the criminals that are unleashing a weapon of bio-warfare against us.
[01:53:21.943 --> 01:53:23.964]  By the way, stay right there.
[01:53:23.984 --> 01:53:28.367]  As we use the Nazi historical parallel, we're finally two years before the end of World War II.
[01:53:28.387 --> 01:53:31.209]  The Nazis started trying to get rid of Hitler, but it was too late.
[01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:32.871]  How do we stop World War III?
[01:53:32.911 --> 01:53:33.931]  With Stu Peters, straight ahead.
[01:53:33.751 --> 01:53:37.411]   there is we use the Nazi historical parallel. We're finally two years before
[01:53:37.411 --> 01:53:40.530]   the end of World War II. The Nazis started trying to get rid of Hitler, but it was
[01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:44.411]   too late. How do we stop World War III? With Stu Peters straight ahead. Stay with
[01:53:44.411 --> 01:53:50.051]   us. We're showing footage of the Nuremberg trials in 1946 in Europe of
[01:53:50.051 --> 01:53:53.289]  the Nazis that survived.
[01:53:52.473 --> 01:54:00.360]  Most of them got hung, the top ones, but their top engineers and scientists were brought over here to be servants of the new world order system.
[01:54:01.533 --> 01:54:08.755]  Syndicated talk show host and a smart guy, Stu Peters is here with us and he's been fearless fighting this and exposing it and just cutting to the chase.
[01:54:09.455 --> 01:54:16.757]  It's like if you lived in the Soviet Union or you lived under Fidel Castro or Kim Jong-un in their early days, would you try to stop them?
[01:54:16.817 --> 01:54:18.097]  What would you do to stop them?
[01:54:18.557 --> 01:54:32.022]   I look at all the fools that go along with political correctness in the modern system when it's destroying all of us right in front of our faces and they're openly having MI6 come out and say they want to ban Shakespeare and George Orwell.
[01:54:32.042 --> 01:54:33.964]  I mean, I read that the first hour.
[01:54:34.024 --> 01:54:35.785]  That's mainstream news with a straight face.
[01:54:36.226 --> 01:54:36.787]  Rewriting.
[01:54:39.514 --> 01:54:40.815]  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
[01:54:40.855 --> 01:54:43.957]  I mean, these people want mind control over everybody.
[01:54:43.997 --> 01:54:45.078]  They are degenerate.
[01:54:45.418 --> 01:54:46.479]  They are pedophiles.
[01:54:46.819 --> 01:54:48.280]  You say, well, why are they so bad?
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:48.980]  Look at history.
[01:54:49.221 --> 01:54:54.964]  We go through cycles where really bad people get control, and then even worse people get control, and then worse get control.
[01:54:55.004 --> 01:54:59.567]  That's the cycle of corruption, until they finally run it in the ground and civilization collapses.
[01:54:59.947 --> 01:55:12.928]   And just last week, Stu, I'm sure you saw it, Elon Musk beams into the World Government Summit and says, hey, I want Firewalls, or bulkheads in a ship, so that if one chamber floods, the whole thing doesn't sink.
[01:55:13.388 --> 01:55:15.709]  If one civilization goes down, they don't all go down.
[01:55:15.749 --> 01:55:18.950]  That's one of the biggest arguments against a one-world government, obviously.
[01:55:19.331 --> 01:55:25.373]  Not to mention those running this attempted world government are so psychotic and so anti-human, like Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[01:55:25.393 --> 01:55:31.176]  So I don't see how it's a no-brainer for everybody worldwide to unite against the New World Order.
[01:55:31.436 --> 01:55:33.637]  And the good news is, I'm starting to see some real traction.
[01:55:33.677 --> 01:55:35.579]   I've known Joe Rogan Twenty-five years.
[01:55:35.619 --> 01:55:36.240]  Good friend of mine.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:37.301]  We talk almost every day.
[01:55:37.641 --> 01:55:38.822]  He knows all the stuff I knew.
[01:55:38.842 --> 01:55:40.144]  He's smart as I am or smarter.
[01:55:40.744 --> 01:55:42.146]  He's finally saying, New World Order.
[01:55:42.186 --> 01:55:42.767]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:55:42.787 --> 01:55:43.407]  They're taking over.
[01:55:43.427 --> 01:55:44.448]  They're going to make you eat bugs.
[01:55:44.488 --> 01:55:45.069]  Biometrics.
[01:55:45.349 --> 01:55:45.950]  Four shots.
[01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:48.593]  He did that right after Musk came out last week.
[01:55:48.613 --> 01:55:51.496]  So I'm seeing that courage is contagious.
[01:55:51.576 --> 01:55:53.418]  And CNN's not mainstream media.
[01:55:53.478 --> 01:55:54.479]  Almost no one watches it.
[01:55:54.499 --> 01:55:55.160]  100,000 viewers on average.
[01:55:56.201 --> 01:55:58.724]  But people like Joe Rogan are the mainstream.
[01:55:58.744 --> 01:56:00.305]  The mainstream is what's most popular.
[01:56:00.746 --> 01:56:08.394]  And the fact that the mainstream, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, sound like Stu Peters, sound like Alex Jones, Carlson, you know, says I woke him up 10 years ago.
[01:56:08.674 --> 01:56:09.395]  He's on board.
[01:56:09.535 --> 01:56:13.940]  But we've got to then push that to the masses and then develop a plan to stop this.
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:15.902]  Was it heartening for you to see what Musk said?
[01:56:15.942 --> 01:56:17.584]  And what's your real take on Musk?
[01:56:20.147 --> 01:56:22.550]  I mean, we only have an hour together.
[01:56:23.211 --> 01:56:28.578]  But I will just say, look, I mean, I think everybody really needs to use discernment when it comes to anybody talking about anything.
[01:56:28.618 --> 01:56:30.281]  Look at their fruits, see who they really are.
[01:56:30.341 --> 01:56:34.206]  I mean, Elon Musk apparently is doing some decent things over at Twitter.
[01:56:34.226 --> 01:56:42.031]   I'm allowed back on there at Real Stew Peters, which is Great, because I'm really getting under the feathers of some people who deserve it over on that platform.
[01:56:42.071 --> 01:56:50.074]  But I mean, this is also the guy from Neuralink that wants to put chips in your brain and control your mind and your memory and your dreams and your thoughts and your behavior.
[01:56:50.134 --> 01:56:58.057]  So I don't really know how free speech Elon Musk is, and I'm really kind of taking my time and making a real judgment about that.
[01:56:58.137 --> 01:57:01.619]  But you asked something interesting before the break was how do we stop World War III?
[01:57:02.319 --> 01:57:04.040]  How do we stop the New World Order?
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:14.624]  Yeah, you see Joe Rogan following your lead, following my lead, talking about accountability now because people are finally starting to wake up to the fact that, hey, my media is all owned by the same people.
[01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:21.197]  Why is the Fox News Channel owned predominantly by BlackRock and funded by Vanguard and Big Pharma?
[01:57:21.418 --> 01:57:30.909]  75% of the budget from Pfizer or from Fox is obtained by Pfizer, the people who, you know, developed and helped to unleash the bioweapon on humanity.
[01:57:31.009 --> 01:57:32.371]  And so it's not going to stop.
[01:57:32.451 --> 01:57:34.674]  They're not going to stop until they are stopped.
[01:57:34.833 --> 01:57:38.672]  And so when you asked about what do we do to stop them?
[01:57:38.672 --> 01:57:42.974]   Well, certainly waiting for a man to ride in on a white horse in a fake government
[01:57:42.974 --> 01:57:44.932]  corporate crime syndicate is not gonna work.
[01:57:44.932 --> 01:57:47.533]  We see that they rig elections and they steal elections.
[01:57:47.533 --> 01:57:51.653]   Voting, by all intents and purposes, is 100% fake at the federal level.
[01:57:51.653 --> 01:57:54.934]  States have to start ignoring the federal government.
[01:57:54.934 --> 01:58:00.012]   State executives like Florida's Ron DeSantis actually have to mean what they say
[01:58:00.012 --> 01:58:01.613]  and then take steps to do it.
[01:58:01.868 --> 01:58:15.314]  To the extent that Ron DeSantis is useful in any way is only to the extent that he will seize the bioweapon and then have his attorneys, general law enforcement agencies direct them to go arrest the people who are responsible for deploying the bioweapon on Floridians.
[01:58:15.394 --> 01:58:16.214]  Nobody's doing that.
[01:58:16.937 --> 01:58:25.662]  And so it's going to take us here, Americans, and like you said, citizens around the world, to recognize this is what's happening and then to hold these people accountable.
[01:58:26.203 --> 01:58:46.455]  Anybody that you see in our government, whether it's Marjorie Taylor Greene or Kevin McCarthy advocating for sending money or supporting any war efforts in Ukraine against Russia, against China to defend the Taiwan invasion, none of these countries, Taiwan nor Ukraine, have anything to do with our prosperity, our individual liberty, our freedom, our sovereignty here in this country.
[01:58:46.895 --> 01:58:50.257]  We should immediately have an immigration moratorium.
[01:58:50.277 --> 01:58:54.058]  We should deport every single illegal alien that our law enforcement runs across.
[01:58:54.098 --> 01:58:54.999]  Effective immediately.
[01:58:55.059 --> 01:58:56.219]  Sorry, no exceptions.
[01:58:56.339 --> 01:58:56.899]  Get out.
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.020]  We are at war right now.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:14.547]   And then we need to haul these people in, including those politicians, those fake leaders that I just mentioned, who are all blackmailed and have inflation of bribery with Epstein's client lists and pictures of them, you know, having pedophilia, you know, Depraved behavior with children.
[01:59:15.007 --> 01:59:23.092]  All these people need to be hauled before Nuremberg as well, and that includes any representative of our government that advocates for more money or more weaponry that's going to lead us directly into war.
[01:59:23.112 --> 01:59:25.553]  And that really is the problem, and they need to hear from us.
[01:59:25.673 --> 01:59:26.874]  Take Senator Johnson.
[01:59:27.334 --> 01:59:31.476]  Great guy on vaccines, great guy on the border, but then he's a total warmonger.
[01:59:32.591 --> 01:59:45.484]  Yeah, I don't really know if he's great on the vaccines, the fake vaccine poison bioweapon either, because you know this was kind of a monkey show where he had this self-proclaimed inventor of the mRNA technology there basically dictating the meeting and telling him what to say.
[01:59:45.544 --> 01:59:55.293]   Look, all of these people, every single person that goes before a camera, Any congressional hearing that you see on television you have to assume is part of the Empire of Lies and it's 100% scripted and fake.
[01:59:55.333 --> 01:59:56.274]  This is pro-wrestling.
[01:59:56.554 --> 01:59:58.556]  This is the rigged NFL that we're watching here.
[01:59:58.976 --> 01:59:59.917]  It's all theatrics.
[01:59:59.957 --> 02:00:00.718]  It's all theater.
[02:00:00.778 --> 02:00:04.501]  It's meant to lead you right down to the level of bare-bones subservience.
[02:00:05.061 --> 02:00:06.942]  They are following Agenda 2030.
[02:00:07.003 --> 02:00:08.403]  These people, they've said it to you.
[02:00:08.524 --> 02:00:08.984]  Exactly.
[02:00:09.284 --> 02:00:14.248]  Bill Gates stood before the whole country, before the whole world, and said, how do we take care of this?
[02:00:14.408 --> 02:00:16.369]  I saw the pictures of the Georgia Guidestones earlier.
[02:00:16.389 --> 02:00:18.551]  500 million people should inhabit Earth.
[02:00:18.591 --> 02:00:18.931]  That's it.
[02:00:19.331 --> 02:00:25.936]  The guy that's standing in front of you saying we have an overpopulation problem is also the guy who's the most heavily invested into this vaccine and pandemics.
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:30.800]   Bill Gates, a health expert, what is he doing involved with the medical community?
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:34.800]   Because he's really the head of Planned Parenthood, which is the planned extermination operations,
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.800]  the eugenics board, not just for killing babies.
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.800]   But what I'm saying to you is, I agree with you, we've got to be hardcore because the
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:46.800]   enemy's hardcore, but do you not see it as, I said, how are we doing earlier?
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:47.800]  You said we're getting our asses kicked.
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:53.800]   But, I mean, when the biggest, and Rogan has like 15, 20 million viewers a day, when he
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:58.800]   finally feels safe to go public, that shows that the scales are tipping our way, and it's
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.800]  very, very positive.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.800]  very positive.
[02:01:00.829 --> 02:01:07.410]  And so overall, I agree with you, we're in deep trouble, but at least I'm starting to see some signs of traction.
[02:01:08.091 --> 02:01:09.791]  And I want to supercharge that's what I'm saying.
[02:01:10.785 --> 02:01:13.447]  Yeah, and look, I don't want to black pill anybody.
[02:01:13.768 --> 02:01:15.889]  I'm just trying to accurately depict where we are.
[02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:26.699]  And yes, when you see that information is starting to come out, when you see that more people are becoming Matrix red-pilled, you know, that was a documentary, not a movie, obviously, we need to continue to put the pedal all the way to the floor.
[02:01:26.759 --> 02:01:28.921]  This is the time that we really need to step on the gas.
[02:01:29.321 --> 02:01:30.482]  We can't play politics.
[02:01:30.522 --> 02:01:33.585]  We can't play politically correct with a group of criminals that's trying to kill us.
[02:01:34.025 --> 02:01:42.111]  So yeah, to the extent that Joe Rogan is reaching ostensibly millions of people a day or hundreds of millions, whatever they claim to be reaching, that's fantastic.
[02:01:42.171 --> 02:01:43.853]  Now, what are we going to do with the information?
[02:01:44.393 --> 02:01:45.034]  What are we going to do?
[02:01:45.074 --> 02:01:47.055]  The good news is, and you want to talk about good news?
[02:01:47.075 --> 02:01:47.976]  I'll give you some good news.
[02:01:48.396 --> 02:01:57.203]  The good news is that the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and our Declaration of Independence that were written by our forefathers tell us exactly what to do when tyrants arrive.
[02:01:57.263 --> 02:01:58.264]  And the tyrants are here.
[02:01:58.724 --> 02:02:12.520]  They tell us that in any time that there is an oppressive government that violates or oppresses your inherent God-given inalienable rights that you are to abolish or tear down that form of government and replace it with something that is representative of the people.
[02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:21.766]   Short of doing that, I don't know how anybody expects to continue on the trajectory that we're on right now and actually save a country, much less save humanity.
[02:02:21.807 --> 02:02:24.568]  There are billions of people, 8 billion people on this planet.
[02:02:24.908 --> 02:02:29.471]  I've heard that 5.5 to 7 billion doses of this have gone out to individuals around the world.
[02:02:29.971 --> 02:02:31.452]  This is the biggest kill off.
[02:02:31.472 --> 02:02:39.657]  This is a genocidal level mass killing and there's a lot of work to be done to get these people to the doorstep of accountability and dragged before a Nuremberg tribunal.
[02:02:39.976 --> 02:02:42.577]  and appropriately punished and sentenced.
[02:02:42.577 --> 02:02:46.296]   I totally agree with you and we've come a long way and that they intended to still have
[02:02:46.296 --> 02:02:51.336]   all this rolling out but despite all the censorship and control, talk shows like yours and many
[02:02:51.336 --> 02:02:54.815]   others help push it over the edge and so we're seeing some major victory.
[02:02:54.815 --> 02:02:58.496]   Let's come back to the final segment with Stu Peters to cover the waterfront.
[02:02:58.496 --> 02:03:02.777]   So many great issues, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be discussing with him straight ahead,
[02:03:02.777 --> 02:03:05.056]  Real Stu Peters on Twitter.
[02:03:05.056 --> 02:03:07.136]  And again, I don't think the jury's out on Elon Musk.
[02:03:07.136 --> 02:03:10.096]   I'll tell you what I really think about him when we come back.
[02:03:10.096 --> 02:03:11.416]  Stay with us in full wars.com.
[02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:14.290]  Alright, final segment with Stu Peters.
[02:03:15.935 --> 02:03:17.159]  I'm gonna take your phone calls.
[02:03:18.226 --> 02:03:20.408]  And cover up other breaking news in the next hour.
[02:03:20.468 --> 02:03:21.529]  But this is a real war.
[02:03:21.549 --> 02:03:26.953]  You have to understand that any talk show hosts that are really fighting the globalists, they're going to come after them.
[02:03:27.453 --> 02:03:29.334]  Look at James O'Keefe.
[02:03:29.374 --> 02:03:37.661]  Look at how the board fired him right after the Pfizer coup he had that devastated them and got their head of mRNA admitting it's all a fraud.
[02:03:37.701 --> 02:03:38.742]  They make the viruses.
[02:03:39.142 --> 02:03:40.263]  They release the viruses.
[02:03:40.303 --> 02:03:42.905]  They erase your immune system to keep you sick.
[02:03:43.605 --> 02:03:48.250]  And I know as a normal person you're listening, thinking, that's so evil, that's impossible.
[02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:49.291]  No, look at history.
[02:03:49.931 --> 02:03:51.093]  There are times when this happens.
[02:03:51.173 --> 02:03:55.657]  And so I see this as a very healthy point we're at, where more and more people are getting it.
[02:03:55.817 --> 02:03:57.359]  And I don't say this again to brag.
[02:03:57.839 --> 02:03:59.581]  I say it because the average person is blessed.
[02:03:59.641 --> 02:04:00.462]  You're not prominent.
[02:04:01.643 --> 02:04:03.084]  You have your privacy with the public.
[02:04:03.144 --> 02:04:05.807]  You go out, you don't know how popular liberty is.
[02:04:06.730 --> 02:04:18.898]  But I can tell you, I go all over the country and all over the world, and before I'd walk down the street 20 years ago and maybe 1 out of 100 people would shake my hand, and then 10 years ago it was, you know, 1 out of 10 would be a listener.
[02:04:18.918 --> 02:04:20.299]  And every once in a while I'd run into an enemy.
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:26.684]  And then with Trump, you know, I'd walk down the street and I'd shake 20 hands before somebody said, F you, I want to kill you, Russian agent.
[02:04:27.464 --> 02:04:28.885]  Now, all I get is love.
[02:04:28.945 --> 02:04:29.625]  Knock on wood.
[02:04:29.705 --> 02:04:34.667]  I mean, it is very rare to be screamed at, to have coffee thrown on me, tea thrown on me.
[02:04:34.807 --> 02:04:35.547]  It's happened all the time.
[02:04:35.567 --> 02:04:37.008]  A lot of footage of that you've seen.
[02:04:37.888 --> 02:04:41.409]  All I'm getting is basically love now, even from former leftists.
[02:04:41.429 --> 02:04:46.371]  So it's got to be the election fraud, which we know there's massive evidence of, that's allowing them to stay in.
[02:04:46.391 --> 02:04:51.133]  So you say, well, how do they save themselves when their debt bubble's coming to an end, when the pedophilia's coming out?
[02:04:51.173 --> 02:04:52.053]  Well, they start a war.
[02:04:52.093 --> 02:04:52.974]  They release a new virus.
[02:04:53.274 --> 02:04:54.574]  I think that's what Stu Peters is saying.
[02:04:54.634 --> 02:04:59.274]   We need a real sense of extreme urgency right now.
[02:04:59.274 --> 02:05:03.673]   We're reaching as many people as we can and not go, "Oh, we've kind of backed them off on the
[02:05:03.673 --> 02:05:08.074]   lockdowns and shots." No, we haven't. They're coming back with it.
[02:05:08.074 --> 02:05:14.453]   And the UN is convening emergency meetings saying there's a virus that kills 90 percent of humans, Marburg,
[02:05:14.453 --> 02:05:15.074]  out there.
[02:05:15.769 --> 02:05:19.052]  Now, whether that's hype or not, folks, this is what they want.
[02:05:19.493 --> 02:05:20.894]  This is the control they want.
[02:05:21.415 --> 02:05:22.416]  And that's where we're at.
[02:05:22.436 --> 02:05:26.761]  So Stu, in the eight minutes or so we have left, my friend, you've got a lot of information.
[02:05:26.781 --> 02:05:29.604]  I'm going to give you the floor and hit any other key topics you want to cover.
[02:05:30.746 --> 02:05:33.108]  I mean, you just mentioned the UN and more pandemics.
[02:05:33.148 --> 02:05:34.909]  Who do you think it is that's going to enforce that?
[02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:42.655]  And then along with that, of course, you're going to have people that, you know, claim to be fighting back against, you know, the mandates and the lockdowns and the tyranny.
[02:05:42.755 --> 02:05:43.255]  And you're right.
[02:05:43.295 --> 02:05:44.256]  We can't do that again.
[02:05:44.316 --> 02:05:45.877]  We cannot give these people an inch.
[02:05:45.917 --> 02:05:47.318]  There will be no more lockdowns.
[02:05:47.358 --> 02:05:48.519]  There will be no more shots.
[02:05:48.639 --> 02:05:51.842]  The people that are responsible for that need to be held accountable and brought to justice.
[02:05:52.282 --> 02:05:53.784]  The UN will be enforcing that.
[02:05:54.144 --> 02:05:56.286]  What's left of our military will be enforcing that.
[02:05:56.306 --> 02:06:08.919]  You don't think that there's a military here right now under the control of this illegitimate pedophile in the White House and this fake regime right now that would use a military against its own people to actually fire on its own people to go door-to-door and confiscate firearms?
[02:06:08.939 --> 02:06:10.320]  They're already telling the McCloskeys.
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:10.741]  You saw it.
[02:06:11.181 --> 02:06:17.905]  In the wake of the George Floyd riots, you can't even stand on your front step and defend your own life and liberty and property.
[02:06:17.945 --> 02:06:18.785]  You can't do that.
[02:06:19.145 --> 02:06:22.667]  You're going to be prosecuted and charged and lose your guns and thrown in jail.
[02:06:22.707 --> 02:06:29.831]  Look, the puppeteers that are controlling Biden and China and all of these other people are waging total war on America right now.
[02:06:30.472 --> 02:06:31.152]  I mean, what are they doing?
[02:06:31.172 --> 02:06:33.833]  They're using computers and cyber warfare.
[02:06:34.234 --> 02:06:35.854]  They're smuggling illegal immigrants.
[02:06:35.914 --> 02:06:37.916]  They're manipulating stock markets.
[02:06:37.956 --> 02:06:40.437]  They're influencing the American media.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:50.904]  To use weapons of mass destruction against us, to light trains on fire filled with vinyl chloride that will then go into the Ohio River, responsible for delivering water to 5 million people.
[02:06:51.185 --> 02:06:56.027]  By the way, the largest tributary to the Mississippi River, which delivers water to an unknown amount of people.
[02:06:56.067 --> 02:07:01.069]  I mean, ostensibly 10, 20, 30, 40 million people along the southern part of the Mississippi River.
[02:07:01.449 --> 02:07:03.130]  This is all to destroy America.
[02:07:03.370 --> 02:07:06.832]  And I know you've seen the footage of the train in Ohio.
[02:07:07.512 --> 02:07:28.743]   Going a half mile an hour the tracks are so crooked when the Chinese and Russians and everybody has and the Europe has speed trains that go 300 miles an hour cruising speed can go 400 and then we've got footage of all the dead dove hanging by their feet Off the power lines, falling off dead, miles from the site, as they tell you, it's all safe.
[02:07:28.823 --> 02:07:31.125]  I mean, they are at war with the American people.
[02:07:31.165 --> 02:07:35.227]  Remember, Biden wouldn't even go to Ohio and block federal funding.
[02:07:35.487 --> 02:07:38.189]  I mean, these people are outrageously at war with us.
[02:07:39.775 --> 02:07:53.467]  Wouldn't even go to Ohio, but where did he make his surprise trip to, to write a note to this war criminal, Zelensky, who's running a literal Nazi Azov battalion, committing war crimes, shooting people, trying to flee in the back.
[02:07:53.846 --> 02:07:58.806]   He's got soldiers over there videotaping themselves actually cannibalizing, eating opposition
[02:07:58.806 --> 02:08:00.246]  soldiers and you're right.
[02:08:00.246 --> 02:08:02.105]  They intentionally lit this thing on fire.
[02:08:02.105 --> 02:08:03.105]  This is warfare.
[02:08:03.105 --> 02:08:07.726]   They're using asymmetrical, multidimensional attacks on almost every aspect of our social
[02:08:07.726 --> 02:08:10.606]  lives, of our economic lives, of our political lives.
[02:08:10.606 --> 02:08:13.966]   And you've got to be on the lookout for, you know, limited hangouts.
[02:08:13.966 --> 02:08:15.166]  Unrestricted warfare.
[02:08:15.232 --> 02:08:16.233]  That's what we need to call this.
[02:08:16.353 --> 02:08:18.613]  Unrestricted warfare and it's upon us right now.
[02:08:18.673 --> 02:08:26.175]  That means there's no longer a distinction between what is a battlefield and what is not a battlefield.
[02:08:26.335 --> 02:08:34.737]  Really virtually nothing is safe that we see in our structure right now other than going full core with the speed of urgency like you just said.
[02:08:35.317 --> 02:08:37.557]  We need to move to citizens grand juries.
[02:08:37.637 --> 02:08:43.439]   We need to move to a lawman who says look I'm going to take this evidence I'm going to investigate this crime.
[02:08:43.919 --> 02:08:47.502]  Congressional inquiries, congressional investigations, it's all BS.
[02:08:48.162 --> 02:08:58.588]  When is the last time any of your viewing audience has had a difference made in their lives by a Jim Jordan inquiry or, you know, a Marjorie Taylor Greene impeachment proceeding?
[02:08:58.608 --> 02:09:02.371]  Let me ask you though, what do you think of the Louisiana and Missouri Attorney Generals?
[02:09:03.091 --> 02:09:06.233]  They're going after Big Pharma, they're calling it criminal, they're having depositions.
[02:09:07.717 --> 02:09:16.820]  If Louisiana and Missouri Attorneys General are actually willing to arrest the people that are responsible, then absolutely.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:18.560]  That's what we need to focus on.
[02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:19.501]  Laser focus.
[02:09:19.581 --> 02:09:28.163]  The real method of action here has to be handcuffs, arrests, perp walk, stand trial, become convicted, and then have sentences carried out.
[02:09:28.183 --> 02:09:33.885]  And if that just happened, this whole thing would fall like a house of cards, but the globalists keep doubling down, getting away with more and more.
[02:09:33.905 --> 02:09:36.426]  What's left but World War III and new bio-releases?
[02:09:37.506 --> 02:09:47.951]  How is the mainstream media, how are people like the Fox News Channel, how are these people, who by the way, the Fox News Channel led my own father, despite my fight.
[02:09:48.471 --> 02:09:51.352]  You said this is war for people like us, and you're absolutely right.
[02:09:51.412 --> 02:09:54.554]  I've been watching what you're going through, we've been reporting on it on the Stu Peters Show.
[02:09:54.894 --> 02:09:55.534]  It's horrific.
[02:09:56.118 --> 02:10:03.581]  These people convinced my dad, who by the way knows what his son does for a living, to go and get not only one injection, but two and three.
[02:10:04.101 --> 02:10:09.083]  And then Trump said that they were safe and effective and encouraged people to go get their boosters, said, I got mine, told O'Reilly that.
[02:10:09.683 --> 02:10:20.807]  How are these people still able to sit on the television and talk about a safe and effective vaccine when this one shot in this short period of time is responsible for killing three times as many people as every previous vaccine ever rolled out combined?
[02:10:21.247 --> 02:10:21.767]  How can they do it?
[02:10:21.807 --> 02:10:22.647]  How can they get away with it?
[02:10:22.687 --> 02:10:26.008]  These people are at war with us on absolutely every single front.
[02:10:26.028 --> 02:10:26.789]  I totally agree.
[02:10:27.309 --> 02:10:28.869]  What do you make of James O'Keefe?
[02:10:28.949 --> 02:10:30.650]  I mean, I say Veritas is dead.
[02:10:30.670 --> 02:10:37.112]  I mean, this is so transparent that the FBI is threatening to indict members of Project Veritas if they didn't do this.
[02:10:37.412 --> 02:10:38.232]  This is disgusting.
[02:10:39.286 --> 02:10:58.679]  Yeah, you know, James O'Keefe is Project Veritas, and I will just say that, you know, James O'Keefe, the work that he has done over the years, you know, I mean, the things that he has exposed, we'll salute him if this is the last time that we ever see him, you know, but everybody predicted that this was going to happen to anybody who brings information like what was exposed by Project Veritas.
[02:10:58.699 --> 02:11:07.065]  I mean, anybody knows that if you bring information like this, that impacts the plan of a Gen Ed 2030 or a One World Government, they're going to come after you as hard as they can.
[02:11:09.006 --> 02:11:12.885]   that footage he released three weeks ago I said that's it they're coming after
[02:11:12.885 --> 02:11:17.886]   him I said that's it I mean that Pfizer footage is just incredible. Yeah the
[02:11:17.886 --> 02:11:25.405]   amount of corruption that has yet to be exposed is unthinkable but we have
[02:11:25.405 --> 02:11:30.766]   enough because of the reporting of James O'Keefe because of the reporting of you
[02:11:30.766 --> 02:11:34.126]   know Alex Jones and InfoWars over the years because of the reporting of the
[02:11:34.126 --> 02:11:37.126]  Stu Peters Network and Platform and our show.
[02:11:37.345 --> 02:11:39.627]  We have exposed enough to take action.
[02:11:39.827 --> 02:11:50.997]  And these people, these so-called elected representatives in this fake constitutional republic where there's some sort of an illusion of a, you know, a freedom or individual liberty or even that your vote counts.
[02:11:51.912 --> 02:11:53.273]  Every single one of them knows.
[02:11:53.754 --> 02:11:56.296]  Every one of them has the same information that you do.
[02:11:56.777 --> 02:11:58.238]  Don't let them say that they don't know.
[02:11:58.639 --> 02:12:01.962]  Don't let them gaslight you into believing that they're going to launch an investigation.
[02:12:02.482 --> 02:12:03.563]  The evidence is there.
[02:12:03.683 --> 02:12:04.744]  It's in black and white.
[02:12:04.804 --> 02:12:06.446]  It's written on their own patents.
[02:12:06.486 --> 02:12:08.468]  This is a weapon of bio-warfare.
[02:12:08.868 --> 02:12:11.391]  It was manufactured and deployed against you.
[02:12:11.411 --> 02:12:15.835]  It has killed an unprecedented number of kids, both in the womb and out.
[02:12:16.415 --> 02:12:18.956]  More people are dying suddenly and dropping dead.
[02:12:18.996 --> 02:12:21.618]  And it's all a test to see if they can get away with it.
[02:12:21.958 --> 02:12:24.099]  Tell us about the Died Suddenly film.
[02:12:25.239 --> 02:12:25.919]  Gotta go see it.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:26.680]  Died Suddenly.
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:29.441]  You can find it at the top of StuPeters.com.
[02:12:29.981 --> 02:12:35.804]  There's going to be a Died Suddenly 2 coming out because more and more and more of this continues to happen.
[02:12:36.224 --> 02:12:38.805]  And as long as it's happening, it's our job to continue to expose it.
[02:12:38.845 --> 02:12:39.206]  Absolutely.
[02:12:39.326 --> 02:12:40.646]  Stu Peters, thank you so much.
[02:12:40.706 --> 02:12:41.867]  It's great to have you on the show.
[02:12:42.307 --> 02:12:44.188]  And I look forward to having you back again soon.
[02:12:45.458 --> 02:12:45.958]  I hope you will.
[02:12:45.978 --> 02:12:46.538]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:47.038]  Thank you.
[02:12:47.499 --> 02:12:48.619]  All right, there goes Stu Peters.
[02:12:48.719 --> 02:12:49.039]  Wow.
[02:12:49.599 --> 02:12:51.039]  We got callers that are still holding.
[02:12:51.079 --> 02:12:55.761]  In fact, I'll be able to take more calls than just Mike, Candice, Paul, Ralph, and Tawana.
[02:12:55.801 --> 02:12:58.801]  I'm going to come right to your calls when we come back.
[02:12:58.821 --> 02:12:59.042]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:12:59.062 --> 02:12:59.142]  877-789-2539.
[02:12:59.182 --> 02:13:01.082]  I'm going to host the fourth hour here today.
[02:13:00.902 --> 02:13:06.422]  I'm going to host the fourth hour here today.
[02:13:06.422 --> 02:13:08.701]  A lot of news and information coming up.
[02:13:08.701 --> 02:13:12.021]   But yeah, that was the black pill there, but the black pill will give us the red pill that
[02:13:12.021 --> 02:13:13.501]  will give us the white pill.
[02:13:14.128 --> 02:13:16.750]  We can do it, but we've got to face just how much trouble we're in.
[02:13:17.631 --> 02:13:19.532]  Please remember, we need funds to operate.
[02:13:19.552 --> 02:13:20.853]  We've got great products you already need.
[02:13:20.894 --> 02:13:34.504]  Just make the decision to support the show and see how great our ultimate bone broth is back in stock, or how great our prebiotic is, or how great TurboForce or BrainForce, our nootropics are, or some of the other amazing products like SuperMill Vitality, all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:13:34.924 --> 02:13:36.285]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:13:36.386 --> 02:13:38.386]  Hour number four straight ahead.
[02:13:38.386 --> 02:14:03.386]  Hey, what's up, Bone?
[02:14:03.278 --> 02:14:03.998]  Hey, McBreen.
[02:14:04.198 --> 02:14:05.820]  What's going on, man?
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:09.123]  Hey, really like that work you did on the AI piece.
[02:14:09.323 --> 02:14:10.545]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[02:14:10.625 --> 02:14:11.646]  Right on, I worked hard on that.
[02:14:11.866 --> 02:14:16.670]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[02:14:17.631 --> 02:14:20.514]  Oh, um, no.
[02:14:21.455 --> 02:14:22.176]  No, nothing.
[02:14:22.756 --> 02:14:24.756]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:26.756]  Ummmm...
[02:14:26.756 --> 02:14:30.756]  No.
[02:14:30.756 --> 02:14:32.435]  Hmm. Oh.
[02:14:32.487 --> 02:14:33.467]  Okay.
[02:14:34.188 --> 02:14:34.728]  Thanks anyway.
[02:14:34.908 --> 02:14:35.048]  Yeah.
[02:14:35.068 --> 02:14:38.991]  Good luck with that project, though.
[02:14:41.273 --> 02:14:47.357]  Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:14:47.577 --> 02:14:54.902]  Oh, any way but my way.
[02:14:56.043 --> 02:14:57.424]  Nobody rides for free.
[02:15:00.051 --> 02:15:01.373]  Freedom is not free.
[02:15:01.393 --> 02:15:03.636]  All right, some stations don't carry this first five minutes.
[02:15:03.656 --> 02:15:04.697]  I'm going to cover some news here.
[02:15:04.717 --> 02:15:06.480]  We'll come back from break in six minutes.
[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:08.342]  I'm going right to Tawana.
[02:15:08.943 --> 02:15:13.469]  Everybody else, the order your calls are received on this live Monday broadcast.
[02:15:13.489 --> 02:15:14.390]  We're into the fourth hour.
[02:15:15.071 --> 02:15:17.493]  You know, I have known Roseanne Barr for years.
[02:15:17.734 --> 02:15:20.716]  I have tried to interview her many, many times.
[02:15:21.497 --> 02:15:23.639]  She always says she's going to come on, but she doesn't.
[02:15:23.819 --> 02:15:24.680]  She lives in Hawaii.
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:26.582]  She invited me out to her house in Hawaii.
[02:15:26.602 --> 02:15:29.064]  She invited me out to her house outside Austin.
[02:15:29.104 --> 02:15:29.705]  She's a great lady.
[02:15:29.725 --> 02:15:30.666]  People that I know that know her.
[02:15:31.486 --> 02:15:32.667]  But she definitely has courage.
[02:15:32.687 --> 02:15:34.027]  So I need to go out and meet with her.
[02:15:34.047 --> 02:15:35.248]  I need to go out and interview at her house.
[02:15:35.728 --> 02:15:36.968]  That's probably the best way to get her on.
[02:15:37.008 --> 02:15:39.009]  But I saw some of her new stand-up.
[02:15:39.049 --> 02:15:40.090]  She told me about a month ago.
[02:15:40.190 --> 02:15:43.151]  She said, I'm going to really lay it into him on my new stand-up.
[02:15:43.211 --> 02:15:48.733]  And she told me that she's really getting a good response around the country when she engages in the stand-up.
[02:15:48.773 --> 02:15:50.454]  So it's super hardcore.
[02:15:51.034 --> 02:15:54.156]  And she told me she's mainly only getting love, like 95% positive feedback.
[02:15:55.616 --> 02:15:58.498]  So again, another bellwether that people are waking up.
[02:15:59.038 --> 02:16:06.123]  They think they'll just hit us with a bioweapon and hit us with a poison shot that's ten times worse, and then we'll just kind of forget about it and move on to the next thing and the next attack.
[02:16:06.643 --> 02:16:06.923]  No.
[02:16:07.564 --> 02:16:17.630]  Exposing the attack, hammering the truth, getting the information out there is the lifesaver that we absolutely have to have.
[02:16:19.511 --> 02:16:20.672]  We've got to do it.
[02:16:21.232 --> 02:16:22.573]  We've got to do it now.
[02:16:22.773 --> 02:16:23.694]  It is do or die.
[02:16:25.148 --> 02:16:30.331]  Keep hammering this audience, not because you haven't done a great job, not because you aren't amazing people, but because you're the best we've got.
[02:16:30.411 --> 02:16:31.932]  You're the most awake people in the world.
[02:16:31.952 --> 02:16:34.554]  The globalists don't just hate me, they hate you.
[02:16:36.115 --> 02:16:43.039]  They hate you, and they want to economically destroy you so they can have their criminal way with you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:43.399 --> 02:16:48.162]  And I know most of you know that, but you've got to really let it burn into your head, for those of you that have been on the fence.
[02:16:49.183 --> 02:16:50.864]  Hiding doesn't protect you from this.
[02:16:51.344 --> 02:16:52.965]  Hiding let these people take over.
[02:16:54.838 --> 02:17:00.521]  We have to stop hiding, we have to go public, we have to speak out, and we've got to do it right now.
[02:17:00.841 --> 02:17:02.342]  So here's a clip of Roseanne Barr.
[02:17:03.242 --> 02:17:04.103]  We'll go to break.
[02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:06.824]  We will come back and go directly to your calls.
[02:17:07.985 --> 02:17:09.486]  How many of you's got the backs?
[02:17:13.735 --> 02:17:16.076]  A few of yous, you probably had to get it right.
[02:17:16.276 --> 02:17:17.817]  Were you forced to get the backs?
[02:17:18.237 --> 02:17:18.598]  Yeah.
[02:17:19.078 --> 02:17:22.820]  Boy, what a... That makes me mad they forced people to get the backs.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:26.382]  I hope they have to pay for that, what they did to us.
[02:17:27.042 --> 02:17:35.527]  Did you get any of that myocarditis or the facial paralysis or, you know, the adult dropping dead syndrome or any of that sh**?
[02:17:35.687 --> 02:17:36.487]  Did any of that?
[02:17:37.348 --> 02:17:38.989]  What happened to people?
[02:17:40.154 --> 02:17:46.460]  That they start believing, for some reason, that this government had their best interest at heart?
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.642]  Ha ha ha!
[02:17:48.082 --> 02:17:52.947]  Ha ha ha!
[02:17:53.027 --> 02:17:58.593]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:17:58.933 --> 02:18:00.514]  What?
[02:18:00.575 --> 02:18:00.795]  What?
[02:18:04.685 --> 02:18:14.513]  My whole family's a bunch of libtards, you know, as I said, and they always called me a conspiracy theorist the whole time, but everything I said turned out to be true.
[02:18:14.873 --> 02:18:16.294]  Did they apologize?
[02:18:16.674 --> 02:18:17.855]  Hell no!
[02:18:20.017 --> 02:18:21.358]  They never apologize.
[02:18:23.039 --> 02:18:24.521]  They never admit they're wrong, do they?
[02:18:25.081 --> 02:18:29.665]  Now, my whole family is sick, what, with blood clots and this and that and the other.
[02:18:29.725 --> 02:18:30.705]  They're all sick.
[02:18:30.785 --> 02:18:32.307]  I'm the only healthy one.
[02:18:33.592 --> 02:18:35.592]  I'm gonna miss 'em.
[02:18:35.592 --> 02:18:37.592]  [laughter]
[02:18:37.592 --> 02:18:39.592]  [applause]
[02:18:39.592 --> 02:18:41.592]  [laughter]
[02:18:41.592 --> 02:19:08.054]   What happened to people that are How can they line up to take these shots from this government, knowing that this government gave smallpox-infested blankets to the First Nations people, gave syphilis to black prisoners in Tuskegee, told us there was weapons of mass destruction before they leveled Iraq and destroyed Libya,
[02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:12.957]  That people died.
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:17.980]  What happened?
[02:19:18.821 --> 02:19:21.523]  They're like, hey, can I get that booster?
[02:19:21.863 --> 02:19:25.045]  Can I get that shot in those 15 boosters?
[02:19:25.325 --> 02:19:30.389]  Would you mind giving my daughter here that shot right in her eyeball after she's born?
[02:19:30.749 --> 02:19:33.030]  Could you give her 10 of those right in the eyeball?
[02:19:33.351 --> 02:19:36.573]  Could you give her a shot right in her little baby clitoris?
[02:19:36.633 --> 02:19:39.375]  Could you do that for me, Mr. Biden?
[02:19:39.795 --> 02:19:41.136]  What's wrong with people?
[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:49.263]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:19:49.323 --> 02:19:52.925]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:19:53.105 --> 02:19:55.447]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:19:55.487 --> 02:19:57.248]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:19:57.889 --> 02:20:00.470]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:20:01.271 --> 02:20:05.514]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:20:05.694 --> 02:20:08.896]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:20:09.096 --> 02:20:13.039]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold floor.
[02:20:13.139 --> 02:20:14.760]  It was almost as if it were a plan.
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:20.921]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[02:20:20.981 --> 02:20:23.082]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:20:23.122 --> 02:20:24.702]  They are nothing but distractions.
[02:20:24.762 --> 02:20:27.723]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:20:27.803 --> 02:20:29.383]  You silenced those voices.
[02:20:29.443 --> 02:20:33.164]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:20:33.204 --> 02:20:39.565]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:44.993]  All right, thanks for holding callers.
[02:20:45.013 --> 02:20:45.975]  We're into hour number four.
[02:20:45.995 --> 02:20:47.498]  I'll try to move quickly through your calls.
[02:20:48.179 --> 02:20:51.586]  Tawana in Tennessee on Biden-Ukraine versus our own country.
[02:20:51.947 --> 02:20:52.287]  Welcome.
[02:20:53.618 --> 02:20:54.419]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:20:54.819 --> 02:21:11.673]  Hey, I could go on for a month and not talk about everything I've wanted to talk to you about over the past 20 years, but let me just say I'm hopped up on fizzy magnesium today, and I wanted to just give Biden and Zelensky some great greetings for a wonderful President's Day as they spend the day together.
[02:21:11.753 --> 02:21:13.214]  I'm so happy for them.
[02:21:13.494 --> 02:21:15.036]  They're a match made in heaven.
[02:21:15.536 --> 02:21:24.920]   But Alex, what's most important is we haven't talked about the CBDC pilot program in and February for over a week now because we have so many other
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:29.739]   places that they've got spinning that our minds are just racing like crazy and
[02:21:29.739 --> 02:21:33.640]   I'm telling you Alex I think this CBDC I think that that's the final nail
[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:38.000]   in the coffin and I think that's the central bank digital currencies and as
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:44.480]   you notice that in the town in Palestine yes sir they they ten days before if I
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.560]   come in to cover this Sunday guys reprinted for me I think it's even in the stack
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:54.360]   but I can't find it they FEMA handed out wristbands for an emergency pilot
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:22:00.761]   program to the locals and came door-to-door ten days before the train blew
[02:22:00.761 --> 02:22:02.122]   up Before they let it on fire.
[02:22:02.182 --> 02:22:03.283]  I mean, can you believe that?
[02:22:03.843 --> 02:22:04.883]  What the hell's going on here?
[02:22:04.903 --> 02:22:06.123]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[02:22:06.163 --> 02:22:07.044]  We're one step away.
[02:22:07.464 --> 02:22:08.544]  One step away, Alex.
[02:22:08.584 --> 02:22:09.804]  We're one step away.
[02:22:10.004 --> 02:22:11.665]  And this is the crescendo.
[02:22:11.985 --> 02:22:13.725]  And we've got to start having solutions.
[02:22:13.765 --> 02:22:14.865]  You've got to look local.
[02:22:14.885 --> 02:22:16.446]  You've got to look for your community.
[02:22:16.486 --> 02:22:17.646]  Look for your tribe.
[02:22:18.026 --> 02:22:20.587]  And work around how we're going to do this.
[02:22:20.707 --> 02:22:21.847]  We've got to work around this.
[02:22:21.947 --> 02:22:23.467]  We are the warriors, Alex.
[02:22:23.808 --> 02:22:25.508]  Can I let out a primal scream?
[02:22:25.347 --> 02:22:27.027]  because I've been waiting 20 years.
[02:22:27.027 --> 02:22:29.347]  (screaming)
[02:22:29.347 --> 02:22:32.347]  World honor!
[02:22:32.347 --> 02:22:34.766]  Let me see your war face.
[02:22:34.954 --> 02:22:37.735]  Oh, Alex, man, I love you.
[02:22:37.795 --> 02:22:38.675]  God bless you.
[02:22:38.715 --> 02:22:40.656]  God bless all the Info Warriors.
[02:22:40.776 --> 02:22:45.618]  Everybody, please keep on supporting Alex so that we can continue to fight!
[02:22:45.879 --> 02:22:47.539]  I love it, and it's that, so don't hang up.
[02:22:47.579 --> 02:22:48.860]  That's a primal spirit, Tawana.
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:51.801]  I interrupted your primal scream with mine.
[02:22:52.241 --> 02:22:53.962]  Let me hear your war growl.
[02:22:53.982 --> 02:22:57.384]  Death to the New World Order!
[02:22:57.243 --> 02:22:58.823]  Order!
[02:22:58.823 --> 02:23:01.142]  (screaming)
[02:23:01.142 --> 02:23:01.983]  Oh yeah!
[02:23:01.983 --> 02:23:03.922]  Yeah baby!
[02:23:03.922 --> 02:23:06.162]  (laughing)
[02:23:06.146 --> 02:23:06.787]  Love you.
[02:23:06.807 --> 02:23:07.627]  I appreciate your call.
[02:23:07.687 --> 02:23:08.348]  Amazing points.
[02:23:08.988 --> 02:23:09.268]  Wow.
[02:23:10.149 --> 02:23:11.269]  Ralph in Mississippi.
[02:23:11.289 --> 02:23:12.790]  It'd be hard to follow that up.
[02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:13.511]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:18.995]  Okay, I've got some info to pass on to you about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
[02:23:19.155 --> 02:23:19.455]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:20.836 --> 02:23:35.146]   Monkey Works U.S., that's spelled W-E-R-X, on 2-10-23, this Friday a week ago, broadcast coverage of the actual Flight to flight line of the plane that flew from the U.S.
[02:23:35.647 --> 02:23:49.698]  to Iceland to fuel up all the way to the Baltic Sea, did a one-hour refuel, marked a spot in the Baltic Sea, flew out, returned back on a bombing run, dropped down, unloaded weapons, pulled back up to flight height, and took back off to the ocean.
[02:23:50.579 --> 02:23:53.782]  And he's got the actual coverage of, shows you exactly what happened and when.
[02:23:54.142 --> 02:23:55.383]  That's when the pipelines went up.
[02:23:55.794 --> 02:23:58.096]  I know Sy Hersh has done a great job documenting all that.
[02:23:58.116 --> 02:24:04.200]  He documented what people want and believe.
[02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:07.322]  Monkey Works shows you exactly what happened.
[02:24:08.623 --> 02:24:09.903]  There's no question about it.
[02:24:10.204 --> 02:24:12.585]  We sent a P-8 over there.
[02:24:13.226 --> 02:24:15.267]  Dropped, most likely, Hawk missiles.
[02:24:15.632 --> 02:24:17.994]  Took out all the pipelines and hauled back to the U.S.
[02:24:18.434 --> 02:24:19.876]  Nobody knew that flight was there.
[02:24:20.236 --> 02:24:22.077]  Is that surface to sea?
[02:24:22.097 --> 02:24:23.058]  Does that go underwater?
[02:24:23.399 --> 02:24:26.761]  Apparently, this is the newest version of stuff they've got.
[02:24:27.202 --> 02:24:28.543]  And that's apparently what they use.
[02:24:29.243 --> 02:24:33.443]   all monkey work shows if he shows the exact flight coming over shows it
[02:24:33.443 --> 02:24:37.702]   circling around for one hour refuel shows it marking a spot in the Baltic
[02:24:37.702 --> 02:24:42.602]   going out 50 miles making a u-turn coming back dropping down to bombing
[02:24:42.602 --> 02:24:47.542]   level unloading weapons plane jumps up in the air levels it back off the flight
[02:24:47.542 --> 02:24:51.023]   height and hauls back out. I'll check it out you know I have a lot of respect for
[02:24:51.023 --> 02:24:54.683]   Cy Hirsch when I first saw what happened months before he came out with his report they had a
[02:24:54.683 --> 02:24:59.483]   big NATO drill right over the pipeline area and they said they trained other
[02:24:59.483 --> 02:25:04.722]   Navy divers so it wouldn't be Navy SEALs or who report back to Congress and that
[02:25:04.722 --> 02:25:08.922]   they would use a remote detonators so that whoever delivered the weapons
[02:25:08.922 --> 02:25:14.002]   payload wouldn't be over the target when it happened because of all the systems
[02:25:14.002 --> 02:25:17.002]  that document who's where.
[02:25:15.595 --> 02:25:21.314]   But regardless, Biden said he was going to blow it up, so did April Gillespie and all
[02:25:21.314 --> 02:25:22.314]  the rest of them.
[02:25:22.314 --> 02:25:24.595]  April Gillespie, whatever her name is.
[02:25:24.595 --> 02:25:26.875]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[02:25:26.875 --> 02:25:28.235]  Not disagreeing with you, we should just look into it.
[02:25:28.235 --> 02:25:30.755]  I'll look into it, okay?
[02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:32.595]  Candace in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[02:25:32.595 --> 02:25:33.595]  Go ahead.
[02:25:33.595 --> 02:25:34.595]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:34.595 --> 02:25:36.995]  Hey, great to be talking to you today.
[02:25:36.995 --> 02:25:41.555]  I'm president today, and it's Black Ops History Month.
[02:25:41.555 --> 02:25:47.155]   We are currently in psychological, financial, biological warfare.
[02:25:47.185 --> 02:25:49.066]  It's already been going on.
[02:25:49.366 --> 02:25:54.808]  Me specifically, I called about seven, eight months ago to tell you I've been surviving humiliation rituals.
[02:25:54.868 --> 02:25:56.909]  I'm a satanic ritual survivor.
[02:25:57.530 --> 02:26:04.193]  I got the IBM book that said basically what's all rolling out now was pre-planned in the 70s.
[02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:11.819]   I talked about that with you and I called in to Harrison's show about this Adventures of Tomorrow book and they looked it up.
[02:26:12.719 --> 02:26:16.440]  It's about $1,000 what it's priced at online.
[02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:23.002]  And I live in the Middle Tennessee area in Cheatham County and you've talked about these sex operatives.
[02:26:23.542 --> 02:26:29.304]  I've been being stalked for an extremely long time by FBI.
[02:26:29.844 --> 02:26:33.405]  A local law enforcement in Cheatham County said that they weren't the ones stalking me.
[02:26:33.425 --> 02:26:34.425]  It's the big government.
[02:26:34.972 --> 02:26:39.396]  I've been complaining so much that they sent me a letter saying, uh, don't call us.
[02:26:39.436 --> 02:26:40.616]  You're wasting our resources.
[02:26:40.657 --> 02:26:41.717]  This is the FBI.
[02:26:41.797 --> 02:26:47.362]  I have all of this information on the very first day of this year, January 1st.
[02:26:47.482 --> 02:26:49.904]  Well, ma'am, there's no doubt that we're all being surveilled.
[02:26:49.924 --> 02:26:51.985]  There's all sorts of criminal activity going on.
[02:26:52.005 --> 02:26:53.406]  I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.
[02:26:54.307 --> 02:26:57.590]  Speaking of books that predict all this, uh, we're going to grab the clip.
[02:26:57.610 --> 02:26:58.531]  I'll have it next segment.
[02:26:58.611 --> 02:27:03.875]  On Saturday's show, Jay Dyer talked about a Arthur C. Clarke book I hadn't read.
[02:27:04.455 --> 02:27:05.055]  Alex, first time, long time.
[02:27:05.115 --> 02:27:10.418]  Hey, so I just wanted to talk about something that Stu Peters just mentioned.
[02:27:10.438 --> 02:27:12.419]  So he was talking about unrestricted warfare.
[02:27:12.238 --> 02:27:13.917]  I'll actually show you the book when we come back.
[02:27:13.917 --> 02:27:14.918]  It's pretty amazing.
[02:27:14.918 --> 02:27:15.918]  Thank you for the call.
[02:27:15.918 --> 02:27:18.917]  Paul in Maine, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:27:18.917 --> 02:27:21.518]  Alex, first time, long time.
[02:27:21.518 --> 02:27:28.118]   Hey, so I just wanted to talk about something that Stu Peters just mentioned.
[02:27:28.118 --> 02:27:32.038]  So he was talking about unrestricted warfare.
[02:27:32.038 --> 02:27:35.238]  So some people call that fifth generation warfare, right?
[02:27:35.222 --> 02:27:38.263]  I call it full spectrum dominance.
[02:27:39.224 --> 02:27:40.484]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:27:40.544 --> 02:27:47.648]  So, the thing I worry about when we get into this kind of talk about, you know, resistance is some people are going to get the wrong idea.
[02:27:47.748 --> 02:27:50.990]  Obviously, they're going to start thinking, you know, old school.
[02:27:51.010 --> 02:27:52.991]  They're going to start thinking old ways of fighting.
[02:27:53.411 --> 02:28:04.374]   But I just kind of really want to drill into people that, you know, trying to fight This level of tyranny and corruption in this age of information warfare, it's like trying to storm a World War I machine gun.
[02:28:04.414 --> 02:28:06.836]  Yeah, no, the average cop or FBI agent is just compartmentalized.
[02:28:06.856 --> 02:28:08.497]  They're not the enemy, they're under attack as well.
[02:28:08.857 --> 02:28:15.202]  You beat it by decompartmentalizing people so they see the big picture, like Elon Musk did when he confronted the world government last week.
[02:28:15.602 --> 02:28:19.481]   That's how you get victory is exposing that it's a tiny group at the top orchestrating
[02:28:19.481 --> 02:28:20.842]  this and they're the enemy.
[02:28:20.842 --> 02:28:24.682]   And then you just simply expose them where they're the most hated people on earth and
[02:28:24.682 --> 02:28:28.222]   any policy they push, everybody turns against and then you have victory.
[02:28:28.222 --> 02:28:32.402]   They need to get full spectrum dominance over our bodies and over our resources first to
[02:28:32.402 --> 02:28:33.820]  ralt the rest of their plan.
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:38.161]   But now because we've got the jump on them, I believe they're going to fail.
[02:28:38.285 --> 02:28:42.427]  I just wanted to say that, you know, what's the next level after fifth generation warfare?
[02:28:42.447 --> 02:28:43.468]  That's going to be sixth, right?
[02:28:43.488 --> 02:28:43.928]  What is that?
[02:28:44.268 --> 02:28:46.910]  The levels of warfare have been getting finer and subtler as we go along.
[02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:48.270]  Hold on, I don't want to cut you off, Paul.
[02:28:48.290 --> 02:28:50.232]  Tell us what you think, because I'm a smart guy.
[02:28:50.752 --> 02:28:52.013]  Sixth generational warfare is?
[02:28:53.233 --> 02:28:56.014]  But I mean, Fifth Generation is basically full spectrum, so it's just another level of that.
[02:28:56.274 --> 02:28:59.994]  We'll come right back with Paul to finish up his great points, and then we'll go to everybody else that's holding.
[02:29:00.335 --> 02:29:01.315]  We can't take any more calls.
[02:29:01.395 --> 02:29:02.455]  No more calls on the board, guys.
[02:29:02.475 --> 02:29:03.195]  Just the ones we got here.
[02:29:03.215 --> 02:29:03.795]  This is plenty.
[02:29:04.235 --> 02:29:10.096]  This is 11 phone calls, and I'm going to jam every single one of you in here before this transmission ends.
[02:29:10.136 --> 02:29:12.777]  And then, in 45 minutes from now, you know what that means.
[02:29:13.337 --> 02:29:17.958]  Owen, the Cuck Slayer, the Cuck Destroyer, hosts the War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:29:17.998 --> 02:29:18.398]  Central.
[02:29:18.458 --> 02:29:19.138]  Band out video.
[02:29:19.398 --> 02:29:21.819]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:29:22.879 --> 02:29:36.644]  What we're showing on screen for TV viewers is a CIA advertisement online for young people to join the CIA and spy on the American people.
[02:29:37.585 --> 02:29:39.545]  Skeletons, ghosts, demons, witches.
[02:29:42.226 --> 02:29:47.068]  This is just a bunch of whacked out criminals that have done what other people have done throughout history.
[02:29:47.168 --> 02:29:51.170]  Government gets control, it sets up a cult, and it decides to feed on the rest of the people.
[02:29:52.321 --> 02:29:53.665]  It always collapses civilization.
[02:29:54.588 --> 02:29:57.978]  The same disease that's killed so many civilizations and peoples, we now have.
[02:29:59.448 --> 02:30:11.176]  Paul in Maine, yeah, not shopping at the box stores when you can, supporting independent local business, supporting local farmers, having your own energy systems, being self-sufficient is really how you checkmate these people.
[02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:21.162]  And as things get worse and worse, as the globalists turn off the energy and the food supplies and everything to force you to take the shots, it'll become evident to everybody else that that's really the answer.
[02:30:21.503 --> 02:30:24.865]  But you were going to get into 5th generational warfare, 6th generational warfare, go ahead.
[02:30:26.007 --> 02:30:30.813]  Yeah, so, you know, you think about it, if you want to defeat an enemy, you have to be one step ahead.
[02:30:30.873 --> 02:30:34.939]  You have to reach the next plane of warfare before they do, you know, if you're evenly matched.
[02:30:35.629 --> 02:30:40.651]  So, you know, as I said, the levels of warfare have been getting subtler and finer over time.
[02:30:40.671 --> 02:30:45.033]  We went from bashing each other's skulls in with rocks all the way up to information warfare in the mind.
[02:30:46.093 --> 02:30:54.476]  But I really do believe, and this is going to sound like total foolishness if you are totally anchored to the physical world, but spiritual warfare is the next level of warfare.
[02:30:55.016 --> 02:30:58.037]  And some would argue it's always been the one level of warfare.
[02:30:58.057 --> 02:31:04.500]  You know, purification of your thoughts, purification of your actions, you know, real deep soul searching.
[02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:11.990]   Really heartily recommend fasting to really Um, you know, connect spiritually and cleanse yourself.
[02:31:12.671 --> 02:31:20.678]  Um, there's all sorts of unseen, you know, there's all sorts of, uh, unseen worlds around us that, uh, they echo what happens here, right?
[02:31:21.238 --> 02:31:23.140]  So I really do believe that.
[02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:27.103]  Well, by the way, I said what's above fifth generational because it's attacking everything.
[02:31:27.123 --> 02:31:32.148]  And I was wondering what you're going to say, but no, the first level and the last level and all the levels is spiritual.
[02:31:32.588 --> 02:31:34.050]  It all comes down to our souls.
[02:31:34.090 --> 02:31:34.770]  That's what this is all about.
[02:31:34.810 --> 02:31:35.311]  I totally agree.
[02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:37.270]  Absolutely.
[02:31:37.911 --> 02:31:47.097]  And like I said, it sounds like complete foolishness to people who are still stuck in rifles and bombs mode because they're just still too anchored to the physical.
[02:31:47.117 --> 02:31:47.617]  No, I hear you.
[02:31:47.657 --> 02:31:48.398]  Great point, Paul.
[02:31:48.418 --> 02:31:48.898]  Call again.
[02:31:48.958 --> 02:31:49.318]  Thank you.
[02:31:49.379 --> 02:31:50.459]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:31:50.479 --> 02:31:59.585]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about I just went on a cruise recently and I wore your Alex Jones was right shirt.
[02:32:00.726 --> 02:32:06.270]  And it was just like one of the most magical experiences I've ever had ever.
[02:32:07.679 --> 02:32:08.199]  What happened?
[02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:08.980]  Tell folks about it.
[02:32:11.161 --> 02:32:14.684]  Most of the people were Canadians that approached me.
[02:32:15.684 --> 02:32:24.370]  One lady was from New York and her son got myocarditis after getting a shot and she didn't know who you were.
[02:32:24.770 --> 02:32:25.531]  So she asked me.
[02:32:25.551 --> 02:32:29.853]  She sat down at the bar next to me and she was like, well who's Alex Jones?
[02:32:29.973 --> 02:32:31.755]  Like, what was he right about?
[02:32:31.795 --> 02:32:33.736]  And I was like, well, where should I start?
[02:32:36.119 --> 02:32:43.526]  And then we just had like a three-hour conversation and I'm pretty sure she was very red-pilled afterwards.
[02:32:44.787 --> 02:32:54.876]  Even her husband was like, I work a union job so I can't say that I listened to Alex Jones but you should pay attention to what this guy's saying.
[02:32:55.217 --> 02:32:57.479]  Wow, so she didn't know who I was but her husband did?
[02:32:58.394 --> 02:33:02.395]  Our husband did, but he was, you know, those unions are... Just amazing.
[02:33:02.416 --> 02:33:05.076]  The Canadians were just like, you know, oh yeah, great.
[02:33:04.895 --> 02:33:05.895]  as you get?
[02:33:05.895 --> 02:33:06.895]  Just amazing.
[02:33:06.895 --> 02:33:12.774]  The Canadians were just like, you know, "Oh yeah, great."
[02:33:12.774 --> 02:33:16.174]  You know, they'd give me like a high five or whatever.
[02:33:16.148 --> 02:33:20.210]  That's what I'm telling folks, is Liberty is so popular, but we're all isolated individuals.
[02:33:20.250 --> 02:33:20.991]  We don't know it.
[02:33:21.611 --> 02:33:23.813]  Now, you get a hundred to one love.
[02:33:23.833 --> 02:33:26.114]  You might also get a beer bottle over your head wearing it, too.
[02:33:26.134 --> 02:33:26.715]  So be careful.
[02:33:26.735 --> 02:33:28.776]  I was afraid I was going to get thrown over the boat.
[02:33:32.118 --> 02:33:37.262]  But I really want to promote your Red Real, the Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:33:37.562 --> 02:33:38.162]  Oh, my God.
[02:33:38.463 --> 02:33:42.005]  That thing is just blowing my mind how good it is.
[02:33:42.525 --> 02:33:43.326]  What did it do for you?
[02:33:43.346 --> 02:33:44.647]  What did Real Red Pill do when you took it?
[02:33:45.649 --> 02:34:00.658]  Well I have fibromyalgia and it's made my pain be reduced by probably 50% and I have energy to like do things you know or normally like it was like oh god I gotta like do my laundry or whatever.
[02:34:00.938 --> 02:34:01.118]  No.
[02:34:02.179 --> 02:34:10.207]   This stuff and that and the Brain Force Ultra are both of those products for me have been Transformational.
[02:34:10.226 --> 02:34:15.105]   Well the thing about Real Red Pill Plus is it's got some natural healthy stimulant in
[02:34:15.105 --> 02:34:16.506]  it but that's not what does it.
[02:34:16.506 --> 02:34:18.866]  It's the preglanone and the other trace elements.
[02:34:18.866 --> 02:34:21.426]  The preglanone is the basis of all your hormones.
[02:34:21.426 --> 02:34:24.145]   With all the hormones that are in the food and water it blocks the preglanone is what
[02:34:24.145 --> 02:34:26.065]  scientists and doctors have told me.
[02:34:26.065 --> 02:34:29.945]   And so when you take preglanone, especially if you're over 30 or 40, then it helps the
[02:34:29.945 --> 02:34:31.346]  building blocks of your natural hormones.
[02:34:31.346 --> 02:34:34.186]  So it gives you long, healthy, sustained energy.
[02:34:34.361 --> 02:34:38.262]  So people should get Real Red Pill Plus at InfowarStore.com.
[02:34:38.582 --> 02:34:40.563]  God bless you, and I really appreciate you calling.
[02:34:40.623 --> 02:34:41.383]  Mike from Illinois.
[02:34:41.784 --> 02:34:43.124]  And again, thank you for your support, sir.
[02:34:43.164 --> 02:34:44.905]  We would not be here without you.
[02:34:45.365 --> 02:34:50.587]  And we are finally getting some of the t-shirts back in stock, so check them out at InfowarStore.com.
[02:34:50.907 --> 02:34:53.368]  And we will be right back with another caller.
[02:34:53.848 --> 02:34:56.229]  And then we'll come right back after a break and take more calls.
[02:34:57.225 --> 02:34:57.585]  All right.
[02:34:58.246 --> 02:34:59.507]  Five star review right there.
[02:35:00.147 --> 02:35:01.928]  Let's talk to Leo in Minnesota.
[02:35:01.948 --> 02:35:02.749]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:35:04.310 --> 02:35:05.390]  What's going on, Alex?
[02:35:05.430 --> 02:35:06.311]  How you doing, brother?
[02:35:06.491 --> 02:35:08.132]  I'm trying, trying, brother, as hard as I can.
[02:35:08.192 --> 02:35:08.853]  It's getting crazy.
[02:35:09.913 --> 02:35:10.514]  Yeah, man.
[02:35:10.554 --> 02:35:14.536]  Well, man, just wanted to give a shout out to all of my proud boys nationwide.
[02:35:15.037 --> 02:35:15.797]  Hold in tight.
[02:35:16.337 --> 02:35:19.559]  And a little update on the January 6th political prisoners.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:28.850]   We had a boy named Ryan Samsoe, who's been in contact with the Gateway Pundit, and now he's Already been assaulted three times.
[02:35:29.471 --> 02:35:33.354]  Keep in mind, this guy hasn't even been tried and he's been held for two years now.
[02:35:33.934 --> 02:35:43.721]  He's already been beaten, hogtied, abused, tied to a chair for 12 hours, denied his medical treatment... One guy had his one guy... One guy the jail guards beat his eye out.
[02:35:44.842 --> 02:35:46.183]  And that's who I'm talking about now.
[02:35:46.223 --> 02:35:47.684]  He has no vision in his eye.
[02:35:48.263 --> 02:35:56.929]  And he's even lost his phone privileges for six months, so now he can't even speak to the Gateway Pundit to talk about what he needs to talk about to shine a light on his situation.
[02:35:56.949 --> 02:35:58.611]  And that's political persecution.
[02:35:58.651 --> 02:35:59.611]  He's a political prisoner.
[02:35:59.631 --> 02:36:00.372]  We should pray for him.
[02:36:01.383 --> 02:36:12.792]  He is a political prisoner, and I just want to shout out to Rufio, shout out to Rambo Biggs, shout out to Enrique, shout out to all my boys who are in there over the January 6th PSYOP.
[02:36:13.132 --> 02:36:14.333]  Just hold in tight, boys.
[02:36:14.373 --> 02:36:15.594]  We're shining a light on this.
[02:36:15.994 --> 02:36:33.794]   And to all my proud boys nationwide, it might seem like we've been swept under a rug because Biden's in office, but I tell you that the fire in our souls is burning brighter than ever, and we see right through the PSYOPs, and trust me, We're here to support this country and when it all goes to shit, you look for those black and yellow colors and we'll support you.
[02:36:34.675 --> 02:36:36.916]  Why don't you say a brief prayer for the fellow you just mentioned?
[02:36:39.338 --> 02:36:52.226]  Dear Lord, we bow our heads and we come together in your presence to ask that you watch over our brothers who have been tried as political prisoners just for expressing their patriotic rights.
[02:36:52.751 --> 02:37:00.333]  And I would ask that you lay something on Trump's heart as well and his soul to make him speak out more and raise more awareness to this situation.
[02:37:00.813 --> 02:37:08.396]  Lord, we know we're only fighting for a battle that's going to be won for you ultimately, but it's a dark road.
[02:37:08.916 --> 02:37:14.317]  And I just pray you keep eyes on everybody and pray that these guys make it out of these jail cells alive.
[02:37:14.817 --> 02:37:15.158]  Amen.
[02:37:15.198 --> 02:37:16.398]  Thank you so much for the call, brother.
[02:37:17.178 --> 02:37:17.518]  All right.
[02:37:17.638 --> 02:37:19.439]  We're going to come right back and move quickly.
[02:37:20.413 --> 02:37:26.368]  James, Ivan, Connor, Mike, Joe, Jeremiah, Stephanie, because...
[02:37:27.674 --> 02:37:37.762]  I've got to air, I need to air, a special piece at the end of the hour that is a clarification on something that's important.
[02:37:38.222 --> 02:37:41.705]  And the war room's coming up, so we've only got limited time here coming up.
[02:37:41.945 --> 02:37:44.868]  But I'm going to get to all your calls on the other side of this break.
[02:37:44.928 --> 02:37:48.010]  Yeah, they are just torturing the hell out of those people, folks.
[02:37:48.791 --> 02:37:50.432]  And they're a beta test for all of us.
[02:37:51.053 --> 02:37:53.354]  It's Joe Biggs today, and it's all of us tomorrow.
[02:37:53.374 --> 02:37:53.875]  We'll be right back.
[02:37:55.177 --> 02:37:56.657]  All right, let's race through your phone calls.
[02:37:56.737 --> 02:37:58.738]  James in Ohio, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:37:58.778 --> 02:37:59.138]  Go ahead.
[02:38:01.198 --> 02:38:06.079]  Hi, I think Elon Musk is being positioned to be the kind of new Alex Jones.
[02:38:06.499 --> 02:38:19.322]  He has the public support, has the millennial support and Gen Z support because of his involvement in crypto, and also owns now an entire media, social media operation, which is how the younger generation communicates.
[02:38:19.362 --> 02:38:25.784]   He's involved in Starlink, Brainship, Everything under the sun and he's trying to be positioned as kind of a new Alex Jones.
[02:38:26.484 --> 02:38:31.485]  Additionally, I wanted to say the nascent iodine you guys sell is life-changing.
[02:38:32.306 --> 02:38:40.047]  One thing I run into is I forget to re-buy it, so I'll be out of it and then, you know, I'll listen to you when I drive or when I'm at work.
[02:38:40.387 --> 02:38:48.109]  So I forget to go on Infowars stores and order it, but I figured out I can do 60 days auto-ship or 90 days auto-ship, so I encourage everybody to do that.
[02:38:49.090 --> 02:38:57.507]   And hey, my cousin Mike, His birthday's coming up, and I was wondering if I could get Felix the Fentanyl Dragon to wish Mike a happy birthday.
[02:38:59.068 --> 02:39:01.230]  Well, let me think of fentanyls around here anywhere.
[02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:03.692]  His name's Mike?
[02:39:05.012 --> 02:39:05.273]  Yeah.
[02:39:07.174 --> 02:39:09.355]  You're not going to have a birthday, Mike!
[02:39:09.416 --> 02:39:12.598]  You take your fentanyl and go bye-bye, you stupid American!
[02:39:12.938 --> 02:39:14.039]  There is no hope!
[02:39:14.199 --> 02:39:15.580]  Biden belongs to us!
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:17.521]  You do not get a birthday, Mike!
[02:39:17.741 --> 02:39:18.582]  No, no, no!
[02:39:21.021 --> 02:39:21.501]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:39:21.801 --> 02:39:22.301]  You bet, brother.
[02:39:22.321 --> 02:39:23.102]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:24.162 --> 02:39:25.482]  Jeremiah in California.
[02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:26.363]  Go ahead, Jeremiah.
[02:39:27.823 --> 02:39:28.403]  Hello, Alex.
[02:39:29.003 --> 02:39:29.544]  Welcome.
[02:39:32.164 --> 02:39:34.085]  I have four points, man, here.
[02:39:34.465 --> 02:39:38.786]  One of them, hear out the whole thing here.
[02:39:39.366 --> 02:39:56.297]   If we can bring ourselves to the point of forgiving the people who have wronged us so badly in the New World Order, there's a possibility that they will see Mankind, go past the boundaries that we are limited to in our bodies right now, and then we'll see what we have the potential to become.
[02:39:57.797 --> 02:40:05.141]  And in time, that will be worse than anything that being outside the light of God can give them.
[02:40:06.861 --> 02:40:19.052]   But we have to do this, not as a thing to punish them, but as an actual, honest, inside thing to seriously Be the better person on the stuff.
[02:40:20.113 --> 02:40:21.173]  And not for a selfish reason.
[02:40:22.194 --> 02:40:27.777]  Second thing about this is, um, what Devo said they were going to distract us with last year was alien stuff.
[02:40:29.118 --> 02:40:32.160]  The balloons and UFOs are distractions from what they're doing.
[02:40:33.161 --> 02:40:37.744]  Keep in mind what they were talking about this year is, um, their attack on misinformation.
[02:40:38.444 --> 02:40:45.969]  So when they're letting people get back on, um, Twitter and stuff, it's a trying to keep the people in the, to keep the sheep in the pen.
[02:40:47.287 --> 02:40:49.648]  We can't, please try not to fall for that.
[02:40:50.928 --> 02:40:51.988]  And love is the way.
[02:40:52.888 --> 02:40:54.089]  Love is the way we're going to get through this.
[02:40:54.969 --> 02:40:59.650]  Loving people and not, loving people with our hearts.
[02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:08.272]  And I'll, and finally, I would like to know if you can actually put your, some of your promotions that you put up as for, for downloads, so I can put them in my YouTube account.
[02:41:10.333 --> 02:41:12.553]  Do what promotion?
[02:41:12.593 --> 02:41:17.437]   Those promotions, like the one you had with the, the doctor that was talking about the, um, The Nitrous?
[02:41:17.497 --> 02:41:18.558]  Who was talking about... Hi, Alex.
[02:41:18.837 --> 02:41:24.837]   Nitrous, who was talking about... Absolutely, we should, I think we have a promo page actually on Bandai Video.
[02:41:24.837 --> 02:41:28.837]   I don't think we put a lot of stuff up there, but yeah, we'll definitely do that. Thank you, great point.
[02:41:28.837 --> 02:41:31.837]  Let's talk to Joe in Michigan. Joe, go ahead.
[02:41:31.837 --> 02:41:35.837]  Hi, it's nice to meet you, sir. Nice to meet you.
[02:41:35.837 --> 02:41:42.837]   I've been listening for 15 years, and I've spent thousands of dollars at your store.
[02:41:43.708 --> 02:41:45.409]  My favorite product is X2.
[02:41:45.909 --> 02:41:54.794]  It seems to clear my mind up and increases my vocabulary and my ability to express myself much better.
[02:41:55.675 --> 02:41:59.037]  But I'd like to talk about World War III.
[02:41:59.657 --> 02:42:03.991]   I got some Bad news and some good news.
[02:42:04.851 --> 02:42:06.212]  I've been a Christian my whole life.
[02:42:06.252 --> 02:42:11.074]  I've known Christ since I was a kid, and I was a preacher for a while.
[02:42:13.114 --> 02:42:17.696]  But the bad news, I believe, is that the United States will be destroyed.
[02:42:17.716 --> 02:42:28.501]  And there's some biblical references about that in the book of Jeremiah, but they're kind of hard, they're kind of obscure, kind of hard to pan out, so to speak.
[02:42:30.632 --> 02:42:37.418]  The good news is, I've been praying about this lately, because, you know, I don't want to get blown up in a nuclear holocaust.
[02:42:37.458 --> 02:42:38.599]  I don't want to go off that way.
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:49.870]  And the Lord brought to my remembrance, you know, through the Holy Spirit, some of the verses in the Bible, and one story about Lot, you know, how God sent the angels to take him and his family out.
[02:42:50.410 --> 02:42:51.832]  Not just him, his family too.
[02:42:54.065 --> 02:43:02.107]  And then twice in the scriptures, once in Jeremiah like 49 or 50, chapter 49 or 50, he says, come out of her my people.
[02:43:02.527 --> 02:43:12.169]  And then again in chapter 18 of the book of Revelations, he says, come out of her my people.
[02:43:12.229 --> 02:43:12.689]  Well, sure.
[02:43:12.709 --> 02:43:14.049]  You see that also in Exodus.
[02:43:14.109 --> 02:43:14.769]  Thank you for the call.
[02:43:14.789 --> 02:43:15.269]  Great points.
[02:43:15.649 --> 02:43:18.310]  Let's talk to Ivan in Slovakia, Eastern Europe.
[02:43:18.390 --> 02:43:19.350]  Thanks for calling, Ivan.
[02:43:20.931 --> 02:43:25.333]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to be on your show.
[02:43:25.494 --> 02:43:27.314]  I mean, it's great.
[02:43:27.775 --> 02:43:28.455]  Three points.
[02:43:28.735 --> 02:43:37.300]  Mr. Jones, first-time caller, long-time listener, graduated in 2014 and kicked on from listening to you.
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:38.761]  Three points.
[02:43:40.001 --> 02:43:42.963]  Everybody knows Alex Jones here.
[02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:56.093]  I went to a cookout about a year ago, multicultural cookout, with my fellow Africans, fellow Mexicans, fellow Russians, fellow people from India, everywhere.
[02:43:56.633 --> 02:44:02.054]  And I took off my jacket and I had your shirt on that said Infowars in red.
[02:44:02.094 --> 02:44:05.675]  It was a black shirt with Infowars in red on the front.
[02:44:06.275 --> 02:44:10.036]  And everybody shook my hand and everybody was in sync with me.
[02:44:10.116 --> 02:44:14.804]   They knew what I was thinking and they knew who you were.
[02:44:15.244 --> 02:44:20.586]  They were so... I mean, the conversations we had were exhilarating.
[02:44:20.686 --> 02:44:21.947]  I mean, they were amazing.
[02:44:22.407 --> 02:44:23.367]  About everything.
[02:44:23.507 --> 02:44:24.147]  About you.
[02:44:24.567 --> 02:44:25.348]  About your show.
[02:44:25.388 --> 02:44:26.688]  About what you talked about.
[02:44:26.808 --> 02:44:31.210]  And about Disease X. You preached about Disease X for years.
[02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:32.390]  And it came.
[02:44:32.890 --> 02:44:34.491]  And everybody knew about it.
[02:44:34.891 --> 02:44:38.933]  And everybody I talked to at that cookout never took a vaccine.
[02:44:39.493 --> 02:44:40.093]  Never took.
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:42.141]  Testing, nothing.
[02:44:42.421 --> 02:44:55.429]  They're all hard-working people, very respectful, but they went on to live their lives without any pressure from any government, and they never took any of those vaccines.
[02:44:56.230 --> 02:45:11.395]   Second point, Mr. Jones, if you know John the Baptist in the Bible screaming in the wilderness about the Messiah coming, repent about Come, get baptized.
[02:45:11.755 --> 02:45:13.656]  Saving the way for the Messiah.
[02:45:14.057 --> 02:45:20.141]  Well, in today's world, Mr. Jones, you are John the Baptist, and we can hear you.
[02:45:20.641 --> 02:45:25.544]  And the funny thing is, they try to decapitate you, but they can't.
[02:45:26.265 --> 02:45:28.786]  They cannot, because you're ordained.
[02:45:29.647 --> 02:45:30.427]  We hear you.
[02:45:31.048 --> 02:45:33.249]  We hear you all the way from Slovakia.
[02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:34.810]  I'm originally from Virginia.
[02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:37.071]  I moved to Slovakia in 2020.
[02:45:39.111 --> 02:45:46.497]  And it's right before the pandemic hit there or here, but it's been amazing.
[02:45:46.857 --> 02:45:52.341]  It's been amazing to be part of your show.
[02:45:52.941 --> 02:45:57.565]  Last thing, I want to plug a couple of items, if you don't mind.
[02:45:59.046 --> 02:46:15.569]   Everybody listening, if you have the Red Pill, if you have the Fish Oil or Krill Oil, if you have X2, if you have Silver Bullet, If you have some, uh... I'm so excited.
[02:46:15.689 --> 02:46:16.551]  Okay, anyway.
[02:46:17.794 --> 02:46:19.498]  Put some water in your glass.
[02:46:20.414 --> 02:46:26.814]   Take those in the morning and your performance at work or anywhere and your mood is going to be so great.
[02:46:26.814 --> 02:46:27.614]  Many people...
[02:46:27.614 --> 02:46:30.574]   Well, these really are key compounds that Global is trying to keep us from having.
[02:46:30.574 --> 02:46:32.654]  And I'm sorry I gotta go, Ivan. Thanks for the support.
[02:46:32.654 --> 02:46:34.253]  The listeners are the best people in the world.
[02:46:34.253 --> 02:46:36.574]  I promise to get to Connor, Mike and Stephanie.
[02:46:36.574 --> 02:46:38.734]  Crew, don't let me forget. I'm gonna take calls tomorrow.
[02:46:38.734 --> 02:46:40.654]   Call them back if they want us to. They'll go to the front of the line.
[02:46:40.654 --> 02:46:43.534]  If not, then I'm sorry to make you hold.
[02:46:43.534 --> 02:46:46.894]   I tried my best. Owen Schroeder is coming up in about 20 minutes.
[02:46:46.894 --> 02:46:50.014]   I need to air this and I'll explain why here in just a moment.
[02:46:50.894 --> 02:46:53.934]   This is a clarification on what's going on with a lot of issues
[02:46:53.934 --> 02:47:00.813]   and with the whole situation with the attacks on free speech in this country.
[02:47:01.062 --> 02:47:10.069]   So we're going to air this important piece of information, then the main broadcast will end, and then Owen Schroyer We'll take over coming up at 3 p.m.
[02:47:10.129 --> 02:47:11.350]  Central Standard Time.
[02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:12.411]  Harrison Smith, 11 a.m.
[02:47:13.451 --> 02:47:14.472]  Of course, he starts at 8 a.m.
[02:47:14.492 --> 02:47:15.253]  I'll be back at 11 a.m.
[02:47:15.273 --> 02:47:15.593]  tomorrow.
[02:47:15.853 --> 02:47:16.694]  Great job, the crew.
[02:47:16.774 --> 02:47:17.515]  Great job, everybody.
[02:47:17.615 --> 02:47:18.095]  I love you.
[02:47:18.475 --> 02:47:19.076]  I appreciate you.
[02:47:19.096 --> 02:47:20.497]  We're gonna make it through this with God.
[02:47:20.797 --> 02:47:21.158]  God bless.
[02:47:22.421 --> 02:47:29.844]  The following is a clarification correction issued by myself, Alex Jones, here on InfoWars.
[02:47:30.724 --> 02:47:32.985]  As many know, I was sued by Ms.
[02:47:33.005 --> 02:47:39.068]  Scarlett Lewis concerning certain remarks I had made about the shooting and death of her son at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[02:47:39.828 --> 02:47:44.210]  In early August of 2022, we were in trial in Austin, Texas on Ms.
[02:47:44.270 --> 02:47:47.051]  Lewis' claims of defamation she filed against me.
[02:47:47.671 --> 02:47:48.572]  During that trial, Ms.
[02:47:48.612 --> 02:47:53.776]  Lewis and her ex-husband approached me to talk, which we did, and after a brief conversation, we shook hands.
[02:47:54.437 --> 02:48:01.263]  Later, I appeared on Piers Morgan's television show, talking about the trial, and recounted the brief conversation I had with Ms.
[02:48:01.303 --> 02:48:01.563]  Lewis.
[02:48:02.363 --> 02:48:06.187]  Recently, I received a letter from Mark Bengston, one of the lawyers for Ms.
[02:48:06.207 --> 02:48:09.489]  Carla Lewis, in the Texas Sandy Hook trial, in which Ms.
[02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:25.861]   Lewis' lawyer demanded from me a correction, clarification, or retraction of those few Statements I had made in January of 2023 on the Piers Morgan Show about the courtroom conversation with Miss Lewis, and I'm happy to oblige.
[02:48:26.801 --> 02:48:37.847]  First, I want the viewing audience to understand what I said and what Mr. Bankson has demanded of me so that my remarks today will clarify my retraction I'm going to make.
[02:48:38.187 --> 02:48:44.111]  It's important to keep in mind that during the trial, I continued to produce my live talk radio show.
[02:48:44.731 --> 02:48:52.995]  On the morning of August 2nd, 2022, I made certain comments about the tragic nature of the Sandy Hook shooting, where I confirmed that Ms.
[02:48:53.055 --> 02:48:57.496]  Lewis was real, and the shooting was real, and the death of her son was real.
[02:48:58.277 --> 02:48:58.477]  Ms.
[02:48:58.537 --> 02:49:10.542]  Lewis, however, was incorrectly told that I had attacked her as an actor in my broadcast, and she so testified, not having actually heard my on-air statements from that morning's broadcast.
[02:49:11.204 --> 02:49:13.207]  I was called to testify immediately after Ms.
[02:49:13.227 --> 02:49:16.312]  Lewis, and I immediately corrected her misperception.
[02:49:16.772 --> 02:49:19.196]  Later that afternoon, at a break, Ms.
[02:49:19.256 --> 02:49:22.180]  Lewis and her ex-husband walked over to me in the courtroom.
[02:49:22.721 --> 02:49:22.901]  Ms.
[02:49:22.921 --> 02:49:26.246]  Lewis handed me a bottle of water, and as I recall, a cough drop.
[02:49:26.747 --> 02:49:29.149]  We shook hands and we exchanged cordial words.
[02:49:29.649 --> 02:49:38.516]  Attorney Mark Bankston now wants me to retract what I remembered she said to me in that exchange, not what I told Piers Morgan's audience that I said to Ms.
[02:49:38.536 --> 02:49:38.796]  Lewis.
[02:49:39.336 --> 02:49:45.561]  I am going to quote from the letter Attorney Mark Bankston sent me where he repeats my words from the Piers Morgan Show.
[02:49:46.061 --> 02:49:56.829]  When I was in the Texas trial, you can look at this, they had one of the mothers on who lost her son and I went on my show that morning and taped it before I went to the court and I said, I think she is real.
[02:49:57.170 --> 02:49:58.331]  I think her son died.
[02:49:58.811 --> 02:50:02.874]  I'd seen her testimony the day before and I'm very sorry that Adam Lanza did this.
[02:50:03.314 --> 02:50:10.180]  And then she went on the stand and said, Jones attacked me and said I'm an actress and it's all fake today.
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:15.986]  And I walked over to her during the break, and I said, watch my show from today, your lawyers lied to you.
[02:50:17.647 --> 02:50:21.992]  And the next day, she came up and cried, and shook my hand, and it was Scarlett Lewis.
[02:50:23.694 --> 02:50:27.377]  And said, oh my God, it's true, I saw you did say that.
[02:50:28.158 --> 02:50:35.523]   And then, Bankston incorrectly quotes something I said after that as a quote attributed to her.
[02:50:36.043 --> 02:50:38.305]  I said, so there's a lot of manipulation there.
[02:50:38.545 --> 02:50:41.327]  But they attribute that in their letter to something I'm saying she said.
[02:50:42.048 --> 02:50:45.511]  Attorney Bankston's demand letter sets out his complaint as follows.
[02:50:45.951 --> 02:50:46.131]  Ms.
[02:50:46.151 --> 02:50:49.674]  Lewis never spoke those words or anything similar to Mr. Jones.
[02:50:50.215 --> 02:50:50.775]  And Ms.
[02:50:50.815 --> 02:50:56.280]  Lewis is disturbed that this lie was broadcast to millions of people, exposing her to contempt and ridicule.
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:03.506]  Finally, Attorney Bengston's demand letter concludes with criticism of my recollection of my conversation with Ms.
[02:51:03.566 --> 02:51:11.374]  Lewis, writing to me as follows, and I quote, Mr. Jones has now decided months later to lie about Ms.
[02:51:11.434 --> 02:51:18.801]  Lewis again by manufacturing a fantasy conversation and spreading it to an audience of millions to a reputational and emotional detriment.
[02:51:19.401 --> 02:51:24.106]  Attorney Bankston now demands that I retract my recollection of Ms.
[02:51:24.146 --> 02:51:26.408]  Lewis' response to me, which I am going to do.
[02:51:26.868 --> 02:51:30.092]  But first, let me say that I truly feel sympathy for Ms.
[02:51:30.132 --> 02:51:31.113]  Lewis and her ex-husband.
[02:51:31.413 --> 02:51:34.316]  They did suffer the death of their child, and I have repeatedly said this.
[02:51:34.656 --> 02:51:38.059]  So if my comments upset them, this was the last thing I wanted to do.
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:44.724]  Now, as to Attorney Bengston's demand that I retract my statement he quotes regarding Ms.
[02:51:44.765 --> 02:51:54.632]  Lewis's response to me on August 2nd, I have gone back and reviewed the video available of that day's event, and I want to show five relevant clips from these videos.
[02:51:55.072 --> 02:51:58.055]  These clips come from August 2nd, 2022.
[02:51:58.495 --> 02:51:59.696]  Number one shows Ms.
[02:51:59.736 --> 02:52:00.977]  Lewis's trial testimony.
[02:52:01.557 --> 02:52:04.640]  The second video, my response in trial testimony.
[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:08.303]  Third video, my actual morning on-air statements.
[02:52:08.603 --> 02:52:13.328]  Four, the end-of-day brief courtroom conversation and handshake I had with Ms.
[02:52:13.368 --> 02:52:13.648]  Lewis.
[02:52:14.028 --> 02:52:19.693]  And finally, number five, my August 3rd, the following morning, my court testimony about Ms.
[02:52:19.552 --> 02:52:26.552]  Lewis shaking my hand and how much I appreciated that handshake.
[02:52:26.552 --> 02:52:33.552]   I wanted to tell you to your face because I wanted you to know that I am a mother first
[02:52:33.552 --> 02:52:38.552]  and foremost and I know that you're a father.
[02:52:38.667 --> 02:52:40.448]  And my son existed.
[02:52:40.608 --> 02:52:51.896]  You're still on your show today trying to say that I'm implying that I'm an actress, that I'm deep state.
[02:52:52.296 --> 02:52:53.517]  You have, this week.
[02:52:54.617 --> 02:52:56.458]  And I don't understand.
[02:52:58.460 --> 02:52:58.920]  Truth.
[02:52:59.420 --> 02:53:03.603]  Truth is so vital to our world.
[02:53:03.683 --> 02:53:06.725]  Truth is what we base our reality on.
[02:53:07.746 --> 02:53:12.638]   And We have to agree on that to have a civil society.
[02:53:12.719 --> 02:53:14.399]  Sandy Hook is a hard truth.
[02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:15.520]  Hard truth.
[02:53:15.720 --> 02:53:22.144]  Nobody would want to ever believe that 26 kids could be murdered.
[02:53:22.404 --> 02:53:23.805]  Nobody would ever want to believe that.
[02:53:23.865 --> 02:53:26.927]  I understand people not wanting to believe that, actually.
[02:53:27.507 --> 02:53:28.508]  I don't want to believe it.
[02:53:29.861 --> 02:53:30.741]  Jesse was real.
[02:53:30.762 --> 02:53:32.222]  I am a real mom.
[02:53:32.642 --> 02:53:34.883]  There's nothing out there.
[02:53:34.943 --> 02:53:35.404]  Nothing.
[02:53:35.724 --> 02:53:38.585]  There's records of Jesse's birth.
[02:53:38.785 --> 02:53:39.546]  Of me.
[02:53:39.866 --> 02:53:41.727]  I mean, I have a history.
[02:53:42.367 --> 02:53:43.948]  And there's nothing that you could have found.
[02:53:44.968 --> 02:53:46.049]  Because it doesn't exist.
[02:53:46.549 --> 02:53:47.650]  That I'm deep state.
[02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:50.491]  It's just not true.
[02:53:51.391 --> 02:53:52.572]  I know you know that.
[02:53:52.712 --> 02:53:53.873]  That's the problem.
[02:53:54.133 --> 02:53:55.374]  I know you know that.
[02:53:55.915 --> 02:53:56.976]  And you keep saying it.
[02:53:57.036 --> 02:53:59.558]  You keep saying it.
[02:54:00.278 --> 02:54:00.799]  Why?
[02:54:01.779 --> 02:54:02.280]  Why?
[02:54:02.700 --> 02:54:03.161]  For money?
[02:54:03.181 --> 02:54:07.524]  Because you've made a lot of money while you've said it.
[02:54:08.605 --> 02:54:17.212]  I know you're... I mean... I know you believe me.
[02:54:18.524 --> 02:54:23.786]  And yet you're going to leave this courthouse and you're going to say it again on your show.
[02:54:26.648 --> 02:54:27.408]  You're saying no.
[02:54:27.507 --> 02:54:29.507]  You just did it.
[02:54:29.507 --> 02:54:39.507]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:54:39.494 --> 02:54:41.394]  I apologize to both.
[02:54:41.695 --> 02:54:42.295]  Sustained.
[02:54:42.435 --> 02:54:46.637]  So Mr. Jones, one of the instructions I just gave you is that this is not a conversation.
[02:54:47.262 --> 02:54:49.823]  That I never intentionally tried to hurt you.
[02:54:50.343 --> 02:54:54.084]  I never even said your name until this case came to court.
[02:54:54.104 --> 02:54:58.525]  I didn't even really know who you were until a couple years ago when all this started up.
[02:54:58.545 --> 02:55:01.085]  The internet had a lot of questions.
[02:55:01.225 --> 02:55:01.985]  I had questions.
[02:55:02.805 --> 02:55:13.088]  And over that six, seven year period before I got sued, or six year period, it's clear, you can see the whole progression of us, the few times we covered it, trying to actually find out what happened.
[02:55:13.848 --> 02:55:23.152]   And That's really been my big frustration, is that people have said that I'm personally trying to hurt them or coming after them.
[02:55:23.172 --> 02:55:27.754]  When I question every big event, a lot of times it turns out that we've not been told the truth.
[02:55:28.434 --> 02:55:34.076]  And a perfect example is today, where they play a one-minute clip.
[02:55:34.636 --> 02:55:37.117]  And I had just done that this morning.
[02:55:37.877 --> 02:55:54.193]   And I knew that I said, I believe that Scarlett Lewis is real, and she's a really nice person, and she's really a sweet person, and then I went through and talked about her ex-husband, too, and then I said, I believe they're being fed and manipulated.
[02:55:54.213 --> 02:56:03.475]  Do you feel that the video clip was a fair representation of what you meant to convey?
[02:56:04.255 --> 02:56:06.155]  No, it had the front and back, no.
[02:56:06.556 --> 02:56:08.596]  Okay, and why wasn't it fair?
[02:56:09.608 --> 02:56:19.513]  Because it had the front and back cut off of it to totally misrepresent the apology at the end and at the first where I said I believe she's a real person and lost her child.
[02:56:19.533 --> 02:56:26.097]  So someone edited that and then showed it to her and then they brought it in here and played it to show it to you.
[02:56:26.197 --> 02:56:33.197]  and I think you should ask to see the full segment.
[02:56:33.197 --> 02:56:36.356]  I'm not going to say this.
[02:56:36.448 --> 02:56:39.290]  I've now met Neil Heslin and his ex-wife.
[02:56:40.050 --> 02:56:41.151]  Those people are real.
[02:56:41.671 --> 02:56:42.752]  Once I saw them in person.
[02:56:42.772 --> 02:56:44.033]  A lot of anomalies.
[02:56:44.093 --> 02:56:45.334]  The government lies so much.
[02:56:45.654 --> 02:56:46.795]  They have a right to question things.
[02:56:46.875 --> 02:56:48.336]  I thought Jussie Smollett was a lie.
[02:56:48.656 --> 02:56:49.356]  I said it first.
[02:56:49.837 --> 02:56:50.577]  Went out on a limb.
[02:56:50.757 --> 02:56:51.278]  I was right.
[02:56:52.078 --> 02:56:52.959]  Most of the time I'm right.
[02:56:53.639 --> 02:56:54.580]  We saw anomalies.
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:56.181]  I wasn't the first to bring up the anomalies.
[02:56:56.621 --> 02:56:57.802]  Some of the anomalies are gonna be a fraud.
[02:56:58.222 --> 02:57:03.435]   I've spent days, literally, Seven feet, eight feet away from Heslin.
[02:57:03.655 --> 02:57:05.175]  Because we're sitting right there, they're sitting right there.
[02:57:05.215 --> 02:57:06.195]  That guy's real.
[02:57:07.615 --> 02:57:12.015]   If my asking questions about public events hurt these people's feelings, I'm sorry.
[02:57:12.015 --> 02:57:22.015]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:57:22.015 --> 02:57:32.015]  [INAUDIBLE]
[02:57:32.015 --> 02:57:42.014]  [INAUDIBLE]
[02:57:42.014 --> 02:57:52.014]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:57:52.014 --> 02:57:54.014]  (garbled speech)
[02:57:53.686 --> 02:57:54.186]  That's it.
[02:57:54.206 --> 02:57:57.348]  I'm not talking to you anymore.
[02:57:57.388 --> 02:57:59.009]  You're not doing this.
[02:57:59.049 --> 02:57:59.809]  That's not even a thought.
[02:57:59.829 --> 02:58:01.590]  That's not the way this goes.
[02:58:01.710 --> 02:58:04.171]  I'm not sure if I'm in.
[02:58:04.211 --> 02:58:04.371]  Why?
[02:58:04.732 --> 02:58:09.714]  Because you can't see those fake videos anymore?
[02:58:09.754 --> 02:58:11.855]  Thank you.
[02:58:12.034 --> 02:58:19.034]  [inaudible]
[02:58:19.034 --> 02:58:21.034]  I apologize for that.
[02:58:21.034 --> 02:58:34.034]  [inaudible]
[02:58:33.836 --> 02:58:37.195]   And that he's slow and not just- No, I'm slow about shit.
[02:58:37.195 --> 02:58:37.695]  Yeah.
[02:58:37.695 --> 02:58:39.697]  [INAUDIBLE]
[02:58:39.697 --> 02:58:40.936]  I'll be honest on my end.
[02:58:40.936 --> 02:58:45.636]  I think you both have been manipulating people.
[02:58:45.636 --> 02:58:47.976]  That's it, you're not doing this.
[02:58:47.976 --> 02:58:49.617]  That's not even a thought.
[02:58:49.617 --> 02:58:51.136]  That's not the way this goes.
[02:58:51.136 --> 02:58:52.256]  That's why we're shutting him in.
[02:58:52.256 --> 02:58:52.895]  Okay.
[02:58:52.895 --> 02:58:53.395]  Yeah.
[02:58:59.136 --> 02:59:04.136]   Actually proud of the fact that I got a chance to have Neal and
[02:59:04.136 --> 02:59:10.055]   Scarlett come over to me and shake my hand and talk to me yesterday.
[02:59:10.055 --> 02:59:12.976]  So I can tell them face to face that I'm sorry.
[02:59:12.976 --> 02:59:17.936]   Hopefully after watching these actual video clips, several matters are clear.
[02:59:18.521 --> 02:59:22.122]  First, it shows that the trial testimony of Ms.
[02:59:22.182 --> 02:59:28.105]  Lewis about her understanding of my on-air statements earlier in the morning of trial was wrong.
[02:59:28.545 --> 02:59:36.990]   I told her in the courtroom, That I had not attacked her that day as the video of my actual on-air statements that morning demonstrate.
[02:59:37.551 --> 02:59:46.444]  Second, my on-air video clip that morning demonstrates that I clearly said that I know you're real and I know that the death of your son is real.
[02:59:47.345 --> 02:59:55.404]   Third, These clips show that after my testimony that day in the courtroom, I had a conversation that was initiated by Ms.
[02:59:55.464 --> 02:59:56.905]  Lewis that ended with Ms.
[02:59:56.965 --> 03:00:00.948]  Lewis and me shaking hands and her ex-husband and I shaking hands.
[03:00:01.888 --> 03:00:07.172]  Unfortunately, the audio I have of these changes is poor and you cannot hear much of what we're saying.
[03:00:07.532 --> 03:00:10.914]  But it seems clear that while we were shaking hands, we were talking.
[03:00:11.294 --> 03:00:17.959]   And while they are not all recorded as the one I just showed, I had several courthouse conversations with Ms.
[03:00:17.999 --> 03:00:20.722]  Lewis, and all of them were polite and civil.
[03:00:21.143 --> 03:00:26.988]  To be clear and clarify, I had multiple discussions, at least three, with Scarlett Lewis and her husband.
[03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:29.371]  We only caught it on tape one time.
[03:00:29.751 --> 03:00:33.014]  And what I said on Piers Morgan was a composite of those discussions.
[03:00:33.775 --> 03:00:36.476]  It is the precise words that Ms.
[03:00:36.516 --> 03:00:44.039]  Lewis and I exchanged before and after our handshake that Attorney Bankson now objects to and wants me to retract, which I am glad to do.
[03:00:44.919 --> 03:00:46.800]  I do not wish to harm or damage Ms.
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:52.402]  Lewis in any way, and if she does not agree with my recollection of her response to me, I will defer to Ms.
[03:00:52.422 --> 03:00:59.305]  Lewis' recollection of her statements and withdraw and disclaim my recollections of what she said in our conversation.
[03:00:59.725 --> 03:01:01.567]  While I am sure of what I told Ms.
[03:01:01.587 --> 03:01:10.473]  Lewis, I defer entirely to her recollection of what she said in response, and if she disagrees, then I will withdraw and retract my recollection of her comments.
[03:01:11.514 --> 03:01:13.456]  In conclusion, I want to emphasize...
[03:01:14.735 --> 03:01:18.777]  That I have no ill will, ill feelings, or any malice towards Ms.
[03:01:18.817 --> 03:01:19.897]  Lewis or her ex-husband.
[03:01:20.717 --> 03:01:28.680]  I know and understand they have suffered a tragedy with the murder of their son, and I do not wish to cause them any further grief, harm, or embarrassment.
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:36.243]  I once again would like to invite them to come on my show to promote their charity and to talk about their son's life if they so choose.
[03:01:36.602 --> 03:01:40.762]   I am also trying to reach an agreement for another appearance on Piers Morgan's show
[03:01:40.762 --> 03:01:43.962]  to let his audience hear this clarification and correction.
[03:01:43.962 --> 03:01:53.961]  [MUSIC]
[03:01:53.961 --> 03:01:59.961]  [MUSIC]
[03:01:59.961 --> 03:02:00.961]  InfoWars.
[03:02:01.344 --> 03:02:02.227]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:02:02.328 --> 03:02:21.688]  today.
[03:02:21.748 --> 03:02:25.591]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[03:02:25.611 --> 03:02:30.014]  I contribute with like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[03:02:30.154 --> 03:02:37.519]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natokinase.
[03:02:37.639 --> 03:02:39.760]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:02:39.961 --> 03:02:45.605]   This one is the only Enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:02:45.645 --> 03:02:46.406]  This is very important.
[03:02:46.426 --> 03:02:51.250]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:02:51.470 --> 03:02:52.951]  People are low with the spike protein.
[03:02:52.971 --> 03:02:53.812]  They don't feel well.
[03:02:53.932 --> 03:02:55.554]  This is a potential solution.
[03:02:55.634 --> 03:02:58.616]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:02:58.696 --> 03:03:01.479]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:03:01.619 --> 03:03:02.620]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:08.845]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.

[03:03:40.498 --> 03:03:42.119]  Yeah, this is a big announcement.
[03:03:42.179 --> 03:03:44.620]  When I invented my pillow, that was in 2004.
[03:03:45.061 --> 03:03:46.041]  It took a year to invent.
[03:03:46.621 --> 03:03:47.702]  Nothing ever changed.
[03:03:47.722 --> 03:03:50.003]  It was the best patented fill, the best.
[03:03:50.023 --> 03:03:53.665]  Remember, sleep is about height and staying there, and temperature.
[03:03:54.205 --> 03:04:02.190]  Well now, I found out about a year and a half ago about temperature regulating thread that's made here in the U.S.
[03:04:02.490 --> 03:04:10.314]   So I have this fabric made And I said, you know, let's make an exclusive MyPillow fabric and see if it works with the great patented fill.
[03:04:10.754 --> 03:04:12.535]  I've slept on it now for two months.
[03:04:12.956 --> 03:04:15.497]  This stuff is cool to the touch.
[03:04:15.557 --> 03:04:17.958]  You're not going to be flipping that pillow to the cool side.
[03:04:18.419 --> 03:04:20.660]  It is the most, the best pillow in history.
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:21.921]  Just got even better.
[03:04:22.361 --> 03:04:24.282]  And we're doing the buy one, get one free.
[03:04:25.409 --> 03:04:36.999]  We just actually got these into production last week, and the commercial for it, it was one of our big movie commercials we made, where the one in the mirror, that comes out in about 10 days.
[03:04:37.019 --> 03:04:44.986]  So you're getting them here, one of the first ones to get them in the country, and trust me, it brings sleep to a whole new level.
[03:04:45.266 --> 03:04:46.948]  They're absolutely the best bill ever.
[03:04:47.908 --> 03:04:54.330]  You have great products, hundreds of great products, but more importantly, you're using the money to fight the New World Order fearlessly.
