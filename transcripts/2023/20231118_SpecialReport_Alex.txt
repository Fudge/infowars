[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.661]  In 1996, the U.N.
[00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.603]  said they would use food as a weapon.
[00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:09.925]  And now they've told us they're going to ban humans eating meat.
[00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:11.446]  But how are they going to do it?
[00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:25.958]  We've now discovered that many modern vaccines and the Moderna and Pfizer shots have a bovine protein in them that then creates an autoimmune response in those that take the shot so that many of them can no longer eat beef.
[00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:29.441]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's in the literature, it's in the documents.
[00:00:29.902 --> 00:00:35.108]  The plan to poison the food supply isn't coming, it's here, by poisoning us to where we're allergic to beef.
[00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:36.469]  And that's just the start.
[00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.653]  This is the total weaponization of the food supply.
[00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.973]  This is how the globalists are making their move.
[00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:46.973]  [Music]
[00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:54.963]   Okay, last week I did a special report that was part one of getting into the fact that the globalists from all the
[00:00:54.963 --> 00:00:58.973]   research and all the evidence we have are preparing to attack the food supply.
[00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:03.839]  They're already doing it with GMO, they're already doing it with glyphosate, they're already doing it with so many things.
[00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.060]  And this is very similar to what happened with glyphosate, we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:16.645]  But now they're all over BBC and Associated Press and USA Today saying the next pandemic will come through the food supply.
[00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:20.654]  And it's not safe and we need the UN regulators to take control.
[00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:25.718]  You see them shutting down farms in the Netherlands, shutting down farms in Ireland, and shutting down farms in areas of Asia.
[00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.002]  Causing massive upheaval, social unrest, and starvation.
[00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.344]  An angrier world that Klaus Schwab talked about.
[00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:33.935]  So this is part two.
[00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:37.919]  We're going to do part three, part four, part five, at least six parts on this.
[00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.345]  And we're planning to make a documentary about the enemy's next attack plan.
[00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:49.131]  And it's going to be bigger than just attacking the food supply, but that's going to be a big part of the film that is now in production.
[00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:51.074]  But this info is too powerful and too important.
[00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:52.275]  We've got to get it out now.
[00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:57.220]  There's a tick called the Lone Star Tick that's in many parts of the United States.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:17.825]   And the Lone Star Tick has a protein crystal in it that if it bites you, Can begin to replicate in your body, and your body will then have an autoimmune response to that protein, so that if you ever experience that protein again, in any other type of meat, you will then feel absolutely terrible and have an autoimmune response.
[00:02:17.845 --> 00:02:23.609]  So I can give you a bit stung by a bee, and then you can get an allergy to it, but next time it could make you really sick, could even kill you.
[00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.612]  So here's the information we are about to break down.
[00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:28.033]  This is beyond critical.
[00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:31.192]  So they're hyping up, we need to get rid of beef.
[00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.393]  They're hyping up, you will soon eat the bugs.
[00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:37.353]   They are saying we've got to stop producing beef because of methane and all these lies.
[00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:42.332]   You know, the sea levels are gonna rise and kill us all like they've been saying for decades that it didn't happen.
[00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:47.393]   And then they come out and say, because of this tick, it turns out a large part of the population
[00:02:47.393 --> 00:02:55.472]   is suddenly not gonna be able to eat beef anymore, particularly because of this chemical that it puts in you
[00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:56.832]  or this prion crystal.
[00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.526]  Very similar to mad cow disease.
[00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:02.970]  You remember that showed up in England and had to kill millions of cows and sheep and all the rest of it.
[00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.211]  Most of them didn't even have it.
[00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:07.534]  It came from feeding rotten meat to cows and sheep.
[00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.575]  They weren't even supposed to eat meat.
[00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:20.405]  Remember, they were taking dead animals, even dead pets, and grinding them up with wheat and corn and turning it into what they call a goo or an ooze, literally, and feeding it to them.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:31.002]  Then the crystals would begin to grow in the guts, because their guts aren't designed to eat meat, and go through the gut wall into the brain, and then it would grow the crystals inside of the brain.
[00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:41.665]  So, I'm going to go over here to the desk with Rob Due that's with me, because he's done even more research on this than I have, and we're going to go over just this one big piece of the puzzle, because guess what?
[00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.465]  The tick that bites you?
[00:03:45.487 --> 00:03:57.133]  It puts the same protein in you that they admit is in many of the so-called vaccines, and the CDC even admits that it could be the vaccines that are giving this to people.
[00:03:57.493 --> 00:04:03.076]  Kind of like Reuters and AP admit most polio cases are from Bill Gates and the UN vaccine.
[00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:07.058]  Just like you think glyphosate's a problem.
[00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:20.085]   This is much worse, but remember, They first only sprayed Roundup or Glyphosate on corn crops and on soybeans when they were growing to kill weeds, but usually early on so the corn could get going or the soybeans could get going.
[00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:21.206]  One application.
[00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:32.152]  Then they learned they could spray it on the wheat when it was becoming ripe or ready for harvest in the late summer, early fall, because they would lose a lot of the wheat because of fungal growth.
[00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:37.775]  Well, it turns out that if you spray glyphosate, it also kills fungus, but it was soaking on the wheat.
[00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:46.880]  And as soon as that got approved in the early 2000s, that's when you saw the massive, quote, gluten intolerancy exploding.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.460]  People never had it.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.923]  Because what you're intolerant to is glyphosate that will literally kill you long term, grow cancers, you name it.
[00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:58.026]  So this is the same thing where it's in the shots, it's in the vaccines, it's in the vaccines they're giving the cows.
[00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:01.007]  Particularly, it starts growing in them.
[00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.108]  You eat them, you get sick.
[00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.954]  And see, now people can't eat beef anymore, just like we saw wheat sales get cut in half the last 15, 16, 17 years.
[00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:13.316]  And, oh, I just suddenly can't eat gluten.
[00:05:13.517 --> 00:05:14.657]  It's not the gluten, folks.
[00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.020]  It's you have a Roundup allergy because it's a poison.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:30.288]   So we're gonna go over to the desk right here, and I'm gonna show you this in part two, then part three, part four, part five, at least six parts just on this, because they tell you imminently You're not going to be able to eat beef or other meats anymore.
[00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.189]  And they're the ones running the whole system.
[00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:34.589]  So we're going to break this down.
[00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:35.089]  Stay with us.
[00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.750]  Rob, we really know what they're about to do.
[00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.650]  They always pre-plan.
[00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.630]  They always pre-program.
[00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.170]  Let's go over this research.
[00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.550]  Yeah, so we got the Mayo Clinic here.
[00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.011]  Just talking about alpha-gal syndrome.
[00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:47.411]  It's a food allergy that makes people allergic to red meat and other products from mammals.
[00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:53.632]  So anything that a mammal, that would be goat, that would be pig, anything like that, you're going to become allergic to it.
[00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:54.613]  Now here's the thing.
[00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:55.713]  One of the cow identifies as a duck.
[00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:56.173]  I'm sorry.
[00:05:56.193 --> 00:05:56.913]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:57.433 --> 00:06:00.855]  Uh, and they're saying here, of course, it's just the Lone Star tip, nothing else.
[00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:03.277]  But here, these products may contain Alpha-Gal.
[00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:06.059]  So, of course, they talk about meats, but that's from the CDC.
[00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.640]  And this is a CDC document right here.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.541]  You flip this over.
[00:06:08.761 --> 00:06:10.402]  Non-food products that contain Alpha-Gal.
[00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:11.462]  Oh, vaccines.
[00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:12.423]  Oh, okay.
[00:06:12.503 --> 00:06:14.685]  And it's an additive, a stabilizer, or a coating.
[00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:19.990]  And it said it could be in the gelatin, in the glycerin, magnesium cerate, or bovine extract.
[00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:27.880]  Bovine extract is what you get when you basically take a fetal cow and, you know, grind it up and turn it into a medium that this stuff grows on.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.785]  So it could also be from other... Yeah, they used to grow it on dead babies, now they grow it on dead cows.
[00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:33.406]  Exactly.
[00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:35.869]  Yeah, they don't do... Well, they still do some, but yeah.
[00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.510]  But then you go to the link here.
[00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.270]  There's a link right here.
[00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.991]  You go to that.
[00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:42.973]  Here's the link that shows all the vaccines that could potentially have this.
[00:06:43.353 --> 00:06:46.275]  And I just highlighted the ones with bovine serum in it.
[00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:48.336]  So the DTaP vaccine is one.
[00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.278]  Hepatitis A, MMR.
[00:06:50.298 --> 00:06:52.499]  They have similar lipid particles that grow protein.
[00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.600]  Right, different MMRs, the rotavirus.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.641]  So they're obsessed with colonizing us with proteins.
[00:06:56.942 --> 00:06:57.422]  Exactly.
[00:06:57.662 --> 00:07:01.164]  And they can add to the protein, the type of protein it is, to cause an allergic response.
[00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:08.628]  Kind of like the UN got caught adding a hormone in second trimester pregnancies to tetanus shots to create spontaneous miscarriages.
[00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.509]  Exactly.
[00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:13.690]  So you have all these different vaccines that have the different products that they mentioned in here.
[00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.312]  Gelatin, glycerin, bovine extract, magnesium serrate.
[00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:19.012]  Now here's an interesting article here.
[00:07:19.392 --> 00:07:20.973]  And again, the tick puts the same protein in you.
[00:07:21.293 --> 00:07:26.715]  Anaphylaxis after zoster vaccine, that's your shingles vaccine, implicating alpha-gal allergy as possible mechanism.
[00:07:27.015 --> 00:07:29.296]  Now what's one of the things you do get from the COVID vaccine?
[00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:33.317]  A side effect is herpes zoster virus, which is also known as shingles.
[00:07:33.778 --> 00:07:36.559]  So right there, here's a connection from PubMed.
[00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:43.706]  Right there on their website, anaphylaxis after zoster vaccine implicating alpha-gal allergy is possible mechanism.
[00:07:43.786 --> 00:07:51.674]  So somehow the alpha-gal is getting into the vaccines, of course they're doing it on purpose, then it's getting into your body and then all of a sudden you have an allergy to red meat.
[00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.092]  And that's how we're going to be taught to eat the bugs.
[00:07:55.512 --> 00:08:00.133]  We warned you nine years ago with Dr. Edward Gribb about mRNA shots now that we're coming.
[00:08:00.754 --> 00:08:03.134]  We predicted everything that happened three and a half years ago.
[00:08:03.194 --> 00:08:04.155]  We told you what would unfold.
[00:08:04.695 --> 00:08:06.576]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are pre-programming everybody.
[00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:07.536]  Everybody ready.
[00:08:08.036 --> 00:08:10.817]  Everybody prepared that you're not going to be able to eat meat anymore.
[00:08:10.877 --> 00:08:18.980]  And already I know a bunch of people who can't eat red meat now that have this allergy and they weren't bitten by a tick, but they have been taking the quote modern vaccines.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.241]  So, they don't want you eating meat.
[00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:22.941]  They give you a very serious allergy.
[00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:24.422]  And they can do this right down the line.
[00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:25.522]  They don't want you to have a baby.
[00:08:25.862 --> 00:08:26.802]  You take the tetanus shot.
[00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:29.663]  The UN got caught doing it on record in the mid-90s in Africa.
[00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:34.705]  They add the hormone that the mother releases at the start of the second trimester.
[00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:36.866]  The body then creates an autoimmune response to that.
[00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:38.966]  Attacks the baby 100% of the time.
[00:08:39.366 --> 00:08:40.767]  Spontaneous miscarriage.
