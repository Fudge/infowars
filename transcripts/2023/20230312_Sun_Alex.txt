[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.359]  [Music]
[00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.239]  It's Sunday, March 12th, 2020.
[00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.069]  This is a very special broadcast.
[00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.831]  Spread the word now.
[00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:25.952]  Win the InfoWars.
[00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:26.913]  Defeat the Globalists.
[00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.457]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:55.369]   Ladies and gentlemen, Rebel forces not just here but around the world fighting the anti-human technocracy are striking back and having some of the biggest victories in the history of the fight in the last 70 years against the globalist transhumanist New World Order.
[00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.551]  We are in the fight tonight.
[00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:04.214]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday transmission.
[00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:20.005]  Yesterday, I did an hour and a half commercial-free, incredible interview with General Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the former chief advisor on foreign policy and military affairs, the national security advisor to President Trump.
[00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:26.301]  He's a very humble guy, and he also stops and listens to the host he's on with all the time.
[00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:28.582]  But I did a really good job yesterday.
[00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:34.965]  Out of an hour and a half or so, or more with him, I probably talked 10 minutes of it.
[00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.967]  So he really got his flow going.
[00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:40.447]  And I mean, I know the New World Order.
[00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:42.928]  I'm thinking three, four moves ahead.
[00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:45.069]  He was thinking five, six moves ahead.
[00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:47.449]  This is a historic interview.
[00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.509]  The full thing's posted.
[00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:53.590]  The band out video on the front page of InfoWars.com will be posted on the live show feed tonight.
[00:01:54.691 --> 00:02:00.292]  We're going to air major excerpts of it tonight because it is important.
[00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:04.353]  Very, very, very important.
[00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:11.770]  So, that is coming up here in just about 20-30 minutes from now, The Nolan Schroer, 6 p.m.
[00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:23.579]  Central with Sunday Live, two hours of live radio slash TV, only six minutes commercials an hour, so it's a very powerful transmission that you definitely want to be tuning into in about two hours from now.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.180]  Okay.
[00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:30.838]  When I was live yesterday, Flynn was watching.
[00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:31.519]  I didn't know that.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.946]  And the first thing he said when he came on is, Alex, you're right, they're trying to crash the banks.
[00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.433]  You're right, they've done this Silicon Valley bank collapse.
[00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:42.397]  To create the collapse.
[00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.389]  But we should not panic and let them do that.
[00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:50.911]  Well, today, CNN, ABC News, the BBC, I've got the articles right here.
[00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:52.032]  They're like, it's over!
[00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:53.672]  All the banks are collapsing!
[00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:54.493]  Run for the hills!
[00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:55.813]  Bigger than 2008!
[00:02:56.174 --> 00:03:00.615]  Don't worry though, we've got central bank digital currencies there, and we're gonna save you with these.
[00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:05.758]  Oh, there's only a couple hundred billion left in the FDIC after they bailed out 150 to 200 billion.
[00:03:05.778 --> 00:03:14.514]   They haven't been clear yet on Silicon Valley Bank, the second largest independent lender in the country that actually loans to people.
[00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:19.358]  But that's okay, because they're going to have a new system.
[00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:22.360]  They haven't told us yet, but you know, it's Central Bank Digital Currency.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.081]  They've been prepping it.
[00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:23.941]  They've been getting it ready.
[00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:26.283]  This is so important.
[00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:32.508]  So I've been saying for months, the next shooter drop is a bank run, a bank collapse, because you can see him teeing it up on Wednesday last week.
[00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.470]  Biden put out his new national directive.
[00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.313]  The most important thing is Central Bank Digital Currency to deal with volatility in the market.
[00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:42.212]  Stock market took cues on that, sort of plunging Thursday and Friday.
[00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:51.554]  They are artificially, they locked down our houses, locked down our businesses, locked us down in the last few years and imploded the third world with two plus years of lockdowns.
[00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:56.355]  They're now getting a new one ready, just cutting off liquidity in the market.
[00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:05.077]  And I get we've got zombie banks and inflation and all of it, but the Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates five, six times last year.
[00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:11.939]   If they don't cut them now, You know they're deliberately trying to put the economy into cardiac arrest.
[00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.160]  And I'm not saying that's even a good way to go, but that's the lesser of two evils.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.961]  So we've got all of this and more, ladies and gentlemen, to cover tonight.
[00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:29.683]  Meanwhile, the globalist leftist pope comes out against transgenderism and says it's a Trojan horse to bring down civilization.
[00:04:30.443 --> 00:04:32.664]  Wow, what's going on with this guy?
[00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:35.004]  We've got so much more.
[00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:41.001]   We're going to be Breaking down here tonight.
[00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:43.862]  But remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:46.823]  This is the information war, it's a participation sport.
[00:04:47.283 --> 00:04:55.185]  So go to InfoWars.com, pick the live show feed, go to Band.Video, share the links now in your email, your text messages, word of mouth.
[00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:56.626]  Override the AI.
[00:04:56.746 --> 00:05:02.707]  Humanity will and can win against these systems of generative AI.
[00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:05.028]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:09.028]  [Music]
[00:05:09.028 --> 00:05:10.028]  [Gunshot]
[00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:14.028]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, March 12th, 20--
[00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:24.820]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:36.781]   Well, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former Chief National Security Advisor to President Trump, a very humble man, But yesterday, I had him on for an hour and a half for a commercial-free emergency Saturday transmission.
[00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:39.742]  And I said, I'm going to try to stand down and not talk too much.
[00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:41.863]  Can you really give a steep analysis?
[00:05:41.963 --> 00:05:44.184]  And let me tell you, it's as hardcore as it gets.
[00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:47.926]  The full interviews at Man.Video, InfoWars.com, these go viral.
[00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:51.047]  We're going to hear big excerpts of it here tonight.
[00:05:52.088 --> 00:05:53.708]  But first, let's hit the big issue.
[00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.427]   It's clear that the corporate media around the world
[00:05:58.427 --> 00:06:01.587]  is trying to create a bank panic and a rush on banks.
[00:06:01.587 --> 00:06:04.507]   So there's not enough cash in the banks, there's plenty of digital money
[00:06:04.507 --> 00:06:10.146]   and the central private banks are not gonna prop up the regional and local banks and credit unions.
[00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:15.106]   So they all go down and they can bring in the central bank digital currencies,
[00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:19.266]   the centralized system that totally controls every fast year life.
[00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:20.766]  We've been predicting this.
[00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:23.387]  I asked the archivist yesterday to look into it.
[00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:29.146]   He put out a 20 minute video with more than 15 clips of myself the last two years,
[00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:33.246]   predicting they would shut down regional banks with bank runs and do all this.
[00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:40.506]   It's an obvious next move, but here's some of the headlines right now on this front.
[00:06:40.506 --> 00:06:45.947]  All starting, all starting, zoom in a bit on that please.
[00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:56.067]   All starting with Silicon Valley Bank, Silicon Valley Bank that Kramer and all the rest of them
[00:06:56.067 --> 00:07:00.507]   were telling people was absolutely invincible just two weeks ago.
[00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:16.756]   Kramer's job in my view, and he always does this over and over again, is they need to get The old investors, the rich investors out, he'll go and push and say the best deal is something that's about to implode to get your new money to pay off the old money or to prop up the Ponzi scheme before they pull the plug.
[00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:23.099]  It's like Tucker Carlson said, if Kramer endorses something, you need to run the other direction.
[00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.402]  But after all, that's what NBC and MSNBC and CNBC are all about.
[00:07:29.222 --> 00:07:32.764]  US banks sitting on unrealized losses of $620 billion.
[00:07:36.062 --> 00:07:38.702]  That's what CNN's reporting.
[00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:43.822]  Entire US Congress votes to declassify COVID-19 origins.
[00:07:43.822 --> 00:07:46.302]  That's a good piece of news.
[00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:51.981]   Swift, one of the biggest international banking consortium networks,
[00:07:51.981 --> 00:08:00.942]   to conduct more tests with CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currencies, due to the situation with Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:02.316]  Told you yesterday that was coming.
[00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:03.476]  They announced it today.
[00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:04.617]  They've already got it all set up.
[00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:09.257]  Oh, we can't give you your money back, but we'll give you a new digital currency back that we control.
[00:08:11.198 --> 00:08:14.498]  And it just goes on from that point.
[00:08:14.618 --> 00:08:16.919]  So, this is big, big news.
[00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:23.957]  CDC, FDA sent a letter to Florida Surgeon General warning he is endangering lives with COVID vaccine risk advice.
[00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:28.720]  Even though those risks were admitted, we'll get to that a little bit later.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.241]  But let's get back into the banking situation.
[00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:34.063]  Silicon Valley Bank imploded in a single day.
[00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.484]  It could be just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:08:37.264 --> 00:08:44.388]  Yahoo News, this is the scare tactic they're using, just like they triggered the 2008 crash to bring in Obama.
[00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.184]  The government has 48 hours.
[00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:55.148]  Billionaire investor Bill Ackerman calls on Biden to bail out SVB on Monday morning or face catastrophic market meltdown and loss of tens of thousands of jobs.
[00:08:56.729 --> 00:09:00.951]  Silicon Valley Bank employees received bonuses hours before government takeover.
[00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:06.554]  The director and CEO of it took out $3.6 million the day before it imploded.
[00:09:07.342 --> 00:09:09.164]  SVB fallout spreads around the world.
[00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.505]  Vermont into Singapore.
[00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.466]  Bank runs all over the planet.
[00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:13.347]  Again, Yahoo News.
[00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:18.190]  British tech sector a serious risk after SVB collapse, says the government.
[00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:19.572]  France 24.
[00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:22.594]  It goes on and on.
[00:09:22.634 --> 00:09:29.399]  Silicon Valley bank crisis will force the Fed to slash rates by 100 basis points to prevent contagion, says market guru.
[00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:30.019]  Yahoo News.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:30.960]  Yellen.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.142]  No federal bailout for collapsed Silicon Valley bank.
[00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:37.368]  And it goes on from there.
[00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:40.569]  So they're going after regional banks.
[00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:48.372]  They're going after local banks to the big central banks and the big private equity groups and poses the saviors.
[00:09:48.472 --> 00:09:49.112]  This is it.
[00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:50.653]  They've got all the seed.
[00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:52.847]  Central Bank Digital Currency is ready.
[00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:54.887]  They've got the central currencies ready.
[00:09:55.287 --> 00:10:05.891]  This is a historic moment, ending Bretton Woods, bringing in a global consortium run by the UN, run by the big central banks, to bring in a new global set standard.
[00:10:06.071 --> 00:10:09.813]  Very, very serious, and we're covering it live.
[00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:13.414]  But I want to illustrate something right now.
[00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:20.027]   that in international polls and national polls, upwards of 90% of people don't trust the government
[00:10:20.027 --> 00:10:21.106]  and don't like it.
[00:10:21.106 --> 00:10:24.846]   So this illegitimate system does not have the people's support.
[00:10:24.846 --> 00:10:29.846]  Here's Joe Rogan, just a few days ago, talking about that.
[00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:37.866]   So it's a very strange time where we, I don't think people have a lot of faith right now
[00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:43.126]   in institutions, and I don't think they have a lot of faith in authority.
[00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:50.447]   I don't think they really believe that there is someone who is wiser than them, that has a grand plan,
[00:10:50.447 --> 00:10:51.846]  that's logical.
[00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:56.977]  That's that's workable where they're looking out for all of us.
[00:10:57.417 --> 00:11:26.272]   So I think there's like a feeling of chaos that exists today that I don't think has ever existed in my life like this before even back during like the Bush administration when they thought you know, everybody thought Bush was a moron they they still thought There's a good cabinet and they're following all the checks and balances even though they're probably extracting too much money and there's probably a lot of cronyism and a lot of undercover deals and a lot of no-bid contracts with Halliburton and that kind of nonsense.
[00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:29.195]  He still thought they have things pretty under control.
[00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:30.896]  It's a very solid institution.
[00:11:31.217 --> 00:11:32.157]  Nobody believes that now.
[00:11:32.418 --> 00:11:33.619]  You see Pete Buttigieg.
[00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:37.540]  Kamala Harris and Biden can't get a sentence out.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.841]  This is madness.
[00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:40.621]  These people are utter fools.
[00:11:41.102 --> 00:11:43.022]  And these are the people that are running everything.
[00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:46.784]  And these are the people that are getting us on the brink of war with Russia.
[00:11:47.204 --> 00:11:49.725]  And I don't have any faith in them, and I think most people don't.
[00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:51.965]  But why is that being done?
[00:11:52.446 --> 00:12:01.489]  Because Kamala Harris and Barack Obama's third administration, or Biden, are puppets, fall guys, to take the fall.
[00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:03.929]  Which I told you two plus years ago.
[00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:05.510]  And that's where we are.
[00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.730]  That's why this is so dangerous.
[00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.812]  I want to play a clip that's all over the news that just happened two days ago.
[00:12:12.592 --> 00:12:14.253]  A robbery of a gun store.
[00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:21.155]  A man comes in with a gun to a gun store with men with guns on their hips and instantly gets killed.
[00:12:21.895 --> 00:12:22.795]  Now, why am I playing this?
[00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:24.996]  Well, it's the Darwin Awards, folks.
[00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:32.517]   And the globalists that we have running our society Radio listeners can't see this, obviously TV viewers can.
[00:12:33.598 --> 00:12:37.480]  Need to understand, our so-called elites are like an idiot robbing a gun store.
[00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:51.529]  Starting a war, a kinetic war, a nuclear war, it's where it's going with Russia, is the equivalent of robbing a gun store at noon, when you've got five employees armed, who are trained retired police officers, you're dead.
[00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.452]  You might kill one of them, you are dead.
[00:12:57.483 --> 00:12:58.764]  It's like attacking a police station.
[00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:05.049]  I mean, these people are in... It's like 100 Antifa last week came and just started trying to burn down a police station.
[00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.551]  I mean, they're just crazy.
[00:13:08.672 --> 00:13:10.693]  Or they know the judges are bought off, they're gonna get out of jail.
[00:13:11.034 --> 00:13:13.576]  Like the SPLC lawyer that was involved in the whole thing.
[00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:14.857]  $5,000 bond.
[00:13:16.198 --> 00:13:16.718]  It's insane.
[00:13:17.058 --> 00:13:18.720]  So I tie that into this next clip.
[00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:28.883]   This is the German foreign minister asked if there's any way Any chance of Ukraine being safe if Putin is still leading Russia?
[00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:35.425]  And she says, well, if Putin does a 360, then Ukraine will be safe.
[00:13:35.665 --> 00:13:37.466]  No, no, it's a 180, dumbass.
[00:13:37.906 --> 00:13:41.788]  Again, these people do not have two-dimensional thinking, much less one-dimensional.
[00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:46.830]  They certainly don't have two-dimensional.
[00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.231]  A 360 takes you to the same place.
[00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:50.432]  Let me draw a little diagram real quick for you.
[00:13:51.692 --> 00:13:53.733]  Here is a diagram, okay?
[00:13:55.057 --> 00:14:10.210]  So if you're right here, and Putin's right here, and this is a 180, so you want Putin to change where he's at, but you're up here and you say a 360, so you don't like where Putin is, you want to do him a 180.
[00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:19.649]   You want to do them a 180. You don't want a 360. A 360 takes you back to the same place.
[00:14:19.853 --> 00:14:21.874]  A 180 is at the 6.
[00:14:23.034 --> 00:14:23.414]  Watch your 6.
[00:14:24.395 --> 00:14:24.735]  This is a 12.
[00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:26.516]  This is where you want to be.
[00:14:26.796 --> 00:14:32.179]  You want Putin to reverse his policies, but the German foreign minister can't even understand that.
[00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:32.619]  Okay?
[00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:35.440]  You want a 180, not a 360.
[00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:39.542]  A 360 brings you right back where you were.
[00:14:39.602 --> 00:14:40.042]  Play the clip.
[00:14:42.704 --> 00:14:43.224]  Play it on the break.
[00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:49.819]  I've been asked before but I would still like to hear your answer.
[00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:58.702]  Is there any chance of Ukraine being safe in the long term if Vladimir Putin is still leading Russia?
[00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:05.684]  If he doesn't change by 360 degrees?
[00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:05.744]  No.
[00:15:09.677 --> 00:15:19.241]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[00:15:20.842 --> 00:15:24.624]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:26.404]  We will bring an end to it.
[00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:34.008]  But how will you do that exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control?
[00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:36.509]  I promise you we'll be able to do it.
[00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.671]  Tonight, sabotage at sea.
[00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:42.953]  That's what President Biden is calling the leaks and explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines.
[00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:52.179]  Like a boiling cauldron, the busy Baltic Sea bursting with gas from ruptured Russian Nord Stream reinforced pipelines.
[00:15:52.319 --> 00:16:06.387]  First on CNN, sources telling us that European security officials observed Russian Navy ships earlier this week in the vicinity of those leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines that were likely caused by underwater explosions.
[00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:07.187]  Here's what we know.
[00:16:07.368 --> 00:16:14.093]  We know that Russian support ships, Russian Navy support ships, were spotted in the vicinity of the leaks on these pipelines.
[00:16:14.113 --> 00:16:20.758]  We were also told by a source familiar with the intelligence that Russian submarines were spotted in the general area last week.
[00:16:20.878 --> 00:16:28.183]  I think this is clearly an act of sabotage of some sort and Russia is certainly the most likely suspect.
[00:16:29.184 --> 00:16:30.866]  It's incredibly alarming.
[00:16:30.987 --> 00:16:38.096]  President Vladimir Putin has blamed the United States and its allies for blowing up the undersea Nord Stream pipelines.
[00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:44.205]  It was a deliberate act of sabotage and now the Russians are pumping out disinformation and lies.
[00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:47.706]  If Russia wanted to shut off the pipeline, they would flip the button.
[00:16:47.726 --> 00:16:48.686]  They would twist the knob.
[00:16:48.726 --> 00:16:49.967]  They don't need to blow it up.
[00:16:50.067 --> 00:16:50.487]  It's theirs.
[00:16:51.007 --> 00:16:51.928]  It starts in Russia.
[00:16:52.188 --> 00:16:54.989]  So it was pretty obvious to us the Biden administration was involved in this.
[00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:57.489]  They have been lying to us all along about this.
[00:16:57.529 --> 00:17:04.672]  There's no way the United States was not either involved or knew about this or at the very minimum approved it.
[00:17:04.952 --> 00:17:06.012]  Today, a senior U.S.
[00:17:06.052 --> 00:17:09.753]  government official rejected a new claim by Russia's defense minister.
[00:17:10.074 --> 00:17:16.956]  He claimed that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb with Western help on its own territory.
[00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:22.557]  This is the first time the 101st Airborne Division has deployed to Europe since World War II.
[00:17:22.657 --> 00:17:38.127]   The idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews Just understand, and don't kid yourself no matter what y'all say, that's called World War 3.
[00:17:39.589 --> 00:17:40.290]  The U.S.
[00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:52.083]  will have to send their sons and daughters exactly the same way as we are sending their sons and daughters to war, and they will have to fight, and they will be dying.
[00:17:55.288 --> 00:18:01.291]  Air sirens blaring across much of central and eastern Ukraine today as Putin's forces ramp up.
[00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:06.013]  Washington has placed more than 8,000 U.S.-based troops on a heightened state of alert.
[00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:07.334]  Today, the U.S.
[00:18:07.394 --> 00:18:12.477]  sent in the cavalry bound for Romania right along the Ukrainian border.
[00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:16.636]   If we continue down this path, we may end up with a nuclear holocaust.
[00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:29.396]  [Music]
[00:18:29.396 --> 00:18:30.756]  CNN has learned that the U.S.
[00:18:30.853 --> 00:18:40.362]  is developing contingency plans for possible Russian escalation in its war in Ukraine, including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:18:40.682 --> 00:18:43.004]  Russian President Vladimir Putin today making it official.
[00:18:43.064 --> 00:18:48.689]  He just formally suspended Russia's involvement in its last remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the United States.
[00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:55.395]  The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.
[00:18:55.575 --> 00:19:02.374]   Every actuary, every historic war game, every analysis shows this leads to total thermal nuclear war.
[00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:06.775]  [Explosion]
[00:19:06.775 --> 00:19:12.774]  [Music]
[00:19:12.774 --> 00:19:14.774]  It's Saturday, March 11.
[00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:32.033]  We're now into hour number two, and General Flynn, a combat veteran, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and of course the top advisor to President Trump as the National Security Advisor, joins us commercial-free for the next 55 minutes.
[00:19:32.053 --> 00:19:32.874]  He's a very busy man.
[00:19:33.454 --> 00:19:34.956]  We appreciate him coming on.
[00:19:34.976 --> 00:19:37.960]  We're at an inflection point, a crossroads of crossroads.
[00:19:38.381 --> 00:19:41.164]  I asked him before he went live, just minutes ago, what he wants to hit first.
[00:19:41.204 --> 00:19:42.906]  He said, it's all interconnected.
[00:19:43.387 --> 00:19:49.354]  And so he's got an understanding of this from perspectives that really very few do on our side, the bad guys.
[00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:53.619]  Have lots of command and control experience, but this guy, they're definitely scared of him.
[00:19:53.639 --> 00:19:57.964]  If they weren't able to remove him, Trump would still be in office today.
[00:19:58.064 --> 00:20:00.647]  Everybody, even our enemies, agree with that.
[00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.509]  So we're going to look at Russia and the escalation there.
[00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:04.432]  We're going to look at the bank runs that have begun.
[00:20:05.212 --> 00:20:06.713]  We're going to look at the open borders.
[00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:08.634]  We're going to look at the January 6 bombshells coming out.
[00:20:08.994 --> 00:20:10.155]  The huge gain of function.
[00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:14.978]  Dr. Redfield coming out saying, no, it was basically run by Obama through Fauci.
[00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:16.158]  It was all illegal.
[00:20:16.218 --> 00:20:17.199]  It was gain of function.
[00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:20.221]  The deep state's in trouble, but they will strike back.
[00:20:20.301 --> 00:20:22.242]  So he's a very polite and humble man.
[00:20:22.762 --> 00:20:27.145]  But the time we've got him, I'm going to try as much as possible to just let him talk.
[00:20:27.725 --> 00:20:29.626]  Because if I jump in, he'll let me go forever.
[00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:31.107]  So General Flynn of General Flynn.
[00:20:32.807 --> 00:20:58.591]   We salute you and your family and all your supporters what we've gone through together, but you particularly we thank you for never backing down and We had lunch a few years ago, and then met again about a year ago And you kept saying if we don't totally push we're gonna lose in the next two years But I think it's safe to say we haven't won we haven't lost, but it looks like a lot of really good signals right now Everywhere that there's a huge Meltdown in the deep state.
[00:20:58.911 --> 00:21:00.893]  All their operations are being blown right now.
[00:21:01.213 --> 00:21:04.715]  But that concerns me because they're not going to give up without a fight.
[00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:10.719]  And I just said last week, I bet they do bank runs or a cyber attack to bring in their central bank digital currencies.
[00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:11.520]  Looks like we're there.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.181]  So you've got the floor, sir.
[00:21:13.201 --> 00:21:16.363]  You give us your overview and then we can drill into these different subjects.
[00:21:16.383 --> 00:21:17.004]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:21:17.947 --> 00:21:20.788]  Well, two things immediately.
[00:21:20.808 --> 00:21:34.215]  This year, and I've been saying this for quite some time now, I've been probably talking about this for the last year, that this particular year, 2023, I've been saying that it is going to have two transitions.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:41.158]  One of those transitions is the financial transition of the global economic system.
[00:21:41.518 --> 00:21:43.619]  OK, and I'll describe that here in a second.
[00:21:43.639 --> 00:21:48.701]  The second transition is the health system, the global health system.
[00:21:49.282 --> 00:21:52.263]  And Alex, in one of your in your lead into.
[00:21:53.007 --> 00:22:00.912]  You know, in the break when you were talking about some of the things that you're showing a clip of me there, you know, it's really I've been, you know, watching you off and on.
[00:22:00.932 --> 00:22:16.082]  But one of the things and I and I think it was like 2010 and maybe even then before that, maybe 2007, where you were talking about, you know, the health, the scares that they were that they were bringing forward.
[00:22:16.102 --> 00:22:19.425]  And maybe at the time that we might have had some bird flu or some Ebola.
[00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:27.572]   But I think the intuition that you had then To talk about where we are now, it was really prescient.
[00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:36.100]  I mean, it was really, really, you know, talk about visionary and understanding what was possible by our own government.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.544]  And frankly, you know, the deep state is not just these unelected bureaucrats.
[00:22:40.245 --> 00:22:44.367]  I mean, and we need to talk a little bit about that for your audience today, you know, who this deep state is.
[00:22:44.387 --> 00:22:53.230]  So we clearly define who the globalist elites are and where they exist on the planet, because it's not just in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.731]  They're all over the world.
[00:22:54.991 --> 00:23:05.435]  And honestly, the big push behind all of this, Alex, and for your audience, is coming from the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:23:05.615 --> 00:23:07.556]  So there's no doubt about that.
[00:23:08.248 --> 00:23:16.576]  And I know what their 100-year plan is, which essentially started in 1949, and they're executing it, and they're actually speeding it up.
[00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:17.317]  That's number one.
[00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:31.210]  And then the other part of that is that this idea, this notion of unrestricted warfare, in 1998-99 timeframe, I was in a military school at that time for one year, and I had the chance to meet the authors.
[00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.651]  Of the manual called Unrestricted Warfare.
[00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:40.613]  Two Chinese colonels that came over to the United States of America on a bit of an exchange.
[00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:48.755]  And I sat in and listened to them speaking about how they were going to fight this thing they called unrestricted warfare.
[00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:49.696]  And it's their doctrine.
[00:23:49.756 --> 00:23:51.116]  People can go find it online.
[00:23:51.196 --> 00:24:00.460]   But before we go into some of that, At the very tail end of the video that you showed prior to me coming on, you showed a nuclear explosion.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.181]  And one of the things that is, it is a major, it's a falsehood.
[00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:10.084]  And I want your entire audience and anybody that gets this piece of, that gets this clip to understand.
[00:24:10.104 --> 00:24:13.705]  There is no such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:18.955]  We will describe nuclear weapons and people will say it's a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:24:18.975 --> 00:24:20.676]  We're going to use tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:24:20.976 --> 00:24:21.977]  There's no such thing.
[00:24:22.437 --> 00:24:26.840]  That explosion that you showed right prior to me coming on, that's it.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.621]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:30.523]  That's the result of a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:24:30.823 --> 00:24:37.207]  OK, so don't think for a second that a tactical nuclear weapon is only going to blow up the hillside of a mountain.
[00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:39.909]  We can do that with a lot of other munitions that we have.
[00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:48.653]   But when we start to use tactical nuclear weapons, which which are Our administration has already talked about and I actually think when I when I look back
[00:24:49.378 --> 00:24:56.083]  If we really did the research, we were probably the ones first talking about the use of nuclear weapons and not necessarily the Russians.
[00:24:56.123 --> 00:24:59.625]  Although now both of us, both sides are talking about the use of nuclear weapons.
[00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:16.256]  Once we go to nuclear weapons and once that sort of, you know, when you when you talk about strategic bombers, which the Russians have already moved to forward operating bases and they start to strategically move them around to protect them, you know, as a security measure.
[00:25:16.696 --> 00:25:28.107]   We know that the Russian submarine fleet It's inside of the Black Sea and probably in parts of the Mediterranean.
[00:25:28.387 --> 00:25:39.558]  And I can tell you one other piece there that somebody, one of the media experts talks about was, you know, there was Russian submarines spotted in the area where the Nord Stream pipeline was blown up.
[00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:44.220]  You know, excuse my Irish, you know, to your audience, but that is total bullshit.
[00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:52.063]  The Russian submarine fleet up in the Baltic Seas there, they are so secret.
[00:25:52.663 --> 00:25:57.864]  And they know how to sneak in and out of there because they know they're always being tracked in and out of there.
[00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:03.226]  So they're not going to do something as dumb as what we are trying to say that they did.
[00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:09.268]  Just like I think one of the guys from your show, one of your members of your team said, all they got to do is just turn the spigot off.
[00:26:09.929 --> 00:26:12.853]  And once they do that, you know, because they're not suffering from it.
[00:26:13.193 --> 00:26:14.975]  It's going to be Europe that suffers from it.
[00:26:15.857 --> 00:26:18.620]  So there's so many things to unpackage here.
[00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:48.258]   One of the things I want to I want to start with is I want to start with because this is the here and now and you know this show on a Saturday you do these shows on Saturday sometimes and they're they're so important I mean and and this particular one because of what happened yesterday with this Silicon Valley Bank so let's just spend a little bit I'm not a I'm not an economic expert but I have I have enough expertise in financial warfare Right?
[00:26:48.358 --> 00:26:58.221]  And then the idea of what we do with our country and how we manipulate the various things going on in our country.
[00:26:58.241 --> 00:27:02.822]  And I clearly paid very close attention in 2008 to the collapse.
[00:27:02.942 --> 00:27:09.204]  And like I said, I joked with you guys off camera before we came on about, you know, you have some real experts with you.
[00:27:09.704 --> 00:27:13.406]  But I really think that people need to understand a couple of things.
[00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:14.766]  This is Mike Flynn talking.
[00:27:15.546 --> 00:27:20.035]  Number one, I actually think everybody needs to take a step back and take a deep breath.
[00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:21.538]  And I mean take a deep breath.
[00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:39.874]  And, you know, to a degree, I want to see how this particular administration responds to this, because the way that the Obama administration responded to the 2008 collapse was they basically paid everybody off and they let everybody off, okay?
[00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:58.946]   And right now, like just as an example, the CEO, the CFO, and the CMO, I guess the Chief Management Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer, For Silicon Valley Bank, they were selling their stock within, you know, within only the last couple of weeks, I understand, and maybe the last couple of months.
[00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:08.876]  Those three days before the head of... They ought to be arrested, they ought to be arrested, they ought to be thrown in the same clink that we're keeping these poor J6ers in.
[00:28:09.477 --> 00:28:10.697]  That's what they ought to do right now.
[00:28:10.757 --> 00:28:12.118]  Throw them in jail.
[00:28:12.158 --> 00:28:18.860]  Let them go get their high-priced lawyers and try to get them out on bail or bond.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:40.103]   But those three people, if they did that, and then they allowed their customers, and we're talking the numbers that I'm hearing, and I'm going to get us back to where I want people to take a step back because Because if people all of a sudden show up Monday or Tuesday and start to freak out, it's not going to help any of us.
[00:28:40.503 --> 00:28:42.304]  What I want to do is I want to put pressure.
[00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:45.604]  We need to put pressure on this administration right now.
[00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:49.585]  And by putting pressure on this administration, we're putting pressure on the deep state.
[00:28:49.885 --> 00:28:52.366]  We're putting pressure on the unelected bureaucrats.
[00:28:52.386 --> 00:28:58.787]  We're putting pressure on the institutions that handle this economic situation, this economic crisis that we are going through.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.700]  We're not in a military crisis right now, you know.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:08.642]  And again, we can spend a little bit of time on the military side because I do believe that we need to talk about what's happening in Europe.
[00:29:09.142 --> 00:29:11.602]  We need to talk about what's happening in the South China Sea.
[00:29:11.622 --> 00:29:13.443]  We need to talk about what's happening in North Korea.
[00:29:13.843 --> 00:29:21.304]  But right now, the American people, because I tell you, I just, you know, I'm one of these guys that goes around the streets here, right, in my own hometown.
[00:29:21.744 --> 00:29:23.825]  And I'm just, I'm in a regular hometown of America.
[00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:25.125]  I'm down in Florida.
[00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:28.066]  I'm asking people, so what do you think?
[00:29:28.086 --> 00:29:28.566]  What do you think?
[00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:28.986]  What do you think?
[00:29:29.007 --> 00:29:29.887]  I'm at the gas station.
[00:29:29.907 --> 00:29:32.268]  I'm at the, you know, the Wawa station.
[00:29:32.388 --> 00:29:33.329]  I'm at a 7-Eleven.
[00:29:33.369 --> 00:29:37.290]  I went into an office to go talk to some other people today, and I met and just asked.
[00:29:37.551 --> 00:29:43.333]  So I'm trying to get just a basic feel, an anecdotal feel, if nothing else.
[00:29:44.194 --> 00:29:44.894]  What do you believe?
[00:29:44.914 --> 00:29:47.695]  And they're all talking to me about how they're going to go take their money out of the bank.
[00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:48.916]  I'm like, let's wait a second.
[00:29:49.896 --> 00:29:55.139]  Let's just wait and see, come Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, because we're all going to be in this together.
[00:29:55.794 --> 00:30:06.381]  And what I want is I want the exposure, because the way we beat this globalist elite crowd, the way we beat the deep state, is we continue to expose them.
[00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:19.079]   I mean, one of the beauties of InfoWars, one of the greatness of your show, and you in particular, and I get all kinds of grief for Even saying that, Alex.
[00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:22.841]  What the great thing is, is you expose things.
[00:30:23.101 --> 00:30:26.784]  Good, bad, or ugly, you expose things.
[00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:33.268]  And that's how we bring evil out into the light, right?
[00:30:33.488 --> 00:30:36.910]  Well, General Flynn, let me just back you up, because we didn't talk before you came on today.
[00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.071]  We haven't talked to him, you know, months in person, but we're talking here live on air.
[00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:45.952]  One of my notes was to ask Flynn, how do we, how do we not let them stampede us into bank runs?
[00:30:46.332 --> 00:30:48.033]  Because they could have propped this one bank up.
[00:30:48.093 --> 00:30:50.533]  I said that, you weren't watching probably the start of the last hour.
[00:30:50.953 --> 00:30:52.954]  I said, they could have propped this one up.
[00:30:52.994 --> 00:30:58.695]  They're letting this create a domino and create fear to bring in their whole new system.
[00:30:58.715 --> 00:30:59.935]  So how do we thread that needle?
[00:30:59.996 --> 00:31:01.956]  And you already addressed that before I asked it.
[00:31:02.836 --> 00:31:13.570]   Yeah, so okay, and really what you're talking about is you're talking about, and for the people that don't know, to bring it to a source, I want people to go read Executive Order 14067.
[00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:25.453]  Executive Order 14067 signed by Uncle Joe the 8th of March of 2022 and it went into effect 13 December 2022.
[00:31:26.054 --> 00:31:27.714]  So just this past December.
[00:31:28.294 --> 00:31:36.317]  And there are already corporations and elements of our US government that are already beta testing what's called Central Bank Digital Currency.
[00:31:37.037 --> 00:31:38.417]  Central Bank Digital Currency.
[00:31:38.817 --> 00:31:40.458]  That's what that executive order is all about.
[00:31:40.818 --> 00:31:52.081]  Now, the Central Bank Digital Currency, there you go, and the Central Bank Digital Currency is already a global system, so it's already in effect, so to speak.
[00:31:52.101 --> 00:31:56.722]  The Chinese use it, they use this, you know, their yuan system.
[00:31:57.202 --> 00:32:02.147]  But this is a way to control whether or not you can spend the money that you actually earn.
[00:32:02.267 --> 00:32:06.751]  So, you know, and I'll just give a basic example of how far this could go.
[00:32:07.446 --> 00:32:19.450]  So you can go down to the gas station to fill up your car a second time in a month, and you put your card into the gas pump there, and the gas pump comes back and says, denied.
[00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:35.435]   And the reason it's denied is not because you don't have money in the bank, it's because this environmentalist crowd, this Nazi commune social whatever, You know, and I say communists, and the hard core of them are Marxists, and there are Marxists in the White House.
[00:32:35.535 --> 00:32:37.215]  It's a cult, it's a cult of power.
[00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:48.259]  Well, there are Marxists in the World Economic Forum, there are Marxists in the intelligence community, and there are Marxists in the Department of Defense and the Department of State, especially the Department of State.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:57.742]  And one other element there, because I do want to maybe spend a few minutes talking about the Department of Just Us or the Department of Injustice, however you want to call it.
[00:32:57.762 --> 00:33:02.323]  But this central bank digital currency, Alex, and I know you have spoken about this at times.
[00:33:02.863 --> 00:33:10.624]  Many others in the media, I would say others who wouldn't touch this in the past, are now starting to talk about this.
[00:33:10.664 --> 00:33:12.565]  The mainstream media is not talking about it.
[00:33:12.665 --> 00:33:13.545]  They won't talk about it.
[00:33:14.758 --> 00:33:15.979]  Because they're all in.
[00:33:16.419 --> 00:33:25.405]  But the other Fox, I think there's been one or two other guests there that have talked about it, because they're all in.
[00:33:26.245 --> 00:33:32.689]  But the other Fox, I think there's been one or two other guests there that have talked about it.
[00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.552]  I know that Glenn Beck has talked about it, but only recently.
[00:33:36.612 --> 00:33:38.753]  And I would say Glenn probably in the last couple of months.
[00:33:39.361 --> 00:33:53.209]  This is something that I know you've been talking quite a bit about, and I know I've been talking about this for the last couple of years, because once you control the economic system, you know, the global economic system, where now the U.S.
[00:33:53.469 --> 00:33:59.892]  currency is no longer the currency of choice for global trade around the world, because right now the U.S.
[00:33:59.932 --> 00:34:07.741]   currency is the currency of choice for global trade, And the English language is the language of choice for global trade.
[00:34:08.161 --> 00:34:10.082]  So that has been shifting.
[00:34:10.102 --> 00:34:12.623]  So how do we defeat it?
[00:34:12.663 --> 00:34:14.443]  Well, you know, what's going to have to happen?
[00:34:14.483 --> 00:34:16.624]  This is really to the people, right?
[00:34:16.684 --> 00:34:20.385]  Back to the people of not only your audience, but of this country.
[00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:32.369]  A couple of states right now are putting into bills, and I know that there's going to be at least one or two states that are going to have it as law, where they're not going to accept this form of currency.
[00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:44.831]  So the way to fight it back is expose it, understand it, make sure that we're talking about it, and make sure that we're talking about it with the right facts, the right formats, the right process, the right ideas.
[00:34:45.312 --> 00:34:47.874]  And then we have to talk about how do we stop it?
[00:34:47.914 --> 00:34:49.155]  How do we block and tackle?
[00:34:49.536 --> 00:34:51.117]  Because will it last forever?
[00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:51.617]  I don't know.
[00:34:51.637 --> 00:34:54.060]  I don't know how long we can last in this battle.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.043]  But in this particular battle, we can block and tackle a lot.
[00:34:57.523 --> 00:35:07.550]  By making sure that we push not only those in Washington, D.C., but I've said a lot of times, quit worrying about them if you can't worry about them.
[00:35:07.931 --> 00:35:12.274]  Worry about what you can do at your local level and definitely worry about what you can do at your state level.
[00:35:12.294 --> 00:35:17.898]  So I know of a couple of states, Oklahoma is one of them, who has got a bill going into their governor.
[00:35:19.229 --> 00:35:24.431]  And once that happens, and it's going to happen here pretty soon, because this transition is not going to happen on Monday.
[00:35:24.911 --> 00:35:26.532]  And that's my point about taking a deep breath.
[00:35:27.072 --> 00:35:27.932]  Not going to happen on Monday.
[00:35:28.172 --> 00:35:30.693]  This is going to happen over a period of time.
[00:35:30.733 --> 00:35:32.414]  They are trying to move it faster.
[00:35:32.814 --> 00:35:42.698]  They are trying to... Now I'm talking about the Chinese in coordination with the World Bank and in coordination with Klaus Schwab and team at the World Economic Forum.
[00:35:42.718 --> 00:35:45.099]  And General, let's quantify that in layman's terms.
[00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:51.123]  I agree, there's a giant alliance of traders in our government, the majority at the top, who are chi-com and want to end the dollar.
[00:35:51.543 --> 00:36:06.893]  They're using this bank fear, and they've said, and Biden on Wednesday put out his new plan for a central bank digital currency that removes the English language from the communication, which removes the dollar and makes it all digital, when right now communication's in English, which is a human intelligence program.
[00:36:06.913 --> 00:36:08.614]  What you're saying is very sophisticated.
[00:36:08.634 --> 00:36:10.175]  I don't want to be lost on people.
[00:36:10.435 --> 00:36:12.037]  Yeah, so now I'm speaking to the American people.
[00:36:11.977 --> 00:36:16.217]   us with these bank runs into accepting the central bank digital currencies.
[00:36:16.217 --> 00:36:21.256]   We want to prosecute the people that actually did this and control the contagion.
[00:36:21.256 --> 00:36:24.777]  Yeah, so now I'm speaking to the American people.
[00:36:24.777 --> 00:36:29.176]   So if the American people all of a sudden go on a bank run, then this government is
[00:36:29.176 --> 00:36:31.176]  going to turn right around and go, "See?
[00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:31.966]  Everybody's afraid.
[00:36:32.026 --> 00:36:33.167]  We have to transition.
[00:36:33.548 --> 00:36:33.828]  OK?
[00:36:34.209 --> 00:36:35.090]  And this is what we're going to do.
[00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:35.811]  And here's our plan.
[00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:37.072]  And we've already got it in place.
[00:36:37.573 --> 00:36:39.895]  You know, it's just like COVID, folks.
[00:36:40.296 --> 00:36:43.320]  I mean, some of the patents for COVID were back in 2015.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:54.048]   Some of the stuff that was developed In order to be ready when they wanted to use it, which was in early 2020, late 2019, early 2020, the patents for some of that stuff was back in 2015.
[00:36:54.689 --> 00:36:55.369]  You can't have a patent.
[00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:58.772]  A patent doesn't take, you know, it takes like 10 years to get a patent.
[00:36:58.952 --> 00:36:59.592]  They already had them.
[00:36:59.612 --> 00:37:02.995]  So now they already have this idea in place.
[00:37:03.355 --> 00:37:04.796]  I just mentioned the executive order.
[00:37:05.076 --> 00:37:07.658]  They're already doing some what we call beta testing.
[00:37:08.306 --> 00:37:17.153]  So if the American people can remain rock steady, and I mean remain rock steady, and place demands, be prepared, start placing demands.
[00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:29.082]  I'm going to tell you, if we start to raise our voices up and we raise them through shows like InfoWars, we raise them through some of these other people that are actually now getting it and now talking about it, believe me, they're... I agree.
[00:37:29.102 --> 00:37:30.003]  So what are the demands?
[00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:39.952]   We don't want The FDIC's Depositor Insurance Corporation is already saying this to pay people above $250,000 in central bank digital currency.
[00:37:40.092 --> 00:37:41.053]  They're already rolling that out.
[00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:42.294]  We have to say no.
[00:37:42.314 --> 00:37:44.877]  We have to pay it back via the Treasury.
[00:37:44.937 --> 00:37:50.542]  So no, no, no, no central bank digital currency response to this crisis.
[00:37:51.772 --> 00:38:01.196]  Yeah, I mean, so this government, our government, they can use bonds, they can use gold, they can use silver.
[00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:08.039]  They can back everything right now without saying we're going to go to some type of digital currency, right?
[00:38:08.379 --> 00:38:12.360]  We're going to accept a global system, which is total bullshit.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.102]  I mean, it is, you know, and I'm sorry that... No, it is total bullshit.
[00:38:16.682 --> 00:38:16.963]  It is.
[00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:20.648]  And so the other thing is, so that's number one.
[00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:25.295]  The second thing is, we must demand accountability.
[00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:32.425]  And I want to see that CEO, that CFO, that CMO, these people have to be held to account.
[00:38:33.058 --> 00:38:34.339]  They must be brought in.
[00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:36.881]  Because he knew it was coming, he jerked his money out.
[00:38:37.222 --> 00:38:38.803]  They knew it was coming, and there's many more.
[00:38:38.843 --> 00:38:41.846]  Those are just three that have popped up on the screen, right?
[00:38:42.206 --> 00:38:48.852]  Those are just three that have popped up on the screen, you know, that are going to be the faces of this thing, but there's many, many more faces and names.
[00:38:49.312 --> 00:38:54.697]  And so what we have to do is look at the totality of this, and let's not have any bailouts.
[00:38:54.917 --> 00:39:03.184]   If this government starts to bail things out, that means that We probably have lost this particular battle, folks, okay?
[00:39:03.385 --> 00:39:15.195]  That's why I say, it's like, you know, when somebody, early on, we have something in the military called rules of engagement, and it comes, it comes out of the very famous phrase, you know, don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes, right?
[00:39:15.655 --> 00:39:20.219]   And there's a Ranger manual, and there's all this kind of stuff about Rules of engagement on the battlefield.
[00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:21.720]  Well, I'm giving you a rule of engagement.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.042]  That rule of engagement is stay steady.
[00:39:24.443 --> 00:39:29.627]  And let's see what this enemy is about to attempt to do.
[00:39:30.207 --> 00:39:32.569]  And even when that happens, stay steady.
[00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:38.353]  Because what will happen is they will take total control of our lives, our government.
[00:39:38.514 --> 00:39:40.055]  So let's just jump for a second.
[00:39:40.635 --> 00:39:42.637]  Because that's financial.
[00:39:43.078 --> 00:39:46.521]  Unless you want to jump in and add anything else, let's go to the health side.
[00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:52.147]  Because in December, they had what's called the G20 Summit.
[00:39:52.667 --> 00:40:01.316]  And in this particular G20 Summit, there was only G19 because Russia decided to give them the Russian salute and not show up.
[00:40:01.356 --> 00:40:02.297]  And there's a reason why.
[00:40:03.141 --> 00:40:13.137]  One of the main reasons was because the keynote speaker at the G20 Summit, which is a big deal, and I don't expect your audience to have paid too much attention to it, but the keynote speaker there was Klaus Schwab.
[00:40:13.157 --> 00:40:14.739]  You know, hear Klaus Schwab?
[00:40:14.759 --> 00:40:17.043]  No, this is a real Council of Global Governance.
[00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:17.564]  This is key.
[00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:20.347]  Yes, this is key.
[00:40:20.647 --> 00:40:25.450]  And so when we talk about, so what is their cabinet, right?
[00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.991]  What does their staff look like?
[00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:43.000]  Well, their staff, somebody like a Klaus Schwab, their global staff looks like the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, organizations like the United Nations, organizations like the European Union.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.163]  Now, all those people in the media will go, oh, this is all belong to these... No, that's their tools of state.
[00:40:48.183 --> 00:40:48.826]  They don't have state power.
[00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:52.161]  They don't have world government summits admitting that they are the world government.
[00:40:54.795 --> 00:40:58.096]  So the World Health Organization, Klaus Schwab, G20 Summit.
[00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:08.719]  Klaus Schwab during the G20 Summit back in December, so only a couple of months ago, he made this big statement about the direction that the world needs to take.
[00:41:08.919 --> 00:41:14.881]  It was almost like a finger in their chest of the most powerful countries in the world.
[00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:17.842]  This is one of the reasons why the Russians didn't go.
[00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:22.782]  Putin and I because I do want to touch on Elon Musk here in a little bit.
[00:41:23.242 --> 00:41:31.567]  Putin has has made a decision, a very conscious decision, and he's no longer going to be part of this idea of the World Economic Forum.
[00:41:31.627 --> 00:41:32.748]  He's just he's done with it.
[00:41:33.108 --> 00:41:33.869]  He's done with it.
[00:41:33.989 --> 00:41:40.393]  And he's done with it because he sees that his civil, his, you know, that Russian society is threatened.
[00:41:40.714 --> 00:41:48.859]  But one of the things that came out of this Bali summit and our government just did a just did a little a little quiet kind of signatory of it.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.159]  is this World Health Organization Global Vaccination Card.
[00:41:53.159 --> 00:41:58.519]   Okay, so all those nations that attended the G19 Summit, they all signed off on,
[00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:02.200]   "We're going to have a Global Vaccination Identification Card."
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.159]  So what does that mean? What does that mean?
[00:42:05.352 --> 00:42:07.892]  Is that a stamp on your passport?
[00:42:07.993 --> 00:42:13.475]  Is it a plastic card that every single human being on the planet has to carry around?
[00:42:14.055 --> 00:42:28.602]   And so if I want to travel to a state, let's say I'm in the United States and I want to travel to a blue state, I want to travel to a state that's currently controlled By a Democratic governor, Democratic leadership, and let's just take the state of Michigan as an example.
[00:42:28.982 --> 00:42:37.948]  So if I want to go into Michigan, is Michigan going to now stop me, or stop me from buying products, or stop me from visiting my relatives in Michigan, or my relatives in whatever state that is?
[00:42:38.548 --> 00:42:42.992]  Because I can't cross the border or because I don't have my full vaccination.
[00:42:43.012 --> 00:42:45.974]  And what I'm telling you, folks, is don't get that damn vaccination.
[00:42:46.394 --> 00:42:46.895]  Don't do it.
[00:42:47.275 --> 00:42:50.858]  And so now I'm going to be, you know, labeled again a Vax Denier.
[00:42:51.198 --> 00:42:59.004]  I'm telling you, there's no or there's very, very few people in your audience and you have millions across the world that listen to you.
[00:42:59.265 --> 00:43:05.670]  There's very few people that have had as many vaccinations or shots stuck in their arms or their rear ends as I have.
[00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:11.873]  I have a list of shot record that goes probably 12 feet long.
[00:43:12.394 --> 00:43:14.775]  So, I'm not denying vaccinations.
[00:43:14.855 --> 00:43:31.045]   What I deny, what I'm against, is I'm against this murder weapon that we have called these vaccinations, these quote-unquote vaccinations, these jabs that they've been Given everybody, I mean it's undeniable.
[00:43:31.245 --> 00:43:32.186]  It is undeniable.
[00:43:32.386 --> 00:43:36.629]  So, I don't want to argue, you know, that particular... Well, that's a whole other subject.
[00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:38.310]  I don't want to get into that.
[00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.613]  What about the total vindication of all of us from the beginning three years ago?
[00:43:42.633 --> 00:43:44.494]  It's all come out, it doesn't work, it hurts people.
[00:43:44.514 --> 00:43:47.576]  You've got the former head of the CDC coming out saying it's a gain of function.
[00:43:47.596 --> 00:43:49.077]  Fauci and all them are running it.
[00:43:49.097 --> 00:43:52.820]  Yes, a gain of function, which means, a gain of function means weaponization.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.761]  Weaponization.
[00:43:54.101 --> 00:44:04.372]  One of the subordinate commands that I had was the National Intelligence Medical Command, NIMC, and it's up in, it's on the East Coast, okay?
[00:44:04.452 --> 00:44:11.280]  And one of the missions of them, so I went and visited these folks because they were a subordinate command of mine.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.043]  They were an organization that I was responsible for.
[00:44:14.898 --> 00:44:24.344]  And one of the things that they were responsible for was examining biological capabilities of other countries and how they would use them to weaponize them.
[00:44:24.865 --> 00:44:38.834]  So I have that background as well as other background on just intelligence aspects of my life that I got involved in that look at nuclear, chemical, radiological, and biological warfare, okay?
[00:44:38.874 --> 00:44:43.637]  So I have a fair background in this, more than I want to have.
[00:44:44.628 --> 00:45:07.667]  When we say gain of function, and when we talk about what was happening between different labs, right, in the different undergraduate and graduate level programs here, UPenn or Pennsylvania, Harvard was doing some stuff, MIT's been doing some stuff, and there's been other universities, particularly down in North Carolina, that have been doing some things in coordination with the Chinese government.
[00:45:08.908 --> 00:45:11.090]  So we can't, that's not deniable anymore.
[00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.592]  And we have people that must be held accountable.
[00:45:14.324 --> 00:45:20.627]  So the World Health Organization is imposing a global vaccination card.
[00:45:21.067 --> 00:45:22.587]  Our government is all for this.
[00:45:23.128 --> 00:45:26.469]  This digital central bank, digital currency, our government is all for this.
[00:45:27.213 --> 00:45:31.235]  So this is why I say we have to push back so much.
[00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:35.196]  When I tell people, they go, they say to me, what should I do?
[00:45:35.236 --> 00:45:35.757]  What can I do?
[00:45:36.397 --> 00:45:37.818]  I don't want you to go do a run on the bank.
[00:45:37.858 --> 00:45:39.538]  I don't want you to go take a vaccine.
[00:45:39.558 --> 00:45:50.983]   I don't want, you know, I don't want you to go run out and say, I got to go get a vaccine because somebody says we have the, you know, an H5N1 virus now breaking out in West Africa and it's going to You know, jump over the ocean to the United States right now.
[00:45:51.003 --> 00:45:54.864]  I mean, they're gonna try to put fear into us, okay?
[00:45:55.664 --> 00:45:59.826]  And you said it a little bit in the tail end of your last segment.
[00:46:00.586 --> 00:46:08.628]  One of the things that they fear, and they being this globalist elite, they fear what they cannot control.
[00:46:09.389 --> 00:46:13.170]  And so, for your audience, you're listening to somebody that they cannot control.
[00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:16.448]  Now, how might they deal with me?
[00:46:16.528 --> 00:46:18.689]  Maybe they'll just go, boom, and I'm done.
[00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:20.130]  I've had enough threats in my life.
[00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:31.356]  I know what sacrifice can be, and I know what sacrifice is to a degree, because I've experienced combat operations and such.
[00:46:32.077 --> 00:46:35.579]  I will tell you that we have people that have given their lives for this country.
[00:46:36.099 --> 00:46:39.240]  You know, over the years, throughout the history of this country.
[00:46:39.641 --> 00:46:47.944]  And so, we have to understand that... The point is, General, to interrupt you, you've made the commitment, and people need to make the commitment, that if you submit to this, things are far worse.
[00:46:48.364 --> 00:46:49.585]  The children deserve to stand up.
[00:46:49.605 --> 00:46:50.325]  We've got to take action.
[00:46:50.585 --> 00:46:51.626]  And listen, you're on fire today.
[00:46:51.646 --> 00:46:54.847]  You're always on fire, but I've never seen you on like this.
[00:46:55.167 --> 00:46:55.907]  This is amazing.
[00:46:58.312 --> 00:47:14.679]  I mean, I want to give you a lot of stuff, but I hope you'll do an overview, because I agree with you that the globalists set up China as their laboratory of control, it was then used to infiltrate us, now it's taking over the globalists to a certain extent, so it's a little bit of our military and government waking up, but I'd say that's a minority.
[00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:23.282]   I agree with you, who was the guy that went to Trump, before that went to Obama, and they admit was responsible for the pivot towards China.
[00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:35.828]  So you warned, you're the guy they admit, even the establishment does, that was right about China years before they double-crossed us, that warned the globalists, not as a traitor, you're like warning the government, which was run by globalists, they know you were right.
[00:47:35.908 --> 00:47:46.253]  You tried to get them to stand up, you've been vindicated long before Trump got in, and so you're a world expert on China and their hundred-year plan that we're now 60 years into.
[00:47:46.313 --> 00:47:55.078]   So if you please, please, Talk about the overview, the 100,000-foot view, because I think that's critical to understand what's happening.
[00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:04.605]  Yeah, so there is a no-kidding 100-year plan that the Chinese have had, started by Mao Zedong, you know, and now with Xi.
[00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:08.085]  Who's leading China now.
[00:48:08.125 --> 00:48:13.927]  He's only really the sixth leader that they've had in that 60 years, right?
[00:48:13.967 --> 00:48:18.328]  So they keep these guys, you know, they have leaders in there for a long time.
[00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:25.211]  And so they're able to do things as a dictatorship, as a communist dictatorship.
[00:48:26.191 --> 00:48:59.083]   To their society to move their economy to move their people and to and to take things and do them over a longer period of time instead of the madness that we you know that we currently go through with with back and forth back and forth with our with the you know everybody's I mean we have got to stop because we're right now we're in a we're in a crisis period And the Chinese, you might have shown it either a little while ago or on an earlier clip where you showed the South China Sea.
[00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:02.365]  So let's talk, first of all, alliances.
[00:49:02.946 --> 00:49:04.447]  Because I think this is really important.
[00:49:05.107 --> 00:49:19.537]  One of the things that's part of the Hundred Year War for the Chinese is to divide those who are allied with the United States of America, divide those alliances, and then build trust with the other side, right?
[00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:26.442]  Divide us from some partner that we had, and then they become their new partner, right?
[00:49:26.702 --> 00:49:27.643]  So how do they do that?
[00:49:27.703 --> 00:49:29.424]  They do that very shrewdly.
[00:49:29.844 --> 00:49:34.228]  They do that over time, and they've done that economically.
[00:49:34.988 --> 00:49:41.253]  I don't want to get into too much detail about the Belt and Road Initiative, which is a huge economic plan.
[00:49:41.273 --> 00:49:48.640]   It goes all the way from Really, from the South China Sea, the East China Sea, from the, you know, the port city of Delhi.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.302]  And doesn't the Ukraine war energize the Belt and Road?
[00:49:51.903 --> 00:49:52.423]  Big time!
[00:49:53.164 --> 00:49:53.785]  And bingo!
[00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:57.448]  So the northern part of that goes all the way into Europe.
[00:49:57.508 --> 00:49:59.470]  It actually goes through Ukraine.
[00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:00.611]  It goes all the way into Europe.
[00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:04.655]  And when I say into Europe, not just the mainland, but it also goes into places like London.
[00:50:05.215 --> 00:50:06.356]  And then you have the southern.
[00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:07.678]  These are big deals.
[00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:12.142]  And these are things that the Chinese have been putting together for a long time.
[00:50:12.663 --> 00:50:13.403]  Okay, a long time.
[00:50:13.764 --> 00:50:15.565]  And now they're moving it much faster.
[00:50:16.226 --> 00:50:19.229]  So the southern route from China, yeah, you have a great picture up there.
[00:50:19.489 --> 00:50:22.973]  The southern route is really a blue water route.
[00:50:23.633 --> 00:50:28.398]  But then it connects into Africa.
[00:50:29.539 --> 00:50:41.451]  Those blue lines now go all the way around Africa and they tie into places like Nigeria and the west coast of Africa, which are filled with resources, filled with commodities that the Chinese need to sustain their own people.
[00:50:42.071 --> 00:50:56.275]   Now one of the key points here, one of the big connectors, because you have a beautiful map up there right now, That line that goes from the Arabian Sea and it goes up through the Red Sea into the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean, okay?
[00:50:56.555 --> 00:50:58.297]  That's a big, big deal.
[00:50:58.697 --> 00:51:03.802]  The United States of America, we built the Suez Canal, you know, decades ago, right?
[00:51:03.842 --> 00:51:04.303]  We built it.
[00:51:04.623 --> 00:51:07.166]  Well, guess who built a second Suez Canal?
[00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:15.428]  And, you know, nobody will talk about this, but the Chinese went up there years ago during the Obama administration and they actually built a second Suez Canal.
[00:51:15.568 --> 00:51:24.830]  There is a second canal there with locks that allow ships to go up and up and through that very critical choke point into the Mediterranean.
[00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.171]  So those are alliances.
[00:51:27.211 --> 00:51:37.714]   In order for the Chinese to gain a foothold is they had to break alliances away from the United States And they had to then gain those alliances and they did that through Africa.
[00:51:37.774 --> 00:51:38.954]  They've done that through the Middle East.
[00:51:39.374 --> 00:51:41.875]  They've done that through Europe in a huge way.
[00:51:41.935 --> 00:51:51.459]  And of course, the two big alliances and one that just recently came is starting to show its skin, so to speak.
[00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:54.223]  There's a new alliance that's starting to grow.
[00:51:54.243 --> 00:52:00.774]  And that's the alliance, and this is a dangerous one for us, the alliance between China and Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:01.315 --> 00:52:02.677]  And I was going to ask you that question.
[00:52:02.697 --> 00:52:03.438]  That's in my list.
[00:52:03.919 --> 00:52:06.143]  And Saudi Arabia is suddenly making an alliance with Iran.
[00:52:07.139 --> 00:52:07.379]  Yeah.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:08.520]  So, yes.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.303]  So now, so you have these alliance, these are, you know, remember, right?
[00:52:12.403 --> 00:52:14.144]  I mean, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[00:52:14.204 --> 00:52:19.768]  So, China and Saudi Arabia just affected, really, an economic alliance.
[00:52:19.788 --> 00:52:20.949]  That's not good for us.
[00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:25.332]  China and Russia already have an economic alliance.
[00:52:25.732 --> 00:52:27.953]  China and Iran have an economic alliance.
[00:52:28.473 --> 00:52:30.394]  Russia and Iran have an economic alliance.
[00:52:30.554 --> 00:52:39.218]  Russia and many parts of Southwest Asia, which is basically the Arabian Peninsula, have economic alliances.
[00:52:39.818 --> 00:52:42.700]  Many of the North African countries have economic alliances.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:52.084]   Hell, the Chinese just built the largest mosque in the world on the coastline of Algiers In Algiers.
[00:52:52.204 --> 00:52:58.148]  I actually visited there years ago on a military visit.
[00:52:58.788 --> 00:53:00.989]  And I said, who the hell is building this thing?
[00:53:01.029 --> 00:53:01.670]  It's giant!
[00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.191]  It's a giant mosque.
[00:53:03.431 --> 00:53:04.751]  And they told me the Chinese.
[00:53:04.812 --> 00:53:05.612]  And I said, really?
[00:53:05.972 --> 00:53:08.854]  And that was almost 10 years ago, Alex.
[00:53:09.334 --> 00:53:13.797]  So the Chinese have been very shrewdly, and they've been doing this over time.
[00:53:13.837 --> 00:53:16.919]  So let me do a quick minute on what's called the BRICS.
[00:53:17.399 --> 00:53:30.766]   Because this has to do with economic It has to do with alliances and it has to do with everything else going on globally, particularly when we talk about World War 3, which we are smack dab in the middle of World War 3 right now.
[00:53:31.247 --> 00:53:46.615]  So the BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, those five nations have created basically a coordinating body, an economic coordinating body for trade and such.
[00:53:46.635 --> 00:53:47.556]  There you go, beautiful.
[00:53:48.326 --> 00:53:56.753]  And those four nations right there, leave that picture up, those four nations right there, they represent 47% of the global population.
[00:53:56.873 --> 00:54:00.697]  So half the damn planet is represented in those people, right?
[00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:03.519]  Those five leaders right there, right?
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:09.384]  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[00:54:09.924 --> 00:54:20.997]   There have been another, I would just say, another 10 countries that have recently moved, shifted, Over to join these, this element, this BRICS element.
[00:54:21.537 --> 00:54:25.401]  One of the more important countries that I paid attention to is which way the Saudis were going.
[00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:26.822]  And why is that important?
[00:54:27.303 --> 00:54:34.509]  Because in the world of, in the Arab world, you know, the Egyptians have a historic leadership role.
[00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.532]  And I wish al-Sisi would play a bigger role.
[00:54:37.552 --> 00:54:38.533]  And he does.
[00:54:38.613 --> 00:54:42.397]  And I have given al-Sisi, the leader of Egypt, a lot of credit.
[00:54:43.041 --> 00:55:08.281]   But the Saudis have an even greater role, particularly now with the way that they exist in the world, their access to the old petrodollars, their ability and not only their The relationship that they have within the Arab world, sort of the ideological underpinnings, but they also have a critical geo-strategic position on the planet, okay?
[00:55:08.321 --> 00:55:15.585]  So, where they sit, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, as I mentioned, as you showed in that other map.
[00:55:16.066 --> 00:55:20.669]  So, there's been a new move by the Saudis to align with China.
[00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:26.172]  So, when that happens, now we're talking about not just the Saudis, but there's a couple of other nations.
[00:55:26.232 --> 00:55:27.033]  Venezuela is one.
[00:55:27.828 --> 00:55:31.149]  Iran, we already mentioned, and there's a couple of others.
[00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:39.293]  These couple of other nations, with the BRICS, they now represent about 75% of the planet.
[00:55:39.793 --> 00:55:43.615]  And all of this has happened, so when I say 100 years, right?
[00:55:44.235 --> 00:55:53.680]  So there's been this this has been going on for decades and at the same time there's been this infiltration into our our body like a cancer, right?
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:56:03.204]   I mean our body like is like a is is right now has a cancer like in our education system in our You know, a lot of our institutions, our Department of Justice, right?
[00:56:03.584 --> 00:56:04.725]  So there's a cancer in there.
[00:56:04.925 --> 00:56:19.249]  And that cancer is part and parcel to the infiltration of people in the Democratic Socialist Party of America, in the Communist Party of America, and how they are influenced and supported by, frankly, the CCP.
[00:56:19.529 --> 00:56:36.167]   The CCP, I believe, made a very conscious decision back in the late 80s and the In the early 90s at the tail end of the Cold War when it looked like when Russia was basically the loser in the Cold War, China made a big decision to basically that they were going to rise.
[00:56:36.807 --> 00:56:56.304]   They then took that as their opportunity to say now is our chance and I could go through So many examples that are publicly available examples of how the Chinese have infiltrated every single institution of our society since the mid-90s, okay?
[00:56:56.504 --> 00:57:10.754]   And in particular, our education system, and they started at the highest level of graduate degrees and undergraduate degrees to the tune of No less than $100,000 a year, and they got up to at least $500,000 a year.
[00:57:10.774 --> 00:57:18.818]  Sure, and if we look at the ideology, General Flynn, of the left, it's very maliced how they're executing attacks against the U.S.
[00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:26.741]  So there's a, you know, different types of communism, right?
[00:57:26.761 --> 00:57:29.643]  There's the Chinese version, Russia has a version.
[00:57:30.083 --> 00:57:42.192]   America is going to be imposed, if we're not smart, there you go, if we're not smart, you know, there is an imposition of a type of socialism Being brought into America's society.
[00:57:42.612 --> 00:57:46.515]  And frankly, because people have asked me, well, Jesus, you know, these people are already there.
[00:57:46.615 --> 00:57:47.675]  They already have power.
[00:57:47.695 --> 00:57:48.656]  They're already wealthy.
[00:57:49.036 --> 00:57:50.117]  What the hell more do they want?
[00:57:50.397 --> 00:57:52.338]  They want more power, particularly power.
[00:57:53.178 --> 00:57:54.999]  And they want more wealth and they want your wealth.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.101]  So this is why we have to continue.
[00:57:57.121 --> 00:57:57.781]  And again.
[00:57:58.553 --> 00:58:00.195]  I want people to, you know, like me.
[00:58:00.755 --> 00:58:07.022]  I mean, I'm and I appreciate your team and the patience that you guys have had with me, you know, coming on today.
[00:58:07.042 --> 00:58:08.443]  But this is important.
[00:58:08.463 --> 00:58:11.186]  I mean, this is a, you know, this is exhausting.
[00:58:11.426 --> 00:58:13.388]  And Alex, you know how exhausting this can be.
[00:58:13.889 --> 00:58:14.650]  This is exhausting.
[00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:20.556]  And I want your because I'm being brutally honest with your with you, your audience and anybody else that listens to this.
[00:58:20.976 --> 00:58:23.277]  This is exhausting, but we have to do this.
[00:58:23.437 --> 00:58:25.758]  This is exhausting, but we have to do this.
[00:58:26.359 --> 00:58:27.159]  I do what I do.
[00:58:27.259 --> 00:58:27.999]  You do what you do.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:37.764]  Those people that are sitting in hometown USA right now that are listening to this or that will see this in the next couple of days, I want you to start thinking about what more can you do?
[00:58:38.522 --> 00:58:39.463]  What more can you do?
[00:58:39.803 --> 00:58:45.009]  And I'm telling you, I attended because I do stuff locally because I want to lead by example.
[00:58:45.509 --> 00:58:57.902]  So I attended a community hospital board meeting because it just so happens that in the county that I live in, there's only two county hospitals in the state of Florida that are owned by the taxpayers.
[00:58:57.982 --> 00:58:59.243]  I happen to live in one of those counties.
[00:58:59.644 --> 00:59:10.512]   So we tried to fill the The hearing up when they were trying to tell us about how they, you know, everything's wonderful and there's no problems here folks, nothing to see here, you know, nothing under the carpet, right?
[00:59:11.053 --> 00:59:15.957]  And we know that people went in there and died and the hospital made a ton of money.
[00:59:15.997 --> 00:59:19.960]  We're going to continue to put pressure at the local level on that hospital.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:23.062]  That's the Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
[00:59:23.522 --> 00:59:25.203]  I was about to ask you, what are solutions?
[00:59:25.223 --> 00:59:31.808]  You're saying, get informed locally, engage, because that's where the war is happening, and I want to have a few other issues at the time we have left, General Flakers.
[00:59:32.149 --> 00:59:38.133]  You've done a great job, so much to cover here, but bottom line, how do we quantify this?
[00:59:38.734 --> 00:59:42.837]  We know that the global, the Anglo-American establishment allied with China in 49.
[00:59:43.217 --> 00:59:48.121]  They gave them all the rarest minerals, they gave them all the jobs, they gave them internal tariffs against America, they set them up.
[00:59:48.701 --> 00:59:55.525]   We know that you briefed Obama and others, They told the truth and said China's about to take over, they're going to double-cross you.
[00:59:55.965 --> 00:59:58.626]  You were proven right, you were vindicated, that's why they're so scared of you.
[00:59:59.206 --> 01:00:06.950]  So there's kind of a schizophrenic thing with the elite, where they've invested in China, they're in bed with China, but China's now pushing them around.
[01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:15.654]  How do we get Western elites that are even still globalist to finally get the American people aren't the enemy, get off our backs, let's deal with China.
[01:00:15.714 --> 01:00:23.266]   But as you said, they have this communist inclination, there's so much Qaikom influence, Hollywood is literally trying to tear the country apart. We
[01:00:23.266 --> 01:00:29.176]   know four of the big six Hollywood Big production houses are owned by the Chai Koms. How do we
[01:00:29.176 --> 01:00:31.676]  get off the Chinese communist poison?
[01:00:31.676 --> 01:00:36.216]   Okay, so Part of this is what we know
[01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:40.235]   Again, because you've talked about it earlier in your previous segment. I
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.701]  I really appreciate that.
[01:00:42.301 --> 01:00:45.304]  There is a time to pray and there's a time to stand.
[01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:52.231]  OK, so it doesn't it doesn't mean that you can't pray while you're standing, but there now is the time to stand in that time.
[01:00:52.811 --> 01:01:11.597]  And when I say stand, I mean, I want people, and this is everybody, and there's a, you know, I'm trying to hit a target of people in this country that represent probably 50 million people that are sort of left of center, and they look at everything and they go, ah, no, no, this is politics as usual.
[01:01:11.857 --> 01:01:13.378]  This is not politics as usual.
[01:01:13.718 --> 01:01:18.979]  This is the existence of America as we know it is at risk.
[01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:20.960]  We are in a moment of peril.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.141]  We are in a moment of historic peril.
[01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:28.865]  So if you, you know, like people, I ask if you can't do anything else, say a prayer.
[01:01:29.245 --> 01:01:31.446]  If you can pray, don't pray.
[01:01:31.727 --> 01:02:05.496]   But if you can't do anything other than that, and maybe or maybe what you can do is you can send money into these different organizations that are fighting For us right fighting for for those that are that can't that don't want to put their Their head into the breach right that don't want to jump over the wall and say follow me I mean there's going to be those of us and frankly We'll never outspend the the enemy in this case, but we but we certainly can use the help So I just I throw that out there because that's important That's a that's an important aspect of being able to do the things that we need to do the third thing is
[01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:18.288]  I want people to start, and I want them to take a, you know, let 24 hours sink in and start to think, you know, talk to your neighbor, talk to your family, and start to think about what more can you do right where you're at.
[01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:22.952]  Maybe you pick up, you know, you pick up the telephone, you get on your phone, you start calling, you start emailing.
[01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.954]  I mean, go to these meetings.
[01:02:25.114 --> 01:02:30.558]  Don't sit there and say, ah, it's just all baloney, those politicians are all crooked and corrupt.
[01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:32.280]  They're there because we put them there.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.881]  And we have to change that.
[01:02:33.921 --> 01:02:34.821]  We have to change that.
[01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:36.402]  We have to go and get involved.
[01:02:37.103 --> 01:02:42.686]  I have talked to so many people over these last couple of years and I say to them, why aren't you running?
[01:02:42.766 --> 01:02:46.508]  Because they're telling me what needs to be fixed and this and that.
[01:02:46.548 --> 01:02:50.371]  And I'm looking at them and I'm saying, geez, you're a businessman, businesswoman.
[01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:51.792]  Why don't you get in there and run?
[01:02:52.312 --> 01:03:01.064]   And I have been able to convince A fair number of them to run for school boards, to run for county commissioners, to change the nature of the kinds of things that we are up against.
[01:03:01.104 --> 01:03:06.592]  Because I want our federal government to know that we the people, we're not going to put up with it.
[01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:11.961]  When they start to impose things, they're going to feel a tension coming from we, the people.
[01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:13.902]  And they need to feel that tension.
[01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:14.703]  They need to feel that pressure.
[01:03:14.723 --> 01:03:20.145]  So in military parlance, General, in military parlance, you're explaining everything is boots on the ground.
[01:03:20.165 --> 01:03:21.886]  Everything is every square mile.
[01:03:22.446 --> 01:03:25.568]  And so they'll never get away with this if the general public's mobilized.
[01:03:27.989 --> 01:03:29.910]  Yeah, and I'm telling you, you know, what would I like?
[01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:32.151]  I would like to, you know, this would be done peacefully.
[01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:34.012]  I would like to pick a date on the wall.
[01:03:34.773 --> 01:03:45.778]  Sometime in the next couple of months, maybe it's a 4th of July because it's a good date, maybe it's a flag day or maybe it's Memorial Day, and say, I want rallies at all 50 state capitals.
[01:03:45.898 --> 01:03:51.760]  I want thousands and thousands of people to go rally and just basically say, we've had enough.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.581]  You know, fix these problems.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:14.855]  But, now that I, and so I say that, I say that, because this is what they tried to do, that's why the January 6th happened, because they wanted to put the fear of God into every single red-blooded American out there that ever felt like they wanted to just go to the nation's capital and see it and peacefully protest, you know, and they went around trying to arrest grandmas, right?
[01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:15.776]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:04:17.217 --> 01:04:21.679]  So they did that purposely so these kinds of things, like I just said, won't happen.
[01:04:22.139 --> 01:04:28.162]  But if we go there and we do that, people are going to realize, and the governors, we have still, I think, 26 Republican governors.
[01:04:28.582 --> 01:04:38.166]  I mean, none of these Republican governors, I mean, some, I shouldn't say none, but few of them are really not changing the narrative on our elections.
[01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:38.887]  They really aren't.
[01:04:38.907 --> 01:04:41.528]  I mean, they're starting to push some of these systems out and stuff like that.
[01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:49.071]  But the bigger issue is we have to create tension at the bottom to those at the top.
[01:04:49.131 --> 01:04:53.293]  And when I say those at the top, the top might be county commissioners.
[01:04:53.394 --> 01:05:00.296]   The top might be, you know, clearly are your state legislatures who are probably in some cases So many people that are looking at this are your neighbor.
[01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.296]   So we've got to put the masks on the ground with the issues and the info.
[01:05:02.296 --> 01:05:07.296]   I totally agree. General, total genius interview today. We've only got like 15 minutes left.
[01:05:07.296 --> 01:05:11.296]   Let me then move into some of the areas listeners really want to know about.
[01:05:11.296 --> 01:05:13.296]  You've given us incredible information.
[01:05:13.296 --> 01:05:17.296]   As a former, you know, top Army general, a guy that actually ran things,
[01:05:17.296 --> 01:05:19.296]  you know, a lot of the generals just kind of sit around.
[01:05:19.296 --> 01:05:23.296]   You were a doer and a guy that actually warned the world about China,
[01:05:23.296 --> 01:05:24.936]  even got Obama to recognize it and actually change U.S.
[01:05:24.936 --> 01:05:25.296]  policy.
[01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:28.296]   That's a huge thing you did right there. That's why they respected you so much
[01:05:28.296 --> 01:05:30.296]  because you predicted they would double cross and they did.
[01:05:30.296 --> 01:05:34.296]   You did it as a loyal American, even though the globalists thought they controlled China.
[01:05:34.296 --> 01:05:38.296]   They literally feared you because you were over the horizon seeing it.
[01:05:38.296 --> 01:05:40.296]  What about Russia?
[01:05:40.245 --> 01:05:41.326]  Where do you see that going?
[01:05:41.386 --> 01:05:42.907]  Bakhmut falling to the Russians.
[01:05:43.728 --> 01:05:45.269]  Sure, the Russians have lost hundreds of thousands.
[01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:47.510]  They're fighting NATO, but they keep pouring more in.
[01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:50.793]  The threat escalation ladder keeps going up and up and up and up.
[01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:56.337]  You've got Zelensky and you've got his adjuncts, his defense minister, saying we'll use nukes.
[01:05:56.377 --> 01:05:58.679]  You've got other European leaders saying nukes are okay to use.
[01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:00.300]  They're clearly trying to push this.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.163]  Where did Biden go from six months ago saying we can't put in frontline battle tanks?
[01:06:04.183 --> 01:06:06.845]  That's World War III and the escalation ladder to doing it.
[01:06:07.545 --> 01:06:08.665]  Where is that going?
[01:06:08.906 --> 01:06:11.666]  What's your overall view on the Russia situation?
[01:06:13.027 --> 01:06:18.389]  Well, first of all, the war is a failure of politics, right?
[01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:22.130]  It's a failure of policy, and so that's number one.
[01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:26.171]   Number two, The Russians know how to know how to sacrifice.
[01:06:26.451 --> 01:06:32.435]  But believe me, I mean, as I've studied Russian history, I've studied, you know, the history of warfare.
[01:06:32.515 --> 01:06:33.835]  I've studied the Europeans.
[01:06:33.895 --> 01:06:37.398]  I mean, the Russians know how to sacrifice.
[01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:39.259]  And they're not losing right now.
[01:06:39.859 --> 01:06:47.864]  And the West, particularly the United States, we're supporting a fascist regime in Ukraine.
[01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:57.784]  And I always say this, you know, let's just say it's $100 billion that we have given to the Ukrainian government.
[01:06:57.824 --> 01:06:58.825]  God knows where it's going.
[01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:05.071]  We know that there's weapons that we left in Afghanistan that are now finding their way into Ukraine.
[01:07:05.091 --> 01:07:10.236]  $100 billion, if you divided $100 billion by 435 congressional districts in this country, that equals $200 million per congressional district.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:21.584]  Do you think that there's $200 million that could have been spent in every single congressional district instead of spending it over in the Ukraine?
[01:07:21.964 --> 01:07:23.084]  Nobody cares about that.
[01:07:23.364 --> 01:07:27.587]  No American, even though this president is going to say, Americans are all behind this war in Ukraine.
[01:07:27.847 --> 01:07:28.347]  No, we're not.
[01:07:28.387 --> 01:07:29.408]  We're not behind this war.
[01:07:30.188 --> 01:07:40.013]  Joe Biden has yet to stand in front of the American people and say, here are our three or four vital national security interests that we have.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.042]  Not one time has he done that.
[01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.003]  And war's not been declared.
[01:07:45.063 --> 01:07:46.404]  So should Biden, how do we stop it?
[01:07:46.444 --> 01:07:47.484]  Do we impeach Biden?
[01:07:47.785 --> 01:07:52.808]  And as you said, the New York Times did a big study and said, oh my God, the Russians now are behind the war.
[01:07:52.848 --> 01:07:53.748]  They were against it.
[01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:56.410]  As more Russians die, they get more pro-war.
[01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:59.352]  Well, I mean, anybody that studies, anybody knows that.
[01:07:59.392 --> 01:08:01.353]  The British in World War II or the Russians.
[01:08:01.613 --> 01:08:03.214]  I mean, the Russians are only getting more pissed.
[01:08:03.755 --> 01:08:05.276]  So where do you see this going?
[01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:18.346]  Well, plus if the Russians were losing so badly, which is the narrative that we're being told, why do we have to keep flowing money and troops and all kinds of intelligence and everything into Ukraine?
[01:08:18.406 --> 01:08:20.828]  I mean, it's because the Russians aren't losing.
[01:08:20.868 --> 01:08:23.670]  This is a loser's war.
[01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:28.314]  This is a loser's war, and everybody's going to lose.
[01:08:28.975 --> 01:08:30.536]  And we're going to lose big time.
[01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:32.958]  We are going to use this as an excuse.
[01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:44.930]  So we now, the United States government, this administration, specifically those in the White House, are going to use this war as an excuse to do this financial transition and this health transition this coming year.
[01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:46.151]  That's what I believe.
[01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:49.272]  And they're going to use war to do it.
[01:08:49.713 --> 01:08:54.695]  Because war is a great excuse when everything else around you is failing.
[01:08:55.336 --> 01:09:03.900]  And right now, the exposure of the globalist elite and what they are attempting to do to take over the world.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.481]  I'm not kidding when I say this.
[01:09:07.922 --> 01:09:21.146]  Don't think for one second, folks, that they're going to wake up tomorrow morning and go, you know what, we've just simply, we've screwed the American people too much, let's turn on our energy, let's close the border, let's hold people accountable.
[01:09:21.606 --> 01:09:21.766]  No.
[01:09:22.187 --> 01:09:23.227]  They're going to triple down.
[01:09:23.427 --> 01:09:24.487]  They are going to triple down.
[01:09:24.507 --> 01:09:26.868]  Well, General, that was my first question I meant to get to.
[01:09:26.928 --> 01:09:27.568]  Let me ask you that.
[01:09:28.088 --> 01:09:39.993]   When in history have you seen an elite that runs a powerful, world-dominant country Undermine its dollar, undermine its borders, undermine its people, poison its people, create race war, cut off its pipelines.
[01:09:40.794 --> 01:09:44.996]  So the globalists are at war with America that they've gotten a war with Russia.
[01:09:45.116 --> 01:09:47.957]  Why are they attacking their own power base?
[01:09:50.758 --> 01:09:58.722]  Yeah, and so I'll just, you know, I'll say that no country that lost its character ever kept its liberty, okay?
[01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:06.285]  And so the character of the United States of America is in the DNA of every single American.
[01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:08.748]  And I want every single American to understand that.
[01:10:09.168 --> 01:10:12.272]  That in our DNA is the idea of freedom.
[01:10:13.018 --> 01:10:17.483]  And the idea of respect and the idea of what my father taught me, right?
[01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:19.745]  Treat others like you like to be treated.
[01:10:19.785 --> 01:10:21.026]  That's called the golden rule.
[01:10:21.647 --> 01:10:25.010]  And until you treat me differently, that's the way I'm going to treat you.
[01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:29.675]  And once you start treating me differently, especially as an American, we know how to fight back.
[01:10:29.755 --> 01:10:31.117]  We might get bloodied.
[01:10:31.637 --> 01:10:56.927]   You know on the on the in the first battle it's a very it was a very famous book called America's first battles where that where the where the blood runs from Americans first until we you know get off our knees and stand up and realize we better we better get into the fight and when we do you know Katie bar the door because we're gonna we're going to win and so what I do know is that We have not lost our character as a nation yet.
[01:10:57.487 --> 01:11:06.670]  They are trying their damnedest by flooding the country with illegals, by stuffing down the throats of our children this fentanyl and some of these other drugs.
[01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:12.772]  I mean, they're trying their damnedest to destroy the fabric of our society, to destroy our culture.
[01:11:13.232 --> 01:11:18.658]  And I want people to understand, again, that no country that lost its character ever kept its liberty.
[01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:20.540]  And they're going to try to destroy that.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.263]  So we have to take a stand.
[01:11:23.303 --> 01:11:26.886]  We have to understand that, you know, the idea of nothing.
[01:11:27.267 --> 01:11:32.112]  Don't believe for a second that anything is going to be handed to you, right?
[01:11:32.172 --> 01:11:32.792]  People know that.
[01:11:33.033 --> 01:11:38.779]   People that work hard, They know that nothing comes without sacrifice, right?
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:47.923]  And so it's going to take sacrifice for us to be able to elevate ourselves and to push back and to get healthy.
[01:11:47.963 --> 01:11:48.943]  It's like a body, right?
[01:11:48.963 --> 01:11:50.224]  We got to get back into shape.
[01:11:50.284 --> 01:11:52.024]  I want America to get back into shape.
[01:11:52.265 --> 01:11:59.567]  And the way that we're going to get back into shape is by more and more people standing up and speaking up and standing firm and never giving up.
[01:11:59.927 --> 01:12:09.025]   I mean, you know, if I want to be an example of anything, Because I always looked at what was happening to me and the persecution that I went through.
[01:12:09.045 --> 01:12:10.886]  This was really not about me.
[01:12:10.906 --> 01:12:12.467]  This was about America.
[01:12:12.548 --> 01:12:17.091]  I mean, yeah, they attacked Mike Flynn, but they were attacking the country.
[01:12:17.191 --> 01:12:27.120]  They were getting rid of somebody who knew a lot about what was going on and could have stopped a lot of what happened over the four years of the Trump administration.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:33.145]  And frankly, I could be Trump's worst nightmare, but I'm not, because he didn't really know.
[01:12:33.245 --> 01:12:38.969]  Even he, as smart as he is, he was naive to think that what these people were doing, they were actually going to do.
[01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.730]  And they did.
[01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:40.811]  And they did.
[01:12:41.852 --> 01:12:43.013]  General Flynn, let me say this.
[01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:46.896]  In the five, six minutes we have left, because I know you're busy, but this is an amazing interview.
[01:12:47.848 --> 01:12:49.510]  You mentioned January 6th earlier.
[01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:53.954]  Elon Musk calls for Q Shaman, who it turns out they let in, let in the Senate.
[01:12:54.214 --> 01:12:55.235]  He told people to leave.
[01:12:56.036 --> 01:12:57.377]  He's spending four years in jail.
[01:12:57.758 --> 01:12:59.219]  Elon Musk says release him.
[01:12:59.559 --> 01:13:01.041]  We got documents four days ago.
[01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:05.265]  They're now all over the news that the FBI suppressed documents of the Proud Boys trial.
[01:13:05.285 --> 01:13:07.747]  They were actually running the attack on the Capitol.
[01:13:08.536 --> 01:13:15.801]  They're so scared of January 6th because they're branding the American people as terrorists and trying to turn the whole national security apparatus against us.
[01:13:16.262 --> 01:13:18.904]  That's falling apart ahead of the CDC, as we mentioned earlier.
[01:13:19.284 --> 01:13:20.705]  But then you said, I'll get back to that later.
[01:13:20.745 --> 01:13:21.485]  Can you speak to that?
[01:13:21.966 --> 01:13:24.908]  I mean, to have Redfield out saying, gain of function, this happened.
[01:13:24.928 --> 01:13:25.588]  I want to explain this.
[01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:35.696]  He's saying, look, leadership of the military, but that's under globalist control because we know Obama, even when Trump got in, never got full control.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:39.883]  So I'm not saying China isn't involved in the attack, but it's one level.
[01:13:39.923 --> 01:13:44.026]  First they say it's China, but it's globalist, but above that it's globalist with China.
[01:13:44.706 --> 01:13:49.290]  Looking at that, because now Congress has bills saying China launched the attack, I hate the CHICOMs.
[01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:59.897]  And I know they want to attack us, and I know they wrote papers about bioweapons against us, but their allies are going to pose inside the government as if that was the CHICOMs doing it.
[01:14:00.218 --> 01:14:18.030]   I think the globalists are just as guilty as the CHICOMs, and that CHICOM globalists Combine must be identified so that the general American people don't think our government did this I think we have to educate people that a criminal group with China Released the virus and the shots to collapse our civilization.
[01:14:18.391 --> 01:14:20.072]  So how do we explain that complex issue?
[01:14:21.433 --> 01:14:38.511]   Yeah, so first of all don't don't allow anybody and I'm talking to your entire audience Don't allow anybody to call you a conspiracy theorist and I'm not talking about you Alex Jones I'm talking about you as an individual who I'm speaking to right now and You know, don't allow anybody to label you as anything other than who you are as a person.
[01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:40.031]  You define yourself, number one.
[01:14:40.472 --> 01:14:42.552]  The second thing is, is there is a relationship.
[01:14:42.592 --> 01:14:49.975]  It is a clear, a clear relationship between the Chinese Communist Party leadership, particularly Xi and his team.
[01:14:50.015 --> 01:14:51.136]  He's got a very small team.
[01:14:52.036 --> 01:15:01.539]  Of individuals who support every single thing that they're doing and this globalist group of people, you know, sort of by the face of them is the World Economic Forum.
[01:15:01.579 --> 01:15:04.519]  That's Klaus Schwab and that's people like George Soros.
[01:15:04.539 --> 01:15:06.060]  There's Bill Gates is involved in this.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.060]  I mean, there's there is a body of them.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.200]  You can go look at their website.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.461]  They're so public about it.
[01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:11.241]  It's insane.
[01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:24.906]  And they have this other advisor, Yuval Noah Harari, who they float around this country and they float around the world talking about how people are going to be machines and that God is something in the clouds and now God is in Silicon Valley.
[01:15:24.926 --> 01:15:27.447]  I mean, these people are psychopaths, all of them.
[01:15:28.527 --> 01:15:33.015]   And the other thing is that you're going to hear people in our own government Particularly the State Department.
[01:15:33.475 --> 01:15:35.636]  Oh, China's not our enemy, China's our competitor.
[01:15:35.696 --> 01:15:36.176]  Bullshit!
[01:15:36.556 --> 01:15:37.857]  China is our adversary.
[01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:39.718]  China wants global domination.
[01:15:40.078 --> 01:15:45.701]  They see this century, back to the Hundred Year War, they see this century as the Chinese century.
[01:15:46.662 --> 01:15:52.225]  Last year might have been the American century, this year is going to be the Chinese century, and they have already begun.
[01:15:53.044 --> 01:15:54.045]  To dominate, right?
[01:15:54.405 --> 01:15:56.326]  I mentioned relationships with Saudi Arabia.
[01:15:56.346 --> 01:15:57.827]  I mentioned... And these are economic relationships.
[01:15:57.847 --> 01:15:58.447]  These are real things.
[01:15:58.467 --> 01:15:59.227]  People can go read them.
[01:15:59.648 --> 01:16:00.108]  Read about them.
[01:16:00.148 --> 01:16:01.128]  Don't just believe them.
[01:16:01.148 --> 01:16:02.289]  Sure, so the shift is happening.
[01:16:02.329 --> 01:16:03.050]  How do we stop that?
[01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:03.650]  They're not military.
[01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:04.530]  How do we stop that?
[01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:05.371]  Mass awakening?
[01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:06.271]  Political awareness?
[01:16:08.553 --> 01:16:10.414]  Yeah, I mean, this... Honestly...
[01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:28.336]  I don't want to think of the worst case, because as an intelligence officer, in my years of being on the battlefield, we would go worst case, best case, most likely, most probable, the kinds of things happening in the middle.
[01:16:29.057 --> 01:16:40.201]  The most probable right now for me, what we really need to be doing right here in our country, and I keep going back to it, is I call it local action will have a national impact.
[01:16:40.941 --> 01:16:42.321]  And people go, ah, that's not good.
[01:16:43.242 --> 01:16:45.062]  Because the people in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:45.102 --> 01:16:48.603]  I mean, the Weaponization Subcommittee should have already issued 500 subpoenas.
[01:16:48.903 --> 01:16:50.243]  No, it's just, let me stop you.
[01:16:50.263 --> 01:16:51.444]  Let me leave that to you.
[01:16:51.544 --> 01:16:53.524]  It was doctors and scientists and others.
[01:16:53.904 --> 01:16:56.065]  It was locals, nurses, doctors saying no.
[01:16:56.085 --> 01:16:58.145]  It was people at city council saying no.
[01:16:58.465 --> 01:17:01.166]  The feds are so scared of people at school boards saying no.
[01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:05.487]  The critical race theory and drag queen pedophile time and all the rest of it.
[01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:09.208]  It really is us not submitting is what defeats the system.
[01:17:11.463 --> 01:17:18.966]  It's the one mom that stands there and gets her three minutes in front of a school board and dresses them down, okay?
[01:17:19.226 --> 01:17:30.650]  It's the father who goes in front of a school board or a committee and dresses them down because his daughter was just raped by a boy who was allowed to go into the girls' room.
[01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:36.572]  And that actually happened up in Virginia.
[01:17:36.933 --> 01:17:38.473]  He raped two girls in Virginia?
[01:17:42.748 --> 01:17:48.033]  Yeah, there was two assaults that I'm aware of, but it's that one mom.
[01:17:48.474 --> 01:18:01.885]   I look at a crowd of 5,000 people when I'm out speaking in different places, and I look around as I'm trying to get my points across to the audience, and I say to the audience, I don't need all of you to go out and do that.
[01:18:01.925 --> 01:18:03.086]  I just, I'm looking for one.
[01:18:03.666 --> 01:18:04.486]  I'm looking for one.
[01:18:04.786 --> 01:18:06.287]  Because sometimes that's all it takes.
[01:18:06.647 --> 01:18:07.567]  It takes one place.
[01:18:07.587 --> 01:18:09.748]  But what if, what if, what if 20%?
[01:18:09.788 --> 01:18:11.708]  What if, imagine if everybody just mobilized.
[01:18:11.808 --> 01:18:12.289]  Exactly.
[01:18:12.909 --> 01:18:13.289]  It's over.
[01:18:13.809 --> 01:18:15.009]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:18:15.269 --> 01:18:28.313]   I mean, like I say, I mean, I would love to have leaders in all the states that we have I mean, in all 50 states, but certainly maybe there's some more important states politically, you know, from an election perspective.
[01:18:28.614 --> 01:18:30.874]  But maybe we have, you know, maybe we have giant rallies.
[01:18:30.934 --> 01:18:34.335]  I mean, we've got to mobilize the, you know, we the people, right?
[01:18:34.956 --> 01:18:41.338]  And you can mobilize when there's a school board hearing, you can mobilize when there's a county commission hearing, you can when there's an open seat.
[01:18:41.938 --> 01:18:54.942]   I can tell you that there are there are hundreds of thousands of volunteer positions that are still unfilled because the American people And I hate to say it, folks, but we've been lazy and apathetic as a society over the last 20, 30 years.
[01:18:55.342 --> 01:19:01.664]  And we've let the, you know, all this gripe and I've heard all this, you know, BS about all those politicians are all corrupt.
[01:19:01.965 --> 01:19:02.885]  Well, it's our fault.
[01:19:03.345 --> 01:19:04.345]  We've been putting them in there.
[01:19:04.385 --> 01:19:05.306]  So we got to stop that.
[01:19:05.706 --> 01:19:07.646]  General Flynn, I totally agree.
[01:19:07.686 --> 01:19:09.487]  In a few minutes, GeneralFlynn.com.
[01:19:09.947 --> 01:19:10.848]  Few minutes we have left.
[01:19:10.988 --> 01:19:11.908]  Big picture, though.
[01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:13.835]  I'm optimistic.
[01:19:13.955 --> 01:19:14.996]  I see a huge awakening.
[01:19:15.036 --> 01:19:17.457]  I see all these talk show hosts that were scared now telling the truth.
[01:19:17.977 --> 01:19:23.619]  I see all these hearings where gain-of-function is coming out and the illegal spy combine with all these agencies.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.741]  I mean, things are a lot better than they were two years ago.
[01:19:26.781 --> 01:19:31.643]  It seems like the awakening curve, the educational curve, is going straight up right now.
[01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:34.844]  In closing comments, you've got the last five minutes, you've got the floor.
[01:19:35.224 --> 01:19:37.525]  Other key points you'd like to add, I really want to thank you for your time.
[01:19:38.889 --> 01:19:39.729]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[01:19:39.769 --> 01:19:41.230]  And thank you to your great audience.
[01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:45.072]  And thank you for just being, you know, I say courage is a decision.
[01:19:45.092 --> 01:19:48.994]  It becomes contagious after you make a decision to be courageous.
[01:19:49.594 --> 01:19:54.116]  And I appreciate the decision that you made to continue to be courageous for this country.
[01:19:55.597 --> 01:19:57.478]  So it kind of big picture.
[01:19:57.898 --> 01:20:05.161]  I actually see things in a very, you know, very, like, lit or lighted way.
[01:20:05.221 --> 01:20:06.682]  I have my path is lighted.
[01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:10.892]  And part of it is because I have a very strong basis of faith.
[01:20:11.033 --> 01:20:13.179]  So I, you know, like God wins, right?
[01:20:14.222 --> 01:20:15.182]  And I believe that.
[01:20:15.202 --> 01:20:21.264]  I don't wear it on my sleeve, but the path in front of me is a very bright path.
[01:20:21.404 --> 01:20:27.486]  And it's bright because of what I tried to address earlier, what is in the character of each one of us.
[01:20:28.226 --> 01:20:39.609]  And I believe strongly, in fact, what's in the character of every American is we're not going to allow this country to be stolen from us in plain sight.
[01:20:40.289 --> 01:20:41.550]  And how we're going to do that.
[01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.391]  We're going to create alternative ideas.
[01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:45.971]  We're going to create alternative paths.
[01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:52.093]  We, like a lot of these doctors, have already started to stand up other alternative medical capabilities.
[01:20:52.753 --> 01:20:59.816]  I think this banking crisis that we're involved in right now, I actually think that we're going to see a lot of good come out of this.
[01:21:00.616 --> 01:21:29.084]  But part of what the government, and we need to demand this, we need to demand that people are held accountable, don't start closing banks, don't start making a run, take a deep breath, be steady, there's got to be accountability, but all these things are going to start to happen, and they're going to happen even more so, because we're going to continue to expose these bastards, and they need to be exposed, and the more we expose them, like guys like Fauci, he's the face of this disastrous, murderous, you know, COVID nightmare that the world went through, right?
[01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:34.762]  So we have to hold these people accountable, and we have to demand that they be held accountable.
[01:21:35.222 --> 01:21:44.427]  And I think that that exposure, the education, the understanding of who these globalist elites are, who they are, are really important.
[01:21:44.447 --> 01:21:49.910]  And I think, you know, I'm going to put a plug in here because you're showing my Twitter site there.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.901]  Um, for Elon.
[01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:52.902]  Elon Musk.
[01:21:53.402 --> 01:21:55.564]  I actually think, you know... General, you've got to stop.
[01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:56.405]  This is incredible.
[01:21:56.485 --> 01:21:59.767]  My last question was, what do you make of Elon Musk?
[01:21:59.888 --> 01:22:01.108]  I mean, I judge three by its fruits.
[01:22:01.129 --> 01:22:03.350]  I don't trust him, but man, is he kicking their ass.
[01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:08.855]  I was about to ask you, will you call on Elon Musk to take... What would General Flynn say to Elon Musk?
[01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:09.896]  We should get you guys together.
[01:22:10.016 --> 01:22:10.276]  Sorry.
[01:22:10.536 --> 01:22:11.177]  This is incredible.
[01:22:11.237 --> 01:22:12.778]  My next thing was, was Elon Musk.
[01:22:13.948 --> 01:22:18.976]  Yeah, well, I actually think that Elon Musk is doing a service for the world.
[01:22:19.537 --> 01:22:27.971]  Now, you know, I met Elon Musk briefly a number of years ago, whether or not he remembers that meeting, but it was a good meeting, actually.
[01:22:29.506 --> 01:22:48.217]  So what Elon Musk is doing for the world right now is he's opening up and exposing like I mean like we've never seen exposed the the deepest of it and darkest of the of the state that exists right this deep state and this is not just America we're learning a lot of things about America.
[01:22:48.857 --> 01:22:53.642]  You know, one of the things, and you could put it on there, is this Schellenberger report.
[01:22:53.782 --> 01:22:56.384]  Schellenberger is one of the guys that did the Twitter files.
[01:22:56.965 --> 01:23:04.712]  I read excerpts from his, it's about a 60-some page document, or maybe longer, I read excerpts of it from it.
[01:23:05.393 --> 01:23:16.658]  You know, what Elon is doing, yeah, this is another one, this guy right here, Kramer, he, Kramer says, hey, you gotta go invest in Silicon Valley Bank only a couple of weeks ago, and they're collapsed.
[01:23:16.678 --> 01:23:22.821]  That guy, right there, he did the same thing in 2007, so I'm sorry, I'm on a tangent.
[01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:25.923]  No, no, I was gonna play that clip too, it's insane.
[01:23:26.343 --> 01:23:31.225]  He obviously, when a group's about to go down, he tries to get new investors in, so the big guys can get out.
[01:23:31.305 --> 01:23:32.306]  He should be investigated.
[01:23:35.174 --> 01:23:40.839]  He should be thrown off the T, whatever the station is, he should be booted off, he should be hard and feathered, right?
[01:23:40.919 --> 01:24:00.795]  I mean, so anyway, but what, Elon, Elon is doing a service for the world and he's definitely doing a great service for this country because what he's showing is he's showing how the federal government has weaponized every single aspect of our government to go against the American people.
[01:24:01.615 --> 01:24:03.097]  That's what, that's what this is.
[01:24:04.111 --> 01:24:07.433]  I mean, and that's part of World War III.
[01:24:07.854 --> 01:24:15.679]  You know, I talk, on my website, GeneralFlynn.com, we have a book called The Citizen's Guide to Fifth Generation Warfare.
[01:24:16.139 --> 01:24:17.400]  I could have a whole show on that.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:32.450]  I mean, we are in this moment of time where our overreaching, institutionalized, and weaponized federal government is at, you know, it's like World War I trenches, trench warfare, and they're against us!
[01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:34.771]  But they know that they can't beat us.
[01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:36.692]  They know that we overwhelm them.
[01:24:36.732 --> 01:24:40.034]  We overwhelm them in every other aspect of all the things that I've already talked about.
[01:24:40.315 --> 01:24:41.735]  And we have to keep doing that.
[01:24:42.096 --> 01:24:43.617]  We have to keep placing demand.
[01:24:44.017 --> 01:24:49.100]  And you agree right now, right now, General, would you say right now we are starting to win?
[01:24:51.636 --> 01:24:52.316]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:54.937]  Absolutely.
[01:24:54.997 --> 01:24:57.997]  It's like a fourth and one going into the end zone.
[01:24:58.277 --> 01:24:59.658]  We're going to get into the end zone.
[01:24:59.738 --> 01:25:03.138]  And we're pushing because we're bigger, we're stronger, we're smarter.
[01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:12.040]  So that's about 90% of the General Flynn interview that is so historic, such deep analysis that we did yesterday.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:16.261]  Remember, this is the guy that convinced the globalists eight, nine years ago.
[01:25:17.256 --> 01:25:19.297]  To turn against China, that China was double-crossing him.
[01:25:19.578 --> 01:25:21.319]  He's been a top advisor to the top people.
[01:25:21.779 --> 01:25:22.860]  He's now advising us.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  He's now warning us.
[01:25:24.441 --> 01:25:25.381]  What a powerful interview.
[01:25:26.182 --> 01:25:28.123]  So, we aired about 90% of it.
[01:25:28.163 --> 01:25:31.445]  The rest of it is up at band.video and footwars.com.
[01:25:31.485 --> 01:25:32.406]  I suggest you watch it.
[01:25:32.446 --> 01:25:33.286]  I suggest you share it.
[01:25:33.927 --> 01:25:41.331]  Separately, we have a lot of great products at footwars.com, but three of them, well, two of them have been sold out for a long time.
[01:25:41.391 --> 01:25:42.092]  One of them is brand new.
[01:25:43.112 --> 01:25:45.392]  Turmeric toothpaste with a bunch of essential oils.
[01:25:45.853 --> 01:25:46.993]  So incredible for your teeth.
[01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:48.413]  So incredible for your gums.
[01:25:48.833 --> 01:25:49.813]  Amazing what it does.
[01:25:50.974 --> 01:25:53.074]  Tax inflammation, gingivitis, all that.
[01:25:53.434 --> 01:25:54.294]  You need the toothpaste.
[01:25:54.334 --> 01:25:55.154]  Dr. Jones Naturals.

[01:26:48.216 --> 01:26:50.357]  But whatever you do, make the decision to back the show.

[01:26:56.199 --> 01:27:09.699]  Thank you.

[01:27:12.179 --> 01:27:14.620]  But also a lot of really positive things are happening.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:19.583]  Elon Musk just came out and said the new world order, global government's bad, wants to collapse civilization.
[01:27:19.743 --> 01:27:21.804]  Joe Rogan now sounds just like me.
[01:27:21.984 --> 01:27:24.146]  Everywhere I go we get nothing but positive feedback.
[01:27:24.266 --> 01:27:33.331]  Everybody else I talk to that are prominent leaders in the populist pro-human movement, not just here but around the world, are saying they're getting nothing but 99% positive feedback.
[01:27:33.431 --> 01:27:36.873]  So, humanity really is accelerating their awakening.
[01:27:37.473 --> 01:27:41.055]  That said, you see the coup at Project Veritas taking out James O'Keefe.
[01:27:41.195 --> 01:27:45.876]  You see all the other political attacks going on against Patriots, not just here, but other parts of the world.
[01:27:45.977 --> 01:27:47.557]  The enemy is coming down on us.
[01:27:47.777 --> 01:27:50.438]  And we're not funded by George Soros or billionaires.
[01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:53.239]  We're funded directly by viewers and listeners like you.
[01:27:53.379 --> 01:27:56.821]  And the work we do is so incredibly important and changes the world.
[01:27:56.921 --> 01:28:02.723]  So it's not an exaggeration to say, without Infowars, humanity would be in much worse shape than we are right now.
[01:28:02.803 --> 01:28:07.125]  But due to your past support, due to your prayers, due to your word of mouth, humanity really has a fighting chance.
[01:28:06.925 --> 01:28:09.645]   chance. So I wanted to tell you about some of the great products here that

[01:28:34.098 --> 01:28:35.358]  It's back in stock, discounted.
[01:28:35.458 --> 01:28:36.719]  Infomorestore.com.
[01:28:36.779 --> 01:28:38.399]  We've got, of course, the Ultimate Fish Oil.
[01:28:38.499 --> 01:28:39.900]  We've got the Ultimate Krill Oil.

[01:28:48.883 --> 01:28:50.124]  Fizzy Magnesium.
[01:28:50.204 --> 01:28:51.084]  The list goes on and on.
[01:28:51.624 --> 01:28:58.828]  I told you about a month ago, we've only had 1,500 books left to sign, and I'm not signing any more Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:28:58.928 --> 01:28:59.709]  It's a fundraiser.
[01:28:59.749 --> 01:29:03.731]  You can buy the book unsigned or buy the signed book to know you helped keep us on the air.
[01:29:03.931 --> 01:29:05.892]  When these 1,500 books are gone, they're gone.
[01:29:05.912 --> 01:29:10.035]  Now, most of the books were at our new warehouse in Denver, the unsigned ones.
[01:29:10.075 --> 01:29:11.035]  We didn't have the books here.
[01:29:11.075 --> 01:29:11.315]  We had like 200.
[01:29:12.895 --> 01:29:14.316]  We finally got them shipped down here.
[01:29:14.996 --> 01:29:22.279]  I got them all signed last weekend, and we are ready to ship them to you as soon as we ship it back next week to the Denver Shipping Department.
[01:29:22.379 --> 01:29:26.601]  So, it's a pre-order, but they'll be shipping out in about a week, and when these books are gone, they're gone.
[01:29:26.721 --> 01:29:34.524]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy by Alex Jones, exclusively at InfoWarStore.com, and that again will keep us on air.
[01:29:34.684 --> 01:29:36.966]  Those of you that did buy the signed book, I want to thank you.
[01:29:37.026 --> 01:29:38.187]  You're the reason we're still on air.
[01:29:38.307 --> 01:29:41.750]  But those that haven't gotten a signed book, this is your last chance and I hope you'll get a copy.
[01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:44.433]  I know the crew wants to stay employed in the fight against the globalists.
[01:29:44.513 --> 01:29:45.333]  They hope you get a copy.
[01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:50.578]  But regardless, this will nourish your mind and give you evidence to weigh up your friends and family and others against the new world order.

[01:29:57.603 --> 01:30:01.305]  Two of the items that are amazing are BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra.
[01:30:01.365 --> 01:30:03.546]  They're both different nootrobics, do different things.
[01:30:03.667 --> 01:30:05.187]  They're clean, healthy brain boost.
[01:30:05.307 --> 01:30:08.569]  They're both 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com right now as well.
