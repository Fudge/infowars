[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  [Outro]
[00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:23.599]  I knew when humanity found out about the plan to kill us all that we'd start rallying.
[00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.939]  And it's begun.
[00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.302]  It's Sunday, December 10th, 2023, and we are all men and women in the arena.
[00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:32.942]  Get ready.
[00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:34.163]  InfoWars.
[00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:36.103]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:46.307]  I will run around, and I'll jump off the ground and shine!
[00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:53.126]  I will show my feet and I will clap my hands and shout.
[00:00:53.126 --> 00:01:02.126]  I will run around, I'll jump off the ground and shout.
[00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:06.126]  I'm gonna let 'em shine.
[00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:10.126]  Jesus is the light and I'm gonna let 'em shine.
[00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:14.126]  Jesus is the light and I'm gonna let 'em shine.
[00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:18.925]  Two hour plus interview with Elon Musk.
[00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:18.474]  Spaniard.
[00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:20.616]  Spaniard.
[00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:23.277]  I interviewed Elon Musk for two hours today.
[00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:25.459]  So entertained!
[00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:27.040]  A lot's happening right now.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.521]  We are all men and women in the arena.
[00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:30.362]  And we're about to win.
[00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:33.584]  The globalists are in desperate straits right now.
[00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.185]  Are you not entertained?
[00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:41.365]   is the question on this live Sunday December 10th, 2023 transmission.
[00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:51.365]  [MUSIC]
[00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:15.365]  You can't ever win a fight if you don't know you're in one.
[00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.482]  But once you know you're in one, you realize who you are.
[00:02:19.243 --> 00:02:21.063]  Winning fights becomes quite easy.
[00:02:22.024 --> 00:02:25.265]  So awaken to the information war.
[00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:28.026]  Are you not entertained?
[00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:33.146]  Are you not entertained?
[00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:35.146]  Are you not entertained?
[00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:41.945]  Is this not why you are here?
[00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:48.945]  [crowd chanting]
[00:03:09.664 --> 00:03:12.945]  There is a civil war inside the republic.
[00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:16.098]  The decision, the future is being decided now.
[00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.221]  An InfoWars is being put back in the arena.
[00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:22.383]  Back in the game.
[00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:25.906]  It's the nature of the universe.
[00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:27.527]  Struggle.
[00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:29.349]  And conflict.
[00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.591]  Alright, you see that headline, and it's a true headline.
[00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:36.174]  Alex Jones interviews Elon Musk for 2 plus hours live.
[00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.836]  It just ended like 45 minutes ago.
[00:03:38.856 --> 00:03:41.719]  As soon as we get the file, I'm told we have it.
[00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:47.891]   We're going to be playing large excerpts of it, but regardless, it was big.
[00:03:47.891 --> 00:04:07.891]   So, you would imagine the rest of the broadcast would be about that and the incredible things covered.
[00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:11.097]  And it will be, over the next few days.
[00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:20.918]  But instead, in the first part of the broadcast, we're talking about what's really important.
[00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:31.525]  We have the Secretary of Defense and now the head of the State Department, Blinken, come out and say, yeah, we're going to full war with Russia unless you give us unlimited money for Russia.
[00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:34.327]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:04:36.728 --> 00:04:37.689]  And it's all coming up.
[00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:39.931]  The last resort of tyrants is war.
[00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:44.965]  And the health of a corrupt, parasitic, cancerous state is war.
[00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:49.569]  It's all getting covered tonight, Sunday, December 10th, 2023.
[00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:54.173]  Infowars.com and Band.Video are the coordinates of LibertÃ©.
[00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:59.278]  There aren't many people in the world that are affecting the battle plan for the future of humanity.
[00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.342]  There's less than a few dozen on the enemy side, less than ten on our side.
[00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:08.187]  And I say this not as a matter of bragging, but as a matter of fact.
[00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:22.259]  This transmission, our guests, myself, this transmission, this broadcast is seen on the side of liberty as one of the main fountains or the progenitors or the source of the pro-human resistance against the globalists.
[00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.863]  A pro-human future.
[00:05:28.493 --> 00:05:29.433]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:37.775]  330 days, 7 hours, 3 minutes, 24 seconds from the most important election in world history.
[00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:42.256]  Thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:51.299]  Alright, if you see the live show headline, you're like, wow, Alex Jones is about to interview Elon Musk for two plus hours live!
[00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.020]  And I guarantee you I am, because it already happened.
[00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.262]  About 45 minutes before this live show began at 4 p.m.
[00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:16.115]  Central Standard Time, I interviewed Elon Musk for over two hours on a live feed of Spaces on X, formerly Twitter, and I got some great questions in.
[00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:18.777]  Vivek Ramaswamy was there.
[00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:27.432]   Here's the Headline, Alex Jones joins Elon Musk, Andrew Tate, Vivek Ranaswani in a wild X-Spaces conversation.
[00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:29.454]  Congressman Matt Gaetz was there.
[00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:31.335]  General Michael Flynn was there.
[00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:33.877]  Mark Tice was there.
[00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.138]  He's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.540]  It was incredible.
[00:06:37.588 --> 00:06:52.980]  But we'll get to that when Mark Dice joins us, because I'd love to talk about that and how positive it was and how he came out against the New World Order and talked about their plan to depopulate humanity and all the rest of it and what that signifies with millions watching and tens of millions more to watch later.
[00:06:54.061 --> 00:07:04.669]  But up front and in our grill is Biden a week ago, Secretary of Defense five, six days ago, Lloyd Austin, and now.
[00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:38.221]   The Secretary of State Blinken, we have the clip, we'll play it in a moment, saying that if we don't give a hundred plus billion dollars, no questions asked, on top of the hundreds of billions of dollars, to the cokehead, gay prostitute, Zelensky, who plays the piano with his penis on TV, in between wearing black leather fetish outfits, dresses a woman with high heels, slapping men's butts, Point is it's fully compromised.
[00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:43.030]  If we don't give him that money, we're going to be at war with U.S.
[00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.376]  troops dying on the ground, which is already happening.
[00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:49.703]  In fact, here's the clip.
[00:07:52.554 --> 00:07:56.155]  Trump is scrambling to reach a deal to pass foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel.
[00:07:56.195 --> 00:08:02.837]  Republicans are insisting on more border funding and new asylum restrictions that that be added to the bill.
[00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:08.138]  What would it mean for Ukraine and Israel if Congress does not pass any additional support by the end of the year?
[00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:13.520]  And why not agree to tougher border protections, which is an issue of national security as well?
[00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:21.152]  Well, Jake, the border piece, as you know, is out of my purview, but I can say this.
[00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:29.866]  I know on day one of this administration, or at least day two, the President put before Congress, I think, the first bill on immigration reform.
[00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:31.368]  Unfortunately, Congress hasn't acted on that.
[00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:42.254]  In this request for additional funds, there is $6 billion to enhance border security, including having more people on the border.
[00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:47.217]  So I know that's very much part of the discussion and something the President is prepared to engage on.
[00:08:47.657 --> 00:09:00.403]   But in terms of what it would mean for Ukraine, what it would mean for Israel, what it would mean for our efforts to be competitive in the Indo-Pacific, I think the only people who'd be happy if this supplemental budget request is not Really?
[00:09:00.423 --> 00:09:00.984]  No, that's true.
[00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:06.203]   by Congress are sitting in Moscow, sitting in Tehran, sitting in Beijing.
[00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:08.163]  For Ukraine, this is absolutely vital.
[00:09:08.163 --> 00:09:11.562]  They've made remarkable progress over the last year in --
[00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:12.562]  Really?
[00:09:12.562 --> 00:09:13.562]  No, that's true.
[00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:15.963]   -- taking back more than 50 percent of the territory that was seized --
[00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:16.963]  Not true.
[00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:18.443]  -- since February of 2022.
[00:09:18.443 --> 00:09:21.703]   But they're in a ferocious battle now in the south and the east.
[00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:24.083]  We are running out of funding for them.
[00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:27.403]   By the way, 90 percent of the assistance, the security assistance that we've provided
[00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:31.884]   Ukraine is actually invested right here in the United States to our companies, to our
[00:09:31.884 --> 00:09:32.882]  manufacturers.
[00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:37.005]  Similarly, we've had extraordinary burden sharing with our allies and partners.
[00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:41.467]  We've provided very significant assistance, about $70 billion over the last two years.
[00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:47.130]  Our European friends and partners beyond Europe, more than $110 billion for Ukraine.
[00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:49.312]  So we have the burden sharing that we need.
[00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:54.656]  This is a time to really step up, because if we don't, we know what happens.
[00:09:55.297 --> 00:10:00.361]  Putin will be able to move forward with impunity, and we know he won't stop in Ukraine.
[00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.143]  And he may well end up going after a NATO country.
[00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:06.046]  That would bring us in, given our obligations to our NATO allies.
[00:10:06.566 --> 00:10:10.530]  So here, an ounce of prevention is really worth 10 pounds of cure.
[00:10:11.497 --> 00:10:13.797]  Oh, a little Benjamin Franklin quote taken out of context.
[00:10:13.857 --> 00:10:35.682]  So, the West overthrows the Ukrainian government nine years ago, starts the war, kicks the Russians' asses all the way to their border, kicking their own people out, they respond back, and now Zelensky has been, his people have been slaughtered, and now their answer is, oh, it's going quite well, they've done a really good job, let's send more money there when they're now the average age of their conscripts, like, 57 years old?
[00:10:36.642 --> 00:10:37.422]  No, they've lost.
[00:10:39.537 --> 00:10:42.439]  And if Russia was on our border, I would be fully against Russia.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.242]  What an insane time to be alive.
[00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:46.603]  Look at some of these headlines.
[00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:48.104]  Top defense official, U.S.
[00:10:48.144 --> 00:10:51.827]  can handle Middle East, Russia, China operations all at once.
[00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:54.289]  U.S.
[00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:57.732]  vetoes Gaza ceasefire, province from arms sales, same day.
[00:10:59.073 --> 00:11:06.537]   Secretary of State Blinken claims Russia will invade NATO countries because Congress Is refusing to pass the 100 million plus aid bill.
[00:11:07.239 --> 00:11:10.645]  Putin strengthens relations with Middle Eastern powers as Biden flounders.
[00:11:11.647 --> 00:11:13.550]  Musk calls out Biden over U.S.
[00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.714]  journalists jailed for four or five months.
[00:11:17.523 --> 00:11:18.223]  And it goes on.
[00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.464]  Numbers of attacks at U.S.
[00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.686]  bases in Iraq and Syria pushes past 80.
[00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:31.232]  And now the Pentagon says, look at this headline, that they can fight more than three wars at once.
[00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:33.313]  Top defense official, U.S.
[00:11:33.453 --> 00:11:38.997]  can handle Middle East, Russia, China operations all at once.
[00:11:40.987 --> 00:11:42.948]  Couldn't handle Vietnam because they wouldn't give up.
[00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:44.730]  Couldn't handle Korea because they wouldn't give up.
[00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.011]  I'm not saying the North Koreans were good, they were terrible.
[00:11:47.652 --> 00:11:50.133]  But we can handle China with a million and a half people.
[00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:52.435]  We can handle Russia with the biggest nuclear arsenal.
[00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:56.417]  We can handle the whole Middle East with our collapsing border.
[00:11:56.698 --> 00:12:03.002]  But we can't handle the fentanyl deaths and the suicide and the inflation and the needles and poop everywhere.
[00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:04.023]  No.
[00:12:04.423 --> 00:12:07.485]  America is being positioned into destruction.
[00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:24.226]  And under Trump for four years, no wars, major peace deals, Abraham Accords, North Korean deal, Russians deals, Russia didn't go into Ukraine because Trump said, we're not going to push missiles up to your border, but if you go in, we'll attack you.
[00:12:24.606 --> 00:12:28.430]  And instead, we've seen the absolute opposite since then.
[00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.335]  Total escalation into massive war.
[00:12:34.997 --> 00:12:45.120]  Meanwhile, domestically, they are pushing racial division and the UN is pushing racial division like never before in this country.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.100]  And I want to explain something.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.601]  I know most of you know this, but we have a lot of new listeners today.
[00:12:48.621 --> 00:12:52.742]  I've been number one for three days on Twitter and so many other platforms.
[00:12:53.162 --> 00:12:57.884]  Tens of millions of new people hitting Infowars.com and Band.video and sharing those links.
[00:12:58.804 --> 00:13:18.784]   Barbados demands $4.9 trillion In reparations for former slave-owning countries around the world, nothing about African countries, four of them still with slavery going on, nothing about Africans kidnapping more than 250 million Europeans over a thousand years out of Europe, which is ridiculous.
[00:13:18.804 --> 00:13:22.608]  You can't blame Africans for what their random ancestors did 500, 1,000 years ago.
[00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:35.778]  But the next big thing other than climate change, oh pay big banks money because you're hurting the earth, put fart bags on cows, shut down all the coal plants, is reparations!
[00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:44.964]  Oh, but you pay it to the UN and then they'll pay some black people some money but they got to get on a globalist bank and be sterilized for the money.
[00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:51.309]  It's the plan with the universal basic income, the universal social credit score.
[00:13:52.269 --> 00:14:08.119]   Barbados Prime Minister Mia Motley has urged the UK to pay 4.9 trillion, that's way more than their GDP, in reparations for the transatlantic slave trade, which England ended, by the way, worldwide, in London's speech Wednesday.
[00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:17.003]  She added that talks over how this debt should be repaid will be difficult and will take time, but don't worry, they'll be paid through the UN, it'll take 90% of the money.
[00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:20.945]  I mean, does anybody believe you're actually about to get all these free goodies?
[00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:24.754]  Mark Dice has been at the center of this fight for a long time.
[00:14:25.254 --> 00:14:31.999]  He's come out about 15 minutes on this live Sunday show, and then coming up, two-hour live interview with Elon Musk.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.723]  It already happened as soon as he goes live, and we posted the Vandal video, and we'll play it here.
[00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:41.226]  And then Chase Geyser's coming up as well, but you're listening tonight to what they don't want you to hear.
[00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:42.086]  Please spread the word.
[00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:42.547]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:43.672 --> 00:14:51.060]  Less than a day after being reinstated to X, I was on Mario Nafal's number one X Spaces program.
[00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:56.927]  It had over 120,000 people watching at one time, more than 8 million watched it by the time it was over.
[00:14:57.447 --> 00:15:01.972]  Elon Musk came on for more than two hours, and I asked a lot of good questions.
[00:15:02.432 --> 00:15:05.992]   So officially I was the guy getting interviewed, but I turned it around, made it about Elon
[00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:08.753]   Musk because quite frankly he's even more interesting than I am.
[00:15:08.753 --> 00:15:13.312]   We're going to be posting this interview with just my questions, cut down the full interviews,
[00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:15.111]  obviously on Mario's channel.
[00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:16.871]  We'll be posting it to X here in the next few hours.
[00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:23.432]   We'll be playing it on my radio show and TV show tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central, Infowars.com/show.
[00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:28.192]   So for all the people that heard about Infowars but didn't know what we really stood for because
[00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:29.072]  it was misrepresented.
[00:15:29.493 --> 00:15:42.498]  This is your chance to go to mfowards.com forward slash show, band.video, or at realalexjones back on Twitter and actually see what I say, see what I stand for, and see it in context.
[00:15:43.178 --> 00:15:44.118]  At Real Alex Jones.
[00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:45.039]  Please follow us there.
[00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:54.443]  You can also find us where we've still been on air five years after we were deplatformed at InfoWars.com, Ford slash show, Bandai Video, and NewsWars.com.
[00:15:54.463 --> 00:15:55.223]  But this is historic.
[00:15:55.263 --> 00:15:56.344]  It's way bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:15:56.824 --> 00:15:57.904]  This is about Renaissance 2.0.
[00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:00.105]  It's about free speech winning.
[00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:01.586]  It's about the deep state failing.
[00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:03.787]  This is beyond cool.
[00:16:04.347 --> 00:16:12.251]   And again, Elon Musk talks about everything, including subjects he's never I've been asked about before in this interview.
[00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:14.292]  So I'll be on my regular show.
[00:16:14.653 --> 00:16:17.435]  I'll be breaking it down weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:16:17.495 --> 00:16:17.875]  Central.
[00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:26.781]  But you want to hear the Alex Jones-Elon Musk interview at Band.VideoInfoWars.com and at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:28.242]  I want to salute the crew.
[00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:30.023]  I want to salute our supporters.
[00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.105]  I want to salute the folks that have kept us on air.
[00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:33.766]  Tucker Carlson for interviewing me last week.
[00:16:34.206 --> 00:16:36.367]  They took us over the top and I want to salute Elon Musk.
[00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.789]  Freedom of speech is paramount to a free human society.
[00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.930]  We're pro-human.
[00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.090]  We're on Team Human, as Elon Musk said.
[00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:44.611]  The t-shirt's coming soon.
[00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:45.592]  Team Human.
[00:16:45.932 --> 00:16:47.092]  InfoWars.com.
[00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:49.713]  I'll see you on the front lines of the fight for our future.
[00:16:51.034 --> 00:16:53.775]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:55.996 --> 00:16:58.117]  Well, wild stuff is going on.
[00:16:58.157 --> 00:17:01.338]  You can follow us at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:02.979]  You say, why does this matter?
[00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:11.581]  They're gonna be able to steal the election if we don't have information and the truth out there, and they are pulling their hair out everywhere.
[00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:13.401]  When they gave us the account back at like 5 a.m.
[00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:14.442]  this morning, I was already up.
[00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:16.842]  They had like 40,000 people on it.
[00:17:16.942 --> 00:17:21.524]  Now it's 1.3 million or whatever at Real Alex Jones, and it's gonna be exciting.
[00:17:21.544 --> 00:17:25.725]  I'm gonna shoot videos starting tomorrow, just like Tucker Carlson did when he got fired off Fox.
[00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:27.145]  I guess they'll get tens of millions of views.
[00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:30.546]  The few videos we already posted today have gotten millions of views.
[00:17:31.346 --> 00:17:32.547]  It's been incredible.
[00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.029]  And so the fight is definitely on.
[00:17:35.069 --> 00:17:38.752]  Humanity is not just rolling over and crawling into its grave.
[00:17:38.812 --> 00:17:45.617]  Now, somebody that stood up for free speech and is a great media analyst, Mark Dice, is set to join us coming up.
[00:17:45.717 --> 00:17:55.825]  And tomorrow we're going to have Jack Posobiec, so many others that have been fighting as well and exposing the fact that Biden would try to start a full war with Russia.
[00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.947]  He's been saying that for six months, so have I.
[00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:01.167]  As a pretext to try to shut down the election.
[00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:05.351]  So, you know, as fun as it is to say, Oh, I interviewed Elon Musk for two hours a day.
[00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:08.133]  And because I was supposed to be on there being interviewed by him.
[00:18:08.173 --> 00:18:09.374]  And I said, let's turn this around.
[00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:12.337]  Alex Jones is not that interesting compared to Elon Musk.
[00:18:12.397 --> 00:18:17.322]  I said, let's talk about dehumanization, global government, the new world order, the globalist.
[00:18:19.287 --> 00:18:21.549]  The depopulation plan, the chemicals in the water.
[00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:24.251]  I mean, it was spectacular.
[00:18:24.932 --> 00:18:28.475]  And believe me, the corporate media is hoping you don't go dig through it.
[00:18:28.515 --> 00:18:36.722]  But the way Space... Spaces works on Twitter is it goes out live and all these people can be on there.
[00:18:36.742 --> 00:18:37.683]  It really works well now.
[00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:39.204]  It didn't work well until Musk took it over.
[00:18:39.924 --> 00:18:44.008]  And then it kind of just goes out a million or so, watch it, then people really don't take cuts out of it.
[00:18:44.028 --> 00:18:44.989]  It's very hard to download.
[00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.171]  Oh, we've almost downloaded it right now.
[00:18:48.129 --> 00:18:51.191]  And so when Chase Geyser takes over at 6 p.m.
[00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:54.752]  Central in an hour and 35 minutes, he'll have clips on that show.
[00:18:55.192 --> 00:18:57.053]  And then tomorrow on my weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:18:57.093 --> 00:19:04.337]  Central, we'll be playing clips and analyzing this because I think I give myself credit for this.
[00:19:05.998 --> 00:19:08.199]  Ask some of the best questions that Elon Musk has ever been asked.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.320]  You can say what you want about Elon Musk.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.882]  He's a very important player in all this, so we should be looking at it.
[00:19:14.282 --> 00:19:16.623]  He's definitely taking on the current globalist incarnation.
[00:19:18.311 --> 00:19:21.777]  Alright, what are we fighting against, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:19:21.817 --> 00:19:22.899]  What are we up against?
[00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:24.702]  Why is this so important?
[00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:27.546]  Well, they want an internet ID worldwide.
[00:19:28.446 --> 00:19:29.427]  China's already got it.
[00:19:30.187 --> 00:19:31.508]  Bill Gates and the UN are pushing it.
[00:19:31.908 --> 00:19:36.331]  And they know we have morals, so they go, oh, stop pedophilia, something they're running.
[00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:48.137]  Let's have it where when you look at any major porn site, you've got to enter your ID, your name, your information, and a digital time stamp photo of yourself.
[00:19:49.878 --> 00:19:50.158]  Wow!
[00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:53.655]  Thought the liberals were all for open, free society.
[00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:57.018]  Brits may be forced to take selfie before watching porn.
[00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:00.461]  The government's introduced legislation called Privacy Friendly.
[00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:07.187]  And it says that you will have to take a photo of yourself in a database before you watch porn.
[00:20:07.547 --> 00:20:08.908]  That's all about an internet ID.
[00:20:08.928 --> 00:20:17.556]  That's what Nikki Haley's saying where, oh, anybody that's on the internet has to have an ID to stop porn and hate speech, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:18.891 --> 00:20:34.276]   Continuing, beyond shocking, ACLU will represent NRA in free speech Supreme Court case because the Soros combine gave hundreds of millions of dollars the last decade to groups like The American Civil Liberties Union.
[00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:36.637]  They've done nothing to defend against tyranny.
[00:20:36.657 --> 00:20:37.417]  Now they're a joke.
[00:20:37.457 --> 00:20:38.137]  They're obsolete.
[00:20:38.918 --> 00:20:48.542]  So suddenly they're saying, well, these cases where people lose their bank accounts because they're a pro-gun YouTube channel or they're a survival shop, a gun shop, a sporting goods shop.
[00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:53.524]  That's wrong that you're going to ban them selling something legal for their free speech.
[00:20:53.584 --> 00:20:56.785]  So good job to the ACLU.
[00:20:56.845 --> 00:21:02.468]  You're a hundred years late and a trillion dollars short.
[00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:04.748]  There's that report.
[00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:06.529]  Hate hoax foiled.
[00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:07.470]  We see these every day.
[00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.233]   Black woman arrested attempting to set fire to MLK Jr.' 's birth home and blaming on white people.
[00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:17.055]  We should give her the Jussie Smollett Award.
[00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:21.078]  Leftists are glad that white American population is declining.
[00:21:21.098 --> 00:21:21.978]  We have a bunch of clips of it.
[00:21:22.038 --> 00:21:25.260]  But get mad when Vivit Ramaswamy points that out.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:32.638]  That ties into Barbados, I mentioned earlier, demands 4.9 trillion reparations from former slave-owning countries.
[00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:38.104]  It's all incredible divide-and-conquer strategies.
[00:21:39.186 --> 00:21:42.789]  We've got hundreds of news articles pulling their hair out.
[00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.594]  Tucker praises Alex Jones for years of accurate predictions.
[00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:53.307]  Israel needs two more months to win war, destroy Hamas despite ultimatum by U.S.
[00:21:53.787 --> 00:21:56.088]  and mounting pressure to cease fire.
[00:21:56.568 --> 00:21:57.948]  I want to know why Israel stood down.
[00:21:57.968 --> 00:21:59.408]  I don't support Hamas, can't stand them.
[00:22:00.468 --> 00:22:02.129]  I want to ask, what's the bigger picture here?
[00:22:02.189 --> 00:22:03.289]  Why was there a stand down?
[00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:07.930]  Why did O'Biden give six billion dollars to Iran a month before?
[00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.230]  That will all confirm there was an Israeli stand down.
[00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:17.532]   The larger issue is who is playing The different sides off against each other.
[00:22:18.073 --> 00:22:21.416]  That's the big question we've got to be asking and answering here.
[00:22:21.996 --> 00:22:27.741]  Mark Dice joins us in a moment to talk about 2024 election, the censorship, the control, the wars.
[00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:30.023]  The Elon Musk interview, he was part of it.
[00:22:30.864 --> 00:22:31.745]  What's going to happen?
[00:22:31.845 --> 00:22:32.405]  Epic interview.
[00:22:32.445 --> 00:22:35.368]  Vivek Ramaswamy, Mark Dice, General Flynn.
[00:22:37.367 --> 00:22:39.469]  Elon Musk.
[00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.691]  The interview was with me.
[00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:41.511]  It was my show.
[00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:45.535]  I was on as a guest, but I was the moderator.
[00:22:46.056 --> 00:22:46.837]  It was crazy.
[00:22:48.198 --> 00:22:49.499]  Absolutely wild.
[00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:51.542]  Jack Posobiec was there.
[00:22:52.651 --> 00:22:53.771]  It was amazing.
[00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:55.672]  But please remember, we're listener supported.
[00:22:55.712 --> 00:23:00.534]  Get a copy of my new book, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalist, launched next week at Renaissance.

[00:23:22.737 --> 00:23:29.057]   TurboForce, back in stock. All right. Well, Vibhik Ramaswamy, myself, Congressman Matt Gates,
[00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:36.336]   Andrew Tate, Mark Dice, we were all there for a two-plus hour. I was supposed to be interviewed,
[00:23:36.336 --> 00:23:43.537]   but once I got on the Big Spaces show on X, I said very early on, I said,
[00:23:43.537 --> 00:23:46.176]   "I really don't want to make this about an interview about Alex Jones."
[00:23:46.381 --> 00:23:47.723]  We've got Elon Musk here.
[00:23:47.783 --> 00:23:53.108]  So I basically interviewed him and had people ask questions to Elon for over, he was there over two hours.
[00:23:53.889 --> 00:23:55.350]  It just ended about an hour ago.
[00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.732]  We're going to be posting the full thing to InfoWars.com.
[00:23:58.153 --> 00:23:59.134]  We're downloading it right now.
[00:23:59.194 --> 00:24:00.815]  The format they have is very hard to download.
[00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:02.717]  I'll be playing obviously clips tomorrow.
[00:24:03.697 --> 00:24:13.205]  But I wanted to get Mark Dice, Jack Posobiec, Steve Bannon, and a bunch of other people on the show the next few days.
[00:24:13.546 --> 00:24:14.587]  Because right now we're in the limelight.
[00:24:14.607 --> 00:24:15.828]  Everything we do gets millions of views.
[00:24:17.011 --> 00:24:18.012]  Not just the regular show.
[00:24:18.913 --> 00:24:23.678]  To talk about the fight for liberty and the fight for election integrity and the fight against big tech.
[00:24:24.058 --> 00:24:25.580]  Because we don't have free speech, we have nothing.
[00:24:26.261 --> 00:24:30.865]  So somebody that when I first got banned, everybody else ran, almost everybody didn't defend me.
[00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:35.030]  Even some of our crew members that aren't here now didn't even want to be here, didn't want to talk about the show.
[00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.611]  And they gave him the censorship, but Mark Dice didn't.
[00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:45.035]  So I wanted to get media critic, and analyst, and best-selling author, and his new book is the best-seller, War on Conservatives.
[00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:49.458]  It's gone as high as number four on the world charts.
[00:24:49.618 --> 00:24:55.702]  I wanted to get Mark Dice on tonight, before I even knew he would be involved on the Elon Musk interview.
[00:24:56.202 --> 00:24:59.464]  But he was invited there as well, and was there, and got some questions on Elon Musk.
[00:24:59.905 --> 00:25:03.327]  I wanted to invite him on to talk about this epic moment we're in, and get his take on it.
[00:25:03.647 --> 00:25:04.828]  So Mark, great to have you here, my friend.
[00:25:06.394 --> 00:25:17.300]  The media was already close to meltdown just from having you return to X, but the fact that you shared a Twitter space or an X space with Elon for several hours, I can't wait to see the epic meltdown.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.900]  They're going to drown in their own tears.
[00:25:19.061 --> 00:25:30.807]  And part of the reason, large part of the reason, really the reason why you were restored is because Elon Musk had a misconception about you and about why you were actually banned.
[00:25:30.827 --> 00:25:33.674]   And that's why I followed your career very closely.
[00:25:33.974 --> 00:25:42.979]  For those who don't know, Alex is largely responsible for launching my career, and I've been a regular guest on his show for 18 years, since 2005, and Alex has helped me.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.060]  I've never worked for him.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.421]  God knows he's tried.
[00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:46.622]  I've always remained independent.
[00:25:46.662 --> 00:26:14.379]   I'm just too bullheaded, but he's been a great friend, and he's had me on a regular guest, helped my career, helped me publish one of my books back about 12 years ago, and so I followed Alex is unpersoning very very closely and everybody had the misconception because of the mainstream media's lies they tried to construct a false identity by exploiting and amplifying Alex's flaws and Alex is a genius as people know and with most geniuses their genius is counterbalanced by
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.001]  Often an equal-sized flaw.
[00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:27.825]  Steve Jobs, genius, when he knocked up his girlfriend and got a pregnancy, got the DNA test, there was a 2% chance that he was not the father, a 98% chance he's the father.
[00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:37.609]  And so in his mind, he extrapolated 2% of the male population in Cupertino and then argued that there could be 10,000 different women that are the father of this child.
[00:26:37.649 --> 00:26:47.209]   So, you know, Alex, despite his flaws, Those were not why he was banned, and so I was just hammering from day one for years the reason Alex was suspended.
[00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:57.294]  That was cited and Elon confirmed in the Twitter space, the X space today, is for confronting Oliver Darcy, little Brian Stelter's sidekick, on public property.
[00:26:57.674 --> 00:26:58.675]  He's a public figure.
[00:26:58.955 --> 00:27:01.456]  He was working in the capacity of a reporter at the time.
[00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:08.680]  It's not like Alex found him out to dinner with his family or the grocery store and pulled out a phone and started live streaming on Periscope and harassed him.
[00:27:09.247 --> 00:27:18.183]  Literally confronting one of the lead censors, one of the guys who behind the scenes and then was later admitting that he was censoring Alex and got Alex banned from the platform.
[00:27:18.223 --> 00:27:19.725]  So this is fantastic.
[00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:21.469]  It's a great moment for free speech.
[00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:28.168]  The fact that Elon joined the space, had a discussion, Elon now knows why you were banned.
[00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:37.056]  The majority even of Alex's fans probably falsely believe it had to do with his comments about a tragedy almost a decade ago.
[00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:53.183]   But my main point, which is why I wanted to reiterate this with Elon, I'm glad that he brought this up, is Alex was suspended, censored, because he confronted a supposed journalist in Washington, D.C., outside of a congressional hearing, about social media censorship.
[00:27:53.343 --> 00:27:57.607]  And Mark, you've hammered that, and Elon responded to you days ago, and you're part of the reason I got in the band.
[00:27:57.647 --> 00:27:58.307]  I appreciate that.
[00:27:58.327 --> 00:28:01.730]  But moving on to the war on conservatives, their plan to steal the next election.
[00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.654]  How surreal was it that you and I are there for hours interviewing Elon Musk?
[00:28:06.714 --> 00:28:07.635]  I mean, that was crazy.
[00:28:09.258 --> 00:28:20.314]  It's a great Christmas gift and I mean sometimes things unexpected happen and just when all hope seems lost there's a strange turn of events and it turns out often better times than you could have even imagined.
[00:28:20.594 --> 00:28:31.845]   I was thrilled just the fact you were allowed back on the platform and then all of a sudden this morning I wake up and I see Elon He's responding to me, confirming that my analysis of why you were banned is, quote, accurate, he said.
[00:28:32.345 --> 00:28:33.966]  And then we're talking with him in a space.
[00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:36.227]  Elon now gets to know the full story.
[00:28:36.527 --> 00:28:38.028]  Tucker Carlson standing up for you.
[00:28:38.308 --> 00:28:43.951]  And I think, by the way, that interview was so fantastic because for people who are familiar with you, it was still a great interview.
[00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:53.196]  But because it was Tucker and he can introduce Alex to a larger audience, maybe who aren't listeners to the show, only see the memes, only see little clips.
[00:28:53.776 --> 00:29:04.963]  It was such a fantastic interview, because Alex can get a little excited, a little wound up, but during the first, I'd say, three quarters, he was very calm and on his best behavior, and it was a very good discussion.
[00:29:05.003 --> 00:29:08.865]  And then towards the end, he started to loosen up and started having his monologues.
[00:29:08.885 --> 00:29:26.804]   But you were so respectful of Tucker, and Tucker was so brilliant in asking the correct questions, that that interview, I believe, And people bombarding Elon with the fact about what really happened led to him seeing who the real Alex Jones is, and that's who us, the listeners, have known who Alex is.
[00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:34.731]  And that's a redemption story for America, because the left has demonized America and said, we're a lie, we're a fraud, and taken things out of context.
[00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:35.852]  It's really a microcosm.
[00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:51.275]  You know, the one thing I wanted to ask Elon, I just kind of touched on, I fired a couple points at him and just wanted him to respond, but he was so overwhelmed with questions and it's hard, especially when you spit three different comments at him, but Elon's going to have to make some very difficult decisions here coming up.
[00:29:51.375 --> 00:30:04.135]   I wanted to ask him, what is he going to do, if or likely when, He's pressured by the app stores to ban you, certain individuals, discussions about certain things, or be removed from the app store.
[00:30:04.295 --> 00:30:07.517]  And that might have seemed unprecedented a few years ago.
[00:30:07.557 --> 00:30:10.880]  No, no, Apple threatened that.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.820]  What is he going to do?
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:21.703]   And hopefully, He's preparing, just like Andrew Torbett did with Gab, where you can use Gab on your phone, save to home screen, use it through the browser.
[00:30:21.723 --> 00:30:26.487]  It functions almost exactly like an app, minus the push notifications, which you don't really need.
[00:30:26.507 --> 00:30:29.751]  The only reason you need a push notification is for text messages and emails.
[00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:50.256]  So hopefully Elon is preparing so that if it is pulled from the App Store, that immediately the browser version can still function as a mobile app by saving... No, you're right, because for people that don't really follow this or listen to our talk radio, and I don't blame you, the Deep State's trying to get Elon banned off the App Store.
[00:30:50.296 --> 00:30:52.117]  I mean, that's the 2.0 censorship.
[00:30:55.129 --> 00:31:00.072]  And, you know, I noticed that Marjorie Taylor Greene gave you a shout out yesterday during the poll.
[00:31:00.393 --> 00:31:02.074]  Matt Gaetz joined the Twitter space.
[00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:05.216]  Vivek Ramaswamy joined the space.
[00:31:05.736 --> 00:31:08.578]  But I noticed I didn't see any Fox News hosts.
[00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:12.381]  I didn't see any Daily Wire hosts retweet the poll.
[00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:13.261]  Maybe they did.
[00:31:13.322 --> 00:31:13.902]  I didn't see it.
[00:31:13.922 --> 00:31:16.644]  I didn't see them celebrating Alex being restored.
[00:31:16.664 --> 00:31:19.226]  The very strange sort of silence there.
[00:31:20.316 --> 00:31:23.699]  I think Alex being back on is a tremendous victory for his free speech.
[00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:29.143]  Hopefully we can get Owen restored, the official InfoWars account restored as well.
[00:31:29.163 --> 00:31:43.554]  But I don't think Elon knew, as smart as he is, he's juggling a million different things and a million different companies, and as brilliant as he is, when he got involved with this, I really don't think, no disrespect to him, but I don't think he really understood what he was fully getting involved in.
[00:31:43.594 --> 00:31:50.079]  Because this is not early 2000s social media where it's a neat way to communicate and a neat way to share links.
[00:31:50.359 --> 00:32:01.754]  We're talking about a technology that shapes the culture, that drives the news cycle, that is an information warfare weapon when abused and when manipulated.
[00:32:01.774 --> 00:32:04.939]  That's right, this is the battlefield and he's entered the battlefield.
[00:32:06.075 --> 00:32:18.381]  Yeah, and he's used to science and rockets and cars and engineers, and he might not have known really what he was getting into, and he got a rude awakening, and it's being pushed on him.
[00:32:18.441 --> 00:32:22.262]  I mean, they're circling the wagons, they want to destroy him, just like they did President Trump.
[00:32:22.562 --> 00:32:25.484]  He may be enemy number one now, until next year.
[00:32:25.504 --> 00:32:29.906]  Well, that's right, and when they illogically attack him, he attacks back with logic, and it's like...
[00:32:30.806 --> 00:32:35.027]  They're not even communicating, and whatever they do to him doesn't matter because he doesn't even understand them.
[00:32:35.388 --> 00:32:36.268]  It's all a bunch of crap.
[00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:38.369]  Let's talk about the election coming up in your new book.
[00:32:38.409 --> 00:32:39.429]  Enough about Alex Jones.
[00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:41.530]  Let's talk about Mark Dice, Donald Trump, and more.
[00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:41.950]  Stay with us.
[00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:47.051]  Alright, investigative journalist, bestselling author Mark Dice is our guest here on the Alex Jones Show, and yeah, it's surreal.
[00:32:47.592 --> 00:32:53.894]  Just interviewed, it ended over an hour ago, two hours plus with Elon Musk, and I was directing the interview.
[00:32:54.094 --> 00:32:56.935]  The great folks had me on their show with The Spaces.
[00:32:59.329 --> 00:33:01.632]  It's the Top Spaces deal, Mario, isn't it?
[00:33:02.373 --> 00:33:04.135]  And Natal is the head of it.
[00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.578]  But Mark, let's shift gears to Alex Jones.
[00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:07.459]  Let's talk big picture.
[00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:15.789]  Trump, the indictments, Hunter Biden indictments, the wars, just how would you describe the insane place we're at right now and what are your predictions?
[00:33:17.406 --> 00:33:27.570]  These next three weeks as Christmas and New Year's come, the year kind of winds down, things are going to slow down, news cycle slows down, everyone's going to kind of reflect on the top ten this and what happened throughout the year.
[00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.431]  But then come January, it's going to get intense.
[00:33:30.511 --> 00:33:35.013]  And I've been wargaming in my mind all the possible scenarios for what's going to happen next year.
[00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:36.854]  I don't think most people are prepared.
[00:33:36.874 --> 00:33:38.635]  It's almost like doing your taxes.
[00:33:38.675 --> 00:33:40.876]  Most people put it off until April 14th.
[00:33:40.996 --> 00:33:41.916]  It's just, it's painful.
[00:33:41.997 --> 00:33:42.637]  It's a hassle.
[00:33:42.817 --> 00:33:43.297]  I'll do it later.
[00:33:43.317 --> 00:33:43.737]  I'll do it later.
[00:33:43.757 --> 00:33:44.578]  I don't want to think about it.
[00:33:44.878 --> 00:33:47.379]  Or if you got like a toothache, it's, oh, this will go away.
[00:33:47.419 --> 00:33:49.000]  I'll just, it'll go away.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.781]  I'll deal with it later.
[00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.702]  Until all of a sudden it becomes a big problem.
[00:33:52.362 --> 00:33:56.524]  And we're so used, we all have kind of normalcy bias about everything rolling off of Trump's back.
[00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:59.366]  The Mueller investigation turned out to be an utter joke.
[00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:01.887]  The humiliation of that crazy old man.
[00:34:02.227 --> 00:34:03.628]  Couldn't even answer anybody's questions.
[00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:07.050]  The two impeachments, just a total joke.
[00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:08.010]  This is not a joke.
[00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:10.872]  And I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen.
[00:34:11.232 --> 00:34:15.895]  And there's several possible scenarios and they all lead to utter chaos.
[00:34:15.955 --> 00:34:18.856]  So I have no idea what's going to happen because- No, no, I agree though.
[00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:19.917]  It runs from bad to worse.
[00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.298]  So go through the scenarios.
[00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:26.440]  One of the scenarios, Trump defeats the charges, there's going to be riots.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.461]  There's going to be chaos.
[00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:30.323]  He gets convicted and then they're overturned on appeal.
[00:34:30.583 --> 00:34:32.804]  Going to be riots from the left and total chaos.
[00:34:33.522 --> 00:34:38.264]  If he gets convicted, loses the appeals, rejects the appeals, they'll likely expedite sentencing.
[00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:44.447]  He could literally be sentenced to prison by the convention by June or July.
[00:34:44.627 --> 00:34:46.812]   And if that happens, What are they going to do?
[00:34:46.832 --> 00:34:49.173]  Are they going to sentence him to house arrest?
[00:34:49.233 --> 00:34:53.294]  Are they going to sentence him to prison in a military base for extra security?
[00:34:53.394 --> 00:34:57.695]  And if that is an election meddling, putting the guy 20 points ahead in jail, good God.
[00:34:58.175 --> 00:34:58.835]  But it gets worse.
[00:34:58.915 --> 00:35:03.016]  It gets worse though, because once somebody's in prison, they have their free speech restricted.
[00:35:03.076 --> 00:35:09.698]  So he's not going to be able, the judge will say, you're not allowed to do interviews, not allowed to do phone calls, not allowed to have the internet.
[00:35:09.718 --> 00:35:13.619]  So if they're going to be house arrest, he's going to be on a military base for extra security.
[00:35:14.339 --> 00:35:19.884]  So, I don't care if he is convicted and sitting in a prison cell or house arrest or a military base.
[00:35:20.365 --> 00:35:23.587]  Those three possibilities are very, very realistic.
[00:35:23.908 --> 00:35:25.169]  I will still be voting for him.
[00:35:25.429 --> 00:35:40.142]  And then it gets even weirder because if he wins the election, then are they going to swear him in remotely or are they going to allow him to be sworn in by having visitors come in and make the official swearing in ceremony so that he can pardon himself and let himself out?
[00:35:41.059 --> 00:35:44.260]  All of these scenarios, I don't think anybody has really, like, mapped them out.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.960]  No, you're right.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.340]  We're in Twilight Zone territory.
[00:35:48.461 --> 00:35:50.041]  There's a collapse of an empire, you know.
[00:35:50.561 --> 00:35:59.283]  As a whole, the United States is in huge trouble, and that's why the conclusion of my new book, The War on Conservatives, sort of outlined all the chaos and all the problems, how we got here.
[00:36:00.043 --> 00:36:16.498]   But then at the very end, I do cover some solutions, and that's what you did in your book, The Great Awakening, because Locally, we can preserve our family, our friends, our community, even some states, even some regions within certain states, but it's gonna get so crazy that
[00:36:17.348 --> 00:36:18.608]  Nobody knows what's going to happen.
[00:36:18.768 --> 00:36:19.809]  Trump could have a health issue.
[00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:21.629]  He could get, God forbid, assassinated.
[00:36:21.869 --> 00:36:24.070]  Biden could have a health issue and drop out.
[00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.470]  And the Democrats have painted themselves into a corner.
[00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:36.333]  We talked about this last time I was on because if they replace Biden with Gavin Newsom, they're going to look weak because the succession should be Kamala Harris would replace him and the party would rally behind her.
[00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:37.434]  But she's awful.
[00:36:37.494 --> 00:36:38.774]  Everybody knows she's awful.
[00:36:39.275 --> 00:36:42.316]  She doesn't have much support with the Democrat Party at all.
[00:36:42.656 --> 00:36:50.561]  So they can't just pass the baton to her and then have Joe Biden duck out for health reasons and have her lead the party to supposed victory.
[00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:51.922]  They're going to have to replace her.
[00:36:51.942 --> 00:36:54.563]  Well, to me, it's pretty clear they're trying to get Gavin Newsom running.
[00:36:56.424 --> 00:37:09.456]   Yeah, but it may ultimately end up at the convention because then they can put it off on not the Democrat Party replacing Kamala Harris as the next successor, bypassing her for Gavin Newsom.
[00:37:09.476 --> 00:37:13.897]  They may have the delegates do it at the convention, but they've painted themselves into a corner.
[00:37:14.318 --> 00:37:19.560]  And Joe Biden admitted, finally the obvious, that he wouldn't be running again if it weren't for Donald Trump.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.941]  Because if he ducked out, he would look like a coward and a failure.
[00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:27.103]  And then Donald Trump could use that to show that he was afraid of having a rematch.
[00:37:27.463 --> 00:37:33.845]   And so if Donald Trump didn't run again, Then Joe Biden would have ducked out and said, mission accomplished.
[00:37:34.065 --> 00:37:37.327]  All I wanted to do was stop Donald Trump from becoming president.
[00:37:37.947 --> 00:37:43.749]  So they are in a pickle because whatever they do, they're going to look weak.
[00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:51.231]   Even if they keep him in and try to inject him with more amphetamines as is obvious that they were doing and as Tucker Carlson
[00:37:51.231 --> 00:37:54.421]   revealed he has a personal source that knows they were doing that. That's why
[00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:58.021]   at the convention or at the debates in 2020 Joe Biden seemed somewhat
[00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:01.840]   coherent but he's aging like milk. People with dementia start to slide down that
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.450]   slope very fast and so they're gonna have to protect him like they did John Fetterman.
[00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.700]   But even if he is the nominee they may keep him to the end because the
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.770]   Democrats did vote for you know somebody with the idea.
[00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.531]  No, no, I agree.
[00:38:12.551 --> 00:38:13.051]  I agree.
[00:38:13.092 --> 00:38:21.080]  It's looking more and more like, because they just banned in Florida, even Democrats on the ballot in the primaries, it looks like they're actually going to try to put the Crypt Keeper in there.
[00:38:21.141 --> 00:38:26.286]  But what if the deep state assassinates Biden and blames it on Trump supporters?
[00:38:26.386 --> 00:38:28.489]  I really see that as the wild card.
[00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:36.552]  You know, there's a half a dozen or a dozen different scenarios, and that's one of the unfortunate ones, but it may even be a black swan.
[00:38:36.572 --> 00:38:46.994]  It may be something so unforeseen that none of us have even thought of, but every possible logical path that is visible now leads to a very disturbing scenario.
[00:38:47.034 --> 00:38:53.796]  And we are, like I said, we're in a collapsing empire as a whole, morally, financially, uh, patriotically.
[00:38:53.836 --> 00:38:59.335]   We've never seen so much People in our own country hating our symbols, hating our history.
[00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:06.040]  So it's like Elon Musk said with you and I interviewing him just an hour ago, at the end he said, nobody's going to be bored in the next 11 months.
[00:39:07.515 --> 00:39:08.396]  It's going to be intense.
[00:39:08.476 --> 00:39:09.876]  So enjoy the next three weeks.
[00:39:09.956 --> 00:39:10.977]  Enjoy the rest of the year.
[00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:13.178]  Enjoy Christmas and New Year's with your family and friends.
[00:39:13.439 --> 00:39:15.420]  And then we're going to hit the road running.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.321]  It's going to be completely insane.
[00:39:18.662 --> 00:39:19.262]  Nobody knows.
[00:39:19.582 --> 00:39:22.064]  I'm getting anxiety just thinking about it.
[00:39:22.264 --> 00:39:23.084]  I am too.
[00:39:23.304 --> 00:39:26.046]  I'm looking forward to the end of the year here so I can relax a little bit.
[00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:35.633]  But the more I think about this, the more I realize that it's like tax day is coming and nobody's prepared and there's going to be issues that are going to be dealt with.
[00:39:36.113 --> 00:39:38.515]  And I can't see Trump taking a plea deal and ducking out.
[00:39:39.797 --> 00:39:41.718]  I'm sure that they're going to try to offer that to him.
[00:39:41.798 --> 00:39:46.042]  So it's going to be, it's going to be, it's been, it's been offered to him.
[00:39:46.382 --> 00:39:47.263]  He's not like Nixon.
[00:39:47.303 --> 00:39:48.084]  He's not stepping down.
[00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:49.723]  No.
[00:39:49.783 --> 00:39:50.723]  He's never going to do it.
[00:39:50.904 --> 00:39:55.968]  And the fact is that he has more support now, and this is what the Republican establishment was whispering into Ron DeSantis' ear.
[00:39:56.008 --> 00:39:59.251]  They were telling him, once the indictments start, his support is going to collapse.
[00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:03.054]  And that's what Kevin McCarthy thought after January 6th, the most unfeasible process.
[00:40:03.074 --> 00:40:07.498]  Well, didn't McCarthy show his ass quitting to try to give the majority to the Democrats?
[00:40:07.878 --> 00:40:09.219]  He really showed he's a bad guy.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:15.805]  Well, before that, he called on President Trump to resign after January 6th, then he denied that he said that.
[00:40:15.885 --> 00:40:16.626]  That was caught on tape.
[00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:22.144]  Then he came out on the floor of the House and said that President Trump bears responsibility.
[00:40:22.365 --> 00:40:25.168]  He is the one who called for the January 6th Commission.
[00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:30.433]  And then he also called for other members of Congress, Matt Gaetz included, to be suspended from Twitter.
[00:40:30.453 --> 00:40:30.794]  That's right.
[00:40:30.894 --> 00:40:35.579]  And other deep state lefty men, as long as he was the Speaker, but he was ordered to leave when he had no power.
[00:40:37.165 --> 00:40:51.050]  Well, I think Matt Gaetz, you know, him and the Freedom Caucus, the small group of America First patriots basically forced him out and now he is resigning because he doesn't have the power so who knows what he's going to be a consultant.
[00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:51.410]  No, I agree.
[00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.851]  So let me ask you this, Mark, guys.
[00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.472]  What's the people's secret weapon?
[00:40:54.792 --> 00:40:56.192]  What's the deep state's secret weapon?
[00:40:56.212 --> 00:40:58.233]  What can we do to change this and what are they going to pull?
[00:41:00.495 --> 00:41:01.976]  We have to strike while the iron's hot.
[00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:03.537]  And the iron's hot now.
[00:41:03.737 --> 00:41:05.098]  And we have them scared.
[00:41:05.318 --> 00:41:07.320]  We are making tremendous headway.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.222]  No matter how much they attack Donald Trump, it's only increasing his support.
[00:41:11.463 --> 00:41:17.547]  The Republican establishment and the deep state tried to whisper sweet nothings into Ron DeSantis' ear to get him to come in.
[00:41:17.827 --> 00:41:18.848]  That only backfired.
[00:41:18.888 --> 00:41:20.229]  He's looking like a total failure.
[00:41:20.509 --> 00:41:21.850]  He's tarnished his entire image.
[00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:22.810]  He should have waited until 2028.
[00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.393]  He tried to basically stab Donald Trump in the back.
[00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:29.415]  I like him as governor, but it's him getting in.
[00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:32.036]  Is only trying to hurt Donald Trump.
[00:41:32.596 --> 00:41:39.979]  And so we have tremendous momentum now and with rumble and now with X with you back.
[00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:46.761]  It's galvanizing the free speech movement despite them demonizing Donald Trump for four years during his administration in 2020.
[00:41:47.302 --> 00:41:53.224]  He got more of the black vote despite them calling him a white supremacist and Nazi every single day so their lives aren't working.
[00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.465]  And we have the independent channels.
[00:41:55.866 --> 00:41:58.708]  After the 2016 election, the empire struck back.
[00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:08.575]  We used social media at that time, which was still seen as largely a novelty, even though President Obama was the first president to have a social media account on Twitter and on Facebook.
[00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:12.317]  But in 2016, it became more than a novelty.
[00:42:12.677 --> 00:42:19.677]   It became a social information warfare tool that we were using to spread the word organically.
[00:42:19.677 --> 00:42:24.536]   And that's why then the legacy media co-opted it right after that, the supposed war on fake
[00:42:24.536 --> 00:42:29.356]   news, which was a war on real news by Hillary Clinton and the fake news being spread through
[00:42:29.356 --> 00:42:30.356]  Facebook.
[00:42:30.356 --> 00:42:33.737]   First it was from the Macedonian teenagers just spreading click bait trying to get Google
[00:42:33.737 --> 00:42:35.097]  AdSense money.
[00:42:35.097 --> 00:42:38.696]  Then they concocted the Russia conspiracy theory.
[00:42:38.696 --> 00:42:39.696]  So then they took it back.
[00:42:39.696 --> 00:42:41.297]  They changed all the algorithms.
[00:42:41.297 --> 00:42:42.696]  They started shadow banning.
[00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:43.696]  They started.
[00:42:43.696 --> 00:42:48.978]   I know you got to go, but I want you to finish this up and also talk about the war on conservatives
[00:42:48.978 --> 00:42:51.657]  by Mark Dice, which is already a number four bestseller.
[00:42:51.994 --> 00:42:52.914]  Let's push it number one.
[00:42:52.954 --> 00:42:56.696]  Back in two minutes, we can finish up on the book and your other great analysis.
[00:42:56.716 --> 00:42:58.317]  One of the smartest guys out there, Mark Dice.
[00:42:58.737 --> 00:43:03.319]  And he was the guy, when I first got banned five years ago, everybody else ran, almost everybody.
[00:43:03.639 --> 00:43:04.420]  Mark Dice didn't.
[00:43:05.305 --> 00:43:05.825]  Day one.
[00:43:05.865 --> 00:43:07.506]  He could have gotten banned.
[00:43:07.526 --> 00:43:08.526]  He did get censored for it.
[00:43:08.846 --> 00:43:09.387]  He was there.
[00:43:09.707 --> 00:43:10.527]  That's a real guy.
[00:43:10.607 --> 00:43:11.147]  Mark Dice.
[00:43:11.187 --> 00:43:12.108]  Follow him and support him.
[00:43:12.128 --> 00:43:13.148]  All right.
[00:43:13.188 --> 00:43:14.609]  About 15 minutes left with Mark Dice.
[00:43:14.689 --> 00:43:16.269]  I'll cover a bunch of other news I haven't hit yet.
[00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.850]  Chase Geyser is set to come in 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:19.831]  Central here on the live feed.
[00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.331]  Central time.
[00:43:21.592 --> 00:43:23.592]  Mark, I've got a bunch of questions next segment that's longer.
[00:43:23.612 --> 00:43:25.213]  A bunch of stations that don't carry this segment.
[00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:25.453]  Join us.
[00:43:25.473 --> 00:43:26.153]  But we're on the internet.
[00:43:26.213 --> 00:43:27.114]  Reaching millions of people still.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.041]  I asked you during the break, what do you want next?
[00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:33.403]  And I kind of cut you off because Elon did.
[00:43:33.803 --> 00:43:35.725]  So let's not be like them, but I get your point.
[00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:42.469]  You were saying by their rules, CNN should be banned for fake news and censorship and bullying, particularly bullying.
[00:43:42.509 --> 00:43:43.830]  So let's drill into that a little bit.
[00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:45.849]  Well, I didn't say banned.
[00:43:46.049 --> 00:44:05.518]  I think that Elon should not even suspend them, but there is a tweet from CNN that does violate the Terms of Service, and I thought it would be a very symbolic victory to coincide with restoring you by applying the rules fairly to CNN, who did violate the Terms of Service against privacy violations and doxing.
[00:44:06.218 --> 00:44:15.913]  There was a woman back several years ago who shared something on Facebook that originated with a Russian troll farm and it was an event that she had shared with her friend.
[00:44:15.933 --> 00:44:17.957]  They came to her house in Florida and harassed her.
[00:44:18.928 --> 00:44:26.752]  Yeah, in her front yard, unannounced, this poor old lady, 75 years old, in her front yard harassing her about sharing something on Facebook.
[00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:38.017]  Which, by the way, Michael Moore was duped by a Russian bot farm Facebook post, an event as well, and showed up to a protest at Trump Tower that was organized literally by the Russians.
[00:44:38.037 --> 00:44:42.379]  So CNN showed up to this poor old lady's house when she was doing gardening out in the front yard.
[00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:52.178]  To suspend CNN or to apply the rules fair to pull that tweet because what they did is they uploaded the video to Twitter.
[00:44:52.519 --> 00:44:56.703]  That's not to X now showing them berating her, which you'd argue.
[00:44:56.803 --> 00:44:57.104]  Okay.
[00:44:57.364 --> 00:45:00.867]  It's maybe they're on the sidewalk and they're not technically on her property.
[00:45:00.887 --> 00:45:03.230]  But as she walks away and goes into her front yard.
[00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:10.073]  You can see her address on the number plate on her house, and that video is on Twitter.
[00:45:10.413 --> 00:45:12.194]  That's a violation of the terms of service.
[00:45:12.254 --> 00:45:13.114]  That is doxxing.
[00:45:13.134 --> 00:45:15.936]  You're not allowed to show up to somebody's house and then show their address.
[00:45:16.196 --> 00:45:19.557]  You could even argue that they're allowed to show up to their house and try to talk to somebody.
[00:45:19.577 --> 00:45:20.697]  You know, people have done that.
[00:45:20.737 --> 00:45:24.159]  Jesse Watters has done that with a lot of judges before he kind of went soft.
[00:45:24.419 --> 00:45:33.102]  He would actually show up to judges' houses and find them in the grocery store parking lot and confront them about the soft sentences that they would give to child predators.
[00:45:33.482 --> 00:45:41.486]  And so even if you're going to argue that that was fine, that that's not technically harassment or doxing, they did show her address and that is doxing.
[00:45:41.506 --> 00:45:43.207]  And so I think it would be a symbolic victory.
[00:45:43.467 --> 00:45:49.470]  Maybe I'll tweet it out later again to tag CrossFit Safety to take that tweet down.
[00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.852]  Not to suspend them, not to ban them, but you know what?
[00:45:52.872 --> 00:45:56.854]  Just to acknowledge that CNN did violate the Terms of Service.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.481]  And let's remove one of their tweets.
[00:45:59.802 --> 00:46:01.203]  Let's give them a taste of their own medicine.
[00:46:01.223 --> 00:46:06.626]  And I think that sometimes we have to do that because conservatives tend to just point out, oh, that's not fair.
[00:46:06.906 --> 00:46:10.329]  That's hypocrisy and trying to be a little bit too soft sometimes.
[00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:11.790]  So we don't want to compromise our principles.
[00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:21.017]  But sometimes I think we should apply the same standards they're forcing on us to them until there's some kind of a truce where we could say, see?
[00:46:21.237 --> 00:46:23.297]  Oh, now you don't like a taste of your own medicine.
[00:46:23.477 --> 00:46:24.958]  Okay, so now you want to back off?
[00:46:25.178 --> 00:46:27.098]  Are we ready to just kind of call it even now?
[00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:28.739]  And then we can move forward.
[00:46:28.779 --> 00:46:30.539]  So I think sometimes that's the way to do it.
[00:46:30.799 --> 00:46:32.119]  And it would send a tremendous message.
[00:46:32.599 --> 00:46:42.682]   CNN suspended or having a post deemed officially by Twitter violated the terms of service Just to give them a taste of their own medicine and a symbolic victory.
[00:46:42.762 --> 00:46:44.043]  Okay, it was six minutes ago.
[00:46:44.083 --> 00:46:46.104]  We're doing a two-minute break and I said, what do you want to hit next?
[00:46:46.144 --> 00:46:46.684]  Now I forgot.
[00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:47.484]  It was something important.
[00:46:47.824 --> 00:46:48.905]  What was I going to ask you next?
[00:46:50.326 --> 00:46:53.147]  The Operation Mockingbird division about publishing.
[00:46:54.347 --> 00:46:54.827]  That was it.
[00:46:54.847 --> 00:47:01.390]  So we're going to hit Mockingbird and we're going to hit a couple other subjects with Mark Dice.
[00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:02.351]  People need to get his book.
[00:47:02.391 --> 00:47:02.971]  It's amazing.
[00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:04.892]  The War on Conservatives by Mark Dice.
[00:47:04.932 --> 00:47:05.852]  It went to number four.
[00:47:06.272 --> 00:47:07.513]  And I want to explain something to listeners.
[00:47:09.406 --> 00:47:10.487]  It's an information war.
[00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:13.388]  When something goes to number one, it gets ten times bigger.
[00:47:13.468 --> 00:47:14.668]  It's an info war.
[00:47:15.189 --> 00:47:17.790]  I know you know about the War on Conservatives, but you'll learn something from this book.
[00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.171]  This guy's in the trenches.
[00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:20.871]  He didn't back down when everybody else did.
[00:47:21.212 --> 00:47:22.492]  Get the book now.
[00:47:22.892 --> 00:47:23.993]  The War on Conservatives.
[00:47:24.053 --> 00:47:24.593]  Mark Dice.
[00:47:24.713 --> 00:47:25.634]  Get it at Amazon.
[00:47:25.894 --> 00:47:28.095]  Push the damn thing to number one and through the top.
[00:47:29.156 --> 00:47:33.280]  All right, we'll be right back with Mark Dyer's final segment of a bunch of the news straight ahead.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.123]  I'm with InfoWars.com in case you hadn't heard of it.
[00:47:36.463 --> 00:47:38.445]  And now back on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[00:47:38.845 --> 00:47:39.686]  Be sure and follow us there.
[00:47:39.706 --> 00:47:41.347]  We'll be 2 million followers in the next few hours.
[00:47:42.361 --> 00:47:47.984]  All right, Mark Dice is our guest for one more segment, and I got a bunch of military, economic, political news.
[00:47:48.724 --> 00:47:51.806]  I did interview Elon Musk for two plus hours on X today.
[00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.407]  I'm told it's downloaded now.
[00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:55.928]  It'll be up in the next 10 minutes at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:56.409 --> 00:47:57.209]  Bandai video.
[00:47:57.229 --> 00:47:58.970]  We'll be playing clips of it tomorrow on the show.
[00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:00.911]  Just absolutely insane.
[00:48:00.931 --> 00:48:03.893]  The media, the control over media cannot even ignore this.
[00:48:03.913 --> 00:48:04.833]  They're going to go crazy.
[00:48:06.314 --> 00:48:07.435]  We asked some of the best questions.
[00:48:07.455 --> 00:48:08.275]  So did Mark Dice.
[00:48:08.855 --> 00:48:09.736]  So did Andrew Tate.
[00:48:09.756 --> 00:48:10.656]  So did Tristan Tate.
[00:48:10.716 --> 00:48:12.937]   So did Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:48:13.017 --> 00:48:15.739]  I mean, it just went on and on.
[00:48:15.819 --> 00:48:16.879]  General Flynn was there.
[00:48:16.899 --> 00:48:19.480]  It just went on and on.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.821]  But Mark, I gotta bring this up to you because I never asked you this.
[00:48:22.201 --> 00:48:27.484]  I've known you 18 years, like you said, doing great down the street stuff, writing books back then.
[00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:28.524]  I was like, I gotta get this guy on.
[00:48:28.564 --> 00:48:29.685]  So I didn't launch your career.
[00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:30.565]  You're already doing a great job.
[00:48:30.905 --> 00:48:31.685]  I may have boosted it.
[00:48:32.466 --> 00:48:37.948]  But I noticed when I got banned five years ago, including most of my own crew, most of them are gone now.
[00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.509]  Owen was here, but he never did it.
[00:48:40.538 --> 00:48:43.201]  They suddenly didn't want to talk about Infowars on air.
[00:48:43.562 --> 00:48:46.025]  They wanted to keep their own sites we'd promoted and built up.
[00:48:46.345 --> 00:48:47.226]  I kind of let them do it.
[00:48:47.266 --> 00:48:48.948]  They all kind of just moved on.
[00:48:49.749 --> 00:48:58.941]  What was it with you, the winner patriot, you know, not the sunshine patriot, but the winner patriot?
[00:49:00.305 --> 00:49:19.029]  What was it when you saw me get banned five years ago that made you go from, I want to say competition, but you're like, hey, I got my thing, you got yours, you're playing too much of my stuff on there, that's mine, I'm not mad, but you were kind of like, I'm on guard, Jones, don't, you know, to you like absolutely defending me.
[00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:24.470]  What was the thought process, which is a good instinct, I think, but I want to talk about what was your instinct there, why'd you do that?
[00:49:26.331 --> 00:49:47.876]   Well, as a media analyst and somebody who, you know, is really a first-generation person who saw the creation, the advent of social media and saw it become such a central focus in our lives and in our culture, when you were banned, it sent shockwaves through The community because it was the ultimate unpersoning and it was unfair and I followed your career very closely because I consider you a friend.
[00:49:47.936 --> 00:49:51.561]  I consider Alex, like I said, it did boost my career.
[00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:54.304]  I've been a regular on the show since 2005.
[00:49:54.865 --> 00:49:56.867]  Alex has been a tremendous inspiration for me.
[00:49:58.123 --> 00:50:02.785]  An annual guest for 18 years now, and so part of it is, I took it personally.
[00:50:03.065 --> 00:50:13.390]  It was I saw a friend of mine getting banned unfairly, who didn't violate the terms, and then I saw the media smearing you and putting out fake news for this supposed reason.
[00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:18.132]  And so we've already covered why it was on Twitter, his confrontation, conversation with Oliver Darcy.
[00:50:18.372 --> 00:50:26.276]  So I must add, Alex was actually fairly well-behaved and contained himself being face-to-face with such scum, but even before that, Twitter held out.
[00:50:26.816 --> 00:50:30.422]  When you were on person for just about everything at the same time.
[00:50:30.983 --> 00:50:34.489]  It wasn't because of the comments about the school tragedy from years earlier.
[00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.531]  It was literally...
[00:50:36.229 --> 00:50:37.270]  I'll follow this so closely.
[00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.452]  It was criticizing Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:50:39.572 --> 00:50:45.958]  This was, you know, 2018 when very few people talk about Drag Queen Story Hour and Alex is ranting about how despicable it is and how weird it is.
[00:50:46.438 --> 00:50:48.760]  They consider that to be hate speech against the protected groups.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.561]  That was strike one.
[00:50:50.002 --> 00:50:56.868]  Strike two was he was talking about the Islamization of Europe and the increasing crime rates over in Europe because of the mass influx of all the migrants.
[00:50:57.368 --> 00:50:58.529]  That was hate speech as well.
[00:50:58.969 --> 00:50:59.950]  That was strike number two.
[00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:04.033]  Strike number three was because he was suspended.
[00:51:04.053 --> 00:51:07.656]  You can't live stream on YouTube when you're suspended for two weeks.
[00:51:08.196 --> 00:51:11.519]  So he live streamed his show on somebody else's channel.
[00:51:11.539 --> 00:51:16.442]  I think it was a guest or a guest host or an affiliate on another channel.
[00:51:16.823 --> 00:51:20.605]  They said that was ban evasion strike number three.
[00:51:20.645 --> 00:51:23.828]  So it's the principle of free speech.
[00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:25.329]  You're banned unfairly.
[00:51:26.078 --> 00:51:26.858]  You were maligned.
[00:51:27.138 --> 00:51:36.281]  They tried to define you by a mistake and by a flaw and overlook the genius of Alex Jones.
[00:51:36.522 --> 00:51:55.688]  And the reason that they really did ban, of course, is because Alex Jones is a wrecking ball against the establishment and was waking so many people up and getting so many people to start questioning what it is that's going on in the deep state, in the liberal media, in the fake news industrial complex.
[00:51:56.485 --> 00:52:00.308]  And so I took it personally as a media analyst.
[00:52:00.388 --> 00:52:01.048]  I was very upset.
[00:52:01.128 --> 00:52:03.089]  I saw this setting a terrible precedent.
[00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:09.974]  And since I knew you and I had followed your career very closely, I knew that what they were saying was the reason was false.
[00:52:10.814 --> 00:52:14.520]   And, um, You know, I stand up for friends.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:20.601]  Well, I never forget that, and I've seen you a thousand times defend me, so that's why here tonight, front and center, I want to promote you.
[00:52:20.942 --> 00:52:21.962]  Plus the book's amazing.
[00:52:22.002 --> 00:52:27.944]  So talk about Operation Mockingbird, which we're seeing 2.0 right now, that you really cover in the new book, The World Conservatives.
[00:52:27.964 --> 00:52:28.784]  This is important to know.
[00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:37.532]  Yeah, people talk about fake news and the deep state and them manipulating the media, but it's really, it's an admitted program.
[00:52:37.592 --> 00:52:48.575]  And for those who know, I sound like I'm belaboring the point, but the fact that Operation Mockingbird is not widely known, that very few people, the mainstream pundits... By the way, to interrupt you, that's key.
[00:52:48.855 --> 00:52:50.216]  The audience and you know that.
[00:52:50.236 --> 00:52:51.416]  That was very astute.
[00:52:51.456 --> 00:52:54.037]  The general public still doesn't know the CIA is manipulating us.
[00:52:55.149 --> 00:53:07.436]  They don't know that Operation Mockingbird was uncovered in the 1970s in a congressional hearing, there's clips of it, where they were literally paying the media to act as gatekeepers and propagandists to act and to function for the government.
[00:53:07.476 --> 00:53:15.741]  Now back then, they claimed, and it may actually, at the time, may have been for a good cause, at least some of it, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:19.163]  So they said back then, it started in the 1950s, was to fight communism.
[00:53:19.203 --> 00:53:28.429]   So what they would do is they would invite reporters, editors, The network heads to dinner that haven't signed an NDA before they were going to tell them what they're going to talk about.
[00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:31.130]  And then they would tell them, hey, here's what it is that's going on.
[00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.511]  We want you to promote these things.
[00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:38.675]  And then they had they had a back channel about what it is that they wanted them to promote, what it is that they wanted to not to talk about.
[00:53:38.695 --> 00:53:44.158]  By the way, seven, eight years ago, Chris Carter told me personally on the phone he had those meetings with the CIA of exiles.
[00:53:44.318 --> 00:53:44.579]  Sorry.
[00:53:45.899 --> 00:53:46.800]  Well, that's a whole other division.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:55.289]  That's like an open secret as well, the Entertainment Liaison Office, where I'm the CIA's own website, and I cover this in my book, Hollywood Propaganda, how TV movies and music shape our culture.
[00:53:55.648 --> 00:54:00.848]   Like if you're a producer in Hollywood, they will literally work with the government
[00:54:00.848 --> 00:54:05.969]   to make films and provide equipment, provide script approval, access to military bases
[00:54:05.969 --> 00:54:09.007]   in order to use that as propaganda, but they have to control the narrative
[00:54:09.007 --> 00:54:12.248]  in order to paint the CIA as a fun, friendly organization.
[00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.929]  They never do anything wrong.
[00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:18.327]  And so it's this kind of weird bedfellow that Hollywood has.
[00:54:18.327 --> 00:54:21.449]   'Cause sometimes they're against the wars, but at the same time, they work behind the scenes
[00:54:21.449 --> 00:54:25.728]   with the Department of Defense and with the CIA to produce popular films.
[00:54:25.728 --> 00:54:31.228]   And they're such nitpicking about it because even in the film,
[00:54:31.228 --> 00:54:35.489]  what was it with Robert De Niro, "Meet the Parents."
[00:54:35.489 --> 00:54:36.327]  Okay, he was a CIA officer.
[00:54:36.327 --> 00:54:38.248]  He's also the Good Shepherd, Robert De Niro produced.
[00:54:38.248 --> 00:54:39.808]  But yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[00:54:39.808 --> 00:54:41.708]  So in "Meet the Parents,"
[00:54:41.708 --> 00:54:48.929]   Robert De Niro is a former CIA officer and there was a scene in there when Ben,
[00:54:48.929 --> 00:54:52.507]   the star goes into his secret office and is looking through his books
[00:54:52.507 --> 00:54:55.728]  and sees torture manual, CIA torture manual.
[00:54:55.728 --> 00:54:57.248]  And so they had that removed.
[00:54:57.248 --> 00:55:02.048]   And because there were consultants on the film about, oh, how do we portray a CIA officer?
[00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:04.969]   And so they had that removed because it makes the CIA look bad.
[00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:13.621]   So my point is, I want everybody outside of this audience, the mainstream pundits, we're going to encourage them politely to talk about Operation Mockingbird.
[00:55:13.641 --> 00:55:15.182]  And it's not just in the media.
[00:55:16.642 --> 00:55:22.826]  In my previous books, I talk about how Operation Mockingbird is not just in the newspapers and in the broadcast news.
[00:55:23.426 --> 00:55:37.853]   The congressional hearing, the church committee hearing, and in the congressional report, they admit that there was an entire book publishing division because books, they admit, are the most powerful an influential form of media. More than a television show,
[00:55:37.853 --> 00:55:42.483]   more than a movie, you can listen to a radio broadcast, you can read a newspaper
[00:55:42.483 --> 00:55:47.983]   article. Very rarely is it going to change your life, is it going to change your paradigm. But
[00:55:47.983 --> 00:55:53.494]   a book, if you sit down and read a book, you're talking about a 10-hour personal intimate
[00:55:53.494 --> 00:55:59.623]   conversation with an author. And that's why I don't like doing interviews because I stumble over my
[00:55:59.623 --> 00:56:00.333]  words.
[00:56:00.522 --> 00:56:01.503]  I think I'm a better writer.
[00:56:01.523 --> 00:56:03.345]  I just stumble over my words there.
[00:56:03.565 --> 00:56:10.172]  But in the books, my books, I can polish and repolish and add and they grow and cite everything.
[00:56:10.192 --> 00:56:16.498]  There's over 900 footnotes in these books because in a book you can really put together a quality presentation.
[00:56:16.538 --> 00:56:24.789]   So the Operation Mockingbird Publishing Division admits that they funded books And they would use trusts and all these ways to hide who it was.
[00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:28.292]  They didn't care if they were commercially viable because they just wanted them to be out there.
[00:56:28.632 --> 00:56:31.474]  They'd have book excerpts published in American magazines.
[00:56:31.815 --> 00:56:35.838]  And this is why books like Cassidy Hutchinson all of a sudden gets a book deal.
[00:56:36.198 --> 00:56:46.567]  She's that, I don't want to call her a babe, but she's the wannabe babe, the portrayed babe that claimed that Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of the car to force the driver to take him to the Capitol.
[00:56:47.227 --> 00:56:58.420]   And you have even people like Edward Bernstein, or the former Bernstein and, what's his name, the Watergate guys, right?
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:00.541]  Wolbert and Bernstein.
[00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:01.381]  Yes.
[00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:18.253]   Now, they, instead of beating Operation Mockingbird, they joined them because they wrote an article in Rolling Stone back in the 1970s exposing Operation Mockingbird and even saying that the hearing itself The Church Committee was a limited hangout.
[00:57:18.293 --> 00:57:22.776]  They actually prevented the extent of the manipulation from being known.
[00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:30.062]  Now, he went from that to now being Operation Mockingbird, to trying to tape down Donald Trump.
[00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:44.646]   Now, even if they were well-intended, like I said back in the 1950s, to try to stop communism, Just the fact that that mechanism exists, and they have them sign the NDAs, we know that there was a program to deny that it still exists today is ridiculous.
[00:57:44.926 --> 00:57:57.394]  But you have people like Woodward and Bernstein who couldn't beat them, and so they joined them, making millions of dollars with their book deals, with their CIA sources, leaking information to them.
[00:57:57.834 --> 00:58:07.139]  Really, they are willing servants of the system, but at the same time, they're also dupes, because they're fed supposed classified information.
[00:58:07.179 --> 00:58:19.985]  They're fed supposed leaks from their intelligence agency sources, which are feeding them sometimes real information, sometimes disinformation, in order to use that to weaponize against President Trump.
[00:58:21.826 --> 00:58:26.271]  Chuck Schumer, who knows, I mean, he's one of the most powerful senators in the country.
[00:58:26.551 --> 00:58:38.023]  He knows the extent of the intelligence agencies, and he couldn't help himself but brag that the intelligence agencies have six ways to Sunday to take somebody down.
[00:58:38.043 --> 00:58:43.148]  And that was, I forget what year, but that was early, early in the Trump administration.
[00:58:43.468 --> 00:58:57.355]   And we saw what happened with the You know, the impeachment inquiry, which ties in with censorship because you couldn't even mention the name of the whistleblower, the Deep State operative, who kicked that off.
[00:58:57.895 --> 00:59:06.478]  And then even Senator Rand Paul was censored mentioning the name on the floor of the Senate because that clip was posted on his YouTube channel.
[00:59:06.758 --> 00:59:14.601]  So you have the big tech platforms allowed anyone and everyone to smear Donald Trump, to incite violence against him.
[00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:22.829]   to defame him in every way possible, but just mentioning the name of a whistleblower.
[00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:27.068]   Not posting his address, not even posting photos of him. He works for the government.
[00:59:27.068 --> 00:59:34.028]   He is a public official. Eric Caramello, I believe is his name. And so they suppressed that name
[00:59:34.028 --> 00:59:39.709]   from even being said. And so the fact that Donald Trump has now been allowed back on Twitter,
[00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:43.469]   not only Twitter, on X, they restored his YouTube channel as well.
[00:59:44.323 --> 00:59:49.529]  And so I think they started to get a little concerned that they were pushing the envelope a little too far.
[00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:52.774]  Everybody just started to see that their plan was so obvious.
[00:59:53.448 --> 00:59:58.932]  That we were becoming a communist state where you can't even question the outcome of an election?
[00:59:59.613 --> 01:00:02.195]  You're not even allowed to have a First Amendment right?
[01:00:02.455 --> 01:00:10.201]  You can't mention the name of a government official that kicked off an impeachment inquiry because that is considered to be harassment?
[01:00:10.661 --> 01:00:11.442]  Give me a break.
[01:00:11.602 --> 01:00:11.962]  That's right.
[01:00:12.002 --> 01:00:13.424]  You can't face your accuser.
[01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:14.625]  That's in the Constitution.
[01:00:15.325 --> 01:00:17.727]  The bill of rights that if somebody accused you, you can face them.
[01:00:18.007 --> 01:00:20.630]  Oh, we can't say who the source was.
[01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:22.051]  That's harassment.
[01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:24.453]  So super, super dangerous.
[01:00:24.513 --> 01:00:24.854]  All right.
[01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:27.576]  People need to get the war on conservatives.
[01:00:28.096 --> 01:00:30.118]  Mark Dias, give us your gut level prediction.
[01:00:30.138 --> 01:00:31.279]  We're not going to hold you to it.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.325]  But the next 11 months for this election, what are you just dead reckoning things going to happen?
[01:00:39.116 --> 01:00:40.017]  I have concerns.
[01:00:40.077 --> 01:00:40.857]  I have fears.
[01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:42.158]  I try not to give into them.
[01:00:42.258 --> 01:00:48.643]  It's the natural instinct to, you know, sort of think of worst possible scenarios in order to protect yourselves from them.
[01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:51.665]  We talked about some of them in the beginning of the show.
[01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:57.909]  I don't want to make any predictions, but there are, like Elon said during the Twitter space, there are probabilities.
[01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.010]  There are possibilities.
[01:01:00.827 --> 01:01:06.273]  All of the ones that I see lead to a tremendously difficult time coming ahead.
[01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.916]  They're trying to throw President Trump in prison.
[01:01:09.297 --> 01:01:10.818]  They may actually do it.
[01:01:11.439 --> 01:01:16.204]  He may be in prison or confined to a military base during the election and win.
[01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:24.896]  And then the issue is going to be, are they going to allow him to be sworn in remotely or have surrogates come in and swear him in?
[01:01:25.217 --> 01:01:28.840]  And we're in a collapsing empire, folks, so you better be prepared.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.663]  And I don't want to say, like, about, you know, an armed rebellion.
[01:01:31.683 --> 01:01:42.053]  I say emotionally prepared, psychologically prepared, thinking locally, family, friends, community, church, get ready.
[01:01:42.848 --> 01:01:55.179]  And we can't be swept up and you can't be getting too caught up in the fear and mouthing off and saying stupid things that, you know, maybe amongst friends, your friends would know that you wouldn't mean because that's how people are going to get arrested.
[01:01:55.199 --> 01:01:56.240]  People are going to get in trouble.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:08.230]  We're facing a very difficult time when we have people being arrested and sentenced to seven months in prison for posting memes like Douglas Mackey, Owen Schroer being sentenced to prison for exercising his First Amendment right.
[01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.412]  I want everybody to just be careful, be calm.
[01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:16.683]  Think about your words carefully, what you say, what you post, and, you know, just God bless you.
[01:02:16.743 --> 01:02:18.944]  No, no, no, exactly, because we're in a real war.
[01:02:18.964 --> 01:02:22.605]  This is not patty cake, this isn't make-believe, this isn't musical chairs.
[01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:24.986]  This is war against a dying evil empire.
[01:02:25.006 --> 01:02:26.826]  We shouldn't lie to people.
[01:02:26.866 --> 01:02:28.067]  This is extremely dangerous.
[01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:34.276]  Yeah, and watch your analogies, watch your figure of speech, because they'll take anything and everything out of context.
[01:02:34.316 --> 01:02:38.680]  They claim that you were being literal, so everyone, my main advice is to be careful.
[01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.602]  Focus on friends, family, locally.
[01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:54.983]   No matter what happens with the country nationally, locally, your community, even if it's just your neighborhood, your local school, that will be able, and what we should also do, By focusing locally, take over the school boards, take over the city councils.
[01:02:55.363 --> 01:02:56.183]  It's a lot easier than you think.
[01:02:56.203 --> 01:02:58.544]  Yeah, notice how they sent the FBI in two years ago.
[01:02:58.564 --> 01:03:02.846]  They were so scared of us, just peacefully speaking out and taking over.
[01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:10.132]  There's a lot of competition on a national level when you're talking about races, even, you know, for governor or for Senate, for Congress.
[01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:11.713]  But we're talking about a school board?
[01:03:11.733 --> 01:03:15.316]  I mean, we're seeing some very small margins.
[01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:22.421]  There was, I don't know where it was, but there was just an issue where somebody lost the local office to one vote because he didn't vote for himself.
[01:03:22.461 --> 01:03:24.142]  He just didn't feel comfortable voting for himself.
[01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:30.386]  And President Trump only won in 2016, I think by just tens, a few tens of thousands of votes.
[01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:35.240]  And so it just depends on the different areas you can get to vote for.
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:41.328]  And even if the country goes to hell in a handbasket, you can get your school board, you can get your sheriff.
[01:03:41.648 --> 01:03:52.552]   Because again, I mentioned this before, I'll reinforce it, during the COVID lockdowns, even in counties in Los Angeles, Sheriffs were not enforcing Governor Newsom's lockdown orders.
[01:03:52.572 --> 01:03:53.613]  That's right.
[01:03:53.953 --> 01:03:55.334]  It's time to stop following orders.
[01:03:55.434 --> 01:03:56.975]  Alright, the book is The World Conservatives.
[01:03:57.556 --> 01:03:58.516]  Amazon.com.
[01:03:58.536 --> 01:04:00.338]  I want to send it to number one.
[01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:02.639]  Mark Dice, thank you so much.
[01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:03.660]  Really amazing.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.103]  And thanks for being a real American, but it's good to know who's actually on our side.
[01:04:07.123 --> 01:04:08.924]  Appreciate it.
[01:04:09.144 --> 01:04:09.945]  Glad to see you back.
[01:04:10.481 --> 01:04:11.962]  Look forward to everything that you're going to do.
[01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:14.604]  Have a good Christmas, Happy New Year, and buckle up, everybody.
[01:04:14.624 --> 01:04:15.645]  It's going to be intense.
[01:04:16.046 --> 01:04:16.506]  Buckle up.
[01:04:17.046 --> 01:04:19.348]  The war on conservatives, Mark Dice, only made 18 years.
[01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:22.671]  The real deal, when almost no one would support it.
[01:04:23.472 --> 01:04:24.192]  I don't forget that.
[01:04:24.853 --> 01:04:29.197]  I said today, because we got a lot of folks on the show, and I said, I want Mark Dice first.
[01:04:30.377 --> 01:04:31.999]  And of course, he's like, well, I'm a little busy.
[01:04:32.019 --> 01:04:33.280]  And I said, knock it off, man.
[01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:35.422]  Just get on the damn show.
[01:04:36.801 --> 01:04:38.142]  So, he's a busy guy.
[01:04:38.162 --> 01:04:42.023]  He has businesses and everything else, but we need people like Mark Dice and we appreciate it.
[01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:43.104]  All right, we're gonna go to break here.
[01:04:43.124 --> 01:04:46.385]  I already skipped the break, but I want to hear the special reporters supporting.
[01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:51.968]  I'm gonna come back and drill through all this news, but I'm telling you folks, I don't hype stuff up for no reason.
[01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:54.289]  You know, if I tell you something's big, it's big.
[01:04:54.329 --> 01:04:57.110]  In fact, most of them I say, coming up, and I go ahead and tell you right away.
[01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:58.551]  I'm the opposite of a hype guy.
[01:04:58.571 --> 01:04:59.451]  I just can't help it.
[01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:00.752]  I kind of shoot my wad right up front.
[01:05:01.974 --> 01:05:06.419]  This Elon Musk interview, supposedly me being interviewed by him, I said, forget Alex Jones.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.063]  Let's not talk about... Come on, please.
[01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:09.583]  Let's move on.
[01:05:10.024 --> 01:05:12.207]  You run like all this economic engine.
[01:05:12.247 --> 01:05:13.028]  Let's talk about you.
[01:05:13.068 --> 01:05:15.851]  And 70% of it is me asking them questions.
[01:05:16.432 --> 01:05:17.873]  That has already went out to millions.
[01:05:17.994 --> 01:05:19.576]  It's about to be on Infowars.com.
[01:05:19.936 --> 01:05:20.737]  It's not already there.
[01:05:21.778 --> 01:05:22.760]  So look for that tomorrow.
[01:05:23.161 --> 01:05:26.366]  Chase Geyser's coming up in about 35 minutes, 36 minutes.
[01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:32.477]  But here is a New World Order builds planetary suicide machine by Jian Bound.
[01:05:32.517 --> 01:05:33.258]  Very important report.
[01:05:33.077 --> 01:05:45.478]  Here it is.
[01:05:45.753 --> 01:05:46.313]  It's the cult.
[01:05:46.373 --> 01:05:47.534]  I mean, it's the cult of cults.
[01:05:48.534 --> 01:05:49.494]  It's the cult of truth.
[01:05:49.735 --> 01:05:52.596]  It is no different with the climate change cult.
[01:05:53.096 --> 01:06:00.860]  Many people who are in the middle of Manhattan and have maybe ever never been on the other side of the Hudson River... You know what, hit pause.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.901]  I rarely nail it wrong.
[01:06:02.981 --> 01:06:04.081]  I'm really good with these clocks.
[01:06:05.022 --> 01:06:07.804]  And I'm used to John Bowne reports being 4 minutes 50 seconds.
[01:06:08.304 --> 01:06:08.944]  I didn't look at this.
[01:06:08.984 --> 01:06:10.645]  I just thought, oh John Bowne is 5 minutes.
[01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:12.726]  It's 5 minutes 52 seconds.
[01:06:13.367 --> 01:06:14.027]  It's too important.
[01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:17.009]  I watched it before I went on today and I was like, this is incredibly important.
[01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:19.110]  So we're not cutting this short.
[01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.330]  We're not cutting a minute off of it.
[01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:23.812]  So you're stuck with me for 4 minutes before we got a break.
[01:06:25.313 --> 01:06:26.774]  But here's what I want to explain to people.
[01:06:28.823 --> 01:06:35.425]  I get attacked by the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, the CIA, the FBI, the British Intelligence and the Easter Bunny.
[01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:42.967]  But then I constantly see these attacks because I know people are waking up saying, oh, he's loyal opposition or he's controlled.
[01:06:43.247 --> 01:06:44.547]  They never show you proof, folks.
[01:06:45.147 --> 01:06:48.608]  Yeah, I'm controlled by the truth for 29 years on air.
[01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:52.299]  They're trying to tell you there aren't good people.
[01:06:52.419 --> 01:06:52.919]  You're good.
[01:06:53.319 --> 01:06:53.880]  You're watching.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.420]  You're listening.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.080]  You love God.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:55.860]  You love justice.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.561]  You know you're good.
[01:06:57.021 --> 01:06:59.042]  And I don't even give those people attacking any attention.
[01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:01.543]  Most of them are bots or on the enemy's side.
[01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:03.264]  But just, that's a lie, folks.
[01:07:03.864 --> 01:07:05.064]  I'm anti-abortion.
[01:07:05.124 --> 01:07:05.845]  I'm pro-God.
[01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:06.705]  I'm pro-America.
[01:07:06.785 --> 01:07:07.706]  I'm pro-sovereignty.
[01:07:08.106 --> 01:07:09.206]  I'm pro-capitalism.
[01:07:09.386 --> 01:07:10.767]  I am pro-medical freedom.
[01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:13.468]  And that's what I do 24-7.
[01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:19.712]  And I'm against taking your guns, 100%.
[01:07:19.792 --> 01:07:21.894]  I'm not against gun safety training.
[01:07:23.196 --> 01:07:25.418]  Which the media spends, oh, Jones is pro-anti-gun.
[01:07:25.478 --> 01:07:28.201]  No, I mean training people how to use a gun.
[01:07:29.622 --> 01:07:33.466]  Training people about gun safety and how to shoot and how to clean it, how to store it.
[01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:37.831]  They try to get rid of that at, you know, the public schools that still have it, the YMCA.
[01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:39.513]  And I notice how the enemy works.
[01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:50.008]  They'll come out and they'll say, oh, Jones is anti-establishment, and they'll say, oh, Jones is an FBI informant.
[01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:56.730]  Why, Jones, when they were trying to indict Owen Schroer, they had indicted Owen.
[01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:00.552]  They said, if you just give us your cell phone, we won't put him in jail.
[01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:02.912]  Now, my lawyers looked at my cell phone.
[01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:05.133]  I knew I wasn't involved in January 6th attack on the Capitol.
[01:08:05.693 --> 01:08:10.155]  So we sent them a letter back and said, yeah, you give us blanket immunity, we'll give you the cell phone because there's nothing on it.
[01:08:11.536 --> 01:08:15.679]  And they leaked it to the news saying Jones is offering the cell phone of Trump.
[01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:17.660]  Trump wasn't on the cell phone.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.521]  Hadn't talked to him in over a year.
[01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:21.842]  I had lawyers check the whole thing.
[01:08:22.463 --> 01:08:24.684]  I sat there and read hundreds of pages of text messages.
[01:08:24.724 --> 01:08:25.084]  Nothing there.
[01:08:27.646 --> 01:08:28.527]  And then they spin that.
[01:08:28.767 --> 01:08:29.607]  Oh, Jones!
[01:08:30.188 --> 01:08:31.028]  Remember all the headlines?
[01:08:31.048 --> 01:08:32.089]  New York Times, Washington Post.
[01:08:32.409 --> 01:08:33.510]  Jones has come out.
[01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:36.411]  He's going to turn state's evidence on January 6th.
[01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:41.732]   And I talked to him and I said, We're not going to give them the phone.
[01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:42.292]  They're screwing us.
[01:08:42.332 --> 01:08:43.353]  He's like, yeah, screw them.
[01:08:43.713 --> 01:08:44.754]  So they put Owen in jail.
[01:08:45.195 --> 01:08:45.875]  But he's out now.
[01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:48.838]  But I mean, that's how this works.
[01:08:49.418 --> 01:08:50.279]  The cop pulls you over.
[01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:50.919]  You're not drinking.
[01:08:50.959 --> 01:08:51.420]  Are you drinking?
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:51.700]  No.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.221]  That's not state evidence.
[01:08:53.782 --> 01:08:54.843]  I didn't work with the system.
[01:08:54.903 --> 01:08:55.823]  I wasn't with the man.
[01:08:56.744 --> 01:08:57.365]  Have you been drinking?
[01:08:57.405 --> 01:08:57.625]  No.
[01:08:58.185 --> 01:08:58.986]  Why'd you pull me over?
[01:08:59.346 --> 01:09:00.427]  Oh, you crossed the yellow line.
[01:09:00.467 --> 01:09:00.928]  Yeah, right.
[01:09:01.628 --> 01:09:02.989]  But that's how they work, folks.
[01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:06.532]  I see through roads colored darkly, as the Bible says.
[01:09:07.093 --> 01:09:08.914]  I don't have godlike omniscience or anything.
[01:09:09.355 --> 01:09:10.236]  One trillionth close to it.
[01:09:10.676 --> 01:09:12.557]  But I sure as hell love God and love justice.
[01:09:12.998 --> 01:09:13.698]  And I'm real.
[01:09:13.919 --> 01:09:16.261]  And the idea that we're not real...
[01:09:17.256 --> 01:09:21.818]  And the idea that we're not trying to turn things around is a lie.
[01:09:22.178 --> 01:09:24.780]  And so, question me, investigate me.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:35.004]  But you should really investigate the people, listen to me, that tell you I can't be trusted and I'm loyal opposition, I'm a fed with no evidence.
[01:09:35.825 --> 01:09:37.325]  Investigate me when they say that.
[01:09:38.126 --> 01:09:40.747]  But double investigate who are these people.
[01:09:41.647 --> 01:09:44.368]  Because I can tell you right now, I'm as real as it gets, and I know I am.
[01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:56.911]  And so that's just another message to you, because that's the last hurdle we gotta go over, is all these people that sit there and say that I work for the Vatican, or the Israelis, all this crap.
[01:09:57.451 --> 01:10:02.093]  I don't work for the Baptists, the Masons, the Israelis, the Vatican, or the Easter Bunny.
[01:10:02.553 --> 01:10:08.254]  I work for God and the truth, and we've been here 29 years, and Christ said, Judges read my truths.
[01:10:08.735 --> 01:10:09.795]  I'm not here defending myself.
[01:10:10.615 --> 01:10:14.839]  I just want you all to think about how the enemy tries to divert you.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.160]  So let's just do this.
[01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:17.161]  Let's say I'm a bad guy.
[01:10:17.322 --> 01:10:18.022]  Let's move on from that.
[01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:19.263]  You know you're good.
[01:10:19.524 --> 01:10:21.185]  Now take action against the New World Order.
[01:10:21.906 --> 01:10:23.608]  Well, the pig of the battle is here right now.
[01:10:25.339 --> 01:10:26.880]  And I was just talking to the crew during the break.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.301]  Man, this is a two plus hour interview with Elon Musk.
[01:10:29.702 --> 01:10:31.783]  We're trying to boil it down to 45 minutes for tomorrow.
[01:10:32.123 --> 01:10:36.005]  Chase Geyser takes over in like 35 minutes, 37 minutes, or 27 minutes.
[01:10:36.506 --> 01:10:38.367]  It is unbelievably powerful.
[01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.968]  I mean, Elon Musk has never said stuff like this.
[01:10:41.288 --> 01:10:43.269]  The New World Order wants to kill us, global government.
[01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.111]  They're going to crap their New World Order pants when this goes out.
[01:10:49.153 --> 01:10:52.575]  But I went to break late and couldn't play this clip.
[01:10:54.051 --> 01:10:56.400]  So here is John Bowne's latest clip.
[01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:58.488]  This is a really important report.
[01:10:58.929 --> 01:10:59.833]  It's a Bandai video.
[01:10:59.653 --> 01:11:11.813]  Here it is.
[01:11:12.187 --> 01:11:12.587]  It's the cult.
[01:11:12.687 --> 01:11:13.849]  I mean, it's the cult of cults.
[01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:15.831]  It's the cult of truth.
[01:11:16.051 --> 01:11:18.935]  It is no different with the climate change cult.
[01:11:19.415 --> 01:11:31.349]   Many people who are in the middle of Manhattan and have maybe ever never been on the other side of the Hudson River Uh, can have these ideas in their heads somehow, that we could eliminate fossil fuels.
[01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:33.511]  Well, it's a recipe for mass suicide.
[01:11:33.531 --> 01:11:46.445]  Uh, it's just quite amazing that someone that is in government, actually elected to the government of the United States of America, would propose that we eliminate all fossil fuels in 12 years.
[01:11:47.586 --> 01:11:57.249]  It would basically begin a process of cannibalization amongst the human species, because the food could not be delivered to the stores in the middle of the cities anymore.
[01:11:57.429 --> 01:12:11.333]  Recently, at the 28th Annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP28, Pope Francis issued an apostolic exhortation to fuel the climate crisis scion.
[01:12:11.573 --> 01:12:16.094]  These people won't stop until all life on planet Earth is no more.
[01:12:16.614 --> 01:12:29.065]  Are you seriously suggesting we should be pumping more stuff in, polluting the earth more, building more coal-fired power stations, just so we can make sure that the CO2 levels are good?
[01:12:29.685 --> 01:12:33.689]  No, I'm not, because we're putting plenty of CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:43.697]  We don't need to do it this quickly, but if we bring it up to a higher level than it is today, we will get immediately an increase in the growth of crops and trees, which is not a bad thing.
[01:12:44.718 --> 01:12:48.782]  The tendency to go in the rich countries to wind and solar is a giant waste of money.
[01:12:49.143 --> 01:13:01.055]  Those wind farms will rust in place and there is no fun to decommission them when they either wear out or we decide how ridiculous it is to spend so much money for so little electricity that isn't even reliable.
[01:13:01.155 --> 01:13:05.797]  The climate right now is no warmer than it's been many times throughout history.
[01:13:05.937 --> 01:13:11.639]  Our baseline is now the lowest the carbon dioxide has been in 600 million years.
[01:13:12.099 --> 01:13:15.201]  That won't stop King Charles from demanding that U.S.
[01:13:15.261 --> 01:13:24.224]  taxpayers pump trillions of dollars into their organization in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
[01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:27.626]  Our grandchildren won't be asking what we said.
[01:13:28.743 --> 01:13:32.965]  They will be living with the consequences of what we did or didn't do.
[01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:41.370]  So if we act together to safeguard our precious planet, the welfare of all our people will surely follow.
[01:13:43.131 --> 01:13:44.912]  The Earth does not belong to us.
[01:13:45.993 --> 01:13:47.754]  We belong to the Earth.
[01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:52.876]  They're Kim trailing with aluminum dioxide all over the world, killing the seeds, the plants, the trees, the insects dying.
[01:13:53.437 --> 01:13:57.459]  They've got the Hadrian Collider in their own sinus and making them blow the Earth up, the tests they're doing.
[01:13:58.226 --> 01:14:03.809]  They're the ones releasing GMO, they're the ones with the 5G, they're the ones saying cut down trees, carbon's bad.
[01:14:04.049 --> 01:14:08.671]  So everything he says is a giant lie, except we own the earth, you don't.
[01:14:08.872 --> 01:14:09.452]  It's ours.
[01:14:09.652 --> 01:14:10.893]  We're the guardians of the earth.
[01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:13.254]  He represents the earth while he's killing it.
[01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:23.019]  While the annual president of COP28, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, raised questions no one wanted to address.
[01:14:23.399 --> 01:14:28.804]  Reports in The Guardian of your comments that there is no science behind calls to cut fossil fuels.
[01:14:29.424 --> 01:14:30.545]  Do you maintain this?
[01:14:30.885 --> 01:14:36.610]  Contribute to a loss of public confidence in this cop outside of the negotiating bubble here on site.
[01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:41.034]  What I'm saying today, you have access to all of my public engagements.
[01:14:41.494 --> 01:14:41.835]  It's there.
[01:14:42.987 --> 01:14:43.987]  I'm not gonna say anything new.
[01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:51.509]  While John Kerry wants food production halted and millions to starve in order to worship his delusions.
[01:14:51.930 --> 01:15:02.633]  Emissions from the food system alone are projected to cause another half a degree of warming by mid-century on the current course that we are today.
[01:15:03.373 --> 01:15:10.175]  And you just can't continue to both warm the planet while also expecting to feed it.
[01:15:11.311 --> 01:15:11.832]  Doesn't work.
[01:15:12.512 --> 01:15:27.147]  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia spearheads a 500 billion dollar project to cram 260,000 people per square kilometer into a 110 mile long dense urban nightmare.
[01:15:27.728 --> 01:15:30.290]  Imagine Neom as a prototype for a better future.
[01:15:30.771 --> 01:15:31.692]  A future for all.
[01:15:31.712 --> 01:15:34.575]  One being built to last.
[01:15:36.818 --> 01:15:37.338]  Sound good?
[01:15:37.738 --> 01:15:43.741]  Adding to their misguided solutions is the use of carbon dioxide removal machines.
[01:15:44.361 --> 01:15:47.822]  One of our plants does the work of 40 million trees.
[01:15:48.842 --> 01:15:51.843]  So if we're going to plant trees instead of doing our plants, we'd better get on with it.
[01:15:52.184 --> 01:15:53.164]  We'd better plant lots of them.
[01:15:53.911 --> 01:15:59.252]  A scaled-up plant could do the work of 40 million trees, but only if the carbon were sequestered underground.
[01:15:59.372 --> 01:16:22.598]  However, the potential leaks from storing carbon in underground reservoirs due to well failures, earthquakes, and big money ignoring potential regulations, the leaking CO2 underground in high concentration, combined with the coupled processing of poisonous hydrogen sulfide, could be massively catastrophic to life on Earth.
[01:16:23.118 --> 01:16:27.722]  A perfect target for potential terror attacks or false flag events.
[01:16:28.122 --> 01:16:38.269]  Putting the extinction of targeted populations in the hands of New World Order psychopathic cults with a weapon of genocide lurking beneath our feet.
[01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:41.812]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:16:41.932 --> 01:16:45.054]  Yeah, just like the Hindenburg, it's explosive and concentrated.
[01:16:45.074 --> 01:16:48.437]  By the way, it's what plants breathe is carbon dioxide.
[01:16:50.376 --> 01:16:52.318]  Lula rebuilds planetary suicide machines.
[01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:54.020]  Very important report.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.943]  But let's talk about the real suicide machines.
[01:16:56.983 --> 01:16:58.925]  I mean, that's a real one too, but this is out in the open.
[01:17:00.387 --> 01:17:02.749]  Dan Dix, Press for Truth, Infowars.com.
[01:17:02.869 --> 01:17:03.911]  New vaccine mandates.
[01:17:03.951 --> 01:17:06.553]  Brazil is forcing vaccine on babies.
[01:17:06.634 --> 01:17:07.655]  Lula's a communist.
[01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:26.066]  Bolsonaro banned it, and now they're giving them the experimental shot that sterilizes, destroys the immune system, causes cardiovascular problems, Brazil's mandatory vaccine for children, a socialist criminal president Lula, the Silva demands people inject their kids or lose welfare, or have their children taken.
[01:17:26.686 --> 01:17:29.568]  That's all being run by the IMF and the World Bank.
[01:17:29.868 --> 01:17:30.528]  Here's another one.
[01:17:30.568 --> 01:17:35.490]  DNA contamination and COVID jabs could explain rising cancers, clots, and autoimmune disease.
[01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:38.072]  Another big study on that.
[01:17:38.905 --> 01:17:41.507]  The media is hyping carbon passports to restrict travel.
[01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:48.473]  Big article from Zero Hedge linking to all the... CNN and everybody else promoting carbon passports, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:49.153 --> 01:17:52.556]  Absolute tyranny in your face.
[01:17:53.216 --> 01:17:54.497]  But we're here challenging it.
[01:17:54.798 --> 01:17:55.678]  We're here fighting it.
[01:17:55.718 --> 01:18:00.442]  But I gotta tell you, we're having huge success reaching... I don't want to exaggerate.
[01:18:00.462 --> 01:18:06.507]  The last five, six days we've reached about... Let's not exaggerate.
[01:18:08.232 --> 01:18:11.194]  300?
[01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.194]  No, that's too low.
[01:18:11.214 --> 01:18:14.156]  400 million people?
[01:18:14.776 --> 01:18:15.316]  400 million!
[01:18:15.336 --> 01:18:19.199]  That's a very low estimate.
[01:18:19.219 --> 01:18:29.505]  400 million people that this creature, Alex Jones, has reached thanks to your support, your promotion.
[01:18:29.545 --> 01:18:34.500]   So, your backing of us I can say it's paid off.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.121]  And you get all the credit, by the way.
[01:18:36.821 --> 01:18:38.122]  I mean, I'm built for war.
[01:18:39.043 --> 01:18:39.883]  I'm built to take it.
[01:18:39.983 --> 01:18:40.964]  That's just how God made me.
[01:18:41.004 --> 01:18:44.186]  I'm not perfect, but God knows I actually enjoy all these attacks.
[01:18:44.226 --> 01:18:47.768]  So as long as I'm winning, I feel really good.
[01:18:47.908 --> 01:18:50.570]  When I'm losing, I'm even more pissed off if I even harder.
[01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:53.892]  That's why God always likes to keep me right where I'm losing to get full potential.
[01:18:53.912 --> 01:18:56.974]  In fact, God just finally told me, I said, why am I always kept to the edge of destruction?
[01:18:57.635 --> 01:19:01.877]  And finally, I'm sitting there on the couch outside watching my daughter swim in the pool.
[01:19:03.527 --> 01:19:06.388]  I said a couple days ago, it feels like a million years ago, Saturday, yesterday morning.
[01:19:07.348 --> 01:19:09.708]  The pool's heated and she's out there swimming around even though it's cold.
[01:19:10.569 --> 01:19:12.149]  And I literally was like hit again.
[01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:15.270]  And God said, I've told you this, you're not listening.
[01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:19.331]  You're hungrier when you're getting your ass kicked, son.
[01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:22.091]  If you were winning all the time and you fought harder, I'd do that.
[01:19:22.431 --> 01:19:24.452]  You fight harder when you're getting your ass kicked.
[01:19:25.222 --> 01:19:27.588]  Literally, I was like, okay, I understand now.
[01:19:27.989 --> 01:19:32.940]  And now once I was told that, people, the Satanists laugh at that, but they follow Satan's orders, I follow God's orders.
[01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:33.962]  It's obvious.
[01:19:36.451 --> 01:19:38.152]  That's why I'm always kept on the edge of destruction.
[01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.474]  That's why I'm always kept going into the fire.
[01:19:40.494 --> 01:19:44.397]  Because humanity's going into the fire, and God wants me right where everybody's at.
[01:19:45.117 --> 01:19:46.198]  So I get it, God.
[01:19:46.258 --> 01:19:46.919]  You're the master.
[01:19:46.979 --> 01:19:48.000]  You got it all figured out.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.060]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:49.521]  Stay with us.
[01:19:50.101 --> 01:19:54.444]  Final segment before Chase Geyser takes over 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:19:54.504 --> 01:19:58.808]  Central on the InfoWars Network with Sunday Live.
[01:19:59.388 --> 01:20:04.612]  Whatever you do, don't share the links from Bandai Video and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:20:07.472 --> 01:20:10.393]  I want to read this quote, because as evil as V.I.
[01:20:10.453 --> 01:20:17.956]  Lenin was, and as evil as Joseph Stalin was, they said a lot of things that were cold-blooded and true.
[01:20:18.796 --> 01:20:21.477]  Stalin famously said, when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.778]  When 10,000 dies, it's statistics.
[01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:25.019]  Well, V.I.
[01:20:25.059 --> 01:20:31.401]  Lenin said, there are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen.
[01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:36.203]  That is true.
[01:20:38.311 --> 01:20:43.794]  There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen.
[01:20:46.115 --> 01:20:50.237]  And that's where we are right now.
[01:20:51.117 --> 01:20:55.440]  We are at the crossroads in the future of humanity.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:12.774]   And it's not like I just sit up here and say this with all the thousands of political stripes and all the weird subgroups and 10,000 Christian denominations and a hundred Muslim denominations and A hundred Hindu deals and, you know, all of it.
[01:21:13.394 --> 01:21:17.476]  We're here covering what the mega banks, what the globalists own documents say.
[01:21:17.496 --> 01:21:23.518]  We're like reading what they say and watching them get it implemented decades later and saying, man, these people are out to get us.
[01:21:25.478 --> 01:21:26.679]  And it's so frustrating.
[01:21:26.699 --> 01:21:29.800]  Like, why is everybody else singing to sheets of music that aren't real?
[01:21:31.365 --> 01:21:41.778]  I mean, I tell you, as Zbigniew Brzezinski said before he died to the Council on Foreign Relations, it's easier to kill a million people than convince a million people, so we've got to start learning how to kill the general public.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:49.528]  I mean, you better go find that clip, take you 30 seconds to do it, and then you decide what you're going to do about that.
[01:21:50.154 --> 01:21:50.914]  I'm a man, though.
[01:21:50.934 --> 01:21:53.536]  I'm not the biggest, baddest guy around, but you know what?
[01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:58.599]  Big ol' powerful groups are planning to kill me and my family, and that means all of you at the same time.
[01:21:58.799 --> 01:22:00.039]  People say, oh, why do you have so much empathy?
[01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:01.700]  People say, I care about my family.
[01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:04.722]  I was on the air with Vivek Ramaswamy today and Elon Musk.
[01:22:05.562 --> 01:22:07.143]  It was my show on there.
[01:22:08.044 --> 01:22:09.344]  I could ask all the questions I wanted to.
[01:22:09.364 --> 01:22:09.925]  It was crazy.
[01:22:11.506 --> 01:22:13.627]  And I said, let's not talk about me and all the diversions.
[01:22:14.895 --> 01:22:17.657]  Let's talk about the attack of physics, like, well, first things, my family.
[01:22:17.737 --> 01:22:24.222]  Well, yeah, but if you're not in a free country or things are dangerous and other families aren't safe, you're not safe.
[01:22:24.262 --> 01:22:25.363]  And I know he knows that.
[01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:28.225]  But there is no separation, folks.
[01:22:29.546 --> 01:22:32.529]  There isn't like, my family's doing OK, so screw yours.
[01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:35.945]  Now if your family's lazy and corrupt and evil, that's their problem.
[01:22:35.965 --> 01:22:37.266]  We've got to defend ourselves from you.
[01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:41.249]  But the idea that we get ahead and you don't is a lie.
[01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:47.294]  If you really think about civilization, the civilizations that do well is where we try to empower everybody.
[01:22:47.334 --> 01:22:49.036]  Now some of us are going to do better in that.
[01:22:49.838 --> 01:22:52.360]  Because we're harder working, whatever, better circumstances.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:59.125]  But at the end of the day, a real society that empowers or tries to empower everybody is a civilization I want.
[01:22:59.205 --> 01:23:05.949]  The left has their counterfeit of that, where they want to lower everybody to make us equally slaves.
[01:23:06.009 --> 01:23:08.531]  No, we have competition with incredible heights.
[01:23:09.232 --> 01:23:12.954]  The lows are way above the lows of a tyranny or a collectivist system.
[01:23:13.194 --> 01:23:15.416]  You know, the lows of a collectivist system are 100 feet down here.
[01:23:15.896 --> 01:23:18.458]  The lows of a freedom system are just right here.
[01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:19.359]  You're just, you know, boom.
[01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:26.670]  So don't be ashamed of your success, your will, or your hard work.
[01:23:27.571 --> 01:23:32.113]  And don't let anybody intimidate you or tell you you're a piece of garbage because of it.
[01:23:33.653 --> 01:23:34.834]  Celebrate innovation.
[01:23:35.034 --> 01:23:36.655]  Celebrate inventions.
[01:23:36.775 --> 01:23:47.399]  Celebrate Nikola Tesla and Isaac Newton and Alexander Graham Bell.
[01:23:48.579 --> 01:23:49.340]  Celebrate that.
[01:23:50.287 --> 01:23:57.893]  Because that's a celebration of our native intelligence together and all of us sharing an incredible human curiosity and the will of the people.
[01:23:57.913 --> 01:24:01.015]  I've got a couple of clips I want to play here.
[01:24:02.156 --> 01:24:08.501]  The first one is Africans pouring in that have been sent here by the UN and then them running down the streets of Arizona.
[01:24:09.222 --> 01:24:10.603]  Let's play it all back to back.
[01:24:11.183 --> 01:24:12.324]  Then I've got a clip of Biden.
[01:24:12.564 --> 01:24:16.628]  This is not an edited clip because I saw this last night and I thought this has got to be fake.
[01:24:17.248 --> 01:24:18.649]  So I went and found the full speech.
[01:24:18.729 --> 01:24:19.330]  This is real.
[01:24:21.104 --> 01:24:27.896]  This is him saying, Jesus knew the importance of airports, and then he says even more whacked out stuff.
[01:24:27.916 --> 01:24:28.417]  Here's the clips.
[01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.455]  Where are you guys from?
[01:24:33.475 --> 01:24:33.775]  Africa.
[01:24:33.815 --> 01:24:34.335]  Africa, where?
[01:24:34.355 --> 01:24:34.776]  What country?
[01:24:34.615 --> 01:24:40.335]  Where are you guys from?
[01:24:40.335 --> 01:24:41.335]  Africa.
[01:24:41.335 --> 01:24:42.335]  Africa, where?
[01:24:42.335 --> 01:24:43.336]  What country?
[01:24:43.336 --> 01:24:44.336]  Guinea.
[01:24:44.336 --> 01:24:45.336]  Guinea, Guinea.
[01:24:45.336 --> 01:24:46.336]  Guinea, Guinea, Gwanaki.
[01:24:46.336 --> 01:24:47.336]  And then there's shots of the highway.
[01:24:47.336 --> 01:25:10.694]   So Arizona just illegal aliens, just no jobs, no future, no plan, no money.
[01:25:10.664 --> 01:25:12.606]  Well, they're going to break into your house, folks.
[01:25:14.127 --> 01:25:15.148]  It's happened all over Europe.
[01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:19.373]  And they just sit back and watch the whole thing happen.
[01:25:19.933 --> 01:25:22.536]  And then here's Joe Biden not knowing what planet he's on.
[01:25:24.434 --> 01:25:32.056]  By the way, the same stable genius who said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn't have enough airports!
[01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:35.297]  Whoa!
[01:25:37.598 --> 01:25:37.878]  What?
[01:25:38.658 --> 01:25:39.759]  What are you talking about, man?
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:49.022]  Jesus the genius, in the Revolutionary War, said the biggest problem we face is not having enough airplanes.
[01:25:49.402 --> 01:25:49.942]  Play that again.
[01:25:52.168 --> 01:25:59.756]  By the way, the same stable genius that said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn't have enough airports.
[01:26:02.399 --> 01:26:03.040]  Whoa.
[01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:05.202]  I'm sorry, I said airplanes.
[01:26:05.222 --> 01:26:05.382]  What?
[01:26:05.402 --> 01:26:05.763]  Airports.
[01:26:06.363 --> 01:26:07.184]  What are you talking about?
[01:26:07.244 --> 01:26:09.487]  So the stable genius Jesus didn't...
[01:26:10.802 --> 01:26:13.103]  Said our biggest problem in the Revolutionary War was not enough airports.
[01:26:13.743 --> 01:26:15.364]  I mean, what brain?
[01:26:15.944 --> 01:26:21.426]  The same stable genius, Jesus, said our biggest problem in the Revolutionary War wasn't enough airports.
[01:26:21.806 --> 01:26:24.727]  I mean, that sounds like Dr. Seuss on 15 hits of acid.
[01:26:28.028 --> 01:26:32.729]  And that's the guy that bragged last week to a union, I got the nuclear launch codes!
[01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:40.052]  And now he's like, you don't give me another 106 billion, I'm gonna start war with the Russians right now!
[01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.851]  Your sons and daughters are gonna die!
[01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.192]  People go, well that's just crazy Biden.
[01:26:46.652 --> 01:26:48.873]  And then the Secretary of Defense goes and tells Congress that.
[01:26:49.393 --> 01:26:54.035]  And then Blinken goes on the National News, I played it the first hour, and says it again.
[01:26:55.616 --> 01:26:57.376]  These people are cuckoo.
[01:26:59.277 --> 01:27:00.878]  Completely out of their mind.
[01:27:01.198 --> 01:27:06.060]  He probably just took five Adderalls to even get out there and be able to talk.
[01:27:07.921 --> 01:27:11.890]   If I drink a cup of coffee too late today, I feel like I'm going to pass out.
[01:27:12.391 --> 01:27:14.913]  I'm 50 years old, folks.
[01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:17.055]  I've talked to the Secret Service.
[01:27:17.676 --> 01:27:19.657]  I told Tucker Carlson, it doesn't be yes.
[01:27:19.677 --> 01:27:21.279]  Remember, he said, oh, the NSA spying on me?
[01:27:21.299 --> 01:27:24.101]  A month later, yes, the NSA was spying on Tucker Carlson.
[01:27:24.802 --> 01:27:25.703]  He doesn't make stuff up.
[01:27:26.724 --> 01:27:28.065]  He said, yeah, I heard what you heard.
[01:27:28.365 --> 01:27:29.867]  I've talked to the Secret Service.
[01:27:29.907 --> 01:27:31.008]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:27:32.728 --> 01:27:33.849]  They're like, we're really scared.
[01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:35.390]  They're injecting him with weird stuff.
[01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:35.990]  We think it's speed.
[01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:36.971]  He gets all wild after.
[01:27:37.271 --> 01:27:37.992]  They give him other pills.
[01:27:38.012 --> 01:27:38.612]  He goes to sleep.
[01:27:38.972 --> 01:27:40.554]  I said, yeah, that, I mean, I speculated.
[01:27:40.574 --> 01:27:41.094]  That's meth.
[01:27:41.134 --> 01:27:41.754]  That's downers.
[01:27:41.774 --> 01:27:45.697]  And they said, yeah, he wanders around naked and craps everywhere.
[01:27:45.717 --> 01:27:47.018]  He gets mad.
[01:27:47.058 --> 01:27:48.419]  He just starts crapping on everybody.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.621]  I told you that three years, two years ago.
[01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:51.862]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:27:52.522 --> 01:27:56.605]  I told you Hillary falls down all the time and puts in a black ambulance.
[01:27:56.985 --> 01:27:58.426]  A month later, he got caught on video.
[01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.548]  That was directly from the Secret Service.
[01:28:02.022 --> 01:28:04.264]  They said, can you put somebody on our ambulance?
[01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:06.565]  I said, I've only got three or four reporters, I'll try.
[01:28:08.227 --> 01:28:11.589]  One of our reporters caught her falling down, being taken into the deal.
[01:28:11.909 --> 01:28:13.771]  It all got shut down in like, Ohio.
[01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:15.512]  Or it was Iowa.
[01:28:16.253 --> 01:28:20.476]  And then another independent reporter, not us, caught her falling down on 9-11 in New York.
[01:28:21.036 --> 01:28:22.257]  So yeah, are my sources right?
[01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:26.860]  They said she's in a black ambulance, she has convulsions every couple hours, can you just follow her?
[01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:28.482]  And it was true!
[01:28:29.801 --> 01:28:33.305]  So, the Feds aren't even our enemy, folks, the mid-level, low-level.
[01:28:33.325 --> 01:28:34.526]  They're telling us stuff that's true.
[01:28:37.530 --> 01:28:45.819]  Our enemy is the people running things, but we've seen the whistleblowers in Congress about Hunter and the whores and the Chinese agents and everything.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.521]  So, we don't want a civil war.
[01:28:47.561 --> 01:28:48.682]  The government's not even our issue.
[01:28:48.742 --> 01:28:50.224]  It's who runs the government.
[01:28:51.277 --> 01:28:53.038]  Like when a hijacker takes over a jet.
[01:28:53.278 --> 01:28:55.899]  It's not the American Airlines if somebody hijacks it.
[01:28:55.939 --> 01:28:56.879]  It's the damn hijacker.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.040]  We're going to break.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.260]  Chase Geyser's taking over.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.641]  The Great Awakening.

[01:30:19.145 --> 01:30:20.145]  Please join us.
[01:30:20.145 --> 01:30:30.145]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:30:30.145 --> 01:30:37.065]   People on the street and also folks that call on the show constantly give me credit and say, you're so great.
[01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:37.805]  Oh, you're so wonderful.
[01:30:38.145 --> 01:30:39.026]  No, you're great.
[01:30:39.366 --> 01:30:42.869]  You're wonderful for keeping us on the air and spread the word.
[01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:47.493]  Our real power is you, the audience of activists, the men and women in the arena.
[01:30:47.754 --> 01:30:48.614]  And I thank you all.
[01:30:48.875 --> 01:30:50.236]  And I salute you all for your support.
[01:30:50.396 --> 01:30:57.304]  Look at the huge whistleblowers now going public on the COVID poison shots and on human sex slavery and trafficking.
[01:30:57.364 --> 01:30:59.206]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[01:30:59.286 --> 01:31:03.971]  And that's because of good men and women in government in the private sector blowing the whistle.
[01:31:04.072 --> 01:31:08.934]   And the only way the information gets Well, we are the good men and women and we are not doing nothing.
[01:31:08.974 --> 01:31:10.034]  We are taking action.
[01:31:10.054 --> 01:31:11.055]  So, Christmas 2023 is already here.
[01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:14.354]   the articles, taking the videos, it really is changing the world.
[01:31:14.354 --> 01:31:18.954]   Thomas Jefferson said the only way that tyrants can flourish and prevail over humanity is
[01:31:18.954 --> 01:31:20.394]  if good men and women do nothing.
[01:31:20.394 --> 01:31:23.554]   Well, we are the good men and women and we are not doing nothing.
[01:31:23.554 --> 01:31:25.414]  We are taking action.
[01:31:25.414 --> 01:31:29.515]  So Christmas 2023 is already here.
[01:31:29.515 --> 01:31:33.434]   Hard to believe we're just a few weeks away from Christmas and that means every year we
[01:31:33.434 --> 01:31:35.335]  have the biggest sales of the year.
[01:31:35.335 --> 01:31:39.753]   But this is the biggest sale hands down ever because so many of the products that have
[01:31:39.753 --> 01:31:46.154]   been sold out with supply chain breakdowns and other issues are finally in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:46.165 --> 01:31:57.889]  So we have store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, an additional 10% off when you sign up for auto ship on your next order, cancel anytime, and things like X2 and Turbo Force.
[01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:59.370]  Sold out for many months.
[01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:00.371]  X2 for over a year.
[01:32:00.551 --> 01:32:03.253]  Finally back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:05.875]  Then we have Vazzo Beats that has nitrous oxide.
[01:32:05.935 --> 01:32:10.178]  It produces that in your blood that cleans out your blood and does so much just like Nitric Boost does.
[01:32:10.219 --> 01:32:12.020]  Another great product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.662]  They just both do it from two different herbal directions.
[01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:18.025]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, we are changing the world together.
[01:32:18.545 --> 01:32:19.826]  We're having a massive effect.
[01:32:19.866 --> 01:32:24.182]   But even if we weren't, We would still expose evil.
[01:32:24.222 --> 01:32:29.045]  We would still fight evil because God is watching and that's our job.
[01:32:29.386 --> 01:32:30.907]  We don't do this for other people.
[01:32:31.187 --> 01:32:33.008]  We don't do this to look like the best guys around.
[01:32:33.328 --> 01:32:35.150]  We don't do it to show off like we're heroes.
[01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:40.013]  We do it because the children need to be protected and God is watching.
[01:32:40.413 --> 01:32:46.477]  So for myself and the whole crew, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air the last almost 30 years.
[01:32:46.517 --> 01:32:49.859]  It'll be 30 years in April of 2024, just three months away.
[01:32:50.279 --> 01:32:57.078]   And I want to encourage you now all to go to infowarestore.com and take advantage of
[01:32:57.078 --> 01:32:58.599]  these amazing products.
[01:32:58.599 --> 01:33:03.719]   I mean up to 60% off on so many of them like Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[01:33:03.719 --> 01:33:04.719]  People ask me which one's better.
[01:33:04.719 --> 01:33:06.958]   There are two different formulas, different people different.
[01:33:06.958 --> 01:33:08.679]  One's fast acting, only lasts a few hours.
[01:33:08.679 --> 01:33:10.958]  The other's not fast acting, lasts four or five hours.
[01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:12.279]  They're different formulas folks.
[01:33:12.279 --> 01:33:14.279]  So different people like different ones.
[01:33:14.279 --> 01:33:15.719]  Brain Force Plus is great.
