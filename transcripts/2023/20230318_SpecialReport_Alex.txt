[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.500]  [Outro]
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.881]  Alex Jones here with a Saturday emergency news alert.
[00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:29.302]  The greatest constitutional crisis in US history is now unfolding before our eyes.
[00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:41.884]  President Trump yesterday put out a short press release on his true social site saying that he believes he'll be arrested as early as next Tuesday in only about two and a half days.
[00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:44.465]  I made phone calls to talk to people very close to Trump.
[00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:59.334]  And indeed have confirmed that they've been contacted by the Manhattan DA, a Soros-funded, open, New World Order globalist, and that they are intending as early as Tuesday to issue the indictment and the arrest warrant for President Trump.
[00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:10.476]  He will then travel as early as Tuesday, probably Wednesday or Thursday, to Manhattan with the Secret Service to be placed in handcuffs and maybe even put in jail.
[00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:18.257]  This has never happened in the 240 plus year history of the United States and for a very important reason.
[00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:30.745]  If one of tens of thousands of prosecutors across the United States, remember most of them are now in George Soros' back pocket, want to indict somebody, they can do it.
[00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:32.949]   They can indict A ham sandwich.
[00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.693]  Now what's incredible here is that if you look at the statute of limitations federally, it's five years.
[00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:45.239]  Same thing with the state of New York for what they're calling campaign finance fraud because he reportedly paid hush money over $100,000 to Stormy Daniels.
[00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:51.884]  But that happened many, many years ago and it's been over five years since these investigations even started.
[00:01:52.725 --> 00:02:08.222]   Now, it's also very interesting to note, this is even being admitted to on Fox and CNN, that In the city of Manhattan and in the state of New York, they are not even charging people with felonies when it's felony crimes like armed robbery.
[00:02:08.743 --> 00:02:15.031]  But they've escalated campaign finance fraud of this type, that's a misdemeanor in New York, up to a felony.
[00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:17.934]  So they're breaking their own rules to do it.
[00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:20.630]  As we've seen with this weaponized judiciary.
[00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.914]  Now John Roberts at Fox News has an excellent quick two-minute report where he lays all this out.
[00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:30.678]  I'm going to play that clip and then come back and give you the rest of the story and the inside intel we've got.
[00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:38.545]  Now we are learning that the Manhattan DA's office has asked for a meeting with law enforcement ahead of a potential Trump indictment.
[00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.586]  This is coming to Fox News from a source in the courts.
[00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:53.148]  The meeting, which was requested yesterday and has not been set yet, is to discuss logistics for some time next week, which would mean that they are anticipating an indictment next week.
[00:02:53.548 --> 00:03:00.230]  The same source who's familiar with the planning said they will go over security preparations in and around the courthouse in lower Manhattan.
[00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.009]   The Secret Service will take the lead in what they will allow or will not allow.
[00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:11.490]   The source cautioned, mentioning for instance that the decision to handcuff the president,
[00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.290]  a former president, or not.
[00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.490]   They will set the tone and will escort him into the courtroom.
[00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.049]   There will be coordination between all of us, the source said, but we will defer to
[00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:28.278]  The battle will be between Secret Service and DA Alvin Bragg.
[00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:32.939]  They will decide how and when he'll get into the building and they are not going to leave him.
[00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:39.821]  The source believes that the former president will still have to be fingerprinted and processed like every other defendant.
[00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:48.324]   So this is a huge development if Alvin Bragg has decided to go ahead with a felony indictment of the former president.
[00:03:48.364 --> 00:03:54.690]  This was a charge that the federal officials refused to prosecute on or even really pursue.
[00:03:55.371 --> 00:04:06.221]  This was a misdemeanor in New York that Alvin Bragg has decided to elevate to a felony while at the same time downgrading other felonies to misdemeanors.
[00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:10.705]  So we'll be watching this to see how it all unfolds and get more information as it comes in.
[00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:23.030]  Now let's elaborate on why this is the biggest constitutional crisis in our history and why no president has ever been indicted, either previous president or current president, by a state prosecution group.
[00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:33.234]  Because, again, any rogue group can then thwart the will of the people and take control of the leader of the executive branch of our government.
[00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:41.318]   This is a coup, a legal coup, part of the total weaponization of the judicial
[00:04:41.318 --> 00:04:46.617]   system, the judiciary, and the courts, something the left admits they're doing to populist
[00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:49.158]  Christians and conservatives everywhere.
[00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:51.918]  And they're only gearing up now to do it more.
[00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:56.438]   So they're able to do this with the former president, who's now running for office again,
[00:04:56.438 --> 00:05:00.877]   of the United States of America, think what's coming in the future.
[00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:07.671]  Now in Trump's statement, he said that America's in crisis and that he wants everybody to protest and take the country back.
[00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:08.912]  I'll be very clear.
[00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:20.581]  People should protest peacefully, but do not be provocateur into violence and know that there will be people at these events in places like New York and DC that will behave just like Ray Epps did at the Capitol.
[00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:25.305]  They attempted to set myself up and President Trump and countless others on January 6th, 2021.
[00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:25.925]  Let's not.
[00:05:28.587 --> 00:05:29.587]  Let this happen again.
[00:05:29.668 --> 00:05:41.953]  But at the same time, let's not let the massive political prosecution of close to 1,000 innocent people, and now the Justice Department says they want to charge another 1,000, be a chilling effect to keep us from exercising our cherished First Amendment.
[00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:50.737]  But at the same time, let's be as peaceful as possible and never offensively carry out any violence, but certainly we have a right and duty to defend ourselves.
[00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:52.793]  We're winning politically.
[00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:53.894]  We're winning culturally.
[00:05:54.494 --> 00:06:00.316]  And the only reason the deep state's doing this out of blind panic is to try to elicit some type of violent response.
[00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:01.157]  We don't want that to happen.
[00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:09.300]  Every major political analyst out there, including myself, will tell you this indictment of Trump will make him the number one candidate.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.260]  He's already the number one candidate.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.361]  This will add 10, 15 points to him.
[00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.984]  In the Republican primary polls, this will absolutely shut out DeSantis.
[00:06:16.004 --> 00:06:25.551]  So you have to ask yourself, if this is assured, like Elon Musk said, to win Trump the presidency in 2024 in a landslide, why on earth will the system be doing it?
[00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:27.172]  Because they're scared.
[00:06:27.733 --> 00:06:41.684]  It's the same reason the UN just indicted Vladimir Putin for evacuating children from a war zone, something that happens in every major war, including in England during World War II, including in Russia during World War II as well.
[00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:51.700]  So within a matter of days, in fact it was Friday, that both Trump got the news he'd be indicted and that Vladimir Putin was indicted.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:07:03.945]   So whether you love Trump or hate Trump, whether you like Putin or hate Putin, You have to understand, this is part of the same globalist system that is moving against leaders they believe are not in line with their operations.
[00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:06.486]  So again, I've talked to people very, very close to Trump.
[00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.086]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:18.349]  They confirmed the Secret Service is in talks with a Manhattan DA, a leftist operative, dyed in the wool, New World Order globalist, to have Trump turn himself in.
[00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.109]  This has never happened before.
[00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:36.394]   This is a state court saying it trumps the power, pun intended, Over the federal executive and over a man we all know really won the presidency but regardless is a former president who is the front runner in the Republican Party to win the nomination for 2024.
[00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:39.436]  That is direct absolute election meddling.
[00:07:39.856 --> 00:07:45.119]  And let's not forget it's now been confirmed that the whole Russiagate thing was a hoax, a giant lie.
[00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:47.980]  The dossiers, all of it, were totally made up.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:56.223]  And they used that pretext to not just censor Trump or Alex Jones, but millions of Americans and others in the last six years with big tech.
[00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:56.803]  The U.S.
[00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:10.407]  intelligence agencies with think tanks and with PR firms and with dinosaur media, legacy media, were working to suppress the American people on open borders, on lockdowns, on election fraud, on forced injections, on the Afghan withdrawal, on everything.
[00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:15.329]  So this really is a deep state multinational coup against America.
[00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:24.895]  And Trump just last week pledged to destroy the deep state, to fire the globalists once he got into office, and to bring legal and lawful justice on them through the courts.
[00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:28.538]  So that's why they're so dangerous, and that's why they're cornered rats.
[00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:33.762]  And if you think this escalation is bad, the craziest in US history, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:37.144]  The Russia war is spiraling out of control in Ukraine.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.301]  The border is now completely collapsed.
[00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:42.342]  The bank runs I predicted have now begun.
[00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:45.963]  They're rolling out their new global central bank digital currency.
[00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:52.985]  It has never been more important to be informed and engaged and peacefully speaking out and saying no to the system.
[00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:55.626]  The good news is the globalist program is in trouble.
[00:08:56.468 --> 00:09:01.253]  The bad news is they're still in control of the major institutions and they're moving against the American people.
[00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:07.179]  But if we're aware of that and stand up and say no, and don't comply peacefully, there's no way they're going to get away with this.
[00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:09.902]  They've done this through sheer, absolute desperation.
[00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:13.125]   Tomorrow night, on Sunday, Four p.m.
[00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:18.208]  Roger Stone's on to give the inside scoop on this and more and I'll be back Monday morning at 11 a.m.
[00:09:18.248 --> 00:09:20.190]  Central with the normal weekday show.
[00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:26.714]  But please take this report out to everyone you know because this shows our Republic is in a very, very serious crisis.
[00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:27.815]  We woke up to the globalists.
[00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:42.304]   We began to kick out the New World Order occupiers and now they are striking back and coming after a former President of the United States, the first time in history, outside of the statute of limitations and even outside of law, because they're desperate.
[00:09:42.744 --> 00:09:50.210]  I'll see you at InfoWars.com and Band.Video and the new URL we're promoting that the censors aren't blocking yet, MadMaxWorld.TV.
[00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:57.675]  Please join us at MadMaxWorld.TV and share that link because this is an information war and together we can and we must win.
[00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:07.890]  Today, 17th of March, 2023, the International Criminal Court has issued two warrants of arrest in the Ukraine situation.
[00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:24.941]  For Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, and for Maya Lvova-Berova, Commissioner of the Russian Presidents for Children's Rights, for the alleged war crimes of deportation of children from Ukrainian-occupied territories into the Russian Federation.
[00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:34.815]  It is forbidden by international law for occupied powers to transfer civilians from the territory they live in to other territories.
[00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:39.422]  Children enjoy special protection under the Geneva Convention.
[00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.610]   The contents of the warrants are secret in order to protect victims.
[00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:52.610]   The ICC attaches great importance to the protection of victims, especially children.
[00:10:52.610 --> 00:11:01.610]   Nevertheless, the judges of the Chamber dealing with this case decided to make the existence of the warrants public
[00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:07.610]   in the interest of justice and to prevent the commission of future crimes.
[00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:14.610]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon, developed.

[00:11:34.366 --> 00:11:35.447]  It is just dynamite.
[00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:39.831]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
