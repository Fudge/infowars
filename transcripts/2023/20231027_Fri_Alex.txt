[00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:07.608]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:17.214]  They're doing things that can't even, on an academic level, conceivably help the United States or the population that lives here.
[00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:24.078]  Letting in 7 million people from the poorest countries in the world illegally, and then immediately putting them all on public benefits?
[00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:26.700]  I mean, that right there will destroy the country, and they did that on purpose.
[00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:29.383]  So these are really, really dark people.
[00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:30.463]  The darkest.
[00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:36.145]  Inaction is unacceptable and we must come together and address the broken border.
[00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:36.885]  We have to do it.
[00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.046]  It's far worse than anyone wants to realize.
[00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:44.228]  She came home and saw this round object the dogs were playing with in the yard.
[00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:46.168]  She found that it was a human skull.
[00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:48.289]  It still has brain matter in it.
[00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.350]  It's 96 countries.
[00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:56.099]  Not only is the border overwhelmed, we are witnessing a slow-motion treasonous act of the highest order.
[00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:03.338]   concern. They're bringing in, they brought in 7,300 people from special
[00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:08.498]   interest countries where there's terrorist organizations operating by
[00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:13.138]   invitation. Not only is the border overwhelmed, we are witnessing a
[00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:16.668]  slow-motion treasonous act of the highest order.
[00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:22.688]   Congressman, what we do at CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,
[00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:28.698]   is identify the tactics that adverse nation-states use to
[00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:32.179]   weaponize disinformation.
[00:01:30.893 --> 00:01:31.894]  Who determines what's false?
[00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:33.114]  Do you understand the problem here?
[00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:41.959]  The reason the framers of our Constitution did not create an exception for quote-unquote false information from the First Amendment is because they didn't trust the government to determine what it is.
[00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.621]  Meanwhile, the establishment revels in their evil madness.
[00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:54.506]  As the Daily Caller reported, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas honored Avita Musavian, chief of the U.S.
[00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:59.208]  Citizenship and Immigration Services Office of Policy and Strategy.
[00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:04.567]   Moosavian had tweeted in 2018 before she began her tenure with the Biden administration the
[00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:11.847]   hashtag #abolishice saying the agency was misleading the public and making our workplaces
[00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:13.206]  less safe.
[00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:18.407]   The tide has turned as Democrats have been hit with the cold realization of the consequences
[00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:24.007]   they will face personally due to their compliance with the United Nations clouded and pivened
[00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.806]  deluge of human suffering and inevitable terrorism.
[00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:31.447]   An eighth grader killed on a cleaning shift at a poultry plant in Mississippi.
[00:02:31.457 --> 00:02:36.682]  A 14-year-old hospitalized in Alabama after being overworked at a chicken operation.
[00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:40.826]  Another child lost his hand in a meat grinder in a Michigan operation.
[00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:46.631]  A 14-year-old maimed while working an overnight shift in our country.
[00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:53.497]  Since President Biden's been president, how many non-American citizens have come into our country illegally?
[00:02:54.518 --> 00:02:56.581]  Or on the basis of a claim of asylum?
[00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:57.762]  Thank you, Senator.
[00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:02.368]  HSI as an investigative agency is... Do you know the number?
[00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:03.489]  No, Senator.
[00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.934]  You're a senior member of Homeland Security, are you not?
[00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:09.396]  That's correct.
[00:03:09.816 --> 00:03:11.038]  Does anybody know the number?
[00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.422]  None of you know the number.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.543]  Basically, we've got a broken system.
[00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:20.805]  You don't know how to fix it.
[00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:23.827]  Money's not going to solve this problem, Ms.
[00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:24.308]  Nanda.
[00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.491]  You don't know the numbers.
[00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:31.074]  You don't know the law to enforce the law.
[00:03:32.175 --> 00:03:38.821]  So what comes across is that we've got a homeland security team here that doesn't believe in securing the homeland.
[00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:50.936]  Because you don't care enough to go deep enough into the issue to be able to define the problem and be able to fix it.
[00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:54.159]  Your goal is not to secure the country and the border.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.545]  Your goal is to just let everybody come on in and to hell with this trying to find 85,000 kids.
[00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:08.270]  Do you really think that you're helping these children by releasing them to labor traffickers and, yes, sex traffickers?
[00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:23.596]  85,000 children whom you have no contact with and your answer is, we gave them a presentation before we turned them over to these people who are exploiting them on a scale not seen in this country for a hundred years, a century.
[00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.396]  What's the number?
[00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.017]  What's the number?
[00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.157]  How many of you are you in?
[00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:27.738]  You said child welfare is your top concern.
[00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:28.238]  What's the number?
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.082]  I don't have the specific number.
[00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:32.183]  How can you not know?
[00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:34.865]  Why would you come to this hearing and not know?
[00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:47.838]  America must now focus with total unyielding concentration on deporting millions of illegal immigrants, even as our president foments more wars to reinforce the Great Distraction.
[00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:51.662]  The United States defense agreement with the Philippines is ironclad.
[00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:59.810]  Any attack on the Filipino aircraft vessels or armed forces will invoke our mutual defense treaty with the Philippines.
[00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.074]  America First isn't some throwaway political slogan.
[00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:07.157]  It is the difference between life and death.
[00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:08.719]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:23.182]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:27.243]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:33.184]  You've heard people say, you'll have to pry my guns from my cold dead hands.
[00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:34.145]  Okay.
[00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:39.486]  We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:43.289]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles.
[00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.414]  If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.
[00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:52.238]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:05:52.298 --> 00:05:59.105]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:05:59.245 --> 00:05:59.506]  Enough.
[00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:03.948]  We say no more!
[00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.571]  I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban that became law.
[00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:16.116]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line, he says, I have an AR-15 and I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[00:06:16.356 --> 00:06:16.816]  Hell yes!
[00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:19.536]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:24.135]   We're not gonna allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:27.456]  Do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?
[00:06:27.481 --> 00:06:33.324]  I said, well, look, I mean, obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[00:06:33.344 --> 00:06:35.664]  I'm incredibly saddened.
[00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:42.485]  And it is very hard to think about this.
[00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.685]   I'm tired of hearing people, all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers.
[00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:50.225]  In my faith, people say faith without works is dead.
[00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:51.826]  So we will find a way.
[00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:57.028]  But the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate.
[00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:00.609]  It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda.
[00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:05.811]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period.
[00:07:06.012 --> 00:07:08.453]  And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.434]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.
[00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:18.052]  Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference.
[00:07:18.232 --> 00:07:19.633]  We can ban the weapons of war.
[00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:23.136]  It's about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities.
[00:07:23.517 --> 00:07:27.760]  Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.563]  They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.
[00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:36.728]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:07:39.045 --> 00:07:42.167]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period.
[00:07:42.507 --> 00:07:43.908]  They cannot be sold anymore.
[00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:48.531]  Like, if you're gonna take people's guns away, wait till you get elected, then take the guns away.
[00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.452]  Don't tell them ahead of time.
[00:07:50.492 --> 00:07:55.515]  Which, by the way, that's what people like me think you're gonna do.
[00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:02.640]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.041]  You don't want my thanks.
[00:08:04.642 --> 00:08:10.607]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:11.347]  And you know what?
[00:08:11.788 --> 00:08:14.470]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:29.177]   And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:37.445]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:46.554]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[00:08:47.597 --> 00:08:48.537]  You have made history.
[00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:50.418]  We have made history together.
[00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:57.897]   Infowars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[00:08:57.897 --> 00:09:01.897]  [Music]
[00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:06.897]   With most people I can come on here, and the people like this, they all go find Alex Sheldon's show.
[00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.666]  I've been delisted from everywhere.
[00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:16.569]  Let me out of prison to walk in the yard for a little while, and I can desperately try to, you know, get messages out by smoke signals.
[00:09:20.254 --> 00:09:25.258]  I mean, there's these wars, and there's the casual society, and the open borders, and all the race-baiting.
[00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:30.061]  I mean, we're being divided and conquered.
[00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.844]  That's why I hope you'll go look into this, and I hope you'll find out about it, because it is incredible.
[00:09:38.087 --> 00:09:40.108]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:47.843]   Wow, here we are on this Friday, global transmission, October 27th, 2023.
[00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:53.908]  Hard to believe the year is just a few months left and it's just crazy.
[00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:58.232]  And here we are at Mug Club, but this is trans insanity.
[00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:06.045]   50 year old biological male allowed to compete against 13 year olds in girls Swim meet.
[00:10:06.185 --> 00:10:09.208]  So, and this is also the pedophilia angle.
[00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:10.549]  I'm not saying this person's a pedophile.
[00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:15.133]  What I'm saying is, you have this movement to have adults identify as children as well.
[00:10:15.413 --> 00:10:17.795]  The meet was open age sections.
[00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:22.680]  So what happened is, that section is actually allow any age swimmer.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.886]  I don't, don't get into with me on age because it's all based on what Swimming Canada's registration.
[00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:39.873]  But Mr. Chan, what I don't understand is that 9 out of the 10 participants were female, and either 13 or 14, and the 10th participant was a male, 50 years of age.
[00:10:39.893 --> 00:10:49.899]  Okay, so, as I said, don't talk about gender for me, because I do not know, because the registration, whatever they enter, this is a 13 years old girl.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:50.300]  Yes.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:11:03.085]   This is just a few clips lately, I mean, we could have 10 hour long compilations just of what's caught on tape, but imagine one of these clips of white people Surrounding, kicking, beating, stabbing, running over, killing.
[00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:05.087]  It would be burning cities.
[00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:07.970]  Because the media would say all white people are guilty.
[00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:12.874]  Because they ganged up and killed this black person or hurt this black person.
[00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:15.436]  Just like they did with George Floyd.
[00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:20.041]  Even though it turns out he died of fentanyl and the rest of it and they didn't even have bruises on his neck.
[00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:25.279]  But the prosecutors have now come out in court, new, and said, we want to advance our careers.
[00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:28.921]  Let's put Officer Chauvin in prison for decades.
[00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.222]  So let's go ahead and play this compilation.
[00:11:33.264 --> 00:11:39.207]  Get that white devil.
[00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.166]  Get him!
[00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:46.666]  [crowd noise]
[00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.666]  Again, kids do mean stuff.
[00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:50.827]  I had white kids do stuff like this to me when I was little.
[00:11:51.768 --> 00:11:55.611]  But the point is, is imagine if we showed this with white people doing it.
[00:11:55.652 --> 00:11:56.232]  It'd be riots.
[00:11:58.394 --> 00:12:00.176]  And you know, white people occasionally do some of this.
[00:12:00.416 --> 00:12:00.937]  This goes on.
[00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:03.920]  But why is it not shown when this happens?
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.662]  You want me to show you all the elders?
[00:12:07.623 --> 00:12:09.686]  All the old people in nursing homes getting beat up by black people?
[00:12:10.267 --> 00:12:12.269]  But I'm telling you, this is out of control.
[00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:18.918]  And we need black people, particularly, to say the Democrats don't represent me, and we don't put up with this, we're not going along with it.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.183]  Then we've got John McAvee and Alex Jones shoot bare 50 cal rifles together.
[00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:24.183]  2014.
[00:12:24.223 --> 00:12:27.205]  God rest his soul.
[00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:30.407]  And then we've got my interview with Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:34.670]  He did a great interview with me, so we've augmented it, like I said.
[00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.372]  It's 2.0, the Alex Jones, Vivek Ramaswamy interview.
[00:12:39.732 --> 00:12:47.176]  We the people do sort out our differences in a constitutional republic, where every citizen's voice and vote counts equally with free speech and open debate.
[00:12:47.196 --> 00:12:47.817]  That's what we thought.
[00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:52.259]  And every little while, that ugly monster rears its head again.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.981]  Lay down your arms, you damned rebels!
[00:12:57.455 --> 00:13:03.280]  World War I was in some ways the physical conflict of that old world European monarchical worldview.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:16.412]   Well, that was because the British Empire, who was the villain of that war, not in World War II, Hitler was the bad guy there, side treaty, they literally said the German problem, the Austrian-Hungarian Because it was dominant in industry science.
[00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:19.454]  It was taken over not with the military, but with all of its inventions.
[00:13:19.874 --> 00:13:23.717]  So it was kind of the new America, but it was run by another royal family.
[00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:28.260]  So they had to kill the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and start all once you're dead on.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.783]  It's only you that keep shows like this and information like this up on here.
[00:13:32.803 --> 00:13:34.604]  So I want to thank all the Mug Club subscribers.
[00:13:35.605 --> 00:13:39.087]  I want to encourage anybody watching this later to go to jonescrotter.com if you're not a member.
[00:13:39.848 --> 00:13:41.769]  And it's like seven something bucks a month.
[00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:42.810]  There's discounts.
[00:13:47.413 --> 00:13:48.234]  All right, we're live.
[00:13:48.414 --> 00:13:50.836]  It's Friday, October 27th, 2023.
[00:13:52.217 --> 00:14:06.028]  And I got in here today to the broadcast, and right before I go on air, I put my headset on about two minutes before my earpiece, and I had left it at home.
[00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:16.501]  I'd left it at home and didn't have it, so I had to scrabble around and find one in a box and put batteries in it and get it all hooked up and find an earpiece and get ready.
[00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:17.562]  And I said, hey, it's okay.
[00:14:18.102 --> 00:14:22.846]  Got a great new investigative report that we played that's so important.
[00:14:22.866 --> 00:14:24.727]  If you missed it, it's at man.video.
[00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:26.228]  Really needs to get out there.
[00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:28.190]  Immigration invasion, worse than previously thought.
[00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:38.858]  And then we also got into one of the latest anti-gun compilations of the Deep State Wanting the Guns over the last few years because they're back more than ever saying, let's openly ban all semi-automatics.
[00:14:38.898 --> 00:14:40.459]  That's our big top story we're going to get into.
[00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:46.722]  And then I added that little four-minute promo for the show I shot that's premiering today.
[00:14:47.322 --> 00:14:55.086]  It's over two and a half hours long for Mug Club subscribers over there at Steven Crowder's Great Operations, so I thought I'd air that.
[00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:56.167]  Okay.
[00:14:57.182 --> 00:15:04.106]  We had some guests today, but we have cleaned the slate of those because I want to open the phones up on Friday, which is today.
[00:15:04.126 --> 00:15:10.210]  And I want to hear your calls on any issue, any comment, anything you want to cover.
[00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.210]  It's a free-for-all.
[00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:16.854]  All I ask is that you be a first-time caller or that you've not gotten through in the last year.
[00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:25.399]  I normally say free-for-all, totally open phones, or I say first-time callers, but let's give people a chance who've not been on the show in a year or so.
[00:15:26.244 --> 00:15:35.586]  And for first-time callers, to give people a chance that haven't had a chance to get on air to give us their takes on what's unfolding and going on around the world.
[00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:37.167]  Okay.
[00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:41.888]  It was mind-blowing to do the research last night and this morning for the show.
[00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:51.310]  And then more mind-blowing to get here before the show and try to go through over 200 articles I've got on my desk and decide what to hit first, because they're all insanely important.
[00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:59.130]   Obviously, airstrikes by the United States in the Middle East.
[00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.010]  We're going to be getting to all of that.
[00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.809]   Attacking targets in Syria and Biden saying he's ready to go to full war.
[00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:09.410]  Iran threatening full war.
[00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.370]  At the UN, we have those video clips.
[00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.730]   Their foreign minister, National Security Agency put on 24-hour watch as Israel readies
[00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.730]  ground offensive.
[00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.451]  They've already done several probes.
[00:16:20.267 --> 00:16:26.090]  Menace defeats a defense alliance could create a domino effect similar to World War I. I totally agree with that analysis.
[00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.091]  Here's the Iranian foreign minister threatening all-out war at the UN.
[00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:31.032]  We'll get to that video.
[00:16:32.132 --> 00:16:37.255]  There is just so much here to be breaking down today.
[00:16:37.835 --> 00:16:42.217]  And it is in mainstream news that Israel's Mossad created Hamas.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:53.804]  And it's been protecting Hamas and more evidence amounts that they let them attack on October 7th along with Shin Bet, not the general rank-and-file of the leadership.
[00:16:54.285 --> 00:17:01.387]  So the question is, was it Netanyahu's call or was it the rest of government that's basically in a civil war with the Likudniks doing it?
[00:17:01.407 --> 00:17:18.521]   And we had Patrick Byrne on, he's really a smart guy and he's pretty much right every time, saying from all his sources, and he was in the Middle East yesterday joining us, that this was a setup to get rid of Netanyahu, whether you like Netanyahu or don't like him, the globalists have been trying to get rid of him.
[00:17:19.682 --> 00:17:24.725]  And he's gone along with him on a lot of things like the lockdowns and turning the people of Israel into guinea pigs.
[00:17:25.466 --> 00:17:30.569]  But at the same time, that hasn't stopped the power structure from trying to remove him.
[00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.850]  So a lot of big developments there.
[00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.851]  What does that really mean?
[00:17:35.132 --> 00:17:40.275]  Remember, they pulled down the famous Robert E. Lee statute in Virginia.
[00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:52.105]   And It was then given, even though people paid for it over 100 years ago with donations, it was not given to any historic society or museum.
[00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:58.550]  It was given to a, quote, black organization, and they melted it down and destroyed it.
[00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:09.859]  This is just pure communism or what you'd see the Taliban do to blowing up ancient Buddhist and Hindu shrines.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.441]  It's a piece of history.
[00:18:13.311 --> 00:18:15.193]  And there were all these museums that wanted to buy it.
[00:18:15.993 --> 00:18:22.138]  But remember, they even took down Teddy Roosevelt's statue last year in New York, out front the big library.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.723]  And Teddy Roosevelt was a big guy who wanted to empower everybody.
[00:18:27.763 --> 00:18:33.668]  But because he's a white guy on a horse with a black man, a Native American marching in front of him, it was seen as, well, he's above them.
[00:18:33.688 --> 00:18:35.049]  Well, he's the president.
[00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.851]  He's going to step the presidents on top.
[00:18:38.432 --> 00:18:39.232]  And so they pulled it down.
[00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:40.854]  And the word is, they may destroy it.
[00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:46.924]  So the system just wants the power to destroy whatever they want, whenever they want, and erase history.
[00:18:50.747 --> 00:18:55.310]  I think it's stupid that they blew up all the old Soviet-era statues.
[00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.211]  Those are interesting.
[00:18:56.331 --> 00:19:01.074]  I don't like linen, but I still think it's interesting history.
[00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:06.301]  I mean, we have ancient statues of Caligula that was a horrible tyrant in Rome.
[00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:09.482]  They don't break those or get rid of those.
[00:19:10.062 --> 00:19:11.543]  But Robert E. Lee was not a tyrant.
[00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:13.044]  He was the top general in the North.
[00:19:14.164 --> 00:19:15.545]  They wanted him to lead the Northern Army.
[00:19:16.805 --> 00:19:18.006]  And it wasn't over slavery.
[00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:18.646]  He said that.
[00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:19.186]  It was clear.
[00:19:19.446 --> 00:19:21.707]  That's really a fable that the war was over slavery.
[00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:22.407]  It became that later.
[00:19:22.668 --> 00:19:24.428]  It was the abolitionists that helped start the war.
[00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:27.630]  And I would certainly support the abolitionists' cause.
[00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:34.275]   The North and South have been fighting over tariffs and over how the North was setting tariffs
[00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:39.715]   since the beginning of the country, which wasn't long before really the Civil War,
[00:19:39.715 --> 00:19:44.514]  only about 70, 80 years before. So that's just the history.
[00:19:44.514 --> 00:19:51.585]   So Robert E. Lee, until recently, there were a lot of bases named after him
[00:19:51.585 --> 00:19:58.384]   and Fort Hood's named after Confederate General. They had a force about 20% of the North and no
[00:19:58.384 --> 00:20:08.005]   factories to make weapons and they beat the North for the first about 80% of the war. And
[00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:15.545]   so all over the world, including in England, they studied the Southern troops and
[00:20:15.545 --> 00:20:20.874]   a lot of the special operations units and things you see, the proliferated after World War I and
[00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:27.475]   World War II were modeled after the Confederate soldiers and their tactics.
[00:20:26.876 --> 00:20:38.599]  So, and back then when you won a war, you reconciled with the other side, and there was reconciliation, and so a lot of military bases and ships and things were named after Confederate generals.
[00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:42.965]  And to attack that is to attack really American heritage.
[00:20:44.146 --> 00:20:46.147]  I wish our country would never have had that civil war.
[00:20:46.707 --> 00:20:47.948]  The Rothschilds are on record.
[00:20:48.068 --> 00:20:48.929]  It's declassified.
[00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.733]  They were financing both sides, trying to split the country up, and the British intelligence was involved in it.
[00:20:54.813 --> 00:21:01.739]  And it's the same way that the Rothschilds funded both Napoleon and the British side in those wars.
[00:21:03.746 --> 00:21:06.428]  Show that culminated the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.
[00:21:06.488 --> 00:21:10.911]  So when you know history, you understand all this.
[00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:19.678]  I mean, there are statues of Napoleon Bonaparte, who you could argue was a tyrant, certainly an authoritarian, in France today.
[00:21:19.818 --> 00:21:22.279]  And why would you not want to go look at those?
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.903]  No one's talking about tearing out his mausoleum or statues of him.
[00:21:27.783 --> 00:21:29.465]  Why would you do that?
[00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.205]  It's historical.
[00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:30.825]  It's interesting.
[00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:31.546]  It's informative.
[00:21:33.593 --> 00:21:38.134]  But this is what real totalitarians of the mind do.
[00:21:38.854 --> 00:21:44.975]  So just really archetypal chilling footage of them cutting the face off of Robert E. Lee.
[00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:46.255]  It's bigger than life.
[00:21:46.275 --> 00:21:47.056]  It's this huge face.
[00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:50.916]  It's at scale about 10 times bigger than an average face.
[00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:52.076]  It's a huge statue.
[00:21:53.077 --> 00:21:57.657]  And then putting it in a furnace and then ripping it apart piece by piece.
[00:21:58.098 --> 00:22:00.058]  And it looks like it's living while it's happening.
[00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.512]  And Lee lost everything he had in the war and was very, very depressed about it and hated it.
[00:22:06.813 --> 00:22:10.775]  And he had to sit there and watch hundreds of thousands of people on both sides die and bleed out.
[00:22:11.676 --> 00:22:12.636]  And it was absolute hell.
[00:22:13.997 --> 00:22:26.824]  And he is, after George Washington, he is, of course, his grandfather and father were in the, uh, his grandfather was in the Revolutionary War, general.
[00:22:27.845 --> 00:22:30.446]  But, but the whole point is, is that this is Americana.
[00:22:31.358 --> 00:22:36.360]  And after George Washington, historians until recently said he was probably the second greatest American general.
[00:22:37.201 --> 00:22:40.262]  And I said this back when they pulled down a statue, and so did Trump.
[00:22:42.183 --> 00:22:45.705]  Next, they're going to want to pull down George Washington, and they're going to pull down Thomas Jefferson.
[00:22:45.725 --> 00:22:47.606]  And they are pulling down George Washington statues.
[00:22:47.626 --> 00:22:50.367]  In fact, they're set to pull it down.
[00:22:51.067 --> 00:22:56.910]  They say they are sometime next year in New York, the big, gorgeous statue.
[00:22:57.942 --> 00:23:00.703]  I'm saying like he's a gorgeous person, but a big, beautiful horse.
[00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.224]  It's like, you know, 10 times scale.
[00:23:03.664 --> 00:23:08.086]  And it's just incredible bronze work that they say we can't even do today.
[00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:09.686]  These people were so skilled back then.
[00:23:10.126 --> 00:23:14.088]  And then it's George Washington on that horse pointing forward up this huge avenue.
[00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:15.768]  And I've shot some reports there.
[00:23:15.848 --> 00:23:18.549]  They're going to tear that down.
[00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.830]  George Washington now, folks.
[00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:23.711]  Unbelievable.
[00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:33.219]   Because they want to demonize The foundation of the country, its history, what it is, and the new flag is the rainbow flag of satanism and pedophilia.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:43.090]  No longer LGBTQ+, it's now LGBTQS and P, or P and S. I mean, literally, pedophilia, satanism.
[00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.555]  That is openly promoted now, and that is the new flag of this country.
[00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:53.631]   in Democrat-controlled areas, you don't really see American flags or state flags.
[00:23:53.631 --> 00:24:00.590]   You see the rainbow flag of hell. And you see all the other flags.
[00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:06.590]   And I was wearing a NASA shirt that's like 20-something years old, and it's got a rainbow
[00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.990]   on it. And that means for the atmosphere. It's not a full rainbow, but it's three or four of the colors.
[00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.670]  And I've had friends say, "Why are you wearing that shirt?"
[00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:20.150]  I'm like, "Well, the rainbow doesn't belong to these people.
[00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.671]   Just because they say it belongs to them, it doesn't."
[00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:29.935]  I think I'm going to launch some type of movement to bring the rainbow back and say this is God's colors.
[00:24:30.815 --> 00:24:44.305]  Because in Genesis, God talks about the rainbow and how it's a promise to humanity of God's love, and not to destroy us by water again, but next time by fire.
[00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:46.666]  What a sweet, loving promise.
[00:24:47.707 --> 00:24:48.888]  Yeah, there's the statue of New York.
[00:24:49.927 --> 00:24:54.375]  Uh, even cooler, because I've seen both in person, than the Robert E. Lee.
[00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:56.278]  I mean, it is just, you gotta be there to see it.
[00:24:57.119 --> 00:24:59.123]  Just a photo, you don't get how massive it is.
[00:24:59.143 --> 00:25:00.385]  And it's just interesting.
[00:25:00.425 --> 00:25:00.926]  I mean, it's like...
[00:25:01.877 --> 00:25:02.597]  I'm not British.
[00:25:02.617 --> 00:25:04.217]  I don't follow Lord Nelson.
[00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:08.838]  But when you're in Trafalgar Square and there's that giant statue, it's like the Statue of Liberty.
[00:25:08.878 --> 00:25:10.119]  People say, oh, it's occultic, whatever.
[00:25:10.659 --> 00:25:12.819]  Still, yeah, the French gave it to us.
[00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:14.339]  It's a guy in drag.
[00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:15.960]  I mean, that's well known.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.840]  It's in the occult stuff.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.840]  Still, I don't want to tear it down.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.880]  It's very interesting.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.021]  It's very cool if you're out there, you know, in a boat at night, as I've done a few times.
[00:25:25.021 --> 00:25:28.082]  And by the Statue of Liberty, it's just spectacular.
[00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:32.220]  Uh, and I guess you could argue, you know, it's a white guy.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:39.183]  Uh, so, uh, you, uh, got to get rid of it too.
[00:25:42.524 --> 00:25:53.509]  Cause we, you know, we're, we're named after the goddess Columbia and, and, and they follow the, uh, the mystery school cults follow Diana in the UK.
[00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:56.008]  In Texas, it's another goddess.
[00:25:56.028 --> 00:25:56.949]  They're on top of the capitals.
[00:25:56.989 --> 00:26:03.394]  But this one the French sent, you can look at the background, it's a male god, a male hermaphroditic goddess.
[00:26:03.955 --> 00:26:05.036]  So it's extremely occult.
[00:26:06.397 --> 00:26:08.138]  But is it evil in and of itself?
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.682]  I mean, I guess the Bible says, have no gods before me and have no idols.
[00:26:12.702 --> 00:26:13.583]  Well, I don't worship it.
[00:26:14.504 --> 00:26:19.668]  I mean, people saying, oh, you can't have a statue, but you can worship the NFL.
[00:26:19.688 --> 00:26:22.991]  Well, what God's saying is, don't put anything ahead of me.
[00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:27.812]  And if you see it as art, it's fine, but are we going to pull everything down here?
[00:26:28.693 --> 00:26:29.854]  So I didn't mean to digress on that.
[00:26:29.914 --> 00:26:32.155]  Elon Musk has come out with comments on it that I agree with.
[00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:34.357]  This is a serious situation.
[00:26:34.377 --> 00:26:35.037]  So we have the war.
[00:26:35.638 --> 00:26:36.839]  We have the destruction of culture.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.264]  We have the first minister, the leader of Scotland, saying white people are inherently bad.
[00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:47.847]  He's the, of course, he's a Pakistani.
[00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:51.750]  Of course, I can't go over to Pakistan and even practice Christianity, you'll get killed.
[00:26:52.456 --> 00:26:56.456]   for blasphemy and I'm sure it's all I'm going to go over there and like say elect me your president
[00:26:56.456 --> 00:27:01.416]   or prime minister they'd laugh at me but he literally lectures them and says you are bad
[00:27:01.416 --> 00:27:05.736]   and they agree they go we are bad yes sir he says well we're going to bring all the refugees in now
[00:27:05.736 --> 00:27:11.576]   and they say yes sir man they got the scots cucked british couldn't conquer them for 800 years but
[00:27:11.576 --> 00:27:18.135]   man they are cucked now well there's a lot of excitement and bated breath that biden's going
[00:27:18.135 --> 00:27:32.886]   to start bombing more targets raise my seat here That Biden's going to attack even more targets in the Middle East after bombing Syrian targets.
[00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:35.028]  Finally, is the headline from town hall.
[00:27:35.648 --> 00:27:38.331]  US carries out strikes on Iranian facilities in Syria.
[00:27:39.692 --> 00:27:41.113]  But were they enough?
[00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:48.179]  US strikes two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militants in Syria following a series of attacks on US forces in the Middle East.
[00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.910]  U.S.
[00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.812]  warplanes conduct major strikes on Iranian proxies in Syria.
[00:27:54.772 --> 00:28:05.176]  This is after Obama spent years, and then Trump had to clean it up with Putin, trying to overthrow the Syrian government and install ISIS, which is another name for Al Qaeda.
[00:28:06.557 --> 00:28:10.759]  National Security Agency put on 24-hour watch as Israel readies ground offensive.
[00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:15.961]  Middle East Defense Alliance could create a domino effect similar to World War I.
[00:28:17.193 --> 00:28:18.854]  Excellent article, we'll be going over it.
[00:28:18.934 --> 00:28:25.079]  But first, let's play the Iranian Foreign Minister issues a direct warning to the United States, the UN.
[00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:34.665]  I say, frankly, the Americans, we'll play the clip in a moment, who are now managing the war in Gaza, that we do not want the expansion of the war in the region.
[00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:40.029]  But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they, the Americans, will not be spared from the fire.
[00:28:40.369 --> 00:28:41.070]  This is our home.
[00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.111]  And West Asia is our region.
[00:28:43.511 --> 00:28:46.573]  We do not compromise with any party on any side.
[00:28:46.593 --> 00:28:50.336]  And we have no reservation when it comes to our home security.
[00:28:52.157 --> 00:28:54.318]  I do not support Islamic expansion.
[00:28:55.419 --> 00:28:56.500]  I do not support Iran.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.361]  I do not support any of these countries over there.
[00:28:58.781 --> 00:29:00.983]  And I don't want their refugees, something being pushed.
[00:29:01.743 --> 00:29:04.505]  That said, I don't support carpet bombing women and children.
[00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:08.648]  And saying they're children of the darkness and we're children of the light.
[00:29:09.188 --> 00:29:10.349]  Two wrongs don't make a right.
[00:29:12.052 --> 00:29:18.100]  And it's upwards of 8,000 Gazans that have died now versus 1,300 plus Israelis.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.081]  The whole thing's terrible.
[00:29:20.082 --> 00:29:27.291]  But where's the larger discussion of Israel helping found Hamas or the governments that were in power then in the 70s or the fact that was a clear standout?
[00:29:27.691 --> 00:29:28.512]  This is a trigger.
[00:29:29.861 --> 00:29:41.948]  For a wider regional war, the globalists want to bring in the world financial collapse, and to blame it on the war, not themselves, not the bubbles they created, not the factual reserve banking, and then to bring in the new global currency on its back.
[00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:44.890]  They admit that at the UN and the World Economic Forum.
[00:29:45.731 --> 00:29:55.917]  So Ukraine, and now this, and the COVID lockdowns, and the climate fake crisis, and the banning of farms all over the world, is meant to bring the world into a collapse scenario.
[00:29:57.861 --> 00:30:00.702]  So here is the Iranian Foreign Minister at the UN.
[00:30:01.862 --> 00:30:16.244]  I say frankly to the American statesmen who are now managing the genocide in Palestine that we do not welcome to expansion of the war in the region.
[00:30:16.924 --> 00:30:25.786]  But I warn if the genocide in Gaza continues they will not be spared from this fire.
[00:30:27.102 --> 00:30:28.042]  It is our home.
[00:30:28.783 --> 00:30:31.983]  And West Asia is our region.
[00:30:34.044 --> 00:30:38.886]  We do not compromise with any party and any side.
[00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:46.705]   and we have no reservation when it comes to our home's security.
[00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:49.705]  And basically threatening the United States.
[00:30:49.705 --> 00:30:53.705]   So this situation is deteriorating obviously very, very quickly.
[00:30:53.705 --> 00:31:01.705]   I now have English dubbed version of what we showed you yesterday of Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:03.705]  We'll play that in a moment.
[00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:07.705]   Saying, "We are the people of the light. They are the people of the darkness."
[00:31:08.444 --> 00:31:12.068]  And when he says that, he says in general, the people in Gaza.
[00:31:12.548 --> 00:31:17.373]  Folks, that's what a large portion of the people in Gaza are saying about the Israelis, about the Jews.
[00:31:18.414 --> 00:31:21.356]  And it's wrong to take a whole group of people and say they're bad.
[00:31:22.352 --> 00:31:25.473]  And it's wrong to take a whole group of other people and say that.
[00:31:25.493 --> 00:31:35.516]  And I watch the videos, I've seen like 30 of them now, of leftist, mainly white people, all over the US and Europe, pulling down pictures of the kidnapped Israelis.
[00:31:36.236 --> 00:31:40.658]  Because they don't want them humanized, and they have such hatred in their eyes while they're doing it.
[00:31:42.261 --> 00:31:46.622]  Whereas I see the extreme hate that a lot of the Muslims have for Jews, and I think it's disgusting.
[00:31:47.423 --> 00:31:50.724]  It's just as disgusting when people just out of hand hate Jews.
[00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:57.906]  And I know that's fashionable to hate Jews, and my job is not to be an apologist for Jews, but Jews are a diverse group.
[00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:01.987]  Just like when I say Xi Jinping is bad, I don't say the Chinese are bad.
[00:32:03.027 --> 00:32:08.369]  And this is tribal warfare, this is dangerous Armageddon type rhetoric.
[00:32:09.488 --> 00:32:11.790]  And no one can deny that that's the case.
[00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:30.088]  And to say that this is Isaiah and the prophecy being fulfilled and invoking Guter Dammerung, Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok type stuff is extremely apocalyptic.
[00:32:31.169 --> 00:32:32.671]  Here's Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:32:34.268 --> 00:32:38.833]  Our war against Hamas is a test for all of humanity.
[00:32:39.093 --> 00:32:45.920]  It is a struggle between the axis of evil of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas and the axis of freedom and progress.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.583]  We are the people of the light.
[00:32:48.623 --> 00:32:52.767]  They are the people of darkness and light shall triumph over darkness.
[00:32:54.168 --> 00:33:01.194]  Citizens of Israel, October 7th was a very dark and black day in our history.
[00:33:01.314 --> 00:33:07.879]  We will fully investigate what had happened at our southern border, the border with Gaza.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:16.186]  Everybody will have to provide answers, myself included, but all that will happen only after the war.
[00:33:16.286 --> 00:33:28.996]   As a Prime Minister, I'm responsible for guaranteeing the future of this country and now my role is to lead All Israelis, the State of Israel and the people of Israel to an overpowering victory.
[00:33:29.076 --> 00:33:35.260]  It is now a time to come together for one purpose, to storm ahead to achieve victory.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:48.090]  And joined with joint forces and a profound belief in our justness, a profound belief in the eternity of the Jewish people, we shall realize the prophecy of Isaiah.
[00:33:48.130 --> 00:34:17.386]   There will no longer be So that's classic tribal warfare, classic ancient religious warfare, and we are right in the middle of it, sucked into it, and Israel is a nuclear power, and it's surrounded by all these hostile states, and like somebody flipped a light switch when Trump was removed from office,
[00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:20.392]  All of this hell got released.
[00:34:22.993 --> 00:34:27.135]  Now, it's one thing to say Hamas is evil and dark, and use that analogy.
[00:34:28.695 --> 00:34:29.476]  And I would agree with that.
[00:34:30.716 --> 00:34:36.079]  But when you say, we are the people of light, they are the people of darkness, that's what Hitler said.
[00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:40.220]  He said, we are the people of light, and the Jews are the people of darkness, and we're going to kill them all.
[00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:42.641]  That's pretty much a Hitler quote.
[00:34:42.661 --> 00:34:43.842]  I mean, he said things just like that.
[00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:50.785]  I don't care if you're German or you're Jewish or you're Chinese or you're Mexican.
[00:34:51.626 --> 00:34:56.771]  When you start saying that whole group over there is evil and we're going to destroy them, they got a name for that.
[00:34:57.852 --> 00:34:58.732]  It's called genocide.
[00:34:59.793 --> 00:35:08.642]  And it fits the definition when you say this whole group, including newborn babies, are the bad guys.
[00:35:11.084 --> 00:35:11.645]  It's just wrong.
[00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:23.035]  And then you have the sickening left, allied with Islam and allied with Hamas, who is saying stuff even more intense, but similar, about Israel.
[00:35:24.095 --> 00:35:24.716]  It's a bear trap.
[00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:26.436]  It's a vice grip.
[00:35:26.716 --> 00:35:27.517]  It's a disaster.
[00:35:28.348 --> 00:35:44.441]  And so, I don't like what Benjamin Netanyahu's saying, and I don't like what Hamas is saying, I don't like what Iran's saying, but I just want to remind you, the UN and the media is telling us, humans are all bad for the Earth, and our cows are bad, and everything's bad, so let them take control of us and depopulate us.
[00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:52.107]  That's pretty Hitlerian, and Yavall Narara Harari says that the human civilization's over, and we're garbage, and we're useless.
[00:35:52.648 --> 00:35:55.851]  That's actual Hitler quotes, non-essential, useless ears.
[00:35:56.704 --> 00:36:03.448]  And then we got boys told they're girls and girls told they're boys, and then we have taught via the ADL's training all over the U.S.
[00:36:03.488 --> 00:36:07.290]  and Europe that being white is inherently bad, unless you're Jewish.
[00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:14.255]  It's just a free-for-all of tribalism and racism, and then they turn around to the few groups that aren't for all this.
[00:36:14.395 --> 00:36:14.935]  I'm a Christian.
[00:36:14.975 --> 00:36:16.936]  I want unity under freedom.
[00:36:16.956 --> 00:36:19.058]  I'm not going to make you follow Christ, but that's the model.
[00:36:19.998 --> 00:36:27.202]  And we're the ones called racist by the very groups using race-based politics for control because it's very deep-seated and it works.
[00:36:27.242 --> 00:36:33.246]  That's how we organized ourselves previous to modern civilization that Europe created and launched.
[00:36:33.766 --> 00:36:38.969]  So we're throwing away Christendom and replacing it with tribalism, barbarism, and Armageddon.
[00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:39.570]  We'll be right back.
[00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.872]  It's Friday, final second of the first hour, October 27th, 2023.
[00:36:43.912 --> 00:36:48.115]  I'm going to open the phones up in the second and third hour today.
[00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:55.947]  I'm going to give the toll-free number out here just a moment for first-time callers and folks that haven't called in a year or so.
[00:36:56.368 --> 00:37:01.329]  That way people that haven't had a chance to get in can get in and it'll be any topic, any subject, anything you want to discuss.
[00:37:01.389 --> 00:37:08.890]  I want to get into the shutting off of the food supplies and how that's accelerating and the borders being beyond completely collapsed.
[00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.931]  They're actually luring people here and I want to break down those latest numbers.
[00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:13.652]  You can't make this up.
[00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:14.852]  Federal government releases new numbers.
[00:37:14.872 --> 00:37:15.753]  This is just who they caught.
[00:37:15.773 --> 00:37:17.854]  Or who they took in.
[00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:21.357]  Six... hundred... Listen to this.
[00:37:21.917 --> 00:37:30.483]  Sixty-six thousand, six hundred, six, six, six... Venezuelans crossed the southern U.S.-Mexico border last month, surpassing Mexicans coming in.
[00:37:33.263 --> 00:37:35.906]  So, we're going to lay out some of those numbers here.
[00:37:36.226 --> 00:37:40.230]  They are now ordering the cows killed in Ireland, quote, for the earth.
[00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:47.257]  It's an ancient, basically, sacrifice to just sell ourselves on the state having total control.
[00:37:47.337 --> 00:37:48.819]  It's another humiliation ritual.
[00:37:49.299 --> 00:37:51.061]  I'll be explaining that at the start of the next hour.
[00:37:51.121 --> 00:37:53.924]  We have a Paul Watson report we're going to play as well.
[00:37:55.532 --> 00:37:56.652]  But we have some good news.
[00:37:56.692 --> 00:37:59.753]  Good news for you, good news for this operation, because we need funds to operate.
[00:37:59.773 --> 00:38:03.234]  Plus, these are really amazing products that will enrich and empower your life.
[00:38:04.135 --> 00:38:05.195]  We have three new tropics.
[00:38:05.735 --> 00:38:09.036]  Turbo Force, Brain Force Plus, and Brain Force Ultra.
[00:38:09.096 --> 00:38:10.537]  They're all three different...
[00:38:11.397 --> 00:38:12.217]  Different formulas.
[00:38:12.297 --> 00:38:27.002]  A top sports nutritionist, who obviously didn't want his name in public, years ago we said we want the strongest, cleanest, best 10-hour clean energy you can have for people that just need long extended incredible energy without the big letdown.
[00:38:27.022 --> 00:38:28.602]  You're still going to get some when it's this strong.
[00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:29.382]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:38:29.783 --> 00:38:31.783]  But compared to other stuff, it's negligible.
[00:38:32.863 --> 00:38:35.926]   We want a good basic Neutropic.
[00:38:35.987 --> 00:38:43.282]  We went to another company that just really doesn't have any letdown and it's good five to six hours of focused energy that's not jittery.
[00:38:43.302 --> 00:38:44.244]  That's Brain Force Plus.
[00:38:45.916 --> 00:38:46.976]  TurboForce is sold out.
[00:38:47.016 --> 00:38:48.717]  BrainForce Plus is about to sell out.
[00:38:48.797 --> 00:38:49.837]  It's no longer on sale.
[00:38:49.917 --> 00:38:54.799]  But what is on sale is something that I came up with talking to, again, one of the top labs in the country.
[00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.080]  I went to him.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:02.582]  I said, I want something that hits really quick, is super clean with no letdown, that lasts three hours.
[00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:04.743]  They came back about six months later.
[00:39:05.123 --> 00:39:06.423]  They said, we've tested a bunch of stuff.
[00:39:06.463 --> 00:39:07.324]  Nobody's ever thought of this.
[00:39:07.384 --> 00:39:08.124]  It's a great idea.
[00:39:08.464 --> 00:39:09.965]  You take it out of the tongue, not a pill.
[00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:14.206]  It hits in 15-20 minutes and lasts for the average three hours.
[00:39:14.226 --> 00:39:15.427]  Some people four hours, some two.
[00:39:15.987 --> 00:39:17.968]  And a lot of times I gotta do a 10 o'clock at night show.
[00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:18.828]  I've already been working all day.
[00:39:18.988 --> 00:39:19.969]  I usually get up at 5 a.m.
[00:39:20.709 --> 00:39:21.349]  I'm exhausted.
[00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:27.352]  I can take a dropper of this under my tongue at 9 o'clock.
[00:39:27.572 --> 00:39:29.553]  I can do the hour or two long show.
[00:39:31.354 --> 00:39:39.037]  Or if it's friends in town that want to go see a comedy club or go hang out with Joe Rogan at his place, which I do a lot, I will take some Rainforce Ultra.
[00:39:40.313 --> 00:39:43.774]  And so I'll leave the house at about 8 or sometimes, you know, 7, go eat dinner.
[00:39:43.794 --> 00:39:46.535]  A lot of times with Joe, go to his comedy club or go out with other friends.
[00:39:47.296 --> 00:39:48.616]  And then I don't stay to the end.
[00:39:48.656 --> 00:39:49.857]  I usually leave about 10, 30 or 11.
[00:39:50.037 --> 00:39:53.718]  And I get home, 11, 30, boom, hit the pillow, sleep great.
[00:39:54.818 --> 00:39:56.879]  Hit the pillow, sleep great.
[00:39:57.399 --> 00:39:58.500]  This is really special.

[00:41:47.528 --> 00:41:48.929]  We want to send it to number one.
[00:41:48.929 --> 00:41:52.288]   Like the last book did, we wouldn't be on air if it wasn't for you getting the last book.
[00:41:52.288 --> 00:41:54.648]   If it wasn't for you getting the signed books, you know who you are.
[00:41:54.648 --> 00:41:57.047]  For myself and everybody, thanks for keeping us on air.
[00:41:57.047 --> 00:42:02.887]   Get The Great Awakening, the second part, and twice as long, really powerful, really proud of it.
[00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:06.128]   The other book, that was a great book and important in the Death Star plans
[00:42:06.128 --> 00:42:07.329]  and what the enemy's up to.
[00:42:07.329 --> 00:42:12.248]   This is the enemy's developments, who they are, and then how to stop them in a better world to build.
[00:42:12.248 --> 00:42:14.929]   I spent probably four or five times longer writing this book.
[00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:19.668]  I spent eight months, I mean, meetings every other day.
[00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:21.812]  And we had to, it ended up being like 700 pages long.
[00:42:21.832 --> 00:42:22.613]  We had to cut it down.
[00:42:22.733 --> 00:42:24.374]  It's, it's powerful.
[00:42:24.915 --> 00:42:31.099]  So get the Great Awakening, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:33.821]  And InfoWars Platinum.
[00:42:37.003 --> 00:42:39.044]  Great line of products is also back in stock.
[00:42:39.865 --> 00:42:41.386]  HH Max Boost is about to sell out.
[00:42:41.406 --> 00:42:44.348]  7076 Testosterone Boost and PainMD, all that.
[00:42:45.706 --> 00:42:46.746]  Impulwarstore.com.
[00:42:46.946 --> 00:42:48.487]  Okay, let me do this.
[00:42:48.847 --> 00:42:53.788]  Let me give the toll-free number out on any issue you want to raise, any comment you have, you agree, you disagree.
[00:42:53.848 --> 00:42:54.948]  We don't censor your calls.
[00:42:55.808 --> 00:43:00.009]  All I ask for is that you have a clean phone line.
[00:43:01.129 --> 00:43:03.329]  And I actually like people that disagree, too.
[00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.690]  So don't be shy.
[00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.150]  And I'm a lot nicer than I used to be.
[00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.171]  I don't usually blow up at people I disagree with anymore.
[00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:11.131]  That used to be entertaining.
[00:43:12.014 --> 00:43:14.495]  I blew up at one person earlier this week, and I apologize.
[00:43:15.115 --> 00:43:20.938]  That's just because they don't know how frustrated I am, just like them, dealing with all this.
[00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:26.060]  But it is literally your funding that changes all of that, and that allows us to win this fight.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.502]  I'm not going to spend all day with what the enemy's doing behind the scenes and publicly to shut us down.
[00:43:30.582 --> 00:43:31.503]  It's spectacular.
[00:43:32.903 --> 00:43:36.505]  And as long as I just go as hard as I can and leave it to God, I trust God.
[00:43:36.885 --> 00:43:37.806]  But God works through you.
[00:43:38.925 --> 00:43:39.565]  I'm digressing.
[00:43:40.146 --> 00:43:48.710]  The toll-free number to join us on the completely imploded government, the giant child trafficking confirmed by Congress, sex slavery, slave labor, you name it.
[00:43:49.411 --> 00:43:51.372]  We've got so much more interspersed.
[00:43:51.432 --> 00:43:56.495]  The now leader of Scotland says white people are bad and shouldn't be involved in government.
[00:43:57.675 --> 00:43:58.676]  That's a big controversy.
[00:43:58.696 --> 00:43:59.556]  I mean, why not?
[00:43:59.977 --> 00:44:02.498]  The more people get beaten up in the head because they're white, the more they submit.
[00:44:03.859 --> 00:44:06.060]  But as long as you keep submitting to it, it's only going to get worse.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:13.846]  Oh, we elect you the leader, and then you tell us we're bad again, so we grovel more to you.
[00:44:13.866 --> 00:44:15.707]  We have to do whatever you say politically.
[00:44:16.108 --> 00:44:20.692]  Carbon taxes, and open borders, and bring in the Muslim refugees, because he's a Muslim.
[00:44:21.232 --> 00:44:26.597]  Literally opening the gate to bring people in, and then tell you you're bad because you're Christian, to tell you you're bad because you're white.
[00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:29.640]  Stop letting people beat you over the head!
[00:44:31.434 --> 00:44:42.703]  We don't hate people that are brown or Muslim or whatever, but when they organize into groups and say we're bad because we grovel to them, it's gonna let the racist in their groups get in control because it's effective.
[00:44:44.304 --> 00:44:47.186]  I mean, white people are committing cultural suicide.
[00:44:47.366 --> 00:44:48.728]  And so is everybody else in the New World Order.
[00:44:49.088 --> 00:44:51.029]  And you look at these poison shots, and oh boy.
[00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:59.316]  I even get sick of talking about the aftermath of COVID and all the death and destruction and all the studies and the proof of what's happening, but it is insane now.
[00:45:01.095 --> 00:45:01.776]  What's going on?
[00:45:01.856 --> 00:45:03.017]  I'll hit that too next hour.
[00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:08.021]  Eight-year-old Israeli poster child for COVID vaccine dies of sudden cardiac arrest.
[00:45:08.762 --> 00:45:10.703]  That stack is just over-the-top chilling.
[00:45:12.004 --> 00:45:18.890]  The melting down secretly, and I think really illegally, of the famous Robert E. Lee statute in Virginia.
[00:45:21.492 --> 00:45:22.773]  Private donors pay to have it made.
[00:45:22.914 --> 00:45:26.316]  Decades later, people take it, and then it's given as a talisman.
[00:45:27.409 --> 00:45:31.655]  of ritual humiliation to the Black Culture Museum so they can melt it.
[00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:35.180]  I mean, it's all just systematic idiocy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:35.681 --> 00:45:37.303]  We're talking about the Communist tactics.
[00:45:37.323 --> 00:45:38.685]  This is right out of Mao's playbook.
[00:45:39.346 --> 00:45:40.107]  Let me start the next hour.
[00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:42.412]  All these topics are up for grabs.
[00:45:42.472 --> 00:45:45.292]  Any topics you want to raise, love the wildcard nature of that.
[00:45:45.773 --> 00:45:47.373]  It is a free-for-all, as they say.
[00:45:47.393 --> 00:45:47.433]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:47.653]  877-789-Alex.
[00:45:47.673 --> 00:45:47.753]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:47.773 --> 00:45:52.855]  If you're calling from outside the country and a toll-free number doesn't work sometimes, dial the country code at 512-646-1776.
[00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:52.995]  512-646-1776.
[00:45:52.815 --> 00:45:58.684]   877-789-2539. If you're calling from outside the country and a toll-free number doesn't work, sometimes, dial the
[00:45:58.684 --> 00:46:03.815]  country code at 512-646-1776.
[00:46:03.815 --> 00:46:11.815]   512-646-1776. So, hour number two and three of your calls, and then the amazing, informative,
[00:46:11.815 --> 00:46:18.815]   Jay Dyer hosting the fourth hour today, ahead of Owen Schroer hosting today at 3 p.m.
[00:46:18.592 --> 00:46:18.932]  Central.
[00:46:19.032 --> 00:46:19.953]  Oh wait, sorry.
[00:46:20.434 --> 00:46:28.182]  He's in federal prison in Louisiana, the judge said, because he still says the election was stolen, in his in his sentencing document.
[00:46:28.863 --> 00:46:36.628]  The judge said no less than three times, I'm giving you a prison sentence because the feds reported to the judge and said, look, he said it again last month, this month.
[00:46:36.968 --> 00:46:37.708]  He's still saying it.
[00:46:37.748 --> 00:46:38.849]  The judge said, that's it.
[00:46:39.689 --> 00:46:40.690]  You're going to prison.
[00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.411]  People are like, well, it's only 60 days.
[00:46:43.452 --> 00:46:44.592]  Well, next time it'll be longer.
[00:46:44.652 --> 00:46:45.273]  Don't you worry.
[00:46:45.833 --> 00:46:47.414]  But the judge just did gagging Trump.
[00:46:47.714 --> 00:46:49.195]  First 5,000, now 10,000.
[00:46:49.635 --> 00:46:50.956]  Next, the judge is going to default him.
[00:46:50.996 --> 00:46:52.077]  The judge already found him guilty.
[00:46:52.097 --> 00:46:52.757]  There's no jury.
[00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.398]  So that's how they do it.
[00:46:55.539 --> 00:46:57.179]  Keep your dirty American mouth shut.
[00:46:56.999 --> 00:47:11.039]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:13.418]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:47:13.699 --> 00:47:20.699]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.699 --> 00:47:38.699]  [Music]
[00:47:38.699 --> 00:47:48.699]  [Applause]
[00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:54.699]   In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:58.699]   whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:47:58.699 --> 00:48:00.699]  [Music]
[00:48:01.132 --> 00:48:04.652]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:48:04.652 --> 00:48:08.532]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:48:08.532 --> 00:48:10.851]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[00:48:10.855 --> 00:48:11.215]  Louis.
[00:48:11.516 --> 00:48:18.561]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:48:18.721 --> 00:48:23.245]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:24.386]  Guns will be taken.
[00:48:24.406 --> 00:48:25.627]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:48:25.907 --> 00:48:26.888]  We will take all weapons.
[00:48:27.088 --> 00:48:29.430]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:33.854]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:48:34.034 --> 00:48:34.334]  Enough.
[00:48:36.756 --> 00:48:36.976]  Enough.
[00:48:37.117 --> 00:48:41.620]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.644]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:48:47.765 --> 00:49:01.134]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, or recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:49:01.254 --> 00:49:03.856]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:49:04.857 --> 00:49:06.438]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:49:07.279 --> 00:49:13.282]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:49:13.562 --> 00:49:18.225]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[00:49:18.325 --> 00:49:23.044]   heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house
[00:49:23.044 --> 00:49:35.864]   It's a joint military training exercise involving local police also military
[00:49:35.864 --> 00:49:37.864]  In your apartment! - Sorry?
[00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:38.689]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:39.832]  Go back inside right now!
[00:49:39.972 --> 00:49:40.714]  I am inside.
[00:49:40.995 --> 00:49:42.058]  I have two words for you.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.762]  Predator groans.
[00:49:44.704 --> 00:49:45.747]  You will never see it coming.
[00:49:49.764 --> 00:49:52.226]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:49:52.607 --> 00:50:01.795]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:07.119]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:50:07.339 --> 00:50:12.123]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[00:50:12.404 --> 00:50:14.445]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:50:16.112 --> 00:50:17.514]  We are on the march.
[00:50:17.894 --> 00:50:20.437]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:50:20.537 --> 00:50:25.537]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50:25.537 --> 00:50:39.537]  [Music]
[00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:45.537]   The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:50:45.962 --> 00:50:48.784]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:50:52.105 --> 00:51:02.589]  And now the FBI says the official number one enemy is white people and the American people and they got one of their rare mass shootings with a white guy in Maine and still have that whole state on lockdown.
[00:51:02.709 --> 00:51:03.710]  They don't even know where he is.
[00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:08.592]  He's obviously hanging out in the deep woods there somewhere, some of the deepest on this continent.
[00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:16.290]  But Israel has now completely, in the areas they control, cut the power, everything off to Gaza.
[00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.431]  Massive bombardments going on.
[00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:22.232]  It's breaking right now, and it looks like the main invasion has started out.
[00:51:22.272 --> 00:51:22.712]  The U.S.
[00:51:22.752 --> 00:51:29.894]  is in place, and the Marines have landed, and the Army is there, and more anti-missile defense systems are in place.
[00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:46.887]  We're going to be covering all that coming up and the move to take your guns, my guns, and take your phone calls straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen, on this live, unfiltered, uncensored transmission, the Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:47.347 --> 00:51:48.348]  Please spread the word.
[00:51:48.408 --> 00:51:49.809]  That's how we overpower the censors.
[00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:51.631]  You're not the tail.
[00:51:52.071 --> 00:51:52.752]  You're the dog.
[00:51:52.792 --> 00:51:53.873]  When you hunt, we win.
[00:51:54.513 --> 00:51:58.076]  Well, the news is blowing up in the Middle East and hitting Twitter here.
[00:51:58.116 --> 00:52:00.118]  The Dinosaur Media will be covering it in the next hour.
[00:52:02.554 --> 00:52:17.885]  Reporters are confirming clearly the heaviest bombardments of northern Gaza now entering into central Gaza and reportedly the Israeli tanks and other weapon systems are rolling forward right now into Gaza.
[00:52:20.327 --> 00:52:23.969]  And this is going to be extremely, extremely horrific to watch.
[00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:28.493]  Anybody that thinks this is fun or a good thing needs their head examined.
[00:52:29.827 --> 00:52:33.749]  Gaz is witnessing the heaviest bombardment on land, sea, and since the beginning of the war.
[00:52:33.769 --> 00:52:38.692]  We're going to be taking your calls and going over all of that as it unfolds.
[00:52:39.332 --> 00:52:42.694]  But let's talk about the main attack a few days ago.
[00:52:42.714 --> 00:52:49.257]  And the individual who is an Army sharpshooter and in the reserve.
[00:52:51.451 --> 00:52:55.733]  Reportedly, they're now saying he's guilty without him being convicted and he probably did it, I don't know.
[00:52:56.173 --> 00:53:00.955]  He was in a mental institution in the summer, reportedly saying he was gonna bomb and shoot up the local army base.
[00:53:01.436 --> 00:53:02.856]  Why the hell he was released, I don't know.
[00:53:02.936 --> 00:53:04.077]  It happens over and over again.
[00:53:05.194 --> 00:53:11.816]  And he was a big outdoorsman and hunter and a multi-generational, at least four-generation farmers in that area.
[00:53:11.836 --> 00:53:13.956]  Everybody knows their family, say he's really nice.
[00:53:13.996 --> 00:53:14.917]  His brother's really nice.
[00:53:14.937 --> 00:53:17.577]  His family, his extended family are very nice.
[00:53:18.438 --> 00:53:20.298]  And mental health issues is probably what it is.
[00:53:20.358 --> 00:53:23.459]  We don't know because media deceives so much.
[00:53:24.199 --> 00:53:26.460]  Plus, they're not omnipresent either, even when they're trying to deceive.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:31.381]  And his local neighbors and people that knew him said that he's an outdoorsman.
[00:53:32.132 --> 00:53:37.010]   kind of a mountain man and that they'll have big trouble finding him.
[00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:43.251]   And that is certainly the case. I've been to Maine and it is, I've been to that area
[00:53:43.251 --> 00:53:49.572]   near there and it is, it is mountainous and you can't even walk five feet, there's so many trees.
[00:53:49.572 --> 00:53:56.211]   So if you know the area, it's really hard to find, to find somebody, especially when they're
[00:53:56.211 --> 00:53:57.971]  militarily trained.
[00:53:58.199 --> 00:54:02.861]  If he wants to, he's going to be able to kill a lot of the police and military that come in to try to get him.
[00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:13.226]  So, the smart thing to do is just sit back and wait until he runs out of food, and until they get an all-points bulletin hit, and then try to apprehend him that way.
[00:54:13.266 --> 00:54:18.789]  So, I wouldn't want the job of anybody dealing with this guy, given what they say, he's done, he's done.
[00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:20.039]  Who knows?
[00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:22.520]  He could be dead somewhere and they're just saying he's the guy that did it.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.360]  They could put Photoshop up claiming it's him.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.840]  I mean, there's so much lying.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.141]  This government, the things they've done.
[00:54:28.661 --> 00:54:30.481]  It's very fair to say who knows what's real.
[00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.202]  But it very may well be true.
[00:54:33.222 --> 00:54:34.622]  There's a lot of mental illness out there.
[00:54:34.662 --> 00:54:40.263]  And as you hype up mass shootings, you promote them like they're an option to do when you're distressed and crazy.
[00:54:40.723 --> 00:54:42.003]  People will then go out and do this.
[00:54:42.284 --> 00:54:43.564]  It's called the copycat effect.
[00:54:43.624 --> 00:54:44.304]  It's not debated.
[00:54:44.904 --> 00:54:45.424]  It goes on.
[00:54:45.464 --> 00:54:47.265]  The more they hype mass shootings, the more we get them.
[00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:55.167]  Still, it's the rarest form of death other than just getting hit by a meteorite or getting killed by a grizzly bear or a great white shark.
[00:54:55.768 --> 00:55:00.109]  Whenever that happens, it gets a lot of coverage, but it's still a rare event.
[00:55:00.129 --> 00:55:16.676]   I mean, we're talking, if you pull out gang-related mass shootings where people go and think it's the rival gang and shoot 20, 30 people and kill four or five, If you take those out of the equation, less than 70 people a year, that's still way too many, are killed in these mass shootings.
[00:55:16.716 --> 00:55:27.943]   So the idea, out of a nation of 330 million citizens and 40 million illegal aliens, And mass shootings and death and carnage and dead babies every day on the southern border.
[00:55:28.903 --> 00:55:31.265]  Hundreds of thousands dead on the Mexico side in the last decade.
[00:55:31.625 --> 00:55:32.766]  That's just kept quiet.
[00:55:33.066 --> 00:55:39.490]  They don't make a big deal about that because it's so massive with a hundred thousand plus dead, like 120,000 dead last year of fentanyl.
[00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:41.671]  That's just who they confirmed were dying from fentanyl.
[00:55:41.691 --> 00:55:43.552]  Some estimates are as high as half a million.
[00:55:43.893 --> 00:55:46.134]  Oh, that's back burner because, you know, a pill killed you.
[00:55:47.799 --> 00:55:54.661]  But when it's 70-something getting killed by crazy people, and it's so senseless, like, why would you go in a bowling alley or a bar?
[00:55:55.521 --> 00:56:01.983]  Or if you're a white supremacist, go to a black grocery store where working-class black people are buying themselves groceries.
[00:56:02.003 --> 00:56:05.624]  You just start shooting them, or random black people running around killing white people.
[00:56:06.065 --> 00:56:08.745]  It's because there's crazy people out there.
[00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:10.706]  And that's why we've got guns.
[00:56:10.766 --> 00:56:13.127]  But here's the big takeaway from this.
[00:56:15.427 --> 00:56:20.407]   One guy that knows how to use a gun And they don't even know what state he's in.
[00:56:20.427 --> 00:56:23.588]  He may be in Canada, maybe in Massachusetts, maybe in Vermont.
[00:56:23.648 --> 00:56:24.248]  They don't know.
[00:56:24.308 --> 00:56:25.649]  I would guess he's around where he's from.
[00:56:25.669 --> 00:56:30.770]  I had to bet they'll probably catch him five miles from his house in like a month from now.
[00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:34.871]  Maybe tomorrow, but I would guess a month from now, they'll catch him within five miles of his house.
[00:56:34.911 --> 00:56:35.111]  Boom.
[00:56:35.491 --> 00:56:41.432]  Not an Alex Jones prediction, an Alex Jones guesstimation, an approximation.
[00:56:42.973 --> 00:56:45.873]  He'll be caught within a month, five miles from his farm.
[00:56:47.294 --> 00:56:47.814]  He's a farmer.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.601]  It's completely insane what they say is true.
[00:56:51.822 --> 00:57:04.128]  But the big takeaway is when you see Biden, or Swallowswell, or Schumer saying, there can't be an uprising against this government, we have nuclear weapons.
[00:57:04.168 --> 00:57:13.313]  Well, nuclear weapons destroy whole countries, whole infrastructures, whole militaries, so that a country can't fight a full-scale occupation.
[00:57:13.353 --> 00:57:14.754]  But look at Vietnam.
[00:57:15.214 --> 00:57:22.744]   If a minority of people are willing to fight, And are indigenous, and you can't tell who they are, they're not wearing uniforms.
[00:57:23.424 --> 00:57:30.168]  We put millions of troops over a decade, over 15 years, into Vietnam versus advisors when the French failed in Indochina.
[00:57:30.668 --> 00:57:34.910]  And we had to leave in 1975, hanging off the skids of Huey helicopters in Saigon.
[00:57:36.871 --> 00:57:51.575]   So imagine this all-powerful government, and all the SWAT teams, and all the King's horses, and all the King's men, and all the helicopters, and all the FLIR, and all of it, can't get one guy Who went and targeted totally innocent people.
[00:57:52.795 --> 00:58:08.942]  Imagine what would happen if not Hezbollah who's here or Hamas, that's a whole other issue, but if say a million of the tens of millions of veterans in this country decided to go out and target globalists and leftists and their supporters.
[00:58:11.983 --> 00:58:16.725]  If just each person went out and got one of them, and I'm not calling for this, I'm just pointing out their weakness.
[00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:18.518]  Don't do this.
[00:58:19.438 --> 00:58:29.961]  If just one person out of that million man, woman army went out and got one target, that'd be a million dead globalists and their minions, they'd be defeated like that.
[00:58:30.361 --> 00:58:33.281]  The problem is, that's conventional warfare.
[00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:37.082]  They will cyber cut the power off the minute that starts.
[00:58:37.122 --> 00:58:44.424]  That's the plan, and blame it on domestic groups that they've already floated that, oh, working with Russians, domestic groups are going to cut the power.
[00:58:47.915 --> 00:58:52.739]  They'd probably set off a nuke and claim that a foreign enemy did it, to then demonize the opposition.
[00:58:52.799 --> 00:59:07.131]  So, instead of assassinating them with guns, we have to, or hammers, you could have all the guns taken from me, and I'm not going to do this, I'm saying hypothetically, one ball-peen hammer, or one double-edged dagger.
[00:59:08.972 --> 00:59:13.196]  I can get all the guns and all the tanks and all the armored vehicles I'll ever want.
[00:59:15.216 --> 00:59:18.737]  Because I know how to walk up behind somebody and hit them in the back of the head.
[00:59:20.698 --> 00:59:21.498]  Now, I wouldn't do that.
[00:59:22.999 --> 00:59:24.359]  But it's the training that matters.
[00:59:24.379 --> 00:59:25.980]  You have to know how to use the guns.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.761]  You have to know how to clean the guns.
[00:59:28.781 --> 00:59:30.282]  You've got to know how to shoot the guns.
[00:59:30.722 --> 00:59:32.803]  And you've got to have the will to use the guns.
[00:59:33.763 --> 00:59:42.246]  But randomly blowing up a federal building, randomly going in and shooting up a bowling alley, randomly going into a bar is evil and wrong and bad.
[00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:48.666]   Now, the globalists Do force injections and roundups and all the things they're planning, that they can sell to the public.
[00:59:48.686 --> 00:59:51.809]  We were just putting a dress rehearsal on it the last three and a half years.
[00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.632]  I don't want this to happen, but that's where this is going to go.
[00:59:56.893 --> 01:00:01.416]  And so Swallow's Well saying, ha ha ha, we're going to take your guns, we're going to confiscate your guns.
[01:00:03.178 --> 01:00:06.661]  Because we've got nuclear weapons and we've got F, like you said, F-15s.
[01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:15.101]  F-15s is the height of delusional arrogance.
[01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:16.771]  And that's the thing I want to say about the globalists.
[01:00:17.412 --> 01:00:22.016]  They got the NSA, and they got big tech, and they've got unlimited fiat money.
[01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:32.886]  But when people identify them, like the Vietnamese did, whether they were good or not, Ho Chi Minh and the communists, and decide not to roll over, you cannot beat people.
[01:00:33.406 --> 01:00:37.430]  And so Zbigniew Brzezinski, before he died, was speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations branch of Canada.
[01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:39.571]  I haven't played this in years.
[01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:45.276]  Zbigniew Brzezinski says it's easier to kill a million people than to convince or control them.
[01:00:45.856 --> 01:00:47.017]  And that's official doctrine.
[01:00:48.058 --> 01:00:49.139]  And so how are they going to kill us?
[01:00:49.159 --> 01:00:58.928]  Well, they're going to give us GMO, they're going to radiate us, they're going to give us poison shots, they're going to target the hotlots and conservative Christian areas, they're going to hit some of their own people, their own minions, and they're going to get rid of them anyways too.
[01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:03.131]  So that's how they're killing us is by covert means.
[01:01:03.812 --> 01:01:08.339]   But don't be delusional and not understand That's indeed going on.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:31.504]  So, one guy that knows how to use a gun, and understands the landscape, that understands the topography, that understands the lay of the land, that understands the zone he's in, that understands the warfighting terrain, could potentially be out there for years.
[01:01:31.864 --> 01:01:34.905]  I don't think he'll last more than a month, because he's mentally ill.
[01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:37.246]  Maybe he's already committed suicide.
[01:01:37.286 --> 01:01:41.950]  Maybe they're going to find his, you know, rotting dead body or, you know, bears or something will eat it.
[01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:43.371]  Now, there it is.
[01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:48.094]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill one million people than to control one million people.
[01:01:48.134 --> 01:01:50.776]  Yeah, but I don't want to just show them a quote.
[01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:52.057]  Yeah, there he is.
[01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:56.661]  He said it a couple times, but that's on national TV.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:03.980]   where he really said it clearly was at a, it's like a big dark, it's a dark banquet
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:08.500]   room with them all around a big table and he's an elector and he says that that's the
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500]  video I'm looking for.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.179]  But I'll check it during the break.
[01:02:11.179 --> 01:02:14.740]   The point is I don't want to tell you something unless I show it to you.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.420]  So we're going to do that.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.080]  So it's a big deal.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.460]   But first, there's a bunch of these clubs and I'm not going to torture you listening
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:27.380]   to Kamala Harris or the press secretary's annoying idiotic voices, but I'm not going
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.380]  to torture you too much.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.380]  I'm going to play two clips.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:36.340]   Play Kamala Harris and then the press secretary saying we want the Australian plan to take
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.661]  all guns down to single shot, get a special license.
[01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:57.791]  In fact, I've had Craig Jones, an Australian, top grappler, friend of mine, lives here in Austin, and he talks about the fact that you'd have to go to a special gun place and the guns were chained down at the gun range and you couldn't even move them more than a few degrees.
[01:02:59.037 --> 01:03:05.123]  And then if you've got special licenses, maybe you can have a single-shot 12-gauge or a single-shot 22.
[01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:08.946]  And of course, it didn't cut the crime rate in Australia.
[01:03:09.907 --> 01:03:11.528]  And they took the guns the same way in New Zealand.
[01:03:11.548 --> 01:03:13.270]  So here's Kamala Harris saying that's the model.
[01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:18.174]  And then here's the press secretary saying we want to ban all the assault weapons.
[01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:26.347]   Well, their definition, and Biden's now said this too, of an assault weapon is anything that is not Basically single shot.
[01:03:26.827 --> 01:03:28.108]  Anything that's semi-automatic.
[01:03:28.168 --> 01:03:29.128]  Here are the clips.
[01:03:30.168 --> 01:03:39.051]  Gun violence has terrorized and traumatized so many of our communities in this country.
[01:03:40.011 --> 01:03:44.053]  And let us be clear, it does not have to be this way.
[01:03:45.353 --> 01:03:48.234]  As our friends in Australia have demonstrated.
[01:03:48.971 --> 01:03:50.512]  Time to find common ground.
[01:03:51.512 --> 01:03:55.915]  Let's work together to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
[01:03:56.295 --> 01:04:10.903]  Let's work together to enact universal background checks, require safe storage of guns, and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals who have no business being armed with a weapon of war.
[01:04:12.984 --> 01:04:24.840]   And importantly, we continue to urge all residents to heed The warnings and guidance of the local officials and federal law enforcement are on the ground to assist with the response.
[01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:32.447]  During the state dinner last night, the president was informed and stepped out to receive an initial briefing of the shooting.
[01:04:32.467 --> 01:04:33.768]  Okay, I can't listen anymore.
[01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:34.268]  Turn it off.
[01:04:35.749 --> 01:04:40.834]  These people have gotten almost half the attorney generals put in place by Soros.
[01:04:41.974 --> 01:04:46.197]  They control over 1,000 of the largest cities and towns, almost every one of them.
[01:04:46.217 --> 01:04:48.238]  I think it's like one or two they don't control, the top 1,000.
[01:04:48.478 --> 01:04:48.658]  Top 1,000!
[01:04:50.259 --> 01:04:51.100]  They're capturing us.
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:58.204]  And then I've seen cases in Austin and Fort Worth and Dallas and San Antonio and Houston just since Biden got in.
[01:04:58.224 --> 01:05:01.426]  And you're like, well, they already had their DAs in.
[01:05:01.466 --> 01:05:03.307]  Yeah, well, they got even more bold since that happened.
[01:05:04.428 --> 01:05:23.804]   Where, literally, As long as it's a black person and they shoot two or three people in the case of at a public school, and the guy was 16, they were white, they let him out the next day when he shot and wounded, thank God he didn't kill, three people in Fort Worth.
[01:05:23.824 --> 01:05:24.704]  I mean, that's an example.
[01:05:25.205 --> 01:05:36.169]  They let the guys in Austin out after a few days who shot over 20 bullets and hit a whole bunch of people on 6th Street.
[01:05:36.997 --> 01:05:37.957]  And they let him out of jail.
[01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:58.607]  So, now if you're white and you shoot somebody, even if it's in self-defense, like the army officer, who was an Uber driver on his part-time job, and the people came and aimed a gun at him, Antifa did, and he shot the guy, he's in prison right now.
[01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:09.326]   So, if you shoot a crowd of people or push a white woman in front of a bus, or a Subway, you get a slap on the wrist.
[01:06:10.147 --> 01:06:12.068]  Now, why would the DA's be doing that?
[01:06:12.108 --> 01:06:19.293]  Why would Leticia James, the Attorney General, say, you know, these evil, white, pasty people, they're the problem.
[01:06:19.814 --> 01:06:21.155]  I played the clip three times yesterday.
[01:06:21.855 --> 01:06:22.736]  You want to see it again?
[01:06:23.837 --> 01:06:24.757]  Guys, find it for me.
[01:06:25.158 --> 01:06:25.798]  Let's play it again.
[01:06:25.818 --> 01:06:29.921]  And we'll go to break, and I'm going to check the Brzezinski clips, and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:06:31.002 --> 01:06:33.844]  But that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:34.921 --> 01:06:40.226]  And again, we have to stand up and not hate people because of what color they are, because we're white.
[01:06:40.927 --> 01:06:49.014]  White people have to say, hey, I'm not going to be demonized and attacked and have you say it's open season on me anymore.
[01:06:50.616 --> 01:06:55.741]  And we need to have these DAs and Attorney Generals prosecuted.
[01:06:57.045 --> 01:07:02.049]  But we can't do that, and well actually a bunch of them are starting to get prosecuted, until we can control the Justice Department.
[01:07:02.509 --> 01:07:04.611]  And basically everything flows from that.
[01:07:05.372 --> 01:07:12.517]  Federal judges want to arrest three, four, five time convicted, arrested pedophiles in Texas.
[01:07:13.018 --> 01:07:14.839]  I've talked to the judges myself, I mean high level.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.862]  And they point me in the, you know, not the secret stuff, what's in the public domain.
[01:07:20.444 --> 01:07:30.262]   Where you have convicted pedophiles, convicted many times, Caught driving school buses for disabled children in Texas.
[01:07:30.322 --> 01:07:30.782]  Nothing's done.
[01:07:31.202 --> 01:07:33.684]  They try to get an authorization to indict him.
[01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:39.848]  Merrick Garland kills the indictment.
[01:07:41.249 --> 01:07:42.030]  And they're turned loose.
[01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:50.395]  And so the dregs, not all of them, but a lot of them, are being dumped on America.
[01:07:52.096 --> 01:08:01.596]   Cuban-Americans are great people, but when Castro in the early 80s Did the dumped out his prisons and dumped out all the resistance.
[01:08:02.296 --> 01:08:08.779]  A lot of really serious hombres came here and it was called the Cuban crime wave and the movie is a composite of true stories.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:16.363]  It's like historical fiction with the fictitious, but there were real guys was based on Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay for it.
[01:08:17.303 --> 01:08:20.365]  It's an excellent movie Scarface is like a true story folks.
[01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:23.852]  And of course, that's just Cubans wanting to sell drugs and make money.
[01:08:24.693 --> 01:08:26.654]  This is human trafficking.
[01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:30.836]  This is just over-the-top crime.
[01:08:33.578 --> 01:08:34.438]  Here's Leticia James.
[01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:43.079]   I stand up to an administration which is too male, too pale, and too stale.
[01:08:43.079 --> 01:08:51.079]  [Cheering]
[01:08:51.079 --> 01:08:54.079]  Too male, too pale, and too stale.
[01:08:54.414 --> 01:08:58.717]  Too male, too pale, and too stale!
[01:08:59.598 --> 01:09:03.440]  And we will not go away silently!
[01:09:04.961 --> 01:09:06.282]  We will not be silent!
[01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.245]  You don't see her moving to Rwanda or Somalia, though.
[01:09:10.945 --> 01:09:17.209]  She really wants to be around all these evil white devils and the Christian civilization that's been so successful.
[01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:20.492]  But she's just put there by Soros and the ADL.
[01:09:22.844 --> 01:09:25.305]  Well, they loot and rob and destroy the country.
[01:09:26.365 --> 01:09:31.946]  They just put a bunch of women and people, and I'm not saying there aren't women or black people that are competent.
[01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:32.286]  There are.
[01:09:32.646 --> 01:09:33.427]  They don't want them.
[01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:36.067]  They don't want anybody conservative or Christian.
[01:09:36.107 --> 01:09:40.048]  They put communist scum, like take Black Lives Matter.
[01:09:40.428 --> 01:09:41.228]  They've got their tenets.
[01:09:41.308 --> 01:09:44.769]  One of them is no nuclear family and transgender black men.
[01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:47.190]  Their main mission is to feminize black men.
[01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:50.773]  And sterilize them, literally, and not have a nuclear family.
[01:09:50.793 --> 01:09:53.436]  Well, what could you do worse to hurt the black family?
[01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:57.641]  Well, what the Democrats do with their great society and paying black women to kick men out of the house.
[01:09:59.183 --> 01:10:00.184]  Get a quote free check.
[01:10:01.145 --> 01:10:04.970]  Blacks had a lower illegitimacy rate than whites.
[01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:08.945]  Before that, and now they have the highest in the world, almost 80%.
[01:10:10.107 --> 01:10:11.288]  They knew directly what they were doing.
[01:10:12.329 --> 01:10:14.170]  And so this is just an extenuation of that.
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:23.639]  So while the globalists abort more than half the blacks and do all this stuff, and you know, Biden gives speeches about blacks are alpha predators and we need to put them all in prison.
[01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:25.960]  Then they go, oh, let's not try that now.
[01:10:26.321 --> 01:10:34.466]  Let's just tell black people it's open season on white people and put in Black Lives Matter and everybody, so they can then run around and loot and burn everything down.
[01:10:34.506 --> 01:10:38.269]  And when they do, Perth City will give them $25 million for the great job they did.
[01:10:40.070 --> 01:11:00.363]   Main mission, in the patriarchy, in the nuclear family, so it's a bunch of isolated, alone women, and then put up for the women who are all alone, crime-ridden, no man, no money, no nothing, Well, just put some black women in charge everywhere, at least on the surface, and some weird, whacked-out, crazy leftist judges.
[01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:04.286]  I mean, look who's running the D.C.
[01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.006]  court against Trump.
[01:11:07.588 --> 01:11:08.249]  What's the image?
[01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:09.450]  Oh, it's a black woman.
[01:11:09.289 --> 01:11:16.289]  and she's getting that evil white devil.
[01:11:16.289 --> 01:11:18.289]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:11:18.598 --> 01:11:20.139]  All right, we got loaded phone lines.
[01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:26.702]  Dean, Larry, Mark, Stephanie, Mark, Mary, Justin, Jordan, Hillary, Kim, and others.
[01:11:26.722 --> 01:11:33.465]  We're going to be taking your calls here today, and we're going to do it when we come back.
[01:11:33.505 --> 01:11:34.885]  We're not going to break here for a few minutes.
[01:11:36.566 --> 01:11:41.501]   And then I'm going to get into more Of the entire globalist plan is race-based control.
[01:11:42.002 --> 01:11:44.024]  And that's because 93% of the world's not white.
[01:11:44.624 --> 01:11:50.650]  And if you're BlackRock and Larry Fink and, you know, folks, you look at it and you say, well, the West is wide open.
[01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:52.171]  They're easily intimidated.
[01:11:52.191 --> 01:11:54.453]  You can guilt people in the West in anything.
[01:11:56.295 --> 01:12:27.677]   And so we'll just attach our whole New World Order, open border, global government, fentanyl, police state, social credit score system To that, and we'll have the corporate advertisers and the corporate spokespersons being black, and we'll put a black face on the New World Order, kind of like Obama was the beta test for, while they cut off resources to Africa and all the rest of it, accelerated abortion, and then we'll just move our whole agenda forward saying, if you don't support BlackRock having 88% of the world's wealth, well, you don't like black people.
[01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:32.679]  What in the world does black people have to do with Larry Fink and BlackRock and George Soros?
[01:12:32.759 --> 01:12:33.019]  Nothing.
[01:12:34.352 --> 01:12:36.252]  All the promises of reparations and all that stuff.
[01:12:36.773 --> 01:12:38.393]  Oh, that's how they're going to bring the social credit score in.
[01:12:38.793 --> 01:12:40.674]  Oh, black people get a discount.
[01:12:41.014 --> 01:12:42.134]  Well, how do they prove they are?
[01:12:42.194 --> 01:12:42.674]  How do they prove?
[01:12:42.954 --> 01:12:44.474]  Oh, there's a card you've got.
[01:12:44.995 --> 01:12:48.535]  And now the businesses have a database number for you where you get special treatment.
[01:12:48.956 --> 01:12:50.956]  And now they brought in a special treatment plan.
[01:12:51.216 --> 01:12:53.617]  And now they can, oh, you sterilize your child.
[01:12:53.697 --> 01:12:55.037]  You get a special treatment.
[01:12:55.457 --> 01:12:56.617]  Or you support world government.
[01:12:56.877 --> 01:12:58.498]  Or you went out and demonstrated to take guns.
[01:12:58.558 --> 01:12:59.998]  Or you voluntarily turn your guns in.
[01:13:00.398 --> 01:13:02.779]  You get discounts at all these stores.
[01:13:03.894 --> 01:13:07.797]  And now they can use it for full social engineering.
[01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:09.798]  That is the plan.
[01:13:09.878 --> 01:13:10.719]  It's been the plan.
[01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:12.320]  It's going to be that plan.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:22.487]  And if anybody thinks a free lunch the New World Order wants to give you isn't poisoned culturally, look at LBJ right after he had Kennedy killed.
[01:13:22.547 --> 01:13:23.448]  His letters are public.
[01:13:24.228 --> 01:13:26.390]  He said, we're going to put these N-words on welfare.
[01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:27.110]  We're going to control them.
[01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:28.311]  We're going to break their families up.
[01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:30.313]  We're going to get full control of their lives.
[01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:32.914]  And I'll have these N-words voting for us for 100 years.
[01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:36.219]  Real simple.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:49.709]  Put the black women on the government payroll, and then tell them no men in the house, and then have Hollywood and then the rap culture put out the image of black masculinity being a thug, being a pimp.
[01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:58.215]  And that didn't even, that was, that was as common in the white community as it was the black community.
[01:13:58.236 --> 01:13:59.396]  It was still rare until this.
[01:13:59.817 --> 01:14:01.198]  And they literally told you who you are.
[01:14:01.218 --> 01:14:04.100]  It's kind of like Biden saying, if you don't vote for me, you ain't black.
[01:14:05.947 --> 01:14:09.389]  This is a guy that said black people are inherently evil and predators.
[01:14:10.089 --> 01:14:14.071]  Now he's saying white people are inherently evil and predators because they're flipping the racial script.
[01:14:14.852 --> 01:14:16.933]  It's all corporately funded by the people that make the bombs.
[01:14:17.313 --> 01:14:18.153]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:21.095]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:14:21.135 --> 01:14:22.756]  The order they are received.
[01:14:22.796 --> 01:14:25.177]  Thanks for calling from California.
[01:14:25.197 --> 01:14:26.478]  Stephanie, you're on the air.
[01:14:26.498 --> 01:14:31.340]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:32.021]  I can, yes.
[01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:33.490]  Okay, great.
[01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:36.091]  I want to just touch on two very quick points.
[01:14:36.252 --> 01:14:51.559]  The first one is that digital currency of everyone's bank account will be digitized with a computer, and it's going to be ultimately be used to force shots on people, the deadly shots, because they'll just shut off your account if you cannot prove that you've been vaccinated.
[01:14:51.599 --> 01:14:53.260]  The second one is Ramaswami.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.561]  People call him Swami.
[01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:59.282]  I call him Swampy with a P. I do not believe this guy.
[01:14:59.643 --> 01:15:00.503]  He came on your show.
[01:15:02.512 --> 01:15:03.273]  Hey, do me a favor.
[01:15:03.473 --> 01:15:07.218]  Your phone sounded okay at first, then it got really shrill and weird.
[01:15:07.258 --> 01:15:09.201]  Can you back off of it or do something different?
[01:15:10.122 --> 01:15:11.164]  Okay, can you hear me better?
[01:15:11.304 --> 01:15:11.504]  Yes.
[01:15:12.577 --> 01:15:16.901]  Okay, so Ramaswamy, he was on your show yesterday.
[01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:21.605]  He called himself a George Washington patriot.
[01:15:22.766 --> 01:15:26.889]  So I call him Swamy with a P. I believe he's another swamp creature.
[01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:34.375]  I don't believe we should let him anywhere near a power position, at least for a decade, if we win 2024.
[01:15:35.756 --> 01:15:41.435]   As far as I know, he hasn't voted Republican until 2020, which is very suspicious.
[01:15:41.435 --> 01:15:45.035]  And also, he's a complete unknown.
[01:15:45.035 --> 01:15:49.235]   Why was he allowed on the Republican stage during the debate?
[01:15:49.235 --> 01:15:50.636]  That is virtually impossible.
[01:15:50.636 --> 01:15:58.635]   So I just wanted to touch on these two things, but why call was the illegal alien welfare?
[01:15:58.635 --> 01:16:02.795]   I'm calling on all Republican- Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:02.801 --> 01:16:05.364]  I just can't handle the phone quality.
[01:16:05.384 --> 01:16:06.805]  I appreciate your points.
[01:16:07.706 --> 01:16:09.207]  I don't think Ramaswamy's going to win.
[01:16:09.227 --> 01:16:13.311]  I think he's saying a lot of good things, like Elon Musk is.
[01:16:13.651 --> 01:16:15.052]  So I think trust would verify.
[01:16:16.133 --> 01:16:17.454]  So, I mean, RFK Jr.
[01:16:17.475 --> 01:16:18.375]  says a lot of good things.
[01:16:18.716 --> 01:16:20.257]  They killed his dad, they killed his uncle.
[01:16:20.337 --> 01:16:21.398]  I want to believe he's a good guy.
[01:16:21.418 --> 01:16:22.959]  I'm not going to be voting for him.
[01:16:24.361 --> 01:16:25.201]  I'm supporting Trump.
[01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:26.341]  Alex?
[01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:30.760]   And but I see RFK turning towards the left so he doesn't take votes from Trump as a third
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  party.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.760]  He takes from the left.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.081]   If he was turning towards the right wing now, I'd say, oh, he's really gunning for Trump.
[01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:37.081]  But I'm going to sit back.
[01:16:37.081 --> 01:16:39.501]  I'm going to watch what's happening.
[01:16:39.501 --> 01:16:41.401]  You can watch what's happening and we'll discuss it.
[01:16:41.401 --> 01:16:42.400]  We'll debate it.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.039]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:16:45.039 --> 01:16:46.039]  Mark in Oregon.
[01:16:46.039 --> 01:16:47.039]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:16:47.039 --> 01:16:48.039]  Alex.
[01:16:48.039 --> 01:16:49.039]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:58.161]   I'm calling regarding the bust of York, the black man that accompanied the Lewis Clark
[01:16:58.831 --> 01:17:17.175]  His bust in Mount Tabor has been, I guess, basically destroyed twice, which is emblematic of the larger, I guess you would call it, mental illness that now permeates our society.
[01:17:17.856 --> 01:17:33.000]  The people that are capable of doing these things, whether it's taking a statue of George Washington down, or York's statue, are... They're basically sleepwalkers, or zombies, I don't know what you want to call them.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:41.502]  They have some sort of induced mental state of... I don't know what to call it.
[01:17:41.522 --> 01:17:43.403]  They're, like I said, sleepwalkers.
[01:17:44.533 --> 01:18:02.083]   And again, it's emblematic of the direction we as a society, and now globally, are being directed so that they can basically, in effect, enslave us all in their Technocratic system.
[01:18:02.163 --> 01:18:02.643]  Absolutely.
[01:18:02.663 --> 01:18:04.504]  Well, the Robert E. Lee statue is a piece of history.
[01:18:04.544 --> 01:18:05.524]  It's incredibly valuable.
[01:18:05.925 --> 01:18:06.785]  It's now been destroyed.
[01:18:06.805 --> 01:18:09.947]  They're going to probably turn it into some giant abomination.
[01:18:10.547 --> 01:18:12.548]  But it was owned by the people that paid for it.
[01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:17.090]  Then it was given by the city to the, quote, black cultural museum secretly.
[01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:19.772]  So in a secret location, they could destroy it.
[01:18:21.092 --> 01:18:22.573]  It's just meant to inflame people.
[01:18:22.613 --> 01:18:23.994]  It's a raw exercise of power.
[01:18:25.274 --> 01:18:26.475]  I absolutely hear your point.
[01:18:28.112 --> 01:18:31.296]  Right, so they're pitting us against ourselves, basically.
[01:18:31.816 --> 01:18:38.804]  They're turning black people against themselves by deceiving them, and we're all being deceived.
[01:18:42.057 --> 01:18:43.238]  Of one basic race.
[01:18:43.278 --> 01:18:44.419]  We're a human race.
[01:18:44.699 --> 01:18:46.680]  Well, I agree with you, but let me boil down what it's really about.
[01:18:46.841 --> 01:18:50.984]  It's about the left having the power to ban anything, destroy anything they want.
[01:18:51.504 --> 01:18:58.970]  So they pick these iconic things, or they say two men can have a baby, or they can cut little boys' penises off, and all of that is about selling absolute madness.
[01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:00.250]  I'm going to continue, Mark.
[01:19:00.411 --> 01:19:04.730]   I'm gonna go to Justin and others here in a moment, but first, Paul Watson for Infowars.com
[01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:13.051]   just shot a little report dealing with this and he's absolutely right. This is a humiliation
[01:19:13.051 --> 01:19:17.770]   ritual. Here it is. It's not enough to just engage in brazen iconoclasm.
[01:19:17.989 --> 01:19:22.615]  The destruction of history must always be followed by a humiliation ritual.
[01:19:22.454 --> 01:19:23.255]  Case in point...
[01:19:23.255 --> 01:19:35.755]   *static* Charlottesville's Robert E. Lee statue meeting its demise
[01:19:35.755 --> 01:19:38.854]  in a 2250 degree furnace.
[01:19:38.944 --> 01:19:45.993]  The statue's defenders had tried to make sure it remained intact even if it was moved to the dark corner of some dusty museum.
[01:19:46.013 --> 01:19:52.477]   But Charlottesville's black hit The History Museum got ahead of the game by secretly destroying it in a nearby foundry.
[01:19:52.517 --> 01:20:01.481]  Jettisoning any concerns that this footage might further inflame tensions, the Washington Post thought it was very important to make sure as many people as possible saw it.
[01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:06.403]  Even when the Taliban and ISIS destroyed historical treasures, they only did it once.
[01:20:06.603 --> 01:20:14.506]   For our woke jihadists, the secondary act of desecration is in many ways more important Just to rub people's faces in it.
[01:20:14.526 --> 01:20:19.168]  It's both an overt projection of power and a subtle form of demoralization.
[01:20:19.228 --> 01:20:22.970]  The melted down statue will be turned into a new piece of public art.
[01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:24.690]  Hmm, can't wait to see what they come up with.
[01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:28.112]  People with no heroes and no accomplishments doing the only thing they know.
[01:20:28.232 --> 01:20:32.454]  Crying to the courts to allow them to turn beautiful things that other people made into garbage.
[01:20:32.474 --> 01:20:39.497]  But while these cultural Maoists are great at tearing things down, they're not so skilled at replacing them with anything worthwhile or positive.
[01:20:39.757 --> 01:20:42.781]  Take the park itself where the Robert E. Lee statue once stood.
[01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:48.247]  After its name was changed in true Maoist style from Lee Park to Market Street Park.
[01:20:48.287 --> 01:20:52.531]  The area is now one huge homeless encampment and dangerous drugs den.
[01:20:52.632 --> 01:20:58.478]  And what was once a pleasant stroll is now a treacherous minefield of vagrancy, degeneracy and violence.
[01:20:58.578 --> 01:21:00.981]  Progressivism chalks up another stunning victory.
[01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:04.883]  Charlottesville police are investigating a weekend stabbing in Market Street Park.
[01:21:05.183 --> 01:21:06.944]  They say it happened early Sunday morning.
[01:21:07.244 --> 01:21:10.646]  The victim is in stable condition and no arrests have been made.
[01:21:10.706 --> 01:21:14.869]  Yes, it may be a bit stabby, unsanitary and unsafe for your kids.
[01:21:14.929 --> 01:21:17.370]  But at least there's no statue to be offended by.
[01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:22.733]  But despite the statue's demise, some are hailing its meltdown as a kind of rallying cry.
[01:21:22.773 --> 01:21:24.514]  This would go hard as a profile pic.
[01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:26.195]  Statue face Chad.
[01:21:26.355 --> 01:21:29.817]  Maybe they should have just stuck it in the dark corner of the museum after all.
[01:21:31.817 --> 01:21:33.918]  Well that's right, this is going to backfire.
[01:21:33.938 --> 01:21:38.300]  I think I want to put a t-shirt out with Robert E. Lee and say, defend history.
[01:21:39.881 --> 01:21:42.462]  Because it's truly disgusting.
[01:21:43.562 --> 01:21:44.843]  And Elon Musk tweeted about it.
[01:21:48.243 --> 01:21:53.345]  Thad said, literally my ancestor, we carry the Lee name as first, middle, and my family.
[01:21:53.825 --> 01:22:06.310]  While I didn't need a directly insulting gesture to tell me that my kind is hated and may seek our extinction, the implicit cues were strong enough.
[01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:10.732]  I appreciate this image, making it absolutely clear.
[01:22:11.172 --> 01:22:15.094]  Elon Musk responded by saying, they absolutely want your extinction.
[01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:22.063]  Everybody wants to move here, but not for long, because all the blue cities have collapsed.
[01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:29.126]  And the Maoist, of course, tore down all the Confucian statues and other statues when they took over in 1949.
[01:22:29.566 --> 01:22:32.968]  In China, the Taliban does it.
[01:22:34.448 --> 01:22:35.509]  And here's the new modern art.
[01:22:35.529 --> 01:22:42.492]  I guess they'll turn it into a giant turd, because the CIA's been caught in their own documents wanting to kill all beautiful art.
[01:22:43.365 --> 01:22:48.710]  Depress the public and have you accept the collapse of civilization.
[01:22:50.191 --> 01:22:54.214]  Meanwhile, Biden's State Department blasted for celebrating intersex day.
[01:22:54.815 --> 01:23:00.580]  They already had LGBTQ plus P pedophilia S Satan time.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.145]  Now the Biden State Department has been slammed online after posting a statement celebrating intersex awareness day.
[01:23:07.746 --> 01:23:11.389]  Turns out every day is sex day.
[01:23:12.517 --> 01:23:15.722]  It's a sex cult, ladies and gentlemen, that's targeting our children.
[01:23:16.102 --> 01:23:21.950]  This in, before we go back to your calls, Israel, it appears, has massively intensified the bombardment and tanks are rolling forward.
[01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:24.254]  We don't know if this is another probing action or the full invasion.
[01:23:26.072 --> 01:23:31.338]  This is time for weapons, says member of the Hamas Political Bureau, Hassam Baran.
[01:23:31.818 --> 01:23:34.101]  Sends an urgent appeal to our people in the West Bank.
[01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:35.682]  This is the time for weapons.
[01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:38.305]  So they're trying to get an attack from the East.
[01:23:39.206 --> 01:23:41.269]  And we're off to the races.
[01:23:41.869 --> 01:23:43.471]  Let's go to Justin in Kansas.
[01:23:43.511 --> 01:23:45.093]  Justin, thank you for calling your own here.
[01:23:46.801 --> 01:23:49.544]  Alex, yeah, you know, it is a time for weapons.
[01:23:50.004 --> 01:23:52.747]  As a Christian, though, our weapon is the Word of God.
[01:23:52.787 --> 01:23:53.868]  We have the Sword of the Lord.
[01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:59.794]  And I want to petition every Christian out there with all the craziness that's going on in Israel and Palestine.
[01:24:00.415 --> 01:24:06.361]  One of the things that both of those people over there have in common is they have not accepted Christ as their Savior.
[01:24:06.381 --> 01:24:12.269]   So every Christian I'm telling you, you have been committed, the Ministry of Reconciliation.
[01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:15.252]  Our duty is to go out into the highways and hedges.
[01:24:15.312 --> 01:24:19.716]  We may not be able to go over to Israel or Palestine, but you can go in your backyards.
[01:24:19.776 --> 01:24:25.580]  I'm here in the Kansas City area, a city with a huge population, for instance, of Somali immigrants.
[01:24:26.021 --> 01:24:34.251]   And I'm here to tell you, you go to the housing projects of this city, and I'm sure of every city in this country, you can reach A Muslim for the Lord.
[01:24:34.691 --> 01:24:38.833]  You can reach an unbeliever from all over the world in this country.
[01:24:38.853 --> 01:24:39.794]  We have a great opportunity.
[01:24:39.814 --> 01:24:40.214]  No, you're right.
[01:24:40.234 --> 01:24:43.456]  The ultimate war is the info war, which is Jesus.
[01:24:44.116 --> 01:24:48.518]  And if you look at African countries, even subsectors that are Christian, they're prosperous and have low crime.
[01:24:48.858 --> 01:24:49.799]  Well, they don't have Christ.
[01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:51.000]  They're destroyed.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:52.420]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:56.422]  That's what we should be doing, is going out and reaching out to these people.
[01:24:56.462 --> 01:25:01.205]  Not with leftist racism and hate that the left's trying to permeate, but with love.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:09.143]  That's right, and speaking the truth in love, and you know, God's Word is the truth, the ultimate truth that we should be engaged in.
[01:25:09.223 --> 01:25:10.424]  All of these things are great.
[01:25:10.804 --> 01:25:19.269]  Be involved politically, but as a Christian, do not get so caught up in the things of this world that we don't have an eternal perspective on life.
[01:25:19.689 --> 01:25:31.836]  And we ought to, our main focus ought to be just that, to go and preach Jesus Christ and Him crucified to the lost people of this world, all over in our backyard, and everywhere else.
[01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:33.485]  Powerfully said.
[01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:39.107]  By the way, the Israeli government has now said that ground operations are intensifying.
[01:25:39.127 --> 01:25:39.948]  We'll put that back on screen.
[01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:41.849]  So it does look like they're starting it.
[01:25:41.889 --> 01:25:43.989]  Ground forces are expanding the ground activity this evening.
[01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:50.452]  Israeli Defense Force spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagarai said.
[01:25:50.752 --> 01:25:51.172]  All right.
[01:25:51.632 --> 01:25:53.353]  We'll track that as it unfolds.
[01:25:53.853 --> 01:25:55.154]  Truly a tragedy expanding.
[01:25:55.654 --> 01:25:57.314]  Dean in California, thanks for holding.
[01:25:57.334 --> 01:25:57.855]  You're on the air.
[01:25:57.875 --> 01:26:00.015]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:01.216 --> 01:26:01.456]  Go ahead.
[01:26:02.507 --> 01:26:08.532]  If there's one thing Republicans and Democrats agree on, it's endless funding and wars for Israel.
[01:26:09.152 --> 01:26:11.654]  And I wanted to talk about this clown Johnson.
[01:26:13.136 --> 01:26:15.297]  I don't know if you saw... You're talking about the new Speaker of the House.
[01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:18.640]  Yeah, we've got the clip saying he supports expanded war in Ukraine.
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:21.363]  Is that what you were going to get to?
[01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:26.447]  Not only that, he said his first and foremost priority is more aid and funding for Israel.
[01:26:27.731 --> 01:26:31.512]  And he said that the first bill he'd bring to the House floor would be for Israel.
[01:26:32.092 --> 01:26:38.534]  Yeah, well, nothing against Israel, but we got a hundred plus thousand fentanyl deaths and a totally collapsed southern border and mass sex slavery.
[01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:41.715]  I would think the integrity of our borders should be number one.
[01:26:42.816 --> 01:26:43.436]  Absolutely.
[01:26:43.776 --> 01:26:47.017]  I mean, does this guy represent Israelis or Americans?
[01:26:48.037 --> 01:26:52.039]  Well, that's why people get frustrated with Israel, even people that don't, you know, dislike Israel.
[01:26:52.859 --> 01:26:55.880]  Americans are tired of being third-class citizens.
[01:26:57.487 --> 01:27:00.509]  I mean, I think it's pretty clear who he works for.
[01:27:01.269 --> 01:27:03.791]  Also, the Senate just voted unanimously 97 to 0.
[01:27:04.751 --> 01:27:06.252]  You saw that?
[01:27:06.873 --> 01:27:09.314]  Yes.
[01:27:09.954 --> 01:27:22.822]  I mean, there's videos of Bibi Netanyahu and Donald Trump openly talking about how the Jewish lobby and the Israeli lobby totally own and control Congress.
[01:27:22.942 --> 01:27:24.683]  I mean, there's actually videos of you.
[01:27:25.785 --> 01:27:29.025]  Back in like 2003 talking about the same subject.
[01:27:29.636 --> 01:27:34.337]  Well, I think there's videos of me a couple days ago, you know, saying that Israel has undue influence.
[01:27:34.377 --> 01:27:36.217]  That means whoever controls Israel at the time does.
[01:27:36.237 --> 01:27:37.938]  I don't want foreign powers having that.
[01:27:38.618 --> 01:27:42.939]  The hat trick that people that obsess on Israel normally don't cover any other topic.
[01:27:42.959 --> 01:27:55.862]  I'm not talking about you, but the people I see out there in the talk, all they talk about is Israel, is if people say Jones never covers this, and then you show constant clips of me saying it online, but saying, oh look, we caught him here saying it on a show, like it's a secret show.
[01:27:56.282 --> 01:27:56.722]  But I don't...
[01:27:57.181 --> 01:28:02.702]   dislike Israel. Israel's going nowhere. I don't hate Jews in general, but I don't like, you know,
[01:28:02.702 --> 01:28:05.902]   British intelligence manipulating our internal stuff. I don't like Communist China doing it.
[01:28:05.902 --> 01:28:11.100]   I don't like Israel doing it. So, I mean, I know those clips. I put those clips out.
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:16.141]   So it's not like some secret thing somebody found. Did you see me with Nick Fuentes for
[01:28:16.141 --> 01:28:21.742]   almost two hours the other day? I listened to it. He's been vindicated.
[01:28:21.951 --> 01:28:26.513]  I mean, I don't really like the guy too much, but... I think Nick's interesting.
[01:28:26.573 --> 01:28:27.874]  I appreciate your call, man.
[01:28:28.194 --> 01:28:36.197]  I just... I don't want to be at war with Russia and Ukraine, and I don't want this war happening in the Middle East, and I've talked about it.
[01:28:36.217 --> 01:28:42.659]  It's pretty clear that whoever was running the government, whether it was a coup against Netanyahu to make him look bad or whether he did it, the Israeli government stood down.
[01:28:42.679 --> 01:28:43.059]  That's wrong.
[01:28:43.539 --> 01:28:45.320]  But killing those 1,300 Jews was wrong, too.
[01:28:46.476 --> 01:28:48.959]  A bunch of more liberal leftists that want a peace deal with Hamas.
[01:28:49.019 --> 01:28:52.423]  I mean, it's... I'm having an adult show here.
[01:28:53.704 --> 01:29:03.551]   I look at these other shows and they either worship Israel, like Ben Shapiro, or they sit there and literally blame Bad weather on Jews.
[01:29:03.711 --> 01:29:04.871]  And it just, it gets old.
[01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:06.912]  I mean, nothing against the Jews.
[01:29:06.932 --> 01:29:09.214]  I'm sorry, I just am not obsessed with Jews.
[01:29:09.894 --> 01:29:10.935]  Because it goes both ways.
[01:29:11.015 --> 01:29:14.576]  I mean, half these churches literally worship Israel.
[01:29:14.596 --> 01:29:17.598]  And I don't even know what Israel is or how Israel operates.
[01:29:18.018 --> 01:29:19.099]  Bunch of political factions.
[01:29:19.878 --> 01:29:29.706]  And then you got the other side that just literally talk about Israel 24-7 and believe if you attack Israel, that is the most moral thing in the world and the coolest thing.
[01:29:29.986 --> 01:29:31.627]  Just like the Palestinians and the left do.
[01:29:32.168 --> 01:29:34.330]  They're obsessed with bashing Jews in Israel.
[01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:37.132]  And they're attacking Jews all over the U.S.
[01:29:37.172 --> 01:29:40.174]  and blocking them into grocery stores and synagogues and everywhere.
[01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:41.495]  And the media is covering it up.
[01:29:41.515 --> 01:29:47.297]   I mean, imagine just randomly, oh, let me go to a Jewish grocery store And then let me just confront them because they're Jews.
[01:29:47.658 --> 01:29:51.160]  Half of them are probably liberals that support those idiot leftists.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.582]  It's like, it's more complex.
[01:29:55.183 --> 01:30:03.928]   And, you know, Nick Fuentes was on the Earlier show that day, the American Journal, it comes on 8 a.m.
[01:30:03.948 --> 01:30:05.909]  Central and Infowars.com.
[01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:11.653]  And he's like, Alex is, you know, not giving balanced coverage of this balanced coverage.
[01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:18.257]  I had him on the show and I looked at the stack of news I haven't had that day on Infowars, and it was mainly all critical of Israel.
[01:30:19.197 --> 01:30:21.198]  But I don't tell my crew, hey, go be critical Israel.
[01:30:21.699 --> 01:30:23.360]  Some days it looks like it's all for Israel.
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.401]  Some days it looks like it's a mix or the other way around.
[01:30:27.982 --> 01:30:29.183]  We're here just covering it.
[01:30:30.441 --> 01:30:32.442]  You know, Iran's saying they may attack Israel.
[01:30:32.482 --> 01:30:34.443]  I played the foreign minister, I said, that's a bad idea.
[01:30:35.684 --> 01:30:39.767]  And then yet, Yahoo says, we're good, they're able, we'll kill them all, let God's word out.
[01:30:40.167 --> 01:30:41.408]  I said, that sounds genocidal.
[01:30:42.788 --> 01:30:52.694]  So, I'm really, just as a man, as a father, as a Christian, like the last caller before last, like, hey, we should go out and reach out to the Muslims and proselytize them.
[01:30:53.315 --> 01:30:55.236]  Well, you can't do that in a Muslim country, you get killed.
[01:30:56.147 --> 01:31:00.049]  But you can't do that in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia.
[01:31:00.069 --> 01:31:07.134]  And that's why I'm critical of the leader of Scotland criticizing white people.
[01:31:07.874 --> 01:31:12.397]  Well, I mean, if you don't like a 95% white country, don't come there.
[01:31:12.437 --> 01:31:14.678]  I mean, where is it for the white people?
[01:31:15.619 --> 01:31:16.980]  We can't go to these places.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.861]  I mean, you try to go take over.
[01:31:18.901 --> 01:31:20.202]  You go to Africa and run for office.
[01:31:20.402 --> 01:31:20.902]  I'm white.
[01:31:20.962 --> 01:31:22.063]  I'm going to run for office.
[01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:23.023]  You're not black.
[01:31:23.063 --> 01:31:23.624]  You're not running.
[01:31:24.588 --> 01:31:38.073]  But so this hospitality that Europe has and all this, for people being brought in who are organized by the left to hate the country and to hate white people is a big deal.
[01:31:38.113 --> 01:31:49.097]  And I'm calling it out, I've been calling it out, but I'm more intensely calling it out because it's coming to a head and white guilt is then attached to all the globalist agenda and we go along with it and we need to stop doing it.
[01:31:49.997 --> 01:31:59.398]   And we need people that aren't white Particularly if you're a Christian, to see this, which they are, like Larry Elder and the list goes on and on.
[01:32:00.619 --> 01:32:02.600]  I mean, there's so many great people, Candace Owens.
[01:32:03.501 --> 01:32:05.022]  And so that's wrong, because it is wrong.
[01:32:06.803 --> 01:32:08.905]  I mean, if I saw people out running around the U.S.
[01:32:08.945 --> 01:32:14.850]  saying, being black is inherently evil, and blacks are inherently bad people, I'd say that's terrible to say that.
[01:32:16.032 --> 01:32:19.373]  But Joe Biden said it, Hillary Clinton said it, would you like to see the videos?
[01:32:20.033 --> 01:32:23.175]  And it's like, well, that's okay, because she promises us free stuff.
[01:32:24.755 --> 01:32:25.736]  Well, that's your master.
[01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:43.022]  Whether you're white or black or whatever you are, I mean, if somebody says you're a bad person and an animal, a predator, but they give you money so it's okay, and then they sick you on the people that say you're a human, they're trying to stop you killing your babies, are you becoming what they say you are?
[01:32:44.206 --> 01:32:46.729]  Because the animals I see are Hillary Clinton and George Soros.
[01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:51.273]  But George Soros told the LA Times he believes he's the Messiah.
[01:32:54.577 --> 01:32:56.278]  Mark in Georgia, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.962]  Hey Alex, God bless and protect you, brother.
[01:33:00.523 --> 01:33:00.843]  Thank you.
[01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:02.945]  Everybody at InfoWars.
[01:33:03.185 --> 01:33:07.550]  I just want to comment, you know, that video of Robert E. Lee's face.
[01:33:07.983 --> 01:33:14.722]   Melting away. Um, it just it choked me up so bad. I Thought it's so iconic because because they wanted him to
[01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:20.262]   command the north for those that don't know He was related to the one of the second command of George
[01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:24.882]   Washington his grandfather and he was so respected and you know the head of West Point
[01:33:24.882 --> 01:33:31.623]   all the rest of it and then He said this is wrong because you're double and triple taxing
[01:33:31.623 --> 01:33:34.681]   us. It wasn't about slavery and he said slavery was wrong, too
[01:33:34.922 --> 01:33:40.443]   But the whole point was he was such a good man. And yeah, it's so iconic that image of him
[01:33:40.443 --> 01:33:45.202]   Melting in that heat. It only made him bigger. Don't these communists get this is gonna backfire
[01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:51.802]   You know, by the way, the t-shirt thing you make it I'll buy it maybe with a quote from Orwell
[01:33:51.802 --> 01:33:56.283]   But I wanted to say that you know the night before he surrendered at Appomattox
[01:33:57.159 --> 01:33:59.700]  His commanders came to him and they said, look, we're surrounded.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:05.821]  We can disband the army and fade away into the hills.
[01:34:05.841 --> 01:34:10.082]  And we can fight and continue to fight as a guerrilla force.
[01:34:10.402 --> 01:34:12.562]  And Robert E. Lee had that choice.
[01:34:12.942 --> 01:34:15.703]  And he knew his men would run into cannon fire for him.
[01:34:16.263 --> 01:34:18.044]  He knew his word would go.
[01:34:18.464 --> 01:34:20.404]  And he said, no, we fought the fight.
[01:34:20.824 --> 01:34:21.584]  We lost.
[01:34:21.924 --> 01:34:23.605]  We have to be good citizens now.
[01:34:25.663 --> 01:34:26.464]  We're going to do that.
[01:34:26.864 --> 01:34:29.225]  And those men respected him to that point.
[01:34:29.245 --> 01:34:33.368]  And by the way, if the South would have done that, it would be in a 20-year civil war.
[01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:34.909]  Exactly.
[01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:42.293]  That war would have gone through to probably the early 1900s at the very least, and the country probably never would have recovered.
[01:34:42.553 --> 01:34:43.534]  Which was British intelligence's plan.
[01:34:46.081 --> 01:34:49.123]  I was born in Fort Benning, Georgia, which is now Fort Moore, Georgia.
[01:34:49.764 --> 01:35:03.733]  And no disrespect to General Moore, he's a hell of a soldier, but it was done as a cheap politician's trick to kowtow and bend the knee to the black caucuses and those that want our history erased.
[01:35:04.837 --> 01:35:13.370]  And I, you know, I have Confederates going back in my family and none of them own slaves because, well, they were about a step up from a slave.
[01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:17.075]  So I get so tired of that, hearing that all the time.
[01:35:17.476 --> 01:35:20.320]  I literally have a rebel flag tattooed on my chest.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.281]  Brother, I'll tell you what it's about.
[01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:23.021]  It's the battle flag.
[01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:29.084]  What it's about is, once they can take those symbols, they want the left, it's the ADL runs it.
[01:35:29.104 --> 01:35:34.647]  Let's be clear, they run the Southern Property Law Center, they run the NAACP, so don't blame the black people.
[01:35:34.787 --> 01:35:43.771]  It's the ADL, they call the shots, and once they can ban, did you know they're getting ready to pull down the George Washington statue in New York?
[01:35:44.727 --> 01:35:46.608]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:49.690]  It's about targeting the country and saying it was bad from the start.
[01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:58.956]  When we were a country that said it was wrong, and it started a process to end what we were doing, and the British, to their thing, ended slavery all over the world, except a few African and Muslim countries.
[01:35:59.316 --> 01:36:01.377]  White people ended slavery worldwide.
[01:36:02.578 --> 01:36:05.340]  And I'm sick of hearing... I'm not going to sit here and take it.
[01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.582]  My wife asked me why I collect all these books.
[01:36:09.622 --> 01:36:10.303]  I'm a history guy.
[01:36:11.094 --> 01:36:19.201]  And I have a lot of books about the Confederacy, very rare books, and I said because one day I'm afraid somebody's going to show up and they're going to burn them.
[01:36:19.642 --> 01:36:21.083]  That's why I worry.
[01:36:21.583 --> 01:36:23.825]  And all I can say is keep up the fight, brother.
[01:36:24.246 --> 01:36:27.268]  If you'll make this shirt, you'll at least sell one to me.
[01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.770]  God love you.
[01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:29.810]  God love you, brother.
[01:36:30.591 --> 01:36:37.899]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, look, They're taking America's images away and they're taking your freedom and your prosperity.
[01:36:37.939 --> 01:36:39.540]  Notice, it's like magic.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:44.503]  They take down Robert E. Lee and the whole city collapses.
[01:36:44.523 --> 01:36:47.544]  I mean, because it's the same groups, folks.
[01:36:48.305 --> 01:36:50.126]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:36:50.146 --> 01:36:53.708]  They're not just taking down Robert E. Lee or George Washington.
[01:36:54.448 --> 01:36:58.030]  Teddy Roosevelt was a huge advocate for civil rights.
[01:36:59.291 --> 01:37:00.511]  He was pro-black.
[01:37:00.872 --> 01:37:03.113]  They took his statue down in New York because he's white.
[01:37:04.397 --> 01:37:05.279]  Teddy Roosevelt!
[01:37:05.699 --> 01:37:06.120]  Pull it up!
[01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:08.003]  New York removes Teddy Roosevelt statue.
[01:37:09.065 --> 01:37:11.890]  Out front the Natural History Museum or library or whatever it was.
[01:37:12.852 --> 01:37:15.276]  I mean, folks, you heard Letitia James.
[01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:16.859]  We don't need anything white.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.401]  And it's the ADL working through these groups that literally wants to bully and intimidate.
[01:37:23.721 --> 01:37:29.723]  The ADL's curriculum is in all the major public schools, teaching white children they are inherently bad because of what color they are.
[01:37:30.023 --> 01:37:32.584]  That is a 180-degree shot.
[01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:34.404]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:37:34.444 --> 01:37:35.264]  said what Christ said.
[01:37:35.745 --> 01:37:36.805]  We're all God's children.
[01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:39.666]  Judge people what they do, what they stand for, what they produce, and treat us right.
[01:37:39.926 --> 01:37:40.706]  So here's Martin.
[01:37:42.017 --> 01:37:44.318]  Luther King Jr.
[01:37:45.318 --> 01:37:47.639]  and here is the ADL.
[01:37:48.139 --> 01:37:49.180]  It's what color you are.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.560]  It's what group you are.
[01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:52.401]  Here's the NAACP.
[01:37:54.282 --> 01:37:55.282]  They are the opposite.
[01:37:55.863 --> 01:38:01.685]  They are a 180 different from Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:38:02.945 --> 01:38:04.206]  By the way, Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:38:04.246 --> 01:38:05.747]  quote, never talked about transgenderism.
[01:38:06.027 --> 01:38:07.827]  They pulled his statues down at a bunch of universities.
[01:38:08.228 --> 01:38:09.828]  Transgenderism didn't exist then.
[01:38:10.408 --> 01:38:11.469]  They want to get rid of him too.
[01:38:12.765 --> 01:38:14.346]  Yeah, they're gonna get rid of everything, folks.
[01:38:14.726 --> 01:38:15.307]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:16.807 --> 01:38:19.409]  America is having its history, its culture stolen.
[01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:21.110]  That means all Americans.
[01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:23.051]  By the globalists.
[01:38:23.111 --> 01:38:27.313]  And here's the article, Roosevelt statue to be removed from Museum of National History.
[01:38:27.834 --> 01:38:28.674]  And they did remove it.
[01:38:31.176 --> 01:38:31.816]  They pulled it down.
[01:38:32.837 --> 01:38:34.257]  Overhead shot, or show me article.
[01:38:35.158 --> 01:38:35.698]  Him on a horse.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.600]  Because he's a white man.
[01:38:42.672 --> 01:38:47.876]  All white people, except for the ADL, are back.
[01:38:49.837 --> 01:38:58.363]  And I don't think anybody who really is thinking, no matter what color you are, whether you're Jewish or Christian or Muslim or Hindu, really thinks that's a good idea.
[01:38:58.383 --> 01:39:05.748]  And, again, I'm not sitting here in a position like white people get ahead if we disadvantage other people.
[01:39:07.249 --> 01:39:09.091]  You look at the lithium mines in the Congo.
[01:39:11.972 --> 01:39:21.198]  And how destructive the big corporations are for the cobalt and the rest of it, for the batteries, these toxic electric cars.
[01:39:23.719 --> 01:39:27.982]  And you see the incredible slavery going on, and your heart goes out to those children.
[01:39:28.682 --> 01:39:39.488]  And I think about 50 plus percent of black children never being born, being aborted, just because they brainwashed a lot of black people and turned them into servants of the new world order, doesn't mean even a large minority are like that.
[01:39:39.528 --> 01:39:40.409]  Well, why should we kill them?
[01:39:41.653 --> 01:39:59.726]  So while the globalists are killing brown people all over the world, they also now claim they represent you and speak for you because white people on average are Christian and conservative and have a conscience and feel bad, so they can then attach that conscience to the globalist agenda and get us to do whatever the New World Order says.
[01:40:01.167 --> 01:40:02.188]  And the globalists know that.
[01:40:04.169 --> 01:40:13.245]   It's cold-blooded, so stop letting the worst warmongers, the most corrupt organizations, The Democratic Party, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, all of them.
[01:40:13.705 --> 01:40:16.368]  Stop letting them dictate who's good and who's bad.
[01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:19.872]  But I'll tell you the real problem.
[01:40:19.932 --> 01:40:29.802]  It's white people who get into being priests of this political correctness and go around as the white saviors pushing all of this Lepus agenda.
[01:40:31.032 --> 01:40:32.313]  They're the professors teaching it.
[01:40:32.333 --> 01:40:33.573]  They're the academics pushing it.
[01:40:34.114 --> 01:40:37.696]  They're the corporate chiefs and all the big banks and media pushing it.
[01:40:37.996 --> 01:40:40.357]  And they're the ones doing it as a strategy of control.
[01:40:40.858 --> 01:40:42.859]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:40:42.959 --> 01:40:44.240]  Patronizing people.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.081]  Not patronizing them.
[01:40:46.101 --> 01:40:46.701]  Not supporting them.
[01:40:46.961 --> 01:40:47.642]  Patronizing.
[01:40:48.302 --> 01:40:49.783]  Patronizing means you support somebody.
[01:40:49.803 --> 01:40:50.563]  You go to their restaurant.
[01:40:50.583 --> 01:40:51.304]  You go to their store.
[01:40:51.704 --> 01:40:52.424]  You go to their church.
[01:40:52.484 --> 01:40:53.225]  You support them.
[01:40:53.245 --> 01:40:54.025]  You have them over for dinner.
[01:40:55.446 --> 01:40:57.407]  That's patronizing.
[01:40:57.766 --> 01:41:09.266]   patronizing is acting like you're for somebody when you're not.
[01:41:09.266 --> 01:41:18.166]   And so everybody has to have enough respect for themselves to stop letting people push us around the basis of race.
[01:41:18.166 --> 01:41:22.166]  Again, everybody knows this. I've said it 100 times.
[01:41:22.166 --> 01:41:24.766]  I like Jimi Hendrix. I listen to his music. I like it.
[01:41:24.766 --> 01:41:26.766]  I think it's powerful.
[01:41:27.455 --> 01:41:28.015]  Touches me.
[01:41:28.855 --> 01:41:30.236]  I don't think, oh, that's a black guy.
[01:41:30.396 --> 01:41:31.216]  I like a black guy.
[01:41:31.236 --> 01:41:32.236]  I think I like that music.
[01:41:32.876 --> 01:41:35.697]  I don't listen to Beethoven and say, oh, I'm, I love the Germans.
[01:41:36.237 --> 01:41:36.777]  He's German.
[01:41:37.098 --> 01:41:38.038]  I think that's powerful.
[01:41:38.078 --> 01:41:38.898]  That's a great brain.
[01:41:39.398 --> 01:41:40.058]  That moves me.
[01:41:41.139 --> 01:41:49.761]  I don't think about when I pull into some mom and pop Chinese food restaurant, I'm going to patronize Chinese people or I'm going to patronize them even.
[01:41:50.621 --> 01:42:02.651]   I like the food and That's what Martin Luther King talked about, is you judge people off of what they produce and what they do.
[01:42:04.872 --> 01:42:12.616]  And we all stand for the fruits of what is produced, and we go off what is the end product of this thing.
[01:42:13.016 --> 01:42:14.037]  Like, do I take this medicine?
[01:42:14.057 --> 01:42:15.257]  Does it make me better or make me worse?
[01:42:16.078 --> 01:42:17.118]  It's proofs in the pudding.
[01:42:17.658 --> 01:42:18.599]  The left doesn't want that.
[01:42:18.619 --> 01:42:21.260]  They want you to go off a surface that they control.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.901]  They want to enslave us, and they're doing a pretty good job at it.
[01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:25.082]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:25.102 --> 01:42:25.462]  Stay with us.
[01:42:26.618 --> 01:42:28.899]  Greg Reese has filed a new very important report.
[01:42:28.919 --> 01:42:30.279]  I'm going to play it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:42:30.359 --> 01:42:32.139]  Biblical views about the end times.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.580]  Very interesting perspective.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.561]  We're continuing in this third hour with your calls.
[01:42:38.581 --> 01:42:40.481]  I've got a lot of news I haven't hit.
[01:42:41.502 --> 01:42:42.802]  We're going to be getting to, though.
[01:42:45.083 --> 01:42:48.543]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:42:48.643 --> 01:42:50.284]  Kim in Florida, thank you for calling.
[01:42:50.304 --> 01:42:50.664]  Go ahead.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:59.263]  Hi Alex, I wanted to talk to you about an experience I had early this week at a major chain pharmacy.
[01:43:00.364 --> 01:43:05.826]  It seems to be in this part of northern Florida we're having a little bit of an antibiotic shortage.
[01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:18.112]  A lot of people in front of me in line at the drive-thru were complaining that their antibiotics are not working and they were there for their second try prescription.
[01:43:18.132 --> 01:43:25.813]   I'm also in that same boat I'm on my third prescription of antibiotics that are ineffective.
[01:43:25.833 --> 01:43:29.616]  So... How do you know you don't have a viral infection?
[01:43:30.776 --> 01:43:37.521]  You know, I have a bacterial infection because I can see that it's green on my skin.
[01:43:37.682 --> 01:43:39.123]  I have actually... I believe you.
[01:43:39.143 --> 01:43:40.283]  That's what I was asking.
[01:43:41.328 --> 01:43:43.009]  The antibiotics are stopping to work.
[01:43:43.429 --> 01:43:44.991]  They're trying to block the therapeutics.
[01:43:45.571 --> 01:43:52.756]  They've released a prion infection via the COVID shots that's similar to what causes Mad Cow Disease, spongiform encephalopathy.
[01:43:53.536 --> 01:44:00.421]  And so yeah, and then there's all sorts of shortages of drugs across the board because we're collapsing into a third world nation.
[01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:02.763]  There's plenty of money, but not enough resources.
[01:44:03.857 --> 01:44:06.280]  And I'd like to mention something else.
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:14.568]  I found in my own medicine cabinet some expired medication from a trip I took.
[01:44:14.608 --> 01:44:15.369]  Let's say that.
[01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:20.294]  And it's been more effective than anything I've gotten fresh from the pharmacy.
[01:44:20.334 --> 01:44:23.737]  So you went to Mexico and had like a couple year old bottle of stuff and it's working?
[01:44:24.698 --> 01:44:25.019]  Amen.
[01:44:27.302 --> 01:44:31.344]  I think that everyone should really hold on to what they have when they do their spring cleaning.
[01:44:31.364 --> 01:44:33.144]  No, but you just said it.
[01:44:33.164 --> 01:44:33.764]  You just said it.
[01:44:34.285 --> 01:44:45.329]  Almost no egg I buy, except for the ones we get from a local Mennonite community that we've got in the refrigerator right now that I got, almost none of them are vibrant or big or taste right.
[01:44:45.689 --> 01:44:49.951]  And they now admit the three big manufacturers of chicken feed have adulterated it.
[01:44:50.411 --> 01:44:52.752]  So yeah, the decision's been made by the big corporations.
[01:44:52.772 --> 01:44:54.492]  Hey, they got away with giving us poison shots.
[01:44:55.052 --> 01:44:56.313]  Why not just screw everybody?
[01:44:57.239 --> 01:45:04.865]  And yeah, now the FDA's announcing they're going to pull all these different drugs claiming that this antihistamine in them doesn't work.
[01:45:05.305 --> 01:45:09.348]  Well, I know that antihistamine works because I've taken it and it immediately gives me relief.
[01:45:09.388 --> 01:45:19.135]  So, they're going after drugs that work, and I'm not saying Tylenol's perfect, but it's got as a side drug, and the Tylenol flu severe, it's not the Tylenol drug that actually does it.
[01:45:19.155 --> 01:45:22.177]  But yeah, they are pulling the drugs that work and giving us pure crap.
[01:45:22.197 --> 01:45:22.738]  We're under attack.
[01:45:23.692 --> 01:45:28.974]  Now is the time to stock up your family's medicine cabinet now.
[01:45:29.174 --> 01:45:31.154]  And you have wonderful products, Alex.
[01:45:31.274 --> 01:45:38.657]  I'd like to give a shout out to your products, especially all the vitamins and minerals to protect yourself during the upcoming season.
[01:45:38.677 --> 01:45:47.419]  With these antibiotics being ineffective, I really want people to reach out, not only to support you, but of course to support you, but to protect their families.
[01:45:47.479 --> 01:45:49.180]  And I want to say one thing to you, Alex.
[01:45:49.924 --> 01:45:51.785]  I am supremely proud of you.
[01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:57.847]  So proud of you for embracing the Holy Ghost and putting him first and foremost on your microphone.
[01:45:58.507 --> 01:46:12.092]  It is so important in times like this and I hope everybody sends Owen a Thanksgiving card and a Christmas card and I hope everyone pays for InfoWars as much as they can and really supports you guys financially.
[01:46:13.047 --> 01:46:19.970]  And I just, I love you guys, and this is the first time I've ever called in, but I've been listening for years.
[01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:25.332]  And I just, I pray for you that the Holy Ghost will hold your hand and light your heart ablaze.
[01:46:26.433 --> 01:46:27.373]  Well, I appreciate you.
[01:46:27.413 --> 01:46:28.414]  Thank you so much, Kim.
[01:46:28.634 --> 01:46:29.374]  But I want to be clear.
[01:46:30.735 --> 01:46:39.919]  I'm not putting the Holy Ghost up front as some political decision or something that I even thought about.
[01:46:41.388 --> 01:46:46.192]  It's that I've been a Christian, you know, born again since I was like 10 at least.
[01:46:46.212 --> 01:46:48.594]  I mean, I was Christian before that, but I had the Holy Ghost experience.
[01:46:49.114 --> 01:46:53.858]  Then I kind of backslid, became a little bit evil in my early teens, 13, 14, 15.
[01:46:54.799 --> 01:46:59.322]  Got tempted, did become an outright Satanist, but I was definitely channeling dark forces.
[01:47:00.383 --> 01:47:07.088]  And then I repented out of that, 17, 18, 19, and then got my mission from God by the time I was 20.
[01:47:08.422 --> 01:47:11.223]  And completely turned from, you know, evil things I was doing.
[01:47:11.243 --> 01:47:14.024]  It wasn't like drugs and stuff, but it was women.
[01:47:15.265 --> 01:47:21.767]  And I talk about the Holy Ghost and God constantly because that's why I'm still on air.
[01:47:22.607 --> 01:47:26.449]  That's me clinging to that and getting my power from it.
[01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:28.759]  So that's the only reason I'm here.
[01:47:28.799 --> 01:47:30.099]  It's not like it's even a question.
[01:47:30.419 --> 01:47:35.342]  You don't take on Satan in the New World Order without God's backing and then God working through you.
[01:47:35.402 --> 01:47:46.526]  So it's God backing me through the broadcast and through what I say and do and inspiring me, giving me discernment and leading and guiding and directing me, and then God doing that with you that brings us together.
[01:47:47.247 --> 01:47:47.807]  So let's be 100% clear.
[01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:55.627]   a hundred percent clear. One hundred percent clear. I was always talking about God.
[01:47:55.674 --> 01:47:56.414]  I've been on air 29 years.
[01:47:57.394 --> 01:48:04.497]  But, as the evil rises, God lifts up a standard against it.
[01:48:04.577 --> 01:48:07.398]  So, that's why I talk about God more than ever.
[01:48:07.939 --> 01:48:09.679]  Some people get turned off, some people tune out.
[01:48:09.719 --> 01:48:11.160]  I get to, I see the emails, the comments.
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:13.401]  Man, this guy talks about God constantly.
[01:48:13.441 --> 01:48:23.745]  Well, I mean, when open Satanism's going on, and open government-run child trafficking of 400,000 children, and the Senate's having hearings, and they're not denying it, 400,000 kids that Biden disappeared?
[01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:28.372]  Just gave to whoever, 89,000, I don't even know where they are.
[01:48:29.213 --> 01:48:30.193]  That's the ones they tracked.
[01:48:31.874 --> 01:48:37.297]  And mainstream media is promoting pedophilia and there's just Satanism everywhere.
[01:48:37.777 --> 01:48:42.899]  I mean, like I told you, my wife's dad, four or five months ago, he's gotten better, thank God for prayer, had a heart attack.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.263]  They thought he might die, so we run up to Omaha, Nebraska, and I'm just at a regular hotel, just on a side street off downtown.
[01:48:52.773 --> 01:48:54.174]  Because he lives in the older part of the city.
[01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:54.915]  They've been there forever.
[01:48:55.655 --> 01:48:57.797]  German immigrants, you know, 150 years ago.
[01:48:57.817 --> 01:49:03.241]  And I'm getting out of the car, and I go, what's that parade?
[01:49:03.261 --> 01:49:08.104]  So I walk over, and it's an LGBT PS meeting.
[01:49:08.345 --> 01:49:12.227]  And then literally, a bunch of them had shirts with devils on it saying Satan.
[01:49:12.868 --> 01:49:14.789]  And then I went, wait, that's a Target shirt.
[01:49:14.889 --> 01:49:18.172]  One guy was on the elevator later, I guess, from the event.
[01:49:18.212 --> 01:49:19.233]  He saw me and all got freaked out.
[01:49:19.253 --> 01:49:21.675]  I went, well, I looked at the shirt, and it said Pride Month.
[01:49:22.506 --> 01:49:24.728]  But Pride Month says demon in the middle.
[01:49:25.208 --> 01:49:27.450]  So that was, that was lit up in the middle.
[01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:28.191]  So it's a demon.
[01:49:28.731 --> 01:49:30.092]  And it was a devil with a baby.
[01:49:30.112 --> 01:49:31.233]  I took a photo.
[01:49:31.253 --> 01:49:31.674]  We showed it.
[01:49:31.714 --> 01:49:32.154]  I sent it to you.
[01:49:32.194 --> 01:49:34.616]  It's in my camera roll, but I don't know if you guys can find it on short notice.
[01:49:35.337 --> 01:49:36.458]  I was like, oh, that's a Target shirt.
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:42.623]  And when I saw the crowd, like some had horns on and stuff.
[01:49:43.363 --> 01:49:43.764]  And I get it.
[01:49:43.784 --> 01:49:45.265]  Oh, we're triggering the Christians.
[01:49:45.305 --> 01:49:45.826]  Ha ha ha.
[01:49:46.206 --> 01:49:46.626]  No, man.
[01:49:48.768 --> 01:49:49.929]  They mean it.
[01:49:53.072 --> 01:50:01.657]  And again, I'm not judging people.
[01:50:04.999 --> 01:50:11.704]  But then when they're able to attach their adult sexual orientation to now other things, it's pedophilia, it's Satanism.
[01:50:12.264 --> 01:50:13.545]  Yeah, that's one of the shirts I saw.
[01:50:13.685 --> 01:50:14.045]  There it is.
[01:50:14.365 --> 01:50:15.106]  That's sold in Target.
[01:50:16.105 --> 01:50:17.545]  but this one's a different variant.
[01:50:17.545 --> 01:50:28.666]   And this is just a regular run-of-the-mill hotel, and then we go to the restaurant that night,
[01:50:28.666 --> 01:50:33.865]   that's also a bar, and I'm in there, and I'm like, my wife's like, "Those are hookers."
[01:50:33.865 --> 01:50:38.265]   And I'm like, "Yeah, but you see the pimp there with the girls and the guys, and they leave,
[01:50:38.265 --> 01:50:44.025]   and more whores come in?" And all I was saying is, it's like LA, okay, don't, I don't mean to
[01:50:44.025 --> 01:50:48.184]   prostitutes or whatever. It's a terrible position they're in but...
[01:50:48.311 --> 01:50:48.891]  Now L.A.
[01:50:48.951 --> 01:50:53.672]  is just overrun, just like broad daylight in front of schools, just hookers like naked on the streets everywhere.
[01:50:54.033 --> 01:50:55.413]  We're collapsing, folks.
[01:50:55.793 --> 01:50:59.534]  This isn't a civilization that is going to be able to continue on.
[01:51:02.375 --> 01:51:03.575]  And so that's all I'm saying.
[01:51:04.595 --> 01:51:07.856]  And man, I can flip a switch and have been like, hey, hookers, let's go.
[01:51:07.876 --> 01:51:10.257]  I mean, it's not like, oh, hookers, I'm scared.
[01:51:11.448 --> 01:51:18.833]  My point is, is that I understand what it means to children and the future and life and these women being exploited like this.
[01:51:21.615 --> 01:51:23.956]  And where that leads on average.
[01:51:24.516 --> 01:51:26.658]  And again, I'm not saying persecute a woman that does that.
[01:51:27.218 --> 01:51:28.259]  No, I don't believe in that either.
[01:51:28.339 --> 01:51:31.581]  I'm saying, though, I can say it's prolific.
[01:51:32.041 --> 01:51:40.647]  They teach in public schools now, we've covered it hundreds of times, where they in career day in public schools, they teach sixth grade girls that they could be a hooker.
[01:51:42.142 --> 01:51:46.425]  We had people when I was down at the River Church with Pastor Rodney who got up and cried.
[01:51:46.445 --> 01:51:47.506]  It was a beautiful young woman.
[01:51:47.947 --> 01:51:53.691]  She said, I was going to college up in wherever, and most of my friends became transgender and are now sex workers.
[01:51:53.751 --> 01:51:57.274]  I mean, that's what we produce, is sex workers?
[01:51:58.435 --> 01:52:07.302]  So outside's a gay pride parade, inside are... I was just talking to Scott, our lead producer, during the break, and I'm gonna go back to your calls here on the Alex Jones Show, on this live Friday edition.
[01:52:07.923 --> 01:52:09.384]  You made a great point about dehumanization.
[01:52:10.655 --> 01:52:11.856]  Oh, you know, humans are bad.
[01:52:11.876 --> 01:52:12.676]  We're bad for the environment.
[01:52:12.716 --> 01:52:13.296]  Babies are bad.
[01:52:13.336 --> 01:52:13.757]  Abort them.
[01:52:14.157 --> 01:52:14.737]  Save the Earth.
[01:52:14.777 --> 01:52:15.377]  Kill our cows.
[01:52:15.397 --> 01:52:15.998]  We're bad for the Earth.
[01:52:16.018 --> 01:52:16.638]  Cut down the trees.
[01:52:16.658 --> 01:52:17.298]  We're bad for the Earth.
[01:52:18.619 --> 01:52:19.439]  They're training you.
[01:52:19.539 --> 01:52:20.460]  Oh, white people are bad.
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:21.420]  They deserve to be killed.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.923]  It's just dehumanization from every angle so you won't stand up for yourself and you won't stand up for others.
[01:52:28.083 --> 01:52:29.044]  And they got us all then.
[01:52:29.824 --> 01:52:30.585]  But take war.
[01:52:30.685 --> 01:52:32.525]  In the last 30 years or so, the U.S.
[01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:39.689]  has done 90% of its fighting or more with drones and unmanned vehicles.
[01:52:40.956 --> 01:52:42.076]  So we don't even know who we're killing.
[01:52:43.397 --> 01:52:45.337]  And Obama bragged, I'm really good at killing people.
[01:52:46.418 --> 01:52:47.938]  You know, two words, predator drones.
[01:52:49.598 --> 01:52:53.119]  So, that's all part of the dehumanization, where it's just you hit a button.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:58.581]  But now we're running into China that has a multi-million man army running into Iran.
[01:52:58.981 --> 01:53:00.782]  They've got drones too, so does Russia.
[01:53:01.742 --> 01:53:03.783]  But now they're willing to put troops into combat.
[01:53:04.603 --> 01:53:13.030]   So, Time's running out really quick, and you reach a level of mutually assured destruction with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that we've passed a long time ago.
[01:53:13.810 --> 01:53:19.593]  So now they've moved on from the Muslims to wars with countries that have nuclear weapons.
[01:53:20.473 --> 01:53:24.355]  And so it's a very, very dangerous Rubicon that we've crossed.
[01:53:24.775 --> 01:53:26.515]  Larry, thanks for calling from Ohio.
[01:53:26.535 --> 01:53:27.156]  Thanks for holding.
[01:53:27.196 --> 01:53:27.916]  Larry, go ahead.
[01:53:29.677 --> 01:53:30.237]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:30.257 --> 01:53:31.057]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:53:31.738 --> 01:53:32.598]  I'm definitely in the fight.
[01:53:32.678 --> 01:53:33.438]  That's where I want to be.
[01:53:33.498 --> 01:53:34.499]  So that's where I asked to be.
[01:53:34.559 --> 01:53:34.899]  Here I am.
[01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.830]  Definitely.
[01:53:37.471 --> 01:53:44.279]  Before I ask for your opinion of what's happened in the last couple days, I have a real simple request.
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.182]  You like to play music in your intros.
[01:53:47.763 --> 01:53:50.226]  You played Horse With No Name.
[01:53:50.286 --> 01:53:51.387]  I remember that song.
[01:53:51.447 --> 01:53:53.550]  I was stationed in Maryland when that song came out in 72.
[01:53:55.063 --> 01:53:56.804]  My request is a song.
[01:53:57.404 --> 01:53:59.045]  It's called Eva Destruction.
[01:53:59.366 --> 01:54:02.007]  Alex, it's as if you're the one singing the song.
[01:54:02.367 --> 01:54:03.148]  The words to it.
[01:54:03.268 --> 01:54:05.989]  Oh, I love, I love Eva... I don't love what's happening in it.
[01:54:06.209 --> 01:54:08.331]  We'll play Eva Destruction coming in next segment.
[01:54:08.691 --> 01:54:10.232]  Guys, get Eva... Who sings that?
[01:54:11.661 --> 01:54:13.162]  I can't remember the man's name.
[01:54:13.602 --> 01:54:14.663]  I know your crew knows.
[01:54:14.823 --> 01:54:16.684]  They'll bring it up and they'll tell you instantly.
[01:54:16.904 --> 01:54:18.285]  No, I feel stupid not remembering.
[01:54:19.146 --> 01:54:20.067]  There it is.
[01:54:20.827 --> 01:54:24.049]  When that song came out in 1965, I was 12 years old.
[01:54:24.349 --> 01:54:26.251]  It got a big, big reaction.
[01:54:26.411 --> 01:54:28.932]  It was one of the best protest songs ever played.
[01:54:29.873 --> 01:54:30.573]  Good and bad.
[01:54:30.974 --> 01:54:32.094]  I mean, it was huge.
[01:54:32.194 --> 01:54:36.126]   But anyhow, That song, I wish you would play it repeatedly.
[01:54:36.527 --> 01:54:40.210]  It'll get people's attention, especially people my age, because they'll remember it.
[01:54:40.450 --> 01:54:41.531]  I'm 70 years old.
[01:54:41.651 --> 01:54:42.652]  I know they'll remember.
[01:54:43.833 --> 01:54:47.937]  Beyond all that, now, here's what I want to know, and I want your opinion of this.
[01:54:48.797 --> 01:54:50.859]  Down to the T as close as you can get to it.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:52.701]  Okay.
[01:54:53.942 --> 01:55:03.562]   The Arabs from Iran went to the UN, made his statement that if Israel proceeds We're going to turn loose the cells.
[01:55:04.022 --> 01:55:09.126]  My point with this is, if you ever notice, the Arabs always like to telegraph.
[01:55:09.286 --> 01:55:10.486]  They like to grandstand.
[01:55:10.787 --> 01:55:11.927]  They like to telegraph.
[01:55:12.528 --> 01:55:14.429]  The Chinese, they don't do that.
[01:55:14.689 --> 01:55:19.152]  And I know that from my own personal experience in the Navy over there in Vietnam.
[01:55:19.492 --> 01:55:19.852]  Okay?
[01:55:20.012 --> 01:55:20.893]  They pop up, bud.
[01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:23.735]  And when they pop up, your ass is... Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:55:24.195 --> 01:55:25.756]  Your backside is in trouble.
[01:55:26.016 --> 01:55:26.316]  Okay?
[01:55:28.248 --> 01:55:32.529]  China has gotten their six ships in position, and I've predicted all that.
[01:55:32.549 --> 01:55:33.210]  No, absolutely.
[01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:34.630]  We're being led into a trap.
[01:55:36.010 --> 01:55:37.851]  I don't want to say that word.
[01:55:38.071 --> 01:55:38.511]  You're right.
[01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.051]  Okay.
[01:55:40.112 --> 01:55:41.472]  Now, is this coincidental?
[01:55:41.952 --> 01:55:45.113]  This man goes up and says he's going to turn cells loose.
[01:55:46.033 --> 01:55:47.514]  What was it, a day or two later?
[01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:56.457]  This man does a mass shooting in Maine, and up and disappears, and almost instantly, everybody jumped on the guns and mental health.
[01:55:56.977 --> 01:55:57.277]  Okay?
[01:55:58.644 --> 01:56:00.485]  And then he just disappears.
[01:56:01.325 --> 01:56:12.689]  FBI special operations and border control special operations that are sophisticated, know what they're doing in the dark, go into the woods, but they still can't find him.
[01:56:13.630 --> 01:56:23.674]  And then after that happens, suddenly Biden sends in the plane, and I've said this, as soon as one plane leaves the carrier deck, it's on, it's on.
[01:56:24.114 --> 01:56:28.022]   Well, he sent a plane in, bombed munitions, No.
[01:56:28.543 --> 01:56:33.546]  Now, is this coincidental that all these things happened at once?
[01:56:34.326 --> 01:56:35.247]  One right after the other?
[01:56:35.267 --> 01:56:37.108]  No, I don't think it's coincidental at all.
[01:56:37.148 --> 01:56:38.910]  I mean, Theodore Krasinski was MKUltra.
[01:56:39.450 --> 01:56:40.391]  That's declassified.
[01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:42.632]  There's so many examples of it.
[01:56:42.852 --> 01:56:45.534]  And it's like they flip a switch.
[01:56:46.315 --> 01:56:48.016]  But I was remembering a prediction I made.
[01:56:49.209 --> 01:56:50.730]  Probably a hundred times or more.
[01:56:51.351 --> 01:57:05.541]  Going back to early 2000, I said, once they're done killing us with the COVID shots they're going to come out with, long before they did, then they're going to move on to war, and they're going to launch wars against Russia, the Middle East, and China, and now that's happened.
[01:57:06.062 --> 01:57:08.504]  So we're headed to a very historic moment, Larry.
[01:57:08.524 --> 01:57:09.124]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:09.164 --> 01:57:09.645]  Great points.
[01:57:09.685 --> 01:57:10.265]  Thanks for calling.
[01:57:10.805 --> 01:57:12.126]  Jordan and Texas, go ahead.
[01:57:12.146 --> 01:57:12.567]  You're on the air.
[01:57:13.658 --> 01:57:19.220]  Hey, I've been taking notes this whole show because, you know, you can't watch InfoWars passively, you know.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:22.602]  So you got to pay attention because I'm going to go fast to get this in.
[01:57:23.042 --> 01:57:26.383]  So the first caller, she's talking about Vivek.
[01:57:26.483 --> 01:57:28.584]  And I got to tell you, I got my eyes open.
[01:57:29.264 --> 01:57:30.605]  I got my eyes open by this.
[01:57:30.705 --> 01:57:33.466]  Just Google, keeping it fake with Vivek.
[01:57:34.082 --> 01:57:35.403]  That's all you gotta do.
[01:57:35.443 --> 01:57:37.123]  You Google that, you find.
[01:57:37.543 --> 01:57:40.625]  And the next thing, Alex, you're flipping through your pages.
[01:57:40.705 --> 01:57:41.965]  I see this dragon drawing.
[01:57:42.345 --> 01:57:44.586]  I see this dragon drawing that you got on your pages.
[01:57:44.726 --> 01:57:52.410]  And man, that reminded me, you promised us a painting show where you're just gonna come out and you're gonna paint and talk about... Well, that's right.
[01:57:52.450 --> 01:57:54.590]  I was thinking about Communist China a minute ago.
[01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:56.591]  I was live on air when I drew it.
[01:57:56.611 --> 01:57:57.712]  I didn't know somebody cut to that.
[01:57:57.732 --> 01:58:00.313]  I don't know where it is now, but I drew a little dragon.
[01:58:00.333 --> 01:58:01.433]  I was thinking about China.
[01:58:01.453 --> 01:58:02.894]  I don't know where it is now.
[01:58:04.174 --> 01:58:04.494]  You're right.
[01:58:04.534 --> 01:58:05.355]  I want to do all that.
[01:58:05.515 --> 01:58:06.196]  I want to do all that.
[01:58:07.176 --> 01:58:10.719]  The main thing I called in for, I called in for is Russian chat.
[01:58:10.939 --> 01:58:15.522]  Like, you know, I was watching you and Nick and I'm thinking, why is nobody connecting this stuff?
[01:58:15.562 --> 01:58:17.783]  Because the Russians, they're all the chat.
[01:58:18.044 --> 01:58:26.169]  And so the Russians is paying the Hamas, the Iranians to get the Hamas to attack Israel so that we stop sending Ukraine.
[01:58:26.650 --> 01:58:29.331]  And it's, why is nobody seeing this?
[01:58:29.832 --> 01:58:33.034]  And it's just, it's just crazy that nobody catches it.
[01:58:34.622 --> 01:58:36.583]  Well, I think it's time for Fentanyl the Dragon.
[01:58:36.623 --> 01:58:37.383]  People don't know what that is.
[01:58:37.403 --> 01:58:39.184]  It's a comedy piece I did a few times.
[01:58:39.204 --> 01:58:40.044]  It's super popular.
[01:58:40.605 --> 01:58:44.506]  The problem is my daughter saw it once when I had it on the TV at home and loves it.
[01:58:44.946 --> 01:58:47.247]  So she's always like, Daddy, I want Fentanyl.
[01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:48.088]  People are like, what the hell?
[01:58:48.108 --> 01:58:49.248]  Your daughter's talking about Fentanyl?
[01:58:49.328 --> 01:58:51.149]  It's the name of the dragon from China.
[01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.989]  It's a comedy piece.
[01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:54.290]  I should do another Fentanyl piece.
[01:58:54.851 --> 01:58:56.891]  It's like, hello dumb Americans.
[01:58:56.951 --> 01:58:58.592]  I'm going into a trap.
[01:58:59.032 --> 01:59:01.493]  You guys look good, Joe Biden.
[01:59:01.613 --> 01:59:02.314]  Good.
[01:59:03.723 --> 01:59:05.244]  So I think it's time for him to reappear.
[01:59:06.986 --> 01:59:07.346]  Come on.
[01:59:07.446 --> 01:59:10.109]  We gotta talk about Russia playing chess with us.
[01:59:12.951 --> 01:59:14.453]  Do you not hear me?
[01:59:14.473 --> 01:59:15.353]  Do you not get that?
[01:59:15.453 --> 01:59:16.494]  No, you're on the air, brother.
[01:59:16.534 --> 01:59:17.075]  I'm listening to you.
[01:59:17.790 --> 01:59:30.135]  Okay, so I'm saying that Russia's playing chess, that they got Iran to fund Hamas to attack Israel, so that we stop funding Ukraine and we're sending more money over to Israel.
[01:59:30.855 --> 01:59:32.596]  I'm not an apologist for Russia.
[01:59:33.437 --> 01:59:36.658]  It was Biden who gave $6 billion to Iran to give to Hamas.
[01:59:36.978 --> 01:59:40.019]  It was Biden who gave $87 billion in Afghanistan.
[01:59:40.059 --> 01:59:43.721]  You just said Russia is getting Iran to fund Hamas?
[01:59:44.855 --> 01:59:46.516]  That's what I think is going on.
[01:59:46.577 --> 01:59:50.500]  But, you know, the $6 billion thing, that was unfreezing assets that they already had.
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:51.561]  We weren't giving them money.
[01:59:52.001 --> 01:59:52.321]  You know?
[01:59:52.622 --> 01:59:54.503]  Well, I mean, but it is giving them money.
[01:59:54.543 --> 01:59:56.485]  It was their assets, but it's $6 billion they had.
[01:59:57.526 --> 02:00:00.248]  What was Afghanistan and the $400 million?
[02:00:00.268 --> 02:00:02.049]  What was Afghanistan and the $87 million?
[02:00:02.089 --> 02:00:02.650]  Was that Russia?
[02:00:05.186 --> 02:00:05.706]  I don't know.
[02:00:05.866 --> 02:00:06.227]  I don't know.
[02:00:06.347 --> 02:00:08.428]  I just think Russia plays more chess than we do.
[02:00:08.468 --> 02:00:09.748]  That's for damn sure.
[02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:12.030]  Oh, I agree with you that we're marching into a trap, Jordan.
[02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:12.790]  I appreciate your call.
[02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:38.145]   Alright, we're going to play Eva Destruction since you asked for it, and then we're going to, or part of it, for analyzing purposes, cultural analysis purposes, critique, and then we're going to get to Greg Reeves' report, and then John in Kentucky, Scott, Tone, Marcel, Freedom Cheese, Adam, Robbie, and others.
[02:00:38.506 --> 02:00:40.206]  We'll get to every caller there, but that's enough calls.
[02:00:40.246 --> 02:00:41.007]  No more calls after that.
[02:00:40.827 --> 02:00:42.587]  We're not going to take any more calls.
[02:00:42.587 --> 02:00:43.306]  Back to those people.
[02:00:43.787 --> 02:00:47.706]  The Eastern world, it is exploding.
[02:00:47.706 --> 02:00:52.266]  Violence flaring, bullets loading.
[02:00:52.266 --> 02:00:56.426]  You're old enough to kill, but not for voting.
[02:00:56.426 --> 02:01:00.747]  You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're toting?
[02:01:00.744 --> 02:01:12.744]   And even the Jordan River has bodies floating But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
[02:01:12.744 --> 02:01:29.744]   Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
[02:01:29.744 --> 02:01:32.744]  Can't you feel the fears I'm feeling today?
[02:01:32.744 --> 02:01:40.744]   If the button is pushed, there's no running away There'll be no one to save, we're the world in a grave
[02:01:40.744 --> 02:01:52.744]   Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
[02:01:52.744 --> 02:02:01.604]   Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction As Israel now rolls into Gaza with the ground invasion.
[02:02:01.684 --> 02:02:02.104]  It's on.
[02:02:03.585 --> 02:02:04.285]  Pray for everybody.
[02:02:04.325 --> 02:02:04.965]  Pray for those children.
[02:02:06.926 --> 02:02:11.246]   and ask who funded Hamas, who created it, who stood down on October 7th.
[02:02:11.246 --> 02:02:18.246]  [music]
[02:02:18.246 --> 02:02:25.246]   I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation, handful of senators don't pass legislation,
[02:02:25.246 --> 02:02:34.246]   and marches alone can't bring integration, when human respect is disintegrating.
[02:02:34.246 --> 02:02:44.246]   This whole crazy world is just too frustrating, and you tell me over and over and over again,
[02:02:45.246 --> 02:02:52.246]   my friend, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
[02:02:52.246 --> 02:02:57.246]  We're gonna go to the special report by Greg Reese.
[02:02:55.494 --> 02:02:56.935]  You can share it and video.
[02:02:56.955 --> 02:02:57.616]  That's why we built it.
[02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:59.036]  It's why we're fighting hard against tyranny.
[02:02:59.076 --> 02:03:00.137]  It's why you're so critical.
[02:03:00.557 --> 02:03:02.599]  You're not just part of the equation, you're everything.
[02:03:03.079 --> 02:03:11.354]   If you don't share the articles, the videos, via email, your text messages, word of mouth, to strangers, to friends, to family, We're not on the eve of destruction.
[02:03:11.414 --> 02:03:16.819]  We are in the dark night.
[02:03:16.919 --> 02:03:18.941]  We are going into the destruction.
[02:03:18.981 --> 02:03:19.962]  We are in the destruction.
[02:03:19.982 --> 02:03:20.963]  We are in the New World Order.
[02:03:21.383 --> 02:03:22.444]  We are in the Great Reset.
[02:03:22.484 --> 02:03:23.585]  We are in the Build Back Better.
[02:03:23.625 --> 02:03:25.587]  We are in the Satanic Takeover.
[02:03:26.107 --> 02:03:27.408]  And now God is watching.
[02:03:28.289 --> 02:03:31.091]  So here is Greg Reese's new report.
[02:03:31.231 --> 02:03:33.633]  Again, that is at Band.Video.
[02:03:34.054 --> 02:03:35.515]  Biblical views about the end times.
[02:03:35.335 --> 02:03:37.335]  We'll go back to your calls.
[02:03:37.335 --> 02:03:44.494]  [MUSIC]
[02:03:44.494 --> 02:03:49.414]   The original copies of the Old Testament were written in Hebrew and
[02:03:49.414 --> 02:03:54.814]   Aramaic, the Apocrypha in Greek and Latin, and the New Testament in Greek.
[02:03:55.606 --> 02:04:05.409]  Different aspects of these three sources were translated into English and compiled into the King James Bible, commissioned in 1604 by King James VI and published in 1611.
[02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:17.827]  According to Manly P. Hall, it was edited by Francis Bacon and prepared under Masonic supervision, which can be seen on its title page.
[02:04:19.383 --> 02:04:22.726]  The most talked about book of the Bible is the book of Revelation.
[02:04:23.286 --> 02:04:27.850]  And throughout church history, there have been four different viewpoints regarding its meaning.
[02:04:28.590 --> 02:04:34.355]  The idealist or spiritual view uses the allegorical method to interpret the book of Revelation.
[02:04:34.915 --> 02:04:40.220]  This viewpoint believes the book is using symbolic imagery to tell the story of good against evil.
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:47.465]  Edgar Cayce believed it was describing both the collapse of an age and the spiritual enlightenment of an individual.
[02:04:48.311 --> 02:04:52.475]  The futurist view is that the Bible is to be interpreted literally.
[02:04:52.996 --> 02:05:01.365]  They are expecting a seven-year tribulation, culminating with the Battle of Armageddon, followed by a thousand-year rule of Christ on Earth.
[02:05:02.306 --> 02:05:09.373]  The historicist view is that Revelation is a symbolic account of history, from the apostles to the end times.
[02:05:10.134 --> 02:05:19.983]  And the Preterist view, the focus of this video, is that the biblical prophecies were already fulfilled in 70 AD and we are living in the New Kingdom today.
[02:05:20.663 --> 02:05:22.785]  Their first argument is scripture itself.
[02:05:23.305 --> 02:05:26.969]  Christ predicted his return in the lifetime of his contemporaries.
[02:05:27.549 --> 02:05:32.593]  Liberal critics have used this as proof of Christ's failure to return when he promised to.
[02:05:33.134 --> 02:05:42.173]   The Preterist points to Matthew 24, 34, where Jesus states, "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away
[02:05:42.173 --> 02:05:45.052]  until all these things take place."
[02:05:45.052 --> 02:05:49.134]   And they look to the historical record, where they have found several sources
[02:05:49.134 --> 02:05:54.653]   who recorded dozens of events between the years 66 and 70 AD
[02:05:54.653 --> 02:06:02.172]   that reflect those described in biblical prophecy, such as the angels in Matthew 24, 31.
[02:06:02.384 --> 02:06:18.452]  Josephus wrote that in the spring of 66, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor were seen running about among the clouds, an event described by Roman historian Tacitus as hosts joining battle in the skies.
[02:06:19.312 --> 02:06:33.279]  According to the Preterist, the book of Revelation was about the tribulations of the Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the Old Testament Jewish age, and the beginning of the New Testament Christian age.
[02:06:34.059 --> 02:06:47.683]   As Edward Stevens wrote, The unbelieving Jews were cut off from their inheritance and destroyed, while the faithful remnant of believing Jews, along with Gentiles, inherited those covenantal blessings.
[02:06:48.083 --> 02:06:58.730]   Thus, the establishment of the Eternal Kingdom of Christ at the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 Was the fulfillment of all the things that were promised to God's chosen people.
[02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:03.415]  The Preterist believes that we are now living in the new kingdom of Christ.
[02:07:03.875 --> 02:07:09.942]  And point out that when Jesus and the apostles were describing the coming kingdom, they were not describing a paradise.
[02:07:10.362 --> 02:07:14.186]  They were describing how man must act and behave within the new kingdom.
[02:07:14.966 --> 02:07:24.691]  They believe that the land of Israel is no longer in the flesh, that those promises are fulfilled in Jesus and his spiritual kingdom, which all Christians now enjoy.
[02:07:25.652 --> 02:07:39.500]  Like the QAnon PSYOP, preterists argue that the End Times prophecy is being used to incapacitate a would-be Christian opposition to the evil control system currently being built to enslave humanity.
[02:07:40.140 --> 02:07:46.364]  There are millions of religious people who welcome this destruction because they believe it is the divine will of God.
[02:07:47.005 --> 02:07:51.968]  Why did they choose to give a Mark of the Beast style microchip the patents number 060606?
[02:07:55.450 --> 02:08:04.833]  Was it fate or a way to cement the futurist belief into the minds of Christians so that they believe destruction is unstoppable and resistance futile?
[02:08:05.633 --> 02:08:14.055]  There are many different belief systems, but where is the good in sitting idly by to watch as evil devours the world around us?
[02:08:14.875 --> 02:08:17.875]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:08:18.875 --> 02:08:24.875]   Alright, I'm going to lay something really, really heavy on you, okay?
[02:08:25.393 --> 02:08:26.873]  This video just went live minutes ago.
[02:08:30.776 --> 02:08:32.897]  I think Greg Reese's report is informative.
[02:08:34.818 --> 02:08:35.819]  I don't run a cult here.
[02:08:35.839 --> 02:08:37.460]  I hire people I like, that I think are smart.
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:38.480]  They have different views than me.
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:39.801]  Let's say 10%.
[02:08:40.701 --> 02:08:42.542]  So I don't agree with the Preterist view.
[02:08:42.562 --> 02:08:44.063]  I've read the book he shows there.
[02:08:44.103 --> 02:08:51.908]  I've listened to probably, let's not exaggerate, 200 hours of Preterist stuff in the last three decades.
[02:08:54.168 --> 02:08:58.633]  And at the same time, everybody gets mad at me.
[02:09:00.195 --> 02:09:07.564]  There is not a pre-tribulation, and it didn't happen in 7 AD when Titus sacked Jerusalem.
[02:09:09.546 --> 02:09:12.369]  It's going to happen 10 years, 20 years, 50 years.
[02:09:12.509 --> 02:09:13.671]  I'm not sure it's in the future.
[02:09:15.649 --> 02:09:21.031]  It is 100% clear the things that they said were going to come, that are now happening now, did not happen until now.
[02:09:21.071 --> 02:09:29.815]  There's not a world government, you couldn't have seen the Antichrist on, you know, in the square as a giant 30-foot hologram.
[02:09:30.495 --> 02:09:36.237]  Now the new TVs are coming out, it's going to be holograms, you already see it, the big hologram light shows and firework shows.
[02:09:36.938 --> 02:09:38.878]  And I could go on for 10 hours, but I want to go to your calls.
[02:09:40.599 --> 02:09:44.921]  Everything in there is only describing what is now, just now, happening.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:46.600]  And it's very clear.
[02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:51.901]  But I think it's fair to look at what the preterists say and look what the pre-tribulation people say.
[02:09:52.361 --> 02:10:00.263]  And the pre-tribulation people are the most angry because look at Christians persecuted for 2,000 plus years.
[02:10:02.003 --> 02:10:05.464]  And even the UN admits it's the greatest Christian persecution in history right now.
[02:10:06.084 --> 02:10:07.905]  It's exponential.
[02:10:10.105 --> 02:10:17.457]   And the churches don't want to sit there as the mark of the beast and the world government rolls out Most churches, almost all of them, aren't talking about it.
[02:10:18.317 --> 02:10:20.039]  Because people want to think you just get beamed up.
[02:10:20.079 --> 02:10:20.959]  Hey, beam me up, Scotty.
[02:10:21.019 --> 02:10:23.081]  All right, the devil's taking over.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:29.480]   It says in Revelation, you can pull up the text, that after the archangel bound Satan with a chain,
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:39.239]   and after Christ has defeated Satan at the Battle of Armageddon, then the dead of Christ are resurrected and raptured.
[02:10:39.239 --> 02:10:49.319]  A five-year-old could read that.
[02:10:49.567 --> 02:10:59.651]  So, Christians and people didn't get to dodge facing evil under Hitler, or in the Soviet Union, or Communist China, or Venezuela, or anywhere.
[02:11:01.792 --> 02:11:09.495]  So, you talk about a Masonic teaching, a modern Masonic teaching, the last 150 years is this pre-trip.
[02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:16.418]  A five-year-old could read the Bible and see that it comes after Satan is defeated.
[02:11:18.746 --> 02:11:19.507]  But let's go further.
[02:11:20.748 --> 02:11:34.079]  What about that part that he showed there, which is on record, the Greeks saw it, the Chinese wrote about it, they've been around longer than anybody in writing, 6,000 years, as a continuous culture.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.662]  There were cultures older, but they went away.
[02:11:36.682 --> 02:11:53.129]   The same day, the same year, the Jews who kept a good history, And the Romans and the Greeks all reported a space battle with what they called chariots flying around in broad daylight, blowing each other up in the sky.
[02:11:55.989 --> 02:11:59.989]  Whatever that was, space battle.
[02:11:59.989 --> 02:12:10.989]   Now, I'm not trying to start a church and I'm not trying to be your spiritual leader.
[02:12:11.877 --> 02:12:13.518]  I only go off what I've experienced.
[02:12:13.558 --> 02:12:15.620]  And I have prayed to see God.
[02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:17.642]  I have prayed to be touched by God.
[02:12:17.662 --> 02:12:19.583]  I have prayed to be led God and directed by God.
[02:12:21.185 --> 02:12:37.098]  And I have had what you call visions when I'm awake, but also particularly when I'm asleep, where, as King David talked about being taken up to the third heaven, I've been given absolute peace, completion, and shown a lot of things.
[02:12:38.072 --> 02:12:41.054]  And I can't even describe it because it's nothing you've ever seen.
[02:12:41.554 --> 02:12:47.777]  The things I've seen, if I wanted to go to Hollywood right now, because you think you've seen everything?
[02:12:48.238 --> 02:12:50.179]  They've said, you know, nothing's new under the sun.
[02:12:50.239 --> 02:12:53.560]  That's not true beyond this planet.
[02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:56.122]  Yeah, there's nothing new under the sun on this planet, but there is.
[02:12:57.022 --> 02:13:05.707]  Things I've seen, things that have gone on that are like, if I went and had artists create this and draw this, no one's ever seen this that I've ever heard anybody talk about.
[02:13:09.662 --> 02:13:22.951]  And it would just but but I'm like blocked from even talking about it because it's like a metaphysical seal that no you've been shown this but you're not supposed to talk about it so I'm not gonna talk about it.
[02:13:25.913 --> 02:13:32.057]  And I'm not holding things back from people it's just that I can't even describe it and it's for me.
[02:13:32.907 --> 02:13:36.569]  Now, I'm sure you've been given enlightenment or been touched by God, many of you.
[02:13:37.089 --> 02:13:44.414]  You understand what it's like when you're touched by an angel, touched by God's agent, touched by the watchers that are the angels, and you're shown this stuff.
[02:13:44.454 --> 02:13:46.955]  You're like, it's so big.
[02:13:46.995 --> 02:14:00.963]  You're like, I don't even want to talk about this because I cannot, with my feeble brain and my feeble acumen for description, try to even describe this.
[02:14:05.111 --> 02:14:09.953]  But there is a war in heaven, just as there is a war here.
[02:14:10.053 --> 02:14:11.034]  We were put here.
[02:14:11.954 --> 02:14:15.736]  We didn't evolve from monkeys or apes.
[02:14:17.977 --> 02:14:20.278]  And we're far more ancient than you're told.
[02:14:20.739 --> 02:14:22.159]  And you instinctively know that.
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:27.322]  You watch a movie like Star Wars or 2001, you feel like you've been there.
[02:14:27.382 --> 02:14:28.563]  It's like, I know this.
[02:14:28.443 --> 02:14:37.443]  This is something you already know.
[02:14:37.443 --> 02:14:40.443]  And for whatever reason, there were groups of humans...
[02:14:40.443 --> 02:14:44.443]  I'm going to go ahead and release some powerful information.
[02:14:45.094 --> 02:14:56.398]  There were groups of humans put here that had no genetic memory from the past, who were basically clean clones, is the best way I can describe it.
[02:14:57.990 --> 02:15:03.731]  And then there have been groups of people put here that were given the ancestral memory and connections to it for whatever reason.
[02:15:04.171 --> 02:15:13.673]  And I've tried to understand God's plan of why did you put different groups, some that didn't have a download, and then some that did.
[02:15:13.693 --> 02:15:19.234]  And you could say those of us that have the download were in the Garden of Eden, not on this planet.
[02:15:20.895 --> 02:15:26.878]   Not the tigers and Euphrates like these Very simple preachers try to interpret it.
[02:15:27.498 --> 02:15:30.800]  But in the garden, there was no crime, there was no problems.
[02:15:31.121 --> 02:15:31.601]  I've seen it.
[02:15:31.661 --> 02:15:33.362]  It's like total completion.
[02:15:34.202 --> 02:15:34.903]  There's no time.
[02:15:34.963 --> 02:15:37.544]  It's so perfect.
[02:15:38.565 --> 02:15:39.866]  It's beyond ecstasy.
[02:15:39.886 --> 02:15:47.210]  There's no words in a human way that you've not experienced unless you've experienced peace.
[02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:48.231]  Total completion.
[02:15:48.871 --> 02:15:50.072]  Total satisfaction.
[02:15:50.752 --> 02:15:51.393]  Timelessness.
[02:15:54.541 --> 02:15:55.221]  It's indescribable.
[02:15:59.605 --> 02:16:10.614]  But those of us that were actually given the memory were cursed because there's also the memory of the fall and evil.
[02:16:12.235 --> 02:16:23.989]   So when you get the knowledge of total completion and total perfection and the Messiah's spirit, you're not the Messiah, but you've seen the Messiah, Like Moses, he couldn't look right at it.
[02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:26.170]  Look at the sun, but he could look through a bush.
[02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:27.471]  That's a metaphor.
[02:16:27.491 --> 02:16:31.833]  I believe it happened, but I'm saying it was like, this is like, you cannot even comprehend this.
[02:16:31.853 --> 02:16:33.054]  You have to see it through a lens.
[02:16:33.374 --> 02:16:34.114]  It's too powerful.
[02:16:35.075 --> 02:16:35.535]  It'll kill you.
[02:16:36.275 --> 02:16:36.695]  It'll kill you.
[02:16:37.016 --> 02:16:44.780]  Because it's the only death that can even begin if you've been chosen in the frequency resonance to even join with it.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:47.441]  And this is a, it's like panning for gold.
[02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:48.762]  God is panning for gold.
[02:16:49.864 --> 02:17:03.028]  And knows that for a new free will creature that's given unlimited potential, not a God, but a little God, made in the image of God, with the potential of God, this is the big secret, is they don't want this known.
[02:17:04.488 --> 02:17:06.369]  And the enemy can't even comprehend it.
[02:17:06.429 --> 02:17:15.591]  So they, it's a joke how they go about trying to act like God and kill people and learn all the secrets and do all this when you just got to get connected to God.
[02:17:16.292 --> 02:17:43.233]   But what I'm trying to get at here is, Large groups of people, even if your ancestors had it, if God doesn't choose you to have knowledge of good and evil, there are a lot of people that are human, but they don't have the capacity to understand good versus evil.
[02:17:46.283 --> 02:17:48.744]  Which in a way is a blessing, but it's also a curse.
[02:17:49.564 --> 02:18:08.610]  So God set it up where some people have knowledge of good and evil, and some people are in the line of Adam, and understand how it all works, and then other people don't, and it's all in God's mystery, and I don't understand the science or the incredible alchemy of this, but I've seen it, and that's basically what this comes down to.
[02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:12.310]   Because most people Get knowledge of evil.
[02:18:12.931 --> 02:18:14.752]  And evil just means something going against God.
[02:18:15.833 --> 02:18:21.818]  Systems that build outside of God's perfect plan that work really good for you at first, but always lead to destruction.
[02:18:22.799 --> 02:18:23.500]  It's like cancer.
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:26.782]  Again, if it had a consciousness, it would take over your body.
[02:18:27.728 --> 02:18:39.674]  Which it does, and if it had a conscious system it would think, I'm the best, I'm ruling, I can race through the cells, take over bones, take over brain, take over blood, take over organs, take over the skin, take over the eyes, but then you kill the host.
[02:18:40.214 --> 02:18:41.215]  That's the knowledge of evil.
[02:18:42.436 --> 02:18:54.622]  Whereas there is alignment with God and God's love that then you basically are then prepared spiritually, genetically, to merge with God.
[02:18:54.662 --> 02:19:14.313]   But God has created a free will universe where There are people that are given the knowledge of good and evil, and you can call that predestination, which means you've already been given the knowledge, and there are a lot of people who don't even understand that, and who can't even see it.
[02:19:15.193 --> 02:19:23.636]  And at a Luciferian level, they would call people like that goyim or animals, because, well, if you don't see all this, you must be an animal.
[02:19:24.296 --> 02:19:30.999]   But that's not what's happening They at some point have been shielded from it and are like children.
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:38.345]  And that's why Christ said, suffer the children unto me what you do to them you've done to me.
[02:19:41.328 --> 02:19:43.310]  Because we're meant to lead the children.
[02:19:44.651 --> 02:19:46.973]  And there are people that are simple-minded spiritually.
[02:19:46.993 --> 02:19:49.095]  They're black, white, Asian, you name it.
[02:19:49.835 --> 02:19:50.536]  It's in every group.
[02:19:52.437 --> 02:19:55.360]  And we're here to save them.
[02:19:57.125 --> 02:19:59.606]  Even though Bill Gates says, just kill them, these people are annoying.
[02:19:59.626 --> 02:20:03.807]  Because he's got knowledge of good and evil, but he didn't have the real knowledge of how to navigate that.
[02:20:03.847 --> 02:20:04.407]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:20:04.607 --> 02:20:05.307]  This is the big secret.
[02:20:07.408 --> 02:20:12.789]  So you take, in general, the Jews, super IQs, smart, and everything, wow, we're special, they know it.
[02:20:13.149 --> 02:20:15.530]  And then some say, just wipe everybody out, because we're better than them.
[02:20:15.550 --> 02:20:16.670]  Well, that's what Hitler was saying.
[02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:18.151]  He saw that as a competing thing.
[02:20:18.671 --> 02:20:23.032]  You're not going to find the Kingdom of Heaven by cutting off the little people.
[02:20:24.178 --> 02:20:25.919]  God has a plan for these children.
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:30.242]  For whatever reason, they've been spared the understanding.
[02:20:30.282 --> 02:20:31.523]  They've been spared this.
[02:20:31.543 --> 02:20:34.145]  And I envy them.
[02:20:36.766 --> 02:20:45.352]  And if we forget them, and we kill them... Just like saying your dog's dumb, so you put it in the microwave oven.
[02:20:45.392 --> 02:20:46.033]  Why would you do that?
[02:20:46.613 --> 02:20:47.654]  It's dumb, but it loves you.
[02:20:48.534 --> 02:20:53.758]  Because God has some plan, and I believe we are testing the children.
[02:20:55.001 --> 02:21:00.984]  At some level, I believe we're going to be destroyed, those of us that were given evil, because nothing evil can go forward in the future.
[02:21:02.024 --> 02:21:08.967]  And so while the globalists are so busy trying to kill the children, we have to save them.
[02:21:09.428 --> 02:21:11.408]  And our only hope is saving them.
[02:21:12.489 --> 02:21:16.831]  And if we don't save the children, God's going to cut us off.
[02:21:17.771 --> 02:21:18.992]  Now that's what I wanted to say.
[02:21:19.272 --> 02:21:20.112]  Jade Eyre's coming up.
[02:21:20.172 --> 02:21:21.173]  I promised to go to John.
[02:21:22.017 --> 02:21:36.272]   Adam, Freedom, Tease, Marshall, Tone, Scott, I don't usually take away from Jay Dyer because he's really smart but I swore to take your call so I'll probably go ahead about 10 after and we'll Skip the two network breaks so Jay Dyer gets his time back.
[02:21:37.012 --> 02:21:42.655]  But that is a failed, broken vessel trying to interpret infinity to you.
[02:21:42.975 --> 02:21:47.898]  So I didn't give you anything close to perfection, but I gave you deep knowledge.
[02:21:48.518 --> 02:21:50.459]  We're talking secrets of secrets.
[02:21:50.499 --> 02:22:02.345]  The enemy doesn't even understand themselves fully and are shaking because they know I have been given the direct download that I cannot even interpret or understand, but only tiny bits of.
[02:22:02.645 --> 02:22:04.326]  But I have, I have been given it.
[02:22:04.366 --> 02:22:05.326]  There is no doubt about that.
[02:22:05.947 --> 02:22:06.627]  No doubt about that.
[02:22:07.548 --> 02:22:10.169]  And you've been given it if you have been given the knowledge of good and evil.
[02:22:10.829 --> 02:22:11.710]  If you've been cursed!
[02:22:14.851 --> 02:22:18.813]  Whatever your ancestors did, obviously not on this planet.
[02:22:20.214 --> 02:22:21.395]  We are the aliens, folks.
[02:22:21.735 --> 02:22:24.116]  They just created another batch of us that didn't have the memory.
[02:22:24.816 --> 02:22:26.537]  I just gave you the big, the big download.
[02:22:26.677 --> 02:22:27.778]  The enemy already knows that.
[02:22:28.958 --> 02:22:29.939]  And that's the biggest secret.
[02:22:30.459 --> 02:22:31.720]  We didn't come from this planet.
[02:22:33.430 --> 02:22:36.971]  But another group was created that did not have the memory, the knowledge of evil.
[02:22:37.712 --> 02:22:43.754]  So you've been given temporarily the ultimate secret of this planet, directly downloaded.
[02:22:44.794 --> 02:22:47.856]  And that's why they fear me, because they do not want that message given to you.
[02:22:48.876 --> 02:22:52.117]  We save the children or we'll be destroyed.
[02:22:54.718 --> 02:22:57.919]  God's given us this chance to not repeat what we did.
[02:23:01.201 --> 02:23:06.205]   The ancients said, In the planet of the Dog Star.
[02:23:06.265 --> 02:23:09.248]  Who knows if that's even what it is, but all the ancient cultures said that.
[02:23:09.668 --> 02:23:13.050]  Whatever we did somewhere else, we're not supposed to repeat it again here.
[02:23:13.471 --> 02:23:14.331]  This is our chance.
[02:23:15.012 --> 02:23:16.153]  We're supposed to fix it now.
[02:23:16.633 --> 02:23:19.995]  Now, I didn't plug last hour and I hate plugging and I don't want to be...
[02:23:20.976 --> 02:23:21.756]  A fatalist here.
[02:23:22.157 --> 02:23:24.158]  But InfoWars is in the most perilous ever, man.
[02:23:24.518 --> 02:23:25.918]  I need funds to fight the enemy.
[02:23:26.559 --> 02:23:30.020]  I know God's in charge here, so I'm resigned to it all.
[02:23:30.581 --> 02:23:33.182]  But we got great products that will empower your life that are back in stock.
[02:23:34.263 --> 02:23:36.944]  RainForce Ultra, the great fast-acting, wears off quick.
[02:23:36.964 --> 02:23:37.564]  That's why I love it.
[02:23:37.924 --> 02:23:40.325]  You can take it, work four or five hours, go to sleep easily.
[02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:41.726]  Really, three hours.
[02:23:42.446 --> 02:24:01.277]   We got stuff that lasts a lot longer, but the point is we got all the other products, 60% off for Rainforest Ultra, Immune Support, Organic Green Fibers, Vitamin D3 Gummies, Down and Out Sleep Support, Whole Food Multivitamin, Super Female Vitality.
[02:24:01.637 --> 02:24:02.437]  It works on men as well.
[02:24:02.457 --> 02:24:03.917]  It's the same formula, we just ran out of the mail.
[02:24:04.478 --> 02:24:06.478]  People want a different label, so it's pink instead of blue.
[02:24:06.998 --> 02:24:08.059]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:24:08.119 --> 02:24:09.379]  I need funds to fight this thing.
[02:24:09.839 --> 02:24:12.640]  And God says, well, if you want Alex Jones to keep fighting, it's up to you.
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:14.900]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:26.020]  the Second Great Renaissance is there.
[02:24:25.972 --> 02:24:26.692]  It's a great book.
[02:24:27.293 --> 02:24:28.013]  Really powerful.
[02:24:28.053 --> 02:24:29.134]  Twice as long as the last one.
[02:24:29.154 --> 02:24:29.774]  Really proud of it.
[02:24:30.255 --> 02:24:32.877]  And you can do a fundraiser and get the one that's signed or get the regular one.
[02:24:33.257 --> 02:24:34.098]  I appreciate you all.
[02:24:34.398 --> 02:24:35.559]  Takes money to win this war.
[02:24:36.319 --> 02:24:42.303]  But quite frankly, I am completely just advocating everything to God.
[02:24:42.464 --> 02:24:43.284]  I've given it to God.
[02:24:43.644 --> 02:24:44.265]  And I'm just here.
[02:24:45.281 --> 02:24:49.743]  Because if I didn't, no one could take the persecution we're going through 24-7 from every angle.
[02:24:49.763 --> 02:24:50.423]  And I'm not a victim.
[02:24:50.463 --> 02:24:51.043]  I expected this.
[02:24:51.363 --> 02:24:51.903]  I'm a big boy.
[02:24:51.963 --> 02:24:52.504]  I asked for it.
[02:24:53.104 --> 02:24:55.665]  But I would ask you to keep me in the fight as long as you can.
[02:24:55.765 --> 02:24:57.345]  And that's up to God touching your heart to do it.
[02:24:57.765 --> 02:25:05.008]  So get The Great Awakening at infowarestore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:25:06.128 --> 02:25:07.188]  So I've released it.
[02:25:07.208 --> 02:25:10.029]  A lot of these people can't interpret the Bible.
[02:25:11.770 --> 02:25:17.371]   Well, I am giving a direct download of what I can see in the Bible.
[02:25:17.931 --> 02:25:19.332]  Only the discernment can you understand it.
[02:25:19.792 --> 02:25:23.114]  Jay Dyer is set to take over, but I promise to take your calls.
[02:25:23.154 --> 02:25:26.676]  So, John, in the great state of Kentucky, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:25:28.637 --> 02:25:29.477]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:25:29.577 --> 02:25:29.977]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:31.618 --> 02:25:33.779]  Alex, I'm going to tell you right now, man.
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:37.101]  All glory to God, brother.
[02:25:37.161 --> 02:25:42.484]  I mean, even just to come on your show, brother, because I know we're all just mere men and women around here.
[02:25:43.792 --> 02:25:46.173]  Brother, you're a celebrity in my household.
[02:25:46.193 --> 02:25:47.753]  Well, brother, you're a celebrity in my heart.
[02:25:47.873 --> 02:25:48.914]  God formed us.
[02:25:49.794 --> 02:25:53.595]  The Bible describes us as fearfully, as scary how powerful we are.
[02:25:53.835 --> 02:25:56.916]  We are literally forged by the God of the universe.
[02:25:57.697 --> 02:26:04.359]  And God's telling you, you have been given dominion over the universe, not just this planet.
[02:26:05.839 --> 02:26:06.580]  Amen, brother.
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:11.621]  And if I could just take a second, my wife is going to watch this later.
[02:26:11.641 --> 02:26:13.262]  We watch you guys every day.
[02:26:14.501 --> 02:26:18.203]  And if I could just take a second to tell you, Sarah, I love you.
[02:26:19.144 --> 02:26:22.226]  And she's going to watch it later and she's pretty much going to freak out.
[02:26:22.246 --> 02:26:23.126]  No, take more than a second.
[02:26:23.166 --> 02:26:24.527]  Talking about your wife's important.
[02:26:26.729 --> 02:26:33.212]  Well, we, goodness, anytime we have the finances, brother man, we buy as much as we can.
[02:26:34.887 --> 02:26:35.928]  Goodness gracious, man.
[02:26:35.968 --> 02:26:39.630]  I wish I had more money to... Brother, it's fine.
[02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:40.610]  God works for everybody.
[02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:41.551]  We're going to win.
[02:26:41.591 --> 02:26:42.111]  God bless you.
[02:26:42.451 --> 02:26:44.333]  What's your view on what's going on with world events?
[02:26:45.553 --> 02:26:51.757]  Brother, man, I've seen the Lord God twice in my life, and I feel like a rich man.
[02:26:51.777 --> 02:26:54.839]  I work at a Dairy Queen, man.
[02:26:54.859 --> 02:26:56.039]  No, but you are a rich man.
[02:26:56.139 --> 02:26:57.320]  Describe what you saw.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:26:58.000]  What was that like?
[02:27:00.142 --> 02:27:02.323]  I tell you what, my eyes couldn't understand it.
[02:27:02.881 --> 02:27:04.502]  So the Lord let me take pictures.
[02:27:04.742 --> 02:27:07.362]  Now, the first set of pictures have been deleted.
[02:27:07.763 --> 02:27:12.444]  I know the enemy took those away, but there's one picture that I have that stood out.
[02:27:13.364 --> 02:27:22.387]  And I tell you, whenever I've seen him, whenever my eyes were actually opening to the heavens, man, I got to see the Lion of Judah.
[02:27:23.428 --> 02:27:30.670]  And I believe that he was showing me that the first deal has been opened on.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:32.681]  Well, that's happening.
[02:27:32.741 --> 02:27:37.043]  Anybody that's with God is... The communication is really powerful.
[02:27:37.103 --> 02:27:38.124]  It's opening up right now.
[02:27:39.144 --> 02:27:39.625]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:40.025 --> 02:27:48.350]  And I think what we're seeing is we're seeing a prophecy that's already been prophesied.
[02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:50.731]  And I think that we're seeing it.
[02:27:50.791 --> 02:27:57.375]  If anyone has ever wondered what this was going to look like, brother man, I think that we're really witnessing these things.
[02:27:57.455 --> 02:28:12.104]   The violence that is spreading all across America, spreading all across the world, Uh, we've, uh, brother man, we've already read about it and we've read about it and, and, you know, we've, we've heard preachers preach about these things and we're seeing it.
[02:28:12.805 --> 02:28:14.285]  I agree with you and I appreciate your call.
[02:28:14.325 --> 02:28:14.966]  I got a jumper.
[02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:15.626]  I'll get everybody.
[02:28:15.646 --> 02:28:16.066]  Thank you.
[02:28:16.546 --> 02:28:17.666]  Marshall in California.
[02:28:17.706 --> 02:28:18.067]  Go ahead.
[02:28:19.827 --> 02:28:20.407]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:21.628 --> 02:28:21.908]  Welcome.
[02:28:23.055 --> 02:28:24.896]  Um, yeah, so I just wanted to bring it up.
[02:28:24.976 --> 02:28:32.081]  I'm, I'm stockpiling everything, whether it's a reinforced ultra or super female vitality, whatever.
[02:28:32.141 --> 02:28:33.581]  I'm stockpiling everything.
[02:28:33.621 --> 02:28:48.450]  And I just, with that, uh, hormony explosion in Nebraska, I just want, I don't know if everybody's aware that in April of 2022, the army switched up the, uh, gun of choice and they're switching from five, five, six to a 6.8.
[02:28:50.266 --> 02:28:51.447]  And I, I don't know.
[02:28:51.487 --> 02:29:02.374]  I know you got a shield down there in Texas, but in Reno, the shields up here, I mean, they got a four story Ferris wheel in there and they told me they are not getting any more 556 ammo.
[02:29:02.975 --> 02:29:12.561]  So I would say that anybody that has an AR 15 and plans to defend theirself, they better get a 6.8 barrel and some different clips or doing some reload.
[02:29:15.063 --> 02:29:15.463]  You're right.
[02:29:17.222 --> 02:29:41.774]  Yep, and like I said, another simple thing is, I don't have a whole lot of money for a bunch of crazy supplies for food storage, but if everybody just knew that a regular bag of rice can be stored in the same bag for up to 30 years, they would start throwing rice in a 55-gallon truck like I am to feed my five children.
[02:29:42.062 --> 02:29:44.504]  That's beautiful, absolutely simple, basic stuff like that.
[02:29:44.564 --> 02:29:46.506]  Marshall, sorry to cut your short, we're out of time.
[02:29:46.586 --> 02:29:49.749]  Freedom Cheese, Adam & Tone, final call straight ahead.
[02:29:49.789 --> 02:29:51.470]  And then J. Dyer takes over.
[02:29:51.490 --> 02:29:52.551]  We'll skip two network breaks.
[02:29:52.571 --> 02:29:53.692]  He'll get all his time back.
[02:29:54.133 --> 02:29:55.594]  J. Dyer always is incredible.
[02:29:55.654 --> 02:29:56.195]  He's coming up.
[02:29:56.235 --> 02:29:56.695]  Stay with us.
[02:29:56.735 --> 02:29:57.596]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:29:58.957 --> 02:30:00.538]  All these people want to see Satan.
[02:30:01.019 --> 02:30:05.343]  You're gonna get a first row seat to your own destruction.
[02:30:09.286 --> 02:30:11.547]  Ah, let's jam in a few final calls of the great Jay Dyer.
[02:30:11.587 --> 02:30:12.227]  Takes over.
[02:30:12.247 --> 02:30:14.789]  We're going to skip two breaks.
[02:30:14.809 --> 02:30:15.589]  He gets his time back.
[02:30:15.709 --> 02:30:17.190]  Freedom Cheese in New Jersey.
[02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.790]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:17.810 --> 02:30:18.931]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:24.273]  Ah, most important, kudos to you, Alex Jones.
[02:30:24.773 --> 02:30:28.455]  You must have fought a bit of an opponent of the Chinese CCP.
[02:30:28.475 --> 02:30:34.478]  I just, I want to go quick here.
[02:30:35.657 --> 02:30:40.818]  Anybody who has doubts about any of the products, try TurboForce and that comes back.
[02:30:40.878 --> 02:30:42.879]  In about 15 seconds, your brain will be lit up.
[02:30:44.019 --> 02:30:44.839]  When is that coming back?
[02:30:44.899 --> 02:30:46.380]  Hopefully, I'd love to know.
[02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.160]  In a month or so.
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:48.700]  Okay, awesome.
[02:30:49.881 --> 02:31:01.103]  And also, I have like 80,000 Patriot Points I don't use and I would urge people who buy not to use them if they are able because I wonder if there's a way I can donate them back.
[02:31:02.504 --> 02:31:03.004]  That'd be great.
[02:31:03.519 --> 02:31:06.622]  You know, that's an interesting idea, and I hate to bitch all day begging for money.
[02:31:06.682 --> 02:31:11.626]  Part of me wants you to just shut down and stop doing it and just do interviews, but they want us to shut down, so I'm not.
[02:31:11.646 --> 02:31:18.352]  So we're just, the enemy spent 20 plus million dollars this year in the bankruptcy court with their lawyers trying to shut us down.
[02:31:18.652 --> 02:31:20.473]  We spent a few million holding them off.
[02:31:20.814 --> 02:31:22.475]  So yeah, but plus these are products you need.
[02:31:22.495 --> 02:31:24.056]  That's why I plug them, but thanks for the product plug.
[02:31:24.377 --> 02:31:25.077]  We got to get to Jay Dyer.
[02:31:25.157 --> 02:31:26.539]  You want to talk about God's plan for us?
[02:31:26.579 --> 02:31:26.839]  Go ahead.
[02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:44.354]  Yeah, I just think of God as like the tour bus driver, and we're on this bus, and I've had a bad experience with a tour bus driver on a cliffside, and I thought, this could be like, I think of Armageddon as like his mad, his mutually assured destruction policy.
[02:31:44.394 --> 02:31:49.936]  It's a threat that exists, but he never uses, and this is like to scare as many of us back into the flock.
[02:31:49.956 --> 02:31:56.680]  So you're saying Revelation is a possible future to not become a self-fulfilling prophecy, but to warn us not to do it?
[02:31:57.625 --> 02:32:05.287]  That's my, that, I'd like to think it, you know, it could go there if we want to really go there, but that ultimately, you know, this is... I think that's heavy.
[02:32:05.367 --> 02:32:06.687]  I think that's, I think that's deep.
[02:32:06.807 --> 02:32:08.307]  I think you're, I think that's powerful.
[02:32:10.127 --> 02:32:14.306]  And also, beyond that, well, I'd like to...
[02:32:14.306 --> 02:32:18.106]   about the Titan battle that you talked about recently, but then...
[02:32:18.106 --> 02:32:26.185]   I have an idea, I want to get in real quick about a fundraiser, sticker activism.
[02:32:26.185 --> 02:32:27.185]  If you had...
[02:32:27.185 --> 02:32:30.387]   How much do those little wads of the duct tape over your mouth stickers that you send
[02:32:30.387 --> 02:32:31.387]  free for a while cost?
[02:32:31.387 --> 02:32:35.106]   Yeah, we should do more sticker activism, so what's your idea?
[02:32:35.106 --> 02:32:40.707]  A monthly subscription of $5.95 or $9.95 or whatever the...
[02:32:40.789 --> 02:32:42.090]  And you get the latest stickers.
[02:32:42.130 --> 02:32:43.291]  That's a genius idea.
[02:32:43.351 --> 02:32:44.272]  We'll see if we can do it.
[02:32:44.933 --> 02:32:46.494]  A sticker subscription.
[02:32:46.955 --> 02:32:47.835]  That is beautiful.
[02:32:47.895 --> 02:32:48.276]  Thank you.
[02:32:48.556 --> 02:32:49.617]  I'm going to do that.
[02:32:50.278 --> 02:32:51.079]  Guys, write that down.
[02:32:51.119 --> 02:32:51.939]  Make sure I do that.
[02:32:52.340 --> 02:32:52.860]  Thank you, sir.
[02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:54.362]  We got to move because Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[02:32:54.802 --> 02:32:55.903]  Adam in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:32:55.923 --> 02:32:56.364]  You're on the air.
[02:32:57.697 --> 02:32:58.858]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:32:58.978 --> 02:33:04.342]  First off, I'd like to say thoughts and prayers to Owen, Brother Owen, and I stand with you, Alex, on the battlefield.
[02:33:05.142 --> 02:33:15.410]  What I wanted to call in about was all the foreign battlefronts that they're trying to create is one of the oldest tricks in the book.
[02:33:15.890 --> 02:33:23.755]  They want us to send, you know, a lot of our battle-ready troops abroad while they're building an army in our living room right here.
[02:33:23.775 --> 02:33:27.178]  Well, the oldest trick is multiple front wars.
[02:33:28.126 --> 02:33:29.527]  Yeah, and that's what they're doing.
[02:33:29.547 --> 02:33:34.289]  They're attacking us on every front, psychologically, and they're trying to go kinetic.
[02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:50.538]  So, the southern border is about getting their war, their soldiers in place, and hopefully we will be dumb enough to demand to send some of our bravest to go fight abroad and take that asset away from us when we need to be here defending the home front.
[02:33:50.959 --> 02:33:54.341]  With hundreds of thousands of military-age Islamic men in the country?
[02:33:55.601 --> 02:33:55.921]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:59.891 --> 02:34:10.696]  Harrison played a song this morning, Keep Your Gun In Your Hand, is a very good song that people can listen to to let them understand, you know, the temperature that we're facing.
[02:34:11.136 --> 02:34:13.037]  It's going to get real hot coming up this next year.
[02:34:13.117 --> 02:34:16.738]  So with that, I'll let you go and let you get the Jay Dyer and God bless.
[02:34:16.858 --> 02:34:17.539]  God bless you.
[02:34:17.599 --> 02:34:18.559]  Thanks for holding to say that.
[02:34:18.579 --> 02:34:19.900]  Yeah, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:23.802]  Last caller, Tone, then we'll skip the next couple of breaks so Jay gets his time.
[02:34:24.082 --> 02:34:25.462]  Tone in Florida, you're our tail gunner.
[02:34:25.482 --> 02:34:26.603]  Go ahead before Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:34:27.265 --> 02:34:30.246]  Thanks Alex, long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:34:31.747 --> 02:34:35.129]  I want to talk about the Maine event.
[02:34:35.989 --> 02:34:39.691]  I think you covered it very well, but I want to talk to you about why now.
[02:34:40.951 --> 02:34:51.856]  On October 19, 2023, Federal District Judge Roger Benitez struck down California's assault weapons ban, and they were pissed.
[02:34:52.196 --> 02:35:06.135]   Newsom, all the rest of the gun grabbers, And then one week later, they take this MKUltra off the shelf, and there's three articles in the Daily Mail about the shooter.
[02:35:07.176 --> 02:35:15.480]  And one is, they fitted him with hearing aids so he could hear other people criticizing him, and he shot four of his deaf friends.
[02:35:17.161 --> 02:35:24.364]  What I'd like to say is, I'm calling on all mental health workers, MKUltra programmers, to be a whistleblower.
[02:35:25.397 --> 02:35:27.338]  And expose this.
[02:35:28.258 --> 02:35:29.858]  Because too many innocent people have died.
[02:35:30.819 --> 02:35:31.399]  Well, that's right.
[02:35:31.479 --> 02:35:33.279]  Theodore Krasinski was MKUltra.
[02:35:33.339 --> 02:35:34.100]  A bunch of them were.
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:36.400]  It's not far-fetched to say he could have been.
[02:35:36.801 --> 02:35:37.641]  Perfect cut-out.
[02:35:37.821 --> 02:35:38.261]  Farmer.
[02:35:38.821 --> 02:35:39.441]  In the army.
[02:35:40.742 --> 02:35:41.642]  Shooting instructor.
[02:35:41.762 --> 02:35:42.942]  And then now this all happens.
[02:35:43.242 --> 02:35:43.783]  It looks bad.
[02:35:43.803 --> 02:35:48.104]  I don't think it's really about the Israeli war, even though they started invading today.
[02:35:49.224 --> 02:35:51.345]  I want to give you a commercial now for the Alexapeer.
[02:35:51.545 --> 02:35:53.866]  I had one and then I broke up my girlfriend.
[02:35:53.886 --> 02:35:58.226]   She demanded She'd keep it because it made the coffee really good.
[02:35:58.246 --> 02:36:00.687]  So I had to go buy another one for me.
[02:36:02.708 --> 02:36:04.909]  But let's go back to this real quick before Jay takes over.
[02:36:05.329 --> 02:36:05.930]  I saw that.
[02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:11.852]  Getting the hearing aids and they had voices and God knows what was going on and he was in a psychiatric facility.
[02:36:12.233 --> 02:36:18.215]  How many of these guys are in psychiatric facilities, in fact most of the shooters, and they let them go and they go do this after they're in a facility?
[02:36:18.856 --> 02:36:21.217]  Alex, you've covered this.
[02:36:21.277 --> 02:36:23.978]  I talked to all these people saying, look, this is programmed.
[02:36:24.611 --> 02:36:26.012]  They have a mental illness.
[02:36:26.672 --> 02:36:28.213]  They get treatment at a facility.
[02:36:28.673 --> 02:36:31.314]  They have prior law enforcement contact.
[02:36:31.914 --> 02:36:32.795]  They allow them out.
[02:36:33.895 --> 02:36:35.876]  They say they're going to do it, and then they do it.
[02:36:35.916 --> 02:36:36.676]  There's many of them.
[02:36:36.736 --> 02:36:37.817]  There's one in Alaska.
[02:36:37.837 --> 02:36:39.498]  There was one in Florida at the airport.
[02:36:40.698 --> 02:36:41.679]  The Parkland one.
[02:36:41.759 --> 02:36:43.439]  Why do they fit the same M.O.
[02:36:43.559 --> 02:36:44.460]  over and over again?
[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:45.780]  They're all the same.
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:47.001]  They're all on SSRIs.
[02:36:47.041 --> 02:36:47.741]  You've covered this.
[02:36:48.702 --> 02:36:51.103]  But somebody's been a whistleblower.
[02:36:52.523 --> 02:36:53.984]  Because somebody's programming them.
[02:36:55.751 --> 02:36:58.092]  Well, we know with the Batman shooter he was being programmed.
[02:36:58.532 --> 02:37:00.573]  Yeah, no, he was doing research on it.
[02:37:00.593 --> 02:37:02.994]  He was a master's degree student.
[02:37:03.014 --> 02:37:05.235]  He was in a mind-controlled NASA program.
[02:37:05.575 --> 02:37:07.596]  Yeah, yeah, no, he was a smart guy.
[02:37:07.616 --> 02:37:10.017]  And then look what happened to him.
[02:37:10.417 --> 02:37:11.777]  He tried to clear the corner of the screen.
[02:37:13.378 --> 02:37:15.959]  He was standing out there by himself when the cops came up to him.
[02:37:15.979 --> 02:37:20.861]  They thought he was a cop because he was all body armor and he didn't know where he was.
[02:37:22.813 --> 02:37:24.213]  Just like Sirhan Sirhan.
[02:37:24.233 --> 02:37:24.954]  Great point, Don.
[02:37:25.434 --> 02:37:27.374]  What incredible callers today.
[02:37:27.394 --> 02:37:31.755]  Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, bestselling author, takes over now.
[02:37:34.056 --> 02:37:36.717]  Thank you for letting me host the fourth hour, Alex.
[02:37:36.737 --> 02:37:37.477]  Appreciate that.
[02:37:37.517 --> 02:37:38.217]  Glad to be here.
[02:37:38.237 --> 02:37:44.159]  I want to talk about World War III, the coming socialist dictatorship.
[02:37:44.579 --> 02:37:45.419]  Yes, that's right.
[02:37:46.019 --> 02:37:59.669]   And how a lot of what we're seeing might fit into the overall plans of the technocratic elite to move us into their technocratic global governance, which I think is best titled corporate socialism.
[02:38:01.129 --> 02:38:04.191]  Or we could call it scientific socialism, scientific governance.
[02:38:04.311 --> 02:38:24.733]   But corporate socialism is good because it really merges monopoly capitalism with not so much classical Marxism, which didn't achieve what they wanted to achieve with it, But rather, socialism, Fabian socialism, that slow approach model, which has been very successful, that the elite have used, that's the real strategy.
[02:38:24.774 --> 02:38:29.497]  And so we want to look through some of the plans that they've had, how effective they've been.
[02:38:29.517 --> 02:38:35.401]  And if we understand that, we might be able to stop some of their future plans.
[02:38:35.441 --> 02:38:48.143]   And I don't know if we're going to stop World War Three, or if there'll be World War Three, but if there is, We know that it's for the purpose of a dialectical outcome of a new order of the ages that emerges out of these dialectical conflicts.
[02:38:48.883 --> 02:39:10.637]   And one thing that might emerge that I think not many people have talked about is if there is a Middle Eastern war and if there is a war that breaks out as a result of not just Ukraine and Russia, but Israel versus Palestine, the Arab world, the Muslim world, Then it might be then cast as, look at nationalism.
[02:39:11.158 --> 02:39:18.585]  You see, because Jews are an ancient biblical notion of a nation-state, nationalism is part of the problem, you see.
[02:39:19.385 --> 02:39:41.008]   Now that's my own speculation that they might demonize it, but one of the reasons that Klaus and company have consistently said, there's going to be an angrier world, an angrier world because of the conflicts and because of the The bio weapons and because of the wars and because of the economic collapses that are coming, the food shortages, all this stuff that we saw a taste of in the last three years.
[02:39:42.008 --> 02:39:45.669]  What ended up being kind of the scapegoat?
[02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:52.371]  And what was the scapegoat that was mentioned in the Rockefeller document, the lockstep document?
[02:39:52.451 --> 02:40:00.713]  Well, one of the scapegoats was the inadequacies and the lack of capabilities of national governments to solve their own problems.
[02:40:01.448 --> 02:40:14.139]  Which solution is then offered as the design solution of an international body, which is able to then adjudicate and divvy up and solve the problems, solve the economic issues.
[02:40:14.159 --> 02:40:22.407]  So there's always this assumption that greater centralization will be able to somehow solve the localized problems.
[02:40:22.467 --> 02:40:26.955]   Of course, Just because you centralize all the power doesn't necessarily mean the problems are going to be solved.
[02:40:26.975 --> 02:40:30.556]  In fact, you're just giving over more and more power to these centralized bodies.
[02:40:30.616 --> 02:40:42.822]  So let's look at the older, older plan that the technocratic global con men planned out about 170 years ago.
[02:40:42.942 --> 02:40:46.678]   So we'll go back to the first plan that we had that We know about it.
[02:40:46.698 --> 02:40:54.641]  There was an older plan with Adam Weishaupt and his plan for Illuminism, which was an earlier proto form of communism.
[02:40:54.681 --> 02:40:56.021]  That's not conspiracy theory.
[02:40:56.041 --> 02:41:00.063]  That's mainline history from Firing the Minds of Men by James Billington.
[02:41:00.623 --> 02:41:08.986]  But the next phase of that was a rewritten plan that Karl Marx wrote when he was in this little secret society called the League of the Just.
[02:41:09.713 --> 02:41:14.740]  And they said, hey, Carl, buddy, you got a giant atheistic beard there.
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.026]  We want you to write for us a manifesto.
[02:41:19.326 --> 02:41:23.012]  And so Carl wrote a famous manifesto with planks.
[02:41:24.033 --> 02:41:26.737]  And I want to go through some of these planks and then talk about where it failed.
[02:41:27.546 --> 02:41:36.277]  But where it's succeeding and then how that plan was reconstituted and then put into a different strategy some years later.
[02:41:36.817 --> 02:41:42.044]  So the 1st plank was the abolition of property and land of all rents.
[02:41:42.685 --> 02:41:44.165]  Of land to public purpose.
[02:41:44.205 --> 02:41:46.726]  So basically the abolition of private property, right?
[02:41:47.166 --> 02:42:03.190]  And the abolition of private property is important because in their view, really the only way to manage society is if you have this quasi central, basically this technocratic control system that's totally centralized from the top down.
[02:42:03.955 --> 02:42:12.170]  And they begin with this in various countries, but then eventually it's intended to be international, right?
[02:42:12.190 --> 02:42:18.940]   So the idea is that everything that's holding back mankind is The barriers like family and nation.
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:21.801]  Those are things that hold us back from progress.
[02:42:21.842 --> 02:42:33.789]  Of course, we don't know what we're progressing to, except that Marx says, well, there'll be a withering away of the state in a future golden age, and machines will do all the work, and we'll all basically be free.
[02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:34.670]  We'll be libertarian.
[02:42:34.690 --> 02:42:38.433]  Some people don't know this, but Marx's final stage was actually libertarianism.
[02:42:38.473 --> 02:42:44.937]  It was the idea that the governments of the world would all wither away, and everybody would have total freedom.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:47.361]  He says you can go out and paint a picture.
[02:42:47.401 --> 02:42:51.883]  You can go and fish and do whatever you want when we get the final revolution.
[02:42:53.464 --> 02:43:07.850]  So successful in the abolition of all property, but they were successful in getting certain nations and especially throughout the West to begin to pass laws, which would severely limit public or private ownership.
[02:43:08.297 --> 02:43:11.979]  Laws like eminent domain, these kinds of things, are socialist ideas.
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:18.944]  And in the countries where they tried these communes, of course it failed, but they were able to begin to do this.
[02:43:19.524 --> 02:43:27.491]   But notice that the failure was the attempt to pass this Through in terms of local communal organizers, right?
[02:43:27.531 --> 02:43:44.506]  The local communist boss or whatever trying to run these communal farms or whatever and they they didn't realize at that stage that maybe there would be better ways to manage these these communes and these, you know, quasi socialist.
[02:43:46.690 --> 02:43:52.518]  Ways of living that would later be solved via technocracy and smart cities.
[02:43:52.798 --> 02:43:53.779]  And I'm not, I'm not joking.
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:44:01.229]  So, what the Marxist socialists were talking about in the 1850s, this kind of failed.
[02:44:02.010 --> 02:44:04.633]  But now we're actually going into where they wanted to go.
[02:44:05.347 --> 02:44:08.368]  Number two, a heavy progressive graduated income tax.
[02:44:08.408 --> 02:44:12.609]  Of course, the IRS and all of this is the total manifestation of this.
[02:44:12.629 --> 02:44:17.330]  So they were very successful in getting this through as well as the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:44:17.350 --> 02:44:25.852]  People don't realize that the Federal Reserve Bank is actually something that's akin to a more of a Marxist idea of how you would run the society.
[02:44:25.872 --> 02:44:34.334]  And that's why the next plank or the two planks later is the centralization of all banking or credit into the hands of the state.
[02:44:35.174 --> 02:44:40.376]  And by means of a national state capital and exclusive monopoly via this state bank.
[02:44:40.876 --> 02:44:51.020]  Now, we have that essentially with the privately run Federal Reserve and somebody might say, well that's not communist if it's run by a private entity, if it's run by a bunch of private individuals.
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:58.663]  Oh, but you see Marxism was always about private individuals running these things with this cloak of humanitarianism.
[02:44:58.703 --> 02:45:03.225]  That's why Marxism was always funded by and run by the wealthiest people out there.
[02:45:05.057 --> 02:45:08.940]  But the third plank was the abolition of all rights of inheritance.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:10.501]  Now, we haven't gotten that yet.
[02:45:10.901 --> 02:45:11.882]  They haven't gotten that yet.
[02:45:11.902 --> 02:45:12.502]  I don't say we.
[02:45:12.542 --> 02:45:14.263]  People say, oh, Clippett, he's one of the marches.
[02:45:14.904 --> 02:45:20.588]  They haven't gotten that yet, but we're going into that because we do have pretty heavy taxes on inheritance in the West.
[02:45:22.210 --> 02:45:33.593]  Anybody that fled countries or tried to flee Marxist communist countries would immediately have their property confiscated and thus anybody who rebelled against the system would be deplatformed.
[02:45:33.713 --> 02:45:35.174]  I wonder, have we seen any of that?
[02:45:35.194 --> 02:45:36.554]  Yes, we're beginning to see that.
[02:45:37.034 --> 02:45:49.738]  So notice that the Fortune 100, Fortune 500 technocrat system, which a lot of people mistake for being purely a capitalist system, is corporate communism.
[02:45:50.629 --> 02:45:51.449]  Corporate socialism.
[02:45:51.529 --> 02:45:53.010]  It's both of these things, you see.
[02:45:53.571 --> 02:45:57.653]  Because the corporations themselves, they run on the stock market.
[02:45:57.733 --> 02:45:59.734]  They have, you know, they're publicly traded companies.
[02:46:00.574 --> 02:46:02.255]  They run on the dollar.
[02:46:03.656 --> 02:46:09.059]  But they're also private companies with key government interface.
[02:46:09.279 --> 02:46:14.902]  And so they're given a lot of, a lot of these startups were given CIA front company In-Q-Tel money, right?
[02:46:14.962 --> 02:46:18.143]  Like, I think, Google, Facebook, right?
[02:46:18.644 --> 02:46:27.663]   So, It's a private-public-private partnership that is more accurately kind of a corporate socialism than it is something like communism.
[02:46:29.163 --> 02:46:32.024]  So we've seen a few of these planks already in place.
[02:46:32.104 --> 02:46:38.745]  The centralized Federal Reserve fiat system, a debt-based system, that is actually a plank of the Communist Party which is in place.
[02:46:38.805 --> 02:46:40.026]  And it's not just in the U.S.
[02:46:40.166 --> 02:46:45.247]  The intended IMF World Bank system is itself a Fabian socialist system.
[02:46:45.797 --> 02:46:50.003]  So, the Bank for National Settlements is also the central bank of central banks.
[02:46:50.083 --> 02:46:54.088]  It's sort of the Federal Reserve Bank for the world, and you could say it's basically the same model.
[02:46:54.108 --> 02:46:55.370]  So, that they did get through.
[02:46:56.512 --> 02:47:00.978]  The centralization of all communication and transport to be run by the state.
[02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:04.691]  I would say that we're pretty far down that plank.
[02:47:04.791 --> 02:47:16.555]  It's not totally there, but the corporate state or the corporate socialist state that we live under, it's almost there at least when it comes to shutting down anybody who dissents.
[02:47:17.235 --> 02:47:22.357]  The censorship that we've seen in the last few years, this is the sixth plank of the Communist Party.
[02:47:23.257 --> 02:47:24.018]  It's kind of there.
[02:47:25.118 --> 02:47:29.989]   But remember, or they're at least trying to put it in more and more, Remember that this is the failed plan.
[02:47:30.169 --> 02:47:38.091]  So this is the original 1848 planks of the Communist Party that Marx wrote for the League of the Just.
[02:47:38.871 --> 02:47:40.612]  And a lot of this didn't succeed.
[02:47:40.712 --> 02:47:49.734]  And so the socialist Marxists went back to the drawing board and said, let's re-strategize and figure out a different plan.
[02:47:50.740 --> 02:48:12.017]  But a lot of this they did get through, not so much at the time, because when they tried to force this stuff in, in the Marxist revolution, the Red Terror and all that, a lot of this just didn't work because it was so absurd and idealistic and the expectations were that the working class, the proletariat was going to cause all this and bring about this revolution.
[02:48:12.961 --> 02:48:16.283]  Nobody in the proletariat cares about all of Marx's theory of values.
[02:48:16.303 --> 02:48:18.645]  They're not going to read his boring-ass Das Kapital.
[02:48:18.965 --> 02:48:20.866]  They want, you know, cigarette breaks.
[02:48:20.906 --> 02:48:21.667]  They want lunch breaks.
[02:48:21.687 --> 02:48:22.607]  They don't care about this stuff.
[02:48:23.468 --> 02:48:26.810]  And so, again, I had to go back to the drawing board.
[02:48:28.491 --> 02:48:32.814]  Number seven was that the state would take over all of the factories.
[02:48:33.507 --> 02:48:42.349]  Now, we don't have overt taking over of all of the corporate world, but you have that public-private partnership, which is essentially the same thing.
[02:48:42.429 --> 02:48:56.773]  Again, whether it's a single corporation running everything like a company town, or whether it's a gigantic centralized government, just think of the communist government or a Soviet-style government, just think of it as the only corporation.
[02:48:57.954 --> 02:49:00.655]  And it's no different than all the other corporations, you see.
[02:49:00.855 --> 02:49:02.295]  So, corporate socialism.
[02:49:03.894 --> 02:49:08.918]  The next plank was equality of labor, or excuse me, equality of liability of all to labor.
[02:49:08.958 --> 02:49:10.419]  So everybody has a right to work.
[02:49:10.579 --> 02:49:23.528]  Everybody has the ability to, you know, I guess equality of outcome as well as a logical conclusion of this, which all of which is absurd because even Marx admitted that some people are more equipped for certain jobs and can get more work done.
[02:49:23.948 --> 02:49:28.231]  Yeah, we have the equality of outcome for, I mean, it's just it just makes no sense, right?
[02:49:29.552 --> 02:49:58.995]   And even though we don't exactly have that yet, We're beginning to see through a lot of the CRT a lot of the woke stuff a lot of the Lowering of standards for graduation for education at all levels Calling education racist racism calling math racist all the stuff that they're pushing It has the effect of doing what that plank was intended to do The ninth plank was the combination of all agriculture and manufacturing and the abolition between
[02:50:00.032 --> 02:50:03.156]  Distribution of the population in the country and in the cities.
[02:50:03.716 --> 02:50:14.608]  So you can't have country people being kind of self-sufficient and on their own and all of these city soy bug men that are deracinated and have to worship the state.
[02:50:14.968 --> 02:50:20.975]  You got to have everybody packed into cities and equally distribute this or have an equal distribution of the city people into the country.
[02:50:21.756 --> 02:50:41.850]  And this again has the effect of destroying people's livelihood and structure of life in the country to make it more metropolitan and to get them to adopt and to likewise to get people in the city who might be, say, in New York attached to Wall Street, right, to get them attached to more agrarian communal ideas.
[02:50:42.891 --> 02:50:48.294]  And, you know, if you remember when Alex went to New York a year or two ago, whenever that was, and there was the U.N.
[02:50:48.374 --> 02:50:54.398]   billboards Outside describing the type of life that you would have in the smart city.
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:57.082]  It would be this communal.
[02:50:57.102 --> 02:51:03.253]  I mean, it gets very much like the older experiments and communal living that the Marxist socialists tried to do.
[02:51:04.346 --> 02:51:11.749]  Number 10 plank was the free education for all via public schools, but of course the public schools are the indoctrination system.
[02:51:12.309 --> 02:51:19.432]  So they're not actually interested in giving all the workers education and giving them the ability to read, write, and do arithmetic.
[02:51:19.512 --> 02:51:35.399]   No, the education system is intended eventually to become, this is a generation after Marx, A socializing institution, and this is what Horace Mann, John Dewey, all these different figures that dreamt up the American public education system.
[02:51:35.439 --> 02:51:40.381]  They said it would be the socializing tool to bring about the socialist world order.
[02:51:40.441 --> 02:51:46.764]  They explicitly said that a lot of the woman involved in the invention of kindergarten, her name is Peabody.
[02:51:47.144 --> 02:51:53.207]  She said that kindergarten and socialist education would bring a new Pentecost to the world, literally.
[02:51:53.247 --> 02:51:54.928]  She saw it in a religious sense.
[02:51:55.731 --> 02:51:56.852]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:56.892 --> 02:51:57.432]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:51:58.093 --> 02:52:09.862]  We will be back in just a second as we cover the ten planks of the Communist Party and then how they had to reorganize it to bring about the technocratic order.
[02:52:10.182 --> 02:52:12.103]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:12.123 --> 02:52:20.770]  We're talking about the history of the attempt to bring in a scientific socialist government or a scientific dictatorship.
[02:52:21.471 --> 02:52:36.888]  Corporate socialism and the reason that we have to understand that is that you really can't make sense of all the stuff that's happening and what's happened in the 20th century with the two world wars in the Cold War without understanding this game plan without understanding this.
[02:52:37.734 --> 02:52:56.863]  Pagalian dialectical conflict and synthesis, which really undergirds the whole process of the way that the Milner Fabian elites, Lord Rothschild, Lord Salisbury, Lord Cecil, all of these different characters, Lord Curtis, who were involved in Ruskin, Twainby, H.G.
[02:52:56.903 --> 02:53:05.827]  Wells, all these Royal Society elites who had this idea to use socialism as a better means than Marxism.
[02:53:06.374 --> 02:53:25.881]  So even though the elite were in many ways behind funding Marxism from its inception, even Engels himself was a wealthy stock owner who kind of helped Marx just kind of mooch and lay around and be lazy and write a bunch of nonsense, it actually ended up being a very interesting technology for destroying societies.
[02:53:26.733 --> 02:53:35.056]  And when the original Marxist plan for the revolution didn't really work, so they had a few phases of early revolutions, as you may or may not know.
[02:53:35.076 --> 02:53:39.897]  You know, the French Revolution was basically a Marxist kind of revolution with the Jacobins.
[02:53:40.577 --> 02:53:43.838]  And then you get Marx coming on the scene, as we said, in the mid-1800s.
[02:53:43.858 --> 02:53:47.700]  And then you get some revolutions in the 1800s.
[02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:53.321]  But the real flowering of that revolution was, of course, the Bolshevik Revolution, right?
[02:53:53.621 --> 02:54:00.138]   That was the next phase of this really Intense, hardcore, terror-using, Red Terror Revolution.
[02:54:00.658 --> 02:54:10.304]  And the reason for that is that many of these Marxists, I think, not only were they just completely demonically possessed, but the Paris Commune, for example, engaged in Red Terror.
[02:54:11.465 --> 02:54:18.890]  That's where Leon Trotsky got this idea for Red Terror from the Paris Commune.
[02:54:19.821 --> 02:54:31.548]  And then engaged in all kinds of means and methodologies which intended to rip apart the previous society, completely demolish it, so that you could have corporate socialism set up.
[02:54:31.588 --> 02:54:39.834]  And I call it corporate socialism because as we've seen from Professor Anthony Sutton's works, the Bolshevik Revolution was completely funded by the elites in the West.
[02:54:40.414 --> 02:54:46.428]   And so, this then led to people in England saying, well, Is this going to work?
[02:54:46.968 --> 02:54:50.311]  We have the Fabian Society essentially supporting the Bolsheviks.
[02:54:51.031 --> 02:55:03.281]  Beatrice Webb wrote letters to Lenin's wife Kripskaya very glowingly saying, we love your Bolshevik revolution, we support it, we hope it's successful because we want to see scientific governance.
[02:55:04.031 --> 02:55:19.624]  And if you remember when we had our friend Rachel Wilson on in her book, she covered the figure of Alexandra Kollontai, who at that time was writing a lot of books and articles about how the way to bring in the international order would be to destroy the family.
[02:55:20.404 --> 02:55:26.749]  And along with destroying the family, you've got to also destroy the nation state, because the nation state is kind of an extension of the family.
[02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:35.150]   And all of those are accurately seen by the socialist Marxists as roadblocks to the global order.
[02:55:36.291 --> 02:55:49.940]  But what not many people have understood is the power of monopoly capital to build the order and the infrastructure that the socialists themselves said they would take over.
[02:55:51.381 --> 02:55:54.023]  So the only way, and they actually say this, right?
[02:55:54.323 --> 02:55:54.483]  H.G.
[02:55:54.503 --> 02:55:55.124]  Wells said it.
[02:55:56.144 --> 02:55:58.266]  If you read the Ratiu book, he covers it.
[02:55:58.326 --> 02:56:10.353]   Very few people have stumbled onto this, that Some of the smarter inner party Marxists figured out that Marxism itself doesn't have the ability to build a gigantic infrastructure.
[02:56:10.473 --> 02:56:13.034]  The energy and power of capitalism does.
[02:56:13.214 --> 02:56:19.758]  It can build, you know, this global order that's, you know, rivals Atlantis, right?
[02:56:19.798 --> 02:56:27.382]  With its advances and its, you know, you know, technology and, you know, amazing inventions like Bitcoin, all this kind of stuff, right?
[02:56:28.002 --> 02:56:29.943]  None of that comes out of socialism Marxism.
[02:56:30.885 --> 02:56:43.770]  But what socialism, Marxism does as a technology is that it's very useful in terms of infecting, subverting, and turning a nation over to an internationalist power structure.
[02:56:44.270 --> 02:56:46.251]  It consolidates wealth and power.
[02:56:46.687 --> 02:56:48.768]  And transfers that wealth and power offshore.
[02:56:48.948 --> 02:56:50.048]  That's all it does.
[02:56:50.528 --> 02:56:51.789]  And it's very effective at that.
[02:56:52.249 --> 02:56:54.869]  And very wealthy, smart people and cunning people know that.
[02:56:55.410 --> 02:57:02.072]  Dumb people on the street think that they're actually going to get a universal basic income and they're going to get to live in their coon pods.
[02:57:02.092 --> 02:57:03.052]  And that's not what you get.
[02:57:03.192 --> 02:57:04.032]  You don't get any of that.
[02:57:04.972 --> 02:57:09.934]  This is a technocratic order that ultimately has the design of mass depopulation.
[02:57:10.658 --> 02:57:26.967]  And so a lot of this we've already covered, so I don't want to rehearse all the old stuff, but I'm happy to say that a book that has long been out of print that independently vindicates everything that we've covered in this great book is Dr. John Coleman's other book.
[02:57:27.027 --> 02:57:28.668]  We covered the Committee of 300, but guess what?
[02:57:28.688 --> 02:57:30.829]  He has another book that he wrote.
[02:57:30.929 --> 02:57:38.833]  The former British intelligence analyst, Dr. John Coleman, wrote One World Order, the Socialist Dictatorship.
[02:57:40.561 --> 02:57:46.326]  And so, although it's probably out of print now because I've been mentioning it on my live streams every time I mention a book, it sells out.
[02:57:47.067 --> 02:57:57.996]  You might be able to find a copy on Amazon, I don't know, but the thesis of his book is great because independent from Ratu and all these other texts, he's coming to the same conclusion that Professor Sutton came to.
[02:57:59.158 --> 02:58:01.580]  The same conclusions that other researchers have come to.
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:06.404]  And that is that the enemy in the Cold War wasn't actually Moscow.
[02:58:08.175 --> 02:58:23.065]  And people thought that, oh, well, if we focus everything on, you know, fixing Stalin and fixing Soviet problems and all this, then we'll finally be able to, you know, breathe free and the world can be free and we can get rid of the evil empire and all that.
[02:58:23.625 --> 02:58:30.029]  But as many people who really dig into this research discover, the enemy was actually in Washington.
[02:58:30.450 --> 02:58:32.491]  And I don't mean it's just the federal government.
[02:58:32.591 --> 02:58:32.851]  No, no, no.
[02:58:33.172 --> 02:58:36.434]  The corporate 100, corporate fortune one, fortune 100, fortune 500.
[02:58:37.902 --> 02:58:57.112]  The banking elites, that's the real power structure and they are allied together in that Anglo-American Atlanticist establishment power structure, which includes Israel as well, in that they would like to set up an eventual technocratic world socialist dictatorship.
[02:58:59.313 --> 02:59:03.016]   And they intend to do this via certain strategies and means.
[02:59:03.396 --> 02:59:05.896]  Now, we mentioned the Ten Planks of the Communist Party.
[02:59:06.457 --> 02:59:09.398]  Some of those they were successful in, some of them weren't so successful.
[02:59:10.058 --> 02:59:28.483]  But they also have another list that they came up with after the Fabian Socialists saw the inadequacies of first Marx's plan, the Ten Planks, and then the actual Bolshevik Revolution, where it succeeded, where it failed from their vantage point.
[02:59:28.944 --> 02:59:30.244]  So they went back to the drawing board.
[02:59:31.388 --> 02:59:49.196]  And when they went back to the drawing board, they came up with what we call Fabian Socialism, which is this slow approach model, not the overnight worker revolution, but a slow model of gradually bringing in each of these planks, but they're kind of reorganized.
[02:59:49.736 --> 02:59:53.097]  And so the Fabians came up with a plan and they wrote it up.
[02:59:54.398 --> 02:59:57.059]  And this was their plan back in the days of Woodrow Wilson.
[02:59:57.919 --> 03:00:06.365]  Under which we had World War I, via the machinations of British intelligence and Colonel Edwin Mandel House, and under which we got the Federal Reserve.
[03:00:07.005 --> 03:00:17.832]  So, big key plans there, sending nations to war, to bankrupt them, to get them involved in an international order, out of which came the League of Nations.
[03:00:17.932 --> 03:00:21.854]  And the League of Nations was drawn up by Fabian Socialist to create a Fabian Socialist order.
[03:00:22.215 --> 03:00:24.816]  Now the League of Nations failed in its ultimate goal.
[03:00:25.056 --> 03:00:28.559]   They didn't get what they really wanted from The League of Nations.
[03:00:28.619 --> 03:00:39.188]  However, at the time, according to Dr. Coleman, they drew up plans of a revamped, revitalized version of Marx's planks.
[03:00:39.288 --> 03:00:42.011]  They said, all right, let's not go with Marx's ten planks.
[03:00:42.291 --> 03:00:50.278]  Let's revamp this and let's come up with seven points that the Fabian Socialists had to take down the United States of America.
[03:00:50.299 --> 03:00:51.780]  And why would they want to take it down?
[03:00:52.324 --> 03:00:52.844]  Why wouldn't they want?
[03:00:52.964 --> 03:01:01.547]  Well, by taking it down, they mean retooling it and repurposing it for international socialist order objectives.
[03:01:02.168 --> 03:01:04.748]  So it doesn't mean completely destroying the country.
[03:01:04.828 --> 03:01:08.710]  It means turning it into something other than it has been.
[03:01:09.870 --> 03:01:11.491]  And they've been very successful in that.
[03:01:12.031 --> 03:01:27.168]   And if we understand this Fabian socialist model and plan, We actually can give context and meaning to a lot of the conflicts, a lot of the events that have been happening in the last century and where we are today in America, 2023.
[03:01:27.868 --> 03:01:30.570]  I mean, this thesis makes sense.
[03:01:30.630 --> 03:01:31.890]  It makes sense of a lot of these things.
[03:01:32.811 --> 03:01:37.713]  It makes sense of why it doesn't matter which people you elect, this plan marches forward.
[03:01:39.914 --> 03:01:47.227]   And I'm not trying to break everybody's wills or make you be blackmailed, but We have to see that this is who's really running things, right?
[03:01:48.048 --> 03:01:50.349]  And remember when Ron Paul talked about the Federal Reserve?
[03:01:50.369 --> 03:01:51.970]  Has everybody just forgotten the Federal Reserve?
[03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:53.391]  I mean, Trump at least talked about it some.
[03:01:53.411 --> 03:01:58.335]  He wanted to take actions at least according to some of his campaign talk against the Federal Reserve.
[03:01:59.346 --> 03:02:01.126]  Nobody even thinks or talks about the Federal Reserve.
[03:02:01.166 --> 03:02:02.307]  Have we just forgotten about this?
[03:02:02.427 --> 03:02:04.067]  I mean, that's still running the country.
[03:02:04.247 --> 03:02:12.089]  That's still why, right, we lose our purchasing power and we lose all of our, you know, the dollar's fiat.
[03:02:12.249 --> 03:02:14.229]  It's going to nothing, right, eventually.
[03:02:17.730 --> 03:02:26.809]   But we just forget about that because we're entertained by the next Thing on the news, this person, this mass event or whatever, or, oh, there's going to be a new conflict here or there.
[03:02:26.829 --> 03:02:33.973]  The news just dominates everybody's focus and attention in a very effective way to forget the real issues.
[03:02:34.794 --> 03:02:34.994]  Right?
[03:02:35.254 --> 03:02:38.076]  Fortune 100, Fortune 500, big banks, Federal Reserve.
[03:02:38.236 --> 03:02:39.337]  That's what controls the country.
[03:02:42.339 --> 03:02:49.751]   So what were the Fabian Socialist seven point plans, the retooled plan that they came up with Under the Wilson Administration.
[03:02:49.791 --> 03:02:56.373]  And remember, not too long after this, you get FDR, who pushes the New Deal, all drawn up by Fabian Socialists.
[03:02:58.033 --> 03:03:10.555]  Well, the number one plank for the new revamped Fabian Plan was, we must overcome, not completely destroy the way the Bolsheviks did, but to permeate and penetrate the Christian religion.
[03:03:12.316 --> 03:03:13.036]  What did Klaus say?
[03:03:13.056 --> 03:03:14.356]  It would penetrate the Communists.
[03:03:14.986 --> 03:03:18.288]  Klaus is saying the Fabian Socialist strategy.
[03:03:18.988 --> 03:03:20.129]  Permeate and penetrate.
[03:03:21.389 --> 03:03:26.172]  That means take over the institutions, not destroy them like Lenin tried to do.
[03:03:26.292 --> 03:03:28.713]  I'll just completely destroy the church, tear them all down.
[03:03:29.313 --> 03:03:29.853]  That didn't work.
[03:03:32.095 --> 03:03:39.338]  But what they found was much more effective was to create international institutions like the World Council of Churches, National Council of Churches.
[03:03:40.839 --> 03:03:57.000]   Originally before that they had what they called the The Faith Forum or something like that, that was sort of the proto One World Religion movement that was going on in the 1920s and 30s that eventually would morph into the Rockefeller-funded World Council of Churches, National Council of Churches.
[03:03:57.580 --> 03:04:04.886]  And so this strategy was self-conscious on the part of these very wealthy people and their friends in the Fabian Society.
[03:04:04.926 --> 03:04:14.088]   And amazingly, Beatrice Webb, George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, these Fabian Socialists, ideologues, They got a bunch of money from the British elite.
[03:04:14.568 --> 03:04:23.510]  They were also successful in convincing a bunch of very wealthy American industrialists and entrepreneurs to put a bunch of money into their stuff, too.
[03:04:23.650 --> 03:04:28.571]  They impressed Henry Ford, they impressed David Rockefeller, and a host of other.
[03:04:29.712 --> 03:04:36.333]  Laura Spellman, Rockefeller Fund, she gave tens of millions of dollars to feminist Fabian socialists.
[03:04:36.673 --> 03:04:38.853]  And yes, all the Fabian socialists were feminists.
[03:04:39.353 --> 03:04:40.294]  So there's an alliance there.
[03:04:40.314 --> 03:04:41.774]  They're all part of the same plan.
[03:04:43.197 --> 03:04:47.522]  In fact, the entire feminist movement in America all comes from Fabian Socialists.
[03:04:47.622 --> 03:04:48.342]  Literally, all of it.
[03:04:49.243 --> 03:04:51.906]  And Dr. Coleman has an old chapter on all those women.
[03:04:52.647 --> 03:04:53.648]  Colentai, one of these.
[03:04:53.948 --> 03:04:55.610]  You can also read Rachel's book.
[03:04:55.650 --> 03:04:56.691]  She covers the same topic.
[03:04:56.731 --> 03:05:06.441]  Now, so permeating and destroying Christianity from within, not completely getting rid of it, but turning it into something that's a tool of the One World State.
[03:05:08.505 --> 03:05:23.169]  And you have to do that because to level all the religions and make them essentially all kind of on the same spectrum, they're all, we all believe in the same God, there's just one sort of generic God, and all the religions are pointing to that, right, which is kind of a Freemasonic idea.
[03:05:23.729 --> 03:05:31.171]  This is the obstacle that they wanted to overcome through permeation and penetration, through institutional capture.
[03:05:33.012 --> 03:05:44.536]  And now you see, of course, the Vatican pushing that very thing with the Abrahamic faith house, all the world religions together, or at least the Abrahamic religions, where Paul says that you're not in the Abrahamic religion without Christ.
[03:05:44.596 --> 03:05:48.117]  There is no such thing as being in the Abrahamic faith without faith in Christ.
[03:05:48.137 --> 03:05:51.398]  Jesus says in John 5, Abraham saw my day, right?
[03:05:51.758 --> 03:05:52.378]  He worshipped me.
[03:05:53.278 --> 03:05:54.419]  Moses believed in me.
[03:05:54.879 --> 03:06:01.361]  There's no Abrahamic tradition, if you're a Christian, without Jesus, without the Trinity.
[03:06:01.880 --> 03:06:06.601]  So that doesn't exist, this idea that, oh, well, we all have the same monotheistic Abrahamic faith.
[03:06:07.621 --> 03:06:09.541]  Not unless you want to reject the New Testament.
[03:06:10.702 --> 03:06:12.862]  Number two, national pride of nation-states.
[03:06:12.902 --> 03:06:18.763]  This was the second key plank in the Fabian Socialist seven-point plank that had to be destroyed.
[03:06:18.803 --> 03:06:30.565]  And that's because, as we said, pride in your nation-state is connected to your heritage, to your tradition, to your family, and in America, typically to Christianity, or some form of Christianity for the most part.
[03:06:32.043 --> 03:06:37.247]  And so number one is that religion and Christianity had to be destroyed, especially permeated from within.
[03:06:37.427 --> 03:06:39.309]  Destroyed does not mean totally getting rid of it.
[03:06:39.649 --> 03:06:47.555]  It means turning it into a tool for soft power for global elites to get people into this nascent one world religion.
[03:06:48.476 --> 03:06:50.357]  The national pride has to go away.
[03:06:50.758 --> 03:06:51.719]  And we're at that point.
[03:06:51.819 --> 03:06:52.019]  Right.
[03:06:52.079 --> 03:06:53.400]  So we've seen point one.
[03:06:53.660 --> 03:07:08.441]   Yes, they're very they very much permeated all the Institutions that go by the name of Christianity, Protestant, Roman Catholic, even in the Orthodox world they've achieved permeation to push these kinds of agendas.
[03:07:09.301 --> 03:07:15.342]   And we've also seen the decline in belief and pride in your own nation state.
[03:07:15.342 --> 03:07:18.381]   In a lot of places in the US, now you can't put up the American flag,
[03:07:18.381 --> 03:07:19.621]  they call it racist.
[03:07:19.621 --> 03:07:22.301]  That's exactly what the Fabian socialists wanted.
[03:07:22.301 --> 03:07:27.610]   And they were actually pretty ahead of their time in saying, we gotta weaponize all this term of calling everything
[03:07:27.610 --> 03:07:28.261]  racist.
[03:07:28.261 --> 03:07:32.261]   That was a Fabian socialist idea they came up with in the 1920s.
[03:07:32.261 --> 03:07:35.301]  So they were even way ahead of critical race theory stuff.
[03:07:35.301 --> 03:07:42.582]   They were pushing the woke stuff at the same time, or decades before anybody in the Marxist sphere was pushing it.
[03:07:42.582 --> 03:07:52.582]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:07:43.847 --> 03:07:45.088]  And again, you can see why.
[03:07:45.168 --> 03:07:48.112]  In order to have an international order, you've got to get rid of nation-states.
[03:07:49.253 --> 03:07:51.336]  Nations, people groups, don't exist.
[03:07:52.381 --> 03:07:58.026]  And one way you partly get rid of that is by mixing and flooding all the cultures with foreign cultures.
[03:07:58.126 --> 03:07:59.707]  This is called demographic warfare.
[03:07:59.727 --> 03:08:02.330]  It has nothing to do with, quote, being racist per se.
[03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:04.471]  It's an actual strategy of warfare.
[03:08:04.571 --> 03:08:09.976]  Kelly Greenhalgh from, I think, Stanford, one of the big Army War Colleges, there's books written on this.
[03:08:10.496 --> 03:08:14.960]  So there's actual military books on this, but you can't talk about it because it's supposed to be racist.
[03:08:15.861 --> 03:08:18.083]  But it's, I mean, just look up Kelly Greenhalgh's book.
[03:08:20.376 --> 03:08:24.358]  So, to get rid of the nation-state prepares for the international order.
[03:08:25.259 --> 03:08:25.919]  Patriotism.
[03:08:26.319 --> 03:08:27.100]  Patriotism is another thing.
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:30.102]  You can't have pride or the desire to self-defend.
[03:08:30.142 --> 03:08:30.722]  And guess what?
[03:08:31.202 --> 03:08:34.724]  Many of the Fabian socialists were first pushing.
[03:08:35.205 --> 03:08:41.108]  They were some of the pioneer groups to push in the 1890s, 1900s, 1910s, and 20s.
[03:08:41.808 --> 03:08:42.489]  Pacifism.
[03:08:43.309 --> 03:08:43.790]  Pacifism.
[03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:50.946]   You don't hear pacifism talked about much, but pacifism is actually a socialist technique Of disarmament.
[03:08:51.666 --> 03:08:55.067]  Because remember, pacifism is not just about, oh, I'm anti-war.
[03:08:55.868 --> 03:09:00.789]  I mean, I'm typically anti-war because most of the wars are not fought for the reasons that we're told.
[03:09:01.209 --> 03:09:05.550]  They're fought for very powerful, wealthy people, corporate interests, and so forth.
[03:09:05.891 --> 03:09:07.891]  So that's why I don't support it.
[03:09:07.951 --> 03:09:14.833]  I'm not dying for Coke and Pepsi in another country so that Iraq and Ukraine can have Subway and abortions.
[03:09:15.193 --> 03:09:16.374]  Why would I want to die for that?
[03:09:18.539 --> 03:09:28.188]  But patriotism has to go away, because patriotism stands in the way of you being obeisant to the international order.
[03:09:29.069 --> 03:09:33.633]  And a lot of what you see here is actually outlined in Brave New World, remember?
[03:09:33.713 --> 03:09:35.755]  We just covered Brave New World again recently.
[03:09:36.736 --> 03:09:41.841]  And so this one world socialist dictatorship, not Marxist, but socialist, there is a difference.
[03:09:42.421 --> 03:09:46.972]   The difference being Reorganized Reform Marxism is Fabian Socialism.
[03:09:47.352 --> 03:09:48.893]  And that's the effective model.
[03:09:49.353 --> 03:09:52.215]  That's the model that has turned the EU Socialist.
[03:09:52.895 --> 03:09:53.676]  They were all Fabians.
[03:09:55.297 --> 03:09:59.800]  All of these international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, they're all Fabian Socialist institutions.
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:01.241]  John Maynard Keynes, Fabian Socialist.
[03:10:02.701 --> 03:10:12.848]  The Eastern Seaboard Establishment Colleges, they're all peopled by and have been run for decades by people who adhere to Fabian Socialism or forms of Socialism.
[03:10:16.534 --> 03:10:22.097]  And there might be the occasional, you know, Ayn Randian type professor here or there, but that's a super minority.
[03:10:22.458 --> 03:10:31.503]  That's the majority of where people are going in the last 50, 60 years in their thought process is towards socialism.
[03:10:32.544 --> 03:10:37.827]  All of the Millennials and Zoomers that think they're going to get a UBI and think they're going to get there, all that socialism is nonsense.
[03:10:38.627 --> 03:10:39.388]  It's a trap.
[03:10:40.228 --> 03:10:49.494]  It's a tool to get you into this slave system, and Dr. John Coleman is 100% correct, that all of these socialist countries become slave states.
[03:10:50.655 --> 03:11:01.061]  It doesn't deliver the promises, and it doesn't matter how many times it fails, people still believe in it, because they just say, well, socialism does work, but the capitalists sabotaged it.
[03:11:01.542 --> 03:11:03.523]  We're always sabotaged by the evil capitalists.
[03:11:04.143 --> 03:11:08.526]  And it's like, how could you be sabotaged by the people that are funding and helping you come to power?
[03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:15.012]  Monopoly capitalism is what allows socialism to even occur.
[03:11:15.472 --> 03:11:16.052]  It funds it.
[03:11:16.072 --> 03:11:16.472]  It aids it.
[03:11:16.592 --> 03:11:18.774]  And the deeper inner party elite know this.
[03:11:18.894 --> 03:11:20.134]  They even say that in their books.
[03:11:21.215 --> 03:11:21.415]  H.G.
[03:11:21.435 --> 03:11:26.297]  Wells says to the Marxists, stop being dumb Marxists thinking that the capitalists are your enemy.
[03:11:27.278 --> 03:11:27.758]  He says this.
[03:11:27.798 --> 03:11:31.920]  He says, who do you think will build the international structure that we will take over?
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:32.620]  The capitalists.
[03:11:36.322 --> 03:11:48.390]   Number four plank of the reorganized Fabian strategy is, we must get rid of or change the notion of the United States Constitution and its rule by law.
[03:11:49.350 --> 03:11:59.233]  So, even though not everything in the Constitution is necessarily ideal, from my vantage point, it could be a lot more explicit in some of its values and so forth.
[03:11:59.253 --> 03:12:03.594]  It's kind of an Enlightenment, Deist-ish, John Locke type thing.
[03:12:04.344 --> 03:12:07.006]  So, but it also has a lot of good points in it as well.
[03:12:07.707 --> 03:12:17.154]  And one of those things, though, the good points is that there's limitations to power and limitations to centralization that's baked into the Constitution and our form of government, right?
[03:12:17.655 --> 03:12:21.778]  So everybody has these rights, but that's all being eroded by design.
[03:12:22.719 --> 03:12:24.320]  Eroded by design a long time ago.
[03:12:24.340 --> 03:12:38.929]   Again, this is the 1910s, I think, when the Fabians drew up this, their plan, their seven-plan 1910s, 20s, to completely change the landscape of America.
[03:12:38.989 --> 03:12:45.635]  And here we are 100 years later after this plan was drawn up and most of this seven-point plank they've gotten in.
[03:12:48.457 --> 03:12:55.363]  So the Constitution has to change because the Constitution limits the power of the centralization model that these people all want.
[03:12:56.371 --> 03:13:09.518]  And so again, AOC, she doesn't know anything about this stuff, but she's default a socialist of this order, precisely because she's a perfect product of this brainwashing and corporate control that created her, you see.
[03:13:10.239 --> 03:13:22.566]  So the corporate socialism I'm talking about churns out the AOCs as an example, who are turning our country into the very thing that the Fabians said they wanted 100 years ago.
[03:13:24.387 --> 03:13:25.067]  Number five.
[03:13:26.474 --> 03:13:33.518]  Get rid of the, or excuse me, implement the graduated income tax, the IRS system.
[03:13:33.898 --> 03:13:34.818]  And of course that occurred.
[03:13:35.639 --> 03:13:42.282]  Number six, or excuse me, number seven, the final plank, or excuse me, I guess he's got this misnumbered, so it's six planks.
[03:13:42.722 --> 03:13:45.143]  The sixth plank is free trade.
[03:13:46.444 --> 03:14:01.285]   And this is relevant because when Dr. Coleman was writing this book, was back at the time when Ross Perot was talking about NAFTA and free trade and GATT and all that, and that it would be a giant sucking sound destroying the industry in the country.
[03:14:01.305 --> 03:14:02.085]  Of course, that's true.
[03:14:02.125 --> 03:14:05.686]  Free trade is a Fabian socialist plan.
[03:14:06.206 --> 03:14:11.247]  Now people blow their heads explode when you say this because they go, wait a minute, that's a free, that's a free market.
[03:14:11.267 --> 03:14:11.707]  What do you mean?
[03:14:12.027 --> 03:14:12.887]  Free trade.
[03:14:14.187 --> 03:14:22.640]   No, did you know that if you go to Marxist.org, You can find the articles where Marx and Engels themselves argued for free trade.
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:23.921]  Why would they argue for free trade?
[03:14:24.221 --> 03:14:25.801]  That's a capitalist idea.
[03:14:26.902 --> 03:14:39.927]  Because free trade allows for the devaluation of the existing population's labor and their quality of goods because it allows for the prices to collapse.
[03:14:41.088 --> 03:14:49.306]   And Marx knew this and he actually says in one of his talks that Hopefully this would cause the proletariat to get enraged and overthrow the country.
[03:14:50.527 --> 03:15:04.839]  So again, that's one example of Marx and Engels saying that let's institute a horrible policy that is damaging to the American worker or the worker of the nation state to enrage them to try to cause a revolution.
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:10.204]  So it's economic warfare and chaos to try to destroy the country to bring it down.
[03:15:11.019 --> 03:15:19.848]  And Beatrice and Sidney Webb, the famous socialists, actually know that they actually said these policies don't actually work to help the economy.
[03:15:20.729 --> 03:15:36.986]   They knew that it damages the middle class, it helps the 0.01%, but in destroying the economy, they actually believed, gradually bringing it down, destroying it over time, Sapping it, the dollar of its purchasing power, all of that.
[03:15:37.366 --> 03:15:44.570]  They actually believe that this would lead to everyone crying out for an international order.
[03:15:44.850 --> 03:15:45.350]  Save us!
[03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:45.990]  Save us!
[03:15:46.751 --> 03:15:48.192]  The very thing Klaus talks about.
[03:15:52.173 --> 03:15:59.297]  The collapses, the wars, all of this, and I think that this could tie it into the potentiality of World War III that we may be going into.
[03:15:59.317 --> 03:16:02.218]  I mean, war is the health of the state.
[03:16:02.798 --> 03:16:07.798]  War allows regions to be rebuilt, all of this.
[03:16:07.798 --> 03:16:10.717]   A lot of the military industrial complex, of course, makes a bunch of money off of that.
[03:16:10.717 --> 03:16:19.197]   But it's also a way to say all this conflict resulted from religion and from nation states and the Bible.
[03:16:19.197 --> 03:16:23.958]   And it's time to throw all that away and enter into the pure Luciferian order
[03:16:23.958 --> 03:16:27.718]   of a one world socialist dictatorship where there's no religions,
[03:16:27.718 --> 03:16:29.516]  except the pure worship of Lucifer.
[03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:30.771]  There's no nation states.
[03:16:31.151 --> 03:16:32.552]  There's just the technocracy.
[03:16:32.812 --> 03:16:40.659]  There's just the computers and the centralized grid giving you your nutrients and your coon pot and then we get rid of you because you don't need to exist.
[03:16:40.679 --> 03:16:41.459]  This is Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:41.479 --> 03:16:41.900]  I'm Jay Dockery.
[03:16:42.980 --> 03:16:47.584]  Now about to talk about something really historic and very very exciting.
[03:16:47.985 --> 03:16:50.467]  There's a lot of angles to this in the limited time we have.
[03:16:51.297 --> 03:16:58.861]  But America has been a special place because we aspired to liberty and freedom when nobody else was aspiring to it.
[03:16:59.261 --> 03:17:14.809]  We weren't perfect, we were far from it, but it was a place where experiments were allowed and where people could really try to prove themselves, not because of what family they came from or because they were from royalty, but a meritocracy based on what they could produce, what they could do.
[03:17:15.569 --> 03:17:25.173]  There were two things that really fueled and funded the colonies and the launch of America in 1776, and both of them are interesting.
[03:17:25.453 --> 03:17:30.235]  Both of them have dark histories, but both of them are something that you can enjoy responsibly.
[03:17:31.095 --> 03:17:37.358]  That's, of course, tobacco and the Virginia colony, and that's, of course, whiskey.
[03:17:38.402 --> 03:17:42.489]  And Sam Adams with whiskey and beer was one of the main boosters and funders.
[03:17:42.509 --> 03:17:46.615]  In fact, probably the biggest funder of George Washington and our troops.
[03:17:47.136 --> 03:17:48.157]  So it was whiskey and beer.
[03:17:50.472 --> 03:17:52.412]  Not wine, the liberals love to drink.
[03:17:52.452 --> 03:17:53.633]  I'm not against wine, it's just a fact.
[03:17:54.053 --> 03:17:57.313]  That literally fuel the start of our country, along with this, tobacco.
[03:17:57.874 --> 03:18:01.494]  And I enjoy both, but I've really gotten good over the years at being responsible.
[03:18:01.854 --> 03:18:07.836]  Sometimes I might go four months, that's the longest I've gone the last few years, with no tobacco or no alcohol.
[03:18:08.196 --> 03:18:16.218]  But when I'm with friends, when I'm with family, when I'm with patriots, I enjoy both of them, and they go together like a horse and carriage.
[03:18:16.938 --> 03:18:17.118]  Show!
[03:18:18.158 --> 03:18:27.121]  Two years ago, I got approached by great patriots from some of my connections who are major craft whiskey producers in Kentucky.
[03:18:27.641 --> 03:18:34.163]  So they brought me dozens of these amazing whiskeys that they had developed and also procured.
[03:18:34.743 --> 03:18:38.044]  And out of all of them, I like this Kentucky Straight Bourbon.
[03:18:38.704 --> 03:18:40.765]  Again, I'm no whiskey connoisseur.
[03:18:40.805 --> 03:18:47.805]   know what tastes good, what I like, what feels good, which doesn't give you that big hangover
[03:18:47.805 --> 03:18:54.164]   after. I liked out of dozens, over a dozen I tried, this whiskey. Now, the bad news is
[03:18:54.164 --> 03:19:00.245]   they only had so many barrels of it, and so it's a limited supply. There's 10,000 bottles
[03:19:00.245 --> 03:19:05.604]  of this as of the time I'm cutting this, and it is amazing.
[03:19:05.744 --> 03:19:14.546]  And it's been ready for a year because of leftists trying to block it being in stores and behind-the-scenes harassment and debanking and stuff of this major whiskey company.
[03:19:15.206 --> 03:19:16.907]  This has been in the warehouse for a year.
[03:19:17.447 --> 03:19:24.268]  So it wasn't just aged for the years it was in the barrels, it's been aged by their censorship and went from amazing to incredible.
[03:19:24.728 --> 03:19:26.949]  So it's a very special bottle too.
[03:19:28.012 --> 03:19:31.753]  That's why we have all these government documents here in front of me right here.
[03:19:32.173 --> 03:19:38.694]  Because if you aim a blacklight at Conspiracy Bourbon, ConspiracyBourbon.com is the only place to get it.
[03:19:39.134 --> 03:19:46.256]  It's got all of these hidden messages on it, on the front and on the back.
[03:19:46.276 --> 03:19:49.937]  So like I said, this is really, really special, limited run, only place to get it.
[03:19:50.457 --> 03:19:54.538]  We have the conspiracy imperatives, 10 of them, kind of the 10 commandments.

[03:20:00.420 --> 03:20:03.660]  Destroy the tyrants.
[03:20:03.660 --> 03:20:05.020]  It just goes on and on.
[03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:07.240]  This is very, very special.
[03:20:07.240 --> 03:20:10.920]   I would imagine that most people that get this are never gonna open it.
[03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:14.679]   Gut level, I think this is gonna be a major collector's item.
[03:20:14.679 --> 03:20:16.720]  We could have sold it for $200 in the market.
[03:20:16.720 --> 03:20:18.560]  It's 60-something bucks instead.
[03:20:18.560 --> 03:20:20.680]  It's a fundraiser for the operation.
[03:20:20.680 --> 03:20:22.319]  We're really, really, really, really proud of it.
[03:20:22.319 --> 03:20:26.680]   So while you're hanging out with your friends, your family, your coworkers, you name it,
[03:20:26.680 --> 03:20:30.120]   it's really important to remember what Americana's all about.
[03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:34.600]   And if you are somebody that likes a fine whiskey, well, this is it, and it funds the InfoWar.
[03:20:35.073 --> 03:20:36.975]  A true 360 win.
[03:20:37.555 --> 03:20:42.178]  For myself, the entire InfoWars crew, here's to you, and here's to America.
[03:20:42.579 --> 03:20:50.284]  This isn't some Dylan Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch, transgenderism, you know, Creepazoid targeting our children.
[03:20:50.804 --> 03:21:01.181]   This is high-quality American Kentucky, Whiskey, Kentucky bourbon, funding the second American revolution against tyrants.
[03:21:01.661 --> 03:21:05.765]  So here's all the past patriots, the current patriots, and future patriots.
