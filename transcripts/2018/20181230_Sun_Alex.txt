[00:00:03.243 --> 00:00:05.864]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:12.666]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:21.508]  Well, here we are.
[00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:27.570]  It's the last live Sunday broadcast of 2018.
[00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.070]  December.
[00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:32.274]  30th, 2018.
[00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:43.983]  This incredible year is about to give up the ghost and plunge into history.
[00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:47.246]  And then, 2019 looms.
[00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:54.271]  Not on the horizon, but one inch from our face.
[00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.332]  What does it hold?
[00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:56.513]  What were the biggest stories?
[00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:57.434]  What was most important?
[00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:03.891]  In this year, and what is coming in the next year.
[00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:13.655]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, hated by the vampire establishment for one reason.
[00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:20.498]  I love life, and I love competition, and I aim to stop them with your help.
[00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:24.207]  And I'm not afraid of him.
[00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:32.609]  I've already calculated every possible permutation of persecution and already accepted it.
[00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:40.491]  Though I do feel guilty for doing even that.
[00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:41.071]  David Knight.
[00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:52.618]  Who is such a hard-working, smart, informed jewel of a person, had a pretty serious heart attack last night.
[00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:59.944]  And it's rough going in the hospital right now here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:07.269]  I met with him on Thursday and he was really concerned about the country and really took all of it on.
[00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:13.083]  I told him, I said, you need to take some time off, buddy.
[00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:17.985]  You know, his skin was ash white.
[00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:20.486]  He's lost a lot of weight.
[00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:25.127]  He gets ready for four or five hours every day before a show and studies for three or four hours after that.
[00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:28.829]  There's nothing I've researched he doesn't already know about.
[00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.630]  I mean, let me tell you, this guy's like a monk.
[00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.612]  And I said, you need to take off.
[00:02:36.612 --> 00:02:38.492]  You got too close to this.
[00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.793]  You stared in the abyss too long.
[00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:47.278]  Well, basically, without getting too many details, turns out he's had heart blocks for a while, probably had a heart attack before, didn't even know about it.
[00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:51.681]  And he's got some big, serious procedures tomorrow morning to go under.
[00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.364]  And he definitely needs your prayers.
[00:02:55.364 --> 00:03:02.368]  And all the attacks we go through, the fake lawsuits, the boycotts, the lies, that's from the globalists.
[00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:03.129]  I can deal with that.
[00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.133]  But, you know, having somebody like David, who does such a great job and reaches millions of people a week,
[00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:12.176]  Fighting for his life.
[00:03:12.176 --> 00:03:13.357]  That's what he's doing right now.
[00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:14.818]  He's fighting for his life.
[00:03:14.818 --> 00:03:16.519]  Just a few miles from where I sit.
[00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.282]  It gets to me.
[00:03:21.282 --> 00:03:25.185]  It's a shadow of a portent for what comes for everybody.
[00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:32.831]  It's that feeling where you're not afraid of death anymore, but you're afraid of your body giving out, so you're not there for my children.
[00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:34.993]  So I tell you, when I look at my son and my three daughters,
[00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:38.900]  I just think about how can I be better?
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.145]  How can I exercise more?
[00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:49.668]  a better steward of my health, because you just want to live longer for them, not for yourself.
[00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:51.549]  And David's got a big family he takes care of.
[00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.330]  He's a great guy.
[00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.654]  And again, I asked the family, I said, you want me to talk about this?
[00:03:58.654 --> 00:04:00.555]  They said, yeah, do whatever you think you need.
[00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:01.816]  Just please ask for prayers.
[00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:05.578]  But I know the specifics of the prognosis.
[00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.620]  And I called a heart surgeon I know.
[00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:19.623]  To get what the particular surgeries mean and it's not, no heart attack is not serious, but David definitely needs your prayers.
[00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:24.326]  He definitely needs your prayers because they're going to cauterize his heart tomorrow morning.
[00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:26.848]  Means burn.
[00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:28.149]  And they're going to do some other things to it.
[00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:29.651]  I'm not going to get into the whole deal.
[00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:34.774]  The family's watching and listening, but David's a tough guy.
[00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.977]  He's, it looks like he's been up here working for years with his
[00:04:40.353 --> 00:04:43.396]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:06.036]  This life is a test.
[00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:18.264]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing as being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[00:05:18.264 --> 00:05:28.251]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:32.414]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:37.004]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and you tend to see it.
[00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.665]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:43.487]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[00:05:43.487 --> 00:05:44.328]  2018 has been insane.
[00:05:44.328 --> 00:05:51.672]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:55.354]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:59.436]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:17.749]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:23.656]  Well, there's only about a day and a half left in the epic, and I mean epic year, of 2018.
[00:06:26.258 --> 00:06:30.121]  A lot of folks used to overuse the term epic, but we're living in epic times.
[00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:31.843]  Interesting times.
[00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:43.893]  My good buddy, one of the smartest people I know, when it comes to giant breadth of knowledge, an engineer, a patriot, David Knight is having a rough time in the hospital.
[00:06:43.893 --> 00:06:45.914]  Had a big heart attack last night.
[00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:50.178]  He's going to have some big heart surgeries tomorrow, multiple procedures.
[00:06:50.178 --> 00:06:51.879]  And so he needs your prayers.
[00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.842]  And here's one of the most powerful intros he ever put together.
[00:06:56.343 --> 00:07:03.627]  Dealing with eugenics, dealing with dehumanization, dealing with the devaluation of life, something he has fought so hard against.
[00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:14.494]  So, on this Sunday night, the 30th day of December 2018, while David Knight's fighting for his life, our great host of the David Knight Show, Weekday Mornings, I thought I'd go ahead and play this piece.
[00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:14.834]  Here it is.
[00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:27.330]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.511]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:37.773]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:43.094]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:07:43.094 --> 00:07:47.055]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:50.279]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.922]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:57.768]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.751]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:04.356]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:08:04.356 --> 00:08:05.978]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:21.132]  ...rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:08:21.132 --> 00:08:23.133]  So, enjoy the flavor!
[00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:27.776]  We're gonna get the real solution, which is gonna be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:08:27.776 --> 00:08:29.737]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:08:29.737 --> 00:08:31.597]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:32.918]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:08:32.918 --> 00:08:34.399]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:46.142]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:50.523]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:56.805]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:07.645]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:12.549]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:15.051]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:24.418]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.621]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:29.763]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:31.144]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:34.805]  I repeat, the spooks are on their way.
[00:09:34.805 --> 00:09:38.746]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:41.887]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:09:41.887 --> 00:09:43.907]  We've got to stop them!
[00:09:43.907 --> 00:09:44.467]  Come on!
[00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:48.948]  That is our secret name, Soylent Green.
[00:09:48.948 --> 00:09:51.329]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:57.410]  They keep saying they'll be breeding us like cattle, for food.
[00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.391]  We've got to tell them.
[00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:05.896]  So there's an important piece with David Knight featured in it.
[00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:08.537]  Again, David, it's a great part of the InfoWars operation.
[00:10:08.537 --> 00:10:11.558]  I've been planning to push to go live at least 20 hours a day here.
[00:10:11.558 --> 00:10:15.820]  We've got David Knight, we've got Owen Schroer, we've got Roger Stone and others.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.461]  And we obviously want David to pull through.
[00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.544]  All of this and serious heart surgery he's got to have tomorrow.
[00:10:23.544 --> 00:10:25.326]  So please, please pray for him.
[00:10:25.326 --> 00:10:35.193]  You know, they took down his InfoWars Twitter accounts and they banned him on Google and Facebook and he had over 9 million subscribers to his radio and TV show on iTunes.
[00:10:35.193 --> 00:10:42.618]  And just because he was affiliated with me, the devil, they deleted all those as well because he's effective and he tells the truth.
[00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:45.665]  And that's all part of this amazing censorship.
[00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:55.710]  He still has his personal account, at Libertarian, where you can follow him at Twitter and hopefully support the family.
[00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.592]  Okay, let me tell you what's coming up here.
[00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:02.113]  Some of this I covered on Friday, but I want to recap.
[00:11:02.113 --> 00:11:10.337]  A lot of this is new, but it's just illustrative of the Trump derangement syndrome that is taking place.
[00:11:12.363 --> 00:11:31.010]  There was a big video that we posted on Saturday, DrudgeReport.com had it as its top story, still up there, of a man going into a vape shop, which isn't perfect for your health, but a lot of studies better for you than, you know, combustion with cigarettes.
[00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.952]  He's trying to get his wife some strawberry-flavored nicotine.
[00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:35.892]  And he's wearing a Trump hat.
[00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:37.856]  Watch!
[00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:42.323]  Unhinged leftist has mental breakdown, refuses service to Trump supporter in vape shop.
[00:11:46.485 --> 00:11:57.973]  And so he starts videotaping the guy calling him the N-word, hitting him, attacking him, because the white guy is virtue saving some black guy who's in there trying to buy.
[00:11:57.973 --> 00:12:01.035]  And the black guy's like, hey dude, I get it, you've done nothing wrong, we're gonna Trump out.
[00:12:01.035 --> 00:12:07.099]  But the leftist white person wants to act like this knight in shining armor, this savior.
[00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:12.463]  That's coming up next segment and next segment, another video of like a 6-3
[00:12:14.304 --> 00:12:17.486]  Transgendered man, bigger shoulders than I've got.
[00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:20.989]  I'm a pretty big guy.
[00:12:20.989 --> 00:12:24.772]  This guy's built like a you-know-what brick house.
[00:12:24.772 --> 00:12:25.372]  An S.H.
[00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:27.314]  you-know-what house.
[00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:30.756]  And he walks in there with a bunch of liberal trendies at a game stop.
[00:12:30.756 --> 00:12:33.678]  And the dude's wearing, you know, a pink shirt or whatever.
[00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:36.060]  Okay, but you look like an NFL linebacker.
[00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:40.516]  They're like, hey dude, sure, what do you want?
[00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:40.676]  Whoa!
[00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:41.736]  I'm a woman!
[00:12:41.736 --> 00:12:45.678]  I'm a... Video transgender goes nuts in a storm for being misgendered.
[00:12:45.678 --> 00:12:50.739]  This is the religion of oppression.
[00:12:50.739 --> 00:12:53.940]  And the left oppresses the left the most.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.142]  Because it's all about just bullying people.
[00:12:58.142 --> 00:13:00.783]  So that's coming up.
[00:13:00.783 --> 00:13:00.983]  Then...
[00:13:03.522 --> 00:13:08.363]  Roger Stone is going to be popping in to respond to the latest Mueller garbage.
[00:13:08.363 --> 00:13:10.744]  We've got Rudolph Giuliani saying, put up or shut up.
[00:13:10.744 --> 00:13:15.546]  You know, you've got Michael Moore in the clips coming up saying, I can't wait to see the Trump family in orange jumpsuits.
[00:13:15.546 --> 00:13:18.166]  And what's it for?
[00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:20.527]  Nothing to do with Russia.
[00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:24.348]  Michael Cohen, one of Trump's lawyers, had some corrupt dealings.
[00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:29.990]  He's pled guilty to with a taxi company that Trump has zero, nada, zip to do it.
[00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:39.723]  That's coming up.
[00:13:39.723 --> 00:13:49.134]  We're going to look at every angle of this, but I also want to tell you about Kevin Spacey.
[00:13:49.134 --> 00:13:55.042]  Now, a lot of people have said, Alex, it's been almost a week since disgraced top Hollywood actor
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.401]  I'm not gonna lie to you, I think he's a good actor.
[00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:01.282]  A great actor.
[00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:04.883]  Who I do not endorse politically, who I've exposed, who I don't like.
[00:14:04.883 --> 00:14:06.584]  I'm just saying he's a good actor.
[00:14:06.584 --> 00:14:09.065]  He's playing himself, a psychotic.
[00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:16.028]  He put out this video almost a week ago and people wanted me to comment, but I don't just comment.
[00:14:16.028 --> 00:14:19.829]  I watched it.
[00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:21.630]  Like what, last weekend or whatever when it came out.
[00:14:22.608 --> 00:14:30.473]  And then I watched the internet speculate, but then I began to connect the dots and the research started done, and there's no doubt.
[00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:35.155]  The internet is right.
[00:14:35.155 --> 00:14:37.197]  The knowledge of the internet is right.
[00:14:37.197 --> 00:14:46.222]  He definitely is threatening the pedophile establishment, the Clintons, and the British aristocracy that's heavily involved in pedophilia, and he signaled it all in the video.
[00:14:48.663 --> 00:14:51.784]  I mean, I already know Kevin Spacey's connected to known pedophiles.
[00:14:51.784 --> 00:14:53.725]  I already know he flies around on Jeffrey Epstein's planes.
[00:14:53.725 --> 00:15:03.129]  I already know that there's hundreds of reports of him groping people down to age 15, which is terrible.
[00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:07.291]  It's not as bad as raping little kids or murdering them, but, you know, he's a bad dude.
[00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:22.800]  But now that this Nantucket thing's coming out, where he's, when some guy says he's 23, and he's buying the guy drinks, and then he lets Spacey grab his crotch, and then never says no, and that's the big case?
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.361]  That doesn't sound like rape to me.
[00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:26.322]  And I'm not defending Kevin Spacey.
[00:15:26.322 --> 00:15:31.386]  I think the guy's a pervert, a pedophile, the evidence points towards it.
[00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:32.907]  On Jeffrey Epstein's plane.
[00:15:32.907 --> 00:15:33.488]  With the Clintons.
[00:15:34.853 --> 00:15:47.482]  But the point is, he is now openly threatening, there's no doubt in this video, that he is saying, I'm about to turn state's evidence if you don't drop these charges against me.
[00:15:47.482 --> 00:15:55.747]  So this is a big problem for Jeffrey Epstein, a big problem for Steve Bannon that works with Epstein, and a big problem with the Clintons.
[00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:59.510]  So stay with us, that's all coming up too, tonight.
[00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.572]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:16:02.572 --> 00:16:04.133]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:16:05.513 --> 00:16:08.434]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:12.494]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.

[00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:23.196]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:16:23.196 --> 00:16:28.557]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:45.565]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:48.086]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:16:48.086 --> 00:16:53.109]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.

[00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:04.222]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:06.163]  That's the globalist only hope.
[00:17:06.163 --> 00:17:25.375]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[00:17:25.635 --> 00:17:31.881]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[00:17:31.881 --> 00:17:37.547]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.

[00:17:45.555 --> 00:17:51.386]  Allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year.
[00:17:51.386 --> 00:17:53.269]  To not just fight, but to expand.
[00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:55.252]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:17:55.252 --> 00:17:56.214]  I salute you all.
[00:17:56.214 --> 00:17:57.717]  Now please take action at m4store.com.
[00:18:02.795 --> 00:18:12.217]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:23.639]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:18:23.639 --> 00:18:28.040]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.042]  It's time to take care of your morning routine.
[00:19:00.441 --> 00:19:05.983]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:19:05.983 --> 00:19:15.746]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:23.829]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:19:24.824 --> 00:19:32.750]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.853]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:19:35.853 --> 00:19:37.354]  It really is amazing.
[00:19:37.354 --> 00:19:44.060]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.742]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:19:48.027 --> 00:19:49.568]  Of Infowars.
[00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:50.869]  So please spread the links.
[00:19:50.869 --> 00:19:54.210]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.532]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:19:57.532 --> 00:19:58.853]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:19:58.853 --> 00:20:03.295]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:05.897]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:26.426]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:28.467]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.467 --> 00:20:33.411]  So on this December 30th, 2018 Sunday transmission, I'm going to say something extremely profound.
[00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:46.604]  And again, I'm not saying that to sound powerful.
[00:20:46.604 --> 00:20:51.767]  I'm saying that to get your attention, because I respect you and I need your help.
[00:20:51.767 --> 00:21:02.675]  No matter what color you are, where you came from, or in what gods you worship, they want us shut down because we've got their number.
[00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:09.720]  And I'm about to cover some issues and some reports
[00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:19.994]  That illustrate everything as a society, everything as a culture we're facing.
[00:21:19.994 --> 00:21:23.478]  Now, sometimes we see stories that illustrate everything we're dealing with.
[00:21:23.478 --> 00:21:30.926]  And that really show us what we're up against.
[00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:43.042]  And then it's crazy to see how the news and the culture takes each new story as if it's its own little thing disconnected from everything else.
[00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:51.965]  If you're police officers, say in Austin, Texas, we've had an epidemic of deaths from heroin the last few years.
[00:21:51.965 --> 00:21:53.706]  It's flooding the whole U.S.
[00:21:53.706 --> 00:21:55.867]  And you start seeing a bunch of deaths from heroin
[00:21:56.972 --> 00:22:12.983]  You know somebody's bringing in a bunch of heroin and that it's very very strong and that they're so criminal they're not even telling people how strong it is and to watch out.
[00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:16.345]  Just like the drug companies put out the very same stuff but it's synthetic.
[00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:20.688]  The FDA last week approved a drug 100 times stronger than heroin.
[00:22:23.749 --> 00:22:25.430]  This is madness.
[00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.471]  People say, well what are you getting at?
[00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:33.055]  I'm getting at more and more people in corporate America or in governments, period, just don't care.
[00:22:33.055 --> 00:22:40.339]  There's a mass craziness going on.
[00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:43.681]  And then those of us that complain, we're the bad guys.
[00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:50.446]  No, I believe in warning people.
[00:22:50.446 --> 00:22:52.167]  I believe caring about people builds a better
[00:22:53.058 --> 00:22:53.718]  Civilization.
[00:22:53.718 --> 00:23:05.182]  So, I want to get into transgender woman threatens to take it outside when GameStop employee uses the word, sir, because it's a big old guy.
[00:23:05.182 --> 00:23:06.843]  And a lot of guys wear pink shirts.
[00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:12.124]  You're looking at a guy with huge shoulders, bigger than mine, six foot three, six foot four.
[00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:14.305]  Looks like a dude to me.
[00:23:14.305 --> 00:23:16.646]  Walks like a lady though.
[00:23:16.646 --> 00:23:18.146]  Dude don't look like a lady.
[00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:19.407]  Dude looks like a fruitcake.
[00:23:21.118 --> 00:23:24.641]  And then how does that tie together with Kevin Spacey?
[00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.962]  How's that tie together with Lolita Express?
[00:23:26.962 --> 00:23:32.186]  How's that tie together with Franklin Graham Facebook ban was personal attack towards me?
[00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:44.755]  So we're gonna be looking at all of that coming up here.
[00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:51.862]  But the first thing I want to get to is heavily beat for TV and radio listeners.
[00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:58.007]  The raw videos on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, the most censored sites on the planet.
[00:23:58.007 --> 00:23:58.807]  It's easy to find.
[00:23:58.807 --> 00:24:04.471]  It's right dead smack middle of DrugsReport.com, the largest site on the planet.
[00:24:04.471 --> 00:24:06.513]  The largest site on the planet, the most censored site on the planet.
[00:24:09.386 --> 00:24:12.347]  And this gentleman walks in.
[00:24:12.347 --> 00:24:15.528]  Turns out he's a cell phone repair tower engineer.
[00:24:15.528 --> 00:24:17.409]  He's wearing his Trump hat, Trump shirt.
[00:24:17.409 --> 00:24:18.249]  He's very polite.
[00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:21.870]  The guy's blowing up at him, hitting him, slapping him, saying, get out.
[00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:31.533]  Virtue signaling.
[00:24:31.533 --> 00:24:34.434]  Doing all of this.
[00:24:34.434 --> 00:24:35.635]  And it just shows
[00:24:37.133 --> 00:24:49.383]  The insane craziness of the culture where the controlled corporate left thinks they can do anything or say anything they want to do and that it's okay because you're a Trump supporter.
[00:24:49.383 --> 00:24:54.668]  And they're trying to intimidate that speech.
[00:24:54.668 --> 00:24:58.731]  So let's go ahead and go to this video, this audio.
[00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:01.053]  This happened in Atlanta two days ago.
[00:25:01.053 --> 00:25:01.794]  Here it is.
[00:25:06.468 --> 00:25:12.814]  Here we are at Exhale Vapor City in Tucker, Georgia, and I have just been asked to leave the store.
[00:25:12.814 --> 00:25:13.475]  He greeted me.
[00:25:13.475 --> 00:25:14.416]  That was nice.
[00:25:14.416 --> 00:25:19.021]  I did find the item that I wanted, and the next thing he said was that he'd like me to leave.
[00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:23.025]  If you do not stop recording in my store, I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave now.
[00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:23.565]  Please call the police.
[00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:25.187]  That would be awesome.
[00:25:25.187 --> 00:25:26.288]  That'd be awesome.
[00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:28.150]  We can call Fox 5 and all sorts of stuff.
[00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:28.550]  I'd like to
[00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:31.873]  I would like to purchase something here.
[00:25:31.873 --> 00:25:35.255]  Please do call your boss, because I will be calling corporate.
[00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:35.855]  Go for it.
[00:25:35.855 --> 00:25:41.479]  I am looking forward to releasing this video, because I just want to purchase something- Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:42.180]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.101]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:43.761]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:44.582]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:44.582 --> 00:25:46.183]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:46.183 --> 00:25:46.763]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:46.763 --> 00:25:47.303]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:47.303 --> 00:25:48.764]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:48.764 --> 00:25:50.205]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:50.205 --> 00:25:51.346]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:51.346 --> 00:25:51.987]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:51.987 --> 00:25:52.567]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:53.428]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:54.108]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:54.108 --> 00:25:55.109]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:55.109 --> 00:25:55.729]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:55.729 --> 00:25:56.390]  Get the f*** off me here, man!
[00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.590]  Get the
[00:25:59.013 --> 00:26:07.163]  If you're a radio listener, you're hearing that, or two of you are, you see that there's a black guy standing there waving his arms and one like, what?
[00:26:07.163 --> 00:26:08.565]  A Trump supporter isn't racist.
[00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:29.420]  But the white clerk is so triggered that he can show off to a black guy that he's gonna hop around like he's a hip-hop artist and do weird cultural appropriation as if black people all act like a hip-hop artist jumping around on stage and go, man, screw you, bitch, you're a racist, blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.962]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[00:26:32.962 --> 00:26:35.183]  But that's who these people are.
[00:26:36.724 --> 00:26:40.707]  I haven't been in a Whole Foods in months since I protested Jeff Bezos taking it over.
[00:26:40.707 --> 00:26:46.031]  But my wife wanted to pick up something particular at Whole Foods, so I went with her yesterday.
[00:26:46.031 --> 00:26:53.257]  And I had multiple people come up to me and shake my hand, but I had a couple of them come up and make bizarre statements that didn't make sense.
[00:26:53.257 --> 00:26:54.618]  But anyways, I'm sorry.
[00:26:54.618 --> 00:26:56.960]  Let's go ahead and go back to the video.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.260]  Here it is.
[00:27:02.304 --> 00:27:05.865]  I'm not serving anyone that has to do with that.
[00:27:05.865 --> 00:27:07.325]  He's a treasonous asshole.
[00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:12.487]  I don't have a problem with you, sir, whatsoever.
[00:27:12.487 --> 00:27:13.987]  I just want good health care for my kids.
[00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:17.929]  I don't have a problem with the color of your skin or yours.
[00:27:17.929 --> 00:27:21.090]  I'd like to purchase some of this naked vape juice, though, if that would be all right.
[00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:25.063]  Alright, here's where we're at.
[00:27:25.063 --> 00:27:25.743]  Leave the store!
[00:27:25.743 --> 00:27:26.303]  LEAVE THE STORE!
[00:27:26.303 --> 00:27:27.084]  LEAVE THE STORE!
[00:27:27.084 --> 00:27:28.324]  LEAVE THE STORE!
[00:27:28.324 --> 00:27:31.366]  F**K OFF!
[00:27:31.366 --> 00:27:34.028]  I DON'T GIVE A F**K!
[00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:35.328]  GET OUT!
[00:27:35.328 --> 00:27:35.869]  Dude?
[00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:37.169]  Go ahead, take another swing at it.
[00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:39.030]  Make contact with me one more time.
[00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.111]  I'm gonna make a deal with you.
[00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:47.275]  I wanna purchase that vape juice.
[00:27:47.275 --> 00:27:49.797]  If you sell it to me, I won't call the police.
[00:27:49.797 --> 00:27:52.038]  This is unedited except for me pausing it.
[00:27:53.134 --> 00:27:59.380]  Just like when Trump won, people stood there at the inauguration and went, no!
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.624]  And we go to these events, it's like they're toddlers.
[00:28:02.624 --> 00:28:06.648]  And by the way, I'm not defending minorities, just a virtue signal.
[00:28:06.648 --> 00:28:12.414]  Most of the leadership of this weird mental illness are weird white kids of weird hippie parents.
[00:28:17.435 --> 00:28:25.204]  And they're just creating this totally race-based thing where they say you're this horrible thing, so they're gonna yell and scream at you.
[00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:25.805]  Let's continue.
[00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:27.647]  Let's finish the quote.
[00:28:27.647 --> 00:28:28.508]  That for my wife!
[00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:49.255]  I love once he does it back down to the cut, the cut backs down but then blows up again.
[00:28:49.255 --> 00:28:50.856]  Full videos on Infowars.com.
[00:28:50.856 --> 00:28:52.797]  It's one of the top videos on the internet right now.
[00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:53.998]  We come back though.
[00:28:53.998 --> 00:28:58.762]  Wait till a 6'3 man, looks like an NFL linebacker, blows up at you.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.723]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:30:00.097 --> 00:30:02.819]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:30:02.819 --> 00:30:09.144]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:30:09.144 --> 00:30:11.145]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:27.898]  With our powerhouse formula, Happies can be an important
[00:30:28.058 --> 00:30:28.398]  I think so.
[00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:05.521]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:31:05.521 --> 00:31:15.285]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:31:15.285 --> 00:31:23.328]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:32.307]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:35.410]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.912]  It really is amazing.
[00:31:36.912 --> 00:31:43.618]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:31:43.618 --> 00:31:46.301]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:31:47.586 --> 00:31:49.107]  Of InfoWars.
[00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:50.428]  So please spread the links.
[00:31:50.428 --> 00:31:53.770]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.092]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:31:57.092 --> 00:31:58.413]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:31:58.413 --> 00:31:59.874]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:31:59.874 --> 00:32:03.476]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:32:03.476 --> 00:32:04.697]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:32:05.237 --> 00:32:05.857]  We're good to go.
[00:32:22.762 --> 00:32:32.429]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:36.992]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:32:40.134 --> 00:32:41.855]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:32:41.855 --> 00:32:51.863]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:32:51.863 --> 00:32:54.505]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:32:54.505 --> 00:33:03.351]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:06.053]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.790]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.194]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:57.765 --> 00:34:00.247]  I apologize.
[00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:07.432]  We are a working live international news center here in Austin, Texas, called InfoWars, dreaded by the globalists.
[00:34:07.432 --> 00:34:10.634]  During the break, he called us back.
[00:34:10.634 --> 00:34:13.516]  That's right, he's coming up next segment or maybe at the start of the next hour.
[00:34:13.516 --> 00:34:14.477]  In the next 30 minutes.
[00:34:15.782 --> 00:34:20.484]  The clip you just heard us play earlier, that's one of the top stories in the United States.
[00:34:20.484 --> 00:34:22.365]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[00:34:22.365 --> 00:34:28.668]  The gentleman is going to be on the show with us, who was in Atlanta, Georgia, and went into the vape shop.
[00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:36.512]  Unhinged leftist has meltdown, mental meltdown, refuses service to Trump supporter, physically attacks him.
[00:34:36.512 --> 00:34:38.653]  That gentleman was fired.
[00:34:38.653 --> 00:34:46.195]  Well, it turns out, of course, our Trump supporter is busy on Sunday night working repairing shell towers.
[00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:48.136]  He's on top a shell tower right now.
[00:34:48.136 --> 00:34:50.377]  He already tweeted today and put on his Facebook.
[00:34:50.377 --> 00:34:51.037]  We'll show it later.
[00:34:52.157 --> 00:34:58.161]  Ian Ferguson, that he's up on a cell tower fixing it in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:34:58.161 --> 00:35:01.884]  So he's going to be joining us during his next break.
[00:35:01.884 --> 00:35:06.027]  He's got a 15 minute break and he'll be able to join us to just get into this.
[00:35:06.027 --> 00:35:09.569]  And listen, the left is crazy.
[00:35:09.569 --> 00:35:10.710]  I was at Whole Foods yesterday.
[00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:14.692]  My wife wanted me to go shopping with her.
[00:35:14.692 --> 00:35:15.792]  I don't tell her where to shop.
[00:35:15.792 --> 00:35:16.692]  She shops all over.
[00:35:16.692 --> 00:35:22.474]  She tries not to buy from Amazon or, you know, from other globalist groups that base those zones like Whole Foods.
[00:35:22.474 --> 00:35:25.255]  But she wanted some particular food there.
[00:35:25.255 --> 00:35:26.195]  And so we go there.
[00:35:26.195 --> 00:35:28.696]  It's right by our house too.
[00:35:28.696 --> 00:35:38.920]  And like twice, dudes would walk over while I'm pushing the cart and swing her face in like an inch and say like, you're a danger to America.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.600]  I'm going left.
[00:35:40.959 --> 00:35:46.983]  One guy said, you're a danger to America, I'm going left, and then stomped away with his wife, or his girlfriend.
[00:35:46.983 --> 00:35:50.946]  I'm like, okay, whatever that means.
[00:35:50.946 --> 00:36:03.695]  And then another guy, while I'm literally buying my daughter a stuffed animal, because up at the front they had some stuffed animals, he walks over and he goes, hope you're proud of what you've done.
[00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:05.497]  Hope you're proud.
[00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.618]  But we're ashamed of you.
[00:36:07.618 --> 00:36:09.840]  Like that, I'm like, okay, well you're a mental patient.
[00:36:10.945 --> 00:36:12.786]  But they didn't dump coffee on my head.
[00:36:12.786 --> 00:36:13.566]  They didn't scream at me.
[00:36:13.566 --> 00:36:15.527]  They were to take me outside and kick my butt.
[00:36:15.527 --> 00:36:16.987]  So it's like, okay, great.
[00:36:16.987 --> 00:36:17.548]  Didn't say a word.
[00:36:17.548 --> 00:36:20.669]  Like, okay, great.
[00:36:20.669 --> 00:36:24.370]  But I should know better to go into a Whole Foods.
[00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:29.712]  And by the way, once I got in the Whole Foods and the first guy confronted me, I'm like, I'm in a blue city, Austin.
[00:36:29.712 --> 00:36:30.533]  I'm in a Whole Foods.
[00:36:30.533 --> 00:36:31.173]  The blue is the blue.
[00:36:32.509 --> 00:36:33.530]  Don't I expect this?
[00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.951]  And I kind of do, but it's not like I'm feeling bad.
[00:36:35.951 --> 00:36:37.532]  Oh, these people are in my face.
[00:36:37.532 --> 00:36:51.261]  These are un-American authoritarian dirtbags who worship Jeff Bezos, who pays no taxes, totally ruthless, screws in his employees over, and lobbies for taxes to be raised in the middle class.
[00:36:51.261 --> 00:36:53.843]  I mean, these people are schmucks!
[00:36:53.843 --> 00:36:55.704]  They're chumps!
[00:36:55.704 --> 00:36:57.345]  I'm a classical liberal.
[00:36:57.345 --> 00:37:01.068]  I believe in lower taxes, more personal freedom, the right to defense,
[00:37:02.509 --> 00:37:07.131]  I was a libertarian 24 years ago when I got on air.
[00:37:07.131 --> 00:37:12.292]  I wasn't virtue signaling to gay people that I didn't hate them when I said I don't hate you.
[00:37:12.292 --> 00:37:17.954]  I wasn't virtue signaling, you know, when I said that people can live their own lives.
[00:37:17.954 --> 00:37:20.815]  But it's the left that won't let me live my life.
[00:37:20.815 --> 00:37:22.856]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:24.357]  I'm tired of it.
[00:37:24.357 --> 00:37:26.157]  And you know what?
[00:37:26.157 --> 00:37:28.278]  I've gone through the fire.
[00:37:28.278 --> 00:37:29.318]  I'm not worried anymore.
[00:37:32.392 --> 00:37:42.622]  I'm on a level of things, which I'm not bragging about by the way, it's actually sickening, where there's very few men that'll stand up for what's right.
[00:37:42.622 --> 00:37:46.185]  So if you do that, you're immediately elevated up to contending with the globalists.
[00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:58.192]  The average man just completely sells out of the system and they'll just do whatever.
[00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:02.213]  They'll just virtue signal to whatever the corporate America wants.
[00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:05.874]  Well, then corporate America is run by a bunch of extremists.
[00:38:05.874 --> 00:38:07.095]  They want submission.
[00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:15.337]  They're going to give you a request that you're not going to be able to submit to at a certain point.
[00:38:15.337 --> 00:38:16.217]  And that's what's frustrating.
[00:38:18.459 --> 00:38:20.560]  The globalists don't want to compromise with anybody.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.062]  They want total power.
[00:38:24.062 --> 00:38:40.993]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, General Electric, all the Fortune 100 pay almost zero taxes, write the laws to pay zero taxes, fund Black Lives Matter and cop-killer organizations and Metro La Raja as a virtue signal.
[00:38:40.993 --> 00:38:46.136]  While Americans all fight and kill each other, they're lobbying for higher taxes on the middle class.
[00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:55.995]  Which they extract in government contracts, laughing all the way to the bank on us.
[00:38:55.995 --> 00:39:00.237]  And then I've gotta routinely have some college-educated wimp, some beta male.
[00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:14.503]  You know, I told the story about him three weeks ago, and I wish I'd have controlled myself better, because I usually do, but I was coming up here to a Saturday show, I bought the crew breakfast tacos at a taco deli.
[00:39:15.868 --> 00:39:19.549]  And this lady walks over and she gets in my face, starts calling me all these names.
[00:39:19.549 --> 00:39:20.349]  And I just ignore it.
[00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:22.069]  I go, okay lady, thanks a lot.
[00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:29.571]  And her husband leans over while I'm sitting there and bumps me with his chest and stomach into my head and goes, shut the F up!
[00:39:29.571 --> 00:39:30.691]  And then I got up.
[00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:32.811]  I didn't touch him.
[00:39:32.811 --> 00:39:36.552]  And I started talking to him.
[00:39:36.552 --> 00:39:41.313]  They begin to panic and go, how dare you say this to us?
[00:39:41.313 --> 00:39:42.994]  Get away from us in front of everyone.
[00:39:42.994 --> 00:39:44.674]  They just come over and assaulted me.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.284]  I mean, they got rammed into me and said, shut the F up!
[00:39:49.284 --> 00:39:50.665]  I get up, start talking.
[00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:51.747]  They start panicking.
[00:39:51.747 --> 00:39:53.569]  Oh my God, it's not, it's not like television.
[00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:54.590]  It's not a video game.
[00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:55.952]  He's really here.
[00:39:55.952 --> 00:39:56.673]  And all of a sudden...
[00:39:57.898 --> 00:40:06.563]  Three other men and four other women who are sitting right outside the window, I'm sitting up against the window, run in and start going, F you racist!
[00:40:06.563 --> 00:40:07.364]  F you fascist!
[00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:12.847]  I'm trying to get my phone going and it's so overfilled with data it's not videotaping and I'm sitting there.
[00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:18.010]  I got part of it on tape and they start, one guy was like probably 6'5", he goes, you got a problem?
[00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.351]  And I said, you know what?
[00:40:19.351 --> 00:40:19.711]  I do.
[00:40:19.711 --> 00:40:20.332]  Go ahead, let's go.
[00:40:21.172 --> 00:40:22.313]  Let's go!
[00:40:22.313 --> 00:40:23.813]  And the other guys are like, I'm a veteran.
[00:40:23.813 --> 00:40:26.414]  I was like, all of you, let's go!
[00:40:26.414 --> 00:40:28.235]  And I didn't start the fight.
[00:40:28.235 --> 00:40:30.096]  But man, I mean, give me a break.
[00:40:30.096 --> 00:40:37.099]  You guys, the mere fact there was four of you against me, it had been total governors off.
[00:40:37.099 --> 00:40:39.560]  It had been not a pretty situation.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.541]  And I'm not sitting here as a tough guy.
[00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:48.064]  I can't order tacos without your wife cussing at me and you cussing at me and bumping me.
[00:40:48.064 --> 00:40:49.765]  And then the minute I get up,
[00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:53.112]  And start talking back.
[00:40:53.112 --> 00:40:54.613]  And by the way, a very quiet voice.
[00:40:54.613 --> 00:40:59.175]  I leaned forward and I said, why are you in my face?
[00:40:59.175 --> 00:41:00.575]  This is America.
[00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:01.556]  Why did you just bump me?
[00:41:01.556 --> 00:41:02.916]  And why are you cussing?
[00:41:02.916 --> 00:41:06.057]  And they went, oh, oh, help.
[00:41:06.057 --> 00:41:06.638]  He's me.
[00:41:06.638 --> 00:41:09.079]  They went, oh, I hope you're proud of yourself.
[00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:13.581]  I remember they were like, Alex Jones, everyone.
[00:41:13.581 --> 00:41:16.342]  These people, it's like it was symbolic.
[00:41:17.301 --> 00:41:19.122]  That they were gonna bump me!
[00:41:19.122 --> 00:41:23.683]  And they were gonna tell me to sh- The little wimpy dude was gonna tell me to F off!
[00:41:23.683 --> 00:41:28.345]  And then the rest of his family, big and small, came to tell me to shut up!
[00:41:28.345 --> 00:41:33.807]  And I'll be honest, it felt good to just go... Well, let's go!
[00:41:33.807 --> 00:41:38.389]  And of course, none of them are willing to sign that check that they've been talking about.
[00:41:44.873 --> 00:41:45.714]  None of them!
[00:41:45.714 --> 00:41:46.414]  It's pathetic!
[00:41:46.414 --> 00:41:47.975]  It's not that I'm tough!
[00:41:47.975 --> 00:41:50.857]  It's that YOU ARE A BUNCH OF COWARDS!
[00:41:50.857 --> 00:41:53.939]  I wanted to add an expletive there, but I'm not gonna do it.
[00:41:53.939 --> 00:41:55.520]  I said no more Taylor Ward's name in vain.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.682]  Even though I don't take it as that, I will respect the odds and I'll do it.
[00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:06.707]  But, when I watch this next video of some 6'4", huge dude with a pink shirt going, I'M A WOMAN IF YOU!
[00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:09.529]  YOU COME OUTSIDE I'LL BEAT YOUR ASS!
[00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:15.702]  And it's some little liberal shopkeeper, probably 5'5", like, dude, I don't mean the offense.
[00:42:15.702 --> 00:42:16.923]  Oh, you mean no offense!
[00:42:16.923 --> 00:42:25.768]  Even after the guy says, I mean no offense, this linebacker with breasts wants to piss in his face and make him submit.
[00:42:25.768 --> 00:42:29.430]  And I love even the Daily Caller.
[00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.751]  Transgender woman.
[00:42:30.751 --> 00:42:31.692]  It's not a woman.
[00:42:31.692 --> 00:42:33.613]  It's a man.
[00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:39.677]  Transgender woman threatens to take it outside when GameStop employee uses the word, sir.
[00:42:41.218 --> 00:42:51.250]  You got some big square-jawed guy, looks like Frankenstein with a wig on, bellies up to your bar, and you're like, Roger Stolbeck, what can I do for you?
[00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.033]  How dare you say I'm a man?
[00:42:54.033 --> 00:42:57.357]  You walk outside, I'm gonna plaster your face on the concrete.
[00:42:59.164 --> 00:43:08.454]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.454 --> 00:43:11.337]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.337 --> 00:43:17.364]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.044 --> 00:43:24.289]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:30.593]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.593 --> 00:43:37.518]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:51.694]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.694 --> 00:43:55.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:55.959 --> 00:43:58.622]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:43:59.244 --> 00:44:01.605]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[00:46:00.103 --> 00:46:05.265]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[00:46:05.265 --> 00:46:07.206]  That's the globalist only hope.
[00:46:07.206 --> 00:46:26.413]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.

[00:46:52.427 --> 00:46:54.308]  To not just fight, but to expand.
[00:46:54.308 --> 00:46:55.989]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:46:55.989 --> 00:46:57.250]  I salute you all.

[00:47:02.794 --> 00:47:05.456]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.895 --> 00:47:32.384]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:47:32.384 --> 00:47:36.748]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:36.748 --> 00:47:40.932]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:47:40.932 --> 00:47:42.533]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:43.464 --> 00:47:45.545]  Well, I was just in there during the break.
[00:47:45.545 --> 00:47:50.028]  Epic live video from on top of cell tower, 100 feet over the ground.
[00:47:50.028 --> 00:47:54.011]  Ian Ferguson, who shot the number one video on the internet this weekend.
[00:47:55.647 --> 00:48:03.353]  This vape store clerk flipping out that he's wearing a Trump hat, that's coming up right now live on this Sunday edition.
[00:48:03.353 --> 00:48:08.017]  And again, you wear a Trump hat, you figure what it's like to be an Alex Jones or Donald Trump.
[00:48:08.017 --> 00:48:14.022]  I go out in public in many areas, people either buy my dinner and pat me on the back, or they try to physically attack me.
[00:48:14.022 --> 00:48:16.024]  But since I've mentioned it, here's DailyCaller.com.
[00:48:16.024 --> 00:48:18.606]  Transgender woman threatens to take it outside.
[00:48:18.606 --> 00:48:21.929]  It's not a woman, it's a big dude with giant shoulders.
[00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:36.608]  When GameStop employee uses the word, sir, again, this is a big dude, looks like a big dude, big square job, looks like, again, Frankenstein, and then starts getting really threatening.
[00:48:36.608 --> 00:48:38.669]  He's not just acting like a dude, he's acting like a jerk.
[00:48:38.669 --> 00:48:39.029]  Here it is.
[00:48:40.868 --> 00:48:45.192]  Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.
[00:48:45.192 --> 00:48:47.214]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[00:48:47.214 --> 00:48:48.235]  It is ma'am.
[00:48:48.235 --> 00:48:49.896]  I can call the police if you'd like me to.
[00:48:49.896 --> 00:48:50.937]  You need to settle down.
[00:48:50.937 --> 00:48:53.800]  You need to settle down and mind your business, okay?
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.822]  Ma'am, once again, ma'am.
[00:48:55.822 --> 00:48:57.063]  I said both of you.
[00:48:57.063 --> 00:48:58.524]  No, you said sir.
[00:48:58.524 --> 00:48:59.585]  Once again, it's ma'am.
[00:48:59.585 --> 00:49:01.687]  I actually said both of you guys, Mr. General.
[00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:03.789]  Right beforehand, you said sir.
[00:49:06.406 --> 00:49:07.146]  Take it outside!
[00:49:07.146 --> 00:49:10.347]  If you want to call me sir again, I will show you a f***ing sir!
[00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:22.531]  I need your corporate number, because I'm going to call them and talk about how it's misgendered several times in this store.
[00:49:22.531 --> 00:49:24.572]  Misgendered, which is a law in California.
[00:49:24.572 --> 00:49:27.533]  Starts kicking stuff over.
[00:49:27.533 --> 00:49:28.953]  It just goes on and on.
[00:49:28.953 --> 00:49:31.414]  But I want to get to our special guest, big exclusive here.
[00:49:31.974 --> 00:49:33.055]  Let's play a minute or two.
[00:49:33.055 --> 00:49:34.056]  It's like a four minute video.
[00:49:34.056 --> 00:49:35.497]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:49:35.497 --> 00:49:37.219]  Tens of millions of views online.
[00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:39.321]  There's a RogerReport.com linking to it.
[00:49:39.321 --> 00:49:45.026]  Unhinged leftist has mental breakdown, refuses service to Trump supporter in vape shop.
[00:49:45.026 --> 00:49:50.751]  We're going to find out what happened before, what happened after, but here is part of that video.
[00:49:50.751 --> 00:49:55.915]  Here we are at Exhale Vapor City in Tucker, Georgia, and I have just been asked to leave the store.
[00:49:57.082 --> 00:49:57.902]  He greeted me.
[00:49:57.902 --> 00:49:58.682]  That was nice.
[00:49:58.682 --> 00:50:00.643]  I did find the item that I wanted.
[00:50:00.643 --> 00:50:03.163]  And the next thing he said was that he'd like me to leave.
[00:50:03.163 --> 00:50:07.304]  If you do not stop recording in my store, I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave now.
[00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.304]  Please call the police.
[00:50:08.304 --> 00:50:10.005]  That would be awesome.
[00:50:10.005 --> 00:50:10.545]  That'd be awesome.
[00:50:10.545 --> 00:50:12.385]  We can call Fox 5 and all sorts of stuff.
[00:50:12.385 --> 00:50:12.825]  I'd like to.
[00:50:12.825 --> 00:50:14.205]  He's got to protect himself from this lumbag.
[00:50:14.205 --> 00:50:16.146]  I'd like to purchase something here.
[00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:19.547]  Please do call your boss because I will be calling corporate.
[00:50:19.547 --> 00:50:20.147]  Go for it.
[00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:24.688]  I am looking forward to releasing this video because I just want to purchase something.
[00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:26.228]  F*** off!
[00:50:26.228 --> 00:50:26.488]  F*** off!
[00:50:34.072 --> 00:50:37.934]  He's virtue signaling in front of a black guy who just thinks he's an idiot.
[00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:41.276]  A racist white guy obsessed with racing and Trump supports racism.
[00:50:41.276 --> 00:50:42.197]  Let's stop there.
[00:50:42.197 --> 00:50:43.758]  We'll play more of the video when we get to the next hour.
[00:50:43.758 --> 00:50:49.721]  But he's on top, on his break, on top a cell tower, working on it.
[00:50:49.721 --> 00:50:50.662]  He's Ian Ferguson.
[00:50:50.662 --> 00:50:51.883]  I love how on a Sunday night,
[00:50:52.623 --> 00:50:53.944]  The second last day of the year.
[00:50:53.944 --> 00:50:59.926]  This guy is working for his family, and we've got the exclusive with him right now.
[00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:03.507]  I want to get into what happened, what happened before you started taping.
[00:51:03.507 --> 00:51:04.547]  It was smart for you to do that.
[00:51:04.547 --> 00:51:06.688]  Halftime, I forget when this happens.
[00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:09.489]  So thank you for joining us, Ian Ferguson.
[00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:10.789]  Hey!
[00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:12.090]  Not just Sunday, it's my birthday.
[00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:13.430]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.991]  Good, brother.
[00:51:13.991 --> 00:51:14.831]  Are you familiar with the show?
[00:51:15.993 --> 00:51:17.494]  Man, I've been watching you forever.
[00:51:17.494 --> 00:51:19.315]  I'm sorry what they did to you on YouTube, man.
[00:51:19.315 --> 00:51:20.636]  That's some bullshit.
[00:51:20.636 --> 00:51:21.056]  It's alright.
[00:51:21.056 --> 00:51:23.498]  We're going to delay that.
[00:51:23.498 --> 00:51:25.519]  We're on a lot of radio and TV stations.
[00:51:25.519 --> 00:51:26.620]  Wherever you want to start, my friend.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.501]  We appreciate you while you're up there working on top.
[00:51:28.501 --> 00:51:30.222]  I can see the cell tower right there you're hanging on.
[00:51:30.222 --> 00:51:32.363]  I mean, describe what happened.
[00:51:32.363 --> 00:51:32.724]  I'm down.
[00:51:32.724 --> 00:51:33.504]  I'm on the ground now.
[00:51:33.504 --> 00:51:35.045]  Earlier, you were up there.
[00:51:35.045 --> 00:51:36.306]  We should have had you on when you were up there.
[00:51:36.306 --> 00:51:37.807]  Sorry.
[00:51:37.807 --> 00:51:38.948]  That's what we were aiming for.
[00:51:38.948 --> 00:51:40.148]  It didn't work out.
[00:51:40.148 --> 00:51:40.549]  It's alright.
[00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.809]  Go ahead.
[00:51:42.436 --> 00:51:44.537]  All right, so what can I tell you, man?
[00:51:44.537 --> 00:51:45.458]  I want to talk all about it.
[00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:46.418]  What's up?
[00:51:46.418 --> 00:51:50.160]  Well, no, you described going in, you're trying to get your wife some strawberry vape.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.301]  I mean, what unfolded?
[00:51:52.301 --> 00:51:57.003]  Well, look, so I've been going there for years, and I've actually got a story about this place.
[00:51:57.003 --> 00:52:06.688]  It's pretty cool, but I was just standing there for a couple minutes waiting on him to get done with the customer, and they come up from the back of the store, and he greeted me a second time.
[00:52:07.438 --> 00:52:11.782]  And then as soon as he got a real good look at me, he said, nah, you can go ahead and leave the store.
[00:52:11.782 --> 00:52:12.683]  And I knew it was on.
[00:52:12.683 --> 00:52:17.227]  I grabbed the phone, turned on the video, and it just ran.
[00:52:17.227 --> 00:52:24.253]  Well, again, if someone doesn't put on an Infowars.com shirt or a Trump shirt, they don't know how bad it is.
[00:52:24.253 --> 00:52:26.535]  But you put the uniform on.
[00:52:26.535 --> 00:52:29.077]  Were you thinking that when you went in?
[00:52:29.077 --> 00:52:29.698]  What unfolded?
[00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:38.894]  Um, you know, honestly, I had that thought as I was getting out of the truck that something felt different about it this time.
[00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:41.716]  You know, I've been in and out of that store for years now.
[00:52:41.716 --> 00:52:50.282]  But, uh, yes, I definitely had a, I don't know, premonition, goose pimples, whatever you want to call it.
[00:52:50.282 --> 00:52:52.304]  Yeah, something felt different.
[00:52:52.304 --> 00:52:54.805]  Well, it's definitely the number one video right now on YouTube.
[00:52:56.526 --> 00:53:02.390]  I mean, obviously the video picks part of it, but this guy like slapping, he's hitting you, he's attacking you, you're being very calm.
[00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.833]  I mean, what was that like?
[00:53:05.833 --> 00:53:08.235]  Honestly, it was more exhilarating than anything.
[00:53:08.235 --> 00:53:11.457]  I mean, the guy's not a credible threat.
[00:53:11.457 --> 00:53:12.518]  I've been in trouble.
[00:53:12.518 --> 00:53:14.299]  I've been in danger.
[00:53:14.299 --> 00:53:16.440]  And he was more laughable than anything.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.202]  I feel bad for the guy.
[00:53:18.202 --> 00:53:19.242]  He done ruined his life.
[00:53:19.242 --> 00:53:22.805]  He's home somewhere not working right now.
[00:53:22.805 --> 00:53:23.705]  He did get fired.
[00:53:26.883 --> 00:53:27.704]  You live in Atlanta.
[00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:30.946]  How often do you go out and wear Trump paraphernalia?
[00:53:30.946 --> 00:53:32.107]  Oh, all the time.
[00:53:32.107 --> 00:53:34.309]  All the time.
[00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:40.754]  As soon as I found out that it could potentially trigger somebody, I knew I wanted to be part of that.
[00:53:40.754 --> 00:53:44.237]  Just something about the strength of the message, Make America Great Again.
[00:53:44.237 --> 00:53:46.419]  We're united.
[00:53:46.419 --> 00:53:47.620]  There's a network of us out there.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.482]  They say we're the silent majority, and that is so far from the truth.
[00:53:52.131 --> 00:53:58.394]  Well, I've been asking my questions, Ian Ferguson, but I want you to specifically, obviously you know it's been the top story for two days on the Red Report.
[00:53:58.394 --> 00:54:01.596]  It's been seen millions of times on a bunch of different platforms.
[00:54:01.596 --> 00:54:04.937]  And this is happening everywhere to Trump supporters when they're physically attacked.
[00:54:04.937 --> 00:54:06.658]  I'm glad you showed this.
[00:54:06.658 --> 00:54:12.661]  What do you think is going to come out of this?
[00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:13.662]  I couldn't really tell you.
[00:54:13.662 --> 00:54:17.023]  I'm not prescient.
[00:54:17.023 --> 00:54:18.624]  I don't see the future.
[00:54:18.624 --> 00:54:20.685]  I didn't see this phone call happening yesterday.
[00:54:22.788 --> 00:54:25.030]  I'd like to see a little bit more tolerance.
[00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:32.177]  I'd really like to see some of the Trump supporters out there grow some backbones and start standing up for themselves.
[00:54:32.177 --> 00:54:35.079]  The days of feelings running the world are over.
[00:54:35.079 --> 00:54:37.922]  And it's about time for people to wake up and realize that.
[00:54:37.922 --> 00:54:41.105]  Logic runs the train now.
[00:54:41.105 --> 00:54:43.807]  The video is like three and a half minutes long.
[00:54:43.807 --> 00:54:46.950]  What happened once the clip went dark?
[00:54:48.907 --> 00:54:53.449]  Um, you know, I haven't really watched it that much, but I remember what happened right around that time.
[00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:56.451]  Let's see what was at the end of it.
[00:54:56.451 --> 00:55:05.556]  At the end of it, the other customer, he was like, he was telling the guy behind the counter, man, it's about money, about skin color, what color is your cash?
[00:55:05.556 --> 00:55:08.037]  And he just wasn't going for it.
[00:55:08.037 --> 00:55:08.737]  It was getting worse.
[00:55:08.737 --> 00:55:17.321]  It was time for me to go on out of there before I got in trouble.
[00:55:17.321 --> 00:55:18.222]  Yeah, no, very end.
[00:55:19.048 --> 00:55:20.591]  Let's see, I told him, go fuck yourself.
[00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:22.513]  Trump's the president.
[00:55:22.513 --> 00:55:28.383]  The other customer, he was just talking about, man, my cash is green, his cash is green.
[00:55:29.678 --> 00:55:30.959]  Well, let me bring this up.
[00:55:30.959 --> 00:55:35.900]  I mean, look, if I was a small cake company owner and people just wanted me to put two dudes on the cake, I'd do it.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:39.741]  But I get small companies have a right to say no, but big companies especially shouldn't.
[00:55:39.741 --> 00:55:40.721]  You're wearing a hat.
[00:55:40.721 --> 00:55:42.502]  Why would he refuse you service?
[00:55:42.502 --> 00:55:44.203]  Why would he go so hysterical?
[00:55:44.203 --> 00:55:47.103]  I mean, obviously he's been fired now.
[00:55:47.103 --> 00:55:48.664]  This is blown up in their face.
[00:55:48.664 --> 00:55:51.285]  A lot of places the left would actually celebrate what happened to you.
[00:55:51.285 --> 00:55:56.726]  I mean, they are nationwide saying that guy's a hero, the leftists.
[00:55:56.726 --> 00:55:57.887]  That's hilarious.
[00:56:00.476 --> 00:56:04.079]  I mean, he stood up for what he believed in the same way I did.
[00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:05.841]  His was just a little bit more laughable.
[00:56:05.841 --> 00:56:20.353]  Let me ask you this, at a certain point you get mad after he slaps you, it looks like for a second time, correct me if I'm wrong, then you say, come on punk, do it again, so you did get a little hot there, what got you hot at that moment?
[00:56:20.353 --> 00:56:26.618]  You know, I really can't put my finger, seven times through anger management, Alex, I'm a reformed criminal.
[00:56:28.508 --> 00:56:33.811]  As soon as he took the second swipe, I really just wanted to put my hands on him.
[00:56:33.811 --> 00:56:35.232]  Look at the video.
[00:56:35.232 --> 00:56:36.693]  He kind of looks like a beta male.
[00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.894]  You don't look like a wimp.
[00:56:38.894 --> 00:56:39.455]  I know the look.
[00:56:39.455 --> 00:56:40.956]  I mean, you don't look like a wimp.
[00:56:40.956 --> 00:56:43.017]  What was he thinking?
[00:56:43.017 --> 00:56:44.398]  I couldn't tell you what he was thinking.
[00:56:44.398 --> 00:56:51.262]  I don't believe that I give off the impression that I'm somebody to play around with.
[00:56:51.262 --> 00:56:52.803]  But hey, he wanted to play games, so...
[00:56:54.108 --> 00:56:55.009]  There it is.
[00:56:55.009 --> 00:56:57.731]  But what about the poor black guy that he keeps virtue signaling?
[00:56:57.731 --> 00:57:00.053]  I know he called you the n-word, the white guy did.
[00:57:00.053 --> 00:57:04.677]  He's hopping around, the black guy's like waving his hands around like this is ridiculous.
[00:57:04.677 --> 00:57:10.842]  Man, I could see the look of pain on his face that he just didn't want to be involved in any of it.
[00:57:10.842 --> 00:57:12.523]  It had nothing to do with him.
[00:57:12.523 --> 00:57:15.526]  He just wanted to buy whatever it was he was trying to buy.
[00:57:15.526 --> 00:57:21.751]  He even got into the argument at the end talking about, man, my cash is green, so is his, let's just do this thing.
[00:57:22.535 --> 00:57:25.440]  Oh, so tell us about that when we come back in two minutes.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.746]  So at the end of the day, the black guy was like, yeah, dude, sell him his stuff.
[00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:33.612]  Yeah, no, he knew what was up.
[00:57:33.612 --> 00:57:34.373]  Kid was just going nuts.
[00:57:35.979 --> 00:57:38.542]  And again, if it was black people doing all this, I'd say it, but it's not.
[00:57:38.542 --> 00:57:46.590]  It's a bunch of weird white wimps that are looking for a fight, and then once the fight starts, they crap their britches and run to mommy.
[00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.253]  We'll be back with Ian Ferguson.
[00:57:49.253 --> 00:57:54.418]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[00:57:54.418 --> 00:57:55.619]  That's the globalist's only hope.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:15.562]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[00:58:15.802 --> 00:58:22.068]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[00:58:22.068 --> 00:58:27.713]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[00:58:27.713 --> 00:58:30.215]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:31.336]  Every order gets free shipping.
[00:58:31.336 --> 00:58:35.240]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:41.551]  Allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year.
[00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:43.454]  To not just fight, but to expand.
[00:58:43.454 --> 00:58:44.155]  We're on the march.
[00:58:44.155 --> 00:58:45.137]  The empire's on the run.
[00:58:45.137 --> 00:58:46.379]  I salute you all.
[00:58:46.379 --> 00:58:47.882]  Now please take action at m4store.com.
[00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:54.790]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:58.253]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:58:58.253 --> 00:59:00.035]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:59:00.035 --> 00:59:03.298]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:59:03.298 --> 00:59:10.084]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:59:10.084 --> 00:59:15.169]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:59:15.509 --> 00:59:21.610]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.591]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:59:24.591 --> 00:59:25.671]  I want to keep going.
[00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:29.512]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:59:29.512 --> 00:59:31.532]  I want to push all the way.
[00:59:31.532 --> 00:59:32.812]  I've committed to do that.
[00:59:32.812 --> 00:59:33.892]  I've prayed for that.
[00:59:33.892 --> 00:59:35.533]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:59:35.533 --> 00:59:38.473]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:59:38.473 --> 00:59:39.794]  I will never falter.
[00:59:39.794 --> 00:59:41.814]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:59:42.114 --> 00:59:43.055]  I physically will.
[00:59:43.055 --> 00:59:53.790]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWarshore.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.793 --> 01:00:41.054]  This is not what your country can do for you.
[01:00:43.092 --> 01:00:55.667]  Well, there's been a lot of red-blooded Americans that built this country, but 30 minutes ago, when they were first getting this guest on, he's up on top of the cell tower, and he's showing his shots down on the ground, like, getting him on, but he had to get off the tower by nighttime.
[01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:58.950]  So now, Ian Ferguson is in his truck, about to leave for the night.
[01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:21.367]  And I just hope that he gets this live interview later uploaded to his own YouTube channel with millions of views on him going to this vape shop in Atlanta and some libtard, I think they're calling him vapetard, blows up at him in front of a black guy and starts calling you the n-word and the black guy's like, I know it's on the video, he's like, hey dude you need to stop it, just sell him his stuff.
[01:01:21.367 --> 01:01:26.691]  What is, how would you quantify the liberal derangement syndrome that's going on?
[01:01:30.692 --> 01:01:32.033]  How would I quantify that?
[01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:34.075]  I mean, where is it going?
[01:01:34.075 --> 01:01:36.637]  Because they're getting crazier.
[01:01:36.637 --> 01:01:37.337]  Aren't they, though?
[01:01:37.337 --> 01:01:38.718]  Well, look, here's the thing.
[01:01:38.718 --> 01:01:45.984]  Alright, so, they've been raised, everybody participates, everybody gets a trophy, everybody gets a ribbon.
[01:01:45.984 --> 01:01:47.245]  They've never been told no.
[01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:51.689]  Dr. Spock got a hold of their parents in the 80s and messed up their game.
[01:01:51.689 --> 01:01:59.535]  So, when they run across an alpha that doesn't have a problem telling them no and is firm in it, they've got nowhere to resort but
[01:02:00.696 --> 01:02:04.139]  Just a very basic scream mentality.
[01:02:04.139 --> 01:02:05.800]  It takes them right back to childhood.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.942]  It's the only thing I could figure.
[01:02:07.942 --> 01:02:11.044]  Well, you're definitely, you say you're not that smart, then you're the idiot savant.
[01:02:11.044 --> 01:02:12.685]  I say you're savant.
[01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:13.206]  That's it.
[01:02:13.206 --> 01:02:14.667]  It's toddler behavior.
[01:02:14.667 --> 01:02:18.570]  It's literal screaming.
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:20.791]  Like I've had a bump me and hit me.
[01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:23.613]  And then when I say, hey, watch it, they go, oh my God, you're threatening me.
[01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:25.675]  It's like, no, you just ran into me.
[01:02:27.079 --> 01:02:29.660]  Yeah, no, it's very animalistic.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:34.582]  You see the same thing when a man gets backed into a corner and has nowhere to go?
[01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:36.983]  It's just all the primal comes out.
[01:02:36.983 --> 01:02:39.224]  It is what it is.
[01:02:39.224 --> 01:02:42.066]  But they think they're backed into a corner, but they're such betas.
[01:02:42.066 --> 01:02:44.147]  And they're trying to back us into a corner.
[01:02:44.147 --> 01:02:47.428]  And they keep thinking as they double down intimidation, we're going to give up.
[01:02:47.428 --> 01:02:52.170]  And then as we intensify the fight, they get really freaked out.
[01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:54.731]  Most people aren't bred for conflict.
[01:02:54.731 --> 01:02:55.812]  Most people don't handle it well.
[01:02:56.514 --> 01:02:58.715]  Conflict isn't, it's not comfortable.
[01:02:58.715 --> 01:03:01.016]  Change equals pain and all that.
[01:03:01.016 --> 01:03:02.396]  But listen, I've been asking the questions here.
[01:03:02.396 --> 01:03:04.757]  I want to do this segment and then actually get back to your wife.
[01:03:04.757 --> 01:03:08.499]  Did your wife finally get her strawberry vape?
[01:03:08.499 --> 01:03:09.199]  Yes.
[01:03:09.199 --> 01:03:12.200]  I actually went right down the street to another vape shop.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.602]  I was on the way home and just saw this like little bitty kind of shack looking thing and I went in there.
[01:03:17.602 --> 01:03:19.563]  I don't know if you've seen the second video.
[01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:20.824]  There's actually three of them now.
[01:03:20.824 --> 01:03:24.365]  But the second one was at a video shop right across the street.
[01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:27.367]  Really nice girl.
[01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:28.027]  Mixed girl.
[01:03:28.027 --> 01:03:30.689]  She's a liberal Democrat.
[01:03:30.689 --> 01:03:33.391]  And come to find out, she'd never been in trouble with the law whatsoever.
[01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:35.552]  And there she is standing there talking to me about it.
[01:03:35.552 --> 01:03:36.993]  She was just floored at the video.
[01:03:36.993 --> 01:03:38.675]  She was the first person that saw it, as a matter of fact.
[01:03:38.675 --> 01:03:39.235]  Her name's Casey.
[01:03:39.235 --> 01:03:42.097]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:43.258]  Your video cuts out.
[01:03:43.258 --> 01:03:44.058]  Why did it cut out?
[01:03:44.058 --> 01:03:47.581]  And then what happened next in there with this guy that wouldn't sell you strawberry vape?
[01:03:48.689 --> 01:03:50.130]  Oh, nothing happened after that.
[01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.851]  I was cutting the video off as I was leaving.
[01:03:51.851 --> 01:03:57.595]  Right about the time I gave him the finger and told him that Trump was still his president, I was packing it up to leave.
[01:03:57.595 --> 01:04:00.937]  But you did try to let him sell you the product.
[01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.939]  Yeah, man, I tried to bargain with him.
[01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.600]  Dude, give me the thing and I won't call the cops.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.581]  I won't call corporate.
[01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.782]  Just do your job.
[01:04:08.782 --> 01:04:10.123]  He wasn't having it.
[01:04:10.123 --> 01:04:10.824]  Just wasn't having it.
[01:04:12.347 --> 01:04:22.330]  He seemed totally disconnected because even if you're a tough guy on the wrong day or you get your ass kicked, he's like starting to fight with a pretty tough looking dude and yelling N-word out.
[01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:23.410]  You know, that's on the video too.
[01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:27.091]  What was that about?
[01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:28.632]  Virtue signaling?
[01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:35.374]  Potentially, maybe he was trying to gas up his customer to make a better sale and convince the customer that he was
[01:04:36.867 --> 01:04:37.447]  I don't know.
[01:04:37.447 --> 01:04:39.589]  On the right side of the race garden?
[01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:40.009]  Whatever.
[01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.892]  Didn't look like the black dude bought into it.
[01:04:42.892 --> 01:04:43.893]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:43.893 --> 01:04:49.558]  One more segment with our guest where he goes down the road to be with his wife after he works on cell towers all day on Sunday.
[01:04:49.558 --> 01:04:50.799]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:52.781]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:52.781 --> 01:04:53.341]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:58.206]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.206 --> 01:04:59.727]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:03.971]  This life is a test.
[01:05:03.971 --> 01:05:16.198]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing us being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[01:05:16.198 --> 01:05:26.184]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:30.347]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[01:05:31.277 --> 01:05:37.599]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing and you tend to see it and that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:41.420]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.700]  2018 has been insane.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:49.583]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:05:49.583 --> 01:05:53.284]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:57.345]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.730]  You've got it.
[01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:06.254]  The Christmas is coming to you.
[01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:10.637]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.637 --> 01:06:16.320]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:20.535 --> 01:06:26.399]  Well, I'm really glad that our producer Daria and others got the gentleman Ian Ferguson on.
[01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:30.321]  He's been the number one story this weekend on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:34.404]  It's one of the top videos on YouTube, Facebook, it's everywhere.
[01:06:34.404 --> 01:06:37.826]  It's the top commented article on InfoWars.com.
[01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:41.989]  And he just walks into a vape shop in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:06:41.989 --> 01:06:44.431]  He's a hard-working guy that works on cell towers.
[01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:48.153]  And again, a lot of you already saw this, but I'm recapping for new viewers.
[01:06:48.153 --> 01:06:50.395]  We have new listeners every 10 seconds.
[01:06:50.395 --> 01:06:56.419]  And he just shows up, and this dude flips out on him and says, get out of here, racist.
[01:06:56.419 --> 01:06:58.180]  Get out of here, N-word.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.022]  There's a black dude in the video going, hey, man.
[01:07:01.022 --> 01:07:02.683]  He's trying to hit a big vape shop.
[01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:06.744]  Hey dude, just sell him his stuff and the black dude totally gets it.
[01:07:06.744 --> 01:07:15.745]  It's, again, it's weird white people who are leftists think it's like a magic word like hocus pocus or what is that, what's that guy's name?
[01:07:15.745 --> 01:07:16.885]  Harry Potter.
[01:07:16.885 --> 01:07:22.466]  He's got some magic word and you say it and they just think it does everything.
[01:07:22.466 --> 01:07:29.368]  So we'll tell you this gentleman's YouTube and his Facebook so you can follow it, but he's just a regular, you know, citizen out there doing it.
[01:07:29.368 --> 01:07:30.648]  Here's a video clip of what happens.
[01:07:31.513 --> 01:07:37.799]  Here we are at Exhale Vapor City in Tucker, Georgia, and I have just been asked to leave the store.
[01:07:37.799 --> 01:07:38.459]  He greeted me.
[01:07:38.459 --> 01:07:39.400]  That was nice.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.024]  I did find the item that I wanted, and the next thing he said was that he'd like me to leave.
[01:07:44.024 --> 01:07:48.028]  If you do not stop recording in my store, I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave now.
[01:07:48.028 --> 01:07:48.569]  Please call the police.
[01:07:48.569 --> 01:07:50.170]  That would be awesome.
[01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.291]  That would be awesome.
[01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:53.133]  We can call Fox 5 and all sorts of stuff.
[01:07:53.133 --> 01:07:53.533]  I'd like to...
[01:07:54.634 --> 01:07:56.856]  I would like to purchase something here.
[01:07:56.856 --> 01:08:00.258]  Please do call your boss because I will be calling corporate.
[01:08:00.258 --> 01:08:00.858]  Go for it.
[01:08:00.858 --> 01:08:05.382]  I am looking forward to releasing this video because I just want to purchase something.
[01:08:11.405 --> 01:08:15.627]  This goes on for another three minutes.
[01:08:15.627 --> 01:08:26.251]  It's up on Infowars.com, but you've seen those thug life videos of myself or Trump or Pence or Rand Paul when like boom the spliffs pop out and yeah boom boom.
[01:08:26.251 --> 01:08:38.656]  You deserve like 14 pipes, 25 sunglasses, everything else here, Ian Ferguson, because you absolutely, people watch the whole video, you totally pimp that guy.
[01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:43.027]  Yeah.
[01:08:43.027 --> 01:08:48.348]  In retrospect, what I did was set myself up for a whole bunch of trouble.
[01:08:48.348 --> 01:08:50.409]  I could have gone back to jail real easy.
[01:08:50.409 --> 01:08:56.730]  It wouldn't have taken much for all that anger management to slip, and here Ian is back in prison.
[01:08:56.730 --> 01:09:05.773]  So, I appreciate the credit and the gas in my head, but in reality, I've got to stop putting myself in these situations.
[01:09:07.818 --> 01:09:15.544]  No, but this is America, and Trump is our president, and you know, you have a right to wear a red, white, and blue damn shirt.
[01:09:15.544 --> 01:09:21.509]  I mean, you know, do we have a country left if you can't do this without some jerk getting in your face?
[01:09:21.509 --> 01:09:22.570]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:24.131]  It's freedom of speech.
[01:09:24.131 --> 01:09:25.052]  God bless America.
[01:09:25.052 --> 01:09:26.293]  I'll wear what I want.
[01:09:26.293 --> 01:09:30.016]  I'll roll down the street in one roller skate and a pink thong if I want to.
[01:09:30.016 --> 01:09:30.517]  It's America.
[01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:32.692]  And yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:09:32.692 --> 01:09:34.494]  He's got no right to say one word.
[01:09:34.494 --> 01:09:36.875]  Well, no, he's got every right to say whatever he wants.
[01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:37.456]  He's got a right.
[01:09:37.456 --> 01:09:40.298]  He has no right to attack you twice.
[01:09:40.298 --> 01:09:41.139]  That's true.
[01:09:41.139 --> 01:09:44.581]  Well, I'm glad you had restraint because I've had him slap me in the head too.
[01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:49.165]  It's never that hard or pour coffee on me because I get I'm winning by letting him do it.
[01:09:49.165 --> 01:09:53.468]  But how did you keep yourself from punching?
[01:09:53.468 --> 01:09:54.169]  I've been to prison.
[01:09:55.153 --> 01:09:57.273]  That's how I kept myself from doing it.
[01:09:57.273 --> 01:10:03.735]  You get locked behind the walls with a couple guys that want to rape you in the middle of the night and have to poke them full of holes, and you won't ever want to go back.
[01:10:03.735 --> 01:10:06.495]  I promise you.
[01:10:06.495 --> 01:10:08.636]  And that's the difference, because you've been in the real world.
[01:10:08.636 --> 01:10:11.936]  That SJW, I bet, still lives in mama's basement.
[01:10:11.936 --> 01:10:19.337]  And I'm not bashing folks living with their mama, but the point is, this guy literally doesn't even know who he's messing with.
[01:10:19.337 --> 01:10:21.798]  He doesn't, because I can see the video, I'm not just saying this, I can tell you're
[01:10:22.338 --> 01:10:22.618]  Absolutely.
[01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:23.119]  Absolutely.
[01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:50.925]  And I really can't speak to his mindset because I just, I don't follow it.
[01:10:50.925 --> 01:10:53.066]  There's no common ground for me to understand.
[01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:07.302]  I don't know.
[01:11:07.302 --> 01:11:12.166]  Honestly, I'm considering starting a GoFundMe for him, and I feel bad for the guy.
[01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:13.927]  I know what it's like to be out of work.
[01:11:13.927 --> 01:11:28.039]  Let me tell you, I would pay for the hotel and the time with that guy, and if he would do an interview with you, and like basically have a meeting, almost like Dr. Whatever, where you're like, hey, I'm a human being, he's a human being, and we deprogram him.
[01:11:28.039 --> 01:11:34.984]  Would you be willing to meet with him with cameras, and for you guys to try to rehabilitate him?
[01:11:34.984 --> 01:11:35.645]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:36.405 --> 01:11:37.827]  Hey, look, Alex, you let me know, man.
[01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.528]  I'm a big fan.
[01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:40.970]  You want me to help you do something?
[01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.812]  I got you.
[01:11:42.812 --> 01:11:46.556]  Well, I mean, I want to try to deprogram one of these people.
[01:11:46.556 --> 01:11:48.698]  Best of luck.
[01:11:48.698 --> 01:11:51.882]  You better call CIA MKUltra.
[01:11:52.785 --> 01:11:53.646]  No, I agree.
[01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:54.706]  Well, let me say this then.
[01:11:54.706 --> 01:12:04.173]  You made a lot of great points, Ian Ferguson, going into this vape shop being attacked by Lybtard, who we want to humanize, but they hate us so much that it's hard.
[01:12:04.173 --> 01:12:06.474]  They're like a crazy pit bull on PCP.
[01:12:06.474 --> 01:12:08.555]  In closing, you say you're not that smart.
[01:12:08.555 --> 01:12:09.596]  You're damn smart.
[01:12:09.596 --> 01:12:12.538]  What else do you want to add about what's going on on your YouTube, your Facebook?
[01:12:12.538 --> 01:12:15.260]  How folks follow you?
[01:12:17.645 --> 01:12:19.286]  Add me if you're not on that nonsense.
[01:12:19.286 --> 01:12:25.670]  Alright, I'm married, I've got kids, I'm not trying to get in any more trouble with the law, with my wife, none of that mess.
[01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:29.332]  Feel free to add me, follow me, just don't come with that BS.
[01:12:29.332 --> 01:12:35.996]  Beyond that, there's like a boycott going on for Exhale Vapes and that mess needs to stop.
[01:12:35.996 --> 01:12:37.337]  It's not their fault.
[01:12:37.337 --> 01:12:39.038]  It was this punk ginger that did this.
[01:12:39.038 --> 01:12:40.339]  It wasn't Exhale Vapes.
[01:12:40.339 --> 01:12:42.280]  Y'all stop boycotting them, alright?
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.461]  It's not a bad company.
[01:12:43.461 --> 01:12:44.021]  They're good people.
[01:12:45.439 --> 01:12:45.979]  And that's good.
[01:12:45.979 --> 01:12:47.040]  They fired him.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.902]  I mean, that's not their fault that they had this person.
[01:12:50.902 --> 01:12:54.465]  He had been shithead before they even tracked me down.
[01:12:54.465 --> 01:12:59.128]  I hadn't made it home before they were ringing my phone to let me know that he was gone.
[01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:01.529]  So, I mean, if anybody's wondering, yeah, they took care of it.
[01:13:01.529 --> 01:13:03.850]  They took care of it promptly.
[01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:07.132]  And then they called to find out what they could do to make my life easier.
[01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:14.217]  So... For new listeners that just tuned in, Ian Ferguson in Atlanta, recap in the next minute what happened for people that just tuned in.
[01:13:16.368 --> 01:13:23.336]  Recap, I went out in some Trump gear and a libtard melted down.
[01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:28.002]  I went to a vape shop and buddy refused me service and went to screaming like he was my super saiyan.
[01:13:28.002 --> 01:13:28.543]  It was crazy.
[01:13:28.543 --> 01:13:29.484]  It was crazy.
[01:13:31.553 --> 01:13:32.633]  Well, it's very, very sad.
[01:13:32.633 --> 01:13:36.675]  He's in his mom's basement right now, wishing he'd grown up being a man.
[01:13:36.675 --> 01:13:37.715]  Please come on the show tomorrow.
[01:13:37.715 --> 01:13:38.536]  I know you're probably working.
[01:13:38.536 --> 01:13:42.697]  Say hi to your wife for me, and we look forward to talking to you again.
[01:13:42.697 --> 01:13:44.518]  But thank you for videotaping us.
[01:13:44.518 --> 01:13:45.478]  We can all see it.
[01:13:45.478 --> 01:13:47.659]  Thank you, Ian Ferguson.
[01:13:47.659 --> 01:13:48.179]  Hey, man.
[01:13:48.179 --> 01:13:49.160]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:49.860]  I really appreciate it.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.761]  Appreciate you.
[01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:56.062]  Man, it is crazy how almost anybody we talk to is a listener.
[01:13:56.062 --> 01:13:57.103]  It is amazing.
[01:14:02.645 --> 01:14:06.827]  Man, I looked at that video and you got this little bitty nerd, like, threatening this big dude.
[01:14:06.827 --> 01:14:11.090]  And the guy's laughing at him and the guy doesn't get how close he's getting to getting clocked.
[01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:15.893]  And he just has no idea how he's, like, pushing and pushing and pushing.
[01:14:15.893 --> 01:14:17.194]  And that's what these people do.
[01:14:17.194 --> 01:14:20.576]  And that's why we don't want to smack them upside the head.
[01:14:20.576 --> 01:14:23.677]  We want to videotape them punching us.
[01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:28.020]  And a lot of people say, oh, you let them throw coffee on you, let them punch you.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.182]  Yeah, because I'm showing what a pack of cowards they are.
[01:14:32.864 --> 01:14:52.194]  Let me tell you, when they finally banned us off all the social networks, we had no fewer than eight different reporters live on air covering Antifa physically attacking men, women, and children in Portland, Oregon.
[01:14:52.194 --> 01:14:53.634]  They'd already banned all our main accounts.
[01:14:53.634 --> 01:14:59.778]  We had sub-accounts with millions of views that day, and it just showed the meth-head scum they are.
[01:14:59.778 --> 01:15:02.579]  And they got scared, and they banned it.
[01:15:04.377 --> 01:15:06.938]  It doesn't make me wanna give up that I'm being banned.
[01:15:06.938 --> 01:15:08.339]  I'm in the right.
[01:15:08.339 --> 01:15:11.421]  Of course I'm being banned.
[01:15:11.421 --> 01:15:25.828]  Google, Apple, all of them are on their knees to China, the biggest murderers in history of their own people, kissing their butts to get access to their market.
[01:15:25.828 --> 01:15:28.109]  They're scum of the earth.
[01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:29.990]  They should be easily defeated.
[01:15:31.118 --> 01:15:33.259]  You know, Trump tried to turn the economy off in two years.
[01:15:33.259 --> 01:15:34.579]  It happened.
[01:15:34.579 --> 01:15:37.180]  And he told you, you elect Democrats, they're gonna kill it.
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.121]  They're doing it now!
[01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:40.141]  And now they're blaming Trump!
[01:15:40.141 --> 01:15:42.322]  So, you know what, America?
[01:15:42.322 --> 01:15:50.605]  If you're that stupid, and you want some basement dweller to be the enforcer of the left, then okay, fine.
[01:15:50.605 --> 01:15:54.507]  I'm just here to make sure the alternative is laid out.
[01:15:54.507 --> 01:15:54.927]  We'll be back.

[01:17:57.904 --> 01:18:01.507]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:18:01.507 --> 01:18:03.289]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:18:03.289 --> 01:18:14.558]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:18:15.319 --> 01:18:24.125]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:30.470]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:35.573]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:35.573 --> 01:18:38.195]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:18:38.195 --> 01:18:39.916]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:44.720]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:49.887]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:18:49.887 --> 01:18:52.551]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:57.258]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:18:57.728 --> 01:19:08.315]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:19:08.315 --> 01:19:10.376]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:19:10.376 --> 01:19:13.238]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:19:13.238 --> 01:19:14.739]  It's made in the USA.
[01:19:14.739 --> 01:19:17.861]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:21.564]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:19:21.564 --> 01:19:23.626]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:33.354]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:19:33.354 --> 01:19:45.665]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:19:45.845 --> 01:19:50.149]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:53.453]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.
[01:19:53.453 --> 01:20:01.221]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:03.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.048 --> 01:20:14.730]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:22.854]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:22.854 --> 01:20:34.941]  So, in the West, and the Christian ethos, we believe in empowering the weak.
[01:20:34.941 --> 01:20:36.722]  That doesn't mean we believe in holding back the strong.
[01:20:40.965 --> 01:20:44.346]  And so we believe in letting people have their own freedom.
[01:20:44.346 --> 01:20:47.868]  That's free will.
[01:20:47.868 --> 01:20:52.549]  And I played this video earlier, but I'm going to play it one more time because it's so illustrative.
[01:20:52.549 --> 01:20:59.932]  Transgender woman threatens to take it outside when GameStop employee uses the server.
[01:20:59.932 --> 01:21:09.856]  It's like a six foot four, 250 pound person yelling and screaming and kicking over products.
[01:21:11.098 --> 01:21:20.204]  And getting in everybody's face because they supposedly have used the wrong pronoun.
[01:21:20.204 --> 01:21:25.808]  I mean, I'm still trying to figure out all this transgender stuff and I can't figure out the pronouns and all the rules.
[01:21:25.808 --> 01:21:30.271]  In California, you're arrested if you use the wrong gender name.
[01:21:30.271 --> 01:21:33.214]  I mean, if I want to call a woman a man, a man a woman, I should be able to.
[01:21:33.214 --> 01:21:37.897]  If I want to call a cat a dog, if I want to call a storm cloud an Easter bunny,
[01:21:39.173 --> 01:21:45.117]  I should be able to, but now it's into the hundreds and hundreds of pronouns.
[01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:58.386]  While Germany, I saw CNN reported yesterday, Germany's added a third gender, and I went to look at the article, and this person has a mutation and has both genitals, which happens in, you know, one out of a million people.
[01:21:58.386 --> 01:22:04.731]  And now with all the chemicals, it happens with more, and you're right, you're like, yeah, there actually are genders where people got
[01:22:07.441 --> 01:22:13.005]  Both male genitals, but they rarely have, even though it's rare to have this, a uterus and testicles.
[01:22:13.005 --> 01:22:15.848]  In fact, that's almost never found.
[01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:22.193]  So scientists go with whether you have uterus and ovaries or whether you have testicles.
[01:22:22.193 --> 01:22:31.961]  But the point is, is that a man that's six foot four and has got male genitals marches into a GameStop in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[01:22:33.328 --> 01:22:40.813]  And he sits back and he says, while you called me, sir, I'm going to take you outside.
[01:22:40.813 --> 01:22:42.254]  He's the bully.
[01:22:42.254 --> 01:22:43.414]  He's the bad guy.
[01:22:43.414 --> 01:22:46.737]  You know, this liberal looks like a total liberal.
[01:22:46.737 --> 01:22:50.819]  It's like, listen, I just said you guys, that's just a term.
[01:22:50.819 --> 01:22:51.480]  Shut up.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.282]  You said, sir.
[01:22:55.282 --> 01:22:58.344]  And that's just illustrative.
[01:22:58.344 --> 01:23:02.727]  Of how the left uses our openness as an open society.
[01:23:04.761 --> 01:23:14.351]  And the fact that we have deference, and we have tolerance, and we have hospitality.
[01:23:14.351 --> 01:23:21.739]  And because, let me tell you something, you go to China, gay people, homosexuals, are killed in China, are put in forced labor.
[01:23:23.511 --> 01:23:25.192]  You do any of that, they arrest you.
[01:23:25.192 --> 01:23:33.738]  But here, where it's all openly accepted, well, we better let drag queens talk to two-year-olds in preschool and tell them they're another sex.
[01:23:33.738 --> 01:23:36.259]  Their own parents would be perverts if they did that.
[01:23:36.259 --> 01:23:38.561]  If someone at a park did it, they'd be arrested.
[01:23:38.561 --> 01:23:44.745]  But if your two-year-old, your three-year-old, your four-year-old, your five-year-old is talked to by some person in a
[01:23:45.686 --> 01:23:50.530]  Dragon outfit or a vampire outfit, literally, telling them about their sex.
[01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:55.414]  Well, it's okay because we're all open and we're nice here.
[01:23:55.414 --> 01:24:04.321]  This is all the giant white flag that the system runs up.
[01:24:04.321 --> 01:24:06.222]  So I was going to play a bunch of clubs here.
[01:24:06.222 --> 01:24:10.606]  You know, I've just gotten lost in the fog here.
[01:24:10.606 --> 01:24:11.767]  What was the club we're about to play?
[01:24:11.767 --> 01:24:12.808]  I've got so much to cover.
[01:24:13.592 --> 01:24:17.875]  But the talk in my ear, what was it I was about to hit?
[01:24:17.875 --> 01:24:23.258]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, Emma Vigeland?
[01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:24.739]  Vigeland.
[01:24:24.739 --> 01:24:27.501]  I don't pay a lot of attention to media, period.
[01:24:27.501 --> 01:24:40.590]  I try to cover what's happening legislatively, but I remember when I got kicked off YouTube, Facebook, Twitter five months ago, like a million years ago, she was like, well, Jones has been taken off the internet, but it's really a right-wing plot to take everybody off.
[01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:42.071]  Total made-up crap.
[01:24:42.071 --> 01:24:43.032]  But then I saw
[01:24:44.127 --> 01:24:54.013]  This new video, like a week ago, and I forgot about it, but I told the producer, make me cover it, because she works for the anti-Christian genocidal group.
[01:24:54.013 --> 01:24:55.834]  I mean, that's what Young Turks means.
[01:24:55.834 --> 01:24:56.954]  She may not know it.
[01:24:56.954 --> 01:25:02.298]  She works for the George Soros Qatar dictatorship funded Young Turks.
[01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:09.222]  So I saw this video that said Alex Jones and Infowars admits they're fake.
[01:25:09.222 --> 01:25:11.383]  Can we put the name of the video on screen for folks?
[01:25:11.383 --> 01:25:12.203]  I'm paraphrasing.
[01:25:12.203 --> 01:25:12.824]  I'm going from memory.
[01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:18.339]  So she does this whole video and then she never shows text.
[01:25:18.339 --> 01:25:20.301]  She never shows a video.
[01:25:20.301 --> 01:25:22.843]  She never shows an audio.
[01:25:22.843 --> 01:25:30.069]  She goes, well, Jones's lawyers admit he's fake.
[01:25:30.069 --> 01:25:33.152]  And then she never shows where they said it.
[01:25:33.152 --> 01:25:37.275]  Or Roger Stone admits he published fake news and infowars.
[01:25:37.275 --> 01:25:38.196]  None of that's even true.
[01:25:40.831 --> 01:25:50.997]  What Roger Stone got sued, separately from me, by a man named Kwok, who Stone had said
[01:25:53.462 --> 01:25:54.383]  It was in thousands of publications.
[01:26:17.827 --> 01:26:19.589]  Meanwhile, that was separate from InfoWars.
[01:26:19.589 --> 01:26:21.831]  That wasn't even InfoWars statements.
[01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:22.792]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:26:22.792 --> 01:26:23.633]  It's that headline.
[01:26:23.633 --> 01:26:26.036]  InfoWars admits they're fake.
[01:26:26.036 --> 01:26:27.638]  Did she call me for comment?
[01:26:27.638 --> 01:26:28.178]  No.
[01:26:28.178 --> 01:26:29.199]  Did she have me on the show?
[01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:29.339]  No.
[01:26:29.339 --> 01:26:32.683]  In fact, I've been challenging her for a week to come on the show.
[01:26:32.683 --> 01:26:33.864]  Because the young turds
[01:26:34.955 --> 01:26:39.937]  Or exposed as Qatar dictatorship operatives and Hillary Clinton butt boys.
[01:26:39.937 --> 01:26:54.121]  Because of that, they've hired all these little internet people like her that could have been big on their own, that even six months ago were saying it's wrong to censor Alex Jones, but now she works for Sink Uyghur.
[01:26:54.121 --> 01:26:57.182]  And he knows how to run an operation.
[01:26:57.182 --> 01:26:59.723]  And so now when we come back from break, I'm going to play the clip.
[01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:04.206]  Which is not about me, it's about lies.
[01:27:04.206 --> 01:27:08.628]  Where she says, Jones admits they publish fake news.
[01:27:08.628 --> 01:27:21.977]  You know what really happened, now like two and a half years ago was, my ex-wife, God love her, I have the kids full time, mainstream media says I don't, that's again, part of their deception.
[01:27:21.977 --> 01:27:23.118]  They get up on the news,
[01:27:24.397 --> 01:27:26.799]  And they say, Jones says he's an actor.
[01:27:26.799 --> 01:27:27.500]  Where's the clip?
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.221]  Where's the transcript?
[01:27:28.221 --> 01:27:29.422]  Oh, they don't show that.
[01:27:29.422 --> 01:27:41.353]  My lawyer, Randall Wilhite, whose name's on the family law code, UT professor, best family law guy in Texas, they're trying to introduce 10-year-old video of me dressed up in Joker white paint.
[01:27:42.577 --> 01:27:44.459]  Saying, drink your fluoride, kids.
[01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:45.340]  Get sterile.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:46.121]  It's good.
[01:27:46.121 --> 01:27:50.266]  It's telling kids fluoride's bad and showing Harvard Studies.
[01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:52.749]  I'm not actually saying fluoride's good.
[01:27:52.749 --> 01:27:56.373]  Anybody can tell that maybe 2% of the time I do satire.
[01:27:59.406 --> 01:28:11.492]  And then they run with it, and my lawyer gets up and he goes, this is unadmissible, Mr. Jones, just like when Jack Nicholson plays the Joker in Batman, Mr. Jones is being an actor to illustrate satire.
[01:28:11.492 --> 01:28:16.755]  That turns into, Jones admits everything he says is fake.
[01:28:16.755 --> 01:28:17.875]  Now who's the fake news?
[01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:18.756]  It's corporate media.
[01:28:18.756 --> 01:28:28.921]  So here she is, posing as the super liberal, trendy, super sexy, awesome, saying that, and then she goes further, after I'm banned from YouTube so I can't respond.
[01:28:31.559 --> 01:28:37.345]  And says that Roger Stone admits it's all fake.
[01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:47.336]  But she doesn't show you any text or any articles because the real fake person is the Young Turks and their minions.
[01:28:47.336 --> 01:28:51.200]  The Young Turks killed over a million and a half Christians.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.642]  The head of the Young Turks denies it.
[01:28:52.642 --> 01:28:53.363]  Of course he does.
[01:28:57.188 --> 01:29:02.349]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:29:02.349 --> 01:29:04.290]  That's the globalist only hope.
[01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:23.495]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:30.017]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[01:29:30.017 --> 01:29:35.679]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:38.159]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[01:29:38.159 --> 01:29:39.300]  Every order gets free shipping.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.201]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding
[01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:51.404]  allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight but to expand.
[01:29:51.404 --> 01:29:53.085]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.085 --> 01:29:54.345]  I salute you all.
[01:29:54.345 --> 01:29:58.667]  Now please take action at mfortworthstore.com.
[01:29:58.667 --> 01:30:04.670]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:07.611]  And that's what I'm talking about at mfortworthstore.com.
[01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:11.713]  With mfortworth select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:12.193]  We're on the top
[01:30:13.246 --> 01:30:22.371]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:30:22.371 --> 01:30:27.734]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:30:27.734 --> 01:30:30.016]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:30:30.016 --> 01:30:33.518]  MFORWARDSTORE.COM on MFORWARDSELECT storable foods.
[01:30:33.518 --> 01:30:34.999]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:30:34.999 --> 01:30:38.981]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:30:38.981 --> 01:30:41.202]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.283]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:30:42.743 --> 01:30:44.726]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:30:44.726 --> 01:30:47.249]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:30:47.249 --> 01:30:52.274]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:30:52.274 --> 01:30:57.661]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWars Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:30:58.342 --> 01:31:03.847]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:31:03.847 --> 01:31:13.615]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:31:13.615 --> 01:31:21.722]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:31:22.688 --> 01:31:30.610]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:33.711]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:31:33.711 --> 01:31:35.211]  It really is amazing.
[01:31:35.211 --> 01:31:41.913]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:44.594]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:31:45.896 --> 01:31:46.317]  I don't know.
[01:32:00.877 --> 01:32:10.286]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[01:32:10.286 --> 01:32:21.256]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:32:21.696 --> 01:32:27.601]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[01:33:01.231 --> 01:33:03.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.218 --> 01:33:28.900]  It's the final Sunday broadcast of 2018.
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:31.282]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:33:31.282 --> 01:33:32.963]  Central.
[01:33:32.963 --> 01:33:33.823]  And at 8 a.m.
[01:33:33.823 --> 01:33:41.809]  Central, Owen Schroeder is going to host the David Night Show, as David Night goes into surgery under the knife.
[01:33:41.809 --> 01:33:44.551]  Right about 8 a.m., so please tune in tomorrow.
[01:33:44.551 --> 01:33:46.452]  What a treasure, man.
[01:33:46.452 --> 01:33:48.234]  Love David, he's such an amazing person.
[01:33:48.234 --> 01:33:50.275]  So smart.
[01:33:50.275 --> 01:33:54.358]  So smart.
[01:33:54.358 --> 01:33:55.639]  Such a good guy, such a treasure.
[01:33:57.921 --> 01:33:59.562]  So that's coming up tomorrow, 8 a.m.
[01:33:59.562 --> 01:34:01.403]  Central.
[01:34:01.403 --> 01:34:11.747]  Okay, you know, I almost don't want to even give this Young Turk, George Soros-funded creature any attention, but she wants it, she needs to get it.
[01:34:11.747 --> 01:34:14.849]  She's a fraud.
[01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:20.531]  And in the spectrum of folks I'm thinking about suing, and I've sued a few, as everybody knows, I have to, for my good name.
[01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:21.512]  She's definitely in the running.
[01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:29.460]  But when they're not getting money from Gulf War dictators, they're picking up every person they can on the internet.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:35.742]  And this young lady puts out constant videos lying about us, but never has us on, never shows a clip.
[01:34:35.742 --> 01:34:38.504]  She'll just show some fake news headline.
[01:34:38.504 --> 01:34:43.546]  Her name is Emma Vigeland.
[01:34:43.546 --> 01:34:47.727]  And she says that, and I'm going to get into the huge news on Kevin Spacey.
[01:34:47.727 --> 01:34:48.208]  She says,
[01:34:49.289 --> 01:34:50.689]  I admit I'm fake.
[01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:51.670]  I'm a fraud.
[01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:53.050]  Roger Stone admits he's a fraud.
[01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:55.270]  That's it.
[01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:56.571]  Game over.
[01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:59.251]  It's like saying she admits she's a child molester.
[01:34:59.251 --> 01:35:01.812]  Or that she kidnaps kids and, you know, cuts their livers out.
[01:35:01.812 --> 01:35:02.652]  She didn't say that.
[01:35:02.652 --> 01:35:03.653]  She didn't do that.
[01:35:03.653 --> 01:35:04.393]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:35:04.393 --> 01:35:09.234]  If I was going to say she was doing that, I would show it.
[01:35:09.234 --> 01:35:10.734]  But see, she's a fraud.
[01:35:10.734 --> 01:35:14.135]  She works for the Armenian Genocide Club.
[01:35:14.135 --> 01:35:16.636]  Now, I mean, that's what Young Turks stand for.
[01:35:16.636 --> 01:35:17.436]  They say it never happened.
[01:35:18.424 --> 01:35:23.306]  These are some, they get Gulf War state dictator money.
[01:35:23.306 --> 01:35:25.366]  That's who they are.
[01:35:25.366 --> 01:35:34.830]  And so she's there saying that I'm this existential fraud, and that I admit I'm a fraud, but not showing it.
[01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:35.050]  Again.
[01:35:36.428 --> 01:35:40.029]  When I dress up like a joker, I'm playing the part, not when I'm on the air.
[01:35:40.029 --> 01:35:41.310]  It's very clear.
[01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:51.033]  When Roger Stone settles a lawsuit over one specific fact that he admits isn't exactly right, how does it become me that admits I'm a fraud and I'm a criminal?
[01:35:51.033 --> 01:36:03.198]  Mainstream news does retractions and corrections every day, but they think you're stupid, so they make this huge event, and this woman sits there and engages in fraud, in my view, against you and your family.
[01:36:04.471 --> 01:36:07.912]  So let's go ahead and go to her Young Turk report.
[01:36:07.912 --> 01:36:08.673]  They sheep-dip it.
[01:36:08.673 --> 01:36:11.514]  They don't tell you they run the show, but they do.
[01:36:11.514 --> 01:36:13.554]  So, here she is.
[01:36:13.554 --> 01:36:14.375]  Go ahead.
[01:36:14.375 --> 01:36:18.616]  We hear a lot of talk of fake news from the president and from his followers.
[01:36:18.616 --> 01:36:20.697]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:22.038]  You are fake news.
[01:36:22.038 --> 01:36:25.119]  And the fake news refused to call it, right?
[01:36:25.119 --> 01:36:28.700]  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:29.620]  It's fake.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.181]  Phony.
[01:36:30.181 --> 01:36:31.201]  Fake.
[01:36:31.201 --> 01:36:32.662]  Fake news.
[01:36:32.662 --> 01:36:33.842]  We solve a lot of problems.
[01:36:34.002 --> 01:36:36.764]  But what blows my mind is that it's complete projection.
[01:36:36.764 --> 01:36:38.806]  Right-wing news is the fakest of them all.
[01:36:38.806 --> 01:36:44.030]  Studies have shown that Fox News viewers are consistently the most uninformed about world events.
[01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.370]  Hit pause again.
[01:36:44.370 --> 01:36:45.551]  Studies, hit pause.
[01:36:45.551 --> 01:36:47.212]  Studies have shown.
[01:36:47.212 --> 01:36:50.575]  She's just reading some George Soros deal.
[01:36:50.575 --> 01:36:52.256]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:36:52.256 --> 01:36:57.561]  But she's just sharing all this.
[01:36:57.561 --> 01:37:01.444]  This is Mrs. Anti-Free Speech on the Young Turds Network.
[01:37:01.444 --> 01:37:02.805]  So let's go back to Turd Gobbler.
[01:37:02.805 --> 01:37:03.045]  Go ahead.
[01:37:03.599 --> 01:37:09.362]  ...is literally being brainwashed to the point that researchers have dubbed the results the Fox News Effect.
[01:37:09.362 --> 01:37:20.308]  You know what I actually don't care what the New York Post says, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, because they're all fake.
[01:37:20.308 --> 01:37:22.990]  The only channel I watch is Fox and it's on 24-7.
[01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:26.192]  I even have my dogs watching Fox!
[01:37:27.132 --> 01:37:34.837]  But while Fox News is the propaganda arm of the Republican Party and is incredibly effective in its reach, it's mostly targeted towards old people.
[01:37:34.837 --> 01:37:38.039]  I mean, the median Fox viewer is 65 years old.
[01:37:38.039 --> 01:37:48.006]  Young conservatives are gravitating towards news that's even faker, believe it or not, in the sense that it's unfeathered, unrestrained, and unshackled to any and all journalistic standards.
[01:37:48.006 --> 01:37:52.589]  And no propaganda source is more notorious in its lies than Alex Jones' InfoWars.
[01:37:58.638 --> 01:38:04.621]  What does that mean?
[01:38:04.621 --> 01:38:18.428]  So that proves... Seems funny, but Alex Jones' InfoWars has spread mass disinformation incredibly effectively and has actually gotten people to buy in, even having Donald Trump, the President of the United States, on their program.
[01:38:18.428 --> 01:38:24.251]  InfoWars has spread that the government controls the weather, that Bill Gates is trying to commit genocide on minorities...
[01:38:26.147 --> 01:38:28.409]  They admit giant weather modification programs.
[01:38:28.409 --> 01:38:29.369]  It's all over the news.
[01:38:29.369 --> 01:38:32.712]  Bill Gates says we should reduce the human population to zero growth.
[01:38:32.712 --> 01:38:34.113]  On a damn TED Talk, lady!
[01:38:34.113 --> 01:38:36.594]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating about this.
[01:38:36.594 --> 01:38:41.998]  Continue.
[01:38:41.998 --> 01:38:43.839]  Yeah, they even pulled up Bill Gates instantly.
[01:38:43.839 --> 01:38:44.580]  Can we play her?
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:44.840]  Go ahead.
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:54.226]  ...was running a child sex ring out of a pizza parlor... Show me where I say it's the child sex ring in the parlor.
[01:38:54.226 --> 01:38:59.049]  I was covering AP Reuters about the UN and child sex rings, but back it up.
[01:38:59.049 --> 01:39:01.131]  We're gonna play it in a minute.
[01:39:01.131 --> 01:39:02.612]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[01:39:02.612 --> 01:39:05.974]  Again, she doesn't show you anything.
[01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:08.656]  She keeps saying what I've said.
[01:39:08.656 --> 01:39:11.918]  Is Jeffrey Epstein running airplanes with kidnapped kids?
[01:39:11.918 --> 01:39:12.159]  Yes.
[01:39:13.666 --> 01:39:17.348]  Did the AP report on giant child kidnapping rings in Haiti by the UN?
[01:39:17.348 --> 01:39:19.310]  Yes.
[01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:22.111]  Was Hillary's main job out of college representing pedophiles?
[01:39:22.111 --> 01:39:23.532]  Yes.
[01:39:23.532 --> 01:39:27.395]  Is it in the WikiLeaks, even as Podesta admits, about kids in hot tubs with them?
[01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:28.195]  Yes.
[01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:39.743]  And that's all she's got is a sick rear-guard apologist, a new face, because nobody listens to Cenk Uygur, and she's just there to say, but chilling, nothing we really said, just lying to you.
[01:39:41.383 --> 01:39:44.785]  That's an accomplice to all the evil, ladies and gentlemen, right there on screen.
[01:39:44.785 --> 01:39:45.146]  Continue.
[01:40:05.598 --> 01:40:11.420]  We covered the fact that poor people, whether they be black, white, or Hispanic, part of a U.N.
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:14.041]  eugenics program had syphilis tested on them.
[01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.402]  That's declassified, lady!
[01:40:15.402 --> 01:40:23.885]  I know you went to college, you're a trendy and everything, and the government's God, but the government did give hundreds of thousands of syphilis, you dumb tart!
[01:40:23.885 --> 01:40:25.906]  Call it a skiing experiment, you dumb idiot!
[01:40:25.906 --> 01:40:28.387]  That's only one facet of it!
[01:40:28.387 --> 01:40:30.028]  God Almighty, you make me sick!
[01:40:30.028 --> 01:40:30.568]  Go back to her!
[01:40:31.089 --> 01:40:32.150]  Alright, hit pause again.
[01:40:32.150 --> 01:40:33.130]  There's another headline.
[01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:35.912]  The general internet did not buy Anomalies.
[01:40:35.912 --> 01:40:37.774]  Years into it, I said I thought it happened.
[01:40:37.774 --> 01:40:44.078]  But she just keeps re-upping it because they think, well, if we say he's against children, that'll make us look good.
[01:40:44.078 --> 01:40:44.478]  Continue.
[01:40:56.072 --> 01:40:59.596]  Those parents have had to change their addresses because of harassment.
[01:40:59.596 --> 01:41:15.694]  But after all of that, after all of the earth that InfoWars has scorched, now that there's lawsuits and fear of their precious money being taken away, Roger Stone, top Republican strategist who worked with InfoWars and also worked for Donald Trump, has admitted that InfoWars lies.
[01:41:16.295 --> 01:41:17.036]  Knowingly.
[01:41:17.036 --> 01:41:29.588]  Former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone settled a defamation suit seeking $100 million in damages on Monday for publishing false and misleading statements on Infowars.com, a far-right website known for promoting conspiracy theories.
[01:41:29.588 --> 01:41:30.690]  Hit pause.
[01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:31.691]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:33.132]  You don't see even quotes around that.
[01:41:33.132 --> 01:41:34.714]  Those are just words they took out.
[01:41:34.714 --> 01:41:35.675]  None of that was even said.
[01:41:36.527 --> 01:41:37.728]  I mean, this is real fraud.
[01:41:37.728 --> 01:41:38.768]  Continue.
[01:41:38.768 --> 01:41:42.310]  Yeah, that $100 million figure probably changed his tune.
[01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:47.533]  And this isn't the first time an InfoWars operative has admitted it's all an act due to legal troubles.
[01:41:47.533 --> 01:41:53.136]  Alex Jones' lawyer said he was just playing a character in his custody battle with his ex-wife.
[01:41:53.136 --> 01:41:54.877]  So who's the fake news now?
[01:41:54.877 --> 01:41:58.639]  Roger Stone has admitted in court that he is a liar.
[01:41:58.639 --> 01:42:02.441]  And Alex Jones has admitted in court that he's an actor playing a liar.
[01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:02.782]  No, I didn't.
[01:42:02.782 --> 01:42:03.062]  Pardon?
[01:42:03.422 --> 01:42:06.463]  It won't matter to Trump supporters or InfoWars fans.
[01:42:06.463 --> 01:42:06.743]  Why?
[01:42:06.743 --> 01:42:12.945]  Because these Republican propaganda artists have been so effective in muddying the waters that no one knows what is truth anymore.
[01:42:12.945 --> 01:42:22.167]  And ironically, the same people who scream facts over feelings to those who possess empathy are the same ones who follow proven, admitted liars.
[01:42:22.167 --> 01:42:22.827]  Why?
[01:42:22.827 --> 01:42:24.428]  Because it makes them feel good.
[01:42:24.428 --> 01:42:25.388]  Facts over feelings.
[01:42:26.155 --> 01:42:28.917]  Well, somebody's in love with the young turd leader.
[01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:32.460]  God Almighty, is she ready to sell out the system?
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:34.762]  You got a job with George Soros, sweetheart.
[01:42:34.762 --> 01:42:39.586]  You might want to actually show some video or audio clips, dumbass, because we're on TV and radio.
[01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:40.407]  It's all right here.
[01:42:40.407 --> 01:42:41.748]  Ha ha!
[01:42:41.748 --> 01:42:47.312]  But you're funded by a guy that said the best time of his life was rounding up Jews and blowing their heads off.
[01:42:47.312 --> 01:42:49.714]  George Soros on 60 Minutes.
[01:42:49.714 --> 01:42:51.616]  Wow, you're on the wrong side of history, lady.
[01:42:51.616 --> 01:42:52.857]  What a piece of crap.
[01:42:52.857 --> 01:42:55.579]  Let's come back to one of the top pedophiles of the Clinton operation.

[01:45:01.436 --> 01:45:03.218]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:03.218 --> 01:45:15.269]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:15.269 --> 01:45:20.294]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:45:20.754 --> 01:45:21.174]  Let's do it!
[01:45:38.104 --> 01:45:39.845]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:39.845 --> 01:45:49.832]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:49.832 --> 01:45:52.474]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:52.474 --> 01:45:57.177]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:45:57.737 --> 01:46:02.902]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:46:02.902 --> 01:46:04.864]  That's the globalist only hope.
[01:46:04.864 --> 01:46:24.061]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[01:46:24.321 --> 01:46:30.563]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.

[01:46:44.327 --> 01:46:46.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:09.349 --> 01:47:14.310]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:36.456]  Last night in the desert, I came dancing to my beat.
[01:47:39.633 --> 01:47:40.785]  Yeah.
[01:47:53.723 --> 01:48:07.991]  So, in the last week or so, it's come out that Kevin Spacey released a YouTube video saying, you really miss me, you want me back, and that he was making threats to the establishment saying, do you want to really go here?
[01:48:07.991 --> 01:48:09.131]  And I've been really busy.
[01:48:09.131 --> 01:48:18.997]  I know that Kevin Spacey, Dr. McCamm shot police for TV viewers, had flown on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile plane with Bill Clinton many, many times.
[01:48:20.569 --> 01:48:29.678]  And I knew that he was a high-level globalist who'd hung out with the Queen of England and Prince Charles, and man, you don't get in their club unless you're a pedophile.
[01:48:29.678 --> 01:48:30.879]  Just like the Pope.
[01:48:30.879 --> 01:48:31.961]  This is a vampiric group.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.583]  If you're a radio listener, we're showing mainstream news headlines about the pedophilia.
[01:48:37.583 --> 01:48:41.185]  So, I think Kevin Spacey is a fricking dirtbag.
[01:48:41.185 --> 01:48:50.651]  But Robert Mueller, on record, protected Jeffrey Epstein for a decade as an informant for the Clinton-run FBI setting men up with underage girls.
[01:48:50.651 --> 01:48:51.971]  That's mainstream news.
[01:48:51.971 --> 01:48:55.934]  If you're a radio listener, you've got Bureau of Investigation documents on stream.
[01:48:57.602 --> 01:49:02.945]  When I exposed this to media, he goes, Jones says Mueller is a child molester and blah blah blah.
[01:49:02.945 --> 01:49:06.246]  No, I'm saying he covers up for him.
[01:49:06.246 --> 01:49:10.208]  So again, if you're a TV viewer, you can see all this.
[01:49:10.208 --> 01:49:13.130]  But you've got the five minute
[01:49:14.468 --> 01:49:17.649]  Kevin Spacey video coming out after Nantucket.
[01:49:17.649 --> 01:49:23.110]  He gropes on, reportedly, some 23-year-old who really was 18 years old.
[01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:30.271]  But the issue here is, this is how they're using blackmail to control people.
[01:49:30.271 --> 01:49:36.773]  And a good boil down to this is from Question Everything, a YouTube channel, Kevin Spacey's threatening the elitist.
[01:49:37.253 --> 01:49:41.196]  And I went and looked where he says, you know, I'm coming after you if you keep doing this.
[01:49:41.196 --> 01:49:45.018]  He drinks a cup the Queen of England gave him saying she was pledged to him.
[01:49:45.018 --> 01:49:48.901]  And he's been involved, I know, with the royals who are obsessed with pedophilia.
[01:49:50.552 --> 01:49:53.253]  So, and there's a whole background on that.
[01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:55.314]  I mean, it is, it is confirmed.
[01:49:55.314 --> 01:49:56.554]  That's how they control people.
[01:49:56.554 --> 01:50:00.356]  So this nightmare situation goes from bad to worse.
[01:50:00.356 --> 01:50:07.378]  So let's play a little bit of his creepy statement last week, and then let's go to part of this report from Question Everything.
[01:50:07.378 --> 01:50:08.479]  Here it is.
[01:50:08.479 --> 01:50:13.661]  And besides, I know what you want.
[01:50:13.661 --> 01:50:14.101]  You want me
[01:50:15.959 --> 01:50:21.742]  Of course, some believed everything and have just been waiting with bated breath to hear me confess it all.
[01:50:21.742 --> 01:50:28.025]  They're just dying to have me declare that everything said is true and that I got what I deserved.
[01:50:28.025 --> 01:50:29.786]  Wouldn't that be easy?
[01:50:29.786 --> 01:50:32.347]  If it was all so simple?
[01:50:32.347 --> 01:50:37.169]  Only you and I both know it's never that simple, not in politics and not in life.
[01:50:37.169 --> 01:50:39.550]  But you wouldn't believe the worst without evidence, would you?
[01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:44.753]  You wouldn't rush to judgments without facts, would you?
[01:50:44.753 --> 01:50:45.073]  Did you?
[01:50:47.116 --> 01:50:48.756]  No, not you.
[01:50:48.756 --> 01:50:49.397]  You're smarter.
[01:51:11.283 --> 01:51:12.223]  From Question Everything.
[01:51:12.223 --> 01:51:14.104]  We're going to play part of it right now.
[01:51:14.104 --> 01:51:15.224]  It really illustrates this.
[01:51:15.224 --> 01:51:17.264]  Listen, he's on planes with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:51:17.264 --> 01:51:18.725]  He's on planes with Bill Clinton.
[01:51:18.725 --> 01:51:37.489]  He's involved with Jerry, I mean, not just Epstein, but all the other big people that are in the news that have been caught raping women, molesting women, attacking women, and others.
[01:51:37.489 --> 01:51:38.589]  So let's go ahead and go to this report.
[01:51:38.589 --> 01:51:38.909]  Here it is.
[01:51:40.583 --> 01:51:42.003]  A lot.
[01:51:42.003 --> 01:51:45.244]  Now, most of the insinuations are difficult to follow.
[01:51:45.244 --> 01:51:50.866]  However, once I saw the cup he was holding, it all kicked into place.
[01:51:50.866 --> 01:52:00.209]  The cup has the royal crest on it and states, throughout all my life and with all my heart, I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.
[01:52:00.209 --> 01:52:02.290]  Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.
[01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:09.172]  Follow me down this rabbit hole because I think it will leave you satisfied.
[01:52:09.172 --> 01:52:16.075]  And I believe that I will prove that this video was anything but a desperate plea to get his job back.
[01:52:16.075 --> 01:52:24.698]  Take a look at the flight log from Jeffrey Epstein's plane, the disgusting pedophile plane dubbed the Lolia Express.
[01:52:24.698 --> 01:52:28.260]  You will see that Kevin Spacey flew with Bill Clinton on four occasions.
[01:52:31.465 --> 01:52:42.711]  And then again, you've got Harvey Weinstein on the same aircraft flights to these pedophile islands, and you've got Kevin Spacey hanging out with Prince Charles and the Queen of England, all of them.
[01:52:42.711 --> 01:52:58.500]  When the Queen of England's son, not Prince Charles, but the other one, is on the airplane with Andrew, Prince Andrew is on the airplane with Kevin Spacey and Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein.
[01:52:59.795 --> 01:53:03.477]  I mean, these are a bunch of psychotic jerks.
[01:53:03.477 --> 01:53:06.759]  And then he's begging for help on television.
[01:53:06.759 --> 01:53:08.940]  He's saying, help me.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.440]  Here's my cup you gave me.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.181]  You love me.
[01:53:12.181 --> 01:53:14.682]  Your son is on the plane with me.
[01:53:14.682 --> 01:53:18.064]  Bill Clinton's on the plane with me.
[01:53:18.064 --> 01:53:19.845]  Harvey Weinstein's on.
[01:53:19.845 --> 01:53:21.326]  Why are you doing this?
[01:53:25.441 --> 01:53:30.282]  And if you're a radio listener, we're putting mainstream news articles on screen showing all this.
[01:53:30.282 --> 01:53:34.363]  I wouldn't say this if it wasn't already in the news.
[01:53:34.363 --> 01:53:38.923]  But I will connect the dots.
[01:53:38.923 --> 01:53:42.844]  And now Steve Bannon repeatedly meets Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:53:42.844 --> 01:53:47.105]  I learned Stephen Bannon's main mission is to take down Infowars.
[01:53:47.105 --> 01:53:49.825]  Around the clock, he's been tasked by the Clintons to take us down.
[01:53:49.825 --> 01:53:50.125]  Why?
[01:53:50.125 --> 01:53:51.905]  Because we will cover this.
[01:53:51.905 --> 01:53:53.586]  This isn't somebody boasting here.
[01:53:53.586 --> 01:53:54.746]  You've seen how we're under attack.
[01:53:56.565 --> 01:54:00.287]  No one dare stand up for the children.
[01:54:00.287 --> 01:54:02.668]  No one.
[01:54:02.668 --> 01:54:07.791]  And, you know, I'm not looking for a fight, but you know what?
[01:54:07.791 --> 01:54:10.152]  I am on the side of the children.
[01:54:10.152 --> 01:54:21.758]  And so, I'll do whatever I have to do, but if you're a radio listener, you're missing out the video feeds, which are at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:54:21.758 --> 01:54:23.979]  And I'm not trying to take radio listeners away from
[01:54:24.827 --> 01:54:25.828]  The radio stations.
[01:54:25.828 --> 01:54:27.049]  I'm trying to survive here.
[01:54:27.049 --> 01:54:32.172]  I'm trying to tell people if you're a listener, I'm not just saying this.
[01:54:32.172 --> 01:54:41.038]  They misrepresent who we are and what we say and what we stand for because they hate our guts.
[01:54:41.038 --> 01:54:43.059]  And it's only the listeners.
[01:54:43.059 --> 01:54:49.383]  It's only the viewers who can get around the Facebook and the YouTube and the Google sensors.
[01:54:49.383 --> 01:54:52.345]  All these compromised pedophiles they put in charge of those companies.
[01:54:52.345 --> 01:54:52.866]  Oh my God.
[01:54:54.022 --> 01:54:59.364]  Only you can, by word of mouth, say, go to newswars.com, go to infowars.com.
[01:54:59.364 --> 01:55:03.706]  Only you can say, go to that local radio station, go to that local TV station.
[01:55:03.706 --> 01:55:04.566]  Only you can do it.
[01:55:04.566 --> 01:55:06.727]  I'm not worried about me.
[01:55:06.727 --> 01:55:11.929]  I'm worried I'm not strong enough to carry the ball down the field to beat these people.
[01:55:11.929 --> 01:55:18.152]  But if you ever really realize the power you've got, and you really take action, it's over.
[01:55:18.152 --> 01:55:21.173]  I mean, you've done that to a great extent, and that's why they hate Infowars.
[01:55:22.639 --> 01:55:26.782]  Because we're dialed in to awake, involved people.
[01:55:26.782 --> 01:55:32.325]  I have no desire to be on board some aircraft screwing 10-year-old girls or boys.
[01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:36.788]  In fact, I'd kill not to do it.
[01:55:36.788 --> 01:55:46.214]  But when you look at the weird, soft, demonic faces all satisfied of Kevin Spacey and Bill Clinton,
[01:55:49.281 --> 01:55:53.325]  famously represented pedophiles when she got out of college.
[01:55:53.325 --> 01:55:59.390]  And you just realize, oh my God, we found the bottom of the barrel.
[01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:03.894]  We found the most soulless people the planet's ever seen.
[01:56:03.894 --> 01:56:11.081]  And I don't fear what they'll do to me.
[01:56:11.081 --> 01:56:13.483]  I fear if I don't fight them hard enough,
[01:56:15.117 --> 01:56:20.138]  I might be seen by God as being with them.
[01:56:20.138 --> 01:56:36.101]  You see, I fear not absolutely doing everything I can to wreak havoc against their operations and be as strong as I can to defeat them.
[01:56:36.101 --> 01:56:41.583]  And that's the answer to this question.
[01:56:41.583 --> 01:56:42.703]  Because in the universe,
[01:56:44.278 --> 01:56:51.941]  God doesn't even care about outcomes as much as God cares about decisions.
[01:56:51.941 --> 01:56:59.504]  And everyone must make the decision to stand against these vampires that feed on the very souls of children.
[01:56:59.504 --> 01:57:02.945]  Now, this broadcast is going to end in 45 seconds.
[01:57:02.945 --> 01:57:08.907]  And then it's going to go to counterthink with a special hour production by Mike Adams that everyone should see.
[01:57:08.907 --> 01:57:11.648]  And then, Lord willing, David not will be alive tomorrow.
[01:57:11.648 --> 01:57:11.968]  He's having
[01:57:14.957 --> 01:57:26.682]  Whatever you do, realize that in time and space, your action and your will and your spreading the word is unstoppable.
[01:57:26.682 --> 01:57:32.664]  You're like the wind in the sails of humanity's spirit, humanity's destiny.
[01:57:32.664 --> 01:57:35.745]  And that's where we are right now.
[01:57:35.745 --> 01:57:38.446]  Everything else is a joke.
[01:57:38.446 --> 01:57:40.307]  All that matters is the test we now face.
[01:57:40.307 --> 01:57:41.508]  I want to thank the crew.
[01:57:41.508 --> 01:57:42.908]  I want to thank the viewers.
[01:57:42.908 --> 01:57:44.609]  This transmission is now over.
[01:57:48.809 --> 01:57:54.471]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:57:54.471 --> 01:57:57.592]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:57:57.592 --> 01:58:00.253]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:58:00.253 --> 01:58:04.554]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:58:04.554 --> 01:58:11.917]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:58:11.917 --> 01:58:14.478]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:58:17.913 --> 01:58:20.114]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:58:20.114 --> 01:58:20.834]  They called it U.N.
[01:58:20.834 --> 01:58:22.335]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[01:58:22.335 --> 01:58:23.155]  2030 Agenda.
[01:58:23.155 --> 01:58:35.059]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:58:35.059 --> 01:58:36.640]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.801]  Never miss your show, any day.
[01:58:39.801 --> 01:58:41.401]  I mean, what?

[01:58:48.484 --> 01:58:53.325]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
