[00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:21.882]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.625]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.502]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:57.129]  We're broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, 29th day of May 2018 global transmission.
[00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:11.620]  Our own Harrison Smith, intrepid reporter, investigative journalist, is on the ground with one of their team member in the UK and he's going to be covering the continuing unfolding developments with the firestorm that is
[00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:17.328]  The secret arrest and secret imprisonment of Tommy Robinson.
[00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:31.437]  We are also going to have Godfrey Bloom, former member of the EU Parliament from the UK and a big patriot, joining us in the next hour to break down all the other political prisoners in the UK and in Europe.
[00:01:31.437 --> 00:01:32.238]  Gert Wilders.
[00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:54.389]  The Dutch leading politician close to winning the prime ministership there, he has gone and filed a formal complaint and says this is Sharia law and the tyranny of the Islamic takeover because in parliamentary systems it only takes 5, 10, 15 percent depending on the country to then leverage out and win every single election because you'll have up to 10, 15 major parties
[00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.733]  If the Islamists vote almost to a man and woman, they can then be the key tipping for every area.
[00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:04.496]  And that's why Sharia law is already going into effect in areas of London.
[00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:06.318]  There are no-go zones all over Europe.
[00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:09.000]  Just a few years ago, mainstream media denied this.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.341]  Now they admit it, and now they accept it.
[00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:12.322]  It is incredible.
[00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:16.725]  But Tommy Robinson has captured the world's attention.
[00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:22.570]  Even Roseanne Barr tweeted out over the weekend that, oh look, you expose the pedophile rings, you get sent to prison in one hour.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.124]  Folks go, oh, he's in contempt of court in a previous sentence for also covering the grooming gangs that he first exposed.
[00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:34.645]  So that is the reality of what we're dealing with here.
[00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:37.826]  So we're going to have Harrison Smith popping in.
[00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:38.727]  We're going to have
[00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.808]  Godfrey Bloom popping in.
[00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:57.985]  We're going to have members of Tommy Robinson's crew like Kalen Robertson, who really is not just his right-hand man, but the guy that's helped take Tommy to the next level with the support he needed with infrastructure and camera work and gentrification, to use Kalen's term.
[00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:00.989]  He's going to be popping in to give us updates on the latest.
[00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.170]  I'll just tell you this very, very soon.
[00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.085]  Peace of information.
[00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.010]  Not today, tomorrow, but he's coming on today.
[00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.654]  Regardless, I'll leave it at that.
[00:03:09.654 --> 00:03:12.020]  Our people are on the ground with him in the UK.
[00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:16.987]  And then in studio again, he is one of the top First Amendment lawyers.
[00:03:16.987 --> 00:03:18.648]  Talk about what's happening here, but also in Europe.
[00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:21.510]  Mark Randazza is going to be in studio.
[00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.493]  We also have Mr. Nixon here, another lawyer.
[00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:26.613]  We'll see if we can get him on board.
[00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:29.115]  We'll work on some things behind the scenes.
[00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:31.077]  It's all coming up today.
[00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.558]  You definitely want to spread the word about this broadcast.
[00:03:33.558 --> 00:03:36.180]  Now, separately, you've got the fact that the media
[00:03:37.581 --> 00:03:40.343]  Has been trying to spin things massively.
[00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:44.205]  That, oh, Trump backed out of the summit and now it's back on.
[00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:45.746]  Oh, he's schizophrenic.
[00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:46.727]  Oh, he's helter-skelter.
[00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.508]  No, that's how the art of the deal works.
[00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:50.009]  It's how negotiations work.
[00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:57.114]  Like you're about to buy a car and they've agreed to sell it to you for $30,000 and suddenly, oh, you forgot about an add-on cost.
[00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:58.675]  It's had more on the car than we thought.
[00:03:58.675 --> 00:03:59.535]  The car's $35,000.
[00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:00.376]  You say, oh, I'm walking.
[00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:05.253]  And they go, oh, you know what?
[00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:06.594]  We're going to take that off for you.
[00:04:06.594 --> 00:04:07.294]  You're right.
[00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:07.714]  It's a deal.
[00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.455]  A deal's a deal.
[00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:08.635]  $30,000.
[00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:13.538]  So that's what happened.
[00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:14.919]  And here's Trump's latest tweet.
[00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:31.810]  Sorry, I've got to start focusing on energy, on North Korea, nuclear, bad trade deals, VA choice, the economy, rebuilding the military, and so much more, and not on the rigged Russia witch hunt that should be investigating Clinton, Russia, FBI, Justice Obama, Comey,
[00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:34.386]  Lynch, etc.
[00:04:34.386 --> 00:04:35.586]  Absolutely.
[00:04:35.586 --> 00:04:40.930]  Sorry, folks, because the media is challenging him to respond to all the latest Russiagate piddle.
[00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.293]  And he's saying, sorry, I'm going to continue turbocharging the country and was about to go over the edge.
[00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:46.293]  So all that's coming up.
[00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:54.839]  And we've got Schumer tells the media that Spygate doesn't exist and don't report on it, even though we've got Clapper and Brennan, all of them admitting that they were spying on Trump.
[00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.620]  These people are incredible.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.161]  We'll be back.
[00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:57.561]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:02.930]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:14.913]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:52.116]  We have Kalyn Robertson and others who are members of Tommy Robinson's team joining us with exclusive information on the secret police arrest of an amazing journalist that has shocked the world.
[00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:53.437]  That's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:06:53.437 --> 00:07:02.221]  We're also going to be joined by Godfrey Bloom, a veteran military historian, former member of the EU Parliament, also a very famous and successful
[00:07:02.941 --> 00:07:05.123]  He's a brokerage house operator.
[00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:08.227]  He's a real phenomenon, helped engineer the Brexit.
[00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:16.375]  He wants to explain what's really behind Tommy Robinson and other secret police activities that are explosive in the UK.
[00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:17.757]  He's going to dish out information.
[00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:21.679]  Never before heard.
[00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:27.881]  And again, we're also looking at Nigel Farage for the next few days as our crew is there in the UK.
[00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:37.584]  Italy is about to explode because they're telling the Italians that they're under EU control and that their borders will be opened whether they like it or not.
[00:07:37.584 --> 00:07:40.404]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:07:40.404 --> 00:07:44.926]  And we have incredible developments with Schumer telling the media how to report on Spygate.
[00:07:45.686 --> 00:07:53.349]  This guy, just like Hillary, has his fingers in the mainstream media, in late night comics, you name it, telling them what to say and what to do.
[00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:54.529]  Memo to the press.
[00:07:54.529 --> 00:08:02.932]  When you quote the President saying, spygate, it is only fair to immediately follow that by noting there is absolutely no evidence of spying being inserted into his campaign.
[00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:09.694]  It seems to me, failure to do so is a disservice to your readers, viewers in the country.
[00:08:09.694 --> 00:08:13.576]  Now that real message is, I'll call your corporate bosses and have your ass fired.
[00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.690]  If you don't toe the line.
[00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.551]  That's what Schumer does.
[00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:26.412]  He and his aides, hours a day, call up threatening people to get them in line.
[00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:33.754]  Word is Jimmy Fallon wasn't enough anti-Trump and a special phone call was made by Herr Schumer.
[00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:36.834]  Fallon talked about how much trouble he got in from executives.
[00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:37.914]  So that's the incredible bullying.
[00:08:37.914 --> 00:08:41.315]  Meanwhile we have Clapper, Brennan, all of them on video admitting
[00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:43.630]  That Trump was being spied on.
[00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.872]  But they say, oh, we don't like that type of word.
[00:08:47.872 --> 00:08:49.033]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:54.997]  Also, Roseanne Barr, oh my gosh, goes on wild and racist, even though it's not.
[00:08:54.997 --> 00:09:02.161]  Tweetstorm about Clinton's George Soros and Chris Solilzo.
[00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:02.682]  And you read it.
[00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:10.202]  You know, Barr is such the big red-hot thing right now, and she was on the show a few times years ago because she said she was a listener.
[00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:11.844]  And you can tell she's a listener.
[00:09:11.844 --> 00:09:14.387]  And she talks to my producer all the time and says, oh, keep up the great work.
[00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.488]  I'll come on soon.
[00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:16.909]  But never does.
[00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:18.611]  I wonder if she's scared to come on as well.
[00:09:18.611 --> 00:09:23.216]  Because everybody's got to be afraid of the trailblazer and the tip of the spear.
[00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.333]  Our job is not to be popular with the establishment.
[00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.435]  Our job is to hit the barbed wire.
[00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:35.519]  Our job is to cover uncomfortable, scary things so there can be a larger debate about it.
[00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.321]  You can see why the enemy wants to take us down.
[00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:46.468]  They know we're willing to break the facade, to blow through the enemy fortress walls, and to open them up to larger attacks.
[00:09:46.468 --> 00:09:48.350]  That's our job.
[00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.031]  And our listeners
[00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.060]  Understand that.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:58.686]  That's why they've had more than 50 articles I saw just last week trying to figure out how they can shut down InfoWars.
[00:09:58.686 --> 00:10:08.473]  And the group suing me for the Newtown families, the entire lawsuit is a misrepresentation of what I said, what I did, statute of limitations, all that applies.
[00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:12.476]  But they're the group that sued Remington, lost, and are on appeal.
[00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:14.541]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:18.503]  That and other lawsuits caused Remington to announce bankruptcy.
[00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:19.984]  I'm on a search engine that.
[00:10:19.984 --> 00:10:22.585]  So that's the type of enemies we're up against.
[00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:32.750]  We've also, ladies and gentlemen, discovered something very interesting that is going to be breaking later in the broadcast.
[00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:40.093]  And that deals with this whole Starbucks initiative and something very, very interesting and very, very newsworthy concerning it.
[00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:49.331]  That is, quite frankly, devastating information.
[00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:50.351]  We're not gonna go to it yet.
[00:10:50.351 --> 00:11:04.782]  We're gonna put a special report out by the end of the broadcast today that shows you exactly what's going on with this social engineering that's designed to cause division and chips on the shoulders and social problems in the country.
[00:11:04.782 --> 00:11:07.223]  Oh, look at drugsreport.com.
[00:11:10.913 --> 00:11:13.553]  Look at DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:15.614]  Fears over 5G tech.
[00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:18.894]  Cancer from cell towers.
[00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:21.375]  New York CBS.
[00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:22.075]  That just broke.
[00:11:22.075 --> 00:11:23.735]  Will you guys print me these and get me these reports?
[00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:24.395]  Thank you.
[00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:28.156]  Boy, who covered the 3G, the 4G a decade ago?
[00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:29.516]  Who had scientists on?
[00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.537]  Who read all the studies on air?
[00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:37.638]  And there's even an article out in The Independent attacking me for talking about cell phone towers hurting you today.
[00:11:40.026 --> 00:11:44.289]  5G wireless service is coming and so are health concerns over the towers that support it.
[00:11:44.289 --> 00:11:52.317]  Well, they're not... They're not... They're not health concerns.
[00:11:52.317 --> 00:12:03.087]  They're absolute fact that they just did a study last year with rats and 5G massively increased heart tumors and brain tumors.
[00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:10.436]  I sure don't want me one of them brain tumors.
[00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:11.637]  Do you?
[00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:13.078]  But see, that's why they hate us.
[00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:17.022]  And I keep going back to this because they think we're all a bunch of nations of cowards.
[00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:23.508]  They think they're going to roll out this giant depopulation program.
[00:12:23.508 --> 00:12:26.711]  They think we're all stupid and we'll just adapt to dying.
[00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.032]  Well, I say we don't do that.
[00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:33.809]  We stand up to Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Google.
[00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:37.229]  Of course they censor you when you send out an Infowars.com link.
[00:12:37.229 --> 00:12:39.210]  Of course they try to block you when you try to send out our videos.
[00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.850]  That's why you've got to share them by hand.
[00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.871]  That's why you've got to hand them out to people.
[00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:45.231]  It's why you've got to download them and give people on disk.
[00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:52.673]  That's why you've got to have viewing parties and say, this is the broadcast, this is the show, this is what the system fears.
[00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:56.554]  This is what they're trying to stop, just like Tommy Robinson.
[00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.072]  He got threatened out of the UK not to work with Tommy.
[00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:04.094]  Not to fund Tommy.
[00:13:04.094 --> 00:13:05.575]  To desert Tommy.
[00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:09.058]  Tommy had a $400 used camera.
[00:13:09.058 --> 00:13:10.819]  So we bought him expensive cameras and gave him $20,000.
[00:13:10.819 --> 00:13:12.741]  It's not a lot.
[00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:14.062]  It's as much as we could do.
[00:13:14.062 --> 00:13:17.344]  But it's because I knew he was doing so much good.
[00:13:17.344 --> 00:13:18.845]  No strings attached.
[00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:24.289]  Just go out there and expose what's happening.
[00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:25.710]  What's the old saying?
[00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.791]  We're not sure who said it.
[00:13:30.572 --> 00:13:39.762]  When tyranny prevails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cry to appease appease are hung by those they tried to please.
[00:13:39.762 --> 00:13:45.849]  Once you let tyranny go over into this tipping point, once you go over into that point, everything collapses.
[00:13:45.849 --> 00:13:52.035]  You go into a Venezuela, a North Korea, a Communist China overnight, and you get all the yes-men and women who have no honor.
[00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.431]  who line up to go along with it.
[00:13:54.431 --> 00:14:08.597]  But now, the headline, Zero Hedge, up on Infowars.com, we have it posted, Britain's Rage Over Robinson Arrest As Mass Protests Breakout Worldwide, and all over the country.
[00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.559]  You walk up on the street, people are talking about Tommy Robinson everywhere.
[00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:21.884]  So, Harrison Smith and Kalen Robinson are going to go out in the next day or so, and just do live feeds, seeing how angry and upset people are.
[00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:30.703]  It's all going to be covered here at InfoWars and the live streams, the local radio stations, the local TV stations you're listening to and watching.
[00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:37.187]  And we'll look at the worldwide protest, country by country, when we return on the other side.
[00:14:37.187 --> 00:14:42.229]  But remember, we have a Memorial Day week specials throughout this week.
[00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:47.552]  I can say that these are, some of these are even better specials than we had during Christmas.
[00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:50.634]  We had some wider specials, hundreds of items on sale.
[00:14:50.634 --> 00:14:52.395]  We've got more than 15 on sale right now.
[00:14:54.261 --> 00:15:00.544]  But on the storable food, super high quality, 50% off, that is basically a loss later.

[00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:20.735]  It is better than top selling formulas that cost $60.

[00:17:47.637 --> 00:17:51.077]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[00:20:22.968 --> 00:20:35.572]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:35.572 --> 00:20:47.456]  So, we have the Pope's right-hand man in a secret trial in Australia where the court clerk was fired for even reading the charges privately.
[00:20:49.079 --> 00:21:04.277]  You have secret courts now in England with massive numbers of Muslims being tried and convicted for running giant child kidnapping and sexual exploitation rings.
[00:21:04.277 --> 00:21:07.821]  And you have Tommy Robinson who first exposed it 11 years ago.
[00:21:11.308 --> 00:21:34.816]  Being tortured in prison for a year in general population, getting out a few years ago, going out and just covering that a trial was happening, being put in jail for that, now going and simply pointing out that there is a trial, which you could even do under England's draconian law, and being given 13 months in jail, within one hour, revoking his suspended sentence.
[00:21:36.344 --> 00:21:39.227]  And demonstrations breaking out all over the world.
[00:21:39.227 --> 00:21:43.833]  This is the type of thing that catches people's attention.
[00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:48.538]  Crowds climbing Saturday over 10 Downing Street's gates, thousands in the streets.
[00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:53.764]  The media would show close video shots or close photos where you wouldn't see the crowd, but we showed the crowd.
[00:21:55.623 --> 00:21:58.645]  Where it showed that it was thousands and thousands.
[00:21:58.645 --> 00:22:02.247]  We've got some shots from up on top of a building and it's amazing.
[00:22:02.247 --> 00:22:03.967]  Headline from ZeroHedge.com.
[00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:07.129]  We have the full article posted at Infowars.com as well.
[00:22:07.129 --> 00:22:13.433]  Britain's rage over Robinson arrest as mass protests break out worldwide.
[00:22:13.433 --> 00:22:16.814]  In Europe, in the US, in Australia.
[00:22:16.814 --> 00:22:21.597]  They're happening everywhere.
[00:22:21.597 --> 00:22:24.839]  And we've got the police all over the world
[00:22:25.922 --> 00:22:32.188]  Trying to dial this back, but it's not working, and the more they try to suppress it, the bigger the pushback gets.
[00:22:32.188 --> 00:22:42.357]  There's been at least six demonstrations have been held across Australia, in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Cambria, Brisbane, and other areas.
[00:22:42.357 --> 00:22:48.963]  Mass protests broke out all over England, not just in London, on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.
[00:22:50.503 --> 00:22:55.144]  Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner whose life is in clear and pressing danger.
[00:22:55.144 --> 00:23:02.426]  German Member of Parliament Peter Beistran said Saturday in a statement.
[00:23:02.426 --> 00:23:08.428]  Dutch Prime Minister Gert Wilders showed up at the British Embassy in The Hague to deliver his comments.
[00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:09.528]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[00:23:10.436 --> 00:23:11.996]  I'm here on behalf of millions.
[00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:15.657]  Freedom of speech is being violated all over Europe and also in Berlin.
[00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:16.878]  Let's talk freedom of speech.
[00:23:16.878 --> 00:23:23.379]  Kurt Wilders, Dutch PM, who's the leader to be their next president.
[00:23:23.379 --> 00:23:30.641]  Wilders penned a letter to the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs over the weekend with five questions about Robertson's situation.
[00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:38.443]  And we've got also people like Godfrey Bloom joining us in the next hour.
[00:23:39.591 --> 00:23:46.714]  Coming out and saying it's an absolute tyranny, but there are many other political prisoners he's going to expose the situation, their fate coming up.
[00:23:46.714 --> 00:23:53.978]  Similar statements coming out, of course, Nigel Farage, who we're looking for an interview in the next few days with him directly in the UK.
[00:23:53.978 --> 00:24:09.065]  It is all coming up as we see Europe and Australia and America and the UK awaken to just how authoritarian the political correctness movement is and how it's globally directed by the open
[00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:18.088]  Foundation groups who talk about how they want open society, but it's actually the opposite.
[00:24:18.088 --> 00:24:26.074]  So we'll be breaking that down with Kalen Robertson, the right-hand man of Tommy Robinson, you could say his manager.
[00:24:26.074 --> 00:24:29.037]  And then we're also going to have Godfrey Bloom coming on.
[00:24:29.037 --> 00:24:30.978]  So that is in the second hour.
[00:24:30.978 --> 00:24:33.721]  You do not want to miss that information.
[00:24:33.721 --> 00:24:36.303]  We have Tommy's first message from prison.
[00:24:37.608 --> 00:24:45.752]  Posted up on InfoWars.com via Kalen Robertson, who was extremely eloquent when he joined me Sunday.
[00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:47.994]  That guy's on fire, just like Tommy.
[00:24:47.994 --> 00:24:52.296]  And then we've also, again, are going to have the latest from Tommy.
[00:24:52.296 --> 00:24:53.657]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:24:53.657 --> 00:24:58.039]  But you may be hearing his voice here on air very, very soon.
[00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:03.962]  But I'm not going to count our chickens until they've hatched.
[00:25:03.962 --> 00:25:06.844]  Not going to count a fish until it's in the boat on the ice.
[00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:12.063]  So, pray for Tommy, support him.
[00:25:12.063 --> 00:25:14.847]  He is in a safer wing of the prison.
[00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:21.574]  They put him in a bigger prison, so he's not in general population with the Islamists, who make up about half the prison population in London.
[00:25:21.574 --> 00:25:23.156]  They're let off, by the way, with slaps on the wrist.
[00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:35.014]  Because they're being used as a criminal underground of sex trade, you name it, that they operate in their own countries to be operated inside the UK for the British ruling criminal pedophile class.
[00:25:35.014 --> 00:25:37.436]  That is all coming down.
[00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:46.603]  Now speaking of Gert Wilders, they've tried to kill him, they've tried to put him in prison for simply saying that Islam is a threat to Europe's future freedom.
[00:25:46.603 --> 00:25:49.285]  They've also indicted for a second time the
[00:25:50.946 --> 00:26:01.209]  Leading nationalist Le Pen, Marie Le Pen, and again, Marie Le Pen has pointed out to Trump and others, stop trying to pacify the left.
[00:26:01.209 --> 00:26:02.270]  Stop trying to work with them.
[00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.490]  They will never work with you.
[00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.930]  They want to conquer everyone.
[00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.131]  They're not going to stop.
[00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:07.211]  They're going for broke.
[00:26:07.211 --> 00:26:08.932]  It's time to be hardcore.
[00:26:08.932 --> 00:26:09.912]  It's what the people want.
[00:26:09.912 --> 00:26:12.873]  And Trump's been hardcore overall.
[00:26:12.873 --> 00:26:18.114]  And we see him come out and be nice to the left, so they then show their hand and ask for everything.
[00:26:18.114 --> 00:26:20.075]  But for our listeners, that message is true.
[00:26:21.252 --> 00:26:25.355]  All of us have to understand, we're not trying to win a popularity contest at mainstream media.
[00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:27.677]  We're here to take them on.
[00:26:27.677 --> 00:26:30.539]  Just like Hitler talked bad about America during World War II.
[00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:32.220]  The globalists are going to say horrible things about us.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.301]  They're going to attack us.
[00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:34.061]  They're going to lie about us.
[00:26:34.061 --> 00:26:35.222]  They're going to sue us.
[00:26:35.222 --> 00:26:36.523]  They're going to twist things.
[00:26:36.523 --> 00:26:44.089]  Because we're taking the country back from them and destroying their authoritarianism and they don't like it.
[00:26:44.089 --> 00:26:47.231]  Now, let's go ahead and go to this statement from in front of the
[00:26:49.144 --> 00:26:52.188]  Worldwide Embassy of England at The Hague.
[00:26:52.188 --> 00:26:55.131]  Here it is.
[00:26:55.131 --> 00:26:57.414]  British Embassy in The Hague.
[00:26:57.414 --> 00:27:00.878]  And I'm here because I'm shocked and outraged.
[00:27:00.878 --> 00:27:05.603]  What happened in the United Kingdom last week is an absolute disgrace.
[00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:12.477]  Tommy Robertson, a freedom fighter and Islam critic, was jailed.
[00:27:12.477 --> 00:27:17.861]  While the judge issued a gag order to silence the media.
[00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:23.706]  Freedom of speech is being violated all over Europe and also in Britain.
[00:27:24.733 --> 00:27:28.477]  The lights of freedom are going out.
[00:27:28.477 --> 00:27:35.464]  Islam critics are taken to court, jailed, or targeted with fatwas.
[00:27:35.464 --> 00:27:38.127]  And the authorities try to silence us.
[00:27:38.127 --> 00:27:45.975]  However, Islamists are pampered, protected, defended, and that is totally unacceptable.
[00:27:46.816 --> 00:27:49.378]  We will not accept this.
[00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:50.198]  Never.
[00:27:50.198 --> 00:27:59.865]  We will continue speaking the truth about Islam and horrendous crimes like rape, genital mutilation, honor killings and terrorism.
[00:27:59.865 --> 00:28:06.049]  For we protect our own people, whatever the price may be.
[00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:10.752]  And that is why I stand here in solidarity with Tommy Robinson.
[00:28:11.897 --> 00:28:17.039]  Britain used to be a bastion of freedom of speech.
[00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:24.081]  Today, its authorities are behaving like North Korea and Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:29.383]  I'm here on behalf of millions in the Netherlands, in Europe,
[00:28:30.043 --> 00:28:32.185]  And also in Britain.
[00:28:32.185 --> 00:28:37.208]  And in their name, I say we will no longer be silent.
[00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:39.770]  Our future is at stake.
[00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.131]  And we will protect it.
[00:28:42.131 --> 00:28:44.313]  Free Tommy Robinson.
[00:28:44.313 --> 00:28:46.154]  Release him from jail.
[00:28:46.154 --> 00:28:46.935]  Today.
[00:28:46.935 --> 00:28:49.036]  Restore freedom of speech.
[00:28:49.036 --> 00:28:51.898]  And stop gagging the people.
[00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:53.279]  That's Gert Wilders.
[00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:54.020]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.483]  The Info War straight ahead with our reporter on the ground in London where there's a reporting gag.
[00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:02.848]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[00:29:02.848 --> 00:29:05.690]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.591]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:12.654]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[00:29:12.654 --> 00:29:15.936]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[00:29:15.936 --> 00:29:22.200]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[00:30:14.358 --> 00:30:19.702]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:05.861]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:06.421]  Thanks for holding.
[00:31:06.421 --> 00:31:07.842]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:31:07.842 --> 00:31:11.463]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:31:11.463 --> 00:31:20.207]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:31:20.327 --> 00:31:36.495]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:45.579]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:50.482]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:31:50.482 --> 00:31:55.724]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.

[00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.551]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:22.005]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:57.311]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com, EuropeWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, you name it.
[00:33:57.311 --> 00:34:03.112]  And there's a lot of URLs that get blocked on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, get shadow banned.
[00:34:03.112 --> 00:34:11.474]  That's why we have new sites like NewsWars.com that aren't as banned and aren't as blocked, so you can get those key stories out to warn people of what's happening.
[00:34:11.474 --> 00:34:12.194]  This just in,
[00:34:13.689 --> 00:34:25.479]  European Union approves Bayer 62.5 billion takeover of GMO and pesticide giant, the good old folks at Monsanto.
[00:34:25.479 --> 00:34:32.945]  So that's two evil giants getting in bed together to make a horrific monster baby.
[00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:35.707]  Remember Bayer?
[00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:36.708]  The German company?
[00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:41.430]  That worked, of course, with Hitler in World War II, but oh, that was World War II.
[00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.671]  I'm sure they didn't mean it.
[00:34:42.671 --> 00:35:01.324]  That's why they got caught in the 90s for over a decade working with Bill Clinton, I should add, because nobody else would take blood and then not test it and still certify it as good, creating Factor VIII and other blood products that gave estimated one million people
[00:35:02.318 --> 00:35:10.422]  Hepatitis A, B, or C, or HIV, and horrible death sentences.
[00:35:10.422 --> 00:35:16.625]  But that's okay, California's legalized giving somebody HIV, so even though it can still kill some people, that's okay.
[00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:18.666]  That's a liberal gift.
[00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:31.652]  So, you got Monsanto famously dumping dioxin in the black neighborhoods, and famously giving us Agent Orange, and famously giving us all this GMO that in every study kills the rats and causes them, you know, to have huge tumors by the second generation.
[00:35:33.977 --> 00:35:35.838]  But that's okay.
[00:35:35.838 --> 00:35:42.941]  EU approves Bayer's 62 plus billion dollar takeover of GMO and pesticide giant Monsanto.
[00:35:42.941 --> 00:36:01.791]  But you know, Monsanto famously, gotta cue this up on short notice, their top lobbyists would go all over the news for decades and would say over and over and over and over again that you could drink
[00:36:02.677 --> 00:36:07.978]  Roundup, Glyphosate, it's his brand name, and that wouldn't hurt you.
[00:36:07.978 --> 00:36:17.220]  But then when he was confronted with the fact that Indian farmers were committing suicide by drinking and he said, oh, I'm not going to drink it, are you crazy?
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.500]  First he says, of course I'll drink it.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.061]  They go, oh, I have a glass right here.
[00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:20.621]  Are you crazy?
[00:36:20.621 --> 00:36:22.221]  I'm not going to drink that.
[00:36:22.221 --> 00:36:28.182]  That's how dumb they think you are with 5G and the Glyphosate.
[00:36:28.182 --> 00:36:31.043]  You know, Brazil had basically no breast cancer 20 years ago.
[00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:40.833]  Isn't that just incredible?
[00:36:40.833 --> 00:36:47.319]  Now, think about that.
[00:36:47.319 --> 00:36:50.722]  Brazil had no breast cancer to speak of.
[00:36:50.722 --> 00:36:52.103]  Very, very rare.
[00:36:52.103 --> 00:36:57.147]  But a few years after they adopted Roundup, they're now just as high as the United States.
[00:36:57.147 --> 00:36:59.409]  Look it up!
[00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:02.292]  It's amazing how these people operate.
[00:37:03.812 --> 00:37:06.795]  EU approves Bayer.
[00:37:06.795 --> 00:37:12.019]  62.5 billion takeover GMO pesticide giant Monsanto.
[00:37:12.019 --> 00:37:13.080]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.743]  Isn't that just darling?
[00:37:16.743 --> 00:37:29.714]  And you can just take their basic genetically stacked corn and things like that and by the second generation you have destruction of the DNA in the rats.
[00:37:31.468 --> 00:37:32.348]  And massive tumors.
[00:37:32.348 --> 00:37:46.735]  By third generation, you have near complete sterility, but the few rats that are born, or guinea pigs, tend to, for some reason, with that particular corn, grow the testicles on top of their heads.
[00:37:46.735 --> 00:37:48.476]  And hair grows out of their mouths.
[00:37:48.476 --> 00:37:51.137]  There's photos of this.
[00:37:51.137 --> 00:37:58.180]  And then the liberals always take that and make jokes about it, like, oh, the frogs are sterile and they're gay, and oh, the rats have their testicles on top of their heads.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.061]  It's funny!
[00:38:02.093 --> 00:38:02.773]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:38:02.773 --> 00:38:05.794]  Long-running GMO study finds tumors in rats.
[00:38:05.794 --> 00:38:06.474]  That's one from 2013.
[00:38:06.474 --> 00:38:09.295]  They had studies before that.
[00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:10.935]  There's hundreds of these studies.
[00:38:10.935 --> 00:38:15.176]  And then by the third generation, you can find the photos with the testicles on the head.
[00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:16.657]  That's just what happens.
[00:38:16.657 --> 00:38:23.978]  And the hair growing out of the mouth.
[00:38:23.978 --> 00:38:29.660]  Now, when we come back from break, we're going to talk to our own Harrison Smith, who's on the ground in London, England.
[00:38:30.845 --> 00:38:32.506]  And he's been out on the streets filing reports.
[00:38:32.506 --> 00:38:34.447]  He's got a lot of people to talk to.
[00:38:34.447 --> 00:38:42.673]  There's a supposed reporting ban there right now, even admitting that there's Muslim grooming gangs, or on where Tommy Robinson is.
[00:38:42.673 --> 00:38:45.535]  I'd say that attempt to ban it has failed.
[00:38:45.535 --> 00:38:52.120]  Suddenly we're seeing British newspapers reporting on it, though with a hateful tone towards Tommy and anyone else that supports him.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.263]  But you could say they're losing this PR battle big time.
[00:38:56.991 --> 00:39:01.552]  And there's demonstrations all over Australia, all over Europe, demonstrations in the U.S.
[00:39:01.552 --> 00:39:02.332]  It's amazing.
[00:39:02.332 --> 00:39:07.053]  We've got the Zero Hedge article, ZeroHedge.com, article on Infowars.com right now.
[00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:16.975]  It is critical to get that information out as fast as possible to keep this thing rolling.
[00:39:16.975 --> 00:39:24.656]  And the longer he's in prison, the more that the state is protecting Islamists will become evident.
[00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:28.162]  You can make a film about this whole subject.
[00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:38.550]  It's on record that returning ISIS and Al Qaeda members for many years are given the best housing, the best free cars, the best welfare.
[00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:49.677]  While pensioners, 75, 80 year olds, retirees, that's what they call them over there as pensioners, retirees are having their gas allotments taken that we're talking are 300, 400 pounds a winter.
[00:39:52.165 --> 00:39:52.345]  I don't
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.481]  Hundreds of millions of pounds that came out in the news for her palaces.
[00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:17.262]  She got her gas allotment.
[00:40:17.262 --> 00:40:22.684]  The Queen gets taxpayers to pay for her gas allotment, so it's all snug as a bug in a rug.
[00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:38.849]  But old people, they don't get anything in the UK, because they're just old dirty Brits that need to roll over and die and make room for guys in nightgowns, 80 plus percent that don't work, that are on welfare, who have a side job trafficking your daughter.
[00:40:39.733 --> 00:40:46.296]  And if you give them any problems, the CPS comes and takes your kids from you and gives them to Muslim families.
[00:40:46.296 --> 00:40:47.837]  That's on record!
[00:40:47.837 --> 00:40:49.638]  Because you'll put up with it.
[00:40:49.638 --> 00:40:52.659]  Thomas Jefferson was once asked, what is the limit of tyranny man can live under?
[00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:56.341]  And he said, the limit is that which you will accept.
[00:40:56.341 --> 00:40:58.482]  True words have never been stated.
[00:40:58.482 --> 00:41:07.286]  He also said, we will not be transported towards liberty on a feathered bed.
[00:41:11.852 --> 00:41:15.875]  We're gonna come back and actually show you some of the wide shot videos where you just see thousands of people demonstrating.
[00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:16.736]  It's amazing.
[00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:23.701]  Now, before we go any further, if you don't support this broadcast, The Globalist will be successful in shutting us down and blocking us.
[00:41:23.701 --> 00:41:26.823]  But right now, we're getting a lot of new TV affiliates and radio affiliates.
[00:41:26.823 --> 00:41:29.666]  We are reaching out, expanding more websites, more live shows.

[00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:56.202]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:45:00.185 --> 00:45:10.768]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.768 --> 00:45:12.848]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.848 --> 00:45:15.709]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.709 --> 00:45:17.190]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:24.011]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the inflow org.
[00:45:24.011 --> 00:45:25.272]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:45:26.092 --> 00:45:35.799]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:52.631]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:55.773]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:45:55.913 --> 00:46:00.035]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:00.035 --> 00:46:07.659]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:46:07.659 --> 00:46:15.582]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:46:15.582 --> 00:46:18.664]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:46:19.304 --> 00:46:23.949]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:28.093]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:46:28.093 --> 00:46:31.236]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:46:31.236 --> 00:46:36.001]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:39.004]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:46:39.444 --> 00:46:54.271]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:46:54.271 --> 00:46:56.072]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:46:56.072 --> 00:47:03.336]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:47:03.336 --> 00:47:05.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.548 --> 00:47:39.586]  Imagine if I told you, as I did, a decade ago, that in the future, governments would be opening their borders and bringing in tens of millions of Islamicists and allowing them to rape
[00:47:40.618 --> 00:47:43.541]  Little girls, children, to have people in massive sex trade.
[00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:56.015]  You'd have Islamic mayors over London that the head of the border patrol and the home office and the paramilitary police, the federal police in the UK would be an Islamicist, not even born in the country.
[00:47:56.829 --> 00:48:11.494]  And that they would be absolutely engaged in a reign of total control, and that activists that exposed massive child kidnapping rings, confirmed, convicted, would then be in jail for talking about it on the streets of London, Tommy Robinson.
[00:48:12.054 --> 00:48:20.858]  Well, we've got a raft of interviews with Tommy Robinson's crew coming up today with the latest developments, with Nigel Farage, with Godfrey Bloom on the scene.
[00:48:20.858 --> 00:48:26.061]  So we're going to have HD interviews from England coming out also on the show via Skype.
[00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:28.762]  We've got so much because this is that big trigger point.
[00:48:28.762 --> 00:48:32.944]  This is the big awakening happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:32.944 --> 00:48:34.045]  This is historic.
[00:48:34.685 --> 00:48:39.872]  And Infowars.com and Newswars.com, just as we're at the tip of the spear getting Trump elected.
[00:48:39.872 --> 00:48:43.337]  Tip of the spear exposing fluoride, giving you brain cancer and bone cancer.
[00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:44.559]  Now Harvard admits it.
[00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:46.682]  Tip of the spear exposing global government.
[00:48:46.682 --> 00:48:48.625]  Tip of the spear exposing everything.
[00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.772]  We are now at the tip of the spear of this fight because of your support, your prayers.
[00:48:53.772 --> 00:48:54.932]  So thank you all.
[00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:57.333]  Please support the local station you're listening to.
[00:48:57.333 --> 00:48:59.334]  Spread the word about the local station.
[00:48:59.334 --> 00:49:00.275]  Become a sponsor.
[00:49:00.275 --> 00:49:01.655]  Support the sponsors.
[00:49:01.655 --> 00:49:04.597]  This is a time to stand boldly against the enemy.
[00:49:04.597 --> 00:49:09.339]  You think the folks at the Texas Revolution were popular in Santa Ana's ranks?
[00:49:09.339 --> 00:49:09.379]  No!
[00:49:10.359 --> 00:49:12.140]  You think I'm popular in the globalist ranks?
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.902]  You think I'm trying to win a popularity contest?
[00:49:14.902 --> 00:49:22.706]  I'm trying to change the world, putting my life on the line, and I'm willing to do it because I know we can win and because I know you're supporting us.
[00:49:22.706 --> 00:49:25.508]  So joining us above Waterloo Station.
[00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:29.290]  is Harrison Smith, our intrepid reporter and crew.
[00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:36.096]  They're going to be out and about doing live feeds today in London and there are more demonstrations, we're told, coming up.
[00:49:36.096 --> 00:49:46.944]  So Harrison, break down what you've witnessed, the historic developments that are unfolding and your take being inside England right now, for all intents and purposes, is a police state.
[00:49:46.944 --> 00:49:51.068]  Under their current law, they could jail you for what you're about to say, even though
[00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:52.809]  That's a false interpretation.
[00:49:52.809 --> 00:49:53.950]  The law is corrupt.
[00:49:53.950 --> 00:50:00.614]  They selectively let other media outlets report it, but other media outlets in the UK are given denotices and told they can't report.
[00:50:00.614 --> 00:50:07.158]  This is outrageous, but then returning ISIS and Al-Qaeda members are given free housing and coddled.
[00:50:07.158 --> 00:50:07.678]  It's incredible.
[00:50:09.153 --> 00:50:09.853]  Yeah, it is.
[00:50:09.853 --> 00:50:15.315]  Well, the good news is that the reporting ban has been lifted as of today, I believe.
[00:50:15.315 --> 00:50:22.217]  So now the story is actually getting out a little bit and hopefully that means that more Brits will be aware of exactly what's going on.
[00:50:22.217 --> 00:50:24.098]  That's going to be the topic of our on the show.
[00:50:24.158 --> 00:50:24.538]  We're good to go.
[00:50:46.238 --> 00:50:51.740]  You know, things like just in front of the escalator, they have these metal bars to stop you from carrying bags on.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.582]  It's like, you know, an amusement park where everything is soft and nothing's too dangerous.
[00:50:56.582 --> 00:51:07.387]  I mean, there's this weird sense of sort of treating everybody like children, and obviously that goes over to... That's the imperial condition, the imperial programming.
[00:51:07.387 --> 00:51:08.247]  That's domestication.
[00:51:09.491 --> 00:51:18.035]  Yeah, and so yesterday we went to the gates at Downing Street at Whitehall, where the protest had gone on from Friday to Sunday.
[00:51:18.035 --> 00:51:21.717]  They had died out by the time we got there, and now you're seeing video of it here.
[00:51:21.717 --> 00:51:23.177]  So we were at that gate.
[00:51:23.177 --> 00:51:28.060]  The police presence was definitely increased, although there was not big crowds of people.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:34.943]  We did, as we were walking down the street, we hear this chant of Tommy Robinson's name, and so we sort of sought that out, and there were
[00:51:35.663 --> 00:51:40.325]  A couple guys standing on the street sort of still protesting and keeping it alive.
[00:51:40.325 --> 00:51:43.107]  But I do have a message from Tommy Robinson.
[00:51:43.107 --> 00:51:45.768]  This is something that he wants everybody to hear.
[00:51:45.768 --> 00:51:53.772]  He had a phone call with his wife and some of his crew earlier today, and his message is that the big protest will be on the 9th.
[00:51:53.772 --> 00:51:55.153]  It'll be June 9th.
[00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:59.515]  And so there will be more details about that coming, but that is the date that is coming up.
[00:51:59.515 --> 00:52:01.316]  That will be the big demonstration.
[00:52:02.037 --> 00:52:04.420]  So that's what I have from Tommy today.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:11.809]  And then tomorrow, if our luck holds out, we will be having an exclusive with Tommy Robinson.
[00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:14.753]  And that just sort of depends on... Let's not get into the details.
[00:52:17.697 --> 00:52:19.618]  Obviously trying to do something there.
[00:52:19.618 --> 00:52:20.198]  But that's great.
[00:52:20.198 --> 00:52:21.439]  Get an interview with his wife.
[00:52:21.439 --> 00:52:22.500]  Get an interview with his crew.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.301]  We've got Talyn Robertson coming on.
[00:52:25.301 --> 00:52:27.722]  His interview Sunday was powerful.
[00:52:27.722 --> 00:52:28.483]  It went viral.
[00:52:28.483 --> 00:52:29.783]  Drudge linked to it.
[00:52:29.783 --> 00:52:31.304]  Millions and millions of views.
[00:52:31.304 --> 00:52:33.165]  And that's with the censorship.
[00:52:33.165 --> 00:52:37.347]  They still couldn't suppress InfoWars because of how powerful his message was.
[00:52:37.347 --> 00:52:40.109]  And he just said everywhere, people are talking about Tommy Robinson.
[00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:41.109]  They're upset.
[00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:43.711]  You know, the denotice to where
[00:52:44.671 --> 00:52:49.815]  They didn't know what was happening, and that the media wouldn't even say that he'd been arrested or put in prison.
[00:52:49.815 --> 00:52:52.657]  I think this has really crossed a line.
[00:52:52.657 --> 00:52:56.380]  I think this is a real point of no return, an event horizon, Harrison.
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.881]  What do you think?
[00:52:57.881 --> 00:53:07.189]  Yeah, it definitely is, and I think the fact that they have now removed that ban that they had placed on it really says that they kind of realized their mistake, because definitely it's...
[00:53:09.821 --> 00:53:14.322]  It got a lot more attention, the fact that they banned talking about it.
[00:53:14.322 --> 00:53:15.823]  It's the typical Streisand effect.
[00:53:15.823 --> 00:53:17.123]  I mean, it happens every time.
[00:53:17.123 --> 00:53:23.685]  It's like they don't learn their lesson, but they ban this and just the awareness of it skyrockets.
[00:53:23.685 --> 00:53:29.187]  And also some good news from Tommy's crew is that the donations are pouring in to help his legal fund.
[00:53:29.187 --> 00:53:37.570]  They have pretty high hopes about the outcome of that and being able to work some magic legally to hopefully
[00:53:38.462 --> 00:53:43.725]  At least get him some protection in jail if not, you know, released early.
[00:53:43.725 --> 00:53:46.367]  Although, you know, they haven't said anything concrete.
[00:53:46.367 --> 00:53:55.572]  They are saying that the donations are coming in rapidly and that they say Americans are really pulling way more than their share of the weight.
[00:53:55.572 --> 00:53:58.534]  And, you know, they just say Americans, you know, anything free speech.
[00:54:00.308 --> 00:54:06.534]  In the free speech realm, Americans just open their hearts and really pour out goodwill.
[00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:14.161]  Well, they also understand that Tommy has been a champion from the beginning, exposing this whole situation.
[00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:19.367]  They also understand that Tommy has gone through hell, lost his business, lost everything.
[00:54:20.814 --> 00:54:24.318]  They understand that he is the archetypal hero.
[00:54:24.318 --> 00:54:25.359]  They know what we've been through.
[00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:27.761]  They know what Trump's been through, his family.
[00:54:27.761 --> 00:54:36.130]  We know as Trump supporters wearing a Make America Great Again hat, or wearing an Infowars.com, or a Hillary for Prison shirt, they know what we go through.
[00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.753]  And they know about the harassment, the PIs, and the lawsuits.
[00:54:42.248 --> 00:54:46.689]  Matt Drudge basically wears a disguise when he's out in public.
[00:54:46.689 --> 00:54:51.690]  Not like a Groucho Marx mask or anything.
[00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.391]  Because that's what this has turned into.
[00:54:53.391 --> 00:54:56.072]  And we're up against a tyranny.
[00:54:56.072 --> 00:54:57.292]  We know we are.
[00:54:57.292 --> 00:55:06.034]  And we know that they're using Islam as their battering ram to bring it in and then make us comply to it when it's not compatible with our culture and our society.
[00:55:06.034 --> 00:55:07.975]  So I'm against bombing the Muslims and invading them.
[00:55:07.975 --> 00:55:09.015]  I was against all those wars.
[00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:12.537]  And now I'm against them coming here and taking us over as well.
[00:55:12.537 --> 00:55:14.999]  And just as they've said, nobody invited these folks.
[00:55:14.999 --> 00:55:16.920]  Nobody said we're going to conform to you.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.621]  We're tired of it.
[00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:19.122]  Go ahead.
[00:55:19.122 --> 00:55:20.963]  Well, yeah, they didn't ask the people here.
[00:55:20.963 --> 00:55:21.704]  That was one thing.
[00:55:21.704 --> 00:55:25.146]  Tommy Robinson has a very powerful speech where he says they never asked us.
[00:55:25.146 --> 00:55:27.988]  They never asked us if we wanted to be subjected to this.
[00:55:27.988 --> 00:55:29.549]  They just enforced it upon us.
[00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:31.291]  That's, you know, it's a top-down control.
[00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:32.031]  It's not democracy.
[00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:33.753]  It's not anything like democracy.
[00:55:33.753 --> 00:55:35.654]  And you know that
[00:55:36.471 --> 00:55:52.144]  Most places can't talk about this, and that's what's so important about InfoWars, and that's what I said for my report yesterday in front of the gate, saying, look, you know, you need institutional power to be able to do stuff like this, to be able to send a reporter, you know, at a split notice from Texas to London to cover this.
[00:55:52.144 --> 00:56:00.351]  And most places that have that institutional power, they're under the control of the greater institutions, right?
[00:56:00.351 --> 00:56:00.731]  That's right.
[00:56:00.831 --> 00:56:17.648]  We don't have any institutions, and if you read the original Clinton Foundation documents from their law library, not the new foundation, but their presidential law library, the first thing they said in 1993 is, we cannot allow conservative, Christian, or American-style institutions.
[00:56:17.648 --> 00:56:21.412]  We must stop the Western Journalism Center and Joseph Farah.
[00:56:22.324 --> 00:56:37.959]  So, they said we can't let them sell books, we can't let them make money, we've got to call them conspiracy theorists, and we've got to ridicule them selling anything, because if they kickstart an economy, people are hungry for it, and it'll build an ecosystem.
[00:56:38.837 --> 00:56:41.299]  And they call it the vast right-wing conspiracy today.
[00:56:41.299 --> 00:56:55.171]  No, it's the vast, common-sense, Americana, free-market system where we want to be free, and we want to be left alone, and we're not bowing to communism, globalism, socialism, Islam, pedophilism, globalist Vaticanism, any of it.
[00:56:55.171 --> 00:56:58.354]  We are done Hollywoodism, all of it.
[00:56:58.354 --> 00:57:03.679]  We're done with these groups trying to conquer us, Starbucks and all its George Soros brainwashing.
[00:57:04.159 --> 00:57:07.020]  We stand against it, and we're saying no.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.261]  Harrison Smith, great job.
[00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:10.242]  I know you've got a raft of things coming up.
[00:57:10.242 --> 00:57:11.483]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[00:57:11.483 --> 00:57:21.088]  And then, we've got Kalen Robertson, really Tommy Robertson's manager, joining us to talk about the latest developments straight ahead.
[00:57:21.088 --> 00:57:23.369]  Harrison, thank you so much.
[00:57:23.369 --> 00:57:24.349]  Thanks Alex.
[00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:28.651]  And you're doing some live feeds today, so David Knight's hosting the fourth hour.
[00:57:28.651 --> 00:57:31.253]  So if that happens, pop in then or pop in later with us.
[00:57:31.253 --> 00:57:31.813]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:32.898 --> 00:57:33.379]  Sounds good, thanks.

[00:58:56.178 --> 00:58:57.038]  It'd take hours.
[00:58:57.038 --> 00:58:59.480]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.660]  It's stronger.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.281]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:59:02.281 --> 00:59:05.503]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:59:05.503 --> 00:59:06.623]  It's back in stock.
[00:59:06.623 --> 00:59:09.805]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:59:09.805 --> 00:59:13.127]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:59:13.567 --> 00:59:13.667]  Yes.
[00:59:30.228 --> 00:59:32.409]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:01.852 --> 01:00:03.073]  You've found it.
[01:00:03.073 --> 01:00:05.074]  The tip of the spear.
[01:00:05.074 --> 01:00:08.496]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.496 --> 01:00:17.362]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[01:00:17.362 --> 01:00:25.147]  Harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things ought to be.
[01:00:25.147 --> 01:00:30.210]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[01:00:33.314 --> 01:00:39.455]  Old Merle Haggard.
[01:00:39.455 --> 01:00:41.416]  He's got that one line.
[01:00:41.416 --> 01:00:48.877]  Yeah, I hear about some squirrely guy who just don't believe in fighting.
[01:00:48.877 --> 01:00:53.978]  But I wonder.
[01:00:53.978 --> 01:00:57.139]  You know, I'm an anti-war guy when it comes to offense.
[01:00:58.427 --> 01:01:05.791]  And the globalists have put us in all these wars to build their world government at our expense.
[01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:10.294]  But at the same time, that doesn't mean that I hate our military.
[01:01:10.294 --> 01:01:12.195]  And that is what the globalists have done.
[01:01:12.195 --> 01:01:24.061]  They have us carry out these missions, then they use their own publications to demonize the very missions they're making money off of, and then our men and women in uniform are getting their arms and legs blown off for.
[01:01:24.061 --> 01:01:27.103]  Then when they get back, they give them horrible medical care.
[01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:33.693]  We're getting Kalen Robertson on the line via Skype.
[01:01:33.693 --> 01:01:40.157]  He was on fire Sunday night during the broadcast.
[01:01:40.157 --> 01:01:47.841]  Laying out the energy of the country, what's happening now, demonstrations across the country.
[01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:51.723]  Demonstrations across Europe, across Australia, now some here in the US.
[01:01:51.723 --> 01:01:54.505]  But there's a big demonstration coming up.
[01:01:54.505 --> 01:01:54.865]  We talked
[01:01:57.298 --> 01:02:00.039]  To Mr. Robinson's wife, who's very, very private, you know why.
[01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:06.262]  They've got a FADWA out against him.
[01:02:06.262 --> 01:02:07.963]  That's a hit.
[01:02:07.963 --> 01:02:11.765]  A contract.
[01:02:11.765 --> 01:02:17.348]  The Religion of Peace wanting to kill him and his family.
[01:02:17.348 --> 01:02:19.829]  And they were there screaming and yelling, and there's even video of this.
[01:02:21.246 --> 01:02:34.878]  Dragging their fingers across their necks to him saying we're gonna get you and your family when the police arrested him for daring to stand outside a courthouse and point out that they were having Muslim grooming gang trial inside.
[01:02:34.878 --> 01:02:36.439]  Think about that.
[01:02:36.439 --> 01:02:39.402]  Think about how far all this has gone.
[01:02:39.402 --> 01:02:46.008]  TommyRobinsonOnline.com is the website that Kalen Robinson helped set up.
[01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:50.510]  He gave the infrastructure he needed, the camera work, all of it.
[01:02:50.510 --> 01:03:08.617]  People can donate there, and as you heard earlier from Tommy Robinson's wife, through our man in England now, over there, Harrison Smith, that the lion's share of the donations are coming from right here in the United States, and of course from this broadcast.
[01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:14.899]  So we really appreciate the listeners and what they're doing, but remember, as Harrison was saying, we've got to have the institution
[01:03:15.882 --> 01:03:18.384]  The Clintons said, we fear an institution.
[01:03:18.384 --> 01:03:38.681]  The first thing they saw before Drudge even showed up two years later, he already had his email list but he wasn't online, in the classical web with DrudgeReport.com, they say in there, and I keep going back to this little obscure piece of obscurity, Obscura, the Western Journalism Center, this could spread, we need to shut them down.
[01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:43.986]  We can't let them sell books, we gotta ridicule that, we gotta put regulators on them, we gotta stick the IRS on them.
[01:03:46.038 --> 01:03:50.462]  I know Farrer even looked at suing them with the statute of limitations.
[01:03:50.462 --> 01:03:51.303]  It's the same thing today.
[01:03:51.303 --> 01:03:57.168]  They're just working behind the scenes with lawyers and groups to shut us down, to crush us, so they can crush you.
[01:03:57.168 --> 01:04:01.091]  Because we're here pointing out when people are getting censored.
[01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:03.614]  And when we get censored, Drudge points out we're getting censored.
[01:04:03.614 --> 01:04:05.896]  And when Tommy gets censored, we point out he's being censored.
[01:04:05.896 --> 01:04:07.177]  So we're watching each other's backs.
[01:04:09.807 --> 01:04:17.971]  But it wasn't until InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com covered Tommy, that there was even any coverage in this country.
[01:04:17.971 --> 01:04:22.134]  Sky News, others, they just took the reports down when the British government ordered it.
[01:04:22.134 --> 01:04:37.262]  So that's why I keep harping on how important InfoWars is, and how important it is that you go to InfoWarsStore.com while we have free shipping on our best-selling items, and 50% off on more than 15 items like X2, like RainForce Plus, like the real Red Pill,
[01:04:38.396 --> 01:04:41.577]  Plus, now, it's all there.
[01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:48.739]  Plus just means when we, under the whole FDA rules, when you update a brand or a formula, you have to change the name, so we just call it Plus.
[01:04:48.739 --> 01:04:50.319]  It just means better, higher quality.
[01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.200]  Bodies is amazing.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:51.980]  It's all there.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.420]  Infowarshore.com.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.601]  We'll be right back with Kaylin Robertson.
[01:04:58.257 --> 01:05:18.229]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.229 --> 01:05:20.351]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:24.353]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:25.374]  And I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.794 --> 01:05:31.598]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:33.980]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.621]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.621 --> 01:05:37.562]  That's my dad.
[01:05:37.562 --> 01:05:39.423]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.423 --> 01:05:41.905]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:51.091]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.091 --> 01:05:55.554]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:02.317 --> 01:06:08.100]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:15.323]  We are launching our biggest recruitment and hiring operation ever in our 23-year history.
[01:06:15.323 --> 01:06:23.147]  And we prepare to go 24 hours a day live on TV and radio from the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas.
[01:06:23.507 --> 01:06:30.289]  We're looking for video editors, live show producers, people that can run live TV and radio, investigative journalists.
[01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:35.750]  We're looking for reporters out in the field who can stay where you are currently yet.
[01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:45.413]  We're looking to hire around 15 people, maybe even more, as we take the information war to the next level in the face of the globalists.
[01:06:45.413 --> 01:06:45.913]  So please,
[01:06:46.773 --> 01:06:55.636]  Go to InfoWars.com, go to InfoWars.com forward slash contest, and you'll find the links to our major hiring drive.
[01:06:55.636 --> 01:07:04.718]  And we're also launching, as I just alluded to, a major reporter contest with $26,000 in prizes.
[01:07:04.718 --> 01:07:05.619]  First place, $20,000.
[01:07:05.619 --> 01:07:07.059]  Second place, $5,000.
[01:07:07.059 --> 01:07:09.160]  Third place, $1,000.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.641]  But all of you will be winners because the special reports you cut on any topic you wish
[01:07:14.241 --> 01:07:25.846]  We have the rules on InfoWars.com forward slash contest will then be seen on my broadcast will then be heard on the radio and will be posted to our major websites like NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:07:25.846 --> 01:07:35.451]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.
[01:07:35.791 --> 01:07:53.400]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.041]  Now, we're going to be hiring right through into 2019 in this big expansion.
[01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:03.744]  But it's critical that as fast as you can, you get your portfolio, your reel, into us.
[01:08:03.744 --> 01:08:07.745]  Whether it be in radio, whether it be in print, whether it be in film.
[01:08:07.745 --> 01:08:09.985]  Whatever your work is, we want to see it.
[01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.506]  So send it in with your resume.
[01:08:11.506 --> 01:08:14.967]  So this is a very, very exciting chance for InfoWars.
[01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:20.310]  To up our game in the face of the globalists, but for you to also be a part of this operation.
[01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:27.633]  So directly apply to work with us or apply and at the same time get involved in the contest.
[01:08:27.633 --> 01:08:29.234]  It's all up to you.
[01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:32.256]  We are expanding in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[01:08:32.256 --> 01:08:33.677]  We are not victims.
[01:08:33.677 --> 01:08:35.257]  We are victorious.
[01:08:35.257 --> 01:08:40.300]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.662]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color, and creed who love liberty.
[01:08:43.942 --> 01:08:44.262]  I think so.
[01:09:20.011 --> 01:09:28.837]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide on satellite, internet, AM, FM, UHF, VHF, cable.
[01:09:28.837 --> 01:09:30.037]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:09:30.037 --> 01:09:33.800]  This is the Black Sheep Broadcast.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:43.526]  This is the cutting edge, the real tip of the spear, the hated sword in the fight against the globalists.
[01:09:43.526 --> 01:09:44.787]  And proud to be in that position.
[01:09:45.902 --> 01:09:54.784]  But I keep pointing that out because they've got their demonization campaign going against me like I'm a foreign government they're getting ready to invade.
[01:09:54.784 --> 01:10:05.466]  Hundreds of thousands of articles, hundreds of thousands, lying about us in the last few years.
[01:10:05.466 --> 01:10:08.507]  Just last week I looked it up in a full search.
[01:10:08.507 --> 01:10:09.807]  They published in more than 10,000
[01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:19.351]  Newspapers, lies about me and Sandy Hook, and the same group that sued Remington Firearms to bankrupt them.
[01:10:19.351 --> 01:10:21.653]  Same group, out of Connecticut.
[01:10:21.653 --> 01:10:24.756]  They beat the suit, but they're just going out of business.
[01:10:24.756 --> 01:10:27.959]  Oldest firearms company in the nation.
[01:10:27.959 --> 01:10:34.064]  Over 10,000 news articles demonizing us, lying about us, and putting out the lies that are in that suit.
[01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:35.606]  And that didn't count the TV stations.
[01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:37.467]  I did a LexisNexis search.
[01:10:37.467 --> 01:10:37.888]  Guess what?
[01:10:39.574 --> 01:10:42.637]  Over 5,000 TV stations came up doing it as well.
[01:10:42.637 --> 01:10:49.322]  I mean, when I say hundreds of thousands, folks, they are hitting us like Cold War propaganda level.
[01:10:49.322 --> 01:10:54.246]  Because they've said if they can crush Infowars, they're going to do it to everyone.
[01:10:54.246 --> 01:10:56.087]  This is the fight.
[01:10:56.087 --> 01:10:57.388]  Now we're getting Kalen Robertson on.
[01:10:57.388 --> 01:10:59.830]  He's having some trouble with Skype for some reason where he's at.
[01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:05.374]  A heroic gentleman fighting right alongside Tommy Robinson, helping take Tommy to the next level.
[01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:10.453]  And joining us later is Godfrey Bloom, one of the most fiery members of the European Parliament.
[01:11:10.453 --> 01:11:12.935]  He's now out of the Parliament getting into the media fight.
[01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:16.197]  Military historian, veteran, patriot, helped lead the Brexit.
[01:11:16.197 --> 01:11:23.741]  Here's his breakdown on Tommy Robinson and what he had to say about the worldwide demonstrations that are taking place right now.
[01:11:24.534 --> 01:11:30.958]  I've got this Tommy Robinson business and I've never met the fellow and I don't know anything about the case, but that's the point.
[01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:36.601]  It appears he's been sent to prison for 13 months and I don't know anything about the case.
[01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:39.082]  I don't know what the legal implications are.
[01:11:39.082 --> 01:11:40.443]  I don't know what the offence was.
[01:11:40.443 --> 01:11:42.544]  I don't know anything about it at all.
[01:11:42.544 --> 01:11:45.206]  All I know is what I've seen on social media.
[01:11:45.206 --> 01:11:48.908]  And it didn't look to me like he'd done anything wrong, but I don't know.
[01:11:48.908 --> 01:11:50.769]  I don't know.
[01:11:50.769 --> 01:11:51.410]  And neither do you.
[01:11:52.717 --> 01:12:02.662]  So what I'm suggesting is, what is really, really wrong is the judge actually closing down any press comment on this.
[01:12:02.662 --> 01:12:07.785]  So the country doesn't know whether Tommy Robertson deserves to go to prison or not.
[01:12:07.785 --> 01:12:08.345]  We don't know!
[01:12:08.345 --> 01:12:14.768]  How can we make our own judgement on whether justice has been seen to be done?
[01:12:14.768 --> 01:12:17.390]  Or whether natural justice has been done?
[01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:21.891]  And moreover, there is a caveat, is there not?
[01:12:21.891 --> 01:12:28.774]  That we have had one man sent to prison for putting a piece of bacon outside a mosque.
[01:12:28.774 --> 01:12:30.955]  He was given a year's sentence.
[01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:33.456]  It was only about three weeks before he was murdered.
[01:12:33.456 --> 01:12:38.898]  And another one came a little bit after that, and it was only about a week before he was attacked.
[01:12:40.014 --> 01:12:59.835]  Now, what bothers me is, I think we all know, and a lot of my friends in both the police and the prison service tell me, that there are some prisons which are run by the inmates, a significant number of whom are natural enemies of Tommy Robinson, whether indeed he is safe or not.
[01:12:59.835 --> 01:13:01.076]  And I suspect that he isn't.
[01:13:01.997 --> 01:13:08.382]  All these things we don't know, all these things as citizens in a free society, we should be able to make our own judgments on.
[01:13:08.382 --> 01:13:12.905]  But we can't, because they've closed down any press freedom on this.
[01:13:12.905 --> 01:13:15.047]  I'm 68 years old, you know.
[01:13:15.047 --> 01:13:17.268]  I'm just wondering where this country's going.
[01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:19.230]  I'm honestly wondering where this country's going.
[01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:24.754]  Because it seems to me we're going back to sort of the East Germany of the Soviet Union.
[01:13:26.529 --> 01:13:28.931]  No freedom of speech.
[01:13:28.931 --> 01:13:32.853]  No freedom at all for the ordinary citizen to express his views.
[01:13:32.853 --> 01:13:35.714]  Whether they be right, wrong, or indifferent, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:35.714 --> 01:13:42.858]  That's the whole point of free speech, that we can say what we like, when we like, as long as we're not actually hurting anybody else.
[01:13:42.858 --> 01:13:45.979]  In the spirit of John Stuart Mill, for example.
[01:13:45.979 --> 01:13:50.802]  So this Tommy Robinson thing makes me deeply uneasy, and I think it makes us all deeply uneasy.
[01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:54.084]  And I think when we students are losing faith
[01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:58.369]  In the judicial system, it's the thin end of the wedge.
[01:13:58.369 --> 01:14:02.374]  And it's the end of a civilized society as we know it.
[01:14:02.374 --> 01:14:05.859]  I hope I don't go to prison for actually making this observation.
[01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:06.560]  Maybe I will.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:06.860]  Who knows?
[01:14:07.591 --> 01:14:08.051]  That's right.
[01:14:08.051 --> 01:14:10.753]  When he made that a few days ago, there was a reporting ban on it.
[01:14:10.753 --> 01:14:15.236]  When Harrison Smith shot outside Penn Downing Street yesterday, there was a reporting ban.
[01:14:15.236 --> 01:14:23.462]  When our good friend Kalen Robertson joined us, really the right-hand man and the manager of Thomas.
[01:14:23.462 --> 01:14:24.702]  Well, Thomas has been so much more effective.
[01:14:24.702 --> 01:14:26.984]  He's had good support the last year and a half.
[01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:30.106]  I mean, who knows if he'll get arrested for when he came on Sunday.
[01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:35.990]  But I'm told, we're going to break here in a moment, my friend, but I'm told, Kalen, that the reporting ban has now been lifted.
[01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:37.271]  Looks like this blew up in their face.
[01:14:38.572 --> 01:14:39.973]  It just has been lifted.
[01:14:39.973 --> 01:14:50.501]  I believe it was from massive pressure from a couple of local newspapers actually demanded that it was removed, which means it, you know, it wasn't really properly standing in the first place if it was able to be taken away just with that little amount of pressure.
[01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:52.883]  So, um, that's really, really good.
[01:14:52.883 --> 01:14:58.088]  That means I can now reveal to you in the next few minutes exactly what happened in the courtroom, exactly what was said back and forth legally.
[01:14:58.088 --> 01:15:00.289]  And we can go into that a little bit, which is really good.
[01:15:00.289 --> 01:15:02.131]  Yeah, it's very good news.
[01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:02.651]  Wow.
[01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:05.654]  I didn't realize you can now tell folks what really happened in the courtroom.
[01:15:05.654 --> 01:15:07.035]  This is going to be an exclusive then.
[01:15:08.618 --> 01:15:09.679]  Well, I assume I can.
[01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:12.343]  Look, this is what happens when a press ban is lifted.
[01:15:12.343 --> 01:15:15.027]  It means that you can talk about what actually went on in the case.
[01:15:15.027 --> 01:15:17.570]  You can't talk about the case with the grooming scandal.
[01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.172]  That still has a press restriction.
[01:15:19.172 --> 01:15:20.494]  But you can talk about what happened here.
[01:15:20.494 --> 01:15:21.395]  So I have some notes.
[01:15:21.395 --> 01:15:23.558]  Obviously, I didn't bring a pen and paper in the courtroom.
[01:15:24.559 --> 01:15:31.843]  All right, Kaelin Robertson, I am blown away that we're getting the first look at this information.
[01:15:31.843 --> 01:15:39.428]  None of you were even scared to tell me privately over the phone and Skype in the weekend what was happening, though you told me some in confidence, but I didn't repeat it, obviously, because I couldn't.
[01:15:39.428 --> 01:15:52.016]  But now we're going to find out, the public's going to find out, what happened in that courtroom when he was sent away for 13 months for daring to just say that there was a Muslim grooming case going on, period.
[01:15:53.077 --> 01:15:56.323]  The Tommy Robinson Firestorm continues on the other side.

[01:20:20.465 --> 01:20:22.467]  Watch me!
[01:20:22.467 --> 01:20:23.808]  I got it!
[01:20:23.808 --> 01:20:25.349]  Hey!
[01:20:25.349 --> 01:20:27.591]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[01:20:27.591 --> 01:20:29.713]  I got something that does!
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:46.718]  Kaelin Robertson, who is the camera guy, the webmaster, really the manager of Tommy Robinson, who in the last year and a half has helped him really get his message out stronger, is joining us.
[01:20:46.718 --> 01:20:49.562]  He just met with Tommy's wife, who's extremely private.
[01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:53.926]  They've now just lifted the gag order on Tommy's arrest.
[01:20:53.926 --> 01:20:56.667]  Nationwide order that the media not cover it.
[01:20:56.667 --> 01:20:58.589]  Think of how draconian that is.
[01:20:58.589 --> 01:21:00.270]  We've never seen anything like this.
[01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:01.651]  It's totally woken up England.
[01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:03.572]  There's demonstrations all over the world.
[01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:16.521]  This is huge and so he's gonna be able to now give you, this has just got lifted a few minutes ago, the first reportage on what happened at the sentencing for 13 months of Tommy Robinson.
[01:21:16.521 --> 01:21:19.383]  He wrote notes inside of the
[01:21:20.483 --> 01:21:21.123]  Courtroom.
[01:21:21.123 --> 01:21:25.144]  So again, Kalen Robertson, please break it down.
[01:21:25.144 --> 01:21:28.085]  Right, so I only have some of the really significant points in here.
[01:21:28.085 --> 01:21:33.766]  I actually didn't manage to take notes of every single thing that was said in the courtroom, but these are the most significant things.
[01:21:33.766 --> 01:21:43.589]  So the number one most important thing, which actually caused a little bit of a gasp in the room from a couple of the press, was when the judge actually admits that he hadn't watched the full live stream.
[01:21:43.609 --> 01:21:44.369]  We're good to go.
[01:22:05.738 --> 01:22:24.143]  So, I would say that's the most significant thing that happened there in a second, is that it was acknowledged in the courtroom by Tommy's appointed lawyer, not his official lawyer, because we didn't have time to put that into place, but the one that they gave him from the state, that if he goes to jail, it's extremely likely that he won't survive.
[01:22:24.143 --> 01:22:25.383]  He's said he's had six
[01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:27.303]  I think we're good to go.
[01:22:53.248 --> 01:22:55.032]  That's it.
[01:22:55.032 --> 01:22:58.358]  He said that freedom of speech comes with consequences.
[01:22:58.358 --> 01:23:00.862]  That was probably one of the opening statements of what he said.
[01:23:00.862 --> 01:23:05.671]  He repeated it a couple more times, and he acknowledged that Tommy's suspended sentence
[01:23:06.591 --> 01:23:10.712]  Obviously, Tommy was on a suspended sentence from a previous thing last year.
[01:23:10.712 --> 01:23:17.674]  The judge said that he would have done this and given the same sentence to Tommy that he did a few days ago, regardless of that suspended sentence.
[01:23:17.674 --> 01:23:19.354]  He basically said it was irrelevant.
[01:23:19.354 --> 01:23:20.655]  It had nothing to do with it.
[01:23:20.655 --> 01:23:23.295]  So everybody who's saying, oh, well, of course he's being put in jail.
[01:23:23.295 --> 01:23:24.636]  He's on a suspended sentence.
[01:23:24.636 --> 01:23:26.396]  It's actually irrelevant in this case.
[01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:29.396]  The judge didn't really seem to be bothered about it.
[01:23:29.396 --> 01:23:33.400]  So those are the key points that I managed to note down from the room.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.423]  It was such a short trial, there wasn't really much else mentioned.
[01:23:36.423 --> 01:23:39.166]  It was sort of in and out, a bit of a kangaroo court type thing.
[01:23:39.166 --> 01:23:41.308]  So those are the main points.
[01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:44.611]  Kaelin, I am rarely speechless, as everyone knows.
[01:23:44.611 --> 01:23:47.254]  My head is spinning as I look at these notes.
[01:23:49.249 --> 01:23:51.891]  He said, this is the consequence of your free speech.
[01:23:51.891 --> 01:23:55.534]  So a direct attack on the Magna Carta, you name it.
[01:23:55.534 --> 01:24:00.598]  And then said, this has nothing to do with your suspended sentence for covering another trial.
[01:24:00.598 --> 01:24:03.400]  I'm putting you in prison for this.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.643]  And so, wow, how long did he then sentence him?
[01:24:06.643 --> 01:24:08.384]  We've heard 13 months.
[01:24:08.384 --> 01:24:10.266]  This is just, this is just mind blowing.
[01:24:11.283 --> 01:24:13.945]  Yeah, I can confirm it was 13 months.
[01:24:13.945 --> 01:24:22.232]  I know they did say that there's a chance that it could be reduced to, I think, half of that on good behaviour, that's standard practice.
[01:24:22.232 --> 01:24:31.600]  So, you know, if that goes out throughout, you know, if he survives, if you don't catch him as early, it would be around six and a half months on good behaviour, but the actual sentence is 13 months.
[01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:33.867]  And let's be clear.
[01:24:33.867 --> 01:24:36.628]  He was attacked many times when he spent a year in prison.
[01:24:36.628 --> 01:24:38.910]  He was attacked when he was in for a few months last year.
[01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:40.791]  We showed news articles about that.
[01:24:40.791 --> 01:24:42.632]  A man that put a piece of bacon by a mosque.
[01:24:42.632 --> 01:24:45.053]  He was killed within a week of being in jail.
[01:24:45.053 --> 01:24:47.415]  Everybody else that criticizes Islam gets stabbed.
[01:24:48.615 --> 01:24:49.756]  So, there's the headline.
[01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:52.238]  Bacon on mosque offender dies in prison.
[01:24:52.238 --> 01:24:55.880]  The death penalty for putting a piece of bacon by the mosque.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.801]  It actually wasn't even on the mosque.
[01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:59.362]  So, they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:24:59.362 --> 01:25:10.929]  I'm also told that the judge was laughing and enjoying himself when the lawyer for Tommy, the barrister, the solicitor, brought up the fact that it'll be a death sentence if he's in jail.
[01:25:10.929 --> 01:25:11.990]  That the judge just didn't care.
[01:25:13.564 --> 01:25:17.005]  I can't confirm if he was laughing and enjoying himself at the same time when he said that.
[01:25:17.005 --> 01:25:22.226]  I think that was a mix-up of reports of when he was sort of smirking through the window, which was earlier looking down when we were outside.
[01:25:22.226 --> 01:25:28.107]  But he didn't really acknowledge it when the lawyer said that it's very likely he could die in jail.
[01:25:28.107 --> 01:25:30.447]  He's had really serious cracks in his life.
[01:25:30.447 --> 01:25:37.688]  So you're saying the same judge, because this has all been secret until five minutes ago, the same judge is the one that sentenced him?
[01:25:37.688 --> 01:25:40.809]  The one who was in the window that we took a picture of is the same person.
[01:25:43.624 --> 01:25:51.750]  So the judge running the grooming trial is the one that also imprisoned the reporter for standing on the street.
[01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:52.311]  Wow!
[01:25:52.311 --> 01:25:54.733]  Judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.574]  This is mega city!
[01:25:56.574 --> 01:25:57.735]  This is Judge Dredd!
[01:25:59.306 --> 01:26:02.809]  Yeah, well, it's a really, really bizarre situation.
[01:26:02.809 --> 01:26:04.051]  It's a really, really bizarre case.
[01:26:04.051 --> 01:26:09.176]  I don't have full notes into the very, very, very... Let me tell you, you're doing an incredible job, Kalen Robertson.
[01:26:09.176 --> 01:26:16.282]  I'm going to go to break and come back in about three minutes, but talk about, I know she's a very private lady, how Tommy's wife's doing, how the children are doing.
[01:26:16.282 --> 01:26:21.868]  I know there's a photo out, a Muslim hit on them for years, but I mean, how she's taking it, because you met with her today.
[01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:35.294]  Yeah, well obviously I don't want to go into his family's lives too much because they're very private people like you've acknowledged, but they're obviously very upset by it, but they're being very strong that they're dealing with it in the best way possible.
[01:26:35.294 --> 01:26:42.435]  They're just doing the same thing that we're doing right now, which is going down the legal battle, which is getting the best people we can to represent him, which is going down that route.
[01:26:42.435 --> 01:26:46.316]  So yeah, that's what they're doing right now.
[01:26:47.714 --> 01:26:51.697]  And that's why you've got TommyRobinsonOnline.com.
[01:26:51.697 --> 01:26:53.119]  I've talked to you privately, I'll just say it.
[01:26:53.119 --> 01:27:01.065]  There's enough for part of the legal battle, very expensive to get good barristers, good legal counsel in England, even more expensive than the U.S.
[01:27:01.065 --> 01:27:05.289]  We're talking about 10,000 pounds a day or so.
[01:27:05.289 --> 01:27:10.213]  When they're in court, tens of thousands in preparations, and the family obviously needs your support.
[01:27:10.213 --> 01:27:11.454]  So Tommy Robinson Online.
[01:27:12.847 --> 01:27:13.887]  Thank you, Tommy.
[01:27:34.955 --> 01:27:40.377]  They've got Soros-backed groups and Hillary-backed lawyers that are direct lawyers for Hillary suing me all over the place.
[01:27:40.377 --> 01:27:42.758]  As fast as we throw them out, they file new ones.
[01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:47.280]  But the group that sued Remington into bankruptcy, they lost the case.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.041]  But the same group is now suing me in Connecticut.
[01:27:50.041 --> 01:27:51.141]  So I'm not whining.
[01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:53.202]  I came to this fight to take on the globalists.
[01:27:53.202 --> 01:27:55.603]  But they are in full gear against Hillary.
[01:27:56.098 --> 01:27:57.640]  Everybody that stands up for the truth.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.601]  Donald Trump.
[01:27:58.601 --> 01:27:59.982]  Myself.
[01:27:59.982 --> 01:28:01.104]  Roger Stone.
[01:28:01.104 --> 01:28:02.745]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:02.745 --> 01:28:03.847]  They've come after my family.
[01:28:03.847 --> 01:28:05.028]  They've tried to take my children away.
[01:28:05.028 --> 01:28:06.389]  You've seen it all on the news.
[01:28:06.389 --> 01:28:07.350]  I'm not complaining.
[01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:12.176]  I'm just saying, if you support us, you pray for us, you back us, we will stand.
[01:28:12.176 --> 01:28:13.157]  We will not be defeated.
[01:28:14.398 --> 01:28:17.039]  Pray about it and decide who you want to support in this fight.
[01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:23.363]  I just know that behind the scenes, I've funded now hundreds of thousands in the child rescue groups here in the U.S.
[01:28:23.363 --> 01:28:25.924]  and we've had big successes with that because I just morally had to do it.
[01:28:25.924 --> 01:28:27.425]  God put it on my heart.
[01:28:27.425 --> 01:28:28.625]  I funded what Tommy's doing.
[01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.246]  I funded what Veritas is doing.
[01:28:30.246 --> 01:28:36.129]  And I'm trying to fund more things and they know I'm doing that so they're really pissed at me because I'm like a super baby Soros.
[01:28:36.129 --> 01:28:40.391]  And I've only given out probably a million dollars over the years to groups fighting tyranny.
[01:28:40.391 --> 01:28:43.153]  I haven't given out 50 billion like Soros because I don't have the money.
[01:28:43.834 --> 01:28:49.660]  And I just want to take the money we get here from you to just maximize our fight back against them.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.222]  Nationwide, worldwide protest.
[01:28:51.222 --> 01:28:54.666]  We're going to break down some final points with Kalen Robertson straight ahead.
[01:28:57.358 --> 01:29:00.420]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:04.402]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:04.402 --> 01:29:05.642]  The Bug-A-Salt.

[01:29:58.277 --> 01:30:05.901]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:13.824]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:30:13.824 --> 01:30:16.926]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:30:17.546 --> 01:30:22.191]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:30:22.191 --> 01:30:26.314]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:30:26.314 --> 01:30:29.477]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:30:29.477 --> 01:30:34.242]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:30:34.242 --> 01:30:37.285]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:30:37.685 --> 01:30:52.779]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:30:52.779 --> 01:30:54.320]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.442]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:02.143]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.143 --> 01:31:04.886]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:31:04.886 --> 01:31:09.690]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.

[01:33:15.794 --> 01:33:17.475]  Big Brother.
[01:33:17.475 --> 01:33:20.678]  Mainstream Media.
[01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:21.799]  Government Cover-Ups.
[01:33:23.277 --> 01:33:25.138]  You want answers?
[01:33:25.138 --> 01:33:27.079]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:33.482]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.072 --> 01:33:51.015]  Kalen Robertson is Tommy Robinson's manager, an amazing researcher, camera person that kicked out of university for just mildly criticizing Islam a few years ago and is now on the front lines of the fight the last year and a half with Tommy.
[01:33:51.015 --> 01:34:04.477]  Tommy is a world-famous political prisoner of the West now and you just got the exclusive on what happened at the 30-minute trial and sentencing not for his previous
[01:34:05.768 --> 01:34:06.468]  Suspended sentence.
[01:34:06.468 --> 01:34:09.429]  The judge said no for what you've done.
[01:34:09.429 --> 01:34:10.269]  Incredible.
[01:34:10.269 --> 01:34:18.252]  And then during the break, he gave us the latest talking to Tommy this morning while he was there with his wife.
[01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:26.414]  And so you're going to hear the latest from Tommy directly from Kalen about this big demonstration that Tommy wants to happen on June 9th.
[01:34:26.414 --> 01:34:29.975]  This is the exclusive directly from Tommy's manager.
[01:34:29.975 --> 01:34:31.256]  So Kalen, lay this out for us.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:36.581]  Well, we can only get very, very tiny snippets of information from Tommy each day.
[01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:38.882]  Very, very tiny number of seconds.
[01:34:38.882 --> 01:34:48.125]  But this morning we actually made contact and we wanted to see if he wanted to still go ahead with us, you know, working with these demonstrations and actually pulling something together.
[01:34:48.125 --> 01:34:49.866]  And he said, why don't we do it on the 9th?
[01:34:49.866 --> 01:34:50.726]  I fully support that.
[01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:51.846]  Do it outside Downing Street.
[01:34:51.846 --> 01:34:53.007]  Do it where we did Day for Freedom.
[01:34:54.224 --> 01:34:54.825]  Go ahead.
[01:34:54.825 --> 01:34:58.368]  So that's Tommy's public endorsement of what we want to do on the 9th.
[01:34:58.368 --> 01:35:02.651]  The 9th that's coming up this month, right outside Downing Street, as I said, where we did Day for Freedom.
[01:35:02.651 --> 01:35:04.673]  We want to get as many people there as possible.
[01:35:04.673 --> 01:35:14.741]  I'm still going to be working with people who can perhaps be speaking, but we just want to have the biggest show of basically force and support of Tommy that's ever happened in Britain.
[01:35:14.741 --> 01:35:16.502]  So that's going to go ahead.
[01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:18.204]  That's the first time it's been mentioned.
[01:35:18.204 --> 01:35:20.526]  And yeah, it's under Tommy's approval.
[01:35:20.526 --> 01:35:22.287]  It's what he wants to go ahead with.
[01:35:25.006 --> 01:35:26.187]  Very, very historic.
[01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:29.210]  You know, I know his wife's very, very private.
[01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:31.992]  When I've been talking to Tommy and stuff, I've only talked to her a few times.
[01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:44.283]  I know that the last times he's been thrown in prison for standing up for little children that have been kidnapped and raped and mashed, that his children were small enough to not really know what happened to Daddy, but now they are.
[01:35:44.283 --> 01:35:46.865]  Can you just repeat any of what you told me off air?
[01:35:48.263 --> 01:35:52.249]  Yeah, I wouldn't really want to go into too much detail about Tommy's personal family.
[01:35:52.249 --> 01:35:57.377]  It's very, very separate, but obviously it's a really, really tough situation.
[01:35:57.377 --> 01:36:02.344]  The last time they did this, the last time the tyrannical government decided to pull him away and take him away and harass him,
[01:36:03.268 --> 01:36:29.737]  You know his children were very very young and they didn't even realize that what was really sort of going on and now that they're at an age where they're sort of trying to be able to comprehend this it's even it's even more sort of traumatic it's even more difficult it's a lot more pressure for his wife and it's really really sort of heartbreaking seeing her go go through all this obviously she's still keeping positive focused on the legal process there's still a huge amount of donations which are coming in which are going to be supporting that and that's giving her hope but internally it's a huge huge
[01:36:30.537 --> 01:36:37.864]  And that's because, correct me if I'm wrong, most people that criticize Islam that are activists that get put in prison either get killed or close to killed.
[01:36:49.073 --> 01:36:54.998]  Well, look what happened with the man who threw the bacon sandwich outside the mosque, or who left one there and he died in prison.
[01:36:54.998 --> 01:36:55.858]  You don't murder in prison.
[01:36:55.858 --> 01:36:57.940]  We have cases like that up and down the country.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.001]  Really, really scary.
[01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:07.347]  A lot of these judges and a lot of our politicians know that if you jail somebody for criticising Islam, you're not just putting them away for a few months, you're giving them a life sentence.
[01:37:07.347 --> 01:37:09.509]  You're actually giving them the death sentence.
[01:37:09.509 --> 01:37:11.930]  That's how you can sweep people away and get rid of them.
[01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:14.673]  And it's obviously a major, major worry.
[01:37:14.673 --> 01:37:17.675]  We've already obviously acknowledged yesterday that it's something like that.
[01:37:18.035 --> 01:37:18.755]  Yeah, it's extremely worrying.
[01:37:32.927 --> 01:37:35.269]  Amazing, my friend.
[01:37:35.269 --> 01:37:38.593]  You have been there when the Antifa attacks you guys, ten to one.
[01:37:38.593 --> 01:37:48.022]  You have been there through the demonization of lies, just a minute or two on what it's like your last year and a half with Tommy Robinson on the front lines of the Islamic invasion.
[01:37:49.212 --> 01:37:50.953]  Well, it's been a rollercoaster.
[01:37:50.953 --> 01:37:53.295]  It was absolutely intense.
[01:37:53.295 --> 01:37:55.017]  The support has been completely unreal.
[01:37:55.017 --> 01:37:58.560]  When I first met Tommy, I thought he was sort of the most hated man in Britain.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:06.246]  I thought it was only a couple of thousand people that might actually be supporting him, given by the fact I only knew what was going on about him from the press, which would have you believe that.
[01:38:06.246 --> 01:38:15.274]  But it was absolutely incredible going up and down and seeing people shake his hand from universities, from upper class, middle class, working class neighbourhoods.
[01:38:15.274 --> 01:38:15.454]  It was
[01:38:16.034 --> 01:38:19.696]  It was really, really overwhelming but obviously incredibly stressful as well.
[01:38:19.696 --> 01:38:35.063]  There's video footage of us getting into Muslim no-go zones up and down the UK where we went to go to a Muslim MP's house who had defended a grooming gang and then loads of Muslim men in cars kind of drove around and bumped into our car and smashed all the windows.
[01:38:35.063 --> 01:38:43.626]  There was obviously extreme violence we witnessed and all of my worst fears about the UK had been confirmed in those sort of eight months of working with him.
[01:38:45.127 --> 01:38:47.128]  But we just didn't expect this to happen.
[01:38:47.128 --> 01:38:48.869]  We didn't expect this to ever happen again.
[01:38:48.869 --> 01:38:55.593]  We kind of thought there might even be a bit more of an immunity now because of the internet and because of his massive profile.
[01:38:55.593 --> 01:38:58.375]  He's gone from sort of here to right, right to the top.
[01:38:58.375 --> 01:39:00.536]  And we thought it would never, ever happen again.
[01:39:00.536 --> 01:39:03.478]  But yeah, it's been very, very overwhelming.
[01:39:03.478 --> 01:39:06.560]  But also, it's actually been, excluding this case,
[01:39:07.583 --> 01:39:15.009]  Quite a positive thing, seeing how all the incredible projects he's been doing has been waking the country up.
[01:39:15.009 --> 01:39:18.152]  It's just such a shame what's happened recently.
[01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:24.137]  But when he does get out, and we believe that we can fight this and do that, he's not going to be deterred.
[01:39:24.137 --> 01:39:35.326]  Speaking to him earlier on today, he's still standing strong, he's still standing positive, and he's going to come out guns blazing as soon as it's done, going at 100 miles an hour, and going to carry on doing everything he was doing before.
[01:39:36.408 --> 01:39:36.988]  Amazing!
[01:39:36.988 --> 01:39:40.329]  All right, well we'll be talking to you today, tomorrow, checking in.
[01:39:40.329 --> 01:39:43.770]  I know Harrison Smith's going to be hooking up with you very, very soon.
[01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:45.311]  He and the camera lady he's with.
[01:39:45.311 --> 01:39:47.251]  So again, thank you so much.
[01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:49.432]  We really appreciate what you're doing.
[01:39:49.432 --> 01:39:53.233]  Again, that is Kaelin with a C. Kaelin Robb on Twitter.
[01:39:53.233 --> 01:39:55.674]  Everybody should follow you there as well.
[01:39:55.674 --> 01:39:56.974]  That's Kaelin Robb.
[01:39:56.974 --> 01:39:58.235]  One word, Kaelin Robb.
[01:39:58.235 --> 01:40:00.455]  There it is on screen for TV viewers.
[01:40:00.455 --> 01:40:05.757]  This has been a major breaking news on the ninth protest that Tommy's calling for.
[01:40:06.557 --> 01:40:17.824]  From prison and even bigger news the exclusive now that the notice has been raised on what happened in his sentencing The judge saying you're giving 13 months not for last time for this.
[01:40:17.824 --> 01:40:19.165]  I'm sending you to prison.
[01:40:19.165 --> 01:40:19.705]  So Kalen.
[01:40:19.705 --> 01:40:20.306]  Thank you so much
[01:40:22.025 --> 01:40:23.106]  Thanks for having me.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.542]  German members of Parliament going public, offering him asylum.
[01:40:42.542 --> 01:40:46.024]  This is Chinese Communist-level control in the UK.
[01:40:46.024 --> 01:40:57.291]  And joining us for this segment, the next segment, and part of the next, we played a statement earlier from a few days ago, is Godfrey Bloom, military historian, former fiery member of the EU Parliament who helped get Brexit through.
[01:40:57.291 --> 01:41:03.335]  Now that we know more about Tommy, because there was a news blackout, now that you've had a chance to look at this, what do you make of it, Mr. Bloom?
[01:41:05.431 --> 01:41:08.352]  Well, this of course, we need to go back.
[01:41:08.352 --> 01:41:14.775]  We're talking about, you know, the last few days, but we actually need to go back to the administration of Tony Blair in 1997.
[01:41:14.775 --> 01:41:27.061]  This is when the constitution, the British constitution, was allowed deliberately to deteriorate so this kind of behaviour by government, they could get away with this.
[01:41:27.061 --> 01:41:33.204]  So what they did, they destroyed the House of Lords, they reformed the House of Lords to pack it with their own people,
[01:41:33.764 --> 01:41:40.949]  Uh, with their own Lords who were, uh, people who were put there by Tony Blair because they were political cronies.
[01:41:40.949 --> 01:41:41.970]  So they're the people there.
[01:41:41.970 --> 01:41:45.253]  So we have a House of Lords which is corrupted.
[01:41:45.253 --> 01:41:47.154]  So we have a law which is corrupted.
[01:41:47.154 --> 01:41:51.537]  We have a judiciary which is now part of the political system.
[01:41:51.537 --> 01:41:57.902]  We have a Crown Prosecution Service, uh, which, uh, was politicized by Tony Blair.
[01:41:57.902 --> 01:42:00.984]  Uh, and the Prosecution Service was taken away
[01:42:01.561 --> 01:42:01.921]  They've now
[01:42:23.559 --> 01:42:23.719]  I think
[01:42:44.104 --> 01:42:49.388]  Twitter, we have that on screen for everybody that would like to be able to follow him.
[01:42:49.388 --> 01:42:52.871]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.

[01:44:59.794 --> 01:45:08.359]  The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top.
[01:45:08.359 --> 01:45:09.940]  The real red pill.
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:15.464]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:45:15.464 --> 01:45:18.466]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:18.466 --> 01:45:27.252]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:45:29.332 --> 01:45:39.599]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:48.926]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:51.608]  It is amazing!
[01:45:51.608 --> 01:45:56.572]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:45:58.743 --> 01:46:03.585]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:03.585 --> 01:46:12.488]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:46:12.488 --> 01:46:17.829]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:46:17.829 --> 01:46:26.092]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:46:26.212 --> 01:46:26.532]  I think so.
[01:46:55.851 --> 01:47:02.133]  World is a dangerous place.
[01:47:22.472 --> 01:47:30.955]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:30.955 --> 01:47:35.317]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:35.317 --> 01:47:39.498]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:39.498 --> 01:47:41.099]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:51.280]  Yeah, putting on our little fight against the globalists, but they now recognize that, so they pulled out all the stops and are trying to shut down InfoWars.
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:59.405]  They have had the FBI talk with 13 people, including army officers, you name it, and the questioning now centers around a U.S.
[01:47:59.405 --> 01:48:01.586]  coup to steal the election from Hillary.
[01:48:01.586 --> 01:48:06.409]  They're now breaking away from Russia, and they're trying to claim that I am at the center of it.
[01:48:07.577 --> 01:48:09.158]  That's how insane this has gotten.
[01:48:09.158 --> 01:48:14.461]  This is a conspiracy of wanting freedom and being open about it and promoting it.
[01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:20.224]  So in Europe, in England, and all over, they're adopting Chinese-style oppression.
[01:48:20.224 --> 01:48:23.466]  Secret police, commissars, political crimes.
[01:48:23.466 --> 01:48:28.048]  We're gonna break big news later in the broadcast about Starbucks and what's behind all this stuff.
[01:48:28.048 --> 01:48:28.928]  This is the plan.
[01:48:28.928 --> 01:48:30.569]  That's why England's so important.
[01:48:30.569 --> 01:48:34.812]  The Magna Carta and then everything we have here grew in common law out of that.
[01:48:35.737 --> 01:48:41.144]  They had parliamentary votes where most of the British were for us not being able to be under the Crown because it was being oppressive.
[01:48:41.144 --> 01:48:44.089]  Then the King came and addressed Parliament and they voted for the war.
[01:48:44.089 --> 01:48:47.914]  You think of like England as the enemy when we came from England.
[01:48:47.914 --> 01:48:52.059]  And now that basic system has fallen to classical tyranny.
[01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:59.445]  A decade after they predicted it would happen, or 16, 17, 18 years after they predicted it, it's now unfolded.
[01:48:59.445 --> 01:49:01.306]  I guess it's already 20 years after.
[01:49:01.306 --> 01:49:05.709]  And so Godfrey Bloom is our guest, historian, former member of the EU Parliament.
[01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:14.615]  He was getting into the basics, and now it's devolved, and this authoritarianism is merging nicely with Sharia law and political correctness.
[01:49:14.615 --> 01:49:21.880]  And this has really got people to wake up, though, these images of these demonstrations, and not reporting on what's happened.
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.081]  All the other things.
[01:49:24.081 --> 01:49:35.288]  You were saying, when you talked to the producer, that that's going to break the dam towards people being aware of some of the other political prisoners, Mr. Bloom.
[01:49:35.288 --> 01:49:36.629]  Yes, indeed it is.
[01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:40.792]  Ronald Reagan isn't the only one, of course.
[01:49:40.792 --> 01:49:44.294]  There's another major one over here, Marilyn Moore.
[01:49:44.294 --> 01:49:51.699]  But she blew the whistle on sex abuse by senior members, politicians and policemen and so on and so forth, in Nottingham.
[01:49:53.387 --> 01:49:54.067]  Godfrey, you're over in the UK.
[01:49:54.067 --> 01:49:55.748]  Your Skype's a bit hiccup-y right now.
[01:49:55.748 --> 01:49:57.809]  Tell us the name of the lady again and start over.
[01:50:14.273 --> 01:50:23.680]  Melanie Shaw, who was a whistleblower on the problems that the sexual abuse case, it was a sexual abuse case in Nottingham.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.841]  She blew the whistle on it.
[01:50:24.841 --> 01:50:28.223]  She was in a home, an orphan's home.
[01:50:28.223 --> 01:50:35.489]  She blew the whistle and now she's sedated in solitary confinement in Tipperary prison.
[01:50:35.489 --> 01:50:41.314]  Well, I used the term commissar when you said political crimes, but that was their specialty in the old Soviet Union, wasn't it?
[01:50:41.314 --> 01:50:41.734]  Drugging you?
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:53.301]  Wasn't that their specialty, Godfrey Bloom, and the old Soviet Union would be grabbing people and drugging them?
[01:50:53.301 --> 01:50:57.502]  Well, yes, indeed it is, and it's unbelievable that we've got here, but of course they've degraded.
[01:50:57.502 --> 01:51:09.404]  We have a Bill of Rights, we have a Toleration Act, we have a parliamentary system, we have a Court of Appeal, and 20 years ago, if Tommy Robinson was to appeal this, it would be granted immediately.
[01:51:09.404 --> 01:51:10.424]  There was no question about it.
[01:51:10.424 --> 01:51:12.225]  This whole thing is a stitch-up.
[01:51:12.225 --> 01:51:14.305]  It's totally against the fundamental principle
[01:51:15.174 --> 01:51:15.374]  Please.
[01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:52.246]  And I found a gold watch in a drawer in your house, which you'd forgotten you had, and I stole it.
[01:51:52.246 --> 01:51:57.550]  It would be years before, A, you realised it had gone, and B, who could possibly have stolen it?
[01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:58.471]  It would be impossible.
[01:51:58.471 --> 01:52:00.052]  So, this is what they do.
[01:52:00.052 --> 01:52:03.295]  They make sure that people don't know what their historical rights are in law.
[01:52:04.005 --> 01:52:05.705]  And it makes them easier to take away.
[01:52:05.705 --> 01:52:18.068]  And of course, what you get then is a very frustrated populace, which we have at the moment, who don't really understand what Tommy Robinson's done, they don't understand what Melanie Shaw has done, and these other people.
[01:52:18.068 --> 01:52:26.870]  And as it comes out, people are now beginning to realise just how far down the path to a totalitarian state we've gone.
[01:52:28.979 --> 01:52:29.439]  Incredible.
[01:52:29.439 --> 01:52:30.740]  Yeah, there's the article.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:33.302]  Child abuse witness held in Peterborough Prison.
[01:52:33.302 --> 01:52:34.223]  Drugged.
[01:52:34.223 --> 01:52:35.464]  Key whistleblower.
[01:52:35.464 --> 01:52:37.225]  Unbelievable.
[01:52:37.225 --> 01:52:40.528]  And I'm told that's why they're coming after me is exposing the pedophilia.
[01:52:40.528 --> 01:52:45.732]  And I've been told if I don't shut up, if I don't stop funding investigators, that I'm going to basically be executed.
[01:52:45.732 --> 01:52:46.792]  Well, whatever then.
[01:52:46.792 --> 01:52:48.674]  Somebody's got to stand up for these children.
[01:52:48.674 --> 01:52:50.075]  It's not heroics.
[01:52:50.075 --> 01:52:51.956]  It's basic instinct.
[01:52:51.956 --> 01:52:52.617]  But as you said,
[01:52:53.297 --> 01:52:55.958]  English common law is the basis of our law here.
[01:52:55.958 --> 01:52:57.099]  It's being stolen there.
[01:52:57.099 --> 01:52:58.179]  It's being stolen here.
[01:52:58.179 --> 01:53:03.081]  We're just a few years, three or four, five years behind you in some areas already just as bad.
[01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:06.182]  And if you don't know you have a freedom, it can be stolen much easier.
[01:53:06.182 --> 01:53:16.227]  People are having their birthrights stolen, and as a great teaching moment, they're teaching you we can secretly arrest Tommy Robinson, put him in a prison, and then order the media not to report on it.
[01:53:16.227 --> 01:53:17.087]  That is just incredible.
[01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:29.996]  Yes, and I think we don't know, do we, how many other people have been arrested that we don't know about because they didn't have a political profile.
[01:53:29.996 --> 01:53:31.036]  And you can go right back.
[01:53:31.036 --> 01:53:34.819]  I don't know whether you remember the shooting in Dunblane, the mass shooting in Dunblane.
[01:53:34.819 --> 01:53:34.919]  Yes.
[01:53:34.919 --> 01:53:38.001]  There was a massive inquiry into that about two decades ago.
[01:53:38.001 --> 01:53:41.603]  And that overturned a very big paedophile ring.
[01:53:41.603 --> 01:53:42.644]  And that was closed down.
[01:53:42.644 --> 01:53:43.605]  There have been books on it.
[01:53:43.605 --> 01:53:44.665]  Why was it all closed down?
[01:53:45.486 --> 01:53:51.412]  The investigation was closed down and the whispers were some very senior government ministers were involved.
[01:53:51.412 --> 01:54:04.205]  And of course if you look at, I'm not allowed to speak about certain things here, but if you drill down on some of the things coming up, there's some extraordinary people involved in all this.
[01:54:05.148 --> 01:54:10.473]  That's right, there it is, a big political cover-up, 1980s pedophile ring, Washington Post and UK Parliament.
[01:54:10.473 --> 01:54:13.855]  But that was the old Washington Post before Jeff Bezos bought it.
[01:54:13.855 --> 01:54:16.097]  You won't be hearing about that anymore.
[01:54:16.097 --> 01:54:19.841]  And historically, we saw this in Rome, we saw this in other areas, they would use
[01:54:20.461 --> 01:54:41.473]  Pedophile rings to compromise and control people because pretty much every culture would not put up with buggering children And so really this is the evil thing that welds all of these networks together We know the EU has unbelievable giant pedophile schemes Satanism little kids in cages found dead In the Netherlands.
[01:54:41.473 --> 01:54:45.796]  I mean this is this all comes out, but then gets shut down and then here you are
[01:54:46.616 --> 01:54:55.943]  You know, famous member of EU Parliament, you name it, and you can't even talk about it because they've put D notices in now on the citizens not to talk about it.
[01:54:55.943 --> 01:54:57.704]  That is incredible, Godfrey Blum.
[01:55:02.055 --> 01:55:06.178]  Yes, and of course the mainstream media go along with it.
[01:55:06.178 --> 01:55:07.758]  The mainstream media go along with it.
[01:55:07.758 --> 01:55:12.521]  But what you've got to understand is that the BBC is a state broadcaster.
[01:55:12.521 --> 01:55:15.703]  The governor of the BBC, the trustees are all selected by government.
[01:55:15.703 --> 01:55:18.144]  Channel 4 is a publicly owned company.
[01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:22.427]  You can't broadcast on Sky TV, for example, without a licence.
[01:55:22.427 --> 01:55:25.869]  So all mainstream media is very tightly controlled by the government.
[01:55:27.321 --> 01:55:28.782]  And it begs the question, does it not?
[01:55:28.782 --> 01:55:31.264]  I was talking to a colleague about this earlier on today.
[01:55:31.264 --> 01:55:33.606]  There seems to be a disproportionate amount of...
[01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:43.320]  ...files in the political system and one wonders, does one not, whether politics actually attracts these weird people.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.003]  Most politicians to me, I don't know about you over there, but they all seem weird.
[01:55:47.003 --> 01:55:53.507]  They're weird people, they don't have any friends, they didn't play team sports when they were at college, they're all weird people.
[01:55:53.507 --> 01:56:00.292]  I think perhaps this predilection for children, or kiddie fiddling as we call it over here, is perhaps in the political psyche.
[01:56:01.755 --> 01:56:09.558]  When I come back, you're a well-known historian and obviously worked in Parliament at the EU, so you understand what's happening.
[01:56:09.558 --> 01:56:14.700]  I think these people are attractive, but then they set up organizations of compromise through intelligence agencies.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.801]  Cheating on your wife isn't enough to compromise you now.
[01:56:17.861 --> 01:56:20.864]  Your wife, in modern times, might want to join in.
[01:56:20.864 --> 01:56:23.646]  So now it's got to be the kids to compromise people.
[01:56:23.646 --> 01:56:24.947]  It's not enough to be gay.
[01:56:24.947 --> 01:56:32.453]  And so it's a rite of passage, from my research, into many of these satanic, corrupt networks, to do really bad things, to become a made member of the gang.
[01:56:32.453 --> 01:56:35.435]  We'll talk to Godfrey Bloom for five more minutes when we come back.
[01:56:35.435 --> 01:56:36.436]  GodfreyBloom.UK.
[01:56:36.436 --> 01:56:40.279]  You can also follow him on Twitter.
[01:56:40.279 --> 01:56:41.480]  We'll put that on screen.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:44.862]  That's GoddersBloom, at GoddersBloom on Twitter.
[01:56:47.694 --> 01:56:52.762]  We are running free shipping on all of our best-selling items for the week of Memorial Day.
[01:56:52.762 --> 01:56:56.047]  Memorial Week sales right now running throughout the week.
[01:56:56.047 --> 01:56:58.972]  These are some of the biggest sales we've ever offered.
[01:57:00.407 --> 01:57:05.934]  The high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, some of those are discounted 50%.

[01:57:09.358 --> 01:57:12.702]  That's huge on the food because a lot of the cost is the shipping.
[01:57:12.702 --> 01:57:17.909]  So 50% off the storable food and on the three-month, six-month, one-month, and the free shipping.
[01:57:17.909 --> 01:57:18.349]  That's huge.
[01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:23.371]  X2, the good halogen, 50% off with Biotricillinium.
[01:57:23.371 --> 01:57:27.692]  BrainForce, amazing nootropic, 50% off with free shipping.
[01:57:27.692 --> 01:57:28.472]  I can't go over it all.
[01:57:28.472 --> 01:57:29.793]  It'll take 20 minutes to do.
[01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:42.836]  These are big sales and they help you and your family get great products while funding an institution, InfoWars, that is under sustained attack by these very child-fiddling networks.
[01:57:42.836 --> 01:57:45.117]  We are going on to the end no matter what happens.
[01:57:45.117 --> 01:57:46.077]  We've only begun to fight.
[01:57:46.077 --> 01:57:46.477]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.383 --> 01:57:51.066]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[01:57:51.066 --> 01:57:59.073]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[01:57:59.073 --> 01:58:05.758]  With InfoWars Life Select Storable Food, you can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.

[01:58:39.139 --> 01:58:45.587]  Make sure you're stocked up today with all the food you need for an affordable price with InfoWars Life Select storable foods.
[01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:55.835]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:55.835 --> 01:59:03.759]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:59:03.759 --> 01:59:06.841]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:59:07.461 --> 01:59:12.125]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:59:12.125 --> 01:59:16.249]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:19.391]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:59:19.391 --> 01:59:24.155]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:59:24.155 --> 01:59:27.198]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:59:27.618 --> 01:59:42.687]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:42.687 --> 01:59:44.228]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.228 --> 01:59:51.352]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:59:51.352 --> 01:59:53.993]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.894 --> 02:00:10.838]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:10.838 --> 02:00:12.279]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:19.251]  This is the syndicated radio broadcast that turned into a TV broadcast 15 years ago.
[02:00:19.251 --> 02:00:22.392]  It's on the air 23 years, and let me tell you, I've seen the whole world change.
[02:00:22.392 --> 02:00:32.914]  The globalists, the evil forces are on the run, but their counter-strike is serious authoritarianism against anybody that sticks their head up too high in an attempt to intimidate people.
[02:00:32.914 --> 02:00:43.737]  Godfrey Bloom, you were, as a historian, not just a former member of the EU Parliament, one of the leaders of Brexit, getting into the proclivity of the high concentration in some of these elite circles of pedophilia.
[02:00:44.717 --> 02:00:49.999]  And you heard me get into the fact that, from my sources, they're using it to compromise folks.
[02:00:49.999 --> 02:00:54.720]  Even people that don't want to do it are told to get into it or they're not in the club.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.362]  What's your intel on that and other ways to turn the tide against this?
[02:01:05.833 --> 02:01:06.834]  That's Godfrey Bloom.
[02:01:06.834 --> 02:01:08.095]  His Skype's usually good.
[02:01:08.095 --> 02:01:11.377]  We've had some real problems with it today, but that's the beauty of Skype.
[02:01:11.377 --> 02:01:13.259]  It's like we're talking to somebody.
[02:01:13.259 --> 02:01:15.380]  How far away is England from Texas?
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:17.542]  5,000, 6,000 miles?
[02:01:17.542 --> 02:01:19.963]  So, Godfrey, you're back.
[02:01:19.963 --> 02:01:21.905]  What are they using the pedophiles for in government?
[02:01:21.905 --> 02:01:26.408]  To compromise people?
[02:01:26.408 --> 02:01:32.232]  Well, it's the one thing that an accusation of you can't bounce back from.
[02:01:32.232 --> 02:01:33.733]  If it does, if the cat gets out of the...
[02:01:34.537 --> 02:01:45.922]  As you rightly said, Alex, if it's just straightforward embezzlement or it's fraud or it's adultery, anything goes in politics these days.
[02:01:45.922 --> 02:01:48.363]  But this is something you can't bounce back from.
[02:01:48.363 --> 02:01:51.344]  So if it's paedophilia, it's very, very difficult to get out of.
[02:01:51.344 --> 02:01:55.505]  So it's a huge blackmail hole all over people.
[02:01:55.505 --> 02:01:59.407]  But of course, the other problem that we have is that these
[02:02:00.228 --> 02:02:06.017]  Blasphemy laws and the laws that all go with this are only one sided.
[02:02:07.576 --> 02:02:14.260]  And so it's only one section of the community that suffers from these sort of things, and it's the indigenous population.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:17.462]  And this is what is making people so angry.
[02:02:17.462 --> 02:02:23.846]  You can criticize Christianity as much as you like, but if you criticize Islam, you go to prison.
[02:02:23.846 --> 02:02:26.767]  This isn't a blasphemy act that's equal.
[02:02:26.767 --> 02:02:31.730]  This is a one-sided blasphemy act, and we got rid of the concept of blasphemy in 1683.
[02:02:33.192 --> 02:02:34.614]  ...with the Toleration Acts.
[02:02:34.614 --> 02:02:42.067]  We've gone back hundreds of years now because the one side controlled the shots.
[02:02:42.657 --> 02:02:47.140]  In the same way, one might argue that up until the Toleration Acts, it was the other side.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:52.684]  In Northern Europe, it was the Protestants that controlled it, and in Southern Europe, it was the Catholics that controlled it.
[02:02:52.684 --> 02:02:56.807]  But we have this quite extraordinary situation at the moment, where we've gone back to thought police.
[02:02:56.807 --> 02:03:01.791]  You know, if you have a bad thought, somebody's only got to complain that they're offended.
[02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:10.977]  If you criticize them for their sexual predilections, or their faith, their religious faith, a criticism means that you can get arrested for that.
[02:03:13.061 --> 02:03:16.323]  So, that actually closes down free speech of any sort.
[02:03:16.323 --> 02:03:22.086]  And that's the whole basis for the British way of life, and indeed the American way of life, is free speech.
[02:03:22.086 --> 02:03:22.906]  And that's gone.
[02:03:22.906 --> 02:03:27.909]  And I've been doing podcasts on this now for nearly six months.
[02:03:27.909 --> 02:03:30.310]  And I've been leading up to this.
[02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:35.473]  This Tommy Robinson thing and this Melanie Shaw thing are a natural progression of this.
[02:03:37.369 --> 02:03:43.337]  Well said, but seeing demonstrations pop up all over the world and seeing the anger, I think people are starting to wake up.
[02:03:43.337 --> 02:03:47.142]  I mean, you see the populism, the nationalism, you see Italy about to explode.
[02:03:47.142 --> 02:03:50.446]  I mean, I really think that the globalists are in trouble.
[02:03:54.912 --> 02:03:56.794]  Again, Godfrey Bloom has been our guest.
[02:03:56.794 --> 02:03:59.456]  His Skype's been hiccuping, but we'll use that as a point to go.
[02:03:59.456 --> 02:04:00.516]  He's really a smart guy.
[02:04:00.516 --> 02:04:07.162]  I'm going to try to get him with a better internet connection, because I want him to be a contributor and join us a lot more often, because he really knows his stuff.
[02:04:07.162 --> 02:04:08.403]  Godfrey, I see your Skype's back.
[02:04:08.403 --> 02:04:09.443]  We've got about 30 seconds.
[02:04:09.443 --> 02:04:12.786]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:12.786 --> 02:04:13.567]  It's a great pleasure.
[02:04:13.567 --> 02:04:14.487]  Sorry about the connection.
[02:04:14.487 --> 02:04:15.909]  Don't know quite why.
[02:04:15.909 --> 02:04:17.430]  It's been perfect over the last few weeks.
[02:04:17.984 --> 02:04:19.025]  Well, we'll see what's going on.
[02:04:19.025 --> 02:04:19.586]  God bless you.
[02:04:19.586 --> 02:04:20.847]  You did a great job.
[02:04:20.847 --> 02:04:22.108]  Really, really, really amazing points.
[02:04:22.108 --> 02:04:23.069]  Thank you.
[02:04:23.069 --> 02:04:33.599]  Again, folks, we're going to come back now and get into the left's coordinated attack worldwide to end free speech and how once that goes, everything else goes.
[02:04:34.738 --> 02:04:37.639]  So they've been attacking the Second Amendment with lawsuits.
[02:04:37.639 --> 02:04:40.620]  Now they're attacking the First Amendment with them.
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:47.923]  And we need Congress, we need the President to move with laws to shield the First Amendment in this country.
[02:04:47.923 --> 02:04:54.105]  We need to break up the big tech giants that are the heart of this anti-American activity.
[02:04:56.607 --> 02:05:03.754]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[02:05:53.001 --> 02:06:00.225]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.851 --> 02:06:17.357]  Tommy Robinson, frequent guest of this show, has been disappeared, given a 13-month sentence in one hour, and there's a national ban on talking about it.
[02:06:17.357 --> 02:06:22.240]  And I've talked to scores of reporters and others who are afraid to even come on air.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:28.444]  Fox News then talked to his lawyer, who said, I can't tell you I'll be arrested.
[02:06:29.264 --> 02:06:31.585]  What was Tommy Robinson reporting on?
[02:06:31.585 --> 02:06:36.546]  Giant confirmed child kidnapping rings nationwide.
[02:06:36.546 --> 02:06:39.126]  Now, if you're watching on some TV, you can see this.
[02:06:39.126 --> 02:06:40.847]  DrudgeReport.com.
[02:06:40.847 --> 02:06:43.888]  Oh look, he's got articles about Tommy Robinson.
[02:06:43.888 --> 02:06:47.208]  Activist Tommy Robinson arrested outside UK court.
[02:06:47.208 --> 02:06:49.429]  Jailed for 13 months on the same day.
[02:06:49.429 --> 02:06:50.169]  Third link.
[02:06:50.169 --> 02:06:51.810]  Judge orders media blackout.
[02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:52.410]  Boom.
[02:06:52.410 --> 02:06:52.970]  Fox News.
[02:06:54.349 --> 02:06:57.891]  Fox News folks, something has gone wrong.
[02:06:57.891 --> 02:07:02.493]  It seems you clicked on a bad link and stumbled upon a 404 error.
[02:07:02.493 --> 02:07:14.479]  But when you see somebody like Tommy Robinson, who 11 years ago was the first person to expose Muslim grooming and mass sex trafficking rings.
[02:07:14.479 --> 02:07:16.860]  Yeah, this was basically the story of how police
[02:07:25.939 --> 02:07:29.362]  Here with slave caravans and slave women and slave children being sold.
[02:07:53.271 --> 02:08:00.913]  For 6,000 plus years of recorded history in North Africa, in the Middle East, and in Central Asia.
[02:08:00.913 --> 02:08:03.794]  By the way, there are other cultures were selling slaves as well.
[02:08:03.794 --> 02:08:10.136]  It's just those cultures never came up to the 21st century.
[02:08:10.136 --> 02:08:22.160]  So I have a whole stack of mainstream British news, after 11 years of them covering it up, having to admit that indeed every major town has thousands of little girls and some boys
[02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:24.029]  I don't
[02:08:44.744 --> 02:08:57.569]  Decades, but because of Tommy Robinson breaking the ice, blowing a hole in the line, being put in prison for a year, five years ago over this, and not shutting up, others had the courage to go public.
[02:08:57.569 --> 02:09:03.371]  So the pedophile rings that run England, that's mainstream news, are really angry.
[02:09:03.371 --> 02:09:07.753]  So now they've ordered in the courts that no one report on the trials, period.
[02:09:07.753 --> 02:09:08.673]  Don't even say they exist.
[02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:13.351]  And so Tommy Robinson was arrested on Friday.
[02:09:13.351 --> 02:09:18.034]  He already had a suspended sentence from last year after serving three months in prison.
[02:09:18.034 --> 02:09:25.079]  He had 13 months of it suspended as long as he, quote, wouldn't go into trials and cover them live, which he'd done before.
[02:09:25.079 --> 02:09:28.601]  Like press should be able to do until a few years ago anywhere in the Western world.
[02:09:28.601 --> 02:09:29.882]  It protects pedophilia.
[02:09:29.882 --> 02:09:30.943]  You can go to any other trial you want.
[02:09:32.349 --> 02:09:38.071]  So he just went outside one, I watched the whole live stream after it was archived, and just said they're having a grooming trial here.
[02:09:38.071 --> 02:09:39.991]  Didn't say the details, any of that.
[02:09:39.991 --> 02:09:42.072]  Now this is all confirmed.
[02:09:42.072 --> 02:09:43.772]  We reported on it Friday and Saturday.
[02:09:43.772 --> 02:09:46.253]  Fox News has a big article that details it.
[02:09:46.253 --> 02:09:51.174]  It's up on InfoWars.com because they removed the Fox News article, it just disappeared.
[02:09:51.174 --> 02:09:54.695]  Not corrected, the one that judges linked to, it's just gone.
[02:09:54.695 --> 02:10:00.297]  Fox News confirms Tommy Robinson sentenced to 13 months for reporting on pedophile grooming trial.
[02:10:01.533 --> 02:10:05.616]  Here's the Fox News article that's been deleted.
[02:10:05.616 --> 02:10:07.677]  The link that Drudge is linked to has been deleted.
[02:10:07.677 --> 02:10:14.121]  Right-wing activist Tommy Robinson reportedly jailed after filming outside child grooming trial.
[02:10:14.121 --> 02:10:14.882]  This is Fox News.
[02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:18.443]  Confirming everything we already told you.
[02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:21.545]  But it says, it's shocking, his lawyer isn't allowed to talk to us.
[02:10:21.545 --> 02:10:23.707]  He says this is a police state.
[02:10:23.707 --> 02:10:26.629]  My own listeners yesterday afternoon, I was shooting live reports.
[02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:30.172]  They were like, Alex, there's not a ban on reporting on Tommy Robinson.
[02:10:30.172 --> 02:10:33.835]  And they started commenting, and the feed's going, oh, we apologize, there is.
[02:10:33.835 --> 02:10:35.697]  Oh my God, you can do that in England?
[02:10:35.697 --> 02:10:35.937]  Yeah.
[02:10:53.236 --> 02:10:55.298]  We are drugged out!
[02:10:55.298 --> 02:10:57.601]  We are following other people's opinions!
[02:10:58.735 --> 02:11:01.536]  We are controlled by the media.
[02:11:01.536 --> 02:11:03.396]  Today, it all changes.
[02:11:03.396 --> 02:11:06.157]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[02:11:06.157 --> 02:11:09.258]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[02:11:09.258 --> 02:11:13.980]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:17.101]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[02:11:17.101 --> 02:11:19.481]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[02:11:19.481 --> 02:11:21.902]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:11:21.902 --> 02:11:23.543]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:11:23.543 --> 02:11:24.743]  We have the resources.
[02:11:27.788 --> 02:11:31.512]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[02:11:31.512 --> 02:11:33.113]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[02:11:33.113 --> 02:11:34.715]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[02:11:34.715 --> 02:11:35.796]  They say Trump's crazy.
[02:11:35.796 --> 02:11:36.877]  They say I'm crazy.
[02:11:36.877 --> 02:11:39.260]  But I'm here to show love.
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:44.405]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[02:11:44.405 --> 02:11:48.549]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:50.331]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:11:56.949 --> 02:12:08.673]  Alright, Mark Rondazza joins us for the Balance of the Hour, a little bit in the next, ahead of David Knight and our key reporting from the EU and from Europe on what's happening.
[02:12:08.673 --> 02:12:18.257]  We're also going to have another corporate lawyer in here, Mr. Nixon, to break down a bunch of different angles that are taking place and unfolding as well.
[02:12:19.321 --> 02:12:29.891]  Now, Mark Randazzi is one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country, and he's also known for taking on basically anybody's case to defend the First Amendment.
[02:12:29.891 --> 02:12:37.158]  But we are now in a climate, not just here but all over the world, where Communist Chinese-style standards are being adopted.
[02:12:37.158 --> 02:12:39.421]  We were just talking during the break, you were already going to come here a week ago,
[02:12:40.888 --> 02:12:52.492]  But now it's the perfect time with Tommy Robinson, who isn't even a racist, and who is exposing the fact that you can't even report on child kidnapping rings that are confirmed when he's the first guy to expose them.
[02:12:52.492 --> 02:12:54.093]  He was put in prison for it.
[02:12:54.093 --> 02:13:01.416]  I just had a former member of the EU Parliament on talking about all the political prisoners there grabbing women that expose pedophilia and putting them in prison.
[02:13:01.416 --> 02:13:04.117]  I mean, Europe is, and the UK is just crazy.
[02:13:05.256 --> 02:13:08.498]  Well, you know, they don't have the same safeguards for freedom of expression that we do.
[02:13:08.498 --> 02:13:20.324]  So in the UK, you know, I saw a little bit of the order and it says that in the interest of justice and making sure there's a fair trial, that there should be no reporting on the trial.
[02:13:20.324 --> 02:13:20.745]  Now that's
[02:13:21.605 --> 02:13:25.587]  Pretty unusual even in the UK, but you can even do that here.
[02:13:25.587 --> 02:13:48.778]  Here we do have the First Amendment balanced against the Sixth Amendment, but it's a really heavy burden because in a democratic society you can't have fair courts, you can't have a fair trial, you can't have a fair justice system unless, you know, as a judge I was before in Nevada one time said in a case, you know, the best way to show the people that your court system is fair and just is to tell them come and see for yourself.
[02:13:49.298 --> 02:13:52.599]  Well, when we can't come and see for ourselves, it certainly raises a question.
[02:13:52.599 --> 02:13:58.201]  But they've expanded it past that with these D notices, where they said, don't even report on Tommy Robinson's arrest.
[02:13:58.201 --> 02:14:01.942]  And don't even report that there is a child-grooming pedophile ring hearing.
[02:14:01.942 --> 02:14:05.583]  Well, that's not inside reporting on the names of the kids or anything.
[02:14:05.583 --> 02:14:05.783]  Sure.
[02:14:05.783 --> 02:14:08.184]  I can see a judge saying, don't report the names of the kids.
[02:14:08.184 --> 02:14:08.464]  Yes.
[02:14:08.464 --> 02:14:09.625]  But they're not doing that.
[02:14:09.625 --> 02:14:12.746]  He's just outside saying, see, I told you that town had that going on.
[02:14:12.746 --> 02:14:13.026]  Boom.
[02:14:13.706 --> 02:14:18.830]  Yeah, I mean, look, as far as the facts that he's reported, I don't know anything about them and, you know, I can't speak to them.
[02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:28.056]  But what I can say is it troubles me when what is supposed to be a democratic country shuts down reporting on anything that's a matter of public concern.
[02:14:28.056 --> 02:14:30.858]  By the way, it was overturned because major papers reported it.
[02:14:30.858 --> 02:14:37.143]  We just had the exclusive on earlier with the man that was there in the court when the judge did it and now it's been overturned today.
[02:14:37.483 --> 02:14:37.703]  Has it?
[02:14:37.703 --> 02:14:38.104]  Well, good news.
[02:14:38.104 --> 02:14:40.285]  He was able to talk about what the judge did.
[02:14:40.285 --> 02:14:43.988]  The judge said, I'm not putting you in jail for violating the last gag order.
[02:14:43.988 --> 02:14:46.190]  I'm putting you in jail for 13 months for what you did today.
[02:14:46.190 --> 02:14:52.115]  And that was standing outside the courthouse saying there is a Muslim grooming gang trial happening inside.
[02:14:52.535 --> 02:14:56.137]  Well, I mean, to go to jail for making a statement like that seems excessive to me.
[02:14:56.137 --> 02:14:59.678]  I mean, if it's defamatory, then let somebody bring a civil case.
[02:14:59.678 --> 02:15:03.900]  But to put someone in prison for something like that just seems troubling to me.
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:08.822]  But, you know, this is not just something that we gotta look across the ocean at as a problem.
[02:15:08.822 --> 02:15:13.945]  You know, here in the U.S., I'm finding more and more cases getting sealed by judges.
[02:15:14.785 --> 02:15:17.249]  Uh, when certain powerful litigants want them to.
[02:15:17.249 --> 02:15:31.008]  Uh, you know, for example, there's a case I'm, I can't talk too, in too much detail on it because I'm working on it, but, uh, Giuffre versus Maxwell is taking place up in, uh, the Southern District of New York, and in that case, the entire case has been sealed for the most part.
[02:15:31.608 --> 02:15:35.089]  And that's because, you know, the judge hasn't really articulated much.
[02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:38.231]  We're before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:15:38.231 --> 02:15:39.251]  Demore versus Google.
[02:15:39.251 --> 02:15:43.413]  James Demore, the dissident from Google.
[02:15:43.413 --> 02:15:48.855]  Google's lawyers have moved to seal that case, and the complaint in that case is now no longer a matter.
[02:15:48.855 --> 02:15:49.815]  By the way, we know why.
[02:15:49.815 --> 02:15:54.077]  They make them worship people as dragons and as golden buildings.
[02:15:54.077 --> 02:15:54.777]  It's totally nuts.
[02:15:55.197 --> 02:15:58.880]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:01.361]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:16:01.361 --> 02:16:03.583]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.
[02:16:03.583 --> 02:16:10.307]  The Biffy Bag is a pocket-sized disposable toilet that fits in your glove box, tackle box, toolbox, backpack or purse.

[02:16:25.317 --> 02:16:27.278]  Heart disease is on the rise.

[02:16:32.599 --> 02:16:34.180]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:42.542]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:17:56.343 --> 02:18:03.269]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[02:18:03.269 --> 02:18:12.057]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.

[02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:36.981]  Thank you.
[02:18:57.017 --> 02:19:01.600]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.161]  Thanks for holding.
[02:19:02.161 --> 02:19:03.602]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:19:03.602 --> 02:19:07.205]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:11.968]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen.
[02:19:11.988 --> 02:19:12.448]  Thank you, bro.
[02:19:32.763 --> 02:19:41.345]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:19:41.345 --> 02:19:46.226]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:19:46.226 --> 02:19:59.288]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[02:19:59.288 --> 02:20:01.929]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.441 --> 02:20:28.805]  Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake And they know half the things I've done they'll never let me in
[02:20:36.224 --> 02:20:40.729]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:40.729 --> 02:20:43.813]  There is so much going on, it is such an insane time to be alive.
[02:20:43.813 --> 02:20:46.536]  We're with Mark Rondazza of rondazzagroup.com.
[02:20:46.536 --> 02:20:47.237]  I knew it was a top
[02:20:47.637 --> 02:20:51.060]  First Amendment lawyer, but then I was talking to one of my lawyers, he said, no, that's one of the top guys.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:52.362]  So it's great to have him here in town.
[02:20:52.362 --> 02:20:56.326]  He's always flying back and forth across the country, has offices in a whole bunch of states.
[02:20:56.326 --> 02:20:58.948]  And so we're blessed to have him here.
[02:20:58.948 --> 02:21:01.491]  Let's get into Roseanne on the First Amendment.
[02:21:01.491 --> 02:21:02.391]  So much here.
[02:21:02.391 --> 02:21:04.293]  Roseanne canceled at ABC following...
[02:21:05.214 --> 02:21:06.876]  Racist Tweet.
[02:21:06.876 --> 02:21:08.737]  Maybe it's the show already started to sink.
[02:21:08.737 --> 02:21:14.423]  Roseanne Barr goes on wild racist tweet storm about Clinton's George Soros and others.
[02:21:14.423 --> 02:21:15.143]  Then I read her tweets.
[02:21:15.143 --> 02:21:17.105]  I didn't really see anything racist in there.
[02:21:17.105 --> 02:21:21.209]  I heard her talking about George Soros and people, but hey, ABC.
[02:21:21.209 --> 02:21:22.290]  She works for them.
[02:21:22.290 --> 02:21:23.151]  It's their contract.
[02:21:23.151 --> 02:21:23.871]  They're allowed to do it.
[02:21:23.871 --> 02:21:24.232]  Just like the NFL.
[02:21:27.094 --> 02:21:27.334]  Yeah.
[02:21:27.334 --> 02:21:27.994]  Your view on that?
[02:21:27.994 --> 02:21:30.595]  Yeah, I mean, look, you know, I saw some of her tweets.
[02:21:30.595 --> 02:21:36.196]  It looked like she was comparing some black women to apes, which is... Oh, I didn't see that!
[02:21:36.196 --> 02:21:37.396]  Yeah, I mean, I saw that on Twitter.
[02:21:37.396 --> 02:21:40.977]  I don't know if they were doctored or what, but in any event, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:40.977 --> 02:21:44.738]  Yes, the ABC can get rid of her for whatever reason they want.
[02:21:44.738 --> 02:21:46.098]  They don't like what speech she makes.
[02:21:46.098 --> 02:21:47.238]  They can do that.
[02:21:47.238 --> 02:21:49.499]  And yes, it is the same as the NFL.
[02:21:49.499 --> 02:21:54.140]  The NFL has every right to tell these players that they can't protest.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.680]  But I think in both situations,
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:59.981]  Just because they can doesn't necessarily mean they should.
[02:21:59.981 --> 02:22:03.963]  Free speech is a different thing than the First Amendment.
[02:22:03.963 --> 02:22:08.664]  The First Amendment protects your right to free speech from interference by the government.
[02:22:08.664 --> 02:22:10.705]  Free speech is larger than that.
[02:22:11.425 --> 02:22:17.090]  You know, as Americans, I think there ought to be a higher regard for freedom of expression.
[02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:18.892]  There should be more latitude for it.
[02:22:18.892 --> 02:22:31.804]  It shouldn't be a minefield that if Roseanne steps on it with a stupid tweet, that means the end of some show because this network has to be so clear to make sure that it signals to everybody how virtuous it is.
[02:22:31.804 --> 02:22:35.087]  You know, and just like on the opposite end of the political spectrum, the NFL,
[02:22:35.928 --> 02:22:43.070]  Feels like it has to make this patriotic move, which I think is the least patriotic thing that the NFL could do.
[02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:50.812]  The NFL, to me, represents America about as much as Bruce Springsteen and big V8 engines.
[02:22:50.812 --> 02:23:04.996]  But then you've got them really just taking a dump on these players' free speech rights, and I think that there's enough room in the NFL and there's enough room on ABC to tolerate these players' speech, and there's enough room to tolerate Roseanne's speech, because what we have is this
[02:23:05.456 --> 02:23:07.758]  This narrowing of what is tolerable.
[02:23:22.085 --> 02:23:42.339]  You've got the government and the leftist and some big organizations working with Starbucks to have all this race training stuff and asking patrons of their races to create racial division and hysteria, and that this is the psychological control that some very wicked corporations are involved in, pushing this whole anti-free speech agenda.
[02:23:42.339 --> 02:23:50.964]  So I totally agree with you that it's ominous, it's dangerous, it's bad, but we have the proof of major think tanks and psych warfare groups we're going to break later today.
[02:23:50.964 --> 02:23:51.905]  As soon as the report's done,
[02:23:52.005 --> 02:23:54.006]  I know, guys.
[02:23:54.006 --> 02:23:56.686]  I mean, this is diabolical.
[02:23:56.686 --> 02:24:06.529]  Look, I don't know anything about any of that, but I can tell you that it is, to me, the amount of divisiveness that we seem to be trying to create.
[02:24:06.529 --> 02:24:11.711]  It's as if, you know, the two guys that got thrown out of Starbucks, it was wrong.
[02:24:11.711 --> 02:24:14.332]  I think what happened to them was bad.
[02:24:14.332 --> 02:24:16.472]  But they seem to have a lot of class about it.
[02:24:16.472 --> 02:24:18.553]  You know, they settled that case for one dollar.
[02:24:19.173 --> 02:24:21.575]  And I thought that sent the right message.
[02:24:21.575 --> 02:24:27.080]  You know, now Starbucks has this re-education camp here for everybody where they're shutting down for a whole day.
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.783]  Look, they're a private company, they can do that.
[02:24:29.783 --> 02:24:33.726]  Frankly though, I don't know that it's really constructive.
[02:24:33.726 --> 02:24:34.227]  But that's...
[02:24:34.827 --> 02:24:36.328]  That's the right way to put it.
[02:24:36.328 --> 02:24:39.269]  Starbucks is becoming a giant re-education camp.
[02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:40.049]  The schools are.
[02:24:40.049 --> 02:24:42.750]  This is a classic Soviet-style re-education camp.
[02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:44.631]  That's what the sensitivity training is.
[02:24:44.631 --> 02:24:48.413]  And it's funny you say that, because we have the documents we're putting together right now.
[02:24:48.413 --> 02:24:55.456]  I could have just brought it out on air, but they're doing a special report right now, where it's premeditated to create more division and create a cultural crisis.
[02:24:56.243 --> 02:24:58.444]  Well, look, if that's the case, it would make perfect sense.
[02:24:58.444 --> 02:25:07.768]  I mean, it's a good idea if you have people... If you're at the top of a pyramid, what you want is the people at the bottom of the pyramid fighting with each other over crumbs.
[02:25:07.768 --> 02:25:09.709]  So, it would make perfect sense.
[02:25:09.709 --> 02:25:19.093]  But, you know, back to the real free speech issue here is that we need a societal commitment to it, and that means we need more tolerance for it.
[02:25:19.693 --> 02:25:21.555]  Both from the right and the left.
[02:25:21.555 --> 02:25:28.120]  You know, it's like, we've seen a lot of it from the left recently, but I think we're seeing just as bad from the right.
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:34.705]  When you see people cheering this NFL policy, you know, these are the same people that we've relied on for the past few years.
[02:25:34.705 --> 02:25:35.786]  No, I thought that the other day.
[02:25:35.786 --> 02:25:44.493]  I mean, I agree they have the right to do it as a corporation, but I made the point, now we got the right wing coming in and attacking speech, and the left wing, but there'll be nothing left when they're done.
[02:25:44.893 --> 02:25:45.713]  And that's the problem.
[02:25:45.713 --> 02:26:00.318]  You know, we're all just dividing into tribes instead of having free speech being our tribe and then saying we can differ on policy, we can differ on race theories, we can differ on gender theories, we can... But see, how they segue it in is like saying video game makers are causing mass shootings.
[02:26:00.498 --> 02:26:00.978]  No.
[02:26:00.978 --> 02:26:09.183]  Some mentally ill people on Prozac-type drugs tend to be influenced by him, but that's like saying somebody runs somebody over with a truck because they're crazy, so it's the truck's fault.
[02:26:09.183 --> 02:26:13.386]  You know, with myself and others, the new thing is Jones sent someone into the pizzeria.
[02:26:13.386 --> 02:26:14.566]  Totally not true.
[02:26:14.566 --> 02:26:16.587]  Then they say someone killed someone in the pizzeria.
[02:26:16.587 --> 02:26:24.092]  Then they say Jones sent some woman that, by the way, doesn't even like me, and some guy to some woman's door in Connecticut to be mean to people saying their kids didn't die.
[02:26:24.352 --> 02:26:26.214]  When I never said that, never named those people.
[02:26:26.214 --> 02:26:40.445]  So the way they're extending to get free speech is claiming that it's causing violence like fire in a theater, and then they extend it further, claiming that then it's this distress that I'm putting them under because of what crazy people did that I have no connection to.
[02:26:40.745 --> 02:26:48.808]  Yeah, look, there's always been this argument, you know, back to the 50s when people tried to claim comic books were causing kids to be mentally ill.
[02:26:48.808 --> 02:26:58.092]  You know, when I was a kid, it was, they were saying that Ozzy Osbourne was causing it, or, you know, that heavy metal music was causing it, or kids playing Dungeons and Dragons.
[02:26:58.092 --> 02:26:59.173]  And, you know, now it's...
[02:26:59.793 --> 02:27:13.861]  Now it's racist speech, or now it's extremist speech of some kind, you know, and they'll define that in the ever-expanding definition of racism or extremist, which will fit just pretty much anything that they want to suppress.
[02:27:13.861 --> 02:27:16.923]  At the end of the day, you got to look at these arguments for what they are.
[02:27:16.923 --> 02:27:19.985]  It's the same warmed-over garbage, you know, when they said that
[02:27:20.405 --> 02:27:29.610]  Pornography was causing rape, for example, and then the science showed that, you know, in Denmark, when pornography became legalized, it dropped the sexual assault rate.
[02:27:29.610 --> 02:27:30.691]  Uh-oh, what now?
[02:27:30.691 --> 02:27:36.134]  You know, you have this constant assault on what is easy to get rid of.
[02:27:36.134 --> 02:27:42.217]  You know, it makes it really easy when you can point at some content and say, I don't like that content, and I think that's causing it.
[02:27:42.217 --> 02:27:44.659]  Exactly, and then they set the precedent.
[02:27:44.659 --> 02:27:46.360]  They first build a straw man of who I am.
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:51.862]  And you can take stuff out of context, and then they demonize that, and we looked it up.
[02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:55.743]  You know how many articles they've put out the last two years on me on Sandy Hook?
[02:27:55.743 --> 02:27:56.363]  I do not.
[02:27:56.363 --> 02:27:58.264]  It's in the hundreds of thousands.
[02:27:58.264 --> 02:28:00.625]  Because they'll put one out and it's syndicated everywhere, it's on every TV.
[02:28:00.625 --> 02:28:03.866]  I mean, this is like propaganda you put out before you invade a country.
[02:28:03.866 --> 02:28:04.346]  Sure.
[02:28:04.346 --> 02:28:11.568]  So, and now they admit in the Wall Street Journal, the plan is, when they take me down to WikiLeaks, they are planning, they said, to end the free web as they know it.
[02:28:11.568 --> 02:28:12.749]  This is public!
[02:28:12.749 --> 02:28:13.469]  I can show you the article!
[02:28:13.629 --> 02:28:20.093]  I mean, you're one of the few media personalities who isn't beholden to one of these large companies.
[02:28:20.093 --> 02:28:23.175]  So, you know, I could see why that would be troubling to them.
[02:28:23.175 --> 02:28:29.699]  I mean, I can see why some people might not like your views, but what's wrong with letting them be out there and combating them with your own?
[02:28:29.699 --> 02:28:33.982]  I mean, you know, they had Air America, you know, it didn't work out that well.
[02:28:33.982 --> 02:28:36.484]  I mean, people just didn't want to listen to it.
[02:28:36.484 --> 02:28:41.267]  Sorry, you know, when sometimes there's ideas out there that I like, but the marketplace rejects them.
[02:28:41.827 --> 02:28:45.473]  I have to just sit back and look at it like a game where my team didn't... That's right.
[02:28:45.473 --> 02:28:48.618]  Stay right there, Mr. Randazzo, our great First Amendment lawyer.
[02:28:48.618 --> 02:28:53.026]  When we come back, though, more on Roseanne, because I guess some of these are insensitive tweets.
[02:28:53.026 --> 02:28:53.647]  I hadn't read them all.
[02:28:53.647 --> 02:28:54.168]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.799 --> 02:28:56.619]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.619 --> 02:28:58.400]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:00.041]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:29:00.041 --> 02:29:02.882]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:29:02.882 --> 02:29:05.162]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:29:05.162 --> 02:29:09.664]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:29:09.664 --> 02:29:13.605]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:29:13.605 --> 02:29:17.387]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:29:17.387 --> 02:29:17.707]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:29:17.707 --> 02:29:19.447]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:29:24.972 --> 02:29:27.213]  You have been lied to.
[02:29:27.213 --> 02:29:28.934]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[02:29:28.934 --> 02:29:31.636]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:29:31.636 --> 02:29:36.959]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:29:36.959 --> 02:29:42.642]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:29:42.642 --> 02:29:46.084]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[02:29:46.084 --> 02:29:49.205]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[02:29:56.184 --> 02:29:59.787]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:29:59.787 --> 02:30:01.549]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:01.549 --> 02:30:12.838]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.599 --> 02:30:22.784]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:22.784 --> 02:30:28.747]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:28.747 --> 02:30:33.849]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:33.849 --> 02:30:36.471]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:30:36.471 --> 02:30:38.191]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:38.191 --> 02:30:42.994]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[02:30:43.234 --> 02:30:48.179]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[02:32:02.161 --> 02:32:05.383]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:32:05.383 --> 02:32:09.086]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:13.789]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:32:13.789 --> 02:32:17.031]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:32:17.931 --> 02:32:28.942]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:32:28.942 --> 02:32:37.470]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:40.832]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:09.182 --> 02:33:11.823]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:11.823 --> 02:33:27.425]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:27.425 --> 02:33:34.787]  Mark Rondazzo, one of the top First Amendment lawyers, here in the studio with us getting into the, what would you call it, all-out, systematic, corporate,
[02:33:36.075 --> 02:33:46.525]  University, private assault on free speech, where we're being inducted into this neurotic, politically correct, virtue-signaling hellhole.
[02:33:46.525 --> 02:33:51.730]  And then you read the WikiLeaks, I don't know if you've seen these, but it talks about, we need more culture war to keep control of the masses.
[02:33:51.730 --> 02:33:57.275]  What you said earlier about the pyramid, and it makes sense that that's what they've always done in other third world countries and in ancient feudal
[02:33:58.035 --> 02:33:59.457]  Well, every society.
[02:33:59.457 --> 02:34:01.438]  And it is a cultural issue.
[02:34:01.438 --> 02:34:02.679]  It's not just a legal issue.
[02:34:02.679 --> 02:34:04.320]  It's not just the corporations.
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:13.007]  It needs to be those of us that are just regular people have got to start reaffirming a commitment to freedom of expression or we're going to lose it.
[02:34:13.007 --> 02:34:16.770]  And you're going to turn around one day, you know, for example,
[02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:29.237]  You know, the ACLU championed hate speech laws for years, and now they are completely losing their mind because hate speech laws are being used now to protect police officers from hate speech.
[02:34:29.237 --> 02:34:30.377]  And it's like, surprise!
[02:34:30.377 --> 02:34:34.159]  You know, you thought that the cheetah wouldn't claw your face when you let it out of the cage?
[02:34:34.159 --> 02:34:35.520]  That's what happened.
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:39.963]  So we have this cultural problem, and yes, it's been bubbling up for years.
[02:34:39.963 --> 02:34:43.245]  I mean, I remember when I started college, I mean, I had a
[02:34:44.045 --> 02:34:52.450]  You know, I had a poster on my wall, on my door, on my dorm room, that had the Nazi swastika with the red circle around it with the line through it.
[02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:53.911]  It was for my Dead Kennedys album.
[02:34:53.911 --> 02:34:56.232]  I was kind of a punk rock kid back then.
[02:34:56.232 --> 02:34:58.114]  Still am, just changed my hair a bit.
[02:34:58.114 --> 02:35:02.236]  But, you know, I got written up for having an anti-Semitic display.
[02:35:02.236 --> 02:35:02.877]  I know!
[02:35:02.877 --> 02:35:03.457]  It's incredible!
[02:35:04.277 --> 02:35:04.878]  Exactly.
[02:35:04.878 --> 02:35:10.842]  And I said, do you not recognize the big red circle and the big red slash through it?
[02:35:10.842 --> 02:35:13.744]  That means the exact opposite of what you're charging.
[02:35:13.744 --> 02:35:19.027]  But the virtue signalers are so wanting to find it because it's their whole cosmology, their whole world.
[02:35:19.027 --> 02:35:27.033]  That's why they've reported like 99% of the dorm rooms, swastikas and all the rest of it are staged, self-inflicted for attention.
[02:35:27.033 --> 02:35:28.414]  Yeah, I mean there have been.
[02:35:28.414 --> 02:35:30.175]  They can't hardly find real ones.
[02:35:30.515 --> 02:35:39.998]  No, I mean, we have a mutual friend, Mike Cernovich, who's putting out a film right now called Hoaxed, which has documented hundreds of cases of this.
[02:35:39.998 --> 02:35:45.800]  You know, it's as if, you know, there is this, if something like this does happen to you, it's terrible.
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:49.601]  Um, and it immediately gives you a platform.
[02:35:49.601 --> 02:35:51.962]  It immediately gives you some moral authority.
[02:35:51.962 --> 02:36:01.285]  So it's not surprising that there is an allure to somebody hoaxing themselves in a, you know, hoaxing everybody that they've been involved in an incident like this.
[02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:03.526]  Well, that's like the statistics show in the U.S.
[02:36:03.526 --> 02:36:05.727]  about half of rape claims are completely fake.
[02:36:06.007 --> 02:36:08.049]  There are real rape going on, it's terrible.
[02:36:08.049 --> 02:36:10.531]  I've got three daughters, somebody rapes one of my daughters, they're dead.
[02:36:10.531 --> 02:36:32.650]  I'm not saying rape doesn't happen, but then take Morgan Freeman, he's talking about suing CNN, because they admit this was women, he's hitting on them, it's a little creepy, a couple times, a little over the top, but at the same time, the women are laughing and everything, that's not harassment, that's not assault, that's not women on TV shaking their heads and losing endorsements, it's just piling on, and then that takes away
[02:36:33.351 --> 02:36:37.974]  From Harvey Weinstein and you know the clear evidence that where there's smoke there's fire.
[02:36:37.974 --> 02:36:41.997]  It looks like hundreds of women and it's really serious stuff.
[02:36:41.997 --> 02:36:44.539]  Have you seen that video of Morgan Freeman?
[02:36:44.539 --> 02:36:51.563]  I mean he's sitting there next to I think it's Michael Caine who says to a woman who was six months pregnant.
[02:36:51.563 --> 02:37:00.989]  I'm sorry I wasn't I didn't congratulate you because I one time I congratulated a woman on being six months pregnant and she wasn't and oh boy was I embarrassed I'll never do that again.
[02:37:00.989 --> 02:37:03.111]  And Morgan Freeman says I wish I was there.
[02:37:03.291 --> 02:37:04.172]  Because it'd be funny.
[02:37:04.172 --> 02:37:04.492]  Right.
[02:37:04.492 --> 02:37:06.533]  He's not talking about being there when she was pregnant.
[02:37:06.533 --> 02:37:28.648]  No, I mean, I don't see how anybody could interpret it that way, but this woman was so desperate to be offended, because, you know, offense and victimization is the coin of the realm now, so... Even though it doesn't really do anything for most people, and then once they do it, once they file the fake EEOC complaint, once they do that, then they don't get hired because they blackballed themselves, not the other people.
[02:37:28.648 --> 02:37:29.649]  They don't understand it.
[02:37:30.754 --> 02:37:32.055]  I mean, I don't know... Yeah, back this up.
[02:37:32.055 --> 02:37:34.417]  We're going to play the evil offensive clip in a minute.
[02:37:34.417 --> 02:37:38.720]  This is them talking about going in style, and then the women all sit up there all angry.
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:40.181]  We're CNN.
[02:37:40.181 --> 02:37:48.588]  They might have one report every six months about thousands of women sold into sex slavery every month out of sub-Saharan Africa by Arab slave traders in cages.
[02:37:48.588 --> 02:37:56.914]  The Arab slave trade is back, and there is zero coverage in the New York Times, Washington Post, but then there's women shaking their heads about Morgan Freedman.
[02:37:56.914 --> 02:37:57.695]  Here, let's play the clip.
[02:37:58.522 --> 02:38:02.764]  One time I congratulated a woman on being pregnant and she wasn't.
[02:38:02.764 --> 02:38:04.825]  And so I've never done it again.
[02:38:04.825 --> 02:38:06.385]  For 50 years I've never done it.
[02:38:06.385 --> 02:38:07.266]  You've learned your lesson.
[02:38:07.266 --> 02:38:09.187]  I learned my lesson.
[02:38:09.187 --> 02:38:10.627]  Lord, I wish I was there.
[02:38:10.627 --> 02:38:12.188]  This movie is...
[02:38:14.818 --> 02:38:17.620]  And the women look like they've seen the ultimate criminal here.
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:20.882]  Well, my favorite part of that clip is actually when you show the two women.
[02:38:20.882 --> 02:38:28.606]  I mean, I don't know if I'm just interpreting the woman on the left's view, but the woman on the left here seems to be looking at her co-host.
[02:38:28.606 --> 02:38:31.387]  She looks at her at one point like, this is what you brought me on for?
[02:38:31.387 --> 02:38:33.649]  I don't know.
[02:38:33.649 --> 02:38:37.891]  That look to me right there, if I can read her, she's like, you've got to be kidding me.
[02:38:37.891 --> 02:38:39.012]  How do I keep a straight face?
[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:45.786]  Although, who knows, maybe she's sitting there saying, me too, sister, but... It's just, it's just, there are...
[02:38:47.148 --> 02:38:50.591]  Close to a million people killed in the Arab Spring that Hillary and Obama funded.
[02:38:50.591 --> 02:39:01.360]  They took out moderate people who made deals with us, who they betrayed in deals, and then murdered them, and then under the Islamic caliphate idea, blacks aren't fully human.
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:09.287]  They're the ones who started the modern slave trade, and they are... I mean, even Al Jazeera admits tens of thousands of women a month are being sold in slave auctions.
[02:39:09.287 --> 02:39:10.608]  Almost no coverage!
[02:39:10.608 --> 02:39:12.570]  Where are these women shaking their heads about that?
[02:39:12.570 --> 02:39:13.591]  It really makes me mad, Mark.
[02:39:13.891 --> 02:39:20.878]  Well, you know, you might wind up in a politically incorrect quagmire if you start criticizing that.
[02:39:20.878 --> 02:39:24.562]  It's much easier to go pick somebody here like Morgan Freeman.
[02:39:24.562 --> 02:39:26.444]  I mean, why not pick on Harvey Weinstein?
[02:39:26.444 --> 02:39:29.447]  I mean, Harvey Weinstein, he's a bad guy.
[02:39:29.447 --> 02:39:36.694]  What his own driver and his own valet and his own assistant said, I think they're all probably have some culpability, oh yeah, he would pin women
[02:39:37.335 --> 02:39:37.816]  I don't know.
[02:39:54.463 --> 02:39:58.746]  And then reportedly this is what he would do is he would pin them and then do that begging.
[02:39:58.746 --> 02:40:00.347]  You've heard the tapes, like, come on.
[02:40:00.347 --> 02:40:01.027]  It's okay.
[02:40:01.027 --> 02:40:01.468]  It's okay.
[02:40:01.468 --> 02:40:01.908]  All right.
[02:40:01.908 --> 02:40:05.710]  And then he started smothering them and then they would just finally be smothered.
[02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:08.252]  And then he would like cover their mouth up and go, no, no, no, no.
[02:40:08.252 --> 02:40:09.153]  And the thought they would just let it.
[02:40:09.793 --> 02:40:11.934]  I just don't understand what the fun of that is.
[02:40:11.934 --> 02:40:13.335]  It doesn't sound very fun.
[02:40:13.335 --> 02:40:17.438]  No, man, the fun of having sex is the woman is convincing her to do it with you.
[02:40:17.438 --> 02:40:18.238]  She wants to do it with you.
[02:40:18.238 --> 02:40:19.960]  Well, the fun is them ripping your clothes off.
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:20.940]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:25.703]  I mean, I don't know if that's this kind of show, but yes, that's the more fun way to do it.
[02:40:25.703 --> 02:40:28.965]  Well, no, I mean, I'm just not... Yeah, it's a family show at the same time.
[02:40:28.965 --> 02:40:30.006]  That's natural.
[02:40:30.006 --> 02:40:30.907]  Men and women.
[02:40:30.907 --> 02:40:31.927]  It's like James Constant.
[02:40:31.927 --> 02:40:32.968]  I played the clip last week when you were on.
[02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:35.590]  They're like, ask about Morgan Freeman.
[02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:37.811]  He's like, isn't that what men and women have done since the beginning of time?
[02:40:37.811 --> 02:40:38.711]  That's what mammals do.
[02:40:38.711 --> 02:40:39.731]  You know, they get together.
[02:40:39.731 --> 02:40:45.514]  It's this feminist, radical idea that a man and woman, even initiating like, hey, you look good, let's do something.
[02:40:45.514 --> 02:40:48.315]  Let's go out to dinner, that that somehow tantamount to rape.
[02:40:48.315 --> 02:40:49.516]  No, it's not tantamount to rape.
[02:40:49.516 --> 02:40:55.958]  And it's Hollywood where they abuse women more than any other group out there in my reading, in my research, that is the ones pushing men against women.
[02:40:55.958 --> 02:40:56.739]  What do you think's behind that?
[02:40:57.989 --> 02:41:07.447]  I heard a really good comedian, I wish I could remember her name, but she said, you want to know how to keep from getting accused of sexual harassment?
[02:41:07.447 --> 02:41:08.489]  She said, be hot.
[02:41:10.015 --> 02:41:16.580]  I mean, I, you know, look, if Harvey Weinstein was Brad Pitt, I wonder how that all would have gone down.
[02:41:16.580 --> 02:41:24.925]  So, you know, I just think that this is like a, it's a hysteria that, unfortunately, there is fire, okay?
[02:41:24.925 --> 02:41:27.067]  It's not like where there's smoke, there's fire, and there isn't.
[02:41:27.067 --> 02:41:28.408]  But they keep equating rape!
[02:41:28.968 --> 02:41:29.849]  Yes.
[02:41:29.849 --> 02:41:34.213]  And really evil stuff like Bill Cosby ended up clearly doing.
[02:41:34.213 --> 02:41:39.458]  And Morgan Freeman did ads saying Trump's a secret communist, remove him from office.
[02:41:39.458 --> 02:41:41.160]  Morgan Freeman's a sellout.
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:42.321]  He's in way too many movies.
[02:41:42.321 --> 02:41:43.122]  I used to like him.
[02:41:43.122 --> 02:41:43.622]  I'm sick of him.
[02:41:43.622 --> 02:41:46.565]  When I see him in a movie now, I'm like, God, it's the same.
[02:41:46.565 --> 02:41:48.086]  He plays God in every show.
[02:41:48.086 --> 02:41:49.187]  I like him.
[02:41:49.187 --> 02:41:51.269]  I get a kick out of it if God looks like Morgan Freeman.
[02:41:52.330 --> 02:41:54.551]  No, but I think he's over-saturated.
[02:41:54.551 --> 02:42:18.800]  It pretty much diminishes what the women went through under Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein to then kind of pull in a guy like Morgan Freeman who, say what you will about his views, say what you will about his acting, say what you will about his face, but I happen to be a fan of his, but there's nothing I've seen that he's done that warrants even the slightest bit of criticism.
[02:42:19.687 --> 02:42:38.305]  I mean, if anything, he's, you know, he's certainly as far left as you can get, but they always want to eat their own, because there's this, you know, there's this allure in any movement, you know, when you can be cruel to somebody and you can beat on somebody, but do it from a position of virtue.
[02:42:38.305 --> 02:42:39.586]  That is so alluring.
[02:42:39.586 --> 02:42:40.927]  Absolutely, I totally agree with you.
[02:42:40.927 --> 02:42:42.468]  You know, Huxley wrote about that.
[02:42:43.450 --> 02:42:45.993]  I'm gonna say this though about Valerie Jarrett.
[02:42:45.993 --> 02:42:47.695]  It's not because she's part black or whatever.
[02:42:47.695 --> 02:42:51.240]  I think she looks like a snapping turtle on PCP.
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:54.024]  A demonic snapping turtle meets a grey alien.
[02:42:55.438 --> 02:42:59.120]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:07.125]  Between debt crises, natural disasters, or even simple power outages, having a supply of storable meals is crucial.

[02:44:56.115 --> 02:45:03.743]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:45:03.743 --> 02:45:11.672]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:45:11.672 --> 02:45:14.756]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:45:15.376 --> 02:45:20.041]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:45:20.041 --> 02:45:24.166]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:45:24.166 --> 02:45:27.309]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:45:27.309 --> 02:45:32.094]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:45:32.094 --> 02:45:35.118]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:45:35.538 --> 02:45:50.616]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:45:50.616 --> 02:45:52.157]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:45:52.157 --> 02:45:54.480]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:45:56.226 --> 02:46:01.811]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in 4's life.
[02:46:01.811 --> 02:46:02.672]  It'd take hours.
[02:46:02.672 --> 02:46:05.114]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:46:05.114 --> 02:46:06.295]  It's stronger.
[02:46:06.295 --> 02:46:07.897]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:46:07.897 --> 02:46:11.120]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:12.241]  It's back in stock.
[02:46:12.241 --> 02:46:15.424]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:15.424 --> 02:46:18.747]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:46:19.247 --> 02:46:19.407]  I think?
[02:46:35.839 --> 02:46:38.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:32.171]  It's time.
[02:47:36.641 --> 02:47:38.922]  Mark Rondazza of rondazza.com is here.
[02:47:38.922 --> 02:47:40.822]  He's got nationwide legal First Amendment.
[02:47:40.822 --> 02:47:55.247]  And boy, like you said, when you went to Georgetown, the very university suing me with the made-up stuff out of what happened and the whole crisis and the death that happened last year and all the things that went on in Charlottesville.
[02:47:55.247 --> 02:47:57.128]  And you're saying, but now you are in real demand.
[02:47:57.128 --> 02:48:00.729]  That little obscure area you got into, there was no need to defend it.
[02:48:00.729 --> 02:48:01.889]  It wasn't under attack.
[02:48:01.889 --> 02:48:04.550]  Now you've definitely hit pay dirt.
[02:48:04.850 --> 02:48:15.835]  Well, there's always been a reason to have First Amendment lawyers, yes, but there were, I think when I first started doing it, there was a lot of questions, like people would say, well what kind of lawyer are you?
[02:48:15.835 --> 02:48:18.917]  I'd say a First Amendment lawyer, and then I'd have to explain what that meant.
[02:48:18.917 --> 02:48:20.958]  I don't have to explain what that means so much anymore.
[02:48:20.958 --> 02:48:32.043]  Which, you know, in some ways that makes me happy, that there's a little more awareness of what the First Amendment is, but unfortunately there seems to be a, you know, less of a commitment to it.
[02:48:32.563 --> 02:48:47.736]  You know, at one time, and I say just in sort of a, you know, there's that Zen story about the guy, you know, the general who gets a horse and gives it to his son and then his son breaks his leg, you know, it's in a couple movies where it's every single piece of the story.
[02:48:47.736 --> 02:48:48.657]  Charlie Wilson's war.
[02:48:48.657 --> 02:48:49.317]  That's it, yeah.
[02:48:49.317 --> 02:48:51.499]  It sounds like it's a good thing that happens.
[02:48:51.499 --> 02:48:52.981]  You see the different angles.
[02:48:52.981 --> 02:48:53.401]  Right.
[02:48:53.401 --> 02:48:54.382]  Multidimensional chess.
[02:48:54.642 --> 02:49:14.198]  Right, and I remember when the Soviet Union fell and Eastern Europe became free, it looked like it was a great thing, and now we look back and I think maybe, at least in America, I'm not sure, because there was always this thing that we could point across the Atlantic and say, over that wall, that's what we don't want to be.
[02:49:14.198 --> 02:49:20.343]  And now over here, it seems like we don't have the government so much shoving it down our throats as we are just
[02:49:21.124 --> 02:49:22.245]  Screaming for it.
[02:49:22.245 --> 02:49:23.907]  We are begging for reform.
[02:49:23.907 --> 02:49:28.312]  Corporatism, globalism is megacorporations acting as government.
[02:49:28.312 --> 02:49:30.414]  And bigger than government, more powerful than government.
[02:49:30.414 --> 02:49:36.080]  I mean, look, if you tried to rein in Twitter and Facebook's censorship, which
[02:49:36.681 --> 02:49:41.063]  You know, they are allowed to do what they're doing under the First Amendment, at least for now.
[02:49:41.063 --> 02:49:46.405]  I mean, I'm hoping that there are some legal theories that percolate, that somehow reign them in.
[02:49:46.405 --> 02:49:50.806]  But, you know, I recognize that the weight of the authority right now says they can do that.
[02:49:50.806 --> 02:49:52.807]  Let me break this down.
[02:49:52.807 --> 02:49:56.208]  I know this is organized because I've read what the IMF and World Bank have said.
[02:49:56.208 --> 02:49:57.228]  I've seen the WikiLeaks.
[02:49:57.228 --> 02:49:59.089]  I've seen what Zuckerberg says on Hot Mikes.
[02:49:59.089 --> 02:50:00.069]  Matt Drudge came here.
[02:50:00.069 --> 02:50:01.210]  He's only done one interview since.
[02:50:02.449 --> 02:50:04.390]  About two and a half years ago.
[02:50:04.390 --> 02:50:05.631]  No, about two years ago.
[02:50:05.631 --> 02:50:08.193]  And he stood right there because he didn't want to be on camera.
[02:50:08.193 --> 02:50:10.174]  Because of the repercussions of people attacking him.
[02:50:10.174 --> 02:50:13.156]  And he said, I met with the Supreme Court Justice a month ago.
[02:50:13.156 --> 02:50:16.098]  The other conservative is still alive that was on the court then.
[02:50:16.098 --> 02:50:18.380]  And he said, I've been briefed.
[02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:19.901]  There is a U.N.
[02:50:19.901 --> 02:50:27.566]  Soros plan and the Congress is going along with it, both parties, because even Republican media like Wall Street Journal doesn't like competition.
[02:50:27.566 --> 02:50:29.948]  News Corp behind the scenes is going along with all this.
[02:50:30.228 --> 02:50:35.622]  I like Sean Hannity, I like Tucker Carlson, but they're not the guys running News Corp.
[02:50:35.622 --> 02:50:37.506]  The new Fox is going to be even worse.
[02:50:38.447 --> 02:50:43.491]  It's going to be only sports and media as they split off from Disney, and they're coming after it.
[02:50:43.491 --> 02:50:48.515]  And in those meetings, they told the Supreme Court Justice, you just have to go along with this.
[02:50:48.515 --> 02:50:49.215]  It's global.
[02:50:49.215 --> 02:50:50.736]  You better sign on.
[02:50:50.736 --> 02:50:53.398]  And the Supreme Court Justice said, no, I won't.
[02:50:53.398 --> 02:50:57.281]  But just because Trump got in, they're still going ahead with the plan, bro.
[02:50:57.281 --> 02:51:06.268]  And so this is organized to come in and take somebody like me, set me up as the demon, lie about what I've done, destroy me, and set the precedent.
[02:51:06.268 --> 02:51:07.629]  So I'm not building myself up.
[02:51:08.829 --> 02:51:16.411]  I'm not that important or powerful to have over 100,000 articles about me just on the Sandy Hook misrepresenting what I said or did.
[02:51:16.411 --> 02:51:19.932]  But they admit this is the case to destroy the First Amendment.
[02:51:19.932 --> 02:51:26.993]  And that's why they fired all the other torpedoes and lied and said in Charlottesville that I said some guy I never heard of killed a woman.
[02:51:26.993 --> 02:51:27.554]  I didn't say that.
[02:51:27.554 --> 02:51:33.375]  I said Soros funding the demonstrators, the police standing down, contributed to the atmosphere that got that woman killed.
[02:51:33.775 --> 02:51:34.656]  They don't care.
[02:51:34.656 --> 02:51:35.957]  Georgetown is funding it.
[02:51:35.957 --> 02:51:38.300]  They're coming for me because it's organized.
[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:40.402]  So how do we face something like that?
[02:51:40.402 --> 02:51:45.767]  Have you ever had a client where they had 100,000 articles to destroy them on one subject?
[02:51:45.767 --> 02:51:46.968]  Never had a client with 100,000 articles.
[02:51:46.968 --> 02:51:47.009]  100,000?
[02:51:47.009 --> 02:51:47.129]  No.
[02:51:47.129 --> 02:51:47.529]  I can show you. 100,000.
[02:51:51.015 --> 02:51:51.295]  Sure.
[02:51:51.295 --> 02:51:53.257]  But, you know, the problem... Or more!
[02:51:53.257 --> 02:51:53.698]  Or more!
[02:51:53.698 --> 02:52:02.847]  I think what you're maybe pointing at, or maybe it's tangential to it, is that the traditional media used to be the standard-bearer for the First Amendment.
[02:52:02.847 --> 02:52:11.957]  You know, we depended on organizations like the Washington Post and the AP and the New York Times to take these fights all the way.
[02:52:11.957 --> 02:52:13.158]  You know, if you see
[02:52:13.899 --> 02:52:23.449]  You know, you read about the Pentagon Papers case, and you think about what they did at that time, just how much they fought for our freedom at that time.
[02:52:23.449 --> 02:52:27.053]  The newspapers were really a proud soldier in that fight.
[02:52:27.053 --> 02:52:35.622]  And now, you know, I remember when my career first started, and I'd see cases go on, and I'd see traditional media come.
[02:52:36.242 --> 02:52:43.946]  And fight these cases, and they would make sure to fight them so narrowly, because this is when blogs were first starting to come up.
[02:52:43.946 --> 02:52:53.652]  The new media was first starting to come up, and I saw them carefully tailoring their legal arguments to make sure that that circle only encompassed their corporate interests.
[02:52:53.652 --> 02:52:55.473]  And it really annoyed me.
[02:52:55.473 --> 02:53:01.216]  And then I see, for example, Florida recently passed an anti-SLAPP law, finally.
[02:53:01.836 --> 02:53:07.458]  And it made sure to listen to corporate lobbyists that ensured that it didn't apply to the little people.
[02:53:07.458 --> 02:53:10.099]  It only applies to the big guys.
[02:53:10.099 --> 02:53:21.923]  I see cases like, you know, these open courts cases where, you know, I've got new media people like Mike that we talked, Mike Cernovich, we talked about before coming in and he's fighting to open the thing.
[02:53:21.923 --> 02:53:27.865]  And then the Miami Herald shows up, you know, 13, 14 months later and decides, well, here we are, Johnny, come lately.
[02:53:28.405 --> 02:53:34.870]  The problem is the mainstream media has fallen asleep at the switch, largely, I think, because of corporate ownership.
[02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:36.431]  It's no longer independent.
[02:53:36.431 --> 02:53:36.691]  I agree.
[02:53:36.691 --> 02:53:41.334]  It's no longer fighting to bring the news to us, and it's no longer fighting for the First Amendment.
[02:53:41.334 --> 02:53:42.796]  I agree, but the perfect storm
[02:53:43.596 --> 02:53:50.906]  Is that corporate media doesn't have the power, it's having layoffs, it's consolidating, it's falling apart.
[02:53:50.906 --> 02:53:52.287]  That's why they want to demonize me.
[02:53:52.287 --> 02:53:54.310]  They can't just put it out in the New York Times or something.
[02:53:54.310 --> 02:53:56.873]  They've got to syndicate it everywhere, over and over and over again.
[02:53:56.873 --> 02:54:01.620]  But their final power is still to all get together and just chirp the same lie.
[02:54:01.940 --> 02:54:10.845]  For long enough, and then they can still get a new war, they can still get a scam like Obamacare through, they can still defraud people when they all work together.
[02:54:10.845 --> 02:54:13.407]  The problem is even that power is dissipating.
[02:54:13.407 --> 02:54:26.115]  And so you have corporate media, Republican bluebloods, Democrat establishment, multinational corporations, Communist Chinese coming to Davos last year and saying, don't worry, we'll defeat the rebellion of Europe against the EU.
[02:54:27.105 --> 02:54:28.045]  Unelected EU.
[02:54:28.045 --> 02:54:30.767]  We will defeat Trump and his populist movement.
[02:54:30.767 --> 02:54:32.908]  Look at NewsWars.com.
[02:54:32.908 --> 02:54:33.908]  Brand new article.
[02:54:33.908 --> 02:54:37.950]  Soros unveils plan to save the EU.
[02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:38.770]  And it goes through.
[02:54:38.770 --> 02:54:40.831]  Oh, a big global Marshall Plan.
[02:54:40.831 --> 02:54:44.392]  And how to go into the countries and stop them from kicking them out.
[02:54:44.392 --> 02:54:47.754]  And how to flood them with even more refugees.
[02:54:49.079 --> 02:54:50.660]  On and on and on and on and on.
[02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:53.762]  This is unbelievable tyranny at NewsWars.com.
[02:54:53.762 --> 02:54:56.063]  Very powerful article that everybody needs to get out.
[02:54:56.063 --> 02:54:56.924]  But that's what we're dealing with.
[02:54:56.924 --> 02:55:06.810]  When we come back in a moment for another five minutes before David Knight comes in loaded for bear, we have who was behind the whole Starbucks situation and a quick special report on that.
[02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:09.391]  That one of our reporters put together.
[02:55:09.391 --> 02:55:11.331]  But this is shocking stuff.
[02:55:11.331 --> 02:55:12.471]  Again, we have Mark Randazza.
[02:55:12.471 --> 02:55:14.292]  Randazza.com.
[02:55:14.292 --> 02:55:16.712]  R-A-N-D-A-Z-Z-A dot com.
[02:55:16.712 --> 02:55:18.693]  You've got offices in how many cities?
[02:55:18.693 --> 02:55:26.734]  We've got Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, California, and Las Vegas.
[02:55:26.734 --> 02:55:28.855]  And you're busy nowadays?
[02:55:28.855 --> 02:55:30.155]  I am quite busy, yeah.
[02:55:30.155 --> 02:55:33.036]  I'm on airplanes pretty much a couple days a week.
[02:55:34.107 --> 02:55:41.076]  Well I gotta tell ya, we are up against very tumultuous times and when this is all said and done and the dust settles, history will be here.
[02:55:41.076 --> 02:55:42.778]  Ride shotgun with me for one more segment.
[02:55:42.778 --> 02:55:42.978]  Sure.
[02:55:42.978 --> 02:55:48.305]  David Knight's coming and we can have that meeting where we can talk about some stuff with Balin and some other people.
[02:55:48.305 --> 02:55:51.228]  Before we go any further, listen.
[02:55:51.228 --> 02:55:51.629]  It's simple.
[02:55:52.867 --> 02:55:58.574]  They made us stronger by going after our sponsors, and six, seven years ago, stripping most of them.
[02:55:58.574 --> 02:56:00.857]  And I said, you know, I know what high-quality products are.
[02:56:00.857 --> 02:56:04.903]  I already sell my own books, my own films, my own t-shirts, my own coffee cups.
[02:56:04.903 --> 02:56:07.106]  I said, and shortwave radios and cool stuff.
[02:56:08.345 --> 02:56:14.129]  I said I'll just go out with the top firms in the country and I'll put out some of the best supplements out there and then slash the prices.
[02:56:14.129 --> 02:56:17.272]  I'll just go out and sell the very best water filtration and air filtration.
[02:56:17.272 --> 02:56:19.353]  I'll just go out and sell the highest quality storable foods.
[02:56:19.353 --> 02:56:20.774]  I'll just do it all myself.
[02:56:20.774 --> 02:56:22.716]  And we've expanded InfoWars in the face of that.
[02:56:22.716 --> 02:56:31.823]  And they hate this model because if it picks up other places in the independent media, whether you be liberal, conservative, Christian, whatever it is, this is what works.
[02:56:32.583 --> 02:56:48.813]  And it's selling good products at really great prices to the listeners where they like them and they buy them again and then you're self-sufficient and now the big corporations can't control you with the ad apocalypse and all the bullying and now they're taking the liberals advertising on YouTube.
[02:56:48.813 --> 02:56:51.695]  The answer is direct sales and we've got free shipping.
[02:56:52.956 --> 02:56:53.336]  All right.
[02:57:09.543 --> 02:57:11.123]  Try Vitamin Refusion.
[02:57:11.123 --> 02:57:12.604]  Try these products.
[02:57:12.604 --> 02:57:13.764]  Try our great probiotic.
[02:57:13.764 --> 02:57:15.124]  Went out to the top lab in the country.
[02:57:15.124 --> 02:57:18.185]  I said, I want the strongest, best, wide-spectrum probiotic out there.
[02:57:18.185 --> 02:57:19.105]  We've got it.
[02:57:19.105 --> 02:57:21.166]  And when you purchase it, it funds our operation.
[02:57:21.166 --> 02:57:22.466]  A true 360 win.
[02:57:22.466 --> 02:57:24.447]  So thank you for being supporters.
[02:57:24.447 --> 02:57:26.727]  You are the sponsors of InfoWars.
[02:57:26.727 --> 02:57:28.788]  And thank those of you out there that continue to sign up.
[02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:35.334]  For auto ship because then you get an additional 10% off of those orders and that makes some of these deals lost leaders.
[02:57:35.334 --> 02:57:37.515]  Alright, fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:57:37.515 --> 02:57:43.941]  Find out who's behind the whole Starbucks beat yourself in the head with a frying pan movement straight ahead.
[02:57:46.118 --> 02:57:50.683]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:50.683 --> 02:57:51.264]  Thanks for calling.
[02:57:51.264 --> 02:57:52.325]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:57:52.325 --> 02:57:56.310]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:57:56.310 --> 02:58:05.040]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:21.336]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[02:58:21.836 --> 02:58:30.424]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:58:30.424 --> 02:58:35.329]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:58:35.329 --> 02:58:40.934]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:58:46.547 --> 02:58:53.476]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[02:58:53.476 --> 02:59:02.288]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.
[02:59:03.229 --> 02:59:17.234]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.
[02:59:17.234 --> 02:59:26.397]  Help support the information war, get great products at the same time, and continue to fund an operation that is a thorn in the side of the globalists and is continuing to back President Trump
[02:59:27.037 --> 02:59:28.478]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:56.073 --> 02:59:57.554]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[02:59:57.554 --> 02:59:58.374]  Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.374 --> 02:59:59.054]  Alex Jones.
[02:59:59.054 --> 02:59:59.755]  Alex Jones.
[02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:02.956]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.956 --> 03:00:12.439]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:00:12.439 --> 03:00:14.300]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:00:14.300 --> 03:00:18.301]  It sounds like it confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[03:00:19.683 --> 03:00:24.288]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[03:00:24.288 --> 03:00:26.951]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[03:00:26.951 --> 03:00:29.934]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[03:00:29.934 --> 03:00:31.295]  It's just pancakes.
[03:00:31.295 --> 03:00:36.020]  They took the babies out of incubators, and left the children to die on the front lines.
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:38.802]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[03:00:38.802 --> 03:00:42.546]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[03:00:42.546 --> 03:00:48.631]  Folks, David Knight and others are coming in in the next hour.
[03:00:48.631 --> 03:00:55.478]  Then there's the War Room with Owen Schroer, Roger Stone, Mark Rondazza of rondazza.com, great First Amendment lawyer, is here with us.
[03:00:55.478 --> 03:00:58.560]  I wanted to do one more big piece of news here.
[03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:05.847]  And that Starbucks racial bias training will be costly, but could pay off in the long run.
[03:01:05.847 --> 03:01:12.854]  Now, why did they do this when it tanked their stock last year, asking white people they were racist when you came in to get a coffee?
[03:01:12.854 --> 03:01:14.276]  It's bizarre.
[03:01:14.276 --> 03:01:15.156]  Why did they do this?
[03:01:15.156 --> 03:01:17.659]  Because it's part of creating hysteria.
[03:01:17.659 --> 03:01:18.420]  It's part of turning.
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:21.983]  The general country into what universities already are.
[03:01:21.983 --> 03:01:27.928]  It is turning the country, as Ron Dazza said earlier, into a giant re-education camp in their own words.
[03:01:27.928 --> 03:01:35.555]  But the Perception Institute, research, representation, reality, making reality.
[03:01:35.555 --> 03:01:39.458]  What do they say here in the article?
[03:01:39.458 --> 03:01:41.700]  Who do they say on their own website they're funded by?
[03:01:42.645 --> 03:01:45.888]  By the Open Society Foundation, that's George Soros.
[03:01:45.888 --> 03:01:48.510]  By the Ford Foundation, that's Liberation Theology.
[03:01:48.510 --> 03:02:01.100]  And all these same groups, the California Endowment, are trying to create this division and this control, because at the top of the pyramid, they want us fighting, as Randazza said earlier, down lower in the pyramid.
[03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:05.923]  So we're going to play this quick one-minute report, breaking it down, and then get Mark Randazza's take on it.
[03:02:05.923 --> 03:02:06.284]  Here it is.
[03:02:07.261 --> 03:02:12.423]  I pray that Starbucks is closing up shop today to implement mandatory implicit bias training.
[03:02:12.423 --> 03:02:20.026]  The move will cost an estimated $12 million in lost revenue, and critics say that it amounts to no more than virtue signaling.
[03:02:20.026 --> 03:02:21.306]  What's worse?
[03:02:21.306 --> 03:02:25.748]  Experts claim that when you mandate this type of training, it actually does more harm than good.
[03:02:25.748 --> 03:02:30.110]  So why would Starbucks go through with such a controversial move when it's costly and ineffective?
[03:02:31.337 --> 03:02:38.433]  Meet the Perception Institute, a think tank with the goal of propping up intersectionality, which is at the cornerstone of the liberal thought plantation.
[03:02:39.318 --> 03:02:40.338]  Here's the kicker.
[03:02:40.338 --> 03:02:49.921]  The Perception Institute is supported by, you guessed it, the George Soros Open Society Foundation, as well as another globalist foundation, the Ford Foundation.
[03:02:49.921 --> 03:02:54.243]  Now that we're able to follow the money, we can see exactly how the story turns.
[03:02:54.243 --> 03:03:01.645]  The Perception Institute has partnered with Starbucks to set the precedent for other companies to mandate this type of training and make it a cultural norm.
[03:03:01.645 --> 03:03:08.227]  If this is something you're opposed to, try supporting a local coffee shop, where you can check out more reports like these at InfoWars.com.
[03:03:08.865 --> 03:03:10.545]  Matt Weber reporting.
[03:03:10.545 --> 03:03:11.926]  That's a quick report he fired out.
[03:03:11.926 --> 03:03:14.426]  Good job on the research on that, Matt Weber.
[03:03:14.426 --> 03:03:17.447]  Mark Randazza, I mean, it's just, it's always the same players.
[03:03:17.447 --> 03:03:20.887]  Look, first off, I'm from New England, so I go to Dunkin' Donuts anyway.
[03:03:20.887 --> 03:03:22.488]  If I can avoid Starbucks, I do.
[03:03:22.488 --> 03:03:24.308]  I don't like their coffee, I don't like the atmosphere.
[03:03:24.308 --> 03:03:33.530]  But, you know, when you look at something like this, you gotta think about it in terms of what is this corporation trying to tell society?
[03:03:35.271 --> 03:03:46.037]  They must have at some level some idea that either this is going to make them more money or it's going to steer things in a direction that they want.
[03:03:46.037 --> 03:03:49.740]  This article here says it's going to be costly but it may pay off in the end.
[03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:50.880]  I'm not really sure how.
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:52.241]  I haven't seen any part of this.
[03:03:52.241 --> 03:03:56.804]  The paying off is the global mission for the corporations all unified pushing this crap.
[03:03:56.804 --> 03:03:59.246]  They're getting rid of religion and the new religion is this.
[03:04:00.026 --> 03:04:00.406]  Perhaps.
[03:04:00.406 --> 03:04:02.928]  I'm sorry, I'm racist.
[03:04:02.928 --> 03:04:10.613]  Well, it's like, you know, it seems to me that today, look, I think fighting racism is a normal, excuse me, a noble cause.
[03:04:10.613 --> 03:04:17.097]  But it seems to me that it is becoming what communism was in the 50s during the Red Scare.
[03:04:17.097 --> 03:04:21.100]  Not that, you know, somebody is actually racist, but it's this question.
[03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:29.766]  I can't, you know, I think at some point we're going to see people in front of microphones being asked, are you now or have you ever been affiliated with somebody who could be perceived as racist?
[03:04:29.926 --> 03:04:30.226]  That's right.
[03:04:30.226 --> 03:04:33.948]  What they're doing is initiating a class war.
[03:04:33.948 --> 03:04:38.029]  What they're doing is initiating culture war, and they admit they're doing it.
[03:04:38.029 --> 03:04:41.171]  They're manipulating the poor folks at the lowest levels of it.
[03:04:41.171 --> 03:04:44.292]  I mean, I've seen bars are having reparations where blacks get free drinks.
[03:04:44.292 --> 03:04:50.595]  Look, in reality, I think, you know, these people should understand we all do actually get along pretty well.
[03:04:50.595 --> 03:04:50.955]  That's right.
[03:04:50.955 --> 03:04:52.455]  They're trying to make us not get along.
[03:04:52.455 --> 03:04:52.736]  All right.
[03:04:52.736 --> 03:04:53.636]  David Knight's coming up.
[03:04:54.685 --> 03:04:58.628]  Our team is always looking for new ways to improve our products.
[03:04:58.628 --> 03:05:02.870]  That's why we've created the newest version of a fan favorite formula.
[03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:04.992]  The Real Red Pill Plus.

[03:05:55.383 --> 03:05:56.644]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:05:56.644 --> 03:05:57.465]  Alex Jones.
[03:05:57.465 --> 03:05:58.146]  Alex Jones.
[03:05:58.146 --> 03:05:58.846]  Alex Jones.
[03:05:58.846 --> 03:06:02.029]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.029 --> 03:06:11.516]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:06:11.516 --> 03:06:13.378]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:06:13.378 --> 03:06:17.341]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[03:06:18.776 --> 03:06:23.360]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:26.022]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[03:06:26.022 --> 03:06:28.384]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[03:06:28.384 --> 03:06:29.245]  It's just pancakes.
[03:06:29.245 --> 03:06:34.549]  He took the baby's own incubators and left the children to die on the front lines.
[03:06:35.851 --> 03:06:37.852]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[03:06:37.852 --> 03:06:44.998]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[03:06:44.998 --> 03:06:45.278]  U.S.A.
[03:06:45.278 --> 03:06:48.421]  Is this global governance at last?
[03:06:48.421 --> 03:06:50.983]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[03:06:50.983 --> 03:06:53.505]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[03:06:53.505 --> 03:06:54.266]  Some former U.S.
[03:06:54.266 --> 03:06:56.367]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[03:06:56.367 --> 03:06:59.590]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[03:06:59.890 --> 03:07:05.754]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[03:07:05.754 --> 03:07:07.015]  Russian, stop!
[03:07:07.015 --> 03:07:07.855]  Denied everything.
[03:07:07.855 --> 03:07:09.156]  He called it all fake news.
[03:07:09.156 --> 03:07:11.498]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[03:07:11.498 --> 03:07:14.500]  This is a national emergency.
[03:07:14.500 --> 03:07:20.024]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[03:07:20.024 --> 03:07:21.885]  This is a FEMA high level emergency.
[03:07:25.614 --> 03:07:31.315]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange on Wikileaks?
[03:07:31.315 --> 03:07:34.316]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[03:07:34.316 --> 03:07:37.077]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[03:07:37.077 --> 03:07:41.538]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:41.538 --> 03:07:48.559]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:48.559 --> 03:07:50.659]  We are drugged out!
[03:07:50.659 --> 03:07:52.900]  We are following other people's opinions!
[03:07:54.028 --> 03:07:56.850]  We are controlled by the media.
[03:07:56.850 --> 03:07:58.711]  Today, it all changes.
[03:07:58.711 --> 03:08:01.472]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[03:08:01.472 --> 03:08:04.554]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[03:08:04.554 --> 03:08:09.297]  Einstein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[03:08:09.297 --> 03:08:11.938]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[03:08:11.938 --> 03:08:14.640]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:17.221]  Why don't we just try love?
[03:08:17.221 --> 03:08:18.882]  Why don't we just try love?
[03:08:18.882 --> 03:08:20.203]  We have the resources.
[03:08:22.776 --> 03:08:26.898]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[03:08:26.898 --> 03:08:28.418]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[03:08:28.418 --> 03:08:30.019]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[03:08:30.019 --> 03:08:31.100]  They say Trump's crazy.
[03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:32.180]  They say I'm crazy.
[03:08:32.180 --> 03:08:34.561]  But I'm here to show love.
[03:08:34.561 --> 03:08:39.703]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[03:08:39.703 --> 03:08:43.845]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:08:43.845 --> 03:08:45.606]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:52.423 --> 03:08:53.384]  Alright, welcome back.
[03:08:53.384 --> 03:09:03.216]  This is David Knight with Tyler Nixon and we're going to talk about free speech and the many attacks on free speech that are happening right now because it's not just what's happening with Tommy Robinson.
[03:09:03.216 --> 03:09:06.880]  I mean, that's pretty amazing as we look at what's going on in the UK.
[03:09:07.961 --> 03:09:14.385]  And I think when we look at what happened with Roseanne Barr, it shows us that this is not strictly a UK issue.
[03:09:14.385 --> 03:09:18.807]  We're going to talk about why the two are related coming up.
[03:09:18.807 --> 03:09:22.529]  But you are related to former President Nixon.
[03:09:22.529 --> 03:09:22.789]  I am.
[03:09:22.789 --> 03:09:23.890]  I am very distantly.
[03:09:24.130 --> 03:09:32.295]  Yes, and so I wanted to talk about the Electoral College, because this morning on Real News with David Knight, it was something that I just barely got to.
[03:09:32.295 --> 03:09:37.279]  We had a clip from Hillary Clinton talking about the Electoral College.
[03:09:37.279 --> 03:09:43.022]  And before we get to that, I want to go back, take a brief flashback to October 27, 2016.
[03:09:43.022 --> 03:09:50.928]  And this is about a week before the election, and we had Politico lecturing President Trump
[03:09:51.969 --> 03:09:57.855]  Who was then candidate Trump lecturing him on how he should handle his upcoming defeat.
[03:09:57.855 --> 03:10:06.564]  And one of the things that they went back to was the Electoral College and the 1960 election that was narrowly lost by Richard Nixon to John F. Kennedy.
[03:10:07.325 --> 03:10:23.559]  And so they talk about this, they said, you know, it looks like President Trump is complaining about how we have a rigged system here, that this is, we don't really know how he's going to handle this because we're certain, said Politico a week before the election, we're certain that Trump is going to lose the election.
[03:10:23.559 --> 03:10:25.781]  Is he going to be a good sport about it, like Richard Nixon was?
[03:10:25.781 --> 03:10:28.684]  Because, you know, Richard Nixon had a lot more to complain about
[03:10:29.324 --> 03:10:34.148]  Then President Trump is, because President Trump is just going to get skunked in this election.
[03:10:34.148 --> 03:10:49.221]  But Richard Nixon narrowly lost it to JFK, and as they've talked about this... I was going to say, if you read Roger Stone, you know, Infowars mainstay, Nixon's secrets, as well as the man who killed Kennedy, the case against LBJ,
[03:10:50.129 --> 03:10:54.392]  That election was stolen from Richard Nixon, plain and plain, right here in Texas as well as in Chicago.
[03:10:54.392 --> 03:10:56.173]  That's right, and that's what they point out in Politico.
[03:10:56.173 --> 03:11:10.521]  They say, look, it was a very narrow set of votes, I think it was about 8,000 votes or something in Chicago, that flipped, and of course in Mayor Daley's office, it flipped Illinois for JFK.
[03:11:10.521 --> 03:11:15.364]  And then the other key one, as you just mentioned, Tyler, was here in Texas, and of course you had LBJ.
[03:11:16.344 --> 03:11:19.407]  And as they look at this, they said it was the thinnest of margins.
[03:11:19.407 --> 03:11:23.810]  His lead in the popular vote was only 118,000, Kennedy's lead.
[03:11:23.810 --> 03:11:35.999]  Out of 69 million votes, the tightest popular vote margin since Grover Cleveland's defeat of James G. Blaine in 1884 and Benjamin Harrison's subsequent victory over Cleveland in 1888.
[03:11:35.999 --> 03:11:39.122]  He won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote by 100,000.
[03:11:39.122 --> 03:11:45.447]  So, they're looking at this and I think this is very important when we talk about the Electoral College and we talk about how easily
[03:11:46.407 --> 03:12:00.111]  Uh, elections can be rigged in key areas, because if we don't have an electoral college, and it is simply a, uh, one person, one vote, as Hillary Clinton said, and of course she's not looking at one person, one vote.
[03:12:00.111 --> 03:12:03.372]  Because, uh, what we really should say is one citizen, one vote.
[03:12:03.372 --> 03:12:03.492]  Right.
[03:12:03.492 --> 03:12:08.413]  Because the Democrats now, the game is to stuff the ballot with illegal immigrants.
[03:12:08.473 --> 03:12:09.874]  Yeah, which is astonishing.
[03:12:09.874 --> 03:12:15.116]  I mean, I'm just flabbergasted they've reached a point where it's like, you don't even have to be a citizen, you can vote.
[03:12:15.116 --> 03:12:15.436]  That's right.
[03:12:15.436 --> 03:12:19.057]  In certain jurisdictions, they're trying to register, you know, non-citizens to vote.
[03:12:19.057 --> 03:12:20.778]  I mean, why have a country?
[03:12:20.778 --> 03:12:24.460]  Why have any type of, you know, sovereignty?
[03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:25.100]  That's right.
[03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:26.580]  Or even claim to have it.
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:28.001]  They're upfront about it.
[03:12:28.001 --> 03:12:32.463]  And so I think there's two key things about the Electoral College I want to see if you agree.
[03:12:32.463 --> 03:12:37.025]  Number one, in the wisdom of the founding fathers, they said we don't want to have the vast majority
[03:12:37.925 --> 03:12:37.965]  of
[03:12:56.988 --> 03:12:57.689]  We're good to go.
[03:13:12.706 --> 03:13:20.930]  And the rest of the districts in the county were very lightly populated with farming families that have been there for generations.
[03:13:20.930 --> 03:13:27.953]  And they changed the district representation, they changed it to an at-large.
[03:13:27.953 --> 03:13:40.219]  And what happened was this small corner that had such a large population, they wound up taking over the entire county government and changing everything to a very left-wing agenda.
[03:13:40.459 --> 03:13:43.521]  I can speak to that as well in the little state of Delaware.
[03:13:43.521 --> 03:13:50.505]  The northern county, Newcastle County, is completely dominated by, you know, Labor Democrats and has been for many years.
[03:13:50.505 --> 03:13:51.566]  And they rule the state.
[03:13:51.566 --> 03:13:57.530]  It doesn't matter that the entire lower two counties are largely very conservative and Republican the further south you get.
[03:13:58.851 --> 03:14:06.555]  Well, the state is basically at the mercy of the Northern Liberal Democrats, and that's why you need an allocation.
[03:14:06.555 --> 03:14:08.396]  The Electoral College is a perfect example of it.
[03:14:08.396 --> 03:14:16.220]  In the Federalist Papers, they wanted a diffusion of the direct popular power, the direct Democratic power.
[03:14:16.220 --> 03:14:17.461]  We are not a democracy.
[03:14:17.461 --> 03:14:20.323]  We are a representative republic, and that's the whole point of it.
[03:14:20.823 --> 03:14:37.170]  Is not to have the inflamed impassions of the people or any particular very close vote sway within a national, say, or a giant popular election be able to determine the fate of everybody without there being sort of a breakdown of those constituents.
[03:14:37.170 --> 03:14:40.091]  Now remember, we're the United States of America.
[03:14:40.091 --> 03:14:40.271]  Yes.
[03:14:40.271 --> 03:14:44.533]  And people think of that as one thing, but no, it's the United States as in plural.
[03:14:44.533 --> 03:14:47.274]  That's what is the constituents of this country.
[03:14:48.215 --> 03:14:51.577]  Prior to the Civil War, people talk about the United States are.
[03:14:51.577 --> 03:14:54.719]  And then after the Civil War, they talk about the United States is.
[03:14:54.719 --> 03:15:01.264]  They saw it as a single administrative entity and a top-down pyramid structure, but it was never envisioned to be that way.
[03:15:01.264 --> 03:15:11.592]  The Tenth Amendment makes it clear that they wanted to have powers reserved to these individual states because the thing that the founders feared the most was the consolidation of power into a central area.
[03:15:11.592 --> 03:15:14.474]  And that's what we would have if we didn't have the Electoral College.
[03:15:14.474 --> 03:15:15.775]  We would have a consolidation of power.
[03:15:16.235 --> 03:15:19.498]  Into urban centers, which is what these people like to have.
[03:15:19.498 --> 03:15:21.560]  We're supposed to have a federal republic.
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:26.684]  What we've been moving towards since the era of FDR is a unitary national state.
[03:15:26.684 --> 03:15:26.924]  Yeah.
[03:15:26.924 --> 03:15:29.486]  It's all concentrated nationally.
[03:15:29.486 --> 03:15:30.106]  That's it.
[03:15:30.106 --> 03:15:35.891]  We're like you said, we're one giant government, not a constituent of the states, not a creation of the states.
[03:15:35.891 --> 03:15:40.115]  And that's the way, obviously, the centralized authoritarian status won it.
[03:15:40.115 --> 03:15:40.435]  That's right.
[03:15:40.555 --> 03:15:41.597]  All right, we've got to take a quick break.
[03:15:41.597 --> 03:15:42.378]  We're going to be right back.
[03:15:42.378 --> 03:15:43.840]  I'm David Knight with Tyler Nixon.
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:47.706]  We're going to play that clip from Hillary Clinton, and then we're going to get into free speech issues.
[03:15:47.706 --> 03:15:48.067]  Stay with us.
[03:15:48.067 --> 03:15:48.528]  We'll be right back.

[03:20:17.836 --> 03:20:20.598]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:20:25.043 --> 03:20:32.491]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight and we're here with Tyler Nixon and before we get into the free speech issues, and of course they just keep coming.
[03:20:32.491 --> 03:20:39.719]  It's not just Tommy Robinson, it's not just the slap lawsuits against Infowars, but now we have Roseanne Barr taken off the air.
[03:20:39.719 --> 03:20:46.205]  We're going to get to that in just a moment, unpack that as well as I want to get Tyler's take on
[03:20:47.066 --> 03:20:53.332]  This court decision saying that Trump cannot block anybody or even mute them on Twitter.
[03:20:53.332 --> 03:20:54.873]  Interesting court decision.
[03:20:54.873 --> 03:21:01.540]  I think it's going to backfire on them, just as I think the takeover of the Italian election is going to backfire on the globalists.
[03:21:01.540 --> 03:21:10.127]  But I want to finish up with the Electoral College, because we had Hillary Clinton in her self-pity tour weigh in on this again, and just as a reminder,
[03:21:10.968 --> 03:21:20.633]  A week before the election in 2016, we had Politico lecturing President Trump, who was then candidate Trump, lecturing him on being a gracious loser.
[03:21:20.633 --> 03:21:27.757]  They said Nixon believed that the election was stolen from him by corruption in Chicago, where Mayor Daley was there.
[03:21:27.757 --> 03:21:36.182]  They had that whole state was flipped by 8,800 votes, largely due to margins in Chicago, where Mayor Daley was there, very well known as a corrupt individual.
[03:21:36.702 --> 03:21:41.107]  And then the other place where it was flipped was in Texas, home of LBJ.
[03:21:41.107 --> 03:21:45.992]  And they said if Nixon had carried both of these states, he would have easily won the Electoral College 270 to 252.
[03:21:45.992 --> 03:21:48.474]  And they said, well, the FBI believed that Daley had flipped this.
[03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:57.633]  That's a great question about the FBI, because they had people listening to Daly.
[03:21:57.633 --> 03:22:05.703]  You also have to think, with a margin that thin, 8,800 votes, I guarantee you they were flipping, you know, there was a lot more vote corruption than that.
[03:22:05.703 --> 03:22:08.786]  So you've got to think, Nixon would have probably won convincingly in those two states.
[03:22:08.786 --> 03:22:09.247]  Yes, yes.
[03:22:09.247 --> 03:22:11.910]  Just the fact that it's that slim a margin, even with the corruption.
[03:22:12.110 --> 03:22:19.553]  Well, it was a little bit more in Texas, and where they're talking about this, one of the individuals who reported on this at the time wrote a book on it.
[03:22:19.553 --> 03:22:21.734]  As you pointed out, Roger Stone has written a book on it as well.
[03:22:21.734 --> 03:22:25.376]  But this one individual said, well, in Texas it was a little bit larger.
[03:22:25.376 --> 03:22:30.138]  It was 46,000 fraudulent votes would have had, were required, a skilled manipulator.
[03:22:30.138 --> 03:22:32.799]  You don't think that Lyndon Johnson is a skilled manipulator?
[03:22:32.799 --> 03:22:35.421]  No, no, that's totally, that makes total sense.
[03:22:35.421 --> 03:22:37.342]  Lyndon didn't, he stole big time.
[03:22:37.342 --> 03:22:39.082]  He didn't steal small time, for sure.
[03:22:39.082 --> 03:22:40.383]  That's right, it was wholesale stuff.
[03:22:40.783 --> 03:22:41.003]  I don't
[03:22:58.297 --> 03:23:01.198]  Quite clear to them that he was going to lose by a much larger margin.
[03:23:01.198 --> 03:23:03.118]  Maybe we should send that article to Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:03.118 --> 03:23:07.180]  But here she is on her self-pity tour, now talking about the Electoral College.
[03:23:07.180 --> 03:23:08.780]  And it's not just Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:11.801]  A lot of Democrats are talking about the Electoral College.
[03:23:11.801 --> 03:23:16.262]  They want to get rid of one more safeguard that the founders put into the Constitution.
[03:23:16.262 --> 03:23:17.103]  Here's Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:19.764 --> 03:23:27.586]  And finally, I know this is another really obvious thing to say, vote in every election, not just presidential elections.
[03:23:27.586 --> 03:23:41.090]  You know, it is maddening because one of the panelists said, we get the government that we vote for.
[03:23:41.090 --> 03:23:44.951]  Now we have this odd system with the Electoral College and maybe
[03:23:47.386 --> 03:23:54.352]  You know, we could get President Faust to explain the roots of that because it's a little troubling.
[03:23:54.352 --> 03:23:55.813]  But nevertheless, we've got it.
[03:23:55.813 --> 03:23:57.195]  I've been against it, by the way, since 2000.
[03:23:57.195 --> 03:24:07.804]  Not that you need to know that, but I have been because I just think it is absolutely contrary to, you know, one person, one vote.
[03:24:07.804 --> 03:24:13.329]  So you've got to find an issue that you really care about and go deep.
[03:24:14.377 --> 03:24:15.678]  All right, so there's Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:15.678 --> 03:24:17.259]  She said, we have this odd system.
[03:24:17.259 --> 03:24:18.581]  It's called the Constitution.
[03:24:18.581 --> 03:24:20.903]  And she's been against it since 2000.
[03:24:20.903 --> 03:24:23.785]  And she wants all of us to be against the Constitution as well.
[03:24:23.785 --> 03:24:32.152]  And it's not just the concentration of political power into urban centers that would be what we wind up with nationwide, not just in state by state.
[03:24:32.152 --> 03:24:34.294]  I mean, in Virginia, you talked about your experience.
[03:24:34.294 --> 03:24:38.778]  In Virginia, you've got the areas just outside of Washington, D.C., as well as Virginia Beach.
[03:24:38.778 --> 03:24:42.041]  They dominate that otherwise conservative state.
[03:24:42.741 --> 03:24:48.687]  But that would happen nationally if we didn't have the Electoral College, but she doesn't like that.
[03:24:48.687 --> 03:24:57.535]  Well, she's been against it since 2000, and I'm sure that if Hillary had won the election, she would have been calling for the abolition of the Electoral College as well.
[03:24:57.535 --> 03:25:01.698]  And the Second Amendment, she would be rewriting the Constitution as we speak.
[03:25:01.698 --> 03:25:02.699]  One more thing I want to say about this.
[03:25:07.964 --> 03:25:18.868]  And one of the reasons that you've got the Democrats pushing so hard to get rid of the Electoral College, let's understand, this is about illegal immigrants, foreign citizens, okay?
[03:25:18.868 --> 03:25:20.669]  Illegal immigrants are foreign citizens.
[03:25:20.669 --> 03:25:22.570]  They're criminally trespassing in the United States.
[03:25:22.570 --> 03:25:25.231]  She wants them to vote, as do the other Democrats.
[03:25:25.231 --> 03:25:34.815]  And the state of Alabama is now suing the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Census to make sure that illegal aliens are not included in the census, because if they are,
[03:25:35.515 --> 03:25:41.239]  Then the apportionment of congressional seats is going to work to the advantage of California.
[03:25:41.239 --> 03:25:44.361]  It will make them more powerful by counting the illegal immigrants.
[03:25:44.361 --> 03:25:47.002]  And so the state of Alabama is saying, we don't do that.
[03:25:47.002 --> 03:25:48.703]  We're not a sanctuary state.
[03:25:48.703 --> 03:25:55.368]  And so we don't want foreign citizens counted in California so that California can get more federal power.
[03:25:55.948 --> 03:25:57.529]  No, it's complete insanity.
[03:25:57.529 --> 03:26:00.691]  I mean, you know, what it is, it's majoritarian force.
[03:26:00.691 --> 03:26:22.763]  They just want to overwhelm all the safeguards that the founders put in place to protect, you know, from majoritarian tyranny, which was the whole point of our system, was very carefully constructed with, you know, the checks and balances, the balance of power between, you know, amongst the branches, and as well as the way the voting was not to be direct, you know, direct voting, direct democracy on any issue or any particular election.
[03:26:23.383 --> 03:26:25.664]  Uh, with the exception of the elections of the House of Representatives.
[03:26:25.664 --> 03:26:30.446]  And, you know, as you know, the United States Senate used to be directly, uh, or elected only by the state legislatures.
[03:26:30.446 --> 03:26:35.689]  And that was changed by the, I believe, the, uh, early 20th century.
[03:26:35.689 --> 03:26:36.069]  Yeah.
[03:26:36.069 --> 03:26:41.251]  It was right around the time that they infestrated the power of everybody with the Federal Reserve and the income tax.
[03:26:41.251 --> 03:26:43.192]  Yeah, it was all in one fell swoop.
[03:26:43.192 --> 03:26:48.414]  They display the ability for the state legislatures to assert states' rights, in a sense.
[03:26:48.414 --> 03:26:50.015]  And I'm not saying that with a loaded term.
[03:26:50.015 --> 03:26:52.056]  I mean, literally, the state's power.
[03:26:52.196 --> 03:26:52.757]  State power.
[03:26:52.757 --> 03:26:53.077]  Correct.
[03:26:53.077 --> 03:26:54.278]  State sovereignty.
[03:26:54.278 --> 03:27:01.126]  The state's ability as individual jurisdictions to have a say over how the country, you know, what the fate of the country is.
[03:27:01.126 --> 03:27:03.188]  They used to elect the United States Senate.
[03:27:03.188 --> 03:27:04.029]  People don't realize that.
[03:27:04.029 --> 03:27:07.012]  Now it's a direct election and now they want the president directly elected.
[03:27:07.012 --> 03:27:14.220]  So, you know, they're just trying to overwhelm, again, the barriers that keep the Constitution in place, that keep us from being overwhelmed by majoritarian tyranny.
[03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:14.800]  That's right.
[03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:16.742]  It was about a balance of power.
[03:27:16.742 --> 03:27:19.464]  It was about checks and balances in that power.
[03:27:19.464 --> 03:27:27.049]  It was about making sure that the states, essentially if we were to look at it today, it would be as if we had the United Nations.
[03:27:27.049 --> 03:27:38.777]  We decide to get out of the United Nations and they decide that we're not going to get out and then afterwards we just become an administrative arm of the United Nations and we don't get to have any say-so in what is happening there.
[03:27:38.777 --> 03:27:39.838]  Don't give them any ideas Dave.
[03:27:39.878 --> 03:27:40.498]  Yeah, I know.
[03:27:40.498 --> 03:27:41.618]  Well, I can see it coming.
[03:27:41.618 --> 03:27:50.840]  I can see it coming, not over slavery, but over something like the environment, you know, taking everybody's power away from them.
[03:27:50.840 --> 03:27:52.760]  It's also part of globalism, basically.
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:59.142]  They want a global government and, you know, having all these barriers and these sub-jurisdictions does not serve that purpose.
[03:27:59.142 --> 03:27:59.482]  That's right.
[03:27:59.482 --> 03:28:06.323]  They just want the mass that they can manipulate and say, hey, everybody voted for this and therefore, you know, the whole world's got to abide by this.
[03:28:06.323 --> 03:28:09.565]  I think that the, I talked to Michael Meharry of the Tenth Amendment Center earlier today on Real News, the morning broadcast.
[03:28:31.135 --> 03:28:32.335]  And he was making that case.
[03:28:32.335 --> 03:28:38.197]  He said, look, we're not going to get Washington to surrender power so that we can have our liberty back.
[03:28:38.197 --> 03:28:40.418]  We're going to have to take it at the local level.
[03:28:40.418 --> 03:28:43.619]  We're going to have to reassert the 10th Amendment.
[03:28:43.619 --> 03:28:46.280]  And we can see that happening with medical marijuana.
[03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:51.342]  We can see that happening with people putting teachers in schools with guns, even though the feds have a law against that.
[03:28:51.342 --> 03:28:51.902]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:51.902 --> 03:28:52.262]  Stay with us.

[03:32:57.345 --> 03:32:59.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.941 --> 03:33:14.203]  You found it.
[03:33:14.203 --> 03:33:16.205]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:16.205 --> 03:33:20.590]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:33:22.887 --> 03:33:30.915]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight, here with Tyler Nixon, and let's take a look at the free speech issues because we've just had another one pop up, and that's Roseanne Barr.
[03:33:30.915 --> 03:33:39.443]  She has now been cancelled by ABC News because they didn't like what she tweeted, and understand that this show that they've just cancelled, they had already renewed it.
[03:33:39.443 --> 03:33:39.843]  Why?
[03:33:39.843 --> 03:33:44.108]  Because it is the most popular television show on TV.
[03:33:44.108 --> 03:33:46.350]  ABC cancelled this, and of course they're owned by Disney.
[03:33:47.190 --> 03:33:52.455]  It was the season's number one scripted series on all of broadcast television.
[03:33:52.455 --> 03:33:56.098]  It was the highest rated, most watched series of the entire season.
[03:33:56.098 --> 03:33:57.459]  And they have cancelled it.
[03:33:57.459 --> 03:34:03.444]  Because you know, Tyler, just like we're seeing with the bomb of the Han Solo Star Wars thing.
[03:34:03.784 --> 03:34:14.490]  I think when you look at Disney getting involved in Star Wars, they're more interested in selling their political agenda and their political correctness than they are in ratings or in profits.
[03:34:14.490 --> 03:34:16.331]  I mean, that comes first, doesn't it?
[03:34:16.331 --> 03:34:17.631]  Or even just entertainment, period.
[03:34:17.631 --> 03:34:18.192]  That's right.
[03:34:18.192 --> 03:34:18.412]  Oh yeah.
[03:34:18.412 --> 03:34:21.614]  I mean, Roseanne was very, this was a cutting-edge show.
[03:34:21.614 --> 03:34:27.016]  It used to be that, you know, we would celebrate something that was able to be a sensation that maybe had some political
[03:34:28.657 --> 03:34:49.215]  Undertones or even overtones to it because hey listen you know got people talking it brought it out into you know issues into the open Murphy Brown was a big sensation now granted it was for the other side relatively back in 1991-92 but now forget it Tim Allen silenced off the air you know hugely popular Roseanne Barr you know and Roseanne it was ABC that canceled Tim Allen
[03:34:49.375 --> 03:34:51.936]  Oh yeah, same network, same network.
[03:34:51.936 --> 03:34:57.940]  No, they don't care about entertainment, they apparently don't care about ratings, or even money, profits, whatever, advertising, none of it.
[03:34:57.940 --> 03:35:15.369]  It matters to them only that they silence their opponents, that they not have any type of straying from their speech code, from what they think is acceptable discussion, acceptable discourse, even in a light-hearted, although I honestly feel like that was a show that could bridge the divide.
[03:35:15.809 --> 03:35:19.353]  They could bring people, bring issues out in the open in a way that people could relate to.
[03:35:19.353 --> 03:35:25.079]  That they could understand, hey, we can have these discussions and not be like at each other's throats all the time about it.
[03:35:25.079 --> 03:35:26.480]  And maybe simplify it somewhat.
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:29.763]  Because, you know, she used to be a very, very liberal oriental.
[03:35:29.763 --> 03:35:37.431]  Hated Bush and was always, you know, and look, she is consistent in terms of her, you know, she's an honest person.
[03:35:37.431 --> 03:35:38.252]  Can't have that on the air.
[03:35:38.712 --> 03:35:43.235]  Well, let's take a look at some of the sins of Roseanne Barr.
[03:35:43.235 --> 03:35:57.206]  Earlier in the day, before it was put out that she was cancelled, the headline was this, Roseanne Barr goes on wild and racist tweetstorm about Clinton's George Soros and Chris Saliza and some of the things that she had to say.
[03:35:57.206 --> 03:36:01.209]  She said that George Soros is trying to overthrow the Constitutional Republic.
[03:36:01.209 --> 03:36:03.670]  She talked about CIA mind control and MKUltra.
[03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:04.691]  I wonder why she would do that.
[03:36:04.691 --> 03:36:06.513]  Oh, that may be because we've got
[03:36:07.253 --> 03:36:15.020]  A court case in Canada now of relatives of victims of the MKUltra program back in the 1970s.
[03:36:15.020 --> 03:36:21.065]  As a matter of fact, I'm going to talk to one of them tomorrow morning on Real News with David Knight if you want to catch that.
[03:36:21.065 --> 03:36:23.887]  We're going to have somebody who lived this firsthand.
[03:36:23.887 --> 03:36:30.092]  And folks, mind control by the CIA, these projects by the CIA, by DARPA, have not ended.
[03:36:30.092 --> 03:36:31.373]  You had a $4 billion allocation.
[03:36:32.694 --> 03:36:38.438]  To the BRAIN Project, and that was an acronym, just like DARPA is an acronym, under Obama.
[03:36:38.438 --> 03:36:44.383]  They are still working on ways to alter people's personalities, to implant memories, to delete memories.
[03:36:44.383 --> 03:36:49.286]  And so, this is something that only the technology has changed and the labeling has changed.
[03:36:49.286 --> 03:36:52.649]  So she's talking about the crazy idea of CIA mind control.
[03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:58.114]  You're crazy if you don't understand that's what they have been focused on for the last 60 years.
[03:36:58.114 --> 03:37:00.316]  She called a reporter an effing mouth breather.
[03:37:00.316 --> 03:37:02.278]  I don't even know what that means.
[03:37:02.278 --> 03:37:04.701]  I think most of us breathe through the mouth anyway.
[03:37:04.701 --> 03:37:09.946]  And said that Hillary Clinton was a colostomy jug full of she-ite.
[03:37:12.348 --> 03:37:13.429]  I love that woman.
[03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:24.636]  Yeah, I mean, you know, when you look at this, so the one that now they're focusing on is the fact she said that Valerie Jarrett was a cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes.
[03:37:24.636 --> 03:37:25.317]  Had a baby.
[03:37:25.317 --> 03:37:27.719]  So that was the quote-unquote racist tweet.
[03:37:28.779 --> 03:37:34.985]  Let me tell you, it was just a few weeks ago that we had Mel Brooks at 93, I think he was, 93, 91.
[03:37:34.985 --> 03:37:47.075]  Yeah, talking about how in today's environment he'd never be able to do anything like the producers, where you got, where you're kind of making fun of Hitler and the Holocaust and so forth, and that was the premise there.
[03:37:47.075 --> 03:37:51.859]  As a matter of fact, he had some of the actors who said, I'm not doing that, that were Jewish, Zero Mostel.
[03:37:51.859 --> 03:37:55.682]  But we can't have comedy, as we've been told by
[03:37:56.867 --> 03:37:58.348]  Monty Python, John Cleese and others.
[03:37:58.348 --> 03:37:59.529]  It's a death of comedy.
[03:37:59.529 --> 03:38:02.351]  You couldn't have any comedians like Mel Brooks do their stuff today.
[03:38:02.351 --> 03:38:04.373]  You couldn't have Monty Python doing their stuff.
[03:38:04.373 --> 03:38:05.394]  You couldn't have Rodney Danger.
[03:38:05.394 --> 03:38:09.777]  And none of these people could do a comedy routine today because of the political correctness.
[03:38:09.777 --> 03:38:12.239]  The left is nothing if not humorless, dour.
[03:38:12.879 --> 03:38:17.043]  And consistently self-righteous and sanctimonious.
[03:38:17.043 --> 03:38:21.106]  You know, there are phony pieties constantly in your face.
[03:38:21.106 --> 03:38:22.627]  And yeah, it is the death of humor.
[03:38:22.627 --> 03:38:28.452]  I mean, George Carlin, you look at... And even Mel Brooks' remake of the famous To Be or Not To Be.
[03:38:28.772 --> 03:38:29.373]  Uh-huh.
[03:38:29.373 --> 03:38:31.274]  Which was originally done by Jack Benny in the 1990s.
[03:38:31.274 --> 03:38:32.395]  Oh, look at Blazing Saddle.
[03:38:32.395 --> 03:38:32.575]  Yeah.
[03:38:32.575 --> 03:38:33.656]  All the race shows that he had.
[03:38:33.656 --> 03:38:34.557]  Never, never, my God.
[03:38:34.557 --> 03:38:37.419]  And it's very sad, just in within our lifetimes.
[03:38:37.419 --> 03:38:39.461]  They cannot, you cannot have humor.
[03:38:39.461 --> 03:38:51.511]  You know, I think of Patrice O'Neill was a great comedian who sadly passed away a few years ago, who was someone who went on Fox News as, you know, a black comedian who was very cutting edge and defended
[03:38:52.492 --> 03:38:56.896]  Humor defended the ability to say anything, because that's the point of it, is to push the envelope.
[03:38:56.896 --> 03:39:05.522]  Just as free speech, the point of it is to protect speech that is not acceptable to the main, that is disturbing to people.
[03:39:05.522 --> 03:39:07.644]  That's why you need free speech protections.
[03:39:07.644 --> 03:39:11.848]  Not to protect what everybody is fine with, that's why I have it in the first place.
[03:39:11.848 --> 03:39:12.468]  That's right.
[03:39:13.769 --> 03:39:15.670]  You know, this isn't even controversial.
[03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:18.152]  There's no question that MKUltra existed.
[03:39:18.152 --> 03:39:20.434]  This isn't like a conspiracy theory.
[03:39:20.434 --> 03:39:22.295]  This was brought out by the Church Commission.
[03:39:22.295 --> 03:39:24.957]  This is an acknowledged reality of our government.
[03:39:24.957 --> 03:39:28.520]  They were involved in mind control experiments and everything you can think of.
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:30.301]  Horrific stuff.
[03:39:30.301 --> 03:39:31.722]  Documented, admitted.
[03:39:31.722 --> 03:39:32.983]  Same thing with Mockingbird.
[03:39:33.463 --> 03:39:48.406]  You know, the Project for Operation Mockingbird, where the, you know, it was Colby at the time, could not testify openly as to the implanting or the emplacement of CIA assets in every major news organization in our country.
[03:39:48.686 --> 03:39:51.147]  And now it's not just there, but it's also in presidential campaigns.
[03:39:51.147 --> 03:39:53.428]  Yeah, no, of course, now, right?
[03:39:53.428 --> 03:39:55.088]  And it's an informant, right?
[03:39:55.088 --> 03:40:02.171]  This guy just, you know, who worked with the CIA, whose brother is involved, or he has a family member, I believe, is related, involved, you know what I'm talking about?
[03:40:02.171 --> 03:40:05.732]  He's MI6, something along those lines.
[03:40:05.732 --> 03:40:07.373]  These people are the spooks.
[03:40:07.373 --> 03:40:10.394]  These people are the ones who, you know, dance between the raindrops.
[03:40:10.394 --> 03:40:13.055]  Oh, there's a definite connection between London and Langley.
[03:40:13.055 --> 03:40:14.135]  I talked about that this morning.
[03:40:14.135 --> 03:40:16.236]  You've got Christopher Steele, you've got all these different people, you've even got
[03:40:16.636 --> 03:40:16.796]  I don't
[03:40:36.317 --> 03:40:38.399]  The death of humor, the death of comedy.
[03:40:38.399 --> 03:40:45.124]  And folks, if we don't get rid of this concept of hate speech, it will be the death of free speech.
[03:40:45.124 --> 03:40:47.666]  And that's what we're seeing here, I think, with Roseanne.
[03:40:47.666 --> 03:41:01.317]  Because when we look at Tommy Robinson, we have to understand that the First Amendment was eviscerated in Europe because of the European Union and the UN saying that if you say something that is offensive to somebody, we're going to shut you down.
[03:41:01.937 --> 03:41:10.604]  Now, that is at the root of the UK's beef with Tommy Robinson, when he's out there reporting on these Muslim pedophile gangs.
[03:41:10.604 --> 03:41:13.806]  That's basically their understanding of that.
[03:41:13.806 --> 03:41:27.997]  But it's now gone way beyond that, because it's bad enough that they would arrest him, that they would give him this kangaroo court process, where in just one day he would be arrested, have a quick, speedy trial without a lawyer, and be sent to jail for 13 months.
[03:41:27.997 --> 03:41:30.559]  But then when the judge takes it to the next level,
[03:41:31.059 --> 03:41:36.483]  And says, nobody can report on this, and if you report it on it, you've got to flush it down the memory hole.
[03:41:36.483 --> 03:41:41.907]  That is the thing that's making everybody say, what in the world has happened to the UK?
[03:41:41.907 --> 03:41:45.709]  Why even have, I mean, why not just send him, I mean, why even have that process?
[03:41:45.709 --> 03:41:46.690]  It's a joke.
[03:41:46.690 --> 03:41:50.793]  One day the judge rules on this guy and sends him away and says you can't report on it.
[03:41:50.793 --> 03:41:53.555]  I mean, that's not substantive or procedural due process.
[03:41:53.555 --> 03:41:59.599]  They might as well have literally just issued a dicta from whatever, you know, whatever murky powers were behind this and just lock him away.
[03:41:59.599 --> 03:41:59.799]  No way!
[03:41:59.799 --> 03:42:01.421]  Why even present him before a court?
[03:42:01.421 --> 03:42:08.967]  I mean, it's a farce, it's a complete joke, and this is why we threw off the chains of the British Empire.
[03:42:08.967 --> 03:42:10.028]  Let's not forget, folks.
[03:42:10.028 --> 03:42:10.508]  That's right.
[03:42:10.508 --> 03:42:13.011]  That and religious freedom, free exercise of religion.
[03:42:13.011 --> 03:42:19.797]  But if we go back and look at the tactic, Tyler, that the judge is using, he's using something that's called a de-notice.
[03:42:19.797 --> 03:42:21.998]  What does the de-notice mean?
[03:42:22.779 --> 03:42:24.540]  It means defense.
[03:42:24.540 --> 03:42:34.063]  Everything in America has been, we're told that we don't have any privacy, we don't have any liberty, they're going to surveil us because we have to do something for national security.
[03:42:34.063 --> 03:42:43.426]  How is putting a gag order on news media about this kangaroo court proceedings on Tommy Robinson, how does that relate to national security?
[03:42:43.426 --> 03:42:44.486]  Doesn't make any sense at all.
[03:42:44.486 --> 03:42:45.647]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[03:47:10.134 --> 03:47:11.095]  You found it.
[03:47:11.095 --> 03:47:14.536]  The tip of the spear.
[03:47:14.536 --> 03:47:17.478]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:47:23.658 --> 03:47:26.141]  That's right, they just tell us what they think we ought to know.
[03:47:26.141 --> 03:47:31.287]  And if they think we should know it, they put a gag on it, or at least that's the way they do it in the UK.
[03:47:31.287 --> 03:47:40.857]  I'm David Knight here with Tyler Nixon, and we're going to be going to Harrison Smith in the UK to give us a live update on what is happening there with Tommy Robinson.
[03:47:40.857 --> 03:47:42.379]  As we were pointing out before,
[03:47:43.180 --> 03:47:48.006]  This judge issued, and this is the next step of this, first it begins with hate speech.
[03:47:48.006 --> 03:47:53.311]  And saying we're going to take down anybody if we think that what you're saying is hurtful or if anybody is offended by it, it goes.
[03:47:53.311 --> 03:47:54.413]  And that is already happening.
[03:47:54.413 --> 03:47:55.694]  It happened with Roseanne today.
[03:47:55.694 --> 03:47:58.697]  It is happening to you on social media.
[03:47:58.697 --> 03:48:01.821]  We have people that are being purged and silenced on social media.
[03:48:01.821 --> 03:48:03.002]  That is how it begins.
[03:48:03.883 --> 03:48:11.473]  And those labels of hate are being put out there by the Southern Poverty Law Center, by Snopes and by others on the left.
[03:48:11.473 --> 03:48:18.201]  And if we allow this to happen, folks, we are going to be sliding into the same kind of censorship that we see in the UK.
[03:48:18.201 --> 03:48:19.663]  But they've taken it another step further.
[03:48:20.430 --> 03:48:25.733]  Now they have gone through a kangaroo court process, and the same day they arrested Tommy Robinson.
[03:48:25.733 --> 03:48:36.160]  The judge sentenced him to 13 months in jail, took him off without a lawyer, due process, and then he put out a D Notice, which used to stand for defense.
[03:48:37.100 --> 03:48:38.321]  That's what it originally stood for.
[03:48:38.321 --> 03:48:43.545]  Now, I guess, as we were talking about over the break, Tyler, I guess now the D stands for disappearance.
[03:48:43.545 --> 03:48:49.109]  That appears to be what they are using it for now, because you can't argue that this is an issue of national defense.
[03:48:49.109 --> 03:48:50.030]  Who are they defending?
[03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.270]  Right.
[03:48:50.270 --> 03:48:53.693]  Are they defending their culpability in protecting these Muslim gangs?
[03:48:54.033 --> 03:48:58.295]  Well, I mean, national security now is, it's code for control, basically, is what they want.
[03:48:58.295 --> 03:49:02.897]  They want control, and that's what they'll use it for, is to, they're control freaks, basically.
[03:49:02.897 --> 03:49:06.218]  You look at someone like a Brennan, who's a complete psychopath.
[03:49:06.218 --> 03:49:09.840]  I mean, the way this man thinks, I mean, he literally, it's like, you're out of power, man.
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:10.640]  Like, you're done.
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:14.501]  So stop threatening the president and acting like you're still in power.
[03:49:14.501 --> 03:49:15.702]  And over there, obviously, he's cheating.
[03:49:15.702 --> 03:49:16.502]  Who knows, maybe he is.
[03:49:16.502 --> 03:49:17.163]  Yeah, right.
[03:49:17.163 --> 03:49:17.703]  God only knows.
[03:49:18.463 --> 03:49:21.068]  Alright, we got Harrison standing by.
[03:49:21.068 --> 03:49:22.430]  Harrison Smith in the UK.
[03:49:22.430 --> 03:49:26.137]  Harrison, do you have an update on the status of Tommy Robinson?
[03:49:27.549 --> 03:49:31.590]  Well, I gotta say, that intro song could not be more appropriate.
[03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:44.014]  What I've been doing here, as you can see, I'm in front of the London Bridge on the pier here, and I've been asking people from London, locals, what they know about the Tommy Robinson trial, and they all are informed, but they're misinformed.
[03:49:44.014 --> 03:49:55.117]  You know, I had one guy say, well, you know, I heard that the, I heard the judge tell him specifically that he was not allowed in the courtroom, so he goes in the courtroom, I'm glad that he got caught, and I say, well, you know, he wasn't in the courtroom.
[03:49:55.117 --> 03:49:55.517]  He says, oh.
[03:49:56.326 --> 03:49:56.967]  Oh really?
[03:49:56.967 --> 03:49:58.789]  So yeah, and there were a couple other things.
[03:49:58.789 --> 03:50:05.555]  And so I kept asking him, are you not concerned that you're making decisions with incomplete or incorrect information?
[03:50:05.555 --> 03:50:07.377]  And it's like it doesn't even phase them.
[03:50:07.377 --> 03:50:11.961]  You know, this particular guy, at least, was just like, yeah, well, you know, that's just the way it is sometimes.
[03:50:11.961 --> 03:50:14.444]  And if the court says that they had a reason, then they had a reason.
[03:50:15.225 --> 03:50:16.587]  And there it is.
[03:50:16.587 --> 03:50:17.308]  It's so bizarre.
[03:50:17.308 --> 03:50:31.188]  So that song, when it says, you know, they only tell us what they want us to know, it's amazing how everybody here has, well anybody that knows about him, has a very strong opinion on Tobey Robinson and for the most part, as far as I can tell, it's just based off complete falsehoods.
[03:50:31.713 --> 03:50:36.239]  And so they can characterize this any way they want, as long as they put a gag order on the press.
[03:50:36.239 --> 03:50:47.314]  And I think the other side of this is the supine compliance of the British press, where they just bow down to this judge, and they're not going to stand up against that.
[03:50:47.314 --> 03:50:48.596]  You know, we just had the left
[03:50:49.056 --> 03:50:56.100]  Congratulating themselves about the Pentagon Papers, and I think the Washington Post did the right thing in terms of putting that out.
[03:50:56.100 --> 03:50:58.521]  Maybe you should ask them about Julian Assange.
[03:50:58.521 --> 03:51:04.004]  I mean, they, you know, they don't support the free press with Julian Assange and they don't support it with Tommy Robinson.
[03:51:04.004 --> 03:51:16.550]  If you can get beyond what you think about Julian Assange or what you think about Tommy Robinson and look at the principle of having an open, free society where you've got a free press, I mean, that's really the issue here.
[03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:17.951]  Get beyond the left and right thinking.
[03:51:19.506 --> 03:51:31.812]  Yeah, absolutely, and the Julian Assange point is excellent, especially how the Democrats have this habit of Trump will point out, President Trump will point out that the press is lying, and they say, oh, it's an attack on the press.
[03:51:31.812 --> 03:51:35.654]  He hates the press, he hates the free press, and he's going to destroy it all.
[03:51:35.654 --> 03:51:42.297]  And then you have Julian Assange airs some of their dirty laundry, and they're just like, hey, can we kill this guy?
[03:51:42.577 --> 03:51:43.818]  Let's go ahead and kill this guy.
[03:51:43.818 --> 03:51:48.903]  You know, it's just incredible the dichotomy that's being set up here.
[03:51:48.903 --> 03:51:50.084]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[03:51:50.084 --> 03:51:51.686]  Yeah, I had to respond to a tweet, actually.
[03:51:51.686 --> 03:51:53.027]  Well, it was a statement.
[03:51:53.027 --> 03:51:57.772]  Adam Schiff says he won't... Assange has offered to speak to Adam Schiff and, you know...
[03:51:58.152 --> 03:52:00.133]  Clear Trump and say there was no collusion.
[03:52:00.133 --> 03:52:01.793]  And he says not unless he's extradited.
[03:52:01.793 --> 03:52:03.034]  Someone said when he's extradited.
[03:52:03.034 --> 03:52:06.415]  So you have to be charged with a crime to be extradited, right?
[03:52:06.415 --> 03:52:10.297]  The Justice Department's last position was Assange has committed no crimes.
[03:52:10.297 --> 03:52:13.098]  Unless you want to jail the New York Times and everyone at, you know, Pentagon.
[03:52:13.098 --> 03:52:19.420]  Jail the New York Times, jail the Washington Post, and we should dig up the graves of Ben Bradley and Catherine Grant.
[03:52:20.821 --> 03:52:29.335]  You know, dig them up and, you know, desecrate their bodies because they're not worthy of being respected.
[03:52:29.335 --> 03:52:31.819]  But that's the double-think of the left, isn't it?
[03:52:33.652 --> 03:52:35.533]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[03:52:35.533 --> 03:52:40.335]  And especially with the Tommy Robinson case, I mean, it's just so Orwellian, right?
[03:52:40.335 --> 03:52:53.260]  I mean, you just you couldn't get more totalitarian in this way that, I mean, essentially, he would have just disappeared if it hadn't been, you know, a couple of people with him that saw what happened and that knew what happened that he was able to keep in touch with.
[03:52:53.260 --> 03:52:56.902]  It would have been very easy for them to, you know, arrest this guy.
[03:52:57.262 --> 03:52:57.643]  We're good.
[03:53:10.848 --> 03:53:11.869]  There's not even a word for it.
[03:53:11.869 --> 03:53:13.250]  I mean, it's terrifying.
[03:53:13.250 --> 03:53:22.018]  It's just a terrifying precedent that's being set in a formerly sort of paragon of free speech and of speaking to power that England once was.
[03:53:22.018 --> 03:53:25.040]  Well, it's very much like the movie V for Vendetta.
[03:53:25.040 --> 03:53:28.203]  I mean, honestly, the black bags and they carry you away and that's the end of you.
[03:53:28.203 --> 03:53:32.747]  I mean, honestly, I never thought in my lifetime I would see that come to life in Great Britain.
[03:53:33.147 --> 03:53:41.910]  Now, I mean, the thing is, though, you know, Great Britain, obviously, you know, there is a lot of history there in terms of human rights, but nobody in Britain has ever said, I know my rights.
[03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:44.951]  You know, I mean, because they didn't have them ever enshrined and protected.
[03:53:44.951 --> 03:53:48.752]  You know, it's a royalist society, effectively.
[03:53:48.752 --> 03:53:56.295]  So, you know, they, I mean, we look, just two weekends ago, we had this, you know, this big parade for the royal wedding and so forth and all this gushing and so forth.
[03:53:56.295 --> 03:54:00.656]  And here's this poor man being literally black bagged and taken off and disappeared.
[03:54:02.478 --> 03:54:09.245]  I guess one of my questions, Harrison, maybe you might ask people, you know, the D-Notice.
[03:54:09.245 --> 03:54:11.267]  That was always put up during wartime.
[03:54:11.267 --> 03:54:15.752]  That's when it first started coming out, World War I. They ended it after World War II.
[03:54:15.752 --> 03:54:17.374]  But then they came up with the D-Notice.
[03:54:17.374 --> 03:54:18.716]  What does the D represent?
[03:54:19.136 --> 03:54:20.578]  It was about national defense.
[03:54:20.578 --> 03:54:27.365]  How is taking Tommy Robinson and gagging the press about reporting the facts of this case so that people are ignorant?
[03:54:27.365 --> 03:54:29.928]  How is that an issue of national defense?
[03:54:29.928 --> 03:54:31.629]  Or who are they defending?
[03:54:33.231 --> 03:54:35.934]  Yeah, well, it's pretty clear-cut.
[03:54:35.934 --> 03:54:45.906]  If you're doing things that you think might cause people to rise up against you, yeah, I guess it is, you know, in defense of your position, at least, that nobody else knows that it happened, right?
[03:54:45.906 --> 03:54:48.509]  So, you know, and that's kind of another one of those things.
[03:54:48.509 --> 03:54:51.733]  It's almost the more ridiculous their overreach is,
[03:54:52.554 --> 03:54:59.242]  It sort of becomes an argument for the suppression of that being brought to light, right?
[03:54:59.242 --> 03:55:03.707]  It's like, well, we can't tell anybody about this or else they'd be so mad.
[03:55:03.707 --> 03:55:09.153]  I believe there was a leaked quote from Hillary Clinton that said, you know, if this gets out, we'll all swing from nuisances.
[03:55:09.153 --> 03:55:10.255]  I mean, that's essentially...
[03:55:12.953 --> 03:55:18.857]  I think what this represents, and we all understand this is happening, we can see it happening in the United States with social media.
[03:55:18.857 --> 03:55:21.238]  We can see it happening with Roseanne Barr.
[03:55:21.238 --> 03:55:29.523]  If you don't support the free speech of people that you disagree with, even people that you think are repulsive, then you will have no free speech whatsoever.
[03:55:29.523 --> 03:55:33.185]  This all began with the hate speech laws and so forth that have
[03:55:33.385 --> 03:55:43.248]  Are being imposed on us by our social media oligarchs here, but we're imposed on the UK by the UN, by the EU, by their redefining of free speech.
[03:55:43.248 --> 03:56:00.332]  Once you get to that point, and once they're able to silence speech on that basis, now we have still taken it to the next level with Tommy Robinson and this D-notice that should be frightening, but I think we all see that we're on a slippery slope where we have thrown away the values of Western society and what really is
[03:56:00.652 --> 03:56:01.134]  Tolerance.
[03:56:01.134 --> 03:56:03.881]  You know, they always want to talk about how, oh, you're so intolerant and everything.
[03:56:03.881 --> 03:56:06.027]  They're intolerant of speech that they don't agree with.
[03:56:09.466 --> 03:56:13.387]  How much differently is a D-Notice from National Security Letters, FISA warrants?
[03:56:13.387 --> 03:56:15.868]  We have that in our own country right now, let's face it.
[03:56:15.868 --> 03:56:19.710]  You can't even speak about it if you have a National Security Letter, even to your attorneys.
[03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:26.933]  I don't see how that jives with anything, but go ahead Harrison, I'm sorry I jumped in there.
[03:56:26.933 --> 03:56:29.554]  It reminds me of another story that just came out today.
[03:56:32.876 --> 03:56:38.167]  What's our second amendment which you know is is that you know gun control in England they just
[03:56:39.165 --> 03:56:42.287]  A judge just came out and said, maybe we should dull knives.
[03:56:42.287 --> 03:56:44.929]  Maybe we should blunt the end of knives.
[03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:45.550]  Right?
[03:56:45.550 --> 03:56:53.675]  And so it's this thing where, you know, what they really hate is the idea that people are angry enough to cause violence.
[03:56:53.675 --> 03:56:57.177]  So, you know, the end result is, let's just stop people from being angry.
[03:56:57.177 --> 03:56:58.258]  Let's drug people.
[03:56:58.258 --> 03:57:01.440]  So they just, you know, it's really the emotion that's the cause.
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:05.103]  Because what they're doing is they're eliminating the use of the tools, but the
[03:57:06.149 --> 03:57:08.893]  The base, you know, cause of it is still there.
[03:57:08.893 --> 03:57:11.156]  It's the same thing with free speech.
[03:57:11.156 --> 03:57:18.766]  They use hate speech laws or, you know, breaching the peace or, you know, they're trying to eliminate the tools.
[03:57:18.766 --> 03:57:22.070]  But really what they want to do is eliminate you having a free thought at all.
[03:57:22.230 --> 03:57:24.613]  Well, I think this stuff is going to backfire on them.
[03:57:24.613 --> 03:57:29.098]  I think gradually the people of England are going to wake up to this tyranny.
[03:57:29.098 --> 03:57:38.849]  I think the movement by a judge here in the United States saying that President Trump cannot ban people on Twitter, he can't block them, he can't mute them.
[03:57:38.849 --> 03:57:42.513]  Well, if he can't do that, how can the president of Twitter do that?
[03:57:47.299 --> 03:57:53.022]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.

[03:58:51.108 --> 03:58:53.650]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[03:58:53.650 --> 03:58:57.854]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge.
[03:58:57.854 --> 03:58:59.896]  And the world is taking notice.
