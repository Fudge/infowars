[00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:11.513]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.137]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:16.760]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:19.203]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.164 --> 00:00:21.867]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:28.375]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:39.411]  Well, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,400 points, as we speak, in the controlled demolition of the U.S.
[00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.073]  economy that the globalists promised they would engage in.
[00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:52.820]  And if you look at the world economy, they're specifically targeting nation-states like Italy and Spain and the U.K.
[00:00:53.921 --> 00:01:00.105]  that are refusing to go under carbon taxes, refusing to go under the total global government takeover.
[00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:07.636]  And that's why in the last few weeks we've been saying, get ready for the controlled demolition of the economy, because the globalists were saying they'd do it.
[00:01:09.017 --> 00:01:13.062]  And now they're out in the open, and they're actually doing it.
[00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:22.312]  You know, the reason Infowars has been so demonized and so attacked and so punished is the answer to stopping this authoritarian world government.
[00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:27.089]  If you know why they hate us, then you know the answers of how to stop them.
[00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:46.537]  We've been able to go against the main narrative of worshipping crony capitalism in authoritarian countries like China, and you've seen the public, not just because of info wars, but because of corporate media lying, they've lost all their credibility.
[00:01:47.697 --> 00:01:54.146]  And so we were able, along with many others, to promote the relaunch of the idea of real free market Americana.
[00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:57.831]  And we're able to really discredit globalism.
[00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:02.136]  And once globalism is exposed as an above-the-law criminal institution,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:18.690]  You can stall for a while, you can threaten countries with economic collapse, you can even engage in that type of activity, but as you do it, you only create that much more anger, that much more hatred, that much more resistance, that much more determination.
[00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:22.773]  And we see that everywhere.
[00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:30.138]  Everywhere in the real politics of the street, from South America to Europe, from Africa to Asia, from North America,
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.525]  Across the world, everywhere, people are awake to the New World Order.
[00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:44.254]  And Secretary of State Pompeo just gave a speech in front of a globalist group yesterday.
[00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:47.037]  Jamie White wrote about it for Infowars.com, got almost no attention.
[00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.601]  And he said, we're changing the New World Order.
[00:02:52.418 --> 00:02:56.200]  To actually be liberal and take care of the nation states and empower the people.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.141]  Now he's showing what a thoroughbred constitutionalist he is.
[00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.503]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:02.803]  I'm a liberal.
[00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:07.906]  Lower taxes, more freedom, more private property, guns.
[00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:16.350]  It's liberal in the classic sense when only the king or his men could be armed to say no the general public can be armed.
[00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:21.357]  Hundreds of years of war in England just to get that right established.
[00:03:21.377 --> 00:03:23.038]  Everywhere else, commoners didn't have it.
[00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:32.484]  And so we see this attack in the name of modern liberalism, which is really leftist ideology, the opposite of true liberalism, to reverse all that to where these terms mean nothing.
[00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:37.627]  But he went in there and he told the EU and others that America is going to lead.
[00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:48.637]  We intend to leave now and always, and we're not going to recede into the past like the Council on Foreign Relations and David Rockefeller and George Herbert Walker Bush and others said we were supposed to.
[00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:57.698]  Now America's very sick, and America was on its deathbed, and the ideology of the left is America-hating and family-hating and God-hating.
[00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:07.180]  But like chicken noodle soup when you got the flu that mama brings you, Trump and Pompeo and Infowars and all of us are really trying to bring back
[00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.320]  What really works.
[00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.804]  We're trying to move us into the future again with the Renaissance.
[00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:17.108]  So when I say go back, the globalists are going back to authoritarianism.
[00:04:17.148 --> 00:04:20.612]  We're saying let's go back to the latest, greatest thing that worked.
[00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:24.296]  You know, like oxygen on a submarine.
[00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:25.417]  You kind of need it.
[00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.138]  Or sunshine for plants to grow.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.261]  And so that's the revolution that's taking place.
[00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:47.488]  It's humanity trying to stop the globalist technocracy revolution that sees humanity as obsolete, the world as overpopulated and wants a post-industrial world for the general public and a return to feudalism with only super high-tech reservations for the elite existing.
[00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.710]  And Trump and others are betting on humanity for a pro-human future.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.701]  This is the heart of the matter.
[00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:57.823]  We'll discuss it all on the other side of the most censored broadcast in the world.
[00:04:58.404 --> 00:04:58.984]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:09.491]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:15.835]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:18.677]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits,
[00:05:18.897 --> 00:05:22.299]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.803]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:35.167]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:40.050]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse
[00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:49.777]  To help you reach optimal gut and colon health, our gentle natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.341]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[00:05:54.821 --> 00:06:02.267]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:18.186]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:20.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:34.550]  The first two years of the Trump administration demonstrate that President Trump is not undermining these institutions, nor is he abandoning American leadership.
[00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:36.471]  Quite the opposite.
[00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:47.147]  In the finest traditions of our great democracy, we are rallying the noble nations of the world to build a new liberal order that prevents war and achieves greater prosperity for all.
[00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:53.309]  We're supporting institutions that we believe can be improved.
[00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:01.432]  Institutions that work in American interests, and yours, in service of our shared values.
[00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:25.357]  The clip you just saw is from a 30-minute speech posted to Infowars.com that has the remarks of the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
[00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:33.323]  Trump reforming liberal international order so it may serve our citizens not control them close quote.
[00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:40.529]  Secretary of State tells roomful of globalist America intends to lead
[00:07:42.082 --> 00:07:43.643]  Now and always.
[00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:56.428]  Imagine if I told you 20 years ago, which I did, that we would come to a point where mainstream corporate media would say that even having a nation existing is evil and bad.
[00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.890]  And the president saying that we are nationalist is inherently bad.
[00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:09.014]  Or that mothers and fathers existing is bad and that children should be raised in communal dorms.
[00:08:10.183 --> 00:08:12.085]  And sexualized at a young age.
[00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:14.026]  I did tell you that.
[00:08:14.567 --> 00:08:15.368]  And it has come true.
[00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:18.330]  And how is it coming true?
[00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:19.852]  How did I know?
[00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:22.053]  Because the globalists have admitted their whole plan.
[00:08:22.954 --> 00:08:34.444]  And that's what's so frustrating, is that I read their textbooks, I read their white papers, I watch their speeches, I study their program going back to
[00:08:35.623 --> 00:08:44.207]  It was adopted by the British Royalty, the British Empire, the Dutch East India Company, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and much of the U.S.
[00:08:44.267 --> 00:08:45.028]  establishment.
[00:08:45.688 --> 00:09:01.876]  By the 1860s, they had officially adopted the theorem and the ideology of eugenics developed by Sir Francis Galton and his other cohorts, Charles Darwin and others.
[00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.144]  And of course, I made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, 11 years ago.
[00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:10.266]  You watch it now and you're like, 90% of this has come true.
[00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:12.948]  People watch it and they say, you must be an insider.
[00:09:12.988 --> 00:09:16.151]  How the insiders tell you what they're doing.
[00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:30.321]  Planetary government, forced microchipping to buy and sell, face scanning to buy and sell, global social score, where if you're not a good little globalist, literally you starve to death and cannot move one foot.
[00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:33.463]  That has now been officially announced.
[00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:40.011]  It's so frustrating to watch them talk to the public like children, and have the public operate like children.
[00:09:41.392 --> 00:09:47.435]  Because... This is the whole real world we're talking about.
[00:09:48.395 --> 00:10:00.221]  And the British Empire adopted this pseudoscience to take control of civilization, and they've basically done it.
[00:10:02.165 --> 00:10:05.866]  And it's not your pop eugenics that you get out of the encyclopedia.
[00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:08.067]  It's real eugenics.
[00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.451]  And if you look at it and you study it, here's the big revelation.
[00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:25.433]  Here's the giant revelation.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:33.301]  Because I can sit here and talk about all the news and play all the clips and make the show really interesting, but if I don't go back to the basics here, we don't have a hope.
[00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:47.104]  I don't know the exact specifics of when they plan to execute every step of their operation.
[00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:53.986]  And I don't know every detail
[00:10:55.285 --> 00:11:07.132]  But from their own statements, their own past actions, and from watching the results of what the global technocrats are carrying out, I'm going to say this very succinctly and clearly.
[00:11:08.332 --> 00:11:10.333]  And this is why, number one, they want us off the air.
[00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:20.079]  The planet is not being geoengineered.
[00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:32.625]  Geoengineering means you're making something better or nicer and you're doing it for the dominant species on the planet for their needs.
[00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:48.792]  The terraforming operations going on publicly, the genetic engineering, all of it, every metric
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:56.963]  And in their own white papers show there is an attempt to collapse the atmosphere, similar to what happened to Mars.
[00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:16.412]  And there is a real attempt to irrevocably destroy the DNA double helix genetic profile, not just of humans, but of every species on Earth.
[00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:21.508]  Now you notice the globalists always take control of anything that they're running.
[00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:37.501]  So if they're trying to kill the planet and slowly mutate and basically devolve and destroy all current life forms, you can debate all day why they're doing it or who they are.
[00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:44.329]  Is this, you know, is this just evil humans playing God, or is somebody else, you know, giving them the information?
[00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:45.130]  We don't know that.
[00:12:45.570 --> 00:13:02.543]  But what we know without any debate, without any discussion, hands down, on its face, everything being done by the Department of Energy and by these multinational corporations,
[00:13:03.476 --> 00:13:14.685]  With the Terminator genetic line, and the cloning, and the glyphosate, everything is specifically being done to irrevocably destroy us.
[00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:21.310]  With a soft kill, so we never even know what hit us.
[00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:30.618]  And you notice the big point, you're never supposed to talk about the chemicals in the water hurting animal and plant life.
[00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.913]  You're never supposed to talk about the attack on the two genders.
[00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:37.454]  You're never supposed to talk about the world government.
[00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:39.016]  All the things that are there in public.
[00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:51.866]  You know, they've gone from denying the giant geoengineering program, that's really terraforming, to now saying, oh, we're going to save the earth, Bill and Melinda Gates, Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:13:54.307 --> 00:14:01.033]  We're going to spray barium salts and aluminum dioxide and radioactive isotopes into the air by the
[00:14:02.444 --> 00:14:02.924]  We're good to go.
[00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:33.036]  But everything else, the GMO, the allergies exploding, the cancer exploding, the infant mortality exploding, the life expectancy, lifespan plunging, every metric, we are being killed.
[00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:35.117]  We're being murdered.
[00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:41.038]  And we're being culturally and spiritually poisoned as well, at a just warfare level.
[00:14:43.467 --> 00:15:01.145]  And then I see other talk show hosts across the board, big podcasters, you name it, who know all this, and they relish their seat at the table, and they relish that they're part of the power structure, they think, and that they're playing ball with it.
[00:15:02.608 --> 00:15:09.091]  And the 5G on record, they even tell you in every publication, like cigarettes say they can kill you.
[00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:10.912]  5G rattles your DNA into pieces.
[00:15:11.192 --> 00:15:16.334]  It's at the perfect frequency to give you brain cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer.
[00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:18.235]  I mean, it's just murdering everyone.
[00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.932]  I mean, we are being murdered right now.
[00:15:22.392 --> 00:15:23.833]  Your family, I, all of us.
[00:15:24.273 --> 00:15:26.995]  We are under biblical assault.
[00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:40.204]  Oh, and then there's this book called the Bible, that the Old Testament and the New Testament, in at least six books, says in the future there'll be a world government, and it describes all of this plan.
[00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:43.689]  Down to the fine detail.
[00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:48.291]  And now it's here, but not in any of these churches.
[00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:49.191]  They don't talk about it.
[00:15:50.712 --> 00:15:51.753]  So, let me tell you something.
[00:15:51.793 --> 00:15:53.073]  We're not in Kansas.
[00:15:53.093 --> 00:15:53.954]  We've never been in Kansas.
[00:15:54.194 --> 00:15:57.775]  We're on a planet in deep space, and we're getting jacked with.
[00:15:58.456 --> 00:16:01.017]  And the establishment is working with whoever is running this.
[00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:11.277]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[00:16:11.577 --> 00:16:22.705]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.

[00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:47.898]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the New World Order and the Globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty, and trying to shut down the free press is.

[00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:53.518]  It's hard to procure it anymore, so we're discontinuing it.
[00:17:53.538 --> 00:17:55.439]  You know it's a bestseller at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:59.503]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWar possible.
[00:17:59.884 --> 00:18:01.846]  Again, you are the resistance.
[00:18:02.487 --> 00:18:08.955]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:18:10.646 --> 00:18:12.107]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:18:12.328 --> 00:18:17.272]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[00:18:18.453 --> 00:18:24.379]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[00:18:25.139 --> 00:18:32.806]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:59.717]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[00:19:00.965 --> 00:19:07.287]  We are losing money on this, but we're gonna help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:09.488]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:14.129]  I love my state, but if you got a business and a company here and you got merchandise, BS.
[00:19:14.949 --> 00:19:15.429]  It's big.
[00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:16.369]  It's bad.
[00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:22.051]  So, we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[00:19:22.071 --> 00:19:24.372]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[00:19:24.812 --> 00:19:28.013]  So, to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[00:19:28.633 --> 00:19:29.575]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:19:29.615 --> 00:19:30.776]  That's been going on for over a month.
[00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:32.779]  50 to 75% off.
[00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:33.800]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[00:19:34.878 --> 00:19:35.819]  The Double Patriot points!
[00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:36.739]  That's what happened in about a week.
[00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:43.743]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day, a free gift on top of it, and special mega-sales every day.
[00:19:44.203 --> 00:19:48.566]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:48.606 --> 00:19:50.487]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:52.548]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:19:52.748 --> 00:19:54.789]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:58.971]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:10.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:32.002]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:20:36.207 --> 00:20:39.128]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:41.688 --> 00:20:41.988]  Okay.
[00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:48.470]  I'm going to cover all the current world news and the stock market plunging 1,500 points and how the globalists said they'd do it.
[00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.650]  We told you it was about to happen.
[00:20:50.391 --> 00:20:51.471]  Next month's news today.
[00:20:51.491 --> 00:21:04.194]  But please, if you're a new listener especially, but if you're a long-time listener, if what I'm saying is even partially true, everyone should really be upset about it, right?
[00:21:05.469 --> 00:21:22.813]  But I'm telling you, if you go research the globalists saying they're going to establish a world government, and they are going to have AI that rules the planet, and then they are going to merge with machines and ascend, but before they can ascend, humanity must be exterminated.
[00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:26.133]  Now that's in my film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:21:26.593 --> 00:21:27.334]  Made it 11 years ago.
[00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:29.114]  But I was talking about it for 20 plus years.
[00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:35.993]  You turn on Discovery Channel, History Channel, you listen to Elon Musk, who meets with these globalists.
[00:21:37.715 --> 00:21:50.345]  You listen to Bill Joy, countless others, and they'll say, yeah, we go to these big billionaire conferences, and the discussion is, do we just go ahead and exterminate humanity because they're obsolete, or do we let people just play video games all day?
[00:21:51.906 --> 00:21:54.668]  And the answer is, we're just going to phase folks out as quickly as possible.
[00:21:55.469 --> 00:21:56.690]  Now, obviously, they don't tell
[00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:00.639]  99% of people, the full plant.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:10.042]  If you go to any major university, the heads of departments, like Dr. Pionka at UT, the head of the biology department, remember him?
[00:22:12.483 --> 00:22:14.524]  He's shed on his UT website.
[00:22:14.564 --> 00:22:20.706]  He's a Luciferian, he does Druid rituals, and then he won the Texas Academy of Sciences Award.
[00:22:20.746 --> 00:22:22.067]  He's just one example.
[00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:29.500]  And he projected a bunch of skulls on the wall and said, I can't wait for the airborne Ebola to be released.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.821]  It'll kill 90 plus percent.
[00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:35.883]  He got a standing ovation when he said, it's time to wipe out humanity.
[00:22:36.884 --> 00:22:38.464]  He said, me and my family were ready to die.
[00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:46.168]  And then some of his graduate students got very threatening with me, found out a few of them worked in government bioweapons labs.
[00:22:53.868 --> 00:22:55.888]  And they said, well, you know, he says only get rid of 90%.
[00:22:55.928 --> 00:22:57.129]  We have to get rid of everybody.
[00:22:57.169 --> 00:23:09.271]  So I'm just giving you a little snapshot examples of this, that when you look at the Bushes or you look at the Clintons, they're just high-level functionaries of the real power behind the throne.
[00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:13.411]  And they're setting up a post-human future.
[00:23:14.992 --> 00:23:21.733]  We always see the news like, oh, the robots are coming and they'll show some Boston Dynamics, you know, robot that can do back flips.
[00:23:23.123 --> 00:23:43.013]  The real machine takeover is the cars all driving you, there being no more farmers, school teachers being robots, surgeons being robots, and humans being removed and made obsolete, and then the people controlling the robots and controlling the technocracy, they're running the show.
[00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:51.597]  The real AI is the Alexa in your house, listening and recording everything you do, and then running it through big AI algorithms.
[00:23:54.833 --> 00:24:00.875]  And it's all here, and it's all being done with the post-human future in mind.
[00:24:03.015 --> 00:24:05.656]  From the statements of the establishment.
[00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:21.800]  And if you go back to Darwin, Wedgwood, Huxley, Galton, they were all a form of intellectual royalty in England.
[00:24:23.976 --> 00:24:27.417]  And they even started a breeding program to try to create supermen.
[00:24:28.477 --> 00:24:29.838]  And Aldous Huxley was one of those.
[00:24:31.478 --> 00:24:33.499]  So was his brother Julian Huxley, if you believe it.
[00:24:34.099 --> 00:24:35.159]  They thought they were supermen.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:50.664]  And Darwin, if you actually, don't just read the pop stuff about him, but actual books he wrote, not just his theory on the species, he had 115 fever when he was in a third world jungle.
[00:24:52.441 --> 00:25:11.315]  And he believed he was contacted by entities that told him about evolution and the future and these new sciences, but that for man to ascend, we had to merge with machines and take control over evolution, but that the general public under social Darwinism had to be killed.
[00:25:13.196 --> 00:25:22.263]  And then you read the books of Arthur C. Clarke, inventor of the telecommunications satellite, 2001 Odyssey, Space Odyssey, notice it's the same story.
[00:25:25.342 --> 00:25:36.270]  And this obelisk comes, it takes control of human evolution, and then all of a sudden it sends us another signal from the moon and another signal to Jupiter or Saturn, depending on the book of the movie.
[00:25:37.651 --> 00:25:39.733]  And the human has to go transcend.
[00:25:40.093 --> 00:25:42.034]  First, the other humans have to die.
[00:25:42.815 --> 00:25:48.759]  Then the other human has to go through this time gate and then come back reincarnated as the star child.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.400]  And then you read his other books.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.602]  Like Childhood's End, I don't just have to know this from reading it.
[00:25:56.042 --> 00:26:04.647]  He gave speeches and admitted that this is basically an allegory on what they believe they're doing.
[00:26:06.488 --> 00:26:14.673]  And so in Childhood's End, the aliens that are giving this technology don't want to show themselves because it's a little too scary, because some earlier humans saw them and said they were really bad.
[00:26:15.093 --> 00:26:23.879]  But they're about nine feet tall and are big red devils with big black horns, like out of the classical archetype or out of legend.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.322]  So big tall red demons with big giant black horns.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.445]  And they give us unlimited technology, life extension, everything else, no more crime, everything's great, for about a hundred years.
[00:26:37.726 --> 00:26:46.033]  But then they start taking control of the children and saying there's no genders, and then you can't be with your parents anymore, but everybody's getting life extension and all this other stuff, so it's okay.
[00:26:46.854 --> 00:26:57.743]  And then finally, a few more generations later, they just go ahead and tell them, we're gonna upload you into this big cube that's set to show up, and the big tall red devils are good guys,
[00:26:59.138 --> 00:27:05.759]  According to this, and they're just guardians of this and work for this consciousness, and then we're all uploaded to the cube, if you believe that.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.740]  Of course, that's what our friendly little red devils are telling us.
[00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:20.203]  And then, Ogressy Clark basically said, well, these really aren't science fiction books.
[00:27:20.763 --> 00:27:22.043]  This is what we're going to do to you.
[00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:26.676]  And there's The Things to Come, The Shape of Things to Come, the film, the book.
[00:27:27.377 --> 00:27:28.338]  You've got H.G.
[00:27:28.378 --> 00:27:31.682]  Wells who wrote more non-fiction books than he wrote fiction.
[00:27:32.002 --> 00:27:39.631]  He wrote in 1900 about atomic bombs and the equations for atomic bombs because they already had those equations.
[00:27:40.981 --> 00:28:05.309]  And then they decided when they would roll that out to you and just recently they declassified Max Planck had a bunch of equations that had been kept secret by the Austro-Hungarian Empire that of course had the hydrogen bomb equations that he'd written up, he published them privately in 1900 as well, but he had had the equations 20 years before.
[00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:09.270]  Oh, and guess where a lot of these mathematicians actually
[00:28:10.886 --> 00:28:11.827]  Get the inspiration.
[00:28:11.887 --> 00:28:20.752]  It's when they're dreaming, and almost all of them in their diaries said that they were talking to spirits or entities that were giving them the knowledge.
[00:28:21.353 --> 00:28:26.956]  Just like Galton, Wedgwood, Huxley, Darwin, all of them.
[00:28:27.257 --> 00:28:34.301]  So you think of aliens arrive in this dimension in flying saucers, or Pacific Rim, they come out of a rift in a dimension, and break into our dimension.
[00:28:34.721 --> 00:28:37.023]  But see, if there's all these dimensions above and below us,
[00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.351]  See, it's right here.
[00:28:39.371 --> 00:28:40.692]  We only just see this limited dimension.
[00:28:41.312 --> 00:28:42.593]  It's actually... We're psychic.
[00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:43.294]  Everybody knows that.
[00:28:43.674 --> 00:28:44.835]  We are transceivers.
[00:28:44.855 --> 00:28:45.676]  We transmit, receive.
[00:28:45.696 --> 00:28:46.316]  It's been proven.
[00:28:46.896 --> 00:28:48.197]  Well, see, there's a broadcast.
[00:28:48.758 --> 00:28:55.023]  And there's some really bad folks in the universe who are broadcasting blueprints to kill everybody.
[00:28:55.503 --> 00:28:57.405]  And our establishment goes, oh, this is incredible.
[00:28:57.585 --> 00:28:58.705]  We've been given this by God.
[00:28:59.046 --> 00:28:59.786]  It ain't God.
[00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:01.167]  And God warned us about it 2,000 years ago.
[00:29:13.024 --> 00:29:16.426]  Well, I could not think of a better guest to come on with us right now.
[00:29:16.486 --> 00:29:23.890]  He was born and raised in South Africa, traveled here with his wife and family in the 1980s as one of the most successful true Bible-believing churches in the U.S.
[00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.832]  and huge outreach globally, Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown.
[00:29:27.012 --> 00:29:30.294]  And he's with us for the rest of the hour, KillingUncleSamBook.com.
[00:29:30.354 --> 00:29:32.836]  This is his new book, Revival.com.
[00:29:32.956 --> 00:29:34.777]  Pastor Brown, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:29:34.797 --> 00:29:38.859]  I want to talk about prophecy and where we are historically and how important all this is.
[00:29:38.879 --> 00:29:40.480]  And then I want to get into the good news.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.386]  When the great evil comes in, though, that will cause this great awakening, won't it?
[00:29:44.406 --> 00:29:44.686]  Yes.
[00:29:44.746 --> 00:29:48.171]  First of all, again, I was watching you before the previous hour.
[00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:49.133]  You're on fire.
[00:29:49.473 --> 00:29:56.224]  People might not understand your passion, Alex, but when you know all these things, then you know you can make this stuff up.
[00:29:56.784 --> 00:29:58.145]  We're living in the final hour.
[00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:01.228]  The final grains of sand are coming through the hourglass.
[00:30:01.388 --> 00:30:06.493]  And as you know, all that has to happen for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing.
[00:30:06.593 --> 00:30:08.375]  So your voice is important.
[00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:10.337]  That's obviously why they try to shut you up.
[00:30:10.857 --> 00:30:13.580]  But they're not going to shut you up, and they're not going to shut anyone up.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.221]  That we'll just stand up for righteousness and we'll proclaim.
[00:30:17.622 --> 00:30:22.604]  And if something happens to us, there'll be many that will come on behind us and take our place.
[00:30:22.664 --> 00:30:27.466]  So, there's an army of believers that is being raised up all across Europe.
[00:30:27.886 --> 00:30:29.106]  And they're behind the scenes.
[00:30:29.326 --> 00:30:38.270]  They're in the Ukraine, they're in Russia, they're in Bulgaria, they're in Hungary, they're in Bratislava, they're in Finland even, Sweden, Norway.
[00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:46.259]  I mean, it actually is very encouraging when you travel and then you meet people at the grassroots level and they made a decision.
[00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:47.761]  We're not going out quietly.
[00:30:47.841 --> 00:30:49.963]  And then also to see the people that love Trump.
[00:30:50.063 --> 00:30:55.209]  From Finland to Bratislava, they're wearing mega Make America Great Again hats.
[00:30:55.409 --> 00:30:55.850]  France.
[00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.514]  The pastors in France that said how they appreciate the president.
[00:30:59.674 --> 00:31:10.538]  So, whatever you see on mainstream media is just total bull, but local churches is where we have to build this engine room to take the city, to take a nation, as the church in Budapest is doing.
[00:31:10.658 --> 00:31:19.401]  So, over the total trip was 23,200 attendants, 7,860 in the altar call, and 3,800 leaders mobilized.
[00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:24.823]  So, it doesn't take that many, Alex, if you can put the fire on just several.
[00:31:24.923 --> 00:31:27.104]  But let me say this about what happened with Budapest.
[00:31:27.284 --> 00:31:39.546]  And I mean, I've got some things I could share with you, but maybe you don't want me to share them on the air of some supernatural things that actually took place of how we actually ended up in Budapest because we went to Bratislava.
[00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:41.227]  We were not scheduled to go to Budapest.
[00:31:41.487 --> 00:31:42.507]  That was our night off.
[00:31:43.147 --> 00:31:52.569]  And through a series of events that really was involving, I know people might not believe it, but involving an angel of the Lord that spoke to the pastor to have me come.
[00:31:53.069 --> 00:31:54.089]  I went to that church.
[00:31:55.009 --> 00:32:00.552]  These guys are shaking hungry, and immediately I heard the Lord say, go and strengthen him.
[00:32:00.672 --> 00:32:10.238]  So I went there, and then he told me he was praying, and he said he had his eyes closed, and he said he heard a voice say, look up, he looked up, and there was an angel standing to the side.
[00:32:10.478 --> 00:32:14.220]  And the angel said, have Rodney Brown come to Budapest tomorrow night.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:21.221]  Now, people might not believe this, but that's how I ended up in Budapest on Saturday night, on the only night supposed to be my off night.
[00:32:21.361 --> 00:32:23.402]  And let me tell you, it was electrifying.
[00:32:23.522 --> 00:32:26.542]  Alex, if I took you there, I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[00:32:26.722 --> 00:32:28.202]  It was a five-hour service.
[00:32:28.242 --> 00:32:29.443]  That's their regular service.
[00:32:29.603 --> 00:32:31.023]  Everything was professional.
[00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:33.463]  The television, the lights, the music.
[00:32:33.803 --> 00:32:35.144]  It was beyond imagination.
[00:32:35.204 --> 00:32:36.644]  My whole team was blown away.
[00:32:36.664 --> 00:32:37.344]  Let's be clear.
[00:32:37.424 --> 00:32:38.724]  And now I've read about that church.
[00:32:38.744 --> 00:32:39.504]  It came from nowhere.
[00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:40.324]  You were there 20 years ago.
[00:32:40.604 --> 00:32:43.445]  It's now the detonator for the total defense of Europe.
[00:32:44.385 --> 00:32:45.486]  This is incredible!
[00:32:45.906 --> 00:32:50.129]  That's right, the resistance to the New World Order is powered by Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:51.069]  The enemy hates it.
[00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:09.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.560]  All right, I'm going to finish up with the big picture.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:42.682]  Then I'm going to drill into what's currently happening and why I've done certain things strategically to try to stop the Globalist.
[00:33:43.842 --> 00:33:47.302]  And the attack profile we ran actually worked.
[00:33:48.623 --> 00:33:52.563]  And I'm going to explain why I'm getting into this, because I'm going to just lay out the next attack profile.
[00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:57.384]  And people say, why would you want to lay out your next plan to try to take down the Globalist fully?
[00:33:58.464 --> 00:33:59.604]  Because I want you to join me.
[00:34:00.585 --> 00:34:02.265]  The enemy already knows their weaknesses.
[00:34:04.913 --> 00:34:07.514]  But if you're going to beat them, you've got to realize what you're up against.
[00:34:08.174 --> 00:34:14.737]  People say, well, if this is really interdimensional, off-world intelligence we're fighting, that's actually demoralizing.
[00:34:14.777 --> 00:34:15.657]  Why not get into it?
[00:34:17.518 --> 00:34:19.299]  Because there's not just evil in the universe.
[00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:26.442]  And the good is God, and is infinity more powerful than the devil.
[00:34:27.443 --> 00:34:42.972]  And this infection we've got, if we make it through this as a planet, as a species together, we're going to look back on beating this like we beat a case of gangrene or hepatitis or something.
[00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:50.937]  We're dealing with basically interdimensional space garbage.
[00:34:52.818 --> 00:34:54.119]  But we are children.
[00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:57.121]  We're embryonic at this point, so we don't know that.
[00:34:59.406 --> 00:35:01.848]  And there are a lot of people impressed with what the devil has to offer.
[00:35:01.868 --> 00:35:04.651]  Because the devil rules this world.
[00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:06.112]  He can give you a lot of stuff.
[00:35:06.653 --> 00:35:09.775]  And so people, low-level, sell out to it right away.
[00:35:12.778 --> 00:35:16.842]  But they're only given power to be slaves on this planet and hurt innocent people.
[00:35:19.264 --> 00:35:24.749]  And they lose the ability to go on to be with God at higher levels of development.
[00:35:26.015 --> 00:35:27.335]  The universe goes in two directions.
[00:35:27.395 --> 00:35:29.996]  It goes into entropy and it goes into higher order.
[00:35:31.437 --> 00:35:32.677]  Entropy and higher order.
[00:35:33.457 --> 00:35:34.238]  Two different directions.
[00:35:36.158 --> 00:35:38.039]  And I want to go into the higher order.
[00:35:38.259 --> 00:35:38.899]  What about you?
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.701]  Now let me get back to when I'm breaking down here.
[00:35:43.221 --> 00:35:46.402]  You have to understand, this was always hiding in plain view.
[00:35:47.535 --> 00:35:57.599]  Hardcore, real Bible-believing Christians know all this, but they see it through interpretations of people hundreds of years ago, thousands of years ago, preachers 200 years ago trying to interpret it.
[00:35:59.919 --> 00:36:09.683]  But if you really pull back and interpret it from what the other agents said as well, this is a continual thread as if there were already other civilizations before.
[00:36:11.488 --> 00:36:18.955]  Or, we were warned about what happened to other civilizations, because there is a race consciousness memory in humans of all of this.
[00:36:19.756 --> 00:36:29.044]  Some could say that's why we're repeating it again, because we've already been through it before, and we're some type of emergency, you know, mission from another place that we destroyed.
[00:36:30.586 --> 00:36:34.910]  And there's a lot of passages in the Bible that actually talk about other creations before this one.
[00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:36.812]  Christ says, I have other flocks.
[00:36:37.952 --> 00:36:44.735]  And if you really study what's in Ezekiel and what's in the other books of the Bible, it's incredible.
[00:36:45.655 --> 00:36:55.138]  And Ezekiel opens with Ezekiel standing there, and it's in the Old Testament 3,000 years ago, and he sees a big giant burning wheel coming out of the sky.
[00:36:56.059 --> 00:36:58.980]  And then it lands and out come floating chariots
[00:37:02.381 --> 00:37:11.486]  With people, with a big bubble, the word they use in Hebrew translates into crystal glass domes over their heads.
[00:37:14.668 --> 00:37:19.210]  That's what the Bible actually says, not what people in medieval times tried to engrave with their interpretation.
[00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:25.394]  Big giant burning wheel landing
[00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:34.893]  A door opens, out comes stairs, and then out floats machines with humanoids with big, giant bubbles over their heads.
[00:37:39.574 --> 00:37:41.834]  And then, they say, eat this.
[00:37:41.914 --> 00:37:43.514]  The angel says, eat this.
[00:37:44.755 --> 00:37:45.855]  Here, take this.
[00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:50.496]  And he takes it, and boy, he gets a big download.
[00:37:52.836 --> 00:37:55.457]  And starts talking for the rest of his life about everything that's gonna happen.
[00:37:57.426 --> 00:38:00.891]  And people start to listen because suddenly this guy knows what's going to happen next week.
[00:38:02.553 --> 00:38:03.995]  This guy knows what's going to happen next year.
[00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:09.182]  At first they don't listen to him, but later they go, this guy knows everything.
[00:38:09.802 --> 00:38:12.907]  And then pretty soon, he's telling you what's going to happen in 3,000 years.
[00:38:15.546 --> 00:38:19.587]  And lo and behold, just what he told us was going to happen in 3,000 years, is happening.
[00:38:19.687 --> 00:38:19.927]  Wow!
[00:38:20.087 --> 00:38:22.087]  I wonder why he got a warning.
[00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.448]  Because there's not just evil in the universe.
[00:38:26.148 --> 00:38:44.811]  Hey, if somebody shows up here and tells you to do this and set up a world government and not be able to buy and sell unless you scan your face and your hand and tells you to put something in your body and there's these giant images projected, holograms, you've got to worship it, and they start going after your family and they put children on top of the parents, get ready because a really bad guy is going to show up and start killing everybody.
[00:38:48.598 --> 00:38:54.202]  You're kind of like, well, that's, you know, somebody hallucinating, you know, in the Middle East 3,000 years ago.
[00:38:55.202 --> 00:38:56.003]  And then it all comes true.
[00:38:57.424 --> 00:39:07.270]  So, whether Ezekiel and John the Revelator and all these people just got lucky, which we know they didn't, doesn't even matter, does it?
[00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.891]  Because we know this is being built right now.
[00:39:11.312 --> 00:39:15.175]  And when you study Ray Kurzweil and all these globalists,
[00:39:16.598 --> 00:39:25.241]  They have these big elite meetings at fancy resorts, the billionaires all go, and they have the Hollywood people there, and they've been let in on all of this.
[00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:29.342]  I'm somebody just reading their writings over 25 years, warning people.
[00:39:31.263 --> 00:39:35.024]  But they go to these meetings, and the one rule is,
[00:39:38.146 --> 00:39:47.729]  Accept world government, accept the destruction of the family, accept transhumanism, that humans are going to merge with machines, and accept that there are too many people and we've got to get rid of a bunch of them.
[00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:52.871]  And then once you've accepted that, you're like an SS officer.
[00:39:53.031 --> 00:39:54.912]  You're ready to kill anybody you're told to.
[00:39:56.073 --> 00:39:58.533]  But it's okay because it's for the Earth.
[00:39:59.894 --> 00:40:05.416]  Oh, because there was another guy, 23, 24 hundred years ago, I forget, named Plato,
[00:40:07.312 --> 00:40:12.975]  The most famous philosopher ever, and everything in his books they've dug up and found to be true, except a few things.
[00:40:17.017 --> 00:40:24.281]  You might want to go find out what those few things are, because it's just exactly what you read about in the Bible, except he's selling it like it's already there.
[00:40:24.801 --> 00:40:30.924]  How Atlantis had the flying cars, and the flying ships, and unlimited energy, and then there was something happened, and it blew up.
[00:40:32.285 --> 00:40:35.647]  And then for many years the sky was dark, which you know happens in a giant explosion.
[00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:39.547]  And there was a little mini ice age, which we know happened.
[00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:46.109]  And then he had his allegory of the cave and all the rest of it.
[00:40:46.249 --> 00:40:55.453]  All I'm telling you is, what you get on the news and what you see and what you're told is all meant to distract you from these larger issues.
[00:40:56.073 --> 00:40:58.674]  And the globalists aren't setting up a world government.
[00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:09.786]  To get rid of the population of humans because we've gotten lazy, we've gotten stupid, we're eating all the resources, we're hurting the Earth.
[00:41:09.986 --> 00:41:11.167]  You could have that sick argument.
[00:41:12.308 --> 00:41:12.488]  No!
[00:41:13.649 --> 00:41:27.558]  The globalists themselves are doing everything they can to the atmosphere and the ocean and their genetic engineering and all of it that in every case fundamentally wounds the infrastructure and the biospheres and the different
[00:41:28.672 --> 00:41:39.235]  Communities of organisms on this planet, and everything they do in the name of environmentalism is to block the fact that they're the ones killing the Earth in a giant moonshousing by proxy.
[00:41:39.275 --> 00:41:40.076]  One of the crew made that point.
[00:41:40.096 --> 00:41:43.677]  It's like mothers that hurt their kids for attention or whatever, like a sacrifice.
[00:41:44.457 --> 00:41:45.417]  And that's what this is.
[00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:50.079]  It's an attempt to kill the planet or irrevocably mutate it and twist it.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:42:05.530]  Because these globalists believe they've got to do this to transcend, and out of this transcension, out of this war, they will become gods.
[00:42:07.171 --> 00:42:14.436]  And again, think about all the billionaires that come out and say, you know, watch out for people that say the AI gods are coming.
[00:42:15.477 --> 00:42:19.160]  Because I've been at the meetings and they're talking about world government exterminating most of the people.
[00:42:20.728 --> 00:42:23.189]  Because that's what you now see Elon Musk and others saying.
[00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:28.150]  And because Elon came out and told you that, suddenly, oh, there's fires at his factories.
[00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.131]  Suddenly, Soros starts trying to short the stock.
[00:42:31.571 --> 00:42:32.931]  Suddenly, he's the bad guy.
[00:42:33.011 --> 00:42:34.932]  Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, you see.
[00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:39.393]  Because he went to the meetings and thought, oh my God, this is all real.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.320]  This is all true.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.602]  You know, people have taken stuff I've said a decade ago and lined it up with what Elon Musk says now.
[00:42:44.802 --> 00:42:45.882]  It's word for word what I'm saying.
[00:42:46.382 --> 00:42:48.623]  But see, it's not because Elon Musk is getting it from me.
[00:42:49.063 --> 00:42:53.225]  He's been to the meetings where this is all being discussed.
[00:42:55.386 --> 00:43:00.648]  So, there is a overt program now to literally destroy humanity.
[00:43:17.825 --> 00:43:28.410]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this limited run shirt that the crew had the idea to do because there's a popular saying on the internet, we're all Alex Jones, don't censor me.
[00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:34.473]  And it's got the Gadsden coiled snake instead of don't tread on me or won't tread on me.
[00:43:34.593 --> 00:43:37.815]  It says, we're all Alex Jones, don't censor me.
[00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:42.336]  It's very soft, nice fabric, black on white t-shirt.
[00:43:42.436 --> 00:43:47.258]  It is absolutely free at InfowarStore.com with any purchase.
[00:43:47.578 --> 00:43:54.140]  That means one tube of toothpaste, fluoride-free, colonel silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, or a water filtration system.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.320]  Or you buy another t-shirt, you get this one free.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.341]  And they're store-wide free shipping.
[00:43:58.861 --> 00:44:03.664]  And there's 50 to 75% off across the board on thousands of items.
[00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:07.426]  50% is the lowest special, 75% is the highest.
[00:44:07.506 --> 00:44:17.512]  We are selling all of our inventory out to go leaner and meaner into the new year because you've seen how Soros and the Globos are trying to shut down InfoWars, trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut us down.
[00:44:17.552 --> 00:44:26.717]  So this way you don't battle the crowds, you don't battle the traffic, you get hands down the best deals we've ever offered on best-selling items that would still probably sell out some of the stuff we've got by
[00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:27.837]  February or so.
[00:44:27.877 --> 00:44:28.077]  No.
[00:44:28.237 --> 00:44:32.578]  I'm selling the entire warehouse right here in Austin, Texas out by the end of this year.
[00:44:32.658 --> 00:44:33.958]  And we're on line to do it.
[00:44:34.058 --> 00:44:35.118]  So everything's for sale.
[00:44:35.278 --> 00:44:36.399]  Some things are about to sell out.
[00:44:36.439 --> 00:44:37.399]  Some things have already sold out.
[00:44:37.439 --> 00:44:39.539]  We still have, I'd say, 90% of our different items.
[00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:43.000]  But in the next few days, obviously, those numbers are going to start going down.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.320]  But right now, it's all there.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.020]  X3, X2, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.081]  But let me say that again.
[00:44:48.121 --> 00:44:52.301]  You get store-wide free shipping, 50-75% off, double Patriot points on your next order.
[00:44:52.401 --> 00:44:55.482]  So instead of 5% on each dollar, you get 10 cents on every dollar.
[00:44:55.502 --> 00:44:56.222]  This is insane.
[00:44:56.762 --> 00:44:58.583]  And this free t-shirt.
[00:44:58.663 --> 00:45:02.084]  Now, they printed 5,000 of these up.
[00:45:02.744 --> 00:45:08.246]  So that means by the end of this week, because Christmas sales are always heavy, these shirts will be sold out.
[00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:09.967]  This is a limited edition.
[00:45:10.547 --> 00:45:11.367]  We're all Alex Jones.
[00:45:11.427 --> 00:45:12.328]  Don't censor me.
[00:45:12.388 --> 00:45:16.789]  And then it'll be a new shirt that will be the free gift that you get with it.
[00:45:16.809 --> 00:45:18.670]  It'll be another one of these great shirts we've got.
[00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.294]  They're all there at InfoWarsTore.com, so you cannot beat this deal.
[00:45:22.314 --> 00:45:27.660]  This is way above even the specials I've been running the last two months that have already been our biggest effort.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.821]  So take advantage of it.
[00:45:28.881 --> 00:45:30.703]  Help us fund ourselves into next year.
[00:45:30.964 --> 00:45:32.665]  Try some of the great products you've never tried.
[00:45:32.806 --> 00:45:34.107]  Try Alphafelder.
[00:45:34.307 --> 00:45:35.529]  Try Rainforce.
[00:45:35.789 --> 00:45:36.490]  Try Edge.
[00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:43.112]  Try Super Male and Super Female Vitality, which is incredibly high quality, cold-pressed herbs, five-star ratings.
[00:45:43.193 --> 00:45:44.353]  We've had it out for four years.
[00:45:44.373 --> 00:45:47.034]  I'm discontinuing because it's so expensive for us to make.
[00:45:47.154 --> 00:45:51.516]  It's so proprietary where we get it from Utah, one of the biggest firms out there, and I'm just done.
[00:45:51.676 --> 00:45:53.416]  That's it for Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[00:45:53.436 --> 00:45:53.937]  It's amazing.
[00:45:54.037 --> 00:45:54.437]  We want it.
[00:45:54.457 --> 00:45:54.817]  It's there.
[00:45:54.957 --> 00:45:56.338]  Alpha Power is organic.
[00:45:56.398 --> 00:45:57.358]  It's a similar formula.
[00:45:57.418 --> 00:45:59.559]  It's even stronger, but it's not cold-pressed.
[00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:02.160]  So some people like Super Male and Super Female Vitality more.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.201]  Alpha Power is amazing, and it costs a fraction of

[00:46:30.914 --> 00:46:33.517]  Please promote our local radio affiliates.
[00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:41.144]  It is so vital that if you're listening to us in California or Texas or New York, however you're listening, remember, you're the only person that can get past the censors.
[00:46:41.865 --> 00:46:48.691]  So tell people about that local radio station, about that local TV station, and tell folks about their local URL as well.
[00:46:49.252 --> 00:46:50.874]  Word of mouth is king in this fight.
[00:47:06.414 --> 00:47:09.056]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:24.574 --> 00:47:28.617]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:47:29.378 --> 00:47:30.839]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:32.220]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.483]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:38.844 --> 00:47:48.311]  I was driving to work this morning, driving into the studios here in Austin, Texas, and I was going to start the broadcast with global governance and the main tenets of it.
[00:47:48.931 --> 00:47:53.875]  Then I went off into what the endgame of global government is once they get control.
[00:47:55.356 --> 00:48:01.959]  Then I was looking at NewsWars.com and also DrudgeReport.com and saw two different articles that tie into this.
[00:48:01.999 --> 00:48:02.619]  Here's one of them.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:15.725]  Alexander Cortez, inevitable global warming governance, that's global governance, will create economic, social and racial justice.
[00:48:16.903 --> 00:48:26.911]  It's inevitable that we can use the transition to 100% renewable energy as a vehicle to truly deliver and establish economic, social, racial justice in the United States of America.
[00:48:27.712 --> 00:48:30.234]  Yeah, Spain went bankrupt with the windmills and all the rest of it.
[00:48:32.136 --> 00:48:38.881]  She's up there with Bernie Sanders and these other, Van Jones, these other horrible, horrible, horrible people.
[00:48:39.202 --> 00:48:43.665]  I'll play that video later when Gary Franchi, great newsman, joins us next hour.
[00:48:45.077 --> 00:48:50.281]  You want a global government, you want a global tax on carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:57.546]  You've got to have water, you've got to have sunshine, you've got to have carbon dioxide, and you've got to have oxygen for life on this planet.
[00:49:00.548 --> 00:49:02.610]  And then if you look at it, they're attacking the atmosphere.
[00:49:04.844 --> 00:49:10.707]  And they're trying to reduce carbon dioxide that's at the lowest ever recorded in the last 500 years.
[00:49:11.627 --> 00:49:17.350]  There's little ups and little downs, but overall, carbon dioxide used to be hundreds of times stronger in the atmosphere.
[00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.891]  Plants grow bigger, stronger.
[00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:21.251]  There's more oxygen.
[00:49:21.351 --> 00:49:22.032]  Humans do well.
[00:49:22.352 --> 00:49:25.873]  The Earth is in an oxygen and carbon dioxide starved state.
[00:49:27.654 --> 00:49:29.435]  In fact, we're losing our atmosphere.
[00:49:30.976 --> 00:49:31.616]  Just like Mars.
[00:49:32.476 --> 00:49:33.917]  And the exact policies
[00:49:35.228 --> 00:49:42.650]  The barium salts, aluminum dioxide, everything else that's going on is to actually destroy our atmosphere.
[00:49:44.391 --> 00:49:57.615]  And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hydrogen bombs were detonated by the United States and others in the high atmosphere and actually blew holes in the atmosphere and caused accelerated off-gassing of our atmosphere.
[00:49:59.761 --> 00:50:04.284]  It was believed by scientists at the time that it might actually ignite and burn the Earth's atmosphere completely.
[00:50:04.684 --> 00:50:05.485]  They still did it.
[00:50:07.586 --> 00:50:12.129]  That's even in Discovery Channel programs like Trinity and Beyond, narrated by William Shatner.
[00:50:12.149 --> 00:50:16.592]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:50:19.994 --> 00:50:28.079]  Children are being taken from their parents if the seven-year-old wants to say they're a girl and they're a boy because the school messed with their brain and taught them to be rebellious.
[00:50:30.168 --> 00:50:32.211]  Mother and father, all over the world is under attack.
[00:50:34.273 --> 00:50:35.615]  Our genetics are under attack.
[00:50:35.675 --> 00:50:36.876]  Our DNA is falling apart.
[00:50:37.096 --> 00:50:38.879]  The 5G, the 4G, the 3G.
[00:50:39.499 --> 00:50:49.632]  The GMO crops are leaking into our genetics and we're seeing every metric showing genetic disorders, cancer, neurological disorders are exploding!
[00:50:57.264 --> 00:51:05.847]  But yet they tell you, don't worry, we're environmentally going to increase the power all over the world and put in government-run 5G to fry you whether you like it or not.
[00:51:05.867 --> 00:51:11.508]  We're going to have lots of TV shows like Better Call Saul that, you know, make fun of the crazy lawyer.
[00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.949]  And you just see this crap everywhere.
[00:51:13.969 --> 00:51:17.830]  Because the crazy lawyer thinks he's sick from Wi-Fi.
[00:51:19.891 --> 00:51:21.371]  It doesn't matter how many studies there are.
[00:51:21.391 --> 00:51:22.452]  It doesn't matter what the facts are.
[00:51:22.472 --> 00:51:24.933]  It doesn't matter if Harvard admits in 25 studies that
[00:51:27.063 --> 00:51:35.665]  One part per million of sodium fluoride in the water causes massive birth defects, increased cancer, and a 15 point IQ reduction.
[00:51:38.306 --> 00:51:40.666]  Even Wired admits it.
[00:51:40.686 --> 00:51:42.606]  5G smartphones are causing cancer.
[00:51:43.607 --> 00:51:45.387]  But big tech doesn't want you to know about it.
[00:51:48.768 --> 00:51:53.889]  But the globalists from Japan to the United States are buying extremely rural
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:06.846]  Far away places and actually are now passing laws or incorporating or putting up huge fences where no wireless is allowed and then they're actually relocating to those.
[00:52:08.607 --> 00:52:12.789]  You know, then they always spin it and say, Alex Jones is a troglodyte.
[00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:14.270]  He's afraid of technology.
[00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:14.990]  No, I'm not.
[00:52:16.111 --> 00:52:17.032]  I'm always an early adopter.
[00:52:19.893 --> 00:52:23.075]  Jones is afraid of technology.
[00:52:23.115 --> 00:52:23.395]  No, I'm not.
[00:52:25.037 --> 00:52:26.017]  I know what's going on here.
[00:52:28.298 --> 00:52:35.299]  These technologies are Trojan horses for social control and population reduction and they admit they are.
[00:52:36.179 --> 00:52:38.920]  It's like when they say Jones doesn't believe in vaccines.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.020]  Now I know you can have learned immunity.
[00:52:43.601 --> 00:52:50.262]  I know the whole history of immunization for 600 years starting in England for smallpox.
[00:52:52.321 --> 00:52:56.124]  And I know the doctors told you back then it could kill you, but some people opted to do it.
[00:52:57.786 --> 00:53:15.662]  But the inserts admit, on all the vaccines they can kill you, give you all these different neurological disorders, read them for yourself, but the nightly news will tell you nobody ever gets hurt, even though when I'm looking at local news all the time, people are dying, people are paralyzed, from the Gardasil, the flu shot, there's a bunch of articles out today about it.
[00:53:17.875 --> 00:53:19.136]  There's one on fullwords.com.
[00:53:19.176 --> 00:53:21.016]  Man unable to speak, walk, see, or breathe.
[00:53:21.397 --> 00:53:22.297]  He's ever getting flu shot.
[00:53:22.477 --> 00:53:23.518]  Total Guillain-Barré.
[00:53:23.838 --> 00:53:25.819]  Total shutdown of the neurological system.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.280]  The central nervous system.
[00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:32.422]  Hey, but he did what he was told.
[00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:35.223]  He went into Walgreens and rolled up a sleeve.
[00:53:36.303 --> 00:53:43.407]  Even though the flu shots never, ever worked.
[00:53:43.427 --> 00:53:44.447]  It's not designed to.
[00:53:45.228 --> 00:53:46.208]  You see, it's a carrier.
[00:53:48.697 --> 00:54:01.624]  But metaphysically, they need you to go opt into it, so they see it as they're not committing a war crime like they did when they would tell black folks, oh, it's a vaccine, they're really giving them syphilis for 47 years.
[00:54:02.164 --> 00:54:18.133]  And it wasn't until a few whistleblowers went public, they would still be giving black people and poor white Appalachians in Kentucky and other areas syphilis, and then letting them spread it, and letting them die horrible, tortured deaths as microscopic worms eat your brain.
[00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:29.102]  Instead we're supposed to watch the political establishment in what, five different ceremonies now for Herbert Walker Bush?
[00:54:34.765 --> 00:54:43.770]  And watch him wrapped in the American flag when he worked steadfastly against this country from the time he got out of the Navy in World War II until the time he died.
[00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:51.533]  These are the social climbing political hacks that love to think of themselves as powerful and cool.
[00:54:51.973 --> 00:54:54.794]  These are the people that have worked to destroy this nation.
[00:54:55.815 --> 00:54:57.375]  Almost all of them, in attendance.
[00:54:57.796 --> 00:54:59.737]  Those are the enemies of America right there.
[00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:01.377]  They're the problem.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.001]  But there is a larger spiritual problem.
[00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:10.442]  The Bible calls it the mystery of evil.
[00:55:11.242 --> 00:55:11.862]  It's a wavelength.
[00:55:11.922 --> 00:55:12.563]  It's an internet.
[00:55:13.203 --> 00:55:15.064]  It's a broadcast of evil
[00:55:17.566 --> 00:55:35.271]  Inclination of a reservoir empowering those, incentivizing, giving them that light bulb of ideas to carry out this thing they're building.
[00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:39.092]  And it's not taking us to a good place, we already know that.
[00:55:40.852 --> 00:55:41.492]  And it's real.
[00:55:42.433 --> 00:55:43.073]  And it's happening.
[00:55:44.318 --> 00:55:50.980]  And the censorship's here, and the attacks on our families is here, and it's the final war, not tanks and armies coming over the hill to get you.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.681]  You can organize against that to fight.
[00:55:53.081 --> 00:56:05.645]  No, no, it's just attacking your family, attacking your children, attacking your bank account, attacking your health, attacking your right to speech, attacking everything you hold dear, doing everything it can to get you out of the countryside,
[00:56:06.858 --> 00:56:21.069]  Out of knowing how to skin a buck or run a trot line, out of going to the little church, into the establishment arms of the system of conformity, when the conformity is giving in to an anti-human, post-human world.
[00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:34.239]  You're either with the humans, or you're against the humans, because whether it's the devil, or whether it's just some weird thing in a certain percentage of people that are psychotic, they try to build systems like this, whatever it is that's running this,
[00:56:37.025 --> 00:56:47.975]  From a military perspective, you would say it's a off-world entity who went and made deals with the ruling class to set up systems to dumb down and poison and slowly kill the population.
[00:56:48.135 --> 00:56:55.261]  And then you read what the globals are doing, it's exactly that, and they say, we're in rituals where these entities tell us to do this.
[00:56:57.023 --> 00:57:03.508]  Whether it's George Herbert Walker Bush, when they get in that coffin, they believe that the goddess Eulogia comes to them.
[00:57:04.491 --> 00:57:05.952]  And tells them what it is they've got to do.
[00:57:05.972 --> 00:57:07.193]  And then the devil comes to them.
[00:57:08.374 --> 00:57:09.415]  And tells them what they've got to do.
[00:57:09.676 --> 00:57:18.023]  And all these people, in every case, when you study them, when they're not in a church acting like they're Christian, they're channeling evil spirits.
[00:57:18.543 --> 00:57:21.566]  Now, let's say I'm like a sociologist.
[00:57:22.647 --> 00:57:23.487]  Or an anthropologist.
[00:57:24.288 --> 00:57:27.571]  You don't have to believe in all this to know there are pygmies that shrink people's heads.
[00:57:28.231 --> 00:57:29.553]  Or the Aztecs cut people's hearts out.
[00:57:30.293 --> 00:57:32.055]  Or that Jeffrey Dahmer grabbed kids and, you know,
[00:57:34.045 --> 00:57:35.105]  Cut them up and put them in the refrigerator.
[00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:36.566]  This is going on.
[00:57:36.646 --> 00:57:46.289]  The ruling elite believe that they are divinely inspired and are become gods, but first they gotta kill everybody and destroy their own planet.
[00:57:46.989 --> 00:57:48.429]  Sounds like they bought a bill of goods.
[00:57:48.469 --> 00:57:49.010]  What do you think?
[00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.990]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:53.599 --> 00:58:01.622]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[00:58:01.942 --> 00:58:13.066]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.

[00:58:31.233 --> 00:58:38.256]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the new world order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty and trying to shut down the free press is.

[00:59:30.086 --> 00:59:32.768]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:41.772]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfoWarsStore.com is the last run, 55% off, of Super Male and Super Female Lethality.
[00:59:41.852 --> 00:59:45.794]  It's hard to procure it anymore, so we're discontinuing it even though it's a bestseller at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:46.494 --> 00:59:49.875]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible.
[00:59:50.235 --> 00:59:52.176]  Again, you are the resistance.
[00:59:54.436 --> 01:00:00.338]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.188 --> 01:00:18.093]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:37.128 --> 01:00:42.109]  All right, Gary Franchi, a really smart cookie, is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment to cover the waterfront.
[01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:50.352]  We're going to get into what's happening in Europe and Macron caving in to the Nationalists saying you're not going to get your carbon tax.
[01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:53.993]  You've got the war on nation states by the big banks trying to plunge the stock market.
[01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:57.074]  With the stock market down almost 1,500 points last time I checked.
[01:00:57.514 --> 01:00:59.214]  Latest numbers up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:00.054 --> 01:01:00.735]  It's all coming up.
[01:01:02.235 --> 01:01:05.336]  But I did the whole last hour and didn't plug
[01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:08.137]  A product or anything we're selling.
[01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.998]  And you know, other talk show hosts plug every segment.
[01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:11.878]  And I know why they do.
[01:01:12.678 --> 01:01:15.539]  People really pay attention during the segments, not so much the commercials.
[01:01:16.419 --> 01:01:20.080]  So whether you're watching Fox News or CNN, there's product placement going on.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.321]  Usually not overtly, but it's going on during the so-called news piece.
[01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:27.821]  With us, everything is right on our sleeve.
[01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:29.081]  We're totally clear about it.
[01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:33.322]  We're here because you've stood with us.
[01:01:34.843 --> 01:01:36.643]  And it's been amazing.
[01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:42.187]  And because of what you've done as an audience, we've changed the world.
[01:01:45.229 --> 01:01:50.552]  We fundamentally expose globalism as this planetary world government authoritarian system.
[01:01:53.554 --> 01:01:54.714]  And so they denied it existed.
[01:01:55.295 --> 01:02:00.858]  But now they're out in the open admitting it exists because they were unsuccessful in stopping a debate about it.
[01:02:01.823 --> 01:02:09.430]  So now they've just moved directly to total censorship of any nationalist, of any Christian, of any conservative that exposes the scam that they're involved in.
[01:02:11.412 --> 01:02:26.546]  And there's a clip up on DrudgeReport.com where Alexander Cortez says it's inevitable that global warming governance, a global governance of global warming, tracking everything you do, will create economic, social, and racial justice.
[01:02:28.019 --> 01:02:33.220]  So that's these big carbon exchanges owned by Al Gore and Laura Rothschild and Barack Obama.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.460]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:02:36.161 --> 01:02:39.521]  Being paid by everybody that engages in any human activity.
[01:02:40.361 --> 01:02:41.101]  Everything's taxed.
[01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:41.541]  Everything.
[01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:43.522]  Being born is taxed.
[01:02:44.202 --> 01:02:55.004]  And you pay this new superclass of Bernie Sanders types to fly around on their private jets while they tell you they're saving the Earth and saving the atmosphere
[01:02:57.827 --> 01:02:58.789]  With all these taxes.
[01:03:01.293 --> 01:03:08.265]  While they're carrying out geoengineering operations that actually could collapse the atmosphere, all the scientists that have looked at it say.
[01:03:11.092 --> 01:03:12.533]  So, they're collapsing it.
[01:03:12.553 --> 01:03:17.454]  They're going to bring the taxes in and then later say, oh, we acted too little too late.
[01:03:18.154 --> 01:03:19.975]  You can see the whole diabolical plan.
[01:03:20.315 --> 01:03:23.556]  Mike Adams has written a masterstroke report that everyone should read.
[01:03:24.016 --> 01:03:25.777]  It's at naturalnews.com and infowars.com.
[01:03:25.857 --> 01:03:28.658]  I'm going to have it reposted to the top of infowars.com.
[01:03:29.298 --> 01:03:30.879]  Terraforming has begun.
[01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:40.502]  Global dimming is a plot to exterminate humanity by terraforming the atmosphere with smog pollution, killing Earth's food crops and unleashing ecological collapse.
[01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:46.428]  This is reality, and I'm begging you to get the report and get out to everyone you know.
[01:03:46.749 --> 01:03:54.414]  That said, it is your purchase of the products at InfoWareStore.com that make all this possible.
[01:03:55.955 --> 01:04:04.261]  And so now, until the 19th of December, everyone that orders in the continental United States is guaranteed to get it, their package, before Christmas.

[01:04:15.172 --> 01:04:19.655]  It's a big deal.
[01:04:22.256 --> 01:04:33.942]  And, quite frankly, a lot of those are products that we're losing money on because we need to clear out the warehouse.
[01:04:33.962 --> 01:04:36.123]  We don't have to pay inventory tax on it.
[01:04:36.143 --> 01:04:39.265]  So take advantage of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of products.
[01:04:39.345 --> 01:04:40.225]  Everything is on sale.

[01:04:43.487 --> 01:04:46.088]  We're calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.

[01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:49.229]  I know you know that.
[01:04:49.249 --> 01:04:54.611]  So I also wanted to thank you all for your support in making the InfoWar possible.
[01:04:54.631 --> 01:04:58.573]  The 12 days of Christmas are running through right up until the 19th.
[01:04:58.993 --> 01:05:00.293]  Please take advantage of it.
[01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:01.454]  Without you, we will be shut down.
[01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:12.015]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:05:12.235 --> 01:05:13.455]  Believe me, I know.
[01:05:13.475 --> 01:05:18.016]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:23.438]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[01:05:23.698 --> 01:05:43.924]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:05:44.424 --> 01:05:48.187]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:05:48.448 --> 01:05:51.870]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:56.654]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:05:57.175 --> 01:05:59.197]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:05:59.897 --> 01:06:02.820]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.374]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:46.164 --> 01:06:53.090]  Hard to believe I've known the fellow who's going to ride shotgun with us in this hour for 14-15 years, Gary Franchi.
[01:06:54.231 --> 01:07:01.938]  Up in Chicago, he founded the Lone Lantern Society, one-eth by land, two-eth by sea, and he has had a syndicated radio and TV show for many, many years.
[01:07:02.378 --> 01:07:04.740]  It's reached hundreds of millions of people just on YouTube alone.
[01:07:05.281 --> 01:07:08.644]  Next News Network at Gary Franchi on Twitter.
[01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:09.965]  Now,
[01:07:14.474 --> 01:07:22.422]  I want to talk to him about how far we've come, because there's a lot of what you could call depressing news out there.
[01:07:23.303 --> 01:07:24.925]  A lot of really crazy things that are going on.
[01:07:24.985 --> 01:07:37.498]  But if you go back to people like Larry McDonald and Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan 40, 50 years ago talking about One World God Breath, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.922]  And the plan for world government, I mean, they would say you were crazy, it didn't exist.
[01:07:43.442 --> 01:08:02.672]  Well, now it's out in the open, and now in every country that's had elections in the last six and a half years, every country, in hundreds of elections, except for two, Venezuela's election and our midterm we just had, which there's fraud in both, obviously.
[01:08:03.293 --> 01:08:05.053]  We have the evidence, we caught them all over stealing.
[01:08:05.434 --> 01:08:07.635]  But everywhere you have a quasi-fair election,
[01:08:09.093 --> 01:08:15.836]  From Brazil to Spain, from Italy to Reykjavik, Iceland to the UK, to just everywhere, to Germany.
[01:08:16.016 --> 01:08:17.057]  Merkel's still in this.
[01:08:17.997 --> 01:08:19.838]  Chancellor, but her party's lost total power.
[01:08:20.398 --> 01:08:21.138]  That's how it works there.
[01:08:21.158 --> 01:08:21.719]  She's still in.
[01:08:21.739 --> 01:08:23.319]  They haven't done the no-confidence vote.
[01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.201]  She should step down, but she can still stay in for another year if she wants.
[01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:28.282]  Everywhere they're failing.
[01:08:30.443 --> 01:08:33.004]  And now another huge example of that is Macron.
[01:08:34.434 --> 01:08:38.877]  Macron submits to Yellow Vest Rebellion, cancels fuel tax hike indefinitely.
[01:08:39.818 --> 01:08:47.083]  It was the equivalent of a dollar plus hike over their five and a half dollar, if you translate it into the euro, leader cost.
[01:08:49.465 --> 01:09:03.815]  In a country that's already the highest taxed in the world, and the OECD, that's this Organization of Economic Co-operative Development, that was basically the Marshall Plan in World War II, it's the core of the world government, it recommends the whole world adopt France-style taxes.
[01:09:05.592 --> 01:09:06.913]  And flood their countries with Islamics.
[01:09:08.134 --> 01:09:12.296]  But the media tried to spin this the last week or so, saying, oh, they just are mad about the gas tax.
[01:09:12.376 --> 01:09:18.220]  No, they're mad about globalism, open borders, political correctness, and now they're having rallies to that.
[01:09:18.641 --> 01:09:20.081]  So first, Macron said they'd never give up.
[01:09:20.502 --> 01:09:23.444]  They're going to force the tax, pay it to Al Gore and Rothschild, literally.
[01:09:23.464 --> 01:09:24.544]  That's who pays.
[01:09:25.325 --> 01:09:25.785]  You pay to them.
[01:09:27.466 --> 01:09:28.167]  First they said that.
[01:09:29.367 --> 01:09:31.389]  Then they said, OK, now we permanently are cancelling it.
[01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.316]  But now they're saying, no, we're done with the political correctness.
[01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:37.737]  And we're done with you trying to tell five-year-old boys they're really girls and vice versa.
[01:09:38.057 --> 01:09:43.519]  And so you're learning that they tried to misbrand this as just a bunch of people angry in yellow vests about taxes.
[01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.961]  They're angry about the whole New World Order, EU, you name it.
[01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:51.962]  And Macron has gone from a 50% approval rating to a 20 to 25% approval rating.
[01:09:51.982 --> 01:09:54.824]  So this is just more examples of all of this.
[01:09:55.124 --> 01:10:00.866]  But meanwhile, Alexandra Cortez says inevitable global warming governance over the planet
[01:10:01.266 --> 01:10:03.808]  We'll create economic justice, racial justice.
[01:10:05.429 --> 01:10:06.390]  So this is their whole plan.
[01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:11.333]  Gary, it's so exciting to see humanity waking up.
[01:10:11.534 --> 01:10:13.155]  What would you say about this?
[01:10:13.215 --> 01:10:16.337]  And what would you call this period of history we're in?
[01:10:17.938 --> 01:10:20.380]  Well, I think this is the revolt against the New World Order.
[01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:23.883]  You know, years ago, they said they were losing the information war.
[01:10:23.923 --> 01:10:26.385]  You saw Hillary even bring it up.
[01:10:26.465 --> 01:10:29.547]  You saw Brzezinski talk about it years ago.
[01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:35.130]  They knew that there was an information war taking place, so they decided to fight against it.
[01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:36.791]  And they've been doing that for some time.
[01:10:36.811 --> 01:10:46.441]  But I think what's interesting to note too, and something that should be brought up about what Kerry and Hillary just recently said in Europe, is that they are concerned about this new populist uprising.
[01:10:47.021 --> 01:10:50.745]  And that is a direct result of the open borders policies in Europe.
[01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:53.106]  So now they're backpedaling.
[01:10:53.126 --> 01:10:57.630]  They're saying, oh well, you know, Europe is starting to fall apart, but be careful.
[01:10:58.431 --> 01:11:06.617]  We can't let all these borders wide open because it's going to create the counter-pressure, the counter-reaction to their policies, which is populism.
[01:11:06.818 --> 01:11:08.059]  And that's what they're seeing in Paris.
[01:11:08.299 --> 01:11:12.222]  That's what's happening in the United States as President Trump reinforces the borders.
[01:11:12.462 --> 01:11:15.545]  And Pelosi says, no, we're going to back off on those immigration policies.
[01:11:16.346 --> 01:11:17.750]  Our immigration policies are better.
[01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.273]  We're stronger than the Republicans.
[01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:20.857]  But it's a complete lie.
[01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:21.479]  It's a farce.
[01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:29.774]  On the populist, you have this massive populist uprising all across the world, and they're absolutely terrified of it.
[01:11:30.234 --> 01:11:31.495]  I mean, look what's happening in Paris.
[01:11:31.675 --> 01:11:32.716]  The streets are burning.
[01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:43.044]  They're pushing back against this green agenda, and as you just mentioned, you know, Ocasio-Cortez is telling everybody that we're going to have this utopian, you know, green society.
[01:11:43.584 --> 01:11:52.471]  I think it's, if anything, you know, they're so worried about, you know, carbon dioxide, maybe they should all just hold their breath for about 30 minutes, and I think the rest of us would be okay.
[01:11:53.137 --> 01:11:55.759]  Gary Franci of Next News Network's our guest for the hour.
[01:11:56.619 --> 01:12:00.682]  Gary, I'm glad you raised Hillary because notice she said what Bill Gates said six months ago.
[01:12:01.323 --> 01:12:06.686]  Six months ago Bill Gates, who she takes her orders from, said, Europe needs to slow down the open borders.
[01:12:06.806 --> 01:12:09.248]  It's woken up the nationalists and the populists to our plan.
[01:12:11.019 --> 01:12:17.670]  Then Hillary, as you know, last week said you need to slow it down because you've awoken the nationalists.
[01:12:18.311 --> 01:12:22.898]  There are literally, it's now admitted, thousands of no-go zones per country.
[01:12:24.155 --> 01:12:27.677]  We're whole areas of cities, no running water because plumbers won't go in.
[01:12:28.298 --> 01:12:31.319]  It just, where the Islamists take over, just recedes back to Stone Age.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.561]  When the power goes out, they don't fix it anymore.
[01:12:34.982 --> 01:12:37.523]  When fires start, the firefighters can't go into the areas.
[01:12:38.404 --> 01:12:40.625]  There's no mail delivery because they will kill you.
[01:12:41.626 --> 01:12:51.952]  They will throw hand grenades at you, and I've got a bunch of articles along those lines where this is happening, and it's just wild that they would try something like this.
[01:12:54.409 --> 01:12:55.090]  Well, they need to.
[01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:58.033]  They need to continue to open up the borders.
[01:13:00.115 --> 01:13:13.969]  It's really sad when they talk about diversity and that being a strength, when in reality, it breaks down the actual pure culture of those countries, and then those countries, they lose their actual identities.
[01:13:14.853 --> 01:13:16.794]  And that breaks my heart.
[01:13:18.315 --> 01:13:23.098]  My family is from Italy, and I'm like second generation Italian, half Italian.
[01:13:23.758 --> 01:13:32.163]  And to watch these migrant hordes coming in from North Africa, completely destroying the fabric of Italian culture,
[01:13:33.377 --> 01:13:33.758]  It's sad.
[01:13:33.998 --> 01:13:35.460]  It's a sad state of affairs.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.702]  But let's expand on that.
[01:13:36.782 --> 01:13:45.234]  When Japanese or Irish or Italian or Russian immigrants or Greek immigrants came to the U.S.
[01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:45.654]  in the past,
[01:13:47.059 --> 01:13:52.745]  We got all the good stuff, the literature, the food, everything else, but people adopted the Americana culture because that's what they wanted.
[01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:53.186]  Exactly.
[01:13:54.027 --> 01:14:08.862]  But now, people coming from the third world would do that too if they weren't immediately met at the airport with, everything's free, have an anchor baby, America sucks, we're taking down the American flags, communism's great, your congresswoman is Alexandra Cortez, and
[01:14:09.898 --> 01:14:18.748]  So again, they're bringing them in as not just a replacement group, but literally as a bunch of arrogant, America-hating people.
[01:14:18.768 --> 01:14:20.290]  I mean, that's the fact of what's happened.
[01:14:21.671 --> 01:14:27.377]  Well, remember the film Gangs of New York, when the immigrants were coming off of the boats?
[01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:30.802]  And they would hand them a card and a piece of bread said, vote Tammany.
[01:14:31.202 --> 01:14:45.807]  It's the same exact thing that's happening now that was happening then, is that they make these big promises, we're gonna give you food, we're gonna give you shelter, we're gonna give you Walmart gift cards, we're gonna give you free condos, you can do whatever you want.
[01:14:46.576 --> 01:14:47.917]  Just make sure you vote Democrat.
[01:14:48.237 --> 01:14:52.920]  And that goes back to the concept that the Democrats' ideas are failing.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:59.004]  They're failing at such a scale, the American people are waking up and they're saying, no, we're not going to vote for these things.
[01:14:59.044 --> 01:15:01.485]  These things are against the American way.
[01:15:02.046 --> 01:15:04.207]  So they have to import the votes.
[01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:05.428]  It's terrifying.
[01:15:05.648 --> 01:15:15.634]  Now, when my family came here, Alex, when my family came here, they vowed that they would not teach the generation after them the Italian language, the Italian culture.
[01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:25.981]  You know, I have a disconnect from my Italian heritage that I can only really pick up from the stereotypes in Hollywood films, which is kind of just depressing.
[01:15:27.438 --> 01:15:30.320]  But that's what that generation decided to do.
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:39.945]  And now what we're seeing is this immigration, these immigration policies, and then they're isolating people into groups where they go ahead and reinforce their own stereotypes.
[01:15:40.325 --> 01:15:40.765]  That's key.
[01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:41.205]  Stay there.
[01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:42.646]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:15:42.726 --> 01:15:44.567]  And let's expand on this.
[01:15:44.967 --> 01:15:45.888]  If I moved to Italy,
[01:15:46.468 --> 01:15:47.389]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[01:15:47.549 --> 01:15:48.229]  I wanna rock!
[01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:21.909]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[01:16:21.929 --> 01:16:28.313]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:38.305]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[01:16:39.506 --> 01:16:41.787]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[01:16:42.007 --> 01:16:43.568]  I could end this guy, John, tomorrow.
[01:16:43.689 --> 01:16:46.110]  All you gotta do is arm all your passengers.
[01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:54.756]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[01:16:54.896 --> 01:16:55.556]  Where's the beef?
[01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:57.858]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[01:16:59.011 --> 01:17:01.793]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[01:17:01.853 --> 01:17:10.360]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:15.904]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[01:17:16.385 --> 01:17:21.529]  And, in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:39.645]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[01:17:39.885 --> 01:17:46.489]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:47.950]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[01:17:48.191 --> 01:17:52.836]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[01:17:52.956 --> 01:17:57.582]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:03.170]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:07.633]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[01:18:07.673 --> 01:18:10.475]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[01:18:10.535 --> 01:18:18.060]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:22.683]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[01:18:22.983 --> 01:18:28.307]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[01:18:29.367 --> 01:18:30.508]  I'm scared of these people.
[01:18:31.228 --> 01:18:34.609]  I'm very scared of them.
[01:18:38.671 --> 01:18:40.652]  How do you think the crack drug gets into the country?
[01:18:40.692 --> 01:18:42.092]  We don't own any planes.
[01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:43.633]  We don't own no ships.
[01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:47.234]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:54.157]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[01:18:56.495 --> 01:19:03.899]  Men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[01:19:03.919 --> 01:19:08.702]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[01:19:08.742 --> 01:19:15.826]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[01:19:16.266 --> 01:19:23.090]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-controvers
[01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:28.853]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:35.556]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[01:19:36.137 --> 01:19:41.139]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[01:19:41.339 --> 01:19:44.521]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:47.703]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[01:19:48.423 --> 01:19:52.665]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[01:19:52.725 --> 01:19:53.005]  Lewinsky.
[01:19:53.626 --> 01:19:55.487]  These allegations are false.
[01:19:56.827 --> 01:20:02.330]  If you are resuming this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[01:20:06.952 --> 01:20:09.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:21.133]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:20:21.693 --> 01:20:23.214]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.996 --> 01:20:31.258]  Alright.
[01:20:31.758 --> 01:20:38.042]  When I'm sitting around at night thinking about the state of the world,
[01:20:41.241 --> 01:20:45.825]  It makes me feel really good to know people like Gary Franchi and Mark Dice and Matt Drudge and so many others are out there.
[01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:57.553]  And last night I was thinking about Gary coming on the show, and I just wanted to ask him this question before we get back into the globalist invasion and his grade on Trump and then getting into George Herbert Walker Bush's funeral.
[01:20:57.573 --> 01:21:01.236]  I know he's a big critic of the Skull and Bonesers, like I am.
[01:21:02.037 --> 01:21:04.779]  And then the plunging stock market and how the globalists are going to strike back.
[01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:07.821]  Because we're having some victories, but let's not be overly positive here.
[01:21:08.201 --> 01:21:10.203]  They've got ways to strike back, obviously, as we're seeing.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:18.946]  I think it's important almost at the start of every hour to make this statement on radio and TV and a few places we aren't censored on the internet.
[01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:28.493]  InfoWars has been targeted because we're effective and we told the truth.
[01:21:29.834 --> 01:21:33.537]  And so it's a badge of honor that we've become public enemy number one after Trump.
[01:21:35.319 --> 01:21:38.461]  But if you know what they fear, you know what can bring them down.
[01:21:38.802 --> 01:21:41.424]  And so that's why InfoWars is such a teachable moment.
[01:21:42.563 --> 01:21:43.884]  A teachable millennium.
[01:21:43.904 --> 01:21:47.246]  Because so many people walk up to me on the street and they go, man, how you taking it?
[01:21:47.267 --> 01:21:48.307]  We really feel sorry for you.
[01:21:48.648 --> 01:21:49.588]  Are you still on the air?
[01:21:49.628 --> 01:21:55.352]  And I'm like, yeah, on hundreds of radio stations, hundreds of TV stations, newswars.com, infowars.com.
[01:21:55.392 --> 01:21:58.755]  Our audience is way bigger on core people coming to our platforms.
[01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:04.179]  But we have had our reach cut off to new people, and that's the most important group.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.702]  So it isn't about, oh, did you hear about Alex Jones?
[01:22:08.722 --> 01:22:09.623]  But see, that's how they do it.
[01:22:09.943 --> 01:22:10.544]  They take our
[01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:14.825]  Folk hero grassroots victory of our listeners.
[01:22:15.105 --> 01:22:15.926]  You're the folk heroes.
[01:22:16.026 --> 01:22:16.847]  People like Gary Franchi.
[01:22:16.887 --> 01:22:17.448]  All of us together.
[01:22:18.409 --> 01:22:23.735]  Fighting back against megacorporations allied with the Chi-Coms and the Rockefellers and the big banks.
[01:22:25.016 --> 01:22:27.119]  Getting nationalists elected everywhere!
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.244]  And carbon taxes being defeated in France!
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.861]  And all this other Brexit!
[01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:35.643]  And sure, they're trying to derail that.
[01:22:35.663 --> 01:22:38.705]  They're gonna fight back, but that only pisses people off more!
[01:22:39.045 --> 01:22:40.546]  When we voted to do this, you won't do it!
[01:22:40.867 --> 01:22:42.348]  The point is, we're in the fight now.
[01:22:43.289 --> 01:22:46.571]  So don't think, oh, Infowars lost.
[01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:48.052]  See, Hillary Clinton lost.
[01:22:48.533 --> 01:22:49.654]  The globalists lost.
[01:22:51.075 --> 01:22:52.095]  Humanity woke up.
[01:22:52.175 --> 01:22:58.697]  So don't let them turn it into this thing of, oh, Jones is getting sued and Jones got taken off the air and yeah, you see what happens when you stand up.
[01:22:59.098 --> 01:23:00.878]  You know, I'm gonna be a smart talk show host.
[01:23:01.278 --> 01:23:04.639]  I'm gonna, you know, stick with the line and say we should have open borders.
[01:23:04.659 --> 01:23:09.381]  I mean, I know so-called conservatives now that are toeing the line because they saw what happened to me.
[01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:12.482]  That's a recipe to lose the whole country.
[01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:14.162]  Gary, look at the big layoffs.
[01:23:15.483 --> 01:23:18.844]  At all the leftist publications that called for us to be censored.
[01:23:20.504 --> 01:23:25.526]  All the different globalist operations, from Vox to you name it, to BuzzFeed.
[01:23:26.887 --> 01:23:39.391]  And that's what's crazy about this, is these leftists are collaborators with the globalists, even though they're the first people that get fired and shut down once the globalists are done with their operation.
[01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:39.972]  It's just crazy.
[01:23:40.012 --> 01:23:45.574]  I know I've digressed off into who's winning and who's losing, and I'm not just trying to sit here and declare who's winning and who's losing.
[01:23:45.914 --> 01:23:48.175]  I got into this as an underdog just like you decades ago.
[01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:50.012]  It's not about me.
[01:23:50.413 --> 01:23:59.178]  But then I realized the perception in the public is they sell that nationalism's losing, and Trump's losing, and Infowars is losing, but that's not the case.
[01:23:59.579 --> 01:24:05.722]  We're winning by bringing sovereignty and people power and controlling our own governments back.
[01:24:05.802 --> 01:24:06.663]  That's essential.
[01:24:06.903 --> 01:24:08.324]  We're soldiers in this fight.
[01:24:08.524 --> 01:24:12.947]  We're not sociopaths like Hollywood mercenaries who'll just say anything for money.
[01:24:13.187 --> 01:24:13.848]  And so if I
[01:24:14.668 --> 01:24:19.015]  You know, get censored, or if I lose some money, or something like that happens, I'm a loser.
[01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:20.537]  I'm not a loser, I'm a winner.
[01:24:20.757 --> 01:24:22.981]  And it's not about me thumping my chest saying, I'm a winner.
[01:24:23.782 --> 01:24:27.527]  It's about explaining to the listeners and viewers the psyop they're running.
[01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:28.409]  Can you comment on that?
[01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:39.937]  Well, I think you bring up a point about how these leftist organizations are laying off people, but I just did a report yesterday on Bill Kristol, the neocon, his weekly standard.
[01:24:40.357 --> 01:24:41.959]  It looks like that's going down.
[01:24:42.479 --> 01:24:49.564]  And that's because he is a representative of the establishment elite that did not listen to the voters.
[01:24:50.024 --> 01:24:55.288]  Now, of course, you know, Bill Kristol, he was one of the lead architects of PNAC.
[01:24:55.348 --> 01:24:56.428]  We can go down that road.
[01:24:57.269 --> 01:25:06.795]  But he did not listen to the people, to the population, who voted for President Trump, along with all the other neocons, who are all basically part of the same party.
[01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:14.020]  They're all the establishment that are working against the people for the globalist agenda, so that they can turn the United States into a third world despot.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:18.483]  That's the ultimate goal, but the American people push back on that, and when you have
[01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:20.090]  We're good to go.
[01:25:34.742 --> 01:25:39.166]  Every single time the left-wing media goes ahead and tries to fight us, what happens?
[01:25:39.527 --> 01:25:40.888]  We only get stronger.
[01:25:41.349 --> 01:25:44.011]  And that's because the American people see through the facade.
[01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:45.833]  See, they think the American people are stupid.
[01:25:46.053 --> 01:25:49.977]  Mazzie Hirono just said, oh yeah, we're smarter than our constituents.
[01:25:50.237 --> 01:25:51.659]  Remember, she said these things.
[01:25:51.979 --> 01:25:52.760]  This is what they do.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.822]  They look down upon the American people.
[01:25:55.342 --> 01:25:56.303]  And that's their downfall.
[01:25:56.323 --> 01:26:06.168]  They look down on us, they don't listen to us, they go ahead with what they think is the best for the world, the globalist society, but at the same time, the American people can recognize this.
[01:26:06.448 --> 01:26:15.733]  The American people see through it, but they're so drunk on their own Kool-Aid that they are dying from the strychnine that they put in it!
[01:26:16.594 --> 01:26:18.275]  And that's what's happening right now, Alex.
[01:26:19.748 --> 01:26:21.310]  In fact, I'm glad you mentioned her.
[01:26:21.570 --> 01:26:22.651]  I meant to play that yesterday.
[01:26:22.672 --> 01:26:23.673]  I'm sure you played it on your show.
[01:26:24.534 --> 01:26:34.405]  Let's play that when we come back, where this congresswoman from Hawaii says Democrats are too smart and their constituents are too dumb, which is just asinine.
[01:26:34.525 --> 01:26:39.470]  And then she's the same one that said, if you're a man, a white man, just sit down and shut up.
[01:26:40.231 --> 01:26:44.753]  That is the most KKK-ish thing I've ever heard in my life.
[01:26:45.073 --> 01:26:48.915]  I mean, these people are just absolutely out of touch with reality.
[01:26:49.295 --> 01:26:50.756]  And you know, that's the good news, Gary.
[01:26:51.216 --> 01:26:54.018]  They still don't get the public's moved on from mainstream media.
[01:26:54.518 --> 01:26:59.300]  They don't get that trying to shut us down doesn't do anything, because no one's watching or believing them anyways.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.221]  And as you said, CNN had an article
[01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.351]  There needs to be an investigation.
[01:27:03.832 --> 01:27:11.420]  A conservative group owns Weekly Standard, and they're starting their new magazine, a new conservative magazine, and not funding the standard.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:23.372]  This needs to be investigated, as if a private company doesn't want to fund a neocon publication that no one wants to read, that CNN's defending, and as if it's a scandal that the Weekly Standard's going to shut down.
[01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:29.349]  Well, again, I think it's... First of all, we're talking about print publication.
[01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:31.029]  You know, I used to do the Republic Magazine.
[01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:35.171]  Very difficult to do these days, especially in a digital world.
[01:27:35.632 --> 01:27:38.933]  But again, I go back to the fact that the American people see through it.
[01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:46.217]  They voted for President Trump, and the global elite, the establishment elite, the GOP elite are not listening to the people.
[01:27:46.697 --> 01:27:54.481]  So these... the institutions that have been around for so long, feeding the lies to the American people, like the Weekly Standard,
[01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:58.727]  Are crumbling because no one is paying attention.
[01:27:58.747 --> 01:28:00.109]  They're paying attention to Alex Jones.
[01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:01.752]  They're paying attention to Mark Dice.
[01:28:01.772 --> 01:28:03.514]  They're paying attention to Next News.
[01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:09.464]  And that's what they're getting fed, the truth, so that they can go ahead and make the informed decisions and then elect presidents.
[01:28:11.195 --> 01:28:21.986]  We're going to come back and play the clips you were just talking about and then get into how the globalists are going to strike back and also break down George Herbert Walker Bush and the fifth funeral that hopefully, I guess, will be one more tomorrow.
[01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:23.587]  They're going to go bury him in College Station.
[01:28:23.607 --> 01:28:24.508]  It just never ends.
[01:28:24.568 --> 01:28:34.238]  And I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but, I mean, this guy was a uber-globalist anti-guy, wanted to abolish the NRA, launched all these fraudulent wars, was Mr. New World Order.
[01:28:34.998 --> 01:28:40.162]  And he was even against the nation-state existing, and then he's wrapped in the American flag.
[01:28:40.242 --> 01:28:40.963]  It's just too much.
[01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:42.664]  I know you're an expert on skull and bones.
[01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:46.567]  We'll talk about that with Gary Franchi of Next News Network as well.
[01:28:47.508 --> 01:28:50.670]  On the other side, please don't forget, without you spreading the links, we will fail.
[01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:51.831]  You spread the links, you're unstoppable.
[01:28:52.151 --> 01:28:58.116]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and the infamous Dreadnought, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:58.576 --> 01:29:01.959]  Next Year's News, today, and always faithful to the Republic.
[01:29:06.732 --> 01:29:11.013]  There's a lot of different schools of thought in marketing and in advertising and in sales.
[01:29:12.034 --> 01:29:15.915]  Now, I've been on the radio and TV for 23 plus years.
[01:29:15.935 --> 01:29:18.335]  I never went to any professional schools.
[01:29:19.176 --> 01:29:24.357]  But over the years, I learned a lot about those professional schools and the different perspectives.
[01:29:25.517 --> 01:29:28.358]  There's five or six different ways that people pitch things.
[01:29:28.418 --> 01:29:31.099]  And there's different permutations and commutations of that.
[01:29:32.679 --> 01:29:35.402]  But I just come from it with the golden rule.
[01:29:35.462 --> 01:29:36.844]  Treat others like you want to be treated.
[01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:40.769]  Do unto others as you would like to be done unto you.
[01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:49.353]  We've taken that philosophy to the next level with all the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:50.034 --> 01:29:53.214]  Now, let's just look at two different systems of sales.
[01:29:53.254 --> 01:30:04.217]  The one that we fall into and then the one that targets about 25% of the population that is currently still the most successful and the most lucrative system.
[01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:07.038]  The corrupt form
[01:30:08.442 --> 01:30:13.505]  I wouldn't say it's completely evil, because it's targeting folks that just always want to pay more.
[01:30:14.445 --> 01:30:22.329]  It's a system where you put everything into it being elite and being top end and the most expensive.
[01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:28.473]  And in almost every case, what's in it does not measure up even close to what it's costing.
[01:30:29.553 --> 01:30:30.794]  Now, I've got a little bit of money.
[01:30:31.704 --> 01:30:35.225]  And so if I wanted to buy something fancy, just because it's fancy, I could do it.
[01:30:36.086 --> 01:30:48.231]  But there's a lot of things that if it's a rip-off, even though I want it and I need it, I'm gonna go find the alternative that's as good, a lot of times better, for less just because I'm not into wasting for no reason.
[01:30:48.411 --> 01:30:50.732]  I'd rather give it to charity or something like that.
[01:30:51.632 --> 01:30:55.594]  But that's the two different schools of thought I wanted to get into is the one where
[01:30:56.736 --> 01:31:06.146]  They know that if something's supposedly the best, you say it's the best, even though it's not, and you charge an outrageous amount, people believe it must be the best because it's an outrageous amount.
[01:31:06.686 --> 01:31:07.848]  Now, here's what I do.
[01:31:09.008 --> 01:31:14.270]  I go out of my own life and I find what is the best for the very lowest price.
[01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:15.130]  And here's an example.
[01:31:15.391 --> 01:31:18.192]  I have a Dodge Hellcat that came out four years ago.
[01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:21.193]  I didn't want a really fast sports car because I didn't want to be flashy.
[01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:22.673]  I was at the Dodge dealership.
[01:31:22.753 --> 01:31:23.394]  I bought a truck.
[01:31:23.514 --> 01:31:24.094]  The guy was illiterate.
[01:31:24.114 --> 01:31:24.854]  He said, have you heard of Hellcats?
[01:31:24.874 --> 01:31:25.915]  They're going to be coming out in about a year.
[01:31:26.115 --> 01:31:27.695]  And I said, uh, no.
[01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:31.257]  And he said, well, it's a Dodge Challenger, 700 plus horsepower.
[01:31:31.417 --> 01:31:31.717]  It's only $63,000.
[01:31:32.517 --> 01:31:34.598]  And Ferrari owns us now.
[01:31:34.838 --> 01:31:37.159]  And to have a car like this would cost like half a million dollars.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:42.145]  And it didn't stick out, but I like a really fast, cool car, so I have the best of both worlds.
[01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:45.188]  It's like a Challenger, but I've driven one of my friend's Ferraris.
[01:31:45.268 --> 01:31:46.210]  It's as fast.
[01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:46.910]  It's insane.
[01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:48.412]  That's my mindset.
[01:31:48.933 --> 01:31:53.959]  I want a badass, black Ferrari for $63,000 instead of a half million or a million.
[01:31:54.119 --> 01:31:55.500]  I mean, go for two million for a Ferrari.
[01:31:56.321 --> 01:31:57.302]  I don't want the bling.
[01:31:57.522 --> 01:31:58.183]  I want the zing.
[01:31:58.463 --> 01:32:03.908]  We sold out, for their year of in-sale, of the Alexa Pure Pro gravity-fed filter.
[01:32:03.968 --> 01:32:04.609]  We sold it all out.
[01:32:04.929 --> 01:32:06.010]  They didn't think we could do it.
[01:32:06.211 --> 01:32:06.691]  You bought it.
[01:32:06.731 --> 01:32:07.472]  It's a great system.
[01:32:07.672 --> 01:32:09.554]  You got it for basically 49% off, half off.
[01:32:09.574 --> 01:32:10.615]  They've never done that.
[01:32:11.095 --> 01:32:16.159]  They're going to do the Alexa Pure Rees, that is, an ion filter, normally $250.
[01:32:16.479 --> 01:32:18.581]  Leading competitors aren't as good, they're $800.
[01:32:18.841 --> 01:32:19.281]  Same deal.
[01:32:19.762 --> 01:32:23.044]  Similar systems, four-stage ions, that aren't even as good, $400, $600, $800 depending on the unit.
[01:32:23.064 --> 01:32:23.485]  This is normally $240, $250.
[01:32:26.927 --> 01:32:27.067]  It's $127.
[01:32:27.427 --> 01:32:30.349]  Again, they're selling them to us at cost.
[01:32:30.729 --> 01:32:34.311]  We make like $30, and it clears out their end-of-year inventory.
[01:32:34.772 --> 01:32:36.813]  And it's so good for your house, so good for your family.
[01:32:37.013 --> 01:32:37.573]  It's amazing.
[01:32:37.633 --> 01:32:40.535]  Alexa Pure Breeze at mfullworthstore.com.
[01:32:41.035 --> 01:32:49.060]  It is the Hellcat of air filtration compared to the Ferraris that aren't even as good but have a so-called bling and cost five times more.

[01:32:51.662 --> 01:32:52.422]  Alexa, pure breeze.

[01:32:55.785 --> 01:32:56.365]  You can't lose.
[01:32:56.405 --> 01:32:59.067]  It supports the m4 and your own health for you and your children.

[01:33:06.493 --> 01:33:09.095]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.638 --> 01:33:30.604]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:32.445 --> 01:33:37.088]  There's a story up on NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:37.108 --> 01:33:40.170]  It's also easier to find on DrudgeReport.com, so we'll talk about this next segment.
[01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:43.972]  Well, Gary Franci, not this one, but... I can't find it in my stack.
[01:33:44.032 --> 01:33:44.993]  You guys reprint me that, thanks.
[01:33:46.203 --> 01:33:53.346]  Where elementary schools are banning not just Christmas trees, but red and green.
[01:33:54.326 --> 01:34:11.534]  Now, I remember conservative shows talking about this 20 years ago, the war on Christmas, and I couldn't believe it until I saw in Texas, in Houston, Austin, and Dallas about 15 years ago, because the local teacher associations put this out via the feds,
[01:34:13.035 --> 01:34:14.237]  Don't hand out Christmas cards.
[01:34:14.277 --> 01:34:16.481]  Well, I have free speech to whatever I want, but they said no.
[01:34:16.882 --> 01:34:18.866]  No Christmas, no period, because it's Christian.
[01:34:19.627 --> 01:34:24.496]  So even the bastardized, you know, Tannenbaum and all that, it's really German, druidic.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.280]  I mean, it's pretty.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.321]  I don't mean any evil by it.
[01:34:28.361 --> 01:34:29.242]  So, you know, I like it.
[01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:32.524]  But that's why I brought... Let's cover this now first, since I've got to it.
[01:34:32.984 --> 01:34:35.386]  That's why now, the last few years, we do have Christmas trees.
[01:34:36.267 --> 01:34:40.129]  And we do even put crosses up on them for wars now during promotions.
[01:34:40.169 --> 01:34:43.192]  Because if you try to take it away from me, I'm really going to do it.
[01:34:43.232 --> 01:34:46.094]  But that shows how there's never an end, Gary.
[01:34:46.734 --> 01:34:50.697]  All over the country, they're now saying Santa Claus is bad.
[01:34:51.037 --> 01:34:53.839]  Santa Claus has nothing to do with the Christian part of Christmas.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.141]  Now that is being taken away.
[01:34:58.441 --> 01:35:03.083]  Now all these radio stations won't play these different songs.
[01:35:03.703 --> 01:35:11.686]  The BBC is calling for Christmas songs to be banned because if they can ban something as wholesome as that, they know they can ban anything.
[01:35:11.726 --> 01:35:15.408]  Why do you think they're doing this and why the hell do we put up with this crap?
[01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:22.891]  Well I think they're doing it Alex because I mean we live in a secular world
[01:35:23.553 --> 01:35:27.695]  Where they're doing everything they can to erase God from society.
[01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:33.957]  Erase the Creator, erase our Messiah, the reason we celebrate Christmas.
[01:35:34.478 --> 01:35:45.042]  I mean, Christ's birth is the entire nexus of salvation, and they do not want people to be saved.
[01:35:45.825 --> 01:35:46.865]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[01:35:46.905 --> 01:35:54.088]  So, the more they can push Christ out of Christmas, the more souls that they can condemn to hell.
[01:35:54.549 --> 01:35:55.829]  And that's exactly, that's what it is.
[01:35:55.889 --> 01:35:57.270]  I mean, the globalist New World Order.
[01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:58.991]  I mean, it's all scripture.
[01:35:59.111 --> 01:36:00.051]  It's all in the Bible.
[01:36:00.571 --> 01:36:02.132]  I mean, it says that's what's going to happen.
[01:36:02.272 --> 01:36:04.893]  In the end of days, there will be a New World Order.
[01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:06.614]  There will be a global society.
[01:36:06.914 --> 01:36:07.934]  It will be godless.
[01:36:09.115 --> 01:36:11.916]  And this is all steps to that end.
[01:36:13.413 --> 01:36:19.336]  It'll be godless because if you get internal memos from the different parties in the EU, they admit that.
[01:36:20.197 --> 01:36:24.899]  They say that we want people to only worship the state and our party.
[01:36:28.281 --> 01:36:30.842]  Well, I mean, the state, again, the state is godless.
[01:36:30.862 --> 01:36:31.763]  The state is secular.
[01:36:32.243 --> 01:36:33.303]  They want to be gods.
[01:36:33.724 --> 01:36:36.405]  They want to set themselves up in the temple and be worshipped.
[01:36:37.185 --> 01:36:38.066]  But it's blasphemy.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:46.299]  And again, the American people, the Christian core that this nation was found on, we see through these things and we continue to pursue and push through.
[01:36:47.546 --> 01:36:52.849]  I mean, ultimately it will be their demise when they're all tossed in the lake of fire in the Great Pit at the end.
[01:36:52.869 --> 01:36:55.551]  And it's going to take some time to get there.
[01:36:55.971 --> 01:36:57.251]  But, I mean, just look around us.
[01:36:57.892 --> 01:36:59.753]  The prophecy signs are there.
[01:37:00.693 --> 01:37:03.375]  Christians will be mocked in the end of days.
[01:37:03.495 --> 01:37:05.716]  We will be beheaded for our truth.
[01:37:05.736 --> 01:37:09.038]  We will be attacked for what we believe in.
[01:37:09.941 --> 01:37:16.723]  And the more that they persecute us, the more they reinforce what we know to be true, and gives us even more strength.
[01:37:16.783 --> 01:37:19.303]  Again, no weapon formed against us shall prosper, Alex.
[01:37:20.263 --> 01:37:23.644]  You turn on the news now, and it's crazy.
[01:37:23.844 --> 01:37:24.844]  One world government.
[01:37:24.944 --> 01:37:26.185]  Everyone will take a microchip.
[01:37:26.605 --> 01:37:28.865]  Global social scores to buy and sell.
[01:37:28.945 --> 01:37:32.606]  And it's all here, and it's all happening, and it's all unfolding.
[01:37:32.626 --> 01:37:34.126]  And then they talk about Facebook.
[01:37:34.146 --> 01:37:35.827]  And I'm not defending Facebook, but Facebook was...
[01:37:36.767 --> 01:37:42.113]  Telling developers they might need to pay them to get access to user data so they can build their apps.
[01:37:42.213 --> 01:37:42.974]  Okay, that's wrong.
[01:37:43.495 --> 01:37:50.943]  Compared to Google, 10 years ago got caught driving around with their cars, stealing people's passwords, and all this other crap.
[01:37:51.023 --> 01:37:52.004]  It's just crazy.
[01:37:52.344 --> 01:37:58.091]  Then you learn, oh, they're only going after Facebook because George Soros is involved in a hostile takeover of Facebook right now.
[01:37:59.798 --> 01:38:01.199]  Well, he's buying up all that stock.
[01:38:01.239 --> 01:38:06.503]  And then, of course, one side of his mouth, he talks negatively about it.
[01:38:07.043 --> 01:38:09.785]  And then he, you know, the stock tanks, he comes in and buys more.
[01:38:09.825 --> 01:38:13.387]  And then, you know, it's a pump and dump scheme from that guy.
[01:38:14.048 --> 01:38:15.889]  But that guy's got his hands in everything.
[01:38:16.309 --> 01:38:16.729]  Everything!
[01:38:16.769 --> 01:38:29.594]  I mean, go look down at the Open Society for Central America, pumping these migrants up to create an optics to fight against President Trump's policies of immigration.
[01:38:29.634 --> 01:38:32.635]  I mean, it's all over the place, Alex.
[01:38:32.755 --> 01:38:44.300]  I mean, what's really terrifying, I'm going on a tangent here, but when you look at the social media elements and you see what just happened, the new email threads that have been released regarding
[01:38:45.029 --> 01:38:51.855]  The actual discussion of censorship of conservatives, it's terrifying.
[01:38:52.395 --> 01:39:06.366]  It's terrifying, but when this information gets out to the public, it is so critical for people like you and me to bring this information ever for, so that the American people have one more piece of information to hang their hat on when they make those decisions.
[01:39:08.228 --> 01:39:10.350]  Especially after Google and Facebook and Twitter
[01:39:11.465 --> 01:39:22.011]  Ball face lie to Congress and say we've never censored anybody and they have internal Google videos from the day after the election saying we'll never let this happen again, we'll censor more.
[01:39:22.371 --> 01:39:28.575]  They censored the search results on Hillary, they dialed back our search results, but now they just outright
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:45.890]  Ban us everywhere, and then the head of Apple just got an award from the ADL, Gary, saying, saying that it's a sin not to ban me, because I'm calling for violence, but I don't get a way to respond on those platforms that's posted on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, because I'm banned from those.
[01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:47.871]  I can't respond to his lie.
[01:39:49.693 --> 01:39:54.996]  Yeah, I remember when I watched that video, and we did a report on that here, they referred to a violent
[01:39:55.874 --> 01:39:57.635]  A conspiracy theorist.
[01:39:57.655 --> 01:40:02.839]  And I said to myself and I said to my viewers as we were covering, I said, who's violent?
[01:40:03.099 --> 01:40:05.621]  What violence did Alex say?
[01:40:06.321 --> 01:40:09.623]  These are maybe words that he said, but there was no violence committed.
[01:40:09.643 --> 01:40:10.404]  There was no act.
[01:40:10.964 --> 01:40:15.067]  So when they go ahead and they paint these narratives for the American people,
[01:40:15.945 --> 01:40:18.086]  And now they're getting awarded for it.
[01:40:18.386 --> 01:40:20.526]  But remember, this is a small group of people.
[01:40:21.007 --> 01:40:23.547]  It's a small group of people all scratching each other's back.
[01:40:23.607 --> 01:40:26.228]  It's just like the Oscars or the Emmys.
[01:40:26.748 --> 01:40:34.511]  It's a small group of elitists who they can put up a nice stage show and they can present it to the people who they think care.
[01:40:34.871 --> 01:40:44.694]  But at the end of the day, when you look at the numbers, when you look at the sheer numbers of the independent outlets that are functioning in the United States, when you look at that,
[01:40:45.274 --> 01:40:47.016]  It dwarfs anything.
[01:40:47.036 --> 01:40:47.397]  You're right.
[01:40:48.758 --> 01:40:53.603]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, and all the big corporate media is downsizing and closing its doors.
[01:40:54.044 --> 01:41:01.652]  They're just trying to censor us because we've all been expanding and because our listeners understand it's a war and are supporting us and are spreading the word now more than ever.
[01:41:02.012 --> 01:41:02.512]  And you're right.
[01:41:02.793 --> 01:41:05.576]  Tim Cook, with his slave factories in China, is in an echo chamber.
[01:41:06.477 --> 01:41:12.483]  And Silicon Valley's in an echo chamber and so arrogant that the head of Google wouldn't even testify when Congress asked him to.
[01:41:12.803 --> 01:41:13.864]  Now he's been ordered to.
[01:41:14.185 --> 01:41:17.588]  We'll be covering that here live next Tuesday on Airwhen it unfolds.
[01:41:17.768 --> 01:41:20.451]  We'll be right back with Gary Franci of the Next News Network.
[01:41:20.471 --> 01:41:22.473]  We'll tell you how to listen and how to watch when we come back.
[01:41:22.894 --> 01:41:27.439]  But because we mentioned it, here's a little bit of the classic Dr. Seuss, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.
[01:41:27.699 --> 01:41:28.400]  And of the left,
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:36.404]  Demonizing family and demonizing Christmas and demonizing Santa Claus now and demonizing everything as saying Jingle Bells is racist.
[01:41:36.504 --> 01:41:40.405]  If they aren't worse than the Grinch who stole Christmas, then nothing is.
[01:41:40.446 --> 01:41:40.906]  Here it is.
[01:41:42.146 --> 01:41:44.567]  You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
[01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.758]  That looks like Michael Obama.
[01:41:51.118 --> 01:41:52.039]  No, that's McGregor.
[01:42:12.486 --> 01:42:16.810]  You're a monster, Mr. Grinch.
[01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:17.711]  You're a harvester.
[01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:20.614]  You're trying to teach five-year-olds there's another sex.
[01:42:21.154 --> 01:42:21.715]  You're a pervert!
[01:42:21.775 --> 01:42:23.516]  Your brain is full of spiders.
[01:42:23.536 --> 01:42:24.277]  You're a pedophile!
[01:42:24.297 --> 01:42:28.160]  Garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch.
[01:42:29.762 --> 01:42:33.665]  I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine and a half foot pole.
[01:42:36.058 --> 01:42:39.420]  You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch.
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:44.484]  You have turned my skin your smile.
[01:42:45.024 --> 01:42:51.749]  You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch.
[01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:58.433]  Given the choice between the two of you, I'd take the seasick crocodile.
[01:43:02.947 --> 01:43:10.992]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[01:43:11.292 --> 01:43:22.439]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[01:43:22.719 --> 01:43:30.544]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.

[01:43:40.593 --> 01:43:47.620]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the new world order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty and trying to shut down the free press is.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:56.068]  And that's why when you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, you don't just give yourself the gift of high quality supplements or storable foods or incredible water filtration.
[01:43:56.388 --> 01:44:01.952]  No, you give yourself the gift of funding the First Amendment in a desperate attempt to save this country.
[01:44:02.492 --> 01:44:07.576]  Even though InfoWars has delivered the fight against tyranny like no other, we're not just asking for your support.
[01:44:07.936 --> 01:44:11.898]  We're asking you to have a 360 win because this is the biggest sale of the year.

[01:44:34.812 --> 01:44:39.095]  When you shop at InfoWarsStore.com, you don't just get incredible sales during the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:44:39.435 --> 01:44:42.136]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the gloveless.
[01:44:42.556 --> 01:44:51.121]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfoWarsStore.com is the last run, 55% off, of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:44:51.221 --> 01:44:53.242]  It's hard to procure it anymore, so we're discontinuing it.
[01:44:53.262 --> 01:44:55.163]  You know it's a bestseller at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:55.783 --> 01:44:59.227]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire info war possible.
[01:44:59.588 --> 01:45:01.550]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:45:02.151 --> 01:45:11.443]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:11.483 --> 01:45:13.745]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:14.346 --> 01:45:20.429]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:26.933]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:27.393 --> 01:45:32.996]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:45:33.717 --> 01:45:40.700]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:40.781 --> 01:45:40.981]  But!
[01:45:41.821 --> 01:45:54.393]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:54.914 --> 01:45:58.678]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:59.178 --> 01:46:01.901]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:46:06.778 --> 01:46:11.928]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[01:46:12.289 --> 01:46:14.373]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[01:46:16.337 --> 01:46:25.339]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:31.900]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[01:46:32.401 --> 01:46:37.222]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[01:46:37.622 --> 01:46:38.582]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:46:38.982 --> 01:46:41.083]  That's so fast, InfoWars.
[01:46:41.443 --> 01:46:43.183]  Apple banned your app.
[01:46:44.603 --> 01:46:47.084]  I helped, too!
[01:46:47.624 --> 01:46:48.645]  Oh, Oliver.
[01:46:49.025 --> 01:46:52.305]  I hate free speech, too!
[01:46:52.425 --> 01:46:54.826]  We hate free speech!
[01:46:54.846 --> 01:46:56.627]  We hate free speech!
[01:46:56.787 --> 01:46:58.427]  We hate free speech!
[01:46:58.507 --> 01:47:00.167]  We hate free speech!
[01:47:06.471 --> 01:47:09.172]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.176 --> 01:47:21.139]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:47:21.399 --> 01:47:25.541]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:47:26.161 --> 01:47:29.503]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[01:47:30.797 --> 01:47:33.926]  Now we mentioned this earlier, but since Gary brought it up, let's go ahead and play it.
[01:47:34.328 --> 01:47:37.116]  This is Congresswoman from Hawaii, Heron Ho.
[01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:41.952]  Saying men need to just sit down, white men particularly, and just shut up.
[01:47:42.752 --> 01:47:45.054]  I mean, this is the authoritarianism of the left.
[01:47:45.094 --> 01:47:58.401]  They just want you to shut up, and then have some weird war against men by women, when a bunch of foreign megabanks owned and run by men, that own slave factories all over the world, are telling men and women to fight with each other.
[01:47:58.961 --> 01:48:02.023]  This is just incredible how disruptive corporate media is.
[01:48:02.043 --> 01:48:05.605]  Gary Franchi's riding shotgun with us from the Next News Network.
[01:48:06.005 --> 01:48:06.846]  Now let's play that clip.
[01:48:06.886 --> 01:48:07.146]  Here it is.
[01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:10.410]  Who's perpetuating all of these kinds of actions?
[01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:15.515]  It's the men in this country, and I just want to say to the men in this country to shut up and step up.
[01:48:16.436 --> 01:48:18.358]  Do the right thing, for a change.
[01:48:18.799 --> 01:48:20.821]  Now, let's go to the new clip that Gary mentioned.
[01:48:20.841 --> 01:48:24.624]  This is her... well, I mean, just hear it for yourself.
[01:48:25.745 --> 01:48:29.709]  Democrats aren't in full power because their constituents are stupid.
[01:48:29.749 --> 01:48:30.070]  Here it is.
[01:48:31.067 --> 01:48:37.490]  The Democrats have a really hard time connecting to people's hearts instead of here.
[01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:41.972]  We're really good at shoving out all the information that touches people here but not here.
[01:48:42.512 --> 01:48:51.096]  I have been saying at all of our Senate Democratic retreats that we need to speak to the heart, not in a manipulative way, not in a way that brings forth everybody's fears.
[01:48:51.776 --> 01:48:52.396]  I don't know.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.045]  You know, if Democrats are so smart, why, when you go to one of their events, do their constituents look like they've had lobotomies?
[01:49:24.605 --> 01:49:28.589]  And studies show they're nine times more likely not to give to charities, six times more likely to steal.
[01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:31.171]  I mean, those numbers are in international studies.
[01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:34.714]  Europe, the U.S., Canada, it's well known.
[01:49:35.915 --> 01:49:39.558]  The blue cities are the worst, hands down, normally crimes.
[01:49:39.898 --> 01:49:41.079]  Three times, red cities.
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:44.022]  There's always more poverty, human feces everywhere.
[01:49:44.862 --> 01:49:50.685]  You know, the fairy godmother, you know, brings like little presents and stuff, but Democrats bring collapse of civilization, Gary Franchi.
[01:49:52.346 --> 01:50:05.253]  You know, when I saw her say that, I just couldn't help but like think to myself, this is exactly, she's admitting that they are out of touch, that they are out of touch with the American people.
[01:50:05.493 --> 01:50:08.615]  That is a, that's the admission right there, Alex.
[01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:10.536]  That's all, that's all that people need to see.
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.403]  It's a microcosm of the greater problem in the Democrat Party.
[01:50:14.884 --> 01:50:16.846]  That they think they're better than all of us.
[01:50:17.506 --> 01:50:19.048]  But it's an absolute lie.
[01:50:19.448 --> 01:50:22.652]  They want to control everybody because they think they know what's best.
[01:50:23.232 --> 01:50:23.553]  But no.
[01:50:23.653 --> 01:50:24.814]  We know what's best.
[01:50:25.074 --> 01:50:25.835]  Freedom is best.
[01:50:26.376 --> 01:50:32.422]  So when we can make our own decisions, when we can lead our own future, that's what's most important.
[01:50:32.970 --> 01:50:45.955]  And Gary, their whole system is about making us feel like we're alone, making us feel like we're desperate, making conservatives, Christians, nationalists, patriots of any color or race feel alone when we really globally are the common sense position.
[01:50:45.995 --> 01:50:46.975]  The numbers show that.
[01:50:48.186 --> 01:50:49.306]  But let's expand on that.
[01:50:49.586 --> 01:50:52.167]  You have had videos that have had 10 million views apiece.
[01:50:52.667 --> 01:50:55.588]  You've reached billions of people just on one of your YouTube channels.
[01:50:56.489 --> 01:51:09.633]  And right before the election, they had a big poll and a major publication and you were found to be number one most popular on YouTube ahead of Alex Jones, The Young Turks, Fox News, ABC News, NBC News.
[01:51:10.213 --> 01:51:12.054]  So, Hillary Clinton's down at eight.
[01:51:13.234 --> 01:51:14.315]  The White House is down at nine.
[01:51:15.116 --> 01:51:23.583]  And I want to speak to this because we're not tooting our horn, but in the real world, when you come from nowhere and you're number one year after year, that's when you get shadowbanned.
[01:51:23.603 --> 01:51:24.504]  Gary's been shadowbanned.
[01:51:24.524 --> 01:51:26.406]  So his average video gets 100,000 views, not 500,000 views.
[01:51:26.426 --> 01:51:29.409]  And this is what they did to me right after the election.
[01:51:29.469 --> 01:51:33.813]  Days after it went from just where our subscribers couldn't even see us on YouTube.
[01:51:33.833 --> 01:51:36.495]  So we'd already been banned before the larger ban four months ago.
[01:51:36.875 --> 01:51:38.096]  They just made it
[01:51:38.877 --> 01:51:39.598]  Uh, official.
[01:51:39.618 --> 01:51:45.382]  Uh, and so they were looking at who had the most views, uh, I guess just the last few months of the election.
[01:51:45.763 --> 01:51:50.206]  They're in with 99, uh, plus million just, uh, I guess that month.
[01:51:50.506 --> 01:51:53.308]  And then Gary even ahead of InfoWars.
[01:51:53.328 --> 01:51:54.850]  And by the way, I'm not in competition with Gary.
[01:51:56.411 --> 01:51:57.232]  We just lost his Skype.
[01:51:57.252 --> 01:51:57.992]  We'll get him back on.
[01:51:59.473 --> 01:52:00.494]  It feels good to know he's there.
[01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:07.680]  But it makes me mad to know over and over and over again
[01:52:09.577 --> 01:52:14.881]  That the talk show host and the podcasters who tow the line, they get left alone and promoted.
[01:52:15.502 --> 01:52:17.023]  When you tell the truth, you get banned.
[01:52:17.423 --> 01:52:26.931]  And then the very people that don't get banned then sit there, formerly your friend, I guess, and talk crap about you, knowing you can't respond.
[01:52:28.832 --> 01:52:30.814]  And it doesn't hurt you that you've been banned.
[01:52:31.294 --> 01:52:37.159]  It hurts you that there's so many people that go along with the system and the corruption and bend over backwards.
[01:52:38.117 --> 01:52:41.399]  You know, it's one thing if people don't want to defend you and they go with the establishment attack.
[01:52:42.119 --> 01:52:44.440]  It's another thing, though, when people relish.
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.703]  You're not getting ahead if you're in a Don King boxing match and they put somebody in the ring with you that's going to take a dive.
[01:52:53.244 --> 01:52:54.665]  You're not really the heavyweight champion.
[01:52:56.606 --> 01:52:57.506]  And so that's what I'm saying.
[01:52:57.747 --> 01:53:00.328]  These talk show hosts you see are propped up.
[01:53:00.408 --> 01:53:04.790]  They're force-fed by the system because they're pushing an agenda that the system wants.
[01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:06.551]  And I know the audience gets that, but when you're saying
[01:53:07.642 --> 01:53:12.064]  George Herbert Walker Bush and five days of worship and endless garbage.
[01:53:12.124 --> 01:53:13.785]  It's because he was a bad person.
[01:53:15.265 --> 01:53:18.867]  You see Trump constantly demonizing and lying about because he's a good person.
[01:53:20.608 --> 01:53:22.349]  We're going to get Franchi back on so he can finish.
[01:53:22.409 --> 01:53:23.149]  And I want to finish up with him.
[01:53:23.169 --> 01:53:24.009]  Maybe do one more segment.
[01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:25.470]  Next News Network.
[01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:28.511]  You can find him on Twitter at Gary Franchi and you can find him on YouTube.
[01:53:28.811 --> 01:53:30.392]  And of course we're going to give out his website as well.
[01:53:30.712 --> 01:53:31.633]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:53:32.793 --> 01:53:34.094]  I didn't even plug in the first hour today.
[01:53:35.422 --> 01:53:36.823]  We're running our biggest specials ever.
[01:53:36.863 --> 01:53:40.585]  If people just do their Christmas shopping with InfoWars, we'll be able to expand and do some amazing things.
[01:53:42.266 --> 01:53:43.507]  If you don't, we'll get shut down.
[01:53:44.608 --> 01:53:45.168]  Every order.
[01:53:46.349 --> 01:53:47.370]  It's a free t-shirt.
[01:53:48.130 --> 01:53:51.652]  Even if it's one tube of toothpaste, it's fluoride-free, coital, silver iodine, fortified, super blue.
[01:53:52.773 --> 01:53:55.195]  We're selling it right now, 50% off, it's like seven bucks.
[01:53:56.175 --> 01:53:58.317]  Free shipping, that's in five bucks it costs us.
[01:53:58.377 --> 01:53:59.657]  Then a free t-shirt, that's five bucks.
[01:54:00.478 --> 01:54:03.540]  So that order right there, a tube of toothpaste, we lose like ten bucks.
[01:54:05.985 --> 01:54:07.867]  Yeah, I guess about seven, eight bucks.
[01:54:08.167 --> 01:54:10.789]  But I want you to get the free t-shirt.
[01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:12.270]  We are all Alex Jones.
[01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:13.932]  Don't censor me with a Gadsden flag.
[01:54:14.292 --> 01:54:17.755]  Now those shirts are gonna sell out soon, so we'll continue the special right through to Christmas.
[01:54:18.055 --> 01:54:19.897]  There'll be a new t-shirt posted the next few days.
[01:54:19.977 --> 01:54:23.199]  Until that runs out, then it'll be the next shirt.
[01:54:23.219 --> 01:54:23.920]  55% off.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:25.361]  Super Male Vitality.
[01:54:26.442 --> 01:54:27.283]  It's the last run of it.
[01:54:27.323 --> 01:54:28.103]  It's been a bestseller.
[01:54:28.684 --> 01:54:29.945]  But because it's so hard to make,
[01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:38.473]  So proprietary, and expensive for us to produce, we are discontinuing Supermill Vitality.
[01:54:38.853 --> 01:54:48.116]  55% off, 50-75% off all the products, a bunch of huge specials, Alexa Pure Breeze, normally $240, leading competitors are $500.
[01:54:49.237 --> 01:54:50.217]  It is a loss leader.
[01:54:50.237 --> 01:54:57.439]  They're selling it to us, the manufacturer, to get rid of the extra inventory they have ahead of the end of the year, and inventory taxes.
[01:54:57.939 --> 01:55:00.000]  This is the best deal on Alexa Pure Breezes ever.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.863]  Only a few thousand left, it will be sold out in just a few days.
[01:55:05.963 --> 01:55:09.526]  As well, just like the Alexa Pure Pro Gravity Fed System did sell out.
[01:55:10.007 --> 01:55:11.027]  So do your shopping with us.
[01:55:11.088 --> 01:55:12.008]  Don't fight the traffic.
[01:55:12.048 --> 01:55:12.849]  Don't fight the crowds.
[01:55:13.269 --> 01:55:14.831]  And support your children's future.
[01:55:14.871 --> 01:55:15.811]  Support the First Amendment.
[01:55:15.831 --> 01:55:17.173]  Support Americana.
[01:55:17.573 --> 01:55:18.734]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:18.834 --> 01:55:19.755]  Free shipping storewide.
[01:55:19.815 --> 01:55:20.715]  Double Patriot Points.
[01:55:21.216 --> 01:55:21.936]  A free t-shirt.
[01:55:22.890 --> 01:55:23.711]  And so much more.
[01:55:23.731 --> 01:55:24.872]  The biggest discounts ever.
[01:55:25.372 --> 01:55:31.538]  We are selling all of our inventory out by the end of the year as a strategic move in case Soros is successful shutting down our merchant accounts.
[01:55:31.558 --> 01:55:33.380]  Then we have a new model after that.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.181]  We are in absolute bunker mode.
[01:55:35.422 --> 01:55:38.565]  So please support us and get a piece of Americana history with the t-shirt.
[01:55:39.005 --> 01:55:42.087]  Going back to Gary Franchi, you got cut off for five minutes with the miracle of Skype.
[01:55:42.147 --> 01:55:46.049]  Please do five more minutes with us in the next hour because I've been asking the questions here.
[01:55:46.309 --> 01:55:47.190]  You're a smart cookie.
[01:55:47.210 --> 01:55:48.191]  You've got children like I do.
[01:55:48.211 --> 01:55:49.051]  It means you're in the game.
[01:55:49.551 --> 01:55:51.272]  What else is front and center on your radar?
[01:55:51.793 --> 01:55:52.974]  What are you most concerned about?
[01:55:53.114 --> 01:55:56.796]  I'm worried about them trying to plunge the stock market as they said they would do to stop Trump.
[01:55:58.171 --> 01:55:59.192]  That's a good point you make.
[01:56:00.073 --> 01:56:01.454]  I guess that frequently head on.
[01:56:01.874 --> 01:56:19.169]  We've had discussions about this very thing, about the fact when you have a great economy, you've got President Trump decreasing regulations, you've got people going back to work, you've got trade deals that have been horrific for America being redrafted in our favor.
[01:56:19.229 --> 01:56:21.711]  You know, the art of the deal on a global stage is actually functioning.
[01:56:22.312 --> 01:56:22.612]  And then
[01:56:24.082 --> 01:56:24.743]  Who steps in?
[01:56:25.323 --> 01:56:37.332]  The banking cartel, the central bankers, messing around with the interest rates and changing things and causing the entire Trump economy to slow down or even collapse.
[01:56:37.852 --> 01:56:40.274]  And that is, I think, probably the greatest threat.
[01:56:40.334 --> 01:56:50.622]  As you know, Alex, you and I have been fighting in the streets against the Federal Reserve for years and years, organizing massive, massive street rallies, protesting the central bankers.
[01:56:50.862 --> 01:56:53.726]  You had the first idea to protest him and we did it all over the country.
[01:56:54.026 --> 01:56:58.673]  We've been in huge marches together against the private Federal Reserve that admittedly is trying to crash the economy.
[01:57:00.091 --> 01:57:00.451]  Exactly.
[01:57:00.551 --> 01:57:01.931]  And that's the greatest threat.
[01:57:02.612 --> 01:57:09.693]  Because the people who are controlling the money supply are the ones who can destroy all the prosperity that's being created under the Trump economy.
[01:57:10.053 --> 01:57:11.353]  So we have to be very careful.
[01:57:11.554 --> 01:57:12.894]  We have to watch very closely.
[01:57:13.214 --> 01:57:22.536]  We have to figure out solutions to push back against that and expose that when it's happening so the American people can spend their money where it needs to be spent.
[01:57:23.166 --> 01:57:26.848]  So that they're not going ahead to contribute to the globalist banking cartel.
[01:57:27.148 --> 01:57:30.270]  But that again, that's the biggest threat that I see on the radar.
[01:57:30.590 --> 01:57:34.572]  Because when you have prosperity, the cartels, they don't want to see that.
[01:57:34.772 --> 01:57:36.212]  The banking cartels don't want to see that.
[01:57:36.533 --> 01:57:37.753]  They want to see people suffer.
[01:57:37.933 --> 01:57:42.836]  They want to see people be dependent upon the government handouts so that they can be controlled.
[01:57:43.176 --> 01:57:45.397]  And that's really what the biggest threat is, Alex.
[01:57:45.777 --> 01:57:49.801]  That's right, the Dow's down 376 plus points right now.
[01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:51.743]  The globals admit they're engineering this.
[01:57:52.624 --> 01:57:59.091]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:58:00.782 --> 01:58:02.243]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:58:02.464 --> 01:58:07.428]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:14.515]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:58:15.276 --> 01:58:22.943]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[01:58:23.704 --> 01:58:49.859]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[01:58:51.118 --> 01:58:57.442]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[01:58:57.882 --> 01:58:59.623]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[01:58:59.703 --> 01:59:04.626]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[01:59:05.087 --> 01:59:05.567]  It's big.
[01:59:06.127 --> 01:59:06.528]  It's bad.
[01:59:06.988 --> 01:59:12.211]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[01:59:12.231 --> 01:59:14.512]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[01:59:14.953 --> 01:59:18.155]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[01:59:18.775 --> 01:59:19.717]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:59:19.757 --> 01:59:20.919]  That's been going on for over a month.
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:22.923]  50 to 75% off.
[01:59:22.943 --> 01:59:23.945]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[01:59:25.011 --> 01:59:25.951]  The Double Patriot points.
[01:59:25.971 --> 01:59:26.892]  That's what happened in about a week.
[01:59:27.252 --> 01:59:33.875]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day, a free gift on top of it, and special mega-sales every day.
[01:59:34.335 --> 01:59:38.717]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:38.737 --> 01:59:40.618]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:59:40.878 --> 01:59:42.699]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:59:42.879 --> 01:59:44.940]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:49.122]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you, and thank you for your support.
[01:59:54.986 --> 01:59:59.107]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.627 --> 02:00:00.967]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.569 --> 02:00:19.470]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:23.871]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:27.259 --> 02:00:28.939]  Well, time goes fast with Gary Franci.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.341]  You can follow him on Twitter, at Next News Net, and at Gary Franci.
[02:00:34.381 --> 02:00:35.101]  Very important to both of us.
[02:00:35.141 --> 02:00:38.642]  But his Skype cut out, and I forgot we were talking about when that happened.
[02:00:39.362 --> 02:00:42.383]  And then his Skype came back, so I want to go back to this briefly and then hear what else is on his mind.
[02:00:42.403 --> 02:00:45.524]  I had a Matt Bracken joining us on national security issues that are very critical.
[02:00:46.764 --> 02:00:47.145]  Boom!
[02:00:47.205 --> 02:00:48.865]  This is right at the end of the election.
[02:00:49.625 --> 02:00:52.546]  At Gary Franci's Next News Net is now number one.
[02:00:53.686 --> 02:00:55.107]  And that's tumblerlabs.com.
[02:00:57.009 --> 02:01:00.052]  Number one ahead of the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:01:00.232 --> 02:01:00.853]  That was number two.
[02:01:00.913 --> 02:01:01.733]  Young Turks, number three.
[02:01:01.773 --> 02:01:02.514]  Fox News, number four.
[02:01:03.015 --> 02:01:04.396]  CNN is down at seven.
[02:01:04.456 --> 02:01:06.738]  That's why they had to get me banned.
[02:01:06.758 --> 02:01:08.139]  It's why they've shadow banned you.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.440]  Because they're pathetic.
[02:01:09.881 --> 02:01:13.684]  When Tim Cook says, oh, we've taken Alex Jones off iTunes because we're curating.
[02:01:14.565 --> 02:01:19.407]  Well, it's because we had 30-something million people a month listening to what we were doing.
[02:01:20.147 --> 02:01:23.649]  And all Apple had done is index our podcast.
[02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:24.629]  We were paying to stream out.
[02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:25.329]  We paid for the bandwidth.
[02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:27.530]  So these guys can't compete with us.
[02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:29.331]  They're really monsters, Gary.
[02:01:29.351 --> 02:01:36.093]  And now the system's betting that by blocking us on all these platforms, blocking you, dialing you back, that somehow they're going to win.
[02:01:36.133 --> 02:01:37.294]  But that isn't happening, is it?
[02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:53.884]  No, and I didn't realize that my feet had dropped, and what I was talking about when I was talking to the air, I mean I was talking to my people here, but is that if you take a look at the social plate statistics around that time of the election,
[02:01:54.682 --> 02:02:02.607]  Your channel, my channel, Mark Dice's channel, alternative and independent news channels, conservative news, had a massive, massive spike.
[02:02:02.647 --> 02:02:08.330]  And that's because it was organic, it was true, it's what people wanted to see, and it's what people were searching for online.
[02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:14.273]  But if you take a look at the CNNs, MSNBCs, BBCs, Fox News, at the very same time, they were flatlined.
[02:02:14.734 --> 02:02:18.996]  And then on November 1st of 2017, what happened was the algorithm flipped.
[02:02:19.436 --> 02:02:23.459]  And all of a sudden, you see all those corporate-approved news outlets
[02:02:24.779 --> 02:02:25.299]  That's right.
[02:02:46.024 --> 02:02:57.889]  Let's be clear, you put in Gary Franchi or you put in Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones, it's been in the emails, our names, it sends you to Trevor Noah, it sends you to Stephen Colbert, it sends you to CNN.
[02:02:57.949 --> 02:03:07.173]  They literally, on Google, on YouTube, send our people in the top 50 pages only to their crap to give them a boost.
[02:03:07.273 --> 02:03:09.094]  But the boost didn't work, now it's gone.
[02:03:09.174 --> 02:03:09.814]  It's incredible.
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:16.024]  Yeah, we're seeing an uptick as of late, which is encouraging.
[02:03:16.044 --> 02:03:25.393]  I think we're going to hit a million subscribers, God willing, in the next 60 to 90 days, and we're blessed to have that.
[02:03:25.973 --> 02:03:29.236]  But, you know, like you, you know that can be taken away at any moment.
[02:03:29.296 --> 02:03:35.822]  I go to sleep every night and I think to myself, I'm going to wake up in the morning with an email saying, sorry, you know, we're shutting you down.
[02:03:37.293 --> 02:03:44.719]  I mean, we've connected with some high hitters, some heavy hitters in the multi-channel space who help us and support us, you know, as advocates.
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:51.765]  But at the end of the day, you know, you have a platform you've built for so many years, and you can still continue to push forward.
[02:03:53.046 --> 02:03:54.026]  And I thank you for that.
[02:03:54.047 --> 02:03:55.348]  You're an inspiration for so many.
[02:03:55.788 --> 02:03:58.210]  But the reality is, is that they are manipulating the truth.
[02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:59.551]  They're manipulating the algorithms.
[02:04:00.171 --> 02:04:02.133]  And we have to push forward.
[02:04:02.513 --> 02:04:05.676]  Like, even though we have hundreds of thousands of subscribers,
[02:04:07.481 --> 02:04:08.942]  A lot of those people don't even get notifications.
[02:04:09.483 --> 02:04:11.204]  That's why people have got to stay hungry.
[02:04:11.224 --> 02:04:12.245]  They've got to know it's a war.
[02:04:12.365 --> 02:04:15.007]  It's up to the viewers at Lister's who are awesome to take action.
[02:04:15.087 --> 02:04:25.054]  Exactly as you said, we have to use the big globalist platformers, build our own platforms, and then all work together synergistically to defeat the censorship and these draconian activities.
[02:04:25.574 --> 02:04:29.237]  So at Twitter for now, at Gary Franci, also at Next News Network.
[02:04:29.617 --> 02:04:31.859]  How else can people find the great work you're doing daily?
[02:04:33.157 --> 02:04:34.918]  Well, I mean, they can go to YouTube.
[02:04:34.978 --> 02:04:38.660]  It's youtube.com slash nextnewsnetwork and they can find us there.
[02:04:39.481 --> 02:04:41.582]  You know, we put out about 15 reports a day.
[02:04:42.302 --> 02:04:45.584]  We cover a lot of the stuff that we see all over the conservative news.
[02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:47.185]  And you're doing a great job.
[02:04:47.745 --> 02:04:48.946]  Gary, come down in Austin.
[02:04:49.026 --> 02:04:49.786]  I'll fly you down here.
[02:04:49.806 --> 02:04:50.366]  Be in studio.
[02:04:50.386 --> 02:04:51.567]  Say hi to your wife and kids for me.
[02:04:52.127 --> 02:04:54.709]  You've been doing a great job for 15 plus years and we love you.
[02:04:54.929 --> 02:04:55.449]  God bless you.
[02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:57.170]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:59.632]  We'll be right back with Matt Brackett, InfoWars.com.
[02:05:06.767 --> 02:05:09.929]  Okay, so I have a gift here from the folks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:10.049 --> 02:05:16.174]  They wanted to thank me for getting the InfoWars t-shirts on the Rangers game for millions of people at sea, so they just brought me a gift.
[02:05:16.194 --> 02:05:17.074]  I don't even know what this is.
[02:05:17.094 --> 02:05:20.197]  Let's see what's going on.
[02:05:20.237 --> 02:05:20.717]  Wait a second.
[02:05:20.777 --> 02:05:20.997]  No!
[02:05:22.298 --> 02:05:22.618]  No!
[02:05:23.099 --> 02:05:23.699]  I got it!
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.581]  It's a Trump-educator shirt!
[02:05:26.601 --> 02:05:27.342]  Look at that, guys!
[02:05:30.891 --> 02:05:32.391]  I got the Trump Medusa shirt!
[02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:33.392]  What's that?
[02:05:33.432 --> 02:05:34.112]  There's more in there?
[02:05:34.572 --> 02:05:34.712]  Oh!
[02:05:36.312 --> 02:05:37.593]  It's a George Washington!
[02:05:37.933 --> 02:05:38.373]  Wow.
[02:05:39.573 --> 02:05:41.013]  I was not expecting this, really.
[02:05:41.053 --> 02:05:41.754]  Look at that one.
[02:05:42.274 --> 02:05:43.774]  That'll trigger somebody real good.
[02:05:44.674 --> 02:05:44.974]  Oh yeah.
[02:05:46.655 --> 02:05:47.395]  Wow, wow.
[02:05:47.455 --> 02:05:49.735]  I'm like a kid on Christmas today.
[02:05:50.256 --> 02:05:50.556]  Man.
[02:05:51.396 --> 02:05:53.596]  I want to thank the folks at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:53.896 --> 02:05:54.657]  This is amazing.
[02:05:54.757 --> 02:05:55.877]  I was not expecting this.
[02:06:10.044 --> 02:06:15.046]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.388 --> 02:06:23.289]  Every day until he is impeached!
[02:06:24.349 --> 02:06:33.453]  The lame-duck non-stop impeachment scorched earth policy will be unleashed when the newly elected Democrats take their seats in the House in January 2019.
[02:06:34.673 --> 02:06:39.495]  Signs of the oncoming impeachment inquisition are already bursting at the seams.
[02:06:39.795 --> 02:06:51.622]  Democrats are lining up to get on House Judiciary because they're expecting it to be the place where the action is, in part, of course, because Nadler would be in a position to preside over any potential impeachment proceedings.
[02:06:51.722 --> 02:07:04.210]  If you try to impeach him without the Republicans coming on board to actually remove him, it is a waste of time, it's a waste of political capital, and it will lead to the Democrats losing their majority and Donald Trump being re-elected president in 2020.
[02:07:04.670 --> 02:07:07.712]  But if you put your ear to the ground in the District of Criminals,
[02:07:07.972 --> 02:07:18.936]  You can hear the tick-tock of any hope of draining the swamp, counting down, as Hillary likely sits on a mountain of blackmail defending her laundry list of crimes from seeing the light of day.
[02:07:19.216 --> 02:07:29.060]  Even more chilling is the fact that the FBI, who apparently get their marching orders from the Clinton syndicate, raided a whistleblower's home recently, as the Daily Caller reported.
[02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:32.521]  16 agents arrived at the home of Dennis Nathan Cain.
[02:07:32.601 --> 02:07:37.363]  The raid was permitted by court orders signed on November 15th by federal magistrate
[02:07:37.603 --> 02:07:39.584]  Stephanie A. Gallagher in the U.S.
[02:07:39.624 --> 02:07:42.886]  District Court for Baltimore and obtained by the Daily Caller.
[02:07:43.106 --> 02:07:52.350]  A special agent from the FBI's Baltimore division who led the raid charged that Cain possessed stolen federal property and demanded entry to his private residence.
[02:07:52.530 --> 02:08:02.375]  Cain's lawyer, Michael Sakara, said Cain informed the agent while he was still at the door that he was a recognized protected whistleblower under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.
[02:08:02.455 --> 02:08:07.821]  And that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz recognized his whistleblower status.
[02:08:07.941 --> 02:08:17.891]  Kane further told the FBI agent the potentially damaging classified information had been properly transmitted to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees as permitted under the act.
[02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:22.795]  The agent immediately directed his agents to begin a sweep of the home anyway.
[02:08:22.955 --> 02:08:32.344]  Cain then promptly handed over the documents, yet even after surrendering that information to the FBI, the agents continued to rummage through the home for six hours.
[02:08:32.564 --> 02:08:37.869]  Cain had come across the potentially explosive information while working for an FBI contractor.
[02:08:37.989 --> 02:08:40.992]  The raid on Cain preceded a scheduled hearing of U.S.
[02:08:41.052 --> 02:08:42.033]  Attorney John Huber.
[02:08:42.273 --> 02:08:42.433]  Which
[02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:23.816]  There was extreme bias in the Department of Justice, the world's premier law enforcement organization, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where tens of thousands of people every day work hard to keep us safe, fight crime, and yet several people near the top of this organization engaged in activities and handling one investigation involving one presidential candidate
[02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:32.978]  Extremely differently, bending over backwards to not find reasons to take action with regard to Hillary Clinton or her employees.
[02:09:33.278 --> 02:09:41.560]  And on the other hand, having insurance policies and secret plans to take action in another area.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:44.561]  Meanwhile, after giving up the fight to dispute a subpoena,
[02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:56.349]  Former FBI Director James Comey goes to the Hill on Friday to privately answer to the House Judiciary Committee for the anti-Trump bias that ran rampant through the upper echelons of the FBI.
[02:09:56.469 --> 02:10:01.253]  His testimony is supposed to be available to the public within 24 hours.
[02:10:01.513 --> 02:10:09.418]  As Bill Priestap, number two intelligence with the FBI on the Russian investigation and Hillary's email scandal, is leaving the FBI.
[02:10:09.498 --> 02:10:11.780]  What this means is that with his departure,
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:18.908]  There are no longer any FBI officials tied to those investigations from the beginning at the department.
[02:10:19.028 --> 02:10:26.456]  The deep state has essentially cleaned up their crime scene after having colluded to take out the executive office of the United States.
[02:10:26.937 --> 02:10:34.782]  Those of us that have conducted federal criminal investigations know that you use the grand jury, you use search warrants, you don't hand out immunities like candy.
[02:10:35.663 --> 02:10:43.088]  Everything in that investigation runs contrary to the way a real, credible, thorough FBI investigation is conducted.
[02:10:43.148 --> 02:10:49.292]  Time is swiftly running out, and the Democrats who have maintained the criminal Clinton narrative are plotting their revenge.
[02:10:49.532 --> 02:10:56.497]  It would be complete folly to pretend that Obama and the Clintons don't have a guiding hand in the coming malevolence.
[02:10:57.117 --> 02:10:58.279]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:11:01.065 --> 02:11:02.647]  Flawless victory.
[02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:03.789]  You want the best?
[02:11:04.935 --> 02:11:08.757]  All right, this is not a fault of the crew, it's the fault of me.
[02:11:09.117 --> 02:11:15.061]  I was looking at my sheet of guests today, so I'm wanting Matt Bracken on as a guest, but Matt Bracken's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:11:16.061 --> 02:11:19.883]  That means, in the balance of this hour, I was wanting to take calls today regardless.
[02:11:20.844 --> 02:11:23.805]  I just can't handle all the sycophantic worship of George H.W.
[02:11:23.845 --> 02:11:24.085]  Bush.
[02:11:24.886 --> 02:11:34.111]  Day after day of him lying in state in different places in this yellow train rolling through the Texas countryside and just how ridiculous it is.
[02:11:35.421 --> 02:11:37.922]  I mean, this Ronald Reagan did not like George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:11:37.942 --> 02:11:42.363]  Nancy Reagan hated him and believed that he was involved in the assassination attempt in 1981.
[02:11:43.823 --> 02:11:46.984]  He was the guy that signed us onto the one-sided deal with China.
[02:11:47.344 --> 02:11:48.844]  He launched all these fake wars.
[02:11:49.344 --> 02:11:51.065]  He was involved in narcotics trafficking.
[02:11:51.105 --> 02:11:52.125]  He was anti-gun.
[02:11:52.425 --> 02:11:54.206]  And one of the NRA basically abolished.
[02:11:56.106 --> 02:11:56.586]  But you know what?
[02:11:57.066 --> 02:11:59.827]  Maybe some of you support George H.W.
[02:11:59.867 --> 02:12:00.047]  Bush.
[02:12:01.226 --> 02:12:03.367]  And all the sycophantic folks we see in D.C.
[02:12:04.167 --> 02:12:06.268]  and down here in Texas worshipping this guy.
[02:12:08.309 --> 02:12:10.310]  But there's added insult to injury.
[02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:20.434]  If I was born in Texas and lived here most of my life and was a blue butt elitist, I wouldn't move to another state and say I was from there as like a political cover.
[02:12:21.874 --> 02:12:25.195]  You know, they say gay guys use a fake wife they're married to as their beard.
[02:12:25.755 --> 02:12:34.598]  Well, he used Texas as his credit that he was some type of good moral guy when his whole family was involved in SNL swindling people with John McCain.
[02:12:34.658 --> 02:12:43.921]  I mean, they are just a group of nasty, corrupt Democrats that love Bill Clinton, call him their son.
[02:12:44.881 --> 02:12:50.943]  And I remember at the time learning that Bush rigged it and basically wanted Bill to win and all the rest of it.
[02:12:52.145 --> 02:13:00.390]  And so they've been sharing power the entire time, and I, for one, am just completely and totally sick of it at every level.
[02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:01.911]  I mean, look at Hillary Clinton here.
[02:13:03.072 --> 02:13:05.253]  Just, if you're a TV viewer, look at the photo.
[02:13:05.294 --> 02:13:07.695]  Let's pull that photo back if we can and take me off screen.
[02:13:08.075 --> 02:13:09.456]  And how she's looking at Trump.
[02:13:09.516 --> 02:13:21.244]  I mean, this woman is absolutely entitled, believes she controls the whole universe, and the globalists were so crazy they thought they would run her, and then America would accept it!
[02:13:22.915 --> 02:13:23.856]  She's a murderer!
[02:13:24.837 --> 02:13:27.139]  She executed the Arab Spring on purpose!
[02:13:27.159 --> 02:13:32.184]  She tried to destabilize the whole Middle East and flood Europe with Islamists!
[02:13:33.225 --> 02:13:35.828]  These people are truly evil.
[02:13:35.848 --> 02:13:39.291]  So I'm going to open the phones up on them plunging the economy by design.
[02:13:40.372 --> 02:13:41.814]  How does the Federal Reserve not get the blame?
[02:13:41.854 --> 02:13:42.755]  Trump warned of all this.
[02:13:42.795 --> 02:13:43.556]  How crazy is it?
[02:13:44.036 --> 02:13:46.398]  How is Trump bad for going to war politically with China?
[02:13:47.179 --> 02:13:49.921]  Who's been raking us over the coals in one-sided trade deals?
[02:13:50.402 --> 02:13:52.623]  Who reportedly has already got them to capitulate to a great extent?
[02:13:52.864 --> 02:13:54.285]  They've now confirmed that's the case?
[02:13:56.667 --> 02:14:00.450]  How are people not siding with Trump and their own self-interest?
[02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:06.875]  How has it become a national religion to hate yourself and hate your country because you think you're pseudo-intellectual and smart?
[02:14:08.816 --> 02:14:11.278]  Because doddering Congresswomen say so.
[02:14:12.339 --> 02:14:13.420]  How did we ever get to this point?
[02:14:14.807 --> 02:14:19.169]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 877-789-2539.
[02:14:19.269 --> 02:14:22.991]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[02:14:23.671 --> 02:14:33.216]  First-time callers, I want to hear your take on George Herbert Walker Bush, and if you are as sick of it as I am, 877-789-2539, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:14:33.296 --> 02:14:34.416]  Now, when we come back,
[02:14:38.809 --> 02:14:45.333]  I mentioned it, but we're going to play the video, because it ties into how to defeat these globalists and what their larger, sickening agenda is.
[02:14:47.534 --> 02:14:55.939]  The perennial loon bat, Alexandra Cortez, says that there's going to be an inevitable global warming government.
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:05.025]  Global governance, that means global government, that will control every facet of your life and bring you the socialist utopia that Venezuela and Russia and China couldn't.
[02:15:06.201 --> 02:15:17.750]  That ties into Macron completely capitulating, and where the yellow vests go from here, this is a way to bring down the EU very, very quickly and decisively.
[02:15:17.770 --> 02:15:19.792]  So this is a very exciting moment in time.
[02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:21.173]  Please stay with us.
[02:15:21.653 --> 02:15:22.474]  This is critical.
[02:15:22.494 --> 02:15:23.735]  And then your phone calls at 877-789-ALEX.
[02:15:26.368 --> 02:15:28.309]  Please, do yourself a favor.
[02:15:28.349 --> 02:15:29.549]  Don't fight the traffic.
[02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:30.630]  Don't fight the malls.
[02:15:30.710 --> 02:15:31.650]  Don't fight all the crud.
[02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:36.693]  Insurers, hell, don't support globalist anti-gunners like Amazon.
[02:15:36.973 --> 02:15:41.355]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get great supplements, great t-shirts, great water filtration, air filtration.
[02:15:41.955 --> 02:15:53.620]  Emergency radios, shortwave radios, optics, survival gear, explorable food, thousands of great items, 50 to 75% off year-end clearance sale, free shipping store-wide, and every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:54.621]  We're all Alex Jones.
[02:15:54.961 --> 02:15:56.682]  Don't censor me, Gadsden flag shirt.
[02:15:57.142 --> 02:16:00.923]  This is beyond our best deal ever, and it's ending in just a few days.
[02:16:06.414 --> 02:16:14.878]  I've been on air 23 plus years and I've learned a lot about sales because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution, Bill of Rights and our way of life.
[02:16:15.698 --> 02:16:20.261]  I was never classically trained but over the last 23 years I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[02:16:20.961 --> 02:16:26.243]  Now there's lots of philosophies about have something really really expensive and a certain percentage will buy it believing it's the best.
[02:16:27.044 --> 02:16:27.964]  That's not what I do.
[02:16:28.765 --> 02:16:31.306]  I try to find the very best products that are popular
[02:16:32.186 --> 02:16:35.027]  Get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[02:16:35.107 --> 02:16:36.287]  That seems to be like common sense.
[02:16:36.407 --> 02:16:44.690]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:51.992]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, water filtration, gravity-fed systems, because they're the very best.
[02:16:52.112 --> 02:16:56.733]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price, and so we are the biggest distributor.
[02:16:56.933 --> 02:16:59.974]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[02:17:00.814 --> 02:17:03.455]  Of 127 on that water filtration system.
[02:17:04.035 --> 02:17:05.656]  Because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[02:17:05.796 --> 02:17:06.896]  We sold out of it.
[02:17:06.916 --> 02:17:08.157]  They didn't think we could do it.
[02:17:08.777 --> 02:17:09.377]  You responded.
[02:17:09.397 --> 02:17:10.397]  You went and did your own research.
[02:17:10.657 --> 02:17:11.778]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[02:17:12.278 --> 02:17:16.980]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration four-stage ion filter.
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:20.601]  When they came to me five years ago and said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[02:17:20.621 --> 02:17:21.561]  Leading competitors are $500, $600, $800, $1,000.
[02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:23.622]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[02:17:23.642 --> 02:17:24.402]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[02:17:24.442 --> 02:17:24.702]  I said, great.
[02:17:24.722 --> 02:17:25.002]  Absolutely.
[02:17:25.062 --> 02:17:26.023]  I just bought filters for $400.
[02:17:29.704 --> 02:17:30.304]  We're good to go!
[02:18:02.828 --> 02:18:10.116]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:18:11.812 --> 02:18:14.814]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:18:14.954 --> 02:18:16.995]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:18:17.616 --> 02:18:21.458]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:18:21.918 --> 02:18:29.263]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:18:29.283 --> 02:18:31.825]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:18:35.265 --> 02:18:37.467]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:18:37.487 --> 02:18:40.649]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:18:40.909 --> 02:18:51.657]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.

[02:19:35.529 --> 02:19:36.130]  But guess what?

[02:20:05.959 --> 02:20:12.185]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.947 --> 02:20:16.669]  Well, I was summoned from Montgomery.
[02:20:16.689 --> 02:20:19.111]  I had my guitar on my back.
[02:20:20.953 --> 02:20:24.556]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:20:25.657 --> 02:20:30.482]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:20:33.845 --> 02:20:38.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:38.648 --> 02:20:44.352]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:44.392 --> 02:20:48.675]  Alright, I'm going to break something down here for radio and TV viewers.
[02:20:48.755 --> 02:20:50.056]  It's very paradoxical.
[02:20:51.437 --> 02:20:57.100]  And it shows how evil gets good to come out and basically support it.
[02:20:58.894 --> 02:21:11.359]  George Herbert Walker Bush, from the time he got out of World War II, he was in World War II, you know, he served quasi-honorably, did everything he could to hand this country over to the globalists.
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:20.763]  And if you're a TV viewer, you can see our satellite feed from the train going from Spring, Texas to College Station.
[02:21:22.293 --> 02:21:46.639]  Knowing that this demographic is mainly Fox News viewers, knowing that it's a lot of conservatives in that area, and knowing that they love America, and so they've seen five, six days of total hype as if Jesus Christ himself just died, and they're buying into the reboot that George Herbert Walker Bush is this great patriot, and they're holding up their Texas flags, they're holding up their American flags, because they're saying to Hollywood,
[02:21:47.924 --> 02:21:52.629]  CNN and all the America haters who say don't hold up American flags and don't love your president.
[02:21:52.849 --> 02:21:54.771]  They're saying we love America, we love our president.
[02:21:56.813 --> 02:21:58.275]  So what they're doing is good.
[02:21:58.355 --> 02:21:59.396]  What they're doing is loving.
[02:21:59.436 --> 02:22:00.678]  They're doing it for a good reason.
[02:22:00.698 --> 02:22:01.859]  These are good Texas people.
[02:22:03.801 --> 02:22:12.208]  And they chose this last parade route through areas of College Station and other areas where it's seen that George Herbert Walker Bush is this great Texan.
[02:22:12.248 --> 02:22:17.792]  I mean, not just his ancestors, he fought at the Alamo and was the only male survivor.
[02:22:17.812 --> 02:22:20.034]  That's right.
[02:22:20.574 --> 02:22:26.159]  Just like Soros cut off Hitler's head, he wasn't only a Nazi collaborator, he killed Hitler himself in the bunker.
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:29.202]  George Herbert Walker Bush founded Texas.
[02:22:30.336 --> 02:22:32.077]  They weren't carpetbaggers from Europe.
[02:22:32.117 --> 02:22:33.997]  They weren't bluebloods that helped the Nazis.
[02:22:34.418 --> 02:22:40.340]  They didn't come down here and run swindle jobs and scams at every level.
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:42.041]  They're not known criminals, which they are.
[02:22:42.841 --> 02:22:43.581]  No, no, no, no.
[02:22:44.061 --> 02:22:46.823]  SNL scams, oil scams, CIA scams.
[02:22:47.363 --> 02:22:47.963]  No, no, no, no.
[02:22:48.083 --> 02:22:49.003]  They're Texans.
[02:22:49.103 --> 02:22:55.246]  So now we get this warmonger, this liar, this globalist, this anti-gunner hung around our necks.
[02:22:57.961 --> 02:23:17.387]  And watching Fox News earlier in another feed, they were just sycophantically saying they're getting chills watching George Herbert Walker Bush on this train ride for one more PR stunt being taken to his resting place at College Station.
[02:23:17.627 --> 02:23:20.208]  And College Station used to be, A&M used to be conservative.
[02:23:21.248 --> 02:23:22.268]  My dad's dad went there.
[02:23:23.189 --> 02:23:24.049]  His brothers went there.
[02:23:25.797 --> 02:23:29.020]  A&M now basically is as leftist as UT.
[02:23:30.421 --> 02:23:35.225]  And has the very same classes that the family's bad and guns are bad and everything else.
[02:23:35.305 --> 02:23:40.569]  I mean, it's not all bad, but that's definitely what they're doing since he took it over.
[02:23:44.152 --> 02:23:49.216]  So this is just one more time we have to have this guy rubbed in our faces.
[02:23:49.576 --> 02:23:50.958]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now.
[02:23:51.498 --> 02:23:52.499]  Before I end the hour, I'll
[02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:59.133]  Get into the whole world government carbon tax situation, how much trouble that is in in France.
[02:23:59.173 --> 02:24:02.774]  But since we're on the subject of George Walker Bush, I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:24:03.594 --> 02:24:09.256]  In fact, when he died last Friday, I thought, well, maybe I'll just say something nice just to take the high road.
[02:24:09.276 --> 02:24:10.136]  But that's not the high road.
[02:24:11.417 --> 02:24:12.157]  That'd be lying.
[02:24:14.478 --> 02:24:21.040]  And now the idea that this consummate New World Order, anti-gun, open border, globalist,
[02:24:22.483 --> 02:24:25.704]  That Bill Clinton calls his father and he calls Bill his son.
[02:24:25.724 --> 02:24:32.786]  And all the things they've done to this country and the corrupt Washington establishment that has sold this nation out.
[02:24:33.747 --> 02:24:43.310]  And then after six days, what is it, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, you know, after six days of, seven days of constant endless worship,
[02:24:47.159 --> 02:25:05.655]  They get enough hype going to get my fellow Texans to come out and believe they're supporting Americana when that devilish counterfeit is riding along in a red, white, and blue train and he's been the conductor driving this country straight to hell.
[02:25:07.543 --> 02:25:09.384]  He signed the one-sided trade deals with China.
[02:25:09.784 --> 02:25:11.065]  He made the strategic deals.
[02:25:11.545 --> 02:25:12.626]  He sold the country out.
[02:25:13.106 --> 02:25:15.848]  He helped the Clintons transfer missile technology to North Korea and China.
[02:25:16.148 --> 02:25:17.349]  He did it all.
[02:25:18.849 --> 02:25:21.751]  And now, he steals the identity of an American patriot.
[02:25:22.211 --> 02:25:24.032]  He steals the identity of being a Texan.
[02:25:26.634 --> 02:25:27.854]  And he craps all over us.
[02:25:30.036 --> 02:25:31.296]  And we're supposed to worship him.
[02:25:31.957 --> 02:25:33.978]  Well, I'm not doing it.
[02:25:37.657 --> 02:25:40.779]  Let's talk to Doug in Connecticut, which is a great state.
[02:25:40.819 --> 02:25:41.900]  I'm not bashing people in Connecticut.
[02:25:42.341 --> 02:25:43.661]  I'm just saying that's where Bush comes from.
[02:25:43.682 --> 02:25:47.604]  I don't know why he's not getting married up in Connecticut, brother, but I guess you guys probably don't want him.
[02:25:47.845 --> 02:25:48.965]  What do you make of all this, Doug?
[02:25:49.986 --> 02:26:03.076]  Well, Alex, it's the first time we've talked, by the way, but I'm sick of it, more sick of it than you are, maybe, being from Connecticut, the Constitution State, by the way, which is, I guess, why maybe they trashed it so much with our gun laws being passed.
[02:26:03.096 --> 02:26:05.998]  Well, it's definitely a beautiful state, but it is the bluest of the blue, my friend.
[02:26:06.038 --> 02:26:06.899]  How do you handle it up there?
[02:26:07.782 --> 02:26:08.522]  Not very well.
[02:26:08.742 --> 02:26:10.103]  I'm a retired police officer.
[02:26:10.123 --> 02:26:14.304]  I got to wait for my wife to retire in another nine years from being a teacher, then we're out of here, you know?
[02:26:14.984 --> 02:26:16.684]  But, uh, I got four kids as well.
[02:26:16.724 --> 02:26:17.685]  I'm raising them, right?
[02:26:17.705 --> 02:26:19.445]  We watch it every night right here in the kitchen.
[02:26:19.965 --> 02:26:21.366]  Sometimes I got to turn down the volume.
[02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:28.628]  But, uh, regardless, you know, this parading of Bush here, it just makes me think of the Bible, you know?
[02:26:29.068 --> 02:26:33.369]  I mean, if this was Christ, I mean, they wouldn't do this for Christ, you know what I mean?
[02:26:34.439 --> 02:26:35.159]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:26:35.199 --> 02:26:37.480]  In fact, they had to sneak off with his body.
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:38.841]  I mean, they sped all over him.
[02:26:38.901 --> 02:26:39.341]  Exactly.
[02:26:39.621 --> 02:26:41.482]  The world is worshiping this.
[02:26:41.842 --> 02:26:42.943]  The world is propping it up.
[02:26:42.963 --> 02:26:43.623]  And I apologize.
[02:26:43.643 --> 02:26:44.743]  You know, this is a family show.
[02:26:45.143 --> 02:26:56.808]  And now that I have to cover what two-year-olds and five-year-olds are taught in public schools, I have to say the most horrible things on earth, which I would never say, but parents have to know what's going on.
[02:26:57.568 --> 02:27:01.290]  So I apologize that sometimes we say some really horrible things here on air.
[02:27:01.330 --> 02:27:03.551]  The problem is, I'm just reading what's going on.
[02:27:04.851 --> 02:27:06.272]  I have no problem with it.
[02:27:06.992 --> 02:27:08.493]  My son's the one in the kitchen at the time.
[02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:09.053]  He's 12.
[02:27:09.113 --> 02:27:12.015]  My youngest, she's 8, but I keep it in control.
[02:27:12.035 --> 02:27:18.157]  It's even hard to listen to, but I don't want you to cover it, but you have to cover it because it has to get out in the consciousness.
[02:27:19.678 --> 02:27:21.059]  I wasn't taking you as a criticism.
[02:27:21.119 --> 02:27:23.200]  I just said I feel dirty when I do it.
[02:27:24.418 --> 02:27:36.865]  Listen, we've got footage we shot in Austin of men with two and three and four year old kids with glitter on their open genitals hugging them at trans events that the public is attending.
[02:27:37.045 --> 02:27:43.688]  I mean, I can't show on television, because we're on TV stations, and I can't show what is being done to kids.
[02:27:43.969 --> 02:27:46.370]  Again, this is insane how far they've gone.
[02:27:48.061 --> 02:27:51.243]  ...multiple times and I told my wife, I said, I'm retired.
[02:27:51.363 --> 02:27:52.103]  I'm home.
[02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:57.726]  So if that costs her the school, I said, I'm going to get to the school and it's going to get ugly and it's just going to have to happen.
[02:27:57.746 --> 02:28:04.130]  But one thing that just jotted my mind, uh, Connecticut, apparently every year has a thing called Connecticut Kid Governor.
[02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:06.111]  I don't know if every state does it, but they do here.
[02:28:06.831 --> 02:28:14.876]  And their kid governor for this year, now mind you, there was kids that wanted to talk about, uh, climate, disease, uh, bullying and whatnot.
[02:28:15.656 --> 02:28:16.897]  This kid is a, uh,
[02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:19.035]  A tranny, whatever the hell.
[02:28:19.055 --> 02:28:21.516]  Not a tranny, but a lesbian, I guess.
[02:28:22.176 --> 02:28:27.998]  It's a girl that totally makes herself up to look like Spanky there from Little Rascal.
[02:28:28.018 --> 02:28:28.838]  That's what she reminds me of.
[02:28:29.438 --> 02:28:32.719]  And this is a kid, Alex, in fifth grade.
[02:28:33.719 --> 02:28:37.280]  And the Avon Connecticut school system's pointed on the news.
[02:28:38.506 --> 02:28:41.670]  And the news is putting this out, and I'm not... Exactly!
[02:28:41.930 --> 02:28:47.617]  They're force-feeding the LGBT sexualization of children everywhere.
[02:28:47.637 --> 02:28:48.758]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:28:48.838 --> 02:28:52.042]  It is diabolical, it's pure evil, and it's our line in the sand.
[02:28:52.082 --> 02:28:53.003]  Doug, God bless you.
[02:28:53.323 --> 02:28:54.064]  We appreciate you.
[02:28:54.084 --> 02:28:54.925]  Thanks for your great points.
[02:28:54.965 --> 02:28:55.346]  We'll be back.

[02:31:50.342 --> 02:31:52.687]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.

[02:33:06.934 --> 02:33:11.516]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:28.761]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:29.381 --> 02:33:31.102]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.182 --> 02:33:58.147]  We've got a live satellite feed for TV viewers.
[02:33:58.227 --> 02:33:59.927]  Maybe put that back up there.
[02:33:59.967 --> 02:34:00.647]  Pretty powerful.
[02:34:00.947 --> 02:34:06.509]  Of George Herbert Walker Bush being driven through the Texas countryside.
[02:34:08.166 --> 02:34:22.853]  To Texas A&M University, that since it went under his name and his library has gone from being a patriotic pro-US organization to more and more being just another leftist controlled hell pit.
[02:34:24.534 --> 02:34:27.095]  It's very, very sad to see A&M going that direction.
[02:34:27.555 --> 02:34:35.259]  And you've got all these Americans out, all these Texans, who have seen the last six days of worship
[02:34:36.092 --> 02:35:02.853]  Wanting this to be their chance to wave Texas flags and American flags and there's big American flags all over this special train that has a big plexiglass window so you can see the coffin wrapped to the American flag when the entire Carnegie Rockefeller program is now courts ruling no American flags, courts ruling nationalism's bad, the Bush family saying Trump's bad when he says we are a nation.
[02:35:03.874 --> 02:35:05.275]  It's okay to be nationalist.
[02:35:06.687 --> 02:35:11.129]  So everything he's now wrapped in is what he's diametrically opposed to.
[02:35:11.409 --> 02:35:17.993]  So he worked his whole modern adult life for world government, almost saw the country defeated.
[02:35:18.033 --> 02:35:20.994]  We're still not back from the dead yet, but hopefully we'll make it.
[02:35:21.995 --> 02:35:25.617]  And now we have this breathlessness of the reporters.
[02:35:26.704 --> 02:35:32.592]  Who are really just actors that, I guess, couldn't make it in Hollywood, breathlessly talking about how amazing he is.
[02:35:32.613 --> 02:35:36.859]  Here, let's just duck into a few minutes of Fox News, and then we'll go to your phone calls.
[02:35:36.899 --> 02:35:39.542]  Here's a few minutes from the live Fox News feed we're showing.
[02:35:40.939 --> 02:35:46.383]  Oil prices are lower at about $51 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate.
[02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:48.004]  That is not good news.
[02:35:48.325 --> 02:35:51.167]  People think that's a proxy for the broader economies, right?
[02:35:51.487 --> 02:35:54.890]  If oil prices are going down, does that mean demand is going down too?
[02:35:54.910 --> 02:35:57.392]  I know, speaking of the economy, there are
[02:35:58.132 --> 02:36:05.857]  Technical indicators that are really difficult to read that are now pointing possibly to recession, some people say.
[02:36:07.078 --> 02:36:08.299]  An inverted yield curve.
[02:36:08.379 --> 02:36:09.360]  I hate to use the words on your show.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:13.923]  Let's cut back to our satellite feed, which is a better feed.
[02:36:14.163 --> 02:36:15.544]  There you go.
[02:36:16.265 --> 02:36:23.610]  So earlier they were breathlessly talking about Bush, but notice, oh, the private Federal Reserve says we're going to raise interest rates.
[02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:24.670]  It won't hurt the economy.
[02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:25.511]  Trump's wrong.
[02:36:26.653 --> 02:36:29.934]  They do it, it hurts the economy, like they knew it would.
[02:36:29.974 --> 02:36:33.154]  They go, oh, it's Trump, or it's these complex indicators.
[02:36:33.615 --> 02:36:43.217]  They don't want nationalism to be associated with better trade deals, more money, more jobs, industry.
[02:36:45.537 --> 02:36:46.157]  They admit that.
[02:36:47.178 --> 02:36:49.218]  That's why Bill Maher said, what, four months ago?
[02:36:50.118 --> 02:36:51.338]  He said, the economy has been better?
[02:36:52.299 --> 02:36:53.179]  It's exploding?
[02:36:54.201 --> 02:36:55.902]  It's going to go to six, seven, eight percent growth rate.
[02:36:55.922 --> 02:36:56.582]  We can't let this.
[02:36:56.622 --> 02:37:00.344]  We've got to have a plunge in the economy so that Trump looks bad.
[02:37:01.625 --> 02:37:12.550]  And now I've got articles where Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are trying to spike the Italian economy to get rid of the nationalist president who's blocked the open borders.
[02:37:14.514 --> 02:37:16.416]  They're trying to plunge other economies.
[02:37:16.436 --> 02:37:24.022]  They've been trying to prop up the French economy because he'd be the first to put in the giant carbon tax of 25% per liter.
[02:37:24.722 --> 02:37:31.628]  Add it on to the 5 plus euros that you'd pay for each liter.
[02:37:32.348 --> 02:37:33.129]  Even more money.
[02:37:33.169 --> 02:37:34.510]  Can you imagine that?
[02:37:36.432 --> 02:37:37.232]  But here's the good news.
[02:37:38.193 --> 02:37:39.194]  And I'll cover it next segment.
[02:37:40.253 --> 02:37:45.015]  Macron submits to yellow vest rebellion, cancels fuel tax hike indefinitely.
[02:37:46.356 --> 02:37:55.880]  That's the French people demonstrating, not robbing and stealing like the Islamists when they riot, but actually taking action and the corrupt globalist government folding.
[02:37:58.921 --> 02:38:02.423]  But here's a new article, just went up on Infowars.com.
[02:38:04.741 --> 02:38:05.361]  Farage.
[02:38:06.282 --> 02:38:07.322]  It's a Kit Daniels article.
[02:38:07.802 --> 02:38:14.144]  Macron versus signals the whole world wall disconnected from the French people.
[02:38:16.205 --> 02:38:17.685]  He's wildly unpopular.
[02:38:19.886 --> 02:38:32.130]  But I bet if he died, though, of old age many years from now and they had six days of coverage, maybe some French farmers would forget about it and line the way waving their French flags, believing the anti-Frenchman was actually the Frenchman.
[02:38:35.595 --> 02:38:39.297]  No amount of media hype, no amount of designer suits will change that fact.
[02:38:41.618 --> 02:38:43.059]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:47.101]  Let's talk to James in Virginia.
[02:38:47.121 --> 02:38:48.102]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:38:50.143 --> 02:38:50.643]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:51.824 --> 02:38:52.104]  Welcome.
[02:38:53.265 --> 02:38:55.045]  I'm a long-time listener, first-time call.
[02:38:55.306 --> 02:38:55.986]  Welcome.
[02:38:56.766 --> 02:38:59.488]  I just wanted to support you in kind of dumping on H.W.
[02:39:00.168 --> 02:39:02.409]  Bush, because the guy was pure evil.
[02:39:04.093 --> 02:39:07.014]  You know, he didn't coin the term NWO, but he put it out there.
[02:39:07.934 --> 02:39:12.335]  He mentioned Thousand Points of Light, you know, the chandelier room in the Mothers of Darkness castle.
[02:39:12.715 --> 02:39:16.476]  I mean, who would know that back then unless he was just pure evil?
[02:39:16.576 --> 02:39:19.177]  I mean, he was a real terrible person.
[02:39:21.618 --> 02:39:25.579]  Well, there's no doubt that he was a devil worshiper.
[02:39:26.559 --> 02:39:32.421]  There's no doubt that he engaged in bizarre sexual rituals.
[02:39:33.633 --> 02:39:39.817]  There's no doubt that his entire adult life after World War II was one act of evil after the next.
[02:39:42.159 --> 02:39:47.142]  I don't think it's wrong to dump on him then, because he never contributed anything positive to the world.
[02:39:48.423 --> 02:39:51.024]  What is at stake is more than one small country.
[02:39:51.765 --> 02:39:52.625]  It's a big idea.
[02:39:52.645 --> 02:39:54.066]  A new world order.
[02:39:55.007 --> 02:40:02.692]  To achieve the universal aspirations of mankind based on shared principles and the rule of law, the illumination of a thousand points of light,
[02:40:03.916 --> 02:40:05.677]  The winds of change are with us now.
[02:40:06.738 --> 02:40:08.619]  When we're successful, and we will be.
[02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:10.440]  You know, isn't it emblematic?
[02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:17.724]  Why do you think David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, John McCain, George Walker Bush, and a whole bunch of other globalists all died this year?
[02:40:17.744 --> 02:40:21.907]  I think it's emblematic, an omen of the death of their world government plan.
[02:40:23.628 --> 02:40:24.008]  I agree.
[02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:26.809]  It's fishy, even.
[02:40:29.871 --> 02:40:31.912]  Well, they're all very, very old and long in the tooth.
[02:40:33.484 --> 02:40:42.647]  It's just George Herbert Walker Bush was a globalist, leftist, elitist, who swindled people everywhere he was.
[02:40:42.707 --> 02:40:44.987]  His dad swindled people, his dad swindled people.
[02:40:45.628 --> 02:40:47.708]  They came from a group of really nasty criminals.
[02:40:49.189 --> 02:40:54.450]  And I'm just so sick of hearing about these social climbing trash as if they're God.
[02:40:54.470 --> 02:40:57.631]  And I am a little sad for my fellow Texans, but they're good people.
[02:40:58.643 --> 02:41:11.126]  Who are so sick of America being walked on, and so sick of this global government project that Bush headed up that makes you feel bad to be an American, that now that they've wrapped him in the American flag to fool us, they're out there worshipping him.
[02:41:11.186 --> 02:41:11.846]  It's pretty shameful.
[02:41:12.746 --> 02:41:18.808]  His whole funeral, I guess you would call it, the whole thing is a giant satanic ritual.
[02:41:19.768 --> 02:41:20.268]  Undoubtedly.
[02:41:21.428 --> 02:41:22.049]  You're right, James.
[02:41:22.109 --> 02:41:23.009]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:23.029 --> 02:41:23.909]  I'm going to be a good boy.
[02:41:24.209 --> 02:41:27.310]  When we come back, we're going to go to all the other callers very, very quickly.
[02:41:28.450 --> 02:41:32.352]  We'll continue, and I'll introduce Matt Bracken coming up as well.
[02:41:32.932 --> 02:41:34.593]  This is not about speaking out on the dead.
[02:41:34.613 --> 02:41:36.534]  In fact, I don't like doing it.
[02:41:36.554 --> 02:41:39.055]  I thought it was very sad when George W. Bush cried about his father.
[02:41:39.435 --> 02:41:41.016]  That shows some humanity by these people.
[02:41:41.036 --> 02:41:48.380]  But when you look at how they overthrow our allies and put radical Islamists in, and just all the bad things they've done, I must tell the truth.
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.240]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:41:50.301 --> 02:41:50.761]  Stay with us.
[02:41:53.582 --> 02:41:55.043]  What are champions made of?
[02:41:56.933 --> 02:41:58.065]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:42:04.248 --> 02:42:05.329]  We're 55% off right now.
[02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:06.530]  This is from Eliot Kelly.
[02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.690]  Wait!
[02:42:30.852 --> 02:42:34.013]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:42:34.313 --> 02:42:37.614]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.

[02:42:39.574 --> 02:42:41.335]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:41.395 --> 02:42:45.576]  And right now we got the biggest sales ever and free t-shirts with every order.
[02:42:45.616 --> 02:42:47.676]  No deal like it ever in our history.
[02:42:47.736 --> 02:42:48.616]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:02.904 --> 02:43:08.827]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[02:43:09.027 --> 02:43:15.190]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:18.011]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[02:43:18.231 --> 02:43:21.654]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[02:43:21.955 --> 02:43:28.161]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[02:43:28.421 --> 02:43:34.487]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[02:43:34.987 --> 02:43:41.990]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:49.113]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[02:43:49.313 --> 02:43:53.695]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[02:43:54.175 --> 02:44:01.539]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:44:02.731 --> 02:44:06.154]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:44:06.174 --> 02:44:09.457]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:09.977 --> 02:44:15.762]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:16.242 --> 02:44:19.005]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:19.745 --> 02:44:23.189]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:29.636]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:30.037 --> 02:44:35.002]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:35.751 --> 02:44:39.173]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:39.673 --> 02:44:46.217]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:46.877 --> 02:44:51.480]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:57.205]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:57.786 --> 02:45:01.769]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:45:02.310 --> 02:45:08.335]  The scientists at InfoWars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:45:08.696 --> 02:45:11.298]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with BODYS.
[02:45:11.919 --> 02:45:15.362]  BODYS contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:45:15.622 --> 02:45:17.704]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years.
[02:45:17.904 --> 02:45:19.844]  And is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:45:20.304 --> 02:45:23.565]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:45:24.465 --> 02:45:34.687]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:45:35.447 --> 02:45:40.048]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients.
[02:45:40.508 --> 02:45:43.989]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[02:45:45.629 --> 02:45:54.179]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:58.964]  Try Bodies today at Infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:46:02.388 --> 02:46:10.615]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:46:10.816 --> 02:46:12.037]  Believe me, I know.
[02:46:12.057 --> 02:46:16.601]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:46:17.021 --> 02:46:20.084]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:46:20.584 --> 02:46:22.046]  I still have that energy.
[02:46:22.266 --> 02:46:42.527]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:46:43.007 --> 02:46:46.769]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:46:47.029 --> 02:46:50.431]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:46:50.711 --> 02:46:55.234]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:46:55.734 --> 02:46:57.715]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:46:58.476 --> 02:47:01.517]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:08.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.065 --> 02:47:19.467]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:19.627 --> 02:47:25.010]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:47:25.130 --> 02:47:27.232]  Let's go back to this feed, our satellite feed.
[02:47:28.293 --> 02:47:31.054]  For TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll spare you.
[02:47:33.056 --> 02:47:34.297]  George H.W.
[02:47:34.317 --> 02:47:34.717]  Bush.
[02:47:35.357 --> 02:47:37.499]  I mean, the Democrat in Republican clothing.
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:41.802]  The open border anti-gun, Mr. New World Order.
[02:47:42.542 --> 02:47:43.923]  Bill Clinton's favorite person.
[02:47:43.983 --> 02:47:45.064]  Call Bill Clinton his son.
[02:47:47.566 --> 02:47:51.869]  An unpopular president, and now there's this weird nostalgia.
[02:47:52.890 --> 02:47:56.492]  Twenty-five years after he was out of office?
[02:47:57.753 --> 02:47:59.714]  Twenty-six years after he was out of office?
[02:47:59.894 --> 02:48:02.716]  It is like... I mean, Ronald Reagan was a great president.
[02:48:02.736 --> 02:48:04.697]  They didn't do one-tenth of this.
[02:48:04.877 --> 02:48:05.918]  Six days?
[02:48:07.919 --> 02:48:10.161]  And just highways shut down and everything else?
[02:48:10.381 --> 02:48:16.225]  I mean, if Trump can turn the country around and get the country back, and it's successful, I would still say this is a little bit overboard.
[02:48:17.281 --> 02:48:22.026]  But this is the guy that almost killed the country, and we don't know if we're going to make it out of this yet.
[02:48:23.547 --> 02:48:24.968]  This is the whole UN agenda.
[02:48:25.949 --> 02:48:35.098]  I was thinking during a break about how they're targeting kids two years old now, confusing what sex they are, and then the parents say, hey, don't do that, they take your kid away.
[02:48:35.118 --> 02:48:39.622]  We're going to have folks in studio next Monday on that subject.
[02:48:39.822 --> 02:48:40.683]  Big shows next week.
[02:48:43.308 --> 02:48:45.089]  This all went on under this guy's watch.
[02:48:45.149 --> 02:48:48.450]  I mean, he's Mr. World Government, Mr. New World Order.
[02:48:48.910 --> 02:48:51.391]  I know our audience knows that, but this is next level.
[02:48:53.011 --> 02:48:55.332]  But again, this is Fox News viewers.
[02:48:56.172 --> 02:49:05.355]  They're all told, go out, do this, and they picked her out in Texas of conservatives, good people, and there they are, saluting the enemy of the country.
[02:49:06.906 --> 02:49:10.389]  And that's why they don't want me on air, because I would wake up those conservatives.
[02:49:11.150 --> 02:49:12.431]  Hell, I got family right in that area.
[02:49:13.292 --> 02:49:13.773]  They're awake.
[02:49:14.013 --> 02:49:18.577]  I would wake those people up if they just heard the truth about this guy, but they don't remember.
[02:49:18.597 --> 02:49:21.580]  I remember one time, I was in a gun shop.
[02:49:22.526 --> 02:49:37.571]  And they had like some memorial handgun, 45, George W. Bush company made, and I said, you don't know why you'd make a gun like that, the guy is for assault weapons bans, so that means all semi-auto, this handgun will be banned, if they had their way.
[02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:44.091]  One guy behind the counter goes, don't you tell lies, Jones.
[02:49:44.111 --> 02:49:44.732]  You know who I was.
[02:49:44.752 --> 02:49:46.153]  It was at McBride's.
[02:49:46.173 --> 02:49:48.714]  He goes, don't you tell lies, Jones.
[02:49:48.914 --> 02:49:49.955]  That's not true.
[02:49:50.035 --> 02:49:50.475]  He wasn't.
[02:49:50.515 --> 02:49:52.076]  And then the owner goes, no, that's true.
[02:49:52.576 --> 02:49:54.037]  They started arguing out on the computer.
[02:49:54.057 --> 02:49:55.017]  This was like 10 years ago.
[02:49:55.097 --> 02:49:56.218]  Got on the laptop, pulled it up.
[02:49:56.438 --> 02:49:57.499]  Well, I didn't know that.
[02:49:57.859 --> 02:49:58.839]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:49:58.859 --> 02:50:00.160]  You didn't know quite a bit.
[02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:01.241]  His daddy
[02:50:03.177 --> 02:50:07.338]  One of the NRA abolished, so you go ahead and cheer it all day, because Fox News told you.
[02:50:07.898 --> 02:50:14.200]  They are the corrupt establishment, the dying media, trying to hold on to power, and they'll never do it.
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:15.300]  America's awakened.
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:17.660]  There's going to be a long process, but we're done.
[02:50:17.681 --> 02:50:25.362]  We got a lot of callers here.
[02:50:26.463 --> 02:50:29.723]  Let's talk to Chris, then we'll go to Brandon and Tom.
[02:50:30.164 --> 02:50:31.624]  Chris in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[02:50:31.644 --> 02:50:31.944]  Go ahead.
[02:50:33.610 --> 02:50:36.613]  Hi Alex Jones, first time caller, long time listener.
[02:50:37.453 --> 02:50:43.418]  Uh, actually you were talking about these banks trying to, you know, crush the country.
[02:50:43.458 --> 02:50:43.658]  Yes.
[02:50:43.859 --> 02:50:51.265]  Even though when Obama was running these deficits, he had zero percent interest the entire time and trillions printed.
[02:50:51.925 --> 02:50:54.267]  I think the main problem is that bank.
[02:50:55.148 --> 02:51:02.494]  What Trump needs to do, whenever it happens, you know, to clear that soft, uh, I don't know if he's going to do it and arrest the deep state, but if he does,
[02:51:03.197 --> 02:51:12.360]  A good idea would be to go in and, I don't know, take the central bank and pay all the debts on them.
[02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:13.200]  They're the ones who print it.
[02:51:13.220 --> 02:51:14.501]  They're the ones who are controlling it all.
[02:51:14.901 --> 02:51:16.161]  Well, exactly.
[02:51:16.181 --> 02:51:16.822]  But here's what happened.
[02:51:18.322 --> 02:51:23.004]  They gave tens of trillions of dollars to private select interest, zero percent interest.
[02:51:23.942 --> 02:51:27.084]  Out of the bailout that started in 2008, 10 years ago, right through.
[02:51:27.664 --> 02:51:33.747]  As soon as Trump got in, he said, continue that policy, but flood the real economy with currency.
[02:51:34.407 --> 02:51:42.932]  Now, the establishment said that'll cause inflation, but Trump knows, and his advisors are telling him, China and the EU are in a currency devaluation race.
[02:51:43.732 --> 02:51:52.858]  So the only way, this is already happening, so you might as well get some factories back for strategic reasons and let some folks pay down some debt and use inflation.
[02:51:52.918 --> 02:51:58.201]  He writes about this in several books, so does his good friend Rich Dad Poor Dad.
[02:51:58.842 --> 02:52:06.066]  If you're going to go down this road, well then he was going to give us the cheap money and let us pay off debt, student loans, and buy houses and things.
[02:52:07.427 --> 02:52:09.629]  You're damned if you do, you're damned if we don't, but now
[02:52:11.363 --> 02:52:15.946]  They're getting rid of that cheap money for the public to kill that, and they're saying America's not open for business.
[02:52:16.447 --> 02:52:17.327]  You're absolutely right.
[02:52:17.407 --> 02:52:26.473]  This is being done, they admit it's being done, strategically against Italy, the United States, England, and others, where the big banks threaten them.
[02:52:27.494 --> 02:52:29.716]  Openly say, you don't stay in the EU,
[02:52:31.786 --> 02:52:33.287]  We're going to cause a stock market crash.
[02:52:33.968 --> 02:52:38.031]  And they even told him, we're going to do it in the middle of December.
[02:52:38.071 --> 02:52:39.392]  Well, it's already begun.
[02:52:39.472 --> 02:52:43.956]  So, they're doing this, and the point is, it's rigged, and Trump understands and knows.
[02:52:43.996 --> 02:52:44.977]  We have the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.
[02:52:45.397 --> 02:52:46.919]  It's not federal, it's private.
[02:52:47.379 --> 02:52:50.542]  He can go in there with presidential power and take that thing over with executive orders.
[02:52:50.882 --> 02:52:52.163]  His advisors tell him he can't.
[02:52:52.403 --> 02:52:54.085]  His advisors are a bunch of damn liars.
[02:52:54.605 --> 02:53:00.030]  Look at Rosenstein, set up a new chain of command in the Justice Department outside the President.
[02:53:00.976 --> 02:53:03.418]  And the media said, oh, you can't change it or you'll get arrested.
[02:53:03.478 --> 02:53:04.619]  No, he's the president.
[02:53:04.839 --> 02:53:07.942]  How is Rosenstein or Mueller more powerful than the president?
[02:53:08.122 --> 02:53:08.722]  They're not!
[02:53:09.003 --> 02:53:15.268]  They're criminal, white-shoe boy, dirtbag lawyers that think they're God and have been raping this country forever.
[02:53:15.588 --> 02:53:16.349]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:16.369 --> 02:53:19.351]  I'm getting angry right now.
[02:53:19.371 --> 02:53:22.934]  I know exactly what they're doing.
[02:53:24.841 --> 02:53:29.922]  Let's talk to Brandon in Georgia, then we'll go to Dave, Danny, Grant, and many others.
[02:53:29.962 --> 02:53:30.242]  Go ahead.
[02:53:30.262 --> 02:53:30.902]  You're on the air, Brandon.
[02:53:32.023 --> 02:53:33.043]  Hey, what's going on, buddy?
[02:53:33.183 --> 02:53:33.823]  Merry Christmas.
[02:53:33.983 --> 02:53:34.703]  Merry Christmas to you.
[02:53:34.723 --> 02:53:35.324]  Good to have you here.
[02:53:35.344 --> 02:53:36.864]  What's on your mind?
[02:53:37.004 --> 02:53:37.144]  Oh, man.
[02:53:37.164 --> 02:53:38.364]  Well, here's the thing, man.
[02:53:39.064 --> 02:53:44.906]  I kind of went through some hard times, like a car accident, toxic mold, poisoning, blah, blah, blah.
[02:53:45.146 --> 02:53:47.647]  And I started drinking a lot.
[02:53:48.527 --> 02:53:48.887]  And so,
[02:53:50.532 --> 02:54:02.381]  And I had like, you know, when I didn't drink, I had withdrawals, but I ordered some of your Brain Force Plus, and I took that with B12, and my withdrawal symptoms went away.
[02:54:03.702 --> 02:54:04.402]  It was incredible.
[02:54:06.264 --> 02:54:12.168]  So, I'm just saying, like, if anybody's going through a hard situation, give it a shot, man.
[02:54:12.849 --> 02:54:13.909]  It really does help.
[02:54:14.990 --> 02:54:19.113]  Also, I saw earlier that you had, you know, talking about the chemtrails?
[02:54:19.594 --> 02:54:19.774]  Yes.
[02:54:20.499 --> 02:54:27.305]  Um, there's been several situations where there was a day, um, I was looking up and there was chemtrails everywhere.
[02:54:28.105 --> 02:54:33.209]  And I saw the planes go by, but then there was several different planes that didn't have any chemtrails.
[02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:34.570]  Like, none at all.
[02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:47.561]  Well, that's the big tell-tale sign is, obviously there's real ice condensation trails, but then there's declassified government programs where it's added to jet fuel, barium salt, lime dioxide, to create nuclei
[02:54:49.178 --> 02:55:02.193]  Which then form an electrical charge and start condensating water so it creates basically sunscreen for the Earth and is causing a 30% dimming effect, NASA admits, for the planet.
[02:55:02.714 --> 02:55:06.318]  And then there's a bunch of other manipulation of the weather going on using...
[02:55:07.219 --> 02:55:14.724]  Doppler radar that's five to ten times stronger than it even needs to be, which they then use to ionize these particles even further.
[02:55:15.264 --> 02:55:17.545]  So this is silent weapons for quiet wars.
[02:55:17.906 --> 02:55:22.028]  It's part of a larger program and Mike Adams has written the article.
[02:55:22.368 --> 02:55:23.709]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:55:24.610 --> 02:55:25.570]  Everybody needs to get it.
[02:55:25.951 --> 02:55:27.331]  Terraforming has begun.
[02:55:27.732 --> 02:55:31.634]  Global dimming is a plot to exterminate humanity and the globalists own admissions.
[02:55:31.714 --> 02:55:32.515]  It sounds insane.
[02:55:33.075 --> 02:55:33.815]  It is insane.
[02:55:34.196 --> 02:55:36.137]  Go read it for yourself, but it's all admitted.
[02:55:37.455 --> 02:55:37.795]  Awesome.
[02:55:38.155 --> 02:55:39.516]  Well, is it okay if I do a plug?
[02:55:40.996 --> 02:55:41.617]  If you do a plug?
[02:55:42.477 --> 02:55:47.939]  Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, like, I'm an artist, and I've got, uh, it's brandonpervis.com.
[02:55:48.819 --> 02:55:49.720]  Great, what type of art is it?
[02:55:50.820 --> 02:55:52.021]  Oh, it's, oh, dude, everything.
[02:55:52.081 --> 02:56:02.205]  Sculpture, um, um, colors, uh, abstracts, uh, impressionism, uh, I've got characters, I got, like, crazy drawings, it's like, uh, alien-type stuff, it's everything.
[02:56:02.705 --> 02:56:05.306]  If you, uh, do, it's Brandon, B-R-A-N-N-O-N,
[02:56:05.856 --> 02:56:09.779]  P-U-R-V-I-S dot com, or you can just do Facebook, but it's all the same.
[02:56:09.799 --> 02:56:10.400]  I'll check it out.
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:11.040]  I'll check it out.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:19.848]  And since we're doing plugs here, specifically, you were taking Brain Force Plus, and then you're saying, did you take Secret 12 or somebody else's B12?
[02:56:20.829 --> 02:56:21.029]  Both.
[02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:22.350]  Both?
[02:56:23.691 --> 02:56:25.312]  Yeah, both at the same time.
[02:56:25.933 --> 02:56:29.456]  And dude, it's cured any withdrawal symptoms from alcohol.
[02:56:30.771 --> 02:56:34.114]  It's awesome, it's amazing, and it makes you, you know, I haven't even had any cravings.
[02:56:34.574 --> 02:56:35.895]  It's amazing.
[02:56:36.275 --> 02:56:43.661]  I've tried all kinds of stuff and that's... See, I have no trouble stopping drinking if I get ice cream and pie.
[02:56:44.302 --> 02:56:47.704]  I'm not a sweet tooth, but if I quit drinking, it's easy to quit drinking.
[02:56:47.725 --> 02:56:52.789]  I can just literally start eating ice cream at night and a piece of pie and then I get really fat.
[02:56:54.750 --> 02:56:57.532]  Yeah, some people who drink a lot obviously have really, really bad withdrawals.
[02:56:57.953 --> 02:57:06.560]  You know, I've never heard that angle on brain force getting people out of withdrawals, but I guess if the brain's dependent on the alcohol, then the brain forces a lot of things that stimulate the brain.
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:10.163]  That's my problem with alcohol, is it stimulates me.
[02:57:10.323 --> 02:57:12.345]  It doesn't make me tired.
[02:57:12.785 --> 02:57:13.446]  It's a stimulant.
[02:57:13.746 --> 02:57:18.871]  And I was never a big drinker until I started doing a lot of overnight radio interviews, and coffee wouldn't do it.
[02:57:20.121 --> 02:57:21.902]  But, six pack of beer would.
[02:57:22.362 --> 02:57:28.024]  So a lot of folks have a depressant effect with alcohol, and that doesn't happen with me, and that's not a good thing, they say.
[02:57:28.584 --> 02:57:39.608]  So that's why, I've gotten good though, I've cut back quite a bit on that, but it's obviously, humans have been fermenting things forever, but anything can be abused.
[02:57:40.088 --> 02:57:41.208]  But thank you for your testimonial.
[02:57:41.288 --> 02:57:44.809]  Alright, Dave, Grant, Danny, Tom, Jason, your calls.
[02:57:44.909 --> 02:57:46.170]  And then Matt Bracken.
[02:57:46.890 --> 02:57:49.371]  Matt Bracken's got a lot of key information to cover in the fourth hour.
[02:57:52.355 --> 02:57:58.834]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:58:00.529 --> 02:58:01.969]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:58:02.209 --> 02:58:07.150]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[02:58:08.310 --> 02:58:14.231]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:58:14.991 --> 02:58:26.733]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[02:58:26.793 --> 02:58:29.454]  And what I mean by that is, everyone will get a t-shirt, but
[02:58:30.334 --> 02:58:31.275]  These are going to be selling out.
[02:58:31.415 --> 02:58:36.459]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[02:58:36.779 --> 02:58:39.921]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order.
[02:58:40.001 --> 02:58:47.707]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have, beyond any other sale we've ever had, the free gift.
[02:58:48.208 --> 02:58:49.609]  So this is a loss leader.
[02:58:50.845 --> 02:58:57.167]  We are losing money on this, but we're gonna help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[02:58:57.607 --> 02:58:59.368]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[02:58:59.428 --> 02:59:04.369]  I love my state, but if you got a business and a company here and you got merchandise, BS.
[02:59:04.829 --> 02:59:05.309]  It's big.
[02:59:05.869 --> 02:59:06.270]  It's bad.
[02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:11.931]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[02:59:11.951 --> 02:59:14.252]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[02:59:14.692 --> 02:59:17.893]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[02:59:18.513 --> 02:59:19.454]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:59:19.494 --> 02:59:20.675]  That's been going on for over a month.
[02:59:21.456 --> 02:59:22.657]  50 to 75% off.
[02:59:22.677 --> 02:59:23.678]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[02:59:24.758 --> 02:59:25.699]  The Double Patriot points.
[02:59:25.719 --> 02:59:26.619]  That's what happened in about a week.
[02:59:26.979 --> 02:59:33.623]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[02:59:34.063 --> 02:59:38.445]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:38.485 --> 02:59:40.347]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:59:40.627 --> 02:59:42.428]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:59:42.628 --> 02:59:44.669]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:44.849 --> 02:59:48.871]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[02:59:56.681 --> 02:59:58.783]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:58.843 --> 03:00:00.185]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:29.508 --> 03:00:34.009]  All right, I'm hosting a couple more segments, and then Matt Bracken, who hosts The Fourth Hour, is going to be taking over here.
[03:00:34.029 --> 03:00:38.231]  He's got a lot to cover, obviously, about what's happening geopolitically, what's happening in Europe, and more.
[03:00:38.271 --> 03:00:46.914]  And I promise to hit that piece about Macron and the global carbon tax, tie it into Alexander Cortez, and I'll do that in the next segment.
[03:00:46.934 --> 03:00:49.634]  But let's get to your calls as quickly as possible now.
[03:00:49.654 --> 03:00:50.995]  I want to get to everybody that's been holding.
[03:00:51.875 --> 03:00:53.596]  Danny in Oklahoma, thanks for holding.
[03:00:53.616 --> 03:00:54.156]  You're on the air.
[03:00:54.216 --> 03:00:54.536]  Welcome.
[03:00:55.896 --> 03:00:56.817]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:00:57.037 --> 03:00:57.437]  Good, brother.
[03:00:58.211 --> 03:01:04.636]  Hey, I just want to say, you know, everybody's been talking about it, you know, George Bush this, George Bush that, got it all over the place.
[03:01:04.676 --> 03:01:10.940]  You know, I've been looking on my Facebook, and I even see my friends posting stuff about it, and I'm sitting here shaking my head, you know?
[03:01:11.681 --> 03:01:15.343]  And, you know, you got conservatives on there saying, well, you must be a Democrat.
[03:01:15.383 --> 03:01:22.108]  Well, I'm a Gulf War disabled vet, and I'm an independent, but I'm real conservative.
[03:01:22.168 --> 03:01:26.031]  And I'm just sitting here thinking to myself, does not anybody think for themselves anymore?
[03:01:26.949 --> 03:01:27.530]  I mean, really.
[03:01:27.870 --> 03:01:30.052]  Well, I think what you just said is the biggest thing ever.
[03:01:30.533 --> 03:01:32.975]  He lied about getting us into the war so we don't blame the vets.
[03:01:32.995 --> 03:01:34.036]  They did a great job.
[03:01:34.096 --> 03:01:35.838]  Then they blew up all the chemical dumps.
[03:01:36.379 --> 03:01:43.846]  It rained down, 25,000 detectors went off, and then he blocked any healthcare for people because he wanted to make the war look perfectly clean.
[03:01:44.246 --> 03:01:44.767]  That's what I mean.
[03:01:44.807 --> 03:01:48.571]  He's just a most selfish, psychopathic monster you could imagine.
[03:01:49.727 --> 03:01:51.088]  Yeah, and I'm lucky.
[03:01:51.128 --> 03:01:52.328]  You know, I'm one of the lucky ones.
[03:01:52.428 --> 03:01:56.429]  I did get my disability, but there's all kinds of people out there that don't have nothing.
[03:01:56.450 --> 03:02:00.791]  They're living on the streets and they're doing it, you know, and that brings me back to the second.
[03:02:01.231 --> 03:02:03.052]  Where's all the Republican Party at?
[03:02:03.712 --> 03:02:05.693]  You know, why aren't they out doing anything?
[03:02:05.733 --> 03:02:07.674]  You know, why aren't they investigating anybody?
[03:02:07.714 --> 03:02:09.294]  Why aren't they shutting down anything?
[03:02:09.374 --> 03:02:11.655]  Do we even have a Republican Party anymore?
[03:02:11.715 --> 03:02:13.456]  No, they're a bunch of blue blood cowards.
[03:02:14.465 --> 03:02:18.588]  Who all hate on Trump behind his back because he's trying to do something and that's why he has trouble getting stuff done.
[03:02:18.608 --> 03:02:19.809]  He's gotten a lot done despite it.
[03:02:20.269 --> 03:02:23.191]  It's because they're just a bunch of back-scratching cowards.
[03:02:23.672 --> 03:02:24.072]  D.C.
[03:02:24.152 --> 03:02:25.153]  is so sycophantic.
[03:02:25.173 --> 03:02:26.393]  You think Hollywood's sycophantic?
[03:02:26.734 --> 03:02:28.155]  How people grovel to Hollywood stars?
[03:02:29.576 --> 03:02:34.039]  They grovel to these House and Senate members.
[03:02:34.159 --> 03:02:34.819]  It is pathetic.
[03:02:34.859 --> 03:02:38.242]  And when I went and... Rubio came over to a press conference I was doing.
[03:02:40.129 --> 03:02:43.210]  They always cut the feed later.
[03:02:43.650 --> 03:02:48.372]  And then he started saying smart mouth stuff so I said it back to him and they said I disrupted his press conference.
[03:02:48.512 --> 03:02:49.532]  I was out there with the cameras.
[03:02:49.812 --> 03:02:51.473]  He came over like an idiot.
[03:02:52.273 --> 03:02:58.495]  And people later were just like Republicans were so upset Republican establishment was like you better get that Jones Mueller.
[03:02:58.955 --> 03:03:04.097]  And they got so pissed and you know tried to set me up because they literally worship their power.
[03:03:04.197 --> 03:03:07.498]  They worship themselves because they're all a bunch of nothings.
[03:03:08.098 --> 03:03:09.098]  They come from nothing.
[03:03:09.158 --> 03:03:09.998]  They've built nothing.
[03:03:10.379 --> 03:03:12.379]  All they do is get power and rob us.
[03:03:13.059 --> 03:03:13.959]  God, they make me sick.
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:15.060]  God bless you, Dan.
[03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:15.580]  Anything else?
[03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:18.400]  He's gone.
[03:03:18.961 --> 03:03:22.842]  OK, let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Pennsylvania.
[03:03:22.882 --> 03:03:23.122]  Go ahead.
[03:03:23.142 --> 03:03:25.122]  You're on the air.
[03:03:25.202 --> 03:03:25.642]  Hi, Alex.
[03:03:25.922 --> 03:03:26.262]  Hey, brother.
[03:03:26.362 --> 03:03:33.384]  This is kind of off topic from George Bush, but something that's been bothering me ever since the midterm elections.
[03:03:33.944 --> 03:03:35.364]  Do you think the Democrats cheated?
[03:03:35.485 --> 03:03:37.405]  I mean, I can't believe that they won back
[03:03:38.735 --> 03:03:39.977]  Oh, they cheated everywhere, sir.
[03:03:39.997 --> 03:03:40.759]  They admitted they cheated.
[03:03:40.819 --> 03:03:41.520]  It was total fraud.
[03:03:41.981 --> 03:03:43.865]  Illegals voting, by the names of dead people.
[03:03:44.707 --> 03:03:45.408]  It's incredible.
[03:03:46.811 --> 03:03:49.817]  How can this be stopped for the 2020 presidential election?
[03:03:51.258 --> 03:03:55.519]  Most of the Republicans are either cowards or they've left office.
[03:03:55.639 --> 03:04:02.901]  There's a good Freedom Caucus and they're great, and they're all being attacked and demonized and lied about like Jim Jordan and Scalise and others.
[03:04:03.801 --> 03:04:07.062]  So what we've got to do is just support more patriots to run, get more good ones in.
[03:04:07.842 --> 03:04:10.203]  People say, oh, well, you know, everything hasn't been fixed all the way.
[03:04:10.663 --> 03:04:17.947]  Because 40-something House members quit to try to hurt Trump, who are Republicans, but we're basically getting a lot of good Republicans who are patriots elected.
[03:04:17.967 --> 03:04:19.888]  So that's why the system's so scared right now.
[03:04:20.128 --> 03:04:25.151]  We've gotten two pretty good Supreme Court nominees, better than what Hillary would do, and we've gotten a lot of good things.
[03:04:25.191 --> 03:04:26.751]  That's why they're trying to break the economy right now.
[03:04:28.672 --> 03:04:29.393]  Yeah.
[03:04:29.493 --> 03:04:34.035]  On election night, I was just stunned to see how many votes the Democrats got.
[03:04:34.175 --> 03:04:38.197]  And I mean, my wife looked at us, we looked at each other and said, they had to have cheated.
[03:04:38.418 --> 03:04:39.138]  I mean, who would vote
[03:04:41.042 --> 03:04:48.408]  Well, Dave, here's the tell-tale sign.
[03:04:49.069 --> 03:04:50.430]  Well, exactly, but here's the key.
[03:04:51.471 --> 03:04:53.152]  They only won 20-something seats that night.
[03:04:53.252 --> 03:04:57.256]  Then they kept 20-something other races open and then stole them.
[03:04:57.636 --> 03:04:58.577]  Stuff in the ballot box.
[03:04:58.637 --> 03:04:59.097]  God bless you.
[03:04:59.117 --> 03:04:59.738]  Great points, Dave.
[03:05:00.118 --> 03:05:00.658]  Stay with us, folks.
[03:05:00.678 --> 03:05:01.119]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:04.205 --> 03:05:04.686]  Look at that.
[03:05:04.706 --> 03:05:07.411]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[03:05:07.431 --> 03:05:08.834]  That's because it's been denatured.
[03:05:08.854 --> 03:05:09.696]  It's been watered down.
[03:05:09.716 --> 03:05:10.798]  We didn't do that.
[03:05:12.381 --> 03:05:18.645]  If you think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get, I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:05:19.226 --> 03:05:27.772]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:05:28.252 --> 03:05:29.933]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:05:29.973 --> 03:05:31.094]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:05:31.795 --> 03:05:34.296]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:05:34.336 --> 03:05:35.437]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:05:36.198 --> 03:05:39.120]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:05:46.696 --> 03:05:47.036]  Look it up!
[03:05:48.156 --> 03:05:54.158]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:05:54.198 --> 03:05:59.040]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:02.241]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4Store.com.
[03:06:15.406 --> 03:06:18.715]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:19.477 --> 03:06:21.322]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:26.531]  Alright, I'm getting out of here in about 10 minutes, so Matt Bracken can host the rest of the hour.
[03:06:26.691 --> 03:06:28.712]  There's Matt Bracken right there, if you're a TV viewer.
[03:06:29.292 --> 03:06:32.033]  And we're syndicated on radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[03:06:32.533 --> 03:06:35.294]  Great folks that understand that we're being lied about and it's a bunch of propaganda.
[03:06:35.314 --> 03:06:40.516]  And we're just loyal Americans promoting classic Americana in the face of these globalist demons.
[03:06:41.436 --> 03:06:44.277]  Let's finish up with a few of your calls, and Matt's going to take over.
[03:06:44.957 --> 03:06:47.098]  I've got one point to make, obviously, about McCrind.
[03:06:47.758 --> 03:06:50.099]  But let's go to... who's up next here?
[03:06:51.516 --> 03:06:55.438]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Canada, then Grant and Jason.
[03:06:55.858 --> 03:06:57.038]  Tom, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:06:58.199 --> 03:06:59.480]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:07:00.080 --> 03:07:00.440]  Thank you.
[03:07:00.460 --> 03:07:12.425]  Yeah, as far as George Bush, if you want like a Canadian perspective on it, well my perspective anyway, it's like I can't believe they just milk all the evil out of these people even after they're dead.
[03:07:13.366 --> 03:07:14.166]  It just never ends.
[03:07:16.718 --> 03:07:17.459]  That's a good way to say it.
[03:07:17.479 --> 03:07:18.780]  They smoke the evil out of him.
[03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:22.823]  They just keep worshipping him and praising him and fawning at him for six days.
[03:07:22.863 --> 03:07:30.569]  And then he comes down to Texas and they wheel him along with American flags, festooning his fancy train hearse.
[03:07:31.289 --> 03:07:33.071]  And he wanted to get rid of America.
[03:07:33.551 --> 03:07:35.713]  His whole ideology was get rid of the nation state.
[03:07:36.513 --> 03:07:39.596]  But their world government was bigger than just one small country.
[03:07:41.858 --> 03:07:43.939]  Yeah, it never seems to end.
[03:07:45.979 --> 03:07:52.924]  On behalf of Canada, I'd like to apologize that we have Zoolander for Prime Minister up here, but it happened.
[03:07:53.924 --> 03:08:00.448]  And then we had his dad in the 70s give away our banking system, so I guess he's coming here to finish us off, unfortunately.
[03:08:01.189 --> 03:08:02.670]  But don't give up on Canada yet.
[03:08:02.970 --> 03:08:06.652]  We still have a paper election when we do it federally here.
[03:08:07.693 --> 03:08:12.236]  Trudeau will be out the next time, but hopefully, I don't know what's going on with the other two parties.
[03:08:12.276 --> 03:08:15.258]  I know our NDP, they're just as bad as the Liberals.
[03:08:16.181 --> 03:08:24.946]  And our conservative party, hopefully they haven't turned on us, so we're hoping when they get in the next election that they're not another globalist party.
[03:08:25.826 --> 03:08:27.007]  Tom, God bless you.
[03:08:27.187 --> 03:08:33.130]  Once people are awake, it's going to be really hard to keep their global program going, but evil always comes back in another guise.
[03:08:33.811 --> 03:08:41.815]  But since you mentioned Trudeau, Macron is this horrible globalist with a 20-25% approval rating.
[03:08:43.931 --> 03:08:48.673]  And now he's had to first say, okay, we'll do a six-month moratorium on the giant global carbon tax.
[03:08:48.733 --> 03:08:49.734]  It's a global government tax.
[03:08:51.034 --> 03:08:52.675]  They said, well, now it's indefinite.
[03:08:54.376 --> 03:08:58.438]  Macron submits to Yellow Vest rebellion, cancels fuel tax hike indefinitely.
[03:08:59.619 --> 03:09:06.442]  Police arrest leader of Dutch Yellow Vest, ahead of nationwide protest against political correctness.
[03:09:07.502 --> 03:09:08.363]  So now they're having to
[03:09:11.661 --> 03:09:18.322]  Arrest the opposition as the Yellow Vest Movement spreads, which is what I predicted, it's what Matt Bracken's predicted.
[03:09:19.783 --> 03:09:23.203]  Europe is either going to rebel against this and stop this or it's going to cease to exist.
[03:09:23.344 --> 03:09:27.644]  Even the French Interior Minister a month ago said, we're under total Islamic invasion.
[03:09:28.025 --> 03:09:29.025]  That's the EU plan.
[03:09:29.085 --> 03:09:30.625]  We either reverse this or we're done.
[03:09:30.645 --> 03:09:34.346]  I'm going to finish up with Jason and Grant, but since I mentioned this, here is
[03:09:36.181 --> 03:09:48.406]  Alexandra Cortez says, inevitable global warming governance, that's global warming government over the planet, will create economic, social and racial justice.
[03:09:49.387 --> 03:09:51.587]  And there's video with her with Bernie Sanders.
[03:09:52.628 --> 03:09:56.109]  None of these people actually care about the general public.
[03:09:56.149 --> 03:09:57.090]  They care about control.
[03:09:57.430 --> 03:10:04.413]  Bernie Sanders spends $300,000 a month on big private jets he flies around while lecturing blue collar people how they should pay a carbon tax.
[03:10:06.035 --> 03:10:08.436]  The total global elite are for the carbon tax.
[03:10:09.077 --> 03:10:10.738]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, you name it.
[03:10:11.078 --> 03:10:17.322]  But they sell it to the socialists and to the millennials like it's the mother's milk.
[03:10:17.742 --> 03:10:19.263]  It's free mammon from heaven.
[03:10:19.803 --> 03:10:24.746]  So here is, creepy eyes, Alexander Cortez.
[03:10:25.353 --> 03:10:26.874]  First of all, it's just plain wrong.
[03:10:27.374 --> 03:10:42.319]  The idea that we're going to somehow lose economic activity, as a matter of fact, it's not just possible that we will create jobs and economic activity by transitioning to renewable energy, but it's inevitable.
[03:10:42.739 --> 03:10:43.439]  No, that is not your proposal.
[03:11:08.050 --> 03:11:13.992]  Under your global governance model, carbon dioxide, one of the four bases of life on the planet, is taxed as bad.
[03:11:14.412 --> 03:11:24.135]  There is no energy that doesn't have carbon somehow associated with it and allows you to selectively tax and control everything for a global government that tracks it all, like you said.
[03:11:25.415 --> 03:11:27.096]  So she acts like she's innovating.
[03:11:27.912 --> 03:11:31.436]  When socialists and communists do one thing, they ruin countries.
[03:11:32.017 --> 03:11:39.706]  And cities they control turn into piles of manure, needles, homeless people, and women like her wearing $5,000 designer outfits.
[03:11:41.954 --> 03:11:43.856]  Flying around on private jets at limousine liberals.
[03:11:43.936 --> 03:11:45.477]  Truly sickening.
[03:11:45.517 --> 03:11:48.779]  But the good news is the world is awake to her garbage.
[03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:51.862]  And they're awake to the carbon tax and what a scam it is.
[03:11:52.202 --> 03:11:56.045]  And how China and India and Mexico and 160 other countries don't have to do it.
[03:11:56.585 --> 03:12:00.388]  But Italy and France and Germany and the US and Canada and Australia.
[03:12:00.729 --> 03:12:03.391]  We all have to do it and then literally pay money.
[03:12:04.861 --> 03:12:08.024]  To the Rothschilds that own the biggest carbon group in England?
[03:12:08.544 --> 03:12:11.987]  And then to Al Gore and Rahm Emanuel?
[03:12:14.109 --> 03:12:14.929]  In Chicago?
[03:12:16.030 --> 03:12:19.973]  Literally, you're going to pay Obama money when you gas up your car.
[03:12:20.334 --> 03:12:21.334]  Unbelievable.
[03:12:21.675 --> 03:12:23.977]  Jason in Colorado, you're on the air.
[03:12:23.997 --> 03:12:24.557]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:24.577 --> 03:12:24.937]  Go ahead.
[03:12:26.619 --> 03:12:27.179]  Hey there, Alex.
[03:12:27.199 --> 03:12:27.680]  How you doing?
[03:12:29.744 --> 03:12:37.045]  Colorado Springs is big troop supporters out here, and I can't believe all the troops that are out here that support Bush.
[03:12:37.586 --> 03:12:40.786]  It's like, you know, everybody has memory loss here.
[03:12:40.806 --> 03:12:45.347]  I do have to say one thing on the topic of George Bush, but first I want to say two things.
[03:12:45.407 --> 03:12:48.568]  I've been listening to you for 20 years, and I commend you.
[03:12:48.588 --> 03:12:50.468]  I listen to you every day.
[03:12:50.948 --> 03:12:54.809]  You fight every day for this truth, and you're on the line every day.
[03:12:55.870 --> 03:13:01.291]  And you're so humble, and you are an example to all of us out there, and I hope more men like you rise up.
[03:13:02.231 --> 03:13:03.432]  I had cancer back in 2011.
[03:13:04.192 --> 03:13:08.533]  I used so many of your products, the doctors could not believe how fast I recovered.
[03:13:08.973 --> 03:13:23.916]  I've bought your t-shirts, your hats, your stickers, the toothpaste, the parasite cleanse, the carnivore, the Alexa Pure Pro Filter, the Super Silver Secret 12 Happy, Survival Shield, Mico ZX, and I'm telling you, people just order these products.
[03:13:23.956 --> 03:13:25.056]  They'll change your life.
[03:13:26.268 --> 03:13:31.090]  I just ordered some more toothpaste, the Super Silver Wound Dressing, and I can't wait to get my free t-shirt.
[03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:35.191]  But back on the Bush Point, they're in an echo chamber.
[03:13:35.671 --> 03:13:37.091]  The Dems are praising Bush.
[03:13:37.131 --> 03:13:41.252]  It shows they're in bed together with them, and they're just defeating their own narrative.
[03:13:41.292 --> 03:13:48.835]  They're showing everybody that they're all buddies, and people are awake to it, and they are watching, and they are saying, that's it.
[03:13:48.915 --> 03:13:50.635]  We're done with both of these systems.
[03:13:51.735 --> 03:13:52.736]  And that's my point, Alex.
[03:13:52.776 --> 03:13:53.856]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[03:13:57.469 --> 03:14:02.412]  Well, you made some really central points, and of course the joke is the only good Republican is a dead Republican.
[03:14:02.852 --> 03:14:06.014]  As soon as a Republican dies, well then they're suddenly wonderful, the Democrats.
[03:14:06.054 --> 03:14:16.319]  But in the case of McCain and George W. Bush, they love them because they were total globalists who helped control the Republican Party in really a one-party dictatorship posing as two.
[03:14:16.359 --> 03:14:18.501]  With Trump, we have a nationalist move.
[03:14:19.221 --> 03:14:19.882]  We're good.
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:37.982]  Grant, thank you so much for your support, and I'm glad to hear the products helped you.
[03:14:38.523 --> 03:14:42.865]  There's a lot of evidence behind stuff like the iodine and the DNA force.
[03:14:43.165 --> 03:14:43.926]  So thank you so much.
[03:14:43.966 --> 03:14:44.386]  God bless.
[03:14:44.746 --> 03:14:45.427]  Okay, Grant.
[03:14:45.967 --> 03:14:46.808]  No, that was Jason.
[03:14:46.828 --> 03:14:47.468]  I apologize.
[03:14:47.508 --> 03:14:48.669]  I'm moving quick to get the last callers.
[03:14:48.889 --> 03:14:49.469]  That was Jason.
[03:14:49.489 --> 03:14:50.049]  Thank you, Jason.
[03:14:50.450 --> 03:14:51.530]  Grant's our last caller.
[03:14:51.730 --> 03:14:52.491]  I got to everybody today.
[03:14:52.511 --> 03:14:53.111]  I'm proud of myself.
[03:14:53.131 --> 03:14:53.632]  First time ever.
[03:14:53.912 --> 03:14:55.873]  Grant, real fast in Iowa, then Matt Bracken.
[03:14:55.913 --> 03:14:56.193]  Go ahead.
[03:14:57.294 --> 03:14:58.214]  Fast as I can do it.
[03:14:58.855 --> 03:15:02.377]  Just commenting on what you guys were talking about earlier about the money supply and
[03:15:03.417 --> 03:15:04.018]  I think so.
[03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:35.246]  And they even teach you in these basic macro classes that they can screw up by implementing a policy too late, and it can actually have the opposite unwanted effect.
[03:15:35.306 --> 03:15:46.794]  They literally teach you that, and then they're like, oh yeah, but you know, just keep in mind that they always have our best interests at heart, and everything's fine, don't worry, the Fed loves you, and oh wait, it's Federal Express, it's no more Federal than Federal Express.
[03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:52.003]  Everything about it's a fraud, and then they deliberately are doing this to hurt nation-states.
[03:15:52.483 --> 03:15:54.224]  They're doing it to stop nation-states.
[03:15:54.344 --> 03:15:54.904]  It's incredible.
[03:15:54.944 --> 03:15:55.685]  Thank you, Grant.
[03:15:56.265 --> 03:16:00.908]  All right, coming up, Matt Bracken, enemiesforeignanddomestic.com, counterterrorism specialist.
[03:16:02.771 --> 03:16:10.836]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[03:16:11.137 --> 03:16:22.264]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[03:16:22.544 --> 03:16:30.370]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[03:16:33.651 --> 03:16:40.074]  Up to 75% off on top sellers, including free shipping, double patriot points, and unprecedented daily specials.
[03:16:40.414 --> 03:16:47.437]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the new world order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty and trying to shut down the free press is.
[03:16:47.837 --> 03:16:55.881]  And that's why when you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, you don't just give yourself the gift of high quality supplements or storable foods or incredible water filtration.
[03:16:56.221 --> 03:17:01.785]  No, you give yourself the gift of funding the First Amendment in a desperate attempt to save this country.
[03:17:02.325 --> 03:17:07.389]  Even though InfoWars has delivered the fight against tyranny like no other, we're not just asking for your support.
[03:17:07.769 --> 03:17:11.731]  We're asking you to have a 360 win because this is the biggest sale of the year.
[03:17:11.952 --> 03:17:24.220]  We're extending storewide free shipping up to 75% off of best-selling items, double Patriot points, and for the 12 days of Christmas leading up to Christmas, every day we have one particular special that is up to 75% off.
[03:17:26.401 --> 03:17:34.286]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your support to continue to promote the spirit of liberty and Americana that truly is the Christmas spirit.
[03:17:34.626 --> 03:17:38.908]  When you shop at InfoWarsStore.com, you don't just get incredible sales during the 12 days of Christmas.
[03:17:39.289 --> 03:17:41.950]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[03:17:42.390 --> 03:17:50.955]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfoWarsStore.com is the last run, 55% off, of Super Male and Super Female Lethality.
[03:17:51.035 --> 03:17:54.998]  It's hard to procure it anymore, so we're discontinuing it even though it's the best seller at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:55.618 --> 03:17:59.062]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWar possible.
[03:17:59.422 --> 03:18:01.384]  Again, you are the resistance.
[03:18:02.044 --> 03:18:08.491]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:18:10.202 --> 03:18:11.642]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:18:11.882 --> 03:18:16.823]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[03:18:17.984 --> 03:18:23.905]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:18:24.665 --> 03:18:32.327]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[03:18:33.107 --> 03:18:59.259]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[03:19:00.521 --> 03:19:06.843]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[03:19:07.283 --> 03:19:09.023]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[03:19:09.104 --> 03:19:14.025]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[03:19:14.485 --> 03:19:14.965]  It's big.
[03:19:15.525 --> 03:19:15.946]  It's bad.
[03:19:16.386 --> 03:19:21.607]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[03:19:21.627 --> 03:19:23.928]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[03:19:24.348 --> 03:19:27.549]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[03:19:28.169 --> 03:19:29.132]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:19:29.152 --> 03:19:30.336]  That's been going on for over a month.
[03:19:31.098 --> 03:19:32.322]  50 to 75% off.
[03:19:32.362 --> 03:19:33.365]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[03:19:34.414 --> 03:19:35.354]  The Double Patriot points.
[03:19:35.394 --> 03:19:36.295]  That's what happened in about a week.
[03:19:36.655 --> 03:19:43.277]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[03:19:43.737 --> 03:19:48.119]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:48.139 --> 03:19:50.020]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:19:50.280 --> 03:19:52.100]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:54.341]  And don't fight the crowds at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:54.501 --> 03:19:58.523]  And from myself and the Infowars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:20:06.292 --> 03:20:10.434]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.898 --> 03:20:30.180]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:30.741 --> 03:20:34.122]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:20:37.133 --> 03:20:49.297]  Hey, Matt Bracken here for the rest of the hour, and I'm going to start off just saying something nice about George Herbert Walker Bush before I get to the main point about what I think about the entire state funeral.
[03:20:50.338 --> 03:21:02.362]  I've got to be fair and admit that back in 1980, in the military, when Carter went out and Reagan Bush came in, it was like switching the lights on in a, you know, a dead house.
[03:21:03.959 --> 03:21:10.744]  In SEAL Team, you wouldn't believe, you would actually be shocked or embarrassed by how pathetic the equipment we had was.
[03:21:11.284 --> 03:21:16.728]  Coming out of the 70s, we were using busted-up, old, worn-out 1960s gear.
[03:21:17.468 --> 03:21:18.549]  Ingram MAC-10s.
[03:21:18.589 --> 03:21:23.172]  We had 38 revolvers that Humphrey Bogart might have used.
[03:21:24.433 --> 03:21:27.375]  Old, worn-out Smith & Wesson Model 39s.
[03:21:28.215 --> 03:21:29.556]  Our boats were disgraceful.
[03:21:29.696 --> 03:21:30.477]  They were a joke.
[03:21:31.198 --> 03:21:43.911]  And Bush, being a speedboat guy himself, you know, as a hobby, he saw some demonstrations of our gear, and I'll tell you what, for SEAL Team, the equipment ramped up like you wouldn't believe.
[03:21:44.051 --> 03:21:48.615]  So, at least for Special Warfare, that was really like the dawn of a new era.
[03:21:48.635 --> 03:21:50.257]  1980-81, that's when SEAL Team 6 came online.
[03:21:53.786 --> 03:22:03.270]  Really, we went from worn-out Korean War crap, you wouldn't believe, Vietnam era, Korean War era stuff, to state-of-the-art, what we needed.
[03:22:03.770 --> 03:22:05.871]  So I will give the devil his due there.
[03:22:06.472 --> 03:22:20.218]  Now, watching the week-long state funeral, or like Kremlin funeral, as some have referred to it, it reminds me that when an empire is in collapse,
[03:22:20.905 --> 03:22:25.847]  That's when the Palace Guard is at its most extravagant.
[03:22:25.907 --> 03:22:33.209]  That's when the hats and uniforms get the fanciest, as it's in decline at the fringes of the Empire.
[03:22:33.789 --> 03:22:36.850]  It just seems to go with the cycles of history.
[03:22:37.690 --> 03:22:42.212]  And the way that I look at it, I think that he was a great family man, for sure.
[03:22:42.232 --> 03:22:48.514]  I admire his family overall, the way that they love one another.
[03:22:48.594 --> 03:22:49.874]  There's a lot to admire.
[03:22:50.902 --> 03:23:09.613]  But I heard on CNN, I think this was when the casket was being brought into the Capitol building, one CNN anchor very warmly and approvingly said to another that this type of a function was our United States secular religion.
[03:23:10.593 --> 03:23:13.355]  Read that as like an atheist or our state religion.
[03:23:14.075 --> 03:23:18.718]  So we can't have the pomp and circumstance, you know, under the cross necessarily.
[03:23:19.358 --> 03:23:20.559]  So we'll put it in the Capitol.
[03:23:21.365 --> 03:23:24.847]  With a flag and military honor guards every step of the way.
[03:23:24.867 --> 03:23:28.770]  And it's virtually our state religion.
[03:23:29.491 --> 03:23:49.044]  And I think that the greater message here, it's been said all week that this is being ramped up in order to compare it to Trump and what a brutal, crude, vulgarian he is compared to the much more smooth and sophisticated Bush family.
[03:23:49.841 --> 03:23:59.470]  I think that this is the way that they signal to current politicians, this is how the deep state will reward you if you're on our team.
[03:24:00.371 --> 03:24:06.597]  If you are a populist and you resist the deep state, you're going to get nothing.
[03:24:07.278 --> 03:24:11.822]  You're going to get the scraps decades later when you pass away.
[03:24:12.563 --> 03:24:17.567]  But if you are a team player for the Deep State, you're going to get all the bells and whistles.
[03:24:17.607 --> 03:24:20.810]  You're going to have honor guards, you know, step by step.
[03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:23.852]  Air Force One trains, you name it.
[03:24:24.193 --> 03:24:26.034]  Nothing will be out of reach.
[03:24:26.494 --> 03:24:35.802]  So this is a signal to current politicians to, you know, stay on board the Deep State team in order to get the big reward down the road.
[03:24:36.523 --> 03:24:40.386]  And now I'm old enough to remember the first Gulf War.
[03:24:41.289 --> 03:24:46.114]  And it's little known and maybe some of you younger guys can dig into the history a little bit.
[03:24:46.935 --> 03:24:56.125]  But at the time, starting in 88, we had a female ambassador in Iraq named April Gillespie.
[03:24:56.906 --> 03:25:03.713]  And it's controversial to this day that she either misread cues or the wrong signals were given.
[03:25:04.679 --> 03:25:15.064]  But there were meetings between her and Saddam Hussein and his foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, who was a Christian, by the way.
[03:25:16.105 --> 03:25:19.926]  It was a pretty secular state for the Middle East under Saddam Hussein.
[03:25:21.641 --> 03:25:39.517]  That the Kuwait had been abusing the vague borders between Kuwait and Iraq and had been slant drilling into rich oil fields in southern Iraq, basically stealing oil from Iraq, greatly angering, naturally, Saddam Hussein.
[03:25:39.538 --> 03:25:45.383]  And when they were discussing this, and Saddam Hussein had been moving troops to the south,
[03:25:46.252 --> 03:25:53.495]  That apparently April Glaspie did not, you know, firmly say, look, if you move any tanks into Kuwait, we're going to go at you full force.
[03:25:54.215 --> 03:25:57.917]  And there might have been poor translations or misread communications.
[03:25:58.577 --> 03:26:14.064]  But a lot of people think that Saddam Hussein took it as a signal that the United States wouldn't go to the mat if Iraq settled their differences with Kuwait over this disputed oil in the north of Kuwait and the south of Iraq.
[03:26:15.483 --> 03:26:19.321]  Now, on our side, we say, well, we never meant that they should take the whole country.
[03:26:20.140 --> 03:26:27.886]  But it seems that under George Bush, there was at least some kind of a miscommunication which led to the entire situation.
[03:26:28.246 --> 03:26:30.267]  Certainly, that wasn't the firm message given.
[03:26:30.848 --> 03:26:47.740]  Some conspiracy theory-minded people would say that he was sort of like, you know, I wouldn't say lured or baited or tricked, but he certainly was given the impression, many think that he was given the impression, that the United States wouldn't mind if Iraq chewed off part of Kuwait.
[03:26:48.100 --> 03:26:49.601]  And he ended up taking the whole country
[03:26:50.279 --> 03:26:52.540]  Desert Shield and Desert Storm was the result.
[03:26:53.821 --> 03:27:03.207]  That was the first big shock and awe and the Norman Schwarzkopf and the entire deal we saw.
[03:27:03.847 --> 03:27:12.252]  But that led to Saddam Hussein eventually being invaded under his son 15 or so years later.
[03:27:12.933 --> 03:27:14.093]  But yeah, there's a lot of history.
[03:27:14.133 --> 03:27:14.934]  It goes way back.
[03:27:15.805 --> 03:27:27.450]  George Bush was no doubt a heroic pilot in World War II, even though to get to become a pilot without going to college at age 19, I'm sure it didn't hurt that his father was a senator.
[03:27:28.231 --> 03:27:30.132]  Now, that's no discredit to him.
[03:27:30.152 --> 03:27:31.472]  I mean, he was shot down.
[03:27:31.532 --> 03:27:32.853]  He was rescued.
[03:27:32.873 --> 03:27:33.813]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:27:35.666 --> 03:27:36.146]  I think so.
[03:27:54.330 --> 03:28:00.714]  And he was a deep state player from go after that ambassador to China, director of the CIA.
[03:28:00.734 --> 03:28:04.797]  You know, and then vice president and president.
[03:28:05.298 --> 03:28:07.399]  He lived through some very tumultuous times.
[03:28:07.499 --> 03:28:13.363]  And I wouldn't go so far as to call him an evil guy who knows what dealings the Bush family had all along.
[03:28:13.403 --> 03:28:16.145]  But there's no question he was a New World Order guy.
[03:28:16.165 --> 03:28:19.927]  But you have to think in terms of globalism.
[03:28:19.967 --> 03:28:22.169]  Now, globalists
[03:28:22.833 --> 03:28:26.316]  They won't wear on their sleeve, I'm for a one world government.
[03:28:26.876 --> 03:28:33.481]  They'll speak in code like New World Order, but they'll wrap themselves in the flag, they'll wear the flag on their lapel.
[03:28:34.081 --> 03:28:43.228]  But when they're talking about New World Order, they're talking about superseding national sovereignty and moving into a global order.
[03:28:43.308 --> 03:28:46.990]  And that's what we'll cover in the next section when we come back from the break.
[03:28:47.851 --> 03:28:51.614]  I'm Matt Frackin, sitting in for the rest of the hour, and we'll be back soon.
[03:29:05.737 --> 03:29:23.765]  If we look at how Brighton is as an area, it's got an extremely high LGBT population, it's extremely liberal, so when kids are in a school and they feel, oh, there's no stigma attached to being gender fluid or trans, so if they feel supported in an environment, then they're going to be questioned.
[03:29:23.785 --> 03:29:25.006]  Why should they be encouraged
[03:29:25.086 --> 03:29:26.507]  Well, who says that they woke up one day?
[03:29:26.527 --> 03:29:28.729]  Who says that it's not something that happens overnight?
[03:29:41.958 --> 03:29:43.659]  Identifying as male and female?
[03:29:43.679 --> 03:29:44.920]  Well maybe, maybe.
[03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:45.220]  Really?
[03:29:45.440 --> 03:29:46.401]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:29:46.521 --> 03:29:47.601]  Why would you be happy with that?
[03:29:47.621 --> 03:29:52.464]  Not nobody, but some, you know, some people are trans and that's, that's the fact.
[03:29:52.544 --> 03:29:56.686]  Do you genuinely think 76 kids in one school are transgender?
[03:29:56.787 --> 03:29:57.747]  I'm saying that it's a possibility.
[03:29:57.807 --> 03:29:58.487]  Or do you think it's possible?
[03:29:58.568 --> 03:29:59.248]  Is it possible?
[03:29:59.408 --> 03:30:00.429]  I say it's a possibility.
[03:30:00.449 --> 03:30:01.009]  They've all just...
[03:30:01.289 --> 03:30:11.673]  Let's now go back to Faith Goldie, who is a woman.
[03:30:11.693 --> 03:30:12.774]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[03:30:12.974 --> 03:30:14.134]  Faith Goldie is a woman.
[03:30:14.254 --> 03:30:15.075]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:15.175 --> 03:30:15.755]  I am a man.
[03:30:15.795 --> 03:30:16.535]  You can see the difference.
[03:30:16.595 --> 03:30:17.035]  I'm ugly.
[03:30:17.055 --> 03:30:17.476]  She's pretty.
[03:30:17.916 --> 03:30:18.636]  She can have babies.
[03:30:18.716 --> 03:30:19.076]  I can't.
[03:30:19.256 --> 03:30:21.417]  I can gouge people's eyeballs out pretty easily.
[03:30:21.497 --> 03:30:23.458]  She might not be able to do it as easy, but she's pretty tough.
[03:30:23.558 --> 03:30:24.979]  Faith, thanks for coming on with us today.
[03:30:25.019 --> 03:30:25.779]  It's great to see you.
[03:30:25.899 --> 03:30:27.200]  Thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[03:30:27.460 --> 03:30:40.570]  As for the grooming of these young autistic children, that's what we're seeing across the UK and other jurisdictions, this is just the next evolution of what the Gay-Straight Alliance groups across North America, that they were putting into our school institutions.
[03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:42.712]  This is just Generation 2.
[03:30:42.812 --> 03:30:53.480]  They were basically breeding grounds to normalize deviant behavior, and then also not just normalize it, but also to sort of make it a trend, and that's indeed what we're seeing here.
[03:30:53.780 --> 03:30:55.481]  They're preying on autistic children.
[03:30:55.781 --> 03:31:07.866]  This is what some of the most tyrannical regimes have done in even recent history, and that's to use the slow, the autistic, to help bolster, frankly, their statistics.
[03:31:07.927 --> 03:31:17.511]  And that's what this LGBTP movement is doing, is that they're preying on autistic children to bolster their statistics.
[03:31:17.851 --> 03:31:19.031]  This is beyond sick.
[03:31:19.051 --> 03:31:20.712]  This is, this is reprehensible.
[03:31:20.732 --> 03:31:23.272]  This is evil and it should be condemned in every single way.
[03:31:23.652 --> 03:31:27.333]  We were joking around a little, talking a little bit about sports during the, um, during the break.
[03:31:27.353 --> 03:31:28.413]  So I just want to say this.
[03:31:28.973 --> 03:31:31.614]  Men, turn off your TVs on Sundays.
[03:31:31.974 --> 03:31:36.175]  As video games are to young men, sports games are to older men.
[03:31:36.495 --> 03:31:40.216]  It is normal and natural for you to have loyalty, to have patriotism, to want to
[03:31:40.316 --> 03:31:41.337]  Fight for your country.
[03:31:41.617 --> 03:31:44.399]  To want to have your team be victorious.
[03:31:44.779 --> 03:31:47.221]  But it's not on the 50-yard line.
[03:31:47.341 --> 03:31:49.183]  It's on your border lines right now.
[03:31:49.323 --> 03:31:50.504]  That's where we are called.
[03:31:50.824 --> 03:31:56.889]  Your colors are not some city that is far away from you that you might not even have any historical connection to.
[03:31:57.269 --> 03:32:01.492]  The colors that you should be bleeding are the ones on your national flag.
[03:32:01.872 --> 03:32:06.476]  And so I pray, folks, just turn off all of the sports balls.
[03:32:06.956 --> 03:32:08.516]  It's cucked nationalism.
[03:32:08.897 --> 03:32:14.298]  It's feeding natural appetites in a very unnatural and frankly unproductive way.
[03:32:14.438 --> 03:32:17.658]  So even if you know that they're fighting for your country, go fight for your family.
[03:32:17.938 --> 03:32:20.259]  Turn off your TV on Sundays.
[03:32:20.279 --> 03:32:22.179]  There's a bunch of guys taking a knee anyway.
[03:32:22.519 --> 03:32:28.281]  And go spend some time with Junior or spend some time with, you know, your local community center, whatever it is.
[03:32:28.681 --> 03:32:34.842]  And why don't you go have a rally against this UN migrant compact that we're going to be signing any day now down in Morocco.
[03:32:35.382 --> 03:32:44.050]  Look, if you look at all the top EU leaders right now, they've got all sorts of degeneracies, but one thing that they don't have are kids, and that's why they don't give a damn about the future of our nation.
[03:32:44.190 --> 03:32:54.319]  Unlike President God Emperor Donald Trump, it might be from a couple different ladies, but he's got lots of kids, and he sure as heck gives a damn about the future of not just that nation, but also all of the global order.
[03:32:54.339 --> 03:32:56.781]  So God bless him, and God bless America, and God bless you, Alex.
[03:32:56.861 --> 03:32:58.263]  I'm so happy I was back on your show today.
[03:32:58.323 --> 03:32:59.103]  You are awesome.
[03:32:59.123 --> 03:32:59.464]  Amazing.
[03:33:05.828 --> 03:33:12.054]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.366 --> 03:33:28.268]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:28.728 --> 03:33:32.612]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:36.869 --> 03:33:37.610]  Okay, we're back.
[03:33:40.351 --> 03:33:50.038]  So we're now at the end of 2018, and we're seeing the deep state coup against President Trump maybe reaching its endgame.
[03:33:50.878 --> 03:34:00.565]  And I kind of compare this to a high stakes poker game where each of the two remaining players has a few final cards hidden away up their sleeves.
[03:34:01.420 --> 03:34:10.204]  And it's really a question now in this final session of bluffing and bidding, who's going to put their hand down last?
[03:34:11.165 --> 03:34:18.268]  Mueller is hinting broadly about the, you know, there's all the rumors that the Mueller report will be coming out any day, any week.
[03:34:19.669 --> 03:34:23.751]  And then Trump has the cards that he can play of declassification.
[03:34:24.562 --> 03:34:38.213]  Can he release the transcripts of some email strings that are going to prove that Comey and Rosenstein and McCabe, they all knew that the FISA application was a steaming pile all along.
[03:34:39.514 --> 03:34:44.458]  Will the deep staters still around Trump allow him to declassify?
[03:34:44.498 --> 03:34:47.040]  Will they pressure him into not declassifying?
[03:34:47.060 --> 03:34:50.142]  Of course, he can at any time order it, just give the order.
[03:34:51.730 --> 03:35:04.873]  Then we're going to now be in the last couple weeks of the Republican-controlled Congress with the heroes like Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, these guys in charge.
[03:35:05.093 --> 03:35:07.154]  And in January, it flips to Adam Schiff.
[03:35:08.254 --> 03:35:15.476]  So what are the odds that Comey will actually be convinced to testify in front of a hostile Congress?
[03:35:16.156 --> 03:35:16.816]  It's pretty low.
[03:35:17.682 --> 03:35:28.891]  But then, come next January, it's going to be the Democrats in charge of the committees in Congress, but the Republicans will have an even stronger majority in the Senate.
[03:35:29.251 --> 03:35:38.238]  That might result in kind of a Mexican standoff, with both sides afraid to go too far with their investigations.
[03:35:39.018 --> 03:35:46.404]  Of course, this also means there's going to be absolutely no legislation moved forward, including money for the wall.
[03:35:47.972 --> 03:35:49.353]  That right now they're bargaining.
[03:35:49.373 --> 03:35:52.514]  The wall, I think, would cost like at least $20 billion, a real wall.
[03:35:53.314 --> 03:36:01.998]  And they're bargaining over whether it'll be $1.6 that the Democrats are willing to give or $5 that Trump wants right away.
[03:36:02.858 --> 03:36:04.959]  But there are a few tricks that Trump could pull.
[03:36:05.933 --> 03:36:18.001]  Because the funding for an actual wall, if you use the actual wall as sort of a lure, then you can say, all right, I can't get the money, then we're going to build a fence.
[03:36:18.422 --> 03:36:20.263]  And we do have enough money for a fence.
[03:36:21.002 --> 03:36:30.107]  And in essence, a fence can actually be more effective than a giant concrete wall, because you can see through it, you can put manpower behind it, and make it very difficult to climb.
[03:36:30.587 --> 03:36:33.449]  Not like these steel panels that a pregnant lady can hop over.
[03:36:33.969 --> 03:36:39.132]  I'm talking about, like, what they put down in San Diego with triple concertina all the way up the side.
[03:36:39.552 --> 03:36:41.333]  Nobody climbs that stuff, let me tell you.
[03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:44.101]  And that stuff is cheap, relatively cheap.
[03:36:44.561 --> 03:36:47.163]  Pulls out of a truck, you can string the entire border.
[03:36:48.183 --> 03:36:54.347]  The new news is that another caravan's heading for Arizona, where there is no wall, where it's still just a cattle fence.
[03:36:54.947 --> 03:36:57.989]  But, Aaron, we presumably have intel on this.
[03:36:58.509 --> 03:37:00.390]  We'll be able to move the troops and block them.
[03:37:00.971 --> 03:37:06.574]  So it's fantastic that Trump is actually serious about stopping these mass waves.
[03:37:07.654 --> 03:37:10.036]  But it begs the question, what if he's gone in 2020?
[03:37:11.431 --> 03:37:13.853]  Imagine President Kamala Harris.
[03:37:14.733 --> 03:37:16.194]  The border will be wide open.
[03:37:16.334 --> 03:37:24.760]  She'll set up tent cities on the inside to welcome them and, you know, give them driver licenses and Democrat voter cards.
[03:37:25.281 --> 03:37:30.404]  So, in one way of looking at it, Donald Trump is just a reprieve.
[03:37:30.444 --> 03:37:31.525]  He's not a solution.
[03:37:31.905 --> 03:37:32.806]  He's a reprieve.
[03:37:33.306 --> 03:37:40.371]  Eventually, these Democrats who might as well be, you know, they call themselves progressives, democratic socialists,
[03:37:40.991 --> 03:37:42.092]  You know, they're communists.
[03:37:42.132 --> 03:37:43.093]  They're one-worlders.
[03:37:43.594 --> 03:37:46.957]  They don't think America should be an independent, sovereign country.
[03:37:47.838 --> 03:37:48.999]  This is the long game.
[03:37:50.060 --> 03:37:53.944]  There are no successful low-IQ democracies.
[03:37:54.204 --> 03:37:55.665]  I mean, people need to think of that.
[03:37:56.366 --> 03:37:57.006]  There are none.
[03:37:57.847 --> 03:38:05.094]  There were successful low-IQ colonies, you know, where smart people went in and used the manpower.
[03:38:06.420 --> 03:38:09.623]  There are no successful, low-IQ democracies.
[03:38:09.663 --> 03:38:18.830]  And the reason for that is, you'll always get some guy that's like an Idi Amin who's going to run on the, you know, free beer, I'll give everybody a car policy.
[03:38:19.170 --> 03:38:22.893]  Of course it's ridiculous, but that's how Hugo Chavez gets elected.
[03:38:22.913 --> 03:38:29.478]  You know, if you've got a majority of really dumb people, they're going to vote for the guy that promises the moon and the sky.
[03:38:30.479 --> 03:38:35.503]  They're not going to vote for the guy that says, look, we have to work harder, sacrifice, and tighten our budget.
[03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:43.603]  So if the Democrats succeed in opening the borders, eventually America just becomes a third world country.
[03:38:44.064 --> 03:38:45.907]  And this isn't a hypothesis.
[03:38:46.428 --> 03:38:48.893]  All you have to do is look at the state of California.
[03:38:49.614 --> 03:38:55.377]  California, under Reagan in the 50s, the 60s, this was the Beach Boys.
[03:38:55.417 --> 03:38:56.678]  This was the Golden State.
[03:38:57.078 --> 03:39:00.179]  This was the state everybody wanted to move to.
[03:39:00.660 --> 03:39:03.961]  This was where Disney World or Disneyland started.
[03:39:04.382 --> 03:39:07.183]  You know, this was Surfing USA, California Girls.
[03:39:07.563 --> 03:39:14.127]  It was the wealthiest state with the best university system, the best highways, the best everything.
[03:39:14.487 --> 03:39:18.369]  This is where the dad could earn a salary
[03:39:18.969 --> 03:39:20.510]  And the mom didn't even have to work.
[03:39:20.650 --> 03:39:23.571]  The kids could all go to college, two cars, vacations.
[03:39:24.051 --> 03:39:24.651]  Now look at it.
[03:39:25.071 --> 03:39:27.412]  It's a third-world asshole.
[03:39:28.152 --> 03:39:33.154]  And this is because of bringing in just wide-open migration.
[03:39:34.515 --> 03:39:35.715]  There's no magic dirt.
[03:39:35.755 --> 03:39:36.976]  There's no magic air.
[03:39:37.476 --> 03:39:45.639]  If you bring people from countries where they have an average IQ of 80, which is too low to join the military in any job,
[03:39:46.966 --> 03:39:49.907]  They don't get smart because you brought them to America.
[03:39:50.327 --> 03:39:54.468]  They're not going to get smart because you put their butt in a California classroom.
[03:39:55.869 --> 03:40:01.390]  A generation later, their kids are going to still be ADIQ kids.
[03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:08.452]  But one thing's for sure, they're going to vote for the party that promises the biggest social welfare package.
[03:40:08.953 --> 03:40:12.994]  So if you want the entire United States to look like California in 10 or 15 years,
[03:40:14.685 --> 03:40:16.085]  Just to keep the borders open.
[03:40:16.385 --> 03:40:19.406]  So this really is an existential struggle.
[03:40:19.826 --> 03:40:24.147]  And you see that most of the Republicans, they're not even backing Trump on this.
[03:40:24.627 --> 03:40:26.767]  Because they're just as bad as the Democrats.
[03:40:27.307 --> 03:40:31.608]  They want cheap labor for their plants, their factories, their gardeners, their roofers.
[03:40:32.428 --> 03:40:36.189]  They love having cheap peons that'll work for dirt.
[03:40:36.689 --> 03:40:37.209]  They love it.
[03:40:37.609 --> 03:40:40.830]  And they don't care if America becomes a third world country.
[03:40:41.250 --> 03:40:42.570]  If you look at California today,
[03:40:43.391 --> 03:40:45.171]  It's fantastic for the millionaires.
[03:40:45.511 --> 03:40:49.632]  They live in gated communities with private servants and private security.
[03:40:50.133 --> 03:40:59.995]  They don't have, you know, Tim Cook, Zuckerberg, they don't have to worry about the commute going through, you know, tent cities with feces all over the sidewalks.
[03:41:00.395 --> 03:41:01.375]  That's not them.
[03:41:01.435 --> 03:41:03.255]  They fly in helicopters and jets.
[03:41:03.836 --> 03:41:05.676]  So a feudal society
[03:41:06.525 --> 03:41:09.987]  Where the elites live basically in castles is great.
[03:41:10.568 --> 03:41:13.069]  If you're a peasant living outside, it might suck.
[03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:14.230]  But they don't care!
[03:41:14.907 --> 03:41:27.652]  So they can sell globalism as equality, egalitarianism, you know, everybody in the world will be treated equally, but that's the mask, that's the facade.
[03:41:28.172 --> 03:41:41.138]  What's really happening is the world is being turned into a feudal slave plantation with the masters flying jets between castles and the rest of us eventually living in hovels.
[03:41:41.798 --> 03:41:42.819]  That is the plan.
[03:41:43.739 --> 03:42:00.326]  The only countries left that are successful with a high standard of living are high IQ countries where people have a civic base of knowledge, where they know that they just can't vote themselves wealth, that they have to work hard.
[03:42:01.184 --> 03:42:05.008]  These are the only countries that are standing as an obstacle to globalism.
[03:42:05.448 --> 03:42:16.278]  The globalists have to wreck these countries to level the entire planet to the level of, you know, Venezuela, or a country like that, where then they'll rule forever.
[03:42:16.738 --> 03:42:22.824]  Because they'll always be elected by the morons that think they're going to be voting for more free stuff.
[03:42:23.664 --> 03:42:25.246]  You know, it's a simple plan.
[03:42:26.073 --> 03:42:26.993]  And it's devious.
[03:42:27.053 --> 03:42:31.095]  You know, the communists used to wear the hammer and sickle.
[03:42:31.595 --> 03:42:38.838]  They used to fly the flag of communism and promise that they would take over the world and make it all equal.
[03:42:39.158 --> 03:42:43.820]  Well, when the Soviet Union failed, everybody knew that that was no economic model.
[03:42:43.860 --> 03:42:44.660]  That couldn't work.
[03:42:45.301 --> 03:42:46.741]  So they rebranded that.
[03:42:47.261 --> 03:42:49.202]  They just repackaged it.
[03:42:49.262 --> 03:42:52.383]  Globalism is just communism with a smiley face.
[03:42:52.984 --> 03:42:53.964]  That's all it is.
[03:42:54.930 --> 03:42:58.472]  It's just a marketing strategy, but the plan is the same.
[03:43:00.653 --> 03:43:01.594]  We'll see if it works.
[03:43:03.295 --> 03:43:08.978]  Six months ago, InfoWars Life came out with a reformulated, even stronger, even better
[03:43:12.185 --> 03:43:17.128]  And it is the strongest, purest, most high-quality bone broth system out there on the market.
[03:43:17.148 --> 03:43:26.853]  We made sure it was the best, and it's filled with chaga mushroom, it's filled with bee pollen, high-quality turmeric for your joints, for your body, for your muscles, for your bones.
[03:43:27.193 --> 03:43:27.834]  This is
[03:43:28.354 --> 03:43:29.355]  The ultimate superfood.
[03:43:29.696 --> 03:43:34.782]  There's tons of research on basic bone broth, particularly from chicken bones, and that's what this has in it.
[03:43:35.122 --> 03:43:40.989]  But this is concentrated, so it's way, way, way, way stronger than grandma's chicken noodle soup.
[03:43:41.009 --> 03:43:45.955]  You put the other superfoods in there, it's something you simply have to experience yourself.
[03:43:46.095 --> 03:43:47.016]  It is phenomenal.
[03:43:47.256 --> 03:43:54.065]  You need to go to InfoWarsLife.com and read the third-party reviews yourself to see what people are experiencing.
[03:43:54.266 --> 03:43:57.490]  So, we had the new formulation come in about six months ago.
[03:43:57.570 --> 03:43:58.812]  It sold out very, very quickly.
[03:44:00.514 --> 03:44:02.136]  So I put in a huge order.
[03:44:03.141 --> 03:44:07.324]  And we still have 3,000 or 4,000 canisters of this left.
[03:44:07.785 --> 03:44:14.290]  And before the end of the year, so we don't have to pay inventory tax, this is another one of the great items we're offering at cost.
[03:44:15.350 --> 03:44:16.691]  It's 50% off right now, $19.95.
[03:44:17.172 --> 03:44:21.295]  Leading competitors are $50, $60, $70 aren't as strong.
[03:44:21.315 --> 03:44:22.736]  It's normally a great deal at $39.
[03:44:22.776 --> 03:44:25.878]  We usually discount down to about $29.95.
[03:44:25.938 --> 03:44:27.620]  This is $19.95, but this is why this is so special.
[03:44:31.002 --> 03:44:34.103]  You're getting a free gift of a t-shirt.
[03:44:35.724 --> 03:44:37.164]  You're also getting free shipping.
[03:44:37.945 --> 03:44:41.286]  You're also getting double Patriot points instead of five points on the dollar.
[03:44:41.606 --> 03:44:43.406]  Ten cents on the dollar for your next order.
[03:44:43.827 --> 03:44:51.069]  You add all that together and we're losing about five dollars on every order of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:44:51.169 --> 03:44:52.870]  But I want you to try it.
[03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:58.852]  I want you to see how amazing it is because I believe you will then basically be hooked for life like I am.
[03:44:59.815 --> 03:45:02.758]  You talk about strength, stamina, endurance, focus.
[03:45:03.459 --> 03:45:04.199]  There's nothing like it.
[03:45:04.259 --> 03:45:06.261]  The ancients all knew about the power of the bones.
[03:45:06.281 --> 03:45:11.346]  They ground up the bones of horses and cows and chickens and put it in their bread.
[03:45:11.947 --> 03:45:14.970]  And in modern day, that's been taken out the last hundred years out of the bread.
[03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:18.593]  So there's a lot of places we're not getting the essence that's in the bone.
[03:45:18.994 --> 03:45:19.634]  The marrow.
[03:45:20.735 --> 03:45:28.178]  The things that are in the bone structure itself, but it's all in here in Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:28.558 --> 03:45:33.640]  It is the strongest formulation out there, the best, and it has the added benefit of funding the InfoWars.
[03:45:33.700 --> 03:45:37.922]  So, while supplies last right up until Christmas, we're going to sell out quick.
[03:45:38.302 --> 03:45:42.664]  Ultimate Bone Broth is, right now, the best deal you'll ever find, period.
[03:45:42.964 --> 03:45:47.946]  And you get the free t-shirt, free shipping and more at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[03:45:50.527 --> 03:45:57.012]  Alright, there's a couple of really big things that I forgot to tell you and Rob who's shooting this ad reminded me because I don't use a script.
[03:45:58.113 --> 03:46:00.876]  We have store-wide free shipping, not just on Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:46:01.476 --> 03:46:05.680]  And we have 50 to 75% off across the entire store.

[03:46:12.745 --> 03:46:18.190]  And double Patriot points, instead of 5 cents on every dollar, it's 10 cents on every dollar on your future purchase.
[03:46:18.750 --> 03:46:19.671]  This is a big deal.
[03:46:20.291 --> 03:46:30.298]  X2, X3, Super Metal Vitality, Rainforce Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and dozens of other amazing formulas at the lowest prices ever.
[03:46:30.839 --> 03:46:37.263]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds, and support The Info War and get great products all at the same time.
[03:46:37.843 --> 03:46:38.844]  Everything 50 to 75% off.
[03:46:40.265 --> 03:46:42.146]  Double Patriot points and store-wide free shipping.
[03:46:42.406 --> 03:46:44.767]  We're clearing out everything so we don't get hit with the inventory tax.
[03:46:45.267 --> 03:46:48.208]  And it's a big thank you to all of you who supported us over the years.
[03:46:48.528 --> 03:46:50.789]  And I think you'll love these products that you haven't tried so much.
[03:46:51.029 --> 03:46:54.670]  You'll become a regular customer and help fund us into the future under Glovel's attack.
[03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:55.730]  But again, thank you.
[03:46:55.770 --> 03:46:56.591]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[03:46:56.631 --> 03:46:57.171]  God bless you.
[03:46:57.471 --> 03:46:59.011]  And thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[03:46:59.191 --> 03:47:01.132]  Without you we would be shut down a long time ago.
[03:47:01.272 --> 03:47:01.892]  So I salute you.
[03:47:06.754 --> 03:47:09.415]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.696 --> 03:47:28.561]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:30.243 --> 03:47:32.346]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:47:32.826 --> 03:47:35.409]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.803 --> 03:47:41.225]  Okay, Matt Bracken back for the last segment.
[03:47:41.365 --> 03:47:50.653]  And I just want to remind everybody out there that this program, there aren't squirrels running on little wheels to make this thing turn to keep the power going.
[03:47:51.194 --> 03:47:56.518]  It requires people going to the InfoWars store and buying some products.
[03:47:56.578 --> 03:47:57.479]  That's how it runs.
[03:47:58.040 --> 03:48:01.643]  And this is right now day four of the 12 days of Christmas sale.
[03:48:02.223 --> 03:48:03.704]  You can get up to 75% off on your shipping.
[03:48:05.886 --> 03:48:17.751]  Double Patriot points, all kind of specials, and the coolest thing, buy anything and you'll get the free We Are All Alex Jones Gadsden, you know, the snake flag.
[03:48:18.231 --> 03:48:19.071]  Black and white.
[03:48:19.311 --> 03:48:20.232]  Cool as hell.
[03:48:20.812 --> 03:48:21.692]  You're gonna want it.
[03:48:21.972 --> 03:48:22.392]  I want it.
[03:48:22.953 --> 03:48:28.175]  So go to the InfoWars store and load up on products, up to 75% off during the 12 days of Christmas sale.
[03:48:32.248 --> 03:48:34.390]  Okay, we're talking about globalism.
[03:48:34.430 --> 03:48:39.974]  This really is the big war going on, even though it's not announced.
[03:48:40.154 --> 03:48:41.535]  It's not public.
[03:48:42.216 --> 03:48:56.047]  The progressives, the globalists, the socialists, they learned that the hammer and sickle and the picture of Joseph Stalin, people aren't lining up to get that because it failed as an economic model.
[03:48:56.507 --> 03:49:00.030]  This didn't mean that the commies converted to capitalism.
[03:49:00.780 --> 03:49:04.722]  All this means is that they regrouped and rebranded.
[03:49:04.762 --> 03:49:06.663]  They got better marketing experts in.
[03:49:07.323 --> 03:49:11.385]  And the new marketing is globalism, one world.
[03:49:11.725 --> 03:49:13.466]  Doesn't everybody want to be equal?
[03:49:14.046 --> 03:49:18.988]  But the real result of this is going to be, I mean, a one world government.
[03:49:19.048 --> 03:49:21.789]  Imagine it can only be a totalitarian tyranny.
[03:49:21.849 --> 03:49:22.709]  There's no other way.
[03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:26.071]  Just look at the European Union as an example.
[03:49:26.776 --> 03:49:32.106]  If the EU has to crush individual states, open the borders, flood them with migrants...
[03:49:32.805 --> 03:49:36.566]  Then imagine how disconnected a world government will be.
[03:49:37.046 --> 03:49:46.149]  How tyrannical and disconnected that would have to be to fit every square, round, triangular peg into the same hole would require a big hammer.
[03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:49.871]  And whether it can actually ever work is another question.
[03:49:50.291 --> 03:49:53.092]  But there's no doubt that the globalists are trying.
[03:49:53.812 --> 03:49:59.974]  And even if they can't succeed in their global vision, which is a dystopian nightmare as far as I'm concerned,
[03:50:00.777 --> 03:50:12.045]  They can wreck the last remaining sovereign, high-affluence, successful Democratic Republic countries like the USA.
[03:50:12.425 --> 03:50:14.367]  They're succeeding in Europe.
[03:50:15.087 --> 03:50:16.829]  There's a new error I saw today.
[03:50:16.889 --> 03:50:21.572]  When you get a connection, like a bad connection, you get a 404 or some error like that.
[03:50:22.384 --> 03:50:29.291]  I sent links to a friend in Europe today about the Apple Tim Cook censorship speech.
[03:50:29.671 --> 03:50:32.334]  You know, no white nationalism on Apple.
[03:50:33.915 --> 03:50:35.757]  They'll decide what is hate speech.
[03:50:36.998 --> 03:50:39.241]  My friend in Europe got ERA 451.
[03:50:39.281 --> 03:50:40.502]  He couldn't open up the links.
[03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:44.432]  It says unavailable due to legal reasons.
[03:50:45.113 --> 03:50:48.096]  It's the General Data Protection Regulation.
[03:50:48.636 --> 03:51:01.088]  So you can't open a link in Europe and it's just under this GDPR, which who knows what that really means, but basically you can't see things in Europe.
[03:51:02.129 --> 03:51:03.751]  Websites are just verboten.
[03:51:04.500 --> 03:51:06.360]  So, that's Europe today.
[03:51:06.841 --> 03:51:08.421]  Imagine a global government.
[03:51:08.921 --> 03:51:20.083]  It will only be a tyranny run by, you know, the Zuckerbergs, the Tim Cooks, the Jack Dorseys, and the Chinese, you know, the Google guys working for the Chai-coms.
[03:51:20.543 --> 03:51:33.426]  In fact, you know, I was just kicked off of Twitter for, I guess you'd call it Islamophobia, for posting a meme showing a progression of burqas from like a loose hijab to a blacked-out burqa.
[03:51:34.193 --> 03:51:36.514]  And I was thrown off for Islamophobia.
[03:51:37.714 --> 03:51:49.118]  Christians not in Muslim countries are being kicked off of Twitter because in Pakistan people object to a meme against burqas and kneecaps.
[03:51:49.818 --> 03:51:58.902]  Jack Dorsey's actually endorsing Sharia blasphemy laws under the guise of anti-hate.
[03:51:58.962 --> 03:52:03.023]  I guess it's hateful to say that women shouldn't be forced to wear a black burqa.
[03:52:03.669 --> 03:52:05.971]  I mean, this is the sick world we're living in.
[03:52:06.051 --> 03:52:09.793]  So I'm still on Facebook, barely by my fingernails.
[03:52:10.293 --> 03:52:15.357]  I've been given six different 30-day bans in the last year.
[03:52:15.377 --> 03:52:20.420]  I don't post any kind of edgy memes anymore there because I'll just get banned again.
[03:52:21.461 --> 03:52:24.883]  I'm on a new startup called FreeZoxy.com, people can check out.
[03:52:25.363 --> 03:52:30.506]  But it's, you know, we're being hemmed in from all directions.
[03:52:32.428 --> 03:52:34.549]  In the EU, websites are banned.
[03:52:35.509 --> 03:52:37.790]  People are being kicked off of Facebook and Twitter.
[03:52:39.151 --> 03:52:51.476]  The latest thing is going after payment so that websites and even persons that are deemed to be politically incorrect will be unable to use credit card clearing.
[03:52:51.516 --> 03:52:53.916]  There's Stripe, Patreon, PayPal.
[03:52:55.617 --> 03:52:57.738]  In China, they call it social credit.
[03:52:58.331 --> 03:53:04.818]  But in the United States, they just say, your internet business will be prevented from doing business.
[03:53:05.458 --> 03:53:07.060]  I mean, is that really any better?
[03:53:07.260 --> 03:53:15.589]  I mean, we can still get on the train, I guess, unlike in China, but you can't run an internet business if Big Brother determines that you're a bad guy.
[03:53:16.069 --> 03:53:21.375]  And this can even involve a bunch of Islamists getting together to call you an Islamophobe.
[03:53:21.935 --> 03:53:24.356]  This happened to Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch.
[03:53:24.776 --> 03:53:26.436]  He's a hero of freedom.
[03:53:26.456 --> 03:53:28.776]  He's trying to protect Western civilization.
[03:53:29.276 --> 03:53:35.578]  Islamists gang up, go to the credit card companies, and make it impossible for him to, you know, sell books.
[03:53:36.138 --> 03:53:40.899]  I mean, it's really a sick and dangerous world, but, you know, we need to fight back.
[03:53:40.979 --> 03:53:45.660]  And one way to do it is to support all kind of alternative platforms.
[03:53:46.340 --> 03:53:47.900]  Flood the zone with
[03:53:48.726 --> 03:53:55.693]  With the social media and websites out of the control of the Tim Cooks and the Zuckerbergs and the Dorseys.
[03:53:56.313 --> 03:54:03.220]  And that would be places like BitChute, FreeZoxy, Gab.
[03:54:03.340 --> 03:54:05.822]  There are lots of other websites out there.
[03:54:05.882 --> 03:54:06.963]  You have to seek them out.
[03:54:08.505 --> 03:54:10.246]  They're not going to be laid in front of you.
[03:54:11.107 --> 03:54:12.949]  They're not necessarily going to be free.
[03:54:12.969 --> 03:54:14.310]  They might require donations.
[03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:20.055]  Just remember, on the giant megacorporate websites, free means you're the product.
[03:54:20.555 --> 03:54:27.021]  You know, when they say Facebook is free, that means they're data mining every move that you make.
[03:54:27.081 --> 03:54:34.508]  Your locations, everything that you purchase, they're selling that to their corporate advertisers.
[03:54:34.888 --> 03:54:36.830]  I mean, you can have your cell phone turned off
[03:54:37.410 --> 03:54:41.974]  And if you talk about dogs, when you turn your cell phone on, you're going to get a dog food commercial.
[03:54:42.495 --> 03:54:45.317]  I mean, it's a big brother to the nth degree.
[03:54:45.678 --> 03:54:49.461]  So don't make the mistake of thinking that Facebook and Twitter are free.
[03:54:49.941 --> 03:55:03.033]  Basically, you're volunteering for a Chinese-style social credit system where they're harvesting your most personal private information, listening to your conversations, whether your phone's on or off.
[03:55:03.553 --> 03:55:07.775]  You know, and crunching all that and storing that information.
[03:55:08.295 --> 03:55:09.816]  I mean, it's a crazy time.
[03:55:09.896 --> 03:55:15.018]  So, you know, support the InfoWars store, support independent social media.
[03:55:16.379 --> 03:55:17.159]  Make the effort.
[03:55:17.219 --> 03:55:19.200]  I know Facebook and Twitter, they're slick.
[03:55:19.640 --> 03:55:20.701]  They work great.
[03:55:21.061 --> 03:55:25.803]  You know, all the apps are set up to steer you to them, which is no coincidence.
[03:55:26.163 --> 03:55:27.664]  But make the extra effort.
[03:55:28.234 --> 03:55:31.496]  Get out, get off the social justice plantation.
[03:55:31.976 --> 03:55:40.340]  Don't just, you know, self-censor and turn yourself way down on Twitter and Facebook so that you won't be kicked off.
[03:55:41.041 --> 03:55:52.247]  And for that matter, another reason to get off is, you might have, you know, umpteen thousand followers, but if you're only getting one share or one retweet, you know they've dialed your volume down to one.
[03:55:52.787 --> 03:55:56.549]  People tell me on Facebook, I don't show up on their timeline, they have to seek me out.
[03:55:57.291 --> 03:56:00.934]  That's how it was on Twitter before I was permabanned for Islamophobia.
[03:56:01.475 --> 03:56:03.136]  So, don't cooperate.
[03:56:03.236 --> 03:56:22.212]  Don't just, you know, be such a sap that you just are always, you know, you talk about freedom and you talk about, you know, fighting for liberty, but then you line right up to get on the big slick Jack Dorsey bus or the Mark Zuckerberg bus where they make you sit in the back and shut up, you know, on the hard seats.
[03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:27.875]  Just get off that bus and find one that might be a new little bus, but make it run.
[03:56:28.596 --> 03:56:39.266]  Don't just keep your social media adversaries flush with billions of dollars to then donate to the Democrats to work against us.
[03:56:39.286 --> 03:56:41.688]  I mean, this country's on the edge.
[03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:46.433]  If Florida and Texas, just for two examples, they're on a knife edge.
[03:56:47.188 --> 03:56:49.649]  They would have stolen Florida in the midterms.
[03:56:50.009 --> 03:56:53.351]  They just didn't have enough fake ballots hidden away.
[03:56:53.871 --> 03:56:55.251]  They needed 80,000.
[03:56:55.311 --> 03:56:56.512]  They had 60,000.
[03:56:56.572 --> 03:56:57.992]  They missed it by that much.
[03:56:58.873 --> 03:57:02.194]  So, the next time, I'm sure they'll have 100,000 fake ballots.
[03:57:02.674 --> 03:57:05.696]  In California, they're doing this vote harvesting.
[03:57:06.136 --> 03:57:12.719]  They flipped all these congressional districts in Republican Orange County after the fact by quote-unquote vote harvesting.
[03:57:13.239 --> 03:57:14.639]  And Texas was a razor thin.
[03:57:16.946 --> 03:57:17.366]  Margin.
[03:57:17.447 --> 03:57:20.849]  If Texas and Florida goes, they could be like California.
[03:57:21.329 --> 03:57:22.410]  This country's finished.
[03:57:23.011 --> 03:57:25.412]  So, you know, we can't just play their game.
[03:57:25.452 --> 03:57:36.481]  We have to get our own game going, and that means going on InfoWars store, buying InfoWars product, and then seeking out alternative social media.
[03:57:37.021 --> 03:57:38.642]  Get off of Twitter and Facebook.
[03:57:40.063 --> 03:57:42.845]  Anyway, this is Matt Bracken, and I'll see you the next time.
[03:57:42.865 --> 03:57:43.506]  Couple weeks.
[03:57:52.842 --> 03:58:00.887]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[03:58:01.187 --> 03:58:12.313]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[03:58:12.613 --> 03:58:20.418]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.

[03:58:30.482 --> 03:58:37.505]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the New World Order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty and trying to shut down the free press is.
[03:58:37.905 --> 03:58:45.949]  And that's why when you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, you don't just give yourself the gift of high quality supplements, or storable foods, or incredible water filtration.
