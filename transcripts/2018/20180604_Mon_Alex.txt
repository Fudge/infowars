[00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.201]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:29.448]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:30.968]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:39.113]  It's Monday, June 4th, 2018, and we are smack dab in the middle of human history.
[00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:41.314]  The next Great Awakening.
[00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.261]  The second American revolution is all upon us and there's all kinds of breaking news today that we're going to have to get to.
[00:00:49.261 --> 00:01:06.265]  And a very exciting video that you're going to love of Alex Jones who just happens to be traveling right now and sees a certain communist, socialist, former presidential candidate who threw his supporters under the bus at the airport.
[00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.246]  I think you can probably guess who it is.
[00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:16.487]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor, says the good Jew.
[00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:20.208]  And Alex Jones ran into him at the airport.
[00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:21.508]  And you're going to love that video.
[00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:31.711]  But first, some breaking news in the PedoGate stories as perhaps an undercover dungeon was discovered by a veterans activist group.
[00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.951]  Here's that report from John Bowne.
[00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:43.475]  This is Nathan Larson, an accountant from Charlottesville, Virginia, running as an independent candidate in Virginia's congressional election.
[00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.778]  This is hard to read and certainly hard to hear.
[00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:50.403]  He admittedly thinks it's okay for adults to have sex with children.
[00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:52.025]  He even wants to make it legal.
[00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:59.011]  Normally, we don't give people with abhorrent beliefs a platform in which to share those ideas.
[00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.272]  But this man is running for Congress.
[00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:08.997]  And as much as I personally hate to put this man on TV, we believe it's important for people to know why he's running for Congress.
[00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:14.962]  Nathan Larson told me he wants to, quote, restore liberty and make incest legal.
[00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:18.264]  What about sexual relations with your own children?
[00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:26.657]  Like, I would favor, like, legalizing incest.
[00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:28.078]  Why is that?
[00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:31.000]  Just because, uh, personal freedom.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.882]  What about the children's rights?
[00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:38.083]  Wouldn't that be rape to have sex with a child?
[00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:47.248]  Um, well, like, like with girls, I mean, I just believe that it should be for fathers to make those decisions.
[00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:49.049]  And you don't find anything wrong with that?
[00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:54.650]  I mean, it's not for me to intrude on another family and tell them what they should do.
[00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.392]  Wouldn't that be really dangerous for children?
[00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:59.315]  I don't see how we know that.
[00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:01.398]  Children are human beings.
[00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:02.219]  They're not property.
[00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.502]  What about their protection?
[00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:10.525]  The law doesn't treat them as having the full rights of adults.
[00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:16.509]  Nathan Larson also told me he doesn't think wives should be allowed to accuse their husbands of rape.
[00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:25.634]  Now I talked to the Virginia State Board of Elections and they tell me that Nathan Larson is not an official candidate because independence cannot be official until June 12th.
[00:03:25.634 --> 00:03:31.098]  But, Larson says he's gotten the required 1,000 signatures and filed the paperwork.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.063]  It really doesn't get any more insane than that.
[00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:49.718]  And if Larson, who has described himself as a quasi-neo-reactionary libertarian, finds himself in prison for raping his ex-wife or assaulting a minor, there's a good chance Larson the Chester won't make it out alive.
[00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:56.423]  What kind of society would allow someone like Larson to even come out of the shadows?
[00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.925]  A culture that sexualizes children, that's what.
[00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:08.991]  In a statement to LifeSite News, the Boy Scouts of America said that condoms will be made available through the medical facilities set up throughout the camps.
[00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:14.072]  Where an estimated 50,000 are expected to attend.
[00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:19.354]  Is this a sure ticket to a merit badge for not knocking your girlfriend up?
[00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:23.155]  Or is there something far more sinister at play?
[00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:29.097]  In 2010, a jury ordered that the scouts pay $18.5 million to a scout who was abused in the 1980s.
[00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:35.459]  It was the largest punitive damages award to a single plaintiff in a child abuse case in the United States.
[00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:42.380]  This after 2,000 Boy Scout rape cases had been reported previous to 1994.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:53.383]  Morality, which is essential to the continuation of our society, has been run roughshod since Obama reigned in the PC culture that has opened doors for predators.
[00:04:53.383 --> 00:04:57.204]  Larson... Alright, all the breaking news and a breaking video from Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:04:57.204 --> 00:04:57.724]  Don't go anywhere.

[00:06:12.517 --> 00:06:14.859]  It's Owen Troyer.
[00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:21.722]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:21.722 --> 00:06:31.287]  Here we are on Monday, June 4th, 2018, and Alex Jones, while trying to take a vacation in the middle of the storm,
[00:06:33.504 --> 00:06:41.510]  Arrives at LA International, where he runs into who other than Crazy Bernie.
[00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.091]  Crazy is a bed bug, they say.
[00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:52.817]  And, well, let's just say the confrontation was everything that you would expect it to be, and we are getting that exclusive footage ready for you.
[00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:59.336]  To be debuted here on the Alex Jones Show for your viewing and listening pleasure.
[00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.098]  Filling in for Alex Jones, I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:05.504]  Obviously a ton of breaking news to get to.
[00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:07.707]  I'm not sure what the most important is.
[00:07:07.707 --> 00:07:08.929]  I've got a list here.
[00:07:10.674 --> 00:07:18.221]  That I might just read this full story, complete list of President Trump's historic accomplishments after first 500 days in office.
[00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:22.504]  I might have to just read this entire article for a segment.
[00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:25.527]  Because nobody else is going to highlight this.
[00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:32.794]  You're not going to hear this on the national news syndicates, the ABCs, the NBCs, the CBSes.
[00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:36.146]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:44.429]  You're just going to hear more of the same Trump-Russia, Trump-Stormy Daniels, Trump-animals, Trump-bigot.
[00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:46.951]  You've heard it all before.
[00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:50.212]  So there's that.
[00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:54.714]  You've got now two examples of Google
[00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:09.055]  First saying the California Republican Party was Nazi, now saying Trudy Wade, a Republican Senator from North Carolina, is a bigot.
[00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:15.259]  And using a picture of her labeled as bigot in the search results.
[00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:22.945]  Now, Devin Nunes has said Google may need to testify if anti-GOP search results keep showing up.
[00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:25.267]  Now, let me tell you why this is so important.
[00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:41.248]  If this is actual individuals, still humans, that work at Google, going in there and programming it to come up with these results, that's an issue.
[00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:52.660]  If this is Google's AI learning organically this information and then plugging those algorithms in itself, then that's an even bigger concern.
[00:08:54.113 --> 00:09:02.282]  And I remember when I was thinking about this whole AI rollout, which, by the way, in case you haven't noticed, the AI rollout is here.
[00:09:02.282 --> 00:09:04.864]  Have you not seen all the commercials on television?
[00:09:04.864 --> 00:09:08.948]  Have you not seen the robot in Saudi Arabia becoming a citizen?
[00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.890]  So the AI rollout is now.
[00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.172]  It's happening right now.
[00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:22.751]  And if AI is learning organically from what it reads and sees on the internet, maybe the Google AI really thinks Republicans are Nazis.
[00:09:22.751 --> 00:09:30.117]  Maybe the Google AI really thinks that Trudy Wade is a bigot.
[00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:33.620]  Now, do you see the dangerous precedent being set in that regard?
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.065]  There's Sophia, the first robot citizen in Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:39.686]  It's got rights.
[00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:51.373]  Oh yeah, won't you just love it when they roll out the AI bots, your personal assistant, and then they get voting rights?
[00:09:51.373 --> 00:10:01.439]  As if the electronic voting machines aren't enough to just let our elections be totally hacked and rigged, let's just let the AI robots vote too.
[00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:08.683]  After all, they're citizens, they have rights.
[00:10:08.683 --> 00:10:10.004]  But I'm digressing here.
[00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:13.947]  That's what the AI is now doing.
[00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:19.111]  So that's why it's important that Google, I think, should testify to this.
[00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:24.936]  Is this an individual plugging in these algorithms, or is this your AI?
[00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:30.940]  And if it is your AI, boy, aren't we looking at a bigger issue here?
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:36.044]  So that's one of the top stories for me today.
[00:10:36.044 --> 00:10:36.685]  Meanwhile,
[00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:47.628]  England's top family judge, society should welcome and applaud the decline of nuclear families.
[00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:56.050]  Well, yes, if you want the decline of society, if you want the decline of civilization.
[00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:07.254]  Oh, they don't have the studies that say a fatherless home increases the child's chances of winding up in jail, dropping out of school,
[00:11:08.717 --> 00:11:09.918]  Doing illicit drugs.
[00:11:09.918 --> 00:11:12.839]  They don't have those studies.
[00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:18.162]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:24.886]  So now they're going to say you should be celebrating the decline of nuclear families.
[00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:32.370]  And of course, they'll probably wind up on the conclusion that it's racist.
[00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.431]  No, anybody can have a nuclear family.
[00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:37.525]  Anybody can have parents in the household.
[00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:39.146]  This isn't a race thing.
[00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:42.829]  This is a destruction of society thing.
[00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:50.136]  And so then it gets twisted and they say, no, we should be applauding this.
[00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:52.578]  Yes, you should be applauding your own demise.
[00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:59.098]  The same twisted logic is used and applied to President Trump.
[00:11:59.098 --> 00:12:01.239]  President Trump is anti-American.
[00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:01.579]  Oh, really?
[00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:03.920]  He's just saving the American economy?
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.441]  Obama said... How about Obama?
[00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:09.502]  This is the guy that said, what, does Trump have a magic wand?
[00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:11.442]  You can't bring those jobs back.
[00:12:11.442 --> 00:12:13.063]  You can't bring the economy back.
[00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:13.763]  That's just how it is.
[00:12:13.763 --> 00:12:15.364]  Whoa, you think he has a magic wand?
[00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:19.760]  Okay, then what happens?
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.162]  Trump gets elected.
[00:12:21.162 --> 00:12:22.284]  Jobs come back.
[00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:23.386]  Record jobs numbers.
[00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:24.387]  Record jobs growth.
[00:12:24.387 --> 00:12:26.951]  Economy growth.
[00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:27.632]  Unemployment.
[00:12:27.632 --> 00:12:28.534]  Record lows.
[00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:29.556]  Oh, it all happens.
[00:12:29.556 --> 00:12:30.497]  Where's the magic wand?
[00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:33.065]  I guess it's just President Trump.
[00:12:33.065 --> 00:12:39.147]  But then what does Obama say in the new Ben Rhodes book, who gets a job at MSNBC?
[00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:46.529]  Ben Rhodes, who fumbles and bumbles and stutters and moans his way through an interview after the election, he gets a job at MSNBC.
[00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:53.050]  And then they'll make fun of us, even though we have no teleprompters, no writers, they rely on that for a one-hour magazine-style program.
[00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.311]  We're three, four hours live, nothing but real.
[00:12:56.889 --> 00:12:58.090]  But now, let me get back to it.
[00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.892]  So then Obama says, oh, what do you have, a magic wand?
[00:13:00.892 --> 00:13:02.333]  There's no jobs coming back.
[00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.594]  There's no economy coming back.
[00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:06.296]  Jobs come back, economy comes back.
[00:13:06.296 --> 00:13:08.517]  What does Obama say in Ben Rhodes' new book?
[00:13:08.517 --> 00:13:12.300]  Boy, I really set the economy up nicely for him.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.901]  What a fraud!
[00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:15.262]  What a phony!
[00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:19.085]  Who doesn't see through that?
[00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:20.646]  They don't think you have a memory, folks.
[00:13:20.646 --> 00:13:23.768]  Barack Obama thinks you don't have a memory.
[00:13:23.768 --> 00:13:26.330]  He thinks you have the mind of a goldfish.
[00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:30.827]  There it is.
[00:13:30.827 --> 00:13:32.628]  New book says Obama.
[00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:35.528]  Says, I've got the economy set up well for him.
[00:13:35.528 --> 00:13:37.889]  Boy, I wonder how soon after.
[00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:41.289]  I'd like to see a timeline of that, if you believe Ben Rhodes' book.
[00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.030]  I bet it's all made up dribble.
[00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:51.691]  Regardless, he'll probably claim that Obama said that just mere months after his magic wand comment.
[00:13:51.691 --> 00:13:55.072]  Wow, what an amazing turn of opinion you had, Obama.
[00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:57.969]  And there's President Trump on Twitter.
[00:14:09.673 --> 00:14:10.834]  Military and vets.
[00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:12.035]  I had a veterans call-in show.
[00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:13.376]  The VA is getting better.
[00:14:13.376 --> 00:14:15.338]  Lower crime and illegal immigration.
[00:14:15.338 --> 00:14:16.319]  They're working on it.
[00:14:16.319 --> 00:14:19.101]  It's actually, look at the gun crime in Chicago is actually going down.
[00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:20.142]  Stronger borders.
[00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:21.163]  Well, we're working on that.
[00:14:21.163 --> 00:14:23.164]  I'm not sure if it's quite there yet.
[00:14:23.164 --> 00:14:23.765]  Judge ships.
[00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:25.546]  We just had a good Supreme Court decision.
[00:14:25.546 --> 00:14:26.227]  Best economy.
[00:14:26.227 --> 00:14:26.967]  That's inarguable.
[00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:28.809]  Jobs, numbers, and much, much more.
[00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:29.930]  I may have to read the full story.
[00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:34.856]  I have to read the story because no one else will do it.
[00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:37.059]  That's why InfoWars is so important.
[00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:39.983]  Now, we have extended specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:14:39.983 --> 00:14:41.005]  This is ridiculous.
[00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.026]  I came in today.
[00:14:42.026 --> 00:14:43.688]  I said, I need the new specials.
[00:14:43.688 --> 00:14:44.409]  What are the new specials?
[00:14:44.409 --> 00:14:45.911]  They said, oh, and we still have the same specials.
[00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:48.214]  So these specials are already ridiculous.
[00:14:48.314 --> 00:14:48.514]  I think.
[00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:12.820]  25% off Survival Shield X2.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.602]  The specials just go on and on.
[00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:15.944]  Alpha Power 50% off.
[00:15:15.944 --> 00:15:18.487]  Super Male Vitality 50% off.
[00:15:18.487 --> 00:15:20.670]  And free shipping storewide.
[00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.392]  I mean, that is huge.
[00:15:22.392 --> 00:15:25.676]  Especially if you're placing a large order that may be heavier.
[00:15:26.604 --> 00:15:31.268]  Like an air filter, a water filter, or emergency food supplies.
[00:15:31.268 --> 00:15:32.970]  So it's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.992]  The Patriots special from Memorial Day is still extended.
[00:15:35.992 --> 00:15:37.974]  This is not going to last much longer, folks.
[00:15:37.974 --> 00:15:43.579]  I would take advantage of 50% off almost half the store and free shipping storewide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:45.440]  And you're supporting the good guys!
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.364]  You're supporting the news that's going to bring you the truth with no holds barred!
[00:15:50.004 --> 00:15:53.711]  And have Alex Jones see Bernie Sanders at an airport in L.A.
[00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:55.014]  and Bernie Sanders literally runs away!
[00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:55.334]  He ran!
[00:15:59.807 --> 00:16:00.608]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.608 --> 00:16:02.429]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?

[00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:31.090]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:29.259]  Woo!
[00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:30.279]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:39.022]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:39.022 --> 00:18:47.124]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:18:48.604 --> 00:18:52.046]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.632]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:19:03.632 --> 00:19:04.853]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:19:05.393 --> 00:19:06.014]  We're good to go!
[00:19:22.756 --> 00:19:23.016]  Let's go!
[00:19:40.288 --> 00:19:42.030]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:52.018]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:19:52.018 --> 00:19:54.660]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:03.347]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:20:03.347 --> 00:20:06.029]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:26.163]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:28.044]  There it is!
[00:20:28.044 --> 00:20:29.665]  Oh, I gotta get the meme back up.
[00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:30.746]  Alex Jones!
[00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:38.516]  You know, even if Alex Jones tries to take a vacation, the world just keeps dragging him back.
[00:20:38.516 --> 00:20:40.338]  That's the power of the universe.
[00:20:40.338 --> 00:20:47.844]  He runs into Bernie Sanders at LA International, and look at the stunned face of Bernie Sanders.
[00:20:47.844 --> 00:20:51.127]  Oh my gosh.
[00:20:51.127 --> 00:20:52.308]  That's just too good, man!
[00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:59.932]  Oh, it's like, can you even get a hairbrush or something, bro?
[00:20:59.932 --> 00:21:01.473]  I mean, a comb?
[00:21:01.473 --> 00:21:06.115]  What's a comb cost, like 10 cents a nickel?
[00:21:06.115 --> 00:21:08.277]  Unbelievable.
[00:21:08.277 --> 00:21:11.339]  So Alex Jones runs into Bernie Sanders at LAX.
[00:21:11.339 --> 00:21:13.320]  Boy, you cannot make that up.
[00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.311]  So we said, Alex, just take a vacation.
[00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.092]  Everybody needs a vacation, Alex.
[00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:20.892]  You can do it.
[00:21:20.892 --> 00:21:25.233]  We know that wild horses couldn't drag you away, but just commit and just do it.
[00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:27.074]  He said, all right, I'm going.
[00:21:27.074 --> 00:21:27.894]  And then what happens?
[00:21:27.894 --> 00:21:32.275]  The universe says, Alex, here's Bernie Sanders.
[00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:35.056]  Why don't you confront him?
[00:21:35.056 --> 00:21:35.696]  So Alex did.
[00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:36.917]  Of course he did.
[00:21:36.917 --> 00:21:44.279]  And Bernie Sanders ran like, well, like a little ant, or better yet, a cockroach.
[00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:48.446]  Running from the light.
[00:21:48.446 --> 00:21:57.731]  So we're going to debut that video that we are getting together right now from Alex Jones confronting Bernie Sanders at LA International.
[00:21:57.731 --> 00:22:03.653]  Also coming up, I didn't even plug this and I should have because you're seeing what's going on in Italy.
[00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:12.198]  Again, InfoWars was at the front lines of this and again we're bringing on one of the spearheaders of this movement, Leo Zagami, who's been
[00:22:13.303 --> 00:22:16.308]  In the know about the populist uprise in Italy.
[00:22:16.308 --> 00:22:20.595]  Of course, he's well tied into the Vatican and everything there, knows about the secret societies.
[00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:26.124]  But he's really been involved with his website and his work and his reporting at leozugami.com.
[00:22:28.291 --> 00:22:32.614]  to get this populist uprising through and to force it through.
[00:22:32.614 --> 00:22:39.598]  And now George Soros is even responding to the populist uprising in Italy, the nationalist uprising in Italy.
[00:22:39.598 --> 00:22:43.621]  So Leo Zagami joining me at 12 to discuss that.
[00:22:43.621 --> 00:22:44.702]  You're not going to want to miss that.
[00:22:45.626 --> 00:22:53.534]  And then at one, Andrey Afanasyev joins me from Sargrad.tv.
[00:22:53.534 --> 00:22:57.457]  He is a good Russian source for all news when it comes to Russia.
[00:22:57.457 --> 00:22:59.600]  Of course, you've got the Ukrainian fake death.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.400]  You've got weird...
[00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:03.663]  News coming out about the Skripals.
[00:23:03.663 --> 00:23:15.493]  And I want to tie those two things together to show you how they can fake deaths, or stage deaths, or false flag deaths, and then they're trying to blame Russia for it.
[00:23:15.493 --> 00:23:19.937]  So we'll talk with Andrei Afanasyev about that.
[00:23:19.937 --> 00:23:25.482]  Then Matt Bracken from enemiesforeignanddomestic.com will be the host in the fourth hour, of course.
[00:23:25.482 --> 00:23:28.425]  He's the expert when it comes to the domestic issues, I think.
[00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:37.351]  Where they're staging certain events to bring apart an agenda which always leads to an attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:23:37.351 --> 00:23:46.432]  You heard that yesterday from Caller Zack, or RQAnon if you will, on the Alex Jones Show talking about Fort Hood.
[00:23:46.432 --> 00:23:53.294]  So all of that's going on, but here's what I want to do in the next five minutes, because I've still got big news to get to, but I don't like just saying things
[00:23:54.687 --> 00:24:23.267]  Because there's a lot of people that are probably new to this audience, and instead of being like Bill Maher, who just says, Alex Jones says this, Alex Jones believes that, Alex Jones reported this, and then plays zero clips, gives you zero evidence, which just gives him the floor to just lie and slander and make things up about Alex Jones, all lies, and I wonder if Bill Maher even realizes he's a total liar, or if his writers just set him up to be that way, or maybe they're all that ignorant.
[00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.957]  But we're not like Bill Maher!
[00:24:26.946 --> 00:24:28.607]  We don't have a team of riders.
[00:24:28.607 --> 00:24:30.167]  We don't have teleprompters.
[00:24:30.167 --> 00:24:34.129]  Bill Maher couldn't do a show without a team of riders and teleprompters.
[00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:45.554]  In fact, all the media outlets that want to point the finger at InfoWars and call us names and try to dehumanize us wouldn't last a day without their team of riders and without their teleprompters.
[00:24:45.554 --> 00:24:48.435]  We go 10 hours a day without any of it.
[00:24:48.435 --> 00:24:56.179]  But unlike the fake news, unlike the fake Bill Maher, I'm going to give you evidence to what I said about Barack Obama.
[00:24:57.605 --> 00:25:00.647]  Do we have both the clips now, guys?
[00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:10.292]  So first, let's go to Barack Obama, this is just fun, saying that you didn't build that business, don't take responsibility for that.
[00:25:10.292 --> 00:25:17.976]  Just so you understand the mindset of Obama before we go into this, let's go to Obama telling you how he feels about your hard effort.
[00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:22.238]  In roads and bridges, if you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:25:22.238 --> 00:25:22.678]  No.
[00:25:22.678 --> 00:25:24.219]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:28.952]  The internet didn't get invented on its own.
[00:25:28.952 --> 00:25:31.193]  Government research created the internet.
[00:25:31.193 --> 00:25:34.656]  So then all the companies could make money off the internet.
[00:25:34.656 --> 00:25:40.481]  You know, that's actually an interesting little addition there that he admits that DARPA created the internet there.
[00:25:40.481 --> 00:25:43.244]  But okay, regardless, that's how he feels.
[00:25:43.244 --> 00:25:45.386]  You know, you built that, you didn't build that.
[00:25:45.386 --> 00:25:47.728]  You created a business, you didn't create that business.
[00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:49.890]  So that, but what is really behind that?
[00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:54.030]  So he's saying that you don't get credit for your hard work.
[00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.232]  You don't deserve to take credit for what you've done, what you've accomplished.
[00:25:57.232 --> 00:26:00.055]  First of all, that's a communist mindset to go into it.
[00:26:00.055 --> 00:26:01.456]  But let's come back to that.
[00:26:01.456 --> 00:26:14.727]  Now let's go to Obama during the 2016 presidential election cycle, when President Trump was saying, campaigning on the issues of jobs, getting jobs to come back, and listen to what President Obama said then.
[00:26:14.727 --> 00:26:15.888]  When somebody says,
[00:26:17.805 --> 00:26:21.287]  Like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for.
[00:26:21.287 --> 00:26:22.128]  President Trump.
[00:26:22.128 --> 00:26:23.789]  That he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:25.010]  President.
[00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.391]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:28.732]  What are you going to do?
[00:26:28.732 --> 00:26:31.374]  There's no answer to it.
[00:26:31.374 --> 00:26:35.417]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[00:26:35.417 --> 00:26:38.979]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:26:38.979 --> 00:26:41.581]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:26:41.581 --> 00:26:44.823]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[00:26:47.145 --> 00:26:49.527]  Oh, but what's Obama's answer?
[00:26:49.527 --> 00:26:51.890]  So now here we are.
[00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.712]  Unemployment record low.
[00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.353]  Jobs growth record high.
[00:26:55.353 --> 00:26:57.155]  Record stock markets.
[00:26:57.155 --> 00:26:59.278]  I mean, just huge numbers.
[00:26:59.278 --> 00:27:01.139]  Repatriation of funds.
[00:27:01.139 --> 00:27:02.261]  Pay raises.
[00:27:02.261 --> 00:27:08.307]  I mean, just all across the board, all measurements point to the economy going up.
[00:27:11.488 --> 00:27:13.949]  GDP is about to hit 4%.
[00:27:13.949 --> 00:27:14.929]  But then what does Obama say?
[00:27:14.929 --> 00:27:18.351]  Well, first he says, you didn't build that, you didn't do that.
[00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:20.612]  Then he says, you can't bring the jobs back.
[00:27:20.612 --> 00:27:22.012]  You must have a magic wand.
[00:27:22.012 --> 00:27:23.093]  There's no such thing as a magic wand.
[00:27:23.093 --> 00:27:23.493]  You can't do it.
[00:27:23.493 --> 00:27:23.753]  It's over.
[00:27:23.753 --> 00:27:25.193]  It's over for America.
[00:27:25.193 --> 00:27:31.716]  Then Trump gets in, actually does that, actually builds that, actually brings the jobs back.
[00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:34.277]  And now what do we have?
[00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:35.958]  Ben Rhodes writes the new book and says,
[00:27:37.196 --> 00:27:45.103]  Obama tells Ben Rhodes in his new book after the election that Obama says, I've got the economy set up well for him.
[00:27:45.103 --> 00:27:48.666]  Now let me just explain this.
[00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:54.191]  So, Obama says that the jobs can't come back, the economy can't come back.
[00:27:55.532 --> 00:27:59.493]  Then Trump does it, and Obama takes credit for it.
[00:27:59.493 --> 00:28:04.914]  So first it couldn't happen, but then it does happen, and Obama takes credit for it.
[00:28:04.914 --> 00:28:08.495]  Now, deeper psychology tells you that's a communist leader.
[00:28:08.495 --> 00:28:09.936]  That's what they do.
[00:28:09.936 --> 00:28:16.557]  They steal all the wealth and then take credit for all of the degradation, claiming that that's what you wanted.
[00:28:16.557 --> 00:28:17.818]  Claiming that that's good for you.
[00:28:17.818 --> 00:28:18.698]  That's what Obama's doing here.
[00:28:19.378 --> 00:28:33.031]  So then he says, so Trump actually delivers, Trump actually does what Obama said was impossible, and then the communist psychology of an Obama, of a Hussein, is to take credit for that, like a good communist leader.
[00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:34.732]  So first he says it's not possible.
[00:28:35.473 --> 00:28:36.873]  Then he says he set it up well.
[00:28:36.873 --> 00:28:38.494]  But what's the irony?
[00:28:38.494 --> 00:28:41.594]  Is that President Hussein Obama did set it up perfectly.
[00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:42.435]  You know why?
[00:28:42.435 --> 00:28:44.875]  Because he put it on rock bottom.
[00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:52.577]  So President Obama did set up well Trump to save the economy because Trump left it with two knives in the back and an open wound in its neck.
[00:28:52.577 --> 00:28:57.358]  So Trump just, you know, put a patch on the wounds and fixed it and took the knife out.
[00:28:57.358 --> 00:28:58.258]  Now it's back to life!
[00:28:59.383 --> 00:29:01.984]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[00:33:16.482 --> 00:33:17.902]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:17.902 --> 00:33:25.244]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.244 --> 00:33:30.644]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:34.365]  You... You didn't build that business.
[00:33:34.365 --> 00:33:36.726]  You can't bring the jobs back.
[00:33:36.726 --> 00:33:39.486]  You can't save the economy.
[00:33:39.486 --> 00:33:40.246]  You didn't build that.
[00:33:40.246 --> 00:33:42.907]  You didn't raise that family.
[00:33:42.907 --> 00:33:44.667]  You didn't get that job.
[00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:45.027]  You didn't...
[00:33:46.069 --> 00:33:47.590]  Breathe that air?
[00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.192]  You didn't vote for that president?
[00:33:49.192 --> 00:33:51.494]  You didn't put your pants on this morning?
[00:33:51.494 --> 00:33:53.416]  You didn't eat breakfast?
[00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:56.519]  You didn't eat that cheeseburger?
[00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:58.361]  I did all that.
[00:33:58.361 --> 00:34:01.003]  I set you up to eat that cheeseburger.
[00:34:01.003 --> 00:34:03.626]  I set you up to build that business.
[00:34:03.626 --> 00:34:04.827]  I'm Barack Obama.
[00:34:04.827 --> 00:34:07.370]  I did everything.
[00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.614]  And I set Trump up, well, to fix this economy.
[00:34:12.841 --> 00:34:15.222]  Well, yeah, that's actually the most honest thing you've ever said.
[00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:17.844]  If you actually did say that.
[00:34:17.844 --> 00:34:21.886]  If you believe Ben Rhodes' new book.
[00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:24.127]  Oh, you're right.
[00:34:24.127 --> 00:34:32.232]  That's like saying, you know, I mean, I set that doctor up to save that man's life.
[00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:35.934]  Well, yeah, after you stabbed him in the neck.
[00:34:35.934 --> 00:34:38.496]  Yeah, well, how dare that doctor take credit?
[00:34:39.637 --> 00:34:42.138]  I set that doctor up to save his life!
[00:34:42.138 --> 00:34:44.860]  Don't you know I stabbed the doctor in the neck?
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.061]  And then the doctor's gonna take credit for saving his life when I set him up?
[00:34:48.061 --> 00:34:54.565]  That's basically what Obama's saying about the economy and Trump saving it.
[00:34:54.565 --> 00:34:55.665]  The perfect analogy.
[00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:59.948]  Well, you're gonna love this, folks.
[00:34:59.948 --> 00:35:05.410]  Alex Jones ran into Bernie Sanders at the LA International Airport.
[00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.092]  And my goodness, you can only imagine how that went.
[00:35:09.048 --> 00:35:13.971]  I haven't seen it yet myself, but I've heard about what went on.
[00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:26.779]  And let's just say, when Bernie Sanders found out that Alex Jones was at the airport, he ran the 40-yard dash faster than he ran it than he was on the track team in high school.
[00:35:29.414 --> 00:35:30.777]  He didn't run that track meet?
[00:35:30.777 --> 00:35:32.179]  Okay, no, I digress.
[00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:37.269]  So we're gonna have that video of Bernie Sanders being confronted by Alex Jones coming up soon.
[00:35:37.269 --> 00:35:38.752]  You're not gonna want to miss that.
[00:35:38.752 --> 00:35:40.816]  I'm even anxiously awaiting that myself.
[00:35:42.022 --> 00:35:45.384]  But look at some of these stories here.
[00:35:45.384 --> 00:35:51.547]  England's top family judge says society should welcome and applaud the decline of nuclear families.
[00:35:51.547 --> 00:36:02.873]  That's Sir James Murphy, the President of Family Division of the High Court of Justice for England and Wales, said society should welcome and applaud the collapse of traditional nuclear family life.
[00:36:02.873 --> 00:36:04.374]  Yes, and next they'll be telling you,
[00:36:05.294 --> 00:36:13.122]  You should welcome and applaud the cancer that is killing you and eating your lungs and your brain and your bones.
[00:36:13.122 --> 00:36:15.043]  That's what they'll say next, because that's the same thing.
[00:36:15.043 --> 00:36:20.449]  You know, destroy humanity by destroying the family, destroy the human by destroying the human body.
[00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:21.870]  It's really that simple.
[00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:22.671]  It's the same mindset.
[00:36:22.671 --> 00:36:24.753]  You can apply the same logic to anything.
[00:36:25.848 --> 00:36:37.757]  But that's just Sir James Munby, excuse me, Sir James Munby from the Family Division of High Court in England who says we should welcome and applaud the decline of the family.
[00:36:37.757 --> 00:36:41.520]  But, why not just bring it home?
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.324]  Kelmsford tells business to remove excessive American flags.
[00:36:48.649 --> 00:36:53.835]  This is in Massachusetts, a once great patriotic state.
[00:36:53.835 --> 00:37:00.383]  Now in Chelmsford, or Kelmsford, has said that a flag display has gone too far.
[00:37:00.383 --> 00:37:07.772]  200 flags were put in the office of John Crandell.
[00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.892]  Who works at Lair Realty in Kelmsford.
[00:37:12.892 --> 00:37:17.533]  They put 200 flags in the yard in support of the veterans.
[00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:27.357]  And they were told that that is a flag violation by... Where is this guy's name?
[00:37:27.357 --> 00:37:34.640]  Says that it is a violation of the flag policy, says Michael McCall.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.501]  So yeah, you know, just...
[00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.032]  Take down the American flags.
[00:37:38.032 --> 00:37:38.773]  We can't handle it.
[00:37:38.773 --> 00:37:41.436]  That's triggering some of the local population here.
[00:37:41.436 --> 00:37:43.199]  And let's actually just go to that report.
[00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:46.944]  Here's the local report on that from CBS 4 in Boston.
[00:37:47.779 --> 00:37:51.140]  You can see there are hundreds of flags at that property in Chelmsford.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.581]  Town officials say there are too many and nearly all of them have to go.
[00:37:54.581 --> 00:37:57.082]  Liam Martin joins us in studio now.
[00:37:57.082 --> 00:37:59.042]  And Liam, the order had the opposite effect.
[00:37:59.042 --> 00:38:00.143]  Well, Lisa, it certainly did.
[00:38:00.143 --> 00:38:02.683]  They started with about 200 flags for Memorial Day.
[00:38:02.683 --> 00:38:07.084]  And after receiving notice from the town that there were too many, they added another 300.
[00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:07.204]  Yeah!
[00:38:09.245 --> 00:38:17.010]  On Saturday we come out and we blind this with 200 flags in support of our deceased veterans and all the people that have served.
[00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.871]  But when John Crandall came to work today... Look at this patriotic man.
[00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:20.451]  How dare he?
[00:38:20.451 --> 00:38:21.872]  He found something.
[00:38:21.872 --> 00:38:28.196]  There was a note in the door from the building department stating that we had a violation, a flag violation.
[00:38:28.776 --> 00:38:29.957]  Excessive flags.
[00:38:29.957 --> 00:38:30.878]  Here's the note.
[00:38:30.878 --> 00:38:31.799]  The problem?
[00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:37.143]  There's a town bylaw that says you can't use flags for, quoting now, commercial promotion.
[00:38:37.143 --> 00:38:40.386]  Michael McCall is Chelmsford's assistant town manager.
[00:38:40.386 --> 00:38:43.349]  This is a commercial establishment located at a busy intersection.
[00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:45.070]  You can't have an American flag.
[00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.311]  I'm Michael McCall.
[00:38:46.311 --> 00:38:47.732]  I hate America and the Constitution.
[00:38:47.732 --> 00:38:49.093]  Take your flag down.
[00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:49.794]  It's my philosophy.
[00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:51.035]  You can't have a flag.
[00:38:51.035 --> 00:38:51.896]  It was a violation.
[00:38:52.136 --> 00:38:53.036]  It's a violation.
[00:38:53.036 --> 00:38:53.597]  I don't like flags.
[00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.617]  Just a reasonable amount of flags.
[00:38:54.617 --> 00:38:55.198]  One flag.
[00:38:55.198 --> 00:38:56.198]  I'd keep adding them.
[00:39:11.966 --> 00:39:13.727]  Yeah, I'd add 500 more.
[00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:17.208]  I don't think we need to get into a fight with City Hall.
[00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:19.569]  Now, this is the ironic thing about this.
[00:39:19.569 --> 00:39:23.690]  So, they say that you can't do that because of it's a commercial establishment or whatever.
[00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.371]  Well, it's just an American flag.
[00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:27.831]  He's not promoting any politician.
[00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:29.172]  He's not promoting anything.
[00:39:29.172 --> 00:39:33.233]  Just putting American flags in the lawn there.
[00:39:33.233 --> 00:39:35.894]  How is that a promotion of anything other than just America?
[00:39:35.894 --> 00:39:37.215]  Oh, but that's the problem.
[00:39:37.215 --> 00:39:38.395]  But see, this is what
[00:39:39.588 --> 00:39:49.332]  The left is having to come to terms with now where they thought it was popular to be anti-Trump, they thought it was popular to be anti-America, they thought that would sell.
[00:39:49.332 --> 00:39:51.613]  Now they're saying the exact opposite is the case.
[00:39:51.613 --> 00:39:54.815]  You come out for Trump, your ratings go up.
[00:39:54.815 --> 00:39:56.655]  Look who the top ratings on television are.
[00:39:56.655 --> 00:40:00.317]  Roseanne Barr and Tim Allen, both conservative shows that they call Trump supporters.
[00:40:01.246 --> 00:40:02.647]  They do the best!
[00:40:02.647 --> 00:40:07.489]  So yeah, putting American flags in your lawn would actually boost your business!
[00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:13.912]  And now the left is learning it, so they're saying, we'll take that flag down as we have a bylaw.
[00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:15.233]  Get the bylaws out.
[00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:16.833]  Is there a bylaw here?
[00:40:16.833 --> 00:40:19.975]  I need a... Where's the bylaws?
[00:40:19.975 --> 00:40:20.795]  I have a bylaw here.
[00:40:20.795 --> 00:40:21.816]  Does anyone have a bylaw?
[00:40:21.816 --> 00:40:25.237]  I gotta get these flags down.
[00:40:25.237 --> 00:40:25.718]  We got one!
[00:40:25.718 --> 00:40:26.418]  I got one right here!
[00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:27.639]  It's a bylaw!
[00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:29.059]  It can't be used for commercial property.
[00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.360]  Okay, we're gonna take it down, yeah.
[00:40:32.372 --> 00:40:34.013]  Hmm, okay.
[00:40:34.013 --> 00:40:37.534]  Oh, but is it, in case, you know what, you know what though?
[00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:47.359]  In case that wasn't anti-American enough for you, let's now go to a video report of a protester, this is just great, spitting on a police officer.
[00:40:48.353 --> 00:40:53.015]  That's a new reward in the hunt for a woman who spit on a Chicago police officer.
[00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:57.856]  That officer was spit on during a police union demonstration at City Hall last week.
[00:40:57.856 --> 00:41:01.418]  This video caught the woman approaching the officer and spitting on him.
[00:41:01.418 --> 00:41:04.759]  She was part of a group protesting against police.
[00:41:04.759 --> 00:41:10.841]  Now the Fraternal Order Police is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the woman's arrest.
[00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:14.953]  Well, she should have been arrested right there.
[00:41:14.953 --> 00:41:16.494]  You spit on someone, that's assault.
[00:41:16.494 --> 00:41:20.217]  But it's weird how these protesters get away with it every time.
[00:41:20.217 --> 00:41:23.439]  There was a protester that came up to us on Friday.
[00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:24.200]  I'm reporting.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.141]  Savannah Hernandez is shooting on the camera.
[00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:30.304]  This guy just comes up and just walks over and just right at her feet.
[00:41:30.304 --> 00:41:31.364]  Right at a woman's feet.
[00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:33.346]  Just walks over and spits at a woman's feet.
[00:41:34.818 --> 00:41:36.819]  Rude, disgusting behavior.
[00:41:36.819 --> 00:41:40.081]  We go to New York, myself, Harrison Smith, Daria, Kit Daniels.
[00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:41.201]  We're reporting from the scene.
[00:41:41.201 --> 00:41:42.102]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[00:41:42.102 --> 00:41:44.343]  Look at how quick this crew is.
[00:41:44.343 --> 00:41:49.606]  Yeah, this guy just walks over right in front of the female camera person and spits at her feet.
[00:41:49.606 --> 00:41:53.068]  A disgusting individual, a sick freak.
[00:41:53.068 --> 00:41:57.590]  And then you have this another one, spits at this police officer.
[00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:01.833]  So I get spat on, we get spat on, police officer gets spat on.
[00:42:01.833 --> 00:42:02.793]  That's assault.
[00:42:02.793 --> 00:42:04.274]  It never results in an arrest.
[00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.791]  Now, you want to see something pro-America?
[00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:11.392]  How about this report, guys?
[00:42:11.392 --> 00:42:13.014]  Roll what we can of Clip 5.
[00:42:13.014 --> 00:42:21.179]  Homeowner saves potentially his life and property with his AK-47.
[00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:29.305]  A homeowner who shot and killed two men showed me where the would-be burglars broke into his home Friday evening on Myrna Street in East Memphis.
[00:42:29.305 --> 00:42:35.309]  The man, who asked not to be identified for his safety, told me when he arrived home, the men were already inside.
[00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:39.633]  I see my house being, you know what I'm saying, like ramshackled.
[00:42:39.633 --> 00:42:42.316]  And dogs still going hysterically in the cage.
[00:42:42.316 --> 00:42:47.280]  So he comes home, he's got gunmen, armed robbers in his house that pull guns on him.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.224]  He goes and grabs his AK-47, saves his life, shoots him dead.
[00:42:51.224 --> 00:42:52.706]  That's why we have a Second Amendment.
[00:42:52.706 --> 00:42:54.648]  That's the protection the left doesn't want you to have.
[00:42:54.648 --> 00:42:56.369]  They would have said he can't have that AK-47.
[00:42:56.369 --> 00:42:57.891]  Saved his life that day.
[00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.912]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:02.912 --> 00:43:06.694]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.694 --> 00:43:12.956]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.956 --> 00:43:15.737]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.477 --> 00:43:20.279]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.279 --> 00:43:26.762]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.762 --> 00:43:31.725]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.475 --> 00:43:36.398]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.398 --> 00:43:43.602]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.602 --> 00:43:48.305]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.305 --> 00:43:54.509]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.509 --> 00:43:58.492]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.404]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[00:45:05.913 --> 00:45:06.553]  Thanks for calling.

[00:45:11.515 --> 00:45:24.599]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.

[00:45:36.446 --> 00:45:37.066]  Thank you, brother.

[00:45:45.651 --> 00:45:50.554]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:45:50.554 --> 00:45:53.376]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[00:45:53.596 --> 00:45:56.879]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there.

[00:46:56.861 --> 00:47:03.323]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:03.323 --> 00:47:05.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.328 --> 00:47:28.873]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:28.873 --> 00:47:31.014]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:33.295]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:33.295 --> 00:47:37.797]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:47:43.502 --> 00:47:59.822]  So we sent Harrison Smith out to cover the Tommy Robinson arrest and get some exclusive footage from London and from England but you know it's funny I'm talking to Harrison when he gets back they are over there
[00:48:00.805 --> 00:48:04.828]  have already pretty much accepted that they're in the 1984 dystopia.
[00:48:04.828 --> 00:48:28.648]  So they're like already in the 1984 dystopia, kind of living it out, where here in America, we're kind of like staring it down, and it's kind of pushing us around, but we're not quite totally in it yet, whereas in London, they're like already in that dystopian world, where a female reporter doesn't just get spit on, they literally just start fighting her and punching her.
[00:48:30.054 --> 00:48:32.196]  So, it's just incredible that here we are.
[00:48:32.196 --> 00:48:37.701]  And there's all kinds of clues that it's trying to bully us around and push us around.
[00:48:37.701 --> 00:48:45.388]  Like, for example, so you heard about the Supreme Court rules for Colorado Baker who wouldn't make same-sex wedding cake.
[00:48:46.641 --> 00:48:51.826]  But look at the spin that some media outlets will put on this.
[00:48:51.826 --> 00:49:01.555]  The USA Today says, Supreme Court rules on narrow grounds for Baker who refused to create same-sex couples wedding cake.
[00:49:01.555 --> 00:49:05.598]  Well, it was a 7-2 verdict.
[00:49:05.598 --> 00:49:07.200]  I'm not sure how 7-2 is narrow grounds.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:10.861]  But that's what they say.
[00:49:10.861 --> 00:49:11.662]  Narrow grounds.
[00:49:11.662 --> 00:49:14.144]  Like, we're almost there.
[00:49:14.144 --> 00:49:18.409]  We're almost there from stopping people from hating the gays.
[00:49:18.409 --> 00:49:21.913]  They still hate them here in America, but we're so close to stopping them.
[00:49:21.913 --> 00:49:22.814]  Narrow grounds.
[00:49:22.814 --> 00:49:23.895]  No, it was 7 to 2.
[00:49:23.895 --> 00:49:30.682]  And this has nothing to do with discrimination or a hate crime, in my opinion.
[00:49:30.682 --> 00:49:31.102]  Because...
[00:49:32.435 --> 00:49:33.956]  Let me just read from this.
[00:49:33.956 --> 00:49:35.217]  A divided Supreme Court.
[00:49:35.217 --> 00:49:35.738]  A divided.
[00:49:35.738 --> 00:49:36.558]  7-2.
[00:49:36.558 --> 00:49:38.339]  A divided Supreme Court.
[00:49:38.339 --> 00:49:40.461]  7-2 is like huge.
[00:49:40.461 --> 00:49:41.702]  You rarely get 7-2.
[00:49:41.702 --> 00:49:45.105]  When it's 7-2, that's like blowout.
[00:49:45.105 --> 00:49:49.168]  That's like 30 point victory in the NBA or something.
[00:49:49.168 --> 00:49:50.509]  A divided Supreme Court.
[00:49:50.509 --> 00:49:51.509]  A divided.
[00:49:51.509 --> 00:49:52.830]  A Supreme Court decision.
[00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:54.131]  Heavily favored in the decision.
[00:49:55.134 --> 00:50:08.739]  On Monday, absolved a Colorado baker of discrimination for refusing to create a custom wedding cake for same-sex couple, ruling that the state exhibited religious hostility against him.
[00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:15.622]  Look, this is what people need to understand fundamentally and philosophically about America.
[00:50:15.622 --> 00:50:18.523]  You have the right to discriminate.
[00:50:18.523 --> 00:50:19.943]  You do.
[00:50:19.943 --> 00:50:24.365]  But we have this thing called the free market that corrects it organically.
[00:50:26.863 --> 00:50:47.267]  Now, keep this in mind, while this gentleman was sitting in a court case, deciding whether or not he had to make that cake for the gay couple, all across the United States of America, campuses are hosting non-white events.
[00:50:47.267 --> 00:50:49.967]  Meaning, if you're white, you're not allowed.
[00:50:49.967 --> 00:50:51.948]  Supreme Court case?
[00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:52.268]  Nothing.
[00:50:54.025 --> 00:50:56.527]  But they'll say, narrow decision, 7-2.
[00:50:56.527 --> 00:51:04.733]  Yeah, the Golden State Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 120-80 last night in a narrow victory.
[00:51:04.733 --> 00:51:07.875]  40 point narrow victory, huh?
[00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:11.377]  That's what the USA Today's telling you.
[00:51:11.377 --> 00:51:21.665]  Meanwhile, what needs to be on the Supreme Court right now is, why is it that Google has its results popping up
[00:51:23.004 --> 00:51:26.448]  That say the Republicans are Nazis and Republicans are bigots.
[00:51:26.448 --> 00:51:28.370]  Is that AI?
[00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.872]  Is that Google's AI?
[00:51:29.872 --> 00:51:32.875]  Or is that individuals within Google responsible for that?
[00:51:32.875 --> 00:51:36.519]  Actually humans that are still working for Google.
[00:51:36.519 --> 00:51:39.923]  That should be on the Supreme Court today.
[00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:43.147]  And then we need to discuss what that means for the future of AI, which is just now.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.363]  Getting its cleats onto the turf.
[00:51:47.363 --> 00:51:50.326]  This should be in the Supreme Court or something.
[00:51:50.326 --> 00:51:51.387]  To me, this is like one of those things.
[00:51:51.387 --> 00:52:01.676]  It's like GMOs, like the 5G cell phone radiation, like huge implications for all of human history, huge implications for all of humanity, and we just don't even discuss it.
[00:52:01.676 --> 00:52:03.538]  We just don't even talk about it.
[00:52:03.538 --> 00:52:05.380]  But a gay wedding cake!
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.342]  Oh, it's the number one story!
[00:52:08.082 --> 00:52:09.683]  One gay wedding cake!
[00:52:09.683 --> 00:52:11.684]  Make a national case over it!
[00:52:11.684 --> 00:52:14.706]  The 5G blasting us all with cancer!
[00:52:14.706 --> 00:52:15.927]  You don't hear boo.
[00:52:15.927 --> 00:52:18.889]  The GMOs were the third stage testing in rats.
[00:52:18.889 --> 00:52:23.271]  They always had tumors and cancer and everything.
[00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:26.914]  Oh, we don't even worry about that though.
[00:52:26.914 --> 00:52:29.895]  No, it's all about a gay wedding cake.
[00:52:29.895 --> 00:52:30.416]  And then this.
[00:52:31.784 --> 00:52:37.408]  DNA for sale, Ancestry wants your spit, your DNA, and your trust, should you give them all three.
[00:52:37.408 --> 00:52:44.252]  You know, it's funny, I decided from now on, I'm just not making any claims about my Ancestry, period.
[00:52:44.252 --> 00:52:59.722]  So anytime the left wants to avert you saying like, oh you're not this, you're not that, you know what, I usually respond by saying, oh actually I'm this, or oh actually that, I'm just not going to do it anymore, because soon enough someone will challenge me to do one of these DNA tests, and hell no.
[00:52:59.722 --> 00:53:00.183]  Hell no.
[00:53:01.974 --> 00:53:16.587]  I'm actually lucky because I have certain members of my family, my lovely great aunt June, old uncle Larry, cousin Larry, that actually went out and did the research to look into my family history.
[00:53:16.587 --> 00:53:23.453]  So I don't need to just give my DNA over to some company and have who knows done with it.
[00:53:23.453 --> 00:53:24.774]  But people don't even think about that.
[00:53:24.774 --> 00:53:28.918]  So think about this DNA database that is essentially being formed now.
[00:53:30.523 --> 00:53:34.625]  With this new market for DNA testing, ancestry testing.
[00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:39.887]  Think about that like the Facebooks, which we're now learning, there's even new cases against Facebook now.
[00:53:39.887 --> 00:53:42.788]  I don't even know if I have the story in my stack of news.
[00:53:42.788 --> 00:53:48.590]  Facebook, we already told you, they're just, your data, everything on Facebook is for sale, baby.
[00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:51.971]  You don't have any privacy, and it just keeps coming out.
[00:53:51.971 --> 00:53:57.933]  Oh, and now they're finding out, hmm, wait a second, did Mark Zuckerberg lie when he was under testimony?
[00:53:57.933 --> 00:53:59.234]  Oh, but guess what?
[00:54:00.888 --> 00:54:03.891]  Oh, he didn't have to take the oath of honesty.
[00:54:03.891 --> 00:54:06.272]  Oh, how convenient!
[00:54:06.272 --> 00:54:11.437]  They didn't make him swear under oath!
[00:54:11.437 --> 00:54:14.539]  And then he lied.
[00:54:14.539 --> 00:54:20.384]  So you just want to give your data over to these social media megacorporations like Facebook and Google?
[00:54:20.384 --> 00:54:30.092]  Do you just want to give your DNA information over to what will soon be these ancestry megacorporations?
[00:54:30.092 --> 00:54:30.372]  I don't.
[00:54:32.586 --> 00:54:34.308]  I know I don't.
[00:54:34.308 --> 00:54:35.529]  But what do you get?
[00:54:35.529 --> 00:54:36.670]  What's the big story?
[00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.251]  What's the Supreme Court talking about?
[00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:39.832]  What is everybody talking about?
[00:54:39.832 --> 00:54:42.955]  A gay wedding cake.
[00:54:42.955 --> 00:54:45.878]  A non-story.
[00:54:45.878 --> 00:54:53.785]  Discrimination, it's my fundamental belief and philosophy of America that discrimination is legal here.
[00:54:53.785 --> 00:54:54.445]  And guess what?
[00:54:54.445 --> 00:54:57.788]  In the free market, it stomps it out!
[00:54:57.788 --> 00:54:58.509]  It's that simple!
[00:55:01.957 --> 00:55:04.199]  That's what makes America great!
[00:55:04.199 --> 00:55:05.880]  And you know what?
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:11.505]  That might create an environment for a lot of tomfoolery, and who knows, maybe even some racism.
[00:55:11.505 --> 00:55:12.806]  But guess what?
[00:55:12.806 --> 00:55:21.753]  This is the most free country on Earth, there's nothing else like it, there'll never be anything else like it, and it's the greatest thing ever.
[00:55:21.753 --> 00:55:23.295]  And the reason why it was created
[00:55:24.485 --> 00:55:29.208]  So that humans could have one last place to go to be free.
[00:55:29.208 --> 00:55:38.953]  That humans could have one last place to go that swore off against communism and swore off against socialism.
[00:55:38.953 --> 00:55:47.217]  So there would be one last place in this world to go and not have the government run your life.
[00:55:47.217 --> 00:55:49.919]  But then they'll tell you, you have to bake that gay cake.
[00:55:52.068 --> 00:55:53.009]  And then what do they say?
[00:55:53.009 --> 00:56:00.215]  This isn't America anymore.
[00:56:00.215 --> 00:56:03.838]  And that would have been what happens when you elect somebody like Bernie Sanders.
[00:56:03.838 --> 00:56:06.680]  But you go out now, they don't even hide it!
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.682]  Oh, what are your political beliefs?
[00:56:08.682 --> 00:56:10.023]  I'm a socialist!
[00:56:10.023 --> 00:56:11.164]  Oh, what are your political beliefs?
[00:56:11.164 --> 00:56:13.446]  I'm a communist!
[00:56:13.446 --> 00:56:17.089]  Wow, 40 years ago, that was almost an arrestable offense!
[00:56:19.144 --> 00:56:21.286]  Now you just scream it from the top of a mountain.
[00:56:21.286 --> 00:56:28.533]  And if you're asked, can you give me an example of socialism or communism that you would like to apply to the United States?
[00:56:28.533 --> 00:56:34.499]  One that you would deem a successful example?
[00:56:34.499 --> 00:56:36.440]  They got nothing.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.926]  But they all voted for Bernie Sanders, who it just so happens is at LA International
[00:56:43.314 --> 00:56:45.455]  And runs into Alex Jones.
[00:56:45.455 --> 00:56:47.236]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[00:56:47.236 --> 00:57:05.263]  Alex Jones runs into Ted Cruz on elevators, runs into the Turd Blossom at the Austin Airport, runs into Bernie Sanders at LA International, and we are going to debut that footage here on the Alex Jones Show, hopefully in the next hour, where I will be joined by Leo Zagami of leozagami.com.
[00:57:05.263 --> 00:57:10.385]  You're seeing all the news coming out of Italy about the populist uprising, the nationalist uprising.
[00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:11.826]  Leo Zagami is the expert.
[00:57:12.666 --> 00:57:14.187]  An insider on those movements.
[00:57:14.187 --> 00:57:15.908]  So we're going to get his opinion on that.
[00:57:15.908 --> 00:57:21.310]  On the other side, don't forget, of course, the Alex Jones confronts Bernie Sanders coming up as well.
[00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:24.992]  And it's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:57:49.285 --> 00:57:52.346]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[00:57:52.346 --> 00:57:56.929]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:57:56.929 --> 00:58:04.854]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:58:04.854 --> 00:58:07.936]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:58:08.556 --> 00:58:13.199]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:58:13.199 --> 00:58:17.342]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:58:17.342 --> 00:58:20.484]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:58:20.484 --> 00:58:25.247]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:58:25.247 --> 00:58:28.289]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:58:28.689 --> 00:58:43.783]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:58:43.783 --> 00:58:45.324]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:58:45.324 --> 00:58:47.466]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:58:50.336 --> 00:58:57.303]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[00:58:57.303 --> 00:58:59.805]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[00:58:59.805 --> 00:59:04.029]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge.
[00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:06.071]  And the world is taking notice.
[00:59:07.032 --> 00:59:21.037]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.

[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.709 --> 01:00:10.992]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[01:00:10.992 --> 01:00:13.574]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.574 --> 01:00:17.258]  You know... I got pretty angry, not surprised.
[01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:32.671]  And I think because there was a lack of surprise, the anger was a little bit subdued when I saw Bill Maher's segment attacking Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.492]  And I'm not going to sit here and defend Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.492 --> 01:00:37.493]  He did that coherently and successfully himself.
[01:00:37.493 --> 01:00:40.115]  And he, you know, he really doesn't need the defense.
[01:00:40.115 --> 01:00:43.516]  I mean, Bill Maher didn't cite or give any of the evidence, any of the claims he made.
[01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:47.578]  But there's one claim in there that particularly offends me.
[01:00:49.284 --> 01:00:57.593]  Now it's obviously insulting to an audience where you still have people saying that Obama didn't spy on Trump or that Trump wasn't being spied on.
[01:00:57.593 --> 01:00:58.934]  No, the FBI has admitted this.
[01:00:58.934 --> 01:01:01.697]  This is like saying grass isn't green.
[01:01:01.697 --> 01:01:03.319]  Okay?
[01:01:03.319 --> 01:01:08.864]  But when they use this attack on us at InfoWars and Alex Jones,
[01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:15.950]  Where they say, Alex Jones claims Hillary Clinton was selling children out of a pizza parlor.
[01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:17.952]  No, he never said that.
[01:01:17.952 --> 01:01:29.279]  I mean, even of the stuff that you could say that we reported on, not reporting it ourselves, but reporting on other people reporting on it, that was never even said.
[01:01:29.279 --> 01:01:33.963]  But they use Megyn Kelly to clip things together, they use Bill Maher to attack him.
[01:01:33.963 --> 01:01:38.366]  But here's why I take offense to this, and this is not me up here trying to defend Alex, it's that
[01:01:39.847 --> 01:01:42.609]  It's trying to defend the children.
[01:01:42.609 --> 01:01:46.130]  So I don't really care if Bill Maher wants to make fun of us.
[01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:50.753]  I don't really care if Megyn Kelly wants to clip things together to try to dehumanize us.
[01:01:50.753 --> 01:01:52.994]  We expect that.
[01:01:52.994 --> 01:02:04.581]  What angers me about this is how they make a joke out of it and then the general population thinks that child trafficking is some sort of a joke or that it doesn't go on.
[01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:06.722]  And all you have to do
[01:02:08.007 --> 01:02:24.057]  Is go into the WikiLeaks, the Podesta emails, and look at the emails where they talk about pizza maps, pizza parties, hot dog parties, Obama flying in pizza for $65,000 from Chicago.
[01:02:24.057 --> 01:02:31.622]  You look at the spirit cookings, you look at the Podesta art, you look at Laura Sillsby, you look at all these connections.
[01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:41.747]  And then they focus on the pizza parlor in DC that all the Democrats meet at, where there's some weird meat on that bone.
[01:02:41.747 --> 01:02:46.373]  And then other people report on it, and they somehow say that that's our narrative.
[01:02:46.373 --> 01:02:51.879]  But just to show you why I get so offended by this, let's go to clip 8.
[01:02:53.351 --> 01:02:59.536]  Underground bunker, possibly used for human trafficking, found by a Veterans Awareness Group.
[01:02:59.536 --> 01:03:05.781]  Craig Sawyer, a good friend of the show, one of the veterans behind that, look at what they discovered in Clip 8.
[01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:10.445]  I mean, just to the right of these trees, just on the left side of this fence, that's where this thing is.
[01:03:11.283 --> 01:03:12.444]  This is a prison cell.
[01:03:12.444 --> 01:03:14.305]  Only kids are being held down here.
[01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:19.669]  And they brought me into the camp and showed me the underground bunker.
[01:03:19.669 --> 01:03:26.914]  It was basically a giant plastic container with a hole only small enough for a child to crawl in and out of.
[01:03:26.914 --> 01:03:33.759]  And it was angled in such a way, and it was buried underground, that a small child that was in there could not have gotten out on their own.
[01:03:33.759 --> 01:03:34.979]  They're having them slide up.
[01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:36.280]  Here's a child's vanity.
[01:03:38.442 --> 01:03:42.044]  And a hospital toilet.
[01:03:42.044 --> 01:03:45.085]  That looks like a child's car seat.
[01:03:45.085 --> 01:03:50.329]  Strollers and children's toys and clothing and food packets and stuff like that.
[01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:52.610]  So clearly children had been kept here.
[01:03:53.130 --> 01:04:06.537]  Alright, so with these straps... One thing that was really disturbing was there were arm restraints, wrist restraints on two trees angled like this to where friends of mine that are investigators that do a lot of stuff on the border say, Craig, that's a rape tree.
[01:04:06.537 --> 01:04:09.379]  That looks exactly like wrist restraints for a rape tree.
[01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:10.679]  It doesn't look like anything else.
[01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:14.421]  This is clearly a disturbing and wrongful thing going on.
[01:04:14.421 --> 01:04:15.802]  It's inhumane.
[01:04:15.802 --> 01:04:19.364]  It's shocking and upsetting to any decent adult.
[01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:32.843]  You know, I had Craig send me some exclusive footage that he shot on his cell phone of that, and that's why I take it so offensive when they try to make a huge joke out of people reporting on child sex trafficking.
[01:04:32.843 --> 01:04:44.614]  You know, Bill, you can make fun of Alex Jones all you want, but when you make a joke out of child sex trafficking, which is very real and protected by governments and elites, you're keeping those children enslaved.
[01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:49.900]  So just keep that in mind the next time you want to make fun of us reporting on child sex trafficking.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.605]  There are actual dungeons and rape trees underground where children are trafficked.
[01:04:53.605 --> 01:04:54.987]  So that's no joke to me.
[01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:08.011]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.

[01:05:55.415 --> 01:06:05.960]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.643]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:06:10.643 --> 01:06:14.644]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:14.644 --> 01:06:17.486]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:21.457 --> 01:06:25.260]  Alright, my guest is Leo Zagami, leozagami.com.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:41.971]  Now, Leo, obviously there is a lot of big developments happening in Italy right now, and you know, you've been reporting on this, you've been seeing this coming for a while, and we've always wondered, will the populist momentum, will the nationalist momentum come to fruition?
[01:06:41.971 --> 01:06:49.537]  You've known, you've had all these hurdles in front of you to leap, but George Soros, being one of those hurdles, is now starting to panic.
[01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:55.752]  And it looks like the reality is setting into him that Italy wants out of the EU.
[01:06:55.752 --> 01:07:10.164]  And so now they're kind of debating a new tactic here, it seems like to me, Leo, where maybe they kind of do a thing where they let Italy think it's getting out of the EU, but just keep it in kind of like a Brexit deal in order to keep the populace at bay.
[01:07:10.164 --> 01:07:12.386]  But you're the expert from leozegami.com.
[01:07:12.386 --> 01:07:14.849]  Leo Zegami, what is the story today?
[01:07:14.849 --> 01:07:17.251]  What is the latest on the populist uprising in Italy?
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.041]  Well, hello Owen, and hello to our viewers and listeners.
[01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:47.650]  I would say that the main thing is the visit of George Soros in Italy, which I found profoundly disturbing, as also this visit has been made on money given by the taxpayers, because he participated to the economic festival in Trento, which has taken money financed by the state.
[01:07:48.456 --> 01:08:10.090]  It's a very left-wing kind of course of organization involved with this whole thing, but George Soros took advantage of his speech on the 2nd of June given to a packed audience inside the place, but the actual screen where it was projected outside for the festival, I have even a picture of it, was completely empty.
[01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:17.316]  Because, of course, all the people who wanted to see Soros wanted to be there without being seen themselves.
[01:08:17.316 --> 01:08:25.042]  And he said some very heavy things, some very heavy accusations, especially against Donald J. Trump.
[01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:30.166]  He said that Trump is basically a threat to the economy.
[01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:33.509]  He doesn't understand the basic elements of economy.
[01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:41.415]  How is it possible he makes these statements when he was a supporter of Obama who made a disaster of the US economy?
[01:08:41.415 --> 01:08:56.287]  And at the same time, he attacked the new coalition in Italy, defining them of course as a threat, but also focusing on Matteo Salvini, accusing him of possibly having taken money from Russia.
[01:08:56.827 --> 01:09:13.344]  Now, from the inside, because as you know I have also been involved in politics here in Italy, I know that for sure Matteo Salvini and the Nordic League didn't take any money from Russia because Russia simply didn't give them any money.
[01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:18.192]  They gave them the possibility of a collaboration, of course.
[01:09:18.192 --> 01:09:19.393]  They are in very good terms.
[01:09:19.393 --> 01:09:32.621]  And in fact, Matteo Salvini, who is the new Minister of Interior, was promised in the last few days that he would deport 500,000 immigrants from Italy, creating, of course, chaos in the EU.
[01:09:32.621 --> 01:09:34.783]  And George Soros had to intervene directly.
[01:09:34.783 --> 01:09:41.307]  He arrived there at the festival and said, before arriving at the festival, in an article for the Corriere della Sera,
[01:09:41.967 --> 01:09:56.696]  Warned Italy of being in this position and also warned the EU of having given Italy the possibility with their actions of electing the Northern League and the Five Star Movement.
[01:09:56.696 --> 01:09:59.577]  Basically, George Soros is not stupid.
[01:09:59.577 --> 01:10:10.784]  He said that if the EU continues in this undiplomatic way with the accusations that we talked about from the various German politicians and the EU Commission and so on,
[01:10:11.304 --> 01:10:16.968]  Well, they will actually probably win with an even larger majority the next time.
[01:10:16.968 --> 01:10:21.130]  But of course, George Soros is not a friend of Italy.
[01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:25.092]  He's a friend of the Democratic Party in Italy.
[01:10:25.092 --> 01:10:33.958]  And in fact, he has used this, let's say, this possibility for him to talk to the Italian audience.
[01:10:34.498 --> 01:10:45.103]  So they're using the same tactic there with the whole Russia angle to try to stop this nationalist movement.
[01:10:57.268 --> 01:11:09.883]  But again, you see some of the reservation on George Soros where he realizes now that this movement is real and it's enough to probably get Italy out of the EU if by way of vote, if it came to that.
[01:11:09.883 --> 01:11:11.906]  So it sounds to me like he's kind of trying to...
[01:11:12.927 --> 01:11:36.978]  Pander to this to have a false sense of security that oh, yeah, Italy maybe you can get out of the EU Just like the brexit vote like yeah, we'll give you your vote You're still in the EU you voted to be out of it, but you're still in it And we gave you the vote so you know quit complaining and so maybe they do something like that, but overall I mean It's just amazing that George Soros will go in front of Italy and say that Trump is a threat to the economy When he's the damn threat
[01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:38.699]  He knows he's a threat.
[01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:40.781]  He's the one that bet on the EU.
[01:11:40.781 --> 01:11:44.423]  If Italy has a sovereign nation, he's the one that loses.
[01:11:44.423 --> 01:11:49.607]  There's another important news that I got in the last few hours.
[01:11:49.607 --> 01:12:00.235]  There was a strong criticism of Soros' presence with taxpayer money in that region from the Italian Association, the Israeli-Italian Association.
[01:12:00.974 --> 01:12:12.237]  Alexander Bertoldi, who is the official spokesman for the Israel-Italian Association, basically confirmed what Alex Jones and you have always said, that Soros is a Nazi!
[01:12:12.237 --> 01:12:22.640]  The Israeli associations in Italy say that he's a dangerous guy, he's already been kicked out of Austria, he's been kicked out of Hungary a couple of days ago, he closed down also his office.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.101]  His home country doesn't even want him!
[01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:26.722]  Sorry?
[01:12:26.722 --> 01:12:28.162]  His home country doesn't even want him!
[01:12:29.233 --> 01:12:41.486]  Well, his own country doesn't want him, but he moved to Berlin to be close to Angela Merkel so, you know, they can be... Yes, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the Nazis come back together!
[01:12:42.711 --> 01:12:43.692]  Absolutely.
[01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:50.295]  I mean, the Open Society moving the headquarters in Europe to Berlin is very ominous of a Nazi takeover.
[01:12:50.295 --> 01:13:08.585]  And the crazy thing is this Parliament is just coming together in the next couple of days, this new government in Italy, but of course we had the worst attacks on it already from the Democratic Party in Italy accusing them of being fascist and so on.
[01:13:09.045 --> 01:13:18.189]  But Matteo Salvini went down to Sicily and said very clearly, Sicily can't become the refugee camp of Europe.
[01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:22.711]  I mean, come on guys, you can't make Sicily the refugee camp of Europe.
[01:13:22.711 --> 01:13:26.393]  It's completely impossible to tolerate for Sicilians.
[01:13:26.893 --> 01:13:31.740]  And I think that everybody knows that Sicilians can get very dangerous at times.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:36.025]  So I think that Giorgos Soros should really leave Italy.
[01:13:36.025 --> 01:13:41.933]  Matteo Salvini in the last few hours also added fuel to the fire, as you say.
[01:13:42.373 --> 01:13:49.439]  And he said that soon George Soros will not be made welcome anymore in Italy.
[01:13:49.439 --> 01:13:52.802]  It will not be possible for Soros to come in Italy again.
[01:13:52.802 --> 01:14:02.611]  Because he will, of course, have argued with one of the most key figures, the Interior Ministry, who is also the head of the police in Italy, by the way.
[01:14:02.611 --> 01:14:04.833]  So to have an argument with the head of
[01:14:05.854 --> 01:14:10.358]  What is the driving force of Italian society at this moment?
[01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:11.680]  Keeping the security in Italy?
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.441]  I mean, it's not a good idea.
[01:14:13.441 --> 01:14:23.091]  Any case, the fact that they want to connect Salvini with Putin is typical like they did with Trump and Russia.
[01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.554]  So the techniques are exactly the same.
[01:14:26.034 --> 01:14:29.356]  It's just like something we have seen over and over again.
[01:14:29.356 --> 01:14:40.383]  The Liberals going crazy, the media in Italy can't just take and let them work, can't take the situation and they seem to be panicking, all of them.
[01:14:40.383 --> 01:14:47.108]  So I think it's a very interesting situation and like you said, maybe they will give Italy the illusion
[01:14:47.948 --> 01:14:50.970]  of getting rid of Europe.
[01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:58.294]  But like Nigel Farage said recently, this is only the beginning of Italy's rebellion.
[01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:05.018]  I mean, Italy's nationalism runs very deep as well, of course, as their fascist roots.
[01:15:05.018 --> 01:15:06.939]  We don't want to go back to fascism.
[01:15:06.939 --> 01:15:11.082]  Of course, we are totally against what Mussolini did with the racial laws.
[01:15:11.082 --> 01:15:14.344]  But I tell you, Italy is not a country that will
[01:15:14.824 --> 01:15:19.108]  Hold your thought right there because we got to go to break here.
[01:15:19.108 --> 01:15:21.310]  So we'll pick it back up there on the other side of this break.
[01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:26.354]  But I think it's good news because to me it shows that Soros is weakening.
[01:15:42.688 --> 01:15:53.261]  And he knows he's weakening, and so he's kind of like, alright, I gotta back off in Italy here, or this could be a death blow to my Nazi, EU, headquartered in Berlin regime.
[01:15:53.261 --> 01:15:56.105]  I mean, this is, with Jean-Claude Juncker in charge.

[01:20:16.497 --> 01:20:24.101]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:24.101 --> 01:20:33.365]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.365 --> 01:20:34.646]  So... How do you cover this?
[01:20:34.646 --> 01:20:36.107]  Okay.
[01:20:36.107 --> 01:20:37.688]  So you've got George Soros.
[01:20:39.716 --> 01:20:55.532]  A Hungarian-born Jew who goes on 60 Minutes and tells his story about being a young man during the Nazi regime, saying it was the best time of his life, that's what built his character, betraying his fellow Jews, rounding up his fellow Jews, stealing their property.
[01:20:55.532 --> 01:20:56.353]  He loved it.
[01:20:57.955 --> 01:21:07.903]  Then you've got Jean-Claude Juncker, the offspring of another Nazi sympathizer who worked for Hitler, whose father-in-law was also a Nazi sympathizer.
[01:21:07.903 --> 01:21:11.826]  And you've got these two basically running the EU.
[01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:14.248]  George Soros and Jean-Claude Juncker.
[01:21:14.248 --> 01:21:14.849]  There they are.
[01:21:14.849 --> 01:21:19.152]  Both not, you could say, I mean, they want to cry Nazi all day long.
[01:21:19.152 --> 01:21:21.374]  There's your dang Nazis.
[01:21:21.374 --> 01:21:22.054]  Right there.
[01:21:22.054 --> 01:21:23.716]  If anyone's a Nazi, it's those two.
[01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:32.112]  And by the way, the original plans for the Nazi regime was essentially what the EU is today.
[01:21:32.112 --> 01:21:35.973]  How ironic, it's still based out of Berlin.
[01:21:35.973 --> 01:21:38.374]  I mean, it's like they're doing this right in front of you.
[01:21:38.374 --> 01:21:43.396]  And then they point the finger at conservatives and nationalists and say, you're a Nazi.
[01:21:43.396 --> 01:21:51.819]  And then Google, whether it's individuals at Google or their AI, now say that Republicans are Nazis.
[01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:52.319]  And it's like,
[01:21:54.198 --> 01:21:57.980]  George Soros and Jean-Claude Juncker, though, don't even exist.
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.843]  You know, you search them, you're not going to find their Nazi ties.
[01:22:01.843 --> 01:22:03.284]  Not front page.
[01:22:03.284 --> 01:22:04.905]  Not right there.
[01:22:04.905 --> 01:22:11.209]  And, Leo, this is like the overarching agenda behind the EU.
[01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:14.271]  It's about centralized power.
[01:22:14.271 --> 01:22:22.756]  And Soros has bet with all his hedge funds and all his billions of dollars on the EU
[01:22:23.991 --> 01:22:31.316]  Coming to fruition for full power and now it's collapsing and he realizes it and so he's panicking.
[01:22:31.316 --> 01:22:44.386]  And then you've got in Italy now where there's this mass migration problem all across Europe but Italy is finally saying with enough consensus, we've had enough and its leaders are doing something about it.
[01:22:44.386 --> 01:22:52.652]  So now here we are, Leo, break it all down with what has led to this moment and what comes next in Italy with this populist and nationalist uprising.
[01:22:54.574 --> 01:23:12.683]  Well, yesterday, as I said earlier, Salvini, the new interior minister, was in Sicily, and immediately now there is a diplomatic confrontation with Tunisia, because he has basically said to Tunisia, you can't keep on sending all your
[01:23:13.263 --> 01:23:17.266]  Did you just say there's a boat arriving in the islands of Sardinia?
[01:23:41.482 --> 01:23:46.769]  Yeah, there was a boat of immigrants who arrived and stole in a restaurant.
[01:23:46.769 --> 01:23:48.311]  They broke into a restaurant.
[01:23:48.311 --> 01:23:52.577]  They stole over a thousand euro food and money.
[01:23:52.577 --> 01:23:56.822]  Fortunately, the Carabinieri, the police, arrived and they got arrested.
[01:23:56.822 --> 01:23:58.484]  The Sardinians aren't gonna put up with that!
[01:23:59.758 --> 01:24:03.840]  No, they're very, actually, they're even worse than the Sicilians.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:10.603]  They use this knife to cut the ball, which is made like this, and you put it under and you cut them open.
[01:24:10.603 --> 01:24:15.265]  So I think it's not a good idea to get the Sardinians angry.
[01:24:15.265 --> 01:24:25.710]  In any case, as I said, the fact that Soros used this trip to Italy to criticize Trump and also give
[01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:34.840]  An ominous prophecy saying that Trump's political stand is going to end after the midterm elections.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:42.508]  Now, I will invite Trump and his supporters to keep an eye on Soros because this guy is working around some kind of plan.
[01:24:42.988 --> 01:24:44.509]  For the midterm elections.
[01:24:44.509 --> 01:24:48.511]  And after that he wants to see Trump totally out of the picture.
[01:24:48.511 --> 01:24:50.672]  Because Trump is his main enemy.
[01:24:50.672 --> 01:25:00.796]  So we need to really make George Soros aware that we are on his case, that we are not going to take this anymore, neither in Europe or in the US.
[01:25:00.796 --> 01:25:07.359]  And here in Italy is now an open war between the terror minister and George Soros.
[01:25:07.819 --> 01:25:21.947]  Who in any case is still considered a very important ally by the President of Italy, Mattarella, who received him in private last year together with ex-Prime Minister Gentiloni.
[01:25:23.067 --> 01:25:32.491]  We have a very, very delicate situation now with the new government that, of course, has been sustained by all the people.
[01:25:32.491 --> 01:25:37.974]  On the 2nd of June, if you go on the Internet, you will find this incredible military parade made in Rome.
[01:25:38.454 --> 01:25:42.578]  And finally, the soldiers were proud of their government.
[01:25:42.578 --> 01:25:52.266]  Last year, the communists were in power, this day in this event, and even made faces during the parade.
[01:25:52.266 --> 01:25:58.531]  So just like how Trump has returned American pride and nationalism to America, you're seeing that in Italy happening right now.
[01:25:59.793 --> 01:26:07.834]  Yes, the new Prime Minister Conte, we want the respect... I'm sorry, Leo, I just want to pause you right there and we're going to continue to get updates from you on that situation.
[01:26:07.834 --> 01:26:12.195]  But I just want to go for the final two minutes here in a different direction, if you don't mind.
[01:26:12.195 --> 01:26:13.675]  Sure.
[01:26:13.675 --> 01:26:28.738]  And I want to go here with you because I know that you know a lot of this stuff behind the scenes, Illuminati, secret societies, where this weekend I decided to just go back down the rabbit hole away from politics into the secret history and the secret stuff.
[01:26:29.321 --> 01:26:31.142]  Now, there is a story that went viral today.
[01:26:31.142 --> 01:26:34.662]  A major physics experiment just detected a particle that shouldn't exist.
[01:26:34.662 --> 01:26:35.763]  Well, okay.
[01:26:35.763 --> 01:26:41.264]  It shouldn't exist based on mainstream science and mainstream physics, right.
[01:26:41.264 --> 01:26:51.007]  But this is like what they're gonna say, because I think right now, Leo, we're on the verge of a major breakthrough when it comes to human history.
[01:26:51.007 --> 01:26:51.187]  Now,
[01:26:53.956 --> 01:27:06.941]  The reason why I was shocked at the island of Sardinia, many people probably don't realize the secret human history that is on the island of Sardinia and how the Catholic Church has been working to bury a lot of that secret history.
[01:27:06.941 --> 01:27:16.165]  So just in the final minute and a half here, Leo Zagami, leozagami.com, do you think we're on the verge of getting a lot of the secret history of humans out there?
[01:27:16.165 --> 01:27:21.748]  Do you think a lot of the mysteries of the universe are finally going to come to the general population's understanding and knowledge?
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:33.328]  Well, of course, they are moving towards merging with artificial intelligence, which means an immense amount of knowledge, all together and for everybody.
[01:27:33.328 --> 01:27:35.790]  At that point, though, they will have to control such knowledge.
[01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:47.980]  And at the same time, the Chern Laboratories in Switzerland are working to break into what is the mysteries of, the ultimate mysteries of quantum physics, to enter other dimensions.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:28:07.477]  And possibly, of course, doing damage by doing this kind of experiments because they might even be very dangerous for humanity to open those dimensions, which of course also are linked with esoterism, with the use and the vocations of certain entities.
[01:28:07.477 --> 01:28:14.683]  There was that ritual that went on mysteriously in front of the Chern Laboratories that nobody ever really gave us
[01:28:15.203 --> 01:28:17.204]  A serious explanation of what went on.
[01:28:17.204 --> 01:28:22.228]  I mean, there is a video of somebody stabbing a woman.
[01:28:22.228 --> 01:28:23.609]  There is these people in capes.
[01:28:45.163 --> 01:28:49.134]  On the other side, I'll try to get to more of this news.
[01:28:49.134 --> 01:28:51.420]  It just keeps coming, the craziness, folks.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.222]  It just keeps coming.
[01:28:57.455 --> 01:29:00.497]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:29:00.497 --> 01:29:04.480]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.740]  The Bug-A-Salt.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:10.684]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.

[01:29:30.376 --> 01:29:38.522]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:29:58.311 --> 01:30:05.937]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:30:05.937 --> 01:30:13.863]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:30:13.863 --> 01:30:16.946]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:30:17.566 --> 01:30:22.229]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:26.352]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:30:26.352 --> 01:30:29.494]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:30:29.494 --> 01:30:34.257]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:30:34.257 --> 01:30:37.299]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:30:37.719 --> 01:30:52.817]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:30:52.817 --> 01:30:54.338]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.338 --> 01:30:56.541]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:58.376 --> 01:31:03.958]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in Fuller's life.
[01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:04.838]  It'd take hours.
[01:31:04.838 --> 01:31:07.259]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:31:07.259 --> 01:31:08.439]  It's stronger.
[01:31:08.439 --> 01:31:10.060]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:13.281]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:31:13.281 --> 01:31:14.401]  It's back in stock.
[01:31:14.401 --> 01:31:17.582]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:31:17.582 --> 01:31:21.343]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:31:21.343 --> 01:31:24.464]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:31:24.464 --> 01:31:25.344]  So you can upload it.
[01:31:25.344 --> 01:31:26.785]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[01:31:27.385 --> 01:31:34.490]  The Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:35.450]  That's a spray you do.
[01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:36.751]  You can also swallow it.
[01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:42.075]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:31:42.075 --> 01:31:43.476]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:31:43.476 --> 01:31:53.402]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:31:53.402 --> 01:31:56.444]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:31:57.870 --> 01:32:08.483]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.483 --> 01:32:10.545]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.545 --> 01:32:13.408]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.408 --> 01:32:14.890]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:18.034]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:18.254 --> 01:32:21.697]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.697 --> 01:32:23.778]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:23.778 --> 01:32:33.506]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:46.015]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:32:46.015 --> 01:32:47.376]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:20.060]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:29.144]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:29.144 --> 01:33:35.748]  You know, we really don't go too deep into the rabbit hole here at InfoWars.
[01:33:35.748 --> 01:33:46.333]  We try to stick to certain political issues, current issues, and not get too into the paranormal or the secret history.
[01:33:47.776 --> 01:33:49.197]  Hey guys, could you pull that down?
[01:33:49.197 --> 01:33:51.097]  Actually, sorry, that's kind of just distracting me.
[01:33:51.097 --> 01:33:54.219]  The crew just put news reports going on on the screen.
[01:33:54.219 --> 01:33:57.160]  If you think it's something I need to see, just print out the story for me.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:13.207]  But, if I look kind of tired today, this weekend I just went deep down the rabbit hole of secret history and the origins of humanity that they don't talk about.
[01:34:14.673 --> 01:34:18.755]  The mysteries of the universe that they don't highlight.
[01:34:18.755 --> 01:34:25.958]  And it's funny because there was a moment in time over the weekend where I was watching something.
[01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:31.421]  It's honestly, it's so complex.
[01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:32.661]  It's so complicated.
[01:34:32.661 --> 01:34:38.784]  It's like NASA.
[01:34:38.784 --> 01:34:42.485]  It's like, what do you get into when you want to talk about NASA?
[01:34:42.485 --> 01:34:43.326]  You want to talk about
[01:34:44.642 --> 01:34:50.406]  All the fakes NASA's put out.
[01:34:50.406 --> 01:34:54.308]  Many of which that they admit now.
[01:34:54.308 --> 01:35:10.198]  And it's funny because I was watching a documentary and it had Stanley Kubrick talking about his most famous film ever that nobody knows he did it.
[01:35:12.247 --> 01:35:31.966]  And then, of course, right after that, I was listening to Alex Jones' special report from over the weekend, where he was talking about getting information off-record from Stanley Kubrick and his family about his most popular film ever that nobody knows he shot.
[01:35:31.966 --> 01:35:36.850]  But it's like, that's just one angle of secret modern history.
[01:35:37.833 --> 01:35:45.395]  That doesn't even get into the secrets of the ancient pyramids, the secrets of the megaliths.
[01:35:45.395 --> 01:35:48.856]  But it's all out there.
[01:35:48.856 --> 01:35:58.938]  And we sit here and we obsess over race, we obsess over a gay cake, and it's just a joke.
[01:35:58.938 --> 01:36:02.439]  It's all just a joke, when it really comes down to it.
[01:36:06.656 --> 01:36:07.637]  Secret energy.
[01:36:07.637 --> 01:36:16.101]  I mean, you can't even believe the stuff that humanity has been denied.
[01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:22.284]  I don't know if Trump's going to reveal it all, but he's certainly moving that direction.
[01:36:22.284 --> 01:36:25.825]  He said so in his inaugural speech.
[01:36:25.825 --> 01:36:26.726]  Does Trump deliver?
[01:36:26.726 --> 01:36:34.970]  Oh, and then there's these crazy connections with Trump and Tesla and then Trump's gold apartment.
[01:36:36.496 --> 01:36:39.418]  I mean, but I'm already going off the ledge.
[01:36:39.418 --> 01:36:52.746]  This is just like, but you come back down to Earth, which is where they want us, and you deal with the muck.
[01:36:52.746 --> 01:36:56.609]  Look at what's going on in California right now.
[01:36:56.609 --> 01:36:58.410]  Okay, so who runs California?
[01:36:58.410 --> 01:37:00.491]  Well, the Democrats run California.
[01:37:00.491 --> 01:37:05.895]  Proud Democrat state, the liberal bastion in America is California.
[01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:15.684]  Bay Area poll, 46% of residents want to leave.
[01:37:15.684 --> 01:37:17.585]  Well, there's all kinds of reasons for that.
[01:37:17.585 --> 01:37:21.846]  You got feces on the streets.
[01:37:21.846 --> 01:37:26.368]  You've got rampant violence on the streets.
[01:37:26.368 --> 01:37:32.731]  You've got rampant homelessness on the streets, run by Democrats.
[01:37:32.731 --> 01:37:36.273]  But what is the solution?
[01:37:38.683 --> 01:37:41.144]  Well, they're going to start giving them money.
[01:37:41.144 --> 01:37:45.805]  California City fights poverty with guaranteed income.
[01:37:45.805 --> 01:37:47.706]  Sounds good.
[01:37:47.706 --> 01:37:49.946]  Sounds like it might work.
[01:37:49.946 --> 01:37:55.448]  But keep that story up, guys, because it all comes back to that.
[01:37:55.448 --> 01:37:57.088]  Look at what California has done in history.
[01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:58.669]  The Clean Needle Program.
[01:37:58.669 --> 01:38:01.549]  Now there's needles all over the streets.
[01:38:01.549 --> 01:38:04.310]  Now there's more drug use, more homelessness.
[01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:06.231]  They thought the Clean Needle Program would work.
[01:38:06.231 --> 01:38:06.751]  It backfired.
[01:38:09.568 --> 01:38:12.391]  More STDs!
[01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:15.754]  You can point to the Clean Needle program perhaps for that.
[01:38:15.754 --> 01:38:17.295]  But you don't even have to!
[01:38:17.295 --> 01:38:25.523]  The California government says you can now knowingly spread HIV and it's not a crime.
[01:38:25.523 --> 01:38:31.909]  STDs skyrocket in California and their politicians are scratching their heads like, what?
[01:38:31.909 --> 01:38:32.929]  How is this going on?
[01:38:34.318 --> 01:38:36.939]  And then they're all moving out of California.
[01:38:36.939 --> 01:38:38.220]  They can't afford it.
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:42.042]  They're sick of walking down the street and having to smell human feces.
[01:38:42.042 --> 01:38:49.146]  They're sick of walking down the street having to see a bum do his business in the streets.
[01:38:49.146 --> 01:38:52.488]  They're sick of being taxed to nothingness.
[01:38:52.488 --> 01:38:58.912]  They're sick of not being able to afford the rent, except in an area where there's a feces-ridden street.
[01:39:01.072 --> 01:39:02.153]  And so what does California say?
[01:39:02.153 --> 01:39:03.313]  Well, we'll just give people money.
[01:39:03.313 --> 01:39:04.294]  That'll solve the problem.
[01:39:04.294 --> 01:39:06.335]  We'll just give them needles.
[01:39:06.335 --> 01:39:07.616]  That'll solve the problem.
[01:39:07.616 --> 01:39:08.537]  Oh, and then what happens?
[01:39:08.537 --> 01:39:09.758]  Drug use, up.
[01:39:09.758 --> 01:39:10.858]  STD, up.
[01:39:10.858 --> 01:39:12.439]  Poverty, up.
[01:39:12.439 --> 01:39:23.607]  Meanwhile, they want to bring in more people!
[01:39:23.607 --> 01:39:28.850]  So that's just one set of stories.
[01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:29.551]  How about this, though?
[01:39:30.424 --> 01:39:40.766]  You know, you have to say, Bill Clinton is finally catching some flack for all the philandering he did when he was president.
[01:39:40.766 --> 01:39:43.867]  Well, maybe not all of it, but at least with Monica Lewinsky.
[01:39:43.867 --> 01:39:50.568]  Now, I actually will give Bill Clinton a little credit, because he's kind of standing up to the plate and saying, yeah, I don't regret what I did with Monica.
[01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:51.689]  You know, it was consensual.
[01:39:51.689 --> 01:39:52.609]  We had a good time.
[01:39:52.609 --> 01:39:56.430]  You know, me too movement, who cares?
[01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:57.610]  So there's old Billy boy.
[01:39:59.861 --> 01:40:04.224]  He was just kind of like, yeah, yeah, I did have sexual relations with that woman.
[01:40:04.224 --> 01:40:05.925]  And I kind of liked it.
[01:40:05.925 --> 01:40:08.786]  And I think I'd do it again.
[01:40:08.786 --> 01:40:10.747]  You see what my wife looks like?
[01:40:10.747 --> 01:40:14.570]  You're telling me you wouldn't search for something else?
[01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:17.892]  Have you seen that woman?
[01:40:17.892 --> 01:40:22.114]  You're telling me if you were married to that woman, you wouldn't search elsewhere?
[01:40:22.114 --> 01:40:23.335]  Take anything you get, baby.
[01:40:25.233 --> 01:40:27.234]  Oh, but then it gets even worse.
[01:40:27.234 --> 01:40:39.402]  And Bill Clinton says that he's a victim because he left the White House in debt.
[01:40:39.402 --> 01:40:43.364]  Do you remember when Hillary Clinton said that she was dead broke?
[01:40:43.364 --> 01:40:44.024]  Or who was it?
[01:40:44.024 --> 01:40:46.826]  Was it Hillary that said she was dead broke?
[01:40:46.826 --> 01:40:48.087]  Can you guys find that story?
[01:40:49.375 --> 01:40:51.897]  I think it was Hillary Clinton that said she was dead broke.
[01:40:51.897 --> 01:40:55.981]  No, no, no, she said, she said, we left the White House dead broke.
[01:40:55.981 --> 01:41:03.347]  I mean, do you want to talk about bold-faced liars?
[01:41:03.347 --> 01:41:03.907]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:41:03.907 --> 01:41:15.577]  But I am calling for the entire world to revisit the most famous selfie ever.
[01:41:15.577 --> 01:41:17.919]  Now, you may recall the most famous selfie ever.
[01:41:19.178 --> 01:41:21.720]  Taken by Ellen DeGeneres.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.241]  I think it's time we revisit this.
[01:41:23.241 --> 01:41:25.182]  You remember how famous this was?
[01:41:25.182 --> 01:41:27.224]  You remember how this was the biggest story?
[01:41:27.224 --> 01:41:30.166]  The most shared social media post?
[01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:32.588]  Well, let's share it again.
[01:41:32.588 --> 01:41:33.709]  Look at who you got here.
[01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:37.712]  You got Kevin Spacey in the background.
[01:41:37.712 --> 01:41:40.033]  Oh, everybody knew about him.
[01:41:40.033 --> 01:41:45.458]  You've got Meryl Streep in there as well, who worshipped Roman Polanski.
[01:41:46.383 --> 01:41:51.427]  You've got the Trump-hating Jennifer Lawrence, whose career is tanking.
[01:41:51.427 --> 01:42:00.874]  And you've got the entire Hollywood cabal that knew about Harvey Weinstein the whole time, right there.
[01:42:00.874 --> 01:42:06.018]  So let's revisit this social media post, the most famous social media post of all time.
[01:42:06.018 --> 01:42:10.401]  Let's re-share this with the hashtag, TheyAllKnew.
[01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:12.943]  And Harvey Weinstein is now being indicted in his rape case.
[01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:22.696]  Allison Mack is now trying to reach a plea bargain on her involvement in the sex trafficking of the Nexivim sex cult.
[01:42:29.568 --> 01:42:31.410]  They all knew about Harvey Weinstein.
[01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:33.192]  They all knew about Roman Polanski.
[01:42:33.192 --> 01:42:35.274]  They all knew about the sex cults.
[01:42:35.274 --> 01:42:36.275]  All of them.
[01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:42.241]  And then they all went out and virtue signaled to you that Trump was bad.
[01:42:42.241 --> 01:42:44.423]  Hashtag me too.
[01:42:44.423 --> 01:42:52.572]  The entire phony Hollywood cabal and establishment is falling apart at the seams.
[01:42:57.443 --> 01:43:03.705]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:02.163]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.163 --> 01:45:05.445]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.445 --> 01:45:11.709]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:14.471]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:15.211 --> 01:45:19.037]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:19.037 --> 01:45:25.527]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.527 --> 01:45:30.494]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.232 --> 01:45:35.153]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.153 --> 01:45:42.335]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:47.036]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.036 --> 01:45:53.238]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.238 --> 01:45:57.219]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.154 --> 01:46:05.076]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[01:46:05.076 --> 01:46:07.617]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[01:46:07.617 --> 01:46:11.838]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge.
[01:46:11.838 --> 01:46:13.859]  And the world is taking notice.
[01:46:14.819 --> 01:46:28.846]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropin.

[01:46:38.630 --> 01:46:40.071]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:19.545 --> 01:47:40.750]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:47.672]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, now you saw the attacks on Alex Jones on the
[01:47:49.213 --> 01:48:04.227]  Mill Bar Program, the Schmilschmar Program, the fake time with Schmilschmar, and you need to just understand the reason why they do this stuff is not for their own comical reasons.
[01:48:04.227 --> 01:48:13.776]  Maybe some of the writers have some political reasons and they think they can, I guess, make us look bad or whatever, they hate us, but the overall
[01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:23.191]  Consensus of the attacks on Infowars and Alex Jones are to create an environment where they can take us out.
[01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:26.796]  And you need to understand that's what's really behind all this stuff.
[01:48:26.796 --> 01:48:28.578]  They really want us shut down.
[01:48:28.578 --> 01:48:30.980]  They really hate us.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.883]  They can't stand us being there.
[01:48:34.312 --> 01:48:38.554]  And there's two kind of weird conflicts that they have with this.
[01:48:38.554 --> 01:48:48.018]  One, really it all comes from their own cowardice and their own inability to defeat us organically.
[01:48:48.018 --> 01:48:56.963]  So they kind of use the political strife and the political differences as a facade for their reason to bring us down.
[01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:59.344]  They'll say they don't like what we talk about, what we say.
[01:49:00.492 --> 01:49:05.974]  And there's a little element of truth to that, but that's really just a facade.
[01:49:05.974 --> 01:49:08.155]  That's really just a false narrative they put together.
[01:49:08.155 --> 01:49:15.898]  The real reason that a lot of these people want to shut down is because they can't compete with us!
[01:49:15.898 --> 01:49:27.483]  So they'll act, people like Bill Maher and his writers, it's really not even Bill Maher, it's just his writers, will act like we're bad, we have to be shut down because of the things we say.
[01:49:28.533 --> 01:49:35.396]  And that they disagree with really is that they can't compete with us.
[01:49:35.396 --> 01:49:51.083]  See, they didn't used to attack Alex like this and InfoWars like this 10 years ago when InfoWars didn't have an average weekly audience of probably 40 million people.
[01:49:51.083 --> 01:49:57.826]  Oh, but see, now they realize, whoa, their audience is probably bigger than ours.
[01:50:00.083 --> 01:50:01.104]  We can't stand for this.
[01:50:01.104 --> 01:50:02.746]  We can't have their message bigger than ours.
[01:50:02.746 --> 01:50:03.086]  No, no, no.
[01:50:03.086 --> 01:50:05.668]  It's their message that's the problem.
[01:50:05.668 --> 01:50:07.150]  Their message is the problem.
[01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:10.173]  No, you just can't compete with us.
[01:50:10.173 --> 01:50:11.334]  Think about this.
[01:50:11.334 --> 01:50:14.577]  Bill Maher does, what, a one-hour show once a week?
[01:50:16.636 --> 01:50:20.979]  One hour show, once a week, needs a team of writers and a teleprompter.
[01:50:20.979 --> 01:50:26.884]  We do ten hours of live broadcasting here, zero writers, zero teleprompters.
[01:50:26.884 --> 01:50:29.065]  Now, you want to know why they're afraid of us?
[01:50:29.065 --> 01:50:32.828]  Because they can't compete with us.
[01:50:32.828 --> 01:50:40.214]  And then the other added element of this that makes it so beautiful is that they can't shut us down because you fund us.
[01:50:41.383 --> 01:50:46.345]  So it's like, they can't go to the normal outlets to say, shut them down.
[01:50:46.345 --> 01:50:52.106]  They can't attack our sponsors and say, quit funding them, because our sponsors are you!
[01:50:52.106 --> 01:50:58.588]  And the more that they demonize us, you, our sponsors, support us more!
[01:50:58.588 --> 01:51:01.629]  And so, right now, we still have the extended special.
[01:51:01.629 --> 01:51:03.170]  I'm not sure how much longer this is going to last.
[01:51:04.505 --> 01:51:10.671]  At InfowarsStore.com, the Patriot Special, the Memorial Day Special, is still extended.
[01:51:10.671 --> 01:51:13.173]  Now, this is, like, ridiculous.
[01:51:13.173 --> 01:51:14.314]  This shouldn't be going on.
[01:51:14.314 --> 01:51:16.016]  I'm not sure how much longer this is going to last.
[01:51:16.016 --> 01:51:17.197]  I'm just telling you how it is.
[01:51:17.197 --> 01:51:24.764]  So I would take advantage of the free shipping storewide, the 50% off half the supplements right now.
[01:51:24.764 --> 01:51:29.328]  It's all at InfowarsStore.com, the Memorial Patriot Special extended.
[01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:32.872]  And I'm not just blowing smoke here, folks.
[01:51:32.872 --> 01:51:36.274]  I'm telling you, this special should have been shut down a while ago.
[01:51:36.274 --> 01:51:39.157]  And it's going to be shut down soon, I'm sure.
[01:51:39.157 --> 01:51:43.040]  So just take advantage of a 50% off the Brain Force Plus.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.742]  Take advantage of the 50% off Supermail Vitality.
[01:51:45.742 --> 01:51:47.763]  Take advantage of the 50% off the Immune Wall.
[01:51:47.763 --> 01:51:49.524]  The 50% off the Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:51:49.524 --> 01:51:52.327]  The list just goes on and on and on.
[01:51:52.327 --> 01:51:53.427]  50% off Alpha Power.
[01:51:53.427 --> 01:51:56.670]  25% off Survival Shield X2, a game-changing product.
[01:51:56.670 --> 01:51:57.991]  Free shipping store-wide!
[01:51:59.795 --> 01:52:04.282]  So you get the emergency food, which is pretty expensive to ship.
[01:52:04.282 --> 01:52:05.504]  Well, that's included.
[01:52:05.504 --> 01:52:08.229]  Free shipping.
[01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:12.876]  So it's all at InfoWareStore.com and it's your support that makes all of this possible.
[01:52:14.128 --> 01:52:25.839]  And if you listened to Alex Jones yesterday, you heard him talking about, you want to know the difference between a Glenn Beck and an Alex Jones or even a Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones?
[01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:29.503]  And I'm not trying to cast any shade in this analogy.
[01:52:29.503 --> 01:52:33.847]  Well, maybe to Glenn Beck more than anything, but look at what Alex has built.
[01:52:36.013 --> 01:52:42.476]  Four studios and a crew of now, I think, 40 or 50 people on the media side.
[01:52:42.476 --> 01:52:46.917]  When I got here, it was less than, I think, 30 people on the media side.
[01:52:46.917 --> 01:52:49.138]  Now it's up, I think, over 40.
[01:52:49.138 --> 01:52:51.599]  And I've been here for two years now.
[01:52:51.599 --> 01:52:57.202]  So that's what your support at Infowarsstore.com has done.
[01:52:57.202 --> 01:52:58.782]  And you haven't even seen the biggest studio.
[01:52:58.782 --> 01:53:02.264]  So look at what Alex Jones has done with your support and self-funding
[01:53:03.106 --> 01:53:09.969]  Versus what others in media do with corporate funding and a lot more of it.
[01:53:09.969 --> 01:53:12.850]  Nobody builds what Alex has built.
[01:53:12.850 --> 01:53:16.432]  Nobody's done what Alex has done to try to change the world.
[01:53:16.432 --> 01:53:20.714]  So that's what your support at InfoWarsTore.com does.
[01:53:20.714 --> 01:53:23.115]  So take advantage of the specials right now.
[01:53:24.426 --> 01:53:30.752]  And, as we're under more attack than ever, you know what we need, and that's funding for all the lawsuits we have to fight, too.
[01:53:30.752 --> 01:53:34.736]  So, it's all possible with your support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:53:34.736 --> 01:53:36.938]  Alright, let me just close out the hour here.
[01:53:38.001 --> 01:53:45.849]  And then recharge the batteries in the next hour, where we're going to be joined by Andrey Afanasyev from Sargrad.tv.
[01:53:45.849 --> 01:53:57.440]  He's going to be talking about the fake death of the anti-Kremlin journalist, and of course I want to get into the Skripal case, where I think it's the same deal.
[01:53:58.869 --> 01:54:07.474]  I think that it was probably British intelligence or something to do with British intelligence, the poisoning, and then they tried to blame Russia.
[01:54:07.474 --> 01:54:10.795]  Much like the fake death which was tried to be blamed on Russia.
[01:54:10.795 --> 01:54:18.039]  So we'll get into that with Andrey Afanasyev from sargrad.tv in the third hour.
[01:54:18.039 --> 01:54:19.660]  But first, let me just go to this clip here.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:21.961]  This is clip seven, guys.
[01:54:21.961 --> 01:54:22.982]  Now, you'll remember
[01:54:24.522 --> 01:54:29.586]  During the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton would just disappear for weeks at a time.
[01:54:29.586 --> 01:54:32.849]  She'd just vanish, which is unheard of during a presidential campaign.
[01:54:32.849 --> 01:54:34.130]  Now, we knew what was going on.
[01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:36.031]  She was having serious health concerns.
[01:54:36.031 --> 01:54:37.132]  Still is.
[01:54:37.132 --> 01:54:38.393]  You know, she has to wear Caesar glasses.
[01:54:38.393 --> 01:54:41.215]  Now she has to wear, like, a back brace everywhere she goes.
[01:54:41.215 --> 01:54:43.797]  I guess that's what you have to do when you don't have a spine.
[01:54:43.797 --> 01:54:47.060]  But, remember, we would report, where is Hillary?
[01:54:48.072 --> 01:54:51.053]  And the media said, look at the crazy saying, where is Hillary?
[01:54:51.053 --> 01:54:58.496]  Oh, but now look at Brian Pennywise Stelter in clip seven, wondering where Melania Trump is.
[01:54:58.496 --> 01:55:03.377]  President, the White House has been quite quiet about, uh, is Melania Trump and her status.
[01:55:03.377 --> 01:55:12.401]  We did see her tweet the other day, but the first time we've caught a glimpse of her, the last time we caught a glimpse of her was on May 10th.
[01:55:12.401 --> 01:55:13.181]  More than three weeks.
[01:55:13.581 --> 01:55:15.323]  We need to report bad news about her!
[01:55:31.744 --> 01:55:33.286]  This is too glorious!
[01:55:33.286 --> 01:55:47.264]  Melania Trump is trolling Brian... Melania Trump literally puts out that tweet to troll the Brian Stelters of the world and... People, you need to understand... These people's IQs are that low!
[01:55:48.632 --> 01:55:52.294]  That they literally take the troll on live TV.
[01:55:52.294 --> 01:55:57.838]  He's literally, he's engaging in the troll on live TV!
[01:55:57.838 --> 01:56:01.260]  You're who she's talking about, Pennywise Stelter!
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:01.580]  Folks.
[01:56:05.256 --> 01:56:10.780]  I've met a lot of these people in media, and I can tell the difference between a Van Jones and a Don Lemon.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:15.043]  Van Jones actually probably has a pretty high IQ, pretty smart guy.
[01:56:15.043 --> 01:56:17.806]  That's how he was able to get on Obama's administration.
[01:56:17.806 --> 01:56:22.569]  Don Lemon has the IQ of a lemon head.
[01:56:22.569 --> 01:56:28.814]  Brian Stelter has the IQ of a Pennywise red balloon.
[01:56:28.814 --> 01:56:30.215]  Let the segment speak for itself.
[01:56:30.215 --> 01:56:31.396]  Go back to Pennywise Stelter.
[01:56:32.708 --> 01:56:39.315]  What I'm doing, rest assured, is that I'm here at the White House with my family, feeling great and working hard on behalf of the American people.
[01:56:39.315 --> 01:56:41.117]  And then you take the troll and report on it!
[01:56:41.117 --> 01:56:45.081]  How long does she have to be out of sight to make this a legitimate media story?
[01:56:45.081 --> 01:56:49.045]  Well, I think it's a legitimate media story because of the... Pause it, pause it, pause it!
[01:56:49.045 --> 01:56:50.948]  There's no evidence of Russian collusion!
[01:56:52.208 --> 01:57:02.350]  Except on the Democrat side, no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, made-up story about some dossier, made-up story about some pee tapes, nothing!
[01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:03.410]  Literally nothing!
[01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:18.554]  And CNN dedicates hours and days and months and years on end to reporting on a nothing story, and then Brian Pennywise-Stelter looks like Humpty Dumpty, and he gets up there, and he gets up there, and he says,
[01:57:20.154 --> 01:57:26.335]  How much information do we need to know until it's a legitimate media story?
[01:57:26.335 --> 01:57:27.035]  Bro!
[01:57:27.035 --> 01:57:31.056]  You report fake news willingly for a living!
[01:57:31.056 --> 01:57:33.857]  Brian Pennywise Stelter!
[01:57:33.857 --> 01:57:35.977]  Who has a lower IQ?
[01:57:35.977 --> 01:57:43.238]  Brian Pennywise Stelter, Don Lemon, or this pen on the desk?
[01:57:43.238 --> 01:57:44.399]  That's a serious question.
[01:57:44.399 --> 01:57:46.059]  This pen actually serves a purpose.
[01:57:48.533 --> 01:57:57.078]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.

[01:58:57.869 --> 01:59:05.754]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:05.754 --> 01:59:08.896]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:59:09.096 --> 01:59:14.379]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:59:14.379 --> 01:59:17.141]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[01:59:26.286 --> 01:59:27.667]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:57.555 --> 02:00:03.103]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:03.103 --> 02:00:08.651]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:11.595]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:53.099]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show short segment here where I'm going to introduce my guest Andrey Afanasyev from Sargrad TV and you know there's something important to be understood when it comes to the story about the quote-unquote assassinated or dead journalist
[02:00:54.673 --> 02:01:03.096]  That was reporting anti-Kremlin news or whatever they want to say, insinuating he was assassinated by Putin, assassinated by the Kremlin, right?
[02:01:03.096 --> 02:01:18.521]  And they run that story, the fake news takes off, and more people hear that than they do the fact that it was not even true, that it was a fake death and fake news.
[02:01:18.521 --> 02:01:21.142]  But the important thing to understand about this is that
[02:01:22.628 --> 02:01:27.654]  This isn't an isolated incident, and who knows how many deaths have been faked?
[02:01:27.654 --> 02:01:29.616]  Who knows how many news stories have been faked?
[02:01:29.616 --> 02:01:33.701]  Well, we know a lot of them get faked, and we call them out here at InfoWars.
[02:01:33.701 --> 02:01:41.971]  So, to join me and break this down, short segment here, he's going to stick around for two more segments on the other side, Andrey Afanasyev from Sargrad TV.
[02:01:43.499 --> 02:02:00.955]  Now, you see stories like this all the time, Andre, where you'll say, anti-Putin journalist dead, anti-Kremlin journalist winds up dead, and it always gets, you know, put, oh, Putin the bad guy, Putin regime bad, Russia bad, but then you find this story and it turns out to be a fake death story.
[02:02:01.676 --> 02:02:05.477]  You know, I don't see media apologizing to Putin, though.
[02:02:05.477 --> 02:02:11.438]  I don't see people saying, oh, sorry, Putin, to make you out to be this, you know, crazy assassin, the leader of Russia.
[02:02:11.438 --> 02:02:18.200]  No, it's just, oh, it was just fake news, and then bury the story.
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:19.200]  Hello, Owen.
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:23.421]  I'm glad to hear again, and I want to say hi to all of your audience.
[02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:31.023]  Well, you know, we're living in a world where truth is not a value anymore for a lot of people, especially in media.
[02:02:31.972 --> 02:02:45.277]  And all the media that used to be known for being objective, or at least trying to be objective, is now just an instrument of a fight between globalists and nationalists.
[02:02:45.277 --> 02:02:59.302]  And there is nothing surprising, at least for us here in Russia, that mainstream Western media try to use any possibility to hit Russia, to hit Russian people, to hit our president.
[02:02:59.302 --> 02:03:00.403]  Because, well, it's a war!
[02:03:01.087 --> 02:03:07.772]  It's an infowar, and we're in it, and a lot of people now understand it and just don't believe media.
[02:03:07.772 --> 02:03:27.425]  And that's the point, because, you know, recently I've delivered a big speech on a conference on false truth and fake news, and I've come to a conclusion that before trusting and believing any media, you must understand who's owning it.
[02:03:27.425 --> 02:03:28.506]  Because any
[02:03:29.278 --> 02:03:40.665]  Media piece, any meme posted, any article and every video segment is done for a reason, not just for fun.
[02:03:40.665 --> 02:03:46.749]  Because there are thousands of times more news in the world than are reported.
[02:03:46.749 --> 02:03:48.891]  And people now start thinking that
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.022]  Only these things that are reported by media are actually happening in the world.
[02:03:55.022 --> 02:03:58.604]  And if something is not reported by media, then it never existed.
[02:03:58.604 --> 02:04:02.266]  And you know, it's a fake, fake feeling of reality.
[02:04:02.266 --> 02:04:09.849]  And you know, you said something that I want to get to on the other side, and that's about believing the fake news anymore, specifically when it comes to Russians.
[02:04:09.849 --> 02:04:12.090]  I want to address that on the other side.
[02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:14.772]  But it's just incredible here.
[02:04:15.916 --> 02:04:18.838]  I think we need to introduce a new thing that you're kind of touching on here.
[02:04:18.838 --> 02:04:20.739]  We know about false flags.
[02:04:20.739 --> 02:04:23.421]  We know about false narratives.
[02:04:23.421 --> 02:04:26.243]  But do we know about a false consensus?
[02:04:26.243 --> 02:04:27.644]  And that's what the media tries to do.
[02:04:27.644 --> 02:04:35.750]  They try to create a false consensus with Hollywood, with television celebrities, and sports athletes, and then the mainstream fake news media.
[02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:37.331]  They try to create a false census.
[02:04:37.771 --> 02:04:40.812]  An example here in America, OH AMERICA HATES TRUMP!
[02:04:40.812 --> 02:04:41.692]  TRUMP RACIST!
[02:04:41.692 --> 02:04:42.233]  TRUMP THIS!
[02:04:42.233 --> 02:04:42.793]  TRUMP THAT!
[02:04:42.793 --> 02:04:48.295]  Like there's a false consensus, even though it's not a real consensus, most Americans don't feel that way.
[02:04:48.295 --> 02:04:52.956]  So now media tries to create a false consensus with all its operatives and all its different wings.
[02:04:52.956 --> 02:04:54.597]  We'll get into that more with Andre on the other side.
[02:04:56.527 --> 02:04:58.848]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:07.339 --> 02:06:18.066]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:18.066 --> 02:06:27.632]  Once again, Owen Troyer here filling in for Alex Jones, but we will be hearing from Alex Jones before the conclusion of this broadcast with
[02:06:29.144 --> 02:06:31.465]  Footage that is sure to go viral.
[02:06:31.465 --> 02:06:36.007]  Alex Jones vs. Bernie Sanders at LA International Airport.
[02:06:36.007 --> 02:06:38.008]  You're not going to want to miss that.
[02:06:38.008 --> 02:06:40.930]  We'll debut that on the Alex Jones Show before our conclusion.
[02:06:40.930 --> 02:06:41.230]  However...
[02:06:43.433 --> 02:06:49.335]  For the meantime, I am joined by Andrey Afanasyev from sargrad.tv.
[02:06:49.335 --> 02:07:00.140]  In the segment before this, we were briefly getting into what we're going to discuss here with the fake journalism, fake journalist's death that was reported turned out to be fake.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:05.722]  And I also want to get into a little bit of the screep halls with Andrey as well.
[02:07:05.722 --> 02:07:08.303]  But first, I want to get back to something he said in the last segment.
[02:07:11.297 --> 02:07:22.364]  I just want to know, here in America, Andre, I think it's still maybe, I mean, mainstream news is getting bad ratings, trust levels are really low.
[02:07:22.364 --> 02:07:30.289]  The average American, I think, is kind of knowing now how the media deceives, mainstream media deceives, but it's not really universal.
[02:07:30.289 --> 02:07:40.156]  I still think there's a large swath of the population here that still doesn't understand truly what fake news is or still falls for a lot of the television news without even thinking twice about it.
[02:07:40.896 --> 02:07:52.180]  But I'm just curious, in Russia, where you have, honestly, the stories that they use to attack Putin are in a way worse than what they use to attack Trump.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.361]  Where with Trump it's like from every angle.
[02:07:54.361 --> 02:07:59.643]  With Putin though, they always try to put these journalist deaths on Putin's name.
[02:07:59.643 --> 02:08:06.286]  And then it comes out, you find out that the most recent story about this journalist, Bebchenko, was fake news and he wasn't dead.
[02:08:07.441 --> 02:08:10.343]  So, I guess it's kind of a two-part question.
[02:08:10.343 --> 02:08:16.827]  One, do people in Russia understand, pretty much for the most part, what fake news is and all the fake news that comes out?
[02:08:16.827 --> 02:08:25.832]  And then two, how many of these other stories about journalists that they've blamed on Putin for being deceased were fake news?
[02:08:25.832 --> 02:08:30.795]  Well, there is not a single case of a murdered journalist
[02:08:31.890 --> 02:08:40.599]  That is proven to be killed by state-related people, especially by people related to the president of the country.
[02:08:40.599 --> 02:08:47.865]  Your audience must understand that we in Russia have more freedom of speech than any Western country now has.
[02:08:47.865 --> 02:08:50.328]  Because we have all the spectrum of media.
[02:08:50.328 --> 02:08:52.310]  We have state-owned media.
[02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:55.693]  We have a lot of liberal finance from the West media.
[02:08:56.542 --> 02:09:06.364]  Like five or six big major channels, dozens of websites with big audience and a lot of social media products.
[02:09:06.364 --> 02:09:12.946]  And we have some conservative traditionalist media like ours.
[02:09:12.946 --> 02:09:14.166]  We are not that numerous.
[02:09:14.166 --> 02:09:15.806]  Our media is major and big.
[02:09:15.806 --> 02:09:23.608]  But if we compare ourselves to the liberal segment, we're still a little smaller, even though we appeared five or six years ago.
[02:09:24.228 --> 02:09:26.529]  We are independent, but still patriotic.
[02:09:26.529 --> 02:09:35.993]  We are not owned by the state, so we are not obliged to fulfill some kind of expectations like any state or media around the world.
[02:09:35.993 --> 02:09:37.654]  We can say whatever we can.
[02:09:37.654 --> 02:09:43.556]  So, and the second thing is that you must understand some things about Ukraine.
[02:09:43.556 --> 02:09:47.118]  Ukraine is a Russia that West would like to see.
[02:09:48.252 --> 02:10:03.627]  Ukraine is a part of the former Soviet Union, Russian Empire, synthetically cut from the main body of Russia by Bolsheviks, by Neo-Marxists, and they made these people think that they are not Russians but something else.
[02:10:03.627 --> 02:10:05.449]  Well, you know, it's something like California.
[02:10:06.241 --> 02:10:18.507]  A bit, because, well, also it's a state that is ultra-liberal now, and a state that wants to integrate in a globalist, Atlanticist system.
[02:10:18.507 --> 02:10:21.648]  And all the rest things are the same.
[02:10:21.648 --> 02:10:22.749]  They are the same people as us.
[02:10:22.749 --> 02:10:25.190]  They speak the same language.
[02:10:25.190 --> 02:10:29.272]  They have the same faith and so on.
[02:10:29.272 --> 02:10:35.255]  But Ukraine, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is totally controlled by the West.
[02:10:35.897 --> 02:10:52.410]  Through networks, through spy agencies, there is not a single officer in the Ukrainian special service called SBU, Security Service of Ukraine, higher in rank than colonel.
[02:10:52.410 --> 02:10:55.493]  That is not a CIA or MI6 agent.
[02:10:55.493 --> 02:11:04.200]  So if you become a colonel of this secret special service of Ukraine, you're probably having double citizenship or green card at least.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:06.982]  That's what I can say.
[02:11:06.982 --> 02:11:17.431]  And a journalist that always has been for 10 or 15 years already, 10 years, has been a flagrant opposition speaker.
[02:11:18.254 --> 02:11:27.879]  He worked for a liberal newspaper owned by Netherlands, by a group of business from Netherlands.
[02:11:27.879 --> 02:11:38.886]  He went to Ukraine because, you know, if you're a position journalist, you are welcome there because they need people who will criticize Putin and Russia for being independent and so on.
[02:11:38.886 --> 02:11:41.447]  And this person fakes his own death.
[02:11:42.412 --> 02:11:48.716]  And then says, well, that's that's Russia that Putin and the Ukrainian special services saved me.
[02:11:48.716 --> 02:11:51.518]  Well, you know, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes.
[02:11:51.518 --> 02:11:58.543]  You don't need to be a genius to understand that this is some kind of a really low quality scheme.
[02:11:58.543 --> 02:12:10.772]  And moreover, it's a scheme 100 percent duplicated with the same, copied with the same as the Skripal case, because also Skripal was
[02:12:11.773 --> 02:12:13.234]  A defector.
[02:12:13.234 --> 02:12:23.080]  Skripal was a special service officer from Russia who went to Great Britain and sold all the secrets he knew.
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:28.763]  He sold information about our special agents in Great Britain.
[02:12:28.763 --> 02:12:30.124]  And after that he stayed there.
[02:12:30.124 --> 02:12:31.845]  So technically he's a cheater.
[02:12:31.845 --> 02:12:35.988]  And he betrayed his country, his motherland.
[02:12:35.988 --> 02:12:38.289]  He's not an officer anymore.
[02:12:38.289 --> 02:12:41.231]  If we talk about, you know, things like honor.
[02:12:42.782 --> 02:12:59.048]  And ten years after it happened, ten years after he got to Great Britain, because he was exchanged for several Russian special service agents that were caught in the United States and Great Britain.
[02:12:59.048 --> 02:13:06.810]  After he came to Great Britain, he lived for ten years, and then suddenly he is poisoned.
[02:13:06.810 --> 02:13:09.231]  Every crime needs to have a motive.
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:21.465]  What is the motive for Russia to poison a defector that sold all the cigarettes many years ago and for 10 years has been living in Great Britain with no connection to Russia?
[02:13:21.465 --> 02:13:26.607]  What's the motive for doing this on the eve of presidential elections?
[02:13:26.607 --> 02:13:28.468]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[02:13:28.468 --> 02:13:30.089]  The second point, what's the motive of
[02:13:31.227 --> 02:13:44.018]  Killing or trying to kill a journalist who does not affect us anyhow now because he works in Ukraine and all he can do is sell his articles to several opposition newspapers.
[02:13:44.018 --> 02:13:52.586]  What's the use of killing this person and being caught on the eve of a World Football Championship in Russia?
[02:13:52.586 --> 02:13:54.948]  You know that it's going to happen soon, in two weeks.
[02:13:56.123 --> 02:14:02.967]  We're going to host the international competition that is very big, especially in Europe and Russia and Asia.
[02:14:02.967 --> 02:14:06.470]  You know, we have our own soccer.
[02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:10.232]  We call it football, but it's different and it's really popular all over the world.
[02:14:11.305 --> 02:14:15.188]  Yeah, of course, you're referring to the World Cup, which is going to Russia.
[02:14:15.188 --> 02:14:17.070]  It's one of the biggest events in the world.
[02:14:17.070 --> 02:14:20.373]  I mean, if not the biggest event in the world.
[02:14:20.373 --> 02:14:30.081]  I mean, obviously you hope everything is good with that and that there's no, you know, strange interventions to try to, you know, stop that from going over smoothly.
[02:14:30.081 --> 02:14:36.766]  But I'm just curious because now I'm looking at this Skripal case, which actually has more questions than answers now.
[02:14:36.766 --> 02:14:39.368]  It's like everything that they were telling us originally about this
[02:14:40.461 --> 02:14:43.883]  Has kind of ended up being not true, but let's get to that on the other side.
[02:14:43.883 --> 02:14:50.686]  I've got 60 seconds till this break now, so let's just hold that thought till the other side, and we'll get to that.
[02:14:50.686 --> 02:14:54.488]  Because some people are now saying they think the entire story was made up.
[02:14:54.488 --> 02:15:04.874]  Others are saying that they think, and I'm kind of more on the side that maybe if there was a poisoning that it would have been from British intelligence, but we'll get Andrei Afanasyev's take on the other side.
[02:15:05.234 --> 02:15:07.876]  Folks, in the meantime, in case you haven't noticed, look at how great our guests are.
[02:15:07.876 --> 02:15:14.420]  We get guests from Russia, we get Leo Zagami, an expert on the Italy elections and everything that's going on right there.

[02:20:15.275 --> 02:20:22.339]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.339 --> 02:20:26.541]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:20:26.541 --> 02:20:29.203]  Can you feel liberty rising?
[02:20:29.203 --> 02:20:31.924]  Well, I certainly can.
[02:20:31.924 --> 02:20:33.525]  And you know who else can?
[02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:41.610]  The anti-human freedom globalists that create fake news to stop anybody in their way.
[02:20:42.773 --> 02:21:00.399]  And if that somebody happens to be Vladimir Putin, then they will stage fake deaths in order to create fake news headlines and try to dehumanize Vladimir Putin and Russia that has continued to rise from the decay of communism.
[02:21:00.399 --> 02:21:08.762]  And as our guest Andrei Afanasyev said, he believes now that they have more free speech in Russia than they do in the United States.
[02:21:08.762 --> 02:21:09.482]  So how about that?
[02:21:12.045 --> 02:21:19.172]  We talked about the faked death of Bebchenko in Ukraine.
[02:21:19.172 --> 02:21:20.373]  They totally faked that.
[02:21:20.373 --> 02:21:23.296]  That gets reported and totally uncovered.
[02:21:23.296 --> 02:21:25.058]  But now let's go to the Skripal case.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:44.447]  Andre, would it really be that shocking that an anti-Russian journalist, anti-Kremlin journalist, would get behind a faking of his own death ahead of the elections to try to hurt Vladimir Putin and to create that negative headline?
[02:21:44.447 --> 02:21:52.711]  Or would you say that detractors in Britain perhaps have an interest to create that headline and maybe they would be the ones to
[02:21:54.031 --> 02:22:11.523]  Do the poisoning seems to be more of a reasoning for those two to go down than for Putin to be involved with any poisoning of that journalist, especially when it came to a closure with the exchange of all the people that that journalist sold out going back to Russia, if I understand it correctly.
[02:22:11.523 --> 02:22:13.184]  But what do you think was the case here?
[02:22:13.184 --> 02:22:15.005]  Do you think this was a fake death?
[02:22:15.005 --> 02:22:17.047]  Do you think this was a real poisoning?
[02:22:17.047 --> 02:22:18.508]  What do you think is really going on?
[02:22:18.508 --> 02:22:22.851]  Because now there's more questions than answers revolving around this Skripal case.
[02:22:24.824 --> 02:22:36.128]  Well, Owen, first of all, let's understand that no one likes traitors, even those who benefited from their treachery.
[02:22:36.128 --> 02:22:39.369]  So Mr. Skripal made his choice.
[02:22:39.369 --> 02:22:40.670]  He betrayed his country.
[02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:44.071]  He betrayed his honor as an officer of special service.
[02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:52.534]  He betrayed his colleagues who got into trouble in Great Britain because of his defection.
[02:22:53.704 --> 02:23:06.211]  So, but Britain, after letting him in, wouldn't be happy just having this person on welfare forever for his one episode of being useful.
[02:23:06.211 --> 02:23:14.916]  So, of course, I think that they didn't stop using him and squeezing all the other information he could probably possess.
[02:23:15.976 --> 02:23:22.262]  And after they squeezed everything from him, that is absolutely rational and normal from the point of view of special services.
[02:23:22.262 --> 02:23:32.191]  If you have a defector, you need to squeeze everything from this person in order to get as much information about your possible enemy as you can.
[02:23:32.191 --> 02:23:36.195]  But after that, I think they decided to use him in this kind of provocation.
[02:23:36.195 --> 02:23:40.159]  Because the timing of this provocation, right on the election eve,
[02:23:41.327 --> 02:23:47.493]  Uh, in Russia shows that it was well prepared and planned long time ago.
[02:23:47.493 --> 02:23:48.994]  Also, nothing special.
[02:23:48.994 --> 02:23:52.737]  Also, uh, I cannot say that is something new.
[02:23:52.737 --> 02:23:57.541]  It's a typical, you know, uh, style of British special services.
[02:23:57.541 --> 02:24:00.864]  Another style of British special services is poisoning.
[02:24:01.963 --> 02:24:13.949]  You know, I've talked to a lot of specialists and historians of special services, and they said that Russians, we don't usually poison people.
[02:24:15.651 --> 02:24:26.780]  Throughout our history, we all understand that special services do not always operate in the framework of law in any country, and that's why they're called special.
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:30.202]  But poisoning is not Russian style.
[02:24:30.202 --> 02:24:33.324]  You know, and let's actually be a little more clear about this.
[02:24:33.324 --> 02:24:42.391]  They found out that the poison that they're claiming was used actually was manufactured in a British lab just like a mile from the site.
[02:24:43.482 --> 02:24:46.086]  Not mile, 10 or 15 miles from this site.
[02:24:46.086 --> 02:24:46.807]  That's true.
[02:24:46.807 --> 02:24:47.288]  Yeah.
[02:24:47.288 --> 02:24:47.588]  Yes.
[02:24:47.588 --> 02:24:49.391]  But still, still, it's not Moscow.
[02:24:49.391 --> 02:24:51.714]  You know, they said it could be manufactured in Moscow.
[02:24:51.714 --> 02:24:52.075]  All right.
[02:24:52.075 --> 02:24:53.517]  But how could it get?
[02:24:54.133 --> 02:25:00.816]  To Britain, because Great Britain has the strictest immigration laws, especially for Russians.
[02:25:00.816 --> 02:25:08.478]  You know, it's more difficult for a Russian like me to get to Britain than for a guy from Pakistan or Middle East.
[02:25:08.478 --> 02:25:09.579]  So that's true.
[02:25:09.579 --> 02:25:13.460]  So, I mean, you're going to get in real trouble before doing that.
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:18.182]  So you need to file the documents 40 days, at least 40 days before your trip.
[02:25:19.011 --> 02:25:25.841]  And on the border you'll be checked like your surname is Bin Laden.
[02:25:25.841 --> 02:25:26.521]  Be sure for that.
[02:25:26.521 --> 02:25:27.302]  Absolutely.
[02:25:36.604 --> 02:25:41.066]  Well, they could be poisoned, and they could be poisoned without knowing it.
[02:25:41.066 --> 02:25:50.771]  So I think that what happened is that some kind of MI6 operatives asked Skripal to take his daughter to a place to meet and to discuss something.
[02:25:50.771 --> 02:25:59.115]  Skripal took his daughter, they were waiting in the street, and then someone sprayed some kind of agent that would poison but not kill them.
[02:26:00.057 --> 02:26:02.659]  And after that, we saw all these scenarios.
[02:26:02.659 --> 02:26:10.583]  So the Skripals, Sergei and his poor daughter, they probably didn't know that they could be part of that.
[02:26:10.583 --> 02:26:12.124]  That's the other point.
[02:26:12.124 --> 02:26:14.726]  Skripals could know this or not.
[02:26:14.726 --> 02:26:20.369]  Why I think that they didn't know, because after all this situation, we saw
[02:26:22.605 --> 02:26:33.745]  His daughter Julia Skripal appear on cameras and we saw traces of tracheotomy on her neck here.
[02:26:34.517 --> 02:26:48.080]  So, and that shows that she has undergone some kind of medication, some kind of surgery, and regarding her maybe lungs, trachea or bronx.
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:57.943]  So, that's why I think that she probably was poisoned or exposed to some kind of chemical that could harm her.
[02:26:57.943 --> 02:27:03.804]  Okay, but now let's bring this all home and let's tie it back in to Babchenko, the journalist whose death was fake.
[02:27:06.021 --> 02:27:20.347]  People need to understand this, and let's hear it from you in the final 60 seconds here, that if they would do this, if they would pretend to fake a death in order to go after Putin, what else would they do?
[02:27:20.347 --> 02:27:22.228]  This is not an isolated incident.
[02:27:22.228 --> 02:27:33.073]  So just real quickly, Andrey Afanasyev from sargrad.tv, just for my audience, explain how this is not an isolated incident and they fake events like this all the time for political agendas.
[02:27:34.076 --> 02:27:43.941]  Well, I can tell you this, because when Boris Nemtsov was killed in Moscow, Boris Nemtsov, it was, I think, February 2016.
[02:27:43.941 --> 02:27:48.803]  And I remember that I was working on the site.
[02:27:48.803 --> 02:27:53.725]  Boris Nemtsov was an opposition politician.
[02:27:53.725 --> 02:27:54.966]  He wasn't that popular.
[02:27:54.966 --> 02:28:00.109]  Opposition in Russia in general is not that numerous and popular, but for the West, he was, you know,
[02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:05.615]  Sort of an icon of Russian opposition, just like Navalny.
[02:28:05.615 --> 02:28:14.618]  And of course, after his death, he became even more popular in the West, even though he didn't have any power or any ambitions at this time.
[02:28:14.618 --> 02:28:17.780]  And I understood that it was a false flag.
[02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:20.961]  When I saw the U.S.
[02:28:20.961 --> 02:28:26.023]  ambassador to Russia, I forgot his surname, after McFaul,
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:31.763]  And it all ties back to what you said in the first segment about Ukraine.
[02:28:31.763 --> 02:28:33.464]  Andrei Afanasyev, Sargrad.TV.
[02:28:33.464 --> 02:28:34.104]  Thank you.

[02:30:07.305 --> 02:30:17.668]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books.
[02:30:17.788 --> 02:30:18.549]  Thank you, brother.

[02:31:56.152 --> 02:32:03.780]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:11.709]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:32:11.709 --> 02:32:14.793]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:32:15.413 --> 02:32:20.058]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:20.058 --> 02:32:24.201]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:27.344]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:27.344 --> 02:32:32.109]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:32.109 --> 02:32:35.152]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:35.552 --> 02:32:50.640]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.

[02:32:59.865 --> 02:33:02.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[02:33:12.936 --> 02:33:18.542]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:18.542 --> 02:33:21.345]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:21.345 --> 02:33:23.287]  Yeah!
[02:33:23.287 --> 02:33:26.430]  Yeah, America's back!
[02:33:28.407 --> 02:33:29.948]  You wonder why Obama?
[02:33:29.948 --> 02:33:35.830]  You know, the media wants to make this story about Melania Trump apparently in hiding or something.
[02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:42.633]  You know, you're not allowed to talk about Hillary disappearing in the middle of a presidential election, but Melania Trump is supposed to be, you know, everywhere all the time.
[02:33:42.633 --> 02:33:43.234]  Where's Melania?
[02:33:43.234 --> 02:33:44.574]  Where's Melania?
[02:33:44.574 --> 02:33:48.496]  How about, where's Obama?
[02:33:48.496 --> 02:33:51.498]  Where is Obama?
[02:33:51.498 --> 02:33:54.279]  There's the CNN graphic.
[02:33:54.279 --> 02:33:56.360]  Last seen, Melania Trump, May 10th.
[02:33:57.824 --> 02:34:04.707]  And then she tweets out, she's like, hey, members of the pathetic media, I'm fine, just spending time with my family.
[02:34:04.707 --> 02:34:09.610]  And then Brian Pennywise Stelter gets up on CNN and is like, where's Melania?
[02:34:09.610 --> 02:34:12.311]  We see the tweet, but where is she?
[02:34:12.311 --> 02:34:15.993]  She says she's with family and she's fine, but where is she really?
[02:34:15.993 --> 02:34:18.354]  Can I report that she's dead?
[02:34:18.354 --> 02:34:21.276]  I'll do it, I'm Brian Stelter.
[02:34:21.276 --> 02:34:26.138]  Haven't seen Melania Trump in a month, she must be dead.
[02:34:26.138 --> 02:34:27.279]  But how about Obama?
[02:34:29.079 --> 02:34:29.879]  Here's a guy.
[02:34:29.879 --> 02:34:34.001]  Oh, I love that one.
[02:34:34.001 --> 02:34:36.442]  I went back and I tried to source that tweet.
[02:34:36.442 --> 02:34:39.143]  I could never even find it.
[02:34:39.143 --> 02:34:40.744]  Oh yeah, see, it's fake!
[02:34:40.744 --> 02:34:44.705]  Even Snopes admits it's fake!
[02:34:44.705 --> 02:34:46.306]  This is hilarious!
[02:34:46.306 --> 02:34:53.669]  Some morons in the Democrat Party actually spread that fake image as if it was real.
[02:34:54.662 --> 02:34:56.162]  It was fake!
[02:34:56.162 --> 02:35:04.865]  A fake tweet.
[02:35:04.865 --> 02:35:07.845]  They're so desperate, man.
[02:35:07.845 --> 02:35:11.206]  But where's Obama?
[02:35:11.206 --> 02:35:12.087]  Oh, let's see.
[02:35:12.087 --> 02:35:14.527]  Obama's library in Chicago.
[02:35:14.527 --> 02:35:14.927]  You know what?
[02:35:14.927 --> 02:35:16.028]  Let's go into the news right now.
[02:35:16.028 --> 02:35:17.328]  I got a stack right here.
[02:35:23.035 --> 02:35:24.575]  This is from the New York Times.
[02:35:24.575 --> 02:35:28.056]  Brace yourselves.
[02:35:28.056 --> 02:35:29.136]  Brace yourselves.
[02:35:29.136 --> 02:35:32.237]  New York Times, Maureen Dowd.
[02:35:32.237 --> 02:35:43.559]  Obama is just too good for us.
[02:35:43.559 --> 02:35:45.659]  Oh, I'm glad I can laugh today.
[02:35:45.659 --> 02:35:47.580]  Obama is just too good for us.
[02:35:51.638 --> 02:35:53.579]  What does that even mean?
[02:35:53.579 --> 02:35:54.419]  Oh, now I see.
[02:35:54.419 --> 02:36:00.142]  No, no, no, this actually explains the answer to my question.
[02:36:00.142 --> 02:36:07.986]  See, I was wondering where was Obama, you know, in the middle of all of the Spygate, in the middle of his library.
[02:36:09.079 --> 02:36:18.663]  Being protested, that's right, his library in Chicago, one of his hometowns, his library is being protested.
[02:36:18.663 --> 02:36:26.707]  There's now a community organization in Chicago to shut his library down, saying that it was getting funding on false premises illegally.
[02:36:26.707 --> 02:36:33.310]  That really fits the Obama bill, doesn't it?
[02:36:33.310 --> 02:36:33.670]  And so,
[02:36:35.057 --> 02:37:01.347]  Obama, in the middle of Spygate, in the middle of the illegal spying, in the middle of the abuses of power, in the expose of all the texts and emails that implicate him being involved in the entire illegal spy campaign, plus his library that was supposed to be his baby in Chicago looks like Mecca West, now has, say it looks like a Chinese takeout box, no it looks like Mecca West,
[02:37:02.406 --> 02:37:12.431]  Has community organizers in Chicago protesting and trying to get it shut down because it got illegal funding on false premises.
[02:37:12.431 --> 02:37:14.171]  So where's Obama?
[02:37:14.171 --> 02:37:15.712]  Where is Obama?
[02:37:15.712 --> 02:37:17.713]  Maybe he's on the Lolita Express.
[02:37:17.713 --> 02:37:24.576]  Maybe he's on Virgin Mobile, Richard Branson's Island.
[02:37:24.576 --> 02:37:25.176]  Maybe he's there.
[02:37:25.176 --> 02:37:25.596]  I don't know.
[02:37:25.596 --> 02:37:26.417]  I don't know where he is.
[02:37:28.936 --> 02:37:38.123]  He certainly isn't showing his face in the middle of all the news implicating him in the biggest scandal in U.S.
[02:37:38.123 --> 02:37:39.544]  government history!
[02:37:39.544 --> 02:37:42.467]  Oh, there he is, we found him.
[02:37:42.467 --> 02:37:45.269]  He's hanging out with Richard Branson.
[02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:47.431]  Whatever.
[02:37:47.431 --> 02:37:49.232]  You know, he's just too good for us.
[02:37:49.232 --> 02:37:50.813]  Don't you get it?
[02:37:50.813 --> 02:37:54.496]  Obama is just too good for us.
[02:37:54.496 --> 02:37:55.337]  Do you remember the story?
[02:37:57.386 --> 02:38:01.229]  Where they were speculating, what will Obama do?
[02:38:01.229 --> 02:38:03.910]  Obama, he's so great.
[02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:05.471]  What will Obama do?
[02:38:05.471 --> 02:38:07.093]  Maybe he'll be the next leader of the UN.
[02:38:07.093 --> 02:38:07.853]  And you know what they said?
[02:38:07.853 --> 02:38:11.756]  They said, he's too big for that.
[02:38:11.756 --> 02:38:13.377]  He's too big for the UN.
[02:38:13.377 --> 02:38:15.338]  He's bigger than the biggest.
[02:38:15.338 --> 02:38:16.439]  He is so big.
[02:38:16.439 --> 02:38:18.500]  He's such the best.
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:22.123]  There's nothing, there's not even a platform big enough for Obama.
[02:38:24.008 --> 02:38:27.931]  And then the New York Times comes out saying, he's just too good for us.
[02:38:27.931 --> 02:38:30.133]  You know what?
[02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:33.195]  You know what?
[02:38:33.195 --> 02:38:38.420]  I just discovered, I'm gonna have to send someone else out to do this.
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:39.521]  I'm gonna have to share the wealth.
[02:38:39.521 --> 02:38:42.683]  I'm gonna go ahead and put this out there to the crew, everybody listening.
[02:38:42.683 --> 02:38:44.264]  Here's what we have to do.
[02:38:44.264 --> 02:38:48.408]  Here's the challenge, maybe I just do it myself.
[02:38:48.408 --> 02:38:53.412]  We go out on the streets, you do a man on the street and you say, list Obama's accomplishments.
[02:38:54.642 --> 02:38:55.782]  I'm dead serious.
[02:38:55.782 --> 02:38:59.524]  I guarantee you, you could not get people to name Obama's accomplishments.
[02:38:59.524 --> 02:39:05.146]  The biggest Obama fans out there, I guarantee you, could not list Obama's accomplishments.
[02:39:05.146 --> 02:39:07.327]  And yet they say he's too good for us.
[02:39:07.327 --> 02:39:08.608]  Oh, he's too good for us?
[02:39:08.608 --> 02:39:10.148]  What did he do?
[02:39:10.148 --> 02:39:12.950]  What did he accomplish?
[02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:15.891]  The biggest illegal spy campaign in the history of the world?
[02:39:17.625 --> 02:39:20.006]  So that's what we have to do.
[02:39:20.006 --> 02:39:21.166]  We gotta go out and do the report.
[02:39:21.166 --> 02:39:26.488]  So one of the other great reporters that's listening to this, get it ready, get it set up, go do it tomorrow.
[02:39:26.488 --> 02:39:31.149]  Go and find people and see if they can tell you Obama's accomplishments.
[02:39:31.149 --> 02:39:34.030]  But then they'll say he's scandal-free!
[02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:36.651]  Scandal-free president!
[02:39:36.651 --> 02:39:38.551]  Scandal-free president!
[02:39:38.551 --> 02:39:40.192]  This is how it'll go.
[02:39:40.192 --> 02:39:43.953]  You'll say, hello, can you please listen to me list Obama's accomplishments?
[02:39:43.953 --> 02:39:45.093]  They won't be able to.
[02:39:45.093 --> 02:39:46.154]  Here's a whole story
[02:39:47.537 --> 02:39:50.880]  Here's a whole story, a list of... I'm going to do this in the next segment.
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:55.604]  I'm just going to read the whole story of all of Trump's accomplishments.
[02:39:55.604 --> 02:40:00.789]  But I guarantee you, if you challenged an Obama supporter, can you list Obama's accomplishments?
[02:40:00.789 --> 02:40:01.790]  They wouldn't be able to do it.
[02:40:01.790 --> 02:40:05.514]  And then they would say to you, at least he's not a scandal-free president.
[02:40:05.514 --> 02:40:07.796]  He has a book of scandals.
[02:40:07.796 --> 02:40:11.719]  You look at what happened in Libya, folks.
[02:40:11.719 --> 02:40:12.300]  Unbelievable.
[02:40:14.252 --> 02:40:21.823]  But we'll go ahead and read off Trump's accomplishments on the other side, and then we'll have one of our reporters go to a man on the street and ask people to list Obama's accomplishments.
[02:40:21.823 --> 02:40:22.905]  They won't be able to do it.
[02:40:22.905 --> 02:40:29.595]  Now, finally, in the next segment, actually, I won't be able to read all of Trump's accomplishments because...
[02:40:30.834 --> 02:40:32.735]  We've got the video ready to go.
[02:40:32.735 --> 02:40:34.755]  Alex Jones confronts Bernie Sanders at the airport.
[02:40:34.755 --> 02:40:38.016]  Now look, Alex Jones is on a well-deserved vacation.
[02:40:38.016 --> 02:40:41.377]  We literally have to beg him to take a break.
[02:40:41.377 --> 02:40:43.518]  He cannot get away from work.
[02:40:43.518 --> 02:40:48.440]  He is truly committed, and he understands the paramount times we're in.
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:50.940]  So we can't even get him to go on a vacation.
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:56.682]  Finally, he's going on a vacation, and lo and behold, there's Bernie Sanders waiting for him at the LA airport.
[02:40:56.682 --> 02:40:58.483]  So, in the next segment,
[02:40:59.662 --> 02:41:03.666]  We're going to debut Alex Jones confronting Bernie Sanders at the airport.
[02:41:03.666 --> 02:41:14.336]  Now, I've not seen this video yet, however, I'm told that as soon as Bernie Sanders learns that Alex Jones is at the same airport as him, he runs.
[02:41:14.336 --> 02:41:16.198]  He runs.
[02:41:16.198 --> 02:41:17.439]  So, let's see.
[02:41:17.439 --> 02:41:20.362]  What is Bernie Sanders' 40 time?
[02:41:20.362 --> 02:41:23.324]  We're about to find out what Bernie Sanders' 40-yard dash time is.
[02:41:24.246 --> 02:41:27.387]  With his soy boy drinking a soy latte in the background there.
[02:41:27.387 --> 02:41:32.088]  So, Alex Jones confronting Bernie Sanders on the other side of this break.
[02:41:32.088 --> 02:41:38.389]  You're not going to want to miss that as we debut it here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:41.130]  But here's the story.
[02:41:41.130 --> 02:41:42.950]  It's on thegatewaypundit.com.
[02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:47.291]  If it's not relinked on infowars.com, I'm sure it will be by the end of the day.
[02:41:48.669 --> 02:41:54.097]  Complete list of President Trump's historic accomplishments after first 500 days in office.
[02:41:54.097 --> 02:41:57.543]  Well, what did Obama have?
[02:41:57.543 --> 02:41:59.165]  2,000 days in office?
[02:41:59.165 --> 02:41:59.986]  2,000 days in office?
[02:41:59.986 --> 02:42:02.811]  See if you can find a story like this for Obama's accomplishments.
[02:42:04.025 --> 02:42:05.386]  But I'm serious.
[02:42:05.386 --> 02:42:11.913]  We gotta just send someone out to do a man on the street and just see if you can find anybody that can list off Obama's accomplishments.
[02:42:11.913 --> 02:42:13.394]  Just see if you can do that.
[02:42:13.394 --> 02:42:15.477]  I'll just read a couple here in the final 30 seconds.
[02:42:20.982 --> 02:42:21.662]  ...has been elected.
[02:42:21.662 --> 02:42:23.042]  It has skyrocketed.
[02:42:23.042 --> 02:42:29.204]  The Dow broke the record for the fastest 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, and 7,000 point increases between major milestones in the history of the Dow since Trump was elected president.
[02:42:29.204 --> 02:42:33.764]  It had more all-time closing highs in 2017, and the Dow increased more in 2017 than any other year in history.
[02:42:33.764 --> 02:42:34.905]  I'm just getting started here.
[02:42:47.327 --> 02:42:49.593]  More people working at any other time in U.S.
[02:42:49.593 --> 02:42:51.198]  history, including black people.
[02:42:51.198 --> 02:42:52.481]  But where's the media on that?
[02:42:55.242 --> 02:42:58.845]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:58.845 --> 02:43:00.627]  Introducing Pollen Block.

[02:43:12.677 --> 02:43:17.961]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs, if
[02:43:17.961 --> 02:43:18.241]  Let's go!
[02:43:35.515 --> 02:43:37.236]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:37.236 --> 02:43:47.222]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.222 --> 02:43:49.883]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[02:45:56.380 --> 02:46:03.326]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[02:46:03.326 --> 02:46:05.869]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[02:46:05.869 --> 02:46:12.114]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge and the world is taking notice.

[02:46:36.863 --> 02:46:38.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:13.923 --> 02:47:15.124]  You found it.
[02:47:15.124 --> 02:47:16.545]  The tip of the spear.
[02:47:16.545 --> 02:47:24.330]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:47:24.330 --> 02:47:31.836]  What does the cowardly scum enemy of this country do when they see the tip of the spear?
[02:47:34.431 --> 02:47:38.414]  Well they, you know what, they're britches and run the other way.
[02:47:38.414 --> 02:47:48.542]  The latest example has to be Bernie Sanders, who Alex Jones ran into at LA International on his way out of town for vacation.
[02:47:48.542 --> 02:47:51.925]  Unbelievable that this would happen.
[02:47:51.925 --> 02:47:53.206]  And it's really funny to me.
[02:47:54.758 --> 02:48:10.868]  Because Bernie Sanders is a guy who, the real Bernie Sanders supporters, the real informed voters that were pulling for Bernie Sanders, have all disavowed Bernie Sanders and know that he turned out to be a total fraud, a total scum.
[02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:25.358]  And it's just funny to see the total collapse of these people, Sanders, Clinton, Obama, that were lifted up by the left as heroes, that are going to go down as total zeros.
[02:48:25.358 --> 02:48:29.041]  But this is the classic footage, debuting right now on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:29.041 --> 02:48:34.924]  Alex Jones, even when he goes on vacation, the world refuses to let him stop working.
[02:48:34.924 --> 02:48:40.448]  Here's Alex Jones confronting Bernie Sanders, seen for the first time now on the Alex Jones Show at LA International.
[02:48:41.597 --> 02:48:48.699]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[02:48:48.699 --> 02:48:51.020]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:49:13.012 --> 02:49:21.595]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just got off our plane here at LAX and Bernie Sanders, the living embodiment of communist and socialist evil and failure, was here.
[02:49:21.595 --> 02:49:25.857]  A living museum piece of Mao Zedong or Joseph Stalin or V.I.
[02:49:25.857 --> 02:49:26.897]  Lenin.
[02:49:26.897 --> 02:49:30.918]  In fact, after the death of Hugo Chavez, he passed on the mantle.
[02:49:30.918 --> 02:49:35.640]  But of course, his little handlers wouldn't let him talk to some proletariat slave like me.
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:36.921]  And so this went on for a while.
[02:49:36.921 --> 02:49:37.841]  Then he left the gate.
[02:49:38.001 --> 02:49:41.764]  We went to a little store, he came back by and we talked to him again.
[02:49:41.764 --> 02:49:49.210]  But then his minions came over and put out the same old Democratic talking points they do over and over and over again.
[02:49:49.210 --> 02:49:52.873]  You talk about brainwashed sheep, you're going to see some of those as well.
[02:49:52.873 --> 02:49:53.714]  So here it is.
[02:49:53.714 --> 02:49:59.139]  Well, they didn't know Bernie Sanders.
[02:50:00.282 --> 02:50:02.464]  Dude, no, come on, not right now.
[02:50:02.464 --> 02:50:03.505]  No, send her.
[02:50:03.505 --> 02:50:11.050]  Why'd you say white people didn't know what it was like before?
[02:50:11.050 --> 02:50:12.812]  Let me guess, you guys aren't flying first class, are you?
[02:50:12.812 --> 02:50:19.897]  Why's he running?
[02:50:19.897 --> 02:50:20.618]  I don't know why.
[02:50:20.618 --> 02:50:22.680]  I guess if he's flying first class, he shouldn't be.
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:25.802]  Radio audience, security guards are standing in front of Alex now.
[02:50:25.802 --> 02:50:26.703]  I like his $100,000 alimony.
[02:50:26.703 --> 02:50:27.804]  I'm gonna walk this way.
[02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:29.481]  Don't touch me.
[02:50:29.481 --> 02:50:30.482]  You just hit me, bro.
[02:50:30.482 --> 02:50:31.482]  You put your hand out, Alex.
[02:50:31.482 --> 02:50:34.145]  Oh, you're gonna do that socialist thing where you like bump into people and say that?
[02:50:34.145 --> 02:50:36.086]  Alex, I'm walking back.
[02:50:36.086 --> 02:50:38.909]  Hey, Bernie.
[02:50:38.909 --> 02:50:42.432]  Bernie, why are you running, bro?
[02:50:42.432 --> 02:50:44.273]  Yeah, we, uh... Karl Rove didn't run like this.
[02:50:44.273 --> 02:50:45.174]  He always talked to me.
[02:50:45.174 --> 02:50:45.675]  I'll talk to you.
[02:50:46.684 --> 02:50:48.045]  Do you want to have a conversation?
[02:50:48.045 --> 02:50:50.285]  Well, he said, why do people know what it's like to be poor?
[02:50:50.285 --> 02:50:51.406]  This is why people are poor.
[02:50:51.406 --> 02:50:53.387]  He said, why do people know what it's like to be poor?
[02:50:53.387 --> 02:50:55.707]  I thought it was a really racist thing to say.
[02:50:55.707 --> 02:51:00.689]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[02:51:00.689 --> 02:51:03.370]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:51:03.370 --> 02:51:09.493]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.
[02:51:09.493 --> 02:51:13.394]  You guys are so afraid of stuff.
[02:51:13.394 --> 02:51:14.935]  Wow, Bernie Sanders runs from all chance.
[02:51:17.722 --> 02:51:19.643]  Don't worry.
[02:51:19.643 --> 02:51:21.204]  Get my beautiful face on camera.
[02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:21.724]  Don't worry.
[02:51:21.724 --> 02:51:24.025]  We'll destroy America.
[02:51:24.025 --> 02:51:27.727]  We'll turn it into Venezuela.
[02:51:27.727 --> 02:51:28.887]  Don't worry.
[02:51:28.887 --> 02:51:36.811]  Bernie, why did you say white people don't know what white people are?
[02:51:36.811 --> 02:51:37.392]  Don't touch me.
[02:51:37.392 --> 02:51:38.893]  Alex, don't touch me.
[02:51:38.893 --> 02:51:40.133]  Don't touch me, Alex.
[02:51:40.133 --> 02:51:41.974]  You guys have fun.
[02:51:41.974 --> 02:51:43.555]  Gotta be around the general public, huh?
[02:51:43.555 --> 02:51:45.456]  It's kind of a bad thing.
[02:51:46.724 --> 02:51:48.065]  You're in the proletariat like that?
[02:51:48.065 --> 02:51:49.366]  You're ruling class commie?
[02:51:49.366 --> 02:51:50.266]  Huh?
[02:51:59.377 --> 02:52:00.037]  You're having fun.
[02:52:00.037 --> 02:52:01.518]  We're all having fun, aren't we?
[02:52:01.518 --> 02:52:02.138]  We're gonna win.
[02:52:02.138 --> 02:52:02.538]  Don't worry.
[02:52:02.538 --> 02:52:03.499]  America's coming back.
[02:52:03.499 --> 02:52:05.980]  A real liberal ideologue would actually talk to Alex.
[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.720]  That shows you how fake Sanders is.
[02:52:07.720 --> 02:52:09.421]  Have a good one.
[02:52:09.421 --> 02:52:13.523]  The truth is, the left is the most vicious, evil ideology the planet's ever seen.
[02:52:13.523 --> 02:52:14.743]  It's a historical fact.
[02:52:14.743 --> 02:52:17.044]  They always lecture us how we're violent, we're bad.
[02:52:17.044 --> 02:52:18.625]  They're the ones that want to abort all the babies.
[02:52:18.625 --> 02:52:21.826]  They're the ones that wanted to block Trump being able to have all the experimental
[02:52:22.686 --> 02:52:26.169]  Cures and treatments given to people that were terminal.
[02:52:26.169 --> 02:52:27.750]  They're the people that love the culture of death.
[02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:30.412]  Just like Bernie supported Black Lives Matter.
[02:52:30.412 --> 02:52:34.416]  Just like he wouldn't decry the cop killers when they killed cops.
[02:52:34.416 --> 02:52:38.399]  That's the type of monster, cold-blooded person that Sanders is.
[02:52:38.399 --> 02:52:41.181]  He wants to overthrow this country via conquest.
[02:52:41.181 --> 02:52:43.523]  Bernie Sanders is a monster.
[02:52:47.126 --> 02:52:47.326]  Okay.
[02:52:47.326 --> 02:52:48.347]  20 minutes later now.
[02:52:48.347 --> 02:52:51.670]  Mr. Sanders, why do you think socialism works better than capitalism?
[02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:54.593]  And why do you live in a capitalist country?
[02:52:54.593 --> 02:52:57.616]  I don't know why you're running from me.
[02:52:57.616 --> 02:52:58.597]  Where are you flying today?
[02:52:58.597 --> 02:53:01.119]  You're going to apologize to the Sandy Hook family, Alex?
[02:53:01.119 --> 02:53:02.741]  Well, that's the media misrepresents that.
[02:53:02.741 --> 02:53:03.161]  That's that.
[02:53:03.161 --> 02:53:06.064]  You apologize for all the wars you guys launched, the Democrats?
[02:53:06.064 --> 02:53:06.885]  All the millions you killed?
[02:53:08.137 --> 02:53:10.939]  Do you enjoy living in your million-dollar vacation houses, Bernie?
[02:53:10.939 --> 02:53:13.140]  Or do you want to give those to people?
[02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:20.083]  Yeah, your $100,000 Audis?
[02:53:20.083 --> 02:53:21.904]  Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[02:53:21.904 --> 02:53:22.665]  You guys have fun.
[02:53:22.665 --> 02:53:27.347]  We love reporting on all that money.
[02:53:27.347 --> 02:53:28.528]  You guys running a little PR stuff.
[02:53:28.528 --> 02:53:31.770]  It's not going to work.
[02:53:31.770 --> 02:53:32.370]  Have fun, you know.
[02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:38.672]  Good luck when Google gets broken up.
[02:53:38.672 --> 02:53:40.353]  Apologize to the San Diego cameras, Alex.
[02:53:40.353 --> 02:53:41.815]  You guys need to.
[02:53:41.815 --> 02:53:42.075]  Right?
[02:53:42.075 --> 02:53:44.517]  You made those places victimless armadillos.
[02:53:44.517 --> 02:53:45.218]  And advertise them.
[02:53:46.141 --> 02:53:49.543]  What do you think about the fact that 98% of mass shootings occur in gun-free zones?
[02:53:49.543 --> 02:53:53.304]  Bernie, do you want to get rid of those?
[02:53:53.304 --> 02:53:57.446]  Now you have Bernie Sanders minions pretending to be a security guy.
[02:53:57.446 --> 02:53:58.026]  This is insane.
[02:53:58.026 --> 02:54:00.127]  I imagine you're a Sandy Hook denier.
[02:54:00.127 --> 02:54:02.408]  You guys are religious.
[02:54:02.408 --> 02:54:03.088]  Who's my guy?
[02:54:03.088 --> 02:54:03.949]  What guy am I?
[02:54:03.949 --> 02:54:05.009]  I mean, you like Hillary.
[02:54:05.009 --> 02:54:06.030]  What guy am I?
[02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.890]  No, you like Hillary.
[02:54:06.890 --> 02:54:07.751]  Did I bring up Hillary?
[02:54:10.505 --> 02:54:15.190]  You deny Sandy Hook, and you're giving him a hard time.
[02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:16.951]  Can we just pause it real quick?
[02:54:16.951 --> 02:54:19.053]  I just have to explain something to the radio audience here.
[02:54:19.053 --> 02:54:22.236]  They do this every time.
[02:54:22.236 --> 02:54:28.102]  They get in your face, and they stand there, and they rub up against you, and they bump up against you, and they say, oh, I'm just standing here.
[02:54:28.102 --> 02:54:29.283]  And it's like, no you're not!
[02:54:29.283 --> 02:54:33.007]  If you did this anywhere else, if you did this at a concert, at a sporting event, at a movie theater,
[02:54:33.667 --> 02:54:35.448]  The guy should punch you in the face!
[02:54:35.448 --> 02:54:37.589]  And I'm getting sick of this crap, man!
[02:54:37.589 --> 02:54:39.530]  I'm getting sick of these people!
[02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:41.672]  These people are perverts, dude!
[02:54:41.672 --> 02:54:48.195]  So just go back, now you've got these people at the airport that are now pretending to be Bernie's security and bumping up against Alex Jones here.
[02:54:48.195 --> 02:54:49.376]  Go back to the video.
[02:54:49.376 --> 02:54:51.077]  You edited tapes of Sandy Hook.
[02:54:51.077 --> 02:54:52.098]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:54:52.098 --> 02:54:52.578]  You're an idiot.
[02:54:52.578 --> 02:54:52.918]  You win.
[02:54:52.918 --> 02:54:56.620]  Why don't you talk about all the wars and stuff that's killed millions of people?
[02:54:56.620 --> 02:55:00.803]  Or Hillary launching the whole thing in Libya and destabilizing the whole country instead of feeling good about yourself?
[02:55:02.490 --> 02:55:04.171]  You're a virtuous signaler.
[02:55:04.171 --> 02:55:06.714]  Yeah, so... What about the troops that died there?
[02:55:06.714 --> 02:55:09.337]  Do you know how Benghazi, Hillary were to stand there?
[02:55:09.337 --> 02:55:11.439]  Anyway, it looks like minions to come.
[02:55:11.439 --> 02:55:12.300]  You guys are losing.
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:15.923]  The world's awake to socialism and all the so-called elite intelligentsia that run it.
[02:55:15.923 --> 02:55:18.125]  They're totally awake to it.
[02:55:18.125 --> 02:55:18.866]  Hell yeah.
[02:55:18.866 --> 02:55:21.369]  They get what's going on everywhere.
[02:55:21.369 --> 02:55:22.790]  Just showing that that's who you are.
[02:55:24.298 --> 02:55:26.440]  Anyways, I gotta go catch my flight.
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:28.041]  You guys have a great day.
[02:55:28.041 --> 02:55:28.361]  Please.
[02:55:28.361 --> 02:55:29.322]  One less idiot in L.A.
[02:55:29.322 --> 02:55:30.463]  is good.
[02:55:30.463 --> 02:55:31.444]  No?
[02:55:31.444 --> 02:55:32.325]  Well, L.A.'
[02:55:32.305 --> 02:55:33.766]  's trying to hit their idiot max.
[02:55:33.766 --> 02:55:37.369]  I'm not sure who one of them is.
[02:55:37.369 --> 02:55:43.294]  Hey, Bernie, why'd you say white people don't always like to be poor?
[02:55:43.294 --> 02:55:44.655]  Why are you so racist?
[02:55:44.655 --> 02:55:47.197]  I won't answer that, but he did say it.
[02:55:48.998 --> 02:55:50.439]  Move to Venezuela, Bernie.
[02:55:50.439 --> 02:55:51.140]  You'll like it.
[02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:53.782]  People like you there.
[02:55:53.782 --> 02:56:01.267]  So over and over again, they want to change the subject from communism and socialism destroying hundreds of countries and killing over 200 million people.
[02:56:01.267 --> 02:56:08.391]  They want to change the subject to myself and others asking questions about big public events that are used to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:56:08.391 --> 02:56:09.592]  This is incredible.
[02:56:09.592 --> 02:56:12.774]  But as long as they can't guilt you into their mind control, they fail.
[02:56:12.774 --> 02:56:16.537]  They are sociopaths and psychopaths, leftists and globalists.
[02:56:16.957 --> 02:56:19.038]  Are there to manipulate those of us that have feelings?
[02:56:19.038 --> 02:56:27.762]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, Bernie Sanders checked off the bucket list, running like a cowardly rat into a sewer, away from serious questions.
[02:56:27.762 --> 02:56:32.745]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[02:56:32.745 --> 02:56:37.027]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:56:37.027 --> 02:56:41.489]  Says the Jewish senator.
[02:56:41.489 --> 02:56:42.650]  You know, folks, first of all,
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:56.711]  Just watching that video, there's a couple things that you're going to notice, but just right off the bat, you know, whatever your political leanings are,
[02:56:58.427 --> 02:57:00.309]  Do you still have a soul?
[02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:03.992]  Do you still have the ability to recognize a soul?
[02:57:03.992 --> 02:57:06.153]  Do you still have a spirit?
[02:57:06.153 --> 02:57:11.998]  You just look in Bernie's eyes and you can just see the elitism.
[02:57:11.998 --> 02:57:14.040]  You can just see the emptiness.
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:15.641]  You can see the fraud.
[02:57:15.641 --> 02:57:18.383]  You can see the phoniness.
[02:57:18.383 --> 02:57:20.425]  It just eeks out of him.
[02:57:20.425 --> 02:57:22.507]  The phoniness, the fraud, the cowardness.
[02:57:24.406 --> 02:57:25.807]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:57:25.807 --> 02:57:30.011]  That is your communist, socialist, democrat leader?
[02:57:30.011 --> 02:57:30.792]  Yeah, it is!
[02:57:30.792 --> 02:57:32.094]  A total coward!
[02:57:32.094 --> 02:57:33.535]  A total snake!
[02:57:33.535 --> 02:57:35.036]  A total elitist!
[02:57:35.036 --> 02:57:36.778]  A total fraud!
[02:57:36.778 --> 02:57:37.439]  But you know what?
[02:57:37.439 --> 02:57:42.504]  Again, the real educated voters that went for Bernie now know he's a fraud.
[02:57:42.504 --> 02:57:43.745]  So, you didn't get away with it.
[02:57:45.458 --> 02:57:49.120]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.

[02:59:49.321 --> 02:59:51.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:03.406 --> 03:00:10.469]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:13.751]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:19.304 --> 03:00:23.691]  Alright, I've got some things I just need to get out there before Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:00:23.691 --> 03:00:28.437]  But, you know, I was discussing with the crew after we watched that Bernie Sanders video.
[03:00:28.437 --> 03:00:34.226]  I mean, again, there's so many little weird aspects of it.
[03:00:34.226 --> 03:00:34.807]  Like, one...
[03:00:36.148 --> 03:00:37.529]  Remember how popular Bernie was?
[03:00:37.529 --> 03:00:39.049]  Like, he was actually popular.
[03:00:39.049 --> 03:00:45.131]  He actually had rallies that had people showing up, unlike Hillary Clinton, who couldn't even get people to show up at a rally with LeBron James at it.
[03:00:45.131 --> 03:00:50.553]  I mean, literally, they had to pay for people to go to her rallies to get people to show up, and they still didn't.
[03:00:50.553 --> 03:00:53.954]  But here's Bernie Sanders at the airport, and nobody seems to even care!
[03:00:55.031 --> 03:00:57.132]  So that's what I'm telling you.
[03:00:57.132 --> 03:00:58.492]  Bernie's not cool anymore.
[03:00:58.492 --> 03:01:09.735]  The whole Bernie everything facade died when he sold all of his voters down the drain by endorsing Hillary Clinton.
[03:01:09.735 --> 03:01:13.056]  And by not standing up against the rigged primaries.
[03:01:13.056 --> 03:01:19.558]  So there's Bernie Sanders, the huge face of the Democrat Socialist Party, the big popular
[03:01:21.627 --> 03:01:22.628]  Socialist!
[03:01:22.628 --> 03:01:24.109]  Not even popular at the airport.
[03:01:24.109 --> 03:01:26.130]  Nobody even cares.
[03:01:26.130 --> 03:01:30.394]  Alex Jones gets more attention at an airport than Bernie Sanders.
[03:01:30.394 --> 03:01:36.098]  And then you have his little soy boy security staff there trying to have their moment in the sun.
[03:01:36.098 --> 03:01:41.082]  But again, you can just see and sense the elitism on Bernie's face.
[03:01:41.082 --> 03:01:43.984]  You can see he's a total coward.
[03:01:43.984 --> 03:01:45.085]  But think about it again.
[03:01:48.783 --> 03:01:50.345]  This is how low energy he is.
[03:01:50.345 --> 03:01:56.652]  Like, there's a certain... There's certain immeasurable characteristics of humans.
[03:01:56.652 --> 03:01:57.453]  Okay?
[03:01:57.453 --> 03:01:58.975]  Energy is one of them.
[03:01:58.975 --> 03:02:01.217]  Bernie Sanders is low energy.
[03:02:02.594 --> 03:02:06.735]  Donald Trump walks into an airport, the entire airport can feel it.
[03:02:06.735 --> 03:02:16.859]  On the opposite side of the airport, a totally different wing that you'd have to take a train or monorail over to get to can feel Donald Trump in the airport.
[03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:21.000]  You're in the same restaurant as Bernie Sanders, you don't even know or care he's there.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:24.181]  That's how low energy Bernie is, but I digress.
[03:02:25.188 --> 03:02:38.096]  Now, do you remember the story I already covered about the city in Massachusetts, Kemsford, saying that you could not have American flags displayed in the lawn of a business?
[03:02:38.096 --> 03:02:40.317]  Well, I explained why that was.
[03:02:40.317 --> 03:02:47.402]  Because the liberals are freaking out right now, not just about American symbolism that triggers them, because they say racist or this or that.
[03:02:48.775 --> 03:02:54.136]  But it's the reality setting in that it's actually popular.
[03:02:54.136 --> 03:02:57.977]  For example, look at Kaia Jones, former member of the Pussycat Dolls.
[03:02:57.977 --> 03:03:01.697]  She's the only one of any of the Pussycat Dolls that still has a career.
[03:03:01.697 --> 03:03:02.917]  Why does she have a career?
[03:03:02.917 --> 03:03:05.618]  Because she came out for Trump.
[03:03:05.618 --> 03:03:06.798]  And that's just one example.
[03:03:06.798 --> 03:03:08.078]  How about this one?
[03:03:08.078 --> 03:03:14.899]  Top seven songs on Apple Music and Spotify are all Kanye West.
[03:03:14.899 --> 03:03:18.040]  Oh, how's that Kanye West boycott going?
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:18.380]  Failed.
[03:03:19.724 --> 03:03:25.357]  Now Kanye West coming out with a new album, naturally he's gonna have some top songs, but top 7?
[03:03:25.357 --> 03:03:28.825]  If you don't understand the correlation between what Kanye West is doing...
[03:03:30.762 --> 03:03:36.506]  To talk about political free speech and the top album sales, then you just don't get it.
[03:03:36.506 --> 03:03:42.170]  If you don't understand why the left freaks out about 200 American flags in a lawn, you just don't get it.
[03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:43.992]  It all ties into the same thing.
[03:03:43.992 --> 03:03:46.213]  Patriotism is back!
[03:03:46.213 --> 03:03:52.578]  And they want to cast a shadow over it, like it's racist, or like it's only for this group of people.
[03:03:52.578 --> 03:03:53.279]  No!
[03:03:53.279 --> 03:03:54.680]  It's everyone!
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:56.081]  That's what's freaking them out!
[03:03:57.202 --> 03:03:57.943]  It doesn't matter.
[03:03:57.943 --> 03:04:02.729]  We don't care what color your skin is, your race, your color, your creed, or anything.
[03:04:02.729 --> 03:04:03.951]  We're all in this together.
[03:04:03.951 --> 03:04:05.292]  We realize this.
[03:04:05.292 --> 03:04:06.935]  We know what made America great.
[03:04:08.149 --> 03:04:15.715]  You're trying to stomp on all the things that made America great and label them as racist, label them as bigoted, label them as this, that, but the other thing.
[03:04:15.715 --> 03:04:21.699]  And someone like Kanye West just comes out and says, hey look, why don't we just think for ourselves?
[03:04:21.699 --> 03:04:30.046]  Hey, I don't have to do much research to find out that Barack Obama for eight years as president did nothing for the city of Chicago, which by the way is Kanye West's home.
[03:04:30.962 --> 03:04:41.626]  So, the left freaks out when they realize America, patriotism, nationalism, and Trump is popular, is breaking the matrix.
[03:04:41.626 --> 03:04:48.129]  So they freak out, label it all of these things, try to censor it, but they can't accept the fact they're losing.
[03:04:48.129 --> 03:04:50.850]  So just keep losing, liberals.
[03:04:50.850 --> 03:04:52.971]  Just keep losing and pretend like you're winning.
[03:04:54.332 --> 03:04:58.294]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.294 --> 03:05:01.575]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.575 --> 03:05:07.838]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.838 --> 03:05:10.620]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:15.185]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.185 --> 03:05:21.653]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.653 --> 03:05:26.618]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.355 --> 03:05:31.277]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.277 --> 03:05:38.481]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.481 --> 03:05:43.183]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.183 --> 03:05:49.387]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.387 --> 03:05:53.369]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:20.174 --> 03:06:28.222]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:28.222 --> 03:06:31.365]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones right now.
[03:06:31.365 --> 03:06:37.971]  I've got a couple of stories here and then I'm going to tee it up for Matt Bracken to take over from enemiesforeignanddomestic.com.
[03:06:37.971 --> 03:06:41.835]  Simon Cowell has not had his mobile phone for 10 months.
[03:06:41.835 --> 03:06:43.377]  You know, I just wanted to comment on this real quick.
[03:06:45.066 --> 03:06:51.067]  I have had different times recently where I've either lost my mobile phone or just not had it.
[03:06:51.067 --> 03:07:01.670]  And there's a weird climax where after like two days or three days, like you still feel lost without it, you're still reaching it for your pocket and everything, you're still getting the phantom vibrate.
[03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:08.812]  But then once you hit like day four and five, it's like the most liberating, freeing thing ever.
[03:07:08.812 --> 03:07:13.193]  But in today's world, in today's age, people just don't think they can live without it.
[03:07:13.193 --> 03:07:14.353]  So it's just interesting.
[03:07:15.578 --> 03:07:16.459]  And then what do we do?
[03:07:16.459 --> 03:07:22.788]  Do we commit to not using the smartphones, to pushing against that technology now as they roll out the AI?
[03:07:22.788 --> 03:07:24.851]  That battle is in front of us.
[03:07:24.851 --> 03:07:26.794]  Now this is actually an incredible story for two reasons.
[03:07:26.794 --> 03:07:31.100]  Swimmer faces Shark's massive garbage patch on record Pacific Crossing.
[03:07:31.100 --> 03:07:31.981]  So first I say...
[03:07:32.862 --> 03:07:47.170]  You literally have floating islands of trash, literal trash, in the ocean, and somehow it gets no attention from the people that, you know, cry climate change, man-made climate change all day, with nothing
[03:07:48.263 --> 03:07:52.325]  With nothing but made-up formulas to prove it.
[03:07:52.325 --> 03:07:53.026]  No science.
[03:07:53.026 --> 03:07:57.709]  But you have literal islands of trash floating around and it seems to get no attention from liberals.
[03:07:57.709 --> 03:07:58.629]  I don't know this guy's politics.
[03:07:58.629 --> 03:08:01.050]  He probably is a liberal, but he's facing the real thing.
[03:08:01.050 --> 03:08:06.754]  But then he's talking about how he's also using this to make himself better and push his own limits.
[03:08:06.754 --> 03:08:15.719]  He's planning on swimming under the entire island as big as Texas and doing studies underwater for that time.
[03:08:15.719 --> 03:08:17.000]  So that's going to be kind of incredible.
[03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:24.155]  Box office Han Solo loses $30 million in second weekend.
[03:08:24.155 --> 03:08:31.201]  Yeah, this is just greedy Hollywood trying to milk the name Star Wars for everything they can, and they're actually killing the brand.
[03:08:31.201 --> 03:08:36.326]  Episode 9 will have a better return, but after that it'll probably be dead.
[03:08:36.326 --> 03:08:37.287]  This was just brought to me.
[03:08:37.287 --> 03:08:42.291]  InfoWars livestreams a Planned Parenthood protest the day after anniversary of Dr. Tiller's murder.
[03:08:45.595 --> 03:08:47.777]  I don't even know what this is about.
[03:08:47.777 --> 03:08:50.599]  They think that I planned it that way here at Media Matters.
[03:08:50.599 --> 03:08:52.821]  Well, I can assure you that's not the case.
[03:08:52.821 --> 03:08:57.986]  But thank you, Media Matters, for highlighting our protest of the Baby Killers Planned Parenthood.
[03:08:57.986 --> 03:08:59.067]  Thank you very much.
[03:08:59.067 --> 03:09:06.233]  Now, also include the fact that Margaret Sanger spoke to the KKK multiple times at KKK events and was a known eugenicist.
[03:09:07.557 --> 03:09:12.760]  So thank you, Media Matters, for reporting on our protest against the slaughter of innocent children.
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:15.302]  Thank you so much, Media Matters.
[03:09:15.302 --> 03:09:20.505]  All right, but now I'm going to pitch it to Matt Bracken, who knows a lot about preparedness.
[03:09:20.505 --> 03:09:25.167]  And I'm not sure where Matt wants to go today, but I'm going to pitch it to him with putting this on a tee.
[03:09:25.167 --> 03:09:31.111]  You've got Guatemala has a massive volcano eruption, hundreds injured, 25 killed.
[03:09:31.111 --> 03:09:32.172]  You've got record
[03:09:33.012 --> 03:09:36.234]  Earthquakes on the big island of Hawaii.
[03:09:36.234 --> 03:09:41.777]  You've got fissures and volcanoes breaking out in Hawaii as well.
[03:09:41.777 --> 03:09:43.538]  Now, you're someone that knows about preparedness.
[03:09:43.538 --> 03:09:48.741]  I don't know so much about, you know, the natural disaster side of things, but I just wanted to pitch it to you with that.
[03:09:48.741 --> 03:09:56.485]  Or, heck, maybe you want to get into the biblical nature of this stuff and, you know, the stuff we face in the future with the biblical nature of it.
[03:09:57.105 --> 03:09:58.325]  Nonetheless, I step aside.
[03:09:58.325 --> 03:10:00.286]  Matt Bracken takes over for the fourth hour.
[03:10:00.286 --> 03:10:02.547]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[03:10:02.547 --> 03:10:04.807]  Now, Matt Bracken takes over the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:04.807 --> 03:10:05.307]  I step away.
[03:10:05.307 --> 03:10:08.748]  You stay classy, InfoWarriors.
[03:10:08.748 --> 03:10:10.189]  Thanks, Owen.
[03:10:10.189 --> 03:10:14.390]  You know, it's funny, just the last topics you were talking about.
[03:10:14.390 --> 03:10:21.472]  I actually saw the fires on the Big Island, and that was in 1999.
[03:10:21.472 --> 03:10:24.553]  It was even going then, but at a much smaller, lower level.
[03:10:25.342 --> 03:10:28.304]  Right down in the bottom corner of the Big Island.
[03:10:28.304 --> 03:10:39.310]  And I sailed out of Hilo, which is on the east side, sailed around the south corner of the Big Island, and by that time it was dark and I could actually see the lava from the ocean.
[03:10:39.310 --> 03:10:47.394]  And as far as the floating garbage patch the size of Texas, I want to see some satellite or drone footage.
[03:10:48.137 --> 03:11:00.782]  I've crossed the Atlantic and the Pacific in summer times and been trapped in the giant highs, which are sort of the center of the entire circulatory system, where you literally can have to motor sometimes for weeks.
[03:11:00.782 --> 03:11:02.583]  There's just no wind.
[03:11:02.583 --> 03:11:08.946]  And I've seen some trash patches, but nothing, you know, you would measure it in acres, not square miles.
[03:11:10.473 --> 03:11:19.377]  However, you know, I guess anything's possible and it's been 15 years or so since I've done anything in the middle of the Pacific or Atlantic.
[03:11:19.377 --> 03:11:25.480]  Anyway, as far as everybody carrying their smartphones and giving them up, it's a lot easier.
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:27.561]  Just don't get a smartphone.
[03:11:27.561 --> 03:11:31.343]  For maybe less than $10 a month, you can carry a burner phone.
[03:11:33.328 --> 03:11:39.453]  You know, just treat them like a tool that you pick up off the table and take with you or maybe somebody else carries it.
[03:11:39.453 --> 03:11:42.935]  You swap them around, makes you a little bit less trackable.
[03:11:42.935 --> 03:11:57.266]  You can still do the emergency stuff, but you're not going to be, you know, sitting there like an addict 24 hours a day staring at the thing because you can't not look at Twitter or you can't not look at Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.
[03:11:57.266 --> 03:12:01.710]  So it's a good way to chill out on the social media and just let it go.
[03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:02.831]  Don't have a smartphone.
[03:12:03.365 --> 03:12:04.947]  There's a solution.
[03:12:04.947 --> 03:12:07.709]  Save money, save your mind.
[03:12:07.709 --> 03:12:15.917]  Anyway, the main topic I want to talk to talk about today, and this is directed at Americans, of course, but also to the UK audience.
[03:12:15.917 --> 03:12:25.506]  I know we have quite a following over there behind the what I call the PC curtain in Britannia stand and in in occupied Europe.
[03:12:26.331 --> 03:12:27.952]  There's not much freedom locally.
[03:12:27.952 --> 03:12:30.193]  You can't go to your own newspapers.
[03:12:30.193 --> 03:12:35.496]  They won't cover stories, especially after these denotices last week on Tommy Robinson.
[03:12:35.496 --> 03:12:38.197]  The media are being very, very cautious.
[03:12:38.197 --> 03:12:44.881]  People are afraid to even retweet or share social media stories, but they will look at them.
[03:12:44.881 --> 03:12:52.525]  So I sort of feel like I'm Radio Free Britain here, broadcasting into the occupied zone.
[03:12:53.208 --> 03:13:01.733]  Where people will be listening, but afraid to share because they're afraid that their police might come knocking on their door, which literally happens to people there.
[03:13:01.733 --> 03:13:12.820]  There are some social media videos, YouTube bit shoot, that show people having their doors busted down by the police for things that they've said on social media.
[03:13:12.820 --> 03:13:15.162]  It's really pretty sad and disgusting.
[03:13:16.010 --> 03:13:21.252]  I know at this point a lot of Americans will say and they'll think, well those Brits get what they deserve.
[03:13:21.252 --> 03:13:26.153]  We kicked them out in 76, we're the macho guys, we're the real warriors.
[03:13:26.153 --> 03:13:28.253]  They're a bunch of sissies.
[03:13:28.253 --> 03:13:29.474]  You can't look at it that way.
[03:13:29.474 --> 03:13:31.815]  They're the canary in our coal mine.
[03:13:31.815 --> 03:13:35.155]  Where Britain is now, we'll be in 10 years.
[03:13:35.155 --> 03:13:41.877]  It's not like they showed up one day, this invasion, and landed on a D-Day type invasion beach.
[03:13:41.877 --> 03:13:43.918]  This is slow motion and incremental.
[03:13:44.634 --> 03:13:58.437]  And the same thing is happening here, and if you don't believe me, look at Portland, Maine, or Minneapolis, or Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where mega mosques are going up, with the full cooperation of the local elites.
[03:13:58.437 --> 03:14:05.358]  And toward that end, over the last week, I actually wrote a poem, if you can imagine.
[03:14:05.358 --> 03:14:13.080]  And it's about a two-minute poem I'm going to read when I have a block of time where I can get that done.
[03:14:13.080 --> 03:14:14.180]  But believe me, trust me,
[03:14:15.194 --> 03:14:17.475]  Our elites are selling us out.
[03:14:17.475 --> 03:14:23.678]  They're doing it in England, they're doing it in France and Sweden, and they're doing it right here at home.
[03:14:23.678 --> 03:14:34.543]  And we'd better wise up and see this for what it is, because if we don't, we're going to get beyond the point of no return, which is practically where Britain is today.
[03:14:34.543 --> 03:14:38.565]  And that's with only 5% Islamic population.
[03:14:38.565 --> 03:14:44.408]  At 5%, they start acting in a very bullying manner and voting as a bloc, which means that
[03:14:45.346 --> 03:14:49.229]  That politicians will pander to them no matter what.
[03:14:49.229 --> 03:15:04.338]  In Britain already there are something like, you know, 300 Sharia courts where women who are beaten by their husbands can be taken instead of to an actual, you know, English courtroom where they're told, well, you just have to obey your husband.
[03:15:04.338 --> 03:15:05.979]  He won't beat you anymore.
[03:15:05.979 --> 03:15:07.520]  That's the state of Britain today.
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:09.382]  It's sad and pathetic.
[03:15:09.382 --> 03:15:14.425]  And the worst of it is what's happening to Tommy Robinson, who's right now in prison.
[03:15:15.046 --> 03:15:18.808]  For standing on a street outside of a court with a smartphone.
[03:15:18.808 --> 03:15:25.011]  For that, he was dragged off in a paddy wagon, not to be heard of or seen since then.
[03:15:25.011 --> 03:15:32.475]  So, when we come back, I'm going to read this sort of Rudyard Kipling-style poem that I wrote.
[03:15:32.475 --> 03:15:42.620]  And I'm not sure if my break is coming up here soon, but we'll kick it into the break now.
[03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:43.841]  And I'll see you on the other side.

[03:18:59.591 --> 03:19:00.152]  Thanks for calling.
[03:19:00.152 --> 03:19:01.574]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:19:01.574 --> 03:19:05.198]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:19:05.198 --> 03:19:13.948]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[03:19:14.068 --> 03:19:30.204]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[03:19:30.724 --> 03:19:39.311]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:19:39.311 --> 03:19:44.215]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:19:44.215 --> 03:19:49.819]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[03:19:57.322 --> 03:20:10.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.756 --> 03:20:13.399]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:20:13.399 --> 03:20:16.061]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[03:20:16.061 --> 03:20:18.384]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:20:24.034 --> 03:20:25.315]  Okay, thanks.
[03:20:25.315 --> 03:20:26.555]  We're back.
[03:20:26.555 --> 03:20:31.738]  Over the last week, I've been following what's been happening in Great Britain very closely.
[03:20:31.738 --> 03:20:51.968]  It's really amazing to think that the leader of, you might call it the Freedom Movement, the Make Britain Great Again movement, formerly the English Defense League, now an independent journalist, one of the few voices willing to tell the truth to power in that country, was picked up off the street for having a smartphone
[03:20:52.796 --> 03:21:07.904]  While in public outside of a courthouse where 20 some Muslim men were being tried for continually raping, addicting, raping, torturing young British girls.
[03:21:07.904 --> 03:21:10.846]  And it's Tommy Robinson winds up in prison.
[03:21:10.846 --> 03:21:13.207]  A four minute trial and 13 months in jail.
[03:21:14.065 --> 03:21:25.774]  Hasn't been seen in more than a week, so you have to assume he might have been roughed up somewhat, and they don't want to, you know, any more of these pictures of him like the last time, you know, with the black eyes and the broken nose.
[03:21:25.774 --> 03:21:29.157]  That's what they do in Britain.
[03:21:29.157 --> 03:21:33.401]  It's right out of a clockwork orange, but with an Islamic twist.
[03:21:33.401 --> 03:21:42.508]  So this all motivated me to write a poem, sort of a Rudyard Kipling poem, and I dedicate this to Tommy Robinson and all British patriots.
[03:21:43.291 --> 03:21:45.993]  You'll hear a few references in here.
[03:21:45.993 --> 03:21:56.539]  Kipling, Enoch Powell, Winston Churchill, they all wrote very honestly and frankly about Islam and the danger of Islam.
[03:21:56.539 --> 03:22:02.463]  Today, those British heroes could not be published, could not be read in public.
[03:22:02.463 --> 03:22:03.744]  And here's the poem.
[03:22:03.744 --> 03:22:07.086]  I call it, Patriots, Traitors and Invaders.
[03:22:08.806 --> 03:22:11.568]  Here's a tale of quizzling traders.
[03:22:11.568 --> 03:22:14.329]  Sold their country to invaders.
[03:22:14.329 --> 03:22:17.051]  The first was shot in 45.
[03:22:17.051 --> 03:22:19.953]  But many more are still alive.
[03:22:19.953 --> 03:22:22.254]  When was there a referendum?
[03:22:22.254 --> 03:22:25.256]  Ere our traders thought to send them.
[03:22:25.256 --> 03:22:27.998]  Rivers of blood would be the cost.
[03:22:27.998 --> 03:22:29.359]  Enoch was right.
[03:22:29.359 --> 03:22:31.700]  Now Britain's lost.
[03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:33.161]  Bombs and bullets.
[03:22:33.161 --> 03:22:34.962]  Acid and knives.
[03:22:34.962 --> 03:22:37.544]  Vans on pavements, destroying lives.
[03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:41.771]  Showing rape gangs now forbidden.
[03:22:41.771 --> 03:22:44.972]  Poor old Tommy, he's in prison.
[03:22:44.972 --> 03:22:47.533]  While two jihadis, flats are given.
[03:22:47.533 --> 03:22:50.954]  And ISIS killers, all forgiven.
[03:22:50.954 --> 03:22:55.175]  Hitler's Nazis could not manage.
[03:22:55.175 --> 03:22:58.496]  What are quislings done in damage?
[03:22:58.496 --> 03:23:06.159]  If Churchill were around today, I'm confident that he would say, in older and more modern time,
[03:23:06.875 --> 03:23:22.963]  Treason must be capital crime, Patriots must be supported, And invaders all deported, Till our girls walk unmolested, After British medals tested.
[03:23:22.963 --> 03:23:28.866]  Will saving Blighty come too late, Before the Saxon learns to hate?
[03:23:28.866 --> 03:23:35.329]  If saving's coming, it can't wait, Or Islam will be Britain's fate.
[03:23:37.386 --> 03:23:41.548]  And if it happens, Brits can thank their traitor class.
[03:23:41.548 --> 03:23:47.830]  And I'd like to speak a little bit about this dynamic of a traitor class, because it's not unique to Britain.
[03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:50.531]  It might be especially worse in Britain.
[03:23:50.531 --> 03:23:57.233]  This, you know, this hereditary bloodline of people that think it's their right to rule forever.
[03:23:57.233 --> 03:24:00.034]  And I'm not only speaking of the Royals.
[03:24:00.034 --> 03:24:03.395]  But this is a dynamic that's happened continually.
[03:24:03.395 --> 03:24:04.976]  And I'd like to explain how it works.
[03:24:05.928 --> 03:24:11.691]  And to do that, I need to introduce a new concept today, or a new concept for most folks.
[03:24:11.691 --> 03:24:16.593]  And it's something called the bride price, also known as dowry.
[03:24:16.593 --> 03:24:26.978]  But in espionage tradecraft terms, the bride price is what a defector brings with him to prove that his defection is genuine.
[03:24:26.978 --> 03:24:35.062]  Whether it was in the old Soviet days with a Soviet spy coming our way, or one of ours like Kim Philby going from Britain to Moscow,
[03:24:35.856 --> 03:24:39.739]  You have to bring a gift with you to prove you're sincere.
[03:24:39.739 --> 03:24:47.385]  It would be a list of your fellow countrymen, spies, undercovers, scientific secrets.
[03:24:47.385 --> 03:24:51.648]  Something that lets the people you're defecting to know that it's legit.
[03:24:51.648 --> 03:24:52.328]  It's valid.
[03:24:52.328 --> 03:24:53.529]  You can never go back.
[03:24:53.529 --> 03:24:54.650]  You've burned your bridges.
[03:24:56.488 --> 03:25:06.990]  This also works on a macro level with trader classes that are preparing to be taken over by another power.
[03:25:06.990 --> 03:25:11.811]  This we saw continually with the spread of Islam.
[03:25:11.811 --> 03:25:22.513]  A trader class would pretend to be against the invaders, but not really resisting them hard while telling their people, don't worry, we've got it under control.
[03:25:23.766 --> 03:25:27.510]  All the while they're preparing to sell their own people out.
[03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:33.055]  And what they're doing, their bride price, is to serve as Judas goats.
[03:25:33.055 --> 03:25:39.200]  To be the face of safety and calm while more and more Muslims move in.
[03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:48.449]  The goal for the trader class is that they'll preserve their power, their prestige, their status, their position, even in an Islamic society.
[03:25:49.261 --> 03:25:59.007]  We saw this particularly, it's a great local microcosm example, in former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia.
[03:25:59.007 --> 03:26:13.875]  A reason for the great hatred there was that it wasn't that Ottoman Turks came in and settled and colonized, they took over, but it was all ethnic Serbs and Croats, but many of them converted to Islam hundreds of years ago.
[03:26:13.875 --> 03:26:17.517]  And the ones that converted were primarily the ones with power and wealth.
[03:26:18.138 --> 03:26:30.860]  Shopkeepers, landowners, noblemen, the people that went and fought from the hills that turned partisan, went and fought guerrilla war, lost all their money, they never converted.
[03:26:30.860 --> 03:26:44.283]  Well, they hated, and hate to this day, the heirs and the sons of the people that they thought sold out, you know, converted readily because they wanted to keep their power and their wealth as the country became Islamic.
[03:26:44.283 --> 03:26:46.743]  This is a process we're seeing today in England.
[03:26:47.495 --> 03:26:57.518]  When you see someone like Theresa May standing with radicals wearing a hijab, this is similar to somebody wearing a Nazi armband.
[03:26:57.518 --> 03:27:05.861]  I mean, imagine if you're a girl trapped somewhere in, you know, some Arab Muslim country not wanting to be a slave.
[03:27:05.861 --> 03:27:14.504]  And then you see the leader of one of the free countries wearing the slave uniform, the equivalent of the Nazi armband, the hijab.
[03:27:15.581 --> 03:27:17.322]  Imagine how discouraging that is.
[03:27:17.322 --> 03:27:22.963]  This signals to Muslims everywhere that Britain is submitting.
[03:27:22.963 --> 03:27:25.364]  Britain is already surrendering.
[03:27:25.364 --> 03:27:28.785]  So you can't just say, don't worry about it.
[03:27:28.785 --> 03:27:31.766]  Britain will always, there will always be a Britain.
[03:27:31.766 --> 03:27:34.006]  They thought there would always be a Christian Egypt.
[03:27:34.006 --> 03:27:37.627]  They thought there would always be a Christian Turkey.
[03:27:37.627 --> 03:27:39.848]  You go down the list, country after country.
[03:27:39.848 --> 03:27:43.509]  None of these Christian countries thought that they would become Islamic.
[03:27:44.355 --> 03:27:55.144]  Yet once the parents sell out and convert to protect their wealth, to save their lives, once this happens, their children are just raised in madrasa schools.
[03:27:55.144 --> 03:27:57.726]  They'll never know their parents sold them out.
[03:27:57.726 --> 03:28:04.251]  They'll just know that I'm a Muslim and centuries go by and another country is chalked up to Islam.
[03:28:04.251 --> 03:28:07.413]  This is where Britain finds itself today.
[03:28:07.413 --> 03:28:10.816]  It's very close and we need to, at this point,
[03:28:11.602 --> 03:28:15.324]  Really start finding ways to fight back or give it up.
[03:28:15.324 --> 03:28:23.910]  The way I fight back is calling people traitors, calling them quizlings, make them feel some pain for selling out their people.
[03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:25.370]  Don't let them get it for free.

[03:29:54.397 --> 03:30:01.319]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[03:30:01.319 --> 03:30:03.840]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:10.102]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge and the world is taking notice.

[03:30:54.210 --> 03:31:04.802]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:31:04.802 --> 03:31:06.885]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.

[03:31:11.230 --> 03:31:11.350]  It's
[03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.730]  I think?
[03:31:34.926 --> 03:31:46.635]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:46.635 --> 03:31:49.937]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[03:32:56.767 --> 03:33:15.622]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.622 --> 03:33:22.167]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.606 --> 03:33:35.069]  This next segment, we're going to cut to a video that's very fresh, really fun and interesting.
[03:33:35.069 --> 03:33:42.834]  This was a totally chance meeting of Alex and Bernie Sanders in a California airport.
[03:33:42.834 --> 03:33:49.877]  One of the things that I love about Alex and Owen and even President Trump is that they're fighters.
[03:33:49.877 --> 03:33:52.219]  They're just naturally fighters.
[03:33:52.219 --> 03:33:56.541]  And I would rather be back to back in a foxhole in a bar fight
[03:33:57.256 --> 03:34:09.347]  With a fighter, even if they sometimes throw wild punches, then with some very careful soy boy Mitt Romney type, any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
[03:34:09.347 --> 03:34:16.373]  Anyway, this is a really fun video because Bernie is now actually forced to fly with the people again.
[03:34:16.373 --> 03:34:23.499]  After the election, he was promised his own Gulfstar or Gulfstream jet for a while, but I guess that ran out.
[03:34:23.499 --> 03:34:23.979]  But this is
[03:34:25.666 --> 03:34:38.638]  Bernie showing his back, running away, while fat soy boys get in the face of Alex and the Infowars crew, who are always up for a rumble, a verbal rumble.
[03:34:38.638 --> 03:34:41.860]  And of course, the other side, they're not.
[03:34:41.860 --> 03:34:43.802]  They can't control the environment.
[03:34:43.802 --> 03:34:45.504]  They're not ready to fight.
[03:34:45.504 --> 03:34:51.329]  But Alex, Owen, Donald Trump, these guys will never shy away from a fight.
[03:34:51.329 --> 03:34:52.650]  And that's why I really love them.
[03:34:53.331 --> 03:34:56.532]  So this video, I'm not sure how old it is.
[03:34:56.532 --> 03:35:03.593]  It's just a couple of, really, I think it's just yesterday and just earlier today.
[03:35:03.593 --> 03:35:08.374]  So it's a really fun video because you can see how the two sides differ.
[03:35:08.374 --> 03:35:13.375]  One side won't come out and fight unless they've got black masks and bicycle locks.
[03:35:13.375 --> 03:35:19.396]  And our side, no matter what the turf is, we're ready for a verbal rumble.
[03:35:19.396 --> 03:35:22.337]  And Alex gives a good rumble in this one.
[03:35:23.044 --> 03:35:27.226]  So this and this is fun, too, because you can see the reaction of the crowd.
[03:35:27.226 --> 03:35:31.609]  Bernie, he's just a he's just a little dried up shell at this point in his life.
[03:35:33.662 --> 03:35:37.525]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[03:35:37.525 --> 03:35:40.447]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:35:40.447 --> 03:35:41.228]  No, Sanders.
[03:35:41.228 --> 03:35:42.088]  No, Sanders.
[03:35:42.088 --> 03:35:42.789]  No, Sanders.
[03:36:04.750 --> 03:36:13.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just got off our plane here at LAX and Bernie Sanders, the living embodiment of communist and socialist evil and failure, was here.
[03:36:13.143 --> 03:36:17.630]  A living museum piece of Mao Zedong or Joseph Stalin or V.I.
[03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:18.692]  Lenin.
[03:36:18.692 --> 03:36:19.694]  In fact, after
[03:36:20.134 --> 03:36:21.255]  Go on board the trip with the aircraft.
[03:36:21.255 --> 03:36:22.115]  We'll be in 40 in a month.
[03:36:49.489 --> 03:36:51.531]  Well, they didn't know Bernie Sanders.
[03:36:51.531 --> 03:36:52.892]  Dude, no.
[03:36:52.892 --> 03:36:54.214]  Come on, not right now.
[03:36:54.214 --> 03:36:55.715]  No, Senator.
[03:36:55.715 --> 03:36:59.558]  Why'd you say white people didn't know us like before?
[03:36:59.558 --> 03:37:04.563]  Let me guess, you guys aren't flying first class, are you?
[03:37:04.563 --> 03:37:07.446]  Why's he running?
[03:37:07.446 --> 03:37:11.369]  I don't know why.
[03:37:11.369 --> 03:37:12.951]  I guess flying first class you shouldn't be.
[03:37:13.971 --> 03:37:15.472]  I got a coach ticket in my pocket.
[03:37:15.472 --> 03:37:16.572]  We don't do that in Venezuela.
[03:37:16.572 --> 03:37:18.433]  I like his $100,000 alimony.
[03:37:18.433 --> 03:37:20.594]  I'm gonna walk this way.
[03:37:20.594 --> 03:37:21.054]  Don't touch me.
[03:37:21.054 --> 03:37:22.415]  You just hit me, bro.
[03:37:22.415 --> 03:37:23.255]  You put your hand out, Alex.
[03:37:23.255 --> 03:37:25.996]  Oh, you're gonna do that socialist thing where you like bump into people and see what they do?
[03:37:25.996 --> 03:37:27.857]  Alex, I'm walking back.
[03:37:27.857 --> 03:37:30.658]  Hey, Bernie.
[03:37:30.658 --> 03:37:31.598]  Bernie, why are you running, bro?
[03:37:31.598 --> 03:37:35.040]  There we go.
[03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:36.040]  Karl Rove didn't run like this.
[03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:36.921]  He was talking to me.
[03:37:36.921 --> 03:37:37.421]  I'll talk to you.
[03:37:38.424 --> 03:37:39.324]  Do you want to have a conversation?
[03:37:39.324 --> 03:37:41.426]  He said, why do people know what it's like to be poor?
[03:37:41.426 --> 03:37:43.146]  That's why people are poor.
[03:37:43.146 --> 03:37:44.767]  He said, why do people know what it's like to be poor?
[03:37:44.767 --> 03:37:47.469]  I thought it was a really racist thing to say.
[03:37:47.469 --> 03:37:52.431]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[03:37:52.431 --> 03:37:55.113]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:37:55.113 --> 03:38:01.256]  You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.
[03:38:01.256 --> 03:38:05.138]  You guys are so afraid of stuff.
[03:38:05.138 --> 03:38:06.759]  Wow, Bernie Sanders runs from Alex Jones.
[03:38:09.168 --> 03:38:11.349]  Don't worry.
[03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:12.949]  Get my beautiful face on camera.
[03:38:12.949 --> 03:38:13.489]  Don't worry.
[03:38:13.489 --> 03:38:16.250]  We'll destroy America.
[03:38:16.250 --> 03:38:20.631]  We'll turn it into Venezuela.
[03:38:20.631 --> 03:38:24.791]  Don't worry.
[03:38:24.791 --> 03:38:28.552]  Bernie, why'd you say white people don't know what's like before?
[03:38:28.552 --> 03:38:29.132]  Don't touch me.
[03:38:29.132 --> 03:38:30.653]  Alex, don't touch me.
[03:38:30.653 --> 03:38:31.873]  Don't touch me, Alex.
[03:38:31.873 --> 03:38:33.713]  You guys have fun.
[03:38:33.713 --> 03:38:35.294]  Gotta be around the general public, huh?
[03:38:35.294 --> 03:38:37.214]  It's kind of a bad thing.
[03:38:38.404 --> 03:38:39.245]  You're on the proletariat like that?
[03:38:39.245 --> 03:38:40.085]  You're a ruling class commie?
[03:38:40.085 --> 03:38:40.165]  Huh?
[03:38:40.165 --> 03:38:40.706]  You guys having fun?
[03:38:40.706 --> 03:38:41.306]  We're having fun.
[03:38:41.306 --> 03:38:42.487]  We're all having fun, aren't we?
[03:38:42.487 --> 03:38:42.827]  We're gonna win.
[03:38:42.827 --> 03:38:43.147]  Don't worry.
[03:38:43.147 --> 03:38:43.587]  Merrick's coming back.
[03:38:43.587 --> 03:38:44.148]  Merrick's coming back.
[03:38:44.148 --> 03:38:44.428]  We're winning.
[03:38:59.554 --> 03:39:01.155]  Have a good one.
[03:39:01.155 --> 03:39:05.277]  The truth is the left is the most vicious, evil ideology the planet's ever seen.
[03:39:05.277 --> 03:39:06.518]  It's a historical fact.
[03:39:06.518 --> 03:39:08.779]  They always lecture us how we're violent, we're bad.
[03:39:08.779 --> 03:39:10.400]  They're the ones that want to abort all the babies.
[03:39:10.400 --> 03:39:17.924]  They're the ones that wanted to block Trump being able to have all the experimental cures and treatments given to people that were terminal.
[03:39:17.924 --> 03:39:19.525]  They're the people that love the culture of death.
[03:39:19.525 --> 03:39:22.167]  Just like Bernie supported Black Lives Matter.
[03:39:22.167 --> 03:39:26.169]  Just like he wouldn't decry the cop killers when they killed cops.
[03:39:26.169 --> 03:39:27.250]  That's the type of monster
[03:39:28.260 --> 03:39:30.141]  A cold-blooded person that Sanders is.
[03:39:30.141 --> 03:39:32.983]  He wants to overthrow this country via conquest.
[03:39:32.983 --> 03:39:39.887]  Bernie Sanders is a monster.
[03:39:39.887 --> 03:39:43.430]  Mr. Sanders, why do you think socialism works better than capitalism?
[03:39:43.430 --> 03:39:46.351]  And why do you live in a capitalist country?
[03:39:46.351 --> 03:39:47.412]  I don't know why you're running from it.
[03:39:49.397 --> 03:39:50.338]  Where are you flying today?
[03:39:50.338 --> 03:39:52.779]  You gonna apologize to the Sandy Hook family, Alex?
[03:39:52.779 --> 03:39:54.481]  Well, that's the media misrepresents that.
[03:39:54.481 --> 03:39:57.903]  You apologize for all the wars you guys launched, the Democrats?
[03:39:57.903 --> 03:39:59.904]  All the millions you killed?
[03:39:59.904 --> 03:40:03.167]  Do you enjoy living in your million-dollar vacation houses, Bernie?
[03:40:03.167 --> 03:40:04.928]  Or do you want to give those to the world?
[03:40:04.928 --> 03:40:11.833]  Yeah, your $100,000 Audis?
[03:40:11.833 --> 03:40:13.714]  Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[03:40:13.714 --> 03:40:14.455]  You guys have fun.
[03:40:19.332 --> 03:40:20.554]  You guys are running a little PR stuff.
[03:40:20.554 --> 03:40:23.517]  It's not going to work.
[03:40:23.517 --> 03:40:28.483]  Have fun, you know.
[03:40:28.483 --> 03:40:30.425]  Good luck when Google gets broken up.
[03:40:30.425 --> 03:40:32.327]  Apologize to the Sandy Hook family, Alex.
[03:40:32.327 --> 03:40:32.788]  You guys need to.
[03:40:32.788 --> 03:40:33.829]  Right?
[03:40:33.829 --> 03:40:36.292]  You made those places victimless armament zones.
[03:40:36.292 --> 03:40:36.893]  And advertising.
[03:40:37.879 --> 03:40:41.300]  What do you think about the fact that 98% of mass shootings occur in gun-free zones?
[03:40:41.300 --> 03:40:43.841]  Bernie, do you want to get rid of those?
[03:40:43.841 --> 03:40:46.302]  Why'd you stop being an idiot for a second?
[03:40:46.302 --> 03:40:46.942]  It's okay.
[03:40:46.942 --> 03:40:48.043]  I know it's okay.
[03:40:48.043 --> 03:40:49.783]  Are you mad Hillary stole the election from him?
[03:40:49.783 --> 03:40:51.884]  I'm mad you're a Sandy Hook denier.
[03:40:51.884 --> 03:40:53.605]  You guys are religion.
[03:40:53.605 --> 03:40:55.305]  Who's my guy?
[03:40:55.305 --> 03:40:56.146]  What guy am I?
[03:40:56.146 --> 03:40:56.786]  You like Hillary.
[03:40:56.786 --> 03:40:57.506]  What guy am I?
[03:40:57.506 --> 03:40:58.666]  No, you like Hillary.
[03:40:58.666 --> 03:40:59.527]  Did I bring up Hillary?
[03:41:02.240 --> 03:41:06.942]  You deny Sandy Hook and you're giving him a hard time?
[03:41:06.942 --> 03:41:08.603]  Hillary edited tapes of that.
[03:41:08.603 --> 03:41:11.064]  Oh, Hillary edited tapes of Sandy Hook?
[03:41:11.064 --> 03:41:11.925]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:41:11.925 --> 03:41:13.105]  You're an idiot.
[03:41:13.105 --> 03:41:13.666]  You win.
[03:41:13.666 --> 03:41:16.427]  Why don't you talk about all the wars and stuff that's killed millions of people?
[03:41:16.427 --> 03:41:20.629]  Or Hillary launching a whole thing in Libya and destabilizing the whole country instead of feeling good about yourself?
[03:41:22.336 --> 03:41:23.877]  You're a virtue signaler.
[03:41:23.877 --> 03:41:26.559]  Yeah, so... What about the troops that died there?
[03:41:26.559 --> 03:41:29.260]  Do you know how Benghazi, Hillary were to stand out?
[03:41:29.260 --> 03:41:31.422]  It looks like millions to come.
[03:41:31.422 --> 03:41:36.985]  You guys are losing worlds of weight to socialism and all the so-called elite intelligentsia that run it.
[03:41:36.985 --> 03:41:38.025]  They're totally awake to it.
[03:41:38.025 --> 03:41:38.506]  Oh, yeah.
[03:41:38.506 --> 03:41:39.766]  They get what's going on in there, really.
[03:41:39.766 --> 03:41:42.028]  Just showing that that's who you are.
[03:41:44.129 --> 03:41:46.271]  Anyways, I gotta go catch my flight.
[03:41:46.271 --> 03:41:47.873]  You guys have a great day.
[03:41:47.873 --> 03:41:48.193]  Please.
[03:41:48.193 --> 03:41:49.274]  One less idiot in L.A.
[03:41:49.274 --> 03:41:50.475]  is good.
[03:41:50.475 --> 03:41:51.076]  Yup.
[03:41:51.076 --> 03:41:52.157]  Well, L.A.'
[03:41:52.137 --> 03:41:53.598]  's gotta hit their idiot max.
[03:41:53.598 --> 03:41:57.021]  I'm not sure of one of them.
[03:41:57.021 --> 03:42:03.126]  Hey, Bernie, why'd you say white people don't know what it's like to be poor?
[03:42:03.126 --> 03:42:04.768]  Why are you so racist?
[03:42:04.768 --> 03:42:07.030]  Won't answer that, but he did say it.
[03:42:08.826 --> 03:42:10.267]  Move to Venezuela, Bernie.
[03:42:10.267 --> 03:42:10.987]  You'll like it.
[03:42:10.987 --> 03:42:13.628]  People like you there.
[03:42:13.628 --> 03:42:21.090]  So over and over again, they want to change the subject from communism and socialism destroying hundreds of countries and killing over 200 million people.
[03:42:21.090 --> 03:42:28.213]  They want to change the subject to myself and others asking questions about big public events that are used to blame the Second Amendment.
[03:42:28.213 --> 03:42:29.033]  This is incredible.
[03:42:29.033 --> 03:42:32.614]  But as long as they can't guilt you into their mind control, they fail.
[03:42:32.614 --> 03:42:34.375]  They are sociopaths and psychopaths.
[03:42:35.035 --> 03:42:39.600]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:40.320]  You don't know
[03:42:53.393 --> 03:42:57.338]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:42:57.338 --> 03:43:00.622]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:43:00.622 --> 03:43:06.909]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:43:06.909 --> 03:43:09.672]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:43:10.393 --> 03:43:14.219]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:43:14.219 --> 03:43:20.708]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:43:20.708 --> 03:43:25.674]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:30.323]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:43:30.323 --> 03:43:37.528]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:43:37.528 --> 03:43:42.231]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:43:42.231 --> 03:43:48.435]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:43:48.435 --> 03:43:52.418]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:43:53.473 --> 03:44:02.958]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[03:44:02.958 --> 03:44:07.641]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[03:45:53.980 --> 03:46:01.609]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[03:46:01.609 --> 03:46:09.539]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[03:46:09.539 --> 03:46:12.622]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:46:13.243 --> 03:46:17.886]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:46:17.886 --> 03:46:22.029]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[03:46:22.029 --> 03:46:25.172]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[03:46:25.172 --> 03:46:29.355]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:46:29.935 --> 03:46:33.397]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:46:33.397 --> 03:46:48.488]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[03:46:48.488 --> 03:46:50.009]  That is critical to this fight.
[03:46:50.009 --> 03:46:52.210]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[03:46:57.771 --> 03:47:01.653]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:01.653 --> 03:47:17.962]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:17.962 --> 03:47:24.126]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.634 --> 03:47:35.078]  Okay, that's a lot of fun watching that last segment with Alex in the airport.
[03:47:35.078 --> 03:47:40.201]  And you know, it goes to show what an in-house operation this really is.
[03:47:40.201 --> 03:47:43.563]  And I mean, there's no billionaire backers behind this.
[03:47:43.563 --> 03:47:46.125]  It's all our team.
[03:47:46.125 --> 03:47:51.909]  And to do this, to make this, to pull it all off, we have to even pitch our own stuff.
[03:47:51.909 --> 03:47:52.850]  That's how it works.
[03:47:52.850 --> 03:47:55.031]  That's what keeps the power running.
[03:47:55.031 --> 03:47:59.334]  So right now, Brain Force Plus and Super Male Vitality
[03:48:00.097 --> 03:48:02.558]  Are 50% off with free shipping.
[03:48:02.558 --> 03:48:05.038]  That's 50% off with free shipping.
[03:48:05.038 --> 03:48:07.699]  You can't beat it, especially if you're trying it for the first time.
[03:48:07.699 --> 03:48:10.780]  This is how you support the program, folks.
[03:48:10.780 --> 03:48:12.080]  There's no other way to do it.
[03:48:12.080 --> 03:48:14.140]  This isn't Ben Shapiro.
[03:48:14.140 --> 03:48:15.961]  This isn't the network news.
[03:48:15.961 --> 03:48:18.662]  There's nobody behind us, just us.
[03:48:18.662 --> 03:48:21.422]  So it's us together, and that's how we run it.
[03:48:21.422 --> 03:48:23.463]  So please support InfoWars.
[03:48:23.463 --> 03:48:28.224]  Go to the InfoWars stores, get a t-shirt, get a hat, show the colors in public.
[03:48:29.113 --> 03:48:33.235]  And that's something that takes me back to the airport video.
[03:48:33.235 --> 03:48:41.838]  You know, in Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, they teach their side to make us abide by our rules.
[03:48:41.838 --> 03:48:52.762]  Because they know, for example, that we are polite people, we are going to abide by all the rules of decorum, and be very polite in public.
[03:48:52.762 --> 03:48:58.184]  These are the same communists that if they had power, would have us on trains to gulags tomorrow.
[03:48:58.968 --> 03:49:01.633]  So I say take the gloves off.
[03:49:01.633 --> 03:49:09.846]  I'm proud to be a fighter alongside Alex, alongside Owen, because we don't abide by the Alinsky rules.
[03:49:09.846 --> 03:49:10.908]  We've read the book.
[03:49:10.908 --> 03:49:12.351]  We understand the tactics.
[03:49:12.938 --> 03:49:15.419]  Don't give them the free public space.
[03:49:15.419 --> 03:49:16.640]  These are communists.
[03:49:16.640 --> 03:49:18.661]  They stand with communists.
[03:49:18.661 --> 03:49:26.304]  They're proud of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Mao Zedong, Stalin, people who killed hundreds of millions.
[03:49:26.304 --> 03:49:28.305]  They would kill us tomorrow.
[03:49:28.305 --> 03:49:30.426]  So in public, call them out.
[03:49:30.426 --> 03:49:31.967]  Call them communists.
[03:49:31.967 --> 03:49:33.527]  Call them traitors.
[03:49:33.527 --> 03:49:37.969]  Make them feel the pain, the burn, all the time.
[03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:39.490]  Don't give them a free pass.
[03:49:40.174 --> 03:49:45.837]  That's why I like wearing the t-shirt and mixing it up in public.
[03:49:45.837 --> 03:49:46.918]  They want us to hide.
[03:49:46.918 --> 03:49:48.638]  They want us to be shy.
[03:49:48.638 --> 03:49:49.439]  Don't let them.
[03:49:49.439 --> 03:49:54.902]  And don't let them have the free space to just walk like any ordinary average guy.
[03:49:54.902 --> 03:49:58.364]  Socialists stand for mass murder.
[03:49:58.364 --> 03:50:00.104]  They put on the tie.
[03:50:00.104 --> 03:50:01.145]  They put on the jacket.
[03:50:01.145 --> 03:50:02.906]  They act like a harmless old man.
[03:50:03.989 --> 03:50:15.056]  Harmless old men like Bernie were responsible for hundreds of millions of dead in the 20th century, still going on today in places like North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela.
[03:50:15.056 --> 03:50:18.778]  Anyway, I'm glad to be on today.
[03:50:18.778 --> 03:50:31.245]  Because today's first segment revolved around the UK, Tommy Robinson's arrest and so forth, I put my UK-oriented novel, it's called The Red Cliffs of Zerhoun,
[03:50:32.173 --> 03:50:34.195]  It's free today on Kindle.
[03:50:34.195 --> 03:50:39.939]  This is my outreach to the, uh, behind the PC curtain in Britannistan.
[03:50:39.939 --> 03:50:43.442]  You can't, you can't download YouTube videos there.
[03:50:43.442 --> 03:50:48.126]  It's getting tougher to share anything, but you can still go to Amazon.
[03:50:48.126 --> 03:50:55.772]  And when you're picking up my free book today, The Red Cliffs of Zerhoun, you can also click over to Tommy, to Tommy Robinson.
[03:50:55.772 --> 03:50:59.735]  He has two books, Enemy of the State, which is absolutely riveting.
[03:51:00.623 --> 03:51:04.325]  And why Muslims kill for Muhammad.
[03:51:04.325 --> 03:51:06.566]  These are great ways to support.
[03:51:06.566 --> 03:51:23.295]  It's like crowdfunding or a GoFundMe page just by going to Amazon, buying his books in print or on Kindle, and you'll be paying for the lawyers that this guy needs, you know, unless he's going to spend the next 13 months in the hole trying to survive amidst
[03:51:23.815 --> 03:51:36.745]  You know, these 7th century savages that will tear him to pieces with the blessing of the British trader elite who would love nothing more than to see Tommy Robinson dead in prison.
[03:51:36.745 --> 03:51:44.451]  So, support him by buying his books and while you're at Amazon, my book today that's free is The Red Cliffs of Zerhoun.
[03:51:44.451 --> 03:51:47.994]  It's just really an honor and a privilege to be here.
[03:51:47.994 --> 03:51:50.096]  I'm very glad to be on a team of fighters.
[03:51:50.859 --> 03:51:56.961]  And that's what we need to do, is stand on the skyline, be the brave ones.
[03:51:56.961 --> 03:51:58.601]  Nobody else will do it.
[03:51:58.601 --> 03:52:01.622]  If you're looking for John Wayne, he's not coming.
[03:52:01.622 --> 03:52:04.023]  You've got to be John Wayne.
[03:52:04.023 --> 03:52:06.224]  It's nobody else who's going to do it.
[03:52:06.224 --> 03:52:07.684]  Just us.
[03:52:07.684 --> 03:52:11.245]  So, anyway, I don't know if we have enough time to take callers.
[03:52:11.245 --> 03:52:13.286]  I'm sure that they're stacked up.
[03:52:13.286 --> 03:52:15.647]  If you... Oh, there's no time?
[03:52:15.647 --> 03:52:15.907]  Okay.
[03:52:16.604 --> 03:52:27.208]  Well, anyway, while you're thinking about how Europe and Britain, they're getting what they deserve, please don't look at it that way.
[03:52:27.208 --> 03:52:29.649]  They're our canary in our coal mine.
[03:52:29.649 --> 03:52:42.715]  If we don't get out now and make trouble and resist the socialists and Islamists who would take over our country and steal our freedom, if we don't do it, nobody's going to do it.
[03:52:42.715 --> 03:52:44.156]  It's just us.
[03:52:44.156 --> 03:52:45.076]  There's nobody else.
[03:52:45.942 --> 03:52:48.163]  We have to be the ones to fight.
[03:52:48.163 --> 03:52:57.027]  And that means don't be polite when you see people that are traitors, that are anti-patriotic.
[03:52:57.027 --> 03:53:02.329]  They might be flying under the radar today, but we know them for who they are.
[03:53:02.329 --> 03:53:09.353]  This involves not only the Islamists and the Socialists, but even within our own government.
[03:53:09.353 --> 03:53:12.514]  These deep state coup plotters, they're the same team.
[03:53:12.514 --> 03:53:13.254]  They're the globalists.
[03:53:15.259 --> 03:53:22.184]  They don't consider the United States of America to be the beacon for their country, for the world.
[03:53:22.184 --> 03:53:26.788]  They consider the United States of America to be the obstacle to globalism.
[03:53:26.788 --> 03:53:29.109]  Their goal is to take it down.
[03:53:29.109 --> 03:53:44.721]  And our goal is to preserve our constitutional republic and to fight for national identity anywhere in the world against the George Soros's and the globalists who would see us ground under those tanks on Tiananmen Square if they
[03:53:45.402 --> 03:53:47.683]  If they could, they would.
[03:53:47.683 --> 03:53:54.306]  That's why I'm glad that some people will say, Alex, why are you harassing that poor old Bernie Sanders?
[03:53:54.306 --> 03:53:59.608]  He's just trying to schlep his way down the concourse to an airplane.
[03:53:59.608 --> 03:54:05.670]  Alex does that because we need to let the communists know the gloves are off.
[03:54:05.670 --> 03:54:07.931]  We see them for what they are.
[03:54:07.931 --> 03:54:14.314]  They're not going to hide behind any cloaking device of civility.
[03:54:15.111 --> 03:54:30.798]  Unless they were to come out tomorrow and renounce communism, renounce socialism, apologize for the hundreds of millions murdered in the name of communism, I say call them out at every opportunity, every chance we get.
[03:54:30.798 --> 03:54:34.179]  And maybe I sound like a broken record.
[03:54:34.179 --> 03:54:35.180]  I probably do.
[03:54:35.180 --> 03:54:36.981]  I'm still pretty new at this.
[03:54:36.981 --> 03:54:41.042]  But I'm just proud to be associated with fighters finally.
[03:54:41.042 --> 03:54:41.863]  I'm very sick of
[03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:52.593]  Of the lukewarm conservatives that will support you in private messages and never support you in public.
[03:54:52.593 --> 03:54:55.674]  Or will give you praise in private.
[03:54:55.674 --> 03:55:03.736]  But they're always looking around to see who's looking when it comes to supporting somebody like Alex or Matt Bracken.
[03:55:03.736 --> 03:55:11.219]  So finally I'm on a team with people that aren't afraid and it feels really good.
[03:55:11.219 --> 03:55:12.459]  For me it feels really good.
[03:55:13.476 --> 03:55:19.601]  And for all of you Brits, I wish that you could freely share my tweet.
[03:55:19.601 --> 03:55:24.225]  I know that you would probably get a visit from the Thought Police if you did.
[03:55:24.225 --> 03:55:37.075]  But, you know, I take it as encouraging when I do get the direct messages, even though things are looking pretty grim behind the veil in PC Britannistan.
[03:55:37.938 --> 03:55:52.289]  Yeah, it's been a few decades since the commies rolled over the people in China, in Tiananmen Square, and right now Britain is on the knife edge of all other awful totalitarian events.
[03:55:52.289 --> 03:56:03.778]  And it's time now for the Brits to stand up the way that they have been, and in greater and greater numbers, never backing down, never surrendering, no surrender, no defeat.
[03:56:03.778 --> 03:56:05.460]  And if only 5% are Muslims today,
[03:56:08.106 --> 03:56:10.928]  And they're causing this much hell in that country.
[03:56:10.928 --> 03:56:13.409]  Imagine when it's 10 or 20 percent.
[03:56:13.409 --> 03:56:15.611]  So right now is the time to fight.
[03:56:15.611 --> 03:56:20.874]  Don't wait until we're Britain before you stand up and fight in this country.
[03:56:20.874 --> 03:56:22.755]  This is an all-out battle.
[03:56:22.755 --> 03:56:24.657]  It's a battle to the end.
[03:56:24.657 --> 03:56:30.940]  And we're going to either stand up together or we're going to go down together.
[03:56:30.940 --> 03:56:34.823]  And it's not going to happen on my watch if I can help it.
[03:56:35.549 --> 03:56:47.471]  You know, I've lived a good life, I've had a lot of fun, raised a family, and now it's my turn to stand up and, you know, take the slings and arrows, if that's what it takes, to maybe serve as an example.
[03:56:47.471 --> 03:56:51.972]  I certainly get courage from people like Alex, even from our president.
[03:56:51.972 --> 03:56:53.832]  They're not afraid.
[03:56:53.832 --> 03:56:57.353]  They put everything on the line, and so should you.
[03:56:57.353 --> 03:57:01.354]  Don't be afraid, at least, to share on social media.
[03:57:01.354 --> 03:57:03.034]  Goodness, if you won't do that,
[03:57:04.257 --> 03:57:06.798]  Are you going to fight when it really counts?
[03:57:06.798 --> 03:57:09.479]  So, it's been a great show today.
[03:57:09.479 --> 03:57:20.844]  It's been a pleasure to be on After Owen, and I'm happy to do it, and we'll see you again on the other side in two weeks.
[03:57:20.844 --> 03:57:23.886]  God willing, and the creek don't rise, I'll be here again.
[03:57:23.886 --> 03:57:29.168]  So thanks a lot for the opportunity, and that's all for today.

[03:58:50.312 --> 03:58:51.173]  It'd take hours.
