[00:00:01.687 --> 00:00:02.028]  I'm good.
[00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:47.954]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:49.476]  Our weapon is the truth and we use it.
[00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.672]  We fire at will, because we are over the target.
[00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:55.613]  And the sleeping giant has awakened.
[00:00:55.613 --> 00:00:59.156]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:01.778]  It is Sunday, the 24th, the day of June 2018.
[00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:06.923]  We'll be here for two hours, as we'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:07.623]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:15.009]  David Knight in the morning, doing a great job with The Real News, and of course, Owen Schroer.
[00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.371]  Epic times.
[00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.432]  Grave times.
[00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:19.333]  Fortuitous times.
[00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.573]  Interesting times.
[00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:27.356]  Dangerous times.
[00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:32.761]  Quick-moving, fast-changing, earth-changing times.
[00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:37.225]  25th Amendment times.
[00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:42.931]  You know, we've seen this before.
[00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:43.912]  We've seen this before.
[00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.265]  I was told that Trump would never win office.
[00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:49.506]  And I told you that was a lie.
[00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:52.188]  I told you it was fake polls.
[00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:55.110]  And then I was told over and over again he'd be removed.
[00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.530]  He'd never be seated as president.
[00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.291]  They would take the delegates.
[00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:11.119]  And then as soon as that failed, even though they'd been all over the news promoting it, they said, oh actually, we never said we were going to keep Trump from having his delegates seated.
[00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.382]  And then Nancy Pelosi's daughter went on TV and called for my arrest.
[00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:21.133]  On Fox News and made up lies about me that I threatened her.
[00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.214]  How do you threaten a dead dog?
[00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:26.115]  A rotting, soulless corpse?
[00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:30.477]  You don't.
[00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:33.978]  But she was pissed because I was killing her plan to overthrow the President.
[00:02:33.978 --> 00:02:38.941]  Before he ever got into office.
[00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:44.343]  And so now... We have the usual suspects.
[00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:46.244]  Two different former CIA directors.
[00:02:48.683 --> 00:03:01.287]  Coming out over the weekend and saying, we're going to call for the 25th Amendment to be implemented to unseat the president for dereliction of duty and incompetence and mental illness.
[00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:10.090]  The mentally ill person that never ran for office and beat you and turned the economy around and did all this and got peace deals, right?
[00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.731]  There's the article from The Hill.
[00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:17.533]  Ex-CIA chief calls on White House cabinet to revolt against Trump and remove him from office.
[00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:23.183]  Insurrection by GOP leadership, inner circle necessary to stop President, he says.
[00:03:23.183 --> 00:03:24.224]  And who is he?
[00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:30.007]  He's the Wahhabist Brennanite, who in college admitted he was part of the Communist Party.
[00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:33.269]  The CIA said, well, my God, let's put you at the top.
[00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:42.834]  He's got Clapper behind him, calling for the same garbage, and other former CIA directors as well.
[00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:45.656]  And they want the 25th Amendment implemented to remove him
[00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:52.177]  They want it done as soon as possible.
[00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:53.497]  But here's the thing.
[00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:55.357]  They've been pushing this.
[00:03:55.357 --> 00:03:56.318]  Remember the clips we played?
[00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:57.158]  I'm not going to play them again today.
[00:03:57.158 --> 00:04:00.278]  We played them so many times.
[00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:07.980]  Where Phil Mudd and Brennan and Clapper would go on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and say, oh, he'll be out by December.
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.621]  We're about to remove him extrajudicially.
[00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:17.202]  And our good little buddy Wolf Blitzer would say,
[00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.451]  Oh, you mean impeachment?
[00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.552]  They said no, no, no.
[00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.294]  Extrajudicially.
[00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:27.597]  But see, that never happened.
[00:04:27.597 --> 00:04:32.962]  So, why is this done?
[00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:39.707]  This is done so all the crooks that are embedded in the government, stay behind networks is the CIA term.
[00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:43.750]  They hold on, like the infantry's coming, or the cavalry.
[00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.672]  It's not coming.
[00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:47.634]  I've looked at all possible permutations.
[00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:51.827]  That have human interaction involved.
[00:04:51.827 --> 00:04:59.373]  If you kill Trump or remove him, it's even worse for you.
[00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:03.337]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:06.640]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.102]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater.
[00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:12.905]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:15.667]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:20.209]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:26.671]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:31.653]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.331]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:43.515]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:48.217]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:54.441]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:58.403]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.940]  Big Brother.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.740]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.641]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:07.302]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:08.983]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:14.245]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:15.926]  You know, here's the paradox.
[00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:55.024]  You've got mainstream corporate media openly allied with Communist China, the EU, and a bunch of big mega-banks who write articles in the Financial Times of London, in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, and just everywhere about how America's done, Americans are dumb, lazy scumbags, white people are bad, but it's like old white people saying this, and China's going to take over, and China's going to bust America's chops,
[00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:01.813]  The head, unelected head of the EU, Juncker, will defeat us.
[00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:06.641]  I mean, he said a year and a half ago, I'll crush Trump, we'll have trade war, we'll shut the U.S.
[00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:06.841]  down.
[00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:16.569]  Like, these are fighting words, and I'm reading it in the Financial Times of London, New Yorker Magazine, New York Times, Atlantic Monthly.
[00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.229]  These are establishment publications.
[00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.410]  They're like, we're ending the family.
[00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.731]  We're going to savage the US.
[00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.072]  China has 97% of the rare earth minerals.
[00:07:25.072 --> 00:07:27.032]  The US will never come back.
[00:07:27.032 --> 00:07:30.793]  Lloyd Blankfein, before he got kicked out of Goldman Sachs, is like, I was just at China.
[00:07:30.793 --> 00:07:32.814]  They've got 10 times the infrastructure of Trump.
[00:07:32.814 --> 00:07:34.595]  You'll never bring America back.
[00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:35.875]  These are in tweets.
[00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.636]  They're like, God, these people like breathlessly.
[00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:40.257]  We'll get you people.
[00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:43.519]  And it's like, what did we do to you?
[00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:45.300]  But America's the big enchilada.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.001]  It had half the wealth in 1955.
[00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:50.743]  So they parlayed it into global corporate power.
[00:07:50.743 --> 00:07:55.705]  So if you're going to screw America over, why not get in a culture of hating it?
[00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:57.506]  They're not like, well, we're bleeding the country dry.
[00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:01.548]  It was a great, beautiful lady, but we're sacrificing her for our global power.
[00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:04.830]  No, they're too big of cowards to admit they're doing it.
[00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.171]  So they decide to hate it.
[00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:10.036]  And that's what I want you to understand.
[00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:13.238]  Trump doesn't hate America.
[00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:25.446]  And so, he's like, you see these speeches, and these are real numbers, you've seen them, they don't even debate these, he's like, Canada has a 270% Gary tax, and we have zero?
[00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:28.468]  Trump goes, okay, I'll put 100% on them.
[00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:31.590]  And they go, oh my God, you backward hateful person!
[00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.290]  He's like, wait, you got a 270!
[00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:36.049]  270!
[00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:48.574]  I mean, if anything, Trump's being too soft, but he knows he could destabilize things, so he's just like, hey China, you got a $900 billion trade deficit, we'll do $50 billion, just pay it, and promise to start taking some of our cards, and I'll leave you alone.
[00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:52.495]  And China goes, trade war.
[00:08:52.495 --> 00:08:59.038]  Trump goes, okay, $200 billion.
[00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:02.379]  I mean, this is all something that morons should be able to understand.
[00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:09.235]  But instead, the clip's coming up, we've got Bill Maher went on Friday night again after two weeks ago.
[00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:12.658]  It only works every two weeks, it's a lazy ass.
[00:09:12.658 --> 00:09:17.123]  And he goes, I, you all need to go to college about perspective.
[00:09:18.772 --> 00:09:24.295]  Trump's way worse than a recession, and so I want a recession to make him look bad.
[00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:28.017]  Oh, not, he got us out of a recession.
[00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:29.158]  Not, oh, he's doing a great job.
[00:09:29.158 --> 00:09:31.899]  They admit he's getting us out of the recession depression.
[00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:39.223]  But see, Mar lied there, because if you actually look at what Mar said, he said, I want to crash the economy.
[00:09:39.223 --> 00:09:42.205]  Crashing the economy means people starving in the streets like Venezuela.
[00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:48.048]  It doesn't, or 1929, it doesn't mean, so the PR people had a problem.
[00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:55.197]  He came out two weeks ago and said, I want to crash, that's the quote, crash the U.S.
[00:09:55.197 --> 00:09:56.117]  economy.
[00:09:56.117 --> 00:10:02.061]  And I noticed after I shot a video that day, I saw it right away.
[00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:05.483]  Saw the news about it and I went and did a video.
[00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:07.364]  He's hoping for a crashing economy.
[00:10:07.364 --> 00:10:09.586]  That's a close quote.
[00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:11.387]  So they spun it that he just meant a recession.
[00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:25.888]  Now, think about that.
[00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:27.028]  They're telling you everything.
[00:10:27.028 --> 00:10:29.289]  They're showing you their hand right there.
[00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:36.330]  Globalism, if you read Atlantic Monthly, or you read what Obama said when he went to Africa or South America, it's the same crap.
[00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330]  He goes to Africa and says you gotta be poor.
[00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:44.031]  He goes everywhere and says you gotta be poor.
[00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:47.392]  Because the globalists want you under their control.
[00:10:47.392 --> 00:10:48.872]  It's called feudalism.
[00:10:50.151 --> 00:11:06.884]  And so how big a deal is it that we elected Trump, and a year and a half later the whole Russiagate thing's proven to be a fraud, and then now they're just continuing on with the narrative that, oh, he was mean to these kids, and it turns out the little girl was never separated from her mother.
[00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:09.426]  83% of the kids don't even have parents when they come in.
[00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:10.467]  A lot of them have been killed.
[00:11:10.467 --> 00:11:14.530]  There's no discussion of that or that he's continuing the Obama policy and trying to even change the law.
[00:11:16.144 --> 00:11:24.450]  None of that matters to people that just want to have an emotional response, and feel big, and feel powerful, and feel like they've been wronged.
[00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:33.236]  When Trump's already offered Mexico deals to stabilize their economy, their government, dollarize their deal, and bring them way up, that would be good for U.S.
[00:11:33.236 --> 00:11:34.237]  national security.
[00:11:34.237 --> 00:11:36.278]  And Mexico's a great country.
[00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:37.079]  And I don't just say that.
[00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:43.503]  Mexico's beautiful, great, interesting culture, but it's got corruption, and if you don't get rid of that, it'll bring you down.
[00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:44.464]  Look at every other nation.
[00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:49.096]  Look at our own problem with corruption right now.
[00:11:49.096 --> 00:11:58.501]  And what will it be like when the economy comes back in a year and a half, just because Trump's in there, and he's only gotten a little bit of control over things, maybe 20, 30 percent, to just change a little bit of what they were doing?
[00:11:58.501 --> 00:12:01.322]  Can you imagine what he could do if he stays in?
[00:12:01.322 --> 00:12:12.007]  And that's why they're panicking, because they know that if Trump is able to continue to turn things around, you will a thousand percent understand the con game, and it's all over, and you won't want to be dependent.
[00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:14.948]  You won't want to be a slave.
[00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:15.749]  So you think about
[00:12:17.378 --> 00:12:25.580]  Somebody worth $100 million, in his own words, who makes $10 million a year just on his HBO show, Bill Maher.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.961]  And he lectures you again and says, you need to go take a course on comparison.
[00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:35.122]  Because it'd be better to have a crashing economy.
[00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:38.762]  He now provides it, backs it off to recession, than to have Trump in.
[00:12:38.762 --> 00:12:39.763]  Really?
[00:12:39.763 --> 00:12:40.163]  Really?
[00:12:40.163 --> 00:12:41.763]  What did Trump do?
[00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:43.203]  Go, oh, you got a $900 billion tariff on us.
[00:12:43.203 --> 00:12:43.703]  We'll do $50 billion.
[00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:51.106]  If anything, that isn't strong enough.
[00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:53.368]  But again, it shows how smart Trump is.
[00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:56.071]  He gets how dependent we are and how set up we are.
[00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:57.572]  He just says, give us something.
[00:12:57.572 --> 00:13:00.554]  My God.
[00:13:00.554 --> 00:13:02.196]  He's like, why do you hate America so much?
[00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:02.856]  Why?
[00:13:02.856 --> 00:13:04.057]  Why would we want to make it poor?
[00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:05.058]  That'll hurt the whole world to come.
[00:13:05.058 --> 00:13:05.899]  He's just a pragmatist.
[00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:12.404]  He's like, this is good real estate.
[00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:13.185]  That's what he says.
[00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:13.886]  It's what he did.
[00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:18.082]  And they're like, you're mentally ill because you don't hate America.
[00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:21.183]  You don't want the bigger... Trump doesn't get the big picture, folks.
[00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:22.163]  He's not smart.
[00:13:22.163 --> 00:13:25.044]  It's like child molesters that kidnap some kid and go rape him.
[00:13:25.044 --> 00:13:27.665]  And if a normal person said, man, that's sick, they'd go, oh, you just don't get it.
[00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:28.205]  You're crazy.
[00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:35.027]  Like if you were telling Hitler in 1942, when he's rounding up people for death camps, like, hey, dude, that's not really cool, but shut up.
[00:13:35.027 --> 00:13:35.688]  What do you know?
[00:13:35.688 --> 00:13:40.189]  I've got everything figured out.
[00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:41.129]  And it's the same.
[00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:42.210]  And then you look at Brennan.
[00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:49.632]  And all these other former CIA directors saying, we're going for the 25th amendment to have Trump's own cabinet.
[00:13:51.312 --> 00:13:54.414]  People say he's mentally incompatible and remove him.
[00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:56.235]  It'd be one thing if we were in a depression.
[00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.855]  It'd be one thing if we were in a war.
[00:13:57.855 --> 00:14:01.237]  It'd be one thing if he wasn't doing all these great things and showed all this stamina.
[00:14:01.237 --> 00:14:13.444]  But it's like some quarterback throws for four Super Bowls consecutively and wins, and is in their fifth Super Bowl, and is 50 points ahead of zero, and you go, my God, let's pull him and put him on the bench.
[00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:17.526]  You'd be like, what in the hell are you talking about?
[00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:24.428]  What planet are you from?
[00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:27.990]  Now, Trump's not a whiz kid.
[00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.991]  I'm gonna come back and play the Markleps, the new ones.
[00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:33.892]  Trump's not a whiz kid in that he could turn the economy around.
[00:14:33.892 --> 00:14:39.074]  You can't tie a modern industrial country like America down with our desire, our smarts.
[00:14:39.074 --> 00:14:40.955]  We had half the wealth 50 years ago.
[00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:41.676]  We only have 30, 20, 30 percent now.
[00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:48.226]  Just getting the foot off our neck was the move.
[00:14:48.226 --> 00:14:50.389]  It's like a leg's bleeding out, put a tourniquet around it.
[00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.172]  Well, Trump put a tourniquet on.
[00:14:52.172 --> 00:14:54.515]  Now it's barely bleeding instead of spraying blood all over the walls.
[00:14:57.782 --> 00:15:00.303]  That wasn't Trump's achievement.
[00:15:00.303 --> 00:15:20.851]  His vision to see it, his vision not to care about being attacked and losing over a billion dollars in boycotts and over a thousand lawsuits, and his will to not be a Satanist and a scumbag and a person that only cared about himself, but a bigger vision and to not want to screw everybody over and to want global victory and to want real peace, that was what Trump did.
[00:15:20.851 --> 00:15:22.112]  That's why he's amazing.
[00:15:24.266 --> 00:15:27.309]  He's only got 20-30% control right now.
[00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:32.355]  And we're turning over like somebody that had the flu and they got some chicken noodle soup and some Gatorade and they feel better.
[00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:35.198]  I mean, it's like, wow!
[00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:38.342]  And that's why they're panicking and that's why they want to remove him from office.
[00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:41.105]  So we'll get into what they're saying, what they're doing, play the clips, all of it.
[00:15:41.585 --> 00:15:45.010]  Straight ahead, if you're watching live on the TV or radio, please spread the word.
[00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.033]  Everybody you know, that's how we get around the censors.
[00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:56.145]  If you're watching live video links on NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com or Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, it's a total act of resistance to share that link and say, here's the forbidden information.
[00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:04.032]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:04.912]  It'd take hours.
[00:16:04.912 --> 00:16:07.353]  MycoZX Plus, it now has a lower price.
[00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:08.534]  It's stronger.
[00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:10.134]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:16:10.134 --> 00:16:13.356]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:16:13.356 --> 00:16:14.476]  It's back in stock.
[00:16:14.476 --> 00:16:17.657]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:16:17.657 --> 00:16:21.439]  It's got the preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.

[00:20:19.236 --> 00:20:23.698]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[00:20:23.698 --> 00:20:29.901]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:37.765]  Broadcasting worldwide and delivering human victory.
[00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:40.166]  That means planetary victory.
[00:20:42.022 --> 00:20:47.844]  The president let that slip, didn't he?
[00:20:47.844 --> 00:20:57.126]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in the midst of the battle for the victory and the future of humanity.
[00:20:57.126 --> 00:20:59.787]  I can't sleep.
[00:20:59.787 --> 00:21:03.628]  I can't do anything since you set your eyes on me.
[00:21:03.628 --> 00:21:07.089]  I tell you it's true.
[00:21:15.469 --> 00:21:18.710]  You're driving me crazy.
[00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.352]  Alright, let's get into the big news here.
[00:21:22.352 --> 00:21:35.238]  The globalists have been artificially suppressing Western nations, but they've also been on record suppressing developing nations to keep them in control and to exploit them, and then to weaponize them against the West.
[00:21:35.238 --> 00:21:40.240]  We're now deeply into a multi-decades long global program that's public.
[00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:43.435]  The bad news is we were asleep for a long time.
[00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:48.743]  The good news is the Globals were so arrogant because we were asleep, they were very, very honest about their operations.
[00:21:50.233 --> 00:22:15.207]  Now, if you're a long-time listener, how many thousands of times, thousands, have you heard me open the broadcast up that the globalists are above the law, they seek to suppress free market, they seek to make you poor, they seek to control you, they want monopolies, they're tax-exempt, they have diplomatic immunity, and then if you ever understand that, their whole program's done.
[00:22:15.207 --> 00:22:16.188]  And now that's understood.
[00:22:18.083 --> 00:22:28.931]  But to have Bill Maher come out two weeks ago and say that he hopes for an economic collapse.
[00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.892]  They later spun it into a recession.
[00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:33.914]  But economic collapse is what he first said.
[00:22:33.914 --> 00:22:35.756]  Seven million people.
[00:22:35.756 --> 00:22:39.478]  There is a crashing economy is the actual quote.
[00:22:39.478 --> 00:22:44.402]  The major university studies you can look up estimate that seven million people
[00:22:47.847 --> 00:22:53.094]  It's more Jews than died in the Holocaust.
[00:22:53.094 --> 00:22:57.460]  Died during the decade-long Great Depression.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.461]  Decade-plus long.
[00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:01.004]  Thirteen-year-long Great Depression in the United States.
[00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:08.215]  Now, just like Venezuela, where they have over a thousand a week dying according to Amnesty International for starvation, they don't call it that.
[00:23:08.215 --> 00:23:10.916]  But you would get sick because you were starving to death.
[00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:13.556]  You look at the old videos, old footage, there's like thousands lined up.
[00:23:13.556 --> 00:23:14.917]  They're like scarecrows.
[00:23:14.917 --> 00:23:16.177]  Little babies are all skinny.
[00:23:16.177 --> 00:23:17.137]  Never seen skinny babies.
[00:23:17.137 --> 00:23:18.717]  They're like wanting some soup.
[00:23:18.717 --> 00:23:20.938]  I mean, the country collapsed.
[00:23:20.938 --> 00:23:23.118]  And the banks engineered it.
[00:23:23.118 --> 00:23:25.799]  Well, Bill Maher is such a monstrous pig.
[00:23:26.803 --> 00:23:28.184]  He always says, I want abortion.
[00:23:28.184 --> 00:23:29.084]  I want death.
[00:23:29.084 --> 00:23:31.526]  Maybe next time we should play that intro promo.
[00:23:31.526 --> 00:23:32.266]  I forget the name of it.
[00:23:32.266 --> 00:23:32.986]  We've got a bunch of them.
[00:23:32.986 --> 00:23:33.927]  It's just Bill Maher.
[00:23:33.927 --> 00:23:34.647]  I want death.
[00:23:34.647 --> 00:23:35.888]  I want abortion.
[00:23:35.888 --> 00:23:37.749]  I want the highways to move quicker.
[00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:38.770]  It's a really nasty video.
[00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:39.350]  I forget the name of it.
[00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.371]  We haven't aired it in like a year.
[00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:42.532]  He goes on all the time.
[00:23:42.532 --> 00:23:44.513]  I mean, I know people that know him, have been to dinner with him.
[00:23:44.513 --> 00:23:46.234]  I know women that have dated him in Hollywood.
[00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:49.698]  And they're just like, yeah, Bill Maher's a miserable person.
[00:23:49.698 --> 00:23:53.061]  He'll just sit there at dinner and talk about how much he hates Christians.
[00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:57.164]  And people are like, well, I'm not a Christian, but we just, okay, fine.
[00:23:57.164 --> 00:24:02.168]  Like, you want to have a two-hour dinner with him just saying how much he hates Christians, how much he hates America?
[00:24:02.168 --> 00:24:06.131]  But hell, don't, don't listen to me years ago telling you how many people had dinner with him.
[00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.641]  I'm not going to tell the story, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:29.638]  The point is, is that, because it was told to me in confidence, the issue is he tells you he wants to abort you, he wants you to die, he wants you to go away, he tells you he's a vampire, and he tells you that he wants you poor.
[00:24:29.638 --> 00:24:33.583]  And then you wonder why he wants a depression in this country.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.221]  You know, my family in East Texas was well-to-do.
[00:24:39.221 --> 00:24:45.483]  They weren't rich, but they had a lot of land and they were well-known, founding people in that county, Freestone County.
[00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:55.687]  And at the end of the Depression, there were no deer, no possums, no raccoons, anything.
[00:24:55.687 --> 00:25:01.669]  People always made fun of the poor people, whether they be black or white, for eating possum pie.
[00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:04.410]  You know, you watch the Beverly Hillbillies, you hear about possum pie?
[00:25:06.803 --> 00:25:09.327]  That's possum mixing with sweet potatoes.
[00:25:09.327 --> 00:25:11.229]  My dad's had possum pie.
[00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:18.921]  Now, he wasn't starving when he was born in 1950, but they were still going over to their local black folks neighbors and eating possum pie with them.
[00:25:20.441 --> 00:25:24.442]  And it wasn't some like kind of thing about let's go over and see the weird black people eating pasta and pie.
[00:25:24.442 --> 00:25:27.163]  They were eating pasta and pie too during the depression.
[00:25:27.163 --> 00:25:30.844]  It was going remembering folks who survived together during that.
[00:25:30.844 --> 00:25:35.325]  The black people just all completely loved, they're all dead now, all loved us.
[00:25:35.325 --> 00:25:36.165]  And we loved them.
[00:25:36.165 --> 00:25:44.668]  It was a totally different culture than what the media says or any of this crap.
[00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:45.648]  But I digress from that.
[00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:51.887]  People, 90% of people in the Great Depression were rural.
[00:25:51.887 --> 00:25:54.731]  And they estimated about half of them were self-sufficient.
[00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:58.237]  So, around 45% of people could 100% be self-sufficient.
[00:25:58.237 --> 00:25:58.837]  90% were rural.
[00:25:58.837 --> 00:25:58.998]  Today,
[00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:14.729]  We are 90% rural, 10%, 9% urban, city, 10% rural, and only half of the rural are self-sufficient.
[00:26:14.729 --> 00:26:20.110]  So, 5% are self-sufficient today versus 40 plus percent.
[00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.491]  What happens if there's another depression?
[00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:26.972]  War in the streets, total death, collapse beyond Venezuela.
[00:26:27.692 --> 00:26:30.134]  Venezuela was still mainly agrarian when they collapsed.
[00:26:30.134 --> 00:26:35.777]  So they've just had, you know, hundreds of thousands starved to death, and tens of thousands killed, and it's horrible, and they eat all their dogs and cats.
[00:26:35.777 --> 00:26:45.464]  But it will be like the road, Viggo Mortensen's road, meets Grapes of Wrath if this happens here.
[00:26:45.464 --> 00:26:55.771]  And you've got this creature, who's got a hundred million dollars in private jet, saying he wants a depression, saying he wants a collapse.
[00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:56.091]  Here it is.
[00:26:59.443 --> 00:27:01.124]  Can I ask about the economy?
[00:27:01.124 --> 00:27:03.486]  Because this economy is going pretty well.
[00:27:03.486 --> 00:27:05.007]  We have to... what?
[00:27:05.007 --> 00:27:06.608]  We have to know.
[00:27:06.608 --> 00:27:08.069]  It is going well for now.
[00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:08.730]  For now, right.
[00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.432]  That's my question.
[00:27:12.432 --> 00:27:15.014]  I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.
[00:27:15.014 --> 00:27:16.855]  And by the way, I'm hoping for it.
[00:27:16.855 --> 00:27:20.398]  Because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy.
[00:27:20.398 --> 00:27:22.019]  So please, bring on the recession.
[00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:29.508]  Now, I haven't had time to edit this, so it's got a cuss word for internet viewers and stuff.
[00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:34.071]  We'll delay it for TV and radio, but he just basically says, I defend this.
[00:27:34.071 --> 00:27:39.495]  You guys need to go back to college and learn about comparison, because Trump's worse than a Great Depression.
[00:27:39.495 --> 00:27:40.155]  So, here's a clip.
[00:27:45.004 --> 00:27:50.970]  Because I said going through a recession would be worth it if it undermined Trump's popularity.
[00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.034]  Has to enroll in college and take a course in perspective.
[00:27:55.034 --> 00:27:56.555]  A recession.
[00:27:56.555 --> 00:27:56.996]  Back it up.
[00:27:56.996 --> 00:28:00.098]  Great job delaying that line.
[00:28:00.098 --> 00:28:02.140]  A course in perspective.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.662]  You've got a hundred million.
[00:28:03.662 --> 00:28:04.963]  You've got private jets.
[00:28:04.963 --> 00:28:07.525]  You don't think it'll hurt people to have no money for a few years.
[00:28:08.655 --> 00:28:13.759]  And so you lecture us from your filthy Hollywood pulpit, like we're a bunch of crap.
[00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.081]  You need the perspective, man.
[00:28:15.081 --> 00:28:17.803]  You jerk.
[00:28:17.803 --> 00:28:18.584]  God, man.
[00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:21.386]  I mean, just this is the trash that runs Hollywood.
[00:28:21.386 --> 00:28:27.911]  Let's hear from this anti-American guy betting on our failure, and he thinks we're so dumb, he'll spit it in our face.
[00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:29.112]  He'll spit it in our face.
[00:28:29.112 --> 00:28:29.413]  Here it is.
[00:28:30.888 --> 00:28:34.471]  Has to enroll in college and take a course in perspective.
[00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:34.952]  Hit pause.
[00:28:34.952 --> 00:28:36.853]  I'm gonna come back to him.
[00:28:36.853 --> 00:28:43.339]  Hey, why don't you enroll in a college of humanity, you sociopathic genetic psychopath?
[00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:46.782]  Why don't you get off our back, you dirty dirtbag?
[00:28:46.782 --> 00:28:51.427]  If you hate America so much, just get the hell out of here.
[00:28:51.427 --> 00:28:52.988]  Do you think there's too many people?
[00:28:52.988 --> 00:28:57.112]  Then slit your own wrist, shove a gun in your mouth, and blow your filthy brains everywhere.
[00:29:02.265 --> 00:29:07.988]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:29:07.988 --> 00:29:15.873]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:29:15.873 --> 00:29:19.015]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:24.479]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:27.261]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:29:27.261 --> 00:29:36.248]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:29:36.288 --> 00:29:41.151]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:10.503]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:30:10.503 --> 00:30:19.209]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:30:19.209 --> 00:30:23.792]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:25.253]  You are the info war.
[00:30:25.253 --> 00:30:28.775]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:30:29.455 --> 00:30:40.844]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:30:40.844 --> 00:30:48.810]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.

[00:31:58.689 --> 00:32:02.292]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:32:02.292 --> 00:32:04.053]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:16.223]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:32:16.223 --> 00:32:21.127]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:31.250]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:37.052]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:32:37.052 --> 00:32:45.494]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:32:45.714 --> 00:32:47.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:33.354 --> 00:33:36.620]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones and Bill Maher says he hopes you die.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:36.960]  Here it is.
[00:33:38.314 --> 00:33:40.515]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:33:40.515 --> 00:33:42.395]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:43.716]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:33:43.716 --> 00:33:45.456]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:49.878]  He is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[00:33:49.878 --> 00:33:56.940]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.342]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:34:01.342 --> 00:34:07.644]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:34:15.828 --> 00:34:18.449]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:23.330]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.851]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:35.213]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:34:35.213 --> 00:34:37.694]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:34:40.486 --> 00:34:41.987]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:34:41.987 --> 00:34:45.710]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.532]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:34:49.532 --> 00:34:52.975]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:34:52.975 --> 00:34:54.736]  We gotta stop them somehow!
[00:34:54.736 --> 00:34:59.740]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.362]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:35:02.362 --> 00:35:03.002]  We're trying.
[00:35:03.002 --> 00:35:05.204]  We're trying, Chuck.
[00:35:05.204 --> 00:35:05.804]  Trump's trying.
[00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:06.785]  We're trying to stop it.
[00:35:09.226 --> 00:35:13.169]  But that's what globalism is, it's made out of people.
[00:35:13.169 --> 00:35:16.371]  Now, if you just joined us, I'm gonna finish up what I was covering.
[00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:26.979]  Bill Maher, Mr. Infanticide, Mr. Abortion, Mr. Suicide, who loves you so much, Trump hates the children, remember?
[00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:35.126]  Even though the girl wasn't separated from her parents, it was all a hoax, and even though Tom Arnold didn't get Trump's lawyer to say all this and admits it's a lie now, doesn't matter!
[00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:40.533]  Because they've got a new lie every five minutes before you discover the other one.
[00:35:40.533 --> 00:35:43.214]  And they just move on to try to control reality.
[00:35:43.214 --> 00:35:43.914]  So what do you do?
[00:35:43.914 --> 00:35:45.174]  I don't know.
[00:35:45.174 --> 00:35:47.315]  That's a question I should open the phones up about.
[00:35:47.315 --> 00:35:49.195]  What do you do about liars like this?
[00:35:49.195 --> 00:35:53.256]  In fact, I'm gonna open the phones up on that question only.
[00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:56.497]  Do you ignore the lies?
[00:35:56.497 --> 00:35:58.418]  And just tell the truth about other stuff that's going on?
[00:35:58.418 --> 00:36:02.999]  Or do you counter the lies but then let them to control the debate where they're always roping us in?
[00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:11.973]  Yeah, I forgot he said the people that took down the World Trade Center were heroes and had courage.
[00:36:11.973 --> 00:36:13.174]  I forgot Bill Maher praised that.
[00:36:13.174 --> 00:36:14.175]  God!
[00:36:14.175 --> 00:36:16.056]  There's no end to that, guys.
[00:36:16.056 --> 00:36:27.063]  Anyways... But see, when you prey on something like America, you have to hate it, or you'd feel bad.
[00:36:27.063 --> 00:36:30.045]  So, just finishing up, here's Bill Maher.
[00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:33.467]  Two weeks ago, says he wants a collapsing economy.
[00:36:33.467 --> 00:36:34.327]  What was the exact quote?
[00:36:34.327 --> 00:36:34.868]  It was, uh...
[00:36:36.542 --> 00:36:38.384]  Stock market crash.
[00:36:38.384 --> 00:36:39.825]  Economic crash was the quote, right?
[00:36:39.825 --> 00:36:40.445]  There it is.
[00:36:40.445 --> 00:36:41.506]  A crashing economy.
[00:36:41.506 --> 00:36:43.708]  There's the exact quote.
[00:36:43.708 --> 00:36:44.749]  Which is not a recession.
[00:36:44.749 --> 00:36:47.451]  That's far worse.
[00:36:47.451 --> 00:36:48.732]  We couldn't survive it.
[00:36:48.732 --> 00:36:51.675]  This sophisticated of an economy with just-on-time delivery and everything?
[00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:52.976]  I mean, the Pentagon studied it.
[00:36:52.976 --> 00:36:53.736]  Everybody else has.
[00:36:53.736 --> 00:36:56.378]  It's like, we can't have one of those.
[00:36:56.378 --> 00:36:59.561]  And a sophisticated economy tends to stop a depression.
[00:36:59.561 --> 00:37:00.522]  But if you have one,
[00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:07.230]  You better be in a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere with 50 cows on the roof.
[00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.410]  Which I haven't even set up yet.
[00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.852]  You know, I realize that I'm running up the white flag when I get that set up.
[00:37:11.852 --> 00:37:14.113]  Man, I'm so close, man.
[00:37:14.113 --> 00:37:15.473]  I'm so close to bugging out.
[00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:19.375]  I'll still do the show, but I'll admit, like, I bugged out.
[00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:23.637]  I'm in an undisclosed location because all the billionaires have run to armored redoubts.
[00:37:23.637 --> 00:37:24.637]  Even the patriot ones, I know.
[00:37:24.637 --> 00:37:28.078]  They're like, hey, you want to space down here in the bunker?
[00:37:28.078 --> 00:37:31.100]  And I'm like, no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.700]  But you know what?
[00:37:33.362 --> 00:37:40.465]  I look at the spoiled rotten public that doesn't even want prosperity and Trump trying to stop a global collapse, which we're so close to, and I'm kind of like, what do I do?
[00:37:40.465 --> 00:37:42.226]  You know?
[00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:48.809]  At a certain point, I've got to just, not even throw in the towel, just be honest about things.
[00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:49.929]  But I'm not doing it yet.
[00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:52.490]  Because we're winning right now.
[00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.231]  And people should be trying to fix things.
[00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:58.173]  If we tried to fix things, we may not have a chance to turn this around.
[00:37:58.173 --> 00:38:01.174]  I mean, we're 7.5 billion people on a little bitty planet.
[00:38:03.183 --> 00:38:08.345]  You can fly halfway around it in 10 hours.
[00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:13.786]  And then we've got jerks that maintain control through dyscordia?
[00:38:13.786 --> 00:38:15.487]  Like Bill Maher?
[00:38:15.487 --> 00:38:22.829]  Who's got an impetus to hate people?
[00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:24.310]  I would never hurt Bill Maher.
[00:38:25.828 --> 00:38:37.355]  I'm simply saying if Bill Maher wants to talk about how he wants infanticide and euthanasia so that he doesn't get big cities get built because of big populations.
[00:38:37.355 --> 00:38:43.019]  I've told you a thousand times it's a good analogy like you may go a hundred miles, 200 miles in the oceans and you hit a coral reef.
[00:38:44.875 --> 00:38:49.558]  The right temperature, the right atmosphere, the right areas.
[00:38:49.558 --> 00:38:52.920]  Maybe a river's coming out that feeds it with flora and food.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:58.724]  And you'll have a big coral reef, like Belize or the largest coral reef in the world, Australia.
[00:39:01.127 --> 00:39:04.009]  And if you're swimming along, you're like, God, look at all these fish!
[00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:05.310]  There's so many of them!
[00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.591]  This is overcrowded!
[00:39:06.591 --> 00:39:08.473]  Life congregates.
[00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:14.417]  But here's this psycho that's just like, God, this whole city could be mine, and I could just kill everybody.
[00:39:14.417 --> 00:39:16.499]  If they were all dead and poor, I'd rule them.
[00:39:16.499 --> 00:39:21.803]  I mean, he doesn't even get people built in.
[00:39:21.803 --> 00:39:25.066]  It's like going, damn, this restaurant, it's got a line up the door.
[00:39:25.066 --> 00:39:26.167]  It's because it's good.
[00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:36.241]  It's like all these former CIA people going, Trump's Hitler.
[00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:37.744]  Trump's Hitler.
[00:39:37.744 --> 00:39:39.667]  No, people are trying to get into the U.S., not out of it.
[00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:43.975]  And the whole leftist movement is funded by George Soros.
[00:39:43.975 --> 00:39:45.195]  We all know who he worked for.
[00:39:45.195 --> 00:39:48.415]  So, the irony is rich, but I got a lot to cover.
[00:39:48.415 --> 00:39:53.596]  Let's just get to this clip, see if we can edit it in live time as he cusses.
[00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:55.697]  Again, the gods of HBO can cuss.
[00:39:55.697 --> 00:39:57.017]  We're a broadcast.
[00:39:57.017 --> 00:39:57.577]  We understand.
[00:39:57.577 --> 00:39:58.657]  They're better than us.
[00:39:58.657 --> 00:40:02.978]  So we better be real careful, because the left will all complain if they hear a cuss word and try to get us off the air.
[00:40:02.978 --> 00:40:05.179]  They all love it when they do it, but they say, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:05.659]  It's who they are.
[00:40:05.659 --> 00:40:06.419]  They're trash.
[00:40:06.419 --> 00:40:06.739]  Here it is.
[00:40:07.795 --> 00:40:21.051]  And finally, new rule, anyone who went age-wise last two weeks because I said going through a recession would be worth it if it undermined Trump's popularity, has to enroll in college and take a course in perspective.
[00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.815]  A recession is a survivable event.
[00:40:23.815 --> 00:40:26.338]  What Trump is doing to this country is not.
[00:40:29.745 --> 00:40:30.865]  Back it up again.
[00:40:30.865 --> 00:40:33.047]  And all his lapdogs who want to run things.
[00:40:33.047 --> 00:40:34.127]  They're the elite.
[00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:34.868]  They're in power.
[00:40:34.868 --> 00:40:35.828]  They're all these losers.
[00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:36.349]  They're ugly.
[00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.949]  They're stupid.
[00:40:36.949 --> 00:40:42.192]  But they're in charge because a bunch of soulless corporate guys put them on air because they're dicks.
[00:40:42.192 --> 00:40:46.074]  Okay?
[00:40:46.074 --> 00:40:49.176]  You want to have an economic collapse is what you said.
[00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:52.458]  Now you whitewash it into recession.
[00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:55.120]  And then you're sitting up there with a hundred million dollars like we're all idiots.
[00:40:56.237 --> 00:40:58.557]  And you're saying, oh, you need to go to college.
[00:40:58.557 --> 00:41:00.438]  The condescension.
[00:41:00.438 --> 00:41:01.738]  You need to go to college.
[00:41:01.738 --> 00:41:02.538]  I'm Bill Maher.
[00:41:02.538 --> 00:41:03.178]  I'm a human.
[00:41:03.178 --> 00:41:04.238]  You're an animal.
[00:41:04.238 --> 00:41:06.219]  You're trash.
[00:41:06.219 --> 00:41:08.419]  I'm Bill Maher.
[00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:10.839]  How dare you not like me rooting against America?
[00:41:10.839 --> 00:41:12.080]  How about this question, Bill?
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.920]  How come the economy came back and is at 3 plus percent when they said it could never happen?
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.541]  Krauthammer and others said... Not Krauthammer.
[00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:24.122]  Who's the guy at the New York Times, the economist?
[00:41:24.122 --> 00:41:25.282]  Krauthammer's a good guy.
[00:41:26.198 --> 00:41:26.678]  Krugman.
[00:41:26.678 --> 00:41:27.098]  Krugman.
[00:41:27.098 --> 00:41:28.159]  People get it wrong.
[00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:28.519]  Yeah.
[00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:29.459]  It could never happen.
[00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:31.279]  And a magic wand Obama.
[00:41:31.279 --> 00:41:35.001]  How do you guys not get that?
[00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:35.201]  See?
[00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:39.722]  Because if he's such a big loser, how'd he kick your ass?
[00:41:39.722 --> 00:41:42.403]  You condescending shrumpet.
[00:41:42.403 --> 00:41:45.264]  I mean, what a schmuck, man.
[00:41:45.264 --> 00:41:49.785]  I mean, Bill Maher in the encyclopedia or anywhere.
[00:41:51.461 --> 00:42:00.668]  He should be, in a dictionary, schmuck, and there's a picture of him, because this guy is so condescending, and he's like, oh, Trump's such a loser.
[00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:00.948]  Really?
[00:42:00.948 --> 00:42:03.730]  No, he went against the crowd.
[00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.212]  Let's go ahead and, we need to do search Bing, not Google.
[00:42:06.212 --> 00:42:07.673]  I hate Google, they're a fake search engine.
[00:42:07.673 --> 00:42:11.375]  Let's go to it, here it is.
[00:42:11.375 --> 00:42:13.597]  Person perspective.
[00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:16.359]  A recession is a survivable event.
[00:42:16.359 --> 00:42:18.861]  What Trump is doing to this country is not.
[00:42:20.723 --> 00:42:26.527]  I'm so lucky I was born to be lectured by the ugly roadkill that's Bill Maher.
[00:42:26.527 --> 00:42:28.929]  Hey Bill, if we should all die, show the example first.
[00:42:28.929 --> 00:42:34.032]  He's about to go the way of the dinosaurs because we've been taken over by a dodo bird.
[00:42:34.032 --> 00:42:38.075]  Oh, every week we're cavemen, we're old, we're dead.
[00:42:38.075 --> 00:42:40.377]  No, you're gone, you're done.
[00:42:40.377 --> 00:42:41.598]  You want us to commit suicide?
[00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:44.240]  I tell you what, lead the way.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:53.589]  If you'll shove a gun, I hope you don't do it, but he always wants to die, you call for it, so if you shove a gun in your mouth and blow the top of your head off, I'll think about it for five minutes.
[00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:56.873]  And then I'll piss all over your ugly stinking grave, you maggot!

[00:47:11.806 --> 00:47:18.891]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people, and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:47:18.891 --> 00:47:21.133]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:33.722]  We love the American people.
[00:47:33.722 --> 00:47:35.964]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:47:35.964 --> 00:47:37.465]  We love the American people.
[00:47:37.465 --> 00:47:38.846]  We love the American people.
[00:47:40.785 --> 00:47:43.187]  We love the American people.
[00:47:43.187 --> 00:47:57.101]  They came in peace.
[00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:59.283]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:47:59.283 --> 00:48:01.165]  We love the American people.
[00:48:08.493 --> 00:48:13.978]  This is CNN.
[00:48:13.978 --> 00:48:19.662]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:48:19.662 --> 00:48:30.831]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are.
[00:48:30.831 --> 00:48:37.617]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[00:48:39.451 --> 00:48:59.426]  Harpin' on the wars we fight, drivin' about the way things ought to be And I don't mind them switchin' sides and standin' up for things they believe in But when they're runnin' down our country, they're walkin' on the fightin' side of me
[00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:18.536]  Democracy is about to go the way of the dinosaurs because we've been taken over by a dodo bird.
[00:49:18.536 --> 00:49:23.300]  So, let me repeat, recessions are survivable events.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.163]  We survive one every time a Republican is in the White House.
[00:49:26.163 --> 00:49:28.485]  It's true.
[00:49:32.327 --> 00:49:37.050]  Every Republican president since Teddy Roosevelt has presided over a recession.
[00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:41.213]  Four Republican presidents had two of them, and Eisenhower had three.
[00:49:41.213 --> 00:49:46.136]  The United States has survived 47 recessions in all.
[00:49:46.136 --> 00:49:49.878]  And since the Great Depression, we've never gone more than 10 years without one.
[00:49:49.878 --> 00:49:51.720]  Another recession is coming.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.802]  Not because I'm rooting for it, because someone
[00:49:58.493 --> 00:50:12.596]  Someone passed a giant tax giveaway to the rich that added trillions to the debt and started a trade war for no reason and deliberately sabotaged the Affordable Care Act and rolled back the rules for banks so they can once again gamble with our money.
[00:50:12.596 --> 00:50:16.917]  Those are actual policies from men with real power.
[00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:18.798]  As opposed to me, who just made a wish!
[00:50:18.798 --> 00:50:22.419]  I just made a wish!
[00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:23.119]  Am I a genie?
[00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:23.579]  I just...
[00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:47.000]  But you would never know that from the right-wing Nuttosphere, where this made me a bigger threat to our national security than Canada.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.963]  Anyways, I don't normally play this much of Bill Maher.
[00:50:50.963 --> 00:50:54.266]  It's just, it's so disgusting how he's rooting for the fall of America.
[00:50:54.266 --> 00:50:56.107]  And it really makes me sick.
[00:50:56.107 --> 00:50:57.288]  And in the clip I wanted to play...
[00:50:59.033 --> 00:51:07.696]  It comes up later is where he attacks Mike Cernovich pointing out what the Wall Street Journal reports in suicide rates spike during recessions.
[00:51:07.696 --> 00:51:10.337]  And then he goes, great, commit suicide.
[00:51:10.337 --> 00:51:16.439]  So it's the dirtiness, the nastiness of the Democrats always saying we should kill ourselves.
[00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:17.699]  And I'm like, you go first.
[00:51:17.699 --> 00:51:19.580]  I don't want Bill Maher to kill himself.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.861]  I'm saying he should go first.
[00:51:20.861 --> 00:51:23.461]  But see, he's a nasty person.
[00:51:23.461 --> 00:51:27.143]  And for some reason, we bow down to that like it's cool.
[00:51:27.143 --> 00:51:27.903]  Like it's powerful.
[00:51:29.858 --> 00:51:34.320]  Like he should be in charge.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:47.246]  And now the very same people are on the news telling us that Trump was mean to a girl at the border and took her away from her mommy.
[00:51:47.246 --> 00:51:51.487]  And then in that case, it's not even true.
[00:51:51.487 --> 00:51:52.608]  And then Tom Arnold,
[00:51:55.953 --> 00:51:58.334]  Comes out and says, I met with Trump's lawyer.
[00:51:58.334 --> 00:51:59.975]  He said he's gonna burn Trump.
[00:51:59.975 --> 00:52:01.435]  He's joining forces with me.
[00:52:01.435 --> 00:52:04.616]  He's got all this criminal evidence that he did these horrible things.
[00:52:04.616 --> 00:52:08.098]  And the minute I saw it, I knew it wasn't true.
[00:52:08.098 --> 00:52:16.541]  They've already admitted that they got everything Cohen had, gave it to the media three months ago, two and a half months ago, and then there was nothing there.
[00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:19.522]  Except Sean Hannity consulting him on something.
[00:52:19.522 --> 00:52:21.963]  I mean, it was crazy.
[00:52:21.963 --> 00:52:24.004]  And then Tom Arnold has to come out and says, okay,
[00:52:25.836 --> 00:52:27.236]  It's not true.
[00:52:27.236 --> 00:52:31.197]  But see, people only remember what was on Friday.
[00:52:31.197 --> 00:52:33.578]  They don't remember what was on June 24th.
[00:52:33.578 --> 00:52:35.259]  They remember what was on June 22nd.
[00:52:35.259 --> 00:52:45.521]  And then I saw CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Houston TV, I was just going through news articles, going, oh, Tom Arnold trolled Trump.
[00:52:45.521 --> 00:52:48.322]  Ah, it's funny.
[00:52:48.322 --> 00:52:51.003]  So they had to bring a comedian on, some failed
[00:52:52.535 --> 00:52:57.756]  Hollywood washed up mental patient douchebag.
[00:52:57.756 --> 00:53:11.699]  They gotta bring him on to then lie and say, oh, I got a selfie with Trump's lawyer and he says he's going public and the media runs that like, Trump's falling, Trump's falling, Trump's falling.
[00:53:11.699 --> 00:53:18.980]  While we have the former, two former heads of the NSA,
[00:53:21.052 --> 00:53:25.596]  Coming out and saying they're going to overthrow the president.
[00:53:25.596 --> 00:53:33.343]  Coming out and saying that they want the 25th amendment and they're threatening the cabinet and threatening everybody in his family and everyone around them.
[00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:38.107]  Believe me, I've already experienced it and I'm like a tear down from the president.
[00:53:38.107 --> 00:53:39.529]  And they've introduced the 25th amendment.
[00:53:40.455 --> 00:53:55.164]  To overthrow the election the American people had, and the economy's coming back, and all these other good things are happening, and peace deals are being made, and secret technologies are being released, and medical treatments and cures, and all this suppressed stuff.
[00:53:57.515 --> 00:54:16.213]  And then Tom Arnold and Bill Maher and Hillary, these fossils, I don't mean they're fossils because they're old, they're just establishment fossils creeping around like dinosaurs, you know, in modern era, and it's like, just get out of my life!
[00:54:16.974 --> 00:54:20.596]  So I'm going to give the number out right now for long-time callers.
[00:54:20.596 --> 00:54:21.356]  I gave it out earlier.
[00:54:21.356 --> 00:54:22.056]  You may have missed it.
[00:54:22.056 --> 00:54:25.578]  I know the phones are loaded, but we have the phone system turned on.
[00:54:25.578 --> 00:54:27.339]  So I'm going to give you the number again.
[00:54:27.339 --> 00:54:29.720]  Phones are open now.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:36.623]  And we're going to take your calls next hour about one issue.
[00:54:36.623 --> 00:54:38.744]  That means on this issue, I'm not going to take your call.
[00:54:38.744 --> 00:54:39.865]  Because I want to hear what you have to say about
[00:54:41.212 --> 00:55:08.296]  Brennan and Clapper and all the rest of them saying they're going to overthrow the president and the president's a Nazi and all this made-up crap and and and all and the fake little girl that was given to her mother and it was never taken from her mother and just all these hoaxes and Tom Arnold that no one's heard about in 20 years and was a loser when he was heard about Some groom of the stool for Arnold Schwarzenegger
[00:55:12.082 --> 00:55:16.363]  He's out putting out lies and then everyone, oh my God, Tom Arnold says this, it must be true.
[00:55:16.363 --> 00:55:18.403]  And then it's a lie, but it's a footnote.
[00:55:18.403 --> 00:55:24.165]  What is your take on the state of the attempt to cause a civil war in this country in their own admissions?
[00:55:24.165 --> 00:55:29.846]  And to go out and, we've got the Maxine Waters clips, they're on Infowars.com, they're on Newswars.com.
[00:55:29.846 --> 00:55:32.026]  Drudge has got them, let's put Drudge on screen if we can.
[00:55:32.026 --> 00:55:39.208]  You know, up there, her calling for insurrection, her calling for harassing Republicans, her saying, why we booed the Homeland Security head.
[00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:44.044]  And then Trump actually does what I think he should.
[00:55:44.044 --> 00:55:49.570]  I'm not mad at him, but he says, okay, we'll try to not separate kids, even though it doesn't even happen 10% of the time.
[00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:56.357]  You're going to throw kids in general population with a bunch of who knows what?
[00:55:56.357 --> 00:55:57.758]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:55:57.758 --> 00:56:00.061]  And then they double down and go, we want totally open borders.
[00:56:01.175 --> 00:56:08.080]  Just like Trump said, and I was told this by high-level folks, they said, listen, we're going to tell them, tell us what you want, we support gun control.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.543]  And they went, we want total bans of all guns, everything turned in, and it blew it up.
[00:56:12.543 --> 00:56:16.525]  And I was sitting there talking to high-level people, you know, as high as it gets, and I was like, you think this will work?
[00:56:16.525 --> 00:56:18.026]  And they go, just trust us.
[00:56:18.026 --> 00:56:19.767]  And they did it.
[00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:22.489]  Notice that gun grab thing's gone now, because they said, we want everything.
[00:56:22.489 --> 00:56:24.691]  Same thing here, we want total open borders, we want everything.
[00:56:25.802 --> 00:56:29.763]  So that's what Trump's doing with them, and it's crazy town.
[00:56:29.763 --> 00:56:31.084]  So that's coming up.
[00:56:31.084 --> 00:56:33.165]  Pull a free number to join us.
[00:56:33.165 --> 00:56:33.465]  877-789-ALEX.

[00:56:33.625 --> 00:56:34.285]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:56:34.285 --> 00:56:42.288]  And I want to hear from you specifically on them trying to cause a civil war.
[00:56:42.288 --> 00:56:45.529]  Here's the article up on Infowars.com from The Hill.
[00:56:45.529 --> 00:56:49.371]  Ex-CIA Chief Calls on White House Cabinet to Revolt Against Trump.
[00:56:49.371 --> 00:56:50.371]  That's the 25th Amendment.
[00:56:50.371 --> 00:56:52.652]  We'll document it all coming up.
[00:56:54.224 --> 00:56:57.825]  On the other side, but meanwhile, it ties into this little baby.
[00:56:57.825 --> 00:57:01.847]  Mass exodus from states run by top Democrat governors continues.
[00:57:01.847 --> 00:57:03.427]  That's a fact.
[00:57:03.427 --> 00:57:05.988]  Everybody's running away from this.
[00:57:05.988 --> 00:57:13.911]  Whether it's Venezuela, or Russia, or North Korea, or whether it's Cuba, or whether it's all the other countries that did it, they know this.
[00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:16.112]  They know.
[00:57:16.112 --> 00:57:20.233]  You look into the EU heads, these Democrats, they are all richer than anybody else.
[00:57:20.233 --> 00:57:22.594]  Democrats got 77% of the wealth in Congress.
[00:57:23.334 --> 00:57:26.337]  They don't pay for this, but they want you to stay poor.
[00:57:26.337 --> 00:57:27.938]  And they're trying to stop this recovery.
[00:57:27.938 --> 00:57:38.806]  Speaking of funding our operation, we have got super sales going on right now that are brand new sales on our colloil silver iodine fortified toothpaste.

[00:59:52.323 --> 00:59:54.964]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.925 --> 01:00:04.525]  Show!
[01:00:24.696 --> 01:00:29.418]  If you thought corporate establishment media could get any worse, you were right.
[01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:46.727]  They have gone to the next level of just tripling down on deception, tripling down on insanity, tripling down on bizarre activity, saying this little girl was separated from her parents when she wasn't, saying that we're all Nazis that voted for Trump, which is just totally ridiculous, and now go out and harass everybody.
[01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:48.788]  You've got Maxine Waters, you know, praising all this.
[01:00:48.788 --> 01:00:49.848]  That's coming up.
[01:00:49.848 --> 01:00:51.369]  I never spend this much time on Bill Maher.
[01:00:52.711 --> 01:00:55.633]  Two weeks ago, I guess he has a show every two weeks now.
[01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:58.456]  It's good for 10 million a year selling out America.
[01:00:58.456 --> 01:01:02.259]  He came out and he said, I'm hoping for an economic collapse.
[01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:05.322]  And then they spun that, oh, I want a recession.
[01:01:05.322 --> 01:01:07.323]  And then now he doubled down and said, you're idiots.
[01:01:07.323 --> 01:01:08.004]  Go to college.
[01:01:08.004 --> 01:01:09.545]  Trump's worse than a recession.
[01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:10.246]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:10.246 --> 01:01:11.186]  I'm God.
[01:01:11.186 --> 01:01:13.048]  Bow down and kiss my butt.
[01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:13.829]  My Hollywood ass.
[01:01:15.353 --> 01:01:17.435]  But then, I hadn't even watched the whole clip.
[01:01:17.435 --> 01:01:19.477]  I'd just seen the short clip where he said that.
[01:01:19.477 --> 01:01:20.398]  They checked the clip.
[01:01:20.398 --> 01:01:24.223]  He attacks Mike Cernovich, myself, everybody.
[01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:25.684]  Let's just hear the clip for yourself.
[01:01:25.684 --> 01:01:35.915]  It's unbelievable, the nastiness of this anti-human, anti-American guy that says he wants abortion, suicide, just a pro-death dirtbag.
[01:01:35.915 --> 01:01:36.276]  Here he is.
[01:01:38.897 --> 01:01:45.822]  Alex Jones tweeted, Bill Maher is worth $100 million, but he says we should crash the US economy to stop Trump.
[01:01:45.822 --> 01:01:48.184]  And when has he ever strayed from the facts?
[01:01:48.184 --> 01:01:50.265]  Wait a minute, pause.
[01:01:50.265 --> 01:01:54.148]  He just earlier in the same monologue admitted it.
[01:01:54.148 --> 01:01:55.289]  This is next level.
[01:01:55.289 --> 01:01:56.730]  Continue.
[01:01:56.730 --> 01:02:00.192]  And then everyone on the right said, I had $100 million.
[01:02:00.192 --> 01:02:03.155]  And all I have to say about that is, I do?
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.701]  You got a 10 million dollar a year contract.
[01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:08.581]  That's awesome.
[01:02:08.581 --> 01:02:12.883]  And you've made over 200 million.
[01:02:12.883 --> 01:02:16.104]  Yeah, you're a Hollywood crap bag.
[01:02:16.104 --> 01:02:17.564]  So Alex Jones is a kid.
[01:02:17.564 --> 01:02:21.385]  No, you said it, you son of a piece of filth.
[01:02:21.385 --> 01:02:23.466]  Sarah Palin tweeted to her follower.
[01:02:23.466 --> 01:02:28.368]  You're the losers.
[01:02:30.649 --> 01:02:39.095]  That I was out of touch, and Wayne Allen Root said, he doesn't care if your kids starve.
[01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:40.596]  Yeah, that's what it means to have a depression, a-hole.
[01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:43.278]  Mike Cernovich said, suicides increase during recessions.
[01:02:43.278 --> 01:02:47.462]  Bill Maher wants people to die.
[01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:55.588]  Yes, specifically Mike Cernovich.
[01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:59.390]  I want him to put his head in the oven so starving kids confuse it for food.
[01:03:02.225 --> 01:03:03.947]  No, I don't want that.
[01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.668]  I don't know who the fuck you are, Mike Cernovich.
[01:03:05.668 --> 01:03:06.669]  Oh, pause it.
[01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:08.231]  Let's hit pause.
[01:03:08.231 --> 01:03:08.911]  Let's delete that.
[01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:15.217]  You don't know, yeah, you don't know who Mike Cernovich is because he independently has hundreds of millions of views a month.
[01:03:15.217 --> 01:03:23.524]  Yeah, buddy, you're propped up and force-fed on YouTube and your average show has a couple million views.
[01:03:23.524 --> 01:03:25.786]  You're a joke.
[01:03:25.786 --> 01:03:27.848]  And that's why I get mad for my old friend.
[01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:41.389]  Maybe post-mortem friend Joe Rogan, I don't know if he's physically dead, but as a friend, that, you know, they don't shadow ban him, they don't block him, because now he backhands all the liberty movement and the patriots, and he says, oh, I'm just an entertainer.
[01:03:41.389 --> 01:03:48.233]  Well, he does it, and he just kind of joins the ranks of Bill Maher, who also says that George Soros was captured by the Nazis.
[01:03:49.881 --> 01:03:54.503]  So, Bill Maher is a non-intellectual, and he's actually rather dumb.
[01:03:54.503 --> 01:03:55.544]  Just look at his past.
[01:03:55.544 --> 01:03:56.384]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:56.384 --> 01:03:58.625]  That's Trump four, five years ago saying that.
[01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.327]  So, here's the deal.
[01:04:01.327 --> 01:04:04.768]  I'm not trying to win the candy-ass award here with everybody.
[01:04:04.768 --> 01:04:06.789]  I'm trying to change the world.
[01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:10.691]  And so, anybody that joins with the system and pushes his crap, I'm done with you.
[01:04:10.691 --> 01:04:11.492]  But let me tell you something.
[01:04:11.492 --> 01:04:16.014]  Mike Cernovich ought to be proud that Bill Maher says he wants him to kill himself.
[01:04:18.348 --> 01:04:20.870]  Again, I don't want Bill Maher to commit suicide.
[01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:26.936]  I said, if you want us to die, just put that right up front in the last four or five clips when we put the tape later.
[01:04:26.936 --> 01:04:30.960]  We're live right now, but I mean, I'm sure there'll be articles today or tomorrow.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.682]  Jones wants Bill Maher to die.
[01:04:33.682 --> 01:04:36.785]  No, I said, if you want us all to die, you should do it first.
[01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:38.727]  Meanwhile, he's saying, I want to kill you.
[01:04:38.727 --> 01:04:39.788]  I want to kill your family.
[01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:40.889]  I want to kill Mike Cernovich.
[01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:46.226]  God, I mean, the dude has murder on his brain.
[01:04:46.226 --> 01:04:47.547]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:04:47.547 --> 01:04:50.468]  Bill Maher is possessed by death.
[01:04:50.468 --> 01:04:52.129]  Bill Maher is death.
[01:04:52.129 --> 01:04:52.669]  Well, guess what?
[01:04:52.669 --> 01:04:55.410]  There ain't much room for death in the universe, jackass.
[01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:57.591]  Death's the end, not the beginning.
[01:04:57.591 --> 01:05:03.834]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:06:07.529 --> 01:06:09.790]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:17.572]  I know what they'll find, it's in their mind, it's what they want to see.
[01:06:17.572 --> 01:06:36.237]  Spreading from the rain, here comes the night, and here I'll stay, waiting for darkness.
[01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:41.548]  Well, the sun has set on the globalists.
[01:06:41.548 --> 01:06:51.290]  There'll be other tyrannies to face, like the Nazis before, like the communists, but this corporate form of tyranny is in decline.
[01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:54.091]  Doesn't matter that we'll be dealing with it for decades.
[01:06:54.091 --> 01:06:55.871]  The point is, the worm has turned.
[01:06:55.871 --> 01:07:06.654]  I want to take phone calls, and I got some special reports coming up, where I get into the public announcement by the Democrats and former CIA directors.
[01:07:09.582 --> 01:07:12.823]  The articles are on Infowars.com, The Hill, AP, you name it.
[01:07:12.823 --> 01:07:22.425]  To overthrow the president outside of impeachment, God, that's dangerous.
[01:07:22.425 --> 01:07:26.086]  And they say he's this incompetent loser.
[01:07:26.086 --> 01:07:29.887]  I shot an emergency report to the president today.
[01:07:29.887 --> 01:07:36.289]  The enemy, as Bill Maher has said, knows that I've sinked the president, and that is a fact.
[01:07:38.496 --> 01:07:43.441]  Not only because anybody that doesn't want to destroy the Republic and live in slavery is synced.
[01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:44.763]  But yeah, we're spiritually hooked up.
[01:07:44.763 --> 01:07:47.626]  That's what spirit is.
[01:07:47.626 --> 01:07:53.592]  So that's coming up.
[01:07:53.592 --> 01:07:54.533]  We've entered a new phase.
[01:08:00.407 --> 01:08:05.330]  I'm not worried about what happens to me, I'm worried about what happens to the continuum of humanity.
[01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:11.033]  And I'm bitching right up on air and I'm frustrated, but the crew's awesome, you're awesome, the listeners, the viewers.
[01:08:11.033 --> 01:08:14.454]  I'm just really ashamed that the Globalists are as bad as I thought they were.
[01:08:14.454 --> 01:08:20.678]  You know, I kind of hoped, I was kind of demonizing them 20 years ago, that they weren't as bad as I thought.
[01:08:20.678 --> 01:08:28.762]  But these are people that have turned themselves over to unlimited power grabbing because they don't have any power.
[01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:39.542]  And I kept hearing from Roger Stone and people that Trump wants to just try to turn things around and leave in four years.
[01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:40.204]  No one's ever done that.
[01:08:43.303 --> 01:08:51.632]  I talked to some honorable people in Congress, and I talked to some honorable folks in the campaign, and I talked to some others, and I finally had a chance to talk to somebody very close to Trump.
[01:08:51.632 --> 01:08:52.192]  Very close.
[01:08:52.192 --> 01:08:54.475]  About as close as you can get.
[01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:57.097]  And he said, wouldn't that be nice, Alex, if we could do that?
[01:08:57.097 --> 01:08:59.480]  He said, that would be nice.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.521]  I said, well, is that the case?
[01:09:00.521 --> 01:09:03.464]  He said, that'd be nice.
[01:09:03.464 --> 01:09:04.265]  That's what I'd like to do.
[01:09:05.946 --> 01:09:07.167]  That wasn't talk, man.
[01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:08.727]  That's classy.
[01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:13.989]  Because he's already got physical and spiritual power that he's not a piece of crap.
[01:09:13.989 --> 01:09:16.310]  And he wants to make people successful and get out of our way.
[01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:19.471]  And he doesn't care about the White House or any of that stuff.
[01:09:19.471 --> 01:09:26.074]  I just sat back and like... The realization that they wanted George Washington to be king.
[01:09:31.914 --> 01:09:33.295]  He served two terms and left.
[01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:34.495]  He didn't want to be it.
[01:09:34.495 --> 01:09:36.336]  And, well, I'm going to go to your phone calls now.
[01:09:36.336 --> 01:09:38.977]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:09:38.977 --> 01:09:48.902]  It's just that it's the classic story because they had this misquoted Media Matters article about Jones says he was offered $100 million a year to sell out.
[01:09:48.902 --> 01:09:56.466]  No, I said $10 million a year.
[01:09:56.466 --> 01:09:57.266]  It meant nothing.
[01:09:59.926 --> 01:10:10.914]  But I was explaining the story of how they tried to buy me off 18, 19 years ago, and then how they got so upset when I turned down the TV shows and all of it.
[01:10:10.914 --> 01:10:12.335]  It meant nothing to me.
[01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:18.119]  I was telling the story not to brag that I'd been offered, you know, 100 pounds of manure I could eat.
[01:10:19.608 --> 01:10:24.890]  I was explaining how it was crap, but they always want to make their crap gold.
[01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:30.652]  It's like they had this, quote, Fox News vice president, probably wasn't even a Fox, probably made up, Newark Daily News.
[01:10:30.652 --> 01:10:34.814]  You know, because even six, seven years ago, I still thought they might tell the truth some.
[01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.234]  I knew they were liars, but not that bad.
[01:10:36.234 --> 01:10:40.236]  They've been liars long before that.
[01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:44.037]  And I had turned down these three Fox TV shows because they were just total crap.
[01:10:44.037 --> 01:10:44.858]  And I didn't want to do that.
[01:10:51.634 --> 01:10:54.718]  Alex Jones wants to be Glenn Beck.
[01:10:54.718 --> 01:11:00.346]  And Alex Jones tried to get Fox shows, but he's not Fox worthy.
[01:11:02.984 --> 01:11:09.286]  And I sat back and I looked at that and it was just, I was like, oh my, that was an epiphany.
[01:11:09.286 --> 01:11:11.267]  They need us to worship that.
[01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:16.428]  They need us to think like Tinseltown, like it's the castle on the hill.
[01:11:16.428 --> 01:11:17.429]  It's Valhalla.
[01:11:17.429 --> 01:11:19.729]  It's the end of the Yellowbrook Road.
[01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:21.850]  It's, it's everything.
[01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:24.931]  And it's like, oh my, it's, there's nothing there.
[01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:26.812]  Your wife, your husband, your children.
[01:11:27.659 --> 01:11:29.723]  Going fishing, making dinner.
[01:11:29.723 --> 01:11:30.745]  That's human life.
[01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:31.607]  That's real.
[01:11:31.607 --> 01:11:36.476]  Not, I'll be somebody someday when I kiss the butt of the New World Order.
[01:11:47.346 --> 01:11:50.330]  Alright, I swear I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:51.371]  Let me see who I got here.
[01:11:51.371 --> 01:11:57.798]  We got Bradley and Jay and Samuel and Amber and Chase and Carlos and Mark and Mark and Mark.
[01:11:57.798 --> 01:11:58.719]  A bunch of Marks today.
[01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:00.241]  Can you guys move that thing down?
[01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:00.902]  I can't see the call.
[01:12:00.902 --> 01:12:02.624]  Sorry.
[01:12:02.624 --> 01:12:03.585]  Not that screen there.
[01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:06.508]  And we got Greg and I and a bunch of other people.
[01:12:06.508 --> 01:12:07.630]  Who should we go to yet?
[01:12:09.915 --> 01:12:12.998]  Greg says the globalists use cult-like tactics to get people into a trance.
[01:12:12.998 --> 01:12:14.138]  Well, that's true.
[01:12:14.138 --> 01:12:17.061]  God heard Clapper and Brennan say they will get Trump.
[01:12:17.061 --> 01:12:19.303]  Mark says that.
[01:12:19.303 --> 01:12:22.685]  Carlos says Jeff Session not addressing real issues.
[01:12:22.685 --> 01:12:27.349]  Chase says California alarmed the Purge movie prediction in the U.S.
[01:12:27.349 --> 01:12:30.532]  Oh, that's where the Army's KKK and they run around and kill black people.
[01:12:30.532 --> 01:12:33.394]  I mean, every show is white people killing black people.
[01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:34.555]  Oh, trying to start a race war?
[01:12:34.555 --> 01:12:35.175]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:12:35.175 --> 01:12:35.576]  We already know.
[01:12:36.761 --> 01:12:38.562]  It's not black people doing that, by the way.
[01:12:38.562 --> 01:12:44.344]  It's the media and all the liberals that, oh, oh, Starbucks has racial inclusion.
[01:12:44.344 --> 01:12:46.185]  You're a white guy, black guy, do you want to get a cup of coffee?
[01:12:46.185 --> 01:12:47.626]  You're like, you're not about race.
[01:12:47.626 --> 01:12:49.206]  You're like, what the hell is this?
[01:12:49.206 --> 01:12:53.208]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:59.811]  I know what's in their minds.
[01:12:59.811 --> 01:13:03.172]  I just can't believe that scum like this.
[01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:05.033]  God, I want to get along with everybody so bad.
[01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:15.343]  Oh, man, so hard.
[01:13:15.343 --> 01:13:21.707]  Let's go ahead and go to Mark in San Jose.
[01:13:21.707 --> 01:13:23.467]  San Jose, California.
[01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:27.429]  Where are you at, Mark?
[01:13:27.429 --> 01:13:30.051]  I'm in San Jose, California.
[01:13:30.051 --> 01:13:30.991]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:34.993]  You know, in regards to Clapper and Brennan, I would like to say
[01:13:36.522 --> 01:13:43.646]  The Lord Jesus Christ said, every idle word that men shall speak, they will give account thereof on judgment day.
[01:13:43.646 --> 01:13:51.089]  For by your words you'll be justified, and by your words you'll be condemned.
[01:13:51.089 --> 01:13:52.790]  Now, what did I mean by that?
[01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:54.951]  Um, I think it should be obvious.
[01:13:54.951 --> 01:14:04.416]  Now here these guys, Alex, come out and they say they're going to remove a sitting duly elected president and not by impeachment?
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.156]  It's outrageous criminal activity.
[01:14:08.824 --> 01:14:11.545]  Yeah, but listen, listen... Let me tell you something.
[01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:19.189]  If I said I was going to remove a federal judge in Austin, which I'm not, it's hypothetical, and I was coming after him, I should be investigated, probably arrested.
[01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:20.909]  I mean, if you follow the law.
[01:14:20.909 --> 01:14:21.470]  Exactly.
[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:22.830]  It's this lawlessness.
[01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:26.592]  Let's intimidate, let's get everybody, like, remember, like, let's go shoot, remember CNN?
[01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:27.873]  Well, another cop got killed.
[01:14:27.873 --> 01:14:28.973]  Well, cops deserve it.
[01:14:28.973 --> 01:14:31.454]  You know, they're, they need to do something for Black Lives Matter.
[01:14:31.454 --> 01:14:31.774]  What?
[01:14:31.774 --> 01:14:34.796]  Because a cop might have done something wrong in another state?
[01:14:34.796 --> 01:14:37.437]  You go shoot some cop pumping gas in Houston?
[01:14:38.177 --> 01:14:39.157]  Let me tell you something, man.
[01:14:39.157 --> 01:14:43.438]  I'm not in some cop worshipping fest, but I am pissed by crap like that.
[01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:46.139]  That's dangerous.
[01:14:46.139 --> 01:14:46.879]  Absolutely.
[01:14:46.879 --> 01:14:52.320]  And the reason why they call them San Jose's finest is because they are for the most part.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.801]  I actually had an incident today and they acted very, very professionally.
[01:14:56.801 --> 01:15:00.082]  But, you know, getting back to Clapper and Brennan,
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.981]  Listen, you boys, I want you to know something, okay?
[01:15:03.981 --> 01:15:06.241]  If Trump is taken out, you're dead meat.
[01:15:06.241 --> 01:15:07.681]  And you're dead meat the same day.
[01:15:07.681 --> 01:15:08.781]  You understand me?
[01:15:08.781 --> 01:15:11.822]  There's a God in heaven and he knows what you're doing and he's watching you.
[01:15:11.822 --> 01:15:13.762]  Okay?
[01:15:13.762 --> 01:15:15.843]  Let me be really sick here.
[01:15:15.843 --> 01:15:16.823]  I don't want Trump to die.
[01:15:16.823 --> 01:15:19.643]  I know Trump's real and a great guy.
[01:15:19.643 --> 01:15:21.384]  He's just not out to get America.
[01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.024]  He doesn't get why they hate America.
[01:15:23.024 --> 01:15:24.004]  That's why they call him dumb.
[01:15:24.004 --> 01:15:26.284]  He doesn't get their sick fantasy.
[01:15:26.284 --> 01:15:29.285]  But if they kill Trump,
[01:15:30.803 --> 01:15:40.588]  They just, they have, I totally agree with you that they have no, at a sick level, the best thing for us right now would be if they killed Trump.
[01:15:40.588 --> 01:15:43.429]  Do you understand the level of victory we'll have if they do it?
[01:15:43.429 --> 01:15:46.790]  And I think he may be understanding that.
[01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:51.472]  I think Trump is, leave it up to God, but Trump is prepared to die.
[01:15:51.472 --> 01:15:53.833]  I know him personally, people that know him, he's ready to die.
[01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:54.714]  So they understand that.
[01:15:56.508 --> 01:16:01.349]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:16.098]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:32.357]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:41.465]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:17:41.465 --> 01:17:46.370]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.

[01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:20.193]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs, if
[01:18:20.373 --> 01:18:20.934]  We're good to go.
[01:18:37.734 --> 01:18:39.476]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:39.476 --> 01:18:49.468]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.

[01:20:00.284 --> 01:20:11.933]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:14.555]  America is now in a civil war.
[01:20:25.589 --> 01:20:29.651]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:20:29.651 --> 01:20:31.232]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:35.134]  And that's what's so pathetic is people that serve the system aren't even part of it.
[01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:39.077]  God, free market, America, that is what's gonna give you a future.
[01:20:39.077 --> 01:20:44.039]  But they're delusional, they think if I go along with the system I get power.
[01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:48.542]  Okay, I'm gonna try to jam in as many calls as I can right now from Carlos to Chris to everybody.
[01:20:50.814 --> 01:20:52.695]  Mark in Oregon says he has a solution.
[01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:54.536]  Each caller gets about a minute because I've got to move fast.
[01:20:54.536 --> 01:20:55.816]  I want to hear from you all.
[01:20:55.816 --> 01:20:57.437]  So it's out of respect, not disrespect.
[01:20:57.437 --> 01:21:00.078]  Mark in Oregon, go ahead.
[01:21:00.078 --> 01:21:01.659]  Great to see you, Alex.
[01:21:01.659 --> 01:21:19.487]  Alex, what it amounts to at this point, I think, I don't see any ending to this as far as this treason and sedition goes from the top to the bottom whether you're talking about on college campuses all the way up to Obama himself, but more realistic, I think we could call the top of it
[01:21:20.067 --> 01:21:27.815]  Say, the ilk of Brennan, and the ones you've gone over today, Clapper, and forget his name, the TV host.
[01:21:27.815 --> 01:21:31.799]  No, I talked to high-level people today, and you know me, I'm anti-police state.
[01:21:31.799 --> 01:21:35.182]  They're trying to launch a police state and kill our election.
[01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:37.044]  Today I said, when does the military move?
[01:21:37.044 --> 01:21:42.009]  And the military is behind Trump right now, and it's being strongly considered right now.
[01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:44.711]  Yeah, I was going to mention that.
[01:21:44.711 --> 01:21:52.396]  I think it's most important that actually, as far as the power goes, it's many white hats against a few black hats, for all practices.
[01:21:52.396 --> 01:21:53.917]  Oh yeah, they'll fall very quickly.
[01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:56.618]  It's a bunch of corporate media, communist funded.
[01:21:56.618 --> 01:21:57.319]  God bless you.
[01:21:57.319 --> 01:21:58.019]  I see your comment.
[01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:02.342]  The solution to declare martial law or military tribunal.
[01:22:02.342 --> 01:22:02.782]  Here's the thing.
[01:22:02.782 --> 01:22:03.963]  We've been under martial law.
[01:22:03.963 --> 01:22:05.344]  Trump's trying to bring America back.
[01:22:06.184 --> 01:22:07.806]  There's a lot of optics to that.
[01:22:07.806 --> 01:22:10.468]  And I think Trump is tricking them into their moves.
[01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:13.852]  The problem is he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards.
[01:22:13.852 --> 01:22:17.355]  And I've been talking to folks that aren't cowards, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:22:17.355 --> 01:22:19.698]  And they understand exactly what's going on.
[01:22:19.698 --> 01:22:26.064]  And I'm just very honored to be basically the chaplain of this operation.
[01:22:26.064 --> 01:22:26.805]  I appreciate your call.
[01:22:28.331 --> 01:22:29.213]  And the enemy knows that.
[01:22:38.925 --> 01:22:43.008]  The prophet, like they said seven, eight years ago, Alex Jones, the prophet of the Tea Party.
[01:22:43.008 --> 01:22:43.889]  They see in archetypes.
[01:22:43.889 --> 01:22:49.274]  They see me as the prophet, and then Trump as the deliverer, like Moses.
[01:22:49.274 --> 01:22:53.818]  It's not a Christ figure, it's a Moses figure, and they want to get me and they want to get Trump.
[01:22:53.818 --> 01:22:56.500]  And let me tell you, I'm not on a power trip, folks.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.301]  I'm just telling you what they say.
[01:22:58.301 --> 01:23:00.523]  This is what goes on in the enemy's brain.
[01:23:00.523 --> 01:23:01.424]  And it's much bigger.
[01:23:01.424 --> 01:23:04.547]  You, all of you, are more important than I am.
[01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:06.989]  Because I want you to know, if they kill me or put me in prison, whatever they do,
[01:23:08.243 --> 01:23:12.484]  The idea goes on, but these globalists are Satanists.
[01:23:12.484 --> 01:23:16.746]  So, they believe power is in due to the individual, not in the spirit.
[01:23:16.746 --> 01:23:20.527]  They don't understand, like, we're all already... See, they claim they're collectivists.
[01:23:20.527 --> 01:23:20.967]  They're not.
[01:23:20.967 --> 01:23:24.688]  Like, the thing is, we're collectivists.
[01:23:24.688 --> 01:23:30.230]  I'm a total collectivist, but collectivism is individualism deciding on the collective for the greater good.
[01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:32.591]  It's not a collective over the individual.
[01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:33.651]  That's slavery.
[01:23:33.651 --> 01:23:36.672]  It's the collective is the individual deciding on the collective.
[01:23:37.819 --> 01:23:42.243]  And then sacrificing everything we are is built on that.
[01:23:42.243 --> 01:23:45.205]  And then they say they're collectivists when they're not collectivists.
[01:23:45.205 --> 01:23:47.647]  They are liars.
[01:23:47.647 --> 01:23:50.449]  Anyways, there's so many great callers here.
[01:23:50.449 --> 01:23:52.251]  Let's talk to Chase in California.
[01:23:52.251 --> 01:23:53.232]  You're on the air.
[01:23:53.232 --> 01:23:57.235]  I've seen the I've seen the descript of the purge and seen the trailer.
[01:23:57.235 --> 01:23:59.356]  They like the army wears KKK outfits.
[01:23:59.356 --> 01:24:01.218]  It goes and kills black people.
[01:24:01.218 --> 01:24:03.200]  What's your view on that?
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.841]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:04.841 --> 01:24:07.363]  This is Chase the Patriot front lines of California again.
[01:24:07.847 --> 01:24:12.010]  I'm doing that reporter challenge and I just filed a report actually on what you're talking about.
[01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:12.810]  Great.
[01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:16.272]  I tried to take a break and I tried to watch a little World Cup soccer.
[01:24:16.272 --> 01:24:18.413]  I don't watch a lot because I got a job actually.
[01:24:18.413 --> 01:24:18.814]  I understand.
[01:24:18.814 --> 01:24:22.776]  And the first ad I saw was this new movie called The Purge, right?
[01:24:22.776 --> 01:24:24.257]  It's the first Purge.
[01:24:24.257 --> 01:24:26.478]  So I started watching this ad and it's horrible.
[01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:27.299]  It's violence.
[01:24:27.299 --> 01:24:28.840]  It's racial violence.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.522]  It's the American flag getting desecrated and I'm just getting upset.
[01:24:32.952 --> 01:24:39.337]  So I start to kind of think about what's going on and their ad says, we need a new revolution on July 4th.
[01:24:39.337 --> 01:24:44.380]  And so when you go start thinking about what the purge, you know, in history, we know what the purge is.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:45.221]  That's Russia.
[01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:46.041]  That's communism.
[01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:46.882]  That's Stalin.
[01:24:46.882 --> 01:24:47.843]  That's millions of people.
[01:24:47.843 --> 01:24:50.144]  And they're claiming we're doing it.
[01:24:50.144 --> 01:24:53.147]  So the left must answer with a purge against us.
[01:24:53.147 --> 01:24:54.868]  They're trying to launch their purge July 4th.
[01:24:54.868 --> 01:24:56.569]  You're absolutely right.
[01:24:56.569 --> 01:24:57.650]  But here's the problem, Alex.
[01:24:58.171 --> 01:25:01.993]  See, before they can do something that bad, it's already been done before.
[01:25:01.993 --> 01:25:03.033]  So we have a memory of it.
[01:25:03.033 --> 01:25:06.975]  So what they're doing with an attack on language is they're trying to remove.
[01:25:06.975 --> 01:25:09.956]  If you go Google the Purge today, you won't learn about Russia.
[01:25:09.956 --> 01:25:12.097]  You're going to learn about these Hollywood movies.
[01:25:12.097 --> 01:25:14.618]  So once they eliminate the real reason why... No, you're right.
[01:25:14.618 --> 01:25:16.879]  Google is going through totally criminally.
[01:25:16.879 --> 01:25:19.079]  Google's a totally broken search engine now.
[01:25:19.079 --> 01:25:21.020]  And you're right, exactly.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.662]  It's like, on medical stuff, anything, it's all BS now.
[01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:27.383]  Google has always said, don't be evil because it's pure evil.
[01:25:27.383 --> 01:25:27.523]  Right?
[01:25:28.183 --> 01:25:29.283]  Point.
[01:25:29.283 --> 01:25:29.944]  Chase.
[01:25:29.944 --> 01:25:32.105]  Call me back tomorrow.
[01:25:32.105 --> 01:25:34.005]  Let's talk to Marco in North Carolina.
[01:25:34.005 --> 01:25:34.786]  Marco, you're on the air.
[01:25:34.786 --> 01:25:35.086]  Go ahead.
[01:25:35.086 --> 01:25:36.966]  Thanks.
[01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:38.747]  Hey, this is Marco Amaya.
[01:25:38.747 --> 01:25:40.648]  I'm in North Carolina.
[01:25:40.648 --> 01:25:42.088]  And can you hear me, Alex?
[01:25:42.088 --> 01:25:42.509]  I can.
[01:25:42.509 --> 01:25:44.069]  Go ahead.
[01:25:44.069 --> 01:25:50.892]  I'm a music producer and I produce patriotic music and I was just playing at a venue here in Mooresville, North Carolina.
[01:25:51.753 --> 01:26:02.077]  And they're usually used to listening to all the propaganda, sort of rap music that goes on, which controls people's minds, especially my age, 23 years old.
[01:26:02.077 --> 01:26:04.938]  So I started playing the Americana music in front of them.
[01:26:04.938 --> 01:26:10.621]  And a lot of them, it just sorted out the people, you know, the people that didn't understand it just had to walk out.
[01:26:10.621 --> 01:26:19.004]  And all the people that truly believed in this country and what is right, you know, they stayed there and they passionately, you know, gave me their energy and their love.
[01:26:19.004 --> 01:26:21.005]  But it really goes to show, you know, how
[01:26:21.733 --> 01:26:26.075]  How divided the country is in terms of psychologically through all the propaganda.
[01:26:26.075 --> 01:26:32.197]  Exactly, and they want to force all their minions to go out and confront those of us that see through it.
[01:26:32.197 --> 01:26:34.197]  This is desperate last gasp.
[01:26:34.197 --> 01:26:36.578]  I'm not going to sit here and say a bunch of positive stuff, just say it.
[01:26:36.578 --> 01:26:38.059]  We're in a real fight, but we're winning.
[01:26:39.338 --> 01:26:39.898]  Absolutely.
[01:26:39.898 --> 01:26:41.580]  That's why I'm going to keep moving forward.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:48.685]  I'm also going to apply to work with you at InfoWars at the Lifesound department because I truly believe in what you're doing.
[01:26:48.685 --> 01:26:49.866]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:49.866 --> 01:26:53.088]  Well, brother, we're trying to fund ourselves, so God bless you.
[01:26:53.088 --> 01:26:56.290]  The biggest thing people can do is we can hire people is buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:26:56.290 --> 01:26:57.511]  I barely even plug it.
[01:26:57.511 --> 01:26:58.632]  Great, amazing products.
[01:26:58.632 --> 01:27:00.533]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:27:00.533 --> 01:27:01.934]  50% off our fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:27:01.934 --> 01:27:03.295]  It's amazing with iodine.
[01:27:03.295 --> 01:27:04.436]  Coil silver fortified.
[01:27:04.436 --> 01:27:05.797]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:27:05.797 --> 01:27:06.738]  Let's talk to Carlos.
[01:27:07.558 --> 01:27:08.199]  In Canada.
[01:27:08.199 --> 01:27:09.601]  Carlos, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:27:09.601 --> 01:27:10.944]  Go ahead.
[01:27:10.944 --> 01:27:12.346]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:27:12.346 --> 01:27:17.414]  Just wanted to mention briefly that come October, there will maybe a surprise.
[01:27:18.207 --> 01:27:21.991]  You see, Bill Maher could not hold himself back.
[01:27:21.991 --> 01:27:25.494]  He's privy to information that mills around.
[01:27:25.494 --> 01:27:39.587]  And he probably has learned that in this October, a nice market crash and possibly a decline in the economy would be the precursor for the claims that President Trump has been misguided.
[01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:40.447]  I totally agree with you.
[01:27:40.447 --> 01:27:43.050]  They are planning a market crash to blame Trump in October.
[01:27:43.752 --> 01:27:54.722]  Yes, and the whole point I wanted to make to you was the fact that President Trump placed his trust in Senator Jeff Sessions.
[01:27:54.722 --> 01:28:01.248]  In 2005, I believe, he worked with Jeff Sessions on a Senate committee on the renovations to the United Nations.
[01:28:02.099 --> 01:28:02.179]  Okay.
[01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:22.755]  He knew very well that both political parties didn't want outsiders coming in and causing one party to overrule the other.
[01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:28.938]  They have a system whereby both political parties, you know, they take the country back and forth from each other.
[01:28:28.938 --> 01:28:32.681]  Come November, they would like to have the... No, he doesn't want a real revolution.
[01:28:32.681 --> 01:28:33.781]  You're right.
[01:28:33.781 --> 01:28:34.862]  So, I agree with you.
[01:28:34.862 --> 01:28:36.183]  They're planning to crash the U.S.
[01:28:36.183 --> 01:28:40.305]  economy and then sit there and say it's Trump's fault.
[01:28:40.305 --> 01:28:42.046]  So, let them try that.
[01:28:42.046 --> 01:28:43.847]  America is awakening.
[01:28:43.847 --> 01:28:44.628]  Alright, coming up...
[01:28:45.546 --> 01:28:46.387]  I'm gonna break it down.
[01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.470]  The Democrats are saying remove Trump.
[01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:51.134]  The 25th Amendment, they're moving right now to do it.
[01:28:51.134 --> 01:28:52.556]  This is happening now.
[01:28:52.556 --> 01:28:54.279]  Take this serious or they'll win.
[01:28:54.279 --> 01:28:54.720]  We'll be back.

[01:32:59.839 --> 01:33:02.438]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:44.095]  Everyone who has an IQ above room temperature or has any spiritual connection to reality knows that the world is in a state of incredible change or flux as it's called and that we've passed a point of no return a demarcation line a event horizon a
[01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:53.421]  We came to the crossroads, and humanity made the right decision.
[01:33:53.421 --> 01:33:58.884]  We decided against austerity, and eugenics, and technocracy, and robot control.
[01:33:58.884 --> 01:34:15.374]  The globalists may have decided for it, but humans, from the continent of Africa, to the continent of South America, to the continent of Asia, to the continent of North America, to Russia, to Europe, in every election, and in every vote, both economically and
[01:34:16.735 --> 01:34:24.819]  Culturally are saying no to the globalist plan.
[01:34:24.819 --> 01:34:27.240]  And so we came to the crossroads.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:33.503]  As I said, we had come to them about five years ago.
[01:34:33.503 --> 01:34:39.706]  And we made the right turn on the road towards God, towards justice, towards the future.
[01:34:41.152 --> 01:34:42.213]  It wasn't about being liberal.
[01:34:42.213 --> 01:34:43.414]  It wasn't about being conservative.
[01:34:43.414 --> 01:34:44.616]  It wasn't about being straight.
[01:34:44.616 --> 01:34:45.637]  It wasn't about being gay.
[01:34:45.637 --> 01:34:47.118]  It wasn't about being a man or a woman.
[01:34:47.118 --> 01:34:51.883]  It wasn't about being brown or pink or having a beard or not having a beard.
[01:34:51.883 --> 01:35:00.332]  It was about what was in our heart and goodwill versus badwill.
[01:35:00.332 --> 01:35:02.575]  The global social engineer's greatest power
[01:35:05.544 --> 01:35:26.515]  Has been that they've been over the top and so outrageously evil that the average person who's not like that, who has a conscience, who has just a sense of human connectivity, or what the liberals try to claim they have, but we just really haven't, a sense of community.
[01:35:26.515 --> 01:35:32.919]  They have gone so far towards trying to drum the humanity out of us.
[01:35:34.565 --> 01:35:45.672]  But they pushed us all the way back to the other side in a full circle, and humanity came back just like that.
[01:35:45.672 --> 01:35:54.477]  The President needs spiritual support.
[01:35:54.477 --> 01:36:00.361]  The President needs to know that we understand the big choices that have been made.
[01:36:00.361 --> 01:36:03.343]  Because as we go down this path,
[01:36:05.001 --> 01:36:17.547]  As we begin to pick up steam for human development and human longevity and human productivity and human expansion and all that comes with it, what we've done so far, it's unbelievable.
[01:36:17.547 --> 01:36:21.069]  Well, this is just baby steps.
[01:36:21.069 --> 01:36:29.373]  This is a one-year-old taking their first few hesitant steps into the future.
[01:36:30.657 --> 01:36:33.438]  But that outrages the Satanists.
[01:36:33.438 --> 01:36:40.901]  That outrages the control freaks because if you develop, you're not going to need them anymore.
[01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:46.543]  You've got to be stunted and arrested so they can rule you.
[01:36:46.543 --> 01:36:55.286]  Because by their very definition, the social engineers are stunted.
[01:36:55.286 --> 01:36:58.247]  Because they were engineering planetary rule.
[01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:04.432]  Because only slaves can be ruled.
[01:37:04.432 --> 01:37:08.434]  They were engineering slaves.
[01:37:08.434 --> 01:37:12.236]  I'm not engineering anything.
[01:37:12.236 --> 01:37:16.018]  I'm blowing holes in the cage.
[01:37:16.018 --> 01:37:21.361]  And I believe in you, and I believe you're gonna come out.
[01:37:21.361 --> 01:37:24.103]  And I can't believe how ineffectual and pathetic they are.
[01:37:25.526 --> 01:37:27.107]  They think they're attached to anything to me?
[01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:37.516]  I mean, I've already blown, with your help, so many holes in their operation, that I'm just here with actually super positive, super upbeat, super excited.
[01:37:37.516 --> 01:37:47.044]  Because I know God's in control, and not these child molesters and devil worshippers, who think they set the confines of the world, they define reality.
[01:37:47.044 --> 01:37:51.468]  No, you don't.
[01:37:51.468 --> 01:37:52.149]  So that said,
[01:37:56.468 --> 01:38:08.941]  Humanity has begun its walk down the right road, but the crossroads is only like 20 feet behind us, and standing back there, calling our name is the siren song.
[01:38:08.941 --> 01:38:09.762]  Come back!
[01:38:09.762 --> 01:38:10.763]  You're failing!
[01:38:10.763 --> 01:38:12.164]  You're losing!
[01:38:12.164 --> 01:38:13.065]  It's not good!
[01:38:13.065 --> 01:38:14.166]  You're gonna die!
[01:38:14.166 --> 01:38:17.490]  We don't want to have to have a depression to get you back in line!
[01:38:19.428 --> 01:38:24.731]  We're gonna have nuclear war as we see peace, as we see the economy come back.
[01:38:24.731 --> 01:38:26.591]  And we're like, well, that's not what's happening.
[01:38:26.591 --> 01:38:30.473]  And things look so much better off in the future if we just follow God's plan.
[01:38:30.473 --> 01:38:33.595]  But no, no, come back, come back.
[01:38:33.595 --> 01:38:36.256]  We're going to get you if you don't.
[01:38:36.256 --> 01:38:40.818]  Don't, don't, don't listen to that.
[01:38:40.818 --> 01:38:42.399]  And it's all a giant con.
[01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:48.848]  Of slave masters, and they're slaves, and they're all slaves.
[01:38:48.848 --> 01:38:51.710]  The slave master is more of a slave than a slave.
[01:38:51.710 --> 01:39:01.217]  Trying to control the universe, trying to control an explosion of consciousness.
[01:39:01.217 --> 01:39:12.846]  When you can't control an explosion of consciousness, all you can do is meet it, commune with it, and dream with it, and then hope to have a future with it.
[01:39:14.124 --> 01:39:23.553]  Because destiny like that, like the double helix of DNA, is an intertwining, it is a merger, it is a synthesis, it is not control.
[01:39:23.553 --> 01:39:27.777]  It's turning loose.
[01:39:27.777 --> 01:39:33.843]  The system tells you to turn loose all day, but they mean turn loose of your destiny to go with turning it loose.
[01:39:35.051 --> 01:39:36.811]  They're the ones that can't turn it loose.
[01:39:36.811 --> 01:39:41.472]  The average globalist is the most neurotic, pathetic, unhappy person in the world.
[01:39:41.472 --> 01:39:42.932]  They could have a billion dollars.
[01:39:42.932 --> 01:39:44.073]  They could have 10 billion.
[01:39:44.073 --> 01:39:50.834]  These people are enslaved by their worship of the world.
[01:39:50.834 --> 01:39:55.535]  They're empty.
[01:39:55.535 --> 01:40:01.836]  And so we have begun down this better road, but you have to understand there are other crossroads ahead.
[01:40:05.732 --> 01:40:14.316]  And we look at this time we're living in and think of it as some great challenge.
[01:40:14.316 --> 01:40:17.597]  This is going to be looked back on as a cakewalk.
[01:40:17.597 --> 01:40:26.501]  This is going to be looked back on as one of the easiest, happiest times we've ever seen in our existence as a species.
[01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:33.104]  And we're going to go, oh my God, this was the dinging between the bell and the next big round.
[01:40:34.241 --> 01:40:37.582]  We thought this was hard because we weren't conscious.
[01:40:37.582 --> 01:40:46.304]  We were sitting on the bench drinking some water, we're putting some Vaseline on our face, our heads ringing.
[01:40:46.304 --> 01:40:57.186]  If you think this calm before the next storm is a challenge, I feel sorry for you.
[01:40:58.809 --> 01:41:06.031]  This is a baby step, a beta test for what's going to win for us in the future.
[01:41:06.031 --> 01:41:08.872]  Because not everybody's gonna make it.
[01:41:08.872 --> 01:41:10.292]  And I mean your children.
[01:41:10.292 --> 01:41:12.733]  None of you will make it.
[01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:18.754]  Some of you watching right now, some of your grandchildren are going to make it to the next level of human development.
[01:41:18.754 --> 01:41:20.075]  I know it as a fact.
[01:41:20.075 --> 01:41:24.076]  I've already seen it.
[01:41:24.076 --> 01:41:28.437]  But I have a lot of sorrow
[01:41:31.365 --> 01:41:39.929]  For those of you that are serving the system, because you're going to be so betrayed by the system, you're not going to know what to do.
[01:41:39.929 --> 01:41:48.814]  But I have even more pain for people that believe in God, but believe the churches, that there's not going to ever be legitimate suffering.
[01:41:48.814 --> 01:41:51.095]  And so you're going to think you've been betrayed by God.
[01:41:51.095 --> 01:41:52.996]  You're going to think you're living through the tribulation.
[01:41:54.397 --> 01:42:02.401]  When you're only living in a simulation of the true tribulation to come, because God doesn't ever put anything in front of us we're not ready for.
[01:42:02.401 --> 01:42:09.584]  You're in training camp, you're in two-a-days, and you're like a fifth grader in Little League, in Pop Warner.
[01:42:09.584 --> 01:42:10.625]  You're not in the NFL.
[01:42:17.315 --> 01:42:34.471]  And I look at these soulless, worldly people that think they're controlling this dimension, and they think they have power, and it really makes me sad for them because they don't have any idea what leadership is, they don't have any idea what the human species is, they have no connection to their genetics, they have no connection to the bigger plan.
[01:42:34.471 --> 01:42:37.013]  When we come back, I'm gonna get more into the bigger plan.
[01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:44.602]  And I'm gonna look at possible futures that even the establishment admits are probable.
[01:42:44.602 --> 01:42:48.704]  Versus us taking control of our destiny, which is the true human trait.
[01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:49.385]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:49.385 --> 01:42:52.967]  Stay with us.
[01:42:56.348 --> 01:43:00.312]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:43:00.312 --> 01:43:03.594]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:43:03.594 --> 01:43:09.860]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.643]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:43:13.363 --> 01:43:17.206]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:43:17.206 --> 01:43:23.672]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:43:23.672 --> 01:43:28.636]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:33.291]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:40.494]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:43:40.494 --> 01:43:45.196]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:43:45.196 --> 01:43:51.419]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:43:51.419 --> 01:43:55.381]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:43:56.425 --> 01:44:05.916]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:44:05.916 --> 01:44:10.622]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:44:10.622 --> 01:44:15.027]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:44:15.387 --> 01:44:18.429]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:44:18.429 --> 01:44:20.870]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:24.412]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:44:24.412 --> 01:44:28.314]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:44:28.314 --> 01:44:37.360]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.060]  Read the facts.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:38.621]  We're good.
[01:44:57.048 --> 01:45:00.652]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:00.652 --> 01:45:02.434]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:02.434 --> 01:45:13.705]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:14.466 --> 01:45:23.653]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:23.653 --> 01:45:29.417]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:45:29.417 --> 01:45:34.720]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:37.342]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:37.342 --> 01:45:39.063]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:39.063 --> 01:45:43.867]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:45:44.087 --> 01:45:49.030]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:51.691]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:51.691 --> 01:45:56.394]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[01:47:00.819 --> 01:47:03.462]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.745 --> 01:47:34.991]  And it's the final segment of the broadcast tonight, and I've already covered this some, but I think I should really go back and look at this again, because we saw the American people elect Donald John Trump over a year and a half ago, almost two years ago.
[01:47:34.991 --> 01:47:37.052]  It was back in November of 2016.
[01:47:37.052 --> 01:47:44.116]  And then we saw Brendan and Clapper and Mudd and all of them go on TV.
[01:47:45.401 --> 01:47:51.944]  With their paid gigs at CNN and MSNBC and say that Trump would soon be overthrown.
[01:47:51.944 --> 01:47:52.824]  That Trump was a traitor.
[01:47:52.824 --> 01:47:59.047]  Phil Mudd said the deep state's gonna kill this guy.
[01:47:59.047 --> 01:48:06.790]  And so now we see the economy coming back, Americana coming back, our military being rebuilt, our borders being secured, thousands of companies coming back.
[01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:14.834]  And then these very same people go on CNN, MSNBC, all the usual channels and say we want a depression to stop Trump.
[01:48:16.601 --> 01:48:35.212]  And they go on, and they say, we want to bully not just the head of Homeland Security when she's out at dinner, but we want to kick Sanders, the press secretary out of the Communist hen restaurant.
[01:48:35.212 --> 01:48:37.173]  They're in DC.
[01:48:37.173 --> 01:48:39.554]  They're in Virginia, outside DC.
[01:48:39.554 --> 01:48:43.477]  And we want to go out and confront all of them because they're Nazis.
[01:48:43.477 --> 01:48:45.358]  Because a week and a half ago, the former head of the CIA,
[01:48:48.399 --> 01:48:50.661]  Said so.
[01:48:50.661 --> 01:49:01.511]  So you've got Brennan saying, overthrow the Trump administration, have the cabinet turn against the president, and implement the 25th Amendment.
[01:49:01.511 --> 01:49:13.062]  And then you've got the former CIA head as well, who was involved in all the illegal spying, former head of the NSA, you name it, coming out and saying, again a week and a half ago,
[01:49:17.332 --> 01:49:26.740]  That the president is a Nazi and that stopping families at the border and unaccompanied children is like Dachau, Auschwitz, or Buchenwald.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:28.161]  That's a tweet!
[01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:29.543]  And then he defended it all over the news!
[01:49:31.522 --> 01:49:42.727]  So, you've got all these individuals running around like mad dogs using tactics that have been used to overthrow third world countries and enemies of the U.S.
[01:49:42.727 --> 01:49:44.988]  But now these are the enemies of the U.S.
[01:49:44.988 --> 01:49:50.710]  on the Communist Chinese payroll, the corporate payroll, the EU payroll, the Microsoft payroll, the Google payroll.
[01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:53.891]  That's who they are.
[01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:58.633]  And they're telling you that you're a bad person and that we're going to go after you now.
[01:49:58.633 --> 01:49:59.754]  So that's a talking point.
[01:50:00.979 --> 01:50:15.896]  From all these former CIA heads, NSA heads, Donnie Deutsch on MSNBC, CNN, that go out and get in the face of Trump supporters, make them submit to you because they're Nazis, because CNN
[01:50:19.707 --> 01:50:21.227]  Don't forget this.
[01:50:21.227 --> 01:50:30.550]  Put out the fake photo with the fake video with other children dubbed over crying, saying the little girl was separated from her mother when the mother and the father and everybody went public and said no.
[01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:32.891]  She's been deported before 2013.
[01:50:32.891 --> 01:50:33.611]  She came back.
[01:50:33.611 --> 01:50:36.311]  She was put in an immigrant family center.
[01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:45.954]  It's only when they can't tell who's who, and most of these kids, 83%, we now learn are unaccompanied by parents, that you then get put in a separate area because you're not going to put kids in general population.
[01:50:45.954 --> 01:50:47.695]  It's all a hoax.
[01:50:47.695 --> 01:50:48.635]  And then Tom Arnold.
[01:50:49.594 --> 01:51:02.320]  Who was obnoxious and a joke and an empty vessel, a flesh bag, a blood bag, when he was around decades ago, I couldn't stand him.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:08.584]  And then he goes on television Friday, and I didn't even really counter it, but I said it's a total hoax for his Vice TV show.
[01:51:08.584 --> 01:51:10.024]  I just said it's a total lie.
[01:51:10.024 --> 01:51:16.628]  Why would somebody's lawyer meet him in a hotel where Arnold was staked out with Vice for days?
[01:51:17.884 --> 01:51:19.806]  Knowing where Cohen was staying.
[01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:21.887]  Cohen comes out, poses for a selfie.
[01:51:21.887 --> 01:51:23.949]  Even local news said, no, we were there.
[01:51:23.949 --> 01:51:25.490]  He talked 20 seconds, nothing happened.
[01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:26.951]  He goes on TV and says, it's all true.
[01:51:26.951 --> 01:51:27.832]  Trump's corrupt.
[01:51:27.832 --> 01:51:29.834]  Trump's going down.
[01:51:29.834 --> 01:51:31.255]  And then she and others defend it.
[01:51:31.255 --> 01:51:32.976]  Well, Arnold's just an entertainer.
[01:51:32.976 --> 01:51:36.139]  He's just having fun.
[01:51:36.139 --> 01:51:41.363]  That's what they hide behind in Hollywood.
[01:51:41.363 --> 01:51:42.364]  Like when Joe Rogan, my
[01:51:43.587 --> 01:51:46.189]  I mean, this is just total mental patient behavior from Tom Arnold.
[01:52:02.442 --> 01:52:04.823]  But I saw articles in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:52:04.823 --> 01:52:06.424]  I saw them in the States from this morning.
[01:52:06.424 --> 01:52:08.405]  I was checking to see what government propaganda was saying.
[01:52:08.405 --> 01:52:10.426]  It was like, Tom Arnold's funny.
[01:52:10.426 --> 01:52:12.026]  Tom Arnold plays a joke.
[01:52:12.026 --> 01:52:15.027]  Tom Arnold, you know, ha ha ha, he's an actor.
[01:52:15.027 --> 01:52:20.750]  And it's no, he got up on television and lied about what Trump's lawyer said.
[01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:26.972]  When those that have actually gotten all of his seized stuff say there's nothing there, that's a whole crime that they seize somebody's lawyer's personal stuff.
[01:52:26.972 --> 01:52:28.773]  Cuz it's not about Russiagate, it's about everything else now.
[01:52:33.402 --> 01:52:37.405]  So they lie about a little girl at the border, being separated from parents.
[01:52:37.405 --> 01:52:40.128]  They lie about the Tom Arnold stuff.
[01:52:40.128 --> 01:52:41.749]  And then we wonder why they lie, they lie, they lie.
[01:52:41.749 --> 01:52:42.890]  And you go, why do they lie so much?
[01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:45.732]  Because they already got caught lying.
[01:52:45.732 --> 01:52:50.777]  So they have nothing to lose.
[01:52:50.777 --> 01:52:59.964]  Even USA Today admitted on Friday, okay, okay, it's not true.
[01:52:59.964 --> 01:53:00.385]  But I
[01:53:02.008 --> 01:53:05.069]  This morning was getting gas.
[01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:07.230]  And people say three things to me, and it's a minority of folks.
[01:53:07.230 --> 01:53:16.774]  I shook 400 hands in Hawaii, 300, 400 hands, three women came up, got in my face and said that I was a Russian spy and all this other crap.
[01:53:16.774 --> 01:53:19.135]  But they say three things.
[01:53:19.135 --> 01:53:20.616]  And today I'm sitting there getting gas.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:34.593]  Like 11, when I'm going to a business meeting, an intel meeting, and they go, you and your Russian boss are going down and F you for what you've done to those children.
[01:53:34.593 --> 01:53:35.934]  And I said, it's always the same.
[01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:36.916]  I go, what did I do?
[01:53:36.916 --> 01:53:38.938]  And the woman's like, two things over.
[01:53:38.938 --> 01:53:40.159]  Yeah, she goes, F you!
[01:53:41.425 --> 01:53:42.566]  There's no intellect.
[01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:43.987]  It's like I'm television.
[01:53:43.987 --> 01:53:47.431]  It's like she saw a Pokemon she was trying to capture or something.
[01:53:47.431 --> 01:53:48.492]  It's like I'm not real.
[01:53:48.492 --> 01:53:49.513]  She just is.
[01:53:49.513 --> 01:53:50.854]  I did something to children.
[01:53:50.854 --> 01:53:52.776]  I collapsed Latin America.
[01:53:52.776 --> 01:53:56.760]  I was a woman through the desert with a small child who should get arrested for doing it.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.561]  Anybody should.
[01:53:57.561 --> 01:53:58.842]  And I did something.
[01:53:58.842 --> 01:53:59.522]  I'm the bad man.
[01:54:00.123 --> 01:54:01.945]  And it's just that feeling good, see?
[01:54:01.945 --> 01:54:03.287]  It's a simulation.
[01:54:03.287 --> 01:54:04.869]  It's not about being real.
[01:54:04.869 --> 01:54:07.772]  It's not about actually standing for something or changing the world.
[01:54:07.772 --> 01:54:12.919]  It's about pointing your finger at somebody and feeling good.
[01:54:12.919 --> 01:54:18.005]  How many live feeds have you seen where I'm out on the street in Austin or wherever and people go, F you, you Russian?
[01:54:19.855 --> 01:54:24.758]  And I'm the most pro-gun, pro-private property, pro-America guy around.
[01:54:24.758 --> 01:54:26.058]  Everybody knows that.
[01:54:26.058 --> 01:54:33.042]  And here are these leftists that hate America and hate flyover country and love Russia when it was run by communists and love China today.
[01:54:33.042 --> 01:54:36.984]  And then they point at the real thing.
[01:54:36.984 --> 01:54:41.286]  I don't say I'm the real thing like, you know, I'm at the end of a pot of gold here like a rainbow.
[01:54:41.286 --> 01:54:43.127]  I'm just saying, I mean, I stand for what I stand.
[01:54:44.548 --> 01:54:53.197]  Globalists think I'm mentally ill and Trump's mentally ill because we don't see the greater picture of world government and how dumb the public is and the greater cause of our power.
[01:54:53.197 --> 01:54:54.058]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:54.058 --> 01:54:55.699]  I don't want to screw everybody over.
[01:54:55.699 --> 01:54:56.020]  Exactly.
[01:54:56.852 --> 01:55:01.255]  But you can point at one of the minions of the system who isn't even part of it.
[01:55:01.255 --> 01:55:03.356]  That woman never got invited to the Kissinger Group.
[01:55:03.356 --> 01:55:06.238]  That woman never got offered $10 million a year to sell out.
[01:55:06.238 --> 01:55:08.960]  That woman was never offered three Fox News television shows.
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:11.442]  That woman wasn't offered starring roles in major movies.
[01:55:11.442 --> 01:55:20.608]  That woman just sits there at the gas station and points at me like she's this superior person when I bet you all the tea in China.
[01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:28.082]  She'd sell her whole family out to be on some stupid reality TV show.
[01:55:28.082 --> 01:55:29.707]  You know damn well she would.
[01:55:30.666 --> 01:55:36.892]  You can put a gun to my head and I wouldn't F anybody over cuz I've got my integrity.
[01:55:36.892 --> 01:55:46.660]  And I'm sick of these people that have no integrity and no soul pointing at me and telling me, can we queue up to close out the broadcast?
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:47.781]  If not, it's okay.
[01:55:47.781 --> 01:55:53.066]  That clip I wanted to play, it's Maxine Waters at a rally saying, he's a traitor.
[01:55:53.066 --> 01:55:56.268]  Americans are awake to it and Trump's being
[01:55:57.245 --> 01:56:02.148]  Mean, and people are booing his secretaries!
[01:56:02.148 --> 01:56:06.451]  Oh my God, our forefathers fought Hitler and got killed, but we gotta get booed.
[01:56:06.451 --> 01:56:08.072]  We're so scared, Maxine Waters.
[01:56:08.072 --> 01:56:12.495]  We have a... It's alright.
[01:56:12.495 --> 01:56:15.257]  The point is, the video's on Infowars.com.
[01:56:15.257 --> 01:56:17.439]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:17.439 --> 01:56:21.041]  And it's just the mindset and the way they operate.
[01:56:21.041 --> 01:56:22.662]  Yeah, there's the article.
[01:56:22.662 --> 01:56:24.263]  And just how stupid it is.
[01:56:24.263 --> 01:56:26.465]  Then you wonder, how are people buying into this show?
[01:56:27.285 --> 01:56:35.312]  You've got a bunch of discredited former CIA directors and people that think they run the government saying they're about to remove Trump and threatening his cabinet.
[01:56:35.312 --> 01:56:45.781]  You've got all these people trying to go around and harass and terrorize and make up lies when Trump has fixed Obama's issues with the border that he triggered by saying, come up here.
[01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:50.425]  And then even when Trump says, fine, we'll try to not separate the few percentage of kids that do get separated.
[01:56:50.425 --> 01:56:55.329]  And they double down and say, no, we want totally open borders, which is world government at the end of the country.
[01:56:57.768 --> 01:57:02.150]  So, it's totally clear what's going on, and so it's a choice.
[01:57:02.150 --> 01:57:04.291]  Are you an idiot of these people, or do you want a future?
[01:57:04.291 --> 01:57:14.196]  It's not that me and Trump are perfect, it's that we're pro-human, we want a pro-human future, and we've gone over that crossroads, and the system's calling back saying, hey, are you sure you don't want to come back here?
[01:57:14.196 --> 01:57:16.157]  And I'm like, no, I'm not turning into a pillar of salt.
[01:57:16.157 --> 01:57:18.178]  I'm moving on to the promised land.
[01:57:18.178 --> 01:57:22.980]  It's a long haul, it's not a utopia, but we don't want to be under your control anymore.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:23.661]  It's that simple.
[01:57:25.011 --> 01:57:29.137]  And that's why I'm very, very thankful for all of you and why I appreciate you all because this is history.
[01:57:29.137 --> 01:57:33.904]  And the fact that we're just together talking, the fact that we're here aware of all this, that's the real issue.
[01:57:33.904 --> 01:57:36.388]  They say the journey is the destination.
[01:57:36.388 --> 01:57:38.150]  We're all here together learning the truth together.
[01:57:38.150 --> 01:57:38.952]  That's what's beautiful.
[01:57:50.234 --> 01:57:55.959]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:57:55.959 --> 01:58:03.845]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:58:03.845 --> 01:58:07.008]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:58:07.188 --> 01:58:12.450]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:15.231]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:58:15.231 --> 01:58:24.215]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:58:24.275 --> 01:58:29.136]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:58:54.708 --> 01:58:58.490]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:58:58.490 --> 01:59:07.194]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:59:07.194 --> 01:59:11.796]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:59:11.796 --> 01:59:13.256]  You are the info war.
[01:59:13.256 --> 01:59:16.778]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:59:17.458 --> 01:59:28.843]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:59:28.843 --> 01:59:36.807]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:36.807 --> 01:59:43.851]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:43.851 --> 01:59:46.612]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[01:59:50.302 --> 01:59:52.917]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
