[00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:08.591]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:14.239]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.693]  17 years ago, jetliners crashed into the World Trade Center towers 1 and 2.
[00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:43.156]  Building 7, later that day, was destroyed in a controlled demolition.
[00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:46.038]  We were there, live on air, covering it.
[00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.903]  What an incredible time in history as we remember all those poor souls that died and the great heroes that tried to save so many.
[00:00:55.103 --> 00:00:56.644]  They rushed in when others rushed out.
[00:00:58.365 --> 00:00:59.746]  We should honor them today, and we will be.
[00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:02.833]  And of course, history.
[00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:10.897]  Happening now, the stars aligning, only 56 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.237]  I've been saying that for over a year.
[00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:17.820]  Now you see Obama saying it, Hillary saying it, the Globalists saying it, because it's a referendum on their world government.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.641]  And a referendum on internet censorship.
[00:01:21.262 --> 00:01:22.462]  And incredible crackdowns.
[00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:25.183]  And Amazon now banning hundreds of books.
[00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:30.226]  That's right, we've got an article on Infowars.com, it's on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:43.158]  We're a popular dating guide book that tells guys to be cocky and alpha male, which is how you do get the most women, if that's what you're looking for.
[00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:46.777]  The problem will then be getting rid of them.
[00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:48.798]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:58.104]  But it teaches guys that have been shut-ins their whole lives how to be more confident and just basic mammal mating tactics.
[00:01:58.564 --> 00:01:59.945]  Nine of his books are banned in one day.
[00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:05.849]  But it's a bunch of other conservatives and nationalists and people criticizing Islam, they're all being banned as well.
[00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.211]  It's just that they're not getting any attention when it happens.
[00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:10.375]  It's on.
[00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:11.316]  And of course his crime?
[00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:13.877]  Well, his book was going towards number one.
[00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:14.418]  His new book.
[00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:15.719]  The first day it went on sale.
[00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.243]  So Paul Watson will interview that gentleman coming up today in the fourth hour.
[00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:25.885]  So look for that at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:27.166]  Now the really big news.
[00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:30.708]  We've got the anniversary of 9-11.
[00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:34.630]  We've got Iranian sleeper cells threatening to launch new attacks in the U.S.
[00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.871]  and that's a real terror group.
[00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:37.172]  We've got
[00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.361]  Looming war with Syria and U.S.
[00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:44.543]  bombardments that are going on and not even getting any attention.
[00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:46.564]  We've got 56 days out from the election.
[00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:47.845]  All the intensifying censorship.
[00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.827]  But what's the big enchilada?
[00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:56.272]  Well, the Department of Energy and the nuclear regulatory agencies have come out.
[00:02:56.312 --> 00:02:58.314]  We have a detailed report coming out at noon.
[00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:01.917]  And Mike Adams, the engineer, will be joining us with maps and more.
[00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:06.261]  Hurricane Florence could threaten 10 nuclear power facilities.
[00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:11.448]  And we know that we have some of the most aging nuclear plants in the world.
[00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.491]  There are 467 nuclear power plants.
[00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:19.233]  There are several hundred other experimental plants, two of which are in Austin.
[00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:21.975]  And many of them are old and rotting.
[00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:34.224]  And so this is a Category 6 hurricane, estimated when it makes landfall, when it slams into South and North Carolina, is its attack vector at this point.
[00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:38.626]  You're seeing a massive exodus out of that area, obviously, ahead of the storm.
[00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.828]  We'll be going over all of this here on the broadcast today.
[00:03:43.908 --> 00:03:49.931]  Big focus on the hurricane with expert analysis in the second hour.
[00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:57.234]  And then, I've heard his show many times, just went on a few weeks ago and I was amazed by Clyde Lewis.
[00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:07.678]  Because I used to go to bed pretty late, but then when you end up having four children, you end up going to bed earlier and earlier.
[00:04:07.738 --> 00:04:11.199]  So I go to bed a lot of times about nine o'clock, so I haven't listened to his show in quite a while.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:23.444]  But I tuned into it when I was on, obviously, and it was just amazing, his knowledge of the deep state, the martial law plan, and things I'd forgotten about that blew me away.
[00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:27.786]  The internet kill switch, stay-behind groups Obama put in place.
[00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:34.750]  And I was remembering as he said it, and I was sitting there search-engineering at my computer in the kitchen when I was on for three hours the other night.
[00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:36.832]  And I was like, you've got to come on my show.
[00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:38.453]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:40.414]  So this is really important intel.
[00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:43.596]  The reason they banned the show is that we're exposing the whole Deep State situation.
[00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:45.357]  That's coming up the third hour.
[00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.498]  Paul Watson has the guy who had his books banned.
[00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:51.901]  And Amazon got contacted by the media, and they said, yeah, we banned his books.
[00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:53.182]  So what are you gonna do about it?
[00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:54.043]  Well, I can tell you why.
[00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:55.184]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:57.466]  Cause it's, it's, they don't want men and women mating.
[00:04:57.806 --> 00:04:58.867]  They don't want us coming together.
[00:04:58.907 --> 00:04:59.888]  They want us divided.
[00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.271]  And it's all about targeting our reproductive systems.
[00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:11.691]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:12.992]  And I want to thank you all.
[00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:14.033]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[00:05:14.053 --> 00:05:15.835]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:22.180]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.542]  And we've got products that help you.
[00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:27.525]  I mean, even mainstream media admits, they have to, that fish roe is the best thing ever.
[00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:28.946]  But you want pure fish oil.
[00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:30.427]  You want the mercury removed.
[00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:32.809]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:33.730]  The best krill oil.
[00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.452]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[00:05:36.492 --> 00:05:39.955]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[00:05:40.395 --> 00:05:40.896]  The Honor Roll.
[00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:41.536]  Three different types.
[00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:42.497]  You cannot do better.
[00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:43.358]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:05:43.398 --> 00:05:43.938]  Help the brain.
[00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:44.439]  Help the body.
[00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.899]  Help the heart.
[00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:45.499]  Help the InfoWar.
[00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.220]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.082]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:18.243]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:34.296]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:47.119]  56 days out, ladies and gentlemen, the most important election in world history.
[00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:56.863]  We've got 10 nuclear power plants that the Department of Energy admits are in the path of a Category 6 hurricane.
[00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:02.626]  Hurricane Florence, we're praying that it slows down.
[00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:08.889]  But if it hits as a Category 6, you're talking spectacular devastation.
[00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.330]  Could it be an American Fukushima?
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:20.967]  We've already had multiple nukes blow up in the United States before, one back in the 50s in California, and no one even knew to the 80s when it was declassified.
[00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:23.669]  It was as bad as Fukushima.
[00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:30.695]  And the plants are on average 40 years old and rotting.
[00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:32.337]  92% of worldwide plants are leaking.
[00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:40.440]  And again, I've been a fan of technology growing up, a fan of nuclear power, because I thought they would responsibly try to control it.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.900]  These big corporations will not do it.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.043]  So this is a serious, serious, serious situation.
[00:07:47.624 --> 00:07:54.568]  And we are going to be covering it with Mike Adams for 30 minutes or longer at the start of the second hour.
[00:07:55.555 --> 00:08:23.183]  Then I have Clyde Lewis joining us, who is just a real expert on the deep state, and I was on with him for three hours on his big syndicated show that comes on before George Norris on the same network, on the Premier Radio Network, and he was mentioning all this history and all this research that I had totally forgotten all these other agencies Obama set up, and the Kill Switch Office, and how they put these groups inside the FCC to take control of the internet, and
[00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:25.717]  It was blowing me away.
[00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:29.139]  And I was sitting there search engine-ing everything he was saying, like, oh, I forgot about that.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.120]  I forgot about this.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.861]  So, it's amazing.
[00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:32.982]  And it's important to know.
[00:08:33.422 --> 00:08:35.524]  And it's all coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:38.906]  Then Paul Watson has the gentleman joining him.
[00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:44.475]  Who had nine of his books banned in one day and Amazon admits that they've banned them.
[00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:45.816]  You can say, oh, they're a private company.
[00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:51.678]  Well, now the left is moving for people's credit card processors and their own online shopping carts.
[00:08:52.138 --> 00:08:59.561]  And the Washington Post has a big article out saying, as Alex Jones rails against big tech, his InfoWare stores still thrive online.
[00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:04.003]  And the article basically talks about how to take me down completely.
[00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:14.011]  And how I'm horrible because I, you know, sell supplements, but Jeff Bezos, that owns the Washington Post, is the biggest supplement salesman in the world.
[00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:24.717]  And nine of the supplements we sell are made by the same manufacturers as Whole Foods, that are actually high quality, that Bezos sells.
[00:09:25.717 --> 00:09:30.260]  And they even review some of the very things sold in Whole Foods under other names and say they're crap.
[00:09:32.814 --> 00:09:34.155]  In the New York Times and Washington Post.
[00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:42.619]  I mean, you talk about next, so I'm going to be revealing in the next week what products I have that are private labeled off of Whole Foods brands.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.561]  Some Whole Foods brands are not that good, some are excellent.
[00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:55.185]  We go to top labs in the country and we find out whatever's the highest rated, whatever's the best, can we private label that and then sell it for a lower price?
[00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:58.005]  Bezos can sell it all.
[00:09:58.125 --> 00:09:58.866]  He's a good guy.
[00:09:59.086 --> 00:09:59.446]  I do.
[00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:04.910]  And his criminal Washington Post, trying to overthrow this country, then demonizes me.
[00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.571]  What a sick freak.
[00:10:08.953 --> 00:10:11.575]  It is the 17th anniversary of 9-11.
[00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:11.575]  2001.
[00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:14.697]  What a tragedy.
[00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:18.220]  And they used that tragedy.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.762]  Clear government stand down, which has now been declassified.
[00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:22.423]  Part of the 28 pages has gone public.
[00:10:22.683 --> 00:10:23.824]  That they knew it was going on.
[00:10:23.864 --> 00:10:24.805]  They ordered a stand down.
[00:10:26.314 --> 00:10:27.615]  Saudi Arabia was heavily involved.
[00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:31.476]  Instead of going after Saudi Arabia, we went after Iraq, their archenemy.
[00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:35.198]  That's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.919]  We're going to be looking at all of that today as well.
[00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:40.800]  Very important transmission that no one wants to miss.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.442]  Let me just do this, in the time I have in this segment.
[00:10:46.102 --> 00:10:51.585]  Let me, document cam shot here of the big table, let me just show you
[00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:54.303]  The headlines.
[00:10:54.704 --> 00:10:57.886]  Hurricane Florence could threaten 10 nuclear power facilities.
[00:11:00.408 --> 00:11:05.052]  White House economist proves Trump reversed Obama's disastrous economic policies.
[00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:11.657]  Incredible 9-minute video we're going to be playing, where as soon as Trump gets in, the graphs are all going like this under Obama.
[00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:12.578]  It goes like this.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.461]  I mean, that's what the graphs look like.
[00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:18.383]  Or they go like this, and then it goes like this.
[00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:20.745]  I mean, it's the day he's elected.
[00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:22.086]  Now, why is that?
[00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:29.225]  Because the big corporations were directed not to invest here, and that America, under globalism, was to be de-industrialized.
[00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:31.286]  That's official from George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:11:31.606 --> 00:11:32.747]  That's when it really accelerated.
[00:11:33.448 --> 00:11:34.629]  It's in the UNESCO plan.
[00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:38.271]  Trump said, we're out of this plan, and he withdrew from UNESCO.
[00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.194]  And the first thing he did when he was president-elect was signal, we're getting out of the TPP.
[00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:45.796]  So that's all coming up.
[00:11:45.856 --> 00:11:46.577]  It's bombshell.
[00:11:47.757 --> 00:11:49.999]  And then, U.S.
[00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:51.880]  job openings climbed a record 6.9 million.
[00:11:54.175 --> 00:11:55.335]  Trump campaign manager.
[00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:57.956]  Google a direct threat to democracy and online freedom.
[00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:01.057]  And then it ties into all the draconian censorship.
[00:12:01.097 --> 00:12:02.617]  Fahrenheit 2018.
[00:12:02.997 --> 00:12:04.737]  Amazon begins banning controversial books.
[00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:09.838]  Not nabla books, but books telling guys how to be competent and confident.
[00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:16.520]  London mayor's approval rating hits its lowest point yet after summer of violence.
[00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.852]  Male fertility in the West is in rapid decline.
[00:12:22.212 --> 00:12:23.213]  Major scientific studies.
[00:12:23.794 --> 00:12:25.635]  And I got to this some yesterday, but it's back in the news.
[00:12:26.096 --> 00:12:28.818]  Young blood could be the secret to long-lasting life.
[00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:34.763]  Children's blood being sold by their parents for $8,000 a bag.
[00:12:38.606 --> 00:12:43.771]  I first broke 20 years ago that the Queen Mother took children's blood every day.
[00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:52.286]  See, that's why they want us off the air, because the Vatican being run by pedophiles, by Satanists.
[00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:55.109]  I told you, the raping the kids is only step one.
[00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:58.573]  Drinking their blood is what really goes on.
[00:12:59.353 --> 00:13:10.224]  And they torture children to death, and they excrete all their fear and their hormones, and it's done just like you read in Bram Stoker, or you see in the old black and white vampire movies where Dracula brings a baby to the women.
[00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:16.235]  That's actually an ancient 3,000 plus year old ritual from Babylon and Egypt.
[00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:18.516]  You can read it in ancient text.
[00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:20.137]  I mean this is in the archaeology.
[00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:28.860]  You would bring them to women and then they would lance the baby while it cries and a whole bunch of women would suck the blood out of the baby and then the men would have sex with the women.
[00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:35.143]  And then the women would do this obviously when they were menstruating and the men would drink that.
[00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:41.256]  I'm not kidding, this is 101 Satanism, ladies and gentlemen, and it's rampant.
[00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:42.817]  It's rampant.
[00:13:43.237 --> 00:13:43.957]  We're going to get into that.
[00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:47.399]  Sorry you have to hear this stuff, it's what's going on in Hollywood everywhere.
[00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:49.660]  Look, raping kids is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.381]  Right beneath that is vampirism.
[00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:54.842]  More children are dying by suicide.
[00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:56.743]  Researchers are asking why, USA Today.
[00:13:56.903 --> 00:13:59.524]  Because you teach them death education that teaches them how to commit suicide.
[00:14:01.218 --> 00:14:06.580]  South Africa, their government says close to a war zone with 57 murders a day, a lot of them white.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.961]  But our media says no whites are being killed, no African countries ever killed any whites or kicked them out, even though six just did it.
[00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:18.623]  The border has massive surges, 200 plus percent arrest rate of illegals coming across.
[00:14:18.643 --> 00:14:21.664]  We're going to get into all that, a lot of them Islamic and others.
[00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.565]  That's just some of what's coming up today.
[00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.226]  Now that said,
[00:14:28.803 --> 00:14:33.545]  I did not time this for the fact that there's nuclear power plants that could be leaking or hit by this hurricane.
[00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:35.566]  I did not time this.
[00:14:35.986 --> 00:14:36.767]  It's just a fact.
[00:14:36.827 --> 00:14:44.370]  I've told you for a long time that I don't take clean, pure, deep-earth crystal iodine because I'm worried about radiation.
[00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:47.912]  That's only for one type that goes into the thyroid during a meltdown.
[00:14:48.672 --> 00:14:49.513]  Radioactive iodine.
[00:14:50.093 --> 00:14:53.474]  So good iodine fills your thyroid, so the bad iodine doesn't get in there.
[00:14:53.534 --> 00:14:54.495]  The radioactive iodine.
[00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.212]  I take it because you die without iodine.
[00:14:58.352 --> 00:15:00.353]  It's associated with IQ, everything.
[00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:01.754]  You have to have it.
[00:15:01.774 --> 00:15:03.274]  It's like vitamin C. It's like oxygen.
[00:15:03.294 --> 00:15:04.135]  It's like water.
[00:15:05.516 --> 00:15:06.836]  And most of it's bound up.
[00:15:07.317 --> 00:15:08.377]  Deficiencies are insane.
[00:15:08.437 --> 00:15:10.198]  Anybody can search mainline studies.
[00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:15.381]  15 point IQ increases when people get higher levels of iodine during childhood development.
[00:15:17.062 --> 00:15:20.124]  We have the very best deep earth crystal iodine.
[00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:31.197]  And the oil companies that get it between 7,000 and 11,000 feet have been jacking up prices in the last few years, as we're the only ones that have this Deep Earth Crystal source.
[00:15:31.977 --> 00:15:32.897]  It's all proprietary.
[00:15:33.698 --> 00:15:37.839]  So I put in a really big order last time and played guts ball and said, you've got to cut prices.
[00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:38.259]  They didn't.
[00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:39.400]  So I broke the contract.
[00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.494]  And this is the last.
[00:15:41.854 --> 00:15:43.015]  We may be able to get another source.
[00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:43.955]  We're working on it right now.
[00:15:44.295 --> 00:15:51.860]  But if you want X2, our best-selling, amazing product that blows every other so-called iodine away, it's available 25% off at infowarsstore.com.

[00:17:40.113 --> 00:17:41.034]  You know we're changing the world.
[00:17:41.074 --> 00:17:41.674]  This isn't hype.
[00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:45.778]  We need you to get off the bench and come into this historical win.
[00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.510]  I don't know.
[00:17:57.162 --> 00:17:59.524]  Bottom line, there is a war going on for humanity.
[00:17:59.664 --> 00:18:00.885]  That is the final equation.
[00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:05.748]  There is a war for the future of our destiny, and right now is the time for everybody to get off the bench and get in the game.
[00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:07.890]  So I want to thank those that have been off the bench in the game.
[00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.893]  I want to ask those that have been in the game some, but not as much as they could, to get more in the game.
[00:18:12.353 --> 00:18:20.119]  And I want to ask those that have not been in the game, to whatever you do, spread the articles at InfoWars.com, the videos, download them, re-upload them, share them.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.302]  They're trying to stop us because we're having an effect, thanks to you.
[00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:29.491]  So again, I want to salute you all and thank you all and ask you to think about InfoWars every day because without you, we're nothing.

[00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:53.528]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:19:54.148 --> 00:19:56.711]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:19:57.471 --> 00:19:59.413]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:19:59.994 --> 00:20:02.336]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:08.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:27.689]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.514]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:20:55.652 --> 00:21:11.994]  Coming up in the next segment, I am going to air the White House chief economist's incredible, the head of his economic council's incredible, breakdown with 10 different charts he shows using federal numbers of the complete turnaround of the economy.
[00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:21.000]  Now radio listeners, you'll want to go to Infowars.com forward slash show and you will want to see this for yourself.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.701]  That's not even one of the most dramatic charts.
[00:21:23.322 --> 00:21:32.708]  They've got six or seven of them go straight up the day Trump is elected because America is open for business again and the globalists have been prohibiting our economy from growing by design.
[00:21:32.728 --> 00:21:34.249]  That's an admission under UN treaty.
[00:21:35.229 --> 00:21:36.210]  So that's all coming up.
[00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:44.095]  But for radio listeners, I will just pause it and point out verbally what the chart is showing and the numbers that it's showing.
[00:21:44.135 --> 00:21:46.436]  But the full video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:21:46.896 --> 00:21:49.438]  I know Paul Watts is going to tweet it out at Prison Planet.
[00:21:50.638 --> 00:21:52.719]  This is what the globalists are fighting to keep you from seeing.
[00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:55.701]  I mean, if you're a TV viewer, look at that dramaticness.
[00:21:55.741 --> 00:22:02.065]  The red line in the middle shows the day that Trump was elected.
[00:22:03.174 --> 00:22:06.936]  And then look at the absolute parabolic straight up afterwards.
[00:22:07.237 --> 00:22:07.697]  Unbelievable.
[00:22:07.957 --> 00:22:08.637]  But that's next segment.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.943]  I want to hit a giant media hoax that has been on MSNBC.
[00:22:17.863 --> 00:22:18.944]  It's been on CNN.
[00:22:19.044 --> 00:22:21.646]  It's been on a bunch of online news services.
[00:22:23.887 --> 00:22:29.771]  And when it was happening, I had a feeling it was going to happen because everything we do gets turned upside down.
[00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:33.659]  That's all the left does.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.300]  They're murderers of the truth.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:52.426]  So I walk out of the Senate hearing Wednesday at like 1 o'clock, getting ready to go over to the House hearings, and these women come over.
[00:22:54.087 --> 00:22:56.628]  And they start screaming and yelling at me and calling me a monkey.
[00:22:57.611 --> 00:23:01.613]  By the time we turn the camera on, I think, oh God, we didn't catch them calling me a monkey.
[00:23:02.173 --> 00:23:10.117]  No, they keep calling me a monkey, you're an inbred white person, your mother's married to her brother, you're a monkey, you're a pilgrim, get out of here.
[00:23:14.399 --> 00:23:20.302]  And I'm just used to the left's total racism that whites are the devil, so I start saying you're brown KKK.
[00:23:20.362 --> 00:23:22.883]  Guarantee these women were members of Mecha and La Raza.
[00:23:23.183 --> 00:23:24.484]  They were spewing their propaganda.
[00:23:26.513 --> 00:23:36.395]  So they're in my face doing all this, and sure enough, National News, you name it, edited this all together, and I started getting calls about it.
[00:23:38.863 --> 00:23:39.924]  Even one of my lawyers called me.
[00:23:39.944 --> 00:23:43.506]  He's like, Alex, you probably shouldn't be yelling at Hispanic women and calling them racist for no reason.
[00:23:43.866 --> 00:23:45.528]  I'm like, did you watch the full tape?
[00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:46.448]  No, you didn't.
[00:23:46.949 --> 00:23:48.630]  So that's how these hoaxes work.
[00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.392]  Some guy in Missouri pushes a kid over that's punched him four times in the face.
[00:23:53.213 --> 00:23:56.535]  The National News says I beat up a kid and I'm taking off YouTube.
[00:23:58.076 --> 00:23:58.877]  These are hoaxes.
[00:24:01.658 --> 00:24:04.100]  These are total and complete hoaxes.
[00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:06.382]  And I'm going to show you the proof
[00:24:07.486 --> 00:24:08.947]  Of the hoax right now.
[00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:16.252]  Now here is a quick 14 second compilation of these women that came up to me yelling at me.
[00:24:16.272 --> 00:24:17.653]  We didn't even catch the first of it.
[00:24:17.974 --> 00:24:19.635]  We'll play the full unedited clip in a moment.
[00:24:20.015 --> 00:24:20.555]  Yelling at me.
[00:24:22.237 --> 00:24:23.457]  And calling me racist names.
[00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:27.080]  And then we'll play the full interaction.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:34.725]  Then we'll play now this news and others and the way they edited it deceptively engaged in fraud.
[00:24:34.765 --> 00:24:35.086]  Here it is.
[00:24:36.704 --> 00:24:37.605]  You're a colonizer!
[00:24:37.645 --> 00:24:38.246]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:38.266 --> 00:24:39.288]  There you go, racist.
[00:24:39.308 --> 00:24:40.289]  You're a racist.
[00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:40.870]  That's all.
[00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:41.471]  And that's all.
[00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:59.725]  Now, here is the unedited interaction once we turned our cameras on, about 30 seconds into her calling me a monkey.
[00:25:00.426 --> 00:25:06.609]  And you can hear her calling me a monkey again and again, and saying that my mother again married her brother, and that I'm a pilgrim and need to leave.
[00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:10.251]  And I just pointed out that Native Americans weren't perfect angels either, or killing each other.
[00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:11.171]  I'm part Native American.
[00:25:11.332 --> 00:25:12.632]  But I didn't play that card with that lady.
[00:25:13.213 --> 00:25:14.954]  Or that my sister's Korean adopted, or any of that.
[00:25:14.994 --> 00:25:15.214]  No, no, no.
[00:25:15.274 --> 00:25:15.834]  I'm a white guy.
[00:25:15.854 --> 00:25:16.174]  I'm bad.
[00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:16.514]  I get it.
[00:25:17.135 --> 00:25:19.676]  She's literally brown KKK in my opinion.
[00:25:19.696 --> 00:25:20.477]  That's what she's acting like.
[00:25:20.657 --> 00:25:20.937]  Here it is.
[00:25:21.874 --> 00:25:23.995]  Did you see how I told you that was a bait-and-switch?
[00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:25.937]  Did you see how they bait-and-switched us?
[00:25:26.377 --> 00:25:30.039]  He's banned from all social media for his right-wing ignorance.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.580]  So there you go.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.462]  This is another fascist leftist who wants my speech banned.
[00:25:34.563 --> 00:25:39.486]  And look, she's strutting around arrogantly saying it's good that people are getting banned.
[00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:41.787]  So you don't support the First Amendment, do you?
[00:25:41.827 --> 00:25:42.428]  I support everything.
[00:25:42.508 --> 00:25:43.308]  I serve this country.
[00:25:43.328 --> 00:25:44.289]  What did you do?
[00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:45.970]  What did you do?
[00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.252]  You just got really excited about going, oh, he got banned, all the bunch of stuff.
[00:25:50.453 --> 00:25:50.933]  I pity you.
[00:25:50.953 --> 00:25:51.454]  I pity you.
[00:25:51.474 --> 00:25:51.874]  I pity you.
[00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:52.294]  I pity you.
[00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:52.774]  I pity you.
[00:25:52.794 --> 00:25:53.515]  I pity you.
[00:25:53.595 --> 00:25:53.935]  I pity you.
[00:25:53.955 --> 00:25:54.255]  I pity you.
[00:25:54.275 --> 00:25:54.636]  I pity you.
[00:25:54.696 --> 00:25:55.076]  I pity you.
[00:25:55.096 --> 00:25:55.436]  I pity you.
[00:25:55.456 --> 00:25:55.856]  I pity you.
[00:25:55.876 --> 00:25:56.096]  I pity you.
[00:25:56.176 --> 00:25:56.697]  I pity you.
[00:25:56.717 --> 00:25:57.137]  I pity you.
[00:25:57.197 --> 00:25:57.557]  I pity you.
[00:25:57.597 --> 00:25:57.897]  I pity you.
[00:25:57.917 --> 00:25:58.318]  I pity you.
[00:25:58.338 --> 00:25:58.658]  I pity you.
[00:25:58.678 --> 00:25:59.118]  I pity you.
[00:25:59.138 --> 00:25:59.398]  I pity you.
[00:25:59.418 --> 00:25:59.678]  I pity you.
[00:25:59.698 --> 00:26:00.179]  I pity you.
[00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:00.659]  I pity you.
[00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:01.019]  I pity you.
[00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:01.640]  I pity you.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.180]  I pity you.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.480]  I pity you.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.040]  I pity you.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.561]  I pity you.
[00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:03.921]  I pity you.
[00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:04.341]  I pity you.
[00:26:04.381 --> 00:26:04.941]  I pity you.
[00:26:04.961 --> 00:26:05.382]  I pity you.
[00:26:05.482 --> 00:26:05.962]  I pity you.
[00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:07.163]  I pity you.
[00:26:07.183 --> 00:26:07.503]  I pity you.
[00:26:07.623 --> 00:26:08.083]  I pity you.
[00:26:08.103 --> 00:26:08.544]  I pity you.
[00:26:08.704 --> 00:26:08.924]  I pity you.
[00:26:08.964 --> 00:26:09.444]  I pity you.
[00:26:09.504 --> 00:26:09.904]  I pity you.
[00:26:10.024 --> 00:26:10.345]  I pity you.
[00:26:10.405 --> 00:26:10.805]  I pity you.
[00:26:10.825 --> 00:26:11.145]  I pity you.
[00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:11.605]  I pity you.
[00:26:11.645 --> 00:26:12.046]  I pity you.
[00:26:12.086 --> 00:26:12.586]  I pity you.
[00:26:12.706 --> 00:26:13.086]  I pity you.
[00:26:13.126 --> 00:26:13.566]  I pity you.
[00:26:13.626 --> 00:26:13.907]  I pity you.
[00:26:13.927 --> 00:26:14.367]  I pity you.
[00:26:14.387 --> 00:26:14.627]  I pity you.
[00:26:14.707 --> 00:26:15.027]  I pity you.
[00:26:15.067 --> 00:26:15.367]  I pity you.
[00:26:15.428 --> 00:26:15.928]  I pity you.
[00:26:16.448 --> 00:26:18.971]  And then all the Native Americans did was kill each other for thousands of years.
[00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:19.572]  Prove that!
[00:26:19.612 --> 00:26:20.413]  Prove that!
[00:26:20.473 --> 00:26:21.134]  Yeah, prove that.
[00:26:21.154 --> 00:26:23.717]  Oh, I guess... It's all just garbage.
[00:26:23.737 --> 00:26:30.005]  Hey, if the militia is so bad... By the way, those women look like they might be a quarter Native American.
[00:26:31.647 --> 00:26:35.151]  I know I have a lot of family that's more Native American than I am, and grandparents and stuff that were, you know...
[00:26:36.266 --> 00:26:37.907]  My grandfather was as brown as these ladies.
[00:26:38.487 --> 00:26:39.848]  He was a hell of a lot better looking, though.
[00:26:39.868 --> 00:26:41.368]  He was, you know, Comanche background.
[00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:44.390]  Those are, you know, the best looking Indians there are, so I'm glad to have a little bit of that.
[00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:44.850]  I'm proud of it.
[00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:51.553]  But the point is, Lords of the Plains, these folks look more like they got some Aztec background to me, which is fine.
[00:26:52.474 --> 00:26:55.355]  And then they're mainly Spanish, who were the original colonizers.
[00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:58.617]  So, she's telling me that has ancestors that were colonizers, that I'm a colonizer.
[00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:05.080]  Lady, 100 percent, I bet her $10,000 if she goes and takes a genetic test, that she's Castilian Spanish, probably half.
[00:27:06.055 --> 00:27:08.796]  And then probably part African, because the Africans took over Spain for a while.
[00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:10.176]  She doesn't know any of this.
[00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:16.297]  You've got this literal Castilian pointing her finger at me, saying I'm a colonizer, when they're the original colonizers.
[00:27:16.457 --> 00:27:17.778]  And I wouldn't be ashamed if I was Spanish.
[00:27:19.478 --> 00:27:20.738]  The Spanish liberated.
[00:27:21.159 --> 00:27:23.139]  Let me tell you, the Aztecs, boy, they were in hell on earth.
[00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:24.039]  Let's go back to it.
[00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:25.580]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.840]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.940]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.680]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:34.581]  Yeah, go back home, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:35.202]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:35.242 --> 00:27:36.823]  Here you go, racist.
[00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:37.824]  You're a racist.
[00:27:37.844 --> 00:27:41.467]  And that's all Van Jones teaches.
[00:27:41.927 --> 00:27:44.710]  That's all Van Jones teaches is you guys racist.
[00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.471]  You're Brown KKK.
[00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:46.091]  Brown KKK.
[00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:47.512]  Brown KKK, go away.
[00:27:47.612 --> 00:27:49.154]  Brown KKK, go away.
[00:27:49.174 --> 00:27:50.155]  Brown KKK, go away.
[00:27:50.215 --> 00:27:51.095]  Brown KKK, go away.
[00:27:51.135 --> 00:27:51.856]  Brown KKK, go away.
[00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:52.717]  Brown KKK, go away.
[00:27:58.982 --> 00:27:59.562]  Brown KKK!
[00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:03.563]  Talk bad about my mother because she's white and said white people are bad!
[00:28:03.783 --> 00:28:04.803]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:05.044 --> 00:28:05.624]  Go away!
[00:28:05.644 --> 00:28:07.604]  Learn about Martin Luther King!
[00:28:07.844 --> 00:28:09.565]  Learn how to not be a racist!
[00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:10.945]  Learn how to not be a racist!
[00:28:10.985 --> 00:28:12.325]  Learn how to not be a racist!
[00:28:12.365 --> 00:28:13.506]  Learn how to not be a racist!
[00:28:13.846 --> 00:28:14.366]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:14.386 --> 00:28:15.186]  Go away!
[00:28:15.246 --> 00:28:16.326]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:16.967]  Go away!
[00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:17.587]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:17.627 --> 00:28:17.887]  Go away!
[00:28:17.927 --> 00:28:18.227]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:18.287 --> 00:28:18.887]  Go away!
[00:28:19.067 --> 00:28:20.127]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:20.928]  Go away!
[00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:21.468]  Brown KKK!
[00:28:21.488 --> 00:28:21.968]  Go away!
[00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.810]  Brown KKK go away!
[00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:28.791]  Brown KKK go away!
[00:28:28.811 --> 00:28:29.851]  Brown KKK go away!
[00:28:29.891 --> 00:28:30.952]  Brown KKK go away!
[00:28:30.972 --> 00:28:32.013]  Brown KKK go away!
[00:28:32.073 --> 00:28:32.834]  Brown KKK go away!
[00:28:48.444 --> 00:28:49.366]  Say some more racist stuff!
[00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:53.192]  Now, the media then said... We're going to come back with the rest of this.
[00:28:53.212 --> 00:28:55.176]  Oh, my mom and my dad, our brother and sister.
[00:28:55.196 --> 00:29:01.387]  We're going to come back and then show how the media edited it to lie to you and defraud you because they are the enemy of the American people.
[00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:01.807]  Stay with us.
[00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:11.792]  Let's go to Jason in New Mexico.
[00:29:11.852 --> 00:29:12.392]  Fire away.
[00:29:12.432 --> 00:29:13.513]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:29:13.533 --> 00:29:16.314]  Shout out to you, the crew, and all those that work behind the scenes.
[00:29:16.334 --> 00:29:26.598]  And I would tell everybody to commit to the super blue toothpaste and the Survival Shield X2 so you don't turn into a transsexual, gay, toad, and run as a demon.
[00:29:26.658 --> 00:29:27.919]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:31.820]  Hey, I just came out as a transsexual gay toad.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.661]  I'm not going to have you slander my people before I run for office as a Democrat.
[00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:42.323]  I know that's right, but really, we should contribute to you guys because I've been given for years and I've seen the production value just skyrocket.
[00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:46.725]  I mean, your graphics team, just the content in general, everything is going great.
[00:29:46.825 --> 00:29:53.267]  And at the same time, there's no better organization that I could give my dollars to, to see it at work on a daily basis.
[00:29:53.547 --> 00:29:57.128]  Well, and we appreciate you, Jason, and that's why we try to give you the best products.
[00:29:57.148 --> 00:29:59.669]  You know, we just don't put something out there and say, hey, please buy it.
[00:29:59.769 --> 00:30:04.010]  We do the research and then actually put out the best possible product.
[00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:13.712]  In the five years of my support, I have never bought a bad product, and I waste a lot of money on, you know, you go to one of these big box stores, you buy a piece of crap, and the psychologist throw away $10.
[00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:18.273]  You throw $10 at that toothpaste, guarantee it won't be a waste, especially if you love your kids.
[00:30:18.293 --> 00:30:19.974]  Why would you give them fluoride?
[00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:21.214]  Yeah, yeah, just don't look
[00:30:21.474 --> 00:30:22.916]  You know, here's what I would say to the audience.
[00:30:22.996 --> 00:30:31.223]  If you're not using super blue fluoride toothpaste, go home and look at the toothpaste that you're using, and on the back of it, it will say, harmful if swallowed.
[00:30:31.523 --> 00:30:37.629]  Contact poison control for 0.01% of fluoride.
[00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.170]  0.01% harmful if swallowed.
[00:30:39.351 --> 00:30:40.492]  They put that in the water.
[00:30:40.532 --> 00:30:41.873]  Yep, that's if you love the kids, though.
[00:30:41.913 --> 00:30:43.655]  Hey, I'm not telling you how to spend your money.
[00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:44.355]  Yeah, you know what, good point.
[00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.477]  If you don't love your kids, just keep giving them the fluoride.
[00:30:46.497 --> 00:30:47.078]  Yeah, that's fine.
[00:30:48.619 --> 00:30:54.341]  No matter what the globalists want to do, no matter what politicians want to do, this country is going to make it!
[00:31:02.992 --> 00:31:07.696]  He's made it more popular, I think, to be openly racist.
[00:31:07.876 --> 00:31:12.800]  Because this president, I will quote Steve Schmidt, is a stone-cold racist.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.182]  They must be really hitting this tone hard right now.
[00:31:15.222 --> 00:31:16.083]  That's the talking point.
[00:31:16.123 --> 00:31:16.563]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:16.723 --> 00:31:19.165]  So this is the reason... Trump just signed a thing that will save millions of people!
[00:31:19.405 --> 00:31:20.406]  RACIST!
[00:31:20.947 --> 00:31:21.847]  The economy's coming back!
[00:31:22.087 --> 00:31:23.248]  RACIST!
[00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:26.731]  All the numbers say the Republicans are going to win Congress in the midterms!
[00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:27.872]  RACIST!
[00:31:28.072 --> 00:31:32.055]  Oh my god, the giant blue wave, now a red wave, the historic Trump's dominating!
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.743]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power.
[00:31:38.783 --> 00:31:40.204]  It must be racist!
[00:31:40.464 --> 00:31:42.966]  MS-13 can't torture little girls to death for Satan.
[00:31:43.146 --> 00:31:44.227]  Racist!
[00:31:44.327 --> 00:31:48.170]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes.
[00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:48.730]  Racist!
[00:31:48.990 --> 00:32:00.398]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[00:33:24.739 --> 00:33:29.404]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.379 --> 00:33:47.280]  So, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.583]  Thanks for joining us on this September 11th, 17th year anniversary.
[00:33:50.603 --> 00:34:01.950]  Right now we're looking into the incredible deception of corporate media because I just picked one of the news channels that deceptively edited this.
[00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.732]  This was put out by the Media Matters crowd.
[00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:08.155]  They give the orders and then the media then picks up the lie.
[00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:16.137]  They edit the tapes, they put them out, then those all get picked up by everybody, and mainstream media all works in unison and then lie.
[00:34:16.697 --> 00:34:22.040]  As you've just seen with me being banned on Twitter, or Facebook, or Google, or off the Apple app last week.
[00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:31.444]  All of them published hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles at 447 with the Twitter ban, five hours after they decided to ban me.
[00:34:31.704 --> 00:34:34.746]  They got their story together, they lied, they took me down.
[00:34:36.684 --> 00:34:38.104]  And it's the same thing with every one of these.
[00:34:38.344 --> 00:34:39.505]  Oh, did you hear?
[00:34:39.605 --> 00:34:42.385]  Alex Jones bullied some poor Native American women.
[00:34:43.386 --> 00:34:46.206]  They don't want their names known because they're afraid of retaliation.
[00:34:46.867 --> 00:34:50.687]  He ran up and attacked them for no reason, just on the street, because they were natives.
[00:34:51.448 --> 00:34:53.468]  And it was a horrible KKK event.
[00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:56.529]  And they play sad music.
[00:34:56.549 --> 00:34:57.609]  I'm going to play the piece in a minute.
[00:34:58.709 --> 00:35:01.790]  They just... Meanwhile, they're screaming, hey, you white monkey!
[00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.651]  I'm like, whoa, turn your cameras on!
[00:35:07.093 --> 00:35:08.393]  Hey, Pilgrim, get out of here!
[00:35:08.593 --> 00:35:10.234]  He got banned because he's hateful!
[00:35:10.494 --> 00:35:11.194]  Get rid of him!
[00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:13.454]  Your mother married her brother!
[00:35:14.415 --> 00:35:15.495]  You white monkey!
[00:35:15.515 --> 00:35:20.136]  And I'm like, whoa, you're racist!
[00:35:20.156 --> 00:35:20.936]  You're brown KKK!
[00:35:21.056 --> 00:35:22.157]  I don't like the KKK or you!
[00:35:22.397 --> 00:35:23.497]  Get away from me, KKK!
[00:35:24.977 --> 00:35:27.278]  I had some crazy white women run over and say I was a Nazi, too.
[00:35:27.478 --> 00:35:28.258]  That video's coming up.
[00:35:28.538 --> 00:35:30.198]  Because I'm being confronted out there by these people.
[00:35:30.979 --> 00:35:32.159]  They're all stumbling around.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.300]  Ticking their chest up to me.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.961]  Hey, white, white man, total racist garbage.
[00:35:38.141 --> 00:35:41.462]  Meanwhile, these women look like maybe they're 25% Native American.
[00:35:41.942 --> 00:35:42.242]  Maybe.
[00:35:44.122 --> 00:35:51.443]  I mean, their Spanish background, the original colonizers, it's, it's lunatic land, but they act like it's some royalty.
[00:35:51.704 --> 00:35:53.804]  That, oh, I'm Native American.
[00:35:54.804 --> 00:35:55.044]  Oh.
[00:35:57.385 --> 00:35:59.185]  Truly incredible.
[00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:04.342]  You got this lady, she looks like she's from North Africa, which you get a lot.
[00:36:04.382 --> 00:36:06.164]  I mean, I'm into genetics, they're interesting.
[00:36:07.345 --> 00:36:17.036]  A lot of folks in Spain, half of Spain got taken over for a couple hundred years by the Muslims and the Moors, and they were a mix of Asian and white and African.
[00:36:17.056 --> 00:36:19.919]  That's what Arabic basically, that whole area is in North Africa.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.282]  And so these folks don't even know their genetic background.
[00:36:22.822 --> 00:36:25.944]  I mean, you're part black, you're part really Germanic.
[00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:30.788]  The tribes in Spain were more Germanic than Gaulish.
[00:36:31.168 --> 00:36:35.171]  If you actually knew that before the invasion, they were blonde-haired, blue-eyed, just like the Romans.
[00:36:35.771 --> 00:36:38.553]  Romans didn't have dark hair until they got invaded by the Moors as well.
[00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:43.957]  So, oh yeah, 2,000 years ago, Romans looked like me.
[00:36:45.338 --> 00:36:47.420]  If you look at pictures of Julius Caesar, it looks about like me.
[00:36:48.283 --> 00:36:50.424]  So, that's the reality here.
[00:36:50.524 --> 00:36:53.846]  And look, the whole point is, lady, you've got colonizer in you.
[00:36:54.967 --> 00:36:57.648]  And the Native Americans were always running around killing each other.
[00:36:57.808 --> 00:36:59.970]  They were more warlike than you can imagine.
[00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.530]  And everybody was warlike.
[00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:09.475]  The Scots were always killing each other, and the Irish were always killing each other, and the Brits were always killing each other, until they got big populations and they killed other tribes.
[00:37:10.035 --> 00:37:10.976]  That's a normal thing.
[00:37:11.836 --> 00:37:16.619]  So, just like they recognize conquest,
[00:37:18.412 --> 00:37:22.636]  All over the world, in Africa, every African tribe recognizes the right of conquest.
[00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:25.258]  If you can take somebody's land by force, it's yours.
[00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:33.624]  So this whole thing of like, oh, we were mean to the natives, oh, yeah, oh.
[00:37:34.224 --> 00:37:42.471]  When we got here, and I had family on both sides on the Mayflower, related to the captain of the Mayflower, whole nine yards, mile standish.
[00:37:48.851 --> 00:37:56.135]  When they got here, trying to have religious freedom, the Native Americans came to them and they said, you're going to help us take over the next tribe and we're going to kill your ass.
[00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:00.957]  Because those tribes all had beefs like crips and bloods with each other.
[00:38:01.317 --> 00:38:02.458]  But again, that's the real history.
[00:38:02.638 --> 00:38:07.500]  And I'm not saying the Natives were bad, that's just, go see the movie Revenant if you want to know how the Native Americans operated.
[00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:09.481]  Some groups were really, really nice.
[00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:12.123]  Some groups will kill you for no reason.
[00:38:13.263 --> 00:38:14.684]  It's just like any other group of people.
[00:38:16.331 --> 00:38:19.574]  And it depended on if they knew you'd been attacked by one group, they suddenly liked you.
[00:38:19.654 --> 00:38:22.176]  But if they thought you'd attacked their group, you're dead in a hammer.
[00:38:22.456 --> 00:38:23.337]  Very accurate.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.882]  But I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:31.044 --> 00:38:32.786]  So these women run up to me and they do this.
[00:38:35.768 --> 00:38:39.709]  And then the news takes it and says that I was being racist and mean to Native American women.
[00:38:40.029 --> 00:38:41.129]  They came and got in my face.
[00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.690]  They called me a bunch of racial names.
[00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:46.671]  I just said, you're Brown KKK, which is what Matt Shalala-Rossi is.
[00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:48.211]  These women aren't in that.
[00:38:48.231 --> 00:38:48.892]  I'll eat my hat.
[00:38:51.192 --> 00:38:51.672]  It's sick.
[00:38:51.712 --> 00:38:53.313]  So let's go ahead and finish up the clip.
[00:38:53.353 --> 00:38:53.553]  Here it is.
[00:38:54.771 --> 00:38:55.832]  Brown KKK!
[00:38:55.852 --> 00:38:57.772]  Brown KKK, go away!
[00:38:58.073 --> 00:39:00.494]  Brown KKK, go away!
[00:39:00.514 --> 00:39:01.994]  They're just like the Klan!
[00:39:02.434 --> 00:39:04.095]  They're just brown!
[00:39:04.115 --> 00:39:06.276]  Brown KKK, go away!
[00:39:07.056 --> 00:39:08.237]  Say some more racist stuff, ladies.
[00:39:08.257 --> 00:39:10.438]  Show us what Van Jones taught you.
[00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:11.398]  That's right, that's right.
[00:39:11.438 --> 00:39:12.699]  My mom and dad are brother and sister.
[00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:15.320]  Well, brown KKK, go away!
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.061]  I know I like my 150 IQ, lady.
[00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:19.982]  Brown KKK, go away!
[00:39:28.347 --> 00:39:29.448]  So, there you go.
[00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:34.971]  And then more ladies ran over five minutes later and got in my face saying I was a Nazi.
[00:39:35.011 --> 00:39:37.573]  And when I dared talk back to them, they went, oh, you're being mean to me!
[00:39:37.913 --> 00:39:39.454]  That's their operating system.
[00:39:39.755 --> 00:39:46.199]  Now, let's go to NowThis News Network piece, edited with sad music in the background.
[00:39:47.339 --> 00:39:49.201]  And I'll read the text for radio listeners.
[00:39:49.221 --> 00:39:49.481]  Here it is.
[00:39:51.474 --> 00:39:56.078]  Alex Jones verbally abused these Native American women by calling them Brown KKK.
[00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:02.804]  They paused.
[00:40:03.164 --> 00:40:07.708]  Now they cut to other shots of my own video and then loop audio to deceive you.
[00:40:08.068 --> 00:40:08.489]  Continue.
[00:40:13.653 --> 00:40:16.916]  The group of Native Americans who wish to remain anonymous traveled to D.C.
[00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:19.218]  to attend the hearing of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
[00:40:22.012 --> 00:40:26.055]  And call attention to what they say is his poor record of treatment of Native Americans.
[00:40:29.858 --> 00:40:32.701]  One of the women says she saw Jones' confrontation with Senator Marco Rubio.
[00:40:34.782 --> 00:40:38.385]  And she brought up that Jones was kicked off various social media platforms.
[00:40:39.846 --> 00:40:41.848]  That's when she says he went off on her.
[00:40:43.787 --> 00:40:47.689]  He's strutting around arrogantly saying it's good that people are getting banned.
[00:40:47.729 --> 00:40:50.010]  So you don't support the First Amendment, do you?
[00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.190]  I support everything.
[00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.391]  I serve this country.
[00:40:52.651 --> 00:40:54.632]  So now it sounds like, I'm a veteran.
[00:40:54.672 --> 00:40:55.612]  I love America.
[00:40:55.632 --> 00:41:00.735]  And then they cut, cut, cut, cut, cut her, call me a monkey, attack my mother, my father, call me an inbred white person.
[00:41:02.055 --> 00:41:03.616]  Go back to Europe, all edited.
[00:41:03.856 --> 00:41:04.756]  I'm just a veteran.
[00:41:04.776 --> 00:41:05.597]  You're being so mean.
[00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:06.077]  Continue.
[00:41:08.648 --> 00:41:12.029]  You're a colonizer!
[00:41:12.189 --> 00:41:13.369]  You're a racist!
[00:41:13.389 --> 00:41:14.690]  You came across the Bering Strait!
[00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.870]  And then all the Native Americans did was kill each other for thousands of years!
[00:41:18.471 --> 00:41:19.051]  Prove that!
[00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:20.151]  Prove that!
[00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:22.572]  It's all just garbage.
[00:41:22.592 --> 00:41:25.392]  Hey, if America is so bad, why does everybody want to come here?
[00:41:25.412 --> 00:41:27.413]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[00:41:27.693 --> 00:41:30.874]  Why don't you go to Venezuela with nothing but wonderful indigenous people?
[00:41:30.894 --> 00:41:33.334]  Why don't you go to Venezuela?
[00:41:33.374 --> 00:41:34.595]  Go back home, blah blah blah.
[00:41:38.752 --> 00:41:40.014]  You picked a fight with the wrong woman.
[00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:42.999]  Jones and his website, InfoWars, were recently suspended by Twitter.
[00:41:44.321 --> 00:41:47.887]  Aw, listen to the sad music.
[00:41:47.907 --> 00:41:48.768]  They're such good liberals.
[00:41:49.753 --> 00:41:54.315]  We need to stand up to people like Alex Jones, especially when they mask their hate speech and write behind the First Amendment.
[00:41:54.815 --> 00:41:55.475]  Woman's Statement.
[00:41:56.095 --> 00:41:56.556]  Now this.
[00:41:57.376 --> 00:42:02.338]  Jones needs to take off his racist glasses and recognize that all brown people come from all different walks of life.
[00:42:02.858 --> 00:42:03.498]  Woman's Statement.
[00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:07.039]  Oh, those poor baby mothers are like, ah, we hate white people!
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.820]  You're in red scum, monkey!
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.202]  KKK-style rhetoric that the KKK would say about a black person, about me.
[00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:18.784]  But then they all, they knowingly edited all that to take it out to deceive and defraud you.
[00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:26.310]  Coming up, Media Matters has edited a bunch of statements I've made to make it sound like I'm being violent to attack Dana Loesch that defended me, or Dana Loesch.
[00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.370]  That's all coming up.
[00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:31.132]  But first, the amazing economic numbers with the head of the President's Council.
[00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:32.072]  They don't want you to see.
[00:42:32.412 --> 00:42:33.773]  Tell friends and family, tune in right now.
[00:42:33.893 --> 00:42:36.034]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:38.975]  Don't forget, they banned the Apple app when it had millions of downloads.
[00:42:39.395 --> 00:42:43.777]  But you can still get the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app from Google Play.
[00:42:44.217 --> 00:42:47.058]  It'll still be on your phone when and if they delete it.
[00:42:47.378 --> 00:42:49.959]  As it goes, well, it's at number one on news, but they don't show that.
[00:42:50.379 --> 00:42:54.184]  So, Infowars.com forward slash app, and don't forget, we have our last run of X2.
[00:42:54.304 --> 00:42:58.509]  Unfortunately, we can't get X2 anymore, the best product out there, but that's just the way it is.
[00:42:58.830 --> 00:42:59.811]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.402]  You've got this evil pope.
[00:43:10.427 --> 00:43:15.810]  That Leo Zegami predicted five years before he was Pope, would be Pope, that he's pedophilia to blackmail him in.
[00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.532]  I've been to Rome, met with Zegami.
[00:43:17.612 --> 00:43:21.094]  Zegami has been up, you know, working at the highest levels with Berlusconi and others.
[00:43:21.654 --> 00:43:23.816]  And he's really the preeminent expert on this.
[00:43:23.856 --> 00:43:26.837]  And the word is, they're saying he may resign any time.
[00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:28.138]  That's leozegami.com.
[00:43:28.158 --> 00:43:29.539]  But I mean, am I accurate in this?
[00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:34.903]  Because you've, you know, you've been in the P2 Lodge, you've been in the secret societies, you've been an insider and you've gone public against it as a Christian.
[00:43:35.803 --> 00:43:39.269]  At the end of the day, is not the world cult a group of spiritual vampires?
[00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:40.050]  Absolutely.
[00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.674]  Spiritual and energetic vampires.
[00:43:42.754 --> 00:43:50.425]  We really need Alex to support Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who has made this bold move with this 11-page
[00:43:51.707 --> 00:43:51.887]  Yeah.
[00:44:11.486 --> 00:44:16.348]  Evidently and obviously corrupted by pedophilia left, right and center.
[00:44:16.668 --> 00:44:17.809]  And Pope Francis knew it.
[00:44:17.889 --> 00:44:24.372]  Now, it's the first time, Alex, that the Pope got actually cornered on the plane coming back from Dublin.
[00:44:24.412 --> 00:44:29.594]  He said, well, I have read the accusations of Carol Maria Viganò.
[00:44:31.193 --> 00:44:33.995]  You make your own decisions about it.
[00:44:34.915 --> 00:44:36.636]  I will not say anything more.
[00:44:37.076 --> 00:44:39.497]  Now, this is a very unusual statement.
[00:44:40.418 --> 00:44:44.200]  He was actually admitting that the accusation is true.
[00:44:44.907 --> 00:44:48.169]  But then he invited the journalists to make their own decision.
[00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:53.472]  Well, everybody here in Italy and around the world is demanding for the Pope's resignation.
[00:44:53.652 --> 00:45:00.176]  And this time, it's because of a direct involvement with a cover-up of a case of pedophilia.
[00:45:00.416 --> 00:45:06.240]  And of course, they wanted us off the major social networks.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.962]  They wanted us censored before all this was coming out into light.
[00:45:10.522 --> 00:45:19.604]  And that's why they want to get Donald J. Trump out of the way and they want to impeach him with all this rubbish and Mueller and all this investigation.
[00:45:19.624 --> 00:45:20.744]  Let's get to the bottom line.
[00:45:20.764 --> 00:45:22.965]  Do you think the Pope is about to resign A and B?
[00:45:23.485 --> 00:45:32.427]  Explain to people how these pedophile networks work because if you're talking 301 priests in Pennsylvania, that's most of the priests admitting they were raping little kids.
[00:45:32.487 --> 00:45:37.948]  I mean, that means chances are if you're looking at five Catholic priests, two or three of them are pedophiles now.
[00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:48.977]  The Vatican has definitely been at the highest level of this global pedophile network, that now Donald J. Trump is really busting and fighting in an unprecedented way.
[00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:58.064]  So we are happy what is going on, because Trump is forcing the Catholic Church in a corner now, and the Pope might even resign.
[00:45:58.524 --> 00:46:06.125]  Clearly, this is a sign of a deep state war that from Brazil to the US to Italy to Australia, they're busting these people and we said that would happen.
[00:46:06.345 --> 00:46:07.386]  That's what my sources said.
[00:46:07.466 --> 00:46:10.786]  Trump and others, also patriots in Europe, are moving against this network.
[00:46:10.946 --> 00:46:14.127]  We have even nuns now that got arrested.
[00:46:14.427 --> 00:46:26.489]  Even a 93-year-old nun in Scotland is investigated because of molesting children and making them eat their own vomit and participating to satanic rituals with nuns.
[00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:29.111]  This is happening in Scotland just now.
[00:46:29.491 --> 00:46:34.474]  So it's not only happening with priests or with cardinals, bishops, it's happening also with nuns.
[00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:35.535]  This is the key.
[00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:38.597]  Hiding in plain view in the Pennsylvania Papers, and the indictment is.
[00:46:39.098 --> 00:46:41.760]  And then they'd make them read out of the Bible while they had sex with them.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.542]  Then they'd do this with crosses, then they'd do that with blood.
[00:46:44.862 --> 00:46:49.285]  They're doing satanic rituals in pentagrams in the church.
[00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:51.526]  This is what satanists do.
[00:46:51.867 --> 00:46:53.148]  It's called blasphemy.
[00:46:53.468 --> 00:46:55.709]  And the satanists have taken over the Catholic Church.
[00:47:06.373 --> 00:47:10.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:23.587]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I
[00:47:30.749 --> 00:47:31.830]  We're in a war.
[00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:35.574]  We're in an information war, and we're all in it together.
[00:47:35.594 --> 00:47:42.900]  And I need your help, because InfoWars has been silenced off of every big tech platform so that mainstream corporate media can lynch me.
[00:47:43.981 --> 00:47:44.622]  Electronically.
[00:47:45.303 --> 00:47:50.707]  So that they can have the number one propaganda outfit working with Facebook, produced by Snapchat, now this.
[00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:59.555]  And others daily put out huge hoax lies about me to be pushed to the audiences there.
[00:48:00.696 --> 00:48:13.245]  And if you just tuned in, we broke down where these racist Hispanic ladies run over to me to get in my face.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:20.104]  And say that I am a subhuman, inbred, white, cave dweller, just like the New York Times writer says.
[00:48:20.524 --> 00:48:22.786]  And that my parents are inbred scum, and I'm a monkey.
[00:48:23.326 --> 00:48:24.747]  And I say, how dare you, racist!
[00:48:25.968 --> 00:48:29.850]  And so, now this, and Facebook, edited it, put it out to defame me.
[00:48:33.873 --> 00:48:39.377]  To legitimize their banning of InfoWars, and now every other major conservative we know, and the major election meddling.
[00:48:40.277 --> 00:48:42.459]  The President's getting ready to take action with executive orders.
[00:48:43.919 --> 00:48:53.929]  It's time all of us take action by getting this video out to folks so they see the truth of these horrible, horrible racists that were funded clearly at these hearings by Soros.
[00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.632]  So many people that were there attacking us, not just these women.
[00:48:58.513 --> 00:49:02.217]  Did you go attack Kavanaugh, myself, you name it, and then they edit it and they lie.
[00:49:03.738 --> 00:49:08.423]  Just, is there any justice in the universe against organizations like NowThis News?
[00:49:09.735 --> 00:49:14.017]  Who's allowed to be on Facebook and everywhere else, but I'm silenced there, so I can't respond.
[00:49:14.037 --> 00:49:15.538]  Well, they can't stop you getting this video.
[00:49:16.178 --> 00:49:19.179]  Or they can't stop you getting the raw videos and pointing out the lies.
[00:49:19.279 --> 00:49:20.740]  We have to stand up against these people.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.700]  They're authoritarians.
[00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:28.023]  Now, the good news is people are waking up.
[00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.111]  And what I'm about to show you is so powerful.
[00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:39.894]  The full video is on Infowars.com, in an article, White House Economist Proves Trump Reversed Obama's Disastrous Economic Policies.
[00:49:40.915 --> 00:49:46.397]  And on the election day of November 8th, everything goes straight up in all these graphs.
[00:49:47.678 --> 00:49:52.179]  Because they'd artificially, under globalism, set it up to drive down the U.S.
[00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:54.760]  economy and transfer our wealth under U.N.
[00:49:55.021 --> 00:49:55.321]  treaty.
[00:49:56.175 --> 00:50:01.157]  And so Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Kevin Hassett, sets the record straight.
[00:50:01.557 --> 00:50:04.118]  This is powerful for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[00:50:04.538 --> 00:50:08.639]  Again, they have a red line on the election day, and people knowing America's open for business.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.180]  Under treaty, it wasn't.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.721]  He'd been strategically sabotaged.
[00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:14.901]  And so that's why every graph goes straight up.
[00:50:15.222 --> 00:50:16.222]  Here is the report.
[00:50:18.855 --> 00:50:34.856]  Since we're the nerds at the White House, we decided that this is a testable hypothesis, and so that what we can do is we can go out and we can estimate recent trends, that is trends that ran in the economy up to the point of the last election, and then compare the latest data to the recent trends.
[00:50:35.776 --> 00:50:42.701]  In most cases, by the way, the estimates of the trends that we present to you here are very statistically significant, as are the deviations from the trend.
[00:50:43.081 --> 00:50:46.163]  And so I'm not going to, as I always do, show you a few slides.
[00:50:46.223 --> 00:50:47.304]  Could I have the next slide, please?
[00:50:47.964 --> 00:50:49.025]  That's the first slide again.
[00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.066]  There we go.
[00:50:50.946 --> 00:50:53.787]  So the first slide that we're looking at is small business optimism.
[00:50:54.608 --> 00:51:00.350]  And this is basically, for parallel construction, you're going to see that each of the slides we go through is going to look a lot like this.
[00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:09.653]  And so the blue part to the left of the slide is what happened from the 2012 election through the 2016 election.
[00:51:10.394 --> 00:51:15.856]  And the dotted blue line is the trend that President Trump inherited from the previous president.
[00:51:16.336 --> 00:51:18.897]  And the red line is what actually happened with the data.
[00:51:19.857 --> 00:51:24.399]  And so I think that if you look at this chart, you can see that the first thing is small business optimism.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.381]  The middle chart is the percent reporting now is a good time to expand.
[00:51:28.882 --> 00:51:32.283]  The last one is the percent expecting higher real sales in six months.
[00:51:32.783 --> 00:51:37.986]  I think if you look at any of those, you'd say, geez, that doesn't really look like the continuation of a recent trend.
[00:51:38.006 --> 00:51:39.887]  Could I have the next slide, please?
[00:51:42.202 --> 00:51:48.248]  The next chart is something that in my first presser here, way back last fall, we talked a lot about.
[00:51:49.329 --> 00:51:53.834]  It's business investment, which is more than $300 billion over the trend.
[00:51:53.914 --> 00:52:03.565]  Again, if you look at the blue line on the left, the first chart is non-residential fixed investment, and the dotted line is the trend and the growth rate of that, that President Trump inherited.
[00:52:04.726 --> 00:52:11.810]  The middle chart is structures, or buildings, and that, as you can see, the dotted line, is something that's headed straight down.
[00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:17.713]  And then the final chart is equipment investment, and that went straight down before President Trump was elected.
[00:52:18.233 --> 00:52:31.922]  And I think that if anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we're seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited, then, well, you know, they wouldn't get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion.
[00:52:33.143 --> 00:52:33.944]  The next chart please.
[00:52:36.247 --> 00:52:45.939]  Durable goods orders, capital goods orders, it's a key part of the economy and it's one of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes basically the good paying jobs.
[00:52:48.908 --> 00:52:50.449]  If you're a radio listener, that's wonderful.
[00:52:50.489 --> 00:52:52.270]  Please tell everybody about the local station you're listening to.
[00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:56.812]  Everyone has to go to InfoWars.com.
[00:52:57.192 --> 00:53:03.176]  I've been kicked off everything, except our hundreds of radio stations and TV stations, and we're literally getting five, six...
[00:53:04.076 --> 00:53:05.317]  Great stations a week right now.
[00:53:05.677 --> 00:53:06.217]  Big ones!
[00:53:06.877 --> 00:53:10.039]  About to cut liners for 20-something stations we got the last two weeks.
[00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:12.219]  They've just got to send us the exact liners they want.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:22.304]  We're on huge stations in Fresno, California and there's some of the California ones and their capital.
[00:53:23.408 --> 00:53:24.088]  Uh, as well.
[00:53:24.849 --> 00:53:27.210]  So, a lot of amazing things.
[00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:28.391]  Sacramento, you name it.
[00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:29.532]  It's all over the country.
[00:53:29.632 --> 00:53:33.254]  The biggest stations are picking us up now because they get what's happening.
[00:53:33.914 --> 00:53:36.096]  So this is blown up in the globalist's face to a great extent.
[00:53:37.777 --> 00:53:44.481]  But, just like they want to sabotage the economy, and just like Bill Maher says he wants a depression to teach people that Trump's bad, it's still a war.
[00:53:45.731 --> 00:53:51.253]  And so if you're a radio listener, you've got to go to Infowars.com to see this 9-minute video with the graphs.
[00:53:51.353 --> 00:53:58.915]  I mean, you see a jump of about 7-8% when he's president-elect.
[00:53:58.955 --> 00:54:00.096]  Just, wow, okay.
[00:54:00.436 --> 00:54:02.977]  And then as soon as he gets in and starts delivering, it goes straight up.
[00:54:03.277 --> 00:54:05.357]  So every graph goes bloop, bloop, boom!
[00:54:05.377 --> 00:54:06.958]  Bloop, bloop, boom!
[00:54:08.302 --> 00:54:08.642]  Boom!
[00:54:09.082 --> 00:54:13.765]  And it kind of goes up and then down a little because people thought he wasn't going to get inaugurated because the Democrats said he wouldn't.
[00:54:13.985 --> 00:54:16.567]  So it goes bloop, down some, and then boom!
[00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:19.748]  Bloop, bloop, boom!
[00:54:20.028 --> 00:54:20.949]  Bloop, bloop, boom!
[00:54:21.409 --> 00:54:23.070]  I mean, you've got to see this as a radio listener.
[00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.391]  This is so important!
[00:54:25.271 --> 00:54:28.253]  And then Obama gets out there and lies and takes credit for all of it.
[00:54:28.393 --> 00:54:29.674]  It is insane!
[00:54:31.736 --> 00:54:34.077]  I mean, I looked at all the graphs and basically drew this out.
[00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:35.898]  This is Obama going straight down.
[00:54:36.178 --> 00:54:36.438]  Boom.
[00:54:36.458 --> 00:54:37.118]  Trump gets elected.
[00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:43.561]  Some of the things are like... Straight up.
[00:54:45.061 --> 00:54:46.262]  Straight up!
[00:54:46.842 --> 00:54:49.943]  Because America was being held under... What did I tell you?
[00:54:50.003 --> 00:54:51.824]  It's in the UNESCO documents.
[00:54:52.604 --> 00:54:55.105]  He hasn't even gotten 10% control yet.
[00:54:55.805 --> 00:54:57.646]  And they can't even hold America down.
[00:54:57.886 --> 00:55:00.027]  You think the spirit of America wanted to be held down by these jerks?
[00:55:01.707 --> 00:55:03.228]  And just getting them off us a little.
[00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:05.648]  Straight up!
[00:55:05.668 --> 00:55:06.889]  Let's go back to the video.
[00:55:08.369 --> 00:55:18.112]  Durable goods orders, capital goods orders, it's a key part of the economy and it's one of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes basically the good-paying jobs.
[00:55:18.933 --> 00:55:22.374]  The jobs that affects normal Americans, blue-collar Americans.
[00:55:23.314 --> 00:55:25.595]  And the first chart is core capital goods orders.
[00:55:26.395 --> 00:55:28.956]  Uh, and the second chart is core capital goods shipments.
[00:55:29.737 --> 00:55:35.819]  Uh, and if you look at it, the blue again shows a clear downward trajectory, uh, in billions of dollars.
[00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:40.982]  Uh, and then that trajectory reversed itself completely when President Trump was elected.
[00:55:41.022 --> 00:55:43.503]  If you were going to assert... Hey, boss, back it up for 20 seconds.
[00:55:45.503 --> 00:55:46.524]  This is why I get so angry.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.582]  Obama was artificially suppressing the economy.
[00:55:51.303 --> 00:55:58.429]  And people go, well wait, the Federal Reserve printed $5.5 trillion for him, none for Trump, and they've done six interest rate rates to try to stop Trump.
[00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:03.194]  Because that $5.5 trillion did not go to the American people.
[00:56:04.195 --> 00:56:09.680]  The big banks had 0% lending to themselves, but they had record interest rates for real lending.
[00:56:11.257 --> 00:56:16.541]  For things like credit cards, and they got rid of loan sharking laws all over the country so you could have payday loans.
[00:56:17.402 --> 00:56:22.566]  The globalists were giving themselves trillions of dollars for Chinese investment.
[00:56:23.484 --> 00:56:28.646]  And Trump's looking at this going, uh-uh, no, you let me in, I'll untie the boat from the dock.
[00:56:28.906 --> 00:56:30.586]  You ever pulled out when you're getting gas?
[00:56:30.646 --> 00:56:31.146]  I got a boat.
[00:56:31.186 --> 00:56:31.747]  Anybody got a boat?
[00:56:32.327 --> 00:56:34.568]  And you're trying to pull out, whoa, almost pulled the dock off.
[00:56:34.888 --> 00:56:36.128]  Let me, oh, I forgot a rope.
[00:56:36.168 --> 00:56:38.269]  Hey, why didn't you untie that rope, son?
[00:56:39.269 --> 00:56:40.649]  Told my son, untie the rope, son, we're leaving.
[00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:42.930]  Son, did you see the rope?
[00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.631]  Trump just went, untie the rope?
[00:56:46.771 --> 00:56:47.952]  We're gonna come back and play the rest of it.
[00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:55.877]  Amazing, ladies and gentlemen, that we're going straight down, and now we go straight up, and then Obama has the nerve saying we never get to 3%.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.540]  It's impossible.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.662]  In fact, I have the Krugman clip I keep me in to play.
[00:57:03.682 --> 00:57:04.562]  Can you guys go grab that?
[00:57:05.363 --> 00:57:06.824]  Where he said it's impossible.
[00:57:06.844 --> 00:57:08.404]  He said there's no way to go above 3%.
[00:57:08.565 --> 00:57:09.225]  We have the video.
[00:57:10.406 --> 00:57:12.627]  And then now, Krugman's taking credit himself!
[00:57:13.328 --> 00:57:14.909]  He said, it's impossible!
[00:57:15.629 --> 00:57:18.110]  And that's Obama's main economic advisor!
[00:57:19.187 --> 00:57:24.178]  And now Obama swaggers around going, huh, it was as good under me as it is now, and it's all because of me!
[00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:25.501]  You are a liar!
[00:57:27.193 --> 00:57:28.094]  We're in an economic war.
[00:57:28.294 --> 00:57:29.415]  Amazon's banning books.
[00:57:29.435 --> 00:57:30.656]  They're coming after our shopping carts.
[00:57:30.676 --> 00:57:31.577]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:57:31.597 --> 00:57:32.578]  We're running out of X2.
[00:57:32.618 --> 00:57:34.099]  We can't get the supplies of it anymore.
[00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:35.560]  We got the last run of it right now.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.821]  Still discounted 25%.
[00:57:37.122 --> 00:57:37.702]  It's amazing.
[00:57:37.742 --> 00:57:39.584]  Find out the power of Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.

[00:57:42.586 --> 00:57:44.288]  We're in it to win it.
[00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:45.869]  We're never going to surrender.
[00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.691]  We're at full ramming speed.
[00:57:48.151 --> 00:57:49.813]  But we need your prayers and support.
[00:57:50.373 --> 00:57:50.974]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:52.879 --> 00:58:04.791]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[00:58:05.331 --> 00:58:11.617]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[00:58:12.358 --> 00:58:18.702]  To begin shutting down conservatives, or the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[00:58:18.922 --> 00:58:25.245]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[00:58:25.525 --> 00:58:30.288]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[00:58:30.628 --> 00:58:32.269]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure.
[00:58:32.289 --> 00:58:32.910]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:35.871]  But every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:38.733]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[00:58:39.233 --> 00:58:40.294]  Obama established...
[00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:44.295]  With an executive order, a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[00:58:44.635 --> 00:58:48.777]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist popular groups.
[00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:58.921]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:06.544]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[00:59:06.984 --> 00:59:21.517]  Just like communist China, this is dangerous authoritarianism, and they've packaged silencing Americans who are popular and well-spoken, as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News, not because what I say is bad, but because what I say is effective and true and popular.
[00:59:21.777 --> 00:59:30.585]  But I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has bit off more than it can chew, and what you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more.
[00:59:30.845 --> 00:59:31.385]  But I'll say this.
[00:59:31.645 --> 00:59:33.987]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media.
[00:59:34.307 --> 00:59:44.012]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:59:55.054 --> 00:59:59.167]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.689 --> 01:00:00.993]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:35.672]  So, we have the Chairman of the Economic Council of Advisors, Kevin Hassett, in a nine-minute video we're going to finish up right now, destroying Obama's lies.
[01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:44.876]  I mean, the White House economist destroys, with these graphs, Obama's lies, taking credit for the economic recovery, which again,
[01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:58.127]  They had shut down the general economy, shut down real factories, shut down real local corporations and real local power, and only had insider big banks, insider big operations getting the trillions of U.S.
[01:00:58.167 --> 01:01:03.590]  taxpayer money that the Federal Reserve was putting out, that we had to pay for, to transfer wealth to China.
[01:01:03.851 --> 01:01:05.191]  It's a military operation.
[01:01:06.332 --> 01:01:07.893]  Trump came in and said, we're out of TPP.
[01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:09.374]  We're not putting up with China anymore.
[01:01:09.675 --> 01:01:10.815]  We're bringing investment back here.
[01:01:10.855 --> 01:01:11.196]  It's over.
[01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:15.591]  And that's why they're flipping out, because we were taken over by economic warfare.
[01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:16.432]  Let's continue.
[01:01:17.493 --> 01:01:27.239]  Durable goods orders, capital goods orders, it's a key part of the economy and it's one of the factors that we look at most closely because it characterizes basically the good-paying jobs.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.522]  The jobs that affects normal Americans, blue-collar Americans.
[01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:34.725]  And the first chart is core capital goods orders.
[01:01:35.805 --> 01:01:38.087]  And the second chart is core capital goods shipments.
[01:01:39.008 --> 01:01:44.933]  And if you look at it, the blue again shows a clear downward trajectory in billions of dollars.
[01:01:45.694 --> 01:01:50.098]  And that trajectory reversed itself completely when President Trump was elected.
[01:01:50.138 --> 01:01:58.325]  If you were going to assert that the current good news is just the extension of a recent trend, then you'd just simply be factually incorrect.
[01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:01.387]  The next slide, please.
[01:02:02.568 --> 01:02:13.574]  Here we're looking at the ISM Purchasing Managers Index, which is a survey of people who are purchasing managers for manufacturing firms.
[01:02:14.074 --> 01:02:18.276]  And so they're the folks that, you know, as the title suggests, manage the purchases.
[01:02:18.856 --> 01:02:24.299]  And so it's a really great indicator of the economy because you could survey them and say, hey, have you been buying lots of stuff this month?
[01:02:24.819 --> 01:02:25.299]  Or have you not?
[01:02:25.719 --> 01:02:29.481]  And the index shows what their responses look like.
[01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:36.063]  And you can see that the trend on the purchasing manager's index was pretty much flat when President Trump took office.
[01:02:36.443 --> 01:02:38.884]  And the red line shows you what happened since.
[01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:45.466]  There's a clear inflection right at the election and a clear break trend.
[01:02:47.216 --> 01:02:48.377]  Let's turn to the next one, please.
[01:02:49.157 --> 01:02:58.502]  Now, one of the things that I remember at the American Enterprise Institute talking a lot about before I came in here was the fact that entrepreneurship in America was falling off.
[01:02:59.062 --> 01:03:08.027]  And one of the ways we can measure entrepreneurship is that if you start a new business, that you have to apply for an ID number, a tax ID number, for your business.
[01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:14.790]  And so in this chart, we've plotted the EIN applications for new businesses.
[01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:24.434]  And if you look at the blue line, they were heading up because we were at a recovery, but there's a clear upward trajectory way above the trend at the end.
[01:03:24.814 --> 01:03:29.696]  And, you know, Sarah, like John Roberts, is a calculus geek.
[01:03:29.736 --> 01:03:34.278]  And so she looked at that one and said, geez, that looks like a very strong second derivative to me.
[01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:39.605]  And then I said, I didn't know you did calculus, and she said, I like calculus better than talking to these guys.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.222]  The next chart is prime-age workers re-entering the labor force.
[01:03:45.902 --> 01:04:04.169]  And again, if you look at the trend, one of the things people said when we put out our growth forecast and said that we'd have 3% growth was we said that President Trump's policies are going to bring factories back to the U.S., give you the capital spending boom that you saw in the previous chart, and that was going to bring people back into the labor force at precisely the right time.
[01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:08.071]  Once again, you can see that there's a clear break of the trend.
[01:04:09.689 --> 01:04:16.687]  And so if you see a break of the trend in the capital spending, the new plant formation that gives blue-collar workers their jobs...
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.944]  Then maybe we see a break of the trend in blue-collar workers employment as well.
[01:04:23.664 --> 01:04:26.928]  And so this is employment for people in goods-producing industries.
[01:04:27.389 --> 01:04:34.797]  If you look again at the blue part on the left, you can see that there's a clear downward trend going on in the growth rate of that for President Obama.
[01:04:35.218 --> 01:04:39.502]  And then a clear inflection, timed almost precisely once again at the election.
[01:04:40.223 --> 01:04:49.706]  And the notion, again, that somebody might defensively attempt to assert that this is a continuation of a trend is almost laughable if you look at this chart and, you know, look at the rest of it.
[01:04:51.206 --> 01:05:00.068]  Folks, we'll be right back with the conclusion of this and then the latest on the hurricane that's pointed right at major nuclear reactors, ten of them.
[01:05:00.388 --> 01:05:02.049]  We'll look at all of that straight ahead.
[01:05:05.504 --> 01:05:11.486]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[01:05:11.906 --> 01:05:12.786]  And I want to thank you all.
[01:05:12.866 --> 01:05:13.827]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[01:05:13.847 --> 01:05:15.627]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[01:05:15.687 --> 01:05:21.969]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.350]  And we've got products that help you.
[01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:27.511]  I mean, even mainstream media admits, they have to, that fish oil is the best thing out there.
[01:05:27.551 --> 01:05:28.772]  But you want pure fish oil.
[01:05:28.852 --> 01:05:30.232]  You want the mercury removed.
[01:05:30.372 --> 01:05:32.693]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[01:05:32.773 --> 01:05:40.675]  The best krill oil, the best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic, salmon, and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids, the honor roll.
[01:05:40.695 --> 01:05:41.315]  Three different types.
[01:05:41.335 --> 01:05:42.275]  You cannot do better.
[01:05:42.335 --> 01:05:42.935]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:43.195 --> 01:05:45.456]  Help the brain, help the body, help the heart, help the InfoWars.
[01:05:45.516 --> 01:05:46.296]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[01:05:46.396 --> 01:05:48.696]  And then we've got Ultimate Turmeric Formula, about to sell out bodies.
[01:05:48.776 --> 01:05:49.537]  That's 50% off.
[01:05:49.637 --> 01:05:50.637]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut.
[01:05:50.657 --> 01:05:51.517]  That's special this week.
[01:05:51.637 --> 01:05:53.438]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:53.538 --> 01:05:59.219]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[01:05:59.539 --> 01:05:59.959]  I need it!
[01:06:08.874 --> 01:06:13.802]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.503]  We are now 17 years after the tragic event that took 3,000 American lives.
[01:06:44.563 --> 01:06:51.429]  Thousands more died from the deadly dust that Bush and the Democrats with him covered up.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.460]  We've got Mike Adams joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:06:55.161 --> 01:07:03.583]  The major regulatory agencies, Department of Energy and others, are saying that 10 major plants are in the way of the new hurricane.
[01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:09.964]  We're going to be looking at all of that and the serious devastation of a Cat 6 Florence set to make landfall in the next few days.
[01:07:10.004 --> 01:07:10.884]  We pray it slows down.
[01:07:10.904 --> 01:07:12.685]  We're going to be looking at all that in a moment.
[01:07:13.513 --> 01:07:15.414]  But first, the economic 9-11.
[01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:23.899]  And I've been playing clips here of White House economist proves Trump reversed Obama's disastrous economic policies, Kevin Hassett.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:29.543]  And he's just showing chart after chart of right when Trump gets elected, the economy starts going up.
[01:07:30.103 --> 01:07:31.985]  Then the Democrats say, oh, we're not gonna let him get in office.
[01:07:32.005 --> 01:07:32.765]  So it starts dropping.
[01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:35.166]  And as soon as he gets inaugurated, straight up.
[01:07:36.247 --> 01:07:38.469]  So we're gonna go ahead and finish up with this important clip.
[01:07:38.509 --> 01:07:38.809]  Here it is.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:57.276]  On the final chart, you'll see that the black line is in June of 2017, what the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan agency that has a job really of looking at recent trends and projecting it, what they said would happen to capital spending back in 2017.
[01:07:57.316 --> 01:08:04.763]  The blue line is what they said in April 2018, and the red line is what's actually happened.
[01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:16.165]  And so, I would assert that if you look at the collective body of evidence, the notion that what we're seeing right now is just a continuation of recent trends, it's not super defensible.
[01:08:16.726 --> 01:08:28.591]  And I think that, I know that we're in a political time and passions are high, but as geeky economists, one of the things we have to do is think ahead to, you know, what historians will think when they look back at this time.
[01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:40.284]  And I can promise you that economic historians will 100% accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump and that a whole bunch of data items started headed north.
[01:08:41.145 --> 01:08:45.670]  They will, of course, argue for a long time about why that happened.
[01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:50.155]  But my final thought for you is just this, that when they do that,
[01:08:50.755 --> 01:08:57.778]  And when you watch people do that in the media going forward with op-eds and so on, that you should watch out for ex post theorizing.
[01:08:58.198 --> 01:09:01.419]  As an economist, one of the things I most care about is an ex ante theory.
[01:09:01.459 --> 01:09:05.200]  Something that happens before and then let's watch the data and then see if it agrees with the theory.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.721]  That's how you test the theory.
[01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:12.703]  You might recall that I came back here last fall and I told you that if we had the tax cuts
[01:09:13.123 --> 01:09:16.445]  The President Trump advised that we have, that he pursued.
[01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.806]  If we pass them, then there'd be a boom in capital spending this year.
[01:09:20.767 --> 01:09:30.091]  In fact, we provided estimates at the time last fall that said the capital spending this year would go up about 11% because of the tax cuts.
[01:09:30.911 --> 01:09:33.412]  So far in the first half of the year, capital spending is up 10%.
[01:09:34.833 --> 01:09:37.614]  And so you don't have to really reach far for a theory of what happened.
[01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:40.035]  President Trump deregulated the economy.
[01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.555]  We've talked about how that affects growth.
[01:09:41.835 --> 01:09:44.736]  The tax cuts have had exactly the predicted effect on the economy.
[01:09:45.116 --> 01:09:51.138]  That's brought businesses back to the U.S., factories back to the U.S., and created jobs for ordinary Americans.
[01:09:51.618 --> 01:09:53.459]  It's clear in the data that there's been a trend break.
[01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:56.884]  So that is the good news.
[01:09:56.944 --> 01:10:07.128]  The trend break is artificially the globalists who are driving down the West, de-industrializing us, shutting off our jobs and industry to authoritarian China to dominate the globe.
[01:10:08.169 --> 01:10:10.150]  And now we know that Google and Apple have moved to China.
[01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:12.971]  They won't even work with the Pentagon, but they'll work with the Chinese military.
[01:10:14.072 --> 01:10:14.692]  These are U.S.
[01:10:14.732 --> 01:10:15.812]  companies started with U.S.
[01:10:15.993 --> 01:10:16.673]  DARPA funding.
[01:10:17.799 --> 01:10:19.460]  And they're working against everybody.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.322]  And now Amazon's banning books of conservatives.
[01:10:23.323 --> 01:10:24.964]  They are testing and probing.
[01:10:25.004 --> 01:10:29.548]  And I'm told from White House sources that Trump has a mutiny going on that's now admitted.
[01:10:30.128 --> 01:10:39.936]  We first told you about that a year ago, but that he's trying to get executive orders done right now against Google, against Facebook, against Twitter, you name it.
[01:10:40.716 --> 01:10:45.360]  But the ignorance of the senators in those hearings has only green-lighted
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:11:04.773]  The hubris we're seeing, and there's more news out today about internal emails of Google telling people to give illegal campaign contributions, how to get illegal aliens to vote, you name it, to go out and tell their employees, you better get your Hispanic folks to vote for Hillary.
[01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:10.158]  This is what they do, and they couldn't deliver the election like they thought, so now they're openly censoring to do it.
[01:11:11.581 --> 01:11:18.065]  The good news is, with just Trump getting partial control of the government back, and changing the policy that's anti-American, things are coming back.
[01:11:18.305 --> 01:11:19.546]  You can't hold back America.
[01:11:20.346 --> 01:11:22.468]  Even on our deathbed, we've come back from the dead like the Phoenix.
[01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:28.491]  The bad news is, we have a hurricane that they say is accelerating to a cat six.
[01:11:28.971 --> 01:11:33.894]  Hurricane Florence nears Carolinas, forcing westward exodus of millions of people.
[01:11:34.435 --> 01:11:37.857]  What happens to North Carolina's wild horses when a major hurricane like Florence hits?
[01:11:39.144 --> 01:11:41.685]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:11:41.705 --> 01:11:46.507]  Hurricane risk including toxic sludge and lagoons of pigment are flowing out to the ocean.
[01:11:46.847 --> 01:11:49.608]  Millions prepare for potentially catastrophic Florence.
[01:11:50.128 --> 01:11:53.369]  Hurricane Florence could be the worst storm ever to hit North Carolina.
[01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.050]  North of Florida.
[01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.391]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:11:58.671 --> 01:12:00.972]  Expect 15-20 foot storm surge.
[01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:02.473]  But here's the big news.
[01:12:03.273 --> 01:12:04.774]  And there's a little blurb on this.
[01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:16.441]  That was in several other publications, just where the federal government, the Department of Energy, and others, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had said that it could hit 10 power plants.
[01:12:16.461 --> 01:12:19.783]  Well, Mike Adams actually went to their website at naturalnews.com.
[01:12:20.064 --> 01:12:21.925]  We're posting this at infowars.com as well.
[01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:26.628]  Fukushima in America, 12 nuclear power plants are in the path of Hurricane Florence.
[01:12:27.068 --> 01:12:30.150]  Flooding, storm surge threaten cooling operations.
[01:12:30.771 --> 01:12:34.513]  Could we have, with our aging plants, a Fukushima-type scenario?
[01:12:34.693 --> 01:12:35.414]  I hope not.
[01:12:36.215 --> 01:12:37.137]  But this is a Cat 6.
[01:12:37.658 --> 01:12:40.926]  It could certainly, if it direct hits plants, cause some problems.
[01:12:40.986 --> 01:12:43.191]  And Mike Adams, an engineer, is here to break it down.
[01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:44.173]  Mike, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:12:45.888 --> 01:12:48.310]  Thanks for having me on, Alex, and I agree with you.
[01:12:48.451 --> 01:13:01.703]  We pray that this scenario doesn't unfold, but we were promised by General Electric that it wouldn't happen in Fukushima, and it's also General Electric that built the exact same power plant, the Brunswick power plants.
[01:13:01.723 --> 01:13:05.266]  There's two units that are active right now that are right near the ocean.
[01:13:05.306 --> 01:13:06.427]  You can go to the U.S.
[01:13:06.487 --> 01:13:08.269]  Nuclear Regulatory Commission website
[01:13:08.869 --> 01:13:11.833]  And you can see their map, which we've published in the story there.
[01:13:11.853 --> 01:13:13.054]  You're welcome to use all those images.
[01:13:13.835 --> 01:13:21.564]  It shows two operating live power plants right there that are what's called boiler water reactors, or BWRs.
[01:13:21.604 --> 01:13:22.284]  They were built in the 1970s.
[01:13:23.886 --> 01:13:28.987]  And this is virtually identical to the same kind of structure that Fukushima power plants used.
[01:13:29.387 --> 01:13:47.092]  And if you recall, Fukushima, what happened was that a storm surge from an underground earthquake caused a massive wave of ocean water to come in and inundate that power plant, which overwhelmed the diesel generators and the backup battery power supplies, which caused the cooling operations to fail.
[01:13:47.752 --> 01:13:57.220]  This led to a meltdown, and I will mention, by the way, you'll remember this Alex, that the entire mainstream media at the time lied and said there wasn't a meltdown.
[01:13:57.281 --> 01:13:58.442]  They denied it for years.
[01:13:58.502 --> 01:14:00.723]  Now they report it as if everybody always knew it.
[01:14:00.784 --> 01:14:04.567]  I mean, talk about the lying media, but whatever.
[01:14:04.587 --> 01:14:08.250]  A meltdown scenario is a worst-case scenario.
[01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:09.811]  We hope it doesn't happen.
[01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:10.232]  There's no
[01:14:11.258 --> 01:14:27.224]  I can't say there's any evidence right now that the nuclear power facility operators are anticipating such an outcome, but we've learned from history that we are lied to constantly, including by nuclear power plant operators and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
[01:14:27.244 --> 01:14:28.684]  We're lied to about radiation levels.
[01:14:28.704 --> 01:14:29.905]  We're lied to about the meltdowns.
[01:14:30.325 --> 01:14:35.327]  So of course we have honest skepticism about the readiness of these power plants.
[01:14:35.367 --> 01:14:35.907]  Now granted,
[01:14:36.859 --> 01:14:54.937]  If this were to go into some kind of a radiological release scenario, if the power failed, if the cooling pumps failed, and if there were a meltdown, we're talking the highly populated east coast of the United States, and depending on wind patterns, there could be a radiological release, theoretically.
[01:14:54.957 --> 01:15:00.323]  Well, we know the wind patterns are already north, and with a hurricane, it'll go straight up the east coast with a radioactive cloud.
[01:15:01.115 --> 01:15:06.637]  Right in Virginia, Washington D.C., New York City, and even as far as Boston, depending on wind conditions.
[01:15:06.657 --> 01:15:12.819]  And let's be clear, this General Electric plant is a 40-year-old design, a total piece of crap.
[01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:19.282]  It is the surge of the tsunami coming in, they're saying 15 to 20 foot surges here coming in, and so those swamp
[01:15:19.702 --> 01:15:28.372]  The generators and the electricity goes out as generators then it starts melting down and we have back in the 50s had one meltdown in California they covered up for 40 years.
[01:15:28.793 --> 01:15:39.485]  They didn't declassify that to what the early 1990s that thing blew up as big as Fukushima so that's my concern is these are rotting badly managed plants and we're gonna come back and talk about that we're hoping this doesn't happen but...
[01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:48.225]  Stories at naturalnews.com, Fukushima in America, 12 nuclear power plants are in the path of Hurricane Florence, flooding storm surge could threaten cooling operations.
[01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:58.613]  And hopefully putting attention on this won't make the executives who are, you know, flying around on their jumbo jets or whatever, not be cheap like they did with the whole, you know, BP explosion out in the ocean.
[01:15:58.874 --> 01:16:00.675]  Get extra people there now!
[01:16:05.339 --> 01:16:07.860]  Austria, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia.
[01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.890]  We're all moving on.
[01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.692]  Your regime has become more and more irrelevant.
[01:16:12.793 --> 01:16:17.937]  In London on Saturday, 20,000 people attended a rally to free political prisoner Tommy Robinson.
[01:16:18.478 --> 01:16:20.780]  And those 20,000 people supported Brexit.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.903]  In May, another 10,000 people marched in support of free speech.
[01:16:25.063 --> 01:16:26.705]  They too support Brexit.
[01:16:27.706 --> 01:16:29.687]  17.4 million people voted for Brexit.
[01:16:29.827 --> 01:16:31.168]  They still support Brexit.
[01:16:31.489 --> 01:16:35.011]  The majority of the people want the government to get on with Brexit.
[01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:45.380]  You people entertain UK Ramonas, the modern day devil, George Soros, a foreigner kicked out of his own country, an open borders billionaire who openly fights democracy.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.383]  He openly pays MEPs to dance to his tune.
[01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:50.145]  You're all suffering from DDD.
[01:16:50.446 --> 01:16:52.428]  Democracy Deficit Disorder.
[01:16:52.688 --> 01:16:57.194]  And that's why we're marching again in London on the 23rd of June.
[01:16:57.254 --> 01:16:58.916]  We want our country back.
[01:16:58.956 --> 01:17:00.097]  Don't cut me off.
[01:17:00.197 --> 01:17:01.639]  It's one minute to now.
[01:17:05.029 --> 01:17:08.290]  Can you listen, because I think we both speak English, so we can be very clear.
[01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:11.291]  What I was trying to do was help you communicate.
[01:17:11.591 --> 01:17:13.972]  You are going far too fast for the interpreter.
[01:17:13.992 --> 01:17:17.253]  Yeah, but do you know I'm not speaking to all of them in here.
[01:17:17.313 --> 01:17:19.414]  I'm speaking to the UK.
[01:17:19.474 --> 01:17:20.795]  I'm speaking to Mrs May.
[01:17:21.055 --> 01:17:23.336]  I wasn't sent here to talk to any of you.
[01:17:23.356 --> 01:17:26.817]  I was sent here to defend the British people!
[01:17:27.097 --> 01:17:29.418]  Can I just... Colleagues, please.
[01:17:31.724 --> 01:17:33.567]  Please, just a little bit of quiet, please.
[01:17:33.587 --> 01:17:34.629]  Most of you understand English.
[01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:36.592]  English is the language of the world.
[01:17:36.692 --> 01:17:40.398]  Janice Atkinson is an amazing member of the EU Parliament.
[01:17:40.478 --> 01:17:41.239]  It's ceremonial.
[01:17:42.219 --> 01:17:45.861]  But they voted a lot of things, and if the permanent bureaucracy likes it, they then go along with it.
[01:17:45.881 --> 01:17:56.805]  But more and more, they're shutting down the nationalist, patriot movements within it that are using the Parliament as a bully pulpit to expose the authoritarian nature of the EU that was actually hatched by Adolf Hitler.
[01:17:56.945 --> 01:18:05.949]  JaniceAtkinson.co.uk, people just joined us, the amazing footage of them silencing you and other nationalists just from your speech, saying, you speak to us, not to your country.
[01:18:06.429 --> 01:18:17.993]  Just next level and you tie that in with people trying to pull out all over Europe, you tie that in to the GDPR, you tie that in to Article 13, Article 11, that even leftist media says, ends free speech as we know it.
[01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.514]  I mean, they are really panicking.
[01:18:19.534 --> 01:18:20.794]  What's going on over there right now?
[01:18:20.954 --> 01:18:26.676]  You know, Alex, we might have got rid of Soviet communism, but we've really got Euro-communism.
[01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:29.617]  And it's alive and well with centralized state control.
[01:18:29.977 --> 01:18:32.738]  And no free speech is allowed unless it's a
[01:18:33.038 --> 01:18:42.345]  Approved by the dear leaders because actually we took the brick out of the wall for Brexit and what we've seen is that the edifice is now coming down.
[01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:48.669]  So across Poland, across Hungary, in Italy, in Austria, the people are revolting.
[01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:51.611]  They're actually voting in the populist leaders.
[01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:53.813]  So the equivalent of Brexit
[01:18:54.073 --> 01:18:54.753]  We're good to go.
[01:19:13.042 --> 01:19:13.722]  I think?
[01:19:32.807 --> 01:19:34.548]  But they're fighting for their real life.
[01:19:34.608 --> 01:19:40.571]  They're fighting for the ideal of this Europe that they've sent up with this centralised state control.
[01:19:40.932 --> 01:19:50.337]  And because the people are remolting all over the Europe, as you did in America with Trump, and you've got to get rid of Trudeau in Canada, you know, the edifice is falling down.
[01:19:50.657 --> 01:19:53.258]  So what they're trying to do is control our speech.
[01:19:53.659 --> 01:19:57.521]  But again, there's no free speech unless it's approved by the dear leaders.
[01:20:06.278 --> 01:20:09.039]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.144]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:41.327]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:48.830]  We know we've been knocked off most platforms 56 days out because the globalists are planning a coup against the president.
[01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:51.431]  They're on the news saying they want to remove him, 25th Amendment.
[01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:53.712]  They've got sleeper cells, the New York Times says.
[01:20:53.732 --> 01:20:55.832]  That's a quote inside the White House.
[01:20:56.753 --> 01:20:59.234]  We have that headline from Infowars.com a year and a half ago.
[01:21:00.734 --> 01:21:02.115]  We've got so much to break down.
[01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:11.031]  I love science, and I know if you run reactors right, and really on top of it, and build them in the right spot, it's a great power source, but it can still have problems.
[01:21:12.252 --> 01:21:23.904]  But you start building hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these, and they're not upkeeping them, and they're not caring, and letting them dilapidate, you get a Chernobyl, you get a Fukushima, you get a sodium reactor experiment.
[01:21:25.826 --> 01:21:31.495]  And again, NBC News, 1959, it blew up as big as Fukushima, radiated California.
[01:21:31.876 --> 01:21:34.119]  They believe it may have caused up to a million cancers.
[01:21:35.947 --> 01:21:37.088]  There's even a Wikipedia on it.
[01:21:37.808 --> 01:21:41.931]  And we blame the Russians, and I'm not a Russophile, I'm not a Russophobe either.
[01:21:41.951 --> 01:21:46.673]  Oh, they kind of played down Fukushima, or Chernobyl.
[01:21:47.014 --> 01:21:49.115]  They admitted it happened, the Japanese played it down.
[01:21:49.375 --> 01:21:50.796]  The point is, that's what they do.
[01:21:51.356 --> 01:21:56.880]  And I've seen international Atomic Energy Agency numbers that 90 plus percent of reactors are leaking.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.501]  The average age is like 41 years old now.
[01:22:01.152 --> 01:22:04.116]  So they should have been decommissioned in 25 years.
[01:22:05.017 --> 01:22:18.454]  So Mike Adams is here to talk about this because this is a Cat 4 accelerating in most models, weather underground, weather channel, to a Cat 6 at landfall, raging into the interior up to 500 miles before it goes to Cat 3.
[01:22:20.216 --> 01:22:25.200]  But generally, they turn up the coast and don't slow down much, and go down to Cat 5.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:30.024]  We're talking insane asylum surges of 15 to 20 feet.
[01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:32.186]  Those go in, knock out power.
[01:22:33.547 --> 01:22:39.091]  They go on diesel generators, but they don't have these generators on towers, just like Fukushima did.
[01:22:39.812 --> 01:22:41.313]  So we had a 20-foot tsunami come in.
[01:22:41.914 --> 01:22:43.435]  That knocks out the generators.
[01:22:45.618 --> 01:22:47.260]  And then the meltdown begins.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.304]  Mike Adams is an engineer, he's got the report on naturalnews.com.
[01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:54.389]  Fukushima and America, 12 nuclear power plants are on the path of Hurricane Florence.
[01:22:54.489 --> 01:22:56.311]  Flooding, storms, surge threatens cooling operations.
[01:22:56.672 --> 01:22:59.275]  You're going right off the federal government's own numbers here.
[01:22:59.295 --> 01:23:01.197]  The media tries to say we're fear-mongering.
[01:23:01.217 --> 01:23:01.958]  We're not fear-mongering.
[01:23:02.258 --> 01:23:04.681]  We want an emergency declared now by the president.
[01:23:05.464 --> 01:23:09.946]  Not just a normal emergency, but a specific emergency to put federal teams in, U.S.
[01:23:10.006 --> 01:23:11.407]  military, nuclear engineers.
[01:23:11.727 --> 01:23:14.129]  We need them swarming these 12 plants.
[01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:18.591]  Mike, you've got them all mapped out in your amazing, in-depth, you know, 15-page article.
[01:23:18.631 --> 01:23:20.492]  You pound it out in just a few hours.
[01:23:20.532 --> 01:23:21.072]  Great job.
[01:23:21.293 --> 01:23:22.873]  We're posting it to Infowars.com.
[01:23:23.014 --> 01:23:24.354]  Everybody's got to retweet this.
[01:23:24.774 --> 01:23:25.575]  It's so critical.
[01:23:26.916 --> 01:23:31.858]  Again, get into the threat and then what you think the solution is to this, because I don't want to just sit here and wait for another disaster.
[01:23:32.819 --> 01:23:33.459]  Let's talk about this.
[01:23:33.779 --> 01:23:34.900]  Let's talk straight science.
[01:23:35.419 --> 01:23:35.899]  I think
[01:23:54.494 --> 01:23:54.934]  We're good.
[01:24:20.075 --> 01:24:21.897]  Could impact that facility.
[01:24:22.317 --> 01:24:25.179]  A storm surge is what caused Fukushima to go into a meltdown.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.541]  And a storm surge is our concern here.
[01:24:27.821 --> 01:24:29.583]  We're not predicting that it will happen.
[01:24:29.943 --> 01:24:31.484]  We pray and hope it never happens.
[01:24:31.544 --> 01:24:38.770]  But we have a social responsibility here to put out a warning to local people that this is a possibility.
[01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:42.133]  And what happens in a meltdown is of course... I don't want to stop you.
[01:24:42.153 --> 01:24:44.154]  They just showed a photo of the Brunswick facility.
[01:24:44.295 --> 01:24:46.136]  It looks just like Fukushima.
[01:24:46.697 --> 01:24:48.318]  I guess because it is the same design.
[01:24:49.378 --> 01:24:51.059]  It's almost the identical design.
[01:24:51.099 --> 01:24:53.079]  Again, they're all boiler water reactors.
[01:24:53.419 --> 01:24:58.001]  And these reactors depend on a steady supply of electricity to run the coolant pumps.
[01:24:58.401 --> 01:25:04.323]  If the electricity is cut off, and the generators fail, and the batteries fail, then you go into a meltdown.
[01:25:04.343 --> 01:25:07.944]  Because the physics of the situation is you can't just turn off fuel rods.
[01:25:08.244 --> 01:25:11.085]  There's no light switch to stop the physics of fission.
[01:25:11.725 --> 01:25:13.787]  These reactions continue to go on.
[01:25:13.847 --> 01:25:16.169]  You know, I mean, we're talking physics and elements here.
[01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:18.330]  You can't just stop it because you hope it stops.
[01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:19.871]  And that's what happened in Fukushima.
[01:25:20.252 --> 01:25:25.636]  And if there is a meltdown, you're going to have a massive release of radioisotopes into the atmosphere.
[01:25:26.156 --> 01:25:31.600]  Now, there's a containment building, of course, in the United States, but what happened in Fukushima is there was an explosion.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:40.747]  I believe it was a hydrogen explosion that destroyed much of the containment facility, allowing the radioisotope... In fact, they confirmed it threw rods as far as three miles away.
[01:25:41.889 --> 01:25:42.549]  That's right, that's right.
[01:25:42.849 --> 01:25:46.831]  So in that case, you're going to be dealing with two isotopes in particular that are very hazardous.
[01:25:47.191 --> 01:25:50.812]  Number one is iodine-131, which is the most deadly.
[01:25:50.972 --> 01:25:54.554]  It has a very short half-life, so it irradiates quickly.
[01:25:54.894 --> 01:25:58.955]  It has a half-life of about eight days, or you could call it roughly one week.
[01:25:59.215 --> 01:26:01.236]  But by then, your thyroid is cooked dead.
[01:26:02.105 --> 01:26:02.586]  Absolutely.
[01:26:02.646 --> 01:26:11.716]  If you're getting iodine 131 in your body, you're going to be, depending on the amount of internal radiation exposure, you could easily die from that.
[01:26:11.976 --> 01:26:15.400]  People get it through consuming milk, water, and food.
[01:26:17.822 --> 01:26:23.985]  Well, I'm sorry, iodine does go to the thyroid and other glands throughout the body, including breast tissue and prostate tissue.
[01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:32.649]  So this is why the Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself advises people to have supplementary iodine, potassium iodide, on hand.
[01:26:32.749 --> 01:26:39.273]  They have handed this out in the past in cities where residents are close to nuclear power facilities.
[01:26:39.553 --> 01:26:44.655]  And secondly, you have cesium-137, which has a half-life of about 29 or 30 years, let's call it.
[01:26:46.949 --> 01:26:54.093]  It takes ten half-lives, Alex, ten half-lives for these isotopes to go down to what are considered zero levels.
[01:26:54.473 --> 01:27:04.679]  So if iodine-131 has a half-life of, let's say, one week, it takes ten weeks before it's really... So for ten weeks, you are exposed to this.
[01:27:04.779 --> 01:27:06.440]  In week one, you get a full dose.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.401]  In week two, you get half the dose.
[01:27:08.501 --> 01:27:11.382]  In week three, you get one-fourth the dose, and so on.
[01:27:11.642 --> 01:27:16.285]  And it goes down, at about ten weeks, it's called zero by most people who are nuclear scientists.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.042]  But this is the issue.
[01:27:18.403 --> 01:27:28.179]  And cesium, it's about 300 years before it's down to zero levels, which is why even in Chernobyl today, in the surrounding areas, you can't grow food.
[01:27:28.806 --> 01:27:32.808]  And there's no birds, there's no insects in the plume area.
[01:27:33.168 --> 01:27:36.710]  Now again, they say the storm surge was 25 to 30 feet Fukushima.
[01:27:37.451 --> 01:27:39.792]  This is 15 to 20 feet they're estimating.
[01:27:40.252 --> 01:27:44.375]  The problem is, as you said, the reactor is right up the river, only a few miles from the coast.
[01:27:44.975 --> 01:27:48.517]  We're talking about if 20 foot waves get into that, this is not good.
[01:27:49.628 --> 01:27:54.993]  And the other thing that we saw after Fukushima, of course, is iodine supplies were wiped out everywhere.
[01:27:55.513 --> 01:27:59.336]  I know that your store offers, I think, Survival Shield.
[01:27:59.737 --> 01:28:00.758]  I don't recall the exact name.
[01:28:00.778 --> 01:28:02.299]  Yeah, Survival Shield next Tuesday.
[01:28:02.339 --> 01:28:02.779]  Really good.
[01:28:02.979 --> 01:28:07.463]  I mean, obviously, I don't know if people can get it in time for this, but people can get Himalayan Salt, has it as well.
[01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:11.507]  The point is that I just take it as it's so good for the body and, you know, it's one of the missing links.
[01:28:11.527 --> 01:28:15.110]  But yeah, InfoWareStore.com does have the Survival Shield, something everybody can have.
[01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:22.101]  People can also, if they can't get your product, if you're sold out, and I know you're not price gouging like a lot of people did back in Fukushima.
[01:28:22.121 --> 01:28:24.824]  We're actually discounting it.
[01:28:25.304 --> 01:28:26.505]  People can also eat seaweed.
[01:28:27.226 --> 01:28:29.048]  Seaweed has a large amount of iodine in it.
[01:28:29.088 --> 01:28:36.395]  You'd have to check with your doctor to get the right amount to eat, but there are some other sources you can get if you don't have supplementary iodine, but people need to be prepared for this.
[01:28:36.475 --> 01:28:37.576]  I guess that's the problem.
[01:28:37.636 --> 01:28:39.839]  Some Himalayan salts have it, but a lot of them don't, right?
[01:28:40.219 --> 01:28:40.539]  That's right.
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:41.540]  That's right.
[01:28:42.341 --> 01:28:45.504]  So the big thing is get to the health food store and get seaweed.
[01:28:45.704 --> 01:28:46.405]  Seaweed tablets.
[01:28:47.085 --> 01:28:47.846]  Seaweed?
[01:28:47.886 --> 01:28:50.108]  Just eat seaweed actually.
[01:28:50.528 --> 01:28:52.070]  So go out to the ocean and get seaweed.
[01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:53.011]  Seaweed, have it natural.
[01:28:53.451 --> 01:28:54.092]  Yeah.
[01:28:54.112 --> 01:28:55.052]  Okay, we'll be right back folks.
[01:28:55.092 --> 01:28:56.033]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:28:56.234 --> 01:28:58.476]  I hope nothing happens, but this is really bad folks.
[01:28:58.856 --> 01:28:59.436]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:59.456 --> 01:28:59.817]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.856 --> 01:29:06.300]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.563]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:15.909]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:19.152]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:29:19.873 --> 01:29:23.316]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:29:23.696 --> 01:29:29.761]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:29:30.161 --> 01:29:35.125]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:29:35.874 --> 01:29:39.276]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:29:39.797 --> 01:29:46.341]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:29:47.002 --> 01:29:51.605]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:29:52.225 --> 01:29:57.310]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:29:57.910 --> 01:30:01.894]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:30:02.555 --> 01:30:04.817]  I think it is an utter lie.
[01:30:05.697 --> 01:30:10.081]  Most of the claims that people are making against you in the press and in court, they're just not true.
[01:30:14.107 --> 01:30:17.188]  I remember a month ago when you had your hearing here in Austin.
[01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:22.549]  I was there and I found it very unfortunate that the press wasn't allowed in the courtroom.
[01:30:22.569 --> 01:30:24.749]  They weren't allowed to have cameras in the courtroom.
[01:30:24.769 --> 01:30:25.749]  The judge didn't want that.
[01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:34.571]  I was distressed about that because as I sat there in the courtroom, I had not watched the entire video presentation myself until that point.
[01:30:34.831 --> 01:30:37.832]  I wanted to keep my mind clear and I said, let's just see how this looks.
[01:30:38.812 --> 01:30:44.401]  And when you watch that video, I'm looking around at the people in the courtroom thinking, how can you be here to protest that?
[01:30:45.748 --> 01:30:48.049]  Because, you know, you're- But the New York Times went out and lied about it.
[01:30:48.369 --> 01:30:53.892]  Waving attorney's fees, saying I'm sorry the family died years ago, apologizing it's out of context years ago.
[01:30:53.972 --> 01:30:54.612]  All of those facts.
[01:30:54.692 --> 01:31:00.635]  Dozens of videos of that, but the news sat there, the papers, and murdered the truth and didn't tell any of it.
[01:31:00.695 --> 01:31:07.218]  No, the story that they had was you trying to take $100,000 out of Sandy Hook's parents' pockets when you specifically waived that.
[01:31:07.698 --> 01:31:10.079]  I mean, that was- Even though them suing under law could trigger that.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.961]  In fact, it should trigger that.
[01:31:13.221 --> 01:31:19.308]  But what was that for you to see us waive the fees, which you say you've never seen anybody do, and then the media says the opposite, that they're sitting there?
[01:31:19.328 --> 01:31:20.329]  It didn't surprise me.
[01:31:20.489 --> 01:31:25.394]  You said they sighed when we waived it, like, oh, that took it away, oh.
[01:31:25.414 --> 01:31:27.977]  There was a groan in the courtroom.
[01:31:28.217 --> 01:31:30.338]  Because now they were going to have to go out and lie!
[01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:37.943]  Well, I think it bothered them because people like to think in terms of comic book characters, Alex.
[01:31:37.963 --> 01:31:57.235]  You know, they don't... To look at you as a three-dimensional human being, where, you know, I might disagree with you on X, I agree with you on Y, I think, you know, Z that you say is funny, and I think, you know, B that you say is silly, and then, you know, and then we agree on these things, and, you know, that's called nuance, that's called interaction, you know, I mean, I... Diversity.
[01:31:57.515 --> 01:32:05.726]  Yeah, I mean, I enjoy hanging out with you even off camera because, you know, I understand you and we can exchange ideas and I feel like we're both smarter afterwards.
[01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.169]  That's what real interaction is.
[01:32:08.329 --> 01:32:12.735]  But, you know, when you have this story where there has to be a villain, you've got to be the villain.
[01:32:13.882 --> 01:32:14.743]  God, what do you do?
[01:32:15.203 --> 01:32:21.227]  You know, if... I mean, there's a reason why in Star Wars you never see Darth Vader sitting there petting a kitten, right?
[01:32:21.247 --> 01:32:22.688]  There's just... They don't want to humanize him.
[01:32:22.788 --> 01:32:24.449]  Doesn't fit the story, right?
[01:32:24.509 --> 01:32:26.150]  So, you know, you don't have that.
[01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:32.975]  Humanizing somebody and looking at it that way and thinking, wow, maybe some of this comic book narrative isn't accurate.
[01:32:33.863 --> 01:32:46.613]  And that just stuck a spear in the side of this character and deflated it, because they're thinking, like, oh no, like, this is devastating to our narrative that he's this evil ogre.
[01:32:46.633 --> 01:32:49.496]  When he says, no, these parents have lost enough.
[01:32:49.536 --> 01:32:55.040]  I mean, you know, when he said these parents have lost enough, we're waiving everything over and above a dollar.
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:58.183]  What do you got now?
[01:32:59.064 --> 01:32:59.864]  Where's the evil now?
[01:33:05.794 --> 01:33:08.378]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:24.864 --> 01:33:28.766]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:29.706 --> 01:33:34.809]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.211 --> 01:33:41.872]  All right, folks, we are back live.
[01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:43.772]  I want to be clear.
[01:33:44.213 --> 01:33:50.602]  I'm not here pitching Survival Shield X2 because it's good for your thyroid and blocks the radioactive isotope of nuclear reactors meltdown.
[01:33:51.203 --> 01:33:57.753]  I don't promote Survival Shield X2 as an anti-radiation situation, even though it's really good for that.
[01:33:59.326 --> 01:34:02.187]  I promote it because you die without iodine.
[01:34:02.227 --> 01:34:14.412]  It's like oxygen or water or vitamin C. And we had a really good seaweed source, it was one of the top rated in the world five years ago, and the globalists, doing economic sabotage, reached out, found out where we were getting it, and blocked it.
[01:34:15.012 --> 01:34:21.355]  So then we found a source, working with a big top US lab that doesn't want to be named because they get harassed, to get it from oil companies where it's 9999999 pure.
[01:34:25.216 --> 01:34:26.837]  You gotta have a DEA license to get it.
[01:34:27.297 --> 01:34:28.557]  Once it's put in the palm oil, it isn't.
[01:34:28.838 --> 01:34:29.578]  It's all patented.
[01:34:29.918 --> 01:34:35.581]  This has been our best seller, but the oil companies then figured out what was going on, so they doubled, they tripled prices.
[01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:37.521]  I'm not going to sell this for $50.
[01:34:38.102 --> 01:34:39.942]  I'm not going to pay $20-something for it.
[01:34:40.743 --> 01:34:42.163]  I'm not going to sit there and do that.
[01:34:42.283 --> 01:34:47.586]  So I did a huge order at the old price, and then they still raised it.
[01:34:48.686 --> 01:34:49.587]  So I broke my contract.
[01:34:49.807 --> 01:34:50.427]  I said, that's it.
[01:34:50.607 --> 01:34:51.208]  No more X2.
[01:34:51.428 --> 01:34:53.329]  And this is the best, purest iodine out there.
[01:34:53.429 --> 01:34:54.710]  Everybody sees the difference.
[01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:55.950]  The others are bound to stuff.
[01:34:56.631 --> 01:34:57.451]  I wish there was other ones.
[01:34:57.831 --> 01:35:05.376]  We're working right now with some other petroleum exploring companies to try to have a new X2.
[01:35:05.396 --> 01:35:06.857]  Because we'll call it X3.
[01:35:07.657 --> 01:35:08.558]  And we may be close.
[01:35:10.151 --> 01:35:11.872]  This is the last run of X2.
[01:35:12.113 --> 01:35:13.294]  So I've broken the contract.
[01:35:13.434 --> 01:35:13.954]  This is it.
[01:35:14.435 --> 01:35:15.756]  X2, it's amazing.
[01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:17.757]  When I first took X2, it's made me lazy.
[01:35:18.118 --> 01:35:20.019]  I used to swim two miles a couple days a week and lift.
[01:35:20.039 --> 01:35:20.980]  I couldn't get the fat off.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.363]  I went from 280 pounds to 230-something pounds.
[01:35:25.644 --> 01:35:26.624]  I got a big head and big chest.
[01:35:26.644 --> 01:35:27.225]  Looks like I'm fat.
[01:35:27.265 --> 01:35:27.565]  I'm not.
[01:35:27.605 --> 01:35:28.146]  My clothes off.
[01:35:28.166 --> 01:35:29.307]  I look like a gorilla.
[01:35:29.687 --> 01:35:33.210]  But the point is, is that, I'm big boned, is that
[01:35:34.494 --> 01:35:35.895]  This stuff changed my life.
[01:35:35.935 --> 01:35:39.657]  Now, talk to your physician, because if you've already got preexisting issues, who knows?
[01:35:40.217 --> 01:35:42.138]  But iodine is life-giving.
[01:35:42.178 --> 01:35:43.378]  This is the end of X2.
[01:35:44.019 --> 01:35:45.800]  And I hope and pray to God we get something better.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:47.400]  People say, well, why are you 25% off?
[01:35:47.941 --> 01:35:49.661]  I always discount products.
[01:35:50.222 --> 01:35:55.204]  And like Mike Adams said, it feels weird with all this going on, or this being the end of X2, to do that.
[01:35:55.224 --> 01:35:56.185]  We normally discount at 25%.
[01:35:56.265 --> 01:35:56.585]  Okay?
[01:35:58.606 --> 01:36:02.848]  And so, until we get down to a few thousand bottles, it's going to be there.
[01:36:03.837 --> 01:36:07.458]  And then it's going to go to the full price in the last few thousand bottles.
[01:36:07.518 --> 01:36:09.399]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:09.719 --> 01:36:11.079]  And then you know you're getting a great product.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.680]  Just experience.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:12.340]  It takes a few weeks.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:22.764]  Now, when I first started taking it five years ago, before we even sold it, when they had patents, it was the newest thing, folks said, about two, three weeks in, you're going to feel really toxic and bad.
[01:36:23.384 --> 01:36:27.125]  And stuff's going to come out of your skin, and those spots on your face are going to go away.
[01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:27.705]  The sunspots.
[01:36:27.745 --> 01:36:28.485]  I thought, oh yeah, right.
[01:36:28.786 --> 01:36:29.366]  It all happened.
[01:36:30.166 --> 01:36:31.727]  But it was disgusting.
[01:36:31.827 --> 01:36:33.548]  I mean, all this stuff came out of my skin.
[01:36:34.049 --> 01:36:36.751]  All these things happened because this is what powers the whole body.
[01:36:37.271 --> 01:36:39.212]  And this is pure, so it goes right into your blood.
[01:36:39.513 --> 01:36:42.575]  I mean, the stuff we have so pure, it turns into gas above 90 degrees.
[01:36:42.755 --> 01:36:44.456]  Right there, like, I Dream of Jeannie, if you're watching.
[01:36:44.496 --> 01:36:45.156]  It's purple gas.
[01:36:46.557 --> 01:36:47.998]  And that's not, again, a fiction movie.
[01:36:48.018 --> 01:36:48.779]  That's happening.
[01:36:49.139 --> 01:36:49.860]  That's how pure it is.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:50.660]  Nobody else has got this.
[01:36:51.421 --> 01:36:53.042]  And so, this could be the end of it.
[01:36:54.363 --> 01:36:56.924]  We'll see, but I'm really working hard.
[01:36:57.184 --> 01:37:01.285]  SurvivalSylladex2, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:01.425 --> 01:37:04.126]  All right, getting back to Mike Adams.
[01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:06.747]  I want to get into the censorship and the attacks and striking back against it.
[01:37:06.807 --> 01:37:10.468]  Your emergency warning to the President in the next segment that's so powerful that went viral.
[01:37:11.528 --> 01:37:17.530]  But Mike, recapping why this hurricane is so devastating, they say at four
[01:37:19.212 --> 01:37:27.377]  Category now, maybe going to six, hitting T-boning major reactors, twelve in the path, one directly in the path, or two directly in the path.
[01:37:27.857 --> 01:37:28.797]  Why that's so important?
[01:37:28.817 --> 01:37:31.159]  Because the crisis of these rotting reactors.
[01:37:32.281 --> 01:37:34.563]  Well, let's back up and look at reactor design.
[01:37:34.583 --> 01:37:46.594]  You know, there's a much safer reactor design that has existed for many years that is self-cooling or self-regulating, but they don't want to use those reactors because they don't produce nuclear weapons fuel as a byproduct.
[01:37:46.654 --> 01:37:58.745]  So, the nuclear power industry has always had ties to the nuclear weapons industry, and as a result, they run a very unsafe design structure that has made people vulnerable.
[01:37:59.165 --> 01:37:59.626]  I'm good.
[01:38:14.139 --> 01:38:17.523]  You know, it's like the powers that be don't care about the American people.
[01:38:17.563 --> 01:38:23.730]  They don't care that they could irradiate and kill millions of people if there's a catastrophic failure.
[01:38:24.411 --> 01:38:32.581]  Also, by the way, these nuclear power plants are subject to cyber hacks, and many people believe that they've been penetrated by Chinese hackers in particular.
[01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:44.353]  Who are just waiting to pull the trigger on a certain day in a coordinated attack on the power grid and nuclear power facilities and fuel refineries and other key infrastructure.
[01:38:44.393 --> 01:38:46.836]  And they could use the hurricane as the cover.
[01:38:48.018 --> 01:38:48.699]  Well, absolutely.
[01:38:48.959 --> 01:39:02.049]  There are lots of ways that bad people could use the chaos of a hurricane to pull off many things, including one of the things, by the way, that you've been warning about, which is an attempted assassination of President Trump.
[01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:09.676]  And I agree with you, that's a very real risk, and the chaos of this storm will no doubt be leveraged in some way.
[01:39:09.736 --> 01:39:14.600]  The chaos in Washington, D.C., even, will be leveraged in some way to try to harm President Trump.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.422]  As far as this hurricane goes, I say everybody be prepared.
[01:39:18.783 --> 01:39:19.983]  Watch the hurricane path.
[01:39:20.444 --> 01:39:23.286]  Evacuate if you have an evacuation order.
[01:39:23.526 --> 01:39:27.489]  And if you don't, if you don't evacuate, even if you're in the surrounding areas, you better have a water filter.
[01:39:27.549 --> 01:39:27.989]  No joke.
[01:39:28.269 --> 01:39:32.532]  Because contaminated water is one of the biggest risks in the aftermath of flooding.
[01:39:32.772 --> 01:39:34.213]  When you have flooding, what do you get?
[01:39:34.473 --> 01:39:38.376]  You get cholera and E. coli and all kinds of salmonella and things.
[01:39:38.396 --> 01:39:40.838]  I was about to say, let's hit the other angles of this.
[01:39:41.138 --> 01:39:43.720]  No matter what Trump does, they're going to say he does a terrible job.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:47.363]  But I think he needs to get emergency teams at these reactors right now.
[01:39:47.743 --> 01:39:52.067]  He needs to just be up front, already responding to the hurricane, not just waiting.
[01:39:52.127 --> 01:39:57.071]  Because they're going to spin this, even though he's done a great job the last few hurricanes, they're going to say he didn't do a good job.
[01:39:58.072 --> 01:39:59.934]  Well, yeah, of course they are.
[01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:01.836]  But nevertheless,
[01:40:02.841 --> 01:40:04.503]  He has the power right now.
[01:40:04.603 --> 01:40:07.205]  I mean, he could declare a national emergency for this situation.
[01:40:07.245 --> 01:40:11.109]  Actually, we're already operating under a national emergency for other reasons that we could talk about later.
[01:40:11.649 --> 01:40:14.232]  In fact, we've been operating under a state of war since 2001, by the way.
[01:40:14.372 --> 01:40:18.055]  And that's how the Democrats in the deep state stay-behinds are blocking Trump.
[01:40:18.275 --> 01:40:22.419]  They're operating in the emergency government areas that Trump hasn't even gotten access to.
[01:40:22.659 --> 01:40:23.780]  He can't even run the White House.
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.363]  Not because he's incompetent, because he's surrounded by enemies.
[01:40:27.128 --> 01:40:27.428]  That's right.
[01:40:27.529 --> 01:40:27.889]  That's right.
[01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:29.571]  They are enemies of America.
[01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:32.054]  I'm happy to comment on that in more detail.
[01:40:32.675 --> 01:40:35.539]  And by the way, one phrase I want to mention.
[01:40:35.799 --> 01:40:37.040]  Military tribunals.
[01:40:37.581 --> 01:40:38.703]  That is the answer to this.
[01:40:38.863 --> 01:40:41.146]  Military tribunals for the deep state traders.
[01:40:42.407 --> 01:40:56.276]  Maybe we'll talk about that in a minute, but getting back to the hurricane situation, everybody, watch the maps, watch the NOAA maps, watch the projections of how big the storm surge is going to be, how much rainfall and flooding there's going to be, and just be ready, everybody.
[01:40:57.697 --> 01:40:59.919]  Three days of preparedness is not enough, in my opinion.
[01:41:00.199 --> 01:41:08.725]  You need to have several weeks at minimum of preparedness for this storm, even if you're not in the direct path of it, because there could be logistics breakdowns
[01:41:09.325 --> 01:41:10.466]  Across the entire U.S.
[01:41:10.566 --> 01:41:18.193]  East Coast, all the way from the southern tip of Florida to, you know, up in New York City, for that matter, or Boston, for that matter.
[01:41:18.253 --> 01:41:19.754]  So... Sure, let me answer this question.
[01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:24.138]  They were saying yesterday and today, whether underground or usually pretty accurate, that it was going to get up to a six.
[01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:26.459]  Now they're saying it's only a four, that it'll be a three.
[01:41:26.519 --> 01:41:29.002]  I mean, that's, that's, that's... I mean, do you think that's accurate, or who knows?
[01:41:29.761 --> 01:41:33.482]  Well, it's, you know, these software models fail all the time.
[01:41:33.542 --> 01:41:38.184]  I mean, they get better over the years, but even, like, the climate change software models are a total joke.
[01:41:38.564 --> 01:41:39.904]  So, I don't trust the models.
[01:41:39.924 --> 01:41:43.786]  You know, reality is what matters, and reality can't be 100% predicted.
[01:41:44.066 --> 01:41:46.527]  All you can do is control your preparedness.
[01:41:46.807 --> 01:41:49.408]  You're ready for anything that comes down, whether it's a Category 3, 4, or 5.
[01:41:51.869 --> 01:41:52.469]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:52.769 --> 01:41:53.690]  Only reality matters.
[01:41:53.730 --> 01:41:54.930]  That's a good bumper sticker.
[01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:59.312]  Only reality matters because it's such an insane asylum of craziness.
[01:41:59.332 --> 01:42:02.493]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about it's now mainstream news.
[01:42:02.613 --> 01:42:04.074]  Inside groups over to the president.
[01:42:04.654 --> 01:42:06.695]  CNN says Mike Pence ready to take over.
[01:42:06.775 --> 01:42:07.655]  Trump removed Trump.
[01:42:08.556 --> 01:42:09.816]  Trump's mismanaged.
[01:42:09.876 --> 01:42:11.357]  Trump's as bad as 9-11.
[01:42:11.997 --> 01:42:13.238]  What planet are they living on?
[01:42:13.298 --> 01:42:18.340]  How do they think they're going to kill this economy and kill the voters' wishes and get rid of Trump?
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.381]  Aren't they thinking, Mike, about what will happen if they remove Trump?
[01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:24.977]  The thing is, they're willing to destroy America to remove Trump.
[01:42:25.457 --> 01:42:26.398]  Never forget that.
[01:42:26.838 --> 01:42:36.902]  They are willing to unleash a catastrophic economic collapse or even, I believe, some kind of a large-scale weapon of mass destruction in a major city to take Trump out.
[01:42:37.302 --> 01:42:39.684]  Oh, they're willing to set a nuke off EMP anything.
[01:42:39.724 --> 01:42:41.505]  They are crazed maniacs.
[01:42:41.585 --> 01:42:42.265]  I've experienced it.
[01:42:42.285 --> 01:42:42.926]  You've experienced it.
[01:42:43.246 --> 01:42:47.449]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams getting into incredible censorship.
[01:42:47.909 --> 01:42:48.689]  56 days out.
[01:42:48.769 --> 01:42:49.970]  What's the Global's next move?
[01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:51.091]  How do we counter him?
[01:42:51.111 --> 01:42:51.631]  How do we win?
[01:42:51.651 --> 01:42:55.514]  I think, number one, we pray to God for the eyes to be open and for providence.
[01:42:56.094 --> 01:42:57.695]  We need to be praying right now, folks.
[01:42:57.715 --> 01:42:58.376]  Everybody does.
[01:43:03.055 --> 01:43:09.056]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:09.436 --> 01:43:12.037]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:12.637 --> 01:43:16.098]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:16.338 --> 01:43:20.599]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:21.039 --> 01:43:24.300]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:35.450]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:36.211 --> 01:43:44.759]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:54.927]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:44:00.392 --> 01:44:02.113]  Look at that.
[01:44:02.293 --> 01:44:06.337]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:44:06.377 --> 01:44:07.738]  That's because it's been denatured.
[01:44:07.798 --> 01:44:08.659]  It's been watered down.
[01:44:08.979 --> 01:44:09.740]  We didn't do that.
[01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:15.474]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that isn't the very best I can get?
[01:44:15.915 --> 01:44:17.556]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:44:18.136 --> 01:44:26.683]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:44:27.163 --> 01:44:28.844]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:44:28.884 --> 01:44:30.005]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:44:30.686 --> 01:44:33.208]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:44:33.248 --> 01:44:34.349]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:44:35.129 --> 01:44:38.051]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:44:45.595 --> 01:44:45.956]  Look it up!
[01:44:47.057 --> 01:44:53.065]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:44:53.105 --> 01:44:57.972]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[01:44:58.452 --> 01:45:00.655]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[01:45:00.695 --> 01:45:01.557]  InfoWareStore.com
[01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:16.388]  The circle is now complete.
[01:45:16.928 --> 01:45:18.948]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[01:45:19.089 --> 01:45:20.769]  Now I am the master.
[01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:23.330]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[01:45:26.831 --> 01:45:28.892]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[01:45:29.772 --> 01:45:30.813]  You can't win, Darth.
[01:45:31.713 --> 01:45:36.795]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:45:49.659 --> 01:45:49.979]  No!
[01:45:50.039 --> 01:46:11.076]  We are number one trending app in news.
[01:46:11.356 --> 01:46:12.177]  Number one

[01:47:23.345 --> 01:47:29.631]  I'm primitive, I'm real, I know the enemy, and if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalists!
[01:47:30.432 --> 01:47:34.176]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[01:47:34.236 --> 01:47:36.358]  You'll never defeat God!
[01:47:36.558 --> 01:47:38.140]  You'll never win!
[01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:41.743]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[01:47:48.148 --> 01:47:48.929]  You guys know who he is?
[01:47:48.989 --> 01:47:50.311]  You know Alex Jones as InfoWars?
[01:47:50.471 --> 01:47:52.534]  Very popular.
[01:47:52.554 --> 01:47:52.934]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:53.054 --> 01:47:53.896]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:54.016 --> 01:47:54.556]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:54.657 --> 01:47:55.538]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:55.678 --> 01:47:57.160]  Alex Jones for Alex Jones.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.001]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:58.041 --> 01:47:59.202]  From InfoWars.
[01:47:59.343 --> 01:47:59.863]  InfoWars.
[01:47:59.903 --> 01:48:00.384]  Yeah.
[01:48:00.424 --> 01:48:01.806]  But did that stop him?
[01:48:01.846 --> 01:48:02.046]  No!
[01:48:02.246 --> 01:48:02.647]  He did not!
[01:48:04.809 --> 01:48:06.591]  It kept going, okay?
[01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:08.672]  And just, it went everywhere.
[01:48:08.773 --> 01:48:12.415]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it.
[01:48:12.475 --> 01:48:14.417]  It's like the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:48:14.657 --> 01:48:17.319]  And so that's why the joke is on you.
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:19.241]  And that's why it's gonna continue.
[01:48:29.814 --> 01:48:39.741]  Well, we can have some fun with that, but that was back before we were banned across the internet.
[01:48:42.142 --> 01:48:43.163]  It's so surreal.
[01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:12.481]  That as Congress doesn't take action, as the President's taken some action, but not enough, because he's totally sabotaged and surrounded, that they're now into classical mainline conservative books being banned.
[01:49:12.521 --> 01:49:13.422]  It's all over the news.
[01:49:13.442 --> 01:49:14.563]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:49:14.603 --> 01:49:15.444]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:49:15.464 --> 01:49:17.506]  We're going to go over some of these articles.
[01:49:17.566 --> 01:49:18.667]  Trump campaign manager.
[01:49:18.727 --> 01:49:20.729]  Google a direct threat to democracy.
[01:49:20.749 --> 01:49:21.509]  He means our republic.
[01:49:22.375 --> 01:49:32.923]  And online freedom, and then it's coming out the Democrats are rigging everything, and Google said they'll deliver everybody to Hillary, and now they're going to defeat Trump.
[01:49:34.205 --> 01:49:44.713]  They're really, absolutely abusing their power right now, as if there's not going to be any future, as if they think they're invincible.
[01:49:44.733 --> 01:49:50.658]  And I wanted to ask Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, he put an article in a video he did a few days ago that went viral.
[01:49:52.025 --> 01:49:59.070]  Dealing with the fact that this is Trump's last chance, if we put that on screen, to really, really, really, really take action.
[01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:01.251]  Again, Paul Watson tweeted out the article.
[01:50:01.292 --> 01:50:03.793]  You can go to Prison Planet if you want to find that tweet.
[01:50:04.053 --> 01:50:04.794]  That's why I like Twitter.
[01:50:04.834 --> 01:50:06.055]  It's easy for people to search it.
[01:50:06.975 --> 01:50:18.624]  But, you know, we talked about it last segment, but Mike Adams, tell people the name of the article and the name of the video, because it's a whole hour you did, but it's really important, so we can put it on screen for people.
[01:50:19.375 --> 01:50:21.537]  We talked about it a couple times last segment.
[01:50:21.957 --> 01:50:24.759]  What's the name of that article, the name of that video for folks who want to pull it up?
[01:50:27.221 --> 01:50:28.001]  We'll fade your mic up.
[01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:28.261]  Hold on.
[01:50:28.561 --> 01:50:29.202]  We've got to start over.
[01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:30.723]  We're going to fade your mic up.
[01:50:30.763 --> 01:50:31.083]  Go ahead.
[01:50:31.243 --> 01:50:31.644]  You're on there now.
[01:50:33.334 --> 01:50:33.594]  We're good.
[01:50:50.288 --> 01:50:51.169]  We're good to go.
[01:51:07.898 --> 01:51:08.138]  We're good.
[01:51:28.687 --> 01:51:29.647]  We're good to go.
[01:51:58.494 --> 01:52:01.356]  Google has been complicit in trying to steal the election.
[01:52:01.396 --> 01:52:02.457]  This just came out yesterday.
[01:52:02.818 --> 01:52:04.919]  Google tried to steal the election to Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:04.939 --> 01:52:06.380]  This is now revealed in emails.
[01:52:06.741 --> 01:52:16.468]  So we know that Google engaged in exactly the kind of election meddling that Trump has, or Russia, is being accused of doing by the deranged left-wing media.
[01:52:16.508 --> 01:52:24.254]  So everything that the left says that Trump did, it turns out that actually Google did it, or the New York Times did it, or the DNC did it.
[01:52:24.735 --> 01:52:26.396]  And so this is a crisis.
[01:52:26.836 --> 01:52:32.657]  Trump has to take action now, or I believe he will be destroyed by this deep state coup.
[01:52:35.078 --> 01:52:37.078]  You're absolutely right, Mike.
[01:52:37.278 --> 01:52:37.938]  But I want to go back.
[01:52:38.018 --> 01:52:41.599]  One big part of your video is they're clearly getting ready to set me and Trump up for a false flag.
[01:52:41.619 --> 01:52:43.739]  And I'm going to do a whole video on this today or tomorrow.
[01:52:44.399 --> 01:52:49.780]  They have all these shows where if I confront Marco Rubio, I'm first nice, like, hey, they're sensory conservatives.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:51.360]  Will you do something?
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:52.401]  I don't know who you are.
[01:52:52.521 --> 01:52:53.941]  So then I get a little more aggressive.
[01:52:54.961 --> 01:53:00.486]  They call that bullying and say, well, Jones isn't being violent, but he's telegraphing secret violent codes.
[01:53:00.886 --> 01:53:04.349]  So the one independent AP are like, Jones has armed listeners.
[01:53:04.409 --> 01:53:05.651]  He must be taken off the air.
[01:53:06.311 --> 01:53:09.334]  And they're saying we're going to attack reporters.
[01:53:09.374 --> 01:53:14.138]  They had all the papers through the op-eds a month ago that Trump's going to attack reporters.
[01:53:14.598 --> 01:53:18.702]  So they put this talking point out that us saying they're liars is going to cause violence.
[01:53:19.242 --> 01:53:20.564]  Meanwhile, they're the ones coming out.
[01:53:21.610 --> 01:53:24.614]  In news days, say they're gonna kill me with, you know, stabbing me in the neck.
[01:53:25.254 --> 01:53:29.439]  So, they're the ones pushing violence, but clearly, I think they're planting a false flag on the media.
[01:53:29.459 --> 01:53:33.063]  They wouldn't be pre-programming this so hard if they weren't.
[01:53:33.103 --> 01:53:36.948]  And then the average person will say, well, Alex is so demonized, we're not gonna defend him.
[01:53:37.308 --> 01:53:44.854]  And then as soon as that happens, instead of just taking you off Amazon or Google or Facebook or Twitter, all conservatives will be taken off, period.
[01:53:45.074 --> 01:53:53.401]  Your bank accounts, everything, and they think you'll then submit, this is the Chinese Social Credit score, this is the mark of the beast, it's here, Mike Adams.
[01:53:53.441 --> 01:53:56.323]  So, so, you're speaking of the false flag situation.
[01:53:57.104 --> 01:53:57.664]  Right, right.
[01:53:57.944 --> 01:54:02.348]  I agree with your assessment that they are setting up you in particular
[01:54:03.047 --> 01:54:04.329]  We're good to go.
[01:54:20.806 --> 01:54:21.427]  We're good to go.
[01:54:40.976 --> 01:54:42.818]  Mark that they would find off the street, whatever.
[01:54:43.679 --> 01:54:48.964]  So the FBI has a lot of experience actually plotting terrorist activities domestically in the United States.
[01:54:49.504 --> 01:54:55.409]  Now, not everybody in the FBI is bad, of course, but the leadership was evil under James Comey.
[01:54:55.429 --> 01:54:57.451]  Oh, there's major leftist stay-behind networks.
[01:54:57.491 --> 01:55:04.218]  And again, every protester caught taking over the Kavanaugh hearings got caught outside being paid off cash by a Soros lawyer.
[01:55:04.798 --> 01:55:05.298]  So exactly.
[01:55:05.318 --> 01:55:10.782]  They just go one level further, where the New York Times goes, oh, here's where the Freedom Caucus plays baseball.
[01:55:11.262 --> 01:55:12.583]  They don't have any security.
[01:55:13.484 --> 01:55:18.427]  And then literally, they sent a Dennis Hastert acolyte out there and CNN said he was a hero.
[01:55:19.048 --> 01:55:20.869]  So these people are sick.
[01:55:22.267 --> 01:55:34.752]  And the point is that they can stage an event and then they can, by silencing you in advance, you won't be able to defend yourself against the false narrative that will be rolled out as a false narrative has been rolled out.
[01:55:34.772 --> 01:55:42.495]  I was about to say, did you see the nationwide deal that Facebook force-fed to all their people after they took me off saying, Jones bullied poor Native Americans.
[01:55:42.795 --> 01:55:50.658]  There's these pig-like racist ladies saying whites are subhuman, we're monkeys, my parents are brother and sister.
[01:55:51.298 --> 01:55:53.741]  And then they edit that out and have me yelling back at them.
[01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:56.683]  Imagine the criminal activity of Facebook.
[01:55:57.664 --> 01:55:58.125]  Right, right.
[01:55:58.365 --> 01:56:02.149]  And don't forget that the New York Times, of course, hired Sarah Jong.
[01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:07.053]  Who has tweets out there that are racist against white people.
[01:56:07.473 --> 01:56:09.015]  They're destroying people's reputation.
[01:56:09.035 --> 01:56:11.496]  Whites grow up in goblin holes in the ground.
[01:56:11.516 --> 01:56:12.297]  They're subhuman.
[01:56:12.337 --> 01:56:13.057]  Exterminate them.
[01:56:13.318 --> 01:56:14.539]  It's like, yes!
[01:56:14.759 --> 01:56:15.519]  Yes!
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:22.704]  So the censorship of you, of course, is selective application of their rules that they really can't even define.
[01:56:22.765 --> 01:56:27.228]  Basically, it all comes down to they don't like Alex Jones and they want to cut you off.
[01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:29.651]  I think it's worse than that.
[01:56:29.951 --> 01:56:37.818]  They blame you for what's coming, and then they want to use that to cement the silencing of conservative and pro-American voices all across the country.
[01:56:38.138 --> 01:56:40.420]  Oh, I totally agree, because I'm not that important.
[01:56:40.741 --> 01:56:50.489]  They picked me to build me up to be destroyed because they knew we were a populist movement, and then once people don't stand up for me when it happens, then everyone loses everything.
[01:56:51.271 --> 01:56:51.551]  That's right.
[01:56:51.691 --> 01:56:52.031]  That's right.
[01:56:52.472 --> 01:57:02.317]  And then there will be no one left to speak on behalf of President Trump when they try to pull a 25th Amendment or an execution or a weapon of mass destruction or something else.
[01:57:02.818 --> 01:57:10.702]  I am convinced, Alex, they will kill any number of people necessary or destroy the entire economy if necessary to get Trump out of office.
[01:57:10.742 --> 01:57:10.982]  I agree.
[01:57:11.022 --> 01:57:11.603]  This is a war.
[01:57:11.623 --> 01:57:13.885]  Because the CHICOMS and the Globalist America was done.
[01:57:14.206 --> 01:57:15.087]  The deal was going to happen.
[01:57:15.107 --> 01:57:15.968]  People found out about it.
[01:57:16.008 --> 01:57:16.628]  They said no.
[01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:18.430]  And now we're in the fight of our lives.
[01:57:18.450 --> 01:57:20.132]  We'll be right back with five more minutes with Mike Adams.
[01:57:20.453 --> 01:57:22.415]  We have another special guest joining us.
[01:57:22.455 --> 01:57:23.276]  But this isn't hype.
[01:57:23.416 --> 01:57:24.237]  We're being silenced.
[01:57:24.677 --> 01:57:26.179]  Amazon's banning conservative books.
[01:57:26.519 --> 01:57:28.141]  They're just testing, testing, testing.
[01:57:28.241 --> 01:57:29.362]  And I've been told by
[01:57:30.458 --> 01:57:36.882]  Two White House sources, a campaign source, and then another source connected to the president and his outreach programs.
[01:57:37.323 --> 01:57:40.145]  Four sources that the executive orders are imminent.
[01:57:40.665 --> 01:57:41.566]  But they've got to be.
[01:57:41.646 --> 01:57:42.907]  They're the ones that started the fight.
[01:57:43.327 --> 01:57:44.848]  America is at the crossroads.
[01:57:44.928 --> 01:57:46.749]  America is hanging by a thread.
[01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.570]  We'll be back.
[01:57:47.630 --> 01:57:48.491]  Spread the live links.
[01:57:48.531 --> 01:57:50.152]  Tell folks about local stations right now.
[01:57:57.557 --> 01:58:03.239]  When you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[01:58:04.279 --> 01:58:07.660]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:58:08.081 --> 01:58:16.464]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:58:16.784 --> 01:58:21.045]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:58:21.365 --> 01:58:22.306]  You are the Infowar.
[01:58:22.806 --> 01:58:26.347]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:58:27.059 --> 01:58:38.622]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:38.682 --> 01:58:48.585]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:49.165 --> 01:58:49.846]  We're good to go.
[01:59:08.882 --> 01:59:11.963]  We are following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:59:12.343 --> 01:59:14.403]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:14.884 --> 01:59:19.825]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are or where we came from.
[01:59:20.385 --> 01:59:28.047]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:28.547 --> 01:59:35.009]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:37.010]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:38.930]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:40.771]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:41.411 --> 01:59:43.091]  And many others are across the world.
[01:59:43.331 --> 01:59:44.011]  We are the future.
[01:59:44.952 --> 01:59:45.892]  We are the Renaissance.
[01:59:46.432 --> 01:59:47.712]  And we are winning.
[01:59:49.953 --> 02:00:00.416]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:13.691]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:00:13.912 --> 02:00:16.915]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:00:16.995 --> 02:00:20.278]  In the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[02:00:21.159 --> 02:00:23.000]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[02:00:25.223 --> 02:00:28.205]  The interest is up and the stock market's down.
[02:00:28.266 --> 02:00:31.168]  And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[02:00:36.841 --> 02:00:42.185]  I live back in the woods you see, my woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[02:00:48.028 --> 02:00:59.634]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com has put together a really powerful, long, detailed article about Fukushima in America.
[02:00:59.674 --> 02:01:05.217]  Twelve nuclear power plants are in the path of Hurricane Florence, flooding, storm surge, threatening cooling operations.
[02:01:05.757 --> 02:01:07.178]  It's the same scenario as Fukushima.
[02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:09.270]  We're not saying that's happening.
[02:01:10.150 --> 02:01:21.718]  We're saying we want to draw additional attention to it because these corporations will just hope nothing happens and they don't want any bad PR so they won't muster an emergency like Japan did and then the crisis happens.
[02:01:22.258 --> 02:01:24.540]  Mike, in closing, I appreciate your great work.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:31.525]  You've been doing great things for decades but now you've really been doing yeoman's work, Herculean work in the Aegean stables here.
[02:01:32.737 --> 02:01:45.481]  Just in closing, in the four minutes we have left, I get a little hysterical here on air because I live in the middle of this and we see the mutiny, the preparations, the 25th Amendment calls to remove the president, them saying he's doing a horrible job, the economy coming back.
[02:01:45.901 --> 02:01:48.641]  It is the best of time, worst of time, tale of two cities.
[02:01:49.442 --> 02:01:51.842]  And I'm just asking listeners, politically get in the arena.
[02:01:52.262 --> 02:01:54.303]  The next 56 days are so critical.
[02:01:54.863 --> 02:01:57.244]  In closing, what else do you want to impart to people about
[02:01:58.204 --> 02:02:00.945]  We're all blocked everywhere on 90% of the web.
[02:02:00.985 --> 02:02:03.025]  It's up to them to share the articles, the videos.
[02:02:03.045 --> 02:02:04.006]  This is total war.
[02:02:04.386 --> 02:02:10.047]  And if they get off the bench, if the big dog gets off the bench, it's game over.
[02:02:10.347 --> 02:02:14.828]  And we did that to Hillary already, but I believe the globalists have miscalculated.
[02:02:14.888 --> 02:02:21.590]  I believe if we take action, we're about to see a new, true renaissance for humanity.
[02:02:22.930 --> 02:02:25.491]  Well, Trump has the power to save this republic.
[02:02:26.050 --> 02:02:29.632]  The question is, will he invoke it aggressively and in time?
[02:02:30.553 --> 02:02:41.560]  Interestingly, Barack Obama signed the executive orders into power that have now
[02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:44.010]  We're good to go.
[02:02:57.512 --> 02:03:02.796]  He must now, at this point, realize that it's a matter of not just saving America, but also saving himself.
[02:03:03.217 --> 02:03:05.118]  It's self-preservation at this point.
[02:03:05.438 --> 02:03:15.927]  If he does not invoke these powers, if he does not get rid of Jeff Sessions, if he does not issue arrests for Hillary Clinton, then basically this republic is over.
[02:03:15.947 --> 02:03:20.070]  But I want President Trump to know that we, the people, are behind him.
[02:03:20.610 --> 02:03:21.291]  We back him.
[02:03:21.711 --> 02:03:22.972]  And if he puts out a call
[02:03:24.346 --> 02:03:31.513]  And says, uh, I need all the American patriots right now to come to Washington and defend this country against deep state traitors.
[02:03:31.833 --> 02:03:34.896]  He would have a million men and women show up.
[02:03:35.116 --> 02:03:35.636]  He'd have 20 million?
[02:03:35.656 --> 02:03:36.637]  And help defend this nation.
[02:03:36.918 --> 02:03:37.959]  Yeah, yeah, more than a million.
[02:03:38.219 --> 02:03:43.584]  He has all the cards, and he's a judicious good guy, so he keeps thinking all he needs is prosperity.
[02:03:43.644 --> 02:03:43.804]  No.
[02:03:44.064 --> 02:03:46.086]  The globals, like you said, are willing to wreck everything.
[02:03:46.326 --> 02:03:47.047]  It's about power.
[02:03:48.742 --> 02:03:51.963]  I believe that mass arrests need to be made against these deep state traitors.
[02:03:52.244 --> 02:03:53.124]  They need to be exposed.
[02:03:53.144 --> 02:03:54.584]  They're globalists.
[02:03:54.604 --> 02:03:55.945]  They're trying to subvert us.
[02:03:56.025 --> 02:03:56.485]  Exactly.
[02:03:56.705 --> 02:03:58.586]  You can't deal with them like a normal political group.
[02:03:58.626 --> 02:03:59.466]  They're an enemy army.
[02:04:00.467 --> 02:04:05.709]  No, and hopefully Trump is long past the point of trying to get along with the opposition.
[02:04:05.769 --> 02:04:07.090]  You can't get along with traitors.
[02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:08.010]  They don't want you to.
[02:04:08.210 --> 02:04:09.471]  They're not interested in coexistence.
[02:04:09.491 --> 02:04:10.451]  They're not giving quarters.
[02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:11.751]  They're trying to dominate us.
[02:04:12.412 --> 02:04:12.792]  That's right.
[02:04:12.852 --> 02:04:13.172]  That's right.
[02:04:13.432 --> 02:04:14.513]  Look, they want to overthrow the country.
[02:04:14.533 --> 02:04:15.873]  They want communism to sweep in.
[02:04:16.193 --> 02:04:17.954]  And they've drawn first blood politically.
[02:04:19.304 --> 02:04:21.847]  Well, absolutely they have, and the evidence is there.
[02:04:22.028 --> 02:04:23.369]  President Trump, just release it.
[02:04:23.449 --> 02:04:24.350]  Declassify.
[02:04:24.711 --> 02:04:25.592]  It's all there.
[02:04:26.012 --> 02:04:29.236]  History is waiting for you to make this decision.
[02:04:29.276 --> 02:04:29.837]  Just do it.
[02:04:29.857 --> 02:04:34.623]  I mean, Nike should have President Trump as their spokesperson, frankly.
[02:04:34.983 --> 02:04:36.044]  Just do it, President Trump.
[02:04:36.225 --> 02:04:37.166]  Release the documents.
[02:04:38.194 --> 02:04:41.115]  He needs to right now release the secret documents and everything else.
[02:04:41.495 --> 02:04:44.956]  Mike Adams, powerful information at naturalnews.com.
[02:04:45.237 --> 02:04:46.117]  Thank you for your great work.
[02:04:46.137 --> 02:04:51.639]  We're going to be right back to Clyde Lewis with even more bombshell information about the very structure of the Deep State.
[02:04:51.979 --> 02:04:53.400]  You do not want to miss this.
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:56.041]  He blew me away when I was on his show two weeks ago.
[02:04:56.121 --> 02:04:56.941]  Blew me away.
[02:05:05.288 --> 02:05:11.309]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[02:05:11.709 --> 02:05:12.590]  And I want to thank you all.
[02:05:12.670 --> 02:05:13.630]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:15.430]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:21.732]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[02:05:22.012 --> 02:05:24.132]  And we've got products that help you.
[02:05:24.152 --> 02:05:27.133]  I mean, even mainstream media admits they have to, that fish roe is the best thing ever.
[02:05:27.333 --> 02:05:28.535]  But you want the pure fish oil.
[02:05:28.635 --> 02:05:30.036]  You want the mercury removed.
[02:05:30.156 --> 02:05:32.419]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[02:05:32.579 --> 02:05:33.340]  The best krill oil.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:36.043]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[02:05:36.103 --> 02:05:39.547]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[02:05:40.007 --> 02:05:40.488]  The honor roll.
[02:05:40.508 --> 02:05:41.129]  Three different types.
[02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:42.110]  You cannot do better.
[02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:42.971]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:43.011 --> 02:05:43.551]  Help the brain.
[02:05:43.592 --> 02:05:44.032]  Help the body.
[02:05:44.072 --> 02:05:44.513]  Help the heart.
[02:05:44.553 --> 02:05:45.073]  Help the InfoWare.
[02:05:45.093 --> 02:05:45.714]  Win, win, win, win.
[02:05:45.834 --> 02:05:48.436]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:06:17.630 --> 02:06:29.180]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.762]  Scum!
[02:06:31.582 --> 02:06:34.085]  Russian scum!
[02:06:34.265 --> 02:06:39.109]  The whole world comes to mind.
[02:06:43.186 --> 02:06:44.707]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:06:45.087 --> 02:06:46.408]  I will not let you down.
[02:06:46.568 --> 02:06:49.450]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:06:53.532 --> 02:06:55.113]  ...war on corruption.
[02:06:55.594 --> 02:07:00.697]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:07:19.053 --> 02:07:19.734]  All right, folks.
[02:07:19.774 --> 02:07:22.256]  We're back live here in the third hour.
[02:07:22.277 --> 02:07:24.219]  Paul Watson's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:07:24.799 --> 02:07:28.903]  He's got one of the best-selling authors who just got banned off of Amazon.
[02:07:28.943 --> 02:07:33.889]  First time ever an author's been banned for a dating book about, you know, for conservative men.
[02:07:34.690 --> 02:07:35.630]  This is just getting crazy.
[02:07:35.671 --> 02:07:37.052]  That's coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:07:37.653 --> 02:07:39.154]  Clyde Lewis could be on there for 10 hours.
[02:07:39.214 --> 02:07:40.335]  I was on his show for three hours.
[02:07:41.537 --> 02:07:47.401]  And, you know, I've heard a show many times syndicated to 400 stations of, you know, very popular filmmaker in his own right.
[02:07:48.602 --> 02:08:00.930]  But I was on his show and I had forgotten so many things he was talking about, about the internet kill switch and about this special FCC office that Obama set up to be able to take over the internet and put people inside newsrooms.
[02:08:01.611 --> 02:08:07.394]  And then with what I've dealt with the media, the terms and things they were using were exactly what's happening to me now.
[02:08:07.434 --> 02:08:11.177]  And then I looked at the executive order while I was on a show for three hours during breaks.
[02:08:11.937 --> 02:08:14.099]  And I was like, wow, somebody just taught me something.
[02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:20.705]  And I learn stuff all the time, but when it comes to martial law, kill switches, how it works, a lot of folks don't teach me stuff.
[02:08:21.566 --> 02:08:23.027]  And so I was like, please come on my show.
[02:08:23.067 --> 02:08:23.808]  And he's a late night host.
[02:08:23.828 --> 02:08:24.969]  He's like, OK, I will.
[02:08:25.009 --> 02:08:27.611]  But I want to invite him back for three hours in the near future.
[02:08:28.111 --> 02:08:31.474]  Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[02:08:31.494 --> 02:08:31.895]  Remember that?
[02:08:32.775 --> 02:08:38.300]  And that's what's set up with the old corporate media, the big tech companies, the censorship, claiming we're all Russians.
[02:08:38.721 --> 02:08:42.204]  And once they say you're a Russian, then they turn the CIA loose on you.
[02:08:42.704 --> 02:08:47.509]  But his big article, Keeping Up With The Jones, our red-faced canary in the coal mine.
[02:08:48.129 --> 02:08:54.655]  And then this goes back to articles he wrote three, four years ago, detailing in all the FCC aborts plan to infiltrate newsrooms.
[02:08:55.636 --> 02:09:00.861]  That's TheHeavy.com, Commissioner Pye's statement on suspension of CIN study.
[02:09:01.382 --> 02:09:03.083]  So, Clyde's a nice guy.
[02:09:03.103 --> 02:09:08.649]  He'll pause a lot for me, but if that happens, he'll never get to talk.
[02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:10.891]  So I'm going to give him the floor for most of this hour.
[02:09:11.291 --> 02:09:14.634]  A brief guide to the FCC newsroom invasion panic.
[02:09:15.255 --> 02:09:18.638]  But Obama did set up the kill switch, and then he left it behind.
[02:09:19.099 --> 02:09:20.100]  And just like you read about
[02:09:20.998 --> 02:09:21.719]  Look at these headlines.
[02:09:22.199 --> 02:09:24.280]  Trump loyalists for White House purge.
[02:09:24.841 --> 02:09:26.382]  And you've got Donald Trump Jr.
[02:09:26.402 --> 02:09:33.567]  coming out saying, yeah, he only trusts like five people in the White House because they're revolting against him.
[02:09:33.587 --> 02:09:35.148]  People keep saying Trump do this, do that.
[02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:37.910]  The bureaucracies aren't doing what he says.
[02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.931]  Atlantic Monthly.
[02:09:39.844 --> 02:09:45.688]  Two months into Trump in the office says, we need 25th Amendment, we need everybody in the agency to not follow what he says and sabotage him.
[02:09:46.288 --> 02:09:53.193]  Well he's only gotten partial tax cuts and partial regulation fixes and announced America open for business and all the graphs are going straight up.
[02:09:54.394 --> 02:10:00.297]  And here's that article, Trump only trusts small group in White House after op-ed son says, this is a psy-op.
[02:10:00.337 --> 02:10:03.259]  So I gotta say, I'm really completely blown away.
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:08.123]  I was blown away with Clyde Lewis when I was on with him.
[02:10:09.212 --> 02:10:13.973]  and everything that he got into on his show.
[02:10:14.033 --> 02:10:20.555]  So I want him to take you next level on the big event, the final blow, he calls it, Ground Zero Media.
[02:10:20.955 --> 02:10:25.236]  GroundZeroMedia.org or Clyde Lewis on Twitter for now.
[02:10:25.256 --> 02:10:28.037]  I know he got persecuted for even having me on on Facebook.
[02:10:28.337 --> 02:10:30.278]  So GroundZeroMedia.org.
[02:10:30.318 --> 02:10:33.318]  Clyde Lewis, thank you so much for joining us on September 11th, 2018.
[02:10:36.075 --> 02:10:37.216]  I think it's a coincidence.
[02:10:37.296 --> 02:10:50.347]  I wasn't really thinking about 9-11, but I think it's a good time to have us both together on 9-11, especially with all the hard work you did to bring forward information back then and the work that I did as well.
[02:10:50.688 --> 02:10:57.854]  You know, it's interesting that I remember one of the things, one of the points that the mainstream media had made
[02:10:58.494 --> 02:11:02.438]  To shut you down was you saying that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:11:02.458 --> 02:11:16.834]  I just want to make it clear that 84% of the American people believe that 9-11 was not explained correctly, that the information and the investigation was pretty much a farce.
[02:11:17.234 --> 02:11:18.836]  There were national polls on that.
[02:11:20.054 --> 02:11:23.776]  Yeah, national polls saying that, hey, we didn't get an investigation we wanted.
[02:11:24.697 --> 02:11:30.541]  Even the media itself back then, if you recall, were saying things like Osama bin Laden was not involved.
[02:11:31.581 --> 02:11:38.566]  Even Dick Cheney had said in a press conference something about how Osama bin Laden wasn't involved.
[02:11:39.326 --> 02:11:45.030]  And there are a number of things, too, like Tom Brokaw, if I remember, and a number of other newscasters.
[02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:49.173]  Prince Vandar famously, the week after, went on, I said I wouldn't interrupt, here we go,
[02:11:49.973 --> 02:11:52.936]  He went on Larry King and said that Bin Laden wasn't involved.
[02:11:54.097 --> 02:12:08.952]  Yeah, and if you want to know where the conspiracy theories come from, I mean the newsrooms themselves, I remember Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw were saying, if you look at the buildings come down, if you're familiar with how controlled demolitions operate,
[02:12:09.352 --> 02:12:17.039]  You'll notice how the buildings have come down uniformly and I was surprised that not very many people had picked up on that.
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:28.249]  I picked up on that because I'm a, you know, I'm a media junkie and I have to pay attention to what the mainstream says in order to, I guess, counter what they say, examine what they say.
[02:12:28.509 --> 02:12:30.511]  My theory is that the FBI was ordered to stand down.
[02:12:30.691 --> 02:12:32.473]  Dozens of agents came forward and said that.
[02:12:32.513 --> 02:12:33.494]  I was just saying what they said.
[02:12:34.724 --> 02:12:46.971]  Well, and not only that, but you remember, too, that there was a number of, I guess you'd call them preparedness drills with regard to, you know, whether or not planes could fly into areas and destroy buildings.
[02:12:47.091 --> 02:12:53.415]  In fact, I remember back during the Olympics, when they had them in Georgia, Condoleezza Rice and several others,
[02:12:53.755 --> 02:12:55.377]  We're already in the planning.
[02:12:56.798 --> 02:13:09.993]  Condoleezza Rice had said, well we didn't even plan on this to happen, but yet when the Olympics happened in Georgia, they were already planning for contingency if a plane was to be flying in, bringing in some sort of biological weapon or something.
[02:13:10.493 --> 02:13:17.796]  And of course, the Project for a New American Century, when you're reading about their plans, that is a letter of intent, in my opinion.
[02:13:17.836 --> 02:13:31.581]  I mean, if a school kid was to write down on a piece of paper that he planned on attacking the teacher, or planned on shooting the principal, and he submitted that, he'd be put in jail and banned from school.
[02:13:31.962 --> 02:13:37.704]  But when you get a group of leaders together saying that we need another new Pearl Harbor in order to galvanize, or at least
[02:13:38.424 --> 02:13:41.246]  Push the issue of expansion in the Middle East.
[02:13:41.566 --> 02:13:45.929]  I think that the American people need to understand that that is a letter of intent.
[02:13:45.989 --> 02:13:49.852]  It was a letter of intent from the beginning and it certainly is a letter of intent now.
[02:13:50.212 --> 02:14:02.641]  And I think it stands to reason that anyone who sits there and tells you that you're a crank because you think that somebody involved in government, a criminal element or the criminal cabal now that we know is the deep state of the shadow government, they've been involved with this from the very beginning.
[02:14:03.121 --> 02:14:05.523]  And you see, I'm a history person.
[02:14:05.824 --> 02:14:10.067]  I go back and I dig through history and find these things, but the media won't do that.
[02:14:10.167 --> 02:14:15.852]  And of course, they'll rebuke you and they'll certainly say, well, Alex Jones thinks it's an inside job.
[02:14:15.872 --> 02:14:17.674]  Well, I think it's an inside job.
[02:14:17.974 --> 02:14:19.856]  It's obvious that it's an inside job.
[02:14:20.096 --> 02:14:28.963]  And any American who doesn't want to get ratcheted up in the emotion of it all has to set aside their emotions and understand that it is anathema.
[02:14:30.084 --> 02:14:34.466]  In my opinion, a smack in the face to Americans and those who died.
[02:14:34.486 --> 02:14:35.326]  Well, Clyde, it is.
[02:14:35.506 --> 02:14:36.947]  I mean, I'll just tell the story briefly.
[02:14:37.547 --> 02:14:42.169]  I've been on air like 9, 10 hours that day, and I was broadcasting out of my house, and I was hungry.
[02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:43.809]  There was a pizza place literally a mile away.
[02:14:44.349 --> 02:14:49.011]  So I'm driving to get pizza, and back then CBS still had CBS Radio on 590 AM.
[02:14:49.031 --> 02:14:50.291]  It turned to like Fox a month later.
[02:14:50.812 --> 02:14:53.713]  And I'm waiting to get the pizza out to the pizza place, and I'm listening, and they go,
[02:14:54.873 --> 02:15:00.194]  Solomon Brothers building, building 7, they've put bombs in it to bring it down so it won't damage other buildings.
[02:15:00.634 --> 02:15:05.175]  So I go back, get on the radio and go, CBS just announced they're going to blow up building 7.
[02:15:05.735 --> 02:15:07.095]  And then callers are going, yeah.
[02:15:07.836 --> 02:15:10.616]  And I run out there in the room and it's on the big screen TV in my house.
[02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:15.857]  They blew it up and they go, oh no, it just fell and I went, I just heard CBS say they blew it up.
[02:15:16.237 --> 02:15:20.178]  And then they went, I was, but years later they released the archived tapes where they said that.
[02:15:21.584 --> 02:15:22.985]  Well, and here's something else.
[02:15:23.965 --> 02:15:27.386]  I was at a conference, it was a conspiracy conference in San Francisco.
[02:15:27.946 --> 02:15:30.787]  And someone had asked me, so what are you going to do next year?
[02:15:30.807 --> 02:15:33.248]  I can't remember what year it was.
[02:15:33.268 --> 02:15:35.509]  What are you going to do next year that's going to better your program?
[02:15:35.529 --> 02:15:37.130]  What is your goal?
[02:15:37.730 --> 02:15:39.931]  And I said, I think I'm going to do an investigation into Building 6.
[02:15:41.204 --> 02:15:42.405]  And he goes, you mean building seven?
[02:15:42.425 --> 02:15:43.986]  I go, no, I mean building six.
[02:15:44.507 --> 02:15:45.167]  And they said, why?
[02:15:45.187 --> 02:15:48.310]  And I said, well, if you take a look at the footage... Well, stay there.
[02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:49.030]  It's a cliffhanger.
[02:15:49.070 --> 02:15:50.331]  Yeah, let's talk about six.
[02:15:50.371 --> 02:15:51.092]  This is even bigger.
[02:15:51.692 --> 02:15:52.072]  Exactly.
[02:15:52.112 --> 02:15:53.654]  They weren't just blowing up three buildings, folks.
[02:15:54.134 --> 02:15:56.856]  And again, we interviewed the head of emergency management who said there were bombs.
[02:15:57.216 --> 02:15:58.758]  He died a week after he was on.
[02:15:59.818 --> 02:16:00.599]  But he didn't really die.
[02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:01.620]  It was witness protection program.
[02:16:02.356 --> 02:16:05.599]  Alex Jones was quite the spectacle today.
[02:16:05.659 --> 02:16:14.185]  The most relevant part of this so far has been an interaction that Marco Rubio had while talking to reporters with Alex Jones.
[02:16:14.426 --> 02:16:19.450]  You know, look, part of this I think you could argue and say, why are you guys giving them any attention for this nonsense?
[02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:21.411]  But I think there's a point to this that's important.
[02:16:21.871 --> 02:16:22.912]  Here is this sort of spectacle.
[02:16:22.932 --> 02:16:27.696]  Marco Rubio is doing an interview and Alex Jones bumbles up to him.
[02:16:27.756 --> 02:16:33.763]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[02:16:33.984 --> 02:16:40.372]  I think Facebook now, I think it's important for them not to comply with any efforts to sort of go after freedom of expression.
[02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:42.194]  What about the Democrats purging conservatives?
[02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:43.335]  She's not answering.
[02:16:44.256 --> 02:16:46.438]  Just that the Republicans are acting like it isn't happening.
[02:16:46.458 --> 02:16:47.218]  Thank God Trump is.
[02:16:47.959 --> 02:16:48.459]  That's weird.
[02:16:48.959 --> 02:16:49.660]  Oh yeah, it's really weird.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:50.821]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[02:16:50.861 --> 02:16:51.942]  There's no shadowbanning.
[02:16:52.022 --> 02:16:54.743]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:16:54.763 --> 02:16:58.126]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[02:16:58.266 --> 02:17:00.808]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[02:17:01.028 --> 02:17:04.290]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after...
[02:17:05.771 --> 02:17:07.292]  Is that a heckler or a press gaggle?
[02:17:07.392 --> 02:17:08.053]  Look at this guy.
[02:17:08.093 --> 02:17:10.194]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[02:17:10.234 --> 02:17:11.475]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[02:17:11.535 --> 02:17:12.716]  I don't read all your websites.
[02:17:12.776 --> 02:17:13.036]  Sure.
[02:17:13.156 --> 02:17:15.498]  And they DNI'd me in these very hearings.
[02:17:15.538 --> 02:17:16.258]  Then he plays dumb.
[02:17:16.358 --> 02:17:18.420]  Infowars.com, you know what it is.
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:18.780]  Oh, well.
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:21.822]  Does Google, does Facebook, do they need to be regulated?
[02:17:21.862 --> 02:17:25.045]  Do they need to be regulated?
[02:17:25.085 --> 02:17:26.606]  Marco Rubio?
[02:17:26.626 --> 02:17:28.327]  This little frat boy here.
[02:17:28.347 --> 02:17:28.867]  Who are you?
[02:17:29.027 --> 02:17:29.468]  Yeah, sure.
[02:17:29.568 --> 02:17:31.529]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are, man.
[02:17:31.729 --> 02:17:32.510]  Tens of millions of views?
[02:17:33.010 --> 02:17:34.211]  InfoWars, InfoWars.
[02:17:34.811 --> 02:17:35.972]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[02:17:36.032 --> 02:17:37.073]  He's playing this joke over here.
[02:17:37.253 --> 02:17:39.475]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[02:17:39.495 --> 02:17:40.996]  Here's the question, here's the question.
[02:17:41.016 --> 02:17:41.997]  Don't touch me again, man.
[02:17:42.077 --> 02:17:42.937]  I'm asking you not to touch me.
[02:17:42.957 --> 02:17:43.778]  What's the matter with you?
[02:17:43.818 --> 02:17:44.298]  Nice to meet you.
[02:17:44.378 --> 02:17:45.499]  I know, but I don't want to be touched.
[02:17:45.519 --> 02:17:46.480]  You want me to get arrested?
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:47.881]  It's not just going to take my birth amendment.
[02:17:47.941 --> 02:17:49.642]  It's not just enough to take my birth amendment?
[02:17:50.383 --> 02:17:51.223]  Oh, he'll beat me up.
[02:17:51.284 --> 02:17:51.964]  I didn't say that.
[02:17:51.984 --> 02:17:53.045]  I know I am, but he's so mad.
[02:17:53.485 --> 02:17:54.746]  You're not going to silence me.
[02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:55.927]  You're not going to silence America.
[02:17:55.947 --> 02:17:58.889]  But there are people... You are literally like a little gangster thug.
[02:17:58.930 --> 02:18:02.372]  There are people in this country... Rubio has threatened to physically take care of me.
[02:18:02.412 --> 02:18:05.815]  There are people who feel that they are being silenced.
[02:18:05.875 --> 02:18:09.598]  He tells you China is the problem, which it is, but they're taking our free speech right now.
[02:18:09.718 --> 02:18:12.560]  Social media platforms, Facebook, Twitter... There goes Rubio.
[02:18:12.901 --> 02:18:18.145]  Do you believe that these platforms need to be regulated like a public utility and how do you go about doing that?
[02:18:18.465 --> 02:18:19.666]  Well, I'd prefer not to.
[02:18:19.686 --> 02:18:21.267]  I'd prefer competition take care of that.
[02:18:21.307 --> 02:18:27.611]  But obviously, we're going to watch closely to make sure that these tools that are being used... I mean, one thing is to say we're going to go after foreign interference, design, and so on and so forth.
[02:18:27.631 --> 02:18:28.672]  But it's already going on here.
[02:18:28.732 --> 02:18:30.353]  Another thing is to say we're going to go after free speech.
[02:18:30.393 --> 02:18:31.854]  The Democrats are raping the Republicans.
[02:18:31.874 --> 02:18:33.756]  Because at some point someone has to make a determination.
[02:18:33.836 --> 02:18:39.540]  What's the difference between, you know, misinformation from abroad and differences of opinion within the United States?
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:40.280]  Yeah, and that's happening here.
[02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:42.682]  It's a very fine line, and that's something we need to be careful about.
[02:18:42.702 --> 02:18:43.903]  We don't overreach in that direction.
[02:18:43.963 --> 02:18:45.564]  But then he doesn't know about InfoWorks being banned.
[02:18:46.044 --> 02:18:47.504]  He doesn't know about the top three story in the country.
[02:18:47.524 --> 02:18:49.765]  I wonder why Rubio got so mad at me and threatened me physically.
[02:18:49.785 --> 02:18:50.005]  Poor Rubio.
[02:18:50.025 --> 02:18:50.345]  Oh yeah.
[02:18:50.425 --> 02:18:51.285]  Look at this little frat boy.
[02:18:51.305 --> 02:18:51.585]  So cool.
[02:18:51.605 --> 02:18:52.265]  Back to your bath house.
[02:19:14.465 --> 02:19:15.165]  I don't like Rubio.
[02:19:15.185 --> 02:19:16.506]  I don't agree with his politics.
[02:19:16.546 --> 02:19:21.048]  But with that said, when he said, I'm not going to arrest you, I'm going to handle it myself.
[02:19:35.596 --> 02:19:37.036]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:19:37.056 --> 02:19:49.440]  There's got to be some sort of security there that's stopping him from actually... I mean, look, he's a member of the press.
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:50.700]  He's insane.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:53.280]  He is insane.
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:55.101]  He is an absolute security risk.
[02:20:06.235 --> 02:20:08.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.037 --> 02:20:16.257]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:16.317 --> 02:20:18.517]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.582 --> 02:20:38.289]  Well, Clyde Lewis is in one of the top 10 talk show hosts in the U.S.
[02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:41.596]  And he's the big lead-in to Coast to Coast to Him with George Norring.
[02:20:41.696 --> 02:20:44.982]  Wildly successful broadcasts on, what is it, 400 stations?
[02:20:45.002 --> 02:20:45.563]  We can ask him.
[02:20:45.624 --> 02:20:46.545]  I know it's everywhere I listen.
[02:20:47.958 --> 02:20:49.319]  He's got GroundZeroMedia.org.
[02:20:49.359 --> 02:20:51.040]  He's a filmmaker, actor, you name it.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:54.062]  But again, I was really impressed by his knowledge of Deep State.
[02:20:54.082 --> 02:20:57.044]  I'd forgotten a lot of the stuff he brought up, and I didn't know about some of it, looked it up.
[02:20:57.064 --> 02:21:01.486]  I was like, wow, because it makes me feel good that somebody's out there that knows as much as I do or more.
[02:21:01.947 --> 02:21:05.209]  But he's dumping into 9-11, 17-year anniversary, which is good.
[02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:10.231]  Well, I mean, 84% of people in the United States question
[02:21:32.992 --> 02:21:34.033]  The 9-11 attacks.
[02:21:34.333 --> 02:21:45.279]  And inside job or not, it's an inside jab is what it is that people like you and me and others who have been doing the hard work to try and uncover the truth.
[02:21:45.299 --> 02:21:50.842]  You know, it took $30 million to actually investigate the Quentin Lewinsky scam.
[02:21:52.957 --> 02:21:53.278]  Okay.
[02:21:54.299 --> 02:21:55.680]  It was what?
[02:21:56.201 --> 02:21:59.324]  Iran-Contra was $35 million to investigate.
[02:22:00.565 --> 02:22:03.769]  I think it was like $12 million for the Shuttle Columbia investigation.
[02:22:03.789 --> 02:22:08.814]  $3 million was allotted to investigate the 9-11 attacks.
[02:22:09.094 --> 02:22:09.835]  $3 million.
[02:22:10.335 --> 02:22:14.560]  And then Congress had to ask for another $11 million to investigate.
[02:22:16.349 --> 02:22:25.034]  So just the idea of a pittance of three million dollars to investigate the 9-11 attacks I think is embarrassing for the country.
[02:22:25.514 --> 02:22:34.199]  And I wanted to kind of do something while I have the opportunity and I wanted to just kind of read off some names for you.
[02:22:34.219 --> 02:22:40.923]  I know today's a day for reading off names and I just wanted to, I have them up here on my screen, I want to read them for everybody.
[02:22:41.653 --> 02:23:09.629]  Elliot Abrams, Gary Bauer, William J. Bennett, Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, Elliot Cohen, Midge Dechter, Paula Dobriansky, Steve Forbes, Aaron Friedberg, Francis Fukuyama, Frank Gaffney, Fred Eichel, Donald Kagan, Zalmay Khalizad, Louis Scooter Libby, Norman Podhorts, Dan Quayle, Peter W. Rodman, Steven P. Rosen, Henry S. Rowan, Donald Rumsfeld, Vin Weaver, George Weigel, and Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:23:10.282 --> 02:23:12.624]  You know, they read the names of the dead today at 9-11.
[02:23:12.684 --> 02:23:28.417]  I read the names responsible for 9-11 because they were the ones that signed their names to that Project for the New American Century, that letter of intent where they wanted a new Pearl Harbor in order to get the American people involved in wanting two wars that we fought in the Middle East because of 9-11.
[02:23:29.438 --> 02:23:36.043]  They're the ones that told everybody that we should not believe outrageous conspiracy theories with regard to 9-11.
[02:23:36.463 --> 02:23:56.958]  These are the things that are, in my opinion, when Barack Obama became president, he had the opportunity to actually go and find these men and question them about their involvement and what they knew and why and how it was organized in order to bring us to these wars.
[02:23:57.278 --> 02:23:57.758]  We can do that.
[02:23:58.198 --> 02:23:58.538]  Why?
[02:23:58.999 --> 02:24:17.625]  Because he's just another one of those Warhawk freaks that certainly, if you look at what happened at the John McCain funeral, every one of those people who spoke at the John McCain funeral were all the Warhawks and Warlords and ass kissers who've been around forever.
[02:24:17.985 --> 02:24:20.126]  And I knew at the minute that Henry Kissinger stood up.
[02:24:20.186 --> 02:24:22.147]  And by the way, while we're thinking of 9-11 today,
[02:24:23.507 --> 02:24:33.055]  9-11 1973 where Henry Kissinger was involved with the situation in South America where they purged and killed many people there as well.
[02:24:36.057 --> 02:24:37.198]  You've got the floor my friend.
[02:24:37.218 --> 02:24:42.242]  I want to play a clip since you mentioned him of Trump a few days after 9-11 on local news.
[02:24:42.783 --> 02:24:52.570]  There's three different clips of this on him on different local TV stations talking about how there had to be bombs in the buildings showing how dialed in Trump was even 17 years ago.
[02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.971]  Here it is.
[02:24:54.485 --> 02:24:55.785]  Well, I've never seen anything like it.
[02:24:55.865 --> 02:24:59.767]  I've seen two huge 110-story buildings that are reduced to rubble.
[02:25:00.687 --> 02:25:02.368]  Thousands and thousands of lives.
[02:25:02.388 --> 02:25:04.888]  I just got to see something that I've never seen before.
[02:25:05.569 --> 02:25:12.691]  I have hundreds of men inside working right now, and we're bringing down another 125 in a little while, and they've never done work like this before.
[02:25:12.851 --> 02:25:18.273]  And they're hard-working people, but they've never seen anything like it, and they've never done work like this before.
[02:25:18.333 --> 02:25:18.793]  It's terrible.
[02:25:19.545 --> 02:25:21.205]  Tell me what it's like at Ground Zero.
[02:25:21.245 --> 02:25:24.366]  Tell me about the workers that you saw and what they're doing there.
[02:25:24.786 --> 02:25:32.808]  Well, not only is it devastation, but it's very dangerous because every few minutes a whistle would go off and everybody would just run because you have all the buildings around you.
[02:25:32.828 --> 02:25:34.108]  This is an important clip.
[02:25:34.348 --> 02:25:34.808]  Stop it.
[02:25:34.828 --> 02:25:35.349]  Stop the clip.
[02:25:36.149 --> 02:25:38.389]  There are three clips of him talking about bombs in the buildings.
[02:25:38.569 --> 02:25:40.210]  We're going to play those before this hour is over.
[02:25:40.730 --> 02:25:41.730]  Or I'm going to go jump off a cliff.
[02:25:42.682 --> 02:25:46.766]  Okay, because anybody can type into a search engine, Donald Trump talks about bombs in the buildings, you'll get it.
[02:25:47.126 --> 02:25:47.726]  That's how you get it.
[02:25:47.746 --> 02:25:48.987]  So we're going to give you that clip.
[02:25:49.568 --> 02:25:52.751]  Going back to Clyde Lewis of GroundZeroMedia.org.
[02:25:54.012 --> 02:25:58.976]  Again, 17 years later, they use it to take our liberties, our freedoms, Al-Qaeda, ISIS is stronger than ever.
[02:26:00.698 --> 02:26:02.459]  Who do you think the real geopolitical players are?
[02:26:04.941 --> 02:26:07.063]  The real geopolitical players in what sense?
[02:26:07.503 --> 02:26:10.266]  I mean, who are the real power players in the world manipulating all this?
[02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:15.210]  Well, I would say that there are a lot behind the scenes who always seem to poke their heads in.
[02:26:15.250 --> 02:26:19.152]  I mean, when Zbigniew Brzezinski was alive, I often pointed to him as one of the players.
[02:26:19.192 --> 02:26:22.654]  He was the guy that negotiated a lot of things with Osama bin Laden.
[02:26:22.694 --> 02:26:26.215]  Of course, the Afghanistan problem, Russia, all brought in.
[02:26:26.275 --> 02:26:31.237]  Other power players include Henry Kissinger, who still, I think, dictates from where he is in his office.
[02:26:31.297 --> 02:26:32.278]  No one knows what he does.
[02:26:32.318 --> 02:26:34.879]  He's a war criminal, and I think he needs to be brought to trial.
[02:26:35.479 --> 02:26:35.599]  Yes.
[02:26:58.005 --> 02:27:01.686]  Henry Kissinger did when he was involved as Secretary of State under Ford.
[02:27:02.066 --> 02:27:07.107]  He wanted to eliminate and starve American citizens, and he wanted to eliminate and starve countries.
[02:27:07.487 --> 02:27:11.028]  Because of population growth, he said the resources would be tapped.
[02:27:11.068 --> 02:27:20.970]  He said eventually what we'd have to do is we'd have to create some sort of a natural problem that would give us a reason to declare famine and declare resource wars.
[02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:22.851]  And I think climate change fits that.
[02:27:22.871 --> 02:27:24.491]  Sure, Kissinger wrote that famous
[02:27:25.251 --> 02:27:29.175]  State Department memorandum where he says we want to cause global famine to depopulate people.
[02:27:30.477 --> 02:27:40.987]  Yeah, I mean he said that the only way we'd be able to convince the American people that a famine was here was to come up with something that would be a natural reason why this is happening.
[02:27:41.348 --> 02:27:46.273]  And I think that the climate change people, and I want to tell you this too Alex,
[02:27:46.653 --> 02:27:51.438]  I mean, you're the first domino in effect to be censored and actually put in your place.
[02:27:51.498 --> 02:27:56.043]  The next people on board, I think, the next people to be removed from the Internet are climate change deniers.
[02:27:56.223 --> 02:27:57.224]  That's what they call them.
[02:27:57.524 --> 02:28:08.435]  I think people who use, you know, real science instead of pseudoscience and instead of what we call technocrat, bought-off science, I think those are going to be the next to be taken off the Internet.
[02:28:09.199 --> 02:28:16.465]  Alright, we come back with Clyde Lewis, one of the top syndicated hosts in the country, GroundZeroMedia.org, works with George Norian for Premier Radio Networks.
[02:28:17.006 --> 02:28:19.668]  When we come back, you can follow him on Twitter, at Clyde Lewis.
[02:28:21.009 --> 02:28:23.311]  I want to play the clip, we did find one of the clips.
[02:28:24.192 --> 02:28:26.954]  Thanks for the crew on the fly finding that, it's my fault, it's throwing these clips out.
[02:28:27.454 --> 02:28:36.202]  We're going to play Trump talking about bombs in the buildings, and we're going to finish up with 9-11, and segue 17 years later to what's happening with the media, the censorship,
[02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:39.831]  56 days out, what's going on?
[02:28:39.891 --> 02:28:41.171]  Why are things so crazy?
[02:28:41.832 --> 02:28:48.014]  We're going to discuss it all with Clyde Lewis straight ahead and talk about different factions in the government.
[02:28:48.294 --> 02:28:52.136]  What really is the deep state versus the shadow government?
[02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:53.477]  It's all defined straight ahead.
[02:28:53.897 --> 02:28:54.977]  Infowars.com.
[02:28:55.458 --> 02:28:56.518]  Newswars.com.
[02:28:56.938 --> 02:28:58.479]  Next year's news today.
[02:29:04.446 --> 02:29:14.776]  I think what Google and what others are doing, if you look at what's going on at Twitter, if you look at what's going on in Facebook, they better be careful because you can't do that to people.
[02:29:14.936 --> 02:29:15.437]  You can't do it.
[02:29:15.477 --> 02:29:22.703]  We have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in and you just can't do that.
[02:29:22.844 --> 02:29:25.926]  So I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook
[02:29:26.867 --> 02:29:30.831]  They're really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful.
[02:29:30.871 --> 02:29:34.434]  It's not fair to large portions of the population.
[02:29:34.614 --> 02:29:36.536]  And so you guys, I'll tell you this.
[02:29:36.796 --> 02:29:44.002]  I'd give us a 60-40 chance we win the midterms, and you guys get totally devastated and indicted for this, because the quarter's not being given now.
[02:29:44.022 --> 02:29:45.023]  You guys pushed too far.
[02:29:45.363 --> 02:29:46.885]  You went after Trump's family, all of it.
[02:29:47.782 --> 02:29:49.284]  When you're involved with the Russians, everything else.
[02:29:49.985 --> 02:29:57.875]  But even if you were to steal the election to get through, I've looked at every possible destination along your planned permutation.
[02:30:09.253 --> 02:30:13.314]  And I haven't even laughed because I know you don't like it because I can, you know, act just like the enemy.
[02:30:13.334 --> 02:30:16.535]  But the point is, is that you guys think you're gonna execute this.
[02:30:16.756 --> 02:30:18.296]  You're not gonna execute crap.
[02:30:19.516 --> 02:30:24.458]  And the globalists know I don't just make statements on air that aren't true or that aren't backed up.
[02:30:24.598 --> 02:30:26.359]  You are facing hammer war.
[02:30:26.479 --> 02:30:27.919]  You are bringing down the gates.
[02:30:27.999 --> 02:30:30.520]  You think taking down these controls is destroying us?
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:31.080]  You are removing
[02:30:38.143 --> 02:30:42.684]  We will visit judgment on you politically, economically, culturally, lawfully.
[02:30:43.624 --> 02:30:45.045]  That's why you're so scared of my voice.
[02:30:45.485 --> 02:30:47.005]  Because you know it's judgment.
[02:30:47.845 --> 02:30:48.906]  It's judgment day.
[02:30:49.746 --> 02:30:50.866]  Judgment day cometh.
[02:30:51.646 --> 02:30:53.647]  Judgment day is so close.
[02:30:54.147 --> 02:30:55.347]  And justice is good.
[02:30:55.787 --> 02:30:56.848]  Justice is right.
[02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:05.770]  We just want to have our families and live and have prosperity, but you've got to control the prosperity.
[02:31:12.057 --> 02:31:13.698]  Things will never run our lives.
[02:31:14.039 --> 02:31:18.102]  So now, you have summoned us to destroy you politically.
[02:31:18.943 --> 02:31:25.288]  You have gone to the altar, and you've prayed on gods, ancient gods.
[02:31:25.788 --> 02:31:28.531]  You've summoned the Titans, and they will arrive.
[02:31:32.734 --> 02:31:36.436]  Super silver wound gel uses silver salt technology.
[02:31:36.717 --> 02:31:40.139]  There's been extensive research on silver salt technology.
[02:31:40.499 --> 02:31:49.907]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity.
[02:31:50.547 --> 02:31:53.968]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[02:31:54.308 --> 02:31:59.270]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[02:31:59.330 --> 02:32:01.690]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[02:32:01.970 --> 02:32:06.512]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[02:32:06.612 --> 02:32:07.232]  Ah, you don't want that.
[02:32:07.632 --> 02:32:11.434]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[02:32:11.654 --> 02:32:14.316]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[02:32:14.576 --> 02:32:17.898]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[02:32:18.258 --> 02:32:23.561]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[02:32:23.642 --> 02:32:27.724]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[02:32:28.636 --> 02:32:31.577]  Super silver wound gel.
[02:32:32.417 --> 02:32:36.138]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:32:36.298 --> 02:32:41.359]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[02:33:06.276 --> 02:33:08.919]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.172 --> 02:33:20.215]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:20.315 --> 02:33:22.540]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:46.195 --> 02:33:50.639]  So here is the President, just days after 9-11, on local TV.
[02:33:50.719 --> 02:33:59.367]  There's three of these clips, but I'll play one, talking about how he knows the architect, how there were bombs in the buildings, which we now have local news admitting there were bombs in Building 7 and Building 6.
[02:33:59.687 --> 02:34:05.653]  We'll get Clyde Lewis, the expert on this, to comment on it in a moment and then move forward into the current situation, but here it is.
[02:34:06.596 --> 02:34:07.717]  It was an architectural defect.
[02:34:07.737 --> 02:34:10.998]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[02:34:11.018 --> 02:34:12.999]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[02:34:13.039 --> 02:34:15.860]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[02:34:16.421 --> 02:34:17.581]  And it withstood that.
[02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:19.262]  And I got to see that area.
[02:34:20.021 --> 02:34:26.665]  About three or four days after it took place, because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour, because he did the building.
[02:34:26.805 --> 02:34:28.006]  And I said, I can't believe it.
[02:34:28.026 --> 02:34:32.088]  The building was standing solid, and half of the columns were blown out.
[02:34:32.108 --> 02:34:35.230]  I mean, so, this was an unbelievably powerful building.
[02:34:35.951 --> 02:34:39.773]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[02:34:39.833 --> 02:34:42.815]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows,
[02:34:43.408 --> 02:34:46.350]  Is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:47.771]  You had the steel on the outside of the building.
[02:34:48.251 --> 02:34:51.354]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams.
[02:34:51.914 --> 02:34:56.037]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[02:34:56.881 --> 02:35:00.944]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[02:35:01.024 --> 02:35:06.428]  I think you, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow, and in between was this heavy steel.
[02:35:06.528 --> 02:35:14.915]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through this steel?
[02:35:15.475 --> 02:35:21.600]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine
[02:35:22.121 --> 02:35:23.863]  Anything being able to go through that wall.
[02:35:24.224 --> 02:35:27.690]  Most buildings are built with the steelers on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:34.160]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have, and it was almost just like a can of soup.
[02:35:36.542 --> 02:35:40.005]  So, all I did, like everybody else, was see all this at the time.
[02:35:40.245 --> 02:35:46.190]  I heard CBS Radio say that they were going to blow up 7, and then I reported it.
[02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:50.714]  The media said I was crazy, but the years later, the audio, it's all online, came out.
[02:35:50.794 --> 02:35:57.319]  So, Clyde Lewis has been on top of this for a long time, syndicated talk show host on the top of the country, GroundZeroMedia.org.
[02:35:57.439 --> 02:35:59.001]  I want to put bookends on this and move into the
[02:35:59.421 --> 02:35:59.943]  We're good to go.
[02:36:11.485 --> 02:36:12.805]  Again, I don't want to be sensational.
[02:36:13.125 --> 02:36:16.726]  I was on over 100 radio stations, which was a lot for me, on 9-11.
[02:36:18.167 --> 02:36:19.007]  Bashing Bill Clinton.
[02:36:19.107 --> 02:36:20.387]  I was like 27 years old.
[02:36:20.647 --> 02:36:24.148]  Huge success, bringing in millions of dollars a year to build an operation.
[02:36:24.248 --> 02:36:25.069]  I didn't want to go on air.
[02:36:25.129 --> 02:36:25.809]  It was an inside job.
[02:36:25.849 --> 02:36:27.009]  I lost 70 plus stations.
[02:36:27.529 --> 02:36:30.130]  I went from like 100 and something down to like, you know,
[02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.810]  30-something.
[02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:35.771]  But I had to report what I heard, and then thank God the Internet Archives got uploaded later.
[02:36:35.811 --> 02:36:39.072]  Back then there was Internet Archives, and there was all these newscasts saying what I'd heard.
[02:36:39.512 --> 02:36:40.312]  You heard that too.
[02:36:40.372 --> 02:36:42.313]  So, I didn't say America did it.
[02:36:42.333 --> 02:36:44.193]  They always said, oh, you say firefighters blew it up.
[02:36:44.273 --> 02:36:44.433]  No.
[02:36:44.753 --> 02:36:45.633]  Criminal elements.
[02:36:45.833 --> 02:36:46.873]  We don't know what happened.
[02:36:47.274 --> 02:36:48.374]  We just know we're being lied to.
[02:36:48.414 --> 02:36:51.835]  So, you talk about Building 6, that's a key part too nobody talks about.
[02:36:52.215 --> 02:36:53.375]  So let's finish up on 9-11, Clyde Lewis.
[02:36:55.356 --> 02:37:11.054]  Well, the reason why Building 6 is avoided is because in the whole melee, if you look back at the video, the first plane entering the tower, you'll notice there's an explosion just halfway down from the tower that happens before the plane hits.
[02:37:11.774 --> 02:37:14.076]  And what that is, is that's Building 6 being detonated.
[02:37:14.897 --> 02:37:29.590]  And I remember wondering why I was seeing explosive, at least some smoke coming up from the bottom of the tower instead of seeing it happen on the outside.
[02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:35.055]  But yeah, the minute the plane goes in, or just before, in fact, it was 9-0-4 when Building 6 exploded.
[02:37:35.075 --> 02:37:37.357]  Oh, Building 6 blows out across the street!
[02:37:38.462 --> 02:37:39.142]  Yes, it does.
[02:37:39.203 --> 02:37:55.254]  If you remember the video, remember the video, and maybe for those of you that can go and find it online if there is any of it left, watch the plane before it enters into the tower, and you will see that there's an explosion prior to the main explosion above, and that is Building 6.
[02:37:55.734 --> 02:37:56.655]  They exploded it.
[02:37:57.055 --> 02:37:57.955]  They blew it up.
[02:37:58.456 --> 02:38:05.100]  In fact, there was nothing left of it when they showed the aerial view of Ground Zero.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:05.781]  It was gone.
[02:38:06.605 --> 02:38:14.827]  And what they don't tell you about Building 6 is that it was actually the Export-Import Bank was in that building.
[02:38:15.347 --> 02:38:26.489]  And what the Export-Import Bank does, it basically had all of the records, probably, that provided the investment capital for the attacks on the United States.
[02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:31.910]  And so, you know, they run that money through the Export-Import Bank.
[02:38:32.751 --> 02:38:39.241]  And so they would have been able to trace all that money to those money and investments and whatever it was it took to blow up.
[02:38:39.802 --> 02:38:40.684]  The shadow government.
[02:38:40.744 --> 02:38:41.485]  And let's expand.
[02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:43.428]  Building 7 had the FBI, the CIA.
[02:38:43.448 --> 02:38:44.449]  Yeah, there's Building 6.
[02:38:44.490 --> 02:38:45.511]  They were all based in that too.
[02:38:49.654 --> 02:38:54.959]  That's the thing is that you go back to how the media exchange that has been forgotten since 9-11.
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:39:06.110]  The people involved that were the criminal element or at least the alleged criminal element, we can't know for sure unless we have a trial, but we didn't have a trial because Barack Obama wouldn't have one, although he said he was going to.
[02:39:06.850 --> 02:39:08.051]  Investigate 9-11.
[02:39:08.091 --> 02:39:13.414]  We had, like I said, it was $30 million to invest to investigate the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
[02:39:13.474 --> 02:39:19.778]  I mean, a state on address had more importance to the American people financially than the lives were lost.
[02:39:19.898 --> 02:39:20.258]  Exactly.
[02:39:20.298 --> 02:39:23.320]  How do you spend $30 million on him doing perverted stuff with cigars?
[02:39:24.747 --> 02:39:25.548]  Yeah, see, that's the thing.
[02:39:25.568 --> 02:39:28.070]  It was a $30 million investigation.
[02:39:28.410 --> 02:39:30.973]  I'm sure there's more investigation going into Russian meddling.
[02:39:31.033 --> 02:39:39.360]  They don't tell us about the money that is going into these investigations and the time spent to chase after the real conspiracy theory.
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:42.423]  I think Mueller's up, last time I heard, to like $80-something million.
[02:39:44.405 --> 02:39:44.805]  $80 million?
[02:39:45.466 --> 02:39:45.586]  Yeah.
[02:39:47.948 --> 02:39:50.368]  $15 million actually at end for 9-11.
[02:39:51.409 --> 02:39:52.649]  $15 million, okay?
[02:39:53.070 --> 02:39:55.470]  I mean, at first it was $3 million, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:56.011 --> 02:40:04.234]  $3 million to investigate the dead, to investigate who was responsible, and by the end of the day we knew who was responsible by some reason.
[02:40:04.274 --> 02:40:05.334]  We didn't investigate.
[02:40:05.354 --> 02:40:08.215]  Oh, they said two hours later it was bin Laden.
[02:40:09.576 --> 02:40:11.337]  No, actually they said it was Saddam Hussein.
[02:40:11.597 --> 02:40:12.377]  You're right, you're right.
[02:40:13.453 --> 02:40:21.913]  They said first it was Saddam Hussein and then they changed their tune and said it was Osama Bin Laden because both Tom Brokaw, even Dick Cheney said it wasn't Osama Bin Laden.
[02:40:22.623 --> 02:40:39.828]  And I remember something about Donald Rumsfeld saying that it was Saddam Hussein, he was the first suspect, and then they eliminated that, went with the Osama Bin Laden story, and then they found weapons of mass destruction, and then of course they had an excuse to go after Saddam Hussein because they wanted to expand the entire Middle East.
[02:40:39.848 --> 02:40:42.868]  Now let's be clear, we're not saying Saddam's good, we're not saying Al-Qaeda's good.
[02:40:43.589 --> 02:40:48.190]  The point is, is that just what you saw in the Arab Spring, aiding the very groups, this was part of a larger plan.
[02:40:49.755 --> 02:40:51.677]  Well, they were the best enemies the CIA could buy.
[02:40:51.697 --> 02:40:52.737]  They were both blowbacks.
[02:40:52.797 --> 02:41:05.928]  I mean, you know that if you go online, you can see hands being shaken for situations between Rumsfeld, another cleanup situation, where they're going after their biggest asset, Saddam Hussein, and using him for the war against Iran.
[02:41:06.208 --> 02:41:11.192]  And then, of course, Osama bin Laden was key in bringing down the Russians during that war.
[02:41:11.552 --> 02:41:13.654]  Of course, Zbigniew Brzezinski organizing that.
[02:41:13.954 --> 02:41:14.694]  The Grand Chessboard.
[02:41:15.895 --> 02:41:17.797]  Let's expand on that.
[02:41:17.877 --> 02:41:29.905]  I was told, and you can read the PNAC says, oh we're going to do this to secure America, but then they use it to get rid of non-radicals and put in super radicals to collapse into Europe with the whole Islamic invasion plan.
[02:41:30.205 --> 02:41:33.127]  What do you think about the current globalist plan working with radical Islam?
[02:41:34.628 --> 02:41:42.414]  Well, I think it's confusing to the American people when you have the globalists, including John McCain, before he passed away, basically making deals with the enemy.
[02:41:42.474 --> 02:41:48.799]  I mean, why is it all of a sudden, you know, we're working with the enemy because we have a big chub for Syria?
[02:41:48.819 --> 02:41:58.987]  It doesn't make sense to me, you know, that we are told, well, by the way, the enemy that was responsible for 9-11 is now fighting side by side with us, and we're giving them weapons,
[02:41:59.167 --> 02:42:00.588]  Why are they silencing everybody now?
[02:42:19.318 --> 02:42:20.019]  That's crazy.
[02:42:20.059 --> 02:42:20.980]  I think I know what it is.
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:23.382]  And it says so in the Project for a New American Century.
[02:42:23.402 --> 02:42:25.144]  It's a biological attack on the United States.
[02:42:25.464 --> 02:42:25.765]  I agree.
[02:42:25.785 --> 02:42:28.607]  Because let me tell you, I was on with Clyde Lewis, and I'm not just saying this.
[02:42:28.627 --> 02:42:29.648]  People know I don't just say this.
[02:42:30.149 --> 02:42:33.933]  I was on for three hours with him, from like 10 at night to 1 in the morning.
[02:42:35.014 --> 02:42:37.256]  And I literally couldn't go to sleep.
[02:42:37.336 --> 02:42:38.397]  And I was up at 5 a.m.
[02:42:38.417 --> 02:42:38.738]  that day.
[02:42:38.758 --> 02:42:39.638]  I was exhausted.
[02:42:39.718 --> 02:42:40.880]  I couldn't go to sleep.
[02:42:42.225 --> 02:42:43.346]  And Clyde just did 9-11.
[02:42:43.366 --> 02:42:43.706]  That's great.
[02:42:43.726 --> 02:42:44.487]  He did what he wanted to do.
[02:42:44.507 --> 02:42:54.055]  He's got to come back then tomorrow or something and do what he said that night because he laid out everything and I was getting chills in the middle of the night even though I was exhausted.
[02:42:54.095 --> 02:42:55.096]  I was getting chills.
[02:42:55.757 --> 02:42:56.277]  Chills!
[02:42:56.738 --> 02:42:59.220]  So I want him to say what he gave me the chills when we come back.
[02:43:02.853 --> 02:43:10.121]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:43:10.501 --> 02:43:17.970]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:21.514]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:22.134 --> 02:43:26.398]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:26.779 --> 02:43:30.702]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:30.902 --> 02:43:33.625]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:34.065 --> 02:43:38.349]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:38.830 --> 02:43:41.833]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:42.273 --> 02:43:57.129]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:43:57.370 --> 02:43:58.651]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:43:58.891 --> 02:44:01.254]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:44:04.488 --> 02:44:06.428]  Joining us is George Norrie.
[02:44:06.848 --> 02:44:10.289]  And, of course, you hear him coast to coast on over 650 radio stations.
[02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:13.350]  He's also on in Europe and Canada and Guam.
[02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:14.450]  He's one of the only U.S.
[02:44:14.490 --> 02:44:17.370]  shows that's been exported worldwide with great success.
[02:44:17.410 --> 02:44:22.651]  The reason I love George is he was the only guy in 2003 that had the guts to put us on here.
[02:44:22.751 --> 02:44:24.451]  And so he's a real trailblazer.
[02:44:24.531 --> 02:44:29.052]  George, you're a newsman, you know, in your own right, three-time Emmy Award-winning newsman.
[02:44:29.332 --> 02:44:32.913]  I mean, this is Eisenhower, Clinton, Bush era.
[02:44:33.533 --> 02:44:37.898]  When thousands come across a day, sometimes whole groups, no one knows who's who.
[02:44:37.938 --> 02:44:39.539]  They put adults in one area, kids in another.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:42.983]  I mean, they're saying it's concentration camp, the kids are there.
[02:44:43.003 --> 02:44:46.406]  You know, they're saying Trump's a Nazi, Hayden is.
[02:44:47.027 --> 02:44:47.988]  I mean, I've got a memory.
[02:44:48.048 --> 02:44:50.110]  This is all, Obama did all this too.
[02:44:50.130 --> 02:44:52.673]  What do you think's going on there, or do you disagree with me?
[02:44:52.793 --> 02:44:56.794]  Well, first of all, Alex, we're talking about illegal immigration.
[02:44:56.934 --> 02:44:59.215]  Violation of American law.
[02:44:59.515 --> 02:45:01.676]  And we have to keep our borders tight.
[02:45:02.156 --> 02:45:03.916]  I mean, that's just a sad way to do it.
[02:45:03.976 --> 02:45:09.378]  Now, on the other hand, and this is so important that everybody understands this, people want a better living.
[02:45:09.998 --> 02:45:13.599]  They want to get out of the country they're in because their life is not working.
[02:45:13.639 --> 02:45:14.899]  They're not making any money.
[02:45:14.959 --> 02:45:16.380]  Their lifestyle is horrible.
[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:21.741]  I can understand that it's the saddest, saddest thing that we have to go through as a nation.
[02:45:21.761 --> 02:45:27.363]  To have to deny people the right to come through into our country which is wonderful and perfect.
[02:45:27.403 --> 02:45:28.884]  We're good to go.
[02:45:48.577 --> 02:45:51.039]  In some cases, they're not really family.
[02:45:51.059 --> 02:45:52.821]  They're just kids coming over with them.
[02:45:53.261 --> 02:45:56.744]  Family members are using these kids to get across the border.
[02:45:57.484 --> 02:46:05.891]  But, you can't put, sadly enough, you can't put kids in these areas that you've got the adults hold up.
[02:46:06.832 --> 02:46:07.973]  It's just unhealthy.
[02:46:08.053 --> 02:46:09.154]  It's just not good.
[02:46:09.994 --> 02:46:11.616]  It's a horrible situation.
[02:46:11.756 --> 02:46:12.857]  There are no winners here.
[02:46:13.577 --> 02:46:19.560]  We as a country, we don't win and these people who are coming across the border don't win.
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:25.282]  We've got to do something a little better with legal immigration, maybe let more people in.
[02:46:26.423 --> 02:46:35.407]  We have to definitely check them all out because there are a lot of criminals that come across the border and we don't want anything to do with them.
[02:46:35.487 --> 02:46:37.888]  It's a disaster, but
[02:46:38.768 --> 02:46:41.670]  Um, something's got to be done worldwide.
[02:46:41.730 --> 02:46:43.551]  I mean, these are huge problems.
[02:46:44.292 --> 02:46:47.774]  And, uh, you know, we have to deal with it as a nation.
[02:46:47.874 --> 02:46:54.558]  Exactly, but if the first world just opens itself up to six and a half billion people in the third world, we know it's a giant sucking sound.
[02:46:54.618 --> 02:46:58.761]  It will make us third world as well, and it will be a total global disaster.
[02:47:05.689 --> 02:47:08.291]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:35.939 --> 02:47:39.366]  Alright, groundzeromedia.com.
[02:47:39.386 --> 02:47:42.292]  We'll do five minutes to the next hour and he's agreed to come back next week.
[02:47:42.432 --> 02:47:45.118]  And look, I'm glad, as a host, he went where he wanted to go.
[02:47:45.158 --> 02:47:45.899]  I wanted him on about...
[02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:48.511]  I don't like pre-interview people.
[02:47:48.531 --> 02:47:58.456]  I want him on about what he laid out about the internet kill switch and the deep state, because I study this stuff all the time, and then he was saying stuff I heard no one else ever say, but stuff I'd read, and I was like, God, I forgot that.
[02:47:58.476 --> 02:47:59.076]  I forgot this.
[02:47:59.116 --> 02:47:59.476]  I forgot.
[02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:01.317]  Because you think I know all this stuff, folks.
[02:48:01.357 --> 02:48:03.478]  I've forgotten way more than I ever talk about on air.
[02:48:03.498 --> 02:48:04.719]  So he laid it out.
[02:48:05.079 --> 02:48:05.699]  He's got articles.
[02:48:05.759 --> 02:48:06.880]  It's at groundzeromedia.org.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:07.680]  You need to go get.
[02:48:08.081 --> 02:48:09.962]  And thank God there's still talk radio, because...
[02:48:11.102 --> 02:48:17.947]  As they censor us in real media, as they try to shut us down on the internet, we're still on AM, FM, TVs exploding.
[02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:20.569]  We've gained like 20 big stations the last few weeks.
[02:48:20.889 --> 02:48:22.250]  That'll be announcing in the next few days.
[02:48:23.390 --> 02:48:24.311]  So, good news.
[02:48:24.371 --> 02:48:25.172]  America's awake.
[02:48:25.292 --> 02:48:25.832]  It's upset.
[02:48:26.232 --> 02:48:27.113]  Sponsorship's there.
[02:48:27.153 --> 02:48:27.773]  You're supporting us.
[02:48:27.793 --> 02:48:37.020]  Speaking of that, we had to end the Bone Broth Special and the Body Special Ultimate Turmeric Formula because the Ultimate Turmeric Formula will sell out in the next week, so it's back to regular price.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:38.661]  Won't be back until close to Christmas.
[02:48:39.401 --> 02:48:41.562]  Uh, or maybe next month if we're lucky, we're trying.
[02:48:41.902 --> 02:48:43.183]  But it's really hard to produce.
[02:48:43.483 --> 02:48:46.044]  Uh, the bone broth, you know, that we had in that special, a bunch of others.
[02:48:46.564 --> 02:48:49.445]  We have X2, that is a deep earth crystal source of iodine.
[02:48:49.885 --> 02:48:51.206]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[02:48:51.246 --> 02:48:52.166]  This is the best iodine.
[02:48:52.426 --> 02:48:56.368]  But I have trouble getting it from the oil companies, because it's gotten between 7 and 11,000 feet.
[02:48:57.528 --> 02:49:01.270]  And the price has gone up and up and up, and I've kept the price the same to you, so I broke the contract.
[02:49:02.588 --> 02:49:03.429]  The new contract came up.
[02:49:03.509 --> 02:49:04.169]  I did not do it.
[02:49:04.509 --> 02:49:06.590]  X2, the only product like it in the world, is gone.
[02:49:07.071 --> 02:49:08.852]  What we have now on InfoWarsTore.com is it.
[02:49:09.452 --> 02:49:10.573]  I'm playing guts ball.
[02:49:10.593 --> 02:49:12.094]  I got some other firms I'm looking at.
[02:49:12.134 --> 02:49:12.854]  I'm having it tested.
[02:49:12.874 --> 02:49:13.615]  We'll see what happens.
[02:49:14.155 --> 02:49:16.497]  I've got another plan, but this is amazing.
[02:49:16.557 --> 02:49:18.358]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:18.438 --> 02:49:19.458]  But whatever you do,
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:25.262]  We're under attack because we promote Americana and the truth.
[02:49:25.282 --> 02:49:28.825]  It doesn't mean, like I'm telling Clyde Lewis, I don't know what happened on 9-11.
[02:49:29.205 --> 02:49:35.810]  I just know I'm driving down the road, CBS says they're going to blow up Building 7, and then they blow the damn thing up, and the media says I lied.
[02:49:36.110 --> 02:49:38.132]  Years later, they release the CBS tapes.
[02:49:39.252 --> 02:49:40.493]  And then they attack me even more.
[02:49:41.134 --> 02:49:47.118]  So, and then the FBI comes out and says we were ordered to stand down, and then NORAD tapes are released, and they're like, is this a drill?
[02:49:49.451 --> 02:49:50.892]  I appreciate Clyde coming to my defense.
[02:49:50.932 --> 02:49:55.034]  I wanted him on about the other issue today, but I'm glad he brought this up.
[02:49:55.054 --> 02:49:57.976]  Clyde, in the eight minutes we have now and five minutes after this, then you've got to go.
[02:49:57.996 --> 02:50:01.718]  We've got Paul Watson coming up with a guy that they're now banning books on Amazon.
[02:50:01.758 --> 02:50:02.659]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:08.482]  So next time I want to speak about censorship with you and why you think it's happening, but in three hours, notice I hardly ever shut up.
[02:50:09.183 --> 02:50:11.825]  You probably talk more than me on your own show because you were on fire that night.
[02:50:12.345 --> 02:50:15.267]  Give us some of that fire, what you shed, because I've got...
[02:50:16.127 --> 02:50:20.512]  All the articles that back up what you say about the shadow government, the stay-behind groups.
[02:50:21.273 --> 02:50:23.936]  We know there's groups rebelling against Trump, not doing what he says.
[02:50:24.096 --> 02:50:24.857]  Who's behind it?
[02:50:25.197 --> 02:50:26.478]  How it got set up by Obama.
[02:50:26.498 --> 02:50:26.979]  Break that down.
[02:50:28.416 --> 02:50:37.019]  Well, back in 2015, I made the comment that there were some movements being made that were mimicking what I would call the Dirty War that happened in Argentina.
[02:50:37.039 --> 02:50:48.822]  It was a similar thing that started in 1973 on 9-11, where journalists, actors, comedians, musicians, they were all silenced through methods of intimidation, character assassination, and suspicious deaths.
[02:50:49.542 --> 02:50:53.646]  And when I made this statement, there were a lot of people that were leaving late night talk.
[02:50:53.746 --> 02:51:01.033]  Jon Stewart, David Letterman, everybody was just leaving and they were opening up for the new ones to take over.
[02:51:01.153 --> 02:51:06.738]  You know, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, Kimmel, all of them pretty much liberal.
[02:51:06.938 --> 02:51:09.020]  And they wanted to take over.
[02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:10.041]  And I'd forgotten that.
[02:51:10.081 --> 02:51:13.724]  There was a giant exodus and they said, I no longer have creative control.
[02:51:14.065 --> 02:51:14.805]  That was the beginning.
[02:51:14.825 --> 02:51:15.286]  So they left.
[02:51:16.758 --> 02:51:18.739]  Yeah, they were losing creative control of their shows.
[02:51:19.059 --> 02:51:20.220]  They knew what was going on.
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:21.181]  Something was moving in.
[02:51:21.201 --> 02:51:29.305]  And then, of course, Eric Holder said, well, you know, we're not yet in a time of war, but we're going to issue a statement in something called the Department of Defense Law of War Manual.
[02:51:29.605 --> 02:51:36.369]  And what we're going to talk about is unprivileged belligerence, which is probably the equivalent of a enemy combatant.
[02:51:36.749 --> 02:51:40.912]  And we're going to go in and we're going to basically evaluate
[02:51:41.372 --> 02:51:43.454]  Who are the spokespeople on the Internet?
[02:51:43.474 --> 02:51:46.156]  Who are the spokespeople who are in newsrooms?
[02:51:46.456 --> 02:51:52.681]  And what they wanted to do is they wanted to actually put together something called the Multimarket Study of Critical Information Needs.
[02:51:52.701 --> 02:51:58.486]  And what that was is they were going to go into newsrooms and they were going to ferret out those who were controversial.
[02:51:58.706 --> 02:52:13.093]  Who are the heavy hitters who wanted to basically upset the apple cart, if you will, with information that was going against what the mainstream framing was about using hypocognition, going in and saying, well, we're going to exclude certain things, exclude certain people.
[02:52:13.133 --> 02:52:14.973]  We're not going to pay attention to certain people.
[02:52:15.314 --> 02:52:19.055]  And so during the Obama administration, the FCC created this CIN.
[02:52:20.116 --> 02:52:26.839]  The purpose of the CIN, according to the FCC, was to ferret out information from television and radio broadcasters about the process.
[02:52:27.279 --> 02:52:27.760]  We're good to go.
[02:52:46.853 --> 02:52:47.674]  And let me stop you.
[02:52:47.714 --> 02:52:51.198]  When they had Jade Helm and claimed that I said there was going to be a huge invasion, I never said that.
[02:52:51.238 --> 02:52:58.145]  But Jade Helm, they later admitted, was about controlling the human domain and practicing taking over social media by the Pentagon, by Obama.
[02:52:59.706 --> 02:53:04.992]  Yeah, it was a way to take over social media and take over the internet in order to use it as a weapon.
[02:53:05.152 --> 02:53:07.174]  That was the whole idea, is they wanted to use it as a weapon.
[02:53:07.194 --> 02:53:08.836]  Controlling the human domain.
[02:53:10.004 --> 02:53:10.504]  Exactly.
[02:53:10.644 --> 02:53:17.368]  And the human domain was certainly on social networks and shaping, controlling the human domain was basically shaping the culture.
[02:53:17.708 --> 02:53:22.471]  That's what they wanted to do, was the idea of shaping the culture and preparing them, as I say, for the final blow.
[02:53:22.811 --> 02:53:30.635]  Preparing them for the moment where there will be a complete rebellion or those who will be fighting against the rebellion will be silenced.
[02:53:31.055 --> 02:53:31.436]  And so,
[02:53:32.136 --> 02:53:34.839]  And notice our videos on that have been killed by YouTube.
[02:53:34.899 --> 02:53:35.800]  I'm just showing this now.
[02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:37.882]  I've talked to special operations folks at Fort Bragg.
[02:53:38.202 --> 02:53:42.206]  The good news is they're aware of this now and it's kind of backfired.
[02:53:42.226 --> 02:53:46.390]  But I want to speak to you briefly about that because the good news is there's a rebellion.
[02:53:46.890 --> 02:53:47.451]  Do you agree with that?
[02:53:49.045 --> 02:53:53.969]  Well, yeah, I mean, there's a rebellion with those of us who are seeing what is going on.
[02:53:54.029 --> 02:54:01.516]  I mean, the media cannot say that they are objective when they most certainly say that they're part of the resistance.
[02:54:01.656 --> 02:54:02.476]  You can't do that.
[02:54:02.817 --> 02:54:05.199]  You can't say that you are objective.
[02:54:05.239 --> 02:54:07.841]  You can't say that you're balanced and unbiased.
[02:54:08.141 --> 02:54:08.501]  We're good to go.
[02:54:25.191 --> 02:54:50.093]  was already planning on going after people who are trying to tell the truth and what I say is that they 451'd you Alex meaning that it was like Fahrenheit 451 where the people pretended to police you and with the media pushing the issue that you're a weirdo whack job or whatever they're saying about you or you're heartless because of Sandy Hook or because you believe that 9-11 is an inside job
[02:54:50.593 --> 02:54:54.996]  All those things are there to destroy your character and erase you.
[02:54:55.056 --> 02:54:57.358]  Much like what they did in the times of Russia and the Soviet Union.
[02:54:57.398 --> 02:54:57.818]  No, that's right.
[02:54:57.918 --> 02:54:58.939]  So it's an unpersonning.
[02:54:58.979 --> 02:55:00.380]  So let me ask this question then.
[02:55:01.681 --> 02:55:02.461]  What do we do about it?
[02:55:02.481 --> 02:55:03.622]  Because I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[02:55:03.642 --> 02:55:04.102]  I've always said it.
[02:55:04.142 --> 02:55:05.483]  I had guests on, like you did, that questioned it.
[02:55:05.523 --> 02:55:07.945]  I played devil's advocate, said both sides, they clipped the tape.
[02:55:08.205 --> 02:55:09.806]  But even if I believe that, I have a right.
[02:55:10.867 --> 02:55:15.630]  So Trump comes in, Hillary loses, but the deep state just continued her plan.
[02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:16.351]  That's what we've learned.
[02:55:16.611 --> 02:55:17.832]  What does Trump do to counter that?
[02:55:19.508 --> 02:55:32.753]  Well, I mean, what Trump has to do is he has to go in and he has to say, he has to be point blank saying, we obviously have a group of individuals that are part of the resistance within the walls of the White House.
[02:55:33.153 --> 02:55:39.976]  This is a silent, soft coup and it's happening and I need to do things to protect myself and to protect this country and protect the White House.
[02:55:40.336 --> 02:55:45.258]  I mean, people like Maxine Waters saying impeach, impeach, impeach and harass and all this.
[02:55:45.558 --> 02:55:48.859]  You know, if Trump wanted to be nasty, which he hasn't been,
[02:55:49.239 --> 02:55:53.722]  He could basically pull a Woodrow Wilson on everybody and then basically put in sedition laws.
[02:55:54.143 --> 02:55:58.526]  In fact, if I was president, I probably would think about doing that.
[02:55:58.546 --> 02:56:00.867]  And by the way, you're a classical liberal like I am.
[02:56:00.967 --> 02:56:02.789]  These are foreign outside powers.
[02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:06.711]  Google won't work with the Pentagon, but they'll work with Chinese military.
[02:56:06.792 --> 02:56:07.192]  Exactly.
[02:56:07.452 --> 02:56:08.893]  This is a foreign globalist plan.
[02:56:09.133 --> 02:56:12.856]  The right response would be the Sedition Act, because this isn't citizens.
[02:56:13.176 --> 02:56:15.778]  This is an outside group trying to overthrow our republic.
[02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:19.488]  Yes, and it's the Chinese model they want to implement by 2030.
[02:56:19.948 --> 02:56:21.109]  It's the UN's plan.
[02:56:21.129 --> 02:56:23.071]  They've said it's the UN's plan from the very beginning.
[02:56:23.371 --> 02:56:33.959]  Xi Jinping said in his last, what was it, meeting they had, they said that our model of government is the model of government with the Internet of Things, 5G, all these things coming our way.
[02:56:34.179 --> 02:56:36.121]  And you look at what China's doing in the Movement Service.
[02:56:36.141 --> 02:56:37.442]  They've set up Skynet.
[02:56:37.542 --> 02:56:40.084]  They call it Skynet, surveilling everyone in real time.
[02:56:41.212 --> 02:56:42.493]  Yeah, and what?
[02:56:42.673 --> 02:56:45.434]  After you got thrown off the internet, what happened?
[02:56:46.234 --> 02:56:51.536]  Facebook said, well, we've got a social credit network that no one knows about.
[02:56:51.576 --> 02:56:53.637]  And we also have a hate scale that no one knows about.
[02:56:53.977 --> 02:56:55.098]  Just like what they have in China.
[02:56:55.178 --> 02:57:01.120]  I mean, they have the social... Oh, Zuckerberg went to China last year to learn how to do it?
[02:57:02.321 --> 02:57:02.601]  Yes.
[02:57:03.121 --> 02:57:04.822]  Yeah, I mean, it's all being implemented.
[02:57:04.922 --> 02:57:06.543]  Everything that China has, we're getting.
[02:57:06.863 --> 02:57:08.144]  And we're eventually going to have that.
[02:57:08.464 --> 02:57:12.986]  No, we don't need the Chinese to come with guns and taking over our country.
[02:57:13.006 --> 02:57:15.127]  No, they're economically taking over the culture.
[02:57:16.168 --> 02:57:16.828]  You're on fire.
[02:57:16.848 --> 02:57:21.991]  Stay there and come back and talk about this and what we did because they have killed five times the number Hitler has.
[02:57:22.651 --> 02:57:23.271]  It's happening.
[02:57:23.311 --> 02:57:24.892]  Clyde Lewis is on fire.
[02:57:24.912 --> 02:57:29.074]  You know how good it makes me feel that he's there and knows as much as I do or more?
[02:57:29.534 --> 02:57:30.495]  God, this is awesome.
[02:57:31.535 --> 02:57:34.798]  Info Wars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:57:34.838 --> 02:57:36.279]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:58:43.770 --> 02:58:46.331]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:58:47.071 --> 02:58:49.052]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[02:58:59.762 --> 02:59:00.282]  You're on the air.
[02:59:00.302 --> 02:59:01.123]  Thanks for holding.
[02:59:01.243 --> 02:59:02.343]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:59:02.523 --> 02:59:03.143]  Hey, brother.
[02:59:03.464 --> 02:59:03.804]  Good, man.
[02:59:03.824 --> 02:59:04.644]  Thank you for calling.
[02:59:04.724 --> 02:59:05.264]  Hey, hey.
[02:59:05.364 --> 02:59:09.786]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:59:09.986 --> 02:59:16.369]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:59:16.489 --> 02:59:18.209]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:59:18.289 --> 02:59:24.452]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:59:25.712 --> 02:59:26.713]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:59:26.773 --> 02:59:29.135]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:59:29.195 --> 02:59:30.716]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:59:31.096 --> 02:59:32.678]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:59:33.158 --> 02:59:33.899]  And exactly.
[02:59:33.919 --> 02:59:38.182]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:59:38.502 --> 02:59:38.782]  Boom!
[02:59:38.922 --> 02:59:41.765]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:59:41.805 --> 02:59:42.345]  It's amazing.
[02:59:42.385 --> 02:59:43.706]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:59:43.766 --> 02:59:46.648]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:58.672]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.194 --> 03:00:00.498]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:28.539 --> 03:00:30.000]  All right, well, he's on fire.
[03:00:30.020 --> 03:00:31.540]  Clyde Lewis knows his stuff.
[03:00:32.081 --> 03:00:34.081]  So just finish up the five minutes we have.
[03:00:34.162 --> 03:00:34.942]  Come back next week.
[03:00:35.002 --> 03:00:39.964]  You're on tonight, 10 o'clock central, with the whole great Premier Radio Network and George Norton and everybody else.
[03:00:41.405 --> 03:00:47.807]  Dealing with what we're dealing with here, Clyde Lewis, of Ground Zero Media dot org, they're making their move 56 days out.
[03:00:47.888 --> 03:00:53.130]  They're shutting down everybody, conservatives, real liberals, anybody that's independent.
[03:00:53.850 --> 03:00:54.811]  What do you think's happening?
[03:00:54.851 --> 03:00:55.551]  What does Trump need to do?
[03:00:57.324 --> 03:01:02.202]  Well, what I think is happening is that the globalists have this ideal.
[03:01:02.941 --> 03:01:19.736]  And the ideal was set in stone during the 2030 Summit when Xia Suking, with the UN, who was one of the re-designers of state socialism in China, spoke and said that this model would be used for smart cities and the future, and they wanted to implement it by 2030.
[03:01:19.776 --> 03:01:27.203]  They said it was a political move that would be very, very dangerous, that people would, if they had any idea what was going on, they would rise up.
[03:01:27.763 --> 03:01:37.047]  Well, the rising up is being taken down by these provisions that were put in play by Eric Holder and Barack Obama.
[03:01:37.567 --> 03:01:48.292]  And I think they did it because they were of the opinion that their globalist Patsy or their globalist Hillary Clinton would end up being president of the United States.
[03:01:48.312 --> 03:01:52.354]  They signed everything into law hoping that the next president would be part of this globalist agenda.
[03:01:52.834 --> 03:01:57.955]  The globalists made themselves obviously known during the McCain campaign.
[03:01:58.415 --> 03:02:02.036]  I think President Trump needs to put up parameters and protect himself.
[03:02:02.096 --> 03:02:20.741]  I think even though it looked like a narcissistic move on his part to protect himself, I feel he needs to be protected and he needs to start putting things in place to protect him, to protect the administration, and to also weed out and investigate and have his own investigation as to who the leakers are, as who the conspirators are.
[03:02:21.041 --> 03:02:21.641]  Because there is a
[03:02:21.681 --> 03:02:22.461]  It's a conspiracy.
[03:02:22.501 --> 03:02:26.743]  I mean, the whole idea of conspiracy theory is, you know, right.
[03:02:26.783 --> 03:02:28.483]  It's theory until proven otherwise.
[03:02:28.823 --> 03:02:30.584]  But there's always been a conspiracy.
[03:02:30.624 --> 03:02:34.105]  From the very beginning, our founding fathers were conspirators against the king.
[03:02:34.125 --> 03:02:36.966]  And we need to remember that there have always been conspirators.
[03:02:36.986 --> 03:02:37.506]  No, I agree.
[03:02:37.566 --> 03:02:38.727]  So let me ask you this question.
[03:02:39.582 --> 03:02:41.143]  Because I'm going to give this whole interview a headline.
[03:02:41.163 --> 03:02:41.703]  I'm going to put it out.
[03:02:41.723 --> 03:02:42.844]  I'm going to try to push it everywhere.
[03:02:42.864 --> 03:02:43.844]  I'm asking listeners to get it out.
[03:02:44.044 --> 03:02:45.265]  It's very powerful what you're saying.
[03:02:45.765 --> 03:02:46.945]  What do we call this interview?
[03:02:47.206 --> 03:02:55.570]  Because the first part's, I guess the first part's 9-11, but the last 20 minutes or so, you're breaking down the plan to take down America, China running world government.
[03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:56.170]  What do we call this?
[03:02:58.090 --> 03:02:58.590]  Oh, man.
[03:02:59.611 --> 03:03:00.552]  I don't know what we'd call it.
[03:03:00.952 --> 03:03:04.694]  We basically call it the conspiracy to tear down America.
[03:03:04.934 --> 03:03:06.615]  And it's been that way since 9-11.
[03:03:06.955 --> 03:03:08.976]  It's the controlled demolition of America.
[03:03:08.996 --> 03:03:10.157]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:03:10.517 --> 03:03:19.883]  When the controlled demolition happened in New York on September 11, 2001, we saw not only the controlled demolition of buildings, but we saw the controlled demolition of our country.
[03:03:19.903 --> 03:03:20.263]  That's right.
[03:03:20.283 --> 03:03:23.445]  They used the fear to take control, but it wasn't about
[03:03:24.085 --> 03:03:24.766]  Protecting us.
[03:03:24.886 --> 03:03:31.411]  And the American system, just as the King of England said 240 years ago, they said the American system can't exist or our imperial system will fail.
[03:03:31.732 --> 03:03:37.877]  That's why all the authoritarians are advertising at Davos the Chinese communist system, because America competes with that.
[03:03:39.628 --> 03:03:52.181]  Yeah, and that's the situation is that if we want to involve ourselves on the world stage, it will have to be sort of, I think, compromising with socialism.
[03:03:52.221 --> 03:03:58.767]  The socialism bias and the idea of socialism was put on the table after 9-11.
[03:03:59.708 --> 03:04:03.110]  And it was always brought up, but always sequestered, always put to sleep.
[03:04:03.450 --> 03:04:04.691]  But now it's powerful.
[03:04:04.991 --> 03:04:06.372]  The resistance is powerful.
[03:04:06.432 --> 03:04:08.473]  The media is the resistance.
[03:04:08.973 --> 03:04:10.554]  No, I agree.
[03:04:11.114 --> 03:04:12.775]  Gut level, do you think Trump survives?
[03:04:12.795 --> 03:04:12.835]  No.
[03:04:15.256 --> 03:04:19.378]  And that's sad, but no.
[03:04:21.780 --> 03:04:24.101]  I think in current moves, they're planning to take him out.
[03:04:24.161 --> 03:04:26.722]  I think it's up to us to get involved and change destiny, but I agree.
[03:04:27.102 --> 03:04:27.903]  Right now, I feel like
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:31.542]  Ever since Helsinki, they were planning it, I think.
[03:04:31.602 --> 03:04:50.960]  I think that when you have a guy from Greenpeace flying over the golf course, when you have one of his CIA agents that fell ill and died, when they were using weapons like they did on the Cuban diplomats, American diplomats, and Cuban diplomats in China, the microwaves, I have a feeling that, you know, little by little, they can break him down.
[03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:55.063]  I was about to say, they're using Chinese operatives against America, the Deep State is.
[03:04:55.404 --> 03:04:56.585]  Clyde Lewis, very impressive.
[03:04:57.045 --> 03:04:57.986]  GroundZeroMinute.org.
[03:04:58.046 --> 03:04:59.007]  Please come on next week.
[03:04:59.027 --> 03:05:01.569]  We'll be listening at 9, 10 o'clock Central with your big kickoff.
[03:05:01.589 --> 03:05:01.950]  God bless.
[03:05:04.972 --> 03:05:10.994]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[03:05:11.394 --> 03:05:12.274]  And I want to thank you all.
[03:05:12.354 --> 03:05:13.315]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[03:05:13.335 --> 03:05:15.115]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[03:05:15.175 --> 03:05:21.437]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[03:05:21.698 --> 03:05:23.818]  And we've got products that help you.
[03:05:23.838 --> 03:05:26.999]  I mean, even mainstream media admits, they have to, that fish oil is the best thing out there.
[03:05:27.039 --> 03:05:28.260]  But you want pure fish oil.
[03:05:28.340 --> 03:05:29.720]  You want the mercury removed.
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:32.181]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[03:05:32.261 --> 03:05:40.163]  The best krill oil, the best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic, salmon, and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids, the honor roll.
[03:05:40.183 --> 03:05:40.803]  Three different types.
[03:05:40.843 --> 03:05:41.784]  You cannot do better.
[03:05:41.824 --> 03:05:42.664]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:42.684 --> 03:05:44.965]  Help the brain, help the body, help the heart, help the InfoWars.
[03:05:45.005 --> 03:05:45.785]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[03:05:45.865 --> 03:05:48.186]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula, about to sell out bodies.
[03:05:48.266 --> 03:05:49.006]  That's 50% off.
[03:05:49.106 --> 03:05:51.006]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[03:05:51.126 --> 03:05:52.927]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:05:53.027 --> 03:05:58.709]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[03:05:59.029 --> 03:05:59.429]  I need it!
[03:06:12.409 --> 03:06:20.036]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:06:50.192 --> 03:06:55.307]  Well, I gotta tell ya, this has been a powerful 9-11 transmission.
[03:06:58.303 --> 03:07:05.371]  And under massive censorship, under massive demonization, we are standing firm and expanding our attack against the globalists.
[03:07:05.391 --> 03:07:11.517]  Thanks to you, the listeners and viewers, and all the amazing AM and FM affiliates, and the TV affiliates, and the cable affiliates.
[03:07:12.078 --> 03:07:17.143]  You know, the last six months, TV and cable picked us up.
[03:07:17.163 --> 03:07:19.706]  500 plus total stations and networks.
[03:07:21.220 --> 03:07:28.302]  But now, radio, I mean, I love every little station, every big station, but man, we're getting all the liners next week.
[03:07:28.742 --> 03:07:32.443]  20 plus stations that I'm going to cut liners for that I'm going to be announcing here.
[03:07:32.583 --> 03:07:42.165]  I mean, we're talking, just in California, San Francisco, and Sacramento, and I mean, it's amazing.
[03:07:42.992 --> 03:07:48.296]  So, and stations in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida, and New York, and Illinois, and Texas.
[03:07:48.396 --> 03:07:50.857]  I mean, we're talking number one stations.
[03:07:50.997 --> 03:07:53.399]  It's on like Donkey Kong.
[03:07:55.080 --> 03:07:56.381]  People really get it.
[03:07:57.202 --> 03:07:58.402]  And they really understand it.
[03:07:58.422 --> 03:08:02.425]  And if you're a local listener to local stations, I'm censored all over Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[03:08:03.106 --> 03:08:04.867]  But those stations' feeds aren't.
[03:08:05.819 --> 03:08:09.761]  So you can grab that feed and share that everywhere, and their AI isn't picking up on it.
[03:08:09.821 --> 03:08:13.043]  So, that's a critical chink in the enemy's armor.
[03:08:13.363 --> 03:08:25.529]  Now, that said, the Washington Post came out and said, the traffic to InfoWarsTore.com is up 50% since we banned him five weeks ago.
[03:08:26.730 --> 03:08:27.850]  Yeah, and I already told you that.
[03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:32.593]  They got major universities and Democratic Party CIA groups.
[03:08:32.733 --> 03:08:33.213]  It's admitted.
[03:08:33.673 --> 03:08:34.674]  Here's the Washington Post article.
[03:08:36.378 --> 03:08:38.499]  Watching everything and tracking everything.
[03:08:39.019 --> 03:08:40.919]  But I would just give you the numbers if you just ask.
[03:08:41.079 --> 03:08:45.940]  We're up financially 10% from last year in this last month.
[03:08:47.641 --> 03:08:50.982]  But we were down six months from last year.
[03:08:51.102 --> 03:08:54.482]  So I'm not in expansion mode.
[03:08:54.542 --> 03:08:55.563]  I'm under total attack.
[03:08:55.923 --> 03:08:56.643]  Everybody knows it.
[03:08:56.683 --> 03:08:57.543]  I'm trying to expand.
[03:08:58.063 --> 03:08:59.804]  Capital will fix a lot of our problems.
[03:09:00.504 --> 03:09:01.364]  Plus I make it easy.
[03:09:02.995 --> 03:09:10.219]  But you notice they have the major universities, the CIA, the Washington Post, all in an article saying they're scanning our site and we're up 50%.
[03:09:10.980 --> 03:09:12.781]  What did I tell you a couple weeks ago?
[03:09:16.844 --> 03:09:22.527]  Traffic to the website tripled the first couple days, went down to double, and now it's 6, 7, 8% higher.
[03:09:23.007 --> 03:09:27.110]  And overall, the last five weeks, the shopping carts got 50% increase in traffic.
[03:09:27.870 --> 03:09:29.371]  But oh, the Washington Post says it.
[03:09:29.732 --> 03:09:31.853]  But now that's one of the only few things they say true in there.
[03:09:33.527 --> 03:09:35.788]  They're like Jones in the New York Times.
[03:09:35.868 --> 03:09:40.191]  Jones bought four Rolexes in one day his divorce paper show.
[03:09:40.491 --> 03:09:43.152]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:09:44.673 --> 03:09:47.395]  I had an employee give me my first Rolex when I was getting divorced.
[03:09:48.015 --> 03:09:48.856]  It's an American watch.
[03:09:48.916 --> 03:09:50.957]  I'm wearing a tag that one of my crew gave me.
[03:09:52.884 --> 03:09:55.867]  I'm all about free market, but I don't sell out for money.
[03:09:56.107 --> 03:10:08.639]  And so, I had a girlfriend who I married, and I went to the Rolex store to buy Tim Pruge, who'd been working 20 hours a day, and had not had a pay raise in three years, and I said, I'm gonna buy him a Rolex.
[03:10:10.316 --> 03:10:12.698]  And I ended up buying my wife one, soon to be wife.
[03:10:13.218 --> 03:10:15.800]  And then I bought my cousin one, and I bought Rob Do one.
[03:10:16.300 --> 03:10:17.401]  But that's how they spend it.
[03:10:17.421 --> 03:10:19.322]  Yeah, I bought them all $7,000 Rolexes.
[03:10:19.362 --> 03:10:19.962]  Damn right I did.
[03:10:20.203 --> 03:10:24.566]  Because I noticed bonuses aren't the same as a watch, where somebody knows how much you care about them.
[03:10:25.406 --> 03:10:27.908]  But that's the type of... We're not against people having wealth.
[03:10:28.248 --> 03:10:29.829]  We're not against people having success.
[03:10:31.951 --> 03:10:32.731]  And I'm wearing a $3,000 watch right now.
[03:10:34.960 --> 03:10:40.966]  Why, frankly, I had somebody give me, a listener, a $35,000 Rolex three years ago.
[03:10:42.007 --> 03:10:43.609]  You know what I did with that $35,000 Rolex?
[03:10:45.230 --> 03:10:46.151]  I took it and I sold it.
[03:10:47.152 --> 03:10:48.473]  And I put it into this operation.
[03:10:50.095 --> 03:10:51.897]  But that's how they play these games.
[03:10:52.617 --> 03:10:53.358]  You know why I love this?
[03:10:53.378 --> 03:10:55.520]  Because Tim gave me this watch.
[03:10:55.801 --> 03:10:55.520]  $3,000.
[03:10:56.221 --> 03:10:57.923]  He bought it on a trip with his wife to Vegas.
[03:10:59.957 --> 03:11:01.318]  Because I told him, I really like your watch.
[03:11:01.718 --> 03:11:02.199]  And he bought me.
[03:11:02.219 --> 03:11:03.180]  This is the watch I wear now.
[03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:04.501]  Because this is my favorite.
[03:11:04.601 --> 03:11:05.622]  I'm not doing an advert tag.
[03:11:06.042 --> 03:11:08.564]  This sucker's lightweight, awesome, keeps great time.
[03:11:08.584 --> 03:11:10.265]  This is the watch I wear now.
[03:11:10.906 --> 03:11:12.507]  Not the Rolex I sold.
[03:11:13.688 --> 03:11:16.350]  But imagine, Bezos owns the Washington Post.
[03:11:16.410 --> 03:11:19.713]  He's worth $170 billion last time I checked.
[03:11:20.573 --> 03:11:21.634]  He doesn't pay taxes.
[03:11:21.674 --> 03:11:23.156]  I pay 40% federal taxes.
[03:11:23.536 --> 03:11:24.777]  I'm not a rich, powerful globalist.
[03:11:25.976 --> 03:11:32.177]  I'm trying to expand against these people, and they're demonizing and attacking me, like I'm a bad guy because I sell supplements.
[03:11:32.217 --> 03:11:33.677]  Okay, it's $159 billion right now.
[03:11:34.258 --> 03:11:35.138]  These people are sick.
[03:11:37.078 --> 03:11:40.079]  So again, when you fund us, we're able to expand in their face.
[03:11:40.219 --> 03:11:43.519]  If I have to sell my house to fund this operation, that could come in the future, I'll do it.
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.100]  Only fund us a few months though.
[03:11:46.720 --> 03:11:52.601]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, and we've got X2, we've had it for five plus years,
[03:11:54.309 --> 03:11:56.610]  That is the only deutsch birth crystal source of iodine.
[03:11:57.310 --> 03:11:58.110]  It's so amazing.
[03:11:59.631 --> 03:12:03.212]  And the oil companies that drill it out of the crystals at 12,000 feet are trying to put it over a barrel.
[03:12:03.452 --> 03:12:04.152]  So I broke the contract.
[03:12:04.172 --> 03:12:04.492]  It's gone.
[03:12:04.832 --> 03:12:05.592]  We may get another one.
[03:12:05.632 --> 03:12:08.513]  It may come back, but that'll take six months to a year to get rolling.
[03:12:09.193 --> 03:12:10.414]  So X2, this is the final X2.
[03:12:10.434 --> 03:12:11.754]  It'll probably have a new name when it comes out.
[03:12:15.444 --> 03:12:17.608]  I've discounted 25% even though there's a run on it.
[03:12:18.269 --> 03:12:20.873]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:12:20.893 --> 03:12:22.135]  Alright, Paul Watson takes over.
[03:12:22.155 --> 03:12:23.257]  He's got a big guest.
[03:12:25.612 --> 03:12:31.098]  A lot of folks are getting banned off Amazon, but this is one of the first big guys they did to officially nine books in one day.
[03:12:31.478 --> 03:12:33.460]  But Paul, what would you call this epic time?
[03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:42.189]  Rebellion in the White House, deep state coups, crazy town going on, massive censorship, the left throwing a temper tantrum, nationalists winning everywhere.
[03:12:42.489 --> 03:12:45.872]  This is the unstoppable force runs into the immovable object.
[03:12:46.213 --> 03:12:47.514]  Paul Joseph Watson, take over.
[03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.731]  Thanks Alex.
[03:12:49.751 --> 03:12:51.552]  Yeah, I would call it the age of hysteria.
[03:12:51.592 --> 03:13:04.803]  I mean, I just tweeted something earlier from an LGBTQ plus account, if they've got enough of the letters there, it's probably a hate crime if they forgot and left out one of them, linked to a major university in London, literally tweeting
[03:13:05.706 --> 03:13:17.969]  That people should be put in a gulag and that thought criminals who are put in a gulag for being bigots, that is compassionate, that is a non-violent course of action to put people with whom you disagree in a gulag.
[03:13:18.349 --> 03:13:25.631]  Literally we're at that level now where they've just embraced total totalitarianism and it truly is the age of hysteria.
[03:13:26.171 --> 03:13:28.992]  As he said at the bottom of the hour we've got Roosh V coming up
[03:13:30.063 --> 03:13:37.707]  And to get out in advance of all the idiots who are going to say the most predictable things ever, yes, we know that Roosh V is a controversial person.
[03:13:37.968 --> 03:13:40.789]  We know that he's said offensive things in the past.
[03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:44.531]  We know that people like Sarah Jong have said very offensive things in the past.
[03:13:44.871 --> 03:13:50.895]  James Gunn, Peter Fonda, literally tweeting about locking up Barron Trump in a cage with paedophiles.
[03:13:51.355 --> 03:13:53.757]  Does he get his commerce withdrawn?
[03:13:53.797 --> 03:13:56.420]  Does he get his right to live and make money withdrawn?
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:01.504]  No, he doesn't, and I don't think he should either, because everybody's offended by something.
[03:14:01.804 --> 03:14:04.487]  So you either support free speech, or you don't.
[03:14:04.747 --> 03:14:11.252]  If you don't support offensive free speech, you don't support free speech, because everything's offensive to someone.
[03:14:11.853 --> 03:14:14.275]  So I'm absolutely sick of this non-argument.
[03:14:15.056 --> 03:14:18.719]  Well, what about Newsday calling for me to be murdered by being stabbed in the throat?
[03:14:19.511 --> 03:14:21.272]  Oh, that's trendy, that's tolerant, that's fine.
[03:14:21.612 --> 03:14:24.653]  I'm just sick of people completely losing grasp of this.
[03:14:25.013 --> 03:14:29.314]  What was it, like 60% of college students now barely even know what the First Amendment is.
[03:14:29.715 --> 03:14:32.415]  Offensive speech is part of free speech.
[03:14:32.716 --> 03:14:34.236]  The Supreme Court said it.
[03:14:34.936 --> 03:14:37.837]  I mean, this is so simple and people have just deliberately forgot about it.
[03:14:37.857 --> 03:14:38.678]  Paul, I'm going to let you take over.
[03:14:38.698 --> 03:14:40.798]  You're on fire here, but they're making their move.
[03:14:40.818 --> 03:14:41.639]  That's my question to you.
[03:14:41.659 --> 03:14:42.279]  Then you take over.
[03:14:42.619 --> 03:14:43.319]  They don't care.
[03:14:43.379 --> 03:14:44.660]  They're making an authoritarian move.
[03:14:44.700 --> 03:14:45.600]  Now they're banning books.
[03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:47.461]  What do you think they're planning next?
[03:14:47.601 --> 03:14:48.221]  I think violence.
[03:14:50.290 --> 03:14:50.891]  Well, probably.
[03:14:50.951 --> 03:14:53.212]  I mean, we've talked about the threats to Trump.
[03:14:53.252 --> 03:14:56.615]  There's been tweets threatening the assassination of Trump on Twitter.
[03:14:56.855 --> 03:14:59.197]  These people don't only still have accounts, they're verified.
[03:14:59.577 --> 03:15:13.088]  This goes back to a Media Matters plan, most people don't know this, from January 2017, where they said they would become partners with social media organisations because Conservatives had weaponised them during the election campaign.
[03:15:13.148 --> 03:15:17.752]  In other words, Conservatives have finally learned how to use them and had success.
[03:15:18.232 --> 03:15:19.312]  So it goes back to that.
[03:15:19.673 --> 03:15:33.657]  They said they secured access to raw data from Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites and that they were going to partner with these social media sites to eliminate the most destructive forces and quote fake news.
[03:15:34.117 --> 03:15:36.518]  That's the raft on which they introduced this tyranny.
[03:15:36.918 --> 03:15:39.098]  People need to go back to that document and look at it.
[03:15:39.138 --> 03:15:41.239]  They had a four-year plan to get rid of Trump.
[03:15:41.679 --> 03:15:47.621]  The first step, the major step, was getting his most prominent supporters banned on social media.
[03:15:48.021 --> 03:15:50.345]  Now it's happening basically every day.
[03:15:50.365 --> 03:15:54.152]  We're going to get more into it on the next side of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:54.473 --> 03:15:58.640]  Also big news regarding hate crime in the UK, how they're enforcing that.
[03:15:58.700 --> 03:15:59.361]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:59.441 --> 03:16:00.523]  InfoWars.com.
[03:16:04.616 --> 03:16:20.064]  But this is part of a larger push from conservatives, where they allege that these social media companies have bias against conservatives, and it's very similar, I think, what you see them doing with the media, where they say that these powerful entities are pushing a supposed liberal bias on consumers.
[03:16:20.825 --> 03:16:32.491]  There isn't really anything there in most of the instances that they point to, but it's part of a larger agenda, and it's really a political issue that they're using to whip up the conservative base, excite the conservative base for the midterms.
[03:16:32.911 --> 03:16:40.954]  Look at this right here, the guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[03:16:41.435 --> 03:16:43.475]  You are incredibly shameful.
[03:16:43.515 --> 03:16:45.396]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:16:45.416 --> 03:16:49.678]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[03:16:49.698 --> 03:16:53.379]  You're going to go down the history books at the Criminal News Network.
[03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:55.860]  This is one of the main people right here.
[03:16:57.681 --> 03:16:58.742]  Who thinks you have no memory?
[03:16:58.802 --> 03:17:00.063]  I mean, look at those eyes, folks.
[03:17:00.083 --> 03:17:03.186]  You want to see the eyes of a rat.
[03:17:04.166 --> 03:17:05.267]  No, I'm serious.
[03:17:05.287 --> 03:17:06.368]  Just look at the camera.
[03:17:06.548 --> 03:17:07.429]  Look at those eyes.
[03:17:07.849 --> 03:17:14.315]  Look at that slobbering to the system and the criminals at CNN, all their warmongering and death and all their fake news, and then running around
[03:17:15.235 --> 03:17:17.177]  I'm trying to police the internet.
[03:17:17.257 --> 03:17:18.437]  I'm trying to shut people down.
[03:17:18.457 --> 03:17:19.978]  And then you think people are so stupid.
[03:17:20.299 --> 03:17:22.800]  I'm seeing it in a week later, you say no one's censoring anybody.
[03:17:23.061 --> 03:17:24.181]  No one's pushing for censoring.
[03:17:24.341 --> 03:17:28.604]  And then you say that Trump is the one attacking the press, but only does it stand up to your lies.
[03:17:29.125 --> 03:17:30.546]  Just look at this guy's eyes.
[03:17:30.606 --> 03:17:31.926]  He's even more evil looking.
[03:17:31.946 --> 03:17:34.488]  Something to think about the decisions that you made.
[03:17:34.508 --> 03:17:36.389]  You don't even respond because we're just scum.
[03:17:36.650 --> 03:17:38.931]  You sit there at CNN with no viewers, no followers.
[03:17:39.011 --> 03:17:40.292]  Everyone can't stand you.
[03:17:40.332 --> 03:17:41.813]  And no matter, you can shut everyone down on earth.
[03:17:42.193 --> 03:17:42.834]  No one will like you.
[03:17:43.700 --> 03:17:44.180]  You understand that?
[03:17:44.541 --> 03:17:46.442]  You'll never have millions and millions of fans and followers.
[03:17:46.482 --> 03:17:48.224]  You'll never have people that love you.
[03:17:48.244 --> 03:17:50.466]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say, Alex?
[03:17:50.486 --> 03:17:50.626]  No.
[03:17:50.666 --> 03:17:56.050]  You are a dishonorable liar who would never even dare have me on your little tiny shows when you and Stelter called me a virus.
[03:17:56.290 --> 03:17:59.013]  You are a virus to America and freedom.
[03:17:59.073 --> 03:18:00.734]  You are authoritarianism.
[03:18:01.775 --> 03:18:03.757]  Just look in those eyes.
[03:18:03.797 --> 03:18:05.638]  The hunger to silence America.
[03:18:05.698 --> 03:18:07.260]  The hunger to extinguish the First Amendment.
[03:18:07.620 --> 03:18:08.861]  The hunger to deceive.
[03:18:08.901 --> 03:18:10.022]  But he can't do it.
[03:18:10.402 --> 03:18:12.605]  Because the fire of liberty is not going to be knocked out.
[03:18:12.705 --> 03:18:14.186]  You're the definition of a fraud.
[03:18:14.226 --> 03:18:18.051]  You are a charlatan that goes around lying about people that destroy the First Amendment.
[03:18:18.131 --> 03:18:19.192]  I haven't lied about anyone, Alex.
[03:18:19.212 --> 03:18:20.834]  Yes, you are a congenital liar.
[03:18:21.594 --> 03:18:24.137]  CNN is a giant fraud that hated the world over.
[03:18:25.439 --> 03:18:26.380]  None of what you're saying is true?
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:27.080]  That's not true.
[03:18:27.100 --> 03:18:27.520]  That's not true.
[03:18:27.540 --> 03:18:27.980]  That's not true.
[03:18:47.995 --> 03:18:49.316]  Listen, everybody knows who you are.
[03:18:50.316 --> 03:18:52.637]  Look, you and Stelter get force-fed by Twitter.
[03:18:52.657 --> 03:18:53.837]  You get like a hundred retweets.
[03:18:54.177 --> 03:18:55.858]  Because CNN's a joke.
[03:18:55.878 --> 03:18:57.118]  CNN's like government cheese.
[03:18:58.039 --> 03:18:59.919]  It literally is just force-fed to everyone everywhere.
[03:18:59.939 --> 03:19:00.720]  Everyone's sick of it.
[03:19:00.740 --> 03:19:03.461]  It's one of the main progenitors in this whole operation.
[03:19:03.501 --> 03:19:06.862]  You don't think we don't know about Obama's countering disinformation propaganda?
[03:19:08.242 --> 03:19:10.223]  You don't think all that's going to come out who's funding this?
[03:19:11.764 --> 03:19:13.444]  And your little ID card and all the rest of it?
[03:19:13.484 --> 03:19:14.204]  You think we're stupid?
[03:19:14.865 --> 03:19:15.405]  You think, uh,
[03:19:16.468 --> 03:19:17.349]  You think we're playing games, huh?
[03:19:17.369 --> 03:19:20.791]  You think we don't know a thing or two, son?
[03:19:21.251 --> 03:19:22.652]  Yeah.
[03:19:22.712 --> 03:19:24.574]  That's illegal, what Obama set up.
[03:19:25.154 --> 03:19:26.275]  It's all going to come down.
[03:19:26.315 --> 03:19:38.323]  You think because you've got some Democrats and some committees and some stay-behind networks, like the 37 angry Democrats in the Justice Department trying to shut down Trump, you think because you've got a rogue group operating inside those agencies that you're going to be able to shut down the free press in America?
[03:19:38.504 --> 03:19:39.304]  We are here.
[03:19:39.344 --> 03:19:40.225]  Paul Revere is here.
[03:19:40.425 --> 03:19:42.747]  The American people are watching, and they're not going to let you win.
[03:19:43.707 --> 03:19:45.168]  You called for us to be the platform.
[03:19:45.348 --> 03:19:45.949]  You pushed it.
[03:19:46.169 --> 03:19:47.270]  Now you say it's not even happening.
[03:19:47.310 --> 03:19:47.730]  It is true.
[03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:49.231]  CNN lobbied for it.
[03:19:49.271 --> 03:19:52.293]  That's all CNN did was call for me to be taken off here.
[03:19:52.333 --> 03:19:53.234]  That's all you've done.
[03:19:53.254 --> 03:19:54.675]  That's what you said needs to be taken down.
[03:19:54.935 --> 03:19:55.796]  Why aren't you taking it down?
[03:19:55.816 --> 03:19:59.919]  If I could rig the playing field and shut everybody else down, I might be a real voice someday.
[03:20:06.083 --> 03:20:08.745]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.045 --> 03:20:22.650]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.050 --> 03:20:26.753]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:29.164 --> 03:20:42.615]  We're back on the fourth hour of the most banned censored broadcast in the known universe and at the bottom of the hour we're going to go to Roosh V to talk about how he's been basically de-platformed by the book-burning Nazis at Amazon.com.
[03:20:43.215 --> 03:20:44.636]  First of all we're going to talk about this.
[03:20:44.676 --> 03:20:47.318]  This was an article that was up on Infowars.com yesterday.
[03:20:47.899 --> 03:20:50.041]  We've got a video to go along with this here in a second.
[03:20:50.181 --> 03:20:55.085]  UK police tell citizens to report offensive comments even if they're not hate crimes.
[03:20:55.125 --> 03:20:56.626]  They literally put out a tweet.
[03:20:57.552 --> 03:20:58.272]  Telling people.
[03:20:58.592 --> 03:20:59.853]  This is South Yorkshire Police.
[03:20:59.873 --> 03:21:01.553]  This is where I used to live in Sheffield.
[03:21:01.593 --> 03:21:02.393]  It covers that area.
[03:21:03.014 --> 03:21:13.316]  They said, in addition to reporting hate crime, please report non-crime hate incidents, which can include things like offensive or insulting comments online, in person or in writing.
[03:21:13.596 --> 03:21:15.597]  Hate will not be tolerated in South Yorkshire.
[03:21:15.637 --> 03:21:17.097]  Report it and put a stop to it.
[03:21:17.117 --> 03:21:18.618]  Have you ever seen 1984?
[03:21:18.758 --> 03:21:20.158]  I re-watched 1984 with John Hurt the other day.
[03:21:23.078 --> 03:21:28.765]  Literally the kids tattletailing on their parents because they said something that might have been offensive to the state.
[03:21:29.145 --> 03:21:37.856]  Now the police in this area of the UK are telling people to phone them up if they're offended by something, even if it's not a hate crime.
[03:21:38.156 --> 03:21:42.101]  Obviously our hate crime definitions in the UK are way stronger than in America.
[03:21:42.921 --> 03:21:46.304]  But they said, even if it's obviously not a crime, tell us anyway.
[03:21:46.324 --> 03:21:51.069]  Because then after we've investigated it, it might escalate to the level of a crime.
[03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:57.335]  Meanwhile, in the same area of the country, violent crime in South Yorkshire up nearly 60%.
[03:21:59.377 --> 03:22:00.979]  Well, what a surprise that is.
[03:22:01.359 --> 03:22:03.982]  They're wasting precious police resources.
[03:22:04.282 --> 03:22:07.385]  The Left constantly claims about how the police don't get enough resources.
[03:22:08.237 --> 03:22:17.539]  And they have a 60% increase in crime, in actual violent crime in this region, meanwhile they're telling people to report offensive comments on the internet.
[03:22:17.799 --> 03:22:19.419]  Do you see the disconnect there?
[03:22:19.819 --> 03:22:33.322]  This is the same police organisation that is under 98 separate investigations into their response, lack thereof, or basically a cover-up in some cases, to the grooming gang scandal in Rotherham.
[03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:34.568]  You remember that?
[03:22:34.808 --> 03:22:38.249]  Thousands of girls trafficked by Muslim grooming gangs.
[03:22:38.529 --> 03:22:40.130]  The police turned a blind eye to it.
[03:22:40.350 --> 03:22:44.131]  The council helped cover it up because they didn't want to be called racist.
[03:22:44.311 --> 03:22:50.392]  So there are 98 separate investigations into potential misconduct by police officers in this area.
[03:22:51.073 --> 03:22:54.233]  And they're telling people to report offensive tweets.
[03:22:54.934 --> 03:22:56.094]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:22:56.980 --> 03:23:03.922]  We have a situation in the United Kingdom where only 9% of crimes end with suspects being charged or summoned.
[03:23:04.462 --> 03:23:04.662]  Only 9%!
[03:23:06.262 --> 03:23:17.484]  We've got police forces in some areas of the country telling citizens that they will stop investigating quote low-level crimes like shoplifting, car crime and criminal damage due to budget cuts.
[03:23:17.945 --> 03:23:19.985]  Oh, but there's plenty of room in the budget
[03:23:20.569 --> 03:23:26.754]  To go and knock on somebody's door if they said something mean on the internet, which isn't even a crime.
[03:23:27.415 --> 03:23:29.897]  Absolutely ludicrous situation.
[03:23:30.618 --> 03:23:38.704]  And today, they had one of the police commissioners from that body on a radio show, and it got only more ludicrous and absurd.
[03:23:38.744 --> 03:23:39.845]  Let's go to this clip now.
[03:23:39.905 --> 03:23:40.286]  Here it is.
[03:23:41.725 --> 03:23:48.167]  ...has risen 30% compared with a national rise of 21%, including a very, very serious violent crime.
[03:23:48.887 --> 03:23:52.708]  I'm sure some people's feelings are hurt, but is that a top priority for the police?
[03:23:52.728 --> 03:23:58.290]  I was at a meeting yesterday in the Winter Gardens in Sheffield city centre, where we were looking at
[03:23:58.970 --> 03:24:02.413]  Knife crime, and we gathered together people from different communities.
[03:24:02.493 --> 03:24:22.909]  Now, some of those were people from different ethnic minority communities, but precisely the sort of people who were deeply affected by the incident that happened on Saturday and the... I think the people who were most affected by the incident on Saturday were the people who were terrified out of their wits when some six-foot woman ran through the town shouting, kill, kill, kill, with a large knife in her hand.
[03:24:23.010 --> 03:24:25.712]  No, you're absolutely wrong, partly because I suppose... I'm wrong.
[03:24:26.352 --> 03:24:29.193]  Well, you're wrong in the sense that it wasn't only those people.
[03:24:29.293 --> 03:24:30.234]  Those people were affected.
[03:24:30.294 --> 03:24:46.702]  No, I said the people who were most... You're telling me that someone who saw a nasty tweet the day after an incident in which someone ran down the street shouting, kill, kill, kill, in the middle of the city, and you're saying that, well, no, their feelings may well have been hurt just as much.
[03:24:47.498 --> 03:24:52.181]  No, I'm saying to you that on Saturday when that incident happened, there were a lot of people affected.
[03:24:52.641 --> 03:24:57.924]  Market traders, people who were shopping in the town centre, people who were passing by, they were deeply affected by that.
[03:24:58.624 --> 03:25:11.851]  Also, because of the vile racist comments that were put on social media and elsewhere and the rumours that ran around, other people were affected as well, well beyond the town centre, and that included some people from ethnic minority groups.
[03:25:16.248 --> 03:25:17.829]  You've got to laugh, otherwise you'd cry.
[03:25:18.149 --> 03:25:32.441]  What they're referring to is an incident in a town called Barnsley, which is in South Yorkshire, the same area covered by this police force, where a six-foot Muslim woman in a hijab was running through the town centre with a large knife, shouting, kill, kill, kill.
[03:25:33.182 --> 03:25:35.484]  Non-terror-related, they later told us, of course.
[03:25:35.544 --> 03:25:36.224]  Of course it would be.
[03:25:37.105 --> 03:25:41.689]  So they literally had a Muslim woman in a hijab running through the town centre, threatening to kill people.
[03:25:42.648 --> 03:25:44.389]  With a foot-long machete.
[03:25:44.409 --> 03:25:46.450]  It wasn't even a knife, it was a foot-long machete.
[03:25:47.451 --> 03:25:48.672]  Traumatising people.
[03:25:48.712 --> 03:25:51.053]  Luckily I don't think anyone was seriously injured.
[03:25:51.974 --> 03:26:00.139]  And the police responded by saying of equal importance to that attempted attack, attempted butchery of people in this South Yorkshire town.
[03:26:00.942 --> 03:26:06.406]  was mean tweets and comments on the internet in the 24 hours after about Muslims.
[03:26:06.987 --> 03:26:23.040]  And that's what he literally just said was that those people are equally as traumatized as the people who are faced with this six-foot woman screaming insane, running towards them with a machete on a Saturday afternoon when they're trying to do their shopping.
[03:26:24.031 --> 03:26:26.678]  This is the state of political correctness in the UK.
[03:26:26.979 --> 03:26:30.848]  This is the same police force that covered up, that turned a blind eye.
[03:26:31.656 --> 03:26:37.118]  To actual grooming of children in this area for years and years and years.
[03:26:37.158 --> 03:26:44.960]  This is the same police force that has overseen a situation where violent crime in the area is up nearly 60% in one year.
[03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:47.681]  With violent offences soaring by almost 60%.
[03:26:48.261 --> 03:26:51.882]  Stalking and harassment reports increased by 158% in this region.
[03:26:51.902 --> 03:26:52.742]  Sexual offences were up by 24%.
[03:26:52.782 --> 03:26:53.302]  Robbery increased by 30%.
[03:26:59.944 --> 03:27:06.510]  Now, we've got a violent crime problem in the UK, but these figures are literally double or more the rest of the country.
[03:27:06.931 --> 03:27:10.274]  So in this area of the country, it's twice as bad.
[03:27:10.914 --> 03:27:14.157]  The harassment, the violent crimes, the sexual assaults, the attacks.
[03:27:14.878 --> 03:27:22.545]  And they've got a police commissioner telling everyone on the radio that the people traumatized by that, the people impacted by that,
[03:27:23.391 --> 03:27:33.597]  are only equally as important as the ethnic minorities traumatised and impacted by mean comments on the internet which they probably didn't even read.
[03:27:33.818 --> 03:27:38.240]  Like, these comments are probably being reported by idiot white leftists on the internet.
[03:27:38.260 --> 03:27:42.843]  They're probably not even being read by an ethnic minority that would be offended by them.
[03:27:43.564 --> 03:27:50.468]  We have a situation in the UK where 3,000 people are arrested every single year
[03:27:51.078 --> 03:27:53.739]  For basically mean tweets, mean comments on Facebook.
[03:27:54.639 --> 03:28:10.885]  This is 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which makes it illegal to intentionally quote cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, which of course is completely broad, could be completely misinterpreted and completely abused, which it is.
[03:28:11.566 --> 03:28:15.067]  So the police are literally telling people to report
[03:28:15.976 --> 03:28:17.918]  Things that aren't crimes to them.
[03:28:18.239 --> 03:28:21.983]  Things which amount to nothing more than mean words on the internet.
[03:28:22.043 --> 03:28:22.524]  Boo-hoo.
[03:28:22.924 --> 03:28:27.029]  Meanwhile, terrorists... Oh, but it wasn't terrorists, so they tell us, and you can trust them.
[03:28:27.049 --> 03:28:30.554]  They're only under 98 different investigations into police misconduct.
[03:28:30.794 --> 03:28:32.055]  They've got a great record.
[03:28:32.696 --> 03:28:33.377]  You can trust them.
[03:28:33.837 --> 03:28:34.118]  You've got...
[03:28:34.893 --> 03:28:42.158]  Machete women literally running through the street with headscarves, shouting, kill, kill, kill, attempting to stab people.
[03:28:42.638 --> 03:28:52.424]  And South Yorkshire police are more concerned, it seems from what he said, about mean comments online and prosecuting things which they admit are not even crimes.
[03:28:52.924 --> 03:28:56.346]  Absolutely Kafka-esque Orwellian situation.
[03:28:56.847 --> 03:28:58.488]  It only seems to be getting worse.
[03:28:58.528 --> 03:28:59.228]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:59.268 --> 03:29:01.310]  This is the Import Wars Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:29:02.430 --> 03:29:06.112]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[03:29:06.392 --> 03:29:09.833]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[03:29:10.173 --> 03:29:19.717]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double-blind, FDA-cleared, human ingestion toxicity test.
[03:29:20.217 --> 03:29:20.597]  ...study.
[03:29:20.897 --> 03:29:23.638]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[03:29:23.998 --> 03:29:28.960]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:29:29.020 --> 03:29:31.380]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:36.182]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:29:36.262 --> 03:29:36.902]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:29:37.302 --> 03:29:41.104]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[03:29:41.324 --> 03:29:44.006]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[03:29:44.266 --> 03:29:47.568]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[03:29:47.948 --> 03:29:53.251]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[03:29:53.311 --> 03:29:57.474]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[03:29:58.334 --> 03:30:00.996]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:14.872]  You know, there's two different types of monarch butterflies.
[03:30:16.093 --> 03:30:30.886]  There's one type that takes several generations, you know, to get all the way up to Canada, and then they've got a big one that's three times bigger than the other little monarchs that flies all the way back down to Mexico, to one little mountain region, and then they fly all the way back up.
[03:30:31.066 --> 03:30:37.672]  They fly down, have their babies die, and then it takes generations, three generations, for the little ones to get up, and then the big one pops out, and it takes them back.
[03:30:37.732 --> 03:30:38.833]  And that's what America is.
[03:30:38.913 --> 03:30:39.874]  We're the big monarchs.
[03:30:40.014 --> 03:30:41.695]  That's going to carry humanity to the stars.
[03:30:41.715 --> 03:30:43.655]  That God's going to use to defeat the devil.
[03:30:43.875 --> 03:30:44.135]  Watch.
[03:30:44.596 --> 03:30:45.936]  I'm sure of it all now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:30:46.176 --> 03:30:48.217]  And we're now in that generation of the big monarchs.
[03:30:48.777 --> 03:30:52.018]  We've got to fly all the way from Canada, all the way down to central Mexico.
[03:30:52.158 --> 03:30:53.659]  This big, beautiful forest region.
[03:30:53.719 --> 03:30:55.519]  These big, giant, 500-foot-tall trees.
[03:30:55.700 --> 03:30:58.080]  And a lot of them drop out of the sky and die on their way.
[03:30:58.160 --> 03:30:58.861]  They fall out of the sky.
[03:30:58.881 --> 03:31:01.602]  I've been in Texas, and all of a sudden, big old monarchs start dropping out of the sky.
[03:31:01.702 --> 03:31:03.882]  I saw the documentary, and I was like, I saw that one time when I was a kid.
[03:31:03.942 --> 03:31:04.503]  They didn't make it.
[03:31:04.623 --> 03:31:05.703]  But some of them do make it.
[03:31:05.783 --> 03:31:08.304]  And they make it, and they mate, and they have babies, and they die.
[03:31:08.404 --> 03:31:15.310]  And then it takes those little babies, three generations, in less than a year, living their life cycle, to jump to the north.
[03:31:15.450 --> 03:31:18.152]  And then the big guy pops, and the big guy's got to come back down.
[03:31:18.232 --> 03:31:19.233]  And that's what this is right now.
[03:31:19.253 --> 03:31:20.214]  We're in that period.
[03:31:20.434 --> 03:31:21.355]  You're the big monarch.
[03:31:21.395 --> 03:31:22.256]  You're the big butterfly.
[03:31:22.796 --> 03:31:24.017]  You've got to take it all the way down.
[03:31:24.337 --> 03:31:26.439]  You've got to deliver it, or the species dies.
[03:31:26.860 --> 03:31:28.461]  You can't drop the ball at this level.
[03:31:28.561 --> 03:31:30.183]  We're at that in-game time.
[03:31:30.303 --> 03:31:32.246]  And the enemy knows we're turning the tide right now.
[03:31:32.306 --> 03:31:33.247]  They know we're turning the tide.
[03:31:33.287 --> 03:31:34.549]  They can feel our spirit rising.
[03:31:34.589 --> 03:31:35.250]  It's scaring them.
[03:31:35.370 --> 03:31:37.593]  Because it's what they want, but what they don't have.
[03:31:37.833 --> 03:31:39.135]  We already have all the innate power.
[03:31:39.195 --> 03:31:40.316]  We already have all of it.
[03:31:40.396 --> 03:31:41.097]  Keys of the universe.
[03:31:41.137 --> 03:31:42.039]  God already gave them to us.
[03:31:42.179 --> 03:31:43.260]  But we gotta learn how to drive first.
[03:31:43.380 --> 03:31:44.201]  This is Driver's Ed.
[03:31:44.442 --> 03:31:45.383]  God's just waiting right there.
[03:31:45.583 --> 03:31:46.464]  Pass the driving test.
[03:31:46.484 --> 03:31:48.145]  There's a big blue highway right there, baby.
[03:31:48.245 --> 03:31:48.645]  Come on up.
[03:31:48.725 --> 03:31:49.645]  Just like Stranglehold.
[03:31:49.766 --> 03:31:51.146]  Come on, come on up.
[03:31:51.246 --> 03:31:53.188]  Come on, come on, come on up.
[03:31:53.248 --> 03:31:55.189]  Come on, come on, come on!
[03:31:55.609 --> 03:31:56.670]  They want to keep you down.
[03:31:56.690 --> 03:31:57.970]  Oh, America's bad.
[03:31:58.010 --> 03:31:58.871]  America will never come back.
[03:31:58.891 --> 03:31:59.651]  America sucks.
[03:31:59.691 --> 03:32:00.312]  America's weak.
[03:32:00.352 --> 03:32:00.812]  You suck.
[03:32:00.852 --> 03:32:01.492]  You're nobody.
[03:32:01.853 --> 03:32:02.693]  No, no, no.
[03:32:02.753 --> 03:32:03.574]  You're a victim group.
[03:32:03.594 --> 03:32:04.554]  You're under our control.
[03:32:04.854 --> 03:32:06.295]  You just stay right there where you are.
[03:32:06.315 --> 03:32:08.056]  Oh, Alex Jones is a failure.
[03:32:08.176 --> 03:32:09.037]  Oh, you're a failure.
[03:32:09.177 --> 03:32:10.318]  Oh, Trump's a failure.
[03:32:10.378 --> 03:32:10.958]  No, you just
[03:32:11.098 --> 03:32:11.698]  Let's go down there.
[03:32:12.259 --> 03:32:13.200]  That'll give you a little fluoride.
[03:32:13.260 --> 03:32:14.480]  How about some mercury?
[03:32:14.500 --> 03:32:16.982]  How about we brain damage you so we can lure it over you?
[03:32:17.202 --> 03:32:23.307]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[03:32:23.387 --> 03:32:25.448]  Nobody's got stuff at this level, just like our info.
[03:32:25.488 --> 03:32:31.812]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and Satanist and anti-human filth.
[03:32:31.892 --> 03:32:34.394]  There's no organization more focused, more crazed.
[03:32:34.714 --> 03:32:35.135]  This is it.
[03:32:35.595 --> 03:32:37.537]  We've got products that help you.
[03:32:37.637 --> 03:32:38.157]  Help the brain.
[03:32:38.197 --> 03:32:38.637]  Help the body.
[03:32:38.677 --> 03:32:39.118]  Help the heart.
[03:32:39.158 --> 03:32:39.898]  Help the Infowar.
[03:32:39.938 --> 03:32:40.739]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[03:32:40.859 --> 03:32:41.740]  Non-zero-sum game.
[03:32:41.840 --> 03:32:42.881]  Planetary expansion.
[03:32:42.921 --> 03:32:43.781]  Everything I do is about that.
[03:32:43.901 --> 03:32:47.304]  And so, victory is very close within our grasp right now.
[03:32:47.324 --> 03:32:48.365]  Now, let me stop right there.
[03:32:48.485 --> 03:32:53.069]  If you don't fund us, they'll have fun destroying me earlier than I think I'm supposed to be.
[03:32:53.089 --> 03:32:54.650]  Just remember, they say I'm failing.
[03:32:54.690 --> 03:32:55.711]  They say I'm going under.
[03:32:55.891 --> 03:32:58.333]  It's not true, but if you don't support us, we will.
[03:32:58.413 --> 03:32:59.654]  Right now at InfowarStore.com.
[03:33:06.087 --> 03:33:08.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:19.891 --> 03:33:20.811]  You found it!
[03:33:21.111 --> 03:33:22.652]  The tip of the spear!
[03:33:23.172 --> 03:33:25.593]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:26.153 --> 03:33:30.114]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[03:33:31.946 --> 03:33:32.366]  We're back.
[03:33:32.406 --> 03:33:37.751]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show and I'm joined by the thought criminal of the day.
[03:33:37.972 --> 03:33:40.574]  Here's Roosh V. It's rooshv.com.
[03:33:40.634 --> 03:33:44.598]  First, before we go to Roosh, I want to talk about this headline up on the Daily Beast.
[03:33:44.738 --> 03:33:48.461]  Amazon removes books by pro-rape leader Roosh Report.
[03:33:49.362 --> 03:33:52.465]  Now again, this point cannot be made sternly enough.
[03:33:53.326 --> 03:34:00.253]  If you don't support unpopular free speech, if you don't support offensive free speech, you don't support free speech!
[03:34:00.653 --> 03:34:03.315]  Because everything is offensive to somebody.
[03:34:03.816 --> 03:34:07.059]  Roosh V tweeted a satirical joke about rape three years ago.
[03:34:07.119 --> 03:34:07.980]  Yes, we know.
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:11.803]  We know that James Gunn tweeted about molesting kids years ago.
[03:34:12.063 --> 03:34:13.525]  Does he get the right to commerce?
[03:34:13.785 --> 03:34:15.306]  Does he get the right to a bank account?
[03:34:15.567 --> 03:34:16.167]  Yes, he does.
[03:34:17.108 --> 03:34:17.889]  Sarah Jonk
[03:34:18.570 --> 03:34:21.112]  Can tweet about exterminating white people.
[03:34:21.172 --> 03:34:22.673]  Does she get the right to commerce?
[03:34:22.733 --> 03:34:24.414]  Does she get the right to a bank account?
[03:34:24.674 --> 03:34:28.436]  Does she get the right to be verified by Twitter and given a job by the New York Times?
[03:34:28.737 --> 03:34:29.377]  Yes, she does.
[03:34:30.037 --> 03:34:30.798]  Peter Fonda.
[03:34:31.747 --> 03:34:34.489]  He can tweet about putting Barron Trump in a cage with paedophiles.
[03:34:34.509 --> 03:34:36.330]  Again, I'm offended by that.
[03:34:36.890 --> 03:34:41.252]  Should my offence stop him from having a bank account and engaging in commerce?
[03:34:41.652 --> 03:34:42.453]  No, it should not.
[03:34:42.693 --> 03:34:43.954]  This is a basic argument.
[03:34:44.254 --> 03:34:52.758]  Free speech has to include offensive speech or it doesn't matter a damn jot because everything is offensive to somebody.
[03:34:53.018 --> 03:34:53.879]  That is basic.
[03:34:54.611 --> 03:34:57.432]  That has been the understanding of free speech for decades and decades.
[03:34:57.732 --> 03:35:00.154]  That's the Supreme Court's understanding of free speech.
[03:35:00.554 --> 03:35:06.016]  And the fact that now probably a majority of Americans don't even know that is absolutely chilling.
[03:35:06.677 --> 03:35:08.077]  Roosh V, welcome to the show.
[03:35:08.097 --> 03:35:10.358]  Hey Paul, how are you?
[03:35:11.239 --> 03:35:16.321]  So what is your response to this Daily Beast headline calling you a pro-rape leader?
[03:35:17.975 --> 03:35:25.364]  Yeah, it's as if I have rape cells hiding everywhere and I'm just going to tell them to activate and rape one.
[03:35:25.444 --> 03:35:33.353]  It's the most absurd thing because they have no more arguments, so they just shame you with whatever label is most convenient for them to find.
[03:35:34.907 --> 03:35:35.787]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:35:35.827 --> 03:35:40.468]  And it's like, you know, just because I'm interviewing someone doesn't mean I have to agree with everything they say.
[03:35:40.929 --> 03:35:46.910]  They always dig up these old controversies about offensive things that people have said, like, like, I don't know about them.
[03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:48.370]  Like, oh, my God, did you hear about that?
[03:35:48.410 --> 03:35:49.871]  Yes, everyone knows about it.
[03:35:50.351 --> 03:35:51.931]  I support offensive free speech.
[03:35:52.251 --> 03:35:52.791]  I don't care.
[03:35:52.851 --> 03:35:54.672]  So let's move on to the actual issue, which is this.
[03:35:55.484 --> 03:36:03.627]  You know, back in 2009, Amazon digitally erased copies of Orwell's 1984 from customers' Kindle devices.
[03:36:04.067 --> 03:36:06.508]  That was over a copyright issue, if I remember rightly.
[03:36:06.948 --> 03:36:09.509]  But, you know, most people laughed at the irony of that at the time.
[03:36:10.089 --> 03:36:13.190]  A few people warned that it was a sign of things to come.
[03:36:13.571 --> 03:36:17.052]  Tell us what happened to you with Amazon over the course of the past few days.
[03:36:18.579 --> 03:36:18.939]  Yeah, sure.
[03:36:18.959 --> 03:36:24.364]  So I just was working on my newest book, my first book in one year.
[03:36:24.504 --> 03:36:25.404]  It's called Game.
[03:36:25.825 --> 03:36:28.807]  It's just a book that helps men how to meet women.
[03:36:29.187 --> 03:36:35.552]  As you see from the cover, it's a man and a woman sitting romantically under a tree.
[03:36:35.652 --> 03:36:36.153]  It's nothing
[03:36:36.633 --> 03:36:37.474]  I think so.
[03:36:57.154 --> 03:36:59.456]  Well, soon it jumped to number 698.
[03:36:59.516 --> 03:37:05.581]  And that's when the emails from Amazon started to come in.
[03:37:05.601 --> 03:37:07.403]  They first banned eight of my other books.
[03:37:07.763 --> 03:37:10.185]  Then on Monday, they banned this book, too.
[03:37:10.646 --> 03:37:14.569]  And to me, it seems like the trigger was that it was doing well.
[03:37:14.749 --> 03:37:19.793]  I had some other books that were ranked 50,000, been on Amazon for five years.
[03:37:19.853 --> 03:37:20.774]  They didn't do anything.
[03:37:21.014 --> 03:37:23.677]  But the second this book cracked the top 10,000,
[03:37:25.991 --> 03:37:27.411]  Amazon went on a rampage.
[03:37:29.172 --> 03:37:31.352]  Now, as you just said, it was doing really well.
[03:37:31.372 --> 03:37:33.613]  Do you think that was the reason why they took it down?
[03:37:33.653 --> 03:37:48.337]  Or was it also connected to this kind of stampede of censorship over the past month, where these brigades of hateful mobs have been rewarded and learned that they can organize, that they can put pressure on big companies to take people's content down?
[03:37:48.357 --> 03:37:49.817]  Do you think that was part of this too?
[03:37:50.914 --> 03:38:01.879]  I think what they start with is those people, the public figures who have the most influence to change what the narrative is, to change the globalist narrative, such as Alex Jones.
[03:38:03.399 --> 03:38:07.001]  If you're a small guy, they're probably not going to come after you first.
[03:38:07.561 --> 03:38:09.282]  So they're gonna get Alex Jones and then me.
[03:38:09.362 --> 03:38:12.764]  Anyone who is making a difference who's red-pilling a lot of people.
[03:38:13.144 --> 03:38:14.025]  That's what I think.
[03:38:14.125 --> 03:38:16.006]  I don't know because Amazon won't tell me.
[03:38:16.106 --> 03:38:17.587]  I've sent them a lot of emails.
[03:38:17.687 --> 03:38:18.428]  I've called them.
[03:38:18.828 --> 03:38:23.651]  They absolutely refuse to tell me which content guidelines I broke.
[03:38:23.951 --> 03:38:30.895]  It's like I got arrested for a crime but the judge won't tell me which crime I committed but I'm being sent to jail anyway.
[03:38:32.697 --> 03:38:36.539]  This is the essence of, you know, truly Kafka-esque societies.
[03:38:36.659 --> 03:38:42.743]  You know, when they banned InfoWars, when they suspended me on Twitter for 12 hours, there was no email whatsoever.
[03:38:42.783 --> 03:38:50.787]  They sent a selection of tweets a few days later, some of which had literally nothing to do with Alex Jones and said that they were hateful, they were harassment.
[03:38:50.827 --> 03:38:55.990]  But in most cases, they don't even tell you what thing you've broken, so then it's completely arbitrary.
[03:38:56.330 --> 03:38:57.491]  In fact, in your article,
[03:38:58.283 --> 03:39:01.845]  Which I also quoted from in the InfoWars article which is up on Drudge.
[03:39:02.426 --> 03:39:11.672]  You talk about how Amazon defines, I think, offensive content and their definition of what is offensive is so vague it's almost ridiculous, right?
[03:39:13.192 --> 03:39:14.894]  Yeah, I mean, they won't tell you.
[03:39:15.054 --> 03:39:23.224]  They say the official stance is that, quote, what is deemed offensive is what you think it is.
[03:39:23.765 --> 03:39:31.034]  That's their official policy, which gives them leeway to really whatever they want to say is offensive.
[03:39:31.694 --> 03:39:38.919]  Then that's going to be the case, because this book I have is way more tame than books like Fifty Shades of Grey.
[03:39:39.299 --> 03:39:45.563]  Amazon sells a lot of books that feature rape, child rape, how to manipulate men.
[03:39:45.963 --> 03:39:48.505]  They sell books on incest.
[03:39:48.965 --> 03:39:52.507]  They sell books on how gay men can travel and get sex.
[03:39:52.527 --> 03:39:56.370]  They sell a lot of stuff, and I'm not saying that they shouldn't, but my book
[03:39:57.017 --> 03:39:57.578]  We're good.
[03:40:11.437 --> 03:40:16.059]  You know, it's more based on who I am and what I'm trying to do.
[03:40:16.219 --> 03:40:22.381]  If I was trying to help transgender women find love, then they would feature it on their homepage.
[03:40:22.801 --> 03:40:29.423]  But the second you try to help straight men find love, uh-oh, that is a problem, and Amazon singles you out.
[03:40:29.783 --> 03:40:32.504]  So I think it's, they're trying to find out who you are.
[03:40:32.584 --> 03:40:38.346]  If you don't agree with them, they're gonna find some excuse in your content, your tweets, and your videos.
[03:40:38.766 --> 03:40:42.007]  When, like you pointed out, the left does far worse.
[03:40:44.047 --> 03:40:51.969]  Yeah, and going to that point which you just mentioned regarding, you know, if you were advocating for transgender dating or things like that, you'd be celebrated and worshipped.
[03:40:52.249 --> 03:40:55.949]  You know, we just got the largest study of men's fertility ever, I believe.
[03:40:55.989 --> 03:40:57.130]  The article came out today.
[03:40:57.170 --> 03:40:58.270]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:40:58.870 --> 03:41:01.911]  Men's sperm counts have dropped nearly 60% since the early 70s.
[03:41:01.931 --> 03:41:02.431]  I think
[03:41:04.355 --> 03:41:10.098]  They're talking about seeing male patients for fertility problems four times as much as they did a few years ago.
[03:41:10.158 --> 03:41:10.878]  It's exploded.
[03:41:10.898 --> 03:41:12.199]  The problem seems to be getting worse.
[03:41:12.799 --> 03:41:14.820]  They go through a list of reasons why that might be.
[03:41:15.680 --> 03:41:21.003]  But again, that appears to have largely affected white Western men more than anyone else.
[03:41:21.503 --> 03:41:27.366]  You know, we're constantly browbeaten that toxic masculinity is this big threat that needs to be eliminated.
[03:41:27.406 --> 03:41:31.108]  The whole incel movement, they've whipped up a lot of hysteria over that.
[03:41:31.952 --> 03:41:37.475]  Now do your books and message pose a threat to that cultural agenda to emasculate men?
[03:41:37.836 --> 03:41:42.599]  And could that be part of the reason, at least part of it, why Amazon has banned them?
[03:41:42.899 --> 03:41:49.683]  Because they see you as this kind of neo-masculinity figure that is trying to get men back to a situation
[03:41:50.365 --> 03:42:08.870]  You know, where they are confident, where they're not completely emasculated, and where they can actually be fruitful members of society and have stable, decent relationships in the long term, or at least be successful with women, not having been completely demoralized by this anti-masculine agenda in the mainstream media and in the popular culture.
[03:42:10.077 --> 03:42:17.040]  Yeah, the one thing I teach men is not to take abuse from women who cancel on them, flake on them, don't treat them right.
[03:42:17.300 --> 03:42:23.163]  Don't automatically give your respect to a woman just because she exists.
[03:42:23.603 --> 03:42:24.583]  She has to earn it.
[03:42:25.063 --> 03:42:28.465]  And I teach men, you know, to treat women just as good as they treat you.
[03:42:29.025 --> 03:42:31.026]  But this idea is now toxic.
[03:42:31.367 --> 03:42:34.268]  A man pursuing his own self-interest is toxic.
[03:42:34.488 --> 03:42:39.792]  While anyone else, if they pursue their own self-interest, is empowering and strong and brave.
[03:42:40.132 --> 03:42:44.975]  Just like how they put that large woman on the cover of Cosmopolitan.
[03:42:45.035 --> 03:42:48.097]  You have to worship her, but you can't help men.
[03:42:49.466 --> 03:42:50.487]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:42:51.047 --> 03:42:54.970]  The thought criminal du jour, Roosh V. And we'll be back on the other side of the break.
[03:42:54.990 --> 03:42:59.132]  The website is rooshv.com where you can still get his band book.
[03:42:59.172 --> 03:43:00.373]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:43:00.393 --> 03:43:01.113]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:01.153 --> 03:43:01.654]  Don't go away.
[03:43:02.836 --> 03:43:07.197]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:07.677 --> 03:43:16.598]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[03:43:17.138 --> 03:43:21.699]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[03:43:21.939 --> 03:43:32.261]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[03:43:33.501 --> 03:43:35.162]  Use a proprietary process.
[03:43:35.382 --> 03:43:42.063]  We've managed to make this powerhouse formula into a delicious, concentrated drink mix that's loaded with high quality ingredients.
[03:43:42.403 --> 03:43:50.784]  Perfect for a hot summer day or relaxing at home, Vitamin Mineral Fusion is loaded with 34 different essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids and more.
[03:43:51.204 --> 03:43:57.625]  Start supporting your body's needs in a great tasting, natural and affordable drink mix with Vitamin Mineral Fusion today.
[03:43:57.986 --> 03:44:00.246]  Available at Infowarsstore.com
[03:44:02.648 --> 03:44:06.093]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:44:06.613 --> 03:44:09.377]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:44:09.898 --> 03:44:15.726]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:44:16.186 --> 03:44:18.950]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:44:19.671 --> 03:44:23.114]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:44:23.495 --> 03:44:29.580]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:44:29.981 --> 03:44:34.925]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:44:35.686 --> 03:44:39.089]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:44:39.609 --> 03:44:46.154]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:44:46.814 --> 03:44:51.477]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:44:52.058 --> 03:44:57.141]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:44:57.722 --> 03:45:01.685]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:45:02.859 --> 03:45:05.820]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:06.380]  Go ahead.
[03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:12.201]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:45:12.401 --> 03:45:13.502]  I'd done the War Room.
[03:45:13.802 --> 03:45:16.262]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:45:16.282 --> 03:45:17.843]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:45:17.883 --> 03:45:18.623]  I was exhausted.
[03:45:18.823 --> 03:45:22.104]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[03:45:22.444 --> 03:45:27.065]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:45:27.165 --> 03:45:29.186]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:45:29.246 --> 03:45:29.726]  The same thing.
[03:45:30.086 --> 03:45:31.987]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at Infowars.
[03:45:32.107 --> 03:45:33.328]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:45:33.468 --> 03:45:35.590]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:45:35.610 --> 03:45:41.614]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[03:45:41.894 --> 03:45:42.735]  You can sleep with it.
[03:45:43.035 --> 03:45:47.358]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:45:47.418 --> 03:45:50.200]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:45:50.360 --> 03:45:52.081]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:45:52.181 --> 03:45:52.881]  It really works.
[03:45:53.101 --> 03:45:57.644]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[03:45:59.906 --> 03:46:00.286]  Believe me.
[03:46:02.988 --> 03:46:12.874]  Hey, by now I'm sure that most of you know that there are always big discounts and unbelievable savings on a regular basis at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:46:56.121 --> 03:46:56.321]  Yep!
[03:46:56.341 --> 03:46:57.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.716 --> 03:47:28.356]  News analysis reports it's the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:30.805 --> 03:47:39.191]  We basically have a situation whereby for months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[03:47:39.491 --> 03:47:43.534]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[03:47:43.954 --> 03:47:46.175]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[03:47:46.215 --> 03:47:48.337]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[03:47:48.677 --> 03:47:50.678]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[03:47:51.199 --> 03:47:51.479]  Boom!
[03:47:51.739 --> 03:47:53.981]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[03:47:54.321 --> 03:47:55.902]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[03:47:55.962 --> 03:47:57.783]  You still have InfoWall Store.
[03:47:57.823 --> 03:47:58.924]  You still have a shop front.
[03:47:59.767 --> 03:48:00.527]  And then what do we see?
[03:48:00.827 --> 03:48:01.648]  Washington Post.
[03:48:02.148 --> 03:48:05.269]  Oh my God, traffic to Alex Jones' Infowars store has increased by 50%.
[03:48:06.649 --> 03:48:08.470]  Maybe now we should look at that.
[03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:10.710]  That's an awful nice shop front you've got there.
[03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:13.751]  Maybe let's put some pressure on the payment processors.
[03:48:14.231 --> 03:48:18.152]  All the way down the line, they literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[03:48:18.572 --> 03:48:22.934]  Robert Spencer's right to basically have a Mastercard account linked to his Patreon.
[03:48:23.334 --> 03:48:24.834]  That was deemed hateful.
[03:48:25.234 --> 03:48:26.055]  That was cancelled.
[03:48:26.075 --> 03:48:27.135]  I think he got it back in the end.
[03:48:27.495 --> 03:48:30.677]  But this just shows you the absolute intensification of this.
[03:48:30.977 --> 03:48:36.361]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:48:37.468 --> 03:48:43.413]  We have the second-to-last run special on Super Male Vitality, a massive 50% off.
[03:48:43.453 --> 03:48:44.574]  We're dropping the price again.
[03:48:45.014 --> 03:48:46.495]  Thousands of five-star reviews.
[03:48:46.535 --> 03:48:48.457]  You can go to the website and read them for yourself.
[03:48:48.877 --> 03:48:50.819]  Listeners have been blown away by the effects.
[03:48:51.259 --> 03:48:57.544]  It is the game-changing formula that uses ancient wisdom and modern equipment to boost your male vitality and help you fight fatigue easily.
[03:48:57.884 --> 03:49:00.226]  You can go and see the independent reviews for yourself.
[03:49:00.606 --> 03:49:01.406]  We're good to go.
[03:49:22.478 --> 03:49:26.262]  Well, we have a massive 50% off right now on Supermail Vitality.
[03:49:26.602 --> 03:49:28.223]  Go there and get it today.
[03:49:28.744 --> 03:49:36.791]  Going back to our guest now, Roosh V, whose books have been banned by the digital Nazi book burners over at Amazon.com.
[03:49:37.112 --> 03:49:40.214]  I think it's nine out of 19 have been banned so far.
[03:49:41.215 --> 03:49:42.897]  Roosh, I put up this tweet earlier today.
[03:49:43.948 --> 03:49:44.449]  The year is 2050.
[03:49:45.611 --> 03:49:54.123]  After transcending into the singularity and going full cyborg, Mark Zuckerberg's oxygen book has literally bought the atmosphere over the entire planet.
[03:49:54.563 --> 03:49:57.147]  Thought criminals have been banned from breathing.
[03:49:57.548 --> 03:50:00.292]  But establishment conservatives respond in unison.
[03:50:00.868 --> 03:50:02.389]  But they're a private company.
[03:50:02.809 --> 03:50:04.431]  At least it's not the government.
[03:50:04.851 --> 03:50:07.633]  What do you think about this tired line we hear over and over again?
[03:50:07.973 --> 03:50:13.917]  This private company argument from conservatives every time this happens, every time it intensifies.
[03:50:15.118 --> 03:50:16.019]  It's okay, Paul.
[03:50:16.039 --> 03:50:18.741]  We're going to build our own atmosphere.
[03:50:18.801 --> 03:50:21.002]  We're going to build our own Amazon, our own internet.
[03:50:21.142 --> 03:50:24.985]  I'm laying fiber optic cables under the Atlantic Ocean right now.
[03:50:25.625 --> 03:50:30.329]  But, you know, what they're doing is, if a baker doesn't want to bake a cake,
[03:50:31.227 --> 03:50:32.068]  They get on him.
[03:50:32.108 --> 03:50:39.274]  He's homophobic, racist, even though there's a hundred bakeries down the street from him.
[03:50:39.774 --> 03:50:44.598]  But now, if you don't say the right things, they kick you off of Facebook.
[03:50:44.618 --> 03:50:48.582]  They say, well, build your own social networking, but there's no other Facebook.
[03:50:48.622 --> 03:50:52.525]  These are tech monopolies that dominate their sector completely.
[03:50:52.965 --> 03:50:54.487]  Amazon dominates books.
[03:50:55.087 --> 03:50:58.150]  They sell over 40% of books in the USA.
[03:50:59.070 --> 03:51:01.612]  And I mean, there's no alternative.
[03:51:01.692 --> 03:51:06.415]  These are monopolies, and I don't trust the government to get involved.
[03:51:06.555 --> 03:51:07.356]  I don't trust them.
[03:51:07.796 --> 03:51:10.278]  Usually what they touch, it goes bad.
[03:51:10.338 --> 03:51:15.821]  But if the government doesn't do something, these companies are going to keep on ruining people's livelihood.
[03:51:15.922 --> 03:51:19.424]  And when they do, they're going to send you an email and not even explain it.
[03:51:19.864 --> 03:51:24.688]  So it's very convenient for the left to say it's a private business when we get banned.
[03:51:25.069 --> 03:51:32.535]  But when of their own, you don't bake a cake, then they lose their minds and they start suing you and put a bakery out of business.
[03:51:32.796 --> 03:51:36.639]  So they only use that argument when it protects themselves.
[03:51:38.280 --> 03:51:41.043]  And another example where they lost their minds, which ties into that
[03:51:41.966 --> 03:51:45.189]  There was a Think Progress article, which is another far-left website.
[03:51:45.209 --> 03:51:49.853]  It's by far from being a, you know, a credible centrist website or however they want to present it.
[03:51:50.073 --> 03:51:54.396]  There was a Think Progress article on Facebook, weekly standard.
[03:51:54.717 --> 03:51:59.701]  So Facebook's literally got like one fact-checker who isn't Snopes and the Associated Press.
[03:51:59.861 --> 03:52:04.345]  One fact-checker who's like this, you know, establishment conservative group weekly standard.
[03:52:04.885 --> 03:52:08.008]  Fact-checked a Think Progress article, found it to be inaccurate.
[03:52:08.528 --> 03:52:10.750]  People absolutely lost their minds.
[03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:13.813]  The verified checkmarks on Twitter lost their minds.
[03:52:14.334 --> 03:52:17.536]  I often hear people say, you know, watch out!
[03:52:17.577 --> 03:52:21.560]  The censorship that progressives instigated will eventually boomerang back on them.
[03:52:21.880 --> 03:52:22.741]  I don't really see that.
[03:52:23.502 --> 03:52:26.285]  The example that you gave, they don't get their gay wedding cake.
[03:52:26.305 --> 03:52:29.648]  They can literally go to the baker down the road and get their gay wedding cake.
[03:52:29.688 --> 03:52:30.909]  It's not the same scenario.
[03:52:31.508 --> 03:52:34.670]  You know, we have, you know, the James Gunn firing, things like that.
[03:52:34.730 --> 03:52:38.532]  I didn't support that in spirit, but that's basically the only example in recent times.
[03:52:38.812 --> 03:52:41.233]  But again, he's not stopped from engaging in commerce.
[03:52:41.753 --> 03:52:43.294]  You know, they own Silicon Valley.
[03:52:43.554 --> 03:52:47.676]  I don't see a deluge of left-wingers being banned anytime soon.
[03:52:47.716 --> 03:52:50.998]  I don't see this boomeranging back on them anytime soon.
[03:52:51.058 --> 03:52:51.298]  Do you?
[03:52:52.995 --> 03:52:59.721]  I think it's going to start with those who are to the left of the Democratic Party, those who support Bernie Sanders.
[03:52:59.781 --> 03:53:04.205]  They had their primary election and the last election rigged.
[03:53:04.466 --> 03:53:15.636]  So I think unless your opinion perfectly fits with those who control Amazon, Facebook, any global 500 companies, oil companies, all these companies, unless your opinion matches them,
[03:53:16.448 --> 03:53:18.309]  You could be on the chopping block.
[03:53:18.349 --> 03:53:22.211]  They're going to start with those who have the most influence first and work their way down.
[03:53:22.591 --> 03:53:34.056]  But one thing is that even in the private sector, you don't know how many emails I get from men who are scared to speak their mind at work, who are scared just to have a chat with the female at work.
[03:53:34.457 --> 03:53:37.098]  Many men have been fired and these are the quiet
[03:53:37.698 --> 03:53:40.699]  Victims, because when I get banned, everyone is going to know about it.
[03:53:40.759 --> 03:53:50.983]  But an average Joe who has a middle class job, when they fire him because he made a spicy joke at work, he doesn't have anywhere to really go.
[03:53:51.103 --> 03:53:53.064]  So it's happening to us.
[03:53:53.244 --> 03:53:54.904]  Is it going to happen to the left?
[03:53:55.065 --> 03:54:01.387]  I think once they run out of victims on the right, once they run out of guys like Alex Jones and me and everyone else,
[03:54:02.087 --> 03:54:06.309]  Where else is this gun that they're firing going to go on?
[03:54:06.509 --> 03:54:08.770]  Because they want complete compliance.
[03:54:09.130 --> 03:54:10.450]  You have to agree with them.
[03:54:10.510 --> 03:54:13.051]  You cannot have a deviation of thought.
[03:54:13.411 --> 03:54:16.693]  So right now, the biggest deviants are people like us.
[03:54:17.293 --> 03:54:25.036]  But those on the left, they're starting to overthrow some of these longtime Democratic incumbents in Congress.
[03:54:25.176 --> 03:54:26.997]  They are going to be next.
[03:54:27.117 --> 03:54:30.198]  It's, you know, me today, you tomorrow.
[03:54:31.972 --> 03:54:41.984]  I mean it's incredible, you talk there about people in the workplace and how they basically can barely even talk to women at this point without being at least under threat, thinking they would get some backlash from that.
[03:54:42.325 --> 03:54:51.336]  There was a study a few months ago, I did a video on this, 25% of US millennials think that asking a woman for a drink is a form of sexual harassment.
[03:54:51.716 --> 03:54:53.738]  That was literally what came out of one of the polls.
[03:54:54.398 --> 03:54:58.062]  So this book is the most sexual harassing book ever, you know?
[03:54:58.342 --> 03:55:07.349]  And that's why it can't be tolerated, I mean, because basically you're giving young men a message of just self-confidence and for some reason that is a massive threat to the current system.
[03:55:07.390 --> 03:55:11.353]  How can giving young men self-confidence be that much of a threat?
[03:55:12.412 --> 03:55:16.434]  You can't empower men because they see it as zero-sum game.
[03:55:16.795 --> 03:55:28.582]  If men are getting what they want out of life, then there must be some toxic masculinity conspiracy theory that's holding women down, preventing them from education, preventing them from jobs.
[03:55:29.222 --> 03:55:34.385]  You know, they all say that only women have to be helped at the same time men are pushed down.
[03:55:34.425 --> 03:55:44.730]  That's the only way we can create our gender utopia and right the wrongs of 10,000 years ago when we lived in tribes and patriarchal societies.
[03:55:45.090 --> 03:55:54.454]  I mean, it's a real sick mindset that you today have to suffer because 500 years ago, some man somewhere didn't allow women to vote.
[03:55:54.794 --> 03:55:57.916]  But I can tell you, Paul, there is nothing a woman can do
[03:55:58.616 --> 03:56:00.197]  Can't do today that I can do.
[03:56:00.337 --> 03:56:01.578]  Women can do anything they want.
[03:56:01.678 --> 03:56:07.581]  They can work hard, they can go to school, they can buy any products that they want, they can say whatever they want.
[03:56:08.021 --> 03:56:10.702]  But now men can't, especially if you're a straight man.
[03:56:10.742 --> 03:56:15.324]  That's why a lot of men I know, now they say at work they pretend to be gay.
[03:56:15.785 --> 03:56:19.907]  They said that gives them a shield to not get attacked.
[03:56:20.247 --> 03:56:23.148]  To, you know, play the gay, to play the gay card.
[03:56:23.588 --> 03:56:24.649]  And that's how bad it is.
[03:56:26.158 --> 03:56:26.698]  Incredible.
[03:56:26.718 --> 03:56:27.499]  Got about a minute left.
[03:56:27.539 --> 03:56:32.380]  Just tell people where they can still get this banned book for the time being, where they can go to get it.
[03:56:33.521 --> 03:56:46.045]  Yeah, so right now the paperback copy on Amazon is gone, but you can still order the e-book and the audiobook directly from my web store, and you can find the links at rooshv.com.
[03:56:46.785 --> 03:56:54.248]  And, you know, thankfully most people read books now on e-books instead of paperback, so I hope this is just a speed bump.
[03:56:54.788 --> 03:57:03.953]  You know, and I hope what's happening to Alex Jones also is a speed bump, but they're going after him extremely hard, and I hope he is strong enough to overcome this.
[03:57:04.033 --> 03:57:14.339]  But, yeah, if people do want to read about what Amazon, the basic dating advice that Amazon wants to ban, they can go to my website, rooshv.com.
[03:57:15.500 --> 03:57:17.541]  Okay, there goes a thought criminal of the day.
[03:57:17.561 --> 03:57:19.062]  We'll be sure to stay on top of this story.
[03:57:19.082 --> 03:57:20.523]  Roosh V, thanks for joining us.
[03:57:21.283 --> 03:57:22.064]  Okay, thank you, Paul.
[03:57:22.819 --> 03:57:23.219]  Thank you.
[03:57:23.620 --> 03:57:25.802]  That is gonna wrap up the show.
[03:57:25.862 --> 03:57:29.365]  Again, please support us by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:29.785 --> 03:57:31.267]  Massive specials right now.
[03:57:31.747 --> 03:57:36.552]  Massive sustained attack that we've been under and will continue to be under for a long time yet.
[03:57:36.632 --> 03:57:38.954]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:57:39.314 --> 03:57:41.416]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:41.456 --> 03:57:42.197]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:57:42.557 --> 03:57:42.998]  We'll be back.
[03:57:52.208 --> 03:57:57.251]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:57:57.392 --> 03:58:02.275]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver.
[03:58:02.335 --> 03:58:05.597]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:58:05.617 --> 03:58:14.483]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first aid, management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[03:58:14.703 --> 03:58:16.945]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:58:17.045 --> 03:58:19.046]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[03:58:19.226 --> 03:58:20.227]  It's just incredible.
[03:58:20.387 --> 03:58:21.968]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[03:58:22.068 --> 03:58:23.249]  This is next level.
[03:58:23.289 --> 03:58:24.850]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:58:25.391 --> 03:58:29.534]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:58:29.874 --> 03:58:34.297]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:58:34.417 --> 03:58:37.860]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:58:37.880 --> 03:58:39.281]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:58:39.441 --> 03:58:42.263]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:58:42.483 --> 03:58:42.883]  We're good to go.
