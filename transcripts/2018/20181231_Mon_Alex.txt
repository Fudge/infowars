[00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.177]  I mean, there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:27.666]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.148]  Scum!
[00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:32.249]  Russian scum!
[00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:43.614]  Reputation's amazing.
[00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:45.095]  I will not let you down.
[00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:47.976]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.922]  It is the final Alex Jones Show of 2018.
[00:01:30.922 --> 00:01:36.623]  What a year!
[00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:43.505]  And I gotta say, really sitting back and thinking, it's been a good year.
[00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.525]  It's been a rough year.
[00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:47.966]  It's been hard fought.
[00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.387]  And a lot of good things happened and a lot of bad things happened.
[00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:55.848]  But in the final summation, if you read establishment publications,
[00:01:58.331 --> 00:02:19.122]  Like the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times of London, and Atlantic Monthly, where the globalists communicate with each other, they are licking grievous wounds and openly talking about how they're losing their world government.
[00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:30.839]  And how nationalism and Christianity and populism is exploding, and they talk about how they're going to counter it, and that's by creating global race war.
[00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:38.327]  If you study how the British would control India with only a few thousand troops for over 200 years, they called it the Great Game.
[00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:42.451]  And they wrote about it in British newspapers.
[00:02:43.757 --> 00:03:01.009]  Until the 1900s and Indians started moving to England some and started sending newspapers back where the British government was talking about how they would play different tribes off against each other and how they sent sociologists in to learn how to manipulate them.
[00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.812]  They did it in Afghanistan, Pakistan, you name it.
[00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:07.594]  But here's a Wall Street Journal article out today
[00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:14.184]  2018 biggest loser was the Liberal International Order.
[00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:27.411]  When they mean liberal, they mean big mega banks above the law that pay no taxes, spying on you with big tech, and creating cultural division, and destroying the first world in a reverse colonial operation.
[00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:32.685]  Which also hurts the third world as well.
[00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:46.395]  So, humanity started to get its footing in 2016, and you saw a lot of prosperity come back because Trump could just wrest the wheel of the economy away from the private Federal Reserve a little bit.
[00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:53.181]  He got a little bit of a course correction, but it was like a man coming up from deep water and finally getting a breath.
[00:03:55.452 --> 00:04:01.917]  But they've shoved our face right back in the water as fast as they can and are now blaming Trump.
[00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:09.243]  So as we accelerate into 2019, all I can say is start your engines.
[00:04:09.243 --> 00:04:16.429]  Strap yourselves in and get ready because it's going to be the year of the globalist counter-offensive.
[00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:24.196]  84 new investigations that these different committees are going to fire up in T-minus
[00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:30.498]  Three days.
[00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:39.501]  Three days, ladies and gentlemen, until all of this kicks in.
[00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:40.662]  And so, brace yourselves.
[00:04:40.662 --> 00:04:47.744]  But the good news is, humanity's coming out of the trance and is realizing we're in a fight.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.862]  And we've got a good shot at this if we get on our knees and pray to God and then take action.
[00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:55.003]  Big broadcast today.
[00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.644]  A lot of big guests.
[00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:57.624]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:04:57.624 --> 00:05:00.266]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.967]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember...
[00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:06.053]  This life is a test.
[00:05:06.053 --> 00:05:18.283]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:28.270]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.433]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:37.021]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:39.682]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[00:05:39.682 --> 00:05:43.503]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:44.324]  2018 has been insane.
[00:05:44.324 --> 00:05:47.805]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker.
[00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:51.667]  And I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:55.348]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[00:05:55.348 --> 00:05:59.430]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[00:06:06.897 --> 00:06:23.146]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:30.611]  Well, I began to really say it more than ten years ago, on air and in speeches.
[00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:34.353]  My speeches aren't prepared, I don't write them down, they're not done by
[00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:39.538]  Speechwriters, they just come from my gut and from history.
[00:06:39.538 --> 00:06:50.485]  But I began to have a little saying that I don't know how all of this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:58.090]  And you see humanity all over the globe awakening to the globalist paradigm and the fact that it is authoritarian cancer.
[00:06:59.574 --> 00:07:13.949]  And even the Wall Street Journal, even the Financial Times of London and others today have articles out admitting that the liberal world government, global governance, has been shot to pieces.
[00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:14.970]  It's like Humpty Dumpty.
[00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:27.688]  But you've got Merkel in a speech she gave this weekend, repeating what she said last week, that the enemy of nation-states, we must get rid of nation-states, just like Macron said, the greatest form of patriotism is not having a country.
[00:07:27.688 --> 00:07:29.069]  These are quotes.
[00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:30.150]  Can't make this up.
[00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:38.116]  That they need 200 million Africans just in France alone, and that Africa is the heart of France, and the birthplace of France.
[00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:39.437]  And you say, that doesn't make sense.
[00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:41.359]  That's upside-down world.
[00:07:41.359 --> 00:07:42.880]  It's meant to break your will.
[00:07:45.373 --> 00:07:46.294]  They're testing.
[00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:47.735]  That's why, what did Merkel say?
[00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:52.698]  She said, we shouldn't care what our nation's people think.
[00:07:52.698 --> 00:07:57.080]  We need to totally open the borders and merge with the Middle East and Africa.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.602]  And we need an orderly governance to do this.
[00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:04.285]  And she's back in the news today, saying we need a government to oversee it.
[00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:10.145]  And of course, who is that?
[00:08:10.145 --> 00:08:13.210]  Oh, it's the European Union and the UN.
[00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.091]  Oh, I see.
[00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:16.195]  They build the refugee camps.
[00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.877]  They suck off the third world.
[00:08:17.877 --> 00:08:19.720]  They organize the giant hordes.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.042]  They then collapse the borders.
[00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.166]  They bring in the first wave of 15 million.
[00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:26.929]  Tourism goes down 80-plus percent.
[00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:29.110]  No-go zones all over Europe.
[00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:38.477]  Top French police, top Danish police, top German police, top Swedish police all say we are failed societies in the last month.
[00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:40.118]  They said we are in a war.
[00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.280]  Why are you collapsing everything?
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.000]  No one's coming for terrorism.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.701]  There's murder all over the place.
[00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:48.661]  Mass rape.
[00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.621]  The leftist judges are releasing the Muslims when they do it.
[00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:52.582]  Hand grenade attack.
[00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.322]  Machine gun attacks every day.
[00:08:54.322 --> 00:08:56.623]  Mass plowing attacks every day.
[00:08:56.623 --> 00:08:59.143]  Until Sadiq Khan's proven right.
[00:08:59.143 --> 00:09:01.064]  The Islamic mayor of London.
[00:09:01.064 --> 00:09:01.764]  The jihadi mayor.
[00:09:01.764 --> 00:09:05.525]  He said, just get used to it two years ago.
[00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:06.625]  Then he said it again this year.
[00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:07.385]  Just get used to it.
[00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:12.058]  And you know, I've actually gotten used to it.
[00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:24.971]  Where there's so many articles on Infowars.com and Newswars.com and Europewars.com that link to more mass rapes, more mass killings, more machine gun attacks.
[00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:28.154]  Now they just admit that whole sections of major cities.
[00:09:28.154 --> 00:09:32.718]  I was looking at maps in Germany and Sweden of where they won't deliver mail
[00:09:33.399 --> 00:10:02.707]  Where plumbers won't come, and so there's now feces everywhere, and broken sewage, and the Islamicists are almost all on welfare, walking around in nightgowns, the men, just lazy, stupid jackasses, arrogant, brought in as the Trojan horse, and then Merkel says, and Macron says, the answer is having the EU army and navy orderly bring in more.
[00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:05.867]  Which was always the plan.
[00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:11.870]  Oh, and the second bigger caravan, they're not saying it's 200, then it was 50,000 for that.
[00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:20.535]  Now they're admitting it's 50,000 are massing in Honduras and Guatemala for the next invasion force.
[00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:24.757]  And Beto O'Rourke tweeted out over the weekend that he was so pleased.
[00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:36.812]  That thousands a day of the illegal aliens are just being released because they don't have jails, they don't have ICE facilities, and the judges are just saying, release them.
[00:10:36.812 --> 00:10:38.353]  Release them.
[00:10:38.353 --> 00:10:44.138]  You can get here, you make it across, you're in Grotus.
[00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:49.522]  And if they collapse us, it's done.
[00:10:49.522 --> 00:10:50.403]  So the president
[00:10:51.664 --> 00:11:09.601]  Understands the world's awakening to globalism and how big megacorporations, they have their own armored fortresses, from the Vatican, it's a megacorporation, to Google, it's a big megacorporation, to the Democratic Party and the multiple 10-foot walls they've got and 20-foot walls around their houses, like Obama!
[00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:15.206]  We've sent cameras to Obama's second White House, a mile from the real White House.
[00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.254]  It's got two walls around it, just like Zuckerberg's got big walls.
[00:11:21.254 --> 00:11:29.262]  Everybody else has got big walls, but you can't have walls.
[00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:36.208]  And so Trump's desperately trying to have a big wall, and then they start going, oh, now you want big metal slats.
[00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:37.129]  Well, that's a wall.
[00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:40.421]  And the military says it's the best design.
[00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:41.662]  Oh, you lied to us!
[00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:44.244]  So he's the bad one because he can't get him to act.
[00:11:44.244 --> 00:11:52.951]  And he stood up to him and shut down the government and is asking for enough to repair what's there and fill up all the other critical sectors.
[00:11:52.951 --> 00:11:58.676]  And because he's trying, he's the bad guy.
[00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:06.322]  Meanwhile, Pocahontas has announced she's running for president.
[00:12:06.322 --> 00:12:07.343]  It's an amazing time.
[00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:12.929]  To be alive.
[00:12:12.929 --> 00:12:25.172]  And of course the censorship is heating up, so they want to plunge economies of nationalist countries, that's what the globals are doing, to teach Italy a lesson and the US a lesson and the UK a lesson.
[00:12:25.172 --> 00:12:35.374]  They're on the news saying, we're going to shut your stock markets down and plunge your pensions if you don't sign on to the EU and if you don't sign on to open borders and if you don't sign on to globalism.
[00:12:35.374 --> 00:12:36.455]  And the average person
[00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:42.417]  Doesn't take that as the ultimatum and as the terrorism, the financial terrorism it is.
[00:12:42.417 --> 00:12:45.378]  It's just kind of like, oh yeah, see, the economy's plunging.
[00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:46.819]  Better get in line, Trump.
[00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:53.022]  And top neocons have joined all these Democrats on TV saying, yeah, the economy's going down.
[00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.022]  Now we can impeach Trump.
[00:12:55.022 --> 00:12:58.564]  Cheerleading our own collapse.
[00:12:58.564 --> 00:12:59.744]  And this is a good thing.
[00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:03.726]  These are the good guys.
[00:13:03.726 --> 00:13:05.687]  No, these are not the good guys.
[00:13:07.073 --> 00:13:10.795]  They're open, they're coming after our children.
[00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:16.239]  There isn't one taboo they don't want to break because they want our will broken.
[00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:25.885]  This is called, when you occupy a nation, the only way to make them give up to a foreign occupier is called one word, demoralization.
[00:13:25.885 --> 00:13:29.968]  There's one way unless you kill everybody.
[00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:32.029]  And that is to demoralize them.
[00:13:33.134 --> 00:13:37.397]  And you read the WikiLeaks, and you read the Financial Times of London, this stuff's public.
[00:13:37.397 --> 00:13:38.697]  And what do they say?
[00:13:38.697 --> 00:13:40.999]  The answer is culture war.
[00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:44.901]  Racial and division between the sexes.
[00:13:44.901 --> 00:13:48.584]  A modern great game of divide and conquer.
[00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:54.451]  And they sit there in people's faces saying they're doing it like we're not even human.
[00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:57.973]  They're up there above us going, oh, just escalate race war.
[00:13:57.973 --> 00:14:02.174]  Every major movie's about whites being mean to blacks or women being oppressed.
[00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:11.038]  And it's being done by the ruling horrible evil globalists that are backing radical Islam, literally mass murdering and enslaving women all over the planet.
[00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:14.620]  And not a damn word out of the filthy feminists, because they're not feminists.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.581]  They're whores of the pimp state.
[00:14:20.086 --> 00:14:26.431]  And they deliver their sons to be chemically castrated and to be put on Ritalin and Prozac because the government said so.
[00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:31.395]  And they feminize their sons as an act of attacking any form of resistance.
[00:14:31.395 --> 00:14:33.536]  They are agents of evil.
[00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:38.300]  They are collaborators.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:45.885]  Oh, and where was Franklin Graham and where was the Christian Coalition and all these groups when I got taken off the internet?
[00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:46.326]  Not a word.
[00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:58.456]  Oh, and then all the other libertarians and conservatives, and now Michael Savage is having his show taken away, and it's being, but he can't talk about it because of the contract, I can, and it's being given to Shapiro.
[00:14:58.456 --> 00:15:10.843]  I warned everyone, and now Franklin Graham AP reports, well, one of the 15,000 fact-checkers that Facebook employs, trained by the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:23.202]  And, uh, Media Matters, that's on record, actually says it, was mistaken for a post from 2016 where Franklin Graham said that there was, you know, two genders and some other things.
[00:15:23.202 --> 00:15:25.564]  And they said, this is dehumanization.
[00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:33.768]  But when they went, wait, you just went after a guy with at least 50 million members, they might actually get Congress to do something.
[00:15:33.768 --> 00:15:38.611]  Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, you can stay, you can stay.
[00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:39.732]  See how that works?
[00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:41.554]  What's the real dehumanization?
[00:15:41.554 --> 00:15:48.579]  It's coming in and teaching a five-year-old girl or boy that they're another sex and totally molesting their mind and screwing them up.
[00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:55.767]  Because you're running a larger global government project of depopulation and destruction of the family, which is on record.
[00:15:55.767 --> 00:15:57.469]  That's the dehumanization!
[00:15:57.469 --> 00:15:59.371]  That's what this big tech does!

[00:17:28.644 --> 00:17:34.987]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:38.029]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:43.952]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.952 --> 00:17:47.754]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:49.014]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:49.014 --> 00:17:50.355]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.355 --> 00:17:56.558]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.558 --> 00:17:57.999]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:05.996]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:19:05.996 --> 00:19:15.763]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:23.849]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:19:24.838 --> 00:19:32.764]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:19:32.764 --> 00:19:35.867]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:19:35.867 --> 00:19:37.368]  It really is amazing.
[00:19:37.368 --> 00:19:44.073]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:46.696]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:19:48.047 --> 00:19:49.588]  Of Infowars.
[00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:50.888]  So please spread the links.

[00:19:57.552 --> 00:19:58.872]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:19:58.872 --> 00:20:03.274]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:20:03.274 --> 00:20:05.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:47.545]  Now I do want to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today.
[00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:51.546]  We also have several guests joining us, but I do want to open the phones up to give
[00:20:52.844 --> 00:21:05.447]  The world your take on what you think of 2018 and the job President Trump's doing and what he should do to fight the globalists and any other topics you want to raise concerning 2018 and what you see coming in 2019.
[00:21:05.447 --> 00:21:11.529]  And the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:15.510]  I want to give first-time callers in the first round a chance to call in.
[00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.891]  First-time callers 877-789-ALEX.
[00:21:18.969 --> 00:21:20.450]  789-2539.
[00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:29.275]  That's 877-789-2539.
[00:21:29.275 --> 00:21:31.677]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:21:31.677 --> 00:21:34.659]  Now let me just do this in this little short segment.
[00:21:34.659 --> 00:21:38.961]  Let me just mention some of the news we're going to be going over.
[00:21:38.961 --> 00:21:43.164]  Isn't it illustrative that Mattis
[00:21:44.818 --> 00:21:52.201]  And Kelly, the outgoing generals that Trump brought in, both have made jabs at the President.
[00:21:52.201 --> 00:22:09.769]  And I was told by really informed sources that they basically deceived the President and told him everything that he wanted to hear about how they would back him and how they would make America great again, people, back when
[00:22:11.061 --> 00:22:17.430]  Someone who he really was listening at the time was his, quote, chief advisor.
[00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.955]  And that, of course, was Stephen Bannon.
[00:22:20.955 --> 00:22:22.538]  Now diminished, but still very dangerous.
[00:22:26.588 --> 00:22:30.490]  He tries to put his fingers in everything, his hands on everything.
[00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.872]  He tries to claim credit for what's happening in the worldwide revolution.
[00:22:33.872 --> 00:22:41.855]  He tries to go around wars that are already going on and put himself on a horse at the head of it and act like once a war is already going that, you know, he's the commander.
[00:22:41.855 --> 00:22:44.877]  That's when he's not hanging around with disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:22:48.424 --> 00:22:55.009]  You know the liberal press, there's no pedophilia going on at the Catholic Church, all these big groups, universities, governmental organizations.
[00:22:55.009 --> 00:23:00.974]  I mean, you can't swing a stick at any power structure and not hit a pedophile or people hanging out with pedophiles.
[00:23:00.974 --> 00:23:03.256]  But I digress.
[00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:13.303]  And I remember not going after Bannon a year and a half ago, just because he was in the White House when I was hearing all this, and not going after Kelly and not going after Mattis.
[00:23:13.303 --> 00:23:15.225]  Mad dog Mattis!
[00:23:15.225 --> 00:23:17.487]  And he always tries to act real scary and tough.
[00:23:18.618 --> 00:23:24.941]  I mean, the guy led an attack on Fallujah and said, kill all the men.
[00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:27.002]  I mean, that's routine.
[00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:27.302]  Okay.
[00:23:27.302 --> 00:23:28.703]  I mean, compared to other generals in U.S.
[00:23:28.703 --> 00:23:30.244]  history, he's a joke.
[00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:36.487]  But see, oh, I mean, I knew he was bad because the media is always mad dog mad as he's good.
[00:23:36.487 --> 00:23:40.489]  Oh, John Kelly, they're the adults in the room with Trump.
[00:23:40.489 --> 00:23:42.550]  And I was like, man, this doesn't look good.
[00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:50.789]  And now they're involved in their jabs as they go.
[00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:56.192]  I mean, if they need a new person to play Emperor Palpatine, Mattis has got that look going.
[00:23:56.192 --> 00:24:00.334]  I mean, I got some bags under my eyes, but boy, you could milk those.
[00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:01.375]  They could run like a dairy.
[00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:05.697]  There's like cow udders hanging below his eyes.
[00:24:05.697 --> 00:24:07.018]  And I've gone and looked at his record.
[00:24:07.018 --> 00:24:13.142]  I mean, the leftist CNN's like, maybe the greatest general in U.S.
[00:24:13.142 --> 00:24:13.562]  history.
[00:24:14.952 --> 00:24:15.793]  Wow!
[00:24:15.793 --> 00:24:27.361]  I mean he's not even in the league with George Washington or Andrew Jackson or Patton or the list goes on and on.
[00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:29.583]  I mean it's joke level.
[00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:30.784]  Oh and then John Kelly.
[00:24:33.387 --> 00:24:39.791]  I mean, he at least did try to stop Al-Qaeda and Grimsley was the head of Southcom coming in and did do some good things on the border.
[00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:47.337]  But these guys all got where they are because they're social climbers and they're yes men.
[00:24:47.337 --> 00:24:52.660]  And so when you get up to colonels and above, they belong to the deep state.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:25:00.826]  Even if they aren't out to get the country, they are part of that structure and they all try to cover their butts.
[00:25:02.907 --> 00:25:14.175]  And so they'll say one thing to one person, and another thing to another person, and I think that's real Machiavelli and real smart, and it's so sycophantic in D.C.
[00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:20.199]  It's a bunch of un-American garbage.
[00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:21.620]  All kissing each other's butts.
[00:25:23.431 --> 00:25:41.967]  All selling out America's power, and America's industry, and America's largesse, and telling themselves what geniuses they are with this global government they've set up, when all they've done is set up the CHICOMS to be in a superior position to us, and let our technology, all of it, big tech, everything, move there!
[00:25:44.198 --> 00:25:48.600]  And totally betray us, and then along comes somebody that says, why are we doing this?
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.381]  Even if you were Machiavelli, you'd parlay American power into dominance.
[00:25:52.381 --> 00:25:56.403]  You wouldn't get rid of it, you idiots!
[00:25:56.403 --> 00:25:58.864]  But, you see, it's spiritual.
[00:25:58.864 --> 00:26:01.385]  And they come from a bunch of sellouts.
[00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:11.629]  And yes men, positioned by globalists, show their pedigree, is they claim, oh, they're patriotic, and they love the country, but they don't.
[00:26:11.629 --> 00:26:12.149]  They don't.
[00:26:14.397 --> 00:26:19.618]  They are waging war against any power structure that is virtuous and independent and strong.
[00:26:19.618 --> 00:26:27.080]  It's why they seek, and are always seeking, to destroy Christendom, to destroy the family, and to destroy the West.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:41.244]  Because once they've got that, they have no problem managing the third world, no problem managing slave factories in China, no problem managing the sweat shops in India, no problem managing the slaves in Mexico,
[00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:49.712]  That the Mexican government calls cockroaches and peons poor people.
[00:26:49.712 --> 00:26:50.732]  That's the elite there.
[00:26:50.732 --> 00:26:53.392]  They keep them poor on purpose.
[00:26:53.392 --> 00:27:01.094]  The American system is the tail end of the Renaissance where we believed we were going to make everybody successful and get rid of the slums and get rid of it.
[00:27:01.094 --> 00:27:08.536]  Malthus and others said set up the slums 350 years ago to keep them poor and keep them dumb.
[00:27:08.536 --> 00:27:10.036]  It's called policy!
[00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:16.492]  And how dare Trump want to get rid of that?
[00:27:16.492 --> 00:27:39.345]  But you know, once people are trained to only care about lottery tickets, and only care about their vape, or only care about whatever, once they're on the gravy train of watching the sitcoms and all the rest of the anti-family garbage where every male role model is an idiot, once that happens, once you've sabotaged the society, and once you've shipped the jobs overseas, and once you've not made it cool to work,
[00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:45.630]  You've broken the will and you've demoralized the people.
[00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:54.398]  And so, yes, we're beating the current world government system right now in this phase, but it's a pyrrhic victory.
[00:27:54.398 --> 00:28:01.383]  If we don't, it means, you know, we've won this war, but we end up really losing the culture.
[00:28:01.383 --> 00:28:05.567]  It's a war you win, but you end up kind of losing.
[00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:07.769]  If we don't get our moral house in order,
[00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:25.745]  And if we don't start honoring real feminine virtue and real male virtue, and if we don't start uplifting the idea of male resistance to tyranny, there will always be corrupt males that come in and enslave.
[00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:27.206]  And that's why they're removing the male.
[00:28:28.047 --> 00:28:40.810]  The super alpha males, whether it's a grizzly bear, or whether it's a lion, or whether it's a tiger, they go find the next alpha male coming up and kill them before they ever grow.
[00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.090]  They kill them while they're little.
[00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.691]  They kill them before they can ever get knee-high to a grasshopper.
[00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:50.672]  And it's exactly why they're targeting your boys.
[00:28:50.672 --> 00:28:52.812]  These people are maximum evil.
[00:28:52.812 --> 00:28:55.633]  They make Hitler look like a lightweight.
[00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:56.233]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.344 --> 00:29:02.286]  At WolfHillAmmo.com, we love shotguns.

[00:30:46.623 --> 00:30:59.389]  Head to infowarrestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:05.882]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:31:05.882 --> 00:31:15.627]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:31:15.627 --> 00:31:23.732]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:31:24.718 --> 00:31:32.640]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.741]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:37.242]  It really is amazing.
[00:31:37.242 --> 00:31:43.944]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:46.625]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:31:47.847 --> 00:31:50.269]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember
[00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:06.001]  This life is a test.
[00:32:06.001 --> 00:32:18.203]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing as being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[00:32:18.203 --> 00:32:28.205]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[00:32:28.205 --> 00:32:32.366]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[00:32:33.308 --> 00:32:36.970]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and who tend to see it.
[00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.631]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[00:32:39.631 --> 00:32:43.453]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[00:32:43.453 --> 00:32:44.274]  2018 has been insane.
[00:32:44.274 --> 00:32:51.618]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[00:32:51.618 --> 00:32:55.300]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.382]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[00:33:03.371 --> 00:33:18.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:28.907]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:33.132 --> 00:33:39.557]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:39.557 --> 00:33:44.220]  So we've seen some incredible developments in 2018.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:49.824]  2018 will fade into legend, into history.
[00:33:49.824 --> 00:33:55.348]  Coming up in about 12 hours on the East Coast.
[00:33:55.348 --> 00:33:59.531]  And we'll obviously be covering all the developments as things unfold this evening here at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:01.354 --> 00:34:03.196]  And newswars.com.
[00:34:03.196 --> 00:34:12.423]  But just finishing up what I was saying before I hit more news and take your calls.
[00:34:12.423 --> 00:34:17.087]  Any conquering army or culture kills the men.
[00:34:17.087 --> 00:34:18.348]  Down to about age 10 or 11, 12.
[00:34:18.348 --> 00:34:23.432]  And in some cultures, they would kill all the men, including baby boys.
[00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:33.130]  And any authoritarian regime always targets males in general and puts them into special cast to control them.
[00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:45.282]  Everybody knows that women in the sugar cane fields going back 500 years ago in the Caribbean and then starting about 300 years ago in the United States, what is the United States today,
[00:34:46.630 --> 00:35:00.484]  That black women were brought in the house and allowed to learn and read in some cases and put in charge of the black men who were kept like animals in straw.
[00:35:00.484 --> 00:35:03.588]  So when you see the attack on men
[00:35:04.952 --> 00:35:16.160]  And 65% of the college graduates being women, and the corporations all say they're going to put women in charge, and all the video games and all the movies, the men are idiots and the women are experts.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.623]  That has nothing to do with empowering women.
[00:35:19.623 --> 00:35:21.084]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:35:21.084 --> 00:35:27.128]  It's in the public documents that it is to destroy this culture.
[00:35:27.128 --> 00:35:32.492]  You give men sports, you get them to be arrested for development, they act like a bunch of juvenile delinquents.
[00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:36.867]  They grovel to the women.
[00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:40.189]  The women are not happy with that.
[00:35:40.189 --> 00:35:50.655]  And then they become bitter and basically join with the state because the state's promising them that if you just can be at war with men, you're going to have great success.
[00:35:50.655 --> 00:35:59.660]  Now, that's the model in the West that's been operative by the leftists that control the CIA since 1945 at the end of World War II.
[00:36:02.796 --> 00:36:11.261]  Or they wanted to have the state raise the children, and this is all declassified, and they wanted to have women working in the factories and paying taxes.
[00:36:11.261 --> 00:36:16.444]  That's how they sold the general government on it was, it's full mobilization for the Cold War.
[00:36:16.444 --> 00:36:18.285]  Well, okay, I guess we gotta do it.
[00:36:18.285 --> 00:36:21.747]  And again, I'm not against women that wanna be doctors or scientists or astronauts.
[00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:22.407]  That's great.
[00:36:22.407 --> 00:36:23.228]  I got three daughters.
[00:36:23.228 --> 00:36:25.189]  There's always been women in prominent positions.
[00:36:25.189 --> 00:36:29.191]  But the roles were then demonized and Ms.
[00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:30.112]  Magazine was given
[00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:40.460]  $20 million in early 1960s money to be run by Gloria Steinem.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.440]  This is declassified.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.641]  She works for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:46.062]  Now, she went off and got married and had a bunch of kids.
[00:36:46.062 --> 00:36:47.623]  She just taught other women don't do it.
[00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:58.599]  Oh, the elites have all got, like, you know, the men are total alpha males, the women behind closed doors are wearing dresses, totally in those roles, but when they march out to you, they're not.
[00:36:58.599 --> 00:37:05.885]  You have to understand, they relish hurting you, making sure you die alone, women and men.
[00:37:05.885 --> 00:37:08.588]  These are hyper-aggressive, hyper-evil people.
[00:37:10.526 --> 00:37:18.213]  And Gloria Steinem, how good it was to get an abortion, and how it's fun, and they have liberals on TV going, I got it, I love it, it's fun to kill your babies.
[00:37:18.213 --> 00:37:20.235]  Those are actual quotes.
[00:37:20.235 --> 00:37:24.479]  That woman get the abortion, you know, an actress on TV and say, oh it felt so good.
[00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:26.941]  She goes, oh yeah, it's like sexual pleasure.
[00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:27.862]  Remember that a few years ago?
[00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:36.248]  And then women are taught pouring Drano in their eyes and being blind is wonderful and the psychologist dumps the Drano in their eyes and they go, it's so beautiful.
[00:37:36.248 --> 00:37:38.890]  And the news goes, look, look, she identified as blind.
[00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.253]  She burned her eyeballs.
[00:37:41.253 --> 00:37:48.039]  Oh, by the way, if you're a new viewer, I'm not joking.
[00:37:48.039 --> 00:37:49.661]  I'm not joking.
[00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:50.662]  It's transabled.
[00:37:53.322 --> 00:38:02.707]  Now, used to, you wanted to gouge your eyeballs out or pour Drano on them, they stuck you in a called a rubber room.
[00:38:02.707 --> 00:38:13.192]  But now, oh, the national TV in the UK and the US all just go, oh my God, it's so beautiful!
[00:38:13.192 --> 00:38:17.234]  It's so beautiful how you dump Drano in your eyeballs.
[00:38:17.234 --> 00:38:19.875]  Oh my God, this is so wonderful.
[00:38:19.875 --> 00:38:21.176]  You've got so much courage.
[00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:23.611]  We're a radio listener.
[00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:27.895]  We're actually showing the video to people.
[00:38:27.895 --> 00:38:30.558]  And just how much she loved losing her sight.
[00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:31.199]  It was so good.
[00:38:31.199 --> 00:38:34.683]  I was talking to one of the producers.
[00:38:34.683 --> 00:38:36.024]  We probably need to get the audio.
[00:38:36.024 --> 00:38:42.471]  Guess what they've been playing on local public radio in Austin for Christmas music?
[00:38:44.264 --> 00:38:54.391]  It's crying babies and satanic murder sounds of demons going... Oh, you think I'm joking?
[00:38:54.391 --> 00:38:58.134]  I actually have the recording right here, here.
[00:38:58.134 --> 00:39:00.296]  Had to give this to the folks for the show.
[00:39:00.296 --> 00:39:02.938]  Pull this up for you.
[00:39:02.938 --> 00:39:11.324]  This is, uh... This is Christmas music, holiday music, here on so-called public radio.
[00:39:29.182 --> 00:39:44.714]  That's the music they play when they torture kids, by the way.
[00:39:44.714 --> 00:39:46.776]  Corrupt the child.
[00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:51.340]  Kill them all.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.963]  See, this is their revolution time.
[00:39:54.963 --> 00:39:56.584]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:02.193]  Oh, but see, China didn't do that model.
[00:40:02.193 --> 00:40:04.955]  They said no, and they worked with the West to do it.
[00:40:04.955 --> 00:40:06.556]  It was all in big agreements.
[00:40:06.556 --> 00:40:14.342]  They got Western funding to kill vast majority of little girls when they're born.
[00:40:14.342 --> 00:40:19.546]  So you get 50 million, that's the latest number, 50 million girls that were killed.
[00:40:19.546 --> 00:40:20.646]  Oh, but see how feminist that is?
[00:40:20.646 --> 00:40:27.552]  And like all the woman empowerment now, women, you know, out there, debasing themselves everywhere.
[00:40:28.675 --> 00:40:30.617]  Studies show women have never been more unhappy.
[00:40:30.617 --> 00:40:33.980]  But see, it's okay, because the globalists are doing it for you and your family.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.503]  But they're trying to get rid of.
[00:40:36.503 --> 00:40:39.205]  But see, there's a group not doing that.
[00:40:39.205 --> 00:40:42.689]  And who are they?
[00:40:42.689 --> 00:40:46.512]  It's the largest country in the world.
[00:40:46.512 --> 00:40:47.413]  And it's only 200 million people.
[00:40:50.382 --> 00:41:15.441]  And it's got its problems, but they're into men being men, and women being women, and they teach in Mainline College and Mainline High School, and on the national news, that the Western globalists are trying to destroy the family, and trying to overrun Europe with Islamists, and breaking down the borders, and they're trying to do it to Russia, and Russia said, we're not going to chemically lobotomize five-year-olds, and if anyone tries to teach a boy that he's really a girl,
[00:41:16.321 --> 00:41:19.604]  That's child endangerment and we're going to arrest your ass.
[00:41:19.604 --> 00:41:28.991]  Just like, used to, I guess in a park, if an adult walked over to somebody's kid and said to a little boy, you know, let's talk about your genitals and how we could cut them off.
[00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:30.933]  You'd say, oh my God, that's a pervert.
[00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:32.013]  Oh, not today.
[00:41:32.013 --> 00:41:33.975]  Oh, thank you.
[00:41:33.975 --> 00:41:37.538]  Well, the Russians have said, over our dead body.
[00:41:38.649 --> 00:41:42.331]  And the globalists said, if you let one country stand up, they might all stand up.
[00:41:42.331 --> 00:41:47.413]  And suddenly, from Brazil to the UK to the US, it's happening.
[00:41:47.413 --> 00:41:49.614]  And people are saying, we're done.
[00:41:49.614 --> 00:41:50.834]  They're reading the textbooks.
[00:41:50.834 --> 00:41:52.735]  They're reading what the globalists say.
[00:41:52.735 --> 00:41:59.978]  And man, when you go out and protest globalists, demonic, satanic meth heads show up that are professors.
[00:41:59.978 --> 00:42:01.318]  And they're literally on video.
[00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.259]  Shea.
[00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:04.860]  And they're not joking just to freak you out because they know you're a Christian.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.501]  They go, I love Satan.
[00:42:07.381 --> 00:42:09.522]  I've killed over 20 of my own children.
[00:42:09.522 --> 00:42:13.084]  We wait till the ninth trimester and dedicate it to Satan!
[00:42:13.084 --> 00:42:17.245]  I kill my children and I'm gonna kill you!
[00:42:17.245 --> 00:42:20.747]  And then there's just gonna be like 20 of them, the women on the line.
[00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:21.928]  And that's who they are!
[00:42:21.928 --> 00:42:24.649]  And your children, they believe belong to them!
[00:42:29.244 --> 00:42:31.205]  Now that's the Antifa vanguard.
[00:42:31.205 --> 00:42:40.890]  Then you've got the poor little boy that they have dancing, you know, at the gay bars, who talks about how he uses ketamine, and nobody gets in trouble for that.
[00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:49.594]  And then public school events where men come and shake their butts in front of little children, and they stick $5 bills in their G-strings.
[00:42:49.594 --> 00:42:55.177]  It's just the whole nambla train running America over.
[00:42:55.177 --> 00:42:57.799]  Your phone calls are coming up to Dan Lyman from the EU.
[00:42:59.175 --> 00:43:08.485]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:11.348]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.348 --> 00:43:17.394]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.055 --> 00:43:24.321]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:30.626]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:30.626 --> 00:43:37.552]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:38.693 --> 00:43:51.697]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:51.697 --> 00:43:55.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:55.958 --> 00:43:59.399]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:43:59.399 --> 00:44:02.479]  Our grandparents, great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:44:02.479 --> 00:44:04.020]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.408 --> 00:44:08.350]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:12.412]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.

[00:44:45.468 --> 00:44:48.009]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.009 --> 00:44:52.992]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:52.992 --> 00:44:58.375]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:00.188 --> 00:45:05.689]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:45:05.689 --> 00:45:15.451]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:23.553]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:45:24.534 --> 00:45:32.460]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.583]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.064]  It really is amazing.
[00:45:37.064 --> 00:45:43.770]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.452]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:45:47.757 --> 00:45:52.221]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[00:45:52.221 --> 00:45:53.623]  That's the globalist only hope.
[00:46:07.196 --> 00:46:26.661]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[00:46:26.661 --> 00:46:32.402]  When you order products at InfoWarsStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[00:46:32.902 --> 00:46:38.565]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[00:46:38.565 --> 00:46:41.047]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[00:46:41.047 --> 00:46:42.187]  Every order gets free shipping.
[00:46:42.187 --> 00:46:54.294]  Every order gets 50 to 75 percent off in total clearance and that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight but to expand.
[00:46:54.294 --> 00:46:55.014]  We're on the march.
[00:46:55.014 --> 00:46:56.275]  The empire's on the run.
[00:46:56.275 --> 00:46:57.236]  I salute you all.
[00:46:57.236 --> 00:46:59.097]  Now please take action at m4store.com.
[00:47:03.274 --> 00:47:05.958]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:24.953]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:47:24.953 --> 00:47:26.634]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:26.634 --> 00:47:28.416]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:28.416 --> 00:47:34.541]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:40.806]  By the way, remember the amazing Desmond that they teach school kids about all over the country, who's from New York?
[00:47:42.919 --> 00:47:47.183]  Who, since he was like eight years old, has been on national TV as a trans kid.
[00:47:47.183 --> 00:47:54.509]  He dances at gay strip bars and the police don't come because it's liberal, so it's okay.
[00:47:54.509 --> 00:48:01.716]  He talked about LGBTP, you know, the pedophilia, and about taking ketamine in a video we played two weeks ago.
[00:48:02.898 --> 00:48:14.724]  Coming up next hour, another video that we just found of him with adult gay men looking completely drugged out of his mind with signs behind him talking about taking roofies.
[00:48:14.724 --> 00:48:15.805]  That's the date rape drug.
[00:48:15.805 --> 00:48:19.247]  I mean, this poor child.
[00:48:19.247 --> 00:48:21.228]  This needs to be investigated immediately.
[00:48:23.973 --> 00:48:25.174]  So we'll get to that next hour.
[00:48:25.174 --> 00:48:27.235]  I want to start going to your calls.
[00:48:27.235 --> 00:48:30.977]  Then at about 20 after, Dan Lyman is going to join us for a couple of segments.
[00:48:30.977 --> 00:48:39.363]  Our EuropeWars.com reporter doing a great job over there on how they're fighting back against the globalists.
[00:48:39.363 --> 00:48:42.405]  They're taking down EU flags all over Europe.
[00:48:42.405 --> 00:48:43.826]  They're storming parliaments.
[00:48:43.826 --> 00:48:45.026]  They're storming capitals.
[00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:48.869]  They're storming elite vacation islands that Macron's on.
[00:48:50.575 --> 00:48:53.257]  Top generals are saying he should be arrested for treason.
[00:48:53.257 --> 00:48:55.099]  It's on.
[00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:59.002]  Like Donkey Kong, as they say.
[00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:06.107]  So we're on the march, the globalists are on the run, and they admit that 2018's biggest losers was the New World Order.
[00:49:06.107 --> 00:49:09.610]  The global liberal order.
[00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:12.192]  That's gonna teach your kids how to have sex when they're three years old.
[00:49:14.104 --> 00:49:24.171]  These people are going for broke, but they're striking back with total censorship and intimidation against those of us that are in the anti-globalist leadership.
[00:49:24.171 --> 00:49:29.074]  That's why I cannot stress enough how we need your prayers first and foremost, and we need your support.
[00:49:29.074 --> 00:49:36.819]  And by the way, I got this news right before the broadcast started, but I wanted to get more details, and I do have more details now.
[00:49:36.819 --> 00:49:38.080]  David Knight suffered
[00:49:41.835 --> 00:49:45.458]  Saturday night, a pretty serious heart attack.
[00:49:45.458 --> 00:49:48.601]  And he had several procedures done today at 5 a.m.
[00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:53.865]  And he got out of surgery and then came out and was stabilized by about 1030.
[00:49:53.865 --> 00:49:57.048]  And we had a chance to talk to the family right before I went on air.
[00:49:57.048 --> 00:49:58.629]  I've talked to him more now.
[00:49:58.629 --> 00:50:01.472]  And the host of the David Knight Show, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:50:01.472 --> 00:50:03.313]  He's worked with InfoWars for almost eight years.
[00:50:03.313 --> 00:50:05.595]  He's a treasure.
[00:50:05.595 --> 00:50:07.357]  Super smart, engineer, patriot.
[00:50:09.745 --> 00:50:15.467]  And, uh, we hope he gets back in the saddle as soon as possible.
[00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:19.928]  But, uh, that is certainly, uh, prayers are answered there.
[00:50:19.928 --> 00:50:22.228]  He's not completely out of the woods, but he's partway out of the woods.
[00:50:22.228 --> 00:50:24.889]  So that is certainly a great news to everybody.
[00:50:24.889 --> 00:50:26.610]  Thank you for your prayers for David Knight.
[00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:27.750]  Really, really appreciate that.
[00:50:31.738 --> 00:50:36.259]  I know Owen hosted his show this morning, and I think we're going to have a roundtable of hosts until David's back.
[00:50:36.259 --> 00:50:38.900]  I know David's going to want to come back, obviously.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:51.743]  I'm going to make him take off some serious, serious time, because it's just something that's got to be done.
[00:50:51.743 --> 00:50:58.765]  Now, I want to hit the border a little bit, and then go to break and come back with your calls.
[00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:28.656]  The global crime cartel is using culture war to break down society, de-industrialization to destroy independence, computerization and automation with robots, not to empower humanity, but to remove us from the decision-making process so the globalists have full technocratic, technotronic, technocracy power.
[00:51:28.656 --> 00:51:30.096]  And their own admissions.
[00:51:30.096 --> 00:51:34.438]  So they're building a world where we're obsolete and where they can dictate total control over us.
[00:51:36.328 --> 00:51:39.169]  It's a breakaway civilization move.
[00:51:39.169 --> 00:52:00.676]  The other spear on the fork of deindustrialization and of balkanization, divide and conquer, is flooding the nation states with the lowest IQ, most criminal, stupidest people from the third world.
[00:52:00.676 --> 00:52:01.996]  Not the good people from the third world.
[00:52:03.203 --> 00:52:05.745]  And then weaponizing them politically once they get here.
[00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:08.948]  And everyone knows that.
[00:52:08.948 --> 00:52:11.471]  Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world.
[00:52:11.471 --> 00:52:14.614]  200,000 people killed the last decade.
[00:52:14.614 --> 00:52:16.596]  Hundreds of thousands missing.
[00:52:16.596 --> 00:52:26.966]  And so we have serious Mexican mafia, MS-13, people that don't care about getting killed, pouring in, human smuggling children.
[00:52:26.966 --> 00:52:28.247]  Even the Washington Post had to admit that.
[00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:36.658]  And so now, you have this illegal alien who shoots this police officer, who happened to be Hispanic.
[00:52:36.658 --> 00:52:41.443]  And so the left's having a problem, because when a white cop gets killed, they literally in the news say he deserves it.
[00:52:41.443 --> 00:52:47.470]  Where a white woman gets shot in the back by an illegal alien, the media says it's okay, and the jury lets the guy go.
[00:52:49.346 --> 00:52:58.790]  But because this is a good-looking Hispanic cop with a good record that got killed, it's a poster child for how half the country is going to be Hispanic in just a decade.
[00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:59.811]  In most areas it already is.
[00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:00.831]  It's your country.
[00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:05.894]  So trying to make it a race war or bring in the worst criminals in Mexico, that's mainly going to kill Hispanic people.
[00:53:05.894 --> 00:53:07.754]  And Hispanic folks know that.
[00:53:07.754 --> 00:53:10.396]  But the controlled media tries to say it's all racial.
[00:53:10.396 --> 00:53:12.917]  No, we don't want the worst people out of Mexico.
[00:53:14.144 --> 00:53:26.833]  And almost every time I hear about a cop getting shot at or killed, a week later they released the dash cam footage and it's some crazy MS-13 dude just cop pulls you over try to kill him.
[00:53:26.833 --> 00:53:37.541]  And so you watch the sheriff there in California in this county breaking down and crying from Friday and we aired it over the weekend but I want to go ahead and play this because remember Nancy Pelosi said MS-13 are good people.
[00:53:39.975 --> 00:53:41.635]  We're all God's children.
[00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:46.776]  That's because in many areas the Democrats are using them as hitmen.
[00:53:46.776 --> 00:53:54.438]  Now, I've been told this by the FBI, by the CIA, by the Department of Defense, five years ago, that Obama was using them.
[00:53:54.438 --> 00:53:58.758]  Now it's come out in the news that Democrats locally are using them as their muscle.
[00:53:58.758 --> 00:54:05.059]  Because you can just say to a lawyer, an immigration lawyer, oh, this person needs to be dealt with.
[00:54:05.059 --> 00:54:07.700]  And then, MS-13 gets a message from one of their leaders,
[00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:11.799]  Or one of the other mafia groups, and they kill you!
[00:54:11.799 --> 00:54:18.481]  Just like Mexico, or Nicaragua, or El Salvador, or Guatemala.
[00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:24.763]  So, MS-13 and these different Latin gangs are the muscle of the Democratic Party.
[00:54:24.763 --> 00:54:29.144]  And now they're using Chinese gangs as the muscle against Asians.
[00:54:29.144 --> 00:54:32.145]  The Democrats are a criminal group, man!
[00:54:32.145 --> 00:54:33.946]  James O'Keefe can't walk in any.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.781]  Democrat office and say, I'm running sex slaves.
[00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:40.901]  Good, we'll help you.
[00:54:40.901 --> 00:54:41.881]  I'm going to steal votes.
[00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:43.321]  Good, we're going to help you.
[00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:47.882]  Combino O'Rourke's campaign, how they're bringing in smuggled caravan people.
[00:54:47.882 --> 00:54:49.583]  This is what they do.
[00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:50.703]  That's who they are.
[00:54:50.703 --> 00:54:54.444]  They're the mafia.
[00:54:54.444 --> 00:54:56.524]  And they want to break this country completely.
[00:54:56.524 --> 00:55:00.125]  So here's a piece from Fox earlier with the sheriff talking about what really happened.
[00:55:02.056 --> 00:55:03.617]  Of course it's being politicized.
[00:55:03.617 --> 00:55:06.280]  The last thing in the world I want to do is politicize the death of Officer Singh.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.841]  But let's go back to Ron.
[00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:08.221]  An immigrant.
[00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:11.324]  Immigrated here lawfully and legally to pursue his American dream.
[00:55:11.324 --> 00:55:13.386]  He achieved that goal.
[00:55:32.253 --> 00:55:35.375]  And his dream was taken from him.
[00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:44.902]  No, we shouldn't politicize it, but we have to have a conversation about restrictive legislation that puts our communities at risk.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:55.724]  California Governor Jerry Brown's spokesman issuing a statement saying, quote, California law fully permits the sharing of information on dangerous gang members.
[00:55:55.724 --> 00:55:57.385]  Oh, stop right there.
[00:55:57.385 --> 00:55:58.685]  No, they don't.
[00:55:58.685 --> 00:56:02.147]  And neither do the mayors of places like Oakland and San Francisco.
[00:56:02.147 --> 00:56:07.069]  They tell the MS-13 Dens when ICE is coming.
[00:56:08.288 --> 00:56:17.632]  To the point where federal law enforcement can't even tell these cities and counties that are sanctuary cities, over 900 of them, that they're coming, or there'll be people waiting to shoot them.
[00:56:17.632 --> 00:56:23.554]  The answer is cutting all federal funds off from sanctuary cities, period.
[00:56:23.554 --> 00:56:30.316]  The answer is cutting USAID funding completely for refugee programs, because these are not refugee programs.
[00:56:30.316 --> 00:56:34.598]  These have been weaponized against our nations in an admitted globalist plan.
[00:56:36.923 --> 00:56:38.945]  They are a pack of criminals.
[00:56:38.945 --> 00:56:40.707]  And I'm not talking about the illegal aliens.
[00:56:40.707 --> 00:56:45.473]  Most of the people trying to get here illegally are just desperately poor fleeing the hell they were in.
[00:56:45.473 --> 00:56:49.518]  But they're bringing it with them, folks, and diseases and everything else.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.940]  By the way, this is the last day.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.502]  It may extend until tomorrow, but we're almost sold out of everything.
[00:56:56.502 --> 00:56:59.222]  X2, we're almost sold out of the original X2.
[00:56:59.222 --> 00:57:01.463]  We're almost sold out of Brain Force Plus.
[00:57:01.463 --> 00:57:04.324]  We're almost sold out of Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:57:04.324 --> 00:57:06.825]  We're almost sold out of Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:57:06.825 --> 00:57:10.526]  We're almost sold out of more than 30 best-selling items.
[00:57:10.526 --> 00:57:13.066]  All the t-shirts in extra large and large are sold out.
[00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:15.587]  We had to stop the free t-shirt deal, now it's a free gift.
[00:57:15.587 --> 00:57:16.968]  Storewide free shipping, 50 to 75% off.
[00:57:18.509 --> 00:57:22.004]  Double Patriot points on your next order and a free gift with every order.
[00:57:23.686 --> 00:57:27.888]  Total clearance by the end of the year is we don't have to pay inventory tax.

[00:58:43.514 --> 00:58:44.234]  We're on the march.
[00:58:44.234 --> 00:58:45.496]  The empire's on the run.
[00:58:45.496 --> 00:58:46.457]  I salute you all.

[00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:53.173]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:58:53.173 --> 00:58:59.480]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.262]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[00:59:01.262 --> 00:59:07.829]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:14.271]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.
[00:59:14.271 --> 00:59:20.373]  With our powerhouse formula, Happies can be an important part of your daily supplement routine.
[00:59:20.373 --> 00:59:28.176]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life, it's more important than ever to support your body in the fight against stress.
[00:59:28.676 --> 00:59:30.917]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:11.540]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:17.282 --> 01:00:23.304]  Okay, thank you so much for joining us on the final global transmission of the Alex Jones Show for 2018.
[01:00:23.304 --> 01:00:31.906]  I'm gonna go to your calls for the next three segments, and then Dan Lyman's gonna be joining me, our EuropeWars.com main correspondent.
[01:00:31.906 --> 01:00:33.967]  He's got a few other guys he works with over there.
[01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:36.728]  Covers Davos, covers the Yellow Vest, just big developments.
[01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:42.812]  On that front, coming up, and a lot of other news, obviously haven't gotten into yet.
[01:00:42.812 --> 01:00:44.673]  They're accelerating their censorship.
[01:00:44.673 --> 01:00:47.035]  Now against Franklin Graham.
[01:00:47.035 --> 01:00:51.218]  Pocahontas, the fraud, has announced what she's going to be doing.
[01:00:51.218 --> 01:00:52.659]  This is all scripted by the Democrats.
[01:00:52.659 --> 01:00:54.040]  I'll break that down.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.622]  There is so much more we're going to be getting to.
[01:00:56.622 --> 01:01:00.044]  But a lot of positive things happened this year as well I'm going to be talking about.
[01:01:00.044 --> 01:01:04.968]  Obviously two good Supreme Court justices compared to what Hillary would do.
[01:01:04.968 --> 01:01:06.289]  Excellent compared to what she would have done.
[01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:15.271]  Now they're freaking out over Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation in the Senate, because Trump has an even stronger hand there now.
[01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:23.413]  But they're warming up with 84 investigations that Democrats have announced when they go back into Congress in three days that they're going to be launching.
[01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:27.614]  It is going to be crazy town.
[01:01:27.614 --> 01:01:32.135]  And I've got Michael Moore coming up saying he can't wait to see the Trumps in orange jumpsuits.
[01:01:32.135 --> 01:01:35.136]  Oh, but of course, not for any Russiagate.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.223]  But for claiming that they knew Michael Cohen was doing something wrong?
[01:01:42.223 --> 01:01:44.265]  I mean, there's nothing there.
[01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:50.389]  But they're busting every lawyer that Trump uses in different cities for things those lawyers have done.
[01:01:50.389 --> 01:01:53.911]  So the lawyers then turn state's evidence against Trump and make something up.
[01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:55.993]  It's very elementary.
[01:01:55.993 --> 01:02:01.276]  The old-fashioned process of, we're gonna bust you unless you're an informant on this person.
[01:02:01.276 --> 01:02:03.938]  And by the way, you better find something.
[01:02:03.938 --> 01:02:05.479]  Because San Quentin's not a good place to be.
[01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.632]  And then you've got Mueller destroying evidence.
[01:02:09.632 --> 01:02:11.632]  These people are criminals.
[01:02:11.632 --> 01:02:18.054]  And everyone just shakes in their boots out of all these sick events that have basically destroyed our culture and our society.
[01:02:18.054 --> 01:02:21.255]  Somebody's got to stand up to these people.
[01:02:21.255 --> 01:02:26.097]  I know as a death-defying life I lead, I take my chances.
[01:02:26.097 --> 01:02:30.558]  But I don't do it to make my money and be on TV like the Fall guy, Lee Majors.
[01:02:30.558 --> 01:02:34.479]  I liked that show when I was a kid.
[01:02:34.479 --> 01:02:36.500]  I do it so my children will have a future.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:43.682]  Though we should probably come in with the Fall Guy next segment.
[01:02:43.682 --> 01:02:48.624]  If we can do that.
[01:02:48.624 --> 01:02:52.045]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the first call here.
[01:02:52.045 --> 01:02:53.786]  Let's go to Wild Man in Illinois.
[01:02:53.786 --> 01:02:56.147]  Thanks for holding and about to say Happy New Year.
[01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:59.028]  Go ahead.
[01:02:59.028 --> 01:02:59.888]  Alex.
[01:02:59.888 --> 01:03:01.449]  Welcome.
[01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:01.689]  Yeah.
[01:03:02.316 --> 01:03:13.786]  Going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[01:03:13.786 --> 01:03:15.188]  That's how he saves America.
[01:03:15.188 --> 01:03:19.672]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[01:03:20.151 --> 01:03:20.571]  I agree.
[01:03:20.571 --> 01:03:21.351]  Victory or death.
[01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:23.352]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[01:03:23.352 --> 01:03:25.412]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[01:03:25.412 --> 01:03:28.313]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[01:03:28.313 --> 01:03:30.793]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:32.393]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:32.954]  It's already begun.
[01:03:32.954 --> 01:03:35.514]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[01:03:35.514 --> 01:03:41.215]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:44.736]  So just get ready.
[01:03:44.736 --> 01:03:45.176]  I'm safe.
[01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:49.500]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.006]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:53.475]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[01:03:53.475 --> 01:03:54.856]  I want to thank you.
[01:03:54.856 --> 01:04:02.838]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:05.579]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:04:05.579 --> 01:04:06.699]  They're taking everybody.
[01:04:06.699 --> 01:04:09.520]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.680]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.121]  That's why this is a war.
[01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:16.862]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[01:04:16.862 --> 01:04:18.102]  Which products do you like the best?
[01:04:19.266 --> 01:04:23.308]  Man, I use the bodies, I got so many t-shirts, it ain't even funny.
[01:04:23.308 --> 01:04:28.350]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:32.212]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[01:04:32.212 --> 01:04:33.553]  I spread the word about you.
[01:04:33.553 --> 01:04:37.455]  I wear your clothes, your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[01:04:37.455 --> 01:04:40.616]  I've a multitude of products.
[01:04:40.616 --> 01:04:44.018]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:53.986]  Um, you know, it's, uh, people's skeptical, but, like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[01:04:53.986 --> 01:04:57.408]  I just, it's just so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[01:04:57.408 --> 01:04:58.569]  God bless you.
[01:04:58.569 --> 01:05:03.411]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:12.276]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:17.657]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:06:10.785 --> 01:06:15.189]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:15.189 --> 01:06:16.791]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.791 --> 01:06:26.820]  So, we're taking phone calls on what you think of 2018 and what you think is coming up 2019.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.702]  First call we took, made a great point.
[01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:44.398]  Trump has to get on the offense and go after the whole criminal deep state, the illegal FISA warrant, the illegal investigation of him, the perjury to Congress by Mueller and by Comey, caught red-handed, the destruction of evidence by Mueller.
[01:06:44.398 --> 01:06:45.759]  They have to go on the offense.
[01:06:45.759 --> 01:06:50.642]  And you hear Giuliani saying that now, that means they're getting ready to do it.
[01:06:50.642 --> 01:06:53.684]  Which means the deep state's going to be very, very dangerous right now.
[01:06:53.684 --> 01:06:56.846]  China says they're getting ready to make a deal with Trump so the stock market's up.
[01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.008]  Democrats have 84 investigations.
[01:07:00.008 --> 01:07:04.029]  They're getting ready to launch in three days, when they take control of the House.
[01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:11.011]  Pocahontas with, wow, 0.000007% Native American.
[01:07:11.011 --> 01:07:16.693]  She's, they say, one of the whitest people in the world.
[01:07:16.693 --> 01:07:19.674]  She is running.
[01:07:19.674 --> 01:07:26.316]  And it's all how she's going to fight them big bankers and the New World Order, you know, the globalists, when every one of her policies is what they want.
[01:07:27.734 --> 01:07:28.455]  So that's amazing.
[01:07:28.455 --> 01:07:30.596]  But Bernie will play the part of the communist.
[01:07:30.596 --> 01:07:36.280]  She'll play the part of the moderate and pull the Democrats even further to the left.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.202]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:07:38.202 --> 01:07:41.924]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:46.528]  Let's go back to your phone calls and let's talk to Kyle in Arizona.
[01:07:46.528 --> 01:07:48.950]  Kyle, welcome and thanks for calling.
[01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:50.211]  Hey, how you doing brother?
[01:07:50.211 --> 01:07:50.711]  Good, my friend.
[01:07:52.048 --> 01:07:59.614]  Hey, yeah, just a new listener, my wife's an Advent listener, and it's amazing here in 2018, the censorship.
[01:07:59.614 --> 01:08:04.658]  I'm a Christian trying to spread the Word of God, and I can just see how they're trying to get rid of Christians, and it's really scary.
[01:08:05.814 --> 01:08:12.518]  Well, sir, I mean, anyone with American flags, anyone promoting even mainline churches is getting banned on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:08:12.518 --> 01:08:13.539]  I've talked about it.
[01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:24.607]  Now Franklin Graham was was removed by one of the, quote, fact checkers for dehumanization for defending the family from a two-year-old post.
[01:08:25.347 --> 01:08:25.647]  Wow, I know.
[01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:26.288]  It's incredible.
[01:08:51.363 --> 01:09:14.418]  It's scary at the same time, you know, just hearing it and seeing the censorship, like you said, with Graham and everything, and it's really scary as I start to watch and listen and look into everything on Infowars and how true it is, and they end up trying to block you out and everything, and just definitely praying for you and praying for everyone, including David Knight, because it's scary how they're trying to shut everything down.
[01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:17.260]  Well, Michael Savage is in a contract, so he can't talk about it.
[01:09:18.442 --> 01:09:32.209]  But he has the number one show in the country in his slot, and they're taking a show from three hours to one hour and giving it to a guy that's never been in talk radio and has no ratings, Mr. Shapiro, and it's all because he's pro-Trump.
[01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:36.651]  And everyone's getting told, you become anti-Trump or you're going to be off the air.
[01:09:36.651 --> 01:09:43.395]  And the only people that are not going along with this are myself, Matt Drudge, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson,
[01:09:44.431 --> 01:09:48.612]  But I can tell you from behind the scenes things I know about people at Fox.
[01:09:48.612 --> 01:09:50.773]  I wasn't given this by Tucker or by anybody else.
[01:09:50.773 --> 01:09:52.914]  I got people that were in the room, though.
[01:09:52.914 --> 01:09:58.275]  They've all been threatened with being fired and stuff if they don't start becoming anti-Trump.
[01:09:58.275 --> 01:10:02.757]  And so when Fox News is doing that, you know we're two minutes to midnight.
[01:10:02.757 --> 01:10:05.518]  That's why they want to remove everybody off of social media.
[01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:10.960]  So that things can't spread virally before they make their move on Trump.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.121]  God bless you, Kyle.
[01:10:12.121 --> 01:10:13.422]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:15.103]  Trump must take action.
[01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:18.945]  We must all take action against the censors.
[01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:20.305]  It's outrageous.
[01:10:20.305 --> 01:10:31.671]  And again, first they demonized me for two years, lying about who I was, so that when they banned me, it would sound legitimate and people wouldn't say it was wrong.
[01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:33.232]  When the majority didn't say it was wrong,
[01:10:34.383 --> 01:10:37.645]  First they came for Alex Jones, then they came for Franklin Graham.
[01:10:37.645 --> 01:10:40.426]  They're coming for everyone.
[01:10:40.426 --> 01:10:44.449]  And almost no one works for themselves.
[01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:51.813]  Almost no one except Matt Drudge and myself have their own platform, their own syndication, their own system.
[01:10:51.813 --> 01:10:54.114]  No one else is truly independent.
[01:10:54.114 --> 01:10:59.037]  They're good people, Sean Hannity and others, but they can be taken off by their syndicator or by Fox.
[01:11:01.363 --> 01:11:06.806]  That's why Michael Savage is being taken on, because he is in a syndicator.
[01:11:06.806 --> 01:11:10.107]  So, it's on.
[01:11:10.107 --> 01:11:19.432]  And they have brigades of corporate fake media, CNN, working behind the scenes with the Democratic Party and the government and corporations to take people off the air.
[01:11:19.432 --> 01:11:22.073]  This is a concerted takeover in the U.S.
[01:11:22.073 --> 01:11:23.814]  We're in a war.
[01:11:23.814 --> 01:11:25.255]  And they do two things to me, and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:11:26.826 --> 01:11:29.327]  They just keep saying, Jones admits he's an actor.
[01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.487]  Jones admits he's fake.
[01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.108]  Did you hear?
[01:11:31.108 --> 01:11:34.049]  Jones said he didn't believe any of it.
[01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:35.850]  There's never a tape.
[01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:37.850]  There's never a video.
[01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:40.552]  They just say it on every channel, every day.
[01:11:40.552 --> 01:11:42.432]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:48.095]  People walk up to me and they go, oh, so you admit you're a fake, you piece of crap?
[01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:56.098]  Oh yeah, I'm real fake being demonized and attacked everywhere and telling you Trump would win and we'd fight back against world government and, you know, there's giant pedophile rings running everything and it's all, no.
[01:11:57.168 --> 01:12:01.692]  I'm over the target and I'm not like even happy about that.
[01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:02.833]  I'm like, oh, I'm over the target.
[01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:04.454]  I'm the tough guy that's willing to do this.
[01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:13.842]  I'm freaked out that most men I know only care about their Porsche or playing golf and how much sex they can have.
[01:12:13.842 --> 01:12:19.187]  And a lot of them are stronger than I am, better looking than I am, but they don't have any spirit.
[01:12:19.187 --> 01:12:20.388]  And it's like, what is the point?
[01:12:20.388 --> 01:12:21.609]  Why are you even having children?
[01:12:22.995 --> 01:12:27.817]  But they love to go to galas and stand out and everyone admire them.
[01:12:27.817 --> 01:12:32.019]  They're not real people.
[01:12:32.019 --> 01:12:36.100]  They're not real people.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:39.582]  And they're going to lose everything.
[01:12:39.582 --> 01:12:43.143]  All the trendies, all the yuppies, all of you.
[01:12:43.143 --> 01:12:44.224]  No, not Joe Rogan.
[01:12:44.224 --> 01:12:46.665]  He's, you know, Joe's an entertainer.
[01:12:46.665 --> 01:12:52.067]  And Joe, you know, blue collar guy from Boston, you know,
[01:12:54.184 --> 01:12:58.966]  He's successful, is successful, and Joe's a good guy.
[01:12:58.966 --> 01:13:02.367]  He's chosen his road, I've chosen mine.
[01:13:02.367 --> 01:13:03.707]  I'm proud to be on my road.
[01:13:03.707 --> 01:13:06.708]  Not compromising, not backing down.
[01:13:06.708 --> 01:13:07.948]  The crew put Joe on screen.
[01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:10.149]  Since you bring up Joe, here's one thing I'm going to say about it.
[01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:12.790]  I ought to make a statement to him at some point.
[01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:21.653]  I've talked to him, and I've left him messages, and we've talked back and forth on text, and I've talked to him on the phone, and I just said, just stop shaying.
[01:13:23.267 --> 01:13:29.369]  The Soros line that I won't stop harassing Sandy Hook parents or going to their houses or that I say nobody died.
[01:13:29.369 --> 01:13:33.570]  Because for years I haven't said that and I never sent anybody to their houses.
[01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:39.372]  And it's the thing the media puts out there out of everything I've done to make me sound like I'm a bad guy.
[01:13:39.372 --> 01:13:41.673]  So if you're not going to have me on, that's fine.
[01:13:41.673 --> 01:13:43.033]  Just stop saying
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.220]  The talking points.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:45.720]  But he won't.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.742]  It's George Soros is a hero of World War II, fought the Nazis, barely survived.
[01:13:49.742 --> 01:13:51.342]  He's a war hero.
[01:13:51.342 --> 01:13:57.684]  Alex Jones won't stop being mean to Sandy Hook parents.
[01:13:57.684 --> 01:13:59.805]  You know, and it's just like, wow.
[01:13:59.805 --> 01:14:07.588]  So you're not just not going to have me on, so I can defend myself to a larger platform of liberals, but you're going to then
[01:14:08.917 --> 01:14:12.301]  Keep putting out the lie, because it's the same line over and over again.
[01:14:12.301 --> 01:14:17.006]  He sent a guy with a gun to a pizza place to kill people, because pedophilia doesn't exist.
[01:14:17.006 --> 01:14:18.748]  That's the cover story for all that.
[01:14:18.748 --> 01:14:25.495]  And he blah blah blah is being mean to the Sandy Hook parents and sending people to their houses.
[01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:26.176]  None of that's true.
[01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:37.887]  I mean, Megyn Kelly, before she left Fox, aired audio of video where I said Hillary's responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of women and children in the Arab Spring she funded.
[01:14:37.887 --> 01:14:43.609]  They edited it and said that I said Hillary was doing that in a pizza place.
[01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:46.271]  Now, I should have sued Fox and Megyn Kelly at that time.
[01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:53.974]  And the statute of limitations is up, but I think we can transfer it forward, and we're looking at doing it, but I just get so busy I haven't yet.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:00.182]  I can't even get on any big platform other than mine to show that.
[01:15:00.182 --> 01:15:07.585]  In fact, they took my YouTube down with billions of views where I showed the original video of what I said versus what she did.
[01:15:07.585 --> 01:15:08.865]  So see, that's the thing.
[01:15:08.865 --> 01:15:12.147]  That's what sucks is being partially tied up.
[01:15:12.147 --> 01:15:14.488]  And like, hey, Joe, I've known you for 18, 19 years.
[01:15:14.488 --> 01:15:15.488]  You know, we were buddies.
[01:15:15.488 --> 01:15:16.969]  We partied together.
[01:15:16.969 --> 01:15:21.730]  Can you help me just at least say, at least say I didn't say this.
[01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.191]  Joe's like, no, man, I ain't saying it.
[01:15:23.191 --> 01:15:25.112]  In fact, I'm going to say they're talking point.
[01:15:26.092 --> 01:15:27.593]  I'm going to shoot another arrow in your gut.
[01:15:27.593 --> 01:15:28.774]  So that's fine.
[01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.895]  I say, I like it!
[01:15:30.895 --> 01:15:42.562]  Because I'm an American, and I'm not backing down, and I'm not scared, and I'm not selling out for not 30 pieces, or 300 pieces, or 33 trillion pieces of silver.
[01:15:42.562 --> 01:15:47.005]  I'm not afraid of losing everything, including my life, for the truth!
[01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:48.906]  I'm double down!
[01:15:48.906 --> 01:15:50.647]  I'm the real deal!
[01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:52.388]  I'm not a fake tough guy!
[01:15:52.388 --> 01:15:54.870]  I'm just a man standing up for my family!

[01:17:58.348 --> 01:18:02.268]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:18:03.624 --> 01:18:12.307]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:18:12.307 --> 01:18:14.268]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:18:14.268 --> 01:18:17.729]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:18:17.729 --> 01:18:20.350]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:22.651]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:18:22.651 --> 01:18:29.594]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:18:30.134 --> 01:18:35.049]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com
[01:18:36.232 --> 01:18:39.935]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:18:39.935 --> 01:18:41.116]  We'll win.
[01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:44.018]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:18:44.018 --> 01:18:51.183]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:18:51.183 --> 01:18:54.865]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[01:18:54.865 --> 01:18:56.426]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:18:56.426 --> 01:18:57.287]  We need your support.
[01:18:57.287 --> 01:18:58.027]  I'm counting on you.
[01:18:58.027 --> 01:18:59.709]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[01:19:02.082 --> 01:19:03.782]  This life is a test.
[01:19:03.782 --> 01:19:16.005]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing us being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[01:19:16.005 --> 01:19:25.987]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:19:25.987 --> 01:19:30.148]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[01:19:31.089 --> 01:19:34.751]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and you tend to see it.
[01:19:34.751 --> 01:19:37.412]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:19:37.412 --> 01:19:41.234]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:19:41.234 --> 01:19:42.514]  2018 has been insane.
[01:19:42.514 --> 01:19:49.397]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:19:49.397 --> 01:19:53.079]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:19:53.079 --> 01:19:57.181]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[01:20:01.832 --> 01:20:17.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:17.325 --> 01:20:22.410]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:24.381 --> 01:20:36.407]  I was not talking about Joe Rogan earlier when the guys flashed him up on screen but they do that as a joke to see if I'd go off on him and I'm not even mad at Joe.
[01:20:36.407 --> 01:20:36.727]  I am mad
[01:20:54.835 --> 01:21:00.156]  At Michael Savage being taken off the air with top ratings and being replaced with a neocon.
[01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:07.438]  I am mad at the total takeover and firing of Gavin McGinnis, who was number one on CRTV.
[01:21:07.438 --> 01:21:10.519]  And every day, and now Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:21:10.519 --> 01:21:15.580]  They're coming for everyone's speech, it's criminal.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:21.642]  And then to see Joe and others, to protect themselves, go with the talking points against me,
[01:21:25.118 --> 01:21:30.500]  Once they've gotten everybody else off the air, they're going to make Joe sing to whatever sheet of music they want as well.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.342]  They already basically do.
[01:21:33.342 --> 01:21:34.882]  And so it's not like I'm even mad.
[01:21:34.882 --> 01:21:37.724]  It's like losing somebody.
[01:21:37.724 --> 01:21:38.944]  It's like somebody died.
[01:21:38.944 --> 01:21:46.187]  I mean, Howard Stern, the king of free speech.
[01:21:46.187 --> 01:21:49.989]  And then he does the talking points and says, yeah, Alex Jones has got to be taken off the air.
[01:21:51.385 --> 01:21:54.927]  He says, you know, nobody doubted Sandy Hook and he's harassing the parents, which isn't true.
[01:21:54.927 --> 01:21:56.468]  I'm not harassing the parents.
[01:21:56.468 --> 01:21:57.488]  None of that's true.
[01:21:57.488 --> 01:21:59.369]  The Internet didn't buy some of it.
[01:21:59.369 --> 01:22:08.014]  We have a right to question things with babies and incubators that didn't die to launch the Iraq War and wag the dog scenarios and all the rest of it.
[01:22:08.014 --> 01:22:12.636]  I mean, you see stuff in the news all the time where they catch groups and organizations staging things.
[01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:13.737]  You can't trust the media.
[01:22:13.737 --> 01:22:14.978]  People have a right to question.
[01:22:14.978 --> 01:22:19.120]  But to just take that thing and then use it to ban me on the Internet.
[01:22:20.515 --> 01:22:27.621]  And then start banning everybody else and everybody's proud because, well, we're still on the internet because we played ball.
[01:22:27.621 --> 01:22:29.663]  It's disgraceful!
[01:22:29.663 --> 01:22:35.408]  It's Benedict Arnold crap!
[01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:45.616]  And I told people at the time, I said, listen, you're just getting rid of your own damn free speech if you don't stand up for me.
[01:22:45.616 --> 01:22:47.618]  And the lies they would tell, you know,
[01:22:48.729 --> 01:23:03.859]  My daughter, one of my daughters, said to me, I'm going to go on your calls, said to me this weekend, Dad, I was told that you beat up a 10 year old, that's why you were taken off of YouTube.
[01:23:03.859 --> 01:23:05.941]  Now that's the reason they give, child endangerment.
[01:23:05.941 --> 01:23:16.168]  I played an ABC News clip, it was all over the news, everybody else could play it, of a big 10 year old hitting an adult,
[01:23:17.714 --> 01:23:23.118]  Like six, seven times and the adult pushes him down and the kid cries and all the stuff.
[01:23:23.118 --> 01:23:25.800]  And the news, some of them said that I did that.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.382]  They said that was me.
[01:23:29.382 --> 01:23:38.989]  And I got Forbes and a few others new attractions, but to this day, people believe that.
[01:23:38.989 --> 01:23:42.911]  That's, that's the power of fake news.
[01:23:42.911 --> 01:23:45.053]  And you know, I'm not going to say who told my daughter that.
[01:23:46.135 --> 01:23:50.118]  But I'm sure anyone can have a wild guess.
[01:23:50.118 --> 01:23:53.541]  But the left doesn't care what's true or not.
[01:23:53.541 --> 01:23:58.004]  They know this stuff isn't true.
[01:23:58.004 --> 01:23:59.265]  But they don't care.
[01:23:59.265 --> 01:24:07.371]  The last time I got banned on YouTube, like six, seven years ago, we showed the WikiLeaks video of the minivan getting shot up.
[01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:11.511]  And we were like late to that story a couple days.
[01:24:11.511 --> 01:24:14.954]  It was on every news channel in the world.
[01:24:14.954 --> 01:24:19.397]  And then we showed it, and we got taken down, and then we appealed and stuff, and they put us back up.
[01:24:19.397 --> 01:24:22.700]  But that's what I deal with, and I'm not complaining.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:32.907]  I'm just saying, once they're able to misrepresent who we are and get us off the air, then they can take everybody off the air.
[01:24:32.907 --> 01:24:36.090]  Oh, and Joe's argument is, well, Alex, I'll have you back on.
[01:24:37.486 --> 01:24:39.227]  You know, once all your litigation's over.
[01:24:39.227 --> 01:24:44.931]  Well, by that string of thought, anybody ever being litigated against could not ever be interviewed anywhere.
[01:24:44.931 --> 01:24:47.172]  CNN's probably got 200 lawsuits against them.
[01:24:47.172 --> 01:24:49.794]  Fox News has probably 200 at any one time.
[01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:53.016]  That's part of a big media company that just comes from the territory.
[01:24:53.016 --> 01:24:56.138]  What city doesn't have 100 lawsuits against it at any one time?
[01:24:56.138 --> 01:24:57.598]  Or county?
[01:24:57.598 --> 01:25:01.061]  Hell, big cities have thousands of lawsuits, tens of thousands.
[01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:02.882]  Oh, the city's closed, we have lawsuits!
[01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:07.692]  The federal government probably has a million ongoing lawsuits against him.
[01:25:07.692 --> 01:25:08.913]  Seriously, about a million.
[01:25:08.913 --> 01:25:10.213]  You look it up.
[01:25:10.213 --> 01:25:14.095]  Well, just shut the federal government down.
[01:25:14.095 --> 01:25:17.756]  But see, it's that guilty until proven innocent.
[01:25:17.756 --> 01:25:25.319]  Oh, we can't let you defend yourself anywhere on the internet, and we can't have you on because
[01:25:27.332 --> 01:25:28.193]  We'll get taken off.
[01:25:28.193 --> 01:25:29.674]  That's really what it is.
[01:25:29.674 --> 01:25:32.497]  Is that the orders have come down.
[01:25:32.497 --> 01:25:34.879]  You don't let Jones on to defend himself.
[01:25:34.879 --> 01:25:38.943]  He has to be silenced so we can then lie about him.
[01:25:38.943 --> 01:25:43.767]  And then men don't take that as a threat to their own rights.
[01:25:43.767 --> 01:25:46.529]  Women don't take that as a threat to their own rights.
[01:25:46.529 --> 01:25:47.911]  And they don't circle the wagons.
[01:25:49.281 --> 01:25:58.988]  And so they pick us off every day, another personality taking down, another person bullied, another person removed, another person shut up until it's everybody.
[01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:08.915]  And then Howard Stern, I finally went and listened to the tape because so many people told me about it, repeatedly attacked me and said that I needed to be taken off the air and it was a good thing.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.541]  I mean, the only claim he had was that he was free speech.
[01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:17.122]  This guy has NAMBLA on and makes jokes about child molestation.
[01:26:17.122 --> 01:26:24.545]  This guy has Nazis on for hours saying the most horrible crap you could ever imagine and turning it into entertainment.
[01:26:24.545 --> 01:26:27.906]  He has a right to do that.
[01:26:27.906 --> 01:26:35.029]  But oh, they run a giant PR campaign that I'm doing things I haven't done and then you just get the PR slip.
[01:26:35.029 --> 01:26:38.070]  Corporate wants you to say this on air and you get the slip.
[01:26:39.639 --> 01:26:47.263]  Or you get invited to a university to talk to a group of faculty and really they're spooks.
[01:26:47.263 --> 01:26:47.603]  And so...
[01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:56.464]  You go down to the university and you sit and you talk to the people and they explain, oh, Joe, you've got a very important position.
[01:26:56.464 --> 01:26:59.585]  It's kind of the modern Jimmy Carson of our world.
[01:26:59.585 --> 01:27:02.065]  And you're going to need to, you know, help society move forward.
[01:27:02.065 --> 01:27:03.205]  And we've got a larger plan.
[01:27:03.205 --> 01:27:06.146]  And, you know, this whole nationalist movement is out of control.
[01:27:06.146 --> 01:27:07.846]  It's a crisis.
[01:27:07.846 --> 01:27:13.687]  And we need to really help you and have you help us contain what's happening.
[01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:16.368]  Because if we don't, Joe, there's going to be a civil war.
[01:27:16.368 --> 01:27:17.828]  But really, they're the ones
[01:27:19.344 --> 01:27:21.950]  Yeah, Joe, I know the speech you got.
[01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:24.777]  I don't just know about the speech, I know the speech.
[01:27:24.777 --> 01:27:27.684]  So, this is how they operate.
[01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:33.451]  And people go, oh my God, I just got visited by the CIA.
[01:27:33.451 --> 01:27:36.472]  I better go along with them because that's scary.
[01:27:36.472 --> 01:27:37.792]  No, that's not the CIA.
[01:27:37.792 --> 01:27:46.775]  That's a bunch of criminal, academic scum that have infested our damn government and that work with radical Islam and every other evil thing on the planet.
[01:27:46.775 --> 01:27:51.157]  And nobody's children are safe while these people are in charge.
[01:27:51.157 --> 01:27:51.557]  Nobody!
[01:27:53.015 --> 01:28:06.618]  Now bear with me callers, I apologize, but if the Hare lips the Admiral, and water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, I'm gonna go to John and Eric and Jacob and Justin and Bob and Caleb and D-Ray and Craig and all of you, and we'll take the calls with Dan Lyman.
[01:28:06.618 --> 01:28:10.980]  I shouldn't have as many guests and calls, because I want the guests and I want the calls, but we're gonna do it.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:19.982]  And then they trigger me, putting up Joe's face on the screen, because I don't care about being lied about by all the other big shows, because I don't know Lester Holt.
[01:28:21.348 --> 01:28:23.331]  I know Hillary Clinton's a liar.
[01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:28.717]  I know the walking poster boy for who I would cast as a pedophile in a movie.
[01:28:28.717 --> 01:28:30.119]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[01:28:30.119 --> 01:28:32.322]  Ryan Skelter is a liar.
[01:28:32.322 --> 01:28:38.810]  But when you know the inside baseball of people going along with the system
[01:28:40.245 --> 01:28:43.247]  Out of fear, it really makes you lose faith.
[01:28:43.247 --> 01:28:43.747]  But you know what?
[01:28:43.747 --> 01:28:47.490]  Our audience is awesome, and you've stood with us, and we're stronger than ever in many ways.
[01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:49.851]  So you do give me faith going into 2019.
[01:28:49.851 --> 01:28:52.353]  I salute and thank all the listeners, everybody else.
[01:28:52.353 --> 01:28:54.554]  By the way, everybody holding already, get their number.
[01:28:54.554 --> 01:28:55.455]  We're gonna give them a free gift.
[01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:56.616]  And we're gonna go to their calls.
[01:28:57.262 --> 01:29:06.167]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:07.268]  Silver Lungs.

[01:29:24.739 --> 01:29:26.440]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:31.631]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:29:31.631 --> 01:29:35.872]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:35.872 --> 01:29:37.273]  The Bug Assault.
[01:29:37.273 --> 01:29:42.934]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[01:29:42.934 --> 01:29:45.335]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[01:29:45.335 --> 01:29:48.676]  So much fun, you'll forget you have a wife and kids!
[01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:50.516]  Makes the perfect stocking stuffer.
[01:29:50.516 --> 01:29:54.797]  Get your Bug Assault today and save $10 on the Bug Beam Laser Combo.
[01:29:54.797 --> 01:29:56.278]  Only at BugAssault.com.
[01:29:58.325 --> 01:30:03.488]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:30:03.488 --> 01:30:05.429]  That's the globalist only hope.
[01:30:05.429 --> 01:30:24.641]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[01:30:24.901 --> 01:30:31.143]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[01:30:31.143 --> 01:30:36.784]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[01:30:36.784 --> 01:30:39.285]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[01:30:39.285 --> 01:30:40.406]  Every order gets free shipping.
[01:30:40.406 --> 01:30:43.606]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance.
[01:30:43.606 --> 01:30:52.289]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[01:30:52.509 --> 01:30:54.210]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:55.451]  I salute you all.
[01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:57.833]  Now please take action at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:07.645 --> 01:31:09.828]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:31:09.828 --> 01:31:18.538]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:31:18.538 --> 01:31:23.143]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:31:23.143 --> 01:31:24.584]  You are the info war.
[01:31:24.584 --> 01:31:28.128]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:31:28.789 --> 01:31:30.270]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning!
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.922]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:32:03.922 --> 01:32:13.685]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:32:13.685 --> 01:32:21.767]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:32:22.759 --> 01:32:30.683]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:32:30.683 --> 01:32:33.785]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:32:33.785 --> 01:32:35.286]  It really is amazing.
[01:32:35.286 --> 01:32:41.989]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:44.671]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:32:45.962 --> 01:32:47.523]  Of Infowars.
[01:32:47.523 --> 01:32:48.803]  So please spread the links.
[01:32:48.803 --> 01:32:52.165]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:52.165 --> 01:32:55.467]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:32:55.467 --> 01:32:56.807]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:32:56.807 --> 01:33:01.329]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:33:01.329 --> 01:33:03.971]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.781 --> 01:33:26.105]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:26.105 --> 01:33:28.526]  Most systems that have been set up by the mega corporations
[01:33:30.336 --> 01:33:38.960]  ...are designed to get followers into their process and then advance followers because they're conformists.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:45.862]  But conformity isn't popular in the human species, especially in who people want to follow.
[01:33:45.862 --> 01:33:51.125]  So you want followers who pose as leaders who are really conformists.
[01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:54.026]  But when you come down to a revolutionary period like we're in globally,
[01:33:56.192 --> 01:33:59.856]  You really begin to see just how conformist most people are.
[01:33:59.856 --> 01:34:12.148]  But it makes me admire Michael Savage that he wouldn't sell out and wouldn't try to take down Trump so they're cancelling his show and replacing him with Ben Shapiro.
[01:34:12.148 --> 01:34:15.272]  It makes me admire Matt Drudge that he hasn't backed down in support of Trump.
[01:34:16.223 --> 01:34:18.504]  It makes me admire all of you.
[01:34:18.504 --> 01:34:26.569]  It doesn't mean Trump's perfect, but boy, he's been fighting hard and they sure hate his guts because he's taken power away from the globalists and putting it back in America.
[01:34:26.569 --> 01:34:31.652]  And the good news is, it's happening all over the world.
[01:34:31.652 --> 01:34:38.957]  And Dan Lyman, who heads up EuropeWars.com, our European division, who does an amazing job, has been there for many of the Yellow Vest demonstrations.
[01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:41.171]  He's been covering it all.
[01:34:41.171 --> 01:34:46.256]  He lives in Switzerland, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from Paris, France.
[01:34:46.256 --> 01:34:49.339]  And he has been there covering it in detail.
[01:34:49.339 --> 01:34:50.299]  Chronicle for us.
[01:34:50.299 --> 01:34:51.160]  So much has happened.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.602]  Then we'll go to calls.
[01:34:52.602 --> 01:34:53.843]  What's been happening, Dan?
[01:34:53.843 --> 01:35:01.029]  Because there's been so much pulling down EU flags, armored EU vehicles showing up, top French generals saying Macron's a traitor.
[01:35:02.099 --> 01:35:04.321]  them storming government buildings.
[01:35:04.321 --> 01:35:05.882]  I mean, wow!
[01:35:05.882 --> 01:35:12.247]  The media, seven weeks ago, tried to brand this as just a gasoline price, you know, protest.
[01:35:12.247 --> 01:35:13.608]  But no!
[01:35:13.608 --> 01:35:19.313]  As you've been saying for seven weeks, as you've interviewed the people, they are nationalists, they are patriots.
[01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:23.036]  So, Dan, break this down for us and thanks for joining us.
[01:35:24.221 --> 01:35:26.142]  Great to be back with you, Alex, and Merry Christmas.
[01:35:26.142 --> 01:35:29.162]  Yeah, it's just, it's amazing that they continue.
[01:35:29.162 --> 01:35:33.104]  I think that everyone thought that this would just be a kind of a thing that would fizzle out.
[01:35:33.104 --> 01:35:43.747]  I know the media has been doing, working very hard to present this as a movement that is waning, but if you look kind of through the mainstream media deception, it does seem to be continuing.
[01:35:43.747 --> 01:35:50.909]  I'm sure there are some people who can't get out every weekend, so maybe it's more the diehards that are still out there keeping the flame lit, but
[01:35:54.278 --> 01:35:54.598]  I think so.
[01:36:12.944 --> 01:36:13.144]  I think so.
[01:36:34.435 --> 01:36:41.740]  And let's be clear, he stays a lot of the time at an armored fortress off the coast with 50 foot walls.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.142]  We put that back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:36:44.142 --> 01:36:46.083]  He says Europe shouldn't have walls.
[01:36:46.083 --> 01:36:47.264]  Citizens shouldn't have walls.
[01:36:47.264 --> 01:36:57.011]  They're forcing French, German, Swedish, Italian citizens to take up to a dozen per family illegal aliens into their houses.
[01:36:57.011 --> 01:37:03.736]  But oh look, he's got big old 30, 40, 50 foot walls all around an armored fortress
[01:37:04.357 --> 01:37:07.944]  On an island, just like all the rest of these elitists do.
[01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:10.291]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:12.992]  Just like Obama, just like the Vatican.
[01:37:12.992 --> 01:37:17.113]  So, safety for me, but not for thee.
[01:37:17.113 --> 01:37:19.113]  And you can tell these people, I mean, they're still going.
[01:37:19.113 --> 01:37:19.813]  It's incredible.
[01:37:19.813 --> 01:37:22.074]  And this movement is spreading across the world.
[01:37:22.074 --> 01:37:30.376]  I've seen videos in Lebanon, in Iraq, of course in Belgium, and in surrounding countries, in UK, even a little bit in Canada.
[01:37:30.376 --> 01:37:35.857]  It has become a very symbolic movement of people who are tired of the way the elites are reigning over them.
[01:37:36.516 --> 01:37:40.784]  And now we've seen Syrian women and others say, please send our men back.
[01:37:40.784 --> 01:37:42.807]  They've almost sent everybody out of these countries.
[01:37:42.807 --> 01:37:45.572]  This is a literal globalist colonization operation.
[01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:49.203]  Not only are they not sending them back, they're bringing in more.
[01:37:49.203 --> 01:37:59.711]  I just did a story last week that Sweden announced they were going to be setting a new quota for the coming year where they would be flying in 5,000 more migrants from the Middle East and Africa.
[01:37:59.711 --> 01:38:01.112]  So they're actively seeking migrants.
[01:38:01.112 --> 01:38:03.474]  By the way, she did this going back over six years.
[01:38:03.474 --> 01:38:10.479]  They always give 1,000, a 10,000, a 5,000 number as the cover so people go, oh, that's just those flights, and then it's a million.
[01:38:11.658 --> 01:38:11.938]  Right.
[01:38:11.938 --> 01:38:27.288]  And can you imagine, I mean, the amount of manpower and resources it takes to fly people from the Middle East and from Africa and then from some of these camps in Greece and whatnot and actually bring them in on airplanes to these airports and the security risks as well.
[01:38:27.288 --> 01:38:29.229]  I mean, the things that we all go through.
[01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:34.032]  I happen to be in the States right now just visiting family for the holidays and just the flying experience in the States.
[01:38:34.412 --> 01:38:37.013]  I was in Catalonia a few years ago, in Spain, and then I was also in Italy for a week.
[01:38:59.915 --> 01:39:24.474]  And all the Italians did was complain, and every tree in Rome, there's hardly any, in little bitty park areas, would have a couple hundred people under it, and people crapping everywhere, and the Italians complaining, yes, last week ISIS stabbed three police here, and now they keep them away from the monuments, but they're down every, and you go down side streets,
[01:39:25.934 --> 01:39:26.034]  It's
[01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:49.536]  We're good to go.
[01:40:12.581 --> 01:40:21.608]  The weather gets bad so now they've basically commandeered this entire metro station where they're all living in there and they just made it their home, a de facto migrant camp.
[01:40:21.608 --> 01:40:27.592]  They play soccer down there, they use it as their garbage disposal and they just basically have taken the whole thing over.
[01:40:27.592 --> 01:40:30.555]  Now to put that into perspective, that would be like
[01:40:31.869 --> 01:40:32.790]  Now we have Merkel last week.
[01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:36.192]  Tell folks what she said in a speech last week and again this weekend about nationalism.
[01:40:55.956 --> 01:41:00.822]  Yeah, I mean, she's coming out hard against nationalism, even on her way out the door.
[01:41:00.822 --> 01:41:10.855]  I did catch a little bit of that speech earlier that she was just constantly, you know, advancing the globalist agenda, even as her power wanes.
[01:41:14.224 --> 01:41:18.467]  And she's just relegated the chairmanship of her party.
[01:41:18.467 --> 01:41:20.748]  I mean, this lady is going to fight down to the bitter end.
[01:41:20.748 --> 01:41:22.670]  You have to wonder where she's going to go from here.
[01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:28.474]  Is she going to just basically slide into EU government, perhaps, at the non-elected level?
[01:41:28.474 --> 01:41:29.675]  That remains to be seen.
[01:41:29.675 --> 01:41:32.657]  But Germany is in a critical situation as well.
[01:41:32.657 --> 01:41:35.739]  And she's basically been the architect of that or the facilitator.
[01:41:35.739 --> 01:41:41.703]  And it's sad to see these scenes, those kinds of scenes that you're showing on screen, are not uncommon around Europe.
[01:41:42.082 --> 01:41:44.043]  And now they're running the same play against the U.S.
[01:41:44.043 --> 01:41:45.784]  and a bigger migrant horde's coming.
[01:41:45.784 --> 01:41:47.164]  And then there'll be more children that die!
[01:41:47.164 --> 01:41:53.708]  And then when they die, it's our fault that their parents brought them over 2, 3, 4 thousand miles and smuggled them and did all this.
[01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:54.228]  It's our fault!
[01:41:55.757 --> 01:42:01.522]  Right, and there's another migrant situation developing, a new one here that is starting to get coverage.
[01:42:01.522 --> 01:42:12.151]  It's getting a lot of UK press coverage, but basically migrants are now setting sail across the Channel from France, and they've had a serious spike in the last six to eight weeks.
[01:42:12.151 --> 01:42:14.753]  They intercepted five boats alone on Christmas
[01:42:14.753 --> 01:42:14.953]  Thank you.

[01:45:03.928 --> 01:45:16.157]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing as being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[01:45:16.157 --> 01:45:26.145]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:45:26.145 --> 01:45:26.745]  Everybody knows
[01:45:27.642 --> 01:45:34.910]  Who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:37.573]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:45:37.573 --> 01:45:40.276]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:45:40.276 --> 01:45:42.218]  2018 has been insane.
[01:45:42.218 --> 01:45:48.665]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:45:49.537 --> 01:45:53.219]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:45:53.219 --> 01:45:58.562]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[01:45:58.562 --> 01:46:01.644]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food.
[01:46:01.644 --> 01:46:04.566]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.566 --> 01:46:07.528]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:11.570]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply.
[01:46:13.143 --> 01:46:22.290]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[01:46:41.125 --> 01:46:42.206]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.

[01:47:01.234 --> 01:47:03.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.535 --> 01:47:10.576]  I don't think so.
[01:47:54.446 --> 01:48:00.187]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's an article up on Infowars.com that's absolutely critical.
[01:48:00.187 --> 01:48:01.568]  I hope you get it out to everyone you know.
[01:48:01.568 --> 01:48:03.828]  It's by Mindy Robinson.
[01:48:03.828 --> 01:48:07.849]  Twitter censors conservatives but won't ban pedophiles.
[01:48:07.849 --> 01:48:20.612]  And I read the article earlier today and it is just astounding how far this has gone and how there are giant Twitter accounts dedicated to recruiting children for sex and getting sex with children legalized.
[01:48:21.417 --> 01:48:26.939]  And then through school, child education programs, they're openly pushing it on children as well.
[01:48:26.939 --> 01:48:28.220]  They're making their move.
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:38.864]  Instead of a Tet Offensive, it's a pedophile offensive, where they just hit you on every front until you just get overwhelmed and accept it.
[01:48:38.864 --> 01:48:40.424]  So the article's very important.
[01:48:40.424 --> 01:48:43.266]  Send it to all parents you know, all educators you know.
[01:48:43.266 --> 01:48:44.486]  We've got to stand against this.
[01:48:44.486 --> 01:48:46.887]  All right, I want to take some calls from all over the map here.
[01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:48.107]  Dan, you're a smart guy.
[01:48:48.107 --> 01:48:48.988]  You can respond to them.
[01:48:50.014 --> 01:49:04.639]  But I wanted to ask you, why do you think Merkel, why do you think Macron, why do you think the EU, the globalists, are just coming out and saying, no borders, no walls, no Europe, no USA at all, and openly saying, we're going to ignore voters.
[01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:07.340]  We're going to have an EU army that forces you to do it.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:16.623]  We're just going to, and then, I mean, it's so clear they're conquering everyone, and saying they're going to have the UN run the world for the migrant crisis they created.
[01:49:16.623 --> 01:49:17.443]  It's so simple.
[01:49:17.443 --> 01:49:19.224]  This is the vehicle of global domination.
[01:49:20.563 --> 01:49:28.006]  And how they get the average leftist, when this is designed to bankrupt our countries and our pension funds, how they get the average leftist to go along with it.
[01:49:28.006 --> 01:49:31.487]  A. Why do you think they are being so bold?
[01:49:31.487 --> 01:49:37.670]  And then B. I look at the elections, the socialists are now joining nationalists because they don't want to go bankrupt.
[01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:40.171]  It isn't working, Dan!
[01:49:40.171 --> 01:49:43.692]  Right, you do have some, even some left-wing groups that are starting to come out against
[01:49:48.566 --> 01:49:48.766]  I think?
[01:50:18.166 --> 01:50:19.386]  They're probably under, you know, protection.
[01:50:19.386 --> 01:50:20.527]  They'll live in their mansions.
[01:50:20.527 --> 01:50:21.747]  They'll live in their palaces.
[01:50:21.747 --> 01:50:24.608]  So I think they're living for the here and the now.
[01:50:24.608 --> 01:50:38.431]  And there are probably much darker things going on behind the scenes that relate perhaps to your previous story with Mindy Robinson and pedophilia and just the way that these people are compromised and the people that they answer to as well.
[01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:44.873]  And recently I did a story, Franz Timmermans, who is now running to replace Juncker as the head of the EU.
[01:50:44.873 --> 01:50:46.413]  He's currently the vice president.
[01:50:46.853 --> 01:50:47.073]  I think?
[01:51:09.753 --> 01:51:11.375]  Our destinies are linked.
[01:51:31.997 --> 01:51:43.459]  Which they admit is the management of bringing in groups that won't integrate, who don't get in the melting pot, who on average five years later, 90 plus percent don't have a job because they don't even let them get jobs.
[01:51:43.459 --> 01:51:50.081]  You bring them into these social welfare states, they don't contribute, to have a totally divided population divide and conquer.
[01:51:50.081 --> 01:51:51.861]  It's just astounding.
[01:51:51.861 --> 01:51:56.322]  This is 21st century warfare directed by the globalists.
[01:51:56.322 --> 01:51:56.982]  It is simply
[01:51:57.802 --> 01:51:58.883]  Astounding.
[01:51:58.883 --> 01:52:04.625]  It should be so clear-cut for everyone to stand against this, Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[01:52:04.625 --> 01:52:05.425]  Absolutely.
[01:52:05.425 --> 01:52:13.148]  You know, you had mentioned that in Italy there's like, you know, you catch these stories, oh three jihadists stabbed a policeman.
[01:52:13.148 --> 01:52:23.933]  That is something that I've noticed more and more with the coverage that we've been doing for Europe Wars is that there are so many things that happen on a daily basis that get glossed over, they get passing coverage,
[01:52:23.933 --> 01:52:25.314]  You'll hear a German man raped a woman.
[01:52:25.314 --> 01:52:26.374]  No, it's not a German man.
[01:52:41.295 --> 01:52:42.096]  Exactly.
[01:52:42.096 --> 01:52:51.084]  Today they just uncovered 2,000 pounds of fireworks in a Hamburg home while they say it was a 23-year-old man.
[01:52:51.084 --> 01:52:57.730]  At Hanover Airport in Germany, somebody managed to penetrate through security and drive a vehicle onto the tarmac.
[01:52:58.350 --> 01:53:02.433]  You have cars being set on fire all the time across Sweden and across France.
[01:53:02.433 --> 01:53:05.636]  By the way, thousands a day sometimes, usually hundreds a day.
[01:53:05.636 --> 01:53:11.921]  I mean, we're talking hundreds per city per night and sometimes in countries over a thousand a night.
[01:53:11.921 --> 01:53:13.021]  We've shown the video.
[01:53:13.021 --> 01:53:14.683]  It's like something out of an apocalypse.
[01:53:15.891 --> 01:53:32.169]  It is, and we see that of course during the mass protests, but it could just be any old given night, and they'll blame it on back-to-school unrest or poverty, and it's like a lot of people are seeing one of their most important possessions just turned into ashes, and I don't know how people put up with that.
[01:53:32.329 --> 01:53:36.731]  And why are the Islamists from Africa and the Middle East doing this?
[01:53:36.731 --> 01:53:37.771]  Because they admit they're doing it.
[01:53:37.771 --> 01:53:41.653]  They even admit now in Germany, well, there's a new group preying on migrants, Muslims.
[01:53:41.653 --> 01:53:44.094]  Well, yeah, they're recruiting them into their gangs.
[01:53:44.094 --> 01:53:50.337]  And then now you finally see generals and national police saying, our civilization basically has collapsed.
[01:53:50.337 --> 01:53:51.478]  We need to stop this.
[01:53:51.478 --> 01:53:58.261]  So there does seem to be a moment in Europe where they're saying we need to either evacuate or do something.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:03.462]  Absolutely, and there are things, grumblings under the surface.
[01:54:03.462 --> 01:54:12.166]  If you recall a few weeks ago, there was a group of about 200 special forces and veterans from the military in Germany who they arrested.
[01:54:12.166 --> 01:54:15.328]  They were planning a plot to basically overthrow Merkel.
[01:54:15.328 --> 01:54:17.389]  Of course, they branded these guys as neon Nazis.
[01:54:17.389 --> 01:54:19.290]  Maybe they were, I couldn't speak to that.
[01:54:19.290 --> 01:54:23.312]  But you have people start, coalitions starting to form under the surface.
[01:54:23.312 --> 01:54:23.592]  You saw
[01:54:23.672 --> 01:54:27.994]  The French police in many cases... The French serving top generals said the same thing.
[01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:29.855]  And of course they're not white supremacists come out.
[01:54:29.855 --> 01:54:33.376]  It's just that they're saying there's a plot to end the country.
[01:54:33.376 --> 01:54:34.237]  We have to take action.
[01:54:35.191 --> 01:54:37.553]  Right, there's only so much that they can take.
[01:54:37.553 --> 01:54:45.139]  Just last week, you had a top Swedish police officer who's in charge of gang-related warfare, basically, investigating that in Stockholm.
[01:54:45.139 --> 01:54:57.068]  He's a security expert, and he said that because Sweden just reached their highest number of shooting deaths ever in the country's history, he thinks that the country is entering a state of war.
[01:54:57.068 --> 01:54:58.029]  That's what he compared it to.
[01:54:58.029 --> 01:55:00.851]  Those were his words, not ours.
[01:55:00.851 --> 01:55:01.752]  It is a state of war.
[01:55:01.752 --> 01:55:03.173]  These people have been brought here to conquer.
[01:55:03.173 --> 01:55:04.034]  Their Imams say it.
[01:55:04.963 --> 01:55:06.764]  Christmas is worse than murder!
[01:55:06.764 --> 01:55:07.625]  Take their women!
[01:55:07.625 --> 01:55:08.306]  They are weak!
[01:55:08.306 --> 01:55:10.487]  We will kill them all!
[01:55:10.487 --> 01:55:23.637]  Those are quotes of top imams broadcast on British and German television and they have national state-run TV telling young preteen girls to get a Muslim husband by 14 that they are the best.
[01:55:23.637 --> 01:55:26.079]  So that's the left tucking your daughters, folks.
[01:55:27.125 --> 01:55:29.406]  Well, there's two points I'd like to make.
[01:55:29.406 --> 01:55:33.427]  First of all, I think that my idea of locking down Congress and the Senate in full session
[01:55:56.365 --> 01:55:57.626]  Well, I mean, sir, we have reached that point.
[01:55:57.626 --> 01:56:00.669]  That's what Germany, France, all the military leaders are saying.
[01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:01.849]  That's what this is.
[01:56:01.849 --> 01:56:05.933]  We aren't seeing our countries destroyed right now.
[01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:47.485]  Well, you know, somebody on your show a couple years ago when Trump first started running for president and had an idea where Trump should just go in there and kick out all the bad doers out of Congress and have a special general election to repopulate the seats and then put everybody on notice that if they don't work together, they're going to be arrested for sedation.
[01:56:47.485 --> 01:56:48.346]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:56:49.392 --> 01:56:52.153]  I would say that's authoritarianism if you're the one that does it first.
[01:56:52.153 --> 01:57:01.355]  But the globalists are lawlessly plunging our economy, lawlessly opening our borders for child trafficking, lawlessly allowing daily cop killing, lawlessly trying to bankrupt.
[01:57:01.355 --> 01:57:07.197]  All the top generals are saying, we're in a state of war, the countries are collapsing, Europe's only five years ahead of us.
[01:57:07.197 --> 01:57:11.118]  So the left has put us into the civil emergency.
[01:57:11.118 --> 01:57:16.879]  So Trump should declare a new emergency to kill Obama's emergency that he put us under two and a half years ago.
[01:57:16.879 --> 01:57:18.260]  See, that's the little secret.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:27.064]  Is Obama put us under a civil emergency and Trump doesn't understand how to get rid of it because he's surrounded by a bunch of traitors like the ones he just kicked out.
[01:57:27.064 --> 01:57:27.525]  Thank you, John.
[01:57:27.525 --> 01:57:30.246]  We'll get Dan Lyman's take on that and more calls straight ahead.
[01:57:30.246 --> 01:57:35.569]  Then, saw the story, top story on drugreport.com over the weekend and InfoWars.com.
[01:57:35.569 --> 01:57:40.511]  The fellow that went into the vape shop and the libtard went crazy on him.
[01:57:40.511 --> 01:57:42.832]  He said, do my bidding.
[01:57:42.832 --> 01:57:43.773]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:57:43.773 --> 01:57:44.834]  He joined us last night, too.
[01:57:44.834 --> 01:57:45.394]  He's pretty funny.
[01:57:47.318 --> 01:57:52.839]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:57:52.839 --> 01:58:02.601]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:58:02.601 --> 01:58:10.683]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:58:11.687 --> 01:58:19.589]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:22.709]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:24.210]  It really is amazing.
[01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:30.911]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:58:30.911 --> 01:58:33.532]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:36.431]  Of Infowars.
[01:58:36.431 --> 01:58:37.732]  So please spread the links.
[01:58:37.732 --> 01:58:41.095]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:41.095 --> 01:58:44.397]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:58:44.397 --> 01:58:45.718]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:46.839]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:58:52.455 --> 01:58:58.178]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:58:58.178 --> 01:59:06.041]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:09.203]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:59:09.383 --> 01:59:14.666]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:59:14.666 --> 01:59:17.448]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:59:17.448 --> 01:59:26.413]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:59:26.573 --> 01:59:27.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.168 --> 02:00:19.372]  I'm no stranger to the rain I'm a friend of thunder Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
[02:00:19.372 --> 02:00:24.734]  I fought with the devil Got down on his level
[02:00:28.194 --> 02:00:30.115]  I'll tell you, Dan Lyman, we've got to get him on more.
[02:00:30.115 --> 02:00:32.596]  He is a smart cookie.
[02:00:32.596 --> 02:00:34.897]  He works with Infowars, does a great job.
[02:00:34.897 --> 02:00:37.058]  Europewars.com.
[02:00:37.058 --> 02:00:40.380]  Got any tips for him, go there and email him or you want to host him in your country.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:44.402]  You want to get this man on the road more because he always knocks shit out of the park.
[02:00:44.402 --> 02:00:46.342]  Trying to form a team for him over there in Europe.
[02:00:46.342 --> 02:00:47.943]  Didn't even plug last hour.
[02:00:47.943 --> 02:00:49.564]  But that's how you fund the operation.
[02:00:49.564 --> 02:00:50.624]  Biggest sales in our history.
[02:00:50.624 --> 02:00:52.385]  They're going to have to end today or tomorrow.
[02:00:52.385 --> 02:00:53.246]  They're year-end sales.
[02:00:54.666 --> 02:00:58.247]  The Franchise Tax, Texas has that as an inventory tax.
[02:00:58.247 --> 02:00:59.607]  There's also a federal one as well.
[02:00:59.607 --> 02:01:00.727]  So we're trying to sell everything.
[02:01:00.727 --> 02:01:02.188]  Got a lot of great products.
[02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:04.828]  Biggest sales ever in fullworthstore.com.
[02:01:04.828 --> 02:01:07.989]  But let's take a few more calls here.
[02:01:07.989 --> 02:01:10.189]  Let's talk to Bob in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:10.990]  Thanks for holding, Bob.
[02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:11.510]  You're on the air.
[02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:13.390]  Go ahead.
[02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:15.511]  Well, Alex, just a comment.
[02:01:15.511 --> 02:01:21.032]  New Year's Eve wish and say something about one of your shirts.
[02:01:21.032 --> 02:01:21.592]  Okay, thank you.
[02:01:23.061 --> 02:01:27.485]  I'm very happy that you found your calling because America needs you.
[02:01:27.485 --> 02:01:29.926]  You're the right man at the right time.
[02:01:29.926 --> 02:01:32.168]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:32.168 --> 02:01:45.679]  My New Year's Eve wish is that the Democrats keep coming after President Trump and that he releases all those documents you said that are being
[02:01:46.468 --> 02:01:46.668]  Yes.
[02:01:46.668 --> 02:01:47.569]  Well that's right.
[02:01:47.569 --> 02:01:48.810]  If the President doesn't know...
[02:02:00.956 --> 02:02:04.777]  They've got the knives out for him and they're gonna lie to him and say they're gonna compromise?
[02:02:04.777 --> 02:02:05.958]  They're not going to.
[02:02:05.958 --> 02:02:08.699]  The last time I talked to him, I said, sure, you gotta drop the hammer.
[02:02:08.699 --> 02:02:10.539]  They're not gonna stop.
[02:02:10.539 --> 02:02:14.601]  And so, and his answer was, well, Alex, you just don't stop.
[02:02:14.601 --> 02:02:16.442]  Keep fighting, fight as hard as you can.
[02:02:16.442 --> 02:02:17.262]  But that's...
[02:02:17.802 --> 02:02:29.325]  And just imagine, Kelly and Mattis would lie to him and tell him whatever he wanted to hear and then not go implement it, and then Kelly is on TV bragging that he would basically sabotage what the President wanted to do.
[02:02:29.325 --> 02:02:33.607]  It's just these guys are just jerks, but see, they're cowards.
[02:02:33.607 --> 02:02:37.568]  They want their pension, they want their money, and they sit there and laugh.
[02:02:37.568 --> 02:02:39.568]  But let me tell you something.
[02:02:39.568 --> 02:02:40.969]  The bylaw in D.C.
[02:02:40.969 --> 02:02:42.489]  is talk crap about Trump.
[02:02:42.489 --> 02:02:43.589]  Now he's an idiot.
[02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:45.630]  Even his supporters do it, and it's pathetic.
[02:02:46.795 --> 02:02:48.896]  Anything else, Bob?
[02:02:48.896 --> 02:02:52.379]  I don't know where this is going to turn out, but I say bring it on.
[02:02:52.379 --> 02:03:00.584]  But the last t-shirt that I received from you was the Everybody's Alex Jones Don't Tread On Me.
[02:03:00.584 --> 02:03:01.085]  Yes.
[02:03:01.085 --> 02:03:02.866]  That is phenomenal.
[02:03:02.866 --> 02:03:10.331]  The only thing that could make it better is that if it was on the front and the back of the shirt, because I want people to see it when I'm looking in.
[02:03:11.024 --> 02:03:14.406]  They're eyes, and when I'm looking the other way, I want them to see it.
[02:03:14.406 --> 02:03:16.207]  So that's just one.
[02:03:16.207 --> 02:03:16.907]  No, I agree.
[02:03:16.907 --> 02:03:18.208]  In fact, I love that shirt.
[02:03:18.208 --> 02:03:19.688]  And I said, why isn't it printed on the back?
[02:03:19.688 --> 02:03:22.790]  And they said, boss, you're going to give these away free.
[02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:25.051]  They already cost like five bucks.
[02:03:25.051 --> 02:03:27.672]  So everything you print extra is a few more dollars.
[02:03:27.672 --> 02:03:29.353]  But yes, it's funny you say that.
[02:03:29.353 --> 02:03:37.957]  The next version, because that was a limited edition, is coming out with InfoWars.com on the shoulder and an American flag and InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:03:37.957 --> 02:03:39.018]  What do you want to say on the back?
[02:03:40.342 --> 02:03:43.065]  The same thing, uh, don't tread on me.
[02:03:43.065 --> 02:03:44.728]  We're all Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.728 --> 02:03:46.069]  Alright, you are the designer.
[02:03:46.069 --> 02:03:47.912]  We're gonna have that on the back.
[02:03:47.912 --> 02:03:49.674]  We're all Alex Jones, don't tread on me on the back.
[02:03:49.674 --> 02:03:52.698]  In fact, we'll put the same symbol on the back!
[02:03:52.698 --> 02:03:53.939]  Front and back.
[02:03:53.939 --> 02:03:54.680]  You got it.
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.322]  You got it.
[02:03:56.322 --> 02:03:57.123]  Alright, Dan Lyman.
[02:03:58.095 --> 02:03:59.676]  Please come back on every week.
[02:03:59.676 --> 02:04:04.097]  I just want you on every week, and you're on fire, and you're a one-man wrecking crew.
[02:04:04.097 --> 02:04:07.738]  I know you're trying to hire some more folks, but we're really blessed to have you.
[02:04:07.738 --> 02:04:12.360]  In the last 60 seconds we have in this segment, what do you see coming in the new year?
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.101]  I do see an eventful year, of course.
[02:04:15.101 --> 02:04:20.522]  Things are only building momentum right now, and even tonight could be, of course, eventful.
[02:04:20.522 --> 02:04:24.064]  In Paris, they have, in France in general, they're deploying almost 150,000 security
[02:04:26.647 --> 02:04:27.307]  Very well said.
[02:04:27.307 --> 02:04:31.869]  And again, all those security forces should be defending France's border.
[02:04:31.869 --> 02:04:33.750]  Instead, they're suppressing the people.
[02:04:56.172 --> 02:05:01.954]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember, this life is a test.
[02:05:01.954 --> 02:05:14.158]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing us being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[02:05:14.158 --> 02:05:22.781]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[02:05:24.147 --> 02:05:32.915]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and who tend to see it.
[02:05:32.915 --> 02:05:35.598]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[02:05:35.598 --> 02:05:39.401]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[02:05:39.401 --> 02:05:40.242]  2018 has been insane.
[02:05:40.242 --> 02:05:46.688]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[02:05:47.557 --> 02:05:51.242]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[02:05:51.242 --> 02:05:57.790]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[02:05:57.790 --> 02:06:01.856]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:06:01.856 --> 02:06:05.060]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:30.281 --> 02:06:45.434]  We're about to be talking to Ian Ferguson of Georgia.
[02:06:45.434 --> 02:06:47.635]  He walked into a big vape chain.
[02:06:49.142 --> 02:06:53.486]  And instantly began videotaping because he's wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[02:06:53.486 --> 02:06:54.647]  I like the black ones myself.
[02:06:54.647 --> 02:06:55.728]  The one he's wearing now.
[02:06:55.728 --> 02:06:58.531]  We're about to go to him via Skype on his lunch break.
[02:06:58.531 --> 02:07:00.913]  He works on cell towers and other things.
[02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:01.754]  And the guy flips out.
[02:07:01.754 --> 02:07:03.795]  Now here's the beat version.
[02:07:03.795 --> 02:07:06.057]  We have the unbeat version on InfoWars.com.
[02:07:06.057 --> 02:07:07.399]  Became the top story over the weekend.
[02:07:07.399 --> 02:07:08.580]  DrudgeReport.com linked to it.
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:09.220]  Millions of views.
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:13.184]  Because the guy's also screaming the N-word at him.
[02:07:13.184 --> 02:07:15.226]  And it's this weird leftist thing where
[02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:21.583]  There's a black guy in the store, so the white guy wants to virtue signal and say, look, there's a white supremacist Nazi.
[02:07:21.583 --> 02:07:26.004]  The black dude's just laughing at him, saying, you know, give the guy his stuff.
[02:07:26.004 --> 02:07:26.485]  What the hell?
[02:07:26.485 --> 02:07:33.566]  You know, Trump's our president, but these people want to act like we're child molesters.
[02:07:33.566 --> 02:07:35.667]  But then meanwhile, the left's pushing child molestation.
[02:07:36.758 --> 02:07:40.320]  It's crazy, and we could make some great memes out of this guy.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:42.841]  I'm thinking maybe we should do a meme contest with this guy.
[02:07:42.841 --> 02:07:47.163]  Because he squawks like some kind of weird ostrich or something.
[02:07:47.163 --> 02:07:49.445]  I don't know what bird does that's kind of a parrot.
[02:07:49.445 --> 02:07:55.268]  He's like... After a while he's just...
[02:07:59.795 --> 02:08:09.624]  I mean, it's like a duck crossed with a crazy ostrich or something, crossed with a parrot, and you run into them, they all act like this.
[02:08:09.624 --> 02:08:21.676]  I'll walk down the street sometimes, you've seen the video, they'll just go... Or, you know, Trump comes to town, they're like... they have these scream-outs.
[02:08:22.981 --> 02:08:24.861]  Where the liberals go out and just scream at the sky.
[02:08:24.861 --> 02:08:30.463]  So, if you missed it, he's back on with us for a couple segments, but let's play the edited version.
[02:08:30.463 --> 02:08:38.424]  By edited, we bleep out the N-word and all the rest of the stuff that the so-called leftist liberal is screaming at Ian Ferguson.
[02:08:38.424 --> 02:08:39.605]  Here it is.
[02:08:39.605 --> 02:08:44.746]  Here we are at Exhale Vapor City in Tucker, Georgia, and I have just been asked to leave the store.
[02:08:45.959 --> 02:08:46.580]  He greeted me.
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:47.540]  That was nice.
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:49.502]  I did find the item that I wanted.
[02:08:49.502 --> 02:08:52.164]  And the next thing he said was that he'd like me to leave.
[02:08:52.164 --> 02:08:56.167]  If you do not stop recording in my store, I'm going to call the police and ask you to leave now.
[02:08:56.167 --> 02:08:56.707]  Please call the police.
[02:08:56.707 --> 02:08:58.329]  That would be awesome.
[02:08:58.329 --> 02:08:59.429]  That'd be awesome.
[02:08:59.429 --> 02:09:01.271]  We can call Fox 5 and all sorts of stuff.
[02:09:01.271 --> 02:09:05.034]  I'd like to, I would like to purchase something here.
[02:09:05.034 --> 02:09:08.416]  Please do call your boss because I will be calling corporate.
[02:09:08.416 --> 02:09:09.017]  Go for it.
[02:09:09.017 --> 02:09:13.540]  I am looking forward to releasing this video because I just want to purchase something.
[02:09:16.082 --> 02:09:16.483]  Racist.
[02:09:16.483 --> 02:09:16.663]  Yeah.
[02:09:16.663 --> 02:09:16.863]  Sorry.
[02:09:16.863 --> 02:09:18.745]  I'm not racist.
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:34.304]  I don't have a problem with you sir.
[02:09:34.304 --> 02:09:38.968]  I love how the guy's virtue signaling, talking like he's black too.
[02:09:38.968 --> 02:09:40.490]  Sounds all fake like Eminem.
[02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:43.292]  I'd like to purchase some of this naked vape juice though.
[02:09:55.091 --> 02:09:57.653]  Alright, here's where we're at.
[02:09:57.653 --> 02:09:58.333]  Leave the store!
[02:09:58.333 --> 02:09:58.854]  LEAVE THE STORE!
[02:09:58.854 --> 02:09:59.674]  LEAVE THE STORE!
[02:09:59.674 --> 02:10:00.915]  LEAVE THE STORE!
[02:10:00.915 --> 02:10:01.616]  F**K OFF!
[02:10:01.616 --> 02:10:06.640]  I DON'T GIVE A F**K!
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:07.921]  GET OUT!
[02:10:07.921 --> 02:10:08.281]  Dude?
[02:10:08.281 --> 02:10:09.782]  Go ahead, take another swing at it.
[02:10:09.782 --> 02:10:11.383]  Make contact with me one more time.
[02:10:11.383 --> 02:10:12.724]  I'm gonna make a deal with you.
[02:10:12.724 --> 02:10:14.385]  I wanna purchase that vape juice.
[02:10:14.385 --> 02:10:14.706]  NO!
[02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:15.906]  If you sell it to me, I will!
[02:10:15.906 --> 02:10:16.367]  NO!
[02:10:16.367 --> 02:10:17.568]  IF YOU SELL IT TO ME, I WILL!
[02:10:17.568 --> 02:10:18.608]  GET THE F**K OUT!
[02:10:19.409 --> 02:10:22.432]  Look, if you sell it to me, I won't call the police.
[02:10:22.432 --> 02:10:23.973]  What you did was assaulted me.
[02:10:23.973 --> 02:10:26.055]  What I need is that for my wife.
[02:10:26.055 --> 02:10:30.739]  If you sell it to me, I won't call the f*****g cops and press charges on you for assault.
[02:10:30.739 --> 02:10:33.461]  I won't call corporate and get you fired.
[02:10:33.461 --> 02:10:36.303]  Just sell me the f*****g product so I can leave.
[02:10:36.303 --> 02:10:37.024]  What do you want?
[02:10:37.024 --> 02:10:40.727]  Naked in a, the strawberry in a f*****g 6 milligram.
[02:10:40.727 --> 02:10:41.628]  Where can you see naked?
[02:10:41.628 --> 02:10:41.928]  Right here.
[02:10:42.028 --> 02:10:42.848]  Here, this shit.
[02:10:42.848 --> 02:10:43.368]  Where is it?
[02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:44.229]  This?
[02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.789]  Right there.
[02:10:44.789 --> 02:10:45.309]  Here.
[02:10:45.309 --> 02:10:46.369]  Right next to that.
[02:10:46.369 --> 02:10:47.330]  In a six milligram.
[02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:50.331]  Make sure it's a six milligram so I don't have to come back.
[02:10:50.331 --> 02:10:52.991]  No, you're not f***ing coming back without a sword on me.
[02:10:52.991 --> 02:10:54.252]  I'm making sure of that.
[02:10:54.252 --> 02:10:55.332]  I love when he says, do my bidding.
[02:10:55.332 --> 02:10:56.012]  Get the f*** out of here, dude.
[02:10:56.012 --> 02:10:58.833]  Oh my f*** off.
[02:10:58.833 --> 02:10:59.934]  God bless America.
[02:10:59.934 --> 02:11:01.214]  Capitalism wins again.
[02:11:01.214 --> 02:11:02.835]  F*** your capitalism.
[02:11:02.835 --> 02:11:04.335]  F*** your f***ing president.
[02:11:04.335 --> 02:11:06.796]  He's a racist, stupid piece of s***.
[02:11:06.796 --> 02:11:09.257]  You're a racist, stupid piece of s***.
[02:11:09.257 --> 02:11:09.537]  F*** off.
[02:11:11.533 --> 02:11:14.315]  Do my bidding.
[02:11:14.315 --> 02:11:16.557]  Sell it to me.
[02:11:16.557 --> 02:11:18.139]  No, no, no.
[02:11:18.139 --> 02:11:21.422]  Sell it to me.
[02:11:21.422 --> 02:11:22.623]  It's your job, your freedom.
[02:11:22.623 --> 02:11:24.104]  Sell me the shit.
[02:11:24.104 --> 02:11:25.165]  Sell it to me.
[02:11:25.165 --> 02:11:27.247]  Sell it to me.
[02:11:27.247 --> 02:11:28.648]  Come on.
[02:11:28.648 --> 02:11:29.569]  Ring it up.
[02:11:29.569 --> 02:11:31.550]  Ring it up and you don't ruin your life.
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.691]  That's where you're at right now.
[02:11:32.691 --> 02:11:34.052]  Because you done upset me.
[02:11:34.873 --> 02:11:40.079]  And you should have helped him first in the first place before you threw a temper tantrum, dipshit!
[02:11:40.079 --> 02:11:42.561]  He's standing here waiting for you to ring him up.
[02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:44.744]  How f***ing- Get out!
[02:11:44.744 --> 02:11:45.705]  Help your customer!
[02:11:45.705 --> 02:11:46.165]  F*** off!
[02:11:46.165 --> 02:11:48.027]  F*** off!
[02:12:00.321 --> 02:12:04.103]  I'm cool with it.
[02:12:04.103 --> 02:12:04.624]  I'm recording.
[02:12:04.624 --> 02:12:11.609]  You got a business card for your manager or anything like that?
[02:12:11.609 --> 02:12:15.132]  Well I love how Ian Ferguson handles this giant toddler.
[02:12:15.132 --> 02:12:17.433]  Facebook.com forward slash Ian.Ferguson.
[02:12:17.433 --> 02:12:19.595]  Twitter at VapeshopPatriot.
[02:12:19.595 --> 02:12:20.876]  This is a great name.
[02:12:20.876 --> 02:12:21.797]  Thanks for coming on with us again.
[02:12:21.797 --> 02:12:22.517]  I know you're in a lodge.
[02:12:22.517 --> 02:12:24.499]  We'll just give you a few segments.
[02:12:24.499 --> 02:12:25.379]  Again, breakdown.
[02:12:26.986 --> 02:12:28.167]  Any key points you want to add?
[02:12:28.167 --> 02:12:32.810]  Because this is now part of the cultural iconography.
[02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:34.591]  Cultural iconography?
[02:12:34.591 --> 02:12:35.832]  Wow, that's heavy, Alex.
[02:12:35.832 --> 02:12:39.174]  I don't know.
[02:12:39.174 --> 02:12:40.955]  You pretty much covered it.
[02:12:40.955 --> 02:12:42.436]  The guy just went ballistic.
[02:12:42.436 --> 02:12:47.540]  And I really can't... I can't... And you gotta love Skype.
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:48.620]  As soon as we go to him, it breaks up.
[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:49.201]  We'll get it back on.
[02:12:49.991 --> 02:12:56.512]  When I say cultural iconography, this guy is now going to be like Age Skrillex with Owen Schroer discovering him.
[02:12:56.512 --> 02:12:58.312]  These guys are such ridiculous characters.
[02:12:58.312 --> 02:13:02.353]  He's called the Vapetard right now, but I don't think that's a good enough name.
[02:13:02.353 --> 02:13:08.714]  What do you think, Ian, his new... You, the one that discovered him, you should be able to give him the name.
[02:13:08.714 --> 02:13:10.795]  Like Paul named one girl Trigglypuff.
[02:13:10.795 --> 02:13:12.395]  What do you want to name him?
[02:13:12.395 --> 02:13:13.655]  Trigglypuff.
[02:13:13.655 --> 02:13:15.015]  Holy shit.
[02:13:15.015 --> 02:13:17.256]  I don't know.
[02:13:17.256 --> 02:13:18.716]  My favorite has to be Ginger Snapped.
[02:13:20.446 --> 02:13:21.788]  Has to be Ginger Snaps.
[02:13:21.788 --> 02:13:25.111]  That one tickled my funny bone.
[02:13:25.111 --> 02:13:30.816]  So he's now dubbed Ginger Snap.
[02:13:30.816 --> 02:13:36.541]  But really, you know, at the end of the day, Alex, I feel bad for the guy.
[02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:41.686]  The lack of emotional control led to... He's out of work now.
[02:13:41.686 --> 02:13:44.268]  And people all over the place trying to find out who he is.
[02:13:44.268 --> 02:13:46.450]  And even if I had his name, I wouldn't give it to y'all.
[02:13:47.196 --> 02:13:48.917]  And there's no point in tracking this boy down.
[02:13:48.917 --> 02:13:51.137]  He has already been humiliated by his own actions.
[02:13:51.137 --> 02:13:54.298]  Y'all leave him alone.
[02:13:54.298 --> 02:13:59.340]  Now, Alex, if you can't find him, you had talked yesterday about maybe getting us together, trying to, like, hash it out.
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:00.280]  I'm with that.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:00.901]  I like that.
[02:14:00.901 --> 02:14:07.763]  I would fly Gingersnap and you here to Austin and then make a whole little mini documentary, like, over a weekend.
[02:14:07.763 --> 02:14:11.804]  And you guys can, like, ride a little toy choo-choo train around Zilker Park together.
[02:14:11.804 --> 02:14:13.345]  Everything else.
[02:14:13.345 --> 02:14:14.045]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:15.445 --> 02:14:18.407]  Given the opportunity, I'd love to sit down and have a talk with him.
[02:14:18.407 --> 02:14:22.889]  I believe that if I can get your ear for just a couple minutes, I can get us eye-to-eye.
[02:14:22.889 --> 02:14:27.532]  You know, we can come to an understanding.
[02:14:27.532 --> 02:14:33.095]  Why do you think he flipped out on you so bad, just seeing a Trump ad?
[02:14:33.095 --> 02:14:35.556]  How about mainstream media programming?
[02:14:36.981 --> 02:14:54.196]  If you take a look at, what is it, the four majors, five majors, every one of them, what is it, two owners amongst the news agencies, along with paper and internet as well, the message that is put out to the populace in general is tailor-made.
[02:14:54.196 --> 02:14:59.841]  They control the feelings and thoughts of the masses through fake news.
[02:14:59.841 --> 02:15:00.522]  It is what it is.
[02:15:01.286 --> 02:15:10.170]  You watch one news agency over the others and you can see the drastic difference between the two.
[02:15:10.170 --> 02:15:18.674]  Then you go take a look online, you check out the conservative websites, you check out some of the liberal stuff, and the story that's put across is just completely different.
[02:15:18.674 --> 02:15:20.555]  Things that aren't even reported are.
[02:15:20.555 --> 02:15:26.438]  You know, I hear all of this about the wall and illegal immigration and detention camps.
[02:15:27.609 --> 02:15:40.752]  And I was talking to my extended family just the other night, Christmas Eve as a matter of fact, and blew their mind letting them know that the migrant caravan has over 50,000 people in it, and a small portion of that is women and children.
[02:15:40.752 --> 02:15:43.353]  She had no idea because the mainstream media doesn't.
[02:15:43.353 --> 02:15:44.433]  This is what I wanted to do.
[02:15:44.433 --> 02:15:46.113]  I wanted to hear who Ian Ferguson is.
[02:15:46.113 --> 02:15:46.813]  You're on a roll.
[02:15:46.813 --> 02:15:49.914]  You're going to host when we come back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:15:49.914 --> 02:15:53.575]  I want to hear your whole breakdown on where we're at straight ahead, and then phone calls, folks.
[02:15:53.575 --> 02:15:53.935]  Stay with us.

[02:16:55.017 --> 02:16:56.237]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.237 --> 02:17:00.158]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.158 --> 02:17:01.678]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.678 --> 02:17:04.639]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:10.200]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:11.400]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.340]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:16.561]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:21.001 --> 02:17:23.302]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[02:17:56.249 --> 02:17:58.993]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:17:58.993 --> 02:18:05.300]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.083]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:18:07.083 --> 02:18:13.651]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:18:13.851 --> 02:18:14.171]  I think so.
[02:18:31.578 --> 02:18:32.038]  I think so.
[02:18:56.206 --> 02:19:01.730]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:11.497]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:19:11.497 --> 02:19:19.583]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:19:20.558 --> 02:19:28.485]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:19:28.485 --> 02:19:31.608]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:19:31.608 --> 02:19:33.089]  It really is amazing.
[02:19:33.089 --> 02:19:39.795]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:19:39.795 --> 02:19:42.498]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:45.321]  Of Infowars.
[02:19:45.321 --> 02:19:46.621]  So please spread the links.
[02:19:46.621 --> 02:19:49.963]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[02:19:49.963 --> 02:19:53.285]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:19:53.285 --> 02:19:54.605]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:19:54.605 --> 02:19:58.768]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:19:58.768 --> 02:20:01.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.435 --> 02:20:12.078]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:12.078 --> 02:20:20.565]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:20.565 --> 02:20:27.632]  Our guest is with us for one more segment, then it's wall-to-wall calls and news after that, and then hosting the fourth hour.
[02:20:27.632 --> 02:20:28.713]  Going to have...
[02:20:30.418 --> 02:20:33.584]  One of the top censored comedians in the country joining us.
[02:20:33.584 --> 02:20:34.887]  I guess that's on Wednesday.
[02:20:34.887 --> 02:20:37.712]  Mike Adams is hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:20:37.712 --> 02:20:39.335]  Always informative, always powerful.
[02:20:39.335 --> 02:20:42.060]  He was on fire last Friday show.
[02:20:43.857 --> 02:20:45.298]  But you were on a roll.
[02:20:45.298 --> 02:20:49.982]  You were laying out your political views, talking to family that people aren't aware.
[02:20:49.982 --> 02:20:53.646]  They see the news, cropping photos showing a few women and a few children.
[02:20:53.646 --> 02:20:55.207]  And we say, why aren't they allowed in?
[02:20:55.207 --> 02:21:02.414]  And every network won't show you tens of thousands breaking across barriers, child trafficking, drug dealing.
[02:21:02.414 --> 02:21:04.996]  So start over where you were at, sir.
[02:21:09.247 --> 02:21:11.008]  The migrant caravan specifically?
[02:21:11.008 --> 02:21:16.590]  You were talking to extended family over the holidays, over Christmas, and they were just blown away.
[02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:20.773]  Yeah, look, come to find out the things that they don't know.
[02:21:20.773 --> 02:21:28.957]  And it led me to realize that that's the vast majority of the populace then.
[02:21:28.957 --> 02:21:32.179]  The media's blanket is, it covers everything.
[02:21:32.179 --> 02:21:33.459]  They get everybody.
[02:21:33.459 --> 02:21:36.221]  And they're controlling what is and isn't seen.
[02:21:37.904 --> 02:21:41.286]  So I realize that so many people just don't even know.
[02:21:41.286 --> 02:21:42.426]  They don't take the time to look.
[02:21:42.426 --> 02:21:43.587]  They're over it.
[02:21:43.587 --> 02:21:47.889]  The divide and the over-reporting of fake bullshit.
[02:21:47.889 --> 02:21:48.990]  Sorry, pardon my language.
[02:21:48.990 --> 02:21:50.271]  I will try not to do that.
[02:21:50.271 --> 02:21:51.631]  Yeah, we have to delay it when you cuss.
[02:21:51.631 --> 02:21:53.512]  But hey, Lindsey Graham cusses.
[02:21:53.512 --> 02:21:54.613]  Beto O'Rourke.
[02:21:54.613 --> 02:21:56.594]  Everybody gets to cuss on TV but me.
[02:21:56.594 --> 02:21:59.415]  So just, we're Infowars, so we're not allowed to.
[02:21:59.415 --> 02:22:02.117]  Everybody else is allowed to now, but conservatives aren't.
[02:22:02.117 --> 02:22:03.958]  But I guess Lindsey Graham is, so.
[02:22:03.958 --> 02:22:04.338]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:08.581]  Yeah, so I'm going to try and tone down the language.
[02:22:08.581 --> 02:22:10.022]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:10.022 --> 02:22:10.802]  We just talk however.
[02:22:10.802 --> 02:22:11.263]  No, it's okay.
[02:22:11.263 --> 02:22:11.883]  You're doing a great job.
[02:22:11.883 --> 02:22:12.203]  Go ahead.
[02:22:12.203 --> 02:22:14.204]  I don't know, where are we at?
[02:22:14.204 --> 02:22:15.425]  The under-reporting?
[02:22:15.425 --> 02:22:16.546]  Yes.
[02:22:16.546 --> 02:22:18.927]  I mean, look, okay, so here's where we're at in the world, right?
[02:22:18.927 --> 02:22:31.615]  We've got, just a couple years ago now, we had the sitting president pick his successor and then weaponize the DOJ, the IRS, Homeland Security, weaponize the government against the opponent.
[02:22:32.702 --> 02:22:35.084]  That's where we're at as a nation right now.
[02:22:35.084 --> 02:22:38.206]  We're coming out of that culture slowly.
[02:22:38.206 --> 02:22:45.091]  And you know, I know you like to go on and on and on about the Deep State and, you know, that stuff at Christmas where I was realizing that they just don't hear.
[02:22:45.091 --> 02:22:45.792]  They don't know.
[02:22:45.792 --> 02:22:47.873]  They're not interested.
[02:22:47.873 --> 02:22:54.098]  Even further than that, once you start talking about the Deep State and how there's a whole other shadow government trying to pull strings, they close their ears.
[02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:54.778]  It's not happening.
[02:22:54.778 --> 02:22:55.499]  They don't want to hear it.
[02:22:55.499 --> 02:23:02.064]  They want to believe that we're all racist, that we're all closet child molesters, pedophiles, that we're just monsters.
[02:23:03.658 --> 02:23:13.245]  That, because we have conservative views, that we're more moderate in tone, less guided by our feelings, than that we have no feelings at all.
[02:23:13.245 --> 02:23:16.367]  And that is so far from the truth.
[02:23:16.367 --> 02:23:18.969]  Although, that's well said.
[02:23:18.969 --> 02:23:20.570]  We're not as easy to manipulate.
[02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:22.071]  We know the game that's being played.
[02:23:22.071 --> 02:23:28.476]  And as you said about COG and all this, Obama, I remember when I knew the Democrats were beyond evil.
[02:23:28.476 --> 02:23:29.597]  It was like six years ago.
[02:23:30.939 --> 02:23:38.244]  Rachel Maddow goes, Republicans are filing lawsuits about the Tea Party having its tax exemption taken away and churches being audited.
[02:23:38.244 --> 02:23:39.465]  She goes, of course they are!
[02:23:39.465 --> 02:23:40.886]  You're racist!
[02:23:40.886 --> 02:23:46.010]  So they have the IRS persecuting people because they're Christian or because they're conservative.
[02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:49.193]  They're now trying to ban Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[02:23:49.933 --> 02:23:53.636]  And it's crazy that they're doing this.
[02:23:53.636 --> 02:23:55.838]  And like you said, they've totally weaponized it.
[02:23:55.838 --> 02:24:02.684]  So just like they did that to conservatives for eight years under Obama, when Trump got in, they just said, keep it going, keep it going.
[02:24:02.684 --> 02:24:04.406]  And then that's the crime.
[02:24:04.406 --> 02:24:05.947]  And then there's so many cowards in D.C.
[02:24:07.168 --> 02:24:09.809]  Trump's getting the orders to arrest all these people.
[02:24:09.809 --> 02:24:10.389]  You know what?
[02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:13.610]  No one will follow them because they're all cowards.
[02:24:13.610 --> 02:24:25.054]  I can't believe that if Trump had, and I'm not just bragging, it's true, a thousand people like you or me or Tucker Carlson or whatever or Sean Hannity, it'd be over because it's constitutional.
[02:24:25.054 --> 02:24:25.534]  It's true.
[02:24:25.534 --> 02:24:26.574]  We follow the order.
[02:24:26.574 --> 02:24:30.475]  He is surrounded by a bunch of damn double-dealing cowards.
[02:24:30.475 --> 02:24:32.496]  What does he do then, Ian Ferguson?
[02:24:35.084 --> 02:24:37.125]  I couldn't even speak to the mind of Trump.
[02:24:37.125 --> 02:24:42.309]  That guy's got a business acumen that goes way beyond where I'm at.
[02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:44.470]  He constantly surprises me with his next move.
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:47.201]  No, I know, but let's say he's a builder.
[02:24:47.201 --> 02:24:49.762]  He can't build a steel building without steel.
[02:24:49.762 --> 02:24:54.844]  And these people tell him they're steel, they're a bunch of aluminum or plastic.
[02:24:54.844 --> 02:24:58.545]  They're all a bunch of... The reservoir of D.C.
[02:24:58.545 --> 02:25:00.406]  is a bunch of yes-men and cowards.
[02:25:00.406 --> 02:25:01.806]  So, he's surrounded.
[02:25:01.806 --> 02:25:09.049]  It's been proven by a bunch of liars that tell him to his face, yes, sir, we'll do that, and they don't do a damn thing he says.
[02:25:09.049 --> 02:25:10.550]  Well, welcome to politics.
[02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:12.050]  I mean, it is what it is.
[02:25:12.050 --> 02:25:13.591]  You can't trust a politician, never could.
[02:25:15.029 --> 02:25:18.070]  And maybe that's why I like him so much, because he wasn't a politician.
[02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:19.330]  He still isn't.
[02:25:19.330 --> 02:25:26.211]  And I watch him fumble at times where a politician, somebody who was slick, slick mouth would have slid right through there.
[02:25:26.211 --> 02:25:28.311]  You know, slick Willie could have said it right.
[02:25:28.311 --> 02:25:30.712]  Obama could have orated his way through it.
[02:25:30.712 --> 02:25:36.673]  But Trump's just going to come through like a bull in a china shop, because like you said, you've got to be strong.
[02:25:36.673 --> 02:25:37.353]  Got to.
[02:25:37.353 --> 02:25:38.833]  And he's he's doing that for us.
[02:25:38.833 --> 02:25:41.054]  He puts on a strong front.
[02:25:41.054 --> 02:25:42.814]  You want somebody that's going to kowtow to
[02:25:44.332 --> 02:25:50.935]  Other foreign leaders, let them dictate our policy, how we spend our money, or how we take care of our people?
[02:25:50.935 --> 02:25:57.058]  No, I want somebody that's going to stand up there and run right through them.
[02:25:57.058 --> 02:26:01.780]  I wanted to say his phrase, but I don't know if I'm going to get edited over that either.
[02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:03.241]  You've got to stand up.
[02:26:03.241 --> 02:26:05.742]  We need a leader that's going to stand up, and we finally got one.
[02:26:07.308 --> 02:26:14.014]  And this, uh, I don't know, this blanket they've cast over the media, they have done a great job brainwashing.
[02:26:14.014 --> 02:26:15.755]  Oh, everything he does, they say the opposite.
[02:26:15.755 --> 02:26:22.481]  We can delay this for TV and radio, but since Lindsey Graham gets to say cuss words on CNN, why can't you and everybody else does?
[02:26:22.481 --> 02:26:27.606]  But we're going to delay it for stations, but I don't want to censor you, so go ahead and say your phrase.
[02:26:27.606 --> 02:26:27.866]  Right.
[02:26:28.872 --> 02:26:30.494]  Trump said it best, grab them by the pussy.
[02:26:30.494 --> 02:26:34.337]  I want a leader that's going to stand up and do what needs to be done.
[02:26:34.337 --> 02:26:41.925]  Take the hard hits, say the wrong thing, make them cry a little bit, shake them down to their core, and then get what you need out of the deal.
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.221]  No, it's true.
[02:26:46.221 --> 02:27:03.350]  They've gotten America to be a bunch of wimps so we can be run over by the chi-coms and everybody else, and Trump's just saying, listen, the gang-raping of America's over, and that's why I can't believe more people don't get behind him, when it's so obvious that he had control for two years, barely, the economy turned around, now they're killing it, they admit to hurt him!
[02:27:03.350 --> 02:27:04.711]  People should be angry!
[02:27:04.711 --> 02:27:06.652]  They should be.
[02:27:06.652 --> 02:27:07.613]  Well, they are.
[02:27:07.613 --> 02:27:09.954]  No, no, no, they are, but you're talking about the wrong group.
[02:27:10.874 --> 02:27:12.275]  Well, both groups are angry, all right?
[02:27:12.275 --> 02:27:13.795]  Be legitimate about it.
[02:27:13.795 --> 02:27:17.356]  Red, blue, everybody's pissed off for separate reasons.
[02:27:17.356 --> 02:27:26.660]  You know, the red group, they're pissed because, look, we're getting painted as racists, monsters, child molesters, racists.
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:27.540]  We hate everybody.
[02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:28.660]  We don't have any feelings.
[02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:33.622]  The blue group's pissed because they were raised where everybody gets a trophy and their candidate lost.
[02:27:34.893 --> 02:27:40.117]  No, I agree, and listen, I'm not for violence like the left is, but I'm also not for rolling over.
[02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:48.623]  And so, it's time to get back in their face, and I do it every day when they get in my face, and you're doing it, and I'm doing it, and we're done.
[02:27:48.623 --> 02:27:55.948]  These little brats that would wreck this country in a minute, that literally hate it, need to learn, we're not going anywhere.
[02:27:55.948 --> 02:27:57.149]  And I think they figured that out.
[02:27:57.149 --> 02:27:59.250]  I think we're going to outlast them long term.
[02:27:59.250 --> 02:28:00.371]  What do you think, Ian Ferguson?
[02:28:01.596 --> 02:28:05.738]  More than anything, I think people need to sit down and have a conversation about it.
[02:28:05.738 --> 02:28:11.881]  You know, I spent a lot of my life getting in people's faces, and it led me to no good place.
[02:28:11.881 --> 02:28:15.422]  And sometimes the thing that's necessary is to sit down and see eye to eye.
[02:28:15.422 --> 02:28:17.723]  You know, hash it out, speak about it.
[02:28:17.723 --> 02:28:21.505]  No, I would love to be able to hash it out with them, but they get in my face.
[02:28:21.505 --> 02:28:22.145]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:22.145 --> 02:28:25.647]  And look, when somebody gets in your face, you put them on their ass.
[02:28:25.647 --> 02:28:27.308]  Within arm's reach is a threat.
[02:28:27.308 --> 02:28:28.648]  Stay outside of it.
[02:28:28.648 --> 02:28:29.029]  We can talk.
[02:28:30.876 --> 02:28:32.718]  Well, I gotta tell you, pop back in with us.
[02:28:32.718 --> 02:28:34.801]  I want to talk about you doing some reports for us.
[02:28:34.801 --> 02:28:37.424]  We should think of some ideas and do that more.
[02:28:37.424 --> 02:28:46.675]  And we'll be talking soon, but good job keeping your cool, like you said, with that ginger snap, lebtard, the lebtard, the vape head.
[02:28:46.675 --> 02:28:48.517]  And so we'll be following what you do, my friend.
[02:28:48.517 --> 02:28:51.100]  Ian Ferguson, have a good week and a new year, my friend.
[02:28:55.109 --> 02:29:01.453]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:29:01.453 --> 02:29:04.495]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:29:04.495 --> 02:29:10.419]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:29:10.419 --> 02:29:14.202]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:29:14.202 --> 02:29:15.483]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:29:15.483 --> 02:29:16.824]  Who do we fight for?
[02:29:16.824 --> 02:29:23.028]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:29:23.028 --> 02:29:24.449]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:29:25.149 --> 02:29:28.091]  At WolfHillAmmo.com, we love shotguns.
[02:29:28.091 --> 02:29:33.954]  We offer the best specialty shotgun ammo on the market, including our defensive combo packs for home and retreat.

[02:29:53.225 --> 02:29:54.586]  WolfHillAmmo.com
[02:29:56.311 --> 02:30:01.834]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:30:01.834 --> 02:30:11.598]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:30:11.598 --> 02:30:19.682]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:30:20.677 --> 02:30:28.605]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:30:28.605 --> 02:30:31.708]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:30:31.708 --> 02:30:33.210]  It really is amazing.
[02:30:33.210 --> 02:30:39.917]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:30:39.917 --> 02:30:42.600]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:30:43.803 --> 02:30:46.664]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:30:46.664 --> 02:30:51.987]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:30:51.987 --> 02:30:58.350]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to support your child's development.
[02:31:13.157 --> 02:31:22.807]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:30.075]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA.
[02:31:30.956 --> 02:31:34.800]  Which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:44.651]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[02:31:44.651 --> 02:31:48.975]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[02:31:48.975 --> 02:31:53.159]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:56.058 --> 02:32:01.221]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:32:01.221 --> 02:32:03.162]  That's the globalist only hope.
[02:32:03.162 --> 02:32:22.374]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[02:32:22.634 --> 02:32:28.880]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:34.525]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[02:32:34.525 --> 02:32:37.027]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:32:37.027 --> 02:32:38.148]  Every order gets free shipping.
[02:32:38.148 --> 02:32:42.072]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding
[02:32:42.532 --> 02:32:50.260]  Allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:50.961]  We're on the march.
[02:32:50.961 --> 02:32:52.242]  The empire's on the run.
[02:32:52.242 --> 02:32:53.183]  I salute you all.
[02:32:53.183 --> 02:32:59.770]  Now, please take action at m4store.com.
[02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:02.413]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:12.700]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:12.700 --> 02:33:17.832]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:48.375 --> 02:33:50.236]  Alright, now you guys have been really great.
[02:33:50.236 --> 02:33:56.978]  We have over 20 phone lines, so I got to like 10 calls earlier, but then you let all the lines be open, then people got to hold for an hour, so I apologize.
[02:33:56.978 --> 02:34:06.480]  We're going to get to Caleb, who's been home the longest, and Jacob, and then Justin, and then Eric, and then right down the line to Craig and everybody else.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.921]  I'm going to everybody right now.
[02:34:07.921 --> 02:34:11.722]  There's a story up on InfoWars.com that's crazy.
[02:34:13.447 --> 02:34:15.428]  We don't just have NPR here in Austin.
[02:34:15.428 --> 02:34:17.508]  We don't just have UT Student Radio.
[02:34:17.508 --> 02:34:20.229]  They have another one that's basically government run.
[02:34:20.229 --> 02:34:26.131]  And it's not student, it's a co-op.
[02:34:26.131 --> 02:34:31.153]  And over the holidays, it's been airing demonic baby sacrifice music.
[02:34:31.153 --> 02:34:32.093]  I'm not kidding.
[02:34:32.093 --> 02:34:33.513]  We recorded it.
[02:34:33.513 --> 02:34:35.094]  This is what's been going on.
[02:34:35.094 --> 02:34:36.294]  Is this Christmas music?
[02:34:36.294 --> 02:34:38.695]  Austin radio station airs demonic sounds for hours.
[02:34:39.841 --> 02:34:40.942]  Hey Alex, I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:34:40.942 --> 02:34:41.322]  First time caller.
[02:35:09.176 --> 02:35:26.555]  I just want to get right to it and the part there's two dimensions to the info war one is inform and the other is inspire and you are obviously the master at information you're the general in the war you've done the most work I really think what what we need to do is
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:30.743]  In 2019, and this is the secret, is more inspiration.
[02:35:30.743 --> 02:35:34.647]  People are tired of both sides arguing and pointing out things.
[02:35:34.647 --> 02:35:37.329]  Oh, look, he said this, and look, he said that.
[02:35:37.329 --> 02:35:39.291]  Jacob, let me stop you, and I'm going to go right back to you.
[02:35:39.291 --> 02:35:42.213]  I was in the shower at 5.30 this morning.
[02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:48.681]  And I said, Alex, you read the news, you get obsessed with it, you never cover your inspiration.
[02:35:48.681 --> 02:35:57.183]  You must go on air and say your 2019 New Year's resolution is to be positive and inspirational.
[02:35:57.183 --> 02:36:02.504]  I even said this some last week about what is good so we know what we're fighting for.
[02:36:02.504 --> 02:36:03.424]  And I didn't do it.
[02:36:03.424 --> 02:36:07.365]  But you called in, which shows that that's the zeitgeist.
[02:36:07.365 --> 02:36:08.605]  You have my commitment.
[02:36:09.105 --> 02:36:15.031]  Jacob, that we are going to focus on the amazing and the positive at least half the time.
[02:36:15.031 --> 02:36:18.394]  For every negative thing we cover, we're going to cover something positive.
[02:36:18.394 --> 02:36:19.495]  Go ahead.
[02:36:19.495 --> 02:36:20.175]  Exactly.
[02:36:20.175 --> 02:36:23.899]  And that's the key, is now we have to create our own narrative.
[02:36:23.899 --> 02:36:26.922]  We have to brainwash and chant it like a mantra.
[02:36:26.922 --> 02:36:31.326]  And the mantra is the future, each other, the future.
[02:36:31.326 --> 02:36:34.829]  Keep chanting it like a mantra until it programs the people.
[02:36:35.407 --> 02:36:37.388]  Literally, that is what we need.
[02:36:37.388 --> 02:36:45.894]  And it's like, we have the technology right now to 3D print houses out of hemp concrete using robots to do it all autonomously.
[02:36:45.894 --> 02:36:50.397]  Why are we not building this future, this better future together as friends?
[02:36:50.397 --> 02:36:51.438]  We're all connected.
[02:36:51.438 --> 02:36:55.420]  We all have a cell phone in our hand that connects us around the world.
[02:36:55.420 --> 02:37:00.544]  Why isn't our government just an iPhone app that we just pull up and say, okay, I want to vote for him.
[02:37:01.875 --> 02:37:12.039]  No, you're right, because it's a bunch of control freaks, even top scientists, geopolitical scientists have admitted that we have a ruling global elite that stir up problems so they're needed.
[02:37:12.039 --> 02:37:16.301]  Instead of just get out of the way, then there'll be unlimited resources, which is true!
[02:37:16.301 --> 02:37:25.585]  We are at the point of unlimited resources, and the globalists are working around the clock to suppress all the real technologies that would bring us that.
[02:37:25.585 --> 02:37:26.165]  Exactly.
[02:37:26.165 --> 02:37:28.186]  So quit talking about their narrative.
[02:37:28.186 --> 02:37:30.847]  You and Drudge keep pulling up what they're saying.
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:31.960]  Ignore them.
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:35.282]  The easiest way to make a bully quit bullying you is ignore him.
[02:37:35.282 --> 02:37:36.242]  Don't fight back.
[02:37:36.242 --> 02:37:37.963]  Just be like, you don't exist.
[02:37:37.963 --> 02:37:41.845]  Your ideas... Well, I think there's a balance to both of it, because you've got to have intel on what they're doing.
[02:37:41.845 --> 02:37:44.266]  But I've been seeing that all over the comments on InfoWars.
[02:37:44.266 --> 02:37:54.611]  People are like, Alex, don't spend a segment and a half on Young Turks lying about you saying you're a... Because the Young Turks go on air and go, Jones admits he's fake.
[02:37:55.151 --> 02:38:00.379]  Jones admits everything he said is a lie, and then they don't show where I said it, so I get mad and say they're liars.
[02:38:00.379 --> 02:38:03.163]  But people go, Alex, we know they're liars.
[02:38:03.163 --> 02:38:04.765]  You don't need to defend yourself.
[02:38:04.765 --> 02:38:11.475]  And I guess that's why they attack me and lie about me constantly, is so that I'll be defending myself instead of just getting the news out.
[02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:18.533]  Yeah, and trust me, we all love you, and the reason you're so successful is because the whole world just needs a daddy.
[02:38:18.533 --> 02:38:19.694]  They need a coach.
[02:38:19.694 --> 02:38:27.217]  They need a strong male voice to tell them, quit being a bitch, suck it up, get up, and let's work together, and let's do a good job.
[02:38:27.217 --> 02:38:30.579]  And you're good, you have the voice for it, but yes, you do get
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:46.526]  Well, I agree we gotta fight them and we gotta resist them, but we do have to understand while we're doing that, that there's a beautiful world and so much good and not give them so much power.
[02:38:46.526 --> 02:38:47.146]  You know what?
[02:38:47.146 --> 02:38:47.587]  God bless you.
[02:38:47.587 --> 02:38:48.427]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:48.427 --> 02:38:50.068]  Please call back again, Jacob.
[02:38:50.068 --> 02:38:51.068]  I've told the crew this.
[02:38:51.068 --> 02:38:56.691]  I got so upset during the midterms that it was my job to come up with the information, which we had.
[02:38:57.831 --> 02:38:59.153]  To get it out there.
[02:38:59.153 --> 02:39:00.834]  I wasn't worried about being censored ourselves.
[02:39:00.834 --> 02:39:04.739]  I knew that I've been taken out of the game partially because they knew that we had the answer.
[02:39:04.739 --> 02:39:05.880]  So I was thinking, what is it?
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:06.340]  What is it?
[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:07.221]  What is it?
[02:39:07.221 --> 02:39:09.484]  You know, what do I do with what they're doing?
[02:39:09.484 --> 02:39:11.586]  You know, what do I expose?
[02:39:11.586 --> 02:39:12.988]  How do I expose it to beat them?
[02:39:12.988 --> 02:39:15.891]  Like I had to beat it and I got totally upset.
[02:39:15.891 --> 02:39:17.192]  I never get demoralized and depressed.
[02:39:17.192 --> 02:39:19.515]  I got depressed and I was being a jerk to the crew.
[02:39:20.947 --> 02:39:24.848]  And then when we lost the midterms because of fraud, I realized it's all a process.
[02:39:24.848 --> 02:39:26.388]  We're winning all over the world.
[02:39:26.388 --> 02:39:28.328]  And so I've been in a lot better mood since then.
[02:39:28.328 --> 02:39:29.088]  It's true.
[02:39:29.088 --> 02:39:30.869]  They win if we have a heart attack.
[02:39:30.869 --> 02:39:32.269]  They got David Knight really down, man.
[02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:34.549]  He's been really upset about the country.
[02:39:34.549 --> 02:39:35.369]  He really cares.
[02:39:35.369 --> 02:39:38.430]  And I was giving him a pep talk last week before he had that big heart attack.
[02:39:38.430 --> 02:39:39.770]  And I was like, dude, take some time off it.
[02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:42.591]  He was just, he wasn't worried about himself being censored.
[02:39:42.591 --> 02:39:43.651]  He's a smart guy.
[02:39:43.651 --> 02:39:46.271]  He, you know, he's been around the world, done a lot of stuff.
[02:39:46.271 --> 02:39:48.452]  He was really, and it's normal.
[02:39:48.452 --> 02:39:49.732]  You get upset by this.
[02:39:50.976 --> 02:39:54.757]  It's like Nietzsche said, you can't stare into the abyss and become it.
[02:39:54.757 --> 02:39:59.459]  You've got to look at it, know what it is, and then fight it, but be of good cheer.
[02:39:59.459 --> 02:40:07.142]  You're absolutely right, because there's no doubt I'm going to end up having a heart attack and die by the time I'm 55 or something if I keep this up, because I genuinely get pissed.
[02:40:07.742 --> 02:40:09.023]  I mean, you know, it's not an act.
[02:40:09.023 --> 02:40:12.026]  And it's embarrassing, you know, to get this mad.
[02:40:12.026 --> 02:40:16.650]  So I had Libtards confront me this weekend, and I just basically said, well, God bless you, thank you.
[02:40:16.650 --> 02:40:21.274]  Instead of giving them power, I just saw them as the dumb victims they are, instead of blowing up at them.
[02:40:21.274 --> 02:40:23.696]  And you're absolutely right, and your advice is well taken.
[02:40:25.583 --> 02:40:27.124]  Let's cover some Hollywood pedophile ranks.
[02:40:27.124 --> 02:40:30.467]  At the same time, we've got to cover these people.
[02:40:30.467 --> 02:40:32.869]  What, you think I'm not sick of talking about them?
[02:40:32.869 --> 02:40:38.514]  If there was some free country that wasn't run by a bunch of damn devil worshippers, I'd be leaving right now!
[02:40:38.514 --> 02:40:39.494]  There's nowhere to go!
[02:40:39.494 --> 02:40:43.458]  So see, I say you're right, then I start getting angry.
[02:40:43.458 --> 02:40:50.023]  It's a balance, and that's why we've got to ask God into our lives every day, and just the calming
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:52.521]  Sometimes I can't sleep at night.
[02:40:52.521 --> 02:40:53.962]  I get so angry about this.
[02:40:53.962 --> 02:40:58.305]  I have to pray and ask God to make me calm and then that's when I can go to sleep.
[02:40:58.305 --> 02:41:00.006]  And I just hear kind of like waves hitting the beach.
[02:41:00.006 --> 02:41:01.247]  It's like, it's all right.
[02:41:01.247 --> 02:41:02.168]  It's all part of the plan.
[02:41:02.168 --> 02:41:03.769]  Everything's going to be okay.
[02:41:03.769 --> 02:41:05.971]  But I think about people that don't care.
[02:41:05.971 --> 02:41:08.793]  I don't want to be them though.
[02:41:08.793 --> 02:41:11.635]  Like people that just don't care or they enjoy being evil.
[02:41:11.635 --> 02:41:13.897]  Can you imagine being them?
[02:41:13.897 --> 02:41:14.057]  I mean...
[02:41:15.842 --> 02:41:17.502]  It's all food for thought.
[02:41:17.502 --> 02:41:25.944]  That's a whole other subject for a long debate on the show with callers about, isn't it positive to cover bad things that are happening because you believe people will change it?
[02:41:25.944 --> 02:41:29.504]  The establishment always goes, no, you're just demoralizing people with the bad news.
[02:41:29.504 --> 02:41:30.345]  Well, is that true?
[02:41:30.345 --> 02:41:39.746]  Because I always thought if something bad's happening, like if my neighbor's house is getting broken into, I'm going to go over and, you know, call the police.
[02:41:39.746 --> 02:41:43.927]  I'm going to put a deer rifle bead on them in case they, you know,
[02:41:45.202 --> 02:41:47.424]  I'm not trying to hurt anybody.
[02:41:47.424 --> 02:41:49.906]  And that's a positive thing that I'm going to take action.
[02:41:49.906 --> 02:41:51.627]  It's not a negative thing.
[02:41:51.627 --> 02:41:52.748]  But I'm pontificating.
[02:41:52.748 --> 02:41:54.169]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:41:54.169 --> 02:41:56.051]  I took one call in that segment.
[02:41:56.051 --> 02:41:58.733]  This caller was a good caller.
[02:41:58.733 --> 02:42:00.094]  But I just didn't do it again.
[02:42:00.094 --> 02:42:04.297]  Mike Adams is coming up, but he's cool to be pushed back one way or another.
[02:42:04.297 --> 02:42:05.158]  I'm going to Caleb.
[02:42:05.158 --> 02:42:05.998]  I'm going to Justin.
[02:42:05.998 --> 02:42:07.280]  I'm going to Eric.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:08.621]  I'm going to Craig.
[02:42:08.621 --> 02:42:12.584]  I'm going to DeRay, Janice, Lee, James, and Parker.
[02:42:13.851 --> 02:42:15.872]  Probably take me 15 minutes to the next hour, but I'm gonna do it.
[02:42:15.872 --> 02:42:19.094]  So I'm gonna overbook guests, overbook calls.
[02:42:19.094 --> 02:42:22.457]  I don't even do one thing that's very critical, and that's plug.
[02:42:22.457 --> 02:42:25.078]  Folks, you've really come through in the last year, despite all the attacks.
[02:42:25.078 --> 02:42:29.461]  You have provided for us, you have bought the products and gotten great products at the same time.
[02:42:29.461 --> 02:42:30.582]  You've done it.
[02:42:30.582 --> 02:42:42.910]  And this is the last chance, because we're about to sell out and have sold out a lot of great products, but we have store-wide free shipping, 50-75% off, double Patriot points for your next order, and a free gift in every order, and it's a year-end special, so
[02:42:43.690 --> 02:42:44.431]  It should end tomorrow.
[02:42:44.431 --> 02:42:47.733]  It should end today, but I haven't done the new specials yet.
[02:42:47.733 --> 02:42:49.875]  But it's gonna end in the next few days.
[02:42:49.875 --> 02:42:52.517]  So thanks for your support, but get in there and get some more products.
[02:42:52.517 --> 02:42:52.837]  Thank you.
[02:42:52.837 --> 02:42:55.339]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:55.339 --> 02:43:00.863]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:43:00.863 --> 02:43:09.370]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:43:10.629 --> 02:43:18.718]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:43:19.701 --> 02:43:27.624]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:43:27.624 --> 02:43:30.745]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:43:30.745 --> 02:43:32.226]  It really is amazing.
[02:43:32.226 --> 02:43:38.929]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:41.610]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:44.452]  Of InfoWars.
[02:43:44.452 --> 02:43:45.754]  So please spread the links.
[02:43:45.754 --> 02:43:49.119]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:52.424]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:43:52.424 --> 02:43:53.746]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:43:53.746 --> 02:43:54.868]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:43:55.356 --> 02:44:02.839]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.
[02:44:02.839 --> 02:44:12.082]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[02:44:12.082 --> 02:44:21.166]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:44:22.117 --> 02:44:33.569]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[02:44:33.569 --> 02:44:37.033]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[02:44:37.253 --> 02:44:43.116]  We're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:44:43.116 --> 02:44:45.858]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[02:44:45.858 --> 02:44:49.519]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:44:49.519 --> 02:44:51.981]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:56.249 --> 02:45:01.410]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:45:01.410 --> 02:45:03.351]  That's the globalist only hope.
[02:45:03.351 --> 02:45:22.556]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars and free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America to stand against these individuals.
[02:45:22.816 --> 02:45:29.081]  When you order products at InfoWareStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[02:45:29.081 --> 02:45:34.725]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a total store clearance.
[02:45:34.725 --> 02:45:37.227]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:45:37.227 --> 02:45:38.348]  Every order gets free shipping.
[02:45:38.348 --> 02:45:42.251]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding
[02:45:42.731 --> 02:45:48.562]  Allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year.
[02:45:48.562 --> 02:45:50.465]  To not just fight, but to expand.
[02:45:50.465 --> 02:45:51.166]  We're on the march.
[02:45:51.166 --> 02:45:52.148]  The empire's on the run.
[02:45:52.148 --> 02:45:53.410]  I salute you all.
[02:45:53.410 --> 02:45:54.913]  Now please take action at m4store.com.
[02:45:56.579 --> 02:46:00.821]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:46:00.821 --> 02:46:04.283]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:46:04.283 --> 02:46:06.064]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:46:06.064 --> 02:46:09.326]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:46:09.326 --> 02:46:16.110]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:21.193]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:46:21.533 --> 02:46:27.636]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:27.636 --> 02:46:30.618]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:46:30.618 --> 02:46:31.719]  I want to keep going.
[02:46:31.719 --> 02:46:35.541]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:46:35.541 --> 02:46:37.562]  I want to push all the way.
[02:46:37.562 --> 02:46:38.863]  I've committed to do that.
[02:46:38.863 --> 02:46:39.923]  I've prayed for that.
[02:46:39.923 --> 02:46:41.584]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:46:41.584 --> 02:46:44.006]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:46:44.506 --> 02:46:45.627]  I will never falter.
[02:46:45.627 --> 02:46:48.148]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:46:48.148 --> 02:46:49.108]  I physically will.
[02:46:49.108 --> 02:46:59.193]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWarshow.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:46:59.193 --> 02:47:01.814]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.304 --> 02:47:28.633]  You know, I was thinking a month ago, I talked about this.
[02:47:28.633 --> 02:47:34.439]  How Sundar Pichairi is a total scapegoat for Larry Page.
[02:47:34.439 --> 02:47:38.183]  And now, the Wall Street Journal is reporting on that.
[02:47:38.183 --> 02:47:41.546]  Oh, Larry Page has been making deals with the CHICOM and selling the country out!
[02:47:43.368 --> 02:47:48.391]  And he doesn't want to go to prison if it doesn't go the way he thinks it's going to go.
[02:47:48.391 --> 02:47:53.134]  Alright, let's go right back to your phone calls here.
[02:47:53.134 --> 02:47:56.716]  Who's been holding them longer?
[02:47:56.716 --> 02:47:58.718]  Let's go ahead and talk to Justin in Georgia.
[02:47:58.718 --> 02:48:00.099]  Justin, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:48:00.099 --> 02:48:00.379]  Go ahead.
[02:48:01.997 --> 02:48:02.597]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:02.597 --> 02:48:06.119]  God bless you and God bless everybody that's part of the InfoWars.
[02:48:06.119 --> 02:48:08.700]  If it wasn't for that, we'd be in a real big mess.
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:09.960]  Well, that's what's scary.
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.081]  I mean, we're not bragging.
[02:48:11.081 --> 02:48:11.761]  You're not bragging.
[02:48:11.761 --> 02:48:13.802]  The listeners, the audience, are InfoWars.
[02:48:13.802 --> 02:48:17.904]  If it wasn't for us, if it wasn't for you, imagine how bad it'd be right now.
[02:48:17.904 --> 02:48:18.444]  Seriously.
[02:48:18.444 --> 02:48:19.764]  And that's not like a power trip.
[02:48:19.764 --> 02:48:21.925]  That's scary as hell.
[02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:22.426]  That's right.
[02:48:22.426 --> 02:48:25.967]  And here's one of my ideas about why it is so bad.
[02:48:25.967 --> 02:48:27.008]  It may be overlooked.
[02:48:27.008 --> 02:48:27.988]  I believe part of the
[02:48:28.533 --> 02:48:36.407]  The reason the liberal brain is the way it is is due to all the pharmaceutical poisons being pushed by the FDA and all those agencies like that that
[02:48:36.929 --> 02:48:42.190]  Just pump poisons into people, and it takes your morals and your soul away from you.
[02:48:42.190 --> 02:48:43.571]  And you're just a zombie.
[02:48:43.571 --> 02:48:48.312]  Well, the Bible says it, that those that take pharmakia become possessed.
[02:48:48.312 --> 02:48:55.394]  And I've been around enough people that take prescription drugs that are crazier than anybody I ever knew that was on illegal drugs.
[02:48:55.394 --> 02:48:57.014]  And it's true.
[02:48:57.014 --> 02:48:59.095]  We all know what nice guys can do when they're drunk.
[02:48:59.095 --> 02:49:02.936]  Well, take that ten times worse, and you're right, the average leftist
[02:49:03.826 --> 02:49:19.793]  It's something like four times more likely to be on a psychotropic, and the psychotropic insert says delusions of grandeur, mania, depression, suicidal tendencies, violent outbursts, psychosis, psychotic activity.
[02:49:19.793 --> 02:49:24.655]  I mean, these damn pills will make you crazier than a you-know-what.
[02:49:24.655 --> 02:49:25.315]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:25.315 --> 02:49:25.896]  Sure will.
[02:49:25.896 --> 02:49:31.438]  And then when you see them going after things that are natural, like kratom and CBD and marijuana,
[02:49:32.217 --> 02:49:33.178]  Absolutely right, sir.
[02:49:55.609 --> 02:50:03.658]  I mean, so many jobs are going to be opened up because of this, but the FDA is going to be in his way and he better get a hold of them.
[02:50:03.658 --> 02:50:05.300]  Well, you notice what you're saying is totally true.
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:10.986]  He's against deadly stuff like opium and synthetic things because he knows it's done a lot of bad.
[02:50:10.986 --> 02:50:16.332]  But then he looks at industrial hemp that everybody else has that's better than cotton, and he signed that bill and signed an order.
[02:50:16.852 --> 02:50:22.214]  And he's giving it back to the states, something Obama said he would do but didn't do, to decriminalize marijuana.
[02:50:22.214 --> 02:50:28.256]  And he's trying to fix the criminal justice system for nonviolent offenders.
[02:50:28.256 --> 02:50:34.437]  He's trying to pull out of these wars everything the Democrats said they'd kill for, but now they're against it!
[02:50:34.437 --> 02:50:37.018]  No appreciation of legalizing hemp.
[02:50:37.018 --> 02:50:39.839]  No appreciation of decriminalizing marijuana.
[02:50:39.839 --> 02:50:43.600]  No appreciation of trying to end these wars.
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:45.861]  No appreciation of lowest black unemployment ever.
[02:50:46.261 --> 02:50:50.885]  No appreciation of getting factories built in all these poor areas, black, white, you name it.
[02:50:50.885 --> 02:50:51.805]  No appreciation.
[02:50:51.805 --> 02:50:55.988]  And that's why they're so scared of Trump, because Trump is for real.
[02:50:55.988 --> 02:50:56.669]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:56.669 --> 02:51:10.939]  And some other things that I would suggest is he audit and end the Federal Reserve, the private banking cartel, the creature from Jekyll Island that was created a year after the Titanic sank with most of the people that were the richest people opposed to it.
[02:51:10.939 --> 02:51:13.741]  Oh, there's no doubt they blew that boat to kill those people.
[02:51:13.741 --> 02:51:14.222]  That's a fact.
[02:51:17.142 --> 02:51:19.323]  That's right, they report it wasn't just hitting that iceberg.
[02:51:19.323 --> 02:51:21.123]  The whole thing was a setup.
[02:51:21.123 --> 02:51:22.064]  All right, God bless you.
[02:51:22.064 --> 02:51:24.264]  Great points, my friend.
[02:51:24.264 --> 02:51:26.585]  Here's the bottom line for the New Year.
[02:51:26.585 --> 02:51:29.526]  Trump better go into full war mode or he's done and so are we.
[02:51:29.526 --> 02:51:30.207]  And he's doing it.
[02:51:30.207 --> 02:51:32.027]  He's getting rid of all these traitors.
[02:51:32.027 --> 02:51:33.528]  He's not listening to them.
[02:51:33.528 --> 02:51:36.189]  The media is like, oh my gosh, he's going with his gut.
[02:51:36.189 --> 02:51:37.249]  We're in danger.
[02:51:37.249 --> 02:51:39.930]  Colbert's like, good, go with your gut, it'll destroy you.
[02:51:39.930 --> 02:51:41.370]  Colbert's the guy that said he'd never be president.
[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:45.662]  You know, Trump gets it, though.
[02:51:45.662 --> 02:51:50.167]  Doing the right thing is what God wants to see, no matter what the outcome is.
[02:51:50.167 --> 02:51:53.791]  It's about decisions we make, not even outcomes.
[02:51:53.791 --> 02:51:56.934]  And the more dialed in you get, the more you realize that.
[02:51:56.934 --> 02:52:01.279]  And when you make the right decision, then things almost always seem to go your way.
[02:52:01.279 --> 02:52:03.541]  But you've got to do it for the right reason.
[02:52:04.522 --> 02:52:07.765]  And the media spins this that I'm fatalistic or I have this death wish.
[02:52:07.765 --> 02:52:11.228]  When I say I'm ready to die, I feel closer to God than ever.
[02:52:11.228 --> 02:52:17.953]  I added that I don't want to die, but that I'm confident.
[02:52:17.953 --> 02:52:19.815]  And I'm ready to die if I need to.
[02:52:19.815 --> 02:52:20.535]  And I don't just say that.
[02:52:20.535 --> 02:52:22.657]  I mean, I'm really ready.
[02:52:22.657 --> 02:52:25.920]  They can put a gun to my head and say, renounce what you say.
[02:52:25.920 --> 02:52:28.722]  And I'm just, no.
[02:52:28.722 --> 02:52:31.124]  It's a really good feeling.
[02:52:31.124 --> 02:52:32.626]  And you really start living at that point.
[02:52:33.582 --> 02:52:56.273]  And I look at all these other so-called men out there who go along with the system, but it's because they're not school teachers, they're not auto mechanics, they're not firefighters, they're not truck drivers, they're not machinists, they're not whoever they are, doing their own independent life in their own system.
[02:52:56.273 --> 02:53:00.795]  They went through systems where if you don't do what you're told, you don't go up the chain of command.
[02:53:01.997 --> 02:53:03.778]  And so we wonder why we're in so much trouble.
[02:53:03.778 --> 02:53:06.239]  It's this centralized, top-down thing.
[02:53:06.239 --> 02:53:08.840]  Trump came from his own place.
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:14.943]  His dad was an anti-globalist insider in the Liberty Movement, but not an insider in the establishment.
[02:53:14.943 --> 02:53:17.544]  And so I know why they're so scared of Trump.
[02:53:17.544 --> 02:53:22.766]  His lawyer and his confidant for 25 years was Roy Cohn.
[02:53:24.201 --> 02:53:32.847]  The brains behind trying to stop the Communist takeover of the U.S., who they demonize and call the worst man ever, and once he was dying of cancer, they disbarred him.
[02:53:32.847 --> 02:53:35.509]  Roy Cohn was a great guy.
[02:53:35.509 --> 02:53:37.430]  That's why they say he was the dirtiest guy that ever lived.
[02:53:37.430 --> 02:53:40.112]  Total crap.
[02:53:40.112 --> 02:53:41.613]  Absolute bull.
[02:53:42.853 --> 02:53:46.454]  The architect of McCarthyism that has been proven.
[02:53:46.454 --> 02:53:47.634]  The Russians declassified it all.
[02:53:47.634 --> 02:53:49.055]  It was totally real.
[02:53:49.055 --> 02:53:52.796]  So when they say Trump's a Russian agent, it's a sick joke, folks.
[02:53:52.796 --> 02:53:58.078]  He sat at the knee of McCarthy's boss.
[02:53:58.078 --> 02:54:00.799]  It was Roy Cohn, folks.
[02:54:00.799 --> 02:54:03.979]  That's why there's more than 20 movies putting down Roy Cohn.
[02:54:03.979 --> 02:54:05.920]  He advised Barry Goldwater.
[02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:10.281]  He advised Larry McDonald, who they killed.
[02:54:10.281 --> 02:54:11.962]  He advised Ronald Reagan.
[02:54:15.100 --> 02:54:29.893]  And he had the top Pentagon people that weren't communists telling him, these big Carnegie Foundations and Rockefellers are going to set up Russia and China against us, and they're going to turn all the kids against their families, and they're going to break up everything, and we're not going to put up with it.
[02:54:29.893 --> 02:54:35.518]  And the minute McCarthy figured out, the minute, and said the U.S.
[02:54:35.518 --> 02:54:41.003]  Army's been ordered to prop up the Soviet Union, they came after him, destroyed him in the media.
[02:54:43.359 --> 02:54:50.782]  So there's Donald Trump's lawyer, if you're a TV viewer, with Joseph McCarthy, an incredibly honorable, patriotic man.
[02:54:50.782 --> 02:54:52.642]  But you read the history books, he's the worst person ever.
[02:54:52.642 --> 02:54:53.262]  Well, you know what?
[02:54:53.262 --> 02:54:56.724]  When I'm dead, if we don't beat these people, it's going to be that I'm the worst guy ever.
[02:54:56.724 --> 02:55:00.005]  It's not true!
[02:55:00.005 --> 02:55:03.806]  So you know when somebody's good because these liars talk about him.
[02:55:03.806 --> 02:55:10.288]  Donald Trump's dad was one of the secret funders of the John Birch Society from the start.
[02:55:10.288 --> 02:55:11.209]  Donald Trump's dad
[02:55:12.506 --> 02:55:15.129]  Got arrested and the records got expunged.
[02:55:15.129 --> 02:55:28.165]  He beat up, he got attacked by 10 communists in the 1950s who were actually beating up a police officer and he kicked all their asses and the leftist police came and arrested him.
[02:55:28.165 --> 02:55:30.187]  That's where Donald Trump comes from.
[02:55:31.147 --> 02:55:33.469]  And I know all the inside baseball folks.
[02:55:33.469 --> 02:55:34.670]  I know all the people.
[02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:41.636]  I had family involved with the whole deal back with McDonald's and all of it, okay?
[02:55:41.636 --> 02:55:47.961]  I grew up... I already knew the... I didn't even know I was getting THE reality when I was a little kid.
[02:55:47.961 --> 02:55:49.242]  And by the way, they weren't even telling me.
[02:55:49.242 --> 02:55:52.925]  I was sitting there listening.
[02:55:52.925 --> 02:55:57.549]  Little did I know, I was literally getting a crash course in how the whole enchilada operates.
[02:55:58.752 --> 02:56:18.447]  And the reason I know how the whole enchilada operates is because the people in our government who weren't traitors in 1949 saw them kill US spies and operatives by the thousands inside China to put Mao in.
[02:56:18.447 --> 02:56:20.969]  And they got pissed.
[02:56:20.969 --> 02:56:23.391]  And they said, our government's been partially taken over.
[02:56:25.208 --> 02:56:40.641]  We've got to create shadow networks to counter their shadow networks, and the shadow networks against the globalists have never been as strong, they've never been financed, but they're competent people who understood what was happening and got the word out.
[02:56:40.641 --> 02:56:44.224]  And so here we are, 70 years later, 70 years later,
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:57:02.507]  And all over the world, people know about the corporate New World Order, they know about the plan to destroy the family, and now the globalists admit in the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times today, that their world government is gone.
[02:57:02.507 --> 02:57:13.152]  They stole their wealth, they've got their power, but their plan to really screw everybody and really keep pressing and really dictate our surrender, it's all fallen apart in their hands.
[02:57:13.152 --> 02:57:14.713]  And now they're all laying low,
[02:57:16.064 --> 02:57:18.465]  On Kauai, Hawaii.
[02:57:18.465 --> 02:57:22.186]  And they're laying low out there in Tasmania, Australia.
[02:57:22.186 --> 02:57:24.487]  And they're laying low in the Cook Islands.
[02:57:24.487 --> 02:57:26.608]  They're laying low in Liechtenstein.
[02:57:26.608 --> 02:57:34.251]  They're laying low in all those other places.
[02:57:34.251 --> 02:57:36.852]  They're not going to get their world government.
[02:57:36.852 --> 02:57:41.153]  And when they're done, we're not going to have some fake Nazi roundup thing like they had in World War II.
[02:57:41.153 --> 02:57:42.774]  We're going to dig you all out of your holes.
[02:57:45.336 --> 02:57:50.860]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:57:50.860 --> 02:58:00.628]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:58:00.628 --> 02:58:08.715]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:58:09.704 --> 02:58:17.628]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:58:17.628 --> 02:58:20.730]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:58:20.730 --> 02:58:22.231]  It really is amazing.
[02:58:22.231 --> 02:58:28.934]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:58:28.934 --> 02:58:31.556]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.

[03:00:03.952 --> 03:00:06.874]  Really appreciate everybody holding.
[03:00:06.874 --> 03:00:09.875]  You're awesome.
[03:00:09.875 --> 03:00:16.318]  Last broadcast I'm doing of the year.
[03:00:21.872 --> 03:00:23.013]  How are you doing Alex?
[03:00:23.013 --> 03:00:26.515]  I just want to start out by saying I really admire what you do and Owen and
[03:00:47.881 --> 03:00:50.943]  Keep you guys in our prayers all the time.
[03:00:50.943 --> 03:00:53.645]  By the way, I don't just thank you for that, I beg you for that.
[03:00:53.645 --> 03:00:56.207]  The prayers are the only reason we're here, sir.
[03:00:56.207 --> 03:00:59.870]  Well, you don't have to beg me for anything.
[03:00:59.870 --> 03:01:05.014]  Narrow is the way, I just want to remind everybody, and this truly is a spiritual battle.
[03:01:05.014 --> 03:01:07.916]  I run a group called the U.S.
[03:01:07.916 --> 03:01:10.598]  Yellow Jackets.
[03:01:10.598 --> 03:01:14.381]  Lots of 3% has merged with some patriots.
[03:01:14.381 --> 03:01:15.682]  Everybody's called a truth.
[03:01:17.552 --> 03:01:21.054]  Unfortunately, you know, I know evil all too well.
[03:01:21.054 --> 03:01:21.834]  God saved me.
[03:01:21.834 --> 03:01:28.077]  I was shot 13 times saving a woman and her two children.
[03:01:28.077 --> 03:01:32.099]  And now I'm on to some other things.
[03:01:32.099 --> 03:01:38.842]  Vegas got me really into this and got a lot of friends that were in Vegas.
[03:01:38.842 --> 03:01:44.124]  And I just have a total realization, feel a total evil in the world.
[03:01:48.524 --> 03:02:01.532]  Well, you're right, and we know Vegas was an Islamic terror attack, meant to embarrass Trump, part of the Saudi Civil War, and I was told that by the FBI hostage rescue team, they turned out to be completely accurate.
[03:02:01.532 --> 03:02:14.360]  Then all hell broke loose once I got that information, and then I know that off record, now on record, I got investigated because of it, before Vegas, I think, actually, had an FBI investigation, because they wanted to know how I knew all that.
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:16.221]  Well, I was told by the FBI that morning.
[03:02:19.494 --> 03:02:23.480]  Yeah, and now they've had senior police go public and say there were multiple shooters.
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:25.803]  Well, of course there were.
[03:02:25.803 --> 03:02:31.471]  And that was a threat to Trump that if he didn't roll over, they were going to keep pulling that crap.
[03:02:31.471 --> 03:02:34.475]  But the good news is, is Trump has now basically rolled all those groups up.
[03:02:34.475 --> 03:02:34.896]  What do you think?
[03:02:36.872 --> 03:02:40.054]  I definitely think that they're, you know, they're brazen.
[03:02:40.054 --> 03:02:44.497]  You know, they're standing right out there and, hey, I'm, hey, I'm evil.
[03:02:44.497 --> 03:02:45.657]  You know, I worship Satan.
[03:02:45.657 --> 03:02:46.618]  Hey, look at me.
[03:02:46.618 --> 03:02:47.778]  I'm attacking your children.
[03:02:47.778 --> 03:02:49.279]  What are you going to do about it?
[03:02:49.279 --> 03:02:58.505]  Well, I can tell you that I lead a group of people that have about had enough, just good Christian people that realize that the Bible had warriors too.
[03:02:59.383 --> 03:03:00.364]  Well, exactly.
[03:03:00.364 --> 03:03:03.648]  And all I'm going to tell you is, I'm a defensive guy.
[03:03:03.648 --> 03:03:05.189]  I'm a counter puncher like Trump is.
[03:03:05.189 --> 03:03:06.991]  But they're already punching us pretty hard.
[03:03:06.991 --> 03:03:08.853]  So I'm not calling for anything.
[03:03:08.853 --> 03:03:13.418]  But I know for a fact that real antifa around the country that's attacked women and children,
[03:03:14.875 --> 03:03:17.236]  have been falling down and hitting their heads a lot.
[03:03:17.236 --> 03:03:21.536]  And that's why you don't see so many of them out except in a few cities.
[03:03:21.536 --> 03:03:23.857]  That's why you saw a lot of the censorship come out.
[03:03:23.857 --> 03:03:32.139]  I guess anybody exposing Antifa was the establishment flipping out that, let's just say it, Trump's wiped out MS-13 that works for Democrats.
[03:03:32.139 --> 03:03:38.700]  And I just heard that Antifa has been
[03:03:39.673 --> 03:03:42.674]  You know, you want to go out in public and aim guns at people and stop their free speech?
[03:03:42.674 --> 03:03:49.016]  Well, men are going to show up when you don't expect it, and you're going to fall down and hit your head.
[03:03:49.016 --> 03:03:51.417]  And so that's why you don't see so many of these guys on the street anymore, do you?
[03:03:51.417 --> 03:03:56.719]  Um, you know, I know that they're out and about.
[03:03:56.719 --> 03:03:59.119]  It seems like they like to catch people off guard.
[03:03:59.119 --> 03:04:02.340]  You know, they're never just, hey, I'm going to be here.
[03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:04.901]  Oh, but you know, that's what I said, Caleb.
[03:04:04.901 --> 03:04:06.202]  They're getting caught off guard.
[03:04:06.202 --> 03:04:06.862]  It's very sad.
[03:04:08.376 --> 03:04:09.586]  Yes sir, it is.
[03:04:09.586 --> 03:04:10.655]  It's very sad, you know.
[03:04:11.375 --> 03:04:15.717]  There might be somebody out me running counterintelligence against all this stuff.
[03:04:15.717 --> 03:04:16.558]  You never know.
[03:04:16.558 --> 03:04:17.478]  No, I get it, brother.
[03:04:17.478 --> 03:04:19.639]  They're getting their asses handed to them everywhere.
[03:04:19.639 --> 03:04:24.862]  So, that's the best type of war is a cold and silent one that runs silent and runs deep.
[03:04:24.862 --> 03:04:25.342]  God bless you.
[03:04:25.342 --> 03:04:26.022]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:26.022 --> 03:04:27.023]  All right!
[03:04:27.023 --> 03:04:28.563]  One more segment and then Mike Adams takes over.
[03:04:28.563 --> 03:04:34.947]  So, I'm going to go bam, bam, bam to Craig and D. Ray and Janice and Lee and James and Parker and Eric.
[03:04:34.947 --> 03:04:35.527]  Straight ahead.
[03:04:35.527 --> 03:04:37.348]  Infowars.com.
[03:04:37.348 --> 03:04:38.308]  Newswars.com.
[03:04:38.308 --> 03:04:39.729]  But listen, you don't want to deal with any of them.
[03:04:40.888 --> 03:04:45.070]  You want to infiltrate Democratic congressmen and get them committing crimes.
[03:04:45.070 --> 03:04:47.631]  We need good-looking women to just do it.
[03:04:47.631 --> 03:04:49.752]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[03:04:58.137 --> 03:04:59.858]  This life is a test.
[03:04:59.858 --> 03:05:12.088]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing us being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[03:05:12.088 --> 03:05:22.076]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:05:22.076 --> 03:05:26.239]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[03:05:27.165 --> 03:05:30.827]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[03:05:30.827 --> 03:05:33.488]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:05:33.488 --> 03:05:37.309]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:38.590]  2018 has been insane.
[03:05:38.590 --> 03:05:41.631]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker.
[03:05:41.631 --> 03:05:45.473]  And I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[03:05:45.473 --> 03:05:49.174]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything resisting these globalists.
[03:05:49.174 --> 03:05:53.256]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:05:58.229 --> 03:06:05.911]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:05.911 --> 03:06:07.831]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.574 --> 03:06:36.079]  So if you just joined us, you know, a lot of folks are talking about covert action against the left.
[03:06:36.079 --> 03:06:41.843]  And you don't even need covert action.
[03:06:41.843 --> 03:06:45.706]  In fact, next segment on Co-Host with Mike Adams, because I have these clips I want to play.
[03:06:45.706 --> 03:06:57.554]  They have little kids, 8, 9, 10, 11 years old, being sent into strip bars and dancing in front of men who throw money at them.
[03:06:57.554 --> 03:06:58.155]  That's illegal.
[03:06:59.070 --> 03:07:02.752]  But these jurisdictions are so evil that they're getting away with it.
[03:07:02.752 --> 03:07:05.593]  Well, then you file federal stuff on them.
[03:07:05.593 --> 03:07:12.816]  You know, we don't need to do a bunch of covert stuff that can get you locked up in prison.
[03:07:12.816 --> 03:07:24.341]  But you look at Project Veritas, all they do is send out good-looking women to intern at these places, and Democrats are such criminals, anything they say is illegal.
[03:07:24.341 --> 03:07:26.341]  And I've talked to folks behind the scenes that are involved.
[03:07:26.341 --> 03:07:27.422]  We've done some stuff ourselves.
[03:07:31.678 --> 03:07:36.321]  Democrats play satanic music on Christmas on NPR in Austin.
[03:07:36.321 --> 03:07:39.963]  They're into being bad.
[03:07:39.963 --> 03:07:41.263]  Their mind is turned over to it.
[03:07:41.263 --> 03:07:42.444]  Let me explain something.
[03:07:42.444 --> 03:07:46.026]  It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[03:07:46.026 --> 03:07:49.088]  And I'm not asking women to go be sex operatives, and I'm not going to run them.
[03:07:49.088 --> 03:07:50.629]  I'm not running an intelligence agency.
[03:07:50.629 --> 03:07:54.771]  The best type of system is where it's leaderless, but maybe I should put out a video explaining how to do this.
[03:07:56.218 --> 03:07:58.099]  I've sent Democrats to prison.
[03:07:58.099 --> 03:08:04.004]  I've done all sorts of stuff by myself, just going into a meeting and bluffing them and saying, I've got recordings of you admitting you stole $300,000.
[03:08:04.004 --> 03:08:06.466]  And they go, he did it, he did it!
[03:08:06.466 --> 03:08:14.632]  And the guy's in jail a week later and spent five years, you know, in Brownsville, East Texas.
[03:08:19.269 --> 03:08:22.673]  All Project Veritas does is walk into Akron and say, we're running child sex slaves.
[03:08:22.673 --> 03:08:24.454]  They go, damn right, that's our business.
[03:08:24.454 --> 03:08:25.856]  We'll help you run the slaves.
[03:08:25.856 --> 03:08:30.280]  Here's how you fill out the paperwork.
[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:37.468]  They're so evil that, but they think they're untouchable because they always run in their own little cities where they control the police department.
[03:08:40.213 --> 03:08:44.215]  But even in those cities, most of the police are disgusted and will leak you information.
[03:08:44.215 --> 03:08:49.758]  I'll never forget, they were taking this veteran's house in the nice area of Austin that was gentrifying for three-inch grass.
[03:08:49.758 --> 03:08:51.118]  Roland Ellington.
[03:08:51.118 --> 03:08:53.399]  Story went viral, went nationwide.
[03:08:53.399 --> 03:08:55.040]  They were giving him $2,000 a day fines.
[03:08:55.040 --> 03:08:56.341]  The cops were so pissed.
[03:08:57.605 --> 03:09:01.868]  They were ordered by Democrats to go arrest him and stuff for not paying the fines that they said.
[03:09:01.868 --> 03:09:08.813]  Mr. Jones, I had a comment line, and this guy goes, yeah, I'm a sergeant in the police department, but you don't use my name, but just here's who I am, blah, blah.
[03:09:08.813 --> 03:09:09.333]  Here's my number.
[03:09:09.333 --> 03:09:10.754]  You need information.
[03:09:10.754 --> 03:09:20.301]  He said the city councilwoman involved in all this has a couple different houses, rent houses, but a bunch of them are overgrown, have tarps on the roof, and they're violating code.
[03:09:20.301 --> 03:09:21.061]  So here's their house.
[03:09:21.061 --> 03:09:21.782]  I go out to their house.
[03:09:21.782 --> 03:09:22.122]  Guess what?
[03:09:22.122 --> 03:09:24.404]  They dropped the charges against that old guy that day.
[03:09:26.009 --> 03:09:29.952]  And it's little stuff like that.
[03:09:29.952 --> 03:09:37.837]  And so it's time to take the gloves off, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:37.837 --> 03:09:45.943]  I mean, I'm not going to tell women what to do, but if you're a sexy woman and you live in a Democrat city, I guarantee you,
[03:09:47.065 --> 03:09:48.045]  Or maybe you're a man.
[03:09:48.045 --> 03:09:49.486]  A lot of these guys are gay.
[03:09:49.486 --> 03:10:08.274]  You could, I'm not saying do this, but you could get them to take, just meet them like, you know, find out where they go, go to the bank, find out where they go to the shopping mall, find out where they go to a bar, pick them up, record them bragging about all their criminal activity.
[03:10:08.274 --> 03:10:15.997]  And while they're taking a shower, getting ready to have sex with you in that hotel room, you just leave and you dump it all on the internet.
[03:10:17.153 --> 03:10:21.055]  I mean, the Democrats are child molesters.
[03:10:21.055 --> 03:10:23.256]  Most of them know of that.
[03:10:23.256 --> 03:10:27.038]  So, I mean, I don't want to have a shoot-and-war revolution.
[03:10:27.038 --> 03:10:32.881]  The easiest way is to run operations against them.
[03:10:32.881 --> 03:10:35.362]  And anybody can research how you do this.
[03:10:35.362 --> 03:10:36.403]  And let me tell you something.
[03:10:37.350 --> 03:10:40.674]  I stumbled my way into Bohemian Grove and blew it wide open.
[03:10:40.674 --> 03:10:43.857]  I stumbled my way in and exposed all the pedophile operations.
[03:10:43.857 --> 03:10:49.203]  I stumbled my way in and exposed when they were doing gun confiscation drills under Bill Clinton.
[03:10:49.203 --> 03:10:51.446]  I'm not even that smart or good.
[03:10:51.446 --> 03:10:52.867]  I just did it.
[03:10:52.867 --> 03:10:54.929]  And sure, you can get in trouble doing it.
[03:10:54.929 --> 03:10:55.991]  You can get killed doing it.
[03:10:56.701 --> 03:10:59.062]  But you're going to get killed anyways by these people.
[03:10:59.062 --> 03:11:01.143]  Why don't you do it on your own time?
[03:11:01.143 --> 03:11:09.387]  Don't get tricked by some leftist controlled thing like QAnon and try to block the highway at the Hoover Dam.
[03:11:09.387 --> 03:11:11.628]  Don't do things that are illegal.
[03:11:11.628 --> 03:11:18.992]  Do what Veritas does.
[03:11:18.992 --> 03:11:21.093]  Do what Veritas does.
[03:11:21.093 --> 03:11:24.475]  You know, send the recording of the mayor trying to have sex with you.
[03:11:25.802 --> 03:11:28.412]  And bragging about all the stuff he's involved in.
[03:11:28.412 --> 03:11:29.497]  Send it to his wife!
[03:11:32.517 --> 03:11:33.778]  And you're like, well, how do I do that?
[03:11:33.778 --> 03:11:39.180]  Well, just go find out what his wife does and what boards she's on and what she's doing and send it to her.
[03:11:39.180 --> 03:11:42.901]  See, there's more ways to hurt these people than you can imagine.
[03:11:42.901 --> 03:11:44.622]  And it's time to start hurting them.
[03:11:44.622 --> 03:11:48.183]  And here's the thing, because they're getting ready to kill the president and shut the Internet down.
[03:11:48.183 --> 03:11:53.746]  Right now, I'm going to start on air telling you things you can do once we go dark.
[03:11:53.746 --> 03:11:56.187]  If we go to that point, we're going to start.
[03:11:56.187 --> 03:11:59.148]  This is just a small lesson, just a little little dibble.
[03:12:00.299 --> 03:12:06.805]  If they make us go dark, what do you start doing?
[03:12:06.805 --> 03:12:08.226]  And then there's other stories.
[03:12:08.226 --> 03:12:10.388]  They start killing people and rounding people up.
[03:12:10.388 --> 03:12:14.632]  Well, then it's not offensive, it's defensive.
[03:12:14.632 --> 03:12:22.960]  And then you obviously know who's who in your area.
[03:12:25.313 --> 03:12:27.835]  See, the globalists are smart.
[03:12:27.835 --> 03:12:31.478]  They hype up revolution as shooting cops pumping gas in the back of the head.
[03:12:31.478 --> 03:12:35.461]  No, if there's a violent revolution in America, you don't kill the police.
[03:12:35.461 --> 03:12:39.805]  Even if they're leftist, you just go around them.
[03:12:39.805 --> 03:12:44.428]  Because they can replace police all day long.
[03:12:44.428 --> 03:12:52.735]  They can't replace kingpins and capos.
[03:12:52.735 --> 03:12:53.716]  And these people are cowards.
[03:12:56.715 --> 03:13:02.159]  I don't want anybody to offensively do anything.
[03:13:02.159 --> 03:13:07.543]  But if they think, they're going to start killing people.
[03:13:07.543 --> 03:13:17.349]  I mean, you don't think I'm the only... Listen, a lot of people think this is a setup to like get the left to pull something.
[03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:18.130]  It's actually not.
[03:13:18.130 --> 03:13:19.111]  This is just satanic.
[03:13:19.111 --> 03:13:19.871]  These people are crazy.
[03:13:24.861 --> 03:13:27.683]  The globalists will dissolve in a shooting war in minutes.
[03:13:27.683 --> 03:13:30.885]  These are bullies that want to rape kids and abort babies.
[03:13:30.885 --> 03:13:34.107]  Because spiritually, that's what they think they can muster up to an unborn baby.
[03:13:34.107 --> 03:13:37.089]  They're such cowards, they want to kill an unborn baby.
[03:13:37.089 --> 03:13:44.934]  Man, when the fish start flying and the bullets start zipping around, these people do one thing, and that's get another set of diapers.
[03:13:44.934 --> 03:13:50.958]  Those of us that love God, it's like breathing air.
[03:13:50.958 --> 03:13:51.959]  In fact, it's a lot of fun.
[03:14:01.317 --> 03:14:03.258]  Craig in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:14:03.258 --> 03:14:04.939]  Go ahead.
[03:14:04.939 --> 03:14:08.281]  There's perhaps an association Peter Schiff should be accountable for.
[03:14:08.281 --> 03:14:13.944]  In 2017, Peter Schiff's company Schiff Gold launched a joint venture with a company called Gold Money.
[03:14:13.944 --> 03:14:19.908]  And Gold Money had a good reputation with the founder James Turk and got a good endorsement from G. Edward Griffin in 2011.
[03:14:19.908 --> 03:14:26.291]  But in 2014, a company called Bic Gold was founded with Alexander Soros.
[03:14:26.291 --> 03:14:29.473]  Soros Brothers Investment Money bought up Gold Money
[03:14:31.789 --> 03:14:35.851]  In 2015, Bitgold then switched their parent company name to Gold Money for the goodwill.
[03:14:35.851 --> 03:14:41.134]  So in effect, Schiff Company has merged with a Soros company in 2015.
[03:14:41.134 --> 03:14:47.138]  He's on Joe Rogan a lot, pumping a lot of money into Bitgold.
[03:14:47.138 --> 03:14:49.779]  Who is?
[03:14:49.779 --> 03:14:51.340]  Peter Schiff.
[03:14:51.340 --> 03:14:54.382]  Well, I didn't screen your call, but I had Peter Schiff on as a guest.
[03:14:54.382 --> 03:14:55.643]  No, I know.
[03:14:56.837 --> 03:14:59.000]  Well, no, but I'd like to look into that.
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:14:59.941]  I'm not really familiar.
[03:14:59.941 --> 03:15:02.484]  I saw him put some article on while you were talking.
[03:15:02.484 --> 03:15:06.008]  But, I mean, Soros is bought into everything.
[03:15:06.008 --> 03:15:08.551]  I'm not trying to defend Schiff.
[03:15:08.551 --> 03:15:10.173]  I don't know about this yet.
[03:15:10.173 --> 03:15:14.118]  But, I mean, are you saying he sold his company to Soros?
[03:15:14.118 --> 03:15:15.420]  He merged Joint Venture.
[03:15:16.115 --> 03:15:18.876]  Well, next time he's on, I'll bring that up to him.
[03:15:40.154 --> 03:15:41.716]  Yeah, we'll ask him about it next time it comes up.
[03:15:41.716 --> 03:15:43.478]  I mean Soros just got his fingers in everything.
[03:15:43.478 --> 03:15:46.682]  You know, that's kind of like, we used to be syndicated by ABC.
[03:15:46.682 --> 03:15:47.944]  That's just a satellite you rented.
[03:15:47.944 --> 03:15:49.306]  I wasn't with ABC.
[03:15:49.306 --> 03:15:51.288]  They had a satellite, ABC did.
[03:15:51.288 --> 03:15:52.289]  People thought I worked for ABC.
[03:15:53.217 --> 03:15:56.799]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:15:56.799 --> 03:16:00.381]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.

[03:17:59.892 --> 03:18:12.121]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing as being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[03:18:12.121 --> 03:18:22.109]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:18:22.109 --> 03:18:22.709]  Everybody knows
[03:18:23.598 --> 03:18:30.861]  Who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[03:18:30.861 --> 03:18:33.522]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:18:33.522 --> 03:18:37.344]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[03:18:37.344 --> 03:18:38.624]  2018 has been insane.
[03:18:38.624 --> 03:18:44.607]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[03:18:45.512 --> 03:18:49.193]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[03:18:49.193 --> 03:18:54.414]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:18:54.414 --> 03:18:59.935]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:18:59.935 --> 03:19:08.437]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:19:09.707 --> 03:19:17.797]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:19:18.780 --> 03:19:26.706]  There's only two groups in the US, Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:19:26.706 --> 03:19:29.829]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:19:29.829 --> 03:19:31.310]  It really is amazing.
[03:19:31.310 --> 03:19:38.016]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:19:38.016 --> 03:19:40.698]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:19:41.986 --> 03:19:43.547]  Of Infowars.
[03:19:43.547 --> 03:19:44.848]  So please spread the links.
[03:19:44.848 --> 03:19:48.191]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[03:19:48.191 --> 03:19:51.494]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:19:51.494 --> 03:19:52.835]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:19:52.835 --> 03:19:57.259]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:19:57.259 --> 03:19:59.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.575 --> 03:20:13.948]  Mind control Corruption of your thoughts
[03:20:20.669 --> 03:20:22.550]  Alright, I appreciate Mike Adams sitting in today.
[03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:24.511]  We had another guest host they had to cancel.
[03:20:24.511 --> 03:20:26.491]  And of course I'm running into his time.
[03:20:26.491 --> 03:20:27.412]  NaturalNews.com.
[03:20:27.412 --> 03:20:31.773]  He did a great job last week with that amazing breakdown of the depopulation plan.
[03:20:31.773 --> 03:20:35.315]  The New York Times has announced everything we've talked about is now being mainstream.
[03:20:35.315 --> 03:20:37.095]  But I promise to get to all the calls.
[03:20:37.095 --> 03:20:38.536]  And that's the problem.
[03:20:38.536 --> 03:20:41.037]  They may have to start limiting the phone system to like 10 lines.
[03:20:41.037 --> 03:20:43.018]  We have like 20 something lines they fill up.
[03:20:43.658 --> 03:20:48.286]  Then I promise to get to all your calls and it becomes an unwinnable game unless I spend 30 seconds with each one.
[03:20:48.286 --> 03:20:52.453]  But since one of the callers brings this up, we'll go to Mike Adams.
[03:20:52.453 --> 03:20:53.114]  David Knight.
[03:20:53.114 --> 03:20:54.577]  Parker in Georgia brings up David Knight.
[03:20:54.577 --> 03:20:56.881]  David had multiple heart surgeries this morning.
[03:20:56.881 --> 03:20:57.341]  Procedures.
[03:20:58.462 --> 03:20:59.182]  Oh man, the best.
[03:20:59.182 --> 03:21:00.462]  Hi Alex, nice to meet you.
[03:21:00.462 --> 03:21:01.143]  I have watched your show
[03:21:21.468 --> 03:21:23.269]  For about three years now.
[03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:32.971]  I got turned on on YouTube, and I watch you every chance I get, along with Hannity, Carlson, Ingram, so you're right up my alley.
[03:21:32.971 --> 03:21:34.112]  Well, thank you, sir.
[03:21:34.112 --> 03:21:48.156]  David Knight is a class act, and I don't always have a chance to catch up with you every day, but when I heard this man had a massive heart attack, I'm like, oh no, not this one.
[03:21:48.906 --> 03:21:52.089]  So, my thoughts and my prayers are with him.
[03:21:52.089 --> 03:21:56.352]  A couple of other things.
[03:21:56.352 --> 03:21:59.395]  I wanted to talk to you for a long time and I've hesitated.
[03:21:59.395 --> 03:22:01.436]  So, again, thank you for taking my call.
[03:22:01.436 --> 03:22:01.696]  No, sir.
[03:22:01.696 --> 03:22:02.697]  We appreciate you holding.
[03:22:02.697 --> 03:22:03.598]  My goodness.
[03:22:03.598 --> 03:22:06.140]  No, not a problem.
[03:22:06.140 --> 03:22:07.561]  Owen Schroyer.
[03:22:07.561 --> 03:22:08.742]  Great guy.
[03:22:08.742 --> 03:22:10.463]  A lot of fortitude there.
[03:22:10.463 --> 03:22:17.089]  So, if I could just, you know, look back on 2018 with you and some of your great stories of the year.
[03:22:18.055 --> 03:22:30.802]  Love the young man's fortitude in front of the Austin City Council and taking to task those pieces of shit on the council with regard to Planned Parenthood.
[03:22:30.802 --> 03:22:31.542]  Now you're right.
[03:22:31.542 --> 03:22:35.544]  Owen in front of City Council in three minutes does that 100% A+.
[03:22:35.544 --> 03:22:38.626]  He knocks it out of the park.
[03:22:38.626 --> 03:22:42.908]  A powerful Jedi he's already become and he's going to do so much more.
[03:22:42.908 --> 03:22:44.309]  So yes, I'm very rejoiceful.
[03:22:45.009 --> 03:22:54.573]  For not just the Infowars, but people like Mike Adams and all the guests we have, this is such a brain thrust of really good people and our listeners who are the blood of the operation.
[03:22:54.573 --> 03:22:56.814]  I don't just say that like patting you on the head.
[03:22:56.814 --> 03:23:09.599]  What you stood against and what you've done has absolutely changed all the tables around because you've got Drudge, you've got Infowars, you've got Natural News, and the 300 sites that Mike Adams has, he's probably as big as Infowars.
[03:23:11.238 --> 03:23:11.859]  We're good to go.
[03:23:32.279 --> 03:23:32.380]  And
[03:23:48.483 --> 03:23:49.763]  Part of his heart was blocked.
[03:23:49.763 --> 03:23:51.464]  So a lot of times after surgery, people get better.
[03:23:51.464 --> 03:23:53.464]  So we're all excited about that.
[03:23:53.464 --> 03:23:55.305]  Mike Adams, thanks for co-hosting today.
[03:23:55.305 --> 03:24:01.666]  And sorry I ran over to get these calls, but obviously we're talking about Mike Adams, but also just the state of the world and what you see coming up in 2019.
[03:24:01.666 --> 03:24:06.027]  I think the consensus is Trump is showing signs he's going on the offense.
[03:24:06.027 --> 03:24:09.148]  We need total offense because the left is on the offense.
[03:24:10.695 --> 03:24:24.438]  We are watching the unfolding of massive human awakening, and of course, Alex, you and InfoWars and all of us have been a big part of that, and you know, you had callers before talking about needing to be more positive.
[03:24:24.438 --> 03:24:36.141]  Obviously, it is important to give action items and to give solutions, but I need to remind people, this awakening wouldn't be happening unless people like you, Alex, were exposing the evil of our world.
[03:24:36.141 --> 03:24:38.682]  So, covering the negative is absolutely essential
[03:24:39.562 --> 03:24:43.025]  An essential ingredient to the mass awakening that's taking place right now.
[03:24:43.025 --> 03:24:44.506]  We cannot forget that.
[03:24:44.506 --> 03:24:48.750]  If you just run around being positive all the time, then we never expose the evil.
[03:24:48.750 --> 03:24:49.831]  I mean, that's what the Democrats say.
[03:24:49.831 --> 03:24:51.532]  You have to be positive all the time.
[03:24:51.532 --> 03:24:54.895]  If you're critical of anything, then that's hate speech, and then they ban you.
[03:24:54.895 --> 03:24:56.096]  Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[03:24:56.096 --> 03:24:58.818]  We have to tell both sides of what's happening.
[03:24:58.818 --> 03:24:59.979]  We have to tell the truth.
[03:24:59.979 --> 03:25:02.021]  We have to expose the evil that's happening in the world.
[03:25:02.021 --> 03:25:05.704]  So that's some of what I'm going to cover in the upcoming segments, Alex.
[03:25:06.519 --> 03:25:08.601]  Did you want me to just go into that right now?
[03:25:08.601 --> 03:25:18.611]  I wanted to get your take, too, on just how precious few, because we don't want to be the main, like, oh, there's David Knight and there's a few other people like you and folks.
[03:25:18.611 --> 03:25:22.094]  We need more people to be leaders because they're coming after everybody.
[03:25:22.094 --> 03:25:28.180]  The fact that they're taking Michael Savage off the air, the fact that they're, and it's hitting no fanfare because of his contract, he can't talk about it.
[03:25:28.180 --> 03:25:30.582]  They're doing all this ahead of a big event, which is removing Trump.
[03:25:31.863 --> 03:25:36.327]  Well, you're absolutely right, and I know that you have called for this, I have as well.
[03:25:36.327 --> 03:25:41.371]  We want thousands of people to launch their own platforms, to be their own broadcasters.
[03:25:43.747 --> 03:25:44.588]  Well, exactly.
[03:25:44.588 --> 03:25:45.649]  I mean, everywhere.
[03:25:45.649 --> 03:25:47.290]  We want massive decentralization.
[03:25:47.290 --> 03:25:49.652]  That's really what we want, because that's how we win.
[03:25:49.652 --> 03:25:56.758]  It's the centralized control and corruption that destroys the ability of people to act independently and to think for themselves.
[03:25:56.758 --> 03:26:01.281]  So, I know even you, Alex, you don't want everything to go through InfoWars.
[03:26:01.281 --> 03:26:02.883]  You want InfoWars to just be an example.
[03:26:03.483 --> 03:26:09.710]  An example of liberty and freedom so that other people can be inspired to do their own version of liberty and freedom.
[03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:11.152]  And that's what this is really about.
[03:26:11.152 --> 03:26:14.055]  You know, it's no longer... It's not even about ego.
[03:26:14.055 --> 03:26:15.797]  It's just about fighting for humanity.
[03:26:15.797 --> 03:26:17.259]  We're on Team Humanity.
[03:26:17.259 --> 03:26:18.780]  And I feel the same way.
[03:26:18.780 --> 03:26:21.944]  You know, I'm here today because I'm fighting for Team Humanity.
[03:26:21.944 --> 03:26:24.607]  I do what I do every day because I'm fighting for Team Humanity.
[03:26:24.967 --> 03:26:28.169]  You know, we're so far past this being a job or a career.
[03:26:28.169 --> 03:26:31.051]  This is about survival of the human race at this point.
[03:26:31.051 --> 03:26:32.391]  That's what we're fighting for every day.
[03:26:32.391 --> 03:26:35.513]  And we invite everyone who wants to be on that team.
[03:26:35.513 --> 03:26:38.014]  And you don't have to be huge.
[03:26:38.014 --> 03:26:40.076]  You don't have to have a big multi-million dollar operation.
[03:26:40.076 --> 03:26:42.377]  You can just tweet out the right hashtags.
[03:26:42.897 --> 03:26:52.423]  Well, so many people with a Twitter, a Facebook, or their own website, they'll have little things, big things, moderate things, but they're there when the big event happens, and then they change the world.
[03:26:52.423 --> 03:26:56.586]  Just existing as an early warning system and being here.
[03:26:56.586 --> 03:26:59.287]  I told the crew, I said, our core audience is bigger than ever.
[03:26:59.287 --> 03:27:04.791]  They've cut off a lot of our big reach, but it doesn't matter because our listeners are the early warning system now.
[03:27:04.791 --> 03:27:05.911]  We just have to hold on
[03:27:06.953 --> 03:27:13.533]  As the broadcasting system for early warning and intel and critical truthful narratives into the future.
[03:27:13.533 --> 03:27:14.375]  That's our real job.
[03:27:15.624 --> 03:27:16.705]  Exactly right.
[03:27:16.705 --> 03:27:19.728]  And along with that is this mass decentralization.
[03:27:19.728 --> 03:27:24.131]  I think 2019 is the year of accelerating decentralization.
[03:27:24.131 --> 03:27:28.895]  Because the governments are, in essence, losing trust.
[03:27:28.895 --> 03:27:30.436]  The people don't trust governments anymore.
[03:27:30.436 --> 03:27:32.578]  The people don't trust the centralized media.
[03:27:32.578 --> 03:27:34.280]  The people don't trust the EU anymore.
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:36.722]  And that's why they've done this desperate thing to censor.
[03:27:36.722 --> 03:27:38.023]  This isn't a sign of strength.
[03:27:38.023 --> 03:27:38.963]  It's a sign of weakness.
[03:27:38.963 --> 03:27:40.425]  And people have sat on the sidelines.
[03:27:40.985 --> 03:27:43.427]  Like Joe Rogan, they're just missing out on history, and I feel sorry for them.
[03:27:43.427 --> 03:27:45.248]  But the crew keeps putting this on screen.
[03:27:45.248 --> 03:27:47.390]  They've wanted me to cover it since last week.
[03:27:47.390 --> 03:27:57.717]  Dozens of prominent conservative and Democrat Twitter sites have either been locked down or removed their tweets, like the former President George Herbert Walker Bush, George W. Bush.
[03:27:57.717 --> 03:28:01.239]  Why do you think they're all making their... I mean, it's pure speculation.
[03:28:01.239 --> 03:28:03.321]  Why do you think they're having all their Twitter accounts go dark?
[03:28:04.403 --> 03:28:09.466]  Well, it's clear that this is going to accelerate until something dramatic changes.
[03:28:09.466 --> 03:28:14.528]  Apple just told us last night that they're going to ban the natural news app, by the way.
[03:28:14.528 --> 03:28:16.690]  So we're being censored off of Apple.
[03:28:16.690 --> 03:28:18.931]  I've been censored off YouTube for almost a year now.
[03:28:18.931 --> 03:28:26.415]  This is accelerating because they plan to unleash big action, I'll just put it that way, major action against Trump.
[03:28:27.015 --> 03:28:28.637]  And for the 2020 election.
[03:28:28.637 --> 03:28:31.899]  And you notice that Warren, of course, just announced that she's running for president.
[03:28:31.899 --> 03:28:37.024]  That was a strategy after she announced that she's no longer going to claim to be a woman of color.
[03:28:37.024 --> 03:28:40.206]  So they're cleaning up her history so she can try to run for president.
[03:28:40.206 --> 03:28:42.108]  Let me just throw this in briefly.
[03:28:42.108 --> 03:28:47.753]  One of the biggest Christian leaders in the world, 50 million subscribers, Franklin Graham got banned on Facebook.
[03:28:47.753 --> 03:28:49.074]  And then they backed off.
[03:28:49.074 --> 03:28:50.495]  But they're going to get everybody, folks.
[03:28:50.495 --> 03:28:51.316]  This is the big move.
[03:28:53.217 --> 03:28:56.780]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.780 --> 03:29:00.362]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.362 --> 03:29:02.484]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.484 --> 03:29:04.526]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:29:54.449 --> 03:29:57.532]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:29:57.532 --> 03:30:00.434]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.434 --> 03:30:03.397]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[03:30:03.397 --> 03:30:07.540]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron's supply.
[03:30:07.540 --> 03:30:07.981]  We're the top
[03:30:09.011 --> 03:30:18.155]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:30:18.155 --> 03:30:23.517]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[03:30:23.517 --> 03:30:25.778]  We have those incredible sell prices back.

[03:30:36.983 --> 03:30:38.044]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[03:30:38.524 --> 03:30:40.506]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:30:40.506 --> 03:30:43.068]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:30:43.068 --> 03:30:48.052]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.

[03:30:54.059 --> 03:30:59.581]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:30:59.581 --> 03:31:09.344]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:31:09.344 --> 03:31:17.407]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:31:18.427 --> 03:31:26.353]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:31:26.353 --> 03:31:29.456]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:31:29.456 --> 03:31:30.957]  It really is amazing.
[03:31:30.957 --> 03:31:37.663]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:31:37.663 --> 03:31:40.345]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:31:41.607 --> 03:31:43.168]  Of Infowars.
[03:31:43.168 --> 03:31:44.469]  So please spread the links.
[03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:47.810]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:31:47.810 --> 03:31:51.132]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:31:51.132 --> 03:31:52.453]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:31:52.453 --> 03:31:53.954]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:31:53.954 --> 03:32:01.118]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[03:32:01.718 --> 03:32:03.219]  That it lowers IQ.
[03:32:03.219 --> 03:32:06.122]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:06.122 --> 03:32:12.828]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.828 --> 03:32:19.094]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:19.094 --> 03:32:24.699]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.379 --> 03:32:32.402]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:32.402 --> 03:32:46.489]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:32:46.489 --> 03:32:50.751]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:32:50.751 --> 03:32:53.432]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:32:56.733 --> 03:33:10.719]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.719 --> 03:33:17.402]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:17.402 --> 03:33:19.723]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:33:19.723 --> 03:33:22.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.970 --> 03:33:29.712]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the rest of the hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.712 --> 03:33:31.073]  Thank you for joining me.
[03:33:31.073 --> 03:33:33.134]  This has been a very interesting show already.
[03:33:33.134 --> 03:33:34.655]  I've been listening.
[03:33:34.655 --> 03:33:38.658]  And a lot of talk about, you know, positivity for 2019 and beyond.
[03:33:38.658 --> 03:33:48.864]  And let me just say on the record that one of the most positive truths that we should all embrace right now is recognizing that humanity has a choice.
[03:33:49.608 --> 03:33:53.511]  Humanity has a choice about where we take the future of our world.
[03:33:53.511 --> 03:34:05.959]  Are we going to live as slaves under a techno-tyranny run by fake news media organizations, cry-bullies in the education system, language police everywhere?
[03:34:05.959 --> 03:34:07.920]  Are we going to submit to that?
[03:34:07.920 --> 03:34:17.286]  Or are we going to rise up with reason and passion and love for liberty and love for humanity, love for our children?
[03:34:17.939 --> 03:34:20.061]  Love for our nation.
[03:34:20.061 --> 03:34:23.003]  Love for safety and the rule of law.
[03:34:23.003 --> 03:34:38.756]  You know, that's a choice that we have as human beings right now, being that we're conscious, but making that choice, and this is what's critical, and this is why InfoWars is so important, making that choice requires us to be informed.
[03:34:38.756 --> 03:34:43.600]  And so the primary focus of the corporate controlled media is to control
[03:34:45.620 --> 03:34:49.103]  That information and also isolate you from the truth.
[03:34:49.103 --> 03:34:50.184]  That's their point.
[03:34:50.184 --> 03:34:53.326]  Because they want you to be enslaved, obviously, you know that.
[03:34:53.326 --> 03:35:05.696]  But they do that by isolating you from truthful information, which is why the censorship has to target InfoWars or Natural News or Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, whoever.
[03:35:05.696 --> 03:35:06.817]  That's why.
[03:35:06.817 --> 03:35:10.580]  Because the truth is now defined as hate speech.
[03:35:10.580 --> 03:35:11.861]  The truth is hate speech.
[03:35:11.861 --> 03:35:13.643]  And as another great example of that,
[03:35:14.480 --> 03:35:22.725]  Facebook is now banning the sharing of our articles that talk about the dangers of 5G networks.
[03:35:22.725 --> 03:35:23.666]  Think about that.
[03:35:23.666 --> 03:35:37.935]  When we talk about brain cancer being caused by exposure to 5G cell signals and the weaponization of the cell tower network, Facebook bans that and says it's a violation of their community guidelines.
[03:35:37.935 --> 03:35:38.595]  So wait a minute.
[03:35:39.344 --> 03:35:48.394]  Does that mean that if we say, uh, cell towers are awesome, everybody hold a phone to your head so you get cancer, that Facebook would say, yeah, that's good.
[03:35:48.394 --> 03:35:49.255]  That's okay.
[03:35:49.255 --> 03:35:50.276]  You can share that.
[03:35:50.276 --> 03:35:51.397]  Good information.
[03:35:51.397 --> 03:35:52.759]  Good on you, mate.
[03:35:52.759 --> 03:35:53.400]  Is that what they would do?
[03:35:54.338 --> 03:36:09.617]  But when you warn people about 5G, and you try to protect humanity, and you try to help people be safe, maybe limiting their time on a 5G device, or moving out of the city and not even being exposed to it at all, that's considered offensive?
[03:36:09.617 --> 03:36:11.259]  That's considered a violation?
[03:36:12.125 --> 03:36:13.686]  Same thing with vaccines.
[03:36:13.686 --> 03:36:22.890]  If you try to teach people, hey, why are you vaccinating these young infants with so many vaccines at such a young age before their immune system has developed?
[03:36:22.890 --> 03:36:27.572]  Why don't you, even if you're going to do vaccines, why don't you spread them out?
[03:36:27.572 --> 03:36:29.033]  Why don't you delay them?
[03:36:29.033 --> 03:36:36.956]  Why are you giving a 16-month-old baby an HPV vaccine that protects them against a sexually transmitted disease?
[03:36:36.956 --> 03:36:40.298]  Are there 16-month-old infants that are sexually active?
[03:36:40.298 --> 03:36:41.018]  God, I hope not!
[03:36:41.966 --> 03:36:43.948]  That vaccine makes no sense at that age.
[03:36:43.948 --> 03:36:45.229]  Why are you doing it so early?
[03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:47.872]  Why are you hitting that baby with so many vaccines at once?
[03:36:47.872 --> 03:36:50.694]  But if you say that, oh, you're banned!
[03:36:50.694 --> 03:36:53.757]  Because, oh, now that might be offensive to somebody.
[03:36:53.757 --> 03:36:56.440]  That might be objectionable content.
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:01.985]  Pinterest has banned all such content now that talks about the dangers of vaccines.
[03:37:02.620 --> 03:37:07.562]  If you even talk about vaccine ingredients, just the scientific facts, what's in the vaccine?
[03:37:07.562 --> 03:37:10.783]  Here are the ingredients according to the FDA and the CDC.
[03:37:10.783 --> 03:37:12.463]  That will get you banned on Pinterest.
[03:37:12.463 --> 03:37:19.026]  So you see, what this all has in common is making sure that people don't get good information.
[03:37:19.026 --> 03:37:23.327]  And that's why what we do here at InfoWars is so crucial.
[03:37:23.327 --> 03:37:32.070]  We're bringing you the information that helps empower humanity so that human beings can make a conscious, informed choice to choose freedom.
[03:37:32.702 --> 03:37:42.888]  And that's why spreading the information about this broadcast, and these videos, and the articles on newswars.com, and, you know, the videos from Paul Joseph Watson and everybody else, that's why it's so crucial.
[03:37:42.888 --> 03:37:52.993]  And that's why we are, in essence, really winning, as Alex said earlier in the show today, we are winning the war for the minds of the free-thinking citizens of the world.
[03:37:52.993 --> 03:37:58.216]  The globalist centralization effort is really starting to accelerate its collapse.
[03:37:58.996 --> 03:38:04.702]  And I'm going to make a prediction here right now about something big that I think is going to happen globally.
[03:38:04.702 --> 03:38:09.786]  I'll get to that in just a second, but first I want to share with you on this issue of making a choice.
[03:38:09.786 --> 03:38:22.519]  You know, I was telling a member of the crew there during the break, over the holidays, like what I did, I did hardcore combat training with former Marines who are experts in combatives.
[03:38:23.303 --> 03:38:33.570]  And so, you know, they had me in arm bars and we were doing weapon takeaways and it was a lot of mat work and I got beat up and I'm sore as heck and my elbow hurts.
[03:38:33.570 --> 03:38:36.091]  And I got my head bashed in a couple of times as well.
[03:38:36.091 --> 03:38:44.076]  It was not fun, but I made the choice to do that instead of just going out drinking, going out partying, going out and socializing.
[03:38:44.076 --> 03:38:44.737]  I made a choice.
[03:38:45.569 --> 03:38:53.613]  To focus on skills that I think might be useful for survival, preparedness, self-defense, as our world becomes more chaotic.
[03:38:53.613 --> 03:38:56.095]  The point is, you have that choice too.
[03:38:56.095 --> 03:39:00.017]  And your form of preparedness might be completely different from mine.
[03:39:00.017 --> 03:39:01.918]  And that's okay.
[03:39:01.918 --> 03:39:04.139]  But what are you doing with your day?
[03:39:04.139 --> 03:39:07.121]  What are you doing with every precious hour that you have?
[03:39:07.121 --> 03:39:12.744]  What are you doing with your actions right now, beyond just listening to this program?
[03:39:13.573 --> 03:39:21.059]  Which is a great starting point, but what actions are you taking to share this information and impact your own personal life?
[03:39:21.059 --> 03:39:22.140]  Are you prepared?
[03:39:22.140 --> 03:39:23.621]  Do you have a bug-out bag?
[03:39:23.621 --> 03:39:26.704]  Do you have a plan to get out of the city, if you live in a city?
[03:39:26.704 --> 03:39:35.871]  You know, the last time I hosted this show, I talked about the government report that warned 99 nuclear power plants across America could go into a meltdown.
[03:39:35.871 --> 03:39:40.295]  This was a government report because of a grid-down power failure.
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:44.081]  How close are you to a nuclear power plant?
[03:39:44.081 --> 03:39:49.424]  Do you have a plan to get away on foot or bicycle if there's an EMP attack?
[03:39:49.424 --> 03:39:51.085]  Do you have a plan?
[03:39:51.085 --> 03:40:03.411]  Because you should take, in my opinion, you should take this time, some of this time at least, I mean time with family is important and time off is important, but take some of this time and invest it in your future, invest it in your survival.
[03:40:03.411 --> 03:40:04.211]  Are you prepared?
[03:40:04.211 --> 03:40:05.432]  Do you have the skills?
[03:40:05.432 --> 03:40:09.234]  Do you have the fitness level to walk 20 miles in a day with a 50 pound back?
[03:40:10.173 --> 03:40:33.512]  Bag on your on your back if you don't have that fitness level get out and start walking just start walking Just walk around the street walk around the mall walk around a farm field Whatever just just get out get that fitness going Because that will serve you for the rest of your life And these are actions that you can take don't let it just be a theoretical thing in your head like oh yeah Mike Adams sounds sounds correct.
[03:40:33.512 --> 03:40:36.054]  Yeah, that's a good thing and I'm gonna go back to playing video games.
[03:40:36.054 --> 03:40:37.835]  No take action and
[03:40:38.354 --> 03:40:42.295]  Do what you need to do now, because time is running short.
[03:40:42.295 --> 03:40:45.235]  Now, to my prediction.
[03:40:45.235 --> 03:40:47.636]  Big prediction.
[03:40:47.636 --> 03:40:56.538]  I believe that there is a... We're seeing the opening stages of the economic and environmental collapse of Communist China.
[03:40:56.538 --> 03:41:01.419]  I believe that Communist China will collapse in the next few years.
[03:41:01.419 --> 03:41:03.199]  It might be two, it might be ten.
[03:41:04.082 --> 03:41:05.263]  But it has begun.
[03:41:05.263 --> 03:41:11.487]  And this is because the citizens of China, enough of them, want to be free.
[03:41:11.487 --> 03:41:23.054]  And China, even with all of the censorship efforts, has not been able to absolutely control everything that its own citizens do and think and say or speak or share.
[03:41:23.054 --> 03:41:29.598]  The end of communist China, I believe, is coming in much the way the end of the Soviet Union happened.
[03:41:29.598 --> 03:41:32.260]  It will be all of a sudden, overnight.
[03:41:33.163 --> 03:41:36.566]  It will be like Tiananmen Square, but it will succeed.
[03:41:36.566 --> 03:41:43.753]  It might be the students, as what happened in 1989, or it might be another demographic in that society.
[03:41:43.753 --> 03:41:49.798]  But what's going to accelerate this, believe it or not, is the globalist banker attack on President Trump.
[03:41:49.798 --> 03:41:58.566]  The globalists are trying to crash the global debt system, and they're going to cause the economic collapse of China as a result.
[03:41:59.378 --> 03:42:23.816]  So, in other words, it's going to be collateral damage from the globalist point of view that has communist China suffering a massive debt collapse, also an environmental collapse, because there's so much mass poisoning, industrial waste going into the food supply in China, going into the rivers and the air and the soil and so on, that they're going to suffer a simultaneous ecological collapse as well as a financial collapse.
[03:42:23.816 --> 03:42:28.059]  You won't know for sure that that's happening until the day
[03:42:28.897 --> 03:42:30.878]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember,
[03:42:57.148 --> 03:42:58.869]  This life is a test.
[03:42:58.869 --> 03:43:11.097]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity, coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[03:43:11.097 --> 03:43:21.084]  Listening to M4 wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty, that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[03:43:21.084 --> 03:43:25.247]  Everybody knows, who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians, who tend to
[03:43:26.175 --> 03:43:29.838]  Be immune to the globalist brainwashing, and who tend to see it.
[03:43:29.838 --> 03:43:32.500]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:43:32.500 --> 03:43:36.322]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[03:43:36.322 --> 03:43:37.603]  2018 has been insane.
[03:43:37.603 --> 03:43:44.488]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[03:43:44.488 --> 03:43:48.171]  Not behind us, but right beside us, and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[03:43:48.171 --> 03:43:52.274]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together, and I salute you.
[03:43:53.283 --> 03:43:56.006]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[03:43:56.006 --> 03:44:02.333]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[03:44:02.333 --> 03:44:04.095]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[03:44:04.095 --> 03:44:10.662]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[03:44:10.882 --> 03:44:11.202]  I think so.
[03:44:28.609 --> 03:44:29.069]  I think so.
[03:44:54.212 --> 03:44:59.735]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:44:59.735 --> 03:45:09.501]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:45:09.501 --> 03:45:17.586]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:45:18.598 --> 03:45:26.502]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:45:26.502 --> 03:45:29.604]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:45:29.604 --> 03:45:31.105]  It really is amazing.
[03:45:31.105 --> 03:45:37.808]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:45:37.808 --> 03:45:40.430]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.

[03:46:57.752 --> 03:47:00.374]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.792 --> 03:47:17.073]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:47:17.073 --> 03:47:22.814]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:22.814 --> 03:47:30.495]  I want to bring in a reminder of how evil the tech giants really are.
[03:47:30.495 --> 03:47:37.116]  It was five years ago that Whole Foods promised they would label all GMOs by the end of 2018.
[03:47:37.116 --> 03:47:39.837]  And no, we haven't forgotten.
[03:47:40.532 --> 03:47:46.915]  We've been waiting for this day to find out if Whole Foods would keep its promise or betray its customers.
[03:47:46.915 --> 03:48:02.161]  Now, five years ago, in 2013, they posted a statement on their website that said, quote, we have set a deadline that by 2018 all products in our US and Canadian stores must be labeled to indicate whether they contain genetically modified organisms.
[03:48:02.884 --> 03:48:10.349]  Whole Foods Market is the first national grocery chain to set a deadline for full GMO transparency.
[03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:12.531]  That's what they said five years ago.
[03:48:12.531 --> 03:48:19.115]  Today, they have modified that statement and they have failed to meet their deadline.
[03:48:19.115 --> 03:48:26.780]  They say today, quote, as always, our goal is to provide our customer with information to help make informed choices.
[03:48:26.780 --> 03:48:28.502]  Period.
[03:48:28.502 --> 03:48:29.242]  That's it.
[03:48:29.242 --> 03:48:30.243]  So, of course, Bezos
[03:48:30.976 --> 03:48:41.985]  Well, Amazon purchased Whole Foods, and that's the time, I believe, that that statement was modified, and that's the time, I believe, they abandoned their commitment to label GMOs.
[03:48:41.985 --> 03:48:44.407]  But they're counting on you not remembering anything.
[03:48:44.407 --> 03:48:48.210]  I mean, five years ago seems like an eternity in today's news cycle.
[03:48:48.210 --> 03:48:53.154]  Who's going to remember that Whole Foods promised to label GMOs five years ago?
[03:48:53.154 --> 03:48:55.116]  Apparently, not very many people.
[03:48:55.116 --> 03:48:57.638]  And so, they betrayed their customers.
[03:48:57.638 --> 03:48:59.179]  They lied.
[03:48:59.179 --> 03:48:59.760]  Whole Foods
[03:49:00.566 --> 03:49:01.827]  They are liars.
[03:49:01.827 --> 03:49:05.711]  And Jeff Bezos is a liar and a deceiver.
[03:49:05.711 --> 03:49:17.661]  And if I told you all the products that we have tested in our lab from Amazon.com that are full of heavy metals and glyphosate and pesticides, you would be astonished.
[03:49:17.661 --> 03:49:18.862]  But that's the truth.
[03:49:18.862 --> 03:49:19.863]  That's the simple truth.
[03:49:19.863 --> 03:49:21.805]  So remember that.
[03:49:21.805 --> 03:49:22.746]  I want to do a story on that.
[03:49:22.746 --> 03:49:25.008]  In fact, I might suggest to the InfoWars crew that
[03:49:25.888 --> 03:49:32.931]  You might send somebody out there and go shopping at Whole Foods on camera and see if anything's labeled GMO and call them out on that.
[03:49:32.931 --> 03:49:37.473]  Because they need to be, of course, held accountable for their lies to the public.
[03:49:37.473 --> 03:49:43.595]  You know, this is just a great example of how food has been weaponized against the people.
[03:49:43.595 --> 03:49:51.438]  And that's one of the themes, really, from 2016 to today, is the mass weaponization of every sector of society.
[03:49:52.074 --> 03:49:53.614]  Of every institution.
[03:49:53.614 --> 03:49:56.495]  Science has become weaponized against the people.
[03:49:56.495 --> 03:49:59.035]  Food, as I mentioned, but also medicine.
[03:49:59.035 --> 03:50:01.176]  The massive psychiatric drugging of children.
[03:50:01.176 --> 03:50:03.796]  The massive antidepressant drugging of adults.
[03:50:03.796 --> 03:50:09.777]  The statin drugs that harm and kill people, but are just prescribed like candy.
[03:50:09.777 --> 03:50:11.177]  Even history has been weaponized.
[03:50:11.177 --> 03:50:16.418]  The liberals are altering history to try to make you think something different about what actually happened.
[03:50:16.418 --> 03:50:19.379]  To try to get you to hate your own country and hate the founding fathers.
[03:50:20.086 --> 03:50:22.927]  You know, news has been weaponized.
[03:50:22.927 --> 03:50:27.207]  Of course, news is all fake news now from the corporate-run media.
[03:50:27.207 --> 03:50:41.670]  Look at the Jim Acosta video where he shoved that woman's hand down her arm, that White House intern, and then the media said that when Paul Joseph Watson covered it, said, oh, it was doctored.
[03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:42.810]  Now, you want to talk about doctored?
[03:50:42.810 --> 03:50:45.431]  You can't get more doctored than CNN.
[03:50:45.431 --> 03:50:46.631]  They doctor almost everything.
[03:50:46.631 --> 03:50:47.571]  They twist everything.
[03:50:48.283 --> 03:50:56.510]  And so this is a time of the incredible weaponization of every institution against humanity.
[03:50:56.510 --> 03:51:08.440]  And yet, at the same time, and here I'm going to bring in the positive side of this a little bit, at the same time, we have access now to the most incredible brain-enhancing nutrition
[03:51:09.677 --> 03:51:15.481]  And supplements and superfoods that have ever been known in the history of humanity.
[03:51:15.481 --> 03:51:17.542]  And this isn't even a store plug or anything.
[03:51:17.542 --> 03:51:22.846]  It's just acknowledging that you look at these superfoods and these spices like turmeric.
[03:51:22.846 --> 03:51:26.908]  You know, we cover turmeric almost every day, it seems.
[03:51:26.908 --> 03:51:28.610]  I've got a website, turmeric.news.
[03:51:28.610 --> 03:51:29.991]  You could just look at the headlines there.
[03:51:29.991 --> 03:51:34.413]  And InfoWars store sells various turmeric products, I believe.
[03:51:34.413 --> 03:51:35.974]  Bodies is one of them.
[03:51:35.974 --> 03:51:38.196]  But just look at turmeric.
[03:51:38.837 --> 03:51:50.267]  It is a miracle superfood, and it's available to us today in a way that wasn't available to, you know, just three or four generations ago, or not even that.
[03:51:50.267 --> 03:51:53.730]  People in the early 1900s, it was hard to get turmeric.
[03:51:53.730 --> 03:52:01.337]  It was hard to get many of these spices, you know, like star anise spice, which is in Chinese medicine.
[03:52:01.337 --> 03:52:04.260]  It is one of the Chinese medicine cures for bird flu.
[03:52:05.188 --> 03:52:08.189]  For example, and pandemics.
[03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:12.191]  There's so many incredible superfoods that we now have access to.
[03:52:12.191 --> 03:52:17.933]  And you see that in people who take advantage of good nutrition.
[03:52:17.933 --> 03:52:21.774]  They keep getting smarter and smarter and more informed and more aware.
[03:52:21.774 --> 03:52:26.956]  But people that live on junk food, processed food, GMO food, sold by Whole Foods, they keep getting dumber.
[03:52:27.631 --> 03:52:30.014]  They keep getting just less aware.
[03:52:30.014 --> 03:52:32.437]  Their worldview becomes more and more narrow.
[03:52:32.437 --> 03:52:36.362]  They act like parrots or sheeple all the time.
[03:52:36.362 --> 03:52:41.108]  And there's almost no more what I call nutritional middle class.
[03:52:41.108 --> 03:52:44.493]  There's either people who are taking in good nutrition,
[03:52:45.589 --> 03:52:50.131]  Or there's people who are just living on junk foods and processed foods, and that includes a lot of vegans, too.
[03:52:50.131 --> 03:52:52.092]  A lot of vegan junk food people.
[03:52:52.092 --> 03:52:54.554]  They're eating Cheetos and like, ah, it's vegan.
[03:52:54.554 --> 03:52:56.054]  Yeah, but it's junk food.
[03:52:56.054 --> 03:52:58.375]  You know, veganism is supposed to be healthy.
[03:52:58.375 --> 03:53:00.837]  Why are you eating junk food vegan food?
[03:53:00.837 --> 03:53:02.458]  It makes no sense.
[03:53:02.458 --> 03:53:05.219]  But you see, it comes down to your choice.
[03:53:05.219 --> 03:53:08.581]  And that's why I said previously, humanity has this powerful choice.
[03:53:08.581 --> 03:53:11.242]  You can choose to protect your neurology
[03:53:12.548 --> 03:53:20.492]  I'm telling you, we publish stories every day that talk about foods that protect against Alzheimer's and dementia, neuroprotective foods.
[03:53:20.492 --> 03:53:26.874]  You can consume those now and you can protect your brain and your consciousness and your awareness for the rest of your life.
[03:53:26.874 --> 03:53:33.057]  There are foods that protect your heart, foods that protect your pancreas and blood sugar and metabolism.
[03:53:33.669 --> 03:53:35.369]  You can choose to do that.
[03:53:35.369 --> 03:53:46.212]  Or, you can live a life on junk food and GMOs and pesticides and eat glyphosate until you die, but of course the medical establishment will make a lot of money off of you during your suffering and death because that's the model.
[03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:47.032]  That's the racket.
[03:53:47.032 --> 03:53:52.154]  Food is a weapon system to make you a patient of the pharmaceutical medical system.
[03:53:52.154 --> 03:54:00.416]  And the way to opt out of that, the way to free yourself from that, is to stop eating their damn poison.
[03:54:00.416 --> 03:54:01.476]  Stop eating their poison.
[03:54:02.222 --> 03:54:04.183]  And start nourishing yourself.
[03:54:04.183 --> 03:54:06.904]  Start eating real food or even growing some of your own food.
[03:54:06.904 --> 03:54:08.945]  It doesn't all have to be supplements or superfoods.
[03:54:08.945 --> 03:54:10.786]  You can grow your own medicine.
[03:54:10.786 --> 03:54:11.866]  It's incredible.
[03:54:11.866 --> 03:54:13.487]  You can grow oregano.
[03:54:13.487 --> 03:54:19.709]  You can grow, you know, cilantro even has detoxification properties.
[03:54:19.709 --> 03:54:21.730]  You can grow your own food.
[03:54:21.730 --> 03:54:25.212]  Or you can do a combination of growing it and buying it from somebody else.
[03:54:25.212 --> 03:54:28.213]  This is how, believe it or not, this is how you defeat the globalists.
[03:54:30.317 --> 03:54:34.539]  Look, you can't beat the globalists if your brain doesn't work.
[03:54:34.539 --> 03:54:38.421]  And half of the attacks on humanity today are attacks on your neurology.
[03:54:38.421 --> 03:54:42.403]  It is the aluminum and the mercury in the vaccines.
[03:54:42.403 --> 03:54:47.185]  It is the psychiatric drugs, the psychotropic effects that they generate.
[03:54:47.185 --> 03:54:49.206]  It is the heavy metals in the food supply.
[03:54:49.206 --> 03:54:50.887]  It is the pesticides.
[03:54:50.887 --> 03:54:54.128]  They are especially dangerous to cognitive function.
[03:54:54.128 --> 03:54:55.289]  This is all a weapon system.
[03:54:56.334 --> 03:55:01.598]  You can avoid it by choosing clean food and by choosing supplements that protect you from those things.
[03:55:01.598 --> 03:55:04.461]  Like I've said this before, I call it defensive eating.
[03:55:04.461 --> 03:55:08.444]  If you go eat a barbecue meal, which I enjoy from time to time too.
[03:55:08.444 --> 03:55:10.345]  Let's say you eat brisket.
[03:55:10.345 --> 03:55:12.407]  Well, brisket is slightly burned.
[03:55:12.407 --> 03:55:13.548]  The fat is burned.
[03:55:13.548 --> 03:55:15.490]  That's part of what gives it a good flavor.
[03:55:15.490 --> 03:55:19.233]  But those are cancer-causing chemicals in that burning of the fat.
[03:55:19.233 --> 03:55:22.095]  But how can you enjoy it and keep yourself safe at the same time?
[03:55:22.095 --> 03:55:23.476]  It's very simple.
[03:55:23.476 --> 03:55:25.878]  Take vitamin C and then eat your brisket.
[03:55:26.508 --> 03:55:32.897]  Because vitamin C counteracts most of the effects of the oxidation of that burned barbecue.
[03:55:32.897 --> 03:55:34.740]  Or, you could eat raw cabbage.
[03:55:35.643 --> 03:55:36.884]  Raw cabbage, guess what?
[03:55:36.884 --> 03:55:40.927]  Number one ingredient in coleslaw, served with barbecue.
[03:55:40.927 --> 03:55:50.135]  So if you eat coleslaw, or a salad, or take some vitamin C, or eat some strawberries, which are naturally rich in vitamin C, then you can enjoy some brisket.
[03:55:50.135 --> 03:55:52.196]  You can enjoy, you know, a hamburger.
[03:55:52.196 --> 03:55:57.180]  You don't have to be a food Nazi, in other words, if you know how to defend yourself.
[03:55:57.180 --> 03:55:57.801]  And I think that
[03:55:58.638 --> 03:56:11.627]  For 2019, I think what I'm going to really work to contribute to InfoWars is unique information that probably no one else can bring to the table here, which is how can you defend yourself when you go out to eat?
[03:56:11.627 --> 03:56:16.390]  You eat at a restaurant or you eat sweets at a wedding party or a celebration or something.
[03:56:16.390 --> 03:56:18.131]  How do you protect yourself against that?
[03:56:18.131 --> 03:56:22.354]  Because there are things that you can take, there are things that you can do beforehand
[03:56:23.186 --> 03:56:29.331]  So that you can still enjoy society or eating out with friends or so on, but you're protecting your brain at the same time.
[03:56:29.331 --> 03:56:33.294]  And I'll tell you right now that turmeric is absolutely one of those solutions.
[03:56:33.294 --> 03:56:35.336]  Turmeric is just incredible.
[03:56:35.336 --> 03:56:38.818]  It is probably the number one most important food that you need to take in.
[03:56:38.818 --> 03:56:40.119]  So you can get it in curry.
[03:56:40.119 --> 03:56:41.761]  You can go buy turmeric spice.
[03:56:41.761 --> 03:56:44.022]  You can just dump it into your smoothie.
[03:56:44.022 --> 03:56:44.843]  I do that every day.
[03:56:44.843 --> 03:56:46.965]  I've done that for years.
[03:56:46.965 --> 03:56:51.568]  And or you can get turmeric supplements, you know, like like InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:56:51.568 --> 03:56:52.149]  They've got some.
[03:56:52.839 --> 03:57:00.623]  But when you have this knowledge, your brain becomes bulletproof in essence, you know, against the toxins.
[03:57:00.623 --> 03:57:03.925]  I don't mean physically bulletproof, but you'll be able to protect yourself.
[03:57:03.925 --> 03:57:05.325]  And that's how we defeat the globalists.
[03:57:05.325 --> 03:57:07.366]  We've got to have that nutritional basis.
[03:57:07.366 --> 03:57:09.167]  And that's the good news for 2019 and beyond.
[03:57:11.152 --> 03:57:12.432]  I'm Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[03:57:12.432 --> 03:57:13.313]  I'm a food scientist.
[03:57:13.313 --> 03:57:16.353]  That's what I'm going to really work to bring you in 2019.
[03:57:16.353 --> 03:57:17.414]  Thank you for joining us today.
[03:57:17.414 --> 03:57:19.094]  I appreciate all your support.
[03:57:19.094 --> 03:57:20.995]  I appreciate everything you do.
[03:57:20.995 --> 03:57:24.756]  I'm here fighting for humanity, just like everybody else at InfoWars.

[03:57:36.639 --> 03:57:37.259]  It's coming up next.
[03:57:43.171 --> 03:57:48.334]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[03:57:48.334 --> 03:57:50.295]  That's the globalist only hope.

[03:58:28.472 --> 03:58:37.155]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[03:58:37.375 --> 03:58:39.062]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
