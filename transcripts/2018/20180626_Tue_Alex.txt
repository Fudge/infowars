[00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:33.776]  It's Tuesday, the 26th day of June 2018.
[00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:42.002]  And I come in here occasionally, every few months, and I say, this may be the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:51.730]  I used to say that every couple of years, but there's a quickening, a lot of big things happening, and everyone knows that Infowars has its finger on the zeitgeist.
[00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.857]  You've heard me saying they plan on civil unrest leading to civil war, soft civil war, it's a term I coined about a year and a half ago.
[00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:09.438]  Watching the enemy's activities, watching what they've done in other countries, knowing that it is stay-behind networks of globalists in the CIA running this.
[00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:15.839]  Well, the blueprints of how they've done this in other countries and then how they've operated here domestically are crystal clear.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:30.203]  And yesterday, if you'll remember, I rebroadcast about half the show because I was so pregnant and thought that I was not saying at all or not
[00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.471]  Giving you the future, because I've already told you what was coming, and then now it's here.
[00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.191]  So I need to stop proving I was right.
[00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.092]  I need to tell you what's going to happen.
[00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:50.814]  Now the White House watches, the Pentagon watches, and they've got a good idea as well, but I'm going to lay out exactly what Mueller's going to do.
[00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:54.195]  I'm going to lay out exactly what Pelosi's going to do.
[00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:59.276]  I'm going to lay out exactly what Brennan and Clapper and all the usual suspects
[00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.559]  And Comey are going to do.
[00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:10.163]  And we've got their battle plan, so this is a big deal.
[00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:13.825]  We need to lay it all out.
[00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:23.831]  Because this is undoubtedly, up to this point, the most important broadcast that I've ever done.
[00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:26.092]  And it is...
[00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:41.879]  Incumbent on everyone to understand why they're trying to squeeze down InfoWars and why they're trying to block us is because they know our talking points are dead on and will torpedo their entire agenda.
[00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:52.767]  And they know that if the talking points get to the president, who is now back to doing whatever he wants, that they're done.
[00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.491]  Now, Trump already has great instincts and doesn't need me to tell him what to do.
[00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:07.740]  But I have been asked to present what I think to the military, the police, and everyone else.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.000]  And I'm going to do that.
[00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:14.841]  And it's a big responsibility.
[00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:20.123]  But I can tell you that this is the only broadcast out there that's doing anything like this.
[00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.323]  Sean Hannity has begun to do some of it.
[00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:23.023]  That's wonderful.
[00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:24.884]  That's why they want him off the air.
[00:03:25.964 --> 00:03:26.824]  Tucker Carlson's done.
[00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:27.264]  That's great.
[00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:29.145]  But they are under a lot of pressure.
[00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:33.768]  And I know for a fact, Hannity was almost thrown out a year ago.
[00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.810]  But he didn't back down.
[00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.974]  So I'm just telling you, there is a very small fraternity of people that'll even go near the reality.
[00:03:44.014 --> 00:03:48.897]  And I have been asked, because other people are waiting, I have to do it first.
[00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:50.838]  You understand that?
[00:03:52.408 --> 00:03:58.612]  And I thought it was like when Soros would put this in his publications constantly and saying, we're following Jones's talking points, we've got to shut him down.
[00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:01.133]  I thought, oh, well, they just think I'm just discrediting.
[00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:03.435]  So they're always focusing on me as a way to hurt Trump.
[00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:04.015]  That's not what it is.
[00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:04.816]  They've got it figured out.
[00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:09.338]  And it is a real revelation.
[00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.340]  It's also a sickening burden.
[00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:18.944]  You know, the average little narcissistic devil worshiper out there would just love to have power because they have no idea what they'd even do with it.
[00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.083]  I feel like one of the minions in Despicable Me, you know, blowing itself up with TNT or something.
[00:04:25.644 --> 00:04:28.866]  So this is big stuff, and I just have to tell you how big it is.
[00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:35.450]  I can't just sit here and put out the info and then not tell you that it is the info.
[00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.011]  It is the info.
[00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:39.272]  And it is the future.
[00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:42.214]  And if you have the enemy battle plan, you should be able to stop it.
[00:04:42.794 --> 00:04:46.496]  So I've told you everything up until now, what's going to happen, and it's happened 98%, like I said.
[00:04:47.617 --> 00:04:49.018]  But we can change the future.
[00:04:49.884 --> 00:04:51.006]  It's choose your own adventure.
[00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:56.513]  So when we come back, I'm going to brief the world, the military, the police, everybody about possible futures.
[00:04:57.234 --> 00:04:59.057]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:04:59.077 --> 00:04:59.478]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:05.619]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.460]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:13.123]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.

[00:06:17.913 --> 00:06:19.576]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:21.559]  Because there is a war on.
[00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:22.981]  Or your mind.
[00:06:23.021 --> 00:06:24.022]  It's Tuesday, June 26, 2018.
[00:06:24.102 --> 00:06:26.927]  I'm about to brief the listeners, the viewers, the President.
[00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:46.142]  Individuals watching around the world about the current best estimates on the globalist attack plan for Europe and the United States.
[00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:51.445]  As many of the people in our government already know, we're in the midst of World War 4.
[00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:55.822]  World War 3, of course, is what the CIA called the Cold War.
[00:06:56.322 --> 00:07:02.683]  World War 4 is by megacorporations against individual nations and the family and the human biological system itself.
[00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:12.986]  It is a complete technotronic, technocracy, genetic takeover of the planet itself, in the words of Google and the other technocrats.
[00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:18.927]  They are planning to fully implode the third world nations that they control.
[00:07:19.928 --> 00:07:21.728]  They've been exploding for decades.
[00:07:24.872 --> 00:07:50.061]  They have put in policies in the third world to double their populations and then deploy those populations against the West in a giant cloud and piven type program to bankrupt the social compact and bring the world back into a new dark age of collapsed austerity and starvation that will depopulate at least 80% of the earth.
[00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:52.642]  There will then be a de-evolution
[00:07:53.422 --> 00:08:04.253]  To city-states, corporate city-states, corporate islands, that will be high-tech, breakaway civilization, Oasis.
[00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:09.778]  Now, I've been telling viewers and listeners about this for 20 plus years, because it's in the Globalist White Papers.
[00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:14.523]  But we're here now, and they are executing the operation.
[00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:28.869]  But, their operation is being executed while sane individuals in our governments, in corporations, and in government, military, private life,
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.804]  Have seen enough of the plan, they know how bad it is, they've known about it for a long time, but they've been bullied, intimidated, attacked.
[00:08:36.404 --> 00:08:49.434]  So, patriots, in the last few decades, have gone out and recruited and started organizations around the world, like UKIP and others, and what Ron Paul and others did, to begin for the preparation and defense against the main globalist move.
[00:08:50.535 --> 00:08:53.497]  Which they always, again, would deny was happening, so we would be flat-footed.
[00:08:53.537 --> 00:08:56.099]  But we were not caught completely flat-footed.
[00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:59.561]  In fact, the globalists were caught flat-footed when they went to their main launch.
[00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:01.744]  Everything else has been preparation.
[00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:05.728]  So, we are here.
[00:09:07.229 --> 00:09:13.576]  And currently, the West is under total attack, using humanity.
[00:09:14.577 --> 00:09:21.944]  Using huge streams of desperate people, leaving collapsed, globalist-controlled systems, like Venezuela.
[00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:38.016]  Cuba, the collapsing Middle East, which again seven years ago Obama and Hillary on record triggered to collapse good governments, moderate governments, to destroy economic infrastructures in four different nations that were stabilizing all the Middle East and Africa.
[00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:45.461]  This is an admitted post-industrialization sabotage plan to then collapse Africa, collapse the Middle East,
[00:09:46.554 --> 00:09:57.522]  Use that for destabilization to begin to collapse the civil unrest into the stands, into Russia, into Asia, collapsing into Western Europe, collapsing in the United States, using Latin America.
[00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.643]  This is all a plan.
[00:10:00.444 --> 00:10:03.226]  And Ronald Reagan was briefed on the plan in 19...
[00:10:06.118 --> 00:10:06.439]  I don't
[00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:34.649]  Use giant third world populations that they would bring into the U.S., turn against the U.S., have them racially identify against whites, and then basically have a weatherman style, you've seen the tapes of the weatherman talking about having a collapse, and then having a race war in America that then allows the U.N.
[00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:35.929]  to come in to stabilize things.
[00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:40.491]  Well, we've now seen a replay of that plan.
[00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:51.512]  We've now seen that, and the left and PBS went, oh my God, look, FEMA camps, Rex 84, to put whole families in these things.
[00:10:51.873 --> 00:10:59.879]  And even back when I was first waking up, people would deny that that was real, but I knew it was in government documents and congressional hearings that I'd read about in newspapers.
[00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:05.744]  It wasn't until years later I actually saw the video that had been on C-SPAN years before that I'd missed, that somebody had archived.
[00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:15.148]  And so then I realized that Reagan wasn't perked by any yardstick, but they put in Rex 84 to activate US military bases.
[00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:28.522]  If we got hit with 25 million people, if Latin America collapsed, as part of a globalist communist plot, that they would have to then house all these people and not let the disruption be triggered to then burn down cities and bring in
[00:11:29.463 --> 00:11:33.965]  The leftist breakdown of society and civil unrest that they wanted for a civil war.
[00:11:34.806 --> 00:11:39.188]  You can go read synopses in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Miami Herald of Rex 84.
[00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:41.329]  Much of it's been declassified.
[00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:44.750]  Garden plot, cable splicer.
[00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:49.793]  And then if you read the news today, you see Trump is implementing the beginning stages of Rex 84.
[00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:54.595]  And it would be called Rex 2018 or Rex 18 today.
[00:11:55.035 --> 00:11:58.097]  So Trump has implemented, probably has the same name, Rex 18.
[00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:02.530]  And again, it shows how you learn things as you get older.
[00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.770]  That is a U.S.
[00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.391]  stabilization emergency program.
[00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:15.158]  And it's an active measure preparation training scenario that they've been carrying out at least since 1984 that has now gone live.
[00:12:15.618 --> 00:12:18.320]  Now, it's not martial law as the left advertised it.
[00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.263]  And again, this showed how I didn't understand when I was reading 25 years ago.
[00:12:22.923 --> 00:12:25.305]  This was the preparation if they tried to have a civil war.
[00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:31.221]  To simply be able to house the giant populations during a collapse event.
[00:12:31.562 --> 00:12:51.636]  The same thing they're doing in Europe, bringing in over 10 million military-age men, building the migrant bases, inviting everyone in to collapse the borders, to collapse the social safety net, so the UN can come in and announce an emergency reorganization of the EU, an emergency reorganization of North America, which is in Reuters today!
[00:12:52.987 --> 00:13:00.274]  So again, there's thousands of angles and points, but I'm trying to give a condensed synopsis of this, and then the most important point when we come back from break.
[00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:17.934]  I'm mainly briefing the general public at this point.
[00:13:18.014 --> 00:13:19.575]  The president knows all this, obviously.
[00:13:20.035 --> 00:13:42.865]  What has to be understood is the Democrats, by their action, their body language, their telecommunications, their signals, their demeanor, and their previous activity indicating future activity, and all of their preparations show that Antifa has withdrawn and is prepping for assassinations, brutal attacks.
[00:13:43.245 --> 00:13:43.806]  They're going to hit.
[00:13:43.826 --> 00:13:44.566]  They're going to hit hard.
[00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:47.075]  They are preparing arson.
[00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:48.696]  They're preparing to attack police stations.
[00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:54.799]  They're just the front for other more professional paramilitary teams that are going to be in behind them.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.621]  They're just the throwaway decoys.
[00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:04.946]  And as of now, the deep state, the globalists, and you see it everywhere, are preparing the atmosphere
[00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:18.476]  By the middle of August, late August, unless we get the word out and back them down and stop them, they're going to trigger from soft civil war to real civil war, and then Mueller
[00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:35.577]  In September is going to begin a WikiLeaks type cascade where he begins to dribble out fake news and disinfo about Trump being a Russian agent, corruption, women scandals, you know, Roger Stone stuff, Alex Jones stuff.
[00:14:35.597 --> 00:14:36.537]  He's joining us behind the hour.
[00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:38.238]  Exclusive what they're now looking into.
[00:14:38.258 --> 00:14:40.859]  My filmmaking, Joel Gilbert's filmmaking.
[00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:43.840]  The FBI is considering saying our films are criminal.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.961]  And her political speech that are criminal.
[00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:47.542]  They already tried to charge Gilbert before.
[00:14:47.562 --> 00:14:48.303]  Remember three years ago?
[00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:50.284]  Saying he violated campaign finance law.
[00:14:51.104 --> 00:14:53.506]  So they're looking at criminal charges against me.
[00:14:54.066 --> 00:14:59.430]  And you have to understand, this will be during martial law in burning cities and Trump being assassinated or being forced to step down.
[00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.671]  So you're like, well that'll never happen.
[00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:02.132]  No, no.
[00:15:02.352 --> 00:15:05.454]  They're getting the charges and everything lined up for thousands of people.
[00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:07.935]  And a lot of us will just get hit at 3am.
[00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:14.211]  So I'm telling you, they're going to begin triggering in August, maybe even earlier because we're exposing it.
[00:15:15.032 --> 00:15:17.455]  And it's not launching well, it's not going well right now.
[00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:23.121]  Then by September, middle of September, they're going to start releasing all the stuff on Trump.
[00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:24.262]  It was a hoax!
[00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:59.614]  Uh, coming up in September into October, and they'll either try to have them via the 25th Amendment, as they've already announced, have Trump stand down and have his cabinet turn against him, and if that doesn't work, they will probably blow up the White House or shoot down his aircraft.
[00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:03.555]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:05.315]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:08.576]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[00:19:03.595 --> 00:19:05.016]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:06.497]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:06.557 --> 00:19:06.917]  Go ahead.
[00:19:07.037 --> 00:19:07.318]  Yes.
[00:19:07.758 --> 00:19:08.458]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:14.783]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:14.983 --> 00:19:18.966]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:20.647]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:27.732]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.654]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:36.237]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:36.277 --> 00:19:44.102]  It's people like you that didn't fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:19:44.122 --> 00:19:49.946]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:55.389]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:58.471]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:07.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:27.479]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:29.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:34.382]  Now continuing with my emergency briefing to the planet.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.643]  And to all the patriots around the world and here in the U.S.
[00:20:38.663 --> 00:20:42.907]  that want to have prosperous nation states with true, open, free societies.
[00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:48.713]  We are witnessing the corporate world government assault on Europe, Australia, the U.K., the U.S.
[00:20:49.193 --> 00:20:50.635]  with hundreds of millions.
[00:20:51.894 --> 00:20:52.495]  of illegals.
[00:20:52.955 --> 00:20:58.099]  You've seen Macron talk about the leprosy of the West and the leprosy of nationalism.
[00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:06.526]  That's the president of France, and saying we're going to bring in 200 million people from the Middle East and Africa in the next decade.
[00:21:07.327 --> 00:21:09.168]  You're like, well that's almost the population of Europe.
[00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:11.691]  90% of them don't even ever get jobs.
[00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:15.474]  It's total economic warfare.
[00:21:17.475 --> 00:21:19.037]  Now, let me get back to the briefing here.
[00:21:20.223 --> 00:21:25.365]  And then I'm going to come back and go through all the documentation and all the evidence of it, but I'm giving you the boil down here.
[00:21:26.226 --> 00:21:44.173]  Remember a year ago, a year ago, I said Antifa is getting the names of federal law enforcement, especially ICE, and they're getting the names of conservative police and judges, and they are going to kill you if they are allowed to.
[00:21:45.293 --> 00:21:48.536]  And now Antifa has doxxed Chloe Given Inside Knowledge.
[00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:49.177]  And who is Antifa?
[00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:50.438]  They're government employees.
[00:21:50.719 --> 00:21:51.700]  People like Reality Winner.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.745]  They're tenured professors that go out in disguises and do this.
[00:21:56.885 --> 00:21:59.168]  And this has all just been preparation.
[00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:05.614]  And the real Antifa only puts their little meth-head decoys out while they watch the police and they watch the public.
[00:22:06.905 --> 00:22:21.615]  And so remember, a year ago I told you that, and I told you they were preparing it, and the New York Times said I was insane, and there was no call by Antifa to overthrow the government, even though they'd run a full-page ad in the New York Times saying, overthrow the president.
[00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:22.975]  Physically.
[00:22:24.697 --> 00:22:25.977]  You go, yeah, that was weird.
[00:22:27.218 --> 00:22:32.181]  Why did they do that, and then why did they deny it at the same time?
[00:22:32.221 --> 00:22:34.843]  Because you tell your people, get ready for war, gear up,
[00:22:37.196 --> 00:22:39.977]  But then when the other side starts getting ready, you go, oh, I'm not going to attack.
[00:22:40.437 --> 00:22:42.418]  That is a classic tactic.
[00:22:43.818 --> 00:22:48.200]  Because it gets enough people on the other side not to get prepared, not to get ready.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.760]  And I said they'd fail last year.
[00:22:50.301 --> 00:22:51.561]  And I said it was a beta test.
[00:22:52.521 --> 00:22:54.222]  That if they couldn't remove him politically,
[00:22:55.114 --> 00:22:57.915]  That they would do it physically with civil war.
[00:22:58.035 --> 00:22:59.175]  And now that's the word.
[00:22:59.976 --> 00:23:00.876]  The compound word.
[00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:01.896]  Civil war.
[00:23:02.397 --> 00:23:03.437]  You're hearing it everywhere.
[00:23:04.057 --> 00:23:06.858]  Top professors have come out now and said, no, we're in a civil war.
[00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:08.539]  We're not in the early stages.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.901]  And they're calling for more and more violence.
[00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:15.961]  So what does the president need to do?
[00:23:16.922 --> 00:23:18.842]  Well, the president's already doing what he has to.
[00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:22.824]  He's getting the emergency preparations ready to stabilize the government during this.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.181]  The police and military are being prepared for it.
[00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:35.243]  The problem is they have stacked the ranks of the FBI, particularly, and many city police departments with actual communists.
[00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:39.004]  I mean, Brennan voted on record.
[00:23:39.024 --> 00:23:45.326]  There's like Washington Post articles for the Communist Party back in the 70s and was admitted to the CIA because he was one.
[00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:46.306]  He's also a hobbyist.
[00:23:47.455 --> 00:23:54.122]  And that's the big piece of news here, is this article from January 10th of this year is the key to all of this.
[00:23:54.802 --> 00:24:08.276]  We have their battle plan here, 25 pages of it, from a brother of an Antifa individual who was able to capture the documents and we confirmed their authenticity.
[00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:10.338]  The media never covered this, they never challenged it.
[00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:30.322]  And it is how they were working with major police departments in blue cities, but only with the leadership, to allow Antifa to attack police, to allow them to burn and agitate to try to get urban black populations to burn down the cities.
[00:24:30.422 --> 00:24:31.263]  But they didn't do it.
[00:24:31.944 --> 00:24:32.704]  Everywhere they tried.
[00:24:33.145 --> 00:24:34.726]  You've been seeing Obama try this for a long time.
[00:24:34.947 --> 00:24:35.187]  This was 2015.
[00:24:37.423 --> 00:24:38.364]  And it's all the admissions.
[00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:39.585]  It's George Soros' group.
[00:24:40.005 --> 00:24:42.547]  His son, Alexander, is the general.
[00:24:43.928 --> 00:24:44.449]  He runs it.
[00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:45.429]  Read the documents.
[00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.373]  And it's how they stage this with the police.
[00:24:50.574 --> 00:24:52.455]  It's the action BW104-18-15.
[00:24:55.097 --> 00:24:56.138]  Now you want to go read this.
[00:24:57.699 --> 00:24:58.800]  You need to go understand this.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.262]  And it's all the places they targeted.
[00:25:01.643 --> 00:25:02.323]  It's what they did.
[00:25:02.363 --> 00:25:05.085]  This is criminal racketeering of the highest order.
[00:25:05.506 --> 00:25:06.967]  This is espionage against the country.
[00:25:08.345 --> 00:25:09.426]  It's Friends of Democracy.
[00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:18.155]  So, all of this has been a beta test, but now you see Netflix, every movie, every TV show about violence and uprisings and the Purge, where the U.S.
[00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:22.078]  Army is the KKK and wears Klan outfits and comes and kills black people.
[00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:28.264]  It's all to create a simulation of people's heads, into the summer, trying to get everybody angry.
[00:25:29.244 --> 00:25:33.748]  Trump did the right thing trying to defuse it, even though it looks like it gave them what they wanted.
[00:25:33.768 --> 00:25:36.931]  It defused it because he knew the children weren't being hurt.
[00:25:36.971 --> 00:25:38.633]  He knew very few were being separated.
[00:25:39.353 --> 00:25:42.256]  And so, he's trying to defuse them.
[00:25:42.736 --> 00:25:45.919]  He's doing the right moral thing, not luring them in to try this.
[00:25:47.521 --> 00:25:55.328]  But he's telling Maxine and others, watch out what you do, because I'm telling you, Mr. President and everybody else,
[00:25:56.351 --> 00:25:59.453]  They are going to try to kill you.
[00:25:59.953 --> 00:26:02.255]  And they're going to be threatening your family and trying to turn them.
[00:26:02.715 --> 00:26:04.296]  They are going to be threatening to kill your family.
[00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:06.377]  They are going to target your family.
[00:26:06.877 --> 00:26:08.078]  This is a globalist move.
[00:26:08.158 --> 00:26:10.039]  They don't care if it looks bad.
[00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:12.581]  They don't care how it looks.
[00:26:12.661 --> 00:26:14.902]  They are not going to let your family live.
[00:26:15.322 --> 00:26:19.265]  They are going to kill everybody in your family when they make their move.
[00:26:20.461 --> 00:26:22.502]  And so, they're going to go for broke.
[00:26:23.242 --> 00:26:24.943]  It's going to be like a Maoist purge.
[00:26:26.324 --> 00:26:40.311]  The weathermen that advised Obama, and it came out, of course, in congressional hearings, and Larry Grafwald and others exposed it, who infiltrated them, how they would do all of this back in the 70s was their plan, and now they were going to kill 25 million people and put 25 million more in camps.
[00:26:43.053 --> 00:26:46.995]  So, bottom line, they are going to try to execute this.
[00:26:49.127 --> 00:26:50.948]  They are going to try to execute this.
[00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:54.609]  And the Justice Department has been captured.
[00:26:55.209 --> 00:26:57.369]  Rosenstein's a globalist operative, that's been proven.
[00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.610]  For whatever reason, Sessions is compromised.
[00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:06.352]  Or they would have already moved on Soros and his son when we got the criminal proof of what they did.
[00:27:10.473 --> 00:27:14.294]  Instead, we've got the tech giants and everybody else trying to side with the globalists.
[00:27:17.557 --> 00:27:20.539]  And you've got all these cowards that think they can appease both sides.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.403]  So people are telling Trump what he wants to hear about fixing the country and turning it around and not wrecking everything.
[00:27:27.084 --> 00:27:31.187]  And other folks are then, out of the other side of their mouth, going along with the plotters.
[00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:32.247]  But I know this.
[00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:42.695]  Brennan and all these other people, Clapper, Hayden, Hillary, you guys only hope
[00:27:44.136 --> 00:27:48.759]  Is to not execute this, because you'll never, never get away with it.
[00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:51.901]  But that's why they go on TV and say he'll be dead soon, he'll be out soon.
[00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:54.843]  This is triggering their people inside the deep state.
[00:27:55.203 --> 00:27:56.383]  Hold on, we're gonna win.
[00:27:56.524 --> 00:27:58.004]  All they do is put on a confidence act.
[00:27:58.245 --> 00:27:58.845]  They're losing.
[00:27:58.865 --> 00:27:59.886]  The economy's coming back.
[00:28:00.986 --> 00:28:02.087]  The sovereignty's coming back.
[00:28:02.907 --> 00:28:05.409]  Poll numbers for Trump with black Americans are doubling.
[00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.810]  Thousands of factories are coming back in.
[00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:09.772]  Hollywood's imploding.
[00:28:10.652 --> 00:28:13.293]  Secret technologies for life extension are beginning to be released.
[00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:14.354]  Medical breakthroughs.
[00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:17.015]  We've got a guy in there really trying to fix things.
[00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:30.300]  And why wouldn't there be some elements of the establishment that didn't want to have a giant globalist orchestrated Mao-style communist operating system for megabanks to totally shred the country and re-educate the U.S.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.962]  as if you'll ever win when America's whole ethos is about fighting empires and digging in
[00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:41.807]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, you will be destroyed.
[00:28:42.427 --> 00:28:49.493]  I don't care if you guys think you're going to sit there in Hawaii or sit over there in Tasmania or Switzerland and escape this.
[00:28:50.934 --> 00:28:55.457]  I mean, you are playing a game of chicken and we're not going to turn off the road either.
[00:28:55.898 --> 00:29:00.121]  So it's coming down to this, toe-to-toe battle with the globalists and the final battle for the republic.
[00:29:01.477 --> 00:29:08.479]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:15.282]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[00:29:15.942 --> 00:29:21.744]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:29.587]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.041]  Television over phone lines.
[00:29:32.322 --> 00:29:34.504]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[00:29:34.984 --> 00:29:40.869]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:46.234]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[00:29:46.835 --> 00:29:51.098]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:52.900]  This is very, very exciting.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.583]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[00:29:57.544 --> 00:30:18.740]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope, not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:21.863]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[00:30:22.523 --> 00:30:26.327]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[00:30:26.347 --> 00:30:28.409]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:44.666]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune in to Phonoscope and also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[00:30:45.226 --> 00:30:45.567]  So again,
[00:30:46.047 --> 00:30:51.038]  For myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:53.062]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[00:30:53.342 --> 00:30:54.765]  You've helped make America great again.
[00:30:56.363 --> 00:31:00.347]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[00:31:00.947 --> 00:31:04.130]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.911]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:31:06.392 --> 00:31:17.922]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:31:18.622 --> 00:31:23.707]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[00:31:24.087 --> 00:31:27.510]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:33.756]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:31:33.776 --> 00:31:38.640]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:41.463]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:31:41.823 --> 00:31:43.164]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:31:43.564 --> 00:31:48.449]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:53.155]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:31:53.255 --> 00:31:55.418]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:31:55.939 --> 00:32:00.826]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:06.365]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:32:06.385 --> 00:32:06.886]  Thanks for holding.
[00:32:06.946 --> 00:32:07.887]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:32:08.387 --> 00:32:11.930]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:25.262]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and
[00:32:25.282 --> 00:32:28.923]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[00:32:29.023 --> 00:32:35.864]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body.
[00:32:35.884 --> 00:32:36.724]  It's all amazing.
[00:32:36.764 --> 00:32:37.465]  Thank you, brother.
[00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:46.066]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:32:46.126 --> 00:32:50.887]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:32:51.007 --> 00:32:53.848]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[00:32:54.068 --> 00:32:57.369]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.929]  1776 Worldwide.
[00:33:04.592 --> 00:33:07.233]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.331 --> 00:33:33.831]  We are back.
[00:33:34.932 --> 00:33:37.954]  And I was laying out the fact that we are in the middle of World War 4.
[00:33:38.555 --> 00:33:53.825]  Powerful multinational corporations are hell-bent on bringing down nation-states and capturing the jewels of global control of the West, and then deploying that wealth, that technological prowess, into establishing the first true corporate planetary government.
[00:33:54.406 --> 00:33:57.928]  And to do that, third-world populations are being used as weapons to break down our borders.
[00:33:58.589 --> 00:33:59.610]  They intend to then bring in
[00:34:00.879 --> 00:34:09.440]  A race-based, ethnic-based, culture-based civil war, in the Democrats' own words, and then they intend to target
[00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:14.788]  And physically attack Republicans, Christians, Conservatives, Patriots, Nationalists.
[00:34:15.289 --> 00:34:33.335]  There was a big video from Steve McQueen's The Great Escape going around, I'll show later, on Twitter last night with Democrats' prominent Twitter accounts saying, I shot a whole video on it, saying, oh, you're lucky we just ran Sanders out of the restaurant and chased her down the street and chased her into another store.
[00:34:34.778 --> 00:34:35.058]  No, no.
[00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:44.722]  This is what's going to be happening to you, and it shows Nazis at a French cafe in the greatest state being machine-gunned.
[00:34:44.742 --> 00:34:44.922]  M.S.
[00:34:44.962 --> 00:34:45.662]  Bellows Jr.
[00:34:45.682 --> 00:34:48.043]  was one of the ones tweeting it, said, I got asked to leave.
[00:34:48.183 --> 00:34:48.684]  It's nothing.
[00:34:49.164 --> 00:34:52.085]  Here's how the Trump administration officials will be treated at restaurants.
[00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:54.306]  If we don't stop them now, they should thank us.
[00:34:54.946 --> 00:35:00.869]  And that's what the antifa are, the professors and the corporate people that are part of the left.
[00:35:00.949 --> 00:35:01.449]  And they are
[00:35:03.058 --> 00:35:09.619]  I know the biggest gun shops in town, and they've asked me not to particularly get into what place they are, but I can quote them.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:17.061]  They said, listen, our biggest business now is leftists, and they're in there training how to use firearms, saying they're getting ready for civil war.
[00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:18.981]  This has been going on for a year.
[00:35:20.842 --> 00:35:23.542]  And it's not lost on them, though, that they want my guns, but they can have guns.
[00:35:23.582 --> 00:35:24.523]  See why I have my guns?
[00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:30.944]  It's for deranged lunatics like you, and you've got hashtag hunt Republicans, and the year anniversary of Scalise getting shot, and you've got
[00:35:31.926 --> 00:35:44.212]  Crazy Maxine Waters putting the talking point out like Donny Deutch and like Pete Ofonda saying kidnap Baron, put him in a cage, burn down the facilities.
[00:35:44.252 --> 00:35:47.434]  You've got the doxing of the ICE agents by Antifa.
[00:35:47.774 --> 00:35:50.515]  That's by federal stay-behind-network agents.
[00:35:50.616 --> 00:35:51.016]  I told you.
[00:35:51.696 --> 00:35:53.518]  They've already got the Office of Personnel Management.
[00:35:53.778 --> 00:35:55.660]  Obama gave that to the leftists.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.622]  They've got all your houses, where you live, where you're at.
[00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:01.285]  They've got access to the databases to track you.
[00:36:01.465 --> 00:36:03.307]  They're in the NSA database.
[00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:15.939]  They have put hundreds of thousands of their own people, like Reality Winner, a member of ISIS, a person that said all whites should be genocided, a crazy white woman, was let in to run super high-level security clearances.
[00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:17.820]  Some of the highest clearance you can get.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.262]  She was hired because she was a fruitcake, lunatic, evil person!
[00:36:23.083 --> 00:36:28.386]  Because she would start a war with the American people and burn down prosperity and create racial division!
[00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.427]  Because she was a bad person!
[00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:39.912]  Now I'm gonna go over all the background on this and show you the articles, the documents, RECS 84, everything that ties together to this.
[00:36:40.873 --> 00:36:44.315]  And I didn't sit there and say those terrible things they're planning to do with the President, which they've said they'll do.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.841]  Just to hype things up, this is their move.
[00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:56.167]  And the globalists are planning a complete overthrow of America.
[00:36:56.227 --> 00:36:57.328]  It's their only shot now.
[00:36:57.688 --> 00:36:58.609]  And the same thing in Europe.
[00:36:59.049 --> 00:37:00.511]  And hundreds of millions from the third world.
[00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.712]  This is happening.
[00:37:02.252 --> 00:37:04.594]  The UN is announcing it's taking control of the Euro.
[00:37:05.055 --> 00:37:06.856]  It's announcing it's taking control of the military.
[00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:08.178]  That's Reuters!
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.043]  Nancy Pelosi and Loretta Lynch said they were going to bring in
[00:37:17.504 --> 00:37:19.686]  UN officials to run local police departments.
[00:37:19.726 --> 00:37:21.127]  Remember when Hillary got in office?
[00:37:21.287 --> 00:37:22.007]  But it didn't happen.
[00:37:23.688 --> 00:37:25.730]  But they're still moving forward.
[00:37:27.403 --> 00:37:34.725]  Now, I'm going to go over all of it, but now people are finally listening, because top professors are going, we're not going to see a civil war, we're in one.
[00:37:35.285 --> 00:37:41.027]  So let's be honest, and then let's talk about, later in the next hour, what do we do as solutions to counter this?
[00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:49.150]  Well, you understand that they're going to try to cause a civil unrest, race-based, Democrat versus Republican civil war.
[00:37:49.850 --> 00:38:01.377]  That will be used to make Trump stand down and then the UN will come in for reconciliation and will arbitrate and will oversee the refugee centers which are the port of entry for the takedown of the country.
[00:38:01.437 --> 00:38:02.378]  This is global government.
[00:38:02.618 --> 00:38:04.119]  This is capitulation of America.
[00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:04.819]  This is war.
[00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:06.620]  This is their stated plan.
[00:38:08.321 --> 00:38:09.322]  Reuters today!
[00:38:11.917 --> 00:38:12.197]  Okay?
[00:38:12.497 --> 00:38:16.540]  UN to present plan for Mediterranean migrant centers for the EU.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.184]  EU announces a EU army to not let nations leave and to make nations let the, quote, migrants in.
[00:38:26.166 --> 00:38:28.548]  It's all here, but you've got patriots getting elected everywhere.
[00:38:28.588 --> 00:38:29.929]  The tide's turning against them.
[00:38:30.209 --> 00:38:31.610]  The blue states are all collapsing.
[00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.450]  People are fleeing.
[00:38:33.031 --> 00:38:34.071]  Merkel's in deep trouble.
[00:38:34.892 --> 00:38:37.774]  They don't know what to do, so they're going to move their timetable up.
[00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:42.672]  They're activating the colleges, they're activating the Antifa, they're activating the violent groups.
[00:38:43.192 --> 00:38:46.013]  Antifa's saying they've got targets picked out in every city of who they're going to kill.
[00:38:46.273 --> 00:38:48.793]  They're just the cover for more serious hit teams.
[00:38:49.934 --> 00:39:00.176]  And then during all the unrest, if they can get rid of Trump, or remove him, or kill him, or have a 25th Amendment, which again, Clapper and Brennan are on TV saying, the cabinet must remove him now!
[00:39:00.596 --> 00:39:03.457]  We must take him out now, if that doesn't happen by October.
[00:39:04.557 --> 00:39:06.318]  Because they know they're about to lose in a red wave.
[00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.991]  Then they are going to try to kill the president.
[00:39:14.712 --> 00:39:16.692]  And I'm telling you, they know they're going to lose.
[00:39:16.712 --> 00:39:17.773]  They know everybody's turning against them.
[00:39:18.033 --> 00:39:21.714]  They know that the poll numbers are even way better than what they're saying.
[00:39:22.174 --> 00:39:24.955]  And they are in Hitler's bunker, basically.
[00:39:25.015 --> 00:39:27.356]  But we could let them manipulate us.
[00:39:30.225 --> 00:39:37.194]  And so this country and the world, this is a global system we're fighting, is on the razor's edge right now.
[00:39:41.607 --> 00:39:53.890]  Information about the latest dragnet of Mr. Mueller and Rosenstein committing violations of the government regulations that are very, very serious that he's discovered.
[00:39:54.530 --> 00:40:00.431]  And some other huge developments on the dragnet targeting Joel Gilbert, myself, and other filmmakers.
[00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:03.672]  So this is, they're looking into campaign finance now.
[00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:09.073]  They put Dinesh D'Souza in prison for nine months, saying he did something wrong on campaign finance.
[00:40:09.133 --> 00:40:10.774]  And they've already tried to arrest Gilbert.
[00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:17.078]  A few years ago, saying that films he mailed out to people during a campaign was campaign finance.
[00:40:17.358 --> 00:40:18.439]  You're like, well, that's crazy.
[00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:25.664]  But if they've got a civil war or martial law and Trump goes down, that'll be their excuse not to even kill us, but to arrest us.
[00:40:25.864 --> 00:40:27.405]  Then it'll all be nice, neat and tidy.
[00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.367]  So they've got a couple tracks going here.
[00:40:29.787 --> 00:40:33.250]  And so after Roger breaks this down, I'm going to ask him, what does the president do?
[00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.771]  Because it's a clear and present danger.
[00:40:35.112 --> 00:40:36.233]  They're doxing everybody.
[00:40:36.273 --> 00:40:37.273]  They're saying civil war.
[00:40:37.494 --> 00:40:39.255]  They're saying harass and intimidate people.
[00:40:39.515 --> 00:40:40.917]  Folks are getting attacked everywhere.
[00:40:40.937 --> 00:40:43.839]  And at a certain point, we can't just sit here.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.761]  It becomes a dereliction of duty.
[00:40:46.581 --> 00:40:48.303]  We have to move against these people.
[00:40:48.343 --> 00:40:50.785]  So, Roger, thank you for joining us with the exclusive info.
[00:40:50.805 --> 00:40:51.986]  We've got two minutes to break.
[00:40:52.226 --> 00:40:55.249]  Give us a synopsis and we'll come back and get it all out there.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.720]  Well, let's do it this way, Alex.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:07.863]  Yesterday, the former CIA official, Mr. Mudd, I think, gave away the game when he said, we're going to kill this guy, referring to Trump.
[00:41:08.343 --> 00:41:17.746]  We, meaning the CIA, the intelligence community, have been around for, you know, since the 1900s, and we're just going to kill this guy.
[00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:20.168]  I take that very seriously.
[00:41:20.268 --> 00:41:22.510]  I wrote a book on the Kennedy assassination.
[00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:32.138]  I know the role of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon and the FBI and the Secret Service in that coup d'etat.
[00:41:32.539 --> 00:41:36.662]  So I think Mr. Mudd has given away the game.
[00:41:37.043 --> 00:41:39.805]  That's exactly what they have in mind.
[00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:42.127]  Now, we're going to be called alarmists.
[00:41:42.207 --> 00:41:43.929]  We're going to be called extremists.
[00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:48.755]  We're going to be called conspiracy theorists because we point this out now.
[00:41:49.355 --> 00:41:59.188]  Also, right here on InfoWars, I predicted the 25th Amendment play by the establishment, and here we have it.
[00:41:59.728 --> 00:42:01.568]  Once again, InfoWars.
[00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:03.609]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:42:04.029 --> 00:42:05.389]  And it gets more insane.
[00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:13.751]  Mudd, I looked into his genealogy, it appears is related to Dr. Mudd, the only other person convicted of shooting Lincoln, of helping John Wilkes Booth.
[00:42:14.191 --> 00:42:22.633]  And so here is another guy calling for another death of a Republican president by assassination, and it appears he's the same family from Virginia.
[00:42:22.653 --> 00:42:23.933]  I couldn't trace it back to
[00:42:24.173 --> 00:42:32.547]  Because the records didn't go back, but it goes back to the same town, and he's definitely related, but I don't know if it's directly, to, uh, and that's where the, his name is Mudd.
[00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:34.310]  Comes from the trader Mudd.
[00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:35.352]  Can you believe that, Roger?
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.342]  It's amazing, Alex, and not a coincidence.
[00:42:41.002 --> 00:42:41.482]  Absolutely.
[00:42:41.522 --> 00:42:45.164]  I mean, this family has Republican bloodlust.
[00:42:45.484 --> 00:42:46.964]  They hate America, folks.
[00:42:47.104 --> 00:42:48.425]  And it's unbelievable.
[00:42:48.445 --> 00:42:48.865]  And here's the deal.
[00:42:49.265 --> 00:42:51.446]  I am honored to stand with Roger and the president and you.
[00:42:51.707 --> 00:42:52.267]  We're not bullying.
[00:42:52.287 --> 00:42:53.087]  We're not backing down.
[00:42:53.527 --> 00:42:54.348]  It's a game of chicken.
[00:42:54.608 --> 00:42:56.248]  And I am just pressing the accelerator down.
[00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:57.789]  And I'm going right down the center lane.
[00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:58.309]  And let's go.
[00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.010]  We're going to do it.
[00:42:59.050 --> 00:42:59.430]  Let's do it.
[00:43:07.259 --> 00:43:10.162]  What do you want to do with your life?
[00:43:10.882 --> 00:43:11.703]  I want to rock!
[00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:19.810]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:26.236]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:43:31.806 --> 00:43:36.187]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[00:43:37.388 --> 00:43:39.528]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[00:43:39.608 --> 00:43:41.469]  I could end this guy, Jack, tomorrow.
[00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:43.990]  All you gotta do is arm all your pests.
[00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:52.652]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[00:43:52.772 --> 00:43:53.432]  Where's the beef?
[00:43:53.792 --> 00:43:55.773]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[00:43:56.872 --> 00:44:00.035]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[00:44:00.055 --> 00:44:08.263]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[00:44:08.283 --> 00:44:13.788]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[00:44:14.288 --> 00:44:19.433]  And, in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:37.490]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:44.373]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[00:44:44.713 --> 00:44:45.834]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[00:44:46.095 --> 00:44:50.720]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.486]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[00:44:56.651 --> 00:45:01.054]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[00:45:01.354 --> 00:45:05.517]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[00:45:05.557 --> 00:45:08.379]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[00:45:08.419 --> 00:45:15.884]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[00:45:16.244 --> 00:45:20.467]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[00:45:20.867 --> 00:45:26.211]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[00:45:27.252 --> 00:45:28.413]  I'm scared of these people.
[00:45:29.114 --> 00:45:32.497]  I'm very scared of them.
[00:45:32.557 --> 00:45:38.562]  How do you think the crackpot gets into the country?
[00:45:38.582 --> 00:45:39.984]  We don't own any planes.
[00:45:40.444 --> 00:45:41.545]  We don't own no ships.
[00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:45.148]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:52.075]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[00:45:54.250 --> 00:46:01.616]  The men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[00:46:01.656 --> 00:46:06.620]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:13.725]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[00:46:14.166 --> 00:46:20.971]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-contras
[00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:26.734]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[00:46:27.514 --> 00:46:33.437]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowler Act.
[00:46:34.018 --> 00:46:39.020]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.402]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[00:46:42.942 --> 00:46:45.564]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:50.568]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[00:46:50.629 --> 00:46:50.889]  Lewinsky.
[00:46:51.449 --> 00:46:53.351]  These allegations are false.
[00:46:54.712 --> 00:47:00.238]  If you are resuming this transition, you are in existence.
[00:47:04.602 --> 00:47:07.225]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.015 --> 00:47:21.285]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:23.419 --> 00:47:29.142]  Well, you just heard Roger Stone, who has predicted everything that they would try to do to Trump, including the 25th Amendment move.
[00:47:29.202 --> 00:47:30.182]  He said that a year ago here.
[00:47:31.063 --> 00:47:32.704]  The whole Alzheimer's thing, all of it.
[00:47:32.944 --> 00:47:41.608]  And they are now openly saying, we're going to have civil war, we're going to harass Republicans and their families, we're going to harass any Trump voters, we're going to physically hurt them.
[00:47:41.708 --> 00:47:45.050]  Antifa is doxing federal law enforcement home addresses.
[00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.752]  They're saying target their families, that Hollywood stars.
[00:47:49.372 --> 00:47:56.434]  Hollywood turds are out there saying burn down their houses, attack them, kidnap their children.
[00:47:57.514 --> 00:47:59.495]  Donny Deutch is saying they're all Nazis.
[00:47:59.855 --> 00:48:06.477]  The Democrats are circulating video online of the great escape of Steve McQueen with their machine-gunning Nazis at a cafe.
[00:48:06.497 --> 00:48:09.018]  They say, this is what we're going to do to you in the cafes now.
[00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:12.179]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:48:12.499 --> 00:48:15.019]  And then I saw the comments last night when I showed that they were tweeting that.
[00:48:15.039 --> 00:48:16.460]  People were like, yeah, we're going to kill you.
[00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:18.450]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:19.630]  It's like James Woods said.
[00:48:20.191 --> 00:48:21.271]  Everybody's going to get armed.
[00:48:22.092 --> 00:48:22.912]  Who isn't already armed?
[00:48:22.932 --> 00:48:23.973]  Go out and get some more training.
[00:48:24.073 --> 00:48:24.853]  Watch our six.
[00:48:25.894 --> 00:48:29.616]  And if anything happens like this, we're going to fight back.
[00:48:31.017 --> 00:48:33.739]  So I appreciate Democrats being honest about what your intentions are.
[00:48:34.499 --> 00:48:37.741]  So, you know, if I have to defend myself, it's very, very clear who was the aggressor.
[00:48:41.726 --> 00:48:48.225]  I mean, I understand that Democratic constituents tend to be followers or mentally ill or have a lot of problems or be on the government mammary gland, but...
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.362]  I don't think they understand, like, threatening us isn't making us go away.
[00:48:52.382 --> 00:48:53.662]  It was kind of like Hitler bombing London.
[00:48:53.682 --> 00:48:54.723]  He thought it would make them give up.
[00:48:54.763 --> 00:48:56.664]  It made them go from being against the war for the war.
[00:48:57.144 --> 00:49:06.990]  Roger, you've got a lot of big breaking news here, but I need people to understand that you just concurred with me, and sometimes you disagree, but you just agreed that they are going to go to the mattresses.
[00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:08.871]  They know they're losing.
[00:49:09.531 --> 00:49:11.012]  You're saying you agree with my analysis.
[00:49:11.032 --> 00:49:12.713]  You can see the preparation everywhere.
[00:49:12.733 --> 00:49:16.695]  I mean, they say they're planning this, and I just don't know how the president doesn't move on them.
[00:49:16.895 --> 00:49:17.556]  I mean, I think that
[00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:20.357]  I think that he should probably fire the Attorney General.
[00:49:20.377 --> 00:49:21.097]  He should fire them all.
[00:49:21.537 --> 00:49:22.498]  He should put new people in.
[00:49:22.518 --> 00:49:25.039]  He should declare a civil emergency.
[00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:26.380]  Definitely the country's in one.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:33.162]  George Washington did that during his first term, and point out who the traitors are, because these aren't organic Americans that are doing this.
[00:49:33.182 --> 00:49:39.365]  These are people trying to overthrow the country, quarterbacked by the UN, trying to break our borders, trying to capture the country.
[00:49:39.405 --> 00:49:45.508]  This is our nation under attack, and I think the President has been very judicious and very restrained so far.
[00:49:46.048 --> 00:49:49.610]  And he's been turning the economy around, trying to get people to wake up and just be decent.
[00:49:50.251 --> 00:49:54.033]  But they've proven how evil they are, and they're just howling for his blood, my blood, your blood.
[00:49:54.653 --> 00:49:57.175]  And so we now move into survival mode against these people.
[00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:09.006]  Well, and their hysteria is only increased by a growing economy and by the disappearance of the polling edge that they seem to have in the upcoming elections.
[00:50:09.447 --> 00:50:11.729]  There will be no blue tidal wave.
[00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:14.572]  There may be a red tidal wave.
[00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:18.076]  Every day that goes by, the economy improves.
[00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:27.503]  They know that the President's personal and corporate income tax rates have not yet even had a chance to have their full positive effect.
[00:50:27.563 --> 00:50:34.068]  So things are only going to get bigger, better, and I think that strengthens the President's hand.
[00:50:34.128 --> 00:50:37.251]  And that's why the Democrats now admit they want to bankrupt the economy to stop us.
[00:50:37.291 --> 00:50:38.351]  I mean, they are the enemy!
[00:50:39.973 --> 00:50:45.497]  There's a piece up on Bloomberg today that says Robert Mueller is now going to focus on Russian collusion.
[00:50:46.192 --> 00:50:46.733]  Wait a minute.
[00:50:47.213 --> 00:50:50.977]  I thought that's what he was focusing on from the beginning.
[00:50:51.418 --> 00:51:06.154]  This nothing burger story ties together every non-crime, every allegation, every false or muted fact about the fact that there is no Russian collusion.
[00:51:06.534 --> 00:51:18.276]  It mentions the contact through Michael Caputo to me by Henry Greenberg, but it never mentions that Mr. Greenberg is an indisputable FBI informant.
[00:51:18.816 --> 00:51:23.857]  Really, Chris Strom and Shannon Pettypiece need to be ashamed of themselves.
[00:51:24.637 --> 00:51:26.038]  This is not journalism.
[00:51:26.638 --> 00:51:28.658]  This is an attempt to fraud.
[00:51:29.578 --> 00:51:30.139]  It really is.
[00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:31.259]  It is fraudulent.
[00:51:31.379 --> 00:51:32.379]  In my own case,
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:51.381]  As you know, Reuters, AP, others have reported that the FBI has interrogated, and in some cases subpoenaed, in other cases are attempting to subpoena, a number of my current and former associates and employees.
[00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:53.583]  Now, I know how this works.
[00:51:53.683 --> 00:51:55.225]  I've seen enough mob movies.
[00:51:55.665 --> 00:51:57.207]  You find the underlings.
[00:51:57.607 --> 00:51:59.649]  You find something they've done wrong.
[00:51:59.709 --> 00:52:02.973]  Let's say they didn't pay their federal income taxes.
[00:52:03.433 --> 00:52:10.681]  Now, you give them a walk on that charge in return for testifying against the big fish.
[00:52:11.221 --> 00:52:12.482]  That would be me.
[00:52:13.423 --> 00:52:22.591]  So we don't know what will happen, but we do know that the lead prosecutor investigating Roger Stone comes from the Baltimore U.S.
[00:52:22.651 --> 00:52:25.173]  Attorney's Office of Rod Rosenstein.
[00:52:26.056 --> 00:52:36.001]  That's interesting because Mr. Rosenstein, by regulation, is not supposed to be involved in the operations or staffing of the special counsel's office.
[00:52:36.521 --> 00:52:40.564]  So how this lawyer got his job, we don't know.
[00:52:41.084 --> 00:52:46.867]  But we do know that they will find no evidence of Russian collusion and Roger Stone.
[00:52:47.267 --> 00:52:50.889]  No evidence of WikiLeaks hijinks and Roger Stone.
[00:52:51.409 --> 00:52:56.832]  No evidence that I had or knowledge of John Podesta's email.
[00:52:56.892 --> 00:53:01.234]  I want to go back to this because I was just reading the Bloomberg article they put out and they think we have no memory.
[00:53:01.654 --> 00:53:02.515]  It's like we're goldfish.
[00:53:02.575 --> 00:53:06.177]  It says Mueller now for the first time focusing on Russia.
[00:53:07.077 --> 00:53:09.858]  And he's accelerating things.
[00:53:09.898 --> 00:53:11.938]  Yeah, because he knows they're about to lose the midterms.
[00:53:12.179 --> 00:53:14.819]  They thought they'd win the midterms, then have their impeachment.
[00:53:14.859 --> 00:53:28.603]  But instead, they're going to totally politically, right before, I'd say September, October, start releasing all the latest hoaxes, like Tom Arnold saying that Trump's lawyer told him he had all the dirt, which he admits was a total hoax.
[00:53:28.903 --> 00:53:30.464]  So I expect a bunch of those hoaxes.
[00:53:31.004 --> 00:53:34.848]  Well, and they're now examining the independent political operations of my independent efforts to elect Donald Trump.
[00:53:34.868 --> 00:53:36.690]  Specifically, the Committee for American Sovereignty.
[00:53:55.829 --> 00:54:08.932]  Which produced the documentary, Banished, the Danny Williams story, seen by 35 million Americans, which by the way, debuted right here on InfoWars.
[00:54:09.432 --> 00:54:16.913]  Also produced the Danny Williams rap video by the Freenauts, seen by 28 million people.
[00:54:17.134 --> 00:54:24.075]  And you played it and aired it and promoted ads in black urban areas, and many experts credit it for Trump winning.
[00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.030]  100% legal.
[00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:36.094]  But Joel Gilbert is now under the microscope, the incredible director of these videos.
[00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:39.055]  This is legal harassment.
[00:54:39.648 --> 00:54:44.191]  By a vengeful federal prosecutor with a partisan objective.
[00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:48.414]  I'm being targeted because I'm a friend of Donald Trump.
[00:54:49.014 --> 00:54:54.898]  I am being targeted because I have been effective in the election of Donald Trump.
[00:54:55.619 --> 00:54:57.280]  Is this Hillary's payback?
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.041]  I suspect it is.
[00:54:59.862 --> 00:55:03.284]  And Alex, I don't need to tell you, the cost is enormous.
[00:55:04.128 --> 00:55:11.375]  I want to thank the thousands of people who have sent contributions to my legal defense fund at stonedefense.com.
[00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:23.466]  I'm going to be bankrupt by this process, but I will not throw in the towel, and I will not quit, and I will not roll over, and I will not testify against the President.
[00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:26.629]  And there's nothing to testify about, as you've said.
[00:55:28.502 --> 00:55:32.384]  Well, see, they try to induce you to compose testimony.
[00:55:32.484 --> 00:55:34.745]  It's an age-old trick.
[00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:39.547]  Well, sure, but last time you were on, you pointed out you've done nothing wrong, and so you never testified against him.
[00:55:39.567 --> 00:55:42.988]  And then they said Stone admits he did something wrong, but he won't flip on the president.
[00:55:43.228 --> 00:55:45.009]  They are such incredible liars.
[00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:54.233]  And speaking of that, I didn't even plug one time yesterday, because I'm so upset about what's happening, and all the calls for violence, and the fact that we know they're going to make their civil unrest martial law
[00:55:55.502 --> 00:56:06.327]  Move and it's just a terrible situation, but I didn't even plug yesterday one time we have super blue fluoride free Toothpaste fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.

[00:57:52.179 --> 00:57:53.560]  Gregory, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:53.820]  Welcome.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.901]  Can I make a plug real quick about bodies?
[00:57:56.021 --> 00:57:57.201]  Like, it really did help.
[00:57:57.221 --> 00:57:57.422]  Please.
[00:57:57.442 --> 00:57:59.643]  I had, like, a real bad pain in my ear.
[00:57:59.663 --> 00:58:01.043]  I thought it was an ear infection.
[00:58:01.223 --> 00:58:04.965]  And it turned out to be a joint pain called TMJ.
[00:58:05.005 --> 00:58:05.906]  TMJ, I have it.
[00:58:05.946 --> 00:58:10.068]  And I just noticed one day, like, when I was eating, there was, like, a sharp pain.
[00:58:10.208 --> 00:58:12.369]  I thought, you know, I thought, OK, well, I might go away.
[00:58:12.409 --> 00:58:14.270]  The next two days, it just got worse.
[00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:15.110]  I'm like, you know what?
[00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:18.712]  I'm going to go to the doctor because I can't even go to sleep, and I can't even go to work right now.
[00:58:18.732 --> 00:58:20.333]  So, like, I went to the emergency room.
[00:58:21.013 --> 00:58:24.195]  They just told me, you know, uh, we really can't do anything.
[00:58:24.215 --> 00:58:26.437]  All we could do is just give you an antibiotic.
[00:58:26.577 --> 00:58:28.399]  And they were telling me, like, what it was.
[00:58:28.479 --> 00:58:33.402]  The thing he told me is, uh, that, like, you need to take Advil, because Advil has anti-inflammatories.
[00:58:33.422 --> 00:58:37.505]  So when I came home, I'm like, wait, I remember body has anti-inflammatories.
[00:58:37.525 --> 00:58:38.766]  So, like, I started reading it.
[00:58:38.866 --> 00:58:41.088]  And then, like, he said it's the best product.
[00:58:41.128 --> 00:58:42.209]  So I just wanted to try it.
[00:58:43.169 --> 00:58:43.729]  I took two.
[00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:45.090]  I just remember taking two.
[00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:46.610]  It didn't hurt that day.
[00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:50.191]  I mean, it was a little recurring, but let me tell you, like I said, it was last week.
[00:58:50.231 --> 00:58:52.492]  This whole week, I haven't, I don't even remember the pain.
[00:58:52.592 --> 00:58:53.152]  I really don't.
[00:58:53.272 --> 00:58:55.353]  Like, I just go about my business.
[00:58:55.453 --> 00:58:57.953]  Well, that's, I mean, that's what, that's what turmeric's known for.
[00:58:58.013 --> 00:59:00.634]  It's got a bunch of other compounds that are anti-inflammatories.
[00:59:00.794 --> 00:59:03.256]  It's Mother Nature, God gave it to us, and I'm glad you like bodies.
[00:59:03.296 --> 00:59:08.820]  I never really talk about products, and the FDA doesn't want people to even say what they can do, and no one talks about turmeric.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.862]  I mean, it's a known superfood.
[00:59:10.942 --> 00:59:13.323]  Well, the average turmeric's 3% curcumin, and ours is 95.
[00:59:14.184 --> 00:59:19.348]  We set out to find the best concentrated system of it in the world.
[00:59:20.931 --> 00:59:27.836]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:59:28.076 --> 00:59:37.802]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:59:37.862 --> 00:59:40.844]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:59:41.105 --> 00:59:42.345]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:59:42.746 --> 00:59:50.211]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:55.095 --> 01:00:01.001]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.061 --> 01:00:03.584]  We are drugged out!
[01:00:04.185 --> 01:00:06.507]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:09.870]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:11.992]  Today, it all changes.
[01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:14.834]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:00:15.054 --> 01:00:17.895]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:22.638]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:00:22.879 --> 01:00:25.520]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.042]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:00:28.222 --> 01:00:30.343]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:00:30.803 --> 01:00:32.224]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:00:32.444 --> 01:00:33.285]  We have the resources.
[01:00:36.374 --> 01:00:40.436]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[01:00:40.476 --> 01:00:41.817]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:00:41.997 --> 01:00:43.557]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:00:43.597 --> 01:00:44.478]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:00:44.678 --> 01:00:45.578]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:00:45.758 --> 01:00:47.979]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:00:48.139 --> 01:00:51.761]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:56.863]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:57.424 --> 01:00:59.245]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:01:00.665 --> 01:01:04.387]  And now The Left's favorite director, Mr. Lynch, has come out in support of Trump.
[01:01:06.156 --> 01:01:14.203]  Every other left icon, Morrissey, the list goes on and on, anybody that is really about prosperity in the future knows that Trump's a good guy.
[01:01:15.003 --> 01:01:21.929]  But the globalists, Brennan, others whose specialty is overthrowing countries, admit they're trying to overthrow the president and the electoral process.
[01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:23.770]  And so it's all public now.
[01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:26.672]  And we kept warning of this and warning, now they're public.
[01:01:26.712 --> 01:01:29.194]  Roger, what does the president need to do?
[01:01:29.655 --> 01:01:32.257]  I mean, if we don't talk about how we respond to this,
[01:01:33.271 --> 01:01:44.547]  We don't want to get tricked into doing something too much, but at a certain point that becomes a mind game of its own because when they're already going hot on you, I think the big thing is people need to know how serious this is so they don't get the jump on us.
[01:01:45.088 --> 01:01:48.713]  They are planning at the end of the summer, end of the fall,
[01:01:49.554 --> 01:01:56.919]  To basically trigger civil unrest and the assassination of the president and a total political shutdown.
[01:01:56.939 --> 01:02:08.646]  They're also pre-programming, I've noticed, in Bloomberg and McClatchy and everywhere now, that the Russians are claiming that people want to overthrow Trump and that the Russians are claiming the little girl really wasn't hurt.
[01:02:09.465 --> 01:02:19.811]  When the Russians are claiming that the left wants to sow civil war, when the Russians have nothing to do with it, they're the ones doing it, so that when we're saying, hey, this is bad, don't do it, they're going to say, that's Russia propaganda too.
[01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:24.673]  I mean, hell, if, you know, I didn't cook my kids eggs right this morning, it was the Russians' fault.
[01:02:24.733 --> 01:02:27.675]  So, in the three minutes we have left, what does Trump need to do?
[01:02:29.456 --> 01:02:37.280]  Well, the single most important thing he could do today, right now, in the next hour, is to terminate the employment of Rod Rosenstein.
[01:02:37.862 --> 01:02:41.504]  Mr. Rosenstein certainly has grounds for termination.
[01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:45.486]  He has not turned over to the Congress what the Congress asked for.
[01:02:45.886 --> 01:02:50.209]  He has turned over substantially less than what the Congress asked for.
[01:02:50.649 --> 01:02:59.054]  He is the one who signed the surveillance authorization under a FISA warrant based on fraudulent information.
[01:02:59.994 --> 01:03:04.897]  Those two acts of treachery alone should merit his termination.
[01:03:05.898 --> 01:03:11.681]  We won the election, but the Deep State continues to control the Justice Department.
[01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:31.730]  The President cannot possibly combat the coming counter-revolution, the coming revolt to overturn the country in a coup without a Justice Department committed to the rule of law and the prosecution of those who plan to execute the violence.
[01:03:33.908 --> 01:03:35.649]  And Roger, you're completely right.
[01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:38.491]  That's why Mueller admits he's accelerating his fake Russia probe.
[01:03:40.172 --> 01:03:42.233]  It's because he understands the wheels are coming off.
[01:03:42.293 --> 01:03:44.055]  Rosenstein is absconding with evidence.
[01:03:44.415 --> 01:03:45.656]  He's violating federal rules.
[01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:49.798]  He's got his own picked lawyer after you that violates federal rules.
[01:03:50.699 --> 01:03:53.321]  He's got to go or Trump is in dereliction of duty.
[01:03:53.681 --> 01:03:55.722]  Trump is totally, completely innocent of all this.
[01:03:55.782 --> 01:03:56.382]  It's been proven.
[01:03:56.843 --> 01:04:02.967]  Rosenstein is a criminal coup plotter with Hillary, with McCabe, with Strzok, with all of these people.
[01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:10.035]  Uh, and Trump must move against the clear and present danger before they crash the economy, assassinate him, and start a race war.
[01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:11.397]  So, it's gotta be done.
[01:04:11.757 --> 01:04:14.140]  Rosenstein's gotta go, and I think the Attorney General does as well.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.462]  Gotta fire both of them.
[01:04:17.037 --> 01:04:17.437]  Amen.
[01:04:17.497 --> 01:04:18.938]  From your mouth to God's ear.
[01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:20.618]  It's gotta be done.
[01:04:20.678 --> 01:04:27.940]  He can't wait till Mueller comes up with all his fake garbage down the road and then just lets them continue to engage in criminal activity.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.661]  We have the proof.
[01:04:29.001 --> 01:04:30.301]  From the beginning, it was a frame-up.
[01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.242]  That means investigations are over.
[01:04:32.942 --> 01:04:36.663]  I cannot believe that Mueller has not had his arrogant ass thrown in prison yet.
[01:04:38.592 --> 01:04:39.333]  You know, it's amazing.
[01:04:39.393 --> 01:04:43.056]  I did an interview with The Hill, Alex, last week.
[01:04:43.476 --> 01:04:50.983]  And although I never used the word indict in my interview, their headline, Roger Stone expects to be indicted.
[01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:52.624]  Not what I said.
[01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:55.567]  Roger Stone expects to be framed.
[01:04:56.047 --> 01:04:57.328]  That's a real possibility.
[01:04:57.969 --> 01:04:58.510]  God bless you.
[01:04:58.530 --> 01:04:58.910]  We'll be back.

[01:06:06.483 --> 01:06:10.426]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell.
[01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:18.813]  People around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares, they're freaking out.
[01:06:19.013 --> 01:06:22.736]  Folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:06:29.245 --> 01:06:33.527]  I have two words for you.
[01:06:33.547 --> 01:06:34.947]  Let it rip, bro.
[01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:52.231]  Hey, you saw?
[01:06:52.251 --> 01:06:52.431]  Die.
[01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:54.151]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.771]  He said he and Hillary are demons.
[01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:56.392]  Said we smell like salt.
[01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:57.252]  Ain't that something?
[01:06:57.372 --> 01:06:58.052]  I'm not just being tacky.
[01:06:58.112 --> 01:06:59.412]  I'm calling Margaret Newton-Samoa.
[01:06:59.773 --> 01:07:02.073]  I have never seen or smelled anyone like her.
[01:07:02.113 --> 01:07:02.993]  Come on, let's do it!
[01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:37.027]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:07:37.788 --> 01:07:39.332]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:07:55.569 --> 01:08:01.393]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:25.191]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:33.234]  You think you're going to assassinate Trump, shoot down the infinity and bully a bunch of us into going along with you?
[01:08:35.294 --> 01:08:36.395]  I'd like to reserve power.
[01:08:36.455 --> 01:08:36.835]  No.
[01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:38.616]  How long from you willing to have a fight?
[01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:40.176]  Twenty-one at this point.
[01:08:40.356 --> 01:08:45.738]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW globalist George Soros droppings?
[01:08:45.838 --> 01:08:46.279]  Stabilizer.
[01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:46.959]  Emergency reserve.
[01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:52.421]  So to George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and the New World Order, and Michael Moore, go back to Haiti, where you came from.
[01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:57.240]  We're awake, and you're not putting us back in the coma!
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.721]  You got that, Jack?
[01:08:58.761 --> 01:08:59.441]  You're done!
[01:08:59.461 --> 01:09:00.081]  It's over!
[01:09:00.121 --> 01:09:00.701]  Worldwide!
[01:09:00.781 --> 01:09:01.661]  Get him back!
[01:09:02.422 --> 01:09:02.822]  Get him back!
[01:09:02.922 --> 01:09:10.984]  Do you think there was more than one shooter?
[01:09:11.024 --> 01:09:13.505]  Definitely another shooter.
[01:09:13.565 --> 01:09:14.785]  For sure, a second shooter.
[01:09:14.845 --> 01:09:18.586]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[01:09:18.606 --> 01:09:19.207]  Clear.
[01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:20.127]  What do you see?
[01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:24.754]  Alright, he is riding shotgun with us for the rest of the broadcast.
[01:09:25.715 --> 01:09:26.716]  He's The Amazing Lucas.
[01:09:26.936 --> 01:09:29.658]  Every one of his videos is really good, really informative.
[01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:33.722]  And he's a champion bodybuilder and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:09:34.323 --> 01:09:39.828]  And he's The Amazing Lucas on Instagram, at I'm The Amazing Lucas, YouTube The Amazing Lucas.
[01:09:40.329 --> 01:09:41.450]  And he just got involved
[01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:47.330]  In the last year or so because of all the stuff that he has seen.
[01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.832]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[01:09:49.293 --> 01:09:50.114]  Thank you for having me.
[01:09:50.795 --> 01:09:55.862]  Man, I tell you, what would you call the state of the nation right now?
[01:09:56.971 --> 01:09:57.611]  What would you call that?
[01:09:58.072 --> 01:10:00.854]  A hysterical, and it's manufactured hysteria.
[01:10:01.254 --> 01:10:02.215]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:10:02.896 --> 01:10:05.578]  Because everything from Maxine Waters, like, that's real.
[01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:14.645]  When it comes to the mob, and the thing is, many people were focusing on what she was saying, but if you really go back in time, they've always been saying some off-the-wall things.
[01:10:14.745 --> 01:10:16.766]  The only difference is, now people are cheering.
[01:10:18.407 --> 01:10:23.972]  And once you had Tommy Loring and water thrown in her face, it's only a matter of time that water becomes acid.
[01:10:25.899 --> 01:10:26.379]  Well said.
[01:10:26.399 --> 01:10:30.701]  I mean, I've experienced hot coffee dumped on my face.
[01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:33.241]  I've experienced people knocking my food over at the restaurant.
[01:10:34.122 --> 01:10:36.422]  And they call you a Russian agent or a Nazi.
[01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:39.023]  It's like calling me a space alien.
[01:10:39.103 --> 01:10:40.844]  And so a lot of times I laugh at them and they get mad.
[01:10:41.778 --> 01:10:44.720]  But a lot of people, it's not funny to them, but they'll do it in front of your kids, too.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.641]  Yeah, because that's what they actually believe.
[01:10:46.901 --> 01:10:49.263]  They've been brainwashed into believing that you're Nazis.
[01:10:49.623 --> 01:10:53.826]  So if you actually believe that someone is a Nazi, well, I'd be right there with them.
[01:10:53.926 --> 01:10:55.787]  I'd be like, yo, we need to get these Nazis out of here.
[01:10:56.048 --> 01:10:57.669]  These bigots, these homophobes, these xenophobes.
[01:10:57.989 --> 01:11:00.110]  All these words to censor people.
[01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.572]  And it's a process of dehumanization.
[01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.373]  You know, it's funny you bring that up.
[01:11:04.433 --> 01:11:06.374]  Guys, can you pull up the Great Escape clip?
[01:11:07.075 --> 01:11:11.098]  And then also, he removed it off his Twitter, but it had been retweeted thousands of times.
[01:11:12.819 --> 01:11:17.801]  The Democrats were sharing this last night, but first, if we can, I want to actually show the tweet.
[01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:18.281]  We saved it.
[01:11:19.002 --> 01:11:28.126]  The Democrats were tweeting this all over the place, and I learned about it from some of the crew here who had it tweeted at them.
[01:11:29.187 --> 01:11:32.408]  They had it tweeted at them, and this is M.S.
[01:11:32.708 --> 01:11:33.208]  Bellows, Jr.
[01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:36.591]  I got asked to leave is nothing.
[01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:40.852]  Here's how Trump administration officials will be treated at restaurants if we don't stop them now.
[01:11:41.332 --> 01:11:47.094]  And it's Steve McQueen, who by the way was good buddies with Chuck Norris and would be a patriot today if he was alive.
[01:11:47.114 --> 01:11:51.936]  A lot of people that knew him, he was like Americana, you know, red, white, and blue, would love Trump.
[01:11:52.216 --> 01:11:55.137]  And of course, we're the Americans that beat the Nazis, remember?
[01:11:55.257 --> 01:12:03.280]  But in the new leftist program, when they're funded by George Soros, a literal former Nazi collaborator, in his own words, on 60 Minutes, they have this guy
[01:12:04.622 --> 01:12:04.762]  But, uh,
[01:12:35.831 --> 01:12:36.211]  Let's see.
[01:12:38.093 --> 01:12:38.814]  Hello?
[01:12:40.876 --> 01:12:41.116]  Hello?
[01:12:55.388 --> 01:12:56.870]  Car pulls up to the outside cafe.
[01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:09.263]  And they talk about, oh, are we in the French Resistance?
[01:13:09.323 --> 01:13:09.924]  Oh, yeah, we are.
[01:13:09.944 --> 01:13:11.265]  They all have a drink together.
[01:13:12.066 --> 01:13:20.777]  So, you have the left that's anti-gunned, as you know, which end of it shoots, fantasizing about all this, and saying, kill the president's family, kidnap his son.
[01:13:21.618 --> 01:13:24.801]  The amazing Lucas, again, is here with us in studio.
[01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:28.338]  When do they stop her?
[01:13:28.378 --> 01:13:29.139]  How far does this go?
[01:13:29.479 --> 01:13:30.060]  They won't stop.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.181]  They absolutely won't stop.
[01:13:31.201 --> 01:13:35.486]  Because what they won't allow to happen is a repeat of what happened in 2016.
[01:13:36.087 --> 01:13:37.749]  And I don't think a lot of people understand that.
[01:13:37.809 --> 01:13:40.892]  What we're seeing is just, it's the tipping point.
[01:13:41.433 --> 01:13:46.398]  And while they're figuring out and re-strategizing right now, this is a time that we need to consolidate.
[01:13:47.273 --> 01:13:51.894]  And plan for 2019, 2020, because what they're planning for is 2030, 2044.
[01:13:54.135 --> 01:13:58.236]  So we have to join our forces together and really figure it out.
[01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:08.598]  And we've got to reach out across racial and cultural lines because they are sowing classical race-based garbage and then to play a demographic number to steal the American dream.
[01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:09.638]  It's so cold-blooded.
[01:14:09.698 --> 01:14:10.579]  It absolutely is.
[01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.321]  What the left touches, they destroy.
[01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:27.230]  And for people who don't believe that, you can look at the black community, everything from separating fathers with the welfare, to putting Planned Parenthoods in the communities, to presently right now saying voter IDs, it's racist, it's racist.
[01:14:27.451 --> 01:14:28.712]  We all know that's not the case.
[01:14:28.912 --> 01:14:30.173]  You want the votes from the legals.
[01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:36.457]  But what the frightening part is, what should be alarming to people right now, is that they have their eyes on America.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.982]  That should be the frightening part, because guess what?
[01:14:40.322 --> 01:14:43.224]  That affects you, that affects me, that affects everyone.
[01:14:44.005 --> 01:14:46.226]  And that's why you need to pick up and fight.
[01:14:46.246 --> 01:14:48.368]  And I'm not saying incite violence, but you need to fight.
[01:14:48.768 --> 01:14:52.050]  And you know, no pun intended, but it is an information war.
[01:14:53.411 --> 01:15:02.658]  When I look at how they are just cold-bloodedly pushing lies, and they get worse and worse and worse,
[01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:09.791]  I don't see how they succeed, but at the same time, I see a lot of Republicans becoming intimidated by it.
[01:15:09.831 --> 01:15:13.895]  I mean, if they don't start standing up to this, these people could win.
[01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:14.576]  Absolutely.
[01:15:14.596 --> 01:15:18.879]  As I told you time and time again, if you don't stand up, they will consume you.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.582]  If you cower, they will consume you.
[01:15:22.699 --> 01:15:25.222]  Amazing Lucas, we're going to cover the waterfront when we come back.
[01:15:25.283 --> 01:15:26.304]  A bunch of breaking news.
[01:15:26.364 --> 01:15:28.807]  Trump's statement on the Supreme Court ruling in his favor.
[01:15:29.468 --> 01:15:31.271]  All of it, but it's really true.
[01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:34.855]  If you look at every blue state, every blue city, everyone is in exodus.
[01:15:35.436 --> 01:15:38.620]  The elites that are in charge always are tax exempt and don't even really live there.
[01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:39.942]  And it's true!
[01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:43.645]  I mean, what you said is everything they touch turns to crap.
[01:15:43.986 --> 01:15:47.209]  Why in the world would we want these people running things?
[01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:51.773]  TheAmazingLucas, at I am TheAmazingLucas on Twitter, be sure and follow him.
[01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:55.036]  We are going to be breaking it all down, taking your phone calls, and a lot more.
[01:15:55.056 --> 01:15:55.397]  Stay with us.
[01:16:08.268 --> 01:16:09.408]  Dr. Shiva's our guest.
[01:16:09.809 --> 01:16:11.049]  Great guy running for Senate.
[01:16:11.369 --> 01:16:12.250]  Got a shot at winning.
[01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:14.790]  And Elizabeth Warren, really a smart engineer.
[01:16:15.051 --> 01:16:16.091]  Very successful businessman.
[01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:17.171]  Inventor of email.
[01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:17.572]  Look it up.
[01:16:17.652 --> 01:16:18.092]  It's true.
[01:16:18.292 --> 01:16:27.555]  And he is running against Elizabeth Warren, who will not do the genetic test, who the tribes say she has no connection to in Oklahoma or other areas.
[01:16:27.615 --> 01:16:30.596]  But he's a real Indian from the subcontinent, India.
[01:16:30.636 --> 01:16:31.517]  But he's a great patriot.
[01:16:31.537 --> 01:16:32.377]  I'd love to get him in the U.S.
[01:16:32.417 --> 01:16:32.697]  Senate.
[01:16:32.737 --> 01:16:37.499]  Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, thanks for joining us with some big, breaking, exclusive news.
[01:16:37.739 --> 01:16:42.181]  You know, we got this big sign out here, you may see it, you know, only the real Indian can defeat the fake Indian.
[01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:58.728]  It's a very powerful meme, Alex, and I want to really explain why it's so powerful and why we put it out there, because it really is an expression of not only my anger, but pretty much everyone's anger at the corruption that is taking place in government, and Elizabeth Warren is the face of that corruption.
[01:16:58.748 --> 01:17:06.631]  So when we put that signage up on our bus, the city of Cambridge, which is supposed to be the most liberal haven on the planet, said we had to take it down.
[01:17:07.572 --> 01:17:09.613]  That was on April 5th, 2018.
[01:17:09.673 --> 01:17:10.334]  We didn't do that.
[01:17:10.374 --> 01:17:14.978]  In fact, we retaliated hard and we sued them, took them to federal court, and we won.
[01:17:15.338 --> 01:17:18.501]  They surrendered completely.
[01:17:19.061 --> 01:17:22.484]  And, you know, then based on that, we dismissed the court case.
[01:17:22.524 --> 01:17:25.507]  Obviously, the mainstream media did not want to cover our victory.
[01:17:26.027 --> 01:17:28.630]  So what we realize, Alex, the big news is this.
[01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.052]  And this is something that's really, really important.
[01:17:31.092 --> 01:17:33.574]  You see, for far too long, the establishment
[01:17:34.334 --> 01:17:40.079]  Has made politics a Essentially a you know an audience sport, right?
[01:17:40.379 --> 01:17:55.572]  They do not want the everyday citizen to actually be involved in that aspect They want to make it the old Hollywood celebrity culture You put a couple of people on pedestals and we're supposed to watch them and eat our popcorn So what we've done here Alex is that's becoming really powerful as we figured out the victory to win it
[01:17:55.792 --> 01:18:04.737]  And what we realized was people say, you know what, you guys have a lot of courage to put that out there because you're bringing out something in Massachusetts that people do not want to talk about.
[01:18:04.817 --> 01:18:07.059]  It's a weaponized way of getting across our message.
[01:18:07.079 --> 01:18:11.201]  So what we've done is, if you see these magnetic signs here, they're really easy.
[01:18:11.581 --> 01:18:15.283]  So we want to replicate this all over the state, Alex.
[01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:16.364]  In fact, all over the country.
[01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:36.244]  And basically people can buy these magnetic signs you can see as you're showing being put on and where since we launched we have you know tons of people starting to write and wanting these and why is that and the reality is when Elizabeth Warren it's not about identity right the liberals want to convert it to a race issue but it's nothing to do with race it has to do
[01:18:36.724 --> 01:18:37.485]  With integrity.
[01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:41.027]  We're talking about someone who did not work hard, who cut in line.
[01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:45.370]  You, me, Alex, and pretty much every American watching your show works for a living.
[01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:47.212]  You know, I mowed lawns as a kid.
[01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:51.415]  You know, learned to engineer software as a kid, as a 14-year-old kid.
[01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.956]  I've been working all my life.
[01:18:53.256 --> 01:18:56.599]  But Elizabeth Warren cut in front of line, and they do not want to discuss that.
[01:18:56.659 --> 01:19:02.223]  So we are bringing up not just a race issue, because for far too long down the street is Harvard University.
[01:19:02.743 --> 01:19:11.645]  The white liberal racists who want us to keep us all on their reservation and plantation have bounded the discussion of race, Alex, and they don't know what to do with us.
[01:19:11.925 --> 01:19:14.925]  Because when we bring up that sign, they'll say, oh, that's racist.
[01:19:14.985 --> 01:19:15.726]  We'll say, really?
[01:19:16.086 --> 01:19:23.067]  And we'll flip it back and we say, look, you're the racist because you're supporting a woman who took advantage of race to get in and when she's not of that race.
[01:19:23.407 --> 01:19:27.628]  How do folks, even though they're not in Massachusetts, how do they get one of these babies?
[01:19:27.808 --> 01:19:28.388]  It's very easy.
[01:19:28.408 --> 01:19:30.130]  You just go to shiva4senate.com.
[01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:31.350]  You can find it right there.
[01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:32.751]  It's called a Road Warrior Kit.
[01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:33.572]  Go to the store.
[01:19:33.912 --> 01:19:35.093]  Get the Road Warrior Kit.
[01:19:35.133 --> 01:19:35.633]  We've made it.
[01:19:35.873 --> 01:19:37.154]  You get two magnetic stickers.
[01:19:37.174 --> 01:19:37.995]  You get a lawn sign.
[01:19:38.015 --> 01:19:39.036]  You get two bumper stickers.
[01:19:39.596 --> 01:19:39.956]  Oh my god.
[01:19:39.976 --> 01:19:41.978]  You gotta call this Operation Road Warrior.
[01:19:41.998 --> 01:19:42.758]  Is that what you're calling it?
[01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.318]  That's what I call it.
[01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:44.459]  It's called Road Warrior.
[01:19:44.719 --> 01:19:45.780]  Be a Road Warrior.
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.241]  That's getting back.
[01:19:47.721 --> 01:19:51.364]  So if you can't come to and pass out cards, you can't do anything.
[01:19:51.384 --> 01:19:52.184]  You know, you got family.
[01:19:52.404 --> 01:19:53.885]  Hey, I'm fully supporting this.
[01:19:54.386 --> 01:19:55.346]  But I am stealing the idea.
[01:19:55.366 --> 01:19:57.268]  We're gonna launch Operation Road Warrior with our stuff too.
[01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:10.276]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:13.658 --> 01:20:16.439]  He's going the distance!
[01:20:16.459 --> 01:20:17.400]  He's going for speed!
[01:20:33.556 --> 01:20:38.477]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.839]  All right, The Amazing Lucas is in studio with us.
[01:20:45.859 --> 01:20:50.580]  I intend to open the phones up coming up later in the next hour, and I should have told you this.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.220]  I should have told you this.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.341]  Mike Cernovich is coming on, and Mike Cernovich, if you notice,
[01:20:57.891 --> 01:20:59.592]  They've really been demonizing and attacking.
[01:20:59.612 --> 01:21:01.554]  The left is really afraid of Mike.
[01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:04.176]  And that's because the left likes him.
[01:21:04.576 --> 01:21:05.477]  He's a likable guy.
[01:21:05.497 --> 01:21:06.858]  I wouldn't even call him a conservative.
[01:21:06.878 --> 01:21:07.699]  He's more of a libertarian.
[01:21:08.059 --> 01:21:16.125]  And now Bill Maher bizarrely had a meltdown saying, I'm a liar about him saying he wants the economy to crash, even though he said it.
[01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.609]  And I'm a liar that he's made $100 million on his contract when that's on record.
[01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:23.787]  I mean, that's on record from HBO.
[01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:32.273]  And he goes further, and he says, so this is coming up next segment, that he hopes that Mike Cernovich dies.
[01:21:33.214 --> 01:21:39.398]  And then he says, oh, I really just want to cook your head in an oven for children to eat, and it's not even funny.
[01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:41.660]  And then he goes, no, actually, I want you to get help.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.222]  So Mar is having, what do you think that is?
[01:21:44.262 --> 01:21:45.263]  We're going to play the clip coming up.
[01:21:46.386 --> 01:21:46.847]  I don't know.
[01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:49.711]  I guess it's Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:21:50.092 --> 01:21:55.680]  Because I heard him say when he was talking about, you know what, it's time for the economy to crash if it means getting the president out.
[01:21:56.738 --> 01:21:58.939]  I was like, that's, that's insanity.
[01:21:59.019 --> 01:22:03.460]  That's, to have millions of people to be out of work, that impacts everyone.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.081]  And that shows the vitriol that they have for this president.
[01:22:06.281 --> 01:22:09.382]  Has nothing to do with his policies, has nothing to do with his administration.
[01:22:09.762 --> 01:22:10.562]  It is personal.
[01:22:10.582 --> 01:22:13.783]  I don't think, I don't think we've ever seen anything like this before.
[01:22:13.843 --> 01:22:14.483]  It's unprecedented.
[01:22:14.723 --> 01:22:15.984]  And that's what Mike Cernovich said.
[01:22:16.004 --> 01:22:23.086]  He said, uh, he had a link to Reuters pointing out that you basically have a doubling of suicides during just a recession.
[01:22:25.345 --> 01:22:26.286]  He made a joke about that.
[01:22:26.306 --> 01:22:27.367]  I mean, this is sickness.
[01:22:29.628 --> 01:22:31.530]  Yeah, I mean, it actually is.
[01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:35.913]  But the thing is, what they do, because I saw how you responded, but you responded, you know, tongue in cheek.
[01:22:36.374 --> 01:22:37.815]  You know, that's that's the way they do it.
[01:22:37.835 --> 01:22:41.978]  They encapsulate it in like this little comical humorous, you know, ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:22:42.619 --> 01:22:46.162]  Well, in the meantime, they mean exactly they mean everything that they say.
[01:22:46.982 --> 01:22:48.523]  Well, that's the thing is that.
[01:22:49.444 --> 01:22:52.866]  They take this little girl who was never separated from her mother, put her on the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:22:53.326 --> 01:22:54.787]  She's at a family center, totally safe.
[01:22:55.247 --> 01:22:57.889]  The mother has smuggled people here before.
[01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:00.671]  She's been deported in 2013.
[01:23:01.611 --> 01:23:03.452]  And then they get caught lying.
[01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:07.815]  Tom Arnold lies and says that, oh, Cohen's going public against the president.
[01:23:07.835 --> 01:23:08.475]  None of that was true.
[01:23:08.515 --> 01:23:12.177]  I mean, now they're just reduced to hoaxing.
[01:23:13.538 --> 01:23:14.959]  They have no credibility left.
[01:23:15.987 --> 01:23:21.949]  And then they say, we're these heartless, horrible people, but they want to abort as many kids as they can, The Amazing Lucas.
[01:23:22.509 --> 01:23:26.930]  And, on top of it, they don't care if we have 10,000 extra suicides during a recession.
[01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:27.630]  Absolutely.
[01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:30.951]  And not only that, that lady, she left three other kids there.
[01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:34.912]  Sounds like you left three other kids there, along with your husband.
[01:23:36.112 --> 01:23:36.552]  To what?
[01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:38.313]  To come here illegally?
[01:23:39.335 --> 01:23:41.698]  And then be surprised when we enforce our laws?
[01:23:41.938 --> 01:23:43.059]  That's what blows my mind.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.501]  I've never heard of such a thing.
[01:23:44.781 --> 01:23:47.404]  I'm like, if you do, if you commit a crime here, guess what?
[01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:48.426]  You suffer the punishment.
[01:23:48.726 --> 01:23:57.857]  But I guess, I guess not, you know, in New York we have de Blasio, who's lessened the penalty for drunk driving and grand larceny for illegals.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.222]  Who else have they done that for?
[01:24:02.242 --> 01:24:06.765]  Well that's the thing is they're setting it up to incentivize people coming to Europe, coming here.
[01:24:06.785 --> 01:24:11.609]  They give them everything free and then say you actually are above the law to incentivize.
[01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:12.289]  Exactly!
[01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.631]  And it's like you're sending two different messages.
[01:24:15.052 --> 01:24:18.294]  Trump is trying to enforce our laws that we already have to the fullest extent.
[01:24:18.314 --> 01:24:19.135]  And treat us equal!
[01:24:19.415 --> 01:24:19.875]  Exactly!
[01:24:20.396 --> 01:24:25.680]  But at the same time, how are you going to say don't come here but if you come here it's okay because we have sanctuary states?
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.521]  That blows my mind.
[01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:29.903]  That's like telling someone, hey, I'm an officer.
[01:24:30.623 --> 01:24:32.145]  If you run that red light, that's legal.
[01:24:32.285 --> 01:24:34.346]  But if you do it, I'm not going to give you a ticket.
[01:24:35.848 --> 01:24:36.068]  What?
[01:24:36.608 --> 01:24:44.935]  Well, let me tell you, if my wife tried to smuggle our four-year-old daughter over 100 miles of deadly desert, probably the most dangerous area of the world, I mean, she would deserve to be arrested.
[01:24:45.215 --> 01:24:45.755]  I would deserve.
[01:24:46.056 --> 01:24:51.400]  How is this mother not having any responsibility for what she did, and then Trump is this bully hurting her?
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.323]  It's just, it's crazy, because the logic is so simple that it's a fraud.
[01:24:56.384 --> 01:24:56.885]  Completely.
[01:24:56.925 --> 01:25:00.288]  You would think that they would be looking at her like, that's child endangerment.
[01:25:00.588 --> 01:25:02.310]  That's what you just did.
[01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:04.291]  You're unfit to be a parent right now.
[01:25:04.812 --> 01:25:06.493]  But they completely reverse it.
[01:25:06.513 --> 01:25:08.435]  Instead of looking at the criminal, they look at the law.
[01:25:08.455 --> 01:25:10.277]  Well, the law needs to be abolished.
[01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:12.979]  The same thing they did with the Electoral College.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.642]  When the Electoral College said, we're giving it to Trump.
[01:25:16.022 --> 01:25:17.343]  Well, it's not that they voted.
[01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:18.604]  It's, you know what?
[01:25:18.784 --> 01:25:20.366]  We need to remove the Electoral College.
[01:25:22.893 --> 01:25:29.217]  I think people are waking up because due to this incessant attack, attack, attack, just a myriad of attacks.
[01:25:29.618 --> 01:25:32.720]  Let me ask you this question because you're a smart guy at a gut level.
[01:25:33.801 --> 01:25:36.863]  So I've watched a lot of your videos and my son likes them as well.
[01:25:36.963 --> 01:25:38.244]  You get into a lot of nuances.
[01:25:40.444 --> 01:25:42.045]  At a gut level, how do you see this ending?
[01:25:42.085 --> 01:25:50.671]  Because I know they're crazy, they're out of control, people are waking up, but that makes them only more desperate, and they're just, they're like crazy zombies or something.
[01:25:51.712 --> 01:25:59.417]  Maxine Waters, Mueller, all these Hillary, looks like a jack-o-lantern demon, and lies constantly, and they just never go away.
[01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:06.001]  Pelosi can't even hardly talk, but they're in charge, and they're telling us we're gonna remove the president extrajudicially.
[01:26:06.301 --> 01:26:08.283]  I mean, they're on TV saying we're gonna kill him!
[01:26:08.803 --> 01:26:09.844]  Phil Mudd used to run,
[01:26:10.564 --> 01:26:12.125]  Assassination squads overseas.
[01:26:12.165 --> 01:26:16.888]  He never did the killing himself, but that's what he did was run assassinations, counterterrorism.
[01:26:17.368 --> 01:26:25.733]  So a guy whose job it is to assassinate people, who runs operations to do that, is saying we're going to kill the president.
[01:26:26.033 --> 01:26:30.156]  At a certain point, I think Trump's got a problem if he doesn't go in there and do something to Mudd.
[01:26:30.196 --> 01:26:33.077]  And I know they're coming after me because I've been saying something needs to be done, but I'm sorry, man.
[01:26:33.498 --> 01:26:36.099]  People start saying we're coming to kill you in Texas.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.701]  Folks that I grew up around said, well, we're coming for you.
[01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:40.902]  Wow.
[01:26:40.922 --> 01:26:41.563]  Does that make sense?
[01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:47.568]  It absolutely makes sense, because they're coming for everyone, even remotely, who don't even have an opinion on the issue.
[01:26:47.668 --> 01:26:50.490]  It's like, well, if you don't have an opinion, that's tacit approval of Trump.
[01:26:50.691 --> 01:26:51.511]  We can't allow that.
[01:26:52.232 --> 01:26:57.336]  And there comes a point in time where it's no longer, well, OK, I'm just going to, you know.
[01:26:57.576 --> 01:26:59.318]  Comes a point in time where someone's attacking you.
[01:26:59.538 --> 01:27:00.639]  You need to defend yourself.
[01:27:00.959 --> 01:27:01.320]  I agree.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:08.266]  What should happen to Peto, I mean, Peter Fonda, who should kidnap Trump's son and throw him in the thing with pedophiles?
[01:27:09.543 --> 01:27:12.686]  Same thing that happened to anyone else who would say something like that.
[01:27:13.707 --> 01:27:20.835]  Imagine if any conservative said something even remotely like that about Obama's daughter.
[01:27:21.596 --> 01:27:23.779]  They would get arrested for sure.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.204]  They may even get killed because of the mom mentality they had.
[01:27:30.572 --> 01:27:32.033]  Well, who brings people's kids into it?
[01:27:32.374 --> 01:27:33.395]  And I get his point.
[01:27:33.595 --> 01:27:34.596]  Boy, he looks like a pervert.
[01:27:34.936 --> 01:27:42.323]  I'm not saying Peter Fonda is a child molester, but man, if I was going to cast a child molester for a movie that kidnaps and kills kids, it'd be Peter Fonda.
[01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:44.465]  I mean, put that picture back up.
[01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:46.367]  Man, is he one ugly looking dude.
[01:27:46.487 --> 01:27:48.329]  He's shoe-in, just like, ah, you got the role.
[01:27:48.789 --> 01:27:49.430]  Look at that!
[01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:53.471]  You imagine being a little kid and that guy walks in the room?
[01:27:54.712 --> 01:27:55.953]  Thing of nightmares are made of.
[01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:58.094]  Man, that guy is a sick freak.
[01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:04.418]  Reportedly, people that know him in Hollywood say he is a... Like, we're talking even stupider than Maxine Waters.
[01:28:04.438 --> 01:28:05.719]  They say he is so dumb.
[01:28:05.759 --> 01:28:05.819]  Wow.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:06.860]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.461]  I didn't think that was possible.
[01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:14.401]  Maxine, you know, she's now saying that no one's criticizing her.
[01:28:14.421 --> 01:28:19.725]  She says, my own party's not criticizing me, even though we have on video Schumer.
[01:28:19.765 --> 01:28:22.727]  Yeah, Schumer just came out to, not only that, but also Pelosi.
[01:28:22.987 --> 01:28:26.930]  But what she said is, when they confronted her, is, the president is lying.
[01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:27.830]  I never said that.
[01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:30.032]  I'm like, we have it on tape.
[01:28:30.392 --> 01:28:31.393]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:28:31.433 --> 01:28:36.437]  What are you, how are you gonna just boldface lie to my face, gonna spit in my face, and then tell me it's raining?
[01:28:37.932 --> 01:28:42.193]  Well, I just think it's sick that Peter Fonda is dreaming about little kids getting raped by pedophiles.
[01:28:42.453 --> 01:28:43.814]  I mean, I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[01:28:44.674 --> 01:28:50.876]  I'm just saying that, you know, that he and Hayden could start a movie about two pedophiles going on a cross-country trip together.
[01:28:52.016 --> 01:28:52.396]  I'm serious.
[01:28:52.416 --> 01:28:53.136]  These people are sick.
[01:28:53.196 --> 01:28:55.577]  We'll be right back with Amazing Lucas and Mike Cernovich.

[01:30:09.432 --> 01:30:09.993]  Good, how are you?
[01:30:10.213 --> 01:30:14.396]  Alright, I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my own free coffee.
[01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:15.437]  I saw that.
[01:30:15.517 --> 01:30:21.242]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[01:30:21.422 --> 01:30:22.823]  What's that?
[01:30:22.923 --> 01:30:24.004]  Is that a real thing?
[01:30:24.404 --> 01:30:25.165]  It's a real thing.
[01:30:25.225 --> 01:30:26.506]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[01:30:26.646 --> 01:30:29.428]  I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[01:30:29.468 --> 01:30:30.970]  Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:32.731]  Yeah.
[01:30:33.572 --> 01:30:34.534]  Reparations, man.
[01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:38.000]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[01:30:38.341 --> 01:30:39.222]  Black lives matter.
[01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:44.692]  I'll take caramel.
[01:30:47.193 --> 01:30:47.693]  What's your name?
[01:30:47.713 --> 01:30:48.533]  I appreciate you.
[01:30:48.793 --> 01:30:49.254]  Amanda?
[01:30:49.494 --> 01:30:50.674]  Amanda, you are great.
[01:30:50.694 --> 01:30:51.194]  Is it?
[01:30:51.314 --> 01:30:52.714]  You're amazing.
[01:30:52.734 --> 01:30:53.795]  Thank you.
[01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:55.615]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:30:55.635 --> 01:30:57.455]  You gotta get your free coffee out here, man.
[01:30:57.475 --> 01:31:00.236]  You gotta get your Starbucks reparations, man.
[01:31:00.936 --> 01:31:02.097]  Hotep Jesus was the man.
[01:31:02.317 --> 01:31:05.417]  So he got the brilliant idea to go into a Starbucks and demand a coffee.
[01:31:05.437 --> 01:31:06.358]  Otherwise, they're racist.
[01:31:06.658 --> 01:31:08.738]  He's gonna go get a free chocolate chip cookie after the show.
[01:31:08.958 --> 01:31:11.119]  So there's... Oh, he got his Starbucks mug right there.
[01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:12.339]  Was that a free Joe?
[01:31:15.549 --> 01:31:17.652]  This was the free joke.
[01:31:19.154 --> 01:31:26.123]  So we need to get that cup and put that cup in a glass case and save it for all eternity.
[01:31:26.163 --> 01:31:26.964]  There it is right there.
[01:31:27.264 --> 01:31:28.566]  Oh, they even put your name on there!
[01:31:29.447 --> 01:31:30.408]  That's a great picture!
[01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:37.391]  You know, I understand liberal politics.
[01:31:38.151 --> 01:31:41.912]  I've been studying it for a while now and understand that.
[01:31:42.232 --> 01:31:43.292]  And I've tweeted this before.
[01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:56.436]  I said, if an individual, especially a black individual, wants to excel in this society, they should follow the liberal narrative and all doors and opportunities will be open to them.
[01:31:57.558 --> 01:31:58.799]  And I knew it would work.
[01:31:58.819 --> 01:32:00.279]  I knew it would work.
[01:32:00.319 --> 01:32:01.860]  So I decided, you know, I said, you know what?
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.341]  I'm standing here by this Starbucks.
[01:32:03.381 --> 01:32:04.701]  I had this idea in my mind.
[01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:07.122]  I said, let's test this thing out and see what happens.
[01:32:07.483 --> 01:32:09.604]  The video started to go viral on Periscope.
[01:32:10.004 --> 01:32:10.744]  And now here we are.
[01:32:11.504 --> 01:32:17.667]  I wasn't mad at Starbucks at first, but now I'm mad at Starbucks for this racial bias training.
[01:32:18.427 --> 01:32:19.388]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[01:32:20.214 --> 01:32:23.477]  First of all, what does Eric Holder know about Black people?
[01:32:23.877 --> 01:32:28.220]  What does the NAACP or the ADL know about Black people?
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.542]  The Black people really suck one in the hood.
[01:32:30.762 --> 01:32:37.127]  You see, Black Lives Matter, NAACP, and Eric Holder are not the voice of Black people.
[01:32:37.387 --> 01:32:41.970]  That is the bourgeoisie that keep Black people down.
[01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:44.032]  And Starbucks failed.
[01:32:44.372 --> 01:32:44.972]  They failed.
[01:32:45.273 --> 01:32:56.158]  If they really wanted to do some racial so-called bias training, they would have got some real people in the real world and not these bootlickers and Uncle Tom's.
[01:32:56.418 --> 01:32:57.458]  That's what they would have done.
[01:32:57.698 --> 01:32:59.379]  But they don't care about black people.
[01:33:05.022 --> 01:33:07.683]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.055 --> 01:33:18.157]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.702 --> 01:33:38.123]  Stop impersonating Democrats.
[01:33:38.143 --> 01:33:39.523]  Sorry, that's not...
[01:33:44.602 --> 01:33:45.805]  Is that someone that you like?
[01:33:45.825 --> 01:33:46.086]  Science!
[01:33:46.126 --> 01:33:46.728]  Science!
[01:33:46.748 --> 01:33:46.948]  Science!
[01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:48.473]  Climate change!
[01:33:48.854 --> 01:33:49.215]  500 genders!
[01:34:01.158 --> 01:34:20.763]  Well, we've got Mike Cernovich via the Skype, and we've got the amazing Lucas in studio with us, but I wanted to just play a short clip of Bill Maher, and then I'll play the longer clip, because it appears he's having some type of weird mental breakdown, because everything he says in these little periods, with the little scripted images beside him, are off a teleprompter.
[01:34:21.123 --> 01:34:23.423]  I know folks that have been there at the production.
[01:34:23.863 --> 01:34:25.704]  So when he does his monologue, it's a teleprompter.
[01:34:26.564 --> 01:34:29.725]  And so, the stuff they wrote doesn't make any sense
[01:34:31.028 --> 01:34:33.249]  Stick Mike Cernovich's head in an oven.
[01:34:33.309 --> 01:34:35.250]  Have children eat his dead head.
[01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:37.491]  He hopes Mike Cernovich commits suicide.
[01:34:37.951 --> 01:34:47.055]  And I think it's because he's so destroyed by Mike Cernovich pointing out that suicides, you have 10,000 extra suicides for every recession, that they basically double.
[01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:48.835]  And that he was calling for an economic crash.
[01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:52.937]  And that I pointed this out, that he makes $10 million a year on his contract.
[01:34:53.257 --> 01:34:54.198]  He's had 10 seasons.
[01:34:54.238 --> 01:34:55.458]  They say he's been paid $100 million.
[01:34:56.419 --> 01:34:58.199]  Variety reports that he says, I'm a liar.
[01:34:58.639 --> 01:34:59.460]  So why
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:05.144]  Are they every week now singling myself and Mike Cernovich out on these TV programs?
[01:35:05.224 --> 01:35:08.887]  What is it that triggers them about Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones?
[01:35:08.907 --> 01:35:12.610]  But I got to say, I'm getting a little jealous when they're saying they want to kill you.
[01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:17.634]  Now, that happens sometimes, but I haven't had that yet from old Bill Maher.
[01:35:18.014 --> 01:35:20.256]  He looks like he is about to kill himself when he talks about me.
[01:35:20.556 --> 01:35:22.357]  So this is very interesting psychology.
[01:35:22.377 --> 01:35:26.580]  And Mike Cernovich gets into the psychology from a kind of archetypal union way.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.881]  I think that's what scares him.
[01:35:27.901 --> 01:35:28.502]  So let's play the clip.
[01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:29.343]  Get Mike Cernovich's take.
[01:35:29.363 --> 01:35:29.643]  Here it is.
[01:35:30.464 --> 01:35:33.685]  Mike Cernovich said, suicides increase during recessions.
[01:35:33.785 --> 01:35:35.665]  Bill Maher wants people to die.
[01:35:37.946 --> 01:35:40.166]  Yes, specifically Mike Cernovich.
[01:35:40.186 --> 01:35:46.108]  I guess it's about laughing about people dying.
[01:35:46.128 --> 01:35:50.008]  I want him to put his head in the oven so starving kids confuse it for food.
[01:35:51.089 --> 01:35:51.389]  Wow.
[01:35:52.469 --> 01:35:53.589]  No, I don't want that.
[01:35:54.449 --> 01:35:56.670]  I don't know who the f*** are Mike Cernovich, but...
[01:35:59.304 --> 01:36:03.846]  I want you to live a long, healthy life and get the help you so desperately need.
[01:36:03.866 --> 01:36:11.229]  So, you talk about convoluted craziness, and before that he says, I'm lying about him being rich and a depression not hurting him.
[01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:13.010]  Which is total truth.
[01:36:13.650 --> 01:36:16.691]  So, Amazing Lucas, before we go to Mike Cernovich, what do you make of that?
[01:36:16.732 --> 01:36:17.592]  It doesn't even make sense.
[01:36:18.292 --> 01:36:22.014]  That's the first time me hearing him saying, put the head in the... I was just...
[01:36:22.918 --> 01:36:26.445]  But once again, it's the crowd going, laughing it up.
[01:36:26.946 --> 01:36:27.788]  That's the goal.
[01:36:27.868 --> 01:36:29.612]  Get them to laugh about killing us.
[01:36:30.173 --> 01:36:31.215]  It's just an incitement to kill us.
[01:36:32.382 --> 01:36:34.424]  It's just, it's like... That's what Starnum said a year ago.
[01:36:34.604 --> 01:36:35.565]  I said, why are they doing this?
[01:36:35.585 --> 01:36:37.487]  He goes, they just want to start killing us.
[01:36:38.388 --> 01:36:40.150]  They're gearing up for killing us.
[01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:47.016]  It's this process of dehumanization, saying, you know, what they're saying is absolutely, it's all a conspiracy theories and everything.
[01:36:47.296 --> 01:36:50.599]  So that way people don't go in and search what you're actually saying is true.
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.061]  Absolutely.
[01:36:52.101 --> 01:36:54.723]  Well, Mike, what do you make of this latest meltdown?
[01:36:54.763 --> 01:36:55.925]  I mean, it just adds the whole
[01:36:57.142 --> 01:37:06.898]  Harass conservatives, harass Trump people, kill Trump, dump hot coffee on Alex Jones, sue Alex Jones, bankrupt libertarian media, dox the ICE agents.
[01:37:06.978 --> 01:37:11.626]  I mean, they're gearing up, it appears, at the end of summer here to really try to launch a violent overthrow.
[01:37:13.132 --> 01:37:14.693]  Yeah, I mean there's a number of things.
[01:37:15.014 --> 01:37:21.759]  One is that Bill Maher was triggered by the truth because we now troll with the truth.
[01:37:22.059 --> 01:37:29.205]  The number one thing that I've learned over the years is that the left, the way to really trigger the left is with facts and logic and reason.
[01:37:29.945 --> 01:37:37.031]  And they didn't have any, he didn't have any issue to what I said, because if you do want a recession, you are saying you want people to kill themselves.
[01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:44.818]  And then of course, you know, when Anthony Bourdain killed himself, all of the worst people in the world are like, oh, we're so sad.
[01:37:45.178 --> 01:37:46.419]  Call the hotline.
[01:37:46.779 --> 01:37:47.300]  Love.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.301]  Oh my God, your life matters.
[01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:58.489]  And then like the next day, they're like, yeah, kill conservatives, hunt them down, rape their children, throw them in cages, have pedophiles rape children in front of their moms.
[01:37:58.929 --> 01:37:59.970]  Yeah, that's what we're going to do.
[01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:04.592]  So, we're exposing their hypocrisy and they don't have an answer for it.
[01:38:05.272 --> 01:38:07.193]  And they seem to be going crazier by the minute.
[01:38:07.233 --> 01:38:08.794]  I asked you this question about two years ago.
[01:38:08.854 --> 01:38:13.697]  I said, during the campaign, what is peak insane libtard behavior?
[01:38:14.177 --> 01:38:21.020]  But now they're not so much libtards, they're like crazy Tasmanian devils that lie and attack logic.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.382]  I mean, they are really, it seems, degenerating.
[01:38:25.871 --> 01:38:28.532]  Well, they know that they're not going to win in November.
[01:38:28.712 --> 01:38:31.133]  That's what is amusing me.
[01:38:31.813 --> 01:38:33.234]  They're not playing like winners.
[01:38:34.154 --> 01:38:43.378]  So people have noticed that I used to be a very, I don't know, I used to be a little bit of a wild man and I've calmed down and they go, oh, is having a daughter calmed you down?
[01:38:43.418 --> 01:38:49.600]  And the answer is no, we were winning, you know, we are the voice of reason now.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:54.462]  And the left, they keep claiming they're going to win in November, but they have no solutions.
[01:38:54.502 --> 01:38:55.323]  They have no answers.
[01:38:55.363 --> 01:38:57.144]  So here's what the left stands for.
[01:38:57.184 --> 01:38:58.345]  This is now truth, by the way.
[01:38:58.385 --> 01:38:59.245]  This is all confirmed.
[01:38:59.885 --> 01:39:05.188]  The left now stands for branding women, as the NXIVM sex cult did.
[01:39:05.369 --> 01:39:11.112]  And if you look into the donors and the connections to some of the Clinton Foundation donors, you're going to find connections there.
[01:39:11.692 --> 01:39:14.694]  Eric Schneiderman or whatever, the former Attorney General of New York,
[01:39:15.434 --> 01:39:18.237]  And you're not just saying that because I remember growing up
[01:39:38.345 --> 01:39:38.485]  Yeah.
[01:39:54.508 --> 01:40:02.597]  I could tell all the stories it would take all day, but that's when I began to discover that Democrats at the top and at the middle level are just sick criminals.
[01:40:02.797 --> 01:40:04.219]  I mean, I'm sorry, it's just true.
[01:40:04.559 --> 01:40:05.420]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.122]  And they're the main ones who are racist.
[01:40:07.442 --> 01:40:11.687]  But what they've done is they've managed to now go so far as to change our history books.
[01:40:12.227 --> 01:40:15.411]  So now children are growing up learning what they want them to believe.
[01:40:16.493 --> 01:40:18.815]  And I'm like, that's, that's, that's demonic.
[01:40:18.935 --> 01:40:19.776]  It's Machiavellian.
[01:40:20.577 --> 01:40:23.920]  And you know what, they have this whole idea of the party switch, the party switch.
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:27.844]  I'm like, that's the most historical, just absolute drivel.
[01:40:27.924 --> 01:40:28.384]  It's a prattle.
[01:40:28.945 --> 01:40:31.627]  But they keep repeating it, and it's this gaslighting of repetition.
[01:40:31.687 --> 01:40:34.310]  Once you repeat something, everyone around you is repeating it.
[01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:36.192]  Well now, it slowly becomes truth.
[01:40:36.472 --> 01:40:39.435]  And the people who are actually telling the truth, well now they're seen as the crazies.
[01:40:41.411 --> 01:40:41.792]  I agree.
[01:40:41.832 --> 01:40:43.133]  Mike?
[01:40:43.193 --> 01:40:55.406]  Speaking of racist Democrats, there's a video, terrible video, shows a white woman purportedly harassing a Mexican-American citizen and everything.
[01:40:55.446 --> 01:40:59.831]  And I'm just wondering why that woman, nobody seems to know who she is.
[01:40:59.871 --> 01:41:01.773]  They keep calling her an unidentified woman.
[01:41:02.393 --> 01:41:09.637]  Which I find interesting because the media is always able to find, you know, anonymous gift makers, anonymous people.
[01:41:10.017 --> 01:41:11.237]  They have no problem with that.
[01:41:11.277 --> 01:41:15.259]  What you're saying is the left is famous for staging false flags.
[01:41:15.299 --> 01:41:21.822]  The police say something like 98% of poop swastikas and stuff at the Air Force Academy.
[01:41:22.063 --> 01:41:24.304]  It's the left doing it for themselves, is what you're saying.
[01:41:25.104 --> 01:41:26.885]  Well, I'm saying, I'm just wondering,
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.382]  Why we don't know the woman's name yet.
[01:41:29.482 --> 01:41:35.047]  I grew up in a small town, the Running Springs, California, the town where the video was filmed.
[01:41:35.067 --> 01:41:35.427]  5,000 people.
[01:41:35.907 --> 01:41:42.753]  In a town of 5,000 people, if someone in that town makes national news, international news, talk of the town, right?
[01:41:42.773 --> 01:41:44.595]  They're going to be in the paper that day.
[01:41:45.444 --> 01:41:50.307]  Yeah, so I've been on every public Facebook group for Running Springs, California.
[01:41:51.008 --> 01:41:53.690]  Nobody's saying, oh my god, I can't believe this woman embarrassed us.
[01:41:53.730 --> 01:41:56.411]  Nobody's identified her in this very, very small town.
[01:41:56.652 --> 01:41:58.473]  Yeah, we haven't played that video yet.
[01:41:58.553 --> 01:41:58.973]  I saw that.
[01:41:58.993 --> 01:41:59.814]  We should cue that up.
[01:42:00.354 --> 01:42:07.759]  And if you go to CNN's website, it's all like, watch this man tell Mexicans to get out of the restaurant.
[01:42:07.819 --> 01:42:09.800]  And you watch it, and it's bad acting.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:14.023]  Who actually walks in and goes, Mexicans, get out of here!
[01:42:14.083 --> 01:42:15.144]  I mean, it's so fake.
[01:42:16.184 --> 01:42:16.405]  It is.
[01:42:16.605 --> 01:42:20.707]  But the thing is, desperate times call for desperate measures.
[01:42:21.828 --> 01:42:25.610]  And as we get closer and closer, it's just going to get more desperate and desperate.
[01:42:27.391 --> 01:42:27.831]  I agree.
[01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:32.974]  I've got a thousand questions for both of you, but Mike Cermas, when we come back, what else is on your radar screen you want to hit?
[01:42:34.295 --> 01:42:39.438]  Well, I think that video is very important for maybe all of us to watch and discuss because it raises a lot of issues.
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:44.982]  All I know is, remember the attacks on the synagogues, the attacks on the Jewish cemeteries?
[01:42:45.402 --> 01:42:47.623]  And then Trump said, I think that might be staged.
[01:42:48.143 --> 01:42:49.503]  They go, oh my God, you're anti-Semitic!
[01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:52.965]  And it turned out it was a leftist Jewish guy did it.
[01:42:53.245 --> 01:42:54.785]  I mean, I'm just, I'm sorry.
[01:42:55.525 --> 01:42:57.106]  I've dealt with this myself, folks.
[01:42:57.886 --> 01:42:59.387]  That's all these people do is lie.
[01:43:00.236 --> 01:43:06.221]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[01:45:22.873 --> 01:45:38.220]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:48.665]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[01:45:49.285 --> 01:45:52.408]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[01:45:52.508 --> 01:45:52.788]  Why?
[01:45:53.068 --> 01:45:54.489]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter.
[01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:58.312]  And he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[01:45:58.873 --> 01:46:00.634]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:02.796]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[01:46:03.116 --> 01:46:07.780]  So we need you to go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:17.448]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine.

[01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:29.095]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[01:46:29.575 --> 01:46:35.799]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[01:46:36.059 --> 01:46:38.361]  When you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself.
[01:46:38.781 --> 01:46:40.462]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360-degree win.
[01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:49.588]  You win, and we win, because Alex Jones pumps the money back into InfoWars to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[01:46:49.868 --> 01:46:51.490]  So please, folks, do us a favor.
[01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:52.690]  Do yourself a favor.
[01:46:52.971 --> 01:46:54.412]  Stand up for the First Amendment.
[01:46:54.832 --> 01:46:57.454]  Kick George Soros right in the derriere.
[01:46:57.874 --> 01:46:59.515]  Go to the website now.
[01:47:04.479 --> 01:47:07.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:34.847 --> 01:47:38.350]  We now take you live to the retaking of America from the globalists.
[01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:39.671]  But they're striking back!
[01:47:40.732 --> 01:47:46.856]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:47:47.256 --> 01:47:50.179]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:53.221]  I don't want to give these people attention, but at this point we've got to cover it.
[01:47:53.281 --> 01:47:54.142]  I'm used to death threats.
[01:47:55.543 --> 01:47:57.305]  But these are very specific now.
[01:47:57.405 --> 01:48:00.309]  They're targeting libertarians, patriots, Christians, families.
[01:48:00.869 --> 01:48:06.516]  I was talking to Mike and he was showing me some stuff I'm not going to give attention to, but he was showing me stuff off record what they're doing to him and his family.
[01:48:06.676 --> 01:48:11.182]  And it's massive, it's coordinated, it's doxing, and
[01:48:12.952 --> 01:48:13.553]  It's incredible.
[01:48:14.413 --> 01:48:17.175]  And we've got the amazing Lucas riding shotgun here with us.
[01:48:17.195 --> 01:48:19.157]  Cernovich.com, Twitter at Cernovich.
[01:48:19.617 --> 01:48:23.380]  Mike Cernovich is here and he wanted to get into and I'm glad he raises this.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:23.901]  See it!
[01:48:24.641 --> 01:48:28.684]  Trump supporter threatens landscapers because they're Mexican, calls them rapists and animals.
[01:48:28.724 --> 01:48:39.253]  Now, you watch something like this and this is the most ridiculous thing on earth and
[01:48:41.088 --> 01:48:42.890]  The guy being yelled at looks real.
[01:48:44.431 --> 01:48:46.633]  Like, I don't think he knows that this is going on.
[01:48:46.913 --> 01:48:51.336]  But this is the type of false flag leftists have been caught doing over and over and over again.
[01:48:51.796 --> 01:48:54.719]  And strangely enough, white supremacists have been caught doing it too.
[01:48:54.739 --> 01:49:01.724]  There have been a lot of famous cases where a white woman will carve stuff on her and say that black guys raped her.
[01:49:01.784 --> 01:49:02.344]  I don't know why.
[01:49:02.445 --> 01:49:03.005]  I'm a news guy.
[01:49:03.025 --> 01:49:03.465]  I read the news.
[01:49:03.525 --> 01:49:04.946]  I've seen that probably 10 times.
[01:49:05.307 --> 01:49:06.588]  And there's also the other way around.
[01:49:07.368 --> 01:49:11.714]  Uh, where, uh, you know, black ladies will carve swastikas on themselves and say white guys did it.
[01:49:12.174 --> 01:49:13.636]  Hell, it happened in Austin a few years ago.
[01:49:13.856 --> 01:49:14.778]  Happened in College Station.
[01:49:14.818 --> 01:49:15.859]  I know two cases in Texas.
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:20.164]  So, there's this thing about being a victim and wanting the attention.
[01:49:20.184 --> 01:49:21.486]  And I'm not saying this is fake.
[01:49:21.526 --> 01:49:22.327]  We're gonna play the video, though.
[01:49:22.527 --> 01:49:23.708]  But I think Mike Cernovich is right.
[01:49:24.509 --> 01:49:33.756]  Just the fact that you go to CNN every day, there's some weird video, and I won't even say it, because they edit what I say when I do stuff out of context, and then say that I'm saying it, like Megyn Kelly did.
[01:49:33.796 --> 01:49:37.278]  I said, Hillary's responsible for killing tens of thousands of children in the Middle East.
[01:49:37.559 --> 01:49:39.720]  They edit it together about some pizza place so I could sue.
[01:49:40.261 --> 01:49:41.842]  And now she's going to get, well, I'm not going to say it.
[01:49:41.862 --> 01:49:42.522]  I don't have to say it.
[01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:43.483]  Wait until the surprise comes.
[01:49:43.663 --> 01:49:46.545]  The point is, is that, Mike Cernovich, this is next level.
[01:49:47.426 --> 01:49:48.286]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:49:48.426 --> 01:49:49.547]  I'm not saying it's fake.
[01:49:50.088 --> 01:49:53.070]  In fact, what I found interesting about this video,
[01:49:54.563 --> 01:50:00.845]  Is most Trump supporters, 99% will go, I've never seen a Trump supporter act like that.
[01:50:01.025 --> 01:50:02.346]  That's why we want to find out.
[01:50:02.426 --> 01:50:03.246]  Who is this woman?
[01:50:03.266 --> 01:50:05.227]  Did she escape from a mental institution?
[01:50:05.247 --> 01:50:06.447]  Does she need help?
[01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:09.188]  Maybe she needs psychiatric care?
[01:50:09.468 --> 01:50:12.369]  Oh, I get your angle because she does come off as a little bit wacky.
[01:50:12.689 --> 01:50:18.011]  You're saying it may not be completely staged, but people know who she is in the town, know she's a local loon and are protecting that.
[01:50:19.181 --> 01:50:22.264]  Yeah, so I'm worried about this woman's, that's an unstable thing.
[01:50:22.304 --> 01:50:27.448]  I mean, just going up to complete strangers and putting your hands in someone's face is a very violent act.
[01:50:27.468 --> 01:50:28.389]  That sounds like the Democrats.
[01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:30.450]  So it's very weird.
[01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:35.514]  So it could be she, you know, is just a town, you know, has really problems or whatever.
[01:50:36.195 --> 01:50:38.557]  But for me, what I find compelling is that
[01:50:39.298 --> 01:50:44.304]  If you make a gif or whatever, they can find you even if you're anonymous.
[01:50:44.364 --> 01:50:46.026]  But nobody's identified.
[01:50:46.147 --> 01:50:48.710]  Every video says unidentified white woman.
[01:50:49.431 --> 01:50:53.395]  Nobody on the private or the public Facebook... No one's looking!
[01:50:53.616 --> 01:50:56.119]  Because normally it'd be the search for who she is.
[01:50:56.479 --> 01:50:57.741]  Who is this idiot bigot?
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:00.401]  Like Permit Patty, for example.
[01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:04.183]  So there was that woman in San Francisco who, by the way, was a liberal.
[01:51:04.483 --> 01:51:11.748]  She was actually a liberal weed head, and she wanted to call the police on an eight-year-old African-American girl who was selling bottled water.
[01:51:12.208 --> 01:51:13.749]  They dubbed her Permit Patty.
[01:51:14.029 --> 01:51:16.191]  They found out who she was in 30 minutes, right?
[01:51:16.891 --> 01:51:20.133]  Permit Patty was a recent case of a San Francisco liberal.
[01:51:20.954 --> 01:51:21.415]  I agree.
[01:51:21.435 --> 01:51:22.236]  So what do you think?
[01:51:22.356 --> 01:51:26.060]  They know she's the local crank and they're covering that up and she's probably a Democrat?
[01:51:44.009 --> 01:51:49.932]  My best guess would be that she is a local, um, a senile person that they actually feel sorry for.
[01:51:49.952 --> 01:51:52.374]  And that they're just, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:53.154 --> 01:51:54.215]  And somebody sent her over.
[01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:58.377]  Well, I'm not trying to be mean, but once I went and watched the video, the guy looks like he's legitimately being bitched at.
[01:51:58.858 --> 01:52:02.140]  She just looks either like she's, it's a setup or she's nuts.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.040]  And I don't mean that meanly.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:07.123]  She does look like what you'd see on the street corner, you know, somebody that's schizophrenic.
[01:52:08.308 --> 01:52:15.569]  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying is, I think maybe like a local person goes, oh, ha ha ha, let's send this crazy.
[01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:19.010]  And again, I don't, my mother has been in institutions for bipolar.
[01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:20.430]  I take mental illness very seriously.
[01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:22.611]  So I'm not being... We're not making fun of her.
[01:52:22.631 --> 01:52:23.411]  Yeah, she just, yeah.
[01:52:23.731 --> 01:52:24.431]  Well, let me say this.
[01:52:24.591 --> 01:52:32.032]  I've never seen the racist stuff people talk about until I was getting divorced and my money was locked up and I couldn't get a house.
[01:52:32.272 --> 01:52:36.033]  So I got a three room condo and I was around the so-called leftist elitist.
[01:52:36.733 --> 01:52:39.835]  And I heard some race stuff from them, but they hated everybody.
[01:52:39.935 --> 01:52:40.295]  Everybody.
[01:52:40.335 --> 01:52:47.819]  When somebody else would walk over, we were grilling hamburgers out at the pool, they'd talk crap about them, they'd talk crap about the next person, they'd look at that dumb redneck, look at this person.
[01:52:48.239 --> 01:52:54.122]  But they had these cool guys that happened to be black that would detail your cars for a really good price in the garage.
[01:52:54.542 --> 01:52:58.144]  So I started finding out how much they were, I started getting them to clean my car once every two weeks.
[01:52:58.684 --> 01:53:05.528]  And I twice saw ladies in their Mercedes or whatever go over to the black guy that's like in somebody's car cleaning it, obviously going,
[01:53:05.848 --> 01:53:07.350]  What are you doing in here, black guy?
[01:53:07.551 --> 01:53:08.672]  So I get that goes on.
[01:53:08.692 --> 01:53:09.994]  It was very upsetting to me.
[01:53:11.517 --> 01:53:12.919]  And again, I found out who these women were.
[01:53:13.139 --> 01:53:13.780]  Guess what, Mike?
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.802]  They weren't conservatives.
[01:53:16.274 --> 01:53:17.875]  Well, that was what Permit Patty proved.
[01:53:18.636 --> 01:53:23.039]  Permit Patty was the face of modern mainstream liberalism.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:29.985]  Lives in San Francisco, selling marijuana, because if you're a white woman in San Francisco, you can sell marijuana and not go to jail.
[01:53:30.265 --> 01:53:34.629]  But if you're a young African-American girl trying to sell bottled water, they want to arrest you.
[01:53:34.649 --> 01:53:39.813]  So Permit Patty is that she is the face of modern white liberalism.
[01:53:39.893 --> 01:53:41.034]  And they love to call the police.
[01:53:41.054 --> 01:53:42.055]  Well, that was my thing.
[01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:42.976]  It wasn't even some
[01:53:44.172 --> 01:53:44.392]  I don't
[01:54:00.686 --> 01:54:03.447]  I don't care if I make a hundred grand a year doing this, poke these people, whatever.
[01:54:03.707 --> 01:54:05.407]  But the point was, those guys weren't victims.
[01:54:05.707 --> 01:54:09.188]  They were entrepreneurs doing a good job and getting pushed around.
[01:54:09.208 --> 01:54:13.129]  But they didn't take it on like, oh, I got a bunch of weird old white people messing with me.
[01:54:13.349 --> 01:54:13.909]  I'm gonna freak out.
[01:54:13.949 --> 01:54:15.970]  Listen, I gotta live in a gated community because of threats.
[01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:17.590]  I don't like living in even a fancy neighborhood.
[01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:21.691]  And all those old weirdos hate my ass, man, because I'm not in the country club.
[01:54:21.731 --> 01:54:22.431]  I don't play all that.
[01:54:22.672 --> 01:54:27.473]  Do I turn into this big victim because every one of these old blue blood mummies doesn't like me?
[01:54:27.533 --> 01:54:28.353]  No, I could care less.
[01:54:28.573 --> 01:54:33.236]  Yeah, it's this ideology of this victimhood mentality which they've instilled in the black community.
[01:54:33.556 --> 01:54:38.578]  And these white liberals are the most racist people that you will ever come across.
[01:54:38.798 --> 01:54:41.300]  And the beautiful thing about that story is, well guess what?
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:46.142]  They've set the system in place that if you were to see that, what's the first thing most people would think?
[01:54:46.262 --> 01:54:47.443]  Oh, that must be a Republican.
[01:54:47.743 --> 01:54:51.005]  Because Republicans are the racists, the Nazis, they hate Hispanics.
[01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:55.806]  And the second thing is, they don't even have to mention who she's with because they already have that set in place.
[01:54:56.167 --> 01:54:58.887]  So they can just show, just show, there you go, there it is.
[01:54:59.108 --> 01:55:00.068]  Same thing they do with Trump.
[01:55:00.308 --> 01:55:02.609]  When they run out of stories, what do they do?
[01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:04.329]  They come up with stuff.
[01:55:04.509 --> 01:55:05.870]  Well, is he being impeached?
[01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:07.750]  Is he colluding with so-and-so?
[01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:08.791]  Is this happening?
[01:55:08.811 --> 01:55:11.892]  Tom Arnold says he's going down.
[01:55:13.532 --> 01:55:15.673]  Well yeah, the issue with the white liberals too is,
[01:55:16.457 --> 01:55:18.480]  I don't even know if it's fair to call them racist.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.743]  They just, they hate everybody for a different reason.
[01:55:20.763 --> 01:55:22.024]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:55:22.044 --> 01:55:28.452]  I noticed that liberals, living down at the Ashen for three years, I learned it, they talk crap about, they hate everybody.
[01:55:30.970 --> 01:55:35.192]  I mean, listen, a conservative republic that's successful would know whose people are cleaning cars.
[01:55:35.392 --> 01:55:38.374]  The other thing is, left is so stupid, they're always afraid of everything, too.
[01:55:38.774 --> 01:55:39.334]  Sorry, go ahead, Mike.
[01:55:39.634 --> 01:55:54.162]  Well, speaking of liberals, let's talk about your friend Ron Perlman, who challenged you to a fight and then backed down, and he goes, oh, I urinated in my hand before I shook Harvey Weinstein's hand, and I don't know if you saw that tweet.
[01:55:54.302 --> 01:55:55.863]  No, I didn't even know he backed down.
[01:55:55.883 --> 01:55:56.543]  Oh, I saw it.
[01:55:57.233 --> 01:55:57.653]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:57.953 --> 01:56:02.416]  So he, Ron Perlman, admitted that he knew about Harvey Weinstein and what Weinstein was doing.
[01:56:02.436 --> 01:56:03.477]  And he's such a coward.
[01:56:03.497 --> 01:56:04.638]  Why was Perlman even mad at me?
[01:56:04.958 --> 01:56:11.943]  I saw in the news when he said he wanted to... Fill me in, because I can't keep track of all this stuff.
[01:56:12.243 --> 01:56:13.504]  How did he back down?
[01:56:13.524 --> 01:56:13.924]  What happened?
[01:56:14.604 --> 01:56:14.924]  Well, no, no.
[01:56:14.944 --> 01:56:17.726]  Well, Ron Perlman had challenged you to a fight.
[01:56:18.127 --> 01:56:20.488]  And then we were on your show and we accepted.
[01:56:20.928 --> 01:56:24.331]  And then he backed down and hid and went and, you know, ran away.
[01:56:25.714 --> 01:56:34.178]  Yeah, but so what he did was he tweeted out yesterday, the day before, he said, I was at a charity gala and Harvey Weinstein told me I'd better shave his hand.
[01:56:34.579 --> 01:56:40.362]  So I went into the bathroom and I took a urination on my hand and then I shook Harvey Weinstein's hand.
[01:56:41.182 --> 01:56:43.144]  Again, it just sounds like mental illness.
[01:56:43.965 --> 01:56:44.685]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:56:44.745 --> 01:56:45.326]  Who does that?
[01:56:46.086 --> 01:56:49.309]  But it's also showing this pure cowardice.
[01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:50.830]  Just pure cowardice.
[01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:52.232]  He's thinking he's standing up to the man.
[01:56:52.572 --> 01:56:55.975]  I'm like, what you did was like some passive-aggressive little cowardice thing.
[01:56:56.015 --> 01:56:56.715]  And that's what they are.
[01:56:57.016 --> 01:56:58.617]  They're cowards at their core.
[01:57:00.178 --> 01:57:04.041]  See, I would shake Weinstein's hand and then not let go of it and turn my camera on.
[01:57:04.642 --> 01:57:05.463]  I've done that before.
[01:57:06.223 --> 01:57:08.005]  And start asking serious questions.
[01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:12.704]  Yeah, so the Ron Perlman thing really just typifies everything.
[01:57:13.624 --> 01:57:18.147]  The thing is, they never challenge anybody in their own peer group, right?
[01:57:18.447 --> 01:57:20.308]  They've never asked Bill Clinton if he's a rapist.
[01:57:20.328 --> 01:57:22.309]  They've never asked Harvey Weinstein about anything.
[01:57:22.849 --> 01:57:25.711]  None of these media matters, left-wing, washout groups ever do it.
[01:57:25.971 --> 01:57:30.093]  So Ron Perlman, oh, big tough guy, peed in my hand and shook Harvey Weinstein's hand.
[01:57:30.394 --> 01:57:31.374]  Yeah, way to go, buddy.
[01:57:31.634 --> 01:57:32.955]  Way to show everybody how tough you are.
[01:57:33.015 --> 01:57:34.336]  Plus, Perlman doesn't know the secret.
[01:57:36.058 --> 01:57:39.921]  Even if he was in shape, he might start winning at first, but once he starts hurting me, that's when he gets hurt.
[01:57:40.161 --> 01:57:42.622]  Because I'm not looking for trouble, but he's just a total punk.
[01:57:43.063 --> 01:57:47.506]  We're going to come right back with Mike Cernovich and more, right on the other side, the amazing Lucas.
[01:57:47.566 --> 01:57:49.487]  I want to ask him what he predicts, coming up.
[01:57:54.770 --> 01:58:01.435]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:58:02.495 --> 01:58:02.956]  It's you.
[01:58:07.398 --> 01:58:07.939]  We're good to go.
[01:58:25.282 --> 01:58:36.809]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:36.869 --> 01:58:46.756]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:47.256 --> 01:58:53.661]  And they're trying to use InfoWars as an example of demonization to keep people from sharing this critical information.
[01:58:53.961 --> 01:58:58.245]  It's a model they admit they plan to use on everybody else once they're done with us.
[01:58:58.845 --> 01:59:06.411]  So when you promote the black sheep trailblazing information from NewsWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, from InfoWars.com,
[01:59:07.312 --> 01:59:12.597]  Following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country, we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:13.077 --> 01:59:18.002]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are or where we came from.
[01:59:18.583 --> 01:59:26.250]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:31.275]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:33.076 --> 01:59:35.197]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:35.517 --> 01:59:37.098]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:37.418 --> 01:59:38.959]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:39.599 --> 01:59:41.260]  And many others are across the world.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:42.280]  We are the future.
[01:59:43.201 --> 01:59:44.141]  We are the renaissance.
[01:59:44.681 --> 01:59:45.962]  And we are winning.
[01:59:47.302 --> 01:59:58.727]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:11.959]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.788 --> 02:00:38.829]  The Amazing Lucas is here.
[02:00:38.849 --> 02:00:48.260]  We also have Mike Cernovich, which I'm jealous of at this point, because he really does get under the leftist skin.
[02:00:49.602 --> 02:00:49.922]  See it!
[02:00:50.283 --> 02:00:53.767]  Trump's supporter berates lambscaper because they're Mexican, calls them rapists.
[02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.650]  And animals.
[02:00:56.751 --> 02:01:05.519]  Well, you know, I don't show people all the videos of Hispanic gang members beating up white people or racial attacks of black folks targeting white people.
[02:01:05.559 --> 02:01:06.200]  That goes on.
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:11.045]  But imagine if I ran it hundreds of times and said, black people, don't you feel bad for the knockout game?
[02:01:11.345 --> 02:01:14.708]  No, we've played it, we've talked about it once or twice, but they're going to run this forever.
[02:01:14.748 --> 02:01:16.250]  The point is, there are bad people in every group.
[02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:20.112]  So let's go ahead and roll some of this bizarre video that took place in California.
[02:01:20.132 --> 02:01:24.675]  And like Mike Cernovich said, why is there not a search for who this lady is in this town of 5,000 people?
[02:01:24.875 --> 02:01:27.256]  Because you can tell she's in people's faces all day.
[02:01:27.676 --> 02:01:28.417]  Is she bipolar?
[02:01:28.437 --> 02:01:29.237]  Is she schizophrenic?
[02:01:30.018 --> 02:01:30.898]  I'm not trying to defame her.
[02:01:30.918 --> 02:01:32.920]  I'm just saying she looks like a crazy person.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:33.400]  Here it is.
[02:01:35.239 --> 02:01:36.420]  I don't know why you hate us.
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:37.020]  Why do you hate us?
[02:01:38.241 --> 02:01:39.061]  Because we're Mexicans?
[02:01:40.162 --> 02:01:41.363]  We're honest people right here.
[02:01:43.604 --> 02:01:43.984]  Rapists?
[02:01:44.505 --> 02:01:45.465]  How many people have I raped?
[02:01:46.186 --> 02:01:47.867]  How many drugs have I dealt?
[02:01:47.947 --> 02:01:48.127]  Oh yeah?
[02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:53.330]  You believe everything you see on the news?
[02:01:53.370 --> 02:01:55.492]  You see how we're working hard right here?
[02:01:55.572 --> 02:01:58.654]  Meanwhile, that idiot lady doesn't even know that guy's probably been here five generations.
[02:02:00.007 --> 02:02:09.429]  I don't know any rational person who would behave like that while seeing someone.
[02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:11.290]  Well, but look at her face when she turns the camera.
[02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:13.190]  She has that crazy person look.
[02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:16.591]  Can we get her when she turns the camera and blow her face up?
[02:02:18.171 --> 02:02:19.092]  I mean, she's a loon bag.
[02:02:19.112 --> 02:02:20.552]  What were you going to say?
[02:02:20.572 --> 02:02:25.553]  I don't see how any rational person or insane of mind would behave that way knowing that they're being recorded.
[02:02:26.693 --> 02:02:27.054]  Look at her.
[02:02:28.514 --> 02:02:28.694]  I mean,
[02:02:33.737 --> 02:02:38.002]  That woman is guaranteed, probably has Alzheimer's.
[02:02:38.022 --> 02:02:39.864]  I think like Cernovich said, that's the look of dementia.
[02:02:41.325 --> 02:02:48.413]  And somebody might have wound her up too, like, hey Betty, we'll give you a hundred dollars, you go out and mess with those Mexicans out there.
[02:02:48.453 --> 02:02:49.214]  Well, what do you think Mike?
[02:02:49.254 --> 02:02:50.275]  You're a smart guy, gut level.
[02:02:51.385 --> 02:03:05.349]  Yeah, at a gut level, I think some local teenagers or something, just because we had people like that where I grew up where, um, don't step on the grass, and then you step on the grass and the old, you know, she would come out, you know, exactly, but they call him like the Wicked West.
[02:03:05.369 --> 02:03:13.531]  So growing up in a small town, we actually had two women like that, um, older women and as a kid, this was mean, but you do stuff to them and then blame it on somebody else.
[02:03:13.631 --> 02:03:14.972]  I didn't do it by new kids that did it.
[02:03:15.772 --> 02:03:16.312]  Exactly.
[02:03:16.352 --> 02:03:20.575]  So I bet somebody broke in her house and then said, hey, Betty, it's the Mexicans.
[02:03:21.935 --> 02:03:22.856]  Yeah, they wound her up.
[02:03:22.976 --> 02:03:23.937]  They knocked on her door.
[02:03:24.017 --> 02:03:25.197]  Oh, those are the people I saw.
[02:03:25.257 --> 02:03:26.078]  They were looking in.
[02:03:26.458 --> 02:03:28.779]  That's why you don't see anything before the video or after.
[02:03:28.799 --> 02:03:30.180]  It's just that little clip, right?
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:32.901]  It's like a 29, 31 second clip.
[02:03:33.482 --> 02:03:37.144]  Even though there's still like a conversation ongoing, like she hasn't stopped.
[02:03:37.464 --> 02:03:39.125]  That's the look of the brain shutting down.
[02:03:39.185 --> 02:03:41.046]  Look how the nerves aren't even attached to her mouth.
[02:03:41.766 --> 02:03:42.487]  It's sad.
[02:03:42.507 --> 02:03:43.047]  She has that look.
[02:03:44.332 --> 02:03:55.736]  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a tragedy, so that's why I'm trying to figure out, you know, did some local teenagers harass this poor woman and, you know, just wind her up and lie to her or whatever.
[02:03:56.076 --> 02:03:59.858]  That's why I just want to know why the media is not trying to find out who that is.
[02:04:00.018 --> 02:04:06.260]  And that's why I want to get a bunch of extra reporters hired, and I didn't even plug last hour, and fund ourselves, which is my problem.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:06.740]  I don't plug enough.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.441]  When I plug, we get enough money to fund things to expand.
[02:04:09.321 --> 02:04:12.123]  Is that I'd love to have a crew that like, cause Mike always has great ideas.
[02:04:12.223 --> 02:04:16.987]  Mike Cernovich is always like, hey, Hillary's coming to town, or Bill Clinton's coming to town.
[02:04:17.207 --> 02:04:20.309]  And he just always just, hey, why don't you do CNN's terrorists?
[02:04:20.329 --> 02:04:21.410]  Why don't you, all these great ideas.
[02:04:21.931 --> 02:04:25.313]  And then he's like, hey, he'd call up and say, hey, why don't you send a crew here?
[02:04:26.254 --> 02:04:29.616]  In fact, I can even have you Cernovich's and I have a crew that you direct or something.
[02:04:29.636 --> 02:04:31.438]  It can be the Jones-Cernovich crew.
[02:04:31.558 --> 02:04:32.458]  I'll even pay for it.
[02:04:32.558 --> 02:04:35.120]  I just, cause everything you, every, that's why they don't like you.
[02:04:35.601 --> 02:04:37.162]  Everything you've done is turned to gold.
[02:04:37.822 --> 02:04:38.223]  That's what it is.
[02:04:39.028 --> 02:04:45.513]  Well, that's the idea is we could get somebody there to interview the townspeople and hold that picture and say, do you know who this woman is?
[02:04:45.573 --> 02:04:47.775]  But the key is it's got to be done right when it breaks.
[02:04:48.115 --> 02:04:48.796]  Yeah.
[02:04:48.836 --> 02:04:49.717]  Rapid response force.
[02:04:49.737 --> 02:04:50.177]  You have to.
[02:04:50.477 --> 02:04:51.158]  Yeah.
[02:04:51.178 --> 02:04:52.819]  Because then it just spreads like a wildfire.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.781]  Amazing Lucas is in studio.
[02:04:55.982 --> 02:04:57.643]  And of course, the amazing Mike Cernovich.
[02:04:57.683 --> 02:04:58.363]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:11.123]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:05:11.303 --> 02:05:18.945]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:05:19.185 --> 02:05:22.326]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:05:22.526 --> 02:05:30.331]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:05:30.571 --> 02:05:39.556]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:05:39.716 --> 02:05:51.341]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro balancing properties.

[02:06:06.306 --> 02:06:12.535]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:23.571]  The amazing Lucas riding shotgun with myself and Mike Cernovich just made a great point.
[02:06:24.292 --> 02:06:41.676]  Do we forget that even when Rand Paul was running for the Senate, they caught Democrats, and I remember seeing the photos on air and saying, folks gotta go search who this is, who is this in this town in Kentucky, and they found he was, worked for the campaign of the Democrats that he was running against.
[02:06:42.256 --> 02:06:44.137]  And they're out there in hayseed outfits with a
[02:06:44.457 --> 02:06:54.541]  With a farmer hat, and coveralls, or overalls, with signs going, I love the KKK, and I love Rand Paul, and I hates the Mexicans.
[02:06:55.202 --> 02:06:57.983]  And the media showed this, they'll take that and play it and say, see there's Jones.
[02:06:58.203 --> 02:07:00.624]  Like once I said, I don't hate gay people, I love gay people.
[02:07:00.944 --> 02:07:01.824]  I love everybody.
[02:07:02.745 --> 02:07:03.705]  I don't hate gay people.
[02:07:03.945 --> 02:07:08.627]  They edited it and showed a little bitty screen on Colbert, where you can't even see the edit, it goes, I hate gay people.
[02:07:09.208 --> 02:07:11.889]  I mean, I'm telling you man, and so he was making the point that,
[02:07:13.955 --> 02:07:16.578]  They have caught people thousands of times.
[02:07:16.638 --> 02:07:18.180]  They've been caught staging things.
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:18.400]  Yeah.
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:21.303]  I mean, it's not that far, it's not that big of a stretch.
[02:07:21.423 --> 02:07:22.804]  And that's really the scary thing.
[02:07:22.845 --> 02:07:24.626]  Because during the election, what were they doing?
[02:07:24.646 --> 02:07:28.931]  They were planting people in the Trump rallies to cause a problem, to cause a stir.
[02:07:29.131 --> 02:07:30.412]  And it came out in the WikiLeaks, we were right!
[02:07:30.973 --> 02:07:31.433]  Exactly.
[02:07:31.493 --> 02:07:34.216]  So, I mean, like I said, desperate times call for desperate measures.
[02:07:35.057 --> 02:07:38.098]  It would make sense why they would put out a piece like that.
[02:07:38.278 --> 02:07:39.139]  Just reinforce it.
[02:07:39.199 --> 02:07:40.859]  The same thing we have with the police.
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:42.740]  And the video camera comes out.
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:45.621]  And what they said turns out to be just a little bit of a lie.
[02:07:45.641 --> 02:07:49.583]  Remember the NAACP head said that the guy called me all these racial names and did all these horrible things?
[02:07:49.823 --> 02:07:51.484]  The cop lets him off like three things.
[02:07:52.044 --> 02:07:53.184]  The car's not registered right.
[02:07:53.244 --> 02:07:54.025]  All this stuff's missing.
[02:07:54.065 --> 02:07:55.185]  The cop's totally polite.
[02:07:55.205 --> 02:07:56.666]  But here's the thing.
[02:07:56.686 --> 02:07:57.646]  I didn't air that.
[02:07:59.727 --> 02:08:08.754]  We had an article, but I couldn't even air it because I felt like it would create more division, and that's my point I'm making about taking something embarrassing like this and running it over and over again.
[02:08:09.074 --> 02:08:10.455]  Now, did I do the right thing, Mike?
[02:08:10.896 --> 02:08:15.879]  Not ever airing the NAACP head in a major city being a race-baiting, horrible liar.
[02:08:16.860 --> 02:08:33.641]  I can hardly watch it once, because I felt sorry for humanity that they've programmed people to have the cop kiss his ass and then have him lie about the cop and try to get the cop fired not knowing cops all got cameras on them now.
[02:08:33.661 --> 02:08:34.301]  What do you think, Mike?
[02:08:34.321 --> 02:08:35.202]  What do you think, Amazing Lucas?
[02:08:36.243 --> 02:08:41.769]  Well yeah, there was also that case where Sean King falsely accused a police officer of raping a woman.
[02:08:42.409 --> 02:08:45.492]  Millions of people saw these allegations and everything.
[02:08:45.572 --> 02:08:53.861]  So I'm like you where I don't like race baiting and what I found is when you report on too many of these stories,
[02:08:54.501 --> 02:08:54.662]  Yeah.
[02:08:54.702 --> 02:08:54.982]  Yeah.
[02:09:09.378 --> 02:09:14.879]  You do, you know, as journalists we do want to tell the truth and when there are hoaxes we do want to call out those hoaxes.
[02:09:14.899 --> 02:09:15.540]  Well, here's an example.
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.740]  We used to run our own comments until about five, six years ago.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:20.381]  And when somebody threatened the president, Secret Service would show up.
[02:09:20.441 --> 02:09:23.181]  So I said, hey, let's go with a third party thing like Discus.
[02:09:23.701 --> 02:09:25.242]  So I don't have control to see it anymore.
[02:09:25.282 --> 02:09:34.264]  But back then, we would go in and see the commenters going, you know, and I can't even, the media showed us up and I can't even say, I can't quote stuff now because they edit it and they cover my mouth.
[02:09:34.784 --> 02:10:00.451]  They would say stuff like, kill the N-words, do all this other stuff, and then they'd have people saying they were black folks saying, kill the horrible whites, we're gonna kill you, and then my IT people, we did videos on this, we had to find them, and it was the same groups of people, and we tracked it back to PR firms, who weren't even hiding their identities, who had what they called sock puppets back then, now they call them bots, and they had hundreds of bots on the sites that would go into a story about fluoride, bad for your children.
[02:10:00.931 --> 02:10:05.474]  And it would just be inward, inward, inward, white cracker head, you know, just huge fight.
[02:10:05.514 --> 02:10:08.256]  And all it was was some PR firm creating division.
[02:10:08.296 --> 02:10:09.957]  I mean, that is, that is crazy.
[02:10:10.137 --> 02:10:10.798]  And that's all you need.
[02:10:10.818 --> 02:10:15.861]  All you need is that one person, that one story, and then you can guilt through association.
[02:10:16.381 --> 02:10:17.042]  That's how they do it.
[02:10:17.302 --> 02:10:18.283]  And it spreads like wildfire.
[02:10:18.303 --> 02:10:20.544]  And they repeat it, repeat it, show it, show it again and again and again.
[02:10:20.604 --> 02:10:21.325]  It's even the news!
[02:10:21.365 --> 02:10:23.486]  Twitter bots put out racial slurs!
[02:10:24.206 --> 02:10:26.488]  And I remember talking to IT and they're like, we should just get rid of comments.
[02:10:26.528 --> 02:10:27.629]  And I said, no, people like it.
[02:10:29.110 --> 02:10:29.850]  Mike, what do we do?
[02:10:29.970 --> 02:10:31.831]  I mean, because I don't want to be too confident.
[02:10:31.851 --> 02:10:32.771]  Humanity's waking up.
[02:10:33.271 --> 02:10:34.291]  The globalists are in trouble.
[02:10:34.371 --> 02:10:36.252]  The UN says we're going to take over the EU now.
[02:10:36.552 --> 02:10:39.033]  The military's going to stop nations that don't bring in the Islamists.
[02:10:39.353 --> 02:10:41.953]  I mean, it's now a world government war against nation states.
[02:10:42.314 --> 02:10:47.355]  People are waking up, but at the same time, I just, at a gut level, I feel like we're not doing enough.
[02:10:47.515 --> 02:10:50.776]  And, you know, I talked to some high-level folks this week who I hadn't heard from in a while.
[02:10:51.596 --> 02:10:53.317]  But they literally asked me, what do you think we should do?
[02:10:53.717 --> 02:10:54.818]  And I was like, are you patting me on the head?
[02:10:54.838 --> 02:10:56.679]  They're like, no, go with your gut.
[02:10:56.779 --> 02:10:57.780]  Tell us what we should do.
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:03.543]  And it was actually very stressful to be told this now that I'm being asked what to do.
[02:11:03.563 --> 02:11:04.604]  And it wasn't condescension.
[02:11:04.824 --> 02:11:06.085]  So what do you think we should do?
[02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:07.045]  They're asking us.
[02:11:07.065 --> 02:11:07.966]  They're listening to the show.
[02:11:08.166 --> 02:11:10.087]  The White House says, what do we do?
[02:11:11.590 --> 02:11:14.654]  Yeah, we have to spread more radical love.
[02:11:15.074 --> 02:11:19.739]  A lot of people have noticed that when you insult me now, I say, I love you.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.600]  God loves you.
[02:11:20.701 --> 02:11:21.782]  I wish blessings on you.
[02:11:22.162 --> 02:11:24.225]  I used to be known for just body slamming people.
[02:11:24.245 --> 02:11:28.269]  You know, you'd come at me and I would call you, you know, any kind of despicable name I could.
[02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:30.312]  But then I realized that
[02:11:31.495 --> 02:11:36.718]  The energy right now, the demonic energy of the left, is so strong that it's up to the good people.
[02:11:37.459 --> 02:11:38.339]  Always be polite.
[02:11:38.499 --> 02:11:39.160]  Super polite.
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:40.941]  And that's why Mars said he wants you to die.
[02:11:41.021 --> 02:11:41.521]  It's the love.
[02:11:42.181 --> 02:11:43.202]  That's their scare to Kanye.
[02:11:43.442 --> 02:11:43.642]  Yeah.
[02:11:43.722 --> 02:11:44.142]  It's the love.
[02:11:44.262 --> 02:11:44.723]  Absolutely.
[02:11:45.043 --> 02:11:45.963]  And you need to give it to them.
[02:11:46.283 --> 02:11:46.984]  Give them the truth.
[02:11:47.424 --> 02:11:47.644]  Do it.
[02:11:47.944 --> 02:11:48.185]  Do it.
[02:11:48.305 --> 02:11:48.545]  You know?
[02:11:49.704 --> 02:11:50.264]  Do with love.
[02:11:50.405 --> 02:11:57.670]  So what do I do if I'm sitting with my family at brunch and people walk over and go, you're a racist, you're a terrorist, you're going down Jones, it won't stop.
[02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.491]  What do I do?
[02:11:58.511 --> 02:12:02.714]  I guess I get up like Kanye did when he was at TMZ and just go, I love you, I love you, whatever I did, I'm sorry.
[02:12:03.595 --> 02:12:04.095]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:04.956 --> 02:12:06.277]  However you took it wrong, I'm sorry.
[02:12:06.817 --> 02:12:07.718]  That's what I've been thinking.
[02:12:08.018 --> 02:12:10.380]  Because even though I didn't really do what they're saying, I'm going to say I'm sorry.
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:15.965]  Yeah, because if you act, if you do anything remotely that they would find aggressive, that's, it's done.
[02:12:16.085 --> 02:12:16.605]  It's game over.
[02:12:16.625 --> 02:12:17.726]  Because that's what they're aiming for.
[02:12:17.746 --> 02:12:19.167]  That's what they want you to do.
[02:12:19.308 --> 02:12:21.810]  Oh sure, they get, they get happy when I go F you, you know.
[02:12:23.151 --> 02:12:26.093]  And I button some big guy doing it, because then, you know, that really triggers me.
[02:12:26.133 --> 02:12:28.135]  Some big guys, you know, saying, I'm like, oh really?
[02:12:28.155 --> 02:12:31.098]  You know, and then they like laugh and, you know, get off on it.
[02:12:31.118 --> 02:12:32.379]  So what do I do, Cernovich?
[02:12:33.291 --> 02:12:34.612]  Yeah, no, that's what I've been doing.
[02:12:34.732 --> 02:12:45.683]  I tell people, I love you, you're amazing, God loves you, I want blessings on you, I say, like, I hope the universe blesses you, I wish abundance on you and your life and your family, and then they're like, wait, wait, wait, what?
[02:12:45.703 --> 02:12:46.084]  That's the answer.
[02:12:46.724 --> 02:12:46.924]  Yeah.
[02:12:47.325 --> 02:12:57.595]  But then, what do you do if it's a mob forming, like, because I've had it in Seattle, where Zimmerman's like, but we gotta stop, and then a guy tried to run me over and they were forming mobs, and we had to stay in the hotel the last day.
[02:12:58.786 --> 02:13:09.961]  Well, yeah, we always want to film, because I was attacked by a guy actually at Austin a year ago, and I punched him, you know, he went to punch me, missed, I swung, punched him right in front of the police.
[02:13:10.342 --> 02:13:13.827]  The cop goes, you're all right, I saw everything that happened and we just escorted out.
[02:13:14.347 --> 02:13:19.011]  So yeah, the cameras are your best friends because they will lie and they will false flag you.
[02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:22.034]  So definitely... Oh, that happened to me three times in Hawaii.
[02:13:22.494 --> 02:13:27.238]  All three women came over and said, you're a racist, you're a Russian, you're a Sandy Hook denier, you hurt the children.
[02:13:27.558 --> 02:13:29.360]  And then I would say, hey, let's be nice.
[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:30.101]  I had tried that.
[02:13:30.141 --> 02:13:31.021]  I said, let's shake hands.
[02:13:31.241 --> 02:13:32.062]  They go, security!
[02:13:32.082 --> 02:13:32.663]  Get away from me!
[02:13:32.683 --> 02:13:33.163]  Security!
[02:13:34.504 --> 02:13:34.845]  Wow.
[02:13:34.865 --> 02:13:37.647]  And I'm sitting in the restaurant with like the bartender looking like laughing at her.
[02:13:38.578 --> 02:13:38.938]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:38.978 --> 02:13:40.360]  That's why I just tell them, I say, you know what?
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:41.141]  God loves you.
[02:13:41.541 --> 02:13:43.724]  I wish nothing but the best for you and your family.
[02:13:44.304 --> 02:13:46.247]  And, you know, always have cameras.
[02:13:46.627 --> 02:13:47.848]  You know, you always have cameras.
[02:13:47.888 --> 02:13:51.332]  Like some, yeah, the Potbelly Goblin or whatever is in your face.
[02:13:52.273 --> 02:13:57.679]  Yeah, it's hard not to do it, but the way... Bernie Sanders guy kept bumping me, saying, stop bumping me.
[02:13:57.699 --> 02:13:58.380]  That's another thing they do.
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:13:58.901]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:59.878 --> 02:14:01.820]  Well, we're winning the moral high road.
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:05.042]  So our job is to be impeccable.
[02:14:05.443 --> 02:14:06.704]  I've even cleaned up my image.
[02:14:06.804 --> 02:14:11.067]  You know, you used to see me in gym clothes all the time and never really cared about my hair.
[02:14:12.048 --> 02:14:14.010]  But we have to just present an impeccable image.
[02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:15.851]  We have to respect the leadership position we're in.
[02:14:16.112 --> 02:14:19.374]  Like yesterday, I went on air, I had a really bad headache, allergies or whatever.
[02:14:19.414 --> 02:14:26.680]  I just wore a t-shirt and I changed the middle of the show and put a sports jacket on because I knew the White House and the campaign and everybody were actually
[02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:28.421]  Let me ask you this, though.
[02:14:28.461 --> 02:14:38.044]  We'll do one more segment with both of you, but I don't want to get into inside baseball stuff, but what do you make of high-level folks asking InfoWars, what do you think we should do, what comes next?
[02:14:38.184 --> 02:14:40.085]  And it's not a thing to pat us on the head.
[02:14:40.385 --> 02:14:45.527]  They're literally asking me what they think we should do, because they know our track record is so accurate predicting things.
[02:14:46.887 --> 02:14:50.628]  Yeah, well, and they also know that, you know, the audience is massive.
[02:14:50.668 --> 02:14:53.149]  You know, five to ten million people listen in every day.
[02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:55.110]  So that shows that they're
[02:14:56.064 --> 02:15:07.676]  They're waking up and they're learning who their friends are and who their friends aren't because a lot of people didn't know this, but Paul Ryan is actually trying to get an amnesty bill passed as a way to suppress Trump voter turnout.
[02:15:07.716 --> 02:15:10.519]  That way he can help lead the impeachment against Trump.
[02:15:10.539 --> 02:15:14.463]  Trey Gowdy, they finally realized what I've said many times on your show.
[02:15:14.484 --> 02:15:15.124]  You said it first.
[02:15:15.144 --> 02:15:15.925]  You said he was a mole.
[02:15:17.086 --> 02:15:17.246]  Yeah.
[02:15:18.467 --> 02:15:19.068]  So that's it.
[02:15:19.088 --> 02:15:20.009]  That's what they said.
[02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:22.993]  Is that, man, it was like we were right about that.
[02:15:23.034 --> 02:15:25.938]  I mean, we know what they're planning because we read what they say.
[02:15:25.958 --> 02:15:29.503]  And it's like they're up in that bubble up there and they just can't believe how accurate we've been.
[02:15:29.523 --> 02:15:30.464]  And I'm not trying to toot our horn.
[02:15:30.865 --> 02:15:33.909]  Soros and them want to shut us down and you down because they know how accurate we are.
[02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:34.630]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.686 --> 02:15:37.007]  And it's a war on information.
[02:15:37.027 --> 02:15:37.548]  That's what it is.
[02:15:37.608 --> 02:15:38.649]  And you guys are getting out the truth.
[02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:40.570]  And that affects them.
[02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:42.172]  That impacts them.
[02:15:42.252 --> 02:15:43.072]  And they can't allow it.
[02:15:43.092 --> 02:15:43.793]  They just can't.
[02:15:44.193 --> 02:15:45.394]  One more segment with Mike Cernovich.
[02:15:45.414 --> 02:15:47.016]  You're riding shotgun, the amazing Lucas.
[02:15:48.056 --> 02:15:49.518]  It's historic time to be alive, folks.
[02:15:50.018 --> 02:15:54.722]  Find out all about Mike Cernovich's books and his great supplements and more at Cernovich.com.
[02:15:54.802 --> 02:15:57.504]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:15:57.785 --> 02:15:59.066]  If you don't fund us, we will fail.
[02:16:00.888 --> 02:16:04.850]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[02:16:04.911 --> 02:16:12.375]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[02:16:12.435 --> 02:16:18.259]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[02:16:21.681 --> 02:16:24.643]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[02:16:25.683 --> 02:16:26.424]  But he didn't give up.
[02:16:27.705 --> 02:16:28.165]  And he won.
[02:16:29.906 --> 02:16:31.307]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[02:16:32.068 --> 02:16:36.171]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall to get a victory.
[02:16:37.411 --> 02:16:40.634]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[02:16:41.754 --> 02:16:42.655]  And they all died.
[02:16:42.895 --> 02:16:44.216]  All 180 plus men.
[02:16:46.257 --> 02:16:49.600]  The seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[02:16:51.221 --> 02:16:55.464]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[02:16:55.644 --> 02:16:57.265]  But I know this.
[02:16:59.807 --> 02:17:04.332]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced.
[02:17:05.292 --> 02:17:12.319]  With this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:20.087]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[02:17:21.587 --> 02:17:25.291]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[02:17:26.192 --> 02:17:33.759]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[02:17:36.162 --> 02:17:45.651]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[02:17:48.035 --> 02:17:51.398]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[02:17:52.399 --> 02:17:54.540]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[02:17:54.921 --> 02:17:57.123]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[02:17:58.464 --> 02:17:58.664]  PQQ.
[02:17:58.684 --> 02:17:58.884]  Go Q10.
[02:18:01.152 --> 02:18:08.819]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:10.961]  They sell PQQ in little bottles.
[02:18:11.462 --> 02:18:21.871]  The third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[02:18:22.964 --> 02:18:24.465]  Think about that.
[02:18:24.545 --> 02:18:25.366]  It's $74 right now.
[02:18:26.326 --> 02:18:31.289]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:33.591]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[02:18:33.631 --> 02:18:41.996]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[02:18:42.316 --> 02:18:44.038]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[02:18:45.038 --> 02:18:50.819]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product.
[02:18:50.839 --> 02:18:52.059]  So I'm not gambled.
[02:18:52.639 --> 02:18:53.500]  I know you want value.
[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:55.240]  So we've bought even more of it.
[02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:58.240]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it.
[02:18:58.801 --> 02:19:05.322]  And we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:19:05.962 --> 02:19:06.682]  DNA Force.
[02:19:06.762 --> 02:19:08.122]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[02:19:08.282 --> 02:19:09.062]  Thousands of them.
[02:19:09.082 --> 02:19:10.543]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[02:19:10.963 --> 02:19:11.923]  It is dramatic.
[02:19:13.149 --> 02:19:20.916]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[02:19:21.657 --> 02:19:30.164]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[02:19:30.704 --> 02:19:37.250]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[02:19:40.149 --> 02:19:45.753]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[02:19:45.953 --> 02:19:46.414]  That's fine.
[02:19:47.855 --> 02:19:48.896]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[02:19:49.336 --> 02:19:50.017]  I'm funded by you.
[02:19:50.257 --> 02:19:51.137]  So thank you all.
[02:19:51.818 --> 02:19:56.802]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[02:19:57.342 --> 02:20:00.084]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[02:20:04.367 --> 02:20:07.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.321 --> 02:20:25.702]  I'm Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:25.742 --> 02:20:27.463]  Mike Cernovich is riding shotgun with us.
[02:20:27.503 --> 02:20:29.044]  We've got the amazing Lucas with us.
[02:20:29.784 --> 02:20:30.324]  Here's the deal.
[02:20:31.244 --> 02:20:38.427]  When you've got David Lynch on your side, the icon of the left, and he was never even a leftist, they just, they can't figure out his work, so they think it must be the best.
[02:20:38.707 --> 02:20:39.547]  And a lot of it is great.
[02:20:40.788 --> 02:20:42.869]  You know, Lost Highway, all of it, Dune, you name it.
[02:20:43.549 --> 02:20:45.970]  But, and he's been on the show, and I've
[02:20:46.610 --> 02:20:49.231]  You know, hung out with him some, but that's all off record.
[02:20:50.092 --> 02:20:53.894]  Lynch is, there's Lynch in public and there's the Lynch, you know, behind the scenes.
[02:20:53.934 --> 02:20:54.654]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:20:54.954 --> 02:20:55.735]  I like Gore Vidal.
[02:20:56.215 --> 02:21:00.197]  He was very interesting behind the scenes versus what he was on the scenes.
[02:21:01.458 --> 02:21:02.778]  But all that will go to my grave.
[02:21:02.798 --> 02:21:08.682]  I could come in with David Lynch or anything with Gore Vidal or anything with, you know, the Stanley Kubrick stuff.
[02:21:08.722 --> 02:21:13.384]  I'm just saying, Hollywood is a tyranny and the people under it don't want to be part of it.
[02:21:13.404 --> 02:21:14.084]  And there's a revolt.
[02:21:14.124 --> 02:21:14.945]  And I'm just going to tell you this.
[02:21:16.223 --> 02:21:32.931]  Kurt Russell, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood, all those people and some big producers are really trying to crack Hollywood right now and bring it back, but bring it back just from an Americana view.
[02:21:32.951 --> 02:21:37.293]  So when you see Kanye and all this, that's what's going on beneath the surface.
[02:21:38.073 --> 02:21:43.336]  And, you know, Kanye West has been looking to go on other big Liberty Bay shows.
[02:21:44.329 --> 02:21:49.754]  And I know from folks that talked to him that they threatened to Baker Act him again.
[02:21:49.814 --> 02:21:51.215]  So that's the point.
[02:21:51.235 --> 02:21:52.896]  We all need to show courage in the face of this.
[02:21:52.936 --> 02:21:57.880]  Amazing Lucas, Mike Cernovich, I wanted to ask you in a minute too, you were saying some solution ideas, what Trump needs to do.
[02:21:58.241 --> 02:22:00.543]  Not some stunts, but some things that really illustrate what's happening.
[02:22:00.563 --> 02:22:03.025]  But Amazing Lucas, what would you call this period we're in right now?
[02:22:04.964 --> 02:22:06.305]  I would say a revolution, honestly.
[02:22:07.145 --> 02:22:08.066]  Because that's what's happening.
[02:22:08.126 --> 02:22:09.866]  We're taking back America.
[02:22:10.287 --> 02:22:21.011]  Because when it comes to the media, everywhere they're at, the media, Hollywood, magazines, print, TV, we need to be right there behind them instead of putting out the truth.
[02:22:21.911 --> 02:22:25.373]  And people see that contrast, they'll wake up.
[02:22:26.317 --> 02:22:28.879]  And they know when they call us right-wing Nazis.
[02:22:28.939 --> 02:22:31.941]  Anybody that's watched knows that I'm not even a conservative.
[02:22:32.002 --> 02:22:35.865]  I'm like a common sense, prosperity, pro-America guy.
[02:22:35.885 --> 02:22:38.547]  How would you define yourself?
[02:22:38.567 --> 02:22:41.109]  It's not about talking about ourselves, but they're always trying to define us.
[02:22:41.409 --> 02:22:44.591]  So I think part of victory is defining who we are.
[02:22:44.631 --> 02:22:46.073]  Yeah, I've been called a Nazi.
[02:22:48.474 --> 02:22:48.855]  Jesus.
[02:22:49.075 --> 02:22:50.356]  What did you say to the moron when they said it?
[02:22:51.177 --> 02:22:52.698]  I was dumbfounded.
[02:22:53.198 --> 02:22:55.260]  I was just like, what?
[02:22:57.895 --> 02:23:01.478]  That's all you can say, because they're so gone that they truly believe it.
[02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:04.601]  Mike, how would you define yourself?
[02:23:06.282 --> 02:23:07.744]  I get that all the time.
[02:23:07.764 --> 02:23:08.344]  I'm like, dude, I'm in a...
[02:23:10.046 --> 02:23:12.868]  My daughter, you know, they're like, oh, you hate minorities.
[02:23:12.888 --> 02:23:17.790]  I'm like, well, my daughter is, you know, you know, not that it matters or whatever, but it's just so weird.
[02:23:18.531 --> 02:23:20.232]  That's the thing that I that I learned about.
[02:23:20.252 --> 02:23:25.454]  There are some lessons, you know, maybe we're digressing, but, you know, Alex mentioned covering his mouth earlier.
[02:23:25.474 --> 02:23:28.876]  There are some lessons that I wish that I had known early on.
[02:23:28.916 --> 02:23:29.737]  So anybody listening?
[02:23:30.097 --> 02:23:39.222]  I once read a dramatic reading of Charles Manson's book and not realizing because I was naive at the time how they'll edit stuff and pretend that you actually really said that.
[02:23:40.235 --> 02:23:45.860]  And defining myself, I go, oh, they call me this, you're right, I'm that, sarcastically.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:51.684]  So what they do is they'll edit anything you say to try to define you as what you're not.
[02:23:51.704 --> 02:23:52.605]  Because me, I'm not.
[02:23:53.886 --> 02:23:57.028]  See, we're your friends, though, and so is everybody else who knows who you are.
[02:23:57.368 --> 02:24:00.851]  So when they took those edited tapes on you, notice I didn't turn against you.
[02:24:01.171 --> 02:24:03.093]  And it wasn't it wasn't in the
[02:24:03.937 --> 02:24:06.518]  It was because I know you're real, and I know what they do, but exactly.
[02:24:06.898 --> 02:24:10.200]  When I repeat what they say now, I have to cover my mouth, because they'll edit it.
[02:24:11.941 --> 02:24:13.842]  Yeah, I do big hand gestures now.
[02:24:14.262 --> 02:24:16.683]  Whenever I do that, whenever I do videos now.
[02:24:16.703 --> 02:24:17.904]  That messes up their jump cuts.
[02:24:17.924 --> 02:24:18.304]  God.
[02:24:18.644 --> 02:24:18.804]  Yeah.
[02:24:18.844 --> 02:24:22.226]  And again, the tricks they use, though, when you're ever watching a show, they'll have a little screen.
[02:24:22.866 --> 02:24:28.849]  Like, Colbert will turn to it, and I'll say, I can't even say it, you know, I hate the gay people, I hate the black people.
[02:24:29.149 --> 02:24:31.390]  And it's just edited stuff, and then they just put it up there.
[02:24:33.081 --> 02:24:35.003]  And that's why I worry about it.
[02:24:52.093 --> 02:24:55.394]  Well, I was saying that's why I'm worrying about your friend, you know, riding shotgun and stuff.
[02:24:55.734 --> 02:24:56.854]  You're gonna become a target now.
[02:24:57.735 --> 02:25:01.135]  Media matters is gonna, you know, smear you and everything.
[02:25:01.155 --> 02:25:02.636]  But you have no other choice, though.
[02:25:02.716 --> 02:25:07.117]  Yeah, talk about why you got off the... I mean, you didn't get off the fence, but you had your own career and why you went public.
[02:25:07.137 --> 02:25:08.678]  Yeah, I was doing 3D animation.
[02:25:08.738 --> 02:25:11.538]  You know, I've always had a conservative head and conservative upbringing.
[02:25:11.558 --> 02:25:13.419]  And, you know, I was...
[02:25:13.999 --> 02:25:20.144]  Didn't really care anything about the eight years of Obama because Obama could have done anything and they would have just like, oh, it's the greatest thing ever.
[02:25:20.644 --> 02:25:30.011]  But what I realize is when Trump came into office, during the administration, during his inauguration, they were talking about, well, that his speech was reminding me of a dictator.
[02:25:30.431 --> 02:25:31.092]  A dictator?
[02:25:31.472 --> 02:25:32.173]  I heard the speech.
[02:25:32.193 --> 02:25:33.654]  I was like, OK, that's interesting.
[02:25:33.934 --> 02:25:35.295]  America's coming together.
[02:25:35.415 --> 02:25:36.236]  We love each other.
[02:25:36.596 --> 02:25:40.222]  Yeah, and then it got to the point of being petty with the crowd size.
[02:25:40.502 --> 02:25:42.025]  Oh, he's lying about the crowd size.
[02:25:42.065 --> 02:25:44.188]  What else could he be lying about in the administration?
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:51.103]  The man hasn't even stepped foot in the Oval Office, and you're just already attacking him?
[02:25:51.584 --> 02:25:54.005]  And then it got to the, well, the MLK bust.
[02:25:54.065 --> 02:25:54.666]  He removed it.
[02:25:54.706 --> 02:25:55.666]  You see, he's a racist.
[02:25:55.686 --> 02:25:57.567]  I was like, let me find out.
[02:25:57.788 --> 02:25:58.588]  That didn't happen.
[02:25:58.988 --> 02:26:01.450]  And it's just been an attack after attack, a myriad of attacks.
[02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:02.230]  I'm like, hold up.
[02:26:02.891 --> 02:26:09.034]  If they can attack the President of the United States like this, and no one wants to mention that if Hillary Clinton had won,
[02:26:10.095 --> 02:26:11.036]  Mom would have been the word.
[02:26:11.076 --> 02:26:13.397]  We wouldn't have found out about any of this.
[02:26:13.457 --> 02:26:15.158]  And that's where they miscalculated, I agree.
[02:26:15.358 --> 02:26:15.858]  Exactly.
[02:26:15.878 --> 02:26:16.979]  You're going to keep riding shotgun.
[02:26:16.999 --> 02:26:25.944]  We've got a liberal journalist slash lawyer coming on who is pointing out this whole thing at the border is a hoax as well.
[02:26:26.664 --> 02:26:27.404]  So that's coming up.
[02:26:27.464 --> 02:26:33.588]  But let me just ask you in closing, Mike, as you told me some inside baseball during the break, we won't get into who you met with, but you were advising them on
[02:26:34.591 --> 02:26:37.814]  What you thought would be good things for the President to do.
[02:26:37.874 --> 02:26:46.562]  So how does the President get ahead of them trying to cause a race war, a culture war, that they're going to disguise as left versus right, but it's really a race war, led by a bunch of weird white people.
[02:26:46.602 --> 02:26:48.684]  I'm not just saying it's a virtue signal, it's a bunch of damn white people.
[02:26:48.864 --> 02:26:49.946]  Liberal white people are the problem.
[02:26:51.847 --> 02:26:52.688]  How do we stop that?
[02:26:52.748 --> 02:26:53.569]  What does Trump need to do?
[02:26:53.589 --> 02:26:56.532]  Because we're in some serious situations here.
[02:26:57.802 --> 02:27:17.709]  Right, so while I don't want to be, you know, taken out of context by the fake news media, I will say that when ordinary Trump supporters now face the kind of attacks that you and I and Lucas and so many other people do, that maybe now they're realizing, oh, the left isn't going to stop with the so-called French figures.
[02:27:18.249 --> 02:27:21.210]  They're going to go after everybody and they're going to go after your children.
[02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:26.091]  So what they need to do, what Trump needs to do is... I've always been critical.
[02:27:26.111 --> 02:27:29.992]  So when people call me an apologist for Trump, I go, wow, you've never watched my videos.
[02:27:30.112 --> 02:27:37.014]  I've always said that Trump has never tweeted about how if you wear a red hat in public and you get a brick thrown in your face, he doesn't care.
[02:27:37.254 --> 02:27:41.955]  But if Alec Baldwin makes fun of him, or... And that's Trump's biggest failing, and I forgot to tell him that.
[02:27:43.227 --> 02:27:47.168]  The fact that he doesn't make a big deal out of it, he always goes, we're tough, we're great, we're winning.
[02:27:47.468 --> 02:27:55.830]  He doesn't want to act like his people are under attack, but the people want him to come out and say, God bless people that have stood up against this crap and this intimidation.
[02:27:55.870 --> 02:28:05.571]  He could open the discussion with giving the names of ICE, putting dead animals on their property, saying attack their children, and expand that out to America and say, God bless you, I appreciate your courage.
[02:28:05.811 --> 02:28:08.412]  He always just says, you're smart, you're smart, you know what I'm doing.
[02:28:09.955 --> 02:28:11.817]  Yeah, and then he tweets about Jimmy Fallon.
[02:28:12.118 --> 02:28:13.900]  You know, get your head in the game, bro.
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:15.202]  Act like a leader.
[02:28:15.502 --> 02:28:16.803]  If your followers are under attack... No, I agree.
[02:28:16.844 --> 02:28:18.626]  Jimmy Fallon and all those guys don't exist.
[02:28:19.347 --> 02:28:24.092]  You need to talk about how these people are criminals and how they're liars and how they've been caught.
[02:28:24.172 --> 02:28:24.373]  I agree.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:29.063]  And hate crime prosecutions against Antifa, the far left.
[02:28:29.083 --> 02:28:37.110]  We need Jeff Sessions to begin prosecuting these domestic terrorists before they go like William Myers, who was Barack Obama's mentor.
[02:28:37.130 --> 02:28:39.232]  There'll be weather underground, bombings.
[02:28:39.332 --> 02:28:41.915]  Mike Cernovich, I got other guests coming up, but I'm going to do two more minutes with you.
[02:28:41.935 --> 02:28:42.395]  You've got to hold.
[02:28:42.695 --> 02:28:47.560]  You've always got some big inside baseball resources on the next thing, just like InfoWars does.
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:49.501]  Tomorrow's news today, I want to hear other little
[02:28:50.282 --> 02:28:54.243]  Ted Betz, because you'll let me lead the show, but I want you to just tell us what else is on your radar.
[02:28:54.323 --> 02:28:56.444]  The Amazing Lucas is here, and we've got more coming up.
[02:28:56.464 --> 02:29:00.365]  Stay with us.
[02:29:00.885 --> 02:29:04.346]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:29:04.846 --> 02:29:07.607]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:29:08.147 --> 02:29:13.969]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:29:14.409 --> 02:29:17.190]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:21.372]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:29:21.732 --> 02:29:27.816]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:29:28.217 --> 02:29:33.180]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:29:33.925 --> 02:29:37.326]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:29:37.846 --> 02:29:44.387]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:29:45.047 --> 02:29:49.728]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:29:50.268 --> 02:29:55.369]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:29:55.949 --> 02:29:59.910]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:30:01.078 --> 02:30:04.080]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[02:30:04.361 --> 02:30:04.641]  Go ahead.
[02:30:04.861 --> 02:30:10.465]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[02:30:10.646 --> 02:30:11.747]  I'd done the War Room.
[02:30:12.067 --> 02:30:14.509]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[02:30:14.529 --> 02:30:16.090]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.750]  I was exhausted.
[02:30:17.071 --> 02:30:20.353]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[02:30:20.694 --> 02:30:25.317]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[02:30:25.417 --> 02:30:27.439]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[02:30:27.499 --> 02:30:28.240]  The same thing.
[02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:30.141]  I'm having a full day here at InfoWars.
[02:30:30.161 --> 02:30:31.562]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[02:30:31.742 --> 02:30:33.583]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:30:33.863 --> 02:30:39.846]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[02:30:39.906 --> 02:30:40.907]  You can sleep with it.
[02:30:41.287 --> 02:30:45.610]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:30:45.650 --> 02:30:48.451]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:30:48.611 --> 02:30:50.312]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:30:50.432 --> 02:30:51.113]  It really works.
[02:30:51.333 --> 02:30:55.935]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[02:30:56.316 --> 02:30:58.457]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods, believe me.
[02:31:00.802 --> 02:31:22.489]  If you like the expanded coverage at InfoWars, if you're enjoying the Real News with David Knight in the mornings, the iconic Alex Jones Show midday, and of course the War Room with my colleague Owen Schroyer, please remember that we are completely listener and viewer supported here at InfoWars, and we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced.
[02:31:23.487 --> 02:31:38.833]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[02:31:39.333 --> 02:31:49.257]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[02:31:49.877 --> 02:31:53.019]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[02:31:53.099 --> 02:31:53.379]  Why?
[02:31:53.659 --> 02:31:58.901]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter and he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[02:31:59.461 --> 02:32:01.222]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[02:32:01.242 --> 02:32:03.403]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[02:32:03.703 --> 02:32:08.365]  So we need you to go to the Infowars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[02:32:08.426 --> 02:32:18.030]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine.
[02:32:18.570 --> 02:32:26.212]  In practice for centuries, combining it with cutting-edge new nutraceuticals to bring you formulas that are really effective.
[02:32:26.812 --> 02:32:29.713]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[02:32:30.173 --> 02:32:36.395]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials, where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[02:32:36.675 --> 02:32:38.956]  When you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself.
[02:32:39.376 --> 02:32:41.056]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360 degree win.
[02:32:43.457 --> 02:32:50.161]  You win, and we win, because Alex Jones pumps the money back into InfoWars to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.082]  So please, folks, do us a favor.
[02:32:52.322 --> 02:32:53.282]  Do yourself a favor.
[02:32:53.582 --> 02:32:55.003]  Stand up for the First Amendment.
[02:32:55.423 --> 02:32:58.045]  Kick George Soros right in the derriere.
[02:32:58.465 --> 02:33:00.106]  Go to the website now.
[02:33:03.828 --> 02:33:06.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.612 --> 02:33:23.553]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[02:33:23.914 --> 02:33:26.695]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.155 --> 02:33:35.819]  Alright, Mike Cernovich is always pissing the globalists off.
[02:33:35.879 --> 02:33:36.899]  Bill Maher just joined us.
[02:33:37.559 --> 02:33:42.262]  Said he hopes that his head is cut off, put in an oven, the children eat his face.
[02:33:42.922 --> 02:33:45.723]  And that he commits suicide because Bill Maher called for a depression.
[02:33:45.743 --> 02:33:47.524]  He said economic collapse.
[02:33:48.866 --> 02:33:49.727]  That's not a recession.
[02:33:50.367 --> 02:33:52.609]  And tens of thousands commit suicide during that.
[02:33:52.629 --> 02:33:55.811]  So Cernovich tweeted it, and then he said, I hope you die.
[02:33:56.651 --> 02:34:04.076]  We're going to go to Susan Pye, who is a lawyer, who's nonpartisan, and who's even been criticized coming on the show there.
[02:34:04.096 --> 02:34:09.220]  She was coming on the Thought Police, talking about what's really happening with kids, with the border, and what's happening with Trump.
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:11.602]  We'll talk to him, or talk to her in just a moment.
[02:34:12.542 --> 02:34:14.223]  She's at strongvisa.com.
[02:34:14.403 --> 02:34:17.506]  But finishing up with Mike Cernovich.
[02:34:17.586 --> 02:34:17.786]  Mike,
[02:34:19.471 --> 02:34:20.412]  A lot of stuff on the radar.
[02:34:20.432 --> 02:34:21.874]  You got your big film hoax coming out.
[02:34:21.894 --> 02:34:23.056]  I've talked to people that are involved in film.
[02:34:23.096 --> 02:34:24.037]  They say it's amazing.
[02:34:24.377 --> 02:34:25.639]  The crew, the people.
[02:34:26.159 --> 02:34:29.964]  So I look forward to that being a vehicle just to free speech when you and I go on tour together.
[02:34:30.325 --> 02:34:32.848]  We can kind of announce that's coming up here and freak out the media.
[02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:37.712]  Looking at this, just other little tidbits of what you see.
[02:34:37.732 --> 02:34:41.633]  I see this summer and them trying to cause civil unrest.
[02:34:42.134 --> 02:34:47.817]  I see going in with Mueller saying he's accelerating his investigation because now they know the blue wave is a red wave.
[02:34:47.837 --> 02:34:56.741]  I mean, I see real panic setting in as David Lynch and Kanye West and everybody comes out and says Trump could be the greatest president in history with all the peace deals, everything else, the economy coming back.
[02:34:57.201 --> 02:35:00.323]  But let's not be too confident, as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction.
[02:35:00.783 --> 02:35:02.244]  You know, let's not start celebrating yet.
[02:35:03.044 --> 02:35:07.614]  What else is going on and what other little nuggets you've got from inside the administration?
[02:35:07.955 --> 02:35:10.660]  Do you know what Melania Trump's shirt meant or jacket?
[02:35:12.330 --> 02:35:15.172]  Oh, well, what I tell people is it is going to get worse.
[02:35:15.272 --> 02:35:34.164]  And by that, by that, I mean, if you're a conservative or libertarian, and you don't realize that it's going to get way worse, they're going to start going through vote, what they're going to do next, the left, they're going to go through voter donations and start doxing people, going after every regular person.
[02:35:35.505 --> 02:35:37.146]  Sorry, my friend, looks like I got somebody here.
[02:35:37.706 --> 02:35:38.007]  Gotta go.
[02:35:41.175 --> 02:35:42.496]  So that's the next thing that's coming.
[02:35:42.576 --> 02:35:44.256]  It's just total harassment of individuals.
[02:35:45.197 --> 02:35:45.657]  Exactly.
[02:35:47.398 --> 02:35:48.678]  Alright Mike, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:35:48.718 --> 02:35:50.719]  When is the film, Hoax, coming out?
[02:35:51.599 --> 02:35:52.920]  We're going to do a fall premiere.
[02:35:53.627 --> 02:35:55.507]  Hoaxmovie.com for more details.
[02:35:55.587 --> 02:35:56.388]  H-O-A-X-M-O-V-I-C.com.
[02:35:56.848 --> 02:35:57.528]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:58.748 --> 02:35:59.068]  Thank you.
[02:35:59.848 --> 02:36:03.769]  You want to comment on just the moment of history we're in, Amazing Lucas?
[02:36:04.149 --> 02:36:12.371]  The moment of history we're in here, where most people I know that just want the economy back and like America aren't even conservatives.
[02:36:12.431 --> 02:36:15.832]  I mean, I was arrested by George Bush twice for asking questions.
[02:36:15.892 --> 02:36:17.552]  I mean, I was against those wars.
[02:36:18.032 --> 02:36:20.934]  But the left of the day is like crazed, rabid robots.
[02:36:21.034 --> 02:36:24.217]  Yeah, and I think that's the beauty of it.
[02:36:24.517 --> 02:36:30.682]  Because you honestly, at this point in time, you don't have to have any, you know, knowledge of history or the political affiliation.
[02:36:30.943 --> 02:36:33.064]  It just boils down to common sense.
[02:36:34.005 --> 02:36:36.868]  Like, when it comes to immigration, like, common sense.
[02:36:37.328 --> 02:36:41.672]  When it boils down to there being two genders, common sense!
[02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:50.600]  And I think that's where they're losing a lot of their base, because they're just like, yo, you guys have gone so far left that I can't even, I can't even cosign on that.
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:52.782]  And there's a total war on reality, like...
[02:36:53.462 --> 02:36:54.142]  It's your reality.
[02:36:54.162 --> 02:36:55.743]  It's one thing to say there's 50 genders.
[02:36:55.963 --> 02:36:57.003]  Fine, say there's 1,000.
[02:36:57.503 --> 02:37:01.004]  But then don't try to ban mother and father off government forms, because they're hurtful.
[02:37:01.364 --> 02:37:03.505]  It's this idea of your truth.
[02:37:03.885 --> 02:37:06.986]  This moral relativism, which is absolutely cancer.
[02:37:08.727 --> 02:37:15.349]  And when you look at it, and when you confront them on these ideas, they can't defend them.
[02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:16.649]  They're indefensible, that's why.
[02:37:17.169 --> 02:37:17.589]  Absolutely.
[02:37:17.609 --> 02:37:18.750]  Keep riding shotgun with us.
[02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:21.170]  We're going to go to our guest here in a moment.
[02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:22.691]  Just first off, I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:37:23.391 --> 02:37:31.335]  Despite the fact that summer is always the doldrum for funding, even though the audience is record large, even for the summer, people are awake and involved while it's happening.
[02:37:31.675 --> 02:37:33.416]  We're not selling a lot of products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:37:34.189 --> 02:37:36.190]  Well, that makes George Soros and the Globals very, very happy.
[02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:38.111]  And a lot of it's because I'm not cutting ads.
[02:37:38.211 --> 02:37:38.852]  I'm not plugging.
[02:37:38.912 --> 02:37:40.433]  I'm so obsessed with the news and info.
[02:37:40.793 --> 02:37:42.494]  But we're not funded by Soros.
[02:37:42.514 --> 02:37:47.236]  We're not funded by taxpayer money like MSNBC was with banker bailout money and stimulus package.
[02:37:47.537 --> 02:37:48.337]  We're funded by you.
[02:37:48.437 --> 02:37:54.761]  And I came out, my dad's a dentist and oral surgeon from the top place in the country that doesn't want to say their name because they get threatened and harassed.
[02:37:54.801 --> 02:37:57.582]  The top organic fluoride-free toothpaste maker makes our stuff.
[02:37:58.203 --> 02:37:59.643]  But they put 50 cents in each tube.
[02:37:59.763 --> 02:38:02.485]  We put three dollars of product in it.
[02:38:03.248 --> 02:38:05.250]  Okay, yes, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:38:05.930 --> 02:38:11.495]  And it's got the colloidal silver, it's got the iodide, it's got all the real concentrated oils, the peppermint, you name it.
[02:38:11.755 --> 02:38:15.819]  That's why it's so concentrated, even an adult might want to water down the super blue for adults.
[02:38:15.859 --> 02:38:20.843]  The children's doesn't have, you know, the really strong tea tree and stuff in it, and peppermint, because it'll burn their mouths.
[02:38:21.244 --> 02:38:24.487]  And we've got all of it 50% off, one of the record sales on that.
[02:38:24.747 --> 02:38:27.509]  We've got immune gargle, is my dad's name for it, because that's a term.
[02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:33.495]  But what you do is you brush your teeth, you gargle with it, you spit it out, and then, yes, it's a supplement.
[02:38:33.835 --> 02:38:37.659]  Under the FDA and all of it, you can even swallow some of it.
[02:38:37.679 --> 02:38:39.061]  People go, wait, gargle with your spit out.
[02:38:39.321 --> 02:38:40.122]  It's my dad's name.
[02:38:40.362 --> 02:38:43.065]  He named it Super Blue, too, because the toothpaste turns blue.
[02:38:43.465 --> 02:38:47.429]  First it's white, then it turns blue, because it's got real iodine in it that actually turns blue, not red.
[02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:51.213]  Okay, so the point is, it's amazing, and even though immune gargle
[02:38:51.934 --> 02:38:53.635]  But Combo doesn't have reviews, it's just brand new.
[02:38:54.155 --> 02:38:57.496]  Even though Mean Girls was one of our best sellers, a lot of folks were on the fence and don't try it.
[02:38:58.056 --> 02:39:08.019]  So whether it's 16 ounces, or the 10 ounce, or the 1 ounce, or the all of it, it's all 50% off, or get it all together at mfolwardslife.com or mfolwardsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:39:11.929 --> 02:39:15.691]  Joining us is Susan Pye, and she's a first-generation U.S.
[02:39:15.731 --> 02:39:18.452]  citizen, daughter of North Korean refugee.
[02:39:18.912 --> 02:39:19.913]  She worked in D.C.
[02:39:20.253 --> 02:39:20.813]  with former U.S.
[02:39:20.853 --> 02:39:27.616]  ambassador to the U.N., former head of the GSA, former assistant director of operations at the CIA, former commissioner of the U.S.
[02:39:27.656 --> 02:39:28.076]  Customs.
[02:39:28.736 --> 02:39:35.459]  Attorney Pye is admitted to the Washington Bar and practices only federal law, so she's a hotshot lawyer, and from her office in Florida.
[02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:37.500]  And she's also a good-looking lady there.
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.001]  I guess it's politically correct, I can't say it.
[02:39:39.481 --> 02:39:49.214]  She also submitted testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on Humanitarian Immigration and Senate Judiciary Committee members on business, immigration, fraud and abuse.
[02:39:49.714 --> 02:39:52.137]  As an immigration and nationality attorney, Ms.
[02:39:52.157 --> 02:39:54.000]  Pai may appear in all 50 states of the U.S.
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:54.880]  I don't know.
[02:40:12.791 --> 02:40:15.733]  She's somebody that's just willing to come in and just state the facts.
[02:40:16.113 --> 02:40:20.335]  And so telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[02:40:21.216 --> 02:40:23.237]  And the amazing Lucas is riding shotgun.
[02:40:23.777 --> 02:40:24.678]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:40:25.858 --> 02:40:26.779]  Hi, thank you, Alex.
[02:40:27.947 --> 02:40:31.510]  Wow, that's a whole cool, interesting story about your parents fleeing North Korea.
[02:40:31.530 --> 02:40:35.453]  I mean, we've got to have you on about that separately, but we've got a few minutes to break.
[02:40:35.473 --> 02:40:41.839]  We'll come back and get into the details, but in a nutshell, you're out there on Twitter saying, what we're hearing about Trump, is it true?
[02:40:41.919 --> 02:40:47.124]  Just as an immigration lawyer who's nonpartisan, who's worked, I know, with both parties, what is going on?
[02:40:47.184 --> 02:40:48.625]  Crystallizing, what is really happening?
[02:40:50.964 --> 02:41:01.127]  Well, I think that the Democrats or liberals are, they're very apt to just sort of dismiss Trump and Miller and Kelly and Nielsen.
[02:41:01.347 --> 02:41:11.049]  And that's a really grave error because he has been methodically executing his immigration plan with regards to legal and illegal immigration.
[02:41:11.069 --> 02:41:12.590]  I mean, basically since
[02:41:13.833 --> 02:41:27.036]  Seven days into his administration, and I think that the Supreme Court opinion this morning on the travel ban, reinstituting it, indicates a real tectonic level shift in everything.
[02:41:27.616 --> 02:41:41.559]  And people would do well to not so easily dismiss him, or for example, for people like me, to tell me, you know, I don't even know what they're thinking, to tell me that I'm not allowed to come on your show, or any show for that matter.
[02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:44.561]  Well, that's really it.
[02:41:44.841 --> 02:41:55.650]  And if anything, Trump's trying to make the borders more open for people that aren't criminals or bad, which has got some right-wingers mad at him and some of the actual racist groups that we've been watching.
[02:41:56.170 --> 02:42:00.073]  And so what you're saying is that the senior, the top immigration lawyers, is that's accurate?
[02:42:00.454 --> 02:42:01.474]  Or could you expand on that?
[02:42:01.494 --> 02:42:04.977]  Because Trump's all about process and it being transparent and working, right?
[02:42:05.017 --> 02:42:09.661]  I mean, as an immigration lawyer, what are you seeing him do when you say he's methodically implementing it?
[02:42:09.881 --> 02:42:10.582]  It's all right there.
[02:42:11.789 --> 02:42:22.901]  Yeah, it's just the law and rule-making, setting up cases, setting up lots of litigation, which, as you know, is kind of Trump's forte.
[02:42:23.342 --> 02:42:30.650]  But I think people really underestimate, especially Stephen Miller and his role in not only having Trump's ear, but also in
[02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:31.830]  Let's hear about that.
[02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:34.171]  Let's hear about Stephen Miller when we come back.
[02:42:34.191 --> 02:42:36.792]  They're down harassing him in his house.
[02:42:36.832 --> 02:42:37.413]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:00.345 --> 02:43:07.588]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:43:07.969 --> 02:43:15.492]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:15.892 --> 02:43:18.974]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:19.614 --> 02:43:23.877]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:24.257 --> 02:43:28.180]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:31.122]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:31.542 --> 02:43:35.805]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:36.305 --> 02:43:39.327]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:39.767 --> 02:43:54.593]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:43:54.833 --> 02:43:56.134]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:43:56.374 --> 02:43:58.575]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:44:00.163 --> 02:44:04.628]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:44:04.748 --> 02:44:12.697]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:44:13.098 --> 02:44:14.740]  But, here's what you want to know.
[02:44:15.708 --> 02:44:21.651]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:22.331 --> 02:44:25.872]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:26.733 --> 02:44:34.756]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:35.336 --> 02:44:43.000]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:47.569]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:52.099]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:53.172 --> 02:45:08.043]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:08.463 --> 02:45:13.827]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:14.127 --> 02:45:15.668]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:45:15.968 --> 02:45:17.288]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[02:45:17.308 --> 02:45:21.889]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:22.450 --> 02:45:26.651]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:26.671 --> 02:45:28.131]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:28.931 --> 02:45:35.153]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[02:45:35.533 --> 02:45:37.613]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:38.193 --> 02:45:39.774]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:39.794 --> 02:45:40.914]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:40.954 --> 02:45:42.614]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[02:45:45.535 --> 02:45:46.375]  But here's an example.
[02:45:47.196 --> 02:45:54.779]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:54.799 --> 02:45:56.520]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:56.980 --> 02:46:03.163]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:03.843 --> 02:46:08.948]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:09.229 --> 02:46:17.577]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:17.978 --> 02:46:18.999]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:19.079 --> 02:46:21.742]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:22.262 --> 02:46:38.395]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:38.815 --> 02:46:47.779]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[02:46:48.119 --> 02:46:50.140]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:56.002]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[02:46:56.042 --> 02:46:56.642]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:56.702 --> 02:46:57.883]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.915 --> 02:47:16.880]  Yeah.
[02:47:44.355 --> 02:47:53.237]  Susan Pye is a leading immigration lawyer, and she's talking about Mr. Miller, who's one of the architects of Trump's plan.
[02:47:53.297 --> 02:47:56.538]  And I've looked at Trump's plan, and I've looked at what he's introduced to Congress.
[02:47:56.878 --> 02:48:01.300]  It actually opens America up for people that aren't criminals, and people that go through the system.
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:03.840]  The Democrats and Republicans have had a very long, arduous system.
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.681]  He's trying to make it more streamlined, but
[02:48:06.221 --> 02:48:11.744]  No more hidden groups of people, no more 20 million illegals that are, you know, off the radar.
[02:48:11.804 --> 02:48:21.669]  The Democrats use them to launder money and, you know, to me it looks like Trump is really pragmatically trying to fix it, having a pro-immigrant stance.
[02:48:21.729 --> 02:48:24.330]  But that's me reading what he's pushing, what he said.
[02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:28.412]  Susan, what are you saying he's doing versus what we see in the news?
[02:48:30.785 --> 02:48:33.607]  I mean, honestly, I wouldn't call it pro-immigrant.
[02:48:34.568 --> 02:48:38.711]  But I will say that, you know, Stephen Miller is a young man.
[02:48:38.731 --> 02:48:40.232]  He's got the ear of the president.
[02:48:40.592 --> 02:48:50.779]  You know, his young age really belies the vast depth of knowledge, including legacy knowledge, about immigration that he has.
[02:48:50.819 --> 02:48:53.121]  You know, he did all of Senator Sessions'
[02:48:53.901 --> 02:48:55.982]  Let me just stop you there then.
[02:48:56.462 --> 02:49:01.783]  I mean, you're sounding like you're saying that it's a different plan than what they're saying and that you somewhat agree with it or you don't.
[02:49:02.144 --> 02:49:07.225]  For me, when I say pro-immigrant, I mean legal immigrant, streamlining it for good people.
[02:49:07.245 --> 02:49:08.745]  I mean, it's better for good people.
[02:49:09.626 --> 02:49:12.186]  Or give me your view of what Trump's proposing then.
[02:49:12.667 --> 02:49:13.847]  And then get back into Miller.
[02:49:15.652 --> 02:49:22.098]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to hazard a guess about what is in Trump's mind or anybody else in his administration.
[02:49:22.498 --> 02:49:35.991]  I can tell you that they are methodically closing a lot of loopholes that have existed now just because people on the left don't want to admit that there's
[02:49:36.411 --> 02:49:46.295]  You know, asylum fraud or that the United States is the number one destination for asylum seekers as of right now, overtaking Germany.
[02:49:46.315 --> 02:49:49.736]  330,000 asylum seekers in 2017 alone.
[02:49:50.336 --> 02:50:00.459]  And, you know, everybody who goes to immigration court, we know that there are many, you know, fraudulent asylum claims and some unwitting, some malicious.
[02:50:00.499 --> 02:50:04.301]  You know, a lot of people on the left are saying, well, you know, people are just coming here to get a better life.
[02:50:04.341 --> 02:50:04.521]  Yeah.
[02:50:05.021 --> 02:50:09.422]  That's true, okay, but that's not within the definition of a valid asylum claim.
[02:50:09.782 --> 02:50:12.523]  And asylum was never meant to be a blank check.
[02:50:12.963 --> 02:50:25.566]  So, I think in that way, yes, I'm acutely aware that Stephen Miller knows where all the loopholes and, you know, where the fraud and the abuses, not just in illegal immigration, but also in legal immigration programs.
[02:50:25.646 --> 02:50:27.406]  What would the Democrats do?
[02:50:27.486 --> 02:50:30.807]  I mean, they just say, get rid of everything and have no border?
[02:50:30.827 --> 02:50:33.828]  I mean, when, like, Mexico's a war zone?
[02:50:34.858 --> 02:50:36.960]  That's exactly what they're trying to do with Weinstein.
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:38.981]  The bill that they're trying to get passed.
[02:50:40.322 --> 02:50:47.107]  So let me ask you this as an immigration lawyer, who I know has drawn the ire of the left, and I don't even hear what you're saying that would upset them.
[02:50:48.088 --> 02:50:51.711]  What is not accurate about what the media is saying that Trump's doing?
[02:50:53.038 --> 02:51:04.308]  Okay, so there's a big story that just blew up about a Guatemalan mother who lost custody of her child to American-born adoptive parents who are white.
[02:51:05.249 --> 02:51:11.314]  And that's how it was presented in the media, but that's not really all there is to that story.
[02:51:11.374 --> 02:51:16.719]  So just taking that as an example, that woman came here when she was pregnant in 2006.
[02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:23.201]  She left two children behind in Guatemala, and she's been apart from them now for 12 years.
[02:51:23.902 --> 02:51:26.042]  She gave birth to a child in the United States.
[02:51:26.122 --> 02:51:33.584]  She was busted during the Obama-Bush administration working as an undocumented worker at a chicken processing plant.
[02:51:34.185 --> 02:51:41.547]  And then, a few months later, she pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, and she caught a two-year felony sentence.
[02:51:41.807 --> 02:51:45.368]  But the evil white people are taking care of her baby now, so they're bad.
[02:51:46.537 --> 02:51:52.703]  Well, I mean, the adoptive parents, from what I read, hired a lawyer for her.
[02:51:53.023 --> 02:52:01.450]  And then she had no contact with the child for either one or two years, even though she has sisters here in the United States.
[02:52:01.490 --> 02:52:08.136]  So, you know, she's been here for 12 years fighting this case, and the Department of Homeland Security has allowed her to stay here in the United States.
[02:52:08.876 --> 02:52:36.197]  To fight that but meanwhile back in Guatemala, you know, she's got two children who have grown up without a mother So, you know, it's it's not it's not usually black and white, you know There's there's a lot of stuff that's going on and like this morning, you know The Supreme Court has just reinstituted the travel ban not under national security But but under much much broader statutes and that you're a lawyer but isn't Trump just following the law the president has the power to do that any country he wants right and
[02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:41.443]  I mean, he's exercising his presidential discretion, is what the Supreme Court says.
[02:52:41.503 --> 02:52:53.932]  But then the Supreme Court went beyond that and said that not only does he have the discretion to exclude all, you know, aliens from entering the United States, but they even went further to talk about 1182 section
[02:52:56.494 --> 02:52:57.935]  I think it's A. Yeah.
[02:52:58.495 --> 02:53:02.097]  So, if you come to the United States... And that's the thing that the Press Secretary said.
[02:53:02.117 --> 02:53:04.218]  She said, listen, we can't just do whatever we want.
[02:53:04.278 --> 02:53:05.319]  We follow the law.
[02:53:05.699 --> 02:53:06.699]  We can't just do like Obama.
[02:53:06.779 --> 02:53:07.620]  And it's true, isn't?
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:11.362]  From what I watch, Trump is very neurotic about following law.
[02:53:11.762 --> 02:53:13.383]  And that's why he's always saying, change it, change it.
[02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:17.212]  I don't, in my opinion, I don't think Trump is.
[02:53:17.232 --> 02:53:19.214]  I think Stephen Miller is.
[02:53:19.234 --> 02:53:20.876]  I think Secretary Nielsen.
[02:53:20.916 --> 02:53:30.565]  You know, any female who's in law enforcement will tell you that, you know, no woman gets to that kind of a position in the federal government, you know, without being pretty tough as nails and knowing what they're doing.
[02:53:30.985 --> 02:53:44.806]  You know, so, uh, and then there's General Kelly, you know, so, I mean, they, they, I will say that I, I am acutely aware that they know where all of the weaknesses are in the current immigration system.
[02:53:44.846 --> 02:53:46.288]  I think it's fair to say they're just looking out.
[02:53:46.448 --> 02:53:47.789]  For the country like we're a country.
[02:53:47.809 --> 02:53:52.755]  I mean, because the UN wants Europe to just completely open to North Africa and the Middle East.
[02:53:52.815 --> 02:53:53.836]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:53:54.136 --> 02:53:55.657]  We have to stabilize those countries.
[02:53:55.698 --> 02:53:57.139]  They are doubling their population.
[02:53:57.359 --> 02:53:58.320]  They are collapsing.
[02:53:58.741 --> 02:54:06.168]  How does bringing in hundreds of millions of people, who then the liberals put on welfare to not be self-sufficient, help things?
[02:54:06.228 --> 02:54:07.009]  It will sink us.
[02:54:07.390 --> 02:54:08.511]  Why do they want to sink us?
[02:54:10.376 --> 02:54:13.760]  Okay, so like I said, you know, asylum was never meant to be a blank check.
[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:27.498]  I mean, certainly, the underlying core issue that, like, nobody is talking about, that I don't understand, is a global migration crisis that has displaced, I think it's 68 million people, and after World War II,
[02:54:28.679 --> 02:54:31.042]  There were 15 million people displaced.
[02:54:31.182 --> 02:54:36.509]  So this is an issue that can't be... It's not unique to the United States.
[02:54:36.529 --> 02:54:46.181]  It's an international crisis that requires much more than just short-term policymaking or short-term reactions on the part of just the United States.
[02:54:46.821 --> 02:54:56.230]  But as far as like loopholes within the system, you know, I think people like my colleagues think that if we don't talk about what the loopholes are that people won't know.
[02:54:56.250 --> 02:55:03.937]  Well, that ship has sailed, you know, and after this morning with the Supreme Court decision reinstituting the Muslim ban and then even going further than that.
[02:55:04.637 --> 02:55:15.085]  Uh, and saying that, you know, people have to prove, like, affirmatively prove over 60 bases of potential inadmissibility to even be legally entered to the United States with a legal visa.
[02:55:15.625 --> 02:55:27.774]  I mean, people have to understand, my colleagues have to understand that there's no hiding anything anymore, whether it's policies, deficiencies in policy, deficiencies in the law, fraud and abuse, or
[02:55:28.735 --> 02:55:29.796]  You know, anything like that.
[02:55:29.856 --> 02:55:36.362]  I mean, those are all on their radar and they have all been addressed going all the way back to the first week that Trump took office.
[02:55:36.402 --> 02:55:41.467]  So when people say to me, you know, you can't talk about Alex Jones, I mean, I don't understand what they're saying.
[02:55:42.588 --> 02:55:44.410]  People have a very visceral reaction to you.
[02:55:46.001 --> 02:55:52.887]  Well, I tell you, all I know is Tom Arnold said that he met with Trump's lawyer and he was going to spill the beans.
[02:55:52.907 --> 02:55:53.888]  And he admitted it was a total hoax.
[02:55:53.928 --> 02:55:54.749]  He just lied to everybody.
[02:55:54.949 --> 02:55:56.130]  Oh, I'm an entertainer, it's funny.
[02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:57.111]  But they know he's a liar.
[02:55:57.131 --> 02:56:03.217]  And then, oh, this little girl was separated from her parents and we learned that CNN and others knew day one that they went to a family center.
[02:56:03.957 --> 02:56:04.298]  And so...
[02:56:05.808 --> 02:56:07.809]  I know what goes on in Mexico in some areas.
[02:56:08.169 --> 02:56:09.649]  Some areas are nice, some areas are bad.
[02:56:09.889 --> 02:56:13.211]  It's road warrior death in northern Mexico on the Texas border.
[02:56:13.711 --> 02:56:17.472]  And then I get to hear about how I'm a Nazi because I want to control the border.
[02:56:18.052 --> 02:56:24.775]  And it's just, none of these leftists would understand that we'd have no civilization if we allowed Latin America to collapse into the U.S.
[02:56:26.317 --> 02:56:26.898]  I'm concerned.
[02:56:27.358 --> 02:56:29.200]  You've got third-world populations that have doubled.
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:30.461]  They're set to get even bigger.
[02:56:31.222 --> 02:56:32.243]  These countries are mismanaged.
[02:56:32.263 --> 02:56:34.345]  They're falling apart, run by communists and socialists.
[02:56:35.005 --> 02:56:36.867]  And, you know, you were able to flee from North Korea.
[02:56:36.907 --> 02:56:39.149]  Boy, I think your asylum was 100% clear for your parents.
[02:56:39.189 --> 02:56:40.991]  God, any North Koreans can get out.
[02:56:41.071 --> 02:56:41.531]  Come on over.
[02:56:44.036 --> 02:56:44.897]  Because they're fleeing it.
[02:56:44.917 --> 02:56:49.401]  They're not like fleeing socialism or communism trying to come here and shut it up.
[02:56:49.441 --> 02:56:53.664]  It's like Californians are fleeing and they get to Austin and they say, your trucks are too big.
[02:56:53.704 --> 02:56:54.405]  Give us your guns.
[02:56:54.425 --> 02:56:55.366]  We want to raise taxes.
[02:56:55.666 --> 02:56:57.728]  And I'm like, moron, you just left that.
[02:56:57.828 --> 02:56:59.329]  So that's what I'm getting at here.
[02:57:00.470 --> 02:57:00.650]  Ms.
[02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:00.871]  Pye.
[02:57:02.812 --> 02:57:07.036]  Yeah, I mean, on asylum, I think that we would
[02:57:07.782 --> 02:57:23.206]  We would do well to correctly educate people and tell them that, yes, you know, you may be seeking a life for your children, which is the natural inclination of all parents, but that doesn't necessarily mean that, you know, you qualify for asylum, even under the current law.
[02:57:23.626 --> 02:57:25.887]  You're saying don't use your children as a pawn?
[02:57:25.907 --> 02:57:29.328]  Yeah, absolutely not.
[02:57:29.528 --> 02:57:34.849]  I mean, you know, I have a lot of questions of, look, I know lawyers who take
[02:57:35.854 --> 02:57:37.596]  50, 100 asylum cases a month.
[02:57:38.377 --> 02:57:39.478]  I take two a year.
[02:57:39.739 --> 02:57:44.024]  So I have to know that the law and the facts are on my side.
[02:57:44.124 --> 02:57:46.568]  I want to hear about that process back in two minutes.
[02:57:46.628 --> 02:57:48.190]  I want to finish up on how do you take cases.
[02:57:48.771 --> 02:57:49.692]  And Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:57:51.735 --> 02:57:53.116]  Gregory, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:57:53.136 --> 02:57:53.396]  Welcome.
[02:57:53.436 --> 02:57:55.457]  Can I make a plug real quick about bodies?
[02:57:55.557 --> 02:57:56.757]  Like, it really did help.
[02:57:56.777 --> 02:57:56.958]  Please.
[02:57:56.978 --> 02:57:59.199]  I had, like, a real bad pain in my ear.
[02:57:59.219 --> 02:58:04.521]  I thought it was an ear infection, and it turned out to be a joint pain called TMJ.
[02:58:04.561 --> 02:58:05.462]  TMJ, I have it.
[02:58:05.502 --> 02:58:09.624]  And I just noticed one day, like, when I was eating, there was, like, a sharp pain.
[02:58:09.764 --> 02:58:11.925]  I thought, you know, I thought, okay, well, I might go away.
[02:58:11.965 --> 02:58:13.826]  The next two days, it just got worse.
[02:58:13.906 --> 02:58:14.526]  I'm like, you know what?
[02:58:14.546 --> 02:58:18.268]  I'm going to go to the doctor because I can't even go to sleep, and I can't even go to work right now.
[02:58:18.288 --> 02:58:20.289]  So, like, I went to the emergency room every day.
[02:58:20.569 --> 02:58:23.752]  They just told me, you know, uh, we really can't do anything.
[02:58:23.832 --> 02:58:25.993]  All we could do is just give you, uh, antibiotics.
[02:58:26.133 --> 02:58:27.955]  And they were telling me, like, what it was.
[02:58:28.035 --> 02:58:32.959]  The thing he told me is, uh, that, like, you need to take Advil, because Advil has anti-inflammatories.
[02:58:32.999 --> 02:58:37.062]  So when I came home, I'm like, wait, I remember body has anti-inflammatories.
[02:58:37.102 --> 02:58:41.686]  So, like, I started reading it, and then, like, he said it's the best product, so I just wanted to try it.
[02:58:42.706 --> 02:58:43.287]  I took two.
[02:58:43.587 --> 02:58:44.607]  I just remember taking two.
[02:58:44.627 --> 02:58:46.168]  It did hurt that day.
[02:58:46.188 --> 02:58:49.749]  I mean, it was a little recurring, but let me tell you, like I said, it was last week.
[02:58:49.769 --> 02:58:52.050]  This whole week, I haven't, I don't even remember the pain.
[02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.710]  I really don't.
[02:58:52.830 --> 02:58:54.891]  Like, I just go about my business.
[02:58:55.011 --> 02:58:57.512]  Well, that's, I mean, that's what, that's what turmeric's known for.
[02:58:57.572 --> 02:59:00.193]  It's got a bunch of other compounds that are anti-inflammatories.
[02:59:00.333 --> 02:59:02.816]  It's Mother Nature, God gave it to us, and I'm glad you like bodies.
[02:59:02.856 --> 02:59:08.383]  I never really talk about products, and the FDA doesn't want people to even say what they can do, and no one talks about turmeric.
[02:59:08.463 --> 02:59:10.445]  I mean, it's a known superfood.
[02:59:10.506 --> 02:59:13.429]  Well, the average turmeric's 3% curcumin, and ours is 95.
[02:59:13.749 --> 02:59:18.916]  We set out to find the best concentrated system of it in the world.
[02:59:25.947 --> 02:59:28.008]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[02:59:28.508 --> 02:59:36.671]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[02:59:37.011 --> 02:59:39.572]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[02:59:39.972 --> 02:59:43.493]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[02:59:43.813 --> 02:59:44.894]  We need your help.
[02:59:52.990 --> 02:59:57.084]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:57.606 --> 02:59:58.911]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:08.772 --> 03:00:15.074]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[03:00:15.514 --> 03:00:20.016]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States... All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:21.396 --> 03:00:23.017]  Susan Pye is our guest.
[03:00:23.037 --> 03:00:25.417]  She's a leading, well-known immigration lawyer.
[03:00:25.437 --> 03:00:27.978]  She was getting into what's really happening, what Trump's doing versus what we're hearing.
[03:00:27.998 --> 03:00:33.800]  And you were talking about how do these immigration lawyers take hundreds of cases versus you saying you only take two.
[03:00:33.820 --> 03:00:35.421]  I mean, what makes you take one?
[03:00:35.461 --> 03:00:36.181]  I mean, I would imagine
[03:00:36.801 --> 03:00:39.563]  Somebody fleeing Iran who's got proof they're a political dissident.
[03:00:39.903 --> 03:00:41.204]  Somebody trying to get out of North Korea.
[03:00:41.284 --> 03:00:48.069]  Obviously there's going to be a question, at least in my view, or somebody trying to get out of... There's a Christian in Sudan whose parents were killed.
[03:00:48.129 --> 03:00:52.252]  I mean, aren't there a lot of real people need to get into America?
[03:00:53.713 --> 03:00:57.916]  Yeah, so I have a case and my client's giving me permission to speak about it to the public.
[03:01:00.882 --> 03:01:18.722]  You know, she was tortured for two decades, and when I say tortured, I mean teeth were knocked out of her mouth, her eardrum was perforated, her bones were broken, she has scars all over her body, her hand was put in an open flame, and she was- Sounds like high school.
[03:01:19.543 --> 03:01:25.546]  She was tortured by an actual Nazi member of her country's government.
[03:01:25.886 --> 03:01:28.187]  Okay, that's a real asylum claim.
[03:01:28.427 --> 03:01:42.674]  She has to grieve for her son who she left behind and she has to think of him as dead because she cannot turn him away from, you know, her abuser who was her husband in her country but who is
[03:01:43.374 --> 03:01:45.837]  Ironically, in charge of asylum cases in her country.
[03:01:45.897 --> 03:01:55.666]  Now, that's really different than some of my colleagues who, you know, we're lawyers, so all there is for us is the law and the facts.
[03:01:56.347 --> 03:01:58.469]  It's not like our political opinion.
[03:01:58.869 --> 03:02:09.154]  So whether or not we think somebody deserves, you know, a chance in a better country, I mean, I can say that of the vast majority of people, you know, who don't, are not fortunate enough to live in the United States.
[03:02:09.514 --> 03:02:21.401]  But that doesn't mean that I as a lawyer am allowed to file those cases just to get my client work authorization six months after we file, because I know that the case is going to go on for three, four, five, six, eight years.
[03:02:21.761 --> 03:02:25.903]  Well, I was about to say, though, and in a lot of cases, don't you even get government funding for the appeal?
[03:02:28.804 --> 03:02:34.509]  I mean, all federal public defenders can sit on a panel and get compensated by the federal government.
[03:02:34.529 --> 03:02:41.655]  Sure, so these people take on all these cases and they're sitting there doing it, and then if you expand on that, you start thinking about it.
[03:02:42.516 --> 03:02:50.623]  Yeah, I have a problem like with, you know, whether you're an extremist on the right or the left, I mean, it really doesn't matter, you know, you're an extremist.
[03:02:50.683 --> 03:02:53.926]  So, you know, there are extremists on the left who are very
[03:02:55.652 --> 03:03:01.797]  I mean, just because you don't recognize America's borders doesn't mean that borders don't exist, okay?
[03:03:01.817 --> 03:03:03.519]  Borders exist, and I mean, we're a sovereign nation.
[03:03:03.639 --> 03:03:05.400]  Well, I'm not saying genders don't exist.
[03:03:05.460 --> 03:03:07.142]  I mean, I think the amazing Lucas is a man.
[03:03:07.162 --> 03:03:10.364]  I think the amazing Susan Pye is a woman.
[03:03:10.744 --> 03:03:14.768]  And it doesn't hurt anybody else out there that they identify as a potted plant.
[03:03:15.368 --> 03:03:28.433]  The fact is mammals are males and females and you know we have borders and we're a country and there's six billion people that want to come here and you know it's like Ellis Island take our poor Ellis Island will put your ass in solitary confinement for six months.
[03:03:28.913 --> 03:03:30.914]  They thought you were sick you know quarantine.
[03:03:31.454 --> 03:03:37.016]  And so I remember talking to the Border Patrol how they're bringing people in with diseases you name it and now these diseases that weren't even in the U.S.
[03:03:37.036 --> 03:03:38.977]  like leprosy are back it's incredible.
[03:03:40.609 --> 03:03:53.033]  Well, you know, I don't, I know for a fact, because I've been following some of the real extremist elements of Open Borders movement for many, many years.
[03:03:53.173 --> 03:03:59.715]  And I know for a fact that they've come right out and said that we, hey, we use bodies to push our political agenda.
[03:03:59.976 --> 03:04:04.017]  And when they say we use bodies, that means they're purposefully using
[03:04:04.697 --> 03:04:08.079]  Women, children, you know, families.
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:21.408]  And I don't know that the people who are organizing things like the migrant caravan, I don't know that they are, if they're not misleading the people who are... Oh, a lot of useful idiots sign on because they want to go on VirtueSignal.
[03:04:21.428 --> 03:04:22.189]  You're absolutely right.
[03:04:22.509 --> 03:04:28.133]  All right, StrongVisas.com, Susan Pye, thank you for coming on the broadcast and we appreciate your perspective.
[03:04:31.357 --> 03:04:35.118]  We're gonna do one more segment with Paul Watson, with the amazing Lucas, and get his take on that.
[03:04:35.138 --> 03:04:42.639]  Then we got the war room coming up after that, but there is just so much that we've got to go over.
[03:04:42.679 --> 03:04:45.239]  But man, the Supreme Court, I haven't even gotten into that properly.
[03:04:45.299 --> 03:04:48.620]  How the slapdown of them is just epic.
[03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:50.660]  Because the law is crystal clear.
[03:04:51.120 --> 03:04:56.761]  And so all these little sub-judges, they ignored it, but why did the Supreme Court actually follow the clear-cut law?
[03:04:57.521 --> 03:05:00.182]  We'll ask that question straight ahead, and we have Pete J.W.
[03:05:00.202 --> 03:05:00.482]  coming up.
[03:05:05.953 --> 03:05:09.074]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:09.094 --> 03:05:09.614]  You're on the air.
[03:05:09.634 --> 03:05:10.794]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:10.814 --> 03:05:11.654]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:11.874 --> 03:05:12.474]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:12.774 --> 03:05:13.134]  Good, man.
[03:05:13.154 --> 03:05:13.954]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:14.054 --> 03:05:14.595]  Hey, hey.
[03:05:14.695 --> 03:05:19.115]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:19.315 --> 03:05:25.696]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Phylum Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:25.836 --> 03:05:27.517]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:05:27.537 --> 03:05:34.398]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:34.838 --> 03:05:36.039]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:36.099 --> 03:05:40.124]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:40.504 --> 03:05:42.166]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:42.566 --> 03:05:43.307]  And exactly.
[03:05:43.327 --> 03:05:47.611]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:47.912 --> 03:05:48.192]  Boom!
[03:05:48.332 --> 03:05:51.175]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:51.215 --> 03:05:51.756]  It's amazing.
[03:05:51.796 --> 03:05:56.060]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:06:02.182 --> 03:06:04.705]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:04.805 --> 03:06:11.011]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:32.705 --> 03:06:36.547]  Well there he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:36.567 --> 03:06:42.370]  We've got the amazing Lucas.
[03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:44.712]  We've got the elusive Watson.
[03:06:44.772 --> 03:06:47.013]  There he is, the Waddlewart.
[03:07:01.656 --> 03:07:12.099]  Hey, Watson, you've got a lot coming up this hour, a lot of craziness going on, but I was asking some folks in the government, you know, kind of high level the other day, what can I do?
[03:07:12.139 --> 03:07:13.919]  And they said, no, no, what do we do?
[03:07:13.939 --> 03:07:15.559]  And I was like, is that a pat on the head?
[03:07:15.579 --> 03:07:18.320]  And they said, no, your track record, everything you're doing, what do you think?
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:20.661]  And I said, well, they're getting ready for the Civil War.
[03:07:20.721 --> 03:07:21.701]  This is like last Wednesday.
[03:07:22.694 --> 03:07:24.775]  And they're getting ready to try to take down the whole country.
[03:07:25.295 --> 03:07:28.496]  And they're going to cause race riots, calling it Republican versus Democrats.
[03:07:28.516 --> 03:07:29.717]  They're going to ratchet up violence.
[03:07:30.337 --> 03:07:33.839]  And they're going to come out with all their fake Russiagate stuff and try the 25th Amendment.
[03:07:34.959 --> 03:07:39.541]  And I just don't think we can sit here and just beat them with prosperity and truth.
[03:07:40.001 --> 03:07:44.343]  At a certain point when people are saying they're going to overthrow the government, I don't know what we do.
[03:07:45.584 --> 03:07:54.186]  And so I did an analysis the first 30 minutes where I kind of put my best thinking cap on of what we should do, Watson, but you've got the U.N.
[03:07:54.226 --> 03:07:56.747]  and Reuters announcing that they're basically with the E.U.
[03:07:56.807 --> 03:07:57.547]  setting up an E.U.
[03:07:57.667 --> 03:07:59.587]  army to make people accept open borders.
[03:07:59.787 --> 03:08:02.028]  They're going to use the crisis of tens of millions of invaders.
[03:08:02.848 --> 03:08:06.969]  Macron says 200 million is what he wants the next decade, as you know, to take over and have the U.N.
[03:08:07.009 --> 03:08:07.569]  So it's simple.
[03:08:08.564 --> 03:08:19.031]  They orchestrate the collapse of the third world, open up, incentivize people coming into the countries with welfare and everything else, bring them in en masse, and then use them as a political detonator to control the populations.
[03:08:19.111 --> 03:08:21.092]  This is 21st century warfare.
[03:08:21.532 --> 03:08:22.533]  World War IV is here.
[03:08:23.213 --> 03:08:24.454]  Again, the Cold War was World War III.
[03:08:25.695 --> 03:08:26.856]  The Cold War was World War III.
[03:08:27.276 --> 03:08:28.197]  That's where we are.
[03:08:28.277 --> 03:08:29.357]  And the President gets it.
[03:08:29.838 --> 03:08:30.698]  And Miller gets it.
[03:08:30.818 --> 03:08:31.459]  And you get it.
[03:08:31.519 --> 03:08:32.239]  We all get it.
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:39.704]  But at the same time, now they're going into their full intimidation mode, doxing patriots, doxing federal agents.
[03:08:40.745 --> 03:08:41.405]  They're moving.
[03:08:41.505 --> 03:08:44.587]  And I'm not just going to sit here flat-footed.
[03:08:44.607 --> 03:08:46.809]  It doesn't mean I'm launching some operation.
[03:08:47.449 --> 03:08:53.475]  But we have been tasked with, because we are recognized in InfoWars as the Zeitgeists.
[03:08:54.035 --> 03:08:58.900]  And so I will tell you that high-level folks want to know what everybody here thinks.
[03:08:59.401 --> 03:09:00.462]  So Paul, what do you think?
[03:09:02.617 --> 03:09:06.059]  Well, I mean, I get the same thing from over here in the UK, Alex.
[03:09:06.079 --> 03:09:06.860]  You'd be surprised.
[03:09:07.420 --> 03:09:15.105]  Some of the people who you think maybe used to be in the elite or have, you know, one toe in the elite, you know, dipped in the elite, they're totally on our side now.
[03:09:15.545 --> 03:09:17.026]  You got another example of that today.
[03:09:17.406 --> 03:09:18.267]  Conrad Black.
[03:09:18.767 --> 03:09:22.571]  This is a former Steering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:09:23.011 --> 03:09:24.733]  Doesn't get much more elitist than that.
[03:09:25.254 --> 03:09:31.900]  He's come out and said that Trump's basically engaged in a bloodless civil war against the establishment, against the deep state.
[03:09:31.940 --> 03:09:32.741]  You see the clip there.
[03:09:32.761 --> 03:09:34.743]  And that he's basically winning.
[03:09:35.299 --> 03:09:39.061]  This is someone who was in the upper echelons of the elite for decades and decades.
[03:09:39.121 --> 03:09:49.646]  And as you just said, you know, I talk to people in this country who are coming from the same direction, who are kind of, you know, tiptoeing on the globalist hierarchy 5, 10, 15 years ago.
[03:09:49.666 --> 03:09:52.247]  And now they're completely on board because we're winning.
[03:09:52.827 --> 03:10:04.513]  And that's why they're all freaking out and panicking, because they're still... I mean, it's really getting boring, Alex, when I have to make the same videos about the same subjects, because they've gone back to the original rhetoric.
[03:10:05.177 --> 03:10:12.942]  Like with De Niro a couple of weeks ago, he said the same thing, you know, F Trump, that's going to achieve anything in front of a sycophantic audience.
[03:10:13.002 --> 03:10:17.605]  So let me ask you this, and then I'm going to get out of here because Amazing Lucas is here, but this is the point we've gotten to.
[03:10:18.325 --> 03:10:28.172]  I'm not going to get into what's happening in the UK behind the scenes of the EU, but we had the same approach by top people, and they say, we're ready for you and Paul to lead operations.
[03:10:29.216 --> 03:10:32.058]  And these are famous people we're talking to.
[03:10:32.158 --> 03:10:34.120]  We're like, well, wait, we are leading operations?
[03:10:35.061 --> 03:10:36.262]  And then it's the same thing.
[03:10:37.242 --> 03:10:40.285]  So I'm just saying we have to step into that.
[03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:45.150]  And realize that all these beachheads we've got are just those.
[03:10:45.230 --> 03:10:52.152]  And just like we don't realize we're in the catbird seat, our listeners don't realize they are like captains or colonels in this fight.
[03:10:52.332 --> 03:10:54.313]  Everything we do now, people are listening.
[03:10:54.353 --> 03:10:54.833]  They get it.
[03:10:55.153 --> 03:10:55.693]  They know it.
[03:10:55.713 --> 03:10:56.994]  There's a sense of optimism.
[03:10:57.094 --> 03:11:09.558]  But there's a vacuum in leadership in that so many people don't want to then say what we need to do or what needs to happen or what needs to unfold.
[03:11:09.838 --> 03:11:10.738]  So Paul, what do you think?
[03:11:12.705 --> 03:11:14.146]  I think we're doing pretty well as it is.
[03:11:14.186 --> 03:11:15.467]  I mean, why do you think they're panicking?
[03:11:15.947 --> 03:11:17.048]  They weren't panicking before.
[03:11:17.088 --> 03:11:19.690]  They had this blue wave rhetoric that was going on for months.
[03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:24.454]  You know, Democrats 16 points ahead in the race for the House as recently as December.
[03:11:24.774 --> 03:11:26.095]  That's completely vanished.
[03:11:26.455 --> 03:11:29.317]  So as soon as that vanished, they started freaking out again.
[03:11:29.738 --> 03:11:30.959]  What's new about it?
[03:11:31.199 --> 03:11:34.001]  This is what I've noticed over the past few weeks, Alex.
[03:11:34.711 --> 03:11:40.293]  Is targeting children, like literally calling to intimidate and target children.
[03:11:40.613 --> 03:11:45.935]  Not only did you have Peter Fonda, you know, calling for Barron Trump to be put in a cage and raped by pedophiles.
[03:11:46.415 --> 03:11:50.957]  And going out to protest Border Patrol agent schools at which their kids attend.
[03:11:51.477 --> 03:11:55.098]  You also had the Daily Beast out in Pamela Geller's daughter.
[03:11:55.138 --> 03:11:57.639]  She's got an Islamic terrorist fatwa against her family.
[03:11:58.039 --> 03:12:00.000]  Completely exposed them, put them at risk of death.
[03:12:00.420 --> 03:12:02.061]  You have Tom Arnold,
[03:12:02.582 --> 03:12:07.491]  He's this dereight celebrity, washed up celebrity, claims he's got all these secret Trump tapes.
[03:12:08.337 --> 03:12:09.838]  He put out a tweet a few days ago.
[03:12:10.279 --> 03:12:16.143]  He said, next is protesting Barron's private school as well as James and Lachlan Murdoch's kids.
[03:12:16.644 --> 03:12:19.206]  This is what I can do to end the abuse of these children.
[03:12:19.446 --> 03:12:21.287]  We're going to make you uncomfortable.
[03:12:21.588 --> 03:12:25.350]  So they're literally talking about going out and intimidating people's children.
[03:12:25.911 --> 03:12:27.552]  That's where it's reached a new level.
[03:12:27.592 --> 03:12:29.073]  This is the lowest of the low.
[03:12:29.113 --> 03:12:31.115]  So they're trying to launch a violent civil war.
[03:12:31.535 --> 03:12:37.220]  Many experts believe we're already in it and that they're going to try to totally overthrow Europe and here in the next year.
[03:12:39.759 --> 03:12:48.210]  And, you know, going back to what I was just saying, this Sarah Huckabee Sanders story, people say, oh, this wasn't violent, this was just confronting her outside a restaurant, whatever.
[03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:49.892]  No, she went home.
[03:12:50.273 --> 03:12:51.514]  She went home with her husband.
[03:12:51.835 --> 03:12:55.179]  Her family went on to a different restaurant nearby.
[03:12:55.339 --> 03:12:55.999]  They followed them.
[03:12:56.019 --> 03:12:57.200]  Yeah, they harassed them too.
[03:12:57.540 --> 03:13:00.440]  They're not just harassing the Trump administration officials.
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:02.341]  They're targeting people's families.
[03:13:02.601 --> 03:13:03.761]  They're the lowest of the low.
[03:13:03.821 --> 03:13:05.162]  It's absolutely despicable.
[03:13:05.402 --> 03:13:07.142]  And that's not a vote-winning strategy.
[03:13:07.402 --> 03:13:08.342]  It's desperation.
[03:13:08.683 --> 03:13:09.823]  It's a sign that they're losing.
[03:13:10.043 --> 03:13:10.843]  No, I agree with you.
[03:13:10.863 --> 03:13:13.324]  And that's why Schumer and people want to have the cake and eat it too.
[03:13:13.344 --> 03:13:14.704]  They're like, oh, don't do that.
[03:13:14.784 --> 03:13:15.384]  Don't do it.
[03:13:15.464 --> 03:13:17.105]  And then Waters goes, I didn't do that.
[03:13:17.525 --> 03:13:18.965]  And no one's criticizing me.
[03:13:19.025 --> 03:13:19.745]  So I agree.
[03:13:22.225 --> 03:13:28.606]  Mueller and Brennan and all them are still planning a violent coup.
[03:13:28.646 --> 03:13:29.747]  They've said they're planning it.
[03:13:30.047 --> 03:13:31.447]  They want a 25th Amendment as well.
[03:13:31.507 --> 03:13:36.068]  So I agree we're winning, Paul, but I'm telling you, that makes them go into cornered rat mode.
[03:13:36.608 --> 03:13:39.309]  And I'm telling you, they're going to make some major moves.
[03:13:39.329 --> 03:13:40.029]  What do you think?
[03:13:40.149 --> 03:13:40.649]  You're absolutely right.
[03:13:40.669 --> 03:13:41.469]  It gets them desperate.
[03:13:43.149 --> 03:13:45.510]  And when they see, you know, people are turning, it gets...
[03:13:46.949 --> 03:13:49.192]  It's unknown what they're liable to do.
[03:13:49.492 --> 03:13:52.135]  And they're known for going for the lowest of the lowest tactics.
[03:13:52.155 --> 03:13:54.257]  And when it comes to the children, well, they see that.
[03:13:54.457 --> 03:13:56.840]  You ask anyone, well, if you could have stopped Hitler, would you have?
[03:13:56.860 --> 03:13:58.101]  And it's like, yeah, they would.
[03:13:58.422 --> 03:14:01.926]  So if they see you, the parent, as a Nazi, well, guess what?
[03:14:01.946 --> 03:14:03.307]  That's a little Hitler right next to them.
[03:14:03.427 --> 03:14:05.189]  They've already dehumanized you and your whole family.
[03:14:05.209 --> 03:14:05.590]  So, Paul,
[03:14:07.202 --> 03:14:09.704]  All these countries in Europe, even socialist countries, now they're going bankrupt.
[03:14:09.724 --> 03:14:11.465]  They're turning back the Soros stuff.
[03:14:11.865 --> 03:14:16.288]  I mean, it is falling apart, but how, again, what's their next move?
[03:14:16.989 --> 03:14:18.329]  Because we're tomorrow's news today.
[03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:20.371]  We can't, what does Trump need to do?
[03:14:22.754 --> 03:14:23.114]  I don't know.
[03:14:23.134 --> 03:14:25.257]  I'm not in the business of making predictions.
[03:14:25.297 --> 03:14:26.558]  He needs to see what he's doing already.
[03:14:26.598 --> 03:14:28.560]  I mean, he's just had another major victory today.
[03:14:29.101 --> 03:14:29.841]  And we're winning.
[03:14:29.881 --> 03:14:30.862]  We're winning in Italy.
[03:14:30.902 --> 03:14:34.366]  We're winning the votes because people are seeing that they're completely unhinged.
[03:14:34.466 --> 03:14:37.990]  And that doesn't resonate with calm, reasonable, rational people.
[03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:39.411]  It's not a vote winning strategy.
[03:14:39.711 --> 03:14:41.653]  They've got no candidate for 2020.
[03:14:41.914 --> 03:14:44.877]  They've got no platform apart from this social justice BS.
[03:14:45.297 --> 03:14:47.778]  Which if you look at the polls, everybody's turned off to.
[03:14:48.178 --> 03:14:49.079]  They've got nothing.
[03:14:49.139 --> 03:14:50.439]  So they're just going to lash out.
[03:14:50.459 --> 03:14:53.961]  They're going to try to incite violence inside stuff that we've already seen.
[03:14:54.001 --> 03:14:55.482]  Why don't they run Maxine Waters?
[03:14:55.542 --> 03:14:56.562]  Then we draft her.
[03:14:57.022 --> 03:14:58.303]  Then we draft Maxine Waters.
[03:14:59.636 --> 03:15:05.779]  The other thing, Alex, you were talking about Cernovich and Bill Maher wanting him to put his head in an oven and commit suicide.
[03:15:06.179 --> 03:15:07.660]  Oh, but he doesn't support suicide.
[03:15:08.020 --> 03:15:17.525]  We had an article in October 2012 where he openly said that he wanted people to kill themselves to make way for room on the highway because the planet was overpopulated.
[03:15:17.905 --> 03:15:20.827]  He said, I'm consistently pro-death.
[03:15:21.267 --> 03:15:22.987]  He said, let's kill the right people.
[03:15:23.267 --> 03:15:24.688]  He said, I'm for assisted suicide.
[03:15:24.708 --> 03:15:25.808]  I'm for regular suicide.
[03:15:26.088 --> 03:15:27.668]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[03:15:28.108 --> 03:15:30.989]  So six years ago, he said he was for suicide.
[03:15:31.549 --> 03:15:31.789]  Again.
[03:15:31.809 --> 03:15:34.190]  And then he's saying he denies it today with Cernovich.
[03:15:34.310 --> 03:15:39.511]  Well, then I think he ought to shove a gun in his mouth and blow his little ugly brains all over the wall.
[03:15:40.451 --> 03:15:42.271]  He hates... I mean, seriously.
[03:15:42.291 --> 03:15:43.712]  I mean, you want us all to die?
[03:15:43.732 --> 03:15:44.832]  How about you die?
[03:15:45.272 --> 03:15:47.272]  Quote Emperor Palpatine.
[03:15:47.413 --> 03:15:49.553]  No, no, no, you will die.
[03:15:50.658 --> 03:15:51.538]  Paul, can you do it better than me?
[03:15:51.558 --> 03:15:52.279]  Give me a Palpatine.
[03:15:53.619 --> 03:15:54.959]  Now you will die!
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:15:57.360]  Amazing, Lucas.
[03:15:57.380 --> 03:15:57.860]  You're awesome.
[03:15:58.100 --> 03:15:59.061]  You're coming up on the War Room.
[03:15:59.101 --> 03:15:59.561]  God bless you.
[03:15:59.581 --> 03:16:00.061]  Paul's coming up.
[03:16:00.921 --> 03:16:02.822]  Remember the old days of the internet?
[03:16:03.822 --> 03:16:07.003]  When we communicated with each other directly email to email?
[03:16:08.385 --> 03:16:09.226]  You've got mail.
[03:16:09.807 --> 03:16:12.449]  But then Google came along and said, we've got Gmail.
[03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:13.350]  Why, it's free.
[03:16:13.431 --> 03:16:15.753]  But, of course, we read what you say and what you do.
[03:16:16.554 --> 03:16:22.420]  And then now, more and more, these big globalist companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, if they don't like you, they simply ban you.
[03:16:23.221 --> 03:16:27.566]  And, of course, if you're a conservative, they just list you as a Nazi.
[03:16:27.826 --> 03:16:30.068]  That's right, the entire Republican Party of California.
[03:16:30.889 --> 03:16:35.933]  Ladies and gentlemen, these platforms were useful for us to reach each other while they were still somewhat open and free.
[03:16:36.614 --> 03:16:40.116]  But the big monopoly companies only did this to consolidate the market.
[03:16:40.577 --> 03:16:45.681]  Now they're using that monopoly power, like all monopolies do, to abuse the general public.
[03:16:46.241 --> 03:16:54.604]  That's why it's more important than ever that you visit newswars.com and infowars.com themselves so the globalists can't censor you as easily.
[03:16:54.764 --> 03:16:56.304]  But just as important is email.
[03:16:56.684 --> 03:16:58.345]  We need to be able to talk to you directly.
[03:16:58.705 --> 03:17:04.507]  That's why it's critical that you go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for a free newsletter.
[03:17:05.007 --> 03:17:11.089]  Also, under every article at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, you can see the little sign-up box.
[03:17:11.369 --> 03:17:12.229]  It's absolutely free.
[03:17:12.669 --> 03:17:19.932]  And that way, no matter what happens, we can send you articles, videos, special coupon codes for the shopping cart, you name it.
[03:17:20.452 --> 03:17:27.954]  It is now absolutely essential, according to all the Internet experts I talk to, that everybody start going back more and more.
[03:17:28.334 --> 03:17:28.574]  Yeah.
[03:17:52.962 --> 03:17:54.544]  Shortwave is our emergency backup.
[03:17:55.225 --> 03:17:58.909]  We have to have the emergency backup on the internet, and that is email.
[03:17:59.370 --> 03:18:08.441]  In fact, one idea I've had is, if you don't want to have any spam, you can create a new email that you only share with InfoWars, so I can communicate directly with you.
[03:18:08.921 --> 03:18:21.730]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to sign up for the free newsletter, or you can simply go to the bottom of each page, each article on InfoWars.com, and there's a sign-up box right there.
[03:18:22.091 --> 03:18:29.776]  Look, I was always trying to go for the latest and greatest for the last 20 years on the web, and never really pushed to get listeners to join our email list.
[03:18:29.936 --> 03:18:35.560]  But in the last few years, I've realized how critical it is, and it's an area where InfoWars, quite frankly, is behind.
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:36.421]  Think about this.
[03:18:37.585 --> 03:18:39.846]  We're all pulling for the same mission.
[03:18:40.006 --> 03:18:40.726]  Americana.
[03:18:41.386 --> 03:18:42.246]  Lower taxes.
[03:18:42.526 --> 03:18:43.326]  Second Amendment.
[03:18:43.546 --> 03:18:44.387]  Religious freedom.
[03:18:44.967 --> 03:18:45.887]  Family values.
[03:18:45.907 --> 03:18:46.827]  And it's happening.
[03:18:47.167 --> 03:18:50.168]  But we aren't able to communicate with each other person to person.
[03:18:50.668 --> 03:18:51.268]  Peer to peer.
[03:18:51.988 --> 03:18:55.449]  On these platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, all of it.
[03:18:55.469 --> 03:18:57.209]  More and more that's being censored.
[03:18:57.249 --> 03:18:59.270]  The shadow bands have gone to outright bands.
[03:19:00.399 --> 03:19:02.721]  And yes, we're going to try to reform these institutions.
[03:19:02.741 --> 03:19:03.722]  We're going to try to break them up.
[03:19:03.922 --> 03:19:06.825]  That's the whole process starting with congressional hearings in Congress right now.
[03:19:07.165 --> 03:19:21.017]  But during this long, hard battle, it's more important than ever that patrons, Christians, nationalists, people that are populist, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, be able to communicate with each other and realize the importance of email.
[03:19:21.938 --> 03:19:26.899]  I personally get sick of email and how it gets full of spam, especially with my older email addresses.
[03:19:27.419 --> 03:19:32.921]  That's why, with Friends and Family, I have private email that only Friends and Family have.
[03:19:33.941 --> 03:19:44.463]  I again suggest that everybody go to mfulwards.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can send you direct videos, direct articles, and bypass the system.
[03:19:44.563 --> 03:19:51.105]  And yes, send you special coupon codes and other deals that are the very best we offer from mfulwardsstore.com.
[03:19:51.685 --> 03:19:54.207]  Again, my friends, thank you for joining us in the InfoWar.
[03:19:54.227 --> 03:19:55.488]  We're winning thanks to you.
[03:19:55.548 --> 03:19:55.988]  God bless.
[03:19:56.028 --> 03:19:58.610]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.091 --> 03:20:20.893]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.093 --> 03:20:24.814]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:24.894 --> 03:20:28.316]  We are live.
[03:20:28.456 --> 03:20:30.976]  It is the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.156 --> 03:20:35.738]  In the next segment, we're going to play a clip from Stephen Crowder's YouTube channel.
[03:20:36.340 --> 03:20:37.901]  Basically, he went out to an event.
[03:20:37.941 --> 03:20:41.464]  He had one of these, um, you know, change my mind events.
[03:20:41.825 --> 03:20:52.193]  One of the leftists there doxxed them, tweeted out their location, and then encouraged other people to firebomb their van because they're so tolerant, peaceful, and loving.
[03:20:52.813 --> 03:21:05.804]  So then they found this woman at the, uh, the same event, I think, or she had a booth at the same event that Crowder was at, confronted her, confronted the mob that surrounded her to try and get one of them, one of them to disavow the violence,
[03:21:06.508 --> 03:21:16.434]  Not only did they fail to get them to disavow it, they basically huddled round them in a huge mob, tried to intimidate them, called them Nazis of course, and completely justified it.
[03:21:16.894 --> 03:21:19.836]  Again, this is just the start of this violent rhetoric.
[03:21:19.876 --> 03:21:24.979]  You get these doxing incidents, you get that many people irate, incited.
[03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:31.832]  And it could end in bloodshed, as it already did with the James T. Hodgkinson shooting just over a year ago, of course.
[03:21:32.432 --> 03:21:41.335]  A minor miracle that nobody died, an attempted massacre of Republicans by a far-left extremist, radicalized by mainstream media propaganda.
[03:21:42.835 --> 03:21:51.998]  Talking of mainstream media propaganda, there was a New York Times piece today that trended on Twitter this morning entitled, We Have a Crisis of Democracy, Not Manners.
[03:21:52.717 --> 03:22:14.785]  Well no, you have a crisis of butthurt because you still refuse to accept the results of democratic election, and you're getting more desperate because you see that Trump's likely to win in 2020, the Republicans now have a great chance of holding onto the House in 2018, you've blown your 16 point lead, the blue wave has turned into a drizzle, and now you're freaking out about it.
[03:22:14.825 --> 03:22:17.866]  So they had this article, New York Times trending article,
[03:22:19.173 --> 03:22:29.805]  And down below, right near the bottom of it, it said this, quote, she's trying to justify the whole Maxine Waters thing, basically agreeing that people should be confronted in an intimidating way.
[03:22:29.845 --> 03:22:39.436]  She said this, the writer, I know of no left-wing publication that has run quasi-pornographic fantasies about murdering political enemies.
[03:22:40.056 --> 03:22:40.457]  Really?
[03:22:41.511 --> 03:22:41.951]  Really?
[03:22:42.111 --> 03:22:47.054]  There was literally one just yesterday and we wrote about it up on Infowars.com.
[03:22:47.415 --> 03:22:47.955]  Headline!
[03:22:48.415 --> 03:22:53.318]  Left-wing writer suggests anti-Trump protesters should carry out domestic terror attacks.
[03:22:54.759 --> 03:22:56.220]  Now they got a picture of this guy.
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:22:57.981]  He looked like he was completely out to lunch.
[03:22:58.041 --> 03:22:59.562]  He was wearing a Batman mask.
[03:22:59.982 --> 03:23:03.144]  Looked like some kind of ginger ISIS jihadist.
[03:23:04.164 --> 03:23:06.166]  Because I'm sure he's tolerant and peaceful and loving.
[03:23:06.986 --> 03:23:08.167]  A far-left columnist
[03:23:08.797 --> 03:23:17.100]  Now this was a website called Splinter News, owned by Univision, a division of Gizmodo Media Group.
[03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:18.980]  So they bought out Gizmodo Media Group.
[03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:22.361]  This Splinter News was one of those websites formerly owned by Gizmodo.
[03:23:22.681 --> 03:23:25.102]  It's now owned by Univision Communications.
[03:23:25.602 --> 03:23:30.864]  So it's a massive corporation owning this fairly sizable left-wing media website.
[03:23:31.624 --> 03:23:34.325]  And in an article entitled, This is Just the Beginning,
[03:23:34.833 --> 03:23:40.055]  The writer Hamilton Nolan writes, this is all going to get more extreme and it should.
[03:23:40.976 --> 03:23:41.816]  Let me say that again.
[03:23:41.836 --> 03:23:42.617]  This is what he wrote.
[03:23:42.897 --> 03:23:46.378]  This is all going to get more extreme and it should.
[03:23:46.658 --> 03:23:49.780]  That's an open call for extremism.
[03:23:50.580 --> 03:23:56.483]  He went on to say that Trump administration officials should not be able to quote, live their lives in peace.
[03:23:58.283 --> 03:23:59.324]  And what did he mean by that?
[03:23:59.344 --> 03:24:02.106]  Well, he went on to say, read an effing history book.
[03:24:02.526 --> 03:24:03.647]  Read a recent history book.
[03:24:03.687 --> 03:24:09.931]  The US had thousands of domestic bombings per year in the early 1970s.
[03:24:09.991 --> 03:24:20.799]  Of course, he's talking about the Weathermen Underground domestic terror attacks carried out by far-left terrorist organisations, including Black Panther organisations as well.
[03:24:21.399 --> 03:24:25.142]  So he's talking about making the lives of Trump administration officials uncomfortable.
[03:24:25.822 --> 03:24:28.344]  He's saying that things are going to get more extreme than they should.
[03:24:28.865 --> 03:24:31.827]  And then he talks about domestic bombings in the United States.
[03:24:32.167 --> 03:24:34.910]  Gee, I wonder what the connection is there.
[03:24:35.410 --> 03:24:36.791]  Can we put two and two together?
[03:24:37.232 --> 03:24:38.533]  He went on to say this quote.
[03:24:39.514 --> 03:24:49.402]  The day will come sooner than you all think when Trump administration officials will look back fondly on the time when all they had to worry about was getting hollered out at a Mexican restaurant.
[03:24:50.444 --> 03:24:56.307]  He went on to say, when you aggressively F with people's lives, you should not be surprised when they decide to F with yours.
[03:24:56.747 --> 03:25:07.592]  So he's clearly putting it in the context of justifying, encouraging, some would say even inciting, domestic terror attacks against either Trump supporters or Trump administration officials.
[03:25:08.832 --> 03:25:12.334]  He justified it by claiming that Trump administration was implementing fascism.
[03:25:12.394 --> 03:25:19.137]  Again, going back to this idea of delegitimising, dehumanising people for attack, for violent assault, by calling them Nazis.
[03:25:21.115 --> 03:25:28.129]  He went on to say the people who are responsible for what is happening are not going to get out of this with their happy, wealthy, respectable lives unscathed.
[03:25:28.770 --> 03:25:33.139]  And the ones who make the laws are not going to like what happens when America starts to regard them as the criminals.
[03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:41.747]  Openly inciting potential attacks against Trump administration officials or Trump supporters.
[03:25:42.167 --> 03:25:45.611]  The context of that article cannot be taken any other way.
[03:25:46.031 --> 03:25:53.358]  He hasn't come out, as far as I looked on his Twitter an hour ago, and disavowed it or walked it back or said he's not calling for violence.
[03:25:53.758 --> 03:25:54.759]  The article stands.
[03:25:55.159 --> 03:25:58.281]  It's up on a major left-wing website owned by Univision.
[03:25:58.602 --> 03:26:09.289]  So when the New York Times says, oh, there's no left-wing publication that's ever endorsed violence against political enemies, literally it happened last night, yesterday.
[03:26:10.290 --> 03:26:11.971]  And there are numerous other examples of it.
[03:26:12.011 --> 03:26:13.472]  But the article's still up there.
[03:26:13.933 --> 03:26:15.214]  And this is the tone.
[03:26:15.294 --> 03:26:16.134]  This is the rhetoric.
[03:26:16.194 --> 03:26:17.555]  These are the times that we're living in.
[03:26:18.056 --> 03:26:19.437]  Absolute insanity.
[03:26:19.957 --> 03:26:20.958]  We have a professor
[03:26:22.140 --> 03:26:38.368]  University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Harlan Reynolds, who wrote an article in the USA Today, saying what Alex Jones said on Sunday, that we're already in a civil war, albeit low-level, but he said in an op-ed for USA Today that America is headed towards a civil war.
[03:26:38.388 --> 03:26:42.009]  He asked the question in the headline, and then he says it's already begun.
[03:26:42.370 --> 03:26:43.190]  Those are his words.
[03:26:44.090 --> 03:26:49.433]  Quote, Hollywood has basically turned its products and its award shows into showcases for the resistance.
[03:26:50.146 --> 03:26:53.649]  Americans are already sorting themselves into communities that are predominantly red or blue.
[03:26:54.790 --> 03:27:02.015]  So he said that the Sarah Huckabee Sanders incident, which again, you've probably seen this by now, she wasn't just harassed in the restaurant.
[03:27:02.575 --> 03:27:05.878]  After she was harassed initially, she left with her husband, they went home.
[03:27:05.898 --> 03:27:11.222]  Then her family went to a different restaurant and they were harassed too.
[03:27:12.085 --> 03:27:18.189]  So they're directly targeting people's families, even if the target of their anger is no longer present.
[03:27:18.529 --> 03:27:20.390]  Which goes back to what Peter Fonda said.
[03:27:20.811 --> 03:27:25.193]  Oh by the way, Peter Fonda, what is it now, nearly a week since he said this on Twitter?
[03:27:25.694 --> 03:27:28.596]  Advocating hacking a government database, a crime.
[03:27:29.376 --> 03:27:35.820]  Advocating targeting and intimidating the children of Border Patrol agents at their schools.
[03:27:36.281 --> 03:27:41.464]  Advocating putting Barron Trump in a cage and making him get raped by paedophiles.
[03:27:42.321 --> 03:27:45.163]  Do you think any of those violate Twitter's terms of service?
[03:27:45.223 --> 03:27:47.504]  Yes, all three do, clearly.
[03:27:47.984 --> 03:27:48.985]  Is he banned on Twitter?
[03:27:49.165 --> 03:27:49.345]  No.
[03:27:49.465 --> 03:27:51.626]  He wasn't even suspended for 24 hours.
[03:27:51.846 --> 03:27:53.507]  He deleted the tweets he was back on.
[03:27:54.508 --> 03:27:57.869]  You know, Milo got banned for making fun of a Ghostbusters movie.
[03:27:58.089 --> 03:27:58.950]  Lifetime ban.
[03:27:59.350 --> 03:28:06.474]  Oh, but if you want to put a kid in a cage to be raped by paedophiles, intimidate people's children, hack a government database, no problem!
[03:28:06.694 --> 03:28:07.554]  You don't even get a 24-hour ban!
[03:28:10.376 --> 03:28:17.357]  But again, going back to this article, this professor says that civil war has already begun because he said that civil society is being eroded.
[03:28:18.010 --> 03:28:27.840]  Polarisation can partly be blamed on the disintegration of churches, organisations and neighbourhoods, which previously helped people build social ties that transcended politics.
[03:28:28.321 --> 03:28:41.194]  So again, he's talking about the atomisation of society, the fact that nobody talks to their neighbours anymore, the fact that fewer and fewer people participate in civil society or go to church, so they don't meet people, they don't have conversations, even if they disagree politically.
[03:28:41.900 --> 03:28:48.206]  To kind of resonate and bond as human beings, as Americans who all live in the same country and should want the best for everyone.
[03:28:48.507 --> 03:28:50.749]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, fourth hour.
[03:28:50.889 --> 03:28:52.330]  We'll be back in fourwars.com.
[03:29:00.591 --> 03:29:03.252]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:29:03.652 --> 03:29:08.793]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[03:29:09.473 --> 03:29:12.394]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[03:29:12.834 --> 03:29:16.354]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[03:29:16.975 --> 03:29:28.217]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[03:29:28.877 --> 03:29:39.626]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[03:29:39.926 --> 03:29:45.370]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.

[03:29:51.315 --> 03:29:54.438]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle,

[03:29:58.681 --> 03:30:00.303]  We need your support.
[03:30:01.183 --> 03:30:04.846]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.
[03:30:06.968 --> 03:30:22.021]  We are launching our biggest recruitment and hiring operation ever in our 23-year history as we prepare to go 24 hours a day live on TV and radio from the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas.

[03:30:34.608 --> 03:30:43.874]  We're looking to hire around 15 people, maybe even more, as we take the information war to the next level in the face of the globalists.
[03:30:44.294 --> 03:30:44.775]  So please,

[03:30:54.482 --> 03:31:03.230]  And we're also launching, as I just alluded to, a major reporter contest with $26,000 in prizes.
[03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:04.251]  First place, $20,000.
[03:31:05.031 --> 03:31:05.612]  Second place, $5,000.
[03:31:05.932 --> 03:31:07.393]  Third place, $1,000.

[03:31:24.703 --> 03:31:34.328]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.
[03:31:34.648 --> 03:31:52.153]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.

[03:31:57.415 --> 03:32:02.559]  But it's critical that as fast as you can, you get your portfolio, your reel, into us.
[03:32:02.619 --> 03:32:05.682]  Whether it be in radio, whether it be in print, whether it be in film.

[03:32:31.113 --> 03:32:32.353]  We are not victims.
[03:32:32.533 --> 03:32:33.754]  We are victorious.
[03:32:34.114 --> 03:32:39.075]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[03:32:39.155 --> 03:32:43.816]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.
[03:32:44.316 --> 03:32:53.239]  Again, InfoWars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules, and I'll see you on the front lines of the fight against the NWO.
[03:33:04.164 --> 03:33:06.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.047 --> 03:33:18.271]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.

[03:33:24.643 --> 03:33:28.370]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:30.785 --> 03:33:39.508]  We're going to get to that Steven Crowder clip here in a couple of minutes, where basically they confront one of the would-be leftist jihadists, and it ends up in a complete farce.
[03:33:39.528 --> 03:33:41.009]  We're going to go to that here in a couple of minutes.

[03:35:28.126 --> 03:35:30.007]  We need it more than ever.
[03:35:30.982 --> 03:35:32.923]  Let's go to this Stephen Crowder clip now.
[03:35:33.343 --> 03:35:52.068]  He had one of his events, which is, you know, the famous Change My Mind events, when he was doxxed and basically threatened by a leftist who encouraged people to go and firebomb his van with him in it, and then they found this woman, this tolerant leftist, at another event later on down the line, and they confronted her.
[03:35:52.228 --> 03:35:53.409]  Let's see what happened.
[03:35:53.489 --> 03:35:53.889]  Here it is.
[03:35:56.099 --> 03:36:04.504]  So we were at the Texas State Democrat Convention taping a 4th of July theme to Change My Mind to be released on July 2nd, when we noticed a familiar face.
[03:36:05.004 --> 03:36:06.085]  It's Firebomb Lady!
[03:36:06.485 --> 03:36:11.728]  That's the girl who posted our location in Austin precisely and called for people to firebomb our car!
[03:36:11.888 --> 03:36:16.030]  And then doubled down with a second post for additional domestic terrorism context.
[03:36:16.290 --> 03:36:17.691]  So I decided to confront her.
[03:36:17.711 --> 03:36:19.332]  Hey kids.
[03:36:23.214 --> 03:36:25.215]  How are you today?
[03:36:27.517 --> 03:36:28.158]  I have a question for you.
[03:36:28.699 --> 03:36:30.682]  Why would you encourage people to firebomb my van?
[03:36:32.625 --> 03:36:33.246]  Why would you do that?
[03:36:33.266 --> 03:36:40.417]  Do you think that's appropriate to encourage people to firebomb my van and hurt my crew when we're just expressing a difference of opinion?
[03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:42.510]  Sorry, could you repeat that?
[03:36:42.791 --> 03:36:45.292]  Why would you threaten to firebomb my van or encourage other people to do it?
[03:36:45.752 --> 03:36:47.513]  At first, she just denied, denied, denied.
[03:36:48.634 --> 03:36:50.355]  Good thing we brought a Bristol board!
[03:36:50.735 --> 03:36:55.438]  As a matter of fact, we have your pictures right here of your tweets of you posting our location, right?
[03:36:55.458 --> 03:36:56.458]  Let's hold that for me there.
[03:36:56.478 --> 03:36:57.399]  Nah, I'm kidding.
[03:36:57.839 --> 03:36:59.500]  So, is that the way you deal with civil disagreements?
[03:37:00.401 --> 03:37:00.981]  This is really good.
[03:37:01.636 --> 03:37:05.377]  I've heard a lot of people talk about calls to civility with President Trump and conservatives, but what about this?
[03:37:05.397 --> 03:37:06.777]  What about firebombing someone?
[03:37:07.217 --> 03:37:08.278]  Committing acts of violence?
[03:37:08.538 --> 03:37:10.278]  I would never encourage acts of violence against you.
[03:37:10.298 --> 03:37:11.818]  I don't want anyone to ever hurt you.
[03:37:13.039 --> 03:37:13.559]  Nothing, huh?
[03:37:13.779 --> 03:37:14.739]  This is the tolerant left?
[03:37:16.999 --> 03:37:18.020]  No, my feelings aren't hurt.
[03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:19.180]  I just don't want to be firebombed.
[03:37:19.320 --> 03:37:23.621]  It doesn't really have a place in today's political discussion, wouldn't you say?
[03:37:24.081 --> 03:37:24.641]  Why the eye roll?
[03:37:25.001 --> 03:37:26.182]  You think it does play a role?
[03:37:27.122 --> 03:37:28.062]  As long as it's the right target?
[03:37:29.227 --> 03:37:29.547]  Really?
[03:37:30.048 --> 03:37:30.868]  No opinion on this at all?
[03:37:30.908 --> 03:37:34.290]  What if a conservative, what if Donald Trump were to encourage anyone to firebomb somebody else?
[03:37:34.490 --> 03:37:36.792]  Well, when they go to war, that's what they're doing.
[03:37:36.812 --> 03:37:40.094]  We're not in war, we're just having a discussion, as we just did with three or four Democrats.
[03:37:40.214 --> 03:37:40.734]  At a van?
[03:37:40.814 --> 03:37:44.296]  Literally said we need to kill innocent families.
[03:37:44.336 --> 03:37:44.877]  Did he say that?
[03:37:45.117 --> 03:37:45.777]  When did he say that?
[03:37:46.057 --> 03:37:47.578]  But I didn't say that.
[03:37:47.738 --> 03:37:48.699]  But I've never said that.
[03:37:48.719 --> 03:37:49.319]  What if Trump said this?
[03:37:49.339 --> 03:37:50.440]  Do you condemn that?
[03:37:52.956 --> 03:37:53.636]  No, I think it's great.
[03:37:53.716 --> 03:37:54.537]  You think it's great?
[03:37:54.617 --> 03:37:57.858]  So you're cool with firebombing people who've never committed an act of violence?
[03:37:57.918 --> 03:38:00.858]  This drone strikes on children.
[03:38:00.898 --> 03:38:01.979]  So this doesn't bother you?
[03:38:02.179 --> 03:38:04.480]  You're okay with encouraging violence against people?
[03:38:04.580 --> 03:38:05.720]  I just want to make sure.
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:06.120]  What?
[03:38:06.160 --> 03:38:07.701]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:07.781 --> 03:38:08.941]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:09.181 --> 03:38:11.262]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:11.442 --> 03:38:13.102]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:13.162 --> 03:38:14.303]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:14.343 --> 03:38:15.703]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:15.743 --> 03:38:16.663]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:16.743 --> 03:38:18.204]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:18.344 --> 03:38:20.264]  A van is not a life!
[03:38:20.604 --> 03:38:22.305]  What about the people in the van, though?
[03:38:22.785 --> 03:38:24.286]  A man is out of line!
[03:38:24.406 --> 03:38:25.888]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:25.928 --> 03:38:26.968]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:27.008 --> 03:38:29.210]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:29.250 --> 03:38:31.172]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:31.432 --> 03:38:33.373]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:33.674 --> 03:38:35.655]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:35.735 --> 03:38:37.837]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:38.077 --> 03:38:39.959]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:40.019 --> 03:38:41.360]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:41.420 --> 03:38:42.901]  Healthcare is a human right!
[03:38:43.321 --> 03:38:43.862]  I can do this.
[03:38:43.882 --> 03:38:45.684]  I can do it all day.
[03:38:45.865 --> 03:38:49.829]  You're disrespecting my flag by wearing it on your body.
[03:38:49.869 --> 03:38:50.150]  Really?
[03:38:50.170 --> 03:38:52.813]  What bothers me is encouraging acts of violence and acting like an animal.
[03:38:52.833 --> 03:38:55.516]  You're the one who started the chant!
[03:38:58.900 --> 03:39:04.101]  You started the chant!
[03:39:04.261 --> 03:39:05.562]  What's the solution?
[03:39:05.582 --> 03:39:07.842]  Non-violent speech!
[03:39:08.462 --> 03:39:09.283]  You animals!
[03:39:09.383 --> 03:39:11.083]  I'm just looking for one condemnation.
[03:39:11.403 --> 03:39:13.484]  Anyone to have an opinion on encouraging acts of violence.
[03:39:13.624 --> 03:39:14.864]  I discourage them across the board.
[03:39:14.884 --> 03:39:18.885]  You're putting acts of violence against her by posting her face everywhere and trying to get people to hurt her.
[03:39:19.345 --> 03:39:20.685]  I've never done that!
[03:39:21.425 --> 03:39:24.546]  This is her asking people to bomb my van!
[03:39:24.566 --> 03:39:26.007]  No she didn't!
[03:39:26.047 --> 03:39:27.127]  You put her on Twitter?
[03:39:28.007 --> 03:39:30.268]  Van, fire, take care of it!
[03:39:30.308 --> 03:39:34.051]  This was clearly an exercise in futility, so they brought out the heavy artillery.
[03:39:34.071 --> 03:39:35.451]  Stand up, fight back!
[03:39:35.612 --> 03:39:36.472]  Good, good.
[03:39:36.492 --> 03:39:38.333]  You're a very violent and angry little fella.
[03:39:38.493 --> 03:39:39.694]  Stand up, fight back!
[03:39:39.794 --> 03:39:40.154]  Thank you.
[03:39:40.174 --> 03:39:43.356]  I see you're strong with the mob, but you should be ashamed of yourself.
[03:39:43.516 --> 03:39:45.597]  Stand up, fight back!
[03:39:45.637 --> 03:39:46.678]  You missed the cue.
[03:39:51.113 --> 03:39:58.866]  Do you believe that all people, regardless of their race, should have equal opportunities in this country?
[03:40:00.310 --> 03:40:00.991]  Nothing to say.
[03:40:01.391 --> 03:40:04.455]  Just an apology would be nice.
[03:40:04.495 --> 03:40:05.936]  You are a coward, though.
[03:40:06.097 --> 03:40:08.339]  You're a coward, too.
[03:40:08.379 --> 03:40:09.120]  Thank you.
[03:40:09.180 --> 03:40:10.081]  You're a coward.
[03:40:10.201 --> 03:40:12.704]  I have no problem saying you're all cowards.
[03:40:12.724 --> 03:40:13.345]  She's a coward.
[03:40:13.465 --> 03:40:14.586]  She's a coward.
[03:40:14.626 --> 03:40:16.088]  We can see how big of a man you are.
[03:40:16.128 --> 03:40:17.950]  Wanna go to the restroom?
[03:40:18.210 --> 03:40:19.632]  Come on, man.
[03:40:19.652 --> 03:40:20.573]  Let's stop being cowards.
[03:40:21.213 --> 03:40:24.195]  And then, of course, they called the brutal, fascist, racist police.
[03:40:24.775 --> 03:40:26.276]  Uh, who agreed with us that they were dicks.
[03:40:26.536 --> 03:40:31.239]  Well, look, see, this lady encouraged acts of violence against me, and so I just was asking her why, and she was shutting me down.
[03:40:31.559 --> 03:40:33.941]  Look, is that not... That seems pretty reprehensible, right?
[03:40:33.961 --> 03:40:37.223]  To post my location in our van in a bomb, saying, take care of it.
[03:40:37.243 --> 03:40:37.963]  That's pretty bad, isn't it?
[03:40:38.063 --> 03:40:38.463]  Yeah.
[03:40:38.543 --> 03:40:39.084]  Okay.
[03:40:39.104 --> 03:40:39.444]  See that?
[03:40:39.524 --> 03:40:42.286]  Anyone who's not with you thinks that's bad.
[03:40:42.346 --> 03:40:42.766]  Hey, officer.
[03:40:43.066 --> 03:40:46.588]  I was just confronting a lady who encouraged firebombing against my car and asked her why she did it.
[03:40:46.608 --> 03:40:47.008]  Don't worry about it.
[03:40:47.148 --> 03:40:49.269]  But they had to ask us to leave anyway, which we did.
[03:40:49.509 --> 03:40:52.850]  Unfortunately, there still seemed to be some miscommunications.
[03:40:53.110 --> 03:40:54.271]  Nazi, go home!
[03:40:54.611 --> 03:40:55.992]  Nazi, go home!
[03:40:56.192 --> 03:41:00.854]  It seems they're less offended by the Nazism than by the fact that we had a better booth than them.
[03:41:01.494 --> 03:41:06.615]  So there you have it, Steven Crowder confronting somebody who threatened to firebomb, or at least encouraged others to firebomb his van.
[03:41:06.635 --> 03:41:06.996]  And again,
[03:41:28.329 --> 03:41:34.935]  The whole narrative in the leftist media today is, oh, the Tea Party stood up and confronted Democrats during the Obama era.
[03:41:34.995 --> 03:41:37.097]  Yes, and they did, and it was very confrontational.
[03:41:37.117 --> 03:41:37.837]  It was aggressive.
[03:41:38.137 --> 03:41:46.905]  But if you want to talk about legitimizing violence, you want to talk about a situation where, you know, the New York Times is openly siding with this.
[03:41:47.005 --> 03:41:51.088]  We had the whole punch a Nazi narrative for the past year plus.
[03:41:51.409 --> 03:41:52.209]  Who's a Nazi?
[03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:54.011]  Anyone who disagrees with you.
[03:41:54.411 --> 03:41:56.333]  See how the slippery slope goes here.
[03:41:56.813 --> 03:41:59.534]  We've got people openly now calling Trump a Nazi.
[03:41:59.995 --> 03:42:02.056]  You know, shock horror, get a new insult.
[03:42:02.096 --> 03:42:06.278]  Again, the lack of originality is tiresome to say the least.
[03:42:07.018 --> 03:42:12.781]  But again, if you dehumanize somebody, if you dehumanize tens of millions of American voters as Nazis,
[03:42:13.396 --> 03:42:17.420]  That's different from a few toothless hicks spewing death threats against Obama on Twitter back in 2010.
[03:42:29.172 --> 03:42:40.916]  A little bit different when it's being codified and legitimized by the mainstream media, when this hysteria is being whipped up every single day by people on television with huge audiences still.
[03:42:40.956 --> 03:42:41.996]  That's the difference.
[03:42:42.356 --> 03:42:43.657]  They've legitimized it.
[03:42:43.917 --> 03:42:55.941]  They've moved the Ovalton window so far left, they've become so hysterical that it's now directly leading to attacks on Trump supporters, as it has for the past year, and events like James T. Hodgkinson attempting to massacre people.
[03:42:56.001 --> 03:42:58.262]  This is the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[03:42:58.302 --> 03:42:58.722]  We'll be back.
[03:43:00.345 --> 03:43:04.707]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:05.207 --> 03:43:14.112]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[03:43:14.652 --> 03:43:19.235]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion formula.

[03:44:04.625 --> 03:44:07.726]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:44:07.746 --> 03:44:08.287]  You're on the air.
[03:44:08.307 --> 03:44:08.827]  Thanks for holding.
[03:44:09.227 --> 03:44:10.308]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:44:10.528 --> 03:44:11.128]  Hey, brother.
[03:44:11.428 --> 03:44:11.808]  Good, man.
[03:44:11.828 --> 03:44:12.629]  Thank you for calling.
[03:44:12.709 --> 03:44:13.269]  Hey, hey.
[03:44:13.369 --> 03:44:17.771]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:44:17.991 --> 03:44:24.354]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Mipho ZX.
[03:44:24.494 --> 03:44:26.195]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[03:44:26.275 --> 03:44:33.238]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:44:33.598 --> 03:44:34.699]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:44:34.759 --> 03:44:37.200]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[03:44:37.260 --> 03:44:38.781]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:44:39.161 --> 03:44:40.762]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:44:41.222 --> 03:44:41.982]  And exactly.
[03:44:42.002 --> 03:44:46.224]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:44:46.565 --> 03:44:46.845]  Boom!
[03:44:46.985 --> 03:44:49.806]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:44:49.866 --> 03:44:50.406]  It's amazing.
[03:44:50.466 --> 03:44:51.747]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[03:44:51.827 --> 03:44:54.709]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:45:00.228 --> 03:45:07.229]  Every week, we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[03:45:07.629 --> 03:45:14.030]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[03:45:14.671 --> 03:45:20.492]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[03:45:21.572 --> 03:45:28.333]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[03:45:29.315 --> 03:45:30.795]  Television over phone lines.
[03:45:31.075 --> 03:45:33.256]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[03:45:33.736 --> 03:45:39.617]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[03:45:40.578 --> 03:45:44.979]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[03:45:45.579 --> 03:45:49.840]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[03:45:50.380 --> 03:45:51.640]  This is very, very exciting.
[03:45:51.720 --> 03:45:55.321]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[03:45:56.281 --> 03:46:17.477]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to Cable Channel 9 to Phonoscope, not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows and all the other news and anchors and analysis that we're adding.
[03:46:17.938 --> 03:46:20.600]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[03:46:21.340 --> 03:46:25.082]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[03:46:25.102 --> 03:46:27.163]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[03:46:27.604 --> 03:46:43.412]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show, and listeners of my show, to tune into Phonoscope, and to also visit their website, so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[03:46:43.953 --> 03:46:44.313]  So again,
[03:46:44.813 --> 03:46:49.794]  From myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[03:46:50.314 --> 03:46:51.815]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[03:46:52.095 --> 03:46:53.655]  You've helped make America great again.
[03:46:55.115 --> 03:46:59.076]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:03.697 --> 03:47:06.318]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.194 --> 03:47:19.276]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:47:19.356 --> 03:47:21.597]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.877 --> 03:47:25.840]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:28.527 --> 03:47:30.349]  It is the final segment of the fourth hour.
[03:47:30.409 --> 03:47:32.791]  War Room is coming up at the top of the hour.
[03:47:32.811 --> 03:47:36.054]  We're going to go to this Conrad Black video here in a second.
[03:47:36.514 --> 03:47:38.115]  Headline up on Infowars, Conrad Black.
[03:47:38.155 --> 03:47:40.838]  Trump is winning a bloodless civil war against the establishment.
[03:47:40.858 --> 03:47:45.622]  But first I want to read just a small passage from John Nolte's article out of Breitbart today.
[03:47:46.062 --> 03:47:50.366]  Again talking about why we're seeing this heightened hysterical rhetoric from the left.
[03:47:50.806 --> 03:48:00.974]  Because again, as I pointed out, every time a leftist promotes extremism and violence, as Splinter News did yesterday, and then the New York Times lied about it and said, no left-wing website's ever doing this!
[03:48:01.294 --> 03:48:02.715]  Literally, they did it on the same day.
[03:48:03.456 --> 03:48:07.319]  Again, when they do this, it puts another reasonable-minded person off voting for Democrats.
[03:48:07.339 --> 03:48:14.704]  This is not a vote-winning strategy to act crazy, to throw your toys out of the pram every time something doesn't go your way.
[03:48:15.085 --> 03:48:19.268]  Get an actual platform like Trump got, that's how he won the election.
[03:48:20.111 --> 03:48:22.514]  Again, this whole crisis of democracy mantra.
[03:48:22.874 --> 03:48:32.845]  The only crisis is within you, within your mindset and your narrative, because again, your harmful, intolerant ideology is being rejected by everybody.
[03:48:32.885 --> 03:48:34.546]  This is what John Knowlton said about it.
[03:48:34.566 --> 03:48:41.654]  That's the article out of Splinter News yesterday, where literally they talk about Trump administration officials should be glad
[03:48:42.685 --> 03:48:47.766]  That they're only getting hollered outside restaurants and basically saying that it needs to get more extreme.
[03:48:48.026 --> 03:48:50.987]  Then he goes on to talk about domestic bombings.
[03:48:51.067 --> 03:48:53.427]  Gee, what kind of connection is he making there?
[03:48:54.127 --> 03:48:57.668]  But again, this is what John Nolte said about the situation in his article today.
[03:48:58.788 --> 03:49:05.889]  He said, what the left and the media are doing is testing us, testing how far they can go, how much we will take, how ugly they can get.
[03:49:06.369 --> 03:49:09.590]  They're also hoping to normalise this violent behaviour in the eyes of the public.
[03:49:10.552 --> 03:49:14.173]  They want us to get as used to it to see it as the status quo.
[03:49:14.193 --> 03:49:15.693]  So they're trying to normalise this.
[03:49:16.253 --> 03:49:22.894]  Again, if they can normalise it that calling for violence is a legitimate form of political discourse, what's the next stage?
[03:49:22.994 --> 03:49:23.894]  Gee, I wonder.
[03:49:24.635 --> 03:49:27.155]  He goes on to say the left cannot win at the ballot box.
[03:49:27.175 --> 03:49:29.315]  Their media no longer have the power to persuade.
[03:49:29.615 --> 03:49:33.716]  Their elected officials are completely out of ideas, other than socialism.
[03:49:34.096 --> 03:49:36.297]  So now they turn to violence.
[03:49:36.797 --> 03:49:37.837]  And again, that's exactly it.
[03:49:38.829 --> 03:49:41.892]  You talk about violent rhetoric during the Obama era.
[03:49:42.192 --> 03:49:46.976]  I mean, it was there in the background, but it was nowhere near the levels we see now.
[03:49:47.256 --> 03:50:00.467]  And it certainly wasn't being legitimized by centrists, by the mainstream media on the right, if you want to talk about Fox News or whoever, like it is being legitimized by the big media, by the hysterical media on the left right now.
[03:50:01.027 --> 03:50:02.809]  But Conrad Black came out today
[03:50:04.002 --> 03:50:10.206]  In an interview, and I talked about this with Alex earlier, this is a guy who was a former Bilderberg steering committee member.
[03:50:10.286 --> 03:50:11.707]  Again, he was part of the elite.
[03:50:12.067 --> 03:50:13.728]  At least he had one foot in the elite.
[03:50:14.168 --> 03:50:17.930]  Conrad Black, former newspaper magnate, he owned a bunch of papers around the world.
[03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:21.412]  Big former globalist, now apparently changed course.
[03:50:21.912 --> 03:50:28.896]  He said that Donald Trump has launched a bloodless civil war against the establishment and basically makes the point that he's winning.
[03:50:28.916 --> 03:50:29.737]  Here's the clip.
[03:50:32.017 --> 03:50:37.122]  What was needed was a bloodless civil war to clean up the Washington sleaze factory.
[03:50:37.402 --> 03:50:41.526]  The entire government of the United States had become a shambles.
[03:50:41.867 --> 03:50:52.197]  Let me remind you, in the previous 20 years, you had the greatest economic crisis since the 1930s, brought on by bad American policy, both parties, both branches of government.
[03:50:53.817 --> 03:51:10.342]  You had virtually the entire conventional land forces capability of the United States militarily mired in the Middle East for 15 years in order chiefly to hand over the main influence over Iraq to Iran, which is the last thing they wanted.
[03:51:10.762 --> 03:51:20.632]  He produced this humanitarian crisis where millions of desperate people were scrambling for their lives and turning up on the shores of Italy and into Central Europe and so forth.
[03:51:21.653 --> 03:51:25.858]  All caused by utter incompetence in American policymaking.
[03:51:27.731 --> 03:51:41.936]  The decline of GDP per capita growth in the United States from 4.5% under Reagan, 3.9% under Clinton, 2% under George W. Bush, 1% under Obama, the country was a pressure cooker.
[03:51:42.216 --> 03:51:48.999]  Poverty went up, violence rose, discontent rose, but our great national media in the United States didn't notice that.
[03:51:49.420 --> 03:51:51.482]  And Trump said it is all rotten.
[03:51:51.502 --> 03:51:52.644]  We've got to clean it all up.
[03:51:52.884 --> 03:52:00.313]  Wall Street, Hollywood, the national media, the lobbyists, campaign financing, all factions of both parties.
[03:52:00.333 --> 03:52:01.314]  They're all useless.
[03:52:01.334 --> 03:52:02.256]  We've got to get rid of them.
[03:52:02.596 --> 03:52:03.257]  And he's doing it.
[03:52:03.337 --> 03:52:03.878]  And it's a war.
[03:52:05.271 --> 03:52:13.537]  It's a war, and it's a war that he's winning right now, and that's why you see the desperation, the flailing hysteria from the left and this alarming uptick in violent rhetoric.
[03:52:13.757 --> 03:52:28.407]  That's Conrad Black, a former Bilderberg member, former Bilderberg steering committee member, laying it down the line and actually coming over to the like side and pointing out that Trump is at war with the deep state, with the establishment, and that he's winning.
[03:52:28.787 --> 03:52:34.771]  And so the resistance, as they call it, which is now openly inciting harassment, intimidation and violent attacks,
[03:52:35.211 --> 03:52:36.711]  They're on the side of the deep state.
[03:52:36.951 --> 03:52:38.712]  They're on the side of the establishment.
[03:52:38.972 --> 03:52:40.812]  Trump represents the opposing force.
[03:52:41.052 --> 03:52:43.412]  So that's a narrative we've known to be true all along.
[03:52:43.673 --> 03:52:44.653]  That's what they've tried to hide.
[03:52:44.693 --> 03:52:46.553]  Now Conrad Black pointing out the truth.
[03:52:47.193 --> 03:52:48.613]  Again, I talked about it with Alex.
[03:52:48.653 --> 03:52:58.495]  A lot of the people who were, you know, globalists to some extent 10 years ago have now come across to the right side because people have chosen their side and many have chosen wisely.
[03:52:58.875 --> 03:53:01.816]  Let's move on to some global news now with the migrant crisis.
[03:53:01.836 --> 03:53:02.416]  This is out of RT.
[03:53:04.258 --> 03:53:10.822]  Headline, helicopters 100, hundreds of Austrian soldiers and police officers take part in migrant deterring drills.
[03:53:11.383 --> 03:53:21.870]  Hundreds of Austrian soldiers and police were involved in a border protection exercise that simulated containing migrants amid fears that neighbouring Germany might begin to turn away new arrivals trying to cross their frontier.
[03:53:22.563 --> 03:53:25.365]  So again, we've seen this massive uptick in the migrant crisis.
[03:53:26.145 --> 03:53:32.830]  Italy's turning away the boats, they're now going to Spain, they're now going to France, or at least trying to get there after they've docked in Spain.
[03:53:33.170 --> 03:53:44.237]  But now Austria have deployed 600 police, 400 soldiers and two Black Hawk helicopters in an exercise which simulated arrival of hundreds of migrants on the country's border with Slovenia, local media reported.
[03:53:45.097 --> 03:53:49.467]  A state that in the worst case cannot protect its borders loses its credibility.
[03:53:49.507 --> 03:53:55.019]  Interior Minister Herbert Kickle of the far right, it says, Freedom Party to all reporters.
[03:53:55.879 --> 03:53:58.520]  So again, they're expecting a new wave of migrants.
[03:53:59.101 --> 03:54:03.683]  Austria's made this pact with other Central European countries to defend their borders.
[03:54:04.023 --> 03:54:07.265]  The German interior minister is also on board with that idea.
[03:54:07.665 --> 03:54:08.666]  Angela Merkel isn't.
[03:54:08.726 --> 03:54:17.270]  There's an internal civil war basically within the German coalition government right now, which could lead to the end of Angela Merkel's political legacy.
[03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:18.771]  And Austria's ready.
[03:54:19.818 --> 03:54:20.878]  They're preparing for it.
[03:54:20.938 --> 03:54:22.219]  They're preparing for an invasion.
[03:54:22.259 --> 03:54:29.360]  We saw the Croatian border video a couple of days ago, where they were chanting Alaragbar, trying to break down the border to get in there.
[03:54:29.680 --> 03:54:37.062]  So as soon as one route gets shut off, another opens, because we still have these turncoat governments that are betraying their people.
[03:54:37.102 --> 03:54:42.503]  There you see the border situation in Croatia, where they tried to break through while chanting Alaragbar.
[03:54:43.264 --> 03:54:49.265]  But some countries are finally enforcing proper border security, given the huge problems that this has caused
[03:54:49.953 --> 03:54:53.754]  In virtually every European country that's accepted migrants over the past few years.
[03:54:54.614 --> 03:54:58.415]  Because we had the Aquarius boat dock in Spain last week.
[03:54:58.855 --> 03:55:10.658]  Soon as the migrants were sent to their holding locations in a town called Alicante, the local population of students who had paid for their accommodation were told they had 12 hours to get the hell out of there.
[03:55:11.018 --> 03:55:14.999]  Get out, you're being replaced by these migrants, and that's that.
[03:55:15.279 --> 03:55:16.420]  We saw that in other countries.
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:17.900]  We saw the video out of Italy with the old
[03:55:18.380 --> 03:55:30.326]  Fed and Breakfast owner literally being almost turfed out of his own home, ordered by police to allow migrants to stay there against his will, literally requisitioning his property to place migrants in there.
[03:55:30.846 --> 03:55:34.788]  And what results do we see from that legacy over the past three years?
[03:55:34.828 --> 03:55:35.909]  Well, here's another headline.
[03:55:37.268 --> 03:55:41.992]  40-year-old migrant arrested for murdering his 16-year-old teen bride in Sweden.
[03:55:42.292 --> 03:55:45.075]  This was an Afghan migrant who was arrested in Iran.
[03:55:45.115 --> 03:55:46.036]  Again, he escaped.
[03:55:46.456 --> 03:55:52.881]  We saw that in Germany with the headline you just flashed up before about the 14-year-old girl being strangled, raped and murdered in Germany.
[03:55:53.182 --> 03:55:55.023]  He was an Iraqi migrant who escaped.
[03:55:55.043 --> 03:55:56.665]  They managed to get him back and charge him.
[03:55:57.005 --> 03:56:01.609]  Now an Afghan migrant has been arrested in Iran for murdering his teen bride in Sweden.
[03:56:02.199 --> 03:56:07.560]  There was an international arrest warrant against the man who was taken back to Sweden and will face trial for the murder committed in 2016.
[03:56:07.620 --> 03:56:12.941]  The 40-year-old man should have been married to the 16-year-old girl Swedish media say.
[03:56:13.422 --> 03:56:18.123]  In March 2016 the teen was murdered and her husband has been wanted since June that year.
[03:56:18.143 --> 03:56:21.403]  They found her remains buried in a wood.
[03:56:21.743 --> 03:56:28.085]  So yet another murder of a young teenage girl blamed on migrants in a major European country.
[03:56:29.076 --> 03:56:34.359]  Because we had the whole narrative last week about, oh Trump's lying when he says that crime's risen in Germany.
[03:56:34.639 --> 03:56:40.903]  Well if you'd have put the word violent or if you'd have put the word migrant behind the word crime in that tweet, you would have been completely right.
[03:56:41.243 --> 03:56:53.810]  Because as Reuters admitted, as numerous other big publications admitted, BBC admitted as you see there, the rise in violent crime, the rise in political crime in Germany as well, talking about attacks on Jewish people mainly,
[03:56:54.452 --> 03:56:58.995]  And largely, in some cases, 90% of it be attributed to migrants.
[03:56:59.075 --> 03:57:05.378]  That's why when Trump talks about Europe having huge problems as a result of open borders, he's exactly right.
[03:57:06.340 --> 03:57:09.862]  Meanwhile in Italy, Italian Eurosceptic Coalition polling at nearly 60%.
[03:57:10.042 --> 03:57:16.006]  Italy's new Eurosceptic Anti-Mass Migration Coalition continues to enjoy large support.
[03:57:16.506 --> 03:57:19.568]  Now they've got up to 60% of the vote.
[03:57:19.688 --> 03:57:21.389]  This is the new coalition government.
[03:57:21.809 --> 03:57:23.830]  Liga alone were at 17% back in March.
[03:57:25.251 --> 03:57:26.052]  Now they're at 29%.
[03:57:27.093 --> 03:57:38.144]  They've almost doubled their support, specifically as a result of Salvini enforcing proper border security, turning away these boats and making Italy great again.
[03:57:38.464 --> 03:57:43.389]  And that's what Donald Trump wants to follow with his legacy when it comes to the border.
[03:57:43.609 --> 03:57:45.050]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour.
[03:57:45.090 --> 03:57:46.932]  Coming up, War Room with Owen Schroer.
[03:57:47.313 --> 03:57:48.994]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:49.014 --> 03:57:49.455]  We'll be back.
[03:57:53.319 --> 03:57:54.960]  Well, I've been wanting to get this lady on for a while.
[03:57:54.980 --> 03:57:56.341]  We're going to her in about a minute.
[03:57:57.141 --> 03:57:59.222]  Katie Hopkins over in the UK, but she's in the U.S.
[03:57:59.262 --> 03:57:59.562]  a lot.
[03:58:00.023 --> 03:58:00.923]  Banned off Twitter.
[03:58:02.044 --> 03:58:03.104]  They want her kicked off TV.
[03:58:03.224 --> 03:58:06.606]  Another reason I wanted to get her on is the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[03:58:06.826 --> 03:58:13.650]  State-sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area, and it's about killing her, and she's had an attempt on her life.
[03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:15.371]  So, this is next level.
[03:58:15.471 --> 03:58:19.173]  And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're vibrant, and I'm married, but I gotta say,
[03:58:20.013 --> 03:58:21.295]  You are pretty sexy.
[03:58:21.335 --> 03:58:24.318]  Well, if you think I'm sexy, I will say I think you need your eyes tested.
[03:58:24.358 --> 03:58:27.401]  But I do think strong women are really fun to be around.
[03:58:27.441 --> 03:58:30.464]  And the reason my government is sponsoring a play... Well, that's what I'm saying.
[03:58:30.504 --> 03:58:31.505]  Look, I don't think you look bad.
[03:58:31.545 --> 03:58:33.567]  My point is, it's attitudes what matters.
[03:58:33.807 --> 03:58:35.909]  You have light in your eyes.
[03:58:36.109 --> 03:58:36.989]  You have light in your eyes.
[03:58:37.009 --> 03:58:42.210]  I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday, and they look like they're zombies.
[03:58:42.390 --> 03:58:45.911]  It's not that they're even ugly, they look like something sucked their soul.
[03:58:46.091 --> 03:58:54.713]  The reason the state wants to run the play called The Assassination of Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
[03:58:55.173 --> 03:58:57.194]  One of the things the state loves is fear.
[03:58:57.414 --> 03:58:59.234]  They can control people when they're afraid.
