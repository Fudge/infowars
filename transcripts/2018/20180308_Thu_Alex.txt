[00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:15.999]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:22.463]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:25.326]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:28.948]  In the driver's seat today for Alex, I am Owen Schroer.
[00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:31.430]  We do have Alex over the phone.
[00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.333]  He's going to give us an update on the latest attack on InfoWars.
[00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.614]  Alex, what's going on?
[00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:38.515]  They're trying to censor us and shut us down.
[00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:39.316]  What are we dealing with now?
[00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:40.829]  Oh, that's right.
[00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.139]  We've got amazingly positive news, actually, today.
[00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:45.925]  Just incredibly positive news.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.483]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm only going to do two segments with you because I know you've got a full plate today, but huge developments.
[00:00:53.483 --> 00:01:02.807]  The head of the Trump campaign and really one of the key people in the White House right now, way more important than Stephen Bannon ever was for my sources, is Brad Parscale.
[00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:04.848]  You never hear about him because he's behind the scenes.
[00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:11.230]  He's the tech expert and all the rest of it who helped galvanize the American people through the internet to get around the globalist.
[00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.091]  He's come out on the records of the President
[00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:17.108]  And said that Big Tech, we're watching you.
[00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:21.574]  If you don't want to get busted up for being monopolies, you better stop the censorship.
[00:01:21.574 --> 00:01:24.558]  So we're going to read his tweets, cover all that next segment.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.742]  They're now saying if you talk about globalism, it's anti-semitic.
[00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:32.786]  So I guess if you talk about freedom, they can just say the word freedom is anti-semitic, so we ban that.
[00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:36.669]  We've got that coming up, because globalism just means a system of world government.
[00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:39.731]  The biggest globalist in the world is the Chinese Communist dictator.
[00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:42.413]  He's the guy, they say, they think is going to hold the whole thing together.
[00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:46.436]  Of course, David Rockefeller basically created it, and that guy wasn't Jewish.
[00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:48.958]  So, pretty desperate.
[00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:49.999]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.480]  And so much more.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:08.393]  But before we get into all of that, I just briefly wanted to get into Matt Fury, the individual that created, I guess, a decade ago, Pepe the Frog, that we really don't care about, that became a symbol of the campaign, a meme, not a meme we created or even really picked up on.
[00:02:08.393 --> 00:02:15.599]  And of course, we've been selling a poster that a third-party artist made that's got a bunch of images from 2016.
[00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.680]  Totally protected speech.
[00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.286]  Transformative art.
[00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:25.616]  But beyond that, beyond that, we're a third party selling it, so no connection will be instantly thrown out of court.
[00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.278]  The problem is it'll cost us money to deal with it.
[00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:32.547]  That's why we have to counter-sue with slap-back statutes, or the Democrats will just keep killing us.
[00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:34.653]  Death by a thousand cuts.
[00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.314]  So, people aren't going to get a paper cut back now when they sue us.
[00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:42.755]  They're going to get a giant war hammer of depositions, PIs, and everything else.
[00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:44.635]  So, enjoy yourselves.
[00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:45.815]  Everybody's already on the ground.
[00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:46.415]  Start enjoying.
[00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:48.976]  Now, that said, they want to fight.
[00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:50.476]  They got one.
[00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:59.958]  Thirdly, third strike, and even more devastating, our own Michael Zimmerman, intrepid researcher at InfoWars, found this from the Daily Dot
[00:03:01.084 --> 00:03:01.825]  We're good to go.
[00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:25.225]  We're good to go.
[00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:47.896]  We're good to go.
[00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:12.839]  Fraudulently applied, uh, abusively applied to shut down free speech worldwide.
[00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:19.704]  That's why the left, you know, the good left, was so against TPP, along with the libertarian right, because it was so draconian.
[00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:21.626]  So, this is unbelievable.
[00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:25.789]  He says, use it, it's public use, it's free to use.
[00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.530]  Everybody then uses it.
[00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.673]  An artist creates a poster with 5% of the poster being Pepe.
[00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:33.895]  Images of the campaign, totally protected.
[00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:35.957]  Supreme Court rulings, just incredibly protected.
[00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:46.442]  And then he goes further, puts out a press release, libeling us, saying we're white supremacists basically, tying our name to it, to defame us.
[00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:47.543]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.817]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:03.817 --> 00:05:07.778]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:11.120]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.660]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.402]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:20.743]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:20.743 --> 00:05:27.145]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:35.951]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:41.015]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:47.981]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:53.542]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:57.444]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:57.444 --> 00:06:08.787]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:11.087]  Don't worry about it, actually.
[00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:12.768]  Let him do whatever he wants.
[00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:12.968]  Bring it.
[00:06:21.018 --> 00:06:30.176]  Well, huge news breaking right now, where InfoWars is under attack, free speech is under attack, conservative speech is under attack.
[00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:32.324]  Well, we're fighting back.
[00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:45.277]  Not only is our audience fighting back by supporting us at Infowarsstore.com, now you have the Trump administration, the Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, warning Big Tech on Twitter, hey Facebook, Google, Twitter, Facebook, everybody, we're watching.
[00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:48.560]  This is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is level.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.943]  Alex Jones obviously was spearheading the
[00:06:53.044 --> 00:06:56.008]  Watching of the big tech giants that are centering conservatives.
[00:06:56.008 --> 00:06:58.130]  He's on the phone with us now.
[00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:05.319]  Alex, when you saw this, what was the first thing that came to your mind seeing Trump's new campaign manager saying, hey, look, big tech, we're watching you.
[00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.180]  We know what you're doing.
[00:07:07.904 --> 00:07:29.717]  Well, we knew this was coming thanks to the audience, and thanks to Drudge Report, and thanks to everybody else speaking out and pointing out that there is a purge of not just M4s, but thousands and thousands of Christian pro-gun, pro-military shooting clubs, you name it, in the last three weeks, and that actually News Corp.
[00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:31.889]  We're good to go.
[00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:58.060]  Which means really head of Trump's outreach to the public for the next three years as we go into 2020.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.965]  So the Trump administration fires first shot across big tech's bowed, warns them of censorship.
[00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:11.409]  Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale warns big tech, we are watching.
[00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:12.590]  And then we've got his tweet here.
[00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.792]  Hey, Facebook, Twitter and Google, we are watching.
[00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:18.954]  This is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is level.
[00:08:18.954 --> 00:08:20.855]  And of course, the playing field is not level.
[00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:45.738]  Hillary is openly cheerleading that she's planning to run again insanely or Joe Biden that don't worry she'll win because by the time she runs and by the time 2018 is over they're gonna have internet censorship in place but the great news is now the White House gets it they know what's going on they've put two top lawyers in at the Securities and Exchange Commission and also the Federal Trade Commission
[00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.330]  We're good to go.
[00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:14.858]  The lion's share of credit, and it's not about credit, but we need to realize how close we are to oblivion.
[00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:30.467]  If Drudge hadn't pointed out the conservative purge starting three weeks ago, and followed Dr. Corsi being banned, and us being banned, and everybody else being banned, and linked directly to it, and made it the number one story off and on for several days, it wouldn't have broken out.
[00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:32.549]  It wouldn't have gotten to the White House.
[00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:34.670]  So thank God for DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.311]  This is a huge situation.
[00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:37.772]  I hope throughout the day you cover it more.
[00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:50.323]  And talk about all the guests, because we as an audience need to keep pushing this and let this be their waterloo, because they thought they'd come in, censor us, engage in incredibly draconian, abusive systems.
[00:09:50.323 --> 00:10:00.274]  They thought that they would get away with all of this, but now it is completely and totally and absolutely blown up in their face spectacularly, but we've got to keep pushing, keep pushing.
[00:10:00.974 --> 00:10:02.855]  We're getting ready to file lawsuits.
[00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:04.215]  We've got a lot going on, obviously.
[00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:07.116]  They keep hitting us with new ones while we prepare for the next ones.
[00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:08.496]  But we are preparing the lawsuits.
[00:10:08.496 --> 00:10:12.677]  We're preparing the protest against Google, Twitter, Facebook.
[00:10:12.677 --> 00:10:14.118]  They want to fight, they've got one.
[00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:15.278]  That's our motto here.
[00:10:15.278 --> 00:10:18.119]  You want to fight, but only if you've got one, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:18.699]  So it's on.
[00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:21.420]  Now shifting gears to another huge top story.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.280]  You knew it was coming.
[00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:28.700]  They denied global government, they denied corporate world government, they're tax-exempt and above the law.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:51.151]  But once you force people to admit that Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon pay zero tax, that they run basically Chinese slave factories in many cases, in the case of Apple and others, once you show they're allied with the Communist Chinese, people get why they're funding leftist movements, why they're funding the breakup of the family, why they're funding the beta male movement to weaken this country, and they brag about it, and they celebrate it, it's a sickening, admitted,
[00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:58.600]  Total and complete takeover, like the goals of the communists that came out in the House Committee on American Activities in the 50s.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.024]  They said the plan is to break up the family and emasculate the male.
[00:11:02.024 --> 00:11:04.928]  Well, that has been done, and it's all declassified now.
[00:11:04.928 --> 00:11:09.254]  Those of us that are resisting are now called the enemy, and it's an incredible time to be alive, so...
[00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:26.870]  Now at Huffington Post, MSNBC, you name it, they're saying when people bring up the fact that, okay, you know, you're getting rid of globalists, you know, we're getting rid of people, Fox News asked the question, like Cohen and others, that believe in global government, that believe in a private corporate group basically ruling the world.
[00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:31.360]  Will Trump bring in another globalist?
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.761]  And I don't care if he brings in globalists, as long as we get our policies.
[00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:36.662]  Because globalists know how to get things done and where the bodies are buried.
[00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.063]  It's all about policy.
[00:11:38.063 --> 00:11:39.944]  They're now calling that anti-Semitic.
[00:11:39.944 --> 00:11:43.265]  Now listen, David Rockefeller created modern globalism.
[00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:45.966]  It just means private, corporate, world government, tax exempt.
[00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:47.569]  I think so.
[00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:14.572]  Went to Davos 14 months ago, 13 months ago, in 2017 and said, I will defeat Trump.
[00:12:14.572 --> 00:12:15.953]  I will defeat America.
[00:12:15.953 --> 00:12:17.633]  All us globalists rally behind China.
[00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:18.134]  We will win.
[00:12:18.134 --> 00:12:24.077]  Juncker, the heir to the Nazi fortune, the dictator of the EU, unelected, said, I agree.
[00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:28.379]  We will join forces to stop America and stop their economic recovery.
[00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:29.320]  And we'll launch economic
[00:12:30.703 --> 00:12:31.223]  We're good to go.
[00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:47.774]  We're good to go.
[00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.693]  People working together.
[00:13:10.693 --> 00:13:12.234]  That's fine.
[00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:14.196]  I'm not against people being international.
[00:13:14.196 --> 00:13:15.156]  That's great.
[00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:18.679]  What I'm saying is globalism is an authoritarian world model.
[00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:23.703]  So now they're saying, if you try to engage in resisting that and exposing it, you're anti-Semitic.
[00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:27.186]  Well, next, if they don't like the word America or freedom, they'll just say it's anti-Semitic.
[00:13:27.186 --> 00:13:28.987]  They already said the Declaration of Independence is bad.
[00:13:28.987 --> 00:13:32.550]  They already said that the Star-Spangled Banner is evil.
[00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:34.542]  This is the plan.
[00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:37.085]  They can't deny globalism is the world system.
[00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:38.366]  They can't deny it's authoritarian.
[00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:40.068]  So now they're just going to claim it's anti-semitic.
[00:13:40.068 --> 00:13:44.453]  Here is a short clip of Sarah Huckabee Sanders being asked about it.
[00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:45.554]  Just about Gary Cohn.
[00:13:45.554 --> 00:13:47.576]  He was a noted free trader or globalist.
[00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:50.879]  Will the president seek another globalist, another free trader?
[00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:55.164]  I'm not going to get ahead of the president's announcement on who will replace Gary.
[00:13:59.525 --> 00:14:04.568]  So there you go, and then they go on to say, oh my gosh, will he be replaced with another globalist?
[00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:08.630]  And that just means someone that supports this hegemonic global power structure.
[00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.012]  Owen Schroer, I've got a few other topics I'm going to hit after this break, and then I'm going to turn the ship over to you.
[00:14:13.012 --> 00:14:22.497]  I've got some really interesting, important information going on here with not just California, but Colorado and other areas.
[00:14:22.497 --> 00:14:24.358]  Just watching the local news while I'm here in Colorado.
[00:14:25.757 --> 00:14:26.738]  Well, I've been trying to watch.
[00:14:26.738 --> 00:14:28.118]  I was in a restaurant and saw it.
[00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:31.400]  An illegal alien who's done hit-and-runs, other crimes, you name it.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.702]  The Sheriff's Department's protecting him from deportation.
[00:14:34.702 --> 00:14:38.144]  We've also got, you know, out in California, it turns out, ICE.
[00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:43.247]  People were warned about ICE who were convicted felons, robbers, rapists, you name it.
[00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:47.009]  I mean, this is just the lawlessness of the globalist, waging war against this country.
[00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:48.190]  But look how far we've come, Owen.
[00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:57.018]  But now, globalism's out in the open, world government's out in the open, big tech censorship of nationalists, conservatives, Christians, veterans is out in the open.
[00:14:57.018 --> 00:15:03.025]  I mean, I'm telling you, as long as we fight back, we're gonna win, and that's why this audience is so awesome, because they are the heart of this thing.
[00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:14.997]  Well, and I think the fact that Brad Parscale is warning Facebook, Twitter, and Google tells you that he sees our audience crying, saying, look at the censorship of free speech.
[00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.098]  He sees Infowars.
[00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:16.798]  He sees everyone.
[00:15:16.798 --> 00:15:21.762]  He sees Republican candidates that are getting banned on Facebook, getting banned on Twitter.
[00:15:21.762 --> 00:15:24.063]  And so he's like, look, we're watching you.
[00:15:24.063 --> 00:15:25.664]  We see what's going on.
[00:15:25.664 --> 00:15:27.105]  This is the Infowar.
[00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:30.428]  You better have a level playing field, or I don't know, maybe there's a
[00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.330]  Is Trump just giving them rope to hang themselves, or is he not acting enough?
[00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:33.770]  Please take action now!
[00:16:00.205 --> 00:16:07.892]  Ever since ID Stronghold created RFID blocking wallet technology over 10 years ago, major designer brands have tried to create their own versions.
[00:16:07.892 --> 00:16:09.313]  But do they really work?
[00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:16.179]  We let real people test designer brand RFID blocking wallets using the same rigorous testing ID Stronghold wallets go through.
[00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:17.601]  So how did the designer brands do?
[00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:23.484]  I expected notable brands to perform well, and I was pretty surprised to see that it was not fully protected.
[00:16:23.484 --> 00:16:28.947]  Wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't really do what they're advertising that they do.
[00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:34.130]  Get a Stronghold on your credit cards, license, and other critical data with i-D Stronghold wallets.
[00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.872]  Other RFID blocking wallets simply aren't the same.
[00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:39.193]  i-D Stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect.
[00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:42.655]  I would definitely recommend i-D Stronghold wallets to my friends and family.
[00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:43.696]  Check the label.
[00:16:43.696 --> 00:16:46.679]  If it doesn't say it's an ID Stronghold, it's not.
[00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:49.182]  I'm very impressed with the ID Stronghold wallet.
[00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:55.770]  Get the most trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic pickpocketing.

[00:16:58.783 --> 00:17:03.905]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:09.608]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:17:09.608 --> 00:17:14.811]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:16.752]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:17:16.752 --> 00:17:19.133]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:17:19.133 --> 00:17:20.073]  See guidelines.
[00:17:20.073 --> 00:17:23.375]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.316]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:27.157]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:35.369]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[00:17:35.369 --> 00:17:39.631]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[00:17:39.631 --> 00:17:44.252]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:09.398]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.398 --> 00:18:17.502]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.782 --> 00:18:22.645]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.645 --> 00:18:29.450]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:36.635]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.635 --> 00:18:43.659]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:47.602]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:47.602 --> 00:18:48.483]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[00:18:48.483 --> 00:18:49.705]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:07.272]  Great!
[00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.393]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:19:08.393 --> 00:19:12.917]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:14.618]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:19:14.618 --> 00:19:22.204]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:22.785]  Wow, thank you.
[00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:25.447]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[00:19:25.447 --> 00:19:26.988]  Which super surgical do you like best?
[00:19:27.228 --> 00:19:30.711]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.232]  That's amazing.
[00:19:31.232 --> 00:19:31.993]  That's really incredible.
[00:19:31.993 --> 00:19:35.056]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:19:35.056 --> 00:19:36.397]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[00:19:36.397 --> 00:19:38.058]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:19:38.058 --> 00:19:39.320]  And I love you guys.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.482]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:47.187]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence.
[00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.328]  Just buy it.
[00:19:48.328 --> 00:19:49.369]  You will love it.
[00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:49.870]  I'm telling you.
[00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.191]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:55.913]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:55.913 --> 00:20:03.896]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:03.896 --> 00:20:06.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:30.694]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:32.216]  Well, we're making America great again.
[00:20:33.547 --> 00:20:40.071]  Alex Jones is enjoying the spoils of capitalism right now, but cannot take a break because we're constantly under attack.
[00:20:40.071 --> 00:20:45.455]  But it looks like the Trump administration has our back, as Brad Parscale tweets out today.
[00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:48.136]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, we're watching you.
[00:20:48.136 --> 00:20:49.237]  We know what you're doing.
[00:20:49.237 --> 00:20:52.940]  You've got a chance now to level the playing field, and we're watching you.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.341]  Alex, I don't think they're going to get the message though.
[00:20:56.341 --> 00:20:57.561]  I don't think they're going to get the message.
[00:20:57.561 --> 00:20:59.762]  I think they have to continue with their plan of censorship.
[00:20:59.762 --> 00:21:01.603]  They have to stop us from getting the truth out.
[00:21:01.603 --> 00:21:04.504]  They have to stop independent media from being free thinkers.
[00:21:04.504 --> 00:21:08.285]  So, I think that what you alluded to earlier is kind of accurate.
[00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:16.848]  I think maybe this is just baiting them and maybe them getting a false air of confidence here just so the next round of warnings to come through.
[00:21:17.961 --> 00:21:19.062]  Well, absolutely.
[00:21:19.062 --> 00:21:20.782]  And I've seen this with Trump over and over again.
[00:21:20.782 --> 00:21:34.268]  He's taking the high road and giving a rope to censor and censor and censor and then build huge amounts of anger in the country so that we then have the political capital to actually punish these authoritarians.
[00:21:34.268 --> 00:21:45.232]  But words cannot describe how draconian thousands of Christian, number one Christian, number two, Second Amendment, number three, libertarian style talk radio.
[00:21:45.232 --> 00:21:46.333]  All of us have been censored.
[00:21:47.305 --> 00:21:50.027]  Well, a huge scale never before seen.
[00:21:50.027 --> 00:21:54.269]  Project Veritas has caught them all on tape, bragging how they do it.
[00:21:54.269 --> 00:22:00.993]  We have them when it comes to lawsuits, but they're acting like they're going to take over and overthrow Trump, and that none of that's going to matter.
[00:22:00.993 --> 00:22:07.437]  They have a race to the finish line attitude to all of this, and it's so lawless what they're doing.
[00:22:07.437 --> 00:22:08.438]  So I agree with you.
[00:22:08.438 --> 00:22:12.320]  I don't think Trump can have his normal policy of, you know, letting them have more rope.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.642]  They've already got plenty of rope.
[00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:16.703]  And here's the takeaway for me.
[00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:31.925]  The Democrats, the Globalists, all over the world, leftist parties, funded by George Soros and others, are making their move to end free speech, to end nationalism, to end the family, to end Christianity, to end sovereignty.
[00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:35.327]  I mean, Apple's merging with Communist China.
[00:22:35.327 --> 00:22:37.848]  The Pope's saying Communist China is the ultimate form of Christianity.
[00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:42.690]  Easter has been taken off Apple's calendar, and they said, no, we did that on purpose, but Ramadan's on there.
[00:22:44.142 --> 00:22:51.906]  This is a globalist move against us by a yardstick, and the attacks on the First Amendment in this country are way beyond the second right now.
[00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:54.727]  And it comes first because it protects the second.
[00:22:54.727 --> 00:22:56.968]  If the first fails, then it goes to the second.
[00:22:56.968 --> 00:22:58.329]  It is number one for a reason.
[00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:02.571]  I agree with the founders, and if anybody was gun nuts, it was them.
[00:23:02.571 --> 00:23:05.532]  The first is more important than the second because it motivates everything.
[00:23:05.532 --> 00:23:06.333]  With the First Amendment,
[00:23:06.873 --> 00:23:13.966]  If I still have that and they've taken all our guns, I can still motivate people to wake up and take action and take the guns from the enemy and win again.
[00:23:13.966 --> 00:23:15.229]  Go out the first!
[00:23:16.389 --> 00:23:21.953]  No amount of guns matter because you don't have command and control and leadership and ideology and policy and ideas.
[00:23:21.953 --> 00:23:25.456]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we carry the light in the dark of the night.
[00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:26.737]  This is epic history.
[00:23:26.737 --> 00:23:30.460]  And that's why I start hyperventilating, because this is so crazy.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:38.146]  But because of you getting upset, listeners, and because of Drudge getting upset, and because of Congressman, and I gotta give credit to him, he's so articulate and so great.
[00:23:38.146 --> 00:23:41.989]  Senator Ted Cruz, that's why when he got a little bit dirty during the campaign, I got really upset with him.
[00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:44.951]  But he's totally decimating in congressional hearings.
[00:23:44.951 --> 00:23:45.792]  We played those clips.
[00:23:46.736 --> 00:23:47.637]  But they can't stop.
[00:23:47.637 --> 00:23:50.679]  The more they get exposed, the more they censor.
[00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:51.919]  Because they're like corner rats.
[00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:54.161]  So, ladies and gentlemen, you did it.
[00:23:54.161 --> 00:23:54.941]  You got upset.
[00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:55.622]  You backed them off.
[00:23:57.086 --> 00:24:11.053]  And then, predictably, BuzzFeed, The Washington Post, other fake news outlets said that we made it up, no one was censored, there wasn't a part, there wasn't CNN calling for our banning, there wasn't CNN trying to take our sponsors, there wasn't CNN trying to block my book being published.
[00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:12.174]  Of course, all that happened.
[00:24:12.174 --> 00:24:18.257]  There wasn't Pepe the Frog lawsuit, or the Communist Party suing us, or other lawsuits I'm not going to get into yet on air.
[00:24:18.257 --> 00:24:19.377]  All Democratic Party.
[00:24:19.377 --> 00:24:23.940]  I have two former Clinton lawyers that were directly under her suing me right now, okay?
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.681]  I mean, two of the biggest law firms in the country.
[00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:27.642]  We're good to go.
[00:24:45.777 --> 00:24:52.725]  And they just don't care because there's this idea that they're going to win because they're mobilized and they're aggressive.
[00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:54.307]  We have to get mobilized.
[00:24:54.307 --> 00:24:55.268]  We have to get aggressive.
[00:24:55.268 --> 00:24:56.750]  And in closing, I'm going to hand this over to Owen.
[00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.351]  Doing a great job.
[00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:01.840]  Financially, I have committed to sue these people for everybody's free speech.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.820]  These are watershed cases for everybody, just as important as the Second Amendment.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:12.142]  Just like I tell folks who join the NRA and Gun Owners of America, you join us by signing up for auto-ship and getting fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:25:12.142 --> 00:25:16.983]  If everybody just got our super blue fluoride-free toothpaste, four to five coils of silver and iodine, nobody else has got it.
[00:25:16.983 --> 00:25:20.423]  It's super popular, 5,000 plus, five-star reviews.
[00:25:20.423 --> 00:25:24.484]  That would fund our operation, but only maybe 1% of our audience buys stuff, and I'm not complaining.
[00:25:25.809 --> 00:25:27.111]  I'm just saying, folks, I'm committed.
[00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:27.912]  I need your commitment.
[00:25:27.912 --> 00:25:30.736]  Everybody just signs up for AutoShip once a month to get the toothpaste.
[00:25:30.736 --> 00:25:31.476]  It's great.
[00:25:31.476 --> 00:25:33.299]  We'll make three, four bucks on each tube.
[00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:36.423]  That would fund the operation right there and help me defend the First Amendment.
[00:25:36.423 --> 00:25:37.644]  They're coming after us all.
[00:25:37.644 --> 00:25:42.250]  It's like they're trying to shut down, you know, Patrick Henry or Sam Adams Printing Press.
[00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.251]  This is really going
[00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:45.072]  We're rolling down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:45.072 --> 00:25:47.992]  And so, we need you to continue to commit.
[00:25:47.992 --> 00:25:48.673]  Spread the word.
[00:25:48.673 --> 00:25:49.353]  Spread the articles.
[00:25:49.353 --> 00:25:49.913]  Spread the videos.
[00:25:49.913 --> 00:25:50.653]  It's a fight.
[00:25:50.653 --> 00:25:51.253]  Twelve rounds.
[00:25:51.253 --> 00:25:52.394]  We're about seven rounds in.
[00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:54.234]  We're winning, but both sides are bloody.
[00:25:54.234 --> 00:25:57.995]  And we've got a bunch of specials that, in this week, have extended last week.
[00:25:57.995 --> 00:25:59.316]  30% to 80% off.
[00:25:59.316 --> 00:26:00.116]  Brain Force.
[00:26:00.116 --> 00:26:02.197]  Super Male, Super Female Vitality.
[00:26:02.197 --> 00:26:04.037]  Alpha Power.
[00:26:04.037 --> 00:26:04.537]  Bodies.
[00:26:04.537 --> 00:26:07.758]  Our great tumor formula, I think, still sold out, but I hear ads running for it.
[00:26:07.758 --> 00:26:09.319]  All these products are going to stay at this price.
[00:26:10.541 --> 00:26:11.422]  For the rest of the week.
[00:26:11.422 --> 00:26:13.003]  But a lot of them are selling out.
[00:26:13.003 --> 00:26:14.284]  Thank you for your support.
[00:26:14.284 --> 00:26:17.205]  But again, without you, ladies and gentlemen, we are nothing.
[00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:18.686]  And they just hope you forget.
[00:26:18.686 --> 00:26:21.108]  They hope you just roll over, but you're not.
[00:26:21.108 --> 00:26:22.529]  And they're so upset.
[00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:23.430]  They don't know what to do.
[00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.351]  And please, finally, pray for the broadcast.
[00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.932]  Pray for Providence.
[00:26:26.932 --> 00:26:28.173]  Pray for the country to awaken.
[00:26:28.173 --> 00:26:31.677]  And please support our local AM and FM affiliates and TV affiliates.
[00:26:31.677 --> 00:26:32.738]  Become a sponsor.
[00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:34.119]  Let them know you appreciate them.
[00:26:34.119 --> 00:26:36.622]  Tithe 20 bucks, wherever you can, a month to them.
[00:26:36.622 --> 00:26:40.946]  And all the middle class people and everybody else that's on the sidelines that thanked me and patted me on the back.
[00:26:40.946 --> 00:26:42.908]  Listen, I need you to get involved.
[00:26:42.908 --> 00:26:44.809]  I need you to write letters to the editor.
[00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:45.991]  I need you to call C-SPAN.
[00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:46.331]  Get out.
[00:26:46.431 --> 00:26:46.811]  I don't know.
[00:27:04.568 --> 00:27:06.889]  They are going to come for the free speech.
[00:27:06.889 --> 00:27:09.030]  They are going to go full authoritarian.
[00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:13.831]  They were gearing up for that for a long time, but our police and military woke up to it and didn't go along with it.
[00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:19.133]  That's why they started all the cop killing and the Strong Cities Initiative to bully them under UN control.
[00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:20.254]  This is mainstream news.
[00:27:20.254 --> 00:27:23.955]  Think how crazy this is to go along with their plan, but that failed as well.
[00:27:23.955 --> 00:27:26.916]  We are in an epic, tectonic, ultra-massive battle.
[00:27:27.176 --> 00:27:27.436]  We're good.
[00:27:42.393 --> 00:27:48.216]  That will defeat them in the end, and they thought they'd buried us, but I was a seed, and then it backfired.
[00:27:48.216 --> 00:27:50.477]  All right, back to Owen Shore and the rest of the crew.
[00:27:50.477 --> 00:27:52.738]  Please commit to infowarshore.com.
[00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:53.939]  Great products you need.
[00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:54.820]  Shop with a good guy.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.800]  Sign up for auto ship.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.001]  Get 10% off additionally.
[00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:57.961]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:27:57.961 --> 00:27:59.122]  I should have added that.
[00:27:59.122 --> 00:28:00.042]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:28:00.042 --> 00:28:01.463]  It's all gonna end this weekend.
[00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:03.104]  Thank you, Owen, and back to the amazing crew.
[00:28:03.104 --> 00:28:03.344]  Thank you.
[00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:11.559]  So there goes Alex Jones, and I'm sure he'll have multiple reports and other special reports as well as this is all developing.
[00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:20.083]  And you know, it's amazing, just in the just over a year and a half that I've been here at InfoWars, I've seen it grow exponentially with your support.
[00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:27.967]  And I don't see Alex pulling up with a brand new fancy car every day, you know, buying an airplane or a jet or something, buying new mansions.
[00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:29.928]  No, I see him building new studios.
[00:28:29.928 --> 00:28:32.249]  I see him building actually two new studios right now.
[00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:33.789]  I see him hiring new people.
[00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:35.550]  I see him expanding the broadcast.
[00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:40.951]  So, your support at Infowarsstore.com goes back into everything that we do here.
[00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:47.073]  Hiring the crew, building these great studios, building new studios, expanding our broadcast.
[00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:54.955]  I mean, this is how we defeat the fake news, is by just getting bigger than them, and then just drowning them out.
[00:28:54.955 --> 00:28:57.076]  So we'll be right back with all the news on the other side.
[00:28:57.076 --> 00:28:58.116]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.971]  Hear that?
[00:29:00.971 --> 00:29:06.355]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:09.257]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:29:09.257 --> 00:29:12.839]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:20.405]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[00:29:20.405 --> 00:29:25.008]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[00:29:25.008 --> 00:29:27.430]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.870]  Faketv.com
[00:29:29.875 --> 00:29:30.695]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:29:30.695 --> 00:29:32.476]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:34.137]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:29:34.137 --> 00:29:36.959]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:29:36.959 --> 00:29:39.260]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.763]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:29:43.763 --> 00:29:47.705]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:29:47.705 --> 00:29:51.487]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:29:51.487 --> 00:29:51.807]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:29:51.807 --> 00:29:53.228]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:30:00.219 --> 00:30:07.775]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:30:09.361 --> 00:30:20.149]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:22.311]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:26.314]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:26.314 --> 00:30:33.560]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.962]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:30:35.962 --> 00:30:37.283]  We've got the best mouthwash
[00:30:37.663 --> 00:30:39.445]  Signed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad.
[00:30:39.445 --> 00:30:41.366]  With a little silver and iodine as well.
[00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:43.868]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:53.055]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:30:53.055 --> 00:30:57.519]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:01.274 --> 00:31:06.758]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:31:06.758 --> 00:31:07.598]  I take this.
[00:31:07.598 --> 00:31:08.719]  My family takes this.
[00:31:08.719 --> 00:31:13.002]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:31:13.002 --> 00:31:17.245]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:17.605 --> 00:31:22.248]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:23.368]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.368 --> 00:31:27.131]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:29.832]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:29.832 --> 00:31:35.636]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.636 --> 00:31:38.597]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.597 --> 00:31:42.119]  And I know my hair's a little luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:44.361]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:44.721]  I love it.
[00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:47.685]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:47.685 --> 00:31:48.687]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:48.687 --> 00:31:54.515]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:56.538]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:57.760]  It's a win-win.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.742]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.956 --> 00:32:01.736]  I'm so excited.
[00:32:01.736 --> 00:32:11.880]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:20.404]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:32:20.404 --> 00:32:29.187]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:31.294 --> 00:32:50.860]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.541]  It is amazing!
[00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:58.503]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:11.274]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.274 --> 00:33:17.138]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:17.138 --> 00:33:24.403]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.403 --> 00:33:30.867]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:30.867 --> 00:33:32.328]  There are distinct differences
[00:33:33.698 --> 00:33:42.788]  Between the left or liberals and the right or conservatives or Trump supporters, whatever you want to call it.
[00:33:42.788 --> 00:33:49.796]  In that, generally speaking, we don't really have double standards here.
[00:33:49.796 --> 00:33:53.841]  We're pretty much just straight down the line, call it as we see it.
[00:33:55.148 --> 00:33:58.311]  How you treat, how we treat you, we expect you to treat us.
[00:33:58.311 --> 00:34:04.757]  Now, you notice that we don't go on air every day calling for CNN to be shut off of cable news.
[00:34:04.757 --> 00:34:09.180]  We don't go on air every day saying that our opposition needs to be shut down.
[00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:18.266]  Well, I mean, I'll be honest with you, the only, I guess, quote-unquote, opposition that I think, well, it doesn't have to be shut down, it's just I think NPR should quit getting government funding.
[00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:22.189]  I would say any news outlet receiving government funding, that needs to be cut immediately.
[00:34:22.189 --> 00:34:26.192]  That doesn't necessarily mean they have to be shut down, but now you have to compete in the free market.
[00:34:26.192 --> 00:34:29.515]  But we don't call for them to be shut down.
[00:34:29.515 --> 00:34:31.577]  See, we're not Nazis.
[00:34:31.577 --> 00:34:32.918]  We're not authoritarians.
[00:34:32.918 --> 00:34:33.318]  In fact,
[00:34:34.466 --> 00:34:46.055]  I'm glad that Don Lemon goes on air for an hour a night and reads off a teleprompter and then once a week gives me a sound clip that I can expose him as a total moron here on the air.
[00:34:46.055 --> 00:34:47.937]  So that's perfectly fine.
[00:34:47.937 --> 00:34:48.917]  But that's not them.
[00:34:48.917 --> 00:34:50.399]  See, they call for censorship.
[00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:52.740]  CNN says we have to ban InfoWars.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.801]  They flag our videos.
[00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:56.423]  The Southern Poverty Law Center wants us shut down.
[00:34:56.423 --> 00:35:03.269]  Even Glenn Beck, the cuckservative Glenn Beck, even he wants us shut down.
[00:35:04.192 --> 00:35:09.856]  We've never called for Glenn Beck to be shut down.
[00:35:09.856 --> 00:35:14.078]  So that's the big difference, but it doesn't stop there, and I talked about this yesterday.
[00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:22.364]  If you're a Trump supporter, first let's say this, if you're a whatever, Hillary, Bernie, liberal, whatever it is you are,
[00:35:23.396 --> 00:35:30.140]  And you go to a conservative event, or a Trump event or something, and you're open-minded, you'll have a fine time.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.723]  People aren't going to be rude to you, they're not going to beat you up, they're not going to spit on you.
[00:35:33.723 --> 00:35:37.065]  As long as you're fair, you'll have a good time.
[00:35:37.065 --> 00:35:46.631]  Now, you take the opposite of that, and you say, oh, I'm a Trump supporter, I'll go to a Bernie event, or a Hillary event, or I'll go to a Trump protest.
[00:35:46.631 --> 00:35:48.132]  You've seen what happens.
[00:35:48.132 --> 00:35:49.313]  We film it.
[00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:51.795]  You get attacked, you get ridiculed, you get cursed at.
[00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:54.912]  You get spat on, you get coffee thrown at you.
[00:35:54.912 --> 00:35:56.753]  I mean, you know, you've seen it all.
[00:35:56.753 --> 00:35:57.293]  We've filmed it.
[00:35:57.293 --> 00:35:59.755]  So, we aren't the ones with double standards.
[00:35:59.755 --> 00:36:03.657]  We aren't the hypocrites.
[00:36:03.657 --> 00:36:04.977]  And we're also not the racists.
[00:36:04.977 --> 00:36:05.438]  That's them.
[00:36:05.438 --> 00:36:07.018]  We're also not the ones that colluded with Russia.
[00:36:07.018 --> 00:36:08.599]  That's Hillary.
[00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:09.680]  So it's funny how that works.
[00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:24.763]  Anyway, I've got, I mean, the news today, first of all, I need like Stretch Armstrong just to get all the way to the other side of the desk just to try to reach some of these stories.
[00:36:24.763 --> 00:36:26.344]  But the big news that we're blowing up
[00:36:28.393 --> 00:36:33.475]  We've got a story right now that we're working on at Infowars.com, breaking it all down.
[00:36:33.475 --> 00:36:41.419]  How we get strikes, and then it's one strike, two strike, three strikes, and then two strikes, and then three strikes again, and then two strikes, and then one strike.
[00:36:41.419 --> 00:36:45.621]  And then there's a media storm and a spin about it.
[00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:51.283]  And then you see a bunch of Republican candidates getting censored from Twitter and censored from Facebook.
[00:36:51.283 --> 00:36:57.146]  You see all the YouTube channels, the Christian channels, the gun activist channels, the
[00:36:59.475 --> 00:37:03.456]  Alternative media channels, Trump-supporting channels, they get shut down on YouTube.
[00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:05.117]  So all of this is going on in the backdrop.
[00:37:05.117 --> 00:37:11.779]  So then today, Brad Parscale tweets out, Hey Facebook, Twitter, Google, we are watching.
[00:37:11.779 --> 00:37:14.960]  This is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is level.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:21.122]  So to me, that's a warning to them saying, look, we know what you're doing.
[00:37:21.122 --> 00:37:22.362]  We know you're censoring people.
[00:37:22.362 --> 00:37:23.823]  We know that you have political bias.
[00:37:25.158 --> 00:37:30.483]  And if you continue to do this, we're going to have to take some action.
[00:37:30.483 --> 00:37:34.947]  This is your opportunity before we have to take action.
[00:37:34.947 --> 00:37:44.896]  Now I don't suspect those, the tech left, to actually hear this warning and they'll probably go about censorship as usual because they have to.
[00:37:46.681 --> 00:38:07.740]  This isn't something I think, of course they want to do it, but they also have to do it because they're losing on the battlefield of ideas, they're losing on the battlefield of policy, and they have to do everything they can to try to prop up the fake news against President Trump by silencing out reports and all of the noise that fights back against it.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.203]  But that's just one huge story today.
[00:38:11.203 --> 00:38:13.005]  Look at some of these other huge stories today.
[00:38:14.144 --> 00:38:16.026]  Now, they say we're Russian bots.
[00:38:16.026 --> 00:38:23.532]  They say that Russia has deceived Americans into supporting Trump, supporting the Second Amendment, supporting America somehow.
[00:38:23.532 --> 00:38:25.994]  That's Russian.
[00:38:25.994 --> 00:38:30.058]  But now this comes out.
[00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:33.101]  China's long arm reaches into American campuses.
[00:38:33.101 --> 00:38:37.224]  Beijing is stepping up efforts to inject party ideology into student life.
[00:38:37.224 --> 00:38:38.826]  Some Chinese students are crying foul.
[00:38:41.618 --> 00:38:52.182]  The story talks about basically how the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist government is infiltrating college campuses to spread the ideas of communism.
[00:38:52.182 --> 00:38:53.102]  Oh!
[00:38:53.102 --> 00:38:55.903]  And then this comes out from the Free Beacon.
[00:38:55.903 --> 00:39:04.466]  CIA warns of extensive Chinese operation to infiltrate American institutions.
[00:39:04.466 --> 00:39:08.067]  So, again, think about it like this.
[00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:18.149]  You've got herds of college students that march against Trump, indoctrinated liberal college students.
[00:39:18.149 --> 00:39:26.491]  They'll protest Trump, they'll march against Trump, and they'll say, you're a Russian operative, you've been fooled by Russia, you're a Russian VOT.
[00:39:26.491 --> 00:39:29.311]  These are communists!
[00:39:29.311 --> 00:39:37.933]  And so you sit here and you scratch your head and you say, why are college universities producing communists?
[00:39:39.861 --> 00:39:47.910]  You had the one graduate, was it from Navy or Army, I think West Point, who puts communism will win in his graduation cap?
[00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:51.414]  Why are these universities graduating communists in America?
[00:39:51.414 --> 00:39:53.276]  What the heck is going on?
[00:39:53.276 --> 00:39:59.603]  Now in the Cold War you had Russian communists infiltrating the education system to sow the seeds of communism.
[00:40:01.201 --> 00:40:08.987]  Now, you've got Chinese operations infiltrating the education system to sow the seeds of communism.
[00:40:08.987 --> 00:40:25.901]  So, for all of you liberal communist college students out there, for all of you socialist Bernie supporters out there at the university, for all of you indoctrinated liberals by your state-run public university, understand something.
[00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:28.223]  You're a Chinese operative.
[00:40:28.223 --> 00:40:30.044]  You have been hacked by China.
[00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:37.094]  You have been propagandized by China to thinking communism is great.
[00:40:37.094 --> 00:40:38.415]  How does it feel?
[00:40:38.415 --> 00:40:40.097]  You've been punked!
[00:40:40.097 --> 00:40:51.805]  You've been punked by Chinese propaganda to supporting communism instead of supporting capitalism that's given you everything you've ever imagined.
[00:40:54.281 --> 00:41:03.044]  Including the Grandos University that you go to to get the ideas of capitalism sewn in your head by Chinese infiltrators.
[00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:05.125]  Congratulations.
[00:41:05.125 --> 00:41:07.366]  So go march for Bernie Sanders.
[00:41:07.366 --> 00:41:09.126]  Go march against Trump.
[00:41:09.126 --> 00:41:10.347]  Go support communism.
[00:41:11.252 --> 00:41:16.637]  All the while thinking Trump supporters are Russian bots, Russian influenced.
[00:41:16.637 --> 00:41:19.940]  Understand, you've been deceived by China.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.981]  And you know what?
[00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:24.424]  It's not just the universities, it's Hollywood too.
[00:41:24.424 --> 00:41:26.726]  Because China's buying that.
[00:41:26.726 --> 00:41:32.211]  So the next time you want to look at a Trump supporter and say, Russia!
[00:41:32.211 --> 00:41:33.612]  Russia!
[00:41:33.612 --> 00:41:36.735]  Trump supporter Russia!
[00:41:36.735 --> 00:41:37.055]  Remember,
[00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:49.280]  In your indoctrinating education system at the state-run universities, they've been infiltrated by China, they've been infiltrated by communists, and they're sowing the seeds of communism.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.220]  That's an infiltration.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.742]  That's a foreign infiltration into your mind.
[00:41:53.742 --> 00:41:55.523]  You've actually been incepted!
[00:41:55.523 --> 00:41:57.044]  China has incepted you.
[00:41:57.044 --> 00:41:58.045]  How does that feel?
[00:41:58.045 --> 00:42:07.711]  China has now incepted college students to love communism and hate capitalism, and now they march against Trump and love crazy Bernie Sanders.
[00:42:08.686 --> 00:42:12.748]  And you cannot make this up.
[00:42:12.748 --> 00:42:24.695]  And then meanwhile, it was amazing how in the last year or two, terms like globalist, globalism, and deep state are now household terms.
[00:42:24.695 --> 00:42:26.576]  You hear them on the news every night.
[00:42:26.576 --> 00:42:32.740]  You never heard the term globalism, you never heard the term deep state, false flag, except right here.
[00:42:34.815 --> 00:42:35.915]  Until about two years ago.
[00:42:35.915 --> 00:42:41.217]  You never heard any of that, except right here, until about two years ago.
[00:42:41.217 --> 00:42:52.220]  But now the MSM, the mainstream media, is trying to twist it, and they're saying, the stories by Kit Daniels at Infowars.com, to say it's anti-Semitic, to say globalist.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.682]  No, it's just pro-nation-state, pro-sovereignty to not be a globalist.

[00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:29.052]  Mold's a scourge.

[00:46:00.014 --> 00:46:03.036]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:07.238]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:46:07.238 --> 00:46:13.921]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:17.683]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:46:18.403 --> 00:46:37.891]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:46:38.451 --> 00:46:42.572]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:46:42.572 --> 00:46:53.814]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:46:53.814 --> 00:47:03.395]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:47:03.395 --> 00:47:06.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.981 --> 00:47:19.182]  You found it.
[00:47:19.182 --> 00:47:21.203]  The tip of the spear.
[00:47:21.203 --> 00:47:32.029]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:34.590]  Oh, it's my favorite time of year in Austin, Texas.
[00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.191]  South by Southwest is here not.
[00:47:36.191 --> 00:47:40.033]  It's like my least favorite time of year to be honest.
[00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:41.634]  Traffic is worse.
[00:47:41.634 --> 00:47:43.175]  A bunch of smelly people invade.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:56.585]  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be mean here, but Me Too is taking over South by Southwest, so now it's going to be even more loving and liberal and tolerant, and you've got 50 panels.
[00:47:56.585 --> 00:47:58.606]  Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
[00:47:58.606 --> 00:48:00.926]  I don't want to sell you short here, folks.
[00:48:00.926 --> 00:48:09.610]  More than 50 panels, more than 50 hashtag Me Too panels focused on harassment and gender parity.
[00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:13.836]  What would we do without South by Southwest?
[00:48:13.836 --> 00:48:19.658]  Except have a lot better time next week in Austin, Texas.
[00:48:19.658 --> 00:48:23.359]  But, we'll be shooting reports, I'm sure.
[00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:24.600]  Oh my gosh.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.320]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.341]  I can't stand South by Southwest.
[00:48:27.341 --> 00:48:28.441]  Ugh.
[00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:30.242]  Ugh.
[00:48:30.242 --> 00:48:30.342]  Ugh!
[00:48:33.117 --> 00:48:36.999]  But we'll be filing reports, and we'll be out there, and we'll be dealing with it.
[00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:39.960]  You know, I went last year, you know they kicked me out?
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:51.624]  They literally, anytime we had people stalking me and my cameraman, anywhere we went, and they would harass us, and they kept telling us we had to move.
[00:48:51.624 --> 00:49:00.228]  More than 50 hashtag MeToo panels will be focusing on harassment and gender parity at South by Southwest this year.
[00:49:01.755 --> 00:49:06.516]  The reason why I'm actually going here, there is a rhyme to my reason.
[00:49:06.516 --> 00:49:12.298]  Bernie Sanders is going to be at South by Southwest tomorrow, being interviewed by Jake Tapper.
[00:49:12.298 --> 00:49:16.879]  So Tweety Bird will be interviewing the crazed socialist.
[00:49:16.879 --> 00:49:18.520]  Crazy Bernie.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.220]  What does Trump say?
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.820]  He's crazier than a bat or something?
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.721]  Bed bug!
[00:49:21.721 --> 00:49:23.841]  He's crazier than a bed bug!
[00:49:23.841 --> 00:49:25.042]  He kind of looks like a bed bug.
[00:49:25.042 --> 00:49:27.822]  He looks like he just rolled out a bed bug.
[00:49:27.822 --> 00:49:29.503]  So Tapper will be interviewing Bernie.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.480]  And that'll go just fine.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.361]  You've also got Sadiq Khan coming to town.
[00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:38.903]  I mean, see, this is why, you know, Bernie Sanders coming to town, Sadiq Khan coming to town.
[00:49:38.903 --> 00:49:39.743]  Ugh!
[00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:42.564]  Ugh!
[00:49:42.564 --> 00:49:43.725]  What does Sadiq Khan say?
[00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:46.906]  Well, whatever Sadiq Khan says, wherever Sadiq Khan goes,
[00:49:48.049 --> 00:49:50.873]  You know, terrorism just becomes part and parcel.
[00:49:50.873 --> 00:50:00.766]  So Sadiq Khan is coming to Austin, so I guess I should just expect terrorism to be part and parcel then too, because that's what happens when Sadiq Khan is in your city, according to Sadiq Khan.
[00:50:00.766 --> 00:50:03.129]  But you'll notice something.
[00:50:03.129 --> 00:50:04.951]  Although I don't know this for sure, but...
[00:50:05.982 --> 00:50:15.390]  I'm guessing that you're not going to have a bunch of rabid, foaming at the mouth, mask-wearing, violent protesters outside of Bernie Sanders' interview.
[00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:22.516]  I doubt you'll have a bunch of vile, disgusting hate mongers outside of Sadiq Khan's interview during South by Southwest.
[00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:35.100]  I highly doubt that any conservatives or any Trump supporters will be trying to shut those interviews down by using violence, intimidation, terrorist tactics, and Nazi tactics.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.241]  That's what the left does.
[00:50:37.241 --> 00:50:40.202]  And, I mean, these videos surface all the time.
[00:50:40.202 --> 00:50:46.304]  I had one in the news, I think it was yesterday or two days ago, I didn't even go to it, but here's Jordan Peterson goes to
[00:50:48.359 --> 00:50:52.120]  Queen's University, and of course, what happens?
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.082]  Violent leftist protesters storm it and want it shut down.
[00:50:58.082 --> 00:51:01.163]  Oh, burn it down!
[00:51:01.163 --> 00:51:02.323]  How loving.
[00:51:02.323 --> 00:51:04.324]  The guy is just like a philosopher.
[00:51:04.324 --> 00:51:05.704]  A logician, if you will.
[00:51:19.511 --> 00:51:20.371]  Look at these people.
[00:51:20.371 --> 00:51:20.531]  Shame!
[00:51:20.531 --> 00:51:20.652]  Shame!
[00:51:20.652 --> 00:51:20.932]  Shame!
[00:51:20.932 --> 00:51:21.372]  Shame!
[00:51:21.372 --> 00:51:21.652]  Shame!
[00:51:21.652 --> 00:51:21.812]  Shame!
[00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.193]  Shame!
[00:51:23.193 --> 00:51:23.333]  Shame!
[00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:23.513]  Shame!
[00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:23.633]  Shame!
[00:51:23.633 --> 00:51:23.793]  Shame!
[00:51:23.793 --> 00:51:24.113]  Shame!
[00:51:24.113 --> 00:51:24.373]  Shame!
[00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:24.673]  Shame!
[00:51:24.673 --> 00:51:25.033]  Shame!
[00:51:25.033 --> 00:51:25.174]  Shame!
[00:51:25.174 --> 00:51:25.314]  Shame!
[00:51:25.314 --> 00:51:25.494]  Shame!
[00:51:25.494 --> 00:51:25.694]  Shame!
[00:51:25.694 --> 00:51:25.834]  Shame!
[00:51:25.834 --> 00:51:26.014]  Shame!
[00:51:26.014 --> 00:51:26.214]  Shame!
[00:51:26.214 --> 00:51:26.374]  Shame!
[00:51:26.374 --> 00:51:26.674]  Shame!

[00:51:45.622 --> 00:51:45.742]  Shame
[00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:52.792]  Chanting, trying to shut things down, saying burn people.
[00:51:52.792 --> 00:52:00.416]  No.
[00:52:00.416 --> 00:52:02.497]  Shame on you!
[00:52:02.497 --> 00:52:03.337]  Shame on you!
[00:52:03.337 --> 00:52:06.239]  Look at her harassing this young girl.
[00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:08.800]  She's just like, hello, I'm trying to get through here.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.640]  Can you move?
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.162]  Shame on you!
[00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.482]  I'm not even here for the event.
[00:52:13.482 --> 00:52:15.023]  Can you get out the way?
[00:52:15.023 --> 00:52:17.384]  I don't care.
[00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:18.545]  I hate everyone right now.
[00:52:19.622 --> 00:52:20.642]  Where's Jordan Peterson?
[00:52:20.642 --> 00:52:22.823]  I don't know where he is, but you're the closest person to me.
[00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:23.703]  Shame!
[00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:24.344]  Shame!
[00:52:24.344 --> 00:52:26.004]  She's like, I'm just trying to go to class.
[00:52:26.004 --> 00:52:28.265]  What's going on?
[00:52:28.265 --> 00:52:32.767]  You're not going to see this outside of Bernie Sanders' Jake Tapper interview.
[00:52:32.767 --> 00:52:41.070]  You're not going to see this outside of Sadiq Khan's interview, even though Sadiq Khan says terrorism is part and parcel to any major city.
[00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.490]  Well, not here.
[00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:43.630]  So maybe it's just you, Khan!
[00:52:46.749 --> 00:52:47.309]  Look at that!
[00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.969]  Look at that!
[00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:52.611]  You know, I just... I'm gonna try not to be mean here.
[00:52:52.611 --> 00:53:00.273]  I was probably mean enough yesterday.
[00:53:00.273 --> 00:53:01.533]  You know, where do you go from there?
[00:53:01.533 --> 00:53:03.013]  Where do you go... See, this is what I'm saying.
[00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:05.554]  We don't call for CNN to be shut down.
[00:53:05.554 --> 00:53:09.415]  We don't attack them with violence and lies.
[00:53:09.415 --> 00:53:14.236]  We just take what they say and we say, look at how much they're lying to you.
[00:53:14.236 --> 00:53:15.957]  Look at how much they deceive the public.
[00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:27.033]  And then they say, shut InfoWars down, flag their videos, attack them, censor them!
[00:53:27.033 --> 00:53:31.194]  You had Alex actually mention this story earlier, he alluded to it, he didn't get into it though.
[00:53:31.194 --> 00:53:36.195]  Denver Sheriff shields illegal hit-and-run suspect from ICE deportation.
[00:53:36.195 --> 00:53:41.356]  Now, the mayor of Oakland gets to aid and abet criminals, she gets away with it.
[00:53:43.015 --> 00:53:47.738]  You have a non-citizen shoot and kill Kate Steinle.
[00:53:47.738 --> 00:53:49.539]  He gets away with it.
[00:53:49.539 --> 00:54:02.788]  Now you have a hit-and-run suspect, a non-citizen, who is going to be free to walk the streets and get away with it and not get deported.
[00:54:02.788 --> 00:54:09.793]  So, this is what happens when you let
[00:54:10.922 --> 00:54:14.004]  Criminals run the city.
[00:54:14.004 --> 00:54:17.707]  I had actually a lot of people attack me saying, why are you so insensitive to the homeless, Owen?
[00:54:17.707 --> 00:54:20.349]  You were complaining about the homeless guy with his truck and everything.
[00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:22.791]  No, I'm not being insensitive to the homeless.
[00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:30.917]  I'm saying when you let that element of society run society, society is going to be turned into dregs.
[00:54:30.917 --> 00:54:32.258]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:54:32.258 --> 00:54:37.581]  When Libby Schaaf and non-citizens get away with crime,
[00:54:38.601 --> 00:54:43.182]  That the average American citizen can't get away with, this is how society becomes dregs.
[00:54:43.182 --> 00:54:45.463]  This is how you create a third world country.
[00:54:45.463 --> 00:54:48.364]  There is no justice.
[00:54:48.364 --> 00:54:54.506]  And I've got this whole stack of news, I might as well just go into it now.
[00:54:54.506 --> 00:54:59.347]  California leaders rebuke Sessions as going to war over state immigration policy.
[00:54:59.347 --> 00:55:02.689]  Now apparently Sessions has said no, California can't succeed.
[00:55:02.689 --> 00:55:03.649]  I say let him succeed!
[00:55:04.835 --> 00:55:12.141]  I say give us New California instead of creating the 51st state of New California and then having the old California.
[00:55:12.141 --> 00:55:23.871]  Just let California succeed and then we'll take New California and then the old California will turn into a third world nation and we'll yet again have a case study of why communism fails every time.
[00:55:23.871 --> 00:55:27.434]  But they're fighting back and I want to use his exact language here.
[00:55:27.434 --> 00:55:30.117]  Governor Jerry Brown in response to Jeff Sessions
[00:55:31.178 --> 00:55:37.680]  Yesterday says Sessions is initiating a reign of terror against immigrants in California.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.121]  Now do you understand how big of a liar Governor Jerry Brown is?
[00:55:41.121 --> 00:55:46.563]  Do you understand how big of a phony Governor Jerry Brown is?
[00:55:46.563 --> 00:55:50.805]  Initiating a reign of terror against immigrants is so wrong, it's not even funny.
[00:55:50.805 --> 00:55:51.385]  First of all,
[00:55:52.105 --> 00:55:55.848]  They want to crack down on illegal immigration.
[00:55:55.848 --> 00:55:58.229]  So again, let's use the correct terminology.
[00:55:58.229 --> 00:56:08.276]  But then for Governor Jerry Brown to say he's initiating a reign of terror, how about the reign of terror you, Jerry Brown, have initiated on the citizens of California with sanctuary cities?
[00:56:08.276 --> 00:56:16.122]  How about the reign of terror you, Jerry Brown, have initiated on the state of California with open border policies and with
[00:56:16.622 --> 00:56:22.423]  Liberal welfare policies that have made California and parts of California look like a third-world country.
[00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:28.924]  How about you, Jerry Brown, take some of the responsibility for the terror that you have initiated on California?
[00:56:28.924 --> 00:56:30.425]  That's you, Jerry Brown!
[00:56:30.425 --> 00:56:37.586]  Feces-covered streets, needle-ridden streets, drug-ridden streets, poverty-ridden streets, homeless-ridden streets.
[00:56:37.586 --> 00:56:39.326]  That's on you, Jerry Brown!
[00:56:39.326 --> 00:56:40.326]  That's on you!
[00:56:40.326 --> 00:56:43.047]  That's not on Jeff Sessions, that's on you!
[00:56:45.503 --> 00:56:47.684]  But he'll blame Jeff Sessions.
[00:56:47.684 --> 00:56:57.168]  And now California, Trump is going to California next week to visit and address what's going on there with the sanctuary cities.
[00:56:57.168 --> 00:56:59.889]  So that's going to be explosive.
[00:56:59.889 --> 00:57:01.310]  Oh, this is the story though.
[00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.711]  See, this is what happens when you let criminals run the justice system.
[00:57:04.711 --> 00:57:09.013]  This is what happens when you let the dregs of society make the rules in society.
[00:57:09.867 --> 00:57:16.206]  Hartford police say man drove stolen car to court to face stolen car charge.
[00:57:17.978 --> 00:57:22.702]  Do you see how arrogant and wanton these criminals are becoming in this country?
[00:57:22.702 --> 00:57:29.188]  Do you see how empowered and entitled non-citizens and criminals are becoming in this country?
[00:57:29.188 --> 00:57:32.791]  And how American citizens are being shut down and silenced?
[00:57:32.791 --> 00:57:34.432]  That's because of the left!
[00:57:34.432 --> 00:57:36.134]  That's because of Democrats!
[00:57:36.134 --> 00:57:37.695]  That's because of liberals!
[00:57:37.695 --> 00:57:38.936]  That's what you get!
[00:57:38.936 --> 00:57:45.482]  You get a third world country and the hardworking people get shuffled off to the side to pay for the entire thing!

[00:58:51.143 --> 00:58:51.703]  Good, brother.
[00:58:51.703 --> 00:58:53.665]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:58:53.665 --> 00:58:55.366]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:58:55.366 --> 00:58:59.429]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:58:59.429 --> 00:59:02.032]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:59:02.032 --> 00:59:04.454]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:59:04.454 --> 00:59:12.420]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[00:59:29.855 --> 00:59:31.877]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.517 --> 01:00:03.358]  We're all living in America!
[01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:04.839]  America!
[01:00:04.839 --> 01:00:07.219]  It's wunderbar!
[01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:10.280]  We're all living in America!
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:19.423]  So California is basically collapsing, and Jerry Brown wants to blame Jeff Sessions, who simply asks that California follow the law.
[01:00:19.423 --> 01:00:22.704]  I mean, you can't even make this stuff up.
[01:00:22.704 --> 01:00:24.045]  It's so mad.
[01:00:24.045 --> 01:00:25.125]  It's so insane.
[01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:27.166]  I can't even believe I have to report on it.
[01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:32.947]  What is this Twilight Zone going on in California?
[01:00:32.947 --> 01:00:35.270]  Well... I mean, it just gets worse!
[01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:40.356]  I mean, look at this!
[01:00:40.356 --> 01:00:45.101]  Recycled water from sewers approved for California taps.
[01:00:45.101 --> 01:00:48.926]  Once a mecca for healthiness, California continues downward spiral.
[01:00:50.376 --> 01:01:01.249]  No, see, when pseudo-intellectuals and fake liberals run your state, run your town, they run it directly into the ground because they're all pseudo.
[01:01:01.249 --> 01:01:01.829]  They're fake.
[01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:02.490]  They're phonies.
[01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:03.151]  They're woozies.
[01:01:03.151 --> 01:01:04.713]  They're wazzies.
[01:01:04.713 --> 01:01:05.354]  They're nothing.
[01:01:09.993 --> 01:01:11.754]  I just don't get it.
[01:01:11.754 --> 01:01:24.561]  Why can't people look at California, look at what's happening in California, look at who runs California, and realize those policies don't work?
[01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:32.005]  Why are people so stupid?
[01:01:32.005 --> 01:01:34.226]  Now this is interesting.
[01:01:34.226 --> 01:01:36.728]  Let me propose a scenario for you.
[01:01:37.947 --> 01:01:40.948]  We've all heard about what's happening in South Africa.
[01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:48.732]  If you're white in South Africa, you're facing genocide, you're losing your property, and they're basically saying they're coming to kill you.
[01:01:48.732 --> 01:01:49.933]  Now think about this.
[01:01:49.933 --> 01:01:52.414]  Let me propose a scenario for you.
[01:01:52.414 --> 01:02:01.678]  Let's just say it reaches that point in South Africa where whites are just... I mean, it's already happening, honestly.
[01:02:01.678 --> 01:02:02.879]  Whites are already being genocided.
[01:02:02.879 --> 01:02:07.081]  But let's say it goes just full-on slaughter of white people.
[01:02:08.534 --> 01:02:10.936]  And that's what it's on the verge of.
[01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:25.529]  And then let's say, so now you've got 10,000 or more white refugees in South Africa trying to get out.
[01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:31.794]  Do we start bringing in white refugees from South Africa who are facing genocide in New America?
[01:02:31.794 --> 01:02:33.716]  Do we look at that scenario?
[01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:36.338]  And let's say, let's just say,
[01:02:38.561 --> 01:02:51.125]  President Trump comes out or someone from the Trump administration comes out and says, we're going to be taking in X amount of refugees from South Africa because they're facing genocide.
[01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:52.225]  You know what's going to happen.
[01:02:52.225 --> 01:02:56.027]  The left is going to freak out.
[01:02:56.027 --> 01:02:57.647]  Trump wants to take white people in.
[01:02:57.647 --> 01:02:58.948]  Trump only wants white people.
[01:02:58.948 --> 01:03:02.369]  Trump hates Muslims, but he wants the white people.
[01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:02.729]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:04.738 --> 01:03:14.586]  Can you imagine what the liberals would say if anyone from the Trump administration suggested bringing in white South Africans who are facing genocide, bringing them in as refugees?
[01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:18.889]  Oh, by the way, these are farmers, so they could actually come here.
[01:03:18.889 --> 01:03:21.431]  A lot of them probably may even speak English.
[01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:26.735]  So they could come here and immediately integrate into our society, farm,
[01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:31.350]  Create jobs.
[01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:32.451]  It would actually work.
[01:03:32.451 --> 01:03:33.952]  It would actually make sense.
[01:03:33.952 --> 01:03:46.440]  Instead of bringing in a bunch of people from the Middle East who don't speak the language, don't care about the culture, in fact, hate the culture, totally don't fit in with our society, don't fit in with our civilization.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:52.743]  Instead of bringing all of them in, with no vetting by the way, where we're bombing all the countries.
[01:03:52.743 --> 01:03:53.784]  That makes sense.
[01:03:53.784 --> 01:03:55.985]  That's what the liberals want.
[01:03:55.985 --> 01:03:56.546]  But you know,
[01:03:57.873 --> 01:04:00.314]  You just, you know it.
[01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:09.459]  If Trump or anyone from the Trump administration suggested bringing in white South Africans facing genocide as refugees, the liberals would freak out and they would call it racist.
[01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:23.466]  Even though it would actually make sense to bring people in that can actually contribute to society, farm the land, create jobs, speak the language, want to be here, want to be free, are facing genocide.
[01:04:25.655 --> 01:04:31.249]  I think that that is almost a genius move that the Trump administration should do.
[01:04:32.955 --> 01:04:42.578]  Whether or not you actually end up taking in white refugees from South Africa, all you have to do is float the idea out there just for the liberals to take the bait.
[01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:50.440]  Imagine the liberal media for 24 hours after Trump or someone from the Trump administration suggests taking white refugees from South Africa.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.921]  Imagine the Democrats the next 24 hours.
[01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:55.542]  Folks, that is a... I'm telling you, that's a brilliant move.
[01:04:55.542 --> 01:04:56.102]  Trump should do it.
[01:04:58.484 --> 01:05:03.885]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at m4store.com.
[01:05:03.885 --> 01:05:06.746]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:05:06.746 --> 01:05:08.727]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:05:08.727 --> 01:05:13.748]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:05:13.748 --> 01:05:15.828]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.129]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:05:17.129 --> 01:05:22.250]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:25.591]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:26.251]  We're good to go.
[01:05:53.348 --> 01:05:55.189]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:05:55.189 --> 01:06:11.575]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:28.035 --> 01:06:40.338]  Why is it that certain politicians and non-citizens can get away with crime that an average US citizen could not get away with?
[01:06:40.338 --> 01:06:43.339]  You have to ask yourself, why is that?
[01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:44.539]  Who benefits from that?
[01:06:44.539 --> 01:06:47.260]  Who funds that?
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:52.441]  Then you look at the ACLU, you look at the Democrat Party, you look at Democrat appointed judges,
[01:06:53.806 --> 01:06:56.269]  And then you understand the big picture.
[01:06:56.269 --> 01:07:00.054]  Then you understand what's actually going on here.
[01:07:00.054 --> 01:07:09.786]  Criminals bringing in more criminals to distract from their own criminal behavior and to get votes.
[01:07:09.786 --> 01:07:09.906]  Now,
[01:07:11.036 --> 01:07:13.759]  Alex alluded to this earlier as he's in Colorado.
[01:07:13.759 --> 01:07:16.261]  The story is at Infowars.com.
[01:07:16.261 --> 01:07:19.784]  Denver Sheriff shields illegal hit-and-run suspect from ICE deportation.
[01:07:19.784 --> 01:07:26.450]  Now, if you or I was guilty of hit-and-run, we would face the full extent of the law.
[01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:27.671]  We would face full justice.
[01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:31.214]  But if you're a non-citizen, you only get half justice.
[01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:34.217]  Here's the report from the local Fox affiliate in Denver.
[01:07:35.632 --> 01:07:42.278]  This cell phone video captures the fiery aftermath of a deadly hit-and-run crash at I-70 and I-25.
[01:07:42.278 --> 01:07:46.641]  Just an illegal immigrant just burning things in the street.
[01:07:46.641 --> 01:07:52.046]  Ivan Zamarripa Castaneda slammed into a semi-truck, killing the driver.
[01:07:52.046 --> 01:07:57.150]  Police say he took off from the scene, but officers later arrested him.
[01:07:57.150 --> 01:08:02.835]  Yesterday, ICE officers discovered that suspect is in the United States illegally.
[01:08:03.195 --> 01:08:05.195]  Oh, how do you know that?
[01:08:05.195 --> 01:08:06.116]  Shocking.
[01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:07.496]  How is that possible?
[01:08:07.496 --> 01:08:08.576]  He's not a citizen.
[01:08:08.576 --> 01:08:11.057]  How dumb is the Denver Sheriff's Department?
[01:08:11.057 --> 01:08:11.197]  Wow.
[01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:37.807]  So now you've got liberals in Denver, liberals in California standing up for non-citizens before they stand up for veterans, before they stand up for American citizens.
[01:08:58.983 --> 01:09:01.344]  That's what you get.
[01:09:01.344 --> 01:09:06.947]  A truck on fire after a non-citizen crashed into it and killed the driver.
[01:09:06.947 --> 01:09:13.250]  But no, thanks to the ACLU and liberal judges, a non-citizen, guilty of probably manslaughter at least, has a Fourth Amendment right?
[01:09:28.496 --> 01:09:29.977]  What's next?
[01:09:29.977 --> 01:09:31.417]  Does he have a Second Amendment right, too?
[01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:38.640]  Oh, I guarantee you they'll say he has a Second Amendment right, but the white NRA member doesn't.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:53.725]  The white NRA member needs to turn in his guns, but the illegal that just ran over a guy, killed him, and then fled the scene, he somehow has a Second Amendment right, a Fourth Amendment right, every right under the sun, thanks to the ACLU, Democrats, and liberal judges.
[01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:58.951]  Do you see the mental illness that we're dealing with here?
[01:09:58.951 --> 01:10:04.096]  And you just have to wonder, I mean, are these people wantonly just totally hate America?
[01:10:04.096 --> 01:10:06.738]  I mean, do these people want to see America destroyed?
[01:10:06.738 --> 01:10:08.039]  Are they that stupid?
[01:10:08.039 --> 01:10:08.640]  What is the deal?
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.281]  Are they that big of criminals?
[01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:12.023]  What is going on here?
[01:10:12.023 --> 01:10:15.626]  How does the ACLU still operate?
[01:10:15.626 --> 01:10:22.132]  The American Civil Liberties Union, the most un-American team of lawyers you could ever imagine,
[01:10:25.307 --> 01:10:26.028]  So that's great.
[01:10:26.028 --> 01:10:29.191]  Gosh, I love reporting on that.
[01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.372]  It's infuriating.
[01:10:30.372 --> 01:10:35.397]  So now, here's Kamala Harris, though.
[01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:35.878]  You know what?
[01:10:35.878 --> 01:10:37.880]  I don't know how much longer I can deal with these people.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.184]  I'm starting to just... Kamala Harris now.
[01:10:42.184 --> 01:10:42.585]  You know what?
[01:10:42.585 --> 01:10:43.025]  Just play.
[01:10:43.025 --> 01:10:43.786]  This woman is sick.
[01:10:43.786 --> 01:10:44.246]  Just play it.
[01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:57.463]  Attorney General Sessions compared California's actions, quite intentionally I think, to the actions of the slave states in nullification and secession during the Civil War.
[01:10:57.463 --> 01:10:58.805]  What do you say to that?
[01:10:58.805 --> 01:11:00.347]  Indeed, indeed he did.
[01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:19.642]  Listen, as far as I'm concerned, Jeff Sessions should be advised, and I'll advise him right now, that it's a bad idea for him to start talking about anything to do with the history of slavery or Reconstruction or the Civil War in the United States.
[01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:20.323]  How dare he?
[01:11:20.323 --> 01:11:23.105]  He's not allowed to.
[01:11:23.105 --> 01:11:24.126]  He has no credibility.
[01:11:24.126 --> 01:11:24.827]  I'm Kamala Harris.
[01:11:25.747 --> 01:11:29.410]  Um, I think Jerry Brown is absolutely right.
[01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.092]  This administration and Jeff Sessions... See, now pause right here.
[01:11:32.092 --> 01:11:32.653]  Now pause right here.
[01:11:32.653 --> 01:11:33.333]  See, see, see?
[01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:36.476]  Look, look.
[01:11:36.476 --> 01:11:37.957]  I'm sorry I'm struggling with this, folks.
[01:11:37.957 --> 01:11:39.338]  It's just, these people...
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.703]  Liars and phonies like Kamala Harris and Jerry Brown.
[01:11:44.703 --> 01:11:52.411]  The fact that they institute policy and they're lawmakers in this country, I mean, it really, it crushes me.
[01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:58.998]  It's like a kick to the groin that these phony, anti-American scumbags run my country!
[01:11:58.998 --> 01:12:01.020]  Look at what they've done to California!
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.262]  And then here's Kamala Harris like,
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.081]  I think Jerry Brown's done a great job!
[01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:09.801]  I love the fact that illegal citizens run this country!
[01:12:09.801 --> 01:12:10.882]  I love this state!
[01:12:10.882 --> 01:12:13.642]  I love the fact that the homeless population runs this state!
[01:12:13.642 --> 01:12:15.383]  I love the fact we're totally in debt!
[01:12:15.383 --> 01:12:17.563]  I love the fact there's feces in the streets!
[01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:19.304]  I love the state of California!
[01:12:19.304 --> 01:12:21.464]  Governor Jerry Brown's done a great job!
[01:12:21.464 --> 01:12:23.445]  And Jeff Sessions should just shut up!
[01:12:23.445 --> 01:12:31.327]  Even though Alabama seems to be doing just fine, without all the liberal policies, they don't have feces in the streets, and needles everywhere, and rampant homelessness!
[01:12:31.607 --> 01:12:33.248]  California's doing much better!
[01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:36.251]  I'm on Jerry Brown's team!
[01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:38.232]  We're gonna destroy the state of California together!
[01:12:38.232 --> 01:12:41.034]  And Jeff Sessions has no credibility!
[01:12:41.034 --> 01:12:42.035]  Woo!
[01:12:42.035 --> 01:12:46.318]  And then Kamala Harris wants to run for president!
[01:12:46.318 --> 01:12:49.200]  A total nit!
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.422]  A total nit!
[01:12:51.422 --> 01:12:53.904]  Kamala Harris thinks she can run for president.
[01:12:53.904 --> 01:12:56.826]  And that's what the Democrats have to offer.
[01:12:56.826 --> 01:12:57.527]  Let's go back.
[01:12:58.715 --> 01:13:04.977]  To Kamala Harris, who probably couldn't even read a map.
[01:13:04.977 --> 01:13:08.257]  They put a target on the back of California, and California's gonna fight.
[01:13:08.257 --> 01:13:09.818]  Pause it right there!
[01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:10.478]  Pause it right there!
[01:13:10.478 --> 01:13:15.319]  Pause it, pause it, pause it.
[01:13:15.319 --> 01:13:19.120]  I'm seriously struggling to report on this without just screaming and throwing things and breaking things.
[01:13:21.286 --> 01:13:25.450]  Jeff Sessions put a target on the back of California, folks.
[01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:26.251]  Jeff Sessions.
[01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:26.872]  Excuse me.
[01:13:26.872 --> 01:13:31.496]  Was it Jeff Sessions that was in power when you have piles of feces in the streets?
[01:13:31.496 --> 01:13:35.280]  Was it Jeff Sessions that enacted the clean needle policy?
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:35.620]  No.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:41.706]  Was it Jeff Sessions that instituted the sanctuary city policy that's led to nothing but crime and violence?
[01:13:41.706 --> 01:13:42.066]  No.
[01:13:42.066 --> 01:13:43.267]  Was it Jeff Sessions
[01:13:43.928 --> 01:13:50.844]  That was the mayor of Oakland that aided and abetted criminals, at least 800 of them, to get away with crime.
[01:13:50.844 --> 01:13:52.007]  Was that Jeff Sessions?
[01:13:52.007 --> 01:13:52.428]  No.
[01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.530]  Was it Jeff Sessions?
[01:13:54.707 --> 01:13:57.829]  That shot and killed Kate Steinle and then got away with it?
[01:13:57.829 --> 01:13:58.409]  Nope!
[01:13:58.409 --> 01:13:58.809]  Nope!
[01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:01.471]  Was it Jeff Sessions that was in charge of California?
[01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:09.536]  When a homeless population went through the roofs and now you have homeless tent cities all across the west coast of California?
[01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:10.857]  Was that Jeff Sessions?
[01:14:10.857 --> 01:14:11.457]  No!
[01:14:11.457 --> 01:14:12.818]  That was Jerry Brown!
[01:14:12.818 --> 01:14:14.219]  That was Kamala Harris!
[01:14:14.219 --> 01:14:15.739]  That was Maxine Waters!
[01:14:15.739 --> 01:14:17.240]  That was Nancy Pelosi!
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.901]  That was Dianne Feinstein!
[01:14:18.901 --> 01:14:20.282]  That was Adam Schiff!
[01:14:20.282 --> 01:14:21.623]  That was Eric Swalwell!
[01:14:21.883 --> 01:14:23.144]  That's who it was!
[01:14:23.144 --> 01:14:28.306]  And then Kamala Harris says Jeff Sessions has put a target on the back of California.
[01:14:28.306 --> 01:14:30.027]  Well, you know what, Kamala Harris?
[01:14:30.027 --> 01:14:37.691]  Maybe Jeff Sessions put a target on the back of California because it's become a third world hellhole and he wants to clean it up.
[01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:37.892]  You!
[01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:46.596]  You, Kamala Harris, have defecated with all your other Democrats and all your liberal judges and the ACLU all over California.
[01:14:46.596 --> 01:14:52.159]  So yes, Sessions put a target on the back of California because you made it a third-world hellhole!
[01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:55.760]  And he wants to clean it up, and here you are defending it!
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.841]  I want to stay a third-world hellhole!
[01:14:57.841 --> 01:15:03.244]  I want the streets of California to be riddled with violence and crime and drugs and poverty!
[01:15:03.244 --> 01:15:04.265]  That's what the Democrats do!
[01:15:05.265 --> 01:15:06.827]  Me in charge of the country!
[01:15:06.827 --> 01:15:09.051]  Go back to Kamala Harris before my head explodes.
[01:15:09.051 --> 01:15:10.212]  Actually, you know what?
[01:15:10.212 --> 01:15:10.393]  Don't.
[01:15:10.393 --> 01:15:11.014]  Just cut her off.
[01:15:11.014 --> 01:15:15.400]  Just cut her off.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:15.720]  Okay.
[01:15:17.401 --> 01:15:18.482]  Don't you just love it, folks?
[01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:19.582]  Don't you just love it?
[01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:26.887]  White people being genocided in Africa, the liberals say nothing, California turns into a third world hellhole, and the Democrats think it's great.
[01:15:26.887 --> 01:15:42.757]  Meanwhile, the New York Police Department is ready to arrest Harvey Weinstein, one of the big liberal Democrat donors, friends with the Obamas, friends with the Clintons, ran Hollywood, that tries to spout all of their liberal agenda down our throats.
[01:15:42.757 --> 01:15:45.238]  These people are the biggest frauds!
[01:15:45.238 --> 01:15:45.839]  You know what it is?
[01:15:46.599 --> 01:15:50.941]  This is why America loves Infowars, because we are done with frauds.
[01:15:50.941 --> 01:15:52.742]  We're done being run by frauds.
[01:15:52.742 --> 01:15:54.623]  We're done with the country being run by frauds.
[01:15:54.623 --> 01:15:55.683]  We're done with frauds in the media.
[01:15:55.683 --> 01:15:57.764]  I'm just done with all the frauds.
[01:15:57.764 --> 01:16:00.326]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banyan Hill.
[01:16:00.326 --> 01:16:01.506]  You like freedom?
[01:16:01.506 --> 01:16:02.227]  I do.
[01:16:02.227 --> 01:16:03.227]  You like money?
[01:16:03.227 --> 01:16:03.727]  I do too.
[01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:08.130]  If you like freedom and money, then you're gonna love Freedom Checks.
[01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:14.793]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[01:16:15.413 --> 01:16:16.433]  Yep, you heard that right.
[01:16:16.433 --> 01:16:19.254]  $34.6 billion.

[01:16:28.657 --> 01:16:32.458]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:36.699]  And if Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can, too.
[01:16:37.219 --> 01:16:38.380]  But here's the thing.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:46.650]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.

[01:16:58.722 --> 01:17:01.945]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[01:17:01.945 --> 01:17:03.546]  Savory and delicious.
[01:17:03.546 --> 01:17:06.387]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:17:06.387 --> 01:17:07.048]  Awesome.
[01:17:07.048 --> 01:17:10.150]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:12.331]  Bacon.

[01:17:16.494 --> 01:17:17.915]  Or warm and served.
[01:17:17.915 --> 01:17:19.957]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:17:19.957 --> 01:17:21.918]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[01:17:27.161 --> 01:17:28.382]  Hear that?
[01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:33.765]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:17:33.765 --> 01:17:36.666]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:40.248]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:17:40.248 --> 01:17:47.832]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[01:17:58.556 --> 01:18:05.633]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:18:05.633 --> 01:18:06.555]  You're a white man!

[01:18:41.278 --> 01:18:44.859]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[01:18:44.859 --> 01:18:47.780]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.061]  This is The War Room.
[01:18:58.897 --> 01:19:01.237]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.398]  We're really, really proud of it.

[01:19:28.422 --> 01:19:34.210]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:39.658]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[01:19:39.658 --> 01:19:41.921]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:19:41.921 --> 01:19:43.063]  Buy these!
[01:19:43.063 --> 01:19:43.944]  Sold out in a month!
[01:19:44.818 --> 01:19:45.538]  Here's a crazy notion.
[01:20:16.215 --> 01:20:21.520]  I want to live in the greatest, most prosperous country on earth with the highest standard of living.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:25.423]  Oh, here I am in the United States of America!
[01:20:25.423 --> 01:20:27.025]  Wow!
[01:20:27.025 --> 01:20:32.009]  But the Democrats and the Liberals are trying to destroy it all.
[01:20:32.009 --> 01:20:33.610]  Just look at California.
[01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:41.657]  And that's why I get so mad when I have to cover California and cover liars and phonies like Jerry Brown and Kamala Harris.
[01:20:43.337 --> 01:20:57.680]  Everywhere people like them go, they leave total destruction and annihilation of culture, of finance, of civilization, of infrastructure, and they want to run everywhere.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.401]  They're authoritarians and they're total failures.
[01:21:00.401 --> 01:21:03.042]  Their policies fail every time.
[01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:04.262]  But I'm going to try to
[01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:26.343]  Devolves from that so that I'm not screaming at the audience all day long because I know that that tends to be an issue For me when I cover this stuff, so let's let's switch tracks And I'm also gonna go to the audience here and open up the phone lines momentarily to maybe the audience can try to calm me down You're starting to hear more echoes in the
[01:21:27.355 --> 01:21:35.179]  D.C., in the Hill, in the White House, in the Senate, in the House, everywhere about a second special counsel.
[01:21:35.179 --> 01:21:41.663]  Trey Gowdy, Ron DeSantis, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz, Orrin Hatz, Chuck Grassley.
[01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:44.164]  And they're all suggesting we have to have a second counsel.
[01:21:44.164 --> 01:21:45.465]  We have to have a second counsel.
[01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:46.805]  We need more people interviewed.
[01:21:46.805 --> 01:21:48.266]  There's bias in this counsel.
[01:21:48.266 --> 01:21:49.667]  There's bias in the FBI.
[01:21:49.667 --> 01:21:51.568]  All we can do is have the second counsel.
[01:21:51.568 --> 01:21:53.429]  And they're all signaling to Jeff Sessions like,
[01:21:54.457 --> 01:21:56.098]  SESSIONS!
[01:21:56.098 --> 01:21:57.639]  SECOND COUNCIL!
[01:21:57.639 --> 01:21:58.679]  PLEASE!
[01:21:58.679 --> 01:22:01.001]  WHERE ARE YOU?
[01:22:01.001 --> 01:22:10.966]  Well, it looks like Sessions has pulled the potatoes out of his ears and is finally hearing them as he is apparently seriously considering it.
[01:22:10.966 --> 01:22:12.087]  Here's a report on Fox.
[01:22:13.749 --> 01:22:22.255]  Well, I have great respect for Mr. Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte, and we're going to consider seriously their recommendations.
[01:22:22.255 --> 01:22:34.263]  I have appointed a person outside of Washington many years in the Department of Justice to look at all the allegations that the House Judiciary Committee members sent to us, and we're conducting that investigation.
[01:22:34.263 --> 01:22:42.008]  I also am well aware that we have a responsibility to ensure the integrity of the FISA process.
[01:22:42.008 --> 01:22:43.549]  We're not afraid to look at that.
[01:22:44.029 --> 01:22:56.036]  The Inspector General, some think that our Inspector General is not very strong, but he has almost 500 employers, employees, most of which are lawyers and prosecutors.
[01:22:56.036 --> 01:22:57.116]  He just doubt his impartiality.
[01:22:57.116 --> 01:23:00.138]  And they're looking at the FISA process.
[01:23:00.138 --> 01:23:07.542]  We must make sure it's done properly, and we're going to do that, and I'll consider their request.
[01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:08.083]  All right then.
[01:23:08.982 --> 01:23:10.743]  Let's hope he's serious about that.
[01:23:10.743 --> 01:23:15.526]  And let's hope he's not just considering it, but is going to give us a second counsel.
[01:23:15.526 --> 01:23:25.111]  Because, as President Trump has said, the crimes and everything that's been going on with Hillary Clinton and the emails and Benghazi, it's unbelievable.
[01:23:25.111 --> 01:23:27.913]  And then the Obama-FISA scandal is bigger than Watergate.
[01:23:27.913 --> 01:23:31.315]  So, yeah, let's get something going, please, Jeff Sessions.
[01:23:31.315 --> 01:23:32.315]  We're begging you.
[01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:36.878]  We are begging you to do something about these criminals that have infiltrated our government
[01:23:37.418 --> 01:23:38.979]  And that are still walking free.
[01:23:38.979 --> 01:23:42.342]  Every day that Hillary Clinton walks free, I lose a little more patience.
[01:23:42.342 --> 01:23:52.569]  Now, just to show you, just to show you how out of touch with reality and warped the mind of an average liberal is, let me break this down for you.
[01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:52.809]  Okay.
[01:23:54.448 --> 01:23:58.709]  Now, I covered the collapse of Hollywood and the movie industry yesterday.
[01:23:58.709 --> 01:24:06.190]  There's many reasons for that, but you better believe that liberals in Hollywood have done it to themselves.
[01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:12.371]  Yes, Netflix is part of the reason why movie sales are down, but it's not the whole story.
[01:24:12.371 --> 01:24:18.892]  A lot of it has to do with liberals espousing their politics, and then people don't want to go pay to see them in the theater.
[01:24:18.892 --> 01:24:21.613]  Here's the most recent example.
[01:24:21.613 --> 01:24:22.553]  A Wrinkle in Time.
[01:24:24.456 --> 01:24:35.159]  Latest mega million dollar movie, huge cast, big advertising push, you see it everywhere, A Wrinkle in Time starring Oprah.
[01:24:35.159 --> 01:24:38.360]  Well, A Wrinkle in Time has totally flopped at the box office.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.561]  A total failure, a total bust, A Wrinkle in Time.
[01:24:42.561 --> 01:24:45.961]  Again, starring Oprah.
[01:24:45.961 --> 01:24:50.463]  A Wrinkle in Time starring Oprah fails in the box office.
[01:24:54.013 --> 01:24:57.195]  What is also happening at the same time?
[01:24:57.195 --> 01:25:01.218]  People are pushing Oprah to run for president.
[01:25:01.218 --> 01:25:03.479]  Do you see the disconnect here?
[01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:07.101]  Ladies and gentlemen, Oprah can't even sell a movie!
[01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:09.683]  She can't even sell a children's movie!
[01:25:09.683 --> 01:25:10.644]  You think she can win?
[01:25:12.443 --> 01:25:15.246]  A presidential election?
[01:25:15.246 --> 01:25:16.246]  Please!
[01:25:16.246 --> 01:25:19.449]  I beg you to nominate Oprah.
[01:25:19.449 --> 01:25:20.530]  Oprah doesn't have a chance.
[01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:24.153]  Now look, Oprah will get the dumbed-down liberal vote.
[01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:25.134]  Of course she will.
[01:25:25.134 --> 01:25:27.056]  She'll get all of the dumbed-down liberal votes.
[01:25:27.056 --> 01:25:27.977]  That's a given.
[01:25:27.977 --> 01:25:28.817]  That's fine.
[01:25:28.817 --> 01:25:34.442]  But most Americans aren't dumbed-down liberals.
[01:25:34.442 --> 01:25:36.564]  And I've got news for you, too.
[01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:39.467]  Most dumbed-down liberals don't even vote.
[01:25:41.352 --> 01:25:44.094]  So good luck with that strategy.
[01:25:44.094 --> 01:25:46.076]  But they're moving forward.
[01:25:46.076 --> 01:25:49.139]  CBS urges Oprah to run against Trump.
[01:25:49.139 --> 01:25:51.161]  You heal and connect all people.
[01:25:51.161 --> 01:25:57.747]  Again, a woman that can't even sell a movie they think can run for president.
[01:25:57.747 --> 01:26:02.772]  Here is CBS promoting or prompting Oprah to run for president.
[01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:10.872]  One of the things that, as we were saying before the break, is that there are a lot of people out there who would like to see you be president of the United States.
[01:26:10.872 --> 01:26:14.192]  This guy's their propaganda man.
[01:26:14.192 --> 01:26:18.554]  We're more than honored by that.
[01:26:18.554 --> 01:26:22.675]  It just isn't something... I've said this before.
[01:26:22.675 --> 01:26:23.555]  I would know it.
[01:26:23.555 --> 01:26:28.016]  I mean, it would be... You know, everybody's saying it.
[01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.637]  I am very much in touch with my inner...
[01:26:31.377 --> 01:26:32.098]  GPS?
[01:26:32.098 --> 01:26:33.298]  And let's pause right here for a second.
[01:26:33.298 --> 01:26:34.239]  Let's pause right here for a second.
[01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:36.440]  Let's give Oprah the respect that she's due.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.282]  I mean, this is a very successful woman, okay?
[01:26:39.282 --> 01:26:45.585]  I mean, she knows how to get rich, she knows how to build a business empire, even though her television network totally failed.
[01:26:45.585 --> 01:26:51.909]  Other than that, she's pretty much been a success, you know, as far as her business life is concerned, her whole life.
[01:26:51.909 --> 01:26:52.790]  So this is a woman
[01:26:53.806 --> 01:26:56.488]  Who wouldn't run for president unless she thought she's gonna win?
[01:26:56.488 --> 01:26:58.169]  I don't think Oprah's stupid.
[01:26:58.169 --> 01:27:01.911]  I think Oprah knows that she can't beat Trump, so she's not gonna run in 2020.
[01:27:01.911 --> 01:27:22.425]  Now, maybe she thinks she can beat someone in 2024, or maybe something down the road, but I think this is why Oprah kind of flirts with the idea and kind of plays patty cake with it, because she knows that she can't beat Trump, but she likes the notion and having it out there, and she's a smart businesswoman, it's good publicity, but I don't think she would ever put herself in a position to lose an election.
[01:27:22.425 --> 01:27:23.486]  That's why I don't think she'll run.
[01:27:24.767 --> 01:27:25.848]  Um, uh, you know what?
[01:27:25.848 --> 01:27:29.533]  Alright, go ahead and finish that clip.
[01:27:30.325 --> 01:27:30.725]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.725 --> 01:27:31.525]  The voice of God.
[01:27:31.525 --> 01:27:39.647]  In fact, you said in, again, People Magazine, if I have this quote right, you said, God, if you think I'm supposed to run, you gotta tell me.
[01:27:39.647 --> 01:27:40.927]  And it has to be so clear.
[01:27:40.927 --> 01:27:43.128]  So clear, even I. That not even I can miss it.
[01:27:43.128 --> 01:27:43.888]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:27:43.888 --> 01:27:44.628]  That's right.
[01:27:44.628 --> 01:27:47.429]  So, have you had any signs at all?
[01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:50.949]  Oh, but they make fun of Mike Pence when he says he speaks to God.
[01:27:50.949 --> 01:27:51.649]  He's the bad guy.
[01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:53.750]  But Oprah, it's okay for her to invoke God.
[01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:55.812]  You know that those are all people outside you.
[01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:56.633]  You know what that is.
[01:27:56.633 --> 01:28:00.437]  If a thousand people tell you to do something but you don't feel it inside yourself.
[01:28:00.437 --> 01:28:02.219]  If a thousand people say... You mean you know you can't win?
[01:28:07.038 --> 01:28:07.679]  You know, it doesn't.
[01:28:07.679 --> 01:28:09.640]  So, no, I haven't.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.982]  Okay, well, I guess that settles it.
[01:28:12.982 --> 01:28:16.785]  Oprah, Stephen, what's up?
[01:28:16.785 --> 01:28:18.125]  Hey!
[01:28:18.125 --> 01:28:24.169]  Okay, so now CBS projects the image of God on top of the studio to invoke Oprah to run for president.
[01:28:24.169 --> 01:28:24.770]  Look at this.
[01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:26.231]  I apologize.
[01:28:26.231 --> 01:28:26.911]  I apologize.
[01:28:26.911 --> 01:28:28.472]  God stops by every once in a while.
[01:28:28.472 --> 01:28:29.473]  He's a fan.
[01:28:29.473 --> 01:28:30.894]  Can I help you, Lord?
[01:28:30.894 --> 01:28:33.595]  I'm kind of in the middle of talking to somebody important.
[01:28:33.595 --> 01:28:34.556]  Oh, I know, Stephen.
[01:28:34.556 --> 01:28:35.777]  I'm a huge fan!
[01:28:37.757 --> 01:28:38.598]  That's great to hear.
[01:28:38.598 --> 01:28:40.200]  I'm a big fan of yours too, God.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:40.780]  I really am.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:43.223]  Oh, but Mike Pence is crazy when he talks about God.
[01:28:43.223 --> 01:28:45.405]  Trump is crazy when he talks about God.
[01:28:45.405 --> 01:28:54.494]  Here's CBS literally invoking God, putting an image of God, a projection of God on the studio while Colbert is interviewing Oprah to get her to run for president.
[01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:55.755]  These people have lost their minds.
[01:28:55.755 --> 01:28:56.376]  They've lost their minds.
[01:28:57.492 --> 01:28:58.373]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.373 --> 01:29:00.794]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:08.920]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.861]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[01:32:00.045 --> 01:32:00.345]  Go ahead.
[01:32:01.278 --> 01:32:03.199]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:32:03.199 --> 01:32:13.704]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:32:13.704 --> 01:32:20.167]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.528]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:32:23.269 --> 01:32:23.729]  Thank you.
[01:32:23.729 --> 01:32:24.049]  Absolutely.
[01:32:40.286 --> 01:33:02.038]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:02.038 --> 01:33:04.700]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.079 --> 01:33:20.141]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:36.610]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:39.232]  Well, here's the story, folks.
[01:33:39.232 --> 01:33:42.834]  We are under constant censorship, constant attack.
[01:33:44.199 --> 01:34:00.575]  And the liberal media is behind a lot of it, whether it's the Southern Poverty Law Center, or Mother Jones, or even CNN, constantly trying to demonize us, dehumanize us, attack us, lie about us, and then have us shut down.
[01:34:02.878 --> 01:34:11.686]  Because Alex Jones created an independent platform here and made the InfoWars store, we can remain independent.
[01:34:11.686 --> 01:34:18.793]  So even if they try to shut us down and silence us, thanks to you, we can still operate and remain independent.
[01:34:18.793 --> 01:34:21.315]  And your support at InfoWarsStore.com makes that possible.
[01:34:21.315 --> 01:34:23.677]  So we've got huge specials running right now.
[01:34:25.145 --> 01:34:31.096]  This is actually week two of these specials, so I doubt that these get extended into week three.
[01:34:31.096 --> 01:34:35.884]  So take advantage of all the specials right now at InfoWarStore.com before they come to an end.
[01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:50.373]  I would guess by Sunday, sometimes Alex tends to just let these things run on and just kind of let them go off the rails before he shuts them down just because he wants you to try the products out at a great price.
[01:34:50.373 --> 01:34:53.673]  But my guess is this probably can't last much past Sunday.
[01:34:53.673 --> 01:34:59.455]  So I would make sure to get to the InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of these specials, including free shipping store-wide.
[01:34:59.455 --> 01:35:02.915]  Free shipping store-wide.
[01:35:02.915 --> 01:35:05.436]  Now, for big ticket items like emergency food,
[01:35:06.116 --> 01:35:06.617]  We're good.
[01:35:23.891 --> 01:35:28.115]  The household items are what make it so easy for you to shop with us.
[01:35:28.115 --> 01:35:29.937]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:35:29.937 --> 01:35:32.860]  Everyone uses toothpaste.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:36.484]  So, why not shop with the good guys at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:35:36.484 --> 01:35:40.628]  There's also a special running on Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste right now.
[01:35:42.150 --> 01:35:54.257]  Toothpaste is special because it does not have the toxic fluoride in it, and instead has the good nascent iodine in there, as well as colloidal silver.
[01:35:54.257 --> 01:36:05.944]  And you can go read the thousands and thousands of reviews for yourself, almost all five-star reviews, 4.8-star review average, and that's almost 3,500 reviews, might even be more than that.
[01:36:06.764 --> 01:36:08.766]  And you can just read the reviews for yourself, folks.
[01:36:08.766 --> 01:36:09.587]  Give it a try.
[01:36:09.587 --> 01:36:12.850]  It's on sale right now at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:37.832]  Huge specials right now.

[01:36:39.413 --> 01:36:42.956]  Help us expand and defeat the fake news.
[01:36:42.956 --> 01:36:45.337]  That's why CNN wants us shut down.
[01:36:45.337 --> 01:36:47.699]  That's why News Corp wants us shut down.
[01:36:47.699 --> 01:36:48.940]  Because we're defeating them.
[01:36:50.069 --> 01:36:54.596]  They can't survive with us as competition, so they have to shut us down.
[01:36:54.596 --> 01:36:56.238]  That's a Nazi technique.
[01:36:56.238 --> 01:37:02.127]  So help InfoWars defeat the Nazis at CNN by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:02.127 --> 01:37:02.407]  Alright.
[01:37:06.053 --> 01:37:16.495]  I've gotten a little angry here today having to cover the liberal nonsense in California, so I'm going to give out the phone line now, and we'll let the audience kind of talk me back off the ledge here.
[01:37:16.495 --> 01:37:17.296]  The phone number is 1-877-789-2539.
[01:37:17.296 --> 01:37:17.476]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:37:17.476 --> 01:37:21.216]  Now, specifically with Brad Parscale, guys, let's actually try to screen some of these calls today.
[01:37:21.216 --> 01:37:22.217]  Because I want to talk about
[01:37:34.995 --> 01:37:43.600]  Really, this as the biggest story, but what do we do?
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.923]  I guess here's what I want to hear from the audience today.
[01:37:47.923 --> 01:37:52.826]  What do we do about the bias, the censorship,
[01:37:54.281 --> 01:38:04.690]  The Nazi-style rollout of their quote-unquote public forum, that's not really public, it's totally biased, totally slanted, at Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[01:38:04.690 --> 01:38:05.611]  What do we do?
[01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:07.292]  What should the Trump administration do?
[01:38:07.292 --> 01:38:12.036]  What do you think Brad Parscale is warning when he says we're watching you?
[01:38:12.036 --> 01:38:13.477]  What do you think the answer to this is?
[01:38:14.349 --> 01:38:17.171]  That's one topic you can call in today on.
[01:38:17.171 --> 01:38:20.433]  Brad Parscale's tweets warning big tech.
[01:38:20.433 --> 01:38:21.733]  What do you think about that?
[01:38:21.733 --> 01:38:22.674]  What do we do about that?
[01:38:22.674 --> 01:38:23.694]  What do we do moving forward?
[01:38:23.694 --> 01:38:26.436]  So that's one topic, guys, when screening these calls.
[01:38:26.436 --> 01:38:41.565]  The other topic, you've got, and I'm gonna go to this clip, because of the tariffs, and I've heard arguments both ways, I'm not gonna act like the expert, I'm gonna say I'm willing to give Trump a chance on this and see if he can deliver.
[01:38:42.748 --> 01:38:44.510]  And it does appear he's already delivering.
[01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:54.259]  Now we'll see what happens if a quote-unquote trade war happens, but you have had steel plants reopening, aluminum plants reopening.
[01:38:54.259 --> 01:38:58.743]  I've had callers call into the war room that I normally host with Roger Stone from 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:38:58.743 --> 01:39:00.304]  at Infowars.com slash show.
[01:39:01.559 --> 01:39:06.982]  I've had callers call in from Pennsylvania saying, yeah, we are now opening the steel plants again.
[01:39:06.982 --> 01:39:08.243]  We're now back to work.
[01:39:08.243 --> 01:39:14.687]  I actually, I had a guy call in and say, I used to work full-time, overtime, and then I got slashed to nothing during the Obama years.
[01:39:14.687 --> 01:39:15.848]  Now I'm back working overtime.
[01:39:15.848 --> 01:39:16.709]  We're hiring more people.
[01:39:18.066 --> 01:39:20.687]  The two subjects I want to take calls on today.
[01:39:20.687 --> 01:39:25.790]  What do you take from Brad Parscale's tweet warning big tech about censorship?
[01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:29.272]  And then two, are you a steel worker?
[01:39:29.272 --> 01:39:31.153]  Are you a steel worker in Ohio?
[01:39:31.153 --> 01:39:33.354]  Are you a steel worker in Pennsylvania?
[01:39:33.354 --> 01:39:35.335]  Have you worked in the steel plants before?
[01:39:35.335 --> 01:39:37.296]  Have you seen the steel plants get shut down?
[01:39:37.296 --> 01:39:38.777]  Now are you seeing them come back?
[01:39:38.777 --> 01:39:45.341]  So I want to hear specifically from people in steel country, from people that manufacture steel and aluminum.
[01:39:46.281 --> 01:39:47.242]  What do you think about this?
[01:39:47.242 --> 01:39:50.105]  Are you seeing the rejuvenation of American manufacturing?
[01:39:50.105 --> 01:39:52.467]  Are you seeing the steel industry coming back?
[01:39:52.467 --> 01:39:55.870]  Those are the two topics specifically I want to hear about today.
[01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:59.393]  So either someone working in steel country with experience in the steel country...
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:06.262]  Or, what do you think about Brad Parscale's tweet and what do we do about the censorship from Big Tech?
[01:40:06.262 --> 01:40:09.624]  Guys, those are the two subjects I want today.
[01:40:09.624 --> 01:40:11.544]  So we're going to kind of be screening your calls.
[01:40:11.544 --> 01:40:13.185]  I want to only talk about those two things.
[01:40:13.185 --> 01:40:15.526]  Now, we're aggregating your calls right now.
[01:40:15.526 --> 01:40:17.267]  Again, the Wall Street Journal.
[01:40:17.267 --> 01:40:22.189]  Some steel and aluminum makers to restart plant operation amid tariff plans.
[01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.589]  Boom!
[01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:24.269]  Rejuvenating American manufacturing.
[01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:27.551]  Adon Salazar, Infowars.com.
[01:40:27.551 --> 01:40:28.051]  Trump Effect.
[01:40:28.471 --> 01:40:28.751]  U.S.
[01:40:28.751 --> 01:40:32.475]  Steel reopens plant, brings back 500 jobs.
[01:40:32.475 --> 01:40:34.737]  And here is the CEO of U.S.
[01:40:34.737 --> 01:40:37.940]  Steel on CNBC crediting Trump with their reopening.
[01:40:40.225 --> 01:40:49.208]  We're really excited to be able to tell our employees in the community in Granite City, Illinois that we will be calling back 500 employees.
[01:40:49.208 --> 01:40:52.069]  This feels like the beginning of a renaissance for us.
[01:40:52.069 --> 01:41:01.073]  We're finally doing the right thing for American workers after decades, decades of unfairly traded steel into the United States.
[01:41:01.073 --> 01:41:07.575]  So we're really happy and delighted to share with everybody that we're getting back on track after so many years.
[01:41:07.975 --> 01:41:12.939]  Mr. Burrett, the Granite City facilities had been idled since December of 2015.
[01:41:12.939 --> 01:41:13.600]  What happened?
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.401]  What caused the idling?
[01:41:15.401 --> 01:41:16.623]  Well, it's the unfair trade.
[01:41:16.623 --> 01:41:23.408]  You know, if you're not, if you don't have customers here to sell to and you can't make money, you have to shut them down.
[01:41:23.408 --> 01:41:29.634]  And we've seen our facilities go from 15 facilities here in the most recent years down to 7.
[01:41:29.634 --> 01:41:31.575]  That's what Obama did.
[01:41:31.575 --> 01:41:34.438]  That was stopping the American manufacturing industry.
[01:41:34.438 --> 01:41:35.419]  Stopping American
[01:41:35.919 --> 01:41:46.084]  We actually have a value of a billion dollars, a market capitalization of a billion dollars, and in January of 2016, we're actually less than a billion dollars.
[01:41:46.084 --> 01:41:55.688]  And here we are, working hard every day, trying to get the things back on track, and we finally get some good news because we got some courageous leadership in the administration.
[01:41:55.688 --> 01:42:03.272]  And big, big thanks to Commerce Secretary Ross and certainly President Trump for taking the leadership and righting some wrongs.
[01:42:03.752 --> 01:42:07.776]  It's really important that we get this right and finally it's happening.
[01:42:07.776 --> 01:42:08.876]  One more very quick question.
[01:42:08.876 --> 01:42:17.704]  What we've heard in the pushback from people on the opposite side of this issue this week has been that, look, the jobs aren't going to come back regardless.
[01:42:17.704 --> 01:42:18.965]  That so much has been automated.
[01:42:18.965 --> 01:42:20.466]  Oh, but they are coming back.
[01:42:20.466 --> 01:42:23.309]  In the steel industry and in the aluminum industry.
[01:42:23.309 --> 01:42:23.929]  What do you say to that?
[01:42:23.929 --> 01:42:26.391]  Nothing can replace American grit and American hard work.
[01:42:26.391 --> 01:42:27.652]  All right, we got to go to a break here.
[01:42:27.652 --> 01:42:29.474]  On the other side, we'll start taking your calls.
[01:42:29.474 --> 01:42:31.496]  But folks, this is Trump fulfilling his promise.
[01:42:32.475 --> 01:42:45.758]  This is Trump bringing back American manufacturing, rejuvenating American manufacturing, making us more reliant and independent, or less reliant on other steel, more independent and reliant on our own manufactured goods.
[01:42:45.758 --> 01:42:49.599]  And they always spin, oh it'll never work, there's no magic jobs wand.
[01:42:49.599 --> 01:42:54.240]  And then Trump just delivers, stock markets up, American manufacturing back, steel plants back.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.020]  Your calls on the other side, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:57.807 --> 01:43:00.829]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:43:00.829 --> 01:43:05.033]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:43:05.033 --> 01:43:11.738]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:43:11.738 --> 01:43:15.501]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:43:16.201 --> 01:43:35.718]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:43:36.258 --> 01:43:40.380]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:51.607]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:43:51.607 --> 01:43:56.710]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:01.632]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:44:01.632 --> 01:44:09.716]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:44:09.716 --> 01:44:15.018]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:44:15.018 --> 01:44:17.539]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:17.539 --> 01:44:21.761]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:21.761 --> 01:44:24.202]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:44:24.895 --> 01:44:32.117]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:44:32.117 --> 01:44:39.300]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:47.362]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:44:47.362 --> 01:44:48.823]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:44:48.823 --> 01:44:51.463]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:44:51.463 --> 01:44:54.944]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:44:54.944 --> 01:44:56.665]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:58.266 --> 01:45:01.669]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:05.632]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:08.975]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.975 --> 01:45:11.517]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.517 --> 01:45:16.261]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:45:16.261 --> 01:45:18.603]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:45:18.603 --> 01:45:24.989]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:33.797]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.797 --> 01:45:38.861]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.861 --> 01:45:45.847]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.628 --> 01:45:52.496]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science,
[01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:09.194]  We are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[01:46:09.194 --> 01:46:16.699]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[01:46:16.699 --> 01:46:27.066]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[01:46:27.066 --> 01:46:32.109]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[01:46:32.109 --> 01:46:32.990]  But all of these
[01:46:33.810 --> 01:46:42.377]  ...are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[01:46:42.377 --> 01:46:48.242]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:46:48.242 --> 01:46:57.269]  When you purchase it at m4wrestore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:10.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.962 --> 01:47:24.026]  Alright, we're about to go to your phone calls here before I'm joined by Leanne McAdoo in the third hour.
[01:47:24.026 --> 01:47:28.127]  Before I do though, I'm going to be taking your calls on Brad Parscale's tweets,
[01:47:29.781 --> 01:47:32.584]  Or his tweet warning Big Tech.
[01:47:32.584 --> 01:47:34.466]  Again, I mentioned this last segment.
[01:47:34.466 --> 01:47:38.209]  Jeff Sessions seriously considering second special counsel.
[01:47:38.209 --> 01:47:42.854]  Hey Jeff, stop seriously considering it and do it.
[01:47:42.854 --> 01:47:44.075]  I'm giving you credit this week.
[01:47:44.075 --> 01:47:44.976]  You've been alive.
[01:47:44.976 --> 01:47:46.537]  You have a pulse.
[01:47:46.537 --> 01:47:49.340]  You've woken from your comatose.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:52.003]  Now let's start moving forward with some of this.
[01:47:52.003 --> 01:47:54.165]  Get the special counsel, the second one.
[01:47:55.791 --> 01:48:01.740]  And let's start jailing some of these politicians that are breaking the law, like Libby Schaaf.
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:03.743]  Alright.
[01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:06.507]  Real quick.
[01:48:06.507 --> 01:48:09.411]  This is just wild, and I suspect
[01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:22.550]  The Fox Newses of the world will be all over this tonight, so we'll let this kind of stew, and we'll see what comes of it, but you probably heard about the poisoned Russian spy.
[01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:29.614]  Well, it turns out, Sergei Skripal, I don't know if I'm saying that right, Russia, Putin, am I saying that right?
[01:48:29.614 --> 01:48:32.755]  Putin, how do I say that?
[01:48:32.755 --> 01:48:35.097]  Putin?
[01:48:35.097 --> 01:48:36.097]  Putin?
[01:48:36.097 --> 01:48:37.518]  Guys, I've been abandoned by Putin here.
[01:48:39.676 --> 01:48:40.397]  Thank you, Putin.
[01:48:40.397 --> 01:48:45.863]  Sergey Skripal was close to a consultant who was linked to the Trump dossier.
[01:48:45.863 --> 01:48:48.126]  Now, how do we know that?
[01:48:48.126 --> 01:48:57.736]  Because as far as I know, Christopher Steele has not given the identity of his Russian sources.
[01:48:57.736 --> 01:48:59.879]  So Christopher Steele colluded with Russia
[01:49:01.488 --> 01:49:04.111]  To make up the fake narrative that Trump colluded with Russia.
[01:49:04.111 --> 01:49:08.135]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up unless you're in the Twilight Zone.
[01:49:08.135 --> 01:49:13.640]  And now you've got this poisoned spy, this Russian spy, Sergei Skripal.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.804]  And I'm sitting here and I'm like, how do we know he wasn't one of the sources?
[01:49:17.804 --> 01:49:21.327]  How do we know this man wasn't one of the sources for the Trump dossier?
[01:49:21.327 --> 01:49:25.652]  And like all these other Russians right now, just totally trolled the United States media.
[01:49:27.403 --> 01:49:29.904]  It's like Russians have the greatest sense of humor right now.
[01:49:29.904 --> 01:49:31.885]  It's like everything is just a joke to them.
[01:49:31.885 --> 01:49:32.446]  Like U.S.
[01:49:32.446 --> 01:49:34.246]  media is such a joke to them.
[01:49:34.246 --> 01:49:34.547]  U.S.
[01:49:34.547 --> 01:49:35.947]  politics is such a joke to them.
[01:49:35.947 --> 01:49:42.070]  They just call up politicians and prank call them.
[01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:45.232]  But this Russian spy gets poisoned.
[01:49:45.232 --> 01:49:51.155]  How do I know he wasn't one of the consultants directly Christopher Steele went to?
[01:49:51.155 --> 01:49:53.476]  Maybe they had to rub him out.
[01:49:56.869 --> 01:50:03.352]  Seth Rich style to try to hide their crimes once again.
[01:50:03.352 --> 01:50:12.037]  So I have a feeling that that's going to stew and something more is going to come of that, but I'll just leave that out there for you to chew on.
[01:50:12.037 --> 01:50:15.539]  Let's go out to the phone lines now.
[01:50:15.539 --> 01:50:18.420]  Where should we go first?
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:23.223]  Let's go to Corey calling in from Pennsylvania, a truck driver in steel country.
[01:50:23.223 --> 01:50:25.064]  Go ahead, Corey.
[01:50:25.064 --> 01:50:25.904]  Hey, how you doing today?
[01:50:26.667 --> 01:50:27.147]  Doing good.
[01:50:27.147 --> 01:50:33.189]  What have you seen differently since Trump has become president out there in steel country?
[01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:36.890]  Well, not only now that the steel industry is coming back... Hey, you know what, Corey?
[01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:39.931]  Corey, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but are you on a speakerphone or something?
[01:50:39.931 --> 01:50:40.652]  Can you get off that?
[01:50:40.652 --> 01:50:42.452]  We're having trouble hearing you.
[01:50:42.452 --> 01:50:46.393]  Yeah, give me one second.
[01:50:46.393 --> 01:50:48.774]  This is great national talk radio here.
[01:50:48.774 --> 01:50:50.175]  Hey, sorry about that, my friend.
[01:50:50.175 --> 01:50:50.755]  Alright, go ahead.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:51:05.063]  So what I've been seeing is not only just in the industrial side, but on the retail and manufacturing side as well for the freight rates across the board have been increasing under the current administration.
[01:51:05.063 --> 01:51:10.644]  So it's not just the steel industry in general, but the whole trucking industry as well is coming up.
[01:51:10.644 --> 01:51:12.524]  It's been down for a little while.
[01:51:12.524 --> 01:51:15.225]  There's a huge shortage of drivers, but it's not just drivers.
[01:51:15.225 --> 01:51:16.605]  It's also the pay side.
[01:51:16.605 --> 01:51:19.826]  So pay is starting to come up and the qualified drivers are making more money.
[01:51:21.147 --> 01:51:36.074]  So you're saying, your experience as a truck driver, you're saying you've seen, in that industry, wages going up, more work opportunities being made available, and more American manufacturing being shipped using the trucking industry?
[01:51:36.074 --> 01:51:38.075]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:51:38.075 --> 01:51:45.259]  Well, I'm here in the heart of the Northeast, so we're just been non-stop busy and getting better, so.
[01:51:45.259 --> 01:51:46.540]  I'm not complaining, that's for sure.
[01:51:47.631 --> 01:51:57.676]  And wouldn't you say, I mean, I would say that based on what we've seen so far, Trump should have Ohio and Pennsylvania locked up for 2020.
[01:51:57.676 --> 01:51:58.356]  I would hope so.
[01:51:58.356 --> 01:52:02.378]  I was very happy with the win there during the election process.
[01:52:02.378 --> 01:52:04.840]  It was a little nerve-wracking the last few hours.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:09.542]  But we saw record turnout just in my little town.
[01:52:09.542 --> 01:52:13.364]  Kind of like 3,000 people and two-thirds of the town actually counted.
[01:52:14.974 --> 01:52:28.517]  Well, I think it's only going to get better, and the more jobs return, the more manufacturing returns, I think more people are going to come over to Trump, because more people are going to benefit from the industry, from the job market expanding, from the pay wages going up.
[01:52:28.517 --> 01:52:30.298]  Thank you for the call, Corey.
[01:52:30.298 --> 01:52:33.819]  Let's now jump over to Michael in Michigan.
[01:52:33.819 --> 01:52:39.440]  He wants to talk about the solution to Twitter and Facebook basically censoring conservatives.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.621]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:42.061]  Hey, Owen.
[01:52:44.656 --> 01:52:47.378]  Taking my call.
[01:52:47.378 --> 01:52:50.300]  So what's on your mind?
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:53:07.570]  My solution to the Twitter, Facebook interference is, back when I was a kid, when the President spoke, all the TV stations had nothing but the President speaking.
[01:53:07.570 --> 01:53:10.352]  Everything was shut down, it was nothing but the President speaking.
[01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:11.812]  They should do that today.
[01:53:11.812 --> 01:53:28.147]  We have the emergency broadcast system that the president can take over and when he has news to put out to the people, not just the conservatives, but if he was able to use the emergency broadcasting system on the radio and TV, his message would get out to everyone.
[01:53:29.361 --> 01:53:30.842]  I think I understand what you're saying.
[01:53:30.842 --> 01:53:49.327]  Well, I do understand what you're saying, but are you saying he needs to do this like all the time or maybe just hit it once where he just goes in and goes over all the broadcast networks and is just like, hey, look, there's serious censorship going on on these platforms that you need to be aware of to just force it out into, you know, the mainstream.
[01:53:50.697 --> 01:53:52.498]  Yeah, once a month.
[01:53:52.498 --> 01:53:54.719]  That's all that would be needed.
[01:53:54.719 --> 01:54:03.042]  And that's kind of what he does with his Twitter account, but you're saying take it one step further and basically kind of just force it out there.
[01:54:03.042 --> 01:54:04.763]  Force it out there, yeah.
[01:54:04.763 --> 01:54:15.587]  And another thing, when Trump's renegotiating his NAFTA, he needs to keep Canadian trash in Canada instead of littering all of Michigan with it.
[01:54:15.587 --> 01:54:17.768]  Canada keeps none of their trash.
[01:54:17.768 --> 01:54:18.929]  We take it all in Michigan.
[01:54:20.546 --> 01:54:23.707]  What do you guys have, like big incinerators or something up there?
[01:54:23.707 --> 01:54:26.308]  No, they use our lands, all our landfills.
[01:54:26.308 --> 01:54:33.832]  Canada has all the land possible up there, and we take all their trash.
[01:54:33.832 --> 01:54:35.072]  Interesting.
[01:54:35.072 --> 01:54:35.432]  Interesting.
[01:54:35.432 --> 01:54:39.374]  That sounds like a local issue, I'm not too aware of that, but an interesting issue to bring up.
[01:54:39.374 --> 01:54:41.115]  Thank you for the call, Michael.
[01:54:41.115 --> 01:54:45.077]  Speaking of Canada, let's go to Jeff, calling from Vancouver Island.
[01:54:45.077 --> 01:54:47.297]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:54:47.297 --> 01:54:48.378]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[01:54:50.362 --> 01:55:19.142]  I just want to say, the topic I called in on was righteous economics and I think, you know, Trump has got so many plates spinning with so many different issues that I think, you know, the perspective from the North, I think you guys really have to trust that he is doing the right thing and, you know, I was just thinking of Alex taking a week off with his family, you know, economically it might not make sense but, you know, for the health of his family it makes sense.
[01:55:19.810 --> 01:55:46.052]  I have to trust that Trump does see the big picture, he's got so many people working on that, and that just let time prove that this is right, because I think he's got a righteous stance on the country, I think he's got a team of people that pray for him, that's really encouraging to see, and just know that it's going to bear fruit
[01:55:46.925 --> 01:55:52.237]  And it seems like every time he does something that looks a bit off, it always seems to come around.
[01:55:52.237 --> 01:55:54.081]  So I just want to put that out.
[01:55:54.878 --> 01:56:00.260]  Well, and to me, I'm not an expert on tariffs or the steel industry or anything like that.
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:04.101]  I go based off what I see, what I read.
[01:56:04.101 --> 01:56:07.642]  And there's pretty much experts on both sides of the aisle with this issue.
[01:56:07.642 --> 01:56:09.463]  Some saying, yes, these tariffs will benefit.
[01:56:09.463 --> 01:56:11.424]  Others saying, no, these tariffs are bad.
[01:56:11.424 --> 01:56:15.345]  So I'm just sitting here neutral in the middle saying, look, I trust Trump's instincts.
[01:56:15.345 --> 01:56:18.086]  I think that he wants to do what's best for this country.
[01:56:18.086 --> 01:56:20.347]  So I'm willing to see what happens.
[01:56:21.067 --> 01:56:21.768]  We're good to go.
[01:56:38.402 --> 01:56:39.442]  Is America first?
[01:56:39.442 --> 01:56:45.743]  I mean, keeping American businesses here, keeping American manufacturing here, keeping the wealth and the prosperity here.
[01:56:45.743 --> 01:56:50.484]  And that, I think, is what's driving this policy and these tariffs.
[01:56:50.484 --> 01:56:51.924]  So again, we'll have to see what happens.
[01:56:51.924 --> 01:56:56.425]  But I'm just more on the side of I trust Trump.
[01:56:56.425 --> 01:56:57.265]  I'm not an expert.
[01:56:57.265 --> 01:56:59.486]  I see experts on both sides of the aisle.
[01:56:59.486 --> 01:57:01.486]  So I just want to wait and see what it bears out.
[01:57:01.486 --> 01:57:04.027]  Thank you for the call, Jeff, in Vancouver.
[01:57:04.027 --> 01:57:05.967]  So that's what you've got going on right now.
[01:57:07.308 --> 01:57:10.790]  And again, the two subjects we're taking your calls on.
[01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:13.192]  What do we do about big tech censoring?
[01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:18.735]  And what do you think about Brad Parscale's tweet from the Trump administration, the head of his campaign?
[01:57:18.735 --> 01:57:21.357]  Hey Facebook, Twitter, Google, we are watching.
[01:57:21.357 --> 01:57:24.139]  This is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is...
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:31.686]  I wonder if you put the word final opportunity in there, if it would also lend credence to what Parscale is thinking.
[01:57:31.686 --> 01:57:34.428]  And then also, are you in steel country?
[01:57:34.428 --> 01:57:35.609]  Are you a steel worker?
[01:57:35.609 --> 01:57:37.291]  Are you working in the manufacturing plants?
[01:57:37.291 --> 01:57:40.154]  What are you seeing right now with the tariffs?
[01:57:40.154 --> 01:57:41.555]  Is manufacturing coming back?
[01:57:41.555 --> 01:57:42.576]  Is steel coming back?
[01:57:42.576 --> 01:57:44.258]  We're going to be joined by Leanne McAdoo.
[01:57:44.258 --> 01:57:45.499]  More of your phone calls on the other side.
[01:57:45.499 --> 01:57:46.400]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:57:47.455 --> 01:57:58.043]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:58.043 --> 01:58:00.105]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:58:00.105 --> 01:58:02.967]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.967 --> 01:58:04.468]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.468 --> 01:58:07.591]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.691 --> 01:58:11.274]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.274 --> 01:58:13.355]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.355 --> 01:58:23.063]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:23.063 --> 01:58:35.392]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,

[01:58:39.877 --> 01:58:43.181]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:08.524]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:00:08.524 --> 02:00:10.865]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:00:10.865 --> 02:00:19.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.849 --> 02:00:24.452]  You know, there's this... I don't even know how to explain it.
[02:00:24.452 --> 02:00:25.933]  Most people wouldn't expect
[02:00:27.099 --> 02:00:41.251]  President Trump and his campaign staff to be so advanced on social media, where they do things that millennial social media expert users do.
[02:00:41.251 --> 02:00:46.915]  Where Brad Parscale tweets this out today, Hey Facebook, Twitter, Google, we are watching.
[02:00:46.915 --> 02:00:53.761]  This is your, my words, final opportunity to make sure the playing field is level.
[02:00:53.761 --> 02:00:54.782]  Hashtag mega.
[02:00:57.267 --> 02:01:09.318]  Now guys, if you would go to President Trump's Twitter and pull up, I think it was like his third or fourth tweet ago, where he says, we are going to do something about stolen intellectual property.
[02:01:09.318 --> 02:01:11.059]  But he doesn't really talk about who.
[02:01:11.059 --> 02:01:17.485]  Brad Parscale doesn't really get into what he means by, this is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is level.
[02:01:17.485 --> 02:01:19.707]  We're kind of just left to assume what that means.
[02:01:19.707 --> 02:01:20.748]  Let me explain to you what this is.
[02:01:21.536 --> 02:01:27.146]  This is what millennials and Twitter users call a sub-tweet.
[02:01:27.146 --> 02:01:28.588]  You know what a sub-tweet is, Leigh-Anne?
[02:01:28.588 --> 02:01:29.490]  Yes, I do.
[02:01:29.490 --> 02:01:31.333]  Well, a sub-tweet... Yeah, there it is.
[02:01:31.333 --> 02:01:33.817]  A sub-tweet is when you put a tweet out there...
[02:01:35.285 --> 02:01:37.626]  But there's actually a bit of nuance to it.
[02:01:37.626 --> 02:01:42.827]  There's a message, there's a hidden message underlining the actual tweet.
[02:01:42.827 --> 02:01:44.867]  That's why it's called a subtweet.
[02:01:44.867 --> 02:01:48.788]  And President Trump pulled up that last tweet about intellectual property.
[02:01:48.788 --> 02:01:55.690]  That tweet is 100% a subtweet telling China to quit stealing our intellectual property.
[02:01:55.690 --> 02:01:57.970]  That has been an ongoing story in this country for a while.
[02:01:57.970 --> 02:02:01.611]  Chinese hackers infiltrating US businesses, stealing their intellectual property.
[02:02:02.111 --> 02:02:05.054]  And then Brad Parscale, hey Facebook, Twitter, Google, we are watching.
[02:02:05.054 --> 02:02:07.436]  This is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is level.
[02:02:07.436 --> 02:02:09.277]  I think there's a subtweet there.
[02:02:09.277 --> 02:02:11.919]  Some of the callers think they have an idea of what that means.
[02:02:11.919 --> 02:02:15.763]  But, I mean, Leanne, what do you take out of this before we go to calls in the next segment?
[02:02:15.763 --> 02:02:23.669]  What do you think about Trump's new campaign manager, the Trump administration, basically warning Facebook, Twitter, and Google, like, hey, we know what you're doing.
[02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:24.370]  You better stop.
[02:02:25.017 --> 02:02:27.018]  Right, I mean this is very important.
[02:02:27.018 --> 02:02:32.522]  We see them really cracking down obviously leading up into the 2018 elections and then beyond.
[02:02:32.522 --> 02:02:42.208]  And if they're allowed to get away with this and decide who has a voice in the public square, I mean this is going to be probably one of the biggest free speech issues of our time.
[02:02:42.208 --> 02:02:49.273]  This is huge and we have to decide now who's going to be in charge of the information that we are allowed to have access to.
[02:02:50.091 --> 02:02:54.554]  And Facebook, Twitter, and Google have gotten so big, they're essentially bigger than the government.
[02:02:54.554 --> 02:02:56.335]  I mean, they're essentially bigger than the government.
[02:02:56.335 --> 02:02:57.897]  A lot of them don't even pay taxes.
[02:02:57.897 --> 02:03:04.621]  The government needs Google's AI for the Department of Defense to help them with their drones.
[02:03:04.621 --> 02:03:07.023]  So, I mean, they're huge.
[02:03:07.023 --> 02:03:15.689]  Same with, you know, Amazon and how, you know, certain alphabet bureaucracies use Amazon Cloud and everything, and they give out, and then Amazon doesn't pay taxes.
[02:03:15.689 --> 02:03:17.631]  So there's a huge conflict of interest there.
[02:03:18.584 --> 02:03:25.329]  And it really makes you wonder, how do you break that conflict of interest and hold Twitter, Facebook, and Google accountable?
[02:03:25.329 --> 02:03:26.470]  Right.
[02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:28.771]  And I like this article out of Breitbart.
[02:03:28.771 --> 02:03:34.996]  I believe John Nolte is the author, and I like his writing style in general.
[02:03:34.996 --> 02:03:36.777]  He admits he's not a fan of Alex Jones.
[02:03:37.277 --> 02:03:40.358]  But, you know, he knows he employs some good people.
[02:03:40.358 --> 02:03:46.060]  But that doesn't mean that he wants to live in a country where an Alex Jones is not allowed to be a part of the public square.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:51.762]  He doesn't want to live in a country where certain people decide what's a conspiracy theory and what's the truth.
[02:03:51.762 --> 02:03:53.022]  And I agree with that.
[02:03:53.022 --> 02:03:57.684]  I mean, because as we've seen, a lot of these theories turn out to be facts.
[02:03:58.264 --> 02:04:11.836]  And it's only after being pushed for decades that people do find the truth, but we don't want to live in a world where people are not allowed to put theories out there and to question the official narrative.
[02:04:11.836 --> 02:04:17.661]  Yeah, if you go back and you listen to an Alex Jones Show from 10 years ago, you'd think you were listening to something predicting the future.
[02:04:17.661 --> 02:04:18.141]  Right.
[02:04:18.141 --> 02:04:23.065]  But that's just because he was reporting on real news, he wasn't controlled like mainstream media was.
[02:04:24.284 --> 02:04:36.896]  And now that we have this pushback with the internet being open, new media coming and getting more audience, this is like their pushback to try to stop that because they can't control the narrative anymore and it freaks them out.
[02:04:36.896 --> 02:04:43.762]  But you would think, I mean with the craziness that goes on on the Alex Jones Show, I mean myself included, you would think they want that for content.
[02:04:44.042 --> 02:04:49.926]  Just like I want Don Lemon's idiotic comments and Rachel Madcow's idiotic comments so that I can respond.
[02:04:49.926 --> 02:04:53.768]  I don't like the fact they're liars and deceivers, but we don't call for them to be shut down.
[02:04:53.768 --> 02:04:54.529]  That's the difference.
[02:04:54.529 --> 02:04:54.729]  Right.
[02:04:57.205 --> 02:04:57.985]  I'm so excited.
[02:04:57.985 --> 02:05:08.129]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:08.129 --> 02:05:16.652]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:05:16.652 --> 02:05:25.415]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:37.784]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:05:37.784 --> 02:05:47.108]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:47.108 --> 02:05:49.789]  It is amazing!
[02:05:49.789 --> 02:05:54.751]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:06:00.658 --> 02:06:04.981]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:04.981 --> 02:06:07.803]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.803 --> 02:06:11.566]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones here.
[02:06:13.707 --> 02:06:15.388]  And I opened up the phone lines.
[02:06:15.388 --> 02:06:17.049]  Leanne McAdoo in studio with me here.
[02:06:17.049 --> 02:06:22.111]  We'll be taking your calls for the remainder of this hour, as well as hitting a spattering of news here.
[02:06:22.111 --> 02:06:27.153]  Leanne wants to talk about human organs being grown in pigs.
[02:06:27.153 --> 02:06:30.154]  They said that was a conspiracy theory when it was on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:30.154 --> 02:06:31.435]  Now it's mainstream news!
[02:06:31.435 --> 02:06:33.736]  So once again, tomorrow's news today.
[02:06:33.736 --> 02:06:35.677]  But we want to go out to the phone lines here.
[02:06:35.677 --> 02:06:42.320]  Again, the topics today were, what do you think of Brad Parscale's tweets warning Facebook, Twitter, and Google to stop censoring?
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.741]  And then, do you work in the steel industry?
[02:06:45.741 --> 02:06:46.802]  Do you live in steel country?
[02:06:46.802 --> 02:06:50.823]  What differences are you seeing since the tariffs have been talked about?
[02:06:50.823 --> 02:06:53.564]  And I believe they got enacted either today or yesterday.
[02:06:53.564 --> 02:06:57.246]  And we've got some callers calling in right now that work in the steel industry.
[02:06:57.246 --> 02:06:59.247]  Scott calling in from Indiana works at U.S.
[02:06:59.247 --> 02:06:59.527]  Steel.
[02:06:59.527 --> 02:07:00.887]  We heard from the CEO of U.S.
[02:07:00.887 --> 02:07:03.929]  Steel crediting Trump with delivering.
[02:07:03.929 --> 02:07:09.251]  Scott, what do you think about President Trump and the tariffs bringing steel manufacturing back to America?
[02:07:11.178 --> 02:07:11.959]  Good afternoon, Owen.
[02:07:11.959 --> 02:07:12.820]  How you doing?
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:15.683]  I appreciate what you guys are doing.
[02:07:15.683 --> 02:07:19.408]  You guys are standing up for everybody and you're the tip of the spear.
[02:07:19.408 --> 02:07:23.353]  Thank you guys, the whole crew, for what you do.
[02:07:23.353 --> 02:07:25.735]  Yeah, I think it's going to be a good thing.
[02:07:25.735 --> 02:07:27.658]  I think it's been long overdue.
[02:07:29.488 --> 02:07:31.610]  You know, things have been shutting down.
[02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:43.021]  Our sister plant in Granite City, Illinois, I've known people from that plant and it basically shut down that whole community when that plant went down.
[02:07:43.021 --> 02:07:45.423]  And I can tell you, I'm from St.
[02:07:45.423 --> 02:07:47.205]  Louis, Granite City is just on the other side of the river.
[02:07:47.805 --> 02:07:52.169]  A member of the crew here lived on the ill side, and we were actually talking about that one of the breaks.
[02:07:52.169 --> 02:07:56.312]  There used to be all types of manufacturing lining the Mississippi River in St.
[02:07:56.312 --> 02:08:00.916]  Louis, in Granite City, in Belleville, and it just got all shut down.
[02:08:00.916 --> 02:08:01.997]  It just disappeared.
[02:08:01.997 --> 02:08:08.402]  And you go down the Mississippi River, whether you're on the ill side or the most side, and there's just empty manufacturing plants everywhere.
[02:08:08.402 --> 02:08:10.083]  It's terrible.
[02:08:10.083 --> 02:08:16.328]  People don't understand the association of big steel in any community where a mill is located.
[02:08:16.986 --> 02:08:19.047]  You've got people that sell fasteners.
[02:08:19.047 --> 02:08:21.248]  You've got people that sell office supplies.
[02:08:21.248 --> 02:08:26.649]  You've got restaurants, diners that line that area.
[02:08:26.649 --> 02:08:27.950]  Supermarkets.
[02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:29.170]  It's all tied together.
[02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:34.232]  The steel mill supports so many other businesses in any community they're in.
[02:08:34.232 --> 02:08:41.915]  And when that steel mill is gone, it has a huge impact on any area economy, any small businesses.
[02:08:41.915 --> 02:08:42.935]  It's terrible.
[02:08:42.935 --> 02:08:44.916]  It's very terrible to see that happen.
[02:08:45.592 --> 02:08:48.873]  Well, and just think about it, guys, is that the one from Granite City?
[02:08:48.873 --> 02:08:49.693]  That you just pulled up there?
[02:08:49.693 --> 02:08:53.634]  All right, well, there's just an example of an empty steel mill.
[02:08:53.634 --> 02:09:00.575]  But just to echo what Scott is saying, you don't have to listen to Scott to know that he's telling the truth.
[02:09:00.575 --> 02:09:07.697]  All you have to do is go to the local, the biggest city by you, go to the inner city by you, whether it's St.
[02:09:07.697 --> 02:09:07.997]  Louis.
[02:09:08.357 --> 02:09:09.438]  Or Chicago.
[02:09:09.438 --> 02:09:10.739]  Or Baltimore.
[02:09:10.739 --> 02:09:14.001]  You have massive manufacturing plants shut down.
[02:09:14.001 --> 02:09:14.982]  Empty warehouses.
[02:09:14.982 --> 02:09:15.962]  Empty buildings.
[02:09:15.962 --> 02:09:17.183]  And then that's what Scott's talking about.
[02:09:17.183 --> 02:09:18.684]  That brings the poverty.
[02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:21.046]  That brings the lack of job opportunity.
[02:09:21.046 --> 02:09:22.547]  That brings the lack of growth.
[02:09:22.547 --> 02:09:23.988]  And then the homelessness.
[02:09:23.988 --> 02:09:26.109]  And then the rest of the degradation that comes with it.
[02:09:26.109 --> 02:09:26.269]  I mean...
[02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:32.711]  It's so weird, Leanne, that this is some sort of foreign concept that people see right in front of their face, right?
[02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:37.853]  They go downtown, they see the empty warehouses, they see the manufacturing shut down, but like it doesn't click.
[02:09:37.853 --> 02:09:39.213]  Why all of a sudden is there poverty here?
[02:09:39.213 --> 02:09:40.373]  Why is this being shut down?
[02:09:40.373 --> 02:09:44.934]  Right, why are entire cities that were once booming, they've just disappeared?
[02:09:44.934 --> 02:09:45.234]  Like Detroit.
[02:09:45.234 --> 02:09:46.315]  And everyone has to move away.
[02:09:46.315 --> 02:09:53.997]  And then they suggest, oh well, let's build up Detroit by bringing in refugees and recreating a new city with, you know, foreigners.
[02:09:53.997 --> 02:09:55.057]  But, I mean, it's just...
[02:09:56.017 --> 02:09:57.979]  We're seeing that all over the country.
[02:09:57.979 --> 02:09:59.580]  And now, Scott, you say you work at U.S.
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:00.020]  Steel.
[02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:02.161]  We heard from the CEO earlier.
[02:10:02.161 --> 02:10:06.084]  I mean, are you guys, as a company, I mean, is this, like, just huge for you?
[02:10:06.084 --> 02:10:08.886]  Just expansion, more job, more work?
[02:10:08.886 --> 02:10:12.968]  I mean, is this just like a celebration time for your industry right now?
[02:10:12.968 --> 02:10:16.771]  Well, what happened, us up here in northwest Indiana,
[02:10:17.273 --> 02:10:18.974]  We're kind of the flagship of the U.S.
[02:10:18.974 --> 02:10:20.595]  Steel Corporation.
[02:10:20.595 --> 02:10:26.899]  So when they started shutting down, you know, it's like you start shutting down things to keep the main body alive.
[02:10:26.899 --> 02:10:31.361]  We've been running pretty strong up here in Northwest Indiana.
[02:10:31.361 --> 02:10:33.282]  We really haven't missed a beat.
[02:10:33.282 --> 02:10:37.225]  But again, they were shutting down Granite City.
[02:10:37.225 --> 02:10:40.907]  They shut down our tubular plants in Lorain, Ohio.
[02:10:41.759 --> 02:10:45.701]  Uh, at Fairfield, Alabama, they shut down a blast furnace in Fairfield, Alabama.
[02:10:45.701 --> 02:10:47.322]  That one doesn't get the press.
[02:10:47.322 --> 02:10:49.543]  Fairfield is all but gone.
[02:10:49.543 --> 02:10:52.985]  Um, you had Texas Lone Star Tubular.
[02:10:52.985 --> 02:10:53.385]  Uh, U.S.
[02:10:53.385 --> 02:10:59.268]  Steel owns that, and since the gas prices are doing what they're doing, the tubular business is in the toilet.
[02:10:59.268 --> 02:11:09.553]  So, there's been a lot of other exterior facilities that have been shut down, but we've been running pretty strong here in Northwest Indiana, but they're gonna expect us to run even harder now.
[02:11:10.731 --> 02:11:12.391]  And that's the insight.
[02:11:12.391 --> 02:11:23.254]  That's such good insight, Scott, because, as you mentioned earlier, those manufacturing plants and those companies created cities.
[02:11:23.254 --> 02:11:26.094]  I mean, that's how American cities would come about.
[02:11:26.094 --> 02:11:33.996]  You create a business, you have a manufacturing plant, and then you hire people, and then they hire people, and then it gets bigger, and then you manufacture more.
[02:11:33.996 --> 02:11:36.536]  I mean, that used to be what built America.
[02:11:36.536 --> 02:11:39.057]  That was industrialism.
[02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:39.277]  Right.
[02:11:39.969 --> 02:11:48.172]  No, when we, here in Northwest Indiana, one time our plant, just this plant, employed 27,000 people.
[02:11:48.172 --> 02:11:51.153]  We are down to 4,000 people.
[02:11:51.153 --> 02:11:54.554]  Now do you expect that number to go back up now?
[02:11:54.554 --> 02:11:57.615]  Yes, they are in the process of hiring as we speak.
[02:11:58.564 --> 02:12:08.327]  Wow, so more jobs, more job opportunities, more work, and it looks like this is Trump delivering on bringing manufacturing, specifically in the steel industry, back to America.
[02:12:08.327 --> 02:12:09.967]  Thank you so much for the call, Scott.
[02:12:09.967 --> 02:12:11.308]  He mentioned Ohio.
[02:12:11.308 --> 02:12:13.668]  We now go out to Ohio, where Matt calls in.
[02:12:13.668 --> 02:12:15.849]  He also works at a steel mill.
[02:12:15.849 --> 02:12:18.390]  Go ahead, Matt.
[02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:19.870]  Hi, Owen.
[02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:21.551]  I also want to hit a quick plug.
[02:12:21.551 --> 02:12:22.771]  I take DNA force.
[02:12:22.771 --> 02:12:23.851]  I thank you guys for that.
[02:12:23.851 --> 02:12:24.872]  It's a great product.
[02:12:24.872 --> 02:12:25.452]  Works great.
[02:12:26.315 --> 02:12:27.656]  Hi Leanne.
[02:12:27.656 --> 02:12:31.657]  I actually did work in steel industry and steel country.
[02:12:31.657 --> 02:12:35.659]  My dad spent 16 years at Ormet Aluminum Plant.
[02:12:35.659 --> 02:12:44.583]  I was at Ormet with him and then went to Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel and a job that I thought I'd have for life, the tariffs, actually shut them down.
[02:12:44.583 --> 02:12:48.584]  And now since Trump's been in, that mill has opened back up.
[02:12:48.584 --> 02:12:49.865]  They might do more hiring.
[02:12:49.865 --> 02:12:52.326]  They're hoping to open the whole thing up now that the tariffs
[02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.678]  Actually started to go away.
[02:12:54.678 --> 02:12:59.800]  They're actually hoping to expand and a couple other industries up the Ohio River are starting to open up.
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:08.142]  So it sounds to me that the heads of these industries were shutting down and kind of rationing back because they didn't have that confidence in the future market.
[02:13:08.142 --> 02:13:11.743]  They didn't think that that business opportunity would be there in the future.
[02:13:11.743 --> 02:13:13.063]  Now they have that confidence.
[02:13:13.063 --> 02:13:14.763]  They see signs of it returning.
[02:13:14.763 --> 02:13:17.684]  So they're reopening and they're actually getting the jobs back.
[02:13:19.045 --> 02:13:24.670]  Yes, it's the same way with after the steel industry, I went underground in the coal mine and hoped to retire there.
[02:13:24.670 --> 02:13:29.494]  But Obama, of course, shut that down with the no, with the war on coal policy.
[02:13:29.494 --> 02:13:38.522]  But now that that's out, the coal industry now around here, because we border West Virginia, we're right across the river, the coal country and steel country in the same place.
[02:13:38.522 --> 02:13:43.085]  And they're both now just getting just booming because it shut the economy down.
[02:13:43.085 --> 02:13:45.808]  It shut the towns down that I lived in and grew up in.
[02:13:45.808 --> 02:13:47.189]  It's a completely different place.
[02:13:47.677 --> 02:13:57.968]  See, and that's what is so frustrating about this, Leanne, because the Democrats and liberals like Obama say, well, we have to shut this down, we have to kill coal and stop steel manufacturing because it kills the environment.
[02:13:57.968 --> 02:14:04.515]  They're not actually stopping it from being produced, it just goes overseas and all that wealth and prosperity goes somewhere else and then it destroys the American cities.
[02:14:04.515 --> 02:14:06.116]  I mean, doesn't that show how phony they are?
[02:14:06.116 --> 02:14:09.360]  They don't actually stop it from happening, they just stop America from benefiting.
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:13.263]  Right, and no plan as far as how to replace those jobs or what they were going to do.
[02:14:13.263 --> 02:14:20.509]  I mean, just listening to these callers, I can't help but feel just such tremendous relief.
[02:14:20.509 --> 02:14:27.095]  Can you imagine how close this country was to collapsing and people were just ready to kind of throw in the towel?
[02:14:27.095 --> 02:14:30.158]  We bought our home in New Zealand for the collapse.
[02:14:30.158 --> 02:14:31.199]  We'll be fine.
[02:14:31.199 --> 02:14:34.622]  The rest of you are going to have to fend for yourselves in your collapsing country.
[02:14:36.303 --> 02:14:39.726]  I mean, I know when I went to Flint, Michigan, that's what it looked like there, just a ghost town.
[02:14:39.726 --> 02:14:44.269]  And then you had your several, just a few families were holding on there.
[02:14:44.269 --> 02:14:49.753]  Maybe they couldn't afford to move out or, you know, that's where their generations of families had lived there, but a ghost town.
[02:14:49.753 --> 02:14:56.658]  And then you see pictures of the old downtown and the people are like in fur coats and, you know, just a booming, booming downtown.
[02:14:56.658 --> 02:15:00.321]  And then it turns into blight where they have to destroy the homes.
[02:15:00.461 --> 02:15:12.654]  And it was all independent, too, because they had their own manufacturing company, they had their own commerce, they had their own market there that they could always count on thriving, and it just gets shut down with all these government regulations.
[02:15:12.654 --> 02:15:14.696]  Matt, you've got 30 seconds left.
[02:15:14.696 --> 02:15:20.642]  Do you expect this trend of more steel jobs, more steel manufacturing to continue here in America?
[02:15:21.704 --> 02:15:22.345]  Yes, I do.
[02:15:22.345 --> 02:15:23.988]  I think it's going to prosper great.
[02:15:23.988 --> 02:15:25.250]  I'm thankful for Trump for that.
[02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:27.033]  And also, 30 seconds left, guys.
[02:15:27.033 --> 02:15:28.355]  Get the DNA products.
[02:15:28.355 --> 02:15:30.419]  Get everything from the Infowars store.
[02:15:30.419 --> 02:15:31.521]  It works, bud.
[02:15:31.521 --> 02:15:31.942]  It's great.
[02:15:32.884 --> 02:15:34.665]  All right, Matt, thank you so much for the call.
[02:15:34.665 --> 02:15:37.426]  And just to echo what he says, it definitely works.
[02:15:37.426 --> 02:15:39.447]  I use the products myself.
[02:15:39.447 --> 02:15:41.568]  I know that other members of the staff use them as well.

[02:16:26.599 --> 02:16:28.400]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.061]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:16:30.061 --> 02:16:32.882]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:16:32.882 --> 02:16:35.184]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:16:35.184 --> 02:16:39.686]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:16:55.285 --> 02:16:57.246]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:57.246 --> 02:17:02.548]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:02.548 --> 02:17:04.149]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:04.149 --> 02:17:12.493]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:12.493 --> 02:17:18.176]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:17:20.178 --> 02:17:22.339]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[02:17:56.478 --> 02:18:04.000]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:18:05.603 --> 02:18:16.434]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:18:16.434 --> 02:18:18.556]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[02:18:22.561 --> 02:18:23.582]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[02:18:34.829 --> 02:18:35.770]  That's my dad.
[02:18:35.770 --> 02:18:37.631]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[02:18:56.504 --> 02:19:04.489]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:04.489 --> 02:19:11.154]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:19:11.154 --> 02:19:19.420]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:25.563]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[02:19:25.563 --> 02:19:28.724]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:19:28.724 --> 02:19:34.807]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:19:34.807 --> 02:19:35.587]  It works.
[02:19:35.587 --> 02:19:44.031]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[02:19:44.031 --> 02:19:44.911]  Defender body armor.
[02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:46.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:12.384 --> 02:20:16.729]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:20:16.729 --> 02:20:21.395]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:21.395 --> 02:20:25.860]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:27.662]  Some of the other news today...
[02:20:28.905 --> 02:20:34.126]  Before we get back to your phone calls, 1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:20:34.126 --> 02:20:34.486]  1-877-789-2539.
[02:20:34.486 --> 02:20:39.608]  And we will go back to your phone calls here.
[02:20:39.608 --> 02:20:43.488]  Owen Troyer, Lee Ann McAdoo in studio here, filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:20:43.488 --> 02:20:49.890]  Federal court will hold first ever hearing on climate change science.
[02:20:49.890 --> 02:20:52.991]  Now this is set to be an absolute circus.
[02:20:52.991 --> 02:20:58.052]  You know that the left is going to have their protesters out there, but you wonder, will sanity
[02:20:59.161 --> 02:21:00.244]  Prevail.
[02:21:00.244 --> 02:21:03.091]  Because there is no science on man-made climate change.
[02:21:03.993 --> 02:21:13.677]  But this is going to be strange, because you know they're going to try to twist it and spin it and manipulate it and then say it's man-made, even though there's no science, there's just theories and formulas.
[02:21:13.677 --> 02:21:19.400]  And then they'll use real science that indicates climate change, not man-made, and then they'll say it's man-made.
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:22.141]  So that's going to be an absolute circus.
[02:21:22.141 --> 02:21:24.262]  I'm excited to stay tuned to that.
[02:21:24.262 --> 02:21:30.525]  FBI agent and estranged wife dead in apparent murder-suicide in Crownsville.
[02:21:30.525 --> 02:21:32.506]  I think that's just outside of Annapolis, Maryland.
[02:21:33.386 --> 02:21:43.533]  Um, Donna Fisher and FBI Special Agent David Raynor, um, both dead in an apparent murder-suicide.
[02:21:43.533 --> 02:21:45.495]  Um, so an interesting story there.
[02:21:45.495 --> 02:21:49.217]  Secret Service employee arrested on child porn charges.
[02:21:49.217 --> 02:21:50.899]  This also in Maryland.
[02:21:50.899 --> 02:21:54.301]  52-year-old, so all these guys are in their 50s.
[02:21:54.301 --> 02:21:55.962]  52-year-old Jeffrey Litterell.
[02:21:55.962 --> 02:21:57.363]  How about that?
[02:21:57.363 --> 02:21:57.704]  Litterell.
[02:21:58.664 --> 02:22:06.111]  Faces charges of possession of child pornography, distribution of child pornography, possession of obscene material, and distribution of obscene material.
[02:22:06.111 --> 02:22:09.474]  A secret service employee.
[02:22:09.474 --> 02:22:12.417]  Boy, that is something weird there.
[02:22:12.417 --> 02:22:14.399]  You always gotta wonder when that type of stuff happens.
[02:22:14.399 --> 02:22:21.785]  Yeah, like what secret service, who is he working for, and who was friends with him.
[02:22:21.785 --> 02:22:24.188]  Hope Hicks told House Intelligence Committee she was hacked.
[02:22:25.154 --> 02:22:32.441]  Yeah, I mean, this is kind of a duh type of a story, but again, it just tells you the deep state is up to things.
[02:22:32.441 --> 02:22:34.542]  I mean, look, Russia's up to things, too.
[02:22:34.542 --> 02:22:37.125]  I mean, I don't know who fished John Podesta.
[02:22:37.125 --> 02:22:37.745]  Was it Russians?
[02:22:37.745 --> 02:22:38.346]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:22:38.346 --> 02:22:39.827]  John Podesta's an idiot.
[02:22:39.827 --> 02:22:40.568]  He fell for it.
[02:22:40.568 --> 02:22:43.731]  He fell for Prince Abubu, you know, offering $10,000.
[02:22:43.731 --> 02:22:46.313]  And then, Leanne, actually, you want to talk about this.
[02:22:46.313 --> 02:22:47.354]  Why don't you read that story for us?
[02:22:47.754 --> 02:22:58.860]  Right, well this was a conspiracy theory, you know, maybe even just a year ago from Alex Jones that talking about using pigs for transplantation to humans.
[02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:11.928]  And this is scientists developing pigs for transplants and they kind of give this whole process for how they're going to remove the uterus from a pregnant pig just before delivery and disinfect it.
[02:23:12.668 --> 02:23:29.766]  Take the newborn piglets out of the uterus, raise with sterile artificial milk, raise the piglets for three weeks, conduct all sorts of tests, but then of course being able to transplant these pancreas, liver, kidneys, and any other organs into humans that might need them.
[02:23:31.067 --> 02:23:32.328]  I don't know what your take on this is.
[02:23:32.328 --> 02:23:34.089]  My take, honestly, I mean, I don't know.
[02:23:34.089 --> 02:23:35.750]  I'm kind of open-minded about it.
[02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:41.415]  If my life ends up getting saved by a pig liver, I mean, I guess I would support that.
[02:23:41.415 --> 02:23:43.876]  But is that what we're really supposed to be doing with science?
[02:23:43.876 --> 02:23:44.357]  I'm not sure.
[02:23:44.357 --> 02:23:48.219]  But again, the story to me is that they said that this was fake news.
[02:23:48.219 --> 02:23:51.462]  They said that Infowars were conspiracy theorists for reporting on this.
[02:23:51.462 --> 02:23:54.824]  But it's like, no, it's really happening, and it's not just pigs.
[02:23:54.824 --> 02:23:55.305]  And you know
[02:23:55.945 --> 02:24:00.047]  Just because they're telling you that this is going on now, this has been probably going on for decades.
[02:24:00.047 --> 02:24:01.187]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:24:01.187 --> 02:24:05.449]  So we've actually got a caller who the screeners let slip through.
[02:24:05.449 --> 02:24:07.749]  However, he was lucky because it is a topic.
[02:24:07.749 --> 02:24:08.090]  Shame!
[02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.750]  Shame!
[02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:09.610]  Shame!
[02:24:09.610 --> 02:24:11.351]  Shame!
[02:24:11.351 --> 02:24:12.851]  It is a topic that we want to discuss.
[02:24:12.851 --> 02:24:16.773]  So let's go out to Dan in Canada who wanted to talk about the human organs in pigs.
[02:24:16.773 --> 02:24:18.393]  Go ahead, Dan.
[02:24:18.393 --> 02:24:20.554]  Oh yeah, shame on me for that, right?
[02:24:20.554 --> 02:24:22.895]  Well, it's not shame on you, it's shame on the screeners.
[02:24:22.895 --> 02:24:24.175]  I did.
[02:24:24.175 --> 02:24:25.556]  How are you guys doing today?
[02:24:26.141 --> 02:24:27.782]  Doing good.
[02:24:27.782 --> 02:24:32.984]  Yeah, I've been doing a bit of research into this subject matter.
[02:24:32.984 --> 02:24:37.506]  I just find it weird, like, how do these people go about doing that?
[02:24:37.506 --> 02:24:41.128]  Do they go up to the farmers and say, hey, we need to do some tests on your pigs.
[02:24:41.128 --> 02:24:42.349]  Can we borrow one from you guys?
[02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:44.770]  Like, how is that like?
[02:24:44.770 --> 02:24:47.991]  They just go buy one from the farmer's market.
[02:24:47.991 --> 02:24:49.752]  Yeah, I mean, who knows what, I mean, come on, man.
[02:24:49.752 --> 02:24:52.614]  You know what kind of, who knows what goes on at CIA black sites.
[02:24:54.059 --> 02:25:03.584]  Yeah, like, I was born with only one kidney, so it's like, um, I'm not too sure if I'd really feel safe having, like, either, like, a pig or even with, like, a cow or some other animal.
[02:25:03.584 --> 02:25:07.026]  Like, uh, it's just, like you said, it's a very, like, uh, controversial thing and...
[02:25:09.357 --> 02:25:13.858]  It's a human-pig hybrid, which, you know, that's not real.
[02:25:13.858 --> 02:25:14.578]  That's fake news.
[02:25:14.578 --> 02:25:15.878]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:25:15.878 --> 02:25:25.720]  Japanese scientists have developed it, but... But you're saying, as somebody that may benefit from this science, it's even iffy for you?
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:36.142]  Oh, yes, Richard, because this goes back to, like, even... I know you guys don't really cover this much topic, but UFO stuff, when you hear about, like, cow mutilations and stuff, like, taking the organs out of that, that's like...
[02:25:37.577 --> 02:25:44.380]  That's some pretty crazy stuff that now that going from that theory to now humans are integrating animal organs with humans.
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:49.263]  Like how do we even know that stuff is even compatible with humans and vice versa?
[02:25:49.263 --> 02:25:52.964]  Well I assume that they've been testing this for a while and they're just now releasing it to the public.
[02:25:54.853 --> 02:25:59.554]  As far as UFOs obliterating cow organs, I don't know, Leigh-Anne, do you know anything about that?
[02:25:59.554 --> 02:26:00.574]  I do know, I've heard about that.
[02:26:00.574 --> 02:26:01.215]  I assume you did.
[02:26:01.215 --> 02:26:02.235]  Yes, of course.
[02:26:02.235 --> 02:26:11.697]  But, you know, it might help with organ harvesting and trafficking people for their organs, specifically to, you know, remove their organs.
[02:26:11.697 --> 02:26:18.599]  A lot of people fleeing Africa, for instance, they've been accused of trafficking for organ harvesting.
[02:26:18.599 --> 02:26:19.379]  Well, you know what?
[02:26:20.615 --> 02:26:25.999]  We don't need to go too deep into the rabbit hole, but yeah, organ harvesting is a big industry, no doubt, even on the black market.
[02:26:25.999 --> 02:26:28.201]  Anything else, Dan?
[02:26:28.201 --> 02:26:29.542]  Um, just going on and on.
[02:26:29.542 --> 02:26:33.825]  I've been hearing back even in the 90s with the Chinese and human cloning.
[02:26:33.825 --> 02:26:36.707]  I thought that was a bit of an interesting subject, too.
[02:26:36.707 --> 02:26:39.990]  I remember hearing about that earlier in the 90s.
[02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:41.571]  Yeah, now you've got, who is it?
[02:26:41.571 --> 02:26:43.453]  Who is it that just cloned their dog?
[02:26:43.453 --> 02:26:44.974]  Barbara Streisand.
[02:26:44.974 --> 02:26:46.515]  Was it Barbara Streisand that cloned her dog?
[02:26:46.515 --> 02:26:47.556]  Somebody cloned their dog.
[02:26:47.556 --> 02:26:50.518]  She has two dogs now out of her cloned dogs.
[02:26:51.212 --> 02:26:54.254]  And you can make dogs that, like, glow in the dark, too, or something?
[02:26:54.254 --> 02:26:55.695]  Yeah, who doesn't want that?
[02:26:55.695 --> 02:26:56.115]  Yeah.
[02:26:56.115 --> 02:26:56.676]  All right, Dan.
[02:26:56.676 --> 02:26:58.897]  Hey, thank you so much for the call.
[02:26:58.897 --> 02:27:06.963]  By the way, we are about to run out of time here in this segment, but we've got this story on InfoWars.com.
[02:27:06.963 --> 02:27:10.405]  Hollywood openly celebrates the triumph of the beta male.
[02:27:10.405 --> 02:27:11.706]  You know, it was actually funny, Leanne.
[02:27:11.706 --> 02:27:16.189]  I saw that this Hollywood Reporter cover, it went totally viral on social media yesterday.
[02:27:16.869 --> 02:27:22.339]  It's got four beta males on the cover and the cover title is Triumph of the Beta Male.
[02:27:22.339 --> 02:27:24.664]  And then look at this, they're all playing pocket pool with one another.
[02:27:24.664 --> 02:27:26.146]  What do you think about that, Leanne?
[02:27:27.116 --> 02:27:31.741]  Well, I mean, again, I want to point out, these are the Silicon Valley actors.
[02:27:31.741 --> 02:27:40.589]  Mike Judge, once again, he is like the great prophet of our time, predicting the rise of the beta male, so he makes a great show about it.
[02:27:40.589 --> 02:27:46.074]  And, you know, it's kind of a funny show, kind of making fun of that.
[02:27:46.074 --> 02:27:50.399]  But here, Hollywood, what is it, The Hollywood Reporter, they're like, yes!
[02:27:50.879 --> 02:27:51.980]  The triumph.
[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:55.583]  Really trying to sell it to us that this is what women want.
[02:27:55.583 --> 02:27:59.046]  It's like CNN and Buzzfeed and all these people run the story.
[02:27:59.046 --> 02:27:59.787]  Cuckolding.
[02:27:59.787 --> 02:28:01.568]  Cuckolding is the new trend.
[02:28:01.568 --> 02:28:03.450]  Yeah, cuckolding to save your marriage.
[02:28:03.450 --> 02:28:07.373]  It's okay if you call us a cuck.
[02:28:07.373 --> 02:28:10.036]  What is going on with these people?
[02:28:10.036 --> 02:28:12.658]  Hey, you know, they'll make excuses for anything.
[02:28:12.658 --> 02:28:13.378]  But here's the deal.
[02:28:14.299 --> 02:28:18.000]  Alex Jones responded to this, and we've got Alex Jones' report.
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:26.162]  We're actually going to air that later on in this hour, so you're definitely going to want to stay tuned to Alex Jones responding to the triumph of the beta male.
[02:28:26.162 --> 02:28:29.323]  That should be very, very interesting.
[02:28:29.323 --> 02:28:33.864]  Yeah, I mean, they've got to convince us it's a good thing that there's so much low testosterone in male infertility.
[02:28:34.724 --> 02:28:45.532]  It's just funny to me because, look, I don't want all these beta males being cucked by media, but at the same time, it kind of like, oh, well, I guess you just eliminated my competition.
[02:28:45.532 --> 02:28:46.913]  So, okay.
[02:28:46.913 --> 02:28:51.436]  Yeah, they aborted 33% of my generation, and then they turned the other half into cucks.
[02:28:51.436 --> 02:28:52.297]  So, way to go.
[02:28:55.936 --> 02:28:57.897]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:57.897 --> 02:29:03.218]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:29:03.218 --> 02:29:04.798]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:29:04.798 --> 02:29:13.160]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:18.842]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:19.022 --> 02:29:20.843]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:20.843 --> 02:29:23.025]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:23.025 --> 02:29:27.508]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:27.508 --> 02:29:29.709]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:29:46.578 --> 02:29:48.799]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:30:03.191 --> 02:30:03.651]  Great!

[02:30:23.610 --> 02:30:27.071]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:30:27.071 --> 02:30:28.352]  That's really incredible.
[02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:31.753]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:30:31.753 --> 02:30:32.773]  I haven't felt this week.
[02:30:32.773 --> 02:30:34.434]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:30:34.434 --> 02:30:35.675]  And I love the guys.
[02:30:35.675 --> 02:30:37.835]  I love the Info Wars crew.

[02:33:43.468 --> 02:33:47.431]  It's a product we hardly ever talk about, hardly ever plug, which is really a great product.
[02:33:47.431 --> 02:33:48.992]  We should talk about more.

[02:33:55.777 --> 02:34:01.842]  I mean, I know when I go on air and I've got like a sore throat or something going on, I just hit that Lung Cleanse and I'm like 100% like that.
[02:34:03.143 --> 02:34:07.345]  Yeah, it has saved my life the last few days.

[02:35:17.106 --> 02:35:18.426]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[02:35:18.426 --> 02:35:22.807]  Let's go to Scott in Maryland who wants to talk about the Brad Parscale tweet.
[02:35:22.807 --> 02:35:24.388]  Warning, Twitter, Google, and Facebook.
[02:35:24.388 --> 02:35:26.928]  Go ahead, Scott.
[02:35:26.928 --> 02:35:28.589]  Hey man, thanks for having me on.
[02:35:29.531 --> 02:35:29.631]  Hmm.
[02:35:59.028 --> 02:36:14.434]  Now, when I saw your subject on the list here, I was wondering if you meant that Brad Parscale was kind of subtweeting here saying, hey look, abandon your stock in Facebook, Twitter, and Google because they're about to go down.
[02:36:14.434 --> 02:36:15.915]  Oh no, I mean that's the thing.
[02:36:15.915 --> 02:36:19.936]  They want to plunge their stock to try and get you to sell out.
[02:36:19.936 --> 02:36:21.677]  But when that happens, buy more.
[02:36:22.587 --> 02:36:36.536]  So that you can be on that board, so that you can stop the censorship, so that you can replace the entire board of directors and get new, fresh people that are either more moderate or more conservative on there.
[02:36:36.536 --> 02:36:42.699]  I mean, we know Zuckerberg held a huge rally, I think it was last year or two years ago or something like that.
[02:36:42.699 --> 02:36:45.061]  The human t-shirt?
[02:36:45.061 --> 02:36:51.765]  Yeah, where he invited all the conservative people over, but he didn't really do anything with that other than know who to censor.
[02:36:52.076 --> 02:36:55.299]  Well, he's low energy, he's a prop, he's a walking human t-shirt.
[02:36:55.299 --> 02:36:57.480]  So, you know, that's what you get from Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:00.283]  Oh my, whoa, I didn't even know he ever wore a tie!
[02:37:00.283 --> 02:37:00.943]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:00.943 --> 02:37:02.545]  Hey, thank you for the call, Scott.
[02:37:02.545 --> 02:37:04.086]  Interesting stuff there, an interesting angle.
[02:37:04.086 --> 02:37:07.849]  I haven't really heard about anybody thinking about it or approaching it like that.
[02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:12.433]  Let's go to Mark, who is from the steel industry out in Atlanta.
[02:37:12.433 --> 02:37:14.754]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:37:14.754 --> 02:37:15.475]  Yeah, hey Owen.
[02:37:15.475 --> 02:37:16.016]  Hey, listen.
[02:37:16.992 --> 02:37:25.035]  I just wanted to make the point that domestically produced steel is a strategic asset for any country.
[02:37:25.035 --> 02:37:30.958]  And it was the steel industry here in America that actually won World War II.
[02:37:30.958 --> 02:37:39.581]  And I think it's a possibility Trump may be preparing this country for maybe a war with China.
[02:37:39.581 --> 02:37:40.501]  You know what?
[02:37:40.501 --> 02:37:42.602]  This is actually an excellent caller right here.
[02:37:44.679 --> 02:37:47.140]  I'm actually recalling too, not only did U.S.
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:58.022]  Steel manufacture during the war for the American Army, but also for the Nazis, I think for the Italians, and I think for like almost everyone involved in the war, U.S.
[02:37:58.022 --> 02:38:00.743]  Steel was being used to manufacture their weapons.
[02:38:00.743 --> 02:38:03.263]  So yeah, that's an interesting point.
[02:38:03.263 --> 02:38:10.545]  Bringing the steel back to America to give more leverage to the United States if the terrible situation of a war broke out.
[02:38:10.845 --> 02:38:12.226]  Right, good point.
[02:38:12.226 --> 02:38:13.568]  Anything else, Mark?
[02:38:13.568 --> 02:38:16.570]  Yeah, please remember that Japan wanted to rebuild.
[02:38:16.570 --> 02:38:24.558]  Japan was building aircraft out of wood because of their lack of raw, you know, resources to make steel.
[02:38:24.558 --> 02:38:33.986]  And it was, you know, then the fact that Japan was an island and had, they had to already had to import all their raw materials for the steel, for their steel industry.
[02:38:33.986 --> 02:38:36.309]  But as we cut those materials off,
[02:38:36.969 --> 02:38:39.652]  That was one of the things that helped us win World War II.
[02:38:39.652 --> 02:38:49.603]  So my point is, domestic steel production is an essential item if you're looking at a war, even a minor war.
[02:38:49.603 --> 02:38:50.904]  Yeah, and it's a total asset.
[02:38:50.904 --> 02:38:51.304]  Think about it.
[02:38:51.304 --> 02:38:56.089]  If your enemy wanted to cripple you and handicap you in the time of war, what they would do?
[02:38:56.089 --> 02:38:58.312]  They would shut down the steel manufacturing.
[02:38:58.312 --> 02:38:58.452]  Right.
[02:38:59.412 --> 02:39:02.673]  Well, you can't build tanks out of alloys.
[02:39:02.673 --> 02:39:04.234]  It has to be steel.
[02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:06.555]  Well, not good tanks anyway.
[02:39:06.555 --> 02:39:07.435]  What was the name of the company?
[02:39:07.435 --> 02:39:08.536]  Was it IG Farben?
[02:39:08.536 --> 02:39:12.537]  I can't remember.
[02:39:12.537 --> 02:39:14.478]  There was some steel manufacturing company in the United States.
[02:39:14.478 --> 02:39:18.179]  I mean, they were literally making, they were manufacturing everything for the whole war.
[02:39:18.179 --> 02:39:21.600]  I mean, they'd make the tanks for both sides.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:23.821]  So, I mean, yeah, great caller, Mark in Atlanta.
[02:39:23.821 --> 02:39:27.503]  Great point, how the steel industry is so important during times of war.
[02:39:28.439 --> 02:39:33.581]  And given the escalating tensions geopolitically, perhaps that's a strategic move by President Trump.
[02:39:33.581 --> 02:39:35.601]  Now let's go to Rob in Indiana.
[02:39:35.601 --> 02:39:38.382]  He's been working in the steel industry for almost three decades.
[02:39:38.382 --> 02:39:40.243]  Go ahead, Rob.
[02:39:40.243 --> 02:39:42.063]  Owen, how are you?
[02:39:42.063 --> 02:39:42.364]  Great.
[02:39:42.364 --> 02:39:43.944]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:39:43.944 --> 02:39:51.026]  As a matter of fact, I just want to tell you how much of a patriot you are and how much I appreciate listening to your common sense.
[02:39:51.026 --> 02:39:54.467]  It's refreshing, so thank you.
[02:39:54.467 --> 02:39:55.968]  Well, common sense isn't so common.
[02:39:57.677 --> 02:39:59.338]  Well, we're lacking that.
[02:39:59.338 --> 02:40:11.468]  Look, what I'm going to get at here is the media is not talking about the fact that we've been assaulted with what's called dump steel for the last 30 to 40 years.
[02:40:11.468 --> 02:40:18.393]  And what that means is that producers, other countries, they're actually making the steel.
[02:40:18.393 --> 02:40:25.118]  They're selling it below the cost of what it cost them to make the product.
[02:40:25.118 --> 02:40:25.499]  And then
[02:40:26.198 --> 02:40:30.201]  They are being reimbursed by their country for the difference.
[02:40:30.201 --> 02:40:32.283]  So they don't lose anything.
[02:40:32.283 --> 02:40:39.109]  But what they do is they undercut our market, which messes us up.
[02:40:39.109 --> 02:40:40.269]  So that's kind of like China.
[02:40:40.269 --> 02:40:43.532]  So that's kind of like China manipulating their currency.
[02:40:43.532 --> 02:40:45.093]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:40:45.093 --> 02:40:46.775]  It's called illegal dump steel.
[02:40:46.775 --> 02:40:47.415]  They've been doing it.
[02:40:47.415 --> 02:40:49.037]  We've been fighting it forever.
[02:40:49.037 --> 02:40:53.100]  And it's finally amazing to see a Republican president stand up
[02:40:53.717 --> 02:40:54.057]  Well, Robby,
[02:41:16.528 --> 02:41:20.271]  It says here you've been working in the steel industry for almost three decades.
[02:41:20.271 --> 02:41:23.433]  I mean, these are some of the toughest workers in the union here.
[02:41:23.433 --> 02:41:28.697]  I mean, what have you seen in the steel industry just since Trump's been elected?
[02:41:28.697 --> 02:41:32.940]  Well, I tell you what, what I've seen is just a huge push.
[02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:36.003]  We're actually almost running at capacity right now.
[02:41:36.003 --> 02:41:38.545]  Yeah, that's what I keep hearing.
[02:41:38.545 --> 02:41:40.366]  Yeah, we are.
[02:41:40.366 --> 02:41:42.828]  Where two years ago it was like you could hardly even get work.
[02:41:44.523 --> 02:41:45.044]  Well, that's true.
[02:41:45.044 --> 02:41:46.044]  And we're hiring now.
[02:41:46.044 --> 02:41:50.867]  We've had a dry spell with hiring for the last two to three, four years.
[02:41:50.867 --> 02:41:51.587]  Now we're hiring.
[02:41:51.587 --> 02:41:53.228]  We can't get enough people.
[02:41:53.228 --> 02:41:55.769]  So it's nice.
[02:41:55.769 --> 02:41:57.450]  It's good for our economy.
[02:41:57.450 --> 02:41:59.051]  And these are good paying jobs.
[02:41:59.051 --> 02:42:02.813]  But what people fail to realize is everything out here tries to kill us.
[02:42:02.813 --> 02:42:05.615]  And when you work in the steel industry, everything is trying to get you.
[02:42:05.615 --> 02:42:08.576]  Even the air you breathe is toxic.
[02:42:08.576 --> 02:42:11.618]  So, I mean, it's not a fun place to work by any means.
[02:42:12.662 --> 02:42:14.203]  But it's what we do.
[02:42:14.203 --> 02:42:15.543]  And it's the backbone of the country.
[02:42:15.543 --> 02:42:16.704]  I mean, exactly.
[02:42:16.704 --> 02:42:18.144]  That's the American grit.
[02:42:18.144 --> 02:42:21.506]  That's the American grit that created this nation.
[02:42:21.506 --> 02:42:23.006]  And you know what?
[02:42:23.006 --> 02:42:38.733]  When you work in the steel industry and you have to deal with the heat and the smelting and everything that you deal with and the toxic air, and you go home and you've got some beta-cuck son who wants to be, you know, some soy boy, you're not going to stand for that!
[02:42:39.293 --> 02:42:40.715]  They killed American grit!
[02:42:40.715 --> 02:42:43.457]  They killed American grit in the manufacturing industry.
[02:42:43.457 --> 02:42:45.139]  They killed American grit in the home.
[02:42:45.139 --> 02:42:47.021]  They killed American grit in the school.
[02:42:47.021 --> 02:42:50.965]  It's time for American grit to come back, and that's what President Trump is invoking.
[02:42:50.965 --> 02:42:52.486]  Alex Jones on the other side.
[02:42:52.486 --> 02:42:53.067]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:56.732 --> 02:43:02.237]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:43:02.237 --> 02:43:03.077]  I take this.
[02:43:03.077 --> 02:43:04.198]  My family takes this.
[02:43:04.198 --> 02:43:08.482]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.

[02:43:17.728 --> 02:43:18.848]  I don't feel good.
[02:43:18.848 --> 02:43:22.610]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:25.310]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:43:25.310 --> 02:43:31.093]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:43:31.093 --> 02:43:34.054]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:43:34.054 --> 02:43:37.595]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[02:43:37.595 --> 02:43:39.836]  So, obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[02:43:39.836 --> 02:43:40.196]  I love it.
[02:43:40.356 --> 02:43:43.161]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:43:43.161 --> 02:43:44.163]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:43:44.163 --> 02:43:50.133]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.

[02:43:52.016 --> 02:43:54.220]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.

[02:45:56.653 --> 02:45:57.574]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:45:57.574 --> 02:45:58.154]  Good, brother.
[02:45:58.154 --> 02:46:00.116]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:46:00.116 --> 02:46:01.817]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:46:01.817 --> 02:46:05.860]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:46:05.860 --> 02:46:08.462]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:46:08.462 --> 02:46:10.903]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:46:10.903 --> 02:46:18.709]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:46:18.949 --> 02:46:27.899]  We did a super male and a super female vitality big changes a lot of energy We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks energy shots saving a ton of money.
[02:46:27.899 --> 02:46:33.346]  They're sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then
[02:46:33.766 --> 02:46:35.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:24.485 --> 02:47:37.400]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:41.184]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:47:46.917 --> 02:48:08.592]  On the front cover of the current issue of Hollywood Reporter, it has members of the male cast of Silicon Valley putting their hands in each other's pockets in a very sexual way with the headline, the triumph of the beta male, the victory of the beta male, there to be celebrated for all to see.
[02:48:08.592 --> 02:48:10.773]  But what's really being said here?
[02:48:10.773 --> 02:48:14.096]  They're saying if you act like a domesticated
[02:48:15.546 --> 02:48:23.737]  Twisted version of an effeminate creature that somehow you're going to end up in dominant positions in the corporate world.
[02:48:23.737 --> 02:48:25.900]  Because you see, Jeff Bezos and
[02:48:27.188 --> 02:48:40.319]  All the rest of the heads of the tech titan companies are cold-blooded globalists who are committed to consolidating wealth and viciously dehumanizing the population.
[02:48:40.319 --> 02:48:52.009]  If you look at Apple, you look at Facebook, Twitter, you look at Amazon, all these companies pay either zero or next to zero taxes in the United States.
[02:48:53.103 --> 02:48:55.405]  They've all basically moved to China.
[02:48:55.405 --> 02:48:58.907]  Apple's actually merged with the Chinese government.
[02:48:58.907 --> 02:49:17.159]  But they project this issue of the beta male out into the population like it's cool and trendy so people accept the fact that they've been emasculated growing up indoors, watching television, playing video games, eating massive amounts of estrogen mimickers, not just the soy milk but the
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:20.181]  BPA and the rest of it in the plastics.
[02:49:20.181 --> 02:49:27.325]  And so they're basically making it cool, this synthetic transformation that has been engineered over the males.
[02:49:27.325 --> 02:49:36.470]  And the chemicals are so powerful that in most areas of the United States, 50 to 80 percent of the amphibian life is sterile.
[02:49:36.470 --> 02:49:43.294]  And in many cases, according to scientific studies, the male frogs prefer other male frogs.
[02:49:43.294 --> 02:49:45.515]  And so the female frogs never get their eggs.
[02:49:46.883 --> 02:49:46.983]  for
[02:50:04.318 --> 02:50:11.627]  The transformation has taken place and now with the genetic engineering and the genetic drift happening and the mutations exploding on our species.
[02:50:11.627 --> 02:50:20.397]  So if you looked at any other species and said they're going sterile, their IQs are dropping, their males are shriveled and weak.
[02:50:21.502 --> 02:50:39.446]  You would say, look at the decline of the polar bear, look at the decline of this type of praying mantis, or look at the decline of the red-tailed hawk, or look at the cause of pesticides on the condor falcon's eggs, almost making them go extinct.
[02:50:39.446 --> 02:50:42.167]  But instead, it's the triumph of the beta male.
[02:50:43.027 --> 02:50:51.715]  No, I've been friends with Mike Judge for years, creator of Silicon Valley, Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill, and he's a patriot, he's a libertarian, and I've seen the show.
[02:50:51.715 --> 02:50:56.840]  I don't think overall its message is bad in all cases, but it is a modern message.
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:51:00.483]  The point is the media takes what he's saying about Silicon Valley
[02:51:01.437 --> 02:51:04.938]  And then projects the idea that it's the triumph of the beta male.
[02:51:04.938 --> 02:51:18.963]  Silicon Valley is the triumph of alpha predators posing as other beta males and being part of the whole globalist engineering program that the former White House science star John P. Holdren wrote about the year I was born in 1974.
[02:51:18.963 --> 02:51:22.444]  The 1100 page book is free online.
[02:51:22.444 --> 02:51:25.085]  I'd advise you all to go scan over it.
[02:51:25.085 --> 02:51:28.446]  How they called for the emasculation of males with estrogen mimickers.
[02:51:29.762 --> 02:51:30.983]  In the food and water.
[02:51:30.983 --> 02:51:32.783]  So, look into all this.
[02:51:32.783 --> 02:51:42.427]  Now, for women, it's causing them to be hyper-feminine, but it's accelerating the aging of their ovaries, of their uterus, and of their breast tissue.
[02:51:42.427 --> 02:51:50.551]  All sexual tissue in the female body is associated with reproduction, is being aged at a very accelerated rate.
[02:51:50.551 --> 02:51:56.093]  When you have higher levels of glyphosate in the water and other estrogen mimicker, it actually accelerates even more and gives you cancer.
[02:51:57.478 --> 02:52:01.260]  All of this is admitted, incontrovertible fact.
[02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:04.942]  But again, they call it a triumph, so it's a beautiful thing.
[02:52:04.942 --> 02:52:11.706]  And they have, why the future doesn't need us, and all these publications about the earth after humans, and we're a scourge.
[02:52:11.706 --> 02:52:14.267]  They're teaching us to hate ourselves.
[02:52:14.267 --> 02:52:18.290]  The globals are teaching us to turn off our life force, to turn off our instincts.
[02:52:18.290 --> 02:52:20.911]  So there's that report on InfoWars.com.
[02:52:20.911 --> 02:52:24.113]  It's critical for people to understand, then, the soy boys
[02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:25.680]  We're good to go.
[02:52:50.311 --> 02:52:55.195]  Don't notice that they're being taken control of and being enslaved.
[02:52:55.195 --> 02:52:59.938]  And then the globalists are very good at then organizing the betas into what they call beta armies.
[02:52:59.938 --> 02:53:02.980]  And remember, I've been telling you about this for years.
[02:53:02.980 --> 02:53:09.665]  And now you're seeing it being mainstream news that the nerd armies, the beta armies, well, the nerd armies are being enslaved themselves.
[02:53:09.665 --> 02:53:18.052]  But if they believe they're part of the ruling class and are in on the big joke and in on the censorship at Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, you name it,
[02:53:19.501 --> 02:53:27.748]  They'll go along long enough until the AI and the algorithms and the Chinese communists who are now taking over Apple are able to replace them.
[02:53:27.748 --> 02:53:29.009]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[02:53:29.009 --> 02:53:31.991]  They're just like IBM engineers I knew 20 years ago.
[02:53:31.991 --> 02:53:33.612]  Several of them were my friends.
[02:53:33.612 --> 02:53:35.754]  And they thought, oh, Alex will never get rid of us.
[02:53:35.754 --> 02:53:38.015]  Sure, we're training our replacements.
[02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:48.635]  And then years later, when they got let go, first their pay got cut, then they got let go, they understood then that they were destroying their own economy.
[02:53:48.635 --> 02:53:54.419]  When you demand a better economy and better pay and more complex systems, it's upwardly mobile.
[02:53:54.419 --> 02:54:00.303]  But when you bring in centralized systems, command and control systems, it limits choices and vertically integrates wealth.
[02:54:00.303 --> 02:54:07.527]  And there's many examples of this in history, but just look at capitalism versus communism and other command and control systems like fascism and socialism.
[02:54:07.527 --> 02:54:09.128]  They do not work at all.
[02:54:10.029 --> 02:54:12.271]  Because they're not designed to work for the average person.
[02:54:12.271 --> 02:54:14.773]  They're designed to work for predatory elite.
[02:54:14.773 --> 02:54:29.284]  Then if you see another story on Infowars.com right now, it's how in major studies, in a new big study, this guy television did in the UK, people find women that say they're feminist incredibly unattractive and don't want to have anything to do with them.
[02:54:30.416 --> 02:54:43.404]  The plan is to get women to be unattractive and to not be into a normal mammalian pattern, and to have men so arrested in their development that they only want to hang around with other men, like their 12-year-old boys.
[02:54:43.404 --> 02:54:48.007]  It's not a gay thing, it's an arrested development thing, so the two sexes never get together.
[02:54:49.201 --> 02:54:58.906]  And then if the sexes do want to get together, there's so much Me Too movement demonizing the whole system between men and women coming together, that it also stifles that, and the studies show it as well.
[02:54:58.906 --> 02:55:14.035]  And again, you pull back, it's the triumph of the end of humanity, the triumph of a deaf culture, the triumph of a culture committing suicide, a triumph of the fall of humanity as we know it, and the upwardly mobile renaissance systems that can take us to the stars.
[02:55:14.855 --> 02:55:26.404]  And it's being done because a breakaway civilization has decided the general public doesn't deserve to be part of the future or the life extension or any of the mysteries of the universe that we fellow humans have discovered and developed.
[02:55:26.404 --> 02:55:43.637]  They intend to cut the resources off, use governmental and corporate systems to extract the wealth and ideas, put it through a cultural wall of the breakaway civilization while they build their structure and while we ourselves are basically then just recycled.
[02:55:43.637 --> 02:55:44.178]  That's the plan.
[02:55:45.339 --> 02:55:46.380]  This isn't a video game.
[02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:47.400]  It's not a science fiction book.
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:48.081]  It's the real world.
[02:55:48.081 --> 02:56:00.430]  But a lot of people have decided to be delusional through their cognitive dissonance and decide they're part of the structure, even though that structure is destroying them, and to imagine that they're actually part of the power structure and are alphas.
[02:56:00.430 --> 02:56:07.175]  So this whole beta thing is a alpha-directed, psycho-alpha-directed system organizing betas.
[02:56:08.095 --> 02:56:11.397]  Alright, that is the Prime Computation Analysis.
[02:56:11.397 --> 02:56:14.619]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:25.731 --> 02:56:26.832]  Please research everything I've said.
[02:56:26.832 --> 02:56:28.712]  You'll find out it's all in the public venue.
[02:56:28.712 --> 02:56:30.773]  The globalists believe you're complete idiots.
[02:56:30.773 --> 02:56:32.034]  I believe in you.
[02:56:32.034 --> 02:56:35.316]  I have to believe in you because I know it's a feedback loop.
[02:56:35.316 --> 02:56:39.958]  If I start believing you don't matter, if I start believing you're scum, then why should I care about my own children and the future for them?
[02:56:39.958 --> 02:56:41.399]  I do believe in my children.
[02:56:41.399 --> 02:56:42.019]  I believe in you and I
[02:56:44.645 --> 02:56:44.865]  I think?
[02:57:09.625 --> 02:57:12.368]  This is the war for the future, and I'm Alex Jones, your Chronicler.
[02:57:24.691 --> 02:57:29.614]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:57:29.614 --> 02:57:32.136]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:57:32.136 --> 02:57:34.117]  Michael ZX is back!
[02:57:34.117 --> 02:57:41.041]  And just like we're game-changing when it comes to politics, when it comes to the economy, we're game-changing on supplements.

[02:57:57.032 --> 02:58:06.478]  Let me tell you, fungus is a scourge, mold's a scourge, and you can't battle it with this in your sinus or other areas, but in your gut, the main area, you can.
[02:58:06.478 --> 02:58:08.860]  MycoZX, available exclusively.

[02:58:38.053 --> 02:58:40.915]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:58:40.915 --> 02:58:42.897]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:58:42.897 --> 02:58:47.901]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:58:47.901 --> 02:58:50.003]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:58:50.003 --> 02:58:51.284]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:58:51.284 --> 02:58:56.429]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:58:56.429 --> 02:58:59.752]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:58:59.912 --> 02:59:00.412]  We're good to go!
[02:59:27.526 --> 02:59:28.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!

[03:01:36.382 --> 03:01:39.823]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:01:39.823 --> 03:01:40.464]  Get to it.
[03:01:40.464 --> 03:01:41.644]  You know the exchange.
[03:01:41.644 --> 03:01:43.625]  You know the way this works.
[03:01:43.625 --> 03:01:48.608]  InfoWars fights the info war with you, for you, by you.
[03:01:50.154 --> 03:02:00.319]  You buy products that improve your health tremendously and InfoWars uses that money to expand their operations.
[03:02:00.319 --> 03:02:02.080]  It's very straightforward, very simple.
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:03.521]  This is not government funding.
[03:02:03.521 --> 03:02:06.002]  This is not mega corporate funding.
[03:02:06.002 --> 03:02:08.904]  This is nothing like that.
[03:02:08.904 --> 03:02:10.524]  Okay.
[03:02:10.524 --> 03:02:13.026]  Let's get to these major stories.
[03:02:13.026 --> 03:02:17.468]  First of all, here's something breaking from Australia, which is very important.
[03:02:18.421 --> 03:02:28.230]  And I want to give credit to an independent media operation out there because we all are now depending on independent media supporting it.
[03:02:28.230 --> 03:02:39.461]  The Crazz Files, C-R-A-Z-Z, the Crazz Files in Australia reports on a defeat in Australia of a bill
[03:02:40.709 --> 03:02:49.151]  That would crush alternative, complementary, traditional medicine such as Chinese medicine.
[03:02:49.151 --> 03:03:02.894]  There was a major coup attempt really in Australia so that all of these alternative traditional products would be marked with some kind of a government notice claiming
[03:03:04.239 --> 03:03:07.100]  This is all pseudoscience, beware.
[03:03:07.100 --> 03:03:12.202]  I mean, you know, if you want some reason not to buy a product, right?
[03:03:12.202 --> 03:03:17.344]  Hey, this is a great product, but it's pseudoscience, so beware and don't get it.
[03:03:17.344 --> 03:03:19.485]  That's kind of what the government was trying to do.
[03:03:19.485 --> 03:03:31.370]  Well, this went down in flames, a crushing defeat, because as it turns out, the people of Australia strongly support alternative
[03:03:32.037 --> 03:03:42.682]  Complimentary, traditional medicine, whatever you want to call it, natural health, or even just health.
[03:03:42.682 --> 03:03:54.688]  So this has gone down to an astounding defeat for the forces of evil in Australia, which is a major victory.
[03:03:54.688 --> 03:03:59.791]  So I put up an article about this at No More Fake News, and I included
[03:04:01.261 --> 03:04:06.305]  A part two, which is a major revelation.
[03:04:06.305 --> 03:04:14.390]  Basically what I'm saying is, do you think modern medicine is as is described by mainstream press?
[03:04:14.390 --> 03:04:16.872]  Do you really think that's what it is?
[03:04:16.872 --> 03:04:19.974]  Unending progress and so forth?
[03:04:19.974 --> 03:04:22.496]  The dark side is concealed.
[03:04:22.496 --> 03:04:26.399]  The conspiracy, yes, is concealed.
[03:04:26.399 --> 03:04:30.462]  And the reason basically is, as I've reported before,
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:35.341]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:04:35.341 --> 03:04:36.402]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:04:36.402 --> 03:04:41.863]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:04:49.858 --> 03:05:01.362]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:05:01.362 --> 03:05:10.445]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:05:10.945 --> 03:05:16.727]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:05:16.727 --> 03:05:22.168]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:05:22.168 --> 03:05:24.429]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:05:24.429 --> 03:05:26.450]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:05:27.441 --> 03:05:30.743]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:05:30.743 --> 03:05:32.764]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:05:32.764 --> 03:05:36.066]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:05:36.066 --> 03:05:38.607]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:05:38.607 --> 03:05:40.608]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[03:05:50.962 --> 03:05:55.465]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:05:55.465 --> 03:05:58.867]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:58.867 --> 03:06:05.692]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:06:05.692 --> 03:06:12.517]  Okay, back after the break, John Rappaport here, sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour at InfoWars.
[03:06:12.517 --> 03:06:15.679]  So, I was just talking about this major victory in Australia.
[03:06:16.619 --> 03:06:34.071]  The globalist forces of evil over there were trying to brand all alternative natural health remedies as pseudoscience, warning, beware, etc, etc.
[03:06:34.071 --> 03:06:37.193]  So when we went to the break, I said, all this is about globalism.
[03:06:37.193 --> 03:06:44.918]  It's about globalism's medical cartel, which is attacking the globalist population, as I've talked about here many times.
[03:06:44.918 --> 03:06:45.178]  Why?
[03:06:45.953 --> 03:06:55.938]  Because if you're going to control a planet, you've got to weaken and disable the population.
[03:06:55.938 --> 03:07:13.047]  And what better way to do that than through a complicated system of medical treatment that advertises itself as the essence of what humanity is all about.
[03:07:13.047 --> 03:07:14.388]  That's the front story.
[03:07:15.040 --> 03:07:40.077]  Behind that is the pain, the suffering, the toxicity, and the disabling medical treatments that soften up the global population for takeover, so that we end up with basically one company, one country, or you could call it a company, called Planet Earth, that is under a strict global management system.
[03:07:40.077 --> 03:07:42.658]  No borders, no nations.
[03:07:42.658 --> 03:07:44.640]  That's the long-range objective.
[03:07:46.485 --> 03:08:00.893]  So, in this article that I posted today, talking about the victory in Australia, I said, well, let's look at the dark side, what is being concealed about modern medicine.
[03:08:00.893 --> 03:08:04.135]  In fact, let's go to the authorities.
[03:08:04.135 --> 03:08:15.642]  Let's go to people who are consummate insiders, who have looked at, read and scrutinized more medical studies
[03:08:16.761 --> 03:08:29.272]  over a long period of time than any doctor, any medical bureaucrat, any medical school instructor on the planet.
[03:08:29.272 --> 03:08:43.205]  So the first insider is Dr. Marcia Angell, formerly the editor of one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, New England Journal of Medicine.
[03:08:44.762 --> 03:08:51.303]  And let me read you a quote of hers from 2009 New York Review of Books.
[03:08:51.303 --> 03:08:52.344]  Listen carefully.
[03:08:52.344 --> 03:08:55.324]  Screw in your thinking cap on this.
[03:08:55.324 --> 03:09:09.187]  She says, It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.
[03:09:10.939 --> 03:09:25.383]  I take no pleasure in this conclusion which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.
[03:09:25.383 --> 03:09:28.863]  Cue the ominous music, folks.
[03:09:28.863 --> 03:09:37.666]  That is a consummate insider deciding that she can't take it any longer and she goes public.
[03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:39.086]  What is she saying, basically?
[03:09:40.689 --> 03:09:49.173]  She is saying that by and large what you read in medical journals is a fraud, a complete fraud.
[03:09:49.173 --> 03:10:03.840]  That would include clinical trials of medical drugs that are supposed to be safe and effective when in fact they are disabling, toxic, and destructive.
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:06.521]  That's what she's fessing up to.
[03:10:08.220 --> 03:10:13.342]  Let's take one more here from the pile.
[03:10:13.342 --> 03:10:18.264]  Let me just read the quote, part of it, and then I'll give you the source.
[03:10:18.264 --> 03:10:21.986]  The case against science is straightforward.
[03:10:21.986 --> 03:10:27.428]  Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue.
[03:10:28.892 --> 03:10:53.786]  Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn toward darkness.
[03:10:53.786 --> 03:10:55.527]  That ain't me.
[03:10:55.527 --> 03:10:56.848]  That's not me talking.
[03:10:58.087 --> 03:11:09.934]  That is Dr. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, which is, again, one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world.
[03:11:09.934 --> 03:11:14.277]  A statement he made in April of 2015.
[03:11:14.277 --> 03:11:23.523]  Getting the message here, this is absolutely incredible.
[03:11:23.523 --> 03:11:25.884]  Insiders coming out and confessing
[03:11:27.799 --> 03:11:53.005]  And so I say, well, if all of this medical literature is fake and false and fake news, and the clinical trials of these wondrous drugs are faked and false and incompetent, then we ought to be seeing widespread destruction from medical drugs because of the flagrant fraudulence
[03:11:54.335 --> 03:12:03.379]  At which point people who only get their news from mainstream television would say, well, I see no evidence of a widespread medical scandal.
[03:12:03.379 --> 03:12:06.380]  Yeah, well, there is.
[03:12:06.380 --> 03:12:07.020]  There is.
[03:12:07.020 --> 03:12:07.740]  Where?
[03:12:07.740 --> 03:12:14.083]  Where is it reported in the open source medical literature?
[03:12:14.083 --> 03:12:18.105]  July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association.
[03:12:18.105 --> 03:12:21.626]  Again, insiders are fessing up.
[03:12:23.450 --> 03:12:32.255]  Dr. Barbara Starfield, a revered public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, writes a review, is U.S.
[03:12:32.255 --> 03:12:34.676]  health really the best in the world?
[03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:46.423]  And one of her shocking conclusions, among several, is that every year in the U.S., correctly prescribed FDA-approved medical drugs kill 106,000 people.
[03:12:49.128 --> 03:12:56.692]  Thus, every decade these drugs kill more than a million people in the U.S.
[03:12:56.692 --> 03:13:01.715]  Wrap your mind around that if you can.
[03:13:01.715 --> 03:13:16.663]  That is exactly what we would predict after hearing those two insiders, Dr. Angell and Dr. Horton, of these two prestigious medical journals talk about medical fraud.
[03:13:18.001 --> 03:13:36.287]  And to add my commentary to it, this is also exactly what we would expect from the medical cartel, which is the most toxic arm of the globalist enterprise to take over the planet.
[03:13:36.287 --> 03:13:47.030]  Because again, if you're going to soften up the population, if you're going to make people incapable of thinking or reasoning or getting an education if it's offered to them,
[03:13:48.326 --> 03:14:02.971]  Or knowing what's what, being able to look down below the fake news to see the real news, to be able to resist, to be able to stand their ground, to be able to have courage.
[03:14:02.971 --> 03:14:15.355]  If you want to eliminate all of that, not just here and there and now and then, but on a continuous, ongoing basis, what are you going to do?
[03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:20.871]  You're going to get people to go to their doctor all the time.
[03:14:20.871 --> 03:14:29.196]  You're going to have drug ad after drug ad on television convincing people that this is the only way to treat their symptoms.
[03:14:29.196 --> 03:14:32.538]  If they want to remain healthy, they have to get these drugs.
[03:14:32.538 --> 03:14:33.739]  They have to go to the doctor.
[03:14:33.739 --> 03:14:39.522]  They have to ask a doctor if this drug is right for you.
[03:14:39.522 --> 03:14:40.123]  Because
[03:14:41.008 --> 03:15:02.781]  This provides the endless bleak trail from cradle to grave of medical cartel, toxic, debilitating, destroying treatments of every kind imaginable for every kind of disease you could imagine.
[03:15:02.781 --> 03:15:08.485]  Many, many of which are fake to begin with.
[03:15:08.485 --> 03:15:10.326]  To weaken and soften.
[03:15:11.693 --> 03:15:14.015]  populations.
[03:15:14.015 --> 03:15:15.697]  That's the game.
[03:15:15.697 --> 03:15:16.618]  That's the deal.
[03:15:16.618 --> 03:15:23.725]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:15:23.725 --> 03:15:28.590]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:15:28.590 --> 03:15:30.052]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:15:40.523 --> 03:15:43.104]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banyan Hill.
[03:15:43.104 --> 03:15:44.265]  You like freedom?
[03:15:44.265 --> 03:15:45.005]  I do.
[03:15:45.005 --> 03:15:45.985]  You like money?
[03:15:45.985 --> 03:15:46.506]  I do too.
[03:15:46.506 --> 03:15:50.908]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love Freedom Checks.
[03:15:50.908 --> 03:15:57.571]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[03:15:58.191 --> 03:15:59.211]  Yep, you heard that right.
[03:15:59.211 --> 03:16:02.033]  $34.6 billion.
[03:16:02.033 --> 03:16:07.475]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[03:16:07.475 --> 03:16:10.056]  Thousands of people are already lined up to cash in.
[03:16:10.056 --> 03:16:11.436]  Take Doug, for example.
[03:16:11.436 --> 03:16:15.438]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[03:16:15.438 --> 03:16:19.480]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:21.161]  But here's the thing.
[03:16:21.161 --> 03:16:29.431]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[03:16:29.431 --> 03:16:30.452]  So don't wait.

[03:16:35.738 --> 03:16:39.082]  That's www.americanfreedomchecks.com.

[03:16:44.726 --> 03:16:46.327]  Savory and delicious.
[03:16:46.327 --> 03:16:49.148]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:16:49.148 --> 03:16:49.809]  Awesome.

[03:16:59.255 --> 03:17:00.676]  Or warm and served.
[03:17:00.676 --> 03:17:02.738]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.

[03:17:09.982 --> 03:17:11.202]  Hear that?
[03:17:11.202 --> 03:17:16.584]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:17:16.584 --> 03:17:19.485]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:17:19.485 --> 03:17:23.066]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[03:17:23.066 --> 03:17:30.628]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[03:17:35.229 --> 03:17:37.670]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.

[03:17:41.112 --> 03:17:45.515]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:17:45.515 --> 03:17:53.600]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:17:53.600 --> 03:17:58.904]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:17:58.904 --> 03:18:01.425]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:01.425 --> 03:18:05.648]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:05.648 --> 03:18:08.090]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:18:08.770 --> 03:18:16.016]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:18:16.016 --> 03:18:24.082]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:18:24.082 --> 03:18:31.268]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:18:31.268 --> 03:18:32.729]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:18:42.753 --> 03:18:43.994]  Go ahead.
[03:18:43.994 --> 03:18:45.934]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:18:45.934 --> 03:18:55.297]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:18:56.105 --> 03:19:02.887]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:19:02.887 --> 03:19:05.248]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:19:05.248 --> 03:19:06.188]  Thank you.
[03:19:06.188 --> 03:19:08.689]  I use the BioTruth Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:19:08.689 --> 03:19:12.991]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:19:12.991 --> 03:19:16.032]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:19:16.032 --> 03:19:17.352]  They are quality.
[03:19:17.352 --> 03:19:19.073]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:19:19.073 --> 03:19:21.974]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:19:21.974 --> 03:19:22.494]  Absolutely.
[03:19:23.034 --> 03:19:44.272]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:19:44.272 --> 03:19:46.895]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.378 --> 03:20:12.380]  John Rappaport here, sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour at InfoWars.
[03:20:12.380 --> 03:20:23.524]  Before I move on to the next major story, I want to remind you again, defeat CNN's attempt to crush InfoWars with the Operation Paul Revere Week 2 2018 special.
[03:20:23.524 --> 03:20:24.405]  That's 30 to 80% off site-wide.

[03:21:01.255 --> 03:21:03.876]  Okay.
[03:21:03.876 --> 03:21:08.199]  Weaponizing the stock market.
[03:21:08.199 --> 03:21:11.580]  That's an interesting idea, isn't it?
[03:21:11.580 --> 03:21:13.902]  How do you do that?
[03:21:13.902 --> 03:21:16.703]  Why is it important?
[03:21:16.703 --> 03:21:19.324]  Dig in deep on this one, folks.
[03:21:19.324 --> 03:21:26.188]  This applies to Trump, but it applies to every other president as well.
[03:21:26.188 --> 03:21:27.929]  If you control the stock market,
[03:21:29.895 --> 03:21:39.478]  You control the perception, underlined a hundred times, of how the overall economy is doing.
[03:21:39.478 --> 03:21:42.399]  Okay?
[03:21:42.399 --> 03:21:56.264]  Despite the fact that the stock market, by and large, is a giant Vegas casino and has nothing to do with how the overall economy is doing.
[03:21:56.264 --> 03:21:59.365]  You've got to get that idea through your noggin.
[03:22:01.610 --> 03:22:22.074]  Yes, when a company decides to go public and issues what's called an initial public offering or an IPO, the money from the sale of that stock during a limited time period does go back to the company so that they can expand.
[03:22:22.074 --> 03:22:28.435]  But by and large, the overwhelming majority of activity
[03:22:29.281 --> 03:22:36.383]  In this giant casino called the stock market is buy and sell, buy and sell, buy and sell, buy and sell.
[03:22:36.383 --> 03:22:37.744]  Put down your bets.
[03:22:37.744 --> 03:22:40.825]  Are you betting the stock is going to go up or it's going to go down?
[03:22:40.825 --> 03:22:41.985]  Place your bets, folks.
[03:22:41.985 --> 03:22:44.886]  Here we go.
[03:22:44.886 --> 03:22:53.429]  And like any Vegas casino operation, there is an advantage for the house.
[03:22:55.074 --> 03:23:02.417]  But in this case, in the stock market, we're talking about something even more severe.
[03:23:02.417 --> 03:23:10.901]  The advantage for the insiders is monumental because they basically rigged the game.
[03:23:10.901 --> 03:23:14.283]  They can take a stock up and they can push it down.
[03:23:14.283 --> 03:23:18.845]  They can take the overall stock market up or they can push it down.
[03:23:19.975 --> 03:23:30.705]  They can take this precious thing called the Dow Industrial Average stock average and send it up or take it down.
[03:23:30.705 --> 03:23:45.078]  And then all of the pundits climb on board and they begin to spew their garbage about what the direction of the stock market means in terms of the overall economy.
[03:23:49.093 --> 03:23:53.315]  That's how you control the President.
[03:23:53.315 --> 03:24:17.886]  Because if the performance of the stock market is perceived to be a reflection of the overall economy, and the President, sitting in the White House, has economic policies, then by taking the stock market down, if they want to, the insiders can then just simply point at the President and say, this is why.
[03:24:19.088 --> 03:24:24.629]  Not only the stock market is going down, but the overall economy is down.
[03:24:24.629 --> 03:24:43.414]  When, as I pointed out here at the top, the gigantic casino called the stock market has nothing to do with the overall economy, which has to do with production, which has to do with sales, which has to do with certain key industries, etc., etc., etc.
[03:24:43.414 --> 03:24:47.575]  Not about selling and buying stocks in the
[03:24:48.857 --> 03:24:51.598]  Casino.
[03:24:51.598 --> 03:24:55.098]  So.
[03:24:55.098 --> 03:25:02.260]  Many people noticed when Trump was elected that he surrounded himself with key Goldman Sachs people.
[03:25:02.260 --> 03:25:04.821]  Goldman Sachs is.
[03:25:04.821 --> 03:25:07.061]  You know, what are you going to call it?
[03:25:07.061 --> 03:25:13.522]  The giant squid as has been used.
[03:25:13.522 --> 03:25:15.763]  One of the largest investment banks.
[03:25:17.509 --> 03:25:22.871]  financial behemoths in the world.
[03:25:22.871 --> 03:25:25.172]  What was Trump doing?
[03:25:25.172 --> 03:25:29.694]  What would any president be doing by surrounding himself with Goldman Sachs people?
[03:25:29.694 --> 03:25:32.356]  Making a deal.
[03:25:32.356 --> 03:25:38.278]  Making a deal to protect himself and what he intended to do.
[03:25:38.278 --> 03:25:41.059]  And basically the deal was this.
[03:25:41.059 --> 03:25:46.382]  Goldman Sachs said, look, Mr. President, we can keep the stock market up for you.
[03:25:46.382 --> 03:25:46.982]  We can do that.
[03:25:49.281 --> 03:25:57.169]  And by doing that, we will create the perception that the economy is doing well.
[03:25:57.169 --> 03:26:06.138]  Now, you have to actually come in behind that with policies that, in reality, make the economy do well.
[03:26:06.138 --> 03:26:09.561]  That's your business.
[03:26:09.561 --> 03:26:11.043]  We have no problem with that.
[03:26:12.375 --> 03:26:24.862]  But since that has nothing to do with the stock market, we can keep the stock market up for you, thus creating the perception that you're doing a good job.
[03:26:24.862 --> 03:26:37.069]  Because if it goes down, way down, everybody and his brother is going to say, you're the reason why, Mr. President, and your presidency is going to crash on the rocks.
[03:26:40.029 --> 03:26:41.650]  Trump understands that.
[03:26:41.650 --> 03:26:44.832]  Every president gets that.
[03:26:44.832 --> 03:26:52.678]  It's not a mystery to those people, but it's a mystery to the public.
[03:26:52.678 --> 03:26:56.480]  Now, you recently saw two episodes.
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:03.745]  One, Trump said that he was going to lay on tariffs, 25% on steel coming into the country and 10% on aluminum.
[03:27:07.748 --> 03:27:19.171]  This was perhaps a major signal that Trump was going to double down on his anti-globalist economic policy.
[03:27:19.171 --> 03:27:24.812]  Because for globalists, there must be no tariffs.
[03:27:24.812 --> 03:27:35.715]  Megacorporations must be able to roam the international landscape like dinosaurs of old, picking up cash and assets
[03:27:36.550 --> 03:28:03.744]  Putting in investments, taking out investments, closing down factories in industrial countries, and taking them to hell holes, where the same products can be produced at a tiny fraction of the cost, at slave wages, with no environmental protection for workers whatsoever, and no tariffs on these products coming back into the country, which is sheer insanity.
[03:28:03.744 --> 03:28:06.125]  That's how to destroy an economy, which is
[03:28:07.088 --> 03:28:13.595]  What globalists obviously intend to do in the industrial countries and they're well underway.
[03:28:13.595 --> 03:28:14.636]  Got that?
[03:28:14.636 --> 03:28:16.318]  More when we come back on InfoWeek.
[03:28:40.151 --> 03:28:45.254]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:28:45.254 --> 03:28:50.957]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[03:29:42.876 --> 03:29:45.477]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[03:29:45.477 --> 03:29:52.960]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:29:52.960 --> 03:30:03.185]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:30:03.605 --> 03:30:11.447]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[03:30:11.447 --> 03:30:21.648]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:30:21.648 --> 03:30:23.689]  And this part is most important.
[03:30:23.689 --> 03:30:30.090]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:39.192]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:30:51.656 --> 03:30:53.719]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:30:53.719 --> 03:30:56.583]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:30:56.583 --> 03:30:58.065]  It's made in the USA.
[03:30:58.065 --> 03:31:04.914]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:31:04.914 --> 03:31:06.136]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:31:06.977 --> 03:31:16.681]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:31:16.681 --> 03:31:33.488]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:31:33.488 --> 03:31:36.649]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:31:36.789 --> 03:31:40.893]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:40.893 --> 03:31:44.296]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowarslife.
[03:31:44.296 --> 03:31:48.260]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:31:48.260 --> 03:31:51.603]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:31:51.603 --> 03:31:53.565]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:31:54.125 --> 03:31:58.867]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:31:58.867 --> 03:32:01.207]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:32:01.207 --> 03:32:08.229]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:08.229 --> 03:32:15.392]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:16.412 --> 03:32:21.475]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:32:21.475 --> 03:32:29.118]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:32:29.118 --> 03:32:34.021]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[03:32:34.021 --> 03:32:36.322]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:32:44.239 --> 03:32:53.001]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:53.001 --> 03:32:58.562]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:32:58.562 --> 03:33:07.763]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:07.763 --> 03:33:10.824]  John Rappaport back in the fourth hour sitting in for Alex here.
[03:33:13.454 --> 03:33:16.016]  And here's where I left it off.
[03:33:16.016 --> 03:33:22.140]  Told you to put your thinking cap on because this is serious stuff.
[03:33:22.140 --> 03:33:30.905]  The globalists want no tariffs on any product anywhere in the world to benefit their mega corporate agendas.
[03:33:30.905 --> 03:33:37.149]  So that means, ridiculously, that a company in the Americas or any industrialized nation
[03:33:38.820 --> 03:33:52.507]  Shut down their factory, fire their workers, take their factory to some hellhole where they can pay workers three cents an hour and there's no environmental protection for those workers whatsoever.
[03:33:52.507 --> 03:33:57.669]  Manufacture the product at a tiny cost.
[03:33:57.669 --> 03:34:07.194]  Bring them on back, bring those products back to the original countries that they left undercutting more competitors, destroying more business.
[03:34:08.294 --> 03:34:13.357]  Wrecking more economies, throwing more people out of work.
[03:34:13.357 --> 03:34:16.038]  This is globalism.
[03:34:16.038 --> 03:34:23.001]  So whenever the globalists hear that a president is going to lay on tariffs, what does that mean?
[03:34:23.001 --> 03:34:35.047]  Well that means, okay boys, if you who are manufacturing, say, steel in some foreign nation, want to export that steel to America and sell it here,
[03:34:36.053 --> 03:34:49.623]  All right, but we're going to charge you an additional 25% to sell it in America to level the playing field with domestic producers of steel.
[03:34:49.623 --> 03:34:51.144]  Only fair.
[03:34:51.144 --> 03:34:53.125]  Globalists don't like it.
[03:34:53.125 --> 03:34:55.267]  Absolutely not.
[03:34:55.267 --> 03:34:56.387]  They don't like that at all.
[03:34:56.387 --> 03:35:00.750]  They take that as a very, very bad sign.
[03:35:00.750 --> 03:35:05.494]  I would contend that's really why they got Richard Nixon out of the White House.
[03:35:06.488 --> 03:35:08.569]  There's a long history to that.
[03:35:08.569 --> 03:35:10.910]  Nixon started to do the same thing.
[03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:20.074]  He started to protect a few industries in America and began to lay on tariffs on imported goods.
[03:35:20.074 --> 03:35:21.615]  Globalists don't like that.
[03:35:21.615 --> 03:35:23.256]  That's not their agenda.
[03:35:23.256 --> 03:35:29.298]  They stand for mega corporate license as opposed to freedom.
[03:35:29.298 --> 03:35:34.461]  To roam the world and destroy while making
[03:35:35.808 --> 03:35:39.531]  Billions, trillions, in the process.
[03:35:39.531 --> 03:35:41.793]  So, that's what Trump announced.
[03:35:41.793 --> 03:35:56.785]  He said 25% tariff on steel, 10% on aluminum, and then Gary Cohn, Chief Economic Advisor to the President, resigned.
[03:35:56.785 --> 03:35:58.586]  Who is Gary Cohn?
[03:35:58.586 --> 03:36:05.132]  Well, he is the past President and CEO of, drumroll,
[03:36:06.218 --> 03:36:09.021]  Goldman Sachs.
[03:36:09.021 --> 03:36:13.144]  Goldman Sachs.
[03:36:13.144 --> 03:36:19.490]  Who in the last segment, I indicated Trump had made a deal with.
[03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:25.035]  Goldman Sachs said to Trump, we can maintain the perception that the U.S.
[03:36:25.035 --> 03:36:28.859]  economy is strong by keeping the stock market up.
[03:36:29.784 --> 03:36:38.667]  Hey, we know the stock market giant casino has nothing to do with the economy, the real economy, but everybody thinks it does.
[03:36:38.667 --> 03:36:39.807]  That's the perception.
[03:36:39.807 --> 03:36:47.130]  So you need somebody, Mr. President, to keep the stock market up and we can do that for you.
[03:36:47.130 --> 03:36:54.112]  Unless you start doing things that, you know, rub us the wrong way.
[03:36:55.074 --> 03:37:09.384]  That really begin to make a deep incursion against the globalist agenda, in which case we could bail on you and do something different with the stock market.
[03:37:09.384 --> 03:37:14.387]  Gary Cohn resigns, former president and CEO of Goldman Sachs.
[03:37:14.387 --> 03:37:17.809]  He resigns as Trump economic advisor.
[03:37:17.809 --> 03:37:23.213]  Stock market begins to get wobbly and go down, come back at wobbly, go down again back.
[03:37:24.210 --> 03:37:28.633]  And of course, what do all the pundits say?
[03:37:28.633 --> 03:37:31.535]  Oh, this is a very bad sign.
[03:37:31.535 --> 03:37:41.682]  It's reflecting overall trouble in the economy in America and trade wars on the horizon, etc., etc., etc.
[03:37:41.682 --> 03:37:45.304]  Doom, gloom, big clouds ominously overhead.
[03:37:45.304 --> 03:37:46.405]  Well, that's their job.
[03:37:46.405 --> 03:37:52.129]  That's what they're supposed to do to keep the globalist agenda on track.
[03:37:53.337 --> 03:38:10.344]  Is to maintain this mind control equation between the performance of a giant insider rigged casino called the stock market and the real overall economy and its performance.
[03:38:10.344 --> 03:38:13.826]  Understand that.
[03:38:13.826 --> 03:38:16.827]  So what will we see now?
[03:38:16.827 --> 03:38:19.168]  Remains to be seen.
[03:38:19.168 --> 03:38:20.869]  What is Goldman Sachs thinking?
[03:38:20.869 --> 03:38:21.809]  What are they saying?
[03:38:22.725 --> 03:38:28.887]  How far do they want to go in torpedoing the perception that the U.S.
[03:38:28.887 --> 03:38:33.448]  economy is recovering and doing well?
[03:38:33.448 --> 03:38:34.749]  We'll find out.
[03:38:34.749 --> 03:38:36.329]  But that's the game.
[03:38:36.329 --> 03:38:39.270]  That's the way the game is played, folks.
[03:38:39.270 --> 03:38:44.592]  Every president faces the same situation.
[03:38:44.592 --> 03:38:51.694]  Making a deal with somebody who can keep the stock market up.
[03:38:54.096 --> 03:38:55.776]  It happens.
[03:38:55.776 --> 03:38:56.557]  It's happened.
[03:38:56.557 --> 03:38:59.517]  It's going to keep happening.
[03:38:59.517 --> 03:39:02.598]  So we'll see where this goes.
[03:39:02.598 --> 03:39:07.619]  Compromises are often made and then the stock market comes back up again.
[03:39:07.619 --> 03:39:09.459]  Is that going to happen here?
[03:39:09.459 --> 03:39:10.960]  We don't know.
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:16.581]  But Goldman Sachs is, to a degree, running the show.
[03:39:16.581 --> 03:39:20.422]  And that is a globalist show.
[03:39:20.422 --> 03:39:21.262]  On the other hand,
[03:39:22.228 --> 03:39:38.097]  Trump has pointed out, and other people have pointed out too, trade wars, disagreements now between countries about who's going to lay tariffs on which products, etc., etc.
[03:39:38.097 --> 03:39:41.599]  Is that a desperate, horrible thing that signals the end of the world?
[03:39:41.599 --> 03:39:43.380]  No, not at all.
[03:39:43.380 --> 03:39:51.244]  It's all part of a process of sorting out the ruinous, globalist economic policies
[03:39:52.202 --> 03:39:58.943]  of decades in America and other nations that have torpedoed their economies.
[03:39:58.943 --> 03:40:10.786]  There has to be a reshuffling of trade agreements so that the industrial companies do not take the short end of the stick.
[03:40:10.786 --> 03:40:13.527]  You want to call that trade wars?
[03:40:13.527 --> 03:40:19.948]  Yeah, you could promote that and of course the pundits in the mainstream press and the financial sold-out
[03:40:21.078 --> 03:40:26.139]  Pawns called financial reporters are slanting the story that way.
[03:40:26.139 --> 03:40:28.540]  Oh, oh, the trade wars are coming.
[03:40:28.540 --> 03:40:31.060]  The trade wars are coming.
[03:40:31.060 --> 03:40:37.042]  A reshuffling could be coming, which if it does is a very good thing.
[03:40:37.042 --> 03:40:46.404]  To put back on track sane economic policies that have to do with tariffs and fairness in trade.
[03:40:47.253 --> 03:41:05.690]  So that America and other industrialized countries are not just absorbing, absorbing, absorbing and letting corporations flee to far-flung areas where they produce products for virtually nothing.
[03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:12.416]  Okay, grab on to that story, research it, investigate it, dig into it, because you're going to see
[03:41:14.361 --> 03:41:29.614]  That in the mainstream lying fake news press, it's all the time, every day, everywhere, the performance of the stock market is the performance of the economy.
[03:41:29.614 --> 03:41:31.475]  Total BS.
[03:41:31.475 --> 03:41:33.917]  Total lie.
[03:41:33.917 --> 03:41:40.783]  Aimed at being able to control any president who sits in the White House.
[03:41:40.783 --> 03:41:41.043]  Okay.
[03:41:44.176 --> 03:41:50.718]  I reported on a story some months ago on InfoWars and elsewhere about the next generation of vaccines.
[03:41:50.718 --> 03:41:56.560]  This is crucial to understand because it's proceeding apace.
[03:41:56.560 --> 03:41:58.901]  Clinical studies are underway.
[03:41:58.901 --> 03:42:10.925]  We could soon see some kind of approval for the next generation of vaccines which are going to be far more dangerous.
[03:42:10.925 --> 03:42:11.846]  That's right.
[03:42:11.846 --> 03:42:12.826]  Than what we've got now.
[03:42:13.623 --> 03:42:15.572]  Stay with me after the break.
[03:42:15.572 --> 03:42:17.842]  I'll go into it John Rappaport for InfoWars.
[03:42:40.874 --> 03:42:41.675]  I'm so excited.
[03:42:41.675 --> 03:42:51.821]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:42:51.821 --> 03:42:57.325]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:42:57.325 --> 03:43:00.327]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:43:00.327 --> 03:43:09.113]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:43:11.209 --> 03:43:21.471]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:43:21.471 --> 03:43:30.793]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:43:30.793 --> 03:43:33.454]  It is amazing!
[03:43:33.454 --> 03:43:38.435]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:43:40.253 --> 03:43:51.696]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[03:43:51.696 --> 03:43:59.198]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[03:43:59.198 --> 03:44:09.100]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in floralife advanced restoration.
[03:44:09.580 --> 03:44:14.603]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife everyday maintenance.
[03:44:14.603 --> 03:44:24.890]  But all of these are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[03:44:24.890 --> 03:44:30.274]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[03:44:30.754 --> 03:44:39.770]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:44:41.363 --> 03:44:49.345]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:49.345 --> 03:44:55.987]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:44:55.987 --> 03:45:04.269]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:45:04.569 --> 03:45:10.430]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:45:10.430 --> 03:45:13.571]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:45:13.571 --> 03:45:19.653]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:45:19.653 --> 03:45:20.433]  It works.
[03:45:20.433 --> 03:45:28.875]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[03:45:28.875 --> 03:45:29.835]  Defender body armor
[03:45:32.076 --> 03:45:44.298]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:45:44.298 --> 03:45:48.499]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:45:48.499 --> 03:45:55.201]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:45:55.201 --> 03:45:58.962]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:45:59.662 --> 03:46:19.733]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:19.733 --> 03:46:23.275]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:23.835 --> 03:46:35.083]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:35.083 --> 03:46:43.750]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:46.452]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:04.150 --> 03:47:09.953]  John Rappaport in our last segment, the fourth hour sitting in for Alex.
[03:47:09.953 --> 03:47:20.697]  You know, it occurs to me that today's know-nothing rebels underline know-nothing.
[03:47:20.697 --> 03:47:24.119]  Know-nothing.
[03:47:24.119 --> 03:47:33.023]  Their fathers and their mothers, some of them, and their grandparents were the ones back in the 60s and 70s that were saying,
[03:47:34.310 --> 03:47:37.613]  Never trust the government.
[03:47:37.613 --> 03:47:41.216]  Never trust the government.
[03:47:41.216 --> 03:47:56.107]  And now, whether these know-nothing rebels know it or not, they are protesting and rioting and trying to suppress free speech on behalf of the government.
[03:47:56.107 --> 03:47:59.830]  They are the ultimate government trusters.
[03:47:59.830 --> 03:48:02.392]  They're putting all their eggs in that basket.
[03:48:02.392 --> 03:48:03.393]  That's where they're going.
[03:48:03.971 --> 03:48:07.333]  And they somehow think of this as a rebellion.
[03:48:07.333 --> 03:48:08.594]  Really now?
[03:48:08.594 --> 03:48:09.594]  Really?
[03:48:09.594 --> 03:48:13.597]  How ignorant can you possibly get?
[03:48:13.597 --> 03:48:17.359]  How ignorant can you possibly get?
[03:48:17.359 --> 03:48:29.546]  And in fact, if you look at various shows on television that are trying to parody truth tellers, independent media people, etc.
[03:48:29.546 --> 03:48:29.906]  these days,
[03:48:32.188 --> 03:48:36.170]  They usually bring this factor up, you see.
[03:48:36.170 --> 03:48:46.594]  They have their version of the independent media truth teller saying, don't trust the government, folks.
[03:48:46.594 --> 03:48:51.316]  As if, well, now we know that he's completely crazy.
[03:48:51.316 --> 03:48:56.218]  Now we know that he's trying to lead people down the wrong path.
[03:48:56.218 --> 03:49:00.500]  Now we know that he's lying.
[03:49:01.321 --> 03:49:10.108]  Falsifying because, above all, the righteous path is to trust the government.
[03:49:10.108 --> 03:49:12.770]  Really now, is that right?
[03:49:12.770 --> 03:49:14.672]  Is that right?
[03:49:14.672 --> 03:49:28.583]  You can read two, three, four hundred books written out of the 1960s and 70s and 80s by defectors and whistleblowers and so forth and so on, that all carry the same explosive message.
[03:49:29.170 --> 03:49:38.735]  Based on my experience and what I discovered when I was working for this agency or that agency is don't trust the government.
[03:49:38.735 --> 03:49:43.217]  Whatever you do, don't trust the government.
[03:49:43.217 --> 03:49:50.120]  But this is now, well, he might be a terrorist because he's saying don't trust the government.
[03:49:50.120 --> 03:49:52.901]  Where did that equation come from?
[03:49:52.901 --> 03:49:56.123]  Where did that equation come from?
[03:49:56.123 --> 03:49:56.603]  Let's see.
[03:49:57.725 --> 03:50:06.026]  If he says don't trust the government, gee, he's right next door on the verge of becoming a terrorist.
[03:50:06.026 --> 03:50:19.829]  So that would be Jefferson, Madison, Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, and the rest of the people who participated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[03:50:19.829 --> 03:50:27.090]  Because strangely enough, you know, as it turns out, they didn't trust the government.
[03:50:29.005 --> 03:50:30.486]  No, no, that's right.
[03:50:30.486 --> 03:50:31.366]  They didn't.
[03:50:31.366 --> 03:50:32.806]  They didn't trust the government.
[03:50:32.806 --> 03:50:35.648]  They had experience with European governments.
[03:50:35.648 --> 03:50:55.175]  And when they founded this one, they said, the core principle has to be, has to be severely limiting the reach and the power and the potential oppression of centralized power, meaning the new federal government.
[03:50:58.280 --> 03:51:01.483]  They didn't trust central government.
[03:51:01.483 --> 03:51:04.485]  That's why they founded the American Republic.
[03:51:04.485 --> 03:51:07.168]  So I guess that made them terrorists too, obviously.
[03:51:07.168 --> 03:51:08.169]  Well, sure.
[03:51:08.169 --> 03:51:16.836]  Just a bunch of terrorists, you know, flinging words around and... What good are they?
[03:51:16.836 --> 03:51:20.199]  That would be the conclusion.
[03:51:20.199 --> 03:51:20.740]  Today, in 2018,
[03:51:23.041 --> 03:51:45.088]  The FBI arrested the reincarnation of James Madison and put him in prison awaiting trial for acts of terrorism, namely the framing of a document called the Constitution, which formed something called the American Republic.
[03:51:45.088 --> 03:51:51.450]  Madison is certainly going to serve a long term in prison, at the very least.
[03:51:53.089 --> 03:51:55.732]  That would be the judgment.
[03:51:55.732 --> 03:52:12.312]  So let's take a sharp turn here and go to technocracy, which is one of the great arms of the current oppression, oligarchical oppression of human life, dedicated to central power.
[03:52:13.684 --> 03:52:19.348]  Central power, central government, such a degree that it rules the entire planet as if it's one nation.
[03:52:19.348 --> 03:52:28.796]  And I'm talking about the next generation of vaccines, which are called DNA vaccines, and they are currently being studied in clinical trials.
[03:52:28.796 --> 03:52:36.241]  And soon you could see the approval of the first of these DNA vaccines.
[03:52:36.241 --> 03:52:38.443]  In brief, this is what they do.
[03:52:40.712 --> 03:52:51.138]  Genes are synthesized and then injected into the body, carried by viruses.
[03:52:51.138 --> 03:53:03.585]  It's like, let's load these synthetic genes on this little airplane called a virus, shoot it into the body because we have decided that it will protect this person against
[03:53:04.292 --> 03:53:06.253]  Disease X, whatever it is.
[03:53:06.253 --> 03:53:09.814]  This is a major breakthrough in the next generation of vaccines.
[03:53:09.814 --> 03:53:18.197]  Well, we already know that the globalist program of vaccination worldwide has been exposed many, many, many times.
[03:53:18.197 --> 03:53:20.298]  And we're not on the defense in this.
[03:53:20.298 --> 03:53:22.579]  We are on the offense.
[03:53:22.579 --> 03:53:27.881]  These products are incredibly toxic and harmful to human life.
[03:53:27.881 --> 03:53:29.121]  Period.
[03:53:29.121 --> 03:53:31.882]  They have no basis in scientific knowledge.
[03:53:32.777 --> 03:53:40.301]  In the way that they are supposed to be acting to create immunity, and they are a gigantic toxic hoax.
[03:53:40.301 --> 03:53:43.723]  So the next generation is even going to be worse.
[03:53:43.723 --> 03:53:50.166]  Because do you know what's going to happen when these genes are injected into the human body?
[03:53:50.166 --> 03:53:52.247]  These synthetic genes?
[03:53:52.247 --> 03:54:02.252]  They are going to form a new part of an individual's permanent genetic makeup.
[03:54:03.260 --> 03:54:07.021]  Permanent genetic makeup.
[03:54:07.021 --> 03:54:14.784]  Not just a visit, a resident, the man who came to dinner and never left.
[03:54:14.784 --> 03:54:21.346]  That's the way this whole operation is supposed to work.
[03:54:21.346 --> 03:54:27.568]  I cited, when I first started writing about this, an article in the New York Times that just openly admitted the whole thing.
[03:54:29.125 --> 03:54:34.449]  And they decided to get a comment on this from a Nobel Prize winner named David Baltimore, and they said, what do you think of this?
[03:54:34.449 --> 03:54:36.190]  He said, oh yeah, sure, uh-huh.
[03:54:36.190 --> 03:54:49.520]  He said, but, you know, it wouldn't be surprising if some people objected to the idea of permanently altering their DNA.
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:50.481]  Really?
[03:54:50.481 --> 03:54:51.802]  You think so, huh?
[03:54:51.802 --> 03:54:54.484]  You think that might happen when people become aware that
[03:54:56.286 --> 03:55:16.700]  Just over the hill approaching us is purportedly the next generation of vaccines which are DNA altering on a permanent basis with no guarantee, by the way, no guarantee, absolutely, that these vaccines will do anything to create immunity.
[03:55:16.700 --> 03:55:19.322]  That will be the selling point.
[03:55:19.322 --> 03:55:20.523]  That's what will be told.
[03:55:21.318 --> 03:55:25.441]  Oh, this is a fantastic advance over the older forms of vaccination and so forth.
[03:55:25.441 --> 03:55:27.462]  As good as they were, mind you.
[03:55:27.462 --> 03:55:28.563]  Oh, yeah.
[03:55:28.563 --> 03:55:29.824]  This is much better.
[03:55:29.824 --> 03:55:30.785]  It's much cleaner.
[03:55:30.785 --> 03:55:33.207]  It's much safer, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:55:33.207 --> 03:55:37.870]  Of course, there is this one little factor, you know.
[03:55:37.870 --> 03:55:45.675]  We we pretty much need to tell you this, and that is that your DNA is going to be permanently altered.
[03:55:45.675 --> 03:55:50.459]  And since that's the case, then you will be passing down
[03:55:51.394 --> 03:56:00.536]  This altered configuration of your own genetic makeup to the next generation and so on and so forth.
[03:56:00.536 --> 03:56:10.959]  And that will be true for every human on the planet who receives this innovative new type of vaccine.
[03:56:10.959 --> 03:56:13.359]  So what are they saying, basically?
[03:56:13.359 --> 03:56:19.221]  They're saying, we're here to alter your DNA.
[03:56:19.221 --> 03:56:19.521]  That's it.
[03:56:21.163 --> 03:56:27.785]  You know, if you want to just reduce it down to the bare bones of what they're saying, that's it.
[03:56:27.785 --> 03:56:31.787]  Hi, we're the experts and we're here to alter your DNA.
[03:56:31.787 --> 03:56:33.167]  No problem, right?
[03:56:33.167 --> 03:56:36.988]  You don't have a problem with this, do you?
[03:56:36.988 --> 03:56:40.150]  Well, actually, I do.
[03:56:40.150 --> 03:56:40.990]  Actually, I do.
[03:56:42.908 --> 03:56:45.830]  I don't think anybody should be able to alter my DNA.
[03:56:45.830 --> 03:57:06.260]  In fact, these heralded ethicists, you know, in modern medicine, who argue and debate in journals and talk about the dangers of this and that and the other thing, why aren't they up on their hind legs screaming and yelling from rooftops, hey, they're going to alter your DNA.
[03:57:06.260 --> 03:57:07.721]  That's our last segment, folks.
[03:57:07.721 --> 03:57:09.942]  Good to be back here at InfoWars.
