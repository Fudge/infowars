[00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:27.836]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.718]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:47.070]  Well, I'm getting hundreds of phone calls and thousands of emails of support from listeners after the false charges attacks, kind of following the whole Me Too movement, have finally been leveled against us because they finally found some folks that would bear false witness.
[00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.151]  And I feel really good.
[00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:54.214]  I feel honored to be in this position, to be attacked by Hillary Clinton and by her lawyer.
[00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.036]  That's who's filed this suit.
[00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:59.118]  And I know the truth is going to come out because
[00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:06.201]  We just so happen to have documented, because we figured this was going on, in the closing days before these individuals left.
[00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:09.462]  So, they have certainly stepped in a bear trap.
[00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:13.884]  But first, let's go to this critical report, and we'll be back with, has Trump betrayed the Second Amendment?
[00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:17.705]  There have been shootings where, clearly, people do it by themselves.
[00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:22.667]  There's also shootings, where I can play a CNN clip, where, well, more cops got shot.
[00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:24.548]  They need to do more to stop police violence.
[00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:25.489]  That's why they're getting killed.
[00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:26.669]  You know, they deserve it.
[00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.690]  When Congressman Scalise got shot.
[00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:32.979]  Well, Blitzer had a guest on, going, well, the guy was a hero that did it.
[00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.880]  You know, he wasn't a bad guy.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.382]  And Blitzer's like, OK, I agree, yeah.
[00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:39.046]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:43.851]  That he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics that are going on.
[00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:46.294]  That's what we just heard.
[00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:49.057]  Perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics.
[00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:51.420]  The day of the event, we start seeing
[00:01:53.015 --> 00:02:05.719]  Local stations and Texas stations that were there to cover Major League Baseball interviewing students going there's multiple shooters and Cruz was with me he wasn't shooting and then I get a guest on they say it he knows other people we get in contact with say it.
[00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.460]  Imagine then you don't cover it because you don't want to be called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.783]  That just means going and talking to the locals and seeing what really happened instead of whatever the national news in DC or New York or LA says.
[00:02:20.143 --> 00:02:20.943]  And that's what's crazy.
[00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:23.304]  But see, they can't say, oh, Jones is bad.
[00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:29.287]  He interviewed students that said there were multiple shooters and showed local newscasts saying the same thing, and that the sheriff stood down.
[00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:30.107]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:31.427]  You can't go up against that.
[00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:37.250]  So you go, Alex Jones is to be banned on YouTube, Google, thank God.
[00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.371]  Washington Times said, thank God.
[00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:40.571]  Glenn Beck says, thank God.
[00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.152]  News Corp says, thank God.
[00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:43.212]  Let's go ahead and go to Glenn Beck.
[00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:47.874]  Washed up, half his audience, Democrat operative, Judas Gob.
[00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.111]  He goes and falls on his sword on mainstream media.
[00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:51.651]  That's what he does.
[00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.072]  He goes and falls on his sword.
[00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:55.713]  He gets pushed by Twitter, Facebook, everybody, force-fed.
[00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:58.774]  Lavish with corporate sponsorship.
[00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:02.176]  He goes on, falls on his sword, says conservatives is a fraud, as he does.
[00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:04.837]  And then he misrepresents what I said about 9-11, about everything.
[00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:09.860]  Because I said there was a stand-down, Saudi Arabia, all that's come out in the 28 pages.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.361]  But he misrepresents that, and then he misrepresents the rest.
[00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:12.641]  Here it is.
[00:03:13.663 --> 00:03:23.758]  We're frequently accused of spreading conspiracy theories about Obama and about liberals, which is why I want to know what you make of the conspiracy theories this week, these attacks against the students in Florida.
[00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.603]  Why do people embrace this kind of conspiracy theory thinking?
[00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:34.306]  Okay, so let's talk about conspiracy theories, because again, this is a left and right kind of thing.
[00:03:34.326 --> 00:03:35.347]  Look at the congressmanship.
[00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:52.379]  If you remember, Scripps Howard did a poll in 2006, and they asked the question, how likely is it that people in the federal government either assisted in the 9-11 attacks or took no action because they wanted war in the Middle East?
[00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.220]  22% said, very likely.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.181]  22% of Democrats said, very likely.
[00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:01.663]  28% said, somewhat likely.
[00:04:01.963 --> 00:04:08.506]  So that's more than half of Democrats thought that Bush was involved in the 9-11 conspiracy.
[00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:18.070]  So conspiracy, and by the way, the person who was behind that conspiracy is the same guy behind a lot of these conspiracies, Alex Jones.
[00:04:19.457 --> 00:04:22.199]  And then they can't actually say, we need to shut it down.
[00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.582]  They played local newscasts saying multiple shooters, and the police stood down.
[00:04:26.202 --> 00:04:28.384]  And they're also saying CNN had fake town halls.
[00:04:28.744 --> 00:04:29.585]  That's confirmed.
[00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:31.206]  And the crowd goes, burn her!
[00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:31.806]  Burn her!
[00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:33.047]  Of hand-picked people!
[00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:35.849]  They're saying, kill the NRA!
[00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:36.670]  Burn people!
[00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.390]  Murder them!
[00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.831]  Shoot them!
[00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:38.972]  They're murderers!
[00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:46.157]  And all we're doing is going, gee, they all admit they're in an ad thing, and they're all in PR, and they admit that in BuzzFeed.
[00:04:46.177 --> 00:04:47.038]  And it's like, shut up!
[00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.319]  You said that no one died!
[00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.071]  It's like I say, you know, I want to live like Venezuela.
[00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.092]  Shut up, you're a Nazi!
[00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:54.033]  You want to live under Hitler!
[00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:55.934]  I'm like, no, I said I want to live under communism.
[00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:58.217]  So see, they always play these games.
[00:04:59.358 --> 00:05:02.420]  And only because we're not paying attention do they keep having success.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.401]  But they're starting to lose.

[00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:19.373]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:41.227]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:41.907 --> 00:06:44.149]  And I've got a lot of news to cover today.
[00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:53.954]  We've got the mainstream media launching their big fake news story, trying to take me down with absolute fake headlines about Alex Jones accused of sexual assault.
[00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:59.477]  And Alex Jones accused of grooming male and female employees for sex.
[00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:04.420]  And Alex Jones accused of his office having Nazi tennis shoes.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:14.548]  I mean, and it's Hillary Rodham Clinton's former lawyer that's filed all this, and I feel really good about this.
[00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:30.721]  I feel bad for the people that got induced to say these things, and I feel bad for some of the crew that got put into the whole timeline to make it sound more plausible as, I guess, kind of extras in the whole fiction production, but I actually feel really good about this because
[00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.335]  They went over the top.
[00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:35.116]  They've been off way more than they can chew.
[00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:37.457]  And we've got amazing documentation.
[00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.878]  But I'm going to leave a lot of that for court.
[00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:48.582]  But coming up towards the bottom of the hour, I'm going to make a statement on this and go through some of the facts.
[00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:50.283]  Before we go any further,
[00:07:51.857 --> 00:07:53.638]  People are going crazy.
[00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:58.080]  Is Trump getting ready to gut the Second Amendment?
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.584]  And he's made some statements that I don't like, and I've been saying this for about a week, and the statements are getting worse and worse and worse, but...
[00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:16.932]  We've seen this tactic before from the president to sound reasonable, knowing the Democrats will put forward a bill calling for total gun ban, just like they did with the whole DREAM Act.
[00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:19.253]  And so I think that's what Trump's doing.
[00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:19.993]  That's why they hate him.
[00:08:20.013 --> 00:08:20.833]  That's why they want to remove him.
[00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:23.494]  Probably trying to destroy anybody that's connected to him.
[00:08:24.014 --> 00:08:30.056]  But I thought, since I mentioned this report yesterday, that I would go to this now, at least part of it.
[00:08:31.087 --> 00:08:40.190]  It's been edited together by some great folks called Galactic Service on YouTube, taking an interview I did with Joe Rogan a year ago and putting it together.
[00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:45.132]  And now everything that I talked about in there is what Elon Musk is talking about.
[00:08:45.152 --> 00:08:46.713]  It's in the New York Times today.
[00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:50.414]  The sublime and the scary future of cameras with AI brains.
[00:08:51.274 --> 00:08:52.314]  Cameras hooked to AI.
[00:08:52.355 --> 00:08:54.135]  They're already all hooked into the Google and the rest of it.
[00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:54.795]  That is AI.
[00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.277]  This is what the globalists believe.
[00:08:58.378 --> 00:09:02.661]  They believe that they're doing this whole off-world situation and all this craziness.
[00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.324]  And just a year ago it sounded crazy, now it's mainstream news.
[00:09:06.624 --> 00:09:08.026]  I thought I'd play an excerpt of this.
[00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:10.107]  Here it is from the Joe Rogan experience.
[00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:12.429]  I want to tell you guys the big enchilada.
[00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:12.830]  Okay, that's it.
[00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.630]  Please, the big enchilada.
[00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.531]  Do I have to wear these headphones?
[00:09:15.512 --> 00:09:16.793]  What do you know about aliens?
[00:09:17.013 --> 00:09:17.754]  Are aliens real?
[00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:18.795]  This is really big.
[00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:19.851]  So.
[00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:20.511]  Okay.
[00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:23.053]  The question is, what does Donald Trump know about aliens?
[00:09:23.113 --> 00:09:24.453]  Oh yeah, what does he know now, right?
[00:09:24.473 --> 00:09:25.354]  Because he's in the office.
[00:09:26.074 --> 00:09:26.734]  I don't know.
[00:09:26.835 --> 00:09:28.896]  That would be the first thing I did.
[00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:32.317]  I would run to the office and I'd go, who's got the alien documents?
[00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:33.098]  Who's got them?
[00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:34.918]  Alright, let me give you my best, please.
[00:09:35.439 --> 00:09:36.879]  Deep research and proclamation.
[00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:37.580]  Are you ready?
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:38.800]  Yes!
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.021]  I'm going to give you the biggest fallout.
[00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:41.902]  Joe, there are aliens in this room right now.
[00:09:42.243 --> 00:09:42.623]  For real?
[00:09:42.903 --> 00:09:44.044]  Yeah, you're not of this world, bro.
[00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:44.344]  Me?
[00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.145]  You're the alien.
[00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.225]  Oh, wow.
[00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:46.726]  I didn't know.
[00:09:47.226 --> 00:09:48.347]  Well, here's what the elite believe.
[00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:50.728]  And let me be very clear, because the media will take this out of context.
[00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:52.289]  I only go with what I can prove.
[00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.210]  Oh, thank you.
[00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.351]  And people can't even handle that.
[00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:55.271]  There's armies.
[00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:57.013]  We're fighting a pedophile conspiracy.
[00:09:57.313 --> 00:10:03.917]  But beyond that, it's a vampire conspiracy in that they are interdimensionally sucking the essence of our youth.
[00:10:04.257 --> 00:10:04.478]  Right.
[00:10:04.618 --> 00:10:07.199]  And they believe they're possessed by an off-world entity.
[00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:07.620]  They do?
[00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:10.723]  Yeah, and Joe, I've been on air 22 years.
[00:10:10.763 --> 00:10:13.868]  I don't get into aliens, metaphysical, religion, any of that.
[00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:23.441]  I've studied the elite, and I've also communicated with a lot of the top people, and if you want to know, I will actually break down right now the best knowledge right now on what's happening on the planet.
[00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:24.222]  What's happening?
[00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:30.933]  The elite are all about transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the universe and they want to know all this.
[00:10:30.973 --> 00:10:32.734]  Some are good, some are bad, some are a mix.
[00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:35.556]  But the good ones don't ever want to organize.
[00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:38.237]  The bad ones didn't want to organize because they lost after power.
[00:10:38.697 --> 00:10:41.398]  Powerful consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people.
[00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:45.620]  They want to empower them so they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.421]  Then they come together.
[00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:48.742]  Evil is always defeated because good is so much stronger.
[00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:55.063]  And we're on this planet, and Einstein's physics showed it, Max Planck's physics showed it, oh, there's at least 12 dimensions.
[00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:59.645]  And now that's why all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out saying, it's a false hologram.
[00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.325]  It is artificial.
[00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:09.807]  The computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity's bleeding in to this universe.
[00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:11.268]  That's what they call dark matter.
[00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:18.142]  So we're like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in some computer program, some God's mind, whatever.
[00:11:18.462 --> 00:11:19.223]  They're proving it all.
[00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:19.864]  It's all coming out.
[00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:28.132]  Now, there's like this sub-transmission zone below the third dimension that's just turned over the most horrible things is what it resonates to.
[00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:34.919]  And it's trying to get up into the third dimension that's just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.965]  And our species is already way up in the fifth, sixth dimension, consciously, our best people.
[00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:48.834]  But there's this big war trying to, like, basically destroy humanity, because humanity has free will, and there's a decision to which level we want to go to.
[00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:52.078]  We have free will, so evil's allowed to come and contend, and not just good.
[00:11:53.317 --> 00:12:18.898]  And the elites themselves believe they're racing or using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge with machines, transcend, and break away from the failed species that is man, which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad, projecting it onto themselves instead of believing, no, it's a human test about building us up.
[00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:22.300]  And so, Google was set up 18, 19 years ago.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.981]  I knew about this before it was declassified.
[00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:25.142]  I'm just saying I have good sources.
[00:12:25.762 --> 00:12:28.444]  That they wanted to build a giant artificial system.
[00:12:28.924 --> 00:12:41.372]  And Google believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired into it with the Internet of S**t.
[00:12:42.132 --> 00:12:57.296]  And so all of our thoughts go into it, and we're actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also psychically connected to us, that are organic creatures, so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers, a true crystal ball.
[00:12:57.556 --> 00:13:05.359]  But the big secret is, once you have a crystal ball and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future.
[00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:09.760]  And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals, as we know,
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:34.331]  And a true 2.0 in a very bad way, hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us, not in some PKD wirehead system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to the system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system.
[00:13:34.651 --> 00:13:50.705]  There's now a human counter-strike taking place to shut this off before it gets fully into place, and to block these systems, and to try to have an actual debate about where humanity goes, and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are in control of this AI system before humanity is destroyed.
[00:13:50.905 --> 00:13:52.246]  How'd the pedophiles get in control of AI?
[00:13:52.266 --> 00:14:01.714]  Well, the pedophiles, at whatever level, the devil, whatever you want to call it, this inter-dimensional thing that gives them advanced off-world technology, the fallen one, the son of this world, is giving them advanced knowledge.
[00:14:01.954 --> 00:14:02.715]  What are you talking about?
[00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:03.055]  What is that?
[00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:03.175]  What?
[00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:03.676]  Is that Satan?
[00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:04.096]  That's Satan.
[00:14:04.116 --> 00:14:04.376]  That's Satan.
[00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.571]  Where are you getting this from?
[00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:55.814]  Where it's what every culture already said, what everybody already knew, what they're telling you in movies like Prometheus, what the elite admit in the New York Times they believe in.
[00:14:55.954 --> 00:15:10.201]  Everything they're doing points towards this, and then you read their own writings, they believe we're this ugly fallen, ugly species, we're only to be killed, they're the rich billionaires who are better than us, and they're going to merge with machines and become gods and go to the next level.
[00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:11.721]  Here's what I'm telling you.
[00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:17.702]  The elite literally believe, inter-dimensionally, they were given this information and then built it.
[00:15:17.742 --> 00:15:18.282]  And here's the thing.
[00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:19.322]  They built it.
[00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:30.504]  And Google admits, even at data dumps to Wired two years ago, that they're building an AI that will end human consciousness, free will, and take over, and the next species will rise out of that.
[00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:31.164]  They built it.
[00:15:31.244 --> 00:15:35.805]  There's a centralized system of what they're building that isn't naturally occurring.
[00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:36.265]  Who is that?
[00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:40.226]  I mean, if you actually read what all the globalists say, they are getting... Oh, stop right there.
[00:15:40.646 --> 00:15:42.568]  There's about four minutes left in the clip.
[00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:43.409]  It's online.
[00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:46.412]  Alex Jones talks about intergalactic, interdimensional war.
[00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:48.955]  And it breaks it all down.
[00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:49.836]  This is why they hate us.
[00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:50.998]  It's why they want to shut us down.
[00:15:51.598 --> 00:15:53.240]  This is why they want to end the broadcast.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.421]  I'm bringing everybody together.
[00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:57.605]  That's why they're calling me a racist and a rapist and everything else.
[00:15:57.985 --> 00:15:59.407]  It's because they're raping your mind.
[00:16:03.188 --> 00:16:04.809]  You think our information's hardcore?
[00:16:05.169 --> 00:16:06.430]  You think our focus is brutal?
[00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:08.212]  Try our nutraceuticals.

[00:16:44.511 --> 00:16:52.817]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[00:16:53.037 --> 00:17:01.783]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:03.904 --> 00:17:22.989]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:24.789]  It is amazing!

[00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:27.589]  Thank you.

[00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:34.493]  The Super Blue is awesome.
[00:18:35.053 --> 00:18:38.034]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:18:38.074 --> 00:18:39.055]  They are quality.

[00:18:41.135 --> 00:18:43.857]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:18:44.017 --> 00:18:44.437]  Absolutely.
[00:18:45.078 --> 00:18:58.016]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back.
[00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:08.692]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:12.415]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.

[00:20:06.548 --> 00:20:09.211]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:31.370]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:36.211]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:20:36.531 --> 00:20:40.993]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:49.336]  Well ladies and gentlemen, all hell is breaking loose.
[00:20:49.396 --> 00:20:54.418]  President Trump has come out making pro-gun control statements.
[00:20:56.192 --> 00:20:57.033]  And I know what he's doing.
[00:20:57.073 --> 00:21:08.341]  He's attempting to neutralize all the hysteria and all the opposition so that he can quote, propose something reasonable, they'll propose something that's draconian, and then nothing gets done.
[00:21:08.842 --> 00:21:11.083]  Just like he did with the whole DREAM Act.
[00:21:11.764 --> 00:21:13.505]  He proposed something that was pretty reasonable.
[00:21:14.046 --> 00:21:16.828]  Okay, 1.8 million people have been here for decades, not criminals.
[00:21:17.428 --> 00:21:18.829]  Okay, fast track to citizenship.
[00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.250]  Everybody else, you're out.
[00:21:20.851 --> 00:21:22.072]  He's done everything he said he would do there.
[00:21:23.078 --> 00:21:29.581]  But now we learn Trump stuns lawmakers with seeming embrace of comprehensive gun control.
[00:21:30.362 --> 00:21:32.183]  And a lot of people are saying they're done with Trump.
[00:21:33.684 --> 00:21:34.864]  His base is really upset.
[00:21:34.904 --> 00:21:37.366]  They're really upset at the NRA for agreeing to bump stocks.
[00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:40.507]  Then it's, oh, up to 21, not able to buy a rifle.
[00:21:41.788 --> 00:21:46.210]  And then it's every time there's going to be another shooting, it's always going to happen out of 330 million people.
[00:21:47.611 --> 00:21:50.312]  Mass shootings are very, very rare, but the media magnifies them.
[00:21:50.332 --> 00:21:51.173]  There's still tragedies.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.742]  You get put in the position of losing your Second Amendment.
[00:21:54.762 --> 00:21:55.682]  Let's call Larry Pratt.
[00:21:55.702 --> 00:21:57.764]  Let's get him on today, of Gun Owners of America.
[00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:01.426]  Because the NRA the last five, six years has been no compromise, and that's been great.
[00:22:02.327 --> 00:22:06.069]  But now, they're really starting to slide because a Republican is in office.
[00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.211]  CNN calls it surreal.
[00:22:09.712 --> 00:22:15.736]  Trump meeting on guns, let Republicans reeling, Democrats optimistic.
[00:22:15.816 --> 00:22:20.499]  And there's this video that we've got of the Democratic senators
[00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:25.121]  Like Feinstein smiling when Trump says this.
[00:22:25.141 --> 00:22:26.002]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[00:22:26.442 --> 00:22:31.625]  Feinstein can't even get the nomination in California.
[00:22:31.905 --> 00:22:34.967]  She can't even get the groups to endorse her to run.
[00:22:35.948 --> 00:22:36.969]  She's so unpopular.
[00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.111]  And there's Trump being buddy-buddy with her.
[00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:41.772]  I believe this is a tactic.
[00:22:42.632 --> 00:22:43.933]  I've seen Trump do it before.
[00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:50.157]  But regardless, he can see where the momentum is going if there's more of these shootings.
[00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.333]  They believe he'll end up losing the election, and will lose 2018.
[00:22:56.094 --> 00:22:56.975]  That is not the case.
[00:22:57.095 --> 00:23:01.518]  It will cause Republicans to desert the party, and will cause the Democrats to have a huge landslide.
[00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:03.020]  Have they gotten to the President?
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.581]  Because let me tell you something, they genuinely hate him.
[00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:06.303]  They hate everybody that ever supported him.
[00:23:07.403 --> 00:23:12.685]  And he's gotten 60 plus percent of his agenda through, I agree with the Heritage Foundation, in just 14 months.
[00:23:12.985 --> 00:23:23.267]  Killing TPP, renegotiating NAFTA and GATT, massively controlling the borders, crushing political correctness, trillions in the stock market, hundreds of billions in new jobs, millions of new jobs.
[00:23:23.648 --> 00:23:35.031]  I mean, I'm not going to list the whole raft again, but Trump, about a hundred and something days in, kind of suddenly veered left for about two months, then veered back
[00:23:36.218 --> 00:24:00.411]  Nationalist and so Trump's smart and so I'm gonna give the benefit of the doubt thank God it's not Hillary but we've got to run good people for Congress run good people for the state houses we've got to just keep moving forward like Trump's gonna turn against us and we've got to start making preparations for that obviously this is a really really sad situation let's go ahead and play Dianne Feinstein the complete
[00:24:01.889 --> 00:24:03.029]  Political dead duck.
[00:24:03.229 --> 00:24:06.190]  I mean, and by that, a lame duck, you know, is going to be out of office soon.
[00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:16.513]  I call a politician that everybody can't stand in their own party, and is hated by the other party, and hated by the people, and who's old and out of touch, and bumbling around, a dead duck, politically.
[00:24:16.773 --> 00:24:17.793]  That's my term I'm coining.
[00:24:18.634 --> 00:24:20.354]  And, or a dead, dead turkey.
[00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:21.234]  Maybe that's a good term.
[00:24:22.535 --> 00:24:24.015]  An old, old rotten turkey.
[00:24:24.055 --> 00:24:24.855]  Maybe that's a better term.
[00:24:25.055 --> 00:24:26.656]  She's a politically rotten turkey.
[00:24:27.534 --> 00:24:28.054]  It's a good term.
[00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:30.515]  Turkey's, you know, something that fails, something that isn't good.
[00:24:31.055 --> 00:24:32.335]  A rotten turkey's really bad.
[00:24:32.355 --> 00:24:34.076]  So Dianne Feinstein is a rotten turkey.
[00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:37.757]  Here she is, smiling like a, you know what, eating rat next to Trump.
[00:24:38.657 --> 00:24:42.218]  So if you could add that to this bill, that would be great, Dianne.
[00:24:42.258 --> 00:24:46.179]  If you could add what you have also, and I think you can, into the bill.
[00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:47.919]  Joe, are you ready?
[00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:48.619]  Can you do that?
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.280]  Joe, can you do that?
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.861]  Pat, can you add some of the things?
[00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:53.781]  You're not going to agree with me, right?
[00:24:53.821 --> 00:24:54.461]  Yeah, if you help.
[00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:58.523]  Well, no, I'll help, but can you add what Amy and what Diane have?
[00:24:58.563 --> 00:24:59.383]  Can we add them in?
[00:24:59.604 --> 00:25:00.784]  And I know you can add what Jones.
[00:25:00.804 --> 00:25:08.208]  Yeah, I have another domestic violence bill that's very narrow and it's about dating partners and a number of states have just enacted it with Republican support.
[00:25:08.228 --> 00:25:08.728]  I would say this.
[00:25:08.748 --> 00:25:09.649]  We're going to get it passed.
[00:25:09.689 --> 00:25:10.809]  We're going to get it passed.
[00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:18.233]  If you can add domestic violence paragraphs, pages into this bill, I'm all for it.
[00:25:19.874 --> 00:25:23.416]  And look at the little corrupt Democrats that lushed after disarming the American people.
[00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:26.837]  Having just criminal looks in their eyes.
[00:25:26.857 --> 00:25:36.141]  Feinstein could be the Wicked Witch of the East in the famous Yellow Brick Road, Wizard of Oz.
[00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:42.544]  In fact, can McBreen or whoever's here in graphics, can we grab this and put her head on the witch riding the bicycle?
[00:25:43.024 --> 00:25:44.285]  Or I'll get you, my pretty!
[00:25:45.005 --> 00:25:48.887]  If you're not a radio listener, can we blow this up for TV viewers?
[00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:50.808]  Can we blow the footage up there?
[00:25:51.408 --> 00:25:52.389]  Yes, blow that up.
[00:25:53.209 --> 00:26:06.744]  And just loop that, just visually, but also with the cackling, uh, she looks like a demon when she did the archetypal, ah, oh, yes, oh, finally, oh, oh, yeah.
[00:26:06.764 --> 00:26:08.767]  Go ahead and roll the audio again, please.
[00:26:10.266 --> 00:26:10.927]  Can you do that?
[00:26:11.587 --> 00:26:12.608]  Joe, can you do that?
[00:26:12.628 --> 00:26:19.094]  Can you add some of the soap, and I think you can, into the milk?
[00:26:19.114 --> 00:26:22.417]  Actually rubbing the hands together, look!
[00:26:23.057 --> 00:26:23.218]  Oh!
[00:26:23.838 --> 00:26:27.762]  Have you ever seen the footage of Hitler and Herman Goering?
[00:26:28.993 --> 00:26:31.854]  They're taking over Czechoslovakia and then France capitulates.
[00:26:32.295 --> 00:26:33.195]  And Hitler's in Germany.
[00:26:33.255 --> 00:26:33.955]  It's newsreel.
[00:26:33.995 --> 00:26:36.156]  He's about to travel by train the next day to Paris.
[00:26:36.637 --> 00:26:44.160]  And him and Herman Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe, big ol' fat Herman Goering, are rubbing their hands together greedily.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.382]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:50.083]  Operation Toto will defeat them.
[00:26:50.103 --> 00:26:51.063]  That's what Infowars is.
[00:26:52.504 --> 00:26:56.066]  But this image right here, this may sink Trump because
[00:26:57.116 --> 00:27:00.460]  The left will never vote for him, even if he became Mao Zedong.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.201]  It's because they're so brainwashed.
[00:27:02.702 --> 00:27:05.465]  And so, I don't know what planet Trump's on.
[00:27:05.485 --> 00:27:08.048]  I don't know if it has to do with the Carter-Page thing.
[00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:15.816]  Because our CIA sources told us last week on air, they were really worried about sex-ops bringing down the president or compromising him.
[00:27:15.836 --> 00:27:17.097]  And they said, that's all we're going to say.
[00:27:17.117 --> 00:27:17.678]  That was pachinko.
[00:27:18.925 --> 00:27:21.527]  Of course, his sources are in the Pentagon and the CIA at the highest levels.
[00:27:22.248 --> 00:27:25.250]  And they said, man, people may get freaked out real soon.
[00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.513]  It looks like they may have all the Stormy Daniels business and all this other stuff.
[00:27:29.953 --> 00:27:31.815]  You know, women got King David in trouble.
[00:27:32.555 --> 00:27:33.576]  He got himself in trouble.
[00:27:34.377 --> 00:27:35.718]  But this is amazing.
[00:27:36.598 --> 00:27:39.481]  But you know, even if you keep your nose clean, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:40.682 --> 00:27:43.424]  Because what's happened to us has come along.
[00:27:43.984 --> 00:27:47.687]  And I'm just glad the case that they cooked up
[00:27:50.074 --> 00:27:54.296]  Is so fraudulent, so ridiculous, so over-the-top.
[00:27:55.557 --> 00:28:03.021]  Newsweek says, Jones is being investigated for sexual assault.
[00:28:04.322 --> 00:28:04.742]  That's right.
[00:28:05.122 --> 00:28:07.924]  Sexual assault and racial discrimination.
[00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:13.387]  She claims, she hugged me once and I touched her side.
[00:28:13.627 --> 00:28:14.267]  Not even true.
[00:28:15.968 --> 00:28:16.528]  Not even true.
[00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:19.600]  And that then turns into sexual assault.
[00:28:20.481 --> 00:28:23.123]  And they claim we wear Nazi shoes with swastikas on them.
[00:28:23.203 --> 00:28:23.863]  I'm not kidding.
[00:28:24.283 --> 00:28:24.964]  Totally false.
[00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:29.106]  And then that we have open carry guns everywhere.
[00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:33.769]  No, sometimes we'll show a rifle on air, but you don't do open carry with handguns in Texas.
[00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:34.390]  That's illegal.
[00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.751]  We have concealed carry here.
[00:28:36.411 --> 00:28:38.432]  And Ashley asked for a concealed carry class.
[00:28:38.772 --> 00:28:41.054]  We have somebody here that works here, went and gave her a class.
[00:28:41.274 --> 00:28:42.035]  We have video of that.
[00:28:42.415 --> 00:28:47.218]  So what I'm saying is every piece, every piece of what they say, we have the opposite.
[00:28:49.036 --> 00:28:53.281]  Except for the one little frame-up part, but then we were able to catch who was behind that as well.
[00:28:54.021 --> 00:28:56.224]  I mean, this is amazing what they've stepped into.
[00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:12.793]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[00:29:13.393 --> 00:29:18.034]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[00:29:18.694 --> 00:29:30.036]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:44.325]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:50.288]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[00:29:50.749 --> 00:29:52.190]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat
[00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:53.890]  A lot of protein.
[00:29:54.411 --> 00:29:55.771]  You don't chew it properly sometimes.
[00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:56.452]  There's buildup.
[00:29:56.472 --> 00:30:00.833]  You can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis, you name it.
[00:30:01.414 --> 00:30:03.775]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[00:30:04.861 --> 00:30:12.345]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[00:30:12.865 --> 00:30:24.832]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[00:30:25.152 --> 00:30:27.694]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[00:30:28.314 --> 00:30:32.298]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[00:30:32.718 --> 00:30:34.560]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:48.853]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Carnivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[00:30:49.073 --> 00:30:52.877]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[00:30:53.217 --> 00:30:55.298]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[00:30:55.658 --> 00:31:00.481]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:03.682]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:05.903]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:06.404 --> 00:31:16.709]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.031]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[00:31:21.158 --> 00:31:33.946]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[00:31:34.547 --> 00:31:43.753]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[00:31:45.262 --> 00:31:47.004]  This is the total win-win.
[00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:53.232]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[00:31:53.793 --> 00:31:58.198]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:02.604]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best
[00:32:03.044 --> 00:32:04.045]  At the lowest price.
[00:32:04.525 --> 00:32:13.933]  Many probiotics out there don't even have caplets that bypass the stomach so it never even gets into the upper and lower intestines.
[00:32:14.514 --> 00:32:21.319]  Both of these systems have targeted delivery so it goes right through into the upper and lower intestine.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:29.746]  We've tried several other formulas that were excellent, but this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[00:32:30.106 --> 00:32:35.790]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:40.934]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[00:32:41.534 --> 00:32:50.561]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[00:32:51.658 --> 00:32:55.380]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:03.403]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:09.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.130]  Big Brother.
[00:33:22.572 --> 00:33:28.036]  We're now 34 minutes in, or 33 minutes in, to the
[00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:57.267]  34-hour live broadcast that we announced we were going to start doing last week, today, on March 1st, 2018.
[00:33:58.007 --> 00:34:04.452]  And it's called Operation Paul Revere 2018 to defend our free speech, to defend the internet, and to defend the Second Amendment.
[00:34:06.374 --> 00:34:09.216]  And boy, is that not more true now today than ever.
[00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:11.798]  Who would have known that this would be the first broadcast day
[00:34:12.944 --> 00:34:24.668]  Where I'd have a chance to respond to thousands of articles, and it's on national television everywhere, headline, Alex Jones accused of sexual assault.
[00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:29.150]  Alex Jones accused of gay grooming.
[00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.892]  Alex Jones accused of threatening people with firearms.
[00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:41.574]  Alex Jones, employees wearing Nazi shoes with swastikas.
[00:34:43.857 --> 00:34:50.078]  The most insane media behavior we've ever seen.
[00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.199]  And then I've got the EEOC twin complaint.
[00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:57.120]  They don't tell you the individuals were in a relationship together.
[00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:06.602]  And then, there's a little thing called evidence.
[00:35:06.622 --> 00:35:07.322]  There's none of that.
[00:35:07.882 --> 00:35:10.023]  And we can sit there and debunk the entire thing.
[00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:18.141]  But our listeners, our supporters don't buy any of it because they know the climate we're in.
[00:35:20.142 --> 00:35:21.123]  They see where we are.
[00:35:21.143 --> 00:35:31.327]  And it's just like the Prairie Home Companion guy where the woman hugged him and his hand supposedly touched her back.
[00:35:31.527 --> 00:35:34.028]  That's what they're calling sex assault.
[00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:41.772]  But the difference is I never even, she was always trying to hug me and I was never letting her do it.
[00:35:42.864 --> 00:35:44.285]  You can ask any employees around here.
[00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:47.027]  I'm not stupid.
[00:35:48.448 --> 00:35:55.193]  And that's why we are getting all the affidavits and we already have the write-ups and the video and the audio and we already have everything.
[00:35:55.273 --> 00:35:55.993]  We're not stupid.
[00:35:57.474 --> 00:35:58.195]  We're not stupid.
[00:35:58.895 --> 00:36:00.556]  And so I actually thank God.
[00:36:00.677 --> 00:36:04.759]  I'm sad for the crew that got falsely accused of stuff just to add to the script that they created.
[00:36:08.905 --> 00:36:10.947]  I mean, you can see how this was written as a script.
[00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:13.570]  The media builds on a script.
[00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:17.214]  I do some ads with my shirt off.
[00:36:17.234 --> 00:36:18.416]  The media makes a big deal about it.
[00:36:18.436 --> 00:36:20.198]  I go on The Young Turks with my shirt off as a joke.
[00:36:20.618 --> 00:36:23.682]  And then it turns into Jones is around the office talking to everyone with his shirt off.
[00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:34.981]  Even though it might be twice a year, you know, that I'm running from a bathroom back to my office to get a shirt or something and I'm, you know, pulling my shirt on for the show if I'm late.
[00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:36.862]  But then that's it.
[00:36:36.922 --> 00:36:45.967]  Like, he patted her on the back and once his shirt was off and they had firearms and he was scared of them and they were all over the place.
[00:36:46.007 --> 00:36:48.429]  Meanwhile, I want to go take a concealed carry course, please.
[00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:52.691]  Here, Ashley, we'll videotape you at your concealed carry wearing InfoWars shirts.
[00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:53.512]  Here, let's put that on screen.
[00:36:56.823 --> 00:37:00.606]  We've got all the audio, we've got all the video, we've got everything debunked.
[00:37:02.167 --> 00:37:04.409]  It's just then, look at that big smile there.
[00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.951]  In the horrible office with the guns.
[00:37:07.532 --> 00:37:10.594]  And the guns are all in instant access, pistol safe, people have concealed carries.
[00:37:11.115 --> 00:37:11.795]  Now we're in Texas.
[00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:15.919]  We're not in North Korea.
[00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:17.740]  But I'm gonna get to that next segment.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.242]  Let me just do this, this segment.
[00:37:20.903 --> 00:37:21.924]  Look at these headlines.
[00:37:23.837 --> 00:37:27.341]  Marie Le Pen, she's set to win the French election in polls.
[00:37:27.902 --> 00:37:30.345]  Criminally charged for anti-ISIS tweets.
[00:37:30.725 --> 00:37:31.927]  She spoke out against ISIS.
[00:37:32.608 --> 00:37:33.209]  That's illegal.
[00:37:34.457 --> 00:37:35.158]  Under French law.
[00:37:35.198 --> 00:37:35.578]  Seriously.
[00:37:35.598 --> 00:37:37.500]  And she's been criminally charged.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.941]  That's at newswars.com.
[00:37:38.961 --> 00:37:39.801]  That ought to shut her up.
[00:37:40.742 --> 00:37:45.246]  China just banned the letter N from the internet because it was being used in a new combination.
[00:37:45.266 --> 00:37:51.591]  Xi Zedong, combining the current dictator with the last dictator, who made himself a dictator of the Communist Party.
[00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:54.834]  He's already a dictator of the party, which is a dictatorship.
[00:37:57.102 --> 00:37:58.024]  So that's been banned.
[00:37:58.124 --> 00:37:59.407]  This is an example of where we are.
[00:37:59.427 --> 00:38:03.435]  And then Trump to take the guns first, go through due process second.
[00:38:03.475 --> 00:38:04.537]  Boy, what a horrible quote.
[00:38:06.104 --> 00:38:10.647]  That's because they didn't go after all the warning signs or follow the law to stop the supposed shooter, Nick Cruz.
[00:38:11.527 --> 00:38:18.471]  And so Trump's just kind of brainstorming for hours, and the media is taking that and making it sound like he's gonna go for all this.
[00:38:18.491 --> 00:38:24.935]  You notice he said, though, you can introduce whatever you want, Dianne Feinstein, into the Republican bill, and we'll see.
[00:38:25.015 --> 00:38:26.115]  You may not get what you want.
[00:38:26.135 --> 00:38:32.479]  The point is, it'll scotch the whole deal, and Trump
[00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:39.009]  We'll look like he was reasonable when he knows it's unreasonable that they just want to incrementally get the guns.
[00:38:39.289 --> 00:38:43.572]  And these idiots just want to score political points and don't know he's playing them like a fiddle.
[00:38:43.932 --> 00:38:45.813]  Now, that's what my gut tells me he's doing.
[00:38:46.113 --> 00:38:49.856]  That's what I've seen him do at least five other cases in the last 14 months.
[00:38:50.456 --> 00:38:55.399]  But let me tell you, I don't think you can play games even rhetorically with the Second Amendment like this.
[00:38:57.614 --> 00:39:01.538]  So I think this is a big miscalculation by the President and I don't like it.
[00:39:01.718 --> 00:39:05.821]  But we are now 38 minutes into Operation Paul Revere 2018.
[00:39:07.603 --> 00:39:12.808]  And I've never gone on air and gone this far, but I'll tell you right now.
[00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:17.712]  I'm proud of the fact we're under attack because I know these are bad people.
[00:39:17.752 --> 00:39:19.614]  Hillary Clinton can't believe she lost the election.
[00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:25.616]  And it's one of her former chief lawyers that is running this whole lawsuit operation.
[00:39:26.656 --> 00:39:32.938]  And he even says in the Daily Mail, he makes political comments about how I'm a bad person that lies to my audience, you know, and how I do these bad things.
[00:39:32.998 --> 00:39:35.938]  And this just adds to how bad I am.
[00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:40.619]  And then the media never even called to get a quote from me.
[00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:42.980]  Because they're not media, they're fake news.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]  But you will hear the truth.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.280]  You will know the truth.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.261]  It's unbelievable.
[00:39:49.662 --> 00:39:52.844]  It's of course, the law firm is the one for Michael Jackson and all of it.
[00:39:54.085 --> 00:39:56.887]  That's been hooked into all that Hollywood stuff.
[00:39:56.967 --> 00:39:57.768]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:06.294]  Speaking of Hollywood, after hashtag MeToo pepper spray to giveaways in the Oscar goodie bags.
[00:40:07.035 --> 00:40:12.899]  Meanwhile, street artist erects three billboards over Hollywood, Oscars for biggest pedophile goes to.
[00:40:12.919 --> 00:40:14.600]  Maybe we should show some of those, uh,
[00:40:15.618 --> 00:40:16.079]  Show some of those.
[00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:23.549]  They're using the Me Too as a distraction from the whole pedophile scandal that we told you was going to break about a year ago and has now broke.
[00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:27.695]  So here's what's happening.
[00:40:29.207 --> 00:40:33.469]  If you support us in this critical fight, we will win and we will take the country back and we'll take the world back.
[00:40:33.489 --> 00:40:37.251]  Because they know they can try to kill the President or impeach him or shut him down.
[00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:41.472]  But they know if there's talk radio, they know if there's Drudge Report, they know if there's Infowars.
[00:40:41.933 --> 00:40:45.334]  They know that we're the hardcore folks that hit the barbed wire.
[00:40:45.734 --> 00:40:46.555]  You hit the barbed wire.
[00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:47.915]  We bring up the hard topics.
[00:40:47.935 --> 00:40:48.616]  We take the heat.
[00:40:49.016 --> 00:40:50.396]  We make it safe for others to say.
[00:40:51.217 --> 00:40:53.158]  We change the discussion onto real issues.
[00:40:54.098 --> 00:40:58.160]  And they've decided that we were critical in losing Hillary the election.
[00:40:58.993 --> 00:41:05.636]  And they have said, Impel Wars is the key, they've decided to destroy us, and they've said if we can bring them down, we'll bring everybody down.
[00:41:06.076 --> 00:41:09.458]  Just like all the headlines saying, ban Jones off the internet entirely.
[00:41:09.758 --> 00:41:11.099]  Don't just ban him off YouTube.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.980]  Kick him off talk radio.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.580]  Arrest him.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.321]  He's a liar.
[00:41:15.381 --> 00:41:16.521]  He doesn't have his free speech.
[00:41:16.821 --> 00:41:18.202]  Then they lie about what I've said.
[00:41:18.282 --> 00:41:20.123]  Even if it was true, I have my free speech.
[00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:24.125]  You have to adjudicate that in a court for defamation, not just say I'm banned.
[00:41:26.129 --> 00:41:27.770]  So, you can pull up the headlines.
[00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.333]  InfoWars is, you know, one step away from being banned on YouTube.
[00:41:33.754 --> 00:41:35.956]  And so, we said this the last few days.
[00:41:35.976 --> 00:41:39.438]  We said, they're getting ready for something big against InfoWars.
[00:41:40.078 --> 00:41:43.100]  Because they're trying to silence us and trying to demonize us.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.683]  And instead of there being a demonization campaign every month and then every week, it's every day.
[00:41:48.404 --> 00:41:50.285]  And now it's every few hours.
[00:41:51.306 --> 00:41:52.827]  And really, I really am honored
[00:41:53.868 --> 00:41:57.530]  To be at this level of demonization and attack, it shows how effective we are.
[00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:02.412]  I think about the soldiers that have fought and died to create this country and then to keep this country.
[00:42:02.732 --> 00:42:05.413]  I think about the wives and families that lost those men and women.
[00:42:05.893 --> 00:42:07.494]  And I think about all my ancestors.
[00:42:07.894 --> 00:42:12.256]  A lot of them were hard-working, really good people, always known as being honorable and straight and strong.
[00:42:12.616 --> 00:42:15.117]  Both sides of my family were known for that genetically and culturally.
[00:42:15.878 --> 00:42:18.579]  But when it comes to fighting tyrants and dying
[00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:21.360]  But changing history, we're all over it.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:27.644]  From 1776 to 1836, right through World War I, World War II, Vietnam, the Cold War.
[00:42:27.744 --> 00:42:28.705]  My family's been there.
[00:42:29.345 --> 00:42:34.609]  Well, sometimes misguided, but fighting for the Republic, fighting for Western culture, fighting for the Renaissance.
[00:42:34.689 --> 00:42:35.969]  And I am very honored.
[00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.551]  I feel for my family and crew around us.
[00:42:38.591 --> 00:42:42.494]  I've warned them about this, that they could be targeted as well to try to bring the place down.
[00:42:42.514 --> 00:42:44.675]  If they can't get me to buckle, they're gonna come after you.
[00:42:45.035 --> 00:42:46.276]  But you're strong, you understand that.
[00:42:46.776 --> 00:42:51.640]  So I trust in God, I trust in our audience, and I trust in Providence to carry us through.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:59.247]  I am extremely honored to be in this position and I commit to you that I will be as strong as I can and stay the course.
[00:42:59.968 --> 00:43:00.628]  Full speed ahead.
[00:43:04.409 --> 00:43:13.078]  My radio program, our TV broadcast, our films are among some of the biggest viral sensations in the last 20 years.
[00:43:13.778 --> 00:43:19.925]  And we're bringing back nationalism, we're bringing back sovereignty, we're bringing back true populism and rule.
[00:43:20.425 --> 00:43:21.987]  For, of, and by the people.
[00:43:22.447 --> 00:43:36.623]  And that's why Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other mainstream media outlets, the modern robber barons of our age, admit, even in congressional hearings and in undercover videos, that the number one enemy to shut down is InfoWars.
[00:43:37.103 --> 00:43:52.058]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live,
[00:43:53.059 --> 00:44:02.545]  The top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror, he was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:44:03.185 --> 00:44:10.490]  This is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:18.875]  How quickly can you act and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[00:44:19.595 --> 00:44:23.198]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience.
[00:44:23.498 --> 00:44:24.599]  The system self-corrected.
[00:44:24.719 --> 00:44:27.561]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:29.823]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:44:31.024 --> 00:44:31.784]  But you saw this?
[00:44:32.024 --> 00:44:32.765]  USA Today.
[00:44:33.165 --> 00:44:34.286]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:44:34.426 --> 00:44:36.007]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:44:37.168 --> 00:44:45.940]  At the very least, we can say that, like, this shelf of videos for news programs is legitimate news because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[00:44:46.761 --> 00:44:51.808]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well...
[00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:54.370]  They were looking for him speaking with anyone.
[00:44:54.751 --> 00:44:56.192]  So they shadow ban our videos.
[00:44:56.232 --> 00:44:57.512]  They block our articles.
[00:44:57.532 --> 00:45:00.695]  They ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[00:45:01.195 --> 00:45:05.518]  That's why it's so essential that you continue to stand in the face of their censorship.
[00:45:05.738 --> 00:45:08.360]  Because if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.782]  But because of their brazenness, it's caused the Streisand effect.
[00:45:13.603 --> 00:45:21.247]  And they're now panicking because their attempts to censor us have only made the message expand and get out in ways it never would have.
[00:45:21.888 --> 00:45:25.550]  So I know a lot of you are smarter than I am, and you've got great, inventive ways to take action.
[00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:35.416]  But however you do it, spreading articles, spreading videos, on your own email list, telling friends and family about the censored information in person, however you do it, calling in to C-SPAN,
[00:45:36.932 --> 00:45:43.484]  Getting on other shows, online, letting them know that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that if we can be censored successfully...
[00:45:44.657 --> 00:45:46.178]  All of you can be censored as well.
[00:45:46.658 --> 00:45:50.300]  So be sure and like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.521]  Be sure to send out the videos, the articles.
[00:45:53.522 --> 00:45:56.543]  Be sure to report on anything we've covered that you think is important.
[00:45:56.743 --> 00:45:59.825]  Feel free to re-upload our videos and post them wherever you like.
[00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:01.606]  All of it is copyright free.
[00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:03.627]  Be sure and click the notifications.
[00:46:04.247 --> 00:46:09.390]  Be sure and subscribe to all of our great channels because we're in a real fight
[00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:09.890]  I think?
[00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.949]  It's evil, and together we're gonna defeat it.
[00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:44.837]  So folks, you have absolutely been the resistance, you have cut through all their propaganda, and because of that I salute you, and I ask you now, more than ever, to redouble your efforts, because if you're watching this transmission and listening, you are the resistance.
[00:46:56.205 --> 00:46:58.087]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:10.734]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.463 --> 00:47:23.464]  You want answers?
[00:47:24.025 --> 00:47:25.146]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:25.846 --> 00:47:30.590]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.754 --> 00:47:44.984]  Well, we knew something big was coming, and it's part of the anti-free speech globalist attack on anyone promoting a constitutional republic, anyone promoting a free society.
[00:47:45.664 --> 00:47:52.510]  We are now 47 minutes into the 34-hour emergency broadcast with my show, David Knight, Owen Schroer, and others.
[00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:57.754]  We're going to be broadcasting right through live until 6 o'clock tomorrow night on Friday.
[00:47:59.346 --> 00:48:01.928]  This is the official launch day.
[00:48:01.948 --> 00:48:05.471]  24 hours a day on Galaxy 16.
[00:48:06.031 --> 00:48:09.574]  We're also on one other big satellite and we're going to be on another one we'll announce the next week.
[00:48:09.874 --> 00:48:12.276]  But today was the day we officially went 24 hours a day on it.
[00:48:12.776 --> 00:48:23.505]  We had this planned for a couple months and notice this is the day they've rolled out with Alex Jones accused of sexual assault, wearing Nazi shoes,
[00:48:25.495 --> 00:48:28.396]  And a bunch of other just completely insane stuff.
[00:48:28.856 --> 00:48:30.856]  And then you actually read the EEOC report.
[00:48:32.916 --> 00:48:35.337]  It says a woman hugged me and I patted her side.
[00:48:36.377 --> 00:48:37.917]  And then that's sexual assault.
[00:48:38.198 --> 00:48:39.438]  And then that didn't even happen.
[00:48:40.338 --> 00:48:44.379]  But see, Newsweek and stuff take the EEOC report and then they don't actually quote it.
[00:48:44.719 --> 00:48:45.839]  They just make stuff up.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.400]  It's incredible.
[00:48:52.932 --> 00:48:55.973]  I'm going to talk about that some, and I've got some guests coming up.
[00:48:58.473 --> 00:49:00.614]  But there's all this other news, and here I am again.
[00:49:00.634 --> 00:49:02.214]  I never plug hardly in the first hour.
[00:49:02.254 --> 00:49:03.174]  I hardly ever talk about it.
[00:49:03.474 --> 00:49:09.155]  That's what the 34-hour broadcast is about, is to deal with all the other lawsuits.
[00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:10.956]  And here's the good news.
[00:49:11.256 --> 00:49:14.796]  The Democrat-affiliated groups have filed eight lawsuits on me.
[00:49:15.717 --> 00:49:19.557]  Well, this will be nine in the last 14 months since Trump won.
[00:49:20.478 --> 00:49:22.178]  The lawsuit started the week after he won.
[00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:26.842]  So I guess it's about 16, 17 months ago.
[00:49:27.823 --> 00:49:29.706]  And they're so frivolous they get thrown out.
[00:49:30.027 --> 00:49:30.868]  They're trying to break us.
[00:49:30.888 --> 00:49:31.669]  They think we're going to give up.
[00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:39.642]  We just lawyered up and negotiated good deals with lawyers and have got it covered as long as you financially support us.
[00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:52.409]  I won't have money to fight all this and launch these satellites that have affiliate relations with cable and TV stations that are picking us up like wildfire, because their attempts to shut us down has really woken up station owners and managers and program directors.
[00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.369]  We're just exploding on television.
[00:49:54.729 --> 00:50:05.273]  We are not listing affiliates at this time, because the affiliates appreciate that, because then they get targeted and, you know, some but what a rass, but that's way outweighed by all the positive support they get.
[00:50:08.592 --> 00:50:13.453]  We're offering the biggest savings ever at InfoWarsTore.com to make it easy to support the broadcast.
[00:50:13.733 --> 00:50:17.675]  We also have a donate button we put on the front page of InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:50:18.135 --> 00:50:19.755]  We're also going to have a pop-up that pops up.
[00:50:19.775 --> 00:50:20.836]  We don't usually have those on the site.
[00:50:20.856 --> 00:50:22.236]  We're going to have a pop-up the next few days.
[00:50:22.716 --> 00:50:28.638]  Just make a straight-up donation because when we sell stuff at 50% off, it's really 50% off.
[00:50:29.218 --> 00:50:32.459]  We sell it for 80% off, it's a lost leader.
[00:50:34.426 --> 00:50:36.127]  Even though a lot of these things have sold out.
[00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:40.569]  I mean, I told you bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, at 50% off is going to sell out.
[00:50:40.709 --> 00:50:42.310]  It sold out, we're not getting more for two months.
[00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:44.811]  I'm kind of not good at that sometimes, you know?
[00:50:44.831 --> 00:50:48.773]  Because I should have it go back to regular price and then kind of have it run out by the time the new stuff gets in.
[00:50:48.793 --> 00:50:50.173]  But I want you to see how great it is.
[00:50:50.794 --> 00:50:53.055]  So a bunch of those specials ended because they sold out.
[00:50:54.795 --> 00:50:56.736]  We've got Operation Paul Revere 2018 special.
[00:50:59.299 --> 00:51:02.481]  30 to 80% off site-wide, plus free shipping.
[00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:03.642]  I should have added that yesterday.
[00:51:04.142 --> 00:51:05.083]  Plus the free shipping.
[00:51:05.804 --> 00:51:07.925]  Super Mel Vitality, 50% off.
[00:51:08.205 --> 00:51:09.426]  Real Red Pill, 50% off.
[00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:11.007]  Biome Defense, 50% off.
[00:51:11.047 --> 00:51:12.828]  That's an amazing probiotic.
[00:51:13.168 --> 00:51:14.449]  True Way, 50% off.
[00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.511]  Probiotic Fiber, right out of the gates.
[00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:18.952]  Best Source Fiber, amazing, 50% off.
[00:51:19.673 --> 00:51:22.114]  InfoWars Life Select Products, 40% off.
[00:51:22.555 --> 00:51:24.656]  Clearance Apparel, 80% off.
[00:51:25.317 --> 00:51:28.179]  Aegis Armor Backpack Insert, 20% off.
[00:51:31.169 --> 00:51:32.029]  But here's what I'm telling you.
[00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:35.790]  They think they can crush your will with bullying.
[00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:41.612]  They think they can crush your will by harassing everybody that's libertarian or conservative or Christian.
[00:51:41.632 --> 00:51:43.012]  They think they've got our kids in the schools.
[00:51:43.492 --> 00:51:54.875]  If you take action and you start a YouTube or a Facebook or your own local radio show or a local newsletter or write articles for the paper or letters to the editor, whatever you little bit you do builds up and will win.
[00:51:55.655 --> 00:51:57.237]  When you march, when you demonstrate.
[00:51:57.797 --> 00:52:00.880]  I'm going to start demonstrating more because they're trying to shut us off the web.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.141]  We've got to hit the streets.
[00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:04.143]  I'm going to protest Google, you name it, very soon.
[00:52:04.764 --> 00:52:05.564]  We'll be announcing that.
[00:52:07.046 --> 00:52:10.849]  We've got all our skin in the game because we know we're really up against bad people.
[00:52:10.909 --> 00:52:15.513]  And at a spiritual level, at an instinctive level, they know we've got to oppose it.
[00:52:17.655 --> 00:52:18.957]  They know I love humanity.
[00:52:19.963 --> 00:52:21.044]  That's why they say I'm a racist.
[00:52:21.124 --> 00:52:23.326]  They know I love men and women and care about everybody.
[00:52:23.546 --> 00:52:25.027]  That's why they say I'm an abuser.
[00:52:25.047 --> 00:52:26.248]  Because they know it's the opposite.
[00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:28.450]  They know you know that.
[00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:29.751]  And we knew this was coming.
[00:52:30.031 --> 00:52:31.412]  And they want to send a message to you.
[00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:32.893]  You stand up.
[00:52:33.534 --> 00:52:34.454]  We're going to attack you.
[00:52:34.474 --> 00:52:35.315]  We're going to lie about you.
[00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:35.896]  Well, you know what?
[00:52:36.016 --> 00:52:37.036]  I'm honored to be lied about.
[00:52:37.317 --> 00:52:39.158]  And I've warned crew when they get hired this could happen.
[00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:43.061]  And I'm proud they went through all our former employees and the current ones.
[00:52:43.441 --> 00:52:46.164]  And it took BuzzFeed and others and Daily Mail years
[00:52:47.165 --> 00:52:50.787]  To find people that would engage in Judas Iscariot type activities.
[00:52:51.688 --> 00:52:53.989]  Benedict Arnold activities in my opinion.
[00:52:54.870 --> 00:53:02.395]  Because we can refute all this, and we have evidence to refute it, and we have employees that have been wrong.
[00:53:03.604 --> 00:53:10.049]  Daria doesn't want her last name used because she's one of the only women ever in the most elite units of special operations.
[00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.572]  Because she's a translator and can speak Arabic, Russian, you name it.
[00:53:13.592 --> 00:53:15.073]  Her parents come over here, anti-communist.
[00:53:15.894 --> 00:53:16.654]  She's been here in the U.S.
[00:53:16.674 --> 00:53:18.015]  since she was what, like eight, nine years old?
[00:53:18.796 --> 00:53:26.102]  And they just call her in this filing a Russian operative, a Russian agent, when
[00:53:28.542 --> 00:53:29.523]  And she's not even mad.
[00:53:29.603 --> 00:53:30.845]  She says, yeah, they've gone too far.
[00:53:31.025 --> 00:53:37.212]  But if it has any repercussions on her and her family, or anything, serious defamation.
[00:53:37.232 --> 00:53:44.320]  I mean, you can't call a woman, where people like her would talk about it, G.I.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.001]  Jane's fake.
[00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:45.662]  This is real.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:54:05.886]  And you just sit there and you call somebody, talk about discrimination, talk about defamation, talk about, because of somebody's nationality, you call them an agent of a foreign power when they're a bonafide American patriot and a decorated veteran with over a hundred combat jumps, you name it.
[00:54:07.967 --> 00:54:22.730]  She doesn't like me talking about it, but I've been told by other people, once we hired her with her great resume and all of her backgrounds and all of her defense language school and all her great record and everything, in the military, for all those years, and I've talked to other people in the military, they're like, yeah, you know who that is?
[00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:26.391]  That's one of the only women ever in any of the most elite units there are.
[00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:33.192]  And then you just say, in the file, Jones was there meeting with his Russian
[00:54:34.411 --> 00:54:34.931]  What'd they say?
[00:54:34.951 --> 00:54:37.592]  His Russian operative to get orders.
[00:54:38.132 --> 00:54:43.714]  I mean, Hillary's lawyer says, oh this proves how bad Alex Jones is.
[00:54:44.195 --> 00:54:45.555]  He even makes a political statement.
[00:54:45.575 --> 00:54:47.696]  He brags, I'm Hillary Clinton's former lawyer.
[00:54:48.196 --> 00:54:48.716]  And he is.
[00:54:50.177 --> 00:54:51.617]  He clerked for her.
[00:54:51.657 --> 00:54:52.658]  This is her lawyer.
[00:54:53.238 --> 00:54:55.559]  Her personal lawyer that handles stuff for her.
[00:54:56.059 --> 00:55:01.301]  And she can't believe she lost the election and she's got all hell turned loose to try to do all this and the guy
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:18.064]  It's the law firm of Michael Jackson and all these people and they just say in there in a federal document as if it's total proof that she is a Russian operative and our Russian controller basically.
[00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:28.446]  And see I can't even get into it because I've got a list of things I want to go over and I've got to just do it later in the show because it's all just crazy.
[00:55:29.627 --> 00:55:30.207]  So here's the deal.
[00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:38.640]  If I don't have to worry about money, because I know how to go out and advertise and market, and they cut this off, I do this.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.962]  I mean, I spend a lot of my time in front of the operation.
[00:55:41.002 --> 00:55:41.562]  I'm not complaining.
[00:55:42.103 --> 00:55:48.868]  If you flood us with money, and I mean a crap load, we will not have to sit there and mess with all this stuff.
[00:55:48.888 --> 00:55:53.412]  And I can get really aggressive, and I'm talking about legal defense, I'm talking about legal offense, you name it.
[00:55:53.932 --> 00:55:56.434]  It's all up to you how hard I strike back.
[00:55:56.894 --> 00:55:58.516]  And believe me, I've already pulled the trigger.
[00:55:58.576 --> 00:55:59.857]  We are, this is it.
[00:56:00.237 --> 00:56:01.098]  This is Skyfall.
[00:56:02.173 --> 00:56:07.175]  So, everybody wants to make this personal and everybody, gloves are off.
[00:56:07.915 --> 00:56:15.898]  So, this is a major miscalculation because, but again, they had never get anything real.
[00:56:15.958 --> 00:56:17.199]  Don't you know they've been looking around?
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:23.481]  So, they already tried to take my kids, they've already tried to, you know, the government, the media, all these other groups.
[00:56:24.442 --> 00:56:24.762]  And now,
[00:56:26.425 --> 00:56:35.848]  I believe, and I think the evidence is overwhelming, that this is political, and they admit it's political, and people believe they can do anything if it's against the opposition.
[00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:40.949]  I mean, I don't even go to YouTube and try to get CNN banned for bullying like they do to me.
[00:56:40.989 --> 00:56:42.109]  I just don't act like that.
[00:56:42.129 --> 00:56:43.930]  I don't operate like that.
[00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:52.212]  So, Infowarsstore.com, there's a donate button, and I know there's business owners, I know there's companies, I know there's all the nouveau riche people, I know.
[00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:52.792]  You know what?
[00:56:52.973 --> 00:56:54.253]  I never asked Gary Haven for money.
[00:56:55.131 --> 00:56:59.174]  He's been here before and said, you know, I think I'm going to give you $50,000, Alex, to help do whatever project you need.
[00:56:59.214 --> 00:57:03.037]  I'm like, you know, Gary, you're doing enough giving it to Haiti and your planes and all the things you do.
[00:57:03.057 --> 00:57:04.838]  You just keep that money, Gary, and give it to Haiti.
[00:57:05.218 --> 00:57:07.440]  I'm going to call Gary and say, Gary, you're a billionaire.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.161]  I want a million dollars.
[00:57:09.681 --> 00:57:10.482]  I want $2 million.
[00:57:10.902 --> 00:57:12.143]  I want $5 million.
[00:57:12.423 --> 00:57:13.344]  I bet he gives it to me.
[00:57:13.844 --> 00:57:22.551]  And so I'm telling all the people that tried to give me money over the years, whether it's land, patents, whatever it is, flood us with money and you've got one guarantee.
[00:57:23.391 --> 00:57:28.653]  I will take that, and I will wage war against the globalists, and I will take them on, and I will win.
[00:57:29.093 --> 00:57:29.753]  But you know what?
[00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:33.295]  We only expanded this operation, they tried to shut me down ten years.
[00:57:33.775 --> 00:57:35.756]  I've decided we're about to double in size.
[00:57:36.116 --> 00:57:37.997]  We're going total rampage mode.
[00:57:38.417 --> 00:57:42.838]  Infowarstore.com, everybody buy the products, and everybody donate, and we will win.
[00:57:43.199 --> 00:57:49.381]  Flood me with greenbacks, the war chest, and I will prosecute this war, and I will win with God's grace!
[00:57:52.947 --> 00:58:01.790]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:04.812]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[00:58:04.872 --> 00:58:11.974]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[00:58:12.395 --> 00:58:18.177]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[00:58:18.877 --> 00:58:20.198]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:39.853]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:45.057]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[00:58:45.377 --> 00:58:47.918]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[00:58:47.998 --> 00:58:50.660]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.101]  As above so below.
[00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:55.503]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[00:58:56.383 --> 00:58:57.464]  Most tiniest scales.
[00:58:57.984 --> 00:58:59.085]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:58:59.485 --> 00:59:00.966]  America is building its wall.
[00:59:01.386 --> 00:59:01.846]  Will it work?
[00:59:01.986 --> 00:59:02.486]  We don't know.
[00:59:02.987 --> 00:59:03.567]  Is Trump right?
[00:59:04.267 --> 00:59:06.389]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[00:59:06.889 --> 00:59:12.852]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[00:59:13.212 --> 00:59:19.116]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:59:19.836 --> 00:59:26.139]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[00:59:26.899 --> 00:59:41.906]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[00:59:42.566 --> 00:59:44.949]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:48.833]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:49.173 --> 00:59:52.877]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[00:59:55.360 --> 01:00:01.267]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:12.835]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.955 --> 01:00:46.097]  I gotta be honest with you.
[01:00:46.758 --> 01:00:47.739]  Crank this up for a minute.
[01:00:48.539 --> 01:00:49.320]  Don't tread on me.
[01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:53.824]  I'm actually feeling unleashed right now.
[01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:13.373]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:01:13.393 --> 01:01:14.773]  It is a great honor to be here with you.
[01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:20.656]  We're already one hour into the 34-hour emergency broadcast to defend the Internet, to defend free speech, and defend the Second Amendment.
[01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:23.037]  That's what we named it a week ago when we announced it.
[01:01:24.037 --> 01:01:25.618]  And now, look what we're in the middle of.
[01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:29.299]  All Haitis breaking loose.
[01:01:30.379 --> 01:01:34.861]  I said I would get to a cogent, focused statement about these incredible new false allegations.
[01:01:36.762 --> 01:01:39.283]  But there's so many angles, and it's so false.
[01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:40.764]  It's just all lies.
[01:01:42.714 --> 01:01:46.396]  And then it's Hillary Clinton's former personal lawyer doing it?
[01:01:47.777 --> 01:01:53.800]  And then making political statements about how I'm a bad person and I lie on air and this shows how bad I am?
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.841]  Just saying I'm guilty.
[01:01:58.782 --> 01:01:59.923]  Prosecutors don't even do that.
[01:01:59.963 --> 01:02:01.163]  They just say we're going to show.
[01:02:03.745 --> 01:02:04.145]  And then it's...
[01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:11.468]  It's the Geragos firm that are like leading Armenians and Michael Jackson's lawyers?
[01:02:12.168 --> 01:02:17.831]  I guess that's what you get for fighting the young Turks, saying there was no Armenian genocide, and having them try to kick me off the air.
[01:02:17.951 --> 01:02:20.553]  God, I got the Qatar money trying to get me off the air.
[01:02:20.593 --> 01:02:24.615]  I got the... I guess I got the Armenians trying to get me off the air.
[01:02:24.635 --> 01:02:25.156]  Good God!
[01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:27.297]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:02:29.574 --> 01:02:32.037]  Man, I tell you, the Democratic Party, it's just something wrong with it.
[01:02:32.077 --> 01:02:33.839]  It's just, it's willing to do anything.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:43.190]  And I think it's jumped the shark more ways than one, but... Very, very, very, very saddening.
[01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.231]  I know there are a lot of great Armenians.
[01:02:45.251 --> 01:02:48.032]  They always shake my hand in airports and are big listeners and big fans.
[01:02:49.093 --> 01:02:52.275]  One of the big TV stations were on zoned by an Armenian gentleman, so they're great people.
[01:02:52.295 --> 01:03:07.023]  But I wonder if Garagosh and Garagosh, a couple of his brothers at the firm, I mean, it's like their number one lawyer under them is Hillary, Hillary's former lawyer, doing this and I'm just like,
[01:03:08.353 --> 01:03:12.636]  And then I looked at all the facts and looked at the record and talked to everybody and looked at what we had.
[01:03:12.696 --> 01:03:15.058]  I'm just like, good God, this is incredible.
[01:03:15.779 --> 01:03:16.960]  But I want to get into Trump.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.342]  I want to get into the latest AI news.
[01:03:19.382 --> 01:03:20.923]  I want to get into Pelosi.
[01:03:22.124 --> 01:03:27.308]  I want to get into China censoring Winnie the Pooh.
[01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:34.793]  And the word R, the letter R, that's coming up, but I'm just going to say this.
[01:03:35.093 --> 01:03:48.341]  When I come back, I'm going to be focused as best I can, have the Ashley Beckford clip of her shooting guns ready, please, with audio, and we'll just walk through some of the falsehoods so that I can have one focus statement.
[01:03:48.741 --> 01:03:53.563]  I tried to get in here before the show and tape a statement so I could limit it, and I was busy with other stuff and didn't get it done.
[01:03:53.624 --> 01:03:57.386]  So I knew it'd be hard to do it on air, short and sweet, because
[01:03:59.181 --> 01:03:59.801]  God Almighty.
[01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:09.584]  It doesn't hurt me to have Newsweek say that I've been accused of sexually assaulting a woman or trying to groom a male employee for gay sex.
[01:04:11.384 --> 01:04:15.526]  It hurts me that the media is that bad because the EEOC complaint doesn't even say that.
[01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:18.006]  It says he hugged me once.
[01:04:18.106 --> 01:04:19.907]  I hugged him once and he touched me on the back.
[01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:22.223]  That's not even true.
[01:04:22.703 --> 01:04:27.186]  And then once we were filming the caveman, not caveman, it was the Super Mel Vitality.
[01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:30.949]  You guys cue that up to the caveman, I mean the Super Mel Vitality ad.
[01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.432]  He's dressed up like a caveman, Shane Steiner, that's why I keep saying it.
[01:04:34.452 --> 01:04:36.253]  We're like, why does his muscles look big?
[01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:37.034]  He's all ripped.
[01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:39.036]  We were like trying to aim the lights in the studio.
[01:04:39.256 --> 01:04:40.196]  You'll see the footage coming up.
[01:04:40.857 --> 01:04:46.361]  So I go in his editing studio, it's got like four computers that we all go in this big studio, and I pull up how to light bodybuilders.
[01:04:46.401 --> 01:04:48.183]  So it's guys like in bodybuilding poses.
[01:04:49.131 --> 01:04:54.597]  And then I left that day and Rob came back to work at night and I heard he like blew up and freaked out and that's why he later apologized.
[01:04:54.617 --> 01:04:55.518]  That's an HR record.
[01:04:55.818 --> 01:04:57.360]  We're like, dude, it's bodybuilders.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.203]  He's like, no, you're grooming me for gayness.
[01:05:01.044 --> 01:05:01.865]  It was just crazy.
[01:05:03.527 --> 01:05:08.270]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globals, but they're striking back all over the world.
[01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:14.074]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.
[01:05:14.174 --> 01:05:19.418]  Medical supplies, emergency supplies, communications, tactical, it's all there.

[01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:32.947]  That's fortifiedsupply.com.
[01:05:33.967 --> 01:05:41.191]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:05:51.095 --> 01:05:56.218]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[01:05:56.498 --> 01:05:59.339]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.341]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:10.228 --> 01:06:14.249]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:18.591]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:26.114 --> 01:06:34.617]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.543 --> 01:06:43.623]  We've got a lot to cover.
[01:06:44.524 --> 01:06:51.126]  We've got 33 hours left in the worldwide 34-hour broadcast that we announced we were going to do last week on March 1st.
[01:06:52.947 --> 01:07:00.810]  Paul Revere, Operation Paul Revere 2018, in defense of internet freedom, in defense of free speech, in defense of the Second Amendment.
[01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:10.374]  And I had no idea that we'd be launching this emergency broadcast with YouTube trying to ban us, Facebook trying to ban us, the media, mainstream media, Glenn Beck,
[01:07:11.581 --> 01:07:19.605]  Dan Rather, Brian Stelter, all over television saying he needs to be banned from YouTube and the rest of the Internet.
[01:07:20.285 --> 01:07:21.766]  Because we say he's fake news.
[01:07:21.986 --> 01:07:23.487]  Well, the President says you're fake news.
[01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:24.527]  Does that mean you get banned?
[01:07:26.368 --> 01:07:34.833]  So I really was thinking about what was happening, and my wife said a few days ago at dinner, she said, they're getting ready for something big.
[01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:39.515]  They want to shut you up ahead of something really big that they're going to try to do to you.
[01:07:40.592 --> 01:07:52.283]  And then I talked to other smart folks, like Mike Adams, and he said, before this even broke yesterday, on air, before he knew it had broke, it broke right then while he was on air, he said, they're getting ready for something big against free speech and against the Second Amendment, you name it.
[01:07:53.344 --> 01:07:58.768]  So, let me just go through some of the disinformation and lies.
[01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:02.792]  If you just joined us, I'm going to move into other big news, but this is big national news.
[01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:06.636]  And they're not calling me for quotes, they're not going to have...
[01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:12.674]  You're not going to get to hear anything from me other than this show, because this is what Yellow Journalism and Fake News does.
[01:08:13.274 --> 01:08:17.017]  They take a Daily Mail article, here it is, for radio listeners, I'll read it to you.
[01:08:17.578 --> 01:08:18.639]  Document cam shot please.
[01:08:19.219 --> 01:08:25.385]  Friday, it says, a fired InfoWars staffers at war with Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.992 --> 01:08:36.977]  One claimed he was teased as the site's resident Jew, while the African-American worker says she was mocked for her skin tone, and Jones grabbed her behind.
[01:08:37.557 --> 01:08:39.598]  None of that is true.
[01:08:39.938 --> 01:08:43.820]  That is all 1,000% fake.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.141]  It's like when they tested all my supplements and found them to be totally clean.
[01:08:48.022 --> 01:08:50.903]  And I said, watch, they'll just keep retesting them until they magically say they're not.
[01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:51.923]  And of course that happened.
[01:08:53.064 --> 01:08:55.145]  We had a separate lab test it, and they said, no, it is clean.
[01:08:56.004 --> 01:08:56.804]  They don't give up.
[01:08:56.824 --> 01:09:02.466]  I mean, you think I'm gonna put out supplements that aren't clean knowing they're gonna give extra scrutiny?
[01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:04.267]  Plus, I want you to get quality.
[01:09:05.347 --> 01:09:06.187]  So it's the same thing.
[01:09:06.567 --> 01:09:14.510]  Now, the Daily Mail didn't tell anybody, and I asked the Daily Mail writer, Mr. Perry, I said, you know they're in a relationship, and he goes, well, I'm not gonna talk about that, but yeah.
[01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:15.970]  And I said, did you pay them?
[01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:17.991]  And he goes, I'm not gonna discuss that.
[01:09:18.271 --> 01:09:20.752]  Well, I go, well, people deny they paid them if they didn't.
[01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:23.673]  And I said, well, it'll all come out in Discovery then.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.441]  Because see, that's different.
[01:09:26.521 --> 01:09:48.075]  You can file your EEOC and put the falsehoods there and then have it in the press, but you can't approach the media, have it all lined up, which we know it came before the filing, script it all with a law firm, violate your non-disclosure, not that they're even disclosing anything true, but the point is that they're going past that, and then pay them.
[01:09:49.036 --> 01:09:50.377]  That's going to be the key.
[01:09:50.857 --> 01:09:52.858]  We've already got people on the ground.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.060]  It goes on from there.
[01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:59.081]  A, I don't believe those things.
[01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:03.582]  B, what person in their right gourd would ever do that?
[01:10:03.802 --> 01:10:07.764]  In fact, you go in the New York Times, Washington Post, there's hardly any, quote, minorities.
[01:10:08.164 --> 01:10:09.104]  It's all talk of leftists.
[01:10:09.264 --> 01:10:09.904]  Same thing in Hollywood.
[01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:14.365]  You come in here, there's people of every shape, color, creed, sex, you name it.
[01:10:14.886 --> 01:10:15.946]  Gay people, straight people.
[01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:19.147]  Beanie always walks in here and goes, half the people in here aren't white!
[01:10:20.137 --> 01:10:23.159]  I'm like, yeah, and a lot of the people in management are minorities and women.
[01:10:23.439 --> 01:10:24.600]  Yeah, it's just whoever does a good job.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.020]  That's how we operate.
[01:10:26.601 --> 01:10:27.521]  We're libertarians.
[01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:32.884]  So they know how to attack us on our foundation.
[01:10:33.164 --> 01:10:35.265]  They hit us with the opposite of what we are.
[01:10:37.106 --> 01:10:48.273]  By the evening, three, four hours later, they had headlines out saying that I sexually assaulted
[01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:56.475]  So they take one group of disinformation and then it turns into sexual...
[01:10:57.512 --> 01:10:57.872]  Assault.
[01:10:58.372 --> 01:11:05.475]  So, let's go over just some notes I wrote this morning that are the facts, because all of this is absolutely not true.
[01:11:05.655 --> 01:11:20.822]  They couldn't get me to say it was true, so they called my dad in another building that deals with supplement and the HR over there, and he's like, I don't know anything about it, but you know, they're pretty nice, like a locker room sometimes, but blah blah blah, so they could then act like somebody said there might be something.
[01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:22.583]  That's the one thing that got me mad.
[01:11:23.043 --> 01:11:25.684]  And I got mad yesterday when I was sitting there reading that.
[01:11:27.455 --> 01:11:33.837]  The charges made against myself and InfoWars, my two former employees, are a compendium of lies and false information, and twisting.
[01:11:34.797 --> 01:11:35.617]  We knew this was coming.
[01:11:35.657 --> 01:11:37.478]  This is how Hillary Clinton strikes back.
[01:11:37.518 --> 01:11:38.398]  This is why people fear her.
[01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:54.182]  And it's her main former lawyer, says it on the website, Ben Macelis, who says I'm a bad guy, and this shows it, and that I'm a liar on air, in the statements, to the mail.
[01:11:55.635 --> 01:11:57.716]  So, this is how angry the Democrats are.
[01:12:01.559 --> 01:12:02.159]  So it goes on.
[01:12:05.502 --> 01:12:07.043]  This is the West Coast attack.
[01:12:07.263 --> 01:12:13.927]  I told you months ago we have Hillary's law firm, and I can't disclose the details yet, but I will soon, on the East Coast that we're engaged with.
[01:12:15.048 --> 01:12:17.049]  So, West Coast, East Coast, it's called a pincer attack.
[01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:18.490]  Continuing here.
[01:12:23.614 --> 01:12:24.895]  Newsweek, CNN articles.
[01:12:25.856 --> 01:12:36.483]  In the week leading up to this calculated attack, there have been public efforts by Deep State to pull down our YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, so that we could not respond to these attacks when they hit.
[01:12:36.723 --> 01:12:37.343]  But they failed.
[01:12:37.684 --> 01:12:48.190]  And that's in Bloomberg today, that they admit that it was fake strikes, and that they were removed, and that it was fraudulent, and that I did not say that the students did not die, and I did not say they were crisis actors.
[01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:49.051]  That's Bloomberg.
[01:12:50.168 --> 01:12:53.429]  YouTube's new moderators mistakenly pull right-wing channels.
[01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:56.750]  And then The Verge also reported that they restored InfoWars.
[01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.570]  Fake!
[01:12:57.730 --> 01:13:00.291]  But at least two publications admitted it.
[01:13:00.511 --> 01:13:01.631]  They said it was a mistake.
[01:13:01.671 --> 01:13:02.131]  Yeah, right.
[01:13:03.332 --> 01:13:03.872]  Continuing.
[01:13:05.332 --> 01:13:12.454]  There has been a public campaign by MSM for us to be banned off of the Internet.
[01:13:12.894 --> 01:13:18.616]  The EEOC complaints that have been filed are filled with vicious lies and fiction.
[01:13:19.998 --> 01:13:35.968]  So transparent, via Russiagate, they say that they witnessed Daria, who doesn't want her last name said on air because she was in Army Special Operations, they said that Jones would meet to get orders from his Russian operative.
[01:13:36.268 --> 01:13:39.350]  I mean, you can imagine Democrats are sitting around and they're like,
[01:13:40.438 --> 01:13:41.738]  He said anti-semitic stuff.
[01:13:41.999 --> 01:13:43.039]  He hates black people.
[01:13:43.279 --> 01:13:50.481]  And there's a Russian there running it all, because out of 110 people, we have an army veteran who is Russian.
[01:13:51.422 --> 01:13:52.182]  Think about that.
[01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:53.863]  And then it goes on from there.
[01:13:55.123 --> 01:14:00.525]  And of course, MSM's favorite false charge of anti-semitism, which again is totally, completely false.
[01:14:00.845 --> 01:14:05.346]  David Duke was on in a heated debate, where we were fighting with each other and I was disagreeing with him.
[01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:12.295]  Jacobson said, he had three robs, he says he's anti-semitic and I called him Jacobson too.
[01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:13.537]  People call me Jones in the office.
[01:14:14.157 --> 01:14:14.898]  That's in there too.
[01:14:15.899 --> 01:14:19.823]  He said, I want to get on and debate him and explain to him I'm Jewish and this is a lie and I'm not running things.
[01:14:19.843 --> 01:14:21.265]  And I said, sure buddy, come on on.
[01:14:21.645 --> 01:14:23.947]  He turns that in the complaint and says that
[01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:27.189]  Without his permission, I said he was Jewish.
[01:14:27.249 --> 01:14:29.090]  I have all the affidavits, all the witnesses.
[01:14:29.251 --> 01:14:39.156]  When you came storming in saying, I went on air and I put you on air, Rob, to disagree with David Duke, who I disagreed with, and to have you be able to confront him.
[01:14:39.216 --> 01:14:41.317]  And he goes, I will speak to the Jewish individual.
[01:14:41.617 --> 01:14:42.998]  And then you made a joke out of it.
[01:14:43.018 --> 01:14:45.419]  And then you say we called you the Jewish individual.
[01:14:45.679 --> 01:14:46.540]  Shame on you, Rob.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.201]  Shame on you.
[01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:49.121]  I know your parents.
[01:14:49.141 --> 01:14:49.742]  They're good people.
[01:14:49.922 --> 01:14:50.962]  You're better than that, Rob.
[01:14:51.723 --> 01:14:52.283]  Shame on you.
[01:14:56.277 --> 01:14:59.499]  And of course, MSM's favorite false flag, anti-Semitism, is totally bull.
[01:15:00.139 --> 01:15:16.247]  Looking up lighting for a bodybuilder on a multi-shoot we were doing in the office, and we went into, again, the main editing room where I had a computer, Rob had a computer, and others had computers.
[01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:23.813]  And I googled how to light a bodybuilder because Shane didn't look as big as he does in person with the lighting in here.
[01:15:24.433 --> 01:15:29.876]  And then we leave that day, Rob goes in and sees bodybuilders on a computer, runs over to HR, screams and yells.
[01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:31.296]  We have this all documented.
[01:15:31.496 --> 01:15:40.501]  He then apologizes when they go over and look at the computer and it's bodybuilding and the search says how to light a bodybuilder at our office for a bodybuilding shoot I'm just showing you on video.
[01:15:41.434 --> 01:15:42.575]  And he flipped out at that.
[01:15:42.996 --> 01:15:45.198]  That's grooming for gay sex.
[01:15:45.238 --> 01:15:45.838]  He says that.
[01:15:46.199 --> 01:15:48.561]  He felt that was grooming him for gay sex.
[01:15:48.861 --> 01:15:49.822]  Well, here's the deal, Rob.
[01:15:50.262 --> 01:15:51.704]  I'm into girls, not guys.
[01:15:52.384 --> 01:15:52.725]  Okay?
[01:15:53.325 --> 01:15:54.426]  And everybody knows that.
[01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.850]  So, I think you flattered yourself a little too much there.
[01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:59.611]  But hey, you're the one defaming me.
[01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:00.232]  You're the one.
[01:16:02.932 --> 01:16:04.713]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:09.335]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:10.115 --> 01:16:11.796]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[01:16:11.836 --> 01:16:14.277]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[01:16:14.317 --> 01:16:15.158]  Here is the trailer.
[01:16:15.618 --> 01:16:19.840]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.522]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:16:23.842 --> 01:16:25.583]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[01:16:25.603 --> 01:16:26.123]  Who cares?
[01:16:29.744 --> 01:16:30.764]  You haven't been called.
[01:16:32.645 --> 01:16:33.706]  Go back to Univision.
[01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:36.367]  I think Jeb is a nice person.
[01:16:36.507 --> 01:16:37.348]  He's very low energy.
[01:16:37.448 --> 01:16:42.070]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:42.630]  Throw him out.
[01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:43.991]  Throw him out into the cold.
[01:16:44.451 --> 01:16:49.133]  Don't give him their coat.
[01:16:49.493 --> 01:16:50.293]  No coats.
[01:16:50.313 --> 01:16:52.074]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[01:16:52.354 --> 01:16:52.635]  Lion Den.
[01:16:57.074 --> 01:17:01.617]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[01:17:02.637 --> 01:17:05.199]  The most dishonest human beings.
[01:17:05.239 --> 01:17:06.140]  These people right here.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:11.303]  Look at all the cameras.
[01:17:11.323 --> 01:17:12.003]  So disgusting.
[01:17:12.023 --> 01:17:13.664]  This socialist slash communist.
[01:17:13.684 --> 01:17:14.284]  Crazy Bernie.
[01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:15.865]  He's crazy as it may look.
[01:17:17.106 --> 01:17:19.087]  Pocahontas?
[01:17:19.107 --> 01:17:19.748]  The Indian?
[01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:20.949]  Very offensive.
[01:17:21.049 --> 01:17:22.229]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:17:22.329 --> 01:17:23.130]  A Pocahontas?
[01:17:25.513 --> 01:17:26.154]  Crooked Hillary!
[01:17:26.234 --> 01:17:27.395]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[01:17:27.415 --> 01:17:29.497]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:35.122]  Crooked Hillary!
[01:17:35.142 --> 01:17:38.906]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[01:17:39.026 --> 01:17:42.429]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:44.171]  This had nothing to do with me.
[01:17:44.491 --> 01:17:46.193]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[01:17:47.972 --> 01:17:50.094]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[01:17:50.274 --> 01:17:52.075]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[01:17:52.095 --> 01:17:53.456]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:55.698]  Because they were protecting him.
[01:17:55.818 --> 01:17:56.718]  I'm trying to be nice.
[01:17:56.758 --> 01:17:58.259]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.141]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[01:18:01.382 --> 01:18:03.183]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[01:18:03.223 --> 01:18:04.364]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[01:18:06.127 --> 01:18:08.568]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:09.408]  It just doesn't work.
[01:18:09.448 --> 01:18:11.589]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:14.550]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:17.371]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:20.552]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[01:18:20.632 --> 01:18:23.913]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[01:18:24.193 --> 01:18:25.053]  Repeat after me.
[01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:27.974]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[01:18:28.034 --> 01:18:29.415]  That's not going to happen.
[01:18:29.935 --> 01:18:30.735]  So help me God.
[01:18:31.075 --> 01:18:32.416]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:41.537]  We will make America great again!
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:43.822]  Go home to mommy.
[01:18:44.163 --> 01:18:45.386]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[01:18:45.667 --> 01:18:47.230]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[01:18:48.584 --> 01:18:49.824]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[01:18:49.844 --> 01:18:50.605]  We've carried them all.
[01:18:50.865 --> 01:18:51.505]  We sell them all.
[01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:52.265]  They're all groundbreaking.
[01:18:52.285 --> 01:18:54.066]  But this one, this one is fun.
[01:18:54.726 --> 01:18:55.986]  And very, very celebratory.
[01:18:56.026 --> 01:18:58.567]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[01:18:58.587 --> 01:18:59.408]  It's really a special film.
[01:19:00.508 --> 01:19:00.988]  Thanks a lot.
[01:19:01.008 --> 01:19:05.830]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:09.291]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:12.632]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[01:19:13.192 --> 01:19:25.716]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[01:19:25.996 --> 01:19:29.178]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[01:19:29.218 --> 01:19:30.198]  That's why it stuck.
[01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:35.420]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:36.520]  I thought I knew Trump.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.420]  I studied Trump.
[01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:38.581]  I thought I knew him.
[01:19:39.101 --> 01:19:41.902]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[01:19:42.482 --> 01:19:43.643]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.096 --> 01:20:33.042]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.442 --> 01:20:34.523]  Here I come now, baby!
[01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:40.387]  Okay, so, I'm gonna finish up with this at this segment, get into a bunch of other news in the next segment, but...
[01:20:41.226 --> 01:20:45.427]  We've got a short-time employee, Ashley Beckford, I guess she's here less than a year.
[01:20:45.447 --> 01:20:49.108]  And then you've got Rob Jacobson, who's been here like 14 years.
[01:20:49.168 --> 01:20:51.289]  He's been to probably four or five of my Thanksgivings.
[01:20:52.049 --> 01:20:53.329]  He's been to Christmas over at my house.
[01:20:53.409 --> 01:20:54.710]  I've been really good friends with Rob.
[01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:57.691]  Been to movies with him, hung out with him, been on road trips.
[01:21:00.051 --> 01:21:02.112]  And I'm not going to get into personal stuff about Rob.
[01:21:04.514 --> 01:21:10.477]  Yeah, I know it's the lawyers, the Democratic Party, and things that are going to have to be dealt with.
[01:21:10.517 --> 01:21:14.579]  I mean, this is Hillary Clinton's main lawyer who has filed all this.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.981]  I want to think it was when Ashley and he got together.
[01:21:21.222 --> 01:21:22.002]  We knew about it.
[01:21:22.342 --> 01:21:26.004]  People saw him out at restaurants, saw him together in his apartment.
[01:21:26.044 --> 01:21:26.504]  We knew about it.
[01:21:26.544 --> 01:21:27.544]  We just kind of ignored it.
[01:21:28.145 --> 01:21:30.166]  But then she didn't really like Trump.
[01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.087]  I don't think she liked him from the time she got here.
[01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:39.998]  I don't know if this is part of the infiltration of the Southern Poverty Law Center and groups talk about the...
[01:21:42.165 --> 01:21:42.765]  Media matters.
[01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:44.666]  You know, bragged how they're going to infiltrate media.
[01:21:45.186 --> 01:21:46.146]  But they got together.
[01:21:46.326 --> 01:21:48.227]  We kind of turned a blind eye to it.
[01:21:48.267 --> 01:21:51.387]  We weren't sure until after they left.
[01:21:52.068 --> 01:21:54.348]  And I let her go, and he got really, really, really upset.
[01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:56.969]  And that's in all the HR files, why that all got documented.
[01:21:57.009 --> 01:21:57.769]  And that'll come out.
[01:21:58.589 --> 01:22:02.130]  And then once it's in a lawsuit, once it's there, we can give you all that stuff.
[01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:04.711]  And it's pretty powerful information.
[01:22:05.191 --> 01:22:08.892]  And if they wish to start saying more stuff, I think we're going to go ahead and just bring it all out here.
[01:22:09.696 --> 01:22:10.456]  I'm real close to it.
[01:22:10.796 --> 01:22:11.317]  Might do it today.
[01:22:11.817 --> 01:22:12.137]  We'll see.
[01:22:13.057 --> 01:22:15.278]  Because I'm not going to just sit here while I get crucified in the media.
[01:22:15.818 --> 01:22:22.740]  This could really give the mainstream media a big bloody nose if we release all this.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:30.543]  I mean, I just am such a private guy and I have such a heart that even though I've been lied about massively, I have a tendency to just hold back.
[01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:37.745]  But continuing, looking up lighting for a bodybuilder,
[01:22:38.925 --> 01:22:39.346]  I think so.
[01:23:00.089 --> 01:23:00.929]  In the news reports.
[01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:04.971]  And then it says, though, he felt like it was gay grooming.
[01:23:05.491 --> 01:23:16.295]  So the Newsweek takes bodybuilding in a building with probably 50 editing computers, with a shoot for Super Metal Vitality, with a weightlifter.
[01:23:16.816 --> 01:23:18.376]  My friend Shane Steiner, you all know him.
[01:23:18.736 --> 01:23:19.937]  Famous country singer, you name it.
[01:23:19.957 --> 01:23:21.397]  His brother's world champion rodeo.
[01:23:21.577 --> 01:23:22.138]  So is his dad.
[01:23:23.238 --> 01:23:23.998]  Good family friends.
[01:23:25.439 --> 01:23:25.539]  And
[01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:30.279]  Shane's friends with Rob, too, has known him for 14 years.
[01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:31.139]  It's just bizarre.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.740]  That is now, but the news never says that.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.441]  It's just Newsweek says, grooming gay people for gay stuff.
[01:23:38.281 --> 01:23:39.322]  This is how they operate.
[01:23:42.323 --> 01:23:47.104]  We have three concealed carry classes several times a year, but it was originally at her request.
[01:23:47.684 --> 01:23:51.366]  We've sent them a few other times, and there is no open carry in the office.
[01:23:51.446 --> 01:23:52.806]  But they say there's open carry.
[01:23:53.246 --> 01:23:55.647]  She's anti-gun, but we're pro-gun, and it intimidated her.
[01:23:56.841 --> 01:23:58.463]  And this is just crazy.
[01:23:59.704 --> 01:24:01.105]  And then we'll get to some of the other points.
[01:24:02.066 --> 01:24:07.651]  But let's go to a special report with Ashley Beckford, who got hired as just an intern.
[01:24:07.671 --> 01:24:09.153]  And we said, hey, you want to be on air?
[01:24:09.613 --> 01:24:10.734]  And then gave her two raises.
[01:24:11.194 --> 01:24:13.036]  And it says in there, we were bad.
[01:24:13.096 --> 01:24:14.397]  The raises weren't big enough.
[01:24:15.498 --> 01:24:16.960]  So my lawyers are very confident.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:18.281]  They say none of this even makes sense.
[01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:31.305]  I talked to folks about the supposed image of a Hasidic Jew with Rob's face on it, and they said, yeah, no, Rob had that on his computer, and we asked why, and then Rob Dew pulled it off his computer.
[01:24:31.825 --> 01:24:35.246]  And that was right before he left, see, so you can see what's going on here.
[01:24:36.106 --> 01:24:40.368]  Let's go ahead and go to this part of this special report with Ashley Beckford.
[01:24:40.928 --> 01:24:41.288]  Here it is.
[01:24:47.991 --> 01:24:48.771]  Ashley's shooting a Glock.
[01:24:50.177 --> 01:24:50.657]  Radio listener?
[01:24:50.938 --> 01:24:54.860]  She's got her Infowars.com Trump for President shirt, or Hillary for President shirt.
[01:24:57.061 --> 01:24:58.482]  Hey guys, give me the date of this report.
[01:24:59.563 --> 01:25:00.523]  What is this, mid-2016?
[01:25:02.643 --> 01:25:06.065]  I'm Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:25:06.845 --> 01:25:10.908]  As we know, guns are severely demonized in our society.
[01:25:11.308 --> 01:25:24.315]  In fact, Chris Hayes from MSNBC recently said that he was glad that the terrorist who bombed Chelsea did not have a firearm because the carnage would have been much greater.
[01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:25.476]  What a joke!
[01:25:26.016 --> 01:25:38.087]  As we know, we've seen so many incidences where people with Islamic backgrounds have been procuring firearms and then using them to inflict deadly carnage.
[01:25:38.327 --> 01:25:46.834]  They've been attacking people from San Bernardino, quote, workplace violence to the Orlando nightclub shooting hate crime.
[01:25:47.194 --> 01:25:52.199]  We have people all over the country and all over the world who are attacking people with guns.
[01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:58.301]  That's why I realized in order to be a true feminist, I had to learn to protect myself.
[01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:09.864]  Now she says that it was a culture of guns that intimidated her, and we have emails where she requested, and others requested, the free class.
[01:26:11.226 --> 01:26:14.487]  By the way, taught by a black firearms instructor who's our good buddy, Mr. Cargill.
[01:26:14.707 --> 01:26:29.132]  In this uncertain world, I knew that I needed to take advantage of the Texas laws and go ahead and get my concealed handgun license and my license to carry by going ahead and going to Central Texas Gun Works.
[01:26:29.252 --> 01:26:30.553]  Met Michael Cargill.
[01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:32.973]  He's a friend and fan of the show.
[01:26:33.493 --> 01:26:35.514]  And it only took one day.
[01:26:35.574 --> 01:26:37.155]  It only took a few hours for me.
[01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:40.517]  She says in there that we were white supremacists.
[01:26:40.537 --> 01:26:45.922]  She also said on our Facebook, and by the way Ashley, we saved all that stuff you deleted off Facebook before you filed this.
[01:26:47.203 --> 01:26:52.788]  And Rob, we filed and we got all the other stuff off your Facebook before you deleted it.
[01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.989]  It's all saved.
[01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.711]  We're not stupid.
[01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:58.133]  We figured it out about a month before, Rob.
[01:26:58.814 --> 01:27:00.595]  We figured this might get pulled, Rob.
[01:27:01.876 --> 01:27:02.217]  And so,
[01:27:03.541 --> 01:27:14.067]  Don't know how it's going to go for Hillary's former top lawyer, Ben Macelis, who brags on his own law firm website about this.
[01:27:14.728 --> 01:27:15.668]  I can't look at any more of it.
[01:27:16.549 --> 01:27:24.634]  Can we play the Supermail Vitality ad, though, from four years ago with Leanne McAdoo?
[01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:28.710]  Who wanted to be in the shoot, wanted to be in the caveman shoot.
[01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:30.972]  There's this new thing where women are in movies.
[01:27:31.173 --> 01:27:31.893]  Leon's not saying this.
[01:27:31.953 --> 01:27:34.636]  Women are in movies and they say kissing scenes are now assault.
[01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:37.378]  But you sign on, you do a kissing scene, you do a whatever.
[01:27:37.579 --> 01:27:39.020]  This is a caveman running off with the women.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:39.761]  You know, fine.
[01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:41.022]  Fine.
[01:27:41.883 --> 01:27:44.865]  And this is the recruiting?
[01:27:45.919 --> 01:27:47.319]  This is grooming for gayness.
[01:27:47.459 --> 01:27:49.500]  This is where that came from.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.941]  Shane didn't look as big under our lights, so we do lighting right here.
[01:27:54.221 --> 01:27:57.802]  We tried to light things to make his muscles look like they really look, but it didn't work.
[01:27:58.203 --> 01:27:59.923]  So he didn't look as big as he is, even though he's huge.
[01:28:00.723 --> 01:28:02.984]  So let's go ahead and go to that footage.
[01:28:03.906 --> 01:28:05.187]  Unprecedented.
[01:28:33.766 --> 01:28:39.408]  Get everybody out of here!
[01:28:39.488 --> 01:28:40.068]  Superman.
[01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:47.290]  That is grooming for gayness.
[01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:50.311]  I mean, unbelievable.
[01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:53.432]  This is unbelievable, this info.
[01:28:53.892 --> 01:28:59.114]  And I can't believe the Clinton-connected lawyer would do this.
[01:28:59.194 --> 01:28:59.774]  It's crazy.
[01:29:03.687 --> 01:29:08.549]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:29:08.829 --> 01:29:13.291]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:29:13.612 --> 01:29:21.955]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:29:22.295 --> 01:29:25.637]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[01:29:25.797 --> 01:29:30.721]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:29:31.042 --> 01:29:38.028]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:29:38.348 --> 01:29:41.951]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:29:42.272 --> 01:29:46.615]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:29:46.996 --> 01:29:50.559]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:29:50.879 --> 01:29:54.742]  And a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:29:55.062 --> 01:29:58.965]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[01:29:58.985 --> 01:30:00.687]  That's Infowarslife.com.

[01:30:13.417 --> 01:30:19.141]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:36.188]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:30:36.568 --> 01:30:38.709]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:30:39.069 --> 01:30:40.249]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:30:42.490 --> 01:30:44.311]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:31:32.768 --> 01:31:34.209]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:31:34.369 --> 01:31:36.791]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[01:31:36.951 --> 01:31:44.256]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.085]  That means it's clean.
[01:32:23.445 --> 01:32:24.426]  That means it's pure.

[01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:09.333]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.274 --> 01:33:30.288]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:55.217 --> 01:34:09.636]  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest is on record, last year on our broadcast, predicting that white farmers would have all their land taken in South Africa, that similarly has been done in many other
[01:34:10.959 --> 01:34:37.466]  areas of africa and that now they're going beyond uh... replacing apartheid with an apartheid state where whites are treated unfairly but where whites are actually killed in the new president saying we're not gonna kill all the whites yet he just made that statement yesterday uh... in other statements uh... the new president communist president talks about how they are going to take their land and so last year our guest warned uh... that soon
[01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:38.987]  I think?
[01:34:57.639 --> 01:35:04.622]  That we were bullying children and engaging in all these activities on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, you name it, where we were being restricted and banned.
[01:35:05.062 --> 01:35:07.083]  CNN was running operations to have us banned.
[01:35:07.443 --> 01:35:12.606]  Bloomberg is now reporting that YouTube said that the strikes were false and have been removed.
[01:35:13.266 --> 01:35:18.148]  Also, The Verge is reporting that the strikes were removed, that they were fraudulent.
[01:35:19.409 --> 01:35:21.770]  Mistakenly shut down.
[01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:27.092]  So, we're going to be going over all of that today.
[01:35:28.359 --> 01:35:31.841]  It's hard to look at the Daily Mail the same now, though, because they do a lot of good stuff.
[01:35:31.861 --> 01:35:37.743]  That's why I was shocked when they went with that fake EEOC complaint that I already went over earlier.
[01:35:37.763 --> 01:35:38.884]  But let me just finish up with that.
[01:35:38.904 --> 01:35:48.008]  My lawyers have looked at this and said the complaint is so contradictory and poorly written that it must be a publicity stunt.
[01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:54.111]  But I don't think, I don't think Ashley and Rob know that.
[01:35:56.530 --> 01:36:04.274]  And again, she claims I hugged her, and the media says it's sexual assault, and quite frankly, she was very touchy-feely, as everybody is going to testify.
[01:36:04.354 --> 01:36:05.655]  This is true, and I am not.
[01:36:07.195 --> 01:36:09.977]  So, it's just unbelievable.
[01:36:10.017 --> 01:36:15.680]  Like, saying you hugged somebody is now sexual assault, according to Newsweek and the rest of it.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.800]  They're coming after us.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.841]  It's like they're coming after Trump.
[01:36:18.841 --> 01:36:21.243]  And Trump is now backpedaling on the Second Amendment.
[01:36:22.223 --> 01:36:23.124]  It is amazing.
[01:36:24.564 --> 01:36:25.365]  Meanwhile, you know,
[01:36:28.561 --> 01:36:30.962]  You know, I'm not even going to play the race card in my defense.
[01:36:32.303 --> 01:36:33.223]  None of it's true anyways.
[01:36:33.523 --> 01:36:34.544]  I'm just not going to go there.
[01:36:34.564 --> 01:36:36.585]  It's a tactic.
[01:36:36.605 --> 01:36:38.206]  Trump says, I'm not going to go there, but then he always goes there.
[01:36:38.246 --> 01:36:39.426]  I'm the same way, because I can't help it.
[01:36:39.446 --> 01:36:39.946]  I think about it.
[01:36:40.387 --> 01:36:43.268]  It's like, when I say I'm anti-communist Chinese, they say I'm anti-Asian.
[01:36:43.288 --> 01:36:44.528]  My sister's Korean adopted.
[01:36:44.889 --> 01:36:45.209]  I love her.
[01:36:45.249 --> 01:36:45.809]  She's my blood.
[01:36:45.829 --> 01:36:46.389]  She's my family.
[01:36:46.609 --> 01:36:47.390]  She works here, by the way.
[01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:50.211]  She's a great photographer, and great videographer, and great researcher.
[01:36:52.152 --> 01:36:52.632]  She's Korean.
[01:36:55.194 --> 01:36:55.454]  You know,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:09.138]  My ex-wife's family were not practicing Jews, but they were liberals and I just liked my ex-wife and I didn't even really think about the fact that
[01:37:10.276 --> 01:37:11.417]  That she was Jewish.
[01:37:11.437 --> 01:37:13.738]  That's how blind I am to that type of stuff.
[01:37:14.519 --> 01:37:19.182]  And then what it means for my children and everything else, and all the white supremacists hating me and everything else.
[01:37:19.662 --> 01:37:25.826]  And that just shows how sick this is that now the media says I'm an anti-Semite.
[01:37:26.567 --> 01:37:27.888]  That's why I'm pro-Israel.
[01:37:29.248 --> 01:37:32.470]  That's why I've been defending Netanyahu, is because I'm an anti-Semite.
[01:37:33.795 --> 01:37:42.481]  It's the left and the self-loathing Jews that use all this anti-Semitism crud everywhere, and it's crazy.
[01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:47.265]  And I'm not saying Netanyahu's perfect either, neither is Trump, but he's nationalistic, the globalists are trying to bring him down.
[01:37:48.405 --> 01:37:51.407]  And so, it's just mind-blowing to watch this happen.
[01:37:53.069 --> 01:37:53.409]  And look,
[01:37:55.066 --> 01:37:56.767]  My ex-wife's mother was Jewish.
[01:37:56.787 --> 01:37:57.487]  Her dad wasn't.
[01:37:57.807 --> 01:37:58.287]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:37:58.327 --> 01:37:59.147]  That makes her Jewish.
[01:37:59.408 --> 01:38:03.289]  And you can then argue, since she's a mother, that I guess Israel would accept my kids.
[01:38:03.609 --> 01:38:05.169]  But they're just red-blooded Christian Americans.
[01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:06.630]  But I'm not ashamed of their Jewish heritage.
[01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:09.011]  But I'll tell you this, it takes a lot of baggage with it.
[01:38:09.031 --> 01:38:10.231]  I've gotten a lot of hate for it.
[01:38:10.791 --> 01:38:17.734]  And then, to get hate from leftist groups that know the truth is just... The Nazis are bad, and the leftist groups are just as bad.
[01:38:18.294 --> 01:38:18.834]  They're all bad.
[01:38:19.314 --> 01:38:27.038]  Soros is a Nazi collaborator that helped round up thousands of his fellow Jews, and then he has groups saying, I'm a Nazi collaborator, when he's a Nazi.
[01:38:27.098 --> 01:38:30.759]  I mean, it just shows how reprobate and bankrupt the leftists are.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.240]  And, she's my ex-wife now.
[01:38:35.781 --> 01:38:42.364]  And, you know, it's my, uh, my new wife's, her pedigree's German, three quarters German, from Omaha.
[01:38:43.288 --> 01:38:46.089]  And, uh, a quarter Irish, and I'm proud of that background.
[01:38:46.469 --> 01:38:51.191]  And any Semites, call her a, uh, call her Jewish and everything else.
[01:38:51.251 --> 01:38:52.632]  And if she was, I'd be proud of it.
[01:38:52.672 --> 01:38:56.074]  But no, she's got a noble nose, but she's not Jewish.
[01:38:56.954 --> 01:39:00.615]  So, you know, that's what all this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:00.836 --> 01:39:03.197]  And it just is insane.
[01:39:04.197 --> 01:39:05.778]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:39:09.013 --> 01:39:22.323]  I'm just trying to have free market and restore the country, and they're using race politics and race war politics, and everywhere the left's in control, by the time they get into the final equations, they always kill anybody that's free market, kill anybody that's Christian, and kill anybody that's white.
[01:39:22.703 --> 01:39:27.567]  And it's happened in five different African nations the last 30 years, and now, as it was predicted, it's happening in South Africa.
[01:39:27.727 --> 01:39:29.488]  Can we look at the date of when our guest was last on?
[01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:33.952]  We come back, I'm going to go to him for several segments, but I need you to just say this right now, and then briefly.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:35.820]  They just corrected me.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:45.143]  I'm so used to going on at 11 a.m., we do 24-hour broadcasts for longer ones, and then it... David Knight's on for six months, doing a great job with his broadcast, 8 a.m.
[01:39:45.183 --> 01:39:46.344]  every morning, the David Knight Show.
[01:39:47.604 --> 01:39:48.364]  Had some trademark issues.
[01:39:48.384 --> 01:39:50.385]  We're going to call it David Knight Show Starting Soon or something else.
[01:39:50.405 --> 01:39:51.445]  I was calling it Real News.
[01:39:52.045 --> 01:39:55.026]  The point is, is that some Democrat groups trademarked that and suing us.
[01:39:55.046 --> 01:39:59.908]  That's another little side issue I didn't tell anybody about.
[01:40:00.168 --> 01:40:01.768]  In three of the suits, it's Clinton lawyers.
[01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:03.069]  And they admit they are.
[01:40:03.973 --> 01:40:08.119]  And then I got little messages like, you know, back off buddy, it's gonna get a lot worse.
[01:40:09.361 --> 01:40:10.022]  I wanted to say this.
[01:40:10.663 --> 01:40:11.204]  I wanted to say this.
[01:40:11.224 --> 01:40:15.951]  In fact, take this club and put it on the front of segment two and three, because I want this up front.
[01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:18.158]  I'm not changing course.
[01:40:18.339 --> 01:40:19.400]  I'm not backing down.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.521]  I'm not giving in.
[01:40:21.562 --> 01:40:26.327]  There's nowhere I want to be more than right here in this fight for America and for justice and for truth.
[01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:27.828]  You guys want to be the lie.
[01:40:28.209 --> 01:40:29.750]  You want to be involved in deception.
[01:40:30.231 --> 01:40:35.837]  All you Clinton operatives and lawyers and people want to sit here and play these games
[01:40:36.417 --> 01:40:37.878]  I know our listeners want justice.
[01:40:37.918 --> 01:40:38.919]  They want the country back.
[01:40:39.179 --> 01:40:39.960]  They want the world back.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.061]  And I believe in our listeners.
[01:40:41.481 --> 01:40:44.844]  And I believe they're going to financially buy our products and spread our articles and videos.
[01:40:45.585 --> 01:40:50.308]  And know that you're trying to shut us down as CNN and others have openly said they're trying to do.
[01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:52.670]  And that the Streisand effect is going to blow up in your face.
[01:40:53.551 --> 01:40:54.652]  And I know there's providence.
[01:40:54.892 --> 01:40:55.773]  And I trust in God.
[01:40:55.813 --> 01:40:57.634]  Whatever happens is in God's plan.
[01:40:57.955 --> 01:41:03.659]  But I actually feel good doing this because it confirms how bad you guys are.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:04.960]  I don't
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.021]  Mike Adams was offered $50,000 last year, who contributes here and has a big office in Austin.
[01:41:31.041 --> 01:41:31.021]  $50,000.
[01:41:31.061 --> 01:41:33.042]  I think he's ready to go public with who did it, by the way.
[01:41:33.222 --> 01:41:33.902]  Which publication?
[01:41:33.922 --> 01:41:36.102]  We're gonna take the gloves off, okay?
[01:41:36.822 --> 01:41:43.323]  And we're doing some investigations and all the rest of it, but if people want the gloves off, baby, you got it.
[01:41:43.784 --> 01:41:46.784]  And how strong our punches are politically is up to you.

[01:42:25.905 --> 01:42:29.429]  I want to put up a big donate button, actually, right there on the front.
[01:42:29.449 --> 01:42:29.929]  We're going to do that.
[01:42:29.949 --> 01:42:32.472]  You can find the donate page, but where is the link?
[01:42:32.512 --> 01:42:33.073]  I'm trying to find it.
[01:42:33.453 --> 01:42:39.056]  We're going to email it out to everybody that signed up for the newsletter that's free at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:42:39.256 --> 01:42:40.616]  No, no, I know that's the donate button.
[01:42:40.636 --> 01:42:43.798]  I'm saying where on InfoWarsStore.com is the link?
[01:42:44.378 --> 01:42:48.320]  Because we need to make it easy to find on the front page.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.700]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.822]  I wanted to pop up for that for everybody.
[01:42:52.882 --> 01:42:53.842]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:42:54.282 --> 01:42:55.103]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:55.223 --> 01:42:56.203]  Thank you for your support.
[01:42:56.323 --> 01:42:59.985]  You'll decide whether we survive and defeat the Globalists or are destroyed.
[01:43:02.577 --> 01:43:04.539]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:43:04.559 --> 01:43:04.979]  Go ahead.
[01:43:05.259 --> 01:43:07.481]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:43:07.501 --> 01:43:10.523]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:43:11.344 --> 01:43:12.465]  It just gets old, man.
[01:43:12.765 --> 01:43:14.507]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:43:15.207 --> 01:43:17.269]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:43:17.509 --> 01:43:21.552]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:43:22.073 --> 01:43:24.014]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:43:24.815 --> 01:43:27.157]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:43:27.177 --> 01:43:28.638]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:43:28.878 --> 01:43:29.779]  Us being shut down?
[01:43:29.999 --> 01:43:31.040]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:32.501]  You know what, Alex?
[01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:33.622]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:43:33.642 --> 01:43:34.443]  Hey, Frank!
[01:43:34.744 --> 01:43:40.109]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:44.694]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:43:44.934 --> 01:43:47.797]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:43:48.058 --> 01:43:48.438]  You understand?
[01:43:48.538 --> 01:43:49.800]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.301]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:43:52.282 --> 01:43:57.188]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[01:44:07.159 --> 01:44:08.200]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.864]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[01:44:12.084 --> 01:44:13.485]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[01:44:13.526 --> 01:44:14.326]  They're suing me.
[01:44:14.587 --> 01:44:15.788]  I'm under attack, Frank!
[01:44:16.248 --> 01:44:18.050]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:19.432]  We were bringing five million in a year.
[01:44:19.452 --> 01:44:20.693]  It cost a lot to run this.
[01:44:20.853 --> 01:44:22.735]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[01:44:22.975 --> 01:44:24.597]  I keep growing more as fast as I can.
[01:44:24.937 --> 01:44:27.720]  And as fast as I cut them off, I'm shooting out tentacles.
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:29.562]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[01:44:29.602 --> 01:44:30.163]  Tell him right there.
[01:44:30.203 --> 01:44:30.443]  Frank!
[01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:31.283]  Hey, Frank!
[01:44:31.523 --> 01:44:32.784]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:49.288]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention, although of course everybody likes a little bit of attention, it's nice, but I can't do TV and I can't do radio and I can't publish books and I can't sell anything and I can't do live events because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... We're the heretics!
[01:44:49.408 --> 01:44:52.149]  Yeah, exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:56.050]  So it's not bragging, it's a daily reality and that's why you've got to support things like InfoWars and
[01:44:56.710 --> 01:44:58.891]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[01:44:58.911 --> 01:44:59.411]  We're doing it now.

[01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:20.900]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:25.243]  All we're saying is, we kicked their ass, but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.

[01:45:29.086 --> 01:45:29.847]  Do you understand?
[01:45:29.867 --> 01:45:31.048]  I need your help, Frank!

[01:47:06.358 --> 01:47:08.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:53.254 --> 01:47:58.859]  So, here's Julius Malema, about seven months after our guest joined us to warn of this.
[01:47:59.219 --> 01:48:01.781]  He said he would do just this, and we're about to go to our guest.
[01:48:01.801 --> 01:48:19.635]  This is what he's now saying about taking the white people's farmland, which, by the way, is the most productive and employs the most people, and when they took it and five other African nations, and they totally collapsed into cannibalism, just like Venezuela, you can't call people dying from starvation, saying they died from starvation.
[01:48:19.675 --> 01:48:19.956]  Here it is.
[01:48:21.638 --> 01:48:34.435]  The expropriation of land without compensation is envisaged as one of the measures that we will use to accelerate redistribution of land to black South Africans.
[01:48:35.236 --> 01:48:36.819]  We will need to determine
[01:48:38.368 --> 01:48:52.571]  Collectively, how we can implement this measure in a way that promotes agricultural production, improves food security, advance rural development, reduce poverty.
[01:48:52.591 --> 01:48:54.372]  Alright, let's stop right there before I throw up.
[01:48:54.512 --> 01:48:57.893]  We have another clip where they talk about, we're not going to kill all the whites yet.
[01:48:58.293 --> 01:48:59.413]  Everywhere else this happens.
[01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:03.474]  I mean, I just don't know why they don't just get secret technology from Wakanda.
[01:49:04.915 --> 01:49:07.738]  What's happening is they want to kick the Wakanda technology out.
[01:49:07.778 --> 01:49:11.582]  They want to kick the Dutch and British Afrikaners out of the country.
[01:49:11.622 --> 01:49:14.925]  And, you know, the problem is the West didn't let those poor folks get out.
[01:49:15.406 --> 01:49:17.668]  So it looks like increasingly they're just being murdered.
[01:49:18.068 --> 01:49:19.690]  And joining us is Simon Roche.
[01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:22.092]  Thank you for coming on again.
[01:49:22.453 --> 01:49:25.195]  The websites are suidlanders.com.
[01:49:25.996 --> 01:49:30.960]  S-U-I-D Landers dot org and free S-T-A-R-T-R.
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.281]  Tell folks how you best pronounce those.
[01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:38.385]  You've got all the videos, all the articles, the videos of white farmers being murdered, the media celebrating it.
[01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.306]  They celebrate cops being killed here.
[01:49:40.687 --> 01:49:41.988]  This is what the Marxists do everywhere.
[01:49:42.028 --> 01:49:46.311]  Give us a report since you joined us last year and what you predicted has now come true.
[01:49:46.331 --> 01:49:50.814]  He's now president and he's now calling for your land to be taken and we'll play the clip coming up.
[01:49:51.174 --> 01:49:54.236]  He says he's not going to kill you quite yet though so he's being liberal.
[01:49:54.276 --> 01:49:54.857]  You should thank him.
[01:49:57.034 --> 01:49:57.274]  Yes.
[01:49:57.595 --> 01:50:04.760]  Well, Cyril Ramaphosa, the guy that you just featured in your clip, is the new president of the Republic of South Africa.
[01:50:05.321 --> 01:50:17.771]  And shortly after gaining the presidency, he made it very clear that land expropriation without compensation, and this is vital for people to know, but not only land,
[01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:31.500]  As in farmland, but white-owned property will now be subject to expropriation and two days ago the Parliament accepted a motion
[01:50:32.279 --> 01:50:37.903]  To initiate a process to change the constitution of the country so that this can go ahead.
[01:50:38.523 --> 01:50:43.086]  The motion proceeded with 241 votes to 83.
[01:50:43.467 --> 01:51:01.259]  So there was overwhelming support for it and clearly we are now entering that phase where white-owned property, as it has been defined, not merely land, especially land but not merely land, white-owned property will now be confiscated or expropriated without compensation.
[01:51:03.294 --> 01:51:05.615]  And by the way, you corrected it when I had you on.
[01:51:05.976 --> 01:51:13.881]  The president called for the confiscation without any compensation of white farmer land that produces, I know, the majority of the food.
[01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.202]  And we'll talk about those numbers in a moment.
[01:51:16.883 --> 01:51:18.203]  He's saying take the land compensation.
[01:51:18.263 --> 01:51:23.467]  It's Julius Malema, the communist leader, who says we're not going to kill you quite yet.
[01:51:23.567 --> 01:51:25.968]  So you've got the good cop who says we're going to take your land.
[01:51:25.988 --> 01:51:27.269]  The bad cop says we're going to kill you.
[01:51:27.769 --> 01:51:29.991]  Let's go ahead and play Julius Malema.
[01:51:30.031 --> 01:51:30.331]  Here it is.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:39.688]  The rightful owners, our peace was disturbed by white men's arrival here.
[01:51:40.329 --> 01:51:43.613]  They committed a black genocide.
[01:51:44.194 --> 01:51:48.320]  They killed our people during land dispossession.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:51.983]  Today, we are told, don't disturb them.
[01:51:52.364 --> 01:51:57.769]  Even when they disturbed our peace, they found peaceful Africans here.
[01:51:58.230 --> 01:51:59.271]  They killed them.
[01:51:59.591 --> 01:52:02.474]  They slaughtered them like animals.
[01:52:02.915 --> 01:52:07.880]  We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now.
[01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:15.474]  What we are calling for is for peaceful occupation of the land.
[01:52:16.635 --> 01:52:19.257]  And we don't owe anyone apology.
[01:52:19.737 --> 01:52:23.360]  First we take your land, then we kick you off the internet like Hitler did the Jews, then we kill you.
[01:52:24.001 --> 01:52:26.963]  And I forget the numbers, but guys can you look it up?
[01:52:27.483 --> 01:52:28.604]  The World Almanac Online.
[01:52:29.245 --> 01:52:36.033]  I want to say Africa's population is 50 times what it was when colonization started 400, 500 years ago.
[01:52:36.754 --> 01:52:40.038]  I mean, the West has brought nothing but overall good.
[01:52:40.498 --> 01:52:45.164]  Just like America's, when you got here, the natives would kill you if you didn't help fight the other natives.
[01:52:45.484 --> 01:52:46.526]  They were always killing each other.
[01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:49.428]  Just like Europeans before the Renaissance were killing each other.
[01:53:18.773 --> 01:53:21.221]  Why do folks do this and why is it escalating?
[01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:29.415]  It's escalating because the government has failed to deliver on anything that it's promised over recent years.
[01:53:29.595 --> 01:53:32.497]  The government has been in power now for almost 24 years.
[01:53:32.857 --> 01:53:36.440]  That is to say, the African National Congress party of Nelson Mandela fame.
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:45.846]  In 24 years, the life expectancy has declined by at least 4.3 years, which is almost impossible to do, but it has been done.
[01:53:45.946 --> 01:53:51.270]  And indeed, if you follow the statistics of the United States Census Bureau,
[01:53:52.151 --> 01:54:00.477]  Released in late 2016, then the decline in age, life expectancy is far greater.
[01:54:00.517 --> 01:54:02.178]  It's approaching 10 years.
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.202]  The unemployment rate, the official rate is 38.1%.
[01:54:07.662 --> 01:54:11.145]  The unofficial rate is obviously far higher and more realistic.
[01:54:12.046 --> 01:54:27.307]  At the recent United Nations AIDS conference held in South Africa, a global AIDS conference, it was revealed that 19%, so one in five practically, of all AIDS cases in the world
[01:54:27.988 --> 01:54:29.068]  is in South Africa.
[01:54:29.568 --> 01:54:30.369]  It's a shambles.
[01:54:30.529 --> 01:54:31.709]  It's an absolute shambles.
[01:54:31.869 --> 01:54:42.671]  I live in a little, very small village on the banks of the famous Orange River, named for Prince William of Orange, the Protestant chap who stood against Spain.
[01:54:42.691 --> 01:54:49.973]  And we have recently discovered that our African National Congress municipality
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:57.624]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:54:57.664 --> 01:55:00.846]  Rhodesia, then Zimbabwe, all these other places, the Congo.
[01:55:01.186 --> 01:55:09.191]  First they nationalize, then they make the whites keep working on the land, then they kill them, then everything collapses, then they have multi-billion famous inflation.
[01:55:10.351 --> 01:55:11.972]  Why is Africa so corrupt?
[01:55:12.533 --> 01:55:16.756]  Once the evil colonists are kicked out, then you should have, you know, Wakanda.
[01:55:16.796 --> 01:55:21.639]  It should be like spaceships and, you know, the vibranium and everything, which would be great.
[01:55:21.659 --> 01:55:22.400]  I mean, I love Africa.
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.240]  It's a beautiful country.
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:25.882]  I mean, a continent, a lot of beautiful countries.
[01:55:26.342 --> 01:55:34.228]  I want them to do well, fellow humans, but this thing about get the whites out that brought the civilization, why does it then recede back into total barbarism?
[01:55:34.268 --> 01:55:38.611]  Everybody's starving, but the, you know, the president's son has 100 Lamborghinis.
[01:55:40.638 --> 01:55:41.859]  Let me put it to you this way.
[01:55:41.919 --> 01:56:01.731]  Shortly after that chap Cyril Ramaphosa, our new national president, was elected the president of his party prior to becoming the national president, he and a group of senior people went to Nelson Mandela's grandson, who was a traditional leader as a chief, and they sought permission
[01:56:02.461 --> 01:56:06.024]  To go to Nelson Mandela's grave to shake his bones.
[01:56:06.505 --> 01:56:16.314]  That is to say, to invoke the ancestral spirit of Nelson Mandela to reinvigorate the African National Congress party.
[01:56:16.735 --> 01:56:19.097]  And that is indicative of the gulf
[01:56:19.804 --> 01:56:21.867]  Between one culture and another.
[01:56:22.428 --> 01:56:25.212]  They're so far apart that they're irreconcilable.
[01:56:25.272 --> 01:56:26.814]  It's just as simple as that, Alex.
[01:56:26.894 --> 01:56:28.817]  Well, why not evacuate?
[01:56:29.097 --> 01:56:31.260]  I mean, because they're just, it's gonna, they're gonna get killed.
[01:56:31.821 --> 01:56:33.764]  I mean, why not just, just, just evacuate?
[01:56:35.151 --> 01:56:35.951]  No, no, no.
[01:56:36.372 --> 01:56:43.735]  Our forefathers built this land with faith in God, blood, sweat, and tears, Alex, and they built something beautiful!
[01:56:44.055 --> 01:56:45.075]  We will not go!
[01:56:45.376 --> 01:56:48.357]  We will not capitulate to the face of barbarism.
[01:56:48.417 --> 01:56:50.298]  It's an unacceptable proposition.
[01:56:50.578 --> 01:56:52.939]  We will stand... We don't want anybody to die.
[01:56:52.959 --> 01:56:54.660]  We don't want anybody to die, but they're gonna die.
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:56.181]  They're gonna kill you and then kill themselves.
[01:56:56.201 --> 01:56:56.901]  You can't help them.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.241]  You're standing in the way of Wakanda!
[01:56:59.381 --> 01:57:00.782]  Alex, we are going to stand.
[01:57:01.042 --> 01:57:07.667]  If we are the last Christian nation in the history of the world that stands for Almighty God, we will stand and fight and die here.
[01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:08.447]  Watch us!
[01:57:09.148 --> 01:57:11.870]  No, I actually respect that and I understand it, and I know what you guys have been through.
[01:57:11.890 --> 01:57:12.250]  It's been hellish.
[01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:21.117]  I know you've been really good to the locals, built everybody up, the population exploded, and there's a lot of black folks that actually don't want to see everybody go, but, you know, they get killed and hacked up, don't they?
[01:57:21.137 --> 01:57:24.339]  I read about it all the time, that the blacks that want to work with everybody, they get killed, don't they?
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.922]  Yeah, it's a very, very big problem.
[01:57:27.962 --> 01:57:31.704]  That factor is referred usually to as intimidation.
[01:57:32.104 --> 01:57:35.806]  So, in other words, anybody who doesn't tow the party line gets chopped to pieces.
[01:57:35.827 --> 01:57:38.428]  There are tens of thousands of examples.
[01:57:38.448 --> 01:57:42.191]  Didn't Winnie used to hang the gasoline tires on little kids' heads?
[01:57:42.231 --> 01:57:44.992]  Her favorite thing she used to have was hearing little kids' heads pop.
[01:57:45.012 --> 01:57:46.253]  They like to do that.
[01:57:46.773 --> 01:57:47.834]  The necklacing is what it's called.
[01:57:47.854 --> 01:57:48.374]  It's very liberal.
[01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:48.875]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:53.004 --> 01:57:56.827]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.
[01:57:57.127 --> 01:58:02.090]  Alpha Power helps with a large amount of functions for your body to help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:05.973]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:06.253 --> 01:58:09.815]  Listen to all these incredible 5 star reviews from verified buyers.
[01:58:10.135 --> 01:58:11.196]  Papa Black Wilson says,
[01:58:22.984 --> 01:58:25.326]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[01:58:25.546 --> 01:58:27.247]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[01:58:27.447 --> 01:58:30.089]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[01:58:30.349 --> 01:58:34.872]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[01:58:35.212 --> 01:58:41.256]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[01:58:41.716 --> 01:58:46.239]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.860]  That helps with focus, too.
[01:58:48.281 --> 01:58:49.281]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[01:58:49.782 --> 01:58:53.904]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[01:58:54.305 --> 01:58:58.368]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[01:58:58.628 --> 01:59:00.169]  There's definitely been a change.
[01:59:00.429 --> 01:59:01.089]  For the better.
[01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:05.272]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[01:59:05.693 --> 01:59:07.354]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[01:59:07.774 --> 01:59:08.655]  I hope this lasts.
[01:59:09.495 --> 01:59:11.556]  One Eye Jack says, Alpha Power.
[01:59:11.837 --> 01:59:17.961]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes, I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[01:59:18.261 --> 01:59:23.204]  I take Super Male and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[01:59:23.664 --> 01:59:26.986]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[01:59:27.567 --> 01:59:29.168]  Taking one capsule a day in the a.m.
[01:59:29.468 --> 01:59:32.610]  And even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[01:59:33.151 --> 01:59:34.972]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[01:59:35.232 --> 01:59:35.752]  Not anymore.
[01:59:36.153 --> 01:59:37.333]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[01:59:37.914 --> 01:59:39.735]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[01:59:39.975 --> 01:59:41.356]  I will definitely buy this again.
[01:59:42.157 --> 01:59:45.479]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[01:59:46.159 --> 01:59:47.921]  That's infowarrestore.com.
[01:59:56.585 --> 02:00:00.426]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:00.606 --> 02:00:01.206]  Mother!
[02:00:24.023 --> 02:00:30.551]  Simon Roche is a leader of a Christian organization, and I've studied the factions and things.
[02:00:30.591 --> 02:00:31.452]  It's very fascinating.
[02:00:31.472 --> 02:00:36.959]  I've read quite a few books on it in South Africa, and how the country got set up, the different factions that were involved in Zulu.
[02:00:37.079 --> 02:00:37.419]  We're good.
[02:01:07.025 --> 02:01:10.668]  Folks that went to South Africa, and now they're announcing they're going to kill you.
[02:01:10.688 --> 02:01:11.589]  They are killing you.
[02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:14.351]  The second largest party says they're going to start killing you.
[02:01:15.052 --> 02:01:19.956]  The president says, no, we're just going to take their land and just throw you out into the bushes.
[02:01:20.877 --> 02:01:22.278]  And you got really mad earlier.
[02:01:22.298 --> 02:01:24.399]  And I wasn't trying to get you riled up.
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:26.641]  I was just saying, why not evacuate?
[02:01:26.721 --> 02:01:28.323]  And you got pretty animated there.
[02:01:28.363 --> 02:01:31.385]  So tell us who you are for people out there watching.
[02:01:31.425 --> 02:01:32.046]  Quantify that.
[02:01:32.066 --> 02:01:32.846]  This is a short segment.
[02:01:32.866 --> 02:01:33.547]  We'll come back to the next.
[02:01:35.208 --> 02:01:37.190]  Talk about why you're so dedicated.
[02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:43.635]  Well, our organization is called SAITlanders, which means Southlanders.
[02:01:44.215 --> 02:01:59.627]  We are the largest non-state owned civil defense organization in the world and we're constituted under international law, particularly protocols one and two additional to the Geneva Conventions, which make specific provision for identifiable ethnic groups to
[02:01:59.727 --> 02:02:02.669]  That's right, the communists run the Defense Department in South Africa now.
[02:02:27.935 --> 02:02:28.656]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:29.136 --> 02:02:36.301]  Bear in mind that the African National Congress political party is actually only one-third of a greater organization.
[02:02:36.461 --> 02:02:44.227]  One-third of it is the political party, one-third of it is a trade union organization, and one-third of it is the South African Communist Party.
[02:02:44.267 --> 02:02:46.168]  Indeed, Nelson Mandela remains...
[02:02:46.308 --> 02:02:51.389]  Well, they've always been the heart of it, for those that don't know, but expanding on this, the left always does this everywhere.
[02:02:51.809 --> 02:03:00.690]  They say, whether it's just an issue between communists and capitalists, or whether it's black or white, they say, be liberal, let us take over, we'll be sweet.
[02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:01.971]  Then they always enslave and kill.
[02:03:02.271 --> 02:03:05.251]  Venezuela, it's not even cultural, it's political.
[02:03:05.531 --> 02:03:06.711]  They were as rich as the U.S.
[02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:08.052]  or richer, just like Argentina.
[02:03:08.352 --> 02:03:10.432]  Now they're eating out of trash everywhere.
[02:03:10.832 --> 02:03:11.692]  Total collapse.
[02:03:12.072 --> 02:03:15.613]  Thousands are dying a week from starvation, but the government passed a law
[02:03:16.013 --> 02:03:17.802]  Where you can't call it starvation.
[02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:19.510]  I mean, this is what communists do.
[02:03:20.854 --> 02:03:22.475]  This is what they do, Alex.
[02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:24.376]  They always do it and there's never an exception.
[02:03:24.756 --> 02:03:32.040]  And you can see it, and I say this in humility and respect, you can see it in certain United States cities that I visited for six months last year.
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:38.323]  The trend is so clear and so consistent and so reliable and so dependable, there's just no argument to be held about this.
[02:03:38.923 --> 02:03:46.627]  Our goal is to safeguard the welfare of non-competent civilians in a crisis which we are preparing for right now.
[02:03:47.268 --> 02:03:51.914]  We're going to go to break, but give us a timeline.
[02:03:51.954 --> 02:03:53.937]  Ten years ago, people didn't listen to you.
[02:03:53.957 --> 02:03:55.980]  Now, everybody's listening because it's happening.
[02:03:57.267 --> 02:03:57.948]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:03:58.068 --> 02:03:58.789]  People are listening.
[02:03:59.229 --> 02:04:03.634]  And we are trying desperately, last minute, to try and prepare for it.
[02:04:03.674 --> 02:04:06.617]  And that's why we are begging the world to support us.
[02:04:06.657 --> 02:04:14.084]  We just started a free-starter campaign in the USA with Charles C. Johnson and the support of some American senators.
[02:04:14.625 --> 02:04:17.308]  And we are imploring people, please help us.
[02:04:17.368 --> 02:04:18.589]  We desperately need help.
[02:04:18.889 --> 02:04:20.411]  There is big trouble coming here.
[02:04:22.253 --> 02:04:25.135]  And we got George Soros in the WikiLeaks wants to overthrow Israel.
[02:04:25.155 --> 02:04:30.619]  And, and, and, and, I mean, it's just, it's, it's every Western little enclave is about to be annihilated.
[02:04:30.659 --> 02:04:31.500]  Why do you think that is?
[02:04:33.442 --> 02:04:37.943]  It's a thing that goes back thousands and thousands and thousands of years, Alex.
[02:04:38.323 --> 02:04:40.844]  This fight between good and evil is unrelenting.
[02:04:41.404 --> 02:04:42.405]  It's nothing special.
[02:04:42.465 --> 02:04:43.465]  It's nothing original.
[02:04:44.605 --> 02:04:46.206]  I see that you've just brought up the campaign.
[02:04:46.266 --> 02:04:48.786]  It kicked off about half an hour ago.
[02:04:48.806 --> 02:04:51.587]  And yeah, there you've got it there.
[02:04:51.827 --> 02:04:53.468]  And we just have to keep up the fight.
[02:04:53.488 --> 02:04:54.768]  We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[02:04:54.948 --> 02:04:57.369]  By the way, we're in the same position, so we need support as well.
[02:04:57.389 --> 02:04:59.089]  But who will support you like last time?
[02:04:59.509 --> 02:05:01.690]  Because they're trying to shut us down ahead of persecution.
[02:05:04.187 --> 02:05:11.410]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:05:29.976 --> 02:05:32.597]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:33.612 --> 02:05:38.335]  Make no mistake, we've made some major gains against the Globalists, but they're striking back all over the world.
[02:05:38.615 --> 02:05:44.159]  Now more than ever is the time to get prepared with the highest quality emergency supplies across the board.

[02:06:19.823 --> 02:06:23.746]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:24.807 --> 02:06:29.510]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:40.077 --> 02:06:42.859]  Simon Roche runs the biggest civil defense group in the world.
[02:06:42.879 --> 02:06:47.023]  It's basically Dutch, quasi-Amish.
[02:06:48.368 --> 02:06:51.549]  And a lot of them have been overrun, a lot of them have been killed.
[02:06:52.209 --> 02:06:58.571]  Just like in five other African nations, Zimbabwe the most famous, there were, what, something like a million white farmers there.
[02:06:58.611 --> 02:06:59.671]  Then it fell down to less than 20,000.
[02:06:59.731 --> 02:07:02.372]  They were still producing almost all the country's food.
[02:07:02.812 --> 02:07:03.773]  Now they're all gone.
[02:07:04.313 --> 02:07:11.195]  Just a few years ago that the government raided the houses and mainly killed a few thousand elderly that
[02:07:11.795 --> 02:07:12.496]  Just couldn't leave.
[02:07:12.596 --> 02:07:15.699]  They'd already given the farms over, the tractors, everything.
[02:07:15.719 --> 02:07:17.441]  They usually would move them into like a shed.
[02:07:17.461 --> 02:07:19.703]  And they just came in and blew their heads off.
[02:07:20.024 --> 02:07:21.505]  And the national TV celebrated.
[02:07:22.366 --> 02:07:23.087]  Because it's liberal!
[02:07:23.427 --> 02:07:25.449]  You know, white people must be racist and bad.
[02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:28.573]  And now the country has completely collapsed into total hell on earth.
[02:07:29.373 --> 02:07:29.473]  And...
[02:07:30.856 --> 02:07:43.462]  I just don't think the average leftist realizes that this whole communist programming and trying to make blacks racist and turn everybody against each other here in America is a communist tactic and that Mandela was a communist.
[02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:55.848]  His wife famously would line up children and put tires over their heads, put gasoline in and burn them up and sit there and go, while they did it.
[02:07:57.185 --> 02:07:58.550]  This is who we're told to worship.
[02:07:58.590 --> 02:08:00.556]  You'll get rid of one thing, apartheid.
[02:08:01.698 --> 02:08:02.518]  That I think was bad.
[02:08:02.538 --> 02:08:06.540]  But you have to understand, it's a total barbarous state with different groups.
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:08.901]  The British came in and took control of it and exploited it.
[02:08:08.921 --> 02:08:10.742]  I'm not bashing Brits, I'm Welsh.
[02:08:11.022 --> 02:08:12.083]  The point is the British Empire.
[02:08:12.683 --> 02:08:19.666]  And then you think of Afrikaners and other groups that were already there, in many cases living in peace with the natives, who wanted them to come in and create agriculture and jobs.
[02:08:20.186 --> 02:08:25.649]  And then now you've got black racist nationalist communists saying, kill the whites, we just played that last hour.
[02:08:25.949 --> 02:08:27.210]  This is a nightmare situation.
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:29.941]  You should support them.
[02:08:30.462 --> 02:08:32.124]  Their plight is very, very serious.
[02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.587]  And it's something that our media won't even cover.
[02:08:34.827 --> 02:08:37.130]  Remember all the free South Africa stuff?
[02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:38.351]  Well, I was for that.
[02:08:39.012 --> 02:08:41.334]  But I knew that it didn't need to be replaced with communism.
[02:08:41.354 --> 02:08:44.438]  It needed to be replaced with a more equitable free market system.
[02:08:44.478 --> 02:08:45.880]  That hasn't been done.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.722]  The multinationals are being more exploited than ever.
[02:08:48.742 --> 02:08:54.025]  They just get private mercenaries to guard the very mines instead of actually investing in the country.
[02:08:54.465 --> 02:09:03.011]  I've seen numbers that investment from the mines and investment from the big industrial agricultures plummeted under black rule.
[02:09:03.311 --> 02:09:03.932]  I'm going to say that again.
[02:09:04.012 --> 02:09:07.094]  The black leaders are keeping the money for themselves.
[02:09:07.854 --> 02:09:12.457]  Not like the white leaders who were sharing power were putting it back in because they live there.
[02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:13.818]  Stabilize things.
[02:09:13.898 --> 02:09:14.839]  Let's have a nice life.
[02:09:15.419 --> 02:09:15.560]  No.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:20.224]  So, again, they're replacing one bad thing with something 50 times worse.
[02:09:20.484 --> 02:09:21.945]  We'll talk to him in a moment, but listen, folks.
[02:09:23.046 --> 02:09:27.771]  A lot of people have called me, friends, family, neighbors, and they've said, how are you taking it?
[02:09:29.493 --> 02:09:37.620]  Thousands of articles saying that I, it's all over TV, saying Alex Jones sexually assaulted male and female employees.
[02:09:38.241 --> 02:09:41.244]  And then you actually read the EEOC complaint and it says,
[02:09:42.924 --> 02:09:45.987]  One time Jones hugged me and might have touched me a little bit on my butt.
[02:09:46.147 --> 02:09:46.667]  Not even true.
[02:09:47.088 --> 02:09:48.349]  And that sexual assault...
[02:09:50.899 --> 02:09:51.920]  I mean, it's not true!
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:57.823]  And then we're doing a bodybuilding shoot for a supplement ad, and I'm in a major editing suite with four different computers.
[02:09:58.483 --> 02:10:03.006]  I'm like, he doesn't look right, because later in the thing, you know, he rips his shirt off like Hulk Hogan and Shane Steiner.
[02:10:03.846 --> 02:10:07.729]  And, kind of fast forward it, because it comes back with him with his shirt off and, you know, with the girls.
[02:10:08.429 --> 02:10:10.170]  And this is homoerotic, they're claiming.
[02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:13.272]  And we were Googling how to light a bodybuilder.
[02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:16.294]  Because he was saying, man, it doesn't show my ripped chest for that shot right there.
[02:10:17.214 --> 02:10:20.076]  And I guess the light wasn't right, but we just couldn't figure it out.
[02:10:20.456 --> 02:10:21.897]  That, and it says it!
[02:10:22.337 --> 02:10:29.021]  He came in, he saw it, he ran over to HR, they come and they go, Rob, it says, how to like bodybuilding, and it's bodybuilders.
[02:10:29.461 --> 02:10:31.402]  We have that written up in HR!
[02:10:31.742 --> 02:10:34.624]  This is now national news that I was grooming him!
[02:10:34.804 --> 02:10:40.467]  He says, Jones never asked me to go out with him, Jones never asked me for sex, Jones never nothing!
[02:10:40.747 --> 02:10:42.388]  This is a guy I've had over for Thanksgiving!
[02:10:42.628 --> 02:10:45.749]  Three or four times, because he was a loner, and I kind of felt sorry for him.
[02:10:46.110 --> 02:10:49.611]  And he was kind of a smart writer in ways, but he was always too frustrated.
[02:10:50.231 --> 02:10:55.554]  And so Rob's a smart guy, but he just went downhill, and I really feel sorry for him.
[02:10:55.854 --> 02:10:59.635]  I mean, when you read the complaint, it says we wear Nazi shoes.
[02:11:01.596 --> 02:11:02.396]  What is that?
[02:11:02.416 --> 02:11:07.719]  Somebody mailed in things of Hillary with a Nazi symbol on her, some Japanese lady that sewed the shoes for us.
[02:11:08.686 --> 02:11:09.466]  I'm trying to find them.
[02:11:09.486 --> 02:11:12.167]  So much stuff comes in the mail room, but it doesn't matter.
[02:11:12.187 --> 02:11:20.350]  The media takes the EEOC complaint that's twisted and weird and deceptive, and it takes it and then ups its game.
[02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:26.672]  Like the Prairie Home Companion guy, the woman hugged him, her shirt went up, and she said she touched her skin.
[02:11:27.353 --> 02:11:28.093]  And they fired him.
[02:11:29.258 --> 02:11:30.539]  They're just setting a precedent.
[02:11:31.079 --> 02:11:33.300]  Meanwhile, you got all the pedophilia in Hollywood and the rest of it.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:34.441]  So financially support us.
[02:11:34.841 --> 02:11:36.201]  We have to have a legal defense fund.
[02:11:36.221 --> 02:11:39.363]  Listen, the best defense is a good offense.
[02:11:39.723 --> 02:11:41.864]  I've already launched stuff major this morning.
[02:11:42.445 --> 02:11:46.166]  If we have to do this and don't up the amount of money coming in, it will cut into production.
[02:11:46.467 --> 02:11:47.567]  It'll cut into operations.
[02:11:47.647 --> 02:11:50.829]  It'll cut into our reach and exposing news that they don't want to expose.
[02:11:50.869 --> 02:11:53.090]  We can't let them get us in a shrinking mode.
[02:11:53.590 --> 02:11:55.431]  Last year, they banned us off Google Advertising.
[02:11:55.471 --> 02:11:56.592]  That cost us $5 million.
[02:11:56.652 --> 02:11:58.113]  You came through, you bought.
[02:11:58.173 --> 02:12:02.016]  It was just this same time, February, March last year.
[02:12:02.376 --> 02:12:10.242]  You came back, and within three months of extra orders and donations, we raised the $5 million it takes to run this.
[02:12:11.283 --> 02:12:12.744]  I'm going up on extra satellites.
[02:12:13.004 --> 02:12:14.745]  Affiliates are picking us up like crazy.
[02:12:14.785 --> 02:12:15.666]  The globalists know this.
[02:12:15.686 --> 02:12:16.126]  They're scared.
[02:12:16.146 --> 02:12:17.307]  This show is exploding.
[02:12:17.687 --> 02:12:21.290]  But, it's exploding in the people we reach, not in money.
[02:12:22.409 --> 02:12:26.133]  Okay, so people on TV, UHF, VHF cable watching us, they're not really buying stuff.
[02:12:26.393 --> 02:12:31.058]  It's talk radio, it's the Christian audience, it's patriots, it's that dedicated small percentage.
[02:12:31.999 --> 02:12:35.102]  I need you, you've done so much, to stand in the way of these.
[02:12:35.443 --> 02:12:37.345]  I'm ready to take the next stuff they make up.
[02:12:37.445 --> 02:12:39.026]  I'm ready to, if they kill me, I'm ready.
[02:12:39.147 --> 02:12:43.972]  I'm not saying Rob and his lawyers, I'm saying, you know, Hillary and the globalists, because, I mean, this is serious.
[02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:45.551]  I'm ready.
[02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:46.692]  And it's not because I'm a hero.
[02:12:46.852 --> 02:12:48.194]  I know I can't give in to them.
[02:12:48.294 --> 02:12:49.274]  I know I can't back down.
[02:12:49.295 --> 02:12:51.276]  I understand why he doesn't want to try to evacuate.
[02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:54.038]  I was just asking the Devil's Advocate question out of South Africa.
[02:12:54.059 --> 02:12:58.002]  Even though the President's announcing we're going to take your land, and the Defense Minister says we're going to kill you.
[02:12:59.123 --> 02:12:59.463]  Okay?
[02:13:00.164 --> 02:13:01.985]  Once we put you in camps.
[02:13:02.125 --> 02:13:05.008]  Now that's actually the Communist plan.
[02:13:05.468 --> 02:13:07.029]  They always want to put their opposition in camps.
[02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:08.771]  So infowarestore.com.
[02:13:08.791 --> 02:13:09.812]  30 to 80% off.
[02:13:10.132 --> 02:13:12.294]  But a lot of these, at 80% off,
[02:13:13.956 --> 02:13:14.917]  Those are clearance items.
[02:13:14.937 --> 02:13:17.500]  T-shirts that are great, but for some reason, nope, never sold.
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:18.761]  Or a lot of other stuff.
[02:13:18.821 --> 02:13:21.163]  Brand new, best supplements, 50% off.
[02:13:21.784 --> 02:13:24.787]  Like our new Super Fiber, Best Fiber, Probiotic Fiber.
[02:13:25.107 --> 02:13:25.588]  It's all there.
[02:13:25.628 --> 02:13:26.929]  We need the financing.
[02:13:26.949 --> 02:13:29.692]  But when you go to Infowars.com, a pop-up pops up.
[02:13:29.992 --> 02:13:33.556]  Or you go to Infowars.com forward slash show, you'll see a donate button.
[02:13:33.876 --> 02:13:34.517]  And I need...
[02:13:35.558 --> 02:13:39.199]  The middle class folks, the wealthy people, the folks that have never said, hey, we need the money.
[02:13:39.319 --> 02:13:43.160]  I'm going to call people like Gary Haven today, who's offered me money before.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.121]  And I've said, no, we're doing all right selling product.
[02:13:46.781 --> 02:13:47.462]  He offered me $50,000 once.
[02:13:48.122 --> 02:13:51.103]  And I said, no.
[02:13:51.183 --> 02:13:52.003]  And then he gave me $20,000.
[02:13:52.723 --> 02:13:55.424]  And then I'm going to call Gary and I'm going to say, Gary, I need the money.
[02:13:55.904 --> 02:13:57.304]  And Mike Adams offered money.
[02:13:57.464 --> 02:13:59.025]  People don't know Mike Adams is bigger than we are.
[02:13:59.944 --> 02:14:00.805]  Global he's huge.
[02:14:01.125 --> 02:14:29.344]  He is bigger when it comes to actual numbers than we are Mike Mike's called yesterday before he's coming on He said I want to donate so I'm gonna get on the phones I'm gonna raise a bunch of money, but I need you to load us up with money right now I need you to support local affiliates send them a hundred bucks a month as well I need you to put your calendar to tithe the info wars so we can support pastors and groups all over the world people defending freedom defending freedom of speech and exposing all the evil that's going on, but we're under attack and
[02:14:30.444 --> 02:14:34.186]  So far, we've brought in less money than we brought in last year at this time.
[02:14:34.206 --> 02:14:34.946]  $500,000 less.
[02:14:34.966 --> 02:14:43.270]  I met with the accountants yesterday and I'm looking at a very aggressive program because I've got to stop this now while they're trying to pay people.
[02:14:43.670 --> 02:14:44.631]  Because I talked to Daily Mail.
[02:14:44.651 --> 02:14:45.891]  They wouldn't deny that they were paying.
[02:14:47.192 --> 02:14:54.255]  I've got to let folks know that, listen, we've got to have... I'm not going to say what we're going to do.
[02:14:54.315 --> 02:14:56.336]  It's all legal and lawful, but it's very aggressive.
[02:14:58.510 --> 02:15:00.451]  They want to fight, they better believe they got one.
[02:15:00.491 --> 02:15:02.112]  And that includes everybody involved.
[02:15:02.773 --> 02:15:03.894]  That includes everybody.
[02:15:04.694 --> 02:15:06.355]  Uh, so I need a lot of money.
[02:15:06.435 --> 02:15:07.236]  I need it right now.
[02:15:07.916 --> 02:15:12.679]  And I commit to you a hundred percent of the money that comes in and donations and product sales this week.
[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:16.922]  We'll go to, I mean, already 95% of the money comes in here and goes to this operation.
[02:15:17.122 --> 02:15:19.964]  Then I build up money to fight them and do this and that.
[02:15:20.004 --> 02:15:21.385]  Cause you know, we gotta have some backup money.
[02:15:21.445 --> 02:15:23.407]  I don't give a rat's ass about things.
[02:15:23.827 --> 02:15:25.648]  I care about ideas and defeating the globalists.
[02:15:25.668 --> 02:15:28.350]  We're gonna come back with our guests, finish up the final segment, but I'm just telling you.
[02:15:29.570 --> 02:15:30.771]  This is a total war.
[02:15:30.851 --> 02:15:32.011]  They're taking off the gloves.
[02:15:32.111 --> 02:15:32.632]  You see it.
[02:15:32.692 --> 02:15:34.152]  You saw all the attacks this week.
[02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:35.613]  They took more of our sponsors.
[02:15:35.653 --> 02:15:36.313]  That's in the news.
[02:15:36.653 --> 02:15:38.234]  They tried to ban us off the internet.
[02:15:38.574 --> 02:15:39.895]  They're lying about who we are.
[02:15:40.395 --> 02:15:42.175]  They already tried to take my kids away.
[02:15:42.256 --> 02:15:43.276]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:15:43.376 --> 02:15:44.897]  I'm just saying this is a war.
[02:15:45.217 --> 02:15:48.738]  We're up against authoritarians and their useful idiots and their minions.
[02:15:48.818 --> 02:15:51.699]  And this is Hillary Clinton's former main lawyer.
[02:15:52.159 --> 02:15:53.020]  He brags about it.
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.201]  Is the person running this suit and the whole EEOC thing.
[02:15:56.601 --> 02:15:57.982]  And they admit the thing's political.
[02:15:58.522 --> 02:16:00.407]  They say we're full of crap and we need to be exposed.
[02:16:00.427 --> 02:16:00.848]  Yeah, right.
[02:16:00.888 --> 02:16:01.249]  We'll be back.
[02:16:06.089 --> 02:16:07.469]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:16:07.529 --> 02:16:08.950]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.370]  Go ahead.
[02:16:09.490 --> 02:16:09.770]  Yes.
[02:16:10.210 --> 02:16:10.950]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:11.050 --> 02:16:17.231]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:16:17.451 --> 02:16:21.432]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:16:21.652 --> 02:16:23.112]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:16:23.472 --> 02:16:30.173]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:16:30.253 --> 02:16:33.114]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:16:33.214 --> 02:16:38.696]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:16:38.736 --> 02:16:46.558]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:16:46.578 --> 02:16:52.400]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:57.842]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:16:57.942 --> 02:17:00.943]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:17:02.779 --> 02:17:10.446]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:17:11.327 --> 02:17:15.390]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:17:15.891 --> 02:17:18.233]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:17:19.034 --> 02:17:22.157]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:17:23.655 --> 02:17:35.799]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:51.545]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[02:17:58.546 --> 02:18:00.947]  You are funding the information war in 2018.

[02:18:12.989 --> 02:18:20.271]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[02:18:21.031 --> 02:18:27.354]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[02:20:05.862 --> 02:20:08.453]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:31.131 --> 02:20:38.979]  Looking at the disinfo, there are thousands of articles a day coming out lying about me because they think if they can destroy us, they can destroy you.
[02:20:38.999 --> 02:20:42.563]  Because they see this broadcast as the resurgence of America.
[02:20:43.003 --> 02:20:44.144]  We support Christianity.
[02:20:44.184 --> 02:20:45.305]  We support basic justice.
[02:20:45.326 --> 02:20:46.206]  But we're also open.
[02:20:46.647 --> 02:20:47.608]  We're also inclusive.
[02:20:48.529 --> 02:20:49.129]  Here's the cut.
[02:20:50.017 --> 02:20:54.019]  Four psychology experiments on why Alex Jones is always taking his shirt off.
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:57.962]  Well, that violates the Goldwater rule of diagnosing somebody from afar.
[02:20:58.482 --> 02:21:02.705]  That's a violation of the code of the American Psychological Association, but they don't care.
[02:21:03.805 --> 02:21:12.811]  I've taken my shirt off probably five, six times in 23 years on air, and I do it as stunts like Hulk Hogan.
[02:21:15.132 --> 02:21:19.535]  Like, where I'm a Hillary supporter that goes crazy and has to be restrained, so I pull my shirt off.
[02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:22.030]  Because it's an anti-Hillary shirt?
[02:21:22.270 --> 02:21:23.290]  It's an ad for the shirt.
[02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:24.931]  He sold almost 100,000 of them.
[02:21:25.251 --> 02:21:25.671]  It worked.
[02:21:26.351 --> 02:21:28.512]  Then I showed how I lost some weight when I was really fat.
[02:21:29.693 --> 02:21:32.754]  And then I've had people, listeners, take pictures of me.
[02:21:33.214 --> 02:21:35.315]  Like, some of those were taken by tabloids.
[02:21:35.815 --> 02:21:38.476]  Like, I'm in Hawaii, and they're taking pictures of me.
[02:21:41.177 --> 02:21:42.978]  Or once I went out in the snow and jumped in water.
[02:21:42.998 --> 02:21:44.219]  I mean, everybody else does it, too.
[02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:48.020]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:21:48.701 --> 02:21:49.641]  Everybody else does it.
[02:21:51.235 --> 02:21:55.577]  So, if I lose 30 pounds, I'm going to show you a picture like everybody else does.
[02:21:56.457 --> 02:21:59.198]  But then they go through, it's a show of dominance, it's all this other crap.
[02:21:59.758 --> 02:22:02.339]  No, it's called doing a show and it's called having some fun.
[02:22:03.519 --> 02:22:09.562]  So, we've got communists saying murder conservatives, murder libertarians, murder Trump, murder all the whites in South Africa.
[02:22:10.022 --> 02:22:12.843]  And their answer is how bad we are because I take my shirt off.
[02:22:14.582 --> 02:22:16.143]  It is simply incredible.
[02:22:16.643 --> 02:22:17.984]  And they never let us respond to it.
[02:22:18.004 --> 02:22:18.824]  They make false charges.
[02:22:18.884 --> 02:22:23.607]  All right, Simon Roche of the Southlanders Civil Defense Group.
[02:22:23.667 --> 02:22:29.450]  He was here with us last year, over six months ago, and he warned that the new president was about to get in.
[02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:33.712]  He said he wanted to take all the land from white settlers who'd been there 400 years in some cases.
[02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:36.394]  He has the emergency plan, the only one of its kind in the world.
[02:22:36.954 --> 02:22:40.195]  Well, we have a good plan, we have good membership and we have lots of experience, training and skills.
[02:23:02.328 --> 02:23:09.051]  Unfortunately, in the New South African Rainbow Nation, as the Liberals call it, we are persona non grata.
[02:23:09.091 --> 02:23:11.012]  It's very difficult for us to raise money.
[02:23:11.452 --> 02:23:15.975]  People have lost their jobs for less than supporting an organisation like us.
[02:23:16.555 --> 02:23:29.661]  So we are asking for people to help us financially so that we can purchase diesel fuel, medicine, food, tents and clothing for women, children, the elderly and the disabled.
[02:23:30.504 --> 02:23:33.587]  We need support from the whole world.
[02:23:34.127 --> 02:23:35.568]  I have just received a message.
[02:23:35.628 --> 02:23:36.529]  I'll quote it to you.
[02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:40.472]  Julius Malema, who you had on earlier, says the following.
[02:23:42.014 --> 02:23:48.339]  We want to teach these white people we mean business about property expropriation without compensation.
[02:23:48.379 --> 02:23:52.683]  He then went on to say in front of a very excited audience.
[02:23:55.405 --> 02:23:58.608]  We are going for your white man to cut the throat.
[02:24:00.596 --> 02:24:04.804]  And we just played him saying, you know, we're not going to kill you quite yet, but now he's saying that.
[02:24:05.225 --> 02:24:09.854]  In your country, the defense minister you pay taxes to says he's coming to racially murder you.
[02:24:11.485 --> 02:24:12.305]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:24:12.806 --> 02:24:15.407]  Alex, things are reaching a crisis now.
[02:24:15.447 --> 02:24:18.209]  It has been building up for a long, long time, very gradually.
[02:24:18.669 --> 02:24:29.875]  Indeed, our new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who you also had on earlier, is famous for having said some years ago, we are going to treat the whites like a frog in hot water.
[02:24:29.975 --> 02:24:36.358]  We're going to boil them so slowly they won't realise until it's too late and then they'll be dead.
[02:24:37.276 --> 02:24:38.578]  That's the situation we're in.
[02:24:38.618 --> 02:24:43.724]  It has been building up to this point and now we're about to hit the wall at a hundred miles an hour.
[02:24:43.744 --> 02:24:46.067]  A big crisis is coming here.
[02:24:46.087 --> 02:24:47.569]  We have never been wrong.
[02:24:47.589 --> 02:24:49.471]  Well, you can see that he's hyping people up.
[02:24:49.531 --> 02:24:55.439]  He's getting them ready to obviously invigorate the Communist Party so it completely takes over and then has a red terror.
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:01.704]  Well, it's exactly as Dr. Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch in Washington D.C.
[02:25:01.744 --> 02:25:01.944]  said.
[02:25:01.985 --> 02:25:03.866]  He said, this is the path that they follow.
[02:25:04.267 --> 02:25:09.151]  And right towards the end, they use this dramatic rhetoric to get the blood racing.
[02:25:10.914 --> 02:25:13.015]  Well, let me say this.
[02:25:13.335 --> 02:25:19.136]  When somebody says, we're coming to kill you because of your race, and they're a defense minister, I'm not calling for this.
[02:25:19.196 --> 02:25:24.518]  But generally, if somebody ends up taking this guy out, he asked for it, and everybody around him.
[02:25:24.558 --> 02:25:28.319]  And when they say, we're coming to kill you and your family because you're white, I'm the defense minister.
[02:25:28.339 --> 02:25:29.579]  He has that power to do it.
[02:25:30.359 --> 02:25:33.520]  He needs to be removed right now, because this is unbelievable.
[02:25:35.229 --> 02:25:37.511]  Oh, Alex, it's not unique.
[02:25:37.551 --> 02:25:39.533]  It's a she as it happens, but it's not unique.
[02:25:39.953 --> 02:25:47.919]  You know, in the middle of last year... Well, I'm confused that Julius Malema, leader of the Marxist opposition, we played the clip earlier, he said, we're gonna, you know, we're not gonna kill you all yet.
[02:25:47.959 --> 02:25:52.783]  And you were just quoting, I guess, one of his adjuncts, because these names escape me.
[02:25:52.803 --> 02:25:54.284]  Go back and just be clear.
[02:25:54.544 --> 02:25:55.405]  Who said the latest?
[02:25:57.226 --> 02:25:59.648]  The latest is from Julius Malema.
[02:25:59.708 --> 02:26:03.591]  I beg your pardon, I thought you were talking about the defense minister, which is a she.
[02:26:04.838 --> 02:26:06.719]  Okay, so she's doing it too.
[02:26:06.779 --> 02:26:08.700]  Julius Malema is the leader of the Marxists.
[02:26:10.001 --> 02:26:10.661]  That's right.
[02:26:10.801 --> 02:26:14.683]  So you've got the defense minister, you've got... Okay, I thought it was just him doing it.
[02:26:14.903 --> 02:26:20.667]  So you've got the defense minister, you've got the number two party, you've got the president saying take your land.
[02:26:20.727 --> 02:26:21.267]  Good God!
[02:26:23.077 --> 02:26:24.579]  And boil them alive like frogs.
[02:26:24.719 --> 02:26:25.920]  And it doesn't end there.
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:51.241]  The head of the Constitutional Court, the brother of one of our former presidents, the head of the African National Congress' private militia, of which Nelson Mandela was head, the very famous terrorist organization Nkontowe Sizwe, which means the spear of the nation, in the middle of last year, said, it is time now for blacks to come to training camps in the bush
[02:26:51.821 --> 02:26:54.402]  To learn to fight whites in a civil war.
[02:26:54.422 --> 02:26:57.543]  There are many people who are talking about this, Alex.
[02:26:58.203 --> 02:27:05.565]  But again, it happens in every African country where the whites are basically pushed into a minority position.
[02:27:05.585 --> 02:27:06.606]  Zimbabwe, you name it.
[02:27:07.266 --> 02:27:08.506]  Why do you think you're going to be different?
[02:27:08.546 --> 02:27:10.107]  Because you're ready for it?
[02:27:10.147 --> 02:27:10.787]  You've seen history?
[02:27:12.879 --> 02:27:15.020]  It's not that it's going to be different.
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.280]  We're going to suffer very, very badly.
[02:27:17.461 --> 02:27:25.443]  But we happen to be a group of people, and there are many of us, who are willing to stand for what's right because it's not acceptable.
[02:27:25.503 --> 02:27:30.165]  And to leave here and to emigrate to America or Australia or New Zealand is not the solution.
[02:27:30.525 --> 02:27:39.548]  For our children to be exposed to the same perversity and pornography and abortion and drugs that is being implemented in all of the European-derived societies around the world.
[02:27:40.968 --> 02:27:49.010]  To be clear, you're basically living a very Amish lifestyle, very close to that, a Mennonite, just out there producing food for the rest of the country.
[02:27:50.350 --> 02:27:54.091]  What percentage do the white farmers produce still in South Africa?
[02:27:54.111 --> 02:27:56.611]  I know previously it was a tiny minority produced the majority.
[02:27:59.212 --> 02:28:06.553]  You know, there are only about 40,000 white farms, of which 21,000 are now for sale, believe it or not.
[02:28:06.893 --> 02:28:07.573]  I read the figures.
[02:28:07.893 --> 02:28:10.274]  So there is a massive evacuation now taking place?
[02:28:11.613 --> 02:28:24.076]  Well, people are terrified, but we, the whites in South Africa produce, I'm estimating, but I'll estimate conservatively, very, very easily, 70% of the food consumed in this country.
[02:28:24.096 --> 02:28:27.197]  And that's what's crazy, in every country they kick you out and then it collapses.
[02:28:27.277 --> 02:28:29.798]  Why doesn't, why don't they have the Wakandan dream?
[02:28:29.838 --> 02:28:31.398]  Why doesn't that happen?
[02:28:32.717 --> 02:28:37.420]  Because the notion of the goose that lays the golden egg is a fallacy in certain cultures.
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:42.482]  We have a tendency, as white people around the world, to say, we see things this way, so they should too.
[02:28:42.883 --> 02:28:46.845]  No, it's a different culture, different values, different norms, different mores.
[02:28:47.165 --> 02:28:56.850]  And there is a notion in Africa that it is better to have 100% of 10, in other words, to control everything, than to have 10% of a million.
[02:28:57.271 --> 02:28:59.972]  In other words, to have more, but to be sharing.
[02:29:00.733 --> 02:29:01.333]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:03.504 --> 02:29:10.726]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:29:11.206 --> 02:29:20.349]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[02:29:20.629 --> 02:29:25.750]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[02:29:26.010 --> 02:29:28.851]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[02:29:29.271 --> 02:29:31.972]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:29:32.995 --> 02:29:36.857]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:29:37.418 --> 02:29:44.822]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:29:45.523 --> 02:29:50.226]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:29:50.846 --> 02:29:52.747]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:29:53.368 --> 02:29:56.790]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:29:57.610 --> 02:30:00.072]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:30:00.732 --> 02:30:07.417]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:30:07.997 --> 02:30:15.222]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:30:16.082 --> 02:30:22.769]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:30:23.310 --> 02:30:24.411]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:30:24.751 --> 02:30:26.613]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:30:27.414 --> 02:30:30.397]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:30:30.918 --> 02:30:32.640]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:33.635 --> 02:30:38.479]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:43.964]  DNA Force protects your body from the toxic environment that surrounds us all.
[02:30:44.104 --> 02:30:48.547]  The powerful ingredients include Thio-PQQ and Coenzyme Q10.
[02:30:48.787 --> 02:30:53.271]  Protect yourself against dangerous free radicals, optimize cellular energy.
[02:30:54.052 --> 02:30:54.953]  It's DNA Force.
[02:30:55.013 --> 02:30:56.874]  It's available for a limited time only.
[02:30:57.635 --> 02:31:01.058]  Get yours today, right now, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:07.552 --> 02:31:12.554]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified Libtards on Twitter.
[02:31:12.654 --> 02:31:15.316]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[02:31:15.396 --> 02:31:21.379]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[02:31:21.399 --> 02:31:23.740]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:32.084]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[02:31:32.164 --> 02:31:35.045]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[02:31:35.465 --> 02:31:45.130]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:48.472]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[02:31:48.572 --> 02:31:56.276]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:56.316 --> 02:31:57.337]  Brain Force Plus.
[02:31:57.417 --> 02:31:59.478]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[02:31:59.518 --> 02:32:00.718]  It was hilarious.
[02:32:02.639 --> 02:32:04.861]  They wrote it at vice.com!
[02:32:04.961 --> 02:32:14.767]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley take some kind of nootropic.
[02:32:14.807 --> 02:32:17.229]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[02:32:17.829 --> 02:32:24.253]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[02:32:24.894 --> 02:32:26.455]  I'm gonna go after Joe Rogan too.
[02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:33.946]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[02:32:34.006 --> 02:32:36.089]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[02:32:36.109 --> 02:32:37.651]  You're gonna get triggered over this?
[02:32:37.731 --> 02:32:37.991]  Good.
[02:32:38.231 --> 02:32:39.553]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[02:32:39.713 --> 02:32:44.439]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[02:32:44.719 --> 02:32:46.802]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[02:32:47.222 --> 02:32:49.584]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[02:32:49.924 --> 02:32:52.826]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[02:32:52.866 --> 02:32:54.367]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[02:32:54.447 --> 02:32:55.368]  BrainForce Plus.
[02:32:55.428 --> 02:32:58.510]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:06.836 --> 02:33:09.458]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.175 --> 02:33:17.616]  We are on the march.
[02:33:18.016 --> 02:33:20.437]  The empire is on the run.
[02:33:21.157 --> 02:33:24.899]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:29.081 --> 02:33:37.064]  There is a global corporate government that's free market, that pays zero taxes, and is ultimate capitalist, but in a crony fashion.
[02:33:38.445 --> 02:33:41.486]  Obama traveled to Africa, he traveled to South America just two years ago.
[02:33:41.506 --> 02:33:42.567]  I remember he gave the speech saying,
[02:33:43.413 --> 02:33:45.195]  Now, now, now, now to graduate students.
[02:33:45.655 --> 02:33:49.178]  Communism's good for you, but then capitalism's good internationally.
[02:33:50.119 --> 02:33:53.963]  Now, I don't do a good imitation, but you're going to be communist, meaning you're a slave.
[02:33:54.323 --> 02:33:55.624]  You can't have air conditioning or cars.
[02:33:55.924 --> 02:33:58.086]  He actually said that in Africa, in three different speeches.
[02:33:59.748 --> 02:34:01.870]  But then we're going to be rich and fly around on jet airplanes.
[02:34:01.930 --> 02:34:06.094]  But it's for the environment, and then you pay your money to us, and then we're exempt.
[02:34:07.691 --> 02:34:12.632]  Amazon's owner is worth $115 billion last time I checked.
[02:34:12.672 --> 02:34:15.012]  He makes a billion dollars every three days profit.
[02:34:16.533 --> 02:34:22.594]  The company, separate from him, made $5.6 billion last year and paid zero tax.
[02:34:24.634 --> 02:34:28.755]  Now these virtue signalers pay no tax, just like Warren Buffett basically pays none.
[02:34:29.195 --> 02:34:33.656]  Google pays almost none, because they set it up, but then they tell you the middle class didn't pay enough.
[02:34:34.795 --> 02:34:35.476]  And it's the same thing.
[02:34:35.916 --> 02:34:45.225]  Then they fund communists to take over, because it'll be one communist kingpin with the military, and they just pay off that person, maybe a half a billion dollars every decade.
[02:34:45.245 --> 02:34:47.988]  A lot of these African countries, they buy them off for a couple hundred million.
[02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:51.270]  And they can exploit everything.
[02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:56.811]  As long as the leaders get tribal and say, kill the white man, they can stay in power.
[02:34:56.831 --> 02:35:06.113]  But what's happened in a bunch of countries, as soon as all the whites are dead, it doesn't work because there's, I mean, they celebrated in Zimbabwe when the last white farmer two years ago got killed.
[02:35:06.593 --> 02:35:10.574]  And now the leader's out, finally, because they're like, there is no more white man.
[02:35:11.174 --> 02:35:11.674]  Where is it?
[02:35:11.734 --> 02:35:12.754]  We want all this money.
[02:35:13.094 --> 02:35:14.074]  Everything's bankrupt.
[02:35:15.394 --> 02:35:16.915]  That is exactly what happens.
[02:35:17.535 --> 02:35:18.735]  But I don't want to see
[02:35:20.097 --> 02:35:21.158]  The Afrikaners leave.
[02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:22.860]  I don't want to see the Southlanders leave.
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:24.442]  But most of them have already left.
[02:35:24.462 --> 02:35:24.922]  You heard that.
[02:35:25.282 --> 02:35:27.425]  Half the farms of 40,000 are up for sale.
[02:35:28.426 --> 02:35:33.832]  I don't blame them, but I get also sticking to it because when you've been bullied so much, you have nowhere else to go.
[02:35:35.097 --> 02:35:39.100]  They have attacked me, and I don't usually do this on the show, but I mean, look what it's like now.
[02:35:39.501 --> 02:35:45.245]  It's like, they said, you know, Rush Limbaugh said that they were trying to promote black quarterbacks over white quarterbacks.
[02:35:45.485 --> 02:35:48.748]  Whether that was true or not, they tried to boycott him and remove him ten years ago.
[02:35:49.468 --> 02:35:58.496]  Now we've moved on to, Alex hugged me once and his hand went down a little far, and then that's not even true, and then the news calls it sex assault.
[02:36:00.151 --> 02:36:10.039]  And then there's bodybuilding on a computer, because we're trying to light a bodybuilding shoot, and that becomes gay porn, and that becomes gay, uh, what was it called?
[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:12.161]  Being groomed!
[02:36:13.302 --> 02:36:15.184]  I mean, can you imagine?
[02:36:16.144 --> 02:36:18.206]  Can you imagine how ridiculous?
[02:36:18.226 --> 02:36:19.267]  But they don't care.
[02:36:20.168 --> 02:36:21.669]  It's the headlines.
[02:36:21.689 --> 02:36:24.732]  Look how ridiculous I look right there.
[02:36:26.073 --> 02:36:28.375]  The point is, is that, is that
[02:36:29.537 --> 02:36:30.477]  This is out of control.
[02:36:30.497 --> 02:36:32.518]  We're going to go to our next guest who they're attacking as well.
[02:36:32.918 --> 02:36:34.358]  And I just thank the listeners in the audience.
[02:36:34.398 --> 02:36:36.918]  And we're in the middle of a 34-hour broadcast.
[02:36:37.878 --> 02:36:41.199]  We're now, I don't know, five hours or so into it.
[02:36:41.219 --> 02:36:42.559]  Because it started when David Knight kicked off.
[02:36:43.099 --> 02:36:43.779]  I was saying that wrong.
[02:36:43.799 --> 02:36:44.700]  We're into hour number one.
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:45.100]  No, no.
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:46.460]  They're like, no, Alex, add three to it.
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.020]  David was on.
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:47.680]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:50.261]  We'll be live right through 6 o'clock tomorrow.
[02:36:50.281 --> 02:36:51.461]  We're already live 10 hours a day.
[02:36:51.521 --> 02:36:52.261]  I promise to expand.
[02:36:52.281 --> 02:36:53.561]  We've got the satellite up links.
[02:36:53.621 --> 02:36:55.081]  All the TV stations are starting to pick us up.
[02:36:55.121 --> 02:36:56.222]  I'm ready to announce that, too.
[02:36:56.242 --> 02:36:57.862]  I've got to go to our next guest here.
[02:36:59.381 --> 02:37:00.682]  Guys, they gave me the new satellite.
[02:37:01.302 --> 02:37:02.783]  Satellite Galaxy 16.
[02:37:03.083 --> 02:37:04.964]  It's on fullworks.com forward slash shub.
[02:37:06.885 --> 02:37:11.567]  Galaxy 16 at 99.0 W.
[02:37:11.707 --> 02:37:12.948]  24 hours a day in HD.
[02:37:14.328 --> 02:37:17.530]  And that is Galaxy 16 in geosynchronous orbit.
[02:37:18.450 --> 02:37:19.991]  Right over the equator, but straight over the Earth.
[02:37:20.451 --> 02:37:22.052]  So it's like this from the building.
[02:37:22.072 --> 02:37:22.812]  It's right there.
[02:37:23.693 --> 02:37:25.233]  And that baby is right over.
[02:37:25.534 --> 02:37:26.034]  And then we've got
[02:37:27.588 --> 02:37:28.429]  14 over here.
[02:37:28.489 --> 02:37:33.592]  We're going to get this other one and that's going to hit Europe and Africa.
[02:37:34.353 --> 02:37:35.794]  So we're like over the U.S.
[02:37:35.854 --> 02:37:40.657]  and then out over here into Asia and then blasting into Europe and then into most of Africa.
[02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:42.719]  And I mean, it's on, folks.
[02:37:42.759 --> 02:37:43.579]  We're in a fight here.
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:47.142]  And industry people go, why do you want to be on in Africa?
[02:37:47.162 --> 02:37:48.663]  Why do you want to be on in Asia?
[02:37:48.723 --> 02:37:50.724]  You don't get any orders from there, any sponsorship.
[02:37:51.245 --> 02:37:52.426]  Our sponsorship's freedom.
[02:37:53.146 --> 02:37:54.968]  There's no real voice of America anymore.
[02:37:55.108 --> 02:37:56.469]  We've got to do it, people.
[02:37:57.089 --> 02:37:58.410]  And so that's why we're under attack.
[02:37:58.491 --> 02:37:59.732]  We're the real voice of America.
[02:37:59.752 --> 02:38:03.194]  We're promoting basic Americana, good values, free market.
[02:38:04.576 --> 02:38:07.858]  We're fighting communism, and we're under hellish attack.
[02:38:07.938 --> 02:38:11.021]  But again, I take that as being over the target.
[02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:13.523]  Both my grandfathers were in the Army Air Corps in World War II.
[02:38:13.603 --> 02:38:14.384]  Both almost died.
[02:38:14.404 --> 02:38:15.405]  One in a crash landing.
[02:38:16.957 --> 02:38:29.850]  And then my other grandfather was out of North Africa bombing the Germans in Italy and he got a heat stroke and he'd been over 20 missions already and volunteered for more, you know, catch 22.
[02:38:30.631 --> 02:38:36.717]  And then they put another pilot in, he was a pilot, and the plane blew up over Sicily
[02:38:37.608 --> 02:38:42.452]  Bombing German targets and he always talked about how guilty he was that he had that heatstroke out working and digging.
[02:38:42.472 --> 02:38:51.380]  They're actually digging trenches for when the Germans were strafing him in North Africa and he was out there all day in between missions because they'd have you fly a few missions, have a few days off.
[02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:52.140]  He had a heatstroke.
[02:38:52.621 --> 02:38:54.643]  It was actually the kind of stroke like the sun in the eyes they said.
[02:38:54.663 --> 02:38:55.744]  They called it heatstroke.
[02:38:56.044 --> 02:38:58.126]  He was out for like a week when he got up from it.
[02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:02.497]  Uh, they also said they were drinking the fuel out of rockets.
[02:39:02.597 --> 02:39:06.599]  That was, there was not enough liquor, so the army was drinking rocket fuel.
[02:39:06.859 --> 02:39:14.242]  That's a whole nother subject, because it was probably the rocket fuel, but drinking the rocket fuel while they were digging ditches, uh, and he wasn't the only one doing it.
[02:39:14.262 --> 02:39:17.884]  Uh, that probably saved his life, because the B-17, no, he's fine.
[02:39:17.924 --> 02:39:18.464]  Liberator's time.
[02:39:18.484 --> 02:39:19.464]  Then it was B-17's after that.
[02:39:19.804 --> 02:39:25.267]  The Liberator, uh, they called it the flying coffin, because it blew up so easily, uh, because of where they held the bombs.
[02:39:25.607 --> 02:39:26.907]  His, his whole crew got killed.
[02:39:27.287 --> 02:39:28.108]  So the point is, I'm...
[02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:32.872]  I don't know how I went into this whole story, but that's what our forebears did.
[02:39:33.212 --> 02:39:36.214]  This is 21st century war where they attack your family, they attack your name.
[02:39:36.694 --> 02:39:38.055]  I mean, I went up against Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:38.075 --> 02:39:39.515]  We really took her down.
[02:39:39.576 --> 02:39:40.256]  You took her down.
[02:39:40.596 --> 02:39:42.677]  And so I expected hit teams to come in here.
[02:39:42.697 --> 02:39:47.520]  That's why I got guys, you know, on the roof with guns and, you know, all the rest of it, because they have sent some people over here.
[02:39:48.444 --> 02:39:49.204]  That's not how they're doing it.
[02:39:49.744 --> 02:39:53.885]  They're doing it with disinfo and all this stuff, so I'm not happy it's happening.
[02:39:53.905 --> 02:39:58.166]  I'm sorry they're saying horrible things about the crew that isn't true, because they know it's not getting to me, so they're going to start going after you.
[02:39:58.186 --> 02:39:58.766]  I'm just warning you.
[02:39:59.887 --> 02:40:02.927]  And that's why we got the infiltrators or operatives in here now, folks.
[02:40:02.947 --> 02:40:03.667]  You got to tell me about it.
[02:40:03.687 --> 02:40:04.227]  You got to watch it.
[02:40:04.548 --> 02:40:06.248]  Because they'll try to set you up.
[02:40:06.288 --> 02:40:07.708]  I mean, this is 21st century war.
[02:40:08.048 --> 02:40:08.788]  We need your prayers.
[02:40:08.808 --> 02:40:09.349]  We need your help.
[02:40:09.369 --> 02:40:09.789]  We thank you.
[02:40:10.109 --> 02:40:11.829]  Going back to my guest, Simon Roche.
[02:40:11.849 --> 02:40:15.630]  We're on the same page as Southlander with the extermination of the president.
[02:40:16.772 --> 02:40:17.773]  Announcing they're taking your land.
[02:40:17.793 --> 02:40:19.855]  The defense minister announcing they're going to kill you.
[02:40:21.737 --> 02:40:24.180]  The number two minister, the communist, announcing they're going to kill you.
[02:40:25.461 --> 02:40:27.964]  Our media, total media dead silence on this.
[02:40:28.725 --> 02:40:30.987]  The apartheid dream is over.
[02:40:31.427 --> 02:40:32.529]  Now the dream of Mandela.
[02:40:32.589 --> 02:40:34.551]  Mandela, like Winnie, says kill all the whites.
[02:40:35.191 --> 02:40:38.215]  We're right back to where we were with Mandela bombing white schools.
[02:40:40.014 --> 02:40:41.675]  Yeah, we're back.
[02:40:41.715 --> 02:40:43.335]  We've kind of come full circle.
[02:40:43.355 --> 02:40:55.320]  You know, we're in a situation where the chickens have come home to roost and we've got to deal with realities of unemployment and AIDS and massive corruption that, with all due respect, Alex, you couldn't even begin to imagine.
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:58.522]  That's a whole different story that would take hours to tell.
[02:40:59.302 --> 02:41:03.764]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions being plundered all of the time.
[02:41:04.504 --> 02:41:04.945]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:41:27.742 --> 02:41:42.834]  About one of Trump's, the main article, the lead article, one of Trump's ladies assistants, whatever, I don't know what her role was, is leaving because she's achieved what she wants to achieve, in her words, but then tried to make it into a scandal.
[02:41:42.934 --> 02:41:50.801]  And yet BBC will not cover that in one of the top 40 countries in the world, the world with the largest by far
[02:41:53.990 --> 02:42:10.244]  ...mineral reserves in the world, namely South Africa, the country that controls the southern sea routes should the Suez Canal ever be closed down, is now passing a motion to confiscate all white-owned property without compensation.
[02:42:10.265 --> 02:42:10.765]  It's incredible.
[02:42:10.785 --> 02:42:11.486]  We're out of time.
[02:42:11.526 --> 02:42:12.186]  We're out of time.
[02:42:12.226 --> 02:42:17.351]  Tell folks the website for radio, not just TV viewers, how they go donate for your civil defense.
[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:20.862]  Please donate at freestarter.org.
[02:42:20.962 --> 02:42:26.888]  It's an American organization, a crowdfunding organization owned by Charles Johnson.
[02:42:27.268 --> 02:42:28.950]  It's freestarter.org.
[02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:37.318]  Our own website is, and you can donate there too via PayPal, is safelanders.org.
[02:42:40.044 --> 02:42:42.246]  All right, thank you, brother.
[02:42:42.266 --> 02:42:42.786]  We're out of time.
[02:42:42.826 --> 02:42:43.687]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:42:43.747 --> 02:42:44.307]  Incredible.
[02:42:44.347 --> 02:42:45.588]  You predicted it all last year.
[02:42:45.648 --> 02:42:46.189]  It's happening.
[02:42:46.629 --> 02:42:48.570]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:52.673]  We need to really raise massive funds to fight these allegations or they'll be successful.
[02:42:52.973 --> 02:42:55.535]  InfoWarsTore.com, 30% to 80% off storewide.
[02:42:55.835 --> 02:42:57.136]  Right now, it's a total war.
[02:42:57.516 --> 02:42:59.238]  The Second American Revolution is global.
[02:43:08.979 --> 02:43:14.283]  My good friend, I've gotten to know him really well over the years, knew his dad before I even knew him, Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[02:43:14.303 --> 02:43:17.246]  He's got a new film we'll talk about in the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[02:43:17.626 --> 02:43:27.894]  Hollywood free, made in Texas, funded in Texas, and then of course the big films you produced for Hollywood, but also for cable television, Lifetime, Hallmark, you name it.
[02:43:28.475 --> 02:43:33.059]  Very successful, but now you've got The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde sitting back, the state of the world,
[02:43:33.719 --> 02:43:40.043]  I mean, I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there was really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[02:43:40.363 --> 02:43:41.784]  The world has really changed.
[02:43:42.064 --> 02:43:45.766]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[02:43:46.487 --> 02:43:47.768]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[02:43:48.548 --> 02:43:50.329]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[02:43:50.669 --> 02:43:55.012]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[02:43:55.412 --> 02:43:57.153]  And I think the elites are going down.
[02:43:57.674 --> 02:44:00.455]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[02:44:00.475 --> 02:44:01.596]  And I'm happy to be alive.
[02:44:01.636 --> 02:44:02.757]  I'm proud to witness it.
[02:44:04.139 --> 02:44:05.240]  Making America great again.
[02:44:05.540 --> 02:44:09.364]  You've made films about the globalists, the New World Order, you've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[02:44:10.905 --> 02:44:13.988]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[02:44:14.328 --> 02:44:15.209]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:15.229 --> 02:44:20.574]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did America, and that was such a large film, it took
[02:44:20.934 --> 02:44:21.674]  That's already happened!
[02:44:40.484 --> 02:44:41.725]  It's starting, it's starting.
[02:44:41.765 --> 02:44:49.688]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood, but the government, everything.
[02:44:50.348 --> 02:44:52.509]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil.
[02:44:53.069 --> 02:44:56.210]  And the devil is after believers all over the country.
[02:44:56.330 --> 02:45:01.812]  And we've got to be prepared and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[02:45:02.112 --> 02:45:04.213]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[02:45:04.994 --> 02:45:08.355]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[02:45:08.635 --> 02:45:13.837]  And we've got all the public statements by Antifa about rising up, taking over, triggering something for martial law.
[02:45:14.617 --> 02:45:16.158]  This is really what they're pushing.
[02:45:16.198 --> 02:45:19.479]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[02:45:20.259 --> 02:45:25.641]  When you see them failing, though, on every front, when you see Soros starting to fail, what do you think they're going to do next?
[02:45:25.661 --> 02:45:27.041]  They're not going to give up.
[02:45:27.121 --> 02:45:29.022]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[02:45:29.042 --> 02:45:31.283]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[02:45:31.323 --> 02:45:32.143]  They're not going to give up.
[02:45:32.743 --> 02:45:45.552]  Um, I'm a little nervous to see, you know, what the millennials, so to say, um, you know, I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[02:45:45.912 --> 02:45:51.275]  So, a little curious to see what happens with them, but you know what?
[02:45:51.355 --> 02:45:53.757]  We're going to kick their butts everywhere.
[02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:55.478]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[02:45:55.758 --> 02:45:57.840]  We are going to win this battle.
[02:46:03.045 --> 02:46:07.890]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:12.634]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:46:12.975 --> 02:46:21.323]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:46:21.663 --> 02:46:25.006]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics and
[02:46:25.146 --> 02:46:30.087]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:46:30.387 --> 02:46:37.368]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:46:37.689 --> 02:46:41.309]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:46:41.609 --> 02:46:45.950]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:46:46.330 --> 02:46:49.911]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[02:46:50.231 --> 02:46:54.094]  And a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:46:54.414 --> 02:46:58.336]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[02:46:58.616 --> 02:46:59.917]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:47:24.577 --> 02:47:27.719]  Sometimes it's good to have an open mic when you don't know it's live.
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:31.362]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:47:33.244 --> 02:47:38.548]  It hurts me so bad what Trump's doing that I'm not holding back to defend him.
[02:47:38.828 --> 02:47:40.269]  I'm kind of shell-shocked right now.
[02:47:41.970 --> 02:47:52.999]  It always takes me about six, seven hours to process some big betrayal and then I just connect to God and then it's all okay and I'm ready to move forward.
[02:47:54.557 --> 02:47:57.300]  And I don't think Trump's betraying us, but these clips are sickening.
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:01.864]  I only played a few of them first hour and I really should have been doing this whole show, but we're under so much attack.
[02:48:02.364 --> 02:48:06.788]  You've got Andrew Torba of Gab that Google's called to be shut down.
[02:48:06.808 --> 02:48:13.194]  They're not just censoring you off Google platforms, they're censoring people saying, oh, this is hate, you'll have ISPs block it.
[02:48:13.554 --> 02:48:14.175]  That's in the news.
[02:48:14.215 --> 02:48:17.498]  And then Gab is just a true don't be evil.
[02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:25.635]  Where there's liberal, conservative, you know, pagans, Christians, all on there.
[02:48:25.835 --> 02:48:26.896]  And they're nice to us.
[02:48:26.916 --> 02:48:28.057]  You know, they have our stuff on there.
[02:48:28.077 --> 02:48:30.639]  We're going to start posting some more videos to the platform they're doing.
[02:48:30.659 --> 02:48:31.200]  We're doing one.
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:32.240]  Mike Adams is doing one.
[02:48:33.201 --> 02:48:34.562]  I'm all about us having our internet.
[02:48:34.582 --> 02:48:38.646]  But they're going after our credit card companies.
[02:48:38.666 --> 02:48:39.867]  They're going after our bank companies.
[02:48:40.107 --> 02:48:41.108]  They're making an example.
[02:48:41.148 --> 02:48:42.049]  They think you're cowards.
[02:48:43.009 --> 02:48:45.792]  And they think that if they can destroy me or destroy Trump,
[02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:51.592]  And make us give in to them, that they're gonna win.
[02:48:51.993 --> 02:48:53.954]  And all I know is I can't give in to bullies.
[02:48:55.015 --> 02:48:56.657]  It's just, I'm not a pig-headed person.
[02:48:57.457 --> 02:49:00.860]  I got beat up a lot when I was, you know, in the 5th and 6th grade.
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:05.844]  But I hit puberty right about the 6th grade, and a couple years later that changed.
[02:49:05.864 --> 02:49:07.926]  And you know, I'm not a vengeful person.
[02:49:07.946 --> 02:49:16.913]  A few of the guys that beat me up a few years later, you know, a couple of them I put, one guy was in a coma for two weeks, and I shouldn't have done it, and I was like 14, and you know,
[02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:20.551]  Slammed his head in the concrete a few times after he tried to beat me up again.
[02:49:20.571 --> 02:49:22.732]  I remember his mom was so mad and everything else.
[02:49:22.792 --> 02:49:25.373]  I'm like, he's on record starting to fight with me, lady.
[02:49:26.234 --> 02:49:31.556]  And, you know, so all I know is I'm not going to roll over.
[02:49:31.796 --> 02:49:32.957]  And we're going to win.
[02:49:33.037 --> 02:49:33.537]  We're winning.
[02:49:34.237 --> 02:49:36.438]  But even if Trump goes sideways, we're not stopping.
[02:49:36.478 --> 02:49:42.521]  So Andrew Torba joins us right now with all the censorship he's under, everybody else
[02:49:46.345 --> 02:49:46.745]  Look at this.
[02:49:46.805 --> 02:49:47.285]  Exclusive.
[02:49:47.305 --> 02:49:51.406]  Trump's Facebook engagement declined by 45% following an algorithm change.
[02:49:51.446 --> 02:49:53.807]  No, they're... That's breaking right now.
[02:49:54.747 --> 02:49:57.067]  I've talked to the president about this the last time.
[02:49:57.127 --> 02:49:58.368]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:49:58.388 --> 02:49:59.568]  They make a big deal about it when I talk to them.
[02:50:00.288 --> 02:50:01.268]  Stone's talked to him.
[02:50:02.068 --> 02:50:07.269]  I know for a fact a member of his club, good friends with him, Chris Ruddy, talks to him every time about this.
[02:50:08.010 --> 02:50:09.330]  And the president just doesn't get it.
[02:50:09.350 --> 02:50:10.310]  He goes, well, I'm still on the air.
[02:50:10.370 --> 02:50:11.750]  I'm still... They're not going to censor me.
[02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:12.450]  Yes, sir.
[02:50:12.490 --> 02:50:14.651]  They're censoring all the places we magnify you.
[02:50:15.782 --> 02:50:22.426]  He thinks the guy with the beard or whatever, you know, this dude that ran the internet stuff before is the reason he won, because Kushner told him.
[02:50:22.446 --> 02:50:26.768]  And I'm not against Kushner, but the guy's the reason you won if you want to pick somebody.
[02:50:26.808 --> 02:50:28.209]  His name's Matt Drudge.
[02:50:28.729 --> 02:50:30.070]  He's not the guy with the beard.
[02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:33.291]  You know, like an Afrikaner outfit, but he's not from Africa.
[02:50:34.552 --> 02:50:38.474]  So, public wants big tech regulated.
[02:50:38.494 --> 02:50:39.715]  That's a big Axios story.
[02:50:40.737 --> 02:50:43.579]  Facebook keeps creepy secret files on everybody.
[02:50:43.619 --> 02:50:44.239]  We already knew that.
[02:50:44.899 --> 02:50:47.721]  So let's go to Andrew Torbel, keep him some of the next hour.
[02:50:47.741 --> 02:50:48.781]  I apologize, I'm ranting.
[02:50:49.061 --> 02:50:53.124]  We've got 30 to 80% off storewide, but that isn't enough to fund us, because a lot of that's lost leaders.
[02:50:53.444 --> 02:51:00.307]  Biggest sales ever, InfoWareStore.com during this 34-hour Paul Revere emergency broadcast that we were already doing because of this, but now it's totally an emergency.
[02:51:00.627 --> 02:51:01.428]  We need you to donate.
[02:51:01.828 --> 02:51:08.872]  You go to the Support Us link on InfoWareStore.com on the front page, and the bottom thing is Donate right there, right over the right-hand side.
[02:51:09.332 --> 02:51:16.081]  It says InfoWarsLife, health and wellness, preparedness, media, gear, specials, and support us.
[02:51:16.682 --> 02:51:18.424]  And when you hit, click support us so we can show people.
[02:51:19.065 --> 02:51:20.607]  And then that goes down to donations.
[02:51:22.301 --> 02:51:23.461]  We need people to donate.
[02:51:23.702 --> 02:51:27.643]  And by the way, I've never done this where I actually call rich donors that I know are out there.
[02:51:27.663 --> 02:51:31.365]  Oh, it's happening today because we have to defend the First Amendment.
[02:51:31.385 --> 02:51:39.728]  We have to get on the offense because I can't just let people say that we're wearing Nazi tennis shoes and that we hate Jews and all these other lies and just made up crap.
[02:51:39.768 --> 02:51:41.369]  We have to go after this because
[02:51:42.671 --> 02:51:47.713]  Again, the Daily Mail wouldn't deny paying money, and that is next level.
[02:51:48.473 --> 02:51:50.894]  So, we're on it like Donkey Kong.
[02:51:50.994 --> 02:51:54.795]  Okay, gab.ai, Andrew Torbut joins us.
[02:51:54.955 --> 02:51:58.677]  Andrew, what would you say about the point in life we are right now?
[02:51:58.717 --> 02:52:00.097]  This is a crazy period.
[02:52:00.737 --> 02:52:02.578]  The assault is just exponential.
[02:52:04.679 --> 02:52:07.221]  Well, Alex, I've been at this for about two years now.
[02:52:07.861 --> 02:52:11.824]  I used to live and work with these companies in Silicon Valley.
[02:52:11.844 --> 02:52:17.588]  I have many patriot friends that still work inside of these companies and feed me and us information.
[02:52:18.109 --> 02:52:20.931]  And I've been predicting this stuff for about a year now.
[02:52:21.851 --> 02:52:23.112]  It is only going to get worse.
[02:52:23.272 --> 02:52:27.135]  They are going to continue to censor and stop the free flow of information.
[02:52:27.615 --> 02:52:29.136]  They are going to continue to
[02:52:30.877 --> 02:52:33.398]  ...President Trump from getting his message out to the people.
[02:52:33.798 --> 02:52:35.039]  You just pulled up an article before.
[02:52:35.359 --> 02:52:43.242]  Facebook made an algorithm change earlier this year and they claim that they want to connect you more with your friends and family for your own well-being.
[02:52:43.622 --> 02:52:45.623]  And this is the new narrative of Silicon Valley.
[02:52:45.663 --> 02:52:49.504]  They're focused on the well-being and the mental health of their users.
[02:52:53.237 --> 02:52:53.477]  Right.
[02:52:53.558 --> 02:53:00.987]  Apparently these smug Silicon Valley elites know what's best for us normal, average, everyday, blue-collar, working-class people.
[02:53:02.089 --> 02:53:03.811]  It's really astonishing what's happening.
[02:53:03.831 --> 02:53:11.401]  You know, we see Hillary Clinton tweet earlier this week that we should all care about how social media platforms play a part in our democratic process.
[02:53:11.961 --> 02:53:14.064]  And she actually makes a veiled threat here.
[02:53:14.124 --> 02:53:16.847]  She says, unless it's addressed, it will happen again.
[02:53:16.867 --> 02:53:18.889]  And the midterms are in eight months.
[02:53:18.989 --> 02:53:21.713]  We owe it to our democracy to get this right and fast.
[02:53:21.933 --> 02:53:22.293]  That's right.
[02:53:22.313 --> 02:53:26.518]  Fix, fix, fix the internet so people can't communicate and decide they want free market.
[02:53:26.738 --> 02:53:27.759]  They've got to choose us.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:28.901]  They've got to choose the globalists.
[02:53:29.401 --> 02:53:35.128]  They've openly declared war and made the decision, and the corporations have done it, as News Corp said three weeks ago.
[02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:36.190]  They're a big part of this.
[02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:40.575]  Their CEO said, we met with all the tech heads, we decided to censor the web to make more money.
[02:53:40.896 --> 02:53:45.541]  So the real reason the companies are doing is, knock out all the real communication, have bots go out.
[02:53:45.862 --> 02:53:46.543]  This is amazing.
[02:53:48.687 --> 02:53:49.167]  Absolutely.
[02:53:49.287 --> 02:53:50.247]  And you know, it's sickening.
[02:53:50.267 --> 02:53:51.228]  This is their new narrative.
[02:53:51.308 --> 02:54:07.832]  Just days after Hillary tweeted this out, you have the Silicon Valley elites and these executives at Facebook and Twitter and Google coming out with this shared, similar, collective narrative of, oh, we're going to improve the experience to help with the well-being of users on our platforms.
[02:54:08.072 --> 02:54:19.766]  And it's your well-being to merge with the board, give up your consciousness, you want Hillary, you want S- and then they magnify all the SJW, kill the president, kill the white people crap.
[02:54:19.886 --> 02:54:20.687]  It is crazy.
[02:54:22.225 --> 02:54:22.685]  Absolutely.
[02:54:22.705 --> 02:54:27.688]  The double standards and the hypocrisy of big tech are disgusting, and of big media for that matter.
[02:54:28.169 --> 02:54:36.534]  If you are speaking, you know, hate speech towards whites or towards males or towards Christians, it's totally acceptable, right?
[02:54:36.614 --> 02:54:39.436]  That type of hate speech is allowed across all of these platforms.
[02:54:39.736 --> 02:54:39.896]  I'm
[02:54:59.188 --> 02:55:10.637]  And the Comedy Central goes, how American is three strikes?
[02:55:10.677 --> 02:55:17.043]  Well now censorship is American, and even Bloomberg reports now that they've removed the strikes and admit it's fake.
[02:55:17.303 --> 02:55:19.685]  So there was such a backlash to me, they've backed off.
[02:55:19.705 --> 02:55:21.887]  But here's the thing, everybody else is still getting banned.
[02:55:22.507 --> 02:55:25.230]  Mike Adams is having his YouTube ban, just happened to come on yesterday.
[02:55:26.171 --> 02:55:27.933]  Dr. Corsi's is, all these gun groups.
[02:55:28.173 --> 02:55:33.298]  So we made a big deal, our audience did, so they backed off on us, but they're not backing off on other people.
[02:55:35.655 --> 02:55:36.555]  That's absolutely right.
[02:55:36.595 --> 02:55:37.195]  We have you.
[02:55:37.215 --> 02:55:41.337]  You guys are coming on and you're using GabTV to stream and back up all of your videos over there.
[02:55:41.877 --> 02:55:44.597]  Let's announce that because we're going to partner with you.
[02:55:44.898 --> 02:55:46.358]  We're going to partner with Natural News.
[02:55:46.798 --> 02:55:47.858]  Everybody just has to start doing it.
[02:55:48.118 --> 02:55:49.259]  We did our own platform.
[02:55:49.719 --> 02:55:50.739]  Matt Drudge linked to it.
[02:55:51.179 --> 02:55:53.020]  We usually do our own videos, like 100,000, 200,000.
[02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:56.581]  It had 7 million views, the two videos, that they banned last Friday.
[02:55:56.801 --> 02:55:58.781]  And it showed that we didn't say what they said.
[02:55:59.061 --> 02:56:00.282]  We said real people died.
[02:56:00.322 --> 02:56:01.422]  They weren't crisis actors.
[02:56:01.642 --> 02:56:04.443]  But he was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the police stood down.
[02:56:05.063 --> 02:56:08.445]  And then YouTube had to remove the strikes because we were able to show it.
[02:56:10.787 --> 02:56:12.068]  This stuff is insanity.
[02:56:12.088 --> 02:56:16.330]  Over the past week, I've seen videos and people banned, videos removed.
[02:56:16.571 --> 02:56:21.494]  They were factual, real videos of one of the students speaking in his own words.
[02:56:21.534 --> 02:56:24.095]  It wasn't an opinion piece or any of this nature.
[02:56:24.436 --> 02:56:25.596]  It was his own words.
[02:56:25.656 --> 02:56:27.758]  It was him on camera saying these things.
[02:56:28.118 --> 02:56:29.199]  And they just scrubbed it.
[02:56:29.399 --> 02:56:31.300]  They completely removed it from the internet.
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:32.641]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:56:32.681 --> 02:56:41.827]  And meanwhile, you have students who are also in the school that are Pro 2A, that are not being verified by Twitter, that are not getting any media attention, that are being silenced in other ways.
[02:56:57.978 --> 02:56:58.065]  Yeah.
[02:56:59.821 --> 02:57:02.062]  It's disgusting, and people need to wake up.
[02:57:02.242 --> 02:57:03.403]  Your viewers need to wake up.
[02:57:03.703 --> 02:57:10.247]  Conservatives, Christians, Libertarians, Nationalists, Populists, anybody that is not far left, to be frank.
[02:57:10.567 --> 02:57:11.347]  We all need to wake up.
[02:57:11.367 --> 02:57:12.448]  Common sense Libertarians.
[02:57:12.508 --> 02:57:13.368]  This is a war.
[02:57:13.668 --> 02:57:22.913]  We have to fight on Facebook, Google, Twitter, everywhere, but we got to drive people to Gab.ai, to Infowars.com, to DrudgeReport.com, and realize this is the big fight.
[02:57:22.993 --> 02:57:23.353]  It's now.
[02:57:23.573 --> 02:57:24.754]  This is bigger than the election of 2016.
[02:57:25.154 --> 02:57:28.176]  That was just a beachhead that made them accelerate their plan, right?
[02:57:29.776 --> 02:57:36.782]  Absolutely, and this war is only going to escalate, and until we start building something new and supporting alternatives, it's not going to go away.
[02:57:37.842 --> 02:57:41.585]  And you know, you can talk about this when we come back, Google has said in the news they want him shut down.
[02:57:41.645 --> 02:57:45.408]  They lobby lying about him, saying it needs to be shut down, there's hate speech on there.
[02:57:45.649 --> 02:57:48.431]  So it's not just like it's their own platform, they want to shut everything down.
[02:57:49.111 --> 02:57:50.392]  They need to be busted up.
[02:57:55.942 --> 02:58:02.726]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[02:58:02.866 --> 02:58:04.707]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[02:58:04.867 --> 02:58:10.870]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[02:58:10.910 --> 02:58:21.376]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[02:58:21.396 --> 02:58:24.178]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[02:58:24.258 --> 02:58:41.690]  Well, I designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were going to come out with Cell Force because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price, and was able to develop Cell Force, and Group liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were going to come out with DNA Force Plus,
[02:58:42.310 --> 02:58:52.214]  You just use that name and do it, because this is such an incredible formula, and I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country, and so you were able to scale up and lower price, and I want to do that.
[02:58:52.594 --> 02:58:57.836]  He was so classy, he just said, you just put out DNA Force Plus as Shell Force, or vice versa.
[02:58:57.896 --> 02:58:59.957]  I was partnering with him on that, that's how classy he is.
[02:58:59.997 --> 02:59:01.957]  So, Shell Force is a limited run.
[02:59:02.037 --> 02:59:03.478]  When it's gone, it's gone.
[02:59:03.578 --> 02:59:08.460]  It will be called DNA Force Plus, because it's stronger than the old DNA Force.
[02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:10.461]  And it is less money.
[02:59:10.521 --> 02:59:15.784]  So it's a good deal normally at $149, like DNA Force was, and we'd sell it for $99 on sale.
[02:59:15.864 --> 02:59:17.385]  We're selling it for $70.45.
[02:59:18.546 --> 02:59:21.628]  Used to, that's almost what it cost to make a bottle of DNA Force.
[02:59:21.648 --> 02:59:24.650]  Well, now we've lowered the price on the ingredients by buying even more.
[02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:26.971]  Just as high quality, we're lowering it for you.
[02:59:26.991 --> 02:59:29.373]  This is the best deal ever on DNA Force.
[02:59:29.793 --> 02:59:32.515]  It's DNA Force Plus, but called Cell Force.
[02:59:32.975 --> 02:59:45.502]  Because we weren't going to step on groups toes, we just put out CellForce separately, with a similar name to DNAForce, and it's even stronger and a lower price, super high quality, promotes cellular energy production, supports optimal mental health, and so much more.
[02:59:45.822 --> 02:59:46.903]  And it supports the InfoWar.
[02:59:47.063 --> 02:59:49.445]  Get the best deal ever at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:59:54.387 --> 03:00:00.311]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.210 --> 03:00:09.995]  Surprise, surprise, surprise!
[03:00:10.957 --> 03:00:13.401]  Leftists want to ban free speech like they do everywhere else.
[03:00:14.443 --> 03:00:15.986]  Surprise, surprise, surprise!
[03:00:16.006 --> 03:00:18.330]  I'll tell you about it in a second.
[03:00:18.690 --> 03:00:20.273]  First, this message from...
[03:00:21.886 --> 03:00:22.606]  Very important rock band.
[03:00:22.626 --> 03:00:23.947]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:24.187 --> 03:00:25.347]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:25.827 --> 03:00:30.269]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.069 --> 03:00:33.930]  And Anthony Comey is coming up riding shotgun with us here in just a minute.
[03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:37.911]  Let's hear a little bit of this song, because metal health will cure you, man.
[03:00:38.311 --> 03:00:39.432]  Metal health will drive you mad.
[03:00:40.012 --> 03:00:41.512]  Metal health's what we all need.
[03:00:42.753 --> 03:00:44.333]  It's better than being a little gloveless weenie.
[03:00:47.794 --> 03:00:49.755]  Better than an axe grinder.
[03:00:49.795 --> 03:00:49.935]  Thanks.
[03:00:49.955 --> 03:00:50.355]  Higher driver.
[03:00:51.255 --> 03:01:00.816]  Mama says that I never, never mind her And I know brains, I'm insane The teacher says that I'm one of a kind
[03:01:12.925 --> 03:01:13.986]  VOTAL POWER!
[03:01:14.987 --> 03:01:17.589]  That means power for humanity, not these globalist control freaks.
[03:01:18.149 --> 03:01:20.631]  Free market will take us to the stars, and we all know it!
[03:01:21.232 --> 03:01:22.973]  Socialism will take us to hell!
[03:01:26.676 --> 03:01:30.879]  Look at this latest story on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:01:30.919 --> 03:01:31.320]  You knew it.
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:32.221]  Look at this guy.
[03:01:33.092 --> 03:01:38.294]  He's a beta that wants to be an alpha, but then he wants to do it by shutting down the level playing field.
[03:01:38.895 --> 03:01:41.056]  Man who sent white powder to Donald Trump Jr.
[03:01:41.416 --> 03:01:43.037]  is a far-left gun advocate.
[03:01:43.337 --> 03:01:48.999]  Facebook page shows support for the resistance, or the real resistance to you, and numerous other left-wing causes.
[03:01:49.499 --> 03:01:50.040]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:52.101]  We'll be talking about that article in a moment.
[03:01:52.441 --> 03:01:56.322]  Going back to Gab.ai creator Andrew Torbo, a creator just a few years ago.
[03:01:56.683 --> 03:01:58.964]  He was in Silicon Valley, very successful programmer.
[03:01:59.864 --> 03:02:01.487]  Google and others are calling for his banning.
[03:02:01.547 --> 03:02:05.113]  Who is the worst out of Facebook, Twitter, Google, all the Apple moving to China?
[03:02:06.395 --> 03:02:08.078]  Who is the worst of this combine?
[03:02:11.421 --> 03:02:13.563]  I would say that Twitter is probably one of the worst.
[03:02:14.064 --> 03:02:22.772]  We've had problems with Apple, we've had problems with Google, not allowing us to have apps on their app stores, which by the way, that's a duopoly.
[03:02:23.232 --> 03:02:25.034]  They control and own and operate.
[03:02:25.054 --> 03:02:26.876]  Oh yeah, $500,000 for not baking a gay cake.
[03:02:26.936 --> 03:02:29.679]  I'd bake the cake, I agree, but you let us have our damn apps.
[03:02:30.079 --> 03:02:31.320]  You don't keep us from the market.
[03:02:31.340 --> 03:02:31.901]  Make the app.
[03:02:32.541 --> 03:02:32.962]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:33.632 --> 03:02:34.953]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:02:34.993 --> 03:02:36.895]  Bake the cake, or how about make the app, right?
[03:02:36.935 --> 03:02:38.276]  Allow the app on the App Store.
[03:02:38.997 --> 03:02:40.138]  So here's the thing, Alex.
[03:02:40.198 --> 03:02:44.282]  I think that, you know, these companies, they need some form of regulation.
[03:02:44.302 --> 03:02:45.784]  The government needs to step in.
[03:02:45.864 --> 03:02:48.826]  And this is tough for me as a free market conservative, right?
[03:02:49.507 --> 03:02:53.050]  But that's where government comes in when it's free market, is to protect it.
[03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:56.314]  And by the way, national polls, since you mentioned uninterrupted, you're just totally on target.
[03:02:57.916 --> 03:03:02.966]  Axios, which is of course Politicos as they're discredited as a new name, Public wants Big Tech regulated.
[03:03:03.006 --> 03:03:03.627]  They are pissed.
[03:03:05.623 --> 03:03:06.344]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:03:06.364 --> 03:03:12.968]  The public sentiment is shifting rapidly, and this is actually something that both the left and the right agree on.
[03:03:13.288 --> 03:03:18.552]  We are both, on both sides of the political aisle, fed up with Big Tech and with Silicon Valley.
[03:03:18.832 --> 03:03:25.817]  Now, it may be for different reasons, and we may have different ideas of how to solve that problem, but... But the honeymoon with Big Tech is over.
[03:03:25.857 --> 03:03:26.638]  The honeymoon is over.
[03:03:26.658 --> 03:03:27.859]  Right.
[03:03:28.359 --> 03:03:29.740]  Absolutely, without a doubt.
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:31.021]  Keep going, sorry.
[03:03:32.992 --> 03:03:33.412]  Yeah.
[03:03:33.793 --> 03:03:33.913]  Wow.
[03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:56.712]  He sees the data firsthand.
[03:03:57.032 --> 03:04:02.298]  He better than anyone else knows what's happening and can see this happening right in the data, right in front of his face.
[03:04:02.338 --> 03:04:13.690]  So we're hoping to get in touch with him to be able to work together and expose what's going on and hopefully build a new platform for Trump supporters for the 2020 election because guess what?
[03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:15.272]  There being no platform everywhere else.
[03:04:15.891 --> 03:04:16.312]  I don't
[03:04:30.851 --> 03:04:31.231]  All of us.
[03:04:31.691 --> 03:04:33.912]  It's not about going, oh wait, we get the credit.
[03:04:33.952 --> 03:04:37.473]  It's about don't give credit where it ain't due, because then we'll lose.
[03:04:37.813 --> 03:04:38.473]  It's all of us.
[03:04:38.533 --> 03:04:39.474]  It's you being active.
[03:04:39.774 --> 03:04:41.474]  I don't like this one person, did it?
[03:04:41.854 --> 03:04:42.995]  That's a load of horse manure.
[03:04:43.455 --> 03:04:44.055]  It isn't Trump.
[03:04:44.095 --> 03:04:44.635]  It isn't Drudge.
[03:04:44.675 --> 03:04:45.095]  It isn't me.
[03:04:45.135 --> 03:04:46.196]  It's all of us together.
[03:04:46.216 --> 03:04:51.177]  And that's why all of you are so important to be active and not be passive and just think somebody else is handling it.
[03:04:51.197 --> 03:04:56.159]  But let's talk with a really smart guy, Andrew Torba of cab.ai, with our next co-host.
[03:04:57.239 --> 03:04:58.742]  About what do we do then?
[03:04:59.023 --> 03:05:00.165]  We know something's about to happen.
[03:05:00.205 --> 03:05:00.726]  What do we do?
[03:05:04.403 --> 03:05:05.124]  I'm so excited.
[03:05:05.144 --> 03:05:14.770]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:15.350 --> 03:05:20.534]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:20.854 --> 03:05:23.656]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:23.876 --> 03:05:32.622]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:34.743 --> 03:05:42.830]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:53.840]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:55.641]  It is amazing!
[03:05:57.043 --> 03:06:02.007]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:06:07.291 --> 03:06:11.341]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:06:11.662 --> 03:06:13.667]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:13.948 --> 03:06:14.590]  Alright!
[03:06:16.326 --> 03:06:21.507]  Andrew Torba of Gab, one of the only big independent social media networks that isn't censored.
[03:06:21.547 --> 03:06:22.308]  It's libertarian.
[03:06:22.328 --> 03:06:29.089]  They're better than pagans, Christians, Muslims, agnostics, libertarian, you know, communists, conservatives, liberals.
[03:06:29.570 --> 03:06:30.130]  It's all there.
[03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:36.612]  He's making some really great points and I'm ranting because I'm under total attack and I can feel the energy of the enemy intensifying.
[03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:41.173]  I can see it and it just has my will just rising to just uncontrolled levels.
[03:06:41.193 --> 03:06:41.433]  This is
[03:06:42.153 --> 03:06:44.194]  This is the animated contest that Liberty Jefferson talked about.
[03:06:44.714 --> 03:06:51.038]  I don't like the fact they're so evil and so bad, but their commitment to destroy us just absolutely sets my hair on fire.
[03:06:51.058 --> 03:06:53.319]  I mean, I've just got chills all over right now.
[03:06:53.719 --> 03:06:55.560]  I've got so much energy, it's unbelievable.
[03:06:55.580 --> 03:06:58.802]  And I'm glad they're admitting how evil they are.
[03:06:58.862 --> 03:07:00.242]  They want censorship net-wide.
[03:07:00.262 --> 03:07:01.583]  So we're talking about solutions.
[03:07:01.683 --> 03:07:02.704]  What does Trump do?
[03:07:03.824 --> 03:07:09.147]  Now, by the way, when Anthony Comey is done, I'm going to come back and be on a bunch for the next 30-something hours.
[03:07:09.167 --> 03:07:10.648]  We're doing a 34-hour broadcast.
[03:07:11.582 --> 03:07:13.144]  Is Trump betraying the Second Amendment?
[03:07:13.724 --> 03:07:17.368]  And the answer is, I know in my gut and intellectually, I've studied it.
[03:07:18.609 --> 03:07:18.830]  No.
[03:07:18.970 --> 03:07:29.080]  He has these free-flow listen sessions where he says what they want to hear, he says what others want to hear, and he says, hey, you may not get that, Dianne Feinstein, but put it in there and we'll see if it passes.
[03:07:29.935 --> 03:07:33.177]  He's being magnanimous, like, oh, let me hear what you want with the Dreamers.
[03:07:33.237 --> 03:07:36.139]  Maybe if they have been here 20 years and are not criminals, we'll have them.
[03:07:36.159 --> 03:07:41.682]  And they go, we want total legalization, even of felons, and total chain migration, and the end of the border is completely in UN control of everything.
[03:07:41.982 --> 03:07:43.163]  He goes, whoa, they got nothing.
[03:07:44.724 --> 03:07:45.984]  He showed them as unreasonable.
[03:07:46.064 --> 03:07:49.006]  I'm not just defending Trump, but you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:07:49.406 --> 03:07:57.211]  So far, we've gotten all this great reasonable stuff, and turned things back, and they hate him, and we're killing TPP, and the better jobs, the better stock market.
[03:07:58.424 --> 03:08:02.087]  But I gotta tell you, even though I get his tactic, the Second Amendment, he shouldn't do it.
[03:08:02.647 --> 03:08:12.113]  I can get it with dreamers and other issues, but not with this, because you can't say, oh, well, I want to get rid of the due process, you know, when somebody's a killer.
[03:08:12.173 --> 03:08:16.536]  The due process was he was already adjudicated nuts, it was on government drugs, he can't buy guns.
[03:08:16.937 --> 03:08:19.979]  Just like the shooter at the Texas church a few months ago.
[03:08:20.599 --> 03:08:25.643]  He'd been adjudicated in a mental institution, insane, escaped from it, and the Air Force didn't put it in the database.
[03:08:26.323 --> 03:08:28.244]  So he talks for three, four hours in a meeting.
[03:08:28.284 --> 03:08:36.768]  They take a few clips out of context, but still, Dianne Feinstein rubbing her hands together like the Wicked Witch of Satan, you know, and agreeing.
[03:08:36.868 --> 03:08:38.669]  It's just, it's too much.
[03:08:39.069 --> 03:08:43.291]  Anthony Cumia, and we'll go back to Mr. Torban and get his take on what does Trump need to do.
[03:08:43.651 --> 03:08:44.612]  Internet Bill of Rights.
[03:08:46.673 --> 03:08:49.316]  Break up these companies, point out what's going on.
[03:08:49.617 --> 03:08:50.397]  What do we do?
[03:08:50.498 --> 03:08:57.866]  Bill, do platforms like compoundmedia.com, because he had the number one show on Terrestrial Radio for a while, banned it.
[03:08:59.241 --> 03:09:00.401]  Because it was kind of libertarian.
[03:09:00.421 --> 03:09:01.282]  It wasn't liberal or conservative.
[03:09:01.302 --> 03:09:03.103]  So they really fear something that unifies.
[03:09:03.183 --> 03:09:05.784]  And then that number one on XM and that made people jealous.
[03:09:05.804 --> 03:09:09.985]  So he's kicked off because he said these people killing cops and our people are savages.
[03:09:10.005 --> 03:09:10.966]  We don't care if they're white or black.
[03:09:10.986 --> 03:09:11.646]  They are savages.
[03:09:11.726 --> 03:09:12.626]  Shoot some random cop.
[03:09:13.067 --> 03:09:16.128]  That's why I'm glad, rising like the Phoenix, he has compound media.
[03:09:16.548 --> 03:09:21.350]  That became an incubation, you know, dish for all these other great hosts that go and then come back.
[03:09:21.890 --> 03:09:22.511]  It doesn't matter.
[03:09:22.951 --> 03:09:26.553]  It's that we're fighting and now the web itself they want to get rid of.
[03:09:26.593 --> 03:09:31.975]  The playing field, even though the cards are stacked, we have the will, we're still winning, so they want to shut him down.
[03:09:32.235 --> 03:09:39.518]  That's why it's great to have him hosting with us, letting us kind of have an emergency take over here because I'm a sexual assaulter, according to Newsweek.
[03:09:40.219 --> 03:09:42.460]  And I, um, what was the other thing?
[03:09:43.459 --> 03:09:48.503]  And I'm grooming men for gay sex because we're in a big editing suite and we're trying to light a guy for a bodybuilding shot.
[03:09:48.703 --> 03:09:49.864]  This is all admitted in HR.
[03:09:49.904 --> 03:09:50.284]  He said it.
[03:09:50.624 --> 03:09:54.627]  Yeah, it says how to light a bodybuilder and there's images of men in this editing bay.
[03:09:55.408 --> 03:09:55.908]  In Speedos.
[03:09:55.948 --> 03:09:58.350]  And we're like, uh, that's all in HR.
[03:09:58.830 --> 03:10:05.195]  But the point is, is that he says, I went in and saw gay porn and I think that's grooming for gay sex four years ago.
[03:10:06.434 --> 03:10:09.517]  And then, a girl hugs me, she says, which I didn't even do, by the way.
[03:10:10.057 --> 03:10:12.979]  I'm like Pence, I won't get on the elevator as a woman alone now.
[03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:14.701]  Seriously, I see one woman getting on, I don't do it.
[03:10:16.202 --> 03:10:19.765]  And then, that is sexually assaulting her.
[03:10:19.865 --> 03:10:25.049]  I mean, that may fly in the fake news media, that's not flying even in front of a Democrat jury.
[03:10:25.710 --> 03:10:30.854]  My lawyers are good, and they say, my God, we've never seen something this ridiculous.
[03:10:31.494 --> 03:10:33.176]  I mean, this is, but let me tell you something.
[03:10:33.616 --> 03:10:34.196]  It doesn't matter.
[03:10:34.256 --> 03:10:36.537]  People walk by and say, you lost your kids, even though I didn't.
[03:10:36.857 --> 03:10:41.238]  People walk by and say, you know, all this stuff because the left just takes talking points.
[03:10:41.598 --> 03:10:44.859]  They say that there's Mars bases, I reported on, that kids live on.
[03:10:44.879 --> 03:10:45.459]  I never said that.
[03:10:45.519 --> 03:10:46.160]  They just say it.
[03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:47.040]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:10:47.100 --> 03:10:47.780]  That's the zombies.
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:48.920]  Let me ask Anthony Cumia.
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:50.181]  We'll take over in a couple of segments.
[03:10:50.201 --> 03:10:51.721]  Appreciate you letting me board this operation.
[03:10:52.101 --> 03:10:54.422]  You know, I really appreciate you doing what you do at CompoundMedia.com.
[03:10:54.962 --> 03:10:56.983]  What in Hades is going on here?
[03:10:57.023 --> 03:10:58.323]  Because you know you're now on air.
[03:10:58.843 --> 03:11:04.313]  With a sexual assaulter because a girl says she hugged me and I patted a little far too down, Anthony.
[03:11:05.274 --> 03:11:06.577]  Alex, first of all...
[03:11:07.449 --> 03:11:08.910]  Damn, I love your show.
[03:11:09.170 --> 03:11:15.854]  I sit here before I get the honor of hosting that last hour, and I'm laughing my ass off.
[03:11:15.894 --> 03:11:16.755]  I'm entertained.
[03:11:16.835 --> 03:11:17.715]  I'm informed.
[03:11:18.156 --> 03:11:19.336]  It's fantastic.
[03:11:19.697 --> 03:11:20.657]  Thanks so much, man.
[03:11:22.018 --> 03:11:25.940]  You know, they have said things like this about me also.
[03:11:26.361 --> 03:11:27.421]  Sexual harassment.
[03:11:27.642 --> 03:11:34.446]  There's a great thing going around in some circles that I have sex with transsexuals.
[03:11:35.266 --> 03:11:37.687]  This is their tactic.
[03:11:37.927 --> 03:11:45.368]  They pull these things out and I think because they see how well it works with the left, with the degenerates in Hollywood.
[03:11:45.588 --> 03:12:01.091]  They actually see that people get prosecuted, they get thrown out of their businesses and go, well, let's just accuse the people we want out of existence and we want exiled to nowhere land and we'll say that they're as big a degenerate as we are.
[03:12:02.111 --> 03:12:05.614]  And that's exactly what they're doing with you, with me, and with a lot of people.
[03:12:05.754 --> 03:12:16.301]  When they cannot debate and argue a point because they have nothing, they turn to sexual harassment, you're this, you're a horrible father.
[03:12:16.321 --> 03:12:18.062]  We're wearing Nazi tennis shoes!
[03:12:19.820 --> 03:12:26.004]  And I guess his writers, that's what they are, fiction writers, they think if you say something really weird it must be true because it's so weird.
[03:12:26.324 --> 03:12:28.125]  Like, oh, let me put my Hitler shoes on.
[03:12:28.185 --> 03:12:29.706]  I mean, what the hell?
[03:12:30.766 --> 03:12:39.791]  From head to toe, there's Hitler shoes, the Hitler haircut, and everything in between just to peg you as, which I love, literally Hitler.
[03:12:40.131 --> 03:12:41.652]  Remember the Hitler teapot?
[03:12:42.052 --> 03:12:51.437]  It was a good looking teapot, JCPenney, but it had a black top, which is normal, but it did a shadow, and somebody might see Hitler, so they banned the teapot!
[03:12:52.958 --> 03:12:58.981]  It's getting to the point where I go to The Onion, which has been a funny satirical news site
[03:12:59.381 --> 03:12:59.881]  Is the racist?
[03:13:24.361 --> 03:13:30.928]  And kids love, like, they love horses, they love donkeys, they love chickens, they love pigs, they love gorillas, they love giraffes.
[03:13:31.349 --> 03:13:42.601]  I mean, I've got in my daughter's nursery, my 10-month-old daughter, we've got little paintings of Dr. Seuss, and we've got a Curious George painting, we've got a painting of a giraffe.
[03:13:42.841 --> 03:13:45.824]  Anthony, you just, oh my God, that's white supremacist.
[03:13:46.812 --> 03:13:54.055]  Yeah, I've never seen people that are more racist than the left.
[03:13:54.395 --> 03:13:55.876]  That's their whole gimmick.
[03:13:56.016 --> 03:14:03.819]  It's like saying Infowars is behind you and there's an O. Anthony Cumia put an image of someone's anus on TV subliminally.
[03:14:04.159 --> 03:14:05.159]  It's that delusional.
[03:14:05.179 --> 03:14:08.901]  Like, Anthony, why do you have an image of a man's... that's gay.
[03:14:09.581 --> 03:14:12.522]  Why are you... Anthony, why are you gramming me for gay sex?
[03:14:12.762 --> 03:14:14.423]  There's an anus clearly right there.
[03:14:15.183 --> 03:14:16.224]  No, I'm gonna sue you!
[03:14:16.664 --> 03:14:17.544]  I'm gonna sue you!
[03:14:17.985 --> 03:14:22.127]  Why did you put a man's rectum in front of me while you're trying to... Are you trying to have sex with me?
[03:14:23.327 --> 03:14:26.289]  The person that sees that has the problem!
[03:14:26.749 --> 03:14:29.551]  The person that actually came up with it is the lunatic!
[03:14:29.631 --> 03:14:30.011]  Exactly!
[03:14:30.031 --> 03:14:30.931]  What are those inkblots?
[03:14:30.951 --> 03:14:31.592]  What are those called?
[03:14:33.152 --> 03:14:34.133]  Oh, a Rorschach test.
[03:14:34.153 --> 03:14:34.673]  Rorschach!
[03:14:34.713 --> 03:14:35.594]  It's like crazy!
[03:14:36.354 --> 03:14:37.435]  Like, like, like, what do you see?
[03:14:37.455 --> 03:14:39.276]  Well, I see Infowars on the continents.
[03:14:39.576 --> 03:14:39.836]  No!
[03:14:40.216 --> 03:14:41.377]  You see a man's butt!
[03:14:44.122 --> 03:14:44.422]  Hey!
[03:14:44.783 --> 03:14:46.144]  There's a gorilla at the zoo!
[03:14:46.565 --> 03:14:48.366]  Oh my God, you're putting black people down!
[03:14:49.107 --> 03:14:50.829]  It's racially insensitive!
[03:14:52.350 --> 03:15:01.520]  And I'm so happy that those layers are being peeled off and they're being exposed for the mental patients that they are!
[03:15:02.870 --> 03:15:24.696]  I tell you though, they're teaching people that are like failures, or they'll even have jobs, and they just decide to go with this, and it ruins their lives, but they believe going SJW is like the way, and then they just walk around and say, we're going to come back and get solutions from Andrew Torba of Gab.ai, who they're trying to censor about what does Trump need to do, and I want to ask you that, then I'm going to punch out here and let you take over.
[03:15:25.096 --> 03:15:26.717]  Anthony Comey on fire as usual.
[03:15:27.537 --> 03:15:28.237]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:28.277 --> 03:15:29.738]  We've got 30 to 80% off.
[03:15:29.758 --> 03:15:30.298]  We've never had 80% off.
[03:15:31.701 --> 03:15:32.822]  A lot of these are lost leaders.
[03:15:33.542 --> 03:15:36.464]  Everything 80% is like stuff that we haven't sold.
[03:15:36.504 --> 03:15:38.205]  Great t-shirts, great books, great films.
[03:15:40.387 --> 03:15:41.528]  We're losing money on those.
[03:15:42.368 --> 03:15:45.851]  So you need to go make donations, buy the stuff at full price, but most of it's discounted.
[03:15:46.711 --> 03:15:51.434]  It's the Operation Paul Revere, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:51.835 --> 03:15:57.038]  Literally, don't let George Soros and Hillary Clinton's lawyer that's suing me for... Well, he didn't say it!
[03:15:58.019 --> 03:16:00.681]  The media takes it and says I sexually assaulted a woman!
[03:16:02.768 --> 03:16:13.160]  Info Wars, my radio program, our TV broadcast, our films, are among some of the biggest viral sensations in the last 20 years.
[03:16:13.861 --> 03:16:17.445]  And we're bringing back nationalism, we're bringing back sovereignty, we're bringing back
[03:16:18.126 --> 03:16:22.068]  True populism and rule for, of, and by the people.
[03:16:22.509 --> 03:16:36.697]  And that's why Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other mainstream media outlets, the modern robber barons of our age, admit, even in congressional hearings and in undercover videos, that the number one enemy to shut down is Infowars.
[03:16:37.177 --> 03:16:52.124]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live,
[03:16:53.124 --> 03:17:02.608]  The top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City of Terror, he was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:17:03.248 --> 03:17:10.591]  This is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:17:11.512 --> 03:17:18.935]  How quickly can you act and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[03:17:19.676 --> 03:17:23.280]  That's something we're thinking about all the time, because it's a bad user experience.
[03:17:23.581 --> 03:17:24.682]  The system self-corrected.
[03:17:24.802 --> 03:17:27.646]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:17:27.666 --> 03:17:29.889]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:17:31.091 --> 03:17:31.892]  But you saw this?
[03:17:32.112 --> 03:17:32.833]  USA Today.
[03:17:33.254 --> 03:17:34.355]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:17:34.516 --> 03:17:36.098]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:17:37.239 --> 03:17:46.005]  At the very least, we can say that this shelf of videos from news programs is legitimate news, because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[03:17:46.825 --> 03:17:51.869]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well...
[03:17:52.609 --> 03:17:54.471]  They were looking for him, speaking with anyone.
[03:17:54.831 --> 03:18:00.777]  So they shadow ban our videos, they block our articles, they ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[03:18:01.258 --> 03:18:05.602]  That's why it's so essential that you continue to stand in the face of their censorship.
[03:18:05.822 --> 03:18:08.425]  Because if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[03:18:09.025 --> 03:18:12.887]  But because of their brazenness, it's caused the Streisand effect.
[03:18:13.667 --> 03:18:21.311]  And they're now panicking because their attempts to censor us have only made the message expand and get out in ways it never would have.
[03:18:21.972 --> 03:18:23.713]  So I know a lot of you are smarter than I am.
[03:18:23.753 --> 03:18:25.634]  You've got great inventive ways to take action.
[03:18:26.114 --> 03:18:35.499]  But however you do it, spreading articles, spreading videos, on your own email list, telling friends and family about the censored information in person, however you do it, calling in to C-SPAN,
[03:18:37.032 --> 03:18:43.564]  Getting on other shows online, letting them know that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that if we can be censored successfully...
[03:18:44.742 --> 03:18:46.263]  All of you can be censored as well.
[03:18:46.744 --> 03:18:50.366]  So be sure and like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[03:18:50.667 --> 03:18:52.588]  Be sure to send out the videos, the articles.
[03:18:53.609 --> 03:18:56.611]  Be sure to report on anything we've covered that you think is important.
[03:18:56.811 --> 03:18:59.914]  Feel free to re-upload our videos and post them wherever you like.
[03:19:00.054 --> 03:19:01.695]  All of it is copyright free.
[03:19:02.195 --> 03:19:03.696]  Be sure and click the notifications.
[03:19:04.337 --> 03:19:09.461]  Be sure and subscribe to all of our great channels because we're in a real fight.
[03:19:09.781 --> 03:19:09.961]  I think?
[03:19:29.975 --> 03:19:32.016]  It's evil, and together we're gonna defeat it.
[03:19:32.397 --> 03:19:44.904]  So folks, you have absolutely been the resistance, you have cut through all their propaganda, and because of that I salute you, and I ask you now, more than ever, to redouble your efforts, because if you're watching this transmission and listening, you are the resistance.
[03:19:56.271 --> 03:19:58.152]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:08.817]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:29.494]  All right, Andrew Torbak.
[03:20:29.994 --> 03:20:31.816]  That's right.
[03:20:32.417 --> 03:20:40.547]  Rising up, ought to play this whole song, because we're almost into the final stanza here where I totally win, as everybody knows.
[03:20:41.909 --> 03:20:44.532]  Another cheesy line from, what is it, Pat Benatar?
[03:20:44.952 --> 03:20:46.034]  The invincible winner?
[03:20:47.930 --> 03:20:49.652]  We can all smell it, we all know it.
[03:20:50.253 --> 03:20:51.355]  All of you are winners as well.
[03:21:03.991 --> 03:21:07.335]  You know, the Anthony Comey Show was like number one in the morning all over the country.
[03:21:07.355 --> 03:21:09.799]  They got so mad at it, he made a fart joke.
[03:21:09.819 --> 03:21:10.580]  They banned him.
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:15.386]  They put him on XM, became number one, kicked him off there because he wasn't a communist.
[03:21:15.406 --> 03:21:16.307]  He wasn't an SJW.
[03:21:16.347 --> 03:21:17.048]  He's a libertarian.
[03:21:17.388 --> 03:21:18.830]  So let me ask you both this question.
[03:21:19.676 --> 03:21:22.957]  Going back to Andrew Torba of Gab, what does the president need to do?
[03:21:22.977 --> 03:21:24.498]  Because I know we can get him messages.
[03:21:24.518 --> 03:21:26.119]  I mean, we got people in the White House.
[03:21:26.519 --> 03:21:27.259]  He is listening.
[03:21:27.299 --> 03:21:35.622]  Like you said, his new guy who was the head of his internet operation, Brad Pascal, you're saying he is more red-pilled than gets.
[03:21:35.662 --> 03:21:36.362]  This is the whole fight.
[03:21:36.402 --> 03:21:37.663]  It's already happening for 2018, 2020.
[03:21:38.103 --> 03:21:40.824]  So we kind of got a twin problem now.
[03:21:40.844 --> 03:21:44.065]  What do you make of the Second Amendment comments versus also the internet?
[03:21:44.125 --> 03:21:45.166]  What does the president need to do?
[03:21:47.336 --> 03:21:50.517]  Sure, so I think he needs to take immediate and swift action.
[03:21:50.657 --> 03:21:52.278]  He needs to take this seriously.
[03:21:52.298 --> 03:21:57.079]  And we all, as his supporters, need to take this seriously as well.
[03:21:57.419 --> 03:22:13.124]  When you think about it, Alex, we're up against unlimited resources, both human and capital, total and complete control of the internet, total and complete control of the media, total and complete control of our culture and entertainment, and yet the elite fear us, and they do everything in their power to silence us.
[03:22:13.584 --> 03:22:13.864]  Why?
[03:22:14.265 --> 03:22:18.749]  Well, it's because what we have is more powerful than all of those things combined.
[03:22:19.169 --> 03:22:24.554]  It's ideas, it's passion, it's grit, it's authentic community, it's a sense of urgency.
[03:22:25.555 --> 03:22:30.279]  These are the things that empower us against the globalists and against the elites to get
[03:22:30.299 --> 03:22:30.839]  Thank you.
[03:22:48.504 --> 03:22:54.429]  I agree, and it was the great French philosopher that said that no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[03:22:55.190 --> 03:23:02.196]  If you look at Brad Parscale, I was pronouncing it wrong, I'm teleprompter free, if he gets that, it's great.
[03:23:02.236 --> 03:23:05.018]  But this is not a 2020 issue.
[03:23:05.639 --> 03:23:07.100]  This is happening right now.
[03:23:07.741 --> 03:23:10.863]  And so, I mean, I agree, we need to do something now.
[03:23:11.664 --> 03:23:15.367]  They're moving against us because they know they're trying to dominate us, and I want to be online.
[03:23:15.547 --> 03:23:17.388]  That's more than 80% of the battle.
[03:23:17.428 --> 03:23:19.050]  But we should all do more demonstrations.
[03:23:19.570 --> 03:23:21.311]  We should shoot more things outside.
[03:23:21.371 --> 03:23:22.452]  We should talk to more people.
[03:23:22.752 --> 03:23:23.913]  We should get more people involved.
[03:23:23.953 --> 03:23:32.700]  The answer is more people speaking out with whatever their information is, whatever their worldview is, whatever their truth is from their perspective, and not cookie-cutter.
[03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:33.921]  That's what's going to win.
[03:23:34.441 --> 03:23:35.062]  Anthony Cummings.
[03:23:36.334 --> 03:23:49.026]  Yeah, when you see people demonstrating on the left, like we saw last week where those kids are demonstrating against the Second Amendment, and they're out there, do you see people trying to silence them?
[03:23:49.367 --> 03:23:52.510]  Do you see protesters inciting violence against them?
[03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:53.631]  They're able to get up there,
[03:23:53.951 --> 03:23:54.412]  It's bullying!
[03:24:10.572 --> 03:24:10.752]  I agree.
[03:24:27.009 --> 03:24:29.030]  So where does it go, Anthony Comey, if we give in?
[03:24:29.070 --> 03:24:34.733]  We know in every case in history, if we give in to this, I want to ask Mr. Torber that as well, where does it end if we give in?
[03:24:34.773 --> 03:24:35.553]  We know where it ends.
[03:24:35.593 --> 03:24:36.293]  It's a domino.
[03:24:36.333 --> 03:24:37.734]  We've got to hold the line.
[03:24:37.774 --> 03:24:38.314]  This is it.
[03:24:38.534 --> 03:24:41.436]  If you don't want to be Venezuela or North Korea, folks, this is it.
[03:24:44.017 --> 03:24:44.257]  Anthony?
[03:24:45.055 --> 03:24:45.736]  Absolutely.
[03:24:46.056 --> 03:24:58.704]  Well, you know, people like Andrew that are really gearing up and firing up a different platform for us, because Twitter is ridiculous.
[03:24:59.004 --> 03:25:04.668]  I don't know who's delusional enough to think this isn't an agenda-driven platform.
[03:25:04.908 --> 03:25:11.493]  You have people like Sarah Silverman, who is just, apparently, people thought she was funny years ago.
[03:25:11.813 --> 03:25:12.573]  She's up there now.
[03:25:12.814 --> 03:25:14.655]  She could say whatever she wants,
[03:25:15.035 --> 03:25:18.878]  In whatever language she wants against somebody that she disagrees with.
[03:25:19.258 --> 03:25:26.483]  The second you turn and criticize her using the same language she used, mind you, you're thrown off of the platform.
[03:25:27.083 --> 03:25:27.884]  It is so biased.
[03:25:28.024 --> 03:25:29.845]  And by the way, bringing that up to you and then Torba.
[03:25:31.515 --> 03:25:32.896]  It's famous with Roger Stone.
[03:25:33.436 --> 03:25:38.560]  He was criticizing people that were saying he's a piece of crap, he's a communist, he needs to die.
[03:25:38.861 --> 03:25:43.705]  He just said you're a screwball, screw you to Oberman and one other lady.
[03:25:44.025 --> 03:25:51.211]  He got banned and his lawyers even met with him and they admitted, well, we're a leftist group, we're a minority group, so we're allowed to say those mean things.
[03:25:51.251 --> 03:25:52.472]  You're a white male, you're not.
[03:25:52.812 --> 03:25:54.373]  I was talking to a lawyer today.
[03:25:55.254 --> 03:25:55.775]  High level.
[03:25:56.355 --> 03:26:03.102]  And he was talking about this other case, and he said, well, they're claiming they're heterosexual, and you discriminate against that.
[03:26:03.422 --> 03:26:05.744]  That's impossible, because that's a dominant group.
[03:26:06.065 --> 03:26:09.628]  And I was disagreeing with this high-level lawyer, even though their claim's BS.
[03:26:09.668 --> 03:26:15.514]  I was going, what, a heterosexual can't have a... I mean, man, this is like cuckoo land.
[03:26:17.742 --> 03:26:28.344]  We've entered an amazing world, a bizarro world, where you can't criticize or critique a movie because of the subject matter, like we saw with Black Panther.
[03:26:29.124 --> 03:26:44.447]  There's been zero media as far as what's going on with white farmers having their land taken away in South Africa because they are looked at as privileged and as people that are incapable of being
[03:26:45.187 --> 03:26:54.090]  And by the way, they live in cobra-infested, lion-infested areas and produce 70% of the food.
[03:26:54.510 --> 03:26:57.131]  Only 40,000 farms and half are closing up.
[03:26:57.471 --> 03:27:01.272]  And South Africa, watch, in three years, South Africa will be starving.
[03:27:01.592 --> 03:27:03.713]  We will have all the leftist sending food there.
[03:27:05.029 --> 03:27:07.330]  But everybody right now is looking like, good!
[03:27:07.690 --> 03:27:09.390]  They're getting what they deserve!
[03:27:09.430 --> 03:27:16.852]  And this is amazing because, you know, they're the privileged class and they're being oppressed right now.
[03:27:17.032 --> 03:27:19.113]  Doesn't matter what color you are, race, religion.
[03:27:19.433 --> 03:27:22.334]  If you're being oppressed, you're being oppressed.
[03:27:22.374 --> 03:27:22.754]  That's it.
[03:27:23.134 --> 03:27:25.935]  And these people are not, you're not going to hear about this.
[03:27:26.135 --> 03:27:28.257]  Anthony Cumia taking over on the other side.
[03:27:28.457 --> 03:27:32.300]  We're down, what, six hours into the global transmission that's going to continue.
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:33.581]  Emergency free speech transmission.
[03:27:33.801 --> 03:27:34.822]  We had this set up for weeks.
[03:27:34.882 --> 03:27:37.224]  I had no idea that we'd be under total attack when it actually happened.
[03:27:37.524 --> 03:27:39.386]  We're finishing with Andrew Torber.
[03:27:39.406 --> 03:27:41.707]  Thanks for riding the shotgun and co-hosting Gab.ai.
[03:27:42.568 --> 03:27:43.369]  Closing comments, sir.
[03:27:45.342 --> 03:27:51.545]  Yeah, Alex, I think where this ends up is they want us dead or in jail, to be very blunt.
[03:27:52.105 --> 03:27:58.048]  This is a global information war, and if we don't stand up and fight back, they're going to win.
[03:27:58.428 --> 03:28:04.451]  We need to stand up for our freedom of expression, for our individual liberty, for the free flow of information.
[03:28:04.851 --> 03:28:09.874]  These are the things that made this country great, and that is how we're going to make the country great again.
[03:28:10.314 --> 03:28:17.736]  So, I think that, you know, what we need to do is continue to build new platforms, continue to support new platforms like Gab and like others.
[03:28:18.256 --> 03:28:20.496]  We can't put all of our eggs in one basket.
[03:28:20.856 --> 03:28:23.277]  Why are we continuing to support... No, I agree.
[03:28:23.497 --> 03:28:27.497]  Everyone who has a Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube account should go to gab.io right now.
[03:28:27.918 --> 03:28:32.498]  They should all get a profile, all be there, and then use Facebook to push to Gab.
[03:28:32.518 --> 03:28:33.759]  I've been saying this for years.
[03:28:34.139 --> 03:28:39.880]  And everybody should go to compoundmedia.com and sign up there and pick a show you want to subscribe to because this is...
[03:28:40.060 --> 03:28:40.520]  We are!
[03:28:41.141 --> 03:28:43.463]  And I'm telling you, it's not about millions of damn money.
[03:28:43.523 --> 03:28:45.385]  I got a family ranch in the whole nine yards.
[03:28:45.706 --> 03:28:46.887]  I've spent my own money on this.
[03:28:47.367 --> 03:28:51.371]  I'm doing this because we got a bunch of globalists who are assholes, excuse me, to delete that quickly.
[03:28:52.132 --> 03:28:53.713]  They're allowed to cuss on everywhere else, but I can't.
[03:28:53.733 --> 03:28:57.057]  I tell you, they are a bunch of effing you-know-whats, but I'm going to stop right there.
[03:28:57.077 --> 03:28:57.697]  We're going to come back.
[03:28:58.058 --> 03:28:59.839]  Anthony Comey is taking over straight ahead.
[03:29:00.380 --> 03:29:01.321]  It's up to you, America.
[03:29:06.254 --> 03:29:07.674]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[03:29:07.714 --> 03:29:09.175]  Victor, you're calling.
[03:29:09.235 --> 03:29:09.575]  Go ahead.
[03:29:09.695 --> 03:29:09.975]  Yes.
[03:29:10.415 --> 03:29:11.135]  Hi, Alex.
[03:29:11.235 --> 03:29:17.436]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[03:29:17.636 --> 03:29:21.617]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[03:29:21.857 --> 03:29:23.297]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[03:29:23.677 --> 03:29:30.378]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[03:29:30.438 --> 03:29:33.299]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[03:29:34.199 --> 03:29:38.900]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[03:29:38.940 --> 03:29:46.761]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[03:29:46.781 --> 03:29:52.582]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[03:29:52.722 --> 03:29:58.043]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[03:29:58.123 --> 03:30:01.124]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[03:30:03.635 --> 03:30:08.538]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:31:20.366 --> 03:31:21.627]  I think it's beyond seasonal.

[03:32:59.540 --> 03:33:00.821]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:24.566 --> 03:33:31.229]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.489 --> 03:33:34.130]  And Anthony Cummings is riding a shotgun.
[03:33:34.370 --> 03:33:41.133]  You know, I grew up, I grew up not liking hype, not liking people bragging about stuff.
[03:33:42.233 --> 03:33:47.095]  So when we get up here and we tell you this is the epic fight for free speech, the draconian internet takeover is here.
[03:33:48.584 --> 03:33:52.468]  The solid war against the Second Amendment, everything, it is on.
[03:33:52.488 --> 03:33:58.535]  It was almost like a death rattle or kind of a death battle, kind of like you've gotten stabbed and you kind of fight back hard for a minute.
[03:33:58.875 --> 03:34:00.997]  That's what I see Trump as, is like a breath of air.
[03:34:01.398 --> 03:34:02.759]  You ever been caught in a rip current?
[03:34:02.779 --> 03:34:04.681]  I've been caught in a really bad one, but one time I got caught in...
[03:34:05.749 --> 03:34:10.952]  About 800 yards down the Texas coast and hit a river, a stream coming out and that kind of ended it.
[03:34:10.972 --> 03:34:13.614]  So I was able to get up and I knew not to fight it or I'd have died.
[03:34:13.634 --> 03:34:16.036]  But I remember it had been a big storm.
[03:34:16.256 --> 03:34:17.096]  Water was flowing out.
[03:34:17.157 --> 03:34:17.797]  Shouldn't have been swimming.
[03:34:17.837 --> 03:34:18.437]  I was like 12.
[03:34:18.758 --> 03:34:24.201]  Got sucked under, but I was already a really great swimmer and I relaxed, came back up, didn't panic.
[03:34:25.042 --> 03:34:28.524]  Got sucked under a little bit more, but only got stuck there for like 10 seconds, but you can panic doing that.
[03:34:28.884 --> 03:34:31.286]  Pop back up, another five seconds, got over.
[03:34:32.619 --> 03:34:32.919]  I think so.
[03:34:52.619 --> 03:34:55.301]  They're all over the news saying Deplatform must ban us from the Internet.
[03:34:56.041 --> 03:34:58.483]  When you ban us from the Internet, it sets the precedent.
[03:34:58.563 --> 03:35:07.289]  And three weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal said News Corp, that's Fox, met with the big Democrats and Google and Facebook and decided
[03:35:08.268 --> 03:35:08.768]  I don't know.
[03:35:23.661 --> 03:35:26.823]  Because they keep showing the dictators that he's already a dictator of the Communist Party.
[03:35:27.083 --> 03:35:27.963]  They're making him permanent.
[03:35:28.583 --> 03:35:30.944]  And then Trump, take guns first, go through the process.
[03:35:30.984 --> 03:35:34.046]  And I give him an open talk like, because they go, sir, it's due process.
[03:35:34.286 --> 03:35:35.486]  The guy already had due process.
[03:35:35.867 --> 03:35:36.827]  He was going to kill people.
[03:35:36.867 --> 03:35:37.527]  He was mentally ill.
[03:35:37.547 --> 03:35:37.988]  He was on drugs.
[03:35:38.008 --> 03:35:38.988]  The guns should have already been taken.
[03:35:39.228 --> 03:35:39.989]  They stood down.
[03:35:40.329 --> 03:35:44.451]  Trump's like, well, if due process got messed up, he says he's going to kill people, take it.
[03:35:44.531 --> 03:35:46.411]  I get in an emergency situation.
[03:35:46.932 --> 03:35:48.232]  Somebody says I'm going to kill people.
[03:35:48.612 --> 03:35:49.233]  There's no judge.
[03:35:49.253 --> 03:35:49.973]  There's no jury.
[03:35:50.153 --> 03:35:50.793]  Witness says it.
[03:35:50.853 --> 03:35:51.454]  Cops grab you.
[03:35:52.074 --> 03:35:58.296]  Trump just is in there talking for hours, and he says, oh yeah, do this, and hey, put in the bill what you want, let's work something out.
[03:35:58.336 --> 03:35:59.317]  He did that on DACA.
[03:36:00.457 --> 03:36:05.259]  And they brought an unreasonable thing back, it fell apart.
[03:36:05.399 --> 03:36:06.519]  That's what he's doing, I think.
[03:36:06.579 --> 03:36:11.301]  But still, you want to drive your base away, Trump, I think, is making a big mistake.
[03:36:11.361 --> 03:36:13.322]  People are going crazy.
[03:36:13.402 --> 03:36:16.243]  Anthony Cumia of compoundmedia.com, what do you think about this?
[03:36:17.168 --> 03:36:18.149]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:36:18.549 --> 03:36:22.033]  I was tweeting about this last night, and unfortunately, yes, tweeting.
[03:36:22.713 --> 03:36:29.860]  I wish I could get to everybody through a place like Gab, but until we really get a lot of people on Gab... No, we've got to be on both.
[03:36:29.880 --> 03:36:30.801]  We've got to be on all of them.
[03:36:30.861 --> 03:36:34.905]  You've still got to be on both, but like you said, drive them toward the alternative.
[03:36:35.705 --> 03:36:43.791]  Uh, to Twitter, but I was on there last night talking about this and a lot of people worry that Donald Trump is, uh, going against what he said about the Second Amendment during his campaign.
[03:36:44.211 --> 03:36:46.672]  And I said, have you read Art of the Deal?
[03:36:46.692 --> 03:36:47.293]  The Art of the Deal.
[03:36:47.673 --> 03:36:49.254]  This is how he bargains.
[03:36:49.514 --> 03:36:50.615]  Now, I agree with you 100%.
[03:36:51.656 --> 03:36:59.401]  It's a very risky move to alienate that base that put you in office, but we all have to remember he's done this before.
[03:36:59.761 --> 03:37:00.862]  This is how he does it.
[03:37:01.102 --> 03:37:02.883]  He becomes a sympathetic
[03:37:03.624 --> 03:37:05.587]  A person to the opposition.
[03:37:05.828 --> 03:37:08.312]  They're like, oh look, he wants to work with us.
[03:37:08.332 --> 03:37:11.458]  It's formulaic and I can't believe Feinstein and them don't get it.
[03:37:12.372 --> 03:37:20.775]  They believe, the left, the Democrats, and unfortunately a lot of his supporters, believe what he's saying and take it at face value.
[03:37:21.135 --> 03:37:23.056]  This is how he negotiates.
[03:37:23.336 --> 03:37:32.119]  He gives them what they want, and then when they pour ten times more on top, and it gets shot down, he goes, well I tried to make the kids safe.
[03:37:32.319 --> 03:37:34.060]  And he says that, exactly.
[03:37:34.120 --> 03:37:36.241]  He knows it's, I know he's doing that.
[03:37:36.661 --> 03:37:39.543]  So how do I respond to my listeners that are ready to tear my head off when I say that?
[03:37:39.703 --> 03:37:41.025]  Because I'm never going to steer people wrong.
[03:37:41.345 --> 03:37:44.487]  I may be wrong, but I'm telling you really what I believe.
[03:37:44.527 --> 03:37:45.788]  And Anthony, I agree with you.
[03:37:46.109 --> 03:37:47.410]  This is what he does over and over.
[03:37:47.450 --> 03:37:48.270]  Did we get DACA?
[03:37:48.991 --> 03:37:49.231]  No.
[03:37:49.711 --> 03:37:50.952]  Are they trying to kill him?
[03:37:50.972 --> 03:37:51.953]  Yeah, they know.
[03:37:57.017 --> 03:38:02.299]  He was talking about letting twice as many people in, or to stay, than they wanted.
[03:38:02.719 --> 03:38:04.119]  And everybody lost their minds.
[03:38:04.279 --> 03:38:04.639]  What?!
[03:38:05.140 --> 03:38:13.242]  You ran on a campaign of building the wall... Because he tricked them to be arrogant and say, no borders, world government, F you, you're a Nazi.
[03:38:13.582 --> 03:38:14.762]  Like, everybody's legalized!
[03:38:14.942 --> 03:38:15.623]  F you, Nazi!
[03:38:15.663 --> 03:38:16.343]  He tricked them!
[03:38:17.313 --> 03:38:17.813]  Exactly.
[03:38:18.394 --> 03:38:26.598]  Based on his, and this isn't just like, you said this before, it's not just being, oh he's a Trump head, he just backs Trump at every turn.
[03:38:26.878 --> 03:38:30.520]  No, I'm basing it off of what I've already seen him do.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:32.581]  This is how he operates.
[03:38:32.821 --> 03:38:35.202]  It's an amazing negotiation tool.
[03:38:35.222 --> 03:38:36.523]  He's playing him like a Stradivarius.
[03:38:37.774 --> 03:38:38.314]  Absolutely.
[03:38:38.574 --> 03:38:40.975]  And if it turns out to be wrong, he'll pay for it.
[03:38:41.015 --> 03:38:43.096]  But it is a risky move.
[03:38:43.336 --> 03:38:46.097]  But in this situation, nothing's going to be easy.
[03:38:46.297 --> 03:38:49.598]  You have the media and the left and the entertainment industry.
[03:38:49.738 --> 03:38:50.018]  I agree.
[03:38:50.058 --> 03:38:51.518]  It is a master move.
[03:38:54.079 --> 03:38:58.141]  Yeah, you have all those people and organizations against you.
[03:38:58.401 --> 03:39:03.503]  You have to take some risky moves to win in these situations.
[03:39:03.563 --> 03:39:04.363]  It's called a gambit.
[03:39:04.423 --> 03:39:06.424]  It's called a pawn.
[03:39:06.564 --> 03:39:09.625]  He knows Feinstein Bill is a total assault weapons, all semi-autos man.
[03:39:10.105 --> 03:39:11.946]  So he goes, I'm not saying you're going to get it.
[03:39:11.966 --> 03:39:14.267]  Let's get the clip ready of her laughing.
[03:39:14.487 --> 03:39:16.388]  I'm not saying you're going to get it, but you put it in.
[03:39:17.307 --> 03:39:18.828]  And then the Republicans are all shaking their heads.
[03:39:18.868 --> 03:39:19.868]  They've got the majority.
[03:39:19.888 --> 03:39:21.469]  It isn't going to happen that way.
[03:39:22.110 --> 03:39:24.331]  It's so clear what he's doing because I read Art of the Deal.
[03:39:25.071 --> 03:39:26.212]  I had read it like two years ago.
[03:39:26.252 --> 03:39:27.413]  I finally thought, this guy's about to win.
[03:39:27.453 --> 03:39:28.133]  I better read this book.
[03:39:28.193 --> 03:39:31.475]  And now you see Trump is following a total formula.
[03:39:32.782 --> 03:39:40.868]  Yeah, it's how he operates, and the Republicans sat there stone-faced because they're politicians.
[03:39:41.228 --> 03:39:43.089]  They never operated like this.
[03:39:43.329 --> 03:39:50.994]  He's a businessman who's negotiated and made deals his entire career, and that's what he's doing right now, right in front of your face!
[03:39:51.135 --> 03:39:54.397]  And let's be clear, they go, oh, he's only worth $10 billion, others are worth $100 billion.
[03:39:54.417 --> 03:39:56.518]  He didn't do it through some combine or some global group.
[03:39:56.538 --> 03:39:58.119]  He did it always as his own.
[03:39:58.139 --> 03:39:58.880]  That's why they fear him.
[03:39:59.300 --> 03:40:01.782]  Do we have that clip of Feinstein looking like a witch, like, when he says it?
[03:40:04.769 --> 03:40:10.491]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:40:10.551 --> 03:40:13.952]  If you could add that to this bill, that would be great, Diane.
[03:40:13.992 --> 03:40:17.893]  If you could add what you have also, and I think you can, into the bill.
[03:40:18.674 --> 03:40:19.634]  Joe, are you ready?
[03:40:19.654 --> 03:40:20.334]  Can you do that?
[03:40:20.994 --> 03:40:22.015]  Joe, can you do that?
[03:40:22.415 --> 03:40:24.135]  Can you add some of the things?
[03:40:24.155 --> 03:40:25.176]  You're not going to agree with me?
[03:40:25.196 --> 03:40:26.076]  Is this the Wizard of Oz?
[03:40:26.954 --> 03:40:30.256]  Well, no, I'll help, but can you add what Amy and what Diane have?
[03:40:30.297 --> 03:40:31.117]  Can we add them in?
[03:40:31.337 --> 03:40:32.698]  And I know you can add what John has.
[03:40:32.738 --> 03:40:39.784]  I have another domestic violence bill that's very narrow, and it's about dating partners, and a number of states have just enacted it.
[03:40:39.864 --> 03:40:41.645]  Oh, yes, their dating partner kissed you.
[03:40:41.685 --> 03:40:42.466]  You can take his guns.
[03:40:42.966 --> 03:40:49.991]  If you can add domestic violence paragraphs, pages, into this bill, I'm all for it.
[03:40:52.113 --> 03:40:52.813]  He's not all for it.
[03:40:52.833 --> 03:40:53.314]  Pass it in.
[03:40:53.334 --> 03:40:53.954]  He's all for it.
[03:40:54.014 --> 03:40:54.315]  Go ahead.
[03:40:55.086 --> 03:40:56.967]  Yeah, listen to his language right there.
[03:40:57.147 --> 03:40:58.988]  Add it in, I'm all for it.
[03:40:59.268 --> 03:41:01.429]  Now, he's all for gun control.
[03:41:01.629 --> 03:41:03.730]  He's all for, no, he's all for adding it in.
[03:41:04.110 --> 03:41:05.231]  Just add it in, go ahead.
[03:41:05.251 --> 03:41:07.132]  And notice he says, it may not pass.
[03:41:08.012 --> 03:41:11.214]  It's total taking the piss out of him.
[03:41:12.214 --> 03:41:17.116]  He knows politicians are the greediest people you'll ever encounter.
[03:41:17.636 --> 03:41:21.857]  So you tell them you're winning, they'll tell you who they really are.
[03:41:22.878 --> 03:41:29.860]  Yes, and they'll pile more things on any bill and it will lose and he looks like the good guy.
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:32.101]  It's so obvious and it's
[03:41:32.381 --> 03:41:35.442]  And he's done it before and he's not let us down yet.
[03:41:35.582 --> 03:41:37.142]  Like he's told me personally, I will not let you down.
[03:41:37.582 --> 03:41:39.883]  But did you see Feinstein still doesn't get it?
[03:41:40.383 --> 03:41:48.165]  She can't even get the nomination of her own party.
[03:41:50.746 --> 03:41:52.086]  Yes, my pretty!
[03:41:52.486 --> 03:41:54.887]  You will get all the legislation!
[03:41:55.747 --> 03:41:58.148]  I'll get you and your little dog too!
[03:41:58.668 --> 03:42:00.709]  You know, Hershey's gonna be starring in the new Wizard of Oz.
[03:42:00.729 --> 03:42:01.449]  They're actually remaking it.
[03:42:03.521 --> 03:42:05.263]  It's ridiculous.
[03:42:05.303 --> 03:42:16.461]  Look, I'm nervous because it is a big risk and I don't want people that are disillusioned because he's working this tactic to get too nervous and back away from supporting him.
[03:42:17.731 --> 03:42:18.752]  This is what he does.
[03:42:18.852 --> 03:42:20.054]  Have faith in the guy.
[03:42:21.596 --> 03:42:24.078]  During the campaign and during his presidency.
[03:42:24.098 --> 03:42:25.440]  He hasn't let us down yet.
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:26.641]  He hasn't let us down yet.
[03:42:26.661 --> 03:42:29.204]  Let me tell you.
[03:42:29.725 --> 03:42:30.666]  He's not infallible.
[03:42:30.886 --> 03:42:31.627]  Way better than Hillary.
[03:42:31.647 --> 03:42:32.348]  We're going to see what happens.
[03:42:32.368 --> 03:42:32.948]  We're going to come back.
[03:42:33.269 --> 03:42:34.910]  Andy, I've been taken over here, which you don't mind.
[03:42:34.930 --> 03:42:35.371]  I love it, Alex.
[03:42:35.431 --> 03:42:37.934]  What else are you going to hit when we come back?
[03:42:38.777 --> 03:42:45.539]  I want to hit about the technology that's coming in, and we're putting surveillance in our own homes, and they're going to big corporations.
[03:42:46.179 --> 03:42:46.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:42:46.900 --> 03:42:54.422]  The NSA and the issue, it's Apple and Google and all these other pieces of crap, who are already, like, kissing communist Chinese.
[03:42:54.442 --> 03:42:58.163]  I mean, if you want to know how authoritarian the left is, they love communist China.
[03:42:58.643 --> 03:43:00.744]  It kills Buddhists, Christians, you name it, for no reason.
[03:43:00.764 --> 03:43:01.304]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:04.997 --> 03:43:09.760]  Now, joining us is a best-selling author and researcher, Michael Malice.
[03:43:10.661 --> 03:43:11.662]  MichaelMalice.com.
[03:43:11.702 --> 03:43:15.325]  He grew up behind the Iron Curtain, so he understands the tyranny of collectivism.
[03:43:15.345 --> 03:43:16.906]  He's at Twitter, at Michael Malice.
[03:43:16.986 --> 03:43:21.549]  He's written Dear Reader, Kim Jong-il, and he's been over there and researched it.
[03:43:21.569 --> 03:43:25.672]  So again, Michael Malice, author of The Dear Reader, about North Korea.
[03:43:26.272 --> 03:43:29.695]  Give us your expert take on where we are right now and the chances for war over there.
[03:43:30.095 --> 03:43:31.615]  I talk about this heavily in my book.
[03:43:31.755 --> 03:43:35.236]  If you look at these countries, Libya is a great example.
[03:43:35.696 --> 03:43:37.836]  Iraq, and several others.
[03:43:37.996 --> 03:43:43.317]  When the countries liberalized, Romania was the example Kim Jong Il himself used.
[03:43:43.337 --> 03:43:47.178]  When these countries liberalize, very often the people at the top are shot.
[03:43:47.698 --> 03:43:48.558]  And with good reason.
[03:43:48.618 --> 03:43:50.719]  You look at Gaddafi, he was sodomized to death.
[03:43:51.019 --> 03:43:52.299]  Saddam Hussein was hung.
[03:43:52.659 --> 03:43:55.459]  And Libya had a nascent nuclear program.
[03:43:55.819 --> 03:43:57.080]  They agreed to give it up.
[03:43:57.140 --> 03:43:59.260]  And what happened is, right now you have slavery there.
[03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:04.083]  So North Korea very quickly realizes the best defense is a good offense.
[03:44:04.643 --> 03:44:10.967]  Kim Jong-il said he wants to turn the country into a hedgehog, meaning one with nuclear missile spines pointing in every direction.
[03:44:11.387 --> 03:44:13.509]  And if you think about it, how much easier?
[03:44:13.709 --> 03:44:19.392]  I don't think they would have been running their mouths to this point if they didn't have nukes or at least some very, very strong weaponry.
[03:44:19.713 --> 03:44:20.853]  Something would have happened to him.
[03:44:20.973 --> 03:44:24.015]  So they are very conniving in their hold on power.
[03:44:24.335 --> 03:44:24.896]  They're very
[03:44:25.476 --> 03:44:35.882]  Uh, interested in self-preservation, and unfortunately it's at the expense of the, you know, 25 million North Korean population who are the victims in this horrible decades-long atrocity.
[03:44:36.362 --> 03:44:45.967]  Don't they know the calculus has changed and that the whole strategy of patience and then the globalists using North Korea as a strategy of tension, that that is coming to an end?
[03:44:46.167 --> 03:44:48.308]  It is coming to an end, and they're scared.
[03:44:48.408 --> 03:44:52.490]  And they're clearly scared, and you see that they're reaching out to South Korea, their arch-rival.
[03:44:52.510 --> 03:44:58.693]  It's some kind of... China very publicly last year, and in recent months, has been turning their backs on them.
[03:44:59.033 --> 03:45:01.234]  Russia, to some extent, has been turning their backs on them.
[03:45:01.454 --> 03:45:06.757]  You know, Putin liked the idea that North Korea could kind of be a thorn in our side, but even he's not going to be defending.
[03:45:07.037 --> 03:45:07.177]  Yeah.
[03:45:27.848 --> 03:45:31.411]  Every country is turning their back on the North, and they don't know what to do.
[03:45:31.471 --> 03:45:33.292]  This is kind of uncharted territory for them.
[03:45:33.592 --> 03:45:34.092]  Thank God.
[03:45:34.132 --> 03:45:41.097]  And I'm not saying this is the end of the North Korean regime, which I pray every day that it is, but if this were the end, this is what the end would look like.
[03:45:41.337 --> 03:45:49.903]  They are a hostage nation of just people who don't even know what planet they're on, and that's why they're the greatest victims, people under communism.
[03:45:49.943 --> 03:45:52.525]  Michael Malice, the book Dear Reader, available everywhere.
[03:45:52.545 --> 03:45:54.106]  Twitter, Michael Malice.
[03:45:54.346 --> 03:45:55.487]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:45:55.527 --> 03:45:56.167]  I appreciate you.
[03:45:56.828 --> 03:45:57.368]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:46:04.216 --> 03:46:22.507]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:46:22.607 --> 03:46:28.031]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:46:28.891 --> 03:46:29.572]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:46:30.012 --> 03:46:32.854]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[03:46:33.494 --> 03:46:34.455]  And so much more.
[03:46:35.035 --> 03:46:36.156]  It is concentrated.
[03:46:36.376 --> 03:46:38.098]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:46:38.118 --> 03:46:43.802]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:46:43.922 --> 03:46:45.123]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:46:45.143 --> 03:46:47.065]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:46:47.145 --> 03:46:49.547]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:46:49.747 --> 03:46:51.008]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:46:51.188 --> 03:46:52.990]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:54.150]  Immune Wall.
[03:46:54.251 --> 03:46:55.572]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:55.692 --> 03:46:56.873]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:47:06.713 --> 03:47:09.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.714 --> 03:47:15.396]  Good old George Strait.
[03:47:15.456 --> 03:47:17.957]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[03:47:18.457 --> 03:47:19.297]  If you leave me,
[03:47:33.207 --> 03:47:34.288]  I won't miss you.
[03:47:34.368 --> 03:47:36.809]  By the way, George Strait's a listener, but he won't come on.
[03:47:39.271 --> 03:47:40.692]  I don't blame him.
[03:47:40.812 --> 03:47:42.553]  What an amazing guy from Central Texas.
[03:47:42.633 --> 03:47:46.556]  Remember one time I got invited to this birthday party for another musician.
[03:47:47.679 --> 03:47:48.079]  They go.
[03:47:48.740 --> 03:47:50.100]  Yeah, he said, the hole's playing tonight.
[03:47:50.140 --> 03:47:50.901]  You ought to hang out.
[03:47:50.941 --> 03:47:51.861]  George might make it.
[03:47:51.882 --> 03:47:53.482]  It was in between San Antonio and Austin.
[03:47:53.522 --> 03:47:55.924]  I said, after about four hours, I said, I'm going to go.
[03:47:56.344 --> 03:47:59.526]  Ten minutes after I pulled out of there, George Strait pulled up and played for an hour.
[03:48:00.106 --> 03:48:03.408]  In a little honky-tonk out on, you know, some little road in Texas.
[03:48:03.829 --> 03:48:04.449]  That's cool.
[03:48:05.049 --> 03:48:07.030]  That was a Jimmy Vaughn party or something.
[03:48:07.531 --> 03:48:08.391]  I'm not name-dropping.
[03:48:08.952 --> 03:48:10.653]  That's the really cool stuff right there.
[03:48:11.293 --> 03:48:13.334]  But Anthony Comey is here just briefly.
[03:48:14.435 --> 03:48:15.195]  I'm not bitching.
[03:48:15.235 --> 03:48:16.016]  I'm not complaining.
[03:48:16.954 --> 03:48:18.716]  But I asked for this.
[03:48:18.856 --> 03:48:20.557]  They're trying to shut us down everywhere.
[03:48:21.038 --> 03:48:28.204]  They're saying in Newsweek I assaulted a woman sexually when the EEOC complaint says she hugged me and my hand went down too low and that's not even true.
[03:48:29.005 --> 03:48:30.667]  Sexual assault is not a woman hugging you.
[03:48:31.748 --> 03:48:39.395]  They say me looking at pictures of bodybuilders for lighting an ad for a video we shot right in the studio is grooming somebody for gay sex.
[03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:42.990]  Newsweek doesn't show that.
[03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:46.111]  They just say, Jones groomed people for gay sex.
[03:48:46.231 --> 03:48:48.491]  Well, nothing against gay sex, but I ain't doing it.
[03:48:49.112 --> 03:48:53.432]  So, Anthony Comey is riding a shotgun here, normally on show.
[03:48:54.013 --> 03:48:58.313]  All I'm saying is we got 30 to 80% off all products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:48:59.214 --> 03:49:01.094]  And a lot of those are lost leaders.
[03:49:01.654 --> 03:49:03.254]  We've got a donate page, I never promote it.
[03:49:03.715 --> 03:49:05.775]  Infowars.com forward slash show now has it.
[03:49:06.195 --> 03:49:07.175]  Infowars.com.
[03:49:07.195 --> 03:49:10.156]  You can also go to Infowarsstore.com, there is a
[03:49:11.136 --> 03:49:31.913]  Link there on the side for support us Right up there on the corner and if you click on that then the bottom link is a donation Straight-up donations are great because then you know we sell some bottle of supplements for 30 bucks It's costing us, you know 15 because we don't put crap in these that's not a lot of money with and look I'm not bitching, but it's a war.
[03:49:31.973 --> 03:49:32.453]  It's a fight.
[03:49:32.793 --> 03:49:34.014]  You want to fight you want to win?
[03:49:34.054 --> 03:49:34.455]  This is it
[03:49:34.975 --> 03:49:38.138]  We need people to go to InfoWarsTore.com and buy the products.
[03:49:38.318 --> 03:49:42.801]  And to sign up for AutoShip, get an additional 10% off, even on stuff 80% off.
[03:49:43.282 --> 03:49:44.443]  Then it's a major loss.
[03:49:44.463 --> 03:49:45.824]  We're losing 30-40% at that.
[03:49:46.484 --> 03:49:48.726]  We need you to support those local AM and FM affiliates.
[03:49:48.746 --> 03:49:53.310]  We need you to, you know, support everything because this is the fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:54.831]  This is the real deal.
[03:49:55.272 --> 03:49:57.233]  And we've got Owen Schroer coming up from the War Room.
[03:49:57.253 --> 03:50:00.516]  I'm going to be back tonight, right through tomorrow with David Knight and a bunch of special guests.
[03:50:00.856 --> 03:50:04.919]  Well, we got Gerald Cilente, we got Paul Watson, we've got all these folks.
[03:50:05.019 --> 03:50:09.982]  This is the fight for people that just want to have a free market level playing field and aren't bullies.
[03:50:10.322 --> 03:50:21.870]  Even though CNN wants to be banned off Google, YouTube, my listeners are like, well, let's file complaints on CNN, you know, when they're bullying some woman at her house in Florida since she's a Russian-Asian for no reason.
[03:50:22.511 --> 03:50:24.192]  Here's the deal, they're not going to do it anyways.
[03:50:24.252 --> 03:50:25.573]  Plus, we just don't do that.
[03:50:25.953 --> 03:50:28.015]  We just adapt, we improvise, we overcome.
[03:50:29.355 --> 03:50:30.215]  I don't know.
[03:50:50.282 --> 03:50:56.204]  But I want to tell you, I never, and it's not that I'm an arrogant man, it's not that I'm a proud man, it's just that I want to do things myself.
[03:50:56.244 --> 03:50:58.045]  I've never taken a loan for this operation.
[03:50:59.165 --> 03:51:04.067]  I'm the type of guy that always, since even in high school, I bought my first used car when I was 16 with my own money.
[03:51:04.687 --> 03:51:05.947]  Then later my dad bought me a new truck.
[03:51:05.967 --> 03:51:08.608]  He's like, I got you a piece of crap for your new truck.
[03:51:08.928 --> 03:51:10.369]  But I love that car I bought myself.
[03:51:11.109 --> 03:51:13.350]  I built all this because of your support, because of you.
[03:51:13.390 --> 03:51:14.971]  You built Infowars, you are Infowars.
[03:51:15.371 --> 03:51:18.652]  But I'm going to get on the phone today and I'm going to call
[03:51:19.662 --> 03:51:28.266]  Some of the folks that have offered a lot of money, and I'm going to just say, because I never, there's no strings attached anyways, but I'm going to say, listen, this is about all of us.
[03:51:28.346 --> 03:51:29.147]  I need a lot of money.
[03:51:29.747 --> 03:51:32.829]  And by the way, I don't just need that half a million or that 50,000 you offered.
[03:51:32.869 --> 03:51:33.269]  I need you to.
[03:51:34.144 --> 03:51:38.088]  I need you to understand, unless you want to evacuate the U.S., I need everything you can give us.
[03:51:38.528 --> 03:51:40.690]  You can come and see what we're doing with the money.
[03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:41.972]  I want to get aggressive.
[03:51:42.692 --> 03:51:44.894]  I can do some Project Veritas stuff nobody's seen.
[03:51:44.955 --> 03:51:47.857]  I can break them with what they did with this Hillary lawyer.
[03:51:48.278 --> 03:51:49.899]  But I need major firepower.
[03:51:49.919 --> 03:51:54.083]  And I got an army of licensed former military people.
[03:51:54.924 --> 03:51:59.909]  Ready, as private investigators and others and our other forces who are ready to go.
[03:52:00.049 --> 03:52:04.293]  But they'll do it for free, just like the groups we've got busting pedophile rigs right now.
[03:52:04.613 --> 03:52:07.136]  They've just got to have the funding for the basic operations.
[03:52:07.176 --> 03:52:12.040]  And we busted over 30 pedophiles killing children that were being held as slaves.
[03:52:12.341 --> 03:52:13.522]  That's going to come out very, very soon.
[03:52:13.582 --> 03:52:16.685]  I funded a group working with law enforcement just for the basic funding.
[03:52:16.725 --> 03:52:17.325]  That's going to come out.
[03:52:17.626 --> 03:52:18.546]  That's why they're pissed at me.
[03:52:19.207 --> 03:52:20.608]  That's what it's all about.
[03:52:41.986 --> 03:52:43.607]  And I never thought I'd be in this position.
[03:52:44.028 --> 03:52:51.433]  That's why I'm kindred spirit with Anthony Comey, who's been censored and attacked because he wouldn't be anti-American when he had the number one show on XM, the number one show on Terrestrial.
[03:52:51.893 --> 03:52:54.915]  That's why he's a rock star to me, because he didn't sell out.
[03:52:55.035 --> 03:52:59.278]  And everybody else, Milo, I don't agree with all this politics, but he got destroyed because he wouldn't sell out.
[03:52:59.779 --> 03:53:00.799]  Those are my heroes.
[03:53:00.859 --> 03:53:03.681]  So let's go to my hero, Anthony Comey, for the last four minutes.
[03:53:03.721 --> 03:53:04.282]  Thank you, Anthony.
[03:53:05.410 --> 03:53:06.190]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:53:06.451 --> 03:53:07.031]  Unbelievable.
[03:53:08.052 --> 03:53:08.632]  It's happening.
[03:53:09.452 --> 03:53:10.793]  It's right out there in the open, too.
[03:53:10.833 --> 03:53:16.356]  This isn't some covert thing that the left is trying to pull.
[03:53:16.737 --> 03:53:18.037]  It's right there in the open.
[03:53:18.398 --> 03:53:23.781]  People are absolutely being censored, and they are trying to eliminate
[03:53:24.381 --> 03:53:30.226]  People from having a voice and we see it every day And we don't Alex is right.
[03:53:30.246 --> 03:53:32.549]  We don't play by those those tactics.
[03:53:33.089 --> 03:53:48.463]  We don't try to shut them down I feel the more they actually talk The more rope you're getting back up to come on the show and they won't do all the time all the time and they just will not come on because they never have anything they are they have the ability to call you and
[03:53:49.123 --> 03:54:01.894]  Every type of ist or phobe, they have the ability to make false allegations about sexuality and domestic violence, but they will not come on and actually argue a point.
[03:54:02.134 --> 03:54:04.857]  As far as the gun issue goes, I have never in my life
[03:54:05.137 --> 03:54:11.122]  I've never seen a group of people so ignorant about the actual thing they are trying to take away.
[03:54:11.802 --> 03:54:18.808]  The laws, the rights, the mechanics of a gun, the laws to get certain weapons in this country.
[03:54:19.088 --> 03:54:25.073]  I've never seen a group of people completely ignorant about what they're trying to keep from people.
[03:54:26.737 --> 03:54:29.898]  And that's, but that's the left.
[03:54:30.038 --> 03:54:31.199]  They'll call you a gun nut.
[03:54:31.659 --> 03:54:34.480]  They'll call you, you have the blood of children on your hands.
[03:54:35.080 --> 03:54:41.122]  Like all that stuff, instead of just having a logical, reasonable debate back and forth.
[03:54:41.402 --> 03:54:48.045]  I can't get a volley on social media to go past two exchanges before it turns into... They don't have enough honour.
[03:54:48.085 --> 03:54:52.166]  An honourable man or woman wants to be real and debate because they're followers.
[03:54:52.566 --> 03:55:02.359]  And this society has been so good, the West has been so rich, it's created a bunch of beta followers who want to then just shut down debate so they can claim they get the trophy but never won it.
[03:55:04.088 --> 03:55:06.969]  That's what we were saying years ago.
[03:55:07.249 --> 03:55:10.669]  The first articles we read that said, can you believe this?
[03:55:10.709 --> 03:55:12.529]  They're giving kids participation trophies.
[03:55:12.709 --> 03:55:13.330]  Can you believe this?
[03:55:13.350 --> 03:55:18.130]  They're not keeping score in the sports in schools anymore because some people get hurt.
[03:55:18.250 --> 03:55:19.751]  They're not having Valentine's Day.
[03:55:20.271 --> 03:55:25.672]  You can't have a father-daughter dance anymore because some people don't.
[03:55:25.812 --> 03:55:28.692]  Disappointment is part of life.
[03:55:29.652 --> 03:55:33.113]  Hey, the times I've had my ass handed to me is when I became a man.
[03:55:35.066 --> 03:55:35.606]  That's it!
[03:55:35.666 --> 03:55:36.827]  You have to know what it's like.
[03:55:37.087 --> 03:55:41.870]  Valentine's Day as a kid, when some kids are getting cards and other kids aren't.
[03:55:42.190 --> 03:55:44.411]  That's part of what you'll experience in life.
[03:55:44.631 --> 03:55:49.034]  You're supposed to learn about how to deal with people in a society.
[03:55:49.214 --> 03:55:50.315]  Exactly.
[03:55:50.415 --> 03:55:51.095]  What's the song?
[03:55:51.115 --> 03:55:53.056]  You've got to know how to lose.
[03:55:53.577 --> 03:55:54.957]  It's that Aerosmith song from the late 70s.
[03:55:55.137 --> 03:55:57.359]  You've got to know how to lose and know how to win.
[03:55:58.410 --> 03:56:00.991]  Yeah, and that's absolutely true.
[03:56:01.571 --> 03:56:10.753]  And you're taking that away from kids who at this point have no idea of how to face-to-face actually talk to someone anyway because of social media.
[03:56:11.093 --> 03:56:22.115]  So you're taking away, when they are in school and they are together in a group, you're taking away all types of education that they would get on how to deal with people.
[03:56:22.295 --> 03:56:28.599]  You're teaching them, as long as you're in a leftist, globalist cult, and follow that, we'll let you spread your news and feel important.
[03:56:28.619 --> 03:56:29.340]  But you're a slave.
[03:56:29.380 --> 03:56:29.980]  It's not real.
[03:56:30.320 --> 03:56:32.462]  Anthony Cumea, compoundmedia.com.
[03:56:32.522 --> 03:56:32.922]  Amazing.
[03:56:33.202 --> 03:56:34.723]  I want to get you on as a guest on Air Fuse.
[03:56:34.743 --> 03:56:36.204]  You're not just on the fourth hour.
[03:56:36.224 --> 03:56:37.125]  I appreciate you.
[03:56:37.205 --> 03:56:39.387]  Great lineup of hosts at compoundmedia.com.
[03:56:39.407 --> 03:56:40.507]  Everybody should go there and check it out.
[03:56:40.527 --> 03:56:41.508]  Everybody should donate.
[03:56:41.568 --> 03:56:43.109]  Infoworkstore.com or buy the products.
[03:56:43.129 --> 03:56:45.010]  That does it as well, but they're so discounted.
[03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:46.772]  We need to flood our operation with money.
[03:56:47.572 --> 03:56:49.233]  Or we're going to be destroyed and be defeated.
[03:56:49.273 --> 03:56:50.393]  It's up to you if you're going to save us.
[03:56:50.673 --> 03:56:51.513]  Help us, listeners.
[03:56:51.533 --> 03:56:52.193]  You're our only hope.
[03:56:52.213 --> 03:56:53.614]  Princess Leia begs Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[03:56:53.874 --> 03:56:54.854]  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[03:56:54.874 --> 03:56:55.814]  General Kenobi, you're our only hope.
[03:56:55.854 --> 03:56:56.375]  You're our only hope.
[03:56:56.395 --> 03:56:57.095]  And I know you'll come through.
[03:56:57.115 --> 03:56:57.775]  I love you.
[03:56:57.795 --> 03:56:58.955]  It's the Animated Contest of Liberty.
[03:56:58.995 --> 03:56:59.635]  War Room coming up.
[03:56:59.856 --> 03:57:03.617]  Let's go out to break with Dio's rendition of Dream On.
[03:57:03.637 --> 03:57:04.017]  Here it is.
[03:57:04.037 --> 03:57:07.738]  Thank you, Anthony.
[03:57:07.858 --> 03:57:11.819]  If you are receiving transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:57:13.274 --> 03:57:20.698]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:57:20.738 --> 03:57:22.439]  The past is gone.
[03:57:22.459 --> 03:57:25.661]  I don't look at the part where he explains.
[03:57:26.161 --> 03:57:29.903]  To know how to win, you gotta lose.
[03:57:42.268 --> 03:57:45.311]  Dust to dawn, isn't that the way?
[03:57:45.331 --> 03:57:48.374]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[03:57:54.375 --> 03:57:58.816]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:59.036 --> 03:58:03.737]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:58:04.357 --> 03:58:10.178]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:58:10.718 --> 03:58:23.200]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:23.960 --> 03:58:32.646]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:58:32.666 --> 03:58:34.568]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:58:34.888 --> 03:58:36.089]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:58:36.269 --> 03:58:38.691]  Doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink anything.
[03:58:39.071 --> 03:58:40.392]  Man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:58:40.892 --> 03:58:42.492]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:58:42.512 --> 03:58:44.313]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:58:44.653 --> 03:58:47.254]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:58:47.294 --> 03:58:48.154]  This is insane.
[03:58:48.574 --> 03:58:50.195]  I said, yeah, you look ten years younger.
[03:58:50.435 --> 03:58:52.996]  He said, oh yeah, it's just I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:58:53.436 --> 03:58:56.817]  He says, this is totally free, but he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:58:56.837 --> 03:58:59.798]  And I said, it's the synergy of it, of the
