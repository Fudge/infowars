[00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:17.129]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.449]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:41.953]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:45.019]  Tuesday, the 20th day of March 2018.
[00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:52.023]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we have an unusual overload of critical news and information.
[00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:54.864]  First off, out of the gates.
[00:00:54.864 --> 00:01:07.591]  One of the live feed names that we sent out over the internet today on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter has the headline in it, Learn Exclusively Why Facebook Stock Has Dropped Nearly $40 Billion.
[00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:11.613]  And it's not because of the one company
[00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:25.142]  Over in the UK that's involved in hundreds of elections a year with its analytics and scraping names to attach them to email lists for the different parties.
[00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:35.765]  It's because by the mainstream media finally reporting on what Facebook does, it then brings down the whole house of cards.
[00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:40.047]  So they were so desperate to try to act like Trump stole the election that they
[00:01:42.017 --> 00:01:54.769]  Gave away the farm by admitting that Facebook is a giant data mining operation and sells your information.
[00:01:54.769 --> 00:02:01.274]  And now the former head of Hillary's campaign has come out and said, oh yeah, we own Facebook of the Democratic Party.
[00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:02.656]  What did I say yesterday?
[00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:06.039]  I said Facebook is a Democratic Party globalist weapon system.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:27.251]  What the British company did, who by the way get hired by leftists, conservatives, you name it, and there is a lot of evidence of corruption going on there, that's what these companies do, that Bannon came and culled five million names off of billions on Facebook so they could email him.
[00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:32.675]  Now I said that Sunday when it broke, I said that yesterday, Snowden's come out and said that,
[00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.955]  Hillary's former manager has come out and said that, because I'm not a tech guy, but I read the tech publications.
[00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:47.177]  And this is what these companies do.
[00:02:47.177 --> 00:03:02.846]  And this particular company over in the UK is small in the overall business, but the media thought, the control court thought that they could dynamite Trump and make it look like Trump had committed all these crimes.
[00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:09.309]  But then once people go, wait a minute, Facebook was involved.
[00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.333]  Oh, wait a minute, Facebook does it on a scale billions of times bigger because they're doing it every day.
[00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:28.485]  How Trump consultants exploited the Facebook data of millions, millions, New York Times, Cambridge Analytica response after CEO filmed discussing bribery and entrapment of politicians around the world.
[00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:31.933]  They're just mercenaries.
[00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:40.462]  Authorities seek warrant to raid offices of Cambridge Analytica amid Facebook data showdown.
[00:03:40.462 --> 00:03:42.023]  This is what big data does.
[00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:43.365]  You think Facebook's bad?
[00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:48.269]  Alphabet and Google make Facebook look tame.
[00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.831]  Like a freshman.
[00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.833]  And Google has a master's degree.
[00:03:53.775 --> 00:04:01.298]  So, the left thought it could limit it, limit just showing you the Big Brother control grid, but only a small little snapshot.
[00:04:01.298 --> 00:04:07.060]  I mean, like, we're at a 30,000 foot view, and we're seeing all the different globalists and operations and thousands of companies.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.402]  They zoomed in with a microscope down and went, look, this is the entire universe.
[00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:15.444]  The entire universe is nothing but Cambridge Analytica.
[00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:16.724]  They invented this.
[00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:18.225]  They are the reason.
[00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:22.567]  It's like saying the big bad Russians can steal all the elections when there's all these other people and players.
[00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:29.828]  It's like saying one high school team is the only football team in the world.
[00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:36.912]  Now you pull back and there's thousands of high school teams, there's hundreds of college teams, there's dozens of NFL teams.
[00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:38.974]  They just focus in there with deception.
[00:04:38.974 --> 00:04:43.876]  So you're looking right at the fine print and you pull back and it's like, whoa!
[00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:46.178]  And it's that pullback that's devastating Facebook.
[00:04:46.858 --> 00:05:00.667]  As everybody learns what we told you a decade ago, it's there to control dumb effers, run your life, scam you, manipulate you, sell your data and social engineer you and make you depressed until you commit suicide.
[00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:06.931]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.796]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.796 --> 00:06:14.177]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.177 --> 00:06:16.278]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:18.038]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:19.179]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:24.421]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:32.400]  Well, we've got another big, important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:41.026]  Facebook has seen its stock go down $40 billion because the cat's out of the bag.
[00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:49.912]  The Democrats saw one little thread on the Christmas sweater and they reached out and grabbed it and began pulling back.
[00:06:49.912 --> 00:06:54.435]  And pretty soon, the whole sweater was in a big pile of yarn.
[00:06:56.613 --> 00:07:04.787]  Because Facebook, Amazon, Google, YouTube, Twitter, they're all giant snooping systems.
[00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:19.308]  They're all giant psychological warfare systems to create false realities and then to control you and to use bots to manipulate your political, cultural, and economic views to consolidate power and wealth.
[00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:21.789]  They are looting operations.
[00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:32.311]  And the fact that the media, the controlled corporate media, the London Guardian, tried to act like Trump stole the election because one company, Cambridge Analytica,
[00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:40.498]  Was legally allowed by Facebook to go in and data mine.
[00:07:40.498 --> 00:07:48.966]  They thought they bought what 200 something thousand and they said they got into five million using that they leveraged it out to 50 million people they reach for the campaign.
[00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:53.310]  Well if you look at the reach in fact we don't ask Lewis to give you a screenshot or or John.
[00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:59.744]  We, Facebook says we reach billions of people a quarter.
[00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:02.650]  Now that just means they get on a screen and see our information.
[00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.535]  Doesn't mean they read it, doesn't mean they watch the video, but it means...
[00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:13.075]  Billions of people just on our Facebook platforms see InfoWars material every quarter.
[00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:15.717]  I mean, last time I saw it was a couple billion a quarter.
[00:08:15.717 --> 00:08:21.180]  So when you hear numbers like 50 million reach, that is nothing.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.261]  And I'm not defending Steve Bannon.
[00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:29.565]  I'm not even defending that back when he was at Breitbart, that he was trying to get a mailing list of people to come to Breitbart.
[00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:31.206]  That's what you should do.
[00:08:31.206 --> 00:08:32.166]  But I'm not even defending him.
[00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:33.607]  I don't like Steve Bannon.
[00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:34.728]  I'm defending reality.
[00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:56.909]  And so as soon as they began to look at how Facebook let this company in to do that, they're trying to say this one company with Facebook was the person that basically destroyed the virginity of the pure driven snow that is Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:08:56.909 --> 00:08:57.710]  No.
[00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.152]  Facebook is a giant gang raping operation.
[00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:05.764]  And thousands of companies can go in and buy whatever data they want.
[00:09:05.764 --> 00:09:08.646]  Law enforcement, private companies, private investors.
[00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:14.010]  There are hundreds of companies in Austin, Texas that mine Facebook.
[00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.152]  Where I sit.
[00:09:16.152 --> 00:09:17.473]  By the way, a new bombing today.
[00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:24.098]  A fifth bombing blew up at a FedEx facility in San Antonio, an hour south of where I sit.
[00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:27.521]  And it was another shrapnel bomb on its way to Austin, so the police said
[00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:34.585]  That it was a bomb that was being constructed right there on the site.
[00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:44.369]  I've confirmed from another law enforcement source that exactly what we were told, the individual at least with the first bombs was using a mousetrap.
[00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:51.192]  So that when it flips, it then powers the little capacitor and then detonates the bomb.
[00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:55.954]  That's what they call a tripwire in the woods or these other things is a pressure release bomb, a mousetrap.
[00:09:57.233 --> 00:10:01.677]  And then now I guess they've changed tactics again or it's more than one individual.
[00:10:01.677 --> 00:10:06.301]  Paul Watson makes the point that the Unabomber is being glorified on Netflix.
[00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:08.323]  The left unifies the Unabomber.
[00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:09.684]  I said that last week.
[00:10:09.684 --> 00:10:13.527]  I said that Theodore Kaczynski is like a poster child for the left.
[00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:16.349]  It's kind of worshipped by the left.
[00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:20.693]  And it's kind of a prototype of the Antifa in many respects.
[00:10:20.693 --> 00:10:21.714]  And so I said that could be it.
[00:10:21.714 --> 00:10:23.315]  Also the bombing looks like a circle.
[00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:29.301]  I was talking to some law enforcement sources this morning and they said that maybe they're just putting a circle around Austin.
[00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:39.998]  Or maybe it is kind of Fight Club-esque, where they're going to make a smiley face, or that was fiction, but somebody tried to recreate that a few years later, blowing up mailboxes.
[00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:44.202]  Or perhaps it is a Zodiac Killer type deal, where there's going to be some codes in this.
[00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:52.749]  Because these loons tend to like to feel powerful, to feel important, and have a code, then, that everyone looks at.
[00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:54.891]  A lot of times it's kind of an occultic ritual.
[00:10:57.162 --> 00:11:00.823]  They believe enough people look at it or see it that it becomes powerful.
[00:11:00.823 --> 00:11:01.963]  It gives them power.
[00:11:01.963 --> 00:11:07.825]  It's like the maniac that poisoned the treaty oak that was in central Austin.
[00:11:07.825 --> 00:11:13.286]  Big giant oak tree where they signed the treaty basically creating Texas.
[00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:22.029]  And he was a devil worshiper and at night he dug into it with a jackhammer and poured hundreds of pounds of weed killer.
[00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.262]  On the tree.
[00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:26.222]  So, there's never any telling.
[00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:28.263]  I mean, the person's crazy.
[00:11:28.263 --> 00:11:30.144]  Or the group is out of their minds.
[00:11:30.144 --> 00:11:34.286]  But, there's a lot of permutations in that.
[00:11:34.286 --> 00:11:38.387]  But you are getting the exclusive information that it is a pressure bomb.
[00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:40.308]  Individuals using mousetraps.
[00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:42.569]  That when you pick it up, it flips the mousetrap.
[00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:46.631]  Then that flips the switch that detonates the bomb.
[00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:49.192]  And from this law enforcement source, it's a separate one from the other two.
[00:11:50.854 --> 00:11:55.456]  More of a bomb expert, I'll just say that.
[00:11:55.456 --> 00:11:57.257]  They don't understand.
[00:11:57.257 --> 00:12:07.261]  They're saying it's primitive, they're saying it's dangerous, but it's not because they're attaching the wire after the mousetrap is set.
[00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:12.544]  It's still dangerous, but not like a mercury switch.
[00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:17.846]  It's a big, big, giant, crazy, dystopic soap opera and we're all living right in the middle of it.
[00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:30.487]  So pray for folks, pray for everybody, and you never know, randomly, this is the type of lottery you don't want to win, where you go out to get that package, and it blows your arms off.
[00:12:30.487 --> 00:12:43.293]  I was talking to one source, and they talked about the poor 17-year-old man who was the second person to be bombed, and it blew his arms off, almost blew his head off, because it blew up right in a V-shaped doorway.
[00:12:43.293 --> 00:12:46.295]  So he got the full force, but he felt no pain.
[00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:52.978]  Blew his arms off, blew a big hole in his chest and almost blew his head off his shoulders.
[00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:54.479]  So that's what's going on there.
[00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:57.741]  Figures go out to the family and those folks.
[00:12:57.741 --> 00:13:03.124]  I got a bunch of other, it's so much news today, but let me get back to the whole Zuckerberg thing.
[00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:13.166]  This company, Cambridge Analytica, has hundreds of clients.
[00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.887]  And the new news is that now there's attention on them.
[00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:20.449]  There is Channel 4 report with undercover video of Alexander Nix.
[00:13:21.732 --> 00:13:40.942]  Well, that sounds like a James Bond supervillain, Alexander Nix, telling undercover reporters posing as prospective Sri Lankan clients, because they'll do Republican, Democrat, they don't care, liberal, conservative, communist, whatever, that his company could potentially entrap politicians by setting them up with attractive women and filming the encounter, and that they're mainly just former MI6 spies.
[00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:42.603]  Well, that's it!
[00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:53.108]  You graduate out of these, out of the military, and then out of college, or vice versa, and then into the CIA or other agencies, and then into the private operations.
[00:13:53.108 --> 00:13:57.130]  I keep explaining this to everybody, and they're just mercenary groups.
[00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.611]  That's all.
[00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:08.616]  And that's why 80% of the Russian bots were pro-Hillary, because it was just three different companies we now know of that just took money.
[00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:16.582]  And in elections, you get around the Federal Elections Commission if you're corrupt by going to foreign companies to do it.
[00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:19.264]  So, of course, there was Russian-based collusion.
[00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:21.505]  Very, very small, less than half percent.
[00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:25.168]  Even the congressional reports had met of overall bot activity.
[00:14:25.168 --> 00:14:27.009]  But it was some effective botting.
[00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:32.993]  Michael Moore out at anti-Trump rallies during the election, after the election, from the Russian bots.
[00:14:32.993 --> 00:14:34.995]  Because it was an effective company.
[00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:36.456]  And you pay them money, they'll go do it.
[00:14:37.483 --> 00:14:38.924]  I don't do that type of advertising.
[00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:41.006]  A lot of it's legal, but I still don't go there.
[00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.027]  You can go pay companies to bot your stuff everywhere.
[00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:49.272]  You can go pay companies to push your... You can go buy fake Twitter followers and Facebook likes and all of that.
[00:14:49.272 --> 00:14:50.133]  Everybody knows about that.
[00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:53.996]  But they're trying to act like only Trump and only Bannon did this.
[00:14:53.996 --> 00:15:00.981]  And they're trying to conflate it with other stuff this company did with, you know, something that Trump supposedly did when Trump did nothing.
[00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:02.182]  And I'm not defending Trump.
[00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:03.223]  I'm defending reality.
[00:15:04.383 --> 00:15:13.589]  And that's why Facebook stocks down right at $40 million today because they're going, wait, you're going to get this company in trouble for going and data mining millions of people out of here?
[00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:16.591]  When Facebook is a giant data mining operation and sells it to everybody?
[00:15:16.591 --> 00:15:19.634]  I can go to Facebook and buy data.
[00:15:19.634 --> 00:15:23.917]  You can go to, let me tell you, money talks and you know what locks?
[00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:26.218]  You can't touch my three lock box.
[00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.280]  So we're going to continue to watch that as it unfolds.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.803]  But it just shows how the left is so savage, so mindless, so out of control.
[00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:36.162]  Trying to get Trump.
[00:15:36.162 --> 00:15:41.423]  There's a reason other bigger, smarter organizations didn't use this data to try to hurt Trump before.
[00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:51.847]  Because they know it leads right back to them, and now the head of the Clinton campaign admitting, we're going to cover that when we come back, they're saying, hey, we quote, own.
[00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:52.547]  We own.
[00:15:53.837 --> 00:15:54.797]  Facebook.
[00:15:54.797 --> 00:15:56.678]  The Democratic Party owns it.
[00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:59.719]  Yeah, and they're mad that Bannon tried to scratch the surface.
[00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.680]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.582]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:16.925]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:22.627]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:16:22.807 --> 00:16:23.287]  We're good to go.

[00:16:59.124 --> 00:17:01.686]  Hey, this is Ricky from Banyan Hill.
[00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:02.847]  You like freedom?
[00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:03.588]  I do.
[00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:04.588]  You like money?
[00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:05.089]  I do too.
[00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:09.492]  If you like freedom and money, then you're going to love Freedom Checks.
[00:17:09.492 --> 00:17:16.158]  You see, over the next few months, an estimated $34.6 billion is up for grabs to anyone who stakes their claim.
[00:17:16.778 --> 00:17:17.798]  Yep, you heard that right.
[00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:19.299]  $34.6 billion.
[00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:26.061]  To get all the details, just go to www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.641]  Thousands of people are already lined up to cash in.
[00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:30.002]  Take Doug, for example.
[00:17:30.002 --> 00:17:34.023]  He's a 46-year-old from Joplin, Missouri who's set to get a check for $24,075.
[00:17:34.023 --> 00:17:37.944]  If Doug can do this, I've got a hunch that you can too.
[00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:39.745]  But here's the thing.
[00:17:39.745 --> 00:17:48.009]  If you want the chance to grab your full fair share of this $34.6 billion payout, you must have your ducks in a row by April 1st.
[00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:49.030]  So don't wait.
[00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:54.313]  Get over to www.americanfreedomchecks.com before the April 1st deadline.
[00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:57.655]  That's www.americanfreedomchecks.com.
[00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:09.346]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.346 --> 00:18:17.752]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.752 --> 00:18:22.635]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:29.040]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:36.567]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:43.613]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.613 --> 00:18:48.097]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:48.097 --> 00:18:51.300]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:19:05.285]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:15.469]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:19.111]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks
[00:19:19.611 --> 00:19:19.871]  Absolutely.
[00:19:42.065 --> 00:20:02.813]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:05.514]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:24.845]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:47.671 --> 00:20:57.122]  So, think about how stupid the London Guardian is to put out a big story claiming that a guy with pink hair invented data mining.
[00:20:57.122 --> 00:21:00.265]  Well, that's what the NSA is.
[00:21:00.265 --> 00:21:05.151]  And that he invented going into Facebook and pulling names.
[00:21:05.151 --> 00:21:07.814]  Something that's been happening since the day Facebook began.
[00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:13.290]  And I'm going to get into a news article about that, documenting it in a moment.
[00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.013]  Obama's former campaign director makes bombshell claim.
[00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:18.857]  Facebook was on our side.
[00:21:18.857 --> 00:21:21.941]  Goes on to say that we own them.
[00:21:23.266 --> 00:21:24.087]  On our side.
[00:21:24.087 --> 00:21:24.587]  Own them.
[00:21:24.587 --> 00:21:26.148]  That's the truth!
[00:21:26.148 --> 00:21:27.669]  Anybody been on Facebook knows that.
[00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:29.550]  They block your pro-America stuff.
[00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.151]  They force-feed you Hillary stuff.
[00:21:31.151 --> 00:21:32.792]  I mean, that's a fact.
[00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:37.716]  Facebook, YouTube, all of them put globalist propaganda in front of our videos and articles.
[00:21:37.716 --> 00:21:39.137]  They force-feed.
[00:21:39.137 --> 00:21:41.098]  They shadow-ban.
[00:21:41.098 --> 00:21:52.346]  And then they're claiming that Facebook is a weapon of Trump because one company in the UK got hired, Cambridge Analytica, by Breitbart to try to get more readers?
[00:21:53.234 --> 00:21:55.837]  That's what you do!
[00:21:55.837 --> 00:22:01.185]  Now, they're conflating it with other stuff the company does that's basically MI6 front group.
[00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:05.505]  Putting leftists in, putting globalists in.
[00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:09.006]  Again, most campaign spending worldwide is for leftists.
[00:22:09.006 --> 00:22:09.246]  Why?
[00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:17.849]  Because George Soros and USAID and the big foundations, they fund leftist garbage because it makes people dependent.
[00:22:17.849 --> 00:22:20.870]  Then the globalists said, offshore, they're all tax-exempt.
[00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.451]  Jeff Bezos, all of them.
[00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:25.792]  And they laugh at you when you're paying high taxes as a blue-collar worker.
[00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:29.980]  Sorry, I'm digressing into how they operate.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.720]  So here it is.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.222]  Obama's former campaign director makes bombshell claim Facebook was, quote, on our side.
[00:22:35.222 --> 00:22:42.444]  A series of Sunday night tweets, Davidson explained how Obama campaign was able to use Facebook to append our email list.
[00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:42.924]  Remember?
[00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:44.865]  What did I say Sunday when I was covering all this?
[00:22:44.865 --> 00:22:52.468]  I said, the basic thing the campaigns do is they just get a profile and a group for tailored email, tailored mailers.
[00:22:53.612 --> 00:22:55.593]  To your houses as well.
[00:22:55.593 --> 00:22:56.874]  And then they hit you with it.
[00:22:56.874 --> 00:22:58.015]  That's what they're doing.
[00:22:58.015 --> 00:22:59.836]  They're getting a list.
[00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:05.359]  Getting a list for political or marketing purposes was not invented by Mr. Pink.
[00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:06.840]  Pink hair, okay?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.040]  But they pick it as this thing.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.981]  Oh, he's a whiz kid.
[00:23:09.981 --> 00:23:11.582]  Oh, oh, oh, he did it.
[00:23:11.582 --> 00:23:13.544]  Oh, look, it's a novelty.
[00:23:13.544 --> 00:23:15.465]  Look, look.
[00:23:15.465 --> 00:23:16.625]  Hawkins is in a wheelchair.
[00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:17.646]  Let's hear what he has to say.
[00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:19.387]  It's the same thing.
[00:23:19.387 --> 00:23:22.449]  So since I mentioned that we reach billions quarterly,
[00:23:23.709 --> 00:23:25.290]  According to Facebook's own analytics.
[00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.771]  Let me show you internal InfoWars analytics.
[00:23:27.771 --> 00:23:29.891]  I'm just going to say that and then I'll show you.
[00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:30.092]  Here's 2016.
[00:23:30.092 --> 00:23:30.692]  And our reach was 6,446,000,000.
[00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:32.593]  And then it goes on from there.
[00:23:32.593 --> 00:23:32.733]  721,000.
[00:23:32.733 --> 00:23:33.893]  And then 2017.
[00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:35.554]  I told you we grew everywhere.
[00:23:35.554 --> 00:23:35.714]  Oh, look. 9,476,944,000.
[00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.411]  So nine billion plus.
[00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:57.556]  Nine and a half billion over six and a half billion.
[00:23:57.556 --> 00:23:58.337]  Nine and a half billion.
[00:23:59.804 --> 00:24:01.445]  From six and a half million.
[00:24:01.445 --> 00:24:02.266]  See that?
[00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:04.167]  Wanna see some other stuff?
[00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:06.468]  You can really get lost in all this.
[00:24:06.468 --> 00:24:11.472]  Oh, by the way, this is just one of our Facebook surrenders.
[00:24:11.472 --> 00:24:12.833]  So, there you go.
[00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:16.735]  Oh my gosh, they got 200 and something thousand people's names.
[00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:18.637]  With that, they leveraged it to five million.
[00:24:18.637 --> 00:24:20.658]  And then they reached 50 million.
[00:24:20.658 --> 00:24:23.060]  Oh, the devastation of Bannon!
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.921]  Oh God, Bannon's so powerful!
[00:24:28.323 --> 00:24:29.784]  In fact, we even have a clip of people panicking.
[00:24:29.784 --> 00:24:31.785]  Can we play that clip?
[00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:38.530]  I saw him play it on the War Room last night where a guy pulls a pocketknife out in a city council meeting like it's no big deal.
[00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.711]  Hey, look at my pocketknife.
[00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:41.692]  Everyone just runs in fear.
[00:24:41.692 --> 00:24:42.913]  Oh, God, Biden!
[00:24:42.913 --> 00:24:44.134]  50 million people!
[00:24:44.134 --> 00:24:45.314]  Ah, here it is!
[00:24:45.314 --> 00:24:48.997]  It would take the cops three to five minutes to come here.
[00:24:48.997 --> 00:24:54.340]  Probably ten if the traffic's bad.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.381]  What are you going to do next?
[00:24:56.525 --> 00:24:59.528]  Oh, it's a four-inch knife.
[00:24:59.528 --> 00:25:04.393]  Unsheathed, unopened.
[00:25:04.393 --> 00:25:12.741]  Call the 911, they're saying it.
[00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:15.103]  In fact, stop it.
[00:25:15.103 --> 00:25:16.604]  I don't want them to hear my junk noises.
[00:25:16.604 --> 00:25:17.726]  Actually listen to the sheep.
[00:25:18.871 --> 00:25:19.632]  He's a nice guy.
[00:25:19.632 --> 00:25:21.093]  His body language is nice.
[00:25:21.093 --> 00:25:22.934]  He's saying, you take the cops the time to get here.
[00:25:22.934 --> 00:25:23.615]  What if I did this?
[00:25:23.615 --> 00:25:24.936]  He pulls out a pocket knife.
[00:25:24.936 --> 00:25:25.737]  Just to illustrate it.
[00:25:25.737 --> 00:25:26.938]  Totally legal.
[00:25:26.938 --> 00:25:28.118]  Cars are giant weapons.
[00:25:28.118 --> 00:25:29.379]  You can use chairs.
[00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:30.180]  They're in a library.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.383]  They got paper cutters right there you can kill somebody with.
[00:25:33.383 --> 00:25:37.826]  But see, to them, it's the sign of a man with a weapon.
[00:25:37.826 --> 00:25:42.390]  And so there's something... It's like one time a lady was choking to death.
[00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.211]  I was in the bathroom.
[00:25:43.211 --> 00:25:43.731]  I come out.
[00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:46.033]  My ex-wife and my son's there.
[00:25:46.033 --> 00:25:47.414]  This takes me back like 15 years ago.
[00:25:47.414 --> 00:25:48.034]  I was like a year old.
[00:25:48.982 --> 00:25:50.242]  Five minutes to come here.
[00:25:50.242 --> 00:25:51.883]  Probably ten if the traffic's bad.
[00:26:17.682 --> 00:26:26.848]  What are you going to do when somebody's got a weapon and there's nobody to protect you?
[00:26:26.848 --> 00:26:29.229]  He's illustrating why they need weapons.
[00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:32.331]  Why they need designated people in the school.
[00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:37.374]  And then the kid runs off to get the police and you've got the air raid sirens now coming in.
[00:26:41.616 --> 00:26:43.177]  The Martians are invading!
[00:26:43.177 --> 00:26:44.277]  Run for the hills!
[00:26:44.277 --> 00:26:46.138]  We're in danger!
[00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:49.259]  Tell them you've got to do something!
[00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:51.820]  So.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.902]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:55.902 --> 00:26:58.963]  9 billion reached 2017.
[00:26:58.963 --> 00:27:01.804]  6 billion reached 2016.
[00:27:01.804 --> 00:27:09.027]  Boy, you want to trigger CNN people, showing them this will certainly do it.
[00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:09.187]  So.
[00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:13.731]  That's what you need to know, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:13.731 --> 00:27:16.052]  And it's all up on every front.
[00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:24.073]  By the way, we just got 20-plus affiliates the last couple of weeks, 12 of them this week.
[00:27:24.073 --> 00:27:25.113]  Those are radio affiliates.
[00:27:25.113 --> 00:27:30.314]  By the way, two of them are right in the middle of San Antonio FM, baby.
[00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:31.715]  Oh yeah, it's just awesome.
[00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:34.135]  Houston's coming online, radio and TV.
[00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:38.676]  Not to mention we're already on Phonoscope 24 hours a day on the main cable channels.
[00:27:40.373 --> 00:27:43.055]  NobleRadio.com is one of the big networks picking us up.
[00:27:43.055 --> 00:27:44.757]  We are excited.
[00:27:44.757 --> 00:27:49.580]  Your persecution has blown up in your big, fat, thug face, CNN.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.104]  Same folks that, you know, a kid made a meme of Trump body slamming CNN so they wanted to sue him.
[00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:57.827]  Same folks that openly called for us to be shut down and tried to get our YouTube shut down.
[00:27:57.827 --> 00:28:00.429]  Same people that are trying to get all our sponsors taken.
[00:28:00.429 --> 00:28:01.830]  Hey, morons!
[00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.111]  Those are YouTube sponsors.
[00:28:03.111 --> 00:28:04.813]  They already demonetized us, you idiots.
[00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:08.041]  But you want to create the illusion we're in trouble.
[00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:09.503]  The illusion we're going down.
[00:28:09.503 --> 00:28:12.646]  My lawyers have looked at all the lawsuits.
[00:28:12.646 --> 00:28:14.608]  They're total BS.
[00:28:14.608 --> 00:28:15.889]  But so you want to run my name to them?
[00:28:15.889 --> 00:28:19.652]  I just announced InfoWars is being sued for trademark infringement.
[00:28:19.652 --> 00:28:20.613]  Not even true!
[00:28:20.613 --> 00:28:21.394]  Totally made up!
[00:28:21.394 --> 00:28:24.077]  Selling somebody else's poster who had authorization to print it.
[00:28:25.063 --> 00:28:26.364]  And we've got all those documents.
[00:28:26.364 --> 00:28:27.064]  I can't believe it.
[00:28:27.064 --> 00:28:29.525]  I mean, this goes beyond slapback, by the way.
[00:28:29.525 --> 00:28:32.146]  It's looking like it's going to be some serious fraud issues.
[00:28:32.146 --> 00:28:39.550]  Then we've got the other stuff with the University of Georgetown suing us, putting in the lawsuit defamatory stuff we didn't say.
[00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.511]  What happens when the judge sees that and there's not evidence of it?
[00:28:42.071 --> 00:28:52.166]  Dismissed, and now Virginia passed slapback in 2017, so I'm gonna sue the university, and I'm gonna sue the individual that falsely put these things in.
[00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:54.429]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:28:54.429 --> 00:28:56.773]  That's a two-way street, Jumbo Jack!
[00:28:59.364 --> 00:29:06.127]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs, so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[00:29:06.127 --> 00:29:10.389]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.
[00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:15.010]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:30.423]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:29:30.423 --> 00:29:32.224]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?

[00:29:36.688 --> 00:29:38.989]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[00:30:00.425 --> 00:30:02.006]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:30:02.006 --> 00:30:04.608]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[00:30:04.608 --> 00:30:12.114]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:22.281]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:30:22.741 --> 00:30:30.588]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:30:30.588 --> 00:30:40.797]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:42.839]  And this part is most important.
[00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:49.285]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:30:49.645 --> 00:30:57.188]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.468]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:31:12.813 --> 00:31:15.675]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:31:15.675 --> 00:31:17.155]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.155 --> 00:31:23.999]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:26.080]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:35.785]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.785 --> 00:31:40.768]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[00:31:40.868 --> 00:31:52.592]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[00:31:55.894 --> 00:32:00.115]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:02.456]  Infowarslife is launching its newest product.
[00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:04.617]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:32:04.617 --> 00:32:07.398]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[00:32:46.408 --> 00:32:49.411]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:32:49.411 --> 00:32:51.453]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:32:51.453 --> 00:32:54.755]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:32:54.755 --> 00:32:57.297]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:32:57.297 --> 00:33:03.882]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:06.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.485 --> 00:33:16.512]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:31.418]  We are living in an extremely historic time.
[00:33:31.418 --> 00:33:33.720]  I think everybody knows that.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:43.388]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones with my intrepid team of researchers that you can see if you're watching on television, backing me up in there and the rest of the crew and you out there across this country and across the world.
[00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:49.434]  Let me just recap some of the top stories to tell you the guests that are coming up because it's it's jam-packed today.
[00:33:49.434 --> 00:33:50.675]  We've got another
[00:33:52.341 --> 00:34:02.507]  Bomb that's gone off, but this time didn't kill anybody, thank God, in San Antonio at a FedEx processing center in San Antonio with delivery to an unnamed address in Austin.
[00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:10.571]  The night before that, you had a bomb go off with a tripwire in a neighborhood on the edge of a greenbelt, injuring two men about a mile and a half from where I live.
[00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:24.810]  And then you had three other bombings that killed two other people before that, and I've now talked to local, state, and federal law enforcement, including one individual that was directly hands-on.
[00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:33.096]  And they're saying, I don't know why it hasn't been released yet, so I'm... A lot of it was technical, it was over the phone this morning, and I should have written it all down, but it's mousetraps.
[00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.055]  Under the package.
[00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:47.260]  And then when you move that, it's got a wire, the mousetrap throws, and I guess it sends a charge through a capacitor, and then that goes in and then detonates the bomb.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:35:03.070]  So it's more sophisticated than what some of the other people were saying, according to this source, because yes, it's a pressure bomb, yes, it's dangerous when you place it, but because you don't hook the wire to the wire that goes to the detonator until you've already set the mousetrap,
[00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:07.267]  It's not as dangerous as some have thought, and it's more sophisticated.
[00:35:08.223 --> 00:35:14.728]  So you're kind of getting the perspectives from, you know, FBI, but FBI that's not the bomb folks, just there at the scene.
[00:35:14.728 --> 00:35:19.052]  Or from police that are there, but not bomb squad or bomb squad.
[00:35:19.052 --> 00:35:22.334]  So we're getting perspectives here, and you're getting exclusives here.
[00:35:22.334 --> 00:35:24.396]  No one else has this.
[00:35:24.396 --> 00:35:27.779]  And we first told you it was a pressure release bomb that came out on Fox News two days later.
[00:35:27.779 --> 00:35:34.304]  I mean, this is directly from every level of the investigation, federal, state, and local, on the ground.
[00:35:35.527 --> 00:35:41.090]  And it's getting more serious, obviously two dead, four or five what injured.
[00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:47.973]  You've got just the hysteria it creates, because everybody's getting packages, pretty much everybody.
[00:35:47.973 --> 00:36:01.679]  I'd say 98% of people get packages, get mail, and you don't know when it's going to blow up, or when you pick the package up, it triggers and blows your arms off, blows your face off.
[00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:21.166]  So it's a real tragedy, and it's just totally senseless, and a lot of people, because of past activity, believe that this may be a Unabomber-type situation.
[00:36:21.166 --> 00:36:24.729]  And that article's up on Infowars.com.
[00:36:24.729 --> 00:36:29.393]  Paul Joseph Watson article, it's linked on DrudgeReport.com as well.
[00:36:30.868 --> 00:36:34.470]  So we're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:38.213]  Getting back into Facebook.
[00:36:38.213 --> 00:36:42.996]  Again, they've lost almost $40 billion over privacy scandal.
[00:36:42.996 --> 00:36:48.580]  Reuters is reporting because it's what the company does.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:37:00.368]  And so if they try to make Trump and Bannon look bad for some little company trying to bottom feed off Facebook, then that opens up Pandora's box and Facebook is the leftist engine
[00:37:02.045 --> 00:37:08.330]  And you got the former head of the Clinton campaign saying that Facebook's on their side and the Democrats own it and all this.
[00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.892]  Well, of course they do!
[00:37:10.892 --> 00:37:14.075]  So it blew up spectacularly.
[00:37:14.075 --> 00:37:14.976]  No pun intended.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:32.153]  Because the media had just covered up Facebook surveilling everybody and selling data and trying to keep you depressed and manipulating you and trying to keep you in a little control room of virtual reality with bots you think are real people manipulating you.
[00:37:32.153 --> 00:37:38.559]  So when you read the Cambridge Analytica article, it's like, Bannon used this to bully users into supporting Trump.
[00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:41.358]  And actually, they were using it for a database.
[00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:44.539]  They weren't as sophisticated as Facebook that actually does use it to bully people.
[00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:47.861]  And you've had Sean Parker go public and others for two years.
[00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:48.741]  That's what's going on.
[00:37:48.741 --> 00:37:55.344]  So they basically, in this article, wrote what Facebook does, but then blamed it on Cambridge Analytica.
[00:37:55.344 --> 00:38:00.447]  But that's now the breadcrumbs right in to Facebook.
[00:38:00.447 --> 00:38:04.529]  So yeah, they kind of self-immolated Bannon and Cambridge Analytica.
[00:38:04.529 --> 00:38:05.309]  They did it themselves.
[00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:06.610]  They poured gasoline all over them.
[00:38:08.243 --> 00:38:20.292]  The idiots, the left, went back to Facebook headquarters with a can of gas around their back but it still had a few gallons in it and it was just leaked with a trail right back in to Facebook headquarters.
[00:38:20.292 --> 00:38:37.345]  So they just torched Cambridge Analytica and the fire line went right back in to Facebook and I'm sitting back at a distance here watching Facebook have a huge mushroom cloud explosion and a whole side of it blow out and about a third of the company just caved in.
[00:38:39.156 --> 00:38:42.758]  I'm like, hey, let's get some hot dogs here, you know?
[00:38:42.758 --> 00:38:44.580]  Facebook doesn't change their ways.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:59.569]  We send everybody to Facebook, we put our material on Facebook, you put your material on Facebook, and then they start ratcheting it down and squeezing it, and not letting you talk to your real friends, and not letting you have real access to information, and then make you pay more and more and more just to talk to your friends.
[00:38:59.569 --> 00:39:01.250]  That's what Facebook is now.
[00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.771]  And you know what?
[00:39:01.771 --> 00:39:02.671]  It's a private company.
[00:39:02.671 --> 00:39:04.312]  If you opt into that, that's your issue.
[00:39:05.438 --> 00:39:14.101]  When they start restricting us for our political speech, and discriminating, if you don't want to bake a cake for anybody, and you want to close your doors, you can do that.
[00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:25.145]  But if you say you're not going to bake a cake for Christians, or conservatives, or gays, or anybody, when you're a big institution under federal law, and I agree with it, you're discriminating, and that's wrong!
[00:39:25.145 --> 00:39:30.627]  I don't want to walk into some gas station, and I got a cross on my shirt, and somebody says, you get out of here because you're a Christian.
[00:39:32.185 --> 00:39:36.406]  As long as it's not obscene, and a gay couple wants to stick two dudes on top of the cake.
[00:39:36.406 --> 00:39:39.067]  Here, get your cake!
[00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:40.528]  Now, is that $500,000?
[00:39:40.528 --> 00:39:41.188]  I don't think so.
[00:39:41.188 --> 00:39:42.588]  But!
[00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:47.970]  You lie about me in the media, and you lie about what I say, and then you won't let me respond on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:50.571]  Twitter's worse, by the way, than Facebook and censorship.
[00:39:50.571 --> 00:39:51.491]  Then what is that?
[00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:59.654]  Because you're not just not letting me have access to the marketplace, you're discriminating against me while you let other people bully me, and then you turn around and say you're a bully.
[00:40:01.516 --> 00:40:13.644]  David Hogg went on TV and said he's being bullied by the NRA and others, that they're scared to debate him, and that they can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:16.987]  I guess the other young person said that, they're both on the show.
[00:40:16.987 --> 00:40:22.271]  Clips on Infowars.com, and, well why not just play the clip, we'll get it queued up.
[00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:28.415]  But again, that's illustrative, that's illustrative of how he challenged me to a debate.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:36.305]  And then he chickened out and the media turned it around and said I was contacting him, bullying him, and he refused to come on.
[00:40:36.305 --> 00:40:41.188]  And then the guy that started a fight with my son in the airport, he said the same thing.
[00:40:41.188 --> 00:40:43.489]  Stop bullying Hogg and try to get him on your show.
[00:40:43.489 --> 00:40:47.352]  And I said, man, Hogg has to come on my show!
[00:40:47.352 --> 00:40:48.613]  He's like, oh no he didn't.
[00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:51.795]  These people are in fruitcake land, man.
[00:40:51.795 --> 00:40:54.677]  Because everything with them, there's no morals.
[00:40:54.677 --> 00:40:56.298]  It's like, okay.
[00:40:58.149 --> 00:40:59.449]  Okay.
[00:40:59.449 --> 00:41:00.290]  I want to debate you.
[00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.570]  Okay?
[00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.230]  I respectfully would like you on.
[00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.471]  No, I'm not going to debate you.
[00:41:03.471 --> 00:41:04.651]  You're a horrible person.
[00:41:04.651 --> 00:41:06.332]  And you're a piece of this and that.
[00:41:06.332 --> 00:41:07.952]  Okay.
[00:41:07.952 --> 00:41:08.732]  Someone in the airport.
[00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:09.413]  How dare you!
[00:41:09.413 --> 00:41:10.833]  Tell him to come on your show, you bully!
[00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:12.173]  Actually, he has to come on.
[00:41:12.173 --> 00:41:12.774]  Ah, whatever.
[00:41:12.774 --> 00:41:15.454]  See, they don't care about reality.
[00:41:15.454 --> 00:41:16.895]  Speaking of that, here's David Hogg.
[00:41:16.895 --> 00:41:18.615]  And what's the girl's name?
[00:41:18.615 --> 00:41:21.856]  With a sh- Abra Gonzales?
[00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:22.757]  Emma Gonzales.
[00:41:22.757 --> 00:41:23.237]  Okay, here it is.
[00:41:24.975 --> 00:41:28.456]  The people at the top of the NRA are no longer working for the people that are in their organization.
[00:41:28.456 --> 00:41:30.357]  They're working on behalf of the gun lobby.
[00:41:30.357 --> 00:41:31.537]  The gun lobby.
[00:41:31.537 --> 00:41:37.959]  And when you talk about the NRA and you make a suggestion like that, what do they say to you?
[00:41:37.959 --> 00:41:39.040]  What does the NRA say to you?
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.140]  Have they been reaching out to you?
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:45.982]  I know that, you know, we had a representative show up at the town hall meeting that you guys participated in, but has the organization been reaching out to you guys?
[00:41:45.982 --> 00:41:48.523]  The way that they've been reaching out to us is basically threatening us.
[00:41:48.703 --> 00:41:53.586]  They've been instigating things, and then when we reply, they shy back away.
[00:41:53.586 --> 00:41:57.169]  They can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[00:41:57.169 --> 00:41:58.189]  Let's talk about the facts.
[00:41:58.189 --> 00:41:59.930]  You can go to both their Twitter feeds.
[00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:10.397]  Both these guys attack this group, attack that organization, call people pieces of the S-word, call them mass murderers, call them killers, burn her.
[00:42:10.397 --> 00:42:12.719]  That's the stuff that goes on with the four kids they've chosen.
[00:42:14.835 --> 00:42:19.058]  She's particularly, you know, called people killers and stuff to their faces.
[00:42:19.058 --> 00:42:27.544]  And then, when they're calling me a piece of you-know-what, when they're calling me a stakeholder, when they're calling me a liar, I'm like, I'd respectfully like you to come on and clear the air, and I'd like to work things out.
[00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:30.486]  And I do believe people were shot there, and I'm glad you survived.
[00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:32.107]  Shut up, you piece of S.H.
[00:42:32.107 --> 00:42:33.048]  whatever.
[00:42:33.048 --> 00:42:39.193]  That then turns into, that then turns into Alex Jones and the NRA, they bullied me.
[00:42:40.339 --> 00:42:44.021]  They bullied our little boo-boos.
[00:42:44.021 --> 00:42:45.362]  By the way, it's not the lobby.
[00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:47.283]  It's called the Second Amendment to Right.
[00:42:47.283 --> 00:42:52.245]  And because it happens to also be associated with property, then we can have a lobby, which is key.
[00:42:52.245 --> 00:42:54.987]  Rights and property together equal freedom.
[00:42:59.235 --> 00:43:03.658]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:43:03.658 --> 00:43:11.743]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:43:11.743 --> 00:43:17.026]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:43:17.026 --> 00:43:19.547]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:43:19.547 --> 00:43:23.790]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.811]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich food
[00:43:27.674 --> 00:43:33.218]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:43:33.218 --> 00:43:35.060]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[00:44:10.499 --> 00:44:18.002]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[00:44:18.002 --> 00:44:19.422]  And then the other two is a
[00:44:19.642 --> 00:44:28.387]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:44:28.387 --> 00:44:33.410]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable Floralife Everyday Maintenance.

[00:44:43.677 --> 00:44:49.080]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.442]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[00:45:04.442 --> 00:45:05.723]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:45:06.676 --> 00:45:07.116]  Great!
[00:45:07.116 --> 00:45:08.257]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:45:08.257 --> 00:45:12.779]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:45:12.779 --> 00:45:14.480]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:21.604]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:45:21.604 --> 00:45:22.624]  Wow, thank you.
[00:45:22.624 --> 00:45:25.266]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:45:25.266 --> 00:45:27.107]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[00:45:27.107 --> 00:45:30.549]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:31.169]  That's amazing.
[00:45:31.189 --> 00:45:31.830]  Incredible.
[00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.892]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:45:34.892 --> 00:45:36.253]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[00:45:36.253 --> 00:45:37.915]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:45:37.915 --> 00:45:48.164]  And I love the guys, I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:45:48.164 --> 00:45:49.205]  You will love it.
[00:45:49.205 --> 00:45:49.725]  I'm telling you.
[00:45:49.725 --> 00:45:51.366]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:45:51.366 --> 00:45:55.790]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:56.651]  It's a win-win.
[00:45:56.651 --> 00:45:57.632]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:46:00.276 --> 00:46:03.078]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:46:03.078 --> 00:46:13.546]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[00:46:13.546 --> 00:46:14.327]  Scalability.
[00:46:14.327 --> 00:46:16.669]  But now we're able to go at 30% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:46:16.669 --> 00:46:18.190]  So there's a lot of product and a lot
[00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:25.214]  It's the other side of the equation.
[00:46:25.214 --> 00:46:34.839]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:43.703]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:46:43.703 --> 00:46:49.666]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:46:50.126 --> 00:46:52.947]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:46:52.947 --> 00:47:03.331]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:05.933]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.494 --> 00:47:22.655]  You found it.
[00:47:22.655 --> 00:47:25.697]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:25.697 --> 00:47:27.819]  It's the InfoWar.
[00:47:27.819 --> 00:47:30.200]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:33.331 --> 00:47:39.013]  Ladies and gentlemen, this just broke one minute ago.
[00:47:39.013 --> 00:47:42.175]  Put out by the state-sponsored RT.
[00:47:42.175 --> 00:47:46.677]  Trump to meet Putin to discuss arms race that is getting out of control.
[00:47:46.677 --> 00:47:54.100]  The president just told the Russian government, President Trump, that he is going to be meeting with Putin.
[00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:55.170]  U.S.
[00:47:55.170 --> 00:48:05.615]  President Donald Trump said he will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the not-too-distant future to discuss an arms race that Trump called out of control.
[00:48:05.615 --> 00:48:11.217]  He also congratulated Putin on his election.
[00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:14.058]  Victory details to follow.
[00:48:14.058 --> 00:48:16.199]  But this just broke.
[00:48:16.199 --> 00:48:20.861]  Trump-Putin want to talk about arms race North Korea.
[00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:21.702]  Again, the full story.
[00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.333]  is on Infowars.com.
[00:48:26.333 --> 00:48:44.407]  Also, he's set to meet in the next month or so with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, forced to come to the table under crippling sanctions that actually affected the communist dictatorship, not just the people, what Trump called the strategy of maximum pressure.
[00:48:46.044 --> 00:48:57.787]  So, major developments unfolding as Trump's winning streak is now, quite frankly, starting to scare me, because something knowing this good, it's just amazing.
[00:48:57.787 --> 00:49:07.250]  I mean, the economy, the borders, the security, the sovereignty, the jobs coming back, the tax cuts crippling and phasing out.
[00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:08.731]  Obamacare.
[00:49:08.731 --> 00:49:18.496]  This is an amazing time to be alive and the globalists are trying to get Trump to be anti-Russian when there's not evidence of Russia involved in anything like Communist China is.
[00:49:18.496 --> 00:49:21.038]  It's Communist China that's infiltrated our government.
[00:49:21.038 --> 00:49:22.579]  That's all confirmed.
[00:49:22.579 --> 00:49:24.580]  So this just broke minutes ago.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.442]  President Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to meet.
[00:49:27.442 --> 00:49:31.064]  The two leaders should set up a possible meeting to discuss the nuclear arms race.
[00:49:31.824 --> 00:49:36.109]  Global terrorism and how to solve tensions in North Korea, according to a report.
[00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:41.055]  The two leaders spoke out in favor of developing practical operation in various areas.
[00:49:41.055 --> 00:49:47.022]  Again, they just spoke today, including in ensuring strategic stability and combating international terrorism.
[00:49:47.643 --> 00:49:49.944]  And again, the Russian government put out their report.
[00:49:49.944 --> 00:49:50.764]  It's the New York Post.
[00:49:50.764 --> 00:49:51.585]  It's buddies with Trump.
[00:49:51.585 --> 00:49:53.326]  Just put this out simultaneously.
[00:49:53.326 --> 00:50:01.429]  In particular, they stress the importance of concerted efforts to curb the arms race, toss the Russian state news agency reported, citing a statement from the Kremlin.
[00:50:01.429 --> 00:50:02.770]  The sides agree to develop further...
[00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:07.614]  Bilateral contacts, including in the context of reshuffles in the U.S.
[00:50:07.614 --> 00:50:11.817]  State Department, special attention was focused on the issue of possible top-level meeting.
[00:50:11.817 --> 00:50:21.426]  The report said the White House said Trump called Putin after the Russian leader widely expected election win on Sunday, giving him another six years.
[00:50:21.426 --> 00:50:24.448]  He won by 70 plus percent, 76 percent.
[00:50:24.448 --> 00:50:26.970]  In a victory speech, 65-year-old Putin said, nobody plans
[00:50:27.732 --> 00:50:29.176]  to accelerate an arms race.
[00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:33.851]  We'll do everything to resolve all the differences with our partners using political
[00:50:36.061 --> 00:50:39.063]  And diplomatic channels, he went on to say.
[00:50:39.063 --> 00:50:40.944]  So, there you go.
[00:50:40.944 --> 00:50:46.548]  Those reports are all being posted to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com as we speak.
[00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:50.391]  We'll continue to watch the ongoing terrible bombings happening in Central Texas.
[00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:57.676]  The fifth such bombing this morning, south of Austin in San Antonio, in a package being delivered to Austin.
[00:50:57.676 --> 00:51:04.221]  We also have details exclusively from the bomb squad and others, that it is mousetrap pressure switches
[00:51:05.021 --> 00:51:11.024]  When the mousetrap gets triggered under the box that then sends an electrical charge detonating the bomb.
[00:51:11.024 --> 00:51:13.305]  So we're going to give you more exclusives on that.
[00:51:13.305 --> 00:51:20.528]  Facebook's down by $40 billion as it was learned that they have been involved in massive spying and political operations for the Democrats.
[00:51:20.528 --> 00:51:25.131]  The Democrats triggered this all coming out by going after Republicans trying to bottom feed
[00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:34.393]  And skim off the Democrat operation, but that is now spectacularly blown up in their little faces, because they don't think two or three or four steps ahead.
[00:51:34.393 --> 00:51:45.515]  And the former head of the Clinton campaign has gone public saying, quote, you know, they work with Facebook, they own Facebook, they control Facebook, and quote, Facebook is on our side.
[00:51:45.515 --> 00:51:50.997]  That's a Zero Hedge article, also up on InfoWars.com.
[00:51:50.997 --> 00:51:52.977]  Now, stopping right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:54.386 --> 00:51:56.768]  We are getting more affiliates.
[00:51:56.768 --> 00:51:59.450]  And we are getting a lot of new TV stations picking us up.
[00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:07.655]  But there have been massive costs involved with putting us on more satellites, putting in the crew to reach out to the stations, and to service the stations, and the things that go with that.
[00:52:07.655 --> 00:52:21.785]  So we are not behind the eight ball financially, but with the 12 suits that lawyers for Hillary Clinton and others, and Georgetown University, and State Department officials have filed against us, all the suits can be beaten in court.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:36.363]  In fact, they can be beaten very easily, but it still takes preparing and going in for the summary judgments, then we have to hit them with slap statutes to get the attorney's fees back, and then counter-sue so they stop doing it, or they'll just keep doing it until we're destroyed.
[00:52:36.363 --> 00:52:40.984]  So it is your prayers, it is your support that is absolutely critical, and the reason we're here.
[00:52:40.984 --> 00:52:42.944]  But I want to thank all the new affiliates picking us up.
[00:52:42.944 --> 00:52:45.625]  I want to thank all the old affiliates that have stood by us.
[00:52:45.625 --> 00:52:47.285]  You've seen this broadcast bear fruit.
[00:52:48.479 --> 00:52:49.600]  You've seen InfoWars grow.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.861]  You've seen a patriot president.
[00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:55.783]  You've seen things that are just hard to believe five years ago now happening.
[00:52:55.783 --> 00:52:58.084]  And that's because good exists, not just evil.
[00:52:58.084 --> 00:53:00.966]  So for myself and the crew, thank you for your support.
[00:53:00.966 --> 00:53:04.268]  And please, when you're shopping and you need supplements,

[00:53:45.279 --> 00:53:47.761]  You can click cancel anytime.
[00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:50.122]  But then you'll get the colloidal silver you want every month.
[00:53:50.122 --> 00:53:51.563]  You'll get the Micro ZX.
[00:53:51.563 --> 00:53:55.826]  You'll get the Wake Up America coffee that people love so much.
[00:53:55.826 --> 00:53:56.707]  They don't even plug anymore.
[00:53:56.707 --> 00:53:58.348]  It's becoming really one of our best sellers.
[00:53:58.348 --> 00:53:59.228]  Didn't used to be.
[00:53:59.228 --> 00:54:01.830]  I was thinking about stopping doing the coffee a couple years ago.
[00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.092]  And now Tim's like, wow, this is like just selling off the shelves.
[00:54:05.092 --> 00:54:06.413]  But it is because we also, it's quality.
[00:54:06.413 --> 00:54:08.314]  We sell it for a very affordable price.
[00:54:08.314 --> 00:54:09.575]  That's one reason I looked at getting rid of it.
[00:54:09.575 --> 00:54:10.756]  We mentioned like five dollars a bag.
[00:54:10.856 --> 00:54:11.497]  on it.
[00:54:11.497 --> 00:54:16.361]  That's not a lot of money, folks, compared to other people selling coffee at this quality.
[00:54:16.361 --> 00:54:20.344]  The very same stuff sells in Whole Foods for $30 a bag.
[00:54:20.344 --> 00:54:22.266]  It's the exact same stuff from Chiapas.
[00:54:22.266 --> 00:54:22.726]  It's excellent.
[00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:24.247]  It's like Guatemalan, but better.
[00:54:24.247 --> 00:54:25.829]  Anyways, I'm gonna stop ranting.
[00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.871]  It's Paul Joseph Watson mug.
[00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:28.791]  It's all in there.
[00:54:28.791 --> 00:54:30.433]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:31.233]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:54:34.378 --> 00:54:35.861]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:54:35.861 --> 00:54:40.448]  And pollen block for seasonal discomfort, all the pollen and garbage.
[00:54:40.448 --> 00:54:48.039]  When I forget to take it during this hay fever season, it's spring down here, my eyes are watering, my nose is watering, and Daria's like, take your pollen block.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.181]  Hour later, 90% reduced.
[00:54:51.181 --> 00:54:54.162]  It's like I'm not a pill popper myself.
[00:54:54.162 --> 00:54:57.143]  But this isn't like Tylenol or something that eats your liver.
[00:54:57.143 --> 00:55:00.604]  All this stuff is natural from Mother Nature and it works really, really great.
[00:55:00.604 --> 00:55:03.845]  That's why there's tens of thousands of reviews on the site for the products.
[00:55:05.003 --> 00:55:06.744]  MycoZX has been sold out for months.
[00:55:06.744 --> 00:55:08.504]  It's the other side of the equation for probiotics.
[00:55:08.504 --> 00:55:11.085]  We've got probiotics that are excellent as well.
[00:55:11.085 --> 00:55:17.188]  But it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, the fungus, the slime walls, where it takes over your guts.
[00:55:17.188 --> 00:55:18.848]  And MycoZX is amazing.
[00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:20.029]  We've signed a year contract.
[00:55:20.831 --> 00:55:30.194]  Got even more concentrated, stronger per capsule, more in each bottle, and I got it for 30% less than I was getting it before, so I passed the savings on.
[00:55:30.194 --> 00:55:33.495]  Normal retail was 80, used to sell for about 60.
[00:55:33.495 --> 00:55:35.175]  Now, I can get it for less.
[00:55:35.175 --> 00:55:37.596]  Well, now normal retail is 60, right now it's $27.
[00:55:37.596 --> 00:55:38.656]  We normally mark it up 100%.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:47.845]  When we cut it down that much, ladies and gentlemen, it is either a break-even or we might make three or four dollars.
[00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:51.669]  But I want you to see how great it is so you keep reordering it at the regular price.
[00:55:51.669 --> 00:55:52.710]  It's already a great deal.
[00:55:52.710 --> 00:56:03.980]  We also now have a new part of the silver family on our website, the Super Blue System of the fluoride-free toothpaste, 4-5-Acolytl Silver 9-9, and the great Lung Cleanse product as well that's amazing.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:11.986]  So thick, though, of essential oil, there's no filler that you gotta clean out the top sometimes if you haven't used it in a while, because it is amazing, the amount of product in this.
[00:56:11.986 --> 00:56:12.747]  Here's an example.
[00:56:12.747 --> 00:56:15.830]  The little one-ounce Super Blue bottle is $3.
[00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:19.493]  It has $3 of product and cost in it.
[00:56:19.493 --> 00:56:20.654]  $3.
[00:56:20.654 --> 00:56:23.917]  Leading competitors with something that is even similar, 50 cents in product.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:24.640]  I'm
[00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:45.802]  We're good to go.
[00:56:55.882 --> 00:57:00.545]  To go there and get the products you already need that are life-changing, it funds this operation.
[00:57:00.545 --> 00:57:09.930]  It stands in the way of the CNN bullies and Soros and the globalists in Georgetown and the New World Order and the CIA and the leftists that are trying to crush us.
[00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:15.693]  I'm going to go on no matter what happens, but I feel really good under this massive attack because it's like magic.
[00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:19.596]  Every time they attack us, the support comes right in, right at the level we need.
[00:57:20.356 --> 00:57:27.139]  And as a guy that really wants to dominate and win, I just keep thinking, man, I really want a ton more to come in that really takes us over the top.
[00:57:27.139 --> 00:57:28.720]  And it's like, no, you're going to get what you need.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.720]  You don't always get what you want, you get what you need.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.321]  But we're expanding in the face of this, and they hate it and they know it.
[00:57:33.321 --> 00:57:35.462]  And they know the light of liberty is more popular than ever.
[00:57:35.462 --> 00:57:38.104]  So please, think about us today in fullmorestore.com.
[00:57:38.104 --> 00:57:39.864]  And I want to thank you for your financial support.

[00:57:42.845 --> 00:57:45.006]  You cannot lose unless you don't take action.
[00:57:45.006 --> 00:57:48.608]  But whatever you do, spread the live links to the show online and tell folks about the local stations.

[00:59:10.086 --> 00:59:12.208]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[00:59:53.380 --> 01:00:02.069]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:07.555]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:00:07.555 --> 01:00:08.816]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.099 --> 01:00:26.580]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:35.822]  The man known as Count Dankula is more of a liberal, and that's what his profile is to show, liberal libertarian, that doesn't matter.
[01:00:35.822 --> 01:00:44.083]  And a few years ago he did the Hitler dog joke, where he got his dog to say Sieg Heil.
[01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:48.064]  Now Charlie Chaplin did similar jokes, Monty Python did similar jokes,
[01:00:49.158 --> 01:00:50.759]  But does it matter?
[01:00:50.759 --> 01:01:04.803]  Now in the UK, if you teach your dog to howl Hitler and get 10 million views in a day, does it matter even if you're even trending towards kind of anti-fush?
[01:01:04.803 --> 01:01:07.424]  The guy's been on, he's like a liberal.
[01:01:07.424 --> 01:01:09.364]  You get jail time.
[01:01:09.364 --> 01:01:17.507]  The UK court is now saying he's convicted, he's being sentenced, and we're looking to get him to pop in as soon as the sentencing happens today.
[01:01:18.939 --> 01:01:23.564]  He's facing six months in jail and a huge fine for hurting people's feelings.
[01:01:23.564 --> 01:01:28.649]  So, that's how the EU is, restricting laws, restricting free speech, and now that's here.
[01:01:28.649 --> 01:01:30.210]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:35.275]  YouTuber convicted for offensive joke video faces prison.
[01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:37.798]  Can't make that up.
[01:01:37.798 --> 01:01:40.641]  So, without further ado, here's Paul Watson breaking it down from a year ago.
[01:01:42.056 --> 01:01:49.919]  Eight-year-old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans.
[01:01:49.919 --> 01:01:56.762]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[01:01:56.762 --> 01:02:04.345]  And so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:05.606]  Buddha!
[01:02:05.606 --> 01:02:09.407]  Do you want to gas the Jews?
[01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:10.068]  Gas the Jews?
[01:02:12.944 --> 01:02:13.366]  Deuce.
[01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:17.402]  See you Kyle!
[01:02:17.402 --> 01:02:17.743]  Deuce.
[01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:34.018]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200 thumbs down.
[01:02:34.018 --> 01:02:44.661]  The vast majority of viewers thought that it was hilarious, but thanks to a small minority of perpetually offended retards, Meechan got a home visit from the Scottish police.
[01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:52.943]  Authorities said that Meechan's arrest is a lesson to others that any video content deemed offensive will not be tolerated.
[01:02:53.063 --> 01:02:59.907]  Meechan then prostrated himself, pleading that he wasn't a racist and that he only made the video to annoy his girlfriend.
[01:02:59.907 --> 01:03:04.870]  Isn't it interesting that John Cleese recently came out and decried political correctness?
[01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:11.094]  Because under that definition, Cleese himself would have been arrested for this Fawlty Towers sketch.
[01:03:11.094 --> 01:03:12.535]  Who's this then?
[01:03:12.535 --> 01:03:13.896]  Start you, man!
[01:03:13.896 --> 01:03:17.918]  I'll do the funny one!
[01:03:17.918 --> 01:03:18.699]  In time!
[01:03:22.659 --> 01:03:26.803]  He would have also been hit with hate crimes charges for this Monty Python sketch.
[01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:43.481]  Charlie Chaplin would have been thrown in a jail cell for the same reason.
[01:03:43.481 --> 01:03:51.405]  If they're now treating any video content whatsoever that causes offence as hate speech, then my entire channel is hate speech.
[01:03:51.405 --> 01:03:57.807]  It's getting close to where I'm going to have to leave the country simply to continue to make YouTube videos.
[01:03:57.807 --> 01:04:02.329]  They're already arresting people who criticise Muslim immigration on Twitter.
[01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:03.070]  Now satire?
[01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:08.772]  Frigging satire that's not even malicious will not be tolerated.
[01:04:08.772 --> 01:04:10.973]  And this is by no means a one-off case.
[01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:19.177]  Just a few days ago, a Muslim police chief in Manchester said, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture, religion or tradition.
[01:04:19.177 --> 01:04:26.840]  Just last month, Greater Glasgow Police threatened to conduct home visits to harass people who made unkind or inaccurate tweets.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:34.403]  Last year, Police Scotland announced their intention to investigate offensive comments made on Twitter and other social media platforms.
[01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:39.365]  Of course, this is all selectively enforced, but the chilling effect is very real.
[01:04:39.365 --> 01:04:42.786]  This is how political correctness is strangling freedom.
[01:04:42.786 --> 01:04:48.468]  People are going to be terrified of expressing any political belief, even if it's satirical.
[01:04:48.988 --> 01:04:50.770]  Even if it's not even meant to be part of it.
[01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:51.670]  Alright, we're going to go on a break.
[01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.112]  The full report is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:54.112 --> 01:04:58.756]  But they are now banning anti-Nazis making Nazi jokes.
[01:04:58.756 --> 01:05:08.245]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Son, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:08.245 --> 01:05:12.929]  Winner's Son is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:12.929 --> 01:05:14.450]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:14.870]  I think?
[01:05:34.304 --> 01:05:39.689]  As verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:05:39.689 --> 01:05:44.694]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[01:05:44.694 --> 01:05:50.620]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.763]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:05:52.763 --> 01:05:55.385]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:22.477]  Alexander Nikrasov is going to be joining us for the next 30 minutes from Russia.
[01:06:22.477 --> 01:06:26.518]  He is a
[01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:39.431]  TV presenter, researcher, host, he's all over BBC, you name it, U.S.
[01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:41.412]  television, a lot of people will recognize him.
[01:06:41.412 --> 01:06:49.015]  And I wanted to get him on about Putin's big landslide election with 76 plus percent running as an independent.
[01:06:49.015 --> 01:06:49.795]  Because I saw U.S.
[01:06:49.795 --> 01:06:58.199]  media saying Putin's a dictator, but they won't say that the Chinese president is elected by the Communist Party, the Central Committee.
[01:06:59.028 --> 01:07:00.391]  The Politburo.
[01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:03.277]  And that the Communist Party holds dictatorship since 1949.
[01:07:03.277 --> 01:07:05.843]  They've killed 80 plus million people.
[01:07:05.843 --> 01:07:08.048]  And then the party holds all power in the country.
[01:07:09.471 --> 01:07:16.116]  And then Putin ran as an independent, they have a parliamentary system, they had a general election, and he's now been re-elected.
[01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:21.100]  When you're elected, and even mainstream, some US news admits he's very popular in polls.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.541]  In fact, they thought he might get 80%.
[01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:31.247]  So this isn't some Russophile thing I'm involved in, where if you're not anti-Russia, you know, you're a communist agent or something.
[01:07:32.188 --> 01:07:35.491]  It's the globalists, in my view, that are acting like the old Soviet Union.
[01:07:35.491 --> 01:07:41.317]  It's the EU that's unelected, and Juncker is unelected, but then he calls Putin the dictator.
[01:07:41.317 --> 01:07:47.142]  So, Alexander joins us, Alexander Nekrasov, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:07:47.142 --> 01:07:50.385]  He's a former Kremlin and government advisor, Russian journalist and broadcaster.
[01:07:50.385 --> 01:07:57.612]  He's a regular grandson of the famous giant of Russian poetry, and a nephew of Leo Tolstoy.
[01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:03.494]  He is a frequent commentator on various international TV channels and radio, as well as British, American, and Russian media.
[01:08:03.494 --> 01:08:06.395]  He's an expert on international relations.
[01:08:06.395 --> 01:08:12.576]  Alexander first worked at TASS and the Soviet Press Agency, first as a reporter, and then it just goes through all the things he's done.
[01:08:12.576 --> 01:08:15.817]  And we'll put up his Twitter on screen for you.
[01:08:15.817 --> 01:08:20.379]  You can also follow him at Twitter at StirringTroubleWithTwoRs.
[01:08:20.379 --> 01:08:22.539]  So, he joins us now.
[01:08:22.539 --> 01:08:23.860]  Alexander, good to have you on with us.
[01:08:25.031 --> 01:08:26.992]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:08:26.992 --> 01:08:30.054]  Well, a few words about Putin's election because it just happened.
[01:08:56.141 --> 01:09:03.528]  And first of all, I'd like to say that, you know, elections in every country have problems, right?
[01:09:03.528 --> 01:09:09.895]  For example, I live in Britain, and in Britain, you don't need to show your ID when you're voting.
[01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:14.820]  Now, when I say this to people from other countries, they don't believe me.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.823]  And, you know, when anyone can take the
[01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:31.118]  piece of paper you've been sent to come into the, you know, for voting center and just simply say, hi, I am this guy or this woman and vote and just leave.
[01:09:31.118 --> 01:09:33.259]  You must understand there's something wrong with it, right?
[01:09:33.259 --> 01:09:39.764]  Now, we can go through many elections across the world, including the West, by the way.
[01:09:39.764 --> 01:09:46.749]  For example, last year in France, Macron, whom nobody knew, and I have friends in France, my father was born in France,
[01:09:47.409 --> 01:09:48.250]  My late father.
[01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:53.794]  And I can tell you, nobody knew who he was, where his party came from.
[01:09:53.794 --> 01:09:57.497]  That party consisted of some very strange people.
[01:09:57.497 --> 01:10:03.301]  And suddenly they got two thirds of Parliament and he won very convincingly.
[01:10:03.301 --> 01:10:06.704]  Now, you know, call me naive.
[01:10:06.704 --> 01:10:08.165]  I don't understand how that works.
[01:10:08.757 --> 01:10:13.038]  The EU was sort of standing aside and saying, well, we don't know.
[01:10:13.038 --> 01:10:13.638]  We don't know.
[01:10:13.638 --> 01:10:15.439]  It's democracy, you see.
[01:10:15.439 --> 01:10:21.860]  So what I'm saying here, of course there are problems with every election in every country.
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:27.202]  And of course there are officials on the ground who would like to, you know, to do something.
[01:10:27.202 --> 01:10:30.583]  To put their finger on the scale.
[01:10:30.583 --> 01:10:34.203]  Yeah, you know, to please the bosses upstairs.
[01:10:34.203 --> 01:10:36.384]  And of course there will be something happening, but
[01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:41.615]  In Putin's, in case of Putin, one thing that must be understood.
[01:10:41.615 --> 01:10:44.976]  Russia is in a very difficult situation now.
[01:10:44.976 --> 01:10:52.499]  For the first time in many, many decades, foreign troops, NATO troops, are on its border.
[01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:53.279]  On its border.
[01:10:53.279 --> 01:10:58.321]  This is not, you know, somewhere in Germany or Britain or France.
[01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:01.962]  They are now on its border, all along the eastern border.
[01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:18.116]  There are troops even in Ukraine which has always been seen by the Russians as basically a brotherly nation and what happened in Ukraine I must tell you probably spoiled relations with the West well for the next hundred years.
[01:11:18.396 --> 01:11:33.130]  I mean, Soros brags he went in there, instead on Fareed Zarkaria, they spent $5 billion, State Department money, a billion of his, to overthrow the government, then to try to take over the oil fields and gas fields, and to start a civil war, they put admitted Nazis that how Hitler
[01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:33.991]  I don't know.
[01:11:49.853 --> 01:11:57.784]  Russia has general elections, it's a parliamentary system, and if you dig into State Department reports, they admit they thought Putin would win with 80%.
[01:11:57.784 --> 01:12:00.107]  So he won with 76%, correct?
[01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:03.131]  So the point is, that's not a dictator when you're elected with 76%.
[01:12:05.526 --> 01:12:17.290]  Well, I agree with that, but the most important thing of all is that you can have a democratic election, like you have in some countries, but you must judge the election by the impact it has on the country.
[01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:23.092]  You know, it's all very nice to say, well, people decided they have this leader or that leader.
[01:12:23.092 --> 01:12:25.773]  Watch what happens after that.
[01:12:25.773 --> 01:12:30.895]  Is the leader, the government, the regime, is acting in the interest of the people?
[01:12:31.599 --> 01:12:37.103]  Or is it acting in the interest of a tiny clique of people and ignores the rest?
[01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.924]  Now that's the real issue.
[01:12:38.924 --> 01:12:42.046]  And so why do Russians like Putin?
[01:12:42.046 --> 01:12:44.028]  And why do they keep reelecting him in record numbers?
[01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:46.990]  Because my grandpa always said, I don't want to hear talk, I want to see action.
[01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:49.491]  Judge a tree by its fruit, as the Bible says.
[01:12:49.491 --> 01:12:51.773]  So why do Russians love Putin so much?
[01:12:53.012 --> 01:12:56.515]  Well, I think it's not love, it's pragmatism.
[01:12:56.515 --> 01:13:08.264]  I think they understand that Putin probably is the best candidate of them all to provide security for the country, because security is the number one issue on their agenda now.
[01:13:08.264 --> 01:13:13.829]  Secondly, none of the candidates were really strong in offering any new
[01:13:18.155 --> 01:13:18.676]  Sure, sure.
[01:13:18.676 --> 01:13:23.299]  So why does the West, why does the Western Left in Hollywood hate Putin so much?
[01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:24.339]  I mean, for me, I know why.
[01:13:24.339 --> 01:13:25.080]  I know them.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.822]  You know, the Bolsheviks and things kind of got run out of New York and London.
[01:13:28.822 --> 01:13:30.403]  That's where Bernie Sanders went and had his honeymoon.
[01:13:30.403 --> 01:13:34.326]  And I know you were previously in that whole system, but I think it's pretty horrible.
[01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:35.707]  I think what Putin's doing in many ways is good.
[01:13:35.707 --> 01:13:37.288]  The Christianity, the free market.
[01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:38.068]  I like the reform.
[01:13:38.068 --> 01:13:43.972]  So that's why I see Hollywood and the Left seeing their little wonderland of stomping Christians' guts out.
[01:13:44.672 --> 01:13:52.979]  Well, I mean, Hollywood hates Putin, hates Russia, hates anybody who is not a liberal.
[01:13:52.979 --> 01:13:54.760]  Let's be honest about it.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:02.906]  Hollywood is in a sense a suspect of neoliberalism, you know, militant liberalism.
[01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.427]  Yes, it's militant now.
[01:14:04.427 --> 01:14:05.568]  It's gone over the top.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.343]  I wouldn't really judge what Hollywood is saying.
[01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:17.770]  But you know it's Hollywood driving the foaming at the mouth Russia hate.
[01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:20.693]  Well, unfortunately, you know a lot of people in the West
[01:14:21.434 --> 01:14:21.734]  I think?
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.540]  In the US.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:44.982]  But instead, it's the globalists, it's Hollywood, it's the EU, it's the devil pope.
[01:14:44.982 --> 01:14:48.404]  They're the ones that are trying to destroy me right now.
[01:14:48.404 --> 01:14:55.047]  There's not any Russians involved anywhere with me, except for Daria, who worked for Army Special Operations as a patriot.
[01:14:55.047 --> 01:15:00.789]  That's how sick this is, is I judge a tree by my fruits, and I have globalists trying to destroy my country.
[01:15:00.789 --> 01:15:02.490]  The same globalists that want to destroy you.
[01:15:03.991 --> 01:15:09.633]  Well, the problem is here, of course, because there is a reason why Russia is considered an enemy.
[01:15:09.633 --> 01:15:15.655]  First of all, there is a lot of distraction going on from the problems at home.
[01:15:15.655 --> 01:15:25.778]  Now, the economy, for example, in Britain, where the spying scandal is all over the pages of the press, the economy is in terrible shape.
[01:15:25.778 --> 01:15:31.040]  The corruption in politics has become such that I would compare to Zimbabwe.
[01:15:31.812 --> 01:15:38.956]  Things are happening that I don't believe happened in Russia in the worst times of the 1990s under Yeltsin.
[01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:39.456]  This is key.
[01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:40.657]  Stay right there.
[01:15:40.657 --> 01:15:50.522]  Let's explain this when we come back and the fact that even today Russia is in a battle just like America with the very same foaming at the mouth liberals that want our kids, our culture, our churches.
[01:15:50.522 --> 01:15:52.564]  I mean, they want to conquer us.
[01:15:52.564 --> 01:15:54.465]  We'll be back with our special guest from Russia.
[01:15:54.465 --> 01:15:54.845]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.261]  Attention business owners and independent contractors.

[01:16:54.052 --> 01:17:02.135]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[01:17:02.135 --> 01:17:07.856]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:10.037]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[01:17:13.038 --> 01:17:14.999]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[01:17:14.999 --> 01:17:17.360]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.321]  See guidelines.
[01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:21.603]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.544]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:17:23.544 --> 01:17:25.385]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:17:26.894 --> 01:17:27.794]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:17:27.794 --> 01:17:30.196]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:17:30.196 --> 01:17:38.340]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.281]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:43.983]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:17:43.983 --> 01:17:48.705]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:53.147]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:17:53.147 --> 01:17:53.788]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:17:58.499 --> 01:18:01.300]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:11.765]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:18:11.765 --> 01:18:12.565]  Scalability.
[01:18:12.565 --> 01:18:15.047]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[01:18:15.047 --> 01:18:16.547]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot
[01:18:20.969 --> 01:18:23.271]  It's the other side of the equation.
[01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:33.078]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because you have toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[01:18:33.078 --> 01:18:41.944]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:18:41.944 --> 01:18:47.908]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:18:48.348 --> 01:18:51.169]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:58.291]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the InfoWars store.
[01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:01.691]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:01.691 --> 01:19:05.672]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:05.672 --> 01:19:09.013]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:09.013 --> 01:19:11.534]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:11.534 --> 01:19:15.895]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:18.618]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:19:18.618 --> 01:19:25.646]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:25.646 --> 01:19:32.814]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:38.878]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:38.878 --> 01:19:46.523]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:19:46.523 --> 01:19:51.426]  Boost, protect, and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[01:19:51.426 --> 01:19:53.727]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:20:01.577 --> 01:20:22.012]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.012 --> 01:20:28.356]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.774 --> 01:20:32.835]  Alexander Nekrasov is a journalist.
[01:20:32.835 --> 01:20:33.655]  He's in London.
[01:20:33.655 --> 01:20:38.216]  But when I say the view from Russia, I mean a Russian's view on what's going on.
[01:20:38.216 --> 01:20:42.678]  And again, I've never been to Russia, but I've been a history buff.
[01:20:42.678 --> 01:20:48.059]  And I do intend to probably go there in the later summer now because I've got to get my Achilles fixed soon.
[01:20:48.059 --> 01:20:50.720]  It's 100% blown now, and I've just been walking on it for four years.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.180]  It's only 80% blown.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.961]  But I'm going to go to Russia because I want to go see who my bosses supposedly are.
[01:20:55.961 --> 01:20:57.102]  It's ridiculous.
[01:20:58.383 --> 01:21:01.865]  And, again, he's an expert in international relations.
[01:21:01.865 --> 01:21:03.227]  He's joining us.
[01:21:03.227 --> 01:21:17.578]  He's covered many of the big events, like what he was getting into the early 1990s, Yeltsin attacking the Duma and the Parliament with tanks when they wouldn't leave, and go with the election, and then the rise of Putin, and just all the things we've seen in our age.
[01:21:17.578 --> 01:21:22.643]  And then NATO double-crossing and then going up on the Russian borders.
[01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:23.664]  That's really what happened.
[01:21:24.486 --> 01:21:27.747]  And again, that's from my perspective, just looking at what goes on.
[01:21:27.747 --> 01:21:37.529]  Our media is so fake that when Georgia attacked South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 888, our media said Russia has attacked Georgia.
[01:21:37.529 --> 01:21:40.570]  And I believed CNN when I got up at 6 a.m.
[01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:48.851]  Until about two hours in, I was reading foreign news and it was like, no, the Georgians attacked these areas that were UN-held, killed a bunch of people.
[01:21:48.851 --> 01:21:50.732]  The Russians just pushed them out and then left.
[01:21:51.761 --> 01:22:00.706]  So, that's when I became the Russophile, according to the media, when I went, CNN lied, Russia didn't start that.
[01:22:01.693 --> 01:22:05.155]  And that's when I realized, my God, they're really trying to start a new Cold War.
[01:22:05.155 --> 01:22:07.797]  Well, if they were communist over there, that'd be another thing.
[01:22:07.797 --> 01:22:10.779]  We need a Cold War with Hollywood, with the Democratic Party.
[01:22:10.779 --> 01:22:11.820]  They're the enemy, man.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.421]  Get them out of here.
[01:22:13.421 --> 01:22:15.202]  Stop them culturally.
[01:22:15.202 --> 01:22:16.963]  They're the enemy, not the Russians.
[01:22:16.963 --> 01:22:23.888]  And the globalists are allied with the communist Chinese, who just made him dictator for life with his vice president.
[01:22:23.888 --> 01:22:30.772]  But the Austin American statesman said elected president, elected vice president by the permanent communist party.
[01:22:30.772 --> 01:22:31.533]  Putin was not.
[01:22:42.777 --> 01:22:53.081]  Well, I think it's not going to be easy because there's going to be pressure on Trump in America from people who don't like Russia and don't want to have anything to do with Russia.
[01:22:53.081 --> 01:23:01.324]  And I can tell you, Alex, last week in New York, you had the biggest gathering of experts on Russia, you know, from the West.
[01:23:01.989 --> 01:23:04.271]  And guess what they've decided in New York?
[01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:10.836]  They've decided that Russia is an enemy of the West, it should be destroyed and so on and so on.
[01:23:10.836 --> 01:23:15.179]  So that's the experts, experts are talking about Russia.
[01:23:15.179 --> 01:23:18.762]  So you can imagine the pressures on both presidents.
[01:23:18.762 --> 01:23:21.284]  In Russia there are people who do not trust America.
[01:23:21.844 --> 01:23:24.026]  I can tell you this, even in power.
[01:23:24.026 --> 01:23:27.148]  And they will say, look, we can't trust these guys.
[01:23:27.148 --> 01:23:28.949]  They took over Ukraine.
[01:23:28.949 --> 01:23:30.810]  They are surrounding us.
[01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:32.791]  They are meddling in our affairs.
[01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:38.235]  They are making up stories that we are taking their elections and so on.
[01:23:38.235 --> 01:23:45.699]  And at the same time, the budget of the CIA is 20 times more than the budget of the Russian intelligence service.
[01:23:45.699 --> 01:23:47.100]  They are lying to their people.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.081]  They are attacking us.
[01:23:48.081 --> 01:23:51.003]  They are waging a cyber war against us and so on.
[01:23:51.463 --> 01:23:57.086]  So you can imagine both of them will be under great pressure to basically agree on anything.
[01:23:57.086 --> 01:24:05.051]  I don't really think it's going to be a big decision-making meeting, but it has a big symbolism under it.
[01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:06.452]  And I think it's very important.
[01:24:06.452 --> 01:24:07.833]  They need to talk.
[01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:09.694]  You know, these leaders need to talk.
[01:24:10.194 --> 01:24:17.863]  This is good that they are going to meet one-on-one because I don't trust those sons, you know?
[01:24:17.863 --> 01:24:23.489]  They get together, they don't do much there, they do their own thing there, and nothing is decided.
[01:24:24.991 --> 01:24:43.965]  Trump and President Putin should throw the gauntlet down and statistically expose who's really involved in things and what the globalists are doing and point out that Russia has all these resources, wants to be modernized, wants to work with us and has sent all those signals and helped us after 9-11 and helped us take out ISIS.
[01:24:44.625 --> 01:24:46.286]  And Trump's very pragmatic, I can tell you.
[01:24:46.286 --> 01:24:48.388]  I know people that know Trump very well.
[01:24:48.388 --> 01:24:51.550]  And he absolutely thinks this is a load of crap.
[01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:54.593]  He doesn't want to be in conflict with Russia.
[01:24:54.593 --> 01:24:57.855]  And a lot of the military says we should work with Russia.
[01:24:57.855 --> 01:25:00.037]  Geographically, it's a match made in heaven.
[01:25:00.037 --> 01:25:03.019]  But the globalists, the neocons, they want to control the chessboard.
[01:25:03.379 --> 01:25:06.081]  They want to control radical Islam, flood Europe with that.
[01:25:06.081 --> 01:25:08.302]  They want to control Russia, cut Russia off.
[01:25:08.302 --> 01:25:11.083]  And the globalists want to destroy the power of America.
[01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:16.647]  They want to phase our power into this global corporate system that threatens Russia and the United States.
[01:25:16.647 --> 01:25:19.768]  I think that's why we have to not be intimidated to have these meetings.
[01:25:19.768 --> 01:25:20.969]  I agree.
[01:25:20.969 --> 01:25:27.113]  Trump should have met with Putin first, since they made such a big deal about it, and kill it right there, and say it's not wrong.
[01:25:27.113 --> 01:25:28.073]  I'm the president.
[01:25:28.073 --> 01:25:28.854]  You elected me.
[01:25:29.554 --> 01:25:33.255]  I'm allowed to talk and work with whoever I want, unitary executive.
[01:25:33.255 --> 01:25:38.197]  They're saying Mueller and CNN holds the president's fate like he's the fourth branch of government.
[01:25:38.197 --> 01:25:38.938]  No!
[01:25:38.938 --> 01:25:39.378]  No!
[01:25:39.378 --> 01:25:47.701]  Even if Trump was caught doing stuff with the Russians, which we know wasn't true, it's still his right and the people's right to say we want our president to talk to this group or that group.
[01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:51.163]  Well, the problem with the American public is that
[01:26:10.336 --> 01:26:16.297]  A lot of people in America believe the media too much, and unfortunately the world of entertainment as well.
[01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:25.579]  Now I can tell you that a lot of you Americans think that what they see on Saturday Night Live is actually real politics.
[01:26:25.579 --> 01:26:34.360]  And they make their decision based on that stupid, idiotic, I think, comedy series where nobody even bothers to act, by the way.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.901]  If you notice, they can't even remember their lines.
[01:26:37.572 --> 01:26:47.076]  And the world of entertainment, I think there's a lot of responsibility in America, I mean, for the feelings of some people towards Russia.
[01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:50.637]  You just mentioned Red Sparrow, but is it just Red Sparrow?
[01:26:50.637 --> 01:26:55.419]  I mean, how many films have depicted Russians as spies, killers?
[01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:57.060]  What about the Russian Mafia?
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.940]  Where the hell is the Russian Mafia?
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:01.301]  I have investigated the Russian Mafia.
[01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:03.122]  There is no Russian Mafia in the West.
[01:27:03.622 --> 01:27:04.763]  That's the point.
[01:27:04.763 --> 01:27:08.866]  But they have those films, one after another, one after another.
[01:27:08.866 --> 01:27:11.168]  Russian mafia, the killers, gangsters.
[01:27:11.168 --> 01:27:12.369]  They're all of America.
[01:27:12.369 --> 01:27:13.750]  They're threatening everyone.
[01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:14.731]  Excuse me.
[01:27:14.731 --> 01:27:19.755]  Most of the gangsters come from the Mexican part of the border, you know?
[01:27:19.755 --> 01:27:20.656]  Where are the Russians?
[01:27:20.656 --> 01:27:27.962]  But unfortunately, you know, from the early age, they watch the books, they watch those films, and that's how this
[01:27:28.482 --> 01:27:32.083]  This trust, this hatred for Russia is developing.
[01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:38.245]  And I think we should all tell our children, I've been telling my children, you know, don't trust those things.
[01:27:38.245 --> 01:27:39.765]  Don't trust those films.
[01:27:39.765 --> 01:27:40.665]  This is all rubbish.
[01:27:40.665 --> 01:27:41.926]  They're all pretending.
[01:27:41.926 --> 01:27:43.546]  This is not the truth.
[01:27:43.546 --> 01:27:45.587]  But Americans don't do that.
[01:27:45.587 --> 01:27:53.469]  And you produce some of the most, not you personally of course, but the American TV industry and Hollywood, some of the most disgusting,
[01:27:53.909 --> 01:28:00.032]  Well, that's why I said Hollywood, because it's not just the neoliberals, the neocons.
[01:28:00.032 --> 01:28:04.393]  The engine of the hate and the propaganda for it is Hollywood.
[01:28:04.393 --> 01:28:09.315]  And they're the same people demonizing Christians, conservatives, libertarians, rural communities.
[01:28:09.315 --> 01:28:14.157]  This is a conquering elite that sees any form of independence as the enemy.
[01:28:14.157 --> 01:28:22.681]  And now that Russia has pulled out of a place that Bernie Sanders would want to vacation, that's why Russia is now seen as the existential threat.
[01:28:23.857 --> 01:28:28.782]  Alex, the problem with America is that your conservative movement is very weak.
[01:28:28.782 --> 01:28:29.623]  It's very
[01:28:31.147 --> 01:28:33.849]  You know, it's weak.
[01:28:33.849 --> 01:28:41.932]  And you have demagogues pretending to be Republicans or Conservatives or Christians talking absolute rubbish.
[01:28:41.932 --> 01:28:44.293]  And people think they're Conservatives.
[01:28:44.293 --> 01:28:46.314]  There's a lot of problems, for example.
[01:28:46.314 --> 01:28:46.855]  No, I agree.
[01:28:46.855 --> 01:28:51.637]  I'm going to get your perspective, the Russian-slash-UK perspective, with us straight ahead.
[01:28:51.637 --> 01:28:52.117]  Stay with us.
[01:28:52.117 --> 01:28:56.139]  One more segment, and Roger Stone will give us the inside details on Mueller and the latest.
[01:28:58.806 --> 01:29:01.267]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[01:29:01.267 --> 01:29:03.128]  They may look the same on the outside.
[01:29:03.128 --> 01:29:03.869]  They're stylish.
[01:29:03.869 --> 01:29:05.530]  They'll hold your cards and cash.
[01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:08.511]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[01:29:08.511 --> 01:29:10.752]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[01:29:10.752 --> 01:29:13.134]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[01:29:13.134 --> 01:29:15.235]  But it does have magical powers.
[01:29:15.795 --> 01:29:21.477]  ID Stronghold wallets protect your critical information and identity from thieves standing right next to you.
[01:29:21.477 --> 01:29:26.979]  Anyone can buy a cheap RFID scanner online and snag your information just by walking past you.

[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.282]  ID Stronghold was the first to pioneer RFID blocking technology over 12 years ago.
[01:29:36.562 --> 01:29:40.207]  ID Stronghold's wallets, sleeves and badge holders are trusted by the U.S.
[01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:42.990]  Military and the Executive Office of the President.

[01:29:58.851 --> 01:30:01.874]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:30:01.874 --> 01:30:06.078]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:30:06.078 --> 01:30:12.764]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:30:12.764 --> 01:30:16.528]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:30:17.228 --> 01:30:36.742]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:30:37.282 --> 01:30:41.405]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:30:41.405 --> 01:30:52.653]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:30:52.653 --> 01:30:57.757]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:30:58.377 --> 01:30:59.297]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:30:59.297 --> 01:30:59.857]  Good, brother.

[01:31:01.798 --> 01:31:03.518]  Everything you said about them is correct.

[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.180]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.

[01:32:20.198 --> 01:32:21.339]  I don't feel good.
[01:32:21.339 --> 01:32:25.081]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:27.783]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:32:27.783 --> 01:32:33.587]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:32:33.587 --> 01:32:36.549]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:32:36.549 --> 01:32:40.071]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[01:32:40.071 --> 01:32:42.313]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:32:42.313 --> 01:32:42.673]  I love it.
[01:32:42.833 --> 01:32:45.636]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:32:45.636 --> 01:32:46.657]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:46.657 --> 01:32:52.624]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:52.624 --> 01:32:54.486]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:32:54.486 --> 01:33:01.053]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:33:01.053 --> 01:33:03.716]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.561]  By the way, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:33:17.561 --> 01:33:32.186]  When I tell you you get tomorrow's news today, we've told you it's pressure bombs, and he's using mousetraps, and he's using the green belts, and that's all starting to come out, and we told you that all these companies do this data mining that you heard about with this British company.
[01:33:32.186 --> 01:33:38.568]  This British company has hundreds of clients, liberal, conservative, African, European, all over the globe.
[01:33:39.873 --> 01:33:45.295]  And that Facebook and others were in deep trouble now that the media had finally reported on this?
[01:33:45.295 --> 01:33:47.896]  Because now it's going to implode the whole thing.
[01:33:47.896 --> 01:33:51.977]  Now their stock's down $40 billion and here's the Guardian.
[01:33:51.977 --> 01:33:52.918]  Utterly horrifying.
[01:33:52.918 --> 01:33:54.978]  Ex-Facebook employee insider.
[01:33:54.978 --> 01:33:56.799]  Covert data harvesting was routine.
[01:33:57.796 --> 01:34:11.465]  Yes, what they claim this pink-haired genius did was a standard data mine indexing the information, then using the original people they harvested to then create accounts and go out and reach out and create a community.
[01:34:11.465 --> 01:34:12.906]  That's what the left does.
[01:34:12.906 --> 01:34:15.388]  It's what Facebook and Twitter and YouTube is.
[01:34:15.388 --> 01:34:16.909]  Here's the former head of the Clinton campaign.
[01:34:16.909 --> 01:34:19.330]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:23.573]  Obama's former campaign director makes a bombshell claim.
[01:34:23.573 --> 01:34:24.734]  Facebook was on our side.
[01:34:26.147 --> 01:34:31.310]  I was saying Hillary earlier, there's another Hillary person saying the same thing, and it's just crazy.
[01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:41.937]  So, I'm not the tech guy, but I study what the top people say, and it's just crazy how they limitedly try to go after Trump.
[01:34:41.937 --> 01:34:53.365]  Okay, let's go back to Alexander Nekrasov, who's a journalist in the UK, and he has been a former Kremlin and government insider, and just in the few minutes we have left,
[01:34:54.295 --> 01:35:17.870]  I want to pragmatically then, he was getting back to what Russia was like 20 years ago or 15, 16 years ago and what it's like now and where he sees Russia going and any hopes or ways for the United States and Russia to be able to expose this neoliberalism for what it is, this globalism that's waging war against the nation state, against families, against Western civilization.
[01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:19.992]  I'm not putting words in his mouth, the globalists say
[01:35:20.692 --> 01:35:21.973]  They're against Western civilization.
[01:35:21.973 --> 01:35:23.293]  We can say Russia isn't really Western.
[01:35:23.293 --> 01:35:27.655]  Well, it really is Western, if you call Christian being Western.
[01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:32.697]  So Alexander, if you guys can send him the feed, thanks.
[01:35:32.697 --> 01:35:36.479]  Alexander, how can we hope to turn this around?
[01:35:36.479 --> 01:35:37.599]  Any other closing comments?
[01:35:37.599 --> 01:35:38.540]  I appreciate you coming on today.
[01:35:41.249 --> 01:35:42.430]  Right.
[01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:44.132]  I didn't hear the previous conversation.
[01:35:44.132 --> 01:35:47.416]  I'm sorry, I think somebody was talking to you.
[01:35:47.416 --> 01:35:51.080]  How do we short circuit this whole globalist operation?
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.704]  How do we somehow get people to realize this whole Russia thing really is a hoax?
[01:35:56.505 --> 01:36:06.573]  Well, it's going to be a tough one, because unfortunately, as I started saying, the liberal camp, the neoliberals, are so united.
[01:36:06.573 --> 01:36:08.695]  They are so tribal.
[01:36:08.695 --> 01:36:13.839]  And unfortunately, the conservatives in America, and the West generally, are so divided.
[01:36:14.339 --> 01:36:24.107]  There's so much confusion, there's so many demagogues who pretend to be conservatives, but actually drag the people completely in a different direction.
[01:36:24.107 --> 01:36:27.069]  So it will be a hell of a struggle to do this.
[01:36:27.069 --> 01:36:36.376]  And unfortunately, I must accept this as well, Alex, that Putin and his crowd sometimes do and say things that are not great.
[01:36:36.816 --> 01:36:40.379]  You know, as a public relations exercise, I would say.
[01:36:40.379 --> 01:36:47.004]  And I think there has to be more cooperation in the sense that I was a troubleshooter for the Kremlin.
[01:36:47.004 --> 01:36:49.686]  And my job was to fix things.
[01:36:49.686 --> 01:36:57.212]  My job was to go behind the scenes and basically resolve the problems before the big boys were meeting.
[01:36:57.212 --> 01:37:01.275]  We don't have those fixes anymore, like, you know, the troubleshooters.
[01:37:01.275 --> 01:37:03.877]  They need to be more, you know, involved in this.
[01:37:03.877 --> 01:37:05.619]  There need to be more people like that.
[01:37:06.079 --> 01:37:12.222]  Going back and forth between America and Russia, talking, you know, finding out solutions.
[01:37:12.222 --> 01:37:13.443]  I don't see that happening.
[01:37:13.443 --> 01:37:25.088]  I see those idiots from the State Department and those fools from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Russia telling all sorts of silly things, you know, to their leaders.
[01:37:25.088 --> 01:37:27.389]  And that's why I think there is a problem.
[01:37:27.389 --> 01:37:28.890]  It will take time.
[01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:31.831]  Unfortunately, it will take a lot of time.
[01:37:31.831 --> 01:37:33.332]  But I hope, I hope,
[01:37:33.732 --> 01:37:37.775]  That both Trump and Putin, they are strong people.
[01:37:37.775 --> 01:37:51.484]  You know, whatever people say about them, whatever, you know, the lies and so on, I think they're tough when it comes to negotiations, but they're also tough when you need a decision.
[01:37:51.484 --> 01:37:55.087]  And I'm hoping that together, they might crack it.
[01:37:55.087 --> 01:37:57.248]  But it will be a hell of a job.
[01:37:57.248 --> 01:37:58.810]  I mean, honestly.
[01:37:58.810 --> 01:38:01.772]  Alexander, why do you think, just as individuals,
[01:38:02.665 --> 01:38:09.369]  Why do you think the globalists, the leftists, the anti-family crowd, why do they hate Putin?
[01:38:09.369 --> 01:38:10.530]  Why do they hate Trump?
[01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:12.011]  Well, I've met them.
[01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:12.511]  I know them.
[01:38:12.511 --> 01:38:14.032]  They hate families.
[01:38:14.032 --> 01:38:15.393]  Almost none of them have children.
[01:38:15.393 --> 01:38:17.274]  They tell you they hate your children.
[01:38:17.274 --> 01:38:20.236]  I mean, they're just really nasty, demonic people.
[01:38:20.236 --> 01:38:26.020]  And I hate to boil it down to that, because I've been on air 23 years, and until the last five or so, that wasn't what I harped on.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:28.462]  But now, when you get down to final equations,
[01:38:29.608 --> 01:38:32.233]  These are just really, really bad people.
[01:38:32.233 --> 01:38:39.766]  Can you give your perspective on why the whole leftist global movement hates Russia, hates the United States, hates Putin, hates Trump?
[01:38:41.653 --> 01:38:45.754]  Well, I think you've mentioned that point correctly.
[01:38:45.754 --> 01:38:57.476]  I think, first of all, the values that Putin and Trump stand for, you know, God, Christianity, this they hate, because that's the thing they hate.
[01:38:57.476 --> 01:39:08.238]  And don't forget that the international globalists and neoliberals, I call them militant neoliberals, because they have gone over the top now, I think they hate
[01:39:09.159 --> 01:39:14.224]  Unlike the previous old days, you know, the Cold War, they hate the Russian people.
[01:39:14.224 --> 01:39:16.646]  Not just the leadership, but the Russian people.
[01:39:16.646 --> 01:39:18.708]  Big difference with the Cold War.
[01:39:18.708 --> 01:39:19.349]  Why?
[01:39:19.349 --> 01:39:23.753]  Because the Russian people do not accept their vile agendas.
[01:39:23.753 --> 01:39:25.455]  And they hate them for that.
[01:39:25.455 --> 01:39:27.457]  They just want to destroy them for that.
[01:39:27.457 --> 01:39:31.421]  Because they can't understand how somebody, you know, can't accept
[01:39:33.066 --> 01:39:43.014]  You see, the problem with a lot of Western people, they've been brought up to believe that political correctness is part of free speech and democracy.
[01:39:43.014 --> 01:39:48.358]  Political correctness is exactly the opposite of free speech and democracy.
[01:39:49.005 --> 01:39:54.153]  Further on, in your part of the world, people say liberal democracy.
[01:39:54.153 --> 01:39:56.056]  We have a liberal democracy.
[01:39:56.056 --> 01:40:01.505]  Well, excuse me, liberal democracy is a contradiction in terms.
[01:40:01.505 --> 01:40:03.929]  Liberalism has never been democratic.
[01:40:04.449 --> 01:40:10.231]  So even the name of those, you know, systems in the West is wrong.
[01:40:10.231 --> 01:40:12.312]  It is not liberal democracy.
[01:40:12.312 --> 01:40:23.857]  It is liberal autocracy that has taken grip over Europe and is trying to control America, but suddenly Trump came out of nowhere and they're terrified.
[01:40:23.857 --> 01:40:24.497]  They're running.
[01:40:24.497 --> 01:40:25.898]  They don't know what to do.
[01:40:25.898 --> 01:40:27.478]  They're making mistakes.
[01:40:27.478 --> 01:40:29.779]  They're actually clashing with each other.
[01:40:29.779 --> 01:40:33.941]  And that is why there is a chance still, but we have to unite.
[01:40:34.341 --> 01:40:55.659]  Conservatives of the world, I'm using like a Marxist lingo... No, we have to counter their internationalism as Christians and conservatives of every race, color, and creed, unified around free speech, around religious freedom, around free market, and around the international true brotherhood of humankind, and sisterhood, to counter their total tyranny.
[01:40:55.659 --> 01:40:56.340]  Because as you know,
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.163]  The proto-globalist helped set up the bullshit revolution.
[01:41:00.163 --> 01:41:03.286]  The liberal elements of the CIA helped put Mao into power.
[01:41:03.286 --> 01:41:04.407]  It's now all declassified.
[01:41:04.407 --> 01:41:06.990]  It all came out McCarthy was right.
[01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:14.697]  And so, from my research, not that czarism was good, it was all crumbling, I know about all that, and the white Russians corruption, and the czarists, and all of it, but you have...
[01:41:15.538 --> 01:41:21.242]  That being replaced with like this liberal playland of total social engineering and control.
[01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:25.946]  And so now they're just mad that their fantasy is falling apart in Russia.
[01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.507]  Now their fantasy is falling apart here.
[01:41:27.507 --> 01:41:28.628]  I think you're right.
[01:41:28.628 --> 01:41:32.451]  We have that shared enemy that is the deranged militant
[01:41:32.831 --> 01:41:33.512]  Anti-God.
[01:41:33.512 --> 01:41:35.094]  I mean, look at Russia under their control.
[01:41:35.094 --> 01:41:36.035]  Couldn't be Christian.
[01:41:36.035 --> 01:41:37.156]  Attacked families.
[01:41:37.156 --> 01:41:38.498]  Tried to push promiscuity.
[01:41:38.498 --> 01:41:39.799]  Tried to break the society down.
[01:41:39.799 --> 01:41:45.446]  But they couldn't get Russians to accept as much of it culturally as they've got us to do.
[01:41:45.446 --> 01:41:47.689]  And they've almost got us right to the tipping point.
[01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:48.590]  Right where they wanted us.
[01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:50.372]  And like you said, here comes Trump.
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:58.667]  But one thing I want to point out, Alex, which is I think very important, when you mentioned the free market.
[01:41:58.667 --> 01:42:02.030]  Unfortunately, the free market has been disappearing.
[01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:04.433]  We now have a virtual economy.
[01:42:04.433 --> 01:42:08.737]  The rule of the financial markets, they're going against us.
[01:42:08.737 --> 01:42:10.519]  They're going against the economy.
[01:42:10.879 --> 01:42:14.881]  Global mega crony capitalist system waging war against the nation state in real markets.
[01:42:14.881 --> 01:42:17.423]  We got to have you back Alexander Nekrasov.
[01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:18.063]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:18.063 --> 01:42:21.725]  People can follow you at Twitter at Stirring Trouble with two R's.
[01:42:21.725 --> 01:42:23.066]  Stirring Trouble, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:23.066 --> 01:42:24.587]  Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[01:42:24.587 --> 01:42:26.048]  Paul Watson at Prison Planet.
[01:42:26.048 --> 01:42:28.990]  And be sure and continue to spread our articles on Facebook, YouTube, Google.
[01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:30.070]  All of them are trying to stop us.
[01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.971]  Thank you so much for the time sir.
[01:42:31.852 --> 01:42:32.673]  Thank you.
[01:42:32.673 --> 01:42:38.838]  I'm getting accused of being run by Russians, so I thought I'd get a former Kremlin official on so we can actually start talking to them since they're my boss.
[01:42:38.838 --> 01:42:40.399]  I didn't know that.
[01:42:40.399 --> 01:42:44.863]  But Roger Stone, we got him coming on.
[01:42:44.863 --> 01:42:46.204]  They say he works for the Russians, too.
[01:42:46.204 --> 01:42:49.527]  He gave us the latest on Mueller and so much more.
[01:42:49.527 --> 01:42:55.371]  And then we have the man facing six months in prison for saying he didn't like Hitler, but then doing a Hitler dog joke.
[01:42:55.371 --> 01:42:55.772]  That's right.

[01:43:58.701 --> 01:44:08.844]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:08.844 --> 01:44:14.346]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:14.346 --> 01:44:17.347]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:17.347 --> 01:44:26.130]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:33.522]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:33.522 --> 01:44:38.484]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:38.484 --> 01:44:47.828]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.

[01:47:25.823 --> 01:47:29.245]  Former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:47:29.245 --> 01:47:33.427]  That's right, we are crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:47:33.427 --> 01:47:40.970]  Yeah, you know guys, when you hear me and I come in and I start talking over the liner, just slap that sucker down.
[01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:43.051]  Just cut that mother off.
[01:47:43.051 --> 01:47:48.553]  You hear me start talking, you know a liner's coming, just, that's the standard setting, just blammo.
[01:47:49.361 --> 01:47:51.462]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:47:51.462 --> 01:47:56.784]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:47:56.784 --> 01:48:02.406]  And we are under massive globalist attack because we are over the target.
[01:48:02.406 --> 01:48:03.846]  We are in the fight.
[01:48:03.846 --> 01:48:05.387]  We are in the thick of it.
[01:48:05.387 --> 01:48:10.529]  We are at the heart of the epicenter of the battle for the future.
[01:48:10.529 --> 01:48:11.469]  And Roger Stone,
[01:48:13.376 --> 01:48:20.900]  I wanted to get him on because he has predicted this all very, very accurately, that the Trump lawyers were told, oh, it'll be over by November.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.540]  It'll be over by December.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.961]  We know you're not implicated.
[01:48:23.961 --> 01:48:26.122]  We know there's no evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:48:26.122 --> 01:48:29.924]  They're not going to go out into other things or other companies or other groups, just the Russians.
[01:48:29.924 --> 01:48:38.648]  And then now Trump has been told, no, it's going to go on forever, and it deals with you personally, and it deals with European companies and U.S.
[01:48:38.648 --> 01:48:41.430]  companies and your employees, and it's never going to end.
[01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:47.994]  And Trump knows that Mueller was involved, covering up for Hillary, covering up for all the crimes.
[01:48:47.994 --> 01:49:05.545]  Comey's been caught leaking, lying to Congress, McCabe's been caught, and now he's sitting there looking at this, and CNN, I have the headline right here, says that the fate of Trump is in the hands of Mueller, and that Mueller has him cornered.
[01:49:05.545 --> 01:49:07.186]  And when you know about the three branches of government,
[01:49:08.103 --> 01:49:19.511]  And you know about, this is under the executive, this is a rogue group that's been caught being political and being caught making up intelligence and being caught illegally spying, that the whole thing has to get shut down and Mueller has to get indicted.
[01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:21.732]  That's the default.
[01:49:21.732 --> 01:49:22.413]  But instead,
[01:49:23.752 --> 01:49:28.093]  The media pushes this like Mueller is God, the fourth branch of government.
[01:49:28.093 --> 01:49:29.893]  Well, who oversees him?
[01:49:29.893 --> 01:49:32.534]  You see, the President's fate is not in the hands of Mueller.
[01:49:32.534 --> 01:49:33.834]  It's in the hands of the American people.
[01:49:33.834 --> 01:49:36.055]  He has to be impeached.
[01:49:36.055 --> 01:49:38.795]  That's why the Democrats want to get control of the House.
[01:49:38.795 --> 01:49:40.616]  We have to buy into their bull.
[01:49:40.616 --> 01:49:45.697]  So they're selling the idea that if Mueller indicts him for some process thing, not Russian-related,
[01:49:46.477 --> 01:49:47.498]  That he has to go.
[01:49:47.498 --> 01:49:49.239]  That's the big hoax now.
[01:49:49.239 --> 01:49:52.241]  We know Russiagate's a hoax, but Mueller is a hoax.
[01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:54.243]  So they're now pushing that, ooh, he's got him.
[01:49:54.243 --> 01:49:56.285]  It's like Darth Vader with Luke Skywalker.
[01:49:56.285 --> 01:49:57.325]  I have you now.
[01:49:57.325 --> 01:49:58.866]  So where are we really, Roger?
[01:49:58.866 --> 01:50:00.308]  Because you've laid all this out.
[01:50:00.308 --> 01:50:01.228]  You've warned the president.
[01:50:01.228 --> 01:50:05.672]  You said early on when the president was really strong, he's even probably stronger now, just get rid of Mueller.
[01:50:05.672 --> 01:50:06.672]  He's a fraud.
[01:50:06.672 --> 01:50:08.294]  Start indicting McCabe and all of them.
[01:50:08.294 --> 01:50:10.355]  The word is those indictments are being looked at.
[01:50:10.355 --> 01:50:11.016]  It's open and shut.
[01:50:11.556 --> 01:50:12.517]  So what's the answer?
[01:50:12.517 --> 01:50:18.942]  Super offensive, indict all these people that are open and shut, go after Hillary, and then Mueller just falls away?
[01:50:18.942 --> 01:50:25.107]  Or just let Mueller go on forever just looking for a crooked toenail somewhere, Roger?
[01:50:25.107 --> 01:50:36.456]  Well, Alex, first of all, I think the President's decision to add Joe DiGenova to his legal team shows a new combativeness and maybe a new awareness on the part of the President.
[01:50:37.319 --> 01:50:43.522]  Joe DeGeneva is not some weak-kneed, Ivy League, white-shoe lawyer.
[01:50:43.522 --> 01:50:45.583]  He's a street brawler.
[01:50:45.583 --> 01:50:52.207]  And he understands that this isn't really a legal proceeding so much as a political proceeding.
[01:50:52.207 --> 01:51:00.331]  Now, as you know, the special counsel law under which Mueller would normally be operating has expired.
[01:51:00.991 --> 01:51:09.014]  Therefore, Mr. Mueller has no checks or restraints on what he can do and where he can go.
[01:51:09.014 --> 01:51:20.877]  Under the previous special counsel law, he would have had to go on to a three-judge panel for any expansion of his inquiry into an area broader than Russian collusion.
[01:51:20.877 --> 01:51:23.758]  So he is Lord High Protector at this point?
[01:51:23.758 --> 01:51:26.219]  He is just his own branch of government running around?
[01:51:27.466 --> 01:51:44.931]  Well, interestingly enough, and I think this is a very key point, even though there's no statutory requirement for him to do so, he has gone to Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, and had him approve every single step of his path towards removing the President.
[01:51:45.371 --> 01:51:49.913]  The expansion, the Manafort indictments, the Flynn indictment.
[01:51:49.913 --> 01:52:00.376]  Mr. Rosenstein approved all of this, attempting to give Mueller the mantle of some kind of Justice Department cover in his efforts.
[01:52:00.376 --> 01:52:13.400]  That and that alone, or that, added to the fact that Rosenstein also approved the use of the phony dossier to put the Trump campaign under surveillance, in my opinion,
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.001]  Absolutely!
[01:52:15.001 --> 01:52:17.443]  Isn't he just another ringleader like McCabe?
[01:52:17.443 --> 01:52:19.104]  He's the one that launched the whole witch hunt!
[01:52:31.128 --> 01:52:32.329]  Exactly right.
[01:52:32.329 --> 01:52:44.256]  And therefore I think in the event that you terminated Mueller, the decision to fire him, the order to fire him, would go to Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:52:44.256 --> 01:52:45.576]  Would he carry out that order?
[01:52:45.576 --> 01:52:47.137]  So that's a feedback loop.
[01:52:47.137 --> 01:52:51.119]  So it should fall to the Inspector General, it should fall to the President.
[01:52:51.119 --> 01:52:52.900]  It's actually worse than that.
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:57.043]  Rosenstein and Mueller did something very clever.
[01:52:58.103 --> 01:52:59.564]  Or at least Rosenstein did.
[01:52:59.564 --> 01:53:17.237]  Early in the Trump administration, they got the president to sign a change that changes the order of authority at the Justice Department from the Attorney General, Sessions, to Rosenstein, to the woman who retired recently, who was the number three person in the department.
[01:53:17.237 --> 01:53:19.158]  And then it doesn't go to the Solicitor General.
[01:53:19.158 --> 01:53:20.119]  It goes to the U.S.
[01:53:20.119 --> 01:53:22.201]  Attorney in Texas, and then a U.S.
[01:53:22.201 --> 01:53:25.343]  Attorney in North Carolina, both Bush loyalists.
[01:53:25.843 --> 01:53:31.529]  So they're trying to rig the House just in case Donald Trump fires Mr. Mueller.
[01:53:31.529 --> 01:53:34.312]  I would not urge him to fire Mueller at this point.
[01:53:34.312 --> 01:53:41.639]  I would demand that a special prosecutor be appointed or the Justice Department can do this without Mueller.
[01:53:45.512 --> 01:53:56.111]  Look at Mueller's involvement in Uranium One, and specifically the trip that he took to Russia in 2009, carrying uranium samples for Hillary and Bill Clinton.
[01:53:57.466 --> 01:53:58.867]  Exactly.
[01:53:58.867 --> 01:54:05.071]  Imagine if we had Trump on a tarmac with secret rendezvous with Uranium or Loretta Lynch in secret meetings with Bill Clinton.
[01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:06.952]  We have these crooks.
[01:54:06.952 --> 01:54:08.133]  That's why they're so desperate.
[01:54:08.133 --> 01:54:09.814]  They're never going to give up.
[01:54:09.814 --> 01:54:11.595]  And notice CNN and others always change the subject.
[01:54:11.595 --> 01:54:15.858]  Every time he goes, this is corrupt, this person is corrupt, and Trump's right, they change the subject.
[01:54:15.858 --> 01:54:17.279]  Don't fire Mueller, you'll get in trouble.
[01:54:18.246 --> 01:54:21.308]  Instead, we leave him out there flapping, flapping in the wind.
[01:54:21.308 --> 01:54:28.571]  But at a certain point, Trump has a responsibility, and Attorney General Sessions does, to start firing all these people for the open crimes they've committed.
[01:54:28.571 --> 01:54:32.113]  I mean, I get it makes it look bad, but it's still what you need to do.
[01:54:32.113 --> 01:54:38.916]  I mean, you know, if Mueller's running around setting fires to people's houses at night, he's still got to arrest him.
[01:54:38.916 --> 01:54:40.197]  I mean, it doesn't matter how it looks.
[01:54:41.501 --> 01:54:43.102]  I could not agree more.
[01:54:43.102 --> 01:54:49.444]  The problem, of course, is the President's made his desires perfectly clear, including through his Twitter feed.
[01:54:49.444 --> 01:54:51.925]  But Jeff Sessions isn't getting the message.
[01:54:51.925 --> 01:55:05.049]  The video footage of Sessions dining with Rosenstein in downtown Washington, toasting each other, was open contempt of the President of the United States.
[01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:09.175]  So what is the best thinking on Sessions?
[01:55:09.175 --> 01:55:12.300]  What in the world is going on with this guy?
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:13.201]  It's very simple.
[01:55:13.201 --> 01:55:20.813]  The president's chief advisors have convinced the president that he cannot get away with firing Sessions, that he would face impeachment.
[01:55:21.517 --> 01:55:22.858]  I don't think so.
[01:55:22.858 --> 01:55:28.503]  The President's leverage gets stronger and stronger as the economy rebounds.
[01:55:28.503 --> 01:55:42.295]  If he emerges from the Korean peace talks with any kind of accomplishment, say the denuclearization of North Korea, he will have enormous leverage to put this thing away once and for all.
[01:55:42.315 --> 01:55:53.421]  No, I agree, but I mean, why would Sessions be toasting with Rosenstein and then having public events where he says he's the best ever, when Rosenstein is a clear little Clinton creature?
[01:55:53.421 --> 01:56:02.747]  A congressman who's a friend of mine had an extensive meeting with Jeff Sessions and he came away saying, the man is dottering.
[01:56:03.473 --> 01:56:05.635]  That he is, that he's around the bend.
[01:56:05.635 --> 01:56:09.938]  That he is no longer well enough to have a clear thought.
[01:56:09.938 --> 01:56:12.560]  Oh, so he's had a mini-stroke or something?
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:13.021]  Something.
[01:56:13.021 --> 01:56:15.202]  All he does is rage about marijuana.
[01:56:15.202 --> 01:56:17.204]  Arresting all those people on marijuana.
[01:56:17.204 --> 01:56:21.708]  Which is one of the worst things ever for Trump, because it just turns everybody off.
[01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:26.952]  I mean, it absolutely, I mean Sessions, Sessions is, his expiration date is over.
[01:56:26.952 --> 01:56:28.213]  He needs to be put out to pasture.
[01:56:29.033 --> 01:56:42.786]  In a poll by Trump's pollster, which we broke on The War Room, some 69% of Trump supporters, 68% of Republicans, are for state legalized medicinal marijuana.
[01:56:42.786 --> 01:56:48.551]  And the number of people who believe the states should decide, despite their own personal views, is in the 80s.
[01:56:49.712 --> 01:56:58.036]  This is a silent third rail that would just shear off libertarian and conservative-oriented pro-Trump.
[01:56:58.036 --> 01:56:58.757]  All right, stay there.
[01:56:58.757 --> 01:57:00.598]  I want to come back and briefly ask you, Roger.
[01:57:02.150 --> 01:57:06.314]  What their next moves are going to be, because you've been accurately breaking all that down.
[01:57:06.314 --> 01:57:07.495]  We'll do five more minutes with you.
[01:57:07.495 --> 01:57:10.538]  How the globals are going to try to derail the economy.
[01:57:10.538 --> 01:57:12.860]  There's this Russia summit now being announced.
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:17.404]  I guess they'll meet in Riykjavik or something, a la Reagan and Gorbachev.
[01:57:17.404 --> 01:57:18.445]  And any other big tidbits.
[01:57:18.445 --> 01:57:19.546]  I know we're going to talk unfair today.
[01:57:19.546 --> 01:57:23.630]  We've got some other big stuff that's going to be breaking in the next few days.
[01:57:23.630 --> 01:57:24.551]  Roger Stone joins us.
[01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:27.733]  I'm Alex Jones in the ATX.
[01:57:27.733 --> 01:57:30.096]  A fifth bomb went off this morning at a FedEx Center.
[01:57:30.096 --> 01:57:31.797]  They've given people exclusive details on that.
[01:57:31.797 --> 01:57:33.719]  These are mousetrap bombs.
[01:57:33.719 --> 01:57:34.660]  I'll explain that.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:35.782]  It's all coming up.
[01:57:35.782 --> 01:57:37.884]  Third and fourth hours straight ahead.
[01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:38.905]  So much more.
[01:57:38.905 --> 01:57:40.767]  Tomorrow's news today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:47.409 --> 01:57:51.013]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:57:51.013 --> 01:57:52.775]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:57:52.775 --> 01:58:04.066]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:58:04.827 --> 01:58:14.013]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:58:14.013 --> 01:58:25.079]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:58:25.079 --> 01:58:27.701]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:29.402]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:58:29.402 --> 01:58:34.185]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:58:34.445 --> 01:58:39.394]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:58:39.394 --> 01:58:42.038]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:58:42.038 --> 01:58:46.766]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:58:48.348 --> 01:58:51.149]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[01:58:51.149 --> 01:59:01.615]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[01:59:01.615 --> 01:59:02.395]  Scalability.
[01:59:02.395 --> 01:59:04.736]  But now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[01:59:04.736 --> 01:59:06.397]  So there's a lot of product and a lot
[01:59:10.299 --> 01:59:10.639]  I don't know.
[01:59:25.972 --> 01:59:31.755]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[01:59:31.755 --> 01:59:38.198]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[01:59:38.198 --> 01:59:41.019]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[01:59:41.019 --> 01:59:51.623]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[01:59:51.623 --> 01:59:54.265]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.344 --> 02:00:11.187]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:11.187 --> 02:00:14.190]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.190 --> 02:00:20.274]  I wanted to ask Roger Stone this question.
[02:00:20.274 --> 02:00:24.056]  Just historically, imagine we're looking back 20 years from now.
[02:00:24.056 --> 02:00:25.557]  What is this period in history?
[02:00:25.557 --> 02:00:26.878]  The rebirth of nationalism?
[02:00:26.878 --> 02:00:27.739]  The rebirth of free market?
[02:00:27.739 --> 02:00:29.140]  The rebirth of populism?
[02:00:31.178 --> 02:00:32.298]  And how can you turn away?
[02:00:32.298 --> 02:00:33.539]  It's so entertaining.
[02:00:33.539 --> 02:00:35.179]  It's so exciting.
[02:00:35.179 --> 02:00:36.539]  And then you realize it's real.
[02:00:36.539 --> 02:00:45.701]  Real globalists, real socialists, real authoritarians, shutting down free speech, top globalists suing us, stuff we haven't even announced yet happening to Roger.
[02:00:45.701 --> 02:00:51.903]  I mean, it's like we're the Americans fighting the globalists and we're targeted.
[02:00:51.903 --> 02:00:56.784]  Trump, Stone, myself, a few others, you the audience backing us and they're so pissed you're there backing us.
[02:00:57.662 --> 02:01:01.265]  And they're doing everything they can to turn down our reach and everything else, but it's not working because of you.
[02:01:01.265 --> 02:01:04.127]  So, thank God you're out there, folks, and you realize the fight we're in.
[02:01:04.127 --> 02:01:06.649]  Roger, how would you describe the time we're in right now?
[02:01:06.649 --> 02:01:12.994]  And I know you're going to be joining us tomorrow with a bunch of big, breaking, exclusive news, but I just hope people realize this is history happening.
[02:01:12.994 --> 02:01:13.995]  This isn't Netflix.
[02:01:13.995 --> 02:01:15.276]  This isn't HBO.
[02:01:15.276 --> 02:01:16.177]  This isn't fiction.
[02:01:16.177 --> 02:01:18.058]  This is real.
[02:01:18.058 --> 02:01:24.143]  You know, Alex, I was speaking to Dr. Jerry Corsi about this this morning, and he really summed it up in a very brief phrase.
[02:01:25.363 --> 02:01:29.005]  America was saved in the 2016 election.
[02:01:29.005 --> 02:01:38.028]  Out of nowhere, most improbably, an outsider comes who's not beholden to the globalists and the two-party neocons that have destroyed the country.
[02:01:38.028 --> 02:01:40.949]  And now we are in the midst of a coup d'etat.
[02:01:41.554 --> 02:01:47.796]  They intend to illegally, unconstitutionally undo the results of the last election.
[02:01:47.796 --> 02:02:08.562]  And they will resort to every trick in the book, whether it is lawfare to silence the supporters of Donald Trump and reform, or whether it is phony lawsuits that are designed to bankrupt us, whether it is the manipulation of social media to limit our ability to reach other patriots and tell them what's going on,
[02:02:09.442 --> 02:02:22.052]  Or whether it is a corrupted legal process in which a special prosecutor who has no constraints on him, not constrained by the Congress, by the Justice Department.
[02:02:22.052 --> 02:02:31.980]  I mean, Andrew McCarthy wrote an excellent piece on this in the National Review this week, where I think there are fundamental questions not to putting aside the conflict.
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:34.842]  This is rogue government constitutional crisis stuff.
[02:02:35.694 --> 02:02:36.695]  There's no question.
[02:02:36.695 --> 02:02:39.737]  There's a planned coup d'etat.
[02:02:39.737 --> 02:02:40.677]  And it's in the works.
[02:02:40.677 --> 02:02:46.521]  But a key element to the success of the coup d'etat is to silence Alex Jones.
[02:02:46.521 --> 02:02:48.082]  To silence Roger Stone.
[02:02:48.082 --> 02:02:48.662]  To silence...
[02:02:51.144 --> 02:02:53.667]  Everybody else down when they're done, they've announced it.
[02:02:53.667 --> 02:02:55.569]  That's why we've got to raise the alarm.
[02:02:55.569 --> 02:02:56.870]  And we're so close to the problem.
[02:02:56.870 --> 02:03:00.554]  We don't tend to get how sensational this is for everybody's future.
[02:03:00.554 --> 02:03:01.756]  They mean business.
[02:03:01.756 --> 02:03:03.498]  They know the genie's out of the bottle.
[02:03:03.498 --> 02:03:06.020]  The only thing they've got is total authoritarianism.
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:07.222]  And good luck.
[02:03:07.222 --> 02:03:08.924]  I don't think the dog's going to hunt, Roger.
[02:03:10.066 --> 02:03:19.270]  Well, the irony of this is those pundits who say Mueller's got Trump cornered now, they misunderstand how much power the president has.
[02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:27.233]  In fact, in all truth, Alex, sometimes I wonder whether the president understands fully how much power he has to change the course of government.
[02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:28.093]  That's right, and this is critical.
[02:03:28.413 --> 02:03:32.297]  He's letting the mainstream media do one thing that they're having some success.
[02:03:32.297 --> 02:03:38.303]  Create a false narrative about the separation of powers, unitary executive, co-equal, all the Supreme Court rulings.
[02:03:38.303 --> 02:03:43.248]  Like when he says you can't bring in people with fake passports from terror nations, they go, he can't do that.
[02:03:43.248 --> 02:03:48.433]  When the federal law is 100% the Constitution, Supreme Court 9-0 killed those courts.
[02:03:48.433 --> 02:03:49.934]  The media says he's overriding the courts.
[02:03:49.934 --> 02:03:52.116]  No, the court, the real court, certified it.
[02:03:52.777 --> 02:03:53.718]  It's the same thing.
[02:03:53.718 --> 02:03:58.842]  They keep acting like if he chooses what's on the menu at the White House, he's a dictator.
[02:03:58.842 --> 02:04:02.204]  And that somehow it's bad if he controls the executive and cleans house.
[02:04:02.204 --> 02:04:07.709]  If anything, he's in dereliction of duty letting this Clinton cabal run wild at the Justice Department.
[02:04:07.709 --> 02:04:09.230]  He needs to move on their ass.
[02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:12.493]  And I mean, like they're calling for extra judicial?
[02:04:12.493 --> 02:04:13.513]  That's illegal.
[02:04:13.513 --> 02:04:16.796]  Once they call, the president can do that with covert action.
[02:04:16.796 --> 02:04:17.977]  And that's the best thing for the country.
[02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:31.698]  Well, you know, it's amazing to see the mainstream media try to put the best possible face on their efforts to re-inflate the Russian collusion fraud.
[02:04:31.698 --> 02:04:46.267]  They're really at this point, I think, just swatting at flies, but never underestimate the deep enmity of the political insiders in Washington for this president or their resolve to remove him one way or another.
[02:04:48.413 --> 02:04:50.596]  Roger, since you bring this up, do five more minutes with us.
[02:04:50.596 --> 02:04:52.278]  I want to come back in 60 seconds and get into this.
[02:04:52.278 --> 02:04:56.965]  When I talk about covert action, everybody knows I don't shoot my mouth off.
[02:04:56.965 --> 02:04:59.308]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:04:59.308 --> 02:05:01.471]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:04.294]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:05:05.385 --> 02:05:16.890]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.

[02:05:42.973 --> 02:05:46.274]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:05:46.274 --> 02:05:48.295]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:05:48.295 --> 02:05:51.596]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:05:51.596 --> 02:05:54.137]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[02:05:54.137 --> 02:06:01.559]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[02:06:01.559 --> 02:06:05.721]  Big Brother.
[02:06:05.721 --> 02:06:08.762]  Mainstream Media.
[02:06:08.762 --> 02:06:09.842]  Government Cover-Ups.
[02:06:11.349 --> 02:06:13.231]  You want answers?
[02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:15.172]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:15.172 --> 02:06:23.458]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.458 --> 02:06:25.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, in fact, queue it up.
[02:06:27.330 --> 02:06:34.151]  A congressman, we'll put the article on screen, called for the second amendment to be used against the president this weekend.
[02:06:34.151 --> 02:06:37.112]  Another congressman went on and said, let's just take him out.
[02:06:37.112 --> 02:06:39.272]  Phil Mudd said, we're going to kill him.
[02:06:39.272 --> 02:06:44.513]  Schumer said, we got seven ways this Sunday to make you pay the intelligence agencies.
[02:06:44.513 --> 02:06:51.275]  The New York Times advertises, here's where they play baseball in the conservative libertarian caucus, in the Freedom Caucus.
[02:06:51.275 --> 02:06:52.575]  Boy, somebody could attack there.
[02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:59.212]  They're all over the news saying, kill everybody, kill me, kill Roger Stone, kill, kill, kill.
[02:06:59.212 --> 02:07:01.213]  They've whipped the country up into this.
[02:07:01.213 --> 02:07:03.234]  That's illegal.
[02:07:03.234 --> 02:07:09.657]  And the president's sitting there trying to turn the economy back on, proving we were artificially restrained, which I told you.
[02:07:09.657 --> 02:07:10.577]  It's a fact.
[02:07:10.577 --> 02:07:11.478]  That's what globalism is.
[02:07:11.478 --> 02:07:13.619]  They write white papers how they got their foot on our neck.
[02:07:14.286 --> 02:07:15.887]  And then they're everywhere saying, kill the president.
[02:07:15.887 --> 02:07:17.628]  They're everywhere saying they're going to overthrow the election.
[02:07:17.628 --> 02:07:19.429]  They're stealing elections in Pennsylvania.
[02:07:19.429 --> 02:07:20.750]  And they're stealing elections.
[02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:22.551]  And it doesn't matter whether they had a better candidate.
[02:07:22.551 --> 02:07:26.052]  It doesn't matter if they had a better candidate, you know, than Roy Moore or whatever.
[02:07:26.052 --> 02:07:27.013]  They stole those.
[02:07:27.013 --> 02:07:29.634]  There was total evidence in both.
[02:07:29.634 --> 02:07:32.076]  And the Republicans just roll over to it.
[02:07:32.076 --> 02:07:35.738]  And they're running around saying they're going to end the First Amendment once they take over.
[02:07:35.738 --> 02:07:40.801]  And they've got Obama's law firm suing him, two of Hillary's law firms suing me.
[02:07:40.801 --> 02:07:42.461]  And these people mean business.
[02:07:42.461 --> 02:07:43.062]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:07:44.926 --> 02:07:54.720]  When people start saying, we're going to go kill the President, or let's use the Second Amendment on him, we'll get that clip up in that article up in a minute, we're going to play it.
[02:07:56.584 --> 02:08:08.113]  When that type of stuff's going on, if somebody comes up to you and says, I've got a gun pointed at you, and it's really just their finger and their pants, you've got a right to blow them away.
[02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:14.739]  But if somebody's a congressman or a former head of CIA assassination operations like Mudd, he didn't ever kill anybody himself, but he was over it.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:16.541]  Because the globalists are cowards.
[02:08:16.541 --> 02:08:17.361]  They put little weasels.
[02:08:17.361 --> 02:08:19.943]  There's always a super wimp over the real killers.
[02:08:19.943 --> 02:08:27.207]  And they're always real scared of the super killers and keep them down and, you know, set them up for special regimens of vaccines to brain damage them after they've done the killing.
[02:08:27.207 --> 02:08:29.329]  But I'm educating all the killers.
[02:08:29.329 --> 02:08:30.249]  Don't worry.
[02:08:30.249 --> 02:08:31.370]  So, that's right.
[02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:33.892]  So what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, the killers are with us.
[02:08:33.892 --> 02:08:35.493]  The Americans are with us, by the way.
[02:08:35.493 --> 02:08:38.715]  And so what all these chicken necks need to understand is this.
[02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:44.393]  We know what you're doing with all your violence and all your talk of violence and all your organizing for it.
[02:08:44.393 --> 02:08:47.795]  So you keep reaping what you sow.
[02:08:47.795 --> 02:08:50.797]  You sow war, you're gonna get big time war.
[02:08:50.797 --> 02:08:52.158]  And you're gonna get the whirlwind.
[02:08:52.158 --> 02:08:55.000]  So, I'm not planning any violence myself.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:55.280]  Okay?
[02:08:56.368 --> 02:08:57.389]  I'm in the information war.
[02:08:57.389 --> 02:08:59.810]  We're having a big effect, but I'm not scared of your threats.
[02:08:59.810 --> 02:09:09.955]  And the President and the people around him and the folks that understand the Constitution and where we are, we're dealing with globalist operatives, outside powers, enemy combatants trying to overthrow our reboot.
[02:09:09.955 --> 02:09:11.696]  They're all in the payroll of the Communist Chinese.
[02:09:11.696 --> 02:09:12.956]  They're our only funding group.
[02:09:12.956 --> 02:09:14.937]  Trump's cut off Saudi Arabia.
[02:09:14.937 --> 02:09:17.038]  He's cutting off Soros.
[02:09:17.038 --> 02:09:20.540]  And so I know the President knows what he's doing, but he's kicking the moles out.
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:22.141]  Big positive news to get the moles out.
[02:09:23.777 --> 02:09:26.718]  All I'm saying is, you look at all this and the big push.
[02:09:26.718 --> 02:09:34.262]  We're dealing with outside authoritarian powers, organizing violence, carrying out violence, and now trying to get their constituents to be violent.
[02:09:34.262 --> 02:09:42.965]  And we have a right and a duty and responsibility to start public discussions of what we're going to do about it, if this escalates even a notch more.
[02:09:42.965 --> 02:09:45.206]  And you can't do it once they go into full attack mode.
[02:09:45.206 --> 02:09:48.247]  You've got to have pre-plans, triggers laid.
[02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:48.848]  Dead switches.
[02:09:49.528 --> 02:09:51.009]  Dead man switches.
[02:09:51.009 --> 02:10:02.356]  And so, it's time, I'm raising the alarm, it's time to have serious discussions, because we don't expect to deal with something like this, especially a bunch of leftists who are cowards and weaklings and don't even have a good command and control.
[02:10:02.356 --> 02:10:04.357]  But it's still dangerous.
[02:10:04.357 --> 02:10:09.260]  And so they're trying to politically isolate, bankrupt us, demonize us, ahead of killing us.
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:11.921]  And so, here's the deal.
[02:10:11.921 --> 02:10:13.762]  Whatever happens to me, that's going to be alright.
[02:10:13.762 --> 02:10:15.563]  Just so long as they in the end get it.
[02:10:15.563 --> 02:10:16.184]  Now, Roger Stone.
[02:10:17.162 --> 02:10:20.547]  I want to go to Roger Stone and in the next five minutes we'll go to our next guest.
[02:10:20.547 --> 02:10:22.891]  When I talk about covert action, not us.
[02:10:22.891 --> 02:10:24.773]  But we have a clear and present danger.
[02:10:24.773 --> 02:10:26.115]  We have an outside power.
[02:10:26.115 --> 02:10:28.499]  We have the globalists pushing all this.
[02:10:28.499 --> 02:10:29.621]  What should we do?
[02:10:29.621 --> 02:10:30.963]  What should the president be doing right now?
[02:10:32.478 --> 02:10:54.193]  Well, the single most important thing I think he can do to set the table, Alex, would be to order his assistant attorney general for antitrust to bust up the tech left attempts to strangle InfoWars and Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich and Milo and Steven Crowder and so on.
[02:10:54.193 --> 02:10:56.494]  I mean, I just want to say this again.
[02:10:56.494 --> 02:11:02.138]  A precursor to their entire insidious coup d'etat plan.
[02:11:02.896 --> 02:11:05.817]  It has two precursor steps.
[02:11:05.817 --> 02:11:08.999]  One, silence the advocates of freedom.
[02:11:08.999 --> 02:11:11.180]  Silence those who would defend Trump.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:14.841]  Number two, take away our guns.
[02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:16.302]  That's the plan.
[02:11:16.302 --> 02:11:20.784]  That way the removal of Donald Trump can go peacefully.
[02:11:20.784 --> 02:11:29.768]  So the most important thing he can do is wake up to the fact that whether or not Jared Kushner has a pleasant dinner with the Google executives is immaterial.
[02:11:30.388 --> 02:11:43.228]  The President's supporters are being censored, are having their heads chopped off every single day on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google, on YouTube.
[02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:45.312]  And this really must stop.
[02:11:46.411 --> 02:11:50.733]  That's right, let's put the article on screen from Infowars.com from Sunday if people want to see it.
[02:11:50.733 --> 02:11:58.397]  Dem Congressman uses 2nd Amendment to resist Trump, and he's sitting there talking to a town hall of your radio listener, Tom Suozzi.
[02:11:58.397 --> 02:11:59.998]  It's Tom Suozzi.
[02:11:59.998 --> 02:12:01.119]  Suozzi.
[02:12:01.119 --> 02:12:03.320]  Yeah, makes bizarre statement.
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.181]  Let's play that clip and then get your take on it.
[02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:05.981]  Roger Stone, here it is.
[02:12:05.981 --> 02:12:15.366]  It's a matter of putting public pressure on the president and making it public, which is hard to break through the news cycle and all the different things.
[02:12:16.110 --> 02:12:19.813]  And it's probably about going to the courts as well.
[02:12:19.813 --> 02:12:30.361]  And then, you know, I mean, this is where the Second Amendment comes in, quite frankly, because, you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts?
[02:12:30.361 --> 02:12:31.541]  What would you do?
[02:12:31.541 --> 02:12:35.124]  What would we do?
[02:12:35.124 --> 02:12:38.887]  So the First Amendment is the right to bear arms.
[02:12:38.887 --> 02:12:39.607]  That's why we have it.
[02:12:45.049 --> 02:12:49.911]  I mean, look at these helpless-looking idiots and this moron trying to organize people.
[02:12:49.911 --> 02:12:51.011]  Hey, we need to use the Second Amendment.
[02:12:51.011 --> 02:12:52.891]  We need to intimidate the President.
[02:12:52.891 --> 02:12:54.932]  He's not ignoring the courts.
[02:12:54.932 --> 02:12:56.052]  He's winning in the courts.
[02:12:56.052 --> 02:12:57.733]  So they're trying to organize this everywhere.
[02:12:57.733 --> 02:12:59.714]  I've got the other Congressmen saying, take him out.
[02:12:59.714 --> 02:13:00.274]  Remove him.
[02:13:00.274 --> 02:13:01.154]  I want him gone.
[02:13:01.154 --> 02:13:06.976]  Well, they haven't been able to do that yet, so they're organizing guns against the President.
[02:13:06.976 --> 02:13:13.258]  And the way this normally works, even in the U.S., say, a hundred years ago,
[02:13:14.651 --> 02:13:21.918]  Is we were a free, open country, but if you started organizing, killing the president or killing other people, you know, usually some bad things happen real fast.
[02:13:21.918 --> 02:13:29.706]  Or you went for a canoe and you fell off and a couple people, an airplane blows up, somebody forgets to turn their car off in the garage.
[02:13:29.706 --> 02:13:32.789]  I mean, a lot of these guys, and I don't want that to happen, but here's the deal.
[02:13:32.789 --> 02:13:36.472]  They're trying to start the big one, which could hurt my children and other people.
[02:13:36.472 --> 02:13:37.974]  And I'm getting sick of these wimps.
[02:13:38.354 --> 02:13:39.875]  Run in their mouths, Roger!
[02:13:39.875 --> 02:13:41.255]  Run in their damn mouths!
[02:13:41.255 --> 02:13:43.396]  Run in their little cowardly-ass mouths!
[02:13:43.396 --> 02:13:46.977]  People aren't going to take this much longer, Roger!
[02:13:46.977 --> 02:13:50.618]  Well, Alex, the problem here is there seems to be two standards.
[02:13:50.618 --> 02:14:02.883]  The very people who bemoan the fact that there's no civility in our politics, who consistently say the President is rude and vulgar, are the exact same people who are constantly advocating violence,
[02:14:03.763 --> 02:14:07.906]  Who were paying to disrupt Donald Trump's campaign rallies.
[02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:17.013]  We know from the WikiLeaks disclosures that Hillary herself was a derriere deep in dirty tricks to disrupt Trump's rallies.
[02:14:17.013 --> 02:14:30.122]  The very people who go on Twitter and advocate the violent assassination of the president, the murder of his family, and worse, those are the people who the tech left has no problem with.
[02:14:30.582 --> 02:14:31.503]  Keith Olbermann?
[02:14:31.503 --> 02:14:33.365]  Oh yeah, he can threaten the President.
[02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:34.667]  Roger Stone?
[02:14:34.667 --> 02:14:39.412]  Hurts Jake Tapper's feelings, so we have to take him off Twitter.
[02:14:39.412 --> 02:14:45.238]  All I know is, America isn't going to put up with a violent coup carried out by the left.
[02:14:45.238 --> 02:14:51.905]  And I just hope they're smart and back off, but they don't have any real experience in this in themselves, so I don't think they realize how much danger they're in.
[02:14:53.137 --> 02:15:07.689]  Well, and you saw in that clip of Congressman Swasey, whose only previous accomplishment is the enormous tax increases in Suffolk County when he was the county executive, making life there perhaps the most expensive place on the planet.
[02:15:07.689 --> 02:15:12.533]  But notice that Swasey says, what if the president refuses to obey the courts?
[02:15:13.263 --> 02:15:17.972]  Clearly, Mr. Suozzi doesn't know we have co-equal branches of government.
[02:15:17.972 --> 02:15:25.207]  And unfortunately, in some cases, very much like our FBI and our intelligence agencies, the courts have become politicized.
[02:15:25.782 --> 02:15:34.267]  Particularly left-wing judges on the West Coast who think they have the authority to block national policy, which the president has an authority to assert.
[02:15:34.267 --> 02:15:37.549]  And to tell people to resist ICE when they've got legal, lawful warrants.
[02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:40.030]  This is globalist insurrection in America.
[02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:41.751]  It's a foreign, multinational power.
[02:15:41.751 --> 02:15:42.892]  Shy combat.
[02:15:42.892 --> 02:15:53.318]  And I'm telling the military and the president and everybody else, I know you're already making preparations for this, but it's a clear and present danger, and I think we should deal with it starting about now.
[02:15:53.318 --> 02:15:54.239]  Roger, thank you so much.
[02:15:57.052 --> 02:15:59.515]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[02:15:59.515 --> 02:16:01.357]  They may look the same on the outside.

[02:16:03.779 --> 02:16:06.762]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[02:16:06.762 --> 02:16:09.004]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[02:16:09.004 --> 02:16:11.387]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[02:16:11.387 --> 02:16:13.489]  But it does have magical powers.

[02:18:59.608 --> 02:19:01.548]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:19:01.548 --> 02:19:12.053]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:19:12.053 --> 02:19:15.394]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:19:15.874 --> 02:19:16.154]  Absolutely.
[02:19:38.622 --> 02:19:59.734]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:19:59.734 --> 02:20:02.356]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.131 --> 02:20:28.013]  Well, this is over a year ago.
[02:20:28.013 --> 02:20:28.613]  Hitler dog.
[02:20:28.613 --> 02:20:29.573]  Tens of millions of views.
[02:20:29.573 --> 02:20:33.736]  The guy said, I don't like Hitler, but I want to freak my girlfriend out and have the dog howl Hitler.
[02:20:33.736 --> 02:20:35.737]  Something that famous comedians have done as well.
[02:20:35.737 --> 02:20:37.077]  Tom Cleese.
[02:20:37.077 --> 02:20:37.978]  Of course, Charlie Chaplin.
[02:20:37.978 --> 02:20:39.439]  But now, he gets you convicted.
[02:20:39.439 --> 02:20:41.360]  He's facing six months in jail.
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.501]  That was announced by the London Guardian today.
[02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:44.261]  They're very proud of it.
[02:20:44.261 --> 02:20:45.522]  But here's the offending video.
[02:20:46.351 --> 02:20:53.155]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[02:20:53.155 --> 02:21:00.759]  And so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[02:21:00.759 --> 02:21:02.020]  Buddha!
[02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:03.721]  Do I gas the Jews?
[02:21:03.721 --> 02:21:05.842]  Gas the Jews?
[02:21:05.842 --> 02:21:06.202]  Jews.
[02:21:06.202 --> 02:21:06.462]  Jews.
[02:21:24.958 --> 02:21:30.203]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200.
[02:21:30.203 --> 02:21:30.944]  So there you go.
[02:21:30.944 --> 02:21:32.065]  That was over a year ago.
[02:21:32.065 --> 02:21:33.286]  Now, Mark Meacham.
[02:21:34.964 --> 02:21:39.245]  And of course, Tommy Robinson joins us to break this down.
[02:21:39.245 --> 02:21:40.325]  He's facing jail time.
[02:21:40.325 --> 02:21:45.046]  Tommy's been in jail for criticizing Islam and saying they were kidnapping little girls and grooming them.
[02:21:45.046 --> 02:21:51.707]  He's now been completely confirmed, including his hometown, 4,000 plus, some of which disappeared and were found dead.
[02:21:51.707 --> 02:21:53.888]  So, Mark and Tommy, join us.
[02:21:53.888 --> 02:21:55.648]  Mark, it's in the news today.
[02:21:55.648 --> 02:21:59.729]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[02:21:59.729 --> 02:22:00.629]  That is YouTube.
[02:22:02.557 --> 02:22:06.900]  YouTuber convicted for offensive joke video faces prison.
[02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:11.323]  UK barely recognizable as a free country anymore.
[02:22:11.323 --> 02:22:15.807]  So, Mark, this is being announced that you've been convicted.
[02:22:15.807 --> 02:22:17.268]  Tell us about that happening.
[02:22:17.268 --> 02:22:19.429]  I guess it's the last day.
[02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:24.253]  And now I guess you're facing prison time for saying, I don't like Hitler.
[02:22:24.673 --> 02:22:26.474]  But I'm going to do a nasty joke here.
[02:22:26.474 --> 02:22:34.177]  Well, even if you liked Hitler, the Magna Carta and the law says, you know, you can say that, but this is next level.
[02:22:34.177 --> 02:22:37.278]  So tell us what's happening.
[02:22:37.278 --> 02:22:42.100]  Well, basically the judge turned around and confirmed that he was giving me a guilty verdict.
[02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:45.181]  Some of the things that he said alongside it, though, were extremely troubling.
[02:22:45.181 --> 02:22:49.863]  He turned around and says that he completely rejects the notion that this video was made as a joke.
[02:22:50.761 --> 02:23:00.968]  And he says that I made the video to be purposefully anti-Semitic and that the reason that I made the video was to spread anti-Semitic hatred and encourage anti-Semitic hatred.
[02:23:00.968 --> 02:23:05.811]  And what worries me about that so much is I know my intentions.
[02:23:05.811 --> 02:23:08.612]  I know why I made the video and it was to annoy my girlfriend.
[02:23:08.612 --> 02:23:09.873]  I know the truth.
[02:23:09.873 --> 02:23:12.435]  That is the reality of the situation.
[02:23:12.435 --> 02:23:17.698]  And what the judge has done is just completely rejected that and instead labeled me as an anti-Semite.
[02:23:18.846 --> 02:23:23.167]  And I've been found guilty of it, and I'm due to be sentenced on the 23rd of April.
[02:23:23.167 --> 02:23:29.928]  So they've raped your rights already, and now they're raping what you stand for and who you are?
[02:23:29.928 --> 02:23:31.348]  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
[02:23:31.348 --> 02:23:38.670]  It's a huge attack on my character, because I don't exactly want to be known as that, especially when I know in my heart that that's not what I am.
[02:23:38.670 --> 02:23:44.591]  Like, I know what's in my head, but however, I'm kind of having it dictated to me who I am.
[02:23:46.004 --> 02:23:47.505]  Well, Mark, here's my issue.
[02:23:47.505 --> 02:23:49.206]  I mean, I know UK law, I know ours.
[02:23:49.206 --> 02:23:55.048]  I know they've passed laws in Europe and there that are unconstitutional, but you, you argued, hey, I didn't mean this in this way.
[02:23:55.048 --> 02:24:10.416]  And I told you a year ago, I was like, man, I'd argue the whole thing's unconstitutional to begin with, because if somebody, now they're saying, oh, any criticism, you know, they're saying, arrest me for, you know, criticizing young people that are, are, are, are, are, are anti-gun.
[02:24:10.416 --> 02:24:12.277]  I mean, you can see the slippery slope here.
[02:24:13.726 --> 02:24:15.207]  Yeah, I can see it.
[02:24:15.207 --> 02:24:23.270]  Whenever the government tries to get 1% of control over anything, they will spend all of their time and money and power trying to turn that 1% into 100%.
[02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:26.192]  And we've seen that all the way through history.
[02:24:26.192 --> 02:24:39.478]  And it's like any government in any way, throughout history, has demonstrated throughout history, who has tried to curtail or stop freedom of speech has never ever done so for honest reasons, ever in history.
[02:24:40.475 --> 02:24:44.018]  Well, yeah, Tommy points this out, Paul Watson points this out in these videos.
[02:24:44.018 --> 02:24:47.100]  Hundreds of known jihadis saying, I'm going to murder, I'm going to kill.
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:52.144]  And they're brought into the country and allowed to go around and preach they're going to kill everybody.
[02:24:52.144 --> 02:24:59.910]  But then Tommy gets thrown in jail for stuff even less than you're about to be thrown in jail, Tommy.
[02:24:59.910 --> 02:25:05.474]  The worrying thing I'd say is that they've said, because it's a crime to be grossly offensive.
[02:25:05.474 --> 02:25:07.315]  Where does that stop?
[02:25:07.315 --> 02:25:09.817]  If I was to say to a Muslim... Well, that allows them to define it!
[02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:12.191]  That's exactly what it does.
[02:25:12.191 --> 02:25:19.554]  If I was to say to a Muslim, for example, Lauren Southern, who's just been stopped from coming into the country, she said, Allah is gay.
[02:25:19.554 --> 02:25:22.296]  If a Muslim finds that grossly offensive, is that now a crime?
[02:25:22.296 --> 02:25:24.177]  Are you going to arrest someone for that?
[02:25:24.177 --> 02:25:28.259]  If I point out a fact that Mohammed was a paedophile, will I be arrested for that?
[02:25:28.259 --> 02:25:32.021]  And this seems to be, I'd say that they've got in through the back door,
[02:25:33.027 --> 02:25:36.390]  To prevent people being able to criticize any religion.
[02:25:36.390 --> 02:25:46.457]  Because, basically, if you set this as a precedent, which is what they do now with court cases, if someone's prosecuted, they will bring this case up and say the judge found that this man was guilty.
[02:25:46.457 --> 02:25:47.658]  Sure, they're setting precedents.
[02:25:47.658 --> 02:25:48.539]  They're setting precedents.
[02:25:49.428 --> 02:25:53.894]  They're saying presidents, they're saying presidents, and the thing is, it is a complete joke.
[02:25:53.894 --> 02:25:56.138]  He says it's a joke.
[02:25:56.138 --> 02:25:57.840]  Three million people watched this video.
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:58.641]  It's more than that.
[02:25:58.641 --> 02:26:01.125]  And none of them complained.
[02:26:01.125 --> 02:26:02.006]  None of them complained.
[02:26:02.006 --> 02:26:03.128]  What they really fear is humour.
[02:26:06.304 --> 02:26:15.872]  Well, what came out in court, Alex, was that the police went off their own back, off their own intelligence, to come and arrest Mark.
[02:26:15.872 --> 02:26:25.079]  They also notified the press, which was unheard of, so that before he'd been interviewed, before he'd even been arrested, the press were waiting outside to photograph, as one massive virtue signal.
[02:26:25.743 --> 02:26:28.005]  And that's basically what they've done.
[02:26:28.005 --> 02:26:28.465]  Yeah.
[02:26:28.465 --> 02:26:36.612]  But that virtue stooping will now result in the possibility that he's going to... Exactly, because under, for folks that don't know, under common law, English common law, US common law, Magna Carta, all of that...
[02:26:37.492 --> 02:26:40.474]  People are supposed to make the report.
[02:26:40.474 --> 02:26:44.856]  It's seen as very dangerous when the government itself goes out and does this.
[02:26:44.856 --> 02:26:50.339]  So they went out, they virtue-signaled, they got the media involved, knowing this would get a big viral attention.
[02:26:50.339 --> 02:26:59.244]  It was a viral story to set the precedent that even if you're more of a libertarian liberal, like Mark, and say, I don't like Hitler, we're going to put your ass in prison.
[02:26:59.244 --> 02:27:00.545]  I mean, that is so dangerous.
[02:27:00.545 --> 02:27:04.127]  I mean, that's like you're living in North Korea or something, Mark.
[02:27:04.127 --> 02:27:05.568]  I mean, how is this for you to deal with?
[02:27:07.098 --> 02:27:13.001]  Well basically I've spent the last part of two years not being able to actually find a job or anything.
[02:27:13.001 --> 02:27:17.943]  As soon as I get a job anywhere within a week I get recognised and they just immediately file me on the spot.
[02:27:17.943 --> 02:27:23.906]  The only reason I have a job just now is I'm working part time with friends and pretty much the majority of my income comes from YouTube.
[02:27:24.986 --> 02:27:26.407]  There's other stuff as well.
[02:27:26.407 --> 02:27:27.448]  I used to be a bouncer.
[02:27:27.448 --> 02:27:31.810]  That's what I used to do for a living, but I can't do that anymore.
[02:27:31.810 --> 02:27:35.112]  Employment wise, I've had pretty much every door closed.
[02:27:35.112 --> 02:27:37.714]  Think about political correctness.
[02:27:37.714 --> 02:27:43.357]  Blackballing you, destroying you, blacklisting you, just destroying your life.
[02:27:43.357 --> 02:27:44.618]  This is authoritarianism.
[02:27:45.695 --> 02:27:47.277]  It's called social consequences.
[02:27:47.277 --> 02:28:03.334]  What people will usually do is if they can't get you for your speech under the law, they'll do things called social consequences where they'll get the press to smear you, try and get your employers to fire you and then if none of that works what they usually do is turn up with masks on and beat you up and try and shut down your talks and de-platform you.
[02:28:03.334 --> 02:28:06.258]  It's just a classic far-left tactics is pretty much what it is.
[02:28:07.034 --> 02:28:17.643]  Well, when we come back, I want to ask you guys how we strike back, because I think that they have really, really jumped the shark on this in a big, big way, and I want to ask you where we go and what we do.
[02:28:17.643 --> 02:28:21.806]  I mean, I think everybody should really use your case in solidarity.
[02:28:21.806 --> 02:28:24.428]  This should go to your Supreme Court.
[02:28:24.428 --> 02:28:30.113]  They've defamed you, saying in the media that they're taking this down because you hurt Jewish people.
[02:28:30.113 --> 02:28:32.735]  They're speaking for you, and that's a defamation right there.
[02:28:32.735 --> 02:28:33.496]  These bullies!
[02:28:34.136 --> 02:28:46.800]  need to pay for what they're doing trying to turn the UK into the very same anti-free speech prison that Europe is under the unelected dictatorship of the grandson of the richest Nazi family, Juncker.
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:51.402]  We'll be right back as we fight true Nazi policies in the name of fighting Nazis.

[02:29:56.769 --> 02:30:07.381]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:30:07.381 --> 02:30:09.443]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:30:09.443 --> 02:30:12.306]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:30:12.306 --> 02:30:13.788]  It's made in the USA.
[02:30:13.788 --> 02:30:16.931]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:30:17.151 --> 02:30:20.613]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:30:20.613 --> 02:30:22.674]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:30:22.674 --> 02:30:32.399]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:30:32.399 --> 02:30:44.906]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:30:44.946 --> 02:30:49.490]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting-edge science
[02:31:02.842 --> 02:31:07.965]  We are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.

[02:31:41.151 --> 02:31:46.537]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[02:32:59.753 --> 02:33:02.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:21.362]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:21.362 --> 02:33:35.809]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.809 --> 02:33:38.970]  Mark Meakin is facing up to six months in jail and a fine.
[02:33:38.970 --> 02:33:44.093]  He was just convicted of hurting people's feelings as he did Hitler Dog.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:48.621]  You know, the funny thing is I have a video on YouTube called Hitler Dog.
[02:33:48.621 --> 02:33:52.422]  My late French Bulldog that died last year, Captain.
[02:33:52.422 --> 02:33:56.264]  And he looked like he had a Hitler mustache.
[02:33:56.264 --> 02:33:58.664]  And so I made the point that, remember J.C.
[02:33:58.664 --> 02:33:59.525]  Penney?
[02:33:59.525 --> 02:34:01.826]  This was like five years ago now.
[02:34:01.826 --> 02:34:02.306]  J.C.
[02:34:02.306 --> 02:34:08.088]  Penney banned a teapot because the reflection on it might look like Hitler.
[02:34:08.088 --> 02:34:11.789]  That's like looking at a cloud and thinking it's a giraffe or broccoli.
[02:34:13.414 --> 02:34:14.815]  Would that be banned as well?
[02:34:14.815 --> 02:34:25.182]  Because it's obviously funny, just like John Cleese did, just like everybody else has done, Charlie Chaplin, saying you're pro-Hitler but making a joke.
[02:34:25.182 --> 02:34:36.509]  But even if you want to be a Nazi, you've got that right, and to have your dog howl Hitler, you could say, well, YouTube has its rules, you can't.
[02:34:36.509 --> 02:34:37.950]  Oh, but now you're arrested, see?
[02:34:39.585 --> 02:34:41.126]  That old thing of, oh, it's their company.
[02:34:41.126 --> 02:34:43.068]  No, it wasn't even YouTube that did it.
[02:34:43.068 --> 02:34:44.149]  That's where this is going.
[02:34:44.149 --> 02:34:49.853]  That's the social justice warriors from the colleges in Europe, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia.
[02:34:49.853 --> 02:34:53.956]  They then are brought into the police departments.
[02:34:53.956 --> 02:35:02.643]  And it's frightening to see now radical Islamists being put in as police chiefs and mayors all over the place.
[02:35:04.241 --> 02:35:08.643]  And by the way, I think this was funnier than the great dictator Charlie Chaplin's, which is great, well done.
[02:35:08.643 --> 02:35:10.624]  I think this is funnier than John Cleese.
[02:35:10.624 --> 02:35:14.265]  I think Chaplin's better than John Cleese at the Hitler imitations.
[02:35:14.265 --> 02:35:16.766]  And this is better.
[02:35:16.766 --> 02:35:18.527]  This is better than John Cleese.
[02:35:18.527 --> 02:35:19.847]  I'm serious.
[02:35:19.847 --> 02:35:21.308]  This is better than John Cleese.
[02:35:21.308 --> 02:35:22.528]  This is better than Charlie Chaplin.
[02:35:22.528 --> 02:35:25.870]  And his name's Mark Meekin.
[02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:27.910]  And he isn't getting a show on the BBC, baby.
[02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:29.091]  He's going to prison.
[02:35:30.182 --> 02:35:31.203]  Well, we know he'll be targeted.
[02:35:31.203 --> 02:35:32.964]  He just said he's getting fired, losing everything.
[02:35:32.964 --> 02:35:35.905]  So, Mark, I love the fact you have a good, jolly attitude about this.
[02:35:35.905 --> 02:35:38.527]  But man, people, that's the problem with patriots, though.
[02:35:38.527 --> 02:35:39.968]  Just normal, common sense folks.
[02:35:39.968 --> 02:35:40.568]  We're not wimps.
[02:35:40.568 --> 02:35:41.809]  We don't grandstand.
[02:35:41.809 --> 02:35:44.290]  Everybody should be decrying this, my friend.
[02:35:44.290 --> 02:35:48.512]  I mean, you need to be given TV shows for your comedy genius.
[02:35:48.512 --> 02:35:51.054]  In fact, where is the original Hitler dog?
[02:35:51.054 --> 02:35:52.114]  What's the original name?
[02:35:52.114 --> 02:35:52.955]  Where is it in mirrors?
[02:35:52.955 --> 02:35:54.696]  All I have is Paul playing a clip of it.
[02:35:54.696 --> 02:35:56.557]  Where do we find this forbidden fruit?
[02:35:57.892 --> 02:35:59.374]  YouTube removed it.
[02:35:59.374 --> 02:36:04.778]  I haven't got it re-uploaded anywhere else because the original crime itself was actually me posting the video online.
[02:36:04.778 --> 02:36:07.500]  Like, me being in the video and stuff like that.
[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:12.064]  So maybe I should fly to the UK, publicly upload this at Peekers, Peekers Corner.
[02:36:12.064 --> 02:36:18.229]  I mean, or John Cleese, have you noticed John Cleese has come out and said this is wrong?
[02:36:18.229 --> 02:36:19.870]  I don't know, I didn't see that.
[02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:21.992]  He's come out and said all this political correctness is very dangerous.
[02:36:23.118 --> 02:36:24.238]  Political correctness, yeah.
[02:36:24.238 --> 02:36:28.700]  Political correctness is essentially just trying to curtail comedy as a whole.
[02:36:28.700 --> 02:36:31.920]  People seem to think that just because they get offended they have some kind of right.
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:36.962]  That immediately means that my opinion trumps everybody else's in the rooms because my feelings are hurt.
[02:36:36.962 --> 02:36:38.282]  And that's not how it works.
[02:36:38.282 --> 02:36:42.783]  But for some reason, society is starting to believe that that is how things work.
[02:36:42.783 --> 02:36:45.384]  It's a case of they're your emotions, you manage them.
[02:36:45.384 --> 02:36:49.265]  Don't expect everybody else in the world to change just because you can't manage your own feelings.
[02:36:51.749 --> 02:36:55.050]  Well, I mean, why did the Jewish leader go and say it was grossly offensive?
[02:36:55.050 --> 02:36:58.991]  Doesn't he understand that's like Nazi Germany to lock somebody up for their speech?
[02:36:58.991 --> 02:37:00.152]  Well, that's his job.
[02:37:00.152 --> 02:37:02.593]  In the position it is.
[02:37:02.593 --> 02:37:04.133]  His job is to find the outrage.
[02:37:04.133 --> 02:37:07.914]  I actually have a very large fan base in Israel.
[02:37:07.914 --> 02:37:13.956]  All of them are practicing Jews and one thing that they really, really don't like being perpetuated is the victim complex.
[02:37:13.956 --> 02:37:16.037]  See if there's something that is like a genuine
[02:37:16.537 --> 02:37:17.278]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:37:31.798 --> 02:37:32.458]  We're good to go.
[02:37:57.307 --> 02:37:58.949]  Alright, well we caught both of those.
[02:37:58.949 --> 02:38:02.234]  We're on a bunch of commercial radio stations and TV stations, so please don't cut us anymore.
[02:38:02.234 --> 02:38:03.655]  I understand you can in the UK.
[02:38:03.655 --> 02:38:04.396]  It's no big deal, Mark.
[02:38:04.396 --> 02:38:04.957]  You're not bad.
[02:38:04.957 --> 02:38:07.561]  It's just that our delay then has to build back up.
[02:38:07.561 --> 02:38:08.983]  So we want to do that for our affiliates.
[02:38:11.041 --> 02:38:12.301]  Tommy, you've been sitting here very quietly.
[02:38:12.301 --> 02:38:19.243]  You're a man who first rang the alarm bell, they lied about you, they put you in prison for you lost your house, the Muslims tried to kill you.
[02:38:19.243 --> 02:38:22.284]  I mean, what is it like seeing this expand and see the UK?
[02:38:22.284 --> 02:38:23.984]  I mean, I'm pinching myself.
[02:38:23.984 --> 02:38:26.664]  This is truly authoritarian.
[02:38:26.664 --> 02:38:29.205]  This is super dangerous.
[02:38:29.205 --> 02:38:36.927]  In the country where free speech in the modern tense 800 years ago began.
[02:38:36.927 --> 02:38:37.647]  What it's like for me is...
[02:38:38.714 --> 02:38:47.407]  I know full well what it's like to go through a court case and to have it hanging over your head, which is why when I met Mark and I speak to him, I'd ask, how is it for your mother?
[02:38:47.407 --> 02:38:49.270]  This isn't just a sentence.
[02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:51.614]  Even the fact that they've put it off for another month now.
[02:38:52.589 --> 02:39:02.612]  That there, even the fact that they could have dealt with it today, it's still to teach a lesson, still for the longer, so that this cloud's hanging over you, you're constantly worrying.
[02:39:02.612 --> 02:39:04.853]  I watched today as his missus and they sat and held hands.
[02:39:04.853 --> 02:39:19.357]  I watched the panic and the fear on her face and the worry on her face and that's what gets to me because I know, I know what my wife's gone through, I know what my mum's gone through, I know what my children go through, so I know when they're doing this to Mark, they're doing it to his family and I know that
[02:39:20.152 --> 02:39:23.231]  This attack, which is a current attack that we're witnessing...
[02:39:24.034 --> 02:39:38.605]  Whilst I say, I don't want to sound like I think it's good, but anything that highlights to the public and to the world just how far our country shifted, I think is beneficial in the sense of we need the public to be awake to this.
[02:39:38.605 --> 02:39:40.186]  We need people to realise this.
[02:39:40.186 --> 02:39:42.408]  Because it's like a chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.
[02:39:42.408 --> 02:39:44.890]  They chip away at our rights and our freedoms.
[02:39:44.890 --> 02:39:52.516]  And over the last 10 days, what with Brittany Pettibone, Martin Sellner, Lauren Southern, Lutz Backman and now Mark,
[02:39:53.724 --> 02:39:55.245]  It's all there for the world to see.
[02:39:55.245 --> 02:40:00.269]  Everyone can see that we now live, how we're living under a authoritarian government.
[02:40:00.269 --> 02:40:10.037]  And the reason it's important is, I'll see headlines, BBC, 5,000 racists arrested, police secretly overheard them in cafes saying political incorrectness.
[02:40:10.037 --> 02:40:11.978]  I saw that six, seven years ago.
[02:40:11.978 --> 02:40:13.660]  So it's going on behind the scenes.
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:15.721]  Most people get too scared to speak out.
[02:40:15.721 --> 02:40:17.223]  You guys are speaking out.
[02:40:17.223 --> 02:40:22.547]  That's the final piece of the equation, bringing this evil, this creeping death out in the open, Tommy.
[02:40:24.617 --> 02:40:26.178]  This is to send a message.
[02:40:26.178 --> 02:40:28.139]  What they've done to Mark is to send a message.
[02:40:28.139 --> 02:40:30.920]  And this message works, unfortunately.
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:40.824]  The people who would have been making jokes and making crude comments and having a laugh and a bit of banter about religions, be it Judaism, Christianity or Islam, will now be scared to.
[02:40:41.676 --> 02:40:43.138]  They will now be scared to.
[02:40:43.138 --> 02:40:51.990]  And that's why for the last 10 years, or for longer, people have been walking on eggshells and treading on eggshells, constantly scared.
[02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:55.575]  And these actions by the government and the police only add to that.
[02:40:55.575 --> 02:40:56.276]  And they know that.
[02:40:56.776 --> 02:40:57.496]  And they know that.
[02:40:57.496 --> 02:40:58.397]  And that's what this is about.
[02:40:58.397 --> 02:41:02.819]  This is about silencing the public so that no one will challenge what they're doing.
[02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:04.140]  No one will speak up.
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:05.581]  And no one will even be able to joke.
[02:41:05.581 --> 02:41:07.181]  This is how far it's gone.
[02:41:07.181 --> 02:41:14.625]  It's gone that far that rather than people making crude comments or speaking online in a negative way about religions, people are having a joke.
[02:41:14.625 --> 02:41:23.730]  Part of being British is... And what people realise is that whether it be distasteful or dark humour, that's what British people find funny.
[02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:26.171]  And that's what they've now made against the law.
[02:41:27.130 --> 02:41:31.379]  And I said there is an option to appeal this.
[02:41:31.379 --> 02:41:33.263]  There is an option to appeal this, but it costs...
[02:41:33.956 --> 02:41:35.156]  How much did they say?
[02:41:35.156 --> 02:41:38.458]  I think it was estimated it would be around £50,000.
[02:41:38.458 --> 02:41:39.578]  So they win again!
[02:41:39.578 --> 02:41:41.839]  Well, you need to have lawyers and barristers come forward.
[02:41:41.839 --> 02:41:45.280]  There needs to be organisations that are pro-free speech.
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:47.561]  You're having your whole future stolen.
[02:41:47.561 --> 02:41:55.904]  And again, when Charlie Chaplin did The Dictator, where it looks pro-Hitler and he's bouncing the world off his butt, you could say someone is offended by that.
[02:41:55.904 --> 02:41:59.426]  I think it makes Hitler look like he's in a good light.
[02:41:59.426 --> 02:42:00.486]  Obviously it doesn't.
[02:42:00.486 --> 02:42:02.167]  You can't operate like this.
[02:42:02.167 --> 02:42:03.127]  This is pure tyranny.
[02:42:05.339 --> 02:42:13.246]  It's just, it's actually gotten to the point, the thing that frightens me the most is the fact that your intent and context do not matter.
[02:42:13.246 --> 02:42:19.952]  It's the case of, you know exactly what you meant by what you said, but another person who's usually... But you said I don't like Hitler!
[02:42:19.952 --> 02:42:25.317]  You said I don't like Nazis, so it's gonna be fine to make the dog do something bad.
[02:42:25.317 --> 02:42:28.680]  But you should be able to say I like them, even, you know, it's crazy.
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:29.321]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:30.490 --> 02:42:31.010]  It's unbelievable.
[02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:32.691]  It's total authoritarianism.
[02:42:32.691 --> 02:42:35.073]  And then we get into it and go, oh, we didn't mean it like that.
[02:42:35.073 --> 02:42:35.893]  They don't care.
[02:42:35.893 --> 02:42:39.315]  They are the ones bringing in the Hitler lovers.
[02:42:39.315 --> 02:42:41.656]  They are the ones bringing in the Islamists.
[02:42:41.656 --> 02:42:43.757]  They are the ones crushing the West.
[02:42:43.757 --> 02:42:45.158]  They are the globalists.
[02:42:45.158 --> 02:42:46.439]  They are the plague.
[02:42:46.439 --> 02:42:48.760]  Hitler wanted to get rid of free speech and Christianity.
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:49.800]  They are the enemy.
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:50.701]  They are Hitler.
[02:42:58.595 --> 02:42:59.996]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[02:42:59.996 --> 02:43:02.237]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:43:02.237 --> 02:43:02.697]  Great.
[02:43:02.697 --> 02:43:03.817]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:43:03.817 --> 02:43:08.359]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[02:43:08.359 --> 02:43:10.040]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:17.443]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:43:17.443 --> 02:43:18.204]  Wow, thank you.
[02:43:18.204 --> 02:43:20.845]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[02:43:20.845 --> 02:43:22.686]  Which sucraceuticals do you like best?
[02:43:22.686 --> 02:43:25.987]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:43:26.147 --> 02:43:26.667]  That's amazing.
[02:43:26.667 --> 02:43:27.408]  That's really incredible.
[02:43:27.408 --> 02:43:30.470]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:43:30.470 --> 02:43:31.831]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[02:43:31.831 --> 02:43:34.733]  My morning was fantastic, and I love these guys.
[02:43:34.733 --> 02:43:43.760]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:44.781]  You will love it.
[02:43:44.781 --> 02:43:46.942]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[02:43:46.942 --> 02:43:51.365]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:43:51.365 --> 02:43:53.207]  It's a win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:43:55.743 --> 02:44:00.144]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:44:00.144 --> 02:44:08.226]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:44:08.226 --> 02:44:13.507]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:44:13.507 --> 02:44:16.047]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:44:16.047 --> 02:44:20.268]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:44:20.268 --> 02:44:22.709]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:30.635]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:44:30.635 --> 02:44:38.701]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:44:38.701 --> 02:44:45.887]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:44:45.887 --> 02:44:47.348]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:44:47.348 --> 02:44:49.170]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:44:49.970 --> 02:44:53.432]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your model now.
[02:44:53.432 --> 02:44:56.695]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:56.695 --> 02:44:59.496]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:44:59.496 --> 02:45:01.738]  It's MycoZX Plus.
[02:45:01.738 --> 02:45:09.943]  Lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed a year contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer.
[02:45:09.943 --> 02:45:10.744]  Scalability.
[02:45:10.744 --> 02:45:13.205]  But now, we're able to go at 50% off, $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[02:45:13.205 --> 02:45:14.746]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot
[02:45:19.149 --> 02:45:21.451]  It's the other side of the equation.
[02:45:21.451 --> 02:45:31.258]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help this place.
[02:45:31.258 --> 02:45:40.124]  Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[02:45:40.124 --> 02:45:46.088]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[02:45:46.548 --> 02:45:49.371]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[02:45:49.371 --> 02:45:56.297]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[02:45:56.297 --> 02:46:03.843]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:46:05.424 --> 02:46:16.267]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:46:16.267 --> 02:46:18.368]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:46:18.368 --> 02:46:22.389]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:23.409]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[02:46:23.829 --> 02:46:32.015]  We've got the best plug-on free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:37.458]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:46:37.458 --> 02:46:39.960]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:49.126]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:46:49.126 --> 02:46:53.589]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:46:59.311 --> 02:47:15.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.699 --> 02:47:15.899]  Cheers.
[02:47:29.588 --> 02:47:44.096]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live and I didn't even think to ask, after he's been convicted of being a thought criminal, our guest Mark Meakin is here with the great Tommy Robinson there in London, and I said where is
[02:47:45.057 --> 02:47:46.298]  Where is Hitler Dog?
[02:47:46.298 --> 02:47:48.199]  And I'm going to out the dog.
[02:47:48.199 --> 02:47:51.301]  Buda is the real name of his girlfriend's pug.
[02:47:51.301 --> 02:47:53.022]  A very handsome, very large pug.
[02:47:53.022 --> 02:47:55.784]  I noticed his feet were up earlier and I said, get those down.
[02:47:55.784 --> 02:47:57.986]  That's more prison time, a double Heil Hitler.
[02:47:57.986 --> 02:47:59.927]  But we're joking here.
[02:47:59.927 --> 02:48:06.392]  So Mark and Tommy, introduce the world to the dreaded Hitlerian creature.
[02:48:06.392 --> 02:48:09.734]  This is Buda, future Chancellor of the Fourth Reich.
[02:48:11.176 --> 02:48:21.945]  This is apparently the dog that I was using as a smoke screen to quote the prosecutor's own words to secretly spread my truly Nazi and anti-Semitic views.
[02:48:21.945 --> 02:48:23.787]  He says that I was basically trying to use this
[02:48:24.781 --> 02:48:34.310]  By the way, that's critical to the left because they know there's not a lot of real Nazis.
[02:48:34.310 --> 02:48:40.195]  They want to see everything's coded and want to arrest you for the coded stuff so they can then go after everybody and that's what they have said.
[02:48:40.976 --> 02:48:46.458]  When I said Brian Stelter looks like a demon, they said, well, he's not really Jewish, Mr. Jones.
[02:48:46.458 --> 02:48:47.938]  I never said Brian Stelter was Jewish.
[02:48:47.938 --> 02:48:49.339]  It's like mental illness.
[02:48:49.339 --> 02:48:51.179]  I said, Brian Stelter looks like a demon.
[02:48:51.179 --> 02:48:54.380]  And they go, Jones only said it because he thought he's Jewish, but he's not.
[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:55.361]  And then I never said that.
[02:48:56.121 --> 02:49:00.043]  I said, who would put out PR photos where they have this demonic looking Joker grin?
[02:49:00.043 --> 02:49:06.107]  You know, I'm not saying that, uh, you know, the guy that plays the Joker, Jack Nicholson's Jewish either.
[02:49:06.107 --> 02:49:08.588]  I mean, it's like they just, it's crazy.
[02:49:08.588 --> 02:49:10.149]  It's like seeing Hitler in the teapot.
[02:49:10.149 --> 02:49:11.610]  Can we see Hitler dog again, please?
[02:49:11.610 --> 02:49:13.811]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:13.811 --> 02:49:17.734]  Buddha.
[02:49:17.734 --> 02:49:18.594]  Buddha's a rock star.
[02:49:18.594 --> 02:49:20.495]  Well, you guys have got the floor for the time we've got left.
[02:49:20.495 --> 02:49:21.136]  I'm ranting.
[02:49:21.136 --> 02:49:22.817]  What else you want to impart to listeners and viewers?
[02:49:24.878 --> 02:49:29.484]  Um, there's not really much else I can say except, like, all of this is pretty much his fault.
[02:49:29.484 --> 02:49:32.228]  Like, I just held the camera.
[02:49:32.228 --> 02:49:34.070]  I didn't really do anything, it's all him.
[02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:37.414]  Look at his face as well!
[02:49:37.414 --> 02:49:38.516]  This is what it's all about!
[02:49:38.516 --> 02:49:40.599]  He could be going general because of this!
[02:49:40.599 --> 02:49:42.121]  I really like that, that's a good looking pug.
[02:49:43.168 --> 02:49:52.013]  Well, you know, he's actually Japanese and English because French Bulldogs originally got bred down by the lacemakers there and then exported to the ladies of the night in Paris.
[02:49:52.013 --> 02:49:54.875]  That's how they got popularized 250 years ago.
[02:49:54.875 --> 02:49:58.677]  But the pug, I guess, is from China and Japan, or part of what it is.
[02:49:58.677 --> 02:50:03.580]  So this is not a Nazi dog here.
[02:50:03.580 --> 02:50:03.820]  No.
[02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:10.023]  A lot of people, especially the media, don't seem to realize that a dog can't exactly choose its place on the political spectrum.
[02:50:10.023 --> 02:50:12.165]  That's a good little animal.
[02:50:13.092 --> 02:50:16.017]  I bet your girlfriend likes Buddha.
[02:50:16.017 --> 02:50:17.739]  Oh yeah, she likes him more than me.
[02:50:17.739 --> 02:50:19.121]  Yeah, easily.
[02:50:19.121 --> 02:50:20.443]  Which is what the joke was about?
[02:50:20.443 --> 02:50:21.985]  Yeah, that pretty much was it.
[02:50:21.985 --> 02:50:23.528]  I just wanted to piss her off.
[02:50:23.528 --> 02:50:26.172]  I might be going to jail for it.
[02:50:26.172 --> 02:50:27.394]  What does your girlfriend think about this now?
[02:50:29.463 --> 02:50:34.507]  She's just, well she's not angry at me anymore, she's kind of angry mostly at the Justice for the last two years.
[02:50:34.507 --> 02:50:38.050]  She just really wants this to be over and just wants it to move on.
[02:50:38.050 --> 02:50:46.137]  Nazi Pug as a whole has been pretty much a dead meme for quite a while now, but the courts are keeping it alive for some reason.
[02:50:46.137 --> 02:50:47.739]  But I just kind of want this.
[02:50:47.739 --> 02:50:51.983]  I'm hoping it'll finally come to an end, you know, next month, better for worse.
[02:50:52.918 --> 02:50:53.678]  Hopefully for Belle.
[02:50:53.678 --> 02:50:57.039]  Well I've seen a lot of cute pugs, but that's a particularly cute pug right there.
[02:50:57.039 --> 02:50:58.439]  He looks really sweet.
[02:50:58.439 --> 02:51:00.680]  Is Buddha a boy?
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:01.260]  Yeah, he's a boy.
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:03.861]  He's not happy being up here though.
[02:51:03.861 --> 02:51:06.101]  We just used an improper gender pronoun actually.
[02:51:06.101 --> 02:51:08.062]  You get some prison time for that in California.
[02:51:08.062 --> 02:51:09.222]  Z!
[02:51:09.222 --> 02:51:09.902]  Z!
[02:51:09.902 --> 02:51:11.683]  Misgendering my dog.
[02:51:11.683 --> 02:51:12.043]  Z!
[02:51:12.043 --> 02:51:13.443]  That's actually a cat!
[02:51:13.443 --> 02:51:16.024]  What if your dog identifies as a cat?
[02:51:16.024 --> 02:51:19.965]  I don't know, I'll need to ask him.
[02:51:22.142 --> 02:51:27.107]  But seriously, they're talking six months fines.
[02:51:27.107 --> 02:51:31.231]  I mean, I guess if you grovel to them and apologize, they might not let you get prison time.
[02:51:31.231 --> 02:51:38.138]  But if you don't roll over and get down on your knees before the authoritarian judge and people, I guess they're going to throw the book at you.
[02:51:38.138 --> 02:51:39.700]  Yeah, it's up to a year.
[02:51:39.700 --> 02:51:41.061]  I could actually get in prison.
[02:51:41.061 --> 02:51:41.962]  It's up to a year.
[02:51:41.962 --> 02:51:43.364]  They're not going to let Paul change his article.
[02:51:43.364 --> 02:51:43.924]  A year?
[02:51:43.924 --> 02:51:44.105]  Wow.
[02:51:45.034 --> 02:51:46.295]  Yeah.
[02:51:46.295 --> 02:51:49.796]  Yeah, but like, it's a case of, I have absolutely no idea at this point.
[02:51:49.796 --> 02:52:02.022]  They're basically deferring sentence for background reports, but one of the things that I would need to do as well is I need to visit a court social worker so that I can get an assessment to see whether or not they should slap a restriction of liberty.
[02:52:02.022 --> 02:52:13.927]  I can't remember the full name of it, but it's a restriction of liberty order on me, which basically means that I would need to wear a GPS tracker tag and I would be under house arrest until I'm sentenced in April.
[02:52:14.682 --> 02:52:17.303]  So that's something that I need to do in the next few days as well.
[02:52:17.303 --> 02:52:19.343]  Well, so they want to silence you, punish you more.
[02:52:19.343 --> 02:52:25.925]  This is the vicious authoritarian left that when they get full power always shoots you in the back of the head and shovel you into graves.
[02:52:25.925 --> 02:52:27.905]  That's where this train ends.
[02:52:27.905 --> 02:52:30.686]  We know where it ends and this is what's coming to the U.S.
[02:52:30.686 --> 02:52:31.246]  I'd say the U.K.
[02:52:31.246 --> 02:52:32.806]  is about two years behind Europe.
[02:52:32.806 --> 02:52:33.926]  Germany, Sweden, everywhere.
[02:52:33.926 --> 02:52:35.007]  It's already there.
[02:52:35.007 --> 02:52:36.987]  Former Stasi hired to run Facebook.
[02:52:36.987 --> 02:52:38.107]  Now it's in the U.K.
[02:52:38.107 --> 02:52:39.208]  Now it's coming here.
[02:52:39.208 --> 02:52:40.228]  They mean business.
[02:52:40.768 --> 02:52:43.489]  We sit around and we joke about all this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:43.489 --> 02:52:46.510]  This is deadly, deadly serious.
[02:52:46.510 --> 02:52:49.792]  Doesn't matter your ancestors were bombed by the Nazis or fought the Nazis.
[02:52:49.792 --> 02:52:50.312]  Doesn't matter.
[02:52:50.312 --> 02:52:58.655]  It's projected by people who actually are what I call the cultural and spiritual children of the Nazis.
[02:52:58.655 --> 02:53:03.417]  Tommy, Mark, any other key points?
[02:53:03.417 --> 02:53:07.059]  I'll just say that this is, it's ongoing.
[02:53:07.059 --> 02:53:09.760]  I know that we had a triumphant day last Sunday.
[02:53:10.852 --> 02:53:17.895]  Four free speech in Speaker's Corner in London, but this is... That's the only positive I'll take from it.
[02:53:17.895 --> 02:53:25.158]  When they make these decisions, when they do this, it's for the world to see and thankfully for shows like this and thankfully for the internet.
[02:53:25.798 --> 02:53:32.721]  Because if it wasn't for that, if they get their way, if they get their way, no one would even be knowing about this case because everyone will be silenced eventually.
[02:53:32.721 --> 02:53:33.902]  And that's the route we see it going down.
[02:53:33.902 --> 02:53:37.143]  I don't know if you saw Sadiq Khan last week was in Texas.
[02:53:37.143 --> 02:53:38.644]  I interviewed a lady yesterday.
[02:53:38.644 --> 02:53:41.846]  You should probably have her on your show, Alex.
[02:53:41.846 --> 02:53:43.086]  I interviewed a lady yesterday.
[02:53:43.086 --> 02:53:44.407]  She's a Muslim lady.
[02:53:44.407 --> 02:53:45.908]  She was born a Muslim.
[02:53:45.908 --> 02:53:47.588]  She was into a forced marriage.
[02:53:47.588 --> 02:53:48.769]  She was raped.
[02:53:48.769 --> 02:53:52.951]  She experienced all the bad parts from the cultural problems that are within Islam.
[02:53:53.795 --> 02:53:58.116]  And then she messaged Sadiq Khan and put out a tweet about knife crime.
[02:53:58.116 --> 02:54:07.819]  And she replied saying, if someone takes a knife and hacks away the vagina of a child, will the full force of the law come down on them?
[02:54:07.819 --> 02:54:13.181]  Now what he did is he spoke in Texas and his speech was about hate speech.
[02:54:13.181 --> 02:54:14.201]  And it's all about this.
[02:54:14.201 --> 02:54:17.022]  It's all about silencing and stopping people talking.
[02:54:17.022 --> 02:54:20.363]  And he used her tweet as an example of hate speech.
[02:54:21.621 --> 02:54:22.722]  I interviewed her yesterday.
[02:54:22.722 --> 02:54:24.404]  She's a gorgeous lady.
[02:54:24.404 --> 02:54:27.328]  So she's born a Muslim.
[02:54:27.328 --> 02:54:28.310]  She's now an ex-Muslim.
[02:54:28.974 --> 02:54:33.916]  She fights for Muslim children and Muslim women who are still within it for their rights.
[02:54:33.916 --> 02:54:37.617]  And here's Sadiq Khan putting her up on a pedestal as a hate preacher.
[02:54:37.617 --> 02:54:42.598]  He's actually using one of the victims of these crimes to try and silence other people who want to talk about it.
[02:54:42.598 --> 02:54:43.018]  I saw this.
[02:54:43.018 --> 02:54:44.859]  Tell people the lady's name so I can see the interview.
[02:54:44.859 --> 02:54:45.839]  But I saw pieces of it.
[02:54:45.839 --> 02:54:48.100]  This was incredible about the leftists and the Islamists.
[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:50.540]  They know that it's Islam that's cutting the genitals off.
[02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:51.781]  They know the left doesn't know that.
[02:54:52.628 --> 02:55:06.292]  So he uses this threatening tweet he got, saying somebody wants to cut his genitals off or something, when he knows full well it's a woman saying, help us, they're hurting us, he takes how she's been abused and raped and sliced, and he makes it about him!
[02:55:06.292 --> 02:55:08.032]  A perfect Islamic man!
[02:55:08.032 --> 02:55:09.453]  A perfect piece of filth!
[02:55:10.734 --> 02:55:17.420]  Shazia Hobbs her name was, and our interview will be going out probably today stroke tomorrow, but she wrote a letter to Sadiq Khan about it.
[02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:18.301]  She wrote a letter to him.
[02:55:18.301 --> 02:55:24.167]  And then he used it to spin it that she was talking about chopping him.
[02:55:24.167 --> 02:55:29.292]  Yeah, he used it as a part of the hate speech that he faces.
[02:55:29.292 --> 02:55:30.713]  Do you know what else he spoke about?
[02:55:30.713 --> 02:55:32.815]  One of the things, he said, I get called a pigeon.
[02:55:33.593 --> 02:55:34.854]  So what?
[02:55:34.854 --> 02:55:36.696]  So what if you get called a pigeon?
[02:55:36.696 --> 02:55:38.038]  You're a public figure!
[02:55:38.038 --> 02:55:39.139]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:39.139 --> 02:55:41.581]  There's no free speech back in Pakistan or wherever you came from.
[02:55:41.581 --> 02:55:48.929]  Do you know what the worst thing is, the most frustrating thing is, in this circumstance, is when you look at what Marx has been prosecuted of.
[02:55:48.929 --> 02:55:52.032]  If I go through, if I read you this, I received this today.
[02:55:52.032 --> 02:55:54.334]  I receive these every day.
[02:55:54.334 --> 02:55:55.756]  No one's ever prosecuted.
[02:55:56.801 --> 02:56:03.745]  I hope you're forced to watch as your family have their veins ripped from their arms.
[02:56:03.745 --> 02:56:07.367]  But this is a man who's threatening death upon my family.
[02:56:07.367 --> 02:56:12.369]  Now that doesn't qualify under their hate speech because I'm white, straight and working class.
[02:56:14.671 --> 02:56:20.155]  Anyone who says anything against a minority, that's why there's no level playing field.
[02:56:20.155 --> 02:56:22.757]  And Muslims are a majority and they're taking over.
[02:56:22.757 --> 02:56:25.379]  Tommy, I want to talk to you both as this unfolds.
[02:56:25.379 --> 02:56:27.620]  Let's talk about your YouTube, where people can go.

[02:56:33.865 --> 02:56:34.525]  Tommy, thank you.
[02:56:34.525 --> 02:56:35.246]  You guys are awesome.
[02:56:36.650 --> 02:56:37.110]  Thank you, ma'am.

[02:57:52.356 --> 02:57:53.196]  I take this.
[02:57:53.196 --> 02:57:54.337]  My family takes this.

[02:58:07.867 --> 02:58:08.988]  I don't feel good.
[02:58:08.988 --> 02:58:12.751]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:58:12.751 --> 02:58:15.453]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:58:15.453 --> 02:58:21.238]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:58:21.238 --> 02:58:24.201]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:58:24.201 --> 02:58:27.744]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:58:27.744 --> 02:58:29.986]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:58:29.986 --> 02:58:30.346]  I love it.
[02:58:30.486 --> 02:58:33.287]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:58:33.287 --> 02:58:34.308]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:34.308 --> 02:58:39.931]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:58:39.931 --> 02:58:42.132]  It's got a five-star rating.

[02:59:44.003 --> 02:59:45.343]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.248 --> 03:00:04.335]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:04.335 --> 03:00:07.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.100 --> 03:00:10.787]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:00:10.787 --> 03:00:13.131]  Run on for a long time.
[03:00:15.874 --> 03:00:18.337]  All right, I want to air part of this Millie Weaver report.
[03:00:18.337 --> 03:00:21.622]  Live in a bubble, abort your kids, and never own guns or cars.
[03:00:21.622 --> 03:00:22.703]  It's too long for the segment.
[03:00:22.703 --> 03:00:23.925]  I'm going to play part of it for Millie Weaver.
[03:00:23.925 --> 03:00:25.006]  It's a good report.
[03:00:25.006 --> 03:00:30.233]  And then I haven't gotten into the rest of the big news where
[03:00:30.974 --> 03:00:39.238]  They're freaking out about the poll that the majority of Americans know that the deep state is operating and is criminal, so they don't know how to deal with that.
[03:00:39.238 --> 03:00:40.279]  A bunch of other news.
[03:00:40.279 --> 03:00:44.941]  I'm going to get into dealing with Trump announcing a meeting with Putin, finally, and more.
[03:00:44.941 --> 03:00:48.743]  And I've got a challenge, too, for David Hogg.
[03:00:48.743 --> 03:00:50.684]  He's challenged to debate me and then backed out.
[03:00:50.684 --> 03:00:52.565]  I've got a challenge for him coming up.
[03:00:52.565 --> 03:00:55.707]  But here is part of that report from Millie Weaver.
[03:01:12.585 --> 03:01:16.286]  Today at South by Southwest around 1230 p.m.
[03:01:16.286 --> 03:01:21.428]  there's going to be a Handmaid's Tale panel called what if Roe had to go.
[03:01:21.428 --> 03:01:36.133]  Essentially what happens if no longer there are abortion rights laws that can allow these women who want to have multiple abortions for even up until full term to continue to have abortions.
[03:01:36.133 --> 03:01:39.154]  The Handmaid's Tale is essentially to make it so that
[03:01:39.694 --> 03:01:44.238]  Motherhood, having babies, is seen as a burden, it's seen as forced.
[03:01:44.238 --> 03:01:48.681]  These feminists believed what would happen if the laws were to come into action.
[03:01:48.681 --> 03:02:09.058]  The whole point of this right here, this show, this panel, this image right here for people to see when they're walking by, is to suggest and subliminally put it out there that there is a battle of the sexes and that essentially all men, all masculinity is bad, is oppressing women.
[03:02:10.059 --> 03:02:10.899]  It's more than that too.
[03:02:10.899 --> 03:02:13.621]  The women wear burkas and full body outfits.
[03:02:13.621 --> 03:02:15.562]  So it's not Islam that's oppressing women.
[03:02:15.562 --> 03:02:17.363]  It's the West that empowered women.
[03:02:17.363 --> 03:02:19.484]  And then femininity and children is a prison.
[03:02:19.484 --> 03:02:20.485]  So Millie's right.
[03:02:20.485 --> 03:02:22.366]  But it's all total inversion.
[03:02:22.366 --> 03:02:26.469]  But Hollywood, pedophile Hollywood, it's going to take good care of you and gang rape you real good.
[03:02:28.208 --> 03:02:31.850]  They don't want to talk about the women in the Middle East that are being oppressed.
[03:02:31.850 --> 03:02:39.453]  No, they'll help support the Muslim Middle East culture that wants to infringe on women's rights in the Middle East.
[03:02:39.453 --> 03:02:40.514]  I want to point out this right here.
[03:02:40.514 --> 03:02:42.054]  Resist, sister.
[03:02:42.054 --> 03:02:47.116]  Resist is a common, obviously it's used with a lot of Black Lives Matter.
[03:02:47.116 --> 03:02:48.137]  Hit pause again.
[03:02:48.137 --> 03:02:50.718]  I'm going to play the whole report when we come back.
[03:02:50.718 --> 03:02:52.459]  Because it's important and not an interrupter.
[03:02:55.512 --> 03:02:58.173]  Resist, sister, the big corporations in Hollywood.
[03:02:58.173 --> 03:02:59.433]  We care about you, sister.
[03:02:59.433 --> 03:03:00.593]  We care about you, ladies.
[03:03:00.593 --> 03:03:03.994]  This was all being produced like Hillary was going to be president.
[03:03:03.994 --> 03:03:12.096]  Handmaid's Tale was being produced in 2016 and then being cut and made and ready for 2018.
[03:03:12.096 --> 03:03:14.437]  Just like the new Homeland was a woman president.
[03:03:15.222 --> 03:03:19.865]  In 2016 into 18, and then it wasn't, so now it's another president.
[03:03:19.865 --> 03:03:27.009]  They just had it all lined up where you don't like Hillary, you don't like women, and then women are supposed to be real dumb and go, you're right.
[03:03:27.009 --> 03:03:28.049]  I didn't play this this week.
[03:03:28.049 --> 03:03:29.190]  It was one of the biggest stories.
[03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:34.413]  I'm going to play Hillary in India about, you know, white women listening to their husbands.
[03:03:37.050 --> 03:03:44.315]  White women, the nine richest groups in the US are all Asian, if you rank them by quote race.
[03:03:44.315 --> 03:03:47.437]  Whites are way down there.
[03:03:47.437 --> 03:03:57.823]  But a woman that's with a husband that's successful or vice versa, or both of them, wouldn't it be smart to go, my kids are doing well, I'm doing well, I've got a great life, my husband's smart.
[03:03:59.252 --> 03:04:02.795]  I like him, I like Trump, he likes Trump.
[03:04:02.795 --> 03:04:09.440]  The patronizing of that, I haven't even got into this because she makes me so sick, but I'm going to get into it now when we come back.
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:23.511]  The fact that Hillary says that women were made by men in the West to vote for Trump, like Western men, like I've got women chained up at home and I cut their genitals off.
[03:04:23.511 --> 03:04:27.094]  If anything, the women of my life are sitting on top of pink pillows.
[03:04:28.664 --> 03:04:32.426]  And it probably isn't even the best thing.
[03:04:32.426 --> 03:04:35.107]  But that's it.
[03:04:35.107 --> 03:04:38.349]  It's what the West is, and I'm an extreme example of that.
[03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:47.654]  Now, if you want to be in a slave brothel with 100 guys raping you until you die, or you want to be sold on a slave block onto a slave ship and taken to a brothel until you're raped to death, Islam's for you.
[03:04:47.654 --> 03:04:51.135]  But again, the left covers that up because they love the desecration of women.
[03:04:51.135 --> 03:04:51.996]  They hate women.
[03:04:54.989 --> 03:04:58.411]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:58.411 --> 03:05:02.374]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:05:02.374 --> 03:05:05.716]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:05:05.716 --> 03:05:08.258]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:05:08.258 --> 03:05:12.981]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:05:12.981 --> 03:05:15.342]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:05:15.342 --> 03:05:21.747]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:22.347 --> 03:05:30.537]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:05:30.537 --> 03:05:35.602]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:05:35.602 --> 03:05:42.590]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:05:43.231 --> 03:05:48.135]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[03:05:51.197 --> 03:06:06.449]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.546 --> 03:06:35.652]  So, Hillary came out, you know, and she said earlier in the week, or last week in India, in between falling down and breaking her arm and falling down three other times, but her health is just fine.
[03:06:35.652 --> 03:06:36.632]  She never falls down either.
[03:06:36.632 --> 03:06:38.293]  That's fake news from Alex Jones.
[03:06:38.293 --> 03:06:42.595]  CNN reports it was Alex Jones and Paul Watson put out the rumor she fell down.
[03:06:42.595 --> 03:06:45.277]  She only slipped, look, then they cut before she falls down.
[03:06:45.277 --> 03:06:47.298]  I mean, they are the kings of fake news.
[03:06:48.376 --> 03:06:53.438]  And then Hillary came out and said, white women voted how their husbands told them.
[03:06:53.438 --> 03:06:56.079]  We can put that article on screen for TV viewers.
[03:06:56.079 --> 03:06:58.240]  But that is the craziness.
[03:06:58.240 --> 03:07:04.223]  Like it or not, studies suggest that Clinton may not be wrong on white women voting like their husbands.
[03:07:04.223 --> 03:07:09.125]  See the lie from the Washington Post from Jeff Bezos?
[03:07:09.125 --> 03:07:12.507]  She said her husbands make them vote!
[03:07:12.507 --> 03:07:15.548]  Not that white women don't vote like their husbands!
[03:07:18.902 --> 03:07:20.222]  See the sleight of hand?
[03:07:20.222 --> 03:07:25.564]  Everything with these people is deception, preying on you, hoping you don't pay attention.
[03:07:25.564 --> 03:07:34.786]  Hillary Clinton blames pressure from men for why white women voted for Trump.
[03:07:34.786 --> 03:07:38.367]  So, that's where all this is going.
[03:07:38.367 --> 03:07:39.887]  And then they show Handmaiden's Tale.
[03:07:41.513 --> 03:07:44.875]  And they've got all these big PR stunts for being a mother, having a baby.
[03:07:44.875 --> 03:07:46.056]  That's all Gloria Steinem.
[03:07:46.056 --> 03:07:47.257]  Gloria Steinem had a bunch of kids.
[03:07:47.257 --> 03:07:49.378]  She worked for the leftist CIA, by the way.
[03:07:49.378 --> 03:07:50.199]  She admits that.
[03:07:50.199 --> 03:07:55.703]  To get women into the workforce, to break up the family, so the state could raise them.
[03:07:55.703 --> 03:07:57.264]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[03:07:57.264 --> 03:08:03.008]  Hillary Clinton blames pressure from men for why white women vote for Trump.
[03:08:03.008 --> 03:08:05.509]  What a racist statement.
[03:08:05.509 --> 03:08:06.210]  And here's the clip.
[03:08:07.128 --> 03:08:24.281]  Well, I should start by explaining that Democrats, going back to my husband even before, but just in recent times, going back to Bill and our candidates and then President Obama, have been losing the white vote, including white women.
[03:08:25.431 --> 03:08:33.355]  We do not do well with white men and we don't do well with married white women.
[03:08:33.355 --> 03:08:50.202]  And part of that is an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss,
[03:08:51.342 --> 03:08:55.065]  Your son, whoever, believes you should.
[03:08:55.065 --> 03:09:11.479]  And what happened in my election is I was on the way to winning white women until former director of the FBI, Jim Comey, dropped that very ill-advised letter on October the 28th.
[03:09:11.479 --> 03:09:12.980]  And my numbers just went down.
[03:09:12.980 --> 03:09:15.702]  And I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence about those people.
[03:09:18.573 --> 03:09:21.494]  She's over in India trying to preach racism against white people.
[03:09:21.494 --> 03:09:22.634]  I mean, that's the backdrop.
[03:09:22.634 --> 03:09:25.715]  The whites are just too stupid.
[03:09:25.715 --> 03:09:31.037]  In India, one of the most racist places in the world, where they worship white people.
[03:09:31.037 --> 03:09:31.838]  In the caste system.
[03:09:31.838 --> 03:09:33.478]  And I don't think that's a good thing.
[03:09:33.478 --> 03:09:37.299]  But you go to India, the ruling class is white.
[03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:38.840]  I mean, I'm gonna throw up, man.
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:40.660]  I can't handle this crap anymore.
[03:09:40.660 --> 03:09:44.502]  I mean, you've got this monster Hillary Clinton.
[03:09:45.438 --> 03:09:51.263]  That if they'd have run a smart, patriotic woman, she would have beaten Trump.
[03:09:51.263 --> 03:09:59.952]  But despite all of it, they force-fed us this monster of corruption.
[03:09:59.952 --> 03:10:02.894]  Let's go to Millie's Handmaid's Tale from the start.
[03:10:02.894 --> 03:10:04.096]  This is her breakdown.
[03:10:04.096 --> 03:10:04.396]  Here it is.
[03:10:09.716 --> 03:10:13.298]  Today at South by Southwest around 1230 p.m.
[03:10:13.298 --> 03:10:18.461]  there's going to be a Handmaid's Tale panel called what if Roe had to go.
[03:10:18.461 --> 03:10:33.168]  Essentially what happens if no longer there are abortion rights laws that can allow these women who want to have multiple abortions for even up until full term to continue to have abortions.
[03:10:33.168 --> 03:10:36.210]  The Handmaid's Tale is essentially to make it so that
[03:10:36.730 --> 03:10:41.274]  Motherhood, having babies, is seen as a burden, it's seen as force.
[03:10:41.274 --> 03:10:45.718]  These feminists believed what would happen if the laws were to come into action.
[03:10:45.718 --> 03:10:54.305]  The whole point of this right here, this show, this panel, this image right here for people to see when they're walking by, is to
[03:10:54.565 --> 03:11:10.417]  To suggest and subliminally put it out there that there is a battle of the sexes and that essentially all men, all masculinity is bad, is oppressing women, but they don't want to talk about the women in the Middle East that are being oppressed.
[03:11:10.417 --> 03:11:17.923]  No, they'll help support the Muslim Middle East culture that wants to infringe on women's rights in the Middle East.
[03:11:17.923 --> 03:11:19.024]  I want to point out this right here.
[03:11:19.024 --> 03:11:20.125]  Resist, sister.
[03:11:20.125 --> 03:11:21.846]  Resist is a common
[03:11:23.207 --> 03:11:26.548]  Obviously it's used with a lot of Black Lives Matter and Tifa.
[03:11:26.548 --> 03:11:30.209]  This is a call to resist Trump to women.
[03:11:30.209 --> 03:11:47.974]  This is a call for feminists and women to come together because, see, they're trying to let all the women know that, hey, these men are trying to oppress you and force you to have babies and force you to, you know, because that's what this whole show is about, is about women that are in a dystopic future and they're forced to have babies.
[03:11:47.974 --> 03:11:49.615]  And they're forced to be oppressed.
[03:11:50.015 --> 03:11:53.017]  And in truth, the globalists just want you as their slaves.
[03:11:53.017 --> 03:11:54.798]  They don't want you totally isolated.
[03:11:54.798 --> 03:11:56.138]  Continue.
[03:11:56.138 --> 03:11:59.420]  Ultra conservative patriarchy.
[03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:08.685]  It's almost as if they're saying that motherhood isn't powerful enough and that in a sense that by being a mother, by being a wife, you're essentially being a slave.
[03:12:08.685 --> 03:12:14.588]  When what they don't talk about is how women are actually being manipulated by the abortion systems every single day.
[03:12:14.588 --> 03:12:19.051]  The abortion systems, what they'll do is they'll take in a woman and they will hit her at the most vulnerable spots.
[03:12:19.491 --> 03:12:27.194]  You know, they'll make her feel as if she's not good enough to be a mother, as if she's not fit enough for anything that she wants to do, that she can't handle the world unless she gets an abortion.
[03:12:27.194 --> 03:12:27.635]  Exactly!
[03:12:27.635 --> 03:12:28.375]  That's what they do.
[03:12:28.375 --> 03:12:31.816]  They don't offer a real choice, usually when you go to an abortion clinic.
[03:12:31.816 --> 03:12:32.457]  They make it empowerment.
[03:12:32.457 --> 03:12:33.837]  They don't give you a choice.
[03:12:33.837 --> 03:12:40.760]  They don't say, hey, we're going to help you with your female gynecological issues.
[03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:45.843]  If you want to go in and you want to get ultrasounds, if you need maternity care, they don't offer maternity care.
[03:12:45.843 --> 03:12:49.004]  They don't tell you there's people willing to pay for the baby legally, hundreds of thousands.
[03:12:49.404 --> 03:12:52.465]  Are they just for pro-abortion?
[03:12:52.465 --> 03:12:58.027]  Okay, so notice here you have a sign that says concealed handguns prohibited.
[03:12:58.027 --> 03:13:03.448]  You also have openly carried handguns being prohibited as well.
[03:13:03.448 --> 03:13:10.951]  And this is a little fenced-in area which inside is the venue for bulletproof a coffee and
[03:13:11.411 --> 03:13:12.472]  We're good to go.
[03:13:31.615 --> 03:13:34.316]  Uh, free of guns, free of the Second Amendment.
[03:13:34.316 --> 03:13:48.441]  Do you really think that if you had a coffee maker that was, you know, say, to have a name that was pro-Second Amendment, for example, do you think that they would be permitted to have a venue here at South by Southwest?
[03:13:48.441 --> 03:14:00.266]  Well, I highly doubt it, because pretty much all of the venues and everything that we've been seeing here at South by Southwest has a very extreme liberal bias in everything they do.
[03:14:02.043 --> 03:14:03.484]  Oh yeah, it's like Bubble Boy.
[03:14:03.484 --> 03:14:07.126]  Or like, almost like a hamster wheel, or a hamster ball, I'm sorry.
[03:14:07.126 --> 03:14:07.566]  That's crazy.
[03:14:07.566 --> 03:14:09.647]  Keeping us going in the same pace, same time.
[03:14:09.647 --> 03:14:12.269]  That's like in the Prisoner, the big bubbles that chase you down.
[03:14:12.269 --> 03:14:16.551]  This technology is going to keep us on the hamster wheel, if you will.
[03:14:16.551 --> 03:14:21.814]  By the way, we always create different flags for our events because the left will beat even women up.
[03:14:21.814 --> 03:14:23.375]  So you can't go out in these areas.
[03:14:23.375 --> 03:14:24.156]  What car to go?
[03:14:24.953 --> 03:14:29.820]  It's all membership based and you just use your app to unlock the car and drive.
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:31.822]  And you can park anywhere you want within the home area.
[03:14:33.499 --> 03:14:34.120]  That's interesting.
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:44.750]  So essentially, it kind of is like a rental car, but instead you subscribe to a membership where you can use any different car.
[03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:48.054]  You don't get charged extra for different cars and you have a monthly rate.
[03:14:48.054 --> 03:14:49.135]  Is that what it is?
[03:14:49.135 --> 03:14:49.935]  No monthly rate.
[03:14:49.935 --> 03:14:52.398]  It's just per use, you only get charged for what you use.
[03:14:52.398 --> 03:14:55.021]  So are these cars just going to be parked around cities?
[03:14:55.021 --> 03:14:55.961]  That you can just hop into?
[03:14:55.961 --> 03:14:57.123]  Kind of how those bicycles are?
[03:14:57.603 --> 03:14:58.823]  Yep, exactly.
[03:14:58.823 --> 03:15:08.766]  So, I mean, what do you guys think about how this is kind of like phasing out car ownership in a way?
[03:15:08.766 --> 03:15:13.187]  Like, if everyone just starts doing this, people aren't going to be owning cars anymore.
[03:15:13.187 --> 03:15:14.447]  That's the point.
[03:15:14.447 --> 03:15:15.787]  That's the point?
[03:15:15.787 --> 03:15:16.308]  That's the point.
[03:15:18.274 --> 03:15:22.156]  So we think there's more benefit out of people sharing cars and not having cars just sitting in the driveway.
[03:15:22.156 --> 03:15:23.197]  They think it's more benefit.
[03:15:23.197 --> 03:15:25.698]  Not being used for 90% of the day.
[03:15:25.698 --> 03:15:27.559]  Yeah, car to go is a complete joke.
[03:15:27.559 --> 03:15:29.340]  Alright, that report's very diverse.
[03:15:29.340 --> 03:15:31.141]  It's in a whole bunch of different subjects.
[03:15:31.141 --> 03:15:35.023]  I don't mean diverse in the LibTard version, but a lot of different angles.
[03:15:35.023 --> 03:15:38.124]  You can see the full report at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:15:38.124 --> 03:15:38.925]  When we return...
[03:15:40.405 --> 03:15:45.491]  The Morning Joe flips out that America's waking up to the deep state.
[03:15:45.491 --> 03:15:47.714]  All that and more straight ahead.
[03:15:47.714 --> 03:15:49.296]  This is The Infowar.
[03:15:55.209 --> 03:15:57.691]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[03:15:57.691 --> 03:15:59.533]  They may look the same on the outside.
[03:15:59.533 --> 03:16:00.293]  They're stylish.
[03:16:00.293 --> 03:16:01.955]  They'll hold your cards and cash.
[03:16:01.955 --> 03:16:04.937]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[03:16:04.937 --> 03:16:07.179]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[03:16:07.179 --> 03:16:09.561]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[03:16:09.561 --> 03:16:11.663]  But it does have magical powers.
[03:16:12.203 --> 03:16:17.888]  ID Stronghold wallets protect your critical information and identity from thieves standing right next to you.

[03:18:06.563 --> 03:18:15.070]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:18:15.070 --> 03:18:23.877]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:18:25.953 --> 03:18:45.547]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:45.547 --> 03:18:48.229]  It is amazing!
[03:18:48.229 --> 03:18:53.193]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:18:55.106 --> 03:18:58.710]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:18:58.710 --> 03:19:00.471]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:19:00.471 --> 03:19:11.762]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:19:12.623 --> 03:19:21.729]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:19:21.729 --> 03:19:27.453]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:19:27.453 --> 03:19:32.776]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:19:32.776 --> 03:19:35.398]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:19:35.398 --> 03:19:37.099]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:19:37.099 --> 03:19:41.922]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[03:19:42.142 --> 03:19:44.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:20.811 --> 03:20:24.873]  Well folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[03:20:24.873 --> 03:20:28.094]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:20:28.094 --> 03:20:29.895]  And we are here.
[03:20:29.895 --> 03:20:33.116]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:33.116 --> 03:20:39.338]  Reddit user says he's Austin bombing killer.
[03:20:39.338 --> 03:20:41.439]  And it's probably made up.
[03:20:41.439 --> 03:20:42.840]  Probably not the killer.
[03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:47.201]  But this person says they were planning to bomb us today.
[03:20:47.201 --> 03:20:48.142]  Shipping the package.
[03:20:49.366 --> 03:20:52.908]  From San Antonio to our offices.
[03:20:52.908 --> 03:20:59.193]  And that it must have detonated or had the switch thrown by being bounced.
[03:20:59.193 --> 03:21:02.355]  And from the police, these are pressure bombs.
[03:21:02.355 --> 03:21:04.316]  But we've already reported that, so this individual would know that.
[03:21:04.316 --> 03:21:05.197]  Who knows?
[03:21:05.197 --> 03:21:07.518]  I would not report it.
[03:21:07.518 --> 03:21:12.121]  Except that it's been picked up by the New York Daily News.
[03:21:12.121 --> 03:21:14.283]  So document Kim, shot please.
[03:21:14.283 --> 03:21:16.664]  For TV viewers.
[03:21:16.664 --> 03:21:17.465]  And you can see here.
[03:21:20.151 --> 03:21:22.793]  Where they get into all that.
[03:21:22.793 --> 03:21:24.574]  So this is just all part of the hysteria.
[03:21:24.574 --> 03:21:32.500]  It's just like folks think they're going to win some Powerball ticket where people bought 20 million tickets.
[03:21:32.500 --> 03:21:34.942]  Or 100 million tickets in some cases.
[03:21:34.942 --> 03:21:37.664]  And then everybody just thinks when those balls start rolling they can get it.
[03:21:37.664 --> 03:21:46.170]  Statistically, you could have the German Air Force flying over here with a bunch of German bombers and dropping thousands and thousands of pounds of bombs.
[03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:51.592]  Tens of thousands of pounds of bombs, and it would still only kill a fraction of the city.
[03:21:51.592 --> 03:21:55.875]  You got more people dying every week in car wrecks in Austin than, you know, or dying in a month from these bombings.
[03:21:55.875 --> 03:21:56.776]  But it's still serious.
[03:21:56.776 --> 03:21:59.918]  I'm not taking away from that if it blows your head off or blows your arms off.
[03:21:59.918 --> 03:22:04.281]  It's just, it creates this lottery ticket idea.
[03:22:04.281 --> 03:22:09.565]  But the negative way, like, you think if you own a ticket, it's probably going to be you.
[03:22:09.565 --> 03:22:11.907]  Even though it's, it's, the odds are incredibly
[03:22:14.355 --> 03:22:15.276]  Huge.
[03:22:15.276 --> 03:22:16.957]  You still have that perception.
[03:22:16.957 --> 03:22:27.344]  Just like great white sharks kill 6, 7, 8 people a year on average, people still tell you, I don't like to swim in the deep ocean or I don't like to go off the shore, I'm afraid a great white's going to eat me because of the movie Jaws.
[03:22:27.344 --> 03:22:34.469]  And for years after that movie came out in 1972, in California and New England and other areas, they saw
[03:22:35.822 --> 03:22:46.775]  Up to 50% reductions in people getting beach houses and going out in the water and people going out and fishing because they just thought there were great whites out there to eat them.
[03:22:46.775 --> 03:22:48.457]  Even though it's one of the rarest ways to die.
[03:22:49.375 --> 03:22:53.656]  So, this has created hysteria.
[03:22:53.656 --> 03:22:57.476]  It's what terrorism does.
[03:22:57.476 --> 03:22:58.857]  It's what it's designed to do.
[03:22:58.857 --> 03:23:06.558]  And generally, it's a mental patient type, schizophrenic type, that has an education.
[03:23:06.558 --> 03:23:10.279]  Or it's somebody that wants to get attention, usually a leftist.
[03:23:10.279 --> 03:23:11.299]  That's what most of these people are.
[03:23:11.299 --> 03:23:14.259]  Theodor Kaczynski, the Unabomber, you name it.
[03:23:14.259 --> 03:23:18.200]  Paul Watson gets in an article pointing out that Netflix has a hit show.
[03:23:19.409 --> 03:23:23.473]  About the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski kind of glorifying him.
[03:23:23.473 --> 03:23:26.756]  And if you say the CIA is involved, people say, oh get your tinfoil hat.
[03:23:26.756 --> 03:23:28.097]  That's another way to just end debate.
[03:23:28.097 --> 03:23:29.859]  I'm not saying the CIA is doing this.
[03:23:29.859 --> 03:23:34.643]  The CIA is a very diverse, big, bureaucratic organization.
[03:23:34.643 --> 03:23:37.046]  But criminal groups use that secrecy to operate.
[03:23:38.248 --> 03:23:49.382]  But, if you do think it's Kaczynski related, as an ode to Kaczynski, as a love letter, as a copycat, then you gotta bring in the CIA, because Theodore Kaczynski...
[03:23:52.807 --> 03:23:58.728]  He volunteered for the CIA in college and disappeared into the MKUltra project.
[03:23:58.728 --> 03:23:59.908]  That's on record!
[03:23:59.908 --> 03:24:03.189]  LA Times, Associated Press.
[03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:07.410]  And so, we're not saying that's the CIA.
[03:24:07.410 --> 03:24:10.190]  We're not saying it's leftists that are doing it.
[03:24:10.190 --> 03:24:20.692]  We're saying, historically, unless you're talking about islamicists, it's the same category, cowards, it's the left that do most of the bombings.
[03:24:21.772 --> 03:24:23.072]  You could say, well, look what McVeigh did.
[03:24:23.072 --> 03:24:25.893]  Well, I know the names of the feds that carried out the bombing.
[03:24:25.893 --> 03:24:28.134]  I know the names of all the people involved.
[03:24:28.134 --> 03:24:30.234]  It came out in court documents.
[03:24:30.234 --> 03:24:35.176]  I've talked to the cop of the year's family and everybody was tortured to death because he saw who did it.
[03:24:35.176 --> 03:24:36.796]  It wasn't McVeigh.
[03:24:36.796 --> 03:24:43.358]  But look at the Weathermen underground and all the communist groups and Patty Hearst and on and on and on.
[03:24:43.358 --> 03:24:44.299]  It's what communists do.
[03:24:44.299 --> 03:24:46.779]  It's what cowards do.
[03:24:46.779 --> 03:24:48.780]  So, I'm not saying that she's done this.
[03:24:49.949 --> 03:24:53.010]  I'm saying we have a historical fact from what we've seen in the past.
[03:24:53.010 --> 03:25:16.537]  Now, the fact that we even have something called a deep state, that just means the bureaucracies, the entrenched, unelected bureaucracy, and that interfaces with the shadow government, which was set up legitimately for continuity of government during nuclear war, asteroid strikes, or other systems that knock out the legitimate elected government.
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:23.466]  You then have a COG that is the shadow government.
[03:25:23.466 --> 03:25:27.551]  That's the term used in parlance for 50 years.
[03:25:27.551 --> 03:25:35.541]  That then interfaces with the bureaucracy and the leftist arms of the deep state, which is pretty much the entire deep state is leftist, about 80%.
[03:25:38.044 --> 03:25:45.069]  They're now lashing out on America, lashing out at Christians, lashing out at Trump, lashing out at prosperity, not because they're communists.
[03:25:45.069 --> 03:25:53.414]  They want the average person to be a slave on a chicken feed diet, enough to just barely let them survive, so they can play God.
[03:25:53.414 --> 03:25:56.997]  It's a very beta group of cowardly scum.
[03:25:58.772 --> 03:26:15.218]  Directed by a very small, cloistered group of billionaires and elites that want a monopoly system so they can have delusions of grandeur and have a breakaway civilization, livestock technologies, and of course, do what Pinky and the Brain always talks about, the same thing they always talk about, ruling the world.
[03:26:16.437 --> 03:26:18.159]  So that's how this works.
[03:26:18.159 --> 03:26:23.323]  That's the real system, and they hate me, because they sit around and they go, nobody ever listens to that guy.
[03:26:23.323 --> 03:26:26.946]  He doesn't have a foppish NPR accent.
[03:26:26.946 --> 03:26:28.587]  Boom, they start listening.
[03:26:28.587 --> 03:26:30.949]  Well, what do we do?
[03:26:30.949 --> 03:26:34.232]  Because if they keep listening to him, it's all over.
[03:26:34.232 --> 03:26:35.834]  So here's the Morning Joe.
[03:26:37.927 --> 03:26:43.134]  Flipping out that people are learning about the deep state.
[03:26:43.134 --> 03:26:47.460]  They sound the alarm that people think there's a deep state.
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:51.866]  And they think the sun comes up and they think blood once it's oxygenated is red.
[03:26:51.866 --> 03:26:52.847]  Here it is.
[03:26:55.609 --> 03:26:57.671]  in that part may not have criminal exposure.
[03:26:57.671 --> 03:26:59.573]  Or he could be on to something.
[03:26:59.573 --> 03:27:05.818]  Attacks against the so-called deep state by the president and some Republicans may be taking hold.
[03:27:05.818 --> 03:27:12.424]  More Americans now believe that national policy is being manipulated or directed by a deep state.
[03:27:12.424 --> 03:27:15.086]  That according to the newest Monmouth University poll.
[03:27:15.086 --> 03:27:17.549]  Six in ten Americans believe
[03:27:18.129 --> 03:27:24.433]  That unelected or appointed government officials have too much influence in determining federal policy.
[03:27:24.433 --> 03:27:34.539]  26% say the right balance of power exists between elected and unelected officials, while this view of the deep state looks to be growing more prevalent.
[03:27:34.539 --> 03:27:43.364]  Only 13% of Americans are very familiar with the term, 24% are somewhat familiar, and 63% said they are not familiar.
[03:27:43.364 --> 03:27:47.366]  However, when Monmouth described the term as, quote, a group of
[03:27:47.566 --> 03:27:54.588]  Unelected government and military officials who secretly manipulate or direct national policy.
[03:27:54.588 --> 03:27:59.870]  Nearly three in four Americans said they believe that the deep state exists.
[03:27:59.870 --> 03:28:02.370]  One in five said it does not.
[03:28:02.370 --> 03:28:05.591]  And I think of the Facebook story and Cambridge Analytics that we're covering.
[03:28:05.591 --> 03:28:07.852]  We'll be doing a lot more on that later.
[03:28:07.852 --> 03:28:11.693]  But Carol Lee, this is real.
[03:28:11.693 --> 03:28:14.774]  And this president may be on to something, whether it's right or wrong.
[03:28:15.194 --> 03:28:27.042]  This is, I can't, I don't think you can look at that any other way than that it's a direct result of what we've seen the president try to do, which is sow doubt about people in the administration, whether it's the FBI.
[03:28:27.042 --> 03:28:28.803]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[03:28:28.803 --> 03:28:30.944]  Look, everybody knows there's dug-in bureaucracies.
[03:28:30.944 --> 03:28:34.607]  You got Schumer on TV going, the bureaucracy will take the president out.
[03:28:34.607 --> 03:28:37.208]  You got Mudd saying it's going to kill him.
[03:28:37.208 --> 03:28:38.749]  You better, threatening everybody.
[03:28:38.749 --> 03:28:41.031]  You idiots can't have it both ways.
[03:28:41.031 --> 03:28:42.452]  You've declared a war on America.
[03:28:43.112 --> 03:28:46.239]  And now America has declared war on you.
[03:28:46.239 --> 03:28:47.863]  So, let's go!
[03:28:47.863 --> 03:28:49.146]  Let's bang heads!
[03:28:49.146 --> 03:28:50.048]  Let's do it!
[03:28:50.048 --> 03:28:50.770]  You want it?
[03:28:50.770 --> 03:28:51.531]  We're coming!
[03:28:51.531 --> 03:28:52.353]  Nothing's gonna stop us now!
[03:28:53.942 --> 03:28:56.564]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.

[03:29:54.844 --> 03:29:55.785]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:29:55.785 --> 03:29:56.345]  Good, brother.
[03:29:56.345 --> 03:29:58.066]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:29:58.066 --> 03:30:00.028]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:30:00.028 --> 03:30:04.070]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:06.672]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:30:06.672 --> 03:30:09.094]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:30:09.094 --> 03:30:16.939]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[03:30:22.045 --> 03:30:25.088]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:30:25.088 --> 03:30:26.730]  They've made a ton of money there.
[03:30:26.730 --> 03:30:32.056]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:30:32.076 --> 03:30:34.698]  Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide.

[03:30:57.692 --> 03:30:59.636]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:30:59.636 --> 03:31:09.012]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:31:09.808 --> 03:31:16.592]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:31:16.592 --> 03:31:18.973]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:31:18.973 --> 03:31:19.894]  Thank you.
[03:31:19.894 --> 03:31:22.395]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:31:22.395 --> 03:31:26.718]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:31:26.718 --> 03:31:29.739]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:31:29.739 --> 03:31:31.060]  They are quality.
[03:31:31.060 --> 03:31:32.781]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:31:32.781 --> 03:31:35.683]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.

[03:31:36.723 --> 03:31:54.656]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

[03:32:57.930 --> 03:33:00.554]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:18.658 --> 03:33:24.582]  You know, I was just looking at DrugsReport.com
[03:33:38.160 --> 03:33:41.221]  And I was looking at just how crazy all the headlines are.
[03:33:41.221 --> 03:33:44.661]  Not from a sensationalist perspective, just because that's what's happening in the news.
[03:33:44.661 --> 03:33:47.142]  Austin gripped by fifth bombing.
[03:33:47.142 --> 03:33:52.783]  Experts look at it being a Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski copycat.
[03:33:52.783 --> 03:34:01.585]  And then right next to it, man faces year in prison for Hitler dog joke.
[03:34:01.585 --> 03:34:04.986]  And then what's even weirder is both articles are ours.
[03:34:04.986 --> 03:34:05.966]  And both articles are true.
[03:34:09.011 --> 03:34:10.452]  And it's all unfolding.
[03:34:10.452 --> 03:34:12.574]  It's crazy.
[03:34:12.574 --> 03:34:26.784]  Meanwhile, the Hill, McCain rips Trump for congratulating Putin on his election as an insult to the Russian people.
[03:34:26.784 --> 03:34:30.406]  And that's the only reason I covered this thing earlier, the whole Politburo and the rest of it.
[03:34:30.406 --> 03:34:31.267]  Let me just do that now.
[03:34:33.618 --> 03:34:38.781]  No, let me do it next segment, because I had a bunch of guests on, and now I can't find my stack of Politburo news.
[03:34:38.781 --> 03:34:46.265]  I want to show Russia's electoral system versus China's, and just point out that that's not the case.
[03:34:46.265 --> 03:34:48.087]  Russia is not a dictatorship.
[03:34:48.087 --> 03:34:52.349]  And that's just because it's a fact!
[03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:56.532]  China is, and then our media won't call it a dictatorship.
[03:34:56.532 --> 03:35:01.014]  And it gives me a headache.
[03:35:01.014 --> 03:35:02.255]  You know what else gives me a headache?
[03:35:07.702 --> 03:35:09.642]  Constantly not being able to find my video list.
[03:35:09.642 --> 03:35:11.023]  Can you guys bring me another video list in here?
[03:35:11.023 --> 03:35:15.244]  Because I want to go over the videos and I was just digging through stuff and can't find it.
[03:35:15.244 --> 03:35:15.944]  Just bring me a video list.
[03:35:15.944 --> 03:35:17.764]  Thank you.
[03:35:17.764 --> 03:35:21.585]  I'll tell you what else gives me a headache.
[03:35:21.585 --> 03:35:26.326]  That's people that continue to say we need free health care.
[03:35:26.326 --> 03:35:27.106]  Thank you.
[03:35:27.106 --> 03:35:32.347]  We need free health care just like they got in England or in Cuba.
[03:35:32.347 --> 03:35:35.728]  It works perfectly.
[03:35:35.728 --> 03:35:37.108]  So I can get my plastic surgery.
[03:35:38.214 --> 03:35:45.242]  Only thing you get free in England is a sex change, because they want your weenie cut off, because they don't want to have you having any kids.
[03:35:45.242 --> 03:35:50.569]  Seriously.
[03:35:50.569 --> 03:35:55.514]  I mean, Paul Watson had a cold for like two months, was about to die, and they wouldn't even let him get antibiotics.
[03:35:56.465 --> 03:36:00.126]  He had to get permission to go to a private doctor from the National Health Service.
[03:36:00.126 --> 03:36:00.966]  He has the money.
[03:36:00.966 --> 03:36:02.546]  They have a two-tiered system.
[03:36:02.546 --> 03:36:04.607]  How am I even going to get into it?
[03:36:04.607 --> 03:36:07.507]  It's like, look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at North Korea.
[03:36:07.507 --> 03:36:09.328]  Good Lord!
[03:36:09.328 --> 03:36:13.589]  You know Canadians come here to have their surgeries, right?
[03:36:13.589 --> 03:36:18.830]  And that doesn't mean we are perfect people.
[03:36:21.738 --> 03:36:24.400]  But compared, our system's incredible.
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:25.020]  I know all about it.
[03:36:25.020 --> 03:36:26.982]  My dad's been in medical management my whole life.
[03:36:26.982 --> 03:36:30.084]  By the way, a lot of the crew just Googles what I say.
[03:36:30.084 --> 03:36:31.305]  As they find out, I'm telling them the truth.
[03:36:31.305 --> 03:36:32.226]  It sounds crazy.
[03:36:32.226 --> 03:36:33.367]  Put that back up, please.
[03:36:33.367 --> 03:36:35.308]  Good job finding that so quick.
[03:36:35.308 --> 03:36:38.330]  A lot of states won't pay for a sex change.
[03:36:38.330 --> 03:36:40.812]  And it's not because I want to hurt your feelings.
[03:36:40.812 --> 03:36:43.074]  You want to cut your arm off.
[03:36:43.074 --> 03:36:45.415]  You know, use a meat cleaver.
[03:36:45.415 --> 03:36:47.217]  I shouldn't have to pay for your medical bills.
[03:36:47.217 --> 03:36:47.777]  Same thing.
[03:36:47.777 --> 03:36:50.019]  You want to go have your genitals turned inside out?
[03:36:51.212 --> 03:36:57.000]  And all the rest of it, and say you're a purple, one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater, or whatever you want to be.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:57.781]  That's your life.
[03:36:57.781 --> 03:36:58.902]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:36:58.902 --> 03:37:00.104]  Yeah, but there's the headline.
[03:37:00.104 --> 03:37:04.170]  So people that can't get free sex changes here?
[03:37:04.170 --> 03:37:05.231]  Well, where do they go?
[03:37:05.231 --> 03:37:06.653]  They go to the UK.
[03:37:06.653 --> 03:37:08.596]  Now, how discriminatory is that?
[03:37:11.994 --> 03:37:13.975]  How discriminatory is that?
[03:37:13.975 --> 03:37:20.558]  Transgender American woman, 25, who cannot afford gender reassignment surgery is in the U.S.
[03:37:20.558 --> 03:37:21.339]  moving to the U.K.
[03:37:21.339 --> 03:37:22.659]  for a free operation.
[03:37:22.659 --> 03:37:26.641]  Because it's a man that says it's a woman, so they even put that up there.
[03:37:26.641 --> 03:37:33.985]  And then they go further, you can't afford it, well don't worry, Tavistock Institute that launched this whole brave new world.
[03:37:33.985 --> 03:37:37.326]  It's gonna happen.
[03:37:37.326 --> 03:37:40.328]  Now imagine, and I've watched C-SPAN where they have
[03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:45.518]  Prime Minister's questions on the Parliament.
[03:37:45.518 --> 03:37:51.149]  And I remember watching Tony Blair, and I remember watching John Major, and I remember watching all these guys get up there.
[03:37:53.078 --> 03:38:01.904]  And they would, they would say, in this area of Suffolk's, young Billy Johnson waited two years for brain surgery and by then he died.
[03:38:01.904 --> 03:38:06.567]  The surgery was 98% operable in the first six months, but he waited.
[03:38:06.567 --> 03:38:11.890]  And then the Prime Minister would go, I understand what you're saying, yes it's too long, we need more funding, get that fixed.
[03:38:11.890 --> 03:38:12.951]  And then someone else would get up.
[03:38:12.951 --> 03:38:14.772]  I mean, these are real cases by the thousands.
[03:38:14.772 --> 03:38:18.535]  So I'm going to explain this to you.
[03:38:18.535 --> 03:38:19.115]  You are a
[03:38:20.695 --> 03:38:33.361]  Six-year-old little boy with an operable brain tumor that they could snip off if it doesn't grow too much bigger and you are going to get put six feet in the ground, Jack.
[03:38:33.361 --> 03:38:43.446]  But if you want to go over there and have some abusive whack job doctor take taxpayer money and chop somebody's genitals.
[03:38:43.446 --> 03:38:44.947]  That's what the left loves it.
[03:38:44.947 --> 03:38:47.228]  Islam's cutting women's genitals off.
[03:38:49.424 --> 03:38:52.707]  It's like demon world, man.
[03:38:52.707 --> 03:38:55.290]  It's demon world.
[03:38:55.290 --> 03:38:57.472]  Mutilate yourself, we'll pay for it.
[03:38:57.472 --> 03:39:06.061]  And then if I say you're mutilating yourself, I bet you terminally ill boy, denied potentially life-saving treatment by NHS, would be given it at any US hospital.
[03:39:06.061 --> 03:39:06.782]  But let's stop there.
[03:39:08.695 --> 03:39:13.676]  I'm just sick of hearing about how great it is.
[03:39:13.676 --> 03:39:21.338]  I remember sitting there in college, I went two years, and it was the most dumbed down dribble in every class, no matter what it was.
[03:39:21.338 --> 03:39:26.579]  They'd go, I have a friend in the Foreign Service.
[03:39:26.579 --> 03:39:33.261]  Did you know in Cuba, it's always like an American accent, but they try to anglicize it like NPR.
[03:39:33.261 --> 03:39:37.282]  Did you know that one in ten is a doctor in Cuba?
[03:39:37.282 --> 03:39:38.102]  Education's free.
[03:39:39.187 --> 03:39:41.769]  It's incredible, and we're going to have that here.
[03:39:41.769 --> 03:39:44.610]  Now, let me tell you about fundamentally how evil white people are.
[03:39:44.610 --> 03:39:47.072]  Here is an image of a woman of the future.
[03:39:47.072 --> 03:39:53.876]  She is brown, she is not white, she is not black, but one people... And then it was just like, oh my god, the next class, it didn't matter.
[03:39:53.876 --> 03:39:56.898]  I thought, well that's anthropology, or that's psychology, no.
[03:39:56.898 --> 03:40:01.161]  It was the mathematics classes, it was everything.
[03:40:01.161 --> 03:40:04.583]  Except for one mathematics class where the lady was actually from Africa.
[03:40:06.587 --> 03:40:12.509]  And she was like, all these leftists need to actually go to Africa and see what it's like, and all the stuff you hear at this university, all this leftist stuff.
[03:40:12.509 --> 03:40:15.190]  And he's like, I'm not even a conservative, but let me tell you something.
[03:40:15.190 --> 03:40:27.055]  This America-hating crap, the whole things you hear, it's communism, and it's what's brought down the country I came from, and all of you that are leftist, you need to go to Africa before you listen to these people.
[03:40:27.055 --> 03:40:28.096]  And I remember that lady.
[03:40:28.096 --> 03:40:28.756]  She was an African.
[03:40:34.867 --> 03:40:38.408]  And she was freaked out.
[03:40:38.408 --> 03:40:42.970]  So, these universities are mad houses.
[03:40:42.970 --> 03:40:45.190]  They're mad houses.
[03:40:45.190 --> 03:40:49.812]  And the more money government puts into healthcare, it drives down the quality, it drives up the price.
[03:40:49.812 --> 03:40:55.053]  That's what it does when Obama goes, we're gonna make everybody buy insurance.
[03:40:55.053 --> 03:40:55.753]  What do you think?
[03:40:55.753 --> 03:40:58.454]  The price is tripled.
[03:40:58.454 --> 03:41:01.455]  Of course it does.
[03:41:01.455 --> 03:41:03.656]  If the government said, you've gotta buy,
[03:41:07.322 --> 03:41:08.803]  X car.
[03:41:08.803 --> 03:41:10.403]  What are the sellers of that car going to do?
[03:41:10.403 --> 03:41:13.205]  They're going to up the price.
[03:41:13.205 --> 03:41:15.466]  Plus it's going to drive up demand.
[03:41:15.466 --> 03:41:18.427]  So, it's the same deal ladies and gentlemen.
[03:41:18.427 --> 03:41:22.549]  Can you imagine people that are actually from Africa and they get here and it's the best lemon they've ever had?
[03:41:23.649 --> 03:41:26.910]  And everybody's running around, bitching and complaining and hating everything?
[03:41:26.910 --> 03:41:32.312]  That's why I run into Africans that are taxi drivers or whatever, or people that I've met working at a hotel or whatever.
[03:41:32.312 --> 03:41:33.852]  They're like, oh, I like you, Alex.
[03:41:33.852 --> 03:41:35.273]  Oh, I know what you're saying is right.
[03:41:35.273 --> 03:41:38.754]  My family in Nigeria was blown up by Muslims 10 years ago.
[03:41:38.754 --> 03:41:39.674]  My brother was killed.
[03:41:39.674 --> 03:41:40.415]  You're right.
[03:41:40.415 --> 03:41:41.455]  God bless President Trump.
[03:41:43.683 --> 03:41:49.827]  At least he's spoiled rotten American blacks, spoiled rotten American whites, all bitching with their smartphones and fancy jeans and everything.
[03:41:49.827 --> 03:41:52.909]  The poorest person's got more than anybody in most other countries bitching.
[03:41:52.909 --> 03:41:54.450]  Yeah, screw this country.
[03:41:54.450 --> 03:41:56.951]  Yeah, whatever, man.
[03:41:56.951 --> 03:41:58.492]  Fascist crap.
[03:41:58.492 --> 03:42:00.193]  Right-wing people.
[03:42:00.193 --> 03:42:09.779]  Yeah, you know, white privilege.
[03:42:09.779 --> 03:42:11.019]  Christians failed Africa, though.
[03:42:11.019 --> 03:42:13.201]  Christians went in there, built industry.
[03:42:14.531 --> 03:42:20.814]  Exploited a lot of stuff, but the population exploded because there was medicine and stuff, and then now it's out of control.
[03:42:20.814 --> 03:42:31.938]  I mean, Africa's population, depending on what numbers you look at, it's like a hundred times what it was 300 years ago.
[03:42:31.938 --> 03:42:36.160]  But the leaders are corrupt.
[03:42:37.841 --> 03:42:47.224]  And the people try to come here to get away from that, and the left is waiting, preying on them to get control of them and run their lives and recreate the hell they came from right here.
[03:42:47.224 --> 03:42:49.165]  Other big clips, other big news, straight ahead.
[03:42:49.165 --> 03:42:54.086]  Stay with us.
[03:42:54.086 --> 03:42:56.407]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:42:56.407 --> 03:42:58.568]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:42:58.568 --> 03:43:01.389]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:02.503 --> 03:43:14.007]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:14.007 --> 03:43:23.110]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:29.376]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:43:29.376 --> 03:43:34.822]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:43:34.822 --> 03:43:37.084]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:37.084 --> 03:43:39.106]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:43:39.967 --> 03:43:43.390]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:43.390 --> 03:43:45.411]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:45.411 --> 03:43:48.714]  We sold it at 50% off, till it sold out.
[03:43:48.714 --> 03:43:51.256]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:51.256 --> 03:43:53.898]  Get yours today, mfolwareslife.com.
[03:43:53.898 --> 03:43:59.302]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at mfolwarestore.com.
[03:43:59.302 --> 03:44:02.145]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:44:02.145 --> 03:44:04.126]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:44:04.126 --> 03:44:08.990]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:44:09.130 --> 03:44:11.231]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:44:11.231 --> 03:44:12.512]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:44:12.512 --> 03:44:17.636]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:44:17.636 --> 03:44:24.380]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:44:24.520 --> 03:44:31.203]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodides and the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:44:31.203 --> 03:44:38.106]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:44:38.106 --> 03:44:45.629]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[03:44:45.629 --> 03:44:53.392]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:44:54.775 --> 03:45:05.357]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:05.357 --> 03:45:07.417]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:07.417 --> 03:45:10.278]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:10.278 --> 03:45:11.778]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.778 --> 03:45:18.600]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:45:18.600 --> 03:45:19.860]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:45:20.680 --> 03:45:30.382]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:30.382 --> 03:45:47.205]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:47.205 --> 03:45:50.346]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:45:50.486 --> 03:45:54.789]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and Infowarslive.com.
[03:45:54.789 --> 03:45:57.811]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:45:57.811 --> 03:46:02.014]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:46:02.014 --> 03:46:08.718]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:46:08.718 --> 03:46:12.461]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:46:13.181 --> 03:46:33.255]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:33.255 --> 03:46:36.798]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:37.358 --> 03:46:48.582]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:48.582 --> 03:46:57.986]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:46:57.986 --> 03:47:00.647]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:11.713 --> 03:47:17.297]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:17.297 --> 03:47:25.223]  Oh, it's tell how Poncho fell.
[03:47:25.223 --> 03:47:29.145]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:47:29.145 --> 03:47:33.128]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:47:33.128 --> 03:47:37.091]  So the story ends, we're told.
[03:47:37.091 --> 03:47:39.453]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:47:44.123 --> 03:47:52.349]  All right, I've got some final stories to cover, and then O. Troyer, Roger Stone, and others take over with the War Room, always power-packed and informative.
[03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:55.171]  And remember, you know all this stuff.
[03:47:55.171 --> 03:47:59.435]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors are just now willing to wake up and see it.
[03:47:59.435 --> 03:48:06.580]  We're at the critical flashpoint, the turning point, the jump point, the event horizon, the crossroads, the fulcrum.
[03:48:07.588 --> 03:48:08.849]  The tipping point.
[03:48:08.849 --> 03:48:15.392]  And so that's why we need you more than ever to spread the word so we're not under the globalist dominion.
[03:48:15.392 --> 03:48:17.373]  Much of this for us is not even intellectual anymore.
[03:48:17.373 --> 03:48:18.274]  We've won that fight.
[03:48:18.274 --> 03:48:19.354]  We know the facts.
[03:48:19.354 --> 03:48:30.440]  It's now just about pushing the info, not bullying, not doing like the left does, but just putting out the truth and not bowing to their evil.
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:33.162]  They claim data mining was invented in 2013 by a guy with pink hair.
[03:48:36.886 --> 03:48:43.748]  Because he worked and is a whistleblower out of this analytics deal out in the UK.
[03:48:43.748 --> 03:48:48.490]  And the big crime was that Facebook just let conservative groups get in there and organize.
[03:48:48.490 --> 03:48:50.310]  That's all been shut down now.
[03:48:50.310 --> 03:48:54.312]  But they're trying to teach you that that's all that goes on and that it was just invented there.
[03:48:54.312 --> 03:48:55.252]  Because they think you're a moron.
[03:48:56.440 --> 03:48:57.880]  Utterly horrifying!
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:49:02.641]  Ex-Facebook insiders says covert data harvesting?
[03:49:02.641 --> 03:49:04.621]  Was it Chinese communists harvesting organs?
[03:49:04.621 --> 03:49:05.081]  Is that bad?
[03:49:05.081 --> 03:49:06.402]  Oh, no, of course not!
[03:49:06.402 --> 03:49:13.363]  No, I mean, I mean, covert data open source harvesting was routine!
[03:49:13.363 --> 03:49:16.103]  It must be banned off the big giants!
[03:49:16.103 --> 03:49:25.125]  Any communication, any talking to anyone, any organizing by anybody but the Facebook that the former head of the Obama campaign says that they owned and controlled
[03:49:25.865 --> 03:49:30.387]  It's just you can't allow it, you understand me?
[03:49:30.387 --> 03:49:34.749]  They think you're so stupid you don't get it.
[03:49:34.749 --> 03:49:40.511]  Now continuing, people are ready to buy some guns in the world's murder capital.
[03:49:40.511 --> 03:49:47.855]  Bloomberg has a big detailed report about how they have the highest crime rate in the world, even over Mexico.
[03:49:47.855 --> 03:49:53.677]  And it's because they have a total zero no-gun policy for over 50 years.
[03:49:53.677 --> 03:49:55.398]  And now the leading candidate to be president
[03:49:57.566 --> 03:49:57.646]  It's
[03:50:16.909 --> 03:50:24.034]  They understand what's going on, smart people, a lot of resources, really cool culture, but they've got no Second Amendment.
[03:50:24.034 --> 03:50:27.697]  And if you don't have that, you're going to have gangs in government ruling you, just like Mexico.
[03:50:27.697 --> 03:50:32.581]  I mean, it's an absolute fact that if Mexico put it out of the Second Amendment from the beginning, it'd be just like the U.S.
[03:50:32.581 --> 03:50:33.601]  Same thing with Brazil.
[03:50:33.601 --> 03:50:36.504]  Venezuela had one, Argentina kind of had one, that went away.
[03:50:36.504 --> 03:50:43.649]  The whole, the money, it's like opening a space store, a bulkhead in space, a portal, and like, the oxygen just went out.
[03:50:43.649 --> 03:50:45.991]  Well, wow, this really doesn't work too well.
[03:50:47.560 --> 03:50:49.681]  He wants to make it a citizen's right.
[03:50:49.681 --> 03:50:53.802]  Civilian gun ownership goes into gun control.
[03:50:53.802 --> 03:51:03.765]  And they talk about the overwhelming global tendency towards more restrictions of gun owners and how it's, you know, wrong.
[03:51:03.765 --> 03:51:05.286]  So it's very, very exciting.
[03:51:05.286 --> 03:51:08.687]  In the world's most murderous country, gun control is starting to lose its appeal.
[03:51:10.515 --> 03:51:17.460]  Desperate Brazilians are wondering whether they'd be better off armed, given that around 60,000 of their compatriots are killed each year.
[03:51:17.460 --> 03:51:20.382]  Polls show support for gun ownership gaining ground.
[03:51:20.382 --> 03:51:22.963]  In an election year, politicians are paying attention.
[03:51:22.963 --> 03:51:31.329]  One of the candidates leading the field of October's 2018 presidential election, hardline conservative, that means he's right of mousy tongue,
[03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:34.731]  He pronounced this right.
[03:51:34.731 --> 03:51:40.835]  Is that J-A-I-R, Jair Bolsonaro, how do you say that?
[03:51:40.835 --> 03:51:43.757]  I can't even speak English hardly.
[03:51:43.757 --> 03:51:44.598]  Okay.
[03:51:44.598 --> 03:51:57.667]  Has promised to allow law-abiding citizens to arm themselves, a popular pledge of the nation, with by far the most homicides, and then he goes into very strict gun control.
[03:51:57.667 --> 03:51:58.768]  So there you go.
[03:51:58.768 --> 03:51:59.869]  Boom.
[03:51:59.869 --> 03:52:02.411]  Let's continue on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:04.952 --> 03:52:11.114]  Californians fed up with housing costs and taxes are fleeing the state at record numbers.
[03:52:11.114 --> 03:52:12.554]  But see, it's like a space door.
[03:52:12.554 --> 03:52:13.614]  It's like a bulkhead.
[03:52:13.614 --> 03:52:14.574]  Use the same analogy.
[03:52:14.574 --> 03:52:18.375]  You open it, and the whole spaceship floods out into space.
[03:52:18.375 --> 03:52:21.316]  And that's out of CNBC.
[03:52:21.316 --> 03:52:27.417]  And it goes into the fact that when they come to Texas, God love them.
[03:52:27.417 --> 03:52:29.978]  You got a family, they walk up and say it's weird.
[03:52:29.978 --> 03:52:30.858]  If you're white.
[03:52:30.858 --> 03:52:31.939]  It'll be white people doing this probably.
[03:52:31.939 --> 03:52:33.299]  They're the weird mental patient minders.
[03:52:34.335 --> 03:52:40.636]  I think they're virtue signaling, you know, through the crowds of majority minorities who don't even listen to them in California.
[03:52:40.636 --> 03:52:43.317]  They're just there to try to live in America.
[03:52:43.317 --> 03:52:46.437]  And it's bad if you've got a truck.
[03:52:46.437 --> 03:52:47.957]  It's bad if you've got a big car.
[03:52:47.957 --> 03:52:49.558]  It's bad if you're conservative.
[03:52:49.558 --> 03:52:51.938]  If you've got a Trump hat on, they hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[03:52:51.938 --> 03:52:54.459]  I mean, they are fruitcakes.
[03:52:54.459 --> 03:52:58.719]  You know, if I was leaving something because I didn't like it, I wouldn't come recreate it.
[03:52:58.719 --> 03:53:02.300]  If I had a crazy girlfriend or something, you know, that, say, hurt herself.
[03:53:03.414 --> 03:53:09.460]  Uh, you know, I would not see her anymore and that I wouldn't get another girlfriend that hurt herself.
[03:53:09.460 --> 03:53:13.024]  And it just goes into the massive, massive record exodus.
[03:53:13.024 --> 03:53:15.546]  Millions and millions are pouring out.
[03:53:15.546 --> 03:53:21.833]  And so California's answer is to flood even more people in who don't have skills.
[03:53:21.833 --> 03:53:25.676]  And then it just goes into outbound migration.
[03:53:27.263 --> 03:53:28.884]  It gets into the housing problem.
[03:53:28.884 --> 03:53:33.847]  It gets into just the fact that expensive rents.
[03:53:33.847 --> 03:53:35.788]  Yeah, welcome to feudalism.
[03:53:35.788 --> 03:53:36.929]  Middle class leaving.
[03:53:36.929 --> 03:53:38.570]  That's the critical part.
[03:53:38.570 --> 03:53:44.213]  Internal Revenue Service data would appear to show that the middle class and middle-aged residents are the ones leaving.
[03:53:44.213 --> 03:53:48.316]  God, California is going to just totally implode.
[03:53:48.316 --> 03:53:53.019]  A Presidential Fellow in Urban Features at Chapman University in Orange, California.
[03:53:53.019 --> 03:53:56.261]  We know the actual net migration out of California has been growing.
[03:53:56.857 --> 03:53:58.118]  And it just goes on.
[03:53:58.118 --> 03:53:59.300]  Highest taxes in the USA.
[03:53:59.300 --> 03:54:03.705]  Well, I thought that was a good thing.
[03:54:03.705 --> 03:54:08.890]  Meanwhile, the Democrats have always been race-based since they ran the KKK, since they lost the first Civil War.
[03:54:12.071 --> 03:54:14.933]  And so I want to play a clip of demographics with Tucker Carlson.
[03:54:14.933 --> 03:54:29.805]  So they bet that they can get as many downtrodden third world populations in here, put a chip on their shoulder in high school and college, get them in the Democratic Party cult, keep them poor so they stay disadvantaged, disenfranchised as a permanent underclass, and then make it race-based
[03:54:31.223 --> 03:54:37.904]  To then have race-based blocks of voting, so people don't vote for Second Amendment, free market, things for themselves.
[03:54:37.904 --> 03:54:49.087]  They vote along skin color, thus robbing themselves of actually smartly voting in coalitions with white people, you name it, for free market, because we don't want to be Venezuela or Russia or China.
[03:54:49.087 --> 03:54:50.147]  See?
[03:54:50.147 --> 03:54:53.187]  So they just want you to sell your birthright on racism.
[03:54:53.187 --> 03:54:55.648]  And they think they're betting on minorities being racist.
[03:54:56.522 --> 03:55:01.393]  So far it's not delivered like they thought, but they just think get enough in it will.
[03:55:01.393 --> 03:55:04.721]  So let's play that clip from Tucker Carlson on The Demographics.
[03:55:05.632 --> 03:55:16.459]  A recent piece in National Geographic tells you a lot about demographics in America and about how bewilderingly fast they're changing without any real public debate on the subject.
[03:55:16.459 --> 03:55:20.082]  The magazine profiles a small coal mining town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania.
[03:55:20.082 --> 03:55:24.164]  In the year 2000, Hazleton's population was 2% Hispanic.
[03:55:24.164 --> 03:55:28.327]  Just 16 years later, Hazleton is majority Hispanic.
[03:55:28.327 --> 03:55:29.648]  That's a lot of change.
[03:55:29.648 --> 03:55:34.091]  People who grew up in Hazleton returned to find out they can't communicate with the people who now live there.
[03:55:34.091 --> 03:55:35.392]  And that's bewildering for people.
[03:55:35.872 --> 03:55:38.073]  That's happening all over the country.
[03:55:38.073 --> 03:55:43.036]  No nation, no society has ever changed this much, this fast.
[03:55:43.036 --> 03:55:48.999]  Now before you start calling anyone bigoted, consider and be honest, how would you feel if that happened in your neighborhood?
[03:55:48.999 --> 03:55:50.760]  It doesn't matter how nice the immigrants are.
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:52.100]  They probably are nice.
[03:55:52.100 --> 03:55:53.301]  Most immigrants are nice.
[03:55:53.301 --> 03:55:54.722]  That's not the point.
[03:55:54.722 --> 03:55:59.884]  The point is, this is more change than human beings are designed to digest.
[03:55:59.884 --> 03:56:04.987]  This pace of change makes societies volatile, really volatile, just as ours has become.
[03:56:05.347 --> 03:56:06.408]  Volatile.
[03:56:06.408 --> 03:56:08.670]  And notice where this change is not happening.
[03:56:08.670 --> 03:56:10.751]  Anyplace our leaders live.
[03:56:10.751 --> 03:56:16.455]  They caused all of this with their reckless immigration policies, and yet their own neighborhoods are basically unchanged.
[03:56:16.455 --> 03:56:18.757]  They look like it's 1960.
[03:56:18.757 --> 03:56:22.520]  No demographic change at all in their zip codes.
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:24.861]  Our leaders are for diversity, just not where they live.
[03:56:32.014 --> 03:56:33.274]  And I've been around a lot of this, man.
[03:56:33.274 --> 03:56:34.755]  They do not like brown people.
[03:56:34.755 --> 03:56:38.436]  I mean, I'm telling you, it's crazy if you know how evil they are.
[03:56:38.436 --> 03:56:39.996]  And see, that's the thing.
[03:56:39.996 --> 03:56:42.377]  If you're going to bring in Mexico, that's fine.
[03:56:42.377 --> 03:56:45.658]  Indoctrinate folks, free will, into the free market in America.
[03:56:45.658 --> 03:56:54.620]  Then don't bring the gangs with them and let them now feed on that subgroup that the left, the Democrats, sits above the Mexican mafia, and then they sit above the Mexican.
[03:56:54.620 --> 03:56:56.261]  And then it goes through that for each demographic.
[03:56:57.611 --> 03:56:58.352]  It's incredible.
[03:56:58.352 --> 03:56:59.652]  And that's the plan.
[03:56:59.652 --> 03:57:01.154]  It's a race-based system.
[03:57:01.154 --> 03:57:02.214]  I don't want that.
[03:57:02.214 --> 03:57:08.619]  I want it to be a political, economic system, cultural system based on ideas.
[03:57:08.619 --> 03:57:11.441]  And then it doesn't matter what color you are if we're all on the same team.
[03:57:11.441 --> 03:57:13.882]  Hey, free market really gives us a lot of opportunities.
[03:57:13.882 --> 03:57:14.663]  It builds a lot of great things.
[03:57:14.663 --> 03:57:16.184]  Speaking of that, I didn't plug this hour.
[03:57:16.184 --> 03:57:17.145]  Without you, we're not here.
[03:57:17.145 --> 03:57:19.807]  A bunch of big specials are about to end.
