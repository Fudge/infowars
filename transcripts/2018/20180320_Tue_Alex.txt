[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.023]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:16.065]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:39.284]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:42.125]  Tuesday, the 20th day of March 2018.
[00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:49.327]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we have an unusual overload of critical news and information.
[00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:50.648]  First off, out of the gates.
[00:00:52.268 --> 00:01:04.672]  One of the live feed names that we sent out over the internet today on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter has the headline in it, Learn Exclusively Why Facebook Stock Has Dropped Nearly $40 Billion.
[00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:09.034]  And it's not because of the one company
[00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:21.008]  Over in the UK that's involved in hundreds of elections a year with its analytics and scraping names to attach them to email lists for the different parties.
[00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:32.451]  It's because by the mainstream media finally reporting on what Facebook does, it then brings down the whole house of cards.
[00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:37.473]  So they were so desperate to try to act like Trump stole the election that they
[00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:50.789]  Gave away the farm by admitting that Facebook is a giant data mining operation and sells your information.
[00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.992]  And now the former head of Hillary's campaign has come out and said, oh yeah, we own Facebook of the Democratic Party.
[00:01:58.693 --> 00:01:59.633]  What did I say yesterday?
[00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.435]  I said Facebook is a Democratic Party globalist weapon system.
[00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:23.954]  And what the British company did, who by the way get hired by leftists, conservatives, you name it, and there is a lot of evidence of corruption going on there, that's what these companies do, that Bannon came and culled 5 million names off of billions on Facebook so they could email him.
[00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:30.075]  Now I said that Sunday when it broke, I said that yesterday, Snowden's come out and said that.
[00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:38.397]  Hillary's former manager has come out and said that because I'm not a tech guy, but I read the tech publications.
[00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.080]  And this is what these companies do.
[00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:51.666]  And this particular company over in the UK is small in the overall business.
[00:02:51.706 --> 00:03:00.272]  But the media thought, the control court media, that they could dynamite Trump and make it look like Trump had committed all these crimes.
[00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:06.615]  But then once people go, wait a minute, Facebook was involved.
[00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:11.299]  Oh, wait a minute, Facebook does it on a scale billions of times bigger because they're doing it every day.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:25.914]  How Trump consultants exploited the Facebook data of millions, millions, New York Times, Cambridge Analytica response after CEO filmed discussing bribery and entrapment of politicians around the world.
[00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:28.896]  They're just mercenaries.
[00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:35.102]  Authorities seek warrant to raid offices of Cambridge Analytica amid Facebook data showdown.
[00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:39.347]  This is what big data does.
[00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:40.628]  You think Facebook's bad?
[00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:44.912]  Alphabet and Google make Facebook look tame.
[00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:46.834]  Like a freshman.
[00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:49.257]  And Google has a master's degree.
[00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:58.682]  So, the left thought it could limit it, limit just showing you the Big Brother control grid, but only a small little snapshot.
[00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:04.185]  I mean, like, we're at a 30,000 foot view, and we're seeing all the different globalists and operations and thousands of companies.
[00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:08.387]  They zoomed in with a microscope down and went, look, this is the entire universe.
[00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:12.069]  The entire universe is nothing but Cambridge Analytica.
[00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:13.910]  They invented this.
[00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.170]  They are the reason.
[00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.993]  It's like saying the big bad Russians can steal all the elections when there's all these other people and players.
[00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:27.131]  It's like saying one high school team is the only football team in the world.
[00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:33.673]  No, you pull back and there's thousands of high school teams, there's hundreds of college teams, there's dozens of NFL teams.
[00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:36.174]  They just focus in, though, with deception.
[00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:40.897]  So you're looking right at the fine print and you pull back and it's like, whoa!
[00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:43.578]  And it's that pullback that's devastating Facebook.
[00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:56.344]  As everybody learns what we told you a decade ago, it's there to control dumb effers, run your life, scam you, manipulate you, sell your data, and social engineer you and make you depressed until you commit suicide.
[00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:00.390]  You think our information's hardcore?
[00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.991]  You think our focus is brutal?

[00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:35.947]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[00:05:36.447 --> 00:05:44.615]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:47.517]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:51.441]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:52.822]  We need your help.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.560]  Big Brother.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.281]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:11.842 --> 00:06:12.962]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:15.184]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:16.525]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:21.848]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:29.734]  Well, we've got another big, important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:37.908]  Facebook has seen its stock go down 40 billion dollars because the cat's out of the bag.
[00:06:38.408 --> 00:06:51.891]  The Democrats saw one little thread on the Christmas sweater and they reached out and grabbed it and began pulling back and pretty soon the whole sweater was in a big pile of yarn.
[00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:59.913]  Because Facebook, Amazon, Google, YouTube, Twitter, they're all giant
[00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.202]  Snooping systems.
[00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:16.651]  They're all giant psychological warfare systems to create false realities and then to control you and to use bots to manipulate your political, cultural, and economic views to consolidate power and wealth.
[00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.352]  They are looting operations.
[00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:29.740]  And the fact that the media, the controlled corporate media, the London Guardian, tried to act like Trump stole the election because one company, Cambridge Analytica,
[00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:35.204]  Was legally allowed by Facebook to go in and data mine.
[00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:45.712]  They thought they bought what 200 something thousand and they said they got into five million using that they leveraged it out to 50 million people they reach for the campaign.
[00:07:46.373 --> 00:07:50.676]  Well if you look at the reach in fact we go ask Lewis to give you a screenshot or or John.
[00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:56.904]  We, Facebook says we reach billions of people a quarter.
[00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.826]  Now that just means they get on a screen and see our information.
[00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.928]  Doesn't mean they read it, doesn't mean they watch the video, but it means...
[00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:09.941]  Billions of people just on our Facebook platforms see InfoWars material every quarter.
[00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:12.342]  I mean, last time I saw it was a couple billion a quarter.
[00:08:13.123 --> 00:08:18.026]  So when you hear numbers like 50 million reach, that is nothing.
[00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:20.387]  And I'm not defending Steve Bannon.
[00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:26.911]  I'm not even defending that back when he was at Breitbart, that he was trying to get a mailing list of people to come to Breitbart.
[00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:27.951]  That's what you should do.
[00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:29.532]  But I'm not even defending him.
[00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:30.393]  I don't like Steve Bannon.
[00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:32.134]  I'm defending reality.
[00:08:33.277 --> 00:08:53.216]  And so as soon as they began to look at how Facebook let this company in to do that, they're trying to say this one company with Facebook was the person that basically destroyed the virginity of the pure driven snow that is Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:08:54.318 --> 00:08:54.498]  No.
[00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.541]  Facebook is a giant gang raping operation.
[00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:02.629]  And thousands of companies should go in and buy whatever data they want.
[00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.011]  Law enforcement, private companies, private investors.
[00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:10.852]  There are hundreds of companies in Austin, Texas that mine Facebook.
[00:09:11.413 --> 00:09:12.393]  Where I sit.
[00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:14.854]  By the way, a new bombing today.
[00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:16.335]  Now a fifth bombing.
[00:09:16.495 --> 00:09:20.736]  Blew up at a FedEx facility in San Antonio, an hour south of where I sit.
[00:09:21.497 --> 00:09:23.977]  And it was another shrapnel bomb on its way to Austin.
[00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:24.918]  So the police said
[00:09:26.229 --> 00:09:31.851]  That it was a bomb that was being constructed right there on the site.
[00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:47.175]  I've confirmed from another law enforcement source that exactly what we were told, the individual at least with the first bombs was using a mousetrap so that when it flips it then powers the little capacitor and then detonates the bomb.
[00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:53.357]  That's what they call a tripwire in the woods or these other things is a pressure release bomb, a mousetrap.
[00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:58.361]  And then now I guess they've changed tactics again or it's more than one individual.
[00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:03.643]  Paul Watson makes the point that the Unabomber is being glorified on Netflix.
[00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.684]  The left unifies the Unabomber.
[00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:06.584]  I said that last week.
[00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:10.426]  I said that Theodore Kaczynski is like a poster child for the left.
[00:10:10.906 --> 00:10:12.167]  He's kind of worshipped by the left.
[00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:17.449]  And he's kind of a prototype of the Antifa in many respects.
[00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.010]  And so I said that could be it.
[00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.711]  Also the bombing looks like a circle.
[00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.700]  I was talking to some law enforcement sources this morning and they said that maybe they're just putting a circle around Austin.
[00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:36.421]  Or maybe it is kind of Fight Club-esque where they're gonna make a smiley face or that was fiction but somebody tried to recreate that a few years later blowing up mailboxes.
[00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:41.125]  Or perhaps it is a Zodiac Killer type deal where there's gonna be some codes in this.
[00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:50.132]  Because these loons tend to like to feel powerful, to feel important, and you know have a code then that everyone looks at.
[00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:52.314]  A lot of times it's kind of an occultic ritual.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.202]  They believe enough people look at it or see it that it becomes powerful.
[00:10:58.222 --> 00:10:59.362]  It gives them power.
[00:10:59.382 --> 00:11:04.785]  It's like the maniac that poisoned the treaty oak that was in central Austin.
[00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:10.007]  Big giant oak tree where they signed the treaty basically creating Texas.
[00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:19.432]  And he was a devil worshiper and at night he dug into it with a jackhammer and poured hundreds of pounds of weed killer.
[00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:21.019]  On the tree.
[00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:23.641]  So there's never any telling.
[00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:31.007]  I mean, the person's crazy or the group is out of their minds, but there's a lot of permutations in that.
[00:11:31.707 --> 00:11:34.630]  But you are getting the exclusive information that it is a pressure bombs.
[00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:42.817]  They're individuals using mousetraps that when you pick it up, it flips the mousetrap and that flips the switch that detonates the bomb.
[00:11:44.039 --> 00:12:04.129]  And from this law enforcement source, it's a separate one from the other two, more of a bomb expert, I'll just say that, that they don't understand, you know, they're saying it's primitive, they're saying it's dangerous, but it's not because they're attaching the wire after the mousetrap is set.
[00:12:04.669 --> 00:12:07.151]  It's still dangerous, but not like a mercury switch.
[00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:15.261]  It's a big, big, giant, crazy, dystopic soap opera, and we're all living right in the middle of it.
[00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:24.430]  So pray for folks, pray for everybody, and you never know, randomly, this is the type of lottery you don't want to win, where you go out to get that package.
[00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:27.372]  And it blows your arms off.
[00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:33.516]  I was talking to one source, and they talked about the poor 17-year-old man who was the second person to be bombed.
[00:12:34.516 --> 00:12:39.999]  And it blew his arms off, almost blew his head off, because it blew up right in a V-shaped doorway.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.841]  So he got the full force.
[00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:43.762]  But he felt no pain.
[00:12:44.842 --> 00:12:49.105]  Blew his arms off, blew a big hole in his chest, and almost blew his head off his shoulders.
[00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:51.874]  So that's what's going on there.
[00:12:51.894 --> 00:12:54.456]  Let's go out to the family and those folks.
[00:12:55.156 --> 00:13:00.620]  I got a bunch of other, it's so much news today, but let me get back to the whole Zuckerberg thing.
[00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:09.907]  This company, Cambridge Analytica, has hundreds of clients.
[00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:13.269]  And the new news is that now there's attention on them.
[00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:17.873]  There is Channel 4 report with undercover video of Alexander Nix.
[00:13:19.138 --> 00:13:38.586]  Well that sounds like a James Bond supervillain, Alexander Nix, telling undercover reporters posing as prospective Sri Lankan clients, because they'll be Republican, Democrat, they don't care, liberal, conservative, communist, whatever, that his company could potentially entrap politicians by setting them up with attractive women and filming the encounter and that they're mainly just former MI6 spies.
[00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:39.966]  Well, that's it!
[00:13:40.026 --> 00:13:49.973]  You graduate out of these, out of the military, and then out of college, or vice versa, and then into the CIA or other agencies, and then into the private operations.
[00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:53.795]  I keep explaining this to everybody, and they're just mercenary groups.
[00:13:54.556 --> 00:13:54.916]  That's all.
[00:13:56.017 --> 00:14:06.043]  And that's why 80% of the Russian bots were pro-Hillary, because it was just three different companies we now know of that just took money.
[00:14:07.463 --> 00:14:12.487]  And in elections, you get around the Federal Elections Commission if you're corrupt by going to foreign companies to do it.
[00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:16.009]  So, of course, there was Russian-based collusion.
[00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.391]  Very, very small, less than half percent.
[00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.573]  Even the congressional reports had met of overall bot activity.
[00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:24.075]  But it was some effective botting.
[00:14:24.435 --> 00:14:29.879]  Michael Moore out at anti-Trump rallies during the election, after the election, from the Russian bots.
[00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.720]  Because it was an effective company.
[00:14:32.421 --> 00:14:33.862]  And you pay them money, they'll go do it.
[00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.270]  I don't do that type of advertising.
[00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.031]  A lot of it's legal, but I still don't go there.
[00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:40.412]  You can go pay companies to bot your stuff everywhere.
[00:14:40.432 --> 00:14:46.654]  You can go pay companies to push your... You can go buy fake Twitter followers and Facebook likes and all that.
[00:14:46.674 --> 00:14:47.514]  Everybody knows about that.
[00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:50.675]  But they're trying to act like only Trump and only Bannon did this.
[00:14:51.395 --> 00:14:57.757]  And they're trying to conflate it with other stuff this company did with, you know, something that Trump supposedly did when Trump did nothing.
[00:14:58.377 --> 00:14:59.538]  And I'm not defending Trump.
[00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:00.618]  I'm defending reality.
[00:15:01.789 --> 00:15:10.275]  And that's why Facebook stocks down right at $40 billion today because they're going, wait, you're going to get this company in trouble for going and data mining millions of people out of here?
[00:15:10.995 --> 00:15:13.997]  When Facebook is a giant data mining operation and sells it to everybody?
[00:15:15.198 --> 00:15:16.559]  I can go to Facebook and buy data.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.263]  You can go to, let me tell you, money talks and you know what walks?
[00:15:21.323 --> 00:15:22.744]  You can't touch my three log box.
[00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:25.666]  So we're going to continue to watch that as it unfolds.
[00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:30.229]  But it just shows how the left is so savage, so mindless, so out of control.
[00:15:31.684 --> 00:15:32.525]  Trying to get Trump.
[00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:38.431]  There's a reason other bigger, smarter organizations didn't use this data to try to hurt Trump before.
[00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:47.781]  Because they know it leads right back to them, and now the head of the Clinton campaign admitting, we're going to cover that when we come back, they're saying, hey, we quote, own.
[00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:49.964]  We own.
[00:15:51.263 --> 00:15:51.684]  Facebook.
[00:15:52.224 --> 00:15:53.606]  The Democratic Party owns it.
[00:15:54.107 --> 00:15:56.509]  Yeah, and they're mad that Bannon tried to scratch the surface.
[00:15:57.631 --> 00:16:00.054]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[00:16:00.414 --> 00:16:02.297]  It's MycoZX Plus.
[00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:05.480]  Lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up.
[00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:08.124]  Signed a year contract with even bigger organic.
[00:16:08.604 --> 00:16:10.524]  Manufacturer and producer.
[00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:11.485]  Scalability.
[00:16:11.665 --> 00:16:16.506]  But now, we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off.
[00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:20.887]  Because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient in MycoZx.
[00:16:20.927 --> 00:16:22.367]  Now, it's the other side of the equation.
[00:16:22.547 --> 00:16:28.588]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment, pesticides, herbicides.
[00:16:28.648 --> 00:16:31.789]  But more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace
[00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:34.850]  Yeast mold creates slime walls.
[00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:41.453]  And once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues.
[00:16:41.473 --> 00:16:47.496]  Well, this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall.
[00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:50.218]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[00:16:50.738 --> 00:16:55.900]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus now from the Infowars store.
[00:17:02.182 --> 00:17:05.284]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:17:05.304 --> 00:17:05.844]  You're on the air.
[00:17:05.864 --> 00:17:07.005]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:07.105 --> 00:17:07.866]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:17:08.086 --> 00:17:08.706]  Hey, brother.
[00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:09.367]  Good, man.
[00:17:09.387 --> 00:17:10.187]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:10.267 --> 00:17:10.828]  Hey, hey.
[00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:15.331]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:21.935]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:17:22.055 --> 00:17:23.776]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:30.661]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:17:31.141 --> 00:17:32.261]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:17:32.321 --> 00:17:36.342]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.323]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:17:38.783 --> 00:17:39.523]  And exactly.
[00:17:39.543 --> 00:17:43.804]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:44.424]  Boom!
[00:17:44.544 --> 00:17:47.365]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:17:47.425 --> 00:17:47.965]  It's amazing.
[00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:52.246]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:17:57.634 --> 00:18:02.137]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:20.127]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:26.671]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:18:26.891 --> 00:18:37.016]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:18:37.256 --> 00:18:43.681]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:18:44.062 --> 00:18:46.684]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[00:18:46.944 --> 00:18:50.247]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:55.471]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.433]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:00.984 --> 00:19:02.385]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:19:02.445 --> 00:19:03.886]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:19:03.946 --> 00:19:04.307]  Go ahead.
[00:19:04.407 --> 00:19:04.687]  Yes.
[00:19:05.127 --> 00:19:05.848]  Hi, Alex.
[00:19:05.948 --> 00:19:12.153]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:16.357]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:18.038]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:19:18.398 --> 00:19:28.046]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:33.610]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:40.995]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:41.476]  So, thank you.
[00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:47.320]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coil-to-Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.764]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality coil-to-silver.
[00:19:52.864 --> 00:19:55.866]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:20:00.248 --> 00:20:06.450]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.832 --> 00:20:22.234]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:54.494]  So, think about how stupid the London Guardian is to put out a big story claiming that a guy with pink hair invented data mining.
[00:20:54.514 --> 00:20:56.555]  Well, that's what the NSA is.
[00:20:57.675 --> 00:21:00.896]  And that he invented going into Facebook and pulling names.
[00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:05.238]  Something that's been happening since the day Facebook began.
[00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:10.298]  And I'm going to get into a news article about that, documenting it in a moment.
[00:21:10.699 --> 00:21:15.368]  Obama's former campaign director makes bombshell claim Facebook was on our side.
[00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.376]  Goes on to say that we own them.
[00:21:20.692 --> 00:21:21.332]  On our side.
[00:21:21.512 --> 00:21:21.752]  Own them.
[00:21:22.012 --> 00:21:22.812]  That's the truth!
[00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:25.053]  Anybody been on Facebook knows that.
[00:21:25.073 --> 00:21:26.613]  They block your pro-America stuff.
[00:21:26.973 --> 00:21:28.534]  They force-feed you Hillary stuff.
[00:21:28.554 --> 00:21:29.534]  I mean, that's a fact.
[00:21:30.214 --> 00:21:34.695]  Facebook, YouTube, all of them put globalist propaganda in front of our videos and articles.
[00:21:35.135 --> 00:21:36.255]  They force-feed.
[00:21:36.555 --> 00:21:38.256]  They shadow-ban.
[00:21:38.516 --> 00:21:41.596]  And then they're claiming that Facebook is a weapon of Trump?
[00:21:42.496 --> 00:21:49.758]  Because one company in the UK got hired, Cambridge Analytica, by Breitbart to try to get more readers?
[00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:51.478]  That's what you do!
[00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:58.591]  Now, they're conflating it with other stuff the company does that's basically MI6 front group.
[00:22:00.947 --> 00:22:02.849]  Putting leftists in, putting globalists in.
[00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:05.852]  Again, most campaign spending worldwide is for leftists.
[00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:06.613]  Why?
[00:22:06.633 --> 00:22:14.721]  Because George Soros and USAID and the big foundations, they fund leftist garbage because it makes people dependent.
[00:22:15.282 --> 00:22:23.210]  Then the globalists sit offshore, they're all tax-exempt, Jeff Bezos, all of them, and they laugh at you when you're paying high taxes as a blue-collar worker.
[00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:27.003]  Sorry, I'm digressing into how they operate.
[00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:28.004]  So here it is.
[00:22:28.144 --> 00:22:32.585]  Obama's former campaign director makes bombshell claim Facebook was, quote, on our side.
[00:22:32.645 --> 00:22:39.846]  A series of Sunday night tweets, Davidson explained how Obama campaign was able to use Facebook to append our email list.
[00:22:39.866 --> 00:22:40.167]  Remember?
[00:22:40.347 --> 00:22:41.907]  What did I say Sunday when I was covering all this?
[00:22:42.267 --> 00:22:49.889]  I said, the basic thing the campaigns do is they just get a profile in a group for tailored email, tailored mailers.
[00:22:51.038 --> 00:22:52.079]  To your houses as well.
[00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:54.240]  And then they hit you with it.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:54.961]  That's what they're doing.
[00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:56.322]  They're getting a list.
[00:22:57.262 --> 00:23:02.486]  Getting a list for political or marketing purposes was not invented by Mr. Pink.
[00:23:02.766 --> 00:23:03.507]  Pink hair, okay?
[00:23:04.247 --> 00:23:05.388]  But they pick it as this thing.
[00:23:05.448 --> 00:23:06.789]  Oh, he's a whiz kid.
[00:23:06.809 --> 00:23:08.650]  Oh, oh, oh, he did it.
[00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.972]  Oh, look, it's a novelty.
[00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:14.014]  Look, Hawkins is in a wheelchair.
[00:23:14.054 --> 00:23:15.054]  Let's hear what he has to say.
[00:23:15.074 --> 00:23:16.135]  It's the same thing.
[00:23:16.816 --> 00:23:19.878]  So since I mentioned that we reach billions quarterly,
[00:23:21.132 --> 00:23:22.713]  According to Facebook's own analytics.
[00:23:23.013 --> 00:23:25.114]  Let me show you internal InfoWars analytics.
[00:23:25.194 --> 00:23:27.055]  I'm just going to say that and then I'll show you.
[00:23:27.295 --> 00:23:28.076]  Here's 2016 and our reach was 6,446,000,000.
[00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:29.997]  And then it goes on from there.
[00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:29.997]  721,000.
[00:23:30.157 --> 00:23:31.437]  And then 2017.
[00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:32.958]  I told you we grew everywhere.
[00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:33.118]  Oh, look. 9,476,944,000.
[00:23:49.653 --> 00:23:50.654]  So nine billion plus.
[00:23:50.834 --> 00:23:53.057]  Nine and a half billion over six and a half billion.
[00:23:54.979 --> 00:23:55.760]  Nine and a half billion.
[00:23:57.227 --> 00:23:58.248]  From six and a half billion.
[00:23:58.848 --> 00:23:59.169]  See that?
[00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:00.870]  Want to see some other stuff?
[00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.172]  You can really get lost in all this.
[00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:08.576]  Oh, by the way, this is just one of our Facebook surrenders.
[00:24:08.896 --> 00:24:10.257]  So, there you go.
[00:24:10.878 --> 00:24:14.120]  Oh my gosh, they got two hundred and something thousand people's names.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.701]  With that, they leveraged it to five million.
[00:24:16.062 --> 00:24:17.663]  And then they reached fifty million.
[00:24:18.083 --> 00:24:20.325]  Oh, the devastation of Bannon!
[00:24:20.485 --> 00:24:22.346]  Oh God, Bannon's so powerful!
[00:24:25.729 --> 00:24:27.170]  In fact, we even have a clip of people panicking.
[00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.970]  Can we play that clip?
[00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:35.935]  I saw him play it on the War Room last night where a guy pulls a pocketknife out in a city council meeting like it's no big deal.
[00:24:35.955 --> 00:24:36.835]  Hey, look at my pocketknife!
[00:24:36.855 --> 00:24:38.776]  And everyone just runs in fear.
[00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:40.697]  Oh God, Biden!
[00:24:40.717 --> 00:24:41.298]  50 million people!
[00:24:41.538 --> 00:24:42.018]  Ah, here it is!
[00:24:42.718 --> 00:24:45.700]  It would take the cops three to five minutes to come here.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.882]  Probably ten if the traffic's bad.
[00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:52.884]  What are you going to do now?
[00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:58.233]  Oh, it's a four-inch knife.
[00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:00.535]  Unsheathed.
[00:25:00.655 --> 00:25:01.776]  Unopened.
[00:25:01.816 --> 00:25:03.038]  Call 911, they're saying it.
[00:25:10.144 --> 00:25:12.446]  In fact, stop it.
[00:25:12.466 --> 00:25:13.887]  I don't want them to hear my junk noises.
[00:25:14.008 --> 00:25:15.149]  Actually listen to the sheep.
[00:25:16.294 --> 00:25:17.035]  He's a nice guy.
[00:25:17.055 --> 00:25:18.095]  His body language is nice.
[00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:20.317]  He's saying, you take the cops the time to get here.
[00:25:20.357 --> 00:25:21.018]  What if I did this?
[00:25:21.038 --> 00:25:21.979]  He pulls out a pocket knife.
[00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:22.979]  Just to illustrate it.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:23.820]  Totally legal.
[00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:25.501]  Cars are giant weapons.
[00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:26.442]  You could use chairs.
[00:25:26.802 --> 00:25:27.563]  They're in a library.
[00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:29.585]  They got paper cutters right there you could kill somebody with.
[00:25:30.806 --> 00:25:33.628]  But see, to them, it's the sign of a man with a weapon.
[00:25:35.249 --> 00:25:39.112]  And so there's something... It's like one time a lady was choking to death.
[00:25:39.813 --> 00:25:40.574]  I was in the bathroom.
[00:25:40.634 --> 00:25:41.074]  I come out.
[00:25:41.154 --> 00:25:42.795]  My ex-wife and my son's there.
[00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:44.817]  This takes me back like 15 years ago.
[00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:45.457]  I was like a year old.
[00:25:46.463 --> 00:25:51.924]  And this woman's turned in blue, and they're all saying, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, like a group of parrots.
[00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:55.705]  So I run over, get the big piece of food out of her.
[00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:56.166]  She lived.
[00:25:56.706 --> 00:25:59.526]  But they thought it was, like, miraculous that it was a Hamlet maneuver.
[00:26:00.507 --> 00:26:01.767]  And I was like, yeah, I was on the swim team.
[00:26:01.787 --> 00:26:02.927]  Yeah, I was trained by the fire department.
[00:26:02.967 --> 00:26:03.888]  You should know this too.
[00:26:04.468 --> 00:26:06.648]  So it's the same deal.
[00:26:06.848 --> 00:26:07.208]  Here it is.
[00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:10.069]  Five minutes to come here.
[00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:12.530]  Probably 10 if the traffic's bad.
[00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:16.750]  What are you going to do now?
[00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.031]  What are you going to do now?
[00:26:21.052 --> 00:26:21.252]  Stop it!
[00:26:21.292 --> 00:26:23.993]  What are you going to do when somebody's got a weapon and there's nobody to protect you?
[00:26:24.113 --> 00:26:25.934]  He's illustrating why they need weapons.
[00:26:26.634 --> 00:26:28.254]  Why they need designated people in the school.
[00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:34.797]  And then the kid runs off to get the police and you've got the air raid sirens now coming in.
[00:26:39.042 --> 00:26:40.543]  The Martians are invading!
[00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:41.403]  Run for the hills!
[00:26:41.703 --> 00:26:42.723]  We're in danger!
[00:26:43.564 --> 00:26:45.124]  Tell them you've got to do something!
[00:26:46.665 --> 00:26:46.985]  So.
[00:26:49.266 --> 00:26:53.308]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:56.349]  9 billion reached 2017.
[00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:59.550]  6 million reached 2016.
[00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.972]  Boy, you want to trigger CNN people, showing them this will certainly do it.
[00:27:06.453 --> 00:27:06.613]  So.
[00:27:08.717 --> 00:27:10.278]  That's what you need to know, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:12.820]  And it's all up on every front.
[00:27:13.481 --> 00:27:20.206]  By the way, we just got 20-plus affiliates the last couple of weeks, 12 of them this week.
[00:27:21.507 --> 00:27:22.508]  Those are radio affiliates.
[00:27:22.548 --> 00:27:25.610]  By the way, two of them are right in the middle of San Antonio.
[00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:26.591]  FM, baby.
[00:27:27.752 --> 00:27:29.053]  Oh yeah, it's just awesome.
[00:27:29.153 --> 00:27:31.295]  Houston's coming online, radio and TV.
[00:27:31.575 --> 00:27:36.099]  Not to mention we're already on Phonoscope 24 hours a day on the main cable channels.
[00:27:37.796 --> 00:27:40.417]  NobleRadio.com is one of the big networks picking us up.
[00:27:40.477 --> 00:27:41.857]  We are egg-cited.
[00:27:42.177 --> 00:27:46.738]  Your persecution has blown up in your big, fat, thug face, CNN.
[00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:51.499]  Same folks that, you know, a kid made a meme of Trump body-slamming CNN so they wanted to sue him.
[00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:54.919]  Same folks that openly call for us to be shut down and try to get our YouTube shut down.
[00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:57.260]  Same people that are trying to get all our sponsors taken.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.720]  Hey, morons!
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.501]  Those are YouTube sponsors.
[00:28:00.521 --> 00:28:02.221]  They already demonetized us, you idiots.
[00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:05.205]  But you want to create the illusion we're in trouble.
[00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:06.667]  The illusion we're going down.
[00:28:06.928 --> 00:28:08.630]  My lawyers have looked at all the lawsuits.
[00:28:10.071 --> 00:28:11.513]  They're total BS.
[00:28:12.034 --> 00:28:13.255]  But so you want to run my name to them?
[00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:16.720]  I just announced InfoWars is being sued for trademark infringement.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:17.821]  Not even true!
[00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:18.722]  Totally made up!
[00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:21.506]  Selling somebody else's poster who had authorization to print it.
[00:28:22.486 --> 00:28:23.547]  And we've got all those documents.
[00:28:23.787 --> 00:28:24.447]  I can't believe it.
[00:28:24.487 --> 00:28:26.928]  I mean, this goes beyond slapback, by the way.
[00:28:26.948 --> 00:28:29.089]  It's looking like it's going to be some serious fraud issues.
[00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:36.713]  Then we've got the other stuff with the University of Georgetown suing us, putting in the lawsuit defamatory stuff we didn't say.
[00:28:36.973 --> 00:28:38.914]  What happens when the judge sees that and there's not evidence of it?
[00:28:39.494 --> 00:28:49.143]  Dismissed, and now Virginia passed slapback in 2017, so I'm gonna sue the university, and I'm gonna sue the individual that falsely put these things in.
[00:28:49.583 --> 00:28:51.565]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:28:51.846 --> 00:28:54.228]  That's a two-way street, Jumbo Jack!
[00:28:57.105 --> 00:29:03.250]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in Fort Worth's life, it'd take hours.
[00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.572]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:06.593]  It's stronger.
[00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:08.775]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:29:08.795 --> 00:29:11.677]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:12.778]  It's back in stock.
[00:29:13.138 --> 00:29:14.760]  The Real Red Pill.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.961]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:19.664]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:29:20.085 --> 00:29:22.827]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:23.928]  So you can upload it.
[00:29:24.188 --> 00:29:33.217]  Our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:29:33.257 --> 00:29:34.118]  That's a spray you do.
[00:29:34.158 --> 00:29:35.098]  You can also swallow it.
[00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:37.361]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[00:29:38.181 --> 00:29:40.804]  Super high-quality silver and a lot more.
[00:29:40.824 --> 00:29:42.185]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:29:42.205 --> 00:29:51.815]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:29:52.135 --> 00:29:55.178]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:29:58.783 --> 00:30:03.488]  I'm not here pitching products because I just want to get a bigger house or a bigger car.
[00:30:03.949 --> 00:30:05.490]  I need to beat these people as everybody knows.
[00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.814]  They are all over the news saying we want to take Alex Jones off the air.
[00:30:10.535 --> 00:30:14.620]  From Sadiq Khan to the head of YouTube, we are to the CEO of News Corp.
[00:30:15.968 --> 00:30:19.631]  Okay, we want to first take him off the air, and then we're going to take everybody off.
[00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:20.772]  This is all admitted.
[00:30:20.812 --> 00:30:21.813]  I told you that a month ago.
[00:30:21.913 --> 00:30:23.154]  It's all happening, as you see.
[00:30:23.494 --> 00:30:26.256]  So, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, go there.
[00:30:26.276 --> 00:30:27.297]  Get the t-shirt of the month.
[00:30:27.377 --> 00:30:30.979]  Trump, Pence, 2020, with the new slogan, Keeping America Great.
[00:30:31.019 --> 00:30:32.100]  I haven't even done an ad for that.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.641]  I'm so busy.
[00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:34.562]  That's a one-month limited edition shirt.
[00:30:34.722 --> 00:30:36.263]  It's gone in just a few weeks.
[00:30:36.484 --> 00:30:37.885]  That's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:40.747]  In these lawsuits, Alex, I know the costs.
[00:30:41.267 --> 00:30:45.270]  My costs are up to a half a million dollars to fight the polio lawsuits.
[00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:54.958]  You're looking at millions of dollars, ultimately, to fight the lawsuits against you and against InfoWars because they're designed to silence you and shut you down.
[00:30:55.518 --> 00:31:04.826]  I tell my friends, look, even if you're not in the market for a t-shirt or you don't want the super blue fluoride free line of products right now, there's a donate button.
[00:31:05.386 --> 00:31:21.956]  If you just want to help the fight for freedom, if you like what we're doing here, and you're not, just don't happen to be in the market for products because you've already got them or you're on auto ship, you can just go to the donate button and send us $25, $100, $150, $200.
[00:31:22.876 --> 00:31:31.121]  We're looking at massive, massive legal costs to fight the globalists and fight the effort to just shut us down.
[00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:32.202]  So if you love InfoWars,
[00:31:32.702 --> 00:31:34.843]  Hit that donate button.
[00:31:34.883 --> 00:31:35.303]  Exactly.
[00:31:35.343 --> 00:31:38.765]  We don't have the Annenberg and CPP and Rockefeller Foundation funding us.
[00:31:38.785 --> 00:31:39.965]  We have the Lister's doing it.
[00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:45.867]  And we're taking Soros and the globalists and Obama suing you, saying you're a Russian agent.
[00:31:45.927 --> 00:31:48.108]  And they're suing us with all this frivolous stuff.
[00:31:48.148 --> 00:31:50.089]  We're winning is why they're targeting us.
[00:31:50.369 --> 00:31:53.471]  But people need to know this is the war for this republic.
[00:31:53.491 --> 00:31:54.111]  This is it.
[00:31:56.522 --> 00:31:57.903]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:31:58.163 --> 00:31:59.464]  You can't survive without it.
[00:31:59.664 --> 00:32:00.564]  But where do you get it?
[00:32:00.864 --> 00:32:06.628]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:32:06.848 --> 00:32:12.571]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:32:12.751 --> 00:32:29.618]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:32:30.018 --> 00:32:32.139]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:32:32.499 --> 00:32:33.700]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.741]  Easy assembly.
[00:32:35.001 --> 00:32:35.641]  Low maintenance.
[00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:37.742]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:05.912]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.894 --> 00:33:13.998]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.566 --> 00:33:28.828]  We are living in an extremely historic time.
[00:33:28.848 --> 00:33:30.029]  I think everybody knows that.
[00:33:31.129 --> 00:33:40.776]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones, with my intrepid team of researchers that you can see if you're watching on television, backing me up in there and the rest of the crew and you out there across this country and across the world.
[00:33:40.796 --> 00:33:45.359]  Let me just recap some of the top stories and tell you the guests that are coming up because it's jam-packed today.
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:58.928]  We've got another bomb that's gone off, but this time didn't kill anybody, thank God, in San Antonio at a FedEx processing center in San Antonio with delivery to an unnamed address in Austin.
[00:33:59.923 --> 00:34:08.005]  The night before that, you had a bomb go off with a tripwire in a neighborhood on the edge of a greenbelt, injuring two men about a mile and a half from where I live.
[00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:13.706]  And then you had three other bombings that killed two other people before that.
[00:34:13.726 --> 00:34:21.548]  And I've now talked to local, state, and federal law enforcement, including one individual that was directly hands-on.
[00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.349]  And they're saying, they don't know why it hasn't been released yet.
[00:34:26.437 --> 00:34:34.683]  A lot of it was technical, it was over the phone this morning, and I should have written it all down, but it's mousetraps under the package.
[00:34:35.483 --> 00:34:44.649]  And then when you move that, it's got a wire that the mousetrap throws, and I guess it sends a charge through a capacitor, and then that goes in and then detonates the bomb.
[00:34:44.689 --> 00:34:55.857]  So it's more sophisticated than what some of the other people were saying, according to this source, because yes, it's a pressure bomb, yes, it's dangerous when you place it, but because you don't hook the wire
[00:34:57.366 --> 00:35:04.671]  To the wire that goes to the detonator, until you've already set the mousetrap, it's not as dangerous as some have thought, and it's more sophisticated.
[00:35:05.629 --> 00:35:11.691]  So you're kind of getting the perspectives from, you know, FBI, but FBI that's not the bomb folks, just there at the scene.
[00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:15.972]  Or from police that are there, but not bomb squad or bomb squad.
[00:35:16.452 --> 00:35:19.673]  So we're getting perspectives here, and you're getting exclusives here.
[00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:23.494]  No one else has this, and we first told you it was a pressure release bomb.
[00:35:23.734 --> 00:35:25.154]  That came out on Fox News two days later.
[00:35:25.174 --> 00:35:31.696]  I mean, this is directly from every level of the investigation, federal, state, and local, on the ground.
[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.213]  And it's getting more serious, obviously two dead, four or five what injured.
[00:35:38.494 --> 00:35:44.698]  You've got just the hysteria it creates, because everybody's getting packages, pretty much everybody.
[00:35:45.399 --> 00:35:59.088]  I'd say 98% of people get packages, get mail, and you don't know when it's gonna blow up, or when you pick the package up, it triggers and blows your arms off, blows your face off.
[00:36:00.154 --> 00:36:18.009]  So it's a real tragedy, and it's just totally senseless, and a lot of people, because of past activity, believe that this may be a Unabomber-type situation.
[00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:20.531]  And that article's up on Infowars.com.
[00:36:22.152 --> 00:36:26.856]  Paul Joseph Watson article, it's linked on DrugsReport.com as well.
[00:36:28.294 --> 00:36:30.537]  So we're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:33.841]  Getting back into Facebook.
[00:36:35.644 --> 00:36:39.028]  Again, they've lost almost $40 billion over privacy scandal.
[00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.232]  Reuters is reporting because
[00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:45.105]  It's what the company does.
[00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:57.833]  And so if they try to make Trump and Bannon look bad for some little company trying to bottom feed off Facebook, then that opens up Pandora's box and Facebook is the leftist engine.
[00:36:59.474 --> 00:37:05.498]  And you got the former head of the Clinton campaign saying that Facebook's on their side and the Democrats own it and all this.
[00:37:05.758 --> 00:37:07.319]  Well, of course they do!
[00:37:08.299 --> 00:37:11.001]  So it blew up spectacularly.
[00:37:11.501 --> 00:37:12.402]  No pun intended.
[00:37:15.523 --> 00:37:29.539]  Because the media just covered up Facebook, surveilling everybody and selling data and trying to keep you depressed and manipulating you and trying to keep you in a little control room of virtual reality with bots you think are real people manipulating you.
[00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:35.986]  So when you read the Cambridge Analytica article, it's like, Bannon used this to bully users into supporting Trump.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.761]  And actually they were using it for a database.
[00:37:38.781 --> 00:37:41.703]  They weren't as sophisticated as Facebook that actually does use it to bully people.
[00:37:41.943 --> 00:37:45.026]  And you've had Sean Parker go public and others for two years.
[00:37:45.266 --> 00:37:45.906]  That's what's going on.
[00:37:46.146 --> 00:37:51.950]  So they basically in this article wrote what Facebook does, but then blamed it on Cambridge Analytica.
[00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:56.594]  But that's now the breadcrumbs right in to Facebook.
[00:37:57.874 --> 00:38:01.557]  So yeah, they kind of self-immolated Bannon and Cambridge Analytica.
[00:38:01.937 --> 00:38:02.698]  They did it themselves.
[00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:04.259]  They poured gasoline all over them and then
[00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:16.308]  The idiots, the left, went back to Facebook headquarters with the can of gas around their back but it still had a few gallons in it and it was just leaked with a trail right back in to Facebook headquarters.
[00:38:17.688 --> 00:38:34.751]  So they just torched Cambridge Analytica and the fire line went right back in to Facebook and I'm sitting back at a distance here watching Facebook have a huge mushroom cloud explosion and a whole side of it blow out and about a third of the company just caved in.
[00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:38.200]  I'm like, hey, let's get some hot dogs here.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.161]  You know?
[00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.502]  Facebook doesn't change their ways.
[00:38:41.982 --> 00:38:43.303]  We send everybody to Facebook.
[00:38:43.383 --> 00:38:44.744]  We put our material on Facebook.
[00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:46.645]  You put your material on Facebook.
[00:38:47.565 --> 00:38:56.450]  And then they start ratcheting it down and squeezing it and not letting you talk to your real friends and not letting you have real access to information and then make you pay more and more and more just to talk to your friends.
[00:38:56.971 --> 00:38:57.991]  That's what Facebook is now.
[00:38:58.672 --> 00:38:59.152]  And you know what?
[00:38:59.192 --> 00:39:00.032]  It's a private company.
[00:39:00.093 --> 00:39:01.733]  If you opt into that, that's your issue.
[00:39:02.864 --> 00:39:10.387]  When they start restricting us for our political speech, and discriminating, if you don't want to bake a cake for anybody, and you want to close your doors, you can do that.
[00:39:11.527 --> 00:39:21.571]  But if you say you're not going to bake a cake for Christians, or conservatives, or gays, or anybody, when you're a big institution under federal law, and I agree with it, you're discriminating, and that's wrong!
[00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:28.033]  I don't want to walk into some gas station, and I got a cross on my shirt, and somebody says, you get out of here because you're a Christian.
[00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:33.792]  As long as it's not obscene, and a gay couple wants to stick two dudes on top of the cake.
[00:39:33.812 --> 00:39:34.612]  Here, get your cake!
[00:39:36.473 --> 00:39:37.873]  Now, is that $500,000?
[00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:38.553]  I don't think so.
[00:39:38.613 --> 00:39:38.853]  But!
[00:39:40.014 --> 00:39:45.215]  You lie about me in the media, and you lie about what I say, and then you won't let me respond on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:39:45.395 --> 00:39:47.295]  Twitter's worse, by the way, than Facebook and censorship.
[00:39:47.976 --> 00:39:48.636]  Then what is that?
[00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:57.058]  Because you're not just not letting me have access to the marketplace, you're discriminating against me while you let other people bully me, and then you turn around and say you're a bully.
[00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:04.001]  David Hogg went on TV and said he's being bullied by the NRA and others.
[00:40:05.522 --> 00:40:06.523]  They're scared to debate him.
[00:40:07.143 --> 00:40:08.964]  And that they can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[00:40:11.065 --> 00:40:12.365]  I guess the other young person said that.
[00:40:12.405 --> 00:40:13.346]  They're both on the show.
[00:40:14.406 --> 00:40:15.747]  Clips on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:15.767 --> 00:40:18.148]  Well, why not just play the clip?
[00:40:18.168 --> 00:40:18.869]  We'll get it cued up.
[00:40:19.689 --> 00:40:21.070]  But again, that's illustrative.
[00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.832]  That's illustrative of how he challenged me to a debate.
[00:40:26.963 --> 00:40:33.726]  And then he chickened out and the media turned it around and said I was contacting him, bullying him, and he refused to come on.
[00:40:33.746 --> 00:40:38.527]  And then the guy that started a fight with my son in the airport, he said the same thing.
[00:40:38.547 --> 00:40:40.788]  Stop bullying Hogg and trying to get him on your show.
[00:40:40.828 --> 00:40:43.629]  And I said, man, Hogg has to come on my show.
[00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.950]  He's like, oh, no, he didn't.
[00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.111]  These people are in fruitcake land, man.
[00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:51.952]  Because everything with them, there's no morals.
[00:40:52.012 --> 00:40:53.453]  It's like, OK.
[00:40:55.507 --> 00:40:55.887]  Okay.
[00:40:56.808 --> 00:40:57.529]  I want to debate you.
[00:40:57.649 --> 00:40:57.909]  Okay?
[00:40:57.929 --> 00:40:59.030]  I respectfully would like you on.
[00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:00.792]  No, I'm not going to debate you.
[00:41:00.832 --> 00:41:01.692]  You're a horrible person.
[00:41:02.013 --> 00:41:03.034]  And you're a piece of this and that.
[00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:03.994]  Okay.
[00:41:05.315 --> 00:41:05.936]  Someone in the airport.
[00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:06.717]  How dare you!
[00:41:06.737 --> 00:41:08.198]  Tell him to come on your show, you bully!
[00:41:08.518 --> 00:41:09.579]  Actually, he has to come on.
[00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:10.060]  Ah, whatever.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.462]  See, they don't care about reality.
[00:41:12.802 --> 00:41:14.223]  Speaking of that, here's David Hogg.
[00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:15.164]  And what's the girl's name?
[00:41:15.985 --> 00:41:18.527]  With a sh- Abra Gonzales?
[00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:20.048]  Emma Gonzales.
[00:41:20.108 --> 00:41:20.609]  Okay, here it is.
[00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:25.802]  The people at the top of the NRA are no longer working for the people that are in their organization.
[00:41:25.822 --> 00:41:27.203]  They're working on behalf of the gun lobby.
[00:41:27.723 --> 00:41:28.304]  The gun lobby.
[00:41:28.884 --> 00:41:34.529]  And when you talk about the NRA and you make a suggestion like that, what do they say to you?
[00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:36.350]  What does the NRA say to you?
[00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.431]  Have they been reaching out to you?
[00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:43.336]  I know that, you know, we had a representative show up at the town hall meeting that you guys participated in, but has the organization been reaching out to you guys?
[00:41:43.356 --> 00:41:45.878]  The way that they've been reaching out to us is basically threatening us.
[00:41:46.278 --> 00:41:50.722]  They've been instigating things, and then when we reply, they shy back away.
[00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:54.505]  They can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.505]  Let's talk about the facts.
[00:41:55.545 --> 00:41:56.806]  You can go to both their Twitter feeds.
[00:41:57.287 --> 00:42:06.234]  Both these guys attack this group, attack that organization, call people pieces of S-word, call them mass murderers, call them killers, burn her.
[00:42:07.735 --> 00:42:10.077]  That's the stuff that goes on with the four kids they've chosen.
[00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.473]  She's particularly, you know, called people killers and stuff to their faces.
[00:42:16.413 --> 00:42:24.880]  And then, when they're calling me a piece of you-know-what, when they're calling me a snakehole salesman, when they're calling me a liar, I'm like, I'd respectfully like you to come on and clear the air, and I'd like to work things out.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.221]  And I do believe people were shot there, and I'm glad you survived.
[00:42:27.842 --> 00:42:29.263]  Shut up, you piece of S.H.
[00:42:29.463 --> 00:42:29.803]  whatever.
[00:42:30.404 --> 00:42:36.548]  That then turns into, that then turns into Alex Jones and the NRA, they bullied me.
[00:42:37.689 --> 00:42:40.510]  They bullied our little boo-boos.
[00:42:41.371 --> 00:42:42.631]  By the way, it's not the lobby.
[00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:44.252]  It's called the Second Amendment, the right.
[00:42:44.632 --> 00:42:49.234]  And because it happens to also be associated with property, then we can have a lobby, which is key.
[00:42:49.594 --> 00:42:52.375]  Rights and property together equal freedom.
[00:42:57.237 --> 00:43:02.139]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:11.496]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[00:43:13.977 --> 00:43:20.098]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[00:43:21.499 --> 00:43:24.039]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:28.240]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.301]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[00:43:33.052 --> 00:43:38.254]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[00:43:40.174 --> 00:43:46.796]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[00:43:47.757 --> 00:43:48.757]  It's up to us personally.
[00:43:50.157 --> 00:43:57.000]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.800]  I expected that to happen.
[00:43:59.981 --> 00:44:01.321]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:44:03.311 --> 00:44:14.237]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[00:44:14.938 --> 00:44:16.479]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:28.806]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[00:44:29.386 --> 00:44:31.568]  And we've already come so far together
[00:44:32.591 --> 00:44:41.617]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[00:44:42.177 --> 00:44:47.601]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[00:44:48.742 --> 00:44:56.607]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.583]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[00:45:05.104 --> 00:45:07.106]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[00:45:07.626 --> 00:45:09.087]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[00:45:10.088 --> 00:45:12.729]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.351]  We have more than that tuned in over the years.
[00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:20.294]  The point is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[00:45:21.395 --> 00:45:32.139]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:36.161]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[00:45:37.586 --> 00:45:38.246]  Our game changing.
[00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:40.167]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:42.949]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[00:45:43.329 --> 00:45:44.489]  The other equation of probiotic.
[00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:48.111]  It's now stronger and a lower price in PullmoreStore.com.
[00:45:48.411 --> 00:45:53.934]  We've got the real red pill that's got preglanone that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[00:45:54.514 --> 00:45:58.857]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids, it just does incredible things.
[00:45:59.297 --> 00:46:00.759]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:03.741]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:11.646]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine and other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[00:46:12.287 --> 00:46:14.949]  We now have not just the mouthwash but Super Blue
[00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:23.392]  Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:30.755]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[00:46:30.775 --> 00:46:35.216]  It's a disinfectant for the hands, it's great for the throat and the body, you can swallow it as well.
[00:46:35.597 --> 00:46:41.579]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:43.560]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:53.204]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com, and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:46:53.525 --> 00:46:56.606]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:47:00.688 --> 00:47:03.349]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.481]  You found it.
[00:47:20.002 --> 00:47:22.705]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:23.085 --> 00:47:24.908]  It's the Infowar.
[00:47:25.148 --> 00:47:29.794]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.675 --> 00:47:33.398]  Ladies and gentlemen, this just broke.
[00:47:34.424 --> 00:47:43.832]  One minute ago, put out by the state-sponsored RT, Trump to meet Putin to discuss arms race that is getting out of control.
[00:47:44.032 --> 00:47:51.458]  The president just told the Russian government, President Trump, that he is going to be meeting with Putin.
[00:47:52.285 --> 00:47:52.485]  U.S.
[00:47:52.525 --> 00:48:02.389]  President Donald Trump said he will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the not-too-distant future to discuss an arms race that Trump called out of control.
[00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.692]  He also congratulated Putin on his election.
[00:48:08.572 --> 00:48:10.873]  Victory details to follow.
[00:48:11.413 --> 00:48:12.954]  But this just broke.
[00:48:13.554 --> 00:48:17.356]  Trump-Putin want to talk about arms race North Korea.
[00:48:18.216 --> 00:48:19.057]  Again, the full story
[00:48:20.345 --> 00:48:23.227]  is on Infowars.com.
[00:48:23.687 --> 00:48:41.759]  Also, he's set to meet in the next month or so with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, forced to come to the table under crippling sanctions that actually affected the communist dictatorship, not just the people, what Trump called the strategy of maximum pressure.
[00:48:43.399 --> 00:48:55.071]  So, major developments unfolding as Trump's winning streak is now, quite frankly, starting to scare me, because something going this good, it's just amazing.
[00:48:55.131 --> 00:49:04.621]  I mean, the economy, the borders, the security, the sovereignty, the jobs coming back, the tax cuts crippling and phasing out.
[00:49:05.302 --> 00:49:06.023]  Obamacare.
[00:49:06.083 --> 00:49:15.731]  This is an amazing time to be alive and the globalists are trying to get Trump to be anti-Russian when there's not evidence of Russia involved in anything like Communist China is.
[00:49:15.871 --> 00:49:18.133]  It's Communist China that's infiltrated our government.
[00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:19.674]  That's all confirmed.
[00:49:19.954 --> 00:49:21.556]  So this just broke minutes ago.
[00:49:21.936 --> 00:49:24.438]  President Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to meet.
[00:49:24.818 --> 00:49:28.422]  The two leaders should set up a possible meeting to discuss the nuclear arms race.
[00:49:29.202 --> 00:49:44.372]  Global terrorism and how to solve tensions in North Korea according to a report the two leaders spoke out in favor of developing Practical operation in various areas and they just spoke today including in ensuring strategic stability and combating international terrorism
[00:49:44.992 --> 00:49:47.113]  And again, the Russian government put out their report.
[00:49:47.293 --> 00:49:48.013]  It's the New York Post.
[00:49:48.113 --> 00:49:48.894]  It's buddies with Trump.
[00:49:48.934 --> 00:49:50.234]  Just put this out simultaneously.
[00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:58.398]  In particular, they stress the importance of concerted efforts to curb the arms race, toss the Russian state news agency reported, citing a statement from the Kremlin.
[00:49:58.798 --> 00:50:00.119]  The sides agree to develop further.
[00:50:01.019 --> 00:50:04.960]  Bilateral contacts, including in the context of reshuffles in the U.S.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.861]  State Department, special attention was focused on the issue of possible top-level meeting.
[00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:18.744]  The report said the White House said Trump called Putin after the Russian leader widely expected election win on Sunday, giving him another six years.
[00:50:18.764 --> 00:50:21.245]  He won by 70 plus percent, 76 percent.
[00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:24.306]  In a victory speech, 65-year-old Putin said nobody plans
[00:50:24.966 --> 00:50:25.366]  We're good to go.
[00:50:37.779 --> 00:50:38.239]  There you go.
[00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:43.883]  Those reports are all being posted to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com as we speak.
[00:50:43.903 --> 00:50:47.706]  We'll continue to watch the ongoing terrible bombings happening in Central Texas.
[00:50:47.746 --> 00:50:54.230]  The fifth such bombing this morning, south of Austin in San Antonio, in a package being delivered to Austin.
[00:50:55.031 --> 00:50:59.133]  We also have details exclusively from the bomb squad and others.
[00:50:59.634 --> 00:51:01.615]  There's mousetrap pressure switches.
[00:51:02.395 --> 00:51:07.479]  When the mousetrap gets triggered under the box, it then sends an electrical charge detonating the bomb.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.603]  So we're going to give you more exclusives on that.
[00:51:10.684 --> 00:51:17.574]  Facebook's down by 40 billion as it was learned that they have been involved in massive spying and political operations for the Democrats.
[00:51:17.915 --> 00:51:22.502]  The Democrats triggered this all coming out by going after Republicans trying to bottom feed.
[00:51:23.303 --> 00:51:31.465]  And skim off the Democrat operation, but that is now spectacularly blown up in their little faces, because they don't think two or three or four steps ahead.
[00:51:31.765 --> 00:51:42.847]  And the former head of the Clinton campaign has gone public saying, quote, you know, they work with Facebook, they own Facebook, they control Facebook, and quote, Facebook is on our side.
[00:51:42.867 --> 00:51:47.608]  That's a Zero Hedge article, also up on InfoWars.com.
[00:51:48.369 --> 00:51:50.349]  Now, stopping right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:51.758 --> 00:51:53.119]  We are getting more affiliates.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.361]  And we are getting a lot of new TV stations picking us up.
[00:51:56.802 --> 00:52:04.947]  But there have been massive costs involved with putting us on more satellites, putting in the crew to reach out to the stations, and to service the stations, and the things that go with that.
[00:52:05.027 --> 00:52:19.157]  So we are not behind the eight ball financially, but with the 12 suits that lawyers for Hillary Clinton and others in Georgetown University and State Department officials have filed against us, all the suits can be beaten in court.
[00:52:20.515 --> 00:52:33.098]  In fact, they can be beaten very easily, but it still takes preparing and going in for the summary judgments, then we have to hit them with slap statutes to get the attorney's fees back, and then counter-sue so they stop doing it, or they'll just keep doing it until we're destroyed.
[00:52:33.738 --> 00:52:38.279]  So it is your prayers, it is your support that is absolutely critical, and the reason we're here.
[00:52:38.339 --> 00:52:40.299]  But I want to thank all the new affiliates picking us up.
[00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.620]  I want to thank all the old affiliates that have stood by us.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.640]  You've seen this broadcast bear fruit.
[00:52:45.851 --> 00:52:46.912]  You've seen InfoWars grow.
[00:52:46.972 --> 00:52:48.553]  You've seen a patriot president.
[00:52:49.214 --> 00:52:52.716]  You've seen things that are just hard to believe five years ago now happening.
[00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:55.398]  And that's because good exists, not just evil.
[00:52:55.458 --> 00:52:58.260]  So for myself and the crew, thank you for your support.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.623]  And please, when you're shopping and you need supplements,
[00:53:04.008 --> 00:53:05.209]  Or you need water filtration.
[00:53:05.989 --> 00:53:07.189]  Or air filtration.
[00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:10.251]  Or you need books and videos.
[00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:11.991]  Or you need emergency radios.
[00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:13.332]  Or great survival gear.
[00:53:13.472 --> 00:53:18.694]  Or the ultimate AR-15 type system from Spikes Tactical.
[00:53:18.954 --> 00:53:19.914]  Use promo code ALEX.
[00:53:20.855 --> 00:53:21.735]  Get 5% off.
[00:53:22.395 --> 00:53:25.037]  When you shop with the good guys, you're funding the future.
[00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:25.837]  You're not just getting
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.541]  Great products.
[00:53:27.982 --> 00:53:29.003]  So, think about us.
[00:53:29.985 --> 00:53:30.966]  Think about InfoWars.
[00:53:31.366 --> 00:53:33.530]  Get 10% off additionally when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.814]  That way, every month, every two months, every three months, every half year.
[00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:39.209]  You just one click, you set it.
[00:53:39.909 --> 00:53:40.890]  Just like an Amazon account.
[00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:41.410]  It's high-tech.
[00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:42.311]  It's all secure.
[00:53:42.631 --> 00:53:44.632]  You can click, cancel, anytime.
[00:53:45.132 --> 00:53:47.474]  But then you'll get the colloidal silver you want every month.
[00:53:47.494 --> 00:53:48.894]  You'll get the Mico ZX.
[00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:54.038]  You'll get the Wake Up America coffee that people love so much, they don't even plug anymore.
[00:53:54.058 --> 00:53:55.659]  It's becoming really one of our best sellers.
[00:53:55.679 --> 00:53:56.239]  It didn't used to be.
[00:53:56.599 --> 00:54:02.102]  I was thinking about stopping doing the coffee a couple years ago, and now Tim's like, wow, this is like just selling off the shelves.
[00:54:02.463 --> 00:54:05.184]  But it is because we also, it's quality and we sell it for a very affordable price.
[00:54:05.685 --> 00:54:06.925]  That's one reason I looked at getting rid of it.
[00:54:08.046 --> 00:54:08.286]  Hang on.
[00:54:08.306 --> 00:54:13.071]  That's not a lot of money, folks, compared to other people selling coffee at this quality.
[00:54:13.732 --> 00:54:17.656]  The very same stuff sells in Whole Foods for $30 a bag.
[00:54:17.696 --> 00:54:19.318]  It's the exact same stuff from Chiapas.
[00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:20.079]  It's excellent.
[00:54:20.099 --> 00:54:21.240]  It's like Guatemalan, but better.
[00:54:21.621 --> 00:54:22.722]  Anyways, I'm going to stop ranting.
[00:54:23.202 --> 00:54:25.185]  It's Paul Joseph Watson mug.
[00:54:25.245 --> 00:54:26.025]  It's all in there.
[00:54:26.166 --> 00:54:27.447]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:27.787 --> 00:54:28.608]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:54:31.753 --> 00:54:33.556]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:54:33.976 --> 00:54:37.381]  And pollen block for seasonal discomfort, all the pollen and garbage.
[00:54:37.821 --> 00:54:45.391]  When I forget to take it during this hay fever season, it's spring down here, my eyes are watering, my nose is watering, and Daria's like, take your pollen block.
[00:54:46.172 --> 00:54:48.474]  Hour later, 90% reduced.
[00:54:48.534 --> 00:54:53.877]  It's like I'm not a pill popper myself, but this isn't like Tylenol or something that eats your liver.
[00:54:54.518 --> 00:54:57.940]  All this stuff is natural from Mother Nature and it works really, really great.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.203]  That's why there's tens of thousands of reviews on the site for the products.
[00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:04.096]  MycoZX has been sold out for months.
[00:55:04.116 --> 00:55:05.837]  It's the other side of the equation for probiotics.
[00:55:05.857 --> 00:55:07.578]  We've got probiotics that are excellent as well.
[00:55:08.439 --> 00:55:13.942]  But it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, the fungus, the slime walls, where it takes over your guts.
[00:55:14.562 --> 00:55:16.183]  And MycoZX is amazing.
[00:55:16.223 --> 00:55:17.384]  We signed a year contract.
[00:55:18.184 --> 00:55:27.227]  Got even more concentrated, stronger per capsule, more in each bottle, and I got it for 30% less than I was getting it before, so I passed the savings on.
[00:55:27.567 --> 00:55:28.287]  Normal retail was $80.
[00:55:28.907 --> 00:55:29.667]  Used to sell for about $60.
[00:55:30.868 --> 00:55:32.208]  Now I can get it for less.
[00:55:32.548 --> 00:55:34.009]  Well, now normal retail is $60.
[00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:34.849]  Right now it's $27.
[00:55:34.949 --> 00:55:36.009]  We normally mark it up 100%.
[00:55:39.312 --> 00:55:45.178]  When we cut it down that much, ladies and gentlemen, it is either a break-even or we might make three or four dollars.
[00:55:45.198 --> 00:55:49.001]  But I want you to see how great it is so you keep reordering it at the regular price.
[00:55:49.042 --> 00:55:49.802]  It's already a great deal.
[00:55:50.083 --> 00:56:01.354]  We also now have a new part of the silver family on our website, the Super Blue System of the fluoride-free toothpaste, 4-5-Acolytl Silver 9-9, and the great Lung Cleanse product as well that's amazing.
[00:56:02.034 --> 00:56:08.905]  So thick though with essential oil, there's no filler that you got to clean out the top sometimes if you haven't used it in a while because it is amazing the amount of product in this.
[00:56:09.346 --> 00:56:09.846]  Here's an example.
[00:56:10.107 --> 00:56:12.671]  The little one ounce Super Blue bottle is $3.
[00:56:13.172 --> 00:56:15.175]  It has $3 of product and cost in it.
[00:56:16.425 --> 00:56:16.825]  Three dollars!
[00:56:18.006 --> 00:56:22.010]  Leading competitors with something that is even similar, 50 cents in product.
[00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:29.636]  And we sell for $9.95, so that has more than 50% markup, but because there's cost, it's such a low-cost item, you have to have a little bit more than 100% markup.
[00:56:30.277 --> 00:56:34.080]  But that is discounted out of the gates, and it is amazing.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.621]  Disinfects your hands, you name it.
[00:56:35.881 --> 00:56:42.006]  We have the classic, high-quality, 30 parts per million silver bullet, coiled silver, very same stuff that Jeff Bezos sells at Whole Foods for $24.
[00:56:42.807 --> 00:56:43.007]  We're good.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.823]  To go there and get the products you already need that are life-changing, it funds this operation.
[00:56:57.883 --> 00:57:06.489]  It stands in the way of the CNN bullies in Soros and the globalists in Georgetown and the New World Order and the CIA and the leftists that are trying to crush us.
[00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:12.894]  I'm going to go on no matter what happens, but I feel really good under this massive attack because it's like magic.
[00:57:13.034 --> 00:57:16.937]  Every time they attack us, the support comes right in, right at the level we need.
[00:57:17.697 --> 00:57:23.881]  And as a guy that really wants to dominate and win, I just keep thinking, man, I really want a ton more to come in that really takes us over the top.
[00:57:24.481 --> 00:57:26.002]  And it's like, no, you're going to get what you need.
[00:57:26.082 --> 00:57:27.643]  You don't always get what you want, you get what you need.
[00:57:28.063 --> 00:57:30.745]  But we're expanding in the face of this, and they hate it, and they know it.
[00:57:31.045 --> 00:57:32.786]  They know the light of liberty is more popular than ever.
[00:57:32.806 --> 00:57:35.408]  So please, think about us today in footworkstore.com.
[00:57:35.448 --> 00:57:36.928]  And I want to thank you for your financial support.
[00:57:37.209 --> 00:57:39.970]  While you get great products you already need, it is a 360 win.
[00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.212]  You cannot lose unless you don't take action.
[00:57:42.352 --> 00:57:45.954]  But whatever you do, spread the live links to the show online and tell folks about the local stations.
[00:57:47.295 --> 00:57:52.099]  Well, you know, the media has lied about me since the 1960s because I'm a hunter and I'm a gun advocate.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:59.025]  And more and more people are waking up and getting wiser every day, and they're realizing what this fake news thing is all about.
[00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:04.590]  That's why Donald Trump is such an important guy, because he finally put the spotlight on the fake news cockroaches.
[00:58:04.971 --> 00:58:09.295]  And people are getting smarter all the time, and there's more and more support for truth, logic, and common sense.
[00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:10.516]  We celebrate it every damn day.
[00:58:16.641 --> 00:58:20.422]  I think most of the dirtbags on the left hate me because I'm so damn happy.
[00:58:21.262 --> 00:58:23.683]  I mean, I come out here and I got all these bows and arrows.
[00:58:24.003 --> 00:58:28.524]  I literally come out here every day and I take a pink arrow with my name on it.
[00:58:31.145 --> 00:58:33.606]  And I come out here with Chimane and we shoot our bows every day.
[00:58:33.666 --> 00:58:35.266]  We go to the range a lot.
[00:58:35.526 --> 00:58:38.667]  If you don't do it, you can learn something from Ted Nugent.
[00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:39.627]  It is the following.
[00:58:40.687 --> 00:58:42.248]  Get yourself a bow and arrow.
[00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:53.256]  And when you are looking at your target, and you're preparing to draw your bow, it goes all the way back to the origins of Zen.
[00:58:54.997 --> 00:59:07.285]  And the mystical flight of the arrow, right here, tunes out everything liberal, everything democratic, and you become the path of your arrow of life.
[00:59:07.626 --> 00:59:10.167]  I just hit the booger I was aiming at.
[00:59:10.328 --> 00:59:10.948]  Look out!
[00:59:11.108 --> 00:59:11.989]  Alex in the hole!
[00:59:13.188 --> 00:59:15.209]  And it's real touchy trigger, real touchy.
[00:59:15.229 --> 00:59:15.689]  I understand.
[00:59:15.769 --> 00:59:19.190]  Get that top pin in that top peep and squeeze.
[00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.990]  Nicely done.
[00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:23.251]  I'm usually dead on with a bow, but I'm actually sweating because Ted Nugent's watching.
[00:59:23.431 --> 00:59:25.672]  It's like guitars, women, and guns, man.
[00:59:25.732 --> 00:59:27.512]  It's got to be fit for you.
[00:59:28.132 --> 00:59:31.253]  All right, let's see.
[00:59:31.333 --> 00:59:31.633]  Okay.
[00:59:31.713 --> 00:59:35.194]  And just zero that in there and just squeeze that sumbitch.
[00:59:36.695 --> 00:59:37.295]  There you go.
[00:59:37.575 --> 00:59:38.475]  Double lungs, brother.
[00:59:38.795 --> 00:59:39.376]  All right, good.
[00:59:39.396 --> 00:59:40.456]  Back straps have landed.
[00:59:41.115 --> 00:59:42.236]  I'm Ted Nugent, full-time.
[00:59:42.456 --> 00:59:43.977]  Truth is viral.
[00:59:50.601 --> 01:00:01.207]  If you are receiving this translation, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.727 --> 01:00:08.251]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.195 --> 01:00:23.837]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:34.027]  The man known as Count Dankula is more of a liberal, and that's what his profile is to show, liberal libertarian, that doesn't matter.
[01:00:34.948 --> 01:00:42.214]  And a few years ago he did the Hitler dog joke, where he got his dog to say Sieg Heil.
[01:00:43.215 --> 01:00:47.199]  Now Charlie Chaplin did similar jokes, Monty Python did similar jokes,
[01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:49.011]  But does it matter?
[01:00:49.852 --> 01:01:03.076]  Now in the UK, if you teach your dog to howl Hitler and get 10 million views in a day, does it matter even if you're even trending towards kind of anti-fush?
[01:01:03.916 --> 01:01:05.116]  The guy's been on, he's like a liberal.
[01:01:06.517 --> 01:01:08.457]  You get jail time.
[01:01:08.477 --> 01:01:16.620]  The UK court is now saying he's convicted, he's being sentenced, and we're looking to get him to pop in as soon as the sentencing happens today.
[01:01:18.052 --> 01:01:22.637]  He's facing six months in jail and a huge fine for hurting people's feelings.
[01:01:22.677 --> 01:01:27.441]  So, that's how the EU is, restricting laws, restricting free speech, and now that's here.
[01:01:27.762 --> 01:01:29.303]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:29.323 --> 01:01:33.067]  YouTuber convicted for an offensive joke video faces prison.
[01:01:34.388 --> 01:01:35.770]  Can't make that up.
[01:01:36.911 --> 01:01:39.754]  So, without further ado, here's Paul Watson breaking it down from a year ago.
[01:01:41.169 --> 01:01:48.811]  20-year-old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans.
[01:01:49.031 --> 01:01:54.773]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[01:01:55.874 --> 01:02:01.675]  And so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[01:02:03.456 --> 01:02:03.836]  Buddha!
[01:02:04.716 --> 01:02:08.498]  Do you want to gas the juice?
[01:02:08.518 --> 01:02:09.178]  Gas the juice?
[01:02:11.971 --> 01:02:12.272]  Bye!
[01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:15.043]  See you soon!
[01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:16.649]  Bye!
[01:02:27.651 --> 01:02:33.076]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200 thumbs down.
[01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:43.525]  The vast majority of viewers thought that it was hilarious, but thanks to a small minority of perpetually offended retards, Meechan got a home visit from the Scottish police.
[01:02:43.765 --> 01:02:52.053]  Authorities said that Meechan's arrest is a lesson to others that any video content deemed offensive will not be tolerated.
[01:02:52.193 --> 01:02:58.856]  Meechan then prostrated himself, pleading that he wasn't a racist and that he only made the video to annoy his girlfriend.
[01:02:59.016 --> 01:03:03.817]  Isn't it interesting that John Cleese recently came out and decried political correctness?
[01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:10.100]  Because under that definition, Cleese himself would have been arrested for this Fawlty Towers sketch.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:10.860]  Who's this then?
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.581]  Starcuber!
[01:03:12.641 --> 01:03:17.863]  Have you not heard any more?
[01:03:21.769 --> 01:03:25.932]  He would have also been hit with hate crimes charges for this Monty Python sketch.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.524]  Charlie Chaplin would have been thrown in a jail cell for the same reason.
[01:03:42.604 --> 01:03:50.311]  If they're now treating any video content whatsoever that causes offence as hate speech, then my entire channel is hate speech.
[01:03:50.511 --> 01:03:56.757]  It's getting close to where I'm going to have to leave the country simply to continue to make YouTube videos.
[01:03:56.917 --> 01:04:01.421]  They're already arresting people who criticise Muslim immigration on Twitter.
[01:04:01.461 --> 01:04:02.202]  Now satire!
[01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:07.763]  Frigging satire that's not even malicious will not be tolerated.
[01:04:07.883 --> 01:04:09.883]  And this is by no means a one-off case.
[01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:18.245]  Just a few days ago, a Muslim police chief in Manchester said, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture, religion or tradition.
[01:04:18.285 --> 01:04:26.106]  Just last month, Greater Glasgow Police threatened to conduct home visits to harass people who made unkind or inaccurate tweets.
[01:04:26.266 --> 01:04:32.227]  Last year, Police Scotland announced their intention to investigate offensive comments made on Twitter and other social
[01:04:32.227 --> 01:04:33.808]  Oh, we're going to go on a break.
[01:04:33.848 --> 01:04:35.728]  The full report is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:38.589]  But they are now banning anti-Nazis making Nazi jokes.
[01:05:03.729 --> 01:05:05.810]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:14.453]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[01:05:14.813 --> 01:05:17.354]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[01:05:17.774 --> 01:05:21.275]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[01:05:21.595 --> 01:05:22.676]  We need your help.
[01:05:28.726 --> 01:05:35.949]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:36.429 --> 01:05:45.572]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[01:05:45.853 --> 01:05:50.954]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[01:05:51.235 --> 01:05:54.076]  It also funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:57.137]  Icarin, available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:14.247 --> 01:06:21.712]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:30.698]  Alexander Nikrasov is going to be joining us for the next 30 minutes from Russia.
[01:06:31.278 --> 01:06:31.879]  He is a
[01:06:34.141 --> 01:06:38.527]  TV presenter, researcher, host, he's all over BBC, you name it, U.S.
[01:06:38.547 --> 01:06:40.510]  television, a lot of people will recognize him.
[01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:48.881]  And I wanted to get him on about Putin's big landslide election, with 76 plus percent running as an independent, because I saw U.S.
[01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:50.663]  media saying Putin's a dictator.
[01:06:51.977 --> 01:07:01.929]  But they won't say that the Chinese president is elected by the Communist Party, the Central Committee, the Politburo, and that the Communist Party holds dictatorship since 1949.
[01:07:02.149 --> 01:07:04.071]  They've killed 80 plus million people.
[01:07:04.952 --> 01:07:07.155]  And then the party holds all power in the country.
[01:07:08.584 --> 01:07:15.169]  And then Putin ran as an independent, they have a parliamentary system, they had a general election, and he's now been re-elected.
[01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:20.193]  When you're elected, and even mainstream, some US news admits he's very popular in polls.
[01:07:20.213 --> 01:07:21.194]  In fact, they thought he might get 80%.
[01:07:22.114 --> 01:07:30.360]  So this isn't some Russophile thing I'm involved in, where if you're not anti-Russia, you know, you're a communist agent or something.
[01:07:31.301 --> 01:07:34.564]  It's the globalists, in my view, that are acting like the old Soviet Union.
[01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:39.047]  It's the EU that's unelected, and Juncker is unelected, but then he calls Putin the dictator.
[01:07:40.429 --> 01:07:46.233]  So, Alexander joins us, Alexander Nekrasov, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:49.476]  He's a former Kremlin and government advisor, Russian journalist and broadcaster.
[01:07:49.496 --> 01:07:56.722]  He's a regular grandson of the famous giant of Russian poetry, and a nephew of Leo Tolstoy.
[01:07:57.162 --> 01:08:02.326]  He is a frequent commentator on various international TV channels and radio as well as British, American and Russian media.
[01:08:02.607 --> 01:08:04.848]  He's an expert on international relations.
[01:08:05.509 --> 01:08:11.074]  Alexander first worked at TASS in the Soviet press agency, first as a reporter and then it just goes through all the things he's done.
[01:08:11.714 --> 01:08:14.236]  And we'll put up his Twitter on screen for you.
[01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:19.160]  You can also follow him at Twitter at StirringTroubleWithTwoRs.
[01:08:19.501 --> 01:08:21.562]  So he joins us now.
[01:08:21.682 --> 01:08:22.984]  Alexander, good to have you on with us.
[01:08:24.144 --> 01:08:25.145]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:08:26.105 --> 01:08:29.167]  Well, a few words about Putin's election because it just happened.
[01:08:55.254 --> 01:09:02.041]  And first of all, I'd like to say that, you know, elections in every country have problems, right?
[01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:08.987]  For example, I live in Britain, and in Britain, you don't need to show your ID when you're voting.
[01:09:09.007 --> 01:09:12.911]  Now, when I say this to people from other countries, they don't believe me.
[01:09:13.912 --> 01:09:16.935]  And, you know, when anyone can take the
[01:09:17.782 --> 01:09:29.469]  piece of paper you've been sent to come into the, you know, for voting center and just simply say, hi, I am this guy or this woman and vote and just leave.
[01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:32.370]  You must understand there's something wrong with it, right?
[01:09:33.271 --> 01:09:38.834]  Now, we can go through many elections across the world, including the West, by the way.
[01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:45.858]  For example, last year in France, Macron, who nobody knew, and I have friends in France, my father was born in France,
[01:09:46.519 --> 01:09:47.260]  My late father.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:52.384]  And I can tell you, nobody knew who he was, where his party came from.
[01:09:52.904 --> 01:09:55.766]  That party consisted of some very strange people.
[01:09:56.607 --> 01:10:02.411]  And suddenly they got two thirds of Parliament and he won very convincingly.
[01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:05.313]  Now, you know, call me naive.
[01:10:05.814 --> 01:10:07.295]  I don't understand how that works.
[01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.773]  The EU was sort of standing aside and saying, well, we don't know.
[01:10:12.154 --> 01:10:12.714]  We don't know.
[01:10:12.774 --> 01:10:13.975]  It's democracy, you see.
[01:10:14.556 --> 01:10:20.381]  So what I'm saying here, of course there are problems with every election in every country.
[01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:26.306]  And of course there are officials on the ground who would like to, you know, to do something.
[01:10:26.326 --> 01:10:28.668]  To put their finger on the scale.
[01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:32.691]  Yeah, you know, to please the bosses upstairs.
[01:10:33.352 --> 01:10:35.154]  And of course there will be something happening.
[01:10:36.346 --> 01:10:39.947]  In Putin's, in case of Putin, one thing that must be understood.
[01:10:40.727 --> 01:10:43.568]  Russia is in a very difficult situation now.
[01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:50.871]  For the first time in many, many decades, foreign troops, NATO troops, are on its border.
[01:10:51.611 --> 01:10:52.351]  On its border.
[01:10:52.391 --> 01:10:57.233]  This is not, you know, somewhere in Germany or Britain or France.
[01:10:57.433 --> 01:11:01.074]  They are now on its border, all along the eastern border.
[01:11:01.795 --> 01:11:09.083]  There are troops even in Ukraine, which has always been seen by the Russians as basically a brotherly nation.
[01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:17.228]  And what happened in Ukraine, I must tell you, probably spoiled relations with the West, well, for the next hundred years.
[01:11:17.248 --> 01:11:32.262]  Sure, I mean, Soros brags, he went in there, he said on Fareed Zarkaria, they spent $5 billion, State Department money, a billion of his, to overthrow the government, then to try to take over the oil fields and gas fields, and to start a civil war, they put admitted Nazis, and how Hitler,
[01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:33.103]  I don't know.
[01:11:48.963 --> 01:11:56.171]  Russia has general elections, it's a parliamentary system, and if you dig into State Department reports, they admit they thought Putin would win with 80%.
[01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.194]  So he won with 76%, correct?
[01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:02.238]  So the point is, that's not a dictator when you're elected with 76%.
[01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:15.904]  Well, I agree with that, but the most important thing of all is that you can have a democratic election, like you have in some countries, but you must judge the election by the impact it has on the country.
[01:12:16.404 --> 01:12:21.706]  You know, it's all very nice to say, well, people decided they have this leader or that leader.
[01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:24.247]  Watch what happens after that.
[01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:30.010]  Is the leader, the government, the regime, is acting in the interest of the people?
[01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:35.793]  Or is it acting in the interest of a tiny clique of people and ignores the rest?
[01:12:36.213 --> 01:12:37.814]  Now that's the real issue.
[01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.656]  And so why do Russians like Putin?
[01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:42.797]  And why do they keep re-electing him in record numbers?
[01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.799]  Because like my grandpa always said, I don't want to hear talk, I want to see action.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.321]  Judge a tree by its fruit, as the Bible says.
[01:12:48.621 --> 01:12:50.883]  So why do Russians love Putin so much?
[01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:55.467]  Well, I think it's not love, it's pragmatism.
[01:12:55.647 --> 01:13:06.494]  I think they understand that Putin probably is the best candidate of them all to provide security for the country, because security is the number one issue on the agenda now.
[01:13:07.395 --> 01:13:12.959]  Secondly, none of the candidates were really strong in offering any new
[01:13:17.264 --> 01:13:17.764]  Sure, sure.
[01:13:17.804 --> 01:13:22.106]  So why does the West, why does the Western left in Hollywood hate Putin so much?
[01:13:22.426 --> 01:13:23.386]  I mean, for me, I know why.
[01:13:23.446 --> 01:13:23.846]  I know them.
[01:13:24.186 --> 01:13:27.267]  You know, the Bolsheviks and things kind of got run out of New York and London.
[01:13:27.587 --> 01:13:29.548]  That's where Bernie Sanders went and had his honeymoon.
[01:13:29.568 --> 01:13:32.289]  And I know you were previously in that whole system, but I think it's...
[01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:32.949]  Pretty horrible.
[01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.789]  I think what Putin's doing in many ways is good.
[01:13:34.809 --> 01:13:36.090]  The Christianity, the free market.
[01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:37.130]  I like the reform.
[01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:44.151]  So, that's why I see Hollywood and the left seeing their little wonderland of stomping Christians' guts out, being taken away from them.
[01:13:45.611 --> 01:13:51.392]  Well, I mean, Hollywood hates Putin, hates Russia, hates anybody who is not a liberal.
[01:13:52.092 --> 01:13:53.593]  Let's be honest about it.
[01:13:53.913 --> 01:13:59.554]  Hollywood is in a sense a suspect of neoliberalism, you know, militant liberalism.
[01:13:59.574 --> 01:14:01.134]  No, it's neoliberal cancer, exactly.
[01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:03.415]  Yes, it's militant now.
[01:14:03.735 --> 01:14:04.776]  It's gone over the top.
[01:14:05.296 --> 01:14:10.360]  So I wouldn't really judge what Hollywood is saying.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.383]  But you know it's Hollywood driving the foaming at the mouth Russia hate.
[01:14:16.884 --> 01:14:19.806]  Well, unfortunately, you know a lot of people in the West
[01:14:20.547 --> 01:14:24.610]  Are very influenced by film, by film movies, by television.
[01:14:25.011 --> 01:14:31.656]  People in the West generally are brought up to believe in things that we, you know, the Russians, we love.
[01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:33.458]  Yeah, we get our image of Russians from Hollywood.
[01:14:33.478 --> 01:14:39.643]  There's a new movie like Red Sparrow every month where Russians are running around murdering everybody in the US.
[01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:43.786]  But instead, it's the globalists, it's Hollywood, it's the EU, it's the devil pope.
[01:14:44.106 --> 01:14:47.109]  They're the ones that are trying to destroy me right now.
[01:14:47.509 --> 01:14:53.750]  There's not any Russians involved anywhere with me, except for Daria, who worked for Army Special Operations as a patriot.
[01:14:54.151 --> 01:14:59.652]  That's how sick this is, is I judge a tree by my fruits, and I have globalists trying to destroy my country.
[01:14:59.892 --> 01:15:01.672]  The same globalists that want to destroy you.
[01:15:03.133 --> 01:15:08.574]  Well, the problem is here, of course, because there is a reason why Russia is considered an enemy.
[01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:13.955]  First of all, there is a lot of distraction going on from the problems at home.
[01:15:14.778 --> 01:15:24.267]  Now the economy, for example, in Britain, where the spying scandal is all over the pages of the press, the economy is in terrible shape.
[01:15:24.908 --> 01:15:30.153]  The corruption in politics has become such that I would compare it to Zimbabwe.
[01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:38.047]  Things are happening that I don't believe happened in Russia in the worst times of the 1990s under Yeltsin.
[01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:38.567]  This is key.
[01:15:38.587 --> 01:15:39.168]  Stay right there.
[01:15:39.788 --> 01:15:49.575]  Let's explain this when we come back and the fact that even today Russia is in a battle just like America with the very same foaming at the mouth liberals that want our kids, our culture, our churches.
[01:15:49.655 --> 01:15:51.276]  I mean, they want to conquer us.
[01:15:51.696 --> 01:15:53.558]  We'll be back with our special guest from Russia.
[01:15:53.578 --> 01:15:53.978]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.404 --> 01:16:11.671]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:20.255]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:21.676 --> 01:16:24.177]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:28.418]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:29.359 --> 01:16:31.520]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.422]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:40.343 --> 01:16:46.965]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:47.926 --> 01:16:48.886]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:50.313 --> 01:16:57.166]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:16:57.667 --> 01:16:58.970]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:00.152 --> 01:17:01.495]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:03.482 --> 01:17:14.408]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:15.108 --> 01:17:16.649]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:28.976]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:29.556 --> 01:17:31.738]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:41.785]  Then I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:42.345 --> 01:17:47.769]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:56.755]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:17:59.011 --> 01:18:07.278]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:07.799 --> 01:18:09.240]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:10.241 --> 01:18:12.904]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:13.704 --> 01:18:15.526]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:20.470]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:21.551 --> 01:18:32.348]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:32.388 --> 01:18:36.354]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:38.415]  Our game changing.
[01:18:38.835 --> 01:18:40.336]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[01:18:40.556 --> 01:18:43.118]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[01:18:43.498 --> 01:18:44.659]  The other equation of probiotic.
[01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:48.281]  It's now stronger and a lower price in PolarStore.com.
[01:18:48.601 --> 01:18:49.702]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[01:18:49.782 --> 01:18:54.145]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:57.728]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:18:57.828 --> 01:18:59.049]  It just does incredible things.
[01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:00.930]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:03.932]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:06.474]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:07.014 --> 01:19:11.817]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:12.437 --> 01:19:23.584]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[01:19:24.024 --> 01:19:30.928]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[01:19:30.968 --> 01:19:32.069]  It's a disinfectant for the hands,
[01:19:32.589 --> 01:19:33.990]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:35.371]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:42.074]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:19:42.374 --> 01:19:43.755]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:43.775 --> 01:19:53.380]  So, thank you all for remembering InfoWarsStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.742]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:00.698 --> 01:20:04.861]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.132 --> 01:20:27.456]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:31.912]  Alexander Nekrasov is a journalist.
[01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:32.712]  He's in London.
[01:20:32.772 --> 01:20:36.556]  But when I say the view from Russia, I mean a Russian's view on what's going on.
[01:20:37.356 --> 01:20:41.379]  And again, I've never been to Russia, but I've been a history buff.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:46.363]  And I do intend to probably go there in the later summer now because I've got to get my Achilles fixed soon.
[01:20:47.204 --> 01:20:49.846]  It's 100% blown now, and I've just been walking on it for four years.
[01:20:49.866 --> 01:20:50.947]  It's only 80% blown.
[01:20:51.307 --> 01:20:54.370]  But I'm going to go to Russia because I want to go see who my bosses supposedly are.
[01:20:55.091 --> 01:20:56.231]  It's ridiculous.
[01:20:57.513 --> 01:21:00.235]  And, again, he's an expert in international relations.
[01:21:00.995 --> 01:21:02.316]  He's joining us.
[01:21:02.356 --> 01:21:16.247]  He's covered many of the big events, like what he was getting into the early 1990s, Yeltsin attacking the Duma and the Parliament with tanks when they wouldn't leave, and go with the election, and then the rise of Putin, and just all the things we've seen in our age.
[01:21:16.708 --> 01:21:21.331]  And then NATO double-crossing and then going up on the Russian borders.
[01:21:21.772 --> 01:21:22.793]  That's really what happened.
[01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:26.476]  And again, that's from my perspective, just looking at what goes on.
[01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:36.604]  Our media is so fake that when Georgia attacked South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 888, our media said Russia has attacked Georgia.
[01:21:36.664 --> 01:21:39.086]  And I believed CNN when I got up at 6 a.m.
[01:21:39.707 --> 01:21:47.714]  Until about two hours in, I was reading foreign news and it was like, no, the Georgians attacked these areas that were UN-held, killed a bunch of people.
[01:21:47.994 --> 01:21:49.876]  The Russians just pushed them out and then left.
[01:21:50.891 --> 01:21:55.615]  So, that's when I became the Russophile, according to the media, when I went.
[01:21:56.116 --> 01:21:57.176]  CNN lied.
[01:21:58.017 --> 01:21:59.759]  Russia didn't start that.
[01:22:00.734 --> 01:22:03.856]  And that's when I realized, my God, they're really trying to start a new Cold War.
[01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:06.618]  Well, if they were communist over there, that'd be another thing.
[01:22:06.858 --> 01:22:09.540]  We need a Cold War with Hollywood, with the Democratic Party.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.821]  They're the enemy, man.
[01:22:10.881 --> 01:22:11.841]  Get them out of here.
[01:22:12.482 --> 01:22:13.743]  Stop them culturally.
[01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.984]  They're the enemy, not the Russians.
[01:22:16.024 --> 01:22:22.649]  And the globalists are allied with the communist Chinese, who just made him dictator for life with his vice president.
[01:22:22.949 --> 01:22:29.433]  But the Austin American statesman said elected president, elected vice president by the permanent communist party.
[01:22:29.833 --> 01:22:30.594]  Putin was not.
[01:22:30.834 --> 01:22:32.035]  So I just don't like the lies.
[01:22:32.095 --> 01:22:34.897]  And if you could get into that, I know you've got some of your own issues you want to get into.
[01:22:35.277 --> 01:22:40.260]  What this meeting with Trump and Putin may look like from your expert perspective, Alexander?
[01:22:41.821 --> 01:22:51.767]  Well, I think it's not going to be easy because there's going to be pressure on Trump in America from people who don't like Russia and don't want to have anything to do with Russia.
[01:22:52.107 --> 01:23:00.372]  And I can tell you, Alex, last week in New York, you had the biggest gathering of experts on Russia, you know, from the West.
[01:23:01.033 --> 01:23:02.934]  And guess what they've decided in New York?
[01:23:03.314 --> 01:23:06.755]  They've decided that Russia is an enemy of the West.
[01:23:07.255 --> 01:23:09.556]  It should be destroyed and so on and so on.
[01:23:09.876 --> 01:23:11.277]  So that's the experts.
[01:23:11.577 --> 01:23:13.878]  Experts are talking about Russia.
[01:23:14.218 --> 01:23:17.379]  So you can imagine the pressures on both presidents.
[01:23:17.799 --> 01:23:20.320]  In Russia, there are people who do not trust America.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.580]  I can tell you this, even in power.
[01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.741]  And they will say, look, we can't trust these guys.
[01:23:26.181 --> 01:23:27.442]  They took over Ukraine.
[01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.302]  They are surrounding us.
[01:23:29.862 --> 01:23:31.403]  They are meddling in our affairs.
[01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:36.904]  They are making up stories that we are hacking their elections and so on.
[01:23:37.284 --> 01:23:44.346]  And at the same time, the budget of the CIA is 20 times more than the budget of the Russian intelligence service.
[01:23:44.726 --> 01:23:46.086]  They are lying to their people.
[01:23:46.126 --> 01:23:47.086]  They are attacking us.
[01:23:47.126 --> 01:23:50.027]  They are waging a cyber war against us and so on.
[01:23:50.507 --> 01:23:56.113]  So you can imagine both of them will be under great pressure to basically agree on anything.
[01:23:56.133 --> 01:24:03.621]  I don't really think it's going to be a big decision making meeting, but it has a big symbolism under it.
[01:24:04.101 --> 01:24:05.503]  And I think it's very important.
[01:24:05.523 --> 01:24:06.364]  They need to talk.
[01:24:06.864 --> 01:24:08.805]  You know, these leaders need to talk.
[01:24:09.225 --> 01:24:16.529]  This is very good that they are going to meet one-on-one because I don't trust those summits, you know?
[01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:22.533]  They get together, they don't do much there, they do their own thing there, and nothing is decided.
[01:24:23.353 --> 01:24:43.013]  I think President Trump and President Putin should throw the gauntlet down and statistically expose who's really involved in things and what the globalists are doing and point out that Russia has all these resources, wants to be modernized, wants to work with us, and has sent all those signals and helped us after 9-11 and helped us take out ISIS.
[01:24:43.653 --> 01:24:45.314]  And Trump's very pragmatic, I can tell you.
[01:24:45.334 --> 01:24:46.755]  There are people that know Trump very well.
[01:24:47.435 --> 01:24:49.937]  And he absolutely thinks this is a load of crap.
[01:24:50.577 --> 01:24:52.679]  He doesn't want to be in conflict with Russia.
[01:24:53.639 --> 01:24:56.601]  And a lot of the military says we should work with Russia.
[01:24:56.901 --> 01:24:58.582]  Geographically, it's a match made in heaven.
[01:24:59.082 --> 01:25:02.084]  But the globalists, the neocons, they want to control the chessboard.
[01:25:02.424 --> 01:25:04.786]  They want to control radical Islam, flood Europe with that.
[01:25:05.146 --> 01:25:07.047]  They want to control Russia, cut Russia off.
[01:25:07.347 --> 01:25:09.829]  And the globalists want to destroy the power of America.
[01:25:10.129 --> 01:25:15.412]  They want to phase our power into this global corporate system that threatens Russia and the United States.
[01:25:15.692 --> 01:25:18.513]  I think that's why we have to not be intimidated to have these meetings.
[01:25:18.793 --> 01:25:19.193]  I agree.
[01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:26.017]  Trump should have met with Putin first since they made such a big deal about it and kill it right there and say it's not wrong.
[01:25:26.157 --> 01:25:26.797]  I'm the president.
[01:25:27.117 --> 01:25:27.997]  You elected me.
[01:25:28.598 --> 01:25:30.639]  I'm allowed to talk and work with whoever I want.
[01:25:30.919 --> 01:25:31.859]  Unitary executive.
[01:25:32.119 --> 01:25:37.002]  They're saying Mueller and CNN holds the president's fate like he's the fourth branch of government.
[01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:37.382]  No!
[01:25:37.982 --> 01:25:46.766]  No, even if Trump was caught doing stuff with the Russians, which we know wasn't true, it's still his right and the people's right to say we want our president to talk to this group or that group.
[01:25:47.086 --> 01:26:04.993]  Paralyzing the president with this whole Russiagate canard to where we can't work with Russia and then bully us in a new Cold War is the height of criminal activity and instead of giving in to the fear and virtue signaling, we need to call it out for what it is, an absolute fraud by the real enemies of the world and that's the globalists.
[01:26:06.377 --> 01:26:14.942]  Well, the problem with the American public is that a lot of people in America believe the media too much, and unfortunately the world of entertainment as well.
[01:26:15.382 --> 01:26:24.127]  And I can tell you that a lot of you Americans think that what they see on Saturday Night Live is actually real politics.
[01:26:24.627 --> 01:26:33.372]  And they make their decision based on that stupid, idiotic, I think, comedy series where nobody even bothers to act, by the way.
[01:26:33.412 --> 01:26:35.954]  If you notice, they can't even remember their lines.
[01:26:36.613 --> 01:26:45.879]  And the world of entertainment, I think there's a lot of responsibility in America, I mean, for the feelings of some people towards Russia.
[01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:49.441]  You just mentioned Red Sparrow, but is it just Red Sparrow?
[01:26:49.681 --> 01:26:53.844]  I mean, how many films have depicted Russians as spies, killers?
[01:26:54.464 --> 01:26:55.805]  What about the Russian Mafia?
[01:26:56.105 --> 01:26:57.686]  Where the hell is the Russian Mafia?
[01:26:57.986 --> 01:27:00.088]  I have investigated the Russian Mafia.
[01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.149]  There is no Russian Mafia in the West.
[01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:03.370]  That's the point.
[01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:07.533]  But they have those films, one after another, one after another.
[01:27:07.913 --> 01:27:09.975]  Russian mafia, the killers, gangsters.
[01:27:10.215 --> 01:27:11.376]  They're all over America.
[01:27:11.416 --> 01:27:12.517]  They're threatening everyone.
[01:27:12.777 --> 01:27:13.318]  Excuse me.
[01:27:13.778 --> 01:27:17.821]  Most of the gangsters come from the Mexican part of the border, you know?
[01:27:18.802 --> 01:27:19.643]  Where are the Russians?
[01:27:19.703 --> 01:27:27.009]  But unfortunately, you know, from the early age, they watch the books, they watch those films, and that's how this
[01:27:27.529 --> 01:27:30.831]  This trust, this hatred for Russia is developing.
[01:27:31.131 --> 01:27:36.953]  And I think we should all tell our children, I've been telling my children, you know, don't trust those things.
[01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:38.454]  Don't trust those films.
[01:27:38.814 --> 01:27:39.674]  This is all rubbish.
[01:27:39.714 --> 01:27:40.655]  They're all pretending.
[01:27:40.975 --> 01:27:42.236]  This is not the truth.
[01:27:42.596 --> 01:27:44.136]  But Americans don't do that.
[01:27:44.637 --> 01:27:52.500]  And you produce some of the most, not you personally, of course, but the American TV industry and Hollywood, some of the most disgusting
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.785]  Well, that's why I said Hollywood, because it's not just the neoliberals, the neocons.
[01:27:59.085 --> 01:28:03.168]  The engine of the hate and the propaganda for it is Hollywood.
[01:28:03.448 --> 01:28:08.332]  And they're the same people demonizing Christians, conservatives, libertarians, rural communities.
[01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:12.695]  This is a conquering elite that sees any form of independence as the enemy.
[01:28:13.195 --> 01:28:21.742]  And now that Russia has pulled out of a place that Bernie Sanders would want to vacation, that's why Russia is now seen as the existential threat.
[01:28:22.903 --> 01:28:27.841]  Alex, the problem with America is that your conservative movement is very weak.
[01:28:28.343 --> 01:28:28.684]  It's very
[01:28:29.891 --> 01:28:32.432]  No, you know, it's weak.
[01:28:32.912 --> 01:28:40.374]  And you have demagogues pretending to be Republicans or Conservatives or Christians talking absolute rubbish.
[01:28:40.974 --> 01:28:43.035]  And people think they're Conservatives.
[01:28:43.335 --> 01:28:45.335]  There's a lot of problems, for example.
[01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:45.795]  No, I agree.
[01:28:45.815 --> 01:28:50.657]  I'm going to get your perspective, the Russian-slash-UK perspective, with this straight ahead.
[01:28:50.677 --> 01:28:51.097]  Stay with us.
[01:28:51.157 --> 01:28:55.178]  One more segment, and Roger Stone will give us the inside details on Mueller and the latest.
[01:28:56.567 --> 01:29:04.230]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:09.171]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:29:09.672 --> 01:29:12.032]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:29:12.813 --> 01:29:15.934]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:29.586]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:29:30.286 --> 01:29:45.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:29:46.337 --> 01:29:50.042]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[01:29:50.603 --> 01:29:52.306]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.589]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:29:58.001 --> 01:30:15.949]  We are joined via Skype from Japan by Steven Seagal, the famous actor and of course famous black belt in martial arts, a friend of Vladimir Putin, of course a friend of President Trump, a friend of so many, and of course a well-known American patriot.
[01:30:16.349 --> 01:30:20.952]  Who we noticed has been demonized in the press quite a bit as of late.
[01:30:21.173 --> 01:30:28.017]  Steven Seagal has also now written a best-selling book dealing with the wolves of the deep state.
[01:30:28.117 --> 01:30:31.200]  Dealing with all the incredible things that are happening.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:40.826]  And Steven Seagal, because of his close relationship with President Putin, and because he's been a peacemaker, and because he's been a goodwill ambassador, because his
[01:30:41.947 --> 01:30:50.317]  Obviously there are women who have really been assaulted.
[01:30:50.958 --> 01:30:59.709]  And as a police officer for many years, you know, I saw this and was honored and able to help people who were in real distress, real trouble.
[01:31:01.286 --> 01:31:06.092]  We want nothing more than to be able to defend those people and help them.
[01:31:06.713 --> 01:31:17.567]  The thing that is an evil tragedy that is going on now is, like I said, people paying people to lie.
[01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:35.394]  For their own political agenda and because maybe they want to assassinate their enemy and destroy their name and reputation and family and family lives and marriage and ability to earn money.
[01:31:36.175 --> 01:31:37.275]  There are a million reasons.
[01:31:37.799 --> 01:31:48.383]  There's a woman called Michelle Milken who stood up and said, listen, when people make claims, they lie.
[01:31:48.983 --> 01:31:50.764]  They lie for multiple reasons.
[01:31:50.824 --> 01:31:54.865]  They lie because they want to annihilate their enemies.
[01:31:55.265 --> 01:31:56.406]  They lie for money.
[01:31:56.426 --> 01:31:59.167]  They lie because they want to become famous and get in the news.
[01:32:00.087 --> 01:32:03.550]  And, you know, she said, I'm not just making this up.
[01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:23.366]  I'm the one who's gotten into the FBI files, and the NAO files, and law enforcement files, and I've gone over all the statistics, and I can tell you, by my research, my meticulous analytical research, I can tell you that up to 40% of these claims are fake.
[01:32:24.087 --> 01:32:28.410]  Well, I personally think in Hollywood, right now, it's a lot bigger number.
[01:32:28.911 --> 01:32:29.071]  So,
[01:32:29.941 --> 01:32:41.789]  What I'm saying is, and I've said before, what some of these people don't realize is, this is part of a plan to collapse the United States of America.
[01:32:41.829 --> 01:32:49.494]  Because if the news becomes faker and faker, we won't know, the people will not know what's real and what's really happening.
[01:32:49.554 --> 01:32:53.377]  If the people don't know what's really happening, what do we have, Alex?
[01:33:00.094 --> 01:33:02.677]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.682 --> 01:33:16.563]  By the way, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:33:16.603 --> 01:33:37.632]  When I tell you you get tomorrow's news today, we've told you it's pressure bombs, and he's using mousetraps, and he's using the green belts, and that's all starting to come out, and we told you that all these companies do this data mining that you heard about with this British company, and this British company has hundreds of clients, liberal, conservative, African, European, all over the globe.
[01:33:38.917 --> 01:33:43.640]  And that Facebook and others were in deep trouble now that the media had finally reported on this?
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.021]  Because now it's going to implode the whole thing.
[01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:49.463]  Now their stock's down $40 billion and here's the Guardian.
[01:33:51.023 --> 01:33:51.864]  Utterly horrifying.
[01:33:51.964 --> 01:33:53.705]  Ex-Facebook employee insider.
[01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:55.866]  Covert data harvesting was routine.
[01:33:56.837 --> 01:34:10.107]  Yes, what they claim this pink-haired genius did was a standard data mine indexing the information, then using the original people they harvested to then create accounts and go out and reach out and create a community.
[01:34:10.528 --> 01:34:11.929]  That's what the left does.
[01:34:11.969 --> 01:34:13.850]  It's what Facebook and Twitter and YouTube is.
[01:34:14.431 --> 01:34:15.932]  Here's the former head of the Clinton campaign.
[01:34:15.952 --> 01:34:17.673]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:18.394 --> 01:34:22.577]  Obama's former campaign director makes a bombshell claim.
[01:34:22.637 --> 01:34:23.798]  Facebook was on our side.
[01:34:25.131 --> 01:34:26.132]  I was saying Hillary earlier.
[01:34:26.172 --> 01:34:27.873]  There's another Hillary person saying the same thing.
[01:34:27.893 --> 01:34:29.814]  And it's just crazy.
[01:34:30.354 --> 01:34:34.877]  So, I'm not the tech guy, but I study what the top people say.
[01:34:35.578 --> 01:34:40.541]  And it's just crazy how they limitedly try to go after Trump.
[01:34:41.001 --> 01:34:46.505]  Okay, let's go back to Alexander Nekrasov, who's a journalist in the UK.
[01:34:47.025 --> 01:34:49.707]  And he has been a former Kremlin and government insider.
[01:34:50.708 --> 01:34:52.429]  And just in the few minutes we have left,
[01:34:53.357 --> 01:35:16.271]  I want to pragmatically then, he was getting back to what Russia was like 20 years ago or 15, 16 years ago and what it's like now and where he sees Russia going and any hopes or ways for the United States and Russia to be able to expose this neoliberalism for what it is, this globalism that's waging war against the nation-state, against families, against Western civilization.
[01:35:16.931 --> 01:35:19.053]  I'm not putting words in his mouth, the globalists say
[01:35:19.753 --> 01:35:21.014]  They're against Western civilization.
[01:35:21.034 --> 01:35:22.314]  We can say Russia isn't really Western.
[01:35:22.334 --> 01:35:26.676]  Well, it really is Western, if you call Christian being Western.
[01:35:26.716 --> 01:35:30.478]  So Alexander, if you guys can send him the food, thanks.
[01:35:31.758 --> 01:35:34.720]  Alexander, how can we hope to turn this around?
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.600]  Any other closing comments?
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.601]  I appreciate you coming on today.
[01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:41.371]  Right.
[01:35:41.491 --> 01:35:43.132]  I didn't hear the previous conversation.
[01:35:43.172 --> 01:35:43.632]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:43.672 --> 01:35:45.013]  I think somebody was talking to you.
[01:35:46.454 --> 01:35:49.816]  How do we short circuit this whole globalist operation?
[01:35:50.136 --> 01:35:53.758]  How do we somehow get people to realize this whole Russia thing really is a hoax?
[01:35:55.549 --> 01:36:05.137]  Well, it's going to be a tough one, because unfortunately, as I started saying, the liberal camp, the neoliberals, are so united.
[01:36:05.637 --> 01:36:07.318]  They are so tribal.
[01:36:07.739 --> 01:36:12.903]  And unfortunately, the conservatives in America and the West generally are so divided.
[01:36:13.403 --> 01:36:22.792]  There's so much confusion, there's so many demagogues who pretend to be conservatives, but actually drag the people completely in a different direction.
[01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:26.055]  So it will be a hell of a struggle to do this.
[01:36:26.135 --> 01:36:35.443]  And unfortunately, I must accept this as well, Alex, that Putin and his crowd sometimes do and say things that are not great.
[01:36:35.883 --> 01:36:38.924]  You know, as a public relations exercise, I would say.
[01:36:39.444 --> 01:36:45.566]  And I think there has to be more cooperation in the sense that I was a troubleshooter for the Kremlin.
[01:36:46.046 --> 01:36:48.226]  And my job was to fix things.
[01:36:48.727 --> 01:36:55.909]  My job was to go behind the scenes and basically resolve the problems before the big boys were meeting.
[01:36:56.269 --> 01:37:00.030]  We don't have those fixes anymore, like, you know, the troubleshooters.
[01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:02.890]  They need to be more, you know, involved in this.
[01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:04.671]  There need to be more people like that.
[01:37:05.151 --> 01:37:10.876]  Going back and forth between America and Russia, talking, you know, finding out solutions.
[01:37:11.276 --> 01:37:12.397]  I don't see that happening.
[01:37:12.497 --> 01:37:23.566]  I see those idiots from the State Department and those fools from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Russia telling all sorts of silly things, you know, to their leaders.
[01:37:24.147 --> 01:37:26.229]  And that's why I think there is a problem.
[01:37:26.449 --> 01:37:27.590]  It will take time.
[01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:30.592]  Unfortunately, it will take a lot of time.
[01:37:30.893 --> 01:37:32.394]  But I hope, I hope,
[01:37:32.774 --> 01:37:36.456]  That both Trump and Putin, they are strong people.
[01:37:36.836 --> 01:37:50.064]  You know, whatever people say about them, whatever, you know, the lies and so on, I think they're tough when it comes to negotiations, but they're also tough when you need a decision.
[01:37:50.545 --> 01:37:53.726]  And I'm hoping that together, they might crack it.
[01:37:54.127 --> 01:37:56.108]  But it will be a hell of a job.
[01:37:56.308 --> 01:37:57.189]  I mean, honestly.
[01:37:57.869 --> 01:38:00.851]  Alexander, why do you think, just as individuals,
[01:38:01.727 --> 01:38:07.991]  Why do you think the globalists, the leftists, the anti-family crowd, why do they hate Putin?
[01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:09.292]  Why do they hate Trump?
[01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:11.013]  Well, I've met them.
[01:38:11.073 --> 01:38:11.513]  I know them.
[01:38:11.573 --> 01:38:12.554]  They hate families.
[01:38:13.094 --> 01:38:14.395]  Almost none of them have children.
[01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.956]  They tell you they hate your children.
[01:38:16.336 --> 01:38:18.737]  I mean, they're just really nasty, demonic people.
[01:38:19.298 --> 01:38:25.001]  And I hate to boil it down to that, because I've been on air 23 years, and until the last five or so, that wasn't what I harped on.
[01:38:25.061 --> 01:38:27.523]  But now, when you get down to final equations,
[01:38:28.649 --> 01:38:30.533]  These are just really, really bad people.
[01:38:30.553 --> 01:38:38.832]  I mean, can you give your perspective on why the whole leftist global movement hates Russia, hates the United States, hates Putin, hates Trump?
[01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:44.415]  Well, I think you've mentioned that point correctly.
[01:38:44.815 --> 01:38:56.239]  I think, first of all, the values that Putin and Trump stand for, you know, God, Christianity, this they hate, because that's the thing they hate.
[01:38:56.519 --> 01:39:07.322]  And don't forget that the international globalists and neoliberals, I call them militant neoliberals, because they have gone over the top now, I think they hate
[01:39:08.222 --> 01:39:12.926]  Unlike the previous old days, you know, the Cold War, they hate the Russian people.
[01:39:13.286 --> 01:39:15.628]  Not just the leadership, but the Russian people.
[01:39:15.708 --> 01:39:17.490]  Big difference with the Cold War.
[01:39:17.770 --> 01:39:18.090]  Why?
[01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:22.213]  Because the Russian people do not accept their vile agendas.
[01:39:22.814 --> 01:39:24.135]  And they hate them for that.
[01:39:24.495 --> 01:39:26.237]  They just want to destroy them for that.
[01:39:26.497 --> 01:39:30.500]  Because they can't understand how somebody, you know, can't accept
[01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:41.615]  You see, the problem with a lot of Western people, they've been brought up to believe that political correctness is part of free speech and democracy.
[01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:47.419]  Political correctness is exactly the opposite of free speech and democracy.
[01:39:48.067 --> 01:39:52.969]  Further on, in your part of the woods, people say liberal democracy.
[01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:54.870]  We have a liberal democracy.
[01:39:55.090 --> 01:40:00.052]  Well, excuse me, liberal democracy is a contradiction in terms.
[01:40:00.552 --> 01:40:03.013]  Liberalism has never been democratic.
[01:40:03.494 --> 01:40:08.716]  So even the name of those, you know, systems in the West is wrong.
[01:40:09.276 --> 01:40:11.018]  It is not liberal democracy.
[01:40:11.358 --> 01:40:22.647]  It is liberal autocracy that has taken grip over Europe and is trying to control America, but suddenly Trump came out of nowhere, and they're terrified.
[01:40:22.927 --> 01:40:23.487]  They're running.
[01:40:23.547 --> 01:40:24.628]  They don't know what to do.
[01:40:24.949 --> 01:40:26.129]  They're making mistakes.
[01:40:26.530 --> 01:40:31.534]  They're actually clashing with each other, and that is why there is a chance still, but
[01:40:31.974 --> 01:40:32.974]  We have to unite.
[01:40:33.414 --> 01:40:38.656]  Conservatives of the world, I'm using Marx's lingo, but we have to unite.
[01:40:38.696 --> 01:40:54.761]  No, we have to counter their internationalism as Christians and conservatives of every race, color, and creed, unified around free speech, around religious freedom, around free market, and around the international true brotherhood of humankind, and sisterhood, to counter their total tyranny.
[01:40:54.781 --> 01:40:55.381]  Because as you know,
[01:40:56.321 --> 01:40:59.224]  The proto-globalist helped set up the bullshit revolution.
[01:40:59.745 --> 01:41:02.307]  The liberal elements of the CIA helped put Mao into power.
[01:41:02.348 --> 01:41:03.449]  It's now all declassified.
[01:41:03.469 --> 01:41:05.671]  It all came out McCarthy was right.
[01:41:06.051 --> 01:41:13.759]  And so, from my research, not that czarism was good, it was all crumbling, I know about all that, and the white Russians' corruption, and the czarists, and all of it, but you have...
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:20.284]  That being replaced with, like, this liberal playland of total social engineering and control.
[01:41:20.304 --> 01:41:24.627]  And so now they're just mad that their fantasy's falling apart in Russia.
[01:41:25.007 --> 01:41:26.528]  Now their fantasy's falling apart here.
[01:41:26.548 --> 01:41:27.649]  I think you're right.
[01:41:27.689 --> 01:41:32.512]  We have that shared enemy that is the deranged, militant, anti-God.
[01:41:32.552 --> 01:41:33.913]  I mean, look at Russia under their control.
[01:41:34.153 --> 01:41:41.378]  Couldn't be Christian, attacked families, tried to push promiscuity, tried to break the society down, but they couldn't get Russians to accept
[01:41:42.078 --> 01:41:44.159]  As much of it culturally as they've got us to do.
[01:41:44.479 --> 01:41:47.620]  And they've almost got us right to the tipping point, right where they wanted us.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.480]  And like you said, here comes Trump.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:42:00.763]  But one thing I want to point out, Alex, which is I think very important, when you mentioned the free market, unfortunately the free market has been disappearing.
[01:42:01.103 --> 01:42:03.144]  We now have a virtual economy.
[01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:07.385]  The rule of the financial markets, they're going against us.
[01:42:07.805 --> 01:42:09.347]  They're going against the coordinates.
[01:42:30.913 --> 01:42:31.293]  Thank you.
[01:42:31.733 --> 01:42:37.836]  I'm getting accused of being run by Russians so I thought I'd get a former Kremlin official on so we can actually start talking to them since they're my boss.
[01:42:37.896 --> 01:42:38.497]  I didn't know that.
[01:42:39.457 --> 01:42:43.059]  But Roger Stone, we got him coming on.
[01:42:43.939 --> 01:42:45.240]  They say he works for the Russians too.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.202]  He gave us the latest on Mueller and so much more.
[01:42:48.582 --> 01:42:54.345]  And then we have the man facing six months in prison for saying he didn't like Hitler but then doing a Hitler dog joke.
[01:42:54.425 --> 01:42:54.825]  That's right.
[01:42:57.179 --> 01:43:03.324]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in Fort Worth's life, it'd take hours.
[01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.626]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:43:06.066 --> 01:43:06.647]  It's stronger.
[01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:08.829]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:43:08.869 --> 01:43:11.751]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:43:12.091 --> 01:43:12.832]  It's back in stock.
[01:43:13.192 --> 01:43:14.833]  The Real Red Pill.
[01:43:15.053 --> 01:43:16.034]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:43:16.374 --> 01:43:19.736]  It's got the preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.

[01:44:56.212 --> 01:45:07.755]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[01:45:07.795 --> 01:45:08.755]  We're exposed to lead.
[01:45:08.775 --> 01:45:09.815]  We're exposed to mercury.
[01:45:09.835 --> 01:45:14.836]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[01:45:15.216 --> 01:45:20.237]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[01:45:20.317 --> 01:45:22.458]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[01:45:23.258 --> 01:45:24.639]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[01:45:24.759 --> 01:45:28.381]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[01:45:28.501 --> 01:45:33.484]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[01:45:33.844 --> 01:45:39.308]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[01:45:39.688 --> 01:45:44.911]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[01:45:45.271 --> 01:45:46.211]  And over and over again.
[01:45:46.291 --> 01:45:53.173]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[01:45:53.393 --> 01:45:55.593]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[01:45:55.713 --> 01:45:57.233]  I mean, this is so massive.
[01:45:57.333 --> 01:46:10.616]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland in men.
[01:46:10.656 --> 01:46:11.276]  Fertility is key.
[01:46:11.856 --> 01:46:28.444]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[01:46:28.804 --> 01:46:32.826]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:36.408]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[01:46:36.908 --> 01:46:38.289]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[01:46:38.789 --> 01:46:40.190]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:21.878 --> 01:47:24.860]  Alright, Roger Stone is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.780]  Former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:47:28.301 --> 01:47:31.463]  That's right, we are crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:47:31.823 --> 01:47:39.507]  Yeah, you know guys, when you hear me and I come in and I start talking over the liner, just slap that sucker down.
[01:47:40.047 --> 01:47:41.708]  Just cut that mother off.
[01:47:42.128 --> 01:47:47.611]  You hear me start talking, you know a liner's coming, just... That's the standard setting, just blammo.
[01:47:48.419 --> 01:47:50.461]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:47:50.521 --> 01:47:55.125]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:47:55.846 --> 01:48:01.411]  And we are under massive globalist attack because we are over the target.
[01:48:01.471 --> 01:48:02.852]  We are in the fight.
[01:48:02.912 --> 01:48:04.433]  We are in the thick of it.
[01:48:04.473 --> 01:48:08.637]  We are at the heart of the epicenter of the battle for the future.
[01:48:09.598 --> 01:48:10.559]  And Roger Stone,
[01:48:12.438 --> 01:48:20.643]  I wanted to get him on because he has predicted this all very, very accurately, that the Trump lawyers were told, oh, it'll be over by November.
[01:48:20.663 --> 01:48:21.563]  It'll be over by December.
[01:48:21.603 --> 01:48:22.764]  We know you're not implicated.
[01:48:23.024 --> 01:48:24.685]  We know there's no evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:48:25.186 --> 01:48:28.608]  They're not going to go out into other things or other companies or other groups, just the Russians.
[01:48:29.008 --> 01:48:37.673]  And then now Trump has been told, no, it's going to go on forever, and it deals with you personally, and it deals with European companies and U.S.
[01:48:37.713 --> 01:48:40.515]  companies and your employees, and it's never going to end.
[01:48:41.855 --> 01:48:46.717]  And Trump knows that Mueller was involved, covering up for Hillary, covering up for all the crimes.
[01:48:47.037 --> 01:48:49.158]  Comey's been caught leaking, lying to Congress.
[01:48:49.398 --> 01:48:50.278]  McCabe's been caught.
[01:48:51.039 --> 01:49:02.843]  And now he's sitting there looking at this and CNN, I have the headline right here, says that the fate of Trump is in the hands of Mueller and that Mueller has him cornered.
[01:49:04.583 --> 01:49:06.224]  And when you know about the three branches of government,
[01:49:07.148 --> 01:49:18.547]  And you know about, this is under the executive, this is a rogue group that's been caught being political, and being caught making up intelligence, and being caught illegally spying, that the whole thing has to get shut down and Mueller has to get indicted.
[01:49:18.667 --> 01:49:19.568]  That's the default.
[01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:21.471]  But instead,
[01:49:22.796 --> 01:49:27.137]  The media pushes this like Mueller is God, the fourth branch of government.
[01:49:27.157 --> 01:49:28.217]  Well, who oversees him?
[01:49:28.957 --> 01:49:31.258]  You see, the President's fate is not in the hands of Mueller.
[01:49:31.578 --> 01:49:32.618]  It's in the hands of the American people.
[01:49:32.898 --> 01:49:34.159]  He has to be impeached.
[01:49:35.099 --> 01:49:37.179]  That's why the Democrats want to get control of the House.
[01:49:37.839 --> 01:49:39.420]  We have to buy into their bull.
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:44.741]  So they're selling the idea that if Mueller indicts him for some process thing, not Russian-related,
[01:49:45.521 --> 01:49:46.442]  That he has to go.
[01:49:46.542 --> 01:49:47.982]  That's the big hoax now.
[01:49:48.283 --> 01:49:50.804]  We know Russiagate's a hoax, but Mueller is a hoax.
[01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:53.305]  So they're now pushing that, ooh, he's got him.
[01:49:53.325 --> 01:49:55.086]  It's like Darth Vader with Luke Skywalker.
[01:49:55.346 --> 01:49:56.027]  I have you now.
[01:49:56.367 --> 01:49:57.888]  So where are we really, Roger?
[01:49:57.908 --> 01:49:58.988]  Because you've laid all this out.
[01:49:59.349 --> 01:50:00.249]  You've warned the President.
[01:50:00.289 --> 01:50:03.671]  You said early on when the President was really strong, he's even probably stronger now,
[01:50:04.011 --> 01:50:04.672]  Just get rid of Mueller.
[01:50:04.712 --> 01:50:05.312]  He's a fraud.
[01:50:05.713 --> 01:50:07.134]  Start indicting McCabe and all of them.
[01:50:07.335 --> 01:50:09.357]  The word is those indictments are being looked at.
[01:50:09.397 --> 01:50:10.097]  It's open and shut.
[01:50:10.618 --> 01:50:11.519]  So what's the answer?
[01:50:11.579 --> 01:50:12.440]  Super offensive?
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.562]  Indict all these people that are open and shut?
[01:50:15.003 --> 01:50:15.903]  Go after Hillary?
[01:50:16.404 --> 01:50:18.006]  And then Mueller just falls away?
[01:50:18.786 --> 01:50:22.891]  Or just let Mueller go on forever just looking for a crooked toenail somewhere, Roger?
[01:50:24.164 --> 01:50:35.520]  Well, Alex, first of all, I think the president's decision to add Joe DiGenova to his legal team shows a new combativeness and maybe a new awareness on the part of the president.
[01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:42.065]  Joe DeGeneva is not some weak-kneed, Ivy League, white-shoe lawyer.
[01:50:42.586 --> 01:50:44.146]  He's a street brawler.
[01:50:44.647 --> 01:50:50.729]  And he understands that this isn't really a legal proceeding so much as a political proceeding.
[01:50:51.269 --> 01:50:59.393]  Now, as you know, the special counsel law under which Mueller would normally be operating has expired.
[01:51:00.046 --> 01:51:07.369]  Therefore, Mr. Mueller has no checks or restraints on what he can do and where he can go.
[01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:19.915]  Under the previous special counsel law, he would have had to go on to a three-judge panel for any expansion of his inquiry into an area broader than Russian collusion.
[01:51:19.935 --> 01:51:22.797]  So he is Lord High Protector at this point?
[01:51:22.817 --> 01:51:25.278]  He is just his own branch of government running around?
[01:51:26.525 --> 01:51:43.972]  Well, interestingly enough, and I think this is a very key point, even though there's no statutory requirement for him to do so, he has gone to Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, and had him approve every single step of his path towards removing the President.
[01:51:44.432 --> 01:51:48.116]  The expansion, the Manafort indictments, the Flynn indictment.
[01:51:48.957 --> 01:51:58.869]  Mr. Rosenstein approved all of this, attempting to give Mueller the mantle of some kind of Justice Department cover in his efforts.
[01:51:59.429 --> 01:52:15.560]  That and that alone, or that added to the fact that Rosenstein also approved the use of the phony dossier to put the Trump campaign under surveillance, in my opinion, is grounds for the dismissal of Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:16.221]  Absolutely!
[01:52:16.281 --> 01:52:18.182]  Isn't he just another ringleader like McCabe?
[01:52:19.181 --> 01:52:22.484]  Well, actually, I think in an odd way, he's the keystone.
[01:52:22.785 --> 01:52:27.269]  I think if you pull Rosenstein out, it all collapses now.
[01:52:27.289 --> 01:52:29.111]  He's the one that launched the whole witch hunt.
[01:52:30.192 --> 01:52:30.973]  Exactly right.
[01:52:31.393 --> 01:52:42.445]  And therefore, I think in the event that you terminated Mueller, the decision to fire him, the order to fire him, would go to Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:52:43.312 --> 01:52:44.593]  Would he carry out that order?
[01:52:44.613 --> 01:52:46.133]  So that's a feedback loop.
[01:52:46.173 --> 01:52:47.814]  So it should fall to the Inspector General.
[01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.775]  It should fall to the President.
[01:52:50.155 --> 01:52:51.535]  It's actually worse than that.
[01:52:51.955 --> 01:52:56.097]  Rosenstein and Mueller did something very clever.
[01:52:57.150 --> 01:52:58.451]  Or at least Rosenstein did.
[01:52:58.611 --> 01:53:15.816]  Early in the Trump administration, they got the president to sign a change that changes the order of authority at the Justice Department from the Attorney General, Sessions, to Rosenstein, to the woman who retired recently, who was the number three person in the department.
[01:53:16.276 --> 01:53:18.177]  And then it doesn't go to the Solicitor General.
[01:53:18.197 --> 01:53:19.117]  It goes to the U.S.
[01:53:19.177 --> 01:53:21.198]  Attorney in Texas, and then a U.S.
[01:53:21.258 --> 01:53:24.399]  Attorney in North Carolina, both Bush loyalists.
[01:53:24.899 --> 01:53:30.422]  So, they're trying to rig the House just in case Donald Trump fires Mr. Mueller.
[01:53:30.582 --> 01:53:32.724]  I would not urge him to fire Mueller at this point.
[01:53:33.364 --> 01:53:40.048]  I would demand that a special prosecutor be appointed or the Justice Department can do this.
[01:53:44.574 --> 01:53:55.152]  Look at Mueller's involvement in Uranium One, and specifically the trip that he took to Russia in 2009, carrying uranium samples for Hillary and Bill Clinton.
[01:53:56.508 --> 01:53:57.048]  Exactly!
[01:53:57.909 --> 01:54:04.091]  Imagine if we had Trump on a tarmac with secret rendezvous with Uranium, or Loretta Lynch in secret meetings with Bill Clinton.
[01:54:04.111 --> 01:54:05.372]  We have these crooks.
[01:54:05.992 --> 01:54:07.153]  That's why they're so desperate.
[01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:08.393]  They're never going to give up.
[01:54:08.853 --> 01:54:10.614]  And notice CNN and others always change the subject.
[01:54:10.634 --> 01:54:14.856]  Every time he goes, this is corrupt, this person's corrupt, and Trump's right, they change the subject.
[01:54:14.916 --> 01:54:16.337]  Don't fire Mueller, you'll get in trouble.
[01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:20.332]  Instead, we leave him out there flapping, flapping in the wind.
[01:54:20.352 --> 01:54:27.395]  But at a certain point, Trump has a responsibility, and Attorney General Sessions does, to start firing all these people for the open crimes they've committed.
[01:54:27.615 --> 01:54:31.057]  I mean, I get it makes it look bad, but it's still what you need to do.
[01:54:31.177 --> 01:54:37.860]  I mean, you know, if Mueller's running around setting fires to people's houses at night, he's still got to arrest him.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:39.261]  I mean, it doesn't matter how it looks.
[01:54:40.562 --> 01:54:42.142]  I could not agree more.
[01:54:42.162 --> 01:54:47.964]  The problem, of course, is the President's made his desires perfectly clear, including through his Twitter feed.
[01:54:48.504 --> 01:54:50.745]  But Jeff Sessions isn't getting the message.
[01:54:51.665 --> 01:55:04.108]  The video footage of Sessions dining with Rosenstein in downtown Washington toasting each other was open contempt of the President of the United States.
[01:55:04.728 --> 01:55:07.853]  So what is the best thinking on Sessions?
[01:55:08.254 --> 01:55:10.417]  What in the world is going on with this guy?
[01:55:11.358 --> 01:55:12.139]  It's very simple.
[01:55:12.259 --> 01:55:19.871]  The president's chief advisors have convinced the president that he cannot get away with firing Sessions if he would face impeachment.
[01:55:20.578 --> 01:55:21.459]  I don't think so.
[01:55:21.919 --> 01:55:27.063]  The President's leverage gets stronger and stronger as the economy rebounds.
[01:55:27.563 --> 01:55:41.334]  If he emerges from the Korean peace talks with any kind of accomplishment, say the denuclearization of North Korea, he will have enormous leverage to put this thing away once and for all.
[01:55:41.394 --> 01:55:51.161]  No, I agree, but I mean, why would Sessions be toasting with Rosenstein and then having public events where he says he's the best ever, when Rosenstein is a clear little Clinton creature?
[01:55:52.482 --> 01:56:01.808]  A congressman who's a friend of mine had an extensive meeting with Jeff Sessions and he came away saying, the man is doddering.
[01:56:02.518 --> 01:56:04.600]  That he is, that he's around the bend.
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.823]  That he is no longer well enough to have a clear thought.
[01:56:08.983 --> 01:56:11.025]  Oh, so he's had a mini-stroke or something?
[01:56:11.625 --> 01:56:12.065]  Something.
[01:56:12.185 --> 01:56:14.107]  All he does is rage about marijuana.
[01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:16.208]  Arresting all those people on marijuana.
[01:56:16.248 --> 01:56:18.150]  Which is one of the worst things ever for Trump.
[01:56:18.710 --> 01:56:20.131]  Because it just turns everybody off.
[01:56:21.492 --> 01:56:21.993]  Absolutely.
[01:56:22.033 --> 01:56:25.656]  I mean, Sessions, Sessions is, his expiration date is over.
[01:56:25.996 --> 01:56:27.277]  He needs to be put out to pasture.
[01:56:28.095 --> 01:56:41.331]  In a poll by Trump's pollster, which we broke on The War Room, some 69% of Trump supporters, 68% of Republicans, are for state legalized medicinal marijuana.
[01:56:41.831 --> 01:56:47.618]  And the number of people who believe the states should decide, despite their own personal views, is in the 80s.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:57.175]  This is a silent third rail that would just shear off libertarian and conservative oriented pro-Trump voters.
[01:56:57.195 --> 01:56:57.776]  All right, stay there.
[01:56:57.816 --> 01:56:59.679]  I want to come back and briefly ask you, Roger.
[01:57:01.212 --> 01:57:04.873]  What their next moves are going to be, because you've been accurately breaking all that down.
[01:57:04.893 --> 01:57:06.513]  I'll do five more minutes with you.
[01:57:06.553 --> 01:57:09.034]  How the globals are going to try to derail the economy.
[01:57:09.594 --> 01:57:11.574]  There's this Russia summit now being announced.
[01:57:11.914 --> 01:57:16.075]  I guess they'll meet in Reykjavik or something, a la Reagan and Gorbachev.
[01:57:16.455 --> 01:57:17.496]  And any other big tidbits.
[01:57:17.516 --> 01:57:18.496]  I know we're going to talk warfare today.
[01:57:18.516 --> 01:57:22.097]  We've got some other big stuff that's going to be breaking in the next few days.
[01:57:22.677 --> 01:57:23.597]  Roger Stone joins us.
[01:57:24.893 --> 01:57:26.395]  I'm Alex Jones in the ATX.
[01:57:26.795 --> 01:57:28.758]  A fifth bomb went off this morning at a FedEx Center.
[01:57:29.158 --> 01:57:30.840]  They've given people exclusive details on that.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:32.182]  These are mousetrap bombs.
[01:57:32.782 --> 01:57:33.503]  I'll explain that.
[01:57:33.724 --> 01:57:34.484]  It's all coming up.
[01:57:34.825 --> 01:57:36.727]  Third and fourth hours straight ahead.
[01:57:36.927 --> 01:57:37.668]  So much more.
[01:57:37.968 --> 01:57:39.811]  Tomorrow's news today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:47.289 --> 01:57:50.812]  Tell us about Spikes Tactical and why it's so important.
[01:57:50.832 --> 01:57:51.113]  5% off.
[01:57:51.133 --> 01:57:52.674]  It's already discounted, folks.
[01:57:53.335 --> 01:57:56.898]  When you go there, use promo code Alex at SpikesTactical.com.
[01:57:57.158 --> 01:57:58.159]  Tell us about that kit.
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:05.687]  Spike himself just sought to make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford.
[01:58:06.587 --> 01:58:11.310]  And that's why Pipe Hitters Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well.
[01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:13.371]  We wanted to put out a line of rifles.
[01:58:13.871 --> 01:58:21.675]  We wanted rifles that were high quality, that were combat rated, that we could like put our name on and really stand behind.
[01:58:21.795 --> 01:58:27.298]  So we looked around at quite a few companies and to be quite honest it was an easy decision to make.
[01:58:27.658 --> 01:58:29.999]  Spikes Tactical is a small family-owned
[01:58:30.699 --> 01:58:31.099]  Business.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.760]  They stand behind their products.
[01:58:32.981 --> 01:58:35.562]  As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee.
[01:58:35.602 --> 01:58:39.044]  If you have a problem with your gun, they will fix the problem.
[01:58:39.104 --> 01:58:41.385]  And that is huge in today's age.
[01:58:41.685 --> 01:58:45.608]  So you've got a very high-end rifle at a very affordable price.
[01:58:46.128 --> 01:58:47.469]  We're also 100% American made.
[01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:52.351]  They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[01:58:52.491 --> 01:58:54.772]  They are strong supporters of the military.
[01:58:54.872 --> 01:58:56.073]  Spike gives back a lot.
[01:58:56.113 --> 01:59:00.255]  Well, I know the listeners are big fans already of Spike Tactical and the fact you're supporting us.

[01:59:50.392 --> 01:59:54.274]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:11.328]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:12.029 --> 02:00:13.570]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.011 --> 02:00:18.853]  I wanted to ask Roger Stone this question.
[02:00:21.094 --> 02:00:24.236]  Just historically, imagine we're looking back 20 years from now.
[02:00:24.876 --> 02:00:26.137]  What is this period in history?
[02:00:26.377 --> 02:00:29.979]  The rebirth of nationalism, the rebirth of free market, the rebirth of populism?
[02:00:32.014 --> 02:00:33.055]  And how can you turn away?
[02:00:33.135 --> 02:00:34.296]  It's so entertaining.
[02:00:34.376 --> 02:00:35.397]  It's so exciting.
[02:00:35.998 --> 02:00:37.179]  And then you realize it's real.
[02:00:37.359 --> 02:00:38.079]  Real globalists.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:38.900]  Real socialists.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:39.901]  Real authoritarians.
[02:00:40.261 --> 02:00:41.342]  Shutting down free speech.
[02:00:42.083 --> 02:00:43.524]  Top globalists suing us.
[02:00:44.025 --> 02:00:45.946]  Stuff we haven't even announced yet happening to Roger.
[02:00:46.547 --> 02:00:52.712]  I mean... It's like we're the Americans fighting the globalists and we're targeted.
[02:00:52.732 --> 02:00:54.594]  Trump, Stone, myself, a few others.
[02:00:54.954 --> 02:00:57.637]  You, the audience, backing us and they're so pissed you're there backing us.
[02:00:58.502 --> 02:01:02.045]  And they're doing everything they can to turn down our reach and everything else, but it's not working because of you.
[02:01:02.085 --> 02:01:04.907]  So, thank God you're out there, folks, and you realize the fight we're in.
[02:01:04.947 --> 02:01:07.409]  Roger, how would you describe the time we're in right now?
[02:01:07.469 --> 02:01:13.793]  And I know you're going to be joining us tomorrow with a bunch of big, breaking, exclusive news, but I just hope people realize this is history happening.
[02:01:13.834 --> 02:01:14.794]  This isn't Netflix.
[02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:15.795]  This isn't HBO.
[02:01:16.115 --> 02:01:16.956]  This isn't fiction.
[02:01:16.996 --> 02:01:17.596]  This is real.
[02:01:18.877 --> 02:01:24.982]  You know, Alex, I was speaking to Dr. Jerry Corsi about this this morning, and he really summed it up in a very brief phrase.
[02:01:26.199 --> 02:01:29.581]  America was saved in the 2016 election.
[02:01:29.841 --> 02:01:38.004]  Out of nowhere, most improbably, an outsider comes who's not beholden to the globalists and the two-party neocons that have destroyed the country.
[02:01:38.865 --> 02:01:41.786]  And now we are in the midst of a coup d'etat.
[02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:48.192]  They intend to illegally, unconstitutionally undo the results of the last election.
[02:01:48.633 --> 02:02:09.401]  And they will resort to every trick in the book, whether it is lawfare to silence the supporters of Donald Trump and reform, or whether it is phone and these phony lawsuits that are designed to bankrupt us, whether it is the manipulation of social media to limit our ability to reach other patriots and tell them what's going on,
[02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:22.509]  Or whether it is a corrupted legal process in which a special prosecutor who has no constraints on him, not constrained by the Congress, by the Justice Department.
[02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:32.776]  I mean, Andrew McCarthy wrote an excellent piece on this in the National Review this week, where I think there are fundamental questions not to putting aside the conflict.
[02:02:32.816 --> 02:02:35.658]  This is rogue government constitutional crisis stuff.
[02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:41.415]  There's no question that there's a planned coup d'etat, and it's in the works.
[02:02:41.515 --> 02:02:49.504]  But a key element to the success of the coup d'etat is to silence Alex Jones, to silence Roger Stone, to silence
[02:02:50.787 --> 02:02:53.629]  Because they're going to shut everybody else down when they're done.
[02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:54.430]  They've announced it.
[02:02:54.490 --> 02:02:55.991]  That's why we've got to raise the alarm.
[02:02:56.391 --> 02:02:57.672]  And we're so close to the problem.
[02:02:57.713 --> 02:03:00.915]  We don't tend to get how sensational this is for everybody's future.
[02:03:01.396 --> 02:03:02.537]  They mean business.
[02:03:02.597 --> 02:03:03.958]  They know the genie's out of the bottle.
[02:03:04.338 --> 02:03:06.460]  The only thing they've got is total authoritarianism.
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:07.921]  And good luck.
[02:03:08.061 --> 02:03:09.763]  I don't think the dog's going to hunt, Roger.
[02:03:10.899 --> 02:03:19.561]  Well, the irony of this is those pundits who say Mueller's got, you know, Trump cornered now, they misunderstand how much power the president has.
[02:03:20.022 --> 02:03:27.864]  In fact, in all truth, Alex, sometimes I wonder whether the president understands fully how much power he has to change the course of events.
[02:03:27.884 --> 02:03:28.864]  That's right, and this is critical.
[02:03:29.184 --> 02:03:32.567]  He's letting the mainstream media do one thing that they're having some success.
[02:03:33.067 --> 02:03:38.732]  Create a false narrative about the separation of powers, unitary executive, co-equal, all the Supreme Court rulings.
[02:03:39.072 --> 02:03:43.756]  Like when he says you can't bring in people with fake passports from terror nations, they go, he can't do that.
[02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:48.840]  When the federal law is 100%, the Constitution, Supreme Court 9-0, kill those courts.
[02:03:49.181 --> 02:03:50.602]  The media says he's overriding the courts.
[02:03:50.702 --> 02:03:52.864]  No, the court, the real court, certified it.
[02:03:53.544 --> 02:03:54.125]  It's the same thing.
[02:03:54.485 --> 02:03:59.208]  They keep acting like if he chooses what's on the menu at the White House, he's a dictator.
[02:03:59.588 --> 02:04:02.450]  And that somehow it's bad if he controls the executive and cleans house.
[02:04:02.971 --> 02:04:08.274]  If anything, he's in dereliction of duty letting this Clinton cabal run wild at the Justice Department.
[02:04:08.475 --> 02:04:09.715]  He needs to move on their ass.
[02:04:09.996 --> 02:04:13.058]  And I mean, like they're calling for extra judicial?
[02:04:13.258 --> 02:04:13.898]  That's illegal.
[02:04:14.279 --> 02:04:17.401]  Once they call, the president can do that with covert action.
[02:04:17.561 --> 02:04:18.742]  And that's the best thing for the country.
[02:04:19.898 --> 02:04:31.587]  Well, you know, it's amazing to see the mainstream media try to put the best possible face on their efforts to re-inflate the Russian collusion fraud.
[02:04:32.467 --> 02:04:47.038]  They're really at this point, I think, just swatting at flies, but never underestimate the deep enmity of the political insiders in Washington for this president or their resolve to remove him one way or another.
[02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:51.322]  Roger, since you bring this up, do five more minutes with us.
[02:04:51.362 --> 02:04:53.003]  I want to come back in 60 seconds and get into this.
[02:04:53.023 --> 02:04:56.784]  When I talk about covert action, everybody knows I don't shoot my mouth off.
[02:04:58.305 --> 02:05:04.468]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in InfoWars life, it'd take hours.
[02:05:04.768 --> 02:05:06.769]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:05:07.209 --> 02:05:07.789]  It's stronger.
[02:05:08.389 --> 02:05:09.970]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:12.871]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:05:13.232 --> 02:05:13.972]  It's back in stock.
[02:05:14.332 --> 02:05:15.973]  The Real Red Pill.
[02:05:16.193 --> 02:05:17.174]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:05:17.514 --> 02:05:20.877]  It's got the preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:05:21.277 --> 02:05:24.019]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[02:05:24.399 --> 02:05:25.120]  So you can upload it.
[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:34.407]  Our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[02:05:34.447 --> 02:05:35.307]  That's a spray you do.
[02:05:35.347 --> 02:05:36.288]  You can also swallow it.
[02:05:36.688 --> 02:05:38.550]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:41.993]  Super high quality silver and a lot more.
[02:05:42.013 --> 02:05:43.374]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:05:43.414 --> 02:05:53.003]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWorksStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:05:53.343 --> 02:05:56.406]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:05:59.348 --> 02:06:00.770]  Big Brother.
[02:06:06.738 --> 02:06:07.980]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:09.522 --> 02:06:10.623]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:12.125 --> 02:06:13.046]  You want answers?
[02:06:13.747 --> 02:06:15.709]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:15.949 --> 02:06:22.257]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.239 --> 02:06:26.242]  Ladies and gentlemen, in fact, queue it up.
[02:06:28.098 --> 02:06:34.343]  A congressman, we'll put the article on screen, called for the second amendment to be used against the president this weekend.
[02:06:34.924 --> 02:06:37.426]  Another congressman went on and said, let's just take him out.
[02:06:37.886 --> 02:06:39.328]  Phil Mudd said, we're going to kill him.
[02:06:40.048 --> 02:06:43.791]  Schumer said, we got seven ways this Sunday to make you pay in the intelligence agencies.
[02:06:45.293 --> 02:06:52.018]  The New York Times advertises, here's where they play baseball in the conservative libertarian caucus, in the Freedom Caucus.
[02:06:52.059 --> 02:06:53.360]  Boy, somebody could attack there.
[02:06:54.838 --> 02:06:59.300]  They're all over the news saying, kill everybody, kill me, kill Roger Stone, kill, kill, kill.
[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:01.441]  They've whipped the country up into this.
[02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:02.802]  That's illegal.
[02:07:04.002 --> 02:07:09.605]  And the president's sitting there trying to turn the economy back on, proving we were artificially restrained, which I told you.
[02:07:10.465 --> 02:07:10.965]  It's a fact.
[02:07:11.345 --> 02:07:12.206]  That's what globalism is.
[02:07:12.246 --> 02:07:14.387]  They write white papers how they got their foot on our neck.
[02:07:15.054 --> 02:07:27.759]  And then they're everywhere saying kill the president, they're everywhere saying they're going to overthrow the election, they're stealing elections in Pennsylvania, and they're stealing elections and it doesn't matter whether they had a better candidate, it doesn't matter if they had a better candidate, you know, than Roy Moore or whatever, they stole those.
[02:07:27.779 --> 02:07:29.000]  There was total evidence in both.
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:43.206]  And the Republicans just roll over to it, and they're running around saying they're going to end the First Amendment once they take over, and they've got Obama's law firm suing him, two of Hillary's law firms suing me, and these people mean business.
[02:07:43.226 --> 02:07:43.826]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:07:45.694 --> 02:07:55.488]  When people start saying, we're gonna go kill the president, or let's use the second amendment on him, we'll get that clip up in that article up in a minute, we're gonna play it.
[02:07:57.352 --> 02:08:08.245]  When that type of stuff's going on, if somebody comes up to you and says, I've got a gun pointed at you, and it's really just their finger and their pants, you got a right to blow them away.
[02:08:08.886 --> 02:08:15.514]  But if somebody's a congressman or former head of CIA assassination operations like Mudd, he didn't ever kill anybody himself, but he was over it.
[02:08:16.305 --> 02:08:17.286]  Because the globalists are cowards.
[02:08:17.306 --> 02:08:18.106]  They put little weasels.
[02:08:18.126 --> 02:08:20.007]  There's always a super wimp over the real killers.
[02:08:20.708 --> 02:08:27.952]  And they're always real scared of the super killers and keep them down and, you know, set them up for special regimens of vaccines to brain damage them after they've done the killing.
[02:08:27.972 --> 02:08:30.074]  But I'm educating all the killers.
[02:08:30.094 --> 02:08:30.474]  Don't worry.
[02:08:31.014 --> 02:08:31.875]  So, that's right.
[02:08:32.135 --> 02:08:34.456]  So what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, the killers are with us.
[02:08:34.657 --> 02:08:35.897]  The Americans are with us, by the way.
[02:08:36.258 --> 02:08:39.480]  And so what all these chicken necks need to understand is this.
[02:08:40.598 --> 02:08:44.944]  We know what you're doing with all your violence and all your talk of violence and all your organizing for it.
[02:08:45.165 --> 02:08:48.069]  So you keep reaping what you sow.
[02:08:48.570 --> 02:08:50.853]  You sow war, you're gonna get big time war.
[02:08:51.574 --> 02:08:52.856]  And you're gonna get the whirlwind.
[02:08:52.936 --> 02:08:55.139]  So, I'm not planning any violence myself.
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:56.060]  Okay?
[02:08:57.139 --> 02:08:58.139]  I'm in the information war.
[02:08:58.159 --> 02:08:59.920]  We're having a big effect, but I'm not scared of your threats.
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:10.504]  And the President and the people around him and the folks that understand the Constitution and where we are, we're dealing with globalist operatives, outside powers, enemy combatants trying to overthrow our reboot.
[02:09:10.724 --> 02:09:12.464]  They're all in the payroll of Communist Chinese.
[02:09:12.484 --> 02:09:13.425]  They're our only funding group.
[02:09:13.725 --> 02:09:15.305]  Trump's cut off Saudi Arabia.
[02:09:15.685 --> 02:09:16.906]  He's cutting off Soros.
[02:09:17.806 --> 02:09:21.167]  And so I know the President knows what he's doing, but he's kicking the moles out.
[02:09:21.307 --> 02:09:22.908]  Big positive news to get the moles out.
[02:09:24.542 --> 02:09:27.143]  All I'm saying is, you look at all this and the big push.
[02:09:27.484 --> 02:09:34.467]  We're dealing with outside authoritarian powers, organizing violence, carrying out violence, and now trying to get their constituents to be violent.
[02:09:35.008 --> 02:09:43.332]  And we have a right and a duty and a responsibility to start public discussions of what we're going to do about it, if this escalates even a notch more.
[02:09:43.752 --> 02:09:45.794]  And you can't do it once they go into full attack mode.
[02:09:45.994 --> 02:09:48.515]  You've got to have pre-planned triggers laid.
[02:09:49.015 --> 02:09:49.616]  Dead switches.
[02:09:50.296 --> 02:09:51.077]  Deadman switches.
[02:09:51.777 --> 02:09:56.240]  And so, it's time, I'm raising the alarm, it's time to have serious discussions.
[02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:02.765]  Because we don't expect to deal with something like this, especially a bunch of leftists who are cowards and weaklings and don't even have a good command and control.
[02:10:03.125 --> 02:10:04.306]  But it's still dangerous.
[02:10:05.126 --> 02:10:09.489]  And so they're trying to politically isolate, bankrupt us, demonize us, ahead of killing us.
[02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:11.111]  And so, here's the deal.
[02:10:12.692 --> 02:10:14.253]  Whatever happens to me, that's going to be alright.
[02:10:14.533 --> 02:10:16.314]  Just so long as they in the end get it.
[02:10:16.334 --> 02:10:16.955]  Now, Roger Stone.
[02:10:17.930 --> 02:10:20.453]  I want to go to Roger Stone and in the next five minutes we'll go to our next guest.
[02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:23.116]  When I talk about covert action, not us.
[02:10:23.656 --> 02:10:25.498]  But we have a clear and present danger.
[02:10:25.538 --> 02:10:26.619]  We have an outside power.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.341]  We have the globalists pushing all this.
[02:10:29.262 --> 02:10:30.063]  What should we do?
[02:10:30.383 --> 02:10:31.725]  What should the president be doing right now?
[02:10:33.243 --> 02:10:54.519]  Well, the single most important thing I think he can do to set the table, Alex, would be to order his assistant attorney general for antitrust to bust up the tech left attempts to strangle InfoWars and Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich and Milo and Steven Crowder and so on.
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:57.241]  I mean, I just want to say this again.
[02:10:57.261 --> 02:11:02.926]  A precursor to their entire insidious coup d'etat plan.
[02:11:03.664 --> 02:11:05.946]  It has two precursor steps.
[02:11:06.587 --> 02:11:09.469]  One, silence the advocates of freedom.
[02:11:09.769 --> 02:11:11.611]  Silence those who would defend Trump.
[02:11:11.971 --> 02:11:14.954]  Number two, take away our guns.
[02:11:15.614 --> 02:11:16.695]  That's the plan.
[02:11:17.075 --> 02:11:20.638]  That way the removal of Donald Trump can go peacefully.
[02:11:21.559 --> 02:11:30.547]  So the most important thing he can do is wake up to the fact that whether or not Jared Kushner has a pleasant dinner with the Google executives is immaterial.
[02:11:31.167 --> 02:11:43.560]  The President's supporters are being censored, are having their heads chopped off every single day on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google, on YouTube.
[02:11:43.981 --> 02:11:46.083]  And this really must stop.
[02:11:47.179 --> 02:11:47.519]  That's right.
[02:11:47.539 --> 02:11:51.121]  Let's put the article on screen from Infowars.com from Sunday if people want to see it.
[02:11:51.521 --> 02:11:54.183]  Dem Congressman uses Second Amendment to resist Trump.
[02:11:54.783 --> 02:11:57.024]  And he's sitting there talking to a town hall of your radio listener.
[02:11:57.224 --> 02:12:00.666]  Tom, S-U-O-Z-Z-I, I guess it's... It's Tom Swasey.
[02:12:00.766 --> 02:12:01.146]  Swasey.
[02:12:01.166 --> 02:12:01.746]  Tom Swasey.
[02:12:01.886 --> 02:12:03.647]  Yeah, makes bizarre statement.
[02:12:04.088 --> 02:12:05.928]  Let's play that clip and then get your take on it.
[02:12:05.969 --> 02:12:06.749]  Roger Stone, here it is.
[02:12:06.769 --> 02:12:12.732]  Matter of putting public pressure on the President.
[02:12:12.984 --> 02:12:16.145]  And making it public, which is hard to break through the news cycle and all the different things.
[02:12:16.885 --> 02:12:19.466]  And it's probably about going to the courts as well.
[02:12:20.587 --> 02:12:29.890]  And then, you know, I mean, this is where the second amendment comes in, quite frankly, because, you know, what if the president was to ignore the courts?
[02:12:31.111 --> 02:12:31.631]  What would you do?
[02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:32.912]  What would we do?
[02:12:34.252 --> 02:12:37.513]  So, what does the second amendment say?
[02:12:37.553 --> 02:12:39.154]  The second amendment is the right to bear arms.
[02:12:45.816 --> 02:12:50.679]  I mean, look at these helpless-looking idiots and this moron trying to organize people.
[02:12:50.699 --> 02:12:51.780]  Hey, we need to use the Second Amendment.
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:53.281]  We need to intimidate the president.
[02:12:53.661 --> 02:12:55.682]  He's not ignoring the courts.
[02:12:55.702 --> 02:12:56.543]  He's winning in the courts.
[02:12:56.843 --> 02:12:58.484]  So they're trying to organize this everywhere.
[02:12:58.504 --> 02:13:00.226]  I've got the other congressman saying, take him out.
[02:13:00.486 --> 02:13:00.966]  Remove him.
[02:13:01.066 --> 02:13:01.687]  I want him gone.
[02:13:01.947 --> 02:13:07.030]  Well, they haven't been able to do that yet, so they're organizing guns against the president.
[02:13:11.099 --> 02:13:13.180]  The way this normally works, even in the U.S.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:16.701]  say 100 years ago, is we were a free, open country.
[02:13:16.721 --> 02:13:22.584]  But if you started organizing, killing the president or killing other people, you know, usually some bad things happen real fast.
[02:13:22.704 --> 02:13:30.188]  Or you went for a canoe and you fell off and a couple people, an airplane blows up, somebody forgets to turn their car off in the garage.
[02:13:30.468 --> 02:13:34.890]  I mean, a lot of these guys, and I don't want that to happen, but here's the deal, they're trying to start the big one.
[02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:37.010]  Which could hurt my children and other people.
[02:13:37.210 --> 02:13:40.311]  And I'm getting sick of these wimps running their mouths, Roger!
[02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:41.691]  Running their damn mouths!
[02:13:42.031 --> 02:13:43.672]  Running their little cowardly-ass mouths!
[02:13:44.172 --> 02:13:46.252]  People aren't going to take this much longer, Roger!
[02:13:47.753 --> 02:13:50.713]  Well, Alex, the problem here is there seems to be two standards.
[02:13:51.393 --> 02:14:03.656]  The very people who bemoan the fact that there's no civility in our politics, who consistently say the President is rude and vulgar, are the exact same people who are constantly advocating violence,
[02:14:04.536 --> 02:14:08.298]  Who were paying to disrupt Donald Trump's campaign rallies.
[02:14:08.678 --> 02:14:16.742]  We know from the WikiLeaks disclosures that Hillary herself was a derriere deep in dirty tricks to disrupt Trump's rallies.
[02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:30.889]  The very people who go on Twitter and advocate the violent assassination of the president, the murder of his family, and worse, those are the people who the tech left has no problem with.
[02:14:31.369 --> 02:14:32.130]  Keith Olbermann?
[02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:33.732]  Oh yeah, he can threaten the president.
[02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:34.893]  Roger Stone?
[02:14:35.433 --> 02:14:39.057]  Hurts Jake Tapper's feelings, so we have to take him off Twitter.
[02:14:40.178 --> 02:14:45.783]  All I know is, America isn't going to put up with a violent coup carried out by the left.
[02:14:46.003 --> 02:14:52.670]  And I just hope they're smart and back off, but they don't have any real experience in this in themselves, so I don't think they realize how much danger they're in.
[02:14:53.888 --> 02:15:07.599]  Well, you saw in that clip of Congressman Swasey, whose only previous accomplishment is the enormous tax increases in Suffolk County when he was the county executive, making life there perhaps the most expensive place on the planet.
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:13.304]  But notice that Swasey says, what if the president refuses to obey the courts?
[02:15:14.033 --> 02:15:18.281]  Clearly, Mr. Suozzi doesn't know we have co-equal branches of government.
[02:15:18.742 --> 02:15:25.975]  And unfortunately, in some cases, very much like our FBI and our intelligence agencies, the courts have become politicized.
[02:15:26.553 --> 02:15:34.815]  Particularly left-wing judges on the West Coast who think they have the authority to block national policy, which the president has an authority to assert.
[02:15:35.015 --> 02:15:38.276]  And to tell people to resist ICE when they've got legal, lawful warrants.
[02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:40.737]  This is globalist insurrection in America.
[02:15:40.777 --> 02:15:42.217]  It's a foreign, multinational power.
[02:15:42.497 --> 02:15:43.318]  Shy combat.
[02:15:43.658 --> 02:15:53.781]  And I'm telling the military and the president and everybody else, I know you're already making preparations for this, but it's a clear and present danger, and I think we should deal with it starting about now.
[02:15:54.081 --> 02:15:54.981]  Roger, thank you so much.
[02:15:57.142 --> 02:16:07.507]  Info Wars, my radio program, our TV broadcast, our films, are among some of the biggest viral sensations in the last 20 years.
[02:16:08.207 --> 02:16:14.370]  And we're bringing back nationalism, we're bringing back sovereignty, we're bringing back true populism and rule
[02:16:14.850 --> 02:16:16.471]  For, of, and by the people.
[02:16:16.872 --> 02:16:31.063]  And that's why Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other mainstream media outlets, the modern robber barons of our age, admit, even in congressional hearings and in undercover videos, that the number one enemy to shut down is InfoWars.
[02:16:31.543 --> 02:16:46.495]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live,
[02:16:47.496 --> 02:16:57.020]  The top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror he was too busy bashing Trump.
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:01.562]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about
[02:17:03.035 --> 02:17:04.915]  This information being weaponized.
[02:17:05.856 --> 02:17:13.338]  How quickly can you act, and at least at some point in time, it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world?
[02:17:14.038 --> 02:17:17.639]  That's something we're thinking about all the time, because it's a bad user experience.
[02:17:17.939 --> 02:17:24.240]  The system self-corrected, that shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore, it should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[02:17:25.461 --> 02:17:26.241]  But you saw this?
[02:17:26.441 --> 02:17:27.221]  USA Today.
[02:17:27.601 --> 02:17:28.721]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[02:17:28.861 --> 02:17:31.162]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[02:17:31.602 --> 02:17:40.370]  At the very least, we can say that, like, this shelf of videos from news programs is legitimate news, because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[02:17:41.210 --> 02:17:46.235]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well...
[02:17:46.975 --> 02:17:48.776]  They were looking for him, not speaking with anyone.
[02:17:49.196 --> 02:17:55.139]  So they shadow ban our videos, they block our articles, they ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[02:17:55.639 --> 02:18:02.823]  That's why it's so essential that you continue to stand in the face of their censorship, because if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[02:18:03.403 --> 02:18:07.185]  But because of their brazenness, it's caused this Trizan effect.
[02:18:08.045 --> 02:18:15.653]  And they're now panicking because their attempts to censor us have only made the message expand and get out in ways it never would have.
[02:18:16.333 --> 02:18:18.075]  So I know a lot of you are smarter than I am.
[02:18:18.115 --> 02:18:19.997]  You've got great inventive ways to take action.
[02:18:20.497 --> 02:18:29.867]  But however you do it, spreading articles, spreading videos, on your own email list, telling friends and family about the censored information in person, however you do it, calling in to C-SPAN.
[02:18:31.389 --> 02:18:37.918]  Getting on other shows online, letting them know that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that if we can be censored successfully...
[02:18:39.113 --> 02:18:40.634]  All of you can be censored as well.
[02:18:41.095 --> 02:18:44.738]  So be sure and like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[02:18:45.018 --> 02:18:46.959]  Be sure to send out the videos, the articles.

[02:19:04.133 --> 02:19:04.313]  I think?
[02:19:24.324 --> 02:19:26.386]  It's evil, and together we're gonna defeat it.
[02:19:26.766 --> 02:19:39.274]  So folks, you have absolutely been the resistance, you have cut through all their propaganda, and because of that I salute you, and I ask you now, more than ever, to redouble your efforts, because if you're watching this transmission and listening, you are the resistance.
[02:19:50.642 --> 02:19:52.524]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[02:20:00.504 --> 02:20:03.246]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:03.806 --> 02:20:04.047]  Well!
[02:20:27.725 --> 02:20:28.685]  This is over a year ago.
[02:20:28.705 --> 02:20:29.325]  Hitler dog.
[02:20:29.365 --> 02:20:30.306]  Tens of millions of views.
[02:20:30.326 --> 02:20:34.087]  The guy said, I don't like Hitler, but I want to freak my girlfriend out and have the dog howl Hitler.
[02:20:34.487 --> 02:20:36.447]  Something that famous comedians have done as well.
[02:20:36.487 --> 02:20:37.228]  Tom Cleese.
[02:20:37.748 --> 02:20:38.708]  Of course, Charlie Chaplin.
[02:20:38.748 --> 02:20:40.188]  But now, he gets you convicted.
[02:20:40.208 --> 02:20:41.589]  He's facing six months in jail.
[02:20:42.129 --> 02:20:44.249]  That was announced by the London Guardian today.
[02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:44.990]  They're very proud of it.
[02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:46.250]  But here's the offending video.
[02:20:47.116 --> 02:20:52.838]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[02:20:53.919 --> 02:20:59.761]  And so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[02:21:01.622 --> 02:21:03.662]  Uda, do you want a gasta juice?
[02:21:04.463 --> 02:21:06.584]  Gasta juice?
[02:21:06.604 --> 02:21:06.944]  Juice.
[02:21:06.964 --> 02:21:07.244]  Juice.
[02:21:25.723 --> 02:21:29.473]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200.
[02:21:30.976 --> 02:21:31.678]  So there you go.
[02:21:31.718 --> 02:21:32.821]  That was over a year ago.
[02:21:32.921 --> 02:21:34.064]  Now, Mark Meacham.
[02:21:35.732 --> 02:21:39.373]  And of course, Tommy Robinson joins us to break this down.
[02:21:40.013 --> 02:21:41.033]  He's facing jail time.
[02:21:41.093 --> 02:21:45.515]  Tommy's been in jail for criticizing Islam and saying they were kidnapping little girls and grooming them.
[02:21:45.795 --> 02:21:51.516]  He's now been completely confirmed, including his hometown, 4,000 plus, some of which disappeared and were found dead.
[02:21:52.476 --> 02:21:54.577]  So, Mark and Tommy, join us.
[02:21:54.657 --> 02:21:56.357]  Mark, it's in the news today.
[02:21:56.417 --> 02:21:59.778]  The story is up on Infowars.com.
[02:22:00.498 --> 02:22:01.399]  That is YouTube.
[02:22:03.325 --> 02:22:07.008]  YouTuber convicted for offensive joke video faces prison.
[02:22:07.669 --> 02:22:11.252]  UK barely recognizable as a free country anymore.
[02:22:12.093 --> 02:22:16.176]  So Mark, this is being announced that you've been convicted.
[02:22:16.576 --> 02:22:18.018]  Tell us about that happening.
[02:22:18.038 --> 02:22:25.024]  I guess it's the last day and now I guess you're facing prison time for saying, I don't like Hitler.
[02:22:25.444 --> 02:22:27.206]  But I'm going to do a nasty joke here.
[02:22:27.226 --> 02:22:34.933]  Well, even if you liked Hitler, the Magna Carta and the law says, you know, you could say that, but this is next level.
[02:22:34.953 --> 02:22:36.254]  So tell us what's happening.
[02:22:38.056 --> 02:22:42.140]  Well, basically the judge turned around and confirmed that he was giving me a guilty verdict.
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:45.523]  Some of the things that he said alongside it, though, were extremely troubling.
[02:22:45.963 --> 02:22:50.628]  He turned around and says that he completely rejects the notion that this video was made as a joke.
[02:22:51.529 --> 02:23:01.617]  And he says that I made the video to be purposefully anti-Semitic and that the reason that I made the video was to spread anti-Semitic hatred and encourage anti-Semitic hatred.
[02:23:01.737 --> 02:23:06.020]  And what worries me about that so much is I know my intentions.
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:09.362]  I know why I made the video and it was to annoy my girlfriend.
[02:23:09.382 --> 02:23:10.623]  I know the truth.
[02:23:10.643 --> 02:23:12.745]  That is the reality of the situation.
[02:23:13.205 --> 02:23:18.449]  And what the judge has done is just completely rejected that and instead labelled me as an anti-Semite.
[02:23:19.611 --> 02:23:23.433]  And I've been found guilty of it, and then I'm due to be sentenced on the 23rd of April.
[02:23:23.933 --> 02:23:29.356]  So they've raped your rights already, and now they're raping what you stand for and who you are?
[02:23:30.697 --> 02:23:31.658]  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
[02:23:31.778 --> 02:23:39.422]  It's a huge attack on my character, because I don't exactly want to be known as that, especially when I know in my heart that that's not what I am.
[02:23:39.442 --> 02:23:45.365]  Like, I know what's in my head, but however, I'm kind of having it dictated to me who I am.
[02:23:46.772 --> 02:23:48.253]  Well, Mark, here's my issue.
[02:23:48.273 --> 02:23:49.914]  I mean, I know UK law, I know ours.
[02:23:49.934 --> 02:23:55.457]  I know they pass laws in Europe and there that are unconstitutional, but you, you argued, hey, I didn't mean this in this way.
[02:23:55.817 --> 02:24:11.147]  And I told you a year ago, I was like, man, I'd argue the whole thing's unconstitutional to begin with, because if somebody, now they're saying, oh, any criticism, you know, they're saying, arrest me for, you know, criticizing young people that are anti-gun.
[02:24:11.167 --> 02:24:13.048]  I mean, you can see the slippery slope here.
[02:24:14.494 --> 02:24:15.935]  Yeah, I can see it.
[02:24:15.975 --> 02:24:23.898]  Whenever the government tries to get 1% of control over anything, they will spend all of their time and money and power trying to turn that 1% into 100%.
[02:24:24.038 --> 02:24:26.680]  And we've seen that all the way through history.
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:40.246]  And it's like any government in any way, throughout history, has demonstrated throughout history, who has tried to curtail or stop freedom of speech, has never ever done so for honest reasons, ever in history.
[02:24:41.243 --> 02:24:44.666]  Well, yeah, Tommy points this out, Paul Watson points this out in these videos.
[02:24:44.786 --> 02:24:47.368]  Hundreds of known jihadis saying, I'm gonna murder, I'm gonna kill.
[02:24:47.868 --> 02:24:51.951]  And they're brought into the country and allowed to go around and preach they're gonna kill everybody.
[02:24:52.912 --> 02:24:58.116]  But then Tommy gets thrown in jail for stuff even less than you're about to be thrown in jail, Tommy.
[02:25:00.678 --> 02:25:05.421]  The worrying thing I'd say is that they've said, because it's a crime to be grossly offensive.
[02:25:06.242 --> 02:25:07.202]  Where does that stop?
[02:25:08.083 --> 02:25:10.585]  If I was to say to a Muslim... Well, that allows them to define it!
[02:25:11.798 --> 02:25:12.839]  That's exactly what it does.
[02:25:12.959 --> 02:25:19.442]  If I was to say to a Muslim, for example, Lauren Southern, who's just been stopped from coming into the country, she said, Allah is gay.
[02:25:20.322 --> 02:25:22.664]  If a Muslim finds that grossly offensive, is that now a crime?
[02:25:23.064 --> 02:25:24.084]  Are you going to arrest someone for that?
[02:25:24.945 --> 02:25:28.287]  If I point out a fact that Mohammed was a paedophile, will I be arrested for that?
[02:25:29.027 --> 02:25:32.789]  And this seems to be, I'd say that they've got in through the back door
[02:25:33.795 --> 02:25:36.718]  To prevent people being able to criticise any religion.
[02:25:37.179 --> 02:25:47.210]  Because, basically, if you set this as a precedent, which is what they do now with court cases, if someone's prosecuted, they will bring this case up and say the judge found that this man was guilty.
[02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:48.412]  Sure, they're setting precedents.
[02:25:48.432 --> 02:25:49.333]  They're setting precedents.
[02:25:50.216 --> 02:25:51.037]  They're saying Presidents.
[02:25:51.077 --> 02:25:54.640]  They're saying Presidents are... And the thing is, it is a complete joke.
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:55.541]  He says it's a joke.
[02:25:55.921 --> 02:25:58.583]  Three million people watched this video.
[02:25:58.603 --> 02:25:59.204]  It's more than that.
[02:25:59.284 --> 02:26:01.185]  And none of them complained.
[02:26:01.906 --> 02:26:02.607]  None of them complained.
[02:26:02.767 --> 02:26:03.908]  What they really fear is humour.
[02:26:07.355 --> 02:26:16.241]  What came out in court, Alex, was that the police went off their own back, off their own intelligence, to come and arrest Mark.
[02:26:16.641 --> 02:26:25.827]  They also notified the press, which was unheard of, so that before he'd been interviewed, before he'd even been arrested, the press were waiting outside to photograph, as one massive virtue signal.
[02:26:26.508 --> 02:26:28.752]  And that's basically what they've done.
[02:26:28.773 --> 02:26:29.193]  Yeah.
[02:26:29.233 --> 02:26:37.389]  But that virtue sibling will now result in the possibility that he's going to... Exactly, because under, for folks that don't know, under common law, English common law, US common law, Magna Carta, all of that...
[02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:40.141]  People are supposed to make the report.
[02:26:41.242 --> 02:26:45.585]  It's seen as very dangerous when the government itself goes out and does this.
[02:26:45.625 --> 02:26:51.088]  So they went out, they virtue-signaled, they got the media involved, knowing this would get a big viral attention.
[02:26:51.108 --> 02:26:59.674]  It was a viral story to set the precedent that even if you're more of a libertarian liberal, like Mark, and say, I don't like Hitler, we're going to put your ass in prison.
[02:27:00.014 --> 02:27:01.014]  I mean, that is so dangerous.
[02:27:01.275 --> 02:27:05.317]  That's, I mean, that's like, that's like you're living in North Korea or something, Mark.
[02:27:05.357 --> 02:27:06.338]  How is this for you to deal with?
[02:27:07.866 --> 02:27:13.309]  Well basically I've spent the last part of two years not being able to actually find a job or anything.
[02:27:13.769 --> 02:27:18.691]  As soon as I get a job anywhere within a week I get recognised and they just immediately file me on the spot.
[02:27:18.711 --> 02:27:24.694]  The only reason that I have a job just now is I'm working part time with friends and pretty much the majority of my income comes from YouTube.
[02:27:25.775 --> 02:27:27.176]  There's other stuff as well.
[02:27:27.196 --> 02:27:28.096]  I used to be a bouncer.
[02:27:28.216 --> 02:27:32.099]  That's what I used to do for a living, but I can't do that anymore.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:35.382]  Employment-wise, I've had pretty much every door closed.
[02:27:35.882 --> 02:27:38.144]  Think about political correctness.
[02:27:38.504 --> 02:27:44.068]  Blackballing you, destroying you, blacklisting you, just destroying your life.
[02:27:44.128 --> 02:27:45.389]  This is authoritarianism.
[02:27:46.463 --> 02:27:48.004]  It's called social consequences.
[02:27:48.044 --> 02:28:03.590]  What people will usually do is if they can't get you for your speech under the law, they'll do things called social consequences where they'll get the press to smear you, try and get your employers to fire you and then if none of that works what they usually do is turn up with masks on and beat you up and try and shut down your talks and de-platform you.
[02:28:04.091 --> 02:28:07.012]  It's just a classic far-left tactics is pretty much what it is.
[02:28:07.799 --> 02:28:18.408]  Well, when we come back, I want to ask you guys how we strike back, because I think that they have really, really jumped the shark on this in a big, big way, and I want to ask you where we go and what we do.
[02:28:18.428 --> 02:28:22.271]  I mean, I think everybody should really use your case in solidarity.
[02:28:22.591 --> 02:28:24.112]  This should go to your Supreme Court.
[02:28:25.213 --> 02:28:30.558]  They've defamed you, saying in the media that they're taking this down because you hurt Jewish people.
[02:28:30.898 --> 02:28:33.140]  They're speaking for you, and that's a defamation right there.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:34.281]  These bullies!
[02:28:34.921 --> 02:28:46.924]  need to pay for what they're doing trying to turn the UK into the very same anti-free speech prison that Europe is under the unelected dictatorship of the grandson of the richest Nazi family, Juncker.
[02:28:47.584 --> 02:28:51.925]  We'll be right back as we fight true Nazi policies in the name of fighting Nazis.
[02:28:52.185 --> 02:28:52.645]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.327 --> 02:29:02.228]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[02:29:03.399 --> 02:29:11.605]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[02:29:14.066 --> 02:29:20.190]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[02:29:21.611 --> 02:29:24.133]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[02:29:24.933 --> 02:29:28.356]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[02:29:29.296 --> 02:29:31.418]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[02:29:33.154 --> 02:29:38.336]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[02:29:40.277 --> 02:29:46.880]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[02:29:47.861 --> 02:29:48.861]  It's up to us personally.
[02:29:50.242 --> 02:29:57.085]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[02:29:57.605 --> 02:29:58.906]  I expected that to happen.
[02:30:00.086 --> 02:30:01.407]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:30:03.396 --> 02:30:14.322]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[02:30:15.023 --> 02:30:16.564]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[02:30:17.264 --> 02:30:28.891]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[02:30:29.471 --> 02:30:31.673]  And we've already come so far together
[02:30:32.694 --> 02:30:41.697]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[02:30:42.277 --> 02:30:47.679]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[02:30:48.819 --> 02:30:56.702]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[02:30:58.925 --> 02:31:07.193]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[02:31:07.533 --> 02:31:09.175]  That's a conservative estimate.
[02:31:10.176 --> 02:31:12.838]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[02:31:13.639 --> 02:31:15.461]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[02:31:15.501 --> 02:31:20.385]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[02:31:21.486 --> 02:31:32.239]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[02:31:32.299 --> 02:31:36.264]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:38.329]  Our game changing.
[02:31:38.769 --> 02:31:40.270]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:43.052]  Anti-fungus, anti-yeast, anti-mold for the gut.
[02:31:43.432 --> 02:31:44.573]  The other equation of probiotic.
[02:31:44.633 --> 02:31:48.216]  It's now stronger and a lower price in PolarStore.com.
[02:31:48.516 --> 02:31:49.637]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[02:31:49.717 --> 02:31:54.060]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:57.823]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[02:31:57.863 --> 02:31:58.963]  It just does incredible things.
[02:31:59.384 --> 02:32:00.865]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[02:32:00.885 --> 02:32:03.847]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[02:32:03.867 --> 02:32:06.409]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:32:06.929 --> 02:32:11.732]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[02:32:12.353 --> 02:32:23.501]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[02:32:23.961 --> 02:32:30.846]  Silver, salt, nanosilver, iodine, deionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[02:32:30.886 --> 02:32:32.027]  It's a disinfectant for the hands.
[02:32:32.547 --> 02:32:33.928]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[02:32:34.128 --> 02:32:35.209]  You can swallow it as well.
[02:32:35.689 --> 02:32:41.970]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:42.290 --> 02:32:43.671]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:32:43.691 --> 02:32:53.293]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:32:53.593 --> 02:32:56.693]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:33:00.514 --> 02:33:03.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.250 --> 02:33:21.393]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:22.154 --> 02:33:23.615]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.585 --> 02:33:39.728]  Mark Meakin is facing up to six months in jail and a fine.
[02:33:39.768 --> 02:33:44.872]  He was just convicted of hurting people's feelings as he did Hitler dog.
[02:33:45.785 --> 02:33:48.767]  You know, the funny thing is I have a video on YouTube called Hitler Dog.
[02:33:49.407 --> 02:33:51.929]  My late French Bulldog that died last year, Captain.
[02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:56.972]  And he looked like he had a Hitler mustache.
[02:33:57.032 --> 02:33:59.374]  And so I made the point that, remember J.C.
[02:33:59.434 --> 02:33:59.714]  Penney?
[02:34:00.315 --> 02:34:01.455]  This was like five years ago now.
[02:34:02.616 --> 02:34:03.036]  J.C.
[02:34:03.096 --> 02:34:08.860]  Penney banned a teapot because the reflection on it might look like Hitler.
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:12.583]  That's like looking at a cloud and thinking it's a giraffe or broccoli.
[02:34:14.199 --> 02:34:15.400]  Would that be banned as well?
[02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:17.021]  Because it's obviously funny.
[02:34:17.781 --> 02:34:19.082]  Just like John Cleese did.
[02:34:20.062 --> 02:34:21.483]  Just like everybody else has done.
[02:34:21.523 --> 02:34:25.925]  Charlie Chaplin saying you're pro-Hitler but making a joke.
[02:34:25.965 --> 02:34:30.388]  But even if you want to be a Nazi, you've got that right.
[02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:36.010]  And to have your dog howl Hitler, you could say, well, YouTube has its rules, you can't.
[02:34:37.291 --> 02:34:38.712]  Oh, but now you're arrested, see?
[02:34:40.376 --> 02:34:41.817]  That whole thing of, oh, it's their company.
[02:34:41.897 --> 02:34:43.038]  No, it wasn't even YouTube that did it.
[02:34:43.858 --> 02:34:44.879]  That's where this is going.
[02:34:44.919 --> 02:34:50.222]  That's the social justice warriors from the colleges in Europe, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia.
[02:34:50.623 --> 02:34:52.864]  They then are brought into the police departments.
[02:34:54.745 --> 02:35:03.411]  And it's frightening to see now radical Islamists being put in as police chiefs and mayors all over the place.
[02:35:05.089 --> 02:35:08.051]  By the way, I think this was funnier than the great dictator, Charlie Chaplin's.
[02:35:08.311 --> 02:35:09.411]  It was just great, well done.
[02:35:09.791 --> 02:35:11.352]  I think this is funnier than John Cleese.
[02:35:11.392 --> 02:35:14.234]  I think Chaplin's better than John Cleese at the Hitler imitations.
[02:35:15.054 --> 02:35:16.115]  And this is better.
[02:35:17.555 --> 02:35:18.836]  This is better than John Cleese.
[02:35:19.316 --> 02:35:19.957]  I'm serious.
[02:35:20.637 --> 02:35:21.858]  This is better than John Cleese.
[02:35:22.078 --> 02:35:23.358]  This is better than Charlie Chaplin.
[02:35:24.399 --> 02:35:26.040]  And his name's Mark Meekin.
[02:35:26.660 --> 02:35:28.441]  And he isn't getting a show on the BBC, baby.
[02:35:28.681 --> 02:35:29.862]  He's going to prison.
[02:35:30.967 --> 02:35:32.028]  Well, we know he'll be targeted.
[02:35:32.048 --> 02:35:33.409]  He just said he's getting fired, losing everything.
[02:35:33.729 --> 02:35:36.651]  So, Mark, I love the fact you have a good, jolly attitude about this.
[02:35:36.692 --> 02:35:39.093]  But, man, people, that's the problem with patriots, though.
[02:35:39.314 --> 02:35:40.715]  Just normal, common sense folks.
[02:35:40.735 --> 02:35:41.335]  We're not wimps.
[02:35:41.355 --> 02:35:42.116]  We don't grandstand.
[02:35:42.596 --> 02:35:44.518]  Everybody should be decrying this, my friend.
[02:35:45.058 --> 02:35:48.521]  I mean, you need to be given TV shows for your comedy genius.
[02:35:49.301 --> 02:35:51.823]  In fact, where is the original Hitler dog?
[02:35:51.843 --> 02:35:52.664]  What's the original name?
[02:35:52.904 --> 02:35:53.685]  Where is it in mirrors?
[02:35:53.745 --> 02:35:55.106]  All I have is Paul playing a clip of it.
[02:35:55.486 --> 02:35:57.328]  Where do we find this forbidden fruit?
[02:35:58.657 --> 02:36:00.139]  YouTube removed it.
[02:36:00.159 --> 02:36:05.203]  I haven't got it re-uploaded anywhere else because the original crime itself was actually me posting the video online.
[02:36:05.544 --> 02:36:08.266]  Like, me being in the video and stuff like that.
[02:36:08.286 --> 02:36:12.790]  So maybe I should fly to the UK, publicly upload this at Peekers Speaker's Corner.
[02:36:12.851 --> 02:36:17.094]  I mean, or John Cleese, have you noticed John Cleese has come out and said this is wrong?
[02:36:19.016 --> 02:36:20.297]  I didn't know, I didn't see that.
[02:36:20.317 --> 02:36:22.780]  I mean, he's come out and said all this political correctness is very dangerous.
[02:36:23.886 --> 02:36:25.187]  Political correctness, yeah.
[02:36:25.267 --> 02:36:28.250]  Political correctness is essentially just trying to curtail comedy as a whole.
[02:36:28.791 --> 02:36:32.334]  It's essentially, people seem to think that just because they get offended they have some kind of right.
[02:36:32.714 --> 02:36:37.358]  That immediately means that my opinion trumps everybody else's in the rooms because my feelings are hurt.
[02:36:37.759 --> 02:36:38.960]  And that's not how it works.
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:43.104]  But for some reason, society is starting to believe that that is how things work.
[02:36:43.564 --> 02:36:45.826]  It's a case of, they're your emotions, you manage them.
[02:36:46.186 --> 02:36:50.050]  Don't expect everybody else in the world to change just because you can't manage your own feelings.
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:55.521]  Well, I mean, why did the Jewish leader go and say it was grossly offensive?
[02:36:55.841 --> 02:36:58.921]  Doesn't he understand that's like Nazi Germany to lock somebody up for their speech?
[02:36:59.922 --> 02:37:00.522]  That's his job.
[02:37:00.942 --> 02:37:03.182]  In the position it is.
[02:37:03.362 --> 02:37:04.823]  His job is to find the outrage.
[02:37:04.923 --> 02:37:08.243]  I actually have a very large fan base in Israel.
[02:37:08.683 --> 02:37:14.364]  All of them are practicing Jews and one thing that they really, really don't like being perpetuated is the victim complex.
[02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:16.805]  See if there's something that is like a genuine
[02:37:17.325 --> 02:37:18.086]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:37:32.463 --> 02:37:32.883]  We're good to go.
[02:37:52.714 --> 02:37:54.896]  Fucking hell, don't try and send the guy to prison.
[02:37:55.276 --> 02:38:02.382]  So a lot of Jews around the world are actually very unhappy with what's actually happened with this entire thing, even if they didn't like the joke itself.
[02:38:03.536 --> 02:38:05.097]  Alright, we caught both of those.
[02:38:05.117 --> 02:38:08.158]  We're on a bunch of commercial radio stations and TV stations, so please don't cuss anymore.
[02:38:08.418 --> 02:38:09.438]  I understand you can in the UK.
[02:38:09.458 --> 02:38:10.098]  It's no big deal, Mark.
[02:38:10.118 --> 02:38:10.618]  You're not bad.
[02:38:10.638 --> 02:38:14.240]  It's just that our delay then has to build back up, so we want to do that for our affiliates.
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:17.201]  Tommy, you've been sitting here very quietly.
[02:38:17.221 --> 02:38:19.041]  You're a man who first rang the alarm bell.
[02:38:19.061 --> 02:38:19.802]  They lied about you.
[02:38:19.822 --> 02:38:22.383]  They put you in prison for you lost your house.
[02:38:22.703 --> 02:38:23.803]  The Muslims tried to kill you.
[02:38:24.163 --> 02:38:26.604]  I mean, what is it like seeing this expand and see the UK?
[02:38:26.624 --> 02:38:28.305]  I mean, I'm pinching myself.
[02:38:29.045 --> 02:38:30.445]  This is truly authoritarian.
[02:38:30.485 --> 02:38:32.266]  This is super dangerous.
[02:38:32.746 --> 02:38:37.191]  In the country where free speech in the modern tense 800 years ago began.
[02:38:39.153 --> 02:38:44.258]  What it's like for me is, I know full well what it's like to go through a court case and to have it hanging over your head.
[02:38:44.298 --> 02:38:48.603]  Which is why when I met Mark and I speak to him, I'll ask, how is it for your mother?
[02:38:48.743 --> 02:38:50.124]  This isn't just a sentence.
[02:38:50.445 --> 02:38:52.587]  Even the fact that they've put it off for another month now.
[02:38:53.340 --> 02:39:02.903]  That there, even the fact that they could have dealt with it today, it's still to teach a lesson, still for the longer, so that this cloud's hanging over you, you're constantly worrying.
[02:39:03.363 --> 02:39:05.563]  I watched today as his missus and they sat and held hands.
[02:39:05.603 --> 02:39:20.087]  I watched the panic and the fear on her face and the worry on her face and that's what gets to me because I know, I know what my wife's gone through, I know what my mum's gone through, I know what my children go through, so I know when they're doing this to Mark, they're doing it to his family and I know that
[02:39:21.123 --> 02:39:33.883]  This attack, which is a current attack that we're witnessing, whilst I don't want to sound like I think it's good, but anything that highlights to the public and to the world just how far our country shifted
[02:39:34.551 --> 02:39:38.956]  I think it's beneficial in the sense that we need the public to be awake to this.
[02:39:39.356 --> 02:39:40.797]  We need people to realise this.
[02:39:40.937 --> 02:39:43.140]  Because it's like a chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:45.282]  They chip away at our rights and our freedoms.
[02:39:45.622 --> 02:39:53.250]  And over the last ten days, what with Brittany Pettibone, Martin Sellner, Lauren Southern, Lutz Backman and now Mark,
[02:39:54.452 --> 02:39:55.993]  It's all there for the world to see.
[02:39:56.474 --> 02:40:00.757]  Everyone can see that we now live, how we're living under an authoritarian government.
[02:40:01.037 --> 02:40:10.325]  And the reason it's important is, I'll see headlines, BBC, 5,000 racists arrested, police secretly overheard them in cafes saying political incorrectness.
[02:40:10.785 --> 02:40:12.206]  I saw that six, seven years ago.
[02:40:12.726 --> 02:40:14.348]  So it's going on behind the scenes.
[02:40:14.408 --> 02:40:16.169]  Most people get too scared to speak out.
[02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:17.710]  You guys are speaking out.
[02:40:17.971 --> 02:40:23.295]  That's the final piece of the equation, bringing this evil, this creeping death out in the open, Tommy.
[02:40:25.367 --> 02:40:26.848]  This is to send a message.
[02:40:26.928 --> 02:40:28.849]  What they've done to Mark is to send a message.
[02:40:28.889 --> 02:40:31.230]  And this message works, unfortunately.
[02:40:31.690 --> 02:40:41.575]  The people who would have been making jokes and making crude comments and having a laugh and a bit of banter about religions, be it Judaism, Christianity or Islam, will now be scared to.
[02:40:42.426 --> 02:40:43.528]  They will now be scared to.
[02:40:43.908 --> 02:40:52.299]  And that's why for the last 10 years, or for longer, people have been walking on eggshells and treading on eggshells, constantly scared.
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:56.305]  And these actions by the government and the police only add to that.
[02:40:56.325 --> 02:40:57.026]  And they know that.
[02:40:57.526 --> 02:40:59.107]  And they know that, and that's what this is about.
[02:40:59.147 --> 02:41:06.291]  This is about silencing the public so that no one will challenge what they're doing, no one will speak up, and no one will even be able to joke.
[02:41:06.391 --> 02:41:07.451]  This is how far it's gone.
[02:41:07.952 --> 02:41:15.056]  It's gone that far that rather than people making crude comments or speaking online in a negative way about religions, people are having a joke.
[02:41:15.376 --> 02:41:23.820]  Part of being British is... And what people realise is that whether it be distasteful or dark humour, that's what British people find funny.
[02:41:24.501 --> 02:41:26.922]  And that's what they've now made against the law.
[02:41:27.881 --> 02:41:31.227]  And I said there is an option to appeal this.
[02:41:32.128 --> 02:41:34.032]  There is an option to appeal this, but it costs...
[02:41:34.707 --> 02:41:35.487]  How much did they say?
[02:41:35.908 --> 02:41:38.329]  I think it was estimated it would be around £50,000.
[02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:40.030]  So they win again?
[02:41:40.050 --> 02:41:42.571]  Well, you need to have lawyers and barristers come forward.
[02:41:42.591 --> 02:41:45.772]  There needs to be organisations that are pro-free speech.
[02:41:46.032 --> 02:41:48.293]  You're having your whole future stolen.
[02:41:48.313 --> 02:41:56.657]  And again, when Charlie Chaplin did The Dictator, where it looks pro-Hitler and he's bouncing the world off his butt, you could say someone is offended by that.
[02:41:57.978 --> 02:42:00.019]  I think it makes Hitler look like he's in a good light.
[02:42:00.179 --> 02:42:00.939]  Obviously it doesn't.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:02.880]  You can't operate like this.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:03.881]  This is pure tyranny.
[02:42:06.087 --> 02:42:13.609]  It's just, it's actually gotten to the point, the thing that frightens me the most is the fact that your intent and context do not matter.
[02:42:14.009 --> 02:42:20.330]  It's the case of, you know exactly what you meant by what you said, but another person who's usually... But you said I don't like Hitler!
[02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:24.871]  You said I don't like Nazis, so it's gonna be fine to make the dog do something bad.
[02:42:26.051 --> 02:42:28.992]  But you should be able to say I like them, even, you know, it's crazy.
[02:42:29.412 --> 02:42:30.072]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:31.238 --> 02:42:31.718]  It's unbelievable.
[02:42:31.759 --> 02:42:33.019]  It's total authoritarianism.
[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:35.781]  And then we get into it and go, oh, we didn't mean it like that.
[02:42:35.841 --> 02:42:36.482]  They don't care.
[02:42:36.662 --> 02:42:40.004]  They are the ones bringing in the Hitler lovers.
[02:42:40.064 --> 02:42:42.366]  They are the ones bringing in the Islamists.
[02:42:42.406 --> 02:42:44.427]  They are the ones crushing the West.
[02:42:44.507 --> 02:42:45.648]  They are the globalists.
[02:42:45.908 --> 02:42:46.949]  They are the plague.
[02:42:47.209 --> 02:42:49.230]  Hitler wanted to get rid of free speech and Christianity.
[02:42:49.531 --> 02:42:50.511]  They are the enemy.
[02:42:50.571 --> 02:42:51.432]  They are Hitler.
[02:42:56.667 --> 02:43:05.676]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:05.757 --> 02:43:13.865]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:14.165 --> 02:43:18.847]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:19.027 --> 02:43:25.769]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:25.829 --> 02:43:32.912]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:32.992 --> 02:43:39.854]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:40.014 --> 02:43:44.379]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:44.499 --> 02:43:47.762]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:47.903 --> 02:43:54.029]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:43:54.209 --> 02:43:56.372]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:44:00.202 --> 02:44:01.963]  William Binney is our guest.
[02:44:02.484 --> 02:44:09.389]  He is the former technical leader of the intelligence with NSA before becoming a whistleblower in 2001 after more than 30 years of the agency.
[02:44:09.729 --> 02:44:12.871]  Binney's been described as one of the best analysts and codebreakers in NSA history.
[02:44:13.552 --> 02:44:17.695]  And again, he is the technical advisor for the film Snowden.
[02:44:18.315 --> 02:44:19.136]  That is so amazing.
[02:44:19.456 --> 02:44:24.378]  Again, this was published today at the Director of National Intelligence website.
[02:44:25.138 --> 02:44:30.061]  William Benny, who's been advising the CIA Director and others, let us know the minute it went out.
[02:44:30.121 --> 02:44:42.286]  This is the secret memo that's so troubling that ties into all the perjury and the cabal of Clinton operatives trying to set the President and others up using the might of the surveillance grid that's meant for foreign powers against the American people.
[02:44:42.406 --> 02:44:44.287]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:44:44.487 --> 02:44:46.068]  William Benny, start wherever you think's best.
[02:44:48.277 --> 02:45:04.233]  I'd like to start with some of the things they're talking about on page 15 of that ruling, where they talked about NSA having the authority to go in the upstream program and take down main communications trunks.
[02:45:06.015 --> 02:45:10.079]  And because I think there's some terrorist or dope dealer on there.
[02:45:10.546 --> 02:45:13.848]  And they can capture and keep the entire trunk line.
[02:45:14.168 --> 02:45:16.210]  Capture all the data and keep it all.
[02:45:16.610 --> 02:45:18.811]  And sort it and interrogate it.
[02:45:18.871 --> 02:45:22.394]  That's basically how NSA analysts are able to look at their lovers.
[02:45:22.414 --> 02:45:23.454]  They're cheating on them.
[02:45:23.494 --> 02:45:24.455]  That's how they can do that.
[02:45:24.915 --> 02:45:25.796]  Under that authority.
[02:45:25.856 --> 02:45:27.076]  But that's all done in secret.
[02:45:27.177 --> 02:45:28.858]  The FISA court is a secret.
[02:45:28.878 --> 02:45:30.439]  They're in their ruling.
[02:45:30.539 --> 02:45:31.659]  This is the upstream program.
[02:45:31.679 --> 02:45:34.121]  It's the taps on the fiber lines where they take everything.
[02:45:34.756 --> 02:45:46.306]  And that's really what I was trying to say about President Trump when he was being targeted in all the data they were collecting, including his entire staff on this committee and everything.
[02:45:46.686 --> 02:45:52.451]  They were all being spoofed up in this bulk acquisition off the fiber lines in the Upstream program.
[02:45:53.191 --> 02:45:56.814]  And the main slide that would show it, if you could put it up, is the Fairview program.
[02:45:57.375 --> 02:46:01.398]  That is AT&T's tapping points inside the 48 states of the United States.
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:08.126]  And you notice all the tap points are distributed with... This is the one that no mainstream media wants to show on TV.
[02:46:08.686 --> 02:46:13.130]  Because this is the one that calls out this business about they're only after foreigners is an obvious lie.
[02:46:13.331 --> 02:46:21.658]  You know, unless you face them and go after them and do something about this, you're not going to correct the problem in the future and people will look back and say, well, they got away with it, so I'll do it too.
[02:46:21.979 --> 02:46:25.442]  That's why I blamed this all on Jerry Ford when he pardoned Nixon, you know?
[02:46:25.962 --> 02:46:28.723]  When he did that, he said every president can do anything he wants.
[02:46:28.763 --> 02:46:30.523]  He's now got to get out of jail free card.
[02:46:30.543 --> 02:46:33.764]  That's the next president, who also wants to be able to do whatever he wants.
[02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:38.285]  So you see, that was where I put the blame right there with Jerry Ford.
[02:46:38.345 --> 02:46:44.706]  And if he had let Nixon go to trial and be indicted, then I don't believe that this would have happened.
[02:46:45.026 --> 02:46:48.227]  But we haven't done any indictments of any of these people who have done similar crimes.
[02:46:48.307 --> 02:46:51.168]  And now, for massive crimes, we haven't done any of that.
[02:46:51.188 --> 02:46:52.728]  And that's really what we need to do.
[02:47:00.026 --> 02:47:06.271]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.781 --> 02:47:19.082]  Cheers.
[02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:44.799]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live and I didn't even think to ask, after he's been convicted of being a thought criminal, our guest Mark Meakin is here with the great Tommy Robinson there in London, and I said where is
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:46.881]  Where is Hitler Dog?
[02:47:46.961 --> 02:47:48.502]  And I'm going to out the dog.
[02:47:48.882 --> 02:47:51.964]  Buda is the real name of his girlfriend's pug.
[02:47:51.984 --> 02:47:53.705]  A very handsome, very large pug.
[02:47:53.725 --> 02:47:56.166]  I noticed his feet were up earlier and I said, get those down.
[02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:57.347]  That's more prison time.
[02:47:57.387 --> 02:47:58.647]  A double Heil Hitler.
[02:47:58.667 --> 02:47:59.728]  But we're joking here.
[02:48:00.608 --> 02:48:05.851]  So Mark and Tommy, introduce the world to the dreaded Hitlerian creature.
[02:48:07.092 --> 02:48:10.414]  This is Buda, future Chancellor of the Fourth Reich.
[02:48:12.901 --> 02:48:22.197]  This is apparently the dog that I was using as a smoke screen to quote the prosecutor's own words to secretly spread my truly Nazi and anti-Semitic views.
[02:48:22.637 --> 02:48:24.220]  He says that I was basically trying to use this
[02:48:25.484 --> 02:48:34.974]  By the way, that's critical to the left, because they know there's not a lot of real Nazis.
[02:48:34.994 --> 02:48:39.859]  They want to say everything's coded and want to arrest you for the coded stuff so they can then go after everybody.
[02:48:39.879 --> 02:48:40.880]  And that's what they have said.
[02:48:41.681 --> 02:48:47.108]  When I said Brian Stelter looks like a demon, they said, well, he's not really Jewish, Mr. Jones.
[02:48:47.148 --> 02:48:48.590]  I never said Brian Stelter was Jewish.
[02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:49.672]  It's like mental illness.
[02:48:50.032 --> 02:48:51.534]  I said, Brian Stelter looks like a demon.
[02:48:51.875 --> 02:48:54.738]  And they go, Jones only said it because he thought he's Jewish, but he's not.
[02:48:54.758 --> 02:48:56.060]  And then I never said that.
[02:48:56.821 --> 02:49:00.443]  I said, who would put out PR photos where they have this demonic looking Joker grin?
[02:49:00.724 --> 02:49:06.528]  You know, I'm not saying that the guy that plays the Joker, Jack Nicholson, is Jewish either.
[02:49:06.808 --> 02:49:10.790]  I mean, it's like seeing Hitler in the teapot.
[02:49:10.810 --> 02:49:12.271]  Can we see Hitler dog again, please?
[02:49:12.291 --> 02:49:12.612]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:14.513 --> 02:49:14.793]  Buddha.
[02:49:16.254 --> 02:49:17.755]  Hey, you guys call Buddha back.
[02:49:17.775 --> 02:49:18.095]  Sorry.
[02:49:18.415 --> 02:49:19.116]  Buddha's a rock star.
[02:49:19.476 --> 02:49:21.157]  You guys have got the floor for the time we've got left.
[02:49:21.197 --> 02:49:21.577]  I'm ranting.
[02:49:21.838 --> 02:49:23.519]  What else do you want to impart to listeners and viewers?
[02:49:25.578 --> 02:49:30.159]  Um, there's not really much else I can say except, like, all of this is pretty much his fault.
[02:49:30.179 --> 02:49:32.480]  Like, I just held the camera.
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:33.920]  I didn't really do anything.
[02:49:33.980 --> 02:49:34.421]  It's all him.
[02:49:34.761 --> 02:49:36.841]  Look at his face as well.
[02:49:38.102 --> 02:49:39.182]  This is what it's all about!
[02:49:39.202 --> 02:49:41.242]  He could be going to jail because of this!
[02:49:41.262 --> 02:49:42.103]  I really like that.
[02:49:42.123 --> 02:49:42.803]  That's a good looking pug.
[02:49:44.051 --> 02:49:52.675]  Well, you know, he's actually Japanese and English, because French Bulldogs originally got bred down by the lacemakers there, and then exported to the ladies of the night in Paris.
[02:49:52.695 --> 02:49:54.936]  That's how they got popularized 250 years ago.
[02:49:55.576 --> 02:49:58.998]  But the pug, I guess, is from China and Japan, or a part of what it is.
[02:49:59.358 --> 02:50:01.879]  So this is not a Nazi dog here.
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:03.440]  No.
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:09.762]  A lot of people, especially the media, don't seem to realize that a dog can't exactly choose its place on the political spectrum.
[02:50:09.782 --> 02:50:12.864]  That's a good looking animal.
[02:50:13.775 --> 02:50:15.297]  I bet your girlfriend likes Buddha.
[02:50:16.739 --> 02:50:17.801]  Oh, she likes him more than me.
[02:50:18.442 --> 02:50:19.323]  Yeah, easily.
[02:50:19.824 --> 02:50:20.905]  Which is what the joke was about?
[02:50:21.126 --> 02:50:22.488]  Yeah, that pretty much was it.
[02:50:22.688 --> 02:50:23.830]  I just wanted to piss her off.
[02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:25.412]  I might be going to jail for it.
[02:50:26.874 --> 02:50:28.076]  What does your girlfriend think about this now?
[02:50:30.165 --> 02:50:38.508]  She's just, well she's not angry at me anymore, she's kind of angry mostly at the justice system and stuff like that, just for all the shit that's basically been put through over the last two years.
[02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:41.590]  She just really wants this to be over and just wants it to move on.
[02:50:42.090 --> 02:50:49.213]  Nazi pug as a whole has been pretty much a dead meme for quite a while now, but the courts are keeping it alive for some reason.
[02:50:49.733 --> 02:50:51.173]  But I just kind of want this.
[02:50:51.213 --> 02:50:54.995]  I'm hoping it will finally come to an end, you know, next month, better for worse.
[02:50:55.731 --> 02:50:56.191]  Hopefully for Bill.
[02:50:56.211 --> 02:50:59.673]  Well, I've seen a lot of cute pugs, but that's a particularly cute pug right there.
[02:50:59.693 --> 02:51:00.774]  He looks really sweet.
[02:51:01.074 --> 02:51:01.754]  Is Buddha a boy?
[02:51:02.835 --> 02:51:03.375]  Yeah, he's a boy.
[02:51:03.395 --> 02:51:05.716]  He's not a happy being up here, though.
[02:51:05.736 --> 02:51:07.837]  We could use an improper gender pronoun, actually.
[02:51:07.857 --> 02:51:09.618]  You could get some prison time for that in California.
[02:51:09.698 --> 02:51:09.978]  Zee.
[02:51:10.679 --> 02:51:11.259]  Zee.
[02:51:11.299 --> 02:51:12.520]  Missed gendering my dog.
[02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:13.240]  Zee.
[02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:14.181]  That's actually a cat.
[02:51:14.481 --> 02:51:15.941]  What if your dog identifies as a cat?
[02:51:19.643 --> 02:51:20.644]  I don't know, I'll need to ask him.
[02:51:22.834 --> 02:51:26.097]  But seriously, they're talking six months fines.
[02:51:26.117 --> 02:51:31.883]  I mean, I guess if you grovel to them and apologize, they might not let you get prison time.
[02:51:31.923 --> 02:51:37.829]  But if you don't roll over and get down on your knees before the authoritarian judge and people, I guess they're going to throw the book at you.
[02:51:38.830 --> 02:51:40.031]  Yeah, it's up to a year.
[02:51:40.391 --> 02:51:41.372]  I could actually get in prison.
[02:51:41.753 --> 02:51:42.153]  It's up to a year.
[02:51:42.173 --> 02:51:43.975]  They're not going to let Paul change his article?
[02:51:43.995 --> 02:51:44.475]  A year?
[02:51:44.615 --> 02:51:44.795]  Wow.
[02:51:45.717 --> 02:51:45.957]  Yeah.
[02:51:46.997 --> 02:51:50.458]  Yeah, but like, it's a case of, I have absolutely no idea at this point.
[02:51:50.478 --> 02:52:02.701]  They're basically deferring sentence for background reports, but one of the things that I would need to do as well is I need to visit a court social worker so that I can get an assessment to see whether or not they should slap a restriction of liberty.
[02:52:02.721 --> 02:52:14.604]  I can't remember the full name of it, but it's a restriction of liberty order on me, which basically means that I would need to wear a GPS tracker tag and I would be under house arrest until I'm sentenced in April.
[02:52:15.385 --> 02:52:17.587]  So that's something that I need to do in the next few days as well.
[02:52:31.357 --> 02:52:33.158]  I'd say the UK is about two years behind Europe.
[02:52:33.498 --> 02:52:34.558]  Germany, Sweden, everywhere.
[02:52:34.618 --> 02:52:35.318]  It's already there.
[02:52:35.698 --> 02:52:37.379]  Former Stasi hired to run Facebook.
[02:52:37.679 --> 02:52:38.719]  Now it's in the UK.
[02:52:38.799 --> 02:52:39.540]  Now it's coming here.
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:40.940]  They mean business.
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:43.881]  So we sit around and we joke about all this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:44.181 --> 02:52:46.882]  This is deadly, deadly serious.
[02:52:47.222 --> 02:52:50.203]  Doesn't matter your ancestors were bombed by the Nazis or fought the Nazis.
[02:52:50.483 --> 02:52:50.963]  Doesn't matter.
[02:52:51.003 --> 02:52:57.846]  It's projected by people who actually are what I call the cultural and spiritual children of the Nazis.
[02:52:59.326 --> 02:53:01.387]  Tommy, Mark, any other key points?
[02:53:04.127 --> 02:53:06.988]  I'll just say that this is, it's ongoing.
[02:53:07.729 --> 02:53:18.572]  I know that we had a, we had a triumphant day last Sunday for free speech in Speaker's Corner in London, but this is, when they, that's the only positive I'll take from it.
[02:53:18.592 --> 02:53:25.854]  When they make these decisions, when they do this, it's for the world to see and thankfully for shows like this and thankfully for the internet.
[02:53:26.494 --> 02:53:33.039]  Because if it wasn't for that, if they get their way, if they get their way, no one would even be knowing about this case because everyone will be silenced eventually.
[02:53:33.419 --> 02:53:34.620]  And that's the route we see it going down.
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:37.262]  I don't know if you saw Sadiq Khan last week was in Texas.
[02:53:37.842 --> 02:53:39.103]  I interviewed a lady yesterday.
[02:53:39.343 --> 02:53:42.266]  You should probably have her on your show, Alex.
[02:53:42.546 --> 02:53:43.527]  I interviewed a lady yesterday.
[02:53:43.787 --> 02:53:44.787]  She's a Muslim lady.
[02:53:45.108 --> 02:53:45.928]  She was born a Muslim.
[02:53:46.589 --> 02:53:48.230]  She was into a forced marriage.
[02:53:48.290 --> 02:53:48.910]  She was raped.
[02:53:49.471 --> 02:53:53.654]  She experienced all the bad parts from the cultural problems that are within Islam.
[02:53:54.494 --> 02:53:58.396]  And then she messaged Sadiq Khan and put out a tweet about knife crime.
[02:53:58.836 --> 02:54:07.960]  And she replied saying, if someone takes a knife and hacks away the vagina of a child, will the full force of the law come down on them?
[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:13.482]  Now what he did is he spoke in Texas and his speech was about hate speech.
[02:54:13.882 --> 02:54:14.802]  And it's all about this.
[02:54:14.902 --> 02:54:17.183]  It's all about silencing and stopping people talking.
[02:54:17.724 --> 02:54:21.065]  And he used her tweet as an example of hate speech.
[02:54:22.097 --> 02:54:23.700]  I interviewed her yesterday.
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:25.062]  She's a gorgeous lady.
[02:54:25.102 --> 02:54:27.847]  So she's born a Muslim.
[02:54:28.027 --> 02:54:29.009]  She's now an ex-Muslim.
[02:54:29.654 --> 02:54:34.236]  She fights for Muslim children and Muslim women who are still within it for their rights.
[02:54:34.617 --> 02:54:38.018]  And here's Sadiq Khan, putting her up on a pedestal as a hate preacher.
[02:54:38.318 --> 02:54:43.181]  He's actually using one of the victims of these crimes to try and silence other people who want the truth.
[02:54:43.201 --> 02:54:43.701]  I saw this.
[02:54:43.721 --> 02:54:46.503]  Tell people the lady's name so they can see the interview, but I saw pieces of it.
[02:54:46.523 --> 02:54:48.224]  This was incredible about the leftists and the Islamists.
[02:54:48.804 --> 02:54:51.005]  They know that it's Islam that's cutting the genitals off.
[02:54:51.245 --> 02:54:52.486]  They know the left doesn't know that.
[02:54:53.331 --> 02:55:06.687]  So he uses this threatening tweet he got, saying somebody wants to cut his genitals off or something, when he knows full well it's a woman saying, help us, they're hurting us, he takes how she's been abused and raped and sliced, and he makes it about him!
[02:55:07.008 --> 02:55:08.470]  A perfect Islamic man!
[02:55:08.730 --> 02:55:10.172]  A perfect piece of filth!
[02:55:11.774 --> 02:55:17.940]  Shazia Hobbs her name was, and our interview will be going out probably today stroke tomorrow, but she wrote a letter to Sadiq Khan about it.
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:18.860]  She wrote a letter to him.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:23.684]  And then he used it to spin it that she was talking about chopping him.
[02:55:24.865 --> 02:55:30.010]  Yeah, he used it as a part of the hate speech that he faces.
[02:55:30.250 --> 02:55:31.331]  Do you know what else he spoke about?
[02:55:31.411 --> 02:55:33.573]  One of the things, he said, I get called a pigeon.
[02:55:34.313 --> 02:55:34.754]  So what?
[02:55:35.539 --> 02:55:37.000]  So what if you get called a pigeon?
[02:55:37.381 --> 02:55:38.602]  You're a public figure!
[02:55:38.722 --> 02:55:39.803]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:39.823 --> 02:55:42.265]  There's no free speech back in Pakistan or wherever you came from.
[02:55:42.285 --> 02:55:49.030]  Do you know what the worst thing is, the most frustrating thing is, in this circumstance, is when you look at what Marx has been prosecuted of.
[02:55:49.630 --> 02:55:52.453]  If I go through, if I read you this, I've received this today.
[02:55:52.713 --> 02:55:54.174]  I receive these every day.
[02:55:54.194 --> 02:55:56.436]  No one's ever prosecuted.
[02:55:57.481 --> 02:56:03.443]  I hope you're forced to watch as your family have their veins ripped from their arms.
[02:56:03.903 --> 02:56:10.084]  This is a man who's threatening death upon my family.
[02:56:10.965 --> 02:56:15.926]  Now that doesn't qualify under their hate speech because I'm white, straight and working class.
[02:56:17.572 --> 02:56:21.914]  If anyone says anything against a minority, there's no level playing field.
[02:56:21.934 --> 02:56:24.936]  It's not like we're just... And Muslims are a majority and they're taking over.
[02:56:24.956 --> 02:56:26.737]  Tommy, I want to talk to you both as this unfolds.
[02:56:27.377 --> 02:56:29.618]  Let's talk about your YouTube, where people can go.
[02:56:29.898 --> 02:56:32.660]  YouTube.com forward slash countdankula.
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:34.461]  Twitter countdankulatv.
[02:56:34.501 --> 02:56:35.161]  Mark, thank you.
[02:56:35.401 --> 02:56:35.981]  Tommy, thank you.
[02:56:36.062 --> 02:56:36.762]  You guys are awesome.
[02:56:37.711 --> 02:56:38.091]  Thank you, man.
[02:57:01.235 --> 02:57:02.615]  Let folks purchase the products.
[02:57:03.196 --> 02:57:07.417]  It is critical that all of you go to Infowarstore.com.
[02:57:07.777 --> 02:57:08.957]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:57:09.397 --> 02:57:10.658]  I get so focused on the news.
[02:57:10.978 --> 02:57:12.118]  This is how we fund our operation.
[02:57:12.138 --> 02:57:13.959]  You know, they've taken our sponsors and all the rest of it.
[02:57:14.179 --> 02:57:15.659]  You hear local sponsors support those.
[02:57:15.879 --> 02:57:16.400]  That's local.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:19.060]  National, you know, the network's got some, but I fund myself.
[02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:20.621]  Are you buying books, t-shirts?
[02:57:20.641 --> 02:57:23.442]  We've got a limited edition t-shirt of the month, Trump 2020.
[02:57:24.802 --> 02:57:26.865]  And it says, Keeping America Great with a new slogan.

[02:57:54.389 --> 02:58:06.735]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[02:58:07.475 --> 02:58:18.044]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[02:58:18.545 --> 02:58:25.311]  InfoWars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[02:58:25.931 --> 02:58:40.022]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:58:40.582 --> 02:58:43.244]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:58:46.687 --> 02:58:49.891]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:58:50.331 --> 02:58:51.653]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:58:52.133 --> 02:59:03.565]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:59:04.346 --> 02:59:13.273]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:59:13.673 --> 02:59:24.381]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:59:24.901 --> 02:59:27.203]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:59:27.544 --> 02:59:28.905]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:59:29.305 --> 02:59:38.915]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:59:39.015 --> 02:59:41.157]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:59:41.698 --> 02:59:46.583]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:59:49.389 --> 02:59:53.472]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:54.013 --> 02:59:55.334]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.740 --> 03:00:06.263]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:06.824 --> 03:00:08.625]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.606 --> 03:00:12.728]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:15.591]  Run on for a long time.
[03:00:18.443 --> 03:00:20.566]  Alright, I want to air part of this Millie Weaver report.
[03:00:20.806 --> 03:00:21.808]  Live in a bubble.
[03:00:21.988 --> 03:00:23.870]  Abort your kids and never own guns or cars.
[03:00:24.090 --> 03:00:25.092]  It's too long of a segment.
[03:00:25.112 --> 03:00:26.373]  I'm going to play part of it for Millie Weaver.
[03:00:26.393 --> 03:00:27.695]  It's a good report.
[03:00:27.875 --> 03:00:32.361]  And then I haven't gotten into the rest of the big news.
[03:00:33.462 --> 03:00:41.108]  They're freaking out about the poll that the majority of Americans know that the deep state is operating and is criminal, so they don't know how to deal with that.
[03:00:41.729 --> 03:00:47.413]  A bunch of other news I'm going to get into dealing with Trump announcing a meeting with Putin, finally, and more.
[03:00:47.433 --> 03:00:50.376]  And I've got a challenge, too, for David Hogg.
[03:00:51.216 --> 03:00:52.998]  He's challenged to debate me and then backed out.
[03:00:53.018 --> 03:00:54.599]  I've got a challenge for him coming up.
[03:00:55.059 --> 03:00:58.182]  But here is part of that report from Millie Weaver.
[03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:03.406]  We're good.
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:18.743]  Today at South by Southwest around 1230 p.m.
[03:01:18.763 --> 03:01:23.807]  there's going to be a Handmaid's Tale panel called What If Roe Had to Go.
[03:01:23.927 --> 03:01:38.599]  Essentially, what happens if no longer there are abortion rights laws that can allow these women who want to have multiple abortions for even up until full term to continue to have abortions.
[03:01:38.619 --> 03:01:41.662]  The Handmaid's Tale is essentially to make it so that
[03:01:42.162 --> 03:01:46.224]  Motherhood, having babies, is seen as a burden, it's seen as forced.
[03:01:46.725 --> 03:01:51.027]  These feminists believed what would happen if the laws were to come into action.
[03:01:51.147 --> 03:02:11.538]  The whole point of this right here, this show, this panel, this image right here for people to see when they're walking by, is to suggest and subliminally put it out there that there is a battle of the sexes and that essentially all men, all masculinity is bad, is oppressing women.
[03:02:11.698 --> 03:02:12.078]  Ed, pause.
[03:02:12.539 --> 03:02:13.360]  It's more than that too.
[03:02:13.380 --> 03:02:15.623]  The women wear burkas and full body outfits.
[03:02:16.104 --> 03:02:19.508]  So it's not Islam that's oppressing women, it's the West that empowered women.
[03:02:19.849 --> 03:02:21.951]  And then feminimity and children is a prison.
[03:02:21.971 --> 03:02:22.632]  So Millie's right.
[03:02:22.973 --> 03:02:24.635]  But it's all total inversion.
[03:02:24.855 --> 03:02:28.961]  But Hollywood, pedophile Hollywood, it's going to take good care of you and gang rape you real good.
[03:02:30.703 --> 03:02:34.285]  They don't want to talk about the women in the Middle East that are being oppressed.
[03:02:34.345 --> 03:02:41.429]  No, they'll help support the Muslim Middle East culture that wants to infringe on women's rights in the Middle East.
[03:02:41.949 --> 03:02:42.930]  I want to point out this right here.
[03:02:42.990 --> 03:02:44.070]  Resist, sister.
[03:02:44.090 --> 03:02:49.553]  Resist is a common, obviously it's used with a lot of Black Lives Matter.
[03:02:49.573 --> 03:02:50.594]  Hit pause again.
[03:02:50.614 --> 03:02:52.595]  I'm going to play the whole report when we come back.
[03:02:53.215 --> 03:02:54.936]  Because it's important and not an interrupter.
[03:02:58.004 --> 03:03:00.405]  Resist, sister, the big corporations in Hollywood.
[03:03:00.665 --> 03:03:01.845]  We care about you, sister.
[03:03:01.905 --> 03:03:02.785]  We care about you, ladies.
[03:03:03.085 --> 03:03:05.806]  This was all being produced like Hillary was going to be president.
[03:03:06.466 --> 03:03:12.968]  Handmaid's Tale was being produced in 2016 and then being cut and made and ready for 2018.
[03:03:14.568 --> 03:03:16.929]  Just like the new Homeland was a woman president.
[03:03:17.717 --> 03:03:21.742]  In 2016 into 18, and then it wasn't, so now it's another president.
[03:03:22.343 --> 03:03:29.091]  They just had it all lined up where you don't like Hillary, you don't like women, and then women are supposed to be real dumb and go, you're right.
[03:03:29.512 --> 03:03:31.674]  I didn't play this this week, it was one of the biggest stories.
[03:03:32.395 --> 03:03:36.921]  I'm gonna play Hillary in India about, you know, white women listening to their husbands.
[03:03:39.542 --> 03:03:43.364]  White women, the nine richest groups in the U.S.
[03:03:43.424 --> 03:03:46.046]  are all Asian if you rank them by quote race.
[03:03:46.786 --> 03:03:48.807]  Whites are way down there.
[03:03:49.908 --> 03:04:00.294]  But a woman that's with a husband that's successful or vice versa or both of them, wouldn't it be smart to go, my kids are doing well, I'm doing well, I've got a great life, my husband's smart.
[03:04:01.744 --> 03:04:02.324]  I like him.
[03:04:02.664 --> 03:04:03.264]  I like Trump.
[03:04:03.844 --> 03:04:04.444]  He likes Trump.
[03:04:05.265 --> 03:04:11.306]  The patronizing of that, I haven't even got into this because she makes me so sick, but I'm going to get into it now when we come back.
[03:04:11.926 --> 03:04:25.168]  The fact that Hillary says that women were made by men in the West to vote for Trump, like Western men, like I've got women chained up at home and I cut their genitals off.
[03:04:25.968 --> 03:04:29.569]  If anything, the women of my life are sitting on top of pink pillows.
[03:04:31.638 --> 03:04:33.399]  And it probably isn't even the best thing.
[03:04:34.900 --> 03:04:37.141]  But, that's it.
[03:04:37.601 --> 03:04:39.562]  It's what the West is, and I'm an extreme example of that.
[03:04:40.843 --> 03:04:49.367]  Now, if you want to be in a slave brothel with a hundred guys raping you until you die, or you want to be sold on a slave block onto a slave ship and taken to a brothel until you're raped to death, Islam's for you.
[03:04:50.148 --> 03:04:53.429]  But again, the left covers that up because they love the desecration of women.
[03:04:53.609 --> 03:04:54.490]  They hate women.
[03:04:58.525 --> 03:05:04.673]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have in Fuller's Life, it'd take hours.
[03:05:04.993 --> 03:05:11.442]  Michael's ZX Plus now has a lower price, it's stronger, it's the other equation in probiotics, it knocks out the yeast, the mold.
[03:05:12.483 --> 03:05:14.244]  The Candida, it's back in stock.
[03:05:14.564 --> 03:05:17.385]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:05:17.725 --> 03:05:21.086]  It's got the Preglanone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:05:21.506 --> 03:05:25.347]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.
[03:05:25.607 --> 03:05:34.630]  Our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[03:05:34.710 --> 03:05:36.491]  It's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[03:05:36.891 --> 03:05:38.752]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[03:05:39.612 --> 03:05:42.213]  Super high-quality silver and a lot more.
[03:05:42.233 --> 03:05:43.594]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:05:43.614 --> 03:05:53.218]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:05:53.559 --> 03:05:56.600]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:06:08.473 --> 03:06:12.624]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:06:13.326 --> 03:06:14.830]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.023 --> 03:06:37.286]  So Hillary came out, you know, she said earlier in the week or last week in India, in between falling down and breaking her arm and falling down three other times, but her health is just fine.
[03:06:38.106 --> 03:06:39.066]  She never falls down either.
[03:06:39.106 --> 03:06:40.326]  That's fake news from Alex Jones.
[03:06:40.767 --> 03:06:44.768]  CNN reports it was Alex Jones and Paul Watson put out the rumors she fell down.
[03:06:45.068 --> 03:06:47.668]  She only slipped, look, then they cut before she falls down.
[03:06:47.728 --> 03:06:49.769]  I mean, they are the kings of fake news.
[03:06:50.851 --> 03:06:55.453]  And then Hillary came out and said, white women voted how their husbands told them.
[03:06:55.933 --> 03:06:57.594]  We can put that article on screen for TV viewers.
[03:06:58.554 --> 03:07:00.195]  But that is the craziness.
[03:07:00.715 --> 03:07:06.057]  Like it or not, studies suggest that Clinton may not be wrong on white women voting like their husbands.
[03:07:06.677 --> 03:07:08.998]  See the lie from the Washington Post from Jeff Bezos?
[03:07:11.599 --> 03:07:14.220]  She said her husbands make them vote!
[03:07:14.961 --> 03:07:18.002]  Not that white women don't vote like their husbands!
[03:07:21.377 --> 03:07:22.157]  See the sleight of hand?
[03:07:22.698 --> 03:07:27.039]  Everything with these people is deception, preying on you, hoping you don't pay attention.
[03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:32.281]  Hillary Clinton blames pressure from men for why white women voted for Trump.
[03:07:37.263 --> 03:07:39.404]  So, that's where all this is going.
[03:07:40.844 --> 03:07:42.345]  And then they show Handmaiden's Tale.
[03:07:43.988 --> 03:07:47.311]  And they've got all these big PR stunts for being a mother, having a baby.
[03:07:47.351 --> 03:07:48.271]  That's all Gloria Steinem.
[03:07:48.532 --> 03:07:49.713]  Gloria Steinem had a bunch of kids.
[03:07:49.733 --> 03:07:51.554]  She worked for the leftist CIA, by the way.
[03:07:51.854 --> 03:07:52.355]  She admits that.
[03:07:52.675 --> 03:07:56.838]  To get women into the workforce, to break up the family, so the state could raise them.
[03:07:58.179 --> 03:07:59.701]  So, that's what we're talking about here.
[03:07:59.741 --> 03:08:05.465]  Hillary Clinton blames pressure from men for why white women vote for Trump.
[03:08:05.485 --> 03:08:06.586]  What a racist statement.
[03:08:07.987 --> 03:08:08.668]  And here's the clip.
[03:08:09.585 --> 03:08:26.779]  Well, I should start by explaining that Democrats, going back to my husband even before, but just in recent times, going back to Bill and our candidates and then President Obama, have been losing the white vote, including white women.
[03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:33.904]  We do not do well with white men, and we don't do well with married white women.
[03:08:35.822 --> 03:08:52.675]  And part of that is an identification with the Republican Party and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss,
[03:08:53.816 --> 03:08:57.239]  Your son, whoever, believes you should.
[03:08:57.539 --> 03:09:13.911]  And what happened in my election is I was on the way to winning white women until former director of the FBI, Jim Comey, dropped that very ill-advised letter on October the 28th.
[03:09:13.951 --> 03:09:15.292]  And my numbers just went down.
[03:09:15.432 --> 03:09:18.154]  And I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence about those people.
[03:09:21.041 --> 03:09:23.942]  She's over in India trying to preach racism against white people.
[03:09:23.962 --> 03:09:25.082]  I mean, that's the backdrop.
[03:09:25.102 --> 03:09:26.562]  The whites are just too stupid.
[03:09:28.203 --> 03:09:32.244]  In India, one of the most racist places in the world, where they worship white people.
[03:09:33.504 --> 03:09:34.184]  In the caste system.
[03:09:34.324 --> 03:09:35.165]  And I don't think that's a good thing.
[03:09:35.945 --> 03:09:37.705]  But you go to India, the ruling class is white.
[03:09:39.766 --> 03:09:41.266]  I mean, I'm gonna throw up, man.
[03:09:41.306 --> 03:09:43.107]  I can't handle this crap anymore.
[03:09:43.127 --> 03:09:46.988]  I mean, you've got this monster Hillary Clinton.
[03:09:47.912 --> 03:09:52.376]  That if they'd have run a smart, patriotic woman, she would have beaten Trump.
[03:09:53.737 --> 03:09:57.860]  But despite all of it, they force-fed us this monster of corruption.
[03:10:02.404 --> 03:10:04.626]  Let's go to Millie's Handmaid's Tale from the start.
[03:10:05.367 --> 03:10:06.287]  This is her breakdown.
[03:10:06.548 --> 03:10:06.868]  Here it is.
[03:10:12.090 --> 03:10:15.751]  Today at South by Southwest around 1230 p.m.
[03:10:15.771 --> 03:10:20.813]  there's going to be a Handmaid's Tale panel called What If Roe Had to Go?
[03:10:20.933 --> 03:10:35.618]  Essentially, what happens if no longer there are abortion rights laws that can allow these women who want to have multiple abortions for even up until full term to continue to have abortions.
[03:10:35.658 --> 03:10:38.679]  The Handmaid's Tale is essentially to make it so that
[03:10:39.199 --> 03:10:43.242]  Motherhood, having babies, is seen as a burden, it's seen as forced.
[03:10:43.742 --> 03:10:48.065]  These feminists believed what would happen if the laws were to come into action.
[03:10:48.185 --> 03:10:57.972]  The whole point of this right here, this show, this panel, this image right here for people to see when they're walking by, is to suggest
[03:10:58.052 --> 03:11:12.701]  They just insubliminally put it out there that there is a battle of the sexes and that essentially all men, all masculinity is bad, is oppressing women, but they don't want to talk about the women in the Middle East that are being oppressed.
[03:11:12.901 --> 03:11:19.926]  No, they'll help support the Muslim Middle East culture that wants to infringe on women's rights in the Middle East.
[03:11:20.366 --> 03:11:21.447]  I want to point out this right here.
[03:11:21.507 --> 03:11:22.587]  Resist, sister.
[03:11:22.607 --> 03:11:24.308]  Resist is a common
[03:11:25.689 --> 03:11:28.731]  Obviously it's used with a lot of Black Lives Matter and Tifa.
[03:11:29.032 --> 03:11:32.214]  This is a call to resist Trump to women.
[03:11:32.674 --> 03:11:50.388]  This is a call for feminists and women to come together because, see, they're trying to let all the women know that, hey, these men are trying to oppress you and force you to have babies and force you to, you know, because that's what this whole show is about, is about women that are in a dystopic future and they're forced to have babies.
[03:11:50.468 --> 03:11:51.008]  And pause again.
[03:11:52.489 --> 03:11:54.890]  And in truth, the globalists just want you as their slaves.
[03:11:55.491 --> 03:11:57.152]  They don't want you totally isolated.
[03:11:57.272 --> 03:11:57.672]  Continue.
[03:11:58.613 --> 03:12:01.714]  Ultra-conservative patriarchy.
[03:12:01.895 --> 03:12:10.399]  It's almost as if they're saying that motherhood isn't powerful enough, and that in a sense that by being a mother, by being a wife, you're essentially being a slave.
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:16.823]  When what they don't talk about is how women are actually being manipulated by the abortion systems every single day.
[03:12:17.063 --> 03:12:21.586]  The abortion systems, what they'll do is they'll take in a woman, and they will hit her at the most vulnerable spots.
[03:12:21.966 --> 03:12:24.287]  You know, they'll make her feel as if she's not good enough to be a mother.
[03:12:24.367 --> 03:12:28.728]  She's not fit enough for anything that she wants to do that she can't handle in the world unless she gets an abortion.
[03:12:29.668 --> 03:12:30.789]  Exactly, that's what they do.
[03:12:30.849 --> 03:12:32.649]  They don't offer a real choice.
[03:12:32.789 --> 03:12:36.250]  Usually when you go to an abortion clinic, they don't give you a choice.
[03:12:36.310 --> 03:12:43.112]  They don't say, hey, we're going to help you with your female gynecological issues.
[03:12:43.232 --> 03:12:48.174]  If you want to go in and you want to get ultrasounds, if you need maternity care, they don't offer maternity care.
[03:12:48.194 --> 03:12:51.475]  They don't tell you there's people willing to pay for the baby legally, hundreds of thousands.
[03:12:51.875 --> 03:12:53.496]  Are they just for pro-abortion?
[03:12:54.957 --> 03:13:00.180]  Okay, so notice here you have a sign that says concealed handguns prohibited.
[03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:05.463]  You also have openly carried handguns being prohibited as well.
[03:13:05.923 --> 03:13:13.428]  And this is a little fenced-in area which inside is the venue for bulletproof a coffee and
[03:13:13.848 --> 03:13:14.288]  I think so.
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:36.441]  Uh, free of guns, free of the Second Amendment.
[03:13:36.781 --> 03:13:50.523]  Do you really think that if you had a coffee maker that was, you know, say, to have a name that was pro-Second Amendment, for example, do you think that they would be permitted to have a venue here at South by Southwest?
[03:13:50.904 --> 03:14:02.726]  Well, I highly doubt it because pretty much all of the venues and everything that we've been seeing here at South by Southwest has a very extreme liberal bias in everything they do.
[03:14:04.517 --> 03:14:05.938]  Oh yeah, it's like Bubble Boy.
[03:14:05.958 --> 03:14:09.381]  Or like, almost like a hamster wheel, or a hamster ball, I'm sorry.
[03:14:09.401 --> 03:14:10.001]  That's crazy.
[03:14:10.041 --> 03:14:12.102]  Keeping us going in the same pace, same time.
[03:14:12.122 --> 03:14:14.584]  That's like in the Prisoner, the big bubbles that chase you down.
[03:14:14.744 --> 03:14:17.706]  Saying that this technology is going to keep us on the hamster wheel, if you will.
[03:14:19.047 --> 03:14:22.750]  By the way, we always create different flags for our events because the left will beat even women up.
[03:14:24.311 --> 03:14:25.972]  So you can't go out in these areas.
[03:14:25.992 --> 03:14:26.633]  What car to go?
[03:14:27.447 --> 03:14:31.935]  It's all membership based and you just use your app to unlock the car and drive.
[03:14:32.296 --> 03:14:34.299]  And you can park anywhere you want within the home area.
[03:14:35.973 --> 03:14:36.553]  That's interesting.
[03:14:36.593 --> 03:14:47.201]  So essentially, it kind of is like a rental car, but instead you subscribe to a membership where you can use any different car.
[03:14:47.221 --> 03:14:50.463]  You don't get charged extra for different cars and you have a monthly rate.
[03:14:50.523 --> 03:14:51.103]  Is that what it is?
[03:14:51.704 --> 03:14:52.304]  No monthly rate.
[03:14:52.404 --> 03:14:53.525]  It's just per use.
[03:14:53.545 --> 03:14:54.525]  You only get charged for what you use.
[03:14:54.866 --> 03:14:57.067]  So are these cars just going to be parked around cities?
[03:14:57.487 --> 03:14:58.408]  That you can just hop into?
[03:14:58.448 --> 03:14:59.609]  Kind of how those bicycles are?
[03:14:59.629 --> 03:15:00.710]  Yep, exactly.
[03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:03.451]  They get preferential treatment and they're allowed to park, but you aren't.
[03:15:06.193 --> 03:15:11.157]  I mean, what do you guys think about how this is kind of like phasing out car ownership in a way?
[03:15:11.237 --> 03:15:14.319]  Like, if everyone just starts doing this, people aren't going to be owning cars anymore.
[03:15:14.339 --> 03:15:16.200]  That's the point.
[03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:17.441]  That's the point?
[03:15:17.461 --> 03:15:18.081]  That's the point.
[03:15:18.281 --> 03:15:20.103]  That's all about markets where you don't have choice.
[03:15:20.748 --> 03:15:24.611]  So we think there's more benefit of people sharing cars, not having cars just sitting in the traffic.
[03:15:24.631 --> 03:15:25.651]  They think it's more benefit.
[03:15:25.692 --> 03:15:27.713]  Not being used for 90% of the day.
[03:15:28.173 --> 03:15:29.774]  Yeah, car to go is a complete joke.
[03:15:30.035 --> 03:15:31.756]  Alright, that report's very diverse.
[03:15:31.816 --> 03:15:33.137]  It's in a whole bunch of different subjects.
[03:15:33.617 --> 03:15:37.060]  I don't mean diverse in the LibTard version, but a lot of different angles.
[03:15:37.540 --> 03:15:40.242]  You can see the full report at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:15:40.622 --> 03:15:41.403]  When we return...
[03:15:42.876 --> 03:15:47.463]  The Morning Joe flips out that America's waking up to the deep state.
[03:15:47.964 --> 03:15:49.546]  All that and more straight ahead.
[03:15:49.566 --> 03:15:51.790]  This is The Infowar.
[03:15:56.425 --> 03:16:05.872]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[03:16:06.473 --> 03:16:11.116]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[03:16:11.777 --> 03:16:23.126]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[03:16:24.011 --> 03:16:37.399]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[03:16:38.199 --> 03:16:43.362]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[03:16:43.823 --> 03:16:45.264]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[03:16:46.124 --> 03:16:46.965]  A lot of protein.
[03:16:47.486 --> 03:16:48.427]  You don't chew it properly.
[03:16:48.467 --> 03:16:49.528]  Sometimes there's buildup.
[03:16:49.548 --> 03:16:53.213]  You can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis.
[03:16:53.393 --> 03:16:53.914]  You name it.
[03:16:54.494 --> 03:16:56.857]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[03:16:57.932 --> 03:17:05.416]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[03:17:05.936 --> 03:17:17.903]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[03:17:18.223 --> 03:17:20.765]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[03:17:21.385 --> 03:17:25.389]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[03:17:25.789 --> 03:17:27.631]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[03:17:28.072 --> 03:17:41.945]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[03:17:42.145 --> 03:17:45.949]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[03:17:46.289 --> 03:17:48.370]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[03:17:48.731 --> 03:17:53.554]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[03:17:53.874 --> 03:17:56.756]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[03:17:57.196 --> 03:17:58.977]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:17:59.477 --> 03:18:09.784]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[03:18:10.904 --> 03:18:13.106]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[03:18:14.227 --> 03:18:27.034]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[03:18:27.634 --> 03:18:36.819]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[03:18:38.348 --> 03:18:40.069]  This is the total win-win.
[03:18:40.589 --> 03:18:46.293]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[03:18:46.853 --> 03:18:51.276]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[03:18:51.596 --> 03:18:55.679]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best
[03:18:56.119 --> 03:18:57.120]  At the lowest price.
[03:18:57.600 --> 03:19:07.025]  Many probiotics out there don't even have caplets that bypass the stomach so it never even gets into the upper and lower intestines.
[03:19:07.585 --> 03:19:14.389]  Both of these systems have targeted delivery so it goes right through into the upper and lower intestine.
[03:19:15.249 --> 03:19:22.815]  We've tried several other formulas that were excellent, but this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[03:19:23.175 --> 03:19:28.860]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[03:19:29.340 --> 03:19:34.004]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[03:19:34.604 --> 03:19:43.652]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[03:19:44.730 --> 03:19:48.455]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[03:19:48.635 --> 03:19:56.484]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:20:00.489 --> 03:20:03.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.303 --> 03:20:25.884]  Well folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[03:20:27.365 --> 03:20:29.066]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:20:30.587 --> 03:20:31.647]  And we are here.
[03:20:32.388 --> 03:20:33.388]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:40.712]  Reddit user says he's Austin bombing killer.
[03:20:41.833 --> 03:20:42.873]  And it's probably made up.
[03:20:43.914 --> 03:20:44.754]  Probably not the killer.
[03:20:45.335 --> 03:20:48.376]  But this person says they were planning to bomb us today.
[03:20:49.697 --> 03:20:50.617]  Shipping the package.
[03:20:51.857 --> 03:21:01.044]  From San Antonio to our offices, and that it must have detonated or had the switch thrown by being bounced.
[03:21:01.664 --> 03:21:03.685]  And from the police, these are pressure bombs.
[03:21:04.846 --> 03:21:06.768]  But we've already reported that, so this individual could know that.
[03:21:06.808 --> 03:21:07.168]  Who knows?
[03:21:07.668 --> 03:21:14.213]  I would not report it, except that it's been picked up by the New York Daily News.
[03:21:14.613 --> 03:21:17.455]  So document Kim's shot, please, for TV viewers.
[03:21:19.156 --> 03:21:19.957]  And you can see here.
[03:21:22.622 --> 03:21:23.943]  Where they get into all that.
[03:21:25.284 --> 03:21:27.066]  So this is just all part of the hysteria.
[03:21:28.347 --> 03:21:33.491]  It's just like folks think they're going to win some Powerball ticket where people bought 20 million tickets.
[03:21:34.992 --> 03:21:36.474]  Or 100 million tickets in some cases.
[03:21:37.434 --> 03:21:40.097]  And then everybody just thinks when those balls start rolling they can get it.
[03:21:40.157 --> 03:21:48.664]  Statistically, you could have the German Air Force flying over here with a bunch of German bombers and dropping thousands and thousands of pounds of bombs.
[03:21:49.963 --> 03:21:53.305]  Tens of thousands of pounds of bombs, and it would still only kill a fraction of the city.
[03:21:54.066 --> 03:21:58.049]  You got more people dying every week in car wrecks in Austin than, you know, or dying in a month from these bombings.
[03:21:58.369 --> 03:21:59.210]  But it's still serious.
[03:21:59.250 --> 03:22:02.352]  I'm not taking away from that if it blows your head off or blows your arms off.
[03:22:02.392 --> 03:22:05.394]  It's just, it creates this lottery ticket idea.
[03:22:06.775 --> 03:22:07.616]  But in a negative way.
[03:22:07.636 --> 03:22:10.398]  Like, you think because you own a ticket, it's probably going to be you.
[03:22:12.059 --> 03:22:14.401]  Even though it's, it's, the odds are incredibly
[03:22:16.846 --> 03:22:17.266]  Huge.
[03:22:17.767 --> 03:22:18.948]  You still have that perception.
[03:22:19.449 --> 03:22:26.716]  Just like great white sharks kill six, seven, eight people a year on average, people still tell you, I don't like to swim in the deep ocean or I don't like to go offshore.
[03:22:27.096 --> 03:22:29.358]  I'm afraid a great white's going to eat me because of the movie Jaws.
[03:22:29.819 --> 03:22:36.946]  And for years after that movie came out in 1972, in California and New England and other areas, they saw
[03:22:38.314 --> 03:22:48.582]  Up to 50% reductions in people getting beach houses and going out in the water and people going out and fishing because they just thought there were great whites out there to eat them.
[03:22:49.262 --> 03:22:50.984]  Even though it's one of the rarest ways to die.
[03:22:51.864 --> 03:22:54.867]  So, this has created hysteria.
[03:22:56.148 --> 03:22:58.470]  It's what terrorism does.
[03:22:59.949 --> 03:23:12.552]  It's what it's designed to do, and generally it's a mental patient type, schizophrenic type, that has an education, or it's somebody that wants to get attention, usually a leftist.
[03:23:12.772 --> 03:23:13.732]  That's what most of these people are.
[03:23:13.772 --> 03:23:16.013]  Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, you name it.
[03:23:16.753 --> 03:23:20.674]  Paul Watson gets in an article pointing out that Netflix has a hit show.
[03:23:21.761 --> 03:23:22.282]  I don't think so.
[03:23:40.737 --> 03:23:51.873]  But, if you do think it's Kaczynski, related, as an ode to Kaczynski, as a love letter, as a copycat, then you gotta bring in the CIA, because Theodore Kaczynski...
[03:23:55.327 --> 03:24:00.949]  Volunteered for the CIA in college, and disappeared into the MKUltra project.
[03:24:01.209 --> 03:24:01.809]  That's on record!
[03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:04.390]  LA Times Associated Press.
[03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:09.311]  And so, we're not saying that's the CIA.
[03:24:09.911 --> 03:24:12.212]  We're not saying it's leftists that are doing it.
[03:24:12.692 --> 03:24:23.175]  We're saying, historically, unless you're talking about islamicists, it's the same category, cowards, it's the left that do most of the bombings.
[03:24:24.264 --> 03:24:25.484]  You can say, well, look what McVeigh did.
[03:24:25.564 --> 03:24:28.325]  Well, I know the names of the feds that carried out the bombing.
[03:24:28.365 --> 03:24:30.586]  I know the names of all the people involved.
[03:24:30.626 --> 03:24:32.007]  It came out in court documents.
[03:24:32.727 --> 03:24:39.249]  I've talked to the cop of the year's family and everybody that was tortured to death because he saw who did it wasn't McVeigh.
[03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:45.292]  But look at the Weathermen underground and all the communist groups and Patty Hearst and on and on and on.
[03:24:45.852 --> 03:24:46.732]  It's what communists do.
[03:24:46.772 --> 03:24:47.512]  It's what cowards do.
[03:24:49.253 --> 03:24:51.274]  So I'm not saying that she's done this.
[03:24:52.441 --> 03:24:55.142]  I'm saying we have a historical fact from what we've seen in the past.
[03:24:55.502 --> 03:25:19.031]  Now, the fact that we even have something called a deep state, that just means the bureaucracies, the entrenched, unelected bureaucracy, and that interfaces with the shadow government, which was set up legitimately for continuity of government during nuclear war, asteroid strikes, or other systems that knock out a legitimate elected government,
[03:25:20.731 --> 03:25:25.917]  You then have a COG that is the shadow government.
[03:25:25.957 --> 03:25:29.241]  That's the term used in parlance for 50 years.
[03:25:30.042 --> 03:25:38.012]  That then interfaces with the bureaucracy and the leftist arms of the deep state, which is pretty much the entire deep state is leftist, about 80%.
[03:25:40.535 --> 03:25:47.242]  They're now lashing out at America, lashing out at Christians, lashing out at Trump, lashing out at prosperity, not because they're communists.
[03:25:47.562 --> 03:25:54.969]  They want the average person to be a slave on a chicken feed diet enough to just barely let them survive so they can play God.
[03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:59.494]  It's a very beta group of cowardly scum.
[03:26:01.263 --> 03:26:17.664]  Directed by a very small, cloistered group of billionaires and elites that want a monopoly system so they can have delusions of grandeur and have a breakaway civilization, livestock technologies, and of course, do what Pinky and the Brain always talks about, the same thing they always talk about, ruling the world.
[03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:20.082]  So that's how this works.
[03:26:20.562 --> 03:26:25.708]  That's the real system, and they hate me, because they sit around and they go, nobody ever listens to that guy.
[03:26:25.728 --> 03:26:28.591]  He doesn't have a foppish NPR accent.
[03:26:29.352 --> 03:26:30.153]  Boom, they start listening.
[03:26:31.014 --> 03:26:31.955]  Well, what do we do?
[03:26:33.357 --> 03:26:35.660]  Because if they keep listening to him, it's all over.
[03:26:36.661 --> 03:26:38.243]  So here's the Morning Joe.
[03:26:40.350 --> 03:26:45.293]  Flipping out that people are learning about the deep state.
[03:26:45.553 --> 03:26:49.415]  They sound the alarm that people think there's a deep state.
[03:26:49.875 --> 03:26:54.257]  And they think the sun comes up and they think blood once it's oxygenated is red.
[03:26:54.277 --> 03:26:55.258]  Here it is.
[03:26:57.952 --> 03:26:58.072]  Yeah.
[03:27:20.549 --> 03:27:26.833]  That unelected or appointed government officials have too much influence in determining federal policy.
[03:27:26.853 --> 03:27:36.478]  26% say the right balance of power exists between elected and unelected officials, while this view of the deep state looks to be growing more prevalent.
[03:27:36.958 --> 03:27:45.683]  Only 13% of Americans are very familiar with the term, 24% are somewhat familiar, and 63% said they are not familiar.
[03:27:45.783 --> 03:27:48.625]  However, when Monmouth described the term,
[03:27:48.925 --> 03:28:01.653]  As, quote, a group of unelected government and military officials who secretly manipulate or direct national policy, nearly three in four Americans said they believe that the deep state exists.
[03:28:02.313 --> 03:28:04.575]  One in five said it does not.
[03:28:04.795 --> 03:28:07.977]  And I think of the Facebook story and Cambridge Analytics that we're covering.
[03:28:08.017 --> 03:28:10.238]  We'll be doing a lot more on that later.
[03:28:10.278 --> 03:28:13.641]  But Carol Lee, this is real.
[03:28:14.121 --> 03:28:17.223]  And this president may be on to something, whether it's right or wrong.
[03:28:17.603 --> 03:28:29.427]  This is, I can't, I don't think you can look at that any other way than that it's a direct result of what we've seen the president try to do, which is sow doubt about people in the administration, whether it's the FBI.
[03:28:29.447 --> 03:28:30.947]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[03:28:31.227 --> 03:28:33.368]  Look, everybody knows there's dug-in bureaucracies.
[03:28:33.788 --> 03:28:36.749]  You got Schumer on TV going, the bureaucracy will take the president out.
[03:28:37.029 --> 03:28:38.470]  You got Mudd saying it's going to kill him.
[03:28:39.610 --> 03:28:41.151]  You better, threatening everybody.
[03:28:41.171 --> 03:28:43.351]  You idiots can't have it both ways.
[03:28:43.451 --> 03:28:44.852]  You've declared a war on America.
[03:28:45.532 --> 03:28:47.873]  And now America has declared war on you.
[03:28:48.653 --> 03:28:50.113]  So, let's go!
[03:28:50.273 --> 03:28:50.953]  Let's bang heads!
[03:28:51.554 --> 03:28:52.074]  Let's do it!
[03:28:52.454 --> 03:28:52.854]  You want it?
[03:28:53.194 --> 03:28:53.614]  We're coming!
[03:28:53.934 --> 03:28:54.834]  Nothing's gonna stop us now!
[03:28:56.455 --> 03:28:57.855]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:28:58.095 --> 03:28:59.396]  You can't survive without it.
[03:28:59.576 --> 03:29:00.516]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:00.796 --> 03:29:06.557]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:06.777 --> 03:29:12.499]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:12.679 --> 03:29:29.550]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:29.930 --> 03:29:32.072]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:32.432 --> 03:29:33.633]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:33.894 --> 03:29:34.654]  Easy assembly.
[03:29:34.935 --> 03:29:35.555]  Low maintenance.
[03:29:35.855 --> 03:29:37.657]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:29:55.913 --> 03:30:00.335]  The hysteria and the dishonesty about firearms is staggering.
[03:30:00.595 --> 03:30:06.297]  And if you want to save children's lives, which all conscientious, caring people want to do, you don't go after lies.
[03:30:06.537 --> 03:30:10.138]  You go after reality and science and ballistic knowledge.
[03:30:10.559 --> 03:30:11.879]  None of them seem to have that.
[03:30:13.840 --> 03:30:14.940]  Here goes a couple shots.
[03:30:30.506 --> 03:30:30.966]  Really a lot of power.
[03:30:31.006 --> 03:30:32.647]  Man, that son of a bitch.
[03:30:32.667 --> 03:30:33.427]  Really a lot of power.
[03:30:33.447 --> 03:30:34.448]  It's a boost gun for the gun niche.
[03:30:34.468 --> 03:30:35.408]  Fire in the hole, you clear?
[03:31:01.949 --> 03:31:10.233]  Well, on my Facebook every day, I salute entrepreneurs across this country that sacrifice and take risks to start business and employ people and be in the asset column.
[03:31:10.614 --> 03:31:12.295]  And the Nugent family has always stood by that.
[03:31:12.335 --> 03:31:14.236]  We've always worked and earned our own way.
[03:31:14.796 --> 03:31:19.638]  And when you stand up for the Second Amendment, all of a sudden you have Ammo with your name on it.
[03:31:19.858 --> 03:31:22.620]  And I have Gold Tip Arrows with my signature.
[03:31:22.940 --> 03:31:24.881]  And I have my Nuge Java.
[03:31:24.901 --> 03:31:28.783]  But bottom line is, working hard, playing hard America is alive and well.
[03:31:28.883 --> 03:31:30.224]  And I'm just proud to be one of them.
[03:31:30.484 --> 03:31:31.785]  Shemaine and I get up early every day.
[03:31:31.845 --> 03:31:33.005]  We work really hard every day.
[03:31:33.426 --> 03:31:35.967]  And then we snuggle at night and get ready to start over tomorrow.
[03:31:36.267 --> 03:31:43.111]  So I'm just here to salute people who really earn their position in the asset column of America.
[03:31:43.291 --> 03:31:45.192]  And when you see my audiences at the concert,
[03:31:46.673 --> 03:31:47.793]  It has a life of its own.
[03:31:47.833 --> 03:31:50.935]  It's literally a firestorm of ferocity.
[03:31:51.295 --> 03:31:57.038]  My music and my band and my audiences love real American soul music and rock and roll music and rhythm and blues.
[03:31:57.418 --> 03:32:03.341]  And this is, it's 2018 and this is the best year of my life in spite of the crazy world around us.
[03:32:03.421 --> 03:32:14.867]  And I think, to some degree, because of the crazy world around us, you see dishonesty and ignorance and hate and rot and evil and nastiness from the left.
[03:32:15.407 --> 03:32:18.389]  And it makes you really confident that you're doing good.
[03:32:19.250 --> 03:32:23.553]  There's a colloquialism, a battle cry that I always end up with.
[03:32:24.794 --> 03:32:28.457]  Sometimes you give the world the best you got and you get kicked in the teeth.
[03:32:29.418 --> 03:32:31.079]  Give the world the best you got anyway.
[03:32:32.941 --> 03:32:37.304]  Coming to the InfoWars, Ted Nugent's The Music Made Me Do It.
[03:32:37.804 --> 03:32:40.427]  Exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:00.353 --> 03:33:02.955]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:21.061 --> 03:33:27.125]  You know, I was just looking at DrugsReport.com
[03:33:40.586 --> 03:33:43.088]  And I was looking at just how crazy all the headlines are.
[03:33:43.629 --> 03:33:46.511]  Not from a sensationalist perspective, just because that's what's happening in the news.
[03:33:47.071 --> 03:33:48.953]  Austin gripped by fifth bombing.
[03:33:49.553 --> 03:33:53.717]  Experts look at it being a Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski copycat.
[03:33:55.198 --> 03:34:00.142]  And then right next to it, man faces year in prison for Hitler dog joke.
[03:34:04.005 --> 03:34:06.387]  And then what's even weirder is both articles are ours.
[03:34:07.408 --> 03:34:08.389]  And both articles are true.
[03:34:11.437 --> 03:34:12.718]  And it's all unfolding.
[03:34:12.858 --> 03:34:13.339]  It's crazy.
[03:34:14.981 --> 03:34:28.313]  Meanwhile, on the Hill, McCain rips Trump for congratulating Putin on his election as an insult to the Russian people.
[03:34:29.194 --> 03:34:32.798]  And that's the only reason I covered this thing earlier, the whole Politburo and the rest of it.
[03:34:32.838 --> 03:34:33.679]  Let me just do that now.
[03:34:36.024 --> 03:34:41.066]  No, let me do it next segment, because I had a bunch of guests on, and now I can't find my stack of Politburo news.
[03:34:41.146 --> 03:34:47.368]  I want to show Russia's electoral system versus China's, and just point out that that's not the case.
[03:34:48.669 --> 03:34:49.769]  Russia is not a dictatorship.
[03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:51.730]  And that's just because it's a fact.
[03:34:54.751 --> 03:34:57.612]  China is, and then our media won't call it a dictatorship.
[03:34:58.933 --> 03:34:59.953]  And it gives me a headache.
[03:35:03.434 --> 03:35:04.675]  You know what else gives me a headache?
[03:35:10.106 --> 03:35:12.107]  Constantly not being able to find my video list.
[03:35:12.147 --> 03:35:13.428]  Can you guys bring me another video list in here?
[03:35:14.009 --> 03:35:17.651]  Because I want to go over the videos and I was just digging through stuff and can't find it.
[03:35:17.671 --> 03:35:18.352]  Just bring me a video list.
[03:35:18.372 --> 03:35:18.632]  Thank you.
[03:35:20.193 --> 03:35:21.574]  I'll tell you what else gives me a headache.
[03:35:23.995 --> 03:35:28.698]  That's people that continue to say we need free health care.
[03:35:28.738 --> 03:35:29.019]  Thank you.
[03:35:29.519 --> 03:35:33.762]  We need free health care just like they got in England or in Cuba.
[03:35:34.762 --> 03:35:35.623]  It works perfectly.
[03:35:38.165 --> 03:35:39.546]  So I can get my plastic surgery.
[03:35:40.618 --> 03:35:46.823]  Only thing you get free in England is a sex change, because they want your weenie cut off, because they don't want to have you having any kids.
[03:35:47.644 --> 03:35:48.064]  Seriously.
[03:35:52.968 --> 03:35:57.933]  I mean, Paul Watson had a cold for like two months, was about to die, and they wouldn't even let him get antibiotics.
[03:35:58.871 --> 03:36:01.874]  Can he get permission to go to a private doctor from the National Health Service?
[03:36:02.535 --> 03:36:03.355]  He has the money.
[03:36:03.375 --> 03:36:04.416]  They have a two-tiered system.
[03:36:04.957 --> 03:36:06.759]  How am I even going to get into it?
[03:36:07.019 --> 03:36:09.882]  It's like, look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at North Korea.
[03:36:09.922 --> 03:36:11.123]  Good Lord!
[03:36:11.764 --> 03:36:14.586]  You know Canadians come here to have their surgeries, right?
[03:36:16.028 --> 03:36:21.253]  And that doesn't mean we are perfect people.
[03:36:24.141 --> 03:36:26.762]  But compared, our system's incredible.
[03:36:26.822 --> 03:36:27.402]  I know all about it.
[03:36:27.442 --> 03:36:29.023]  My dad's been in medical management my whole life.
[03:36:29.383 --> 03:36:31.504]  By the way, a lot of the crew just Googles what I say.
[03:36:32.504 --> 03:36:33.644]  As they find out, I'm telling them the truth.
[03:36:33.724 --> 03:36:34.305]  It sounds crazy.
[03:36:34.645 --> 03:36:35.525]  Put that back up, please.
[03:36:35.785 --> 03:36:36.805]  Good job finding that so quick.
[03:36:37.726 --> 03:36:40.027]  A lot of states won't pay for a sex change.
[03:36:40.747 --> 03:36:43.208]  And that's not because I don't want to hurt your feelings.
[03:36:43.228 --> 03:36:45.248]  You want to cut your arm off.
[03:36:45.488 --> 03:36:47.749]  You know, use a meat cleaver.
[03:36:47.809 --> 03:36:49.150]  I shouldn't have to pay for your medical bills.
[03:36:49.630 --> 03:36:50.130]  Same thing.
[03:36:50.190 --> 03:36:52.411]  You want to go have your genitals turned inside out?
[03:36:53.635 --> 03:36:58.576]  And all the rest of it, and say you're a purple, one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater, or whatever you want to be.
[03:36:59.397 --> 03:37:00.117]  That's your life.
[03:37:00.197 --> 03:37:00.797]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:37:01.297 --> 03:37:02.017]  Yeah, but there's the headline.
[03:37:02.498 --> 03:37:04.618]  So people that can't get free sex changes here?
[03:37:06.579 --> 03:37:07.339]  Well, where do they go?
[03:37:07.619 --> 03:37:08.439]  They go to the UK.
[03:37:09.039 --> 03:37:11.000]  Now, how discriminatory is that?
[03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:15.980]  How discriminatory is that?
[03:37:16.400 --> 03:37:23.722]  Transgender American woman, 25, who cannot afford gender reassignment surgery, is in the U.S., moving to the U.K.
[03:37:23.742 --> 03:37:24.502]  for a free operation.
[03:37:25.082 --> 03:37:37.165]  Because it's a man that says it's a woman's, they even put that up there, and then they go further, you can't afford it, well don't worry, Tavistock Institute that launched this whole Brave New World, it's gonna happen.
[03:37:39.725 --> 03:37:42.746]  Now imagine, and I've watched C-SPAN where they have
[03:37:44.056 --> 03:37:53.568]  Prime Minister's questions on the Parliament, and I remember watching Tony Blair, and I remember watching John Major, and I remember watching all these guys get up there.
[03:37:55.484 --> 03:38:03.946]  And they would, they would say, in this area of Suffolk's, young Billy Johnson waited two years for brain surgery and by then he died.
[03:38:04.326 --> 03:38:08.307]  The surgery was 98% operable in the first six months, but he waited.
[03:38:08.967 --> 03:38:11.488]  And then the prime minister would go, I understand what you're saying.
[03:38:11.728 --> 03:38:12.468]  Yes, it's too long.
[03:38:12.668 --> 03:38:13.388]  We need more funding.
[03:38:13.428 --> 03:38:15.248]  And then someone else would get up.
[03:38:15.368 --> 03:38:17.149]  I mean, these are real cases by the thousands.
[03:38:17.169 --> 03:38:19.829]  So I'm going to explain this to you.
[03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:21.510]  You are a
[03:38:23.101 --> 03:38:32.945]  Six-year-old little boy with an operable brain tumor that they could snip off if it doesn't grow too much bigger and you are going to get put six feet in the ground, Jack.
[03:38:35.786 --> 03:38:45.849]  But if you want to go over there and have some abusive whack job doctor take taxpayer money and chop somebody's genitals.
[03:38:45.869 --> 03:38:46.850]  That's what the left loves it.
[03:38:47.350 --> 03:38:49.651]  Islam's cutting women's genitals off.
[03:38:51.847 --> 03:38:55.030]  It's like demon world, man.
[03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:57.112]  It's demon world.
[03:38:57.713 --> 03:38:59.315]  Mutilate yourself, we'll pay for it.
[03:38:59.895 --> 03:39:08.444]  And then if I say you're mutilating yourself, I bet you terminally old boy, denied potentially life-saving treatment by NHS, would be given it in any US hospital.
[03:39:08.464 --> 03:39:09.205]  But let's stop there.
[03:39:11.098 --> 03:39:15.202]  I'm just sick of hearing about how great it is.
[03:39:16.083 --> 03:39:23.731]  I remember sitting there in college, I went two years, and it was the most dumbed down dribble in every class, no matter what it was.
[03:39:23.751 --> 03:39:27.675]  They'd go, I have a friend in the Foreign Service.
[03:39:28.976 --> 03:39:29.957]  Did you know in Cuba?
[03:39:30.338 --> 03:39:33.261]  It's always like an American accent, but they try to anglicize it like NPR.
[03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:38.901]  Did you know that one in ten is a doctor in Cuba?
[03:39:39.681 --> 03:39:40.561]  Education's free!
[03:39:41.601 --> 03:39:43.281]  It's incredible, and we're going to have that here.
[03:39:44.182 --> 03:39:46.762]  Now, let me tell you about fundamentally how evil white people are.
[03:39:47.022 --> 03:39:48.762]  Here is an image of a woman of the future.
[03:39:49.483 --> 03:39:56.264]  She is brown, she is not white, she is not black, but one people... And then it was just like, oh my god, and the next class, it didn't matter.
[03:39:56.284 --> 03:39:58.844]  I thought, well that's anthropology, or that's psychology, no.
[03:39:59.324 --> 03:40:01.805]  It was the mathematics classes, it was everything.
[03:40:03.573 --> 03:40:14.377]  Except for one mathematics class where the lady was actually from Africa, and she was like, all these leftists need to actually go to Africa and see what it's like, and all the stuff you hear at this university, all this leftist stuff.
[03:40:14.397 --> 03:40:17.278]  And he's like, I'm not even a conservative, but let me tell you something.
[03:40:17.598 --> 03:40:27.702]  This America-hating crap, all the things you hear, it's communism, and it's what's brought down the country I came from, and all of you that are leftists, you need to go to Africa before you listen to these people.
[03:40:29.462 --> 03:40:30.363]  And I remember that lady.
[03:40:30.523 --> 03:40:31.163]  She was an African.
[03:40:37.290 --> 03:40:39.151]  And she was freaked out.
[03:40:40.811 --> 03:40:44.972]  So, these universities are madhouses.
[03:40:45.393 --> 03:40:46.533]  They're madhouses.
[03:40:47.593 --> 03:40:51.895]  And the more money government puts into healthcare, it drives down the quality, it drives up the price.
[03:40:52.215 --> 03:40:56.856]  That's what it does when Obama goes, we're gonna make everybody buy insurance.
[03:40:57.456 --> 03:40:58.116]  What do you think?
[03:40:58.176 --> 03:40:59.017]  The price is tripled.
[03:41:01.037 --> 03:41:01.638]  Of course it does.
[03:41:03.878 --> 03:41:06.079]  If the government said, you've gotta buy,
[03:41:09.745 --> 03:41:10.245]  X car.
[03:41:11.226 --> 03:41:12.787]  What are the sellers of that car going to do?
[03:41:12.807 --> 03:41:13.728]  They're going to up the price.
[03:41:15.629 --> 03:41:16.669]  Plus it's going to drive up demand.
[03:41:17.890 --> 03:41:20.592]  So, it's the same deal ladies and gentlemen.
[03:41:20.612 --> 03:41:24.955]  Can you imagine people that are actually from Africa and they get here and it's the best living they've ever had?
[03:41:26.072 --> 03:41:29.073]  And everybody's running around, bitching and complaining and handing everything?
[03:41:29.333 --> 03:41:34.715]  That's why I run into Africans that are taxi drivers or whatever, or people that I've met working at a hotel or whatever.
[03:41:34.735 --> 03:41:36.155]  They're like, oh, I like you, Alex.
[03:41:36.215 --> 03:41:37.336]  Oh, I know what you're saying is right.
[03:41:37.676 --> 03:41:40.877]  My family in Nigeria was blown up by Muslims 10 years ago.
[03:41:41.177 --> 03:41:42.077]  My brother was killed.
[03:41:42.117 --> 03:41:42.517]  You're right.
[03:41:42.838 --> 03:41:43.878]  God bless President Trump.
[03:41:46.087 --> 03:41:52.229]  And then you see spoiled rotten American blacks, spoiled rotten American whites all bitching with their smartphones and fancy jeans and everything.
[03:41:52.249 --> 03:41:55.289]  The poorest person's got more than anybody in most of the country's bitching.
[03:41:55.329 --> 03:41:56.830]  Yeah, screw this country.
[03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:58.190]  Yeah, whatever, man.
[03:41:59.371 --> 03:42:00.431]  Fascist crap.
[03:42:00.891 --> 03:42:02.111]  Right-wing people.
[03:42:02.591 --> 03:42:04.252]  Yeah, you know, white privilege.
[03:42:12.194 --> 03:42:13.394]  Christians failed Africa, though.
[03:42:13.434 --> 03:42:15.595]  Christians went in there, built industry.
[03:42:16.934 --> 03:42:23.218]  Exploited a lot of stuff, but the population exploded because there was medicine and stuff, and then now it's out of control.
[03:42:23.238 --> 03:42:30.623]  I mean, Africa's population, depending on what numbers you look at, it's like a hundred times what it was 300 years ago.
[03:42:34.346 --> 03:42:38.589]  But the leaders are corrupt.
[03:42:40.265 --> 03:42:48.960]  And the people try to come here to get away from that, and the left is waiting, preying on them to get control of them and run their lives and recreate the hell they came from right here.
[03:42:49.661 --> 03:42:52.025]  Other big clips, other big news, straight ahead, stay with us.
[03:42:58.639 --> 03:43:16.955]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:17.035 --> 03:43:22.460]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:23.341 --> 03:43:24.021]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:24.121 --> 03:43:26.163]  Immune wall, beta-glucose,
[03:43:26.203 --> 03:43:28.925]  Glucons, olive leaf, and so much more.
[03:43:29.465 --> 03:43:30.586]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:30.826 --> 03:43:32.527]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:32.547 --> 03:43:38.250]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:38.350 --> 03:43:39.551]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:39.571 --> 03:43:41.512]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:41.592 --> 03:43:43.974]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:44.174 --> 03:43:45.435]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:45.615 --> 03:43:47.436]  Beta, glucon, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:47.976 --> 03:43:48.576]  Immune Wall.

[03:45:06.474 --> 03:45:09.136]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[03:45:09.216 --> 03:45:15.199]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[03:45:15.239 --> 03:45:17.560]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[03:45:17.720 --> 03:45:25.905]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[03:45:25.985 --> 03:45:28.867]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[03:45:29.287 --> 03:45:38.971]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[03:45:39.051 --> 03:45:42.273]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[03:45:42.393 --> 03:45:50.096]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:50.136 --> 03:45:51.157]  Brain Force Plus.
[03:45:51.217 --> 03:45:53.298]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[03:45:53.338 --> 03:45:54.358]  It was hilarious.
[03:45:56.459 --> 03:45:58.661]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[03:45:58.781 --> 03:46:08.589]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[03:46:08.629 --> 03:46:11.031]  This isn't like some pokey snake oil.
[03:46:11.651 --> 03:46:18.076]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[03:46:18.677 --> 03:46:20.298]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[03:46:21.480 --> 03:46:27.769]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[03:46:27.829 --> 03:46:29.952]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[03:46:30.312 --> 03:46:31.474]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[03:46:31.534 --> 03:46:31.794]  Good.
[03:46:32.054 --> 03:46:33.356]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[03:46:33.536 --> 03:46:35.860]  You're literally making Infowars and me money.
[03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:38.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.130 --> 03:47:19.291]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:22.272 --> 03:47:26.713]  The poets tell how Poncho fell.
[03:47:27.653 --> 03:47:30.514]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:47:31.574 --> 03:47:34.574]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:47:35.575 --> 03:47:38.315]  So the story ends, we're told.
[03:47:39.475 --> 03:47:41.856]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:47:43.480 --> 03:47:53.963]  All right, I've got some final stories to cover, and then O. Troyer, Roger Stone, and others take over with the War Room, always power-packed and informative.
[03:47:54.763 --> 03:47:56.724]  And remember, you know all this stuff.
[03:47:57.604 --> 03:48:01.345]  Your friends, your family, your neighbors are just now willing to wake up and see it.
[03:48:01.845 --> 03:48:08.987]  We're at the critical flashpoint, the turning point, the jump point, the event horizon, the crossroads, the fulcrum.
[03:48:10.011 --> 03:48:10.751]  The tipping point.
[03:48:11.272 --> 03:48:16.414]  And so that's why we need you more than ever to spread the word so we're not under the globalist dominion.
[03:48:17.814 --> 03:48:19.755]  Much of this for us is not even intellectual anymore.
[03:48:19.795 --> 03:48:20.636]  We've won that fight.
[03:48:20.696 --> 03:48:21.396]  We know the facts.
[03:48:21.776 --> 03:48:23.537]  It's now just about pushing the info.
[03:48:23.857 --> 03:48:29.279]  Not bullying, not doing like the left does, but just putting out the truth and not bowing to their evil.
[03:48:32.861 --> 03:48:35.582]  They claim data mining was invented in 2013 by a guy with pink hair.
[03:48:39.326 --> 03:48:44.629]  Because he worked and is a whistleblower out of this analytics deal out in the UK.
[03:48:46.169 --> 03:48:50.591]  And the big crime was that Facebook just let conservative groups get in there and organize.
[03:48:50.912 --> 03:48:52.072]  That's all been shut down now.
[03:48:52.732 --> 03:48:55.854]  But they're trying to teach you that that's all that goes on and that it was just invented there.
[03:48:56.734 --> 03:48:57.675]  Because they think you're a moron.
[03:48:58.863 --> 03:48:59.903]  Utterly horrifying!
[03:49:00.303 --> 03:49:04.604]  Ex-Facebook inciters of covert data harvesting!
[03:49:05.044 --> 03:49:06.964]  Was it Chinese communists harvesting organs?
[03:49:07.044 --> 03:49:07.404]  Is that bad?
[03:49:07.484 --> 03:49:08.785]  Oh, no, of course not!
[03:49:08.825 --> 03:49:15.306]  No, I mean, I mean, covert data open source harvesting was routine!
[03:49:15.786 --> 03:49:18.066]  It must be banned off the big giants!
[03:49:18.526 --> 03:49:27.548]  Any communication, any talking to anyone, any organizing by anybody but the Facebook, that the former head of the Obama campaign says that they owned and controlled,
[03:49:28.288 --> 03:49:30.950]  It's just you can't allow it, you understand me?
[03:49:32.812 --> 03:49:34.453]  They think you're so stupid you don't get it.
[03:49:37.175 --> 03:49:41.919]  Now continuing, people are ready to buy some guns in the world's murder capital.
[03:49:42.940 --> 03:49:49.185]  Bloomberg has a big detail report about how they have the highest crime rate in the world, even over Mexico.
[03:49:50.306 --> 03:49:55.510]  And it's because they have a total zero no-gun policy for over 50 years.
[03:49:56.110 --> 03:49:57.832]  And now the leading candidate to be president
[03:49:59.989 --> 03:50:00.069]  It's
[03:50:19.332 --> 03:50:25.857]  They understand what's going on, smart people, a lot of resources, really cool culture, but they've got no Second Amendment.
[03:50:26.457 --> 03:50:29.500]  And if you don't have that, you're going to have gangs in government ruling you, just like Mexico.
[03:50:30.140 --> 03:50:34.663]  I mean, it's an absolute fact that if Mexico would have had a Second Amendment from the beginning, it'd be just like the U.S.
[03:50:35.004 --> 03:50:35.764]  Same thing with Brazil.
[03:50:36.044 --> 03:50:38.907]  Venezuela had one, Argentina kind of had one, but that went away.
[03:50:38.927 --> 03:50:46.012]  The whole, the money, it's like opening a space door, a bulkhead in space, a portal, and like, the oxygen just went out.
[03:50:46.072 --> 03:50:48.414]  Well, wow, this really doesn't work too well.
[03:50:49.980 --> 03:50:51.482]  He wants to make it a citizen's right.
[03:50:52.122 --> 03:50:54.845]  Civilian gun ownership goes into gun control.
[03:50:56.227 --> 03:51:04.456]  And they talk about the overwhelming global tendency towards more restrictions of gun owners and how it's, you know, wrong.
[03:51:06.198 --> 03:51:07.459]  So it's very, very exciting.
[03:51:07.740 --> 03:51:11.124]  In the world's most murderous country, gun control is starting to lose its appeal.
[03:51:12.941 --> 03:51:19.466]  Desperate Brazilians are wondering whether they'd be better off armed, given that around 60,000 of their compatriots are killed each year.
[03:51:19.887 --> 03:51:22.328]  Polls show support for gun ownership gaining ground.
[03:51:22.809 --> 03:51:24.790]  In an election year, politicians are paying attention.
[03:51:25.391 --> 03:51:34.838]  One of the candidates leading the field of October's 2018 presidential election, hard-line conservative, that means he's right-of-nosey-tongue, Jarr,
[03:51:36.159 --> 03:51:37.140]  He pronounced this right.
[03:51:37.160 --> 03:51:38.360]  Is that hair?
[03:51:38.640 --> 03:51:39.420]  J-A-I-R.
[03:51:39.941 --> 03:51:42.222]  Jair Bolsonaro.
[03:51:42.682 --> 03:51:43.222]  How do you say that?
[03:51:43.242 --> 03:51:44.623]  I can't even speak English hardly.
[03:51:46.183 --> 03:51:46.443]  Okay.
[03:51:47.024 --> 03:51:55.427]  Has promised to allow law-abiding citizens to arm themselves, a popular pledge of the nation, with by far the most homicides.
[03:51:55.827 --> 03:51:58.988]  And again, he goes into very strict gun control.
[03:52:00.089 --> 03:52:00.669]  So there you go.
[03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.490]  Boom.
[03:52:02.290 --> 03:52:04.831]  Let's continue on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:07.375 --> 03:52:12.636]  Californians fed up with housing costs and taxes are fleeing the state at record numbers.
[03:52:13.536 --> 03:52:15.016]  But see, it's like a space door.
[03:52:15.036 --> 03:52:15.796]  It's like a bulkhead.
[03:52:16.037 --> 03:52:16.717]  Use the same analogy.
[03:52:16.997 --> 03:52:19.917]  You open it, and the whole spaceship floods out into space.
[03:52:20.797 --> 03:52:22.018]  And that's out of CNBC.
[03:52:23.738 --> 03:52:28.459]  And it goes into the fact that when they come to Texas, God love them.
[03:52:29.839 --> 03:52:32.139]  You got a family, they walk up and say it's weird.
[03:52:32.399 --> 03:52:32.839]  If you're white.
[03:52:33.279 --> 03:52:34.340]  It'll be white people doing this, by the way.
[03:52:34.360 --> 03:52:35.720]  They're the weird mental patient minders.
[03:52:36.778 --> 03:52:43.062]  I think they're virtue signaling, you know, through the crowds of majority minorities who don't even listen to them in California.
[03:52:43.122 --> 03:52:44.844]  They're just there to try to live in America.
[03:52:45.744 --> 03:52:48.426]  And it's bad if you've got a truck.
[03:52:48.866 --> 03:52:50.327]  It's bad if you've got a big car.
[03:52:50.387 --> 03:52:51.628]  It's bad if you're a conservative.
[03:52:51.989 --> 03:52:54.210]  If you've got a Trump hat on, they hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[03:52:54.370 --> 03:52:56.071]  I mean, they are fruitcakes.
[03:52:56.892 --> 03:53:00.795]  You know, if I was leaving something because I didn't like it, I wouldn't come recreate it.
[03:53:01.235 --> 03:53:04.737]  Not a crazy girlfriend or something, you know, that, say, hurt herself.
[03:53:05.737 --> 03:53:09.579]  You know, I would not see her anymore, and then I wouldn't get another girlfriend that hurt herself.
[03:53:11.879 --> 03:53:14.961]  And it just goes into the massive, massive record exodus.
[03:53:15.441 --> 03:53:17.482]  Millions and millions are pouring out.
[03:53:17.962 --> 03:53:22.884]  And so California's answer is to flood even more people in who don't have skills.
[03:53:24.244 --> 03:53:28.086]  And then it just goes into outbound migration.
[03:53:29.683 --> 03:53:31.184]  It gets into the housing problem.
[03:53:31.304 --> 03:53:36.466]  It gets into just the fact that expensive rents.
[03:53:36.546 --> 03:53:37.706]  Welcome to feudalism.
[03:53:38.227 --> 03:53:39.307]  Middle class leaving.
[03:53:39.347 --> 03:53:40.307]  That's the critical part.
[03:53:41.008 --> 03:53:46.570]  Internal Revenue Service data would appear to show that the middle class and middle-aged residents are the ones leaving.
[03:53:46.650 --> 03:53:50.391]  God, California is going to just totally implode.
[03:53:50.752 --> 03:53:55.153]  A Presidential Fellow in Urban Features at Chapman University in Orange, California.
[03:53:55.454 --> 03:53:58.695]  We know the actual net migration out of California has been growing.
[03:53:59.315 --> 03:54:00.016]  And it just goes on.
[03:54:00.537 --> 03:54:01.699]  Highest taxes in the USA.
[03:54:01.719 --> 03:54:03.481]  Well, I thought that was a good thing.
[03:54:06.125 --> 03:54:11.252]  Meanwhile, the Democrats have always been race-based since they ran the KKK, since they lost the first Civil War.
[03:54:14.491 --> 03:54:17.033]  And so I'm going to play a clip of Demographics with Tucker Carlson.
[03:54:33.666 --> 03:54:39.889]  To then have race-based blocks of voting, so people don't vote for Second Amendment, free market, things for themselves.
[03:54:40.329 --> 03:54:50.813]  They vote along skin color, thus robbing themselves of actually smartly voting in coalitions with white people, you name it, for free market, because we don't want to be Venezuela or Russia or China.
[03:54:51.514 --> 03:54:51.714]  See?
[03:54:52.574 --> 03:54:55.355]  So they just want you to show your birthright on racism.
[03:54:55.635 --> 03:54:58.076]  And they think they're betting on minorities being racist.
[03:54:58.957 --> 03:55:00.998]  So far it's not delivered like they thought, but
[03:55:01.704 --> 03:55:03.209]  They just think get enough in it will.
[03:55:03.812 --> 03:55:07.143]  So let's play that clip from Tucker Carlson on The Demographics.
[03:55:08.055 --> 03:55:18.182]  A recent piece in National Geographic tells you a lot about demographics in America and about how bewilderingly fast they're changing without any real public debate on the subject.
[03:55:18.902 --> 03:55:21.964]  The magazine profiles a small coal mining town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania.
[03:55:22.525 --> 03:55:26.207]  In the year 2000, Hazleton's population was 2% Hispanic.
[03:55:26.587 --> 03:55:30.370]  Just 16 years later, Hazleton is majority Hispanic.
[03:55:30.770 --> 03:55:31.591]  That's a lot of change.
[03:55:32.091 --> 03:55:36.414]  People who grew up in Hazleton returned to find out they can't communicate with the people who now live there.
[03:55:36.514 --> 03:55:37.815]  And that's bewildering for people.
[03:55:38.295 --> 03:55:40.017]  That's happening all over the country.
[03:55:40.498 --> 03:55:44.722]  No nation, no society has ever changed this much, this fast.
[03:55:45.483 --> 03:55:51.210]  Now before you start calling anyone bigoted, consider and be honest, how would you feel if that happened in your neighborhood?
[03:55:51.230 --> 03:55:53.192]  It doesn't matter how nice the immigrants are.
[03:55:53.612 --> 03:55:54.433]  They probably are nice.
[03:55:54.533 --> 03:55:55.454]  Most immigrants are nice.
[03:55:55.755 --> 03:55:56.455]  That's not the point.
[03:55:57.156 --> 03:56:01.657]  The point is, this is more change than human beings are designed to digest.
[03:56:02.298 --> 03:56:08.159]  This pace of change makes societies volatile, really volatile, just as ours has become volatile.
[03:56:08.839 --> 03:56:10.620]  And notice where this change is not happening.
[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:12.721]  Anyplace our leaders live.
[03:56:13.181 --> 03:56:18.862]  They caused all of this with their reckless immigration policies, and yet their own neighborhoods are basically unchanged.
[03:56:18.882 --> 03:56:20.623]  They look like it's 1960.
[03:56:21.203 --> 03:56:24.104]  No demographic change at all in their zip codes.
[03:56:24.944 --> 03:56:27.285]  Our leaders are for diversity, just not where they live.
[03:56:34.435 --> 03:56:35.676]  And I've been around leftists, man.
[03:56:35.716 --> 03:56:37.096]  They do not like brown people.
[03:56:37.176 --> 03:56:40.177]  I mean, I'm telling you, it's crazy if you know how evil they are.
[03:56:40.878 --> 03:56:41.598]  And see, that's the thing.
[03:56:42.418 --> 03:56:44.639]  If you're going to bring in Mexico, that's fine.
[03:56:44.799 --> 03:56:47.700]  Indoctrinate folks, free will, into the free market in America.
[03:56:48.101 --> 03:56:56.884]  Then don't bring the gangs with them and let them now feed on that subgroup that the left, the Democrats, sits above the Mexican mafia, and then they sit above the Mexican.
[03:56:57.064 --> 03:56:58.705]  And then it goes through that for each demographic.
[03:57:00.034 --> 03:57:00.614]  It's incredible.
[03:57:00.794 --> 03:57:01.695]  And that's the plan.
[03:57:02.115 --> 03:57:03.256]  It's a race-based system.
[03:57:03.596 --> 03:57:04.177]  I don't want that.
[03:57:04.657 --> 03:57:10.500]  I want it to be a political, economic system, cultural system based on ideas.
[03:57:11.041 --> 03:57:13.602]  And then it doesn't matter what color you are if we're all on the same team.
[03:57:13.882 --> 03:57:15.964]  Hey, free market really gives us a lot of opportunities.
[03:57:16.324 --> 03:57:17.084]  It builds a lot of great things.
[03:57:17.104 --> 03:57:18.305]  Speaking of that, I didn't plug this hour.
[03:57:18.605 --> 03:57:19.546]  Without you, we're not here.
[03:57:19.566 --> 03:57:21.047]  A bunch of big specials are about to end.
[03:57:21.067 --> 03:57:23.928]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration.
[03:57:23.968 --> 03:57:24.429]  That's huge.
[03:57:24.749 --> 03:57:29.152]  Got the new super blue silver immune gargle.
[03:57:30.032 --> 03:57:34.614]  We've got the great Mico ZX Plus, now stronger, less price, 50% off.
[03:57:34.894 --> 03:57:36.015]  That's going to have to end very soon.
[03:57:36.375 --> 03:57:40.057]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:57:40.097 --> 03:57:42.058]  The War Room is about to begin.
[03:57:42.098 --> 03:57:44.399]  Please share the live links and local stations.
[03:57:48.829 --> 03:57:53.270]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:53.490 --> 03:57:58.172]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:57:58.792 --> 03:58:04.633]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:58:05.053 --> 03:58:17.657]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:18.417 --> 03:58:27.063]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law and Family Code.
[03:58:27.083 --> 03:58:29.005]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:58:29.345 --> 03:58:30.446]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:58:30.466 --> 03:58:31.747]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:58:31.767 --> 03:58:33.148]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:58:33.268 --> 03:58:34.829]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:36.971]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:58:37.291 --> 03:58:38.752]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:58:39.112 --> 03:58:41.714]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:58:41.754 --> 03:58:42.615]  This is insane.
[03:58:43.015 --> 03:58:44.636]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:58:44.896 --> 03:58:47.458]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:58:47.818 --> 03:58:49.420]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:58:49.460 --> 03:58:51.281]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:58:51.301 --> 03:58:53.162]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:58:54.043 --> 03:58:59.667]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
