[00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:22.026]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:31.833]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:40.960]  One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small, and the ones that
[00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:55.759]  We are 54 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:57.560]  That's universally accepted.
[00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.562]  Trump is 100% real.
[00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.044]  Totally fighting to bring the country back.
[00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:14.175]  He has to walk a very fine line, though, because they think it can destroy confidence if we admit that we were basically in the final phases of being captured by the Communist Chinese in a consortium with Goldman Sachs.
[00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:15.713]  And others.
[00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:18.254]  Now Trump has done what you do in a corporate takeover.
[00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:21.035]  They were taking us over in a corporate takeover.
[00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:22.156]  A hostile takeover.
[00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.416]  So he wants the equipment.
[00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:25.537]  He wants the whole operation.
[00:01:25.597 --> 00:01:27.718]  So he's taking it back over.
[00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.659]  People ask, well, why does he have Goldman Sachs in his administration?
[00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.439]  Because they know how things work.
[00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:33.720]  So he can tell them what to do.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.643]  Just like if I was Lewis and Clark going out west and about to find a passage across the country by land.
[00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:46.987]  The first Westerners to do that, I would go get the local native guides.
[00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:54.770]  Doesn't mean that I would agree with all of their customs or their policies, but that's where they famously said, Jones is insane.
[00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.673]  He believes goblins are real and that Trump is going to go into a goblin nest and kill them.
[00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:05.395]  No, I said the allegory is if you were in Mordor in Middle Earth, that was a real place.
[00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:16.579]  In some alternate dimension, and you had to go into Mordor, and you wanted to go throw the ring of doom into the crack of doom, then what would you do?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.842]  You would want a guide like Smeagol or Gollum.
[00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:22.244]  Does it mean that you like Gollum?
[00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:23.925]  It doesn't mean that you kiss Gollum?
[00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:25.967]  Does it mean that you marry Gollum?
[00:02:26.427 --> 00:02:30.570]  And so I said, we don't want to have Trump in bed with goblins.
[00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.374]  We don't want him to have sex with a goblin.
[00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:36.655]  And so that got watched like 40-something million views total.
[00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:39.736]  Because the media thought it discredited me.
[00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:43.438]  But instead it was fun and I got a massive audience from it of young people.
[00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:44.738]  But I'm digressing.
[00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.300]  The stress level, you can cut with a knife right now.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.464]  I could almost not go on air today because of the magnitude and the stress and just how serious things are.
[00:02:58.784 --> 00:02:59.284]  Not for me.
[00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.107]  People keep asking how I can handle all these unprecedented attacks.
[00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.911]  Only Trump's been attacked more than I. It's now official.
[00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:14.902]  Because the globalists are evil and they're taking our country and our world over, it's the only chance we've got.
[00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:19.207]  And I've used this analogy many times.
[00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:28.189]  There have been famous cases where people weren't even good swimmers, but a big ship had tumped over, and they had to swim, you know, 50, 100 yards in total darkness to get out, and people were able to do it.
[00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:36.731]  Just like those, you know, kids that had never been scuba diving in the mine collapse that happened a few months ago, and they got a crash course in it, and they made it out.
[00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:39.011]  It's not courage.
[00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:42.012]  I am desperately trying to not be a slave.
[00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:50.533]  I would not be fighting tooth and nail at my own personal risk if we were just being taken over by some superior capitalist system.
[00:03:51.854 --> 00:03:53.475]  I would simply try to be part of that.
[00:03:55.796 --> 00:03:57.457]  I'm all about adopting things.
[00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:59.099]  I'm all about things that are better.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.320]  Marrying them.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.661]  That's what you do.
[00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:10.688]  I don't want to be at war with everybody, but the globalists are really nasty, devil-worshipping, blood-drinking pedophiles.
[00:04:11.088 --> 00:04:16.771]  And you know, you see it all over the news, oh, children's blood goes for $18,000 a quart.
[00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:19.933]  That's mainstream news this week.
[00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.674]  I told you that 20 years ago.
[00:04:22.714 --> 00:04:23.795]  It's in the medical literature.
[00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:30.458]  I know rich people here in town that told me 10 years ago, I ought to go get children's blood.
[00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.160]  I know people that do it.
[00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:36.653]  So don't tell me!
[00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:39.034]  I know!
[00:04:39.054 --> 00:04:44.356]  And that's why they hate me, because the globalists tune in and they go, this guy has got our number!
[00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:48.618]  So, the ultra-massive news straight ahead.
[00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:49.798]  I haven't even told you what it is yet.
[00:04:50.618 --> 00:04:51.559]  I saw this yesterday.
[00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:52.619]  It's not getting attention it deserves.
[00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:53.840]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.922]  And it is thousands of armed men in camouflage coming across the U.S.
[00:04:59.122 --> 00:04:59.682]  on horseback.
[00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:00.883]  This is an invasion.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.521]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:04.962]  Go ahead.
[00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:07.443]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[00:05:07.463 --> 00:05:10.506]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:12.427]  It just gets old, man.
[00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:14.488]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.270]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.513]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:24.015]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.137]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:05:27.157 --> 00:05:28.638]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:05:28.858 --> 00:05:29.739]  Us being shut down?
[00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.020]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.480]  You know what, Alex?
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.601]  Put him on pause again.
[00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:34.441]  Hey, Frank!
[00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:40.082]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:44.663]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:05:44.903 --> 00:05:47.764]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:05:48.044 --> 00:05:48.424]  You understand?
[00:05:48.504 --> 00:05:49.764]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:51.305]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:57.186]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:58.827]  Do you understand?
[00:05:58.847 --> 00:06:00.027]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:27.263]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:41.549]  Owen Troyer is going to be in studio with us in the second hour.
[00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:59.088]  I had seen the article from the Daily Caller yesterday afternoon, but I hadn't watched the video.
[00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:07.691]  And then, last night, I saw that Owen had done a live feed on his
[00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:16.263]  Facebook going to one of these local churches that the Democrats have taken over and turned into a UN invasion base.
[00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:19.285]  Literally, that's who funds it and runs it, George Soros.
[00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:20.146]  It's all public.
[00:07:20.887 --> 00:07:21.747]  Can't make this stuff up.
[00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:36.120]  And Owen confronted them about thousands of armed men, thousands of men in camouflage, many on horseback armed with assault rifles entering the United States.
[00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:50.443]  Now, if you understand that the border in Arizona and in Texas is about 80% Hispanic, and they're American citizens, and they're the folks begging for walls.
[00:07:51.444 --> 00:08:01.435]  When I was a child, we got out of the border and it was romantic, it was safe, it was fun, the food was great, we go into Mexico, you might worry about getting pickpocketed, but that was it.
[00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:10.544]  There are hundreds of thousands dead now along the Texas border, all the way through Arizona, all the way into California, on the 2,000 miles.
[00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:24.350]  And you've got men in this video, and there's video, it goes on for hours and hours, thousands of them, in camouflage, carrying large square rucksacks on their back.
[00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.011]  Now, we know what's in it because there's two types.
[00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.312]  Those are marijuana rucksacks.
[00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:48.204]  A member of the crew a few years ago during the campaign famously got footage down in Brownsville of large containers of drugs coming across, being put in the back of a vehicle, and then the folks run back across and jump in the river and swim back.
[00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:51.126]  Those are called mules.
[00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:53.827]  They are the drug shippers.
[00:08:53.887 --> 00:08:59.590]  The media said it was a conspiracy theory, that Trump was wrong when he talked about our video, that it did not exist.
[00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:15.995]  We have hundreds of thousands dead on the US-Mexico border.
[00:09:16.195 --> 00:09:22.420]  It is rated the most dangerous country on earth, year in, year out.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.541]  Sometimes it loses to Guatemala.
[00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:28.364]  South Africa is now in the top 10.
[00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:35.109]  Hundreds of thousands missing, hundreds of thousands dead,
[00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:38.400]  Many of them women and children.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.143]  And they're killed by the cartels and the psychopaths and the criminals that haunt that area.
[00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:49.006]  But again, you turn on the news, you hear about crying children.
[00:09:49.426 --> 00:09:50.967]  Many of which come across by themselves.
[00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:53.309]  You bet they don't just put them with...
[00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:56.593]  Other adults in a facility.
[00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:59.914]  That started decades ago when the ACLU filed lawsuits.
[00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:01.234]  And you know what they should have?
[00:10:01.474 --> 00:10:08.616]  You shouldn't be putting 10, 12 year old kids, you don't know their identities, in with adults in general area, in a warehouse.
[00:10:11.016 --> 00:10:11.957]  But that's how they lie.
[00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:17.258]  They make a big deal out of what's already going on, on a collapsed Road Warrior border.
[00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:20.758]  That is more dangerous than anything out of Road Warrior.
[00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:23.199]  It is literally Road Warrior.
[00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:28.171]  Type in, uh, cartels building their own warwagons and tanks.
[00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:31.213]  And there is footage that comes out of Mexico.
[00:10:31.393 --> 00:10:33.634]  YouTube takes it down, though, because they don't want you seeing it.
[00:10:34.314 --> 00:10:35.175]  Not that it's even violent.
[00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:38.237]  It is violent, but it's not as graphic as what's on TV.
[00:10:39.577 --> 00:10:44.260]  And it's giant warwagons shooting at each other, attacking, blowing up, running over people.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.363]  And you'll see, like, 15 warwagons and 50-cal machine guns and stuff exploding.
[00:10:49.863 --> 00:10:50.864]  And people just running.
[00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:57.365]  Now there it is, seven incredible narco tanks built by Mexican cartels.
[00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:59.787]  Beyond Mad Max says Business Insider.
[00:11:01.148 --> 00:11:01.328]  See?
[00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:03.029]  Exactly what I told you.
[00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.412]  It is Road Warrior.
[00:11:07.453 --> 00:11:11.716]  Except it's not a guy named Humongous going, just give us the gas, we spare your lives.
[00:11:12.717 --> 00:11:14.318]  No, he's not wearing a Jason mask.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.222]  It's not a bunch of gay punk rock dudes that are doing a killing.
[00:11:18.482 --> 00:11:19.703]  You know, that's sci-fi fiction.
[00:11:23.698 --> 00:11:34.287]  It is Mexicans with huge satanic tattoos that worship Satan and the Grim Reaper and MS-13 that tortures children to get demonic power.
[00:11:34.307 --> 00:11:36.429]  Imagine a road warrior like that.
[00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:42.375]  200,000 dead.
[00:11:43.195 --> 00:11:45.357]  Giant 18-wheeler war wagons.
[00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:48.720]  That's what's going on.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.562]  Hundreds of billions of dollars pouring through.
[00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:53.892]  Burnout vehicles everywhere.
[00:11:54.793 --> 00:12:01.999]  And then they tell the naive American people and the naive leftist that we are naive, folks, of what's on that border.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:02.740]  I'm not.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.221]  I live here.
[00:12:06.704 --> 00:12:08.345]  They say, oh, we're being mean.
[00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:12.249]  Everyone's fleeing, scared to death to get up here.
[00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:18.079]  So, I've never seen footage this powerful.
[00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:19.660]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.341]  We can't tweet it out, but you can.
[00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:28.205]  Heavily armed individuals caught on camera entering country illegally through Arizona Ranch.
[00:12:29.846 --> 00:12:38.972]  And it goes on to say, shows thousands of illegal aliens marching in the United States, uninterrupted because there is no border wall, no border patrol to stop them.
[00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:42.774]  And they have assault rifles.
[00:12:44.082 --> 00:12:45.243]  And they have horses.
[00:12:47.504 --> 00:12:50.967]  So it's like Road Warrior meets Planet of the Apes.
[00:12:51.768 --> 00:12:53.429]  Where you got people on horseback.
[00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:55.330]  This is insane!
[00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:05.617]  So this is industrial level drugs being brought across.
[00:13:06.858 --> 00:13:07.779]  And that's your passage.
[00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:08.900]  You pay them a certain amount of money.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.442]  A lot of them are Central or South American or from other countries.
[00:13:12.489 --> 00:13:14.430]  Now it's something like 15% or other than Mexican.
[00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:17.513]  They used to always have different terms.
[00:13:18.353 --> 00:13:19.634]  They used to always be mainly Mexicans.
[00:13:20.315 --> 00:13:21.596]  Now it's Chinese, you name it.
[00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:31.563]  And they're coming across and part of their pay is to carry the rucksack of marijuana or cocaine on their back.
[00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:39.269]  I think there's hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of footage released of thousands of men.
[00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:40.630]  You see those boxes?
[00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:46.908]  The bags, the rucksacks are generally marijuana.
[00:13:47.148 --> 00:13:49.569]  The boxes are cocaine or heroin.
[00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.289]  Black tar, Mexican heroin.
[00:13:58.692 --> 00:14:08.415]  So... Video footage from Arizona shows illegals, thousands of them, marching in the United States uninterrupted.
[00:14:10.696 --> 00:14:11.876]  Because there is no border wall.
[00:14:15.017 --> 00:14:24.759]  Jim Chilton, 79, owns a 50,000-acre ranch situated on the U.S.-Mexico border, which has become a hotspot for illegals crossing into the country.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.980]  And again, it's a bunch of scrub brush, but he's real rich, 50,000 acres.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.661]  Yeah, right.
[00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:32.441]  Can't even hardly put 5,000 cows on that.
[00:14:34.362 --> 00:14:43.024]  Security camera footage from recently, it's 2018, shows individuals in camouflage, toting large backpacks, and in some cases,
[00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:52.878]  What appears to be military-style assault rifles, walking to his ranch, into the states, incident-free.
[00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:56.400]  They even attach military-style assault rifles to horses.
[00:14:58.781 --> 00:14:59.361]  This is 2018.
[00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.362]  And this has been going on for a while.
[00:15:01.482 --> 00:15:03.143]  And then the left sits there.
[00:15:04.444 --> 00:15:05.964]  They want our guns as citizens.
[00:15:05.984 --> 00:15:06.905]  They want us disarmed.
[00:15:07.785 --> 00:15:08.946]  They want to control our children.
[00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:09.806]  They want to run our lives.
[00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:11.147]  And then,
[00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:17.626]  If we try to have any border at all, they say we're the most horrible, worst people, we're racist, it goes on and on.
[00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:41.818]  And the UN now stages in Guatemala, and in Nicaragua, and El Salvador, three giant migrant centers, for all over the world, to give them several thousand dollars a piece, a bag of food and other necessities, clothing, you name it, and then staging zones, and the Mexicans let them go up the railways, they say don't go into Mexico,
[00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:44.308]  And then they hit the U.S.
[00:15:44.428 --> 00:15:47.211]  with the Democratic groups waiting to snatch them up.
[00:15:48.252 --> 00:15:56.659]  To be a client group they control for illegal voting, political activities, and now MS-13's been confirmed to be carrying out assassinations for the Democratic Party.
[00:15:57.359 --> 00:15:59.962]  That's right, MS-13 is now a murder arm of the Democrats.
[00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.877]  Alex Jones was quite the spectacle today.
[00:16:04.937 --> 00:16:13.459]  The most relevant part of this so far has been an interaction that Marco Rubio had while talking to reporters with Alex Jones.
[00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:18.720]  You know, look, part of this I think you could argue and say, why are you guys giving them any attention for this nonsense?
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.121]  But I think there's a point to this that's important.
[00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:22.161]  Here is this sort of spectacle.
[00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:26.922]  Marco Rubio is doing an interview and Alex Jones bumbles up to him.
[00:16:27.042 --> 00:16:33.029]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:39.636]  I think Facebook now, I think it's important for them not to comply with any efforts to sort of go after freedom of expression.
[00:16:39.676 --> 00:16:41.438]  What about the Democrats purging conservatives?
[00:16:41.578 --> 00:16:42.599]  She's not answering.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.362]  Just that the Republicans are acting like it isn't happening.
[00:16:45.742 --> 00:16:46.503]  Thank God Trump is.
[00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:47.724]  It's weird.
[00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:48.925]  Oh yeah, it's really weird.
[00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:50.086]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[00:16:50.126 --> 00:16:51.387]  There's no shadow banning.
[00:16:51.648 --> 00:16:54.050]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.413]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[00:16:57.553 --> 00:17:00.095]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[00:17:00.295 --> 00:17:05.720]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... It's not a heckler.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.541]  I'd oppress a gaggle.
[00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:07.321]  Look at this guy.
[00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.942]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[00:17:09.283 --> 00:17:10.743]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[00:17:10.803 --> 00:17:11.984]  I don't read through your website.
[00:17:12.044 --> 00:17:12.344]  Sure.
[00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:14.626]  And they demonize me in these fair hearings.
[00:17:14.686 --> 00:17:15.526]  And then he plays dumb.
[00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:17.207]  Infowars.com, you know what it is.
[00:17:17.227 --> 00:17:24.171]  Do you think that this does Google, does Facebook, does Twitter, do they need to be regulated like, do they need to be regulated?
[00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:25.592]  Who are you?
[00:17:25.672 --> 00:17:28.394]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are, man.
[00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:33.337]  InfoWars.
[00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:35.258]  You know who InfoWars is.
[00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:36.499]  He's playing this joke over here.
[00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:38.741]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:40.262]  Here's a question.
[00:17:40.282 --> 00:17:41.203]  Don't touch me again.
[00:17:41.223 --> 00:17:42.344]  I'm asking you not to touch me.
[00:17:42.364 --> 00:17:43.064]  I'm just as bad as you.
[00:17:43.124 --> 00:17:44.085]  I know, but I don't want to be touched.
[00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:44.825]  You want me to get arrested?
[00:17:44.845 --> 00:17:45.586]  I don't know who you are.
[00:17:45.626 --> 00:17:47.127]  It's not just enough to take my First Amendment.
[00:17:47.147 --> 00:17:48.568]  It's not just enough to take my First Amendment.
[00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:49.629]  I'll take care of myself.
[00:17:49.649 --> 00:17:50.489]  Oh, he'll beat me up.
[00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.270]  I didn't say that.
[00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.311]  I know I am, but he's so mad.
[00:17:52.751 --> 00:17:54.532]  You're not going to silence me.
[00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:55.613]  You're not going to silence America.
[00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:57.735]  But there are people... You are literally like a little gangster thug.
[00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:01.657]  There are people in this country... Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me.
[00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:05.380]  There are people who feel that they are being silenced.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.882]  He tells you China's the problem, which it is, but they're taking our free speech right now.
[00:18:08.982 --> 00:18:11.844]  Social media platforms, Facebook, Twitter... There goes Rubio.
[00:18:12.184 --> 00:18:17.428]  Do you believe that these platforms need to be regulated like a public utility and how do you go about doing this?
[00:18:17.748 --> 00:18:18.929]  Well, I'd prefer not to.
[00:18:18.949 --> 00:18:20.550]  I'd prefer competition take care of that.
[00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:26.994]  But obviously, we're going to watch closely to make sure that these tools that are being used... I mean, one thing is to say we're going to go after foreign interference designed to so-and-so.
[00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:27.975]  But it's already going on here.
[00:18:28.015 --> 00:18:29.516]  Another thing is to say we're going to go after free speech.
[00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:30.377]  The Democrats are raping the Republicans.
[00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:33.039]  Because at some point, someone has to make a determination.
[00:18:33.099 --> 00:18:38.182]  What's the difference between, you know, misinformation from abroad and differences of opinion?
[00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:39.303]  Yeah, and that's happening here.
[00:18:39.323 --> 00:18:41.945]  It's a very fine line, and that's something we need to be careful about.
[00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:43.186]  We don't overreach in that direction.
[00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:44.827]  But then he doesn't know about InfoWars being banned.
[00:18:45.327 --> 00:18:46.688]  He doesn't know about the top news story in the country.
[00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:50.309]  I wonder why Rubio got so mad at me and threatened me physically.
[00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:50.449]  Huh?
[00:18:50.469 --> 00:18:50.910]  Poor Rubio.
[00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.390]  Oh, yeah.
[00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.570]  Look at this little frat boy.
[00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.231]  So cool.
[00:18:53.271 --> 00:18:54.531]  Back to your bathhouse.
[00:19:13.763 --> 00:19:14.544]  I don't like Rubio.
[00:19:14.564 --> 00:19:16.405]  I don't agree with his politics.
[00:19:16.465 --> 00:19:20.308]  But with that said, when he said, I'm not going to arrest you, I'm going to handle it myself.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.061]  I mean, if I get arrested, I'll take care of it myself.
[00:19:38.262 --> 00:19:41.363]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:19:41.924 --> 00:19:48.747]  There's got to be some sort of security there that's stopping him from actually... I mean, look, he's a member of the press.
[00:19:49.367 --> 00:19:50.007]  He's insane.
[00:19:50.228 --> 00:19:52.549]  He is insane.
[00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.370]  He is an absolute security risk.
[00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:09.518]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:31.770]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.061]  But we are taking our country back.
[00:20:40.061 --> 00:20:46.803]  If Trump is successful, if we're successful in a few years, we'll be able to say, coming to you from the recaptured United States of America.
[00:20:47.623 --> 00:21:00.067]  But the big fight you see in the incredible lies and the weaponized media is because we are facing a foreign, globalist, corporate combine allied with China, the authoritarian EU, and the traitors in Hollywood.
[00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:02.888]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:04.368]  It's in the documents.
[00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:06.589]  This is like a James Bond movie.
[00:21:07.912 --> 00:21:09.673]  The globalists are like Spectre.
[00:21:11.914 --> 00:21:18.777]  Now, there is dramatic video at Infowars.com.
[00:21:18.937 --> 00:21:22.338]  We're going to show some of you right now, if you're a TV viewer, but radio listeners must see this.
[00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:34.704]  Of thousands of camouflaged men armed with assault rifles and many on horseback
[00:21:35.882 --> 00:21:41.447]  Flooding into the United States, and this is at one ranch in Arizona.
[00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:45.450]  It's even worse in Texas.
[00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.791]  Most people have pulled out.
[00:21:46.911 --> 00:21:52.255]  You try to go ride your jet ski on a lake bordering Mexico, you get shot in the head with a sniper rifle.
[00:21:54.377 --> 00:21:57.700]  An illegal alien shoots your daughter in the back in San Francisco, the jury lets them go.
[00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:02.584]  The media made fun of the widow who saw her husband shot on the jet ski.
[00:22:04.045 --> 00:22:07.346]  Because you cannot humanize the people that are being killed.
[00:22:08.406 --> 00:22:12.347]  Mexico has collapsed into a road warrior scenario.
[00:22:13.368 --> 00:22:21.510]  So what do you do when you're the Democrats and you have a undefensible, indefensible,
[00:22:23.573 --> 00:22:25.994]  Argument of a collapsed third world country, Mexico.
[00:22:26.234 --> 00:22:27.475]  Most of it under martial law.
[00:22:27.835 --> 00:22:28.775]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:32.396]  Pouring in, you don't know who's who.
[00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:35.558]  77% of the people under 18 are unaccompanied by any family.
[00:22:35.578 --> 00:22:36.458]  You don't know who they are.
[00:22:37.998 --> 00:22:39.899]  And we're supposed to stick them in general population.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.360]  So what do they do?
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.021]  They go, oh the children, you're hurting the children.
[00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:45.761]  This little girl, you took her from her mommy.
[00:22:45.962 --> 00:22:46.922]  That was a lie too.
[00:22:47.142 --> 00:22:48.202]  She was never taken from her mother.
[00:22:48.282 --> 00:22:49.563]  It's all lies.
[00:22:52.967 --> 00:22:56.390]  And what do they do when Trump tries to secure the border?
[00:22:58.012 --> 00:22:59.553]  They say there's no violence down there.
[00:22:59.593 --> 00:23:00.434]  Everything's fine.
[00:23:00.774 --> 00:23:01.475]  We have no need.
[00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:03.117]  Well, then why do we have security at airports?
[00:23:04.858 --> 00:23:07.201]  They haven't stopped one terror attack with all that TSA crud.
[00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:08.902]  They need to profile Islamic extremists.
[00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:09.242]  Period.
[00:23:10.023 --> 00:23:10.604]  Problem solved.
[00:23:14.047 --> 00:23:15.709]  Oh, they profile conservatives.
[00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:17.891]  Facebook and all these systems discriminate against us.
[00:23:19.329 --> 00:23:21.030]  You're part of a radical sect of Islam.
[00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.950]  You're connected to these groups.
[00:23:22.711 --> 00:23:24.772]  It goes to that database and flags your butt.
[00:23:24.892 --> 00:23:26.593]  You're going to get pulled out and you're going to get questioned.
[00:23:28.254 --> 00:23:29.314]  You're going to get extra screening.
[00:23:29.614 --> 00:23:30.435]  That's what you do!
[00:23:34.517 --> 00:23:44.062]  You know, if you've been convicted of robbing a bank, and a bank gets robbed by somebody in LA that fits your description, and you're trying to fly out with a big duffel bag the next day,
[00:23:45.438 --> 00:23:47.819]  We've got probable cause to drag your ass out of there.
[00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:49.739]  I don't care if you're white, black, or polka-dotted.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.901]  Oh, but Islam is a religion of peace.
[00:23:54.041 --> 00:23:55.861]  So, that's what's happening on the border.
[00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:56.822]  It's collapsed.
[00:23:56.922 --> 00:23:59.323]  And they change the subject by screaming, you're being mean to children!
[00:24:00.683 --> 00:24:06.725]  Or, how dare you control people and not want to have a border that checks anything.
[00:24:08.456 --> 00:24:13.059]  And I was thinking about Trump when he said, a lot of great people from Mexico, a lot of great folks coming in, but we want them.
[00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:15.260]  If they're good and got a good background, aren't criminals fine?
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.482]  But there's also a lot of criminals, a lot of rapists, a lot of murderers coming across.
[00:24:18.742 --> 00:24:21.744]  That turns into, Trump calls all Mexicans murderers and rapists.
[00:24:23.786 --> 00:24:26.367]  That is total deception, and that's what they do to me and you.
[00:24:26.487 --> 00:24:27.508]  They lie about you all day.
[00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:28.909]  These people are sick.
[00:24:30.404 --> 00:24:37.229]  So I was thinking just this morning about Trump, when I watched his video again, that just came out, and I was thinking, it should have been worse what he said.
[00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:39.990]  He should have said, Mexico has collapsed in most areas.
[00:24:40.311 --> 00:24:41.471]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[00:24:42.672 --> 00:24:44.593]  It's a failed narco-terrorist state.
[00:24:44.673 --> 00:24:47.095]  We are in a red alert emergency.
[00:24:47.255 --> 00:24:49.877]  We need to defend that border right now.
[00:24:51.038 --> 00:24:51.678]  In fact, I'll say it.
[00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:55.961]  Apprehensions of illegals are up 240%.
[00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:57.422]  According to ICE, it isn't enough.
[00:24:58.823 --> 00:25:02.085]  Trump is in dereliction of duty two years in.
[00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:02.805]  He's not done enough.
[00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:06.087]  I want, and it's in the Constitution, full military.
[00:25:06.367 --> 00:25:07.048]  I want the Army.
[00:25:07.128 --> 00:25:08.068]  I want the Marine Corps.
[00:25:08.589 --> 00:25:10.850]  I want 200,000 troops on that border.
[00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.211]  I want it shut down.
[00:25:14.032 --> 00:25:15.132]  One million percent.
[00:25:17.734 --> 00:25:19.195]  All of Latin America is collapsing.
[00:25:19.555 --> 00:25:26.859]  They're building walls with razor wire all around Venezuela because Venezuela is collapsing into the surrounding countries.
[00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:31.986]  You let one of these third world countries collapse into you, you go bankrupt.
[00:25:32.386 --> 00:25:33.128]  Oh, I forgot!
[00:25:36.614 --> 00:25:37.937]  What's George Soros want?
[00:25:41.035 --> 00:25:44.097]  Before he spent tens of billions of dollars buying up the media in the U.S.
[00:25:44.137 --> 00:25:51.220]  and buying PR for himself, when I was a young man, when I was a kid and when I was in high school, my mom always had PBS on, cooking dinner.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:26:01.025]  Whenever I came home after football or whatever, she was always there at 5, 6 o'clock for like an hour and a half cooking a huge, you know, six-dish meal.
[00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:02.906]  Gourmet food.
[00:26:05.407 --> 00:26:07.568]  So I showed up for dinner a lot of times, bring my girlfriend over.
[00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:17.155]  And it was always on PBS and ABC and everywhere that George Soros is a criminal.
[00:26:17.635 --> 00:26:18.696]  He overthrows countries.
[00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:22.019]  All he wants to do is collapse things, and he's an insider trader.
[00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:23.360]  Not anymore.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.102]  He's the sweet little Nazi collaborator.
[00:26:26.302 --> 00:26:28.124]  We all must kiss his little wart-covered booty.
[00:26:29.926 --> 00:26:32.027]  So think about the fantasticness of this.
[00:26:32.407 --> 00:26:41.250]  In one ranch, thousands of men in camouflage, many on horseback with assault rifles, just unimpeded, constantly coming in.
[00:26:43.111 --> 00:26:46.432]  Rapes, murders, severed heads, all sorts of horrible garbage.
[00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:48.292]  Dead bodies buried all over the place.
[00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:52.534]  And then they say, oh, racist America!
[00:26:52.894 --> 00:26:53.574]  Open your borders!
[00:26:54.675 --> 00:26:55.675]  Oh, mean to the children!
[00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:57.055]  None of it's true.
[00:26:57.195 --> 00:26:58.776]  Think about how outrageous that is.
[00:27:01.536 --> 00:27:05.738]  How surreal it is that they use our Christian charity as deep down Americans.
[00:27:06.578 --> 00:27:07.879]  The most open country in the world.
[00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:12.541]  Where you can come here illegally and have your child, and we'll make him a citizen, and pay for everything.
[00:27:12.621 --> 00:27:13.282]  We shouldn't do that.
[00:27:14.142 --> 00:27:14.962]  Nobody else does that.
[00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.163]  And the whole world thinks of us as a joke!
[00:27:18.644 --> 00:27:20.985]  You go to China, there is no such thing as welfare.
[00:27:21.565 --> 00:27:22.146]  It's a communist.
[00:27:23.446 --> 00:27:25.587]  The liberals always think they bring in communism, they get welfare.
[00:27:25.647 --> 00:27:25.948]  No, no, no.
[00:27:25.968 --> 00:27:26.768]  You get slavery.
[00:27:29.622 --> 00:27:31.963]  You try to do anything that left us here, they kill you.
[00:27:32.003 --> 00:27:39.526]  If you're gay and you get caught, they take you and they blow your head off at a sports stadium.
[00:27:39.546 --> 00:27:44.247]  Until about five years ago, that was all on Google.
[00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:45.828]  Google took it all off.
[00:27:45.848 --> 00:27:49.529]  You could go to Google and type in Chinese executions and it'd all be there.
[00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:50.910]  Sports stadiums.
[00:27:51.917 --> 00:27:54.578]  On Saturday and Sunday for hours, it's like the entertainment.
[00:27:55.339 --> 00:27:59.201]  And everyone just comes and watches people hung and shot.
[00:28:00.341 --> 00:28:11.227]  And you can see, there was one photo of two lesbians, two 16-year-old girls that got caught in their dorm area having sex.
[00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:16.210]  And they took them out and they blew their brains all over the walls.
[00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:19.031]  Want to see those photos?
[00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:19.471]  Type it in.
[00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:23.032]  But Tim cooks gay, so it's okay.
[00:28:23.653 --> 00:28:26.493]  It's so liberal to blow women's brains all over the wall.
[00:28:26.513 --> 00:28:29.514]  If you're liberal and you're gay, then it's good.
[00:28:29.814 --> 00:28:34.876]  And the homophobe Alex Jones hates gay people because he doesn't blow their brains all over the wall.
[00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:37.797]  And he's not a Nazi collaborator like George Soros.
[00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:40.982]  Think how sick that is.
[00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:42.905]  Think how evil that is.
[00:28:43.445 --> 00:28:45.147]  And now our border's totally wide open.
[00:28:45.547 --> 00:28:48.491]  Now we've got huge news that Tucker Carlson will be covering tonight, by the way.
[00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:51.754]  That's right, we've got the man that created the walk-away campaign.
[00:28:52.435 --> 00:28:55.478]  He mentioned InfoWars and was banned on Facebook.
[00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:57.841]  Oh yes, the word police are here.
[00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:05.068]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:29:05.168 --> 00:29:13.376]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:29:13.857 --> 00:29:16.339]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:17.801]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:20.022]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:29:20.303 --> 00:29:22.404]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:29:22.664 --> 00:29:23.725]  This is all confirmed.
[00:29:23.745 --> 00:29:24.706]  This is not a drill.
[00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:28.769]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:30.550]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.130]  Apple 100%.
[00:29:31.531 --> 00:29:37.155]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:29:37.615 --> 00:29:42.339]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:43.540]  This is happening.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:51.506]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:57.550]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:29:57.951 --> 00:30:05.917]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:30:06.797 --> 00:30:10.340]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.823]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:30:14.023 --> 00:30:21.148]  And now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:30:21.388 --> 00:30:24.050]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:29.354]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:33.077]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking
[00:30:33.217 --> 00:30:40.142]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:30:51.901 --> 00:31:00.608]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:31:00.648 --> 00:31:05.512]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:10.797]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a murderer of children.
[00:31:11.277 --> 00:31:18.820]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:26.044]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:31:26.064 --> 00:31:31.886]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:36.828]  Only your full understanding of this TE will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:38.909]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.970]  Now break free!
[00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:52.416]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:31:52.996 --> 00:31:55.678]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:31:55.778 --> 00:31:59.701]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:32:01.784 --> 00:32:09.051]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:32:09.431 --> 00:32:16.978]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:20.442]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:32:21.062 --> 00:32:25.326]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:32:25.706 --> 00:32:29.629]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:32:29.829 --> 00:32:32.571]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:37.255]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:40.758]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:32:41.198 --> 00:32:56.051]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:57.592]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:32:57.812 --> 00:33:00.295]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:33:04.838 --> 00:33:07.481]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.928 --> 00:33:18.731]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:20.192]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:20.473 --> 00:33:21.613]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:22.114 --> 00:33:30.800]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.402]  I have been a busy beaver.
[00:33:35.183 --> 00:33:40.627]  And I have been talking to a lot of folks very close to the President.
[00:33:40.867 --> 00:33:42.408]  Very close to the President.
[00:33:45.196 --> 00:33:46.217]  About as close as you can get.
[00:33:47.377 --> 00:33:50.859]  And Trump's going to move on big tech very, very soon.
[00:33:50.879 --> 00:33:52.460]  And he needs to move very, very fast.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:34:07.728]  And it's just as I was told by other sources that are high level, but not as high level as this source, these sources, that Trump is being blocked and is being sabotaged by the Justice Department and the Democrats inside there and the Deep Staters.
[00:34:09.208 --> 00:34:12.953]  And that they are trying to stop him from moving against big tech censorship.
[00:34:13.254 --> 00:34:14.455]  They have a total arsenal.
[00:34:15.076 --> 00:34:20.463]  It's election meddling, it's in-kind donations to the Democrats to block all the conservatives.
[00:34:20.804 --> 00:34:25.850]  We have them blocking Republicans being able to tweet out to their constituents, but the Democrats are all
[00:34:26.491 --> 00:34:29.052]  Being given, you know, full power, pedal to the metal.
[00:34:29.592 --> 00:34:30.273]  Leaked video.
[00:34:30.373 --> 00:34:33.554]  Google leadership made reaction to Trump's election.
[00:34:34.054 --> 00:34:43.158]  Now there's video release of them swearing that they'll defeat the Republicans next time by taking full control of the public discourse and using information warfare.
[00:34:43.418 --> 00:34:44.619]  There's hours of this video.
[00:34:45.999 --> 00:34:47.500]  And by the way, more is going to come out.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.762]  See, a lot of people don't want to bring this out because they don't want to damage these institutions too bad.
[00:34:52.782 --> 00:34:54.463]  But the decision is about to be made.
[00:34:56.362 --> 00:34:59.663]  To go ahead and start bringing out the big, big dirt.
[00:35:00.324 --> 00:35:09.787]  So, if you think that Google's not going to work with the Pentagon or Congress or the American people, and then build AI for the communist Chinese, got nothing coming.
[00:35:10.187 --> 00:35:11.047]  Do we have our guest yet?
[00:35:13.268 --> 00:35:13.528]  Okay, great.
[00:35:13.588 --> 00:35:15.409]  We're going to go to him here in just a moment then.
[00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:21.671]  And the reason I mention this is, this country's in a battle for its life.
[00:35:22.947 --> 00:35:35.000]  And if the planet wants to be run by the megabanks and the chi-coms who are totally ruthless, and again, line up lesbians and blow their heads off as we just showed you Chinese executions of gays, then by all means, be for it!
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.884]  I just don't know how I get called homophobic and all this made-up crap.
[00:35:40.643 --> 00:35:50.914]  When I say you should not have people sexualizing kids, period, and they have the LGBT group saying I'm a homophobe, when it's Apple working with China that literally murders gay people.
[00:35:51.455 --> 00:35:54.478]  And I'm not saying that because our next guest is gay.
[00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:57.762]  It's a fact of insane hypocrisy!
[00:35:59.204 --> 00:36:00.205]  It drives me crazy!
[00:36:00.906 --> 00:36:02.047]  Sorry, we'll go to our guest here in a moment.
[00:36:06.246 --> 00:36:10.167]  Heavily armed individuals caught on camera entering country illegally through Arizona.
[00:36:10.187 --> 00:36:10.867]  We'll get more into that.
[00:36:11.368 --> 00:36:12.728]  We'll get into the leaked video.
[00:36:12.808 --> 00:36:14.228]  Google leadership dismayed.
[00:36:14.288 --> 00:36:15.509]  Reaction to Trump election.
[00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:17.309]  And then all, there's hours of this.
[00:36:17.369 --> 00:36:17.910]  It's incredible.
[00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.450]  This is the leaders of Google.
[00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.871]  Like a bunch of little wimps crying.
[00:36:22.731 --> 00:36:24.872]  Shocking information.
[00:36:25.412 --> 00:36:25.992]  Exclusive.
[00:36:26.052 --> 00:36:27.853]  Jim Jordan on leaked Google video.
[00:36:28.033 --> 00:36:30.213]  Anti-conservative bias rampant across Silicon Valley.
[00:36:30.493 --> 00:36:31.334]  Vows to take action.
[00:36:31.514 --> 00:36:33.414]  The EU just passed a law banning memes.
[00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:34.395]  I'm not kidding.
[00:36:34.415 --> 00:36:35.175]  Just even sending them.
[00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:38.442]  So that's all coming up.
[00:36:41.904 --> 00:36:44.305]  And again, we're going to be going to Brandon Strzok here in a moment.
[00:36:44.345 --> 00:36:52.049]  His Skype has been cutting in and out, and he just got frozen for 30 days on Facebook for saying, hey, Patriots, I'm about to go on InfoWars.
[00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.132]  And again, they're trying to tell you what you can and can't read, what you can and can't see.
[00:36:57.452 --> 00:37:01.515]  And Big Tech, because they have a monopoly, believes that they can get past the Streisand effect.
[00:37:01.555 --> 00:37:02.535]  This is a big test of that.
[00:37:03.796 --> 00:37:03.916]  Now,
[00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.852]  Let me tell you something that's very important while we're getting our guest on.
[00:37:16.453 --> 00:37:16.973]  And it's this.
[00:37:18.474 --> 00:37:21.835]  Just like our information here on air is world changing.
[00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:33.461]  Just like our information is powerful.
[00:37:39.853 --> 00:37:41.674]  Our products are the same.
[00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:54.904]  And, you know, I don't just sit here and tell you that... I can't... They had their mic up, excuse me.
[00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:57.566]  A lot of stuff going on here behind the scenes.
[00:38:00.948 --> 00:38:05.832]  Now, just like our information is game-changing,
[00:38:09.744 --> 00:38:10.864]  Our products are game-changing.
[00:38:12.225 --> 00:38:14.566]  If you don't have oxygen, you die.
[00:38:14.686 --> 00:38:16.126]  I know they'll say that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:38:16.326 --> 00:38:17.487]  If you don't have water, you'll die.
[00:38:18.427 --> 00:38:19.548]  In a week, generally.
[00:38:21.168 --> 00:38:26.250]  If you don't have iodine, you die.
[00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:28.711]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[00:38:31.206 --> 00:38:34.889]  Now vitamin C is very abundant and very plentiful and very easy to get.
[00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:41.813]  Iodine in the environment isn't and it's bound to other things when you get it from seaweed or you get it in salt.
[00:38:42.294 --> 00:38:43.935]  It's not with X2.
[00:38:48.078 --> 00:38:58.065]  It is in palm oil solution and it's put in in a gaseous form in a patented system.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.301]  And then what it does in the body is something you got to experience for yourself.
[00:39:07.702 --> 00:39:10.762]  You need to experience it and read the thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:17.884]  98% on Power Reviews, 97% on other major sites, 6,000 plus reviews, 4.9 stars.
[00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:20.025]  Experience it.
[00:39:20.145 --> 00:39:22.125]  It's unlike any other iodine out there.
[00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:25.046]  It doesn't give me stomach aches, doesn't make people sick.
[00:39:25.346 --> 00:39:28.147]  The other iodine is very toxic and eat holes in your stomach.
[00:39:29.517 --> 00:39:30.978]  Consult your physician before you take this.
[00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:33.660]  I mix it with water, or I take it right under the tongue.
[00:39:34.921 --> 00:39:36.883]  And it is mooey powerful.
[00:39:38.164 --> 00:39:44.589]  So I would take a half a dose at first, and usually about three weeks in, people detox, and it's not too fun.
[00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:55.338]  For about four or five days, and then it's like, you ever been carrying one of your kids on your shoulders, or you're carrying a big backpack, and you go up a big hill, and when you finally get to the top of the hill, and take the backpack off, it feels like you're flying?
[00:39:56.579 --> 00:39:57.760]  About a month after I took X2,
[00:39:59.164 --> 00:39:59.224]  I'm
[00:40:19.161 --> 00:40:19.821]  The good halogen.
[00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:24.124]  Instead, the bad halogens fill your glands, and you see all the problems and issues out there.
[00:40:24.164 --> 00:40:25.865]  So experience iodine for yourself.
[00:40:26.325 --> 00:40:34.070]  They give you the bad halogen, fluoride in the water, and bromine and chlorine, other bad halogens, on record, that lower IQs.
[00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.111]  Well, survival shield does the opposite.
[00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:37.152]  Don't believe me?
[00:40:37.172 --> 00:40:47.778]  Just type in, studies show iodine supplementation, even with the cheap bound type, increased IQs by 15 points when given to children.
[00:40:49.565 --> 00:40:51.547]  That's right.
[00:40:51.567 --> 00:40:54.770]  15 point IQ increase.
[00:40:56.111 --> 00:41:00.775]  You know, Secret 12 is really pure, high quality methylcobalamin B12.
[00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:07.842]  And it gives me some energy to take it.
[00:41:09.944 --> 00:41:12.066]  X2, though, is amazing.
[00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.772]  Sometimes I forget to take it, because I've never been a big supplement guy, for like a week.
[00:41:15.792 --> 00:41:17.052]  And then I go, why do I feel so tired?
[00:41:17.072 --> 00:41:17.913]  I go, oh, X2.
[00:41:18.733 --> 00:41:20.374]  And I take my X2.
[00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:26.237]  So again, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:26.477 --> 00:41:28.458]  And I told you this about six months ago.
[00:41:28.518 --> 00:41:35.022]  I said, we may not be able to get X2 anymore, because it comes from the gas drilling, oil drilling companies, between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[00:41:35.062 --> 00:41:35.962]  They run under the crystals.
[00:41:37.023 --> 00:41:40.725]  And once they figure it out, there's a market for it, other than
[00:41:41.605 --> 00:41:44.927]  What they do with pharmaceuticals, a lot of pharmaceuticals are made with iodine as a precursor.
[00:41:45.188 --> 00:41:48.150]  That's why raw gas-based iodine is a controlled substance.
[00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.232]  We've got to have a lab with a DEA license and all this other stuff.
[00:41:51.552 --> 00:41:53.913]  Once it's in the palm oil, it's not a drug.
[00:41:54.814 --> 00:41:59.497]  But the point is that this is a big hassle to get.
[00:42:00.057 --> 00:42:00.858]  It is a hassle.
[00:42:01.759 --> 00:42:02.719]  That's why no one else has it.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.743]  And so we're really working hard to try to continue to get it, but there's no contract now.
[00:42:11.178 --> 00:42:11.598]  Six months?
[00:42:11.638 --> 00:42:12.379]  A year until we get more?
[00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:12.899]  I don't know.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.060]  But it is a bummer.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.181]  I'm still discounting it 25%.
[00:42:16.321 --> 00:42:21.404]  Despite that, so everybody can experience it and just know how great iodine is.
[00:42:21.424 --> 00:42:26.827]  Because if you can't get this, hey, seaweed is good.
[00:42:27.007 --> 00:42:27.848]  Just make sure it's a clean one.
[00:42:28.768 --> 00:42:31.430]  It's nothing like this, but it's the next best thing.
[00:42:32.425 --> 00:42:36.288]  And there's some Himalayan salts and sea salts that have some of it as well.
[00:42:36.308 --> 00:42:39.610]  But a lot of times, again, it's bound into other metals and things that are in the water.
[00:42:39.671 --> 00:42:41.872]  And a lot of sea salt has mercury and crap in it.
[00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:42.753]  This is totally clean.
[00:42:42.773 --> 00:42:46.315]  Nothing but palm oil and the purest iodine.
[00:42:46.776 --> 00:42:48.057]  I mean, this stuff is amazing.
[00:42:48.517 --> 00:42:50.038]  And it is the last run of X2.
[00:42:50.078 --> 00:42:52.640]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.243]  Now, the thought police are now banning the term InfoWars.
[00:42:57.323 --> 00:42:57.764]  Straight ahead.
[00:42:57.784 --> 00:42:58.084]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:11.787]  Whether you're... Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[00:43:11.827 --> 00:43:17.268]  The social networking site permanently banning he and his media company, InfoWars.
[00:43:17.409 --> 00:43:19.649]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure.
[00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:25.110]  Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:28.451]  Embrace wild conspiracy theories like...
[00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.030]  Those surrounding Benghazi.
[00:43:31.391 --> 00:43:31.851]  You heard it.
[00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:32.891]  Benghazi.
[00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:34.592]  A wild conspiracy.
[00:43:34.632 --> 00:43:43.094]  In a blistering speech, former President Obama blasting the GOP over the Benghazi probe while he was in office, calling it a conspiracy theory.
[00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:48.856]  Again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and then something sprang out of that and assault sprang out of that.
[00:43:49.396 --> 00:43:53.237]  And that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact.
[00:43:53.457 --> 00:43:55.518]  And the American people could have known that within days.
[00:43:55.718 --> 00:43:58.199]  What difference at this point does it make
[00:43:58.479 --> 00:43:59.039]  Former U.S.
[00:43:59.139 --> 00:44:04.462]  Army Ranger Chris Tonto-Pronto was a CIA security contractor guarding the Benghazi annex.
[00:44:04.482 --> 00:44:05.442]  He joins us now.
[00:44:06.003 --> 00:44:06.923]  Chris, thanks for being here.
[00:44:07.043 --> 00:44:07.843]  You hear those words.
[00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:08.624]  Your reaction?
[00:44:08.844 --> 00:44:14.807]  It's completely offensive and it's something that I wish I had that man sitting in front of me right now.
[00:44:14.947 --> 00:44:15.467]  I really do.
[00:44:16.107 --> 00:44:17.128]  Without his Secret Service.
[00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:20.889]  Well, we'll be careful with that because he's a friend of the President.
[00:44:21.089 --> 00:44:25.231]  Twitter suspends Benghazi hero after criticism of the President who left him there to die.
[00:44:25.251 --> 00:44:26.452]  Basically tried to kill him.
[00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:38.581]  And if you talk to the person that killed your friends and tried to kill you and got caught lying about it, then you are the monster, you are the bad guy.
[00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:39.982]  That is truly sick.
[00:44:40.982 --> 00:44:42.263]  And now they've banned him.
[00:44:42.683 --> 00:44:49.025]  Well, we remember those men and what they did for this country, that sacrifice and heroism there in Benghazi.
[00:44:49.045 --> 00:44:50.605]  Thank you for your service to this country.
[00:44:50.905 --> 00:44:51.666]  Chris, appreciate your time.
[00:44:51.686 --> 00:44:52.886]  We'll remember you this week.
[00:45:08.781 --> 00:45:10.903]  Let's go to Jason in New Mexico.
[00:45:10.983 --> 00:45:11.463]  Fire away.
[00:45:11.483 --> 00:45:12.624]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:45:12.644 --> 00:45:15.426]  Shout out to you, the crew, and all those that work behind the scenes.
[00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:26.394]  And I would tell everybody to commit to the super blue toothpaste and the Survival Shield X2 so you don't turn into a transsexual, gay toad, and run as a... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:45:27.915 --> 00:45:30.916]  Hey, I just came out as a transsexual gay toad.
[00:45:31.016 --> 00:45:34.777]  I'm not going to have you slander my people before I run for office as a Democrat.
[00:45:34.877 --> 00:45:41.439]  I know that's right, but really, we should contribute to you guys because I've been given for years and I've seen the production value just skyrocket.
[00:45:41.479 --> 00:45:45.840]  I mean, your graphics team, just the content in general, everything is going great.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:52.382]  And at the same time, there's no better organization that I could give my dollars to, to see it at work on a daily basis.
[00:45:52.682 --> 00:45:56.243]  Well, and we appreciate you, Jason, and that's why we try to give you the best products.
[00:45:56.263 --> 00:45:58.784]  You know, we just don't put something out there and say, hey, please buy it.
[00:45:58.864 --> 00:46:03.105]  We do the research and then actually put out the best possible product.
[00:46:03.185 --> 00:46:06.126]  In the five years of my support, I have never bought a bad product.
[00:46:06.166 --> 00:46:12.827]  And I waste a lot of money on, you know, you go to one of these big box stores, you buy a piece of crap, and the psychologist throw away $10.
[00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:16.108]  You throw $10 at that toothpaste, guarantee it won't be a waste.
[00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:18.749]  Especially if you love your kids, why would you give them fluoride?
[00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:20.350]  Yeah, yeah, just go look.
[00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.011]  You know, here's what I would say to the audience.
[00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:30.339]  If you're not using super blue fluoride toothpaste, go home and look at the toothpaste that you're using, and on the back of it, it will say, harmful if swallowed.
[00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:36.384]  Contact poison control for 0.01% of fluoride.
[00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:38.306]  0.01, harmful if swallowed.
[00:46:38.446 --> 00:46:39.607]  They put that in the water.
[00:46:39.647 --> 00:46:41.008]  Yep, that's if you love the kids, though.
[00:46:41.028 --> 00:46:42.770]  Hey, I'm not telling you how to spend your money.
[00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.470]  Yeah, you know what, good point.
[00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.592]  If you don't love your kids, just keep giving them the fluoride.
[00:46:45.612 --> 00:46:46.113]  Yeah, that's fine.
[00:46:47.713 --> 00:46:53.436]  No matter what the globalists want to do, no matter what politicians want to do, this country is going to make it!
[00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:58.238]  The War Room.
[00:46:58.318 --> 00:47:00.959]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:05.841 --> 00:47:08.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:43.272]  We're 54 days out from the most important election in world history.
[00:47:43.452 --> 00:47:44.312]  All the experts agree.
[00:47:44.332 --> 00:47:46.053]  I've been saying it for a couple years.
[00:47:48.675 --> 00:47:55.599]  And they're trying to ban us, not because we lie, but because we're effective and we love America and we love prosperity and we love freedom and the tyrants don't like that.
[00:47:57.711 --> 00:48:01.593]  A little bird told me that Brandon Strzok is going to be on Tucker Carlson tonight.
[00:48:02.574 --> 00:48:02.974]  That's good.
[00:48:02.994 --> 00:48:09.837]  You know, I personally tried to get Strzok hooked up with the President and Turning Point USA because he's very well spoken.
[00:48:10.198 --> 00:48:12.719]  His movement is on fire for several months.
[00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:16.241]  And he's very, very, very patriotic.
[00:48:17.041 --> 00:48:18.762]  And he's got a big rally coming up.
[00:48:18.882 --> 00:48:20.223]  Well, he was on a few days ago.
[00:48:21.938 --> 00:48:28.300]  And within an hour of him putting on Facebook that he would be on the Alex Jones Show, so tune in Patriots.
[00:48:29.241 --> 00:48:29.561]  Boom!
[00:48:29.721 --> 00:48:32.862]  He was banned for 30 days, which again is election meddling.
[00:48:32.902 --> 00:48:33.942]  They're doing it everywhere.
[00:48:34.342 --> 00:48:39.984]  We have the internal leaked video of Google after Hillary lost saying this will never happen again, we will stop this.
[00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:41.765]  I'm going to read the quotes later.
[00:48:42.385 --> 00:48:43.866]  They talk about how they will control reality.
[00:48:45.286 --> 00:48:49.368]  It's an amazing time to be alive, but here's Tucker Carlson talking about it last night.
[00:48:49.428 --> 00:48:49.768]  Here it is.
[00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:54.991]  Well, Alex Jones has been banned from all tech platforms.
[00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:58.372]  Nobody said anything, so big text-language police are getting bolder.
[00:48:58.872 --> 00:49:06.194]  According to the Center for Immigration Studies, Twitter refused to let the organization promote one of its tweets because it included the phrase, illegal aliens.
[00:49:06.274 --> 00:49:07.714]  That's verboten, not allowed.
[00:49:08.274 --> 00:49:14.976]  Of course, illegal aliens was routinely used by the Obama administration to describe aliens illegally within the United States.
[00:49:15.996 --> 00:49:20.859]  Twitter, once caught, now says the block was a mistake and has been corrected.
[00:49:22.781 --> 00:49:23.421]  Yeah, right.
[00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:29.005]  And then, again, they get into Strzok more later, and then tonight I'm told this is going to be their top story.
[00:49:29.325 --> 00:49:36.590]  This is a big deal, because Strzok is well-spoken, nice guy, very G-rated, I'd say.
[00:49:37.871 --> 00:49:43.215]  He's not bombastic like I am, and boom, you don't share info, or so now words.
[00:49:44.454 --> 00:49:51.299]  Even though the Silicon Valley meeting that was secret two weeks ago admitted they were calling it information warfare against us.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.462]  I chose the term InfoWars because that's what we're in.
[00:49:54.862 --> 00:49:55.803]  When I set up InfoWars in 1996.
[00:49:55.903 --> 00:49:59.146]  Who is says 1999.
[00:49:59.186 --> 00:50:01.287]  That's when it was transferred to another domain.
[00:50:02.448 --> 00:50:04.949]  So joining us is Brandon Strzok for this segment and the next.
[00:50:05.749 --> 00:50:12.432]  And I did hear from a little bird that they were trying to get you on, Tucker, and I don't know if you've had that call, but if not, I can give you their number.
[00:50:12.692 --> 00:50:18.394]  Because this is obviously really, really important, Brandon, that we get this out, because it's just an avalanche of censorship.
[00:50:18.735 --> 00:50:22.476]  And finally, 54 days out, it looks like the President's starting to figure it out.
[00:50:22.716 --> 00:50:27.078]  So thanks for joining us, and I'm going to be at your march, and tell folks the latest developments.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.066]  Alex, if you can hear me, I cut out there for a bit.
[00:50:33.106 --> 00:50:33.347]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:33.367 --> 00:50:34.188]  Could I get the question again?
[00:50:34.208 --> 00:50:34.469]  It's okay.
[00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:35.872]  I know we've had some Skype problems today.
[00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:36.934]  No, it's just good to have you here.
[00:50:36.974 --> 00:50:37.936]  Tell folks what happened to you.
[00:50:39.127 --> 00:50:45.832]  Yeah, so I was promoting my walkway march on Washington and came on your show a couple of days ago.
[00:50:45.872 --> 00:50:46.772]  Thank you for having me on.
[00:50:47.533 --> 00:50:52.996]  And I like to keep the people in the walkway campaign apprised of everything that's going on.
[00:50:53.056 --> 00:50:59.961]  So anytime I do any media of any kind, I make a note to say, hey, Patriots, I'm going on such and such a show, and be sure to tune in.
[00:51:00.501 --> 00:51:06.105]  I literally wrote the post, hey, Patriots, I'll be live on InfoWars in 15 minutes.
[00:51:06.405 --> 00:51:07.186]  Be sure to tune in.
[00:51:07.961 --> 00:51:11.184]  And I got a 30-day ban from Facebook for writing that.
[00:51:13.646 --> 00:51:16.729]  And that's what Paul Watson was told by high-level folks at Twitter.
[00:51:16.749 --> 00:51:20.093]  I haven't really talked about this yet, but he's got some fans over at Twitter.
[00:51:21.734 --> 00:51:26.459]  And they were in the meeting with Dorsey, and we actually know why it was banned.
[00:51:26.679 --> 00:51:29.802]  It wasn't bullying the CNN reporter who bullies me.
[00:51:30.582 --> 00:51:30.923]  It was
[00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:33.892]  Possibly not.
[00:51:33.912 --> 00:51:36.773]  But I mean, this is, uh, it's happening all the time.
[00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.995]  And I think what, it's so interesting, like you said,
[00:51:56.164 --> 00:51:58.510]  My post wasn't even an opinion.
[00:51:58.891 --> 00:52:02.579]  I mean, there was nothing even slightly controversial, provocative.
[00:52:02.599 --> 00:52:05.406]  I was literally just plugging an interview.
[00:52:06.027 --> 00:52:09.928]  You know, so I mean, at this point, it's literally just naming a name or saying a word.
[00:52:10.648 --> 00:52:16.270]  And I mean, also, let's be honest, I'm also, you know, putting on the the walkaway march on Washington.
[00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:19.851]  I doubt that every person who's saying the word InfoWars or Alex Jones is getting banned.
[00:52:20.231 --> 00:52:26.813]  But I think that they found this as a convenient excuse to get rid of me for 30 days and try to sabotage my ability to plan the march.
[00:52:28.803 --> 00:52:41.748]  Now, there's a military tactic that they started doing in World War I, the Germans did, and then the Allies adopted it, where they would bullhorn, we're not attacking, this is not an assault, peace has been declared, put your hands up.
[00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:58.055]  And they found enough people would get addled by it, at least listen to it, that they wouldn't aim their howitzers, they wouldn't aim their rifles, their machine guns, their water-cooled machine guns, and it would just cause disarray, and a few people would panic and go, they're friends, they want to be, and they'd, you know, get killed.
[00:52:58.935 --> 00:53:02.478]  And it's the same thing here, where they go, no one's censoring you, nothing's happening.
[00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:03.940]  They've been doing that for two years.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.544]  Now it's total, and so they're like, okay, we are banning all of you, what are you going to do about it?
[00:53:08.844 --> 00:53:13.288]  And then Google says, we're not going to work with the Pentagon anymore, we're moving to China to help their military with AI.
[00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:14.369]  That was two months ago.
[00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:18.553]  It is belligerent criminal activity by these groups.
[00:53:18.774 --> 00:53:20.996]  This is not just censorship, it is an information
[00:53:21.616 --> 00:53:22.157]  Takeover.
[00:53:22.257 --> 00:53:23.718]  It is an information monopoly.
[00:53:23.778 --> 00:53:25.159]  It is election meddling.
[00:53:25.459 --> 00:53:33.446]  And while they've got us looking at the Russians that literally can hardly tie their shoes when it comes to election meddling, Facebook, Google, and all of them are gaming everything.
[00:53:33.526 --> 00:53:35.388]  What do you think Trump should do about this?
[00:53:36.744 --> 00:53:39.447]  Well, I think that at this point, you know, we need to step in.
[00:53:39.487 --> 00:53:40.468]  I think it's not just Trump.
[00:53:40.508 --> 00:53:44.171]  I think that any of us who are on the conservative side need to sort of band together.
[00:53:44.211 --> 00:53:49.356]  This needs to be an issue that we all stand strong together on going forward, and we take this issue up.
[00:53:49.396 --> 00:53:51.217]  I don't know if this means an Internet Bill of Rights.
[00:53:51.618 --> 00:53:59.145]  I don't know exactly what this means, but I think that this is something that the conservative movement as a whole, we need to band together and make this an issue that we press for going forward together.
[00:54:00.265 --> 00:54:03.186]  Well, that's right, because we hear about foreign countries meddling.
[00:54:04.046 --> 00:54:13.408]  Russia doesn't have 1-100th the power of all the big tech heads that met and are in the emails saying, we're going to deliver the election to Hillary like we did to Obama.
[00:54:13.728 --> 00:54:16.209]  We're going to suppress and censor conservatives.
[00:54:16.509 --> 00:54:17.629]  We're going to shadow ban them.
[00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:19.529]  They're never going to know why.
[00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:21.390]  We have them on video saying it about me.
[00:54:22.566 --> 00:54:26.172]  At Google, and at the New York Times, that works with them to censor me.
[00:54:26.652 --> 00:54:30.759]  So, they're now doing it to you, it's a concerted, racketeering, organized crime.
[00:54:30.779 --> 00:54:33.723]  And those aren't words, that's what they're doing!
[00:54:35.447 --> 00:54:46.192]  Well, it's just remarkable to me that they, like, who are these people to decide for everybody else what other people can and cannot hear, what they can and cannot see, and what they're allowed to know or not know.
[00:54:46.632 --> 00:54:56.757]  I mean, it's so fascinating to me that the name Alex Jones or InfoWars is so dangerous and threatening that anybody needs to be banned if they even say that name.
[00:54:57.097 --> 00:55:02.300]  Yet people on the left 10,000 times a day use the word Hitler when speaking about our president.
[00:55:03.055 --> 00:55:04.176]  That's not a problem for them.
[00:55:04.817 --> 00:55:09.361]  So I mean, the word Infowars or Alex Jones is obviously more dangerous in their mind than Hitler.
[00:55:10.302 --> 00:55:15.246]  I was trying to wrap my mind around it yesterday when I found out this happened to you because this is thought police, it's word police.
[00:55:15.867 --> 00:55:21.432]  And so if Alex Jones becomes the new N-word or Infowars becomes the new N-word, it could be any other word they want.
[00:55:21.472 --> 00:55:24.094]  And I was thinking about how Kafka-esque or Orwellian
[00:55:25.443 --> 00:55:32.805]  That is and and and really they've succeeded at doing this in China So people keep thinking this is crazy the Streisand effect.
[00:55:33.505 --> 00:55:53.309]  They really believe they're gonna get away with this and That's why I'm so concerned because this is this is so over-the-top It's so surreal I'm actually speechless that now they're saying you can't say Alex Jones or say Impel Wars That is that is just next next level
[00:55:54.505 --> 00:56:03.872]  Right, but you know, in this weird way, it's almost good that it happened to me, I think, and it's good that it happened in this way, because like you said earlier in the show, you know, I'm not really a controversial guy.
[00:56:03.972 --> 00:56:05.233]  I'm not really a provocateur.
[00:56:05.253 --> 00:56:06.774]  That's certainly not my public image.
[00:56:07.354 --> 00:56:12.538]  You know, I'm just literally kind of a person who's trying to run this walkaway campaign.
[00:56:12.998 --> 00:56:15.180]  I don't go on the air saying outrageous opinions.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.881]  I don't go out there saying shocking things.
[00:56:17.481 --> 00:56:21.064]  For this to happen to me, and literally just over a word.
[00:56:21.664 --> 00:56:23.045]  I wasn't even stating an opinion.
[00:56:23.065 --> 00:56:27.228]  I was literally just advising people that I was doing an interview on InfoWars.
[00:56:27.448 --> 00:56:31.470]  So this just goes to show the level at which they're willing to reach to do this.
[00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:33.131]  It's outrageous.
[00:56:33.312 --> 00:56:42.638]  I mean, there's literally no good explanation for it other than the fact that they're trying to sabotage me and my mission, and they are literally trying to erase your existence completely.
[00:56:43.294 --> 00:56:56.219]  I was talking to some folks high level in the Pentagon a few weeks ago, and I said, Alex, we don't have the total numbers, but basically Soros, when he collapsed more than 20 countries, isn't just worth $50 billion.
[00:56:56.299 --> 00:56:58.460]  He reportedly is worth hundreds of billions.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.641]  He's probably one of the richest people in the world.
[00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:08.595]  And they said, son, he's got over $170 million on the street against you we've tracked.
[00:57:09.196 --> 00:57:15.080]  So a lot of this is, I just got under his skin, his son is now taking over and really hates me, and I have called him names.
[00:57:15.521 --> 00:57:15.901]  It's true.
[00:57:15.921 --> 00:57:21.765]  And a lot of this is just their total vengeance, and I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[00:57:21.785 --> 00:57:22.186]  What do you think?
[00:57:23.086 --> 00:57:26.907]  Well, I think it's going to blow up in their face, too, because what's actually happening... I panicked yesterday.
[00:57:26.927 --> 00:57:27.727]  I really did panic.
[00:57:27.747 --> 00:57:29.207]  We're trying to plan this march on Washington.
[00:57:29.227 --> 00:57:30.667]  It's going to cost us half a million dollars.
[00:57:31.067 --> 00:57:37.949]  But what's actually happened is it's sort of energized and bolstered everybody to want to help out, get the word out about the walkway march on Washington.
[00:57:38.269 --> 00:57:39.809]  I think it's going to blow up in their face completely.
[00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:40.169]  I agree.
[00:57:40.289 --> 00:57:40.529]  All right.
[00:57:40.569 --> 00:57:44.230]  Back in 70 seconds, I want you to finish up about the march, how folks get involved.
[00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:45.030]  You're still on Twitter.
[00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:46.750]  You've got your own website.
[00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:47.990]  We need to give that out.
[00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:49.131]  We'll give that out in a moment.
[00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:50.631]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:51.051]  Stay with us.
[00:57:51.804 --> 00:58:03.718]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[00:58:04.258 --> 00:58:10.565]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[00:58:11.286 --> 00:58:17.629]  To begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:24.173]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[00:58:24.473 --> 00:58:29.195]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[00:58:29.556 --> 00:58:31.837]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:31.877 --> 00:58:34.798]  But every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[00:58:35.139 --> 00:58:37.660]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.221]  Obama established...
[00:58:39.861 --> 00:58:43.242]  With an executive order, a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:47.703]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist, popular groups.
[00:58:48.584 --> 00:58:57.847]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:05.469]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:20.442]  Just like communist China, this is dangerous authoritarianism, and they've packaged silencing Americans who are popular and well-spoken, as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News, not because what I say is bad, but because what I say is effective and true and popular.
[00:59:20.702 --> 00:59:29.510]  But I think the corporate dying dinosaur media has bit off more than it can chew, and what you've done is only going to make people be that much stronger and fight for free speech that much more.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:30.630]  But I'll say this.
[00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:32.911]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media.
[00:59:33.232 --> 00:59:42.996]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:57.830]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:59:58.210 --> 00:59:59.710]  You are the resistance.
[01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.471]  We've got it.
[01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:10.393]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.554]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:16.735]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.835 --> 01:00:20.476]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:27.513 --> 01:00:29.077]  You got it.
[01:00:37.806 --> 01:00:43.089]  Okay, Brandon Strzok is leading the hashtag walkaway movement.
[01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:46.871]  We're going to put his website on screen, walkawaymarch.com.
[01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:51.935]  Now that URL isn't banned yet, so get it out there, walkawaymarch.com.
[01:00:53.336 --> 01:01:00.220]  Again, that's why Drudge came here two years ago and said, we've got to have our own websites, we've got to use Alex, pull out of Twitter and Facebook now as your main base.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.461]  They're going to ban you.
[01:01:01.481 --> 01:01:06.104]  He was told by the other conservative Supreme Court Justice, not the one that died.
[01:01:07.449 --> 01:01:10.513]  So, we've only got four more minutes left with you.
[01:01:10.553 --> 01:01:11.875]  Please start coming back on a regular basis.
[01:01:11.895 --> 01:01:12.476]  I know you're busy.
[01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:14.038]  Sorry I had Skype problems earlier.
[01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:18.904]  Tell folks about the march coming up, again, what happened to you, this next level of draconian behavior.
[01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:25.147]  Well, so yes, we have a walk-away march on Washington that we're planning October 26th through the 28th.
[01:01:25.187 --> 01:01:26.568]  That's a Friday through a Sunday.
[01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.934]  It's going to start off with a gala dinner at the Trump International Hotel.
[01:01:31.974 --> 01:01:33.596]  It's going to be a really, really incredible event.
[01:01:33.616 --> 01:01:38.421]  We're expecting some big-name speakers and just a really, really great, amazing event to kick the weekend off.
[01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:39.723]  They've got amazing stakes there.
[01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:43.536]  Yes, and then on Saturday is the main event.
[01:01:44.337 --> 01:01:45.977]  It's the march culminating in the rally.
[01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:48.718]  We're going to be marching from the DNC in Washington, D.C.
[01:01:48.758 --> 01:01:49.739]  to our nation's capitol.
[01:01:49.759 --> 01:01:52.980]  So we are walking away from the Democratic Party to the nation's capitol.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:58.222]  Once again, we're going to have incredible speakers there in a big rally there in the front lawn in front of the capitol building.
[01:01:58.262 --> 01:01:59.403]  It's going to be stunning and amazing.
[01:01:59.423 --> 01:02:01.224]  We'll have some entertainment afterwards.
[01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:06.586]  And then the next day is Sunday, the 28th, and we're going to have a closing brunch and give people the day to travel home.
[01:02:07.146 --> 01:02:14.010]  So, this is obviously a pretty massive undertaking, and it's something we wanted to do strategically before the midterms to really make a powerful statement.
[01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:26.357]  One of the things, we want all Americans to walk away from the Democratic Party and liberalism, but we really, really want these minority groups who are taken advantage of to really wake up and pay attention to what, you know, the mainstream media and what the Democratic Party is doing.
[01:02:26.757 --> 01:02:32.240]  So I envision this massive event where we have tens of thousands of African Americans, tens of thousands of Hispanics, and
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:41.391]  LGBT people as well as every other type of person walking away from the Democratic Party so that everybody including these minority groups can see this is where something's going on.
[01:02:41.452 --> 01:02:44.215]  You need to be walking away and paying attention and that you're not alone.
[01:02:44.856 --> 01:02:49.302]  You know, there are groups of people who are walking away with you and you can do this with them.
[01:02:49.922 --> 01:02:50.563]  I think we're good.
[01:03:09.155 --> 01:03:10.256]  For the next 30 days.
[01:03:10.677 --> 01:03:14.761]  My team and I are working on a workaround so that I can get my communication back and forth with them.
[01:03:15.101 --> 01:03:20.467]  We're trying to raise half a million dollars in the next... And by the way, people don't know why I don't do events.
[01:03:20.587 --> 01:03:28.796]  If you even try to get something, say, at the Sheraton in LA, not even the nicest hotel, you know, just decent, you want a 2,000-person ballroom and then the security and everything.
[01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:36.063]  You know, it's like $200,000, and then you've got to charge people $100, and they think you're ripping them off, and then you lose money.
[01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:44.590]  Because you've got to have security, and you've got to have this, and you've got to have that, and then all of a sudden the hotel goes, we're going to cancel because of threats we've had, unless you spend more money on security.
[01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:50.795]  So, I know for a fact, I haven't done DC marches, because exactly, they've told me it's a half million dollars to do what you're doing.
[01:03:51.556 --> 01:04:00.288]  Right, well, yeah, I mean, it's just like you said, there's permitting, there's security, you know, yes, there's so, so much that goes into it, not to mention advertising, branding, getting all this stuff out there.
[01:04:00.728 --> 01:04:03.051]  But I'm actually not too concerned about it.
[01:04:03.091 --> 01:04:07.237]  I mean, if I have the ability to communicate with my people, we're doing a great job fundraising at this point.
[01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:12.218]  If anybody would like to contribute, they can go to walkwaymarch.com and please click fundraising.
[01:04:12.319 --> 01:04:13.639]  It'll take you to our GoFundMe.
[01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:19.961]  Of course, we're always looking for any kind of sponsors or donations from people who are at a larger level if they're able to.
[01:04:20.381 --> 01:04:22.662]  But I'm telling you, I was devastated yesterday, Alex.
[01:04:22.722 --> 01:04:25.843]  I mean, I was ready to shut the march down entirely because I thought
[01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:29.766]  How the hell are we going to pull this off if I can't communicate with my people?
[01:04:30.126 --> 01:04:32.328]  Like I said, my team and I have kind of worked on a workaround.
[01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.609]  We think it's going to be okay.
[01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:35.211]  But this is what they're trying to do.
[01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:40.955]  They're trying to get people like me who are trying to have a voice and make a difference to cower and say, you know what?
[01:04:41.136 --> 01:04:42.457]  I'm not as... They're bigger than me.
[01:04:42.517 --> 01:04:43.357]  They're stronger than me.
[01:04:43.798 --> 01:04:44.598]  I might as well quit.
[01:04:44.659 --> 01:04:47.161]  I might as well give up because how can I fight against them?
[01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:49.302]  Well, I'm not going to quit and I'm not going to give up.
[01:04:49.383 --> 01:04:50.223]  I'm going to keep marching on.
[01:04:50.283 --> 01:04:50.904]  I'm going to fight back.
[01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:53.425]  Wow, you are definitely on fire.
[01:04:53.445 --> 01:04:54.245]  This is so exciting.
[01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.586]  walkawaymarch.com.
[01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:57.346]  Brandon Strzok, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:04:57.706 --> 01:04:59.427]  And absolutely, Streisand Effect is happening.
[01:04:59.447 --> 01:04:59.927]  God bless you.
[01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:00.588]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:02.568 --> 01:05:07.810]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.

[01:05:12.692 --> 01:05:19.975]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[01:05:20.735 --> 01:05:27.080]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:49.795]  Horny goatweed from China.
[01:05:50.275 --> 01:05:52.055]  And tribulus from India.

[01:06:19.191 --> 01:06:23.393]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[01:06:25.013 --> 01:06:27.794]  And I won't ever take you back.
[01:06:31.315 --> 01:06:35.857]  Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me.
[01:06:37.277 --> 01:06:42.099]  Cause I don't love you, now if you'll buy that.
[01:06:43.519 --> 01:06:47.881]  I got some portion front property and I
[01:06:53.253 --> 01:07:01.736]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:07:01.877 --> 01:07:02.557]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:02.677 --> 01:07:03.397]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:04.118]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.218 --> 01:07:07.239]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[01:07:07.259 --> 01:07:16.683]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:18.464]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:07:18.584 --> 01:07:25.148]  It took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the floor.
[01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:42.788]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:50.134]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:51.375]  UFOs.
[01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.517]  Is this global governance at last?
[01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:54.538]  Is it one world?
[01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:56.059]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:07:56.119 --> 01:08:01.543]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:08:01.603 --> 01:08:04.906]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:08:05.106 --> 01:08:10.627]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:08:10.727 --> 01:08:11.967]  Russian scum!
[01:08:12.247 --> 01:08:13.048]  Denied everything.
[01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.508]  He called it all fake news.
[01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:17.388]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:19.349]  This is a national emergency.
[01:08:19.469 --> 01:08:25.190]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:08:25.230 --> 01:08:27.750]  This is a female high-level election.
[01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:30.431]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:36.113]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[01:08:36.454 --> 01:08:39.255]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:41.316]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[01:08:42.356 --> 01:08:46.238]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:47.138 --> 01:08:48.739]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:09.121 --> 01:09:12.422]  You're watching this live Thursday, September 13th, Global Transmission.
[01:09:12.502 --> 01:09:20.604]  And if you're watching us on television, you can see thousands of illegal aliens in military uniforms carrying giant rucksacks on their backs.
[01:09:20.644 --> 01:09:24.965]  Many carrying fully automatic assault rifles on horseback.
[01:09:28.246 --> 01:09:31.507]  So, this is not your oceanfront property in Arizona.
[01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.627]  And from your front porch, you can see the sea.
[01:09:33.647 --> 01:09:37.288]  Let's hear a little bit from George Strait right now while we watch this video.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:45.003]  Now, if you'll buy that, I got some oceanfront property.
[01:09:48.606 --> 01:10:06.961]  You know, I got a signal from high-level folks in Army Special Operations that they know what's going on, and not from Steve Pchenik, it was from people at Fort Bragg, and they said, they said, Alex, we believe March is when they're going to try to kill the President.
[01:10:08.894 --> 01:10:12.575]  And they said, we're ready, and just, you need to be ready.
[01:10:12.856 --> 01:10:14.256]  And I said, should I relay that info?
[01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:21.979]  And they said, well, the enemy may change their operations, but it's definitely being directed from China, and they plan to kill Trump in March.
[01:10:22.039 --> 01:10:25.220]  I thought I would just let people know that Fort Bragg's preparing for that.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.141]  They think something's in March of next year.
[01:10:30.322 --> 01:10:31.684]  Who knows, the enemy could change their plan.
[01:10:32.224 --> 01:10:32.965]  Let me explain something.
[01:10:33.566 --> 01:10:38.591]  Thousands of armed men on horseback with giant drug packages coming across one ranch.
[01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:39.672]  All confirmed.
[01:10:39.692 --> 01:10:41.494]  Infowars.com, Daily Caller.
[01:10:43.276 --> 01:10:52.226]  And I was on Infowars last night, saw you go to that so-called church, which are really illegal alien invasion points, openly funded by the UN and George Soros.
[01:10:54.684 --> 01:11:05.456]  And then I went to sleep and forgot about it, and I got back up, and I saw comments on InfoWars going, Jones, why does this headline say you're covering the CBS head, you know, reportedly roping women?
[01:11:06.377 --> 01:11:07.939]  That isn't important, it's the invasion.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.101]  And I'm like, yeah, partner.
[01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:15.007]  I screenshotted that and sent it to all the producers, and I said, the listeners are right, we need to be on this.
[01:11:16.493 --> 01:11:22.335]  But this has already been going on, but then listeners think there's like some cultic control here, where I'm telling everyone what to cover.
[01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:29.677]  Believe me, we get so close to the problem, we need you to send us emails and call us and say, hey, why aren't you doing this?
[01:11:32.598 --> 01:11:40.160]  Because, you know, Owen got so upset by this last night, he went down to one of these churches, it's a staging ground, and they're down in Guatemala and Nicaragua and El Salvador.
[01:11:41.226 --> 01:11:42.086]  This is from the U.N.
[01:11:42.527 --> 01:11:43.047]  The U.N.
[01:11:43.147 --> 01:11:53.632]  aid agency, middle of last year, about 14 months ago, Trump killed the UNESCO treaty that George Herbert Walker Bush signed one month before he left office in 1992.
[01:11:53.692 --> 01:11:54.833]  Signed in December 1992.
[01:11:57.751 --> 01:12:01.314]  And if you read it, it says our education, our system, everything is UNESCO.
[01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:09.160]  And so what the UN Cultural, Economic, Environmental Organization says, you then adopt as the curriculum, as the border.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.941]  They would decide who could come in.
[01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:18.527]  They would certify the Afghans and the Somalis and then say they're allowed to come in and our State Department would then certify it.
[01:12:19.147 --> 01:12:20.569]  Now that's the UN running our borders.
[01:12:21.369 --> 01:12:22.110]  That's world government.
[01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.591]  Trump pulled it out, so what do they do?
[01:12:25.814 --> 01:12:37.826]  They went and they got involved and Soros and the UN set up refugee centers in Nicaragua, El Salvador.
[01:12:39.451 --> 01:12:46.236]  San Salvador and Guatemala, and then they're publicly funding with billions of dollars, much of it U.S.
[01:12:46.256 --> 01:12:48.557]  taxpayers through the U.N., to flood us.
[01:12:48.577 --> 01:12:49.858]  This is a weapon system.
[01:12:50.078 --> 01:12:51.960]  They don't care about poor third-world people.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:13:03.528]  They want to bring them in desperate, make sure they never get jobs, just like in Europe, keep them under their control, and then have a kept group that'll burn down cities if they're not given what they need.
[01:13:04.701 --> 01:13:16.650]  And that's it, that's why 80 plus percent of the Islamic, Middle Eastern, North African invaders who were brought in the last five years to Europe, now it's 12 million of them, 80 plus percent never get a job.
[01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:17.550]  And you know who they deport?
[01:13:18.911 --> 01:13:20.432]  Anyone that converts to Christianity.
[01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:21.413]  This is in the news.
[01:13:22.334 --> 01:13:23.534]  Anyone that gets a job.
[01:13:24.615 --> 01:13:28.958]  So you're out of North Africa or the Middle East, you go, I want to be a Christian and I want a job and I like this.
[01:13:30.299 --> 01:13:31.440]  Your ass is shipped out.
[01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:32.461]  But you're...
[01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:42.070]  You're like, you, you want to walk around in your nightgown all day and wipe your ass with your hand and do all the rest of it?
[01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:45.992]  You are staying, you are golden, baby.
[01:13:46.612 --> 01:14:00.418]  So, Owen, I try to come up with words to describe them banning the term InfoWars, which is happening on YouTube and Facebook, and they're banning people saying you can't use a word, you can't even, now if it's negative and you say, see this is the counterfeit currency.
[01:14:01.718 --> 01:14:06.621]  They tell people, the New York Times and the Daily Mail, we won't just pay you $20,000 to $50,000 to lie about Alex Jones.
[01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:10.744]  And to most people's credit, hardly anybody is taking the money.
[01:14:12.685 --> 01:14:19.330]  We will put articles about you and talk about your business and put your picture up.
[01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.811]  And it's a form of payment.
[01:14:22.552 --> 01:14:27.575]  So the media uses clicks and hits, which is literal money if you're advertising,
[01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:32.611]  But for many, it's just the glory, to then, if you lie, they give you promotions.
[01:14:32.631 --> 01:14:36.672]  So if you lie about Infowars, we're gonna come back to Owen in the next segment, just sitting there very stoically.
[01:14:37.533 --> 01:14:40.974]  If you lie about Infowars, or Trump or anybody else, they push your video.
[01:14:41.594 --> 01:14:44.696]  The big thing about QAnon to know is, they never get demonetized.
[01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:46.076]  Nothing pro-Q.
[01:14:46.156 --> 01:14:50.298]  Oh, it gets instantly pushed to the front, because it's literal delusional garbage.
[01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.959]  I mean, I've talked to folks,
[01:14:52.939 --> 01:14:54.240]  Trump hates Sessions.
[01:14:54.921 --> 01:14:55.722]  He hates Mueller.
[01:14:55.942 --> 01:14:57.223]  You know, it's a real death battle.
[01:14:57.263 --> 01:15:00.326]  It's not, oh, Mueller's good and Alex is bad, he'll sue me again.
[01:15:00.346 --> 01:15:02.267]  But Alex is, Alex was actually the bad guy.
[01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:05.530]  Q said, we all go down the rabbit hole, we all go together.
[01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:13.277]  This cult talk, I'll get to that later, but this whole situation with the open border and the invasion, this is so stark, it made you mad, didn't it?
[01:15:13.777 --> 01:15:17.698]  Well, and here's what I'm doing now, Alex, because they're trying to censor us online.
[01:15:18.318 --> 01:15:25.640]  They want to come and disrupt any time that we want to have an event, or a march, or Trump wants to have an event, so why can't we go to their events and try to have a conversation?
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:32.362]  Now, obviously, you saw what happened, but I confronted, I believe I'm the first one to confront a congressman over that video.
[01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:33.482]  I don't think anyone else has done it.
[01:15:33.522 --> 01:15:34.863]  Silvio Garcia was in attendance.
[01:15:34.883 --> 01:15:35.543]  Tell folks what happened.
[01:15:35.563 --> 01:15:36.983]  We're going to come back and give you the floor.
[01:15:37.003 --> 01:15:40.044]  I mean, you're now going to confront these people that are saying, have an open border.
[01:15:41.013 --> 01:15:46.279]  And the main sentence, the main thing is here, Trump is separating children at the border.
[01:15:46.319 --> 01:15:59.152]  This is, we're in Texas, we have to do something about immigration policy, and it's all Trump's fault this, and separating the children, and the families, and I'm just like, hey, by the way, a bunch of men just came across the border with guns, you care about that?
[01:15:59.672 --> 01:16:01.014]  Oh, InfoWars is getting...
[01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:19.538]  This is part of a larger push for conservatives, where they allege that these social media companies have bias against conservatives, and it's very similar, I think, what you see them doing with the media, where they say that these powerful entities are pushing a supposed liberal bias on consumers.
[01:16:20.279 --> 01:16:31.945]  There isn't really anything there in most of the instances that they point to, but it's part of a larger agenda, and it's really a political issue that they're using to whip up the conservative base, excite the conservative base for the midterms.
[01:16:32.345 --> 01:16:33.566]  Look at this right here.
[01:16:33.606 --> 01:16:38.650]  The guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong.
[01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:40.411]  There's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[01:16:40.892 --> 01:16:42.833]  You are incredibly shameful.
[01:16:42.933 --> 01:16:43.714]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:16:43.754 --> 01:16:44.935]  You're just a... Look at you.
[01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:45.435]  Look, look, look.
[01:16:45.595 --> 01:16:49.438]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:52.881]  You're gonna go down to History Books at the Criminal News Network.
[01:16:53.161 --> 01:16:58.085]  This is one of the main people right here who thinks you have no memory.
[01:16:58.385 --> 01:16:59.526]  I mean, look at those eyes, folks.
[01:16:59.606 --> 01:17:01.588]  If you wanna see the eyes
[01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:12.575]  Look at those eyes, look at that slobbering to the system, and the criminals of CNN, all their warmongering and death, all their fake news.
[01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:17.839]  And then running around trying to police the Internet, to try to shut people down.
[01:17:17.859 --> 01:17:19.660]  And then you think people are so stupid.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.643]  On CNN a week later, you say no one's censoring anybody, no one's pushing for censoring.
[01:17:23.703 --> 01:17:28.046]  And then you say that Trump is the one attacking the press, but only does it stand up to your lies.
[01:17:28.826 --> 01:17:30.007]  Look at this guy's eyes, man.
[01:17:30.047 --> 01:17:31.948]  He's even more evil looking in person.
[01:17:32.108 --> 01:17:35.849]  You don't even respond because we're just scum.
[01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:39.731]  You sit up there at CNN with no viewers, no followers, everyone can't stand you.
[01:17:39.771 --> 01:17:42.293]  And no matter, you can shut everyone down on Earth, no one will like you.
[01:17:42.673 --> 01:17:43.653]  You understand that?
[01:17:44.033 --> 01:17:45.894]  You'll never have billions and billions of fans and followers.
[01:17:45.914 --> 01:17:47.115]  You'll never have people that love you.
[01:17:48.049 --> 01:17:50.050]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say, Alex?
[01:18:05.134 --> 01:18:06.695]  The hunger to extinguish the First Amendment.
[01:18:07.055 --> 01:18:08.256]  The hunger to deceive.
[01:18:08.556 --> 01:18:12.058]  But he can't do it because the fire of liberty is not going to be knocked out.
[01:18:12.178 --> 01:18:13.659]  You're the definition of a fraud.
[01:18:13.699 --> 01:18:17.501]  You are a charlatan that goes around lying about people to destroy the First Amendment.
[01:18:17.521 --> 01:18:18.662]  I haven't lied about anyone, Alex.
[01:18:18.682 --> 01:18:20.303]  Yes, you are a congenital liar.
[01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:24.765]  CNN is a giant fraud that hated the world over.
[01:18:24.926 --> 01:18:26.006]  None of what you're saying is true?
[01:18:26.066 --> 01:18:26.827]  No, yes it is.
[01:18:26.867 --> 01:18:28.067]  You are a liar.
[01:18:28.388 --> 01:18:32.150]  You think you can gaslight people and call for censorship and then a day later say you aren't?
[01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:34.091]  We've got all your statements.
[01:18:34.111 --> 01:18:34.671]  We've got everything.
[01:18:35.072 --> 01:18:36.413]  We've got you all over the place.
[01:18:36.453 --> 01:18:37.814]  Lobbying to have media taken down.
[01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:38.214]  That's not true.
[01:18:38.254 --> 01:18:39.435]  Lobbying to shut people down.
[01:18:39.455 --> 01:18:40.035]  That's not true.
[01:18:40.055 --> 01:18:41.416]  Asking people why they're not shut down.
[01:18:41.436 --> 01:18:42.057]  That's not true.
[01:18:42.077 --> 01:18:42.958]  Yes, engaging in all that.
[01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:43.678]  It's all true.
[01:18:44.038 --> 01:18:45.539]  We have all the clips of you saying it.
[01:18:45.599 --> 01:18:45.940]  Okay.
[01:18:47.401 --> 01:18:48.782]  Listen, everybody knows who you are.
[01:18:49.783 --> 01:18:55.307]  Look, you and Skelter get force-fed by Twitter, you get like a hundred retweets, because CNN's a joke.
[01:18:55.347 --> 01:18:56.588]  CNN's like government cheese.
[01:18:57.509 --> 01:18:59.390]  It literally is just force-fed to everyone everywhere.
[01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:00.191]  Everyone's sick of it.
[01:19:00.211 --> 01:19:02.933]  It's one of the main pretenders in this whole operation.
[01:19:02.953 --> 01:19:06.335]  You don't think we don't know about Obama's countering disinformation and propaganda?
[01:19:07.716 --> 01:19:09.698]  You don't think all that's going to come out who's funding this?
[01:19:11.239 --> 01:19:12.920]  And your little ID card and all the rest of it?
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.661]  You think we're stupid?
[01:19:16.136 --> 01:19:16.956]  We're playing games, huh?
[01:19:17.476 --> 01:19:18.857]  Think we don't know a thing or two, son?
[01:19:20.697 --> 01:19:22.117]  Yeah.
[01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:22.717]  That's illegal.
[01:19:23.077 --> 01:19:24.018]  That's what Obama set up.
[01:19:24.038 --> 01:19:25.898]  It's all going to come down.
[01:19:26.518 --> 01:19:38.140]  You think because you've got some Democrats and some committees and some stay-behind networks, like the 37 angry Democrats in the Justice Department trying to shut down Trump, you think because you've got a rogue group operating inside those agencies that you're going to be able to shut down the free press in America?
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:38.740]  We are here.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.660]  All the beer is here.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.221]  The American people are watching, and they're not going to let you win.
[01:19:43.181 --> 01:19:44.782]  You called for us to be the platform.
[01:19:44.802 --> 01:19:45.582]  You pushed it.
[01:19:45.622 --> 01:19:46.723]  Now you say it's not even happening.
[01:19:46.763 --> 01:19:47.603]  It is true.
[01:19:47.623 --> 01:19:49.084]  CNN lobbied for it.
[01:19:49.104 --> 01:19:51.365]  That's all CNN did was to call for me to be taken off here.
[01:19:51.706 --> 01:19:52.706]  That's all you've done.
[01:19:52.726 --> 01:19:54.127]  That's what you said needs to be taken down.
[01:19:54.387 --> 01:19:55.247]  Why aren't you taking it down?
[01:19:55.608 --> 01:19:59.530]  If I could rig the playing field and shut everybody else down, I might be a real voice again.
[01:20:05.212 --> 01:20:07.854]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.251 --> 01:20:26.762]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:20:28.404 --> 01:20:33.511]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:38.732 --> 01:20:40.273]  This is not a drill.
[01:20:40.293 --> 01:20:42.014]  This is not a movie.
[01:20:42.114 --> 01:20:44.795]  This is not Road Warrior.
[01:20:44.835 --> 01:20:46.436]  This is 2018, North America.
[01:21:04.795 --> 01:21:11.741]  Heavily armed individuals, over a thousand of them, caught on camera in camouflage, entering country illegally through Arizona Ranch.
[01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:13.983]  From Mexico.
[01:21:14.404 --> 01:21:17.827]  We've been playing the bombshell video, we'll roll some of it right now.
[01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:19.869]  This is incredible.
[01:21:19.889 --> 01:21:21.670]  And this is just one ranch.
[01:21:22.731 --> 01:21:26.335]  It's released dozens of hours, over a thousand people, clearly drug mule-ing in.
[01:21:27.694 --> 01:21:32.863]  Big packages on their back, semi-automatic weapons, horseback as well.
[01:21:33.544 --> 01:21:39.334]  And Owen sees this so he goes down to one of these quote liberal churches that really just means a UN command base.
[01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:40.776]  And again the UN from...
[01:21:42.321 --> 01:21:46.024]  Central America is running this whole Operation 3 UNESCO that Trump pulled us out of.
[01:21:46.544 --> 01:21:56.733]  Just like they're hammering Europe with open borders and the Zodiac boats are paid for and the EU army that they said didn't exist now is going to increase its troops sevenfold to quote keep countries from leaving.
[01:21:56.913 --> 01:21:57.313]  Wow!
[01:21:57.734 --> 01:22:00.116]  Unelected, won't let you leave, armed troops.
[01:22:00.176 --> 01:22:01.617]  Talk about Hitler invading Europe.
[01:22:03.634 --> 01:22:06.677]  The head of the Nazi operation, industrially, was the Junkers.
[01:22:07.077 --> 01:22:09.219]  Junker is the head of the unelected EU situation.
[01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:11.100]  So it's all repeating itself.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.482]  George Soros is at the heart of it.
[01:22:13.082 --> 01:22:19.587]  Owen, set this up, what's happened here, and then you go out to this church, where this congressman is, and you bring this up.
[01:22:20.548 --> 01:22:22.610]  I mean, recap what you said earlier, get into all of it.
[01:22:23.404 --> 01:22:29.867]  Well I saw this video and I was shocked, A, at the video, but then B, at the lack of media response.
[01:22:29.887 --> 01:22:34.349]  So as usual, InfoWars has to bring light to this stuff and force the mainstream media to cover it.
[01:22:35.009 --> 01:22:41.572]  And I'm also on a bunch of liberal or leftist email chains here in Austin, just so I can keep up with what they're doing.
[01:22:41.592 --> 01:22:44.474]  And every once in a while there's an event that I like to go to and talk to these people.
[01:22:45.334 --> 01:22:56.081]  Most of the time, I don't even bother Alex, because what I learned after going about five of these things, most of the time you're kind of just dealing with deranged individuals and cult leaders, and it's just kind of sick to even film it, I'll be honest.
[01:22:56.441 --> 01:23:11.691]  But I go to this event, and Sylvia Garcia is there, who is a congresswoman, and I'm just sitting there filming, and they open it up to questions, and of course they're bashing Trump the whole time, saying Trump is separating children from family, saying we need to do something about the children, we need to do something about this awful situation at the border, yadda yadda yadda.
[01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:12.392]  By the way,
[01:23:13.152 --> 01:23:19.837]  One of the women up there, Alex, you know, you say they use these churches as grounds to bring in illegal migrants.
[01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:21.117]  You know, he's not just saying that, folks.
[01:23:21.137 --> 01:23:28.182]  There was a woman on the panel, she was a panelist, who bragged about how she was an undocumented immigrant, how she was in the country illegally.
[01:23:28.623 --> 01:23:31.264]  Now, I didn't call ICE on her, I never, I didn't call police on her.
[01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.186]  Oh no, the UN, the UN coordinates.
[01:23:33.886 --> 01:23:41.311]  At the jumping off points in Tripoli, Libya, in the capital city of Guatemala, Guatemala City.
[01:23:42.132 --> 01:23:42.892]  It's on the news!
[01:23:42.952 --> 01:23:46.594]  The UN has these huge operations and they say, don't get off the train.
[01:23:46.935 --> 01:23:47.615]  Here's your money.
[01:23:47.975 --> 01:23:50.937]  The Mexican government will arrest you, but they're going to let you go El Norte.
[01:23:51.238 --> 01:23:53.379]  And then they get here and they're told where to go.
[01:23:53.419 --> 01:23:55.500]  The Democrats are waiting with buses.
[01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:59.263]  And then they load them on, they put them on welfare, they skim a bunch of the money.
[01:23:59.283 --> 01:24:00.924]  I mean, this is a criminal operation.
[01:24:01.044 --> 01:24:02.606]  So there's the event right there, guys.
[01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:03.527]  Pull that page back up.
[01:24:03.607 --> 01:24:04.789]  It was a panel last night.
[01:24:04.849 --> 01:24:07.031]  Texas is ground zero for immigration policy.
[01:24:07.071 --> 01:24:07.632]  Well, okay.
[01:24:07.832 --> 01:24:08.853]  What are they really talking about?
[01:24:08.913 --> 01:24:11.496]  We're ground zero for the UN destroying our borders.
[01:24:11.777 --> 01:24:17.604]  And it was really just an anti-Trump, anti-borders, you know, whatever, liberal talking point panel fest.
[01:24:18.164 --> 01:24:20.605]  Trump's being mean to children, even though he's not.
[01:24:20.766 --> 01:24:26.088]  It's a war zone, collapsed country, all these 100 people show up, you gotta check who they are, they process them.
[01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:33.012]  They say, don't process them like Obama did, load them directly on buses so they can be sex trafficked, even as the Washington Post admitted.
[01:24:33.412 --> 01:24:34.713]  Sex trafficking children.
[01:24:34.933 --> 01:24:39.696]  They want children alone, 7, 8 years old, to be given to Democrats.
[01:24:40.889 --> 01:24:41.470]  On buses.
[01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:42.530]  And it was the ACLU.
[01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:43.291]  Look, I've seen the video.
[01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:47.194]  It's like little Potbelly guys come out and go, children come to me and the children are gone.
[01:24:47.634 --> 01:24:51.397]  And as you pointed out, it was the ACLU that started this actually decades ago.
[01:24:51.677 --> 01:24:55.420]  But they don't care about... The ACLU was the one saying, you can't just put kids in general population.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.782]  So we'll play the clip in the next segment, Alex, so that people can hear.
[01:24:58.802 --> 01:24:59.703]  And then they brag.
[01:24:59.723 --> 01:25:01.184]  They're happy that free speech is dead.
[01:25:01.224 --> 01:25:02.805]  They brag about you being deplatformed.
[01:25:02.825 --> 01:25:03.446]  You're going to love that.
[01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:06.208]  They're like, oh, you're not on the air anymore, which isn't even true.
[01:25:06.948 --> 01:25:14.210]  Yeah, so it's just it's all crazy, but I point out, Alex, I'm like, well, OK, if you want to do something about because what is their complaint?
[01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:18.931]  Oh, the children are being mistreated and they're coming here and they're being separated in the families and it's all bad.
[01:25:18.951 --> 01:25:21.032]  And I said, well, look, why don't we have a border?
[01:25:21.092 --> 01:25:22.312]  Why don't we control the border?
[01:25:22.812 --> 01:25:24.852]  And part of the problem is, look at this.
[01:25:24.932 --> 01:25:27.813]  And I and I brought a stack of news so I could give one to everyone there.
[01:25:27.833 --> 01:25:29.214]  And I said, I have a stack of news.
[01:25:29.474 --> 01:25:30.694]  I'll give one to everyone here.
[01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:36.357]  Raw video, armed men in military uniforms coming across the border illegally.
[01:25:36.657 --> 01:25:37.978]  This is not good for anyone.
[01:25:38.718 --> 01:25:41.159]  And of course then they, oh, we got InfoWars in the house.
[01:25:41.279 --> 01:25:41.920]  Oh, get out!
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:42.340]  Bye!
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.380]  You know, they try to kick me out.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.421]  They don't want to answer my question.
[01:25:44.441 --> 01:25:45.962]  And I say, well now hold on a second.
[01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:55.035]  This is a congresswoman, I have a serious concern, this is a public event, and you live here, you pay taxes, I came, I'm talking!
[01:25:55.516 --> 01:26:06.363]  And so they try to shut me off, and the congresswoman, before she makes a drastic mistake, realizes, uh-oh, I better at least hear this gentleman out and says, okay, well let me see the news.
[01:26:06.423 --> 01:26:07.944]  Yeah, yeah, well I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:09.244]  You don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:10.965]  You don't know about the wide open border.
[01:26:10.986 --> 01:26:11.506]  Give me a break.
[01:26:11.826 --> 01:26:24.626]  Or 200,000 dead in the last few years, dead bodies everywhere, literal road warrior 18 wheelers with giant scoops, burning buildings, I mean it is beyond any science fiction movie.
[01:26:24.806 --> 01:26:26.228]  Where's the movie about Mexico?
[01:26:27.333 --> 01:26:33.695]  Devil cults that worship Satan, MS-13, you name it, torturing families to death to get vampiric power.
[01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:35.075]  That's mainstream news.
[01:26:35.535 --> 01:26:36.775]  Where's the movies about that?
[01:26:37.115 --> 01:26:44.057]  Well, how about all of these trucks and box trucks and semi-trucks that have been found in parking lots, Walmart parking lots?
[01:26:44.137 --> 01:26:44.977]  With hundreds of dead.
[01:26:45.257 --> 01:26:47.118]  Just people in the trucks.
[01:26:47.138 --> 01:26:55.540]  They were obviously coyote-ed across the border and then they just... Well, they tell the families, you haven't paid extra, so they lock the doors and kill them.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.120]  And that's the thing.
[01:26:59.141 --> 01:27:02.243]  It'll be like, oh, we found 27 dead people, or we found 100 dead people.
[01:27:02.343 --> 01:27:06.065]  And some children, imagine a mass shooting of five kids is all the news.
[01:27:06.325 --> 01:27:10.967]  But when they find thousands of total dead people, mainly in Texas, they don't even cover it.
[01:27:11.247 --> 01:27:13.588]  Because again, they don't want us to discuss it.
[01:27:13.768 --> 01:27:16.810]  Just like Facebook is banning the term, and so is Twitter, illegal alien.
[01:27:17.975 --> 01:27:23.382]  Here's the important thing, though, Alex, because this is just one man, and like you said, nobody gave me this directive.
[01:27:23.843 --> 01:27:24.844]  You didn't tell me to do this.
[01:27:24.944 --> 01:27:26.006]  Rob Du didn't tell me to do this.
[01:27:26.026 --> 01:27:27.047]  I just, I found this.
[01:27:27.087 --> 01:27:28.189]  That's why you're so good, Owen.
[01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:29.551]  You're just like a heat-seeking missile.
[01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:34.257]  And I'm not bragging, it's just, my point here is that, Alex, this is what we have to do to win.
[01:27:34.417 --> 01:27:38.360]  Yes, we have to go out where they're at and not yell and scream and call them nazis.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:53.990]  No, politely say, hey man, here's the video, a thousand plus men on horseback with machine guns, with giant bags on their back, could be weapons, who the hell knows, in camo, invading, and you're saying Trump's bad because they check who's who at the border?
[01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:56.672]  76% aren't even accompanied by adults?
[01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:58.613]  We want to throw them in general population?
[01:27:58.653 --> 01:28:00.154]  No, their answer is, let them go.
[01:28:00.354 --> 01:28:03.496]  They have to change the subject because what they're doing is indefensible.
[01:28:03.616 --> 01:28:04.337]  It is insane.
[01:28:05.117 --> 01:28:10.360]  And people just need to realize, if they want to sit there and they want to brag about Infowars being the platform, well that's fine.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.940]  I just dominated your event.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.601]  I just won their event.
[01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:15.762]  I just showed up and won their event.
[01:28:16.022 --> 01:28:18.663]  Because that's what one informed patriot can do.
[01:28:18.683 --> 01:28:21.124]  And then they'll say, oh we'll get rid of your sub-Facebook account.
[01:28:21.184 --> 01:28:23.305]  Good, we'll break up Facebook, we'll break up Twitter.
[01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:24.626]  And I can tell you, it's coming.
[01:28:25.146 --> 01:28:32.188]  So you guys are going to lose the election, the red wave's here, you committed criminal actions, you've tried to racketeer, you are screwed.
[01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:35.968]  Well this is what I want for the Infowars army Alex.
[01:28:36.088 --> 01:28:37.729]  There's leftist events, there's leftist media.
[01:28:37.749 --> 01:28:39.389]  Let's talk about it when we come back, but that's the thing.
[01:28:39.469 --> 01:28:40.069]  Leaked video.
[01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:47.131]  Google leadership dismayed reaction to election of Trump, pledged to defeat Trump in the future by controlling the public's minds.
[01:28:47.151 --> 01:28:47.991]  These are quotes.
[01:28:48.431 --> 01:28:51.332]  We have Jim Jordan saying that we're gonna... These are criminals!
[01:28:51.853 --> 01:28:55.794]  Google runs China's extermination operations and spying.
[01:28:56.155 --> 01:28:57.855]  These are murdering criminals!
[01:29:03.358 --> 01:29:05.019]  What are champions made of?
[01:29:06.759 --> 01:29:07.900]  Here's a man who can show you.

[01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:05.399]  Go ahead.
[01:32:05.659 --> 01:32:11.242]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:32:11.462 --> 01:32:12.543]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:32:12.863 --> 01:32:15.304]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:32:15.324 --> 01:32:16.885]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:32:16.925 --> 01:32:17.625]  I was exhausted.
[01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:21.147]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[01:32:21.487 --> 01:32:26.110]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[01:32:26.210 --> 01:32:28.231]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:32:28.291 --> 01:32:28.791]  Same thing.
[01:32:28.951 --> 01:32:31.032]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at Infowars.
[01:32:31.132 --> 01:32:32.373]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:34.635]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:32:34.655 --> 01:32:40.639]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:32:40.939 --> 01:32:41.720]  You can sleep with it.
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:46.403]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:32:46.463 --> 01:32:49.245]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:32:49.405 --> 01:32:51.126]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:32:51.226 --> 01:32:51.926]  It really works.
[01:32:52.146 --> 01:32:56.669]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:32:58.951 --> 01:32:59.251]  Believe me.
[01:33:05.175 --> 01:33:07.957]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:07.977 --> 01:33:20.926]  54 Days Out.
[01:33:23.058 --> 01:33:25.241]  You're listening to the most historic election in world history.
[01:33:26.082 --> 01:33:30.648]  You're listening to the most banned, demonized, lied-about transmission in the world.
[01:33:30.968 --> 01:33:38.699]  Because we're pro-human, we believe in you, we believe in Jesus Christ, and we believe in human future, human victory.
[01:33:40.879 --> 01:33:45.263]  People ask, why do we listen to Elon Musk and all these other big tech guys, and it's everything you said 20 years ago?
[01:33:45.824 --> 01:33:52.930]  Because I was reading white papers that the globalists put out about an anti-human, post-human future, and I'm like, wow, this really sucks.
[01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:53.831]  I believe in humanity.
[01:33:56.314 --> 01:33:59.977]  Owen Troyer's here, riding shotgun with me, and we're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:34:00.578 --> 01:34:02.639]  Owen, just recapping this.
[01:34:04.111 --> 01:34:06.273]  200,000 dead in Mexico the last few years.
[01:34:06.393 --> 01:34:07.294]  Total collapse.
[01:34:07.914 --> 01:34:11.297]  Road warrior armored vehicles and 18-wheelers ramming people.
[01:34:11.417 --> 01:34:12.858]  Machine gun death everywhere.
[01:34:13.558 --> 01:34:14.259]  Mass graves.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.722]  Like I said, thousands of illegals found dead in 18-wheelers.
[01:34:18.082 --> 01:34:19.403]  It gets like five seconds of news.
[01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:24.807]  Oh, we found 67 dead people, including 12 kids, in the back of an 18-wheeler in San Antonio.
[01:34:24.987 --> 01:34:25.648]  Big frickin' deal!
[01:34:26.028 --> 01:34:26.388]  Move on!
[01:34:26.788 --> 01:34:27.929]  That's the dehumanization.
[01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:32.353]  Oh, they love Hispanics so much all day, but when that's happening, it's not in the news.
[01:34:34.093 --> 01:34:35.858]  Because they're collapsing the country.
[01:34:35.898 --> 01:34:40.331]  It's the UN Global Sorrows plan to collapse nation states, just like they're doing with Europe.
[01:34:41.363 --> 01:34:42.964]  This is 21st century war.
[01:34:43.545 --> 01:34:45.926]  This is how the globalists target you.
[01:34:46.527 --> 01:34:47.988]  So, Owen, tell people about the church.
[01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:48.928]  We'll play the clip.
[01:34:48.948 --> 01:34:49.429]  We'll get into it.
[01:34:49.449 --> 01:34:53.231]  You decide, oh, they've got a congressperson, a democrat, who's pushing this.
[01:34:53.271 --> 01:34:54.832]  You saw him beat that little girl.
[01:34:55.092 --> 01:34:56.253]  You know, he raped her too.
[01:34:56.874 --> 01:34:57.654]  Might as well say that.
[01:34:57.694 --> 01:34:59.295]  No, she was never separated from her mother.
[01:35:00.096 --> 01:35:01.757]  She hadn't eaten in 12 hours.
[01:35:01.797 --> 01:35:02.698]  They were out of food and water.
[01:35:03.198 --> 01:35:05.680]  She's been in the desert for days.
[01:35:06.872 --> 01:35:12.093]  Mommy ran away from Daddy, and the word is, because Mommy makes some money coming up to the border.
[01:35:12.353 --> 01:35:14.794]  Oh, wonder what... Yeah, the Border Patrol's kind of nice now.
[01:35:14.814 --> 01:35:17.974]  They're like, let's take this satchel and say this wasn't here.
[01:35:18.915 --> 01:35:20.875]  Because it's just, it's totally lawless.
[01:35:21.475 --> 01:35:23.596]  And so, oh, he looms over her.
[01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:24.476]  What a meanie.
[01:35:24.816 --> 01:35:26.096]  Never taken from her family.
[01:35:27.196 --> 01:35:28.597]  System set up by ACLU 20 years ago.
[01:35:30.461 --> 01:35:36.924]  And so you go down there, and you're like, hey, we've got a thousand-plus armed men at one ranch with machine guns and camo.
[01:35:36.984 --> 01:35:37.665]  What the hell?
[01:35:39.045 --> 01:35:43.768]  And crime waves everywhere, and they're saying, oh, you don't even exist anymore.
[01:35:43.808 --> 01:35:44.929]  Kind of like Rubio said to me.
[01:35:44.949 --> 01:35:47.470]  It's this leftist, make-believe Aleister Crowley crap.
[01:35:48.769 --> 01:35:51.890]  Yeah, we'll hear that in a clip in just a second, but here's what bothered me, Alex.
[01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:52.690]  It's like what you're talking about.
[01:35:53.070 --> 01:36:01.312]  They're going to have this panel, and they're going to have, you know, emails nationwide, the ACLU, everything, all this crap over fake news.
[01:36:01.913 --> 01:36:08.995]  Fake news that Trump is putting kids in cages and that Trump is responsible for separating families at borders.
[01:36:09.015 --> 01:36:09.555]  100% fake news.
[01:36:09.815 --> 01:36:14.316]  They know it's fake news, but they have these panels and discussions and email changes.
[01:36:14.336 --> 01:36:17.417]  And it's photos from the Obama era because they hadn't beefed up the stuff yet.
[01:36:17.617 --> 01:36:18.957]  So I just... Now it's quite nice.
[01:36:19.037 --> 01:36:21.358]  So actually Candace Owens shot a great video.
[01:36:21.378 --> 01:36:26.719]  She went to one of the family detention centers in Florida, said it's nicer than any public school she's ever seen.
[01:36:26.999 --> 01:36:29.460]  So they actually... Believe me, I saw the food they're eating.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.240]  I guess they got the Border Patrol cooking.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.580]  That looks like some damn good migas.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.461]  No, they get yoga classes.
[01:36:34.501 --> 01:36:36.141]  They got, you know, all kinds of stuff.
[01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:37.681]  You know, recreation centers, everything.
[01:36:37.721 --> 01:36:38.321]  So that's great.
[01:36:38.341 --> 01:36:39.462]  You know, the average stay is 48 hours.
[01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:43.824]  And so they get a better treatment than the average public school student in America?
[01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:45.065]  You know, it's awful for them.
[01:36:45.085 --> 01:36:45.545]  Bad on us.
[01:36:46.266 --> 01:36:53.490]  So I'm sick of them dominating their little, you know, thought spectrums with fake news.
[01:36:53.711 --> 01:36:54.451]  So I say, OK, you know what?
[01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:58.494]  I'm going to go film this and we'll show the people what these people talk about behind the scenes.
[01:36:58.874 --> 01:37:02.877]  And I'm going to inject my point and I'm going to say, look, you guys just talked about fake news for an hour.
[01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:03.897]  Here's real news.
[01:37:04.097 --> 01:37:05.518]  I got a stack of stories here.
[01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:06.679]  I'm going to leave it for you.
[01:37:07.019 --> 01:37:08.821]  Can I please get an answer from my congresswoman?
[01:37:08.861 --> 01:37:10.642]  So the story is I see the video.
[01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:16.964]  Of the men coming across the border in fatigues and rucksacks and rifles and everything.
[01:37:17.384 --> 01:37:20.365]  And that's like, okay, okay, here's InfoWars, we have to blow this up.
[01:37:20.385 --> 01:37:22.626]  I thought I was looking at World War I footage.
[01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:25.527]  I mean, it's dudes on horseback with machine guns, a thousand.
[01:37:25.647 --> 01:37:27.768]  So if no one's going to cover it, then we have to cover it.
[01:37:27.868 --> 01:37:31.909]  And then as I want, I mean, I'm never going to ask the InfoWars Army to do anything I won't do.
[01:37:32.029 --> 01:37:33.309]  So I won't explain it to the Army.
[01:37:33.349 --> 01:37:37.771]  We want everybody to peacefully, lawfully, we've had folks threaten us and go, oh, there'll be a false flag if it was Army.
[01:37:38.351 --> 01:37:39.211]  That'll be an operative.
[01:37:39.252 --> 01:37:39.892]  We're peaceful.
[01:37:39.972 --> 01:37:40.832]  Our mission is clear.
[01:37:41.172 --> 01:37:43.254]  Go out, speak out, expose what's going on.
[01:37:43.614 --> 01:37:45.375]  Go to these congresspeople's meetings.
[01:37:45.895 --> 01:37:53.279]  Go in, videotape it, live stream it, send it to us, upload it, whatever, and bring this up to them that, hey, that little girl wasn't separated from her parents.
[01:37:53.579 --> 01:37:56.140]  This is an ACLU-era deal from 25 years ago.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.321]  How dare you lie?
[01:37:58.181 --> 01:38:00.123]  So again, describe who the congressperson was.
[01:38:00.283 --> 01:38:03.685]  And if you change one person's mind at one of these meetings, it's worth it.
[01:38:03.785 --> 01:38:08.488]  It was Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, and I asked her about this.
[01:38:08.568 --> 01:38:09.669]  Nobody wanted to answer my question.
[01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:10.250]  They kicked me out.
[01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:11.991]  They bragged about Alex Jones being deplatformed.
[01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:12.971]  Guys, do we have the video ready?
[01:38:13.011 --> 01:38:13.812]  Let's just go.
[01:38:14.513 --> 01:38:20.357]  This is me last night at a liberal event at Central Presbyterian Church where they're blaming Trump for the separation.
[01:38:20.377 --> 01:38:21.397]  Again, I can't tweet this.
[01:38:21.517 --> 01:38:23.539]  Everybody else, you have to tweet it.
[01:38:23.979 --> 01:38:25.587]  You have to re-upload it.
[01:38:25.607 --> 01:38:26.994]  There's no copyright on anything we do.
[01:38:27.295 --> 01:38:27.878]  Get it out there.
[01:38:27.898 --> 01:38:28.199]  Here it is.
[01:38:30.558 --> 01:38:32.980]  Yeah, is it Ms.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:33.480]  Garcia?
[01:38:33.901 --> 01:38:34.521]  Right?
[01:38:34.901 --> 01:38:36.482]  Just spoke, Senator Garcia?
[01:38:36.903 --> 01:38:47.251]  Yeah, you just said that we should stop, you know, the family detention and all the harm that's being done to these families, but don't you think actually doing something about the border would be the best option?
[01:38:47.291 --> 01:38:48.592]  You say you want to keep terrorists out.
[01:38:48.612 --> 01:38:49.632]  I have a stack of news.
[01:38:50.093 --> 01:38:51.734]  I brought a copy for everyone here today.
[01:38:52.294 --> 01:38:59.460]  There was video of armed men walking right across the border, dozens of them in military uniforms.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.261]  So that doesn't help anyone.
[01:39:01.281 --> 01:39:03.303]  That doesn't help immigrants that want to come here legally.
[01:39:03.323 --> 01:39:10.228]  And I'm just curious, you know, if we want to stop family detention and all this horror that you're talking about, why don't we actually secure the border?
[01:39:10.268 --> 01:39:11.689]  I think that that would be the best option.
[01:39:12.009 --> 01:39:14.311]  And if you want to also stop... Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:39:14.771 --> 01:39:19.435]  It's the lawlessness of the border that allows the lawlessness in Mexico.
[01:39:19.895 --> 01:39:25.720]  Our not letting the border be controlled and letting the drugs and crime and people come across is what created the criminal
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.461]  Wild West situation.
[01:39:30.802 --> 01:39:32.002]  Major studies admit this.
[01:39:32.042 --> 01:39:34.703]  So again, of course you need to shut that down.
[01:39:34.783 --> 01:39:35.823]  That's what will clean that up.
[01:39:36.504 --> 01:39:41.205]  And isn't it more obvious than ever when you have a video like this with just thousands of armed men?
[01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:44.727]  I mean, how can you get away with that unless there is no border, total lawlessness?
[01:39:45.607 --> 01:39:57.670]  And again, they have an Amnesty International study, 80%, I think it's 87, look it up, 80 plus percent of women and little girls as young as 5 are raped.
[01:39:58.689 --> 01:40:00.570]  When they cross by the coyotes.
[01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:05.071]  And again, it's not Don Johnson in machete shooting the pregnant Mexican.
[01:40:05.511 --> 01:40:07.452]  It's the cartels doing it.
[01:40:07.552 --> 01:40:08.652]  And so again, that's Hollywood.
[01:40:09.273 --> 01:40:10.793]  And it's their family that sends them.
[01:40:10.953 --> 01:40:12.534]  They say separation of family happens at the border.
[01:40:12.554 --> 01:40:18.176]  No, their family sends their daughters with emergency contraceptives because they know they're going to get raped.
[01:40:19.216 --> 01:40:20.556]  So, so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:20.576 --> 01:40:21.137]  Type that in.
[01:40:21.657 --> 01:40:21.977]  There it is.
[01:40:22.057 --> 01:40:25.778]  Eighty percent of official American women, girls are rape crossing the U.S.
[01:40:26.438 --> 01:40:26.979]  from Mexico.
[01:40:27.059 --> 01:40:28.059]  Huffington Post.
[01:40:29.517 --> 01:40:30.338]  But they ignore that.
[01:40:30.398 --> 01:40:31.739]  So let's go back to the video.
[01:40:31.839 --> 01:40:32.539]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.440]  It's total truth.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.821]  Go back.
[01:40:35.782 --> 01:40:41.166]  Men walking right across the border, dozens of them in military uniforms.
[01:40:41.847 --> 01:40:42.947]  So that doesn't help anyone.
[01:40:42.987 --> 01:40:45.029]  That doesn't help immigrants that want to come here legally.
[01:40:45.429 --> 01:40:51.914]  And I'm just curious, you know, if we want to stop family detention and all this horror that you're talking about, why don't we actually secure the border?
[01:40:51.974 --> 01:40:53.375]  I think that that would be the best option.
[01:40:53.696 --> 01:40:58.659]  And if you want to also stop baby prisons, maybe we should stop abortion centers, too, from killing them.
[01:40:59.541 --> 01:41:00.808]  Well, I think info is easier.
[01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:03.041]  So, next question?
[01:41:04.662 --> 01:41:05.202]  Well, that's fine.
[01:41:05.242 --> 01:41:06.302]  You guys can discount me.
[01:41:06.322 --> 01:41:08.323]  I will leave this stack of news for you.
[01:41:08.963 --> 01:41:09.503]  Video!
[01:41:09.803 --> 01:41:10.203]  Video!
[01:41:10.263 --> 01:41:13.704]  Senator, are you going to do anything about a video of armed men?
[01:41:13.764 --> 01:41:14.325]  Excuse me, sir.
[01:41:14.365 --> 01:41:15.365]  I have a right to free speech.
[01:41:15.645 --> 01:41:16.405]  This is a senator.
[01:41:16.805 --> 01:41:18.085]  I'll leave this stack of news.
[01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:19.326]  You guys can look at the videos.
[01:41:19.346 --> 01:41:20.286]  I'm going to put it right here.
[01:41:21.006 --> 01:41:21.646]  Armed men!
[01:41:21.966 --> 01:41:24.227]  Armed men in military uniforms!
[01:41:24.747 --> 01:41:26.708]  Armed men in military uniforms!
[01:41:27.328 --> 01:41:29.909]  I'd like you to comment for my senator, and you guys want me to go.
[01:41:30.049 --> 01:41:31.529]  Senator, will you please give me a comment?
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:42.105]  I mean, she knows Mexico is a failed state war zone.
[01:41:42.125 --> 01:41:43.486]  And they always play dumb.
[01:41:44.326 --> 01:41:44.727]  There you go.
[01:41:44.787 --> 01:41:45.187]  Thank you.
[01:41:45.247 --> 01:41:45.627]  Thank you.
[01:41:45.647 --> 01:41:47.208]  Appreciate it.
[01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:47.868]  Okay, thank you.
[01:41:47.908 --> 01:41:51.250]  These are armed men, ladies and gentlemen, in military uniform.
[01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:52.431]  Dozens of them.
[01:41:55.139 --> 01:41:57.420]  Well, I just think it's ridiculous that you blame the Trump administration.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.481]  That's thousands in each clip of the video.
[01:41:58.501 --> 01:41:59.402]  That's a year of it.
[01:41:59.422 --> 01:42:00.503]  It's thousands.
[01:42:00.763 --> 01:42:03.064]  Family separation starting long before Trump.
[01:42:03.305 --> 01:42:05.987]  In fact, Trump is the only president to do anything about it.
[01:42:06.307 --> 01:42:08.228]  He signed an executive order to stop it.
[01:42:08.308 --> 01:42:09.529]  No other presidents do that.
[01:42:09.869 --> 01:42:12.151]  This is sad that you guys fall for this brainwashing.
[01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:13.152]  You should check up on it.
[01:42:14.093 --> 01:42:18.016]  We should do something about the border, not President Trump trying to save this country.
[01:42:18.056 --> 01:42:18.677]  Yeah, bye.
[01:42:18.717 --> 01:42:19.317]  You're welcome.
[01:42:19.558 --> 01:42:22.480]  You're welcome for informing you all.
[01:42:23.081 --> 01:42:23.481]  Oh, really?
[01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:25.082]  We lost our platform, sir.
[01:42:25.302 --> 01:42:29.126]  So this man is now celebrating free speech dead in America, and I got news.
[01:42:29.206 --> 01:42:31.608]  Our web traffic is up tenfold.
[01:42:32.088 --> 01:42:32.709]  Tenfold.
[01:42:32.969 --> 01:42:33.729]  You guys are losing.
[01:42:33.749 --> 01:42:34.590]  That's why your room is empty.
[01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:35.391]  It's only up threefold.
[01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:36.191]  Don't exaggerate.
[01:42:36.211 --> 01:42:37.973]  I have more audience on my stream right now.
[01:42:38.313 --> 01:42:39.554]  You guys have a wonderful night.
[01:42:39.594 --> 01:42:40.215]  God bless you.
[01:42:42.287 --> 01:42:44.028]  But again, oh, you're the platform.
[01:42:44.048 --> 01:42:46.690]  We put you into outer space.
[01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:50.872]  You notice how when I brought up stopping abortion, how that's when they all first shrieked?
[01:42:51.213 --> 01:42:52.473]  Doesn't that tell you everything?
[01:42:52.834 --> 01:42:54.475]  Why don't you guys stop abortion if you care about kids?
[01:42:56.056 --> 01:42:58.317]  I mean, that tells you everything, Alex, right there.
[01:42:58.757 --> 01:42:59.118]  Amazing.
[01:42:59.138 --> 01:42:59.758]  Good job, Owen.
[01:42:59.778 --> 01:43:03.681]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:43:03.701 --> 01:43:05.442]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:43:05.862 --> 01:43:08.684]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[01:43:09.773 --> 01:43:20.816]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[01:43:21.276 --> 01:43:30.339]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[01:43:30.859 --> 01:43:36.445]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.

[01:43:44.354 --> 01:43:46.376]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[01:43:47.636 --> 01:43:50.457]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:52.038]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:43:52.678 --> 01:43:55.239]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:43:55.999 --> 01:43:57.960]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.761]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[01:44:02.625 --> 01:44:07.286]  SurvivalSylladex2, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:07.706 --> 01:44:15.768]  But this is the pure 999999999 stuff, 4.9 stars on Power Reviews, 6,000 plus reviews, 98% reviews.
[01:44:15.808 --> 01:44:16.848]  It's an amazing product.
[01:44:17.048 --> 01:44:18.669]  We had a really good seaweed source.
[01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:23.250]  It was one of the top rated in the world five years ago, and the globalists doing economic sabotage.
[01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:25.871]  Reached out, found out where we're getting it, and blocked it.
[01:44:25.951 --> 01:44:28.353]  So then we found a source, working with a big top U.S.
[01:44:28.413 --> 01:44:32.616]  lab that doesn't want to be named because they get harassed, to get it from oil companies where it's 9999999 pure.
[01:44:32.836 --> 01:44:35.597]  You gotta have a DEA license to get it.
[01:44:35.737 --> 01:44:37.118]  You know, once it's put in the palm oil, it isn't.
[01:44:37.138 --> 01:44:37.999]  It's all patented.
[01:44:38.079 --> 01:44:42.842]  This has been our best seller, but the oil companies then figured out what was going on, so they doubled, they tripled prices.
[01:44:42.962 --> 01:44:43.842]  I'm not gonna sell this for $50.
[01:44:45.063 --> 01:44:46.884]  I'm not gonna pay twenty-something dollars for it.
[01:44:47.424 --> 01:44:49.105]  You know, I'm not gonna sit there and do that.
[01:44:49.225 --> 01:44:54.306]  So, I did a huge order at the old price, and then they still raised it, so I broke my contract.
[01:44:54.386 --> 01:44:54.987]  I said, that's it.
[01:44:55.107 --> 01:44:55.547]  No more extra.
[01:44:55.627 --> 01:44:57.668]  And this is the best, purest iodine out there.
[01:44:57.768 --> 01:44:59.028]  Everybody sees the difference.
[01:44:59.048 --> 01:45:00.249]  The others are bound to stuff.
[01:45:00.409 --> 01:45:01.149]  I wish there was other ones.
[01:45:01.269 --> 01:45:05.171]  We're working right now with some other petroleum exploring companies to try to have a new X2.
[01:45:05.231 --> 01:45:06.432]  This we'll call it X3.
[01:45:07.012 --> 01:45:09.854]  And we may be close, but this is the last run of X2.
[01:45:09.894 --> 01:45:11.454]  So I've broken the contract.
[01:45:11.615 --> 01:45:12.135]  This is it.
[01:45:12.615 --> 01:45:13.956]  X2, it's amazing.
[01:45:14.036 --> 01:45:15.437]  This stuff changed my life.
[01:45:15.497 --> 01:45:18.638]  Now talk to your physician, because if you've already got pre-existing issues, who knows?
[01:45:18.738 --> 01:45:20.659]  But iodine is life-giving.
[01:45:20.699 --> 01:45:21.860]  This is the end of X2.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.761]  And I hope and pray to God we get something better.
[01:45:23.801 --> 01:45:25.342]  People say, well, why are you 25% off?
[01:45:25.442 --> 01:45:27.143]  I always discount products.
[01:45:27.303 --> 01:45:28.464]  We normally discount at 25%, okay?
[01:45:29.224 --> 01:45:29.344]  Okay.
[01:45:29.504 --> 01:45:33.028]  And so until we get down to a few thousand bottles, it's going to be there.
[01:45:33.068 --> 01:45:35.590]  And then it's going to go to the full price in the last few thousand bottles.
[01:45:35.650 --> 01:45:37.552]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[01:45:37.853 --> 01:45:39.214]  And then you know you're getting a great product.
[01:45:39.294 --> 01:45:39.835]  Just experience.
[01:45:39.855 --> 01:45:40.475]  It takes a few weeks.
[01:45:40.535 --> 01:45:45.701]  Now, when I first started taking it five years ago, before I even sold it, when they had patents, it was the newest thing.
[01:45:46.121 --> 01:45:47.022]  Folks said, I don't know, about two
[01:45:47.022 --> 01:45:49.805]  Two, three weeks in, you're gonna feel really toxic and bad.
[01:45:49.945 --> 01:45:51.447]  And stuff's gonna come out of your skin.
[01:45:51.467 --> 01:45:52.167]  It all happened.
[01:45:52.267 --> 01:45:53.809]  But it was disgusting.
[01:45:53.929 --> 01:45:55.631]  I mean, all this stuff came out of my skin.
[01:45:55.791 --> 01:45:58.474]  All these things happened because this is what powers the whole body.
[01:45:58.554 --> 01:46:00.456]  And this is pure, so it goes right into your blood.
[01:46:00.536 --> 01:46:03.339]  I mean, the stuff we have so pure, it turns into gas above 90 degrees.
[01:46:03.519 --> 01:46:05.161]  Right there, like, I Dream of Jeannie if you're watching.
[01:46:05.221 --> 01:46:05.801]  Purple gas.
[01:46:06.682 --> 01:46:07.363]  And that's not, again, a...
[01:46:07.543 --> 01:46:08.084]  Fiction movie.
[01:46:08.124 --> 01:46:08.864]  That's happening.
[01:46:08.904 --> 01:46:09.625]  That's how pure it is.
[01:46:09.665 --> 01:46:10.446]  Nobody else has got this.
[01:46:10.506 --> 01:46:11.727]  And this is the last.
[01:46:12.107 --> 01:46:13.268]  We may be able to get another source.
[01:46:13.288 --> 01:46:14.209]  We're working on it right now.
[01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:22.117]  But if you want X2, our best-selling amazing product that blows every other so-called iodine away, it's available 25% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:22.297 --> 01:46:24.619]  But this is the final run of X2.
[01:46:24.639 --> 01:46:25.340]  If you want it, get it.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.701]  And it supports the broadcast.
[01:46:26.901 --> 01:46:27.942]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:28.062 --> 01:46:28.823]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:28.843 --> 01:46:29.364]  Stay with us.
[01:46:34.758 --> 01:46:35.219]  Have you heard?
[01:46:35.699 --> 01:46:37.782]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:46:37.842 --> 01:46:39.144]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:46:39.324 --> 01:46:40.366]  They're all censoring us.
[01:46:40.726 --> 01:46:46.634]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:46:46.935 --> 01:46:49.959]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[01:47:04.733 --> 01:47:10.958]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.203 --> 01:47:17.924]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.505 --> 01:47:23.369]  Just a good old boy, never meanin' no harm.
[01:47:26.191 --> 01:47:30.695]  It's all you never saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[01:47:36.753 --> 01:47:40.354]  I'm a good old boy.
[01:47:40.394 --> 01:47:41.695]  My mama loves me.
[01:48:03.982 --> 01:48:06.403]  Nothing like some good old country on the open road, huh?
[01:48:07.123 --> 01:48:07.503]  Absolutely.
[01:48:07.523 --> 01:48:16.046]  You know, you ever see these guys that strut around, trying to act big and tough, and you look at them and it seems annoying, like they're, you know, trying to act like an alpha male?
[01:48:16.966 --> 01:48:20.288]  But, you know, maybe I was the person that was cowed.
[01:48:20.908 --> 01:48:23.929]  Because it's up to us that our alpha males actually care about society.
[01:48:24.249 --> 01:48:29.651]  They don't let the weird little twisted beta males, who crave power, dominate us.
[01:48:30.091 --> 01:48:32.032]  And they know that we have a conscience, so they manipulate us.
[01:48:32.052 --> 01:48:32.592]  So here's an example.
[01:48:33.436 --> 01:48:35.958]  I've got, and I'm not bragging about it, it's actually freakish.
[01:48:36.739 --> 01:48:40.401]  My neck is freakishly large, 20 inches, and it's not fat.
[01:48:40.822 --> 01:48:42.363]  And my chest is freakishly large.
[01:48:42.383 --> 01:48:44.584]  I mean, my chest is almost as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger's.
[01:48:45.045 --> 01:48:46.165]  Okay, then I got a big belly too.
[01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:48.787]  But the whole point is, is that ever since high school,
[01:48:49.668 --> 01:48:51.689]  Like, big tough guys would say, oh, you're a punk.
[01:48:51.749 --> 01:48:52.310]  You want to fight?
[01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:53.651]  Well, you walk around with your chest stuck out.
[01:48:53.711 --> 01:48:54.951]  I was like, no, I'm just standing up straight.
[01:48:54.992 --> 01:48:55.752]  My dad would say, stand up straight.
[01:48:56.052 --> 01:48:57.393]  If I stand up straight, it looks ridiculous.
[01:48:57.953 --> 01:49:03.837]  And so the point is, is that my, so since I was a teenager, I kind of like act like I'm a little wizard.
[01:49:03.857 --> 01:49:07.540]  You know, I walk around, I kind of just do like this so people don't recognize me or mess with me.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.403]  But you know what, now that people attack me, for the first time in my life, it's not an arrogance, it's a pride.
[01:49:12.923 --> 01:49:20.828]  Now, I went walking into a grocery store this morning, I actually walked like a man's supposed to walk, and everybody was looking at me, and they were like, damn, that guy looks like a badass.
[01:49:20.868 --> 01:49:25.891]  And the whole point was, all of that now is the fact they're attacking me, and I'm more proud than I've ever been.
[01:49:26.171 --> 01:49:31.795]  And I don't say like I was ashamed of myself before, I wasn't trying to stand out before, because I was already confident.
[01:49:32.515 --> 01:49:41.267]  But now that they want to come boo at me at tables and boo at me on the street and take that down and like, you know, just being like 18, try to make me ashamed of myself.
[01:49:42.268 --> 01:49:43.931]  Now, because they're doing that.
[01:49:45.413 --> 01:49:47.956]  Now, now I'm going to actually hold my head up.
[01:49:48.156 --> 01:49:48.577]  So now.
[01:49:49.537 --> 01:49:55.642]  I walked into a hotel the other night to this interview, and I walked right in there, and I walked in there with my head up, chest out, everything else.
[01:49:56.143 --> 01:49:57.764]  Every woman basically came running.
[01:49:58.364 --> 01:50:01.887]  And again, it's not bragging about, oh, I'm this tough guy, I'm handsome.
[01:50:01.947 --> 01:50:02.388]  It's not that.
[01:50:02.568 --> 01:50:03.189]  It's confidence.
[01:50:03.469 --> 01:50:07.852]  It's that America has the will, has the spirit, has the destiny, has the future.
[01:50:08.673 --> 01:50:14.916]  But those of us that are strong, we are reserved, because we're almost embarrassed by our power.
[01:50:15.496 --> 01:50:17.116]  And I'm saying, now's the time to use the power.
[01:50:17.156 --> 01:50:20.398]  So from now on, I'm not walking around hunchback, trying to hide anymore.
[01:50:20.638 --> 01:50:24.119]  I'm gonna walk around, not sticking my chest out, but just standing up straight.
[01:50:24.139 --> 01:50:25.820]  This is what I look like when I stand up straight.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:26.520]  Okay?
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.362]  I'm gonna start walking around like this, because I'm proud of what I've done.
[01:50:30.402 --> 01:50:31.602]  People say, oh, you're a loser.
[01:50:31.842 --> 01:50:33.203]  Oh, you've been deplatformed, Owen.
[01:50:34.103 --> 01:50:41.467]  Oh, Trump's being, it's all this lie that Trump's fake, Trump's not real, Trump's an idiot, Trump stands for nothing, because he stands for everything!
[01:50:42.508 --> 01:50:43.869]  It's all a damn lie!
[01:50:43.889 --> 01:50:45.370]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:50.833]  Well, and if they think we're going to stop because they're going to try to de-platform us, then they don't understand what
[01:50:50.913 --> 01:50:51.513]  We're doing here.
[01:50:51.533 --> 01:50:52.714]  They don't understand our mission.
[01:50:52.754 --> 01:50:54.255]  They don't understand what we're fighting for.
[01:50:54.275 --> 01:50:55.415]  We're not fighting for attention.
[01:50:55.435 --> 01:50:56.356]  We're not fighting for fame.
[01:50:56.376 --> 01:50:57.316]  We're not fighting for fortune.
[01:50:57.336 --> 01:50:58.277]  We're fighting for freedom.
[01:50:58.297 --> 01:50:59.157]  We're fighting for truth.
[01:50:59.357 --> 01:51:00.278]  We're fighting for America.
[01:51:00.298 --> 01:51:01.178]  We're fighting for justice.
[01:51:01.198 --> 01:51:04.640]  We're fighting for common sense to return to this country.
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:06.521]  But Alex, I mean, you are a badass.
[01:51:06.541 --> 01:51:07.922]  You don't have to say, uh, I'm kind of bad.
[01:51:07.962 --> 01:51:09.503]  You, you are a badass.
[01:51:09.523 --> 01:51:12.164]  I've had my ass kicked plenty of times, usually, but usually when I was in the wrong.
[01:51:12.184 --> 01:51:13.405]  But the point is, is that
[01:51:15.005 --> 01:51:17.347]  It's not like I'm even embarrassed, it's like I don't want attention.
[01:51:18.007 --> 01:51:23.429]  But people always ask me, it's like, how can you go into a crowd of those people and... Because you have something, explain that.
[01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:25.851]  They think we're losing by being attacked by the world.
[01:51:26.071 --> 01:51:27.411]  We're here to change the world.
[01:51:27.692 --> 01:51:30.793]  And I'm not comparing myself to Christ, but we're all trying to be Christ-like.
[01:51:31.073 --> 01:51:35.455]  Christ came to stand up and say no to the power structure and then put it all on the line as an example.
[01:51:35.735 --> 01:51:36.636]  And that's what we're supposed to do.
[01:51:37.356 --> 01:51:38.417]  People say we're losing.
[01:51:38.477 --> 01:51:39.997]  No, we're dominating.
[01:51:40.257 --> 01:51:41.638]  We're blitzing the hell out of them.
[01:51:41.658 --> 01:51:42.358]  Explain that to them.
[01:51:42.579 --> 01:51:47.421]  Explain how you march into crowds of these people that hate you and lie about you because you're trying to save them.
[01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:49.282]  You know what they're saying is a fraud.
[01:51:49.462 --> 01:51:53.104]  Just like Hitler said America sucked and the Japanese said America was bad.
[01:51:53.164 --> 01:51:54.384]  No, we didn't start those wars.
[01:51:54.944 --> 01:51:56.245]  And we weren't perfect with the idea.
[01:51:56.465 --> 01:51:57.766]  Of course Hitler said we were bad.
[01:51:58.246 --> 01:52:04.113]  You think my grandfathers or your great-grandfathers listened to Axis power BS?
[01:52:04.593 --> 01:52:06.515]  You think they heard the broadcast that came in?
[01:52:07.096 --> 01:52:08.097]  They laughed at it!
[01:52:08.838 --> 01:52:12.722]  We should laugh at these people too, but they're an enemy within trying to suppress us.
[01:52:13.263 --> 01:52:28.850]  Well, it's really easy to be confident going into a group of these people, unfortunately, because if you arm yourself with the truth, if you arm yourself with information, and more importantly, if you arm yourself with Jesus and God, and you go into these crowds, you cannot be defeated.
[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:32.651]  As long as you don't back down and have confidence, you cannot be defeated by these people.
[01:52:33.011 --> 01:52:37.232]  And they probably think that they had some sort of faux victory over kicking me out.
[01:52:37.272 --> 01:52:37.812]  Well, guess what?
[01:52:37.832 --> 01:52:44.274]  I had a viral video that's going to be seen a million times, and your little event will have no impact on the world.
[01:52:44.614 --> 01:52:47.415]  And so they have these faux victories, but if you just go into these... Well, that's it!
[01:52:47.535 --> 01:52:52.196]  They're all about how they're winners and we're losers, and they follow every tyrannical program.
[01:52:53.758 --> 01:52:55.180]  They're not liberals, they're authoritarians.
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:53:05.113]  And the only reason I told the story about my life, like not trying to walk around, you know, like you walk around the grocery store standing up straight, and it's kind of embarrassing, you know, to like walk around like you're trying to be one of those big guys.
[01:53:05.333 --> 01:53:07.096]  But I am a big guy, so I shouldn't be embarrassed of it.
[01:53:07.276 --> 01:53:09.479]  And I'm just saying, I'm not going to hunch over and hide anymore.
[01:53:09.679 --> 01:53:11.862]  But they've actually made me come out of my shell.
[01:53:12.162 --> 01:53:19.067]  Actually, this is an interesting path to go down, Alex, because there's this whole trend right now happening about body shaming, right?
[01:53:19.487 --> 01:53:36.858]  And so, it's like, if you're overweight and obese, like, they want you to show off your body, like, I mean, women are wearing, like, yoga pants now that, I mean, it should almost be illegal, but, like, if you're actually in shape, like a fit guy, like, sometimes, Alex, it's, like, weird, like, I feel bad, like, if I go out in a muscle shirt, walking... Because you're in great shape.
[01:53:37.139 --> 01:53:39.100]  And there's, like, a bunch of... What are you, like, 3% body fat?
[01:53:40.007 --> 01:53:52.395]  Probably something like that, maybe four or five, depending on the day, but it's like, if you walk around in a muscle shirt and you're a big tough guy or whatever, like, you're kind of like, like, oh yeah, thanks for rubbing it in, you know what I'm saying?
[01:53:52.615 --> 01:54:01.781]  But if you're someone overweight that just chooses to be overweight and then chooses to, you know, scoot around on the store on your scooter instead of walking and stuff like that, like... Oh, it's like going to the Antifa meetings.
[01:54:02.322 --> 01:54:07.485]  These women go, I love Satan, I kill my babies and I stink, and they hold their arms up and just blubber and like,
[01:54:09.027 --> 01:54:13.254]  You're not supposed to be proud of your physical condition if it's good.
[01:54:13.274 --> 01:54:17.380]  You're only supposed to be proud and boast about your physical condition if it's unhealthy.
[01:54:20.922 --> 01:54:25.646]  I was real good-looking when I was young, and so I noticed men started fights with me if I was good-looking and strutting around.
[01:54:25.666 --> 01:54:26.707]  I wasn't trying to strut.
[01:54:26.787 --> 01:54:28.709]  I learned to not strut around because I don't want attention.
[01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:34.114]  And I'm just saying, now, with all the things it's like in this climate, now I'm going to start strutting around.
[01:54:34.795 --> 01:54:41.521]  Because I want those people to know that I'm going to strut around in front of them because I'm not going to bow to them.
[01:54:41.721 --> 01:54:42.402]  And here's what it is.
[01:54:42.762 --> 01:54:44.143]  Everyone is Alex Jones now.
[01:54:44.323 --> 01:54:45.044]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:54:45.064 --> 01:54:45.884]  You are Alex Jones.
[01:54:45.904 --> 01:54:47.626]  You have to go to these events.
[01:54:47.886 --> 01:54:55.852]  One patriot armed with the truth, armed with information, armed with facts, and armed with God, will defeat an entire crowd of these people.
[01:54:56.233 --> 01:55:01.517]  And I bet of the 50 people that were at that event last night, I bet you I changed one person's mind, Alex.
[01:55:01.597 --> 01:55:06.501]  I bet you one person in that 50 people's... I think more than that, because they all deep down know it's a lie.
[01:55:06.781 --> 01:55:08.402]  They know America doesn't hate Hispanics.
[01:55:08.662 --> 01:55:10.082]  They know Latin America is collapsing.
[01:55:10.102 --> 01:55:12.083]  They know it's a dangerous, satanic war zone.
[01:55:12.423 --> 01:55:15.445]  And then how the hell can they come up with this and say that we're the bad guys?
[01:55:15.565 --> 01:55:16.365]  Well, what are we going to do?
[01:55:16.405 --> 01:55:20.427]  I mean, how can I compete, you know, Beto O'Rourke, a fake name.
[01:55:20.487 --> 01:55:24.769]  They put Beto in his name to, you know, make him, you know, votable.
[01:55:24.869 --> 01:55:27.030]  They think Hispanics will just, oh, vote, vote, vote.
[01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:28.330]  It's like Sylvia Garcia.
[01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.950]  Is that your real name?
[01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:29.611]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:55:29.691 --> 01:55:32.252]  These Democrats, they always manipulate anyway to get votes.
[01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:35.413]  Beto O'Rourke plays a concert with Willie Nelson.
[01:55:35.433 --> 01:55:39.955]  So Willie Nelson is now promoting Beto O'Rourke to defeat Ted Cruz, which is bad.
[01:55:39.995 --> 01:55:41.255]  Ted Cruz is a great voting record.
[01:55:41.476 --> 01:55:46.398]  Beto O'Rourke is an anti-conservative, anti-Trump, liberal nutjob, phony Democrat.
[01:55:46.578 --> 01:55:47.298]  So what am I going to do?
[01:55:47.358 --> 01:55:48.599]  I can't compete with Willie Nelson.
[01:55:48.779 --> 01:55:49.199]  Wait a second.
[01:55:49.239 --> 01:55:49.979]  Maybe I can.
[01:55:50.119 --> 01:55:50.819]  I have to.
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.620]  I have to compete with Willie Nelson.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.581]  I have to make sure that Ted Cruz gets in.
[01:55:54.601 --> 01:55:56.802]  Not because I'm some fanatic of Ted Cruz.
[01:55:57.082 --> 01:55:58.843]  Because he's going to vote for America!
[01:55:59.443 --> 01:56:00.623]  Because he's gonna be real!
[01:56:00.703 --> 01:56:03.024]  Beto is a literal moron idiot.
[01:56:03.224 --> 01:56:04.945]  And everyone must vote for Ted Cruz.
[01:56:04.985 --> 01:56:09.046]  Ted Cruz got dirty in the campaign, which made me hate him more because he was so good at his voting record.
[01:56:09.246 --> 01:56:10.027]  He's so smart.
[01:56:10.147 --> 01:56:11.307]  He really has one of the best voting records.
[01:56:11.327 --> 01:56:13.608]  And then he turned into this lying jerk during the campaign.
[01:56:13.628 --> 01:56:14.048]  It doesn't matter.
[01:56:14.328 --> 01:56:16.429]  He's a trillion times better than Beto.
[01:56:16.689 --> 01:56:16.969]  Bingo.
[01:56:17.549 --> 01:56:17.869]  Bingo.
[01:56:18.069 --> 01:56:20.151]  And that's why this midterm election is so important.
[01:56:20.751 --> 01:56:25.655]  Just, and even if you have to hold your nose and vote Republican, look, I'm not a Republican, but my God!
[01:56:25.675 --> 01:56:26.616]  But you can't hold your nose.
[01:56:26.656 --> 01:56:27.976]  The Democrats are pure evil.
[01:56:28.017 --> 01:56:29.558]  Let me plug, we're going to go bankrupt here.
[01:56:29.598 --> 01:56:30.438]  Because this is important.
[01:56:30.478 --> 01:56:31.259]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:56:31.279 --> 01:56:31.999]  We have another guest joining us.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:34.941]  Folks, just like our information is game-changing,
[01:56:35.942 --> 01:56:37.044]  Our products are game-changing.
[01:56:37.805 --> 01:56:39.708]  I put out Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:41.731]  It's got 95% curcuminoid.
[01:56:42.212 --> 01:56:43.494]  I got one of the top labs in the country.
[01:56:43.514 --> 01:56:45.757]  Even concentrate more, they can barely do it at 95%.
[01:56:46.017 --> 01:56:48.521]  I want you to have the best, okay?
[01:56:48.561 --> 01:56:49.703]  Well, it's the same thing with X2.
[01:56:49.723 --> 01:56:51.365]  It's the purest iodine out there, and yes,
[01:56:52.571 --> 01:56:54.733]  Like I told you six months ago, I did a big order.
[01:56:54.833 --> 01:56:55.834]  I tried to get the price down.
[01:56:56.154 --> 01:56:57.755]  These oil companies have been gouging us.
[01:56:58.356 --> 01:56:59.337]  It is cost prohibitive.
[01:56:59.357 --> 01:57:00.578]  They have slowdowns.
[01:57:00.598 --> 01:57:01.278]  They're messing with me.
[01:57:01.298 --> 01:57:03.140]  That's where it comes from, deep earth mining.
[01:57:04.161 --> 01:57:05.722]  This is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[01:57:06.102 --> 01:57:08.124]  So, we hope there's a new formulation.
[01:57:08.164 --> 01:57:12.928]  We hope we're able to get a source, but I just get tired of being put over a barrel and, you know, them taking six months to get it to us.
[01:57:12.968 --> 01:57:15.350]  So, it'll be a long time until we get more X2 in if we ever do.
[01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:16.231]  I think this is the last run.
[01:57:16.251 --> 01:57:19.414]  I think technically if you get a new supplier, you got to change the name anyway.
[01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:27.511]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:27.852 --> 01:57:32.013]  Infowarsstore.com, get your X2 before it's all sold out.
[01:57:32.093 --> 01:57:34.173]  Final run of X2, the amazing product.
[01:57:34.213 --> 01:57:36.154]  Infowarslife.com, a lot of other specials there as well.
[01:57:36.534 --> 01:57:42.255]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off, and you can also get a lot of other great products and t-shirts, books, you name it.
[01:57:42.635 --> 01:57:45.276]  Or you can let Soros gang-rape your entire culture.
[01:57:45.476 --> 01:57:46.376]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:57:56.203 --> 01:58:02.348]  Realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world.
[01:58:03.389 --> 01:58:06.752]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:58:07.192 --> 01:58:15.579]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:58:15.919 --> 01:58:20.162]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:58:20.483 --> 01:58:21.443]  You are the Infowarrior.
[01:58:21.944 --> 01:58:25.467]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:58:26.127 --> 01:58:37.736]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:37.796 --> 01:58:47.703]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:48.283 --> 01:58:48.944]  We're good to go.
[01:59:07.978 --> 01:59:11.079]  We are following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:59:11.459 --> 01:59:13.520]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:14.001 --> 01:59:18.943]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is, or what sex we are, or where we came from.
[01:59:19.503 --> 01:59:27.166]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:27.666 --> 01:59:34.369]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:36.070]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:36.630 --> 01:59:38.050]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:39.891]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:40.531 --> 01:59:42.171]  And many others are across the world.
[01:59:42.431 --> 01:59:43.191]  We are the future.
[01:59:44.132 --> 01:59:45.052]  We are the renaissance.
[01:59:45.612 --> 01:59:46.892]  And we are winning.
[01:59:48.212 --> 02:00:02.715]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:03.276 --> 02:00:04.976]  You gotta keep them separated.
[02:00:18.011 --> 02:00:24.095]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:25.075 --> 02:00:26.877]  Civilization's great.
[02:00:35.029 --> 02:00:44.596]  Chivalry is great, but they took Christian chivalry, and the globalists use it to get us to advocate our responsibility and let them take control, when they're totally ruthless, and they're fundamentally betas.
[02:00:45.477 --> 02:00:48.319]  Twisted betas is what I call them, so they want to dominate strength.
[02:00:48.899 --> 02:00:54.243]  And you look at this, one of the last issues of InfoWorks Magazine, it was a great success, it's just time and energy, we couldn't do it anymore.
[02:00:54.924 --> 02:00:57.586]  The War on Men, this came out like three years ago.
[02:00:58.513 --> 02:01:00.697]  Now it's all totally public.
[02:01:01.298 --> 02:01:03.161]  It's all totally admitted, Owen.
[02:01:03.502 --> 02:01:06.387]  So in closing, before our next guest joins us with some key information...
[02:01:09.659 --> 02:01:12.180]  I've looked at all angles on this, and tell me if you disagree.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:18.502]  They can't get rid of Trump now, because it will derail them even more, as a lot of top globalists like Panetta and others and Hayden have warned them.
[02:01:18.522 --> 02:01:20.543]  But that's not who they're listening to.
[02:01:20.783 --> 02:01:27.486]  The Deep State, the Chi-Coms, others, Juncker, they think they're invincible because they had power so long.
[02:01:27.586 --> 02:01:29.007]  Yeah, because we were asleep.
[02:01:29.807 --> 02:01:32.408]  And so they keep trying to intimidate, like Hitler bombing London.
[02:01:32.548 --> 02:01:35.049]  It doesn't intimidate, it pisses people off.
[02:01:36.093 --> 02:01:43.237]  And energetically, you can feel the rage, the focus, but they're trying to cause a violent revolution.
[02:01:43.257 --> 02:01:45.818]  Trump derangement syndrome has gone into overdrive now.
[02:01:47.339 --> 02:01:52.482]  And just the next 54 days are so incredibly critical for everybody to realize how important they are.
[02:01:52.862 --> 02:01:57.805]  They think we're a bunch of betas, where if they take us off this, take us off that, we all get demoralized and go away.
[02:01:57.845 --> 02:01:59.486]  No, we fight that much harder.
[02:01:59.766 --> 02:02:02.928]  They're trying to deplatform us because they can't beat us intellectually.
[02:02:03.388 --> 02:02:04.589]  So just in the three minutes we have left,
[02:02:05.543 --> 02:02:06.764]  Let's not be too confident, though.
[02:02:07.465 --> 02:02:08.446]  What do we have to watch?
[02:02:08.526 --> 02:02:09.547]  What's their curveballs?
[02:02:11.029 --> 02:02:12.530]  What's that shot coming from nowhere?
[02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:13.791]  What do they got up their sleeve?
[02:02:14.992 --> 02:02:20.878]  Well, the violence is something that they've already been doing, so maybe they continue to try to ratchet that up.
[02:02:25.698 --> 02:02:27.919]  If you're a radio listener, you have to see this.
[02:02:27.939 --> 02:02:29.659]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:29.699 --> 02:02:38.883]  I think that it's more of a battle for the future right now, where they want to scare and intimidate anybody in the future from running for office as a Republican.
[02:02:38.923 --> 02:02:44.865]  That's why they're stabbing Republicans, threatening to stab Republicans, shooting Republicans, stalking Republicans.
[02:02:44.905 --> 02:02:47.105]  That's why you've got all the violence against Trump supporters.
[02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:50.767]  That Breitbart 567, we've sent them dozens that they don't have on there.
[02:02:50.787 --> 02:02:51.427]  They don't put them on there.
[02:02:51.607 --> 02:02:53.548]  Well, actually, I got in touch with the guy.
[02:02:53.568 --> 02:03:01.750]  He did put two of ours on there, and then the problem was, the others that I sent him were removed from YouTube, and so they liked them.
[02:03:01.770 --> 02:03:04.151]  And that's what they target is showing how horrid the left is.
[02:03:04.171 --> 02:03:05.172]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:03:05.212 --> 02:03:07.152]  Which is, of course... All their misbehavior!
[02:03:07.452 --> 02:03:12.994]  Which was the last videos that were up on the Alex Jones Channel before they removed you before you went live that day.
[02:03:13.334 --> 02:03:16.255]  So we need to re-upload those on our own platform.
[02:03:16.335 --> 02:03:18.096]  Well, and then I did that, and then they banned me!
[02:03:19.175 --> 02:03:26.042]  Which, which, I mean, you know, so it's fine, but that's why, and Alex, again, this is why I started the InfoWars.
[02:03:26.062 --> 02:03:28.684]  Well, there's no shortage of these miscreants, though.
[02:03:28.725 --> 02:03:34.010]  People need to understand, okay, alright, if they remove Alex Jones' voice box, you are Alex Jones.
[02:03:34.050 --> 02:03:35.131]  You have to go be Alex Jones.
[02:03:35.151 --> 02:03:36.292]  By the way, we're not just saying that.
[02:03:36.352 --> 02:03:38.114]  They've bet they can silence you.
[02:03:38.174 --> 02:03:41.597]  They've bet that when they try to ban you or mess with you, you'll go away.
[02:03:41.657 --> 02:03:41.757]  No.
[02:03:42.418 --> 02:03:43.779]  Right on the bathroom wall!
[02:03:44.199 --> 02:03:45.159]  We're in a war, folks.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:46.140]  You know, don't think it's illegal.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:49.022]  Don't climb on billboards at night and spray and print InfoWars.com over it.
[02:03:49.042 --> 02:03:51.443]  I mean, it's time to get aggressive, folks.
[02:03:52.711 --> 02:03:54.072]  It's time for civil disobedience.
[02:03:54.332 --> 02:04:04.017]  They are not allowing you, they are not allowing us, they're not allowing Alex, heck, they're not even allowing Trump and Republicans from getting a fair shake on the digital platform.
[02:04:04.377 --> 02:04:05.398]  It's really not even close.
[02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:06.258]  So what do we do?
[02:04:06.298 --> 02:04:12.842]  Well, let's go out into the real world, where God is in charge, the 3D realm, our creator, and let's see if they want to try to banish from that.
[02:04:13.082 --> 02:04:16.424]  Because then that becomes a national news story, and then that fires up the base even more.
[02:04:16.564 --> 02:04:20.148]  You're gonna ban people from putting up a free Alex Jones sign at a public event?
[02:04:20.468 --> 02:04:20.749]  Huh.
[02:04:21.069 --> 02:04:25.213]  Wow, we've really reached next level Chinese totalitarianism then, haven't we?
[02:04:25.394 --> 02:04:36.406]  And you've just created a story, and then we can force the mainstream news to cover it, because it doesn't matter how many platforms they erase us from, this show at InfoWars.com still has millions of unique visitors every day.
[02:04:37.246 --> 02:04:39.368]  And then they're more activated, they're more energized.
[02:04:39.568 --> 02:04:43.610]  And I've always just tried to educate the general public, but now I've gotten even smarter.
[02:04:44.231 --> 02:04:46.993]  I just go directly, now that I have the big enough name to do it.
[02:04:47.653 --> 02:04:51.195]  But you don't, you know the policy makers know I'm dangerous to globals.
[02:04:51.215 --> 02:04:53.197]  They don't think I'm an idiot, like the liberals do.
[02:04:53.237 --> 02:04:53.997]  No, they listen.
[02:04:54.237 --> 02:04:55.478]  They don't want you in D.C., do they?
[02:04:55.498 --> 02:04:57.139]  No, we're going to be there a lot now.
[02:04:57.179 --> 02:04:57.559]  We're coming.
[02:04:57.980 --> 02:04:58.540]  Oh, yes.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:04:59.521]  Oh, no.
[02:05:02.503 --> 02:05:02.683]  Now!
[02:05:04.957 --> 02:05:06.318]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:05:07.919 --> 02:05:10.021]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:05:10.281 --> 02:05:11.362]  I believe in you!
[02:05:11.702 --> 02:05:12.903]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:05:14.725 --> 02:05:17.547]  One man, Everett's a woman!
[02:05:17.907 --> 02:05:19.489]  Old genitals were cut off!
[02:05:19.769 --> 02:05:22.171]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:05:22.311 --> 02:05:23.532]  And we're not backing down, ever!
[02:05:24.813 --> 02:05:26.574]  I'm gonna kick these people!
[02:05:26.634 --> 02:05:27.155]  We're winning!
[02:05:27.215 --> 02:05:28.316]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:05:28.476 --> 02:05:28.936]  Can't you?
[02:05:29.216 --> 02:05:30.858]  We have broken their back!
[02:05:31.218 --> 02:05:32.339]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:36.515]  Let's go!
[02:05:36.535 --> 02:05:36.695]  Come on!
[02:05:36.715 --> 02:05:36.976]  Come on!
[02:05:37.116 --> 02:05:37.336]  Come on!
[02:05:38.137 --> 02:05:38.317]  Come on!
[02:05:38.337 --> 02:05:38.537]  Come on!
[02:05:38.557 --> 02:05:38.797]  Come on!
[02:05:38.817 --> 02:05:39.037]  Come on!
[02:05:39.057 --> 02:05:39.277]  Come on!
[02:05:39.358 --> 02:05:39.558]  Come on!
[02:05:39.578 --> 02:05:39.898]  Come on!
[02:05:40.018 --> 02:05:40.178]  Come on!
[02:05:40.198 --> 02:05:40.418]  Come on!
[02:05:40.438 --> 02:05:40.739]  Come on!
[02:05:40.759 --> 02:05:40.919]  Come on!
[02:05:40.939 --> 02:05:41.099]  Come on!
[02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:41.459]  Come on!
[02:05:41.499 --> 02:05:41.859]  Come on!
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:42.020]  Come on!
[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:42.200]  Come on!
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:42.500]  Come on!
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:42.780]  Come on!
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:43.060]  Come on!
[02:05:43.161 --> 02:05:43.381]  Come on!
[02:05:43.401 --> 02:05:43.561]  Come on!
[02:05:43.581 --> 02:05:43.721]  Come on!
[02:05:43.741 --> 02:05:43.881]  Come on!
[02:05:43.901 --> 02:05:44.041]  Come on!
[02:05:44.061 --> 02:05:44.241]  Come on!
[02:05:44.261 --> 02:05:44.422]  Come on!
[02:05:44.462 --> 02:05:45.142]  Come on!
[02:05:45.222 --> 02:05:46.143]  Come on!
[02:05:46.223 --> 02:05:46.423]  Come on!
[02:05:46.543 --> 02:05:46.683]  Come on!
[02:05:46.703 --> 02:05:47.404]  Come on!
[02:05:47.564 --> 02:05:48.024]  Come on!
[02:05:48.044 --> 02:05:48.184]  Come on!
[02:05:48.204 --> 02:05:48.385]  Come on!
[02:05:48.405 --> 02:05:48.545]  Come on!
[02:05:48.565 --> 02:05:48.805]  Come on!
[02:05:48.825 --> 02:05:49.065]  Come on!
[02:05:49.185 --> 02:05:49.485]  Come on!
[02:05:49.526 --> 02:05:49.866]  Come on!
[02:05:49.926 --> 02:05:50.166]  Come on!
[02:05:50.186 --> 02:05:50.386]  Come on!
[02:05:50.506 --> 02:05:50.746]  Come on!
[02:05:50.967 --> 02:05:51.227]  Come on!
[02:05:51.247 --> 02:05:51.487]  Come on!
[02:05:51.607 --> 02:05:51.987]  Come on!
[02:05:52.007 --> 02:05:52.328]  Come on!
[02:05:52.348 --> 02:05:52.568]  Come on!
[02:05:52.608 --> 02:05:52.828]  Come on!
[02:05:52.848 --> 02:05:53.168]  Come on!
[02:05:53.188 --> 02:05:53.329]  Come on!
[02:05:53.349 --> 02:05:53.489]  Come on!
[02:05:53.509 --> 02:05:53.769]  Come on!
[02:05:53.789 --> 02:05:54.009]  Come on!
[02:05:54.049 --> 02:05:54.329]  Come on!
[02:05:54.449 --> 02:05:54.690]  Come on!
[02:05:54.710 --> 02:05:54.970]  Come on!
[02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:55.410]  Come on!
[02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.630]  Come on!
[02:05:55.710 --> 02:05:55.931]  Come on!
[02:05:55.951 --> 02:05:56.191]  Come on!
[02:05:56.211 --> 02:05:56.391]  Come on!
[02:05:56.471 --> 02:05:56.731]  Come on!
[02:05:56.771 --> 02:05:56.971]  Come on!
[02:05:56.991 --> 02:05:57.152]  Come on!
[02:05:57.172 --> 02:05:57.432]  Come on!
[02:05:57.452 --> 02:05:57.732]  Come on!
[02:05:57.752 --> 02:05:57.992]  Come on!
[02:05:58.072 --> 02:05:58.232]  Come on!
[02:05:58.252 --> 02:05:58.433]  Come on!
[02:05:58.453 --> 02:05:58.633]  Come on!
[02:05:58.653 --> 02:05:58.773]  Come
[02:06:13.217 --> 02:06:16.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:17.301 --> 02:06:19.003]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.009 --> 02:06:34.170]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:35.010]  Never!
[02:06:35.230 --> 02:06:41.232]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[02:06:41.352 --> 02:06:41.712]  No!
[02:06:41.752 --> 02:06:54.315]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:06:55.652 --> 02:06:56.693]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:06:56.913 --> 02:07:05.637]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[02:07:05.697 --> 02:07:09.599]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:15.242 --> 02:07:24.608]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[02:07:24.889 --> 02:07:30.332]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[02:07:33.634 --> 02:07:39.177]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[02:07:41.739 --> 02:07:42.960]  They falsely edited him.
[02:07:45.475 --> 02:07:47.999]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:07:49.501 --> 02:07:53.086]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:07:55.589 --> 02:08:00.096]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:08:01.599 --> 02:08:06.043]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:08:06.383 --> 02:08:08.606]  And then we get hit and say, you know, don't use our software.
[02:08:09.767 --> 02:08:12.609]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:08:13.130 --> 02:08:14.711]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:08:14.751 --> 02:08:15.592]  They just killed our stream.
[02:08:16.793 --> 02:08:17.113]  Really?
[02:08:17.253 --> 02:08:17.514]  Yep.
[02:08:17.634 --> 02:08:20.176]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:08:21.898 --> 02:08:22.839]  This is America in 2018.
[02:08:26.055 --> 02:08:31.456]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:08:33.677 --> 02:08:37.618]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:08:38.158 --> 02:08:39.878]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:08:40.599 --> 02:08:47.560]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:08:48.541 --> 02:08:53.482]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:17.791 --> 02:09:21.492]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:09:33.917 --> 02:09:38.179]  This is the most banned, demonized, lied about broadcast in the world.
[02:09:38.299 --> 02:09:40.840]  Before I introduce my special guest, a really smart guy that's impressive.
[02:09:42.014 --> 02:09:43.916]  I thought about saying this at the start of the show today, but I didn't do it.
[02:09:44.896 --> 02:09:49.039]  When I had Eric Bolling here of CRTV and formerly Fox News, really nice guy.
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:50.100]  Smart guy.
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:51.221]  Big economist.
[02:09:52.462 --> 02:09:53.443]  Big buddies with Trump.
[02:09:53.863 --> 02:09:55.424]  We're having some great off-record conversations.
[02:09:56.445 --> 02:10:01.409]  That horrifies Southern Property Law Center and Soros and all of them.
[02:10:01.429 --> 02:10:02.850]  He talks to the President basically every day.
[02:10:05.396 --> 02:10:10.520]  He was going, you know, they admitted Homeland was about you, and this other show, and another show, and like Off Air.
[02:10:11.341 --> 02:10:13.343]  And again, it's not about how I'm a big guy.
[02:10:13.403 --> 02:10:21.630]  It's like, why did they start, when Hillary lost, producing three Comedy Central shows, admittedly based on me, but to misrepresent what I've said?
[02:10:22.330 --> 02:10:24.411]  I'm Alex Jones and I love the KKK!
[02:10:24.431 --> 02:10:26.792]  You know, that's Stephen Colbert two weeks ago.
[02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:31.193]  But then I'm banned off the internet, all these platforms, so I can't say that's ridiculous.
[02:10:31.453 --> 02:10:35.655]  Here I am protesting the KKK and saying I love Martin Luther King and what he said.
[02:10:37.855 --> 02:10:39.756]  That's the craziness we're dealing with here.
[02:10:40.316 --> 02:10:42.777]  So that's why they're taking me off all these things so I can't respond.
[02:10:42.797 --> 02:10:47.779]  But it had the Streisand effect, kind of like you have a water balloon and you push this way onto social media, it gets big.
[02:10:48.059 --> 02:10:51.240]  You take conservatives off or free thinkers off, it goes back the other way.
[02:10:52.048 --> 02:10:54.950]  And so they took us off here, and all the traffic went back over here.
[02:10:56.311 --> 02:10:57.992]  And about 7% extra.
[02:10:59.333 --> 02:11:06.578]  Well, if you count the first month, it's like three times, but... But it's true that it makes it hard for us to reach new people.
[02:11:07.579 --> 02:11:07.779]  So...
[02:11:09.281 --> 02:11:14.082]  That's why I'm getting into the fact that why would they build me up like this?
[02:11:14.102 --> 02:11:20.423]  Because sure, I had one of the biggest radio shows and one of the biggest websites out there, thanks to you and Drudge Report and all the guests.
[02:11:20.443 --> 02:11:22.323]  I mean, InfoWars is you, it's not just me.
[02:11:23.203 --> 02:11:24.204]  But why did they ban it?
[02:11:24.224 --> 02:11:28.324]  Because if you understand that, you understand like the Rosetta Stone, the Skeleton Key, it opens all the doors.
[02:11:29.364 --> 02:11:37.146]  Well, they admit in these white papers and these WikiLeaks documents and these latest Media Matters documents that came out from last year but came out a few months ago that got national news.
[02:11:37.266 --> 02:11:38.166]  They're playing.
[02:11:39.488 --> 02:11:40.970]  It's a big report we've covered.
[02:11:42.351 --> 02:11:46.574]  They picked me because I could be taken out of context, and they thought I was an easy target.
[02:11:47.814 --> 02:11:50.576]  So they built me up even bigger, and then it backfired.
[02:11:50.616 --> 02:11:52.618]  Folks love the radicalness.
[02:11:52.898 --> 02:11:58.102]  They loved even the villainous, you know, everybody knows in professional wrestling, the villain's the most popular.
[02:11:58.362 --> 02:12:00.984]  I'm not really a villain, but they made me into a villain.
[02:12:01.064 --> 02:12:02.425]  These globalists have some blind spots.
[02:12:02.965 --> 02:12:05.127]  We got even more popular, especially with young people.
[02:12:07.225 --> 02:12:11.230]  So even though I'm not that villain, now they've got to destroy me.
[02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:13.452]  They're like, oh my god, we built Frankenstein.
[02:12:14.994 --> 02:12:16.155]  And they don't know what to do.
[02:12:16.215 --> 02:12:17.997]  But again, they're still missing.
[02:12:18.178 --> 02:12:18.858]  It's the guest.
[02:12:18.938 --> 02:12:19.439]  It's you.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.301]  That's what's really powerful.
[02:12:22.293 --> 02:12:23.674]  And so that's why they're so scared.
[02:12:24.234 --> 02:12:32.140]  And that's why you shouldn't take it as like, oh my God, I got kicked off Facebook or Twitter or I got banned or I got whatever because I promoted Alex Jones.
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.282]  You're going to be kicked off anyways.
[02:12:34.982 --> 02:12:42.427]  The only work there is, is standing up for what's right and breaking their will and breaking their stock and supporting us.
[02:12:42.507 --> 02:12:49.712]  So when I do a straight up pitch, as my guest said, he doesn't want to come on here and do a pitch as a company I'm working with because they're so good.
[02:12:50.013 --> 02:12:51.454]  He said, I want to get into college scam.
[02:12:52.543 --> 02:13:01.871]  In a college conspiracy, which is one of my biggest issues, and I learned about from Limbaugh like 25 years ago when I was, you know, out of high school listening to him, I guess in college.
[02:13:02.591 --> 02:13:04.893]  So, we have our guest here.
[02:13:04.933 --> 02:13:05.814]  We're going to go to break.
[02:13:05.834 --> 02:13:06.594]  He's a surprise guest.
[02:13:06.634 --> 02:13:07.175]  I can tell you his name.
[02:13:07.195 --> 02:13:08.176]  If we go to break, come back in a moment.
[02:13:08.516 --> 02:13:10.097]  We're building the suspense here.
[02:13:11.779 --> 02:13:17.764]  But that's what this comes down to is they want you dependent.
[02:13:17.944 --> 02:13:19.125]  I had the guest on yesterday.
[02:13:20.451 --> 02:13:24.974]  Who has nine of his books, one of them a bestseller, banned on Amazon in one day.
[02:13:24.994 --> 02:13:27.256]  And I went and looked at the synopsis.
[02:13:27.296 --> 02:13:29.077]  I read one of the books years ago.
[02:13:29.698 --> 02:13:30.858]  It's just milquetoast.
[02:13:30.898 --> 02:13:32.339]  Don't let women push you around.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:34.401]  They're not looking for a guy that's a beta.
[02:13:34.421 --> 02:13:35.422]  Let's them push him around.
[02:13:35.782 --> 02:13:36.863]  You're not their child.
[02:13:37.243 --> 02:13:38.184]  You're not their son.
[02:13:38.604 --> 02:13:39.765]  You're their boyfriend.
[02:13:39.805 --> 02:13:40.585]  You're their husband.
[02:13:41.166 --> 02:13:43.287]  And how men need to be rugged again.
[02:13:43.827 --> 02:13:46.469]  Those books were banned because they were effective.
[02:13:46.990 --> 02:13:47.710]  They were true.
[02:13:49.331 --> 02:13:51.352]  And they were going to number one.
[02:13:52.713 --> 02:13:53.533]  So think about that.
[02:13:53.653 --> 02:13:55.874]  So they want to bring you failure.
[02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:59.276]  They want to bring you college degrees that are beyond worthless.
[02:13:59.376 --> 02:13:59.996]  They're a negative.
[02:14:00.016 --> 02:14:02.898]  You're going to pay $100,000 for it and you're going to be bagging groceries.
[02:14:03.358 --> 02:14:04.739]  There are some degrees that are worth something.
[02:14:05.119 --> 02:14:05.919]  We're going to get into those.
[02:14:06.059 --> 02:14:09.221]  So because it was my guest, I wanted him here because he's such a smart guy.
[02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:10.681]  He does such great work.
[02:14:11.502 --> 02:14:13.303]  But we'll introduce him when we come back in the next segment.
[02:14:13.343 --> 02:14:14.263]  I'm building a suspense here.
[02:14:17.072 --> 02:14:18.315]  I want to empower you.
[02:14:18.816 --> 02:14:26.532]  I want you to be involved in things, whether they're supplements or information or whatever it is, that is so great for you.
[02:14:27.797 --> 02:14:30.138]  That we symbiotically have a future together.
[02:14:30.478 --> 02:14:31.278]  You want to come back.
[02:14:31.318 --> 02:14:33.519]  You want to get our products because they work so well for you.
[02:14:33.859 --> 02:14:37.861]  You want to come back because the information is so accurate on so many topics.
[02:14:37.901 --> 02:14:40.102]  You want to know what they don't want you to know.
[02:14:40.302 --> 02:14:41.162]  What scares them.
[02:14:42.083 --> 02:14:43.503]  And that's really why we're so banned.
[02:14:44.123 --> 02:14:46.024]  Our government really did sell out to Communist China.
[02:14:46.424 --> 02:14:50.166]  Apple and Google have moved there and are tax exempt and helped round up dissidents and kill them.
[02:14:51.408 --> 02:14:52.749]  People go, man, you better watch your ass.
[02:14:52.769 --> 02:14:53.329]  They'll come after you.
[02:14:53.349 --> 02:14:54.350]  They're trillion-dollar companies.
[02:14:54.370 --> 02:14:54.931]  No, I get it.
[02:14:55.611 --> 02:14:58.794]  I don't want to just be some timid soul that crouches down and licks their hand.
[02:15:00.415 --> 02:15:05.439]  So all I say is may your chains set lightly upon you, as Patrick Henry said, and give me liberty or give me death.
[02:15:05.479 --> 02:15:11.123]  So when we come back, Conrad Padilla, an amazing guy, I'll introduce him.
[02:15:12.124 --> 02:15:14.265]  We'll get into the college conspiracy and the scam.
[02:15:16.584 --> 02:15:25.053]  That avenues that are proven, proven, so that you can be way more successful than what they've charted out for you.
[02:15:25.093 --> 02:15:29.598]  Because, and there's just a microcosm, I was 20 years old when I started Access Television.
[02:15:30.933 --> 02:15:33.714]  Because I was two years in college, it was all a bunch of crap.
[02:15:34.234 --> 02:15:36.734]  And within a year, I was already on local radio.
[02:15:36.754 --> 02:15:38.095]  I said, I want to be a salesman too.
[02:15:38.655 --> 02:15:43.556]  And within a couple years, I was bringing in over a million dollars a year and able to build an operation.
[02:15:43.916 --> 02:15:44.696]  And that's what it's about.
[02:15:45.076 --> 02:15:47.457]  See, I'm not a globalist that wants to cut your legs off so I can be above you.
[02:15:47.977 --> 02:15:49.097]  I want to see you soar.
[02:15:49.677 --> 02:15:50.997]  Because I believe in the human spirit.
[02:15:51.618 --> 02:15:53.958]  I want to see you eclipse anything I've ever done.
[02:15:53.978 --> 02:15:56.699]  And we'll get into a big way for you to do that straight ahead.
[02:15:57.079 --> 02:15:58.179]  But it's up to you to take action.
[02:16:02.262 --> 02:16:03.542]  You are confident.
[02:16:08.424 --> 02:16:09.364]  You are unique.
[02:16:12.965 --> 02:16:14.585]  You are inspiring.
[02:16:17.446 --> 02:16:20.127]  And today, you will look your beautiful best.
[02:16:22.647 --> 02:16:29.769]  Instantly Ageless, an age-defying microcream that in less than two minutes restores the youthful appearance of your skin.
[02:16:31.346 --> 02:16:37.048]  Created to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, pores, and puffiness under the eyes.
[02:16:38.369 --> 02:16:38.909]  No needles.
[02:16:39.569 --> 02:16:40.110]  No pain.
[02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:43.171]  Just a happier, younger-looking you.
[02:16:44.371 --> 02:16:46.492]  To use, simply massage the packet.
[02:16:47.352 --> 02:16:50.834]  Dispense a small drop and lightly pat a thin layer to targeted areas.
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:56.183]  Leave the product damp on your skin and remain expressionless for two minutes while it dries.
[02:16:56.964 --> 02:16:59.406]  And if you missed a spot, it's easy to reapply.
[02:16:59.426 --> 02:17:04.350]  Or if you happen to apply too much, wet a cotton swab and gently remove any residue.
[02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:08.092]  Apply oil-free cosmetics and finish getting ready as usual.
[02:17:08.533 --> 02:17:09.393]  It's that simple.
[02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:18.841]  I've probably noticed in the past five years that my eyes have gained a lot of fine lines, wrinkles, my curls have gotten deeper.
[02:17:22.435 --> 02:17:22.695]  Wow.
[02:17:22.875 --> 02:17:25.876]  I was hoping for five years, but that's like what my eyes looked like ten years ago.
[02:17:26.956 --> 02:17:28.596]  That is really cool!
[02:17:29.496 --> 02:17:29.877]  Wrinkle?
[02:17:30.497 --> 02:17:30.817]  Gone?
[02:17:32.257 --> 02:17:32.637]  It's easy.
[02:17:32.657 --> 02:17:34.417]  You just put it on your finger and go.
[02:17:34.437 --> 02:17:36.978]  Now I wish I had more down here because I can still see one wrinkle.
[02:17:37.018 --> 02:17:37.578]  It's bugging me.
[02:17:38.578 --> 02:17:39.819]  I am a little bit emotional.
[02:17:40.399 --> 02:17:51.161]  Turning 40 I didn't think would be a big deal to me, but that looks like the me that I feel like inside instead of what I see when I look in the mirror.
[02:18:08.567 --> 02:18:11.150]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:16.617]  The social networking site permanently banning he and his media company, InfoWars.
[02:18:16.777 --> 02:18:19.020]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure.
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:24.466]  Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[02:18:25.227 --> 02:18:27.450]  Embrace wild conspiracy theories.
[02:18:27.550 --> 02:18:27.810]  Right.
[02:18:29.119 --> 02:18:30.379]  Those surrounding Benghazi.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:31.220]  You heard it.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.240]  Benghazi.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:33.941]  A wild conspiracy.
[02:18:33.981 --> 02:18:42.443]  In a blistering speech, former President Obama blasting the GOP over the Benghazi probe while he was in office, calling it a conspiracy theory.
[02:18:42.703 --> 02:18:48.225]  Again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and then something sprang out of that, an assault sprang out of that.
[02:18:48.745 --> 02:18:52.606]  And that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact.
[02:18:52.806 --> 02:18:54.867]  And the American people could have known that within days.
[02:18:55.067 --> 02:18:57.568]  What difference at this point does it make
[02:18:57.828 --> 02:18:58.389]  Former U.S.
[02:18:58.489 --> 02:19:03.813]  Army Ranger Chris Tantopronto was a CIA security contractor guarding the Benghazi annex.
[02:19:03.833 --> 02:19:04.793]  He joins us now.
[02:19:05.354 --> 02:19:06.294]  Chris, thanks for being here.
[02:19:06.394 --> 02:19:07.215]  You hear those words.
[02:19:07.415 --> 02:19:07.976]  Your reaction?
[02:19:08.216 --> 02:19:14.180]  It's completely offensive and it's something that I wish I had that man sitting in front of me right now.
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:14.841]  I really do.
[02:19:15.461 --> 02:19:16.502]  Without his Secret Service.
[02:19:16.742 --> 02:19:19.904]  Well, we'll be careful with that because he's a federal president.
[02:19:20.065 --> 02:19:24.588]  Twitter suspends Benghazi hero after criticism of the president who left him there to die.
[02:19:24.608 --> 02:19:25.809]  Basically tried to kill him.
[02:19:26.809 --> 02:19:37.934]  And if you talk to the person that killed your friends and tried to kill you and got caught lying about it, then you are the monster, you are the bad guy.
[02:19:37.994 --> 02:19:39.334]  That is truly sick.
[02:19:40.335 --> 02:19:41.635]  And now they've banned him.
[02:19:42.036 --> 02:19:48.378]  Well, we remember those men and what they did for this country, that sacrifice and the heroism there in Benghazi.
[02:19:48.418 --> 02:19:49.959]  Thank you for your service to this country.
[02:19:50.259 --> 02:19:51.019]  Chris, appreciate your time.
[02:19:51.039 --> 02:19:52.260]  We'll remember you this week.
[02:20:05.171 --> 02:20:16.559]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:24.044]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:28.752 --> 02:20:35.296]  Poets tell how Poncho fell, and left his living in a cheap hotel.
[02:20:36.356 --> 02:20:43.060]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, and so the story ends we're told.
[02:20:44.201 --> 02:20:50.584]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true, but save a few for Lefty too.
[02:20:51.825 --> 02:20:57.308]  He only did what he had to do, and now he's grown old.
[02:20:58.578 --> 02:21:00.279]  Hard to believe Merle Haggard died.
[02:21:00.319 --> 02:21:01.440]  Was it this year or last year?
[02:21:04.102 --> 02:21:04.822]  Last year.
[02:21:05.443 --> 02:21:06.643]  Conrad Padilla is here.
[02:21:06.783 --> 02:21:08.645]  I'm really impressed with how smart he is.
[02:21:09.045 --> 02:21:11.887]  And I've got him here because we're doing a business venture together.
[02:21:13.046 --> 02:21:14.206]  But he doesn't even want to get into that.
[02:21:14.687 --> 02:21:15.327]  And that's fine.
[02:21:15.367 --> 02:21:17.748]  He wants to get into the college conspiracy, and this is an example of this.
[02:21:17.768 --> 02:21:24.510]  But I want to get into InfowarsYes.com because, you know, I don't do... It's all about the products.
[02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:26.870]  It's not about the home business and all that.
[02:21:27.251 --> 02:21:33.373]  But the last time I did this with another company that's got some really great products, their company grew seven-fold the next three years.
[02:21:33.413 --> 02:21:34.073]  They admitted it was me.
[02:21:35.206 --> 02:21:41.812]  So I just want the listeners to know, obviously, this is something good to get in on the ground level of InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:21:42.352 --> 02:21:44.454]  Just like I told you, Trump was good to get into the beginning of it.
[02:21:44.474 --> 02:21:46.676]  And they're also not wimps to be sponsors and support us.
[02:21:47.056 --> 02:21:47.696]  So we like that.
[02:21:47.756 --> 02:21:49.498]  But I already heard about them for years.
[02:21:50.559 --> 02:21:52.700]  And then we were doing a lot of stuff in Europe.
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:56.924]  That's where they're in the top three companies in England and Germany and places.
[02:21:57.304 --> 02:22:00.246]  So that's perfect for our European invasion we're about to launch.
[02:22:00.647 --> 02:22:01.828]  I mean, you'll never know we launched it.
[02:22:02.944 --> 02:22:04.285]  I mean, the enemy listens to my phones.
[02:22:04.305 --> 02:22:04.965]  They know what we're doing.
[02:22:04.985 --> 02:22:06.745]  But let's just leave it at that.
[02:22:06.765 --> 02:22:07.906]  The European invasion will begin.
[02:22:07.926 --> 02:22:11.427]  Get the British invasion with the Beatles and stuff.
[02:22:11.687 --> 02:22:13.908]  We'll get ready for the American invasion with the Infowar.
[02:22:14.188 --> 02:22:15.229]  And I'm just going to stop right there.
[02:22:15.249 --> 02:22:16.289]  We've got world leaders involved.
[02:22:16.329 --> 02:22:16.869]  Just enjoy it.
[02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:19.971]  Give the listeners real breadcrumbs.
[02:22:20.251 --> 02:22:21.611]  As one of us goes, we all go.
[02:22:22.412 --> 02:22:25.073]  But Conrad Padilla, thank you for joining us.
[02:22:25.093 --> 02:22:26.313]  You've got the floor for the rest of the hour.
[02:22:26.633 --> 02:22:28.174]  Get into the college conspiracy.
[02:22:29.134 --> 02:22:38.060]  And I guess the colleges give you brainwashing and SJW because they want you to be all butthurt and crazy and a political operative because your degree is going to be worthless.
[02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:38.460]  Right.
[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:49.307]  Well, our whole system, Alex, teaches go to school, get your higher education, and somehow you're going to go out there and get this job that's going to pay you a whole bunch of money.
[02:22:49.327 --> 02:22:54.350]  Well, what's happening right now is you've got kids right now who have master's degree that are working at Starbucks.
[02:22:54.850 --> 02:23:00.135]  And they're working in a bunch of different places like that and they can't find the jobs that are out there because everybody's doing the same thing.
[02:23:00.155 --> 02:23:03.699]  And even the Huffington Post admission should be abolished.
[02:23:03.799 --> 02:23:05.621]  At 90% you never get your money back.
[02:23:06.089 --> 02:23:06.409]  That's right.
[02:23:06.649 --> 02:23:10.832]  Well, the biggest problem we have right now is people don't realize the debt that's being accumulated by our government.
[02:23:11.453 --> 02:23:16.776]  The college debt that's happening right now that, in most cases, doesn't even have to be paid back.
[02:23:16.816 --> 02:23:18.077]  Well, somebody's going to have to pay it back.
[02:23:18.537 --> 02:23:28.164]  So our system is teaching, go to school, get a higher education, get a bunch of debt, and then, by the way, you can't buy a house and it's going to affect the way that you can actually, you know, effectively run in your life.
[02:23:28.184 --> 02:23:29.825]  So they're literally putting a ball and chain on them.
[02:23:30.205 --> 02:23:30.545]  Well, they are.
[02:23:30.585 --> 02:23:31.566]  It's indentured servitude.
[02:23:31.766 --> 02:23:32.426]  Right, right.
[02:23:32.446 --> 02:23:37.368]  And I think that's what the whole point is, is that our system's not teaching one of the most important things, which is entrepreneurship.
[02:23:38.109 --> 02:23:43.971]  You know, I look at entrepreneurship as, you know, some people have an issue with Trump being in the office.
[02:23:44.431 --> 02:23:45.692]  Well, Trump's an entrepreneur.
[02:23:46.392 --> 02:23:52.255]  And I think the key to Trump is that if you think about it, he's doing things in there as a business guy.
[02:23:53.015 --> 02:24:01.080]  Entrepreneurship, and I think that's why so many... Yeah, he's not doing it for the bureaucracy to get more victims in college, more people on welfare, more people on the plantation.
[02:24:01.381 --> 02:24:03.762]  He's blowing off the doors of the slave plantation.
[02:24:03.782 --> 02:24:04.403]  Right, well he is.
[02:24:04.723 --> 02:24:13.669]  And that's why the professors, what's happening to the professors right now is that, we hear about it all the time with these professors, they're trying to program our kids and, you know, trump this and trump that.
[02:24:13.689 --> 02:24:17.551]  And the reality is, is that the reason they're saying that is because it goes against what they're about.
[02:24:18.252 --> 02:24:19.813]  They're not about entrepreneurship.
[02:24:20.513 --> 02:24:21.594]  They're not about individualism.
[02:24:22.912 --> 02:24:24.553]  They're about handicapped people they control.
[02:24:24.713 --> 02:24:25.113]  Well, they are.
[02:24:25.254 --> 02:24:33.359]  And so what's happening is they're teaching socialism, but the problem is that when these kids get out there and they realize that socialism means high taxes, guess what happens?
[02:24:33.379 --> 02:24:39.623]  They're going to start realizing maybe that whole socialism thing doesn't work like when I was being taught when I was in college.
[02:24:40.435 --> 02:24:41.375]  Well, that's one of two things.
[02:24:41.395 --> 02:24:48.617]  Either they wake up and realize it's a scam, or they get pissed and go, I want a pure socialist system, make it all free, make it Venezuela.
[02:24:48.637 --> 02:24:49.897]  You go, hey, that doesn't work.
[02:24:49.937 --> 02:24:51.477]  They go, I don't care, I'm going to kill you!
[02:24:51.557 --> 02:24:52.358]  Right.
[02:24:52.618 --> 02:24:56.258]  So my background, I spent 14 years on Wall Street.
[02:24:56.759 --> 02:24:58.619]  I did the higher education and did everything there.
[02:24:58.679 --> 02:25:02.960]  But what I found, though, was that I was really time poor.
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:12.747]  And what I really found is that really what was happening with Wall Street is the lawyers and everybody else that was on there, they were really the ones that were controlling everything.
[02:25:13.268 --> 02:25:16.270]  So what I started realizing was this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life.
[02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:20.653]  So this profession came around, you know, network marketing, MLM.
[02:25:20.693 --> 02:25:25.917]  As you know, sometimes people have a stigma of it, but the reality is most people don't really actually know that it's been around for over 100 years.
[02:25:27.708 --> 02:25:37.455]  And what a lot of people don't actually realize is that this profession is so proven around the world that's helped millions of people out the world be able to go into entrepreneurship.
[02:25:38.035 --> 02:25:39.656]  Well, mainstream media demonizes it.
[02:25:39.717 --> 02:25:41.098]  There's some good companies, some bad.
[02:25:41.538 --> 02:25:43.799]  But it's a model built around good products.
[02:25:43.819 --> 02:25:45.381]  That's why I've been offered hundreds of these deals.
[02:25:45.401 --> 02:25:46.061]  I've only done two.
[02:25:46.581 --> 02:25:52.446]  When it's a great product line, when it's already been successful, and then it just gives people a position to get other folks
[02:25:53.226 --> 02:25:54.086]  Well, they are.
[02:25:54.147 --> 02:25:58.529]  See, the reason that I was, when I became an independent distributor for Geness,
[02:26:10.635 --> 02:26:18.021]  The biggest thing that I liked about the company is that the owners of the company were successful business people before Janess.
[02:26:18.221 --> 02:26:19.402]  They were really successful people.
[02:26:19.702 --> 02:26:24.346]  They brought that stuff into the company, and now they're one of the powerhouses worldwide.
[02:26:24.886 --> 02:26:29.450]  But what's great about, I think, with respect to this- By the way, we had a bunch of that stuff in here.
[02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:31.492]  You guys bring the Janess stuff back in here.
[02:26:31.812 --> 02:26:35.575]  And the skin cream, I already had family people that were already using it years ago.
[02:26:35.595 --> 02:26:36.716]  It's like, oh, you're with Janess?
[02:26:36.776 --> 02:26:38.117]  I mean, this is a big, big product line.
[02:26:38.277 --> 02:26:43.842]  Yeah, so when you look at all the products that they created, they're all designed to take care of the inside and take care of the outside.
[02:26:43.882 --> 02:26:47.625]  I mean, you know, let's think about this for a second, okay?
[02:26:47.765 --> 02:26:49.226]  Who wants bags underneath their eyes?
[02:26:49.286 --> 02:26:49.627]  Nobody.
[02:26:50.107 --> 02:26:51.989]  Okay, so that product right there... I should use it.
[02:26:52.049 --> 02:26:54.691]  Yeah, that product right there, it's been on, you know... Angelus.
[02:26:55.111 --> 02:26:57.133]  It's been on a lot of different shows, things like that.
[02:26:57.153 --> 02:27:01.257]  It works in a couple of minutes, you know, you get, literally, you see the bags go away underneath your eyes.
[02:27:01.317 --> 02:27:03.539]  In fact, I can use some today, actually, myself.
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:08.746]  But the thing is, is that with all the products, they're all taking care of the inside, they're all taking care of the outside.
[02:27:08.766 --> 02:27:13.993]  So it's not, these are not products that, you know, people are, when they run out, they're going to order more, you know.
[02:27:14.033 --> 02:27:18.378]  And that's one of the best things about the business is that, you know, when people are out, they order more.
[02:27:18.519 --> 02:27:20.381]  And the cool part is that we're in 141 countries.
[02:27:22.185 --> 02:27:32.193]  So if you look at a lot of these companies that are out there and billionaires that are out there, not one of them actually looks to have a business that's just going to be focused on one particular country.
[02:27:32.733 --> 02:27:33.874]  Billionaires think worldwide.
[02:27:34.375 --> 02:27:37.197]  So it's great about the... And let me interrupt you and expand on that.
[02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:42.053]  You've got to have an amazing product because you want people to reorder.
[02:27:42.113 --> 02:27:42.793]  It's a win-win.
[02:27:43.053 --> 02:27:43.354]  Right.
[02:27:43.374 --> 02:27:44.955]  It's a 360 non-zero-sum game.
[02:27:44.975 --> 02:27:45.335]  Right.
[02:27:45.395 --> 02:27:49.978]  And you guys are already number one to number five in hundreds of... And I asked, why aren't you in the U.S.
[02:27:49.998 --> 02:27:50.159]  yet?
[02:27:50.239 --> 02:27:53.101]  And he said, well, we're tailored towards really sophisticated audiences.
[02:27:53.301 --> 02:27:53.481]  Yeah.
[02:27:53.521 --> 02:27:54.181]  Which is true.
[02:27:54.822 --> 02:27:56.663]  And so you went into Europe and Asia first.
[02:27:56.823 --> 02:27:58.645]  Now, that's why it's ground level.
[02:27:58.705 --> 02:28:00.746]  You guys are now, even though you're a U.S.
[02:28:00.786 --> 02:28:02.768]  company, you're now coming to the U.S.
[02:28:02.828 --> 02:28:03.028]  last.
[02:28:03.228 --> 02:28:03.448]  Right.
[02:28:03.829 --> 02:28:07.232]  So the company primarily started in Asia, okay?
[02:28:07.252 --> 02:28:11.295]  So when the founders of the company started, they wanted to actually start the company in Asia.
[02:28:11.795 --> 02:28:12.796]  Now they're dominating.
[02:28:12.816 --> 02:28:15.439]  I mean, their company is doing billions.
[02:28:15.459 --> 02:28:16.940]  They've done billions of dollars in sales.
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:21.204]  I mean, I think they did 1.4 billion last year and maybe more this year.
[02:28:21.224 --> 02:28:25.728]  But the thing about it, though... It's like the number one company of, quote, MLM.
[02:28:25.748 --> 02:28:27.429]  It's really about the product in some countries.
[02:28:27.509 --> 02:28:28.570]  Yeah, it is.
[02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:36.997]  Well, right now, they're actually, for momentum right now worldwide, they're passing a lot of companies that are out there right now, by far worldwide.
[02:28:37.017 --> 02:28:43.222]  But what they started in Asia, but what's happening here in the States right now is they're just on the verge of really opening up these markets here.
[02:28:43.663 --> 02:28:45.845]  And that's why I'm telling listeners, get the products, try them.
[02:28:45.965 --> 02:28:47.286]  Once you love them, which I know you will,
[02:28:48.988 --> 02:28:52.916]  Then you can become a distributor, get discounts, and make money and fund yourself.
[02:28:53.336 --> 02:28:55.360]  Yeah, this is a lot better than a worthless college degree.
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.943]  Infowarsyes.com.
[02:28:57.284 --> 02:28:57.725]  Check it out.
[02:28:57.865 --> 02:28:59.628]  We'll be back with more on the college conspiracy.
[02:29:03.399 --> 02:29:08.324]  SurvivalSylladex2, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:29:08.484 --> 02:29:16.552]  But this is the pure 999999999 stuff, 4.9 stars on Power Reviews, 6,000 plus reviews, 98% reviews.
[02:29:16.592 --> 02:29:17.633]  It's an amazing product.
[02:29:17.833 --> 02:29:19.455]  We had a really good seaweed source.
[02:29:19.475 --> 02:29:24.040]  It was one of the top rated in the world five years ago, and the globalists doing economic sabotage.
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:26.641]  Reached out, found out where we're getting it, and blocked it.
[02:29:26.721 --> 02:29:33.663]  So then we found a source, working with a big top US lab that doesn't want to be named because they get harassed, to get it from oil companies where it's 9999999 pure.
[02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:36.364]  You gotta have a DEA license to get it.
[02:29:36.384 --> 02:29:37.985]  You know, once it's put in the palm oil, it isn't.
[02:29:38.005 --> 02:29:38.765]  It's all patented.
[02:29:38.845 --> 02:29:43.607]  This has been our best seller, but the oil companies then figured out what was going on, so they doubled, they tripled prices.
[02:29:43.727 --> 02:29:44.608]  I'm not gonna sell this for $50.
[02:29:45.848 --> 02:29:47.670]  I'm not gonna pay twenty-something dollars for it.
[02:29:48.191 --> 02:29:49.893]  You know, I'm not gonna sit there and do that.
[02:29:50.013 --> 02:29:55.100]  So, I did a huge order at the old price, and then they still raised it, so I broke my contract.
[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:55.760]  I said, that's it.
[02:29:55.901 --> 02:29:56.481]  No more X2.
[02:29:56.541 --> 02:29:58.444]  And this is the best, purest iodine out there.
[02:29:58.544 --> 02:29:59.825]  Everybody sees the difference.
[02:29:59.845 --> 02:30:01.047]  The others are bound to stuff.
[02:30:01.207 --> 02:30:01.968]  I wish there was other ones.
[02:30:02.028 --> 02:30:04.971]  We're working right now with some other petroleum exploring companies.
[02:30:05.071 --> 02:30:05.952]  We're trying to have a new X2.
[02:30:06.012 --> 02:30:07.213]  This, we'll call it X3.
[02:30:07.793 --> 02:30:10.636]  And we may be close, but this is the last run of X2.
[02:30:10.676 --> 02:30:12.237]  So I've broken the contract.
[02:30:12.398 --> 02:30:12.918]  This is it.
[02:30:13.379 --> 02:30:14.740]  X2, it's amazing.
[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:16.261]  This stuff changed my life.
[02:30:16.281 --> 02:30:19.424]  Now, talk to your physician, because if you've already got preexisting issues, who knows?
[02:30:19.524 --> 02:30:21.446]  But iodine is life-giving.
[02:30:21.486 --> 02:30:22.667]  This is the end of X2.
[02:30:22.787 --> 02:30:24.569]  And I hope and pray to God we get something better.
[02:30:24.589 --> 02:30:26.130]  People say, well, why are you 25% off?
[02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:27.912]  I always discount products.
[02:30:28.072 --> 02:30:30.153]  We normally discount at 25%, okay?
[02:30:30.293 --> 02:30:33.794]  And so, until we get down to a few thousand bottles, it's gonna be there.
[02:30:33.854 --> 02:30:36.375]  And then it's gonna go to the full price in the last few thousand bottles.
[02:30:36.435 --> 02:30:38.336]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:38.616 --> 02:30:39.976]  And then you know you're getting a great product.
[02:30:40.056 --> 02:30:40.596]  Just experience.
[02:30:40.616 --> 02:30:41.257]  It takes a few weeks.
[02:30:41.297 --> 02:30:46.439]  Now, when I first started taking it five years ago, before we even sold it, when they had patents, it was the newest thing.
[02:30:46.879 --> 02:30:47.699]  Folks said, I don't know, about
[02:30:47.739 --> 02:30:50.580]  Two, three weeks in, you're gonna feel really toxic and bad.
[02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:52.221]  And stuff's gonna come out of your skin.
[02:30:52.241 --> 02:30:52.922]  It all happened.
[02:30:53.042 --> 02:30:54.582]  But it was disgusting.
[02:30:54.702 --> 02:30:56.403]  I mean, all this stuff came out of my skin.
[02:30:56.563 --> 02:30:59.265]  All these things happened because this is what powers the whole body.
[02:30:59.325 --> 02:31:01.226]  And this is pure, so it goes right into your blood.
[02:31:01.306 --> 02:31:04.107]  I mean, the stuff we have so pure, it turns into gas above 90 degrees.
[02:31:04.287 --> 02:31:05.908]  Right there, like, I Dream of Jeannie if you're watching.
[02:31:05.968 --> 02:31:06.568]  Purple gas.
[02:31:06.709 --> 02:31:08.870]  And that's not, again, a fiction movie.
[02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:09.650]  That's happening.
[02:31:09.690 --> 02:31:10.411]  That's how pure it is.
[02:31:10.431 --> 02:31:11.211]  Nobody else has got this.
[02:31:11.291 --> 02:31:12.512]  And this is the last.
[02:31:12.872 --> 02:31:14.033]  We may be able to get it on a source.
[02:31:14.073 --> 02:31:14.974]  We're working on it right now.
[02:31:15.314 --> 02:31:22.899]  But if you want X2, our best-selling, amazing product that blows every other so-called iodine away, it's available 25% off at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:23.059 --> 02:31:25.381]  But this is the final run of X2.
[02:31:25.421 --> 02:31:26.101]  If you want it, get it.
[02:31:26.421 --> 02:31:27.482]  And it supports a broadcast.

[02:34:20.994 --> 02:34:22.455]  Yes, I'm doing an infomercial.
[02:34:23.135 --> 02:34:24.436]  That's how we fund our operations.
[02:34:24.456 --> 02:34:26.878]  Support local stations, support their sponsors, spread the word.
[02:34:26.918 --> 02:34:27.458]  It's critical.
[02:34:28.039 --> 02:34:29.420]  They took our sponsors.
[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:34.063]  We can't even advertise on Google or on all these Criteo or other platforms.
[02:34:34.103 --> 02:34:35.283]  They're trying to destroy us.
[02:34:35.303 --> 02:34:37.345]  So we sell products directly to you.
[02:34:37.425 --> 02:34:38.165]  And then what do I do?
[02:34:38.225 --> 02:34:38.405]  I go...
[02:34:39.326 --> 02:34:40.307]  What's the highest rated?
[02:34:40.788 --> 02:34:41.989]  What's the fastest growing?
[02:34:42.690 --> 02:34:45.473]  What, when I go out and look at consumer surveys, do people love?
[02:34:45.493 --> 02:34:48.757]  Because I want to sell you something that's amazing.
[02:34:49.298 --> 02:34:49.538]  Yeah.
[02:34:49.738 --> 02:34:50.099]  Wow.
[02:34:50.299 --> 02:34:55.785]  Who thought, I mean, it's not like the China model where it breaks before you get out of the box, you know, and it is a total piece.
[02:34:55.905 --> 02:34:57.547]  Remember when Made in America meant something?
[02:34:58.468 --> 02:34:59.909]  So you have these amazing products.
[02:35:00.029 --> 02:35:02.151]  I want you to have the floor now because I'll rant and take over.
[02:35:02.191 --> 02:35:06.815]  I know you were getting into the college conspiracy and how they're trying to put you into dead-end jobs and all the rest of the stuff.
[02:35:07.355 --> 02:35:08.977]  This sells itself.
[02:35:08.997 --> 02:35:13.420]  And you guys have supplements, you have energy, but like you said, the women's products.
[02:35:14.682 --> 02:35:19.886]  You know, the people I know, folks I talk to that work for us in England, they already have Jeunesse.
[02:35:20.266 --> 02:35:22.348]  They're already into the skin cream, your energy drinks.
[02:35:22.689 --> 02:35:30.315]  So let's get into InfoWarsYes.com where you can get the latest, best discounts, you know, shopping cart system they set up, plugged right into them.
[02:35:31.156 --> 02:35:36.361]  Uh, and then that supports our broadcast and you can sign up and be distributors and be part of their U.S.
[02:35:36.441 --> 02:35:36.921]  invasion.
[02:35:37.262 --> 02:35:37.962]  This is smart.
[02:35:37.982 --> 02:35:45.169]  They started in the U.S., but they began in Asia, the big boom markets into Europe, and now the invasion of Jeunesse is beginning in the U.S.
[02:35:45.509 --> 02:35:47.351]  at Infowarsyes.com.
[02:35:47.551 --> 02:35:50.093]  I think everybody should get it on the ground floor of this.
[02:35:50.954 --> 02:35:56.896]  I've done one other company, because they had such good supplements, and they were like $12, $13 million the first year.
[02:35:57.236 --> 02:36:03.618]  When I got involved, they'd been around for 15 years when I got involved, they went something like $80 million after I'd been doing it for a couple of years.
[02:36:04.138 --> 02:36:08.460]  So, and of course, we got a tiny pittance of that to fund our operation, which is okay.
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:11.440]  The point is, is that this is a great sponsor for us.
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:12.761]  It's a great business for you.
[02:36:12.781 --> 02:36:14.341]  I have my own supplements.
[02:36:14.361 --> 02:36:15.862]  I have my own products that are excellent as well.
[02:36:16.522 --> 02:36:17.803]  And I go out and find out whatever the best is.
[02:36:17.863 --> 02:36:27.572]  Well, this is something that comes up to the InfoWarsLive standard and is a powerful ally for us, you know, to be another Hydra head.
[02:36:27.952 --> 02:36:30.254]  You know, as they attack us, we're growing another head.
[02:36:30.374 --> 02:36:30.995]  And it's Shinesse.
[02:36:31.295 --> 02:36:32.436]  It's InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:36:32.896 --> 02:36:34.658]  So, Conrad Padilla, please take over.
[02:36:35.138 --> 02:36:44.721]  Okay, so when you look at when you look at all the products Alex I mean basically you the the it's called a youth enhancement system and basically what it means is that Every product here has solutions.
[02:36:44.881 --> 02:36:57.104]  It's the solution to something so for example if you look at Pam right here this product here Okay, 70 70% of Americans have sleep issues 70% so this product actually helps with
[02:36:58.072 --> 02:36:59.093]  People who have sleep issues.
[02:36:59.153 --> 02:37:03.095]  I will tell you, this is probably my favorite product, only because it's hard for me to unwind.
[02:37:03.135 --> 02:37:04.656]  I'm one of those people that just goes, goes, goes, goes.
[02:37:04.696 --> 02:37:05.676]  Me too.
[02:37:05.776 --> 02:37:09.478]  And then, of course, the A.M., what it does is it helps you with energy, focus, clarity.
[02:37:09.538 --> 02:37:12.580]  But one of the products that you had talked about even, which is called Mind.
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:14.861]  In fact, a lot of the guys in here are using Mind.
[02:37:14.901 --> 02:37:21.765]  I mean, we live in a society right now where who doesn't have a cell phone and who's not exposed to technology on a, I mean, literally all day long.
[02:37:21.785 --> 02:37:25.907]  I mean, you know, when was the last time you were with somebody and they're looking at their phone all the time.
[02:37:25.947 --> 02:37:27.368]  I mean, we live in a society where attention to
[02:37:27.828 --> 02:37:28.149]  I don't know.
[02:37:43.848 --> 02:37:45.008]  Well, they've got studies.
[02:37:45.128 --> 02:37:47.970]  They give you so many false choices that aren't real choices.
[02:37:48.390 --> 02:37:51.111]  You can only make so many decisions in a day before you degrade.
[02:37:51.291 --> 02:37:52.331]  Any executive knows that.
[02:37:52.811 --> 02:37:59.414]  And so, just like Sean Parker of Facebook said, he goes, we give you all these fake choices that release all your dopamine that don't matter.
[02:37:59.714 --> 02:38:03.755]  We're stealing your time when you should not be making all those decisions this quick.
[02:38:04.156 --> 02:38:10.098]  So, there's too many decisions we're being given and something like this boosts the cognitive ability to make more decisions.
[02:38:10.578 --> 02:38:14.121]  Well, and then if you look at Reserve, okay, Reserve is right underneath it.
[02:38:14.141 --> 02:38:18.585]  They're actually gel packs, and what they basically are is they're super high antioxidants.
[02:38:19.105 --> 02:38:22.909]  They're gel packs, and what that does is it a combat stress.
[02:38:22.989 --> 02:38:24.150]  I mean, who's not stressed?
[02:38:24.250 --> 02:38:25.251]  It just blows you away.
[02:38:25.691 --> 02:38:26.132]  I'll say it.
[02:38:26.152 --> 02:38:27.773]  I mean, we've got Brain Force, which people love.
[02:38:27.813 --> 02:38:28.273]  It's excellent.
[02:38:28.414 --> 02:38:29.294]  I am jealous of this.
[02:38:29.835 --> 02:38:32.397]  I mean, I take mine all the time now.
[02:38:32.417 --> 02:38:33.858]  If I've got to stay up particularly late,
[02:38:34.779 --> 02:38:38.580]  Because I'm the type of person that doesn't need healthy stimulants early, it's later.
[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:40.721]  And then usually they make me kind of whacked out.
[02:38:40.961 --> 02:38:46.682]  I'm never mean to my wife unless I've had too much coffee, too much... No, but this, I'm not a jerk.
[02:38:47.302 --> 02:38:48.383]  So why is mine different?
[02:38:48.923 --> 02:38:53.024]  Well, the key to mine is obviously it's the technology and the Syracuse.
[02:38:53.664 --> 02:38:59.410]  The Syracuse basically, what it does is it really, it helps with your focus, it helps with your memory.
[02:38:59.430 --> 02:39:02.192]  You know, one of the fastest... And this has some of the same stuff that's in BrainForce.
[02:39:02.212 --> 02:39:04.374]  It's just, it's liquid and it's concentrated.
[02:39:04.394 --> 02:39:06.336]  Yeah, it goes in, so it goes in your system really quick.
[02:39:06.376 --> 02:39:15.645]  I mean, the best thing that I think anybody could really do is you go to, you know, obviously go to infowarsyes.com and when you go there, there's some really, really good videos on all of the different
[02:39:16.446 --> 02:39:26.433]  I mean, the videos are really incredible, and it really gives you a general idea as far as really what each product does, so that you can really make a decision as far as, you know, how many you want to order, things like that.
[02:39:27.033 --> 02:39:29.715]  What is the best-selling product right now in the Jeunesse Empire?
[02:39:29.936 --> 02:39:30.356]  Reserve.
[02:39:30.796 --> 02:39:32.738]  Reserve, which is the gel packs here at the bottom.
[02:39:33.258 --> 02:39:35.179]  I haven't taken Reserve.
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:36.581]  That's the problem with these great supplements.
[02:39:36.881 --> 02:39:37.701]  There's so many.
[02:39:38.042 --> 02:39:39.042]  I've taken Mine.
[02:39:39.483 --> 02:39:42.425]  Years ago, I've taken the Energy Drink, which is incredible.
[02:39:42.465 --> 02:39:43.326]  My wife drinks those.
[02:39:43.766 --> 02:39:44.687]  Those are all over the place.
[02:39:45.807 --> 02:39:48.769]  And then I did the eye cream a few times to test it and it really works.
[02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:49.850]  I need to do it every day.
[02:39:50.310 --> 02:39:51.391]  So, wow.
[02:39:51.671 --> 02:39:52.651]  What does this do then?
[02:39:53.572 --> 02:39:59.976]  So it has acai in it, it's got green tea in it, it's got, you know, a lot of basically super fruits in it.
[02:39:59.996 --> 02:40:04.678]  What it does is, you know, we all know the fruits that we get here now don't have the same punch anymore.
[02:40:04.698 --> 02:40:05.239]  No, they don't.
[02:40:05.599 --> 02:40:09.041]  So what's great about this is that a lot of these fruits aren't from around here.
[02:40:09.381 --> 02:40:11.803]  Like the acai berry comes from the Brazilian rainforest.
[02:40:11.923 --> 02:40:14.064]  So you guys are wild harvesting?
[02:40:14.284 --> 02:40:14.985]  Oh absolutely.
[02:40:15.065 --> 02:40:15.565]  Wild horse.
[02:40:15.585 --> 02:40:25.391]  Well that was the next thing when I had the doctor, one of your consultants on about this, a medical doctor, is that I'm in supplement business so I know that most places the container has more cost than what's in it.
[02:40:25.652 --> 02:40:25.812]  Yeah.
[02:40:26.092 --> 02:40:27.953]  And then I looked and I looked at the numbers.
[02:40:28.013 --> 02:40:32.876]  I had my folks check it and they're like no, this place has like a 150% markup.
[02:40:33.297 --> 02:40:34.357]  Others have a 7 times.
[02:40:34.377 --> 02:40:34.898]  That's what we do.
[02:40:34.918 --> 02:40:35.798]  150% markup.
[02:40:35.818 --> 02:40:36.499]  You gotta pay for stuff.
[02:40:37.179 --> 02:40:37.799]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:40:37.839 --> 02:40:39.080]  You guys put a lot of in.
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:44.302]  That's why I'm partnering with you is it's my philosophy is actually give a reasonable price and then load it with product.
[02:40:44.663 --> 02:40:47.804]  Why not have them have their socks knocked off?
[02:40:47.824 --> 02:40:50.745]  I mean, I don't get the supplement companies that give you crap.
[02:40:51.366 --> 02:40:53.927]  Why would you not want to blow people away?
[02:40:54.127 --> 02:41:00.793]  Well, because they're not looking for ongoing people to basically order the products ongoing.
[02:41:01.873 --> 02:41:03.895]  What's great about the Jeunesse product lines is that... Exactly.
[02:41:03.915 --> 02:41:06.837]  They want to do a big marketing campaign and get you one time.
[02:41:07.238 --> 02:41:07.658]  No, no.
[02:41:07.718 --> 02:41:08.759]  We want you forever.
[02:41:08.839 --> 02:41:09.199]  That's right.
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:09.840]  That's right.
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:15.945]  And that's why people, if you look at Jeunesse and why they're doing these billions of dollars of sales over the last few years is because people, when they're out, they reorder.
[02:41:16.125 --> 02:41:16.906]  Well, let me be honest then.
[02:41:17.286 --> 02:41:17.827]  Product control.
[02:41:18.627 --> 02:41:19.927]  I had an idea to have knockout.
[02:41:20.347 --> 02:41:24.148]  It cost the same as a melatonin dose, but add L-tryptophan and valerian, really much stuff.
[02:41:24.528 --> 02:41:25.989]  And six or seven runs were great.
[02:41:26.049 --> 02:41:26.529]  Best seller.
[02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:31.630]  The latest run is okay, but my wife about three months ago goes, I'm not sleeping as good.
[02:41:31.690 --> 02:41:32.470]  This isn't as good.
[02:41:33.370 --> 02:41:39.531]  And I'm about to change formulators and do stuff because after like four years, they, I think somebody, I'm not going to say their name, took me for granted.
[02:41:40.191 --> 02:41:41.592]  And then we got some dried herbs.
[02:41:41.772 --> 02:41:42.252]  I don't know.
[02:41:43.777 --> 02:41:46.778]  Knockout still is okay, but it ain't knockout anymore.
[02:41:47.058 --> 02:41:47.898]  So I'm going to tell the audience.
[02:41:48.818 --> 02:41:49.458]  That's what I mean.
[02:41:49.538 --> 02:41:51.759]  It's the hassle of keeping the quality up.
[02:41:51.799 --> 02:41:52.379]  How have you done that?
[02:41:52.539 --> 02:41:52.759]  Right.
[02:41:53.019 --> 02:41:56.800]  Well, first of all, they get the right doctors to put the science together to make it happen.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:57.080]  Sure.
[02:41:57.100 --> 02:42:02.761]  I was with the manufacturers, though, because we'll get a formula that's incredible, and then suddenly a year later, it's happened on a few products.
[02:42:02.821 --> 02:42:04.102]  It's like, well, this is not the same.
[02:42:04.262 --> 02:42:04.482]  Yeah.
[02:42:04.542 --> 02:42:05.702]  And then we discontinue it, folks.
[02:42:05.762 --> 02:42:07.522]  And I'm not putting down knockout.
[02:42:07.562 --> 02:42:08.703]  It still works.
[02:42:08.983 --> 02:42:09.123]  Yeah.
[02:42:11.203 --> 02:42:11.403]  Yeah.
[02:42:11.763 --> 02:42:16.365]  So when you go to Infowarsyes.com, when you go there, the interview that you did with Dr. Jan Papa is on there.
[02:42:16.465 --> 02:42:24.089]  And Dr. Jan Papa talks about a lot of the technology that's in the products with respect to it being transferred and delivered and things like that.
[02:42:24.149 --> 02:42:30.132]  So I think the key for you guys is just to understand that when you take this product, it has a lot of punch.
[02:42:30.152 --> 02:42:34.194]  And the reason it has a lot of punch is because it's not just developing the product, it's also the shipment of the products.
[02:42:34.434 --> 02:42:38.758]  Sure, and he was talking about how they also deliver it in stasis so it keeps the quality.
[02:42:39.038 --> 02:42:40.880]  By the way, I'm not a guy to put down our own products.
[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:42.261]  I can only be honest.
[02:42:42.641 --> 02:42:42.941]  Yeah.
[02:42:42.961 --> 02:42:52.509]  It's like, knockout still helps some, but it was like, we had badges before that were like, knockout, and now it's like, so, believe me, believe me, a new formulation's coming, I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.
[02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:53.770]  Nobody even complained.
[02:42:53.931 --> 02:42:54.471]  I noticed it.
[02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:56.493]  Okay, so, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:42:56.513 --> 02:42:58.014]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:42:58.374 --> 02:42:58.715]  Check it out.
[02:43:02.645 --> 02:43:04.750]  33% of the population of the U.S.
[02:43:04.971 --> 02:43:07.417]  That's 2 out of every 3 people you're looking at?
[02:43:08.408 --> 02:43:11.870]  carry staph aureus bacteria in their nose.
[02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:18.474]  Two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin-resistant staph.
[02:43:19.014 --> 02:43:24.777]  Now what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than AIDS.
[02:43:25.217 --> 02:43:33.582]  And so what we do is we work really hard, did mass amounts of research, and we found that our gel, your gel,
[02:43:34.622 --> 02:43:36.907]  As a first line of defense, it's amazing.
[02:43:36.987 --> 02:43:45.322]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that will last up to three days.
[02:43:46.076 --> 02:43:52.619]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph, E. coli, Candida, Aspergillus niger, in minutes.
[02:43:53.439 --> 02:44:10.067]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field and ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a methicillin-resistant staph bacteria, from that soccer field.
[02:44:10.787 --> 02:44:18.911]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephones, in subways.
[02:44:19.632 --> 02:44:29.837]  And this gel that you have access to is the first line of defense for everybody to be able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria.
[02:44:30.177 --> 02:44:38.001]  You gel it up and you don't worry about it because we have heal rates of about half the normal time and you actually have something now
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:42.262]  In your house, where you can easily take care of it.
[02:44:42.883 --> 02:44:45.465]  I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time.
[02:44:45.485 --> 02:44:54.311]  Because explain why the super silver wound gel dressing from Infowarslife.com that we probably labeled from your top of the line, your top selling product nationwide.
[02:44:54.631 --> 02:44:55.531]  Why is it so special?
[02:44:56.032 --> 02:45:04.738]  These studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes down 24 hours with no negative effect on any system in your body.
[02:45:05.178 --> 02:45:07.900]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[02:45:08.689 --> 02:45:09.430]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:45:09.550 --> 02:45:18.338]  Over-the-counter, which is what you have, available to your people, is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[02:45:18.578 --> 02:45:21.360]  You have one of the only products in the U.S.
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.404]  that can, like, make a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[02:45:25.844 --> 02:45:31.730]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about, probably, three or four minutes.
[02:45:32.390 --> 02:45:35.193]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[02:45:35.313 --> 02:45:39.237]  What a blessing to have something that you have in your house right now.
[02:45:39.457 --> 02:45:41.719]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this.
[02:45:41.940 --> 02:45:54.492]  So hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were caused in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[02:45:55.192 --> 02:46:00.656]  That's why they're going back to the silver products because our silver is proven to kill those.
[02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:07.581]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are Methicillin-resistant Staph and one called VRE.
[02:46:07.701 --> 02:46:12.304]  And VRE is Ventomycin-resistant Enterococcus Fecalis.
[02:46:12.505 --> 02:46:14.906]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[02:46:15.507 --> 02:46:18.409]  And so the cool part is this gel kills it in minutes.
[02:46:19.109 --> 02:46:28.558]  So you don't have to worry about your kids getting an amputation or wound or you don't have to have, you know, a funeral for somebody you love.
[02:46:28.578 --> 02:46:40.589]  And the bottom line is you guys did years and years and years and years and years and years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies and you finally found out the perfect silver, the most effective, and it's available at Infowarsstore.com and you helped save the country.
[02:46:41.049 --> 02:46:42.430]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:29.164 --> 02:47:34.547]  Alright, Conrad Padilla's here, and he's one of the top marketers, researchers out there.
[02:47:35.568 --> 02:47:37.549]  And we're getting into the college conspiracy earlier.
[02:47:37.569 --> 02:47:41.271]  I don't bring you information that I'm not hot on.
[02:47:41.831 --> 02:47:42.491]  I'm gonna say this again.
[02:47:43.632 --> 02:47:45.473]  I want to bring you winners.
[02:47:46.193 --> 02:47:47.034]  If I was a car dealer...
[02:47:47.788 --> 02:47:53.811]  I want to sell whatever the highest rated car was that was the hottest selling and worked the best so everybody would love me.
[02:47:54.251 --> 02:47:57.513]  I would not be selling, you know, Gremlins and Pacers.
[02:47:58.013 --> 02:48:05.077]  You know, I would be selling Toyotas and, you know, Fords are pretty good.
[02:48:05.757 --> 02:48:07.478]  And so that's what this comes down to.
[02:48:07.558 --> 02:48:10.679]  So, yes, I want to do this as a hard pitch.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.402]  Our listeners need to know, you guys are already one of the top companies worldwide.
[02:48:16.633 --> 02:48:18.414]  You're now doing your big push in the U.S.
[02:48:19.255 --> 02:48:22.257]  and I think people need to get fundamentally involved in this.
[02:48:22.277 --> 02:48:37.548]  You guys are so successful, and I was reading even in the different perspectives online in Wall Street, that you're doing something, because you're not an MLM company, you're a skin care product, energy company, supplement, lifestyle, highest quality, with medical doctors designing it.
[02:48:37.628 --> 02:48:44.474]  But you use MLM as the model so folks have a way to get word of mouth, the most powerful thing in the universe, especially in the censorship paradigm.
[02:48:45.074 --> 02:48:49.198]  And so you guys are set to dominate in the United States.
[02:48:49.578 --> 02:48:50.479]  I'm just telling listeners.
[02:48:51.656 --> 02:48:53.097]  I told you America was about to be great again.
[02:48:53.137 --> 02:48:54.538]  I told you Trump was about to get novice.
[02:48:54.758 --> 02:48:56.179]  I mean, that's why they hate us, folks.
[02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:03.404]  We know what's going on and people need to go to InfoWarsYes.com to be part of this, get great products, a great business model.
[02:49:04.085 --> 02:49:05.886]  You don't have to be a business person.
[02:49:06.326 --> 02:49:08.107]  You don't have to be a distributor to get the products.
[02:49:08.127 --> 02:49:09.949]  You can buy them straight up or get discounts and get them.
[02:49:10.209 --> 02:49:11.550]  But you guys have some deals.
[02:49:12.443 --> 02:49:13.384]  We're good.
[02:49:28.773 --> 02:49:32.076]  Folks, I've been offered hundreds of millions of dollars to support cryptocurrencies.
[02:49:32.717 --> 02:49:37.321]  And I get they're real and I get that they're just like the, you know, our government has a fiat currency.
[02:49:37.701 --> 02:49:45.848]  I've never taken any sponsorship from it because I can't figure it out and I can't guarantee there's not a pump and dump like you see cryptocurrencies down 80% this month.
[02:49:47.102 --> 02:49:57.049]  So I could have financed everything off of cryptocurrencies and literally defeated Soros and the Globalists, but I couldn't be sure you were going to get a good product.
[02:49:57.209 --> 02:49:58.510]  These are highest rated.
[02:49:58.930 --> 02:50:00.131]  These I know are good.
[02:50:00.471 --> 02:50:06.295]  So bare minimum, you become a distributor, you get discounts, you sign up a few family members, it pays for what you get each month.
[02:50:06.536 --> 02:50:09.277]  Maybe you sign up 100 members and you make a million dollars a year.
[02:50:09.598 --> 02:50:15.282]  The point is, is that I feel good at a gut level promoting Jeunesse at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:50:15.842 --> 02:50:27.028]  So, that's what I'm saying here is, this is a really sexy thing here that I, at a Mui Grande level, feel good pushing.
[02:50:27.228 --> 02:50:28.529]  That's why I'm thumbing at the mouth here.
[02:50:28.569 --> 02:50:33.592]  So, in the time we have in this segment and the next, get into the marketing angle, the business angle.
[02:50:33.612 --> 02:50:34.673]  The products are incredible.
[02:50:34.693 --> 02:50:35.373]  We'll get back into that.
[02:50:35.413 --> 02:50:39.015]  But why I, out of thousands of choices, have picked Jeunesse?
[02:50:39.235 --> 02:50:40.295]  Well, a couple things you said.
[02:50:40.835 --> 02:50:41.876]  Number one, cryptocurrencies.
[02:50:41.936 --> 02:50:44.156]  I mean, you look at people right now.
[02:50:44.236 --> 02:50:47.437]  People are starving to invest in something, especially millennials.
[02:50:48.397 --> 02:50:53.419]  The challenge, though, Alex, with millennials is they're afraid of Wall Street because they saw what happened to their parents.
[02:50:53.959 --> 02:50:54.959]  You know, their parents' fortunes.
[02:50:54.979 --> 02:50:55.159]  Dot com.
[02:50:55.499 --> 02:50:56.159]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:58.040]  They saw their fortune, you know, their parents' fortunes.
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:58.180]  And 2008.
[02:50:58.380 --> 02:50:59.280]  That's right, and 2008.
[02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:04.521]  So what's happening right now is they're very leery, but they also understand, though, that they have to do something for their future.
[02:51:04.581 --> 02:51:06.942]  What I love about this model, though, is that
[02:51:07.702 --> 02:51:12.163]  You know, who has six to seven figures to go risk in a traditional franchise?
[02:51:12.503 --> 02:51:14.364]  Franchise has been around since the 1950s.
[02:51:15.124 --> 02:51:20.065]  I couldn't go invest in a P. Terry's hamburger place.
[02:51:20.085 --> 02:51:20.925]  I don't have the money to do that.
[02:51:20.945 --> 02:51:21.786]  It's like five million dollars.
[02:51:21.966 --> 02:51:29.108]  Yeah, so what's great about this model though is it gives the average person a shot and that's why I think it's such an emerging and fast-growing industry.
[02:51:30.988 --> 02:51:33.289]  Skin cream, you guys, that's the thing.
[02:51:33.369 --> 02:51:34.310]  I looked at the products.
[02:51:34.330 --> 02:51:36.051]  I already heard the buzz before I ever heard from you guys.
[02:51:36.131 --> 02:51:36.351]  Yeah.
[02:51:36.371 --> 02:51:37.191]  George Dorey's involved.
[02:51:37.231 --> 02:51:38.132]  He's like telling me years ago.
[02:51:38.152 --> 02:51:39.333]  Jennette's like, I've heard of that.
[02:51:39.393 --> 02:51:40.133]  My mom has it.
[02:51:40.673 --> 02:51:41.834]  My girlfriend, my wife.
[02:51:41.954 --> 02:51:43.615]  I already had the buzz.
[02:51:43.935 --> 02:51:45.356]  And then I looked at the products.
[02:51:45.556 --> 02:51:45.776]  Yeah.
[02:51:46.076 --> 02:51:52.400]  So the thing about the products, what's great about it though, is even if the economy slows, I've never met a person that says, I'm not going to take care of myself.
[02:51:53.220 --> 02:51:53.400]  Right?
[02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:56.603]  I mean, nobody's going to say, hey, you know, there's another wrinkle.
[02:51:56.643 --> 02:51:57.684]  Hey, there's more gray hairs.
[02:51:57.945 --> 02:51:59.766]  We're in a recession, so I'm not going to take care of myself.
[02:51:59.867 --> 02:52:07.314]  I mean, these products are going to do well, you know, because people use, when they're out, they reorder the product and regardless of the environment.
[02:52:07.334 --> 02:52:09.736]  So as a... You have a 50% reorder rate.
[02:52:09.856 --> 02:52:11.338]  No other company has that.
[02:52:11.758 --> 02:52:20.587]  Yeah, most of these products, you know, some of them, like the serum, this serum here, it has over an 80% reorder rate.
[02:52:20.868 --> 02:52:26.293]  Believe me, when I, George Norton told me this two years ago, and wait a minute, I've seen this in my wife's bathroom.
[02:52:26.394 --> 02:52:26.574]  Yeah.
[02:52:27.523 --> 02:52:31.525]  Like I'm over there, you know, kissing on the neck and stuff and I'm like looking down at this at her counter.
[02:52:31.785 --> 02:52:32.005]  Yeah.
[02:52:32.146 --> 02:52:32.326]  Yeah.
[02:52:32.386 --> 02:52:36.168]  And that's and that's the key is that when when people are out, they reorder the products.
[02:52:36.188 --> 02:52:44.212]  But once again, if you're going to look at a business, you've got to be you've got to have a business that will do well regardless of what the environment looks like.
[02:52:44.632 --> 02:52:48.375]  People have to remember that most successful business people out there don't have one
[02:52:49.475 --> 02:52:49.835]  Revenue
[02:53:05.823 --> 02:53:07.704]  Cosmetics and high-rated supplements.
[02:53:08.345 --> 02:53:14.348]  You should get this to support InfoWars and see how great they are and just buy it once and then they're gonna be hooked because it's so good.
[02:53:14.668 --> 02:53:22.031]  Now you're making money, the show's making money, we're defeating the globalists, they're getting good products, and then you go, oh, become a distributor under me.
[02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:26.453]  Well think about it, how many of us right now, you know, like there's a new Apple phone coming out, right?
[02:53:26.493 --> 02:53:27.694]  There's a new Apple phone coming out.
[02:53:28.014 --> 02:53:29.675]  And plus some 50 bucks to make, it'll be
[02:53:30.055 --> 02:53:30.516]  $1,400?
[02:53:30.175 --> 02:53:30.516]  Yeah.
[02:53:30.616 --> 02:53:34.461]  Okay, so people are going to go out and say, hey, look at my new phone.
[02:53:34.501 --> 02:53:35.643]  How much are you getting paid from Apple?
[02:53:36.083 --> 02:53:39.989]  You know, we live in a society where people are constantly... Yeah, tell folks about the new deal.
[02:53:40.690 --> 02:53:47.198]  So right now, what they have going right now is if you become a preferred customer, you can get up to 25% off the products, right?
[02:53:47.819 --> 02:53:50.882]  You get 25% off of the products if you become a Preferred Customer.
[02:53:51.322 --> 02:53:58.949]  If you want to get up to 40% off, then you pay a one-time membership fee, which is $49.95 or something like that.
[02:53:59.309 --> 02:54:02.252]  And you can get all the products for up to 40% off.
[02:54:02.312 --> 02:54:03.874]  And that's like Costco.
[02:54:03.914 --> 02:54:05.235]  You save the money one time.
[02:54:05.475 --> 02:54:06.355]  That's right, that's right.
[02:54:06.435 --> 02:54:09.316]  But what's great about this is you pay at Costco, you gotta pay every year.
[02:54:09.896 --> 02:54:10.937]  This is one time.
[02:54:11.037 --> 02:54:11.917]  You pay this one time.
[02:54:12.117 --> 02:54:13.457]  Same thing with Sam's, right?
[02:54:13.557 --> 02:54:14.418]  It's every year.
[02:54:14.438 --> 02:54:15.458]  Yeah, you pay it every year.
[02:54:15.518 --> 02:54:20.279]  So most people that are out there, they want the most discount, which is 40% off of these products.
[02:54:20.399 --> 02:54:23.640]  And again, Walmart does that because they want your commitment.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:24.900]  They're going to give you the best deal.
[02:54:25.281 --> 02:54:26.901]  They want you to put the ring on.
[02:54:26.941 --> 02:54:27.681]  They want the commitment.
[02:54:27.721 --> 02:54:28.982]  Well, I want your commitment.
[02:54:29.302 --> 02:54:30.902]  I want to defeat Soros.
[02:54:31.382 --> 02:54:32.623]  My God, these are great products.
[02:54:32.643 --> 02:54:33.363]  They're the best out there.
[02:54:33.863 --> 02:54:34.243]  Keep going.
[02:54:34.263 --> 02:54:34.783]  Yeah.
[02:54:35.164 --> 02:54:43.127]  So if you look at the products, for example, with all of them, every single product on average that you're going to be able to use here, some of them work right away.
[02:54:43.187 --> 02:54:48.270]  Like if you look at Instantly Ages for bags underneath the eyes, who in the world wants bags under the eyes, male or female?
[02:54:48.310 --> 02:54:49.871]  I mean, this works within a couple of minutes.
[02:54:50.851 --> 02:54:53.632]  In fact, we're going to get Alex, I think, to do it.
[02:54:53.712 --> 02:54:54.612]  I've just been too busy.
[02:54:54.652 --> 02:54:55.092]  No, here's the thing.
[02:54:55.392 --> 02:54:56.293]  I know all this stuff works.
[02:54:56.333 --> 02:54:56.813]  I've tried it.
[02:54:56.973 --> 02:54:58.873]  I just need to do it.
[02:54:58.893 --> 02:55:02.174]  Yeah, and you literally see this work in a couple of minutes.
[02:55:02.194 --> 02:55:06.636]  When you go to Infowarsyes.com, once again, look at the videos that are on there.
[02:55:06.676 --> 02:55:09.837]  You're actually going to see the products and how fast some of these products work.
[02:55:09.917 --> 02:55:11.597]  Like, for example, the Instantly Ageless.
[02:55:12.017 --> 02:55:17.159]  Two minutes, you see the bags actually go away for up to six to eight hours, somewhere in that ballpark.
[02:55:17.199 --> 02:55:19.540]  But, I mean, who wants bags, right?
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:20.480]  So, if you look at
[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:22.802]  Every single product in here, once again, they have purpose.
[02:55:22.842 --> 02:55:23.943]  Same thing with the energy drinks.
[02:55:24.003 --> 02:55:25.704]  I mean, who has energy challenges?
[02:55:26.084 --> 02:55:27.605]  Tell people, because I've seen these for years.
[02:55:27.665 --> 02:55:28.406]  Everybody's got these.
[02:55:28.626 --> 02:55:29.166]  Tell me about these.
[02:55:29.467 --> 02:55:29.907]  It's simple.
[02:55:29.947 --> 02:55:30.707]  They give you energy.
[02:55:30.747 --> 02:55:33.710]  You know, if energy challenges... And tell folks the name of it and about it.
[02:55:33.770 --> 02:55:35.771]  So Nevo, there's different flavors.
[02:55:35.811 --> 02:55:38.994]  There's obviously, you know, acai grape, peach mango, lemon ginger.
[02:55:39.014 --> 02:55:42.256]  I drink, you know, one to two a day myself.
[02:55:42.316 --> 02:55:44.798]  I mean, who doesn't have energy challenges, right?
[02:55:44.918 --> 02:55:47.860]  But what I like about these is it doesn't make me feel crazy when I take them.
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:48.340]  Correct.
[02:55:49.301 --> 02:55:53.223]  Yeah, it does make you feel like an out-of-body experience, like you're taking some of these traditional energy drinks.
[02:55:53.403 --> 02:56:05.250]  My thing is, if I've got to, like, do... I'll work 18 hours, and my wife is like, you're so sweet, baby, but if you show up at 9 at night, you're just depressed, and you're rude, and you just go sit in a chair and look at a computer.
[02:56:05.730 --> 02:56:08.452]  But if I take things like this product, I'm not.
[02:56:09.032 --> 02:56:09.853]  Well, that's the key.
[02:56:11.093 --> 02:56:15.896]  The thing about this product is that when you drink the product, you're going to notice that you have more energy.
[02:56:15.916 --> 02:56:24.022]  I mean, you have to look at the fact that we live in a society where people are sleeping less and working more and stressed out.
[02:56:24.062 --> 02:56:24.882]  I mean, that's the truth.
[02:56:24.942 --> 02:56:30.185]  And so, these are solutions for you, once again, like all the products, to be able to have more energy.
[02:56:30.265 --> 02:56:31.546]  And this is a worldwide problem.
[02:56:31.566 --> 02:56:35.889]  What I love about Jeunesse, once again, they're in 141 countries and growing, and it's a worldwide problem.
[02:56:36.449 --> 02:56:39.071]  And you've got medical doctors that are developing this.
[02:56:39.352 --> 02:56:47.938]  Yeah, so the guys who actually develop these products, these are not just, you know, what Janess didn't want to do is just get some MDs just to say, hey we got MDs.
[02:56:48.559 --> 02:56:50.801]  You don't have guys walking around in white lab coats.
[02:56:51.221 --> 02:56:52.141]  No, no, no.
[02:56:52.621 --> 02:56:53.862]  The guys weren't in the commercial.
[02:56:54.182 --> 02:56:55.062]  They were in the development.
[02:56:55.182 --> 02:56:55.402]  Right.
[02:56:55.602 --> 02:56:56.482]  They were in the development.
[02:56:57.043 --> 02:57:00.443]  You guys had Dr. Jan Popp on there.
[02:57:00.503 --> 02:57:01.444]  Research this guy.
[02:57:01.484 --> 02:57:02.864]  Look who these people are.
[02:57:02.904 --> 02:57:06.105]  These are some of the most elite doctors in not just the U.S.
[02:57:06.165 --> 02:57:09.606]  And he's taking the precursors for your body to produce stem cells.
[02:57:09.766 --> 02:57:10.066]  Correct.
[02:57:10.106 --> 02:57:11.106]  He's giving you the fuel.
[02:57:11.566 --> 02:57:11.786]  Right.
[02:57:12.006 --> 02:57:13.507]  So it's one thing for somebody to inject, you know,
[02:57:15.328 --> 02:57:19.170]  $500 a shot growth hormone, why not give your body the precursor to naturally do it?
[02:57:19.411 --> 02:57:19.631]  Right.
[02:57:19.771 --> 02:57:20.872]  That way you don't get the cancer.
[02:57:21.032 --> 02:57:21.732]  Right, exactly.
[02:57:22.213 --> 02:57:23.654]  Well, the key is prevention.
[02:57:23.734 --> 02:57:28.777]  The key is to do things before, you know, if you give your body some good things, you can help your body fight off disease.
[02:57:28.797 --> 02:57:29.297]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:57:29.317 --> 02:57:32.179]  If you take the steroid or whatever, that kills your acid.
[02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:36.983]  Why not just give your body what it needs, like a plant, like sunlight, water, and the nutrients.
[02:57:37.463 --> 02:57:38.564]  I'm very, very excited.
[02:57:38.584 --> 02:57:40.765]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:40.805 --> 02:57:42.146]  Banners on InfoWars.com.
[02:57:42.546 --> 02:57:44.347]  We've got Anthony Comey and Lothar Verbeer coming up.
[02:57:44.367 --> 02:57:46.969]  We'll do five more minutes with Conrad Padilla.
[02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:47.449]  Straight ahead.
[02:57:47.469 --> 02:57:52.132]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.312 --> 02:57:53.553]  You are confident.
[02:57:53.633 --> 02:57:54.153]  You are unique.
[02:57:54.193 --> 02:57:54.934]  You are inspiring.
[02:58:07.458 --> 02:58:10.120]  And today, you will look your beautiful best.
[02:58:12.662 --> 02:58:13.662]  Instantly ageless.
[02:58:14.243 --> 02:58:19.887]  An age-defying microcream that in less than two minutes restores the youthful appearance of your skin.
[02:58:21.368 --> 02:58:27.072]  Created to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, pores, and puffiness under the eyes.
[02:58:28.212 --> 02:58:28.953]  No needles.
[02:58:29.593 --> 02:58:30.114]  No pain.
[02:58:30.934 --> 02:58:33.116]  Just a happier, younger-looking you.
[02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:36.394]  To use, simply massage the packet.
[02:58:37.376 --> 02:58:40.864]  Dispense a small drop and lightly pat a thin layer to targeted areas.
[02:58:41.923 --> 02:58:46.205]  Leave the product damp on your skin and remain expressionless for two minutes while it dries.
[02:58:46.985 --> 02:58:49.446]  And, if you missed a spot, it's easy to reapply.
[02:58:49.967 --> 02:58:54.348]  Or, if you happen to apply too much, wet a cotton swab and gently remove any residue.
[02:58:55.009 --> 02:58:58.110]  Apply oil-free cosmetics and finish getting ready as usual.
[02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:59.391]  It's that simple!
[02:58:59.851 --> 02:59:08.855]  I've probably noticed in the past five years that my eyes have gained a lot of fine lines, wrinkles, my curls have gotten deeper.
[02:59:12.432 --> 02:59:12.712]  Wow.
[02:59:12.892 --> 02:59:15.894]  I was hoping for five years, but that's like what my eyes looked like ten years ago.
[02:59:16.975 --> 02:59:18.636]  That is really cool!
[02:59:19.517 --> 02:59:19.897]  Wrinkle?
[02:59:20.518 --> 02:59:20.838]  Gone?
[02:59:22.279 --> 02:59:22.659]  It's easy.
[02:59:22.679 --> 02:59:24.460]  You just put it on your finger and go.
[02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:27.002]  I wish I had more down here because I can still see one wrinkle.
[02:59:27.042 --> 02:59:27.622]  It's bugging me.
[02:59:28.603 --> 02:59:29.844]  I am a little bit emotional.
[02:59:30.424 --> 02:59:41.192]  Turning 40, I didn't think would be a big deal to me, but that looks like the me that I feel like inside instead of what I see when I look in the mirror.
[02:59:53.843 --> 02:59:57.944]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:58.484 --> 02:59:59.804]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.666 --> 03:00:10.867]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:00:11.207 --> 03:00:13.667]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:13.988 --> 03:00:16.328]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.888 --> 03:00:19.589]  My love is at lead for the freeway.
[03:00:24.551 --> 03:00:32.014]  Conrad Padilla is our guest, and listen, I'm just trying to promote stuff that funds us and funds you and works really great.
[03:00:32.795 --> 03:00:36.597]  And I don't do infomercials a lot, and he didn't want to come in and do this.
[03:00:36.617 --> 03:00:37.737]  He's like, you're gonna put products up there?
[03:00:37.757 --> 03:00:40.318]  I want to talk about college and alternative businesses.
[03:00:40.338 --> 03:00:41.599]  But yeah, no, I'm proud of this, man.
[03:00:41.979 --> 03:00:42.859]  This helps people.
[03:00:42.899 --> 03:00:43.660]  This empowers them.
[03:00:43.700 --> 03:00:46.001]  And all the products that I've used are great.
[03:00:46.121 --> 03:00:48.162]  The reviews are amazing.
[03:00:48.362 --> 03:00:52.344]  I mean, to quote Robert Duvall and Network, this is a big you-know-what hit.
[03:00:53.623 --> 03:00:56.305]  Let's just say a big mammary gland hit here.
[03:00:56.845 --> 03:01:02.028]  So I'm just telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that you want to get it on the ground floor of m4syes.com.
[03:01:02.569 --> 03:01:05.110]  You can go to Jeunesse and all other sites that have it, and that's great.
[03:01:05.450 --> 03:01:08.732]  The big thing is go to m4syes.com and get the best deals, and it funds our operation.
[03:01:09.453 --> 03:01:12.575]  And quantify, though, because you were talking about this new deal.
[03:01:13.015 --> 03:01:15.997]  How do people qualify to then have you guys with matching funds?
[03:01:16.437 --> 03:01:16.677]  Yeah.
[03:01:17.718 --> 03:01:26.402]  So one of the things about this company is that they really do get involved with helping the independent distributors with, you know, getting their businesses going and things like that.
[03:01:26.982 --> 03:01:37.568]  What's great about the company, though, is whatever help that you need in your area or whatever help that you need in the particular country that you're in, they're going to partner with you and strategize with you, along, of course, with my team.
[03:01:37.608 --> 03:01:40.969]  Oh, that's the other good news, because it always kills people to get shipping from the U.S.
[03:01:41.009 --> 03:01:41.470]  You guys
[03:01:43.371 --> 03:01:55.758]  Yeah, so basically what's great about it is if you're looking for a business, once again, the company does everything for you.
[03:01:55.798 --> 03:01:57.959]  They handle all the logistics, all the shipping.
[03:01:57.999 --> 03:02:00.120]  I mean, I'm sure you guys can appreciate that here, right?
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:01.461]  Logistics are a nightmare.
[03:02:01.801 --> 03:02:04.624]  I mean, the company does everything for you, so you're not having to do all that.
[03:02:04.924 --> 03:02:09.608]  You know, if you wanted to start up a traditional company out there, you've got to handle almost everything on your own, so it's great about this.
[03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:12.911]  You need $50 million to start a real nutrition.
[03:02:12.931 --> 03:02:14.172]  You do, you do, you do.
[03:02:14.252 --> 03:02:15.493]  I mean, what's great about this.
[03:02:15.794 --> 03:02:20.177]  I mean, you know, all these products, like you were talking about, I mean, look how good that they look.
[03:02:20.198 --> 03:02:23.380]  Yes, there's a lot of engineering and everything else, but... All I care about is how they work.
[03:02:24.241 --> 03:02:28.225]  They work, but they look great too, and what's great about it is Janess... They sell themselves.
[03:02:28.605 --> 03:02:30.607]  Janess paid for all that.
[03:02:30.647 --> 03:02:34.790]  Nobody was calling us to say, hey, this is going to cost this amount of money for us to engineer this.
[03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:35.551]  They handle all that.
[03:02:35.611 --> 03:02:36.112]  No, I get it.
[03:02:36.192 --> 03:02:39.294]  If I'm going to sell somebody's book or film, I go, listen, I need your film for 30%.
[03:02:40.515 --> 03:02:45.180]  Because I can't sell my product, and I've got all this infrastructure and all the attacks I'm under.
[03:02:46.806 --> 03:02:51.270]  And they go, but I need 50%, and I go, do you have any infrastructure?
[03:02:51.850 --> 03:02:52.911]  This is pure profit.
[03:02:53.011 --> 03:02:54.793]  And most people, they're just too dumb.
[03:02:56.294 --> 03:03:00.057]  I'm like, okay, I can't sell your product then, because you understand, I will go bankrupt!
[03:03:00.097 --> 03:03:01.739]  George Soros is suing me!
[03:03:02.139 --> 03:03:13.643]  Yeah, well, you know, going into the business part too, just one other thing too is, you know, according to Dave Ramsey, 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
[03:03:14.143 --> 03:03:17.505]  So I would say to most people that are out there today, how do you feel about that?
[03:03:17.585 --> 03:03:18.645]  Because, you know, one of the things we
[03:03:18.885 --> 03:03:20.346]  Because they look for one job.
[03:03:20.566 --> 03:03:24.670]  And I'm going to do a few more minutes after this than our other host is coming up.
[03:03:24.690 --> 03:03:25.090]  You're right.
[03:03:25.350 --> 03:03:28.793]  Everyone that I ever grew up with, my family were farmers and ranchers.
[03:03:28.813 --> 03:03:30.754]  They had pigs, they had chickens, they had cows.
[03:03:31.095 --> 03:03:33.336]  Sometimes the grass didn't grow good, so they had to sell cows.
[03:03:33.476 --> 03:03:34.417]  The pigs made them survive.
[03:03:34.697 --> 03:03:35.338]  Or it was eggs.
[03:03:35.718 --> 03:03:38.941]  Or they had moonshine stills running, you know, and did murder for hire on the side.
[03:03:38.981 --> 03:03:39.361]  I'm joking.
[03:03:39.641 --> 03:03:44.525]  The point is, is that you've got to have a lot of different jobs to take care of things.
[03:03:44.705 --> 03:03:45.045]  You do.
[03:03:45.185 --> 03:03:46.026]  You do.
[03:03:46.566 --> 03:03:55.171]  But the thing is, Alex, if you're going to start a business, if you're going to start something like this, for example, one of the cool things Jeunesse has is they have what's called an ambassador pack.
[03:03:55.271 --> 03:03:55.451]  Okay?
[03:03:55.471 --> 03:03:56.492]  It's about a thousand bucks.
[03:03:56.912 --> 03:03:57.072]  Okay?
[03:03:57.092 --> 03:03:58.053]  It's an ambassador pack.
[03:03:58.753 --> 03:04:05.217]  Where you get a ton of product, you get all the marketing, you get your website, where are you going to go start your own home-based business for a grand?
[03:04:07.070 --> 03:04:08.531]  No, the infrastructure is there.
[03:04:08.892 --> 03:04:10.113]  It's kick-ass products.
[03:04:10.493 --> 03:04:15.038]  All I bring you is win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[03:04:15.298 --> 03:04:17.961]  Because I will not metaphysically bring you to something that's a bad deal.
[03:04:18.402 --> 03:04:20.204]  This is InfoWars.
[03:04:20.344 --> 03:04:22.266]  Yes.com is the next level.
[03:04:24.116 --> 03:04:28.177]  People should just try the Jeunesse Mind.
[03:04:28.257 --> 03:04:30.018]  They should try the antioxidant.
[03:04:30.038 --> 03:04:31.118]  They should try the skin cream.
[03:04:31.138 --> 03:04:32.219]  They should try the energy drinks.
[03:04:32.579 --> 03:04:33.199]  They should do it!
[03:04:33.619 --> 03:04:35.500]  And support m4restore.com and our products as well.
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:37.881]  It's just that it's good with them trying to shut us down.
[03:04:38.901 --> 03:04:42.342]  You know, they're openly saying, shut my shopping carts down, trying to take my banking away.
[03:04:42.642 --> 03:04:44.503]  They want to bankrupt us because we're bringing America back.
[03:04:44.943 --> 03:04:51.935]  We're gonna come back and finish up with you, my friend, and throw the baton to Anthony Comey of CompoundMedia.com in T-minus 60 seconds straight ahead.
[03:04:52.356 --> 03:04:54.319]  Have you spread the InfoWars.com link today?
[03:04:54.339 --> 03:04:56.102]  Have you told folks by that local station?
[03:04:56.182 --> 03:04:56.482]  Please do.
[03:05:12.125 --> 03:05:18.386]  After the success of Alpha Power, we decided to make a new powerhouse vitality formula built with the female biochemistry in mind.
[03:05:19.127 --> 03:05:24.008]  After searching for the incredible ingredients to meet those needs, we're proud to bring you Ultimate Female Force.
[03:05:24.768 --> 03:05:28.188]  All Info Warriors know how important keeping up with their vitality truly is.

[03:06:07.350 --> 03:06:09.310]  We are on the march.
[03:06:09.370 --> 03:06:12.591]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:06:12.691 --> 03:06:14.512]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:06:14.812 --> 03:06:17.592]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to land.
[03:06:17.672 --> 03:06:22.793]  You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me.
[03:06:22.873 --> 03:06:26.334]  The pleasure is to play.
[03:06:26.974 --> 03:06:33.956]  Make no difference what you say.
[03:07:14.758 --> 03:07:17.759]  All right, Conrad Padilla is our guest.
[03:07:18.280 --> 03:07:24.303]  We're talking about funding ourselves here with one of the number one companies out there.
[03:07:25.003 --> 03:07:26.124]  And I'm very, very excited.
[03:07:26.184 --> 03:07:27.705]  If you want to just go buy the products, that's great.
[03:07:27.725 --> 03:07:30.366]  If you want to be a distributor and really kick ass, that's great.
[03:07:30.406 --> 03:07:31.167]  It sells itself.
[03:07:31.747 --> 03:07:32.387]  Infowars.
[03:07:33.348 --> 03:07:34.208]  Yes.com.
[03:07:34.889 --> 03:07:36.730]  In closing, I'm very proud of the work you've done.
[03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:38.991]  I've had hundreds and hundreds of offers.
[03:07:40.049 --> 03:07:40.409]  To do MLM.
[03:08:00.243 --> 03:08:13.853]  If they don't become distributors for this, try the products first, M4sYes.com, then become a distributor, and sell your family, your neighbors on it, and then, you know, get like 10 customers that'll pay for your monthly supply.
[03:08:14.694 --> 03:08:16.255]  But hey, go really crazy.
[03:08:16.695 --> 03:08:17.456]  Open a storefront.
[03:08:17.936 --> 03:08:21.939]  Because, I mean, I was reading, like, you guys are already number one in, like, more than a dozen countries.
[03:08:21.959 --> 03:08:23.440]  You're number five worldwide.
[03:08:23.460 --> 03:08:24.741]  You haven't really pushed in the U.S.
[03:08:24.781 --> 03:08:25.002]  yet.
[03:08:25.862 --> 03:08:27.944]  Again, quantify why they didn't start in the U.S.
[03:08:27.964 --> 03:08:28.104]  yet.
[03:08:28.124 --> 03:08:29.185]  A multi-billion dollar company.
[03:08:29.665 --> 03:08:32.489]  Well, the key is they wanted to see if the company can make it first.
[03:08:32.549 --> 03:08:33.790]  So that's why they started in Indonesia.
[03:08:34.271 --> 03:08:37.735]  This is the biggest direct selling network marketing country in the world.
[03:08:37.755 --> 03:08:40.037]  And so what I would say, you know, give credit to Alex.
[03:08:40.077 --> 03:08:41.239]  I'm really glad that I could be here today.
[03:08:41.259 --> 03:08:42.380]  But credit Alex.
[03:08:42.841 --> 03:08:44.763]  Listen, this guy's a really good business guy.
[03:08:44.923 --> 03:08:45.984]  And I'm going to tell you guys this.
[03:08:46.544 --> 03:08:51.227]  If you're seeing him get involved in something, you really, really should probably do the same thing.
[03:08:51.527 --> 03:08:59.913]  So I think it's really, really important for you guys to understand that, you know, you guys have the opportunity right now to actually help us expand the market.
[03:08:59.953 --> 03:09:01.934]  Oh, I want to give our listeners a ground floor.
[03:09:02.474 --> 03:09:05.837]  And the product's so good, I think it goes on forever unless an asteroid hits the Earth.
[03:09:06.617 --> 03:09:08.278]  You know, the company's so good.
[03:09:08.418 --> 03:09:10.179]  I mean, I'm just saying.
[03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:14.202]  I want listeners like they've done to just come to me and say, thank God you got me involved in that.
[03:09:14.402 --> 03:09:16.883]  You told me to buy gold that was 300 an ounce.
[03:09:17.163 --> 03:09:17.884]  You told me to get out at 2,000.
[03:09:18.384 --> 03:09:21.926]  And then I sold it all, and I made 20 million dollars, and you were right!
[03:09:21.946 --> 03:09:22.787]  And I'm like, yes!
[03:09:23.047 --> 03:09:24.868]  I said get out of gold at the top!
[03:09:25.088 --> 03:09:26.289]  I didn't keep selling it to you!
[03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:27.309]  I said get out of it!
[03:09:27.810 --> 03:09:29.391]  And I had sponsors threatening to sue me.
[03:09:29.411 --> 03:09:30.871]  They're like, you're gonna keep pitching gold.
[03:09:30.892 --> 03:09:31.292]  And I said,
[03:09:32.250 --> 03:09:33.491]  Jump off a cliff!
[03:09:36.032 --> 03:09:37.372]  That's how this works.
[03:09:38.893 --> 03:09:39.613]  Sometimes I'm wrong.
[03:09:39.673 --> 03:09:40.014]  Rarely.
[03:09:40.294 --> 03:09:42.155]  I'm going to tell you what the hit is.
[03:09:43.061 --> 03:09:45.623]  Again, like Robert Duvall says, I got a number one show!
[03:09:45.643 --> 03:09:47.325]  It's a big you-know-what hit!
[03:09:47.385 --> 03:09:48.085]  Oh my God!
[03:09:48.306 --> 03:09:50.127]  I mean, I want big, juicy hits!
[03:09:50.728 --> 03:09:51.328]  That's what I want!
[03:09:51.508 --> 03:09:52.509]  Well, think about it like this.
[03:09:52.589 --> 03:09:55.532]  If Alex is right, this could potentially be huge for you.
[03:09:55.892 --> 03:09:57.273]  If it's wrong, your life's the same.
[03:09:57.293 --> 03:09:58.254]  So what do you have to lose?
[03:09:58.674 --> 03:10:00.356]  Well, you've got great products.
[03:10:00.496 --> 03:10:04.299]  Infowarsyes.com, and people can go there, and there's so many great deals there.
[03:10:04.319 --> 03:10:08.403]  There'll be distributors, so many exciting... So how do people get qualified where you guys didn't have matching funds?
[03:10:08.443 --> 03:10:09.624]  No one's ever done that in MLM.
[03:10:10.104 --> 03:10:13.728]  I don't call you a melon because it's all about the product, but how are you able to do something?
[03:10:13.768 --> 03:10:14.990]  I guess you're just so profitable.
[03:10:15.811 --> 03:10:25.181]  Well, the company, once again, the company is run by some very, very successful people, Randy and Wendy Lewis, and I will just tell you right now that they run this like a Fortune 500 company.
[03:10:25.241 --> 03:10:26.763]  It's run very, very well.
[03:10:26.863 --> 03:10:27.644]  It's like Bezos.
[03:10:27.684 --> 03:10:28.685]  He's putting everything back in.
[03:10:28.945 --> 03:10:36.475]  Yeah, they put a lot of money back into the company, but they also have money available to help people with, you know, getting their business to the next level and all sorts of different things.
[03:10:36.495 --> 03:10:38.858]  So, the company's just very, very well run.
[03:10:38.878 --> 03:10:42.303]  Because the one MLN I was involved with, they're great guys, they had good products, but there was like no help.
[03:10:42.743 --> 03:10:42.924]  Yeah.
[03:10:43.104 --> 03:10:46.208]  It's like, okay, the product's good, but like, I'm out here, like, that's what I like about Genes.
[03:10:46.328 --> 03:10:56.133]  Yeah, well, going back to once again, if you get the ambassador package, you have all the marketing materials, the websites, you know, the company handles everything for you to start your own, your own home-based business.
[03:10:56.173 --> 03:10:57.233]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[03:10:57.253 --> 03:10:59.154]  You know, you don't have to go figure this out.
[03:10:59.194 --> 03:11:03.216]  And you know, you know, Robert Kiyosaki, he wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad, number one selling financial book of all time.
[03:11:03.636 --> 03:11:11.660]  He says, the number one reason why I like the profession of network marketing is because it has, you can't find a better profession for personal development.
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:12.841]  It's who you become along the way.
[03:11:13.021 --> 03:11:16.165]  It teaches you to be a salesperson, but you've got to have a good product.
[03:11:16.426 --> 03:11:16.706]  You do.
[03:11:16.726 --> 03:11:21.412]  I mean, if you're selling, you know, dog turds, it's not going to be a very good business.
[03:11:21.432 --> 03:11:22.574]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you do.
[03:11:22.594 --> 03:11:29.923]  You have to have solid products, but you also have to have a solid model, but the key to it is it's all there.
[03:11:30.203 --> 03:11:30.924]  Everything is there.
[03:11:31.738 --> 03:11:33.300]  Alright, Conrad Padilla, great job.
[03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:34.601]  Infowarsyes.com.
[03:11:35.001 --> 03:11:35.962]  We're about to go to break in a few minutes.
[03:11:35.982 --> 03:11:36.563]  Stay right there.
[03:11:36.743 --> 03:11:39.405]  I want to introduce Anthony Comey, and I've just stolen 10 minutes from him.
[03:11:39.426 --> 03:11:40.066]  I apologize.
[03:11:40.106 --> 03:11:41.067]  Compoundmedia.com.
[03:11:41.528 --> 03:11:42.308]  He was on...
[03:11:43.251 --> 03:11:59.622]  Last Thursday, right before I got banned on Twitter, he banned on Twitter and Facebook, and then they said I bullied the jerk who brags at CNN that he got me banned everywhere, and so this guy's had the number one show on Terrestrial Radio, he's been number one on XM, what happens when you're number one?
[03:11:59.662 --> 03:12:09.868]  I mean, he was number one, because I get the ratings, he was number one in the markets he was in on Terrestrial Radio, so if he said poo-poo wrong, the FCC went after him, because he was a comic who was more libertarian conservative.
[03:12:10.429 --> 03:12:11.850]  You could be a leftist, you could stay on air.
[03:12:13.095 --> 03:12:15.837]  And so then he just said they're going to get everybody.
[03:12:15.858 --> 03:12:17.139]  Well, they got me that same day.
[03:12:17.179 --> 03:12:18.860]  They'd already purged me, but then they purged me.
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:26.607]  Then our app that was number one on Apple and Android, it's still on Android, InfoWars.com, they blocked that.
[03:12:27.288 --> 03:12:27.968]  It was number one.
[03:12:28.609 --> 03:12:30.070]  So they can't let us be winners.
[03:12:30.090 --> 03:12:34.254]  So you think when you're number one, you then are number one.
[03:12:34.314 --> 03:12:34.554]  No, no.
[03:12:34.594 --> 03:12:38.838]  In the real world, when you get the poll position, they don't give you champagne and a hot blonde.
[03:12:39.358 --> 03:12:41.399]  They take the champagne and crack it over your head.
[03:12:41.919 --> 03:12:43.840]  And so, Anthony Comey, we're at this point.
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:44.920]  What do you got coming up today?
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:46.680]  Oh my God.
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:49.121]  First of all, you're absolutely right.
[03:12:49.421 --> 03:12:54.363]  If you're inconsequential and no one's listening to you, they won't care.
[03:12:55.603 --> 03:12:56.704]  They might leave you alone.
[03:12:56.844 --> 03:12:57.384]  Maybe not.
[03:12:57.704 --> 03:13:03.306]  But if you're the likes of Alex Jones and you're saying things that are affecting their agenda,
[03:13:04.426 --> 03:13:06.147]  My God, they want you gone.
[03:13:06.647 --> 03:13:11.470]  And it's bizarre to think there's anyone out there that doesn't see this.
[03:13:11.790 --> 03:13:13.811]  That doesn't see it's obviously happening.
[03:13:14.131 --> 03:13:17.012]  I love how they were calling you a conspiracy theorist.
[03:13:17.032 --> 03:13:24.755]  It's like, what's the conspiracy theory in that Alex was saying they're going to take me off of social media and then they did!
[03:13:25.136 --> 03:13:26.876]  And then they're calling you this theorist.
[03:13:27.137 --> 03:13:28.857]  No, it is a conspiracy.
[03:13:29.157 --> 03:13:32.339]  It's a legitimate conspiracy to silence the voices
[03:13:32.859 --> 03:13:36.122]  And we know for years they've been censoring us, anybody that's successful.
[03:13:36.142 --> 03:13:40.326]  These executives, I never talked to you but I know what happens, it happened to me.
[03:13:40.346 --> 03:13:47.472]  They're always some jerk-off that's a sellout, they make less money than you, they call you in the office and they go,
[03:13:59.676 --> 03:14:02.238]  We want a new direction for your show or you're going to be off.
[03:14:29.936 --> 03:14:32.577]  I never talked to you about this, but let me guess.
[03:14:32.757 --> 03:14:35.118]  Have you had to be in the office with the corporate jerk-off?
[03:14:36.138 --> 03:14:37.859]  Oh, so many times.
[03:14:38.199 --> 03:14:45.522]  From the pinnacle of the corporate power, like at CBS, Les Moonves was my boss.
[03:14:46.662 --> 03:14:50.803]  You said shooting cops in the back of the head is wrong?
[03:14:51.104 --> 03:14:51.764]  You're fired!
[03:14:52.755 --> 03:15:06.539]  Yeah, it got to that point, and then the lowly program directors and general managers that tell you... You're a successful guy, and the people that know you, you ladies manhole-in-yarns, to have these nobodies who just want to mess with an alpha male.
[03:15:06.839 --> 03:15:08.460]  Like, they're pissed you're number one.
[03:15:08.660 --> 03:15:09.740]  People think you're number one.
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:10.140]  No, no, no.
[03:15:10.300 --> 03:15:11.681]  Being number one's not fun, folks.
[03:15:11.961 --> 03:15:12.401]  It's not fun.
[03:15:13.081 --> 03:15:14.142]  They failed!
[03:15:14.402 --> 03:15:16.203]  They failed at on-air!
[03:15:16.543 --> 03:15:22.106]  So what they want to do is tell you now how to do broadcast radio.
[03:15:22.527 --> 03:15:24.228]  And I've never taken their word.
[03:15:24.388 --> 03:15:25.468]  I've never listened to them.
[03:15:26.209 --> 03:15:29.211]  We've always gone against it and always been very successful.
[03:15:29.431 --> 03:15:32.452]  And now they want to just shut us completely off everywhere.
[03:15:32.653 --> 03:15:33.293]  Completely!
[03:15:33.393 --> 03:15:33.873]  Completely!
[03:15:34.073 --> 03:15:35.194]  They always say, build your own thing!
[03:15:35.274 --> 03:15:36.275]  Oh, now they want our websites!
[03:15:36.795 --> 03:15:38.236]  Now they want a credit card processing.
[03:15:38.577 --> 03:15:40.719]  We're going to come back with Anthony Comey, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:40.759 --> 03:15:41.619]  Comptownmedia.com.
[03:15:41.639 --> 03:15:43.981]  It is an act of rebellion against tyranny.
[03:15:44.001 --> 03:15:45.663]  To go there, get a subscription.
[03:15:45.723 --> 03:15:47.625]  Even if you don't use it, give it to your friends and family.
[03:15:47.945 --> 03:15:50.888]  If you don't support us now, we have no one.
[03:15:51.108 --> 03:15:52.049]  You are our lifeline.
[03:15:52.529 --> 03:15:54.911]  We are being destroyed because we're number one.
[03:15:54.951 --> 03:15:55.952]  Because you love us.
[03:15:56.072 --> 03:15:56.833]  We love you.
[03:15:57.213 --> 03:15:57.814]  We'll be back.
[03:16:06.616 --> 03:16:08.249]  You've got this evil Pope.
[03:16:09.312 --> 03:16:12.334]  At the end of the day is not the world cult a group of spiritual vampires?
[03:16:38.447 --> 03:16:38.988]  Absolutely.
[03:16:39.008 --> 03:16:41.450]  Spiritual and energetic vampires.
[03:16:41.530 --> 03:16:54.183]  We really need Alex to support Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who has made this bold move with this 11-page statement to ask the resignation of Pope Francis.
[03:16:54.343 --> 03:17:16.635]  We really need to support him because behind him, of course, there is also Trump, but there's also all those Catholics that are fed up with a religion which has been this big and manipulated by Pope Francis, and that is evidently and obviously corrupted by pedophilia left, right and center, and Pope Francis knew it.
[03:17:16.715 --> 03:17:23.078]  Now, it's the first time, Alex, that the Pope got actually cornered on the plane coming back from Dublin.
[03:17:24.219 --> 03:17:28.764]  Well, I have read the accusations of Carol Maria Viganò.
[03:17:30.025 --> 03:17:32.808]  You make your own decisions about it.
[03:17:33.749 --> 03:17:35.431]  I will not say anything more.
[03:17:35.891 --> 03:17:38.334]  Now, this is a very unusual statement.
[03:17:39.235 --> 03:17:43.039]  He was actually admitting that the accusation is true.
[03:17:43.732 --> 03:17:46.973]  But then he invited the journalists to make their own decision.
[03:17:47.013 --> 03:17:52.295]  Well, everybody here in Italy and around the world is demanding for the Pope's resignation.
[03:17:52.475 --> 03:17:58.958]  And this time, it's because of a direct involvement with a cover-up of a case of pedophilia.
[03:17:59.218 --> 03:18:05.040]  And of course, they wanted us off the major social networks.
[03:18:05.080 --> 03:18:08.782]  They wanted us censored before all this was coming out into light.
[03:18:09.662 --> 03:18:19.547]  Let's get to the bottom line.
[03:18:19.567 --> 03:18:21.767]  Do you think the Pope is about to resign A and B?
[03:18:22.308 --> 03:18:31.232]  Explain to people how these pedophile networks work because if you're talking 301 priests in Pennsylvania, that's most of the priests admitting they were raping little kids.
[03:18:31.312 --> 03:18:36.754]  I mean, that means chances are if you're looking at five Catholic priests, two or three of them are pedophiles now.
[03:18:36.974 --> 03:18:47.779]  The Vatican has definitely been at the highest level of this global pedophile network that now Donald J. Trump is really busting and fighting in an unprecedented way.
[03:18:47.799 --> 03:18:56.864]  So we are happy what is going on because Trump is forcing the Catholic Church in a corner now and the Pope might even resign.
[03:18:57.344 --> 03:19:04.926]  Clearly, this is a sign of a deep state war that from Brazil to the US to Italy to Australia, they're busting these people and we said that would happen.
[03:19:05.126 --> 03:19:06.207]  That's what my sources said.
[03:19:06.287 --> 03:19:09.607]  Trump and others, also patriots in Europe, are moving against this network.
[03:19:09.768 --> 03:19:12.948]  We have even nuns now that got arrested.
[03:19:13.249 --> 03:19:25.312]  Even a 93-year-old nun in Scotland is investigated because of molesting children and making them eat their own vomit and participating to satanic rituals with nuns.
[03:19:25.872 --> 03:19:27.894]  And this is happening in Scotland just now.
[03:19:27.914 --> 03:19:33.297]  So it's not only happening with priests or with cardinals, bishops, it's happening also with nuns.
[03:19:33.698 --> 03:19:34.338]  This is the key.
[03:19:34.678 --> 03:19:37.400]  Hiding in plain view in the Pennsylvania papers, and the indictment is.
[03:19:37.921 --> 03:19:40.583]  And then they'd make them read out of the Bible while they had sex with them.
[03:19:40.823 --> 03:19:43.345]  Then they'd do this with crosses, then they'd do that with blood.
[03:19:43.685 --> 03:19:48.108]  They're doing satanic rituals in pentagrams in the church.
[03:19:49.009 --> 03:19:50.369]  This is what satanists do.
[03:19:50.670 --> 03:19:51.951]  It's called blasphemy.
[03:19:52.271 --> 03:19:54.532]  And the satanists have taken over the Catholic Church.
[03:20:05.586 --> 03:20:17.496]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.398 --> 03:20:25.663]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:20:25.683 --> 03:20:27.985]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:49.093 --> 03:20:59.840]  So I had this whacked out interview a couple nights ago at the Fairmont Hotel, I guess two nights ago, with Patrick Bet-David, this big billionaire insurance company owner, who's got a viral YouTube channel.
[03:20:59.860 --> 03:21:05.244]  You know, their average video has 5 million views, so he wanted to, and he'd been this army spook guy and everything.
[03:21:05.784 --> 03:21:13.309]  So I go in this meeting, and there's all these Armenian dudes in this hotel interviewing me, and I'm like in a spy novel, and I've
[03:21:15.196 --> 03:21:16.017]  I'm not going to get into the whole story.
[03:21:16.037 --> 03:21:16.938]  It just gets weirder from there.
[03:21:17.839 --> 03:21:20.702]  But the interview is up there and it's pretty good.
[03:21:20.742 --> 03:21:22.083]  You see my big fat belly hanging out.
[03:21:23.024 --> 03:21:25.066]  But it's pretty fun.
[03:21:25.427 --> 03:21:27.109]  And we're up there drinking whiskey too.
[03:21:27.129 --> 03:21:33.095]  I think he was trying to get me drunk and then I think he actually got more drunk than I did because I was actually just drinking Coca-Cola.
[03:21:33.175 --> 03:21:33.595]  I'm joking.
[03:21:34.536 --> 03:21:36.258]  But getting serious.
[03:21:37.279 --> 03:21:49.263]  And getting back to Anthony Comey, Anthony Comey again has been number one on Threshold Radio, number one on XM, and I keep saying that because if you're number one, but you don't do what they want, they try to shut you down.
[03:21:49.363 --> 03:21:50.164]  Like, take PewDiePie.
[03:21:51.424 --> 03:21:54.925]  If you're not 15 years old or younger, you're like, who is that?
[03:21:55.286 --> 03:21:58.447]  Let me tell you, PewDiePie has talked about me
[03:21:59.983 --> 03:22:01.544]  Maybe 10 times in the last few years.
[03:22:01.624 --> 03:22:02.745]  Most of it in the last month.
[03:22:03.105 --> 03:22:06.347]  I literally go to the shopping mall, the grocery store...
[03:22:07.541 --> 03:22:11.744]  Children begin acting like I'm Elvis Presley, okay, in 1957.
[03:22:12.885 --> 03:22:21.671]  I mean, you know, it is, it is, it is everything but young girls throwing their panties at me because he has 22 billion views on YouTube.
[03:22:21.811 --> 03:22:22.191]  22 billion views.
[03:22:22.691 --> 03:22:24.353]  He has 65 million subscribers.
[03:22:24.513 --> 03:22:25.553]  That's only one thing he does.
[03:22:25.854 --> 03:22:31.798]  They came to him two years ago and said, we're going to shut you down, even though he's not political, unless you go under our control.
[03:22:32.618 --> 03:22:34.921]  Nobody's got that many views, but that's what I'm saying.
[03:22:34.981 --> 03:22:37.945]  They want control of what's popular.
[03:22:38.345 --> 03:22:39.547]  These are vampires.
[03:22:40.107 --> 03:22:42.971]  And so they're trying to shut me down, and I want Comey to take over and do his own show.
[03:22:42.991 --> 03:22:48.998]  We're honored to have him here with compoundmedia.com, but I want to believe the Streisand effect is going to backfire on him.
[03:22:49.799 --> 03:22:52.100]  And yes, we have a larger hardcore audience than ever.
[03:22:52.180 --> 03:22:54.902]  But, you look at the track, it's not like Spikes now.
[03:22:55.462 --> 03:23:00.705]  It's this big, not flatline, it's kind of going up, but it's this new, only the hardcore are listening.
[03:23:01.346 --> 03:23:06.449]  And it's this digital no-man's land, and they call it a global social score.
[03:23:06.509 --> 03:23:09.931]  And I've been on the phone with the White House and the Pentagon and...
[03:23:10.891 --> 03:23:13.932]  Fox News contributors, I'm going, read this document.
[03:23:14.592 --> 03:23:16.353]  Google is working with the Chinese.
[03:23:16.393 --> 03:23:18.994]  They believe it's a takeover and they're finally getting it.
[03:23:19.434 --> 03:23:22.936]  But I don't want it to be too late, 54 days out from the election, Anthony.
[03:23:23.256 --> 03:23:29.618]  I mean, we cannot underestimate this takeover is so un-American, so dangerous, so crazy.
[03:23:29.938 --> 03:23:31.819]  So on one hand, yeah, people want freedom.
[03:23:31.859 --> 03:23:32.979]  It shows America isn't dumb.
[03:23:33.580 --> 03:23:36.020]  But on the other hand, they are coming down on us.
[03:23:36.060 --> 03:23:39.302]  So I don't want to sit here and say, oh, Streisand effect, it blew up in their face.
[03:23:40.540 --> 03:23:43.361]  You'd probably much rather be on 200 radio stations than be number one.
[03:23:43.381 --> 03:23:44.922]  You'd probably much rather be number one on XM.
[03:23:44.942 --> 03:23:47.683]  You had to do it yourself, and now they want to take that away.
[03:23:48.004 --> 03:23:57.028]  Now they're taking pro- whether you hate Israel, love Israel, they're taking pro-Israel groups' visa away?
[03:23:57.448 --> 03:24:00.910]  I mean, they're trying to take my payment services away?
[03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:03.751]  I mean, it's not like we're 10 steps from tyranny.
[03:24:04.071 --> 03:24:05.332]  We're walking in the door.
[03:24:07.105 --> 03:24:09.767]  When you hear people say, well, do it yourself.
[03:24:10.147 --> 03:24:12.488]  And we have to the extent that we can.
[03:24:12.868 --> 03:24:27.197]  As far as we've gone with InfoWars and myself with Compound Media and a few other places online, we can't get on telephone poles and start stringing fiber optic cable to get our own infrastructure.
[03:24:27.637 --> 03:24:34.241]  And there will always be someone over your head that holds the power to shut you down.
[03:24:34.261 --> 03:24:36.202]  And if they don't like what you're saying,
[03:24:36.582 --> 03:24:38.623]  It's like jumping in on people in a phone conversation.
[03:24:38.643 --> 03:24:39.523]  That's the perfect analogy.
[03:24:39.763 --> 03:24:41.784]  They're literally trying to kick us off the backbone!
[03:24:42.905 --> 03:24:48.887]  Yeah, and look, I am the last person that would clamor for any type of regulation.
[03:24:49.827 --> 03:24:54.930]  I'm a libertarian for the most part, and I don't like the idea of that.
[03:24:55.170 --> 03:25:00.872]  But when you have a company like Google that is responsible for way over 90% of the search results,
[03:25:03.713 --> 03:25:11.460]  And they're dictating what people see on that front page when you Google search something, and only 5% of the people ever hit the next page!
[03:25:12.001 --> 03:25:17.906]  It's literally, they are putting, if you put Alex Jones in... 96% is force-fed liberal garbage.
[03:25:18.687 --> 03:25:19.268]  Insane!
[03:25:19.308 --> 03:25:24.014]  If you put in Alex Jones on Google or Anthony Comey... All you get is negative crap.
[03:25:24.374 --> 03:25:25.055]  Garbage!
[03:25:25.416 --> 03:25:25.756]  Yes!
[03:25:25.996 --> 03:25:29.881]  And because that's what they want the people to see.
[03:25:29.941 --> 03:25:30.823]  Oh, the same thing.
[03:25:30.863 --> 03:25:35.128]  They say you want trannies and then now I guess somehow I want trannies.
[03:25:35.128 --> 03:25:35.608]  I don't think so.
[03:25:57.725 --> 03:25:59.186]  Well, I have no idea.
[03:25:59.206 --> 03:26:01.728]  Yeah, it's been pinned on so many people.
[03:26:02.129 --> 03:26:13.938]  And the most ridiculous part of it, I believe, is their whole take is that we should be inclusive and accepting of people of different genders and whatnot.
[03:26:14.338 --> 03:26:26.187]  And then when they want to try to nail you, they say that you have this affinity for certain sexualities that you're supposed to, as they say, be tolerant towards.
[03:26:26.427 --> 03:26:29.930]  So I don't really get their point on this whole thing.
[03:26:30.290 --> 03:26:32.852]  The weirdness of the globalists, I can't figure it out sometimes.
[03:26:32.892 --> 03:26:34.253]  It's like, it's crazy.
[03:26:35.271 --> 03:26:36.892]  It is insanity.
[03:26:37.172 --> 03:26:39.073]  And they know what sticks.
[03:26:39.113 --> 03:26:40.173]  They know what makes a noise.
[03:26:40.413 --> 03:26:49.318]  That's why we've just seen this coming out about Kavanaugh with Dianne Feinstein that says there's a Me Too problem in his past.
[03:26:50.018 --> 03:26:50.158]  Uh-oh!
[03:26:50.598 --> 03:27:01.003]  We ought to postpone the vote until the FBI... Oh my God, if some woman claims he ever asked her out, it's like the pubic hair on the Coke.
[03:27:02.456 --> 03:27:03.637]  It's the same thing.
[03:27:03.677 --> 03:27:11.620]  They know what is going to get them coverage and they know what that dog whistle is going to be that's going to get people's ears up.
[03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:13.241]  They're talking about something from 1983.
[03:27:13.421 --> 03:27:24.685]  Oh, I love how Jim Jordan exposes all their corruption and so they go, 30 years ago at a school there was a rumor that somebody hit on a kid.
[03:27:25.006 --> 03:27:25.706]  They don't even say it.
[03:27:25.726 --> 03:27:27.166]  It's like, oh my god, Jim Jordan!
[03:27:27.387 --> 03:27:28.967]  And now, look at that ThinkProgress headline.
[03:27:28.987 --> 03:27:29.668]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[03:27:30.188 --> 03:27:30.548]  It's like,
[03:27:31.889 --> 03:27:36.693]  Brett Kavanaugh has a mysterious hashtag me too problem and federal investigators are involved and there's no proof.
[03:27:36.713 --> 03:27:41.977]  They just say, you know, someone claims Jones was caught having sex with Martians in his basement.
[03:27:43.498 --> 03:27:44.959]  There's no proof of it.
[03:27:45.400 --> 03:27:47.822]  And look, something's got to be done about this.
[03:27:48.062 --> 03:27:54.307]  You can't just anonymously and without any kind of backup sources.
[03:27:54.387 --> 03:27:57.489]  I'll just say that I got divorced.
[03:27:57.630 --> 03:27:58.811]  I got divorced four years ago.
[03:27:59.571 --> 03:28:03.916]  And I dated a bunch of chicks, and one of these chicks called up and said, you better give me money or I'm gonna say something.
[03:28:03.936 --> 03:28:04.457]  You know what I said?
[03:28:04.737 --> 03:28:06.059]  I'm going to the FBI right now.
[03:28:06.099 --> 03:28:08.021]  I got in the car and drove the FBI.
[03:28:08.262 --> 03:28:09.563]  She shut her mouth up real quick.
[03:28:10.124 --> 03:28:11.786]  I've never pushed anything on anybody.
[03:28:12.006 --> 03:28:12.667]  That's what I mean, though.
[03:28:12.687 --> 03:28:13.788]  They just think I'm gonna take this?
[03:28:13.848 --> 03:28:14.910]  I'm not taking it anymore, man.
[03:28:15.763 --> 03:28:17.764]  No, and more people have to do that.
[03:28:18.064 --> 03:28:22.645]  We can't keep apologizing for things that never happened or might have happened.
[03:28:23.145 --> 03:28:28.547]  No, the love is jumping on top of you at a bar, and then you take her to the hotel room.
[03:28:28.607 --> 03:28:29.427]  You haven't done anything.
[03:28:29.527 --> 03:28:31.347]  I'm not going to sit there and put up with this.
[03:28:32.608 --> 03:28:32.788]  Yeah.
[03:28:33.608 --> 03:28:34.388]  What do you got coming up?
[03:28:34.408 --> 03:28:36.489]  Because I don't want to dominate this whole thing that I'm having fun talking to.
[03:28:37.213 --> 03:28:37.633]  All good.
[03:28:37.673 --> 03:28:44.818]  We're going to talk about Hollywood, Les Moonves, and Jeff Fager from 60 Minutes.
[03:28:45.178 --> 03:28:47.840]  A little bit about the hurricane and how it's all Trump's fault.
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:49.641]  And a few other tidbits.
[03:28:49.701 --> 03:28:51.162]  Oh, I never covered that today.
[03:28:51.282 --> 03:28:53.963]  Actually, the Washington Post said it's Trump's fault.
[03:28:53.983 --> 03:28:54.264]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:54.284 --> 03:28:57.145]  Alright, Anthony Comey is straight ahead.

[03:30:10.549 --> 03:30:14.511]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[03:30:15.031 --> 03:30:21.014]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[03:30:21.494 --> 03:30:27.539]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[03:30:27.979 --> 03:30:39.509]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[03:30:39.969 --> 03:30:49.237]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[03:30:49.798 --> 03:30:53.567]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.

[03:31:01.354 --> 03:31:05.176]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[03:32:01.474 --> 03:32:06.198]  He's made it more popular, I think, to be openly racist.
[03:32:06.358 --> 03:32:11.482]  Because this president, I will quote, quote Steve Schmitt, is a stone-cold racist.
[03:32:11.902 --> 03:32:13.683]  They must be really hitting this tone hard right now.
[03:32:13.703 --> 03:32:14.584]  That's the talking point.
[03:32:14.624 --> 03:32:15.065]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:32:15.225 --> 03:32:17.646]  So this is the... Trump just signed a thing that will save millions of people!
[03:32:17.907 --> 03:32:18.907]  RACIST!
[03:32:19.428 --> 03:32:20.329]  The economy's coming back!
[03:32:20.589 --> 03:32:21.730]  RACIST!
[03:32:22.110 --> 03:32:25.232]  All the numbers say the Republicans are going to win Congress in the midterms!
[03:32:25.392 --> 03:32:26.373]  RACIST!
[03:32:26.573 --> 03:32:30.556]  Oh my god, the giant blue wave, now a red wave, the historic Trump's dominating!
[03:32:31.657 --> 03:32:31.877]  RACIST!
[03:32:31.897 --> 03:32:32.538]  Oh my gosh!
[03:32:32.818 --> 03:32:37.240]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power!
[03:32:37.280 --> 03:32:38.420]  It must be racist!
[03:32:38.480 --> 03:32:41.502]  MSRT can't torture little girls to death for Satan!
[03:32:41.642 --> 03:32:42.702]  RACIST!
[03:32:42.802 --> 03:32:46.644]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes!
[03:32:46.724 --> 03:32:47.204]  RACIST!
[03:32:47.464 --> 03:32:58.509]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:05.106 --> 03:33:07.987]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:08.207 --> 03:33:14.170]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[03:33:14.890 --> 03:33:20.752]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your planes?
[03:33:21.113 --> 03:33:22.173]  You're the pretender!
[03:33:41.139 --> 03:33:42.620]  I'm the enemy!
[03:33:42.780 --> 03:33:46.501]  Who are you?
[03:33:46.681 --> 03:33:48.441]  I am America, baby!
[03:34:08.297 --> 03:34:12.159]  Alright, Anthony Comey has taken over and he's going to host the show next Thursday.
[03:34:12.179 --> 03:34:17.322]  Because I've got a wonderful, happy little court event I've got to go to.
[03:34:17.482 --> 03:34:19.443]  All part of the fun.
[03:34:19.804 --> 03:34:21.284]  So the host of Compound Media will host that.
[03:34:21.364 --> 03:34:22.945]  Owen Schroer is going to host the day before that.
[03:34:23.025 --> 03:34:23.886]  David Knight the next day.
[03:34:25.067 --> 03:34:29.289]  I'm going to get out of here and let him take over because why have him host if I'm just going to take over.
[03:34:29.309 --> 03:34:30.089]  But two little plugs.
[03:34:30.109 --> 03:34:33.972]  Like I said, this interview, Alex Jones, I'm ready to die.
[03:34:34.032 --> 03:34:35.613]  Exclusive interview after being banned.
[03:34:35.953 --> 03:34:37.594]  Boy, that's a cool headline.
[03:34:38.496 --> 03:34:40.758]  But it's true, so there you go.
[03:34:41.398 --> 03:34:43.100]  No surrender, globalists.
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:44.241]  No surrender.
[03:34:44.721 --> 03:34:46.343]  Death before dishonor.
[03:34:48.785 --> 03:34:54.289]  So, the whole point is, is that we're going to tweet that out.
[03:34:54.489 --> 03:34:55.350]  I'm on Twitter, sorry.
[03:34:55.730 --> 03:34:56.831]  You have to tweet us out.
[03:34:58.092 --> 03:35:02.516]  But InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, support us.
[03:35:02.896 --> 03:35:03.937]  We're nowhere without you.
[03:35:04.077 --> 03:35:05.579]  And then separately, here's the deal.
[03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:17.864]  I studied, going back like 20 years ago, with top medical doctors, scientists, why are they putting bromine, fluoride, chlorine in the water when they've got other stuff to kill bacteria?
[03:35:17.904 --> 03:35:19.025]  And why are they doing fluoride?
[03:35:19.045 --> 03:35:22.686]  It's like drinking sunscreen, claiming you don't want to get skin cancer.
[03:35:23.086 --> 03:35:24.587]  Why are you drinking fluoride for your teeth?
[03:35:24.607 --> 03:35:25.487]  You put it on topically.
[03:35:25.848 --> 03:35:30.629]  And it's not the good fluoride, calcium fluoride, it's the hydrofluorosilicic acid, which is actually a weaponized fluoride.
[03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:33.831]  It'll eat through concrete or steel, like alien blood.
[03:35:34.571 --> 03:35:38.398]  So, the good alien blood is Survival Shield X2.
[03:35:38.859 --> 03:35:44.328]  Now, the jerk-offs in the corporate world know that we have a DEA license through a top manufacturer.
[03:35:45.373 --> 03:35:47.293]  In a state I won't mention, to have this.
[03:35:47.453 --> 03:35:48.894]  This is unbelievable.
[03:35:49.674 --> 03:35:51.154]  They jacked with it.
[03:35:51.914 --> 03:35:53.895]  And so they increased prices, they did a bunch of other stuff.
[03:35:54.235 --> 03:35:55.815]  So I said, no more.
[03:35:55.955 --> 03:35:59.376]  And I broke my contract, and this is the last run of X2.
[03:35:59.396 --> 03:36:03.637]  Now we may get a new one, but it's going to take six months to a year, conservatively.
[03:36:03.697 --> 03:36:12.559]  So if you want your X2 with 98% reviews, 6,126 reviews, power reviews, if you want to find out what the good halogen is versus the bad halogen,
[03:36:13.479 --> 03:36:16.681]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA253-3139.
[03:36:18.002 --> 03:36:19.883]  And get a t-shirt, get a book, whatever.
[03:36:20.384 --> 03:36:23.566]  Let me tell you, you want to piss Soros off, they hit me with everything they got.
[03:36:23.606 --> 03:36:35.494]  They had history channel shows, Discovery Channel shows, comedy shows, HBO shows, Showtime shows, Homeland, going, I'm Alex Jones and I love the Nazis!
[03:36:36.075 --> 03:36:38.776]  And then it, and I didn't say that.
[03:36:39.837 --> 03:36:40.598]  Why'd they do that?
[03:36:41.414 --> 03:36:46.136]  Because they wanted to set me up as the first domino to bring the whole thing down.
[03:36:46.656 --> 03:36:47.396]  And now they're doing it!
[03:36:48.356 --> 03:36:49.957]  So, it's one hell of a fight.
[03:36:50.037 --> 03:36:50.937]  It's crazy town.
[03:36:51.657 --> 03:36:53.658]  And you're... because we need our own voice.
[03:36:54.578 --> 03:37:05.142]  They want to silence me so they can then say that, you know, I'm having gay orgies with trannies, and I'm in a KKK, and I love Hitler, and I raped an Easter Bunny last night.
[03:37:06.123 --> 03:37:09.371]  So that I can't respond to that, but the good news is we're still here.
[03:37:09.992 --> 03:37:10.754]  And you're spreading the word.
[03:37:10.794 --> 03:37:11.556]  Right now they're losing.
[03:37:12.836 --> 03:37:14.036]  So, they really don't know what to do.
[03:37:14.857 --> 03:37:16.577]  They might bust a cap in my ass, whatever.
[03:37:16.917 --> 03:37:28.000]  AnthonyCumiaCompoundMedia.com is taking over, but whatever you do, X2, the final run, InfoWarsTore.com, funding us, gets you great products, and really sticks, you know what, in the eye of the globalists.
[03:37:28.040 --> 03:37:28.800]  So, thank you.
[03:37:29.100 --> 03:37:32.361]  Anthony, look forward to you next Thursday hosting the main transmission, my friend.
[03:37:33.121 --> 03:37:33.701]  Takeover.
[03:37:33.781 --> 03:37:36.222]  I'm sorry I boarded the broadcast, but I love talking to you.
[03:37:36.382 --> 03:37:37.322]  You're one of my favorite hosts.
[03:37:37.522 --> 03:37:40.283]  I mean, because you're popular on the show, but I think you should be the most popular.
[03:37:41.261 --> 03:37:44.822]  You are just so much fun to watch.
[03:37:45.202 --> 03:37:46.482]  I'm a fan first.
[03:37:46.682 --> 03:37:52.923]  I mean, I love the idea that you would even have me as a host because I'm a fan first, man.
[03:37:52.943 --> 03:37:55.904]  You make me laugh my ass off.
[03:37:56.224 --> 03:37:59.705]  You inform and your ball's out right there.
[03:38:01.385 --> 03:38:01.845]  You're in it.
[03:38:02.245 --> 03:38:02.806]  You're in it.
[03:38:03.246 --> 03:38:04.166]  And I love that.
[03:38:04.226 --> 03:38:05.066]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[03:38:05.086 --> 03:38:06.166]  We love Compound Media, brother.
[03:38:06.206 --> 03:38:06.906]  We're all in this together.
[03:38:06.926 --> 03:38:07.487]  And that's the thing.
[03:38:07.527 --> 03:38:08.947]  These betas and these globalists,
[03:38:09.867 --> 03:38:11.707]  A real alpha male doesn't want to run other people.
[03:38:11.927 --> 03:38:12.548]  We're confident.
[03:38:12.908 --> 03:38:15.828]  But the problem is we don't want to run stuff so the trash takes over.
[03:38:16.068 --> 03:38:17.049]  So talk about that paradigm.
[03:38:17.129 --> 03:38:18.109]  I mean, you got a lot to cover.
[03:38:18.169 --> 03:38:18.489]  I'm out of here.
[03:38:18.529 --> 03:38:18.749]  Go ahead.
[03:38:20.029 --> 03:38:20.349]  Awesome.
[03:38:20.849 --> 03:38:27.651]  Yeah, I love the idea that you're banned from Twitter and I'm banned from Twitter and Facebook and all social media.
[03:38:27.911 --> 03:38:31.612]  And then I see, because look, I got a way of looking at Twitter.
[03:38:32.512 --> 03:38:33.332]  I figure it out.
[03:38:34.972 --> 03:38:36.753]  Actually, verified Twitter accounts.
[03:38:37.253 --> 03:38:38.313]  Louis Farrakhan.
[03:38:39.171 --> 03:38:54.123]  Is Alex Jones and Anthony Comeo worse than Minister Louis Farrakhan, who over the course of the years has just said the most repugnant things about Jewish people and others?
[03:38:55.524 --> 03:38:57.286]  And Ahmadinejad!
[03:38:58.058 --> 03:39:05.126]  You might remember him, head muckety-muck of Iran, and a former head muckety-muck of Iran.
[03:39:05.467 --> 03:39:08.450]  And in 1979, you could see pictures of him!
[03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.971]  Pop him up!
[03:39:09.351 --> 03:39:16.699]  He was one of the mechanics of the Americans being held hostage during the 1979-1980.
[03:39:19.956 --> 03:39:20.517]  In Iran.
[03:39:21.077 --> 03:39:27.483]  And he, by the way, is a verified account holder at Twitter.
[03:39:27.583 --> 03:39:33.147]  But meanwhile, the likes of, yes, Alex Jones and myself are worried.
[03:39:33.227 --> 03:39:34.769]  I said I'd leave, but here's the deal.
[03:39:34.789 --> 03:39:37.431]  Even though I disagree with what Farrakhan says, I've interviewed him.
[03:39:37.571 --> 03:39:38.612]  I think he has a right.
[03:39:38.892 --> 03:39:40.714]  We're not saying get rid of him.
[03:39:40.754 --> 03:39:43.196]  We're saying let Anthony Comey and Alex Jones be on there.
[03:39:44.545 --> 03:39:48.707]  That's it, I never... Look, I am an absolutist when it comes to free speech.
[03:39:49.167 --> 03:39:51.168]  I don't care what Farrakhan has to say.
[03:39:51.489 --> 03:39:53.750]  I enjoy listening to some of Farrakhan's stuff.
[03:39:54.270 --> 03:39:57.412]  It really gives you kind of an outlook on what he's all about.
[03:39:57.452 --> 03:39:58.412]  He's quite an orator.
[03:39:59.273 --> 03:40:00.853]  Oh my goodness, yes he is.
[03:40:00.873 --> 03:40:03.094]  I like how he talks about himself in the third person.
[03:40:03.535 --> 03:40:07.917]  And the minister would say to you, and it's like, well you are, you're the minister.
[03:40:08.982 --> 03:40:13.405]  But the likes of him and Ahmadinejad, they have verified accounts.
[03:40:13.445 --> 03:40:25.273]  Twitter has deemed them acceptable to be on Twitter, which is fine, like you said, but we, Alex, are a pariah that needs to be removed for the sake of...
[03:40:25.953 --> 03:40:28.294]  He wrote over 20 articles that called for me to be banned.
[03:40:28.314 --> 03:40:30.816]  He lied about me and got me banned on 27th.
[03:40:30.836 --> 03:40:31.576]  They gave him credit.
[03:40:31.756 --> 03:40:36.899]  And I see this jerk and I walk over and I go, hey man, you're like a Hitler Youth burning books getting me banned.
[03:40:37.219 --> 03:40:40.141]  And they said, calling him Hitler Youth is bullying.
[03:40:40.361 --> 03:40:41.241]  He's a public figure.
[03:40:41.301 --> 03:40:42.542]  He's in public as a reporter.
[03:40:42.782 --> 03:40:43.583]  He got me banned.
[03:40:43.603 --> 03:40:44.263]  He bullied me.
[03:40:44.663 --> 03:40:47.044]  I'm 100% right to say you're Hitler Youth.
[03:40:47.265 --> 03:40:50.146]  The left calls us Nazis all day when the shoe doesn't fit.
[03:40:50.326 --> 03:40:51.507]  That's what I'm saying!
[03:40:51.767 --> 03:40:52.968]  And then they banned me!
[03:40:52.988 --> 03:40:55.049]  It just pisses me off!
[03:40:56.504 --> 03:41:02.167]  Yeah, they take us off for speaking our opinions and our ideas.
[03:41:03.588 --> 03:41:05.669]  Is CNN calling for all of us to be banned?
[03:41:05.729 --> 03:41:06.810]  Is that not Nazi-like?
[03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:09.211]  It absolutely is!
[03:41:09.771 --> 03:41:14.054]  And if you're trying to... it is, like we've said, a digital book-burning.
[03:41:14.394 --> 03:41:25.462]  There's no difference when you take somebody's points of view, ideology, opinions, and say that these aren't fit for people to read or listen to or see.
[03:41:25.942 --> 03:41:30.145]  It becomes a book-burning for the new millennium, as they say.
[03:41:31.866 --> 03:41:32.987]  Why do they have no shame?
[03:41:33.387 --> 03:41:37.650]  He was so smug and laughing at me.
[03:41:38.771 --> 03:41:41.553]  I cannot call myself to call for him to be banned.
[03:41:42.113 --> 03:41:43.094]  Because he's no threat!
[03:41:44.235 --> 03:41:44.415]  No!
[03:41:44.515 --> 03:41:48.578]  And I've never asked for any person to be banned.
[03:41:49.038 --> 03:41:51.780]  Everybody has the right to put their opinion out there.
[03:41:51.820 --> 03:41:55.543]  Because you're ready to have the green light come on in the racetrack.
[03:41:56.423 --> 03:41:57.844]  But these guys, they don't want to do that.
[03:41:58.224 --> 03:41:58.825]  They are scared.
[03:41:59.634 --> 03:42:01.055]  No, they're petrified.
[03:42:01.935 --> 03:42:08.577]  I love when the opposing point of view is shown because it gives me something to debate, something to say.
[03:42:08.597 --> 03:42:09.357]  No, that's when I wake up!
[03:42:09.617 --> 03:42:10.058]  Exactly!
[03:42:10.078 --> 03:42:11.098]  We love debate!
[03:42:11.178 --> 03:42:13.039]  I beg them to come on, they won't come on!
[03:42:13.659 --> 03:42:14.999]  They will never come on.
[03:42:15.219 --> 03:42:16.320]  They are petrified.
[03:42:16.580 --> 03:42:24.283]  And they would rather silence any opposition because they know that people might go, huh, wow, that guy's got a valid point.
[03:42:25.803 --> 03:42:29.584]  Howard Stern or you would have on some toothless, retarded Nazi.
[03:42:30.164 --> 03:42:33.065]  And it's like super entertaining, and it's destroying him!
[03:42:33.325 --> 03:42:36.005]  They're not giving a Nazi a platform, he sounds like a moron!
[03:42:36.725 --> 03:42:38.366]  The light of day, Alex.
[03:42:38.426 --> 03:42:44.727]  When you shine the light of day on a lot of these ridiculous people, it exposes them.
[03:42:44.807 --> 03:42:46.028]  And that's the best thing!
[03:42:46.348 --> 03:42:52.049]  More best than telling someone that someone's a nut, is showing them the person being a nut!
[03:42:52.629 --> 03:42:55.217]  Anthony Cormier, he's with compoundmini.com.
[03:42:55.337 --> 03:42:56.741]  Final segment in the War Room.
[03:42:56.781 --> 03:42:58.004]  Straight ahead, spread these links.
[03:43:03.368 --> 03:43:08.291]  Survival Sylladex 2, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:43:08.431 --> 03:43:17.597]  But this is the pure 999999999 stuff, 4.9 stars on Power Reviews, 6,000 plus reviews, 98% reviews, it's an amazing product.
[03:43:17.798 --> 03:43:24.002]  We had a really good seaweed source, it was one of the top rated in the world five years ago, and the globalists doing economic sabotage.
[03:43:24.562 --> 03:43:26.604]  Reached out, found out where we're getting it, and blocked it.
[03:43:26.684 --> 03:43:29.085]  So then we found a source working with a big top U.S.
[03:43:29.145 --> 03:43:33.628]  lab that doesn't want to be named because they get harassed to get it from oil companies where it's 9999999 pure.
[03:43:33.829 --> 03:43:36.330]  You gotta have a DEA license to get it.
[03:43:36.350 --> 03:43:37.851]  You know, once it's put in the palm oil, it isn't.
[03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:38.732]  It's all patented.
[03:43:38.812 --> 03:43:43.576]  This has been our best seller, but the oil companies then figured out what was going on, so they doubled, they tripled prices.
[03:43:43.696 --> 03:43:44.576]  I'm not gonna sell this for $50.
[03:43:45.817 --> 03:43:47.639]  I'm not gonna pay twenty-something dollars for it.
[03:43:48.160 --> 03:43:49.841]  You know, I'm not gonna sit there and do that.
[03:43:49.982 --> 03:43:55.047]  So, I did a huge order at the old price, and then they still raised it, so I broke my contract.
[03:43:55.127 --> 03:43:55.748]  I said, that's it.
[03:43:55.848 --> 03:43:56.448]  No more extra two.
[03:43:56.508 --> 03:43:58.410]  And this is the best, purest iodine out there.
[03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:59.772]  Everybody sees the difference.
[03:43:59.812 --> 03:44:01.013]  The others are bound to stuff.
[03:44:01.153 --> 03:44:01.934]  I wish there was other ones.
[03:44:01.994 --> 03:44:05.917]  We're working right now with some other petroleum exploring companies to try to have a new X2.
[03:44:05.957 --> 03:44:07.179]  This we'll call it X3.
[03:44:07.759 --> 03:44:10.601]  And we may be close, but this is the last run of X2.
[03:44:10.621 --> 03:44:12.203]  So I've broken the contract.
[03:44:12.363 --> 03:44:12.883]  This is it.
[03:44:13.344 --> 03:44:14.705]  X2, it's amazing.
[03:44:14.785 --> 03:44:16.186]  This stuff changed my life.
[03:44:16.226 --> 03:44:19.369]  Now talk to your physician, because if you've already got pre-existing issues, who knows?
[03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:21.391]  But iodine is life-giving.
[03:44:21.451 --> 03:44:22.612]  This is the end of X2.
[03:44:22.752 --> 03:44:24.514]  And I hope and pray to God we get something better.
[03:44:24.554 --> 03:44:26.095]  People say, well, why are you 25% off?
[03:44:26.195 --> 03:44:27.896]  I always discount products.
[03:44:28.057 --> 03:44:28.997]  We normally discount at 25%.
[03:44:29.818 --> 03:44:30.118]  Okay.
[03:44:30.258 --> 03:44:33.760]  And so, until we get down to a few thousand bottles, it's going to be there.
[03:44:33.820 --> 03:44:36.322]  And then it's going to go to the full price in the last few thousand bottles.
[03:44:36.382 --> 03:44:38.283]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:44:38.583 --> 03:44:39.944]  And then you know you're getting a great product.
[03:44:40.024 --> 03:44:40.564]  Just experience.
[03:44:40.584 --> 03:44:41.224]  It takes a few weeks.
[03:44:41.264 --> 03:44:46.407]  Now, when I first started taking it five years ago, before we even sold it, when we had patents, it was the newest thing.
[03:44:46.848 --> 03:44:47.648]  Folks said, I don't know, about
[03:44:47.708 --> 03:44:50.550]  Two, three weeks in, you're gonna feel really toxic and bad.
[03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:52.172]  And stuff's gonna come out of your skin.
[03:44:52.192 --> 03:44:52.892]  It all happened.
[03:44:53.012 --> 03:44:54.533]  But it was disgusting.
[03:44:54.674 --> 03:44:56.375]  I mean, all this stuff came out of my skin.
[03:44:56.515 --> 03:44:59.217]  All these things happened because this is what powers the whole body.
[03:44:59.277 --> 03:45:01.199]  And this is pure, so it goes right into your blood.
[03:45:01.259 --> 03:45:04.061]  I mean, the stuff we have so pure, it turns into gas above 90 degrees.
[03:45:04.241 --> 03:45:06.543]  Right there, like, I Dream of Jeannie if you're watching Purple Gas.
[03:45:07.404 --> 03:45:08.845]  And that's not, again, a fiction movie.
[03:45:08.865 --> 03:45:09.626]  That's happening.
[03:45:09.666 --> 03:45:10.386]  That's how pure it is.
[03:45:10.426 --> 03:45:11.207]  Nobody else has got this.
[03:45:11.267 --> 03:45:12.488]  And this is the last.
[03:45:12.868 --> 03:45:14.009]  We may be able to get another source.
[03:45:14.049 --> 03:45:14.910]  We're working on it right now.
[03:45:15.270 --> 03:45:22.859]  But if you want X2, our best-selling, amazing product that blows every other so-called iodine away, it's available 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:23.039 --> 03:45:25.341]  But this is the final run of X2.
[03:45:25.381 --> 03:45:27.444]  If you want it, get it, and it supports a broadcast.
[03:45:27.644 --> 03:45:29.786]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:29.806 --> 03:45:30.107]  Stay with us.
[03:45:31.610 --> 03:45:38.495]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[03:45:38.755 --> 03:45:48.481]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[03:45:48.541 --> 03:45:51.543]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[03:45:51.784 --> 03:45:53.004]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[03:45:53.425 --> 03:46:00.890]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:46:01.650 --> 03:46:04.831]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:46:05.291 --> 03:46:06.591]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:46:07.092 --> 03:46:18.515]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:46:19.315 --> 03:46:28.222]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:46:28.522 --> 03:46:39.330]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:46:39.850 --> 03:46:42.171]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:46:42.511 --> 03:46:43.831]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:46:44.251 --> 03:46:53.853]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:46:53.954 --> 03:46:56.114]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:46:56.654 --> 03:47:01.535]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[03:47:05.056 --> 03:47:07.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.881 --> 03:47:23.429]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.930 --> 03:47:27.214]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:47:29.810 --> 03:47:31.872]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:47:32.032 --> 03:47:32.393]  Retail $39.95.
[03:47:33.294 --> 03:47:33.794]  Sale price $19.95.
[03:47:33.834 --> 03:47:36.257]  50% off.
[03:47:36.497 --> 03:47:41.262]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[03:47:41.442 --> 03:47:45.326]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[03:47:45.546 --> 03:47:46.427]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[03:47:46.467 --> 03:47:47.207]  Our previous supplier
[03:47:50.547 --> 03:47:57.250]  Uh, was unable to get the incredible ingredients that we need to create this formula while keeping the cost low.
[03:47:57.610 --> 03:48:03.592]  Since we wanted to make sure that you got the best value possible, we've now switched to a new supplier with even better ingredients.
[03:48:04.072 --> 03:48:06.413]  That's why it's now the ultimate bone broth formula.
[03:48:06.653 --> 03:48:14.776]  The incredible ingredients included in the ultimate bone broth formula include chicken bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom,
[03:48:15.496 --> 03:48:19.918]  Bee pollen, goji berry, and alfalfa herb powder.
[03:48:20.298 --> 03:48:21.399]  And even more, of course.
[03:48:21.819 --> 03:48:32.344]  These powerful ingredients are going to help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.
[03:48:33.344 --> 03:48:41.868]  It's time to take advantage of these savings and pick up your bottle of an updated favorite formula with Ultimate Bone Broth from InfoWars Life.
[03:48:42.369 --> 03:48:42.809]  Thank you!
[03:48:44.823 --> 03:48:46.185]  My God, man!
[03:48:46.885 --> 03:48:50.248]  I am... I'm outraged.
[03:48:50.328 --> 03:48:51.429]  I sound like Reverend Al.
[03:48:51.890 --> 03:48:52.991]  I'm outraged!
[03:48:53.111 --> 03:48:54.292]  Every day, I'm outraged.
[03:48:55.293 --> 03:48:58.376]  Of course, we've talked about being booted off of social media.
[03:48:58.896 --> 03:48:59.997]  Alex has been booted off.
[03:49:00.097 --> 03:49:00.878]  I've been booted off.
[03:49:01.318 --> 03:49:02.539]  Just for speaking our mind.
[03:49:03.100 --> 03:49:08.084]  Just for speaking our mind in plain, open, fearless English.
[03:49:11.148 --> 03:49:25.371]  The fact that some of these companies have such power over what people hear, see, read, listen to, it's amazing to me that some people are fine with this.
[03:49:25.952 --> 03:49:26.732]  I hear it all the time.
[03:49:27.152 --> 03:49:27.912]  Freedom of speech.
[03:49:29.292 --> 03:49:30.213]  Oh, they're censoring.
[03:49:30.293 --> 03:49:31.353]  And then you'll always get this.
[03:49:33.090 --> 03:49:40.393]  The freedom of speech is the government can infringe on your freedom, but a private company can do whatever they want.
[03:49:41.034 --> 03:49:43.255]  There's consequences to... Shut up!
[03:49:44.355 --> 03:49:44.975]  Shut up!
[03:49:45.075 --> 03:49:46.316]  Are you fine with that?
[03:49:46.336 --> 03:49:53.299]  I don't care what your interpretation of what freedom of speech is as an American.
[03:49:54.563 --> 03:50:07.753]  But mine certainly isn't a handful of companies deciding what everyone sees and hears or doesn't see and hear because of their own agendas and political ideology.
[03:50:09.033 --> 03:50:11.515]  So something, yes, something has to be done.
[03:50:11.876 --> 03:50:21.883]  We can't just throw people off of what has turned into the public forum, the town square, the public room.
[03:50:23.122 --> 03:50:25.143]  Uh, but that's exactly what they're doing.
[03:50:25.583 --> 03:50:30.644]  And I believe things like this really point out that there's an issue here.
[03:50:31.144 --> 03:50:37.446]  A valid issue that they are infringing on people's freedom of speech and, uh, endangering people.
[03:50:38.246 --> 03:50:39.487]  I've been kicked off of Twitter.
[03:50:40.507 --> 03:50:41.927]  And, uh, what does that mean?
[03:50:42.027 --> 03:50:44.648]  I can't get things like this from FEMA?
[03:50:45.488 --> 03:50:46.509]  FEMA's on Twitter.
[03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:51.330]  There's a hurricane spinning out of control up the, uh, Carolinas.
[03:50:52.706 --> 03:51:03.051]  And FEMA tweets things like, if you're in a mandatory evacuation zone for Florence, your window of time to leave is closing rapidly.
[03:51:03.551 --> 03:51:06.192]  Here are the zones for South Carolina.
[03:51:06.532 --> 03:51:10.474]  And they show a little map here you can click on.
[03:51:10.614 --> 03:51:13.435]  Oh, if, if you're on Twitter.
[03:51:14.019 --> 03:51:14.620]  You can do that.
[03:51:15.100 --> 03:51:35.718]  So I am not, because I have said things that some corporate people at Twitter don't agree with, I'm not entitled to get safety news from a medium, a platform, that has become a public forum for world leaders, government agencies,
[03:51:36.573 --> 03:51:39.475]  That dole out safety information?
[03:51:40.115 --> 03:51:45.638]  If there's a school shooting, a lot of times Twitter will put where to go, what to do?
[03:51:46.458 --> 03:51:46.699]  No?
[03:51:46.959 --> 03:51:47.619]  I don't get that?
[03:51:48.079 --> 03:51:49.140]  Because I was a bad boy?
[03:51:50.467 --> 03:51:52.849]  What about the National Hurricane Center?
[03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:54.390]  What about their Twitter?
[03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:55.271]  They have one.
[03:51:55.891 --> 03:51:56.331]  I don't.
[03:51:57.072 --> 03:51:57.412]  So what?
[03:51:57.532 --> 03:52:10.622]  I can't subscribe to these things and follow them on a Twitter account so I can get instant, up-to-date news on a life-threatening situation because I said something someone doesn't like?
[03:52:11.474 --> 03:52:15.555]  Do not focus on the wind speed category of Hurricane Florence.
[03:52:15.835 --> 03:52:23.176]  Life-threatening storm surge flooding, catastrophic flash flooding, and prolonged significant river flooding are still expected.
[03:52:23.556 --> 03:52:23.876]  More.
[03:52:23.936 --> 03:52:25.016]  Here's the storm surge.
[03:52:25.296 --> 03:52:26.057]  Here's the map.
[03:52:26.517 --> 03:52:28.457]  Here's me not being able to click on it.
[03:52:29.137 --> 03:52:29.657]  Or see it.
[03:52:30.177 --> 03:52:35.218]  Because I said something naughty, perhaps.
[03:52:35.998 --> 03:52:40.039]  But this is a valid argument.
[03:52:41.207 --> 03:52:46.249]  To the idea that they should not have this kind of power over people.
[03:52:46.749 --> 03:53:04.635]  I'm being penalized and perhaps other people are being penalized and their safety is now being jeopardized because they are not entitled to this National Hurricane Center statement or this FEMA statement that they could get on Twitter.
[03:53:04.935 --> 03:53:08.696]  Yeah, look, obviously you can go other places and get it.
[03:53:09.611 --> 03:53:21.862]  But it's not the same thing as it popping up on something you follow, the National Hurricane Center or FEMA, during an emergency like this, and then things pop up in your timeline.
[03:53:22.242 --> 03:53:23.763]  You don't have to go searching them out.
[03:53:24.564 --> 03:53:30.629]  This is a safety issue that certain people are being denied because of their political ideology.
[03:53:31.290 --> 03:53:33.392]  And I'd be hard-pressed
[03:53:34.272 --> 03:53:38.393]  To find someone that could legitimately argue that with me.
[03:53:38.913 --> 03:53:49.815]  Please argue that I'm not entitled, because of political ideology, to receive safety information from FEMA or the National Hurricane Center.
[03:53:50.375 --> 03:53:50.575]  No?
[03:53:51.236 --> 03:53:52.296]  You got a good argument for that?
[03:53:53.056 --> 03:53:57.437]  You got something where maybe you were offended by something I said, so perhaps I should perish in a hurricane?
[03:53:58.983 --> 03:54:03.228]  I might sound overdramatic, but if you're a liberal, you get that, because that's what you do.
[03:54:05.070 --> 03:54:12.477]  Another thing is, like I mentioned before, Louis Farrakhan and Ahmadinejad have verified accounts on Twitter.
[03:54:13.118 --> 03:54:13.859]  Verified accounts!
[03:54:13.939 --> 03:54:16.381]  Ahmadinejad, back in 1979-1980, was one of the mechanics of the hostage crisis
[03:54:21.895 --> 03:54:25.400]  In Iran, when Americans were taken hostage.
[03:54:26.381 --> 03:54:27.522]  And he's a good guy.
[03:54:27.883 --> 03:54:34.351]  He's good enough that Twitter says, alright, but this Alex Jones and Anthony Comea, they're horrible people.
[03:54:35.706 --> 03:54:37.747]  And then we have, um, Hollywood.
[03:54:37.787 --> 03:54:40.728]  You know I usually finish with a little, Hollywood!
[03:54:40.748 --> 03:54:43.009]  Da da da da da da da!
[03:54:43.709 --> 03:54:44.830]  Hollywood!
[03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:46.330]  Cause they're, uh, mental patients.
[03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:49.271]  They're mental patients in Hollywood.
[03:54:49.772 --> 03:54:53.713]  Norm Macdonald was, uh, oh what a horrible human being he is.
[03:54:54.253 --> 03:54:55.414]  He's hilariously funny.
[03:54:56.187 --> 03:55:00.970]  He's got such a quick wit and no fear, which is amazing.
[03:55:00.990 --> 03:55:02.151]  That's great for a comic.
[03:55:02.391 --> 03:55:04.052]  That used to be looked up to in comedians.
[03:55:04.432 --> 03:55:09.895]  Now he's apologizing and now they got him apologizing for an apology.
[03:55:10.456 --> 03:55:12.417]  So Norm Macdonald had the audacity
[03:55:13.866 --> 03:55:16.529]  To say that the Me Too movement has slowed down.
[03:55:16.589 --> 03:55:17.430]  He's happy with that.
[03:55:17.991 --> 03:55:20.453]  It used to be 100 women can't be lying.
[03:55:20.914 --> 03:55:23.216]  And then it became one woman can't be lying.
[03:55:23.596 --> 03:55:26.099]  And then it became I believe all women.
[03:55:26.580 --> 03:55:27.701]  And when you're like, what?
[03:55:28.201 --> 03:55:29.783]  Like that Chris Hardwick guy.
[03:55:30.103 --> 03:55:32.686]  I really thought he got the blunt end of the stick there.
[03:55:33.407 --> 03:55:34.108]  He's right!
[03:55:35.111 --> 03:55:47.625]  We can't look at people, even people like Les Moonves, where allegations have come in of sexual harassment over the course of his tenure, before his tenure as head of CBS television.
[03:55:48.806 --> 03:55:51.509]  Yeah, this stuff was like before he was even with CBS.
[03:55:52.690 --> 03:55:57.255]  You can't look at that and then, like Judd Apatow says, put him in prison.
[03:55:57.890 --> 03:55:59.672]  Judd Apatow's an idiot.
[03:56:00.372 --> 03:56:06.018]  He's saying Les Moonves should be put in prison and his money should be taken away and given to charity.
[03:56:06.518 --> 03:56:08.400]  I guess I missed the trial?
[03:56:08.740 --> 03:56:09.281]  Where was I?
[03:56:09.881 --> 03:56:12.223]  Where was I during the trial of Les Moonves?
[03:56:12.664 --> 03:56:22.533]  Where he was found guilty and a jury of his peers and the judge decided he should go to prison and lose all of his money because
[03:56:23.377 --> 03:56:25.039]  Accusers said something.
[03:56:25.560 --> 03:56:28.523]  Men have got to fight back.
[03:56:29.324 --> 03:56:44.701]  This has gotten to the point where a woman that's being vindictive, perhaps she was a scorned lover, perhaps she didn't get that promotion she thought she deserved, but in the normal course of the corporate environment, she didn't get it.
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:59.009]  And now this in-case-of-emergency-break-glass thing is put in front of every woman now, where they could just hit it, make an accusation, and they're right.
[03:56:59.889 --> 03:57:00.570]  They're right.
[03:57:00.730 --> 03:57:02.951]  They're the ones that were harassed.
[03:57:03.311 --> 03:57:07.394]  They're the ones that deserve money and a better position.
[03:57:08.106 --> 03:57:16.779]  Now of course I don't have to sit here and explain that people that were legitimately harassed have the right to justice and perhaps some kind of compensation.
[03:57:17.039 --> 03:57:22.868]  But you can't just believe anybody and everybody because that's what people say!
[03:57:24.583 --> 03:57:25.463]  It's ludicrous.
[03:57:25.643 --> 03:57:26.304]  Ridiculous.
[03:57:26.844 --> 03:57:29.824]  Next week I will be back on here hosting InfoWars.
[03:57:30.125 --> 03:57:32.285]  Until then, see me at Compound Media.

[03:57:40.167 --> 03:57:40.827]  Check that out.
[03:57:41.607 --> 03:57:42.727]  Compoundmedia.com.
[03:57:42.747 --> 03:57:44.068]  My show starts in minutes.
[03:57:44.768 --> 03:57:45.288]  4 p.m.
[03:57:45.468 --> 03:57:47.589]  Eastern Time on Compound Media.
[03:57:47.629 --> 03:57:49.849]  Thank you everyone at InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[03:57:49.889 --> 03:57:51.850]  I'll see you next time.
[03:57:51.870 --> 03:57:53.030]  You are confident.
[03:57:57.977 --> 03:57:58.917]  You are unique.
[03:58:02.538 --> 03:58:04.138]  You are inspiring.
[03:58:06.999 --> 03:58:09.660]  And today, you will look your beautiful best.
[03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:13.180]  Instantly Ageless.
[03:58:13.781 --> 03:58:19.322]  An age-defying microcream that in less than two minutes restores the youthful appearance of your skin.
[03:58:20.899 --> 03:58:26.602]  Created to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, pores, and puffiness under the eyes.
[03:58:27.943 --> 03:58:28.483]  No needles.
[03:58:29.124 --> 03:58:29.664]  No pain.
[03:58:30.464 --> 03:58:32.746]  Just a happier, younger-looking you.
[03:58:33.926 --> 03:58:36.027]  To use, simply massage the packet.
[03:58:36.928 --> 03:58:40.410]  Dispense a small drop and lightly pat a thin layer to targeted areas.
[03:58:41.460 --> 03:58:45.742]  Leave the product damp on your skin and remain expressionless for two minutes while it dries.
[03:58:46.523 --> 03:58:48.964]  And, if you missed a spot, it's easy to reapply.
[03:58:48.984 --> 03:58:53.927]  Or, if you happen to apply too much, wet a cotton swab and gently remove any residue.
[03:58:54.567 --> 03:58:57.649]  Apply oil-free cosmetics and finish getting ready as usual.
[03:58:58.089 --> 03:58:58.910]  It's that simple.
