[00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.712]  You have the power.
[00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:06.713]  Humanity has the power.
[00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:07.814]  We have the power.
[00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:09.135]  Do you want to fight?
[00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:13.558]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:18.581]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.022]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.948]  Well, if you want next year's news today, you have found the place, Infowars.com.
[00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:43.218]  If you go back to January 20th, 2017, myself and Roger Stone were live at the inauguration.
[00:00:44.349 --> 00:01:04.116]  On the street and in a studio saying over and over again, Trump must launch a DOJ criminal investigation of illegal spying by the Obama campaign and by the Hillary campaign against President Trump.
[00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:12.619]  He said it over and over again, that illegal spying by the Hillary campaign through Obama's DOJ, NSA, CIA.
[00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:27.374]  And they even had, that very day, people like Chuck Schumer going, the intelligence community has seven ways from Sunday to get you.
[00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:29.556]  And we're going to punish you and we're coming for you.
[00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:39.283]  And remember, Brennan famously said, two days before the inauguration, to President Trump, you better watch your mouth.
[00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:43.246]  I mean, these are some of the most arrogant people
[00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:50.806]  That the world has ever seen.
[00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:58.833]  They are absolutely, totally, and completely arrogant and insane and out of their minds.
[00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:14.606]  And I'm gonna recap all of it and roll through all of it, but the reason the media hates us, and the reason the globalists have us targeted, number one, after Trump, is they tune in and they hear what they know is really going on, and they say, how on earth
[00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:19.104]  Do these people know all this?
[00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.285]  Well, we know how you guys operate.
[00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:23.926]  We know your history.
[00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:24.846]  We know your M.O.
[00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:30.168]  We know you're very robotic about how you repeat the same things over and over again.
[00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:32.269]  And you guys are very badly disciplined.
[00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:47.911]  You go on print media, you go on TV media, you go on radio and you blabber about what you're going to do to everybody and then later you think we have no memory and you say you never did it.
[00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:53.935]  So we knew you were illegally spying on Trump because that's what you do.
[00:02:53.935 --> 00:03:00.239]  You're a bunch of crooks and you were continually having pieces of information that weren't leaked.
[00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.081]  They were being gleaned from wiretaps.
[00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:10.026]  They were being gleaned by electronic surveillance and Trump knew that during the campaign.
[00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:12.247]  Trump knew that when he was president-elect.
[00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:24.930]  Trump had a consortium of paramilitary organizations and groups counter-surveilling all of you when you were spying on him.
[00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.771]  And man, did he set you up.
[00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:38.395]  He set you up so bad when you committed all those crimes, and you perjured yourself to Congress, and you lied to everybody in the media.
[00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.977]  And that's why I want to cue this up first, and I've already played it twice.
[00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:43.499]  That's what Giuliani said on Fox News last week.
[00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:47.242]  He said, we're ready to tear you apart.
[00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:48.623]  You want to end this peacefully?
[00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:51.725]  Go ahead and stop now, for the betterment of the country.
[00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:55.568]  But if you want us to tear you apart, we're going to tear you apart.
[00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.329]  That's not a threat.
[00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.771]  That's called an ultimatum.
[00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.111]  Here it is.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.780]  They should do it today.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.123]  I mean, as soon as possible.
[00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:07.125]  I think that they have the facts from which they can write their report.
[00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.146]  If you're going to write a fair report, fine, write it.
[00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:11.988]  If you're going to write an unfair report, write it.
[00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:13.209]  And we will combat it.
[00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.410]  We're ready to rip it apart.
[00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.972]  And we're ready to rip them apart, if that's what they want.
[00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:23.675]  We would rather peacefully settle this and get it over with.
[00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:25.537]  Rudy Giuliani, always great to see you.
[00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:26.017]  Thanks for coming.
[00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:30.374]  It's really, really bad, folks.
[00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:31.855]  When we come back, I'm going to get into all of it.
[00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.775]  There's so much other news.
[00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:35.896]  The election in Venezuela of the dictator.
[00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.436]  If you believe that's a real election, I've got a bridge I'll sell you.
[00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.437]  Their whole illegal spy network coming down.
[00:04:40.437 --> 00:04:42.837]  What's happening over in Hawaii.
[00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:43.918]  I meant to get to this Friday.
[00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:45.758]  Fox News covered it last night.
[00:04:45.758 --> 00:04:50.539]  NAACP leader said racially profiled.
[00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:51.780]  But then the body cams released.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.080]  The police officer's totally polite.
[00:04:54.322 --> 00:04:55.503]  Well, the NAACP leader went further.
[00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.025]  He made up a bunch of lies.
[00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.548]  We're going to cover all that coming up as well.
[00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:02.890]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:08.446]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:11.062 --> 00:06:22.585]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:30.767]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.952]  Well, it's official.
[00:06:42.952 --> 00:07:02.731]  The DOJ has confirmed that the Inspector General is probing in a criminal investigation the Obama administration, the Hillary campaign, the head of the National Office of Security, the head of the CIA,
[00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:30.980]  The Director of National Intelligence, all of them are being criminally probed for the illegal spying on the Trump campaign, when the President was just a candidate, when he was a nominee, when he was the President-elect, and they kept doing it even after he was President, with their stay-behind networks inside the 17 agencies.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.240]  And they also
[00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:48.551]  Had human intelligence on the ground, not just the professor we exposed five days before anybody else, Halperin, but others.
[00:07:48.551 --> 00:08:01.936]  Going in and bringing up Russians and Russian influence at all these different public events when President Trump was a candidate, the nominee, president-elect, and then president.
[00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:16.772]  And over and over again, it comes out in all these meetings, they were rebuffed on being approached by the so-called Russian state, or by people that claimed that they wanted to talk to them about the Russians.
[00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.694]  They followed everything by the book.
[00:08:19.694 --> 00:08:31.064]  So then they took the President-elect's National Security Advisor, who it's customary on January 20th, right after the President's sworn in, is handed the football,
[00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:33.756]  That's what you do.
[00:08:33.756 --> 00:08:39.057]  You reach out to Russia and China and Britain and Germany and Mexico and Canada and Australia and Japan.
[00:08:39.057 --> 00:08:40.618]  That's what you do default.
[00:08:59.454 --> 00:09:12.860]  And the media turned all that into a circus and tried to get Flynn to give a false statement to the FBI about something, even though there's nothing illegal there, but just trip him up and make him make a mistake.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:21.224]  And so they ended up getting him, folks, with threats of not having his paperwork filled out on Turkey lobbying.
[00:09:21.224 --> 00:09:22.705]  That's really why Flynn just pled guilty.
[00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:24.145]  He said, fine, I'm not going to defend any of this.
[00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:25.366]  I haven't done anything wrong.
[00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:26.786]  You want to put me in prison for something?
[00:09:26.786 --> 00:09:27.787]  Just make it up and do it.
[00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:31.314]  That's what happened.
[00:09:31.314 --> 00:09:37.200]  In the four years since he was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he did lobbying.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.521]  He went out and was a consultant.
[00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.904]  That's what retired generals do.
[00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:51.212]  And they went, oh, you might not have filled out an exact lobbying form right on this new regulation that came up in 2016.
[00:09:51.212 --> 00:09:55.496]  And he went, okay, no one's ever been charged with it.
[00:09:55.496 --> 00:09:56.817]  You don't even get fines for it.
[00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.031]  That's the type of stuff they've got on Flynn.
[00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:27.868]  So, if you go to CNN, it's just all these crazy articles about how dare President Trump meanly call for a criminal investigation of Obama, and then now the Justice Department announced today that indeed it's a criminal investigation, and the mainstream corporate media has now gone into convulsions of fear.
[00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:28.629]  Because here's the deal.
[00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:41.527]  Clapper, the very arrogant criminal that told Congress twice under oath that the NSA spies on no one in the U.S.
[00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:44.409]  ever.
[00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:50.933]  Turns out Obama was already spying on Trump five years ago when Clapper made that statement.
[00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:52.134]  Trump was under full surveillance.
[00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:53.995]  This has all come out in the FISA Court.
[00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:59.439]  And the FISA Court's put out an emergency report last year to the president that's public that we covered.
[00:11:01.943 --> 00:11:06.607]  Remember Nunes called it the FISA memo and then he put out his report based on that?
[00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:26.423]  And the FISA memo lays out three instances where they illegally lied to get fake warrants to cover previous criminal investigations that were going on without warrants illegally.
[00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:27.704]  It's called parallel construction.
[00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:38.679]  Why do you think Mueller's subpoenaing now eight different Trump associates just last week and grabbing them off the street and interrogating them and then demanding all their emails and correspondence?
[00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:42.761]  They already have it from the Senate committee that investigated Stone.
[00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:49.043]  They already have it from the House committee, but they're having to parallel construct it because they already illegally have it.
[00:11:50.441 --> 00:11:57.323]  That's all been confirmed, so they have to now act like they got it from somebody else to try to use that in court against Stone.
[00:11:57.323 --> 00:12:05.745]  Even though there's nothing illegal there, they just want to try to find something that doesn't 100% match up.
[00:12:05.745 --> 00:12:18.989]  So, that is the point that we have gotten to in this country, where there is a criminal investigation that has been opened up
[00:12:20.154 --> 00:12:38.299]  Rightfully so, by the Office of the Inspector General, not under the control of the President of the country, Rosenstein, and his deputy, the most dangerous man in America, the rogue Attorney General, who is completely compromised and involved in a dereliction of duty.
[00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:48.882]  But the Inspector General is doing his job and following the President's directive, and has now launched a criminal investigation of Obama and of the Hillary campaign,
[00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:51.363]  And we already have them.
[00:12:51.363 --> 00:13:02.107]  We already have Obama to the New York Times on January 8th, 9th, and 10th of 2017 saying, don't worry, we're going to bring Trump down.
[00:13:02.107 --> 00:13:03.768]  We've got the data.
[00:13:03.768 --> 00:13:06.509]  We've been monitoring him and his campaign.
[00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:08.289]  We know they did wrong.
[00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:12.250]  We know they're in bed with the Russians and others, and we're going to bring Trump down.
[00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.172]  That was put in the New York Times to go, look, the president, still sitting.
[00:13:17.268 --> 00:13:20.429]  Says, Trump's a criminal, he's a Russian.
[00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:28.733]  So that people in the CIA, the FBI, the NSA would go, okay, we'll keep spying on him, we'll stay where we are, we'll refuse his orders.
[00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:33.655]  And they came to him, this was even in the news, and said, do not follow the President's orders if he gets in.
[00:13:33.655 --> 00:13:35.516]  He'll be gone within a few months.
[00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:37.437]  Then a few months passed, he wasn't gone.
[00:13:37.437 --> 00:13:44.540]  Then Brennan and Clapper go on CNN and say, he will be gone by November, guaranteed.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.061]  And then Wolf Blitzer goes, you mean impeachment?
[00:13:46.932 --> 00:13:50.395]  They said, no, extrajudicially.
[00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:58.141]  And Blitzer goes, wow, because this is the former head of the CIA and former head of national intelligence.
[00:13:58.141 --> 00:14:02.185]  And so they know this is speaking for the shadow government that Obama and John McCain were heading up.
[00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:05.212]  And so he took it like, wow, this is amazing.
[00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:07.113]  Just hold on, hold on to your places.
[00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:08.454]  We're going to beat them.
[00:14:08.454 --> 00:14:09.275]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:14:09.275 --> 00:14:10.435]  Everything's PR.
[00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:27.506]  Suing Trump, suing me, saying Trump's a liar, saying the economy's falling apart, saying all of this, saying that mainstream media's winning is meant to make their people hold on in an impossible situation while they try to dig something up to remove Trump.
[00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:28.947]  But then they came up empty handed.
[00:14:28.947 --> 00:14:32.189]  So they are now in one trillion percent panic mode.
[00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:38.613]  And when Trump keeps saying this is bigger than Watergate, it's true.
[00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:47.175]  That's why Clapper, famous perjurer, is saying that Trump's tweets are disturbing assault on Justice Department's independence.
[00:14:47.175 --> 00:14:50.837]  The Justice Department is under the executive and the president.
[00:14:50.837 --> 00:14:55.338]  The Justice Department has become rogue to the globalists.
[00:14:58.442 --> 00:15:27.228]  The Justice Department is running around with only a few people, Clinton and Obama stay-behinds, that are acting outside of their authority, and have the mainstream media saying it'll be this giant faux pas, this giant era of justice, this mafia criminal activity, if Trump does anything to these people who are completely rogue, raiding his lawyer, leaking everything to the media, telling all these lies, going on TV saying the President better watch his mouth,
[00:15:28.732 --> 00:15:33.079]  But you can see the megalomania is draining out of their faces.
[00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:35.143]  They're now white as ghosts.
[00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:37.827]  They're now white as a sheet.
[00:15:37.827 --> 00:15:41.614]  As all of their criminal activity and the fact that Trump knew even
[00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:57.501]  During the campaign, when he wasn't doing illegal spying, he was doing counter-surveillance, legal surveillance of his communications and his systems, and they knew they were being followed, tracked, watched, and attempted infiltrating.
[00:15:57.501 --> 00:15:58.582]  You've been set up, Obama!
[00:15:59.755 --> 00:16:00.555]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.555 --> 00:16:02.375]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.016]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:06.836]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.

[00:20:03.283 --> 00:20:05.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:42.221]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:46.344]  A lot has gone on in the last year and a half since President Trump got into office.
[00:20:50.017 --> 00:21:08.554]  When Trump talks about this being a scandal bigger than Watergate, a second-rate failed burglary spying on the psychiatrist of the Democrat nominee that Nixon was never even proven to have been running brought him down.
[00:21:08.554 --> 00:21:09.495]  On the case of
[00:21:10.762 --> 00:21:13.664]  This whole Russiagate situation.
[00:21:13.664 --> 00:21:21.570]  Obama was illegally spying on Trump and Hillary was illegal spying on Trump throughout the campaign.
[00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:27.835]  Trump was under NSA surveillance since 2010.
[00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:30.737]  The FBI is now admitting all of this.
[00:21:30.737 --> 00:21:32.018]  So that's the big takeaway.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:22:02.750]  Quantifying this, the FBI is now confirming there was illegal spying, monitoring, whatever you want to call it, the old terms wiretapping, but also physical infiltration, physical spying to track what the Trump campaign was doing, and to know what their next move would be politically, and they use the Russia investigation as the smokescreen for the major criminal political meddling
[00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:10.254]  That dwarfs anything we've ever seen in a fascist country or a third world banana republic.
[00:22:10.254 --> 00:22:21.343]  And that's the big takeaway here, that Obama and Hillary and all the... Clapper and Brennan were so arrogant, they thought they'd spy on him illegally and beat him.
[00:22:21.343 --> 00:22:23.085]  Then when they failed, they panicked.
[00:22:24.963 --> 00:22:32.146]  So they went public with their fake Russia investigation and hoped to find something that the public would buy.
[00:22:32.146 --> 00:22:41.030]  They came up empty-handed and the whole time Trump knew what was going on and was giving them rope when they testified before Congress.
[00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:48.253]  Mueller, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, Hayden.
[00:22:48.253 --> 00:22:50.934]  They are in deep, deep trouble and so now
[00:22:52.756 --> 00:23:04.065]  The FBI, the Justice Department are like, okay, there was an operation going back into the early days of the campaign, Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
[00:23:04.065 --> 00:23:12.311]  And they're saying national security, you cannot release it to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, who have the highest security clearances.
[00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:17.395]  They're saying Rosenstein and all the rest of these people are saying,
[00:23:18.493 --> 00:23:19.414]  Do.
[00:23:19.414 --> 00:23:20.214]  Not.
[00:23:20.214 --> 00:23:21.115]  Give.
[00:23:21.115 --> 00:23:21.875]  This.
[00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:22.636]  To.
[00:23:22.636 --> 00:23:23.176]  Congress.
[00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:26.779]  And so Trump says, checkmate!
[00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:30.862]  The President is the final arbiter of what is classified and what isn't.
[00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:37.747]  Under the Constitution, the President can go meet with the Russians, the Chinese, anybody, and give them the launch codes.
[00:23:37.747 --> 00:23:42.751]  Now, it'd be up to Congress to impeach him over that, but the point is, they've got the power to at least execute that.
[00:23:42.751 --> 00:23:44.632]  That's how Obama sold us out to foreign powers.
[00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:45.593]  That's how he opened the borders.
[00:23:48.772 --> 00:23:52.153]  So we first reported on Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
[00:23:52.153 --> 00:23:56.014]  We first reported on Professor Halperin, Stefan Halperin.
[00:23:56.014 --> 00:23:58.475]  We first reported on all of it.
[00:23:58.475 --> 00:24:02.516]  We first reported on eight Trump associates grabbed last week.
[00:24:02.516 --> 00:24:12.119]  You won't hear about it for days, because the media is so dutiful, they've got to wait till they hear from John Podesta and Hillary and Mueller, who are so in charge of the media.
[00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:17.081]  And when they decide what to do, you will then hear the new talking point.
[00:24:17.895 --> 00:24:19.735]  There's no filter here, folks.
[00:24:19.735 --> 00:24:20.856]  There's no filter here.
[00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:24.296]  By the way, Roger Stone talked to a high-level economist in the White House.
[00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:36.358]  I'm sure a lot of you can guess, a high-level economist that Roger was very supportive of for the new job of the economic head, economic czar.
[00:24:36.358 --> 00:24:41.940]  And guess, ladies and gentlemen, what an individual told Roger last week.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.240]  When the new quarterly numbers come out,
[00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:55.779]  Right now, it's estimated to be at 4 to 4.1.
[00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:58.440]  What are the Democrats going to do when that comes out?
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:05.581]  They are going to crap their collective big boy pants.
[00:25:05.581 --> 00:25:07.862]  You can feel the tide turn, folks.
[00:25:07.862 --> 00:25:09.862]  It's turned.
[00:25:09.862 --> 00:25:10.602]  Trump's winning.
[00:25:10.602 --> 00:25:11.423]  America's winning.
[00:25:11.423 --> 00:25:11.983]  We're winning.
[00:25:11.983 --> 00:25:14.703]  Here's the problem.
[00:25:14.703 --> 00:25:17.244]  For those of us on the front lines, like myself,
[00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:20.654]  They are coming for us.
[00:25:20.654 --> 00:25:22.835]  But it's a necessary sacrifice.
[00:25:22.835 --> 00:25:24.455]  Pawn sacrifice is what it's all about.
[00:25:24.455 --> 00:25:26.516]  It's called a gambit.
[00:25:26.516 --> 00:25:27.877]  It's called stratagem.
[00:25:27.877 --> 00:25:29.377]  It's called victory.
[00:25:29.377 --> 00:25:32.298]  And I believe InfoWars will make it through this even stronger.
[00:25:32.298 --> 00:25:34.699]  But know this.
[00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:37.300]  It's the path I've chosen.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.921]  And so I'm a winner one way or the other.
[00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:39.581]  I want that clear.
[00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:47.082]  They're not taking my victory away from me if they kill me, or set me up, or put me in prison, or bankrupt us, or whatever, and then going, oh look, we beat him.
[00:25:47.082 --> 00:25:48.082]  No!
[00:25:48.082 --> 00:25:50.203]  I'm taking you down!
[00:25:50.203 --> 00:25:53.405]  I have chosen this kamikaze attack.
[00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:54.706]  So let's get that straight, globalist.
[00:25:57.264 --> 00:25:58.725]  These people are such sociopaths though.
[00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:00.447]  They're so self-centered.
[00:26:00.447 --> 00:26:01.748]  They think I'm like them.
[00:26:01.748 --> 00:26:03.469]  I'll never be like you.
[00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:04.570]  I'm about destiny.
[00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.291]  I'm about changing the world.
[00:26:06.291 --> 00:26:09.734]  I'm about my life really meaning something for good.
[00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:12.396]  That's the value.
[00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:14.918]  That's what I want.
[00:26:14.918 --> 00:26:17.080]  So, why are we under attack?
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.262]  I've got to get more crew in here just to be archivist.
[00:26:19.262 --> 00:26:21.344]  We probably said, I'm not going to exaggerate,
[00:26:22.823 --> 00:26:33.352]  Let's be honest, 500 times that it was illegal spying, laid it all out, who did it, how they ran it, and that it was totally illegal, and it's all come out now exactly as we said.
[00:26:33.352 --> 00:26:36.234]  Roger Stone, myself, everybody else.
[00:26:36.234 --> 00:26:40.718]  Roger has personally told the President over and over and over and over and over again
[00:26:42.373 --> 00:26:43.473]  I've told him several times.
[00:26:43.473 --> 00:26:45.994]  Mr. President, they illegally spied on you during the campaign.
[00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:48.014]  They've been caught lying and perjuring themselves.
[00:26:48.014 --> 00:26:49.854]  Brennan has perjured himself.
[00:26:49.854 --> 00:26:52.035]  Clapper has done it before Congress.
[00:26:52.035 --> 00:26:53.435]  So has Comey.
[00:26:53.435 --> 00:26:55.236]  All of them have committed massive crimes.
[00:26:55.236 --> 00:26:56.896]  You've got to go after them.
[00:26:56.896 --> 00:26:58.196]  You've got to go after them.
[00:26:58.196 --> 00:27:00.397]  This is the key.
[00:27:00.397 --> 00:27:07.698]  Why do you think you then saw probably 10,000 news articles saying, we've got to keep Alex Jones away from the president?
[00:27:09.264 --> 00:27:10.745]  In fact, can we pull that up?
[00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:11.766]  It's even in an article.
[00:27:11.766 --> 00:27:14.728]  We've got CNN and MSNBC video clips coming up.
[00:27:14.728 --> 00:27:17.571]  We're gonna find them.
[00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:19.052]  Just type it into YouTube yourself.
[00:27:19.052 --> 00:27:22.614]  CNN claims Trump's source on the wiretapping is Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.614 --> 00:27:25.797]  It's Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow, both.
[00:27:25.797 --> 00:27:37.146]  All immoralized, saying that the source that the president got was us because they're listening to him at the time and they had moles and knew he was hearing it from me and Roger Stone!
[00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:40.641]  But it wasn't.
[00:27:40.641 --> 00:27:42.121]  I wasn't the source.
[00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:43.802]  Reality was the source.
[00:27:43.802 --> 00:27:47.302]  Eric Prince was the source.
[00:27:47.302 --> 00:27:51.623]  Sitcom was the source.
[00:27:51.623 --> 00:27:54.244]  Why do you think Trump would hear stuff I'd say and just go with it?
[00:27:54.244 --> 00:27:57.484]  Because he's already been told that by the Pentagon!
[00:27:57.484 --> 00:27:58.245]  Go after them!
[00:27:58.245 --> 00:27:58.965]  Go after them!
[00:27:58.965 --> 00:27:59.625]  Go after them!
[00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:00.245]  Go after them!
[00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:01.025]  Go after them!
[00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:02.605]  They're illegally spying on you!
[00:28:02.605 --> 00:28:03.686]  The whole campaign!
[00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:05.166]  They're trying to sabotage everything!
[00:28:06.462 --> 00:28:10.363]  And then every time Trump would talk to me or Roger Stone, that's all we start telling him.
[00:28:10.363 --> 00:28:12.223]  Just don't worry about this, sir.
[00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:12.923]  Great, thank you.
[00:28:12.923 --> 00:28:13.624]  They're coming after you.
[00:28:13.624 --> 00:28:14.304]  They're coming after you.
[00:28:14.304 --> 00:28:19.045]  They're spying on you.
[00:28:19.045 --> 00:28:23.286]  So, they're in trouble, folks.
[00:28:23.286 --> 00:28:24.806]  This is way beyond Watergate.
[00:28:24.806 --> 00:28:27.767]  There is now a criminal investigation by the DOJ.
[00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:47.143]  The area not controlled by Rosenstein and the Attorney General, the Inspector General that's truly independent in the Justice Department, and all the Inspector General's doing is finding massive crimes and lies and fraud, and the whole stinking rat's nest is now being exposed, and it is going to get spectacular.
[00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.984]  But here's the problem.
[00:28:48.984 --> 00:28:51.185]  The globalists are going to false flag.
[00:28:51.185 --> 00:28:52.725]  They're going to pull big stuff.
[00:28:52.725 --> 00:28:54.026]  You know it.
[00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:56.427]  This is the time to be totally vigilant.

[00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:35.764]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:35.764 --> 00:29:41.088]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.088 --> 00:29:46.772]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.772 --> 00:29:50.214]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.214 --> 00:29:53.337]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:30:06.073 --> 00:30:06.954]  It'd take hours.
[00:30:06.954 --> 00:30:09.396]  Michael's VX Plus, it now has a lower price.
[00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:10.577]  It's stronger.
[00:30:10.577 --> 00:30:12.178]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:15.401]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:16.522]  It's back in stock.
[00:30:16.522 --> 00:30:19.704]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:30:19.704 --> 00:30:23.027]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:30:23.427 --> 00:30:23.587]  I think?
[00:30:40.246 --> 00:30:41.447]  I don't know.
[00:30:59.964 --> 00:31:03.546]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:31:03.546 --> 00:31:05.326]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:31:05.326 --> 00:31:17.372]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:31:17.372 --> 00:31:26.116]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:31:26.576 --> 00:31:32.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.623]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:31:37.623 --> 00:31:40.244]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:31:40.244 --> 00:31:41.945]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:31:41.945 --> 00:31:46.768]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:51.934]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:31:51.934 --> 00:31:54.597]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:31:54.597 --> 00:32:00.123]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:32:00.123 --> 00:32:01.805]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:05.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.642 --> 00:33:32.703]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:32.703 --> 00:33:37.865]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:42.587]  So, if you just joined us, praise God.
[00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:44.187]  Thank you, Lord.
[00:33:44.187 --> 00:33:45.328]  Thank you.
[00:33:45.328 --> 00:33:48.429]  Thank you, listeners, for praying.
[00:33:48.429 --> 00:33:49.869]  Thank you for being politically active.
[00:33:49.869 --> 00:33:51.750]  Thank you for spreading the word.
[00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:57.792]  A year and a half later, after President Trump got into office, everything is turning around.
[00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:15.035]  Directly from a White House meeting with Kudlow, they're looking at the beginning of the next quarter, when the numbers come in, currently, when they release the new quarterly numbers, what is that, like a month or so?
[00:34:15.035 --> 00:34:17.077]  Four percent!
[00:34:17.077 --> 00:34:24.464]  And it's surging so fast, they think it might be 4.2, but they're concerned about inflation now.
[00:34:25.728 --> 00:34:31.872]  What you see starting to rear its ugly head, because the economy was so stalled, now it's heating up.
[00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:34.553]  What are the Democrats going to do there?
[00:34:34.553 --> 00:34:35.174]  Remember Obama?
[00:34:35.174 --> 00:34:36.254]  What are you going to do, Trump?
[00:34:36.254 --> 00:34:40.217]  Wave a magic wand?
[00:34:40.217 --> 00:34:47.741]  No, I'm just going to take the bowling ball off our leg.
[00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:49.382]  I'm just going to tell companies that
[00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:53.288]  We're not going to let them have tax exemption if they're overseas.
[00:34:53.288 --> 00:34:56.294]  And then we're going to penalize them and they're going to start coming back.
[00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:57.116]  And Trump's reasonable.
[00:34:57.116 --> 00:35:01.684]  He just says, listen, bring 20% back or I'm going to break your legs.
[00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:11.457]  That's all he's been doing is saying, give us something!
[00:35:11.457 --> 00:35:13.158]  He's not anti-American.
[00:35:13.158 --> 00:35:13.958]  He's pragmatic.
[00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:17.500]  He's like, why are the globalists so against America?
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.742]  Because they're allied with the communist Chinese and authoritarians and they hate this country.
[00:35:21.742 --> 00:35:24.283]  And I'm going to get into that coming up.
[00:35:24.283 --> 00:35:27.644]  But what Giuliani says, you go ahead and file your fake report.
[00:35:27.644 --> 00:35:28.685]  We're going to tear you apart.
[00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:31.661]  You want to fix this peacefully?
[00:35:31.661 --> 00:35:32.362]  Stop now.
[00:35:32.362 --> 00:35:35.702]  But if you don't, he starts laughing and says, we're going to tear you apart.
[00:35:35.702 --> 00:35:37.903]  And that isn't an empty threat.
[00:35:37.903 --> 00:35:44.405]  They are loaded for bear.
[00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:47.846]  Now let me show you a document Kim shot for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:49.846]  I'll read over this.
[00:35:49.846 --> 00:35:54.148]  Some articles going back to April and March of last year, 2017.
[00:35:54.148 --> 00:35:55.308]  And can you imagine
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:11.109]  The amount of pressure and heat we took and why they hate us so much, that we didn't just tell you how they were being illegally spied on.
[00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:12.810]  Where do you think our sources came from?
[00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:19.475]  I mean, this is known by the establishment, so I'll go ahead and tell you.
[00:36:19.475 --> 00:36:21.056]  It came from the U.S.
[00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:25.320]  Army, the Marine Corps, Defense Intelligence.
[00:36:27.517 --> 00:36:38.840]  Who have access to all the stuff that was going on because the military has even more access to everything than the mainline agencies do.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:47.103]  And they're watching Obama and the globalists in live time with communist Chinese money trying to stop the recovery of the nation.
[00:36:47.103 --> 00:36:53.064]  And by the recovery, it's like the globalists fumbled and we got the ball back.
[00:36:53.064 --> 00:36:55.425]  We haven't won the game yet, but we've recovered the ball.
[00:36:58.447 --> 00:37:13.016]  And now, we've gone through the first quarter, we're halfway to the second quarter, and we're 43-7.
[00:37:13.016 --> 00:37:18.119]  But if they kill our quarterback, we're going to be in trouble.
[00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:22.301]  So let's not start getting too excited here before the big halftime coming up, 2018.
[00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:22.962]  That's the real halftime.
[00:37:27.469 --> 00:37:34.474]  Trump gets back in in 2020, it'll be like legacy teams that win three Super Bowls in a row, in my view.
[00:37:34.474 --> 00:37:42.520]  But if we don't get to that next level, we are screwed, blued, and tattooed.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.122]  So, let's go back to these documents.
[00:37:45.122 --> 00:37:48.504]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[00:37:48.504 --> 00:37:51.907]  We didn't just tell you it was going on, we had
[00:37:54.196 --> 00:37:58.759]  Feds leak this to us directly, exclusively.
[00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:00.860]  Zero coverage in mainstream media.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:06.763]  Actual DEA NSA interfaces.
[00:38:06.763 --> 00:38:08.064]  Guess who's being surveilled?
[00:38:08.064 --> 00:38:10.665]  Alex Jones, Donald Trump.
[00:38:10.665 --> 00:38:12.026]  We're all listed here.
[00:38:12.026 --> 00:38:15.408]  Private addresses, private phone numbers.
[00:38:15.408 --> 00:38:17.569]  Homes that are in trust.
[00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:18.650]  Everything.
[00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:19.030]  All right here.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.044]  Zero, zero, zero, zero coverage.
[00:38:26.044 --> 00:38:29.908]  You think the folks that leaked this to us just did this because they want to have a little bit of fun?
[00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:32.510]  They risked their lives doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.133]  So, yeah, that's what InfoWars does.
[00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:40.458]  That's why they're coming after us, because we will stick it to them every time.
[00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:43.881]  We will do it because I fear Soros being in full control.
[00:38:44.864 --> 00:38:48.225]  I don't do this because I'm not afraid at a certain level.
[00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.586]  I'm afraid of them winning.
[00:38:49.586 --> 00:38:52.127]  They're so bad that I have no fear of what happens to me.
[00:38:52.127 --> 00:38:53.828]  Is that clear?
[00:38:53.828 --> 00:38:56.809]  And I keep going back to this so you understand why we're under attack.
[00:38:56.809 --> 00:38:58.410]  Because we are the tip of the spear.
[00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.410]  Why they demonize us.
[00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:00.350]  Why they lie about us.
[00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.411]  Why they come after us.
[00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:03.312]  Because we're telling the truth.
[00:39:03.312 --> 00:39:04.572]  Another document.
[00:39:04.572 --> 00:39:06.353]  The Hill.
[00:39:06.353 --> 00:39:11.455]  Roger Stone claims secret warrant but the discovery of his contact with hacker report.
[00:39:13.544 --> 00:39:19.849]  That's the Hill, March 15th.
[00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:26.433]  And of course it came out there were three illegal warrants, just as Stone had said.
[00:39:26.433 --> 00:39:29.135]  Stone wasn't just theorizing on this, he knew.
[00:39:29.135 --> 00:39:33.058]  Another one, Politico.
[00:39:33.058 --> 00:39:39.363]  Roger Stone convinced Obama administration got FISA warrant to monitor him.
[00:39:39.363 --> 00:39:39.663]  April
[00:39:41.673 --> 00:39:42.893]  Of the same time.
[00:39:42.893 --> 00:39:43.553]  Here's another one.
[00:39:43.553 --> 00:39:43.994]  Reuters.
[00:39:43.994 --> 00:39:45.034]  Exclusive.
[00:39:45.034 --> 00:39:45.534]  U.S.
[00:39:45.534 --> 00:39:50.675]  agents to cover up program use investigate Americans.
[00:39:50.675 --> 00:39:52.115]  Reuters.
[00:39:52.115 --> 00:39:59.517]  Inquiry by CIA affirms it spied on Senate panel.
[00:39:59.517 --> 00:40:00.497]  Bombshell!
[00:40:00.497 --> 00:40:04.638]  Obama's NSA illegally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[00:40:09.488 --> 00:40:15.097]  And now they admit they spied on his chairman, they spied on his lawyer, Mueller did, lied about it to Congress.
[00:40:15.097 --> 00:40:18.963]  That's next level, isn't it?
[00:40:18.963 --> 00:40:22.388]  So truly, we're next year's news today, but that's a side issue.
[00:40:24.648 --> 00:40:26.769]  Now there's a criminal investigation.
[00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:34.091]  Now they're closing in by the Inspector General of the illegal spying, which is cut and dry and all the perjury and all of it.
[00:40:34.091 --> 00:40:42.414]  And we've reached the maximum moment of danger because who knows what the globalists are going to do now to try to stop all this.
[00:40:42.414 --> 00:40:48.336]  Everybody should be praying hourly that we make it through this critical time because the enemy is cornered.
[00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:51.717]  They've committed incredible crimes and now they don't know what to do.
[00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:53.898]  Their arrogance, their bravado, their chutzpah.
[00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:58.593]  ...is draining away and now they are white as sheets.
[00:40:58.593 --> 00:41:08.838]  Now, here they are, 2017, claiming the President heard from InfoWars he was being illegally spied on.
[00:41:08.838 --> 00:41:11.380]  Which is true, but the President already knew it.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.682]  Here it is.
[00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:16.382]  Clip not ready?
[00:41:16.382 --> 00:41:17.283]  We were gonna play that.
[00:41:24.756 --> 00:41:27.698]  Oh God, it's unbelievable.
[00:41:27.698 --> 00:41:30.641]  These computers, I tell you, they just get crazier and crazier.
[00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:33.644]  It's like certain clips I want, I cannot have.
[00:41:33.644 --> 00:41:44.234]  There's like 50 clips of MSNBC, CNN, NPR, young Turks making fun of me, saying that there's no wiretapping, no spying.
[00:41:44.234 --> 00:41:49.279]  I'm wrong, I made it up, and I cannot find them if I had a billion dollars.
[00:41:51.343 --> 00:41:55.305]  There are articles on Infowars.com about it when we wrote about it at the time.
[00:41:55.305 --> 00:41:57.826]  But I just, we cannot report on ourselves.
[00:41:57.826 --> 00:42:07.692]  It's just a, it's like a black hole vacuum system where no matter how hard I try, I cannot have it.
[00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:08.512]  But you know what?
[00:42:08.512 --> 00:42:09.553]  You remember.
[00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.791]  You remember we told you exactly.
[00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:14.752]  You remember we broke it all down.
[00:42:14.752 --> 00:42:15.432]  You remember.
[00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:20.234]  And you know, for my own neurotic need and also for history, I haven't made a film in six, seven years.
[00:42:20.234 --> 00:42:21.615]  I keep saying I'm going to make one.
[00:42:21.615 --> 00:42:23.315]  Zach had a great idea.
[00:42:23.315 --> 00:42:24.196]  Make a film.
[00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:37.847]  About all the illegal spying because it's 50 times bigger than Watergate and this is really bringing down the deep state and it's so historical and exposing all their criminal activity and it's really a beautiful moment for everybody.
[00:42:37.847 --> 00:42:41.611]  So we'll see if I can go back back there like I wanted to and get the clip.
[00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:46.295]  There's a bunch of clips and we're gonna see or I should just suspend the show till I have them.
[00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:48.376]  We'll go to rebroadcast until I have those clips.
[00:42:48.376 --> 00:42:49.037]  I'm not mad.
[00:42:49.037 --> 00:42:50.578]  I'm actually very excited.
[00:42:50.578 --> 00:42:55.902]  It's just that at a certain point you gotta have what you gotta have when you gotta have it.
[00:42:55.902 --> 00:42:58.244]  Like the 500 clips of Roger Stone saying the same thing.
[00:42:59.949 --> 00:43:00.730]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:10.876]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:10.876 --> 00:43:19.402]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:19.402 --> 00:43:28.148]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:30.267 --> 00:43:49.857]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.857 --> 00:43:52.538]  It is amazing!
[00:43:52.538 --> 00:43:57.521]  Red Pill, now available at m4warsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:03.494]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:44:03.494 --> 00:44:06.236]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:44:06.236 --> 00:44:11.039]  That's why Info Wars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:13.461]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[00:46:00.131 --> 00:46:07.777]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:46:07.777 --> 00:46:15.703]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:46:15.703 --> 00:46:18.786]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:46:19.406 --> 00:46:24.051]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:46:24.051 --> 00:46:28.194]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:46:28.194 --> 00:46:31.337]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:46:31.337 --> 00:46:36.102]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually know what we have to say.
[00:46:36.102 --> 00:46:39.145]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:54.392]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:46:54.392 --> 00:46:56.172]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:46:56.172 --> 00:47:03.736]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:47:03.736 --> 00:47:06.357]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.822 --> 00:47:37.323]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:37.323 --> 00:47:39.503]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:49.385]  So, if you want to know why they hate us, if you want to know why they're always trying to shut Infowars down, it's because even Fox, other than a few of their hosts, are cowards.
[00:47:49.385 --> 00:47:51.466]  And they will not go on air with all this stuff.
[00:47:51.466 --> 00:47:56.407]  You've heard Sean Hannity for a year saying they illegally spied on the president because it's been confirmed for a year.
[00:47:58.086 --> 00:48:03.569]  And they call him a conspiracy theorist and George Soros attacks him and they have boycotts want to take him off the air.
[00:48:03.569 --> 00:48:07.112]  Because they've committed serious crimes.
[00:48:07.112 --> 00:48:09.253]  And they're getting caught doing it.
[00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:09.773]  So what?
[00:48:09.773 --> 00:48:17.418]  Here's a report from early 2017 with Anderson Cooper.
[00:48:17.418 --> 00:48:23.122]  There's an Infowars.com article that accompanies, we can put that on screen so later I'll give you the actual date.
[00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:27.956]  Where they're saying that the President got all this from InfoWars.
[00:48:27.956 --> 00:48:30.059]  No, he didn't get it from InfoWars.
[00:48:30.059 --> 00:48:33.824]  He got it from the Pentagon, snot-nose.
[00:48:33.824 --> 00:48:37.870]  And he got it from the documents that we published as well.
[00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:38.851]  So, here's that report.
[00:48:39.926 --> 00:48:47.568]  This reminds me of the scene in Annie Hall where two people are talking about Marshall McLuhan's work and Woody Allen gets annoyed and says, you know what, I just happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here.
[00:48:47.568 --> 00:48:52.049]  So we're very glad we happen to have the reporter who wrote the story that is being quoted now by Sean Spicer.
[00:48:52.049 --> 00:48:54.990]  I want to get your reaction to what we just heard.
[00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:59.591]  What do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence?
[00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:08.334]  I mean, it's getting bizarre at this point, because we've said it very clearly, and I said on your show, that that's not what the story said.
[00:49:08.334 --> 00:49:11.835]  Anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said.
[00:49:11.835 --> 00:49:21.058]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on this kind of fringe right-wing media.
[00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:28.320]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.264]  And now, a few weeks later, the White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:49:34.264 --> 00:49:41.409]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[00:49:41.409 --> 00:49:45.692]  And just to be clear, there is... Stop right there!
[00:49:45.692 --> 00:49:49.995]  Notice how they try to look so smug, so confident, where you look at the camera and you go...
[00:49:51.158 --> 00:49:55.083]  They claim the moon is made of rock, but really it's made of cheese.
[00:49:55.083 --> 00:50:08.542]  It's ridiculous how extreme and right-wing we are, claiming the moon is made of rock, when everyone knows it's made of the finest green Swiss cheese, and that little Martians fly by and get scoops of it and go back to Mars and feed it to their little baby Martians.
[00:50:10.697 --> 00:50:14.441]  And then Alex Jones claims that the sky is blue and that water is wet.
[00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:16.623]  We all know that's not true here at CNN.
[00:50:16.623 --> 00:50:18.264]  It's just bizarre.
[00:50:18.264 --> 00:50:24.470]  And then they do this over and over and over and over again in this huge confidence game, hoping you don't have any memory.
[00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.531]  Let's finish up with the clip.
[00:50:25.531 --> 00:50:25.832]  Here it is.
[00:50:26.448 --> 00:50:35.992]  There's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[00:50:35.992 --> 00:50:36.372]  Nothing.
[00:50:36.372 --> 00:50:39.113]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story.
[00:50:39.113 --> 00:50:40.553]  That we would be rushing it.
[00:50:40.553 --> 00:50:41.434]  I would not be sitting here with you.
[00:50:41.434 --> 00:50:43.534]  I'd be at home writing it or out reporting it.
[00:50:43.534 --> 00:50:46.856]  We said that there were intercepted communications.
[00:50:46.856 --> 00:50:52.638]  In subsequent reporting, we've said that these communications were Russians talking to each other about contacts- No, stop there.
[00:50:52.638 --> 00:50:55.139]  Oh, we said there were intercepted communications.
[00:50:55.139 --> 00:50:55.179]  No.
[00:50:56.874 --> 00:51:11.683]  You had, six months before Trump even got the nomination, you had your operation going full steam, and we even know the name of it.
[00:51:11.683 --> 00:51:19.508]  And we even know the spies that you tried to put into the Trump campaign to plant Russian collusion.
[00:51:19.508 --> 00:51:25.652]  Operation Crossfire Hurricane and Stefan Halperin, and the list is just going to grow
[00:51:26.914 --> 00:51:33.359]  Grow and grow and grow and grow and grow.
[00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.601]  So there's a criminal investigation of this.
[00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:36.642]  They've been caught doing it.
[00:51:36.642 --> 00:51:39.104]  The FBI admits it was going on.
[00:51:39.104 --> 00:51:40.866]  I should just open the whole broadcast up with this.
[00:51:40.866 --> 00:51:43.308]  The FBI now admits
[00:51:44.363 --> 00:51:50.548]  That they were illegally spying on the Trump campaign under orders from President Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:51:50.548 --> 00:52:02.517]  And that they lied to Congress, and that they lied under oath, and that they lied to the court to get the fake warrants to parallel construct illegal investigations that were already going on.
[00:52:02.517 --> 00:52:08.662]  So, ding dong, the witch is dead, the witch, oh witch, the witch, witch, witch, ding dong, the wicked witch is dead!
[00:52:08.662 --> 00:52:10.163]  But that doesn't mean that's going to happen yet.
[00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:17.754]  Because the media is going to try to confuse this and manipulate this where people that aren't paying attention won't know what's going on.
[00:52:17.754 --> 00:52:31.143]  Or people that don't care that they've been told thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times that there was no spying and it's totally insane when they were all involved!
[00:52:31.143 --> 00:52:35.366]  The New York Times bragged!
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.902]  In early January!
[00:52:38.902 --> 00:52:48.050]  That they were spying on Trump, that they were working with the people spying on him, that Obama was spying on him, and that they had the dirt, they had the proof!
[00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:57.798]  So they could then confidently tell federal bureaucrats, don't worry, we know he's a Russian agent, don't do what he says, he'll be out before he's even inaugurated.
[00:52:57.798 --> 00:53:01.041]  Then, he'll be out in a few months, then he'll be out by the end of 2017.
[00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:03.303]  We're gonna kill this guy!
[00:53:05.179 --> 00:53:16.384]  Remember they started having Deputy Director of the FBI and CIA, he'd been both, Mudd, go on CNN and say, we're just gonna kill this president.
[00:53:16.384 --> 00:53:21.207]  The guy was down at Foddy Boggan and we're getting ready to kill him.
[00:53:21.207 --> 00:53:26.569]  And the same week you got Brennan and Clapper on TV going, we're gonna take him out.
[00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:27.870]  What do you mean, impeachment?
[00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.371]  No, he'll just be gone in two months.
[00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:29.791]  You watch.
[00:53:34.713 --> 00:53:38.477]  Because they're all going to prison if they don't get Trump out!
[00:53:38.477 --> 00:53:39.798]  So they keep running this con game.
[00:53:39.798 --> 00:53:40.679]  He's mentally ill.
[00:53:40.679 --> 00:53:41.840]  He's gonna die.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.681]  He's gonna be out.
[00:53:42.681 --> 00:53:44.202]  All the TV shows hit him.
[00:53:44.202 --> 00:53:45.263]  All the programs hit him.
[00:53:45.263 --> 00:53:46.785]  They all say horrible things.
[00:53:46.785 --> 00:53:48.647]  Trying to tank the economy.
[00:53:48.647 --> 00:53:50.628]  Trying to get somebody to make a move.
[00:53:50.628 --> 00:53:53.051]  Trying to find something, but every day that passes.
[00:53:53.291 --> 00:53:54.992]  They're losing their people in government.
[00:53:54.992 --> 00:53:59.033]  Every day that passes, mainstream media is losing its ratings and falling apart and killing itself.
[00:53:59.033 --> 00:54:03.194]  And the NFL tried to kill Trump and the relaunch of America, so it's falling apart.
[00:54:03.194 --> 00:54:05.395]  And Hollywood's down 30, 40 percent.
[00:54:05.395 --> 00:54:07.915]  They're falling apart because they try to take down Trump.
[00:54:07.915 --> 00:54:12.677]  And almost every Netflix show is anti-American, anti-Trump, and that's not working.
[00:54:12.677 --> 00:54:20.659]  They've weaponized the schools, and they've got Mueller going after him, raiding his lawyer, and doing all this criminal stuff, illegally spying and telling Congress they didn't do it.
[00:54:23.482 --> 00:54:36.748]  And you've got Mueller's former deputy director saying the government's going to kill this guy, all as a confidence act to their criminal stay-behind networks to make them all think everything is going to be okay.
[00:54:36.748 --> 00:54:40.110]  So they stay at the job and keep prosecuting their operations.
[00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.111]  This is how criminal psychology works.
[00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:43.391]  It's all a big con game.
[00:54:43.391 --> 00:54:44.552]  It's all a manipulation.
[00:54:44.552 --> 00:54:46.113]  It's not straight shooting.
[00:54:46.113 --> 00:54:47.373]  It's not real work.
[00:54:47.373 --> 00:54:49.294]  It's not actually knowing what you're doing.
[00:54:49.294 --> 00:54:50.475]  It's not actually delivering.
[00:54:51.135 --> 00:54:52.696]  It's all flim flam.
[00:54:52.696 --> 00:54:54.378]  You ever been around L.A.
[00:54:54.378 --> 00:54:57.100]  and all the fake people that have now moved to Austin?
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.341]  They work about one day a week.
[00:54:58.341 --> 00:54:59.101]  They're all talk.
[00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:00.342]  They're all imaginary.
[00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:03.845]  They all run around trying to create conspiracies against people.
[00:55:03.845 --> 00:55:04.986]  That's the way D.C.
[00:55:04.986 --> 00:55:05.386]  is.
[00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:09.769]  And Trump's coming in a construction foreman.
[00:55:09.769 --> 00:55:12.111]  He's coming in somebody that's all about O.C.D.
[00:55:12.111 --> 00:55:13.092]  getting it done.
[00:55:13.092 --> 00:55:13.732]  O.C.D.
[00:55:13.732 --> 00:55:14.873]  being a winner.
[00:55:14.873 --> 00:55:15.714]  O.C.D.
[00:55:15.714 --> 00:55:18.396]  He's obsessive compulsive about winning!
[00:55:19.574 --> 00:55:23.817]  And about not having a bunch of destabilization and a bunch of garbage.
[00:55:23.817 --> 00:55:26.680]  Trump knows you take over with success.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:31.063]  You take over with delivering and people wanting to be Americana.
[00:55:31.063 --> 00:55:32.925]  And Americana is coming back.
[00:55:32.925 --> 00:55:35.847]  And all you idiots that bet against America.
[00:55:35.847 --> 00:55:39.610]  And all you idiots that sat there and bet against Infowars.
[00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:40.871]  And bet against Trump.
[00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:43.033]  And bet against it all.
[00:55:43.033 --> 00:55:46.736]  You people are selling tyranny, something other folks don't want.
[00:55:48.916 --> 00:55:50.677]  You understand that?
[00:55:50.677 --> 00:55:53.959]  And so, your system's in trouble, and you'll never win.
[00:55:53.959 --> 00:55:59.242]  And I'm not just up here like a con man, like CNN, saying, oh, we're gonna win, oh, we're unstoppable.
[00:55:59.242 --> 00:56:01.843]  I'm up here with a track record proving it.
[00:56:01.843 --> 00:56:05.005]  And you know that, and that's why you're so incredibly scared.
[00:56:07.392 --> 00:56:13.618]  Now, it doesn't mean Soros and Hillary aren't suing us, doesn't mean they're not trying to shut us down, doesn't mean they're not running dirty tricks and trying to destroy my family.
[00:56:13.618 --> 00:56:21.807]  We need your prayers, number one, and we need you to spread the articles and the videos and the information of the four winds and to take action.
[00:56:21.807 --> 00:56:24.770]  But they are caught in criminal activity.
[00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:27.433]  Their whole network is beginning to come down.
[00:56:27.433 --> 00:56:29.555]  And right now is the moment of maximum danger.
[00:56:37.133 --> 00:56:39.696]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:42.939]  And, of course, financial support.
[00:56:42.939 --> 00:56:46.322]  But, I mean, what's the point of plugging at the end of every hour anyways?
[00:56:46.322 --> 00:56:47.804]  I don't even listen to the end of the hour.
[00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:50.146]  They tune in at the first of the hour and no one cares anymore.
[00:56:50.146 --> 00:56:53.490]  I mean, at least people that are in the know don't care.
[00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.493]  They don't realize that we're this close to winning, we're this close to losing.
[00:56:57.634 --> 00:57:02.056]  I mean, this is a total war against control freak scum, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:02.056 --> 00:57:13.241]  And if the American people just put out a little bit more energy, standing up to the bureaucrats, standing up to the intimidation, standing up to the garbage, we would turn the tide incredibly well.
[00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:22.024]  But they've created a mesmerized TV head world of people who just can't get themselves out of the box.
[00:57:22.024 --> 00:57:25.606]  But they're still a minority of awake, focused, dedicated people.
[00:57:26.445 --> 00:57:27.005]  We're good to go.
[00:57:49.366 --> 00:57:55.651]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[00:59:53.253 --> 00:59:59.675]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.675 --> 01:00:04.657]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.926 --> 01:00:09.308]  Here's the truth about gun control.
[01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:17.915]  Many times, these mass shootings are actually case and point examples as to why gun control doesn't work.
[01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:21.258]  And the recent Santa Fe shooting is a prime example.
[01:00:21.258 --> 01:00:28.383]  The Santa Fe shooter, only 17 years old, took his father's firearm to commit this mass shooting.
[01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:32.607]  And yes, stealing your father's gun is illegally obtaining a firearm.
[01:00:32.887 --> 01:00:40.392]  Federal firearm laws already prohibit firearm sales to anyone under 18.
[01:00:40.392 --> 01:00:49.038]  I guess the argument to ban guns kind of falls through when these shooters use guns that were obtained illegally.
[01:00:49.038 --> 01:00:52.861]  Does Mexico not have mass shootings because they've banned guns?
[01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:56.944]  Actually, they have cartels that go and massacre whole villages.
[01:00:57.384 --> 01:01:10.014]  Another common argument amongst gun control advocates is that we should ban all assault rifles and bump stocks in order to prevent mass casualties.
[01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:12.495]  What is an assault rifle?
[01:01:12.495 --> 01:01:14.117]  Is that just a made-up word?
[01:01:14.117 --> 01:01:16.598]  Do rifles assault people?
[01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:22.203]  Or is it the people behind the guns that are assaulting people with guns?
[01:01:22.203 --> 01:01:26.506]  Last I knew, guns don't just pick themselves up and start firing on people.
[01:01:26.886 --> 01:01:32.171]  I guess you can put assault in front of anything to make it sound big and scary.
[01:01:32.171 --> 01:01:37.895]  Assault cars, assault trucks, assault sticks, assault flags, assault rice cookers.
[01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:52.948]  A 17-year-old mass shooter wielding a sawed-off shotgun killing 10 and wounding 10 is kind of proof that you don't need an assault rifle or an AR-15 or bump stocks to commit mass carnage.
[01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:57.413]  We've seen more carnage in China in a mass knife attack.
[01:01:57.413 --> 01:02:00.736]  So essentially, you can use anything to kill a lot of people.
[01:02:00.736 --> 01:02:04.661]  Prison inmates can find ways to kill people with sporks.
[01:02:04.661 --> 01:02:08.585]  That's why there are so many items banned from prisons.
[01:02:08.585 --> 01:02:10.988]  Do we want to live in a giant prison?
[01:02:11.448 --> 01:02:17.956]  No, banning AR-15s will not stop mass shootings with mass casualties.
[01:02:17.956 --> 01:02:20.679]  Here's one we hear amongst the left and the right.
[01:02:20.679 --> 01:02:22.180]  Fatherlessness is to blame.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.704]  That's why these mass shootings are happening and this is how we can prevent them.
[01:02:25.704 --> 01:02:26.305]  More fathers in
[01:02:26.465 --> 01:02:33.009]  As much as I like the idea of more fathers being in the home, this simply isn't a valid solution.
[01:02:33.009 --> 01:02:43.276]  The Santa Fe shooter's father apparently was in the home because it was his father's gun that he stole and used to then go commit the mass shooting.
[01:02:43.276 --> 01:02:48.059]  Here are some real solutions that might actually make a difference.
[01:02:48.359 --> 01:02:53.543]  First, for the mainstream media to stop making every one of these shooters famous.
[01:02:53.543 --> 01:03:04.793]  I mean, the Parkland shooter has been receiving tons of fan mail and love letters from teenagers ever since he did this shooting and got all of this worldwide attention.
[01:03:04.793 --> 01:03:12.420]  But God forbid the mainstream media not exploit another tragedy in order to push their anti-gun agenda.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.941]  More guns!
[01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:14.802]  Did you get triggered?
[01:03:15.342 --> 01:03:16.342]  Did I just trigger you again?
[01:03:16.342 --> 01:03:16.542]  And again?
[01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:16.902]  And again?
[01:03:16.902 --> 01:03:17.102]  And again?
[01:03:17.102 --> 01:03:17.882]  Are you getting triggered?
[01:03:17.882 --> 01:03:18.543]  Or confused?
[01:03:18.543 --> 01:03:20.283]  But yes, I did say more guns.
[01:03:20.283 --> 01:03:23.664]  The people of Switzerland are heavily armed.
[01:03:23.664 --> 01:03:25.064]  And surprise!
[01:03:25.064 --> 01:03:27.684]  Mass shootings are very rare.
[01:03:27.684 --> 01:03:38.166]  There have been several instances where armed security or armed civilians have actually stopped mass shootings or greatly minimized the carnage.
[01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:42.727]  And yet, these stories are rarely reported on by the mainstream media.
[01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:53.482]  November 2017, an off-duty Kansas police officer stopped a potential mass shooting in a Costco when an armed man entered and said, I'm going to kill people.
[01:03:53.482 --> 01:03:57.488]  He was able to neutralize the shooter and prevent a mass shooting.
[01:03:58.189 --> 01:04:04.053]  September 2017, a shooter entered a Nashville church and shot seven people.
[01:04:04.053 --> 01:04:12.698]  A man in the church was able to run out to his car, obtain his firearm, and come back and neutralize the shooter, saving untold lives.
[01:04:12.698 --> 01:04:25.126]  May 2015, a man pulled into a South Carolina fire department and began shooting on people and children, when a firefighter with a concealed carry permit returned fire and neutralized the subject.
[01:04:25.746 --> 01:04:32.668]  Experts have told us that predators like to prey on the weak and those less likely to defend themselves.
[01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:41.450]  There are many stories and instances where armed civilians or armed security have stopped and prevented mass shootings.
[01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.931]  The solution is already there.
[01:04:43.931 --> 01:04:47.012]  The mainstream media just doesn't want you to know it.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:54.866]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:04:54.866 --> 01:04:58.149]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:04:58.149 --> 01:05:05.696]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:18.126]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:20.227]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.227 --> 01:05:24.211]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:25.452]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:31.496]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.496 --> 01:05:33.878]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:36.499]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:39.301]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.301 --> 01:05:41.803]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.803 --> 01:05:50.989]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:55.432]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:05:59.234 --> 01:06:04.396]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[01:06:04.396 --> 01:06:17.562]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state
[01:06:17.602 --> 01:06:18.422]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:42.492]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[01:06:42.492 --> 01:06:53.838]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:06:55.058 --> 01:07:04.491]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[01:07:04.491 --> 01:07:05.813]  Demand truth.
[01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:07.535]  Demand InfoWars.
[01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.426]  InfoWars.
[01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:11.627]  Tomorrow's News.
[01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:12.787]  Today.
[01:07:12.787 --> 01:07:21.430]  One thing that happens when you make as many wild, unproven claims as Trump does is that the people around you have to go to increasingly ridiculous lengths to try to defend those claims.
[01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:32.394]  And this weekend we saw another example of that when White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked if she had any proof for Trump's outlandish claim that Obama wiretapped him during the campaign and offered this bizarre answer.
[01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:36.611]  How does he know that his phone was actually tapped?
[01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:37.772]  Let me answer that globally.
[01:07:37.772 --> 01:07:39.152]  He's the President of the United States.
[01:07:39.152 --> 01:07:42.533]  He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.
[01:07:42.533 --> 01:07:42.873]  You know what?
[01:07:42.873 --> 01:07:44.094]  Yeah, I'll agree with that.
[01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:46.775]  Trump has intelligence that I definitely do not.
[01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:49.355]  I agree.
[01:07:49.355 --> 01:07:51.336]  Listen, people, one more time.
[01:07:51.336 --> 01:07:54.278]  Trump's accusation is ridiculous and pathetic.
[01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:55.960]  He's suggesting a U.S.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.043]  president enlisted a foreign intelligence service to spy on a political adversary.
[01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:01.524]  That is an explosive charge!
[01:08:01.524 --> 01:08:02.845]  This is a serious allegation.
[01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:08.709]  This might be the most serious allegation any president has made against a previous president.
[01:08:08.949 --> 01:08:12.672]  This is a very serious allegation for a sitting president to make about his predecessor.
[01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:19.476]  Trump tweeted, terrible, just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory.
[01:08:19.476 --> 01:08:20.096]  Nothing found.
[01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.237]  This is McCarthyism.
[01:08:21.237 --> 01:08:27.201]  And the other one, how low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process?
[01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:29.903]  This is Nixon Watergate, bad or sick guy.
[01:08:29.903 --> 01:08:31.884]  He said Obama is either bad or sick.
[01:08:33.465 --> 01:08:33.805]  Sick guy.
[01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:34.966]  Maybe he means from his compliments.
[01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:36.306]  Like, yeah, man, he's bad.
[01:08:36.306 --> 01:08:37.827]  He's a bad guy.
[01:08:37.827 --> 01:08:46.391]  The NSA's deputy director told the BBC it was arrogant nonsense, revealing a complete lack of understanding in how the relationship works.
[01:08:46.391 --> 01:08:50.713]  And for their part, GCHQ called the accusations utterly ridiculous.
[01:08:50.713 --> 01:08:55.116]  And yet, rather than distancing himself from Spicer, Trump decided to back him up.
[01:08:55.116 --> 01:08:57.837]  Are you asking if I wiretapped Donald Trump?
[01:08:59.088 --> 01:08:59.469]  Of course.
[01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.750]  I did it!
[01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:10.342]  How low has President Obama gone to tap-pa-pa my phones during the very sacred election process?
[01:09:10.342 --> 01:09:12.765]  This is Nixon slash Watergate.
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.851]  Hello?
[01:09:14.851 --> 01:09:19.458]  Hey Barack, sorry we had to investigate you on this wiretapping thing.
[01:09:19.458 --> 01:09:20.980]  But you know I didn't do that.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.123]  I know, but we still have to investigate it.
[01:09:23.123 --> 01:09:26.368]  Otherwise it'll look like I'm just mentally unstable.
[01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:30.494]  The craziest thing about Trump calling for an investigation without any evidence.
[01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:31.855]  Zero evidence.
[01:09:31.855 --> 01:09:33.835]  Trump has not produced a shred of evidence.
[01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:35.836]  There was no evidence for Trump's claims.
[01:09:35.836 --> 01:09:37.597]  The evidence did not come.
[01:09:37.597 --> 01:09:39.258]  So, where did Trump get his info?
[01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:40.578]  From the CIA?
[01:09:40.578 --> 01:09:41.679]  From the FBI?
[01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.720]  Where are you getting this information?
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.741]  From a very reputable source.
[01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:46.081]  What?
[01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:46.901]  The FBI?
[01:09:46.901 --> 01:09:47.701]  The CIA?
[01:09:47.701 --> 01:09:48.762]  Info Wars.
[01:09:48.762 --> 01:09:51.603]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:09:51.603 --> 01:09:56.245]  You know he's legit.
[01:09:56.245 --> 01:10:00.067]  Ah, Alec Baldwin, you've been very useful to me, said Kim Jong-il.
[01:10:02.056 --> 01:10:19.119]  And of course, if you just joined us last hour, I went into an information blitz, shilling hundreds of articles where they were admittedly spying illegally on Trump, and now the FBI admits it, and now there's a criminal investigation by the Inspector General in the Justice Department.
[01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:29.441]  And we have Brennan, we have Clapper, we have Comey, we have Mueller, all caught perjuring themselves before Congress.
[01:10:32.096 --> 01:10:33.136]  Here's our article.
[01:10:33.136 --> 01:10:34.957]  Jerome Corsi, March of last year.
[01:10:34.957 --> 01:10:36.138]  It's over a year ago.
[01:10:36.138 --> 01:10:39.639]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Trump and his family.
[01:10:39.639 --> 01:10:43.401]  We have the actual NSA documents.
[01:10:43.401 --> 01:10:45.142]  Top secret.
[01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:47.122]  That no one else has.
[01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:49.984]  The government didn't come after me and the media didn't say it was a lie.
[01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:53.285]  They just ignored it.
[01:10:53.285 --> 01:10:54.165]  See right there?
[01:10:54.165 --> 01:10:54.926]  How did we know?
[01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:57.339]  Where did we get the information?
[01:10:57.339 --> 01:10:58.400]  Where did the President get it?
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.621]  Alex Jones.
[01:10:59.621 --> 01:11:03.363]  Well, in the case of this, he did get it, actually, from the DEA.
[01:11:03.363 --> 01:11:05.785]  That's where the President got it.
[01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:15.332]  And the folks involved here, and the people that have gotten all this information, they tried to get it to the President, but we were able to.
[01:11:15.332 --> 01:11:17.374]  Oh, and then Joe Arpaio got his, uh...
[01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.551]  Pardon, wasn't that nice too?
[01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:23.693]  He got that information from us as well.
[01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:34.559]  And again, here we are in the news, going back to March of last year, CNN saying, I'm a liar, I'm insane, there's no illegal spying going on against the President.
[01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:40.062]  But then here's even Reuters, they can't even get their disinfo together, U.S.
[01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:43.304]  directs agents to cover up programs used to investigate Americans.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.461]  But they do it without warrants.
[01:11:48.461 --> 01:11:52.343]  And then when they think they've dug something up, then they go get the warrant and then reverse engineer it from there.
[01:11:52.343 --> 01:11:54.324]  It's called parallel construction.
[01:11:54.324 --> 01:11:57.565]  Remember they spied on Congress?
[01:11:57.565 --> 01:12:00.126]  July 31st, 2014.
[01:12:00.126 --> 01:12:09.171]  Inquiry by CIA affirms it spied on the panel that oversees the CIA.
[01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:13.172]  That is the fox guarding the old hen house, isn't it?
[01:12:13.172 --> 01:12:16.094]  And then we've got more documentation.
[01:12:17.517 --> 01:12:20.039]  Of all of that, my friends.
[01:12:20.039 --> 01:12:21.400]  So, why are they mad at us?
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:29.686]  Because we aren't playing ball with the globalists.
[01:12:29.686 --> 01:12:32.087]  So what's going to happen now?
[01:12:32.087 --> 01:12:47.118]  Well, DOJ confirms they started a criminal investigation of Obama and of the Clinton campaign and the reports they ordered illegal spying on candidate, nominee, President-elect, and then President Trump.
[01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:56.516]  And Trump on the weekend said that he was demanding that they open a criminal investigation, and they've now done it!
[01:12:56.516 --> 01:12:58.577]  And CNN calls it dangerous.
[01:12:58.577 --> 01:13:00.979]  No, you are dangerous.
[01:13:00.979 --> 01:13:02.159]  You've been caught lying.
[01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:05.401]  You are very fake news, to quote the President.
[01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:14.146]  And you've been caught now with a bunch of your operatives, a rogue government element, trying to overturn the election of the American people.
[01:13:15.848 --> 01:13:18.690]  And you can see with each waning day, you're losing power.
[01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.352]  With each waning day, you're collapsing.
[01:13:20.352 --> 01:13:25.616]  With each waning day, it's guaranteed already that you will be defeated.
[01:13:25.616 --> 01:13:36.566]  Now, if you want to go on some kamikaze mission against us, try to hold us off or take some of us out that led the attack on you, you might get away with that, but you'll be more destroyed in the end because of that.
[01:13:37.864 --> 01:13:40.225]  You are defeated.
[01:13:40.225 --> 01:13:41.665]  You are crushed.
[01:13:41.665 --> 01:13:43.366]  It's over for you.
[01:13:43.366 --> 01:13:57.810]  It's all coming out and we're going to make sure everybody remembers all the things they said and all the things they did when they got up there on all the late night comedy shows and lied and on CNN lied and all the rest.
[01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.772]  Now, it's critical that everybody go check out this article.
[01:14:02.674 --> 01:14:07.095]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Trump and his family.
[01:14:07.095 --> 01:14:11.856]  And we have the other articles up on the site that go through it all.
[01:14:11.856 --> 01:14:17.417]  The criminal investigation that has been open, the FBI admitting that they were spying, that they had infiltrated.
[01:14:17.417 --> 01:14:20.518]  That was in the New York Times on Friday.
[01:14:20.518 --> 01:14:21.998]  Do you think they like that?
[01:14:21.998 --> 01:14:24.119]  Boy, they sure hope you don't have a memory.
[01:14:24.119 --> 01:14:24.879]  Let me stop right there.
[01:14:26.314 --> 01:14:45.445]  If you like the information we're putting out, and like crushing the globalists, and like returning the country to its greatness, and like moving us forward, and like seeing 4% growth rate, is the word that you heard here first, that we're going to be getting in the new quarter lease, when those numbers come in, please support the InfoWarp.

[01:18:07.929 --> 01:18:15.797]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:18:15.797 --> 01:18:18.961]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:24.406]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[01:19:54.084 --> 01:19:55.625]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:34.238 --> 01:20:40.686]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.686 --> 01:20:41.927]  What we are looking at...
[01:20:58.661 --> 01:21:02.286]  Alright, we had Dr. Nick Baggage scheduled for about a week to come on.
[01:21:02.286 --> 01:21:09.154]  The first guy to really expose what's now mainstream news, using cell phone waves to control the brain.
[01:21:09.154 --> 01:21:16.103]  He went off the patents, he went off the research, he went off the science of that.
[01:21:19.901 --> 01:21:23.782]  And now it's suddenly being announced as mainstream news.
[01:21:23.782 --> 01:21:32.645]  And the fact that 5G is super destructive when it comes to the DNA, basically rattles it apart and causing massive cancer increases.
[01:21:32.645 --> 01:21:36.127]  So he's gonna be popping in for just two segments coming up.
[01:21:36.127 --> 01:21:39.448]  I'm gonna give him back for a full hour in the near future.
[01:21:39.448 --> 01:21:45.550]  And he's gonna be hosting some podcasts and shows with us as we expand our operations.
[01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:48.931]  Now, joining us is Roger Stone with a quick pop-in
[01:21:50.456 --> 01:22:13.099]  On not just eight of his associates being dragged off the street last week in a FBI dragnet, but also we are going to be looking at the huge news that there is now a criminal investigation by the Inspector General taking place against Hillary.
[01:22:14.485 --> 01:22:18.109]  And the campaign and Obama ordering it and we know they ordered it.
[01:22:18.109 --> 01:22:21.932]  The FISA court put out a report that what happened was illegal last year.
[01:22:21.932 --> 01:22:23.914]  It's got no coverage.
[01:22:23.914 --> 01:22:28.619]  We have the documents we got from Sheriff's Arpaio's office.
[01:22:28.619 --> 01:22:31.142]  NSA documents surveilling Trump and myself.
[01:22:31.142 --> 01:22:31.942]  That was confirmed.
[01:22:32.963 --> 01:22:46.733]  We had them bragging when he was president-elect that, don't worry, we've been spying on him, we've got proof of Russiagate, so that people in government would stay confident and basically be mutinous against Trump when he got in, in the belief that he was illegitimate.
[01:22:46.733 --> 01:22:48.455]  But all that was a lie.
[01:22:48.455 --> 01:22:51.297]  They were spying, but there was no dirt.
[01:22:51.297 --> 01:22:53.118]  And now we know the name of the mole.
[01:22:53.118 --> 01:22:56.541]  We broke it five days before the New York Times.
[01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:57.842]  We knew his name months before, but
[01:22:58.502 --> 01:22:59.983]  Didn't want to get sued.
[01:22:59.983 --> 01:23:02.885]  And that was Stefan Halperin.
[01:23:02.885 --> 01:23:05.127]  And that's now confirmed by the New York Times on Friday.
[01:23:05.127 --> 01:23:06.969]  But he's just one of the moles.
[01:23:06.969 --> 01:23:19.979]  But not a mole to actually find Russiagate, but to create discussions about it, so at least there'd be some discussion of Russians and influence, when later the FBI would ask members of the Trump campaign about it.
[01:23:21.226 --> 01:23:24.929]  That way there'd at least be some discussion of collusion.
[01:23:24.929 --> 01:23:26.090]  But again, they failed.
[01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.931]  They came up dry.
[01:23:26.931 --> 01:23:31.155]  So I want to get Roger Stone to pop in quickly on how big this is.
[01:23:31.155 --> 01:23:35.919]  The president over the weekend said, I'm demanding a criminal investigation in his tweet.
[01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:42.225]  Today it has been opened and the globalists, the leftists, they are in fear.
[01:23:42.225 --> 01:23:42.465]  Roger?
[01:23:44.094 --> 01:23:49.556]  Alex, it's great to be with you, and that was, I think, a very good summary.
[01:23:49.556 --> 01:23:56.118]  I'm here at the Baptist Hospital in Kendall, Florida, where my wife has undergone emergency surgery.
[01:23:56.118 --> 01:24:03.461]  I believe in the power of prayer, so I ask for all the InfoWarriors to please pray for her.
[01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:08.983]  She'll be fine, but it is a major surgery, came up as kind of a surprise.
[01:24:10.267 --> 01:24:11.128]  Well, absolutely.
[01:24:11.128 --> 01:24:11.648]  I knew about that.
[01:24:11.648 --> 01:24:17.153]  I didn't want to say that on air, but since you brought it up, because that's your privacy, now folks really should pray for her.
[01:24:17.153 --> 01:24:19.575]  In fact, I should have asked if you wanted people to lift your wife up in prayer.
[01:24:19.575 --> 01:24:23.479]  She's a great lady, and she's a great patriot, and she stood by you so strong.
[01:24:23.479 --> 01:24:27.022]  And so, again, tell everybody a little bit about your wife.
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.982]  Well, as you know, she's a Cuban-American.
[01:24:31.982 --> 01:24:45.790]  Her father was, you know, was a diplomat under Batista who fled his home country, was fiercely anti-communist, anti-Castro, a great man in his own right.
[01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:48.712]  He lost everything in the revolution.
[01:24:48.712 --> 01:24:50.493]  And she has been my rock.
[01:24:50.493 --> 01:24:51.754]  She has been steadfast.
[01:24:52.907 --> 01:24:56.931]  This came as kind of a surprise to us.
[01:24:56.931 --> 01:25:09.125]  She'd be very upset if I got into the details of her physical condition on InfoWars, but other than to say she's going to be fine, the doctors are very pleased with how her surgery has gone.
[01:25:09.125 --> 01:25:11.347]  She'll be out here shortly.
[01:25:11.347 --> 01:25:13.630]  Let's get to the story of the day.
[01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:41.117]  I was very forthright yesterday when I said that having come up completely empty-handed when it comes to Russian collusion, having come up empty-handed when it comes to any trafficking of allegedly hacked emails with WikiLeaks, having come up empty-handed with the bogus claim that I knew about the publication of John Podesta's emails,
[01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:52.468]  The government now, quite conceivably, will conjure up some other bogus offense against me because I appear on InfoWars.
[01:25:52.468 --> 01:25:55.670]  Because I'm, like you, the tip of the spear.
[01:25:55.670 --> 01:25:59.252]  And because we've been taking these people on and we won't be silenced.
[01:25:59.252 --> 01:26:00.272]  We won't shut up.
[01:26:00.272 --> 01:26:05.735]  Well, Roger, you were the first person to say Trump must go after him for illegal spying on the campaign.
[01:26:05.735 --> 01:26:06.716]  How did you know that?
[01:26:06.716 --> 01:26:07.936]  It's all been confirmed since.
[01:26:07.936 --> 01:26:09.197]  You've been absolutely on target.
[01:26:10.526 --> 01:26:27.079]  Well, that New York Times story of January 20th, New York Times, page one, I was with you that day when the bomb hit, saying that Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page had been under FISA surveillance, rocked my world.
[01:26:27.079 --> 01:26:30.481]  Because, as you know, Alex, a U.S.
[01:26:30.481 --> 01:26:35.025]  citizen can only be surveilled under a FISA warrant if they're involved in
[01:26:36.002 --> 01:26:42.903]  Spionage against the United States for a foreign power, which I most definitely have never been.
[01:26:42.903 --> 01:26:46.744]  So this is an illicit spying operation.
[01:26:46.744 --> 01:27:04.208]  We at Infowars were really kind of concurrent with the Daily Caller, the first to report about the role of Stefan Halper, a longtime Bush hand and deep state operative who was planting evidence of Russian collusion
[01:27:04.974 --> 01:27:05.414]  I think so.
[01:27:21.784 --> 01:27:30.729]  Meanwhile, a high-level aide to the President told me on Friday that economic growth is projected to be 4% in the next quarter.
[01:27:30.729 --> 01:27:31.550]  That's incredible.
[01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:33.070]  They said that couldn't be done.
[01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:35.892]  It was structurally impossible, they said.
[01:27:35.892 --> 01:27:40.615]  The President will never be stronger than he is at this instant.
[01:27:40.615 --> 01:27:45.878]  It is time for him to order the release of all these alleged documents.
[01:27:45.878 --> 01:27:46.438]  You notice
[01:27:47.444 --> 01:27:57.135]  Alex, in the wake of the Stefan Halper thing, how the intelligence services say, oh, we can't confirm this because it will expose our methods and it will risk lives.
[01:27:57.135 --> 01:27:59.338]  Well, no lives are being risked.
[01:27:59.338 --> 01:28:04.504]  And their methods need to be exposed because they're unconstitutional and they're illegal.
[01:28:06.832 --> 01:28:14.338]  It's incredible though, everything you said, everything I said, all of it confirmed, absolutely on target, and they're just apoplectic.
[01:28:14.338 --> 01:28:26.328]  All the late night shows that made fun of Trump about the wiretapping claims, you've been saying since day one, since the day he was sworn in, that this would be bigger than Watergate, and that if we pushed it, it would bring down the entire deep state.
[01:28:26.328 --> 01:28:30.732]  Because once this is brought down, they won't be able to pull this stuff off, no matter who it is.
[01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:31.853]  In the future.
[01:28:31.853 --> 01:28:33.315]  This is such an exciting thing.
[01:28:33.315 --> 01:28:35.838]  We're praying for your great wife, great lady.
[01:28:35.838 --> 01:28:37.059]  We'll talk to you again, Rogers.
[01:28:37.059 --> 01:28:37.740]  Things unfold.
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.562]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:39.562 --> 01:28:44.848]  Alex, I'm going to try to get out of the hospital in time to do the war room today at 5 o'clock Eastern.
[01:28:44.848 --> 01:28:48.192]  And I'll be able to issue an update at that time.
[01:28:48.192 --> 01:28:48.413]  All right.
[01:28:48.413 --> 01:28:48.993]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:48.993 --> 01:28:49.774]  Here goes Roger Stone.
[01:28:49.774 --> 01:28:50.115]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.401 --> 01:29:00.443]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:29:00.443 --> 01:29:04.425]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[01:29:04.425 --> 01:29:05.686]  The Bug-A-Salt.
[01:29:05.686 --> 01:29:10.628]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[01:29:10.628 --> 01:29:12.649]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.

[01:29:27.177 --> 01:29:31.040]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.044]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:36.044 --> 01:29:40.868]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.868 --> 01:29:42.209]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:29:47.353 --> 01:29:47.893]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.893 --> 01:29:50.195]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.257 --> 01:30:05.882]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:30:05.882 --> 01:30:13.807]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:30:13.807 --> 01:30:16.889]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:30:17.529 --> 01:30:22.174]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:30:22.174 --> 01:30:26.317]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:30:26.317 --> 01:30:29.460]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:34.225]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:30:34.225 --> 01:30:37.248]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:30:37.668 --> 01:30:52.766]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:30:52.766 --> 01:30:54.307]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.307 --> 01:30:56.610]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:58.072 --> 01:31:02.055]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.055 --> 01:31:04.798]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:31:04.798 --> 01:31:09.622]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:31:09.622 --> 01:31:12.024]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[01:31:57.663 --> 01:31:59.324]  Pike and Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:31:59.324 --> 01:31:59.604]  Go ahead.
[01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:02.770]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:13.273]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:32:13.273 --> 01:32:16.654]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:32:17.194 --> 01:32:17.534]  Thank you.
[01:32:17.534 --> 01:32:17.874]  Absolutely.
[01:32:39.526 --> 01:33:01.330]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:04.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.355 --> 01:33:21.977]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:21.977 --> 01:33:28.341]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:28.341 --> 01:33:48.456]  Alright, I've just spent an hour and a half of air time getting into the fact that a permanent deep state of Democrats and NSA, CIA, and FBI officials who've been in power for decades and committed incredible crimes selling the country out to Communist China
[01:33:49.514 --> 01:34:03.480]  Russia, the EU, you name it, did spy on Trump, found nothing, spied on Trump illegally, then lied to the public, lied to Congress about it.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.680]  Now they've been caught.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.741]  Now Trump's going after them for it.
[01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.903]  Now there's a criminal investigation.
[01:34:09.903 --> 01:34:14.124]  We've all been totally vindicated.
[01:34:14.124 --> 01:34:17.506]  Nunes has been vindicated and there's almost no coverage of this.
[01:34:18.746 --> 01:34:19.806]  Even on Fox News.
[01:34:19.806 --> 01:34:22.987]  It's mainly this Texas shooting.
[01:34:22.987 --> 01:34:24.147]  Which is a tragic event.
[01:34:24.147 --> 01:34:28.248]  Our own Owen Schroer was down there with our crew.
[01:34:28.248 --> 01:34:30.249]  The vast majority of people are pro-gun.
[01:34:30.249 --> 01:34:31.929]  They understand that it's an evil problem.
[01:34:31.929 --> 01:34:35.270]  It's a mental illness problem.
[01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:45.433]  They're saying that the Lieutenant Governor's wrong to say that we should have armed guards at school or that we should have less entrances to stop these type of events because mad dog killers know
[01:34:47.938 --> 01:35:01.681]  That they can go to a school and generally not face any resistance, and then a large group of unarmed people are there, and the media hypes these school shootings like it's the thing to do.
[01:35:01.681 --> 01:35:11.823]  And Dana Lash really got it right this weekend when she said that the media hyping this is the biggest contributor.
[01:35:11.823 --> 01:35:13.583]  They're almost always into devil worship.
[01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:16.224]  They're almost always on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:35:16.224 --> 01:35:17.404]  They're almost always
[01:35:19.215 --> 01:35:27.058]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:35:27.058 --> 01:35:29.299]  I'm not saying bans shooting up video games.
[01:35:29.299 --> 01:35:35.662]  But they were created for the military so that people wouldn't hesitate when it came to shooting somebody up close.
[01:35:35.662 --> 01:35:41.364]  Because in Vietnam, about half the people up close wouldn't shoot somebody.
[01:35:41.364 --> 01:35:45.886]  Or if they had them in their crosshairs far away, they'd hesitate.
[01:35:45.886 --> 01:35:48.867]  So they started developing what became video games.
[01:35:51.107 --> 01:36:01.091]  So you have all this MO, but then you add the final catalyst, the media giving it all of that attention, and that's what's contributing to it.
[01:36:01.091 --> 01:36:07.493]  We had gang shootings and some shootings at schools previous to what happened at Columbine.
[01:36:07.493 --> 01:36:16.397]  But once Columbine happened, and the media turned it into the number one circus and cover school shootings every day, even when they're not happening for six months or so,
[01:36:17.881 --> 01:36:19.883]  Then mentally ill people get it in their head.
[01:36:19.883 --> 01:36:22.004]  Then they start the training at the schools.
[01:36:22.004 --> 01:36:23.385]  Then they start the active shooter.
[01:36:23.385 --> 01:36:25.267]  Then they start the drills.
[01:36:25.267 --> 01:36:27.769]  They'd had two drills at this school in the month before.
[01:36:27.769 --> 01:36:31.591]  They'd had multiple drills in Parkland.
[01:36:31.591 --> 01:36:36.115]  And the police stood down there.
[01:36:36.115 --> 01:36:39.577]  And so, it is creating this atmosphere.
[01:36:39.577 --> 01:36:42.800]  And I make this point, but no one else makes it.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.723]  I'm very thankful that Dana Lash is now making that point.
[01:36:48.277 --> 01:37:05.067]  Because when they had a, again, death education, which was really suicide education, started in 1989, in pilot schools across the country, they saw a doubling and then a tripling within a couple years of people committing suicide.
[01:37:06.417 --> 01:37:08.497]  A doubling in boys, a tripling in girls.
[01:37:08.497 --> 01:37:13.279]  There was even a 2020 ABC news piece about it and they scaled it back.
[01:37:13.279 --> 01:37:20.400]  It was weird liberal socialist brainwashing to create anxiety, to create mental patients.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.201]  The developers know what they're doing, the teachers don't know in the health class.
[01:37:25.201 --> 01:37:27.542]  They put them in coffins, roll them up in
[01:37:31.024 --> 01:37:32.225]  Carpets.
[01:37:32.225 --> 01:37:33.347]  Lock them in lockers.
[01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:34.628]  It's a form of torture.
[01:37:34.628 --> 01:37:36.531]  And tell them, think about death.
[01:37:36.531 --> 01:37:44.100]  Here's how people commit suicide with a shoelace tied around the hat rack or the clothes rack on the back of the stall.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:45.361]  The clothes hook.
[01:37:45.361 --> 01:37:50.167]  And little girls, 12, 13, would go kill themselves right after class.
[01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:50.928]  They'd get depressed.
[01:37:51.988 --> 01:37:55.811]  About a boyfriend, or about mom or dad, or about not being on the cheerleader squad.
[01:37:55.811 --> 01:38:01.314]  And instead of just going home and crying, they were emotional, they were taught a quick and easy way to kill themselves.
[01:38:01.314 --> 01:38:04.776]  Even though they weren't serious about it, five seconds, they passed out.
[01:38:04.776 --> 01:38:05.817]  Bye bye!
[01:38:05.817 --> 01:38:07.838]  Bloated, purple head, dead.
[01:38:07.838 --> 01:38:09.399]  Another globalist victory.
[01:38:09.399 --> 01:38:17.285]  Because you take devastating psychological warfare techniques like that, and you deploy that into schools, it's well known.
[01:38:17.285 --> 01:38:20.146]  In fact, there was a well-known
[01:38:22.728 --> 01:38:26.089]  Sympathy Suicide Syndrome.
[01:38:26.089 --> 01:38:28.290]  There's different names for it.
[01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:37.993]  But they noticed hundreds of years ago that they would do William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, sometimes to large crowds, particularly outdoors.
[01:38:37.993 --> 01:38:45.475]  And if they really pulled it off, some women would go commit suicide that night.
[01:38:45.475 --> 01:38:49.396]  Because they were so in love with the story of Romeo and Juliet, they wanted to join them.
[01:38:52.523 --> 01:38:56.426]  There it is, USA Today.
[01:38:56.426 --> 01:38:58.508]  Last year, youth suicide rates are rising.
[01:38:58.508 --> 01:39:02.352]  School and the internet may be to blame.
[01:39:02.352 --> 01:39:07.236]  Screen time, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, death education.
[01:39:07.236 --> 01:39:10.079]  It was well known that the drug program increased.
[01:39:10.079 --> 01:39:12.501]  The whole DARE program increased drug use.
[01:39:14.187 --> 01:39:18.308]  It doubled drug use just a few years after it was in the news.
[01:39:18.308 --> 01:39:20.389]  And they go, we don't know why we're doing the D.A.R.E.
[01:39:20.389 --> 01:39:22.970]  program and drug use has exploded.
[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:28.892]  Some think it's introducing drugs to young people.
[01:39:28.892 --> 01:39:34.273]  Now, I'm all for sex education to know about diseases and the reproductive tract, but that's not what it really is.
[01:39:34.273 --> 01:39:35.754]  It was a way to teach young people about
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:45.224]  Unnatural sex acts, to introduce them to other forms of sex, to introduce homosexuality, promiscuity, that's now declassified.
[01:39:45.224 --> 01:39:48.885]  And it caused that.
[01:39:48.885 --> 01:39:53.387]  Sex education caused promiscuity to explode as well.
[01:39:53.387 --> 01:39:56.189]  Drug education makes drug use explode.
[01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:58.970]  Suicide education makes suicide explode.
[01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:01.071]  Sex education makes sex explode.
[01:40:03.484 --> 01:40:05.044]  If it's not real sex education.
[01:40:05.044 --> 01:40:12.266]  You show somebody diseases, syphilis, gonorrhea, you show them some, the old stuff they showed them did not increase it.
[01:40:12.266 --> 01:40:14.147]  Stuff in the 50s and 60s did not.
[01:40:14.147 --> 01:40:20.169]  But after that, 70s, 80s, boom, it just is how to have sex.
[01:40:20.169 --> 01:40:31.892]  Children as young as six years of age under some liberal area school districts are taught things I didn't know about till I read about them in the newspaper when I was like 25 years old as a talk show host.
[01:40:32.614 --> 01:40:34.375]  I was like, what's that they're teaching them?
[01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:38.498]  And I had to go look it up.
[01:40:38.498 --> 01:40:40.440]  I didn't know what eating feces was.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.242]  I didn't even know people did that.
[01:40:43.242 --> 01:40:49.446]  They teach six-year-olds how much fun it is.
[01:40:49.446 --> 01:40:53.069]  And stuff I can't even say on air.
[01:40:53.069 --> 01:40:54.210]  I remember reading these articles.
[01:40:54.210 --> 01:40:55.491]  I'm like, this isn't real.
[01:40:55.491 --> 01:41:01.215]  And then they'd have teachers on the news defending it!
[01:41:01.215 --> 01:41:01.375]  So.
[01:41:02.898 --> 01:41:04.198]  You have shooting drills.
[01:41:04.198 --> 01:41:05.839]  You hype shooters are coming.
[01:41:05.839 --> 01:41:09.260]  That goes on.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.261]  People get the idea in their head.
[01:41:11.261 --> 01:41:15.502]  And once the idea is in crazy people's head, Katy bar the door.
[01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:16.603]  Then they want the infamy.
[01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:17.943]  Then they want to be known.
[01:41:17.943 --> 01:41:19.043]  Then they want to be famous.
[01:41:19.043 --> 01:41:20.804]  They want to be somebody.
[01:41:20.804 --> 01:41:24.585]  And it's off the races in this sick, narcissistic culture.
[01:41:24.585 --> 01:41:26.326]  So if somebody's wearing a devil-worshipping outfit,
[01:41:27.369 --> 01:41:29.310]  I don't mean an Iron Maiden shirt or something.
[01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:39.457]  I mean, if they're wearing a Nazi-style outfit with communist symbols and skulls and death, and they're into guns, and they're loners, that's who you gotta watch.
[01:41:39.457 --> 01:41:41.099]  They play shoot-'em-up video games?
[01:41:41.099 --> 01:41:42.760]  Wow, you really gotta watch them.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.481]  Here's Dana Lash talking about it.
[01:41:47.233 --> 01:42:00.583]  And I was reading about this study, these numerous studies, and in fact, they went back and they noticed that all of these school shooters had one, well, had several commonalities, but one in particular stood out.
[01:42:00.583 --> 01:42:10.991]  Every single one of them was motivated, and every single one of them had at some point, either in writings that were discovered at their home, in social media or something, they had in some way referenced Colin Vine.
[01:42:11.852 --> 01:42:14.053]  Which was a motivating factor.
[01:42:14.053 --> 01:42:20.015]  The media has got to stop creating more of these monsters by over-saturation.
[01:42:20.015 --> 01:42:24.196]  I'm not saying don't responsibly report on things as they happen.
[01:42:24.196 --> 01:42:25.637]  Look, I understand it.
[01:42:25.637 --> 01:42:31.159]  But constantly showing the image of the murderer, constantly saying their name, is completely unnecessary.
[01:42:31.159 --> 01:42:39.882]  I understand if you want to report it once they've been identified, but after that, according to what these studies have shown, we need to be very cognizant of what this creates.
[01:42:41.493 --> 01:42:43.335]  Total Veritas.
[01:42:43.335 --> 01:42:43.876]  Bingo.
[01:42:43.876 --> 01:42:44.336]  Bingo.
[01:42:44.336 --> 01:42:44.797]  Bingo.
[01:42:44.797 --> 01:42:45.577]  Bingo.
[01:42:45.577 --> 01:42:46.278]  That's it.
[01:42:46.278 --> 01:42:47.059]  That's it.
[01:42:47.059 --> 01:42:48.300]  That's it.
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:49.242]  That's what's happening.
[01:42:49.242 --> 01:42:50.223]  That's the truth.
[01:42:50.223 --> 01:42:53.266]  And the media knows full well what it's doing.
[01:42:53.266 --> 01:42:55.729]  They've been hyping up Parkland hoping for this.
[01:42:58.041 --> 01:43:02.745]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:46:52.379 --> 01:46:55.160]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.124 --> 01:47:40.050]  Regrets, I've had a few But then again, too few to mention I did what I had to do Saw it through without exemption I planned each charted course
[01:47:41.485 --> 01:47:48.308]  Look at DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:47:48.308 --> 01:47:51.429]  We are hammering that
[01:48:10.865 --> 01:48:18.229]  Trump has launched a criminal investigation into Hillary and Obama spying on his campaign and then lying about it to Congress.
[01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:21.110]  This is thousands of times bigger than Watergate.
[01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:22.071]  This is seismic.
[01:48:22.071 --> 01:48:29.715]  This is the entire illegal spy grid, the Big Brother system, all of it in a civil war.
[01:48:29.715 --> 01:48:32.236]  And the media caught doubling down the lies.
[01:48:32.236 --> 01:48:36.418]  This will destroy whatever credibility they had left.
[01:48:36.418 --> 01:48:39.680]  This will bring them all down and Trump is winning.
[01:48:41.277 --> 01:48:44.639]  And you gotta go to DrudgeReport.com to find it.
[01:48:44.639 --> 01:48:46.159]  Or InfoWars.com.
[01:48:46.159 --> 01:48:49.521]  But Drudge has it all nicely laid out in the left-hand corner.
[01:48:49.521 --> 01:48:52.502]  Trump rips Brennan.
[01:48:52.502 --> 01:48:54.683]  Spy spooked.
[01:48:54.683 --> 01:49:00.746]  Ex-CIA Chief warns McConnell and Ryan.
[01:49:00.746 --> 01:49:02.907]  PN says, Deep State desperate.
[01:49:02.907 --> 01:49:04.128]  That's absolutely true.
[01:49:04.128 --> 01:49:06.489]  Ted Olson, constitutional crisis brewing.
[01:49:06.489 --> 01:49:07.970]  Rudy, it will be over by September 1st.
[01:49:09.639 --> 01:49:12.940]  Tobin dims civil war over impeachment.
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:18.423]  Watchdog default FBI for Clinton probe.
[01:49:18.423 --> 01:49:20.183]  There is a criminal investigation.
[01:49:20.183 --> 01:49:21.064]  They've been caught.
[01:49:21.064 --> 01:49:22.444]  It's been blown wide open.
[01:49:22.444 --> 01:49:28.907]  The FBI now admits that they had a major operation and they've named it against Trump during the campaign.
[01:49:28.907 --> 01:49:31.808]  It's huge!
[01:49:31.808 --> 01:49:36.210]  Because until now they've been denying it and lying about it and lying to Congress.
[01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:36.950]  It's massive!
[01:49:39.346 --> 01:49:47.474]  Meanwhile, the Pope says it's okay to be gay.
[01:49:47.474 --> 01:49:49.716]  God made you like this.
[01:49:49.716 --> 01:50:01.028]  There's an article up on Infowars.com that Kit Daniels put out getting into the fact that the man he's telling this to was abused as a child.
[01:50:04.019 --> 01:50:06.260]  And so the Pope's using that as a backdrop.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.661]  Is it okay to be a pedophile?
[01:50:07.661 --> 01:50:22.330]  Because your deputy Pope, your right-hand man, just got indicted and is in a secret trial in Australia for reportedly abusing over a hundred young boys.
[01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:25.873]  Some young is five years old.
[01:50:25.873 --> 01:50:31.276]  So the Pope wants to hide behind a rainbow flag.
[01:50:33.450 --> 01:50:34.911]  I had the Kit Daniels article.
[01:50:34.911 --> 01:50:38.452]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:50:38.452 --> 01:50:40.173]  We can just punch that up.
[01:50:40.173 --> 01:50:42.554]  I'll just go to Infowars myself.
[01:50:42.554 --> 01:50:44.715]  I've got so many papers.
[01:50:44.715 --> 01:50:47.236]  Sometimes it just drives me crazy.
[01:50:47.236 --> 01:50:49.897]  There's so many.
[01:50:49.897 --> 01:51:02.163]  There's another big one that's super important that I haven't gotten to that just seismically shows how weak the globalists are and that's that
[01:51:04.289 --> 01:51:14.877]  Obama is pleading with Jay-Z to keep other hip-hop stars from ever meeting with Trump, trying to isolate Trump.
[01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:17.719]  But it's not working.
[01:51:17.719 --> 01:51:21.582]  So he wants Jay-Z to go organize everybody, because just Jay-Z
[01:51:25.686 --> 01:51:29.529]  Alone not going to the White House does nothing but getting hundreds of people not to.
[01:51:29.529 --> 01:51:40.857]  Obama hopes will stop the trend where when Kanye valiantly stood up for the truth, Trump saw his ratings with black males double in polls.
[01:51:40.857 --> 01:51:42.178]  That scares Obama.
[01:51:43.735 --> 01:51:45.876]  He wants to own those folks.
[01:51:45.876 --> 01:51:48.317]  And they're starting to wake up, and that scares them.
[01:51:48.317 --> 01:51:50.858]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:51:50.858 --> 01:51:52.258]  It's absolutely critical.
[01:51:52.258 --> 01:51:54.239]  But look at the creepy photo of the Pope.
[01:51:54.239 --> 01:52:00.682]  Pope tells molestation victim it's okay to be gay.
[01:52:00.682 --> 01:52:02.202]  And that's what this is really all about.
[01:52:02.202 --> 01:52:08.185]  And notice you had this so-called expert come out a few weeks ago.
[01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:15.011]  And say, oh, if you're changing your baby's diaper, ask permission, or it's sexual assault.
[01:52:15.011 --> 01:52:24.494]  The left and NAMBLA and others want it to be a system where they say children can give consent.
[01:52:24.494 --> 01:52:28.375]  So you're thinking, wow, you're making it bad to change a baby's diaper like you're a pervert.
[01:52:28.375 --> 01:52:29.675]  That shows how sick your mind is.
[01:52:29.675 --> 01:52:30.796]  Uh-uh.
[01:52:30.796 --> 01:52:37.338]  The real agenda behind this, I'm not sure this lady even knows this, is
[01:52:38.513 --> 01:52:43.378]  To make it where children can give consent to have sex.
[01:52:43.378 --> 01:52:47.181]  And so that's why they need consent to have their diaper changed.
[01:52:47.181 --> 01:52:50.444]  Now there's the headline.
[01:52:50.444 --> 01:52:55.049]  Parents should ask their baby's permission before changing dirty nappy.
[01:52:55.049 --> 01:52:56.450]  Sexuality expert says.
[01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:58.432]  So the idea is being a parent's dirty and bad.
[01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:15.686]  But there's not going to be any worry in the leftist publications about the devil pope and his main adjunct, his attache, his aide-de-camp, his right-hand man, being the main procurer for the whole blackmail network of little boys in the Vatican.
[01:53:15.686 --> 01:53:18.588]  And just look at that pervert pope right there.
[01:53:18.588 --> 01:53:19.790]  You know it's going to come out on him.
[01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:21.531]  He's talking about resigning any time.
[01:53:21.531 --> 01:53:24.034]  So he's doing some leftist shots over the bow.
[01:53:25.450 --> 01:53:32.255]  It's worth pointing out that Pope Francis was talking to a victim of Catholic sexual abuse when he reportedly told him it's okay to be gay.
[01:53:33.308 --> 01:53:34.448]  Why it matters.
[01:53:34.448 --> 01:53:38.589]  The context of the Pope's alleged statement is being overshadowed by the statement itself.
[01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:47.370]  The context, however, is important because it sheds light on the decades-long molestation accusations against Catholic priests, many of which turned out to be true.
[01:53:47.370 --> 01:53:51.571]  It also sheds light on why the Pontiff is motivated to drift away from traditional Catholic teachings.
[01:53:51.571 --> 01:53:54.852]  The Pope's statement isn't just about homosexuality versus the Church.
[01:53:54.852 --> 01:54:01.833]  Pope Francis is an inherent liberation theology prominent Latin American socialist for decades, with the end goal of destroying the Church from within.
[01:54:03.339 --> 01:54:09.583]  And when they tell people that they've been molested, don't worry, you haven't sinned turning it on to them like they did something wrong.
[01:54:09.583 --> 01:54:12.024]  Don't worry, I forgive you that you got molested.
[01:54:12.024 --> 01:54:15.226]  What she's really saying is it's okay, you got molested.
[01:54:15.226 --> 01:54:17.627]  See that alchemy?
[01:54:17.627 --> 01:54:21.950]  Very, very sick.
[01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:23.751]  And then it goes into all the context of it.
[01:54:31.752 --> 01:54:33.173]  That's what they're pushing.
[01:54:33.173 --> 01:54:35.473]  That's what the Pope's doing.
[01:54:35.473 --> 01:54:50.219]  And this man's best buddy is in a trial, a secret trial, because he's so powerful, about a hundred plus boys kidnapped and trafficked to men in the Catholic Church, which has turned into the pedophile command base.
[01:54:50.219 --> 01:54:54.600]  It's its own government, its own system operating however it sees fit.
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:58.522]  So that's the reality that we're dealing with here.
[01:54:58.522 --> 01:54:58.662]  Now,
[01:55:01.035 --> 01:55:03.337]  We're going to start the next hour.
[01:55:03.337 --> 01:55:06.899]  Had a really interesting guest on who I've been following for years, but I want to get him back on.
[01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:17.886]  Vox Day to come on and cover some really, really big issues here on air and how big a deal it is that we see this whole situation unfolding with the beginning of the fall of the deep state.
[01:55:17.886 --> 01:55:19.647]  I mean, this is really powerful.
[01:55:19.647 --> 01:55:21.068]  This is really dangerous.
[01:55:21.068 --> 01:55:23.310]  This is a critical juncture point.
[01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:28.053]  Who knows how they're going to try to strike back right now, but this is quite a time
[01:55:29.977 --> 01:55:33.059]  Quite a time to be alive.
[01:55:33.059 --> 01:55:36.760]  So we are at that point of no return.
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:38.741]  The globalists are going to be defeated.
[01:55:38.741 --> 01:55:41.923]  But we're not sure how serious this is going to get before it's over.
[01:55:41.923 --> 01:55:45.885]  We are in the thick of battle right now.
[01:55:45.885 --> 01:55:50.047]  We will cover all of that coming up in the third hour today.
[01:55:50.047 --> 01:55:52.288]  Also going to take a lot of phone calls coming up throughout the week.
[01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:57.753]  We have Ron Paul joining us, a lot of other very informative guests that stay with us throughout the week.
[01:55:57.753 --> 01:56:01.176]  And don't forget the War Room with Owen Schroeder, three o'clock every day.
[01:56:01.176 --> 01:56:02.637]  And Roger Stone's popping in on that.
[01:56:02.637 --> 01:56:06.280]  You've also got David Knight in the morning with the Real News, doing a great job.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:11.844]  There's a lot of other stuff I want to get to here coming up.
[01:56:11.844 --> 01:56:14.526]  But before I do that, please remember the broadcast.
[01:56:14.526 --> 01:56:19.649]  Please remember the globalists are fighting as hard as they can to try to shut down free speech.
[01:56:20.486 --> 01:56:29.468]  You try to destroy InfoWars as an example of everybody, and when you purchase the products, and when you support us, we're going to be able to expand and go 24 hours a day.
[01:56:29.468 --> 01:56:32.588]  I want to go about 20 hours a day at first.
[01:56:32.588 --> 01:56:37.749]  And we're going to be able to really reach out and find a lot of new affiliates and a lot of new people.
[01:56:37.749 --> 01:56:39.090]  We're going to wake up.
[01:56:39.090 --> 01:56:41.350]  And so this is the second American revolution.
[01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:44.150]  It's going global right now.
[01:56:44.150 --> 01:56:46.171]  And it's the financial support that makes it all possible.
[01:56:46.171 --> 01:56:46.691]  And here's the deal.
[01:56:48.154 --> 01:56:52.420]  We have a huge special that I didn't even know about that somebody came up with.
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:53.642]  It's massive.
[01:56:53.642 --> 01:56:55.164]  X2 is our best-selling product.
[01:56:55.164 --> 01:56:57.808]  Deep Earth.
[01:56:57.808 --> 01:56:59.851]  Good halogen.
[01:56:59.851 --> 01:57:01.334]  Iodine.
[01:57:01.334 --> 01:57:03.397]  It's 25% off even though we're selling out of it.
[01:57:04.514 --> 01:57:06.835]  But you can get it with our Biotruth Selenium.
[01:57:06.835 --> 01:57:09.455]  Pure mustard seeds, super strong selenium.
[01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:11.656]  You talk about energy, stamina, libido.
[01:57:11.656 --> 01:57:12.536]  In fact, I need some.
[01:57:12.536 --> 01:57:17.118]  My bottle ran out at home and I, somebody grabbed me a bottle of Biotruth Selenium.
[01:57:17.118 --> 01:57:18.098]  Thank you.
[01:57:18.098 --> 01:57:20.779]  It is 50% off when you get it together.
[01:57:20.779 --> 01:57:24.080]  So that is a massive discount on both Biotruth Selenium
[01:57:25.455 --> 01:57:29.737]  Biodrew Selenium has a 4.9 review.
[01:57:29.737 --> 01:57:33.438]  The X2 has a 4.9 review as well by Power Reviews.
[01:57:33.438 --> 01:57:36.779]  Never been a better time to try Selenium and True Iodine.
[01:57:36.779 --> 01:57:37.399]  It's all there.
[01:57:37.399 --> 01:57:38.680]  It's a tonic iodine.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.500]  Pure iodine.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:40.761]  Nobody else has got it.
[01:57:40.761 --> 01:57:42.381]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:47.185 --> 01:57:57.772]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.772 --> 01:57:59.834]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:57:59.834 --> 01:58:02.716]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.716 --> 01:58:04.197]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.197 --> 01:58:04.317]  It's
[01:58:04.497 --> 01:58:04.777]  I think?
[01:58:27.944 --> 01:58:39.607]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.607 --> 01:58:42.908]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.908 --> 01:58:46.229]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Field, at Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:55.790]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:55.790 --> 01:59:03.720]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:06.803]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:59:07.424 --> 01:59:12.065]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:59:12.065 --> 01:59:16.206]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:59:16.206 --> 01:59:19.367]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:59:19.367 --> 01:59:24.108]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:59:24.108 --> 01:59:27.209]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:59:27.569 --> 01:59:42.633]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:42.633 --> 01:59:44.173]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.173 --> 01:59:51.715]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:59:51.715 --> 01:59:54.336]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.962 --> 02:00:17.792]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:17.792 --> 02:00:19.074]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:46.776 --> 02:00:48.257]  Right here, hit that accelerator to 200.
[02:00:48.257 --> 02:00:55.823]  That's what I'd like to do right now.
[02:00:55.823 --> 02:00:59.906]  Alright, we're broadcasting worldwide here.
[02:00:59.906 --> 02:01:02.208]  You know, I'm in a really bad mood today.
[02:01:02.208 --> 02:01:05.210]  I'm not gonna lie to viewers and listeners.
[02:01:05.210 --> 02:01:10.234]  I should be in a super good mood, but I am a little bit over
[02:01:11.610 --> 02:01:13.130]  Overflowed when it comes to globalists.
[02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:16.191]  I mean, I don't want to look at the pedophile Pope anymore.
[02:01:16.191 --> 02:01:17.611]  What about you?
[02:01:17.611 --> 02:01:19.332]  Look at that creepazoid.
[02:01:19.332 --> 02:01:24.213]  I don't even want to sit there and look at Nancy Pelosi, all these crazy people.
[02:01:24.213 --> 02:01:26.113]  And of course we're starting to defeat them.
[02:01:26.113 --> 02:01:27.693]  We should defeat them.
[02:01:27.693 --> 02:01:39.296]  We should not allow ourselves to be ruled by this abject scum who's trying to virtue signal about, oh, gay people aren't bad and
[02:01:40.954 --> 02:01:46.775]  Oh, the Earth is no longer the center of the universe.
[02:01:46.775 --> 02:01:49.196]  Like, we need this guy to tell us any of this stuff.
[02:01:49.196 --> 02:01:52.116]  Look at him.
[02:01:52.116 --> 02:01:57.337]  Ah, you are a victim of my people raping you.
[02:01:57.337 --> 02:02:00.658]  It is okay, my son.
[02:02:00.658 --> 02:02:02.398]  Just, can we zoom in on that?
[02:02:02.398 --> 02:02:04.759]  Let's go to Infowars.com.
[02:02:04.759 --> 02:02:06.179]  I mean, look at that Krapozoit.
[02:02:07.441 --> 02:02:15.644]  I mean, would you let Pope Francis keep your five-year-old son for the weekend?
[02:02:15.644 --> 02:02:22.026]  Not unless you wanted him to get diddled.
[02:02:22.026 --> 02:02:25.147]  You know for a fact that that is a piranha.
[02:02:25.147 --> 02:02:29.369]  That is a demon-possessed creature.
[02:02:29.369 --> 02:02:35.451]  Pope Francis is as close to Satan as you're going to get on this earth, in the flesh.
[02:02:36.897 --> 02:02:40.258]  Off of what he does, how he behaves.
[02:02:40.258 --> 02:02:46.200]  He used pedophilia to take over the Catholic Church and get rid of the family system and the good things it had.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:52.082]  And it's taken a hundred years for the pedophiles to take control of the Catholic Church, and now they've done it.
[02:02:52.082 --> 02:02:54.083]  And now he's gonna hide behind a rainbow flag.
[02:02:54.083 --> 02:03:01.425]  Everybody's gonna go, oh, you're not against gay people!
[02:03:01.425 --> 02:03:02.826]  As they segue into that.
[02:03:02.826 --> 02:03:03.906]  That's the Nambla
[02:03:05.427 --> 02:03:05.947]  Creed.
[02:03:05.947 --> 02:03:11.030]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the real head of NAMBLA is Pope Francis.
[02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:12.611]  And notice, I'm baiting the media.
[02:03:12.611 --> 02:03:21.757]  I dare the whore globalist media that the Pope rides around on the back of.
[02:03:21.757 --> 02:03:24.519]  The great whore of Babylon.
[02:03:24.519 --> 02:03:26.580]  I dare you to even run my story.
[02:03:28.066 --> 02:03:28.506]  Pick it up!
[02:03:28.506 --> 02:03:53.880]  You think it'll hurt me if people read Alex Jones says the Pope looks like a big old degenerate pedophile out of Central Casting and his attache, his right-hand man, his aide-de-camp, his best friend is in jail right now being tried for trafficking over a hundred little boys over decades?
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.342]  Why the Cardinal Pell case has to be so secretive, New York Times?
[02:03:58.797 --> 02:04:03.739]  Imagine you're a six-year-old, seven-year-old boy, and the door opens, and here comes Cardinal Pell.
[02:04:03.739 --> 02:04:06.000]  That big ol' potbelly hangin' out.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.322]  He's porky-piggin' it.
[02:04:09.322 --> 02:04:15.765]  And you're gonna beg for Mama, and Mama ain't gonna come, and then in comes the door.
[02:04:15.765 --> 02:04:25.149]  In comes Pope Francis, the Jesuit, New World Order kingpin to destroy the Catholic Church, and he's got his Georgetown suing me.
[02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:33.449]  And you morons couldn't even do a half-decent filing, you had to withdraw it.
[02:04:33.449 --> 02:04:43.513]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[02:04:43.513 --> 02:04:45.874]  Vengeance is coming!
[02:04:45.874 --> 02:04:48.495]  Fire is coming, Pope!
[02:04:48.495 --> 02:04:53.617]  The real revolution against you is coming, and you will burn in hell!
[02:04:56.544 --> 02:04:58.865]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[02:04:58.865 --> 02:05:04.648]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[02:05:54.493 --> 02:06:10.202]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:29.056 --> 02:06:32.319]  I didn't judge you at all wrong.
[02:06:32.319 --> 02:06:38.324]  And we decided we'd shut up and sing the song.
[02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:42.907]  Until I had to renew the Constitution.
[02:06:42.907 --> 02:06:46.350]  Take a bow for the new revolution.
[02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:50.914]  It's not in me to change all around.
[02:06:50.914 --> 02:06:53.276]  Pick up my guitar and play.
[02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:16.152]  Matt Bracken always does a great job.
[02:07:16.152 --> 02:07:19.555]  Former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, getting into the whole school shooting.
[02:07:19.555 --> 02:07:21.557]  Some of the interesting areas to look at that.
[02:07:21.557 --> 02:07:23.499]  The tragedy, our prayers go out to everybody.
[02:07:23.499 --> 02:07:24.981]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:07:24.981 --> 02:07:29.105]  Fox Day joins us right now to cover the waterfront.
[02:07:29.105 --> 02:07:33.329]  He's the best-selling author of FJW is Always Live, FJW is Always Double Down.
[02:07:35.934 --> 02:07:58.282]  And he wants to get into the whole Stefan Halperin situation, and how bombshell that is, and how that's shaking the world that indeed there was an illegal FBI mole from the CIA inside the Trump campaign, not to find Russian collusion, but to try to basically get it going, but didn't happen.
[02:07:58.282 --> 02:08:01.963]  And how the media lied, and how there's a criminal investigation now.
[02:08:03.908 --> 02:08:16.592]  Going on by the Inspector General, the only part of the Justice Department not controlled by the rogue operative Jeff Sessions, the most dangerous man in America.
[02:08:16.592 --> 02:08:28.877]  You can speculate all day if he's senile, why he's compromised, why he's not doing his job, how they let Rosenstein sign documents giving himself control of everything, how this rogue group is operating, but a lot of people early on
[02:08:30.151 --> 02:08:33.052]  When Trump was first elected, we're hedging their bets.
[02:08:33.052 --> 02:08:36.314]  They really thought there was all this Russian collusion evidence.
[02:08:36.314 --> 02:08:41.896]  They were told by Obama, and I believe Sessions was, but we know the New York Times was.
[02:08:41.896 --> 02:08:44.037]  We've got evidence Trump is a Russian agent.
[02:08:44.037 --> 02:08:52.220]  We've got evidence of him being urinated on and all this other stuff, and they believed it, so they hedged their bet.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:55.582]  They took the appointments, they hedged their bets, but were told, you'll be okay.
[02:08:57.870 --> 02:09:07.789]  And now that the Democrats are being exposed, they're at their most dangerous point because they are in full panic mode as everything we broke down, everything we laid out has come true.
[02:09:08.823 --> 02:09:11.525]  So Vox Day joins us.
[02:09:11.525 --> 02:09:13.566]  And you know, we just had Vox on.
[02:09:13.566 --> 02:09:17.749]  I'm only attacking Ben Shapiro because he tells people not to come on my show.
[02:09:17.749 --> 02:09:23.312]  He's trying to take over the remnants of Glenn Beck's imploded operation in Dallas.
[02:09:23.312 --> 02:09:28.556]  He's constantly here in Texas, siphoning money from Texas billionaires to fund himself.
[02:09:28.556 --> 02:09:30.417]  He's not a self-made man.
[02:09:30.417 --> 02:09:32.338]  And he was an ever-Trumper.
[02:09:32.338 --> 02:09:33.179]  And he's a globalist.
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:38.501]  And now he's in the news defending the illegal spying on Trump.
[02:09:38.501 --> 02:09:46.582]  So he's a small footnote, but I mean, with friends like Ben Shapiro, you don't need globalists, you don't need Democrats.
[02:09:46.582 --> 02:09:56.444]  That's all I'm saying is, he's been set up, they think, as this anointed one, you know, to tell all the Christians and conservatives how we're supposed to, you know, wipe our noses.
[02:09:56.444 --> 02:10:01.945]  And he's very leftist, how he tries to police everybody and say who can go on what shows and what language to use.
[02:10:04.005 --> 02:10:05.365]  There it is.
[02:10:05.365 --> 02:10:11.927]  Ben Shapiro, Dependents, FBI, Deep State, Inside Trump Campaign.
[02:10:11.927 --> 02:10:15.788]  Which, of course, he said was never happening and I was wrong and I was crazy.
[02:10:15.788 --> 02:10:16.728]  It's all confirmed.
[02:10:16.728 --> 02:10:19.309]  So Vox Day joins us.
[02:10:19.309 --> 02:10:23.130]  Vox, good to have you back on the broadcast with us.
[02:10:23.130 --> 02:10:25.971]  You're also launching your new
[02:10:28.117 --> 02:10:31.261]  Your whole new system here pretty soon.
[02:10:31.261 --> 02:10:32.502]  A new comic book.
[02:10:32.502 --> 02:10:38.109]  And so we're gonna be breaking all that down as well as soon as we get Vox on the line.
[02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:46.698]  But before I go any further, why not, before we get into all that here today, tell you that we have the biggest special ever.
[02:10:47.964 --> 02:10:50.266]  On bio-true selenium.
[02:10:50.266 --> 02:10:54.109]  That's bio-true selenium, ladies and gentlemen, from Infowarslife.com.
[02:10:54.109 --> 02:11:00.394]  And if you don't know about selenium, you have to have it electrochemically in all processes in the body.
[02:11:00.394 --> 02:11:01.975]  And your body's electrochemical.
[02:11:01.975 --> 02:11:05.518]  And there's a lot of synthetic stuff out there that doesn't do anything to your body, reportedly.
[02:11:05.518 --> 02:11:09.982]  We have it from mustard seed, the mighty mustard seed.
[02:11:09.982 --> 02:11:13.585]  And we have it there concentrated, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:15.615 --> 02:11:20.901]  It's a very, very strong formula, and it's available at InfoWarStore.com at 50% off.
[02:11:24.605 --> 02:11:29.228]  When you get it with X2, it's also 50% off.
[02:11:29.228 --> 02:11:38.275]  So X2 is 25% off by itself, but when you get it with biodiesel in the combo, it is 50% off.
[02:11:38.275 --> 02:11:42.338]  The special is going to have to end this week because we're running low on the X2.
[02:11:42.338 --> 02:11:52.846]  The specials that will end tomorrow, because we have new specials on Wednesday, will be the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste for adults and children, the Immune Gargle, the Mouthwash, all six products.
[02:11:54.008 --> 02:12:00.930]  Individually, or by themselves, or all at 50% off.
[02:12:00.930 --> 02:12:03.190]  Free shipping when you get them all together.
[02:12:03.190 --> 02:12:06.171]  You can also sign up for auto-ship on things you don't want to reorder.
[02:12:06.171 --> 02:12:07.711]  You get an additional 10% off.
[02:12:07.711 --> 02:12:08.832]  There's also Patriot Points.
[02:12:08.832 --> 02:12:11.992]  You get 5% on every purchase.
[02:12:11.992 --> 02:12:14.613]  Good towards other future purchases.
[02:12:14.613 --> 02:12:18.134]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:12:24.434 --> 02:12:27.975]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we have a bunch of other specials that are ending.
[02:12:27.975 --> 02:12:30.597]  The Real Red Pill, 50% off, is ending tomorrow.
[02:12:30.597 --> 02:12:36.039]  50% off on Alpha Power is ending tomorrow.
[02:12:36.039 --> 02:12:39.220]  40% off on Bodies.
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:41.601]  No, it's 50% off, excuse me.
[02:12:41.601 --> 02:12:43.542]  50% off on Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:12:43.542 --> 02:12:44.822]  That is ending tomorrow.
[02:12:44.822 --> 02:12:51.045]  It's all ending tomorrow because we have a new product we're launching on Wednesday.
[02:12:52.415 --> 02:12:54.836]  But listen, your purchases are vital.
[02:12:54.836 --> 02:12:58.197]  I've said we're expanding here.
[02:12:58.197 --> 02:13:07.899]  And I got all these calls from corporate establishment assassin media, really intelligence agency operatives and folks posing as media, saying, oh, did you get investors?
[02:13:07.899 --> 02:13:09.019]  Oh, did you get money?
[02:13:09.019 --> 02:13:10.980]  Oh, how are you doing that?
[02:13:12.225 --> 02:13:21.974]  I've told people we've been saving and building and preparing to hire more people and go 20 hours a day by the end of this year and to hire the talk show host and the engineers and the reporters and all the people.
[02:13:21.974 --> 02:13:23.516]  So this is our plan.
[02:13:23.516 --> 02:13:24.537]  This is our fuel.
[02:13:24.537 --> 02:13:26.258]  This is our launch operation.
[02:13:26.258 --> 02:13:27.219]  This is our target.
[02:13:27.219 --> 02:13:28.721]  That's how we're doing it to answer the media.
[02:13:29.381 --> 02:13:32.303]  And I haven't even gone to the private investors.
[02:13:32.303 --> 02:13:34.624]  I haven't gone to the private equity people.
[02:13:34.624 --> 02:13:36.905]  I haven't gone to the private placement people.
[02:13:36.905 --> 02:13:39.447]  I haven't gone to the going public situations.
[02:13:39.447 --> 02:13:43.889]  And I know that scared Soros when he learned that we were being offered a bunch of money by folks and all the rest of it.
[02:13:43.889 --> 02:13:47.932]  That's why they filed all their fake lawsuits, which are getting thrown out of court and are being defeated.
[02:13:48.973 --> 02:13:55.218]  The point is, is that we're not trying to get a, you know, jet airplane or a bigger house.
[02:13:55.218 --> 02:14:14.896]  I'm trying to hire people and launch a 24-hour radio slash TV network that's hardcore, that then makes it safe for the other talk show hosting people by getting our research to then go to the next level, which the Media Matters and CNN and all the rest of them have already figured that out.
[02:14:15.831 --> 02:14:28.641]  They've already figured out that we kind of break through the electronic Berlin Wall, we put out the research, we have the expert guest on, then that makes it safe for it to get picked up by Hannity, Limbaugh, and all the rest of them, which is great!
[02:14:28.641 --> 02:14:36.447]  Because they're not plagiarizing me, they're actually seeing the research, doing their own research, finding out it's true, so we're normalizing the liberty movement.
[02:14:36.447 --> 02:14:40.851]  We're normalizing not wanting to be ruled by secret offshore corporations that want us to be poor.
[02:14:41.311 --> 02:14:45.172]  We're normalizing that the Vatican's run by pedophiles, which is now confirmed.
[02:14:45.172 --> 02:14:47.473]  We're normalizing that CNN's fake news.
[02:14:47.473 --> 02:14:50.993]  We're normalizing it's okay to not be politically correct.
[02:14:50.993 --> 02:14:57.215]  And everything they do is to bully us into total submission to go along with that agenda.
[02:14:57.215 --> 02:15:05.677]  That's why they're telling you, oh, don't say 1776, it's a hate word, or oh, apologize when you change your baby's diaper, you're a pervert.
[02:15:05.677 --> 02:15:09.578]  No, you've got a weird twisted mind trying to make us like you, in my opinion.
[02:15:11.368 --> 02:15:12.530]  That's what this is all about.
[02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:15.676]  So it's all coming to a head, an incredibly historic moment.
[02:15:15.676 --> 02:15:16.637]  The tide is turning.
[02:15:16.637 --> 02:15:17.399]  Trump is winning.
[02:15:17.399 --> 02:15:18.961]  Nationalism is winning.
[02:15:18.961 --> 02:15:22.307]  Humanity is coming up from the water, trying to get air.
[02:15:22.307 --> 02:15:24.311]  We're fighting for our lives, but at least we're fighting.
[02:15:25.746 --> 02:15:30.989]  And that's why we need your prayers, your support, and to spread the articles, the videos, the links, you name it.
[02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:34.331]  It's because that's how we get past their electronic Berlin Wall.
[02:15:34.331 --> 02:15:36.512]  When you buy the products, we do it as well.
[02:15:36.512 --> 02:15:38.053]  We got Vox Day now!
[02:15:38.053 --> 02:15:39.494]  I'm fired up!
[02:15:39.494 --> 02:15:40.955]  Yeah!
[02:15:40.955 --> 02:15:43.837]  When we come back, we're gonna have them on the show!
[02:15:43.837 --> 02:15:46.258]  We're gonna wake up other people and we're gonna win!
[02:15:46.258 --> 02:15:48.039]  And we're gonna crush the apathy!
[02:15:48.039 --> 02:15:49.600]  We're gonna crush the globalists!
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:50.981]  We're gonna smash them!
[02:15:50.981 --> 02:15:52.161]  Victory's ours!
[02:15:52.161 --> 02:15:54.803]  Stay with us and spread the live links or roll over!
[02:15:55.486 --> 02:15:56.787]  Were you born before the year 1956?

[02:16:07.575 --> 02:16:08.756]  Or what about this?
[02:16:08.756 --> 02:16:10.698]  Did you know 54 U.S.

[02:17:25.976 --> 02:17:27.837]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[02:20:15.755 --> 02:20:19.036]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[02:20:19.036 --> 02:20:20.757]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:20.757 --> 02:20:25.839]  Ladies and gentlemen, we see a lot of hype in media.
[02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:46.474]  But you know I'll tell you when the straights are dire.
[02:20:46.474 --> 02:20:49.357]  I'll tell you when we're losing so we'll get up and fight back.
[02:20:49.357 --> 02:20:51.520]  We are winning globally.
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:56.526]  Nationalism, populism, Christianity's coming back from the dead.
[02:20:56.526 --> 02:20:58.869]  People understand globalism is death.
[02:20:58.869 --> 02:21:00.491]  Collectivism, communism is death.
[02:21:01.374 --> 02:21:03.236]  A lot of bad stuff's happening, too.
[02:21:03.236 --> 02:21:07.119]  GMO, the smartphones, you know, suicide going up.
[02:21:07.119 --> 02:21:10.082]  But that's people that haven't been warned who are susceptible.
[02:21:10.082 --> 02:21:17.309]  There's a larger and larger minority cadre of every race, color, and creed who is awake.
[02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:25.437]  And this situation with the Obama administration and the Hillary campaign caught
[02:21:26.573 --> 02:21:29.735]  Spying on Trump during the campaign and after.
[02:21:29.735 --> 02:21:35.880]  He was president-elect and they're arrogant saying, watch your mouth two days before the inauguration, Brennan.
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:45.808]  And the clips of Schumer going on TV and going, the intelligence communities have seven ways from Sunday to destroy you.
[02:21:46.741 --> 02:21:48.181]  And I read the New York Times.
[02:21:48.181 --> 02:21:50.002]  Don't worry, we know he's a Russian agent.
[02:21:50.002 --> 02:21:51.162]  We spied on him.
[02:21:51.162 --> 02:21:54.343]  And I'm like, look, they admit in all these articles they spied on him.
[02:21:54.343 --> 02:21:55.483]  Then they went, we never said that.
[02:21:55.483 --> 02:21:57.563]  Jones is crazy.
[02:21:57.563 --> 02:21:59.143]  And Trump got it from Jones.
[02:21:59.143 --> 02:22:02.404]  And this is all insane.
[02:22:02.404 --> 02:22:05.765]  I mean, I've got every major news channel saying that.
[02:22:05.765 --> 02:22:07.105]  By the way, Trump didn't get it from me.
[02:22:07.105 --> 02:22:09.025]  I got it from Trump.
[02:22:09.025 --> 02:22:11.306]  I got it from the same people in CENTCOM.
[02:22:12.602 --> 02:22:13.644]  They told me where to look.
[02:22:13.644 --> 02:22:15.347]  They didn't give me anything classified.
[02:22:15.347 --> 02:22:17.750]  They said these arrogant SOBs have been shooting their mouths off.
[02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:18.872]  Look here, here, and here.
[02:22:18.872 --> 02:22:20.735]  I got more stuff to do today.
[02:22:20.735 --> 02:22:23.600]  Because, and then it's all right there.
[02:22:24.679 --> 02:22:27.120]  And so, now it's all coming out.
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:28.340]  They are in full panic mode.
[02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:30.021]  A criminal investigation has begun.
[02:22:30.021 --> 02:22:34.523]  And Vox Dei, a best-selling author and researcher, he's over in Europe.
[02:22:34.523 --> 02:22:36.863]  And he... I already warned him about other subjects.
[02:22:36.863 --> 02:22:42.685]  He said, no, I'm going to talk about this because this is showing that America is worse in many cases than Banana Republic's.
[02:22:42.685 --> 02:22:44.466]  We just were naive about it.
[02:22:44.466 --> 02:22:46.567]  And this whole deep state is in a lot of trouble.
[02:22:47.367 --> 02:22:49.588]  Voxday.blogspot.com.
[02:22:49.588 --> 02:22:50.509]  We'll get into his books.
[02:22:50.509 --> 02:22:53.030]  He's got a new line of books coming out today.
[02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:54.751]  Alt Hero, number one, gets published.
[02:22:54.751 --> 02:22:56.372]  We'll talk about that towards the end of the hour.
[02:22:56.372 --> 02:22:59.173]  But I wanted to get him on right now.
[02:22:59.173 --> 02:23:00.394]  He was really on at the bottom of the hour.
[02:23:00.394 --> 02:23:01.714]  I misread my sheet here.
[02:23:01.714 --> 02:23:02.995]  I apologize to the producers.
[02:23:02.995 --> 02:23:04.476]  Like I said, I'm kind of wound up today.
[02:23:05.356 --> 02:23:06.197]  Good ways and bad.
[02:23:06.197 --> 02:23:09.440]  It's just insane, the energy level, what's happening.
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:16.286]  I get excited by stuff like this, Vox, but also at a gut level, I feel like the enemy's about to strike back, so I'm just totally agitated.
[02:23:16.286 --> 02:23:18.968]  Do you get what I'm saying?
[02:23:18.968 --> 02:23:19.969]  Absolutely.
[02:23:19.969 --> 02:23:33.020]  There's no question that every time the deep state takes a blow, they attempt to come up with some sort of way to intimidate and discourage people from looking too hard at what they're doing.
[02:23:33.928 --> 02:23:40.072]  But the reality is that the awareness of the deep state has never been greater.
[02:23:40.072 --> 02:23:43.674]  People didn't even understand what the deep state was.
[02:23:43.674 --> 02:23:48.536]  It was something that was usually talked about in a Turkish context.
[02:23:48.536 --> 02:24:03.025]  And it was only when people began to understand what was going on in Turkey with Erdogan and the deep state there, that they suddenly began to realize that the same process was at work in the United States as well.
[02:24:04.887 --> 02:24:05.407]  Exactly.
[02:24:05.407 --> 02:24:10.910]  They've spent decades since the 1947 National Security Act building the shadow government, Deep State.
[02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:14.372]  Then they spent decades having it go rogue and go completely illegitimate.
[02:24:14.372 --> 02:24:21.896]  And now in just a few years, it's crumbling, it's disintegrating, and its very foundations are imploding.
[02:24:21.896 --> 02:24:32.201]  Well, the thing that really struck me was the way in which these revelations about Stefan Halper's activities for the last 40 years
[02:24:33.658 --> 02:24:42.944]  have completely demolished the United States pretensions to moral superiority in the political context.
[02:24:42.944 --> 02:24:54.191]  You know, a lot of people don't understand that this has very serious ramifications around the world because countries like Korea and countries like Indonesia
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:57.481]  have been looking at the different models.
[02:24:57.481 --> 02:24:58.762]  They look at the Chinese model.
[02:24:58.762 --> 02:25:00.742]  They look at the United States model.
[02:25:00.742 --> 02:25:10.426]  And the main thing that the United States has had going for it, besides its economic wealth, has been its perception of moral superiority.
[02:25:10.426 --> 02:25:13.548]  You know, the United States is the true voice of the people.
[02:25:13.548 --> 02:25:16.589]  It's a true democracy and that sort of thing.
[02:25:16.589 --> 02:25:23.952]  But with these revelations that the deep state has been interfering with United States presidential elections,
[02:25:24.907 --> 02:25:30.054]  All the way back to Ronald Reagan versus Carter at the very least.
[02:25:30.054 --> 02:25:38.625]  You know, this completely changes the moral ramifications of the United States political system as it's viewed by the rest of the world.
[02:25:39.545 --> 02:25:41.887]  And did you get my little point though?
[02:25:41.887 --> 02:25:49.654]  This is a real civil war and Trump's made the decision to destroy the old deep state and really try to get rid of it and be more direct and pragmatic.
[02:25:49.654 --> 02:25:58.162]  And so when I explain that it's the Pentagon, it's the DEA, I mean these are real sources that gave us these documents at great risk to themselves.
[02:25:58.162 --> 02:26:04.128]  These are real people that told us what to look at, what was going on, what was happening and it turns out it's all true.
[02:26:04.888 --> 02:26:12.613]  What do you think CNN and all these people think now that they've said we're liars and all this and now it's coming out?
[02:26:12.613 --> 02:26:22.040]  Well, I think they're terrified because for years they've relied on their ability to cover things up.
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:30.405]  Both the people in the media as well as the people in the various bureaucracies and so forth.
[02:26:30.405 --> 02:26:31.606]  And so when you look at
[02:26:32.341 --> 02:26:49.945]  People like a Ben Shapiro, or you look at some of the people at CNN and even at Fox, and you see people who have been elevated, you have to wonder how many of them are getting payments like Stefan Halper was getting.
[02:26:49.945 --> 02:26:53.306]  They just revealed that the guy got paid something like $390,000 in 2016 and 2017.
[02:26:53.306 --> 02:26:54.086]  How many other people
[02:27:01.883 --> 02:27:05.484]  In the media are on similar payrolls.
[02:27:05.484 --> 02:27:28.673]  Now we have to start asking those questions, especially when you see some of these individuals coming out and defending the deep state and saying, oh, the FBI was just trying to protect Trump and coming up with these absurd cover stories and these absurd spins and these absurd explanations trying to hide the fact
[02:27:29.694 --> 02:27:32.677]  That we have this shadow system.
[02:27:32.677 --> 02:27:34.799]  It's more than just a shadow government.
[02:27:34.799 --> 02:27:39.263]  Because it extends into... It's a whole parallel track.
[02:27:39.263 --> 02:27:40.564]  It's a parallel track.
[02:27:40.564 --> 02:27:45.789]  And now they got to the point where they're trying to deconstruct the old track, the Republic, and put us only on the new track.
[02:27:45.789 --> 02:27:50.954]  But it's at that point that their new system implodes because we were here exposing it beforehand.
[02:27:50.954 --> 02:27:54.217]  And I think that's really where they were arrogant and didn't get what was happening.
[02:27:56.044 --> 02:28:02.268]  Well, I also think that they don't really understand how fragile their system is.
[02:28:02.268 --> 02:28:19.280]  One of the big problems of these various ideologies like communism, like feminism, these different ideas that are not based in reality, is that eventually they run into contact with reality and they tend to fall apart very rapidly.
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.862]  We saw that when we saw how quickly the Soviet Union fell apart.
[02:28:23.706 --> 02:28:31.002]  What a lot of people don't understand is that despite this all-encompassing system, despite the way that it extends tendrils into everything,
[02:28:33.494 --> 02:28:35.856]  It doesn't, it's not very necessarily very stable.
[02:28:35.856 --> 02:28:36.377]  No, you're right.
[02:28:36.377 --> 02:28:46.665]  It's a parasite that thinks it's the actual system, but it's only a parasite, and once that illusion's gone, the man behind the curtain, the whole thing caves in, and they don't know what to do.
[02:28:46.665 --> 02:28:54.912]  So they have megalomania, they're delusional, and that con game works for so long, but then suddenly when it stops working, it implodes very quickly.
[02:28:54.912 --> 02:28:55.493]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:57.455]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[02:28:58.495 --> 02:29:02.479]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[02:32:17.837 --> 02:32:28.844]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:32:28.844 --> 02:32:37.370]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.

[02:32:52.361 --> 02:32:53.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:21.224 --> 02:33:28.311]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.311 --> 02:33:30.814]  It was Barry Goldwater.
[02:33:30.814 --> 02:33:40.483]  You can trace back the first person since the 50s and 60s to really expose the conspiracy on a wide scale in Congress.
[02:33:40.483 --> 02:33:41.264]  Cleon Skousen.
[02:33:42.739 --> 02:33:48.985]  That was really who he was getting his information from, and he was a senior FBI agent who was allowed into the archives.
[02:33:48.985 --> 02:33:58.315]  But as soon as they figured out that big banks were funding the communists as an outside threat to the West so that we could become a police state as well, that was all shut down.
[02:33:58.315 --> 02:34:03.280]  But he said, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.181]  This is a war for me, folks.
[02:34:05.181 --> 02:34:06.463]  And I'm not up here tooting my horn.
[02:34:08.044 --> 02:34:10.946]  But, for whatever reason, they're mad at us.
[02:34:10.946 --> 02:34:14.949]  Well, it's because we're not afraid, and we're loud, and we're telling the truth.
[02:34:14.949 --> 02:34:19.612]  And now I learned from Roger Stone, and I talked to two of the people as well, here on air.
[02:34:19.612 --> 02:34:21.653]  We're going to get them back on.
[02:34:21.653 --> 02:34:31.640]  I've talked to two people that were grabbed up in the dragnet, and they've previously been on the show is what I meant to say, before they were caught up in the dragnet, Caputo and others.
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:33.981]  All about me, and I'm like, really?
[02:34:33.981 --> 02:34:35.623]  You're interrogated for eight hours?
[02:34:36.803 --> 02:34:41.664]  They ask you 20, 30 questions about me and about Russians and all this?
[02:34:41.664 --> 02:34:43.745]  That's all just an attempt at intimidation.
[02:34:43.745 --> 02:34:46.846]  Roll over to us or we're gonna come after you.
[02:34:46.846 --> 02:34:48.526]  As if I don't know they're a bunch of thugs.
[02:34:48.526 --> 02:34:53.388]  As if I don't know that the units out working for Mueller are bad people.
[02:34:53.388 --> 02:34:55.668]  Doesn't mean the whole FBI's bad.
[02:34:55.668 --> 02:35:00.570]  But this is all really coming to a head and we're talking to Vox Dei, author, researcher,
[02:35:02.156 --> 02:35:23.663]  All around smart guy to get his take on the point in history we are now, how big this is, and what you think they're going to do, what you think they're going to do to try to get out of this, because that's my real concern.
[02:35:23.663 --> 02:35:31.005]  Well, I think they are not going to do anything too direct simply because
[02:35:32.085 --> 02:35:35.427]  It's too much risk for them.
[02:35:35.427 --> 02:35:45.592]  When you've got a group of people who are very accustomed to winning, they're not going to be prone to take a lot of risks.
[02:35:45.592 --> 02:35:53.696]  And so I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to use the tools and the methods that they've been using for the last 30 years.
[02:35:54.989 --> 02:35:57.672]  You know, a little bit of an intimidation here.
[02:35:57.672 --> 02:36:01.516]  A lot of false stories there.
[02:36:01.516 --> 02:36:13.868]  There's some idea that there's a connection between all of these FBI connected school shootings.
[02:36:13.868 --> 02:36:16.992]  But you know, the main thing that we know
[02:36:18.462 --> 02:36:25.406]  Is that Trump is relying very heavily on military intelligence and on the US Marine Corps in particular.
[02:36:25.406 --> 02:36:36.433]  If you just look at the background of the people that he's got surrounding them, that he's got surrounding him, you can see that he's being very, very careful about who he permits around him.
[02:36:37.148 --> 02:36:39.109]  And I think that that's important.
[02:36:39.109 --> 02:36:55.660]  And as somebody who's from a long time Marine family myself, these are people who are genuine patriots, who take their oath to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic very seriously.
[02:36:55.660 --> 02:37:05.526]  And I don't think it's an accident that we're seeing so much Marine Corps related military intelligence surrounding the President right now.
[02:37:05.526 --> 02:37:06.387]  Well, adding to that,
[02:37:08.524 --> 02:37:13.608]  I was never somebody that just said, oh, our military is perfect, it's great, because I saw it being used as propaganda for the globalists.
[02:37:13.608 --> 02:37:15.530]  I was for the people in the military.
[02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:21.975]  But just being on the air 23 years now, the intel I've gotten from the military has always been accurate.
[02:37:21.975 --> 02:37:23.356]  They are the people fighting back.
[02:37:23.356 --> 02:37:27.399]  They're the people on the inside that are helping the American people get Trump in.
[02:37:27.399 --> 02:37:35.806]  And I look at the military in other countries, they're the ones pulling out of globalism as well, because they're trained to fight a foreign enemy, and globalism is this multinational foreign enemy.
[02:37:36.286 --> 02:37:42.787]  And so, yeah, they may have the intelligence chief heads, and they may have some of the top brass on the globalist side.
[02:37:42.787 --> 02:37:50.869]  But more and more, more and more, especially as Trump begins to win, people are going from being neutral to being pro-Trump.
[02:37:50.869 --> 02:37:53.269]  And I think that's why the globalists realize they're about to lose.
[02:37:53.269 --> 02:38:01.111]  And you saw Giuliani, or you probably did, we played a few times here, say on Fox over the weekend, he said,
[02:38:03.717 --> 02:38:04.958]  We can basically destroy you.
[02:38:04.958 --> 02:38:05.579]  We want peace.
[02:38:05.579 --> 02:38:07.741]  We want to stop this now and just move forward.
[02:38:07.741 --> 02:38:09.522]  We're trying to give you parlay.
[02:38:09.522 --> 02:38:11.043]  We're trying to give you quarter.
[02:38:11.043 --> 02:38:14.326]  But if you don't give us quarter, we're going to physically rip you to pieces.
[02:38:14.326 --> 02:38:17.789]  He says we're going to rip your report apart and we're going to rip you apart.
[02:38:17.789 --> 02:38:19.591]  And then he smiled.
[02:38:19.591 --> 02:38:21.493]  You can tell it's not a bluff because we know what they've done.
[02:38:21.493 --> 02:38:27.578]  The arrogance of these psychopaths throughout history that get into power who think they have unlimited power.
[02:38:27.578 --> 02:38:29.580]  I'll never forget Brennan.
[02:38:30.714 --> 02:38:42.164]  Two days before the inauguration, headline, Brennan, head of the CIA, tells President Trump, watch your mouth.
[02:38:42.164 --> 02:38:47.429]  And then when he got fired, three days after Trump got in, he was shocked!
[02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:49.171]  He thought he was God!
[02:38:49.171 --> 02:38:51.013]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[02:38:51.013 --> 02:38:52.294]  What is their psychology, Vox?
[02:38:54.292 --> 02:39:00.036]  Well, it's the problem that a lot of businessmen have after they've been successful for a long time.
[02:39:00.036 --> 02:39:08.821]  When you've been successful doing a certain thing a certain way, it's almost impossible to change your tactics.
[02:39:08.821 --> 02:39:11.843]  It's almost impossible to change your strategy.
[02:39:11.843 --> 02:39:17.427]  And so, a lot of what they have relied upon is deception.
[02:39:17.427 --> 02:39:22.550]  And they mistake the influence that they have from that deception
[02:39:23.328 --> 02:39:25.249]  For genuine power.
[02:39:25.249 --> 02:39:36.653]  And so, I want to get back to a point that you made about the way in which, around the world, the militaries are fighting back against globalism.
[02:39:36.653 --> 02:39:43.295]  We're seeing that, for example, even in countries like Italy, even in countries like Switzerland.
[02:39:43.295 --> 02:39:48.817]  It was kind of interesting because the Swiss government tends to be fairly globalist.
[02:39:48.817 --> 02:39:50.758]  A lot of the big banks are located there, of course.
[02:39:51.556 --> 02:40:06.524]  But it was fascinating when one of their top generals came out and said, we're instituting these military preparedness plans because we believe there's going to be massive ethnic conflict throughout Europe.
[02:40:06.524 --> 02:40:16.029]  And the generals and the militaries are preparing for the very stuff that the politicians are running around promising people is never going to happen.
[02:40:17.125 --> 02:40:26.902]  And so this clash between globalism and nationalism is not just the Trump administration against the deep state here.
[02:40:27.779 --> 02:40:38.409]  But it's the nationalist parties against the EU and against their collaborationist governments at the national levels.
[02:40:38.409 --> 02:40:44.074]  And that's why I get chills up my spine when you talk about that because I even forgot that headline last year and there were several others.
[02:40:44.074 --> 02:40:45.255]  It was even worse than you said.
[02:40:45.255 --> 02:40:46.637]  You're being conservative.
[02:40:46.637 --> 02:40:47.658]  The headlines were
[02:40:49.329 --> 02:41:07.083]  Swiss generals, it was a couple others as well, made similar statements, they said, are preparing for a civil war in Europe because the EU opening borders and that they believe that starting in Eastern Europe it'll flow and the countries are all going to go against it and then unify and that they believe Germany and France may cause a war.
[02:41:07.083 --> 02:41:08.604]  Now that was last year.
[02:41:08.604 --> 02:41:12.167]  Now the EU, run by Germany, is threatening
[02:41:13.451 --> 02:41:15.734]  EU military to inner countries.
[02:41:15.734 --> 02:41:25.206]  They told Italy, as you know, last year, if you keep stopping Zodiac boats that Soros brings in from North Africa every day, we may use ships to physically stop you.
[02:41:25.206 --> 02:41:28.430]  They're calling for a navy to block nation states' navies.
[02:41:28.911 --> 02:41:32.614]  Which tells us, folks, we're already in full civil war against the globalists.
[02:41:32.614 --> 02:41:34.455]  That's what I'm telling the listeners.
[02:41:34.455 --> 02:41:35.876]  And the generals get it.
[02:41:35.876 --> 02:41:44.843]  The globalists want to implode the pension funds, make everybody poor, create a giant underclass, and then have a breakaway civilization that steals all the technology.
[02:41:44.843 --> 02:41:47.065]  Well, these generals aren't perfect angels.
[02:41:47.065 --> 02:41:51.709]  They're just not anti-human, exterminist, crazy people.
[02:41:51.709 --> 02:41:56.893]  Well, the fascinating thing about the Italian people's response to that threat by the EU
[02:41:57.822 --> 02:42:04.708]  was to elect a Euro-skeptic government which just took power yesterday.
[02:42:04.708 --> 02:42:13.254]  Movimento 5 Stelle is of the left and the Liga which is led by the excellent Matteo Salvini is of the right.
[02:42:13.254 --> 02:42:18.339]  But both parties are very heavily anti-EU, very heavily anti-globalist.
[02:42:18.339 --> 02:42:22.382]  And so the left and the right here in Italy have come together
[02:42:23.397 --> 02:42:27.298]  And they're joining forces to kick out the EU.
[02:42:27.298 --> 02:42:34.660]  And there's a very good chance that you might see Italy leave the EU within a year or two.
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:38.661]  Because now they know the EU isn't about being able to drive through checkpoints quicker.
[02:42:38.661 --> 02:42:39.942]  It's not about being all friendly.
[02:42:39.942 --> 02:42:42.302]  It's about total enslavement to the globalists.
[02:42:42.302 --> 02:42:43.523]  It's all public.
[02:42:43.523 --> 02:42:50.165]  And the Communist Chinese coming in to control Davos two years ago and pointing their fingers at people, that woke Europe up.
[02:42:50.165 --> 02:42:50.825]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:50.825 --> 02:42:51.145]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:59.053]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.

[02:43:56.518 --> 02:44:06.665]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:06.665 --> 02:44:15.192]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.192 --> 02:44:23.979]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:26.055 --> 02:44:35.597]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:44:35.597 --> 02:44:45.639]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:45.639 --> 02:44:48.320]  It is amazing!
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:53.281]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:44:56.311 --> 02:45:03.956]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:45:03.956 --> 02:45:11.882]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:45:11.882 --> 02:45:14.984]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:45:15.604 --> 02:45:20.248]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:45:20.248 --> 02:45:24.371]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:45:24.371 --> 02:45:27.534]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:45:27.534 --> 02:45:32.297]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:45:32.297 --> 02:45:35.280]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:50.832]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.

[02:47:16.292 --> 02:47:20.425]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:47:20.425 --> 02:47:22.190]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:23.157 --> 02:47:24.938]  And they offer a boxed dance here with us.
[02:47:24.938 --> 02:47:27.879]  ...calling for an investigation without any evidence.
[02:47:27.879 --> 02:47:28.800]  Zero evidence.
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:30.760]  Trump has not produced a shred of evidence.
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.781]  There was no evidence for Trump's claims.
[02:47:32.781 --> 02:47:34.522]  The evidence did not come.
[02:47:34.522 --> 02:47:36.203]  So where did Trump get his info?
[02:47:36.203 --> 02:47:37.503]  From the CIA?
[02:47:37.503 --> 02:47:38.624]  From the FBI?
[02:47:38.624 --> 02:47:40.645]  Where are you getting this information?
[02:47:40.645 --> 02:47:42.686]  From a very reputable source.
[02:47:42.686 --> 02:47:43.006]  What?
[02:47:43.006 --> 02:47:43.826]  The FBI?
[02:47:43.826 --> 02:47:44.627]  The CIA?
[02:47:44.627 --> 02:47:45.707]  Info Wars.
[02:47:45.707 --> 02:47:48.548]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:47:48.548 --> 02:47:49.429]  You know he's legit.
[02:47:51.576 --> 02:48:01.303]  On every major news program in the country, last April, May, they came out and said, Alec Baldwin came out and said, Alex Jones says they're spying on me.
[02:48:01.303 --> 02:48:04.505]  They've been spying on my campaign.
[02:48:04.505 --> 02:48:05.906]  I didn't just make that up.
[02:48:05.906 --> 02:48:08.128]  They bragged about it.
[02:48:08.128 --> 02:48:11.410]  And then I confirmed from sources how they were doing it.
[02:48:11.410 --> 02:48:17.234]  I knew a year before it was in The Intercept that Trump had basically not even hired Eric Prince, just did it.
[02:48:18.336 --> 02:48:20.617]  I don't want to get into the details of it, because I don't know the details.
[02:48:20.617 --> 02:48:21.637]  I don't want to know the details.
[02:48:21.637 --> 02:48:24.698]  But he went and hired former head of Blackwater.
[02:48:24.698 --> 02:48:25.619]  Say what you want about that.
[02:48:25.619 --> 02:48:27.479]  He went and hired other groups.
[02:48:27.479 --> 02:48:32.021]  And let's just say I know a lot more.
[02:48:32.021 --> 02:48:34.902]  And let's just say that everything I was told was dead on accurate.
[02:48:34.902 --> 02:48:36.923]  I'm always like, why am I being told all this?
[02:48:36.923 --> 02:48:38.284]  They're like, because you're on the team, buddy.
[02:48:38.284 --> 02:48:39.364]  You're trusted.
[02:48:39.364 --> 02:48:41.765]  And I've never been let down by any of these people.
[02:48:42.856 --> 02:48:49.620]  I used to get stuff from patriots like 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and I just even wouldn't go with it because I thought, oh, it must all be corrupt.
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:50.321]  No!
[02:48:50.321 --> 02:48:51.462]  There's good people there.
[02:48:51.462 --> 02:48:53.323]  They don't want to live under this.
[02:48:53.323 --> 02:48:55.464]  And a lot of them are pragmatists.
[02:48:55.464 --> 02:49:00.928]  Globalism wants to make you poor and wants to destroy whatever culture you've got to control you.
[02:49:00.928 --> 02:49:03.849]  That's... Latin America could be super rich.
[02:49:03.849 --> 02:49:05.931]  They've had countries richer than the US before.
[02:49:05.931 --> 02:49:06.511]  Venezuela.
[02:49:09.477 --> 02:49:13.298]  The old saying, you know, as rich as an Argentine for Argentina.
[02:49:13.298 --> 02:49:17.460]  They have systems to make you poor as a political control arm.
[02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:18.940]  It's feudalism.
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:21.081]  And that's all come back.
[02:49:21.081 --> 02:49:25.343]  But since I mentioned it a bunch, here's CNN saying, I made up.
[02:49:25.343 --> 02:49:26.683]  And it's not about us tooting our horn.
[02:49:26.683 --> 02:49:28.904]  It's why they're attacking us.
[02:49:28.904 --> 02:49:31.785]  Because they know we're a big enough media outlet.
[02:49:31.785 --> 02:49:36.066]  We can punch through and get other people we have on as guests to punch through.
[02:49:36.066 --> 02:49:38.067]  And then it gets to the decision makers.
[02:49:39.807 --> 02:49:44.392]  Basically, we're covering what people in the government already know that are patriots.
[02:49:44.392 --> 02:49:45.373]  So why do they support the show?
[02:49:45.373 --> 02:49:48.737]  Because they already know more than we do, in many cases.
[02:49:48.737 --> 02:49:53.142]  But it decompartmentalizes them, and then it allows them to know they're not alone.
[02:49:53.142 --> 02:50:00.710]  So we give aid and comfort to the patriots, psychologically, that, hey, you got a radio show, you got a TV show, hey, we're fighting.
[02:50:01.687 --> 02:50:04.430]  And that's why they're out to get Infowars, to set the precedent.
[02:50:04.430 --> 02:50:06.912]  We'll talk to Vox Day about how he thinks they'll strike back.
[02:50:06.912 --> 02:50:09.974]  I keep going back to this because we're having victory right now.
[02:50:09.974 --> 02:50:12.817]  Trump's winning, nationalism's winning, but they're about to strike back.
[02:50:12.817 --> 02:50:14.939]  They're already striking back, so get ready.
[02:50:14.939 --> 02:50:20.123]  But right now, let's go ahead and play this clip again from Anderson Cooper on March, what was it, March 2nd?
[02:50:20.123 --> 02:50:21.945]  We wrote about it March 3rd.
[02:50:21.945 --> 02:50:24.247]  This is a year and three months ago.
[02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:26.489]  Literally playing dumb.
[02:50:28.109 --> 02:50:37.196]  Months after they admitted they were spying on Trump, they tried to spin it that, oh, Alex Jones made it up, as if I'm this discredited person.
[02:50:37.196 --> 02:50:39.037]  But now notice how that's boomeranged back.
[02:50:39.037 --> 02:50:39.358]  Here it is.
[02:50:40.325 --> 02:50:49.508]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on this kind of fringe right-wing media.
[02:50:49.508 --> 02:50:57.331]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[02:50:57.331 --> 02:51:02.713]  And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing InfoWars.
[02:51:02.713 --> 02:51:09.516]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[02:51:09.856 --> 02:51:22.885]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[02:51:22.885 --> 02:51:23.266]  Nothing.
[02:51:23.266 --> 02:51:27.388]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story that we would be rushing.
[02:51:27.388 --> 02:51:28.329]  I would not be sitting here with you.
[02:51:28.329 --> 02:51:30.130]  I'd be home writing it or out reporting it.
[02:51:30.130 --> 02:51:31.051]  All right, let's stop there.
[02:51:31.051 --> 02:51:31.752]  It just goes on.
[02:51:32.612 --> 02:51:33.773]  All of it confirmed.
[02:51:33.773 --> 02:51:35.114]  We broke the Halperin thing.
[02:51:35.114 --> 02:51:36.034]  All of it.
[02:51:36.034 --> 02:51:41.337]  But I was even told later by one of my sources, he said, you know, it's not just Cooper that's CIA.
[02:51:41.337 --> 02:51:43.499]  That's leftist arm of the CIA.
[02:51:43.499 --> 02:51:46.560]  And he said, you know, the guy they had on with him.
[02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:48.982]  Why don't you call CNN and ask him who's he work for?
[02:51:48.982 --> 02:51:52.904]  Because here's what is so scary and what Vox A was getting to.
[02:51:52.904 --> 02:51:57.107]  Their system's so fragile that once there's a chink in the armor, it's all over.
[02:51:57.107 --> 02:51:59.468]  Well, we just blew their whole breastplate off.
[02:51:59.468 --> 02:52:00.669]  Think that's an accurate statement, Vox?
[02:52:02.509 --> 02:52:03.970]  Without question.
[02:52:03.970 --> 02:52:12.877]  And it's interesting because what they're accusing you of, as is very often the case, exactly what they're doing.
[02:52:12.877 --> 02:52:22.704]  Whenever they focus criticism on someone they're trying to discredit, one of the things they often do is to accuse you of what they're already doing.
[02:52:23.536 --> 02:52:29.001]  You know, they find it impossible to imagine that anybody is operating any other way.
[02:52:29.001 --> 02:52:39.549]  And so, when they're making an accusation like that of you, you can be very, very certain that if you look hard enough, you'll find them doing precisely that.
[02:52:39.549 --> 02:52:44.773]  That's really smart, because I've been told by retired high-level spy chiefs and others that these aren't that smart of people, Alex.
[02:52:44.773 --> 02:52:46.455]  They're all about how they look and how they act.
[02:52:47.662 --> 02:52:49.122]  They're giving a playbook.
[02:52:49.122 --> 02:52:51.803]  If you don't know what to do, just invert, invert, invert.
[02:52:51.803 --> 02:52:53.064]  That's what you just said.
[02:52:53.064 --> 02:52:55.224]  That's what Satanists do.
[02:52:55.224 --> 02:52:56.605]  They just invert everything.
[02:52:56.605 --> 02:53:00.226]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:53:00.226 --> 02:53:01.126]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:53:01.126 --> 02:53:14.891]  And to get to your point or your question about how they're going to strike back, the two areas that they're going to focus on are deplatforming, because that's obviously the first thing that they always go to.
[02:53:16.023 --> 02:53:22.786]  The other thing that they're pushing hard at is they're trying to demonetize everything and everyone.
[02:53:22.786 --> 02:53:33.631]  So it's going to be harder and harder for right-wing companies and right-wing individuals to create bank accounts.
[02:53:34.326 --> 02:53:40.788]  Yeah, I think that the most useful thing that Trump could do once he manages to break the deep state
[02:54:05.263 --> 02:54:09.065]  Is to break the corporate wall.
[02:54:09.065 --> 02:54:15.128]  And what the corporate wall is, is the big social media.
[02:54:15.128 --> 02:54:21.211]  Plus the big online retailers and they've created a system.
[02:54:21.211 --> 02:54:25.914]  They basically created a shadow economy.
[02:54:25.914 --> 02:54:32.317]  That is the online economy, but they've rigged it in a way so that only people who are favored
[02:54:33.030 --> 02:54:36.013]  Are able to benefit to the full from it.
[02:55:01.243 --> 02:55:17.046]  Well, I think that if you look at the combination of Facebook and Google, which now presently account for something like 85% of all online advertising, simply breaking up that duopoly would
[02:55:18.209 --> 02:55:25.034]  Offer a lot of opportunity to a lot of new players with Amazon.
[02:55:25.034 --> 02:55:33.100]  They're in a difficult position because on a global scale, they're not equipped to compete with the big Chinese Alibaba.
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:33.700]  I think it's called.
[02:55:36.067 --> 02:55:51.194]  No, I agree with you, but when it comes to funding, Trump knows that shadow funding, even worse than Soros, Bezos, is so crazy that he is actually almost rivaling in funding against Trump and America, Soros.
[02:55:51.194 --> 02:55:52.434]  I mean, what a stupid position.
[02:55:52.434 --> 02:55:53.095]  Exactly.
[02:55:53.095 --> 02:55:58.997]  If Amazon worked with everybody, we could use it against the Chinese, but he's just crazy.
[02:55:58.997 --> 02:56:03.099]  Well, that's the difficult position that
[02:56:04.624 --> 02:56:13.870]  Bezos has put Amazon in because on the one hand you've got something that is, should be for everyone.
[02:56:13.870 --> 02:56:29.599]  It's a wonderful platform and they've managed it in a way, essentially it's never made any money and the investors don't care about it making any money because it just keeps becoming more valuable by gaining more and more market share.
[02:56:29.599 --> 02:56:31.540]  But as with all giants,
[02:56:32.501 --> 02:56:39.842]  The more that they start to abuse their position, the more that they create the opportunity for them to be disrupted.
[02:56:39.842 --> 02:56:53.585]  And so I expect, and I've already seen some signs, that there's going to be a number of seriously well-funded, seriously well-conceived attempts to disrupt Amazon.
[02:56:53.585 --> 02:56:57.225]  So they're going to be coming up against Alibaba and the Chinese on one side.
[02:56:57.225 --> 02:57:00.166]  They're going to be coming up against these competitors on the other.
[02:57:00.786 --> 02:57:06.114]  And then you've got the potential risk of the antitrust from the Trump administration as well.
[02:57:06.114 --> 02:57:13.465]  I've noticed the only truth Amazon tells the Washington Post is exposing the Communist Chinese because he gets Alibaba, his government, back.
[02:57:13.465 --> 02:57:15.007]  And like, why is he against Trump?
[02:57:15.007 --> 02:57:15.808]  He's a moron!
[02:57:17.579 --> 02:57:18.960]  It's just get out of the way, man.
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:20.320]  You can have to be the richest guy in the world.
[02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:24.061]  Just don't try to screw over America and take our guns, jerk.
[02:57:24.061 --> 02:57:31.883]  But again, they trained them all very young, these leftists, like baby ducks, who imprint on hating America and hating Christians.
[02:57:31.883 --> 02:57:35.124]  We're going to come back, because I want you to be able to plug your new comic books coming out, your other books.
[02:57:35.124 --> 02:57:39.626]  We're back in just two minutes, final segment with Vox Dei, who I tell you is awesome.
[02:57:39.626 --> 02:57:40.826]  Hope will come on a lot more.
[02:57:40.826 --> 02:57:43.127]  And then we've got Matt Bracken coming up, fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:57:45.071 --> 02:57:48.655]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.655 --> 02:57:50.437]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.437 --> 02:58:01.708]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.489 --> 02:58:11.532]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.532 --> 02:58:17.614]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.614 --> 02:58:22.195]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.715 --> 02:58:25.338]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.338 --> 02:58:27.060]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:37.070]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.070 --> 02:58:39.713]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.713 --> 02:58:44.418]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:58:45.936 --> 02:58:46.156]  I don't
[02:59:05.111 --> 02:59:05.911]  The revolution.
[02:59:05.911 --> 02:59:08.012]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:59:08.012 --> 02:59:12.013]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:12.013 --> 02:59:19.255]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:59:19.255 --> 02:59:21.656]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:21.656 --> 02:59:24.297]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:59:24.297 --> 02:59:24.937]  That's my dad.
[02:59:24.937 --> 02:59:27.078]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:59:27.078 --> 02:59:29.358]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[02:59:31.579 --> 02:59:33.782]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:15.942 --> 03:00:19.288]  Alright, final segment of the Vox Day.
[03:00:19.288 --> 03:00:21.071]  We are living in epic times right now.
[03:00:21.071 --> 03:00:21.632]  Speaking of...
[03:00:23.061 --> 03:00:25.643]  Not being funded by the big globalists.
[03:00:25.643 --> 03:00:30.306]  When Vox sells his books, that's how he funds his operation and what he does with his show.
[03:00:30.306 --> 03:00:33.168]  When we sell products at Infowarsstore.com, that's how we're doing all of this.
[03:00:33.168 --> 03:00:34.609]  So thank you all.
[03:00:34.609 --> 03:00:36.130]  When you thank me, it's really obscene.
[03:00:36.130 --> 03:00:37.550]  Thank you for funding us.
[03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:45.095]  Got a bunch of products, like DNA Force, Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, all the fluoride-free toothpaste, all of it 50% off.
[03:00:45.095 --> 03:00:47.077]  That all has to end tomorrow.
[03:00:47.677 --> 03:00:50.038]  The sale will go through Wednesday morning, that's it.
[03:00:50.038 --> 03:00:51.059]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:00:51.059 --> 03:00:59.603]  But Vox, speaking of yourself and the work you're doing, tell us, you know, you've written SJW is Always Lying, SJW is Always Double Down.
[03:00:59.603 --> 03:01:03.846]  Those books are available at a lot of different places, like voxday.blogspot.com.
[03:01:03.846 --> 03:01:11.310]  But also, you are now just releasing today, because you're also a big comic book publisher, Alt Hero No.
[03:01:11.310 --> 03:01:11.370]  1.
[03:01:11.370 --> 03:01:11.970]  Tell us about that.
[03:01:14.059 --> 03:01:22.645]  Well, for about the last three years, people have been encouraging me to get into comics because they said the SJWs have completely destroyed the comics industry.
[03:01:22.645 --> 03:01:26.607]  They've completely taken over Marvel, they've completely taken over DC.
[03:01:26.607 --> 03:01:39.296]  And so, we did a Kickstarter on Freestarter, and we actually ended up raising more money than anyone had ever raised for a new comic before.
[03:01:39.296 --> 03:01:41.157]  And everybody was astonished.
[03:01:41.855 --> 03:01:51.779]  And so I was very, very happy today to be able to announce the release of the first digital edition of Alt Hero.
[03:01:51.779 --> 03:02:04.285]  And it's a big step in the culture wars because it's the first time that the right is actually taking back ground that the left had previously claimed.
[03:02:05.006 --> 03:02:08.287]  And so, you know, the response has been fantastic.
[03:02:08.287 --> 03:02:11.868]  It's already the number one new release in comics on Amazon.
[03:02:11.868 --> 03:02:12.709]  Wow.
[03:02:12.709 --> 03:02:14.049]  We should have led with that.
[03:02:14.049 --> 03:02:20.271]  The number one, you know, new independent comic guy in the world, Vox Dei, is on with us.
[03:02:20.271 --> 03:02:21.052]  But you know what?
[03:02:21.052 --> 03:02:27.394]  I used to have a crush on Baroness, even though she was a bad girl, but I do like the... I like the Marilyn Monroe-shaped redhead.
[03:02:27.394 --> 03:02:27.734]  Who's she?
[03:02:28.829 --> 03:02:35.892]  Oh, that's Dina Meek, and she's the newest recruit to the Global Justice Initiative.
[03:02:35.892 --> 03:02:41.214]  And if you like Dina Meek, you're really going to like Rebel, who gets introduced in Alt-Hero Number 2.
[03:02:41.214 --> 03:02:45.976]  Well, I gotta tell you, it's awesome, because notice she doesn't look like a heroin head.
[03:02:45.976 --> 03:02:47.297]  She hasn't been drinking soy.
[03:02:47.297 --> 03:02:47.977]  She looks like a woman.
[03:02:50.310 --> 03:02:59.239]  Yeah, it's actually a lot of fun to go in and violate pretty much all of the SJW imperatives.
[03:02:59.239 --> 03:03:01.621]  They're chopping the hair off women.
[03:03:01.621 --> 03:03:03.984]  They're making all the women fat.
[03:03:06.454 --> 03:03:18.837]  It's really ridiculous, and so, you know, the artists have been really excited about being able to draw proper comics again, and, you know, for me it's fun to be able to... Yeah, think about that!
[03:03:18.837 --> 03:03:22.458]  You don't see the archetypal goddess imagery anymore.
[03:03:22.458 --> 03:03:25.659]  Like, when you see a god, like, you know, you see it.
[03:03:25.659 --> 03:03:31.040]  Because they either want fat and look like a man, or like an emaciated little boy, not the goddess, you know, look.
[03:03:32.651 --> 03:03:35.513]  Oh, exactly, and that's intentional.
[03:03:35.513 --> 03:03:44.998]  If you look at what they're doing, they keep introducing more and more gay characters, more and more transgender characters, and this is very, very intentional.
[03:03:44.998 --> 03:03:55.283]  And so, what we are doing is we're coming back and we're hitting them hard, and we are, we're coming, the storylines revolve around globalism versus nationalism.
[03:03:56.207 --> 03:03:59.309]  But it's not, it's not preachy.
[03:03:59.309 --> 03:04:05.293]  You know, I'm a novelist, so I understand the importance of, you know, the story has to come first.
[03:04:05.293 --> 03:04:05.634]  Subtly.
[03:04:05.634 --> 03:04:07.675]  You can't preach to people.
[03:04:07.675 --> 03:04:10.617]  Subtly.
[03:04:10.617 --> 03:04:11.618]  Well, exactly.
[03:04:11.618 --> 03:04:20.184]  And the thing is, is that because of what's going on in real life, like for example, here it talks about how across the city of Berlin arrests are taking place.
[03:04:20.184 --> 03:04:23.446]  Well, the ironic thing is, I wrote that before
[03:04:24.261 --> 03:04:31.433]  The German police actually executed very similar raids, they just didn't use superheroes to do it.
[03:04:32.768 --> 03:04:33.449]  I know you gotta go.
[03:04:33.449 --> 03:04:35.290]  Let's do five more minutes and Matt Bragg is taking over.
[03:04:35.290 --> 03:04:36.371]  But this is so revolutionary.
[03:04:36.371 --> 03:04:39.273]  We should have opened up with the fact that you're launching this comic.
[03:04:39.273 --> 03:04:40.454]  Because this is revolutionary.
[03:04:40.454 --> 03:04:47.940]  We don't just let the left and Soros the Globalist take over every, like Marvel and DC have comics against me that are on store shelves.
[03:04:47.940 --> 03:04:51.723]  I've been in a store and seen a comic book attacking me.
[03:04:51.723 --> 03:04:54.686]  We've gotta get on this turf and Vox Dei is doing it.
[03:04:54.686 --> 03:05:00.730]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:01.607 --> 03:05:14.699]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[03:05:14.699 --> 03:05:25.209]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[03:05:25.769 --> 03:05:33.155]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[03:05:33.155 --> 03:05:47.806]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[03:05:47.806 --> 03:05:50.488]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:06:11.477 --> 03:06:16.984]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:16.984 --> 03:06:21.691]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.139 --> 03:06:32.743]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown has a nickname for Trump.
[03:06:32.743 --> 03:06:34.685]  It's the Wrecking Ball.
[03:06:34.685 --> 03:06:39.290]  And you know, I've been called the Bulldog and all that, but I gotta tell you, I'm jealous of that nickname for Trump.
[03:06:39.290 --> 03:06:41.452]  I wanna be known as the Wrecking Ball.
[03:06:41.452 --> 03:06:42.714]  Because I'm not so.
[03:06:44.113 --> 03:06:48.436]  I'm like a big old 2,000, 3,000 pound wrecking ball slamming into the face of the globalists.
[03:06:48.436 --> 03:06:56.121]  But then there's all the intellectual gravitas and intelligence of the artist and the subtlety and all of it.
[03:06:56.121 --> 03:07:12.232]  But once you realize how the globalists are hitting you with subtle propaganda, but then also over the top, on top of it, then you see something like a Vox Dei comic coming out, already the number one new comic on Amazon, and it just shows how people
[03:07:13.072 --> 03:07:13.593]  I don't know.
[03:07:29.434 --> 03:07:31.254]  The woman is on the pedestal right there.
[03:07:31.254 --> 03:07:32.535]  She's the power.
[03:07:32.535 --> 03:07:39.536]  And see, that's the opposite of what the left claims they're doing for you, but they're taking that magic power because they want to imprison that.
[03:07:39.536 --> 03:07:41.817]  And they do it on every front.
[03:07:41.817 --> 03:07:47.078]  They teach males to be all sneaky and manipulative and cowardly and, you know, they say there's a myth of masculinity.
[03:07:47.078 --> 03:07:48.378]  There's a myth of femininity.
[03:07:48.378 --> 03:07:50.098]  No, it's not!
[03:07:50.098 --> 03:07:51.959]  And the way they want to try to define everything.
[03:07:51.959 --> 03:07:52.859]  I've got articles right here.
[03:07:53.908 --> 03:07:56.831]  Where they were going to have a big event.
[03:07:56.831 --> 03:08:01.255]  A high school principal apologizes for party like it's 1776 on prom tickets.
[03:08:01.255 --> 03:08:03.557]  Jamie White, Infowars.com.
[03:08:03.557 --> 03:08:05.499]  New Jersey High School, they were having an event.
[03:08:06.786 --> 03:08:09.048]  But the Constitution Center!
[03:08:09.048 --> 03:08:12.150]  America was about the idea of empowering everybody.
[03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:14.011]  Didn't mean it started right away.
[03:08:14.011 --> 03:08:15.612]  The West is what was the forefront.
[03:08:15.612 --> 03:08:17.854]  But then they're saying, you're not part of the West.
[03:08:17.854 --> 03:08:19.235]  You're not part of the future.
[03:08:19.235 --> 03:08:21.456]  People are offended by 1776.
[03:08:21.456 --> 03:08:23.197]  Well then blow the Liberty Bell up!
[03:08:23.197 --> 03:08:25.919]  Burn down Constitution Hall!
[03:08:25.919 --> 03:08:27.840]  Get rid of July 4th then!
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:31.043]  How they're stealing your birthright.
[03:08:31.043 --> 03:08:34.025]  Most white people's ancestors came here after the Civil War.
[03:08:35.233 --> 03:08:38.856]  Your birthright's 1776 if you're black, if you're Hispanic.
[03:08:38.856 --> 03:08:42.619]  But they steal it from you like they're representing you.
[03:08:42.619 --> 03:08:45.802]  And if you look, everywhere they're stealing the power.
[03:08:45.802 --> 03:08:47.763]  Everywhere they're stealing the archetypes.
[03:08:47.763 --> 03:08:49.645]  Everywhere they're stealing what makes us great.
[03:08:50.649 --> 03:08:58.931]  And they have academics and people on the BBC saying, when you change your diaper, you have to ask permission or you're a pervert.
[03:08:58.931 --> 03:09:02.992]  No, a pervert says something like that to introduce that into our mind.
[03:09:02.992 --> 03:09:05.813]  Like Dana Lash getting it and saying, look at the studies.
[03:09:05.813 --> 03:09:08.234]  You promote school shootings, you promote the shooters.
[03:09:08.234 --> 03:09:09.174]  It didn't happen before 1999.
[03:09:10.174 --> 03:09:11.856]  We already had the guns then.
[03:09:11.856 --> 03:09:15.621]  It's the evil, the psychological poisoning coming in.
[03:09:15.621 --> 03:09:19.646]  But once you're aware of the poisoning, then it loses all power.
[03:09:19.646 --> 03:09:23.731]  Even if you're talking to someone who's been under the spell of the poisoning.
[03:09:23.731 --> 03:09:29.438]  Once you show them the spell and how they were psychologically hit, they can break out of it sometimes in minutes.
[03:09:30.578 --> 03:09:32.721]  But again, they need the human touch.
[03:09:32.721 --> 03:09:36.126]  They need us that are awake to go out and break them out of the spell.
[03:09:36.126 --> 03:09:38.529]  Fox Day, I'm very excited about what you're doing.
[03:09:38.529 --> 03:09:41.172]  Glad to hear your new comic book is already number one on Amazon.
[03:09:41.172 --> 03:09:42.374]  Tell folks how they can get it.
[03:09:42.374 --> 03:09:43.956]  I'm going to buy a ton of them.
[03:09:43.956 --> 03:09:45.078]  If I get a great deal, I'll put them...
[03:09:45.438 --> 03:09:49.501]  Well first of all, I want to point out that if you've got a Kindle Unlimited
[03:10:09.255 --> 03:10:11.097]  That the comic is free to you.
[03:10:11.097 --> 03:10:14.179]  So, the digital comic.
[03:10:14.179 --> 03:10:18.302]  We have print versions coming out very soon.
[03:10:18.302 --> 03:10:21.145]  These are two of the early ones that we did.
[03:10:21.145 --> 03:10:34.075]  We're going to have Alt Hero out in print within two weeks, and it's going to be in German, Italian, and French, and possibly Swedish as well.
[03:10:34.075 --> 03:10:37.979]  And so, you know, we are committed to
[03:10:39.592 --> 03:10:47.558]  Bringing out these quality stories in a way that is vastly superior to what DC and Marvel are doing.
[03:10:47.558 --> 03:10:58.446]  You know, it is our long-term goal to become the number three company in comics and, you know, eventually start producing movies and all that sort of thing.
[03:10:58.446 --> 03:11:07.032]  And we think it's doable because there is such a hunger in the market, you know, the comic market has shrunk.
[03:11:07.580 --> 03:11:17.329]  By about 25% in the last three years just because the SJWs are telling these stories and pushing these messages that nobody wants to read.
[03:11:17.329 --> 03:11:21.433]  And so this is a genuine alternative.
[03:11:21.433 --> 03:11:30.241]  The storyline is fundamentally based on nationalism and globalism because that's the most relevant story in the world today.
[03:11:31.227 --> 03:11:36.429]  And, you know, like I said, if you've got Kindle Unlimited, you can check it out for free.
[03:11:36.429 --> 03:11:41.830]  It's only $2.99, and I think if you look at the reviews, people are really enjoying it.
[03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:43.771]  Let's be clear.
[03:11:43.771 --> 03:11:51.893]  Driving something like this to the top, just like you've done with your Kickstarter and all the other stuff you've done, sets the precedent.
[03:11:53.309 --> 03:11:59.754]  Nothing succeeds like success, and the work's great, it's amazing, and it's already number one on Amazon.
[03:11:59.754 --> 03:12:01.756]  So, and again, I'm not criticizing anybody that's on Amazon.
[03:12:01.756 --> 03:12:03.477]  We're on Amazon.
[03:12:03.477 --> 03:12:08.501]  We sell our products there as well, but we have to do that where people can sell counterfeits.
[03:12:08.501 --> 03:12:12.424]  So we have to be on there to control the market, but we don't promote the fact we're on Amazon.
[03:12:12.424 --> 03:12:13.325]  But when it comes to print,
[03:12:14.477 --> 03:12:15.578]  It dominates it.
[03:12:15.578 --> 03:12:22.362]  So the fact that you've got it discounted for folks and free for people that already have the Kindle, that is very, very exciting.
[03:12:22.362 --> 03:12:26.224]  So good job having the number one new hot release with Alt-Hero.
[03:12:26.224 --> 03:12:32.348]  That's got to make you really, really happy, Vox Dave.
[03:12:32.348 --> 03:12:34.569]  I'm more relieved.
[03:12:34.569 --> 03:12:38.071]  This was the first time that we ever did a comic, and so
[03:12:40.434 --> 03:12:45.137]  It was definitely a new experience, but we have a great team.
[03:12:45.137 --> 03:12:52.020]  We've got the best writer in comics who's doing a separate series for us called Avalon.
[03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:53.801]  His name's Chuck Dixon.
[03:12:53.801 --> 03:12:54.441]  He's the man.
[03:12:54.441 --> 03:12:59.704]  It's only going to get better from here.
[03:12:59.704 --> 03:13:07.008]  We're just learning what we're doing, and I think within a year or so, a lot more people are going to be familiar with it.
[03:13:07.168 --> 03:13:07.908]  And you're right.
[03:13:07.908 --> 03:13:11.669]  The market is there for nationalism, for liberty, for freedom.
[03:13:11.669 --> 03:13:16.911]  But all these corporate guys want to play it safe, lest the newspaper attack you.
[03:13:16.911 --> 03:13:20.852]  You want to be attacked by the fake news.
[03:13:20.852 --> 03:13:26.714]  I don't get how they have turned so many men into these jellyfish cowards.
[03:13:26.714 --> 03:13:32.256]  And even if they were cold-blooded, the liberty movement is the place to grow and expand.
[03:13:32.256 --> 03:13:33.857]  They don't get that.
[03:13:33.857 --> 03:13:34.677]  They're so stupid.
[03:13:36.087 --> 03:13:37.468]  Well, you have to expect it.
[03:13:37.468 --> 03:13:47.251]  We just released Alt Hero today, but already Rolling Stone and NPR are doing a hit piece on us.
[03:13:47.251 --> 03:13:51.513]  They interviewed Chuck Dixon about a week ago.
[03:13:51.513 --> 03:13:55.354]  They wanted to interview me a second time, and I just said, hey, look, you've got enough information.
[03:13:58.146 --> 03:14:05.052]  The whole discredit, disqualification campaign is going to begin, but we're not afraid of that.
[03:14:05.052 --> 03:14:05.552]  Exactly!
[03:14:05.552 --> 03:14:10.657]  The headline's going to be, take white supremacist media off the web, even though that's not what it is.
[03:14:10.657 --> 03:14:11.798]  I mean, that'll be it.
[03:14:11.798 --> 03:14:13.459]  We can't compete against this!
[03:14:13.459 --> 03:14:14.600]  We own the universe!
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:17.723]  Don't let him have that!
[03:14:17.723 --> 03:14:24.709]  Oh, I have no doubt that it's going to get a lot of negative media attention once the media embargo cracks.
[03:14:28.393 --> 03:14:31.616]  Where do you go from here?
[03:14:31.616 --> 03:14:33.637]  Well, we've got to scale up.
[03:14:33.637 --> 03:14:40.643]  I mean, the big thing is we now have the process in place.
[03:14:40.643 --> 03:14:42.004]  We've got the books coming out.
[03:14:42.004 --> 03:14:44.766]  We've got the comics coming out.
[03:14:44.766 --> 03:14:52.953]  Now the thing is to go from selling 2,000 of a book to trying to sell 10,000 of a book.
[03:14:52.953 --> 03:14:55.855]  Once you hit that level, then you can do all sorts of things.
[03:14:55.855 --> 03:14:57.837]  It's easier to eat big fish than eat little fish.
[03:14:59.358 --> 03:15:00.239]  Right.
[03:15:00.239 --> 03:15:13.692]  But we will not be selling out to Marvel or, you know, our publishing company Castalia House has had, I think, four offers so far.
[03:15:13.692 --> 03:15:17.736]  And, you know, we're just not interested in doing that because we like what we're doing.
[03:15:17.736 --> 03:15:20.539]  We enjoy what we're doing and we believe in what we're doing.
[03:15:20.539 --> 03:15:22.541]  And as you can see, we're not afraid to
[03:15:23.901 --> 03:15:29.623]  Fly the Confederate flag despite the fact that the left has come out so hard against it.
[03:15:29.623 --> 03:15:36.165]  And basically, we look for anything the left tells us is off-limits.
[03:15:36.165 --> 03:15:38.746]  We're going to be going for that, and we're going to go for it hard.
[03:15:38.746 --> 03:15:39.766]  Vox, I'm excited.
[03:15:39.766 --> 03:15:40.427]  God bless you.
[03:15:40.427 --> 03:15:42.227]  Thanks for giving us the big interview on this launch today.
[03:15:42.227 --> 03:15:43.348]  Congratulations.
[03:15:43.348 --> 03:15:44.788]  The victory continues.
[03:15:44.788 --> 03:15:46.209]  Victory for planet Earth, period.
[03:15:46.209 --> 03:15:47.469]  Victory for free speech.
[03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:49.110]  Straight ahead, he's taking over.
[03:15:49.110 --> 03:15:50.110]  Matt Bracken, stay with us.
[03:15:53.365 --> 03:15:55.226]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:17:34.556 --> 03:17:40.241]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:17:40.241 --> 03:17:43.684]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.

[03:19:57.684 --> 03:20:00.365]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.447 --> 03:20:15.249]  All right, Matt Bracken's taking over.
[03:20:15.249 --> 03:20:19.252]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com, former Navy SEAL anti-terrorism expert.
[03:20:19.252 --> 03:20:31.843]  I'm sure he'll get into the shooting in Texas and the huge news of the ongoing moves for the criminal investigation that's now afoot against the illegal spy network that we first exposed a year and a half ago.
[03:20:31.843 --> 03:20:33.124]  Matt Bracken, thanks for joining us.
[03:20:33.124 --> 03:20:34.986]  Take over.
[03:20:34.986 --> 03:20:36.027]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:20:36.027 --> 03:20:36.787]  What a day.
[03:20:36.787 --> 03:20:38.889]  Three o'clock is the hour that supposedly
[03:20:40.126 --> 03:20:47.310]  Christopher Wray and Rod Rosenstein have been commanded to come to the White House to get a spanking, I think.
[03:20:47.310 --> 03:20:51.553]  So I think we're going to be seeing some major evening news tonight.
[03:20:51.553 --> 03:20:56.036]  I don't know if Rod Rosenstein's going to be fired, if that's going to be the news.
[03:20:56.036 --> 03:21:02.520]  I'd like to see President Trump going over to the Department of Justice and the FBI with the U.S.
[03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:09.584]  Marshals and go in with orders to remove what the House Intelligence Committee wants.
[03:21:10.405 --> 03:21:13.926]  Otherwise, anybody standing in the way is going to be let out in handcuffs.
[03:21:13.926 --> 03:21:14.226]  That's right.
[03:21:14.226 --> 03:21:14.826]  Let's be clear.
[03:21:14.826 --> 03:21:15.886]  I should have led the show with this.
[03:21:15.886 --> 03:21:17.946]  Thank God you're here.
[03:21:17.946 --> 03:21:20.267]  The President can declassify anything he wants.
[03:21:20.267 --> 03:21:22.727]  And for months, they won't give Nunes any of this stuff.
[03:21:22.727 --> 03:21:24.408]  So, I mean, I agree.
[03:21:24.408 --> 03:21:28.268]  The fact that they're being summoned as we speak, this is historic.
[03:21:28.268 --> 03:21:30.709]  They're about to give an ultimatum like Giuliani.
[03:21:30.709 --> 03:21:36.430]  He's going to say, listen, I'm going to let you skate like Napoleon to Alba, but you guys got to run the white flag up or I'm going to drop the hammer on you.
[03:21:37.332 --> 03:21:46.574]  Yeah, I think he is going to drop the hammer and I think that this is what Sundance at Conservative Treehouse, he's been a contrarian on this.
[03:21:46.574 --> 03:21:59.396]  He's been saying that Sessions and Trump have been hanging back, letting the coup plotters basically hang themselves and dig themselves in deeper.
[03:21:59.396 --> 03:22:01.717]  And that's why Sessions wouldn't touch anything and recuse himself?
[03:22:03.166 --> 03:22:14.450]  I think that Sessions won't even make a statement, because anything that he said would be perceived as politicizing the outcome.
[03:22:14.450 --> 03:22:23.453]  So when the IG report comes, it might turn out that Huber from Utah is a white hat, even though he was a Democrat appointee.
[03:22:23.453 --> 03:22:26.794]  He might be a white hat, and over at conservative Treehouse,
[03:22:27.455 --> 03:22:35.778]  That's been the operating thesis, is that when the IG drops, the indictments are going to drop, that they've been working together.
[03:22:35.778 --> 03:22:38.339]  And it's going to be a real tidal wave.
[03:22:38.339 --> 03:22:54.945]  And unlike in 1974 with Watergate, when the Republicans basically told Nixon to hang it up, the Democrats are basically deciding to stay in this kamikaze plane on fire right into the ground.
[03:22:55.566 --> 03:22:59.047]  Which is great, because I think they could be wiped out in the mid-term.
[03:22:59.047 --> 03:23:00.907]  I was about to say, I think the tide has turned.
[03:23:00.907 --> 03:23:02.607]  All the numbers, all the facts show it.
[03:23:02.607 --> 03:23:04.748]  They've been caught lying, saying there was no spying.
[03:23:04.748 --> 03:23:06.188]  Now the FBI admits it happened.
[03:23:06.188 --> 03:23:07.428]  They can't recover from this.
[03:23:07.428 --> 03:23:11.049]  This is, this is... But let's not be too confident.
[03:23:11.049 --> 03:23:13.449]  I think we're in prime false flag zone now.
[03:23:13.449 --> 03:23:15.590]  I think that... Definitely.
[03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:17.610]  Yeah, where's Joseph Mifsud?
[03:23:17.610 --> 03:23:23.811]  I think he's probably at the bottom of the Wicomico River, around where Colby had a canoe accident.
[03:23:24.465 --> 03:23:27.370]  You know, he hasn't been seen in months.
[03:23:27.370 --> 03:23:31.095]  And we know John Brennan, he's a Stalinist.
[03:23:31.095 --> 03:23:32.277]  He voted Communist in 76.
[03:23:33.797 --> 03:23:37.078]  And joined the CIA in 1980, which is amazing.
[03:23:37.078 --> 03:23:45.142]  And then rose through the ranks, and a Marxist named Barack Obama appointed him to be the head of the, you know, the entire Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:23:45.142 --> 03:23:46.482]  A communist, to me.
[03:23:46.482 --> 03:23:53.105]  I mean, I never saw a conversion, I never saw him, you know, write a paper saying how he regretted being a communist.
[03:23:53.105 --> 03:23:56.967]  Well, all of his actions have been to sell us out to China, so there you go.
[03:23:56.967 --> 03:23:57.547]  And Islam.
[03:23:59.549 --> 03:24:03.871]  I'm talking to folks that have confirmed they thought it was a fake conversion just to get the Saudis on board.
[03:24:03.871 --> 03:24:06.012]  No, he converted to Islam.
[03:24:06.012 --> 03:24:06.752]  Sure.
[03:24:06.752 --> 03:24:16.557]  And you know, this event last Friday with Nunez, he had a huge, really blockbuster interview with Maria Bartiromo.
[03:24:16.557 --> 03:24:20.419]  You know, when it counts, that woman has been stellar.
[03:24:20.419 --> 03:24:23.000]  I mean, she has got some nerve and guts.
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:30.605]  You know, even though she's on Fox Business News, when it counts, she's in the white hat corner, you can tell.
[03:24:30.605 --> 03:24:38.870]  And Núñez said that he didn't go over to the Department of Justice on Friday because he suspected he was being set up.
[03:24:38.870 --> 03:24:40.051]  And it's brilliant.
[03:24:40.051 --> 03:24:45.574]  I caught a little bit of rush earlier, and other people are talking about it.
[03:24:45.574 --> 03:24:48.156]  If he had gone over to the DOJ to get, you know,
[03:24:50.071 --> 03:24:55.102]  Dragged around the poll again over looking at the scope memo.
[03:24:55.102 --> 03:25:00.634]  These articles that dropped in the Washington Post and the New York Times were all timed.
[03:25:01.861 --> 03:25:16.874]  They would have followed the Núñez visit to the Department of Justice, then Núñez would have been cast as the leaker who outed our wonderful, brave, informant Stephen Halper, and Devin Núñez needs to be fired for good.
[03:25:16.874 --> 03:25:21.679]  So, either Devin Núñez has ESP, which is certainly possible.
[03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:28.863]  After being run around the bushes so many times, he's probably very skeptical, obviously.
[03:25:28.863 --> 03:25:31.605]  But I'll bet there's some white hats inside of DOJ.
[03:25:31.605 --> 03:25:32.586]  Oh, of course.
[03:25:32.586 --> 03:25:35.287]  It's like William Binney, when they were trying to set him up.
[03:25:35.287 --> 03:25:37.989]  He had somebody drop an envelope off at his house with all the evidence.
[03:25:37.989 --> 03:25:46.594]  I mean, that's why the globalists are in so much trouble, is that I'd say there's a good, what, 50% probably on the fence, just sitting back on their paycheck.
[03:25:46.594 --> 03:25:49.095]  And then of the other, it's 25 evil, 25 good.
[03:25:49.095 --> 03:25:51.497]  I mean, all I know is we know everything they're up to.
[03:25:53.550 --> 03:25:57.033]  Yeah, and it's clear we do, and we've known for quite a while.
[03:25:57.033 --> 03:26:01.697]  It's just, you know, it's also pretty amazing to me what a bunch of pansies they are.
[03:26:01.697 --> 03:26:06.100]  Even on Fox News, they still won't say the word Stephen Halper.
[03:26:06.100 --> 03:26:13.527]  I saw Roger Stone over the, I think it was over the weekend, but he was on, no, it was Friday night, I think, Thursday or Friday night.
[03:26:13.527 --> 03:26:14.928]  He was on with Laura Ingram.
[03:26:15.689 --> 03:26:19.172]  And he dropped the name, and I think she repeated it.
[03:26:19.172 --> 03:26:32.661]  And it was great because Roger also dropped that, yeah, as I said on InfoWars the other day, which was a completely gratuitous plug, that I was like cheering when he said that.
[03:26:32.661 --> 03:26:33.822]  That was great.
[03:26:33.822 --> 03:26:38.185]  You know, right on Fox News, you know, saying the unsayable.
[03:26:38.185 --> 03:26:41.327]  Stephen Halper and InfoWars all in the same paragraph.
[03:26:41.327 --> 03:26:41.848]  Exactly.
[03:26:43.223 --> 03:26:45.305]  Yeah, but this is quite a day.
[03:26:45.305 --> 03:26:51.970]  This is a real day for history, and I've actually prepared something that it's probably going to take me a full segment to give this little chat.
[03:26:51.970 --> 03:26:52.410]  I'm out of here.
[03:26:52.410 --> 03:26:54.572]  I'm just sitting here eating my lunch, watching you and listening, my friend.
[03:26:54.572 --> 03:26:55.733]  Take over.
[03:26:55.733 --> 03:26:56.113]  You bet.
[03:26:56.113 --> 03:26:59.876]  Thanks a lot.
[03:26:59.876 --> 03:27:01.557]  Well, we can do phone calls.
[03:27:01.557 --> 03:27:08.463]  I don't know how much time I have left in this segment, because I'm going to need... You have one minute, 30 seconds, so you can come back and do a nice 10-minute segment.
[03:27:08.463 --> 03:27:09.484]  I have another 10 minutes for calls.
[03:27:10.509 --> 03:27:11.750]  That's perfect.
[03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:19.475]  What a time to be alive, because we've been watching this for the last year, year and a half, playing out.
[03:27:19.475 --> 03:27:29.001]  We've known what was happening, but we've been watching these deep state operatives clinging to their plan, even though Hillary lost.
[03:27:29.001 --> 03:27:36.146]  The entire crossfire hurricane was predicated on Hillary wins, and we cover the whole thing up.
[03:27:36.146 --> 03:27:40.009]  Brennan stays at CIA, Lynch stays at DOJ.
[03:27:41.061 --> 03:27:45.702]  You know, we'll win the Congress and nothing will ever come of this.
[03:27:45.702 --> 03:27:50.143]  What a shock it must have been for them when Trump actually won.
[03:27:50.143 --> 03:27:52.623]  And what's going to come out now is going to be shocking.
[03:27:52.623 --> 03:28:01.805]  And I'm so gratified to see all of these Democrats, with very few exceptions, you know, just chaining themselves to the flaming wreckage of this plot.
[03:28:01.805 --> 03:28:04.826]  Because they are going to all crash into the mountain together.
[03:28:04.826 --> 03:28:06.806]  And there's going to be no saving them.
[03:28:06.806 --> 03:28:09.987]  In fact, if I was a Republican, I'd be asking any Democrat now,
[03:28:10.566 --> 03:28:15.130]  Do you denounce now these deep state plots against the president?
[03:28:15.130 --> 03:28:15.951]  That is genius.
[03:28:15.951 --> 03:28:17.272]  I'm going to steal that.
[03:28:17.272 --> 03:28:17.812]  Exactly.
[03:28:17.812 --> 03:28:21.535]  It's time for Democrats to either say they're on this train or off it.
[03:28:21.535 --> 03:28:23.377]  And they're all going to sign on and go over the edge.
[03:28:24.264 --> 03:28:26.825]  Yeah, down in flames.
[03:28:26.825 --> 03:28:32.946]  And it's much worse than spying, because they were using agents provocateurs to set people up.
[03:28:32.946 --> 03:28:40.188]  They were creating the illusion of collusion, and then they were leaking it to the media that there was collusion.
[03:28:40.188 --> 03:28:45.969]  So this is not only going to take the Democrats down, it's going to take the Democrat liberal media down.
[03:28:45.969 --> 03:28:46.850]  Matt Bracken's on fire.
[03:28:46.850 --> 03:28:48.430]  CNN is going to be nothing.
[03:28:48.430 --> 03:28:49.890]  Matt, everybody tune in right now.
[03:28:49.890 --> 03:28:50.811]  Everybody spread the word.
[03:28:50.811 --> 03:28:52.451]  Matt's going to come out and lay it all out.
[03:28:53.251 --> 03:29:04.639]  If you or anyone you love has been diagnosed with lung cancer, asbestosis, or mesothelioma, your diagnosis may be the result of job-related exposure to asbestos, and you may be entitled to compensation.

[03:29:09.883 --> 03:29:12.825]  How do you protect your rights and get the compensation you deserve?
[03:29:12.825 --> 03:29:14.486]  Call Capital Legal Group now at 800-400-LUNG.

[03:29:37.344 --> 03:29:37.924]  We're good to go.
[03:29:54.212 --> 03:29:58.196]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:29:58.196 --> 03:30:00.939]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.

[03:30:58.982 --> 03:31:09.173]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.

[03:31:53.988 --> 03:31:56.309]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:32:57.254 --> 03:33:15.630]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.630 --> 03:33:19.713]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:33:19.713 --> 03:33:23.917]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.113 --> 03:33:31.635]  So we're back and running it by myself right now.
[03:33:31.635 --> 03:33:33.316]  So have mercy on me.
[03:33:33.316 --> 03:33:35.477]  I'm just an amateur at this.
[03:33:35.477 --> 03:33:40.360]  The call-in numbers are, if you don't already have this on speed dial, 877-789-2539.
[03:33:40.360 --> 03:33:40.760]  That's 789-ALEX.
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:43.121]  And we'll go to calls maybe in the next segment.
[03:33:43.121 --> 03:33:45.763]  But I have a few announcements and then
[03:33:54.670 --> 03:33:57.811]  Then I've got a little talk I've already prepared.
[03:33:57.811 --> 03:34:01.112]  I just sort of have an outline of it.
[03:34:01.112 --> 03:34:08.653]  When I come on the show every other Monday, I usually put some of my books onto a Kindle free run so that they're a free download.
[03:34:08.653 --> 03:34:13.734]  Today, this book, Castigo Key, is free to download.
[03:34:13.734 --> 03:34:18.136]  It's the first of the novels that feature a new character.
[03:34:18.136 --> 03:34:24.217]  The new one is Red Cliffs, which is my very edgy counter-jihad novel.
[03:34:24.679 --> 03:34:26.861]  Very unpolitically correct.
[03:34:26.861 --> 03:34:36.050]  Something that, you know, you'll never see advertised in mainstream media or even reviewed on what I call, you know, Conservatism Inc.
[03:34:36.050 --> 03:34:41.435]  Those guys, you know, they're so far behind the curve, they consider me too far out in front.
[03:34:41.435 --> 03:34:43.317]  I'm always too far out in front.
[03:34:43.317 --> 03:34:45.519]  That's a problem when you're a novelist.
[03:34:45.519 --> 03:34:49.803]  By the time that reality catches up, I've already written another book that's still far out in front.
[03:34:50.646 --> 03:34:56.349]  And, you know, they'll look bad to review a book that's predicting today 15 years ago.
[03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:59.990]  So my novels just stand on their own reviews.
[03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:03.692]  I'm never going to be, you know, a mainstream household name.
[03:35:03.692 --> 03:35:05.913]  That's for sure.
[03:35:05.913 --> 03:35:20.159]  Anyway, today, as we watch this unfolding of the unraveling of the deep state coup, I'd like to sort of do a big picture analysis of where we are and what's really happening.
[03:35:20.982 --> 03:35:25.224]  And to do this, I've got to go back in time quite a bit.
[03:35:25.224 --> 03:35:29.965]  And in fact, I'm going to go, I'm going to go all the way back to the 1700s.
[03:35:29.965 --> 03:35:34.407]  And then bring it all the way forward to today.
[03:35:34.407 --> 03:35:40.149]  You know, the biggest mistake I think that Americans made, I was a Cold Warrior.
[03:35:40.149 --> 03:35:44.591]  My military time was during, during, you know, Reagan, that era.
[03:35:44.591 --> 03:35:48.392]  And when the Cold War was over, we thought that we won.
[03:35:49.199 --> 03:35:51.601]  America was on top of the pile.
[03:35:51.601 --> 03:35:53.683]  Communism was defeated.
[03:35:53.683 --> 03:35:55.144]  And we could coast.
[03:35:55.144 --> 03:35:56.445]  Maybe look for new enemies.
[03:35:56.445 --> 03:35:58.346]  Take it easy.
[03:35:58.346 --> 03:36:01.128]  Enjoy the peace dividend.
[03:36:01.128 --> 03:36:03.951]  And that was a huge, huge mistake.
[03:36:03.951 --> 03:36:09.395]  Because in reality, we didn't win the Cold War per se.
[03:36:09.395 --> 03:36:12.637]  We defeated the Soviet Union economically.
[03:36:12.637 --> 03:36:18.202]  But we did not defeat the idea of Marxism, Socialism, Communism.
[03:36:19.139 --> 03:36:29.988]  The idea just went internal, it went underground, it made a metamorphosis into some more modern forms, but it didn't disappear.
[03:36:29.988 --> 03:36:42.899]  Our mistake was to equate communism and the USSR, thinking that if the USSR, if the Soviet Union has collapsed, therefore communism has collapsed.
[03:36:42.899 --> 03:36:43.500]  But in fact,
[03:36:44.181 --> 03:36:46.042]  That is not what happened.
[03:36:46.042 --> 03:36:48.083]  And our victory was a hollow victory.
[03:36:48.083 --> 03:36:50.504]  It was a chimeric victory.
[03:36:50.504 --> 03:36:53.265]  The USSR was really just a vehicle.
[03:36:53.265 --> 03:37:01.128]  You know, Lenin launched communism in the Soviet Union in 1917 because it was available.
[03:37:01.128 --> 03:37:11.233]  You know, it was a shell on the back of World War I that was weak and his ideas could spread easily.
[03:37:11.233 --> 03:37:12.033]  He thought that
[03:37:12.944 --> 03:37:29.608]  When this revolution had succeeded in Russia, he would be able to use his Cheka, NKVD, what we now called KGB and now FSB, to foment revolutions country after country.
[03:37:29.608 --> 03:37:32.448]  That was his concept going into the 20s.
[03:37:32.448 --> 03:37:33.729]  But it didn't work.
[03:37:33.729 --> 03:37:40.130]  There was an Italian named Antonio Gramsci, who was probably much more far-seeing than Lenin,
[03:37:40.899 --> 03:37:47.743]  And what he believed was that Western people loved their countries too much.
[03:37:47.743 --> 03:37:49.004]  They loved their religion.
[03:37:49.004 --> 03:37:51.725]  They loved their societies.
[03:37:51.725 --> 03:38:00.591]  And before the revolutions could succeed in the rest of the world, those countries had to be sabotaged from within.
[03:38:00.591 --> 03:38:09.376]  The people had to be cut off from their roots, from their history, from their love for their countries, from their love for their religions.
[03:38:10.257 --> 03:38:14.418]  And he called it the Long March Through the Institutions.
[03:38:14.418 --> 03:38:17.139]  And that has succeeded wildly.
[03:38:17.139 --> 03:38:21.240]  So, sometimes I learn lessons from nature.
[03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:25.942]  You know, I love watching these nature shows.
[03:38:25.942 --> 03:38:36.525]  And one thing that came recently to me, I never even heard of this, but there's something out there called the parasitic or the parasitoid wasp.
[03:38:36.525 --> 03:38:38.946]  And there are thousands and thousands of species of these.
[03:38:39.804 --> 03:38:43.268]  And what these guys do is, they don't fight for a living.
[03:38:43.268 --> 03:38:48.254]  They just inject their eggs right into a fat, dumb, and happy caterpillar.
[03:38:48.254 --> 03:38:53.599]  So I created a meme, and the USA is that fat, dumb, and happy caterpillar.
[03:38:53.599 --> 03:38:56.583]  And even though the wasp is dead, guess what?
[03:38:57.051 --> 03:39:04.675]  Guess where little communists are being produced now, like those little wasps coming out of the dying caterpillar.
[03:39:04.675 --> 03:39:09.537]  They're being created and born right here, right in our own country.
[03:39:09.537 --> 03:39:15.640]  All you've got to do is look at our universities to see how we're pumping out little communists.
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:23.564]  Now, communism had a brand name problem based on the fact that more than 100 million people were murdered by communists in the 20th century.
[03:39:24.807 --> 03:39:30.111]  So they had a PR problem, and all they did was rebrand.
[03:39:30.111 --> 03:39:40.619]  So you can say, forget whether we call it communism, socialism, cultural Marxism, neo-Marxism, it's all the exact same thing.
[03:39:40.619 --> 03:39:48.745]  And that's what we're facing now is this burgeoning effect of these little hatchlings coming out
[03:39:49.318 --> 03:39:57.441]  They've been breeding inside, while on the outside we look like a nice, healthy caterpillar rolling along, munching the leaves.
[03:39:57.441 --> 03:40:02.583]  Inside, we're producing the next generation of little communist wasps.
[03:40:02.583 --> 03:40:04.624]  And you can see it happening.
[03:40:04.624 --> 03:40:12.907]  So anyway, there are a lot of the tactics that we see these neo-Marxists using.
[03:40:12.907 --> 03:40:14.888]  Obviously, they've taken over academia.
[03:40:14.888 --> 03:40:17.849]  This was straight out of the Gramscian Frankfurt School.
[03:40:18.687 --> 03:40:33.453]  Playbook, they have completely, I think I saw where something like 98% of college commencement speeches are by ultra liberals slash, you know, cultural Marxists.
[03:40:33.453 --> 03:40:38.735]  So they've absolutely won and dominated academia.
[03:40:38.735 --> 03:40:44.137]  Another way that, another thing that they do is they always are for open borders.
[03:40:44.137 --> 03:40:44.457]  Now they
[03:40:45.424 --> 03:40:48.027]  Dress this up as social justice.
[03:40:48.027 --> 03:40:52.191]  Obviously, if you think of it logically, the math just doesn't work.
[03:40:52.191 --> 03:41:00.539]  Two or three billion people would love to move to America, and that would be insane and would be our instant destruction if it happened.
[03:41:00.539 --> 03:41:05.864]  So why do these cultural Marxists, these neo-Marxists, want open borders?
[03:41:05.864 --> 03:41:06.185]  Because
[03:41:06.886 --> 03:41:26.699]  When third world people, not necessarily very intelligent, poor with lots of problems, when they move into our country, they not only will vote for whoever promises them the most, but they also require lots of government workers to tend them and manage and take care of them.
[03:41:26.699 --> 03:41:29.200]  So you can see what happens in California.
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:31.662]  That's the plan for the rest of the country.
[03:41:31.662 --> 03:41:34.624]  This is why the cultural Marxists hate the wall.
[03:41:35.570 --> 03:41:44.577]  You can strip away all of their terminology, whether they're liberals, whether they're Democrats, social justice warriors.
[03:41:44.577 --> 03:41:46.318]  They're Marxists.
[03:41:46.318 --> 03:41:48.300]  It's what they've always been.
[03:41:48.300 --> 03:41:52.162]  So, what can we do about this?
[03:41:52.162 --> 03:41:55.465]  First of all, educate ourselves.
[03:41:55.465 --> 03:41:58.027]  I've got four book recommendations.
[03:41:58.027 --> 03:41:59.928]  I wish that I could get everybody to read.
[03:42:02.105 --> 03:42:07.269]  The first of them, not many people have heard of, but maybe it's the most important.
[03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:11.252]  And it's called Hope of the Wicked by Ted Flynn.
[03:42:11.252 --> 03:42:20.499]  And it was written before 9-11, so it pretty much is the history of Marxism up to 9-11.
[03:42:20.499 --> 03:42:23.742]  And it goes right back to the earliest times
[03:42:24.668 --> 03:42:34.190]  When the Enlightenment happened and then man became divorced from God and some men began to think, you know, why don't we take over the role of God?
[03:42:34.190 --> 03:42:41.432]  The first guy that came up with this idea in a really cogent way was a man named Adam Weishaupt.
[03:42:41.432 --> 03:42:43.012]  And he lived in the 1700s.
[03:42:43.012 --> 03:42:49.033]  He came along around 10 years before Robespierre.
[03:42:49.033 --> 03:42:52.254]  And his lifespan also overlapped that of Karl Marx.
[03:42:53.507 --> 03:42:55.848]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:44:35.157 --> 03:44:35.638]  We're good.
[03:44:54.073 --> 03:45:04.683]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.683 --> 03:45:06.745]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.745 --> 03:45:09.607]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.607 --> 03:45:11.109]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.109 --> 03:45:17.935]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:45:17.935 --> 03:45:19.196]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:45:19.997 --> 03:45:29.705]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:29.705 --> 03:45:46.538]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:46:57.258 --> 03:46:59.879]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.188 --> 03:47:17.414]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[03:47:17.414 --> 03:47:26.501]  He is Alex Jones.
[03:47:26.501 --> 03:47:31.985]  I'm not Alex, but I'm sitting in for him today, this hour.
[03:47:31.985 --> 03:47:34.507]  And I'm sorry I ran right into another break.
[03:47:34.507 --> 03:47:35.968]  It seems to be my specialty.
[03:47:35.968 --> 03:47:36.689]  Sorry about that.
[03:47:37.284 --> 03:47:40.946]  But I was talking about the beginning of Marxism.
[03:47:40.946 --> 03:47:42.667]  This is really a secular religion.
[03:47:42.667 --> 03:47:47.070]  This is why we can't speak in terms of defeating it, like in the Cold War.
[03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:51.972]  Since we beat the Soviet Union, we've defeated communism, we can move on to the next thing.
[03:47:51.972 --> 03:47:54.073]  No, this is completely wrong.
[03:47:54.073 --> 03:48:05.500]  Going all the way back to Adam Weishaupt and the Illuminati, these guys, the Illuminists, influenced the French Jacobins, leading to the French Revolution.
[03:48:06.616 --> 03:48:08.517]  They also influenced Karl Marx.
[03:48:08.517 --> 03:48:13.478]  A lot of Marx's writings are taken straight from Weishaupt.
[03:48:13.478 --> 03:48:14.198]  Straight from it.
[03:48:14.198 --> 03:48:17.239]  It's almost like Karl Marx cribbed from him.
[03:48:17.239 --> 03:48:28.503]  So in a sense, Adam Weishaupt plus Karl Marx are sort of the Muhammad of the secular religion known as Marxism.
[03:48:28.503 --> 03:48:30.483]  They're the originators.
[03:48:30.483 --> 03:48:35.645]  And this is an absolute religion to a vast majority of people.
[03:48:36.329 --> 03:48:48.093]  Not in maybe a vast majority of people, but certainly the most influential religious force of the last 200 years has been the secular religion of Marxism.
[03:48:48.093 --> 03:48:51.855]  You can see this, even the Pope today is a Marxist.
[03:48:51.855 --> 03:49:00.538]  There are pictures where he's being given a hammer and sickle, a cross hammer and sickle, and he's grinning.
[03:49:00.538 --> 03:49:01.078]  He is a
[03:49:04.557 --> 03:49:06.878]  You know, a Marxist for sure.
[03:49:06.878 --> 03:49:13.983]  So we can see that even within an institution like the Catholic Church, Marx is ascendant.
[03:49:13.983 --> 03:49:16.464]  Which seems amazing, but it's true.
[03:49:16.464 --> 03:49:25.170]  So the next book on my list, probably most people here are familiar with it, Creature from Jekyll Island is the foundation of the Federal Reserve System.
[03:49:25.170 --> 03:49:27.351]  This is sort of the deep state of bankers.
[03:49:27.351 --> 03:49:31.514]  This is the cabal that's really pulling the strings in Congress.
[03:49:31.514 --> 03:49:33.395]  You know, the laws that are passed are passed
[03:49:34.088 --> 03:49:44.436]  On the behalf of these bankers, everybody's familiar, I hope, with Ed Griffin's Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:49:44.436 --> 03:49:49.640]  The next book, American Betrayal, fabulous book by Diana West.
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:50.041]  This came out in 2013.
[03:49:50.041 --> 03:49:50.781]  It goes back to FDR and his
[03:49:57.566 --> 03:50:01.748]  Desire to converge the United States and communism.
[03:50:01.748 --> 03:50:22.559]  He didn't come out and say that, but all of the advisors around him, he surrounded himself with communist agents, such as Harry Hopkins, Harry Dexter White, Alger Hiss, all of the leading people around FDR were basically working on behalf of the Soviet Union and communism.
[03:50:23.866 --> 03:50:28.167]  FDR dies, we win World War II, everybody considers him a great hero.
[03:50:28.167 --> 03:50:30.567]  But in many respects, he was a traitor.
[03:50:30.567 --> 03:50:38.389]  He was working to converge our free market system and a communist, Soviet-style system.
[03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:47.710]  And even though we had hearings in the 50s, and everybody's familiar with Joe McCarthy, in a sense, the communists were never defeated.
[03:50:47.710 --> 03:50:50.651]  They just burrowed deeper and deeper inside.
[03:50:51.491 --> 03:51:00.359]  You can see that this is true because in 1976, John Brennan votes for the communist candidate for president, Gus Hall.
[03:51:00.359 --> 03:51:03.281]  This is when people were being dragged off to gulags still.
[03:51:03.281 --> 03:51:05.603]  This was the height of the Cold War.
[03:51:05.603 --> 03:51:08.606]  In 1980, John Brennan joins the CIA.
[03:51:08.606 --> 03:51:11.988]  He admits on polygraph that he voted for a communist.
[03:51:11.988 --> 03:51:13.370]  Does he get thrown out?
[03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:15.651]  Do they tar and feather him?
[03:51:15.651 --> 03:51:17.973]  Do they beat him and chuck him onto the street?
[03:51:17.973 --> 03:51:19.014]  No.
[03:51:19.014 --> 03:51:19.735]  Absolutely not.
[03:51:21.303 --> 03:51:25.207]  He eventually rises to become the head of the CIA.
[03:51:25.207 --> 03:51:34.356]  This is back to my parasitic wasp, you know, injecting these little incubi of Marxism within our body.
[03:51:34.356 --> 03:51:36.998]  And that's where we are today.
[03:51:36.998 --> 03:51:39.361]  The last book on the list is not that well known.
[03:51:39.361 --> 03:51:43.084]  It's See Something Say Nothing by Phil Haney.
[03:51:43.084 --> 03:51:44.385]  And this is pretty current.
[03:51:44.385 --> 03:51:45.306]  This is, you know, post 9-11.
[03:51:46.567 --> 03:51:53.632]  This Islam and Jihad expert is doing fantastic work within the Department of Homeland Security.
[03:51:53.632 --> 03:52:00.076]  He and everybody like him are purged when Obama comes in, and even before Obama, it began under Bush.
[03:52:00.076 --> 03:52:06.720]  They're purged and replaced with Imams from the Muslim Brotherhood, you know, front groups like CARE.
[03:52:07.532 --> 03:52:12.314]  So this subversion from within is continuing right to today.
[03:52:12.314 --> 03:52:20.658]  So it's no wonder that these deep state coup plotters have felt that they could just seize the reins of power.
[03:52:20.658 --> 03:52:30.243]  And it's not a wonder to me that we are where we are today, because the real power within this country is in the hands of these subversives.
[03:52:31.565 --> 03:52:39.070]  And I don't know what more we can do other than ensure that Trump doesn't get kicked out of office.
[03:52:39.070 --> 03:52:40.211]  Vote for Republicans.
[03:52:40.211 --> 03:52:44.654]  Hold your nose and vote for Republicans so that he can't be impeached.
[03:52:44.654 --> 03:52:45.875]  That's about all we can do.
[03:52:45.875 --> 03:52:49.297]  Otherwise, I don't see any hope for us.
[03:52:49.297 --> 03:52:52.359]  But, you know, today is a big day.
[03:52:52.359 --> 03:52:55.201]  Maybe Trump is going to fire Rod Rosenstein.
[03:52:55.201 --> 03:52:57.423]  We'll have to see what happens, but we need to support him.
[03:52:58.373 --> 03:53:14.140]  Now, I'm not sure if we have time for a caller, but I've finished my little chat, and I'd like to see number three, Jay from San Francisco.
[03:53:14.140 --> 03:53:15.280]  Are you on?
[03:53:15.280 --> 03:53:16.261]  Can I talk to Jay?
[03:53:16.261 --> 03:53:20.122]  Is Jay holding?
[03:53:20.122 --> 03:53:23.304]  Hello?
[03:53:23.304 --> 03:53:23.944]  Jay, go ahead.
[03:53:25.074 --> 03:53:40.645]  Yeah, I was calling to ask you about the SES and how Trump could root those elements out of the government, which I think goes to your point about the subversives that are in our government.
[03:53:40.645 --> 03:53:42.066]  How could he do that?
[03:53:42.066 --> 03:53:44.168]  How is that possible?
[03:53:44.168 --> 03:53:49.492]  I think that we need to bring this battle right out into the open and lance the boil.
[03:53:49.492 --> 03:53:53.515]  And then as these little bugs come out, we need to crush them one at a time.
[03:53:54.264 --> 03:53:55.824]  And we need to call them traitors.
[03:53:55.824 --> 03:53:58.165]  We shouldn't be polite.
[03:53:58.165 --> 03:54:02.206]  When the Soviet Union collapsed, there were no Nuremberg trials.
[03:54:02.206 --> 03:54:10.889]  It was just a nice, quiet... The Bushes were just, let's get along with Gorbachev, let's not talk about the bad old days.
[03:54:10.889 --> 03:54:12.009]  We need to crush them.
[03:54:12.009 --> 03:54:14.430]  We need to drag them out and have trials.
[03:54:14.430 --> 03:54:16.910]  This to me is complete treason.
[03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:19.291]  Now there's no communist conspiracy per se.
[03:54:19.813 --> 03:54:21.974]  So people say, Bracken, what are you talking about?
[03:54:21.974 --> 03:54:22.974]  Conspiracy.
[03:54:22.974 --> 03:54:24.995]  The Soviet Union was defeated.
[03:54:24.995 --> 03:54:28.116]  But this is an enemy subversive ideology.
[03:54:28.116 --> 03:54:32.577]  This is what why James Comey called his book a higher loyalty.
[03:54:32.577 --> 03:54:44.581]  What he means is higher than the United States, higher than our Constitution, because his loyalty is to this global socialist new world order and nationalists like Trump
[03:54:45.160 --> 03:54:45.320]  Are we?
[03:55:03.835 --> 03:55:08.078]  And crush them to the greatest extent possible.
[03:55:08.078 --> 03:55:14.301]  We can't just let them fly under the radar for another generation like the traitors of the 1930s.
[03:55:14.301 --> 03:55:18.604]  They were never punished, except for the Rosenbergs and a few others like that.
[03:55:18.604 --> 03:55:20.545]  They need to be punished.
[03:55:20.545 --> 03:55:29.090]  At least humiliated, disgraced, and thrown out of normal society.
[03:55:29.090 --> 03:55:31.031]  Anyway, let's see.
[03:55:33.143 --> 03:55:38.106]  Vincent in Nevada, you've got a question about the Pope.
[03:55:38.106 --> 03:55:40.247]  I call him Pope Marx.
[03:55:40.247 --> 03:55:41.768]  Go ahead.
[03:55:41.768 --> 03:55:43.849]  Well, and that goes to the heart of my question.
[03:55:43.849 --> 03:55:52.995]  I was actually hoping to talk to Alex earlier because I think there's an important guest that maybe you or Alex should have on, but the reality is he's not a Pope.
[03:55:52.995 --> 03:55:56.637]  He's an anti-Pope, along with many of the Popes before him.
[03:55:57.102 --> 03:56:03.704]  And your analogy regarding the Caterpillar is critical, because these people have infiltrated the Catholic Church.
[03:56:03.704 --> 03:56:05.525]  They are not Catholic at all.
[03:56:05.525 --> 03:56:14.127]  This is part of something that was warned about by Our Lady of Fatima in October of 1917, immediately before Lenin came aboard.
[03:56:14.127 --> 03:56:19.869]  And the idea that I have for a guest, which I don't know if you or Alex would be willing to have,
[03:56:20.362 --> 03:56:21.523]  Yeah, we're running out of time.
[03:56:45.265 --> 03:56:55.648]  You can find me on Twitter, MattBracken48 on Twitter, and I'll look in notifications or if you dig around for my public email you might find it.
[03:56:55.648 --> 03:57:05.951]  But listen, it's interesting, the last Pope didn't die, he didn't have dementia, he was thrown out in a Vatican Palace coup by leftist socialist cardinals.
[03:57:05.951 --> 03:57:14.393]  So yeah, this Marxist upswelling is in all of our institutions, even the Catholic Church.
[03:57:15.976 --> 03:57:17.437]  Thanks there, Vincent.
[03:57:17.437 --> 03:57:20.038]  I think we're going to a break now.
[03:57:20.038 --> 03:57:24.020]  And it's the top of the hour, so I'm not sure what the next plan is.
[03:57:47.179 --> 03:57:52.904]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:57:52.904 --> 03:58:00.770]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:58:00.770 --> 03:58:03.933]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:58:04.113 --> 03:58:09.400]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:12.184]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
