[00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:14.815]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.136]  It is Thursday, my friends, the 31st day of May 2018.
[00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:21.037]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours, as we are every weekday.
[00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:23.118]  Then I return Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:55.175]  This vote by the Congress, after decades of them trying to pass it, and Trump signing it yesterday of the Right to Try Act, is incredibly illustrative of the true spirit of the Democrats, who want a bunch of hopeless slaves.
[00:00:56.396 --> 00:01:08.042]  The fact that they would openly push government-funded assisted suicide of people that want to die, state-controlled euthanasia,
[00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:20.832]  But are against people who are terminal being able to fight for their lives is 110% illustrative of their mindset and their code and who they are.
[00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:32.878]  We're going to look at that today and some of their statements and then those statements of MSNBC, CNBC and CNN just all saying Trump is a racist, Trump is a demon, Trump is a bad guy.
[00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:35.579]  This is all they've got.
[00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:45.336]  Over and over and over again when Trump clearly cares about people across the board and is trying to bring common sense and prosperity back.
[00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:45.856]  It's amazing.
[00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:56.820]  He's just arrived in Houston and he's going to be speaking there with the victims and family members of the tragic Santa Fe shooting a few weeks ago.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.481]  We're going to be covering all of that live.
[00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.101]  We have our own satellite feed of that.
[00:02:03.442 --> 00:02:05.943]  So we'll be breaking it all down.
[00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.733]  And we're also going to have Owen Schroyer in studio.
[00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:17.878]  He is going to go out and lead a demonstration outside Planned Parenthood to point out what the real mass murder is going on.
[00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.120]  Yeah, you've got between 46 and 56.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.324]  It varies year to year, the average, but it's never above 60 people killed in mass shootings at school.
[00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:27.025]  So that's too many.
[00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.686]  And it's a new phenomenon since 1999.
[00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:35.951]  But the media hyping it, psychologists admit, creates this idea in mentally ill people that it's an option.
[00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:37.744]  They want to be famous.
[00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:39.085]  They want to get attention.
[00:02:56.974 --> 00:02:59.596]  Guns to protect ourselves from these type of folks.
[00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:10.365]  We can't let these demons engaging in bizarre sickening mass murder, whether they're using a baseball bat or a knife or a truck or explosives or firearms.
[00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:13.487]  We can't then penalize the rest of the population.
[00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:14.668]  Shock footage.
[00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.369]  Nicholas Cruz vows to shoot up school.
[00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.811]  You're all going to die, says Parkland gunman.
[00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.593]  He bragged about this for years.
[00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:25.697]  You're going to see the sickening and hear the sickening demon, the golem-like
[00:03:26.693 --> 00:03:34.157]  Gremlin-like, on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, been in government custody for years, been in foster care his whole life.
[00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:35.158]  Parents were dead.
[00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:36.359]  Foster parents.
[00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:44.283]  He was in a promise program where he could threaten and steal and rob and vandalize however he wanted.
[00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:45.244]  He was in the liberal program.
[00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:47.625]  His last name was Cruz, even though he's not Hispanic.
[00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:50.047]  His adoptive family was Hispanic.
[00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:53.309]  And he was allowed to do it.
[00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.010]  And the Sheriff's Department stood down and did it.
[00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.240]  You want to hear the media talk about that?
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.341]  Now the police stand down over and over and over and over again in blue state areas.
[00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:05.583]  Hell, you'll just hear misrepresentations about what really happened.
[00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:15.408]  That said, there's six or seven people have access to my Twitter, and we've contacted the folks in the office and no one did it, so we're gonna have to change the codes.
[00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:18.429]  This shows how deep the manipulation's going.
[00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.950]  There's news articles out there from Twitchy and others.
[00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.852]  Wow, so-owned, Kyle Kashuv,
[00:04:25.987 --> 00:04:31.268]  Drops Alex Jones in just five words and all is right with the world.
[00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:36.810]  And so someone saying they were me, barely know that Kyle Cashew guy is.
[00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.611]  I can't understand that these tweets back and forth and they call this owning me.
[00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:45.032]  So somebody got the code to my Twitter.
[00:04:46.274 --> 00:04:49.876]  You always hear about this happening, but somebody got it and did this.
[00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:51.457]  We're having to change the codes right now.
[00:04:52.337 --> 00:04:57.340]  There's just no end to the lengths people will go to to tie me to harassing shooting victims.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.741]  It's just all part of the narrative they push.
[00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:00.762]  I don't know who's behind this.
[00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:01.843]  They'll be right back.
[00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:02.183]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:07.253]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:08.835]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.578]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:05:10.838 --> 00:05:13.242]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:05:13.282 --> 00:05:14.223]  We've beaten six.
[00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:16.487]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:17.889]  You're my soldier.
[00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:18.650]  We're all in this together.
[00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:24.394]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:25.794]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:37.021]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, Ford slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:39.202]  And when you financially go to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:45.526]  When you take advantage of the huge sales and the great products for everything in your life, it's about making your life better.
[00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:48.348]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds, springtime's here.
[00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:52.830]  The highest quality books, films, pastry apparel to spread the word.
[00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:58.674]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[00:05:59.074 --> 00:06:01.256]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:01.616 --> 00:06:02.837]  Please shop with the good guys.
[00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:23.937]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.819]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.804 --> 00:06:30.645]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.893]  We are set to probably have Dinesh D'Souza on the broadcast today.
[00:06:36.494 --> 00:06:38.355]  He was just pardoned by the President.
[00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:42.699]  The President announced the pardon when he boarded Air Force One in D.C.
[00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:53.428]  to fly to Houston, Texas, where he's now landed and is going to be visiting with the victims and the survivors and the parents of the tragic Santa Fe shooting a few weeks ago.
[00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.151]  He's announced a full pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today.
[00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.970]  He was treated very, very unfairly by our government.
[00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.710]  Absolutely true.
[00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.053]  Trump also considering pardon for Martha Stewart, whom Comey falsely prosecuted.
[00:07:07.634 --> 00:07:20.960]  In a complete stunt where he protects all the real organized crime, but then does these type of persecutions just for PR of someone like Martha Stewart who did absolutely nothing wrong.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.362]  If you look at the Dinesh D'Souza case, he got five friends
[00:07:26.977 --> 00:07:35.342]  To donate money to a Senate candidate that he'd been best friends with in college, who was running for Hillary Clinton's old seat.
[00:07:37.743 --> 00:07:48.269]  She subsequently lost the person she was running against, and then it came out in divorce papers that Dinesh had refunded the money to his friends.
[00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:56.254]  So you're talking about a crooked toenail compared to what Hillary does, and all the hundreds of millions of dollars of laundered money that's confirmed through her foundation.
[00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:57.876]  It's amazing.
[00:07:58.336 --> 00:07:59.697]  So that's a good pardon there.
[00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:03.601]  Great pardon we saw with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:13.971]  Good to see Trump using that power of the executive branch to X out a lot of these travesties of justice that are taking place.
[00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:20.917]  Now, there's something very, very illustrative of where we stand as a culture and a society.
[00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:29.117]  And in the hustle and bustle and fast-moving pace of our universe, I don't want people to lose sight of what happened yesterday.
[00:08:30.918 --> 00:08:47.203]  And however you understand this point, you understand basically everything about the globalists, about leftists, about eugenicists, about the type of people that push the domestication of populations, not to empower them, but to enslave them.
[00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:51.705]  And I'm speaking about the signing of the Right to Try Bill.
[00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:55.557]  All over the world, they push the right to die.
[00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:59.319]  And I tend to agree that if you don't want to have treatment and just want to die, that's your right.
[00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:07.943]  And quite frankly, I can imagine in some really, really bad cases where people, I don't blame them, commit suicide.
[00:09:09.063 --> 00:09:11.945]  But you do not want the state
[00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:17.583]  ever involved in the implementation of euthanasia.
[00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:29.328]  Because then it becomes, as it did in Nazi Germany, a way where they just get rid of people and pretty soon it's the mentally retarded, it's people that are crippled, disabled, all the rest of it.
[00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:34.210]  The left says don't call them crippled, call them disabled, but they don't want to give them treatment and want to kill them in the womb.
[00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:41.233]  So the left famously wants taxpayers to even pay for state-sponsored
[00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:43.441]  Euthanasia.
[00:09:44.322 --> 00:09:44.782]  Suicide.
[00:09:46.883 --> 00:10:07.091]  And they've got famous national Dutch television showing well-functioning Down syndrome man that he cost the state way more money than the general public does in a socialist type system and then the man is meant to feel bad about himself and Europe's moving to forcibly make you abort Down syndrome
[00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:12.887]  Babies, that means government screening of the genetics, and the next it's going to be everything else as we know.
[00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:17.989]  The whole psychiatric tyranny calls, even resisting tyranny, mental illness.
[00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.571]  So we know the eugenics angle of this.
[00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:22.851]  We know about the bioethics boards.
[00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:26.473]  We know about the Thomas AI computers coming in all over the world to take over health care.
[00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:37.698]  And so Trump comes in and says, well, if you're already terminal, and you're stage 4 cancer, or Lou Gehrig's, or ALS, or any of these things, and you choose
[00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:48.146]  To be able to take a treatment that may have bad side effects, that may even kill you, you have a right to do that.
[00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:57.788]  And Big Pharma is the one that wrote the laws like this to keep their competition from coming in and also make sure there aren't treatments way better than their treatments and even cures available.
[00:10:58.229 --> 00:10:59.069]  And that's well documented.
[00:10:59.089 --> 00:11:02.390]  Everybody knows about suppressed technology, not just in the medical area.
[00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.630]  Now, that said,
[00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:10.092]  What Trump did, and I've looked at the bill, if anything isn't strong enough.
[00:11:10.213 --> 00:11:10.973]  He said that too.
[00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:15.174]  He said it'd still be average of two, three years for a lot of things to get approved.
[00:11:15.714 --> 00:11:22.316]  And he said, but this will at least allow people that are terminal to be able to go through the process of seeing if it works and helps them.
[00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:34.900]  And then yes, by being volunteer guinea pigs, quite frankly, dedicating their bodies to science while they're still alive, they will then undoubtedly save potentially millions of people in one breakthrough alone, globally.
[00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:36.513]  And so the U.S.
[00:11:36.573 --> 00:11:37.634]  is way behind on medicine.
[00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:44.576]  We used to be the forefront because of these rules the last 30 years that were put in there to hamper us, part of the globalist sabotage, which is in their own admissions.
[00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:58.582]  But the left's hissing, hateful, disgusting responses of calling him a racist and saying he wants to guinea pig people without their knowledge or that he wants to kill people is so criminal.
[00:11:58.882 --> 00:11:59.843]  They want you hopeless.
[00:11:59.883 --> 00:12:00.803]  They want you alone.
[00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:03.084]  They don't want real progress.
[00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:09.494]  Because the elites can go to their own, you know, offshore, swish, medical facilities and others.
[00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:14.018]  And they really want a regressive healthcare system, not a progressive one.
[00:12:14.939 --> 00:12:18.221]  That's why under the National Health Service, a little girl has a leg four inches shorter.
[00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:26.129]  It's about a 5,000 pound, I kept saying dollar, about a 5,000 pound, that's about $8,000 surgery.
[00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:28.631]  And they just said, no, we'll just cut your leg off.
[00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:40.707]  So, oh, if you want to get a sex change or hormone treatment for a five-year-old boy who thinks he's a girl, we'll pay for that at the National Health Service, or liberal areas like San Francisco will.
[00:12:40.747 --> 00:12:43.708]  But if you want your leg fixed, sweetheart, we're going to cut it off.
[00:12:44.048 --> 00:12:49.890]  Or if you want to have life-saving experimental treatments, we're not going to let you do that.
[00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.410]  So it's all this virtue signaling, but it's true evil.
[00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:55.051]  So an article
[00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:56.408]  I think?
[00:13:05.973 --> 00:13:07.794]  Go over it, but here's one of the headlines.
[00:13:08.215 --> 00:13:12.898]  Dems attack Trump for signing right to try drug bill into law.
[00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.180]  And it's got a bunch of examples of the Democratic Party.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.002]  They voted against it in the House and Senate along party lines.
[00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:21.084]  Democrats side with FDA over terminal patients.
[00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:23.006]  That's out of the Mises Institute.
[00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:24.847]  That's endorsed what the president did.
[00:13:26.008 --> 00:13:27.449]  It's just crazy.
[00:13:27.469 --> 00:13:32.453]  Despite skepticism, family behind right to try law, hopeful it will save lives.
[00:13:32.553 --> 00:13:34.734]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:13:36.109 --> 00:14:01.003]  The government can kill you if you're terminal, or even if you're depressed, and we'll have taxpayers pay for it in some areas, some states, and Europe pushes it, but if you're dying, think about this, and you want to take an experimental drug, the left doesn't want to let you universally across the world, because they're control freaks, they're inherently evil.
[00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:05.253]  So we're going to look at all that more today.
[00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:06.594]  It's simply amazing.
[00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:11.036]  And then we have the most chilling, disgusting, frightening, demonic footage.
[00:14:11.356 --> 00:14:12.116]  But it's got to be heard.
[00:14:12.156 --> 00:14:12.897]  It's got to be seen.
[00:14:13.497 --> 00:14:16.819]  Of shocking statements by Nicholas Cruz, released last night.
[00:14:16.859 --> 00:14:18.019]  They're on Infowars.com.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.341]  Two-minute video talking about what he was going to do.
[00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.622]  This is the true face of evil and why we have guns to protect ourselves.
[00:14:23.923 --> 00:14:24.623]  They stood down.
[00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:26.024]  They knew what the monster was planning.
[00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:27.885]  They stood down on every level.
[00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:29.786]  He was on drugs, government-issued drugs.
[00:14:29.826 --> 00:14:33.810]  He was in a liberal program where he could commit crimes called the Promise Program and not locked up.
[00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.031]  He was known as the school shooter.
[00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:36.632]  He constantly threatened everyone.
[00:14:36.852 --> 00:14:38.613]  He took toy guns to schools and threatened to kill them.
[00:14:39.974 --> 00:14:41.716]  And they stood down again and then blamed all gun owners.
[00:14:43.993 --> 00:14:49.035]  And then lied and said that I said no one died at Parkland and that they were all crisis actors.
[00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.135]  And the media ran with more lies of that today.
[00:14:51.235 --> 00:14:52.176]  This is the true evil.
[00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.456]  But you heard what I really said.
[00:14:54.056 --> 00:14:58.618]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back with the Nick Cruz footage as soon as Trump gets with the families.
[00:14:58.918 --> 00:15:00.759]  We'll go to that live as well today.
[00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:01.719]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:15:02.978 --> 00:15:04.439]  We have a lot of important guests joining us.
[00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:07.200]  We're going to try to save some lives as well at the bottom of the hour.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.142]  With Owen Schroer, very important thing he's launching coming up tomorrow.
[00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:13.022]  We'll cover lives, so please stay with us for that.
[00:15:13.422 --> 00:15:15.683]  This is critical of those short notice people come out to this.
[00:15:16.064 --> 00:15:19.485]  We're going to be out there at the death camp Planned Parenthood operation.
[00:15:20.365 --> 00:15:25.688]  Before we go to break, just remember we have free shipping on all of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements.
[00:15:26.704 --> 00:15:26.884]  I don't
[00:15:41.664 --> 00:15:42.244]  We're good to go.
[00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:22.795]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:22.896 --> 00:16:28.819]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:30.419]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:33.141]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:34.762]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.302 --> 00:16:36.442]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:38.383]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.403 --> 00:16:44.106]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:44.206 --> 00:16:45.406]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.426 --> 00:16:47.367]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:49.828]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:50.028 --> 00:16:51.309]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:53.270]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.430]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.851]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.430]  Round 1.
[00:18:04.151 --> 00:18:04.791]  Fight Trump.
[00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:08.373]  The game where you deal for everything you ever wanted to own.
[00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:08.794]  Yes!
[00:18:08.974 --> 00:18:09.554]  Fight Trump.
[00:18:09.674 --> 00:18:10.935]  The game from Milton Bradley.
[00:18:11.055 --> 00:18:11.836]  I think you'll like it.
[00:18:11.856 --> 00:18:14.257]  I don't know how you feel about this, but keep a gun in your house.
[00:18:14.317 --> 00:18:18.300]  If you think someone's gonna assault you or rape you, blow their head off, man!
[00:18:20.864 --> 00:18:22.785]  Kinnison was born in Peoria, Illinois.
[00:18:23.045 --> 00:18:27.288]  He died when a pickup truck slammed into his car near Needles, California last night.
[00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:32.571]  The body of Nirvana's lead singer and songwriter was found today in a guest cottage at his Seattle home.
[00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:37.254]  The medical examiner says he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
[00:18:37.434 --> 00:18:40.135]  All of a sudden, police brutality had a human face.
[00:18:40.455 --> 00:18:45.879]  The face belonged to Rodney King, a black male being brutally beaten and kissed by Los Angeles police officers.
[00:18:50.743 --> 00:18:52.385]  Oh, look at that.
[00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:53.466]  Terrible!
[00:18:53.807 --> 00:18:55.588]  And there's no police presence down here.
[00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:56.710]  Nobody's helping us.
[00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.311]  This is attempted murder.
[00:18:58.331 --> 00:19:04.998]  The three merchants walked out of the store, so they just started firing at everybody and anybody.
[00:19:13.568 --> 00:19:15.069]  That's not right!
[00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.110]  That's not right!
[00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.731]  You man's a white man!
[00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:19.892]  Why are you doing my business?
[00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:20.592]  Kicked in the head.
[00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:21.953]  He's laying in the street.
[00:19:21.993 --> 00:19:23.834]  Terrible, terrible pictures.
[00:19:24.175 --> 00:19:26.256]  All this guy did was enter this area.
[00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:27.477]  Hit the siren, Doug.
[00:19:28.657 --> 00:19:28.917]  It's fun.
[00:19:28.997 --> 00:19:29.818]  It's fun.
[00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:10.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:28.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.262]  So, there's an article out.
[00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:38.403]  It's up on Infowars.com, out of the hill.
[00:20:39.784 --> 00:20:43.786]  Obama compared Trump to a cartoon shortly after the election.
[00:20:44.807 --> 00:20:50.091]  He also said, you know, Trump can't get the economy up above 2.9%, just Obama couldn't.
[00:20:50.491 --> 00:20:52.633]  He said, what are you going to do, wave a magic wand?
[00:20:54.074 --> 00:21:03.901]  No, he just removed some of the artificial barriers there that no other country had on itself that tilted the playing field against us with an uphill battle.
[00:21:06.076 --> 00:21:13.386]  And even the Washington Post has to admit today in a headline, thank Trump and thank the Republicans for the Right to Try Bill.
[00:21:13.967 --> 00:21:14.748]  It's going to shave.
[00:21:15.697 --> 00:21:28.727]  Really millions of lives, because it's going to find a lot of cures on people that are already terminal, have no other choice, and it'll help a lot of them, but it also will let us know, with human trials accelerated, what is going to help others.
[00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:38.095]  That could mean your daughter, your son, your father, your mother, your brother, your sister, your aunt, your uncle, your neighbor, your pastor, your friend, your lover.
[00:21:40.177 --> 00:21:41.618]  And it's nothing but a good thing.
[00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:44.040]  A free choice.
[00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:50.518]  Because I don't like suicide and I don't like endorsing it because the state gets involved, and that's evil.
[00:21:51.398 --> 00:21:54.419]  But you can't be a hypocrite about folks that commit suicide because they're in great pain.
[00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:59.560]  Well, if you're gonna have a right to die, you gotta have a right to fight.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.240]  Right to try.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.201]  And it's so incredibly illustrative.
[00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:12.803]  Now, let's move into something that I wanna just say, viewer discretion,
[00:22:14.867 --> 00:22:15.487]  Is advised.
[00:22:16.148 --> 00:22:27.632]  There's no profanity, but it's so chilling and so sickening and so pathetically weak that it puts a chill in my bones.
[00:22:29.312 --> 00:22:36.415]  It puts a nauseous feeling in the pit of my stomach, but I'm going to air this because this is why we have guns.
[00:22:37.175 --> 00:22:39.036]  This is why we have a right to self-defense.
[00:22:39.916 --> 00:22:41.657]  Mass shootings did not exist in schools.
[00:22:44.392 --> 00:22:45.112]  Until 1999.
[00:22:45.353 --> 00:22:48.034]  You had a few gang related things here and there, but that was it.
[00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:53.557]  But you didn't have people going to purposely kill a bunch of people to get their name in the news and be killed.
[00:22:55.698 --> 00:23:00.860]  Now, even mainline psychologists and psychiatrists are on record.
[00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:05.923]  You have the same M.O., you have incels that don't feel like girls like them.
[00:23:08.544 --> 00:23:13.126]  They're into violent shoot-em-up games, which habituate them to killing.
[00:23:13.427 --> 00:23:17.469]  Shoot-em-up games were invented during Vietnam to get people to shoot folks up close.
[00:23:17.489 --> 00:23:19.490]  Because about half the troops wouldn't do it up close.
[00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.572]  About 10% wouldn't shoot somebody at a thousand yards.
[00:23:23.312 --> 00:23:23.872]  Just couldn't do it.
[00:23:24.192 --> 00:23:25.453]  They'd miss on purpose.
[00:23:26.934 --> 00:23:29.115]  They would hesitate at the key moment, and they would be dead marine.
[00:23:29.495 --> 00:23:30.456]  To quote Full Metal Jacket.
[00:23:31.997 --> 00:23:34.378]  But in this case, with Cruz,
[00:23:36.604 --> 00:23:39.286]  And in every other case, they're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:23:39.306 --> 00:23:40.506]  That's been confirmed about him.
[00:23:41.227 --> 00:23:43.248]  He was in government foster homes his whole life.
[00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:47.531]  He was in a promise program protecting him where he could do whatever he wanted.
[00:23:47.971 --> 00:23:53.835]  Commit crimes, commit burglaries, commit assaults, commit vandalism.
[00:23:54.435 --> 00:23:57.217]  He was protected since 2013.
[00:23:57.837 --> 00:24:00.739]  Four plus years to do whatever he wanted.
[00:24:03.263 --> 00:24:05.404]  And so he built this up as his identity.
[00:24:05.424 --> 00:24:07.384]  He was known at the school as the school shooter.
[00:24:07.864 --> 00:24:08.984]  He kept threatening it for years.
[00:24:09.585 --> 00:24:10.105]  That's on record.
[00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:11.925]  The police were called more than 20 times.
[00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:13.185]  The FBI three times.
[00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:14.826]  They stood down that day.
[00:24:16.286 --> 00:24:21.067]  The main security officer who was over the training, where they had drills the month before, he stood down.
[00:24:21.187 --> 00:24:22.908]  He just gets his $8,700 a month starting this month.
[00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:27.879]  Thirty-seven, thirty-nine times.
[00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:30.802]  Excuse me, I was saying twenty-something here and three here.
[00:24:30.822 --> 00:24:32.845]  It was thirty-nine times.
[00:24:32.865 --> 00:24:35.207]  Let's put that back on screen for TV viewers, please.
[00:24:35.668 --> 00:24:37.870]  CBS Miami, thirty-nine times.
[00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:40.533]  Law enforcement went to Nicholas Cruz's home, thirty-nine times.
[00:24:40.594 --> 00:24:42.155]  So, this is a guy
[00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:45.352]  We need to institutionalize or execute.
[00:24:45.852 --> 00:24:46.913]  But no, no, no, no, no!
[00:24:47.233 --> 00:25:00.899]  The left at every level enabled, and protected, and stood down, and put him on the drugs, and put him in psychiatric care, and turned him loose when he said, I'm gonna kill people, and then he got a gun illegally, magically, and he goes and attacks the school where they stand down.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.601]  Now why do they want to change the subject and claim that I said nobody died there?
[00:25:05.681 --> 00:25:07.162]  I never said that, that's a lie!
[00:25:07.722 --> 00:25:08.222]  And they know it.
[00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:12.544]  They want to change the subject to how they create these mass murder zones.
[00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:16.502]  But you listen to the fried brain.
[00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:22.105]  You listen to the gibbering evil of someone's brain, whacked out.
[00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:26.368]  You know, they say 75% of foster kids are on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:38.815]  And you listen to this whacked out brain, this demon, this demon-possessed golem creature, the product of the liberals and their program of appeasement and of their promised program where the government stand down,
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.826]  At every level, at the place they advertise for killers to go, and he says, I'm going to be somebody.
[00:25:45.886 --> 00:25:46.567]  I'm going to go in.
[00:25:46.627 --> 00:25:47.387]  This is my day.
[00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:47.888]  Get ready.
[00:25:48.188 --> 00:25:51.692]  Gleefully knowing that nobody's going to be there to stop him.
[00:25:52.032 --> 00:25:56.677]  Gleefully knowing that they've had drills so he can observe how to do it and how to take action.
[00:25:58.258 --> 00:26:00.360]  And this is his demonic attack on us.
[00:26:01.428 --> 00:26:09.551]  And then the real demons, the Democratic Party and the media, they then use this to project it on good Americans and tell us we're to blame for their Frankenstein.
[00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:12.432]  Nicholas Cruz, here is the sickening truth.
[00:26:13.412 --> 00:26:13.773]  Hello.
[00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:18.154]  My name is Nick, and I'm gonna be the next school shooter of 2018.
[00:26:18.554 --> 00:26:25.357]  My goal is at least 20 people with an AR-15 and a couple tracer rounds.
[00:26:25.597 --> 00:26:27.158]  I think I can do a good time.
[00:26:28.218 --> 00:26:30.299]  Location is Stone Douglas.
[00:26:32.122 --> 00:26:33.303]  In Parkland, Florida.
[00:26:33.323 --> 00:26:36.525]  It's gonna be a big... Stop right there.
[00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:41.828]  Notice they always use the AR-15 in 99% of these because they're told.
[00:26:42.228 --> 00:26:43.508]  You use the AR-15.
[00:26:43.548 --> 00:26:44.289]  You go to the school.
[00:26:44.489 --> 00:26:45.390]  The media hypes it.
[00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.130]  They prepare it.
[00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.271]  This is how you do it.
[00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:48.071]  They know what they're doing.
[00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:48.631]  Let's continue.
[00:26:51.253 --> 00:26:54.655]  And when you see me on the news, you'll all know who I am.
[00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:58.037]  You're all going to die.
[00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:02.619]  Hit pause again.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:09.465]  He was allowed to do this for four or five years when he should have had his brains beaten out.
[00:27:09.945 --> 00:27:10.326]  Continue.
[00:27:11.345 --> 00:27:11.645]  Can't wait.
[00:27:12.825 --> 00:27:13.206]  Can't wait.
[00:27:14.726 --> 00:27:16.507]  All right, here's the plan.
[00:27:16.547 --> 00:27:20.308]  I'm gonna go take an Uber in the afternoon before 2.40.
[00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:25.189]  From there, I'll go into the... By the way, this is what people under mind control sound like.
[00:27:25.209 --> 00:27:25.850]  They're all fractured.
[00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:26.610]  They don't know who they are.
[00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:31.311]  And he was controlled by the culture, by the drugs, by the enabling, by the media hyping it.
[00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:32.112]  That's mind control.
[00:27:32.592 --> 00:27:33.632]  All that was mind control.
[00:27:33.992 --> 00:27:35.753]  On him, clearly a drugged-up autistic.
[00:27:35.773 --> 00:27:36.013]  Continue.
[00:27:36.033 --> 00:27:38.614]  I'll wait, and people will die.
[00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:41.781]  Today is the day.
[00:27:41.801 --> 00:27:44.123]  The day that it all begins.
[00:27:44.923 --> 00:27:46.885]  The day of my massacre shall begin.
[00:27:48.566 --> 00:27:51.707]  All the kids in school will run in fear and hide.
[00:27:52.728 --> 00:27:55.250]  From the wrath of my power, they will know who I am.
[00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.411]  I am nothing.
[00:27:57.431 --> 00:27:58.452]  I am no one.
[00:27:59.232 --> 00:28:00.853]  My life is nothing and meaningless.
[00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:05.016]  Everything that I hold dear, I let go beyond your half.
[00:28:06.717 --> 00:28:08.878]  Every day, I see the world ending another day.
[00:28:11.328 --> 00:28:14.470]  I live a lone life, living in seclusion and solitude.
[00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.911]  I hate everyone and everything.
[00:28:18.111 --> 00:28:20.833]  With the power of my AR, you will all know who I am.
[00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:22.873]  This is a liberal creature.
[00:28:22.893 --> 00:28:25.695]  I've had enough of being told what to do and when to do.
[00:28:26.655 --> 00:28:27.876]  Pause again.
[00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:33.919]  Let's come back with that Bill Maher piece where he says he wants to kill everybody, he wants the highways open, the left says they hate everybody, he wants to kill everybody.
[00:28:34.219 --> 00:28:35.059]  This is their guy!
[00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:37.120]  Let's go out to break with him.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.500]  Here it is.
[00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:40.702]  Telling me that I'm an idiot and a dumbass.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.662]  In real life, you're all the dumbasses.
[00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:48.347]  You're all stupid and brainwashed by the political government.
[00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:51.570]  Oh, for being in the gun-free zone?
[00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.591]  You will all see.
[00:28:53.092 --> 00:28:54.593]  You will all know who my name is.
[00:28:56.715 --> 00:28:59.298]  My love for you, Angie, will never go away.
[00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:02.001]  This is what we have the Second Amendment for, is this monster.
[00:29:09.463 --> 00:29:12.385]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:13.546]  I wanna rock!
[00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:21.852]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[00:29:21.892 --> 00:29:28.517]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:29:29.178 --> 00:29:30.378]  Stop.
[00:29:30.418 --> 00:29:30.619]  Stop.
[00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:38.467]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[00:29:39.708 --> 00:29:41.909]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[00:29:42.089 --> 00:29:43.690]  I could end this guy, Jack, tomorrow.
[00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.191]  All you gotta do is arm all your best.
[00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:54.835]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[00:29:54.975 --> 00:29:55.676]  Where's the beat?
[00:29:55.996 --> 00:29:57.957]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.892]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[00:30:02.052 --> 00:30:10.458]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[00:30:10.478 --> 00:30:21.626]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and in time, bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots.
[00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:39.725]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:46.589]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[00:30:46.929 --> 00:30:48.050]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:52.936]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[00:30:53.056 --> 00:30:57.681]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[00:30:58.932 --> 00:31:03.275]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:07.718]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[00:31:07.738 --> 00:31:10.580]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:18.145]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[00:31:18.445 --> 00:31:22.768]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[00:31:23.068 --> 00:31:28.392]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[00:31:29.473 --> 00:31:30.654]  I'm scared of these people.
[00:31:31.334 --> 00:31:33.656]  I'm very scared of them.
[00:31:33.856 --> 00:31:40.762]  How do you think the crack rock gets into the country?
[00:31:40.782 --> 00:31:42.183]  We don't own any planes.
[00:31:42.643 --> 00:31:43.744]  We don't own no ships.
[00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:47.347]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[00:31:47.587 --> 00:31:54.273]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:03.804]  Men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine in Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:08.807]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[00:32:08.847 --> 00:32:15.932]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[00:32:16.372 --> 00:32:23.176]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-controvers
[00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:28.938]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:35.641]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[00:32:36.221 --> 00:32:41.243]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[00:32:41.443 --> 00:32:44.625]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[00:32:45.145 --> 00:32:47.866]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[00:32:48.506 --> 00:32:52.769]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[00:32:52.829 --> 00:32:53.750]  Lewinsky.
[00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.591]  These allegations are false.
[00:32:56.892 --> 00:33:02.516]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[00:33:05.898 --> 00:33:08.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.193]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:29.253 --> 00:33:31.735]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:50.336 --> 00:33:53.483]  Broadcasting worldwide, Owens Dreuer is here in studio with us.
[00:33:53.523 --> 00:33:55.346]  He hosts the War Room every day, 3 p.m.
[00:33:55.406 --> 00:33:55.767]  Central.
[00:33:55.787 --> 00:33:58.793]  We're going to be going to him with some big announcements here in a moment.
[00:33:58.853 --> 00:33:59.835]  Then the head of UKIP.
[00:34:01.601 --> 00:34:05.262]  Gerard Batchin breaks down the latest on Tommy Robinson.
[00:34:05.282 --> 00:34:09.863]  We're going to have that exclusively for you from the UK coming up in the next segment.
[00:34:09.883 --> 00:34:19.906]  We're going to be following Trump obviously as well live from Houston where he meets with the families and some of the survivors and victims of the terrible events at Santa Fe.
[00:34:20.686 --> 00:34:22.828]  Mass shooting that did happen.
[00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:24.369]  Parkland did happen.
[00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.791]  I never said they didn't happen.
[00:34:26.111 --> 00:34:28.093]  The media is now saying I said that didn't happen.
[00:34:28.473 --> 00:34:32.197]  They have gone to a next level of deception, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:32.677 --> 00:34:34.819]  But people now know the media lies like this show.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.582]  It's actually our listeners are being more supportive.
[00:34:38.683 --> 00:34:41.465]  People on the streets, it's like when they say Trump says he hates all Mexicans.
[00:34:41.505 --> 00:34:43.187]  No, he said we got a lot of criminals coming across.
[00:34:44.278 --> 00:34:44.978]  From all over the world.
[00:34:45.678 --> 00:34:48.419]  Or when he said, sir, what about MS-13 killing everybody?
[00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:49.400]  He goes, yes, they're animals.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.340]  They're literal devil worshippers.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.261]  They do devil worship rituals.
[00:34:54.521 --> 00:34:57.402]  So it's, animals don't do stuff just to be mean most of the time.
[00:34:57.682 --> 00:35:01.263]  I'd say he's, MS-13 is worse than animals.
[00:35:01.283 --> 00:35:02.004]  Trump is wrong.
[00:35:02.364 --> 00:35:11.607]  So Owen's got a big announcement here that ties into the mass shootings and saving people's lives and the fact that there are going to be a bunch of executions taking place.
[00:35:13.306 --> 00:35:15.127]  At below preschool level.
[00:35:15.147 --> 00:35:19.330]  There are going to be thousands of children executed today and tomorrow.
[00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.351]  We're going to tell you about that here in just a moment.
[00:35:21.371 --> 00:35:23.192]  But the media doesn't humanize them.
[00:35:23.652 --> 00:35:27.515]  They don't, like they now, Planned Parenthood, says that a heartbeat is not life.
[00:35:28.255 --> 00:35:30.297]  So we're going to be looking at all that here in a moment.
[00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:38.782]  But first, if you want to help us go through the storm and take everybody else with us through the storm, because we are the main enemy of the globalists,
[00:35:40.452 --> 00:35:55.048]  There's an official article in Reuters today saying that they need a Peter Thiel to back the, quote, destruction of Infowars, and they actually lie about me with malice aforethought with intent to do harm, misrepresent what I've said and done, to then destroy me.
[00:35:55.088 --> 00:36:00.153]  So this is the very definition of true malice aforethought, intent to do harm, by Reuters!
[00:36:01.054 --> 00:36:02.396]  That has their editorial board.
[00:36:03.821 --> 00:36:06.724]  Coming out and then totally notice no video links.
[00:36:06.804 --> 00:36:07.345]  No clips.
[00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:28.244]  No actual quotes of me Nothing, but pure deception saying I'm currently ever was bullying Sandy Hook parents currently sending people to harass them never did that Currently saying nobody died, but all I did was look at both sides of it which people have a right to do It's an American's blood to question Gulf of Tonkin JFK any other stuff, but now the media goes further and says that I say
[00:36:29.205 --> 00:36:34.568]  Each new thing never happened, and everybody's crisis actors, and it's a lie, it's a fraud, and it's going to come out.
[00:36:34.648 --> 00:36:37.350]  But that said, why are they after us?
[00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.131]  Because they understand we've got their numbers.
[00:36:39.171 --> 00:36:43.313]  So if you want to stand against the globalists, we don't have a George Soros.
[00:36:46.055 --> 00:36:48.396]  You are our George Soros, the American people and people of the world.
[00:36:48.416 --> 00:36:55.500]  So I want to thank you all, many of you, and we want to open offices in Australia and other places so that we can have distributors in those countries so you get things at a lower price.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.581]  We have a lot of orders from Australia.
[00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:57.822]  I know the shipping's incredible.
[00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:59.450]  A lot of orders in Europe.
[00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.151]  We're working on all that.
[00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:02.392]  That's why the globalists are after us.
[00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:07.076]  Because they know that we're involved in expansion in their face.
[00:37:07.096 --> 00:37:08.076]  But they're trying to stop that.
[00:37:08.096 --> 00:37:11.199]  So, take advantage of Memorial Day specials that extend through this week.

[00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:47.587]  Again, that is how deceptive these people are.

[00:38:33.858 --> 00:38:34.799]  But here's the deal.
[00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:41.765]  They're targeting us, so I'm proud of that.
[00:38:41.885 --> 00:38:42.906]  I know we're over the target.
[00:38:42.966 --> 00:38:43.886]  I know we're changing the world.

[00:38:57.154 --> 00:38:59.576]  There's a lot of different treatments, thousands of them that have been suppressed.
[00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:05.578]  But also now that this will then allow the acceleration of discovering what works best for everybody else.
[00:39:06.098 --> 00:39:08.118]  So these people are really hitting the barbed wire for us.
[00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:12.380]  And of course, overwhelmingly, people that are terminally ill want experimental treatments.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.060]  They can't get here.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.680]  They got to go to Germany or other places.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.861]  Switzerland.
[00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:17.241]  So this is nothing but a win-win.
[00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:20.022]  In fact, the left slope set shows they're pro-death.
[00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:22.763]  I gotta say, I got mad at Trump about Syria.
[00:39:22.803 --> 00:39:24.223]  He's not perfect, but he knows what he's doing.
[00:39:24.524 --> 00:39:37.069]  On North Korea, on the economy, on 4% growth rates about to be announced, on these great pardons of Anesh D'Souza, Martha Stewart he's talking about, with the jobs coming back, how much the globalists hate him, how he's getting good Supreme Court judges and good judges in.
[00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:40.030]  This is a death reprieve for America.
[00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:44.032]  And you can see it and feel it, and you can see Trump's beginning to turn the corner.
[00:39:44.392 --> 00:39:45.332]  He's beginning to win.
[00:39:45.892 --> 00:39:47.153]  His beachhead is expanding.
[00:39:47.213 --> 00:39:48.433]  The swamp is beginning to drain.
[00:39:48.914 --> 00:39:49.414]  And this is
[00:39:50.752 --> 00:39:54.895]  Absolutely, because our ancestors were Christian, many of them, and because they prayed for providence.
[00:39:55.156 --> 00:39:56.417]  And we're living off their providence.
[00:39:56.437 --> 00:39:57.738]  So I want to thank my ancestors.
[00:39:58.178 --> 00:39:59.459]  I want to thank all of you, the listeners.
[00:39:59.859 --> 00:40:01.621]  And I am just bullied by this.
[00:40:01.821 --> 00:40:03.962]  And we are going over the top.
[00:40:04.002 --> 00:40:05.163]  It means there's big fights to come.
[00:40:06.994 --> 00:40:10.756]  I'm getting good chills right now, not the sickening chills I had playing that horrible clip.
[00:40:11.516 --> 00:40:12.597]  So Owen Schroer's here.
[00:40:12.617 --> 00:40:19.260]  We're going to get into the big demonstration and what he's launching tomorrow that I hope you'll be part of here in Austin to illustrate things.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:28.925]  But you saw that sickening Nick Cruz video shot on his cell phone, retrieved by police, about how he was in love killing everybody in the total darkness and the evil.
[00:40:29.545 --> 00:40:31.747]  Clearly, he's been on Prozac-type drugs his whole life.
[00:40:31.787 --> 00:40:34.450]  He's been under their control and programmed by the computers.
[00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:38.254]  Constant interruptions from smartphones can impact brain chemistry, scientists say.
[00:40:38.534 --> 00:40:39.495]  That's CBS News.
[00:40:39.955 --> 00:40:41.777]  It is disassociating us.
[00:40:42.098 --> 00:40:45.040]  Well, the average person becomes a disassociated sociopath.
[00:40:45.081 --> 00:40:45.921]  They're not psychotic.
[00:40:46.242 --> 00:40:53.349]  But you take somebody like this and put them into a culture of bullying, shoot them up video games, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it's always the same formula.
[00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:56.533]  Well, and I couldn't believe that video.
[00:40:56.773 --> 00:41:07.858]  And you take a look at what we know from leaked government documents when it comes to the effect of cell phones and the radio waves on your mind, how they can even control and manipulate your mind and even your physical activity.
[00:41:08.178 --> 00:41:16.782]  You combine that with the Vault 7 leaks from WikiLeaks to talk about how the CIA has access to pretty much anything in the digital world, including your cell phone.
[00:41:17.163 --> 00:41:21.845]  Then you add in the element that the FBI, local law enforcement was aware of
[00:41:22.265 --> 00:41:27.968]  Nicholas Cruz multiple times up to I think overall when it's all aggregated it's like 60 times or something.
[00:41:28.429 --> 00:41:33.532]  So I would imagine that that video had to be known to someone.
[00:41:33.832 --> 00:41:36.894]  I would be shocked if that video was not known to somebody.
[00:41:37.374 --> 00:41:41.997]  And if not, you just wonder why they're not looking into that when they knew this kid was a threat.
[00:41:42.277 --> 00:41:44.518]  He made social media posts before about this.
[00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:46.179]  He was known as a school shooter.
[00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:47.160]  He had FBI called.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.861]  So it's amazing to think
[00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:52.324]  That he was able to record that video, have it sitting on his phone.
[00:41:52.404 --> 00:41:53.705]  Who knows how long it was on his phone.
[00:41:53.725 --> 00:41:54.906]  He had a cast on in that video.
[00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.067]  He didn't the day he was arrested.
[00:41:56.087 --> 00:41:56.847]  I don't know anything about that.
[00:41:56.867 --> 00:42:00.450]  I think what you're saying is, it's declassified that they created mass shooters.
[00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:01.831]  Mainly assassins.
[00:42:01.871 --> 00:42:02.912]  That's declassified.
[00:42:02.952 --> 00:42:03.773]  Not mass shooters.
[00:42:04.013 --> 00:42:04.614]  But assassins.
[00:42:05.454 --> 00:42:13.296]  It's well known that the tower shooter had connections to that, and that was kind of the first of this whole mass shooting phenomenon here in Austin in the early 60s.
[00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:25.420]  But what you're getting at is we could reasonably say he could be a mind control victim when you add the police stand down, the Democrats in control of the area, the fact that he was allowed to commit all these crimes for four plus years in the Promise Program.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:30.925]  It's all there, but I say it's cultural mind control, and that that was all allowed to happen.
[00:42:30.985 --> 00:42:40.294]  The TV, the shoot-em-up games, the stand-down, him saying he's a mass shooter, the media hyping mass shootings, all of that is the cultural mind control that produces this.
[00:42:40.394 --> 00:42:41.736]  One way or another, it is mind control.
[00:42:42.136 --> 00:42:43.037]  But here's what it wasn't.
[00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:47.502]  It wasn't the NRA's fault, it wasn't the gun's fault, and it wasn't the Second Amendment's fault.
[00:42:47.863 --> 00:42:49.625]  And we're going to tie all this together on the other side.
[00:42:49.665 --> 00:42:50.646]  But that's the key.
[00:42:50.926 --> 00:42:53.209]  That's who they blame, but that's not at fault.
[00:42:53.249 --> 00:42:55.031]  There are dozens of other things we need to look at.
[00:42:55.331 --> 00:43:00.036]  It's a total climate, a total system, where this new phenomenon started in 99 of the mass school shootings.
[00:43:00.237 --> 00:43:02.679]  The media hyping it is the critical catalyst.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:09.589]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.373]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore.
[00:43:12.774 --> 00:43:16.599]  The patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.043]  And the world is taking notice.
[00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:33.795]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.
[00:43:34.015 --> 00:43:43.163]  Help support the information war, get great products at the same time, and continue to fund an operation that is a thorn in the side of the globalists and is continuing to back President Trump
[00:43:43.743 --> 00:43:44.863]  How come Hollywood embraces
[00:44:08.698 --> 00:44:12.081]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[00:44:12.701 --> 00:44:15.183]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old, it was statutory rape.
[00:44:15.263 --> 00:44:16.044]  Yeah, alright.
[00:44:16.104 --> 00:44:18.646]  Well, it's not statutory rape.
[00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:21.108]  He had sex with a minor, alright?
[00:44:21.148 --> 00:44:22.689]  That's not rape, you know?
[00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:24.831]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:26.352]  That she didn't want to have.
[00:44:26.452 --> 00:44:27.932]  No, that was not the case at all.
[00:44:27.992 --> 00:44:29.053]  She wanted to have it.
[00:44:29.153 --> 00:44:32.334]  Well, in the transcripts... Dated the guy.
[00:44:32.674 --> 00:44:33.534]  Dated the guy.
[00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:34.695]  She was 13!
[00:44:35.395 --> 00:44:36.095]  And found out.
[00:44:36.175 --> 00:44:38.736]  Well, by the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[00:44:38.756 --> 00:44:41.037]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything.
[00:44:41.057 --> 00:44:42.118]  Alright?
[00:44:42.218 --> 00:44:43.318]  Wait a second.
[00:44:43.358 --> 00:44:46.899]  You have sex with a 13-year-old girl and you're a grown man.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.081]  You know that that's wrong because she has a... You're giving her booze and pills.
[00:44:52.202 --> 00:44:53.302]  I'm not... Look.
[00:44:54.162 --> 00:44:56.743]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[00:44:56.823 --> 00:44:59.144]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[00:45:16.135 --> 00:45:20.019]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[00:45:20.379 --> 00:45:30.429]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:36.916]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position
[00:45:40.876 --> 00:45:49.643]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[00:45:50.003 --> 00:46:06.296]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they can get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[00:46:06.936 --> 00:46:16.463]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career, ever since he became well-known.
[00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:19.385]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[00:46:19.425 --> 00:46:23.928]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[00:46:23.968 --> 00:46:25.369]  That's what I do for a living.
[00:46:25.409 --> 00:46:30.852]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[00:46:31.753 --> 00:46:34.375]  It's just what you do for a living.
[00:46:35.561 --> 00:46:36.741]  You have a job.
[00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:40.322]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[00:46:40.622 --> 00:46:48.724]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[00:46:48.744 --> 00:46:53.245]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[00:46:54.385 --> 00:46:55.725]  They have a real problem.
[00:46:55.805 --> 00:46:57.446]  They need to come back down to earth.
[00:46:57.546 --> 00:46:58.946]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[00:47:06.954 --> 00:47:09.696]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.544 --> 00:47:26.745]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:32.368]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:38.484]  You know, the authoritarian corporate back left worldwide, from Communist China to here in the U.S.
[00:47:39.798 --> 00:47:47.944]  And their command bases, the universities, the abortuaries, they're masters of defining things and telling you, you must follow their playbook and their definition.
[00:47:48.445 --> 00:47:50.526]  Oh, the word mankind is hurtful.
[00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:52.588]  Let's take it out of the National Anthem of Canada.
[00:47:52.868 --> 00:47:56.711]  Oh, the words mother and father are hurtful on elementary school entry forms.
[00:47:56.731 --> 00:47:57.512]  We're not going to have that.
[00:47:57.532 --> 00:48:01.175]  We're going to have G and Z. If you don't use that, it's jail time in California.
[00:48:01.715 --> 00:48:02.336]  This is here.
[00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:07.099]  And now they come out and define, oh, life isn't a heart beating.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.701]  That's just a blob of tissue.
[00:48:09.665 --> 00:48:13.442]  And of course, Planned Parenthood came out just two weeks ago and said, yes, that's not even a human in there.
[00:48:14.221 --> 00:48:15.642]  As if they control reality.
[00:48:15.682 --> 00:48:18.963]  Well, we are defining reality according to common sense.
[00:48:19.183 --> 00:48:20.844]  And those are babies, those are children.
[00:48:21.244 --> 00:48:37.971]  And there are going to be hundreds of little boys and little girls killed in Austin, Texas, execution style, hit with acid, hit with chemicals as they fight for their lives, attacked with scalpels, sucked out by high-powered vacuum cleaners.
[00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:43.174]  And then their bodies are going to be rendered up and sold into the medical and cosmetics market.
[00:48:43.894 --> 00:48:51.795]  So we talk about, oh, treat animals with compassion, but don't treat humans with compassion because they're not humans.
[00:48:51.835 --> 00:48:56.856]  And now the bioethics boards are saying, we're not going to take care of the veterans and we're going to euthanize old people.
[00:48:56.936 --> 00:48:57.657]  It's so liberal.
[00:48:57.697 --> 00:49:03.418]  And don't let Trump, you know, he signed the bill where people that are terminal can take a drug that might save them.
[00:49:03.718 --> 00:49:04.218]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:49:04.278 --> 00:49:07.438]  You can have assisted suicide, but you can't live.
[00:49:08.018 --> 00:49:10.319]  I mean, this is truly a death cult, my friend.
[00:49:11.186 --> 00:49:15.590]  Well, and probably thousands of babies nationwide are going to be slaughtered.
[00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:20.055]  Innocent children denied the right to life tomorrow in America.
[00:49:20.155 --> 00:49:35.329]  So, Alex, I reached a point where I got so fed up of hearing about the NRA, Republicans, Second Amendment, me, you, InfoWars, being blamed for any time there's a shooting.
[00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:46.736]  So much to the extent that I can't even show up with an InfoWars mic flag to cover the Santa Fe shooting without getting harassed by someone insinuating that it's our fault people are dying.
[00:49:47.297 --> 00:49:53.800]  So, yeah, they're the ones engaging in the bullying of us and so we're allowed to speculate if these are real or not or do they stand down.
[00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:55.982]  Sometimes, you know, they stand down as we've proven.
[00:49:57.506 --> 00:49:58.006]  But exactly.
[00:49:58.046 --> 00:50:00.348]  They're the ones projecting this on us when they're the party of death.
[00:50:00.768 --> 00:50:02.609]  And that's not even what I was in Santa Fe doing.
[00:50:02.629 --> 00:50:06.912]  We were just there talking to the students at the school trying to get a story about what was going on.
[00:50:07.192 --> 00:50:08.653]  It's a live event happening.
[00:50:08.693 --> 00:50:09.954]  Why wouldn't InfoWars be there?
[00:50:09.974 --> 00:50:13.056]  Because the left wants to define who can go out and be news.
[00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.357]  They want their control freaks.
[00:50:14.377 --> 00:50:15.958]  Well, and that's the key.
[00:50:16.398 --> 00:50:25.764]  But I reached the point where I was so sick of seeing the NRA get blamed for this and gun owners get blamed for this that I decided that I'm going to launch a protest here in Austin
[00:50:26.284 --> 00:50:35.406]  At Planned Parenthood tomorrow at 1130, right there, we'll be live streaming on the Alex Jones Channel on Facebook, the Alex Jones Channel as well.
[00:50:35.426 --> 00:50:36.387]  We may pipe in with you.
[00:50:36.407 --> 00:50:37.827]  Oh, you're going to be live with me tomorrow?
[00:50:38.047 --> 00:50:39.267]  And so we're going to be standing out there.
[00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:40.868]  Starts at 1030 Central here in Austin, Texas.
[00:50:41.168 --> 00:50:46.669]  And we're going to be... How dare you in a blue, blue cyst, you know, on the red state, how dare you show up?
[00:50:46.969 --> 00:50:54.011]  I mean, I'm sure the antifa, like the last time I protested with Jakari Jackson at the abortuary, they showed up and tried to block us out from having our speech.
[00:50:54.531 --> 00:51:02.353]  Yeah, I mean, if you've got people that want to show up in support of aborting babies, then that's their right to prove that they are in a death cult.
[00:51:02.433 --> 00:51:02.953]  That's fine.
[00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:04.894]  We'll be perfectly okay with that.
[00:51:04.934 --> 00:51:06.534]  So tell people where you're going to be and what's going to happen.
[00:51:06.654 --> 00:51:09.615]  The Planned Parenthood on Ben White in Austin, Texas.
[00:51:09.675 --> 00:51:10.475]  I'm going to be there.
[00:51:10.555 --> 00:51:13.316]  We'll be there by 11 o'clock live with Alex Jones.
[00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:14.996]  We'll be showing up about 10.30, setting up.
[00:51:15.556 --> 00:51:18.897]  And what we're going to do is, we're going to just have some facts.
[00:51:19.137 --> 00:51:20.458]  I won't give away the full
[00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:25.221]  And there's plenty of parking all around there in neighborhoods and businesses.
[00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:31.225]  Yeah, or you can, you know, get dropped off or whatever you need to do if the parking's not bad or you can get parking a little bit farther away.
[00:51:31.245 --> 00:51:34.388]  It's an access road of 290, right off 35th Street, so there's usually not a lot of traffic.
[00:51:34.408 --> 00:51:35.449]  You can just pull right up and get out.
[00:51:35.609 --> 00:51:43.035]  And, you know, if you are afraid of, you know, some violent protesters showing up and damaging your vehicle, then maybe park a little bit farther away and you can get dropped off because we know that that
[00:51:43.655 --> 00:51:44.496]  Goes on as well.
[00:51:44.516 --> 00:51:49.580]  Oh, and by the way, when they show up, they will say, we love Satan, we kill our babies, and they've got Satan tattoos all over them.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.081]  You're going to actually face the enemy.
[00:51:51.482 --> 00:51:59.048]  Well... And then they'll suddenly go... They'll actually, they're not acting, they're like, it's like, we are slaves, we are dying.
[00:51:59.068 --> 00:51:59.529]  They can hardly walk.
[00:51:59.569 --> 00:52:00.149]  I love abortion.
[00:52:00.169 --> 00:52:00.850]  They fall down.
[00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:01.931]  I want to kill kids.
[00:52:02.191 --> 00:52:03.872]  I mean, it's just like Nick Cruz stuff.
[00:52:03.892 --> 00:52:05.634]  It's like, it's hopeless.
[00:52:06.735 --> 00:52:07.395]  I love killing them.
[00:52:08.036 --> 00:52:08.716]  Satan!
[00:52:08.897 --> 00:52:09.917]  And you're like, it means...
[00:52:10.678 --> 00:52:12.619]  So we're going to have some numbers out there.
[00:52:12.639 --> 00:52:13.660]  You want to face Linda Blair?
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.342]  Because they're drawn like Mazda Flame to the killing happening inside.
[00:52:17.662 --> 00:52:20.364]  You will actually see real Satanists tomorrow.
[00:52:21.084 --> 00:52:26.867]  You know, and it makes me think of Margaret Sanger because... Hitler's favorite person?
[00:52:26.927 --> 00:52:27.928]  This is actually incredible.
[00:52:28.925 --> 00:52:35.952]  There is a record shop here in Austin, and they do like trendy pins, you know, like little pins.
[00:52:36.613 --> 00:52:44.340]  And one of the trendy pins they have is a Margaret Sanger birth control thing, and it's like, cultural icon, Margaret Sanger.
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.822]  And it's like... Cover the Newsweek, cover the Time.
[00:52:46.983 --> 00:52:48.144]  Heil Hitler!
[00:52:48.424 --> 00:52:49.225]  Heil Hitler!
[00:52:49.565 --> 00:52:51.386]  There she is with the KKK in a real photo.
[00:52:51.446 --> 00:52:52.487]  So, Heil Hitler!
[00:52:52.707 --> 00:52:53.427]  Heil Hitler!
[00:52:54.048 --> 00:52:55.869]  So this is the kind of stuff... But it's liberal!
[00:52:56.009 --> 00:52:56.329]  Heil Hitler!
[00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:56.970]  Heil Hitler, she says!
[00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:01.853]  This is the kind of stuff we're going to bring to the table tomorrow right in front of Planned Parenthood here in Austin, Texas on Benoit.
[00:53:01.873 --> 00:53:03.474]  Oh, you're going to have mass printouts of that.
[00:53:03.594 --> 00:53:04.874]  Yeah, we'll have mass printouts of this.
[00:53:04.914 --> 00:53:06.576]  We'll have Margaret Sanger quotes.
[00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:07.976]  I've got some other factoids.
[00:53:08.036 --> 00:53:09.497]  You've done well, Rosita.
[00:53:09.677 --> 00:53:12.079]  So it's going to be... They're going to have to face the facts.
[00:53:12.759 --> 00:53:16.321]  And they can sit here and point the finger at everybody else to blame for death.
[00:53:16.342 --> 00:53:16.902]  There's a quote!
[00:53:17.731 --> 00:53:20.033]  We want to exterminate the Negro population.
[00:53:20.073 --> 00:53:22.695]  That is a direct Margaret Sanger quote.
[00:53:23.115 --> 00:53:24.436]  This is the hero of the left though.
[00:53:24.917 --> 00:53:26.057]  I mean, see this is what I'm saying.
[00:53:26.097 --> 00:53:27.599]  You can pull up Margaret Sanger quotes.
[00:53:27.619 --> 00:53:31.802]  The most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[00:53:33.564 --> 00:53:35.646]  And by the way, she dated one of the Rockefellers.
[00:53:36.186 --> 00:53:37.527]  She was in the big sex orgies.
[00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.629]  She was in the Blavatsky devil worship.
[00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:40.650]  There they are, right there.
[00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:42.712]  You just saw some of the devil worshippers, right there.
[00:53:43.392 --> 00:53:43.973]  The death cult.
[00:53:44.353 --> 00:53:44.553]  Yeah.
[00:53:44.993 --> 00:53:46.455]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:53:46.475 --> 00:53:49.958]  Yeah, this lady's not a devil worshipper, but the one before said, we love Satan, we kill our kids.
[00:53:50.658 --> 00:53:52.239]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:53:52.279 --> 00:54:01.663]  Now, and this is, you have to juxtapose this, because now these are the same people that want to blame Trump for everything, say Trump is racist, say Trump is that, this, that, everything.
[00:54:01.883 --> 00:54:11.927]  Well, we can put a mirror up to them and say, you worship Margaret Sanger, you worship Planned Parenthood, look at what she said, look at what she did, and let's see how they respond to that.
[00:54:12.407 --> 00:54:14.409]  And, unfortunately, you kind of already broke it down.
[00:54:14.449 --> 00:54:18.132]  They start cackling and breaking down into some goblin state.
[00:54:18.232 --> 00:54:21.235]  If they do a remake of Wizard of Oz, they could be... I'll get you, my pretty!
[00:54:21.455 --> 00:54:22.776]  And your little dog as well!
[00:54:23.717 --> 00:54:26.119]  If I'll be very delicately done, though, don't you worry!
[00:54:26.299 --> 00:54:28.321]  The fluoride will slowly rot your brain!
[00:54:28.661 --> 00:54:37.066]  The cell phones will fry your mind and give you no cognition or any type of basic memory until we fully have you, my pretties.
[00:54:37.346 --> 00:54:40.408]  And then your soul will be slowly sucked out of you.
[00:54:40.888 --> 00:54:44.751]  But it would be a lot easier if we could just kill you before you were born.
[00:54:44.771 --> 00:54:46.652]  So why don't you just die?
[00:54:46.672 --> 00:54:49.153]  It'd be much better if you just died!
[00:54:49.393 --> 00:54:52.135]  Cause your mother's in hell, and you know what she's doing!
[00:54:52.595 --> 00:54:58.342]  I want to reincarnate Margaret Sanger and put her head in a jar and make her the president.
[00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.304]  She should be the president of Facebook.
[00:55:01.305 --> 00:55:02.867]  Take that newspaper printout.
[00:55:02.907 --> 00:55:03.507]  Go to Kinko's.
[00:55:03.547 --> 00:55:04.789]  I know you're already on it.
[00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:05.670]  Print hundreds of those.
[00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.314]  And we ought to just go around on liberals' cars at the mall.
[00:55:09.354 --> 00:55:10.235]  You see Hillary stickers?
[00:55:10.615 --> 00:55:12.337]  And just keep those and just put them on.
[00:55:12.357 --> 00:55:13.418]  I'm like, son of Hitler!
[00:55:14.159 --> 00:55:16.561]  You know, it's actually funny because they still... The media would spin it though.
[00:55:16.881 --> 00:55:19.263]  Alex Jones puts out Nazi paraphernalia.
[00:55:19.303 --> 00:55:19.623]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:19.863]  No!
[00:55:20.024 --> 00:55:20.924]  You're the Nazis!
[00:55:21.425 --> 00:55:21.765]  All of you!
[00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:22.645]  It's where you came from!
[00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:23.346]  It's who you are!
[00:55:23.406 --> 00:55:24.607]  We're onto you!
[00:55:25.007 --> 00:55:29.090]  But look at the results of their political policies.
[00:55:29.691 --> 00:55:36.336]  They don't want the right to try life extension, possibly technologies, breakthrough technologies, new drugs... I told you Trump was going to do that!
[00:55:37.096 --> 00:55:39.037]  They don't want children to be born.
[00:55:39.817 --> 00:55:40.997]  But this is the death cult though.
[00:55:41.017 --> 00:55:46.559]  I mean, this is incredible whether wittingly or unwittingly, Trump is forcing them to show who they really are.
[00:55:47.179 --> 00:55:48.719]  He comes out and says MS-13 are animals.
[00:55:48.739 --> 00:55:50.540]  We're like, no, they're babies, they're sweethearts.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:58.162]  They are devil worshippers that grab little girls and torture them to death in what they call a black right to get power.
[00:55:58.542 --> 00:56:06.825]  They torture little girls to death and mutilate them for days with knives and burn them, sucking their energy out.
[00:56:07.065 --> 00:56:09.446]  That's mainstream news!
[00:56:09.486 --> 00:56:14.787]  They torture your little girls to death and Nancy Pighead Pelosi loves it.
[00:56:14.907 --> 00:56:15.728]  But that's a human, Alex.
[00:56:15.748 --> 00:56:16.528]  How dare you say that?
[00:56:16.548 --> 00:56:17.048]  Because that's it.
[00:56:17.128 --> 00:56:21.549]  I'm telling you, Soros and all of the people that know Soros and his house, it's all black walls and black mirrors.
[00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.250]  That's what Satan is to.
[00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:27.011]  If you want to say that about an unborn child, then that's fine, because that doesn't exist.
[00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:27.951]  I don't even believe that.
[00:56:28.031 --> 00:56:30.192]  But don't say that about an MS-13 gang member.
[00:56:30.232 --> 00:56:31.072]  How cold of you!
[00:56:32.072 --> 00:56:32.873]  I mean, how dare you?
[00:56:32.893 --> 00:56:36.334]  Well, you know why really high-level Satanists have black walls and black mirrors all in their house?
[00:56:36.354 --> 00:56:39.494]  Because they think the demons, they get soaked, like the demons are just flying around.
[00:56:39.514 --> 00:56:40.455]  That's what they think.
[00:56:40.815 --> 00:56:41.775]  They're completely insane.
[00:56:42.675 --> 00:56:46.856]  Well, I don't know anybody that would show up to support abortion.
[00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:48.137]  There it is, Washington Post.
[00:56:48.197 --> 00:56:49.717]  You feel the devil's helping you.
[00:56:50.197 --> 00:56:51.658]  MS-13's satanic history.
[00:56:52.574 --> 00:56:55.396]  But that's what I'm saying, it's an energy.
[00:56:55.576 --> 00:56:57.757]  Even if politically... It's a program, it's an energy.
[00:56:57.937 --> 00:57:04.582]  Even if politically you think abortion should be legal or you're pro-choice, who shows up to like support abortion?
[00:57:05.082 --> 00:57:07.924]  Like who shows up like, yes, I want abortion.
[00:57:07.964 --> 00:57:11.106]  And I'm telling you, whether they're white or black, you'll see it tomorrow, green skin.
[00:57:12.126 --> 00:57:14.648]  It's like, seriously, my dad calls it translucent, and they go...
[00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:17.550]  And then one climbed in a dumpster?
[00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:19.510]  Oh, I saw they ripped the cord.
[00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:26.373]  Or how about, you know, they pull the whole routine where you're just standing there and then they come up and try to like bow you and they're like, excuse us!
[00:57:26.913 --> 00:57:27.313]  Pardon us!
[00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:29.294]  You know, I'm just standing here.
[00:57:29.374 --> 00:57:30.555]  What is your problem?
[00:57:30.915 --> 00:57:32.995]  Listen, we got free shipping on a bunch of our best-selling items.
[00:57:33.036 --> 00:57:36.017]  We need funding to go to the next level and fight the devil worshiper pedophiles.
[00:57:36.037 --> 00:57:38.458]  We are going in through and beyond trying to save children tomorrow.
[00:57:38.838 --> 00:57:40.078]  Right out there at that address.
[00:57:40.118 --> 00:57:41.819]  Tell folks quickly again the address.
[00:57:42.279 --> 00:57:47.102]  The Planned Parenthood on East, or I guess it's West Ben White Boulevard in Austin, Texas.
[00:57:47.202 --> 00:57:49.984]  It's the big death camp mothership.
[00:57:50.004 --> 00:58:01.412]  201 East Ben White Boulevard, Building B. I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with ImmuneWall.
[00:58:02.662 --> 00:58:04.464]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[00:58:04.504 --> 00:58:11.632]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[00:58:12.032 --> 00:58:17.859]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[00:58:18.519 --> 00:58:19.840]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:29.990]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love.
[00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:39.498]  Because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[00:58:40.579 --> 00:58:44.706]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[00:58:45.026 --> 00:58:50.314]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[00:58:50.714 --> 00:58:51.756]  As above, so below.
[00:58:52.317 --> 00:58:55.481]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the mass scale.
[00:58:56.022 --> 00:58:57.103]  Most tiny of scales.
[00:58:57.623 --> 00:58:58.744]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:58:59.144 --> 00:59:00.625]  America is building its wall.
[00:59:01.026 --> 00:59:01.506]  Will it work?
[00:59:01.626 --> 00:59:02.166]  We don't know.
[00:59:02.627 --> 00:59:03.207]  Is Trump right?
[00:59:03.908 --> 00:59:06.009]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:12.493]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[00:59:12.874 --> 00:59:18.758]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:59:19.498 --> 00:59:25.801]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:29.803]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[00:59:30.243 --> 00:59:41.548]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $56 to $70 and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[00:59:42.208 --> 00:59:44.591]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:48.475]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at m4slife.com.
[00:59:48.815 --> 00:59:52.539]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[00:59:55.001 --> 01:00:00.908]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.271 --> 01:00:21.534]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.519 --> 01:00:42.862]  Guy that's taking Tommy Robbins to the next level with his research, his information.
[01:00:42.882 --> 01:00:48.606]  He's going to give us the latest updates he's allowed to because of all these gag orders and lawyers and Tommy Robbins and the political prisoner.
[01:00:48.626 --> 01:00:50.447]  But we're trying to keep this in the news, you know.
[01:00:50.467 --> 01:00:52.989]  It was super viral over the weekend, but it's planing out.
[01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:54.270]  Big demonstration coming up on the 9th.
[01:00:54.290 --> 01:01:03.356]  They're going to be out at the Planned Parenthood operation tomorrow, pointing out that they're real Nazi in eugenics history and the KKK and the left.
[01:01:03.396 --> 01:01:04.737]  I mean, it's just the facts here.
[01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:05.877]  I'm really getting tired of
[01:01:06.878 --> 01:01:07.859]  I'm calling us the racist.
[01:01:08.479 --> 01:01:15.762]  So we've got our guest joining us here in about five minutes, but finishing up, because you mentioned, Owen, all this racism, this racism, that.
[01:01:16.182 --> 01:01:23.866]  CNN cultural critic, this is just today, there's so many clips I can't even keep track of it, says all white people that voted for Trump are racist.
[01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:27.607]  Mika Brzezinski says Trump is a stone-cold racist, just with no proof.
[01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:34.666]  MSNBC tries to solve racism with bigoted shots at white people.
[01:01:35.006 --> 01:01:35.807]  This is insane!
[01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:38.849]  So as you said, they're going into total overdrive, Owen.
[01:01:39.451 --> 01:01:41.313]  Well, and I don't even know these clips.
[01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:42.574]  There's a series of clips yesterday.
[01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:44.716]  Don Lemon, two other MSNBC hosts.
[01:01:44.736 --> 01:01:45.957]  So I didn't even realize this.
[01:01:46.237 --> 01:01:48.019]  They must be really hitting this tone hard right now.
[01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:48.919]  That's the talking point.
[01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:49.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.962]  So this is the reason why... Trump just signed a thing that will save millions of people.
[01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.203]  RACIST!
[01:01:53.764 --> 01:01:54.644]  The economy's coming back.
[01:01:54.925 --> 01:01:56.026]  RACIST!
[01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.549]  All the numbers say the Republicans are going to win Congress in the midterms.
[01:01:59.729 --> 01:02:00.650]  RACIST!
[01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:02.551]  Oh my God, the giant blue wave.
[01:02:02.591 --> 01:02:03.432]  Now a red wave.
[01:02:03.472 --> 01:02:04.913]  The historic Trump's dominating.
[01:02:05.174 --> 01:02:05.314]  RACIST!
[01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:06.214]  Racist!
[01:02:06.234 --> 01:02:07.115]  Oh my gosh!
[01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:11.558]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power!
[01:02:11.598 --> 01:02:12.739]  It must be racist!
[01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:15.861]  MS-13 can't torture little girls to death for Satan!
[01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:17.022]  Racist!
[01:02:17.142 --> 01:02:20.985]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes!
[01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:21.425]  Racist!
[01:02:26.526 --> 01:02:28.869]  Real fast, let's play a few of these.
[01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.372]  Let's play Mika Brzezinski.
[01:02:30.392 --> 01:02:36.280]  Here's the daughter of one of the most famous war criminals ever that helped put into fashion things that killed millions of people.
[01:02:36.761 --> 01:02:37.122]  Here it is.
[01:02:37.162 --> 01:02:37.702]  Here's Mika.
[01:02:38.746 --> 01:03:04.247]  It's driven by President Trump, though, this renewed sort of open... I look, and this is anecdotal, but you even, you can use social media also as a lens, and you see in, you know, fast food restaurants and public places, people taking video of racist incidents, and you can see the way people act, and maybe they feel a license to act that way, because this president, I will quote Steve Schmidt, is a stone-cold racist.
[01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:06.369]  He does not... I'm sorry.
[01:03:06.889 --> 01:03:08.911]  I quoted someone else.
[01:03:10.172 --> 01:03:12.134]  Even Psycho Joe was like, whoa, hey.
[01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:17.419]  By the way, I've been in coffee shops and stuff many times, especially when you're younger in college, waiting on somebody.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.461]  In about 10 minutes, they go, hey, you need something?
[01:03:19.481 --> 01:03:20.723]  You want something?
[01:03:20.783 --> 01:03:22.324]  And then a little bit later, I'm like, yeah, I'm waiting on a friend.
[01:03:22.825 --> 01:03:26.208]  They'll come back and say, you need to, it's pretty rude, but they go, you need to order something.
[01:03:26.889 --> 01:03:29.071]  And that's usually if they're real full, but that's their right.
[01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:30.954]  It's your right not to go there.
[01:03:31.215 --> 01:03:36.697]  Well, why would you want to have somebody loitering at your restaurant if you've got paying customers that need a seat?
[01:03:36.757 --> 01:03:38.478]  So that's just capitalism 101.
[01:03:39.178 --> 01:03:41.499]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:03:41.579 --> 01:03:42.720]  I don't even know what she's talking about.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.560]  People going around filming racist stuff.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.081]  What is she... I'm trying to figure that out.
[01:03:47.141 --> 01:03:47.702]  What is she talking about?
[01:03:47.722 --> 01:03:48.742]  Getting kicked out of Starbucks?
[01:03:48.762 --> 01:03:49.162]  Is that it?
[01:03:49.923 --> 01:03:51.243]  Well, and then it gets worse here.
[01:03:51.443 --> 01:03:52.884]  Let's CNN Cultural Critic.
[01:03:53.104 --> 01:03:55.445]  All people that voted for Trump are racist.
[01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:56.946]  Here's that, then we'll go to break and come back with our guest.
[01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:57.246]  Here it is.
[01:03:57.699 --> 01:04:03.321]  I think it's important that we don't make Trump seem this untouchable thing.
[01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:06.502]  You know that everyone gets, no one gets to be Trump, but Trump?
[01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:13.684]  Tens of millions of people voted for him after he showed his cards for years.
[01:04:13.764 --> 01:04:16.825]  Are you suggesting that they're racist?
[01:04:16.945 --> 01:04:17.245]  Yes!
[01:04:18.325 --> 01:04:20.646]  The people who vote, all the people who voted for Donald Trump are racist?
[01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:21.126]  Yes!
[01:04:21.146 --> 01:04:23.087]  Hey, is that lady Rachel Dozol's mother?
[01:04:24.076 --> 01:04:26.499]  I think that's Rachel Dozol's uncle.
[01:04:26.919 --> 01:04:32.725]  I mean, seriously, Rachel Dozol just got convicted of swindling a bunch of money in welfare.
[01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:37.310]  She doesn't have one drop of quote, African blood.
[01:04:38.351 --> 01:04:40.634]  And then this woman, it's like the new style.
[01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:42.456]  Maybe I should identify as black.
[01:04:43.644 --> 01:04:44.645]  I'm not going to comment.
[01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:46.106]  But you should have heard Don Lemon.
[01:04:46.126 --> 01:04:46.667]  No, I'm serious.
[01:04:46.707 --> 01:04:48.108]  You should have heard Don Lemon last night.
[01:04:48.128 --> 01:04:50.070]  Like a 15 watt light bulb.
[01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:52.332]  There she is.
[01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:53.773]  And then she even dresses the kid up.
[01:04:53.853 --> 01:04:55.695]  Dresses the kid like the kid's black.
[01:04:56.395 --> 01:04:57.856]  I'm black from the waist down.
[01:04:59.358 --> 01:05:00.118]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.138 --> 01:05:00.599]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.351 --> 01:05:06.533]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:05:06.993 --> 01:05:08.314]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:05:08.794 --> 01:05:20.222]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:05:21.022 --> 01:05:29.928]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:05:30.348 --> 01:05:36.192]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:05:36.212 --> 01:05:41.036]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:05:41.556 --> 01:05:43.877]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:05:44.197 --> 01:05:45.558]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:55.563]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:05:55.663 --> 01:05:57.824]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:05:58.364 --> 01:06:03.227]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:06:04.465 --> 01:06:05.366]  You got it.
[01:06:05.546 --> 01:06:11.292]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:11.372 --> 01:06:13.474]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:15.756 --> 01:06:21.401]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:31.744]  All right, coming up after our next guest leaves us at All Ties Together, we're going to have an exclusive interview from the UK with Gerard Batten, the new leader of UKIP.
[01:06:31.764 --> 01:06:33.744]  He's been there since the founding of Great Patriot.
[01:06:34.265 --> 01:06:35.645]  So that is coming up.
[01:06:35.745 --> 01:06:38.587]  Kalen Robertson is our guest right now.
[01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:48.991]  Then we have a Starbucks whistleblower of the incredible brainwashing going on with the George Soros-funded sensitivity training that everyone is now getting at Starbucks.
[01:06:49.651 --> 01:06:50.192]  But again,
[01:06:51.192 --> 01:06:59.222]  I really appreciate the listeners and everybody being so upset about what happened to Tommy Robinson, because this affects everyone.
[01:06:59.823 --> 01:07:06.111]  And of all the people out there, we all appreciate Tommy the most for standing up for free speech, being the first person to expose the Muslim
[01:07:06.972 --> 01:07:15.975]  Child grooming, mass sex, pedophile rings, now dozens of trials, hundreds and hundreds of convictions, thousands of little girls freed in now seven different cities.
[01:07:17.155 --> 01:07:21.076]  1,200 here, 1,500 there, 800 here, 600 there, couple hundred here.
[01:07:21.497 --> 01:07:27.818]  I mean, it is insane that all of this that people talked about, like Katie Hopkins 10 years ago, that
[01:07:29.719 --> 01:07:33.882]  Tommy talked about 11 years ago, and got put in prison for, that now it's out in the open.
[01:07:33.922 --> 01:07:37.504]  We really need to know this is the example of a trailblazing hero.
[01:07:38.065 --> 01:07:46.611]  But, the last year and a half, Kalen Robertson, and we gotta give him credit, he doesn't even want the credit, with his production, his camera work, his web mastering.
[01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:50.393]  I mean, he's got the best looking websites, incredible camera work, just a great artist.
[01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:52.775]  This is what the culture police do, though.
[01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.157]  He was in college, doing great grades a few years ago.
[01:07:55.817 --> 01:07:59.419]  Mildly criticized Islam, and now they're indoctrinating him into it at the school.
[01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:00.340]  Kicked out of college.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.741]  Well, now you've got to deal with him.
[01:08:01.761 --> 01:08:07.444]  So, the fact that they're pushing people out of the colleges with the police state is only backfiring.
[01:08:07.704 --> 01:08:09.185]  So, Kalen, it's great to have you here.
[01:08:09.305 --> 01:08:15.089]  I know you have to be careful what you get into, but an update on Tommy and the latest from the president.
[01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:20.032]  We don't really want to say where he is, because right now he's not being persecuted too much.
[01:08:20.932 --> 01:08:23.833]  So, certainly the establishment doesn't want to martyr out of him.
[01:08:24.153 --> 01:08:25.353]  Looks like they've jumped the shark here.
[01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:26.034]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:08:27.614 --> 01:08:32.815]  Thanks for having me once again and giving this platform to be able to publicize this case and to get the information out.
[01:08:32.915 --> 01:08:45.759]  So, I'm still getting information out in tiny, tiny drips and drabs, but the latest thing I got from Tommy is actually a personal thank you to you personally for raising the profile of this case and also for
[01:08:46.039 --> 01:08:47.000]  We're good to go.
[01:09:01.893 --> 01:09:02.394]  We're good to go.
[01:09:16.633 --> 01:09:16.993]  We're good to go.
[01:09:38.624 --> 01:09:42.287]  For a while at the beginning he felt it sounded a little bit lost, a little bit lonely.
[01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:51.574]  You know, having the entire establishment, media and politicians against you, it might feel a little bit lonely maybe being in a cell and not realizing just how much support there is on the outside.
[01:09:51.595 --> 01:09:52.996]  Plus there was a media blackout.
[01:09:53.036 --> 01:09:55.197]  It was a media blackout for what, three days?
[01:09:55.498 --> 01:09:56.518]  So he didn't even know.
[01:09:56.538 --> 01:10:03.064]  Imagine, even in the prison, if he got a newspaper or saw something, he had no idea what was going on.
[01:10:04.349 --> 01:10:05.170]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:10.174]  And he was very worried because he thought it would all just fizzle out and die down and he'd just be left in a cell to rot away.
[01:10:10.454 --> 01:10:11.295]  But it didn't happen.
[01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:17.601]  Obviously, there was major pressure put on the court, which has led to this being lifted.
[01:10:17.621 --> 01:10:21.024]  I don't think they realise the importance and the power of the internet.
[01:10:21.044 --> 01:10:22.105]  They're so out of touch.
[01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:24.667]  But people really, really pushed it and it was lifted.
[01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:25.988]  And now the country's woken up.
[01:10:26.148 --> 01:10:29.531]  And it looks like we're going to be seeing some of the biggest protests in modern British
[01:10:29.531 --> 01:10:30.192]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:42.953 --> 01:10:47.854]  I guarantee there will be some of the biggest protests that have ever happened in Britain.
[01:10:48.074 --> 01:10:57.536]  Cities will likely be turned to rubble and that's just going by the amount of anger and hostility that the people in Britain, the real people, the working people, feel towards this case.
[01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:02.597]  They've been let down by the establishment and let down by the politicians and they know it and everybody else knows it.
[01:11:02.937 --> 01:11:08.178]  Obviously we have the endorsed protest on the 9th which is expecting major turnouts.
[01:11:08.198 --> 01:11:10.398]  There's tens of thousands of people already confirmed
[01:11:10.778 --> 01:11:14.461]  It's absolutely astronomical and people cannot believe what they're seeing before their eyes.
[01:11:28.025 --> 01:11:41.091]  It's that cultural historic moment, kind of a shot heard around the world, that they try to recreate fictionally in V for Vendetta, where you've got the tens of thousands of people marching with a Guy Fawkes mask towards the parliament to remove the corrupt dictator.
[01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:48.274]  And if the police, you know, would have fired on them, it would have been a violent revolution.
[01:11:49.733 --> 01:11:50.053]  I don't
[01:12:12.226 --> 01:12:18.809]  He was running the child kidnapping trial and covering that up, evidence points towards, and trying to keep secret.
[01:12:19.089 --> 01:12:23.291]  He's the one trying to block what happened.
[01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:26.752]  And then he's the one also over sending Tommy to jail for 13 months.
[01:12:26.772 --> 01:12:32.014]  And as you said, stating this isn't about your last suspended sentence for covering one of these trials.
[01:12:32.335 --> 01:12:33.375]  I'm doing this to you now.
[01:12:33.435 --> 01:12:35.616]  Well, he's got to be rethinking that at this point.
[01:12:36.823 --> 01:12:46.048]  Yeah, it's good you mentioned that as well, because so many high-profile people, people in the media, people on the left in Britain have been criticising this and saying, well, you had a suspended sentence, he broke the law, what did he expect?
[01:12:46.508 --> 01:12:50.531]  I don't know how on earth anybody with a reasonable mind can defend this case.
[01:12:50.811 --> 01:12:52.412]  It was over in minutes.
[01:12:52.472 --> 01:12:53.552]  That's well documented.
[01:12:53.612 --> 01:12:54.413]  It's out in the open.
[01:12:55.113 --> 01:12:56.513]  It was basically a kangaroo court.
[01:12:56.653 --> 01:12:58.594]  He wasn't given access to his own lawyer.
[01:12:58.814 --> 01:13:05.235]  That's so far from any reasonable modern first world democratic process that nobody can defend it.
[01:13:05.435 --> 01:13:15.557]  And the very people who are defending this, those on the left, don't realise that the very laws that they're supporting, to jail and throw away their critics, will be used just against them as soon as the tide goes the other way.
[01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:19.918]  Not as it goes the other way, but as soon as we're wiped out, they'll come straight for them as well.
[01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.279]  And they have no idea what they're supporting.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.444]  It's going to be very, very interesting where this is going to go.
[01:13:26.464 --> 01:13:35.615]  We've seen football associations in Britain—I don't know if you know about this in America—who have been massive rivalries, who have hated each other since the 60s, 70s and 80s.
[01:13:35.635 --> 01:13:37.617]  We've seen Green Street coming together
[01:13:37.637 --> 01:13:38.457]  We're good to go.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.021]  And really make their voices heard.
[01:14:06.401 --> 01:14:08.243]  And it's completely unheard of.
[01:14:09.504 --> 01:14:11.565]  This is how it goes down in Romania.
[01:14:11.605 --> 01:14:13.267]  This is how it goes down in the old Soviet Union.
[01:14:13.307 --> 01:14:15.688]  It's how it went down here in America at Lexington and Concord.
[01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:22.613]  And the fact that they're in the right, and the fact that there are these giant pedophile rings that have been all over the news, and now it's being covered up.
[01:14:23.134 --> 01:14:26.376]  And the fact that, you know, a lot of the police and military don't want to be part of this either.
[01:14:26.396 --> 01:14:32.060]  And the fact that we know Common Purpose and the socialists are trying to suppress this and trying to Islamify things.
[01:14:33.112 --> 01:14:33.172]  And
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.301]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:14:54.361 --> 01:14:58.484]  I'd actually like to go into a little bit more of a sobering thought as well, just to signify how serious this is.
[01:14:58.564 --> 01:15:00.105]  I'll just reveal this today.
[01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:00.706]  Very, very recently,
[01:15:23.756 --> 01:15:26.639]  If you're watching this, I'm no longer with you.
[01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:30.182]  It's basically a video that will be released in the event of his death.
[01:15:30.302 --> 01:15:32.744]  And that's how serious he's taken this.
[01:15:32.764 --> 01:15:34.966]  And that's how serious we really think this is going to go.
[01:15:35.107 --> 01:15:35.427]  Stay there.
[01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:36.528]  I want to hear about this when we come back.
[01:15:36.548 --> 01:15:38.049]  That's showing how committed he is.
[01:15:38.069 --> 01:15:38.990]  And people go, that's stupid.
[01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:39.451]  Why commit?
[01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:41.673]  Everything good in life is when people commit it.
[01:15:42.373 --> 01:15:45.495]  Everything we stand on is the shoulders of men and women that stood for something.
[01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:50.719]  And it would be one thing if we were being overtaken by an advanced civilization that empowered us and had life extension.
[01:15:50.919 --> 01:15:51.779]  That's what Trump's trying to do.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:57.763]  No, it's radical Islam, the worst of the worst, that have already conquered other Islamic countries that weren't as barbarous.
[01:15:58.204 --> 01:16:01.126]  We'll be back with our special guest, Kalyn Robertson.
[01:16:01.146 --> 01:16:01.466]  Stay with us.
[01:16:02.881 --> 01:16:06.843]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[01:16:06.903 --> 01:16:14.367]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[01:16:14.427 --> 01:16:20.250]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:26.634]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[01:16:27.674 --> 01:16:28.415]  But he didn't give up.
[01:16:29.701 --> 01:16:30.161]  And he won.
[01:16:31.902 --> 01:16:33.303]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[01:16:34.084 --> 01:16:38.166]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[01:16:39.407 --> 01:16:42.649]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[01:16:43.749 --> 01:16:44.650]  And they all died.
[01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:46.231]  All 180 plus men.
[01:16:48.112 --> 01:16:51.614]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[01:16:53.215 --> 01:16:57.458]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[01:16:57.638 --> 01:16:59.279]  But I know this.
[01:17:01.801 --> 01:17:06.326]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced.
[01:17:07.287 --> 01:17:14.293]  With this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[01:17:15.274 --> 01:17:22.101]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[01:17:23.581 --> 01:17:27.282]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:35.745]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[01:17:38.145 --> 01:17:47.648]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:53.394]  And whether it's colloidal silver for $19.95, the very best out there.
[01:17:54.395 --> 01:17:56.537]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[01:17:56.917 --> 01:17:59.139]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:00.661]  PQQ.
[01:18:00.681 --> 01:18:00.881]  Go Q10.
[01:18:03.131 --> 01:18:10.839]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:23.273]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[01:18:24.974 --> 01:18:26.655]  Think about that.
[01:18:26.715 --> 01:18:27.376]  It's $74 right now.
[01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:33.241]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[01:18:34.282 --> 01:18:35.603]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[01:18:35.643 --> 01:18:43.990]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:46.031]  So I signed a bigger contract, got a better deal.
[01:18:47.052 --> 01:18:52.816]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're going to want lower price on this and get the best product.
[01:18:52.836 --> 01:18:54.056]  So I've not gambled.
[01:18:54.637 --> 01:18:55.497]  I know you want value.
[01:18:55.537 --> 01:18:57.258]  So we've bought even more of it.
[01:18:58.159 --> 01:19:00.240]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:07.324]  And we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're going to find anywhere.
[01:19:07.984 --> 01:19:08.685]  DNA Force.
[01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:10.146]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[01:19:10.286 --> 01:19:10.826]  Thousands of them.
[01:19:11.106 --> 01:19:12.547]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[01:19:12.987 --> 01:19:13.948]  It is dramatic.
[01:19:15.143 --> 01:19:22.929]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:32.156]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[01:19:32.696 --> 01:19:39.261]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at MFullRestore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:47.748]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[01:19:47.948 --> 01:19:48.408]  That's fine.
[01:19:49.849 --> 01:19:50.890]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[01:19:51.330 --> 01:19:52.010]  I'm funded by you.
[01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:53.131]  So thank you all.
[01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:58.794]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:02.096]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[01:20:06.438 --> 01:20:09.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.884 --> 01:20:19.584]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.745 --> 01:20:38.248]  I'm Alex Jones, riding shotgun with me is Owen Schroyer.
[01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.508]  Kalen Roberts is with us for one more segment.
[01:20:42.328 --> 01:20:46.349]  And we're talking about Tommy Robinson sentenced secretly to 13 months in prison.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:54.771]  For not covering any details of a giant trial into secret pedophile networks.
[01:20:56.233 --> 01:20:57.936]  In just one case, hundreds of victim girls.
[01:20:58.697 --> 01:21:00.220]  Dozens of men reportedly involved.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.062]  A lot of the evidence pretty open and shut.
[01:21:03.356 --> 01:21:04.977]  No, just for being there and reporting on it.
[01:21:05.017 --> 01:21:08.079]  So now, coming up tomorrow, it'll be seven days.
[01:21:08.259 --> 01:21:10.881]  Tommy Robinson has been in the hoose, gal.
[01:21:11.642 --> 01:21:33.056]  So what can you tell us, Kalen, and jump in here with any questions you have, Owen, riding shotgun, with what else he said, how he's doing, how the family's doing, what's coming up next, and how they're going to handle him as the political prisoner, really blowing it open to the world that England and the UK is joining the EU in serious draconian police state activities.
[01:21:34.636 --> 01:21:37.357]  Well, I don't think he's very surprised.
[01:21:37.377 --> 01:21:39.558]  We've only, as I said, had drips and drabs of information.
[01:21:39.778 --> 01:21:43.939]  We actually can confirm that we'll be able to get much more contact with him from tomorrow afternoon.
[01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:47.900]  And as soon as we do, we'll come straight on to him for words and I'll keep you up to date with everything that's been happening.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:53.562]  To go back, obviously, he's personally thanked you for all the support, for the people who have supported.
[01:21:54.883 --> 01:21:57.025]  He said that he supports protests that's happening on the 9th.
[01:21:57.065 --> 01:22:02.110]  He said he supported all the things that people have been doing to try and raise the profile of this.
[01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:04.813]  He basically wants to make a point that this isn't just about him.
[01:22:05.073 --> 01:22:08.436]  He wants people to go out and protest about what's happening in Britain.
[01:22:08.817 --> 01:22:12.020]  He is going to go down sort of as the one who signifies what's going on.
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.843]  He wants people to go out and protest that, not even his imprisonment.
[01:22:15.123 --> 01:22:16.264]  And that's what's going to be happening.
[01:22:16.284 --> 01:22:20.627]  Oh, and by the way, the enemy will always try to divide groups and do things.
[01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:24.811]  I've also seen a few things on the web like, oh, this Kalen guy, he doesn't speak for Robertson.
[01:22:25.752 --> 01:22:33.257]  Tommy told me that if anything happened to him, because we're talking about, you know, building a whole studio, you know, really expanding here in the next few months and this happened.
[01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:34.659]  I said, who do I talk to?
[01:22:34.679 --> 01:22:35.800]  And he said, well, not my wife.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:36.680]  She's private.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.781]  You talk to Kalen.
[01:22:38.141 --> 01:22:39.202]  He's my right hand guy.
[01:22:39.482 --> 01:22:40.944]  He's the guy helping us get to the next level.
[01:22:40.984 --> 01:22:42.245]  So Tommy has told me
[01:22:42.885 --> 01:22:43.326]  Oh, thanks very much.
[01:22:43.346 --> 01:22:44.387]  I mean, that's the case.
[01:22:44.407 --> 01:22:45.728]  I mean, people have seen we work together from
[01:22:58.399 --> 01:22:58.820]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:32.025]  Yeah, I mean, the next stage of this is we also, as well as the legal battle, we want to be meeting with Pauline Hanson, Gerrit Wilders and the German, we actually want to arrange a meeting with the German Member of Parliament, a politician who said that he actually wanted to give asylum, political asylum, to Tommy in this case.
[01:23:32.245 --> 01:23:39.828]  Can you imagine how, you know, that signifies how bad things have really gotten in this country when Germany is offering political asylum?
[01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.391]  But yeah, so those are the next stages of everything.
[01:23:43.671 --> 01:23:46.313]  Obviously, we've had a very, very strange mixed response with this.
[01:23:46.333 --> 01:23:49.856]  We've had people on the left saying, well, you know, what does he expect?
[01:23:49.896 --> 01:23:50.376]  And you know what?
[01:23:50.396 --> 01:23:52.818]  You say to that, well, maybe, maybe they're right.
[01:23:53.019 --> 01:23:53.879]  What did he expect?
[01:23:53.939 --> 01:24:04.208]  Being in a totalitarian state and trying to speak out against the truth and trying to actually notify people about the atrocities and the rape gangs and the politics and the problems of Islam.
[01:24:04.548 --> 01:24:05.790]  Maybe what did he expect?
[01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:07.031]  Probably to go to prison.
[01:24:07.191 --> 01:24:13.619]  But he still did it because he wanted to defend the rights of this country and speak out for the people that have been silenced.
[01:24:13.999 --> 01:24:15.922]  And he's absolutely a hero for doing that.
[01:24:18.585 --> 01:24:20.888]  That said, it's like telling
[01:24:22.543 --> 01:24:25.425]  An old black lady that didn't want to sit at the back of the bus.
[01:24:26.066 --> 01:24:27.547]  Rosa Parks, what did you expect?
[01:24:27.888 --> 01:24:28.528]  You got arrested.
[01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:42.240]  Tommy was going out there to peacefully challenge their authoritarian garbage that wasn't even in place a decade ago in England and say no to common purpose and this whole creeping intimidation of the population.
[01:24:43.851 --> 01:24:44.632]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:24:44.832 --> 01:24:49.155]  I mean, the police are absolutely terrified of Islam, and he's highlighted those things.
[01:24:49.395 --> 01:24:55.801]  We've actually had reports of Muslims who have been celebrating this, who have been talking to reporters, saying that it's a really, really great thing.
[01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:59.724]  I know that there's a couple of Infowars reporters in Britain right now.
[01:24:59.844 --> 01:25:05.048]  I want to take them to these areas and actually show them what's going on, and show them the people who are supporting this and celebrating this.
[01:25:05.068 --> 01:25:05.408]  Please do.
[01:25:06.429 --> 01:25:12.733]  Yeah, we're going to be working on that right now and it's going to be incredibly important to carry on the legacy that Tommy stopped.
[01:25:12.913 --> 01:25:14.074]  Because things aren't going to stop.
[01:25:14.454 --> 01:25:17.536]  We spoke to Tommy recently and he said that he wants to carry on his channel.
[01:25:17.816 --> 01:25:22.278]  We're going to be carrying on making all the videos we have been doing before without him presenting them.
[01:25:22.558 --> 01:25:23.799]  They can speak for themselves.
[01:25:23.859 --> 01:25:24.900]  We'll do it through Infowars.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.161]  We'll do it through his personal channel.
[01:25:26.341 --> 01:25:27.601]  We'll carry on planning through it.
[01:25:27.801 --> 01:25:31.243]  Because even though they can try and silence him, it's absolutely not going to work.
[01:25:31.444 --> 01:25:35.526]  The legacy, the content, what he has to say has started a ball rolling that's absolutely
[01:25:35.606 --> 01:25:38.527]  By the way, you brought up a point I wanted to get to, and Owen's jumping in here.
[01:25:40.207 --> 01:25:48.009]  Our own Harrison Smith and our camera person that's there with him, they, about half the folks are like, good, lock Tommy up.
[01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:55.291]  The others are horrified, but to find that many people are like, I want to lock people up and have them disappear for criticizing pedophiles.
[01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:58.232]  I mean, what a whacked out level of sycophants.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.020]  Oh, exactly.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.421]  I don't think they realise that those people are going to be locked up as well.
[01:26:02.521 --> 01:26:10.705]  Anyone with any political agendas that are not absolutely in total support of the totalitarian state ideology or total communism are going to be locked up as well.
[01:26:10.885 --> 01:26:12.686]  I don't know how these people don't realise that.
[01:26:12.726 --> 01:26:16.168]  This is the natural progression we are seeing throughout history.
[01:26:16.428 --> 01:26:16.668]  We're good.
[01:26:31.624 --> 01:26:34.425]  I would say about 100 years ago, the same things were happening to people there.
[01:26:34.645 --> 01:26:51.253]  And it's shocking that people just want to override it and say, well, just because I don't fundamentally agree with the content of what Tommy says, or, you know what, because he's kind of working class, and I guess he's a little bit icky, and it doesn't really make you look very good, then he shouldn't be thrown away in silence, because it doesn't really suit what I want to say.
[01:26:51.493 --> 01:26:54.355]  Those people are totally, totally mistaken.
[01:26:54.615 --> 01:26:56.056]  They have no idea what's coming.
[01:26:56.276 --> 01:27:00.798]  And if they don't join with this, and they don't carry on with it, they're going to be taken down next.
[01:27:01.078 --> 01:27:01.478]  That's right.
[01:27:01.518 --> 01:27:02.538]  This is history happening.
[01:27:02.558 --> 01:27:03.959]  We're not just puffing this up.
[01:27:03.999 --> 01:27:05.099]  You can feel that magic.
[01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:07.700]  It's really turned it around.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.920]  It's showing what they wanted to do in the dark of the night.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.181]  And thanks to your courage, the thousands have showed up at the demonstrations.
[01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:17.602]  And it's only building, as you said, with the football hooligans, as they're called, unifying.
[01:27:18.082 --> 01:27:21.763]  This has got to scare the forces of radical globalism and radical Islam.
[01:27:21.823 --> 01:27:21.963]  Owen?
[01:27:22.483 --> 01:27:28.110]  Kaylen, I'm just curious if you can provide us any details or the goals of your upcoming legal battle.
[01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:30.052]  Are you going to try to get Tommy out of prison?
[01:27:30.173 --> 01:27:34.618]  Are you going to try to go after the judge for a wrongful incarceration?
[01:27:34.758 --> 01:27:36.420]  Are you looking at free... Oh yeah, that's the question.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.261]  How do we get Tommy out?
[01:27:37.662 --> 01:27:38.643]  Or free speech laws?
[01:27:38.683 --> 01:27:40.966]  So what is the goals of the legal battle coming up here?
[01:27:41.963 --> 01:27:57.118]  So I've been in lots of close talks with the legal team that we just formed together and they really don't want any information coming out about how we really plan to tackle this because if they get any word of it then they're going to know what the plan is and how we're going to do it and they're going to try and you know bring up defences and sort of stop it from happening.
[01:27:57.279 --> 01:27:58.300]  But the main goal
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.261]  Is to get him out of prison as soon as possible, as fast as possible.
[01:28:02.521 --> 01:28:04.442]  Right now, he is relatively safe.
[01:28:04.502 --> 01:28:08.403]  He's surrounded by people who are on the side with him.
[01:28:08.884 --> 01:28:24.229]  Fortunately, the very wing and department of the prison that he's in is relatively safe, but he could be moved at any moment to one of the thousands of radical Islamic training grounds that are prisons in Britain, and it could be coming very, very ugly, very, very quickly.
[01:28:24.269 --> 01:28:26.330]  So the number one goal right now is to get him free.
[01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:29.492]  As absolutely fast as possible so we can get back on the ground.
[01:28:29.793 --> 01:28:32.114]  Does he have regular access to a telephone?
[01:28:32.275 --> 01:28:34.196]  Is he able to regularly access a telephone?
[01:28:35.717 --> 01:28:36.918]  For seconds a day.
[01:28:37.018 --> 01:28:39.280]  Very, very, very small amounts of information coming out.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:45.886]  But we will be able to get more information out after tomorrow afternoon once we've got a new line of communication set up.
[01:28:46.277 --> 01:28:52.641]  And let's not forget, returning Al-Qaeda and ISIS fighters get free housing in the UK, but Tommy Robinson can't even use his phone.
[01:28:52.941 --> 01:28:56.743]  I want to do three more minutes with you on the other side with one other point that will let you get back to your important work.
[01:28:57.044 --> 01:29:00.446]  Kaelin Robertson at Kaelin Rob on Twitter.
[01:29:00.466 --> 01:29:00.906]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:05.933 --> 01:29:07.333]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[01:29:07.393 --> 01:29:08.834]  Victor, you're calling.
[01:29:08.894 --> 01:29:09.254]  Go ahead.
[01:29:09.354 --> 01:29:09.634]  Yes.
[01:29:10.074 --> 01:29:10.794]  Hi, Alex.
[01:29:10.894 --> 01:29:17.095]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[01:29:17.295 --> 01:29:21.296]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[01:29:21.516 --> 01:29:22.976]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[01:29:23.336 --> 01:29:32.978]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[01:29:33.858 --> 01:29:38.560]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:46.422]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[01:29:46.442 --> 01:29:52.263]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[01:29:52.404 --> 01:29:57.705]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:00.786]  And it's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[01:30:02.634 --> 01:30:03.995]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:30:04.275 --> 01:30:05.556]  You can't survive without it.
[01:30:05.756 --> 01:30:06.656]  But where do you get it?
[01:30:06.956 --> 01:30:12.720]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:18.663]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:30:18.863 --> 01:30:35.747]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:30:36.127 --> 01:30:38.248]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:30:38.608 --> 01:30:39.809]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:31:02.401 --> 01:31:04.722]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[01:32:12.302 --> 01:32:19.665]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:32:20.345 --> 01:32:26.707]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[01:33:21.673 --> 01:33:25.954]  TommyRobinsonOnline.com That's where you donate.
[01:33:26.395 --> 01:33:27.535]  That's the only place.
[01:33:27.575 --> 01:33:35.638]  TommyRobinsonOnline.com And I hope and pray I never end up getting put in prison for my speech.
[01:33:35.978 --> 01:33:38.139]  But I would hope if
[01:33:51.553 --> 01:33:56.557]  Like Reuters calls for, they want us, quote, destroyed, shut down, annihilated with fake lawsuits.
[01:33:57.337 --> 01:34:01.300]  And where they put a bunch of lies and defamation in an article and then call for me to be destroyed.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.822]  That's like everyday Reuters AP.
[01:34:03.882 --> 01:34:06.724]  I mean, Reuters never puts out editorials like that.
[01:34:07.165 --> 01:34:09.767]  Because they understand they've got to shut down the truth.
[01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:16.771]  I hope whatever happens to me, you'll support my wife and my children, folks, in the fight to get the truth out, because they want to destroy leaders.
[01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:18.331]  If they can do that, they're going to win.
[01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:20.712]  Katie Hopkins was on Tucker Carlson last night.
[01:34:20.732 --> 01:34:23.833]  It was a very powerful interview that I'm going to play a clip of in the next segment.
[01:34:24.674 --> 01:34:30.156]  And she talks about UK on a knife edge after Tommy Robinson arrest.
[01:34:30.936 --> 01:34:36.259]  They have a state-sponsored play playing in different cities saying the assassination of Katie Hopkins.
[01:34:36.919 --> 01:34:39.060]  And they say, basically, we hope she gets killed.
[01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:42.873]  They praised Congressman Scalise getting shot on CNN.
[01:34:44.815 --> 01:34:48.398]  Joy Behar said, God, I hope Trump's in Trump Tower when it had that big fire.
[01:34:49.579 --> 01:34:55.944]  These are the violent pig-like creatures who then point their fingers at us and tell us when there's a mass shooting it's our fault.
[01:34:56.445 --> 01:35:03.150]  Another one of their Prozac heads did something, like Nick Cruz, who was being protected by the state under the Promise Program when he committed all these crimes.
[01:35:04.079 --> 01:35:06.101]  And the FBI and police have been called 39 times?
[01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:08.242]  I'm sorry, it's 39 times now, not 23.
[01:35:08.583 --> 01:35:09.884]  New numbers are out, CBS News.
[01:35:11.525 --> 01:35:18.051]  So, there's the headline, Daily Beast, is it okay to stage assassinate Katie Hopkins?
[01:35:18.091 --> 01:35:21.573]  These people mean business, but they want somebody else to kill somebody.
[01:35:21.974 --> 01:35:29.740]  That's why they always claim that I'm trying to get somebody to go hurt somebody or attack shooting victims' families, because that's what they're saying.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.623]  That's what the media is pushing, is somebody else to be violent.
[01:35:33.263 --> 01:35:38.765]  So we're going to get to that with Owen Schroeder here in a moment, but finishing up with Kalen Robinson, again, really Tommy Robinson's manager.
[01:35:39.245 --> 01:35:51.689]  It's been so good the last year and a half watching Tommy go from, you know, having really no support and his own camera work to you just really teleporting, you know, his work to the next level and now seeing the history change.
[01:35:52.329 --> 01:35:54.790]  I just wanted to, you know, finish up with how folks donate.
[01:35:55.570 --> 01:36:01.693]  Uh, and just that rousing speech you gave on Sunday that went so viral on air with us about the real awakening that's happening.
[01:36:01.713 --> 01:36:06.075]  What do you think of Katie Hopkins and her point about Europe being on a knife edge, the UK being on a knife edge?
[01:36:07.416 --> 01:36:11.118]  Well, there's a very interesting crossover between Tommy and Katie and it's very, very similar.
[01:36:11.238 --> 01:36:15.700]  They just seem to be even more open about it with Katie talking openly about assassinating her.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.641]  I don't know why they think they can get away with that, but she said something interesting on top of it.
[01:36:18.661 --> 01:36:22.143]  She said that there's a real feeling that the establishment is against the
[01:36:22.363 --> 01:36:23.143]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:43.513 --> 01:36:44.233]  We're good.
[01:37:00.223 --> 01:37:03.765]  And now they're emboldened, they're empowered to be able to take it out onto the streets.
[01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:06.767]  V for Vendetta analogy, absolutely fantastic analogy.
[01:37:07.068 --> 01:37:12.971]  It looked really, without the explosions, but the people trying to desperately climb over the gates of Downing Street, it was astounding.
[01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:14.692]  I've never seen anything like that before.
[01:37:14.913 --> 01:37:23.278]  And Tommy and I have been to hundreds and hundreds of marches throughout the last year, and we've seen them on the left, we've seen marches on the right, more sort of parades, you'd call them, on the left.
[01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:27.139]  And there has never quite been an anger like this.
[01:37:27.399 --> 01:37:28.360]  And that's because they messed up.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.420]  They completely messed up.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:37.883]  When Tommy was in the EDL, when he was in the English Defence League, they were sort of in prison and no one would know anything about it except for the 10, 20, 30,000 people who would go to his marches.
[01:37:38.103 --> 01:37:47.466]  But now things are massively different and that's because of info wars and the internet and sites like yours which are publicising and making a big deal and telling everything about what they're doing and exposing all of it.
[01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:52.548]  And that has created a huge tectonic shift within the politics and the groundwork
[01:37:52.568 --> 01:37:53.148]  We're good to go.
[01:38:19.213 --> 01:38:22.800]  And it's absolutely right and people should go out and they should be angry and that's
[01:38:23.993 --> 01:38:24.994]  That's how this country's feeling.
[01:38:25.014 --> 01:38:25.374]  You're right.
[01:38:25.414 --> 01:38:29.316]  There is an amazing Kalyn Robinson and there is a chain reaction happening.
[01:38:29.356 --> 01:38:31.958]  I think an event horizon has been crossed here.
[01:38:32.438 --> 01:38:36.961]  And I was just thinking about how your own female camera lady, Ms.
[01:38:37.001 --> 01:38:41.024]  Brown, got attacked by the nine Antifa guys and she fought back better than they did.
[01:38:41.044 --> 01:38:48.128]  And in the newest footage of Antifa men just beating up Trump supporter women and then how they're targeting Katie Hopkins for death.
[01:38:48.148 --> 01:38:50.350]  I mean, what is the left's particular
[01:38:52.112 --> 01:38:53.833]  Salivation and attacking women.
[01:38:54.113 --> 01:38:55.474]  I notice people in wheelchairs too.
[01:38:55.514 --> 01:38:58.517]  Is it they're such cowards that they think a woman's an easier target?
[01:39:00.058 --> 01:39:01.439]  No, it's because they don't see them as human.
[01:39:01.539 --> 01:39:05.903]  The left do use the very tactics that the Germans used within the Second World War.
[01:39:05.923 --> 01:39:06.763]  They dehumanize.
[01:39:06.783 --> 01:39:07.584]  They dehumanize the Jews.
[01:39:07.624 --> 01:39:10.426]  They do the same thing to anybody left of communism now.
[01:39:10.647 --> 01:39:14.730]  So they don't see them as women or they see them as real people or a class of people or anything like that.
[01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:18.413]  They see them as traitors, as disgusting animals who should be wiped out.
[01:39:18.453 --> 01:39:19.253]  That's what it is.
[01:39:19.334 --> 01:39:20.895]  They think they own women.
[01:39:21.315 --> 01:39:24.057]  Like, particularly black supporters of Trump get attacked everywhere.
[01:39:24.337 --> 01:39:26.238]  Because, no, the Democrats own you, they say.
[01:39:26.818 --> 01:39:31.541]  Well, I'm really impressed with the work you're doing, but the big thing is, how do we get Tommy Robinson out?
[01:39:31.581 --> 01:39:33.262]  The answer is, we don't get into strategy.
[01:39:33.922 --> 01:39:34.803]  That is a great point.
[01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:35.864]  Thank you, Kalen.
[01:39:35.964 --> 01:39:36.544]  Any other questions?
[01:39:37.284 --> 01:39:45.009]  No, I was just going to make sure that people got the right website to donate at, because we know that with the new online donation deal, you know, people can prop up other sites.
[01:39:45.049 --> 01:39:47.230]  So, TommyRobinsonOnline.com.
[01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:50.312]  Alright, thank you so much, Kalen, and thanks for showing our reporters around.
[01:39:51.431 --> 01:39:54.394]  Thanks for having me and thanks for doing this for Tommy.
[01:39:54.575 --> 01:39:56.817]  It's quite incredible.
[01:39:56.837 --> 01:39:58.138]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[01:39:58.179 --> 01:39:58.499]  Thank you.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.001]  We're all in this together.
[01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:01.322]  We are all Tommy Robinson now.
[01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:09.932]  Well, Alex, let me just tell you, if they took you away to prison, I wouldn't be able to host the show for you because I'd be scaling the walls of a building probably.
[01:40:11.213 --> 01:40:11.714]  I tell you.
[01:40:14.649 --> 01:40:18.850]  I'm not scared of dying, but I think being locked up in a supermax would not be fun.
[01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:23.792]  Well, I don't think, the difference though, I mean, I don't know what Tommy's situation is right now.
[01:40:23.832 --> 01:40:24.452]  They say it's okay.
[01:40:24.492 --> 01:40:25.632]  He's in a pretty high security prison.
[01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:28.573]  But I don't think, I think people, I mean, I don't think people hate you.
[01:40:28.593 --> 01:40:31.974]  I mean, in the prisons, I don't think there would be much hatred for you, honestly.
[01:40:31.994 --> 01:40:33.814]  I think that they would probably actually admire you.
[01:40:33.854 --> 01:40:36.215]  No, no, no, no, I'm not afraid of getting killed in prison.
[01:40:37.116 --> 01:40:39.116]  I'd be afraid to be locked up in solitary confinement.
[01:40:39.197 --> 01:40:43.418]  Oh, you mean just the actual act of being in a cell and just not being able to be free?
[01:40:43.438 --> 01:40:46.238]  No, I'd rather be out in general population fighting if I needed to.
[01:40:46.258 --> 01:40:47.739]  It's a lot more entertaining.
[01:40:48.439 --> 01:40:54.400]  Well, I hope I wouldn't be alone, but, you know, I'll find a way to scale that building, Alex, and I'll probably end up right next to you.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.461]  Man, I tell you, they say everywhere they want to arrest us, they want to kill us.
[01:40:59.181 --> 01:41:00.002]  They mean business, man.
[01:41:00.042 --> 01:41:00.702]  These are liberals.
[01:41:00.762 --> 01:41:02.502]  They will put you in death camps.
[01:41:03.022 --> 01:41:05.003]  Communists killed, what, 120 million people?
[01:41:05.043 --> 01:41:05.583]  Hitler killed
[01:41:06.522 --> 01:41:07.963]  Physically, probably 10 million.
[01:41:08.683 --> 01:41:10.845]  Well, what's the Chinese Communist government total?
[01:41:10.865 --> 01:41:13.006]  I mean, you're looking at, I think, almost 100 million now.
[01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:19.330]  And then you have Elizabeth Warren go on national television and say that the whole of the Chinese government is good.
[01:41:19.730 --> 01:41:21.751]  By the way, that was so crazy on Monday.
[01:41:21.771 --> 01:41:22.712]  That was going to be my top story.
[01:41:22.732 --> 01:41:23.812]  That's why I get frustrated.
[01:41:24.152 --> 01:41:28.915]  I didn't even get to Elizabeth Warren saying, as a whole, the best government in the world is China.
[01:41:29.876 --> 01:41:31.777]  They killed 84 million under Mao.
[01:41:31.797 --> 01:41:34.258]  And like you said, another 15 or so since then.
[01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:35.179]  They admit it.
[01:41:35.499 --> 01:41:41.866]  They have mobile execution vans and you've got this crazy woman, Pocahontas, up here.
[01:41:42.426 --> 01:41:43.647]  God almighty save us.
[01:41:43.828 --> 01:41:50.154]  This is why the audience support at InfoWarsTore.com is so important because we're live for 10 hours a day now.
[01:41:50.474 --> 01:41:52.056]  We still can't cover everything.
[01:41:52.336 --> 01:41:53.777]  We still can't get you all the clips.
[01:41:53.938 --> 01:41:55.279]  We still can't get you all the breaking news.
[01:41:55.479 --> 01:41:57.241]  So that's why we want to go live even more.
[01:41:57.361 --> 01:41:58.182]  I totally forgot.
[01:42:00.484 --> 01:42:01.185]  Look at Reuters.
[01:42:01.285 --> 01:42:02.507]  Chinese government.
[01:42:02.727 --> 01:42:05.350]  It says Peter Thiel's next target should be Infowars.
[01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:06.191]  That's Reuters.
[01:42:06.712 --> 01:42:07.913]  Reuters doesn't do editorials.
[01:42:08.534 --> 01:42:10.336]  And it's written like, destroy Jones.
[01:42:10.576 --> 01:42:11.577]  He attacks the family.
[01:42:11.617 --> 01:42:11.938]  He's evil.
[01:42:11.958 --> 01:42:12.819]  It's all these lies.
[01:42:12.839 --> 01:42:15.862]  And it says Jones sends gangs after people.
[01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:17.043]  Shut him down.
[01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:17.804]  I hate him.
[01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:19.026]  He needs to be destroyed.
[01:42:19.346 --> 01:42:21.527]  That's the malice of forethought with intent to do harm.
[01:42:22.007 --> 01:42:24.608]  They're the ones lying about me, saying they want to destroy me.
[01:42:25.188 --> 01:42:26.288]  Hundreds of articles a day.
[01:42:26.348 --> 01:42:29.109]  I mean, what is it we're doing makes them so scared?
[01:42:29.349 --> 01:42:31.290]  Because we've got their dirty number.
[01:42:31.570 --> 01:42:36.452]  That's the scariest part about it, is that you have people that are now hearsay zombies.
[01:42:36.872 --> 01:42:40.013]  They just hear what somebody said about Alex Jones, and then they believe it.
[01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.193]  No research of their own.
[01:42:41.494 --> 01:42:44.074]  As soon as you question it, immediately we've seen it.
[01:42:44.114 --> 01:42:45.335]  They hit that bucket.
[01:42:45.555 --> 01:42:48.816]  That's why they said they've got to get us off the air, so they can then just lie.
[01:42:48.956 --> 01:42:49.537]  No!
[01:42:49.637 --> 01:42:51.981]  Did you know Jones killed the Jews in World War II?
[01:42:52.021 --> 01:42:53.624]  Did you know George Soros cut Hitler's head off?
[01:42:53.965 --> 01:42:57.090]  Did you know George Soros, you know, when he goes to the bathroom, four-leaf clovers come out?
[01:42:57.411 --> 01:42:59.755]  You know Alex Jones that goes to the bathroom, dead little kids come out?
[01:42:59.775 --> 01:43:01.338]  You know, it's like, just total upside down.

[01:45:08.993 --> 01:45:10.894]  X2 is from a deep earth crystal source.
[01:45:10.994 --> 01:45:14.495]  All the other iodine is bound, meaning you don't absorb very much of it.
[01:45:15.176 --> 01:45:16.816]  People have great results with this.
[01:45:17.117 --> 01:45:18.097]  It's the good halogen.
[01:45:18.117 --> 01:45:19.658]  Research the bad halogens.
[01:45:19.718 --> 01:45:21.198]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[01:45:21.258 --> 01:45:23.980]  Read the 6,000 plus reviews.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:24.820]  4.8 stars.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.241]  98% rating by Power Reviews.
[01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:29.182]  This has changed so many people's lives.
[01:45:29.282 --> 01:45:29.442]  Yes.
[01:45:29.822 --> 01:45:30.183]  It is.
[01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:30.763]  Amazing.
[01:45:30.823 --> 01:45:34.306]  And when you don't have the good halogen, folks, the bad halogens get into your glands.
[01:45:34.326 --> 01:45:36.028]  It totally changes your whole system.
[01:45:36.108 --> 01:45:37.069]  Experience it for yourself.
[01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:40.051]  A lot of people detox in about three weeks, so be careful when you're on it.
[01:45:40.071 --> 01:45:42.734]  I would take it slow, take about a half dose the first month or so.
[01:45:42.834 --> 01:45:46.297]  It made me lazy, though, because I used to work out really hard and weigh 30, 40 more pounds.
[01:45:46.417 --> 01:45:49.260]  As soon as I went on this, I don't have to work out as much anymore, and I don't
[01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:54.542]  Get fat, even though I'm older, just because of what it did to my whole system, my whole metabolic system.
[01:45:54.562 --> 01:45:56.382]  My skin, everything got healthier.
[01:45:56.482 --> 01:45:57.463]  My hair got healthier.
[01:45:57.543 --> 01:46:01.044]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:01.664 --> 01:46:10.107]  And again, those of you that are financially supporting us, you're breaking the back of the globalists and Soros and Hillary and all their garbage and their lawsuits and Google trying to delist us.
[01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:13.868]  You are overpowering them when you share the links, the articles.
[01:46:14.528 --> 01:46:22.572]  Person-to-person, mouth-to-mouth, ear-to-ear, you are breaking their attempt to have an iron curtain come down across this country.
[01:46:22.992 --> 01:46:24.273]  But they are pressing hard.
[01:46:24.293 --> 01:46:29.395]  It's a very dangerous game because it's exposing their tyranny to everyone.
[01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:31.576]  And Trump is beginning to move against them.
[01:46:31.756 --> 01:46:33.838]  We've got to keep him in there to do that, and he's got to know.
[01:46:33.918 --> 01:46:40.523]  They're shutting down the grassroots that is 90% of Trump's power ahead of the midterms.
[01:46:40.583 --> 01:46:45.807]  They are coming, not just for Trump, but for the First Amendment now, and I cannot raise the alarm enough.
[01:46:46.107 --> 01:46:49.290]  They think you're just going to incrementally censor and you're going to get sick of hearing about it and just go to sleep.
[01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:51.051]  Folks, they've been persecuting the churches.
[01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:52.572]  They've been persecuting the veterans groups.
[01:46:52.793 --> 01:46:54.714]  They've been persecuting anybody that's a patriot.
[01:46:54.954 --> 01:46:56.475]  And now they're going to the next level.
[01:46:56.495 --> 01:46:59.458]  We can't roll over to this intimidation or we'll lose everything.
[01:47:05.931 --> 01:47:08.535]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.739 --> 01:47:28.502]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:47:28.822 --> 01:47:33.145]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:33.545 --> 01:47:34.826]  That's right, controlling the narrative.
[01:47:34.846 --> 01:47:37.228]  I want to get into some positive points here in a moment with Owen Troyer.
[01:47:37.328 --> 01:47:40.390]  And then, he robbed a shotgun of you once.
[01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:41.872]  You got your own 3-4 hour show coming up.
[01:47:41.892 --> 01:47:43.633]  I just invited you in for a segment, but I've been making you stay in here.
[01:47:43.653 --> 01:47:44.674]  It's good to have you here with us.
[01:47:44.994 --> 01:47:46.095]  He's going to be hosting for 3 hours.
[01:47:46.115 --> 01:47:48.196]  Roger Stone, The War Room, coming up at 3 o'clock today.
[01:47:48.596 --> 01:47:49.517]  Central Standard Time.
[01:47:49.557 --> 01:47:51.859]  But, if you think I'm joking around,
[01:47:53.772 --> 01:47:55.032]  I forgot about this on Monday.
[01:47:55.052 --> 01:47:56.013]  I was going to lead the show.
[01:47:56.273 --> 01:48:01.474]  Senator Warren endorses Communist China's government for their management, their style.
[01:48:01.954 --> 01:48:05.035]  Remember when Mao Zedong died in the late 70s?
[01:48:05.595 --> 01:48:10.116]  There was an editorial in the New York Times with David Rockefeller praising it, saying, this is the model we need.
[01:48:11.396 --> 01:48:14.137]  A few thousand billionaires, a bunch of slaves,
[01:48:15.615 --> 01:48:16.576]  No workers' comp.
[01:48:17.336 --> 01:48:19.898]  The bathroom is you go out and poop in the street at most factories.
[01:48:20.259 --> 01:48:22.120]  Daycares, you chain your kids up with light poles.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:22.700]  I'm not kidding.
[01:48:23.161 --> 01:48:24.382]  The rivers catch on fire.
[01:48:25.543 --> 01:48:27.024]  They sell political dissidents organs.
[01:48:27.104 --> 01:48:27.484]  Buddhists.
[01:48:28.805 --> 01:48:30.547]  Even liberals now go, I hate the Dalai Lama.
[01:48:30.567 --> 01:48:31.367]  He's a piece of crap.
[01:48:31.407 --> 01:48:33.789]  You know, that's because it's liberal to hate the Dalai Lama now.
[01:48:33.809 --> 01:48:34.490]  Liberals used to like him.
[01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:38.753]  But OK, the Dalai Lama, some, you know, well, it's some ancestral dictatorship.
[01:48:38.793 --> 01:48:40.014]  OK, well, let's move on from that.
[01:48:40.034 --> 01:48:42.776]  Nothing compared to the Communist Chinese.
[01:48:43.396 --> 01:48:45.258]  Just regular Buddhists are killed.
[01:48:46.772 --> 01:48:46.952]  I don't
[01:49:06.001 --> 01:49:08.883]  Plutocracy, a dictatorship of a central committee.
[01:49:09.143 --> 01:49:09.583]  Here it is.
[01:49:10.504 --> 01:49:11.505]  I want this to work.
[01:49:11.705 --> 01:49:20.810]  I want this to work to reduce the threat to South Korea, to Japan, to our allies in the region, to the United States of America, to the entire world.
[01:49:21.651 --> 01:49:23.572]  But it really takes a strategy.
[01:49:23.632 --> 01:49:25.634]  And I look at the comparison with China.
[01:49:26.654 --> 01:49:27.995]  Look at what China's doing.
[01:49:28.095 --> 01:49:30.275]  China's got the long-term arc.
[01:49:30.836 --> 01:49:32.376]  And it's playing everybody.
[01:49:32.576 --> 01:49:33.837]  It's playing North Korea.
[01:49:33.957 --> 01:49:35.017]  It's playing South Korea.
[01:49:35.117 --> 01:49:37.318]  It's playing the United States of America.
[01:49:37.818 --> 01:49:43.180]  Because it has a long-time whole-of-government strategy that keeps driving toward an end.
[01:49:43.821 --> 01:49:47.422]  At this point, who knows what's coming out of Washington.
[01:49:47.482 --> 01:49:49.423]  And look, like I said, I hope it all works.
[01:49:50.782 --> 01:49:52.622]  The plan has been to sell America out.
[01:49:53.103 --> 01:49:56.123]  China's had one-sided trade deals, $900 billion a year.
[01:49:56.523 --> 01:50:00.204]  Yeah, no wonder they're building giant roads and trains everywhere, because we've been screwed over.
[01:50:00.264 --> 01:50:01.525]  That's the globalist plan.
[01:50:02.025 --> 01:50:04.085]  And then she says, just give us a central thing.
[01:50:04.125 --> 01:50:05.066]  We'd make it work better.
[01:50:05.126 --> 01:50:05.306]  No.
[01:50:05.646 --> 01:50:13.448]  People like you, the one with a centralized system, got all our investment through one-sided deals, show that thousands of rich globalists can go over there and be billionaires.
[01:50:14.108 --> 01:50:14.890]  And screw us over.
[01:50:15.271 --> 01:50:21.285]  That's why Apple moved there three months ago and gave them the keys to the kingdom, the entire code system.
[01:50:23.032 --> 01:50:27.494]  And that's why Obama gave them the Office of Personnel Management hack, was to checkmate America.
[01:50:27.714 --> 01:50:37.859]  And Trump came in to block that in our emergency hour, and we're barely hanging on, while you cheerlead for China, when the Democrat Party is on record, basically financed by the Chai Khans!
[01:50:38.279 --> 01:50:40.860]  These people are unbelievable trader filth!
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:47.823]  And the way they sneak into the room, how China's so great, and how China's so smart, because you globalists propped them up!
[01:50:48.224 --> 01:50:48.824]  You did it!
[01:50:49.164 --> 01:50:49.944]  You're the enemy!
[01:50:50.124 --> 01:50:50.865]  You're the problem!
[01:50:51.365 --> 01:50:55.806]  Well, she intentionally praises China and what they've done.
[01:50:55.846 --> 01:50:57.507]  She says the long-term arc.
[01:50:58.267 --> 01:51:01.007]  Okay, you're talking about the long-term arc of communism?
[01:51:01.027 --> 01:51:02.008]  No, that's a communist term.
[01:51:02.068 --> 01:51:03.388]  It's a bridge.
[01:51:03.668 --> 01:51:04.608]  They call it the arc.
[01:51:05.068 --> 01:51:08.249]  But notice at the top of that clip what she does.
[01:51:08.609 --> 01:51:12.890]  She mentions South Korea, North Korea, Japan, China, Mexico, all these other countries.
[01:51:13.171 --> 01:51:14.391]  She mentions America last.
[01:51:15.111 --> 01:51:20.417]  So she intentionally praises China in that clip, but she unintentionally shows where her ally really is.
[01:51:35.091 --> 01:51:42.698]  Father and husband is all lowercase, and everything else is uppercase, where he's explaining he's a globalist.
[01:51:42.738 --> 01:51:46.382]  It's just, you know, Obama's main Twitter, and it's just his profile.
[01:51:46.402 --> 01:51:46.722]  There it is.
[01:51:47.142 --> 01:51:50.205]  Dad, husband, president, citizen.
[01:51:51.266 --> 01:51:51.707]  You see that?
[01:51:51.767 --> 01:51:54.169]  Well, dad's capitalized as the first in the sentence.
[01:51:54.529 --> 01:51:55.190]  Husband's not.
[01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:57.132]  President, and then citizen.
[01:51:58.171 --> 01:51:59.932]  And you said, well, you capitalized President.
[01:51:59.952 --> 01:52:01.132]  Well, unless you're saying what president?
[01:52:01.212 --> 01:52:02.232]  Well, he's not the president.
[01:52:02.672 --> 01:52:04.513]  He is a former president, but that's nice.
[01:52:05.013 --> 01:52:10.715]  By the way, your library in Chicago is getting sued because you lied about these terms of fairness.
[01:52:10.735 --> 01:52:12.896]  By the way, 90 plus percent of his 103 million followers are fake.
[01:52:14.064 --> 01:52:15.826]  It's all fake, just like his wife.
[01:52:16.166 --> 01:52:18.289]  Okay, the next clip, Shady Hopkins.
[01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:20.732]  It was a part of this from Tucker Carlson.
[01:52:21.012 --> 01:52:22.775]  Again, this is going back to Tommy Robinson, but it's true.
[01:52:23.656 --> 01:52:31.145]  Europe and the UK are on a knife's edge because they're attempting the globalist, socialist, Islamic breaking of the back, but it's beginning to fail.
[01:52:31.165 --> 01:52:31.446]  Here it is.
[01:52:32.068 --> 01:52:34.530]  These are very dark times in the UK.
[01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:37.552]  It's a very curious feeling in this country at the moment.
[01:52:37.953 --> 01:52:40.314]  And I would say the country is on a knife edge.
[01:52:40.334 --> 01:52:47.019]  There is a real sense now that we are against our own government, that the establishment is working against us.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:54.325]  And in order to cleanse voices it doesn't like, it will put them inside for as long as it needs to to shut them up.
[01:52:54.725 --> 01:52:55.506]  That's horrifying.
[01:52:55.806 --> 01:52:56.147]  I don't know.
[01:52:56.227 --> 01:52:56.807]  I'll be honest.
[01:52:56.867 --> 01:52:59.530]  Anything really about Tommy Robinson, I don't care.
[01:52:59.550 --> 01:53:01.673]  I don't know what he believes.
[01:53:01.693 --> 01:53:02.233]  It doesn't matter.
[01:53:02.374 --> 01:53:03.855]  He was saying what he thinks in public.
[01:53:03.955 --> 01:53:05.777]  I totally take that, Tucker.
[01:53:06.098 --> 01:53:07.680]  I don't know Tommy either.
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:08.721]  I'm not a colleague of his.
[01:53:09.422 --> 01:53:10.743]  I don't work with him.
[01:53:11.324 --> 01:53:13.206]  Many people say he's an idiot.
[01:53:13.326 --> 01:53:14.467]  And in some ways, I'm sure.
[01:53:15.308 --> 01:53:19.432]  He's been told not to report at these trials and yet he's still there reporting.
[01:53:19.712 --> 01:53:22.394]  He didn't go with his lawyer or solicitor.
[01:53:22.675 --> 01:53:24.657]  You know, he knew he was going to get into trouble.
[01:53:25.077 --> 01:53:27.099]  But then... He's got guts and guts is enough.
[01:53:27.399 --> 01:53:32.604]  Even if you don't like the guy, even if you don't know the guy, there's some fundamental principles.
[01:53:32.844 --> 01:53:33.104]  Like?
[01:53:33.224 --> 01:53:33.504]  Yes.
[01:53:33.705 --> 01:53:38.289]  Where was the swift justice for the victims of the grooming gangs?
[01:53:38.329 --> 01:53:38.609]  That's right.
[01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:42.251]  Where was the swift justice for the 11-year-old that was raped?
[01:53:42.311 --> 01:53:47.794]  If we can get Tommy in prison within five hours, where was the swift justice for these men?
[01:53:47.854 --> 01:53:49.996]  And where was the swift justice for the victims?
[01:53:56.039 --> 01:54:00.281]  Katie Hopkins says that the world is on a knife's edge, the UK is on a knife's edge.
[01:54:00.582 --> 01:54:02.503]  There it is, UK journalist, UK on a knife's edge.
[01:54:02.823 --> 01:54:04.764]  Edward Tommy Robinson, arrest, dark times ahead.
[01:54:05.064 --> 01:54:05.764]  Orwellian Police State.
[01:54:05.784 --> 01:54:07.325]  And I like Katie, I think she's on the show tomorrow.
[01:54:07.585 --> 01:54:08.246]  So is Azusa.
[01:54:08.266 --> 01:54:11.848]  They're like 90% on the show tomorrow.
[01:54:12.068 --> 01:54:13.168]  He obviously just got pardoned.
[01:54:13.428 --> 01:54:14.529]  That's a whole other subject.
[01:54:15.009 --> 01:54:17.971]  This is a very, very, very, very serious time.
[01:54:18.683 --> 01:54:21.024]  Well, Tommy Robinson is brilliant.
[01:54:21.405 --> 01:54:23.506]  You know, you can say he's an idiot for getting arrested.
[01:54:23.626 --> 01:54:26.247]  Is he an idiot, or is he brilliant in his commitment?
[01:54:26.267 --> 01:54:29.249]  Those guys at License and Concord, they were idiots for not turning their guns in.
[01:54:29.269 --> 01:54:29.409]  Exactly.
[01:54:29.429 --> 01:54:29.769]  Bingo.
[01:54:29.969 --> 01:54:32.551]  Oh, Rosa Parks was an idiot for not getting out of the front seat.
[01:54:32.571 --> 01:54:33.731]  So, so that's what it is.
[01:54:33.871 --> 01:54:37.974]  It's an idiot if you want to sit there- Look at these idiots going in and demanding, you know, they'd be able to eat at a lunch counter.
[01:54:38.134 --> 01:54:40.335]  That's not- Look at this idiot demanding he'd be able to use the bathroom.
[01:54:40.655 --> 01:54:42.276]  That's not having foresight.
[01:54:42.316 --> 01:54:43.878]  That's not understanding the future.
[01:54:43.918 --> 01:54:50.463]  That's not seeing the Machiavellian 6D chess that the brilliance really is there.
[01:54:50.824 --> 01:54:51.905]  Well, I'll tell you what Trump's doing.
[01:54:51.945 --> 01:54:54.987]  It looks like 10D chess and all this 50G chess, the infinity chess.
[01:54:55.848 --> 01:54:56.749]  Time travel chess.
[01:54:57.289 --> 01:54:58.290]  He's actually a time traveler.
[01:54:58.570 --> 01:54:59.871]  He's an orangutan from the future.
[01:55:00.392 --> 01:55:05.216]  But orangutans evolve into these advanced species, and then Trump came back as the orangutan.
[01:55:05.276 --> 01:55:07.518]  That's actually in some movie, so it's real, obviously.
[01:55:08.058 --> 01:55:08.678]  Was it in the movie?
[01:55:08.899 --> 01:55:11.740]  Yeah, but did you know you can... Is it in a movie that he comes back as an orangutan?
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:14.402]  No, orangutans are like the most developed apes or whatever.
[01:55:14.422 --> 01:55:20.265]  But did you know, actually, Alex, did you know, you... I can compare... In fact, Alex Jones is an ape.
[01:55:20.685 --> 01:55:21.025]  Alright?
[01:55:21.265 --> 01:55:22.226]  Alex Jones is an ape.
[01:55:22.746 --> 01:55:24.007]  Donald Trump is an ape.
[01:55:24.787 --> 01:55:29.390]  And Barack Obama is... He was a former president.
[01:55:32.114 --> 01:55:33.755]  Look at this guy, he looks like an ape!
[01:55:35.297 --> 01:55:36.197]  He's looking like an ape!
[01:55:36.558 --> 01:55:40.080]  If I need to find an ape right now, somebody find me an orangutan!
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.161]  There's one in studio!
[01:55:41.602 --> 01:55:43.403]  There's an orangutan sitting in our studio!
[01:55:43.483 --> 01:55:47.626]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[01:55:48.027 --> 01:55:54.291]  So now, let's allow the media to make fun of Alex Jones and call Alex an ape and everything, and that's fine!
[01:55:54.812 --> 01:55:57.214]  That's fine, call him an ape, make fun of him, have your humor.
[01:55:57.935 --> 01:55:58.295]  Uh-oh.
[01:55:58.716 --> 01:56:00.838]  Rosie O'Donnell said that about Valerie Jarrett?
[01:56:01.018 --> 01:56:01.539]  Oh my gosh.
[01:56:03.321 --> 01:56:04.662]  We stopped the presses.
[01:56:05.403 --> 01:56:06.304]  What is Valerie Jarrett?
[01:56:06.424 --> 01:56:07.746]  She's from Iran?
[01:56:07.846 --> 01:56:08.807]  Wait, she might be black too?
[01:56:09.227 --> 01:56:09.848]  Oh, this is huge.
[01:56:09.888 --> 01:56:10.649]  We got Roseanne now.
[01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:11.510]  We got her.
[01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:12.471]  We got her.
[01:56:12.491 --> 01:56:13.672]  She said it about Valerie Jarrett.
[01:56:13.692 --> 01:56:14.033]  We got her.
[01:56:14.293 --> 01:56:14.693]  She's done.
[01:56:15.374 --> 01:56:16.655]  Oh, and by the way, I don't think it's fair.
[01:56:16.675 --> 01:56:17.536]  She doesn't look like an ape.
[01:56:18.368 --> 01:56:23.611]  She looks like a weird dogfish or something.
[01:56:24.312 --> 01:56:25.933]  Someone's got an undersea eel.
[01:56:26.413 --> 01:56:35.999]  Have you noticed how every article about Roseanne says, conservative Roseanne, Trump supporter Roseanne, but are the Harvey Weinstein articles about him
[01:56:36.699 --> 01:56:40.322]  Being indicted in the rape case, they don't mention about him being an Obama funder.
[01:56:40.342 --> 01:56:43.785]  Total backer and Obama in them on the child kidnapping claim.
[01:56:43.825 --> 01:56:46.006]  A god of Hollywood, a Hillary supporter.
[01:56:46.026 --> 01:56:47.328]  Oh and notice, I didn't even mention that.
[01:56:47.628 --> 01:56:48.769]  Notice that all falls happening.
[01:56:48.789 --> 01:56:49.589]  Now here's the good news.
[01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:51.851]  We have a Starbucks whistleblower coming in.
[01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:58.676]  And can you guys reprint me that article from Infowars.com confirmed George Soros literally behind Starbucks brainwashing.
[01:56:59.057 --> 01:57:00.398]  And then Matt did a special report on it.
[01:57:00.418 --> 01:57:05.402]  He printed out from the actual group financing it and running it, that's a George Soros group, it actually says
[01:57:06.423 --> 01:57:11.207]  Open Society Foundation is the main funder, so I need those before we get her on.
[01:57:11.728 --> 01:57:14.090]  But there it is, Open Society Foundation Perception Institute.
[01:57:14.410 --> 01:57:15.391]  That's coming up, but Owen!
[01:57:16.192 --> 01:57:19.194]  The big thing here is, it's all falling apart.
[01:57:19.234 --> 01:57:21.096]  Now, briefly, I didn't plug any of this out, but we need to.
[01:57:21.116 --> 01:57:28.522]  If you want to see us continue on in the face of the enemy attacks, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:40.552]  That is a huge deal, free shipping on that, because that's the biggest cost in food a lot of times, is the shipping.
[01:57:41.312 --> 01:57:42.054]  That is unbelievable.
[01:57:42.434 --> 01:57:43.997]  Plus, it's 50% off.
[01:57:44.258 --> 01:57:45.620]  That has got to end very, very soon.
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:46.401]  We're counting on you.
[01:57:46.642 --> 01:57:47.844]  Plus, your body's counting on you.

[01:57:55.424 --> 01:57:57.285]  Desiree, thanks for holding your on the air from California.
[01:57:57.305 --> 01:57:57.605]  Go ahead.
[01:57:57.725 --> 01:58:01.567]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:58:01.748 --> 01:58:06.750]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:58:07.311 --> 01:58:21.959]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your full skill that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:58:22.679 --> 01:58:25.501]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:58:26.181 --> 01:58:29.823]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[01:58:29.903 --> 01:58:36.766]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immuno wall.
[01:58:36.906 --> 01:58:41.549]  I'm just here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:58:41.969 --> 01:58:43.730]  How they're demonizing my state.
[01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:45.211]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:58:45.931 --> 01:58:47.312]  You have changed my life.
[01:58:47.412 --> 01:58:50.193]  Info Wars has changed my family's life.
[01:58:50.693 --> 01:58:56.296]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[01:58:56.356 --> 01:59:00.878]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:59:01.732 --> 01:59:03.053]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:59:03.233 --> 01:59:08.556]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:59:08.576 --> 01:59:09.916]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:59:09.936 --> 01:59:10.097]  Yeah.
[01:59:10.257 --> 01:59:12.118]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:59:12.158 --> 01:59:12.998]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:59:13.038 --> 01:59:14.719]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:59:14.739 --> 01:59:15.720]  We really appreciate you.
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:16.780]  Keep up the fight.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:18.221]  We need to take California back.
[01:59:18.241 --> 01:59:18.641]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:59:18.681 --> 01:59:19.702]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[01:59:19.762 --> 01:59:20.362]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:59:30.927 --> 01:59:31.437]  It's fun.
[01:59:57.182 --> 02:00:00.466]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:42.358 --> 02:01:04.555]  Owen Troyer is our guest under five minutes and he is going to check out for about an hour and 55 minutes and then he will be hosting the War Room three o'clock Central Standard Time and I cannot express enough the listeners and viewers on local TV stations, radio stations, the internet, you telling neighbors, friends, community, family,
[02:01:08.655 --> 02:01:13.979]  About the broadcast is just absolutely, totally and completely critical.
[02:01:14.919 --> 02:01:25.467]  And without you doing that, we are not going to be able to defeat the massive censorship, the fake lawsuits, the threats, their admissions in Reuters and the New Republic and CNN.
[02:01:25.867 --> 02:01:27.688]  We want Alex Jones shut down.
[02:01:28.949 --> 02:01:31.531]  And then CNN said, Alex Jones says nobody died at Parkland.
[02:01:31.631 --> 02:01:32.131]  Was it true?
[02:01:32.191 --> 02:01:32.872]  Total defamation.
[02:01:33.132 --> 02:01:34.153]  They're still running with that.
[02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:35.994]  They're trying to get lawsuits filed on that.
[02:01:36.074 --> 02:01:36.895]  They probably will.
[02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:40.931]  Does it matter he didn't say nobody died at Parkland?
[02:01:41.611 --> 02:01:44.232]  You're for the children, you're against the children that got shot.
[02:01:44.252 --> 02:01:51.715]  If you don't sue him, and if you don't put him in jail, or you don't, I mean, it's the level that they've gotten to of their total deception.
[02:01:52.055 --> 02:02:00.518]  That's why I just keep harping that this is the broadcast, they fear it, they want to set the precedent, and the act of sharing the articles, the videos, the links, is critical.
[02:02:00.578 --> 02:02:01.398]  Owen, can you speak to that?
[02:02:01.638 --> 02:02:04.099]  The power of how many people we run into who were told
[02:02:04.679 --> 02:02:06.460]  Person-to-person about Infowars.com.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:08.520]  Person-to-person about Newswars.com.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.021]  Person-to-person about videos and articles that changed whole lives.
[02:02:12.281 --> 02:02:13.001]  That's why they fear us.
[02:02:13.322 --> 02:02:16.743]  Well, here's why everything is being driven to the digital realm.
[02:02:16.783 --> 02:02:19.423]  Here's why everything is being driven to the digital platforms.
[02:02:19.463 --> 02:02:24.105]  Because you can monitor, you can censor, you can shut people down, you can shut people off.
[02:02:24.465 --> 02:02:31.387]  So, you know that they have the algorithms built into YouTube and Twitter and Facebook to make sure the Alex Jones Show does not get seen.
[02:02:31.727 --> 02:02:35.972]  To make sure our YouTube channel... When Joe Rogan had me on, it was the number one podcast ever.
[02:02:36.012 --> 02:02:40.437]  The message was, we're delisting the iTunes we came in to find at the top.
[02:02:40.757 --> 02:02:42.238]  We're going to delist a bunch of your other stuff.
[02:02:43.112 --> 02:02:45.794]  As a message, you have them on again, we're going to shut you down.
[02:02:46.075 --> 02:02:47.956]  And, you know, won't let it trend on YouTube.
[02:02:47.996 --> 02:02:48.997]  So how do you beat that?
[02:02:49.057 --> 02:02:51.259]  How do you beat the totalitarian left?
[02:02:51.279 --> 02:02:53.601]  It's the number one podcast he's ever had, times double.
[02:02:54.002 --> 02:02:56.464]  And so for being number one, you don't get to be on it.
[02:02:56.724 --> 02:03:01.268]  So to beat the censorship, you have to go into the physical realm and share things.
[02:03:01.288 --> 02:03:03.170]  You have to literally be in the physical realm.
[02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:07.794]  If you want to beat the digital realm, you have to operate in the physical realm.
[02:03:08.334 --> 02:03:14.223]  And that's why tomorrow you're going to be out at the number one abortuary in Central Texas, where tens of thousands of young children lose their lives every year.
[02:03:14.624 --> 02:03:16.567]  Plenty of parking, easy to get to, right on 290.
[02:03:17.969 --> 02:03:19.932]  You know what, there's a lot of liberals in Austin, Texas.
[02:03:19.972 --> 02:03:23.978]  I'd like to invite the liberals out to actually protest against death with me.
[02:03:24.258 --> 02:03:28.541]  I'd like to invite the liberals to come out and protest against the slaughter of innocent children with me.
[02:03:28.921 --> 02:03:33.284]  You know, you do the virtue signaling for the victims and the tragic events with these school shootings.
[02:03:33.605 --> 02:03:39.149]  Come out and join me at 201 East Ben White Boulevard tomorrow at the Planned Parenthood here in Austin, Texas.
[02:03:39.429 --> 02:03:44.973]  Come out and join me at 11 o'clock central and protest against the slaughter and death and murder of innocent kids.
[02:03:45.013 --> 02:03:49.816]  And by the way, if you're one of these folks that says they think blacks are under attack, well this is where most blacks die.
[02:03:49.956 --> 02:03:52.178]  52% of blacks, you know, die in these places before they're ever born.
[02:03:52.498 --> 02:03:53.500]  Come out, or you're in La Raza.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.884]  You say you're for the Hispanic race, which isn't even a race.
[02:03:56.586 --> 02:03:57.748]  I just see people.
[02:03:58.008 --> 02:04:03.518]  Well, you should come out, you know, if you say you're in La Raza or Mecha, where most Hispanics are actually dying.
[02:04:04.127 --> 02:04:07.148]  By the way, Alex, a bit of a side note, but kind of the same issue.
[02:04:07.648 --> 02:04:17.752]  Over the Memorial Day weekend, I think between Chicago, Baltimore, I forget the cities, but essentially you had hundreds of shootings, dozens of people dead.
[02:04:17.772 --> 02:04:19.052]  None of them are humanized.
[02:04:19.393 --> 02:04:20.153]  They're never on the news.
[02:04:20.193 --> 02:04:25.995]  It's only if it's a school shooting, where the left promotes it, where they're on Prozac, where they stand down, and then all gun owners are in the blank.
[02:04:26.195 --> 02:04:30.959]  But inner cities, you know, black-on-black crime, you know, that doesn't get talked about in the media.
[02:04:30.999 --> 02:04:32.700]  Nobody humanizes those victims.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:35.382]  You're going to be out there at 11 a.m.
[02:04:35.422 --> 02:04:36.022]  tomorrow.
[02:04:37.083 --> 02:04:38.984]  11 a.m., we'll be covering it live right here.
[02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:44.909]  It's only like, I don't know, we're in Central Austin, that's in South Austin, so it's about five miles from where we're at.
[02:04:45.389 --> 02:04:47.531]  So we'll be covering all of that.
[02:04:48.231 --> 02:04:50.033]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's only a couple of miles from the warehouse.
[02:04:50.053 --> 02:04:50.414]  It's almost.
[02:04:50.434 --> 02:04:53.618]  So we're going to be covering all that tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:04:53.718 --> 02:04:56.161]  Central, when the InfoWar kicks off.
[02:04:56.201 --> 02:04:57.182]  InfoWar is live on Shroyer.
[02:04:57.542 --> 02:04:58.183]  Great job, buddy.
[02:04:58.544 --> 02:04:59.565]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:59.585 --> 02:05:01.527]  An hour and 55 minutes, he goes live in the War Room.
[02:05:01.547 --> 02:05:02.629]  Stay with us with Whistleblower.
[02:05:03.402 --> 02:05:04.002]  Alpha Power.
[02:05:04.362 --> 02:05:05.182]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:05:05.382 --> 02:05:11.364]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:05:12.024 --> 02:05:15.565]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:05:16.445 --> 02:05:24.407]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:05:24.947 --> 02:05:28.308]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:32.470]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:34.251]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:05:34.611 --> 02:05:39.695]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:05:39.995 --> 02:05:48.320]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:49.761]  Nobody else does that.
[02:05:49.841 --> 02:05:52.502]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:05:52.903 --> 02:05:54.924]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:05:55.304 --> 02:05:58.386]  The second shipment is now in at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:58.666 --> 02:06:01.008]  So, you've been on YouTube for years and you don't know who I am.
[02:06:18.666 --> 02:06:25.008]  I'm primitive, I'm real, I know the enemy, and if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalists!
[02:06:25.788 --> 02:06:29.489]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:31.689]  You'll never defeat God!
[02:06:31.909 --> 02:06:33.490]  You'll never win!
[02:06:35.010 --> 02:06:37.251]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:45.232]  You guys know who he is?
[02:06:45.272 --> 02:06:48.757]  You know Alex Jones has Infowars?
[02:06:48.777 --> 02:06:49.237]  Very popular.
[02:06:49.357 --> 02:06:49.918]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:50.018 --> 02:06:50.919]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:51.019 --> 02:06:51.700]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:52.501]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:52.641 --> 02:06:53.542]  Alex Jones for Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.562 --> 02:06:53.883]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.923 --> 02:06:54.363]  From Infowars.
[02:06:54.444 --> 02:06:55.225]  Infowars.
[02:06:55.245 --> 02:06:55.745]  Yeah.
[02:06:55.785 --> 02:06:57.047]  But did that stop him?
[02:06:57.087 --> 02:06:57.147]  No!
[02:06:57.307 --> 02:06:57.928]  It did not!
[02:07:00.903 --> 02:07:02.285]  We're going, okay?
[02:07:02.425 --> 02:07:04.048]  And just, it went everywhere.
[02:07:04.128 --> 02:07:07.813]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it.
[02:07:07.833 --> 02:07:09.736]  It's like the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:07:10.016 --> 02:07:12.680]  And so that's why the joke is on you.
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:14.582]  And that's why it's gonna continue.
[02:07:25.712 --> 02:07:27.212]  I know your mustache is cool!
[02:07:27.592 --> 02:07:29.393]  You got little gold-framed glasses!
[02:07:30.673 --> 02:07:38.235]  You scare me so bad!
[02:07:38.495 --> 02:07:44.777]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:07:46.337 --> 02:07:46.737]  Now!
[02:07:48.758 --> 02:07:50.098]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:07:51.738 --> 02:07:53.820]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:55.181]  I believe in you!
[02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:56.702]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:07:56.762 --> 02:08:01.385]  One man, Everett's a woman!
[02:08:01.726 --> 02:08:03.307]  All genitals were cut off!
[02:08:03.567 --> 02:08:05.989]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:08:06.129 --> 02:08:07.350]  And we're not backing down ever!
[02:08:08.611 --> 02:08:10.392]  I want to kick these people!
[02:08:10.452 --> 02:08:10.972]  We're winning!
[02:08:11.012 --> 02:08:12.113]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:08:12.273 --> 02:08:12.734]  Can't you?
[02:08:13.014 --> 02:08:14.655]  We have broken their back!
[02:08:15.035 --> 02:08:16.196]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:08:20.039 --> 02:08:20.539]  Let's go!
[02:08:21.957 --> 02:08:22.117]  Come on!
[02:08:22.137 --> 02:08:22.377]  Come on!
[02:08:22.397 --> 02:08:22.617]  Come on!
[02:08:22.637 --> 02:08:22.837]  Come on!
[02:08:22.857 --> 02:08:23.097]  Come on!
[02:08:23.177 --> 02:08:23.437]  Come on!
[02:08:23.477 --> 02:08:23.698]  Come on!
[02:08:23.818 --> 02:08:23.958]  Come on!
[02:08:23.978 --> 02:08:24.118]  Come on!
[02:08:24.138 --> 02:08:24.338]  Come on!
[02:08:24.458 --> 02:08:24.698]  Come on!
[02:08:24.738 --> 02:08:24.918]  Come on!
[02:08:24.938 --> 02:08:25.118]  Come on!
[02:08:25.158 --> 02:08:25.438]  Come on!
[02:08:25.458 --> 02:08:25.618]  Come on!
[02:08:25.698 --> 02:08:25.838]  Come on!
[02:08:25.858 --> 02:08:25.998]  Come on!
[02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:26.298]  Come on!
[02:08:26.358 --> 02:08:26.558]  Come on!
[02:08:26.578 --> 02:08:26.859]  Come on!
[02:08:26.959 --> 02:08:27.099]  Come on!
[02:08:27.119 --> 02:08:27.319]  Come on!
[02:08:27.339 --> 02:08:27.479]  Come on!
[02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:27.639]  Come on!
[02:08:27.659 --> 02:08:27.799]  Come on!
[02:08:27.819 --> 02:08:27.959]  Come on!
[02:08:27.979 --> 02:08:28.119]  Come on!
[02:08:28.139 --> 02:08:28.279]  Come on!
[02:08:28.299 --> 02:08:28.759]  Come on!
[02:08:28.779 --> 02:08:29.079]  Come on!
[02:08:29.099 --> 02:08:29.639]  Come on!
[02:08:29.739 --> 02:08:29.959]  Come on!
[02:08:30.019 --> 02:08:30.240]  Come on!
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:30.500]  Come on!
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:31.040]  Come on!
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:31.780]  Come on!
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:32.000]  Come on!
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:32.160]  Come on!
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:32.360]  Come on!
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:32.600]  Come on!
[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:32.900]  Come on!
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:33.280]  Come on!
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:33.661]  Come on!
[02:08:33.721 --> 02:08:33.981]  Come on!
[02:08:34.001 --> 02:08:34.281]  Come on!
[02:08:34.321 --> 02:08:34.461]  Come on!
[02:08:34.681 --> 02:08:34.841]  Come on!
[02:08:34.861 --> 02:08:35.001]  Come on!
[02:08:35.021 --> 02:08:35.301]  Come on!
[02:08:35.421 --> 02:08:35.801]  Come on!
[02:08:35.821 --> 02:08:36.141]  Come on!
[02:08:36.181 --> 02:08:36.361]  Come on!
[02:08:36.421 --> 02:08:36.641]  Come on!
[02:08:36.661 --> 02:08:36.882]  Come on!
[02:08:36.902 --> 02:08:37.042]  Come on!
[02:08:37.062 --> 02:08:37.402]  Come on!
[02:08:37.422 --> 02:08:37.642]  Come on!
[02:08:37.662 --> 02:08:37.822]  Come on!
[02:08:37.862 --> 02:08:38.022]  Come on!
[02:08:38.042 --> 02:08:38.242]  Come on!
[02:08:38.262 --> 02:08:38.482]  Come on!
[02:08:38.502 --> 02:08:38.642]  Come on!
[02:08:38.662 --> 02:08:38.882]  Come on!
[02:08:38.902 --> 02:08:39.122]  Come on!
[02:08:39.162 --> 02:08:39.442]  Come on!
[02:08:39.522 --> 02:08:39.782]  Come on!
[02:08:39.822 --> 02:08:40.042]  Come on!
[02:08:40.062 --> 02:08:40.243]  Come on!
[02:08:40.283 --> 02:08:40.463]  Come on!
[02:08:40.483 --> 02:08:40.683]  Come on!
[02:08:40.703 --> 02:08:40.883]  Come on!
[02:08:40.903 --> 02:08:41.063]  Come on!
[02:08:41.143 --> 02:08:41.343]  Come on!
[02:08:41.363 --> 02:08:41.543]  Come on!
[02:08:41.563 --> 02:08:41.883]  Come on
[02:08:47.079 --> 02:08:51.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a Starbucks whistleblower.
[02:08:51.102 --> 02:08:52.203]  I'm not going to tell you her name.
[02:08:52.223 --> 02:08:55.365]  I'm going to tell you what region she's in so she won't get persecuted for it.
[02:08:56.086 --> 02:08:59.409]  But she was there last week during the day of re-education.
[02:09:00.529 --> 02:09:04.793]  We have a critical article from InfoWars.com that I'll retweet from a few days ago.
[02:09:04.813 --> 02:09:08.335]  At Real Alex Jones, people can see this for themselves and read along.
[02:09:08.976 --> 02:09:14.140]  Soros Open Society literally behind Starbucks sensitivity training.
[02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:34.604]  And here is the Perception Institute, and the main funders are Ford Foundation, Open Society Foundation, and all of these groups are funded by Soros, not just the actual head foundation he has, the Open Society Foundation.
[02:09:36.232 --> 02:09:41.013]  All these groups are the same mega-money, tax-exempt foundations that are doing this.
[02:09:41.153 --> 02:09:51.795]  And in the report that Matt put together, one of our producers, he shows mainstream news with major studies showing the sensitivity training creates more racism, more division.
[02:09:53.716 --> 02:10:01.197]  Just like the Me Too stuff, the Prairie Home Companion guy, the woman hugged him, her shirt went up, he touched her back, he was fired.
[02:10:02.498 --> 02:10:04.298]  That's not the same as Weinstein raping someone.
[02:10:05.029 --> 02:10:10.591]  People come in, they want to sit in there and do nothing and use the bathroom and not buy anything.
[02:10:11.192 --> 02:10:13.813]  You ever heard of don't solicit, don't loiter?
[02:10:14.293 --> 02:10:16.134]  But this is what it's all about.
[02:10:18.535 --> 02:10:21.836]  It's absolutely meant to break down society and cause culture war.
[02:10:21.856 --> 02:10:22.756]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:10:23.116 --> 02:10:23.797]  So joining us
[02:10:25.001 --> 02:10:26.162]  is a lady.
[02:10:26.742 --> 02:10:27.703]  What should we call you?
[02:10:27.743 --> 02:10:33.706]  Should we call you a Starbucks whistleblower or a Starbucks ex?
[02:10:33.726 --> 02:10:34.066]  Sure.
[02:10:34.406 --> 02:10:36.928]  Patriotic barista.
[02:10:37.908 --> 02:10:38.609]  Well, fantastic.
[02:10:38.649 --> 02:10:39.469]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:46.253]  I mean, describe, again, without saying where you are, how this began, what you witnessed.
[02:10:47.389 --> 02:10:49.110]  Sure, well thanks for having me.
[02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:51.732]  I'm in an area that has a pretty big city.
[02:10:51.792 --> 02:10:54.895]  We also have a place that's a little bit urban outside of the city.
[02:10:55.555 --> 02:11:00.999]  We have a mix of everybody going on and the store is, I could feel it already, there is division.
[02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:11.708]  This has not done anything good for Starbucks or for our store and it's not going to help, especially when they start expanding it to other companies because we know this is just the start.
[02:11:12.268 --> 02:11:14.409]  So, I'd like to start with Starbucks' statement.
[02:11:15.009 --> 02:11:19.351]  Learning a session on race bias and creating a welcoming environment to all.
[02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:21.011]  It sounds super great, right?
[02:11:21.371 --> 02:11:22.292]  This is their own word.
[02:11:22.472 --> 02:11:26.633]  This training was developed with guidance by national and local experts.
[02:11:27.113 --> 02:11:28.034]  They're talking experts.
[02:11:28.694 --> 02:11:29.894]  So, it sounds really good.
[02:11:29.934 --> 02:11:30.495]  We're positive.
[02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:31.195]  We're going into it.
[02:11:31.755 --> 02:11:36.497]  And then we look at the experts who are actually devising this session.
[02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:46.515]  We have Cheryl Flynn, Cheryl Eiffel, president of the director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, served on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
[02:11:47.175 --> 02:11:52.498]  We have Heather McGee, president of Demos, a left-leaning public policy organization.
[02:11:52.938 --> 02:11:53.458]  Guess what?
[02:11:53.598 --> 02:11:56.720]  She also served on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
[02:11:57.634 --> 02:12:01.356]  Brian Stevenson, lawyer, social justice activist.
[02:12:01.817 --> 02:12:06.419]  And you guessed it, he also serves on the board of the George Soros Open Society Foundation.
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:07.920]  And it doesn't just stop there.
[02:12:08.301 --> 02:12:15.545]  There are a few more names of experts who are also connected directly, like you said Alex, to George Soros and these left-leaning policies.
[02:12:16.286 --> 02:12:19.808]  Jonathan Greenblatt, Eric Holder, Alexis McGill-Johnson.
[02:12:20.388 --> 02:12:28.792]  It already sounds one-sided going into this, but I went in with a positive outlook and said maybe we can help make a welcoming environment.
[02:12:29.933 --> 02:12:31.934]  But it doesn't get much better from there.
[02:12:33.034 --> 02:12:38.837]  When we get to the videos, we have every speaker, pretty much every speaker, happens to be black.
[02:12:39.577 --> 02:12:42.399]  And it's basically virtue signal after virtue signal.
[02:12:42.679 --> 02:12:45.120]  I was shocked that they didn't even say the word white privilege.
[02:12:45.731 --> 02:12:51.477]  But let me tell you, every non-black employee, they were forced to feel white privilege in the notebook.
[02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:53.839]  And the notebook is a thing they have online.
[02:12:53.879 --> 02:12:57.283]  You can see it at starbuckschannel.com slash the third place.
[02:12:58.484 --> 02:12:59.825]  Take, for instance, page 20.
[02:13:00.586 --> 02:13:07.954]  It's the first time you, number seven, the first time you had a senior role model in your organization with a similar racial identity as your own.
[02:13:08.837 --> 02:13:14.420]  I couldn't answer it, because this makes me feel like I myself have to have white privilege.
[02:13:14.901 --> 02:13:15.761]  Well, that's what it's about.
[02:13:15.781 --> 02:13:18.403]  I mean, they've done this in communist countries and authoritarian countries.
[02:13:19.063 --> 02:13:22.065]  They pick certain groups and then make them denounce themselves.
[02:13:22.145 --> 02:13:24.987]  And the next is always forced labor and then prison.
[02:13:25.347 --> 02:13:30.090]  And this is being run by a guy that's overthrown countless countries, who was a Nazi collaborator.
[02:13:30.710 --> 02:13:34.753]  And you're realizing it's Democratic Party, globalist, race-baiting.
[02:13:35.513 --> 02:13:38.955]  Brainwashing, really re-education camp garbage you're having to go through.
[02:13:39.815 --> 02:13:48.919]  Yeah, and some of my fellow employees, I heard them saying, wow, this makes sense, or wow, I really understand, or wow, I didn't know that they felt like that.
[02:13:48.999 --> 02:13:51.200]  And I'm like, how can you fall for this?
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:55.301]  And you know, it just, it's unbelievable.
[02:13:55.922 --> 02:13:57.742]  So let's get back on track here.
[02:13:57.762 --> 02:14:01.284]  There is a video, oh goodness, this video.
[02:14:02.077 --> 02:14:02.417]  It is.
[02:14:03.038 --> 02:14:05.060]  I think it's number eight on that page.
[02:14:06.381 --> 02:14:11.006]  And it is by, I believe, a man called Nelson.
[02:14:11.366 --> 02:14:13.308]  My cat is messing with my stuff right now.
[02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:15.430]  Let me get to it.
[02:14:15.450 --> 02:14:17.192]  Do you have any questions for me while I look for them?
[02:14:17.572 --> 02:14:18.073]  No, I mean, I'm...
[02:14:19.349 --> 02:14:22.172]  Radio listeners are listening, and I'm watching them play some of the videos.
[02:14:22.672 --> 02:14:23.453]  You're doing a great job.
[02:14:23.473 --> 02:14:25.155]  You might back off your phone and sit down, but you're doing great.
[02:14:25.255 --> 02:14:29.199]  No, no, since you asked, I'm just telling you, it's a little overdriven, but other than that, you're awesome.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.301]  And so I'm just sitting back listening and watching.
[02:14:32.222 --> 02:14:34.943]  And so most white people in this country... I'm just so passionate about this.
[02:14:35.244 --> 02:14:35.644]  Sure, sure.
[02:14:35.684 --> 02:14:39.726]  Most white people in this country had no ancestors that had slaves.
[02:14:40.266 --> 02:14:42.607]  Most white people's ancestors came here after slavery.
[02:14:43.028 --> 02:14:44.829]  Only 2% had slaves previous to 1867, 1868.
[02:14:47.650 --> 02:14:52.693]  And literally you'll read all the time about Polish or Eastern European
[02:14:53.653 --> 02:15:00.035]  Immigrants being killed in different minority neighborhoods because they're white, and people think they owe reparations.
[02:15:00.115 --> 02:15:01.135]  It's total insanity.
[02:15:01.416 --> 02:15:05.057]  If my grandfather committed crimes, I'm not guilty.
[02:15:05.077 --> 02:15:06.517]  That's common sense, common law.
[02:15:06.897 --> 02:15:08.178]  So, but here's the deal.
[02:15:08.318 --> 02:15:09.858]  They don't mean well with any of this.
[02:15:10.318 --> 02:15:11.259]  We know what this is.
[02:15:11.319 --> 02:15:14.640]  This is college-level, SJW,
[02:15:16.414 --> 02:15:20.295]  Brainwashing to make everyone uncomfortable and to screw everybody over.
[02:15:20.555 --> 02:15:25.077]  I mean, the reality is, Starbucks, you walk in, you're working hard.
[02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:26.317]  I've worked behind counters before.
[02:15:26.718 --> 02:15:31.939]  You're trying to do your job, keep the machines clean, give the people their stuff, be nice to them so they're happy, move on.
[02:15:32.279 --> 02:15:36.381]  I don't look at what color you are, where you're from, even if you're a good-looking chick and I'm single.
[02:15:37.682 --> 02:15:37.982]  I'm not.
[02:15:38.162 --> 02:15:39.262]  I'm just in the mode of working.
[02:15:39.282 --> 02:15:41.023]  I'm not even going to, you know, ask you out on a date.
[02:15:41.703 --> 02:15:43.383]  And so I know what it's like to work in these places.
[02:15:43.423 --> 02:15:44.263]  I've worked in restaurants.
[02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:45.464]  I've worked behind the counter.
[02:15:45.484 --> 02:15:47.244]  I had a place that served coffee.
[02:15:47.764 --> 02:15:54.205]  And so we're going to talk with this whistleblower who's doing a great job on the other side and go through some of these videos she's got lined up for us.
[02:15:54.706 --> 02:15:55.146]  Stay with us.
[02:15:55.206 --> 02:15:56.146]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:56.666 --> 02:15:57.626]  Newswars.com.
[02:15:57.646 --> 02:15:58.766]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:58.786 --> 02:16:01.287]  The number one hated news source by globalists.
[02:16:02.461 --> 02:16:08.704]  Kim Kardashian West was at the White House this week, apparently to have a meeting with President Trump to discuss prison reform.
[02:16:08.924 --> 02:16:16.028]  The reality TV star has advocated for a pardon of a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.
[02:16:16.248 --> 02:16:22.672]  CNN's Jim Acosta lamented the Kardashian meeting, saying it wasn't a serious thing to have happen at the White House.
[02:16:22.892 --> 02:16:26.814]  It's not clear if Acosta suddenly has a problem with celebrities coming to the White House.
[02:16:26.994 --> 02:16:29.015]  It was quite routine during the Obama years.
[02:16:29.355 --> 02:16:36.943]  Rapper Meek Mill has been a longtime advocate for prison reform and he was set to speak on a panel as part of President Trump's prison reform summit.
[02:16:37.043 --> 02:16:45.872]  TMZ reported that after a late night call from Jay-Z saying meeting with Trump would be problematic for his image and for the cause, Meek bailed on that meeting.
[02:16:46.032 --> 02:16:50.236]  Meek said he remains fully committed to improving our criminal justice system.
[02:16:50.397 --> 02:16:52.599]  Clearly not enough to put politics aside.
[02:16:52.759 --> 02:16:59.909]  Kardashian has made it clear she doesn't share her husband Kanye's support for President Trump, but at least she was willing to take a meeting for the cause.
[02:17:03.223 --> 02:17:07.744]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:17:07.784 --> 02:17:08.285]  Thanks for holding.
[02:17:08.365 --> 02:17:09.285]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:17:09.705 --> 02:17:13.326]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:17:13.386 --> 02:17:26.510]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet, and I thought it was pretty cool, and read all the books, and seen all the DVDs, and followed all your guests.
[02:17:26.670 --> 02:17:30.332]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[02:17:30.412 --> 02:17:37.316]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body.
[02:17:37.336 --> 02:17:38.317]  It's all amazing.
[02:17:38.337 --> 02:17:38.877]  Thank you, brother.
[02:17:38.937 --> 02:17:47.482]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:17:47.562 --> 02:17:52.325]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:17:52.445 --> 02:17:55.287]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[02:17:55.487 --> 02:17:59.309]  You, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[02:18:06.433 --> 02:18:11.956]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:18:12.156 --> 02:18:19.780]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:23.162]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[02:20:06.421 --> 02:20:09.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.044 --> 02:20:21.591]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:20:22.072 --> 02:20:24.615]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:38.973 --> 02:20:41.734]  We may have to reschedule our guest because of sound issues.
[02:20:42.234 --> 02:20:43.934]  I want her to be crystal clear what she's saying.
[02:20:43.974 --> 02:20:44.675]  It's so important.
[02:20:44.715 --> 02:20:46.175]  But we'll finish up here.
[02:20:46.195 --> 02:20:55.157]  It's just astounding when you get into the level of brainwashing that's going on and the level of white guilt spewing by these billionaires that are pretty much tax exempt.
[02:20:55.218 --> 02:20:57.538]  This is their evacuation play.
[02:20:57.598 --> 02:21:01.399]  This is their rearguard action while they rob us to get us all fighting with each other.
[02:21:01.739 --> 02:21:03.880]  And again, this is an admitted cultural situation.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:07.481]  So they closed for a day last week to beyond virtue signal.
[02:21:08.456 --> 02:21:15.699]  Remember, they tried last year to make white patrons admit they were racist or, you know, talk about all this stuff.
[02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:20.542]  And again, all this is designed to do is to create division.
[02:21:20.762 --> 02:21:22.763]  And it's all malice-type brainwashing.
[02:21:23.223 --> 02:21:25.024]  All the iconography is very, very communist.
[02:21:25.544 --> 02:21:27.105]  Of course, directed by billionaires.
[02:21:27.864 --> 02:21:34.210]  And then coming up after she leaves us, we have Laura Loomer joining us with huge new developments.
[02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:39.254]  Turns out three women, just as we first broke, inside the hotel room with the supposed shooter.
[02:21:39.695 --> 02:21:42.157]  Islamic connections, that cover-up is unraveling.
[02:21:42.918 --> 02:21:46.261]  So again, oh they have racist rehabilitation!
[02:21:47.975 --> 02:21:51.399]  Isn't that nice when they rehabilitate you and they teach you how you're bad?
[02:21:51.419 --> 02:21:57.327]  And then I've noticed they've had some of these racist rehabilitators on the news lately, and all they do is spout how bad white people are.
[02:21:57.347 --> 02:22:04.716]  So I guess the rehabilitators are racist, and then tell you how whites are inherently bad, and then you get Stockholm Syndrome, and then tell them how bad you are.
[02:22:06.358 --> 02:22:16.506]  During this day-long situation, ma'am, we're not going to say your name, you're a Starbucks whistleblower, from the admitted rehabilitation, that means re-education camp, so you're in this thing.
[02:22:16.826 --> 02:22:18.607]  What did they do during the rehabilitation?
[02:22:18.627 --> 02:22:24.291]  Did they offer, if any of you white people are bad racists, because only whites can be racist, we've got some rehabilitation for you?
[02:22:25.772 --> 02:22:31.296]  I mean, it pretty much felt like they were pointing the finger, and what was funny was there was no other races that were involved.
[02:22:31.356 --> 02:22:33.378]  It was only black versus white.
[02:22:34.446 --> 02:22:36.528]  No Hispanic, no Asian, nothing.
[02:22:36.648 --> 02:22:38.230]  It was just black versus white.
[02:22:38.791 --> 02:22:47.800]  And then we got to this video by Stanley Nelson, which I'd like to mention, he was the director and writer of the documentary The Black Panther, Vanguard of the Revolution.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:52.265]  And of course, he was given a medal by, guess who?
[02:22:52.365 --> 02:22:53.005]  Barack Obama.
[02:22:54.096 --> 02:22:55.818]  So he had this video.
[02:22:56.039 --> 02:22:57.501]  He made this video for Starbucks.
[02:22:57.581 --> 02:22:59.303]  Specifically, it's called The Story of Access.
[02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:01.166]  You can find it right on the website.
[02:23:01.847 --> 02:23:03.589]  And we had to watch it all together.
[02:23:03.609 --> 02:23:04.531]  It was so uncomfortable.
[02:23:04.711 --> 02:23:10.980]  They showed horrible scenes from the 60s, showing discrimination against blacks in public places.
[02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:13.724]  As well as more recent events, quote, on cell phones.
[02:23:14.244 --> 02:23:18.088]  But the most damaging was the interviews they had with black Americans.
[02:23:18.528 --> 02:23:27.776]  And the common theme was that they can't leave the house without feeling judged, or like they were going to be caught stealing, or that they were going to be afraid.
[02:23:28.577 --> 02:23:35.423]  And one female even said that she wishes she could leave the house just as normal as that white guy does.
[02:23:36.377 --> 02:23:43.581]  And I just couldn't believe that they would not be able to take their lives in their own hands and say, I am not a victim.
[02:23:43.641 --> 02:23:47.503]  I'm going to go out and I'm going to live my life to the fullest and no one's going to judge me.
[02:23:47.864 --> 02:23:49.204]  Candace Owens says it perfectly.
[02:23:49.584 --> 02:23:53.146]  These victims just want to be victims and that's it.
[02:23:53.407 --> 02:23:54.307]  That's all they want.
[02:23:54.387 --> 02:23:55.488]  Oh, you just hit it on the head.
[02:23:56.786 --> 02:24:01.530]  The real victims here are the people being brainwashed that they're victims, not the white people being told they're racist.
[02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:09.176]  That's bad enough, but to just try to go work at a coffee place and not get promoted because of the good job you do, but think everyone's out to get you.
[02:24:09.196 --> 02:24:10.698]  They're teaching total mental illness.
[02:24:12.625 --> 02:24:13.225]  Completely.
[02:24:13.365 --> 02:24:29.175]  My favorite quote was from a black male in that video and he was talking about how he was so heartbroken that he would have to tell his son that he has to enter this world and this world is a muddy river of racism and he would have to walk through that muddy river of racism.
[02:24:29.875 --> 02:24:32.737]  Has nothing changed since the Civil Rights Act?
[02:24:32.837 --> 02:24:34.318]  Has nothing changed in America?
[02:24:35.179 --> 02:24:36.459]  We don't get credit for anything.
[02:24:38.641 --> 02:24:40.462]  Just makes me think that
[02:24:41.397 --> 02:24:47.660]  If a small percentage of the black Americans feel like this, this can be really critical to our future.
[02:24:48.021 --> 02:24:49.101]  They have to wake up.
[02:24:49.221 --> 02:24:50.402]  They have to be red billed.
[02:24:51.503 --> 02:24:52.143]  Well, you know what?
[02:24:52.803 --> 02:24:54.224]  We had a little bit of audio problem earlier.
[02:24:54.304 --> 02:24:59.487]  I want to get you back on for a full 30 minutes tomorrow.
[02:24:59.747 --> 02:25:02.489]  I mean, I think we should make a bigger deal about this from your perspective.
[02:25:02.509 --> 02:25:04.650]  And I think we should really cause a cascade
[02:25:05.731 --> 02:25:05.951]  That's
[02:25:22.691 --> 02:25:25.432]  Who don't like doing this, so you can be heard from.
[02:25:25.452 --> 02:25:28.872]  But really, it's the Democratic Party coming in, knowing that we're a loving country.
[02:25:29.253 --> 02:25:30.973]  We're the most open country in the world.
[02:25:31.473 --> 02:25:38.635]  The average young person's been brought up to hate themselves if they're white, if they're black, to think everybody's out to get them, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:25:39.255 --> 02:25:45.996]  And so you now just throw salt in the wounds, and then of course it's all Democratic Party run with George Soros, who's a Nazi collaborator.
[02:25:46.657 --> 02:25:48.357]  I mean, you know, what about his rehabilitation?
[02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:52.470]  I mean, it's just next level.
[02:25:53.631 --> 02:26:02.978]  And what's funny is at the end of the day of the training, we were left with, I would say, probably about 1% of strategy on how to deal with problem customers.
[02:26:03.998 --> 02:26:09.342]  Everything else was pretty much race-baiting, victim, shove-in-your-face propaganda.
[02:26:10.708 --> 02:26:11.449]  Unbelievable.
[02:26:11.969 --> 02:26:16.753]  And you can see that the pressure from Black Lives Matter is ultimately going to tank this company.
[02:26:16.813 --> 02:26:23.498]  Because now, heck, I'm going to tell everyone to come in with their chessboards, their Dunkin' Donuts, and they should just have lunch right in Starbucks.
[02:26:23.598 --> 02:26:28.181]  Because, heck, we invite every single person who walks through that store as a customer now.
[02:26:28.201 --> 02:26:29.322]  Well, here's my problem.
[02:26:30.923 --> 02:26:31.584]  Here's my problem.
[02:26:31.904 --> 02:26:37.428]  Starbucks is really strong coffee, and they're usually pretty quick and everything, and they've got some good desserts and little side dishes.
[02:26:37.948 --> 02:26:41.150]  And so around the road, it's better than a lot of fast food places with my kids.
[02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:44.172]  So I'll pull in and get them a croissant, get them milk or something.
[02:26:44.593 --> 02:26:49.516]  But I don't want to go in there now, because it's like literally walking into a re-education camp.
[02:26:49.556 --> 02:26:50.877]  It's walking into all this craziness.
[02:26:51.317 --> 02:26:57.862]  I've had white members of my crew go in and say, I hear you're giving away free drinks to prove you're not racist, and they give them a free coffee.
[02:26:58.522 --> 02:27:01.223]  You know, to my crew member that's got red hair and blue eyes.
[02:27:01.303 --> 02:27:02.463]  It's insanity.
[02:27:02.483 --> 02:27:08.905]  And it's building this idea that if you say you're being racist, you're being sexist, it's like a jack-in-the-box and money pops out of it.
[02:27:08.925 --> 02:27:09.565]  It's insane!
[02:27:09.585 --> 02:27:11.146]  Mm-hmm.
[02:27:11.706 --> 02:27:17.548]  I would say if Starbucks actually really cared about race and the problem in this country, they would stop funding Planned Parenthood.
[02:27:18.268 --> 02:27:18.608]  You know?
[02:27:18.708 --> 02:27:19.509]  But they won't do that.
[02:27:19.689 --> 02:27:20.909]  They won't say it.
[02:27:21.609 --> 02:27:25.150]  Because they are just so ruled by this left-leaning people.
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:37.583]  Well they want to dominate us, they want to control the narrative, they want to define everything to the point of saying that we can't say mother or father again in school entrance exams and everywhere else.
[02:27:37.643 --> 02:27:38.824]  I mean if that isn't a cult.
[02:27:39.184 --> 02:27:50.168]  Imagine if you read a book 20 years ago where in the future you can't say mother or father and in the future they say masculinity and femininity is a myth and in the future that you know 30% of the kids are on Prozac drugs.
[02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:51.689]  I mean they've done this.
[02:27:51.829 --> 02:27:57.271]  They have partially taken over and now they think we're trying to struggle loose of this and they're really upset.
[02:27:58.271 --> 02:27:59.452]  What do the other employees think?
[02:27:59.472 --> 02:28:00.232]  Did they buy into it?
[02:28:00.252 --> 02:28:01.252]  What percentage bought into it?
[02:28:02.373 --> 02:28:04.633]  I would have to say 90% bought into it.
[02:28:04.653 --> 02:28:16.358]  I have about maybe one other patriotic employee, and we talked and we definitely feel the same way, but everyone else was just all into it.
[02:28:16.798 --> 02:28:18.419]  Oh, I can't believe they feel that way.
[02:28:18.779 --> 02:28:21.180]  I'm going to have to act differently now because I feel so bad.
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:22.980]  They just fed into it.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.302]  By the way, when we had a voice changer on you, I apologize, go ahead.
[02:28:27.995 --> 02:28:28.536]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:28:28.556 --> 02:28:32.421]  I was just going to say, their white privilege has literally been activated.
[02:28:33.222 --> 02:28:34.143]  They've been turned on.
[02:28:35.444 --> 02:28:36.285]  Just like robots.
[02:28:36.786 --> 02:28:39.009]  And unfortunately, I think this means that
[02:28:39.933 --> 02:28:45.979]  Like companies, big big companies, corporations, we're going to have to stop spending our money.
[02:28:45.999 --> 02:28:50.203]  We're going to have to think about when we open up our wallet, who we're supporting and who they're supporting.
[02:28:50.223 --> 02:28:51.224]  That's my next question.
[02:28:51.244 --> 02:28:53.105]  Laura Loomer is coming up, but come back in a few more minutes with us.
[02:28:53.466 --> 02:29:00.392]  What do we do next as a Starbucks whistleblower from your pretty smart ideas?
[02:29:04.108 --> 02:29:09.931]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott revealed a new plan Wednesday to reduce the danger of shootings in the state's schools.
[02:29:10.211 --> 02:29:17.075]  The School and Firearms Safety Action Plan makes dozens of recommendations concerning school security as well as mental health.
[02:29:17.455 --> 02:29:26.000]  Specific proposals include increasing the number of law enforcement officers on school grounds as well as mental health evaluations for at-risk students.
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.623]  The plan also calls for increased active shooter and emergency response training for local communities.
[02:29:31.963 --> 02:29:34.545]  And several pieces of legislation are up for debate.
[02:29:34.825 --> 02:29:51.816]  One such law would allow families, school administrators, or police to petition that a potentially dangerous individual be kept from owning firearms after legal due process, while another would require that proper authorities be alerted within 48 hours of any change to a person's legal ability to own a gun.
[02:29:52.317 --> 02:29:59.501]  Abbott says his plan provides strategies that can be used before the next school year begins to keep students safe when they return to school.
[02:30:01.783 --> 02:30:01.947]  Yeah.
[02:30:03.444 --> 02:30:04.185]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:04.245 --> 02:30:13.811]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:14.411 --> 02:30:19.575]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:30:19.915 --> 02:30:22.697]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:22.917 --> 02:30:31.683]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:33.784 --> 02:30:38.567]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:30:39.087 --> 02:30:41.869]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:30:42.009 --> 02:30:52.875]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:53.395 --> 02:30:54.676]  It is amazing!
[02:30:56.077 --> 02:31:01.040]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:31:02.961 --> 02:31:09.946]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[02:31:10.367 --> 02:31:16.752]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[02:31:17.412 --> 02:31:23.237]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[02:31:24.317 --> 02:31:31.062]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[02:31:32.048 --> 02:31:33.529]  Television over phone lines.
[02:31:33.809 --> 02:31:35.970]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[02:31:36.470 --> 02:31:42.333]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[02:31:43.313 --> 02:31:47.735]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[02:31:48.315 --> 02:31:52.577]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[02:31:53.118 --> 02:31:54.358]  This is very, very exciting.
[02:31:54.458 --> 02:31:58.060]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[02:31:59.020 --> 02:32:20.209]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope, not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[02:32:20.650 --> 02:32:23.331]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[02:32:24.071 --> 02:32:27.814]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[02:32:27.834 --> 02:32:29.876]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[02:32:30.337 --> 02:32:46.131]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into Phonoscope and to also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[02:32:46.691 --> 02:32:47.032]  So again,
[02:32:47.532 --> 02:32:52.515]  For myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[02:32:53.036 --> 02:32:54.537]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[02:32:54.817 --> 02:32:56.398]  You've helped make America great again.
[02:32:57.859 --> 02:33:01.842]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:06.385 --> 02:33:08.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.553 --> 02:33:19.555]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:20.155 --> 02:33:24.358]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:30.542 --> 02:33:35.645]  When I say bombshell, I mean bombshell information is what Laura Loomer's coming up in about five minutes with.
[02:33:36.685 --> 02:33:42.829]  But the lady we have on now, we had a voice changer on her earlier, but it was kind of malfunctioning so you couldn't understand everything she was saying.
[02:33:43.290 --> 02:33:44.350]  She's very articulate.
[02:33:44.370 --> 02:33:45.371]  She's a Starbucks manager.
[02:33:45.791 --> 02:33:50.634]  She said now she doesn't even really care that they find out who she is because the website came out this week.
[02:33:51.175 --> 02:33:53.817]  They had the brainwashing and, you know, the closing last week.
[02:33:54.297 --> 02:33:58.940]  And so I wanted her to recap just what this was like, what she witnessed, and what she saw.
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:05.464]  Because when you study history, when you study authoritarianism, when you study communist countries, you know exactly what this is.
[02:34:05.504 --> 02:34:06.265]  But they even call it
[02:34:06.885 --> 02:34:08.346]  Racist rehabilitation.
[02:34:09.366 --> 02:34:13.628]  And they're making you watch videos showing white people saying we're rehabilitating your racism.
[02:34:14.328 --> 02:34:15.869]  I mean, this is so condescending.
[02:34:15.909 --> 02:34:17.390]  This is so shit.
[02:34:17.730 --> 02:34:18.890]  And you know what it's meant to do, right?
[02:34:20.131 --> 02:34:22.392]  Weak-minded people turn into leftist slaves.
[02:34:22.432 --> 02:34:23.912]  Whatever the new craze is, they follow it.
[02:34:24.573 --> 02:34:30.255]  But a good portion of white people, not a majority, not even a big minority, but a good portion become racist.
[02:34:31.456 --> 02:34:31.996]  I grew up
[02:34:34.295 --> 02:34:34.796]  We're good to go.
[02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:57.932]  Hillary's calling people baristas and they're poor and they want free stuff.
[02:34:58.132 --> 02:34:59.773]  She's calling everybody poor, scum.
[02:35:00.453 --> 02:35:02.194]  And she says, what do I do to this top professor?
[02:35:02.214 --> 02:35:04.415]  And he goes, accelerate the culture war.
[02:35:05.115 --> 02:35:06.116]  That's what this is!
[02:35:07.176 --> 02:35:17.100]  And like she was saying at the end of it, as a manager, she's sitting there watching things worse off than it was, and no training what to do when a schizophrenic comes in and starts crapping on the floor.
[02:35:17.741 --> 02:35:20.122]  No training what to do when people are in the stalls.
[02:35:20.222 --> 02:35:23.563]  Let me tell you something, working in retail, your problem isn't black people.
[02:35:25.128 --> 02:35:27.209]  Because black people usually aren't junkies.
[02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:28.189]  I've worked in retail.
[02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:31.071]  It's junkies, and they're usually white.
[02:35:31.091 --> 02:35:35.293]  Because you know what junkies do, and they usually take a big shot a lot of times.
[02:35:35.333 --> 02:35:36.794]  They throw up everywhere.
[02:35:38.634 --> 02:35:40.155]  Yes, I've worked at a gas station.
[02:35:40.255 --> 02:35:42.116]  I've worked at a coffee, you know, tea shop.
[02:35:42.977 --> 02:35:44.037]  I've worked in retail.
[02:35:44.797 --> 02:35:45.678]  And man, let me tell you.
[02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:53.715]  I worked a little hardware store, and twice opened up the back door in the morning, and there'd be homeless people in there, drunk off their butt, who crapped all over the floor.
[02:35:54.035 --> 02:35:55.416]  And guess who got to clean the crap up?
[02:35:57.418 --> 02:36:03.843]  So, anybody that's worked in retail knows, your problem isn't black people in the bathroom.
[02:36:04.923 --> 02:36:10.508]  Now, in some big inner city areas, where it's like 90% black, of course your problem's gonna be black people, because it's all black people.
[02:36:10.668 --> 02:36:12.109]  You're gonna have bad people in any area.
[02:36:13.015 --> 02:36:14.296]  Well, it's almost completely white area.
[02:36:14.516 --> 02:36:16.598]  You're going to have white criminals coming in too.
[02:36:16.878 --> 02:36:18.239]  But you're almost completely black area.
[02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:21.321]  And you say you're a Chinese shop or something.
[02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:22.602]  Yeah, those places have problems.
[02:36:22.903 --> 02:36:24.324]  The community has issues with it.
[02:36:25.104 --> 02:36:26.445]  And so, yeah, that's there.
[02:36:26.485 --> 02:36:27.206]  But Starbucks?
[02:36:28.530 --> 02:36:30.772]  Correct me if I'm wrong, and we're going to hold Laura Limmer into the next hour.
[02:36:30.792 --> 02:36:33.795]  I appreciate her holding, but we had audio problems with you, and this is so critical.
[02:36:33.915 --> 02:36:44.624]  I don't know how long you've worked in retail or worked at Starbucks, and we're not going to say where you work, even though you don't mind it, since there's no retaliation, but am I right to say your problem isn't black people in the bathrooms?
[02:36:44.644 --> 02:36:48.708]  I mean, isn't it usually just homeless people of all colors or junkies, or am I wrong?
[02:36:49.870 --> 02:36:51.792]  It is not a particular race at all.
[02:36:52.133 --> 02:36:57.239]  And what I found funny was with the incident in Philadelphia, that store has a localized problem.
[02:36:57.860 --> 02:37:00.343]  Every other store doesn't have that same problem.
[02:37:00.463 --> 02:37:04.167]  So to apply this training to every store seemed a little bit ridiculous.
[02:37:04.768 --> 02:37:05.389]  We don't have
[02:37:06.038 --> 02:37:07.798]  People loitering that much, you know?
[02:37:07.818 --> 02:37:10.619]  We don't have a high black population.
[02:37:10.759 --> 02:37:16.100]  And even if we did, when we do have people in the store who happen to be black Americans, guess what?
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.301]  They're getting great service because we are a great store.
[02:37:19.721 --> 02:37:23.322]  So that one issue with that one store has to affect every others.
[02:37:23.502 --> 02:37:24.122]  And you're right.
[02:37:24.462 --> 02:37:28.123]  This is their last little grasp of how they can control.
[02:37:28.443 --> 02:37:33.365]  They're going to pick up any of the stragglers, any of the people who could be turned, minds changed.
[02:37:33.725 --> 02:37:34.905]  They're going to turn them.
[02:37:36.223 --> 02:37:42.286]  Well I'll say this, the Starbucks where they called them on the two black guys, those guys see all the Rosa Parks movies, they want to recreate that.
[02:37:42.626 --> 02:37:46.788]  They go in, it violates the policy, they get kicked out.
[02:37:46.948 --> 02:37:47.788]  They were looking for that.
[02:37:47.828 --> 02:37:54.251]  But if I was sitting there and the store wasn't full, and two guys want to sit there for an hour, I'm not going to give them what they want.
[02:37:54.671 --> 02:37:57.292]  I'm going to say, fine, sit there and enjoy yourself.
[02:37:58.653 --> 02:37:59.873]  But again, that's just me.
[02:37:59.913 --> 02:38:01.414]  If I was a manager, I wouldn't be looking for trouble.
[02:38:01.614 --> 02:38:03.715]  But is this a nationwide incident?
[02:38:04.035 --> 02:38:05.396]  Because again, I don't know where you're at.
[02:38:06.425 --> 02:38:11.472]  I just know, doing some retail and things in Dallas, that I had problems with druggies.
[02:38:12.253 --> 02:38:20.824]  And they were mainly white kids, you know, 25 years old, that were trying to go take drugs in the bathroom.
[02:38:21.144 --> 02:38:23.107]  So I just don't even understand where all this is coming from.
[02:38:24.955 --> 02:38:26.817]  It's just their grasp at control.
[02:38:27.218 --> 02:38:33.666]  And like you said, we didn't get much training on how to deal with these people who are problems, maybe druggies or anyone in the store.
[02:38:34.146 --> 02:38:36.810]  But don't worry, because there's going to be future training.
[02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:38.572]  They said that this was only the beginning.
[02:38:39.073 --> 02:38:42.277]  So I cannot wait to see what comes of this.
[02:38:42.877 --> 02:38:44.118]  And we're talking about the future.
[02:38:44.399 --> 02:38:45.079]  What can we do?
[02:38:45.299 --> 02:38:46.421]  What can we do to change this?
[02:38:47.041 --> 02:38:49.363]  I cannot be the only patriot who works at Starbucks.
[02:38:49.503 --> 02:38:49.904]  I know it.
[02:38:50.845 --> 02:38:58.132]  Some estimates are there's up to 300,000 homeless or quasi-homeless people I saw in the LA Times last month.
[02:38:58.152 --> 02:39:00.414]  Who knows if it's true, but hundreds of thousands of people are homeless.
[02:39:01.394 --> 02:39:09.139]  Now what's Starbucks going to do when the homeless can demand to come in and use their bathrooms, their Wi-Fi, because I see homeless with laptops, you name it.
[02:39:09.459 --> 02:39:10.100]  What are they going to do?
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:11.361]  It's going to ruin Starbucks.
[02:39:11.721 --> 02:39:14.703]  I don't want to go into a Starbucks with 20 homeless people in there.
[02:39:14.763 --> 02:39:16.444]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:39:17.044 --> 02:39:19.346]  And I won't want to work there when it's like that either.
[02:39:19.366 --> 02:39:22.308]  They're going to have to hire a whole bunch of illegal immigrants.
[02:39:23.528 --> 02:39:24.229]  Let me ask you this.
[02:39:24.289 --> 02:39:25.410]  Have you had a problem
[02:39:26.471 --> 02:39:32.852]  With mentally ill people coming in, because that was the other big problem, was there was always a couple of, you know, local people who are schizophrenic or whatever.
[02:39:32.892 --> 02:39:34.212]  We don't have mental hospitals anymore.
[02:39:34.492 --> 02:39:35.973]  State hospitals, so they roam around the streets.
[02:39:36.373 --> 02:39:41.534]  I mean, did you ever have a couple... Are there a couple of mentally ill homeless people you know that are kind of an ongoing issue?
[02:39:41.754 --> 02:39:42.254]  Of course.
[02:39:42.434 --> 02:39:43.994]  Of course that happens randomly.
[02:39:44.214 --> 02:39:49.335]  And we always deal with the situation very honestly and very truthfully and in a very nice way.
[02:39:50.715 --> 02:39:51.536]  That's very sad.
[02:39:51.696 --> 02:39:53.116]  I mean, I know that when I work,
[02:39:54.426 --> 02:40:07.629]  Super embarrassing sounding, but I did work at Baskin-Robbins for six months in high school in Austin, and after I moved down here from Dallas, and it was a pretty good paying job for fast food, but man, we had a couple old homeless drunks, kind of like the end of old white hobos.
[02:40:07.649 --> 02:40:16.811]  They were kind of the classic hobo, and those guys would come in, and I would, a lot of times they didn't have any money, I'd buy them ice cream myself, so I guess that's kind of the softy in me.
[02:40:17.071 --> 02:40:20.432]  Well listen, we want to have you back to go through all this to talk about the next level of it.
[02:40:21.132 --> 02:40:22.112]  Any other points you'd like to add?
[02:40:23.975 --> 02:40:28.758]  I just want to say that maybe us patriots who work at Starbucks should open up our own Starbucks.
[02:40:28.798 --> 02:40:33.521]  Maybe call it, I don't know... Freebucks!
[02:40:33.981 --> 02:40:34.442]  Yeah, you know?
[02:40:34.922 --> 02:40:39.685]  Or maybe our training next time could be a little right-leaning instead of completely left-leaning.
[02:40:40.686 --> 02:40:41.466]  Or even in the middle.
[02:40:41.486 --> 02:40:42.687]  I would take a balance.
[02:40:43.047 --> 02:40:44.268]  Somebody in the middle.
[02:40:45.078 --> 02:40:51.843]  I don't see how anyone could listen and know that all of this training was from these left-leaning experts and think that that is fair.
[02:40:51.863 --> 02:40:55.786]  They themselves, biased training, is completely 100% biased.
[02:40:58.206 --> 02:40:59.627]  This is an agenda, though.
[02:40:59.687 --> 02:41:01.308]  Remember, they're not well-meaning at the top.
[02:41:01.788 --> 02:41:02.589]  Low-level, they are.
[02:41:02.949 --> 02:41:10.294]  This is about the new religion is being obsessed about what color you are, where you're from, or what you look like, versus the character of what you do.
[02:41:10.595 --> 02:41:13.336]  It's a 180 from Martin Luther King.
[02:41:13.977 --> 02:41:14.737]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:41:14.757 --> 02:41:16.339]  I really appreciate you having the courage to come on.
[02:41:17.379 --> 02:41:18.220]  Thank you for having me.
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:19.221]  Keep fighting that fight.
[02:41:19.421 --> 02:41:19.681]  I will.
[02:41:19.701 --> 02:41:20.301]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:20.321 --> 02:41:21.042]  We'll get her back on.
[02:41:22.203 --> 02:41:23.283]  Now, Laura Loomer's coming up.
[02:41:23.403 --> 02:41:25.365]  When I say bombshell, I mean bombshell.
[02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:30.853]  New Vegas shooting documents reveal three women found in Steven Paddock's room.
[02:41:31.273 --> 02:41:33.275]  Something we first reported, something they tried to deny.
[02:41:33.595 --> 02:41:34.957]  Laura Loomer is on fire.
[02:41:35.357 --> 02:41:36.278]  She's coming up now.
[02:41:37.605 --> 02:41:38.986]  You know we're under massive attack.
[02:41:39.026 --> 02:41:42.049]  You know the globalists are trying to shut us down right now.
[02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:49.356]  And that's why I want to encourage listeners to experience the amazing supplements for yourselves and support the broadcast.
[02:41:49.376 --> 02:41:57.863]  Whether it's DNA Force, or X2, or Brain Force, or the Real Red Pill Plus now with energy, or Silver Bullet, Little Silver, or Alpha Power, you've got to try that.
[02:41:58.224 --> 02:42:01.427]  Or Super Mel's Refillable Vitality, the cold-pressed herbs, nothing like that.
[02:42:02.307 --> 02:42:03.849]  FloraLife, our amazing probiotic.
[02:42:05.029 --> 02:42:10.671]  High-quality, swearable food, one-year, six-month, three-month supplies, 50% off everything I just mentioned.
[02:42:10.691 --> 02:42:12.092]  50% off and free shipping.
[02:42:12.112 --> 02:42:15.553]  That is a big deal on all of it, but an even bigger deal on the food.
[02:42:17.034 --> 02:42:21.876]  And when you support us and get great products at the same time, it's a win-win and it changes the world.
[02:42:21.916 --> 02:42:23.617]  And they're so angry they can't shut us down.
[02:42:23.857 --> 02:42:29.779]  They're so angry people don't listen to them when they lie about us or edit tapes or Megyn Kelly edits tapes to me on NBC and Fox.
[02:42:30.059 --> 02:42:31.120]  They don't know what to do.
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:33.681]  They're just totally beside themselves.
[02:42:34.321 --> 02:42:37.182]  They will have such a big win if they're able to shut us down.
[02:42:37.222 --> 02:42:38.843]  Well, I'm not looking for them to shut us down.
[02:42:39.163 --> 02:42:40.404]  We're going to expand.

[02:47:29.904 --> 02:47:33.793]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:40.504 --> 02:47:47.810]  Joining us a little bit in the next hour, then Lionel joins us, the top legal analyst, is Laura Loomer, really an amazing, intrepid investigative journalist.
[02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:50.232]  She also gets in there and asks the hard questions.
[02:47:50.792 --> 02:47:57.798]  And she has been off and on spending a lot of time in Las Vegas, really burrowing in.
[02:47:57.818 --> 02:48:01.761]  And so much of what broke there came from her, was corroborated by her.
[02:48:01.781 --> 02:48:05.083]  So I think it's best to just let her get into it right away.
[02:48:05.123 --> 02:48:06.444]  But remember Vegas?
[02:48:07.265 --> 02:48:08.626]  Biggest gun massacre in U.S.
[02:48:08.646 --> 02:48:12.649]  history, but suddenly it disappeared off the radar because it had Islamic connections.
[02:48:12.729 --> 02:48:21.996]  We broke that first from the hostage rescue team sources, and then Laura went there and backed it up, and many others backed up as well, and now they just hope you forget about it.
[02:48:22.256 --> 02:48:23.517]  Laura Loomer, thanks for joining us.
[02:48:24.438 --> 02:48:25.439]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:48:26.087 --> 02:48:26.988]  Well, lay this out.
[02:48:27.028 --> 02:48:30.551]  You wrote it for Dangerous.com, where it first appeared.
[02:48:30.571 --> 02:48:31.912]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[02:48:32.312 --> 02:48:36.115]  You were kind enough to let us post it, and so was the great Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:48:36.135 --> 02:48:38.878]  But roll through this amazing information.
[02:48:40.154 --> 02:48:43.117]  Right, it's also on my website, lauralumar.us, if you want to read it.
[02:48:43.137 --> 02:48:48.724]  But basically, about a week and a half ago or so, there was a document dump.
[02:48:48.864 --> 02:49:00.958]  The court in Las Vegas, the judge in Vegas, ordered the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to release documents and evidence pertaining to the Las Vegas shooting that Sheriff Lombardo and the LVMPD has been fighting to not release to the American public.
[02:49:01.298 --> 02:49:09.480]  Well, turns out, you know, I've been going through the 2,000 pages, and you have to manually read them because they made it so that you can't do optimal keyword searches on them.
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:12.940]  They kind of distorted the background of the documents with this granular background.
[02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:24.783]  And I've been finding these insane, shocking witness statements, police statements, and things that they should have told us in the immediate aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting that has been kept secret, right?
[02:49:24.843 --> 02:49:26.703]  Or were just withheld from the public to cover up
[02:49:27.084 --> 02:49:32.279]  The true motive behind the Vegas shooting, which is starting to look like terrorism more and more every single day.
[02:49:33.626 --> 02:49:41.229]  A few days ago, I released a story about how one of the documents in the dispatch logs, this is an official Las Vegas police officer document.
[02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:49.752]  It says that when they entered the room, it said that the unit was under control, room 32135, where Steven Paddock was supposedly shooting.
[02:49:50.292 --> 02:49:52.333]  And it says that there were three women in the room.
[02:49:52.353 --> 02:49:54.254]  And you can zoom in on the document.
[02:49:54.294 --> 02:49:55.414]  This isn't speculation.
[02:49:55.474 --> 02:49:56.494]  This isn't conspiracy.
[02:49:56.534 --> 02:49:58.795]  This isn't some wild accusation.
[02:49:58.875 --> 02:50:00.436]  You can look and see for yourself.
[02:50:00.916 --> 02:50:10.386]  The copy, the screenshot of the document that came out of the dispatch logs from LVMPD and you can see that they're still trying to obscure the important information.
[02:50:10.687 --> 02:50:16.453]  They have removed the identities of the women and you can see that it says three women right there for your own eyes, right?
[02:50:17.426 --> 02:50:22.247]  And then it refers to these women as number one, number two, and number three, if you go back to the document.
[02:50:22.587 --> 02:50:24.628]  They have redacted the names of the three women.
[02:50:24.688 --> 02:50:36.011]  So, obviously, Sheriff Lombardo, just like I said when I was doing exclusive reports for InfoWars back in October, Sheriff Lombardo and the FBI in Las Vegas under Agent Rouse, they lied to the American people.
[02:50:36.031 --> 02:50:41.213]  They lied to the world about Steven Paddock being alone in that room the night of October 1st.
[02:50:41.673 --> 02:50:44.174]  And they also lied about- Let me stop you right there.
[02:50:44.194 --> 02:50:45.334]  I should have been more sensational.
[02:50:45.854 --> 02:50:50.538]  Because I always just come in and we announce huge information like it's no big deal or like the weather report.
[02:50:51.119 --> 02:50:51.659]  Exactly!
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:51:01.549]  In fact, we should go back and get those press conferences where they lied, lied, lied, lied and we now know lied and contradicted themselves over and over again because that's what we're talking about here.
[02:51:02.932 --> 02:51:08.394]  Well, not only that, but if you recall, I believe I was on with Owen Schroyer the week that the shooting happened.
[02:51:08.434 --> 02:51:09.815]  Sheriff Lombardo banned me.
[02:51:10.075 --> 02:51:25.722]  He had me physically removed from the Las Vegas press conference, and then when I returned the next day to cover the next press conference, he had armed security preventing me from going inside because I exposed him as a liar, for the liar he really is, on live TV, and he was forced to then change the official timeline.
[02:51:25.982 --> 02:51:27.904]  You know, it's also very concerning about these documents.
[02:51:27.944 --> 02:51:36.310]  If you look at that same screenshot you just had up on the screen right there, you'll see that the official date is September 25th and with a checkout date of October 2nd.
[02:51:36.370 --> 02:51:53.164]  So, if you recall, the whole point of me going to the Vegas press conference was because I exclusively obtained room service receipts from sources inside Mandalay Bay that showed that Steven Paddock checked in on the 25th, not the 28th of September like Lombardo and the FBI originally told the public the first
[02:51:53.804 --> 02:51:56.285]  In the first press conference they had, the first day of the shooting.
[02:51:56.765 --> 02:52:01.966]  So, the documents not only show that Lombardo's a liar, but it vindicates me and my reporting.
[02:52:02.386 --> 02:52:04.827]  And all of these outlets called me a conspiracy theorist.
[02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:13.169]  They said that InfoWars was a conspiracy theorist site, simply because I had the balls, and no other journalist did, to confront Lombardo on live TV, right?
[02:52:13.189 --> 02:52:13.849]  And I exposed him.
[02:52:13.929 --> 02:52:17.450]  And now he's running for re-election, and he has an election coming up on the 12th.
[02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:21.731]  And who knows, maybe he won't win, because now people are starting to realize that,
[02:52:22.051 --> 02:52:22.931]  Laura Loomer was right.
[02:52:23.071 --> 02:52:23.852]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:52:23.952 --> 02:52:30.274]  All these people were right about Sheriff Lombardo being a corrupt, lying, you know, operative in Vegas.
[02:52:31.674 --> 02:52:33.675]  And again, I'm glad you've launched a website.
[02:52:33.695 --> 02:52:38.136]  I know you're really big on Twitter and places, but let's go through everywhere people can find your investigative journalism.
[02:52:39.236 --> 02:52:44.538]  We post your stories at Infowars.com periodically, but what is your website again so we can put that on screen for folks?
[02:52:45.362 --> 02:52:51.967]  My website is LauraLoomer.us and it's going to include some more features in the next week or two.
[02:52:52.027 --> 02:52:56.310]  I'm updating my website as we speak, but you can go to my website and you can see my articles.
[02:52:56.370 --> 02:53:01.194]  I break a lot of stories and Milo also covers my reporting on his website Dangerous.com.
[02:53:02.174 --> 02:53:12.978]  And today, the story was so sensational, I broke another story today about how an Uber driver told police that Steven Paddock told them that there was going to be a terrorist attack at the Mandalay Bay.
[02:53:13.058 --> 02:53:14.039]  And they covered this up.
[02:53:14.179 --> 02:53:18.180]  I mean, you can see this story and the last story, it crashed Milo's website.
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:21.061]  We're talking about Milo Yiannopoulos, who has millions of followers.
[02:53:21.121 --> 02:53:26.303]  I mean, he's sensational, one of the most well-known conservative, you know, individuals on this planet.
[02:53:26.623 --> 02:53:27.884]  And his website crashed.
[02:53:27.984 --> 02:53:28.705]  Let's be clear.
[02:53:53.425 --> 02:54:01.287]  They demonized them for us, they demonized me, they demonized you, they demonized everybody, because we're not controllable and we'll go where the truth is, no matter where it was.
[02:54:01.328 --> 02:54:11.371]  But let me tell you, I was able to see secret video out of Florida that was brought to me with lawyers and the individuals here and flying them here and everything, and I was shown video.
[02:54:13.011 --> 02:54:18.573]  And I cannot say what the video is, I will just say that it was Paddock's brother,
[02:54:20.245 --> 02:54:30.989]  And it was all the things he said that dialed in everything we knew and I can't tell you because then they decided that I couldn't use it or I, you know, I didn't have the money to pay for it, whatever.
[02:54:31.330 --> 02:54:46.816]  I'm just saying we know a lot more that people don't know, but it's come out from our sources and the FBI and then Zach and the Army that we had the two different Islamic groups there that are fighting inside
[02:54:48.297 --> 02:55:03.562]  Saudi Arabia, there was a civil war going on then, the Trump supported side has come out on top, that they were having a big convention with tens of thousands of people there, that they used going in to meet with Paddock in a gun deal, which he was a gun dealer, he'd done gun deals in the Middle East, probably fast and furious.
[02:55:04.997 --> 02:55:08.399]  To kill him and then do this terror attack as some type of message to Trump.
[02:55:08.919 --> 02:55:19.725]  But because the hostage rescue team and you and many others' exposals were really happening, they had to drop it as an anti-gun deal because you got exposed as Islamic, and that's the third rail of the liberals to cover up Islamic terror.
[02:55:19.945 --> 02:55:22.126]  From your research, Laura, how accurate is that statement?
[02:55:23.345 --> 02:55:29.133]  Well, look, there's a lot of information pertaining to this idea of the Saudis, but really my focus is on ISIS.
[02:55:29.593 --> 02:55:38.125]  And I can't reveal who my sources are, obviously, but I'm in touch with people... Well, Sheriff, what about ISIS groups from out of Saudi Arabia using the big Saudi meeting as the cover to get there?
[02:55:39.281 --> 02:55:41.722]  Well, my focus really isn't so much on that, Alex.
[02:55:41.762 --> 02:55:54.607]  My focus really is on the fact that ISIS warned that they were going to attack Las Vegas, and not only did they attack Las Vegas, but this is now being covered up, and ISIS continued to claim responsibility.
[02:55:54.667 --> 02:56:05.892]  And if you read my story that came out today that's at the top of my Twitter feed, you will see how and why the FBI is trying to cover up the fact that this was most likely an act of what's looking like Islamic terrorism.
[02:56:06.212 --> 02:56:14.581]  There's one article we're covering from a few days ago confirming they lied about all the women inside his condo, inside the apartment, inside the hotel, and then more coming out.
[02:56:15.261 --> 02:56:17.504]  We'll go to your Twitter feed and pull up the latest article.
[02:56:17.964 --> 02:56:19.686]  Give us the headline on that and then go over it.
[02:56:20.714 --> 02:56:20.914]  Right.
[02:56:21.435 --> 02:56:38.173]  So in the last article, the one that you were just referring to, actually, another piece of information that I had released was that the night of the shooting, there was a detective on dispatch in the dispatch LVMPD logs that said that Mary Lou Danley had a follower on Facebook who was tied to her daughter.
[02:56:38.613 --> 02:56:43.638]  Who was posting Islamic State propaganda and videos of ISIS beheadings in Arabic, right?
[02:56:43.678 --> 02:56:52.667]  And as you know, I and a few others, along with Shepard and Bellis of IntelliHub, we were the first to report that Mary Lou Danley deleted her Facebook page the night of the Las Vegas shooting.
[02:56:52.947 --> 02:57:02.717]  But the mainstream media, because they just want to ignore the truth, they reported the same information in January when police documents that were released by court order came out and showed it.
[02:57:03.277 --> 02:57:28.320]  People would be wise to just listen to the people like me and you and the independent media because we're months ahead of the news and, you know, this is a huge lead because, you know, if you read my article today, the Uber driver said that when she picked Steven Paddock up in the Uber and dropped him off at Mandalay Bay, he was with a woman who could possibly be Mary Lou Danley, and they were talking about how there was going to be a terrorist attack at Mandalay Bay.
[02:57:30.165 --> 02:57:31.166]  This is huge!
[02:57:31.246 --> 02:57:39.214]  You've got other witnesses on record saying, get out of here, you'll all be dead in 45 minutes, that had darker skin, women.
[02:57:39.495 --> 02:57:45.481]  They said Hispanic, but it looks like it was these Filipino women, which we know have been used consistently for cutouts of those groups.
[02:57:46.002 --> 02:57:51.627]  And then you've got this confirmed, and you've got other witnesses saying it, and now they're telling folks in Uber cars.
[02:57:52.526 --> 02:57:58.531]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:57:58.912 --> 02:58:01.514]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:58:02.114 --> 02:58:05.537]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:58:05.818 --> 02:58:10.081]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:58:10.522 --> 02:58:13.784]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:58:14.685 --> 02:58:24.908]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:58:25.668 --> 02:58:34.211]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:58:35.851 --> 02:58:44.395]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:58:57.065 --> 02:59:00.186]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:59:00.206 --> 02:59:00.727]  You're on the air.
[02:59:00.747 --> 02:59:01.287]  Thanks for holding.
[02:59:01.687 --> 02:59:02.768]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:59:03.008 --> 02:59:03.368]  Hey, brother.
[02:59:03.388 --> 02:59:03.588]  Sir.
[02:59:03.888 --> 02:59:04.248]  Good, man.
[02:59:04.288 --> 02:59:05.089]  Thank you for calling.
[02:59:05.149 --> 02:59:05.709]  Hey, hey.
[02:59:05.829 --> 02:59:10.231]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:59:10.451 --> 02:59:16.814]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Violent Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:59:16.954 --> 02:59:18.635]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[02:59:18.735 --> 02:59:25.518]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:59:26.038 --> 02:59:27.159]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:59:27.219 --> 02:59:29.660]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:31.221]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:59:31.621 --> 02:59:33.202]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:59:33.682 --> 02:59:34.403]  And exactly.
[02:59:34.423 --> 02:59:38.665]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:59:39.025 --> 02:59:39.285]  Boom!
[02:59:39.445 --> 02:59:42.267]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:59:42.327 --> 02:59:42.867]  It's amazing.
[02:59:42.907 --> 02:59:44.208]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:59:44.288 --> 02:59:47.150]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:59:55.003 --> 02:59:59.104]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.604 --> 03:00:00.964]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.144 --> 03:00:14.666]  This is our land.
[03:00:15.107 --> 03:00:20.107]  These are our people.
[03:00:21.928 --> 03:00:23.048]  The workers.
[03:00:24.298 --> 03:00:29.299]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:54.166 --> 03:00:56.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:59.288 --> 03:01:06.370]  I want to thank the great crew we got here running this operation where I'm here three, four hours a day.
[03:01:06.410 --> 03:01:07.331]  Owen Schroer's coming up.
[03:01:07.671 --> 03:01:08.291]  Lionel's coming up.
[03:01:08.351 --> 03:01:09.331]  Laura Loomer's coming up.
[03:01:09.971 --> 03:01:11.612]  And look, Infor's isn't made out of money.
[03:01:12.725 --> 03:01:19.210]  But just like I've underwritten Tommy Robinson with equipment and money, and I just asked the listeners to support him, which they've been doing.
[03:01:19.230 --> 03:01:20.911]  I want to thank you because he's doing some historic stuff.
[03:01:21.932 --> 03:01:23.133]  I've asked folks to support us.
[03:01:23.193 --> 03:01:24.955]  We've supported Laura Loomer on some of her missions.
[03:01:25.475 --> 03:01:27.537]  We've supported Project Veritas on some of their missions.
[03:01:28.217 --> 03:01:29.938]  We're talking, you know, some stand-up donations.
[03:01:29.978 --> 03:01:38.481]  I'm about to make another Laura so that she can intrepidly, she always gets paid her, go out and cover this election with the sheriff and the cover-up.
[03:01:38.941 --> 03:01:39.861]  Very, very dangerous work.
[03:01:39.881 --> 03:01:42.422]  A lot of people have been killed in surrounding this.
[03:01:43.102 --> 03:01:43.922]  I pick my battles.
[03:01:43.982 --> 03:01:46.083]  I tell you, I have not gone to Vegas because it's so dangerous.
[03:01:46.103 --> 03:01:46.963]  It's not that I'm scared of it.
[03:01:46.983 --> 03:01:49.544]  I've just got a lot of big fish to fry.
[03:01:49.564 --> 03:01:50.825]  This is one of the biggest.
[03:01:51.685 --> 03:01:53.748]  It's just that we don't need to go because Laura Loomer's going.
[03:01:53.788 --> 03:01:55.810]  So be sure and pray for her.
[03:01:56.691 --> 03:01:58.694]  And Laura, you've also got a PayPal account.
[03:01:59.395 --> 03:02:08.846]  More and more conservative libertarian nationalist folks are at the behest of listeners, not George Soros, but of their fans of what they're doing who are backing you.
[03:02:08.866 --> 03:02:09.868]  So how do folks donate to you?
[03:02:11.096 --> 03:02:13.699]  You can go to paypal.me slash Laura Loomer.
[03:02:13.779 --> 03:02:17.242]  I'm also on Patreon, but the best way to contribute is really through PayPal.
[03:02:17.823 --> 03:02:27.112]  And like you just said, I do plan on going back out to Vegas if I can secure the funding to do so, because there is an election coming up on June 12th, and Sheriff Lombardo needs to be exposed.
[03:02:27.152 --> 03:02:31.496]  And regardless of whether he wins or not, he needs to be held accountable, and he needs to be questioned.
[03:02:31.636 --> 03:02:35.240]  And the FBI in Las Vegas needs to be questioned, and people really need to start
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:38.142]  By the way, ISIS never takes credit for things they haven't done.
[03:02:52.049 --> 03:02:54.010]  And they've taken credit for this.
[03:02:54.190 --> 03:02:56.891]  They said before they were going to do it, they did it after.
[03:02:56.911 --> 03:02:58.972]  It's exactly what they said they'd do.
[03:02:59.052 --> 03:03:02.533]  It looks like they used somebody that was running them guns as a setup to get the weapons.
[03:03:03.333 --> 03:03:04.694]  It was a message to Trump as well.
[03:03:04.814 --> 03:03:09.175]  And how vindicated are we that they won't say what happened and are covering it up?
[03:03:09.516 --> 03:03:10.856]  That right there is sensational.
[03:03:11.056 --> 03:03:12.717]  But notice it's just out of the news.
[03:03:13.157 --> 03:03:14.117]  It's on InfoWars.
[03:03:14.798 --> 03:03:16.018]  It's on your site.
[03:03:17.098 --> 03:03:18.599]  It's on LauraLoomer.us.
[03:03:18.659 --> 03:03:19.719]  It's on Dangerous.com.
[03:03:19.999 --> 03:03:21.160]  But that's pretty much it.
[03:03:23.041 --> 03:03:23.781]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:03:23.981 --> 03:03:29.223]  And even though I've been sending these reports to the mainstream media, a lot of them are just kind of ignoring the information.
[03:03:29.263 --> 03:03:33.324]  So right now, the mainstream media is being complicit with this cover-up of the Las Vegas shooting.
[03:03:33.644 --> 03:03:36.185]  And it's no longer, it's not a conspiracy to say it's a cover-up.
[03:03:36.205 --> 03:03:51.310]  When you have a sheriff who knows the night of the shooting that Steven Paddock checked in on the 25th and there were three women in his room, and he intentionally tells the media and the public the very next day that Steven Paddock was alone and that he checked in three days later than the actual check-in date, that is not a conspiracy.
[03:03:51.330 --> 03:03:51.950]  That is a cover-up.
[03:03:53.933 --> 03:04:02.128]  Why do you think these women were running around 45 minutes before saying get out of here you're all gonna be dead and they match the descriptions of the women in the hotel?
[03:04:03.817 --> 03:04:05.618]  Well, that's another thing that needs to be answered.
[03:04:05.658 --> 03:04:12.563]  And these statements were also mentioned in the official documents and dispatch logs that were put out by LVMPD recently.
[03:04:12.983 --> 03:04:14.985]  And these are questions that the media should be asking.
[03:04:15.005 --> 03:04:17.947]  What I want to know is how come the names of these witnesses have been redacted?
[03:04:18.027 --> 03:04:23.350]  Why is it that they're making it so that people can't reach out to them and ask them to do their own independent investigations?
[03:04:23.470 --> 03:04:25.512]  It's like they want the victims' names to go away.
[03:04:25.552 --> 03:04:26.913]  They want the witnesses to go away.
[03:04:27.233 --> 03:04:28.974]  They just want everyone to forget about this.
[03:04:29.034 --> 03:04:30.135]  And it is so sinister.
[03:04:30.715 --> 03:04:33.038]  And obviously Lombardo doesn't want to talk about it.
[03:04:33.078 --> 03:04:37.222]  I mean, yesterday he issued a comment ban to prevent people from talking about this.
[03:04:37.382 --> 03:04:40.365]  LVMPD cannot talk about it under Sheriff Lombardo.
[03:04:40.385 --> 03:04:41.406]  They are literally banned.
[03:04:43.048 --> 03:04:44.910]  Laura Luma, amazing job.
[03:04:44.930 --> 03:04:51.937]  When we come back, I want to briefly ask you what else you've got in the fire, the other irons you've got in the fire, who you're planning to confront, you name it.
[03:04:52.038 --> 03:04:52.858]  And then, Lionel.
[03:04:53.803 --> 03:04:54.804]  He's going to be taking over.
[03:04:54.864 --> 03:04:56.787]  He's a middle-of-the-road guy, but he likes Trump.
[03:04:57.448 --> 03:05:01.212]  And he's been pointing out that there's a lot of crazy judicial stuff going on.
[03:05:01.232 --> 03:05:02.154]  I love the latest.
[03:05:03.379 --> 03:05:09.623]  Kim Kardashian West was at the White House this week, apparently to have a meeting with President Trump to discuss prison reform.
[03:05:09.843 --> 03:05:16.948]  The reality TV star has advocated for a pardon of a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.
[03:05:17.168 --> 03:05:23.572]  CNN's Jim Acosta lamented the Kardashian meeting, saying it wasn't a serious thing to have happen at the White House.
[03:05:23.592 --> 03:05:27.734]  It's not clear if Acosta suddenly has a problem with celebrities coming to the White House.
[03:05:27.915 --> 03:05:29.956]  It was quite routine during the Obama years.
[03:05:30.256 --> 03:05:37.858]  Rapper Meek Mill has been a longtime advocate for prison reform and he was set to speak on a panel as part of President Trump's prison reform summit.
[03:05:37.958 --> 03:05:46.780]  TMZ reported that after a late night call from Jay-Z saying meeting with Trump would be problematic for his image and for the cause, Meek bailed on that meeting.
[03:05:46.940 --> 03:05:51.120]  Meek said he remains fully committed to improving our criminal justice system.
[03:05:51.300 --> 03:05:53.541]  Clearly not enough to put politics aside.
[03:05:53.681 --> 03:05:58.242]  Kardashian has made it clear she doesn't share her husband Kanye's support for President Trump.
[03:05:58.422 --> 03:06:00.874]  But at least she was willing to take a meeting for the cause.
[03:06:01.054 --> 03:06:02.984]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[03:06:04.358 --> 03:06:12.581]  You know, she doesn't want any thanks, but Daria, our lead producer, she does the work of three or four people, she's so awesome, and she jumped on
[03:06:31.286 --> 03:06:42.454]  Getting Michael Rotondo here like a day after the court ruling because I really wanted to help the guy and I wanted to dress him down you know but I dress myself down routinely.
[03:06:44.756 --> 03:06:51.561]  I do things that are wrong but I'm like look we got to pay for people's sex changes in this country by the millions and pay for abortions here in Austin.
[03:06:52.001 --> 03:06:55.444]  I don't want to hear he's the worst guy in the world living with his parents when he's 30.
[03:06:57.932 --> 03:06:59.332]  Yeah, he's sucking off of them.
[03:06:59.372 --> 03:06:59.892]  It's wrong.
[03:07:00.212 --> 03:07:02.153]  But I want to find out if this guy is basically autistic.
[03:07:03.453 --> 03:07:05.814]  Uh, a little quirky.
[03:07:05.834 --> 03:07:10.615]  Maybe the term is, they used to call it autistic, what they call it.
[03:07:10.935 --> 03:07:13.975]  It's an old British term that a lot of the aristocracy has.
[03:07:15.556 --> 03:07:16.496]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[03:07:16.516 --> 03:07:21.457]  The point is, is that USA Today, big headline, something positive.
[03:07:21.477 --> 03:07:27.578]  30-year-old man finally moves out of his parents' house, thanks to Alex Jones.
[03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:32.511]  And that's good, because nobody else would even give him a dime.
[03:07:33.532 --> 03:07:36.513]  Or they'd offer him a job at a local pizza place or whatever, which is great.
[03:07:37.113 --> 03:07:39.474]  But you need that seed money to get out.
[03:07:41.315 --> 03:07:44.276]  I remember I was working a job, didn't have much money in the bank, didn't really have any credit.
[03:07:45.196 --> 03:07:46.937]  Had a credit card I'd paid off a few times.
[03:07:47.717 --> 03:07:55.020]  I was 18, my dad said, I'm going to get you your first month, and I'll pay your second month, your butt is out of the house when I was 18.
[03:07:56.857 --> 03:07:58.498]  Went and found apartments, said, you like these?
[03:07:58.518 --> 03:08:00.218]  I said, yeah, I want to live in North Austin.
[03:08:00.238 --> 03:08:00.998]  You're in South Austin.
[03:08:01.038 --> 03:08:01.719]  Boom, I was moved out.
[03:08:02.139 --> 03:08:03.079]  And it was awesome!
[03:08:03.959 --> 03:08:06.220]  And my mom didn't have to see me bringing my girlfriends in the house anymore.
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:07.080]  I was driving her crazy.
[03:08:08.160 --> 03:08:10.661]  And so that's history.
[03:08:10.921 --> 03:08:14.502]  And so with the $3,000 we gave him, I'm talking about him doing some reporting for us.
[03:08:15.703 --> 03:08:16.223]  So there it is.
[03:08:16.283 --> 03:08:20.004]  The 30-year-old man finally moves out of his parents' house thanks to Alex Jones.
[03:08:20.264 --> 03:08:21.765]  It's thanks to all you supporting us, folks.
[03:08:22.865 --> 03:08:25.566]  But because I wanted to show a story of actually giving somebody
[03:08:26.843 --> 03:08:31.446]  Not a handout where they live in government housing, but the money to get out of the nest, at least.
[03:08:31.486 --> 03:08:32.867]  And we'll see how he does.
[03:08:32.907 --> 03:08:35.349]  We'll monitor Mr. Rotondo.
[03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:43.235]  We'll probably try to get him back on the show tomorrow, but he has now moved out and is now moving in to his apartment.
[03:08:43.255 --> 03:08:47.078]  Still has a little bit of stuff to get out of his parents' house.
[03:08:49.995 --> 03:08:57.081]  Well, that's kind of a punk statement.
[03:08:57.882 --> 03:09:00.764]  I'm sure they were sick of you, but that's the type of fun stuff we can do.
[03:09:01.464 --> 03:09:05.288]  Shifting gears back to Laura Loomer, investigative journalist, Par Excellence.
[03:09:06.889 --> 03:09:09.571]  What else is on your radar screen right now?
[03:09:09.671 --> 03:09:11.773]  What else are you shining spotlights on?
[03:09:13.257 --> 03:09:20.304]  Well, you can stay tuned because one of the biggest Deep State swamp monsters is probably going to be getting loomered in the next week.
[03:09:20.845 --> 03:09:22.627]  So, you know, I've been really busy.
[03:09:22.667 --> 03:09:24.088]  I work like 20-hour workdays.
[03:09:24.108 --> 03:09:25.190]  You know, I don't really sleep.
[03:09:25.670 --> 03:09:26.951]  That's why I always look really tired.
[03:09:27.955 --> 03:09:36.905]  I don't sleep because I have so much work to do and so much to investigate and so much to do because the mainstream media doesn't do their job and they're sure as hell not confronting people who need to be held accountable.
[03:09:37.385 --> 03:09:46.776]  So, you know, not only do I have to do all the investigations by myself and the writings by myself and everything else on my own, but, you know, I have to like track down people and I have to do these kind of
[03:09:48.167 --> 03:09:58.975]  And why is it that there's only a few libertarian conservative women like you that are these powerhouses?
[03:09:59.476 --> 03:10:02.178]  The feminists and the fake left wish they had women like you.
[03:10:02.558 --> 03:10:06.702]  And then the conservatives are like, oh, Laura Limer, big deal, breaks a bunch of big stories, you know, so what?
[03:10:08.943 --> 03:10:09.264]  I don't know.
[03:10:09.304 --> 03:10:10.365]  I mean, I think that they just...
[03:10:12.742 --> 03:10:13.343]  I really don't know.
[03:10:13.403 --> 03:10:14.484]  I don't have the answer for you.
[03:10:14.524 --> 03:10:18.607]  But, you know, the conservative movement, they would have a lot more people if they would actually be willing to pay.
[03:10:18.687 --> 03:10:22.130]  I find that the left has a lot more money behind them than conservatives do.
[03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:31.759]  You have all these George Soros-type individuals who bankroll, you know, activists, they bankroll journalists, and independent media on the left is actually well-financed, but on the right, it's not.
[03:10:31.819 --> 03:10:33.661]  So I would really encourage people...
[03:10:34.603 --> 03:10:35.904]  To support independence.
[03:10:35.924 --> 03:10:49.755]  I mean, if there are wealthy people who are watching InfoWars and wealthy conservatives who just kind of want to remain low-key, you can support the independent media and really give a voice to some of the amazing independent journalists out there, like myself.
[03:10:49.795 --> 03:10:52.077]  I mean, you have so many great people working for you.
[03:10:52.197 --> 03:10:53.959]  Just imagine if we could get the funding.
[03:10:54.399 --> 03:10:59.603]  Well, that's why they want to destroy us, because they see us as a nexus point, an example of how others could build things.
[03:10:59.623 --> 03:11:00.404]  But that's exactly right.
[03:11:00.784 --> 03:11:01.685]  There are studies out.
[03:11:02.807 --> 03:11:08.149]  Where Democrats in Congress have 75 to 80 percent of the wealth.
[03:11:08.209 --> 03:11:12.250]  Now, money's not bad, but they get it all through insider deals.
[03:11:12.330 --> 03:11:17.752]  You know, Nancy Pelosi's husband got $3 billion in a government contract for biotech through a bill she passed.
[03:11:18.513 --> 03:11:20.493]  I mean, you know, this is crazy.
[03:11:21.093 --> 03:11:21.514]  You've got
[03:11:23.154 --> 03:11:26.375]  Maxine Waters' husband being bailed out by her repeatedly.
[03:11:26.696 --> 03:11:27.836]  Tens of millions of dollars.
[03:11:27.916 --> 03:11:32.918]  And this is confirmed to his bank, taxpayer money from her.
[03:11:32.938 --> 03:11:34.779]  So that's exactly it.
[03:11:34.899 --> 03:11:36.420]  The Democrats are the rich.
[03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:39.001]  They're just the ultra-cold-blooded rich.
[03:11:40.001 --> 03:11:40.421]  10 to 1!
[03:11:40.461 --> 03:11:42.182]  I mean, how many billionaires are conservative?
[03:11:42.562 --> 03:11:44.543]  You might be able to... Peter Thiel's more of a libertarian.
[03:11:45.443 --> 03:11:48.264]  And then you've got Donald Trump.
[03:11:49.604 --> 03:11:53.186]  Gary Haven's a low-level billionaire, but he's still got over a billion dollars in assets.
[03:11:53.526 --> 03:11:55.126]  You know, he funds a lot of campaigns and stuff.
[03:11:55.466 --> 03:11:56.467]  I mean, who is there?
[03:11:56.547 --> 03:11:56.987]  Who is there?
[03:11:58.479 --> 03:12:01.781]  Well, look, there's a lot of these closet Trump-supporting and conservative celebrities.
[03:12:01.821 --> 03:12:03.382]  I mean, look at Kanye West, for example.
[03:12:03.422 --> 03:12:06.584]  You have Kim Kardashian visiting with President Trump yesterday.
[03:12:06.604 --> 03:12:12.508]  I mean, these people don't need to make it public, like, who they're supporting, right?
[03:12:12.548 --> 03:12:18.832]  I mean, there are ways that they could support us and keep it secret, and there's a lot of secret conservatives out there.
[03:12:19.052 --> 03:12:26.577]  And it's not like I'm advocating for lack of transparency, but that's just how our finance system works in the U.S., especially when you contribute to politicians.
[03:12:26.937 --> 03:12:29.838]  But people contribute to politicians without disclosing their donors.
[03:12:29.878 --> 03:12:35.101]  Why can't they do it for journalists and other people just because they're scared, right?
[03:12:35.141 --> 03:12:39.864]  They're scared of all of the backlash they're going to get from other celebrities and people in their movement.
[03:12:39.884 --> 03:12:43.245]  Yeah, they're trying to protect what they've got, playing it totally safe.
[03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:47.147]  But in the endgame, playing it safe in this phase is where you're not playing it safe.
[03:12:47.527 --> 03:12:48.608]  Now it's time to be all in.
[03:12:48.668 --> 03:12:49.969]  I mean, I know some of these billionaires.
[03:12:50.669 --> 03:12:51.009]  That's right.
[03:13:13.021 --> 03:13:13.301]  I don't know.
[03:13:33.058 --> 03:13:53.512]  You know, he was a thousand feet tall, I'm a foot tall, but I have given over a million dollars to key journalists, key groups, key people over the years, whether it be Veritas, whether it be, you know, Robinson, whether it be the most money to paramilitary groups working with law enforcement in the last two years, tracking down pedophiles and giving them off the books legal funding to actually target these groups.
[03:13:53.552 --> 03:13:55.934]  It's all legal, but that's why they're really after me.
[03:13:55.974 --> 03:13:58.496]  They know I'm funding the anti-pedophile operations right now.
[03:13:59.196 --> 03:14:01.597]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I gotta do it.
[03:14:01.637 --> 03:14:02.797]  I mean, God lay it on my heart.
[03:14:03.257 --> 03:14:08.018]  And that's why I got the Globalist hat for me right now, is because behind the scenes, folks, we're hitting them, we're hitting them hard.
[03:14:08.278 --> 03:14:09.358]  Laura Loomer, great job.
[03:14:09.638 --> 03:14:10.618]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:14:10.638 --> 03:14:12.259]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[03:14:12.599 --> 03:14:12.959]  Thank you.
[03:14:12.979 --> 03:14:13.859]  You're doing an amazing job.
[03:14:14.819 --> 03:14:17.500]  Seriously, how many men aren't out there doing what she's doing?
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:19.140]  How many men are doing it?
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:19.780]  How many women?
[03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:22.561]  It's quite frankly, I don't want to say shameful.
[03:14:23.899 --> 03:14:26.180]  But a lot of people just don't feel like it's their role.
[03:14:26.861 --> 03:14:34.885]  Well, I don't think of it as my role 23 years ago, starting on national television, and now I'm the number two enemy of the globalists in media.
[03:14:35.666 --> 03:14:37.427]  I mean, I am the kicking boy.
[03:14:37.587 --> 03:14:38.307]  I am the whatever.
[03:14:38.667 --> 03:14:42.129]  And I'm glad to take that on, but I don't fear them.
[03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:44.390]  I fear failure, and I'm so mad I get tired.
[03:14:44.911 --> 03:14:46.352]  I'm so mad I get angry.
[03:14:46.452 --> 03:14:52.035]  I'm so mad that I get into these mental, not fogs, I mean, my brain's still working really good, but I just can't
[03:14:53.544 --> 03:14:54.804]  Power through and everything I want to do.
[03:14:54.844 --> 03:14:55.645]  I'm mad at myself.
[03:14:55.825 --> 03:14:57.345]  I'm not doing a good enough job.
[03:14:58.345 --> 03:15:05.327]  But if you will fund us at InfoWarsTore.com, then... I mean, listen, Candace Owens wanted to work here.
[03:15:05.807 --> 03:15:08.308]  I was still budgeting, didn't know if I had the money to run her operation.
[03:15:08.328 --> 03:15:10.168]  She went to Turning Point USA, which is great.
[03:15:10.588 --> 03:15:11.208]  I'm glad they're there.
[03:15:11.228 --> 03:15:12.569]  That's one of the only other good groups out there.
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:29.840]  And you know, I sit there and I haven't hired Loomer, even though I know she's great, because, you know, I'm like always trying to wait, like, we'll hire more crews and more live shows and more, and I'm just sitting here, if I had the money, look what we've already done, I would devastate them, you would be devastating them, we would be devastating them, so...
[03:15:30.979 --> 03:15:31.880]  I make it easy, man.
[03:15:31.900 --> 03:15:34.021]  We got the best storable food for the price out there.
[03:15:34.061 --> 03:15:35.922]  My Patriot Supply Private labeled 50% off.
[03:15:36.203 --> 03:15:38.184]  It's brand new fresh food and free shipping.
[03:15:38.224 --> 03:15:38.924]  Nobody does that.
[03:15:39.445 --> 03:15:40.165]  I've got X2.
[03:15:40.185 --> 03:15:41.446]  I got Brain Force 50% off.
[03:15:41.546 --> 03:15:42.287]  I got it all there.
[03:15:42.527 --> 03:15:45.149]  Real Red Pill Plus now with energy, DNA Force, bodies.
[03:15:45.249 --> 03:15:45.789]  It's all there.
[03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:47.770]  50% off free shipping.
[03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:56.116]  Take advantage of it and get great products you need and know you are standing in the way of the globalists and their mission to destroy free speech across this country.
[03:15:56.436 --> 03:16:00.719]  We're so close to winning, but we're in sudden death overtime and we need your support.
[03:16:02.760 --> 03:16:09.385]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[03:16:10.065 --> 03:16:11.866]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[03:16:12.447 --> 03:16:18.331]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[03:16:18.731 --> 03:16:21.353]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:16:21.633 --> 03:16:24.655]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:16:25.015 --> 03:16:30.938]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:16:31.598 --> 03:16:38.062]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:16:38.422 --> 03:16:44.328]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:16:44.788 --> 03:16:48.411]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:16:48.892 --> 03:16:57.099]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:17:03.485]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:04.779 --> 03:17:09.202]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[03:17:09.822 --> 03:17:17.927]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[03:17:18.488 --> 03:17:20.169]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[03:17:20.709 --> 03:17:27.633]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[03:17:27.673 --> 03:17:30.695]  Everything else out there is bound or it's contaminated.
[03:17:31.276 --> 03:17:32.176]  It's not absorbable.
[03:17:32.556 --> 03:17:33.117]  It's toxic.
[03:17:33.797 --> 03:17:40.185]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[03:17:40.365 --> 03:17:45.931]  And it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[03:17:46.051 --> 03:17:48.574]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[03:17:49.315 --> 03:17:57.683]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs.
[03:17:57.743 --> 03:18:01.867]  That's why the FDA is involved and that's why the DEA is involved.
[03:18:02.267 --> 03:18:06.912]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[03:18:07.552 --> 03:18:11.115]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[03:18:11.395 --> 03:18:15.298]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[03:18:15.858 --> 03:18:18.600]  So we have a run of this, a limited run.
[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:19.781]  We have a good supply right now.
[03:18:20.181 --> 03:18:21.542]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[03:18:21.982 --> 03:18:24.284]  But this may be the clincher.
[03:18:24.324 --> 03:18:27.506]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[03:18:28.567 --> 03:18:31.348]  We're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[03:18:31.808 --> 03:18:33.928]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[03:18:34.268 --> 03:18:35.648]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[03:18:36.008 --> 03:18:43.370]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:47.310]  Survival Shield X2 at mfortworksstore.com and mfortworkslife.com.
[03:18:47.690 --> 03:18:50.451]  You've got to experience what having the good halogen in your body does.
[03:18:50.911 --> 03:18:53.651]  Most folks in about three weeks go through a detoxification process.
[03:18:54.352 --> 03:18:56.272]  But what it does is for stamina and libido.
[03:18:57.192 --> 03:18:58.833]  Focus energy is really amazing.
[03:18:59.013 --> 03:19:06.017]  And if you don't have true iodine, pure iodine, you will end up having all sorts of disorders, just like water, just like oxygen.
[03:19:06.317 --> 03:19:08.439]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[03:19:08.819 --> 03:19:10.060]  It's available exclusively.
[03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:14.282]  Survival Shield X2 and then fullwarslife.com and then fullwarsstore.com.
[03:19:14.342 --> 03:19:15.623]  And I hope, like a few years ago,
[03:19:16.733 --> 03:19:16.833]  Yes.
[03:19:36.048 --> 03:19:38.829]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[03:19:39.169 --> 03:19:47.490]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[03:19:48.031 --> 03:19:52.351]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[03:19:52.792 --> 03:19:59.353]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:20:06.798 --> 03:20:24.145]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.225 --> 03:20:29.367]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:20:29.907 --> 03:20:32.228]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:20:39.617 --> 03:20:50.486]  And Lionel's taken over, but he asked me to stay here in the catbird seat in the studio so that he could talk about this MSNBC host Joy Reid faces new questions about her old blog.
[03:20:50.806 --> 03:20:55.550]  Turns out she linked to a movie I produced, Loose Change, the most downloaded film in history.
[03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:58.332]  And so the fact that she did that says she's evil.
[03:20:58.352 --> 03:21:03.996]  But Lionel, former prosecutor, syndicated talk show host, and best-selling author, has an interesting angle on this.
[03:21:04.036 --> 03:21:05.778]  So Lionel, tell me what it is.
[03:21:06.459 --> 03:21:07.279]  Well, here's the best part.
[03:21:07.479 --> 03:21:08.480]  Look, a couple of things here.
[03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:20.846]  As you know, MSDNC, as I call it, has a little bit hard record to explain as far as hiring and keeping reporters of color, women in particular.
[03:21:20.866 --> 03:21:23.647]  There's Melissa Perry Harris.
[03:21:24.067 --> 03:21:25.828]  There was Tamron Hall.
[03:21:26.228 --> 03:21:27.509]  So now we have Joy Reid.
[03:21:27.529 --> 03:21:29.650]  And of course, it was Ann Curry.
[03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:32.071]  That was the morning show with Today Show.
[03:21:32.351 --> 03:21:33.452]  But here's the best part.
[03:21:34.358 --> 03:21:43.569]  So they had her on this story where she said in a blog years ago, she said xenophobic and homophobic and islamophobic, you name the phobic, she said it.
[03:21:44.029 --> 03:21:54.181]  And using the Wayback Machine, it sounds like Phineas J. Whoopie from the cartoon days, using the Wayback Machine, she apparently had her blog hacked.
[03:21:54.461 --> 03:22:02.323]  By Time Bandits, because they indicated there, as evidenced by the Library of Congress and others, that she had made these statements in the past.
[03:22:02.443 --> 03:22:05.624]  Okay, she apologized, let it go.
[03:22:06.004 --> 03:22:11.805]  So something tells me, and I'm just guessing, that MSDNC said, you know, we got a problem with her.
[03:22:12.145 --> 03:22:22.728]  She's on with Andrea Mitchell, and if you could have seen it today, I hope you saw that piece where Andrea Mitchell, and she are talking, and Andrea Mitchell says, you know, what do you have to do to get fired?
[03:22:24.958 --> 03:22:27.339]  What must you say on social media to get fired around her?
[03:22:27.739 --> 03:22:34.243]  And you could see Joy Reid blinking like Jeremiah Denton during one of those torture videos, like, help me!
[03:22:34.483 --> 03:22:35.223]  What are you doing?
[03:22:35.323 --> 03:22:35.744]  Stop it!
[03:22:36.224 --> 03:22:37.104]  So here's the story.
[03:22:37.164 --> 03:22:39.886]  So now, Alex, they figured, now we've got her!
[03:22:40.934 --> 03:22:44.535]  She is... a truther!
[03:22:45.095 --> 03:22:47.956]  Now, nobody even... they said, a truther?
[03:22:48.516 --> 03:22:49.437]  Aha!
[03:22:49.977 --> 03:22:50.757]  A truther!
[03:22:50.877 --> 03:22:54.478]  I said, well, let me see what she's truthing about.
[03:22:55.319 --> 03:22:56.099]  Listen to this.
[03:22:56.119 --> 03:22:58.020]  And they of course mention you, as you correctly say.
[03:22:58.640 --> 03:23:02.241]  Listen to this off-the-wall tinfoil hat.
[03:23:02.261 --> 03:23:03.361]  By the way, it's aluminum foil.
[03:23:03.621 --> 03:23:04.822]  We haven't wore tin in years.
[03:23:05.222 --> 03:23:08.463]  But listen to this off-the-wall statement she makes, quote,
[03:23:09.474 --> 03:23:14.600]  Many of you have seen these blog posts circulating online and social media.
[03:23:14.921 --> 03:23:16.723]  Many of them are... Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[03:23:17.164 --> 03:23:17.444]  Pardon me.
[03:23:22.369 --> 03:23:25.770]  I found, just one second, I lost my, I cannot believe I didn't.
[03:23:25.810 --> 03:23:35.952]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[03:23:45.774 --> 03:23:46.134]  Thank you.
[03:23:46.174 --> 03:23:46.954]  You know what happened?
[03:23:47.295 --> 03:23:49.335]  I pushed the wrong button, Alex, and I went to the wrong place.
[03:23:49.355 --> 03:23:51.396]  Hey, do you know why I print everything?
[03:23:51.416 --> 03:23:52.856]  They think it's some prop.
[03:23:53.116 --> 03:23:53.436]  I do.
[03:23:53.777 --> 03:23:55.517]  I do it because the damn things disappear.
[03:23:55.557 --> 03:23:56.557]  You can't find them online.
[03:23:57.478 --> 03:23:58.778]  Okay, I apologize for that.
[03:23:58.798 --> 03:23:59.458]  You're so horrible.
[03:24:00.299 --> 03:24:01.799]  Thank you for the jeopardy thing.
[03:24:01.839 --> 03:24:03.339]  Okay, here's what she said.
[03:24:03.379 --> 03:24:06.841]  The fundamental question is, do you believe the official story of 9-11?
[03:24:08.061 --> 03:24:09.441]  This is what she wrote in her post.
[03:24:09.842 --> 03:24:11.222]  If you do, great.
[03:24:11.994 --> 03:24:16.716]  If you don't, then everything that happened after that is called into serious question.
[03:24:17.176 --> 03:24:29.040]  Even if you're agnostic, or you tend to believe that Al-Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon, and that the government had no warning such a thing could happen, it's worth taking a second look.
[03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:30.440]  That is totally reasonable.
[03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:34.301]  So they're trying to fire people for saying you have a right to investigate.
[03:24:35.202 --> 03:24:35.702]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:24:37.136 --> 03:24:39.598]  She says later on, you know, anyway, it's just a bit.
[03:24:39.858 --> 03:24:45.821]  She was also talking about how and why did World Trade Center 7, which wasn't hit by an aircraft, collapse?
[03:24:46.041 --> 03:24:49.123]  And for that matter, why did any of the World Trade Center buildings fall?
[03:24:49.483 --> 03:24:56.448]  Alex, this is the most tepid, the most entry level.
[03:24:56.468 --> 03:24:56.988]  Mousy.
[03:24:59.029 --> 03:25:01.611]  Mousy tongue, to bring that pun in there.
[03:25:01.771 --> 03:25:03.532]  But it is nothing.
[03:25:04.286 --> 03:25:13.731]  But to show you how bereft, how dislocated, how disjointed the... And let me stop from saying, it's not mainstream media.
[03:25:14.171 --> 03:25:15.452]  This is mainstream media.
[03:25:15.472 --> 03:25:20.514]  There is no... But how she merely says, well, you know, this is worth a look.
[03:25:20.554 --> 03:25:23.976]  And maybe if you looked at this, it might be... This is nothing.
[03:25:24.416 --> 03:25:33.361]  Alex, there is somewhere forged into them this patellar obeisance that they're given, I guess, this manual that says,
[03:25:34.392 --> 03:25:40.754]  Whenever you don't know what to say, try to link either conspiracy theory or truther.
[03:25:41.554 --> 03:25:45.416]  I cannot tell you the number of people I called today who said, well, you know, they've linked her to being a truther.
[03:25:45.436 --> 03:25:46.596]  I said, do you know what she said?
[03:25:47.036 --> 03:25:48.657]  No, no, they didn't.
[03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:51.598]  This is from a news organization.
[03:25:52.158 --> 03:25:53.198]  Now, let me also tell you something.
[03:25:53.238 --> 03:25:55.139]  And by the way, I've got to say something.
[03:25:56.582 --> 03:25:59.683]  Roseanne may be dying for all of our sins.
[03:26:00.164 --> 03:26:00.824]  Let me say something.
[03:26:00.924 --> 03:26:06.246]  I am not about Alex to explain or justify or to whatever what Roseanne said.
[03:26:07.227 --> 03:26:11.749]  All I'm saying is that we want her to be treated the same that everybody else is.
[03:26:11.969 --> 03:26:12.369]  That's it.
[03:26:12.849 --> 03:26:20.393]  And nobody, but nobody in this country is walking around going to work and saying, did you see what Roseanne said about Valerie Jarrett?
[03:26:20.793 --> 03:26:21.353]  I'll bet you.
[03:26:22.099 --> 03:26:23.720]  Google had more traffic than me.
[03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:24.661]  No, no, I got your point.
[03:26:24.901 --> 03:26:33.308]  By them singling that out, and then saying, oh look, they're calling black people monkeys, that was their racist interpretation of it.
[03:26:33.788 --> 03:26:46.118]  It's like somebody that sees dirtiness in everything, when it's her making a joke, they take it, magnify it, let's not be exaggerating, a billion times what it would have been, and then giving their racist interpretation exactly, like here's the deal.
[03:26:46.926 --> 03:26:49.387]  People were questioning what really happened in New Haven because there were some anomalies.
[03:26:49.667 --> 03:26:51.988]  But early on I said, probably happened, who knows, looked at it.
[03:26:52.868 --> 03:26:55.249]  Then years later I say, I believe it happened, blah, blah, blah.
[03:26:55.289 --> 03:27:00.090]  They take that as weakness and then go, Jones is currently saying nobody died.
[03:27:00.130 --> 03:27:03.672]  They send in Megyn Kelly to then try to edit a tape of me saying it.
[03:27:04.232 --> 03:27:05.632]  I don't even say that on the edited tape.
[03:27:05.652 --> 03:27:07.233]  They couldn't even edit it to make it convincing.
[03:27:07.453 --> 03:27:08.573]  People even said it was edited.
[03:27:09.154 --> 03:27:13.895]  And then now they have articles in Reuters saying, we need Peter Thiel to back shutting Alex Jones down.
[03:27:14.215 --> 03:27:15.736]  He's bullying families right now.
[03:27:16.653 --> 03:27:18.054]  We want to destroy Alex Jones.
[03:27:18.814 --> 03:27:33.701]  Reuters, you're the lawyer, is the one, this writer, this Cox guy, he's saying we want him bankrupt, we want him shut down, and then he's telling lies about me and distorting what I've said to shut me down.
[03:27:34.101 --> 03:27:37.143]  This is the definition, in my view, of the real defamation.
[03:27:38.410 --> 03:27:46.998]  Well, I want to also add, there's one particular point which nobody else was bringing up, regarding Roseanne, because I've been just fascinated by this.
[03:27:47.499 --> 03:27:52.743]  They were laughing at her about suggesting that she was tweeting under the influence of Ambien.
[03:27:53.204 --> 03:27:57.408]  Now, do you remember a while back, Representative, this is Patrick Kennedy.
[03:27:58.055 --> 03:28:07.162]  Who showed up at the White House or the Capitol, excuse me, about three in the morning in his car and went through a barrier and might have been suffering from some substance abuse problems.
[03:28:07.382 --> 03:28:09.784]  And not to mock him, but he said, you know what?
[03:28:10.104 --> 03:28:13.247]  I'm taking some Ambien and it's very, it's a hypnotic.
[03:28:14.147 --> 03:28:16.309]  And the media then said, OK, fine.
[03:28:16.809 --> 03:28:17.590]  No problem.
[03:28:18.090 --> 03:28:18.831]  Say no more.
[03:28:19.031 --> 03:28:20.192]  Why didn't you say so?
[03:28:20.856 --> 03:28:22.697]  Roseanne says the very same thing.
[03:28:23.058 --> 03:28:24.098]  It's preposterous.
[03:28:24.639 --> 03:28:32.324]  Then, when they don't understand what it was that she tweeted, which might be consistent with an ambient defense, they have nothing to do with it.
[03:28:32.544 --> 03:28:33.665]  So they pick and choose.
[03:28:33.845 --> 03:28:34.825]  They're not even consistent.
[03:28:34.845 --> 03:28:41.650]  Because they lust after control of the language and the narrative, and they just want to be in charge of who can be on air and who can have a First Amendment.
[03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:43.071]  It's a war on the First Amendment.
[03:28:43.391 --> 03:28:44.993]  Lionel, you're taking over straight ahead.

[03:28:56.426 --> 03:28:57.848]  It's an act of Americana.
[03:28:58.048 --> 03:29:00.831]  We love you all, and the war room's coming up in 30 minutes.
[03:29:02.805 --> 03:29:06.388]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.

[03:30:03.277 --> 03:30:06.440]  The President of the United States is racist.
[03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:07.881]  He's a punk.
[03:30:08.821 --> 03:30:09.582]  He's a dog.
[03:30:10.383 --> 03:30:11.083]  He's a pig.
[03:30:11.243 --> 03:30:12.805]  And he can suck my f***ing d***.
[03:30:12.965 --> 03:30:15.427]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[03:30:15.567 --> 03:30:19.930]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, d*** sucker.
[03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:21.511]  The President of the United States
[03:30:22.472 --> 03:30:25.935]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[03:30:26.035 --> 03:30:31.639]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[03:30:31.699 --> 03:30:35.361]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[03:30:37.263 --> 03:30:38.403]  This is CNN.
[03:30:43.991 --> 03:30:44.331]  Now!
[03:30:44.411 --> 03:30:47.052]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:31:08.283 --> 03:31:10.363]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:31:10.643 --> 03:31:11.704]  I believe in you!
[03:31:12.144 --> 03:31:13.264]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:31:15.024 --> 03:31:17.925]  One man ever raped a woman!
[03:31:18.265 --> 03:31:19.865]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:31:20.105 --> 03:31:22.525]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:31:22.665 --> 03:31:23.886]  And we're not backing down ever!
[03:31:25.806 --> 03:31:26.926]  I want to kick these people!
[03:31:27.006 --> 03:31:27.506]  We're winning!
[03:31:27.566 --> 03:31:28.646]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:31:28.807 --> 03:31:29.287]  Can't you?
[03:31:29.567 --> 03:31:31.187]  We have broken their back!
[03:31:31.567 --> 03:31:32.727]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:31:36.568 --> 03:31:37.148]  Let's go!

[03:32:06.395 --> 03:32:07.716]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:32:08.196 --> 03:32:19.747]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:32:20.428 --> 03:32:25.533]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[03:32:25.913 --> 03:32:29.315]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:32:29.335 --> 03:32:35.598]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:32:35.818 --> 03:32:40.461]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:32:40.981 --> 03:32:43.282]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:32:43.622 --> 03:32:44.963]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:32:45.363 --> 03:32:50.246]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[03:32:50.486 --> 03:32:54.969]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:32:55.069 --> 03:32:57.231]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:32:57.751 --> 03:33:02.654]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:33:06.277 --> 03:33:16.223]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.323 --> 03:33:17.204]  Lionel's coming up live.
[03:33:18.968 --> 03:33:22.949]  So, you've been on YouTube for years and you don't know who I am.
[03:33:25.170 --> 03:33:35.673]  I'm primitive, I'm real, I know the enemy, and if we can have the spirit of normal humanity spread, it's over for the globalists!
[03:33:36.433 --> 03:33:40.035]  You'll never, never defeat the human spirit!
[03:33:40.255 --> 03:33:42.335]  You'll never defeat God!
[03:33:42.575 --> 03:33:43.996]  You'll never win!
[03:33:45.708 --> 03:33:47.770]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[03:33:47.790 --> 03:33:54.937]  You guys know who he is?
[03:33:54.997 --> 03:33:56.298]  You know Alex Jones has InfoWars?
[03:33:57.399 --> 03:33:58.540]  Very popular.
[03:33:58.560 --> 03:33:58.941]  Alex Jones.
[03:33:59.061 --> 03:33:59.902]  Alex Jones.
[03:34:00.022 --> 03:34:00.602]  Alex Jones.
[03:34:00.682 --> 03:34:01.563]  Alex Jones.
[03:34:01.583 --> 03:34:03.165]  Alex Jones for Alex Jones.
[03:34:03.285 --> 03:34:04.226]  Alex Jones.
[03:34:04.286 --> 03:34:05.207]  From InfoWars.
[03:34:05.267 --> 03:34:05.867]  From InfoWars.
[03:34:05.887 --> 03:34:06.408]  Yeah.
[03:34:06.428 --> 03:34:08.050]  But did that stop him?
[03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.350]  No!
[03:34:08.410 --> 03:34:09.751]  He did not!
[03:34:10.812 --> 03:34:12.633]  It kept going, okay?
[03:34:13.113 --> 03:34:14.693]  And just, it went everywhere.
[03:34:14.773 --> 03:34:18.455]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it.
[03:34:18.475 --> 03:34:20.415]  It's like the Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:34:20.655 --> 03:34:23.336]  And so that's why the joke is on you.
[03:34:23.856 --> 03:34:25.237]  And that's why it's gonna continue.
[03:34:36.377 --> 03:34:37.860]  I know your mustache is gold!
[03:34:38.261 --> 03:34:40.045]  You got little gold-framed glasses!
[03:34:40.426 --> 03:34:41.789]  You scare me so bad!
[03:34:49.155 --> 03:34:55.417]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:34:57.037 --> 03:35:09.861]  And Lionel from New York City, you know, he brought up this fake Russian death and all this, but I forgot, the Russians just put out a detailed report showing specific State Department, this came out last night, and U.S.
[03:35:09.901 --> 03:35:11.081]  foundations have spent
[03:35:11.991 --> 03:35:14.693]  They were listing $10 billion the last eight years.
[03:35:14.813 --> 03:35:16.174]  Well, you count Ukraine.
[03:35:16.334 --> 03:35:20.617]  They had a CNN special with Soros with Fareed Zarkaria saying they spent $5 billion.
[03:35:21.017 --> 03:35:29.502]  And then, don't believe Soros, you've got, uh, was it Susan Rice or Powers in his press conference saying $5 billion?
[03:35:29.522 --> 03:35:32.404]  The point is, we can pull that report up because I couldn't find it in my stack.
[03:35:32.424 --> 03:35:33.345]  I'm going to leave the show with it.
[03:35:33.365 --> 03:35:35.146]  I'm not a Russophile.
[03:35:36.247 --> 03:35:37.147]  I'm just a truthophile.
[03:35:39.414 --> 03:35:43.096]  You've got the West saying they're trying to overthrow the elections in Russia.
[03:35:43.716 --> 03:35:50.940]  You've got the West trying to do the same George Soros social engineering, his Open Foundation, Open Society groups there.
[03:35:51.580 --> 03:35:52.121]  It's crazy.
[03:35:53.662 --> 03:35:59.965]  Yeah, there's a report today, May 31st, funding NGOs and stirring dissent.
[03:36:00.025 --> 03:36:03.066]  Russia's special commission exposes election meddling by US.
[03:36:03.086 --> 03:36:03.667]  And here's the thing.
[03:36:04.884 --> 03:36:05.925]  It's open and shut.
[03:36:06.445 --> 03:36:07.726]  Reprint that, I can't find it, thanks.
[03:36:07.846 --> 03:36:08.426]  It's open and shut.
[03:36:08.466 --> 03:36:10.247]  I read it this morning at like 5am when I woke up.
[03:36:10.267 --> 03:36:11.648]  I was going to lead the show with it.
[03:36:12.088 --> 03:36:13.629]  Because the US admits it.
[03:36:13.669 --> 03:36:14.389]  But I want to be clear.
[03:36:14.509 --> 03:36:15.470]  I'm red, white, and blue.
[03:36:15.990 --> 03:36:18.031]  Trump has done energy deals that have savaged Russia.
[03:36:18.051 --> 03:36:18.832]  Sorry, it's competition.
[03:36:19.192 --> 03:36:20.292]  Trump's done all sorts of stuff.
[03:36:20.312 --> 03:36:21.033]  He's not a Russophile.
[03:36:21.653 --> 03:36:22.734]  But he's not anti-Russia.
[03:36:23.154 --> 03:36:42.002]  But the deal is, here, is that in the article, and I already knew all this because I read the news, our government, that's run by the globalists, the same ones that are demonizing America, demonizing Trump and me and everybody else, they're the globalists that have hijacked the country, but it's globalists through America that have hijacked Russia, and then the Russians link all the admissions
[03:36:42.642 --> 03:36:43.363]  Where U.S.
[03:36:43.443 --> 03:36:46.406]  officials are saying, we're trying to overthrow Russia.
[03:36:46.766 --> 03:36:48.688]  We're trying to put oligarchs back in.
[03:36:49.029 --> 03:36:50.630]  So, it's open and shut.
[03:36:50.670 --> 03:37:00.681]  And that's what's so crazy is, the Russians have incredible land, a lot of great weapons, some good science, but their problem is that they're five to four times geographically the size of the U.S.
[03:37:02.343 --> 03:37:04.405]  They don't give us the red lights to work nationwide.
[03:37:04.625 --> 03:37:05.646]  They're not trying to run us.
[03:37:05.926 --> 03:37:08.108]  It's the chi-coms that are running everything.
[03:37:08.128 --> 03:37:10.210]  And I'm not against... The media goes, oh, you're against Asians.
[03:37:10.450 --> 03:37:11.851]  My sister's Korean-adopted.
[03:37:11.891 --> 03:37:12.391]  I don't want to hear it.
[03:37:12.411 --> 03:37:13.092]  I love Asians.
[03:37:13.552 --> 03:37:14.313]  I hate communists.
[03:37:14.373 --> 03:37:15.394]  So, yeah, here it is.
[03:37:15.414 --> 03:37:16.154]  The article's big.
[03:37:16.474 --> 03:37:22.939]  And what's crazy, Lionel, is it goes through the State Department and the CIA and the NGOs admitting that they're tax-free.
[03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:26.762]  Point is to topple the Russian leadership.
[03:37:26.882 --> 03:37:36.510]  I mean, that takes some huevos rancheros to be trying to overthrow Russia while you then point at American dyed-in-the-wool, flaming American firsters.
[03:37:37.489 --> 03:37:42.253]  You know, most of our families were fighting the Russians in the Cold War, and by the way, kicking the living hell out of them.
[03:37:42.954 --> 03:37:47.799]  I mean, if you know what went on in Germany and everything, we were just massacring Germans, Russians, everything.
[03:37:48.159 --> 03:37:49.921]  I mean, everybody feared the U.S.
[03:37:50.221 --> 03:37:56.947]  And then the idea that those of us that are American firsters are now Russian agents, this whole thing, the wheels are coming off.
[03:37:56.967 --> 03:38:01.271]  So, A, this new big report, which is their own admissions, and B, where does it go from there, Lionel?
[03:38:01.291 --> 03:38:01.832]  Then I'm out of here.
[03:38:02.032 --> 03:38:02.532]  I'm listening to you.
[03:38:02.572 --> 03:38:02.893]  I'm done.
[03:38:02.913 --> 03:38:03.213]  Take over.
[03:38:03.453 --> 03:38:05.174]  Well, you realize, you know what you're doing, right?
[03:38:05.355 --> 03:38:16.023]  I hate to say this and I love my country and my brethren, but when you're talking about Russia, you might as well be talking about particle physics because most people have the level and the depths of their understanding.
[03:38:16.123 --> 03:38:18.025]  It goes back to Boris and Natasha.
[03:38:18.405 --> 03:38:24.710]  I mean, this is like, you know, or I will bury you, Drago, and this weird kind of stuff.
[03:38:25.031 --> 03:38:26.132]  Let me give you, this is my favorite.
[03:38:26.152 --> 03:38:27.433]  You know, Alex, I'm a
[03:38:28.604 --> 03:38:34.448]  Prosecutor cut my teeth and I know that I've been through I did mass unit prosecuting.
[03:38:34.868 --> 03:38:41.833]  And I'm telling you, when you look at a case, especially a murder case or attempted murder, a lot of it just makes sense.
[03:38:41.893 --> 03:38:45.535]  And boy, when it makes sense, it's unmistakable.
[03:38:45.856 --> 03:38:50.199]  But when something doesn't make sense to you, you pay attention.
[03:38:50.419 --> 03:38:55.162]  And I always ask this question and I always ask people, I said, do you think you think that
[03:38:56.308 --> 03:38:57.748]  Vladimir Putin's a smart guy.
[03:38:57.868 --> 03:38:58.769]  And people say, yes.
[03:38:58.929 --> 03:38:59.909]  And you always lead them into it.
[03:39:00.009 --> 03:39:00.309]  OK.
[03:39:00.929 --> 03:39:02.009]  Now let me just think about this.
[03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:19.454]  Imagine that right before his election, right before his election, when everybody's watching him, and before the FIFA Cup and everything, he decides to take somebody who was removed from prison during a prisoner exchange that he pardoned, that was in Russian prison, Skripal.
[03:39:19.814 --> 03:39:20.574]  Could have killed him.
[03:39:21.323 --> 03:39:24.826]  A million ways to Sunday in a variety in a Russian prison.
[03:39:25.066 --> 03:39:26.508]  Nobody would have even questioned it.
[03:39:26.628 --> 03:39:28.369]  But no, no, not him.
[03:39:28.810 --> 03:39:32.213]  So he lets him go and then says, I've got an idea.
[03:39:32.233 --> 03:39:35.035]  I'm sure he called his higher up and says, OK, guys, hear me out.
[03:39:35.796 --> 03:39:39.079]  You know, that guy that we, you know, the prisoner exchange, yet the one that we pardoned.
[03:39:39.099 --> 03:39:39.279]  Yeah.
[03:39:39.539 --> 03:39:41.021]  The one that really don't care anymore about.
[03:39:41.061 --> 03:39:41.201]  Yeah.
[03:39:41.381 --> 03:39:42.402]  The one, by the way, who OK.
[03:39:43.143 --> 03:39:51.568]  We're going to use the most dilute form of, quote, chemical weaponry there is, and we're going to kill him in the UK right before my election.
[03:39:51.788 --> 03:39:52.268]  What do you think?
[03:39:52.588 --> 03:39:53.509]  And they're saying, what?
[03:39:53.849 --> 03:39:58.312]  I mean, it makes... And now it turns out, first it was him and the daughter died, now they won't say?
[03:39:58.572 --> 03:40:00.053]  What's the... I mean, this whole thing's a hoax.
[03:40:01.513 --> 03:40:03.374]  Well, oh, but you can't say that.
[03:40:03.635 --> 03:40:06.296]  Oh, and what he said was... No, but it's like the chemical weapon attack.
[03:40:06.756 --> 03:40:09.438]  Turned out this last one that almost got us to war didn't even happen.
[03:40:10.239 --> 03:40:10.579]  Right!
[03:40:10.879 --> 03:40:23.727]  Now think about this, and you talk about, and these people have the unmitigated audacity, the elephantine huevos, the gran cojones, to say that this, that you and others are into fake news.
[03:40:24.067 --> 03:40:29.871]  We have a guy who was dead, who's, who's, who, this is, this, Alex.
[03:40:30.111 --> 03:40:33.793]  Yeah, say it up front, they claimed he was dead, now they say he's alive, and it's not even a news item.
[03:40:34.639 --> 03:40:34.879]  Right!
[03:40:35.039 --> 03:40:36.381]  They don't even, they don't even blink!
[03:40:36.401 --> 03:40:38.603]  For people that just tuned in, we're going to put this in the front of the interview.
[03:40:38.623 --> 03:40:40.144]  Explain what's happened.
[03:40:40.364 --> 03:40:41.485]  This guy's Lazarus.
[03:40:41.585 --> 03:40:49.512]  I mean, he... Well, he's, this is, this was a, a, a fixed, contrived, uh, death.
[03:40:50.253 --> 03:40:56.759]  And Boris Johnson, bojo, apparently doesn't know this and is tweeting our, our thoughts.
[03:40:57.079 --> 03:41:00.602]  I mean, this guy shows up and people almost keel over.
[03:41:01.829 --> 03:41:02.910]  I don't want to spend too much time with you.
[03:41:02.930 --> 03:41:04.471]  I should've led the show with this.
[03:41:04.491 --> 03:41:05.111]  I should say up front.
[03:41:05.171 --> 03:41:07.973]  This former KGB colonel and his daughter go in a store.
[03:41:08.013 --> 03:41:08.413]  They come out.
[03:41:08.453 --> 03:41:09.353]  They fall over on a bench.
[03:41:09.634 --> 03:41:11.315]  They'll never let the Russians have samples for months.
[03:41:11.355 --> 03:41:11.895]  No one sees it.
[03:41:12.215 --> 03:41:13.016]  Now the daughter's dead.
[03:41:13.056 --> 03:41:13.376]  He's dead.
[03:41:13.396 --> 03:41:14.336]  They think, oh, the daughter's alive.
[03:41:14.657 --> 03:41:15.937]  Now he's alive and shows up.
[03:41:15.957 --> 03:41:16.958]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[03:41:17.178 --> 03:41:18.759]  It's like they think we have no memory.
[03:41:18.919 --> 03:41:20.540]  This whole thing is cuckoo level.
[03:41:21.200 --> 03:41:22.621]  Well, that's Skripal.
[03:41:22.681 --> 03:41:23.542]  That's a different story.
[03:41:23.602 --> 03:41:24.723]  But here's the thing, too.
[03:41:24.743 --> 03:41:26.584]  No, I know, but I'm saying that story, too.
[03:41:26.664 --> 03:41:27.424]  So explain this one.
[03:41:28.585 --> 03:41:29.285]  Well, what's happened is...
[03:41:31.678 --> 03:41:33.480]  I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh.
[03:41:33.820 --> 03:41:35.142]  No, I know about the other case, too.
[03:41:35.162 --> 03:41:36.022]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:41:36.082 --> 03:41:37.884]  As I brought up the chemical weapons, it's insane.
[03:41:38.865 --> 03:41:44.330]  But what's happening right now is you have Boris Johnson, who is tweeting, doesn't even know he's not dead.
[03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:45.591]  Now understand this.
[03:41:47.713 --> 03:41:50.135]  This is another guy they let go.
[03:41:50.215 --> 03:41:51.216]  So explain it.
[03:41:52.420 --> 03:41:53.181]  But wait to go back.
[03:41:53.461 --> 03:41:58.123]  When Tommy Robinson, and I gotta go back to this because your coverage of him, thank God you broke in for this.
[03:41:58.464 --> 03:42:02.946]  This is the one that absolutely, of course, hashtag Tommy Robinson.
[03:42:03.326 --> 03:42:03.987]  Guess who?
[03:42:04.607 --> 03:42:05.928]  Think about this, the irony.
[03:42:06.328 --> 03:42:14.592]  You've got, of course, denoticed in the UK, their own press told they cannot report on this story.
[03:42:15.033 --> 03:42:16.393]  Who had some of the best coverage?
[03:42:16.654 --> 03:42:18.955]  You, of course, and Sputnik and RT.
[03:42:19.795 --> 03:42:22.276]  Russian, Russian news organization.
[03:42:22.296 --> 03:42:24.176]  And it's only because they're not under this global control.
[03:42:24.216 --> 03:42:25.397]  My wife asked me at 10 a.m.
[03:42:25.777 --> 03:42:26.857]  She goes, why are you going in?
[03:42:26.877 --> 03:42:28.378]  And I said, I got a feeling.
[03:42:28.438 --> 03:42:30.658]  Hours later, you know, the demonstration started.
[03:42:30.698 --> 03:42:34.499]  I just knew you're secretly arresting Tommy, lying about him.
[03:42:34.579 --> 03:42:35.220]  We got to cover it.
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:36.060]  And of course it blew up.
[03:42:37.253 --> 03:42:44.235]  But this is also, this goes to show you, and how these people thought that this was a good idea.
[03:42:44.535 --> 03:42:45.695]  I would have said, listen.
[03:42:45.715 --> 03:42:48.155]  But it's the arrogance of tyrants, and I'm not coming back.
[03:42:48.196 --> 03:42:49.376]  I'm going to watch you when you come back.
[03:42:49.396 --> 03:42:54.237]  Explain the arrogance of this, to think that there's a huge pedophile ring hearing going on.
[03:42:54.517 --> 03:42:56.577]  He's just saying there's a hearing, not even saying what's in it.
[03:42:56.777 --> 03:42:58.138]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:42:58.158 --> 03:42:58.958]  Stay with us.
[03:43:03.408 --> 03:43:09.211]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott revealed a new plan Wednesday to reduce the danger of shootings in the state's schools.
[03:43:09.511 --> 03:43:16.374]  The School and Firearms Safety Action Plan makes dozens of recommendations concerning school security as well as mental health.
[03:43:16.754 --> 03:43:25.298]  Specific proposals include increasing the number of law enforcement officers on school grounds as well as mental health evaluations for at-risk students.
[03:43:25.538 --> 03:43:30.941]  The plan also calls for increased active shooter and emergency response training for local communities.
[03:43:31.261 --> 03:43:33.843]  And several pieces of legislation are up for debate.
[03:43:34.143 --> 03:43:51.114]  One such law would allow families, school administrators, or police to petition that a potentially dangerous individual be kept from owning firearms after legal due process, while another would require that proper authorities be alerted within 48 hours of any change to a person's legal ability to own a gun.
[03:43:51.635 --> 03:43:58.839]  Abbott says his plan provides strategies that can be used before the next school year begins to keep students safe when they return to school.
[03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:01.001]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[03:44:02.022 --> 03:44:05.245]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:05.685 --> 03:44:06.986]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:44:07.486 --> 03:44:19.016]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:44:19.717 --> 03:44:28.585]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:44:29.045 --> 03:44:34.850]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:39.754]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:44:40.255 --> 03:44:42.557]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:44:42.917 --> 03:44:44.258]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:44:44.658 --> 03:44:54.267]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:44:54.367 --> 03:44:56.469]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:44:57.049 --> 03:45:01.911]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:45:02.271 --> 03:45:05.173]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[03:45:05.933 --> 03:45:10.115]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[03:45:10.495 --> 03:45:12.756]  They're set to pass rules, not a law.
[03:45:13.396 --> 03:45:18.077]  That if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[03:45:18.477 --> 03:45:22.738]  CNN and many others are calling for Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:45:23.118 --> 03:45:27.039]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[03:45:27.219 --> 03:45:30.040]  Brainwash young people against Infowars.
[03:45:30.400 --> 03:45:34.621]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:45:35.502 --> 03:45:38.522]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:45:39.463 --> 03:45:40.943]  That's why it's more important than ever.
[03:45:42.011 --> 03:45:44.192]  That folks stay in contact with InfoWars.
[03:45:44.812 --> 03:46:02.996]  If you sign up for our free newsletter that goes out daily at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter, we will send you breaking videos, breaking articles, key analysis and links to all of our podcasts, all of our live feeds, all of our live streams at the bottom.
[03:46:03.236 --> 03:46:08.878]  There's a bunch of them and we've got backups so that we have that personal direct relationship with you.
[03:46:09.578 --> 03:46:16.282]  I was never good about email and, you know, collecting folks' email like everybody else does because I was always going for the latest cutting-edge stuff.
[03:46:16.322 --> 03:46:16.922]  We still do that.
[03:46:17.322 --> 03:46:21.344]  But all the experts have told me, Alex, if they shut everything down, it gets really bad.
[03:46:21.824 --> 03:46:30.929]  You've got to have a thumb drive with those emails so you can contact the base core of patriots that understand what's happening, the real remnant.
[03:46:31.489 --> 03:46:36.092]  Now, we're hoping for the best, ladies and gentlemen, but we're also preparing for the worst.
[03:46:36.332 --> 03:46:38.953]  That's why it's so critical, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:46:39.053 --> 03:46:52.898]  Let you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[03:46:53.138 --> 03:46:54.438]  That is critical to this fight.
[03:46:54.659 --> 03:47:00.881]  So please sign up for the free newsletter today and then share the emails with everyone you know to cause a chain reaction.
[03:47:06.303 --> 03:47:09.024]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.144 --> 03:47:15.945]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.285 --> 03:47:17.385]  Because there's a war on, or you're mine.
[03:47:17.405 --> 03:47:33.088]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I was mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine,
[03:47:33.903 --> 03:47:34.843]  I'm serious.
[03:47:35.344 --> 03:47:37.945]  I don't even know where to start with this.
[03:47:38.045 --> 03:47:43.367]  Which story, which... I gotta hand it to Alex because he gets me so psychically revved up.
[03:47:43.627 --> 03:47:44.908]  I don't even know where to start.
[03:47:45.388 --> 03:47:47.949]  In the waning moments of this thing, and it's an honor to be with you.
[03:47:48.409 --> 03:47:49.710]  Let me get down to simply this.
[03:47:50.010 --> 03:47:51.971]  This is what is on my top of mind.
[03:47:52.351 --> 03:47:53.551]  I've got to share this with you.
[03:47:55.192 --> 03:48:01.475]  You know, when it became evident regarding the Roseanne case,
[03:48:02.426 --> 03:48:08.149]  Most of the time, people think that, well, that's a news story, that's some entertainment story.
[03:48:08.549 --> 03:48:09.390]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:48:09.870 --> 03:48:11.231]  It's not important, it's not critical.
[03:48:12.111 --> 03:48:15.953]  Frank Sapp has said one time that Hollywood is the entertainment division or branch of the Pentagon.
[03:48:16.833 --> 03:48:23.657]  And paraphrasing that somewhat is that entertainment and what's happening there is a microcosm of what's happening elsewhere.
[03:48:24.090 --> 03:48:30.275]  You know, years ago, sports and the military were always great harbingers of what was happening.
[03:48:30.295 --> 03:48:35.459]  They were pythonic and vatic, and you would read the entrails of the societal beast by watching what they did.
[03:48:35.780 --> 03:48:37.141]  Baseball was the first to integrate.
[03:48:37.501 --> 03:48:38.622]  The military integrated.
[03:48:38.982 --> 03:48:39.923]  Drug testing.
[03:48:40.544 --> 03:48:44.507]  Watch what they did first, and then it permeated back into society.
[03:48:45.891 --> 03:48:57.443]  Entertainment Today is, this is the feeder system, this is the money system, this is the fundraising arm of the Democratic National Committee, the DNC, the professional left, the deep state, whatever you want to call it.
[03:48:58.764 --> 03:49:05.932]  What's happening is that they create the memes, they create the propaganda, they create the tropes and the memes, and they send these out.
[03:49:07.088 --> 03:49:10.870]  And they work in coordination with Hillary Clinton and others.
[03:49:11.311 --> 03:49:18.275]  So when you see, you see a Bob Iger or an ABC or a CNN or whatever, it's not just some news organization.
[03:49:18.495 --> 03:49:20.316]  Let me remind you of something I said before in passing.
[03:49:21.577 --> 03:49:23.118]  Those used to be mainstream media.
[03:49:23.799 --> 03:49:25.800]  Those used to be what we would call mainstream media.
[03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:26.600]  That's not.
[03:49:26.901 --> 03:49:27.781]  This is mainstream media.
[03:49:28.201 --> 03:49:30.543]  What we're seeing right now, what we're doing, this is mainstream media.
[03:49:30.583 --> 03:49:31.904]  This is as mainstream as it gets.
[03:49:32.984 --> 03:49:33.785]  And it may be louder.
[03:49:34.305 --> 03:49:35.246]  It may be more informal.
[03:49:35.876 --> 03:49:40.785]  But it is more information-packed, more intellectually calorie-dense than anything you've ever seen before.
[03:49:40.986 --> 03:49:43.050]  So this is now mainstream media.
[03:49:43.410 --> 03:49:46.236]  So when Roseanne came along, I said simply this.
[03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:54.486]  We as Americans, and I truly believe this, and my countrymen, us, and I think humans, believe in this natural law notion called parity.
[03:49:54.666 --> 03:49:56.387]  Parity, comedy, C-O-M-I-T-Y.
[03:49:56.827 --> 03:49:58.649]  Parity, equal treatment, equal justice.
[03:49:58.789 --> 03:50:03.392]  Equal treatment, equal justice under the law, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
[03:50:03.792 --> 03:50:06.514]  Equality, justice with the scales.
[03:50:06.534 --> 03:50:07.215]  We have this thing about
[03:50:08.012 --> 03:50:09.773]  Treat me like everybody else.
[03:50:10.353 --> 03:50:15.034]  The notion of equal protection says, why are you treating African-Americans or Asians different than whatever?
[03:50:15.414 --> 03:50:16.995]  You have to be able to justify why.
[03:50:17.035 --> 03:50:20.196]  Because believe it or not, in this country, we treat some people differently.
[03:50:20.536 --> 03:50:23.997]  Minors, convicted felons, men versus women.
[03:50:24.077 --> 03:50:26.498]  Sometimes you can do it, but it depends why.
[03:50:27.298 --> 03:50:30.339]  So Roseanne Barr came along and she said, I'm going to do this show again.
[03:50:30.419 --> 03:50:31.120]  I'm going to retool.
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:31.960]  I'm going to do it.
[03:50:33.060 --> 03:50:35.241]  And at that moment, they huddled.
[03:50:37.017 --> 03:50:38.118]  I don't know this for a fact.
[03:50:38.258 --> 03:50:39.758]  I am just imagining this.
[03:50:40.299 --> 03:50:42.239]  I'm just giving you my kind of an idea.
[03:50:42.499 --> 03:50:43.280]  Theoretical, perhaps.
[03:50:44.180 --> 03:50:46.101]  They got together and they say, this cannot work.
[03:50:47.442 --> 03:50:48.202]  They say, but it's got to work.
[03:50:48.242 --> 03:50:49.943]  No, no, this cannot work.
[03:50:50.143 --> 03:50:51.183]  Yeah, but this is great for ABC.
[03:50:51.463 --> 03:50:52.004]  No, no, no, no.
[03:50:53.404 --> 03:50:59.167]  For some reason, Roseanne has been forged and connected with the notion of Trump.
[03:50:59.347 --> 03:51:00.207]  Don't ask me why.
[03:51:00.547 --> 03:51:01.848]  She is Trump.
[03:51:02.719 --> 03:51:09.001]  And if she succeeds, this will be the message that we've been trying to avoid for years.
[03:51:09.581 --> 03:51:19.524]  That we in Hollywood, we the entertainment division of the military-industrial complex, we've been trying to promote propaganda and have been saying, no, you don't understand.
[03:51:19.764 --> 03:51:21.265]  They share our views.
[03:51:21.345 --> 03:51:24.886]  They share who we are and we know what they're doing.
[03:51:24.966 --> 03:51:25.166]  No!
[03:51:25.966 --> 03:51:27.107]  So Roseanne tweeted this thing.
[03:51:27.127 --> 03:51:29.587]  Okay, I'm not even going to defend it.
[03:51:29.667 --> 03:51:30.227]  You do that.
[03:51:30.347 --> 03:51:31.328]  I don't even care what it is.
[03:51:31.608 --> 03:51:31.868]  Okay.
[03:51:32.617 --> 03:51:39.021]  So I would say, well, you should treat Roseanne like you treat everybody else who said equally terrible things.
[03:51:39.361 --> 03:51:46.546]  And by the way, this extrajudicial kind of review of what somebody does, this is what we call in law a collateral matter, a collateral issue.
[03:51:46.966 --> 03:51:51.449]  You know, when something is not really germane to what we're talking about, it's collateral.
[03:51:51.869 --> 03:51:59.454]  It's like if you lie in court, it's not really perjury if it's about a collateral matter, something about the color of the shirt you were wearing, if it's not germane to the case.
[03:51:59.734 --> 03:52:01.876]  So if somebody is on their own time,
[03:52:02.236 --> 03:52:06.520]  Tweeting something stupid, far be it from me, what does it have to do with the show?
[03:52:06.960 --> 03:52:14.967]  Well, this has become merged, has become merged, and it's become this minefield, this tripwire, this third rail.
[03:52:15.447 --> 03:52:24.115]  And what people do right now is, even in their profile, they'll say, retweets do not mean an endorsement of ratification and, you know, an endorsement of a particular thought or idea.
[03:52:24.135 --> 03:52:25.976]  Okay, so here's Roseanne.
[03:52:26.437 --> 03:52:29.880]  Now, they've known about Roseanne forever.
[03:52:30.720 --> 03:52:31.741]  That's why they hired her.
[03:52:32.301 --> 03:52:36.025]  The reason why Roseanne is great is because she's who she is.
[03:52:36.845 --> 03:52:44.852]  She is this bold, bawdy, in-your-face, risky, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin.
[03:52:45.173 --> 03:52:53.300]  Go through history, find anybody, and it sounds... I mean, if you've ever heard of Lenny Bruce, Eugene, it's pretty pale by comparison, but at the time it was cutting edge.
[03:52:53.540 --> 03:52:54.501]  So they knew who she was.
[03:52:55.248 --> 03:52:56.489]  She was tweeting the whole time.
[03:52:56.569 --> 03:52:57.570]  She's been doing this.
[03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:59.632]  So, they said, we're going to hire her.
[03:52:59.672 --> 03:53:01.493]  They knew exactly what she was.
[03:53:01.974 --> 03:53:04.075]  It's like the couple who gets the, you know, the pitbull.
[03:53:04.356 --> 03:53:05.557]  The pitbull bites somebody.
[03:53:05.857 --> 03:53:06.898]  Now, the pitbulls are bad.
[03:53:07.298 --> 03:53:08.499]  But then again, you blame the dog.
[03:53:08.519 --> 03:53:10.341]  The dog says, this is what I'm trained to do.
[03:53:10.361 --> 03:53:11.622]  This is what you wanted me to do.
[03:53:11.742 --> 03:53:11.882]  Okay.
[03:53:12.907 --> 03:53:16.128]  So she does this, and they wanted her to fail from the beginning.
[03:53:16.408 --> 03:53:24.212]  Because believe it or not, they are so committed to the idea that this ideology must fail, that they would even lose millions of dollars to say, aha, we told you.
[03:53:24.672 --> 03:53:25.572]  See, it just doesn't work.
[03:53:25.812 --> 03:53:39.638]  You got that Tim Allen, you got that Clint Eastwood, you got that, and by the by, the number of people in Hollywood who are closeted conservatives, closeted Trump supporters, closeted, in fact,
[03:53:40.305 --> 03:53:45.293]  Everybody's closet, because Hollywood is a lie as you know that, but she had to fail.
[03:53:45.313 --> 03:53:48.819]  So anyway, so she starts off and they said, well, let's see what happens.
[03:53:49.747 --> 03:53:50.467]  Blockbuster.
[03:53:50.887 --> 03:53:52.248]  Biggest thing anybody's ever seen.
[03:53:52.308 --> 03:53:52.588]  Why?
[03:53:52.948 --> 03:53:54.888]  Because she connects with America.
[03:53:55.108 --> 03:53:56.508]  The middle of the Gaussian curve.
[03:53:56.828 --> 03:53:58.009]  The middle of the bell curve.
[03:53:58.289 --> 03:53:59.509]  That's who America is.
[03:53:59.929 --> 03:54:01.970]  Main Street, Midwest, whatever it is.
[03:54:02.310 --> 03:54:07.331]  Families in a little town, in a bad couch with an Afghan, and worried about stuff.
[03:54:07.651 --> 03:54:08.791]  That's who she was.
[03:54:08.811 --> 03:54:11.432]  That's who the old show was, that's who the new show was.
[03:54:11.452 --> 03:54:16.012]  Okay, there's some interesting things about children wearing tutus and... Okay, fine.
[03:54:17.133 --> 03:54:18.213]  It just kept getting better.
[03:54:18.937 --> 03:54:21.798]  And better, and bigger, and blowing up.
[03:54:22.278 --> 03:54:28.441]  She had bigger ratings, and now, from 20 years ago, to different platforms, to even be even greater!
[03:54:29.261 --> 03:54:30.022]  So they were waiting.
[03:54:30.442 --> 03:54:38.985]  Waiting for her, because she represented... I don't want to say us, but she represented a group of people that Hollywood wanted to distance themselves from.
[03:54:39.826 --> 03:54:40.986]  Well, they waited, and they waited.
[03:54:41.146 --> 03:54:41.666]  Well, they got her.
[03:54:42.387 --> 03:54:42.827]  They got her.
[03:54:43.207 --> 03:54:44.848]  The Bob Iger, what, he calls her Valerie Jarrett?
[03:54:44.888 --> 03:54:45.528]  Let me tell you something.
[03:54:46.949 --> 03:54:47.849]  Look at me and listen to me.
[03:54:48.982 --> 03:54:50.243]  America doesn't care about this.
[03:54:51.364 --> 03:54:51.884]  Doesn't care.
[03:54:52.865 --> 03:55:00.349]  You ask anybody, you pull somebody up, give them some kind of truth serum, put some kind of truth detector, look at the way, just ask them, do you really care about this?
[03:55:00.529 --> 03:55:02.611]  Do you care about this?
[03:55:02.971 --> 03:55:06.393]  Even the people who are the most art, the most vocal, they don't care about this.
[03:55:06.994 --> 03:55:07.854]  Because it's part of a game.
[03:55:07.894 --> 03:55:15.299]  It's like the guy who was taught and he's raised from a young age to hate the Red Sox, he's a diehard Yankee.
[03:55:15.739 --> 03:55:16.720]  This is not about
[03:55:17.589 --> 03:55:17.929]  Issues.
[03:55:17.989 --> 03:55:20.532]  It's about feeling a gut in my side versus your side.
[03:55:21.172 --> 03:55:23.594]  So all this Roseanne case is about is simply this.
[03:55:23.954 --> 03:55:24.475]  Very simply.
[03:55:24.895 --> 03:55:26.556]  Treat her like everybody else.
[03:55:26.877 --> 03:55:28.818]  Now, in the meantime, we have this Samantha Bee case.
[03:55:29.399 --> 03:55:30.179]  Pay attention to that.
[03:55:30.340 --> 03:55:31.160]  How are they going to handle that?
[03:55:31.601 --> 03:55:32.642]  Next, you've got Joy Reid.
[03:55:33.042 --> 03:55:38.146]  Joy Reid, who, by the way, was far more, far more Islamophobic and xenophobic and all the phobics you can imagine.
[03:55:38.586 --> 03:55:42.370]  Then, the other day, MSDNC had that roundtable, that chart.
[03:55:42.410 --> 03:55:43.190]  It was Valerie Jarrett.
[03:55:43.851 --> 03:55:46.433]  Of course, it was Al Sharpton, Chris Hayes,
[03:55:47.347 --> 03:55:47.787]  Joy Reid.
[03:55:47.988 --> 03:55:50.610]  By the way, Al Sharpton, in a weird way, I admire him.
[03:55:50.650 --> 03:55:51.210]  Let me tell you something.
[03:55:51.951 --> 03:56:00.218]  Al Sharpton, if you ever meet him, is one of the nicest, most ingratiating, friendly people you've ever met in your life.
[03:56:00.318 --> 03:56:00.798]  True story.
[03:56:00.858 --> 03:56:01.098]  True.
[03:56:02.279 --> 03:56:06.503]  He has been hit with so much stuff, he is almost impermeable.
[03:56:06.663 --> 03:56:09.765]  He's like this bacteria-resistant bug.
[03:56:10.026 --> 03:56:11.107]  You can't kill it.
[03:56:11.427 --> 03:56:12.348]  You can't hurt it.
[03:56:12.648 --> 03:56:14.269]  He's been hit with everything from Tijuana, Bali.
[03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:15.190]  So there's that.
[03:56:15.828 --> 03:56:17.089]  Right now, they are scrambling.
[03:56:17.350 --> 03:56:20.172]  And what's happening right now, in the waning minutes of... Listen to me.
[03:56:21.273 --> 03:56:23.556]  Roseanne is not about a TV show.
[03:56:24.016 --> 03:56:24.617]  It's about us.
[03:56:25.297 --> 03:56:29.902]  It's about right versus wrong, and it's about a faction of America that nobody ever addresses.
[03:56:30.729 --> 03:56:34.670]  Nobody, repeat, look at me, nobody cares about what Roseanne said.
[03:56:34.991 --> 03:56:36.491]  Nobody knows who Valerie Jarrett is.
[03:56:36.911 --> 03:56:39.252]  Nobody's making... This is an excuse.
[03:56:39.752 --> 03:56:40.753]  It was the tripwire.
[03:56:41.193 --> 03:56:42.873]  It was the oops, we've got her.
[03:56:43.513 --> 03:56:45.334]  Watch what happens now.
[03:56:45.994 --> 03:56:48.375]  And watch what happens as the next thing.
[03:56:48.715 --> 03:56:50.596]  And Roseanne, if you're listening,
[03:56:51.375 --> 03:57:10.050]  Your future is going to be in a platform similar to this, where you can say whatever you'd like, and you will be overwhelmed with love, adoration, peons, pedagyrics, fealty, and an embrace of you the likes of which you have never seen.
[03:57:10.683 --> 03:57:12.884]  All right, my friends, I believe that is it for me.
[03:57:13.344 --> 03:57:16.106]  Alex Jones, thank you so much for allowing me to be with you today.
