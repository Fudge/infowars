[00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.186]  There is a war.
[00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:19.648]  It's happening now.
[00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:22.351]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:24.713]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:26.956]  We are the resistance.
[00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:29.058]  We are the Infowar.
[00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:36.176]  We're here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:38.660]  It's hard to believe so much has happened in the last year.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.022]  Happy New Year.
[00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:41.864]  It's now January 1st, 2018.
[00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:59.246]  And if you thought 2016 and 17 were momentous, building towards the cultural, spiritual, technological singularity, well, you ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:04.589]  I am extremely thankful to God, my family, the crew here at InfoWars, all of you.
[00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:09.614]  that are out there watching and listening to make this transmission possible.
[00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.757]  I am very, very humbled to be your host.
[00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:24.103]  Well, today on New Year's, I thought we should go back and look at one of the biggest, if not one of the most important events in 2017.
[00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:24.844]  That was the inauguration
[00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:32.617]  Not just the election of Donald John Trump as the 45th president.
[00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:35.139]  It was a referendum on the globalists.
[00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:48.933]  It was an overthrow and an overturning of their propaganda, of their lies, of their attempts to steal elections, their operations having millions of people vote with the names of dead people from the voter registration rolls.
[00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:50.555]  It was a repudiation
[00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:53.197]  Of everything they threw against us.
[00:01:53.697 --> 00:02:06.527]  And it is part of a larger global trend of nationalism and populism that even the Financial Times of London and many others admit is basically unstoppable.
[00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:09.049]  Here's an article from just last week of the Sunday Express.
[00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.450]  Populist uprising.
[00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.152]  Anti-EU parties will continue to soar.
[00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:24.294]  Tony Blair's think tank admits, as if we need Mr. EU, Mr. Globalist, Mr. Arab Spring, to tell us something we don't already know.
[00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:36.827]  The point is, they're losing, we're winning, as the establishment has less and less credibility, as people more and more trust their own instincts, their own research, and get back to common sense.
[00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:39.049]  So, coming up, we have got a breakdown
[00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:07.114]  Uh, of President Trump and the inauguration from that day when I was live in D.C.
[00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:08.835]  and so much more.
[00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:13.238]  And then I got back to town that Sunday morning after the inauguration.
[00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:14.038]  It was on Friday.
[00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:22.944]  And I did a breakdown in studio with clips from Trump's historic speech that was extremely important and powerful, obviously.
[00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:29.008]  And then we could see, not even a year later, but I guess exactly
[00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.857]  Eleven months and a few days later, eleven months and change.
[00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:42.243]  Eleven months and a day later, look how the world has already changed so much.
[00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:45.427]  It's technically been eleven months and ten days or so.
[00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:50.152]  So, this is an incredible, incredible, incredible
[00:03:51.253 --> 00:04:13.676]  Uh, time to be alive, and it is just such a blessing that humanity is beginning to start the process of waking up and digging out of the cultural and spiritual cancer that is the new world order system that seeks to end competition, end families, end independence in a final revolution
[00:04:14.577 --> 00:04:14.777]  I think?
[00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:43.725]  No matter what color we are and where we came from, we have to come together and understand that everything the globalists are pushing, though it's all packaged with a bunch of sugar coating, is absolute, total, and complete poison.
[00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:54.414]  So please be part of the second global revolution against tyranny, not just the second American revolution, and spread the live links to this feed or the local radio station that you're listening to or TV station you're watching.
[00:04:54.654 --> 00:04:57.977]  Because, again, you are the reason we're overriding their censorship and control.
[00:04:58.257 --> 00:04:59.558]  You're the reason we're breaking their back.
[00:05:00.018 --> 00:05:01.158]  You're the reason we defeated Hillary.
[00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.439]  Because you are the resistance.
[00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:08.102]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:08.402 --> 00:05:12.844]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:05:13.164 --> 00:05:21.508]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:05:21.848 --> 00:05:25.090]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.273]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:05:30.593 --> 00:05:37.576]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:05:37.897 --> 00:05:41.498]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.161]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:54.205]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a $50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:58.527]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[00:05:58.807 --> 00:06:00.228]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:12.455]  So as true classical liberals in the vein of Thomas Jefferson, I want to salute all of you of every race, color, and creed who are one race, red blood.
[00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.091]  You understand the globalists are in trouble.
[00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.972]  You broke the back of Hillary Clinton and the crime syndicate.
[00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:23.893]  You went up against the mainstream fake news media and broke their will.
[00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:30.915]  You stood like a lighthouse out on a promontory in a raging storm and beamed out the truth.
[00:06:31.615 --> 00:06:34.436]  You are the victors.
[00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:35.857]  You are the resistance.
[00:06:36.277 --> 00:06:37.217]  You are the power.
[00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:41.258]  You are the windows through which God's light shines into our world.
[00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:42.839]  You are destiny.
[00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.791]  And this isn't some Oprah Winfrey name-it-and-claim-it secret stuff.
[00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:48.811]  This is real.
[00:06:49.191 --> 00:07:09.119]  The history, the culture, the will, the understanding, the Christian ethos, the English common law ethos, the classic Judaic ethos of the Old Testament, not of the modern forms of Judaism.
[00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:14.689]  But the ancient forms, about not being corrupt, not being part of the manipulative systems.
[00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:18.410]  That all is coming back into the world right now.
[00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.391]  And the knowledge is coming back into the world.
[00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:27.192]  And the knowledge of Solomon is coming back into the world.
[00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:28.933]  And with it is great danger.
[00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:30.793]  The globalists are afraid of information.
[00:07:30.813 --> 00:07:33.574]  They're afraid of freedom because it does incredible things.
[00:07:34.374 --> 00:07:38.855]  But they're the ones suppressing information and suppressing humanity and creating nothing but abominations.
[00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:45.137]  And so a great unchaining of humanity is in the process right now.
[00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:46.138]  No one can deny it.
[00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:53.683]  The globalists in their own elite publications that they think we don't read admit that globalism, if Hillary fell, was basically done.
[00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:58.306]  And now they're in complete panic mode saying, get rid of Trump.
[00:07:58.626 --> 00:07:59.727]  We've hijacked the U.S.
[00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:00.167]  before.
[00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:03.009]  They've taken control of our main command base.
[00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.511]  If we can't get rid of him, it's over for us.
[00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:11.749]  And so they're in complete panic mode, and they admit, we have broken their will.
[00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:13.251]  We have broken their back.
[00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:15.653]  Thanks to God Almighty, the Creator.
[00:08:18.116 --> 00:08:20.398]  This is a historic time to be alive right now.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.242]  And that's why Hollywood's dying.
[00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:24.643]  It's why the NFL's dying.
[00:08:24.663 --> 00:08:26.225]  And again, we're not just saying they're dying.
[00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:26.805]  They're dying.
[00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:30.692]  It's why the modern cults are falling apart.
[00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:47.837]  It's why people are pulling away from fraud everywhere and getting back to basic common sense and back to God and back to humbleness and realizing that Hollywood and mainstream media and none of these systems are going to deliver anything but bondage and enslavement and fraud.
[00:08:49.557 --> 00:08:51.057]  Look at the collapse of their system.
[00:08:51.157 --> 00:08:52.078]  Look at the scandals.
[00:08:52.518 --> 00:08:53.738]  Look at their ratings plans.
[00:08:53.778 --> 00:08:56.579]  Look at Hollywood doing the worst it's done in its history.
[00:08:58.368 --> 00:09:04.729]  Yes, there's large numbers of victims, a large remnant of victims that they still prey upon and control and program.
[00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:06.470]  But those people are followers.
[00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.450]  Those people are slaves.
[00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.531]  Those people are seen as cattle by the globalists.
[00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:14.771]  They are victims.
[00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:26.294]  Don't ever let their bullying or their attempted group thing to intimidate you ever make you cave in, because you're caving in to the master signal of programming.
[00:09:26.314 --> 00:09:27.174]  And that's what I want you to know.
[00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:33.880]  Despite the rigging of Google, Facebook, Twitter, despite them throwing everything they could, Trump was elected.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.580]  Is he perfect?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.441]  No, none of us are.
[00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.581]  But he means well.
[00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:39.201]  He's not out to get America.
[00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:45.803]  And he's doing classical things that will create a boom in the economy and rising wages and rising savings.
[00:09:46.143 --> 00:09:47.843]  And they are cutting some areas of government.
[00:09:48.423 --> 00:09:52.464]  They need to cut more so that we can pay down the deficit, not just expand it.
[00:09:52.984 --> 00:10:06.173]  But compared to the globalists that we're going to expand the deficits, bankrupt things, pick the winners and losers, bring in austerity like it's a cool thing, and make us permanently poor in their own admissions to control us, that's called feudalism.
[00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:08.374]  That's called servitude.
[00:10:08.654 --> 00:10:11.056]  That's called serfdom, where that term comes from.
[00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:14.578]  And again, it's the admitted plan of the globalists.
[00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:17.861]  Their arrogance has and will continue to be
[00:10:18.877 --> 00:10:19.597]  Their downfall.
[00:10:19.637 --> 00:10:20.818]  They can't help it.
[00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:22.959]  They have a disdain for everyone around them.
[00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:24.419]  They don't want to teach people.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.100]  They want to hurt people.
[00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:28.121]  They're like spiders.
[00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:29.462]  They do not create.
[00:10:30.502 --> 00:10:31.943]  And they're being broken right now.
[00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:46.549]  Their main push to totally take over the world and totally have hegemonic world government and totally destroy the family and totally break down society finally brought humanity out of a coma into an awakening.
[00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:47.750]  And we're laying on our bed
[00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.611]  In a coma for years.
[00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:50.712]  We have trouble moving.
[00:10:52.173 --> 00:10:53.514]  But our focus is coming back.
[00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:54.595]  Our memory is coming back.
[00:10:54.635 --> 00:11:01.040]  We're now getting up from the bed as they attempted to get us to lay back down and, you know, take their poison culture back.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.324]  But we're now pushing away towards the doors, out towards the front porch, out towards the sun.
[00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:13.070]  And the beautiful vista God has prepared for us out there, out leaving this filthy, fetid coffin.
[00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:20.681]  This matrix box, this artificial construct that they had been putting us into, we're coming out of it.
[00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:26.502]  In 2017, 2016 was a great time of awakening.
[00:11:26.522 --> 00:11:39.845]  2017 was a great time of explosive change and honor and delivery and truth and expansion of that and of globalist counter-strike.
[00:11:39.885 --> 00:11:41.886]  It was a great year of battle.
[00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:44.322]  As the storms come together.
[00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:53.569]  But 2018 is going to be the deciding year, as the globalists have always threatened, you don't give us world government, we're going to bring you into World War III.
[00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:57.131]  That's why they gave the Soviets the weapons, they gave the Chinese the weapons.
[00:11:57.912 --> 00:12:00.554]  They couldn't develop those, they didn't have the technology, the communists.
[00:12:01.594 --> 00:12:09.180]  And they built up that threat to then create a global threat, so a global government was needed to fight that threat.
[00:12:10.117 --> 00:12:17.302]  And so every time a nation tries to come out of that and the strangling anti-family, anti-Christian globalism, they try to invoke it again.
[00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:34.914]  So Trump, instead of running away from the threat of war, is running headlong to face it in an attempt to show real strength and conviction to break the will of the Communist Chinese that run North Korea and the globalists that have been manipulating it as a detonator for war and a way to get the U.S.
[00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:39.237]  in line to allow Chinese expansion globally for the last few decades.
[00:12:41.215 --> 00:12:47.382]  America was about getting away from royalty, and away from North Korea's royalty, and being about the individual.
[00:12:47.422 --> 00:12:59.917]  So you see the tabloids and the media worshipping, and like, oh, Trump might get rejected by Hollywood, and he might get rejected by some sniveling prince that sits there and has some effete, effeminate,
[00:13:00.658 --> 00:13:17.419]  Foppish interview with Obama, and then, oh, the world rejects Trump, and the royalty rejects him, and the scared British Prime Minister, you know, in her kept nation run by Islamicists, oh, and Khan, the Islamic mayor of London, we don't want you.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.102]  This is ridiculous!
[00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:24.244]  Trump is a rock star with the people in the UK now and a leader for fighting globalism.
[00:13:24.544 --> 00:13:26.104]  InfoWars is incredibly popular.
[00:13:26.524 --> 00:13:30.686]  We're winning because royalty hates us, because Hollywood hates us.
[00:13:30.946 --> 00:13:32.026]  This is all a good thing.
[00:13:32.786 --> 00:13:35.047]  I've had invitations from the highest levels of globalism.
[00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:37.189]  Highest levels of rock and roll, all of it.
[00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:41.933]  And I just don't even accept them anymore because I'm just not part of it.
[00:13:42.293 --> 00:13:46.878]  Even if they're halfway decent people, the whole system they represent is a giant rotting carcass.
[00:13:47.418 --> 00:13:51.682]  And I don't want to be part of an old, rotting, diseased, fetid, demonic carcass.
[00:13:51.862 --> 00:13:52.603]  I trailblaze.
[00:13:52.923 --> 00:13:53.724]  I'm into the future.
[00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:54.925]  I want us to go to space.
[00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:56.667]  I want life extension technology.
[00:13:56.767 --> 00:13:57.648]  I believe in the people.
[00:13:57.888 --> 00:13:59.710]  I want to build a world for and by
[00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:00.986]  Humans.
[00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:05.889]  Not technocracy, not the age of humans is dead, not all this crap we get told.
[00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:24.158]  We just accept that we're supposed to watch NFL sports become giant fat people, roll over, and then the tech giants who worship the AI gods that I first told you about 10 years ago in Endgame, then take over and overwrite the world and build this perfect new thing, when they don't even know where they came from or who they are.
[00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.234]  And that's in the news as well.
[00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:27.515]  Remember Endgame?
[00:14:27.855 --> 00:14:30.856]  Told you about the tech gods, how they worship the AI computer.
[00:14:31.476 --> 00:14:33.836]  Because that's in their internal writings that are public.
[00:14:34.176 --> 00:14:38.298]  Now Elon Musk comes out and says, beware those that tell you about tech gods.
[00:14:38.318 --> 00:14:41.719]  They're exterminists that want to take over the planet and think humans are obsolete.
[00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:45.199]  They're programming the AI right now to get rid of us and make us obsolete.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.400]  That's because that's what they've been planning!
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.041]  How many years have I told you?
[00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:51.021]  I've known about that 18 years.
[00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:54.062]  It's just the evergreen
[00:14:55.606 --> 00:14:56.427]  Film is in-game.
[00:14:56.567 --> 00:14:57.888]  It's free online!

[00:15:02.912 --> 00:15:03.552]  Get it out there!
[00:15:03.612 --> 00:15:04.393]  Buy the DVD!
[00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:05.674]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:08.536]  The point is, that's the reality.
[00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:09.817]  And here's some of these articles.
[00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:12.459]  2017, the year AI took over.
[00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:16.323]  That's RT and they're already putting
[00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:18.047]  I think so.
[00:15:35.544 --> 00:15:37.026]  And you're showing you're obsolete.
[00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:40.169]  Rasmussen, Trump approval hits one month high.
[00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:40.709]  He's at 45.
[00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.813]  And Rasmussen, you know, again, adding 9 to 12 usually.
[00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:48.257]  You can go look up their particular nomenclature here and their methodology.
[00:15:49.358 --> 00:15:50.519]  So what's that got Trump at?
[00:15:50.539 --> 00:15:50.519]  65?
[00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:56.025]  55?
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.025]  I mean, God only knows.
[00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:03.214]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.122]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:18.206]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:26.331]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:32.394]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:17:33.014 --> 00:17:41.719]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including

[00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:40.146]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:43.288]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[00:18:43.828 --> 00:18:48.231]  The silent majority is no longer silent, and we control the narrative now.
[00:18:49.632 --> 00:18:56.396]  This is the War Room.
[00:18:56.416 --> 00:19:00.059]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[00:19:57.869 --> 00:19:59.671]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:11.790]  It's the year their BS stopped working on a majority of people, and it's getting worse for them by the minute.
[00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:26.176]  All the evidence shows, all the graphs show, all the feedback shows, all the bellwethers, all the weather vanes, all the statistics, all the real raw data shows a global explosive awakening against everything mainstream.
[00:20:26.436 --> 00:20:33.479]  Hollywood, not just here, but the Hollywoods they've got in France, and the Hollywoods they've got in Italy, and the Hollywoods they've got in Japan.
[00:20:34.694 --> 00:20:37.857]  All the establishment media, people are running away from it.
[00:20:38.097 --> 00:20:38.997]  They're sick of it.
[00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:40.319]  They can't stand it.
[00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:51.627]  The establishment gurus, the establishment systems, the establishment New Age stuff, all of it, people are running away from it and rejecting it.
[00:20:52.028 --> 00:20:53.249]  GMO, they're rejecting.
[00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:54.570]  Vaccines, they're rejecting.
[00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.351]  Because we know they're tainted and being spiked.
[00:20:57.252 --> 00:20:59.353]  Globalism, mainline sports, all of it.
[00:20:59.614 --> 00:21:02.556]  And their answer is, we'll march EU armies in if you try to leave Europe.
[00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:05.116]  The EU.
[00:21:05.136 --> 00:21:06.777]  We'll get rid of your national sports teams.
[00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:09.339]  That'll make you love the EU if it's only our sports team.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.221]  All of this is a desperate attempt and it's not working.
[00:21:13.763 --> 00:21:17.405]  And their final big desperate attempt was to say anyone that likes Trump is Hitler.
[00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:19.006]  Anyone that's a nationalist is Hitler.
[00:21:19.207 --> 00:21:26.912]  We're going to call you horrible names and destroy you and fire you or kill you or shoot you like Congressman Scalise if you don't give in to us.
[00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:27.993]  And it didn't work.
[00:21:28.113 --> 00:21:30.255]  People turned the corner to the bullies.
[00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:37.959]  They took the fact that we were calm and the fact that we were asleep for weakness.
[00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:46.990]  Instead, now the sleeping giant has awoken, like when Admiral Yamamoto telegraphed back December 7th, 1941, the day of the living infamy.
[00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.111]  He telegraphed back the next day.
[00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:50.594]  He said, fear, we've awakened a sleeping giant.
[00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:59.467]  So just think about that, how we've been domesticated, what we've been turned into, and now we're turning the corner.
[00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:01.268]  So all they've got is racism now.
[00:22:01.689 --> 00:22:07.014]  Divide and conquer, how the British would go into India or other places and be outnumbered a thousand to one or more and take over.
[00:22:07.694 --> 00:22:15.841]  I mean, a couple thousand British troops and their sociologists that they would send in years before as traders and stuff, you know, to get businesses.
[00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:23.428]  They would come in and play tribes off against each other, and in a matter of years, they took over China, they took over India, divide and conquer.
[00:22:23.989 --> 00:22:25.090]  And this is how they did it.
[00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.451]  Tribe against tribe.
[00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:31.155]  Even though the Indians look the same, act the same, even the same culture, they played them off against each other.
[00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:32.590]  And that's their plan.
[00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.431]  Hindu against Muslim, you name it.
[00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:39.555]  Racist BuzzFeed lists things white people need to stop running in 2018.
[00:22:40.216 --> 00:22:41.977]  And this is the whole theme from universities everywhere.
[00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:43.439]  Whites are inherently bad.
[00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:44.860]  Whites are inherently evil.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.763]  Whites are inherently not good genetically.
[00:22:49.604 --> 00:22:50.545]  What did Cink Uygur?
[00:22:51.145 --> 00:22:52.366]  Or Chink... What did he say his name?
[00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:53.207]  Jinger Guger?
[00:22:53.787 --> 00:22:54.568]  Clink Blunger?
[00:22:54.888 --> 00:22:55.889]  I'm really not making fun of his name.
[00:22:55.929 --> 00:22:57.731]  I can't ever... Chink Unger?
[00:22:58.091 --> 00:22:58.651]  Chink Unger.
[00:22:59.659 --> 00:23:04.842]  You know, in his writing, she's like, these women are genetically trash and garbage.
[00:23:05.043 --> 00:23:07.044]  Well, he's a Muslim from Turkey, folks!
[00:23:08.705 --> 00:23:17.351]  I mean, of course he has... I mean, it's just like Linda Serser's mother writes books about chopping all women's genitals off, and then she leads the women's marches.
[00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:21.891]  I mean, it's all about force-feeding you something ridiculous.
[00:23:22.711 --> 00:23:23.812]  And that's it right here.
[00:23:23.892 --> 00:23:27.014]  BuzzFeed has published a list of 37 things white people need to stop running in 2018.
[00:23:27.174 --> 00:23:31.116]  Yet another example of left's brazen anti-white racism.
[00:23:32.357 --> 00:23:38.000]  And then it just goes over the list of things that is just absolutely incredible.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.282]  So this is all they've got.
[00:23:41.302 --> 00:23:45.104]  I mean, can you imagine what you could say about 30 things or
[00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:50.752]  That blacks do that's bad.
[00:23:51.273 --> 00:23:53.098]  And then stereotype and say horrible things.
[00:23:54.301 --> 00:23:55.203]  I mean, it would be terrible.
[00:23:55.224 --> 00:23:56.066]  It would be a horrible thing.
[00:23:58.263 --> 00:23:59.264]  This is beyond that.
[00:23:59.925 --> 00:24:01.366]  And it just shows who they are.
[00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:02.086]  They're desperate.
[00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.348]  They've always used race to control and manipulate everybody.
[00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:08.012]  And they're the enemy of prosperity and everything else that's happening right now.
[00:24:08.772 --> 00:24:10.153]  It's miraculous what's happening.
[00:24:10.173 --> 00:24:11.034]  We should all give thanks.
[00:24:11.334 --> 00:24:12.135]  I give thanks to God.
[00:24:12.155 --> 00:24:12.916]  I give thanks to you.
[00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:16.599]  And I just want you to know we've blown Hillary Clinton's operation sky high.
[00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.441]  You've really devastated the globalists.
[00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:19.942]  You've done an incredible job.
[00:24:20.142 --> 00:24:20.583]  I love you.
[00:24:20.603 --> 00:24:21.343]  I appreciate you.
[00:24:21.403 --> 00:24:21.944]  It's amazing.
[00:24:22.344 --> 00:24:35.027]  And I'm going to really codify through the next few weeks, every day, just examples of the successes and the good things that have happened and just how much amazing things have gone on and how we stood up to the bullying and how we have rallies and half the folks there aren't white.
[00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:39.508]  That is so good because they always told minorities, you can't be part of the Tea Party or libertarianism.
[00:24:39.988 --> 00:24:44.469]  When it's been socialism and colonialism and collectivism that have absolutely enslaved everybody.
[00:24:47.392 --> 00:25:10.318]  Here we are at this great new renaissance that's happening and humanity's found its fight again and it's because of you and the great crew here and all of us little people standing up to Hollywood and mainstream media and the globalists and they've just thrown everything they've got at us and even though it's destroying the NFL and destroying the NBA and destroying Hollywood they just can't stop because it's all about the spiritual control they want because
[00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:13.499]  They're from the chicken shit dimension, basically, is what I call it.
[00:25:13.659 --> 00:25:14.179]  That's my term.
[00:25:14.219 --> 00:25:15.020]  The chicken shit dimension.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.540]  I invented that.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.063]  They just have it out for green fields and happy families and flyover country and people coming together.
[00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:25.565]  That's the will of evil, is to take things over.
[00:25:26.445 --> 00:25:31.806]  And then destroy it, and they wonder why they're so desperate, why they're so unhappy, why things are so terrible.
[00:25:32.087 --> 00:25:36.828]  If they could just pull down somebody that they think is better than them, then they would be somebody.
[00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:38.428]  And they're really projecting that.
[00:25:38.468 --> 00:25:40.049]  They're trying to pull themselves down.
[00:25:40.529 --> 00:25:46.931]  Because, if they weren't ugly before, they have become spiritually and physically ugly.
[00:25:47.651 --> 00:25:52.012]  Because they have gone into an economy of envy, and an economy of
[00:25:54.858 --> 00:26:02.140]  Class warfare, that even conservatives and libertarians claim we're not trying to be part of, but that permeates everything.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:20.805]  And then sometimes you have to fight that culture war with its own symbols, even though you realize that you're even playing into it at a certain level, but there's an equation where it does more good than bad, because you can't even communicate to people at a zombie level unless you enter into that paradigm of the false left-right system.
[00:26:21.845 --> 00:26:24.328]  But the truth is we're all children once.
[00:26:24.348 --> 00:26:25.449]  We all have hopes and dreams.
[00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.012]  We all have amazing ancestors from one point or another.
[00:26:28.032 --> 00:26:28.753]  We wouldn't be here.
[00:26:28.773 --> 00:26:33.679]  And we're going through a lot right now, through this process, like we're space traveling to Mars.
[00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:38.984]  And when you get to Mars after a year voyage, a lot of people wouldn't be able to walk or even hardly get up, like I said, getting out of the coma.
[00:26:39.845 --> 00:26:41.806]  And it's like that.
[00:26:42.107 --> 00:27:04.040]  We're in this artificial world now, going through all these changes, good and bad, and it's a great quickening and a great time of testing, and a great time for us to realize that the great destiny and continuum of humanity is the great arc of history, and the great arc of the future, and the great arc that ties us to the past, present, and through our dreams and genetic time flow to the future.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:12.521]  And so there is an eternal life guaranteed within the spectrum of life and knowledge and information we transfer forward.
[00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:26.444]  But that everything being multi-dimensional in God's master plan, there are other dimensions to that spiritually that also live on but resonate towards the energy and towards the force that it is likened to.
[00:27:26.844 --> 00:27:33.625]  So the hell is those that are evil and corrupt, vampires not having anyone spiritually to feed on together forever.
[00:27:35.464 --> 00:27:53.927]  And good is ever higher levels of joining with God as God opens up more and more of the universe to those that are able to grasp the face of God, then the mind of God, the soul of God, and the continuum of God as we join closer and greater with God.
[00:27:54.761 --> 00:27:56.342]  And these are the secrets they don't want you to know.
[00:27:57.082 --> 00:27:58.042]  And it's transcendent.
[00:27:58.602 --> 00:28:01.083]  So I love you, and I appreciate you, and I thank you.
[00:28:01.423 --> 00:28:02.583]  Celebrate your victories.
[00:28:03.244 --> 00:28:04.584]  Celebrate what you've done.
[00:28:05.064 --> 00:28:08.685]  Celebrate the commitment you've made, and where we're going together.
[00:28:09.346 --> 00:28:14.127]  Because I want to salute all of you, as I've always done, and thank you for what you've done.
[00:28:14.147 --> 00:28:18.869]  Because these globalist bullies think they can dominate and control humanity.
[00:28:19.689 --> 00:28:23.070]  But as I've said a thousand times, I don't know how all this is going to end.
[00:28:24.189 --> 00:28:26.290]  But if they want to fight, they better believe they got one.
[00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:28.191]  Because it's the fight that matters.
[00:28:28.752 --> 00:28:32.634]  It's the fight and the resistance is the destination.
[00:28:32.734 --> 00:28:34.415]  The journey is the destination.
[00:28:35.135 --> 00:28:36.476]  The journey is the destination.
[00:28:36.756 --> 00:28:37.897]  You are fulfilled.
[00:28:38.457 --> 00:28:39.338]  You are strong.
[00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:40.478]  You are beautiful.
[00:28:40.558 --> 00:28:41.399]  You are good.
[00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:43.140]  Hollywood tells you you're not.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.402]  The whole system tells you you're crap because you don't have these markings or these systems.
[00:28:47.502 --> 00:28:48.443]  It's a load of...
[00:29:06.562 --> 00:29:11.545]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified libtards on Twitter.
[00:29:11.645 --> 00:29:14.327]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[00:29:14.407 --> 00:29:20.390]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.731]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:31.096]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:34.038]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[00:29:34.458 --> 00:29:44.142]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[00:29:44.222 --> 00:29:47.463]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[00:29:47.563 --> 00:29:55.267]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:55.307 --> 00:29:56.327]  Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:56.407 --> 00:29:58.468]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[00:29:58.508 --> 00:29:59.748]  It was hilarious.
[00:29:59.768 --> 00:29:59.989]  They...
[00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:03.831]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:13.779]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:16.221]  This isn't like some pokey snake oil.
[00:30:16.821 --> 00:30:23.246]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[00:30:23.847 --> 00:30:25.468]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:32.939]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:35.142]  Well here I'm making another one right now.
[00:30:35.162 --> 00:30:36.644]  You're gonna get triggered over this?
[00:30:36.724 --> 00:30:36.984]  Good.
[00:30:37.224 --> 00:30:38.546]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[00:30:38.706 --> 00:30:43.432]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[00:30:43.712 --> 00:30:45.795]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[00:30:46.195 --> 00:30:48.576]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[00:30:48.937 --> 00:30:51.818]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[00:30:51.858 --> 00:30:53.399]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[00:30:53.459 --> 00:30:54.360]  BrainForce Plus.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.482]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:05.146 --> 00:31:09.468]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:31:09.849 --> 00:31:11.330]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:31:12.406 --> 00:31:17.009]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:18.970]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:20.971]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:26.234]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:31:26.434 --> 00:31:28.035]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[00:31:28.775 --> 00:31:33.839]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:34.760]  Secret 12.
[00:31:36.241 --> 00:31:37.101]  Optimal absorption.
[00:31:37.401 --> 00:31:42.105]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:31:42.525 --> 00:31:46.728]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:48.450]  Optimum levels.
[00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:53.715]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[00:31:54.036 --> 00:31:58.381]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[00:31:59.222 --> 00:32:00.503]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:02.145]  2017 has been a earth-shaking year.
[00:32:07.531 --> 00:32:10.093]  In 2018, guaranteed, it's even going to be wilder.
[00:32:10.593 --> 00:32:15.017]  In fact, my good friend Stefan Molyneux said it's going to be like the Battle of the Gods, Ragnarok.
[00:32:15.377 --> 00:32:17.019]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:29.729]  And that's why, thanking you for all your support, we are extending free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com into early January and the massive 50 to 67% off all our best-selling items.

[00:32:36.653 --> 00:32:41.476]  They're all massively discounted with free shipping at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:33:04.588 --> 00:33:06.109]  Infowars.com.
[00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:08.670]  You are the resistance.
[00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.492]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:16.314]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[00:33:16.334 --> 00:33:20.176]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[00:33:20.556 --> 00:33:22.537]  That I will faithfully execute.
[00:33:23.337 --> 00:33:24.638]  So help me God.
[00:33:24.658 --> 00:33:25.438]  Congratulations.
[00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.451]  Thank you.
[00:34:23.797 --> 00:34:24.418]  Yeah.
[00:34:57.153 --> 00:35:07.536]  What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[00:35:33.621 --> 00:35:48.312]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[00:35:53.996 --> 00:35:55.798]  We, the citizens of America,
[00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:07.696]  Are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[00:36:09.818 --> 00:36:17.642]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[00:36:19.203 --> 00:36:20.824]  We will face challenges.
[00:36:21.424 --> 00:36:23.085]  We will confront hardships.
[00:36:23.726 --> 00:36:25.707]  But we will get the job done.
[00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:33.435]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[00:36:34.555 --> 00:36:45.283]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[00:36:45.964 --> 00:36:48.245]  They have been magnificent.
[00:36:48.565 --> 00:36:48.966]  Thank you.
[00:36:56.485 --> 00:37:00.808]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[00:37:01.709 --> 00:37:10.075]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another.
[00:37:10.776 --> 00:37:18.562]  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:37:27.236 --> 00:37:37.378]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.
[00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:45.400]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:52.541]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[00:37:54.574 --> 00:38:00.138]  The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
[00:38:01.399 --> 00:38:04.421]  Their victories have not been your victories.
[00:38:05.081 --> 00:38:07.983]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[00:38:08.523 --> 00:38:19.571]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[00:38:25.416 --> 00:38:33.961]  That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment.
[00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:35.962]  It belongs to you.
[00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:49.409]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
[00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:51.150]  This is your day.
[00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.291]  This is your celebration.
[00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:59.578]  And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:15.445]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[00:39:19.989 --> 00:39:31.075]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[00:39:37.158 --> 00:39:42.521]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.031]  Everyone is listening to you now.
[00:39:49.711 --> 00:39:59.396]  You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[00:40:04.753 --> 00:40:13.783]  At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[00:40:14.604 --> 00:40:22.894]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:34.244]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
[00:40:35.124 --> 00:40:38.906]  But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
[00:40:39.826 --> 00:40:43.648]  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
[00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:49.210]  Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.
[00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:50.711]  of our nation.
[00:40:51.591 --> 00:41:01.134]  An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[00:41:02.815 --> 00:41:13.898]  And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[00:41:15.134 --> 00:41:22.440]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[00:41:31.567 --> 00:41:35.410]  We are one nation and their pain is our pain.
[00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:41.734]  Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.
[00:41:42.887 --> 00:41:48.993]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[00:41:50.635 --> 00:41:56.261]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[00:42:02.247 --> 00:42:16.832]  For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[00:42:17.992 --> 00:42:23.514]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[00:42:29.977 --> 00:42:30.637]  And spent
[00:42:31.539 --> 00:42:40.869]  Trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:53.363]  We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[00:43:02.543 --> 00:43:16.435]  I remember a little more than a decade ago hearing people talk about and write about probiotics and how we needed to supplement healthy bacteria in our gut to displace the bad bacteria.
[00:43:16.475 --> 00:43:18.016]  At first I thought it was a load of baloney.
[00:43:18.897 --> 00:43:30.667]  But as I talked to established brain surgeons and scientists and experts on autism and so many other subjects, I began to learn that the globalists are actually very aware of the fact that the gut
[00:43:31.857 --> 00:43:32.017]  Yes.
[00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:53.315]  Have a great day!
[00:44:10.755 --> 00:44:18.063]  Floralife by itself at 50% off the amazing Advanced Restoration 50 Billion Live Probiotics.
[00:44:18.684 --> 00:44:22.508]  We're offering sold out for six plus months because it's so hard to procure.
[00:44:22.948 --> 00:44:30.957]  MycoZX that targets the fungus, that targets the candida, that targets the mold.
[00:44:31.943 --> 00:44:33.084]  That takes over our guts.
[00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:38.406]  Because we know the good bacteria are being knocked out by the toxic food we eat.
[00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:42.228]  So it's good to replace those with a high quality source like floralife.
[00:44:42.868 --> 00:44:43.948]  But what about the fungus?
[00:44:43.988 --> 00:44:44.649]  What about the mold?
[00:44:44.669 --> 00:44:45.449]  What about the candida?
[00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:53.033]  It creates a literal slime wall in the intestines and it feeds on the nutrients before your body even gets it.
[00:44:53.413 --> 00:44:55.414]  Literally colonizing your body.
[00:44:55.854 --> 00:44:58.055]  Fungus has been known to colonize fruit flies.
[00:44:58.955 --> 00:45:00.637]  And other insects and other animals.
[00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:08.163]  It's been connected to killing massive numbers of bats and connected to all sorts of serious health problems and brain tumors.
[00:45:08.223 --> 00:45:09.564]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:45:09.784 --> 00:45:15.729]  We've only just begun to understand a little bit about what fungus and other things are doing in our bodies.
[00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:26.539]  And we know our gut does not need to be filled with this garbage that has filled out the niches of our intestines because the good bacteria have been driven for our body.
[00:45:27.159 --> 00:45:33.121]  So it's not enough to just have the floralife or another high-quality probiotic to replace your gut.
[00:45:33.141 --> 00:45:33.721]  That's critical.
[00:45:34.182 --> 00:45:43.325]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[00:45:44.144 --> 00:45:58.141]  That's why, at the end of the month of December into early January, we're offering Floralife at 50% off and free shipping, almost a loss leader, and Mico ZX, 30% off at infowarstore.com.
[00:45:58.481 --> 00:46:00.624]  You can also get the two products together.
[00:46:01.585 --> 00:46:05.208]  And get them at 50% off when you combo them.
[00:46:05.628 --> 00:46:10.772]  So this is my gift to the listeners for your gift for supporting us and making the Information Warfare victory possible.

[00:46:25.242 --> 00:46:26.343]  So going into the new year,
[00:46:26.883 --> 00:46:33.127]  It's more critical than ever to think about having a healthy gut, the gateway of nutrients and everything else in our body.
[00:46:33.548 --> 00:46:42.374]  And it all starts, not just with eating healthy, with a high-quality probiotic like Floralife, and with a high-quality anti-fungal, anti-yeast system like MycoZx.
[00:46:42.694 --> 00:46:44.555]  So popular, sold out for more than six months.
[00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:50.499]  Now back in stock for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.801]  Infowars.com.
[00:47:06.122 --> 00:47:08.043]  You are the resistance.
[00:47:15.528 --> 00:47:19.371]  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain.
[00:47:20.051 --> 00:47:25.855]  Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.
[00:47:26.896 --> 00:47:32.940]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:40.250]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[00:47:46.235 --> 00:48:00.787]  For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[00:48:01.963 --> 00:48:07.484]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[00:48:13.966 --> 00:48:24.748]  And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[00:48:26.317 --> 00:48:37.380]  We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:52.083]  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[00:48:53.482 --> 00:49:03.132]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[00:49:04.854 --> 00:49:06.195]  But that is the past.
[00:49:07.216 --> 00:49:11.241]  And now we are looking only to the future.
[00:49:20.911 --> 00:49:31.413]  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
[00:49:32.453 --> 00:49:37.994]  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[00:49:38.614 --> 00:49:45.555]  From this day forward, it's going to be only America first!
[00:49:46.256 --> 00:49:48.036]  America first!
[00:49:54.062 --> 00:50:06.214]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[00:50:06.895 --> 00:50:17.566]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[00:50:24.918 --> 00:50:28.339]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:37.802]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.
[00:50:43.563 --> 00:50:45.604]  America will start winning again.
[00:50:46.104 --> 00:50:48.465]  Winning like never before.
[00:50:52.748 --> 00:50:54.589]  We will bring back our jobs.
[00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.611]  We will bring back our borders.
[00:50:58.411 --> 00:51:00.393]  We will bring back our wealth.
[00:51:01.113 --> 00:51:04.255]  And we will bring back our dreams.
[00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:21.105]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[00:51:22.799 --> 00:51:27.061]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work.
[00:51:27.641 --> 00:51:32.523]  Rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[00:51:37.585 --> 00:51:39.805]  We will follow two simple rules.
[00:51:40.626 --> 00:51:43.767]  Buy American and hire American.
[00:51:48.283 --> 00:52:00.846]  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
[00:52:02.126 --> 00:52:09.728]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.
[00:52:09.948 --> 00:52:13.889]  We will shine for everyone to follow.
[00:52:18.266 --> 00:52:31.942]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:44.303]  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America.
[00:52:44.863 --> 00:52:51.911]  And through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[00:52:53.453 --> 00:52:59.520]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:15.776]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[00:53:16.757 --> 00:53:25.105]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
[00:53:26.566 --> 00:53:31.992]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:53:38.433 --> 00:53:39.734]  There should be no fear.
[00:53:40.615 --> 00:53:41.615]  We are protected.
[00:53:42.216 --> 00:53:44.497]  And we will always be protected.
[00:53:45.078 --> 00:53:50.501]  We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
[00:53:51.442 --> 00:53:58.147]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:54:05.586 --> 00:54:09.930]  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
[00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:17.536]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
[00:54:18.697 --> 00:54:28.005]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
[00:54:36.883 --> 00:54:39.684]  The time for empty talk is over.
[00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:43.585]  Now arrives the hour of action.
[00:54:49.147 --> 00:54:54.068]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[00:54:54.729 --> 00:54:59.750]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:01.551]  We will not fail.
[00:55:02.271 --> 00:55:05.132]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:23.531]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[00:55:24.412 --> 00:55:31.275]  A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[00:55:32.055 --> 00:55:36.696]  It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget.
[00:55:37.397 --> 00:55:46.440]  That whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[00:55:52.981 --> 00:56:00.849]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
[00:56:06.201 --> 00:56:26.710]  And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
[00:56:33.519 --> 00:56:43.631]  So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words.
[00:56:44.252 --> 00:56:47.416]  You will never be ignored again.
[00:56:52.754 --> 00:57:00.219]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:06.023]  And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[00:57:07.318 --> 00:57:11.119]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[00:57:11.779 --> 00:57:14.519]  We will make America wealthy again.
[00:57:14.939 --> 00:57:17.640]  We will make America proud again.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.740]  We will make America safe again.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:26.861]  And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:31.302]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:57:33.422 --> 00:57:33.922]  Thank you.
[00:57:35.603 --> 00:57:36.603]  God bless America.
[00:57:51.874 --> 00:58:02.227]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic flora life that is so critical.
[00:58:03.564 --> 00:58:05.784]  To having a healthy gut and a healthy life.
[00:58:06.184 --> 00:58:09.025]  And that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[00:58:09.505 --> 00:58:18.687]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[00:58:19.167 --> 00:58:28.628]  That's why as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the free shipping and 50% off on all our best-selling items while supplies last.

[00:58:51.574 --> 00:58:55.455]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:58:55.995 --> 00:59:03.397]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:59:04.098 --> 00:59:08.799]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:59:09.419 --> 00:59:11.320]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.361]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:18.622]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:25.966]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:59:26.566 --> 00:59:33.810]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:41.335]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:59:41.895 --> 00:59:42.975]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:59:43.336 --> 00:59:45.177]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:59:45.977 --> 00:59:48.960]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.

[00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:59.930]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:09.268]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[01:00:09.328 --> 01:00:14.412]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:17.295]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[01:00:19.318 --> 01:00:23.981]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:28.963]  From the front lines of the Infowar, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.484 --> 01:00:39.389]  It was 11 months and 10 days ago that President Trump was inaugurated the 45th President of the United States against all the odds and against the globalists.
[01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:44.672]  And we knew they were going to try to block his agenda and block Making America Great Again, but
[01:00:45.692 --> 01:00:46.852]  Trump has really come through.
[01:00:47.293 --> 01:00:48.473]  You have really come through.
[01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:51.814]  And none of us are perfect, but we're not out to get America.
[01:00:52.154 --> 01:00:53.555]  We're not out to get capitalism.
[01:00:53.575 --> 01:00:54.835]  We're not out to get Christians.
[01:00:55.215 --> 01:01:04.438]  We're not out to get anybody who wants to live and let live in Western free society and culture that again isn't perfect, but has been the Renaissance the last 400 to 500 years.
[01:01:04.698 --> 01:01:04.978]  That said,
[01:01:07.879 --> 01:01:17.903]  This hour coming up, we get into the real meat and potatoes of the live events and speeches and breakdown that took place 11 months and 10 days ago in D.C.
[01:01:19.223 --> 01:01:30.168]  Then in the third hour, we get into the Sunday show after I came back a few days later and really went through Trump's speech and more and made my predictions that have come true.
[01:01:31.115 --> 01:01:33.276]  So very, very powerful transmission.
[01:01:33.316 --> 01:01:41.498]  And it's key that we celebrate the victories we've had and be thankful to God, our families, to everybody that made it possible, including ourselves.
[01:01:41.538 --> 01:01:43.558]  So great job, everybody.
[01:01:43.998 --> 01:01:53.781]  And Bravo, no matter what color you are, where you came from, if you support free market capitalism and open, free society and really care about making America great again, we are all brothers and sisters together.
[01:01:53.821 --> 01:01:55.481]  So I salute you all.
[01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:56.962]  That said,
[01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:01.199]  I don't plug quite enough to fund our operation the way we need to.
[01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:09.542]  We really worked a lot harder in 2017 to bring in the same amount of capital we brought in just barely in 2016.
[01:02:09.742 --> 01:02:15.163]  That was a giant election year and record ratings, obviously, for Infowars.
[01:02:15.843 --> 01:02:17.564]  We grew, grew, grew to 2016.
[01:02:19.024 --> 01:02:20.345]  Doubled our audience that year.
[01:02:20.525 --> 01:02:24.466]  It dropped down some from that peak, but still, that was a new peak.
[01:02:24.906 --> 01:02:27.467]  Our new plateau was way above what it had been previously.
[01:02:28.752 --> 01:02:36.136]  But the audience under censorship and under attack, again, has been about 70% of what it was in 2016.
[01:02:36.596 --> 01:02:45.140]  And I want to continue the trend of the plateau to get back to where we were growing, because the globalists are really trying to shut us down.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:51.203]  So please spread the word, the articles, the videos, the live links, the podcasts, the free apps to everybody you know.
[01:02:51.523 --> 01:02:53.044]  It's that word of mouth that's unstoppable.
[01:02:53.324 --> 01:02:56.466]  And get great game-changing products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:57.706]  That's
[01:03:23.597 --> 01:03:29.683]  50% off when you get it with our amazing Floral Life Advanced Restoration 50 Billion Live Probiotic.
[01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:34.788]  This is the top of the line, highest quality probiotic out there.
[01:03:35.308 --> 01:03:43.716]  There are many other probiotics that are double, triple its regular retail price that are basically the same thing because they mark up high-end stuff way, way high.
[01:03:44.522 --> 01:03:45.082]  We don't do it.
[01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:05.111]  Well then, it's a lost leader.
[01:04:05.471 --> 01:04:08.615]  So, I want you to experience how great flora life is.
[01:04:08.835 --> 01:04:14.141]  That's something you regularly take just for good gut bacteria, because the pesticides kill the good ones, as you know.
[01:04:14.862 --> 01:04:16.764]  I mean, just 20 years ago, people laughed at probiotics.
[01:04:16.804 --> 01:04:19.347]  Now, it's admittedly one of the top sciences out there.
[01:04:19.387 --> 01:04:20.608]  It's just an absolute game changer.
[01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:24.112]  But what people aren't aware of is all the fungus, mold, and yeast that gets in the gut.
[01:04:24.933 --> 01:04:26.554]  And that's where MycoZx comes in.
[01:04:27.014 --> 01:04:30.495]  And I first took MycoZx when it was being developed a few years ago before it was even released.
[01:04:30.815 --> 01:04:35.417]  And it was so amazing what it did and the way it flushed me out and the way I lost weight and how healthy I was.
[01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:44.880]  I kicked myself just realizing the last time it sold out that I hadn't done another regimen myself because I'm just not somebody that was ever brought up with supplements and things.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.781]  It's something I've learned to do to be healthier.
[01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:48.201]  It's made my life so much better.
[01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:50.122]  So get free shipping at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:04:51.082 --> 01:04:52.883]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:04:52.903 --> 01:04:53.104]  Go ahead.
[01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:08.038]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:17.506]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:05:18.607 --> 01:05:21.950]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.710]  Absolutely.
[01:05:44.884 --> 01:05:58.133]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:06:07.939 --> 01:06:08.619]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.120]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:10.561]  You like him?
[01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:12.495]  That's good.
[01:06:12.595 --> 01:06:13.916]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:13.996 --> 01:06:14.416]  Nice guy.
[01:06:14.817 --> 01:06:22.524]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing is epic.
[01:06:22.564 --> 01:06:24.045]  Your reputation is amazing.
[01:06:24.505 --> 01:06:25.847]  I will not let you down.
[01:06:26.007 --> 01:06:31.352]  You will be very very impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking a lot but you'll be
[01:06:31.992 --> 01:06:34.213]  You'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[01:06:34.253 --> 01:06:36.915]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[01:06:36.975 --> 01:06:41.377]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.398]  He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.
[01:06:43.438 --> 01:06:44.799]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:46.480]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.581]  It was in Drudge, who's great, by the way.
[01:06:48.621 --> 01:06:49.881]  Drudge is amazing.
[01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:54.124]  But the story in Drudge and Big Story, it's all over the place now.
[01:06:54.844 --> 01:07:00.027]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff, shrugs, swimming across.
[01:07:04.624 --> 01:07:06.365]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[01:07:06.986 --> 01:07:07.766]  They're jumping in.
[01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:08.747]  They just jumped in the raft.
[01:07:08.767 --> 01:07:12.010]  They're coming up one, two, three, four.
[01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:12.991]  They have big satchels.
[01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:19.616]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:23.499]  Because they're showing this on camera, the guys carrying bags of stuff.
[01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:24.000]  It was rough.
[01:07:30.836 --> 01:07:33.437]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[01:07:33.477 --> 01:07:34.378]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:36.599]  You will be attacked for coming on, and we know you know that.
[01:07:36.639 --> 01:07:37.019]  Thank you.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.200]  Thank you very much.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.823]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:07:44.383 --> 01:07:45.884]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:46.364 --> 01:07:49.486]  Joining us now is Alex Jones from Washington, D.C.
[01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:49.726]  Alex?
[01:07:51.616 --> 01:07:52.276]  Well, thank you, David.
[01:07:52.296 --> 01:07:53.657]  Yes, it's an amazing print.
[01:07:53.757 --> 01:07:56.498]  I'm shocked that the guy's a listener, a big fan, and very famous.
[01:07:56.798 --> 01:07:59.119]  He's the official, you know, guy that does it for the Republican Party.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.161]  And, of course, the famous drawing of Ronald Reagan with a cowboy hat.
[01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:03.441]  That's him, but that's a side issue.
[01:08:03.822 --> 01:08:10.705]  I'm just going to take over here for about 10 minutes and hand the baton back to you guys, and I'm going to come in later in the 14-hour marathon broadcast with you guys.
[01:08:11.085 --> 01:08:17.128]  First off, let me just take a deep breath here and break down what just happened here today.
[01:08:17.388 --> 01:08:18.028]  Undoubtedly,
[01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:30.997]  This was Providence, this was American destiny being invoked, this was Trump declaring the birthright of this republic that George Washington talked about, and that Providence started back in 1776.
[01:08:33.338 --> 01:08:38.620]  He invoked it, it was so historical, and I knew they were going to invoke it, it just came into my mind.
[01:08:39.432 --> 01:08:45.506]  And I knew, even though he hasn't given a speech, and I haven't talked to Trump about this, I knew what was about to happen.
[01:08:45.567 --> 01:08:49.456]  And I said, I've got a tweet that they're going to re-invoke
[01:08:50.277 --> 01:08:51.138]  Uh, the birthright.
[01:08:51.218 --> 01:08:54.140]  I just feel it, because that's really what this is.
[01:08:54.641 --> 01:08:58.124]  And then the media was asking me, even the New York Times had seen the tweet, they said, did you talk to Trump?
[01:08:58.364 --> 01:08:59.845]  And how did you know it wasn't a speech nobody else did?
[01:08:59.865 --> 01:09:01.006]  And I said, no.
[01:09:01.366 --> 01:09:02.187]  This is Americana.
[01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:02.667]  Do you understand?
[01:09:02.687 --> 01:09:03.608]  We're reading the same book.
[01:09:03.648 --> 01:09:04.589]  It's the same spirit.
[01:09:05.009 --> 01:09:06.671]  So I will tell them when I talk about Trump.
[01:09:06.831 --> 01:09:08.012]  The spirit of America.
[01:09:08.232 --> 01:09:09.393]  Can you feel it rising?
[01:09:09.993 --> 01:09:10.854]  Trump feels it.
[01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:11.615]  He knows it.
[01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:12.576]  He loves it.
[01:09:12.936 --> 01:09:19.081]  And he wants to serve the people, and empower the people, and have America be incredibly wealthy again, and empower the globe.
[01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:25.633]  Back when we had 50% of the world's wealth just 30 years ago, we were sending more money to countries than we are now, and more industry.
[01:09:25.933 --> 01:09:30.716]  Now all we send is corporate, the ballistic monopoly men.
[01:09:30.896 --> 01:09:32.097]  They do not want us to be prosperous.
[01:09:32.157 --> 01:09:37.900]  And so, the message we heard in this speech has been my message for over a decade.
[01:09:39.016 --> 01:09:39.917]  I mean, longer than that.
[01:09:40.157 --> 01:09:42.619]  But this is Americanism versus globalism.
[01:09:42.639 --> 01:09:45.121]  So Trump isn't reading from my sheet of music.
[01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.543]  It's the sheet of music that's reality.
[01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.785]  And that's why it's so similar to what I say on the show.
[01:09:50.045 --> 01:09:51.206]  Don't you hear Trump say later?
[01:09:51.586 --> 01:09:53.408]  Okay, and yes, Trump obviously doesn't listen to the show.
[01:09:53.428 --> 01:09:53.848]  He told me.
[01:09:54.028 --> 01:09:55.649]  But let's just move past all that.
[01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:59.953]  What really matters here is that the people are so awake.
[01:10:00.013 --> 01:10:00.934]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:10:01.054 --> 01:10:03.716]  Every second person I walk by is a listener.
[01:10:04.176 --> 01:10:05.457]  I mean, it is blowing my mind.
[01:10:05.477 --> 01:10:06.417]  You've seen the live feeds.
[01:10:06.938 --> 01:10:15.722]  The amount of young people, the amount of teenagers that are listeners, this is indicative of the huge, incredible awakening that is happening on a planetary scale, not just here.
[01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:24.647]  So make no mistake, this revolution against globalism, this revolution against globalism is something that belongs to the people.
[01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:25.587]  And Trump said that.
[01:10:25.827 --> 01:10:27.308]  This revolution is about you.
[01:10:27.668 --> 01:10:28.749]  You are what empowers it.
[01:10:28.889 --> 01:10:29.889]  You are the future.
[01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.991]  And we're going to get out of your way and let you
[01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:40.753]  Have your destiny, have your dreams, and we understand America's special in that destiny, and that as America goes, the rest of the world goes.
[01:10:41.414 --> 01:10:44.539]  Washington envisioned all of this in his farewell address.
[01:10:44.579 --> 01:10:47.704]  He saw this in Providence, in a vision.
[01:10:48.539 --> 01:10:49.760]  And now it's all come true.
[01:10:50.061 --> 01:10:51.002]  The enemy knew that.
[01:10:51.042 --> 01:10:52.864]  That's why they always evoke the occult.
[01:10:52.924 --> 01:10:53.244]  Evoke.
[01:10:53.284 --> 01:10:54.646]  Don't talk about God or Christ.
[01:10:54.686 --> 01:10:55.667]  Don't talk about providence.
[01:10:55.987 --> 01:11:01.313]  Don't say, you know, America is great and all this stuff to demoralize us not to have this birthright.
[01:11:01.493 --> 01:11:08.780]  It's why they teach you in school how horrible, you know, the idea of American providence and manifest destiny and all of this is.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.063]  And talk about the problems and crimes associated.
[01:11:11.263 --> 01:11:14.025]  There's problems and crimes associated with any humans or any movement.
[01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:19.649]  But overall, the greater destiny to defeat tyranny worldwide and to stop a great evil in the future.
[01:11:19.989 --> 01:11:28.975]  I believe it's going to be this republic in the future that defeats the entire world government anti-human eugenics-based technocracy system.
[01:11:28.995 --> 01:11:30.436]  So, we're here.
[01:11:30.476 --> 01:11:32.757]  This is a giant victory for humanity.
[01:11:32.878 --> 01:11:33.778]  It is massive.
[01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:39.202]  And looking at Michelle and looking at Obama up on the Jumbotron,
[01:11:40.478 --> 01:11:47.482]  When they were singing the Star-Spangled Banner, Obama, with that arrogant, smug feeling that he's better than everybody, looked like he was dying.
[01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:57.047]  And a fake smile on his shoulder was frowning the entire time, because these are cult members who were put in power by the globalists so that they could help destroy the country and divide the nation.
[01:11:57.367 --> 01:12:01.229]  They are absolutely evil and want poor people not to have a future.
[01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:04.291]  That's why he goes to Africa and says, you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[01:12:05.225 --> 01:12:11.989]  Because he is literally there to hurt poor people across the board and they needed that face though as their cover to carry it out.
[01:12:12.309 --> 01:12:23.495]  Donald Trump right now is making hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs into Detroit, trying to get jobs into Atlanta, trying to get jobs into all these places in the Midwest as well.
[01:12:23.955 --> 01:12:26.977]  Very, very, very exciting stuff is happening.
[01:12:27.537 --> 01:12:34.021]  This is just an incredible time to be alive and I cannot, I cannot stress to everybody how historical this is because
[01:12:34.813 --> 01:12:48.561]  Everything the New World Order has done has been designed to bring this country down because they can't have a big, free, open, wealthy nation-state with a big, fat, middle-class, upwardly mobile people inside this impoverished, anti-human world government system they're establishing.
[01:12:49.161 --> 01:12:51.662]  The American system gives too much competition for them.
[01:12:51.722 --> 01:12:53.063]  They admit that in the White Papers.
[01:12:53.283 --> 01:12:57.065]  The British government 200 years ago wrote they couldn't compete with the American system.
[01:12:57.646 --> 01:13:00.007]  And again, the British now are throwing off globalism.
[01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:01.808]  They're throwing off these monopoly systems.
[01:13:02.754 --> 01:13:04.776]  So this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:13:04.936 --> 01:13:06.397]  It is an amazing time to be alive.
[01:13:06.417 --> 01:13:09.219]  And it is, quite frankly, so humbling and stunning.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:16.145]  The fact that we go through these crowds of people, people of every race, color, and creed are all just humans with red blood.
[01:13:16.545 --> 01:13:25.633]  This is breaking the will of the media that's trying to create racial division and trying to say that if you're not a white person, you can't, you know, have guns or private property or a future.
[01:13:25.933 --> 01:13:27.795]  You don't have the American birthright.
[01:13:28.155 --> 01:13:30.497]  You don't have a future of wealth.
[01:13:30.817 --> 01:13:32.037]  That's your enemy, that's racist.
[01:13:32.057 --> 01:13:40.439]  This is a cult programming to make people poor and make them the slaves of the globalists who all over the world will play different groups off against each other.
[01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:42.979]  If it's Ukraine, they'll play Catholic off against Orthodox.
[01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:49.040]  Or if it's a country in Africa, they'll play the Christians off against the, you know, the animists or the Muslims or vice versa.
[01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:55.062]  It's all divide and conquer because the elite are destroying nations trying to make us poor.
[01:13:55.122 --> 01:13:56.742]  So, America,
[01:13:57.694 --> 01:13:58.515]  We're good to go.
[01:14:15.362 --> 01:14:21.246]  began to come back from the dead in the last few months and now has come back to life.
[01:14:21.287 --> 01:14:28.392]  The phoenix is coming up right now and how powerful that phoenix is, how incredible that destiny is.
[01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:30.031]  It's up to us.
[01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:33.534]  We are what breathes life into the spirit, it into us.
[01:14:33.754 --> 01:14:35.635]  And the enemy knows everything's energy.
[01:14:35.896 --> 01:14:41.861]  You see, forget all the religious books and all the stuff you can hear from the preachers who are there to control the paradigm.
[01:14:42.361 --> 01:14:46.785]  The enemy wants to destroy our spirit, make us feel weak, so we don't take our birthright destiny.
[01:14:47.205 --> 01:14:50.168]  We're taking the destiny in our hands.
[01:14:50.468 --> 01:14:51.810]  We're breathing life into it.
[01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:54.152]  And those devil worshippers out there, the enemy.
[01:14:54.332 --> 01:14:55.914]  Chuckie Schumer, devil worshipper.
[01:14:56.635 --> 01:14:57.916]  Obama, devil worshipper.
[01:14:57.956 --> 01:14:58.536]  It's well known.
[01:14:58.737 --> 01:15:00.158]  These are devil worshippers.
[01:15:00.398 --> 01:15:01.660]  What's a devil worshipper?
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.941]  They want to hurt other people.
[01:15:03.001 --> 01:15:03.842]  They want to be number one.
[01:15:04.062 --> 01:15:05.443]  They don't want to see somebody succeed.
[01:15:05.924 --> 01:15:06.244]  Okay?
[01:15:06.564 --> 01:15:08.366]  What's somebody that wants prosperity and renaissance?
[01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:09.147]  They want wealth.
[01:15:09.327 --> 01:15:10.008]  A cornucopia.
[01:15:10.228 --> 01:15:13.471]  They're not jealous of somebody that's got a big house or a good-looking wife or vice versa.
[01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:16.694]  As long as you don't take something from me, I think your success is great.
[01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:25.463]  These people are devil worshippers and what happened today was the chief executive invited God back in and said, the door's open.
[01:15:25.923 --> 01:15:28.205]  And instead of the people, the door's open now to you.
[01:15:28.526 --> 01:15:32.490]  If you want this birthright, if you want goodness, we've all got to be good.
[01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:33.731]  We've got to come together.
[01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:38.469]  And we've got to, whether you're black heart, white people, you know, white heart, whatever!
[01:15:38.509 --> 01:15:44.693]  We've got to come together about issues that we stand for, what we believe in, and transcend all the control.
[01:15:44.713 --> 01:15:46.975]  The media pushed way too hard with all the race garbage.
[01:15:47.235 --> 01:15:48.596]  Now they're saying he's a Russian spy.
[01:15:48.616 --> 01:15:51.258]  Now they're saying they've got communiques with him and the Russians.
[01:15:51.318 --> 01:15:59.183]  And literally now, he tells, it's not just Maxi Waters, it's the New York Times now says that Putin actually told him Hillary was crooked.
[01:16:02.102 --> 01:16:11.566]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[01:16:12.146 --> 01:16:16.808]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:28.794]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[01:16:29.693 --> 01:16:43.082]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[01:16:43.882 --> 01:16:49.045]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[01:16:49.506 --> 01:16:50.967]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:52.649]  A lot of protein.
[01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:54.552]  You don't chew it properly sometimes.
[01:16:54.572 --> 01:16:55.213]  There's buildup.
[01:16:55.233 --> 01:16:58.899]  You can even rot inside your guts causing diverticulitis.
[01:16:59.079 --> 01:16:59.600]  You name it.
[01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:02.525]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[01:17:03.615 --> 01:17:11.099]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[01:17:11.619 --> 01:17:23.586]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:26.448]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[01:17:27.068 --> 01:17:31.071]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:33.313]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[01:17:33.754 --> 01:17:47.625]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[01:17:47.826 --> 01:17:51.629]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[01:17:51.969 --> 01:17:54.051]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[01:17:54.411 --> 01:17:59.235]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:02.437]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.659]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:15.468]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[01:18:16.589 --> 01:18:18.791]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:32.718]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[01:18:33.318 --> 01:18:42.484]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[01:18:44.033 --> 01:18:45.755]  This is the total win-win.
[01:18:46.276 --> 01:18:51.983]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[01:18:52.544 --> 01:18:56.970]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[01:18:57.290 --> 01:19:01.356]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best
[01:19:01.796 --> 01:19:02.777]  At the lowest price.
[01:19:03.278 --> 01:19:12.708]  Many probiotics out there don't even have caplets that bypass the stomach so it never even gets into the upper and lower intestines.
[01:19:13.269 --> 01:19:20.076]  Both of these systems have targeted delivery so it goes right through into the upper and lower intestine.
[01:19:20.937 --> 01:19:28.503]  We've tried several other formulas that were excellent, but this is, after two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:34.548]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[01:19:35.029 --> 01:19:39.693]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[01:19:40.293 --> 01:19:49.321]  Whether it's Floralife Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[01:19:50.413 --> 01:19:54.136]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[01:19:54.316 --> 01:20:02.182]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:20:08.828 --> 01:20:10.389]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.409 --> 01:20:12.531]  Because there is a war on.
[01:20:12.831 --> 01:20:13.752]  Or you're mine.
[01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:17.288]  It's not just Maxine Waters.
[01:20:17.428 --> 01:20:21.090]  The New York Times now says that Putin actually told him Hillary was crooked.
[01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:22.110]  That's right, America.
[01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:23.471]  You can't have your own idea.
[01:20:23.531 --> 01:20:24.511]  You can't have a strong leader.
[01:20:24.791 --> 01:20:27.232]  The Russians are the reason Trump got elected.
[01:20:27.432 --> 01:20:29.113]  And everything comes from the Russians.
[01:20:29.353 --> 01:20:30.473]  Everybody knows that's BS.
[01:20:30.513 --> 01:20:33.754]  Nothing against the Russians, but we... America invents a lot of stuff, too.
[01:20:34.094 --> 01:20:35.035]  We come up with a lot of stuff.
[01:20:35.475 --> 01:20:36.775]  Yeah, I mean, give me a break.
[01:20:37.235 --> 01:20:39.216]  You don't think we can't come up with crooked Hillary?
[01:20:39.716 --> 01:20:41.417]  Hell, somebody with a lobotomy can come up with that.
[01:20:41.717 --> 01:20:43.378]  Gotta be that smart to come up with crooked Hillary.
[01:20:44.901 --> 01:20:46.402]  So this is history happening right now.
[01:20:46.422 --> 01:20:55.047]  I'm going to skip this network break and David Knight and The Crooked Pop whenever they want here, but I'm going to go get settled down in an office and just take a shower or something and just get on my knees and pray to God.
[01:20:55.367 --> 01:21:01.310]  I'll be honest with you, I want to get in a room by myself and hit my knees and start crying because this is so good!
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.522]  If I'm telling you, man, the evil's gonna strike back.
[01:21:04.662 --> 01:21:05.482]  We gotta be watching them.
[01:21:05.702 --> 01:21:06.343]  We gotta be ready.
[01:21:06.463 --> 01:21:07.464]  But we know who they are.
[01:21:07.684 --> 01:21:08.564]  We know their plan.
[01:21:08.924 --> 01:21:11.086]  And I gotta say it, it's been InfoWars.
[01:21:11.426 --> 01:21:13.167]  It's been InfoWars and you, the people.
[01:21:13.587 --> 01:21:19.031]  And our analysis has led the way as the blueprint battle plan to blow the hell out of them.
[01:21:19.331 --> 01:21:20.832]  I'll tell you, people always want me to take credit.
[01:21:21.132 --> 01:21:23.754]  I'm a humble person, but we need to take credit just to know what we're doing is working.
[01:21:24.234 --> 01:21:26.876]  InfoWars and our guests and myself and you, the listeners,
[01:21:27.651 --> 01:21:31.434]  The eyes and ears on the ground and Matt Drudge and all of us together are the InfoWar.
[01:21:31.894 --> 01:21:36.197]  We are the blueprint of the operating system that just kicked the New World Order's ass!
[01:21:38.078 --> 01:21:38.759]  We got it!
[01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:43.922]  It's America 2.0, supercharged, ready, coming, committed!
[01:21:44.523 --> 01:21:48.966]  And our spirit, Trump sure is a thousand to one, and our president's even got the name Trump!
[01:21:49.306 --> 01:21:50.167]  So get ready!
[01:21:51.218 --> 01:21:54.279]  Yeah!
[01:21:54.699 --> 01:21:58.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.861]  Hey, what's the get in here?
[01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:02.521]  Hey, you guys feel the energy?
[01:22:03.782 --> 01:22:06.542]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[01:22:07.323 --> 01:22:08.403]  God bless you, sir.
[01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:08.963]  God bless you.
[01:22:09.123 --> 01:22:10.343]  God bless you.
[01:22:10.604 --> 01:22:12.424]  Hey, it's okay to love freedom.
[01:22:12.744 --> 01:22:13.584]  It's okay to believe.
[01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:14.425]  It's okay to be strong.
[01:22:14.945 --> 01:22:15.525]  Because here's the deal.
[01:22:16.503 --> 01:22:19.286]  We're not just getting hyped up by Trump and then feeling good.
[01:22:19.346 --> 01:22:20.367]  We have the tools.
[01:22:20.847 --> 01:22:21.648]  We have the means.
[01:22:21.808 --> 01:22:22.669]  We have the history.
[01:22:22.869 --> 01:22:23.710]  We got the pedigree.
[01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:24.451]  We got it all.
[01:22:24.791 --> 01:22:26.112]  Everybody here is America.
[01:22:26.573 --> 01:22:33.800]  And as long as you see the globalists bring people in, turn them against America, we're going to be able to bring a lot of people in once they're not getting brainwashed as soon as they get here.
[01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:36.122]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:22:36.162 --> 01:22:36.623]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:37.584]  I'm with Breitbart.
[01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:38.845]  What did you think of the speech, Jay?
[01:22:38.865 --> 01:22:39.926]  You really laid the wood to him.
[01:22:40.786 --> 01:22:46.631]  He laid the wood to them, but he empowered the people and let them know you are this revolution, you are the victory, and...
[01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:59.332]  He just brought what everything George Washington envisioned back, America 2.0, and just basically rebooted and launched the system, and it came out of there like a fiery phoenix, fire-breathing dragon.
[01:22:59.352 --> 01:23:01.473]  The globalists aren't crapping their drawers right now.
[01:23:01.713 --> 01:23:09.975]  This was pure Americana, and trailblazing, and science, and vision, and just absolutely empowering this country.
[01:23:09.995 --> 01:23:10.815]  He's under globalism.
[01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:18.033]  The decision was made to just shut us down and ship it overseas and parlay that into global power so some corporations could play God.
[01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.134]  But these corporations don't even have a vision or a spirit.
[01:23:21.494 --> 01:23:25.335]  It's just a bunch of empty guys up there claiming they're free market when they're not free market.
[01:23:25.595 --> 01:23:27.356]  They're about to see real free market.
[01:23:27.596 --> 01:23:31.817]  They're about to see the Republic get up off of its knees and it's happening now.
[01:23:32.117 --> 01:23:33.937]  America was reborn today.
[01:23:33.957 --> 01:23:40.319]  The spirituality of the speech, it was a very spiritual speech unlike a lot of the rally speeches.
[01:23:40.659 --> 01:23:41.279]  And I tweeted
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:45.365]  Right before, I said he's going to invoke the providence.
[01:23:45.385 --> 01:23:46.446]  He's going to invoke the covenant.
[01:23:46.887 --> 01:23:47.348]  And he did it.
[01:23:47.808 --> 01:23:48.629]  Because that's the key.
[01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:52.094]  Listen, I didn't even be that much of a religious person until I got deeper in and studied these people.
[01:23:52.435 --> 01:23:57.402]  They all understand that they have to get God out, not let us feel empowered, not let us know about America's destiny.
[01:23:58.084 --> 01:24:07.090]  George Washington said they need to kill that narrative because from their atheist or globalist view, from a psychological view, it gives us a culture that unifies us.
[01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:16.935]  So they've been killing our culture and then they've been bringing in this alien culture of everybody hating each other and fighting with each other and trying to bring us down, but then while they suck and sap our energy.
[01:24:17.196 --> 01:24:20.718]  So the second phase of slavery just fell today.
[01:24:21.158 --> 01:24:22.719]  Humans are trying to progress into the future.
[01:24:22.739 --> 01:24:24.160]  That's why they call themselves the progressives.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.080]  They're the opposite.
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:25.961]  They're not the progressives.
[01:24:26.613 --> 01:24:27.033]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:27.073 --> 01:24:27.833]  They're regressives.
[01:24:28.054 --> 01:24:29.554]  That's what the Jacobin Party was about.
[01:24:30.014 --> 01:24:34.596]  And that's what the Democrats were called, was the Jacobin or French Revolution Party.
[01:24:34.856 --> 01:24:38.637]  They wanted to regress everything and basically set up their own new tyranny.
[01:24:38.957 --> 01:24:42.538]  What you're seeing here is the real Renaissance and what you're seeing here is the real 1776.
[01:24:42.818 --> 01:24:44.979]  The last thing, sir.
[01:24:45.459 --> 01:24:53.882]  The subtext of Senator Schumer's speech about going into battle, was that a call to arms to the left to keep fighting?
[01:24:54.617 --> 01:24:58.774]  Yes, he was trying to get everybody to boo him so he could say, oh I came and I was nice and they were mean to me.
[01:24:59.915 --> 01:25:00.856]  Yeah, everybody slept through it.
[01:25:00.876 --> 01:25:02.157]  He was clearly putting the knife in, sorry.
[01:25:02.257 --> 01:25:03.458]  I'm like, you know, trying to twist it.
[01:25:03.878 --> 01:25:05.299]  People didn't really take the bait.
[01:25:05.319 --> 01:25:07.221]  I caught myself trying to take the bait and I went, no, no, no.
[01:25:07.581 --> 01:25:08.422]  He's trying to set us up.
[01:25:09.123 --> 01:25:11.725]  And, uh, then it just failed.
[01:25:11.765 --> 01:25:15.288]  It was just trying to bring back all this open old wounds and... Like in a mess?
[01:25:15.588 --> 01:25:15.768]  Yep.
[01:25:15.968 --> 01:25:16.388]  Big mess.
[01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:18.890]  Yeah, Donald Trump had a grand slam today.
[01:25:19.351 --> 01:25:23.895]  And, uh, Chuckie Schumer, or Chuckie Scammer, I mean, it just, it was a total foul ball.
[01:25:23.935 --> 01:25:24.775]  He just, he failed.
[01:25:25.055 --> 01:25:25.736]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:25:25.756 --> 01:25:26.717]  Alright, thank you so much.
[01:25:28.497 --> 01:25:29.017]  Still on here.
[01:25:29.397 --> 01:25:29.598]  All right.
[01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:30.358]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:31.318 --> 01:25:31.738]  God bless you.
[01:25:31.758 --> 01:25:32.958]  Anybody else want to get on team radio?
[01:25:33.958 --> 01:25:34.238]  Here, sir.
[01:25:34.258 --> 01:25:34.739]  Come on in here.
[01:25:35.059 --> 01:25:35.739]  Sharp-breasted fella.
[01:25:36.279 --> 01:25:36.899]  What's your name, sir?
[01:25:36.919 --> 01:25:37.719]  Marshall McGill.
[01:25:37.919 --> 01:25:38.339]  Marshall McGill.
[01:25:38.359 --> 01:25:38.999]  We'll talk to both of you.
[01:25:39.019 --> 01:25:39.339]  Take over.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.100]  Hey, hey.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:40.680]  You know what?
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.680]  Today was the beginning of something new.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:44.621]  We've been waiting for this for a long time.
[01:25:45.241 --> 01:25:51.822]  And, you know, the most important thing I saw today was that our president is putting back America first.
[01:25:52.422 --> 01:25:53.722]  We've been compromising.
[01:25:53.922 --> 01:25:55.463]  We've been putting everybody else second.
[01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:56.963]  We didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[01:25:57.023 --> 01:25:58.043]  We were politically correct.
[01:25:58.383 --> 01:26:03.624]  And today, our president says, America has nothing wrong with any other country putting themselves first.
[01:26:03.904 --> 01:26:05.485]  But we're going to put ourselves first.
[01:26:05.685 --> 01:26:07.765]  And we're going to focus on building our inner cities.
[01:26:07.805 --> 01:26:10.046]  We're going to focus on building our rural areas out west.
[01:26:10.366 --> 01:26:12.346]  We're going to be focusing on education.
[01:26:12.746 --> 01:26:16.407]  And most of all, what I got today was that our president says, we're going to put God first.
[01:26:17.227 --> 01:26:23.371]  And the Bible says in Proverbs 14 and 30 that righteousness exalts the nation and sin brings it down.
[01:26:23.451 --> 01:26:23.711]  That's it!
[01:26:23.751 --> 01:26:24.892]  He brought the power back in!
[01:26:24.912 --> 01:26:25.332]  There you go.
[01:26:25.572 --> 01:26:27.754]  We can't do anything without God.
[01:26:27.834 --> 01:26:31.035]  And when we put God first, nothing will be impossible for us.
[01:26:31.075 --> 01:26:37.279]  So the most important thing it is today, out of all the different agendas and so forth, was putting God first.
[01:26:37.499 --> 01:26:40.381]  And if we seek God first, everything else will be added to it.
[01:26:40.421 --> 01:26:41.942]  So I'm encouraged today.
[01:26:42.382 --> 01:26:43.543]  We're starting over.
[01:26:43.683 --> 01:26:48.665]  I'm encouraged today that we're putting God first, and I believe this nation is going to see a quick turnaround.
[01:26:48.926 --> 01:26:55.149]  I'm not talking about years and years, but we're going to see the first year seems like he's been in office 10 years because God's hand is going to be on it.
[01:26:55.349 --> 01:26:56.330]  You watch what God does.
[01:26:57.685 --> 01:26:59.206]  Listen, it's not mumbo-jumbo.
[01:27:00.026 --> 01:27:03.467]  They were very serious about this speech, but I could feel it when I was going in there.
[01:27:03.507 --> 01:27:09.109]  I said, I feel like Providence, he's going to invoke God and bring God back in and ask us to accept God.
[01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:12.291]  And that will just like fill the vacuum and push all this evil out.
[01:27:12.591 --> 01:27:14.372]  I mean, you take God out, evil pours in.
[01:27:14.592 --> 01:27:15.592]  You can feel it.
[01:27:15.832 --> 01:27:16.692]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:16.993 --> 01:27:17.413]  Absolutely.
[01:27:17.473 --> 01:27:24.315]  It's about who you pursue and wherever you pursue and wherever your aims are, that's where your energy and the power is going to come from.
[01:27:24.595 --> 01:27:25.696]  And we put God first.
[01:27:26.016 --> 01:27:26.957]  We're doing the day.
[01:27:27.177 --> 01:27:27.898]  It's just the beginning.
[01:27:28.078 --> 01:27:31.061]  It's not the night that's going to happen.
[01:27:31.301 --> 01:27:35.845]  But when we begin to pursue God, you know somebody said one time, if you can't run, walk.
[01:27:35.925 --> 01:27:37.507]  If you can't walk, then crawl.
[01:27:37.687 --> 01:27:39.229]  And if you can't crawl, just look that way.
[01:27:39.869 --> 01:27:43.152]  And when you turn your eyes that way, and God, He looks at us.
[01:27:43.172 --> 01:27:44.033]  Pretty soon you can crawl.
[01:27:44.053 --> 01:27:45.054]  There you go.
[01:27:45.074 --> 01:27:45.955]  Then you start walking.
[01:27:46.115 --> 01:27:47.076]  Then you start running.
[01:27:47.196 --> 01:27:47.897]  And then you begin to see.
[01:27:48.626 --> 01:27:50.988]  Absolutely, and I want to warn the elite, even if they kill Trump,
[01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:12.191]  The spirit is us, as we kept saying.
[01:28:12.551 --> 01:28:13.772]  It's already been opened up.
[01:28:13.932 --> 01:28:14.933]  It's already rising.
[01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:16.534]  And they're not going to stop it.
[01:28:16.594 --> 01:28:19.256]  All the world countries are trying to get off under the globalists.
[01:28:19.456 --> 01:28:20.657]  The globalists are very, very evil.
[01:28:20.677 --> 01:28:23.559]  And they're going to set up their world government that the Bible tells us about.
[01:28:23.759 --> 01:28:24.739]  These are evil people.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.661]  Yeah, we're living in the last days.
[01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:28.722]  We're living in perilous times.
[01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:34.087]  And the Bible says that the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violence is taken by force.
[01:28:34.407 --> 01:28:36.289]  We can no longer be passive.
[01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:40.853]  We can no longer just sit back and watch our country go to hell.
[01:28:41.114 --> 01:28:41.995]  We can't do that.
[01:28:42.055 --> 01:28:53.246]  We've got to stand up for what is right, and we've got to take our positions as men and women of God, not just for us, but we're going to be judged by what happens to the generations behind us.

[01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:10.597]  Gavin McInnes joins us, syndicated radio and TV host, former founder of Vice, you name it.
[01:30:10.677 --> 01:30:15.622]  But just, it's going into overdrive, the desperation with this Russia crap.
[01:30:15.662 --> 01:30:18.144]  And I used to laugh at it, but man, I'm not laughing anymore.
[01:30:18.184 --> 01:30:22.649]  They have intelligence committee hearings, House committee hearings, and they say, those are the Russian agents.
[01:30:23.823 --> 01:30:26.465]  No proof, no judge, no indictment, no FBI at my office.
[01:30:26.705 --> 01:30:29.887]  Just total lies, like saying I'm an Easter Bunny from Pluto.
[01:30:29.927 --> 01:30:30.847]  They never know when to quit.
[01:30:30.867 --> 01:30:31.688]  They're just getting crazy.
[01:30:32.048 --> 01:30:33.649]  Gab McInnes, what do you think's going on here?
[01:30:33.689 --> 01:30:35.770]  Well, we're seeing the progression of lunacy.
[01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:39.233]  I mean, over the past year, it started with fake news.
[01:30:39.793 --> 01:30:42.775]  And then I stopped saying that because it wasn't just fake, it was deranged.
[01:30:42.815 --> 01:30:44.536]  So I called it mentally ill news.
[01:30:45.056 --> 01:30:47.978]  And now, it's crazy ex-girlfriend news.
[01:30:48.418 --> 01:30:50.900]  Where she goes, I know you were with that Russian chick.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.461]  And you go, what are you talking about?
[01:30:52.481 --> 01:30:54.501]  I just went out for beers with Matt.
[01:30:54.922 --> 01:31:00.084]  Yeah, Matt was talking to someone else, talking to Alex, and Alex was talking to that Russian chick.
[01:31:00.304 --> 01:31:04.386]  So you're with her now, and you go, wow, you deluded lady.
[01:31:04.506 --> 01:31:05.987]  Please stop coming to my work.
[01:31:06.247 --> 01:31:09.228]  Please stop screaming at me about people you think I was with.
[01:31:09.508 --> 01:31:12.430]  Meanwhile, by the way, she's in bed with a Russian.
[01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:13.110]  Like, for all this
[01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:15.170]  Scrutiny, the left demands.
[01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:22.592]  You turn the tables to them and you point the mirror at them and we find out, oh, she's on Craigslist setting up Russian gangbangs.
[01:31:22.712 --> 01:31:26.012]  We've got Russians setting up ads on Facebook.
[01:31:26.032 --> 01:31:29.033]  We've got lies about the Trump prostitute, Dosset.
[01:31:29.333 --> 01:31:38.295]  So every time they get just a taste of what they put us through, they're exposed for the perverts and the colluders and the election riggers that they are.
[01:31:38.675 --> 01:31:39.055]  You're right.
[01:31:39.075 --> 01:31:41.257]  They've reached crazy ex-girlfriend level.
[01:31:41.277 --> 01:31:50.082]  The New York Post did a feature today about a threesome I had in 1994, saying that we're bragging about sexual encounters.
[01:31:50.382 --> 01:31:52.223]  Yeah, sorry I got laid when I was 24.
[01:31:52.543 --> 01:31:53.163]  I'm 47 now.
[01:31:53.844 --> 01:31:55.365]  Oh, the same thing.
[01:31:55.385 --> 01:32:00.207]  They're digging through everything in the world just looking for somebody to tell lies, and it's all like, Jones have a lot of girlfriends.
[01:32:00.888 --> 01:32:02.269]  I mean, it's like, what do they got?
[01:32:02.369 --> 01:32:02.669]  Nothing.
[01:32:03.129 --> 01:32:03.629]  Sorry!
[01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:05.951]  David Segal was in the news today.
[01:32:07.172 --> 01:32:09.634]  In 1991, he asked a woman to sit on his face.
[01:32:11.275 --> 01:32:12.756]  Oh my God!
[01:32:13.037 --> 01:32:14.097]  Stop the presses!
[01:32:15.198 --> 01:32:19.581]  I thought we were going through the normal stages of, what do you call it, death?
[01:32:19.662 --> 01:32:20.162]  Despair?
[01:32:20.442 --> 01:32:25.986]  Where it's denial, and then it's depression, and then it's anger, and it's acceptance.
[01:32:26.026 --> 01:32:27.267]  I forget the exact degrees.
[01:32:27.567 --> 01:32:30.790]  But we started out with those, but we didn't go to the next one.
[01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:34.892]  They just kept going on the crazy one, and it's gotten crazier and crazier.
[01:32:34.912 --> 01:32:36.192]  They're getting people fired.
[01:32:36.472 --> 01:32:37.593]  They're making up lies.
[01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:41.375]  I think the way it ends is riots.
[01:32:41.715 --> 01:32:44.836]  It really has to end there, because there's no rationale here.
[01:32:44.856 --> 01:32:46.077]  They refuse to talk to you.
[01:32:46.317 --> 01:32:48.278]  They hate free speech.
[01:32:48.298 --> 01:32:52.480]  They don't want to give Nazis a platform, and a Nazi is anyone that likes Trump.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.662]  So you go, well, I can't ration with you.
[01:32:56.702 --> 01:32:59.463]  You're out of your goddamn mind.
[01:33:04.062 --> 01:33:06.607]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[01:33:06.627 --> 01:33:10.835]  But the truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[01:33:11.616 --> 01:33:14.662]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:21.282]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[01:33:21.602 --> 01:33:25.363]  The war has happened within our hearts, within our souls, within our minds.
[01:33:25.843 --> 01:33:27.463]  We have to be good.
[01:33:28.123 --> 01:33:28.944]  We have to be pure.
[01:33:28.984 --> 01:33:29.804]  We have to be strong.
[01:33:30.144 --> 01:33:31.564]  We have to build prosperity.
[01:33:31.964 --> 01:33:41.406]  We have to bring every one of every race, color, and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail, who believe their divide and conquer would work.
[01:33:42.226 --> 01:33:44.707]  Yes, we've won the first phase.
[01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:49.855]  For the soul of humanity, has just begun.
[01:33:50.316 --> 01:33:56.848]  But, Obama, and Hillary, and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[01:34:12.143 --> 01:34:12.503]  I'm 1776.
[01:34:12.563 --> 01:34:15.067]  You're a white male!
[01:34:15.167 --> 01:34:19.592]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:34:20.434 --> 01:34:21.335]  Move, bitch!
[01:34:21.635 --> 01:34:22.797]  Get out the way!
[01:34:24.499 --> 01:34:28.524]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag...
[01:34:29.537 --> 01:34:30.978]  The American flag!
[01:34:31.058 --> 01:34:34.981]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:38.404]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:34:38.424 --> 01:34:39.966]  I will not let you down.
[01:34:40.046 --> 01:34:42.928]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:34:43.148 --> 01:34:44.769]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:34:44.789 --> 01:34:46.791]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:34:46.851 --> 01:34:52.276]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:34:52.376 --> 01:34:54.557]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:55.078 --> 01:34:56.099]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:34:58.696 --> 01:35:00.236]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:35:00.256 --> 01:35:02.517]  David Knight and the rest of the great crew are there in studio.
[01:35:02.537 --> 01:35:07.438]  I'm gonna talk to a few more people out here on the street, and then I'm gonna go get a little bite to eat, and then I'm gonna be back on.
[01:35:07.778 --> 01:35:09.898]  I really need to focus, write some notes, and just be very humble.
[01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:12.499]  Because this is a very special time.
[01:35:13.639 --> 01:35:16.780]  The evil that was getting ready to unfold, you thought things were already evil?
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:18.980]  They were about to launch the full evil.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:23.961]  Total takeover of the media, arresting patriots, torturing us, I mean the whole nine yards.
[01:35:24.741 --> 01:35:27.542]  And it was so horrible that even the intelligence agencies
[01:35:28.502 --> 01:35:29.503]  Just that we can't do this.
[01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:30.084]  This is crazy.
[01:35:30.104 --> 01:35:31.446]  It's like a comic book of evil.
[01:35:31.466 --> 01:35:32.668]  I mean, it's just so evil.
[01:35:33.549 --> 01:35:38.116]  You see movies, you read history books, both fiction and non-fiction, you think things like this can't really be happening.
[01:35:38.416 --> 01:35:39.638]  Till you see it happen.
[01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:43.793]  I mean, we saw a guy trying to get three llamas in this morning, past Homeland Security.
[01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:46.254]  And it's like, we have sick photos out there and no one will believe it.
[01:35:46.494 --> 01:35:47.395]  I'm going to put those up later.
[01:35:47.415 --> 01:35:49.695]  It's like a bomb and a llama or something.
[01:35:49.976 --> 01:35:51.296]  I mean, it's just so much.
[01:35:51.796 --> 01:35:53.517]  My point is, crazy stuff's going on.
[01:35:53.557 --> 01:35:55.097]  Roger Stone shows up in a huge top hat.
[01:35:55.538 --> 01:35:56.758]  He's been poisoned by polonium.
[01:35:57.658 --> 01:35:59.319]  We're living in crazy times.
[01:35:59.919 --> 01:36:01.660]  To the left, the right, all points of the compass.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.220]  It is wild.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.621]  Sir, tell us who you are and tell us what you think about this today.
[01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:07.300]  Nice to be here and nice to see you.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.641]  My name is Philip Thomas.
[01:36:08.701 --> 01:36:10.462]  I'm a naturalized American citizen.
[01:36:10.802 --> 01:36:12.403]  I lived in many parts of the world.
[01:36:12.463 --> 01:36:13.544]  I lived in Muslim countries.
[01:36:13.884 --> 01:36:18.967]  And I know how human rights are being violated.
[01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:21.708]  And people of other religions are treated like dirt.
[01:36:22.468 --> 01:36:23.689]  And this country is a great country.
[01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:26.411]  For the past eight years, we had a nightmare with Obama.
[01:36:27.331 --> 01:36:28.972]  And that nightmare is over today!
[01:36:28.992 --> 01:36:30.273]  Yeah!
[01:36:33.194 --> 01:36:38.336]  Yeah, as the other brother, the African-American brother said, a lot of quotation he gave from the Bible.
[01:36:38.697 --> 01:36:44.199]  You read Daniel chapter 2, you will find God is the installer and God is the remover of kings.
[01:36:44.519 --> 01:36:49.202]  Today, God had installed Mr. Trump as the president of this country.
[01:36:49.362 --> 01:36:49.762]  That's right.
[01:36:49.882 --> 01:36:52.223]  We voted, but nothing the enemy could do worked.
[01:36:52.283 --> 01:36:53.103]  It all turned against us.
[01:36:53.123 --> 01:36:53.764]  It was providence.
[01:36:54.324 --> 01:36:56.105]  I can't tell you the providence I've experienced.
[01:36:56.525 --> 01:37:02.168]  You know, my heart bleeds when I see the young people supporting Democratic Party, which is directionless.
[01:37:02.769 --> 01:37:05.030]  And now, you know what's happening with Democratic Party?
[01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:09.893]  They're trying to take Keith Ellison as the chief, and he is an Islamist!
[01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:12.414]  He wants to destroy United States!
[01:37:13.815 --> 01:37:14.935]  And Americans should wake up!
[01:37:15.676 --> 01:37:19.678]  If you don't wake up, you'll be in your slumber, and your slumber will lead to death!
[01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:26.387]  The Muslims have divided the world into two parts, Dar al-Harb and Dar al-Islam.
[01:37:26.727 --> 01:37:30.431]  Where Islamic rule is there, it is known as Dar al-Islam, which means House of Islam.
[01:37:30.692 --> 01:37:34.336]  And where there is no Islamic rule, it is known as Dar al-Harb, which means House of War.
[01:37:34.776 --> 01:37:40.443]  And the House of Islam should wage constantly war against the House of
[01:37:41.597 --> 01:37:45.720]  And so we have to be careful and Alex Jones is doing a great job
[01:38:02.834 --> 01:38:12.618]  I've been watching his videos on YouTube and my son who lives in India always calls and tells me, don't forget, don't, don't, don't neglect Alex Jones views.
[01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:15.679]  It's very important and it will save America.
[01:38:16.079 --> 01:38:16.679]  And I'm so glad.
[01:38:16.699 --> 01:38:18.400]  I'm going to lose all the huge listeners in India.
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.460]  Yeah, of course you have.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.682]  And the day after tomorrow, I'm flying to India and I'm going to be an ambassador for Mr. Trump.
[01:38:23.722 --> 01:38:23.902]  Great.
[01:38:23.922 --> 01:38:25.603]  But enough about me.
[01:38:25.623 --> 01:38:26.903]  Talk about where you see the country going.
[01:38:27.103 --> 01:38:27.383]  Pardon?
[01:38:27.663 --> 01:38:28.083]  Talk about me.
[01:38:28.103 --> 01:38:29.243]  I mean, talk about where you're going.
[01:38:29.263 --> 01:38:29.583]  Oh, sorry.
[01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:30.024]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:30.284 --> 01:38:33.204]  So, we have to be very careful about the Islamic agenda.
[01:38:33.684 --> 01:38:35.144]  You know, they say Muslims are all good.
[01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:36.485]  Oh, let them be good at home.
[01:38:37.385 --> 01:38:37.685]  Okay?
[01:38:37.965 --> 01:38:40.205]  But they want to destroy the United States.
[01:38:40.305 --> 01:38:43.386]  Outside the United States, they said America is a devil.
[01:38:43.566 --> 01:38:44.966]  But here, they say God bless America.
[01:38:44.986 --> 01:38:45.626]  It's taqiyya.
[01:38:45.966 --> 01:38:48.287]  There's an Arabic, there's a Muslim doctrine called al-taqiyya.
[01:38:48.347 --> 01:38:49.407]  Lie before your enemy.
[01:38:50.387 --> 01:38:51.387]  But hate them in your heart.
[01:38:51.987 --> 01:38:52.747]  That's what's happening.
[01:38:52.767 --> 01:38:56.208]  So, America should wake up and give an answer.
[01:38:57.782 --> 01:38:59.123]  I think America's starting to wake up.
[01:38:59.163 --> 01:38:59.403]  Yes.
[01:39:00.363 --> 01:39:04.306]  If they kill Trump, which I know they're seriously considering doing, I think it'll be an even bigger defeat for them.
[01:39:04.446 --> 01:39:04.566]  No, no.
[01:39:04.606 --> 01:39:09.048]  I don't think that will happen because our police, our military, our Secret Service, they're all strong.
[01:39:09.249 --> 01:39:09.809]  They're the best.
[01:39:09.829 --> 01:39:11.270]  I agree, but they're gonna try is what I'm saying.
[01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:12.250]  Oh yeah, of course, yes.
[01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:14.872]  Yes, of course, they'll try, but they'll try being vain.
[01:39:15.732 --> 01:39:16.933]  But Trump will triumph!
[01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:21.112]  Jesus will protect, Jesus will protect, yes.
[01:39:21.532 --> 01:39:31.460]  Because God is the installer and Yahweh has installed Mr. Trump to become the president of this greatest nation and the most, the greatest superpower ever in the history of mankind.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:40.388]  So I'm so glad to be here and if you want some more, some more, some more, some of my views, I can tell you what, you know, America should become strong.
[01:39:40.648 --> 01:39:43.990]  A strong America is the one which will stop Islamization of this world.
[01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:44.951]  Well, let's talk about this.
[01:39:45.492 --> 01:39:46.573]  I mean, look at how
[01:39:47.845 --> 01:39:50.367]  Look at how the globalists are so upset right now.
[01:39:50.467 --> 01:39:51.607]  They can tell the tide's turning.
[01:39:51.867 --> 01:39:52.848]  Q, I gotta get your view.
[01:39:52.908 --> 01:39:53.648]  You saw this thing.
[01:39:53.668 --> 01:39:53.949]  Get over here.
[01:39:53.969 --> 01:39:54.889]  No, you're getting on air.
[01:39:55.449 --> 01:39:57.050]  I'm sorry, you're getting on air.
[01:39:57.331 --> 01:39:57.811]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:57.931 --> 01:39:58.891]  Thank you very much.
[01:39:59.172 --> 01:40:00.172]  Here, we'll interview the back of his head.
[01:40:00.192 --> 01:40:01.053]  What do you think about the situation?
[01:40:01.693 --> 01:40:02.594]  Hey, Zimmerman, you get in there.
[01:40:02.614 --> 01:40:03.334]  I didn't know Zimmerman was here.
[01:40:03.674 --> 01:40:04.395]  Go ahead, Zimmerman.
[01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:05.055]  Tell us what you think.
[01:40:05.315 --> 01:40:07.957]  This entire inauguration has been extremely historic, obviously.
[01:40:08.457 --> 01:40:11.018]  And just seeing the energy... Nothing historic.
[01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:11.799]  Completely.
[01:40:12.099 --> 01:40:14.500]  Seeing the energy... A seismic pole shift.
[01:40:14.881 --> 01:40:17.022]  A supernova of enlightenment.
[01:40:17.762 --> 01:40:19.764]  A title release of the Titans of Liberty!
[01:40:20.044 --> 01:40:20.364]  Yeah!
[01:40:20.605 --> 01:40:21.105]  Yeah!
[01:40:21.125 --> 01:40:23.067]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:24.248 --> 01:40:30.633]  The look people had going in this morning was obviously already high energy, but just leaving today, seeing all the people leaving, they're re-energized.
[01:40:30.673 --> 01:40:33.735]  They're rejuvenated and like ready to make America great again.
[01:40:34.456 --> 01:40:35.037]  Absolutely.
[01:40:35.137 --> 01:40:38.179]  And again, it's not that the Republican establishment's out to get Trump.
[01:40:38.259 --> 01:40:40.281]  I hate the Republican establishment, but so are the Democrats.
[01:40:40.361 --> 01:40:42.823]  It's so obvious that he's anti-new world order and awesome.
[01:40:43.083 --> 01:40:43.704]  You're awesome.
[01:40:44.224 --> 01:40:44.905]  Come on here on air.
[01:40:46.175 --> 01:40:47.216]  I made it here!
[01:40:47.276 --> 01:40:47.836]  Well, you're awesome.
[01:40:47.856 --> 01:40:49.417]  Oh my God, I love you!
[01:40:49.437 --> 01:40:49.858]  You're awesome.
[01:40:49.998 --> 01:40:50.438]  You're awesome.
[01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:51.499]  Here, talk to folks out there.
[01:40:51.519 --> 01:40:51.939]  Come on, Steph.
[01:40:51.959 --> 01:40:52.740]  Here, talk to folks out there.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.781]  I have my InfoWars right now here.
[01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:56.382]  Oh, you got your InfoWars live.
[01:40:56.402 --> 01:40:56.802]  Thank you.
[01:40:56.862 --> 01:40:59.184]  Oh my God, somebody take a picture of me, please.
[01:40:59.204 --> 01:41:00.645]  What do you think about the whole inauguration?
[01:41:01.245 --> 01:41:07.029]  I'm, like, so... I'm, like, my heart is so happy.
[01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:07.630]  I just...
[01:41:08.323 --> 01:41:09.123]  I just love this.
[01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:10.864]  I love Mr. Trump.
[01:41:11.144 --> 01:41:14.965]  I met him in 2013, and he is such a good person.
[01:41:15.765 --> 01:41:21.127]  And when I found out he was running, I had to run down and fly down to Miami.
[01:41:21.767 --> 01:41:23.848]  And he has such a good heart.
[01:41:24.088 --> 01:41:25.148]  He is not a racist.
[01:41:25.268 --> 01:41:26.469]  He loves this country.
[01:41:26.789 --> 01:41:30.410]  And he just wants to unite us, just like he said in the speech.
[01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:32.310]  We all bleed red.
[01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:33.691]  Every one of us.
[01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:36.191]  White, black, Hispanic.
[01:41:38.838 --> 01:41:48.023]  Um, Japanese, whoever you are, we are all red, and we are patriots, and I love Alex Jones because he's the only one I listen to.
[01:41:48.823 --> 01:41:49.684]  Well, thanks for coming.
[01:41:49.704 --> 01:41:50.244]  It was awesome.
[01:41:50.524 --> 01:41:51.285]  History happened.
[01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:53.105]  I was gonna bring my son, but it's just too dangerous.
[01:41:53.586 --> 01:41:54.666]  They were attacking women.
[01:41:55.167 --> 01:41:56.587]  I mean, all the women were coming by bleeding.
[01:41:56.627 --> 01:41:57.288]  I go, what's going on?
[01:41:57.328 --> 01:41:58.048]  Women on crutches.
[01:41:58.448 --> 01:42:01.070]  Old ladies are like, they're beating us up trying to get in.
[01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:02.310]  The leftists down there.
[01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:03.691]  And I went down there and they attacked us.
[01:42:04.534 --> 01:42:06.316]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell?
[01:42:06.636 --> 01:42:07.797]  And they really go, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi!
[01:42:07.877 --> 01:42:09.719]  And I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?
[01:42:09.739 --> 01:42:11.080]  They're like, Putin's a Nazi!
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:11.881]  I'm like, it's the Russians!
[01:42:12.321 --> 01:42:13.423]  Beat the Nazis, dumbass!
[01:42:13.863 --> 01:42:15.044]  They just don't know anything!
[01:42:15.665 --> 01:42:18.287]  They just have no historical... They just believe MSNBC!
[01:42:18.627 --> 01:42:28.016]  I'll tell ya, only a few thousand of the protesters, millions of people away, and your BS is coming to an end, so... Yeah!
[01:42:28.236 --> 01:42:28.517]  Yeah!
[01:42:30.731 --> 01:42:31.272]  1776 worldwide.
[01:42:31.372 --> 01:42:32.532]  Alright, listen, guys.
[01:42:33.612 --> 01:42:35.493]  David Knight, you guys can pop in whenever you want here.
[01:42:35.513 --> 01:42:36.393]  David, what do you think of all this?
[01:42:36.673 --> 01:42:37.754]  Leanne, everybody.
[01:42:38.374 --> 01:42:46.917]  Well, you know, Alex, listening to the preachers that have been there and the other crowd that have been there, I think it's pretty important to go back and look at what Franklin Graham said.
[01:42:46.937 --> 01:42:52.899]  You know, he said in the Bible, as he got up and spoke, he said, the Bible, rain is a sign of God's blessing, and it started to rain when he came to the platform.
[01:43:01.525 --> 01:43:04.409]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[01:43:04.489 --> 01:43:13.522]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:43:13.642 --> 01:43:14.843]  So what do we do about it?
[01:43:15.004 --> 01:43:18.148]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:43:18.328 --> 01:43:25.934]  Fight back with the all new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.

[01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:54.911]  It's the real deal.
[01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:56.651]  Brain Force Plus.

[01:44:01.813 --> 01:44:09.816]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States, powerful 50 billion live organism, probiotic, floralife,
[01:44:10.891 --> 01:44:12.137]  That is so critical.
[01:44:13.496 --> 01:44:18.957]  To having a healthy gut and a healthy life, and that has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[01:44:19.437 --> 01:44:28.600]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:38.562]  That's why, as we go through Christmas and now into the new year, we're extending the free shipping and 50% off on all our best-selling items while supplies last.
[01:44:38.882 --> 01:44:41.023]  You can also get the two products together
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.340]  Just briefly,
[01:45:12.555 --> 01:45:14.557]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:45:14.577 --> 01:45:15.457]  He's about to retire.
[01:45:15.477 --> 01:45:22.563]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:45:22.603 --> 01:45:25.565]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:45:25.605 --> 01:45:26.585]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:45:27.106 --> 01:45:28.187]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:45:28.747 --> 01:45:31.209]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:32.030]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:34.431]  This is Grignard Reagents Heavy Metals.
[01:45:34.651 --> 01:45:40.356]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:45:40.936 --> 01:45:41.417]  Exactly.
[01:45:41.477 --> 01:45:47.463]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:45:47.504 --> 01:45:51.308]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:56.193]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:45:57.176 --> 01:45:57.596]  I don't
[01:46:13.968 --> 01:46:17.530]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:19.191]  Why does it say nursery water?
[01:46:19.211 --> 01:46:20.492]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[01:46:20.512 --> 01:46:23.414]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:46:23.434 --> 01:46:25.415]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:25.615 --> 01:46:35.361]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[01:46:35.941 --> 01:46:37.162]  But you die without iodine.
[01:46:37.182 --> 01:46:38.743]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:46:38.763 --> 01:46:40.524]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:46:40.564 --> 01:46:41.504]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:46:41.524 --> 01:46:42.585]  This is the real metaphor.
[01:46:42.705 --> 01:46:43.245]  Great.
[01:46:43.505 --> 01:46:51.648]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:46:52.248 --> 01:46:55.170]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:47:14.133 --> 01:47:16.294]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:16.795 --> 01:47:21.938]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:23.782 --> 01:47:25.604]  I'm here with Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.624 --> 01:47:30.507]  We're celebrating one of the most historic things that ever happened in the United States of America.
[01:47:30.547 --> 01:47:32.749]  We actually got the power back to the people.
[01:47:32.769 --> 01:47:34.530]  Donald Trump gave us that power today.
[01:47:35.511 --> 01:47:36.451]  And God blessed us.
[01:47:36.471 --> 01:47:37.492]  God blessed America.
[01:47:37.592 --> 01:47:38.833]  God blessed Donald Trump today.
[01:47:39.193 --> 01:47:43.116]  And I just thank God for you, Alex Jones, for helping to wake so many people up.
[01:47:43.296 --> 01:47:44.977]  You don't realize how many people you touched.
[01:47:45.218 --> 01:47:46.899]  I've been listening to you for over a decade.
[01:47:47.498 --> 01:47:48.219]  Absolutely!
[01:47:48.239 --> 01:47:48.519]  Thank you!
[01:47:48.619 --> 01:47:48.839]  Thank you!
[01:47:48.859 --> 01:47:49.680]  Great job!
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.260]  God bless you!
[01:48:03.069 --> 01:48:10.836]  What's happening here is the globalists got so delusional that all their hate and all their lies and all their disinfo didn't turn people the way they thought it turned them away from them.
[01:48:11.157 --> 01:48:14.480]  They have become insane and they can't admit they're failing on every front.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.202]  And Trump has said he's changed the last few years.
[01:48:17.583 --> 01:48:18.784]  I have too, but so has everybody else.
[01:48:19.304 --> 01:48:20.365]  It's like the hundred monkeys thing.
[01:48:20.385 --> 01:48:33.979]  If you want to not believe in spirit or sixth sense that's been proven, it's that they'll have like an island with monkeys 20 miles away, the same species, and as soon as a certain number of monkeys on one island learn something, they don't know why suddenly the other one's 20 miles away learning.
[01:48:34.488 --> 01:48:38.809]  And so there's something going on and it's like, it's the invisible human internet.
[01:48:39.010 --> 01:48:41.330]  And so right now, Trump is growing too.
[01:48:41.911 --> 01:48:45.072]  And Trump is, imagine all the stuff he's getting hit by in the discernment.
[01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:48.173]  And he's asking God for providence and to lead God and direct him.
[01:48:48.193 --> 01:48:53.854]  Imagine what he's going to be given just as George Washington grew, grew, grew with all the discernment he was given.
[01:48:54.535 --> 01:48:54.995]  Come on, ma'am.
[01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.155]  Come on in here, whoever wants to get in here.
[01:48:56.395 --> 01:48:58.776]  And I'm going to hand the baton over right now for the next 15 minutes.
[01:48:58.816 --> 01:49:00.257]  David Knight, you guys will be over in a minute.
[01:49:00.697 --> 01:49:01.217]  Come on in here, sir.
[01:49:05.681 --> 01:49:17.492]  I just want to say it's an amazing experience being here and finally having a previous regime end and be given the truth and a new light by Alex and all the people in the new media.
[01:49:18.092 --> 01:49:21.475]  And I just unabashedly plug DNA Air Force.
[01:49:22.997 --> 01:49:23.998]  Buy a True Selenium.
[01:49:24.158 --> 01:49:25.018]  Please buy the products.
[01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:25.839]  They're fantastic.
[01:49:26.039 --> 01:49:27.301]  And I know you don't plug enough.
[01:49:28.163 --> 01:49:29.604]  So just buy and support the freedom.
[01:49:29.985 --> 01:49:32.667]  We're crushing the old stream media and it's a new dawn.
[01:49:32.687 --> 01:49:33.288]  It's a new era.
[01:49:33.748 --> 01:49:34.429]  It's exciting.
[01:49:34.509 --> 01:49:36.211]  I can't believe it's over.
[01:49:36.791 --> 01:49:37.152]  I like that.
[01:49:37.172 --> 01:49:38.052]  The old stream media.
[01:49:38.092 --> 01:49:38.573]  It's the era of Trump.
[01:49:38.593 --> 01:49:39.414]  It's the era of the people.
[01:49:39.454 --> 01:49:41.115]  It's the era of a new America.
[01:49:41.956 --> 01:49:42.577]  Beautiful, brother.
[01:49:42.857 --> 01:49:43.177]  Beautiful.
[01:49:43.197 --> 01:49:43.838]  All right, guys.
[01:49:43.938 --> 01:49:45.620]  Anybody else want to hand the baton back to our crew?
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:46.680]  All right, run on in here.
[01:49:47.101 --> 01:49:49.243]  Come on in.
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:57.766]  I'm a college student and I just want to say it's been incredible to watch how much the political landscape has changed in the last couple of months.
[01:49:57.846 --> 01:50:10.395]  Just being able to express yourself has been something that we've been unable to do because as soon as you say something, you're labeled, you're attacked, and it's a way of controlling our speech.
[01:50:10.942 --> 01:50:12.363]  And it's a way of controlling us.
[01:50:12.803 --> 01:50:15.024]  And it's just been amazing to see that shift change.
[01:50:15.064 --> 01:50:17.906]  And it's important that young people start to get involved.
[01:50:17.946 --> 01:50:23.509]  And we start fighting back against this political correctness that has completely destroyed academia.
[01:50:24.829 --> 01:50:26.090]  I mean, it's been another nightmare.
[01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:28.271]  It's been to destroy every thought, absolutely.
[01:50:28.771 --> 01:50:31.693]  Well, and it's important that we start fighting back because that's all we have.
[01:50:31.753 --> 01:50:34.114]  We need to be autonomous and independent.
[01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.995]  And we need to think analytically and critically.
[01:50:36.505 --> 01:50:38.445]  And if we do that, we'll be more informed.
[01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:39.026]  Hey, I love you guys.
[01:50:39.046 --> 01:50:39.866]  I gotta roll out.
[01:50:39.886 --> 01:50:40.446]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:40.526 --> 01:50:43.807]  Alright, anybody else want to say something?
[01:50:43.827 --> 01:50:45.687]  I just want to say one thing real quick.
[01:50:45.707 --> 01:50:52.148]  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Southeast, regional office, and I worked against the GOP to support Trump.
[01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:58.249]  There were a lot of people that were just not on board for Trump where I work, and it was all volunteer.
[01:50:58.289 --> 01:51:00.630]  We grassroots Pennsylvania, so.
[01:51:02.359 --> 01:51:03.181]  And I PA for Trump.
[01:51:07.859 --> 01:51:08.139]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:08.219 --> 01:51:09.039]  Well, continue.
[01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:09.600]  How's it going?
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:12.480]  This is Glenn Zarmanoff reporting live from Washington, D.C.
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:13.661]  We are Change, New Jersey.
[01:51:14.021 --> 01:51:15.481]  Jersey City for 9-11 Truth.
[01:51:15.841 --> 01:51:18.922]  I've been in the info war since 2001, since I found Alex Jones.
[01:51:19.402 --> 01:51:22.883]  Of course, I was already awake to 9-11 Truth before that, because I'm a 9-11 eyewitness.
[01:51:23.203 --> 01:51:31.166]  You can please check out my YouTube channel, Glenn Zarmanoff, G-L-E-N-N-Z-A-R-M-A-N-O-V, and you can find the five terabytes that came out in 2010.
[01:51:32.526 --> 01:51:35.288]  Declassified from NIST that they withheld intentionally.
[01:51:35.308 --> 01:51:42.354]  5,000 gigabytes of previously kept secret videos and photos from 9-11 that proves the whole thing is an inside job.
[01:51:42.714 --> 01:51:46.437]  Before we had speculation and conjecture, now we have 5 terabytes.
[01:51:46.497 --> 01:51:47.098]  Please check it out.
[01:51:47.118 --> 01:51:47.798]  Glenn Zarminov.
[01:51:48.318 --> 01:51:49.119]  Thanks, Glenn.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.921]  Hey guys, I'm running low on batteries.
[01:51:52.061 --> 01:51:54.764]  Maybe like two more people and then we'll have to end it.
[01:51:54.804 --> 01:51:56.605]  But here's another fine fellow who came up.
[01:51:56.625 --> 01:51:57.025]  Here you go, sir.
[01:51:57.326 --> 01:51:57.726]  Oh, hi.
[01:51:58.046 --> 01:51:58.687]  I'm Will Cody.
[01:51:59.027 --> 01:52:00.908]  I'm just walking down there from the rally, right?
[01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.629]  Coming over here?
[01:52:02.085 --> 01:52:12.651]  And these like, these Antifa guys, or I don't know what, they're like, they're wearing black, they have like bandanas on, you know, all black, they're carrying a big flag with a hammer and sickle on it, and they like, they spit on me, like.
[01:52:12.671 --> 01:52:13.012]  Ugh.
[01:52:13.892 --> 01:52:16.754]  It's terrible, like they're all radicalized there, people are, it's terrible.
[01:52:17.094 --> 01:52:17.755]  They're disgusting.
[01:52:17.895 --> 01:52:19.816]  Alright man, thanks a lot.
[01:52:20.296 --> 01:52:25.019]  Uh, it looks like the crowd has dissipated as soon as Alex Jones walked off, and um,
[01:52:25.808 --> 01:52:26.989]  So I'm going to throw it back to you guys.
[01:52:27.049 --> 01:52:28.330]  I'm running low on battery anyways.
[01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:31.471]  This is Rob Doo reporting from just outside the capitals right over there.
[01:52:31.491 --> 01:52:34.913]  And that's where they swore in Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.
[01:52:34.933 --> 01:52:36.154]  We've got some live footage here.
[01:52:36.174 --> 01:52:37.755]  We're already clashing with police.
[01:52:37.935 --> 01:52:42.898]  This is Fox News showing tear gas being fired at people and protesters attacking people.
[01:52:42.938 --> 01:52:48.341]  Because, you know, we cannot have a peaceful transition of power if these brats don't get their way.
[01:52:48.802 --> 01:52:49.642]  They do whatever they want.
[01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:51.063]  These are the children of Obama.
[01:52:51.083 --> 01:52:54.205]  These are people who, like Obama, don't respect the democratic process.
[01:52:54.705 --> 01:52:58.388]  He didn't get what he wanted from our elected representative, so he just did executive orders.
[01:52:58.688 --> 01:53:01.069]  These people don't get what they want out of the election, so what do they do?
[01:53:01.089 --> 01:53:03.951]  They take to the streets, they attack people, and call it free speech.
[01:53:04.031 --> 01:53:04.612]  No, it's not.
[01:53:04.972 --> 01:53:06.333]  Let's call it what it is, okay?
[01:53:06.373 --> 01:53:08.975]  They're setting fire to a crowded theater.
[01:53:09.055 --> 01:53:14.278]  This is what these people are doing, and they need to be shut down, and so this is a back and forth.
[01:53:15.319 --> 01:53:17.940]  Protesters just threw it back at the police there.
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:20.981]  I guess they deployed some to disperse the crowd.
[01:53:21.922 --> 01:53:23.562]  But obviously things are already getting wild.
[01:53:23.602 --> 01:53:25.183]  The parade hasn't even started.
[01:53:25.623 --> 01:53:29.725]  And they had been planning these protests to go all along the parade route today.
[01:53:30.185 --> 01:53:35.987]  Of course, there's about 8,000 people participating in this parade with all of these Antifa people here on the sides.
[01:53:36.267 --> 01:53:40.849]  And of course, Donald Trump said he was going to be handing the power back to the people, but I don't think he meant these people.
[01:53:41.089 --> 01:53:45.873]  The key thing, and this is a report that's up on Infowars.com, and we're going to show you this clip of this in just a moment.
[01:53:46.574 --> 01:53:49.416]  Alex Jones said what they're doing here is the D.C.
[01:53:49.496 --> 01:53:58.184]  police, who are really under the control of President Obama, these people have been standing down and allowing this to happen with the protesters.
[01:53:58.584 --> 01:53:58.704]  That's
[01:54:16.067 --> 01:54:17.408]  This is what they want to have happen.
[01:54:17.428 --> 01:54:19.528]  That's why Obama allowed this to happen.
[01:54:19.849 --> 01:54:26.011]  And the report we have up on InfoWars.com is police allow BLM to attack women at the Trump inauguration.
[01:54:26.051 --> 01:54:30.853]  Of course, we've seen not only rain, but we've seen the police in D.C.
[01:54:30.993 --> 01:54:33.434]  allow the free reign of Black Lives Matter.
[01:54:33.454 --> 01:54:42.198]  And you've got an article here where you've got an example of how the mainstream press is trying to create a narrative saying, look, nobody showed up for Donald Trump's inauguration.
[01:54:42.498 --> 01:54:43.699]  Such a divided country here.
[01:54:43.759 --> 01:54:46.801]  People, you know, what a difference it is between him and President Obama.
[01:54:47.161 --> 01:54:50.164]  I mentioned this earlier with the optics that the media is trying to use.
[01:54:50.504 --> 01:54:54.647]  So here's, this is CNN, if you guys can get this picture here on this iPad.
[01:54:55.287 --> 01:54:58.510]  So they say, the inaugural crowds, Trump's versus Obama's.
[01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:05.235]  He campaigned on the huge crowd sizes, but the turnout for President Trump's inauguration appears to be smaller than that of his predecessor.
[01:55:05.675 --> 01:55:17.818]  Yeah, and so they're using a photograph from early this morning before the crowd was even there, versus this is probably when the actual Obama's inauguration was going on.
[01:55:18.138 --> 01:55:25.779]  So they're going to just let this fake news roll out, and we all saw with our own eyes as the inauguration was happening with Donald Trump, this place was packed.
[01:55:26.199 --> 01:55:34.641]  But this is what CNN fake news is saying the inauguration looked like, because people are so against public enemy number one, President Donald Trump.
[01:55:35.041 --> 01:55:43.543]  And of course, as we began the program, we were talking about the glowing terms in which the mainstream media was describing Obama's inauguration eight years ago.
[01:55:43.563 --> 01:55:46.804]  They're talking about the beautiful weather, how unseasonably warm it was, etc., etc.
[01:55:46.844 --> 01:55:47.884]  So this is against the weather.
[01:55:48.244 --> 01:55:55.746]  This is against the Black Lives Matter people who have been allowed to shut down the entrances getting into the inauguration area as well.
[01:55:55.806 --> 01:56:00.827]  And so they create all of this and then come out with their, see, we told you so, nobody showed up.
[01:56:00.967 --> 01:56:01.668]  That's not true.
[01:56:01.808 --> 01:56:02.948]  Hillary won the popular vote.
[01:56:03.448 --> 01:56:06.231]  I want to play this clip that we have as part of this article.
[01:56:06.271 --> 01:56:10.635]  This is from our crew and Alex Jones in Washington D.C.
[01:56:11.276 --> 01:56:18.623]  showing how Black Lives Matter was allowed to attack women, showing how the police have stood down to allow this to happen.
[01:56:18.663 --> 01:56:20.045]  Here's that clip from Alex Jones and crew.
[01:56:21.034 --> 01:56:22.635]  I pulled myself up by his testicles.
[01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:23.556]  Good!
[01:56:23.736 --> 01:56:25.137]  And now they're blocking the gates.
[01:56:25.217 --> 01:56:25.997]  Yeah, they're blocking.
[01:56:26.017 --> 01:56:27.778]  They're sitting down and blocking all the gates.
[01:56:28.018 --> 01:56:28.519]  Oh, really?
[01:56:28.559 --> 01:56:29.719]  We've got a protest.
[01:56:29.739 --> 01:56:30.400]  We've got to go.
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:31.060]  Many protests.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:31.440]  Are you ready?
[01:56:31.521 --> 01:56:31.961]  Absolutely.
[01:56:31.981 --> 01:56:32.541]  We're live.
[01:56:32.641 --> 01:56:36.644]  Okay, the leftists, now they are blocking the gates.
[01:56:36.704 --> 01:56:38.925]  And, ma'am, tell folks who you are and what happened to you.
[01:56:39.085 --> 01:56:40.226]  I'm Shannon Martinez.
[01:56:40.806 --> 01:56:42.367]  I was trying to get in the gate back there.
[01:56:42.387 --> 01:56:43.728]  I went to cross the line.
[01:56:44.308 --> 01:56:45.909]  As you can see, I have a cane.
[01:56:45.949 --> 01:56:46.629]  I have RSD.
[01:56:46.869 --> 01:56:47.950]  They yanked me to the ground.
[01:56:48.150 --> 01:56:48.410]  Who did?
[01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:50.051]  They started kicking me, the protesters.
[01:56:50.291 --> 01:56:51.432]  They started kicking me.
[01:56:51.732 --> 01:56:54.854]  I got kicked in the face, and a grown man kicked me twice in the chest.
[01:56:55.254 --> 01:56:57.095]  The only thing that saved me was my motorcycle.
[01:56:57.135 --> 01:56:57.875]  Did they get arrested?
[01:56:58.056 --> 01:56:58.336]  No.
[01:56:58.436 --> 01:56:59.656]  The police were standing there.
[01:56:59.737 --> 01:57:04.279]  When I got up and was crying, the police literally turned their back to me.
[01:57:04.599 --> 01:57:07.101]  The reporters were the ones that asked if I was OK.
[01:57:08.181 --> 01:57:10.443]  Where are these protesters?
[01:57:10.684 --> 01:57:15.548]  Are they still there right now?
[01:57:15.908 --> 01:57:18.391]  Right at that white tent way down there.
[01:57:18.411 --> 01:57:19.331]  And they attacked you?
[01:57:19.452 --> 01:57:20.132]  They attacked me.
[01:57:20.172 --> 01:57:25.037]  They literally yanked me to the ground, took my cane, and started kicking me.
[01:57:25.117 --> 01:57:27.539]  And for the sake of honesty, I think that's the only gate they were blocking.
[01:57:27.559 --> 01:57:28.440]  I didn't see that happening.
[01:57:29.156 --> 01:57:33.801]  Did the guys go to the phone?
[01:57:33.841 --> 01:57:40.348]  Well, hey, in a little while... Okay, I'm going down there in a minute, yeah.
[01:57:56.630 --> 01:58:01.631]  Support this network and not only support us but trigger the verified Libtards on Twitter.
[01:58:01.731 --> 01:58:04.392]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[01:58:04.472 --> 01:58:10.474]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[01:58:10.494 --> 01:58:12.834]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[01:58:12.974 --> 01:58:21.156]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[01:58:21.236 --> 01:58:24.117]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[01:58:24.537 --> 01:58:34.223]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[01:58:34.323 --> 01:58:37.544]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[01:58:37.644 --> 01:58:45.369]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:45.389 --> 01:58:46.409]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:58:46.489 --> 01:58:48.551]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[01:58:48.591 --> 01:58:49.591]  It was hilarious.
[01:58:51.713 --> 01:58:53.935]  They wrote it at Vice.com!
[01:58:54.055 --> 01:59:03.844]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[01:59:03.884 --> 01:59:06.307]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[01:59:06.907 --> 01:59:13.334]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[01:59:13.934 --> 01:59:15.556]  Gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[01:59:16.736 --> 01:59:23.018]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[01:59:23.078 --> 01:59:25.198]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[01:59:25.218 --> 01:59:26.719]  You're gonna get triggered over this?
[01:59:26.799 --> 01:59:27.039]  Good.
[01:59:27.299 --> 01:59:28.619]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[01:59:28.779 --> 01:59:33.500]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:35.861]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[01:59:36.301 --> 01:59:38.663]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[01:59:39.003 --> 01:59:41.905]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[01:59:41.945 --> 01:59:43.486]  Get your Brain Force right now.
[01:59:43.526 --> 01:59:44.446]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:59:44.506 --> 01:59:47.568]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:56.154 --> 02:00:00.096]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:03.539 --> 02:00:07.386]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[02:00:07.666 --> 02:00:10.751]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:00:15.014 --> 02:00:18.938]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:21.720]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:27.005]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about going up to the White House.
[02:00:27.165 --> 02:00:33.812]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[02:00:33.872 --> 02:00:36.134]  They are coming to my house!
[02:00:39.144 --> 02:00:45.247]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:00:45.307 --> 02:00:50.529]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[02:00:50.809 --> 02:00:53.270]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[02:00:55.291 --> 02:00:59.953]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[02:01:00.113 --> 02:01:04.715]  From the front lines of the Info Room, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:15.675 --> 02:01:19.278]  Welcome to the beginning of the third hour of the first transmission of 2018.
[02:01:19.398 --> 02:01:20.379]  Wow.
[02:01:20.739 --> 02:01:23.281]  That's going to take some getting used to.
[02:01:23.301 --> 02:01:25.222]  I keep wanting to say 17.
[02:01:25.962 --> 02:01:27.944]  The globalists don't want us to build our own economy.
[02:01:28.144 --> 02:01:30.906]  But when you fund the Infowar, you fund your own future.
[02:01:30.946 --> 02:01:36.950]  You've seen the dividends just in the tax cuts, the sovereignty, our borders getting secure, that supporting Infowar has already brought you.
[02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:44.354]  So get free shipping and 50% off on MycoZx and Floralife that go great together for gut health right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:01:44.554 --> 02:01:49.937]  This special's about to end, but let's also look at the victims of globalism and how welfare is used to control them.
[02:01:50.157 --> 02:01:50.518]  Here it is.
[02:01:51.618 --> 02:01:57.021]  I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all.
[02:01:57.782 --> 02:02:06.087]  And the person who's not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person
[02:02:07.028 --> 02:02:09.671]  That's working his and her ass off.
[02:02:09.791 --> 02:02:10.972]  And it's not going to happen.
[02:02:11.653 --> 02:02:12.353]  Not going to happen.
[02:02:14.595 --> 02:02:17.598]  Give me my food stamps.
[02:02:18.119 --> 02:02:20.781]  Do you really want to work or do you just want to get a free check?
[02:02:20.821 --> 02:02:23.264]  I just want to get a free check.
[02:02:24.045 --> 02:02:26.207]  There's a sign behind you that says Waverly Job Center.
[02:02:26.227 --> 02:02:28.149]  Do you have any intention of going in to get a job?
[02:02:28.169 --> 02:02:29.510]  Or are you just going to get the food stamps?
[02:02:31.543 --> 02:02:33.825]  Not looking for a job.
[02:02:34.145 --> 02:02:38.628]  Why should I have to go work at retail and deal with snobby customers?
[02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:40.129]  Why?
[02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:44.132]  Why should I have to dare choose to do that?
[02:02:44.795 --> 02:02:48.758]  We called the Department of Children and Families to see what they've been doing to help.
[02:02:49.198 --> 02:02:55.762]  DCF says Hillsborough Kids Incorporated has been helping by paying Adam's rent, even providing her furniture.
[02:02:56.223 --> 02:02:57.944]  Adam says it isn't enough.
[02:02:58.344 --> 02:03:06.249]  Somebody needs to pay for all my children and my and Gary, all our suffering, all our pain.
[02:03:06.289 --> 02:03:09.891]  Somebody needs to be held accountable and they need to pay.
[02:03:10.352 --> 02:03:11.793]  I honestly
[02:03:15.299 --> 02:03:16.240]  I don't want to work.
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:18.061]  And I'm not going to.
[02:03:18.101 --> 02:03:19.722]  You can't force me.
[02:03:19.882 --> 02:03:21.183]  I need my food stamps.
[02:03:21.483 --> 02:03:22.243]  I need them.
[02:03:22.984 --> 02:03:23.204]  Okay?
[02:03:23.224 --> 02:03:24.205]  This is not a joke.
[02:03:25.356 --> 02:03:26.637]  Just give me my food stamps.
[02:03:26.677 --> 02:03:27.899]  That's all I'm asking for.
[02:03:28.359 --> 02:03:37.289]  They are not incapacitated in any way or they, you know, they don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could be observable.
[02:03:37.489 --> 02:03:45.238]  More counties will join them as federal exemptions to the requirements expire now that unemployment is below 10% for each affected county.
[02:03:45.458 --> 02:03:48.139]  I felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while.
[02:03:48.239 --> 02:03:53.601]  They're just for people who really, really need it, I thought, and I'm like living this flippant lifestyle in San Francisco.
[02:03:53.701 --> 02:03:55.141]  Do you think you really, really need it?
[02:03:55.181 --> 02:04:07.486]  Well, yeah, and eventually I just sort of realized that even though I'm 24, like, I still have responsibilities, I still have, like, hopes for my future, and if I need to be on food stamps to make that happen, then maybe I do really need it.
[02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:08.426]  Are you employed?
[02:04:09.006 --> 02:04:10.567]  No.
[02:04:10.587 --> 02:04:11.207]  How do you feel about that?
[02:04:12.236 --> 02:04:19.927]  I'm comfortable with it and I feel like I don't need to look for one because I get a check from the government every month.
[02:04:20.047 --> 02:04:22.992]  Do you feel guilty about using your food stamp card when you have $850,000 in the bank?
[02:04:23.012 --> 02:04:23.052]  No.
[02:04:27.953 --> 02:04:28.514]  No, I don't.
[02:04:29.915 --> 02:04:37.703]  I'm going by the rules, and if they need to change their rules, they can change their rules, but I don't see I'm doing anything wrong.
[02:04:38.123 --> 02:04:39.985]  How much do you collect in benefits?
[02:04:40.605 --> 02:04:46.691]  I give $780 in food stamps, $500 in tannins, and I get Medicaid and WIC.
[02:04:47.052 --> 02:04:50.035]  Give me my food stamps.
[02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:55.552]  Welfare reform.
[02:04:55.652 --> 02:04:57.599]  Does anybody want welfare reform?
[02:05:02.327 --> 02:05:04.248]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:05:04.288 --> 02:05:05.368]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:06.549]  Why is this so good?
[02:05:06.829 --> 02:05:12.072]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:05:12.152 --> 02:05:25.718]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:05:25.778 --> 02:05:27.159]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:05:27.919 --> 02:05:29.501]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:05:29.581 --> 02:05:32.083]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:05:32.163 --> 02:05:33.425]  These are all parasites.
[02:05:33.485 --> 02:05:34.566]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:05:34.586 --> 02:05:35.627]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:05:35.927 --> 02:05:40.272]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:05:40.472 --> 02:05:43.635]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:05:43.695 --> 02:05:46.796]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:05:46.816 --> 02:05:47.817]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:05:47.877 --> 02:05:49.757]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:49.817 --> 02:05:50.858]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:05:51.138 --> 02:05:52.939]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:05:53.559 --> 02:05:56.600]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:58.741]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:05:59.121 --> 02:06:01.082]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:13.082]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:13.622 --> 02:06:15.463]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.423 --> 02:06:19.504]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:06:20.165 --> 02:06:22.366]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:22.386 --> 02:06:25.207]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:25.827 --> 02:06:28.308]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:06:28.909 --> 02:06:31.270]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:06:33.736 --> 02:06:36.717]  Nobody is untouchable.
[02:06:36.797 --> 02:06:38.198]  No one is invincible.
[02:06:38.998 --> 02:06:41.559]  No one's untouchable by other men, much less God.
[02:06:44.259 --> 02:06:47.060]  And God is beginning to cut down the globalists like rats.
[02:06:48.441 --> 02:06:50.341]  The corrupt, evil, communist pope.
[02:06:51.262 --> 02:06:54.342]  The communist Chinese, the biggest mass murderers in history.
[02:06:54.843 --> 02:06:58.524]  The Saudi Arabians that oppress women and murder people worldwide.
[02:06:59.383 --> 02:07:04.707]  They're all panicking against our new president, Donald John Trump.
[02:07:05.988 --> 02:07:10.192]  My gut told me two years ago to get behind Trump, but Ted Cruz had better rhetoric.
[02:07:11.132 --> 02:07:15.576]  So I was for him the first few months, but then I saw some things I didn't like.
[02:07:16.116 --> 02:07:19.999]  And even before the dirty tricks in Iowa and places, I went for Trump.
[02:07:20.019 --> 02:07:22.221]  And I said, my gut's never wrong.
[02:07:22.241 --> 02:07:23.862]  And as I get older, I learned to always follow.
[02:07:23.882 --> 02:07:24.803]  When I was young, I wouldn't.
[02:07:24.823 --> 02:07:26.584]  Proved me right.
[02:07:26.704 --> 02:07:28.146]  And man, I am humbled.
[02:07:29.195 --> 02:07:40.879]  By President Trump, I am humbled by his discernment, his knowledge, his piercing discernment and analysis.
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:48.662]  Now in this first hour, I'm going to air 20 plus minutes of the entire inaugural speech.
[02:07:48.722 --> 02:07:50.643]  Some of it is him thanking
[02:07:51.704 --> 02:07:59.450]  The Clintons and other presidents, but it's all backhanded because then he says, but now, you did a great job doing all this horrible stuff, but now that all comes to an end.
[02:08:01.151 --> 02:08:03.553]  And there are tidbits in there.
[02:08:04.614 --> 02:08:09.237]  And again, I was, I was there just, just, just, just two days ago.
[02:08:11.739 --> 02:08:14.961]  Just right below the podium, witnessing it.
[02:08:16.823 --> 02:08:17.984]  And the rebirth of America.
[02:08:19.659 --> 02:08:26.404]  And the biggest piece of news, the biggest Trump secret I'm gonna give out here, and you're gonna say, oh I've heard this a bunch the last year on your show, yes.
[02:08:27.205 --> 02:08:40.516]  Trump, he, but you notice what you hear on the show, and even the New York Times and a bunch of other publications had to admit this, what you hear here you're gonna hear from Trump, but not because Trump's getting it from me, this is the spirit of America and the truth.
[02:08:42.617 --> 02:08:45.900]  Do you understand that it's admitted in congressional hearings that they call it
[02:08:46.874 --> 02:08:48.315]  Disruptive technologies.
[02:08:48.375 --> 02:08:52.337]  A 200-mile-to-the-gallon carburetor they had 25 years ago.
[02:08:53.458 --> 02:08:55.379]  Hell, 40 years ago they had 100-something miles.
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:04.565]  Solar panels that basically never break, never go out, and that have five times the gathering capacity of the very best systems today.
[02:09:04.925 --> 02:09:05.505]  Things like that.
[02:09:05.805 --> 02:09:07.947]  They're slowly doling out the technology.
[02:09:08.367 --> 02:09:12.609]  The elites are on incredible power trips, sequestering it for a breakaway civilization.
[02:09:13.010 --> 02:09:14.931]  The future's here, it's just not evenly distributed.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:40.269]  Trump intends to flood the entire planet with true globalism, with America as the operating system, the true America, not the modern liberal globalist eugenics America, but really working with people, really standing up for cultures that have good societies, crushing radical Islam, and transferring
[02:09:41.226 --> 02:09:49.392]  To the public, and transferring and ordering the pharmaceutical companies to know we're not going to treat all these cancers, you're going to give them the cures.
[02:09:49.773 --> 02:09:55.037]  And when I say cures, some people individually won't respond, but they've got stuff that's 99% effective.
[02:09:55.577 --> 02:09:57.178]  The elites are getting it, it's how they're living to 110, 115.
[02:10:02.463 --> 02:10:04.884]  So, if you're educated and informed, you know all this.
[02:10:04.964 --> 02:10:27.735]  And a lot of people, under the old globalist model, were clamoring to be part of the new civilization that they thought would be separate from humanity, and if they groveled to the New World Order, they would get the cancer treatments, they would get the life extension, they could be part of the secret programs and projects... ...that, I guess, those on Elysium would have access to.
[02:10:29.495 --> 02:10:30.616]  That's not happening now.
[02:10:32.122 --> 02:10:33.203]  If Trump has his way.
[02:10:33.783 --> 02:10:52.933]  The biggest secret of Trump is that he intends to turn loose all these disruptive technologies and to actually let partners have them and to work with Russia and others that also have advanced technologies because he knows a deal was made to let China take over.
[02:10:53.956 --> 02:11:00.481]  With economic warfare, and let them control the system, because they've proven themselves evil, killing over 100 million of their own people.
[02:11:00.742 --> 02:11:03.684]  So our elite went to work with China, just like they had been the last month.
[02:11:03.944 --> 02:11:06.927]  I told you months ago, they'll plan on China propping up world government.
[02:11:07.207 --> 02:11:09.709]  China to save this collapsing system.
[02:11:09.869 --> 02:11:11.871]  And then they come out in the news in hundreds of publications.
[02:11:12.191 --> 02:11:15.514]  Communist China to save the New World Order, and to defeat Trump.
[02:11:15.574 --> 02:11:15.794]  See?
[02:11:16.074 --> 02:11:19.817]  Our own media siding with people that oppress their own population.
[02:11:20.257 --> 02:11:20.618]  People ask,
[02:11:21.448 --> 02:11:23.769]  Especially intelligence agencies and military and others.
[02:11:23.789 --> 02:11:24.989]  They go, how does Jones know this?
[02:11:25.009 --> 02:11:28.451]  I had the New York Times walk up to me and say, you had to talk to Trump.
[02:11:28.811 --> 02:11:29.311]  I talked to you.
[02:11:29.331 --> 02:11:38.434]  I said, you tweeted that Trump is going to declare the new American century and godly providence and invoke God and take the birthright.
[02:11:38.635 --> 02:11:39.455]  Did you talk to him?
[02:11:39.475 --> 02:11:44.677]  I said, I said, I'm not going to comment because I just talked to him that week.
[02:11:46.257 --> 02:11:47.518]  I said I didn't talk to him about that.
[02:11:48.663 --> 02:11:53.205]  I looked at that New York Times guy who was just empty sold, an intellectual smart, but empty sold.
[02:11:53.865 --> 02:11:58.607]  And I said, it's the spirit, like the sixth sense, the ether, the brain's internet.
[02:11:58.667 --> 02:12:09.551]  I said, this is the destiny of America that people 500 years ago in England and Germany and the Netherlands and France envisioned in their minds, this whole future.
[02:12:09.951 --> 02:12:12.792]  Hell, 200 years ago, they were envisioning biometrics computers.
[02:12:13.032 --> 02:12:17.054]  They drew the double helix before an electron microscope was invented, they knew it.
[02:12:17.987 --> 02:12:19.789]  That's how beautiful humans are.
[02:12:20.249 --> 02:12:24.314]  And Trump knows that and wants to empower people, not enslave them.
[02:12:24.654 --> 02:12:26.476]  He feels small when you're small.
[02:12:28.358 --> 02:12:32.923]  The elite are so small, they feel good when you're down in the ditch, poor, a peon.
[02:12:37.898 --> 02:12:42.362]  So they're all over the news saying he's destroying the American-run world government, the New World Order.
[02:12:42.562 --> 02:12:43.343]  It's not American-run.
[02:12:43.383 --> 02:12:47.867]  They used our power, our ingenuity, our system to build it and to destroy it.
[02:12:49.368 --> 02:12:51.630]  They build their world government while they destroy us.
[02:12:52.330 --> 02:13:02.259]  And they don't deliver any of the promises of the new global Atlantis that they got all the loving, smart, hard-working people to join them.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:05.141]  They got so many members of my family
[02:13:05.882 --> 02:13:19.670]  In the last 60 years, who were all tops of their classes, or the best in the army, or the best at what they did, to join them, believing they were there to help poor people, believing they were there to deliver technology, believing they were there to really do all this, and it was all a lie!
[02:13:20.771 --> 02:13:28.155]  Well, Trump knows about all this, and this is now not a lie, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why the enemy of humanity is freaking out.
[02:13:29.278 --> 02:13:32.221]  Pulling out every stop, having convulsions.
[02:13:32.281 --> 02:13:39.707]  Next hour, I'm going to show you what has just recently been re-released from 60 Minutes in 19, what is it, 1964?
[02:13:41.268 --> 02:13:50.016]  Gloria Steinem of Miss Magazine and the whole feminist movement admitting she worked for the CIA and the whole plan was to get women to work for the government and to basically end the family.
[02:13:50.877 --> 02:13:51.798]  They are so arrogant.
[02:13:51.818 --> 02:13:52.578]  They are so evil.
[02:13:52.919 --> 02:13:54.300]  This is all coming up in the next hour.
[02:13:58.021 --> 02:14:01.364]  Donald Trump's new world order puts nation over globe.
[02:14:02.065 --> 02:14:04.006]  Trump challenge the world order.
[02:14:04.287 --> 02:14:06.368]  Trump's new world disorder.
[02:14:07.049 --> 02:14:09.331]  Will Trump be the end of the Pax Americana?
[02:14:09.711 --> 02:14:16.057]  Trump's taking off the spells end of the world for 20th century German FM Steinmeier.
[02:14:16.617 --> 02:14:18.099]  The end of liberal world order.
[02:14:18.159 --> 02:14:19.340]  The liberal world order?
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:22.863]  I saw this weekend going, it's the end of the liberal world order.
[02:14:24.266 --> 02:14:25.248]  China will save it!
[02:14:25.308 --> 02:14:28.894]  He'll save the democratic order, as the Chinese president spoke at Davos.
[02:14:29.355 --> 02:14:30.537]  China's unelected!
[02:14:33.502 --> 02:14:34.964]  China enslaves its people!
[02:14:35.846 --> 02:14:36.828]  Trump was elected!
[02:14:39.881 --> 02:14:44.303]  Their world government's anti-human, anti-nation-state, anti-prosperity.
[02:14:44.724 --> 02:14:46.585]  Let me tell you what Russia's involved in.
[02:14:47.465 --> 02:14:51.687]  Russia kicked the oligarchs out about 17 years ago, and I wasn't sure if it was real for a while.
[02:14:51.767 --> 02:14:57.330]  And they started teaching Christianity and family and paying people to have kids and paying people to not eat GMO.
[02:14:57.591 --> 02:15:01.793]  And they say they're stopping the vaccines and they're going to be the world distributor of non-GMO food.
[02:15:03.614 --> 02:15:06.335]  And the light came back in the Russians' eyes all of a sudden.
[02:15:06.415 --> 02:15:07.416]  That was an example of the world.
[02:15:07.696 --> 02:15:09.097]  I was already doing this before Russia did it.
[02:15:09.926 --> 02:15:10.866]  They didn't get it from me.
[02:15:10.947 --> 02:15:12.587]  They just were rediscovering their humanity.
[02:15:12.947 --> 02:15:18.390]  And now Trump and everybody else and Brexit and Spain and Italy pulling out of the Euro.
[02:15:18.730 --> 02:15:20.311]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:15:20.651 --> 02:15:35.859]  They're in crisis because their world government was admittedly about austerity and starving people and eugenics and anti-human and was a breakaway civilization where they steal all the treasure of humanity and give it to themselves, not us!
[02:15:39.322 --> 02:15:40.722]  So does Trump take me serious?
[02:15:41.402 --> 02:15:45.183]  When his top advisors, his generals, you name it, are listeners, you damn well he does.
[02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:49.604]  But his discernment spirit already believes it and knows it and loves it.
[02:15:49.704 --> 02:15:51.264]  So people ask, do I talk to Donald Trump?
[02:15:51.704 --> 02:15:54.084]  Talk to him every day, right here on the air.
[02:15:54.324 --> 02:15:57.285]  So get that through your heads, folks, who are freaking out.
[02:15:57.305 --> 02:16:01.426]  Yeah, we talk to Donald Trump, the president, every day.
[02:16:02.887 --> 02:16:12.798]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[02:16:13.559 --> 02:16:16.542]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist.
[02:16:17.463 --> 02:16:22.885]  Controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[02:16:23.305 --> 02:16:26.286]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[02:16:26.866 --> 02:16:36.550]  Clothing is a statement and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:42.212]  So right now folks we're going to debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the Infowars store.
[02:16:43.292 --> 02:16:45.013]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[02:16:45.073 --> 02:16:46.013]  It's a limited edition.
[02:16:46.594 --> 02:16:48.575]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:16:48.795 --> 02:16:55.538]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[02:16:55.758 --> 02:17:00.040]  And on the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.781]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[02:17:02.521 --> 02:17:07.866]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[02:17:08.166 --> 02:17:16.995]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:21.539]  And on the back, Infowars.com is the standard of real news.
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:23.161]  And of course, this classic?
[02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:24.442]  Says it all.
[02:17:24.562 --> 02:17:25.442]  Need I say more?
[02:17:25.943 --> 02:17:27.544]  You want to have a political message out there?
[02:17:27.564 --> 02:17:33.348]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[02:17:33.689 --> 02:17:36.771]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[02:17:37.211 --> 02:17:42.796]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[02:17:43.516 --> 02:17:45.857]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:54.540]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:58.382]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[02:17:59.222 --> 02:18:08.693]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[02:18:08.833 --> 02:18:11.316]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[02:18:11.697 --> 02:18:12.798]  InfoWars.com.
[02:18:12.818 --> 02:18:13.318]  Spread the word.
[02:18:14.059 --> 02:18:15.160]  I designed this baby.
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:17.662]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[02:18:18.063 --> 02:18:22.307]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:18:22.707 --> 02:18:26.471]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[02:18:26.951 --> 02:18:29.653]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[02:18:29.673 --> 02:18:31.075]  It's been around about 19 years.
[02:18:31.695 --> 02:18:35.299]  It's the classic Infowars tyranny response team shirt.
[02:18:35.579 --> 02:18:38.662]  And of course, we've seen the NFL taking a knee
[02:18:39.562 --> 02:18:43.164]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[02:18:43.884 --> 02:18:44.765]  That's disrespectful.
[02:18:44.785 --> 02:18:48.806]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[02:18:48.866 --> 02:18:56.310]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[02:18:56.710 --> 02:18:58.170]  Our republic is in distress.
[02:18:58.631 --> 02:18:59.111]  Ask me why.
[02:18:59.771 --> 02:19:01.694]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[02:19:01.854 --> 02:19:07.321]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[02:19:07.841 --> 02:19:09.343]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[02:19:09.383 --> 02:19:12.387]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[02:19:12.827 --> 02:19:14.990]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[02:19:15.611 --> 02:19:17.854]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[02:19:18.553 --> 02:19:19.334]  It's all about freedom.
[02:19:19.374 --> 02:19:20.697]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[02:19:21.237 --> 02:19:22.159]  Resist Tyranny.
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:23.782]  Made in America.
[02:19:23.802 --> 02:19:23.782]  1776.
[02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:27.508]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[02:19:27.728 --> 02:19:28.709]  The backs are really cool.
[02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:29.711]  Look at that back.
[02:19:29.791 --> 02:19:30.693]  That is pure Americara.
[02:19:31.917 --> 02:19:37.080]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:37.881]  The Dayglo.
[02:19:38.381 --> 02:19:42.463]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[02:19:42.623 --> 02:19:44.244]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[02:19:44.625 --> 02:19:45.945]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[02:19:46.065 --> 02:19:47.226]  It's got the nice patch.
[02:19:47.566 --> 02:19:48.607]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:48.847 --> 02:19:49.728]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[02:19:49.988 --> 02:19:53.410]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:55.411]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[02:19:55.671 --> 02:20:00.454]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:20:15.831 --> 02:20:24.893]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.474 --> 02:20:30.095]  So, don't believe me, just listen to Trump's speech.
[02:20:30.195 --> 02:20:34.096]  We're about to discover the keys to ending disease and death.
[02:20:34.876 --> 02:20:35.996]  The keys to hell and death.
[02:20:38.597 --> 02:20:40.157]  All of it, now manifesting.
[02:20:40.477 --> 02:20:43.798]  We're about to discover the secrets of energy and the universe and space travel.
[02:20:45.894 --> 02:20:49.976]  You look at his face, he just looks happy but disgusting as he's getting the briefings.
[02:20:50.517 --> 02:20:52.998]  Everything was already told by the top generals and the Patriots.
[02:20:53.038 --> 02:20:54.459]  Sir, we've got everything.
[02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:55.299]  They've already got it.
[02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:57.220]  They don't know how to deliver it to the people.
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:00.242]  Well, the answer is export the excess population to space.
[02:21:01.203 --> 02:21:02.843]  Give people the technology.
[02:21:02.863 --> 02:21:04.044]  Give them the life extension.
[02:21:04.544 --> 02:21:06.345]  Let them know how magic the universe is.
[02:21:06.385 --> 02:21:09.607]  Don't keep them diverted with a bunch of NFL and fake culture.
[02:21:09.887 --> 02:21:11.448]  You've artificially fed them.
[02:21:12.489 --> 02:21:14.270]  Put wind into humanity's sails.
[02:21:15.413 --> 02:21:18.435]  And America is not going to just shrink away and not be strong.
[02:21:18.656 --> 02:21:19.797]  We're going to be stronger than ever.
[02:21:20.057 --> 02:21:22.779]  We've been used to empower the world government.
[02:21:23.279 --> 02:21:24.981]  Let me actually start getting to the speech.
[02:21:25.361 --> 02:21:26.782]  It'll take the rest of the hour to get to.
[02:21:27.743 --> 02:21:30.485]  And in the next hour, guess who was funding?
[02:21:30.525 --> 02:21:31.286]  I mean, I already knew this.
[02:21:31.366 --> 02:21:32.186]  I checked a few of the groups.
[02:21:32.306 --> 02:21:32.907]  I didn't know.
[02:21:34.929 --> 02:21:38.531]  I didn't know that 40 of the 52 groups were Soros funded.
[02:21:38.591 --> 02:21:39.612]  I said it was obviously Soros.
[02:21:40.213 --> 02:21:40.973]  A bunch of women in
[02:21:44.281 --> 02:21:51.351]  Little pink, purple, Color Revolution hat screaming, F you white male Alex Jones, go to hell, hope you die.
[02:21:51.372 --> 02:21:56.239]  And then saying, but we love you, love Trump's hate.
[02:21:58.427 --> 02:21:59.688]  And I'm sorry, I said 40 from memory.
[02:21:59.888 --> 02:22:03.091]  It's 50 partners of the Women's March on Washington, which is almost every group.
[02:22:03.391 --> 02:22:06.373]  The other major group is funded by the Islamic Jihad.
[02:22:06.393 --> 02:22:15.621]  And I saw all these women, including American women, Hispanic, black, white, in hijab, saying, this is how we empower women.
[02:22:16.061 --> 02:22:17.222]  You're bullying Muslims.
[02:22:17.262 --> 02:22:19.184]  We're going to put hoods on and go under Islam.
[02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:21.606]  Talk about being cuckold.
[02:22:21.646 --> 02:22:23.027]  Talk about Stockholm syndrome.
[02:22:24.264 --> 02:22:28.426]  Woman's March organizer recently met ex-Hamas operative, family has ties to terror group.
[02:22:28.666 --> 02:22:33.309]  Yeah, the leader of it is a woman that promotes, just like Uma Abedin's mother did, genital mutilation.
[02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:35.330]  She's the leading person pushing it.
[02:22:37.911 --> 02:22:45.295]  And that's how women are empowered is wearing hoods, not being able to drive cars, being stoned to death if they go outside and don't follow their husband's orders.
[02:22:45.975 --> 02:22:46.796]  And I bring this up to them.
[02:22:46.816 --> 02:22:50.758]  We have a clip coming up next hour where one of our reporters brings it up.
[02:22:53.663 --> 02:22:54.844]  And the women go, that's a lie.
[02:22:54.904 --> 02:22:56.366]  Trump was funded by Saudi Arabia.
[02:22:57.006 --> 02:22:58.828]  Trump got zero money from Saudi Arabia.
[02:22:59.128 --> 02:23:00.450]  Zero money from Goldman Sachs.
[02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:02.051]  Zero money from the big globalists.
[02:23:02.071 --> 02:23:02.632]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:23:02.832 --> 02:23:04.814]  They should scream and spit at us and say he did.
[02:23:10.099 --> 02:23:13.643]  And it's just a bunch of weird corporate-owned... I mean, I love DrudgeReport.com.
[02:23:13.663 --> 02:23:14.404]  Can we punch that up?
[02:23:15.618 --> 02:23:17.099]  I'm a woman, hear me roar.
[02:23:17.919 --> 02:23:19.060]  It's Gloria Steinem.
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:21.381]  Had a bunch of kids, but she says you shouldn't have a kid.
[02:23:21.781 --> 02:23:24.283]  She's proud of abortions, says that's how you prove your woman's killed your baby.
[02:23:24.783 --> 02:23:25.924]  I'm not attacking you if you had an abortion.
[02:23:25.944 --> 02:23:27.224]  The point is she makes it a sacrament.
[02:23:27.745 --> 02:23:34.749]  And then she's admittedly CIA-funded to break up the family, turn men into betas, and make us easy to assimilate.
[02:23:35.129 --> 02:23:37.990]  And she admits that in a book she wrote and interviews.
[02:23:38.331 --> 02:23:40.672]  And there she is out there smiling with her victims.
[02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:44.331]  This is how you kill cultures and society.
[02:23:44.611 --> 02:23:45.652]  This isn't my opinion.
[02:23:45.872 --> 02:23:47.453]  This is declassified.
[02:23:47.473 --> 02:23:49.355]  It's all coming up in the second hour.
[02:23:49.375 --> 02:23:53.918]  But let's start, let's start with the beginning.
[02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:04.487]  Let's start with the beginning of the speech, with the Star-Spangled Banner, because I was watching the Jumbotron, because I couldn't see the Obamas.
[02:24:04.507 --> 02:24:05.928]  They were kind of back, because I was so close.
[02:24:05.948 --> 02:24:06.949]  I was looking up at the podium.
[02:24:06.969 --> 02:24:08.690]  I could only see people when they were up speaking at it.
[02:24:09.571 --> 02:24:10.852]  There was just the top of Donald's head.
[02:24:12.984 --> 02:24:15.728]  I can see the rabbi, the priest, you know, just the top of them.
[02:24:16.208 --> 02:24:17.470]  I can see them on the Jumbotron.
[02:24:19.432 --> 02:24:22.736]  And they just look so pissed off the whole time.
[02:24:23.998 --> 02:24:26.321]  And so entitled because they never worked for this.
[02:24:26.341 --> 02:24:29.445]  They were just given it as minions of this corporate takeover.
[02:24:33.573 --> 02:24:41.074]  America on its deathbed finally awakened to globalism and said no to it, and you can feel the tidal resistance surging.
[02:24:41.114 --> 02:24:41.735]  They're so scared.
[02:24:41.755 --> 02:24:49.236]  So let's just play the intro, and him being nice, but I love how he wrote this himself, that no president since Kennedy has written a speech himself.
[02:24:49.936 --> 02:24:50.716]  I mean, they admit this.
[02:24:50.776 --> 02:24:51.116]  I love it.
[02:25:04.768 --> 02:25:13.691]  Again, there's also a Star-Spangled Banner we're going to play later.
[02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:20.994]  A lot of stations cut away from that, but this is... So again, here they are singing...
[02:25:34.642 --> 02:25:35.803]  Talking about America the Free.
[02:25:42.449 --> 02:25:49.335]  So they're singing America the Free.
[02:25:50.796 --> 02:25:56.621]  And then Trump comes up and he says, oh you've done an exceptional job, yeah, raping the country, but now all that ends.
[02:25:57.702 --> 02:25:59.404]  And then he gets into the real meat and potatoes.
[02:26:00.565 --> 02:26:01.746]  And there aren't words.
[02:26:03.891 --> 02:26:11.135]  To describe how ultra, how ultra over-the-top cool this is.
[02:26:11.856 --> 02:26:13.857]  Everything he says is dialed into truth.
[02:26:14.417 --> 02:26:17.959]  It countermands how America was used to build a tyrannical world government.
[02:26:18.439 --> 02:26:22.802]  It was designed to fall after it was set up with all this internal strife.
[02:26:23.822 --> 02:26:26.323]  And racial strife and strife in the family.
[02:26:26.923 --> 02:26:28.323]  And all of that, again, is declassified.
[02:26:28.383 --> 02:26:29.323]  All of that is admitted.
[02:26:29.804 --> 02:26:31.044]  My film Endgame breaks it down.
[02:26:31.084 --> 02:26:32.584]  The plan to break down the family.
[02:26:32.604 --> 02:26:34.285]  The plan to turn us against each other.
[02:26:34.305 --> 02:26:36.745]  The plan to say, don't say you have a mother and father.
[02:26:36.825 --> 02:26:38.146]  Somebody else might not have it.
[02:26:38.566 --> 02:26:39.826]  The plan to destroy free speech.
[02:26:40.726 --> 02:26:43.187]  America's not perfect, but the ideal of it...
[02:26:44.235 --> 02:26:44.975]  Changed the world!
[02:26:45.055 --> 02:26:45.896]  Empowered the planet!
[02:26:45.976 --> 02:26:47.656]  Invented most of the technologies we have!
[02:26:48.276 --> 02:26:55.799]  Because the idea of empowering humanity and innovation, the American dream just being 10% realized, created the modern world we have!
[02:26:56.999 --> 02:27:01.601]  And then it was hijacked, and turned into a system of total control.
[02:27:01.621 --> 02:27:10.604]  And the technologies were hidden, they were twisted, they were given to people like the smartphones and other things, with back doors and Trojan horse control systems.
[02:27:19.656 --> 02:27:23.699]  And they dumb the public down to where they say, he's rich, he wants to be poor.
[02:27:24.059 --> 02:27:30.445]  No, America's about wealth and empowerment and individual liberty and free association, and that creates incredible wealth.
[02:27:30.685 --> 02:27:32.626]  The problem is it then creates decadence.
[02:27:35.689 --> 02:27:37.751]  Now, they come back from break.
[02:27:38.611 --> 02:27:42.374]  We're going to go right to Trump's speech, and I'm even going to skip the part.
[02:27:43.419 --> 02:27:55.184]  At the intro to it, where he says Chief Justice Roberts and Carter and Clinton and all the rest of them, we the citizens of America are now joining a great nation effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all our people.
[02:27:55.224 --> 02:27:58.465]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.
[02:27:58.505 --> 02:27:58.905]  That's true.
[02:27:59.966 --> 02:28:03.627]  We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
[02:28:06.989 --> 02:28:12.251]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transition of power,
[02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:21.772]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their graciousness throughout this transition.
[02:28:23.328 --> 02:28:24.729]  They have been magnificent.
[02:28:25.169 --> 02:28:27.990]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:29.230]  We're going to start there.
[02:28:29.891 --> 02:28:30.171]  There.
[02:28:30.751 --> 02:28:34.053]  When we come back, on the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:34.513 --> 02:28:35.613]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:28:35.633 --> 02:28:39.895]  We're breaking down the secrets that are now being revealed of the real national treasure.
[02:28:40.255 --> 02:28:41.376]  It's not a Hollywood movie.
[02:28:41.936 --> 02:28:43.677]  What is the American dream?
[02:28:44.037 --> 02:28:45.697]  I will break it all down straight ahead.
[02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:49.099]  For I alone am your chronicler.
[02:28:49.119 --> 02:28:49.559]  Stay with us.
[02:28:53.151 --> 02:28:54.872]  I will break it all down straight ahead.
[02:28:54.892 --> 02:28:58.213]  For I alone am your chronicler.
[02:28:58.373 --> 02:29:01.834]  Stay with us.
[02:29:02.294 --> 02:29:03.674]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:29:03.934 --> 02:29:05.215]  You can't survive without it.
[02:29:05.415 --> 02:29:06.315]  But where do you get it?
[02:29:06.635 --> 02:29:12.377]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:29:12.597 --> 02:29:18.319]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[02:29:38.265 --> 02:29:39.466]  Stainless steel construction.

[02:30:07.987 --> 02:30:11.289]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:12.149 --> 02:30:18.393]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:20.174 --> 02:30:26.517]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[02:31:19.262 --> 02:31:29.172]  That's amazing.
[02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.749]  I think this video is going to trigger leptards.
[02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:49.731]  So this is a Glock 18C machine pistol.
[02:31:51.893 --> 02:31:54.054]  This fires about 11 foot-pounds.
[02:31:54.114 --> 02:31:54.935]  Pretty crazy.
[02:32:11.698 --> 02:32:13.640]  We've also got an M249 SAW.
[02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:22.707]  Wow, that's fun!
[02:32:23.147 --> 02:32:33.575]  Up against the wall, commies!
[02:32:42.621 --> 02:32:43.761]  That's amazingly cool.
[02:32:44.301 --> 02:32:45.522]  This is the best range I've ever been to.
[02:32:45.542 --> 02:32:46.663]  They got the big thing downstairs.
[02:32:46.703 --> 02:32:47.423]  They got this VIP area.
[02:32:47.463 --> 02:32:48.423]  It's a little bit more.
[02:32:48.964 --> 02:32:50.825]  And it's, you know, it's usually really busy downstairs.
[02:32:50.885 --> 02:32:53.626]  I'm up here, but... I mean, come on the weekends, it's real busy.
[02:32:53.666 --> 02:32:55.247]  But during the weekday, tag off your family.
[02:32:55.907 --> 02:32:56.427]  Come and shoot it.
[02:32:56.487 --> 02:32:57.108]  That's what we say.
[02:32:57.228 --> 02:32:58.008]  Come and shoot it.
[02:32:58.048 --> 02:32:59.569]  Instead of come and take it, come and shoot it.
[02:33:13.687 --> 02:33:14.969]  You want answers?
[02:33:15.029 --> 02:33:16.130]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:16.871 --> 02:33:18.733]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.877 --> 02:33:34.623]  Foxconn has a slave net and the suicide net is announced that they're going to build factories in the U.S.
[02:33:34.643 --> 02:33:36.045]  There won't be slaves there, obviously.
[02:33:37.005 --> 02:33:37.786]  That's under Trump.
[02:33:38.266 --> 02:33:41.449]  All those other big companies are announcing they're coming here as this accelerates.
[02:33:41.529 --> 02:33:54.640]  President Trump has declared a new Declaration of Independence for America against the multinational unelected corporations that have set up a world where it's acceptable for China to have slave factories and have us buy goods.
[02:33:56.605 --> 02:34:07.811]  Or is it acceptable for Obama to open up the borders and let people with TB, syphilis, gonorrhea, every other disease you can imagine, even wet leprosy, to come into America?
[02:34:09.599 --> 02:34:13.281]  These globalists are very evil and they look like demons being exercised yesterday.
[02:34:13.641 --> 02:34:16.263]  So let's go into John Roberts administering the oath.
[02:34:16.303 --> 02:34:19.444]  Let's go into what happened and then it'll go a little bit of the next hour.
[02:34:19.484 --> 02:34:21.805]  I want to start really just getting to this historic speech.
[02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:25.247]  I'm just going to write notes here and then have brief comments to analysis.
[02:34:25.848 --> 02:34:34.292]  But in the next few days, I'm going to shoot a special report where I break down and decode the larger meanings of what Trump's saying.
[02:34:34.332 --> 02:34:36.733]  But a lot of it's very, very boilerplate.
[02:34:36.753 --> 02:34:37.754]  I mean, it's very, very clear.
[02:34:38.865 --> 02:34:41.446]  We're going to release the secret technologies, the life extension.
[02:34:41.466 --> 02:34:43.666]  We're going to harness the secrets of the universe.
[02:34:43.706 --> 02:34:47.908]  We're going to have America lead by freedom again, not by control.
[02:34:48.488 --> 02:34:50.508]  So this isn't America relinquishing control.
[02:34:50.848 --> 02:35:00.091]  This is America recognizing and helping dismantle a corrupt world government, a corporate world government that's been set up that we've been used to create.
[02:35:00.911 --> 02:35:06.473]  So this is America getting redemption back from the crimes that we've been used
[02:35:07.335 --> 02:35:15.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor to introduce the Chief Justice of the United States, John G. Roberts Jr., who will administer the presidential oath of office.
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:16.100]  Everyone, please stand.
[02:35:54.315 --> 02:35:57.398]  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.
[02:35:58.559 --> 02:36:01.201]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[02:36:01.222 --> 02:36:05.025]  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear.
[02:36:05.445 --> 02:36:07.487]  That I will faithfully execute.
[02:36:08.128 --> 02:36:10.330]  That I will faithfully execute.
[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:13.213]  The office of President of the United States.
[02:36:13.593 --> 02:36:16.536]  The office of President of the United States.
[02:36:16.957 --> 02:36:18.919]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:21.602]  And will, to the best of my ability.
[02:36:22.002 --> 02:36:24.045]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[02:36:24.485 --> 02:36:26.267]  Preserve, protect and defend.
[02:36:26.548 --> 02:36:28.550]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:31.033]  The Constitution of the United States.
[02:36:31.193 --> 02:36:32.014]  So help me God.
[02:36:32.254 --> 02:36:33.095]  So help me God.
[02:36:33.615 --> 02:36:34.877]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:37:18.401 --> 02:37:20.083]  They look completely butthurt during all this.
[02:37:20.103 --> 02:37:21.024]  He's about to give a speech.
[02:37:21.684 --> 02:37:23.586]  And again, the real meat's coming up.
[02:37:23.626 --> 02:37:25.207]  It's going to take me months to decipher all this.
[02:37:25.247 --> 02:37:25.988]  This is so epic.
[02:37:26.748 --> 02:37:30.552]  But what you're hearing is 110% pure Americana.
[02:37:30.612 --> 02:37:31.773]  It does not get any better than this.
[02:37:31.793 --> 02:37:33.534]  It's why the elites are panicking, folks.
[02:37:33.554 --> 02:37:34.555]  That's your real indication.
[02:37:35.015 --> 02:37:36.136]  Humanity's unstoppable.
[02:37:36.557 --> 02:37:37.898]  Our innovation is incredible.
[02:37:38.859 --> 02:37:41.701]  But again, the elite do not want the general public to have access to all this.
[02:37:41.741 --> 02:37:42.422]  It's very, very greedy.
[02:37:43.626 --> 02:37:53.692]  It's a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever, anywhere, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump.
[02:37:54.333 --> 02:38:01.077]  And again, folks, you've heard a lot of this already on the show, and you don't have time to ask, why was it so much this InfoWars?
[02:38:01.337 --> 02:38:01.978]  It's not InfoWars.
[02:38:02.438 --> 02:38:03.259]  It's Americana.
[02:38:03.679 --> 02:38:05.880]  Here's President 45, now President.
[02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:06.861]  Said it couldn't happen.
[02:38:07.061 --> 02:38:08.182]  Told you two years ago it was gonna happen.
[02:38:18.936 --> 02:38:19.777]  Thank you all, Infowarriors.
[02:38:19.817 --> 02:38:34.649]  Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world, thank you.
[02:38:34.690 --> 02:38:40.274]  Now he, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort
[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:53.843]  To rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[02:38:54.043 --> 02:38:54.763]  God's promise.
[02:38:55.323 --> 02:38:56.324]  Now he says every four years we gather.
[02:38:56.344 --> 02:39:03.767]  Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[02:39:05.347 --> 02:39:06.948]  We will face challenges.
[02:39:07.568 --> 02:39:09.229]  We will confront hardships.
[02:39:09.849 --> 02:39:11.850]  But we will get the job done.
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:19.562]  Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
[02:39:20.682 --> 02:39:31.306]  And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
[02:39:31.326 --> 02:39:32.546]  The truth is they didn't pardon Hillary.
[02:39:32.566 --> 02:39:34.307]  They have been magnificent.
[02:39:34.447 --> 02:39:35.607]  Hillary and Soros fighting.
[02:39:35.627 --> 02:39:36.548]  Obama actually set it out.
[02:39:36.588 --> 02:39:39.389]  I don't want to give him credit, but I'm going to let you know the inside intel.
[02:39:39.469 --> 02:39:40.269]  Obama backed off.
[02:39:42.622 --> 02:39:46.925]  Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.
[02:39:47.845 --> 02:39:53.969]  Because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another.
[02:39:54.029 --> 02:39:54.689]  Back to the people.
[02:39:54.709 --> 02:39:56.230]  Or from one party to another.
[02:39:56.911 --> 02:40:01.013]  But we are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[02:40:01.594 --> 02:40:04.736]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:40:05.436 --> 02:40:06.417]  We the people, folks.
[02:40:06.457 --> 02:40:08.038]  This is Americana Reboot.
[02:40:08.178 --> 02:40:09.218]  You are witnessing history.
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:11.600]  Unbelievable.
[02:40:13.393 --> 02:40:23.450]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.
[02:40:25.828 --> 02:40:31.532]  Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
[02:40:32.533 --> 02:40:38.678]  Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
[02:40:40.719 --> 02:40:43.281]  The establishment protected itself.
[02:40:43.582 --> 02:40:43.922]  That's right.
[02:40:44.062 --> 02:40:46.263]  But not the citizens of our country.
[02:40:46.383 --> 02:40:47.423]  They left in fantasy land.
[02:40:47.543 --> 02:40:50.524]  Their victories have not been your victories.
[02:40:50.704 --> 02:40:51.004]  Exactly.
[02:40:51.204 --> 02:40:54.105]  Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.
[02:40:54.645 --> 02:41:05.748]  And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
[02:41:07.288 --> 02:41:08.168]  Unlimited wealth, they have.
[02:41:08.909 --> 02:41:10.369]  With the technology, folks, we could have anything.
[02:41:11.539 --> 02:41:15.222]  That all changes starting right here.
[02:41:15.242 --> 02:41:16.003]  Right now.
[02:41:16.123 --> 02:41:16.923]  And right now.
[02:41:17.704 --> 02:41:20.106]  Because this moment is your moment.
[02:41:20.246 --> 02:41:22.128]  It belongs to you.
[02:41:22.248 --> 02:41:23.549]  Not the state, but the people.
[02:41:23.989 --> 02:41:24.490]  You just did it.
[02:41:25.310 --> 02:41:25.751]  You did this.
[02:41:27.386 --> 02:41:29.267]  Folks, they've got actuaries.
[02:41:29.427 --> 02:41:35.531]  It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
[02:41:36.191 --> 02:41:37.272]  This is your day.
[02:41:38.032 --> 02:41:39.473]  This is your celebration.
[02:41:40.293 --> 02:41:45.717]  And this, the United States of America, is your country.
[02:41:46.017 --> 02:41:46.477]  That's right.
[02:41:46.517 --> 02:41:47.898]  The globalists had conquered America.
[02:41:47.918 --> 02:41:48.658]  They'd hijacked it.
[02:41:48.698 --> 02:41:51.560]  We now have peacefully had a countercoup and restored it.
[02:41:52.822 --> 02:42:01.545]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[02:42:01.605 --> 02:42:02.045]  And pause.
[02:42:03.706 --> 02:42:04.946]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:42:04.986 --> 02:42:06.347]  When we come back, we'll continue there.
[02:42:06.827 --> 02:42:09.348]  It just gets more epic if you know what you're hearing.
[02:42:10.688 --> 02:42:12.469]  For the first time ever, this isn't about parties.
[02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:14.909]  This is about who controls the government.
[02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:19.171]  It's about do they stand with the people and prosperity and the Bill of Rights and the Constitution?
[02:42:19.411 --> 02:42:22.052]  What do they actually do instead of a bunch of infighting?
[02:42:23.476 --> 02:42:25.317]  And then he goes into racially coming together.
[02:42:25.377 --> 02:42:27.498]  And by the way, the Trump plan's public.
[02:42:28.499 --> 02:42:29.840]  They just always took it out of context.
[02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:36.664]  I've met people that have been here 20 years legally that can't become citizens because the Republicans and Democrats made it almost impossible.
[02:42:37.024 --> 02:42:41.787]  They want you illegal poor as a new permanent underclass who they control.
[02:42:41.927 --> 02:42:42.508]  No, no, no.
[02:42:42.908 --> 02:42:45.109]  Under Trump, you don't have a criminal record, you're hard working.
[02:42:45.569 --> 02:42:49.672]  No matter what color you are, you're here a year or so, you work hard, you do good stuff, boom!
[02:42:50.112 --> 02:42:50.933]  Boom, you're right in.
[02:42:52.253 --> 02:42:53.134]  You're a felon, you're gone.
[02:43:03.109 --> 02:43:04.749]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:43:04.769 --> 02:43:05.690]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:20.393]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:43:20.413 --> 02:43:27.955]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:43:28.035 --> 02:43:28.536]  Well, thank you.
[02:43:28.576 --> 02:43:33.500]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[02:43:33.521 --> 02:43:36.103]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[02:43:36.483 --> 02:43:39.406]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[02:43:39.787 --> 02:43:45.913]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:43:46.073 --> 02:43:48.736]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:43:49.236 --> 02:43:55.808]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:43:56.149 --> 02:44:00.697]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:04.853 --> 02:44:10.395]  Gavin McInnes joins us, syndicated radio and TV host, former founder of Vice, you name it.
[02:44:10.436 --> 02:44:15.378]  But just, it's going into overdrive, the desperation with this Russia crap.
[02:44:15.438 --> 02:44:17.919]  And I used to laugh at it, but man, I'm not laughing anymore.
[02:44:17.959 --> 02:44:22.421]  They have intelligence committee hearings, House committee hearings, and they say, those are the Russian agents.
[02:44:23.618 --> 02:44:26.240]  No proof, no judge, no indictment, no FBI at my office.
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:29.642]  Just total lies, like saying I'm an Easter Bunny from Pluto.
[02:44:29.722 --> 02:44:30.643]  They never know when to quit.
[02:44:30.663 --> 02:44:31.484]  They're just getting crazy.
[02:44:31.864 --> 02:44:33.525]  Gavin McInnes, what do you think's going on here?
[02:44:33.545 --> 02:44:35.567]  Well, we're seeing the progression of lunacy.
[02:44:35.607 --> 02:44:39.029]  I mean, over the past year, it started with fake news.
[02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:42.552]  And then I stopped saying that because it wasn't just fake, it was deranged.
[02:44:42.592 --> 02:44:44.333]  So I called it mentally ill news.
[02:44:44.834 --> 02:44:47.756]  And now, it's crazy ex-girlfriend news.
[02:44:48.196 --> 02:44:50.678]  Where she goes, I know you were with that Russian chick.
[02:44:51.138 --> 02:44:52.239]  And you go, what are you talking about?
[02:44:52.259 --> 02:44:54.281]  I just went out for beers with Matt.
[02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:59.866]  Yeah, Matt was talking to someone else, talking to Alex, and Alex was talking to that Russian chick.
[02:45:00.107 --> 02:45:04.170]  So you're with her now, and you go, wow, you deluded lady.
[02:45:04.291 --> 02:45:05.792]  Please stop coming to my work.
[02:45:05.812 --> 02:45:09.015]  Please stop screaming at me about people you think I was with.
[02:45:09.295 --> 02:45:12.238]  Meanwhile, by the way, she's in bed with a Russian.
[02:45:12.258 --> 02:45:12.919]  Like, for all this
[02:45:13.399 --> 02:45:14.980]  Scrutiny, the left demands.
[02:45:15.260 --> 02:45:22.384]  You turn the tables to them and you point the mirror at them and we find out, oh, she's on Craigslist setting up Russian gangbangs.
[02:45:22.484 --> 02:45:25.806]  We've got Russians setting up ads on Facebook.
[02:45:25.826 --> 02:45:28.828]  We've got lies about the Trump prostitute dossier.
[02:45:29.108 --> 02:45:38.093]  So every time they get just a taste of what they put us through, they're exposed for the perverts and the colluders and the election riggers that they are.
[02:45:38.453 --> 02:45:38.833]  You're right.
[02:45:38.853 --> 02:45:41.035]  They've reached crazy ex-girlfriend level.
[02:45:41.055 --> 02:45:49.862]  The New York Post did a feature today about a threesome I had in 1994, saying that we're bragging about sexual encounters.
[02:45:50.183 --> 02:45:52.004]  Yeah, sorry I got laid when I was 24.
[02:45:52.364 --> 02:45:52.965]  I'm 47 now.
[02:45:53.646 --> 02:45:55.167]  Oh, the same thing.
[02:45:55.187 --> 02:45:59.991]  They're digging through everything in the world just looking for somebody to tell lies, and it's all like, Jones had a lot of girlfriends.
[02:46:00.671 --> 02:46:02.052]  I mean, it's like, what do they got?
[02:46:02.173 --> 02:46:02.473]  Nothing.
[02:46:02.913 --> 02:46:03.413]  Sorry!
[02:46:03.433 --> 02:46:05.734]  Steven Seagal was in the news today.
[02:46:06.394 --> 02:46:09.415]  In 1991, he asked a woman to sit on his face.
[02:46:11.056 --> 02:46:12.516]  Oh my God!
[02:46:12.816 --> 02:46:13.877]  Stop the presses!
[02:46:14.977 --> 02:46:19.338]  I thought we were going through the normal stages of, what do you call it, death?
[02:46:19.438 --> 02:46:19.939]  Despair?
[02:46:20.239 --> 02:46:25.760]  Where it's denial, and then it's depression, and then it's anger, and it's acceptance.
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:27.041]  I forget the exact degrees.
[02:46:27.341 --> 02:46:30.562]  But we started out with those, but we didn't go to the next one.
[02:46:30.802 --> 02:46:34.685]  They just kept going on the crazy one, and it's gotten crazier and crazier.
[02:46:34.705 --> 02:46:35.985]  They're getting people fired.
[02:46:36.266 --> 02:46:37.386]  They're making up lies.
[02:46:37.947 --> 02:46:41.189]  I think the way it ends is riots.
[02:46:41.489 --> 02:46:44.611]  It really has to end there, because there's no rationale here.
[02:46:44.651 --> 02:46:45.852]  They refuse to talk to you.
[02:46:46.092 --> 02:46:48.053]  They hate free speech.
[02:46:48.093 --> 02:46:52.276]  They don't want to give Nazis a platform, and a Nazi is anyone that likes Trump.
[02:46:52.756 --> 02:46:54.538]  So you go, well, I can't rational.
[02:46:54.778 --> 02:46:56.439]  I can't ration with you.
[02:46:56.479 --> 02:46:59.261]  You're out of your goddamn mind.
[02:47:07.962 --> 02:47:14.289]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:20.455]  Look, the enemy media has already figured out that we can see for thousands of miles.
[02:47:20.495 --> 02:47:24.740]  They've already figured out that we're not playing games.
[02:47:28.399 --> 02:47:30.280]  Keep it rolling for a minute.
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:44.726]  You can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[02:47:44.766 --> 02:47:46.347]  I mean, this show's not talk, folks.
[02:47:46.387 --> 02:47:47.267]  This is a real deal.
[02:47:47.287 --> 02:47:48.468]  This is Americana.
[02:47:49.665 --> 02:47:58.220]  I can't believe how honored I am to be 100% Americana and to be in the zeitgeist and to be part of the plan to launch humanity to the stars.
[02:47:59.522 --> 02:48:00.023]  I got good will!
[02:48:02.175 --> 02:48:03.216]  I want to empower you.
[02:48:03.416 --> 02:48:05.477]  I don't want to put you down so I can rule over you.
[02:48:05.497 --> 02:48:10.321]  I don't have a competition in me that if somebody else is doing well, I want to destroy them.
[02:48:11.362 --> 02:48:15.025]  I want you to do well as long as it's not at my expense.
[02:48:15.686 --> 02:48:20.510]  And with the large yes in the non-zero-sum game, the 360 win as I call it,
[02:48:21.130 --> 02:48:22.152]  We have a technology.
[02:48:22.232 --> 02:48:22.712]  It's there.
[02:48:23.073 --> 02:48:28.220]  In fact, there's more than you could ever imagine or want to do with what this species can do.
[02:48:28.461 --> 02:48:34.749]  Look how far we've come from the fire and the wheel, the spacecraft, and all the medicine we have.
[02:48:35.728 --> 02:48:43.015]  And the biggest thing from his speech is America's ideas and culture, that's what's going to make us dominate worldwide.
[02:48:43.035 --> 02:48:47.619]  But in free trade and openness, globalism is all about making people poor.
[02:48:48.319 --> 02:48:51.943]  Nico was just telling me, he said, hey boss, you know, you skip a lot of breaks, you never plug anything.
[02:48:52.363 --> 02:48:53.684]  The network's the ones that run all the ends.
[02:48:54.265 --> 02:48:55.005]  You want to plug something?
[02:48:55.025 --> 02:48:57.328]  Yeah, we're running a special that ends today.
[02:48:57.868 --> 02:48:59.029]  We've been running since Christmas.
[02:48:59.049 --> 02:49:01.711]  We extended it to call it the Inauguration Special.

[02:49:26.629 --> 02:49:29.891]  We have the amazing Nanotech Body Armor, only available to the military.
[02:49:32.025 --> 02:49:43.733]  You know what the crazy part about meeting people in the military who are big listeners and fighting for this country and fighting for Trump, is that they don't even tell you don't talk about it.
[02:49:46.815 --> 02:49:50.638]  And it's so crazy that you can't even tell people.
[02:49:51.098 --> 02:49:53.120]  I mean, some of it got caught on tape when I was in DC.
[02:49:54.875 --> 02:49:56.957]  One guy, he looked like The Flash.
[02:49:57.677 --> 02:49:59.258]  Or who's the guy that's real fast?
[02:49:59.899 --> 02:50:01.320]  It was like Ant-Man, but who's the guy?
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:02.060]  The Flash.
[02:50:02.701 --> 02:50:05.703]  It's like this guy's attacking me and all of a sudden people are like, is that real?
[02:50:06.303 --> 02:50:06.543]  Boom!
[02:50:06.563 --> 02:50:07.344]  Knocked this guy down.
[02:50:09.185 --> 02:50:14.228]  And then it's like... It's like, is that even real?
[02:50:14.689 --> 02:50:14.849]  Like...
[02:50:16.451 --> 02:50:18.653]  Oh, we're just here to help you, protect you, because there's a threat against you.
[02:50:19.153 --> 02:50:20.754]  And then after they leave, they're like, you know who that was?
[02:50:20.774 --> 02:50:21.615]  I'm like, no, I don't know.
[02:50:21.795 --> 02:50:23.276]  Well, that's such and such.
[02:50:23.477 --> 02:50:29.601]  It's like... It's like... They are hitting us with polonium and killing people, though, every day.
[02:50:29.641 --> 02:50:41.410]  I mean, so, to actually watch the real American government come in, like, Alex, you're crazy enough to come down here, watch what happens, and then, boom, it's like... I mean, I'm a tough guy, okay?
[02:50:42.491 --> 02:50:44.373]  These guys would probably kick my ass in about 30 seconds.
[02:50:46.098 --> 02:50:50.642]  And it's just so crazy to be in the heart of the American dream now.
[02:50:51.623 --> 02:50:52.904]  And it's so real.
[02:50:52.984 --> 02:50:54.505]  Everybody can feel it and see it.
[02:50:55.786 --> 02:50:57.768]  I gotta get to this because Leon's come up in about 20 minutes.
[02:50:58.609 --> 02:51:00.370]  There's like 13 minutes left to his speech.
[02:51:00.430 --> 02:51:00.991]  It's so epic.
[02:51:01.431 --> 02:51:04.113]  Let's hear some more of this and I'll try to limit my comments.
[02:51:04.133 --> 02:51:05.575]  But this is such an amazing time to be alive.
[02:51:05.915 --> 02:51:11.680]  Here's Trump being inaugurated 48 hours ago right there in the District of Criminals as he turns the tide.
[02:51:14.696 --> 02:51:23.499]  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
[02:51:24.259 --> 02:51:24.739]  That's it.
[02:51:25.059 --> 02:51:25.759]  For the people.
[02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:30.221]  You've never heard that.
[02:51:30.501 --> 02:51:39.064]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[02:51:39.304 --> 02:51:39.584]  Pause.
[02:51:39.624 --> 02:51:40.024]  Back it up.
[02:51:42.439 --> 02:51:44.661]  January 20th is the new July 4th.
[02:51:45.341 --> 02:51:53.608]  If we deliver on this, if this happens, if we're moral and good and work hard and do this, in a hundred years it'll be celebrated as bigger than July 4th.
[02:51:55.009 --> 02:51:55.630]  It's a fact.
[02:51:56.530 --> 02:51:57.791]  But Trump isn't doing this selfishly.
[02:51:57.831 --> 02:52:00.413]  He loves his kids, his grandkids, and the kids that come after that.
[02:52:00.854 --> 02:52:02.295]  He understands the continuum.
[02:52:04.917 --> 02:52:06.959]  He understands how big this is.
[02:52:07.479 --> 02:52:09.521]  And that globalism is designed to make us poor,
[02:52:11.331 --> 02:52:12.592]  All we gotta do is turn that off.
[02:52:12.632 --> 02:52:13.813]  It's not that he's even perfect.
[02:52:14.173 --> 02:52:18.497]  Again, Donald Trump, mark this down, is not out to get you.
[02:52:19.477 --> 02:52:32.768]  And he has a vision, and he loves America, and he knows about the secret destiny, which in days to come I'll lay out fully, but believe me, folks, life extension technologies alone, saying we have them, we're gonna give them to you, that's come up in a moment.
[02:52:34.509 --> 02:52:38.152]  Yes, people that own chemotherapy patents are not gonna make any more money.
[02:52:38.432 --> 02:52:40.093]  They already made hundreds of billions.
[02:52:40.214 --> 02:52:40.574]  Shut up.
[02:52:42.807 --> 02:52:44.448]  They're like, well, what do we do when people can live to 200?
[02:52:44.528 --> 02:52:45.708]  It's gonna happen.
[02:52:45.888 --> 02:52:47.049]  We'll figure it out, okay?
[02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:48.769]  But then we won't be in control of it.
[02:52:48.809 --> 02:52:51.790]  I mean, the public, a bunch of dumbasses, we can't give it to them.
[02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:53.091]  You made them dumb!
[02:52:53.891 --> 02:52:54.831]  How about you die?
[02:52:54.851 --> 02:52:58.213]  I don't want to kill you, but stop saying we gotta die!
[02:52:59.633 --> 02:53:01.914]  We're gonna get some of this dirt, dammit!
[02:53:02.134 --> 02:53:03.935]  We built it, we made it, stop it!
[02:53:05.663 --> 02:53:07.964]  Latin America and Africa should be jewels!
[02:53:08.404 --> 02:53:09.645]  Those are strong, good people.
[02:53:09.905 --> 02:53:12.726]  They've been suppressed, never got out from under colonialism.
[02:53:13.006 --> 02:53:14.307]  We're gonna end that!
[02:53:14.787 --> 02:53:17.708]  And you turn loose the superstorm of human potential.
[02:53:17.908 --> 02:53:19.329]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:53:19.349 --> 02:53:21.110]  That spirit's right.
[02:53:21.130 --> 02:53:22.070]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[02:53:23.635 --> 02:53:27.097]  Just because I don't want to be condescending like, oh, I like gay people or I like black people.
[02:53:27.437 --> 02:53:27.797]  Oh, really?
[02:53:27.817 --> 02:53:28.758]  Some of them are your best friends.
[02:53:29.218 --> 02:53:33.941]  I was out there and there were Indians and black people and Hispanics and people coming up speaking on the microphone.
[02:53:33.961 --> 02:53:35.962]  There were these live feeds that were so eloquent.
[02:53:36.002 --> 02:53:40.205]  Their spirits were so strong that I didn't feel weak that I was next to a spirit so strong.
[02:53:40.285 --> 02:53:43.587]  I felt good like, oh, thank God there's people out there that get it.
[02:53:43.707 --> 02:53:45.248]  I just love them so much.
[02:53:46.798 --> 02:53:50.439]  And it didn't matter what color their skin was, even though, quite frankly, I tried to get the best tan I could get.
[02:53:50.459 --> 02:53:51.719]  I thought their dark skin looked great.
[02:53:52.339 --> 02:53:57.241]  The point was, is I love them as fellow humans, and they were my brothers and sisters because they got it.
[02:53:57.681 --> 02:54:05.663]  And most of the people I saw that were minorities, they totally understood it and rejected it from the Kenyan driver of my SUV back at the airport.
[02:54:06.423 --> 02:54:10.869]  To the Mexican driver that picked me up, to everybody I met, it was like they were free.
[02:54:10.889 --> 02:54:22.183]  But let me tell you, if I saw some black man or Hispanic or whatever person who looked good and was strong and had strength and had light in their eyes, I knew before I talked to them they'd love me or agree with me.
[02:54:22.543 --> 02:54:25.567]  But if I saw somebody who looked like their soul had been sucked out, they hated me.
[02:54:25.827 --> 02:54:26.628]  It's spiritual!
[02:54:27.068 --> 02:54:32.995]  It's what's in our hearts, and what's in these people's hearts that love God and liberty is the same as mine, the same as in Trump.
[02:54:33.035 --> 02:54:33.776]  He feels it!
[02:54:34.237 --> 02:54:36.439]  He wants to be the one that delivers us!
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:38.682]  He wants to be the new Moses!
[02:54:38.982 --> 02:54:40.084]  He wants to do it!
[02:54:42.645 --> 02:54:45.307]  And I don't even want to sit here and say this, but the truth's the truth!
[02:54:45.707 --> 02:54:50.730]  Donald Trump's so good, ladies and gentlemen, that I don't even know if we deserve him.
[02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:52.591]  He is so frickin' strong.
[02:54:52.831 --> 02:54:54.171]  He's so high on the spirit.
[02:54:54.372 --> 02:55:03.056]  He works 20 hours a day without even coffee, and he can't stop working, and he just sees every—it's incredible.
[02:55:03.977 --> 02:55:05.658]  He's a modern prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:07.602 --> 02:55:08.523]  We've only got a few minutes to break.
[02:55:08.563 --> 02:55:12.105]  I'm going to go as long as I have to to finish this before Leanne comes in, but let's just go back to it.
[02:55:12.125 --> 02:55:17.109]  Here it is.
[02:55:17.129 --> 02:55:28.197]  January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
[02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:29.418]  July 4th, part two.
[02:55:32.603 --> 02:55:34.323]  True collectivism, our will together.
[02:55:34.343 --> 02:55:39.705]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[02:55:39.725 --> 02:55:43.146]  They've turned us against each other so we don't join wills together.
[02:55:43.166 --> 02:55:45.346]  See, they have a false collectivism.
[02:55:45.426 --> 02:55:56.969]  The real thing is... You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
[02:55:56.989 --> 02:55:58.309]  You back Trump, you go to the stars.
[02:55:58.370 --> 02:55:59.730]  You don't, genocide and death.
[02:56:00.470 --> 02:56:02.731]  And the elite are crazy to merge with computers.
[02:56:02.831 --> 02:56:10.913]  This movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
[02:56:11.733 --> 02:56:19.995]  Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
[02:56:22.279 --> 02:56:29.442]  These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people.
[02:56:29.462 --> 02:56:30.562]  It's the social contract!
[02:56:31.462 --> 02:56:32.563]  You gotta give it to us!
[02:56:32.603 --> 02:56:36.004]  Too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
[02:56:36.964 --> 02:56:40.786]  Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities.
[02:56:41.646 --> 02:56:46.348]  Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape.
[02:56:47.188 --> 02:56:47.828]  Of our nation.
[02:56:48.729 --> 02:56:58.274]  An education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
[02:56:59.955 --> 02:57:11.061]  And the crime, and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
[02:57:12.273 --> 02:57:19.560]  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:22.823]  See, sounds like talk, but if you invoke it, you will have it.
[02:57:23.323 --> 02:57:25.045]  See, he knows, he says, you have the power.
[02:57:25.445 --> 02:57:27.988]  I need you to step into your destiny.
[02:57:28.703 --> 02:57:31.907]  We are one nation, and they're... Yeah, one nation.
[02:57:31.927 --> 02:57:34.550]  They keep saying divide, divide, that we're dividing.
[02:57:36.272 --> 02:57:37.033]  We'll be back, folks.
[02:57:37.714 --> 02:57:39.156]  I'm gonna do two more segments to play this.
[02:57:39.176 --> 02:57:42.300]  He's getting into the suppressed technologies next.
[02:57:51.351 --> 02:58:00.034]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:58:00.094 --> 02:58:00.574]  That's right.
[02:58:00.634 --> 02:58:05.635]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[02:58:05.895 --> 02:58:12.377]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[02:58:12.577 --> 02:58:13.298]  And let me tell you something.
[02:58:13.418 --> 02:58:19.880]  It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts and entire meals.
[02:58:20.420 --> 02:58:21.220]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:30.026]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:58:30.166 --> 02:58:39.412]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:58:39.772 --> 02:58:43.095]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:58:43.215 --> 02:58:47.177]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:58:47.337 --> 02:58:48.238]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:58:48.398 --> 02:58:50.980]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:52.048 --> 02:58:52.769]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:52.789 --> 02:59:02.415]  The new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:59:02.995 --> 02:59:08.179]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:59:08.499 --> 02:59:11.301]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:59:11.521 --> 02:59:20.267]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:59:22.388 --> 02:59:30.475]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:59:30.595 --> 02:59:41.505]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:59:41.985 --> 02:59:43.266]  It is amazing!
[02:59:44.668 --> 02:59:49.652]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:59:53.843 --> 02:59:59.807]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:04.711 --> 03:00:09.554]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:09.574 --> 03:00:10.515]  Watch me!
[03:00:11.715 --> 03:00:12.396]  Watch me!
[03:00:13.577 --> 03:00:14.417]  I got something!
[03:00:15.598 --> 03:00:16.259]  Watch me!
[03:00:16.819 --> 03:00:17.199]  Yeah!
[03:00:17.599 --> 03:00:18.100]  I got it!
[03:00:18.940 --> 03:00:19.341]  Hey!
[03:00:20.503 --> 03:00:22.603]  I got somethin' that makes me wanna shout!
[03:00:24.004 --> 03:00:26.944]  I got somethin' that tells me what it's all about!
[03:00:26.964 --> 03:00:29.125]  I got soul!
[03:00:29.605 --> 03:00:30.525]  And I'm super bad!
[03:00:30.545 --> 03:00:31.425]  Super bad!
[03:00:32.306 --> 03:00:34.886]  I got somethin' that tells me what it's all about!
[03:00:34.906 --> 03:00:35.746]  I got soul!
[03:00:36.106 --> 03:00:37.147]  And I'm super bad!
[03:00:37.567 --> 03:00:39.147]  And I'm super bad!
[03:00:39.427 --> 03:00:40.087]  Feels so good!
[03:00:41.408 --> 03:00:45.529]  Now I got a move that tells me what to do!
[03:00:46.109 --> 03:00:47.169]  Sometimes I tease!
[03:00:48.349 --> 03:00:50.091]  Got a move that tells me what to do.
[03:00:50.872 --> 03:00:54.977]  I think Trump's got a move that tells him what to do, and he knows the devil when he sees it.
[03:00:55.958 --> 03:00:59.262]  The devil doesn't want you to do good, wants to trick you, wants to run your life.
[03:00:59.502 --> 03:01:01.404]  God wants to empower you and see you grow.
[03:01:01.845 --> 03:01:04.968]  Let's go back to the epic speech of President Trump.
[03:01:04.988 --> 03:01:05.309]  Here it is.
[03:01:07.751 --> 03:01:11.573]  We are one nation, and their pain is our pain.
[03:01:12.253 --> 03:01:17.955]  Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.
[03:01:17.975 --> 03:01:18.995]  We're all connected.
[03:01:19.096 --> 03:01:25.178]  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
[03:01:25.818 --> 03:01:26.498]  Now that's the key.
[03:01:26.819 --> 03:01:32.421]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[03:01:38.442 --> 03:01:40.623]  For many decades.
[03:01:42.063 --> 03:01:44.424]  This oath of office is an allegiance to you.
[03:01:46.105 --> 03:01:46.745]  No president.
[03:01:47.105 --> 03:01:47.645]  This is it.
[03:01:47.665 --> 03:01:50.186]  That's what he tells you personally and on air.
[03:01:50.206 --> 03:01:51.666]  I'm not going to let you down.
[03:01:51.726 --> 03:01:52.887]  I'm fully committed to you.
[03:01:53.007 --> 03:01:54.067]  I'm going to do the best I can.
[03:01:54.087 --> 03:01:54.687]  And he doesn't.
[03:01:56.128 --> 03:01:58.289]  And I can't believe how dumb the leftists were out on the trail.
[03:01:58.309 --> 03:02:00.109]  They don't think Trump brought any jobs back.
[03:02:00.329 --> 03:02:02.030]  When he was president-elect, he was already doing it.
[03:02:02.050 --> 03:02:02.490]  Let's go back.
[03:02:03.626 --> 03:02:16.069]  We've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
[03:02:17.249 --> 03:02:22.691]  We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
[03:02:29.233 --> 03:02:40.115]  And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
[03:02:41.596 --> 03:02:52.598]  We've made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
[03:02:54.557 --> 03:02:58.659]  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores.
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:07.405]  With not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
[03:03:08.745 --> 03:03:18.351]  The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
[03:03:18.431 --> 03:03:20.112]  Which is what globalism admitted it was.
[03:03:20.152 --> 03:03:21.393]  But that is the past.
[03:03:22.478 --> 03:03:26.581]  And now we are looking only to the future.
[03:03:26.941 --> 03:03:27.622]  America first.
[03:03:28.342 --> 03:03:30.804]  Which means build ourselves up, be independent, then help others.
[03:03:31.384 --> 03:03:34.086]  Not have capitulation dictated to us.
[03:03:36.187 --> 03:03:46.650]  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
[03:03:46.670 --> 03:03:47.670]  America first.
[03:03:47.730 --> 03:03:53.252]  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[03:03:53.892 --> 03:04:00.794]  From this day forward, it's going to be only America first.
[03:04:01.534 --> 03:04:03.275]  America first.
[03:04:07.273 --> 03:04:08.293]  This means humanity first.
[03:04:09.394 --> 03:04:21.558]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[03:04:22.238 --> 03:04:32.882]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[03:04:36.667 --> 03:04:37.368]  We're going to come back.
[03:04:38.709 --> 03:04:42.312]  So America first, which just simply means we won't be slaves of the globalists.
[03:04:42.552 --> 03:04:50.918]  We're going to come back, finish up with a speech, and I'm going to detail how these big women's marches are openly run by the CIA, and it's hijacked by foreign powers.
[03:04:51.359 --> 03:04:54.181]  Can Trump clean up the CIA, or will he fail?
[03:04:54.761 --> 03:04:56.263]  All this and more straight ahead.
[03:04:56.863 --> 03:04:58.064]  Do you want the cancer cures?
[03:04:58.905 --> 03:05:00.106]  The question is up to you.
[03:05:05.879 --> 03:05:11.722]  B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:05:12.743 --> 03:05:20.687]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:05:21.507 --> 03:05:26.530]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:05:29.131 --> 03:05:34.175]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:05:34.756 --> 03:05:35.096]  Secret 12.
[03:05:36.577 --> 03:05:37.478]  Optimal absorption.
[03:05:37.738 --> 03:05:42.462]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:05:42.883 --> 03:05:47.086]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:05:48.067 --> 03:05:48.807]  Optimum levels.
[03:05:50.229 --> 03:05:54.051]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[03:05:54.391 --> 03:05:58.734]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[03:05:59.555 --> 03:06:00.796]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:06:14.475 --> 03:06:20.784]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.374 --> 03:06:29.797]  This will be a day long remembered.
[03:06:29.857 --> 03:06:30.538]  We've seen the end
[03:06:31.775 --> 03:06:35.136]  We'll soon see the end of the globe.
[03:06:35.196 --> 03:06:40.717]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:06:40.737 --> 03:06:41.677]  It's not true.
[03:06:41.717 --> 03:06:43.698]  That's impossible!
[03:06:43.898 --> 03:06:45.718]  Search your feelings.
[03:06:45.758 --> 03:06:48.479]  You know it to be true.
[03:07:09.613 --> 03:07:14.076]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:07:14.096 --> 03:07:16.058]  Move bitch!
[03:07:16.098 --> 03:07:16.979]  Get out the way!
[03:07:21.605 --> 03:07:23.807]  And that flag is the American flag!
[03:07:23.847 --> 03:07:28.611]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:07:28.751 --> 03:07:32.414]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:07:32.494 --> 03:07:33.935]  I will not let you down.
[03:07:34.055 --> 03:07:37.438]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:07:37.658 --> 03:07:40.420]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:42.542]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:07:42.582 --> 03:07:47.826]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:07:48.007 --> 03:07:49.468]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:07:49.608 --> 03:07:50.809]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:07:53.052 --> 03:07:56.393]  Well, folks, we are impressed with Donald Trump and what he's done.
[03:07:56.413 --> 03:08:12.360]  He's a pro-human, pro-liberty president, and right as world government was openly being announced, like a phoenix under the fire of hell, our republic is rising again.
[03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:19.122]  I want to finish up with his historic inaugural speech, January 20th, Friday, 2017.
[03:08:19.223 --> 03:08:22.144]  We're going to come back and get into
[03:08:23.447 --> 03:08:26.831]  The Globalist counter-offensive, how they hope to enslave humanity.
[03:08:26.851 --> 03:08:33.518]  But he gets to the key points here about life-extension technology and other technologies that are going to be deployed to the public.
[03:08:33.538 --> 03:08:36.141]  And I can tell you, many of these are suppressed.
[03:08:36.622 --> 03:08:37.703]  They're seen as disruptive.
[03:08:38.744 --> 03:08:40.746]  And it will be disruptive when people can easily live to 200.
[03:08:40.806 --> 03:08:43.229]  But that's the big secret.
[03:08:43.389 --> 03:08:43.930]  Let's go to it.
[03:08:50.851 --> 03:09:03.020]  Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
[03:09:03.681 --> 03:09:14.349]  We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.
[03:09:21.727 --> 03:09:25.129]  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
[03:09:26.470 --> 03:09:34.555]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.
[03:09:34.575 --> 03:09:45.282]  America will start winning again, winning like never before.
[03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:51.401]  We will bring back our jobs.
[03:09:52.341 --> 03:09:54.402]  We will bring back our borders.
[03:09:55.223 --> 03:09:57.204]  We will bring back our wealth.
[03:09:57.924 --> 03:10:01.066]  And we will bring back our dreams.
[03:10:07.669 --> 03:10:17.914]  We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
[03:10:19.611 --> 03:10:23.854]  We will get our people off of welfare and back to work.
[03:10:24.434 --> 03:10:29.357]  Rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
[03:10:32.359 --> 03:10:33.180]  Who to sabotage?
[03:10:34.381 --> 03:10:36.602]  We will follow two simple rules.
[03:10:37.423 --> 03:10:40.585]  Buy American and hire American.
[03:10:41.982 --> 03:10:57.575]  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
[03:10:58.937 --> 03:11:02.620]  We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone.
[03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:06.524]  But rather, to let it shine as an example.
[03:11:06.724 --> 03:11:10.728]  We will shine for everyone to follow.
[03:11:11.008 --> 03:11:12.290]  Yeah, America didn't need to take over.
[03:11:12.330 --> 03:11:13.571]  We just had the best.
[03:11:15.051 --> 03:11:23.835]  We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism.
[03:11:23.855 --> 03:11:24.575]  Which is cancer.
[03:11:24.595 --> 03:11:28.797]  Which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.
[03:11:28.817 --> 03:11:29.077]  Huge.
[03:11:29.844 --> 03:11:31.566]  The left is totally allied with it, I was there.
[03:11:32.346 --> 03:11:35.689]  They admit like the Million Woman March was run by the Muslims.
[03:11:35.709 --> 03:11:41.094]  The bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America.
[03:11:41.674 --> 03:11:48.701]  And through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
[03:11:49.061 --> 03:11:49.561]  That's right.
[03:11:50.242 --> 03:11:56.407]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[03:11:56.568 --> 03:11:56.908]  That's right.
[03:11:59.369 --> 03:12:02.550]  Just because the left is doing all this anti-white stuff, people need to not buy into that.
[03:12:03.170 --> 03:12:04.810]  Because you want these people to win, you better come together.
[03:12:04.850 --> 03:12:12.552]  The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[03:12:13.532 --> 03:12:21.874]  We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, and always pursue solidarity.
[03:12:23.354 --> 03:12:28.535]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[03:12:29.773 --> 03:12:30.153]  They hate it.
[03:12:31.294 --> 03:12:36.536]  Come together for prosperity and treat people good, just be nice, and stop being a bunch of... There should be no fear.
[03:12:37.416 --> 03:12:38.416]  We are protected.
[03:12:39.017 --> 03:12:41.158]  And we will always be protected.
[03:12:41.178 --> 03:12:41.958]  That's the key, by God.
[03:12:41.978 --> 03:12:47.300]  We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:52.562]  And most importantly... God!
[03:12:52.602 --> 03:12:55.003]  We will be protected by God.
[03:12:55.383 --> 03:12:55.663]  Key.
[03:12:55.884 --> 03:12:56.664]  Brought God back in.
[03:12:57.464 --> 03:12:58.545]  Gotta ask God for the protection.
[03:12:58.565 --> 03:12:59.305]  He just did it.
[03:13:02.386 --> 03:13:06.688]  Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
[03:13:07.488 --> 03:13:14.312]  In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
[03:13:14.392 --> 03:13:14.812]  That's right.
[03:13:14.952 --> 03:13:15.432]  Innovation.
[03:13:15.492 --> 03:13:24.497]  We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
[03:13:24.517 --> 03:13:24.817]  That's right.
[03:13:24.837 --> 03:13:26.498]  You let a terror attack happen, you lose your job.
[03:13:27.898 --> 03:13:28.519]  You deliver.
[03:13:28.539 --> 03:13:29.939]  You don't get more power when you screw up.
[03:13:33.672 --> 03:13:36.513]  The time for empty talk is over.
[03:13:37.253 --> 03:13:40.374]  Now arrives the hour of action.
[03:13:41.194 --> 03:13:42.074]  The hour of action.
[03:13:42.114 --> 03:13:43.135]  Notice it's all Trump's done.
[03:13:44.195 --> 03:13:44.875]  We have the power.
[03:13:44.915 --> 03:13:45.775]  Humans can do anything.
[03:13:45.915 --> 03:13:50.777]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[03:13:50.797 --> 03:13:51.817]  It's been tens of thousands of years.
[03:13:51.837 --> 03:13:55.298]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[03:13:55.318 --> 03:13:56.458]  To build to this point, we have everything now.
[03:13:56.498 --> 03:13:57.318]  The secrets of the atom.
[03:13:57.338 --> 03:13:58.239]  We will not fail.
[03:13:58.299 --> 03:13:59.279]  Genes, everything.
[03:13:59.299 --> 03:14:01.920]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[03:14:01.940 --> 03:14:02.920]  God gave us this.
[03:14:04.002 --> 03:14:20.247]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[03:14:22.208 --> 03:14:31.074]  Back it up ten seconds, I'm going to come back, finish it, and go to Heavenly Ann and for the rest to get into the counter-strike against all this with the brainwashing of women and turning the species against itself.
[03:14:31.114 --> 03:14:32.875]  That's how you kill fire ants or anything else.
[03:14:32.895 --> 03:14:34.596]  You turn the species against itself.
[03:14:36.778 --> 03:14:38.559]  We're going to end the ravage of disease.
[03:14:38.579 --> 03:14:39.019]  We're going to do this.
[03:14:39.039 --> 03:14:39.580]  We have it.
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:40.400]  We've already done it.
[03:14:40.661 --> 03:14:41.721]  Folks, they already have it.
[03:14:41.801 --> 03:14:42.842]  It's admitted, okay?
[03:14:42.902 --> 03:14:44.023]  It's in major white papers.
[03:14:44.723 --> 03:14:48.005]  Not 100% cures, but in general, they've got it all.
[03:14:48.046 --> 03:14:49.947]  They're suppressing a ton of stuff.
[03:14:51.223 --> 03:14:52.023]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[03:14:52.043 --> 03:14:53.084]  I want people to hear this again.
[03:14:54.164 --> 03:14:56.005]  And Trump wants you to have that.
[03:14:56.025 --> 03:14:57.905]  He doesn't want to just go to Switzerland and get it for himself.
[03:14:57.925 --> 03:15:01.746]  Because he feels like crap getting that when you don't get it, like the Queen of England does.
[03:15:01.766 --> 03:15:03.967]  And he's like, OK, so what?
[03:15:04.067 --> 03:15:05.028]  There's too many people.
[03:15:05.048 --> 03:15:06.628]  We'll just figure it out and do something in space.
[03:15:07.428 --> 03:15:08.189]  We're not going to do this.
[03:15:09.209 --> 03:15:10.529]  So let's go out to break.
[03:15:10.549 --> 03:15:11.390]  Here's President Trump.
[03:15:11.430 --> 03:15:12.270]  He's now president!
[03:15:12.530 --> 03:15:13.610]  I told you he'd be president!
[03:15:13.630 --> 03:15:14.591]  We will not fail.
[03:15:15.271 --> 03:15:18.132]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[03:15:20.240 --> 03:15:36.571]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[03:15:37.432 --> 03:15:43.696]  A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[03:15:43.716 --> 03:15:44.016]  That's right.
[03:15:44.036 --> 03:15:44.256]  The U.S.
[03:15:44.296 --> 03:15:45.377]  has all the secret technologies.
[03:15:45.397 --> 03:15:46.378]  It's time to remember.
[03:15:47.479 --> 03:15:50.021]  We're going to deliver this to everybody.
[03:15:50.061 --> 03:15:57.907]  America will fulfill the promise.
[03:15:58.067 --> 03:15:59.788]  We'll be back with a conclusion.
[03:15:59.808 --> 03:16:00.709]  Stay with us.
[03:16:00.729 --> 03:16:01.330]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:16:01.630 --> 03:16:12.959]  I remember a little more than a decade ago hearing people talk about and write about probiotics and how we needed to supplement healthy bacteria in our gut.
[03:16:14.093 --> 03:16:15.494]  To displace the bad bacteria.
[03:16:15.534 --> 03:16:17.076]  At first I thought it was a load of baloney.
[03:16:17.957 --> 03:16:33.252]  But as I talked to established brain surgeons and scientists and experts on autism and so many other subjects, I began to learn that the globalists are actually very aware of the fact that the gut is the first line of the immune system and it's tied to the brain.
[03:16:34.454 --> 03:16:39.437]  So I began taking probiotics and they made my life a lot better and a lot healthier.
[03:16:40.058 --> 03:16:50.405]  We have developed with the top firms in the United States powerful 50 billion live organism probiotic floralife that is so critical
[03:16:51.772 --> 03:16:51.992]  Thank you.
[03:17:09.813 --> 03:17:17.117]  Floralife by itself at 50% off the amazing Advanced Restoration 50 billion live probiotics.
[03:17:17.757 --> 03:17:21.579]  We're offering sold out for six plus months because it's so hard to procure.
[03:17:22.019 --> 03:17:30.023]  MycoZX that targets the fungus, that targets the candida, that targets the mold.
[03:17:31.021 --> 03:17:32.161]  That takes over our guts.
[03:17:32.882 --> 03:17:37.483]  Because we know the good bacteria are being knocked out by the toxic food we eat.
[03:17:37.944 --> 03:17:41.305]  So it's good to replace those with a high quality source like floralife.
[03:17:41.945 --> 03:17:43.026]  But what about the fungus?
[03:17:43.066 --> 03:17:43.726]  What about the mold?
[03:17:43.746 --> 03:17:44.526]  What about the candida?
[03:17:44.826 --> 03:17:52.109]  It creates a literal slime wall in the intestines and it feeds on the nutrients before your body even gets it.
[03:17:52.489 --> 03:17:54.490]  Literally colonizing your body.
[03:17:54.930 --> 03:17:57.131]  Fungus has been known to colonize fruit flies.
[03:17:58.031 --> 03:17:59.691]  And other insects and other animals.
[03:17:59.772 --> 03:18:07.233]  It's been connected to killing massive numbers of bats and connected to all sorts of serious health problems and brain tumors.
[03:18:07.293 --> 03:18:08.634]  I mean, it's crazy.
[03:18:08.854 --> 03:18:14.795]  We've only just begun to understand a little bit about what fungus and other things are doing in our bodies.
[03:18:15.255 --> 03:18:25.598]  And we know our gut does not need to be filled with this garbage that has filled out the niches of our intestines because the good bacteria have been driven for our body.
[03:18:26.218 --> 03:18:32.206]  So it's not enough to just have the floralife or another high-quality probiotic to replace in your gut.
[03:18:32.226 --> 03:18:32.807]  That's critical.
[03:18:33.267 --> 03:18:42.399]  The other part is a compound like MycoZx that has all these key ingredients of organic herbs and other systems that are known to break down this garbage in the body.
[03:18:43.220 --> 03:18:57.210]  That's why, at the end of the month of December into early January, we're offering Floralife at 50% off and free shipping, almost a loss leader, and Mico's VX, 30% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:18:57.550 --> 03:18:59.691]  You can also get the two products together.
[03:19:00.672 --> 03:19:04.294]  And get them at 50% off when you combo them.
[03:19:04.694 --> 03:19:09.837]  So this is my gift to the listeners for your gift of supporting us and making the Information Warfare victory possible.

[03:19:24.304 --> 03:19:25.405]  So going into the new year,
[03:19:25.965 --> 03:19:32.186]  It's more critical than ever to think about having a healthy gut, the gateway of nutrients, and everything else in our body.
[03:19:32.627 --> 03:19:41.429]  And it all starts, not just with eating healthy, but with a high-quality probiotic like Floralife, and with a high-quality anti-fungal, anti-yeast system like MycoZx.
[03:19:41.749 --> 03:19:43.609]  So popular, sold out for more than six months.
[03:19:43.949 --> 03:19:49.550]  Now back in stock for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:14.375]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[03:20:15.997 --> 03:20:22.443]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[03:20:24.838 --> 03:20:25.759]  I'll see you again.
[03:20:25.779 --> 03:20:34.305]  So Trump is delivering on every front, getting more intense as he becomes president, not selling out the constituents.
[03:20:35.206 --> 03:20:38.868]  Again, there's so much wealth on the planet, it's in all the big globalist books, they admit it.
[03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:40.690]  They want to make people poor.
[03:20:40.810 --> 03:20:41.910]  It's their own admission.
[03:20:43.191 --> 03:20:45.312]  Their argument is being wealthy hurts the earth.
[03:20:45.372 --> 03:20:49.153]  No, we just create clean versions of it, which they're suppressing.
[03:20:49.613 --> 03:20:54.055]  Liane Mackin is about to jump with the balance of the hour looking at their counter strike against all this.
[03:20:54.075 --> 03:20:54.835]  I was there.
[03:20:55.255 --> 03:21:01.617]  But first, let's finish up with President Trump's speech where he's breaking down, unlocking the secrets of the universe, which I can tell you.
[03:21:02.918 --> 03:21:09.359]  My father at UT, in high school, in the Plan 2 program, in the mid-60s they had CD-ROMs and computers.
[03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:10.920]  We didn't see until the 80s.
[03:21:11.480 --> 03:21:13.760]  They have suppressed technology 30 years behind.
[03:21:14.181 --> 03:21:14.961]  Trump knows it.
[03:21:15.441 --> 03:21:16.921]  He wants it rolled out to the public.
[03:21:16.961 --> 03:21:18.101]  This is the biggest issue.
[03:21:18.782 --> 03:21:21.542]  You want disclosure about all the secret technologies, the rest of it?
[03:21:21.882 --> 03:21:23.903]  They admit they're suppressing AI, you name it.
[03:21:24.183 --> 03:21:25.903]  You want a pro-human world and future?
[03:21:26.843 --> 03:21:27.483]  Donald Trump!
[03:21:27.864 --> 03:21:28.464]  Let me explain something.
[03:21:28.484 --> 03:21:29.384]  People ask, is Trump real?
[03:21:30.333 --> 03:21:32.195]  Saying this destroys the enemy.
[03:21:32.975 --> 03:21:37.219]  The entire globalist program is against Trump right now and is in death throes.
[03:21:37.619 --> 03:21:39.080]  They're panicking everywhere.
[03:21:39.741 --> 03:21:41.502]  He got a standing ovation at the CIA.
[03:21:41.882 --> 03:21:43.424]  CNN said the CIA hated him.
[03:21:44.184 --> 03:21:48.348]  They said nobody showed up and showed a shot of the morning early before the gates opened.
[03:21:48.868 --> 03:21:51.510]  They said he took Martin Luther King's bust out and threw it in the street.
[03:21:51.770 --> 03:21:52.531]  It was right there!
[03:21:53.612 --> 03:21:54.853]  They are freaking out.
[03:21:54.873 --> 03:21:57.055]  I'll talk to Leanne in a moment, but here's the conclusion.
[03:21:57.981 --> 03:21:59.323]  That it cannot be done.
[03:22:00.004 --> 03:22:05.012]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[03:22:05.613 --> 03:22:06.855]  We will not fail.
[03:22:07.577 --> 03:22:10.421]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[03:22:12.512 --> 03:22:28.783]  We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.
[03:22:29.623 --> 03:22:36.489]  A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
[03:22:37.270 --> 03:22:41.894]  It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget.
[03:22:41.914 --> 03:22:51.642]  That whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[03:22:58.183 --> 03:23:06.068]  We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
[03:23:11.405 --> 03:23:31.912]  And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
[03:23:33.624 --> 03:23:36.407]  You know, Billy Corrigan was smashing pumpkins a couple years ago.
[03:23:36.447 --> 03:23:40.010]  He said, Alex, the key of what you do is you talk about looking up at the night sky, coming together as humans.
[03:23:54.798 --> 03:23:56.839]  Again, you say, oh, that's just hype.
[03:23:56.899 --> 03:23:58.820]  No, he's saying you little people have the power.
[03:23:59.261 --> 03:24:00.061]  You're powerful.
[03:24:00.181 --> 03:24:01.242]  Demand action.
[03:24:01.702 --> 03:24:02.582]  Demand the truth.
[03:24:02.643 --> 03:24:06.585]  It's like Bannon said, keep us honest, stay on us, help us, spur us.
[03:24:07.385 --> 03:24:08.826]  And he's saying you have the power.
[03:24:08.886 --> 03:24:10.667]  Everything else is about, oh, you need us to be powerful.
[03:24:10.707 --> 03:24:12.208]  No, no, you come first.
[03:24:12.348 --> 03:24:14.529]  You are what dictates the destiny.
[03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:15.850]  All of us together.
[03:24:16.310 --> 03:24:17.271]  Let's finish the speech.
[03:24:21.696 --> 03:24:29.161]  Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny.
[03:24:30.062 --> 03:24:35.005]  And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[03:24:35.285 --> 03:24:36.686]  Pause again.
[03:24:37.267 --> 03:24:38.147]  Back in five seconds.
[03:24:38.768 --> 03:24:40.869]  What did I say in that promo video we've been running for two weeks?
[03:24:40.929 --> 03:24:48.575]  I said, this is American destiny and we must take it, but we have to be good, we have to be loving, we have to come together racially, culturally, we have to do this.
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:51.761]  We are the power and notice Trump saying it.
[03:24:51.961 --> 03:24:52.761]  He didn't get it from me.
[03:24:52.881 --> 03:24:53.601]  It's the truth.
[03:24:54.201 --> 03:24:57.962]  This is the true spirit of humanity that America was the greatest example of.
[03:24:58.742 --> 03:25:02.723]  And that's why the enemies and controllers are now making a joke out of themselves.
[03:25:02.763 --> 03:25:03.323]  Let's finish.
[03:25:05.884 --> 03:25:10.785]  And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
[03:25:12.096 --> 03:25:15.859]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[03:25:16.559 --> 03:25:19.301]  We will make America wealthy again.
[03:25:19.722 --> 03:25:22.464]  We will make America proud again.
[03:25:22.904 --> 03:25:25.506]  We will make America safe again.
[03:25:25.966 --> 03:25:31.610]  And yes, together, we will make America great again.
[03:25:31.630 --> 03:25:36.014]  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.
[03:25:38.306 --> 03:25:43.172]  And you understand the entire Globalist program is about making individuals disempowered, dependent.
[03:25:43.513 --> 03:25:45.094]  He's saying, no, you're the power.
[03:25:45.435 --> 03:25:46.436]  We're going to empower you.
[03:25:46.456 --> 03:25:47.497]  You're going to empower us.
[03:25:48.809 --> 03:25:53.174]  There's no way he's not real, because this message is like sunlight to vampires.
[03:25:53.554 --> 03:25:55.977]  This is the antithesis of the New World Order.
[03:25:55.997 --> 03:25:58.159]  Leanne, we're going to cover all this coming back.
[03:25:58.199 --> 03:26:02.504]  Your view as a woman of the supposed Million Woman March, which got damn close to it.
[03:26:02.544 --> 03:26:03.565]  I was there yesterday.
[03:26:03.585 --> 03:26:07.789]  And what they were saying and doing, I mean, they were so evil and horrible, it was like cartoonish.
[03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:12.274]  What was happening, but I want to show how the CIA runs it and Soros and the Muslims.
[03:26:12.754 --> 03:26:15.157]  A Muslim group literally was running it?
[03:26:15.497 --> 03:26:16.738]  That would put you in a dungeon?
[03:26:16.818 --> 03:26:19.121]  I mean... A Sharia law advocate?
[03:26:19.982 --> 03:26:20.722]  One of the top ones.
[03:26:20.883 --> 03:26:22.664]  But overall, I don't know your view.
[03:26:22.684 --> 03:26:25.087]  I haven't talked to you until you got here 10 minutes ago at the studio.
[03:26:25.567 --> 03:26:27.029]  But I mean, what is your view of what you saw?
[03:26:28.004 --> 03:26:33.149]  Well, you know, for me, I think obviously protesting is kind of a cornerstone of our republic.
[03:26:33.209 --> 03:26:35.591]  So I'm like, fine, go out there, do what you need to do.
[03:26:35.711 --> 03:26:39.314]  I feel truly like we are living in a dual reality with these people.
[03:26:39.775 --> 03:26:43.858]  Truly, the dimensions have split and we are superimposed on top of them because
[03:26:44.739 --> 03:26:48.281]  We could listen to Donald Trump's speech and say, wow, incredible.
[03:26:50.041 --> 03:26:51.382]  All about unity.
[03:26:51.862 --> 03:26:53.023]  We the people have the power back.
[03:26:53.303 --> 03:26:55.584]  He's even getting white supremacists to stop being racist.
[03:26:55.604 --> 03:26:59.506]  I mean, this is real.
[03:27:00.166 --> 03:27:08.129]  Let's walk back a few months when he had the standing ovation at the RNC when he brought up gay people and said, look, it's time for the RNC.
[03:27:08.169 --> 03:27:09.970]  Let's all love each other, Republicans rule!
[03:27:12.051 --> 03:27:13.453]  Hillary wouldn't even mention it.
[03:27:27.139 --> 03:27:32.100]  And I think I'm going to have to switch to the YMCA because they have banned CNN from being played at their gym.
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:41.743]  But CNN was on and they had the picture up, the side-by-side, the fake news photo with a, you know, 8.30 in the morning when they took the photo of the crowd and said, look, here's the inauguration.
[03:27:41.883 --> 03:27:42.103]  Oh, I know.
[03:27:42.123 --> 03:27:43.624]  They're celebrating that no one showed up.
[03:27:43.904 --> 03:27:45.644]  They were beating people up so they couldn't get in.
[03:27:46.024 --> 03:27:47.065]  It's total fake news.
[03:27:47.085 --> 03:27:48.365]  I was personally punched repeatedly.
[03:27:48.685 --> 03:27:49.165]  Yeah.
[03:27:49.245 --> 03:27:51.306]  And even CNN, they have a... I couldn't get in.
[03:27:51.866 --> 03:27:52.186]  Nine?
[03:27:52.226 --> 03:27:54.068]  I had to go like four miles around.
[03:27:54.088 --> 03:27:56.209]  I got attacked there, couldn't get in.
[03:27:56.269 --> 03:27:57.330]  Everybody was on video, live.
[03:27:57.350 --> 03:28:01.613]  I had to go like, so I barely got in, didn't even get my seats like right up at the front.
[03:28:01.894 --> 03:28:10.881]  Right, well they would have 40 people across, six rows deep, blocking people off with like a human chain saying, this entry is blocked, this entry is blocked.
[03:28:10.901 --> 03:28:13.342]  And the weird thing is it was Black Lives Matter, they were almost all white.
[03:28:13.623 --> 03:28:16.325]  They'd punch me and say, you're a white male, F you.
[03:28:16.345 --> 03:28:16.665]  Right.
[03:28:16.685 --> 03:28:17.866]  And it was so racist.
[03:28:18.186 --> 03:28:25.268]  Right, well, and then also too, I was seeing tons of signs at the Women's March, you know, posted all over social media about how white women voted for Trump.
[03:28:25.328 --> 03:28:26.928]  Don't forget, it's white women's fault.
[03:28:27.508 --> 03:28:32.809]  You know, and then you have these conservative, pro-life women who wanted to be a part of the march and they were excluded from it.
[03:28:32.829 --> 03:28:35.210]  This isn't about women and equality and Women's March.
[03:28:35.250 --> 03:28:42.992]  This is a total... Well, I want to get your view on this because, I mean, I gotta say, they were so comically evil, hateful, and the men were the most beta,
[03:28:44.072 --> 03:28:50.758]  Like zombies, like reanimated corpses, like 85 pounds, stumbling around huge black circles, drooling.
[03:28:51.058 --> 03:28:51.758]  No, I'm serious.
[03:28:51.798 --> 03:28:52.799]  Something sucked your soul.
[03:29:02.227 --> 03:29:03.628]  Welcome to the War Room.

[03:29:36.209 --> 03:29:39.950]  For far too long, the liberal media complex has controlled the narrative.
[03:29:40.411 --> 03:29:43.152]  For far too long, the silent majority has been muzzled.
[03:29:43.652 --> 03:29:48.073]  The silent majority is no longer silent, and we control the narrative now.
[03:29:49.454 --> 03:29:53.215]  This is the War Room.
[03:29:56.236 --> 03:30:00.138]  If you are receiving this translation, you are the resistance.
[03:30:07.045 --> 03:30:14.171]  Tommy Robinson, the activist and citizen over in the UK, has launched the Tommy Robinson Show.
[03:30:14.211 --> 03:30:19.876]  He's also got the newest book, Enemy of the State, and also Muhammad's Quran, actually quoting what's in it.
[03:30:19.896 --> 03:30:29.464]  But there's no doubt that 10 million in Europe, millions here, just in the last couple of years, have brought in anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-woman, anti-gay,
[03:30:30.325 --> 03:30:35.066]  Crazed people that kill each other in their own countries and know they're attacking and are covering it up.
[03:30:35.426 --> 03:30:36.827]  What, till they build critical mass?
[03:30:36.867 --> 03:30:38.267]  I mean, they've blown up the drawbridge.
[03:30:38.527 --> 03:30:39.568]  They stormed the castle.
[03:30:39.848 --> 03:30:42.268]  They want reinforcements in before they declare what's happened.
[03:30:42.288 --> 03:30:49.410]  I mean, why are they clamping down and even saying in Congress, Alex Jones cannot tell people that a Muslim killed folks in New York?
[03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:50.290]  They actually say that.
[03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:51.591]  They say, this is fake news.
[03:30:51.651 --> 03:30:52.411]  It must be banned.
[03:30:52.631 --> 03:31:00.653]  Alex, you know what's amazing for me was I've recently traveled to East Germany and I've just come back from Poland three or four days ago, yeah?
[03:31:01.313 --> 03:31:16.776]  The difference in Poland, when you see a country where you never thought people would be grateful for communism at a time, but because they had communism and because it didn't change till 1990 and because of the Iron Curtain... They recognize authoritarianism.
[03:31:17.927 --> 03:31:18.987]  Yeah, they recognise it.
[03:31:19.388 --> 03:31:22.009]  They didn't have an influx of immigration.
[03:31:22.589 --> 03:31:29.772]  So they're still, because they're the only culture and the only race in their country, they're allowed to be proud of who they are.
[03:31:30.392 --> 03:31:31.573]  In our country, we can't.
[03:31:32.073 --> 03:31:38.535]  I've just come back and I've come back and I've seen the most unbelievable scenes of patriotism that I've never seen.
[03:31:38.816 --> 03:31:42.197]  I've never experienced anything like I experienced this weekend in Poland.
[03:31:42.817 --> 03:31:48.880]  I saw hundreds of thousands of Polish who were defiant, who were so energetic.
[03:31:49.180 --> 03:31:49.680]  They know.
[03:31:49.840 --> 03:31:51.121]  They know what it's like to fight.
[03:31:51.481 --> 03:31:52.661]  It's what they said to us.
[03:31:53.222 --> 03:31:54.342]  You haven't been challenged.
[03:31:54.742 --> 03:31:55.783]  You have not been challenged.
[03:31:56.043 --> 03:31:59.464]  The biggest civil uprising in history was in Warsaw, I believe, in 1944.
[03:31:59.504 --> 03:32:00.585]  That was the Jews, yeah.
[03:32:02.086 --> 03:32:06.128]  They all have relatives after relatives who have told them these stories.
[03:32:06.168 --> 03:32:07.849]  They understand the need to fight.
[03:32:08.069 --> 03:32:09.770]  They understand the battle against communism.
[03:32:10.010 --> 03:32:11.811]  They understand what communism done to their country.
[03:32:12.051 --> 03:32:13.251]  They understand what Islam will do.
[03:32:13.451 --> 03:32:19.054]  When I went to East Germany and I spoke to elder people there, they said, we've seen this before.
[03:32:19.654 --> 03:32:20.735]  You can't talk about it.
[03:32:21.599 --> 03:32:22.481]  You'll lose your job.
[03:32:23.082 --> 03:32:24.003]  Is this communism?
[03:32:24.304 --> 03:32:25.346]  We've had communism.
[03:32:25.626 --> 03:32:27.009]  We've got away from that.
[03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:28.531]  Now we have the same with Islam.
[03:32:28.772 --> 03:32:29.774]  You can't talk about Islam.
[03:32:29.794 --> 03:32:30.815]  You can't talk about the refugees.
[03:32:30.856 --> 03:32:31.537]  You'll lose your job.
[03:32:31.557 --> 03:32:32.118]  You'll lose your work.
[03:32:32.970 --> 03:32:46.223]  So, yeah, it's been, to see the difference in the different countries, and to know that Eastern Europe, to know that Hungary, to know that Poland, to know that Czech Republic, I think are going to become countries that we all look to for inspiration.
[03:32:46.303 --> 03:32:47.324]  Exactly.
[03:32:47.404 --> 03:32:48.685]  All because they won't be conquered.
[03:32:49.045 --> 03:32:50.066]  We'll be right back.
[03:32:50.106 --> 03:32:53.369]  Remember, it's the megabanks, the ultra-rich using the Muslims.
[03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:54.951]  They are being used.
[03:32:54.991 --> 03:32:55.712]  They're victims too.
[03:33:06.355 --> 03:33:07.796]  We are on the march.
[03:33:08.416 --> 03:33:10.677]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:33:11.298 --> 03:33:15.079]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:15.099 --> 03:33:15.960]  I'm waiting.
[03:33:16.600 --> 03:33:20.782]  Reflecting on my past life.
[03:33:30.026 --> 03:33:34.308]  I mean, here I am, and let's be honest, we, this show, have changed the world.
[03:33:34.328 --> 03:33:37.490]  And I'm more humble than I was 20 years ago.
[03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:42.332]  And at 5 o'clock, they take me to the gallows pole.
[03:33:42.352 --> 03:33:45.334]  I mean, they're openly saying they want to kill me.
[03:33:45.414 --> 03:33:46.574]  They're saying, shut us down.
[03:33:46.594 --> 03:33:53.618]  I still have love for these throngs of people that, they were defeating me not in the way they thought.
[03:33:54.488 --> 03:34:01.233]  There's thousands of women, every few minutes went by me, screaming, F you, hope you die, fascist, Nazi.
[03:34:01.253 --> 03:34:04.695]  And I'd try to talk to them, it was all on Facebook Mentions, millions watching.
[03:34:05.256 --> 03:34:15.603]  They wouldn't talk, they just screamed, I was the enemy, and then go, Trump not hate, or hate not Trump, and all this crazy froth, and I was just like trying to talk, and they wouldn't humanize me.
[03:34:15.663 --> 03:34:16.284]  They wouldn't
[03:34:18.098 --> 03:34:18.558]  I don't know.
[03:34:39.403 --> 03:34:43.524]  Going into high gear, what haven't they learned from their defeats, Leigh-Anne?
[03:34:44.024 --> 03:34:49.945]  Well, it's just surreal watching the media, the mainstream media, is absolutely still trying to delegitimize Trump.
[03:34:50.326 --> 03:34:58.207]  And every single move, once he called them out on that fake photo they were using to pick on his crowd size, that became their whole thing.
[03:34:58.267 --> 03:34:59.128]  And so they're still using it.
[03:34:59.148 --> 03:35:01.728]  They're like, why are you complaining we said no one showed up?
[03:35:01.868 --> 03:35:02.108]  Yes.
[03:35:02.388 --> 03:35:04.269]  They're like, oh, he got rid of Martin Luther King!
[03:35:04.949 --> 03:35:07.411]  They're like, no I didn't hear it as well, just shut up and quit bitching!
[03:35:07.551 --> 03:35:08.212]  Yeah, how dare you?
[03:35:08.252 --> 03:35:09.593]  They hate the fact he calls them.
[03:35:09.753 --> 03:35:11.135]  They go, he's obsessed with himself.
[03:35:11.155 --> 03:35:11.815]  Yeah, the truth.
[03:35:12.115 --> 03:35:13.477]  Every time you lie, he counters you.
[03:35:13.657 --> 03:35:14.097]  Exactly.
[03:35:14.117 --> 03:35:15.679]  He's got more energy than all of you.
[03:35:15.719 --> 03:35:16.659]  They can't stand it.
[03:35:16.860 --> 03:35:17.840]  Let me say, I'm 43.
[03:35:17.921 --> 03:35:19.062]  I got more energy than anybody.
[03:35:19.622 --> 03:35:20.523]  Trump's Trump's me.
[03:35:21.504 --> 03:35:23.545]  It's not a Trump ass-kissing contest, Leigh-Anne.
[03:35:24.106 --> 03:35:25.067]  It's starting to get spooky.
[03:35:25.327 --> 03:35:40.058]  No, I mean, here's the thing is, when I was at the gym and CNN was on and I just saw the picture up there, I didn't even stop to watch it, I just got so angry because I was, in my mind I'm thinking, people only get, there are people out there that... Yeah, in fact, I meant to give this to the crew.
[03:35:40.159 --> 03:35:41.460]  If we don't do it today, we'll show it tomorrow.
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:45.302]  They showed like 8.30 the shot with no one there and said, look, no one showed up.
[03:35:45.623 --> 03:35:47.945]  Meanwhile, it was a record crowd of like 1.8 million.
[03:35:48.405 --> 03:35:52.548]  I mean, it's just like, God, I guess we thought they'd be discredited, they go away.
[03:35:52.648 --> 03:35:53.429]  No, they're now like...
[03:35:53.849 --> 03:35:54.669]  We're discredited!
[03:35:54.709 --> 03:35:56.150]  Let's just say the moon's made of cheese!
[03:35:56.330 --> 03:36:03.092]  Well, and just to prove that they used a photo from earlier in the morning... Hey guys, just Google, uh, left runs with fake photo.
[03:36:03.112 --> 03:36:03.432]  There it is.
[03:36:03.452 --> 03:36:03.832]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:36:03.852 --> 03:36:04.512]  That's what they did.
[03:36:04.752 --> 03:36:05.513]  You have the meme.
[03:36:06.153 --> 03:36:09.314]  So, I saw this photo that was out
[03:36:09.614 --> 03:36:10.115]  We're good.
[03:36:28.374 --> 03:36:39.025]  When their own gigapixel photo that they have shows a huge crowd, but yet they're still going to roll out that picture today and say, Donald Trump says we're lying, but here's the photo proof.
[03:36:39.385 --> 03:36:46.973]  And that's what makes me so angry is that there are people out there that only get their news from CNN and they truly believe this alternate reality.
[03:36:47.133 --> 03:36:56.820]  I was telling these women, they're like, oh, Trump did bring jobs back, and I'm like, Chrysler, Ford, Carrier, Foxcom, they were just like, liar!
[03:36:57.280 --> 03:36:59.402]  And then they go, F you white male!
[03:36:59.422 --> 03:37:02.044]  It was all white women, and I was like, that's so racist!
[03:37:02.284 --> 03:37:03.645]  Well, then you get back to the real world.
[03:37:03.685 --> 03:37:14.149]  There's actually a video up on the Drudge Report about this woman who was on the plane and she's, you know, flying out of D.C., talks to the person next to her to come here to protest or to celebrate.
[03:37:14.189 --> 03:37:15.490]  And he's, you know, just polite.
[03:37:16.090 --> 03:37:18.091]  So once she finds out he was there to support
[03:37:19.031 --> 03:37:24.614]  Celebrate Democracy, she starts going after him saying, well I'm entitled to get drunk and puke on your lap.
[03:37:24.674 --> 03:37:28.716]  I'm gonna, you make me sick, don't talk to me, don't look at me, don't even use the armrest.
[03:37:28.897 --> 03:37:33.739]  Move, I'm gonna make, you know, just totally being, you disgust me, you're a bigot, get off this plane.
[03:37:33.779 --> 03:37:40.783]  And he's like, well ma'am, the very definition of bigotry is disparaging someone prior to knowing them, simply by their beliefs and opinions.
[03:37:41.183 --> 03:37:43.465]  And she's like, ugh, no, you gotta, trying to force him off.
[03:37:44.165 --> 03:37:50.830]  And the stewardess shuts her down and says, ma'am, you don't have the right to kick this guy off the plane or to force him to move seats.
[03:37:50.890 --> 03:37:53.411]  And then she ended up kicking this old lady off the plane.
[03:37:53.432 --> 03:37:55.513]  I gotta be honest with you.
[03:37:55.533 --> 03:37:56.594]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:37:56.814 --> 03:37:57.434]  I was there.
[03:37:57.474 --> 03:37:58.895]  I don't know if you saw the live feeds.
[03:37:59.015 --> 03:37:59.756]  Yeah, they would.
[03:37:59.876 --> 03:38:03.679]  I mean, they were just like, we run this world now.
[03:38:03.739 --> 03:38:04.719]  You get off the plane.
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:06.621]  It was like I didn't exist.
[03:38:07.301 --> 03:38:09.002]  Yeah, well, see, and that's the thing.
[03:38:09.022 --> 03:38:11.044]  You know, I'm glad that you brought that up because I feel like
[03:38:12.048 --> 03:38:16.512]  We could all be really tempted to attack them in the same way that they are treating us.
[03:38:16.532 --> 03:38:17.393]  No, they're victims.
[03:38:17.573 --> 03:38:19.334]  They're not people to get in a cult.
[03:38:19.354 --> 03:38:21.096]  They're like getting somebody out of a major cult.
[03:38:21.216 --> 03:38:21.676]  Exactly.
[03:38:21.756 --> 03:38:26.560]  I feel like Pence did a great job in the debate when you saw how that was...
[03:38:27.401 --> 03:38:27.761]  I don't know.
[03:38:47.244 --> 03:38:51.587]  But what do you think happens as we start restoring prosperity, bringing people together?
[03:38:51.627 --> 03:38:52.548]  What do they do next?
[03:38:52.568 --> 03:38:53.929]  Because they are just hysterical.
[03:38:53.969 --> 03:38:55.710]  How do you resist prosperity?
[03:38:55.770 --> 03:38:56.931]  How do you resist freedom?
[03:38:57.211 --> 03:39:01.034]  That's why I feel like, I hope Donald Trump just kind of... That's a good bumper sticker!
[03:39:01.094 --> 03:39:01.995]  How do you resist freedom?
[03:39:02.595 --> 03:39:03.115]  I don't want to.
[03:39:03.496 --> 03:39:04.056]  Exactly!
[03:39:04.096 --> 03:39:04.536]  That's the thing.
[03:39:04.576 --> 03:39:07.757]  I really hope Trump... How do you resist your birthright?
[03:39:07.858 --> 03:39:11.579]  How do you resist something so obviously... Because my gut's never wrong.
[03:39:11.599 --> 03:39:12.119]  Right.
[03:39:12.159 --> 03:39:14.260]  And I didn't like Trump before because I thought I liked TV.
[03:39:14.300 --> 03:39:15.161]  And I was like, ugh, Trump.
[03:39:15.181 --> 03:39:16.581]  But my gut says Trump, Trump, Trump.
[03:39:16.601 --> 03:39:16.802]  Exactly.
[03:39:16.822 --> 03:39:17.962]  Everybody's like, why are you liking Trump?
[03:39:17.982 --> 03:39:18.943]  I go, my gut says it.
[03:39:19.483 --> 03:39:21.404]  And thank God in the last two years I started to follow my gut.
[03:39:22.796 --> 03:39:23.796]  God, they want to kill him, though.
[03:39:23.956 --> 03:39:26.838]  I just, and I hate, I've never admired somebody like this.
[03:39:26.958 --> 03:39:31.440]  It's like, I actually feel embarrassed how much I admire him, but he just keeps doing everything right.
[03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:32.260]  I'm curious.
[03:39:32.380 --> 03:39:34.521]  That was such an inclusive, loving speech.
[03:39:34.721 --> 03:39:46.726]  And we were all wondering, just waiting for them, for the mainstream to get back to their little computers and type up their story, like wondering how are they going to tear his speech apart and make it bad, and he's an- They said it was ominous and scary.
[03:39:46.746 --> 03:39:47.406]  It was the opposite.
[03:39:47.506 --> 03:39:52.298]  Yeah, someone said it's reminding me of the night... We're going to unlock the diseases and cure people.
[03:39:52.398 --> 03:39:53.360]  Oh, it's so scary.
[03:39:53.401 --> 03:39:56.027]  Yeah, he's reminding me of an anti-Semitic speech.
[03:39:57.301 --> 03:40:00.863]  You know, what speech were you listening to?
[03:40:00.883 --> 03:40:02.063]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:40:02.083 --> 03:40:07.206]  Oh, I love he's anti-Semitic when he wants to move the Israeli U.S.
[03:40:07.226 --> 03:40:08.987]  consulate from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[03:40:09.167 --> 03:40:14.630]  I mean, it's just all made up crap because they know the average liberal doesn't know that Jews were dancing in the streets.
[03:40:14.810 --> 03:40:17.611]  Yeah, when Obama was like the most hostile president to Israel.
[03:40:17.691 --> 03:40:19.072]  I know, it's all upside down.
[03:40:19.372 --> 03:40:21.354]  It's, it's, that's, it's crazy.
[03:40:21.454 --> 03:40:23.916]  Like, we are typically the ones checking the government.
[03:40:23.976 --> 03:40:27.839]  We would typically be there going, oh, Trump making fun of his every move and like checking him and calling.
[03:40:28.099 --> 03:40:28.999]  But it's Wally Woe!
[03:40:29.019 --> 03:40:32.222]  Spicer comes out and gives a press conference and it's like all true.
[03:40:32.242 --> 03:40:35.585]  And he was like all moral authority and hitting him and being honest.
[03:40:35.665 --> 03:40:37.046]  I was like, what is going on?
[03:40:37.786 --> 03:40:38.006]  It is.
[03:40:38.226 --> 03:40:40.287]  We are living in, Lala, it's crazy.
[03:40:40.587 --> 03:40:42.628]  I'm curious how you felt, though, just being out there.
[03:40:42.648 --> 03:40:44.809]  I know you kept kind of breaking down.
[03:40:45.109 --> 03:40:45.969]  We saw you on Life.
[03:40:46.009 --> 03:40:47.670]  I just felt really bad.
[03:40:47.690 --> 03:40:48.850]  20 years, but this is 20 years in your life.
[03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:51.791]  When they would march by and say, F you, F you, you're a racist.
[03:40:52.152 --> 03:40:52.432]  Yeah.
[03:40:52.492 --> 03:40:53.832]  And you hate women when I don't.
[03:40:53.852 --> 03:40:54.653]  Just flipping me off.
[03:40:54.673 --> 03:40:55.873]  It was like a cult.
[03:40:56.533 --> 03:40:59.915]  It was like, it was hundreds and hundreds of women an hour going, F you.
[03:40:59.935 --> 03:41:01.055]  I mean, we ran into fans, too.
[03:41:01.095 --> 03:41:03.096]  Every other Trump supporter was an Infowarrior.
[03:41:03.156 --> 03:41:05.337]  But I would try to say, no, no.
[03:41:06.397 --> 03:41:09.839]  Edward Bernays, the CIA, it's to hurt the... I would just go, F you.
[03:41:09.999 --> 03:41:14.682]  Oh, well, and then one of the big things they were doing was putting on hijabs to show their slavery.
[03:41:14.722 --> 03:41:15.303]  Oh, I saw that!
[03:41:15.343 --> 03:41:20.066]  It's like, how dare you, you bigot, be against Islam when it totally enslaves women?
[03:41:20.086 --> 03:41:21.767]  And I wasn't even bringing up Islam at first.
[03:41:21.827 --> 03:41:22.868]  It's a symbol of oppression.
[03:41:22.928 --> 03:41:26.150]  It's a symbol of that, you know, when you want to practice Sharia law or whatever.
[03:41:26.170 --> 03:41:28.231]  Leigh-Anne, if you want to come to work, we're gonna put a bag over your head.
[03:41:28.291 --> 03:41:29.812]  Yeah, it's like, you have to be submissive.
[03:41:29.832 --> 03:41:30.853]  Can you imagine if I would've said those words?
[03:41:30.873 --> 03:41:32.474]  I should do that, like, I have a bag then.
[03:41:32.534 --> 03:41:33.274]  We put this over your head.
[03:41:33.294 --> 03:41:34.495]  No, no, it'd be like, oh, you're trying to rape me.
[03:41:34.855 --> 03:41:35.776]  Yeah.
[03:41:37.357 --> 03:41:38.237]  They're in a cult, man.
[03:41:38.478 --> 03:41:42.681]  I noticed like Muslims, I said this yesterday on the video live, we're like running it.
[03:41:42.761 --> 03:41:46.043]  It's in the news now that it's Women's March organizers.
[03:41:46.063 --> 03:41:47.064]  Yeah, one of the leaders.
[03:41:47.164 --> 03:41:49.926]  It's one of the top Sharia law.
[03:41:50.486 --> 03:41:52.668]  Cut women's genitals off, put hoods on their heads.
[03:41:52.948 --> 03:41:54.389]  Yeah, yeah, we got video of that.
[03:41:54.609 --> 03:41:56.331]  There was women, hundreds of them, holding those signs.
[03:41:56.691 --> 03:41:58.272]  We the people, Sharia law.
[03:41:58.653 --> 03:42:04.758]  So now, being a slave as a woman against me, who just spoils women, now I'm bad.
[03:42:04.778 --> 03:42:06.699]  I don't want to put a hood on their head.
[03:42:07.100 --> 03:42:09.842]  The girl, I believe her name, the woman, Linda Sarsour, I believe.
[03:42:09.882 --> 03:42:10.803]  I've got the article right here.
[03:42:10.843 --> 03:42:14.606]  She was on Rachel Maddow before this March, talking about it, saying...
[03:42:15.660 --> 03:42:19.361]  You know, 22 states in this country don't allow Sharia law.
[03:42:19.481 --> 03:42:21.141]  They don't allow us to practice our religion.
[03:42:21.161 --> 03:42:27.082]  It's like, no, sure, you can practice Islam, but Sharia law is a separate... You're not going to take a newborn girl and cut her genitals off.
[03:42:27.102 --> 03:42:28.442]  It's a separate tenet of the religion.
[03:42:28.462 --> 03:42:29.362]  It's kind of an aside.
[03:42:29.422 --> 03:42:31.983]  So it's like, here's... Oh yeah, yeah, they're using our freedom to ban it.
[03:42:32.003 --> 03:42:34.083]  And here's our constitution, you know, version of it.
[03:42:34.103 --> 03:42:40.924]  And it's like, no... No, it's liberal women saying the West that empowers women has enslaved them in my face, hating me.
[03:42:41.284 --> 03:42:44.165]  The thing that's wrong is it's not 50 states that don't allow Sharia law.
[03:42:44.726 --> 03:42:45.868]  22.
[03:42:44.746 --> 03:42:45.868]  Well, you know what it is?
[03:42:45.909 --> 03:42:47.593]  It's classic Stockholm thing.
[03:42:47.673 --> 03:42:49.938]  So spoiled, they want to be slaves.
[03:43:01.880 --> 03:43:10.562]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:43:10.622 --> 03:43:11.082]  That's right.
[03:43:11.162 --> 03:43:16.162]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[03:43:16.423 --> 03:43:22.904]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[03:43:23.104 --> 03:43:30.345]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:43:30.725 --> 03:43:30.865]  Woo!
[03:43:30.925 --> 03:43:31.846]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:43:31.966 --> 03:43:40.552]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:43:40.692 --> 03:43:49.919]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:43:50.299 --> 03:43:53.621]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:43:53.741 --> 03:43:57.704]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:43:57.864 --> 03:43:58.705]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:43:58.905 --> 03:44:01.526]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:02.046 --> 03:44:03.907]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:44:03.947 --> 03:44:04.307]  Go ahead.
[03:44:05.208 --> 03:44:07.088]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:44:07.128 --> 03:44:17.452]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:44:17.633 --> 03:44:20.974]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:44:21.474 --> 03:44:21.734]  Absolutely.
[03:44:43.917 --> 03:44:57.184]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:45:11.031 --> 03:45:11.691]  Just briefly,
[03:45:12.910 --> 03:45:14.931]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:45:14.951 --> 03:45:15.812]  He's about to retire.
[03:45:15.832 --> 03:45:22.776]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[03:45:22.856 --> 03:45:25.917]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[03:45:25.957 --> 03:45:26.938]  That's a bunch of bull.
[03:45:27.458 --> 03:45:28.499]  You need fluoride or you die.
[03:45:29.079 --> 03:45:31.560]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply in the Florida.
[03:45:31.580 --> 03:45:32.361]  He said, this is incredible.
[03:45:32.781 --> 03:45:34.762]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[03:45:34.802 --> 03:45:40.705]  They're covering for it, calling it Florida under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[03:45:41.305 --> 03:45:41.785]  Exactly.
[03:45:41.825 --> 03:45:47.828]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[03:45:47.868 --> 03:45:51.650]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[03:45:53.031 --> 03:45:54.372]  You don't drink your sunscreen.
[03:45:54.472 --> 03:45:56.553]  But hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[03:45:57.537 --> 03:45:58.237]  I don't know.
[03:46:14.352 --> 03:46:17.893]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[03:46:18.334 --> 03:46:19.554]  Why does it say nursery water?
[03:46:19.574 --> 03:46:20.795]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[03:46:20.855 --> 03:46:23.756]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[03:46:23.796 --> 03:46:25.757]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:46:25.977 --> 03:46:37.522]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Tom's of Maine, private labeled, super blue, non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[03:46:37.542 --> 03:46:39.102]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[03:46:39.502 --> 03:46:40.883]  You drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[03:46:40.963 --> 03:46:41.843]  It's a different type of iodine.
[03:46:41.863 --> 03:46:43.264]  This is the real medical grade.
[03:46:43.704 --> 03:46:52.032]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[03:46:52.613 --> 03:46:55.535]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[03:47:26.866 --> 03:47:28.527]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:28.607 --> 03:47:30.427]  Thank you so much for joining this final segment.
[03:47:30.487 --> 03:47:33.068]  Liam will join me again tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:47:33.648 --> 03:47:34.168]  to 3 p.m.
[03:47:34.208 --> 03:47:41.471]  Central with the rest of the great crew for the weekday show, because I want her to be able to get through all she wants to talk about, because I was frustrated as a man.
[03:47:41.531 --> 03:47:42.511]  I can't imagine a woman.
[03:47:42.931 --> 03:47:45.592]  I'm just saying, if you're a woman, you're for Hillary, you're for George Soros.
[03:47:46.233 --> 03:47:47.053]  It is so crazy.
[03:47:47.093 --> 03:47:52.335]  But speaking of Gloria Steinem, I remember hearing Rush Limbaugh when I was a senior in high school, like 1992.
[03:47:54.893 --> 03:48:01.098]  Gloria Steinem in her new book admits that she was CIA and it was meant to break up the family and take control of things for social engineering.
[03:48:01.638 --> 03:48:09.104]  So I went home because I knew my mother had seen that book on the coffee table like a month before and I picked it up and flipped to where Rush had said and there it was.
[03:48:09.905 --> 03:48:17.511]  So I'd mentioned that many times over the years and I would get emails and the news would say, you can look this up, Jones claims the CIA ran the feminist movement.
[03:48:17.911 --> 03:48:18.852]  Yeah, they did stuff like
[03:48:20.123 --> 03:48:21.523]  Almost no women smoke cigarettes.
[03:48:22.324 --> 03:48:23.384]  How do we get up to worldwide?
[03:48:23.404 --> 03:48:25.765]  We'll just say it's feminist to smoke cigarettes, Edward Bernays.
[03:48:25.825 --> 03:48:26.745]  We got articles on that.
[03:48:26.765 --> 03:48:30.706]  In fact, tomorrow I'll do more on this, but you guys pulled up some of the articles for me.
[03:48:31.767 --> 03:48:32.067]  There it is.
[03:48:32.087 --> 03:48:34.147]  The torches of freedom is what they called it.
[03:48:34.167 --> 03:48:35.588]  Your husband won't let you smoke cigarettes.
[03:48:35.988 --> 03:48:37.509]  The point is, smoke one if you want.
[03:48:37.549 --> 03:48:39.209]  They just said, be a woman, be cool.
[03:48:39.229 --> 03:48:40.269]  Torches of freedom.
[03:48:40.289 --> 03:48:41.530]  Because they targeted women.
[03:48:42.170 --> 03:48:42.991]  Hitler did as well.
[03:48:43.451 --> 03:48:50.876]  And then the next thing was, you know, Eber Bernays and all this other garbage about going after the family, breaking it up.
[03:48:51.356 --> 03:48:52.477]  And then Gloria Steinem and Ms.
[03:48:52.517 --> 03:48:56.200]  Magazine and the CIA and ugly art and break down the family.
[03:48:56.260 --> 03:48:56.780]  It's all there.
[03:48:57.180 --> 03:49:00.603]  So today I said, hey, Google her book.
[03:49:00.743 --> 03:49:05.606]  And Nico Acosta, our head producer, goes, no, no, look, this is 60 Minutes in the 60s.
[03:49:07.020 --> 03:49:10.301]  And so, I was like, whoa, this just went up a little while ago.
[03:49:10.781 --> 03:49:16.322]  Here's part of it where she talks about the CIA and the foundations wanting to work with her.
[03:49:16.862 --> 03:49:19.043]  Again, it's not about empowering women.
[03:49:19.583 --> 03:49:23.504]  It's about making you totally poor, turning men into betas, and ending society.
[03:49:23.544 --> 03:49:23.904]  Here it is.
[03:49:24.944 --> 03:49:29.005]  Gloria, at the festival you worked for the Independent Research Service.
[03:49:29.065 --> 03:49:29.445]  That's right.
[03:49:31.329 --> 03:49:36.992]  Exactly when did your own association with the CIA start, and in what fashion?
[03:49:37.112 --> 03:49:39.373]  Did they come to you, or did you go to them?
[03:49:40.214 --> 03:49:56.442]  In 1958, when I came home from India, I discussed with student leaders, past and present, many of them active with the National Student Association, this kind of small foundation to encourage Americans to go.
[03:49:57.182 --> 03:49:58.503]  They thought it was a good idea too.
[03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:14.792]  I was then told by foundations and professors and friends that it, that I should not do this, that I would get in trouble with the House Un-American Activities Committee, the American Legion, uh, all of the... They're still battling this.
[03:50:15.973 --> 03:50:17.074]  ...fifties people.
[03:50:17.094 --> 03:50:20.357]  Uh, and I became convinced that it was impossible.
[03:50:21.138 --> 03:50:23.580]  It was at that point that the student leaders said to
[03:50:26.526 --> 03:50:35.673]  Oh, let's stop right there.
[03:50:36.454 --> 03:50:38.456]  Miss Magazine, the mainstream media, all of it.
[03:50:38.536 --> 03:50:42.199]  Not to empower women, but to totally enslave women.
[03:50:42.219 --> 03:50:43.299]  Look at the statistics today.
[03:50:43.380 --> 03:50:44.881]  Illegitimacy, it's all collapsing.
[03:50:46.422 --> 03:50:48.003]  The illiteracy, it's all there.
[03:50:48.844 --> 03:50:51.005]  Leanne, it's crazy that this is in her book.
[03:50:51.026 --> 03:50:53.547]  And I can pull up the articles where they said it didn't exist.
[03:50:53.948 --> 03:50:55.149]  Now we have her on film.
[03:50:55.540 --> 03:50:55.740]  Right.
[03:50:56.040 --> 03:51:00.623]  Yeah, I remember doing a big report about this and just cultural Marxism and where it really all started.
[03:51:00.703 --> 03:51:04.284]  And it wasn't about empowering women to get them in the workforce.
[03:51:04.364 --> 03:51:09.807]  It was about creating new tax income, new slave workers, breaking up the family.
[03:51:09.887 --> 03:51:14.730]  I mean, this is a whole big plan that, as we can see, Gloria Steinem has been a part of it for decades.
[03:51:15.430 --> 03:51:20.873]  And, you know, women just think that it's their, we are ripping away their rights, their freedom.
[03:51:20.953 --> 03:51:23.314]  And they think making men, it's like we're in competition with men.
[03:51:24.154 --> 03:51:27.879]  Men already are 40% of the college graduates.
[03:51:27.959 --> 03:51:29.040]  Don't worry, men are gone.
[03:51:29.080 --> 03:51:29.761]  There's no men left.
[03:51:29.801 --> 03:51:30.241]  It's all over.
[03:51:31.162 --> 03:51:31.843]  Everything's wrecked.
[03:51:32.144 --> 03:51:37.750]  It was all literally... I have in Endgame 2.0 all the documents where they admit everything.
[03:51:37.770 --> 03:51:39.832]  The chemicals in the water to in men.
[03:51:40.553 --> 03:51:41.114]  It's really bad.
[03:51:41.294 --> 03:51:51.540]  Well, here's the thing that's really infuriating to me, is that women are always kind of at the front lines when there's any kind of movement, civil rights, this and that, but who's going to speak up for them when they're obsolete?
[03:51:51.560 --> 03:52:04.848]  Because if you look at the cover of National Geographic magazine and it's like the gender revolution, they have a man, they have a transgender man, a bi-gender woman, a transgender woman, a transgender woman, and then some other
[03:52:05.448 --> 03:52:06.989]  That's very astute what you just said.
[03:52:07.009 --> 03:52:08.809]  What you just said is so astute.
[03:52:09.069 --> 03:52:13.251]  In Charlotte Isserby's document she released as the head of the Department of Education.
[03:52:13.811 --> 03:52:14.671]  She was the number two in it.
[03:52:14.691 --> 03:52:16.151]  This is in the 80s.
[03:52:17.152 --> 03:52:18.752]  They say it's Brave New World, 1932.
[03:52:19.012 --> 03:52:23.134]  The plan is no gender, all test tubes.
[03:52:23.774 --> 03:52:25.895]  So of course they get women to go, oh men are your enemy.
[03:52:25.935 --> 03:52:28.295]  You're the main target because women are the species.
[03:52:28.355 --> 03:52:33.477]  Everybody's a girl when they're first embryonic and then the genetics chooses to make a male to defend the women.
[03:52:33.757 --> 03:52:39.243]  But you're just your heterosexual female woman, not represented at all on there.
[03:52:39.263 --> 03:52:47.612]  A woman who is just your typical woman who wants to love a man and start a family and you're unnecessary, you're not a part of the gender revolution.
[03:52:48.032 --> 03:52:49.333]  I mean, to me that is insane.
[03:52:49.353 --> 03:52:50.955]  Like, women fight on Twitter.
[03:52:51.175 --> 03:52:55.160]  They're like, don't talk about your period because not all women have vaginas.
[03:52:55.320 --> 03:52:56.301]  Like, I'm sorry, what?
[03:52:56.621 --> 03:52:58.882]  You're going to just- It's all about an attack on the species.
[03:52:59.262 --> 03:53:00.943]  It's all about a shutdown of the species, Leigh-Anne.
[03:53:01.063 --> 03:53:01.283]  Right.
[03:53:01.483 --> 03:53:02.483]  I want to show a clip here.
[03:53:03.704 --> 03:53:04.164]  Come back tomorrow.
[03:53:04.184 --> 03:53:04.864]  You promise for an hour?
[03:53:04.924 --> 03:53:05.284]  I promise.
[03:53:05.404 --> 03:53:06.385]  Because this is so huge.
[03:53:07.385 --> 03:53:09.286]  Again, I'm going to show you- I have them all here.
[03:53:09.326 --> 03:53:10.126]  We printed them all up.
[03:53:10.206 --> 03:53:11.967]  This is all declassified.
[03:53:13.067 --> 03:53:17.089]  And I want to play a clip of one of our reporters there in D.C.
[03:53:17.169 --> 03:53:19.109]  yesterday at the Women's March.
[03:53:19.470 --> 03:53:24.051]  And there's dozens of hours of this with our four or five reporters that were there, including myself.
[03:53:24.792 --> 03:53:28.493]  And they would say, hey, Saudi Arabia is who really funds Hillary.
[03:53:28.513 --> 03:53:32.114]  And they would say, oh, no, Donald Trump's the one that got that funding.
[03:53:32.134 --> 03:53:33.475]  And then we kind of moved on.
[03:53:33.515 --> 03:53:37.317]  But the point is, he got zero money from Saudi Arabia that literally enslaves women.
[03:53:37.337 --> 03:53:38.677]  And that's what's so crazy.
[03:53:38.717 --> 03:53:40.658]  They're bitching at the West that was about
[03:53:41.889 --> 03:53:43.330]  The whole West is about worshipping the goddess.
[03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:44.591]  Let's just get down to brass tacks.
[03:53:44.932 --> 03:53:49.655]  The entire Magna Carta, Western government, the whole Renaissance is about empowering women.
[03:53:49.996 --> 03:53:57.882]  We're the place that empowered them and now they're like there with Islamic jihad wearing hoods on their heads saying you're a white male or you're a Westerner, F you!
[03:53:58.623 --> 03:54:03.386]  So this is, this is, this is total victims worshipping their abusers.
[03:54:03.426 --> 03:54:03.787]  Here it is.
[03:54:04.411 --> 03:54:19.849]  What do you think about countries like Saudi Arabia that totally oppress women and will stone them to death for, you know, having sex outside of marriage or for any little thing that they do?
[03:54:19.889 --> 03:54:20.670]  What do you think about that?
[03:54:22.392 --> 03:54:28.056]  It's outrageous, and I think that all women deserve their human rights.
[03:54:28.856 --> 03:54:32.539]  In every single country, within every single nation, we all deserve the same rights.
[03:54:32.579 --> 03:54:36.882]  We all deserve respect, and we all deserve to be treated exactly like men are treated.
[03:54:36.922 --> 03:54:41.625]  Maybe even, like, we're not asking for special permission.
[03:54:41.665 --> 03:54:46.008]  We're asking for, like, the same, like, criminal justice.
[03:54:52.372 --> 03:54:59.856]  She raised millions of dollars for her campaign, which compared to what Donald Trump raised is incomparable.
[03:54:59.876 --> 03:55:02.538]  He used the money that he raised to pay for a portrait.
[03:55:02.578 --> 03:55:05.820]  I think what Hillary Clinton did is amazing and it's a shame.
[03:55:16.866 --> 03:55:22.588]  Alright, so these same women don't know she raised 50 times the corporate money Trump did, literally.
[03:55:22.608 --> 03:55:24.248]  That Saudi Arabia gave no money.
[03:55:24.268 --> 03:55:28.209]  They just say, oh a portrait, oh he had no crew, he had no audience.
[03:55:28.889 --> 03:55:29.990]  Saudi Arabia loves me.
[03:55:31.210 --> 03:55:32.650]  This is upside down world, Leigh-Anne.
[03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:35.431]  It's absolutely flipped, inverted reality.
[03:55:35.611 --> 03:55:39.012]  We are dealing with people who are living in a dual reality and we have to remember that.
[03:55:39.052 --> 03:55:42.573]  That's why it feels... How do women look under Islam versus with Trump?
[03:55:43.213 --> 03:55:45.294]  Women are like on a pedestal with Trump.
[03:55:45.354 --> 03:55:46.054]  How are they with Islam?
[03:55:46.718 --> 03:55:48.118]  Well, they're oppressed.
[03:55:48.199 --> 03:55:50.619]  Just by nature, you are the underclass.
[03:55:50.839 --> 03:55:52.800]  You can get stoned for being raped.
[03:55:52.840 --> 03:55:53.760]  You can get phoned in jail.
[03:55:53.780 --> 03:55:55.161]  If you're the victim of rape... Oh, no, no.
[03:55:55.181 --> 03:55:55.661]  They do that.
[03:55:55.721 --> 03:55:58.962]  You get raped and you report it because rape is ubiquitous?
[03:55:59.262 --> 03:56:00.103]  You are killed!
[03:56:00.503 --> 03:56:03.944]  And then you've shamed your family so they can, you know, honor kill you.
[03:56:03.984 --> 03:56:04.944]  Or acid on your face.
[03:56:04.984 --> 03:56:05.304]  Right.
[03:56:05.464 --> 03:56:08.065]  I mean... Yeah, what kind of dad kills their 10-year-old daughter?
[03:56:08.085 --> 03:56:09.546]  There's a bunch of thugs raping her.
[03:56:09.586 --> 03:56:10.546]  I'll go kill those people.
[03:56:10.566 --> 03:56:11.866]  I'm not gonna kill my daughter.
[03:56:11.927 --> 03:56:12.947]  Yeah, it's your fault.
[03:56:13.615 --> 03:56:17.638]  You know, because you didn't cover your hair, or you let your ankles show in public.
[03:56:18.058 --> 03:56:21.681]  So, or you went out to the grocery store by yourself without your male escort.
[03:56:21.701 --> 03:56:22.382]  Look, let's just say it.
[03:56:23.042 --> 03:56:25.084]  Modern Islam particularly is about...
[03:56:26.860 --> 03:56:28.201]  Covering the sun that is women.
[03:56:28.522 --> 03:56:31.845]  It's all about just putting a bag over the most beautiful thing there is.
[03:56:32.165 --> 03:56:35.108]  Well, women in the West have more rights than anyone.
[03:56:35.208 --> 03:56:37.190]  We're more free than any other country.
[03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:40.092]  Men have less rights than us, frankly.
[03:56:40.693 --> 03:56:41.874]  We have it great here.
[03:56:41.894 --> 03:56:45.978]  So the fact that you have all these women out there in just a total wally world.
[03:56:45.998 --> 03:56:46.558]  I'm not just saying this.
[03:56:46.599 --> 03:56:48.741]  Look at chivalry is all about women on a pedestal.
[03:56:49.346 --> 03:56:50.907]  Let me open the door for you.
[03:56:50.967 --> 03:56:54.430]  And yeah, someone will say, oh, well that's because they assume that I'm just weaker.
[03:56:54.470 --> 03:56:57.512]  And I'm like, no, obviously I can open up a door.
[03:56:57.572 --> 03:57:01.335]  But I really appreciate it when a guy's like, here you go, woman.
[03:57:01.555 --> 03:57:04.417]  What it says is men are ready to die for their families.
[03:57:04.537 --> 03:57:05.117]  Exactly.
[03:57:05.137 --> 03:57:12.843]  And I mean, that to me is one of the reasons why I'm... Instead, in Islamic countries, they use the women and children for bombs because they don't matter.
[03:57:13.163 --> 03:57:13.903]  Only men matter.
[03:57:14.104 --> 03:57:14.504]  Exactly.
[03:57:15.545 --> 03:57:16.525]  It's a total inversion.
[03:57:16.565 --> 03:57:17.206]  It makes me sick.
[03:57:17.546 --> 03:57:17.766]  Yeah.
[03:57:18.026 --> 03:57:19.166]  No, you're so right with that.
[03:57:19.246 --> 03:57:28.528]  And that's, that's where, what happened to the honor with the, with honoring the fact that men would put their lives on the line for their family, but now it's that, oh, you're so pathetic.
[03:57:28.568 --> 03:57:31.229]  You can't even buy the right cereal at the grocery store.
[03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:32.489]  Oh, I'll do it myself.
[03:57:32.589 --> 03:57:34.289]  Every show is about how dumb men are.
[03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.589]  Right.
[03:57:34.649 --> 03:57:35.550]  And we've been made pathetic.
[03:57:35.570 --> 03:57:37.130]  The average man just doesn't know what to do.
[03:57:37.150 --> 03:57:38.950]  They're totally collapsing.
[03:57:39.250 --> 03:57:39.710]  It's sick.
[03:57:39.730 --> 03:57:41.011]  Leeann, great points.
[03:57:41.071 --> 03:57:42.291]  What an amazing broadcast.
[03:57:52.015 --> 03:57:53.367]  Welcome to the War Room.
